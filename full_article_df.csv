But then the blast came — killing 200 people, wounding 6,000 and, in the process, destroying her sister’s house. Joelle Sakr Kaitlyn Nuebel | Staff Writer packed up her belongings in Cranberry Township, located Joelle Sakr and her brother Elie Sakr are the owners of Divvy Coffee and about 30 minutes north of Oakland, and flew to Lebanon to Buns, a new coffee shop on Forbes Avenue. visit her family. When she returned to Pittsburgh in September, she had a decision to make. “I saw that everything was shattered in a fraction of a second and how people lost their lives and their houses, their businesses, everything,” Joelle Sakr said. “I’m like, ‘I cannot wait for the right time, there’s no right moment. Either you do it or you don’t do it.’” Sitting in a fuchsia chair inside Divvy Coffee & Buns, which she opened with her brother seven weeks earlier, Joelle Sakr said she wanted to create an alternative to the commercial coffee shops typically found in the City. “Whatever coffee shop you walk to, especially around Pittsburgh, for me, they all look sorta alike,” Joelle Sakr said. “I was trying to bring something new that people would stop and say, ‘This is a little different.’” Sakr said she designed Divvy, decorated with a pink flower wall and framed maps, to have a European influence and emphasis on travel. Having dreamt about opening a coffee shop for the past 10 years, Joelle Sakr put thought into each decision. She sat on the velvet couch — where she’s seen students doze off — to make sure it felt comfortable, and picked black tables and shimmering gold chairs to resemble what she described as “Pittsburgh, but trendier.” "", ""Now Joelle Sakr spends her time at Divvy making coffee, chatting with customers and placing fresh flowers at the coffee station. She said she wants people who enter the shop to feel at home — a desire that comes from moving to Pittsburgh as a teenager and feeling welcomed. “Even though maybe for a couple of months I had that cultural shock, later on, I found everybody’s super supportive and everybody’s very welcoming and very nice to you,” Joelle Sakr said. Raised in a family with a love for coffee and traveling — their first job after arriving in a new city is looking for a coffee shop — Joelle Sakr noticed Pittsburgh lacked the coffee shops she saw in other cities which give off an international vibe. “We have the diverse population but we don’t have a place to gather the diverse population,” Joelle Sakr said. What makes Divvy diverse is less about what’s hanging on the walls and more about what’s on the menu. In the kitchen, Elie Sakr and his wife Leila bake brioche using a Sakr family recipe that’s been passed down for generations. It serves as the bun for sandwiches on the “Destination Savory Heavens” menu, but when stuffed with butter and topped with a coffee crust, becomes the base for the coffee buns served on the “Destination Sweet Paradise” menu. Each sandwich and coffee bun — inspired by cities where the Sakrs have traveled, want to visit or know people — combines their Lebanese brioche recipe with ingredients typically found in other cities around the world. The “Sweet Paris” offers customers a taste of France, with a coffee bun topped with Nutella, strawberries, bananas, hazelnuts and whipped cream. Go with the “Evening in Roma,” on the other hand, and they’ll get a coffee bun with sweet cream, drizzled with dulce de leche syrup and topped with a biscotti. Sandwiches, like the “Habibi Beirut,” offer customers something not as sweet but — with mozzarella cheese, fresh mint and tomatoes — something they still can’t find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Those who don’t like bread can get a salad or acai bowl, and those there for the drinks have choices ranging from lattes and frappuccinos to flavored teas and Turkish coffee. Coffee buns and sandwiches, which cost $6.99, can be paired with a suggested drink for a total price starting at $7.50. “It’s a tradition in our family just because we love coffee that we always had the coffee bun with everything,” Joelle Sakr said. This is where the name Divvy — referring to coffee divvied with a bun — comes from. But aside from a nuanced menu, Divvy also offers customers a place to eat and work. Juliet Serra, a firstyear environmental studies major, said she got breakfast with a group of friends the first time she went to the coffee shop. She returned the next day for the same thing — a sausage egg and cheese sandwich — and a place to study. “It’s on the way to where I have to do my psych study so I was like, ‘I’ll just stop here first,’” Serra said. “And it’s more substantial than Starbucks so I figured I would get something that felt like actual food.” Joelle Sakr said Divvy gets the most traffic from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. before lightening up in the afternoon, as some people study and others chat. In the future, she wants her coffee shop to be a place where customers know each other and feel comfortable interacting. “I want everybody that comes here to be connected somehow,” Joelle Sakr said. She’s already seen this happen with some of her staff who, despite not knowing each other prior to working at Divvy, spend time together outside work. "", ""“Friendships, they’re forming,” Sakr said. “I feel like my vision somehow, even if it started with my employees, is being real.” Still, Joelle Sakr envisions more happening at the shop — she wants to add new items to the menu and bring in a jazz band to play one night. First, though, she said she’s focused on hiring more staff. “I’d rather wait until we’re fully ready in the kitchen, behind the bar, until everybody’s trained the right way on how we do things, and then we will start coming up with newer ideas,” Joelle Sakr said. “But I don’t want this place to be boring.” Elie Sakr also has plans for Divvy, specifically to expand to more locations. “This is a smaller thing than what we were thinking. I want to see it go to the next level, especially in Pittsburgh,” Elie Sakr said. But for right now, Elie Sakr said he’s focused on serving coffee buns — Lebanon topped with a little Paris or Rome, and served in Pittsburgh. “I’m working on that bun to get it to people the way that we need it,” Elie Sakr said.

PN_CB02," Matt Vogt | The once caddie, now dentist, and always Pittsburgh native prepares for the U.S. Open By Aidan Kasner, Sports Editor Not too long ago, Matt Vogt was just a caddie at Oakmont Country Club with an “absolute pipe dream” to one day play a U.S. Open on the course that meant so much to him. Vogt is now a dentist — with the same dream — and it’s about to come true. After an impressive performance at “Golf’s longest day,” Vogt quickly went from filling cavities to filling one of the coveted spots in the 156man field at the 2025 U.S. Open. “It means so much,” Vogt said on qualifying for the tournament so close to his hometown in Cranberry Township. Matthew Scabilloni | Contributing Editor “I’m still trying to soak it all in, but also not to get too Matt Vogt hits a tee shot off of the first tee at Oakmont Country Club during sentimental about it because it’s incredible.” a practice round on Wednesday, June 11 Vogt caddied at Oakmont for six years, helping out OCC as it helped him — a feeling he reflected on in his opening press conference. “Even as I just talk about it now, I get sentimental about it. This place means so much to me. The members are incredible. Stanley Druckenmiller, a prominent member here, provided me and a lot of the caddies with a scholarship to help with college,” Vogt said. “So I’m just indebted to this place, and I’m so grateful. I’m just so grateful, honestly.” Pgatour.com called the story, “a modernday U.S. Open fairytale,” and they are not wrong. Vogt is the 1,173rd ranked amateur golfer in the world — now with a chance to compete on golf’s biggest stage next to the most prominent names in the sport. Vogt knows his story is unbelievable, and besides shooting for the stars — or in his case — the putting green, he isn’t going to deny the opportunity to encourage others and prove doubters wrong. “That’s one of my goals in doing all this this week, besides obviously doing the best I can in the golf tournament, is just to inspire some people, to let them know that it’s never too late to try to pursue something in your life that you think is really cool, and it’s something you want to do that other people think might be foolish or might be a waste of your time or maybe don’t believe in you,” Vogt said. Vogt’s fairytale extends far off the links too. After arriving at Oakmont, Vogt was met with many fans, and for someone who has never played in front of more than 100 people and will soon teeoff in front of more than 10,000, the moment was “awesome.” “The coolest part is seeing kids out there,” Vogt said. “It’s a true honor to be a part of that, to just see kids like that and, I guess, make a good impression on them here on the golf course.” As far as expectations, Vogt doesn’t have any, and is focused more on letting his love for the sport carry him through the week. “I don’t have a specific goal this week. I don’t have expectations, and I don’t have the same going forward. It’s just what’s possible,” Vogt said. “It’s all because I love golf so much. I love the people that you come in contact with. I love the places that you end up. That’s honestly what it’s all about for me at this point.” Watch Vogt tee off at 6:45 a.m. in the first group on Thursday with hopes to carry on the legend sweeping this year’s U.S. Open.

PN_CB03," Opinion | 10 things to look forward to in 2025 By Brynn Murawski, Staff Columnist New Year’s is always a scary time for me, full of doubt, fear and resistance to change. I feel like I only hear about the bad things that might be coming, and while it’s important to have a realistic view of our future, it’s also important to have something to look forward to. Here, I have compiled a list of 10 things to look forward to in 2025 for anyone feeling frightened or just dreading leaving 2024 behind. New Movies and Shows: One of my favorite things to do is sit down with a bag of chips and a little drinky and watch hours of television and movies. Some highly anticipated releases include book adaptation “Percy Jackson and the Olympians,” the final season of “Stranger Things” and the second season of “The Last of Us.” Marvel is expected to release a whole host of new shows including “Ironheart,” “Daredevil: Born Again” and “Your Friendly Neighborhood SpiderMan.” Other new series include Seth Rogen’s “The Studio” and a new medical drama taking place in our very own city titled “The Pitt.” Plus, for all the “Game of Thrones” fans out there, “A Olga Tseytlin | Staff Illustrator Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight” may fill the void left by “House of the Dragon.” Superhero fans can get excited for new Marvel films like “Captain America: Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” while sequel fans will love “Wicked: Part Two,” “Jurassic World: Rebirth,” “Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning” and “Freakier Friday.” There will even be another “Knives Out” film titled “Wake Up Dead Man.” Don’t forget new standalone movies like animated “Elio” following a young space fanatic encountering aliens or Bong Joon Ho’s scifi “Mickey 17” starring Robert Pattinson as an “expendable.” New Games: Whether you like video games or you prefer board games, 2025 holds exciting new releases for you. Fans of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” can look forward to “Avatar: Journey of Aang,” a board game allowing 14 players to help Aang on his journey to master the elements. Or maybe you’re a fan of myths and legends, in which case you’ll love “Knights of the Round Table,” where you and your friends can find the holy grail. On the digital side, gamers can look forward to a new Monster Hunter game, a new Doom game, a new Assassin’s Creed game and maybe, just maybe, Grand Theft Auto 6. New Music: As we celebrate Spotify Wrapped season, next year’s new music is on a lot of our minds. While we have some confirmed releases like Lana Del Rey’s new album “The Right Person Will Stay” or Tate McCrae’s upcoming “So Close to What,” there’s so much music that we can’t even know about yet, since artists rarely announce an album more than a couple months prior to its release. Taylor Swift has been sitting on her rerecords of “Reputation” and “Debut” for a while, and we can probably expect albums from artists like Lady Gaga and Kesha. But who knows? Perhaps we’ll get a total surprise album like Kendrick Lamar’s recent drop “GNX.” Local Excitement: We have a couple confirmed new restaurants and businesses coming to our area in 2025, like a Kyuramen set to open in Cranberry and East End, Lebanese regional chain Mezeh coming to South Fayette and a new shopping and dining center The Meridian, which will feature a Giant Eagle Market District and Shake Shack among other businesses, at the corner of Shady and Penn Avenues. Pittsburghers can also look forward to the return of favorite traditions like the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, Pittsburgh Pride, Picklesburgh, Anthrocon, Three Rivers Arts Festival and the Pittsburgh Renaissance Faire. Astrological Events: 2025 has a whole host of awesome astrological phenomena to look forward to. Everything from meteor showers to a blood moon will decorate our skies in the coming year. So plan ahead, grab a blanket and some friends and take a drive to enjoy all the celestial beauty our world has to offer. Global Progress: It’s important to remember the good things happening globally in 2025. Thailand is set to legalize same sex marriage on Jan. 23. South Africa will host the upcoming G20 Summit, making it the first country in Africa to do so. Norway aims to ban the sale of all new diesel and petrol cars by 2025. On the scientific front, the Artemis II mission will be the first crewed mission since 1972 to fly "", ""beyond lower Earth orbit as four astronauts perform a flyby of the moon. New Books: I already can’t wait to read “Sunrise on The Reaping,” the upcoming addition to Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games universe slated for a March 2025 release. But even if you lack taste and don’t care about the Hunger Games, there’s plenty of exciting new stuff to read. Fans of “BookTok” can get excited for novels from authors like Lynn Painter and Emily Henry, but for more indepth lists at the myriad of new literature to consume, you can look here and here. Sporting Events: While it may come as no shock that I’m not the biggest sports fan — though recently I’ve found myself more intrigued by football than ever before — I’d be remiss not to mention how much cool stuff is coming up in the athletic sphere. From the Super Bowl to the Winter Special Olympics or the FIFA World Cup, there are lots of massive events to look forward to. New Foods: What else are they going to put in an Oreo? Will Trader Joe’s finally bring back the Nacho Cheese Chips that I adore? These are questions only 2025 can answer. Of course, companies try to keep most new releases relatively under wraps, but we do know McDonalds is introducing its McValue Menu, chockfull of great deals on your favorite meals. Meanwhile, soda lovers can look forward to some speculated releases like SpriteTea, Blackberry Dr. Pepper, and Tropical 7UP. Everything Else: Unfortunately, I am not a psychic. I can’t really know all of the great things happening next year. But that means the best things to happen next year aren’t even on this list. You could meet the love of your life, or go on an amazing trip or get your dream job. Maybe you’ll get a new pet, or find a new favorite restaurant or spend more time with new friends. No matter what your upcoming year has in store, there will be something exciting and beautiful for you to experience. So when that clock strikes midnight, try to look on the bright side. Instead of imagining what might go wrong, imagine what might go right. Brynn Murawski is too busy hoping it’ll snow for Christmas to worry about New Year’s.

PN_CB04_kinda," ‘So special’: Taylor Swift fans flock to ‘Swiftsburgh’ by the thousands By Pamela Smith, EditorinChief For sophomore nursing major Mallory Moran, Taylor Swift’s arrival in Pittsburgh has been (like Swift herself says in the opening song of The Eras Tour) a long time coming. “I’ve loved her for forever,” Moran said. “Like, we’d grown up listening to her like every day so it’s just awesome being here and being able to support her.” With two concerts in Pittsburgh this past weekend, Taylor Swift drew a large crowd of all ages and from all over to the North Shore Friday and Saturday for the Pittsburgh stop of Swift’s ‘Eras’ tour. Beaded friendship bracelets worn by Taylor Swift fans outside of Acrisure Pittsburgh residents and visitors alike crowded Acrisure Stadium before Swift’s performance on June 17. Stadium for Swift’s threehour concert, and Mayor Ed Gainey dubbed the city “Swiftsburgh” for the weekend. With an attendance of 73,117, the Saturday performance became the most attended event at the venue to date. Adorned in sequins, glitter and song references, fans known as “Swifties” expressed excitement at the idea of seeing Swift perform in person. Some tailgated in the stadium parking lots, and many swapped beaded friendship bracelets as a reference to lyrics in Swift’s “You’re On Your Own, Kid.” Allison Larrimer of Cranberry Township enjoyed the environment that fans created before the show, having attended both nights of the tour in Pittsburgh. “I’m just really excited,” Larrimer said. “I absolutely love the atmosphere and like the friendship bracelet trading and everything and it’s just super fun. I really enjoy being here.” Larrimer, like many Swift fans, experienced issues with getting tickets through online ticketing platforms such as Ticketmaster, saying it took hours in line to purchase them. Cortney Roth, of Robinson Township, said she waited eight and a half hours on Ticketmaster for tickets. Amy B. of McCandless described the wait as “torture.” She and her sister Kara purchased tickets on the resale market. “It’s a secret how much I spent,” Kara said. Other fans got luckier with tickets, such as junior rehabilitation sciences major Lydia Queen. “Personally, I was sitting in a study room in Posvar when I was getting tickets with a friend and we were so excited,” Queen said. “We were screaming and I’m sure all the people around us could hear us when we finally got them.” Vinoj M. traveled from Australia to see Swift perform for the first time in Pittsburgh. “I found out that I was going like two weeks ago.” Vinoj said. “And it was insane. I had to travel for like 26 hours, but it was all worth it for Taylor.” He described the connections that Swift’s fans and music helped him form, and said seeing her in person was a “lifelong dream.” "", ""“Taylor has connected me to so many friends,” Vinoj said. “And now I actually get to like, enjoy music with her in the stadium. I don’t know — it just feels so special.” "")",Cranberry Township,event,2020-2025

PN_FH02_kinda," Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Park puts new spin on old works By Anoushka Parnerkar, For The Pitt News Baguettes, wigs and hiphop aren’t usually what come to mind when 17th century English playwright William Shakespeare is mentioned. But Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks is breaking out of the norm with a quirky retelling of the classic playwright’s wellknown works. PSiP’s most recent spring production, “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) [Revised],” is a 97minutes comedic interpretation of all 37 Shakespearean plays, including “Romeo and Juliet,” “Macbeth,” “Othello” and “Hamlet.” The play, which the Reduced Shakespeare Company wrote in 1987, is PSiP’s first nonShakespeare original play in its first indoor venue during the springtime — Image courtesy of Catherine Welsh Aceto as opposed to their typical late summer plays. Members of Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks perform “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) [Revised].” The show premiered last Wednesday, and will run until Saturday at the Threadbare Cider House in Pittsburgh’s Spring Garden neighborhood. The event is ticketed and all attendees are required to to be masked and vaccinated. The company also employed a COVID19 safety manager, Skylar Rella, who ensures that all pandemic guidelines are followed. Charles “Chuck” Beikert, who directs the show and has been with the company for seven years, said while PSiP typically sticks with plays that are written exclusively by Shakespeare, they decided to go with this play written by the Reduced Shakespeare Company. “However, the company has made its own changes to the script, hence the addition of the words “[Revised]” to the title of the play,” Beikert said. “They have incorporated quirky musical scenes, and niche Pittsburgh comedy, and have even integrated themselves into the script.” The play’s threeperson cast includes artistic director Jennifer Tober, along with actors Aaron Crutchfield and Charles “Stoney” David Richards, who each play themselves and rotate through nearly all of Shakespeare’s characters with a satirical twist. The Threadbare Cider House is an exindustrial warehouse now converted into sleek and stylish breweries serving up housemade ciders, locally distilled whiskey and pizza. Beikert said it was a perfect place for the company’s first indoor production. “It’s not outdoors. It’s indoors, it’s in a hip place … this threadbare joint over in a spring garden spot,” Beikert said. “It’s a cool place, a repurposed light industrial building. So I dig that kind of stuff.” Tober, the founder of PSiP as well as a producer, actress and artistic director, wanted to add a second show to the company’s lineup for the year. “We’ve done things here before and we’ve just loved it. And so we decided that it was time for us to add a second show, every year, instead of just doing one show a year,” Tober said. Beikert said he sees the production as the perfect way for the company to grow beyond their current sites in Pittsburgh parks. “For a while, I have been quietly hopeful that they would grow and expand,” Beikert said. “That’s how it goes. If you, if you perform in more than one park. You’re performing on more than one day, you’re reaching different people. If you go to a different type of venue and you perform a different kind of show, you’re reaching even more people and it’s all in line with what you want to do with the company.” Judy, an audience member from nearby Forest Hills, said she thought the play was amusing. "", ""“It was fun. It was clever,” she said. “And, yet it is Shakespeare all the way through.” Tober said she worked with each of the actors and the production team prior, and handpicked them for the production. “I asked Chuck Beikert to direct and then Stoney and Aaron to be in it with me. And we took it from there,” Tober said. While Tober said it was easy to find her ideal cast, putting on the production was challenging. “Complete works are so prop and costume heavy. I’m thinking maybe we’ll just do a rehearsed stage reading next time where we can read the script,” Tober said. “The script was a daunting task too. To learn the combination of the contemporary language and then the Shakespeare language. Wait, when, how does this all dovetail together? That was really hard.” Beikert said PSiP’s reopening was a success with the opening night and evening performances completely sold out. Following the COVID19 pandemicinduced break, Tober said the company is just glad to be back together. “You know, being able to have fun and to perform in front of people,” Tober said. “It’s just, it’s the best feeling in the world.” Tober said one of the most enjoyable aspects of making these plays is the collaborative aspects shared between members of the production, especially for new interpretations like this one. “It’s just so much fun to think that we had this group of great people and everybody has his or her or their own job,” Tober said. “Together, we create this collaborative piece of art that hopefully entertains and educates and builds community. It’s just such a great feeling to think we’re doing this.” "" )",Forest Hills,event,2020-2025
PN_HD01," Mark Kramer: Writer and empathy farmer By Andrew McLaughlin, Staff Writer Walking into Mark Kramer’s office is like entering a mosaic of mementos. Pictures of his two children sit on his desk, and trinkets cover shelves along one wall. The shelves are also full of books that reflect one of his greatest passions — creative writing. Kramer said he discovered his love for writing while pursuing a bachelor’s degree at Miami University, but writing is just one of his many interests. After college, Kramer devoted time to community service and spent a year leading volunteer groups in Northeast Kentucky. “That was pretty formative, just to volunteer and be with Bhaskar Chakrabarti | Staff Photographer people who were having experiences that were new to them,” Mark Kramer poses for a photo outside The Corner in West Oakland. Kramer said. “We were getting our hands dirty building houses while meeting new people and experiencing a culture the students had never experienced..” Service remains an important theme in Kramer’s work and teaching. Following a stint in freelance journalism, Kramer earned his Master of Fine Arts at Pitt in 2009 and has worked at the University ever since. Currently, he is a teaching professor in the English department. “I see myself as a colearner, as a teacher,” Kramer said. “I have expertise, I tell students, but I also want to hear their expertise and their experiences.” In 2010, Kramer helped found The Corner, a community center in West Oakland that serves as a neighborhood outlet for the arts and social justice advocacy. Kramer said he lived in West Oakland at the time specifically because of his desire to be involved in community service. “I volunteered there for several years before becoming the executive director, and that taught me a lot about community work,” Kramer said. “I would say that’s been pretty central to my experience at Pitt as well.” Kramer describes himself as a “writer and empathy farmer” on his website, and he stressed empathy as a core theme both in the classroom and in his writing. “Empathy has been a longterm interest for me,” Kramer said. “In some ways, I feel like all my writing has been about empathy.” Kramer believes the ideal classroom environment is inclusive and democratic, pointing to one memorable class period in which students asked questions that took the class in a new direction. “I actually ended up almost on the outside of the conversation, and I said, ‘Hey, just run with it,’” Kramer said. “I’m continually trying to democratize the room as much as I can and let students take the lead.” For Kramer, his philosophy on teaching ultimately returns to empathy, providing takeaways for his students that go beyond improved writing. “My writing is about helping myself and my students understand what life is like in somebody else’s shoes,” Kramer said. “That’s an aspiration that I think we should all have.” "", ""Gayle Rogers, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of English and department chair, has worked with Kramer for over 15 years. In 2019, he helped nominate Kramer for the Chancellor’s Distinguished Service Award, which Pitt awarded to him in recognition of his work. “His students praise him endlessly for his dedication to helping them improve as writers through engagements with communities in need, especially communities that are not their own,” Rogers said. “It’s a remarkable skill.” Cheyenne Filous graduated from Pitt in 2018 and said her experience with Kramer as a professor was “invaluable.” “Mark created an atmosphere in class that felt both safe and empowering for all students to be subjected to constructive criticism — a necessary experience,” Filous said. “He went above and beyond in his role as an educator, and in him I found a mentor, an advocate and a friend.” Kramer’s freelance work has appeared on various news sites, including PublicSource, The Atlantic and Pittsburgh Quarterly. In 2006, he published a book titled “Dispossessed: Life in Our World’s Urban Slums,” in which he spent four years researching informal settlements worldwide. Whether in an article or a book, Kramer said his Mark Kramer poses for a photo outside The Corner in the Hill District. (Bhaskar Chakrabarti | Staff Photographer) work always returns to understanding the experiences of others. “Whether my writing is about informal settlements in another country or writing about the city of Pittsburgh, it’s about helping people have a vicarious experience,” Kramer said. Kramer also desires to understand history through empathy. When the travel and food show “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown” released an episode about Pittsburgh in 2017, Kramer authored a piece for the show’s website about the Civic Arena in the Hill District. This article profiled one of the more than 8,000 residents of the historically African American neighborhood displaced by the arena’s construction. “I got to write a piece that highlighted the life of somebody who grew up in the Hill and became a community leader,” Kramer said. “I was glad for that because it showed the context of the neighborhood as opposed to just the food featured in the show.” Kramer finds himself more comfortable in nature than in the city and sometimes feels as if he doesn’t fit into the Pittsburgh landscape. “I’m a little surprised I work in urban spaces, because I don’t feel like I fit in some ways,” Kramer said. “I grew up on five acres of land in rural Ohio, and I miss the woods.” As an outdoors enthusiast in an urban setting, Kramer said much of his writing is focused on the intersection of urban spaces with the natural environment. “I’m interested in income inequality, race and neighborhood change, but I’ve also been writing on urban nature and the integration of green spaces and urban spaces in Pittsburgh,” Kramer said. “And that does come back to justice issues too.” "", ""Many of Kramer’s articles reflect these themes, such as “The Urban Deerhunter,” which describes camouflaged deer hunters who hunt in wooded pockets around the city. Another article, one that he cited as a favorite, investigated the owner of a troubled apartment complex in Penn Hills. Despite Kramer’s inclination to the outdoors, he said Pittsburgh offers no shortage of interesting topics for his writing. JC Lee, a teaching professor in the English department, has long appreciated Kramer’s kindness. “He’s one of the most downtoearth people I know,” Lee said. “What I love about his teaching is that he has students get out of their own lives and experience a place that is unfamiliar to them.” Mark Kramer poses for a photo outside The Corner in the Hill District. (Bhaskar Chakrabarti | Staff Photographer) In the two decades that Lee has known him, many students have told Lee they enjoyed Kramer’s classes. “I often have students come through my classes who have taken Intermediate Nonfiction with Mark, and it’s been their favorite writing class,” Lee said. In the classroom, Kramer shares lessons learned through his own writing with his students but does not consider himself as “merely handing down expertise.” Kramer said he desires to learn alongside his students, and hearing their insights is why he enjoys being an educator. “We’re here to continually work toward an approximation of understanding, but we never fully arrive at understanding, and that’s the educational process,” Kramer said. “It’s not about becoming experts but to continually unlearn what we thought we knew.” When asked how he hopes to impact his students, Kramer said although improving one’s writing is an important goal, he wants to impart empathy and understanding to his students above all. “I want us to be thinking about who we are to other people around us,” Kramer said. “I do want [my students] to become more thoughtful writers … but I think even more than that, I want them to grow as people.” "" )",Hill District,displacement/gentrification,2020-2025
PN_HD02," Local History Day showcases Pittsburgh’s past By Andrew McLaughlin, Staff Writer The third floor of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in Oakland opened for the first time since late 2021 on Saturday, Nov. 4. The reopening of the third floor coincided with the library’s Local History Day event, which brought 17 local exhibitors, including the Lawrenceville Historical Society and Rivers of Steel, together to share the city’s history with the public. Ed Simon, author of “An Alternative History of Pittsburgh,” gave an opening lecture at noon where he talked about littleknown aspects of Pittsburgh’s past that are covered in his book, including the city’s legacy as a jazz pioneer. Andrew McLaughlin | Staff Writer A sign welcomes event participants to Local History Day at the Carnegie “Many are not aware that Pittsburgh was one of the most Library of Pittsburgh in Oakland on Nov. 4. notable cities regarding its contribution to jazz,” Simon said. “Billy Strayhorn grew up in Pittsburgh to become a legendary jazz composer, yet he also lived a tragic life arranging for Duke Ellington.” Simon also emphasized that Pittsburgh history includes many nationally significant anecdotes. They range from Lawrenceville’s Allegheny Arsenal explosion in 1862 — the deadliest civilian disaster of the Civil War — to the B52 bomber that crashed into the Monongahela River in 1956 during the Cold War. “Many local stories in Pittsburgh history were also very much national stories,” Simon said. “For instance, Roberto Clemente transcended news in Pittsburgh with his death in a plane crash on the way to provide relief in Nicaragua.” Pittsburghbased archives, museums and historical societies were set up on the library’s second and third floors, and the library prepared book displays of local history titles for the occasion. Amanda Peters, archivist at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, said that Local History Day is a perfect way to celebrate the public reopening of the library’s Pennsylvania Department, which specializes in local history and genealogy research. “We hope that visitors see their community represented and realize that many different groups are working to preserve local history,” Peters said. Presenting at Local History Day was Historic Pittsburgh, the digital collection service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Library System. Home to more than 35,000 images, Historic Pittsburgh is a fantastic online resource for those wanting to learn more about local history, according to Megan Massanelli, engagement and outreach librarian with the library system’s Archives and Special Collections department. “Our mission is to preserve the history and culture of Western Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh more generally, but we’re not limited to that,” Massanelli said. “Our collections range from political science to performing arts, and no matter what your interests are, there’s always something in our collections.” The event also included two historical tours of the Carnegie Library in the afternoon, sharing how the library connects with Pittsburgh’s industrial past. The glass floors of the library’s stacks are made with slag, a byproduct of coal, and the stacks themselves were built with Carnegie steel. "", ""“The fact that Andrew Carnegie was a tremendous philanthropist but also an exploitative industrialist makes him a fascinating character,” Simon said. “Yet there has never been a great novel or movie about Carnegie.” The Pittsburgh City Archives presented several photographs of the Lower Hill District, which was completely demolished for the Civic Arena sports complex in the 1960s. Giving a rare snapshot into the predominantly AfricanAmerican Lower Hill before mass demolition, City Archivist Charles Succop said that the photographs will be part of a new website soon to be launched by the City Archives. “We’ve always had these records, but we are going to be making history more accessible through digitization,” Succop said. At another table, the Detre Library and Archives at the Heinz History Center shared a few images from their collection. Archivist Sierra Green reinforced that local history gives one a greater passion for their home. “We see this initiative and passion towards sourcing things locally, like purchasing from local artisans or farmers markets,” Green said. “Why not do that with history?” Green is currently working on a project to document Pittsburgh’s lost Chinatown, once located downtown between Grant and Ross Streets. “I’m currently working with two people who grew up in Chinatown, one of whom was the last unofficial mayor of the area,” Green said. “Hearing their memories directly and then seeing how they connect with primary sources is quite inspiring.” Pittsburgh’s legacy of immigration lives on throughout the city, including at St. Nicolas Church in Millvale, where the 25 Maxo Vanka Murals represent the faith of Croatian immigrants on a grand scale. Vanka was a Croatianborn artist, and the WWIIera murals were recently the recipient of a $471,670 grant to continue an ongoing conservation project. Pittsburgh history inevitably continues to influence the people and places of the city, according to James Morar, who volunteers with Rivers of Steel to preserve Pittsburgh’s industrial history. “Many local residents come from families whose ancestors worked long, grueling days in the steel mills, and we can repay that debt left to us by learning about their pasts,” Morar said.

PN_HD03," ‘It’s ours to spread and to make new’: Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival showcases a harmonious fusion of artists at Highmark Stadium By Nada Abdulaziz, Staff Writer As people passed Highmark Stadium on a stroll by the Monongahela River, a soothing and enchanting melody hung in the air –– the unmistakable sound of jazz. The Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival brought together 14 jazz artists and groups on Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 16 and 17. The 10hour show supported a large array of artists, from Grammy Award recipients to Pittsburgh local jazz performers. Christie Dashiell, a singersongwriter, educator and the Hannah Levine | Staff Photographer second artist to take the stage on Saturday said it is her duty to continue spreading the art form of jazz. Dashiell said jazz The Spanish Harlem Orchestra performs during the Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival on Saturday at Highmark Stadium. is valuable and must continue to be promoted and supported “As I got older and decided to go to college for music, I got the sense that people felt like jazz was passé and old and really intellectual,” said Dashiell. “It’s my duty to make sure that people know about this music and this art form, it’s ours to spread and to make new, and to keep alive.” Dashiell said many jazz artists, including herself, dedicate a lot of effort to placing their identity into their music. Dashiell says jazz may be perceived as stagnant or dull because the listener does not fully delve into the music. “It’s about taking the music that we grew up on like gospel, R&B, soul, funk, and hiphop and integrating it and incorporating it into our music,” Dashiell said. “I think that people think jazz is old and they think it’s stale, but if you really dig into the music, it has a history of always taking culture and putting it inside of this improvised setting.” Chelsea Baratz, saxophonist, vocalist, composer and the first artist to play on Sunday, is a Pittsburgh local artist with deep roots in the city’s vibrant music scene. Baratz said her journey as a jazz musician began at a young age, and she hasn’t stopped since then. “I had teachers in both middle and high school who were the band directors and they were actively involved as professional musicians,” said Baratz. “My high school teacher was the one who told me to go to my first jam session ever at the Crawford Grill in the Hill District, which is a very historic venue in the history of jazz in Pittsburgh.” Baratz said she found inspiration as a child in the unlikeliest of places — “The Simpsons.” “As I think about the dynamics of influences and who we would see playing saxophones, I don’t really recall seeing many women saxophone players growing up,” Baratz said. “I was looking for role models to look up to musically, but there was something about Lisa Simpson, she was a soulful saxophone player who was doing justice to jazz and Black American music while being a young girl. I’m as serious as a heart attack when I say that Lisa Simpson is why I started playing the saxophone.” Andrey Chmut, a saxophonist and a member of the Bob James Quartet, said he had a very distinctive path that led him to jazz. "", ""“My dad was a pastor in a small church in western Ukraine and I saw a saxophone player there when I was nine years old and it blew my mind,” Chmut said. “When the war started in Ukraine, I moved to the United States and he [Bob James] called me and asked me to play on tour with him, I was very shocked and excited.” Chmut said he had grown accustomed to playing to a European audience and found challenges playing in the United States, the birthplace of jazz. Chmut said they have helped him develop his career as a jazz musician. “It’s very different playing music here compared to Ukraine, his music was born here in the US and it has a high level of listeners,” Chmut said. “For me, it’s a big challenge but I really like it because I can grow with my music.” Michael Palazzolo, an upright bass player and a member of the quartet, brings his music to life on a fourfoottall instrument. Palazzolo said there are many challenges to playing such a large instrument, and sometimes all he needs is luck. “I prefer smaller venues because of the instrument I play –– acoustic bass is better introduced into smaller rooms,” Palazzolo said. “One thing an upright bass player [faces] on tour is it’s challenging because you can’t bring your own bass unless you’re willing to risk the safety of it, so we rent the basses sometimes it’s a great bass, sometimes not so much.” Palazzolo said he finds value in playing as a group with Bob James on the keyboard, Andrey Chmut on the saxophone, James Adkins on the drums and himself on the bass. He emphasized the essence of the music he performs is rooted in teamwork. “I take the approach of I’m paying attention to the band, Bob is the leader so I’m trying to keep my eyes on him and James and Chmut, that’s the most important thing,” Palazzolo said. “If we’re a unit together, the audience will respond well to us.” Baratz also considers how the audience is responding to her music. She said her music is meant to positively affect the listeners’ mood and uplift their spirits. Baratz said playing jazz is what fixes her mood and she wants to do the same for other people. “There is something very powerful about what music can do to lift us up out of negativity,” Baratz said. “I want people to walk away with whatever was heavy on their spirit or whatever was making them feel bad, just gone. I genuinely want my music to be a prescription for people to feel good.” "" )",Hill District,art,2020-2025
PN_HD04," 4 things you didn’t know about Andy Warhol By Trinity Foster, Staff Writer Andy Warhol is well known for his distinctive screen printing style and brightly colored pop art ranging from Campbell’s Soup Cans to famous figures like Marilyn Monroe. Unsurprisingly, his personal life was as vibrant as his art. Grace Marston, Bloomfield resident and 11year arts educator at The Andy Warhol Museum, explained some of the most intriguing aspects of Warhol’s life. He was shot and nearly died Valerie Solanas, a radical feminist, shot Andy Warhol in the abdomen at The Factory, his studio in New York City, on June John Blair | Senior Staff Photographer 3, 1968. The bullet went diagonally through his torso and The Andy Warhol Museum in Northside. damaged several organs before doctors declared him dead and revived him. Although Warhol lived another 19 years after the shooting, it had a lasting effect. He had to wear a surgical corset to stabilize his organs and had followup surgeries, medications and organ damage for the rest of his life. Marston said unlike other feminists who believe in equality between the male and female sexes, Solanas hoped for female supremacy to “destroy the male sex,” as stated in her manifesto. “She wanted to eradicate men from the planet and create what she called a ‘groovy, allfemale world,’” Marston said. “She formed an organization called SCUM, an acronym for ‘Society for Cutting Up Men,’ and thought that, if she got enough followers, they could start this women’s revolution.” Solanas approached Warhol at The Factory and pitched her screenplay about a manhating prostitute who murdered her clients. Warhol rejected the obscene script, believing Solanas was a cop. “At this time, the NYPD was raiding Warhol’s studio on the suspicion that he was producing obscene materials with his films on a very regular basis,” Marston said. “When he first looked at this screenplay, he thought it was a trap. He thought Valerie Solanas was an undercover cop and that, if he made this movie, she would arrest him.” Then, Warhol lost Solanas’ script. Solanas, a paranoid schizophrenic, believed that he stole it. When she discovered that Warhol knew Maurice Girodias, the publisher of her “SCUM Manifesto,” she suspected a conspiracy between the two men to destroy her work. Although the men barely knew each other, Solanas decided she must kill them both to protect her writing. Girodias was out of the country on June 3, 1968, but Warhol was not so lucky. “She thought it would be good publicity for her if she assassinated him, because then she would be on the cover of magazines and newspapers and that would motivate more women to join her revolution. She turned herself in just a few hours after shooting Warhol so she could take all the credit and get all of the media attention,” Marston said. Prior to the shooting, The Factory was a hub for filmmaking, known for allowing anyone who entered to star in a movie. But the emotional trauma from the shooting pushed Warhol to change his work environment. “From ‘64 to ‘68, The Factory had an open door policy. After the shooting, they tightened security significantly. In 1969, Warhol founded Interview Magazine, which was another catalyst to change the social environment,” Marston said. “Rather than hanging out with a bunch of actors, drug addicts and people with mental illness, he surrounded himself with much more professional people.” "", ""The court sentenced Solanas to three years in prison. Her screenplay later surfaced from a trunk in The Factory after Warhol’s death in 1987. 2. He was a gay man and a devout Catholic Warhol’s sexuality was not widely discussed during his life, but greatly influenced his art, including his prints, films, TV shows, magazines and nude sketches. Warhol came out before many other celebrities at the time, such as Elton John or Freddie Mercury. One could argue that Warhol was the most famous openly gay man of his time, according to Marston. “His homosexuality did manifest in his art projects a great deal, whether in his homoerotic films from the ‘60s or Interview Magazine with a bunch of queer writers at the helm,” Marston said. “Even though he wasn’t marching in the streets for gay rights, he tried to empower other queer people in his community through his different art projects.” Another important facet of Warhol’s identity was Catholicism. His family came from a CarpathoRusyn background and he was raised Byzantine Catholic, often attending church multiple times a week, according to Marston. Warhol’s religion didn’t make an appearance in his work until late in his life, when he did a series on da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.” “It was something he was really private about. His friends knew he was raised Catholic, but they didn’t know how often he was going to church and that there would be a rosary tucked underneath his turtleneck so no one would see it,” Marston said. It wasn’t until Warhol’s funeral, where attendees included members of his church and the Catholic soup kitchen he volunteered in, that his devout Catholicism was more publicized. Marston speculates that Warhol was more open about his sexuality because it was viewed more positively by his peers. “It’s cooler among the people he’s hanging out with. He’s hanging out with more queer people than devout Catholics throughout his adult life, or former Catholics who had since abandoned their faith,” Marston said. “He was really interested in developing a personal brand. Being a devout Catholic doesn’t really fit in with the brand.” 3. He managed a rock band Warhol was the manager of The Velvet Underground from 1966 to 1967, before they had achieved widespread recognition or even released an album. Interested in all forms of media, managing a band was Warhol’s way of branching into the music scene, and he injected much of his own creativity into the group, according to Marston. “[A Velvet Underground concert] was this multimedia phenomenon called ‘The Exploding Plastic Inevitable,’ where you got the band performing on stage and several different films by Warhol being projected onto the walls, as well as psychedelic patterns,” Marston said. “Warhol’s friends and assistants would be these ‘backup dancers’ grinding and cracking whips.” Warhol also designed the iconic cover of The Velvet Underground’s debut album, which features a yellow banana as a sticker that could be peeled off to reveal a hot pink banana underneath. 4. His parents were impoverished Eastern European immigrants By the end of the 1950s, Warhol had won almost every graphic design award in advertising and was earning $70,000 a year, a healthy amount even by today’s standards, Marston said. His childhood, however, was much less fortunate. Warhol’s CarpathoRusyn parents immigrated to the United States in 1914 from the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe. Born Andrew Warhola in a shack in the Pittsburgh Hill District, Warhol lived in small homes without plumbing before eventually moving to Dawson Street in South Oakland where he shared a room with his two brothers. Despite the poverty the family endured during the Great Depression, Warhol’s mother Julia encouraged his artistic interests. An artist herself, Julia knew that Warhol couldn’t follow a path of manual labor due to a childhood sickness of St. Vitus dance. Though she encouraged all of her children to create, Warhol had an obvious talent. “They wanted to make sure that he got an education, and that’s why he was the only one of the three brothers to go to college. They thought that he would become an art teacher,” Marston said. “Growing up dirt poor in this really desolate rural village and then coming to PIttsburgh, their aspirations were not quite as high as a doctor or lawyer.” Warhol ultimately attended Carnegie Tech as a pictorial design major, according to Marston, where he developed the style that would make him one of the 20th century’s most influential artists.

PN_HD06," Pitt to host 51st annual jazz seminar honoring Pittsburgh pianist Erroll Garner By Jessica McKenzie, Senior Staff Writer Orrin Evans can’t remember a time when he wasn’t making music on the piano. The Philadelphiabased professional jazz pianist said if someone is meant to be a musician, the career chooses them. “I don’t think you can necessarily pursue a career in the arts,” Evans said. “I think whatever the art form is, it finds you and gives itself to you. I wasn’t seeking a career as a jazz musician, but it came to me.” Evans is one of the featured musicians during Pitt’s 51st annual jazz seminar and concert running from Jan. 24 to 29. The seminar celebrates the legacy of Erroll Garner, an Image courtesy of Jimmy Katz accomplished jazz pianist native to Pittsburgh who died in Orrin Evans, one of the featured musicians during Pitt’s 51st annual jazz 1977. He would have been 100 years old last year. Pitt seminar and concert running from Jan. 24 to 29. delayed the celebration in 2021 due to the COVID19 pandemic. This year, all events will be streamed live on YouTube. The seminar will include several performances throughout the week, an episode of the “Jazz Talk” podcast discussing the University’s Erroll Garner archive which the University curated in 2015 after the death of his longtime manager, Martha Glaser, in December 2014 on Wednesday and a musicians’ rights panel on Thursday. Evans will be part of performances throughout the week tributing to Garner’s compositions, as well as the Jazz Talk episode and musicians’ rights panel. He said he is most excited for the seminar because it will give him the chance to connect with other musicians. “I’m excited to be making music with new people. I know the musicians I’m playing with, just because we know each other from the musical world, but I don’t get a chance to play with them often,” Evans said. “I’m always excited when new people get together and create music. It’s always a special time for me.” Evans is scheduled for a collaborative performance on Saturday evening with bassist Jeff Grubbs, drummer James Johnson III and flutist Nicole Mitchell Gantt — who is director of Pitt’s jazz studies program. Evans said he is looking forward to performing music from Garner’s discography, especially pieces from Garner’s record, “Concert By the Sea.” “‘Concert By the Sea’ was one of the first records I ever purchased. My father used to listen to it a lot,” Evans said. “Erroll Garner’s approach to music and his piano playing was definitely a part of my upbringing and my introduction into music in general.” Irene Monteverde, a pianist and jazz graduate student who is pursuing her doctorate at Pitt, was drawn to the jazz studies program because of Pittsburgh’s rich jazz history, especially in the Hill District. Her doctorate is concentrated on studying Garner’s legacy within the University’s archive. Monteverde participated in the kickoff performance on Monday. She will also be a guest on the Jazz Talk episode on Wednesday, as well as a featured keynote speaker after the panel on Thursday. She said she chose to study Garner because she has always been drawn to his music. "", ""“I just really love his music. I could listen to him forever and not get sick of it. When an artist really captures you and amazes you, it’s kind of a no brainer,” Monteverde said. “His music just has a light, bouncy quality that makes people feel happy. It’s the big, joyous sound that’s rooted in Black music and Black culture.” According to Monteverde, Pitt’s Garner archive includes documents beyond his music. It also features old concert advertisements, legal documents, Garner’s old tape cassettes as well as his personal sketches. “The archive has some of Garner’s doodles, but they’re way better than I could ever do. These are things that he was meditating on,” Monteverde said. “One of them is a coollooking bird with a music note as a face. It’s got all these pastel colored pencils. It’s amazing to see inside his incredible imagination.” Gantt, the founder of the Jazz Talk podcast, said she is thrilled to pay tribute to Garner by playing his compositions this week. “Erroll Garner is one of jazz history’s great virtuosos. He was such an incredible talent he’s from Pittsburgh, but he’s known all over the world,” Gantt said. “No one has been able to really replace his style, his rhythmic agility, his melodic infectiousness or his incredible velocity as a player.” Michael Heller, an associate professor in Pitt’s jazz studies program, will be a panelist during Thursday evening’s event. He said he always viewed Garner as a brilliant performer because of his elaborate techniques. “Garner was one of the most mindbogglingly brilliant individuals of the last 100 years. Listening to him, I hear this unbelievable stream of inventiveness of variation in what he plays and just the perfection of his technique,” Heller said. “Pittsburgh has been the home city of some incredible pianists in jazz.” Besides Garner, Pittsburgh was also home to jazz musicians Earl “Fatha” Hines and Mary Lou Williams. Heller said Garner’s legacy expands beyond his immaculate musical talent. He was also a passionate advocate for musicians’ rights to own their music, which he will discuss during Thursday night’s panel. “Garner was deeply connected to and invested in social progress and social movements of the time, particularly on behalf of Black artists and Black Americans,” Heller said. “It’s something that still hasn’t been covered enough in Garner scholarship, and we’re really working through the archive and through the Garner foundation to reestablish that legacy.” Evans said he hopes that by paying tribute to Garner’s compositions, he inspires students in one way or another. “Everyone I met in my career inspired me in some kind of way, and that’s pretty much what I hope to do for the students,” Evans said. “I hope they walk away hungry and full of desire to pursue or figure out what they’re passionate about.” "" )",Hill District,art,2020-2025
PN_HD07," Ed Gainey elected Pittsburgh’s first Black mayor in landslide election By Natalie Frank, News Editor Ed Gainey, a progressive Democrat, will become the first Black mayor in Pittsburgh’s history after winning the general election in a landslide on Tuesday. Gainey — who represents the 24th State House district, which includes parts of the City’s East End neighborhoods — defeated Republican nominee Tony Moreno, a former Pittsburgh police officer. The Associated Press called the race at about 10:45 p.m. As of Wednesday at 1 a.m., Gainey led by more than 28,000 votes. He had about 70% of the vote compared to Moreno’s 29%. Inperson voting ran from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m and the county Clare Sheedy | Assistant Visual Editor elections office received all mailin ballots by Tuesday at 8 State Rep. Ed Gainey announces his win in the Pittsburgh mayoral race on p.m. Tuesday night at the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts. Gainey said at his election watch party event, which took place at the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts in Downtown, that he reached the mayor’s office with the help of his faith, as well as the support of the Pittsburgh community and his family — his wife, two daughters, son, mother and father. He especially credited his mother, who supported him as a single mother. “Of how to overcome obstacles in life, so that we don’t grow old, but we grow up,” Gainey said. “And in growing up, you make the types of changes that you want to see. I wouldn’t be present without my mother.” Gainey has served in his role in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2013, and won the Democratic nomination for mayor in the May primary, defeating incumbent Bill Peduto. Moreno accepted the Republican nomination after coming in third in the Democratic primary. Gainey thanked Moreno first for a “spirited general election” and said he wishes him and his family the best. Moreno spoke to supporters at Station Square and said the “togetherness” he focused his campaign around will still be represented in Gainey’s time in office. “Now, let’s get together and go forward in the future, Pittsburgh,” Moreno said. “Let’s cure these party problems. Let’s clear out the corruption. Let’s make sure that we’re all together. Let’s make sure that we don’t fight like this anymore.” At the Gainey party, hundreds of Pittsburghers cheered in excitement and gathered around the mayorelect. He highlighted his Pittsburgh roots, with his family being from the Hill District, him growing up on Lawn Street in South Oakland and then moving to East Liberty. Gainey — whose priorities include criminal justice reform, neighborhood and housing accessibility, environmental sustainability and youth representation in government — said he hopes the community can work together to create the “safest city in America.” Also championing affordable housing initiatives, Gainey said he will work to ensure working class families aren’t pushed or forced out of their neighborhoods, and that Pittsburgh is a diverse city that is accessible and provides opportunity for all. “We can have a City where our neighborhood lots are manicured and clean, where our kids don’t have to walk to school and see negativity, but walk to school and see clean positivity so when they get to the classroom, their mind can learn,” Gainey said. “‘We,’ ‘We,’ I didn’t say ‘I,’ I said we can do that.” "", ""Gainey’s plans also include “demilitarizing” the police force and shifting those investments to new training and deescalation strategies. He said at the event that he will work to ensure the relationship between police and residents doesn’t “divide, but unifies and multiplies.” State Rep. Dan Frankel, D23, said he is especially grateful for Gainey’s work in his neighboring 24th district. He said they have worked together to “put together a package of bills” that update Pennsylvania’s hate crime laws after the Tree of Life massacre, and he is eager to see what Gainey does in office in terms of affordable housing legislation, critical justice reform and more. “We’re totally in sync, in terms of the issues that are facing the City,” Frankel said. “You know, I want to work with him to make sure that we provide him all the score we can in Harrisburg.” Frankel said the historic election of Gainey as Pittsburgh’s first Black mayor is “an incredible moment.” “I think it gives me hope for our City that an African American, who has been working in government for so many years, can bring his talents and the City recognizes it, even though the majority of the City is white,” Frankel said. “So that’s a great thing for Pittsburgh.” In his speech, Gainey emphasized the importance of setting an example for children growing up in Pittsburgh. He said he wants to ensure “our children” see and get to experience the major changes Gainey and the greater Pittsburgh community wants to make for safety, the education system, diversity and more. “Look at the image that we are showing our children,” Gainey said. “I want our children to see what a city for all looks like. I want our children to see why our City is safe and we work so hard. I want our children to see why we have a worldclass education system. I want our children to see the diversity that is the new America.” Angel Gober, regional director of OnePA, said her organization has been campaigning for Gainey. Gober said OnePA “really hit the ground hard for Ed Gainey” and increased voter turnout for this election. “He’s very aligned with our issues. He’s been in our organization for a very long time, specifically around education, justice and ending the school to prison pipeline,” Gober said. “So it was an easy decision to support him as the next mayor.” Gober said she is especially excited to see how Gainey focuses on funding the Pittsburgh education system, addressing environmental issues and increasing political engagement once in office. Morgan Overton, president of Young Democrats of Allegheny County, said her organization works to elect Democratic candidates yearround. Overton, who also serves as the vice chair of the Gender Equity Commission, referenced the commission’s 2019 report that revealed that Pittsburgh is a difficult place to live in for Black women and said she hopes Gainey prioritizes the “livelihoods of Black women in Pittsburgh.” “So I hope that he listens to Black women, I hope that he has Black women as part of his administration,” Overton, a Pitt 2016 and 2020 alumna, said. “And I want this to turn into a city where people don’t think that they have to leave in order to thrive.” Jessie Ramey, director of the Women’s Institute at Chatham University, echoed Overton’s sentiments regarding gender equity. Ramey said she trusts that Gainey will prioritize Black women and the community will work with him to ensure that. “I think if we lead with intersectional, justice work, that we can’t go wrong, right?” Ramey said. “So if we really put intersectionality and put Black women at the center of everything we do in Pittsburgh, and really think about who is really the most marginalized in our City and put them right in the middle of every decision we make, we will not go wrong.” The crowd chanted “One City,” in celebration of Gainey’s victory. Gainey said everyone can be innovators and work toward change in Pittsburgh, and hopes to partner with the community to facilitate that change. Gainey said when Pittsburgh shows up, “we blow up.” “But here’s the reality,” Gainey said. “That doesn’t start with me, because here’s why: if one man tells you they can change the city, then they’re not telling you the truth. If we partner together, if we build a city that we want to see, that’s called buyin. Buyin as a return for our investment that we create a city where everybody feels welcome and when we do that, we win as a people.” "" )",Hill District,politics/activism,2020-2025
PN_HD08," ‘Art for August’ traveling art exhibit celebrates playwright’s legacy By Maria Scanga, Staff Writer Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson may have passed away in 2005, but the Hill District native left a strong legacy — which the “Art for August” traveling exhibit is helping keep alive. Initiated by the August Wilson House, an organization dedicated to celebrating Wilson’s legacy and transforming his childhood home, the art exhibit invites the community to participate in this celebration. The artwork featured in the exhibit boasts the work of artists from a variety of ages, from young collegeaged students to older artists. Their pieces also vary in medium, often in direct Aaiush Jain | Staff Photographer relation to the material and images of Wilson’s plays. Visitors In partnership with the August Wilson House, the University Library System could see a physical dress as well as portraits, paintings and at Pitt’s Hillman Library is the first stop of an exhibit showcasing new and drawings. original artwork created by ten local Pittsburgh artists. Wilson wrote plays that have reached audiences far beyond the Pittsburgh area. Some of Wilson’s best known works, such as “Fences” and “The Piano Lesson,” have even been made into films. “Fences” stars Alist performers Denzel Washington and Viola Davis as the lead roles. The exhibit debuted in April at the Energy Innovation Center, a learning center in Downtown. It then came to Pitt, and will travel through other parts of the City. While at Pitt, the exhibit showcased new and original artwork created by 10 local Pittsburgh artists. Kornelia Tancheva, the director of Pitt’s University Library System, said the library system is proud to have been the first stop for the “Art for August” exhibit. “It is one of the events celebrating our acquisition of the August Wilson Archive, which will be officially opened to the public in January 2023,” Tancheva said. The exhibit was open from Sept. 15 to Oct. 31 to all Pitt students, staff and faculty to visit at any time while the library was open. It has now moved on from Pitt and will be displayed at nearby Carnegie Mellon University from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15. The August Wilson House, in conjunction with the “Art for August” traveling exhibit, is also restoring Wilson’s childhood home, which is vacant in the Hill District. According to Ed Galloway, the associate University librarian for archives and special collections, the home is marked by a historical marker despite its disheveled appearance. “The August Wilson House is primarily there to receive the funds to restore the house, and then expand the programming of the house around artists, to attract artists to come and use the house as a place of inspiration and study,” Galloway said. The restoration process will result in a fully functional house for local artists and creators, rather than serve as a museum about Wilson’s life. Galloway said the August Wilson Archive, which is a collection of physical materials from Wilson’s life, has been obtained by Pitt Archives & Special Collections. It will serve as the hub for people to see and work with Wilson’s past, and the “Art for August” exhibit acted as a precursor to the opening of the archive and the archive’s goals. “We really hope that when we open the collection, not just for Pitt students but also with the community of the Hill District, in particular, they’ll be able to continue to do that kind of creative work based on what they’re finding in the collection itself,” Galloway said. "", ""Jeff Wisniewski, a ULS spokesperson, said bringing the artwork to Hillman is really helpful for fostering conversations about Wilson and the broader issues within Black performing arts. “We are enthusiastic about partnering with local arts organizations to help foster conversations around August and his works,” Wisniewski said. “More specifically, issues of equity, diversity and inclusion.” Galloway said the artwork in the collection is the product of these local artists’ appreciation for Wilson’s own creative work, specifically his plays. He added that a lot of these artists drew inspiration from his life and legacy as well. “All these artists have the love of August Wilson, a love of the Hill District and a love of his plays,” Galloway said. “They are inspired in some way by him to spur this creativity.” One work of art in particular is a painting which features Wilson in the center with images surrounding him. The images showcase different parts of the history and culture for Black people in 20th century Pittsburgh, such as a time when taxis could not drive through the Hill District at all. This is in reference to his series of 10 plays, called “The Pittsburgh Cycle,” which chronicled life for a Black person in Pittsburgh from each decade of the 20th century. For Wisniewski, the variety of the artwork stood out to him, but he added that the artwork must be seen in person to truly appreciate the different mediums the artists used. “I’m a fan of the artists’ use of mixed media, which I think you can best appreciate in person,” Wisniewski said. Tancheva said bringing the exhibit to and featuring it at Pitt connects closely to the library’s focus on preserving and celebrating the lives of Pittsburgh locals. “It connects closely to our focus on preserving and celebrating the life, work and legacy of August Wilson,” Tancheva said. “It gives us the chance to also celebrate the artistic heritage of local Pittsburgh communities.” "" )",Hill District,art,2020-2025
PN_HD09," ‘You’ve got to be personable’: Pitt students canvass for Gainey across Pittsburgh By Alexandra Ross, Staff Writer The last thing Will Allison expected to hear when he knocked on a potential voter’s door this month was a bird squawking — but sure enough, when the resident opened his door, he had two parrots perched on his arm. “We were like, ‘Oh, hi, we’re canvassing for Ed Gainey for mayor.’ And he’s like, ‘Oh, I like Ed Gainey, you want to hold the parrots?’” Allison, a sophomore political science major, said. Joining Allison in Bloomfield that day was junior political science and English literature double major Isabella Veneris, who said one of the birds’ names was Ziggy Featherdust. The two Pitt students work as fellows on progressive Democrat Romita Das | Senior Staff Photographer Ed Gainey’s mayoral campaign team, where they do phone Isabella Veneris is a junior political science and English literature double banking, create social media posts, help organize events and major, as well as a fellow on Ed Gainey’s mayoral campaign team. canvass doortodoor. Image courtesy of Isabella Veneris "", ""Tony Moreno, Gainey’s Republican opponent in the Nov. 2 general election, said he does not currently have any Pitt student volunteers on his staff, though he said his campaign has student volunteers from Robert Morris and Duquesne universities. While campaign workers canvass for the purpose of convincing potential supporters to come out and vote for their candidate, Reiss Veltri, a junior political science major who is also a fellow, said the goal isn’t to attack or debate an individual voter’s political views. “I think people come with that conception, when they’re working a campaign — ‘I’m gonna be arguing with people’ — it’s really not that way,” Veltri said. “It’s really like, you’ve got to make connections with people, you’ve got to be personable.” Veltri and Allison both said they got involved with Gainey’s campaign before the May 18 primary election — working as unpaid fellows before it became a paid position at $15 an hour. Veneris said Allison recruited her to join the team in early September. As a political science student, Veltri said he had been looking for opportunities to get more involved with local politics before he joined the Gainey campaign. He said he has enjoyed the work he’s done with the campaign and hopes to continue with others in the future. “I would love to work on other campaigns,” Veltri said. “It’s so cool. I’d love to slowly climb the ladder of campaign staffing and figure out what it is and try to make a difference individually.” Veneris, who works as a barista at a local Starbucks besides completing her coursework, said she doesn’t have any trouble finding the time for the fellow position. She said she must work at least 10 hours each week, and she is able to fit them into her schedule without issues. “I do think this position is really flexible,” Veneris said. “It allows me to work whenever I’m able to get away from school, and it doesn’t impede on my ability to actually go through my assignments and do any work.” Sharing the same political stances and values as Gainey — such as supporting unions and challenging UPMC’s taxexempt status — makes it easier to talk about his platform passionately, Veneris said. She said those who wish to work on a political campaign should take the time to find a candidate they truly believe in. “I would say if you would love to get involved in a political campaign, make sure you really care about the issues and make sure you pick a candidate that you think represents you and your values,” Veneris said. Allison said the Gainey campaign staff has an equal and freeflowing exchange of ideas, and more experienced staff members encourage student workers to contribute meaningfully to the campaign. “People from above are very willing to listen to ideas from people below,” Allison said. “For example, if I have an idea, I feel very open to suggest it to … the field organizer. And she’s very willing to consider or put into place an idea that one of the interns [fellows] has had.” Veltri said he volunteered for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign for two weeks last fall. Compared to a national campaign, he said there is more personal connection, but fewer resources and less structure in a local mayoral campaign. “I never got to meet Biden in person — I get to meet Gainey every once in a while,” Veltri said. “They were really concise with how we were getting things together and stuff. For our campaign, a lot of people are newer and stuff, and so we’re still feeling out the correct methods and stuff with organizing … we don’t get as many volunteers, so we have to make do with what we have.” Canvassing in Pittsburgh means connecting with people from communities that have been neglected by the City government, according to Allison. He said it was heartbreaking to see the way the City had treated predominantly Black communities such as the Hill District, Homewood, CaliforniaKirkbride and MarshallShadeland. “I’ll go into places and you’ll see half the homes are vacant, or you’ll see these buildings that were condemned 20 years ago and nothing has been done with them,” Allison said. “I mean, that’s criminal. Like it’s, it’s seriously, it’s criminal.” Veltri said engaging facetoface with Pittsburgh residents through the campaign has helped him learn more about the City’s demographics and the impact of various political issues. He said it gives him perspective on how politics play out in the real world. “People are really individually affected by these issues,” Veltri said. “It’s really cool to see people either appreciating what you’re doing, or people who are seeing the negative effects of what you’re doing, which is just as important.” "" )",Hill District,displacement/gentrification,2020-2025

Dickinson, a professor in Pitt’s School of Law and candidate for a local U.S. House seat, said he can’t watch any more of the video because of his own experience with the Pittsburgh police. He said 10 years ago, a police officer threw him to the ground “for being Black.” “I was thrown to the ground by a police officer — Pittsburgh police.

He said “today is the day of change” but “tomorrow is a new day,” and the only way to change the City, the nation and the world for the better is “power to the people.” “It can’t be over until we have equal laws for everybody where no African American feels like he’s going to be killed just because he gets pulled over by the police,” Gainey said. “We can never, ever go back to settle for over policing in our neighborhoods knowing that the only one going to jail is us.” .@RepGainey, who is running a primary challenge against Mayor Bill Peduto, said “we can never ever go back to settle for over policing in our neighborhoods, knowing that the only one going to jail is us.” pic.twitter.com/Ob6ZHHSjhO — The Pitt News (@ThePittNews) April 20, 2021 Raymond Robinson, a magisterial judge candidate, added that he encourages people to “take to the streets” to change flawed systems and to vote for candidates seeking meaningful change.

PN_HD13," Pharmacy students deliver COVID19 vaccines to Homewood, Hill District residents By Punya Bhasin, Staff Writer For Black pharmacy students like Nnenna Anyanwu, the chance to help underserved and predominantly Black communities in the Pittsburgh area by administering COVID19 vaccines was something that hit close to home. “Having lived in Pittsburgh for a while, I know that the Homewood and Hill District are predominantly underserved and Black population, so I was really happy to go out there and help out because there’s not that many Black people in health care, and I know that a lot of Black people are concerned about the medical field and the COVID vaccine, because they don’t know who to trust,” Anyanwu said. “I was really glad to be a part of the pharmacy school initiative and be a source of representation for the Black community.” Pitt’s School of Pharmacy took secondyear students to the Hill District and Homewood to administer over 1,000 COVID19 vaccines to senior citizens on Feb. 5 and Feb. 6. The Allegheny County Health Department set up two vaccination sites with 60 pharmacy students each administering the Moderna vaccine to people ages 65 and older. This initiative was part of the School’s goal to help underserved neighborhoods and better exemplify to their students what equitable health care should be, as outlined by the new Pledge of Professionalism oath written this year. Photo courtesy of Chandrima Saha Travis Van Otterloo, a secondyear pharmacy student, said he was excited when he heard that he would be able to help Chandrima Saha and a few pharmacy school peers administered COVID19 vaccination efforts and thought it was a great idea to help out vaccines to senior citizens on Feb. 5 and Feb. 6. the community. “My emotions were all over the board. I was definitely excited,” Van Otterloo said. “I thought that it was going to be a fantastic experience for me, but also something great for the community that we were able to aid in, and there’s no doubt in my mind that every single patient that walked out of each of those clinics that day were extremely happy.” Van Otterloo said he was impressed with the way that the pharmacy school has been handling this new way of education through the pandemic and is grateful for the handson learning. “I think they’re handling it incredibly well,” Van Otterloo said. “I mean of course there’s gonna be some bumps in the road and everything, especially during a pandemic there’s so many things that are out of your hands, but they laid out the complete list of things we needed to do to be certified to vaccinate patients and the planning for this has been impeccable.” Van Otterloo, who was volunteering on Feb. 5 said the patients who received the vaccines heard about the event through word of mouth. "", ""“When we first got there, we were told that in the Homewood district, this was not a thing that was advertised. When you go to nursing homes and things like that, these things are going to be advertised and certain dates and times will be set up,” Van Otterloo said. “That’s not the same in underprivileged areas where this event was spread by word of mouth from person to person, so it truly was a communityled event, which is significantly different from any other mass vaccination upwards like that.” Anyanwu said being one of the few Black health professionals that day, she realized how necessary it was to have proper representation and diversity within the healthcare industry when some patients of color asked for her opinion on what medical practices they should trust. “I had this one, an older Black gentleman came up to me and expressed his grievances with the COVID vaccine because he didn’t know whether or not to get it, so he asked me personally because I was the only Black staff member in the pharmacy at the time,” Anyanwu said. “He said that he would have felt more relief if he saw more Black pharmacy students, more Black pharmacists and more Black people in health care.” Chandrima Saha — a secondyear pharmacy student who vaccinated approximately 30 patients in Homewood on Feb. 5 — said this experience felt like she was making history. “I think that the whole experience is unreal because first of all, like we have been doing school online so being able to be just as present in something like this feels like we’re making history,” Saha said. Having participated in this clinic, Anyanwu also said the initiative is the first step to providing better representation and equality within the health care field, and she hopes the University will continue with these efforts. “I think we should continue helping underserved areas because everyone deserves equal opportunity to health care, especially with the COVID vaccine distributions,” Anyanwu said. “It’s important for people to get equal access to health care, and just making sure that it is available for them.” Anyanwu said the experience made her feel part of a bigger movement, and like she was making a difference in the lives of patients. “I felt like I was actually going out and personally making a difference in someone’s life since this was definitely more personal because I could see the patient’s reaction, I could see their gratitude, I could see how grateful they were,” Anyanwu said. “I felt like I was doing something big and if I look back I can say confidently in the future that I definitely helped them.” "" )",Hill District,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025
PN_HD14," Column | Pitt boasts decorated Mount Rushmore of hometown heroes By Kyle Saxon, Staff Writer Throughout its decorated athletic history, Pitt has produced numerous phenomenal athletes. The greater Pittsburgh area has also been home to some of the greatest high school athletes of all time. While it is always fulfilling to see former Panther athletes succeed at the professional level, it is perhaps even more special to see homegrown talent shine at Pitt. It is no coincidence that Pitt’s greatest hometown heroes have played for its most highprofile programs. The following is the “Mount Rushmore” of athletes who are not only Panther greats, but also Pittsburgh natives. TPN file photo Tony Dorsett (Aliquippa) Tony Dorsett walks onto Heinz Field with Pitt Football in 2016. The most decorated athlete to ever wear the blue and gold is a clearcut choice for any list of Pitt’s greatest athletes. Dorsett grew up in Aliquippa and attended Hopewell High School, where he stood out as one of the best running backs in the country. As a firstyear, he exploded onto the scene at Pitt, setting the firstyear rushing record with 1,686 yards in 1973. And just three games into his sophomore season — his 15th overall collegiate game — Dorsett broke the school’s alltime rushing record. While his first three years at Pitt would have been enough to cement him as the greatest running back in school history, Dorsett’s senior season solidified him as perhaps the greatest college running back ever. In 1976, he rushed for 2,150 yards and 22 touchdowns, winning the Heisman Trophy and leading Pitt to a national championship. Quite frankly, it is borderline impossible to have a more impressive season than Dorsett had as a senior at Pitt. The college and professional Hall of Famer will forever be considered one of the greatest athletes to ever hail from the City of Pittsburgh and to ever wear a Pitt Panther uniform. Dan Marino (Pittsburgh) The term “hometown hero” may not even accurately encapsulate what Dan Marino means to Pitt. Marino grew up in South Oakland, a neighborhood many current Pitt students call home. He was a high school standout at Central Catholic, just a few blocks down Fifth Avenue from Pitt’s campus. He played at Pitt from 197982, and while he does not have a national championship to show for it, he played on some of the greatest Pitt teams of all time. Behind an offensive line featuring Russ Grimm and Mark May, and with the help of a defense headlined by Hugh Green and Rickey Jackson, Marino was the signalcaller for an astounding collection of talent. He was great in his first two seasons, but due to inconsistent playing time because of injuries, Marino’s statistics from his firstyear and sophomore seasons are not exceptional. But his junior season was absolutely unforgettable. The gunslinger threw for 2,876 yards, 37 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. Marino had emerged as a top NFL prospect but decided to stay at Pitt for his senior season. His struggles in his fourth season caused him to fall in the NFL draft, but his Hall of Fame professional career has teams who passed on him still losing sleep. Marino is one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play football, and certainly one of the greatest athletes to ever play at Pitt. "", ""DeJuan Blair (Pittsburgh) Despite spending just two years at Pitt, DeJuan Blair left a legacy large enough to solidify himself as a Panther legend. Blair grew up in the Hill District and attended Schenley High School, a short ride from the Petersen Events Center. He joined Jamie Dixon’s team at an opportune time, as Pitt had been on the cusp of greatness for years before Blair’s arrival. His talent was enough to make Pitt one of the most feared teams in the country. As a firstyear, Blair averaged 11.6 points and 9.1 rebounds in 26 minutes per game, earning him Freshman AllAmerica and Big East Rookie of the Year honors while also leading Pitt to a Big East tournament championship. In Blair’s sophomore season, he led the best team in program history to a 315 record, a season that included Pitt’s first No. 1 overall national ranking in school history and an Elite Eight appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Blair averaged 15.7 points and a nationalbest 12.3 rebounds per game. He earned Big East player of the year, as well as Consensus AllAmerica honors. Blair’s time at Pitt may have been relatively short, but it was enough to establish himself as the greatest Pitt basketball player of all time. Mike Ditka (Aliquippa) Mike Ditka, simply put, is an icon of the sports world. While he is on this list for his contributions to Pitt, he is much more widely beloved for his contributions to the sport of football as a whole. Ditka attended Aliquippa High School and spent three years at Pitt. His receiving stats appear to be lackluster, but this is simply because of how the game was played when Ditka attended Pitt from 195860, where he played tight end and defensive line. While he only accumulated 45 receptions for 730 yards across three seasons — albeit in an era where passing was considered a last resort — Ditka led the team in receiving all three seasons. He was a feared blocking tight end as well, and finished sixth in Heisman voting his junior season despite accumulating just 11 receptions on the season, also earning AllAmerica honors. His talent with the ball in his hands was evident in his limited opportunities, as he averaged 16.2 yards per reception in his career, and was selected fifth overall in the NFL draft by the Chicago Bears. Ditka is a college Hall of Famer, but he is best known for his Hall of Fame career as a professional player and coach. He won the NFL championship with the Bears in 1963 and coached them to a Super Bowl victory in 1985, as well. "" )",Hill District,sports,2020-2025

The festival opens virtually Thursday with “Monsoon,” starring Henry Golding from “Crazy Rich Asians,” and continues until Oct. 17. The festival will also feature the renowned 1985 film “Desert Hearts” as well as contemporary films, including “Rehabilitation of the Hill” and “Breaking Fast.” Rich Cummings founded the festival in 1985 to provide a Photo coutesy of TJ Murphy platform for LGBTQ+ films that were excluded from The ReelQ LGBTQ+ film festival opens virtually Thursday with “Monsoon,” mainstream media. Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the starring Henry Golding from “Crazy Rich Asians.” festival is online this year, but it will have a drivein movie screening on Oct. 17. Viewers can buy fullaccess festival passes or purchase tickets for individual films, with discounts available to students. Similar to an inperson film festival, the features are only available for a limited time, and audience members are encouraged to vote for their favorite film. TJ Murphy, the executive director of the film festival, said ReelQ wanted to host an online event after collaborating virtually with City of Asylum in May. “This is our most accessible festival yet,” Murphy said. “There’s a chat feature involved in our online platform, where the audience can talk during the film to each other.” Murphy said he values the sense of community in film. He also said that audiences should feel comfortable discussing the films and engaging in unfamiliar storylines. “Movies have the power to bring everyone together in a really strong way,” Murphy said. “I hope, in the virtual world this year, that people are still making those connections with each other.” The festival catalog offers dozens of narrative features, documentaries and shorts. Murphy recommends “Alice Junior,” a Brazilian film about a trans teenage YouTuber. “It’s a really, really fantastic film. It’s incredibly heartfelt,” Murphy said. “I’m really excited about it. It’s definitely one of my favorite films that has come out these last few years.” Although the festival showcases several foreign films, “Rehabilitation of the Hill,” the narrative feature available Friday, hits close to home. The film tells the story of two young women, Kelly and Gwen, working to restore Pittsburgh’s Hill District neighborhood. Even though Kelly and Gwen have conflicting plans for the future of the Hill, their dedication and passion for the neighborhood eventually evolves into romance. The film, shot in Pittsburgh, explores the impacts of gentrification and discrimination in the historically Black part of the City. The film’s director and screenwriter, Demetrius Wren, said his decision to use the Hill District as the film’s setting was inspired by his personal connection to the community. "", ""“My fatherinlaw’s office is in the Hill District. He works for the Pittsburgh Promise. Their office is next to what used to be the Hill House,” Wren said. “That’s where I first felt the idea about writing it in the Hill District. There’s so much history in that neighborhood, and also the current state of the neighborhood.” Wren also emphasized the importance of sharing the Hill District’s story, often an overlooked chapter of Pittsburgh history. In the mid1900s, the neighborhood was one of the country’s most influential and popular centers for art and jazz. The neighborhood experienced an economic decline in the 1950s after thousands of buildings were torn down during the construction of the Civic Arena. “When we think about rehabilitating neighborhoods, we think we’re just going to pour resources into buying and building nice things, but it doesn’t actually help the individuals who are there — it just displaces them,” Wren said. “What people really need is resources, equity.” Wren said he took a broader, multilayered approach to the film to recognize the value of communal success stories. For this reason, the film focuses on the neighborhood as a whole, rather than a single character arc. “Usually, in films like this — and I’m talking about mainstream Hollywood films — there might be an individual who makes it out,” Wren said. “Very rarely do we talk about an entire community coming up together.” According to Wren, Pitt’s Film and Media Studies department helped fund the film, under one condition — that Wren try his best to incorporate Pittsburgh talent. As a result, Wren said he was able to work with Pitt students and hire local cast and crew members. Christina Wren, Wren’s wife and coproducer who also stars as Kelly, expressed that working on the film felt like a communal effort, and that this spirit is reflected in the film. “It was a joyful thing every day. There was a builtin mentorship program. We had people who had taken workshops with Demetrius in the Hill District coming in and participating with the crew,” she said. “It really felt like a celebration every day, like we were in some ways living the story of the film.” The ReelQ Film Festival is also screening the narrative feature “Breaking Fast,” a selfdescribed “queer romcom about an Arab Muslim and an allAmerican jock.” The film takes place during the month of Ramadan and follows the life of Mo, a gay Muslim man living in California. According to Mike Mosallam, the film’s director and writer, “Breaking Fast” started off as a short film until he decided to continue the story with producer Seth Hauer. “We didn’t set out to make a feature. After the short received the reception that it did in the festival community, we started to imagine what expanding the world would look like,” Mosallam said. “I feel like almost every step of this process has been a real organic one.” Religion and sexual identity are central to the plot of “Breaking Fast.” Even though Mo and Kal, the “allAmerican jock,” come from different backgrounds, the two bond over breaking fast together during Ramadan. Mosallam said he wanted to show how Mo’s identity as a Muslim and a gay man can exist in harmony. “We are taught by society that those things should be at odds,” Mosallam said. “I think if we can cancel out the noise, and just have sort of an individualized relationship with our faith, we can live in the duality, and the intersection, as comfortably as we choose.” Hauer said he and Mosallam wanted the film to be a space where viewers could connect with the characters and see their own identities portrayed on the screen. “That’s really what made me want to work in film — to tell more stories like that for people who don’t see themselves represented in their immediate community, or don’t see themselves represented on screen, and feel a little less alone,” Hauer said. Hauer said one of his goals for the film was to prove that people have more in common than they may think. He also pointed out that the romcom genre is all about reconciling differences — two seemingly incompatible characters meeting and falling in love. “Even if people look different from us, we’re all human and we all want the same or similar things,” Hauer said. “That was our whole goal in doing this as a romantic comedy. It’s about people who are, in theory, so different, until they realize they’re not.” The film also features something a lot of LGBTQ+ stories don’t get — a happy ending. Mosallam said filmmakers should feel comfortable telling positive LGBTQ+ stories, not just ones that deal with conflict. According to Mosallam, his decision to portray the relationship between Mo and Kal as a romcom reinforces the idea that combining religion and sexuality doesn’t have to be a struggle — it can also be a triumph. “What I want people to understand is that no matter who we love, the themes of love, how we love, how we allow ourselves love, how we reject love — those themes are universal,” Mosallam said.

PN_HD16," Pitt student group could lose community garden by April By Sarah Berg, Staff Writer 10 to 25 members of the student group Plant 2 Plate gather every Sunday on Oakland Avenue to tend to their urban garden, a plot the size of two homes hosting flower beds and produce like beets, kale, raspberries and strawberries. But after University officials told them plans to build a dorm on their garden space are likely beginning earlier than originally planned, members are uncertain about the future of their garden. The Plant 2 Plate club, which primarily donates the produce they grow to the Pitt Pantry, has met at their plot of land across from Bouquet Gardens once a week nearly every year since its establishment a decade ago by students in the Thomas Yang | Assistant Visual Editor Honors College. Several plots within the garden are rented The Plant2Plate garden, which has been used for more than a decade, will out to South Oakland residents and the weekly gardening be paved over and relocated as soon as the end of this semester due to sessions are open to all, not just Pitt students. Members had campus changes outlined in the Institutional Master Plan. known the University Institutional Master Plan, which includes a student housing development on the site of the garden as well as adjacent properties, would displace them and have been working with the University since October to find a new location. Joseph Jaros, president of Plant 2 Plate, said they were originally told by Pitt that the club would have until the end of 2020 to vacate the space. But at a meeting on Jan. 10 with Aurora Sharrard, Pitt’s sustainability director, Nick Goodfellow, sustainability coordinator for auxiliary services, and Mary Beth McGrew, the associate vice chancellor for planning, design and real estate, Plant 2 Plate was notified that Pitt may begin construction of the new dorm as soon as this semester if the Institutional Master Plan is approved in March following community feedback. “The schedule for the construction of the new dorm in the current garden space is being accelerated,” Jaros wrote in an email. “This came as a big surprise to us, as we were originally told we would have until the end of 2020 in the current space. This means we will not be able to plant anything in the coming season unless we have a new space.” Members of Plant 2 Plate said they’ve felt they have been left out of the loop regarding Pitt’s proposal to build on their property, having found out their garden would be demolished only after the draft of the campus master plan was released last February. John Jursca, Plant 2 Plate’s vice president, said discovering the impact the proposed housing plans for South Campus would have on the club this way was an issue for him. “We felt like we were kind of left out of that conversation. And then, we started reaching out, making contacts with Pitt admin and people who were involved in that plan, and now we’ve had meetings and we’re scheduling more meetings in the future, but we had to seek that out,” Jursca said. Jaros said insufficient communication between the University and the club could be attributed to a broader lack of engagement between the University and all students. “What was strange to me was that there were already meetings going on beforehand about this space that weren’t including us … I think in general as a student body we’re not made aware of these institutional meetings,” Jaros, a senior linguistics and biology major, said. University spokesperson Kevin Zwick said Pitt has been cooperating and communicating with Plant 2 Plate. "", ""“The University is committed to finding a new location for the garden, as the campus master plan includes redevelopment of this area to support additional campus housing needs,” Zwick wrote in an email. “We are currently exploring options in collaboration with the student group who manages it, in expectation of finding placement solutions to support this campus need.” Jaros and Jursca said Plant 2 Plate’s main priority now is finding a permanent place to move into so they can continue gardening when the time comes to leave the current space. Jursca said pausing the club could be detrimental to its future, with probable loss of interest and membership. “It’s not good to us if they start construction on our [current] plot and they say, ‘In two or three years when we start this construction you guys will have another space over here,’” Jursca said. According to the members, Pitt has asked Plant 2 Plate to suggest new locations to go over in meetings together. Jaros said new location options were discussed at the Friday meeting. “We are now considering two new spaces on upper campus that we would be able to relocate to (ideally this semester). I should know more about this in a few weeks, but there is nothing promised yet,” Jaros wrote. “I am optimistic that one of these [new locations] will work out, and either space would be larger than the one we have now, and could provide good opportunities to engage more with the Hill District communities.” Moving out of a location surrounded by dense student populations and bars could also help avoid vandalism that Jursca said the garden has experienced, such as knocked down fences, stolen flowers and ripped up beds. If the club and Pitt are not able to arrange a successful relocation to a permanent location soon, Jursca said moving into a temporary location, such as using planter boxes near Hillman Library, may be necessary. “I think there’s definitely potential for improvement, but that would have to have a strong commitment from the administration and we’d have to work that out before we get rid of our current space,” Jursca said. Jaros hopes that the University’s focus on sustainability will include supporting the garden. “This could be a really good opportunity for the University to take charge and … show that they’re into these sustainability initiatives that the students have been pushing, so they could really make a change,” he said. “On the other hand, I am worried that we’re going to just keep going through this chain of events and meetings and at the end of the day if we don’t have something, we have no control over the situation.” "" )",Hill District,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025
PN_HD17," People’s Pride celebrates, advocates for Black trans lives By Rebecca Johnson, News Editor Around 50 people donning rainbow attire and flags that said “Give us our roses while we’re still here” marched across Pittsburgh on Sunday as part of People’s Pride. They could be heard chanting “Black trans lives are under attack. What do we do? Stand up, fight back,” to the beat of a drum. This march, postponed from the summer, was part of the threeday “People’s Pride PGH 2020: Black Trans Lives Matter Too” pride festival hosted by SisTersPGH — a local transgender community center. The demonstration focused on advocating for Black trans rights in Pittsburgh and police reforms to better protect the LGBT+ community. Sarah Cutshall | Visual Editor The march started at Freedom Corner in the Hill District, went SisTersPGH hosted a Sunday march from Freedom Corner to Allegheny into Downtown and crossed the 7th Street Bridge, also known Commons Park as part of “People’s Pride PGH 2020: Black Trans Lives as the Andy Warhol Bridge, to the North Side. About 50 Matter Too.” people marched and about a dozen vehicles joined in the front and back. The trucks leading the parade were decorated with quotes from transgender activists Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson and colorful artwork around the theme “our love is ceremony” and “our rage is ceremony.” People’s Pride is the only pride festival in Pittsburgh this year, following the dissolution of the Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh in late August. Delta was known for its annual Pittsburgh Pride celebration in Downtown. Martin Healey, Delta’s board president, said the postponement of Pittsburgh Pride due to the COVID19 pandemic and questions of whether the event could be held in 2021 left the nonprofit with no revenue stream. Delta was involved in a number of controversies during its 24year history. Former board president Gary Van Horn resigned in January after he was arrested on multiple charges, including impersonating emergency responders. The group has also faced sharp criticism from members of the Black transgender community who said the organization wasn’t inclusive of all members of Pittsburgh’s LGBT+ community. Ciora Thomas, the founder and president of SisTersPGH, said Black trans people knew for a long time that Delta was problematic. Black trans rights activists held an August protest on the South Side outside the offices of a company owned by Healey, calling for the foundation to cease operations. “I don’t want to keep speaking their sickening name into existence because we knew what they were doing,” Thomas said. “Black trans people knew what Delta was doing. We told y’all year after year after year and nobody listened.” Thomas added that now is time to move on to a new, better day in Pittsburgh’s pride festivities with People’s Pride. “Delta was some bulls—. We got over that bulls—,” Thomas said. “Now let’s move on to better days, let’s move on to some collective space where we are building community within our community.” Deepshikha Sharma, a 26yearold Bloomfield resident and 2015 Pitt graduate, said it was important for her as a member of the South Asian community to support the Black community at the demonstration. “It was super important for me to come out to support my Black siblings, especially as a South Asian I want to be there in solidarity for this community because they are also my community,” Sharma said. “It’s important that I put my body here in support of everyone.” "", ""Sharma said showing up to events like these is something all students should do, as well. “It’s super important for students who may have more time and resources that people who are working may not,” Sharma said. “When students show up, having the bodies there is a good thing so we can stand in solidarity.” Thomas said many of SisTersPGH’s initiatives focus on nurturing transgender and nonbinary leaders in Pittsburgh. Thomas said she hopes to pass on her leadership to younger people. “We want to empower our youth to lead, our youth to be in spaces that are authentically built for them and they see people who look like them,” Thomas said. “They are our future. I’m ready to continue activating our young trans and nonbinary community members so that I can sit down and rest.” One of these young leaders is Jaqob Harris, a 22yearold Bloomfield resident. Harris said ze hopes the momentum the Black Lives Matter movement got over the summer continues, although incidences of violence and oppression against Black people and transgender people aren’t new. “Black trans people, Black trans women have been oppressed for way too f—ing long, and that’s just a reality of our life. The kind of stuff we’ve seen on the news for the past couple months, isn’t new,” Harris said. “The only difference between then and now is we’ve been locked in our rooms for the last eight months, and we had to see it.” Harris added that while ze thinks People’s Pride was “amazing,” there is still a long way to go to achieve equity in Pittsburgh and the country. “There’s a lot of people around the country who are telling us to sit down, shut up and are trying to put things in place to placate us so we get a sense of satisfaction for a little bit then we’re done, it’s not going to happen,” Harris said. “Whatever happens after the election, it doesn’t stop there. Our work isn’t ever going to be done.” Satvika Neti, a graduate student in the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, said People’s Pride is the intersectional approach she’s always wanted from pride and is happy it continued despite the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the People’s Pride, this is the intersectional approach we’ve always wanted for pride,” Neti said. “The fact that they’re able to do it despite the pandemic, and do it safely and do it well and so beautifully with all the artwork is amazing.” Neti added that for students like herself, it’s important to remember that they are still a part of the Pittsburgh community while they’re in the City. “Things that happen here affect [students] as well, even though we are kind of sequestered in an Oakland bubble,” Neti said. “It’s important to show up for the community because they have consistently and constantly shown up for us.” "" )",Hill District,politics/activism,2020-2025
PN_HD18," Pitt CEC in the Hill District fosters community growth By Jessica Snyder, Senior Staff Writer According to the Allegheny Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods, Pitt’s Oakland campus expanded in relation to the urban renewal crisis in Pittsburgh in the 50s, a little less than a century ago. While the University wasn’t a direct assailant in the displacement of Pittsburgh communities, it is actively working towards healing relationships with these communities. One of the ways that Pitt has aimed to do this is through Community Engagement Centers, the oldest of which is located in Homewood and was established in 2018. Meanwhile, located on Wylie Avenue, the Pitt CEC in the Hill District is among the closest to Pitt’s Oakland campus. John Blair | Senior Staff Photographer Pitt’s current CEC building on Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. Pitt’s current CEC building on Wylie Avenue in the Hill District.(John Blair | Senior Staff Photographer) Pitt’s Community Engagement Center opened its doors in the Hill District just over a year ago. As a part of CEC, Pitt has also ensured a 15year commitment in these partnered neighborhoods at the bare minimum, according to Kirk Holbrook, director of the Hill CEC. The goal of the time commitment is to allow the University and Pittsburgh communities to grow stronger together, according to the CEC website. Early on in its history, the building that now houses the Pitt CEC was once the Hebrew Institute of Pittsburgh. The building was used as space for Jewish immigrant children to receive cultural education in the early 20th century. The Hebrew lettering above the doorway still stands, announcing it as the Hebrew Institute of Pittsburgh, even though it no longer serves that purpose. "", ""Later on, 1908 Wylie Avenue became the Kay Boys’ Club. This program served to provide afterschool activities for boys, more generally children, who were affected by the economic dislocation at the time. Just like the Hebrew Institute of Pittsburgh, the Kay Boys’ Club provided a space for people with common backgrounds to come together and collaborate. Brenda Tate, a longtime community member and a member of the Neighborhood Advisory Council for the Hill District Community Engagement Center, fondly remembers her memories at the Kay Boys’ Club as a child. “This building played a major role in my life and growing up. Matter of fact, the room that we’re in used to be the kindergarten room, the young nurserytype room,” Tate said. “When it was the Kay Boys’ Club, I spent time in this room because you transition to each age group in different rooms.” According to Tate, the Hill CEC is doing everything that previous organizations had done in the same building — providing a community space for meaningful outreach. While it is a Pittaffiliated building now, its main goal is to serve as a resource to the community. Now, both Pitt students and community members can come together and engage with the resources and programs that the Hill CEC has to offer, according to Tate. The building is now called the Blakey Program Center, paying homage to Bill Blakey, who did a great deal of community work through the Hill House Association. Pitt has had a lessthanideal relationship with the Hill District community in the past, according to Tate. One of the main reasons for this is urban renewal in Pittsburgh. Urban renewal happened in cities more generally across the nation, and even the world, during the 1950s. It included plans to build up various cities, while knocking down buildings in disrepair in poorer areas at the same time. Black and immigrant populations were disproportionately affected by the various urban renewal projects. In Pittsburgh, the Urban Redevelopment Authority demolished essential buildings, including places of residence, in the Lower Hill District to make way for the Civic Arena. With time, the Civic Arena was demolished too. Even though the building of the Civic Arena caused hardship, its removal sparked even more as capital moved elsewhere in Pittsburgh, leaving the Hill District. The URA also demolished buildings in what is now considered North Oakland. Though now thought of as an area primarily occupied by Pitt, it wasn’t always that way. Before urban renewal, North Oakland was considered to be part of the Hill District. The Cost Sports Center, Trees Hall and the Petersen Events Center lie there now. In regard to the commitment between Pitt and the Hill District, La’Vette Wagner, another member of the Neighborhood Advisory Council for the Hill District Community Engagement Center, said trust is built between an institution and a community when the institution is supportive. “The institution is in the community for the right things, to help the community to build up the community, to not take from a community and leave,” Wagner said. According to Holbrook, the CECs routinely hold programs that combine resources that Pitt has with ideas that the community has in order to make the dreams that both have of working together become a reality. Some programs have included Career Information Sessions, Data Literacy and Skills Training, PittServes and Swanson School Collaborative Outreach and others. Accessibility is something that’s also very important in making these CECs function, according to Marlo Hall, community resident and former outreach coordinator for the Hill CEC, now with Pitt’s Center for Creativity, so phone calls and physical flyers are made in addition to resources online. Right now, Pitt is investing $6 million into the New Granada Theater and a brand new adjoining building that the Hill Community Development Corporation will develop as the new site for the CEC in the Hill District. "", "" The New Granada Theater, Pitt’s new CEC building, on Centre Avenue in the Hill District. (John Blair | Senior Staff Photographer) The important part about such an investment is that Pitt has the funds available for the community right now, according to Holbrook — this isn’t something that they have to wait for. This money isn’t from loans or grants, signifying the priority that Pitt is taking in establishing a good relationship with the Hill District community, according to Holbrook. According to Holbrook, Pitt has left ownership in the hands of each CEC itself to create strong community ties. Holbrook said this aims to preserve the Community Engagement Centers as the guaranteed middleground between Pitt and the communities that it is working with.

PN_HD19," Pitt expands collaboration and opportunities to Hill District with new Community Engagement Center location By Madison Dean, Senior Staff Writer For Kelly Protho, the new director of Pitt’s Community Engagement Center, developments within the CEC in the Hill District are important to both Pitt and the neighborhoods the University impacts. “The Hill CEC creates a space that mobilizes Pitt’s talent and resources, in partnership with the Hill community, to provide these and other opportunities directly to residents,” Protho said. The Hill District Community Engagement Center, established in 2019, serves as a bridge for collaboration and opportunity between the University of Pittsburgh and its surrounding TPN File Image neighborhoods. Currently located at the Blakely Program The New Granada Theater, Pitt’s new CEC building, on Centre Avenue in the Center, the CEC offers various programs, educational Hill District. opportunities and events for Hill District residents. This spring, the CEC welcomed Kelly Protho as its new director and announced its relocation to the Historic New Granada Theater. Protho said she is excited to partner and collaborate with Pitt staff and the Hill community and looks forward to the Center’s new space. “The history that the theater holds within the community and Black culture is so rich, and for us to be moving into that space is amazing,” Protho said. A groundbreaking ceremony on May 25 began construction and renovations at the New Granada Theater, where the CEC will serve as an anchor tenant along with retail, restaurant and office spaces. Keith Caldwell, executive director of Place Based Initiatives for Neighborhood Commitments, said the new space will double the size of the old CEC and include a STEAM studio, a “key component” of the center. The 20,000 square foot facility will also house additional classrooms and offices for departments like the Center for African American Poetry and Poetics and the School of Social Work. Marlo Hall, outreach coordinator of the CEC, said the relocation to the Theater space will help the CEC establish a “real footprint” in the Hill District community. “This development will also increase awareness of the CEC and allow more residents to become acquainted with our work and opportunities that are provided at the CEC through our University and community partnerships,” Hall said. The CEC is part of a longterm partnership with Pitt through the Neighborhood Commitments program, a 15 yearlong commitment of “investment, infrastructure, programming, and dedicated staff,” according to Protho. She said neighborhood advisory councils, University partners and community members help the program build strong relationships with the Hill District. “Community Engagement Centers anchor the commitment, creating a front door to Pitt right in the community and a vibrant and welcoming space for programs and collaboration,” Protho said. "", ""Pitt Community Engagement Centers target areas and goals unique to each community within the Oakland, Hill District, Homewood and Greater Hazelwood neighborhoods. The Hill’s CEC focuses on Digital Equity and STEAM programs with emphasis on youth enrichment and workforce development, according to Caldwell. “Our work is not just done in communities like the Hill District, but with them,” Caldwell said, “and each community’s needs are different.” Protho said the increased focus on digital equity and STEAM programming in the CEC’s future location continues to provide shared spaces and engagement with community members. “This type of programming is what the community has identified as important for their residents, but that may not be easy to participate in,” Protho said. Caldwell said Neighborhood Commitments links the strength of the University with the success of communities like the Hill District. As the CEC expands its physical space to accommodate more programming and educational opportunities for the neighborhood, Pitt will use its resources, research and innovation to continue fostering a collaborative and creative community. “Our goal is to partner with communities and help them thrive,” Caldwell said. “We understand that this work can only move as fast and as far as our ability to build trusting relationships. People connect with each other, not an institution.” "" )",Hill District,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025
PN_HD20," Sam Clancy: A guarantee on Pittsburgh’s Mount Rushmore By Conor Hutchison, Senior Staff Writer Pittsburgh is home to some of the most important figures in sports history –– so many the Steel City should have its own Mount Rushmore. Why isn’t there one? Mount Washington has plenty of room where a large Iron City Beer billboard currently sits. But a monument of this kind can only have four faces. Cutting the nominees down to four might take longer than actually sculpting the thing. But the city and the powers that be can only deliberate over three. Sam Clancy’s spot is guaranteed. In Pittsburgh, June 24 is Sam Clancy Day. The corner of Bedford Avenue and Roberts Street in the Hill District is named Sam Clancy Way. The next step in Clancy’s immortalization — before he’s sculpted into Mount Washington, of course — is Pitt men’s basketball retiring Clancy’s No. 15 jersey into the rafters of the Petersen Events Center on Jan. 18. Clancy’s No. 15 is just Pitt’s fifth men’s basketball jersey retired, with the last occurring 15 years ago for Brandin Knight’s No. 20 in 2009. Clancy averaged 14.4 points and 11.6 rebounds per game as a fouryear starter for Pitt basketball. Clancy is the only Panther to ever eclipse 1,000 points, 1,671 total, and 1,000 rebounds with 1,362 total — the most in school history. Despite a successful college basketball career, Clancy was a professional football player in both the NFL and USFL. Courtesy of Pitt Athletics Pitt men’s basketball head coach Jeff Capel made the announcement during Pitt versus Cal in front of almost Sam Clancy averaged a doubledouble in all four years as a Panther from 50,000 people at Acrisure Stadium. It was a complete 19771981. surprise to Clancy, who stood next to sophomore guard Jaland Lowe, who will wear Clancy’s No. 15 for, “as long as he’s here,” according to Clancy. Clancy wasn’t sure why he was on the field at all. The original plan was to honor Pitt football’s 2004 and 1979 — who Clancy went to school with — Fiesta Bowl teams and call each player’s name individually. The plan then changed to showcasing the Pitt basketball team ahead of the season. The announcement, let alone the honor, was a complete surprise to Clancy. “I’m told to stay on the field for the recognition,” Clancy said. “Because I played professional football, but not in college, the ‘79 team wanted me to come out on the field with them, but I said no, because at Pitt, I was a basketball player.” The surprise was almost ruined several times. Multiple people said, “congratulations” to Clancy’s wife in the lead up to the announcement, but had to wiggle out of an explanation each time not to ruin the moment. "", ""“I’m in everybody’s apartment, work space, all week after we got back from a cruise,” Clancy said. “Everybody acting weird towards me all week, cutting our conversations short. Everybody had meetings all of a sudden. On the day of the game, everybody was being weird towards my wife too, but it’s all because they knew I’d get the surprise out of them if we talked for too long.” “The basketball team walks out. I’m standing on the sideline just to watch them get their honor,” Clancy said. “Then I’m told to walk out with the team, and I’m resisting. ‘Let these boys get their flowers, man, I’m an alumni and I support ‘em’. Then Matt Plizga [associate athletic director, strategic communications] puts his arm around me and says, ‘Walk with me.’” Then, Capel said the magic words. “Pitt men’s basketball athletics is going to honor a true legend in the city of Pittsburgh and Pitt men’s basketball when we retire Sam Clancy’s No. 15 jersey,” Capel said on the field. “That’s when I just lost it. The emotion was real,” Clancy said. “I didn’t know anything. I look at the video now and I still get choked up because I appreciate the selection committee, Coach Capel and the basketball guys for recognizing me as one of them.” The honor reinforced that Clancy made the correct decision 47 years ago to stay home and play collegiate basketball less than two miles away from his house at the University of Pittsburgh. “I think Pittsburgh people are loyal. Pittsburgh gives you a small town, everybody appreciates youtype of feeling, even though we’re a big city,” Clancy said. “I came to Pitt because my family trusted Tim Grgurich [former head coach of Pitt men’s basketball] and the staff.” Grgurich, a Lawrenceville native, knew what he had to do to keep Clancy, who was recruited by “over 200 schools,” local. “Grgurich, unofficially, came to my house 5060 times because of the outdoor high school summer league,” Clancy said. “Every day, he’d drive past the house on Bedford Avenue [the street now named after Clancy], and Grgurich ate dinner at my house. He knew every one of my relatives’ names. Pitt would come out, hang on the corner and just talk to you.” Although Clancy was strongly leaning toward committing to Pitt, he kept his college options open into his senior season — until another local legend in the middle of a historic year vouched for Pitt. “Who sealed the deal for me was Tony Dorsett [a Rochester, Pennsylvania, native who went on to win the Heisman Trophy that season],” Clancy said. “I was on the sideline for a rivalry game, Tony ran off during warmups and said, ‘Hey Sam, I’m telling you, stay home for your family, stay home for your community, and they’ll love you forever and take care of you, man.’” First, Clancy had to take care of Pitt. With Clancy on the roster, the Panthers had four straight winning seasons and a 1981 Eastern 8 Championship. On the way, of course, Clancy grabbed a lot of boards. “I always tell the basketball team that my rebound record is going to stand forever because everybody is shooting threes now. It’s a lot of long rebounds,” Clancy said. “I’m only 6’6”, but I came at a time when I had to play center.” As a 1979 AllAmerican Honorable Mention, Clancy tried out for Team USA in 1979 to compete in the Pan American Games, unsure if he’d make the team that was coached by legendary coach Bob Knight. “We had two more days left of practice. One of the coaches on the selection committee, who was good friends with Grgurich, told me that coach Knight loved me because I’m his type of player,” Clancy said. “Physical, go after the ball, take no crap from anybody and push guys around. The coach said, ‘Just don’t mess it up in the next two days, and you’ll make the team.’ That just made me play more intensely.” “I love playing against the best,” Clancy said. “It brings the best out of you.” Clancy, who pulled down the fourthmost boards for the team, made Team USA alongside players that would go on to become NBA legends — Isiah Thomas, Ralph Sampson and Kevin McHale. Team USA went on to win the gold medal against Puerto Rico, and Clancy and his teammates were the first Team USA team to average more than 100 points a game. Traditional fraternities only allow single membership, but Clancy was invited to every brotherhood he was around. The ‘79 Fiesta Bowl team wanted Clancy on the field despite never playing college football. Team USA added Clancy to the roster after competing with tobe NBA legends. This season’s basketball team wanted Clancy on the field and recognized as one of their own. There’s one more fraternity Clancy’s name is wrongly missing from. It’s generally accepted that the NBA and NFL have fought over the draft rights of only three different athletes — Bud Grant, Dave Winfield and Dave Logan. Clancy is the glaring omission. The Phoenix Suns of the NBA drafted Clancy with the 62nd overall pick in the 1981 NBA draft, and a year later the Seattle Seahawks of the NFL drafted Clancy with the 284th overall pick in the NFL Draft. Clancy should absolutely qualify, but historians have made an error. "", ""“I have no idea why I’m not on that list,” Clancy said. “I should reach out to the NFL. Maybe this article will help correct it.” Clancy thinks it’s because he never played in an NBA game at all but did have a productive professional career with the Billings Volcanoes of the CBA, where he averaged 11.5 points and 8.3 rebounds over 41 games in 1981. “I got cut from the Phoenix Suns. Larry Nance and Craig Dykema, who was drafted the round after me, made the team,” Clancy said. “I was strictly a power forward, but Dykema was a swing player who could play the two or three position. When I got released by the Suns and was sent to Billings, Montana, the head coach said, ‘Sam, we’re looking for a bigger power forward, and already have a guy just like you [Truck Robinson]’. I was an inside player at 6’6”. You move me past 12 feet and I’m shooting air balls. When they say I played professional basketball, it was with the Billings Volcanoes.” The obvious question is how Clancy, a fouryear basketball star at Pitt, NBA draft pick and professional player in the CBA, got drafted by the Seattle Seahawks despite not playing football since high school. “The very first day I’m in Billings, I get to the hotel and the light on my hotel phone is flashing, meaning I had a message,” Clancy said. “I go down to the front desk and get my pink slip to read the message. It was Chuck Allen [director of Pro Scouting] from the Seattle Seahawks who called and left his number. Why would the Seahawks be calling me? They’d only been around like five years, and I don’t play football. I call him back and he says, ‘Sam, I know you didn’t play football, but Jackie Sherrill [Pitt football head coach from 197781] gave us your name and said he thinks you can compete in the NFL.’” Former Pitt football head coach Jackie Sherrill chased Clancy for all four years at Pitt. Eventually, when Pitt forced Grgurich to resign after the 1980 season, Clancy was fed up with the basketball program. He gave in to Sherrill’s repeated requests to come out for the football team, but after a week playing defensive end, Clancy returned to the basketball team for his senior season. “With no football talent, no football skills outside of what I learned in high school, Sherrill put me as the backup defensive end,” Clancy said. “We had a serious offensive line that I was going against, and I guess I was doing OK against the starters. He said, ‘Play football for two years and I’ll make you an AllAmerican.’ The new basketball coach, Roy Chipman said, ‘Sam, they say you’re trying out for football. But, if you want to play football, I have to build my team without you. You’re a star player, and we need you on the basketball team.’ Right then, I came back to basketball because that’s what I was — a basketball player.” Clancy never told Sherrill he was quitting after a week with the football team, but Sherrill didn’t hold any grudges. Two years later, a single week of spring ball turned out as a de facto tryout for the NFL, and Clancy proved he could play both sports. Allen originally said the Seahawks would sign Clancy as an undrafted free agent. But after learning the Washington Redskins had reached out to Clancy through the mail, Allen drafted Clancy in the 11th round as a complete unknown. “After drafting me, Allen said, ‘What position do you want to play?’ I said I like scoring touchdowns because in my senior year of high school, I played tight end, so Allen drafted me as a tight end,” Clancy said. “Offense was hard, I’m not going to lie. It took me a while, but I impressed them because I ran a foursix and had decent hands. Next year with a new coach that was planning on cutting me, I got moved to dend, which worked out because I liked hitting people, the physicality and my agility from playing basketball.” Clancy spent two seasons in Seattle then returned home to Pittsburgh to play for the Maulers of the USFL — a rival football league to the NFL that produced several Pro Football Hall of Famers. “The USFL was offering good money,” Clancy said. “You had a quarter of the league that came from the NFL to the USFL, so it was a competitive league. Steve Young, Jim Kelly, [and] I played with Reggie White. They all came from the USFL. I didn’t have one regular season snap in Seattle. My first sack came against Steve DeBerg in Denver in the postseason, and we won that game. That led the Maulers to come calling. The money was three times what I was making in Seattle, and I was coming home to my family, so it was a nobrainer.” Clancy recorded 17 sacks, good for second in the league, in his first season with the Maulers. He then spent a year in Memphis in the final year of the USFL. “The Seahawks still had my rights even though I was playing in the USFL and traded my rights to the Browns,” Clancy said. “I enjoyed those four years with the Browns. We were good, a playoff team. Everybody on the Browns were like brothers.” Unfortunately, Clancy’s fiveyear stint with the Indianapolis Colts after his fouryear contract with the Browns was the complete opposite. “We had all the talent in the world. Eric Dickerson, two ProBowl offensive linemen, AllPro center, AllPro tackle and AllPro linebacker, and then in my second year there, we had the very first pick of the draft,” Clancy said. “In my first year with the Colts, I wanted to go back to the Browns, and they wanted me back too, but I had signed a contract.” The Colts went 115 in Clancy’s third year and had both the first and second overall draft picks in the 1992 draft. "", ""Clancy finished his NFL career with 30 recorded sacks — not bad for a multisport athlete who never played defensive end until he was paid to do so. His favorite two are against a pair of alltime quarterbacks. “John Elway. There’s a picture of it on the internet. It doesn’t look like I sacked him, but I tripped him up,” Clancy said. “But my very first sack is really special with Steve DeBerg because, even though I was already on the team, it jump started my career. It got me home to the Maulers, and then to Memphis, and developed enough to end like this.” After an illustrious professional career across four different leagues and in two different sports, Clancy is now the director of Pitt’s Varsity Letter Club and is responsible for athletic alumni relations — a pivotal role in the success of Pitt basketball. If that big year is this year, it’s because of the sophomore guard wearing Clancy’s No. 15, Jaland Lowe. “I told him, ‘This is your team,’” Clancy said of Lowe. “I think Lowe is a heck of a leader, a heck of a point guard, and can really score. I think we go as far as Jaland [Lowe] leads us.” “I was here watching a little scrimmage, in practice, and I’ve seen that leadership, coaching other guys up,” Clancy said.” And don’t forget this is only his second year. So I’m honored. I’m honored that my jersey is getting retired, and I’m honored Jaland Lowe will still wear the number.” Clancy’s legacy is undeniable — he outmaneuvered his way through any obstacle, around any naysayers and avoided any traditional boundaries that limit athletes to a single sport in a world of everincreasing specialization. “I hoped this day would come,” Clancy said. “I didn’t know if I accomplished enough to get it done. In my eyes, I think I could’ve accomplished more.” Clancy lived a truly oneofakind athletic life and is certainly selling himself short.

PN_HD21," Local stars ready to power Pitt basketball By Conor Hutchison, Senior Staff Writer College athletics is a wide and wild world. Coaches travel across the globe to recruit the best of the best. But in Pittsburgh, all men’s basketball head coach Jeff Capel has to do is look around — there are Panthers everywhere. Pittsburghproduced talent has powered Pitt athletics for decades. South Oakland’s Dan Marino brought Pitt football four consecutive top 10 finishes. The Hill District’s DeJuan Blair led Pitt basketball to an Elite Eight appearance in the 2009 NCAA tournament and Sam Clancy, whose jersey will hang in the rafters of the Pete in January, finished as the only Panther with over 1,000 points and rebounds. Jonathan Guo | Staff Photographer Next in line for locals to fall in love with are firstyear guard The Oakland Zoo is a spirited student section at Pitt sporting events such Brandin “Beebah” Cummings and center Liam Mignogna. as Men’s Basketball game. Cummings won backtoback WPIAL and State Championships at Lincoln Park, a performing arts charter school in Midland, Pennsylvania. Mignogna went to Hampton, a public school in Gibsonia, Pennsylvania, which was the only other school able to compete with Lincoln Park on their way to a Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League Championship and State Championship. For the last few years, the Petersen Event Center has hosted the WPIAL, giving Cummings and Mignogna a taste of the arena they’d spend their first collegiate year in with their future head coach sitting courtside. “It was really a dream come true,” Cummings said. “Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to play in the Pete, and I wanted to play for Pitt. I wanted to have my family here coming to the games and supporting me. Obviously, I had a lot of success in this gym. It meant a lot to me to be able to come to the Pete, show out for my people, and whoop on Liam a little bit.” Cummings committed to Pitt right before his senior year started. The decision was easy for him. “My brother played here before I did, so obviously that weighed in,” Cummings said. “I have wanted to play here since I was a kid. Also, I feel like Coach [Capel] is the best coach in the country. He has a lot of things about him that I relate to. He knows a lot about basketball. He’s the coach I really wanted to play for. Ever since my brother committed, I knew I was going to commit here as well.” Cummings’s older brother, Nelly Cummings, transferred to Pitt after graduating from Colgate and helped the Panthers reach the NCAA Tournament in 2023 — the first time they did so since 2016. Mignogna, however, had a different path to the Pete. The Gibsonia native didn’t announce his commitment until a month after his WPIAL championship loss to Lincoln Park. “I didn’t have any other interest at this level,” Mignogna said. “[Pitt] offered me a walkon spot here. It happened quick, but everyone knows the program is on the uprise. The coaching staff is unbelievable. I’m from Pittsburgh, so there wasn’t much to it. I knew right away this is where I wanted to be.” Similar to Cummings, family ties weighed into Mignogna’s decision to play for his city. “I had a cousin [Ryan Luther] who played basketball here a couple years ago,” Mignogna said. “I’ve always wanted to go to Pitt and have been a huge fan of the basketball program since I was young.” "", ""The two firstyear players and former rivals were impressed with each other’s abilities in high school and can’t wait to see how that talent will translate to bigtime college basketball. “We know if the ball is in Beebah’s hands he’s hard to guard and he can create good shots for himself. Our game plan was to keep the ball out of his hands. We didn’t want to go up and down the court with him. His fullcourt defense and his ability to create shots will still be a huge problem for other teams in college basketball to try and stop.” Cummings is an elite shot creator, perimeter defender and guard. Mignogna’s toptier skills are on the other side of the spectrum and hold a major advantage in height. Cummings’ team had no match for the sixfoot10 Mignogna — the tallest player, Meleek Thomas, a top10 player in the country in the class of 2025 who has Pitt in his top three schools, only stood at sixfootfive. “Our big was sixfootone, his name was Dorian McGhee, and that was Liam’s matchup,” Cummings said. “I guess our plan was to keep him out of the paint, beat him down the floor, just try to get our defense set, and if he gets the ball in the post just let him shoot it, I guess, and hope for the best. Whenever you have someone as big and strong as Liam, it’s hard to gameplan for.” Cummings and Mignogna’s skillsets look easily transferrable to the Panthers, but the local stars enter a locker room chockfull of experience and have to test their metal against refined talent. Although everyone is competing for minutes at this point in the season, the locker room is as tight as ever. “The older guys are so experienced they don’t really even have to explain stuff,” Cummings said. “They just go out on the court and do it. We get to say, ‘Oh, that’s college basketball and that’s what we have to go out and do.’ They do everything they can to make sure we’re straight. We look up to them and try to follow in their footsteps to try and be as successful as possible.” Cummings and Mignogna are two of four true firstyear players rostered. When the local stars stepped foot in the locker room, they quickly realized everyone is treated equally here. “From day one it’s been a family,” Mignogna said. “In the locker room, age doesn’t matter. Everyone treats each other great. We’re all brothers. On the court, you can tell these dudes have experience.” Last season, Pitt proved anyone can shine no matter age or position. The Panthers rostered Carlton ‘Bub’ Carrington, the fourteenth overall pick in the NBA Draft — a true firstyear guard who had freshly turned 18 before the season. But that is in the past. The Panthers are looking up and ahead at what they can do differently. After missing an invitation to the NCAA Tournament and declining an invite to the NIT, Pitt crafted a new battle cry to make this season’s goal clear. “We have a slogan. ‘Leave no doubt.’ Everybody thought we should have been in the tournament,” Cummings said. “I certainly thought that. We just want to make sure we leave no doubt this year. Every day in practice, that’s in the back of our mind.” Last season, Pitt finished fourth in the ACC but wasn’t one of the five ACC teams to make the NCAA tournament — showing that winning the right games matters more than winning in general. The main citation from bracket experts was Pitt’s weak nonconference schedule — 340 out of 362 Division I teams — and its performance in that schedule. This season, the Panthers beefed up those nonconference games with matchups against West Virginia, LSU, UCF or Wisconsin, Ohio State and Mississippi State — all on top of the gauntlet that is the ACC play. Cummings and Mignogna aren’t just playing for Pitt, but their family names and the legacies that come with them. “We can walk down the street and everybody knows who we are. It’s so different going places,” Cummings said. “We’re just regular people, but we appreciate that people look at us like that. Obviously, there’s a standard set that we have to go out there and live up to. We’re ready for it.” Men’s basketball has the task of following up an almost flawless fall sports season from football, volleyball and soccer. Thankfully, Oakland and its inhabitants have made the transition from high school to college easy. “Watching the other fall sports teams and how great they’ve been doing — it’s the talk of the town, football, volleyball, soccer. It’s pretty awesome to see the sports culture here,” Mignogna said. "" )",Hill District,sports,2020-2025
PN_HD22," Plant2Plate still awaiting University development deadline after three years By Amanda Yu, Staff Writer In 2021, the University promised a studentrun community garden, Plant2Plate, one more season before development on their new land would begin. Years later, members are still waiting amid concerns over the garden’s prospective new location. Located at 246 Oakland Ave., the Plant2Plate garden provides a rare green space for students and residents alike. The garden, initially created by Pitt students in 2010 as a sustainability project, rests on an 11,600 square foot lot owned by the university. Inside, student members of the Plant2Plate club grow a large Bhaskar Chakrabarti | Staff Photographer variety of fresh produce to donate to local food insecure populations, primarily through the Pitt Pantry, a Pittoperated food pantry located in the O’Hara Student Center. John Ufer, a junior chemical engineering major and cochair of agriculture for the club, said he believes that without any major supermarkets in the Oakland area, the garden helps students consistently access fresh food. “Its main purpose is to donate food to insecure communities in the Oakland area, because as you and most people know, Oakland is a food desert. There is not much opportunity for produce, especially fresh food, to enter the community,” Ufer said. “Pitt Pantry is mainly shelfstable produce, which is great for sustenance, but the aspect of having fresh fruits and veggies is a very important and nutritious part of people’s meals.” Ufer said Plant2Plate also serves as a green area that helps mitigate feelings of pollution and drag in the dense Oakland area. Despite the opportunities Ufer believes the garden offers, he said Pitt plans to evict the garden within the next few years. They’ll be moved to an area above Upper Campus on Vera Street as part of a relocation plan. “Our current location in Oakland Avenue is currently under transformation to a dormitory, and the garden will be erased probably in 23 years. We’re being evicted,” Ufer said. “In compensation for that construction, we are being moved to Vera Street, which is in North Oakland, bordering Pitt’s campus with the Hill District,” Ufer said. Sustainability students originally received permission to use vacant University land in 2010 on Oakland Avenue. The University agreed to a minimum twoyear contract and said it would give the club a minimum oneyear notice “prior to University groundbreaking.” In 2018, Pitt presented its Institutional Master Plan and Campus Master Plan, which said the garden would “officially be slated for development for sometime in the next 510 years.” In the time since then, housing development for the Oakland Avenue lot has been pushed back to a slower time frame. In 2019, Plant2Plate said they were in talks with the Office of Campus Planning to purchase vacant lots in Oakland to turn into gardens, which ultimately became the land on Vera Street. Club members are still waiting on a clear development deadline from the University. University spokesperson Jared Stonesifer said “there is no nearterm planned development activity on the space and thus no timeline for relocating Plant2Plate.” "", ""“The University has confirmed with the Plant2Plate organization that it is extending the use of the Oakland Avenue location through at least the end of 2026,” Stonesifer said. Although the timeline remains unclear, the University has a clear goal for development. Elise Rinke, a senior and student garden manager, said “eventually the plan is for [the Oakland Avenue lot] to be athletic housing.” Neeha Kolli, a junior environmental science major and cochair of agriculture with Ufer, said she believes the convenience of the current Oakland Avenue garden is part of the appeal. “Between South Oakland and the actual campus, our garden is right between those two, which makes it really accessible,” Kolli said. Kolli said the garden serves students outside of providing produce and a refreshing green space, which is potentially in jeopardy given the new location. “Classes will come and meet in the physical garden space, which is a really big thing that we’re sad to miss in a couple years when we lose that space. It serves as an outdoor classroom, just a great overall space for people to sit and spend time and hang out,” Kolli said. Kolli said she has concerns about the Vera Street location. “The main problems are the quality of the land they gave us, the size of the land they gave us in comparison to the [less than] half acre we have now, and the location in comparison to where the student body is actually found,” Kolli said. “We did soil testing on it, and there’s a lot of salt in the soil, which makes it not ideal growing conditions.” Ufer echoed Kolli’s concerns about where Plant2Plate is being moved to, emphasizing its inaccessibility compared to the current garden on Oakland Ave. “The Vera Street garden was on a greyfield – which is previous construction, there were already buildings there – and they did not do a good job of removing the baseline foundation,” Ufer said. “It is not where the brunt of students are populated, and it also has poor soil quality and is on a very large slope.” The Vera Street lot has a history of construction that also poses a roadblock for planting produce, and Ufer said club members have found miscellaneous construction pieces when inspecting the area. “There are bricks in the soil, there are concrete pieces, you turn up random industrial supplies every single time you try to fish down in the dirt for soil. And the acidity is out of control,” Ufer said. The University noted it was of the club’s soil concerns. “Like many urban garden projects on formerly developed land, including the Oakland Avenue garden, soil quality is always a concern. We are committed to getting the [Vera Street] plot ready for student use, including soil remediation,” Stonesifer said. Kolli said there have been club efforts to negotiate a different relocation. “Our former president, Abhi, sat in on meetings, had meetings with assistant deans [and] heads of planning, to try to advocate for a better space. It’s literally us butting heads with the Pitt Master Plan and all of these administrative blockades,” Kolli said. Ani Nangunoori, a junior computational biology major and Plant2Plate’s current president, said the club hopes to expand into other Oakland locations to keep it active in South Oakland. “There’s a group of students on campus who are involved with the Lawn Street Garden in South Oakland, and there’s another lot over in South Oakland that’s been an abandoned garden space. We’re looking to work with the Oakland Planning and Development Corporation to take stewardship of those garden spaces and provide a space for students and Oakland residents to collaborate in garden endeavors,” Ani Nangunoori said. In the meantime, Abhi Nangunoori, a senior economics and biology major, said Plant2Plate has plans to mitigate the effect of losing the Oakland garden within the community. “We’ve actually partnered with some other organizations, in both the community and on Pitt’s campus, to create what we call pocket gardens. When we do eventually lose [the Oakland Avenue] location, we’ll be able to grow things and keep the club active in these smaller gardens,” Abhi Nangunoori said. University spokesperson Stonesifer cited the pocket gardens concept “as a way to expand Plant2Plate’s presence on other areas of campus.” Kolli said she is optimistic about also continuing the club’s communitybuilding aspect. "", ""“We know how to create community. We were able to do it down here, we’ll find a way to do it up there,” Kolli said. "")",Hill District,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025
PN_HD23," ‘Christmas Day at Pitt’ gathers community for free meals, clothes and gifts By Spencer Levering, Senior Staff Writer From holiday decorations to songs from the Salvation Army’s band, Gabby DeMarchi said during Christmas Day at Pitt, “the spirit is there.” “Towers and The Eatery are kind of turned into a little mini Christmas wonderland in a very lovely, joyful way,” DeMarchi, assistant director of community affairs, said. The Eatery will be filled with food, community members and holiday cheer on Dec. 25 as the University celebrates its 18th annual Christmas Day at Pitt. The event, which will last from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., will provide free hot meals, hot chocolate and winter clothes to anyone who comes, as well TPN File Photo as a free gift for every child 18 or younger. Christmas trees in Schenley Plaza. “You can come in and get a hot meal, you can sit next to your neighbors, you can meet new people, you can connect with Pitt colleagues and you can get a present and get warm accessories,” DeMarchi said. “Pitt will be here for you on a day that sometimes people don’t have a space to go to.” An expected 100 volunteers will help package 3,300 meals, according to the Office of Engagement and Community Affairs, more than doubling the amount of meals packaged from last year’s event. The Salvation Army and other community partners will distribute the meals throughout Hazelwood, Homewood and the Hill District. People over 18 who are interested in packaging food can register to volunteer on Dec. 18 or 19 through PittServes. Another 150 volunteers are expected to serve meals, give gifts to kids and keep the dining and winter clothing areas tidy on Christmas Day. Jose Perez Vela, sustainability director for Pitt EATS, said they are planning to serve “about 500 meals.” The menu includes turkey from a local farmer, a decision made to “make sure we’re supporting the local community first,” according to Perez Vela. “In terms of environmental reasons, we want to ensure we’re reducing our carbon footprint, and by doing so we want to try and support local farmers that are ‘just down the street,’ rather than pulling turkeys from across the world or across the nation,” Perez Vela said. “We pride ourselves on helping the community as much as possible.” Perez Vela added that any leftovers from the event will be frozen and donated or distributed to the community through 412 Food Rescue. Nick Pagano, marketing director for Pitt EATS, said Christmas Day at Pitt is an opportunity to “enhance people’s lives and experiences through food.” “The holiday times — it’s a great time to really take that message and create an event around it and give back,” Pagano said. “Since a lot of different places are closed on Christmas, I think that it’s important to also create this access point for people who might not be able to find a meal somewhere.” Justin Dandoy, director of community affairs, called volunteering on Christmas Day “a fun family affair.” “Our Pitt partners and Pitt staff … come to volunteer, and they oftentimes bring their kids or teenagers or whoever to come help out as well,” Dandoy said. "", ""Community members interested in helping on Dec. 25 can sign up to volunteer through PittServes. In addition to food, Christmas Day at Pitt will provide free winter accessories such as coats, hats, scarves, gloves, socks and mittens for attendees to try on and take home. “People that attend can go through … select what they like, try it on, make sure it fits,” DeMarchi said. “Find what style works for you, what color works for you, and take what you need.” Along with clothing donations from individual community members, True T Pittsburgh, Color Me Urban and the Urban League Young Professionals will also supply the event with coats, according to DeMarchi. Dandoy added that they’re accepting clothing donations, but reminded people to make sure the items they donate are good quality. “If folks do want to donate hats, gloves, scarves, things like that, we’re happy to take those in addition to any gifts that folks would want to donate,” Dandoy said. “The expectation is that we’re giving out new stuff, and so that’s something that folks will want to consider as they make their donations.” Gift drives held by 19 different University departments, offices and Pittsburgharea organizations will provide every child at the event with a free gift. Additional gifts will be distributed throughout Oakland, the Hill District, Homewood and Hazelwood. Community members can donate gifts until Dec. 15 to 710 Alumni Hall. Dandoy, who is organizing the collection and distribution of gifts, said he expects “over a thousand” gifts to be given out. “If you want to contribute … you can bring a gift for a child, you can wrap it or you can not wrap it, whatever works for you, and you could drop it off right in our office,” Dandoy said. “We’re happy to add that to our overall gift drive.” When donating a gift, Dandoy recommended thinking about the needs of middle schoolers and teenagers. “It’s fun to buy toys and gifts and stuff for little kids, but we want to make sure that we provide things for everyone,” Dandoy said. “If you’re wanting to donate a gift between now and the time this event happens, that’s something you could always consider.” To Dandoy, the highlight of Christmas Day at Pitt is the opportunity to provide the Pittsburgh community a way to grow closer. “Those folks come in for Christmas Day at Pitt, it doesn’t matter who they are,” Dandoy said. “They can get a gift, they can get the accessories, they can have a meal with us. There’s no expectations or requirements for the day for folks coming — it’s just about the chance for us to build some community.” "" )",Hill District,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025
PN_HD24," Pitt acquires archive of late playwright August Wilson By Charlie Taylor, Culture Editor Playwright August Wilson was born and raised in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. And although he spent the last 15 years of his life in Seattle, part of his legacy has returned to his hometown. Pitt announced Thursday that the University Library System has acquired the August Wilson Archive. Wilson wrote the Pulitzer Prizewinning plays “Fences” and “The Piano Lesson,” which are part of his 10play “Pittsburgh Cycle,” or “American Century Cycle.” The plays in that series take place in the Hill District and address Black experience during each decade of the 20th century. The archive contains over 450 boxes of material, including drafts of scripts for Wilson’s published and unpublished plays, personal correspondences with friends and colleagues and his Pulitzer Prize certificates. ULS director Kornelia Photo Courtesy of the August Wilson Archive Tancheva said this archive is “the most significant archival Playwright August Wilson was born and raised in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. collection the University of Pittsburgh has acquired to date.” “It presents unprecedented opportunities for engagement for our students and the local community,” Tancheva said. “The August Wilson Archive supports our mission of preserving and making accessible the cultural heritage of the region, the country and the world, and specifically our focus on underrepresented voices and the cultural production of African American artists.” Wilson’s first play with a theater company, a 1976 production of “Homecoming,” took place at Kuntu Repertory Theatre in Oakland with the help of Pitt professor Vernell Lillie. Wilson also worked with Bob Johnson, a former faculty member of the Africana Studies department, to produce “Jitney” in 1982. ULS currently houses collections related to Kuntu Repertory Theatre, Lillie and Johnson. ULS obtained the August Wilson Archive, which it will begin to process in early 2021, with the help of Wilson’s widow and executor of his estate, Constanza Romero. Romero reflected in a statement on the influence of Pittsburgh on Wilson’s work. “He left Pittsburgh in 1978, but he took the Hill, the three rivers, the streets, the steel mills, the fish sandwich shops and the cadence of the language he heard in cigar stores and barbershops with him,” she said. “This and more became the cultural richness that the playwright would pour into his 10play magnum opus, the ‘American Century Cycle.’” ULS said it plans to make the archive available for research and programming, and hopes to work with Pitt’s Community Engagement Centers to bring the collection to local communities. The library system will also provide the August Wilson African American Cultural Center in Downtown with materials for an upcoming permanent exhibit, called “August Wilson: The Writer’s Landscape,” according to Tancheva. Although the archive will bring the playwright’s legacy back to the City where he started his career, Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said Pitt’s acquisition of the archive is “about more than bringing August Wilson back home.” “This archive deftly puts the experiences of Black Americans beneath an intimate magnifying glass and unpacks themes of injustice and inequity that are just as relevant today as when Wilson’s first play debuted,” Gallagher said. “The University of Pittsburgh is proud to do our part in keeping August Wilson’s brilliance — for those in Pittsburgh and far beyond — alive, and we are deeply grateful to Constanza for entrusting us with this task.” "", """")",Hill District,art,2020-2025

PN_HD26," We are widening the corridors and adding more lanes.” If we take these lyrics literally, it just about sums up transportation policy in this country. America is too busy sacrificing the environment and quality of our social fabric at the altar of car culture to pay much attention to how destructive it is. When this carcentric lifestyle hits a bump in the road — pun intended — our policy solution is usually more roads with more lanes, so that we can accommodate our Image via Carol M. Highsmith, Wikimedia Commons some 289.5 million registered vehicles. This is especially U.S. Interstate Highway 279, heading northwest out of Pittsburgh, evident in Pennsylvania, which continues to shovel money Pennsylvania. into highways at the expense of people and the planet. Take, for example, the $117.8 million project on I70 that will expand a section of the interstate from two to three lanes, despite the fact that this will probably do nothing to alleviate congestion. Induced demand, an economic concept describing how demand moves to fill excess supply, dictates that we’d be just as well off having a $117.8 million bonfire. Or how about the new 13mile, nearly billion dollar stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike that partially opened in October as part of the Southern Beltway project? This money would be put to much greater use funding public transportation, mitigating the effects of climate change or restoring neighborhoods torn apart by highways. We’re likely to see another flurry of these wasteful projects, given that the bipartisan infrastructure bill contains $110 billion in new funds for the nation’s roads and bridges — compared to $39 billion for public transit. President Joe Biden initially wanted $85 billion for public transit, but the grueling negotiation process whittled this down. The new funds for roads and bridges also have no stipulation requiring they be put toward repairing existing roads, and can just as easily be spent on extending traffic capacity. It’s remarkable how much money we’re willing to funnel into accommodating cars, despite all they’ve taken from us — these funds included. We can look within Pittsburgh to see the damage. Downtown used to be home to a small but vibrant Chinatown packed with businesses and, at its peak, an estimated 500 residents. Unfortunately, the construction of the Boulevard of the Allies in the 1920s cut through the neighborhood, dispersing residents. Today, only one restaurant remains — the Chinatown Inn. The Boulevard cuts through many other Pittsburgh neighborhoods, including Oakland. It’s part of the reason that South Oakland proper feels so disconnected from the rest of the neighborhood. The Hill District is the City’s most prominent example of the destruction wrought by major roadways. Constructed in the 1950s, I579 severed the neighborhood from Downtown and, combined with the construction of Civic Arena and parking lots in the Lower HIll, involved the displacement of 8,000 mostly Black residents. In order to make room for automobiles, a thriving hub for arts, music and commerce once known as the “crossroads of the world” was gutted. Current and former residents pay a social, economic and cultural price for this loss every day, as does the rest of the City. The City has begun to make muchbelated amends with the Frankie Pace Park, which was dedicated earlier this month and reestablishes a connection between Downtown and the Hill District, but the damage caused by these socalled urban renewal projects can never be fully undone. "", ""None of this is to mention the catastrophic damage our reliance on cars does to the environment. Automobiles are immensely energyintensive to manufacture, they’re America’s largest source of carbon emissions and they are partially nonrecyclable once they hit the junkyard. They’re also responsible for onethird of all air pollution in the country — a particularly pressing point given Pittsburgh’s abysmal air quality. We also need to reckon with the ecological impact of new roads. Highways, such as the Southern Beltway project, split habitats in two — potentially putting food, water and mates out of reach for some animals. The chemical, noise and light pollution caused by cars increase mortality for animals and disrupt their biological processes. And of course, Pennsylvania drivers are all too familiar with roadkill. Our insatiable appetite for bigger and better roads costs us our money, the fabric of our neighborhoods and the health of our environment. The dogma of car culture says we must widen the corridors and add a few more lanes — are we brave enough to rethink it? Jack Troy writes primarily about local politics and being tired of capitalism.

PN_HD27," Pitt’s Office of Facilities Management offers new apprenticeship program for engineers By Alaina Goldberg, For The Pitt News After working as a mechanic at the Heinz Ketchup Corporation for 10 years, Lemel Alexander was searching for a career change. He ultimately found a Pitt program where he wasn’t simply sitting in a classroom or reading textbooks. A new apprenticeship program through Pitt’s Office of Facilities Management began this fall for individuals from the Hill District interested in becoming licensed engineers. The program, which lasts four years, places apprentices in a rotating schedule where they are partnered with a licensed engineer for on the job and classroom training. The Office of Facilities Management along with community John Blair | Senior Staff Photographer members from the Hill District who are involved in the The University of Pittsburgh Office of Facilities Management on Forbes Community Engagement Center interviewed six candidates Avenue. over the summer for the program, and eventually hired two people. Dan Fisher, assistant vice chancellor for operations and maintenance, said the program came from a request from the Hill District Development Review Panel. Fisher said the program is the first of its kind because it includes community partners. “We readily agreed [to the program] and were really excited to have the opportunity to work with the Hill District community,” Fisher said. Kirk Holbrook, the director for the CEC in the Hill District, said he felt similar to Fisher, adding that the program “was a great win.” He said the victory came at a great time for the center’s evolution in the Hill District. “It is our job [at the CEC] to liaise between the community and the University,” Holbrook said. “This program does just that — by creating a new partnership through the Hill District with the institution that meets the needs of those in the community.” Alexander joined this apprenticeship program to better support himself and his family in the future. He heard about the opportunity through the CEC’s website. He said the classes include heating, ventilation and air conditioning levels one to three, electrical and safety, which are applicable for a variety of career paths. “For example, plumbing classes are included in our course load,” Alexander said. “Apprentices could take this program in a different career direction if they wanted.” Alexander said the interview process included a Zoom call with people from both Pitt and CEC. He said while Pitt is a large campus, everyone has been so kind to him. Alexander said he feels that in this position he can “strive” on Pitt’s campus. Holbrook said after completing the fouryear program, there are many opportunities for career growth, not only in the City, but also across the country. “I want people to understand that those in the apprenticeship program come out after four years earning family supporting wages,” Holbrook said. “These are life changing opportunities.” "", ""Fisher said the engineering job market has increased substantially in recent years. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that jobs in architecture and engineering will grow 6% from 2020 to 2030. While the program benefits future engineers like Alexander who plan to enter the job market upon program completion, Holbrook said it was important that they included community members in the interview process in order to “bring this idea to fruition.” “This gave us a real and authentic feel to what we are doing,” Holbrook said. “I want to see the involvement of community voices alongside the institution continue in the future.” Fisher said members of the program can also share experiences and events with the University on campus, which makes it a “double win.” He said he is hopeful the program will expand into other departments. “We want to strengthen the connection between the University and the community. This has been something we have always worked at, along with increasing diversity,” Fisher said. The apprentices connect the University and the surrounding community through projects, such as the chilled water plant project on the northern part of Pitt’s campus. The area is under construction now, but Fisher said once adjustments are made, apprentices will be learning how to operate the plant and work at the location. Fisher said the chilled water plant project had 39% project participation from women and womenowned businesses during its development phases. He said they are offering work opportunities to bring more minorities on campus in the future. Holbrook said meeting needs across the community and having economic success helps the CEC feel like they are doing the right thing. “Showcasing what the University can do when we work collectively to change efforts in economic engagement is a step forward along a journey that we hope will introduce transformative processes across campus,” Holbrook said. Those interested in the facilities apprenticeship program can apply through the University’s Talent Center. Pitt hires apprentices directly online when positions are available. The International Union of Operating Engineers website also has classes online related to the apprenticeship, along with continuing education for licensed engineers.

PN_HD28," De’Jovia Davis leads in all corners of campus life By Stephen Thompson, Sports Editor It’s hard to be at Pitt — whether as a prospective student or head coach of the women’s basketball team — and not cross paths with De’Jovia Davis, a senior urban studies major known to friends as Jovi. Panther fans have certainly enjoyed the fruits of her labor while cheering on the women’s basketball team at the Pete, or taking in a Pitt band performance at Heinz Field. Potential Panthers have been on her tours around campus, and incoming students have met a figure who is helping them get used to college life. To some, it seems like Davis is using superhuman effort to Pamela Smith | Visual Editor create time for a myriad of jobs and activities. But to her, it De’Jovia Davis, a senior urban studies major, is a 2021 Homecoming Spirit doesn’t feel Herculean. Davis composed a loaded schedule of Pitt award recipient, Pathfinder, First Year Mentor, assistant drum major gradually, integrating jobs and clubs as she grew into herself and the head student manager of the women’s basketball team. at Pitt. Now she has extended her reach all across campus and beyond, from mentoring to community service to athletics. “I’m able to do what I love,” Davis said. “I love going to practice. I love going to band. I love giving tours for Pathfinders. So everything I do, that I’m busy with, it’s not like I have to go here. I want to go here and I’m the type of person that likes to be busy.” Davis is deeply involved with each organization she’s affiliated with. Davis is a fouryear member of the Pathfinders, Pitt’s tour guide group. She’s also a First Year Mentor, working with young students to help them get adjusted to Pitt and college life in general. She has two hands in Pitt athletics, as an assistant drum major — the first Black woman to ever hold that position — and head student manager of the women’s basketball team. All of her work culminated in a proverbial crowning achievement this fall. During the Homecoming football game vs. New Hampshire on Sept. 25, Davis won the Spirit of Pitt Award, which honors two students at Pitt who “display a commitment to academic excellence, community service and the Pitt Alumni Association’s values.” When Davis accepted the award while standing on the 50yard line of Heinz Field, she had the Pitt band — a collection of some of her longestheld and closest friends — at her back, and her family, who made long trips to meet in Pittsburgh for that special day, in the stands cheering along with the rest of the stadium. Her parents and sister Deonnah came from their hometown of Savannah, Georgia, and her other two sisters, Danielle and Diazmyn, trekked from their respective schools — Kennesaw State University and the University of Kentucky. The moment was years in the making and began when Davis auditioned for the band prior to arriving on campus in fall 2018. Chrissy Shannon, a 2020 Pitt alumna and the first female drum major in the band’s history, and Davis were close during their shared time in the Pitt band. Shannon was Davis’ “big brother” in Kappa Kappa Psi, a band fraternity that, according to Shannon, seeks out and tries to foster future leaders within the band as a whole. When Davis joined during her first year, Shannon, a trailblazing drum major herself, instantly recognized that Davis had the kind of magnetism and leadership qualities that are necessary to be successful in such a role. "", ""Davis initially showed interest in following in Shannon’s footsteps as a drum major “late in the game,” according to Shannon. But when the burgeoning band star did, Shannon was immediately supportive. And when she finally earned the position of assistant drum major and followed in Shannon’s barrierbreaking footsteps, feelings of hope turned to joy and pride. “It’s a relief, first of all, that it wasn’t just oneanddone then go back to the way things were,” Shannon said. “But I think she’s the perfect person. I just trust her. I don’t worry about anything. She’s perfect for the job. … It’s not shocking. It’s really nice and I’m really proud of her.” Those skills translated well to her role as a basketball manager, which Davis picked up in the fall of her sophomore year. She saw a flyer hanging around campus and contacted the program’s director of operations, Ali Hoesly. Like Shannon, Hoesly was immediately struck by Davis’ intangibles. Hoesly said she was professional, instinctive and had an xfactor that endeared her to the players and coaching staff immediately. She’s detailoriented as well, Hoesly said, remembering and maintaining even the smallest of routines, like how head coach Lance White enjoys his iced tea with extra ice. She was an obvious choice to take over the role of head manager in her junior year, according to Hoesly. “In her second year with us, we promoted her to head manager,” Hoesly said. “She just displays a ton of leadership qualities. She is super organized and dedicated. She gets the basketball world in the sense that we move fast and you have to keep up and anticipate.” Davis’ duties primarily involve overseeing the other managers, but she also plays a direct role herself, helping set up practice, acting as a liaison for program staff and traveling with the team, among other constantly changing, daily tasks. Hoesly and Davis have become close over their time working together. Hoesly, along with the rest of White’s coaching staff, arrived at Pitt at the same time as Davis, in fall 2018. They’ve had to learn the ins and outs of campus life simultaneously. Now, as Davis prepares to graduate, she said Hoesly is taking an active role in teaching about how a college sports program is run. Davis hopes to attend graduate school after this year but college athletics is a career field she is interested in, so she’s trying to absorb all the knowledge that she can. “I forget sometimes that we are a business,” Davis said. “[Hoesly] oversees all the managers as well. She’s really helped me learn more about the business because I do want to work in college athletics and then also been there as a friend and a mentor.” During some of her limited spare time, Davis gets off campus to volunteer as a middle school mentor at the African American Achievement Trust, a branch of the Urban League of Pittsburgh, and Urban Impact as a basketball and soccer coach. Both are located in the Hill District, a predominantly Black neighborhood in Pittsburgh. With the AAAT, Davis mentors an eighth grader named Trinity, who she’s watched grow into a young woman over her time with the program. They talk about a range of things when together, anything from building self confidence, progress in school and Black history. “She’s amazing,” Davis said. “She is someone who really depends on relationships so I’ve tried to do a little bit more with her outside of the hour to two hours that we meet, … but while we’re in the session, we go over anything and everything.” Shannon watched Davis navigate a full course load on top of all of her extracurricular activities and claimed to have seen few, if any, signs of burnout. She said Davis just kept pushing, adding things to her already full days and weeks. But Davis is, of course, still human. She does get tired and overwhelmed at times. When she does need help, Davis turns to her support system, which is thankfully very large thanks to the depth and breadth of her involvement. But it is Davis’ sisters who are at her right hand the most, ready to overcome the distance between them with a text or phone call. Make no mistake though, Davis regrets nothing. It might not have been how she imagined her college experience unfolding — Davis said she didn’t even think she would end up at Pitt — but she wouldn’t change a thing. These are her choices and Davis is going to make the most of them during her final year in Oakland. “I didn’t plan on it at all,” Davis said. “At one point, I was working three jobs and I was like, ‘Oh no, we can’t do this.’ … But I don’t regret it at all. I’m so happy that I went fullthrottle, head in and tried everything because I definitely think that my outside the classroom experiences helped me inside the classroom and will help me in the professional world.” "" )",Hill District,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025

PN_HD30," ‘Making home here’ exhibit debuts quarantine inspired art at The Mattress Factory By Jessica McKenzie, Staff Writer Many people spent the majority of their time last year in their homes, just trying to get through each day as it came. But for the five local artists featured in The Mattress Factory’s newest exhibition, “making home here,” their homes came to life through the art they made while in quarantine. “Making home here” curator Sean Beauford said the concept for the exhibition came to fruition in the start of the COVID19 pandemic, when the exhibit curators were having a conversation with various artists on Zoom about what they were working on during lockdown. “Everyone kind of noticed that a lot of people were making Clare Sheedy | Senior Staff Photographer things that had to do with home already in some way,” “Making home here” debuted on Thursday night with a free community block Beauford said. “We met on Zoom, so we were really party, which included games of hopscotch, jump rope, a DJ and vegan food conscious of that — it’s like no one sees your home but still, trucks. your home is in the background in front of everybody.” “Making home here” is this year’s first inperson exhibition at The Mattress Factory, centering on themes of equity in the arts. The display debuted on Thursday night with a free community block party, which included games of hopscotch, jump rope, a DJ and vegan food trucks. The exhibit will run until late spring 2022. Beauford maintains a strong relationship with The Mattress Factory. Since 2017, he has curated art projects in multiple Pittsburgh museums such as The Andy Warhol Museum and the Carnegie Museum of Art. He said “making home here” was his first exhibit opening since the pandemic. “One of the things we were really mindful of when thinking of people seeing this in person is that they are able to engage with it,” Beauford said. “There were a lot of online exhibitions, but there’s something amazing about being able to see art in a physical space again.” One featured artist who particularly embraced audience engagement is Hill District resident Naomi Chambers, whose piece was a room designed to explore Black survival in the United States. The room was filled with remnants of a Black community’s ice cream social, tea party and oldfashioned cinema. Chambers encouraged attendees to contribute to her part of the exhibit by inviting them to put stickers on the wall. When examining the needs of Pittsburgh’s Black community, Chambers said she thought one of the things the community needs most is joy. “One of the things I always wanted to do as a kid was to sticker the walls,” Chambers said. “I figured out that a low stakes, fun way for people to get involved is stickers to add to the joy and to the fun.” Chambers said she started to think deeply about Black survival in America back in 2016, when she joined a community group centered on the fundamental needs of the Black community of Pittsburgh. Her piece came to fruition when she researched a Black Community Survival Conference that took place in the ‘70s. Her art piece was created to modernize that conference. "", ""“[The conference] held different events sickle cell anemia testing, voter registration different things that the Black community needed at the time,” Chambers said. “And so, this is my conference a tea party, ice cream social and cinema things that would bring us rest.” Chambers, a Pitt alumna, started out as an undecided major in the early 2000s and started taking art classes. Since then, she said she has embraced her outlandish ideas and turned them into thoughtprovoking art. “I had such a supportive group of artists at Pitt,” Chambers said. “I fell in love with the purpose of art.” Another Pittsburgh native, artist Justin Emmanuel Dumas, presented a piece made entirely of reclaimed architectural fragments such as railings, banisters, columns and window shutters. He said he aimed to tell a story through his architecture. “You can really read the surfaces around you and think there’s a narrative present in spaces with enough history,” Dumas said. “For this show, I was thinking about the perimeter between what is personal space and what is public space.” In Dumas’ room in the exhibit, there is a door’s threshold in the middle of the space, which he said he sees as the dividing line between personal and public space. Over the threshold is an archway which is made out of ballistic gel. Dumas said he wanted the archway not to be seen as an object that divides, but a membrane for the guest to pass through. “I really wanted to play on this tension of uncertainty about the future, but then also this call to adventure the desire to leave home and gather experiences and come back to that personal space,” Dumas said. “The movement through the room is moving out of your comfort zone and coming back and bringing more than you left with back to that personal space.” Beauford said that, above all, he was glad that “making home here” achieved reimagining The Mattress Factory as a domestic space. “I’m really proud of the artists for pushing themselves and producing truly thoughtful work,” Beauford said. “I’m also proud that the museum and the community was open to anything to support this project.” "" )",Hill District,art,2020-2025

Pitt will also invest $6 million in renovation and construction costs. Terms of the lease and the construction timeline are still being finalized in “ongoing discussions,” according to Pitt spokesperson Pat McMahon. The new CEC, as well as its sister site in Homewood, which opened in fall 2018, are part of Pitt’s Neighborhood Commitments, a University movement to improve engagement with local communities through longterm partnerships. The University is making a minimum 15year commitment to work with these communities on investment, infrastructure, programming and staff. David DeJong, the acting senior vice chancellor for business and operations, said the project would be a “catalytic community development investment in one of Pittsburgh’s most renowned AfricanAmerican communities.” Marimba Milliones, the president and CEO of HCDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committee also approved a fiveyear renewal of the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences’ lease for about 35,000 square feet of space at Bridgeside Point I. The lease will begin Oct. 1, 2021, with an initial annual base rent of $1,038,690 and annual 2% rent increases.

PN_HD32," ‘Until my last breath’: Dannielle Brown leads march across Pittsburgh college campuses By Ashton Crawley and Rebecca Johnson Dozens of voices chanting, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now. If we don’t get it? Shut it down!” to the beat of a drum and a blaring trumpet could be heard on an overcast Friday morning down Fifth and Forbes avenues across the City. One of these voices was Precious Melchizedek, a junior psychology major. She said Friday’s march across five Pittsburgh campuses led by Dannielle Brown was a perfect opportunity to support Brown, as well as hold Pitt accountable. “So many of these institutions claim they want to stand by us Sarah Cutshall | Visual Editor and they’re for the cause and they’re down to protect us, but After 70 days of her hunger strike, Dannielle Brown marched Friday look at us now,” Melchizedek said. “We’re on campus, where alongside Pittsburgh activists from Chatham University with stops at are you? No [Chancellor Patrick] Gallagher is present, but yet Carnegie Mellon University, Pitt and Carlow University before ending at they’ll go to the news and say that they support Black lives.” Duquesne University’s Brottier Hall to honor her son. Melchizedek was one of about 100 people who participated in Friday’s 40 for 40 march. The march — which took place on the 19th anniversary of 9/11 — commemorated the 40 people who lost their lives in Flight 93 in Shanksville, as well as the football jersey number of Brown’s son, Marquis Jaylen Brown. The march started at Chatham University and continued with stops at Carnegie Mellon University, Pitt and Carlow University before ending at Duquesne University’s Brottier Hall. Marquis Jaylen Brown, also known as JB, was a Duquesne student who died in October 2018. Dannielle Brown is currently on her 73rd day of a hunger strike as of Monday at the Hill District’s Freedom Corner, demanding an independent investigation into JB’s death from Duquesne as well as mandatory body cameras, mental health crisis training and deescalation training for university police. A man vandalized Freedom Corner on Friday night, following the protest. Brown said her advocacy is about protecting students from police brutality all across the country. “I’m going to make sure that every student, not only in the state of Pa., knows there’s a Mama Brown out here, laying down her life for all of you,” Brown said. “Until my last breath I will stand up and fight to make sure you all are safe and you all have a voice.” The march got pushback from Duquesne’s administration. In an email sent Friday at about 4 p.m. to all students, the university said it expressed “strong disapproval” of the march “trespassing” on private university property. “The crowd today chose to endanger thousands of people unnecessarily,” the email said. “They utilized bullhorns and microphones, disrupted classes and the work of students these protestors claim to value.” Duquesne also said in the email that it had been “extremely patient and accommodating” toward Brown. It also said protestors were not following COVID19 mitigation procedures, such as wearing a mask and social distancing, even though masks were required at the event and nearly all protesters wore one. Brown told a different story in a statement on her Instagram account later that night. She said the email sent after the march is another example of Duquesne not protecting its students and not taking meaningful steps to address concerns about her son’s death. "", ""“Duquesne still doesn’t have body cameras and has no intention of meeting my demands. The reality is they are taking your tuition money and disrespecting you guys in the process,” Brown said. “Duquesne, your true colors are showing, and I will keep exposing you!” The march did not attract police attention beyond street closures until it reached Brottier Hall, the building where JB died. While protesters were speaking outside the residence hall, what appeared to be a Duquesne student came out of the building wearing a President Donald Trump Tshirt and waving a Trump flag. While a few protestors initially rushed toward him, other protesters made a "", ""human wall in front of the student to protect him. Protest organizers said, “Leave it alone, he’s not worth it” and “stay back.” The man eventually went back inside the residence hall. After the student went inside, about six Duquesne police officers stood at the entrance of the residence hall and escorted other students who lived in the residence hall past protesters. "", ""Brown said after the incident that it is best to simply ignore “agitators.” “Don’t let people push your buttons,” Brown said. “How effective would it have been to not pay them any attention?” Mia Sterbini, a senior acting major at Point Park University, helped organize Friday’s event. Sterbini, who has been organizing with Brown since she started protesting, said Duquesne’s response to Brown is a failure. "", ""“All she really wants is answers for her son and Duquesne has been so difficult and barred her from any real progress,” Sterbini said. “It goes to show how wrapped up [Duquesne] is in their own publicity and image that they won’t even come talk to a grieving mother.” Sterbini added that she will not stop organizing until Brown gets answers. "", ""“We’re gonna be out here till the very end,” Sterbini said. “We want the lies to end. It’s been incredibly painful and terrible to watch the way they’ve ostracized this mother, who’s grieving the loss of her son, which was completely preventable and is completely on Duquesne’s hands.” "", ""While a large chunk of the march was spent at Duquesne, Brown had criticisms for Pitt as well. She commended Pitt for taking some action toward furthering racial justice on campus, such as Pitt police reforms and increasing mental health services for Black students. Brown said she wishes Pitt would give her more credit for coming up with many of the ideas. “They updated their website, they need to give me credit for that. They need to, at the very least, say thank you so we can let other schools know,” Brown said. “We need to let them know that because they’re doing pioneering work, give this mother her just due. I’m starving 70 days and to not get a thank you is really disheartening.” The Black Action Society and 17 other Black student organizations sent a list of more than 20 wideranging demands to the administration in late June. Pitt released its Antiracism, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan in midJuly. This plan incorporated many of the Black student organizations’ demands, even though officials said it wasn’t a formal response to the list. Some of the changes put in place include hiring more Black clinicians at the University Counseling Center, scheduling periodical meetings between senior administrators and Black student leaders, establishing antiracism training for employees and reforming policies within campus security and Pitt police. Brown said even though Pitt didn’t give her credit for its actions, she still has “unconditional love” for Pitt students, even those who didn’t participate in the march. She encouraged students to pressure Pitt’s administration to give her more credit and to invite her to speak on campus. “I want students to let the school know to show and practice a little more humbleness and sensitivity and honor and recognize the work that Mama Brown is doing to protect us,” Brown said. “Invite me to the classroom, I’ll come.” Melchizedek said she hopes more Pitt students and administrators will show up to support Brown in the future. “It is really heartbreaking to see that there aren’t more people here. Institutions saying, ‘Oh yes we stand, we stand,’ not one representative from the school, not one,” Melchizedek said. “To me, we have to get our voices heard sometime and I’m loud.” Melchizedek added that she sees a problem with schools, including Pitt and Duquesne, profiting off football players, but not doing enough to protect their lives. “It was a football player that passed away and these institutions thrive off the backs of our athletes and especially the football teams,” Melchizedek said. “Alumni gives money for football, but when someone dies no respect is given to that life.” Melchizedek wasn’t the only student who thought Pitt could do more to further racial equity on campus. Isabella Mahal, a Pitt sophomore political science major who attended the march, said she hopes Pitt takes comprehensive steps to protect Black students. She also said Pitt should reconsider many of the original demands from the BAS that it didn’t initially accept over the summer. “What’s important is moving beyond making statements and then writing it off as, ‘Oh we did our activism for the day or for the week or the year,’” Mahal said. “That’s where the frustration arises, when the University claims to support Black lives and does nothing to change their behavior.” Sterbini said Duquesne’s response to Brown is part of the larger issue of racism in America. She said while the Black Lives Matter movement has made progress, there is still much to accomplish. “This is truly just the beginning. I just want to remind especially young people that this is our fight and this is what our lives are going to look like,” Sterbini said. “We have a responsibility to help each other as a community. It’s going to be our world.” "", """", """")",Hill District,politics/activism,2020-2025
PN_HD33," ‘No way we can do this alone’: Panel uplifts local Black student leaders By Maura Scrabis, For The Pitt News For Morgan Ottley, a student leader at Pitt, advancing racial justice on campus is a collective effort. “One thing I always say is that there is strength in numbers,” Ottley, a senior neuroscience major, said. “Having spaces where large amounts of people can come together really builds community engagement and unity.” Collective action was one of the main themes at the Solidarity Town Hall held Saturday evening, where Black student leaders from colleges around the City came together Via Zoom to discuss racial equity on their respective campuses. Jasiri Black student leaders from colleges around Pittsburgh came together to X, the executive director and cofounder of 1Hood Media, discuss racial equity on their respective campuses. Jasiri X, the executive moderated the event. director and cofounder of 1Hood Media, moderated the event. Organizers dedicated a large portion of the event to Danielle Brown, the mother of Marquis Jaylen Brown. Brown is currently on the 58th day of her strike at the Hill District’s Freedom Corner in response to her son’s October 2018 death at Duquesne University. Brown joined the call from Washington, D.C., where she had taken part in the large rally for social justice on the 57th anniversary of the historic March on Washington. She mentioned repeatedly that her guiding force was the need for answers and justice and said the fight for justice is one that has continued since the moment she heard her son had passed away. “A lot was happening. A lot of questioning, a lot of waiting, a lot of suffocating, a lot of trying to put pieces together and not having the information,” Brown said. “The agony, the torture that goes on behind the scenes when you simply don’t know what happened to your child.” The frustration and anger was palpable, as she shared details of the night her son died. Brown said she empathizes with other mothers who have lost their sons. “There are a lot of grieving mothers out there, and it hasn’t let up since Jaylen,” Brown said. “Even starting with Antwon Rose, the killings have gotten worse and more public.” Ottley said she sees direct parallels between Brown’s calls for change at Duquesne University and demands that Pitt’s Black Action Society and 17 other Black student organizations sent to Pitt over the summer. The wideranging list of more than 20 demands touched on topics including amplifying the Black student voice, increasing the number of Black students and faculty, curriculum changes, additional training for employees and Pitt police reforms. Destiny Mann, a student leader at Pitt, said the groups have met with senior administrators and other professors, faculty and staff to figure out the changes necessary to make Black students feel safe and fairly treated. “We’ve been challenging the University to do better and have been engaging in multiple interviews, meetings and such so that this University knows that the Black student population is not happy,” Mann, a junior political science and Africana Studies double major, said. “We’re not going to quiet down until real change occurs.” Throughout the meeting, attendees sent in comments of support, as well as questions. Many wanted to know the ways they could help Brown’s cause and also continue to support her call to action in their own communities. In response, Brown shared pieces of advice — questioning narratives from institutions, being intentional in actions, using one’s economic power and being creative with actions. "", ""“As students, you all are freedom fighters,” Brown said. “You know your school environment, you know what you’re dealing with and you know what you can do.” Other universities across Pittsburgh are engaging in similar fights for racial justice. Kayla Harris, a student leader at Duquesne, said Black students struggle at Duquesne because the university is predominantly white. “It is very difficult to get minority students’ voices heard as well as amplified,” Harris said. In an effort to amplify minority students’ voices, Duquesne students are working on identifying and addressing issues on campus that affect all students, such as safe spaces and mental health resources. “We have a weekly session for minority students to come and basically be themselves, be vulnerable and share their experiences,” Darian Reynolds, a Duquesne student leader, said. “[The assistant director] is a Black male too, so that definitely helps us be able to talk about those things you normally wouldn’t talk about with anyone else.” Brown also said she encourages students to attend a Sept. 11 march she is organizing to connect students at all local universities. The march is planned to start at Carnegie Mellon University and collect students from each campus on a walk to Point State Park in Downtown. Along with marching, Ottley said showing up to events and listening to messages being shared is something all Pitt students should do. “I think attending events like this town hall, showing support, being present in the room says a lot more than people think,” Ottley said. “There’s no way we can do this alone.” A previous version of this story misspelled Darian Reynolds’ first name.

He cited the upcoming election year as a critical moment for women to affect change. “Women can decide this vote for who the next president of the United States will be, as well as votes that would bring change locally [and] statewide,” he said. “The entire balance of the supreme court is in jeopardy.” Peduto also spoke about September’s gender equity report, which demonstrates that gender discrimination is a real and quantitative issue in the City — as well as an area in need of work. With the creation of the Gender Equity Commission, Peduto said the City is taking steps to assure that women have equal access and opportunity within their community. Tracy Baton, founding organizer of Women’s March Pittsburgh and Pitt alumna, said she agrees with Peduto that Pittsburgh should be do more for black women living in the area. “Pittsburgh has turned out to be one of the worst places for black women to live in the United States, and we want to lift that up,” Baton said. “We want Pittsburgh to be a place that is hospitable to black women.” Baton, who grew up in the historic Hill District, has witnessed the mass exodus of black women living in the City. She recalls it being a vibrant and active place that is now mostly empty, as more individuals have moved to the suburbs due to a lack of affordable housing, among other issues. Baton feels that the march has shifted in purpose over the last four years. In addition to centering black women, march organizers have also focused on connecting people across communities and helping those involved to better understand the mechanics of voting and take activism to the polls. “We’ve been focusing on reaching out. We have a board member from Duquesne and a board member from Arnold, because we want to be more countywide and more inclusive because those black women whose lives we are trying to transform, they don’t live in the City anymore.” At the march, organizers handed out business cards containing QR codes linking to voter registration websites. Keeping with the theme of connection, cards were handed out in multiples so individuals who received them could pass them onto others. "", ""The demonstrators represented a wide variety of ages and backgrounds, including Jan Boyd, 70, of Aspinwall, who said she has been attending marches in support of women’s rights since she was a teenager. “I’m an old hippie from the ’60s, and I’ve been fighting for these things forever,” she said. “I’m now 70, and I’m still fighting.” Boyd said she’s been an “aggressive Democrat” since she started voting and that the presence of organizers and strong leaders tends to vary over the years. In recent years, Boyd said she’s noticed the presence of more young people attending rallies and demonstrations. A large number of students joined the march, including Faith Muse, a sophomore at the Community College of Allegheny County. This was Muse’s fourth time participating in a march, a pattern which began as recently as 2017, when she attended the first Women’s March with her grandmother in Washington, D.C. Due to weather conditions Saturday and her grandmother being sick, Muse said she considered not going to the march this year. However, she said that she decided to go in the end because the march was something she believed in. “I may be cold, but that didn’t stop me,” Muse said. Muse said the theme this year resonated with her own antiwar sentiments, despite having family members who have served. “It boggles my mind that we could send 17, 18yearolds, freshoutofhigh school kids to fight a war that we did not start.” Muse said. “I really hope they consider the fact that we are not the world’s police force.” Pitt firstyears Sierra Hellman and Molly Scheffler heard of the march through political organization NextGen, which organized a postermaking party for those who planned to attend. Though the rain smeared their signs, Hellman and Scheffler both said it was important to demonstrate with their fellow activists — especially in an election year. “It doesn’t matter what the weather is, you just have to stand for what you believe in,” Scheffler said. “You just have to vocalize what you believe in, and they’ll hear us. You just have to stand for it.” Of the various issues discussed at the march, Scheffler, a global management major, said she hoped to see improved policy surrounding abortion law and LGBTQ+ rights. Hellman, an undecided student in the business school, agreed with Scheffler and said she also supported an increase in free sanitary products for women. She added that voting is a key step in advancing policy toward these goals. “A lot of people nowadays are just like, ‘We don’t need to vote … we don’t really have an effect,’” Hellman said. “But I think we really do.” "" )",Hill District,politics/activism,2020-2025
PN_LV01," Local History Day showcases Pittsburgh’s past By Andrew McLaughlin, Staff Writer The third floor of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in Oakland opened for the first time since late 2021 on Saturday, Nov. 4. The reopening of the third floor coincided with the library’s Local History Day event, which brought 17 local exhibitors, including the Lawrenceville Historical Society and Rivers of Steel, together to share the city’s history with the public. Ed Simon, author of “An Alternative History of Pittsburgh,” gave an opening lecture at noon where he talked about littleknown aspects of Pittsburgh’s past that are covered in his book, including the city’s legacy as a jazz pioneer. Andrew McLaughlin | Staff Writer A sign welcomes event participants to Local History Day at the Carnegie “Many are not aware that Pittsburgh was one of the most Library of Pittsburgh in Oakland on Nov. 4. notable cities regarding its contribution to jazz,” Simon said. “Billy Strayhorn grew up in Pittsburgh to become a legendary jazz composer, yet he also lived a tragic life arranging for Duke Ellington.” Simon also emphasized that Pittsburgh history includes many nationally significant anecdotes. They range from Lawrenceville’s Allegheny Arsenal explosion in 1862 — the deadliest civilian disaster of the Civil War — to the B52 bomber that crashed into the Monongahela River in 1956 during the Cold War. “Many local stories in Pittsburgh history were also very much national stories,” Simon said. “For instance, Roberto Clemente transcended news in Pittsburgh with his death in a plane crash on the way to provide relief in Nicaragua.” Pittsburghbased archives, museums and historical societies were set up on the library’s second and third floors, and the library prepared book displays of local history titles for the occasion. Amanda Peters, archivist at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, said that Local History Day is a perfect way to celebrate the public reopening of the library’s Pennsylvania Department, which specializes in local history and genealogy research. “We hope that visitors see their community represented and realize that many different groups are working to preserve local history,” Peters said. Presenting at Local History Day was Historic Pittsburgh, the digital collection service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Library System. Home to more than 35,000 images, Historic Pittsburgh is a fantastic online resource for those wanting to learn more about local history, according to Megan Massanelli, engagement and outreach librarian with the library system’s Archives and Special Collections department. “Our mission is to preserve the history and culture of Western Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh more generally, but we’re not limited to that,” Massanelli said. “Our collections range from political science to performing arts, and no matter what your interests are, there’s always something in our collections.” The event also included two historical tours of the Carnegie Library in the afternoon, sharing how the library connects with Pittsburgh’s industrial past. The glass floors of the library’s stacks are made with slag, a byproduct of coal, and the stacks themselves were built with Carnegie steel. "", ""“The fact that Andrew Carnegie was a tremendous philanthropist but also an exploitative industrialist makes him a fascinating character,” Simon said. “Yet there has never been a great novel or movie about Carnegie.” The Pittsburgh City Archives presented several photographs of the Lower Hill District, which was completely demolished for the Civic Arena sports complex in the 1960s. Giving a rare snapshot into the predominantly AfricanAmerican Lower Hill before mass demolition, City Archivist Charles Succop said that the photographs will be part of a new website soon to be launched by the City Archives. “We’ve always had these records, but we are going to be making history more accessible through digitization,” Succop said. At another table, the Detre Library and Archives at the Heinz History Center shared a few images from their collection. Archivist Sierra Green reinforced that local history gives one a greater passion for their home. “We see this initiative and passion towards sourcing things locally, like purchasing from local artisans or farmers markets,” Green said. “Why not do that with history?” Green is currently working on a project to document Pittsburgh’s lost Chinatown, once located downtown between Grant and Ross Streets. “I’m currently working with two people who grew up in Chinatown, one of whom was the last unofficial mayor of the area,” Green said. “Hearing their memories directly and then seeing how they connect with primary sources is quite inspiring.” Pittsburgh’s legacy of immigration lives on throughout the city, including at St. Nicolas Church in Millvale, where the 25 Maxo Vanka Murals represent the faith of Croatian immigrants on a grand scale. Vanka was a Croatianborn artist, and the WWIIera murals were recently the recipient of a $471,670 grant to continue an ongoing conservation project. Pittsburgh history inevitably continues to influence the people and places of the city, according to James Morar, who volunteers with Rivers of Steel to preserve Pittsburgh’s industrial history. “Many local residents come from families whose ancestors worked long, grueling days in the steel mills, and we can repay that debt left to us by learning about their pasts,” Morar said.

PN_LV03," Upperclassmen offer advice to incoming firstyears By Carissa Canzona, Staff Writer As a new class of incoming firstyears prepare to move into their dorms, Staff Writer Carissa Canzona asked upperclassmen to share some of their experiences and biggest pieces of advice for students beginning their college journeys. What is your number one tip for balancing schoolwork and your social life? Anna McDermott, junior biomedical science major: Honestly, it’s really difficult and it took me the first two years of college to be able to get where I currently am. Don’t worry if it takes time to figure out… that’s what college is all about! My biggest recommendation would be to make sure you still have fun. Personally, being premed makes it too easy to get lost in schoolwork. However, you are not going to present your best in class if you don’t allow yourself to enjoy life along the way. Explore the city and set aside a few days a month for selfcare — it makes all the difference. Fikayomi Olagbami | Staff Illustrator Nicole Salkin, sophomore marketing major: My biggest tip for balancing school and a social life would be making sure all my work was done before the weekend so I could have those days to rest and socialize without worrying so much about schoolwork. Throughout the week, I would make sure to go study either alone or with friends from my classes, which helped a lot with balancing. Where is your favorite place on campus to study? Jamie Gilligan, sophomore nursing major: My favorite place on campus to study is the Quad because it gets me outside while still getting work done and is wellshaded enough so I can see my computer screen. Logan Skelly, junior human resources management major: Hillman ground/1st floor is the best, especially with the right people. McDermott: I personally love studying in Posvar Hall. Sometimes the library can get overwhelming so changing scenery is very helpful. I also love the Starbucks on Forbes for a darker environment! Where is your favorite place to go outside of campus? Skelly: Go to the West End Overlook! My favorite spot to look out into the city. McDermott: I love going to Lawrenceville for a nice night out. They have beautiful restaurants and a ton of ice cream joints along with a great lovely atmosphere. Another great area is the Waterfront, which has a ton of shops and restaurants to enjoy for the day. Salkin: Outside of campus, I loved going to the Roxian Theatre. They host a lot of events, like disco nights, and smaller artists have concerts there! What are some things you wish you knew before your first semester at Pitt? "", ""McDermott: I wish I knew that I wasn’t alone in the struggle between class and social life. Especially for me being seven hours from home, living on campus was a large shift in my life. Once you find the right people and immerse yourself in the amazing activities Pitt has to offer is when you really find yourself at home. It is not easy but it is 100% worth it. I wish I had someone to be there and tell me that they went through it too and that college is indeed so much different from high school. Sydney Gilmore, senior biological sciences major: I wish I knew more about the different extracurricular activities and opportunities offered on campus. Coming into college during the pandemic, I didn’t have a formal activities fair. If I were a freshman now, I would take advantage of that resource. Gilligan: Something I wish I was reminded of before coming to Pitt is remembering every student is in the same boat, so don’t be afraid to be the one to put yourself out there. Where are some of your favorite places to get food on campus? Gilligan: Other than ChickfilA, I love going to eat at Shake Smart and The Roost on campus. Shake Smart has smoothie bowls and protein shakes and The Roost has different types of chicken, so it is very similar to ChickfilA. Skelly: I eat True Burger almost every day, and don’t hate me, but I love The Eatery on special occasions with all my friends. McDermott: I love the sandwich shop in the [William Pitt] Union if you are going for an oncampus option. But if you are going for a nice dinner on Forbes my alltime fave would have to be Roots. It is a great option to get some healthy food into your system and fuel your brain for studying. But it is also delicious, literally addicting. Gilmore: I love Las Palmas on Atwood Street and Stack’d! If you could give your past self one piece of advice, what would it be? Gilligan: If I could give my past self advice it would be to join everything that looks interesting at the activity fair. Signing up for something does not mean that you have to keep showing up if you don’t like it. Salkin: One piece of advice I would give my past self is you do not need to rush into things. I often felt the need to have an established group of friends, find my roommates for next year, and have my career all picked out within the first weeks of school. But a lot of things can change in the duration of a year, and I wish I knew to take my time and not be as stressed as I was about the future. Gilmore: I would advise my past self to always make sure to take care of myself and my emotional wellbeing. Although college is tricky, you can find balance by surrounding yourself with a good support system. McDermott: Live a little. College is all about trying new things and learning from mistakes. If you don’t give yourself the space to grow, then you’ll stay where you’re currently at. Please take the time to immerse yourself in clubs and activities on campus. Go to the football games and make amazing memories because it all goes by way too fast. I found some of the most amazing people when I joined a sorority and immersed myself in a few clubs on campus. Don’t sell yourself short of amazing experiences! School is super important, but so is your mental health, so please take care of yourself while succeeding at your academic goals!

PN_LV04," Ruling Oakland’s bar scene with good vibes, teamwork: Phat Nguyen wins ‘Best Bartender’ By Jessica McKenzie, Culture Editor Students love partying at Phat’s Bar for its tasty Moscow mules, Instagrammable setting and crowded dance floor — but it’s largely the passionate staff that complete the atmosphere. Phat Nguyen, one of the bar’s owners and its namesake, won “Best Bartender” after students voted in The Pitt News’ annual “Best Of” survey. It’s Nguyen’s first time winning since the bar opened in January 2021, but he credits the bar’s success to the skills he learned from his brother, Phung Nguyen, nephew Andy Do and Roman Magolon, who is the general manager of Phat’s Bar. “We’ve always wanted to open a bar,” Nguyen said. “I’ve only Image courtesy of Phat Nguyen been bartending since we’ve opened this place. I learned what I know from Andy, and working around here all the time.” Phat Nguyen (left), bartender and owner of Phat’s in South Oakland. Do and Nguyen’s brother partner with him in owning and operating the bar. Do, who has worked as a bartender in various locations for about five years, moved to Pittsburgh when he discovered the opportunity to open Phat’s Bar. Nicknamed “Mr. Phat” by students and bar patrons, Nguyen also owns Ineffable Cà Phê in Lawrenceville. As an Indiana University of Pennsylvania alum, Nguyen said he’s always felt familiar with Pitt’s student body. “I feel like we have a great relationship with the students, they seem to have fun,” Nguyen said. “Our atmosphere really is geared towards students to see what they want and like.” Magolon, a senior business information systems major, said as a Pitt student, he tries to use his position as general manager to gauge what students enjoy. "", "" Phat Nguyen (left), bartender and owner of Phat’s in South Oakland. (Image courtesy of Phat Nguyen) “We try to cater to the students, make them feel like they can come here, have a good time and party. As a student myself, I love coming here with my friends,” Magolon said. “We also have events with all the frats and stuff. So the relationship with the students is pretty good.” With a strong social media presence, regular DJ nights, greenery covering the walls and a large neon pink sign in the back of the bar that reads “Be a badass with a Phat ass,” the bar has become exponentially more popular since opening. Do said he took a lot of decor inspiration from the nightlife in Atlanta, which is where he resided before moving to Pittsburgh. He added that the team added these details in an effort to help the Phat’s brand stand out, but also to make students feel welcome. “We’re just setting a vibe to where people feel they can be comfortable here and just have a good time and be safe too,” Do said. “Instead of just being like, ‘drink as much as you can,’ that’s not what we’re here for. We want everyone just to have a good time. At the end of the day, that’s how we view this bar.” One of Phat’s Bar’s signature drinks is Phat’s Bomb, a $6 shot that contains watermelon schnapps, blue curacao and Red Bull. Do said the shot is a specialty at the bar. “We don’t take ourselves too seriously. It’s one of the random drinks that we made up,” Do said. “I asked Phat what’s his favorite color, since the bar’s named after Phat. He said purple, and I was like, ‘Alright, great. I’m gonna make a drink that’s purple.’” While most of the bar’s drinks are named after Nguyen, bartenders can create their own cocktail and name it after themselves. Magolon’s $8 specialty drink is called “Roman Holiday” and contains vodka, lime juice, lemon juice, blue curacao and lime soda. Nguyen said he thinks Phat’s Bar stands out in Oakland because of its personable and positive bartenders. “Drinks, to be honest, sometimes can’t be perfect, but you pay for the experience,” Nguyen said. “You have someone to talk to, it’s just fun and by that time it’s just about having fun with someone. It’s not really the drink that stands out.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV05," Asian Student Alliance hosts annual culture fair By Anna Ligorio, For The Pitt News Floral umbrellas and vibrant red ribbons twirled in the air as performers from the Chinese American Student Association danced in the Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union. The room was filled with food, dancing and laughter at the annual Asian Student Alliance Culture Fair, held from noon2:30 p.m. on Saturday. The ASA is an umbrella organization that represents smaller Asian American student groups as a whole — their member organizations include the Chinese American Student Association, Filipino Students Association, Korean Student Association and the Vietnamese Student Association. About 13 different acts came together to showcase their talents onstage — including these groups, Romita Das | Staff Photographer other Pitt groups outside of ASA and a team from CMU. The Filipino Student Association performs “Hawak Kamay,” a Filipino pop song, during Saturday’s Asian Student Alliance Culture Fair. Performances went on for nearly two hours. With acoustic guitars and vocals, the Filipino Student Association performed a Filipino song called “Hawak Kamay,” which translates to “Holding Hands” in English. Additionally, the Vietnamese Student Association performed a couple’s dance and the Korean Student Association staged a KPop skit. Not only was there song and dance, but also instrumental performances. Borong Tsai played the guzheng, a traditional Chinese string instrument. According to Cynthia Truong, a sophomore chemistry major and the programming chair for ASA, Tsai’s skill with the instrument is monumental because he is the only person on campus who plays it. “He is a jewel in our community. I think he is the only person on our campus that plays the Guzheng,” Truong said. “He performed a song called ‘The Dance of the Yi,’ and he is absolutely phenomenal.” The diverse lineup was a standout part of the event, according to Josh Lee, a junior biological sciences and economics major and ASA vice president of internal affairs. Lee said even he wasn’t previously aware of some of the groups performing. “Not only is it awesome to see their great performances, but it’s also very culturally immersing,” Lee said. “They’re doing performances that are close to their hearts and it’s really cool to see the passion in them.” Along with the musical performances, ASA provided free food at the fair, which was catered by local Asian restaurants and Sodexo. Tables were filled with dishes from around the Asian continent. Each organization in ASA picked one dish that the group wanted to be represented at the fair. Lawrenceville restaurant Banh Mi and Ti provided Banh Mi, which are small Vietnamese sandwiches filled with savory ingredients such as meat and vegetables, while Oakland eatery Gold Palace Buffet provided the pork dumplings. Both performers and attendees took a break around 1 p.m. to sample the many varieties of food that every group had to offer. Truong said the event officially started two years ago and that every year the program has become increasingly complex. “I think this year we made it more of a show — last year it was in the Ballroom and there wasn’t a stage. Now it’s more of an event, in my opinion,” she said. “I think that me and our president, Sagar Rawal, wanted to emphasize and step up the grandeur of this event, which I think we achieved.” Megan Lee, an undecided firstyear, attended the fair with her friends. She said she is not a member of ASA, but attended the fair to appreciate her own Asian American heritage. "", ""“My favorite part of the event was learning more about my Asian culture and being around other Asian American people,” she said. The ASA Culture Fair is about representing and celebrating all groups of Asian descent, no matter how big or how small, according to Josh Lee. “There’s more to Asian Americans than just the dominant Eastern Asian cultures like China, Japan and Korea,” he said. “We want to introduce the idea that students of Southeast Asian culture and our fellow community of students can showcase their own talents.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025

PN_LV07," Pitt students search for Pittsburgh date spots this Valentine’s Day By Sarah Demchak, Staff Writer Romance, love and anxious crushes float throughout the Pittsburgh air this week with Valentine’s Day right around the corner. From quirky cafes and art museums to picnics and ice skating — Pittsburgh has a plethora of date spots for Pitt lovebirds. The Pittsburgh museums are free for students with their Panther card. For example, Pitt students can attend the Andy Warhol Museum, the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, the Mattress Factory and more free of charge. For those looking to save even more money and use their meal plan, there are many Oakland restaurants that accept dining dollars and Panther Funds. Oishii Bento, Pamela’s Diner and Romita Das | Senior Staff Photographer The Milkshake Factory are just a handful of options that take The Porch in Schenley Plaza. dining dollars. Cameron Chase, a junior environmental studies major, has taken advantage of student perks to save money on dates. She said her favorite date was going to Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens and eating at The Porch afterward. “One of my favorite date spots was going to Phipps just because it’s so close to campus, plus we get in free with our Pitt IDs, that made it super easy to even just go there with friends or a date,” Chase said. “After going to Phipps, I also went to The Porch, which was really good because their pizza is amazing — chef’s kiss.” Lauren Lussier, a junior chemistry major, also enjoyed Phipps and The Porch as date spots. She said the ideal location and the garden’s constant variety makes it a great place to visit. “Going to Phipps and walking around and then eating at The Porch or something a little more formal down in Oakland would definitely be my favorite because it’s simple and easy, especially for us because we can just walk there,” Lussier said. “It’s fun because Phipps is always so different every time you go, and it’s romantic because there’s so many flowers and there’s picture spots.” Running with the broke college student trope, Oakland offers pretty areas to simply meander around with a date, according to Gileanna Ortiz, a junior chemistry major. Schenley Park has miles of hiking trails to explore for those looking for an active excursion. The Cathedral lawn holds lots of potential too. Lussier said one of her favorite dates was a picnic in front of Cathy. “I’ve had someone do a picnic for me outside of Cathy once — that was cute,” Lussier said. “He got food from The Porch and we sat on a blanket outside of Cathy and had a picnic. I think the picnic on Cathy lawn is really sweet because it’s really romantic. You can dress it up or dress it down depending on what you want to do with it.” Venturing outside of Oakland, there are many other date spots in Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods, such as Lawrenceville, Downtown, the Strip District, South Side and North Shore. Ortiz enjoyed visiting Lawrenceville with her date because there is a lot to explore. “Lawrenceville has a lot of really nice things,” Ortiz said. “We just walked down Butler Street, looked at all the cute shops, got lunch and played pinball at Kickback Pinball Cafe.” Sports fans can take their dates to see the Steelers, the Penguins or the Riverhounds. Heinz Field is located in the North Shore, the PPG Paints Arena is in Downtown and Highmark Stadium is located in the South Side. "", ""Lussier enjoyed attending a Riverhounds game. The Pittsburgh’s soccer team’s stadium is located near the Monongahela Incline. Both Chase and Lussier enjoyed taking the Monongahela Incline up to Mount Washington, remarking on its iconic picture spots and pretty views. Lussier said the restaurants in Mount Washington are quite expensive, but there are some dessert shops up there that college students can still enjoy. “It’s kind of fun to just walk around up there and look at the restaurants,” Lussier said. “There are crepe places and ice cream places that you can stand outside and eat, I think that’s cute.” For those looking for more adventure, head Downtown to go ice skating at the Ice Rink at PPG Place. With a Pitt ID, students can skate for $5.50 on Wednesdays. Ortiz said this date was a little tricky with all the slips and falls, but ultimately was a great time. “We went ice skating, which was a little hard, but also really fun,” Ortiz said. “Yeah, we may have slipped a bunch of times, but we also laughed so much that day.” Located in the Strip District, Coop de Ville offers Southern food, drinks, bowling, classic arcade games, pinball machines and pool tables. Ortiz has not been here, but has only heard great things. She said it sounds like an exciting place to go with a date because it has so much to offer. “I would like to go to Coop de Ville because I heard that it is really fun,” Ortiz said. “It sounds like there is no way someone could get bored there with all the games you can play.” Pittsburgh has so much to offer students this Valentine’s Day and throughout the semester, according to Chase. She encourages students to get out and explore the City with someone they love. Chase said they should find time out of their busy school schedules to really enjoy a nice date in the City. “You’re not just sitting in the library doing work together or doing some club activity that you’re both in together,” Chase said. “You are getting out, exploring and doing something different.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV08," In case you missed it: News from winter break 2021 By Natalie Frank, News Editor Despite Pitt’s desolate campus after students flocked home for winter break, there was no shortage of action in the Oakland area. Here’s a roundup of news you may have missed over break. Food service company files lawsuit against Pitt for breach of contract Sodexo Operations LLC, Pitt’s former food service provider, filed a more than $7 million lawsuit against the University in federal court on Dec. 23. The lawsuit claims that Pitt failed to honor its contracts with Sodexo by directing the company to prepare food and have employees ready for Pitt’s entire TPN File Photo student body to be back on both the Oakland and Johnstown The entrance to The Eatery in Litchfield Towers. campuses after spring break in March 2020. The University ultimately sent all students home due to the start of the COVID19 pandemic. Sodexo is suing Pitt on three counts of breach of contract and one count of unjust enrichment. According to the lawsuit, the number of students expected to return to campus in March 2020 changed from 4,000 to 1,500, and then to 200. Due to the lack of knowledge surrounding how many students would be returning to campus, the lawsuit alleges that “Sodexo incurred millions of dollars in additional inventory and labor charges for which [Pitt] has refused to reimburse or otherwise compensate Sodexo, despite numerous requests.” According to the Pittsburgh PostGazette, the food service company believed Pitt would compensate them for more than $5.5 million in labor and materials costs from stocking the Oakland and Johnstown campuses during March 2020, but the University did not. A University spokesperson declined The Pitt News’ request to comment on the pending litigation. According to the suit, Sodexo also signed a contract with Pitt in 2017 to help renovate and improve the dining areas in the Oakland campus. Sodexo’s monetary contributions to the project would total more than $4.8 million paid in three installments over three years. However, Pitt halted the renovation efforts when students shifted to online classes in spring 2020. Sodexo also alleged that Pitt owes it $75,000 for an equipment fund, $23,186 in catering deposits and $106,198 in maintenance billing. Sodexo had been Pitt’s longtime dining contractor before the University started a new contract with Compass Group on July 1, 2020.

Pitt hosts Christmas Day volunteer event after cancellation last year due to COVID19 Around 200 volunteers gathered on Dec. 25 to help distribute winter gear, meals and presents for those across the City who may not have been able to celebrate as part of “Christmas Day at Pitt.” The Office of Engagement and Community Affairs led the event, which Pitt cancelled last year due to the COVID19 pandemic. OPDC discusses inclusionary zoning, crime and ‘problem properties’ The Oakland Planning and Development Corp. held its monthly “Let’s Talk/Oakwatch” meeting over Zoom on Dec. 15 to discuss inclusionary zoning — encouraging or requiring developers to make a certain percentage of units affordable to lowincome households — in other neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, such as Lawrenceville, and how inclusionary zoning can be implemented in Oakland. Dave Breingan, executive director of Lawrenceville United, provided background information on inclusionary zoning in Lawrenceville and Randy Sargent, a member of the South Oakland Neighborhood Group, discussed displacement and gentrification in Oakland. Attendees also posed questions to the presenters regarding inclusionary zoning in Oakland. During the Oakwatch portion of the monthly meeting, Elena Zaitsoff, chairperson of Oakwatch, announced that the City Council passed changes to the Residential Parking Permit program discussed at a Nov. 17 OPDC meeting. Lizabeth Gray, neighborhood quality consultant, discussed “problem properties” in Oakland and how they are being managed. Gray also updated attendees about crime in the Oakland area. Gray said Pitt and City police are starting an arson investigation into a couch that was set on fire after Pitt won the ACC football championship game on Dec. 4. OPDC discusses The Porch renovations, CMU institutional master plan Owners of The Porch at Schenley Plaza discussed a proposal to cover the restaurant’s outdoor patio, and build a small greenhouse for herbs and vegetables, at an OPDC meeting on Dec. 13. Representatives from nearby Carnegie Mellon University also presented the latest version of the university’s Institutional Master Plan, which it hoped to finalize and submit to the City Planning Commission by the end of December. City pushing Bates Street upgrades for better access to Hazelwood Green development Local officials are pushing for improvements to Bates Street and additional ramps from Parkway East in Oakland to allow for better access to the Hazelwood Green development. According to the Pittsburgh PostGazette, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is looking to use federal infrastructure funds for two projects in the area — widening Bates Street from two lanes to four between Route 885/Boulevard of the Allies in Oakland and Second Avenue in Hazelwood, as well as adding an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance to the Parkway East from the Bates Street area.

PN_LV09," Pitt students buy used furniture to save money By Sarah Demchak, Staff Writer Students are already looking for offcampus living for the next academic year, and furniture shopping can get expensive. Luckily, there are various options students can use to make their apartments cute on a budget. Hannah Moore, a senior molecular biology major, said the first place to look is the basements of their parents or other family members. She said her family saved their couches over the years — despite their battered states — for the sole purpose of filling her future college apartment. “The couches both came from my family,” Moore said. “We’ve just been collecting furniture for years. Whenever a friend was giving it away or we bought new furniture because ours was really run down, I would tell my parents to save it for me because I don’t care if it has rips if I’m in college.” Many students may get lucky and find free furniture already in their apartments or outside on the street, according to Moore. She said she found a couple of pieces while moving into her apartment in Pittsburgh. “Our table, we just inherited in our apartment. It was here when we moved in, and we just kept it because it’s big and nice,” Moore said. “The coffee table, we actually just found on the street when we moved in as well. So those are both used as well from other students.” Friends and fellow students may have furniture options if their family basements are empty. Caroline Weiss’ friends gave her a desk and chair for free. Weiss, a senior environmental studies and political science double major, also utilized the Pitt Class of 2023 Facebook page to find her bed at a decent price in Pittsburgh. “I would recommend Facebook Marketplace, and I even just use our class’ Facebook page,” Weiss said. “I saw that someone posted their bed there and was like, ‘Oh, that’s a really good price and then I won’t have to transport it across the state.’ So I just went with that and would definitely advise other students to do the same.” Other online platforms such as OfferUp and Craigslist also sell budgetfriendly furniture. These virtual programs allow people to buy and sell items to other users, like digital furniture thrifting. Buyers can set price ranges, location preferences and category options to find exactly what they are looking for. Juin Sommer, a junior computer engineering major, has used these platforms many times to find furniture. For example, Sommer purchased a large sectional couch on Facebook Marketplace for $200. He said he recommends using online exchanges if students cannot find free furniture. “Look for free stuff first, like friends or family that are giving away furniture,” Sommer said. “And then cheaper places like on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist or OfferUp — a lot of people do it online trying to get rid of old furniture.” Students can also try used furniture stores. Pittsburgh Furniture Company offers a plethora of used furniture options for students. Located in Lawrenceville, this store sells durable, reasonably priced midcentury modern furniture, according to Danni Lee, the company’s manager. The company buys furniture through online auctions, local thrift stores, estate sales and through local sellers. These purchased pieces get refinished if they are damaged by one of the store’s three employees. "", ""Lee said they value fairness when it comes to their prices, which is possible because of the store’s constant flux of furniture. She said their prices are generally half of the topmarket value with an additional 20% off. Customers can buy a coffee table for $45 or $900. “We also just try to be reasonable because we just move furniture so quickly. Almost every two weeks the whole store is all new,” Lee said. “We always just try to keep our prices reasonable too because we’re not trying to get rich — we’re just trying to help people honestly.” Lee said their delivery service is also cheap and can help students easily transfer furniture into their apartments. “It’s usually about $20 to $40. It depends how far away people are. $40 is usually South Hills, but if you’re really close, like Oakland, it’s just $20,” Lee said. “And then they put it in the room you want it in too. A lot of other delivery services, they just leave it at the curb.” According to Lee, about 45% of their customers are students, so they offer resale services. Students can buy a piece and sell it back to the company once they finish college. Lee said their furniture is durable, allowing for a good resale price. “Sometimes you can even sell it online, like on Facebook Marketplace people are selling the same exact piece of furniture we have here for more. It’s insane. It’s absolutely insane,” Lee said. “Midcentury furniture holds its value really well. It’s just really good quality.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV10," Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks announces ‘Cymbeline’ for 16th season By MJ LaRocque, Staff Writer Two women stood in the middle of a bar playing an improv game where they created a new Shakespeare play they called “The Sisters of Atalanta.” The two acted as a father and his boss, trying to reach a marriage agreement between the man’s daughter and a pile of sand. The theatrics were part of Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks’ Valentine’s improv game night in Bloomfield last Tuesday. Celebrating its 16th season in 2020, the organization performs Shakespeare for free in City parks, including Schenley Park in Oakland, Arsenal Park in Lawrenceville and Frick Park in Squirrel Hill. Each autumn since 2005, the company presents one play during four Courtesy of Catherine Aceto September weekend afternoons. The Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Park group stages an improv performance called “Sister’s of Atlanta.” The goal of Tuesday night’s fundraising event was to create a Shakespeareanstyle comedy by marrying two characters at the end. To win the game that night, judges awarded points for crossdressing, giving a good aside and declaring a toast among others actions characteristic of Shakespeare’s comedies. But before the games began, Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks founder Jennifer Tober kicked off the evening by announcing their fall show, “Cymbeline.” According to the Royal Shakespeare Company, “Cymbeline” is set in Britain on the brink of disaster. Its queen, Cymbeline, is at her wits’ end after the death of her children, while the only heir, Innogen, marries her love, Posthumus, in secret. A powerhungry figure plots for the murder of the queen and heir. Posthumus is exiled and schemes to have Innogen murdered. Innogen discovers these plots and disguises herself as a man fleeing Queen Cymbeline’s court. Jonathon Dreatr, a 1991 Pitt alum, attended PSiP’s event as a lover of Shakespeare after studying theater arts. He said he has gone to PSiP productions in the past and loves what the actors can do with a script. However, he was especially excited to see what they could do without one Tuesday night. “I came because these are all really good actors and I like to see them do improv,” he said. “Because usually you see them doing Shakespeare and now they get to play with that idea and show off their acting skills, which is very entertaining.” When Tober founded Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks in 2005, she said she started the company not because there was a lack of Shakespeare in the area but simply because it’s what she wanted to do. Tober said she wanted her work to be something she loved so she decided to start a company that would perform Shakespeare for free. “As a producer and the artistic director, I really want to level the playing field to make more equality for our audiences,” she said. “Theater is not just something rich people can go to and that you can do theater and you can enjoy theater anywhere at any time.” This year’s stage director is Jeffery Chips, 36, who has worked as an actor and director for PSiP on and off since 2006. In the past 15 years, Jeffrey has performed, directed and/or produced 30 productions of Shakespeare’s plays. He said he is thrilled to return to PSiP and finds Shakespeare’s work as literature that needs to be performed, not merely admired. “I approach Shakespeare in general as something that is very urgent,” he said. “It’s not something you put on a mantel and admire, it’s not a museum piece.” "", ""Looking back to when he first saw a performance of “Cymbeline,” Chips said he finds it to contain a multitude of disjointed scenes, to the point where it is difficult to recall the entire plot because so much is happening at any given time. As the director, he said he plans to bring these elements together to challenge the notion of what a happy ending by Shakespeare looks like. “[‘Cymbeline’ is] really kind of full of conflict, full of emotion and full of extraordinary challenges that people are going through,” he said. “Every moment that any character is on stage there is a sense of life or death stakes.” Among one of the only nonPSiP members, Nathaniel Brodsky, 24, from Shadyside went to PSiP’s event because he likes Shakespeare, though he was unaware that they would be announcing their fall show. He knows little about “Cymbeline” but described the play as a different kind of Shakespeare. “Jealous lovers, a Roman god randomly appearing on the stage, a girl dressed as a boy, dying and coming back to life, thinking her husband is dead and realizing he’s not dead,” he said. “Lots of weird Shakespearian things.” In order to keep their performances free, PSiP does a series of events throughout the year. One such fundraiser is the celebration of Shakespeare’s birthday for a week in April. The festivities begin on Sunday, April 19, with a tribute from Mrs. Shakespeare, performed by 1989 Pitt alum Yvonne Hudson, at the Shakespeare Statue on Forbes Avenue. Following her tribute, there will be a celebration under Schenley Plaza Tent with birthday cake and a microphone for people to recite Shakespeare. Last year’s fundraising went to producing an allfemale version of “Julius Caesar” last summer. Harper York, 41, a Lawrenceville resident, acted with PSiP for the first time during their 15th season as part of that production of Julius Caesar. York said that when she moved to Pittsburgh six years ago, PSiP was still fairly new and she was starting her own company, Pittsburgh Classic Players, in Hazelwood. York said she joined PSiP because she wanted to support other actors. “That’s what I love about being an actor, is being part of [a group],” she said. “So when I come to actual performances and rehearsals, anything I can do to support the other people, even if it’s not my own character work, is something I really love.” Though the plays take place outdoors, preparing for them is no walk in the park, according to Sharon McCune, 49 of South Hills. McCune, who first performed with PSiP in “Julius Caesar,” said she was particularly surprised by the emotional toll of playing a male character. “The mental exhaustion that came with doing that play, I was not prepared for. Because even if you have a lead … it still did not occur to me the emotional toll it would take,” McCune said. “Most of the time, and we all know this, women don’t have parts like that, we don’t have a Hamlet.” McCune, who also was a part of an allfemale production of “The Tempest” in 2019, said she was surprised at how popular allfemale casts have become recently. According to McCune, women have always been actors, but only getting recognition now because they are playing male parts. “I get it but I don’t get it. Why is it such a big deal that it’s all female? So what?” McCune said. “We don’t go off the deep end when it’s an all male show because they’re almost always all male. So who cares? Why is it such a huge deal? Women are suddenly playing Othello and Caesar and Prospero and Hamlet, so what?” "" )",Lawrenceville,event,2020-2025
PN_LV11," Satire | Five tips for making the most of Pitt’s campus By Julia Kreutzer, Senior Staff Columnist There’s nothing like a pandemic trapping us inside for over a year to make us cherish the amenities of an oncampus, inperson academic experience. As a member of the only remaining class who has experienced a full year on campus, here is my definitive guide to making the most of your time here. The best place to cry on campus is the Frick Fine Arts Atrium Clare Sheedy | Staff Photographer The transition from high school to college is often one fraught with stress, anxiety and worry. For those afternoons when you’ve just failed your first exam, miss your parents or are fed up with eating the same stir fry from Market for two weeks straight, the Frick Fine Arts Atrium is your best friend. Rather than breaking down in front of your roommate — who is likely some stranger from “outside of Philly” that you met on Facebook — why not shed your tears surrounded by picturesque gardens, beautiful architecture and a sole studio arts student walking back from class? This building is often pretty empty, since it is set apart from the rest of campus by Schenley Plaza. And as a bonus, on your way back to your dorm you can stop by Asia Tea House to cry into some $4 sushi. Bagels from Benedum or Posvar? Choose your fighter. This may be the most controversial statement I’ve made to date in my time at The Pitt News. The Einstein Bros. Bagels in Benedum Hall is better than the one in Posvar Hall. Both take dining dollars, both serve a delicious plain toasted bagel with cream cheese and yet only one serves specialty coffee drinks to get you through the required collegiate algebra class that nearly took me out during my first year. Even if you’re one of the lucky ones that never has to set foot in Benedum Hall, I’d venture to say that the bagels and drinks are worth the trek up the hill. "", ""Beware the buses Picture this. You’re late to class. It’s a normal Thursday morning in Pittsburgh, which means the sky is the color of coal and it’s thunderstorming. You’re running down Fifth Avenue, dodging pigeons and Pathfinder tours. Suddenly, you see it. But it’s too late. A giant red bus is plummeting down what you formerly believed to be a oneway street, on course for a pothole filled to the brim with murky water and a single Five Guys receipt. Before you can leap out of the way, a tsunami of gray water crashes on the sidewalk. You cannot escape. I’ve spent many morning recitations wringing out my jeans in a Cathedral bathroom after being the victim of a Port Authority soaking. Beware of your surroundings. Hillman naps are a thing Finals week is a special breed of brutal. Hillman library fills up quickly and chaotically, bursting with sleepdeprived students running on dining hall coffee. Securing a table is a noble feat, not to mention the pride one feels being able to hang on to this prime real estate for the entire day. For those midday slumps when giving up a table to make the cold, dark trek back to the dorm feels impossible, taking a 20minute power nap in Hillman is not only acceptable, but I’d go as far as to say it is encouraged. Don’t be afraid to leave Oakland Don’t get me wrong, Oakland is great. I love the restaurants, green spaces and, of course, Miss Cathy. But my affinity for the Steel City increased exponentially once I worked up the courage to venture to another one of Pittsburgh’s 90 different neighborhoods. Shadyside and South Side are prime destinations for shopping and restaurants. Lawrenceville has everything from bowling to an old church where you can get pierogies and beer. Downtown has the best views of Pittsburgh’s beautiful stadiums in the North Shore and worldrenowned theatres where you can use your Pitt ID to get discounted tickets to all kinds of live events. By far the cheapest and easiest way to get around the city is using your Pitt ID and the Transit app to get free, simple transportation to any neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

PN_LV12," ‘Finding that joy in their life again’: Student org helps traumatic brain injury patient By Katie Cassidy, Staff Writer For people who experience traumatic brain injuries, their lives are dramatically and permanently impacted. Pitt Synapse aims to support these individuals as much as possible as they begin their TBI recovery journeys. Pitt Synapse is the University’s chapter of Synapse National, a national nonprofit organization that focuses on raising public awareness about TBIs and providing resources for people dealing with TBIs. The organization hopes to eliminate the stigma surrounding TBIs by providing educational resources to the general public and increasing their knowledge on the depth and complexity of the injuries. Synapse National has chapters at 18 universities around the United States, each founded by undergraduate students at those schools. Abigail Skeel, a junior history of art and architecture major, said Synapse National was still relatively small in 2019 and only had chapters at MIT and Stanford. Skeel said students wanted to start a group at Pitt in order to contribute to Synapse National’s goal of removing stigma around TBIs. Nishant Agrawal founded Pitt’s chapter of Synapse National in 2019. Skeel said she and Agrawal started by working with patients at UPMC Children’s Hospital in Lawrenceville and mentoring TBI students in the BrainSTEPS program. Image courtesy of Abigail Skeel “The whole idea of Synapse is to reduce the stigma of traumatic brain injuries and to offer programs to people in the Abigail Skeel is a junior history of art and architecture major. community who have undergone TBIs, such as support groups and buddy programs,” Skeel said. “At Pitt, we are glad to be a part of the larger organization.” Skeel took over as the organization’s president when Agrawal graduated last December and is now in charge of all operations, such as the buddy program and guest speaker events. She said her main goal now is seeing the group grow so members and the community alike can learn more about TBIs. “We have a program at the Children’s Hospital where our students can go and visit children in both the trauma units and the neurological surgery and neurology units and offer support through mentoring and tutoring,” Skeel said. “Our work with BrainSTEPS is more of a oneonone partnership between students and kids. We also offer a lot of speaker events for members to educate themselves.” Pitt Synapse has six members on its executive board and about 30 members total. Vaish Bandari, a senior neuroscience major, serves as the organization’s vice president of general operation for the 202021 academic year. Bandari said she got involved her junior year with Synapse, and that the opportunities and her personal connection to TBIs drew her to the club. "", ""“I was a neuroscience major and someone who actually works in a research lab studying TBIs, trying to mitigate the effects of TBIs, so I thought it would be really cool to be a part of it,” Bandari said. “The club was just starting out, but it had a lot of interesting opportunities.” As VP of general operations, Bandari runs the buddy program, where club members can match with patients recovering from TBIs in the UPMC Children’s Hospital. Bandari said the program helps members get more comfortable discussing TBIs and interacting with people with TBIs. She said her favorite part of the club is helping people learn about TBIs and working to reduce the stigma. “I think a lot of people just don’t really understand TBIs. It is such a general term, but each one is unique,” Bandari said. “I think being a part of the club has opened my eyes to that, and helping other people become more aware of that is a really cool thing.” Elisha Sidhu, a sophomore english writing and communications major, joined Synapse at the start of the fall term and became the organization’s director of technology and marketing. Sidhu is in charge of creating graphics and running the club’s social media account. She said it is “one of the most meaningful experiences” she has been a part of, even though she is not prehealth or involved with any STEM field. “Pitt Synapse is so unique compared to other prehealth clubs at Pitt. I was so drawn to it because of my understanding of how isolating it can be going through TBIs. People can’t see the injury itself and might have a hard time empathizing with it,” Sidhu said. “It is a big goal of mine to get this club out there, creating social media posts, creating graphics that educate about TBIs.” The pandemic halted Synapse’s inperson mentoring at Children’s Hospital. Skeel said their virtual programs, on the other hand, have been amping up and actually make it easier to reach the patients. She said she can see the kids making improvements, even if it is over Zoom, and recalls one boy in particular. “He was actually one of our first children who joined the program,” Skeel said. “He loves drawing, loves painting, and every time he goes on his Zoom call, that is one of the first things he asks to do. We’ll have little software programs where he can draw virtually and you can just see his eyes light up. That is a great moment to see.” Skeel said she hopes to be involved with Synapse for as long as possible because she believes in the club’s purpose and wants to continue helping as many recovering TBI patients as she can. She said Pitt Synapse is based on longevity and aims to be a constant touchpoint for patients as they begin difficult TBI recovery journeys. “All of a sudden they are brought into this entire new world where they have to learn to cope and to be able to recover. It is a long haul, unfortunately, but we try to help them through that journey,” Skeel said. “The thing I enjoy the most is being able to see their confidence grow. Seeing them become more outgoing, finding that joy in their life again.” This article has been updated to reflect who founded Pitt Synapse. "" )",Lawrenceville,UPMC hospital,2020-2025
PN_LV13," Opinion | Top 10 things I will miss about Pittsburgh By Alex Dolinger, Senior Staff Columnist Pittsburgh has been a part of my life for many years now. I have fond memories of going to weddings at Soldiers and Sailors as a kid and the inclement weather that always made the weddings suck. I have no idea how long I’ve been enjoying all the splendor Pittsburgh has to offer, but I do know that I’m saying farewell to this cruel mistress of a city at the end of the summer, and I’m heartbroken. It’s pretty surreal, but I’m graduating college next week. It feels absolutely fake, especially because I still don’t even know what homecoming is. I’m so excited to go spread my immense and bizarre knowledge with the unsuspecting citizens of Buffalo, NY, through the City Year program, but Alanna Reid | Staff Photographer saying goodbye to Pittsburgh is going to be a huge bummer. Alex Dolinger will miss the Port Authority buses. Pittsburgh is special. She is not like other girls. Thus, here are the top 10 things I’ll miss the most about her. Lawrenceville dogs I’ve been blessed to spend time in most of Pittsburgh’s lovely neighborhoods, and I’ve noticed something delightful about one of them. Lawrenceville is just filled to the brim with adorable dogs. I love dogs. The people who walk the dogs always see me fawning over the dogs and bring them over to me for some pats. It’s amazing. I think I’ve mostly met doodles in what I call ‘Larryville,’ which is unsurprising because you can also make candles and purchase rolled ice cream. You get it. My favorite dog that I met in Larryville was a greyhound named Hank. Hank, if you’re reading this, don’t forget me. Themed PAT busses Port Authority and I are like lovers on “The L Word.” She is constantly leaving me out in the cold, both emotionally and literally, but I keep coming back for more. She also connects me with some of the strangest people I have ever met in my life, if only for a moment. Despite the raw fury I have felt every time I realize I am waiting for a 54 that is simply never coming, I soften immediately once I see a 71 that is covered in little hearts. I love art just as much as I love public transit, and despite the fact that I know it’s a silly little capitalistic venture, I fall prey to the pride busses every time. I think, “how nice!” and then I text the same thing to my mom. Colorful locals I have had some of the most impactful interactions of my life on the sidewalk after 8 p.m. I have a denim jacket with a rainbow that I painted on the back, and a girl that I had never met before came up to me while I was waiting for a bus and had a 15minute conversation with me about how I should start an Etsy shop. I also once had to tell a woman that her boobs had fallen completely out of the underboob cutout in her dress, and she looked me in the eyes and said “YOLO.” Honorable mention to the man who yelled at me out his car window just to say “I see your soul.” I’m gonna miss that. Milkshakes I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Pittsburgh is full of delicious milkshakes. We’ve got The Milkshake Factory, Stack’d, Fudge Farm, Burgatory, Five Guys and probably a bunch of other ones that I can’t remember. There are milkshakes everywhere. And they’re all pretty different from each other? Somehow? It’s my dream come true. I am a boy and I have come to the yard. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Sorrento’s "", ""Sorrento’s and I go way back. On my 19th birthday, I told my friends that all I wanted was to go to Sorrento’s and take pictures in front of the Oakland mural, and I do not regret that for a second. Sorrento’s was my goto depression meal for an entire year. That ranch got me through some of the worst moments of my life, like the time I slipped on ice and fell all the way down Bates Hill in front of someone and their parents and they laughed at me. The recipe has changed now, but so have I, you know? It’s like we changed together. Now I’m 22 and Sorrento’s is finally on UberEats. It’s all very profound. Puccini’s One of Sorrento’s neighbors also got me through many tough times. Puccini Hair Design has turned all of my bad hair decisions into good ones. They gave me my first pixie cut, making my butch lesbian dreams a reality. Then, I dyed that pixie cut orange because I was beginning my quarterlife crisis. I hated it so much that I cried in the Posvar hall bathroom — the best place to cry on campus — and then Puccini’s managed to bleach it all out without all of my hair snapping off. They also did not make me feel like an idiot, even though I was and still am. Everyone there is so nice and I would trust them with my life, because I already trusted them to give me an undercut. That’s real. Multiple Targets I can’t adequately explain to you why this makes me so happy. It’s just so nice to have multiple dollar sections. Multiple sets of cashiers who have to see me at my worst. Multiple chances to look for Squishmallows that I don’t actually want but still search for every time. Plus, I can get to all of these Targets on PAT buses, which means that I have multiple chances to actually ride the one that’s covered in little hearts. I just think it’s neat. South Oakland architecture I’m a design student, so I’m constantly noticing the good designs that are all around us all the time. Like themed PAT busses. However, I also notice the bad designs. Like most South Oakland apartments. It’s not even that the houses are ugly, they are just confusing. There are two houses across the street from me that are not connected, but they are literally two inches apart from each other. Why? There’s also some duplex situations but each side of the house looks completely different. What went into that choice? I love the hodgepodge of houses and all the broken glass that surrounds them, but I would just like to see the research photos. The Cathedral basement Speaking of being a design student, most of that work has taken place in the basement of the Cathedral. Not floor G, with the Starbucks and oddly configured hallways, but the floor below it, where several construction shops, a theater and sometimes some birds live. The basement was my own little private oasis where I got to paint and burn myself with hot glue alongside some of my closest friends and favorite faculty. No one else seems to know it exists, except for the random people who sometimes show up and ask to sit in the theater in the middle of the day. And the birds. Somehow birds get in there a lot. On a more serious note, that place and the people who frequent it have truly made these last four years the best of my life, and there’s no one else I’d rather dodge birds with. The Pitt News This one hurts. I’ve had a long and happy career writing nonsense with some of the kindest and most intelligent people I have ever met. This is my last Pitt News column, and I want to say a sincere thankyou to everyone who’s ever taken the time to read my words. I’ve had so much fun laughing with you on Fridays and occasionally gracing you with a legitimate opinion.

PN_LV14_IMPORTANT," Opinion | Save Pittsburgh, end gentrification By Paige Lawler, Assistant Opinions Editor Ask a group of Pitt students what their favorite neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are, and you’re sure to hear about Bloomfield and Lawrenceville. These neighborhoods are known for their charm and appeal, and they have plenty of coffee shops and small businesses that college students and adults enjoy. But these neighborhoods, along with others in the City, have been and still are being gentrified. Historically lowincome neighborhoods are seeing an economic and demographic shift as real estate investment and development increases, causing wealthier, usually more educated, residents to move in. Some may argue that gentrification is a positive thing, as it can improve the amenities and aesthetics of a neighborhood or city, but this is not the case in Pittsburgh. Gentrification in Pittsburgh forces longtime residents to leave their neighborhoods and communities, and it threatens to ruin the Promiti Debi | Senior Staff Illustrator City’s culture and diversity. When a neighborhood becomes subject to gentrification, the average income of the area usually increases, as do rent prices and the prevalence of luxury apartments. The combination of these elements can severely disrupt the original character of a neighborhood by introducing new housing or apartments that attract more affluent residents and by introducing new businesses that may force preexisting businesses, especially small businesses, to work harder to continue making a profit. Pittsburgh is one of the most intensely gentrified cities in the United States, with 20% of census tracts in the lower 40% of family incomes and home values undergoing gentrification between 2000 and 2013. Seattle and Portland, Oregon, also saw gentrification in 20% of their neighborhoods. Pittsburgh’s population is about 295,000 people, making it a significantly smaller city than both Seattle and Portland. The main issue with gentrification, at least in my mind, is not so much the presence of new coffee shops decorated in the midcentury modern style. The issue is that when a neighborhood is gentrified, and when businesses and luxury apartment buildings start to move in and drive real estate values through the roof, the rent for surrounding houses and apartments goes up. This makes neighborhoods less affordable, which in turn forces out longtime residents who no longer have the means to afford the new cost of living. For example, rising rent prices in Pittsburgh’s Polish Hill neighborhood made it difficult or impossible for some residents to continue living there. Rising housing costs are especially difficult for people who’ve lived in the neighborhood for a long time, and those who have fixed or low incomes. Oftentimes, this forces them to leave the neighborhood to find more affordable housing. This shows just how widespread of an issue gentrification is in Pittsburgh — it reaches beyond just East Liberty and Lawrenceville, two neighborhoods people commonly cite when discussing gentrification. Of course, there’s no way to stop neighborhoods from changing, and if it’s done correctly, updating a neighborhood can serve residents without gentrifying the area. Alexis Miller, former chair of the Polish Hill Civic Association and housing advocate for the neighborhood, told Pittsburgh City Paper in 2017 that Polish Hill has room for some private development, but developers should reach out to the PHCA before beginning any projects that would drastically alter the neighborhood. "", ""“It’s within developers’ best selfinterests to meet with community groups,” said Miller. “But if they choose not to, then that raises questions on their intentions to actually better the neighborhood.” Miller is absolutely correct in her assertion, especially because meeting with the community where a company plans to build a development is one of the best ways to curb gentrification. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, taking measures such as the ones Miller described is the best way to stop neighborhood revitalization from turning into gentrification. The difference between gentrification and revitalization is that gentrification only benefits a limited portion of the population — most often the wealthy, welleducated white people who move into gentrified areas. Revitalization is a way of improving neighborhoods that benefits all residents and works to guide the community toward a better neighborhood for all, regardless of race, income or education level. The Pittsburgh City Council should take note of this and apply the knowledge when approving multimilliondollar developments. Thus far, the Council has not proven that it is actively striving to end gentrification in the City, instead clearing the way in fall 2019 for a $50million development on the site of the former Penn Plaza Apartments in East Liberty. This development comes in spite of community backlash and controversy. Former residents of Penn Plaza protested the development, telling the Council that it was allowing gentrification and calling for an affordable housing development to be built instead. But the Council did not listen, instead committing to a courtstipulated solution, mandating that 70% of the tax revenue the new development generates will be split, with half going toward public infrastructure and the other half for affordable housing and improvements to nearby Enright Park. This is not a satisfactory solution, nor will it solve the issue of gentrification in East Liberty or anywhere else in Pittsburgh. The City Council needs to consult with the community where a private development is being proposed, and it must listen to what the community says will serve them best. It’s the best way to end gentrification in the City, and the only way to preserve the character and culture of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods.

PN_LV15," Contemporary Craft exhibit brings internationally recognized glass artists together By Anoushka Parnerkar, Staff Writer Michael Janis, an artist and the codirector of the Washington Glass School, said the artistic medium of glass is often more complex than others. “Glass is a seemingly untameable medium which continually finds itself in the lingering discourse of art versus craft,” Janis said. Contemporary Craft, an art gallery in Lawrenceville, is using glass to push traditional barriers of art and reveal the extraordinary. The gallery’s most recent exhibition, Transformation 11: Contemporary Works in Glass, features 17 international glass artists who are taking a modern Nate Yonamine | Senior Staff Photographer approach to the ageold craft. The exhibit runs through March Contemporary Craft, an art gallery in Lawrenceville that is hosting a new 18. exhibition, “Transformation 11: Contemporary Works in Glass.” Rachel Saul Rearick, Contemporary Craft’s executive director, said the organization aims to highlight exceptional art through the glass art exhibit. “Transformation recognizes an emerging or midcareer artist with a $5,000 prize and exhibition feature, along with a professionally produced video focusing on their artist practice,” Rearick said. Some glass art features idiosyncratic themes that go beyond just the medium itself. For contemporary glass artist David King, who is featured in the exhibition, his work focuses heavily on the concept of color. “Making color systems manifests in a lot of different ways. I have been making sheet glass, using a variety of colors similar to the process that was used to make stained glass panels,” King, an art professor at Ohio State University, said. King’s focus on color extends far beyond simply the colors of the rainbow. He said he takes a deeper and more scientific approach which incorporates how we see and perceive the world. “Sculpture or installation is based on this idea of site and perspective and like a projection of color, whether that’s real or virtual or implied.” King said. “Johann von Goethe wrote this book called The Theory of Colors, where he just studied color phenomena and recorded it. It was sort of an opposition to these systems and ideas that Newton had established.” King received an honorable mention for his work for the 2022 Elizabeth R. Raphael Founder’s Prize at Contemporary Craft. Another theme captured in this exhibition includes identity and the perception of self. Janis’ work focuses on portraiture through the lens of culture, time and family. Janis is directly inspired by his experiences as a multicultural child and the struggles he and his family faced when assimilating to life in Chicago, Illinois. He said he addresses a plethora of themes in his work. “At the core of my artwork is pure portraiture, but great focus on the disharmony of the self and perception,” Janis said. “I try to conjure scenes and feelings that evoke the slipperiness of memory, longing and an anxious curiosity.” "", ""According to the Contemporary Craft website, the very process that creates glass is breathtaking. When sand meets extreme heat, their powerful interaction produces a beautifully intricate and threedimensional medium. Each featured artist’s distinct creative processes show a deep appreciation for the natural medium. King said he finds that the creative process is more abstract than people may think. “The creative process is quite mysterious,” King said. “Sometimes there’s a moment of inspiration. You see something and it’s completely materialized. I’m inspired by the process, trying things, putting things together. Sometimes glass blowing is thought of as a dance because we’re often working with multiple people. It’s a bit of a creation.” Janis added that he views the collaborative aspect of glassmaking similarly to King. “I like engaging others with what I make, and incorporating both abstract and representational forms gives me the ability to tell stories and make the artwork something not just by me, but of me,” Janis said. “I have an almost obsessive focus that served me well when I was an architect, and now allows me to sit for hours maneuvering frit powder into intricate forms that populate my narratives.” But sometimes the kiln has an idea of its own, he said. “I’ve come to accept this result as a kind of organic quality that is part of the firing process. To cover my bases, I do a mojo dance to appease the kiln gods for a successful firing,” Janis said. "" )",Lawrenceville,event,2020-2025
PN_LV16," “Swooning” over art: Contemporary Craft to open to the public By Annabelle Walter, For The Pitt News Art is something that has the ability to bring people together. Artist Swoon’s exhibit at Contemporary Craft, “The Heart Lives Through the Hands,” does this quite literally, bringing living people in close contact with surreal human figures. The exhibition is the first at Contemporary Craft, a selfnamed “space for creativity,” since it closed its Strip District building for relocation last October. The gallery will open at 22% capacity on Thursday in its new Upper Lawrenceville building, and while the exhibit is free, visitors must reserve a timed Courtesy of Contemporary Craft ticket on the space’s website. Artist Swoon’s exhibit at Contemporary Craft, “The Heart Lives Through the The first thing visitors see when entering the exhibit is an Hands.” asymmetrical collection of church tiles, pieces that Swoon worked on while revitalizing an old church in Braddock, a nearby Pittsburgh suburb. Swoon has passed on this project to someone else this year, hoping to “make her sole living as an artist,” according to her assistant, Kate Lydon. But these tiles weren’t just the work of Swoon. Lydon said while revitalizing the church, the artist enlisted the help of local children, teaching them how to create intricate designs on the tiles. This taught children a valuable skill while giving them a hand in revitalizing a building in their own community, Lydon said. Stephanie Sun, the director of operations and finance for Contemporary Craft, said the church project in Braddock was one of the events that first introduced Swoon to Contemporary Craft. Although this is her first solo show in Pittsburgh, she has worked with the gallery before. “I have many interactions with Swoon and have worked with her before. One of her works was in our social justice exhibition — “Mindful: Exploring Mental Health Through Art” in 2015 [and 2016] and has hosted a print sale in our space to fundraise for her Braddock church building revitalization project,” Sun said. Another piece, “Dawn and Gemma,” depicts a mother and child. The piece is mounted onto a manysided “found” object and created using a technique that involves layering paper and paint to achieve the desired result. Visitors can view the pieces at a close range, which Contemporary Craft welcomes. Sun pointed out that the exhibition has no lines on the floor restricting access and/or movement, so visitors can get as close to the art as they want to. Sun also said the choice to feature Swoon in the gallery’s new building opening hinged on the relationship between the artist and Contemporary Craft and their closely aligned beliefs and interests. She said she felt both parties are heavily invested in the greater Pittsburgh area, and aim to share art with which all people can identify. “Her work is also incredible technically and visually diverse and tells human stories,” Sun said. “The sense of connection to people and the community through her art is one of the key reasons why we choose Swoon as our inaugural exhibition to open the Lawrenceville building.” Contemporary Craft originally planned to open the new building in April, but had to delay the process due to COVID19 safety concerns, Sun said. She noted that opening now is not ideal due to the pandemic, the organization felt it couldn’t afford to remain closed for much longer. "", ""“A huge part of the reason to open during the COVID19 is for the sustainability of the organization. We have been closed since October 2019 due to the relocation,” Sun said. “Without a proper space to welcome the public, we couldn’t generate earned revenue.” Sun said the new building is wellsuited to Contemporary Craft’s needs — it was large enough to host classes, exhibitions and Contemporary Craft’s store. The building was also within the organization’s budget and required very little restoration. “[The building] sparked ideas right from the beginning of how we can do very little in renovation to transform it into a space the organization needs,” Sun said. Sun said the organization worked with a group of museums and galleries to determine the best safety measures for reopening. “We were able to learn from the group and carefully plan our opening and safety protocol that is suitable for an organization of our size,” Sun said. Sun also said seeing other galleries reopen and hearing enthusiastic responses from previous Contemporary Craft visitors convinced the organization to open its doors and safely welcome the Pittsburgh community into the new building. “The successful reopening of peer organizations and the enthusiastic response from our visitors upon hearing the news of our opening, is really what encouraged us to move forward with opening,” Sun said.

PN_LV17," ‘More motivated than ever’: Pittsburgh tattoo shops persevere through pandemic By Lucas DiBlasi, Staff Writer Despite the COVID19 pandemic still raging in the United States, many tattoo shops in Allegheny County are open for business. The shops that survived months of closure reopened to a world where staying 6 feet apart is a necessity for life, while closing that distance to a client is a necessity for their livelihood. Pittsburgh tattoo artists are navigating the world of socially distanced tattooing and attempting to ensure safety for their clients while coping with the pandemic themselves. Despite a faltering economy, many artists said they’ve seen a surprising spike in business, a welcome problem that has nevertheless created difficulties in safely keeping up with demand. Kaycee Orwig | Assistant Visual Editor Pittsburgh tattoo artists are navigating the world of socially distanced Paul DeMarco, manager and artist at Empire Tattoo on tattooing and attempting to ensure safety for their clients while coping with Meyran Avenue, remembers seeing COVID19 in the news the pandemic themselves. only a few days before having to close. “It was really sudden,” DeMarco said. “We didn’t know what to do. We just shut the door, put up a sign, made a few Facebook posts and stayed home for two and a half months.” Other individual artists forged their own paths, even through the sudden change. Susie Humphrey tattooed at Pittsburgh Tattoo Company Downtown for five years before leaving in late February. Humphrey followed through on plans to create Sanctuary, her own private tattoo studio in Lawrenceville, just before the statewide shutdown in midMarch. “I signed my lease for Sanctuary on March 1, which was terrible timing,” Humphrey said. “I’m not only tattooing through a quarantine, I decided to open a business in the middle of a quarantine.” Humphrey brought her clientele with her to her new studio and leaned on their support when she went through her entire savings in January and February. “I had clientele prebook appointments and pay deposits,” Humphrey said. “I designed Tshirts and did a presale and sold enough Tshirts to cover my rent for May.” Humphrey was not the only tattoo artist who made entrepreneurial advances during the shutdown. Drew Armstrong, a 2019 Pitt alumnus, said he had to reschedule a longawaited appointment with his artist for a similar reason. “My artist made a new post that said that the shop she was working at decided to close, so she’s opening up her own private studio,” Armstrong said. Other artists survived the twoandahalfmonth shop closures through various other means. Michael Cipollone, who has tattooed as an independent contractor for In The Blood Tattoo studio in South Side for eight years, said he was able to get by on his savings. “I used my off time to paint and create a lot of new tattoo designs and artwork. I also focused on more cooking, reading and bike riding,” Cipollone said. “It was nice to be able to do a hard reset and come back to work energized and more motivated than ever to tattoo.” "", ""Aaron Harding, who tattoos for Pittsburgh Tattoo Company, said he also used the time off to work on artistic pursuits. “I wasn’t able to tattoo for over two months, so I tried to keep myself busy by painting signs and skateboards for friends,” Harding said. “It was a muchneeded break to be honest.” When Allegheny County moved to the green phase of reopening on June 5, tattoo shops opened to what several artists saw as a surprising spike in business. Humphrey has a monthslong waitlist, and Harding said that business has been “crazy.” “It has been absolutely insanely busy since the reopening,” Harding said. The exact reason for the spike in business isn’t clear, and several artists speculated as to why there has been an influx of clients. Cipollone pointed out that many people have more free time, and may have also received money from the government that they want to put toward getting a tattoo. DeMarco speculated that there was pentup demand. “We have had a wild response to reopening,” DeMarco said. “A lot of people want to support small businesses. A lot of our regular clients are like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna come in and get something.’ It’s been a little overwhelming.” The influx of business while the pandemic is ongoing poses challenges to the safety of artists and their customers. But Armstrong said he didn’t feel that he was taking too much of a risk by getting a tattoo. “They had these guidelines that only one person would be able to get tattooed at a time and you wouldn’t be able to bring any friends,” Armstrong said. Harding said he was worried about the safety of returning to work, but that worry has waned since coming back. “We’ve always maintained a sterile work environment, so not much has changed outside of wearing a mask,” Harding said. Beyond the safety precautions that shops are taking, artists have recommendations for best practices for safely scheduling an appointment. DeMarco recommended wearing a mask and staying home if you’d traveled recently, as did Humphrey, along with a few other recommendations. “I would definitely say that making an appointment ahead of time is the safest, best way to get any tattoo at any studio, just because you’re not walking in on, potentially, multiple people in the lobby and [artists are] prepared for you,” Humphrey said. But even though there has been an influx of business since reopening, many artists expressed concern for their future. “If there’s anything that 2020 has shown us, it’s that you can never really plan for anything,” Humphrey said. “You have to adapt and change as your environment changes.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV18," How to not kill your dorm plants By Charlie Taylor, Culture Editor Plants were meant to be in the great outdoors, not some stuffy dorm room — but if you’re looking for a companion, a new hobby or even just a little greenery for your room, a lowmaintenance house plant can be a great option. Drew Clouse has worked at City Grows — an organic garden shop in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood that caters to people living in small spaces — for five years and is currently the shop’s social media manager. A 2013 Pitt grad, they know firstyear dorms like Litchfield Towers don’t always provide ideal living conditions for house plants. Still, they said the right plant with the right care can not only thrive in a dorm room, but help its owner thrive as well. “You can have something to take care of and something outside of schoolwork that you can be like, ‘Here’s this thing I need to make sure I’m on top of,’” Clouse said. Choose the right plant Not every plant is wellsuited for college life. Clouse recommends snake plants, ZZ plants and pothos because they require minimal sunlight and watering. They said owners should only water them every week and a half to every few weeks, which means these plants will last long enough without water for you to go home on breaks and not worry Charlie Taylor | Contributing Editor about them. A house plant sits on a college student’s desk. “If you water them right before [winter] break and then get them when you come back, they should be pretty okay,” Clouse said. “Pothos need a little more water, but they can definitely bounce back.” If you have some experience and are open to more of a commitment, Clouse suggests ferns, air plants and calatheas, but cautioned that those plants sometimes pose a challenge for beginners. “They need a bit more upkeep, so depending on the person, I don’t know if I’d immediately recommend them,” Clouse said. No sun? No problem According to Clouse, each of the plants they recommended can thrive in indirect sunlight, which is essential for plants kept in a room with one small window. Since they don’t need sunny conditions, they can easily stay on a shelf or nightstand — as long as they still get some light. “Pretty much all of them you can stick wherever in a dorm,” Clouse said. “Obviously, the closer to the window in general the better, but they don’t need to be directly on the windowsill.” Although succulents may look cute and don’t require frequent watering to stay alive, Clouse warned against purchasing one for a dorm. Because desert plants need direct sunlight, rooms with one small window tend to be too dim to support them. “You can theoretically get away with that in a dorm, but it really depends on the dorm room and how much light you get in through the window,” Clouse said. “You need a really bright window.” "", ""Recognize its needs Nobody’s a perfect plant parent — sometimes we overwater or underwater and end up with plants that look a little worse for wear. Clouse said owners can generally tell what they’re doing wrong by how the leaves look. Yellowing leaves usually indicate the plant is getting too much water, while browning, crispy leaves indicate it’s getting too little. Clouse also said every plant is different, and to really know what it needs requires research. When your snake plant or fern seems a little off, they said Google is often the way to go. “A lot of [learning upkeep] is doing research online, because some plants show different symptoms depending on what’s wrong,” Clouse said.

PN_LV19," Editorial: 93 bus line needed on weekends for Pitt populace By The Pitt News Editorial Board Port Authority buses are going to be hitting the streets a little harder on the weekends, starting midMarch. Port Authority announced last Tuesday that a few more bus lines will operate on the weekend, starting March 15. The 60WalnutCrawford Village, the 53Homestead Park, the P68Braddock Hills Flyer, the 2Mount Royal and the 67Monroeville will all now be in full operation on Saturday and Sunday. The 67 bus is the only bus with service changes that runs through Oakland. The bus travels outbound via Forbes Avenue and inbound via Fifth Avenue. There are other buses TPN File Photo that run through Oakland, though, that don’t provide weekend Port Authority announced last Tuesday that a few more bus lines will service. One of these buses is the 93, which takes students operate on the weekend, starting March 15. from the far side of the Boulevard to campus, and runs into Bloomfield, Lawrenceville and Squirrel Hill. Currently, there doesn’t seem to be a plan to add weekend bus service to the 93 bus schedule, but there should be. The 93 runs inbound Oakland, Hazelwood, Glen Hazel via Greenfield and outbound Oakland through Lawrenceville. There are 82 stops along the busline, which most importantly transports students who live Juliet Street, Ward Street and Dawson Street — typically over a mile away from Pitt — to campus. It’s not only convenient to have a steady service alongside the 30A campus shuttle — which also runs to the other side of the Boulevard of the Allies — but it’s also necessary. The Pitt shuttle is only available to Pitt students, and unlike the 10A, which goes to upper campus, the 30A does not run on the weekends either. For students, this is even more reason for the 93 to run seven days a week. Plenty of people need access to Pitt’s campus on more than just the weekdays, though. And aside from the 93 directly, there aren’t other bus lines that are directly transferable. So people living on the far side of Boulevard are left only with the option to walk, or not come to Pitt at all. The 93 also provides an efficient and safe way for people to get home after dark, especially from a weekend campus event. But the bus line is important for more than just the trip between South Oakland and campus. The 93 is also the only bus that runs directly from Oakland to Children’s Hospital in Lawrenceville. Both Pitt faculty and students do a lot of work in this particular hospital, and it isn’t always on the weekdays. Medical students work in rotations there, and professors instruct clinical sessions. Senior nursing students work clinical shifts on the weekend as well as weekdays sometimes, and other STEM students and professors conduct research within the hospital labs. Programs in other departments — like education — also partner with Children’s. Anyone in Oakland — student/faculty or not — should have a direct route to primary hospitals in the City every day of the week. So it’s time to add weekend service to the 93. Though bus services halt on the weekend, the journeys to campus, the partnerships, research and hospital rotations don’t. ",Lawrenceville,transit,2020-2025
PN_LV20," Opinion | I Watched 122 Movies in 2019 By Aidan Segal, For The Pitt News If Pulitzer Prizewinning film critic Roger Ebert said, “Film can take us where we cannot go,” then I have been all over the world in the past year. I was a lovesick nightclub owner in “Casablanca” and a hardnosed detective in “Chinatown.” I was a “Rebel Without a Cause” in Los Angeles and a deranged “Taxi Driver” in New York City. “Once Upon a Time in America,” I was a merciless Jewish gangster, and “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” I Image via Wikimedia Commons was a fading TV cowboy. And I have gone to the moon a few times, too. It was a New Year’s resolution of mine to watch as many movies as time would allow me and it turned out I had more than I thought — enough to watch 122 movies. It probably sounds ridiculous, and you would be in good company with my parents for thinking in such a way — though I suspect a lot of the animosity stems from my relentless Al Pacino impression whose excellence they refuse to acknowledge — but I wanted to undergo a yearlong journey of purpose and meaning that I couldn’t find in losing weight, becoming more environmentally conscious or reading the Bible in its entirety — I’m a bad Jew, I didn’t even make it through Genesis. For me, this journey of sorts was not a way to challenge myself, but a means of setting aside time to focus on something I am passionate about, and that is not something that should be exclusive to cinema. You know you have signed up for a life of pretentiousness when you become a cinephile — the word itself sounds exclusive and pompous. It describes a person who is passionate about film, and it’s the kind of word the socalled profound intellectual Holden Caulfield would call himself in “The Catcher in the Rye.” But that is a book, and quite famously, nevertobeamovie per J.D. Salinger’s refusal to sell the movie rights and apparent dying wish, so I am not sure why I brought that up. Maybe it is because I am a cinephile, and I like to say things that sound smart. How do you watch 122 movies in a single year? It’s easy and only takes two steps. First, you must watch an average of about three movies a week and then you must become a really good liar. You tell your friends you are sick and cannot hangout tonight, because really you will be in bed with a bowl of popcorn watching Martin Sheen’s face rise from the swamp in the Vietnam War epic, “Apocalypse Now.” You tell your parents that you are looking for a job, but really you are at Rowhouse Theater in Lawrenceville watching Alfred Hitchcock’s “North by Northwest.” You email your professor apologizing for waking up late and missing class because you were writing an essay all night for another class, but really you couldn’t remove yourself from the comedic genius of “Borat.” Hollywood is becoming increasingly dull and unoriginal. The past decade is littered with “nostalgia porn” — pointless sequels and liveaction remakes of animated films for a sentimental audience made by studios with every intention of making a quick buck and not creating something new. And as much as I appreciate the streaming service era for offering film buffs like myself access to a collection of critically acclaimed movies all on one platform, Netflix and company are destroying the moviegoing experience. Movies belong on the big screen, and because we are at a cultural crossroads, it might not be long before theaters fade into obscurity and are treated the way record players "", ""are today — a nostalgic trend. I am a snob. When legendary director Martin Scorsese of “Goodfellas” and “Raging Bull” fame denounced Marvel movies as “not cinema” and other franchise pieces of garbage in an interview with Empire last November, I rejoiced. “Honestly, the closest I can think of them [Marvel movies], as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks,” Scorsese said. “It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.” How many times can you go to the theater to watch the downandout guy who acquires superhuman powers only to be faced with more “unexpected” obstacles before beating the bad guy in the end? My comic book brethren, quit kidding yourselves. It’s the same story, just a different costume. I, on the other hand, love the classics. I love the blackandwhite film noirs from the ’40s and ’50s like “The Big Sleep” and “Sunset Boulevard” with the heavy cigarette smoke and cocktail drinking, the forbidden romance and the unsolvable murder. I love when filmmakers push boundaries and challenge the audience in films like “Midnight Cowboy” and “A Clockwork Orange.” And I love “The Godfather” — its legacy speaks for itself. Selecting which films to watch was just as entertaining as watching them. Usually it was as simple as looking up lists of what are regarded as the best films ever made, but after I exhausted my way through the majority of the suggestions from the International Movie Database and American Film Institute, I resorted to other methods. After having watched almost all of Stanley Kubrick’s works, I became curious as to what movies he watched, which movies inspired him. And I didn’t stop with Kubrick. I researched all my favorite filmmakers’ favorite films. Woody Allen listed Federico Fellini’s Italian surrealist masterpiece, “8 ½,” and Orson Welles’ “Citizen Kane” which is always in the ‘best movie ever’ debate. Quentin Tarantino listed Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western epic, “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and Howard Hawks classic screwball comedy, “His Girl Friday.” I would watch any movie that got the stamp of approval from movie critics and it could have been anything from silent films to biblical epic. And every time I watched a movie I logged it in a Google doc along with my personal rating — it’s a bit obsessive, but I couldn’t have done it any other way. My favorite moments of the year were in some way or another a result of movies. My friends and I bonded over a love for the aesthetic violence and rapidfire dialogue of Tarantino flicks like “Inglourious Basterds,” and “Kill Bill.” We impersonated our favorite — and least favorite — actors like Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson. We argued over whether or not Star Wars is overrated. It is. Movies do, in fact, take us places we cannot go, and teach us not just about the world, but about the people we watch them with. Movies spark arguments about our place in the world and they hone in on our rawest of emotions. Cinema is the most effective artform that can do such a thing and if you don’t feel that way, it is because you aren’t watching the right movies. When I transferred to the University of Pittsburgh this past year, the closest friends I have made can attest to my obsession for movies in that one of the first things they remember me saying is “Wait, you have never seen ‘Pulp Fiction’?” And now they have. Because of me. Aidan is a junior majoring in English Writing with a certificate in Jewish Studies. Write to Aidan @als473@pitt.edu "" )",Lawrenceville,event,2020-2025
PN_LV21," Plain White T’s perform at the Thunderbird in Lawrenceville By Patrick Swain, Culture Editor As fans filed into the Thunderbird Café and Music Hall on bustling Butler Street in Lawrenceville, Tom Higgenson recounted writing “Hey There Delilah.” He said once the song rocketed his band the Plain White T’s to stardom in 2006, they played it every chance they could. “Ever since that song really blew up, you kinda got to play it every night. But, you know, we love playing it, because it’s a moment that people really get into and everyone sings along, and it’s a really special moment every night,” Higgenson said. “Some bands hate playing their hits, but we love playing that one.” Nate Yonamine | Assistant Visual Editor The Plain White T’s packed the venue for a soldout show on Lead singer Tom Higgenson of Plain White T’s performs at the Thunderbird Friday night.

Holding a signed vinyl record of their latest selftitled LP before the show, Riley said seeing the band in person was a dream come true. “I was just talking to my brother and telling him how I wanted to see them, and I was looking on Ticketmaster because I always Nate Yonamine | Assistant Visual Editor just check the list, and they popped up, and I was like, ‘You’re kidding me,’” Riley said after meeting the band. “Amazing. Absolutely amazing.” "", ""Minutes before taking the stage, Higgenson instructed the audience to pull out their phones and visit a website to vote on a special song for the night’s set list. The Plain White T’s began the show with “Our Time Now,” a song from their hit 2007 album “Every Second Counts.” They played about 20 songs, a blend of their older tracks and cuts from their new selftitled album from November. Longtime listeners in the audience sang every word to soft ballads like “1, 2, 3, 4.” Guitarist Tim Lopez took over vocals for “The Giving Tree,” while bassist Mike Retondo held down the low end and drummer De’Mar Hamilton sat behind the kit dressed in white from head to toe. Singer Jill Beckett joined the band on stage for “Would You Even,” a heavier single from last year. Beckett’s band Pollyanna is touring with the Plain White T’s, opening for them across the country. Pollyanna, led by Beckett on vocals and guitar, played a halfhourlong set evoking the electricity of energetic rock acts like Paramore. Beckett said the opportunity to accompany the Plain White T’s on their tour has changed their lives. Nate Yonamine | Assistant Visual Editor “We’ve been on tour with them for the best two weeks, three weeks,” Beckett said. “It’s been awesome. It’s definitely been a lifechanging tour. It’s been really, really cool. Honestly, definitely a gamechanging tour for us.” The Plain White T’s led the crowd along until an encore, after the earlier audience poll yielded their 2007 song “Friends Don’t Let Friends Dial Drunk.” Following its final notes, Higgenson donned an acoustic guitar and spoke into the microphone. “I think this is the longest set we’ve ever done on a tour,” Higgenson said as the Thunderbird fell silent and he finally strummed the opening chords of “Hey There Delilah.” The tune turned into a tender singalong with the audience across three levels of the venue, reaching the furthest corners of the room. After Higgenson swapped out the last “Delilah” for “Pittsburgh” and led the crowd through a final, cathartic chorus, the Thunderbird felt a little smaller. "" )",Lawrenceville,event,2020-2025

They [Mendelssohn’s retailers] just want to do their business.” The building is an example of midcentury modern architecture in Pittsburgh, which Mendelssohn said is what originally drew him to the property. “We have very little midcentury architecture, especially really good midcentury architecture in the City here. So getting my hands on one of them was really spectacular and it was great restoring it,” Mendelssohn said. “They built it to be the center of the neighborhood, to make it feel like people could come in and out, with the big glass, and the way it was kind of structured was meant to be a hub. And you don’t want to fight that.” At the Market House’s grand opening Thursday, seven out of nine of the retail spaces were filled with small businesses. This was accomplished all without the largescale marketing the Mendelssohns planned for – Brian Mendelssohn said they never got around to it. “We put the neon up that just said ‘Market House’ and we were so busy through the pandemic and getting this project together and running all of our other projects that we have ongoing, and we just never got around to all the marketing that we intended to do,” Mendelssohn said. But he also said the lack of marketing was only beneficial in creating intrigue around the space. “I think that actually created intrigue, it just says ‘Market House’ and it looks cool, and I think that was enough for people to inquire, saying, ‘Well, what is this?’ and then we explain it to them, and they’re like, ‘Alright, sign me up,’” Mendelssohn said. Erin Smrekar of Storehouse Neutral, a home decor store, said the opportunity to have a physical location has always been a dream for her, so she tries to embody the spirit of the Market House when curating her products. "", ""“This has always been my dream, to have my own thing on a really small level, and to be able to know the people that are shopping,” Smrekar said. “Everything is kind of sourced from all over, but I try and really keep things small. That way you’re supporting another small business in another city, while you’re supporting your own city too.” Smrekar was born and raised in Pittsburgh, and said she never left. She said she’s been watching Lawrenceville grow the whole time. “I’ve been in Pittsburgh my whole life, and I just feel like I’ve watched Lawrenceville grow,” Smrekar said. “You could tell there was something happening in Lawrenceville and I kind of always wanted to be here, just knowing the foot traffic drives itself.” Emi Driscoll, Black Cherry Design’s design studio and retail manager, said Black Cherry Design had a retail space in the past, but the market house was such a special opportunity they couldn’t pass it up. “There’s so much art, there’s so much going on and I love living down here, walking to work,” Driscoll said. “We found out about this opportunity and thought it would be awesome to have a little retail space.” Driscoll said her personal goals for Black Cherry Design’s physical location in Lawrenceville was to highlight Pittsburgh artists and makers in a casual way. “We really emphasize local makers and local artists, and that’s kind of the point of the store. We want to put out a community and make these connections in the community,” Driscoll said. “Emphasizing local Pittsburgh artists, ‘cause I’m an artist myself, and I just think it’s really important to give these people a space to share their work in a casual way.” For Mendelssohn, he said it all comes back to improving and growing with the neighborhood. “Understanding the community’s needs and what we can do to make it better has really become a passion over the last 20 years,” Mendelssohn said.

PN_LV23," Get Out of Oakland | Lawrenceville By Nadiya Greaser, Staff Writer If you’re sick of chain retail, Chipotle and cheap drinks, get out of Oakland and visit some other Pittsburgh neighborhoods. It’s time to act like a real Pittsburgher and not some slowwalking suburban transplant and have an adventure. Take a 20minute ride on the 93 bus to Lawrenceville, the neighborhood equivalent of a flannel shirt and a turmeric superjuice. Sarcasm aside, Lawrenceville is a fun, walkable neighborhood with an abundance of cocktail bars, locally owned and often locally sourced restaurants, coffee shops and kitschythemed hangouts. It’s the ideal place to spend a whole Saturday. You can start the morning with a boozy Image via Wikimedia Commons brunch, do a little vintage and thrift shopping, grab lunch or Butler Street in Upper Lawrenceville on Jan. 13, 2012. coffee, spend the afternoon pinballing or candlemaking and end the day at a cocktail bar or hot dog shop. Things To Do: Mix Candle Co. Mix Candle Co., formerly the Candle Lab, blends DIY craftiness with sweetsmelling essential oils in handpoured soy candles. Mix’s instagrammable store has more than 120 distinct scents, which you can mix and match until you create a custom scent. Customers pay for the jars, not the custom oils, so you can pour a smaller single wick candle or a three wick candle that will burn for more than 100 hours. When you go into the store, you can browse a fancysmelling wall until you find the scents you like best, and then you choose three to mix into your custom candle. Mixing the candles takes around 30 minutes, and they set for 90 minutes — which is an ideal amount of time to wander Lawrenceville, bowl a game at Arsenal or grab dinner. There is a step up into the storefront, and the counters and barstools are not wheelchair height. Kickback Pinball Cafe Kickback Pinball Cafe is, perfectly and unsurprisingly, a cafe full of pinball machines. The cafe is an ideal blend of arcade nostalgia, milkshakes and melts. The drink menu includes classic caffeinated options like cold brew, cappuccino and espresso, plus shaken iced teas, shakes, root beer floats and affogato. The food menu has bagels, avocado toast and loaded melts. There is a step up into the storefront. Redfishbowl Studios Redfishbowl Studios is a grassroots artist collective that curates events and showcases local artists. They also host studio tours, exhibitions and opentothepublic events. If you’re looking for a creative night out, attend the studio’s Drink and Draw Thursdays. A weekly event hosted by rotating artists, Drink and Draw is an opportunity to paint, draw and be creative. If you’re looking for a more structured evening of drawing practice, attend their Wednesday Figure Drawing Class, with live nude models and instructions and tips from the artist host. The Thursday night events are free and open to the public, and the Wednesday class is a $10, preregistered event. The studio is holding a ticketed Halloween masquerade party on Oct. 29 to celebrate their threeyear anniversary, with live music. If you want to look cultured on a first date, call Redfishbowl and book a private studio tour. Bonus points if you wear a fancy scarf or vaguely French hat. The studio is on the second floor and is not wheelchair accessible. "", ""Row House Cinema With its penchant for pickle popcorn and old movies, Row House Cinema is definitely in the top five independent theaters in Pittsburgh, which would be true even if there were more than five independent theaters in Pittsburgh. This month, the theater is running its Row House of Horrors lineup, which includes classics like “Halloween,” “The Shining,” Dario Argento’s “Deep Red” and surprise spooky picks like “The Witches” and “Hocus Pocus.” If you’re over 21, you can grab a craft beer, cider or hard seltzer from the attached Bierport, a bottleshop and taproom. Next month, you’ll be able to cross the street and grab a donut from Oliver’s Donuts, which is coowned by one of the founders of Row House. Attendees must provide either proof of vaccination or of a negative COVID19 test within 72 hours, so make sure to take your vax card and ID. The theater is wheelchair accessible and offers closed captioning devices for certain screenings. Places to Eat and Drink: Belvedere’s Ultradive Belvedere’s is both a place to drink and to do things because really our favorite places are the ones where we can drink and do things. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are cool and the themed nights are perfect if your biggest problem with Pittsburgh clubs is the lack of ABBA or emo music. Tuesday nights are karaoke, Wednesday nights are standup comedy and the rest of the week is full of throwback dance parties, the aptly named “Sadderday” emo nights and themed disco events. Like Row House, Belvedere’s requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID19 test, so you can sing and dance and sweat with a relative sense of safety. There is a step up into the bar, and the bar and tables are hightops. Bar Botanico Bar Botanico’s craft cocktails and small plates are ideal for a first date or a happy hour with friends. The Scratch & Co Kitchen inside Bar Botanico has possibly the best appetizer game in Pittsburgh — the pierogi of the week is always good, or try the veggie sliders or butternut coconut curry. While the bar has a good selection of wine and beer, the cocktails are unique and wellcrafted and are really the best part of the drinks menu. Bar Botanico’s bartender feature this month is the Beetle Juice, a brightly colored mix of green chartreuse, midori, lemon and absinthe. The Cool Hand Cuke, Gillyweed Gimlet and espresso martini are exceptionally good and highlight the skill of the bartenders. If nothing on the drinks menu feels exactly right, the bartenders will mix a custom drink for you based on the flavors you like. Bar Botanico is wheelchair accessible and has both bar and table seating. Franktuary Franktuary is a locally owned, locally sourced restaurant that serves grownup hot dogs, beer and boozy floats in a store that feels more like your favorite food truck — not surprising, considering that’s how it started. The allhot dog menu might feel gimmicky, but the loaded hot dogs, pierogies and poutine are so good that you forget the humble hot dog underneath the piles of coleslaw, pineapple or chili. Two favorites are the Oahu, an allbeef frank topped with grilled pineapple, bacon and teriyaki and the Chicago Imposter, a skinless frank with a pickle wedge, tomatoes, onions, banana peppers, relish, mustard, celery salt and poppy seed. Franktuary is wheelchair accessible and has both table and booth seating. Geppetto With savory and sweet crepes and waffles, La Prima espresso and Turkish coffee, Geppetto cafe is easily one of the best brunches in the City — the abundance of sweet and savory crepes, waffles, french toast and paninis is perfect for a big brunch with friends. The tiramisu and banoffee sweet crepes are especially rich and indulgent, and the ham and gruyere panini with honey aioli is a fancy, filling, grownup grilled cheese. The cafe also has an extensive tea and milkshake menu. The cafe is wheelchair accessible and has freestanding tables. "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV24," The best cafés to caffeinate and cram for finals By Irene Castillo, Senior Staff Writer The worst part about finals is to see your life dwindle away in the small space of your room, finishing up essay after essay. After a while, the monotony doesn’t help you get work done. That is where the beauty of coffee shops comes in — a little treat and an adventure bundled up in one. As a coffee nerd, I’ve spent the past three years scouring the city for the best coffee shops that offer a good study space for me to bang on my keyboard and get a delicious drink in the process. Here are my top coffee shops, from closest to campus to furthest away. Redhawk Coffee | Meyran Avenue, Oakland Amaya Lobato | Senior Staff Photographer People sit inside of Redhawk Coffee on Meyran Avenue. I usually write my articles for The Pitt News at Redhawk. While the space is tiny, and I need to stare people down to get a table, both their coffee and ambiance are amazing for coworking, meetings and anything that involves writing. I love their iced latte with extra cinnamon for when it’s warm, but if I can sit down and relax, their cortado is amazing — thick crema and milk foam, savory and aromatic, and the perfect ratio of espresso to milk. Their grind changes daily — you can see their bean of the day displayed on a small blackboard by the cashier! — but Cauca, from Colombia, is my current goto. It’s more floral and fruity, like tart cherry, so it works great iced and hot. Their tea selection is great, but their matcha is too light and milky for my taste. They also carry Pigeon Bagels, my favorite pastry shop in town. Their coffee cake is perfectly crumbly and not too sweet for a midday snack. P.S. If you ever find yourself too tired to fight for a table but still want their great coffee, go to Scaife Hall at CMU! It’s only a five minute walk from Frick Fine Arts, and they have plenty of chairs and tables for you! The Café at Carnegie | Forbes Avenue, Oakland The first coffee shop I ever tried as a first year was at the Carnegie Museum, and I still believe it’s one of the best on campus. Lillian — the blonde barista you can find chirping away with the customers — pours an amazing cortado. Their bean is Commonplace Coffee, and while it’s not my favorite grind, the bittersweet chocolate taste is a great find if you are short on time. While the Café doesn’t have electrical outlets — an absolute pain — their booths are private and comfy enough for you to get some readings and worksheets done. It’s also an amazing place for networking if you’re in the humanities! I always meet new people from my department there. Tazza D’Oro | Lytton Avenue, Oakland Tazza D’Oro is found closer to Clapp, Cathy and the Computer Science Building. I prefer them when I’m craving a hot cup of tea, since they have a long menu of tea varieties. They also have a great deli fridge, where they carry salads and sweets, vegan options included. It’s usually not packed, as its entrance is discreet, and the only people you will find are parents staying at the Oaklander or Wyndham. Their tables are small, for two people max, so it’s a great spot for some alone study time. They also carry The Pitt News! (#selfpromo) Redstart Roasters | Euclid Avenue, East Liberty Only 15ish minutes away from campus by bus, and sharing a line with Target, Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s, Redstart Roasters is an amazing place for coffee nerds like me. Their menu features nine different types of singleorigin coffee beans and a specific roast for their espresso and cold brew. I’ve never been a fan of pourovers — I found them too watery — but this place convinced me to offer "", ""them a second chance. Their location is lowprofile enough that you won’t catch your friends here, so you’ll get work done. They also have a great big, shared table with outlets and lamps, so you can sit down for those five hours to finish your essay for English composition. Mosaic Leaf Matcha Bar | Butler Street, Lawrenceville I’ve always been a tea person, way before I started drinking coffee. Matcha is great for a quick, sweeter caffeine fix, especially if you’re trying to avoid caffeine on days when you are stressed out. Mosaic Leaf Matcha Bar doesn’t just offer their own tea brand but also has matcha ice cream, kombucha, seasonal drinks and specialized drinks — such as their spritz and “focus drinks.” They have an iced lavender matcha — matcha with lavender buds, not the syrup — that got me through my very hectic museums and society study session. Their venue is matcha green, filled with flowers and plants with a few tables. It’s never too full, so you can always snag a table and enjoy your study treat and your sweet reward! Butterwood Bake Consortium | Butler Street, Lawrenceville The farthest from campus, Butterwood was recommended to me by a Pitt alumnus after hearing me cry about being unable to find a “not too sweet” cake for my birthday. Butterwood is 30 minutes away from campus by bus, but their store is simply too cute to not go. Their coffee — by KLVN Coffee — falls on the more chocolaty side, but it blends perfectly with their menu of floral and spiced cakes with buttercream. They offer a different cake menu every day, with flavors ranging from cardamom, strawberry and poppy seed cakes to ube and lavender tea cakes. Their buttercream is salty, and their cakes crumble perfectly, so pairing them with a simple unsweetened latte is a perfect idea. Their vintagedecorated, warmly lit store also offers plenty of seats with electrical outlets for you to get your work done. "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV25," Students discuss on, offcampus bar options By Briana Bindus, Staff Writer Although there are a variety of bars open to Pitt students close to campus, Avery Moore thinks they “all feel very undergraduate.” “There’s a lot more to explore in the Pittsburgh area when you’re 21,” Moore, a senior finance major, said. “When you become 21, there kind of does become more to do, and it really opens up your world a bit, which is nice.” Amanda Carson, a 2023 Pitt graduate, said she felt a “very different vibe” when she began going to offcampus bars rather than ones close by. Alex Jurkuta | Staff Photographer “You get a lot more of all ages of people — it’s a little bit more 5801 Video Lounge & Café on Ellsworth Ave in the Shadyside neighborhood chill and relaxed,” Carson said. of Pittsburgh. According to Carson, this wider age range at bars contributes to a more comfortable vibe at the bar. Instead of being around young college students who are “super chaotic and sloppy,” she said she appreciates that there are more mature people with a variety of reasons for going out. “You will definitely see more people there for multiple different reasons at offcampus bars, as opposed to when you’re on campus bars, it’s definitely with the intention to get drunk,” Carson said. “Offcampus bars are very much, you’re going to this place for this reason. You’re gonna go to 5801 because you want to dance, you’re gonna go to Cavo because it’s your birthday and you want a club vibe. You’re deciding the demographic you want to partake in.” Offcampus bars offer a number of experiences that students can choose from based on the day and occasion. Moore finds it more enjoyable to get a “cute cocktail” over dinner around the Pittsburgh area. “More so than [my roommates and I] would go to a bar, we’ll go to a nice dinner, which I honestly like,” Moore said. “Meat and Potatoes, Coop de Ville — they are all really nice restaurants … you can get food there, you can get drinks, there’s games, it’s just fun like that.” One aspect of offcampus bars that is harder to find around Oakland are event nights, which Moore loves. Urban Tap, a restaurant with a location on the South Side, has Thursday trivia nights with halfoff margaritas — an incentive that brings her and her friends in. “They have really good trivia, margaritas halfoff, and I really like doing that,” Moore said, “I like Urban Tap. I love trivia night. I like to have something to do.” After exploring Pittsburgh, Carson said it’s much easier to decide which settings are “more your speed.” For Carson, her “heart will always be with 5801,” a gay bar in Shadyside. “I like that bar specifically because you can go and talk with people, but you can also go and dance,” Carson said, “I really like that kind of dynamic to it, but I also enjoy the safety of it. I feel 10 times safer if I’m at a gay bar than if I’m at a straight bar.” Another bar that offers some niche experiences, according to Carson, is Spirit, located in Lawrenceville. While there is a cover fee to get in, the bar offers guests spaghetti if they stay past midnight. “It’s because it’s also a restaurant, so at midnight, instead of throwing out all of their leftover food, they just give it out to people,” Carson said, “Sometimes they’ll have pizza. My friends go and wait in line early to make sure that they get their spaghetti and stuff.” "", ""Despite students having the freedom to choose anywhere they want to go off campus, for 2021 Pitt graduate Stephanie Bisignano, having the convenience of oncampus bars “was amazing.” “It was just right there and you could just drunk walk home, and you were fine,” Bisignano said. “It was pretty much the place where you knew that everyone was going to congregate at — and Hem’s was always that. Come back from a club meeting, come back from class, or even just walking by — it’s in the middle of everything.” Another benefit of having bars “so close to home,” for Bisignano, is the latenight food options available in Oakland. To cater to students, there are many restaurants open until 2 a.m., including Frenchie’s, Ocha Thai Noodle, El Jefe’s and Pizza Romano. “In Pittsburgh, there’s not a lot of places to get food after a certain time, and Oakland has that,” Bisignano said. “That’s a huge point for why we would stay oncampus instead of going to offcampus bars.” Bisignano highlights the “variety” of experiences that people have to choose from, whether they decide to stay oncampus or go offcampus. “Sometimes we just want to get away from being around other college students too, so [going offcampus] was the escape,” Bisignano said. “The most random place would sometimes be the best spot to get away.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV26," Students share favorite date spots in Pittsburgh By Emily Handrahan, Staff Writer As Cupid prepares to draw his bow, students at Pitt are on the hunt for the ideal date spot. From museums to restaurants and charming boutique shops, Pittsburgh presents a myriad of options for students to create unforgettable moments with their special someone. Firstyears Bryonna Ross and Gideon Tsoutsouris, going on six months of dating, enjoy visiting the UPMC Rink at PPG Place. The ice rink is open until Feb. 25 and is located in the center of the Pittsburgh skyline, a 30minute bus ride from campus. Kaylee Uribe | Staff Photographer “We discovered this place on Instagram and it’s special Walnut Street in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. because we get to celebrate the holidays in downtown Pittsburgh, skating outside under beautiful lights,” Ross, a nursing major, said. “A perfect date spot to us is somewhere we can just be us, have some fun and spend some quality time together.” Ross also added that since the PPG ice rink is in downtown Pittsburgh, there are a lot of sights and new stores to explore in the area. With a Pitt ID, students can skate for $5.50 on Wednesdays. With Valentine’s Day coincidentally falling on a Wednesday, students looking to celebrate the holiday will also be able to use the discount. Some couples prefer going to the movies, a classic date spot for a more laidback experience. Helena Gable, a firstyear psychology major, has been with her partner for over three years and said their favorite date location is Row House Cinema, a small theater in Pittsburgh located on Butler Street in Lawrenceville. “The two closest movie theaters to campus are Manor Theatre and Row House Cinema, and they are both independently owned, so they show new movies and even cult classics,” Gable said. Gable mentioned that both cinemas have vintage decor, and Manor Theatre offers a small student discount to those who show their student ID. “My favorite memory is when we first went to Row House Cinema and saw ‘Dune,’” Gable said. “I thought it was cool that they were showing movies that had already been released, and they also had so many fun snacks and drinks.” Gable added that her and her partner go to the movies about once a month. “Back home, we went to the same few movie theaters, so when we first came to campus, we knew we needed to find a new place to go,” Gable said. “The first week of classes, we looked up what theaters would be closest to us, and we hopped on the bus. Both theaters are surrounded by adorable restaurants and shops, so we love making a day out of it.” Gable said what makes a perfect date spot is finding something that both partners equally enjoy and allows them to relax and enjoy each other’s company. “Find something that makes you excited and look forward to being with your partner,” Gable said. "", ""If students are looking for a cheaper date, some Pittsburgh museums are free for students with their Pitt ID. Pitt students can visit museums like the Mattress Factory, Andy Warhol Museum and the Carnegie Museum of Art and Natural History and more free of charge. Going on dates with friends is another way many people, including Rece Eddy, spend Valentine’s Day. Eddy, a firstyear neuroscience major, said her favorite “date” spot to visit with friends is Walnut Street in Shadyside. Walnut Street is best known for its mix of national retailers like Apple, Sephora and Lululemon and independent boutiques like Kards Unlimited and Roberta Weisberg. It is about a 10minute bus ride to Walnut Street from campus. “I think it’s such a good friend date spot because it’s a pretty street with a lot of little shops and boutiques and it has a lot of local cafes and restaurants,” Eddy said. Eddy mentioned that Walnut Street is better than going to the mall because it’s outside, and she prefers it to Downtown because it is quiet and peaceful and there are fewer cars. “The first time I went there with a friend, it was still warm and sunny,” Eddy said. “We took the bus there and we walked around all the shops and got pizza after.” When asked what makes the perfect date, Eddy said, “It’s about the people you go with and the memories you make there.” "" )",Lawrenceville,event,2020-2025
PN_LV27," Campus Life | Favorite Bakeries in Pittsburgh Campus Life is a biweekly blog about the everyday things happening around Pitt’s campus. By Shriya Yadamreddi, Senior Staff Writer One thing that will always make my day is a freshly baked treat, especially on a chilly day. Recently, I’ve loved to explore Pittsburgh’s bakeries and, to my surprise, there are so many surrounding us. Each bakery I visited had its own unique charm accompanied by tasty goods. One of my newly found favorite bakeries is Vanilla Pastry Studio, a cupcakecentered bakery located on Centre Ave. I was never a big cupcake person until my friends took me to this studio, and I have been obsessed with it ever since. They have so many unique flavor combinations that you can choose from, like Chocolate and Espresso, Vanilla and Dulce de Leche, Mango and Passionfruit and many more. What sets this bakery apart is the beautiful custom wedding cakes on display that are stunning to look at. Along with the intriguing cakes, they also make cake pops in many flavors. The next time you find yourself near Target or Trader Joe’s, make sure to stop by Vanilla Pastry Studio to grab a cupcake, or maybe two! TPN File Illustration A classic bakery in Pittsburgh that you have most likely heard of is Prantl’s Bakery on Walnut Street in Shadyside. They have many locations, but this is the closest one to Pitt’s campus. Prantl’s has many baked options. Cannolis, danishes, cupcakes, coffee cakes — the list goes on. Their iconic Burnt Almond Torte was hailed as “The Best Cake in America” and is something you need to try when you go. They have different variations of the dessert, such as Raspberry Torte, Torte Pastry Cream and Toasted Almond Cake Bars. I got a few of these desserts for my roommate’s birthday a few months ago and it was a total crowdpleaser. Another popular place that is known for its desserts is “Peace, Love and Little Donuts” in the Strip District. They have so many funky flavors, such as Salted Caramel Macchiato and Strawberry French Toast, but also have classic donut flavors like Boston Cream and Maple Bacon. One of the things I love most about this place is that their donuts are small, making it easy to sample a variety of flavors without it being too overwhelming. They have mini donuts for dogs as well, which is perfect if you decide to bring your pet. And if their donuts being perfect wasn’t enough, they also give their customers a free Cinnamon Sugar donut when you walk in, which of course tastes amazing. One of the very first bakeries I tried in Pittsburgh was La Gourmandine on Butler Street in Lawrenceville. They have multiple locations, including Downtown and Homestead, but the one in Lawrenceville is my favorite. This luxurious bakery has many pastries such as eclairs, macarons and tartes, which all come in unique flavors. Along with their sweet treats, they also have an impressive savory menu, which consists of different types of baguette sandwiches and boulangerie bread. My favorite thing to get from their menu is their caprese sandwich along with a breakfast Danish, which I always pair with a coffee. I don’t know about you, but that combination is the best way to start your day.

PN_LV28," Row House Cinema hosts Polish Film Festival for the first time By Aoqin Yan, Staff Writer For Northeastern University graduate student Alexander Kong, the Polish Film Festival is worth flying all the way from Boston to Pittsburgh during a weekday in order to watch movies that remind him of the Polish half of his upbringing. “It’s just so exciting for me because my mother is Polish. Even though I didn’t speak a word of the language, I always thought I should at least have some exposure to my own culture, maybe through watching movies,” Kong said. “It might sound crazy to you, but there weren’t any events like this in Boston, so I just flew to Pittsburgh and I still have classes tomorrow afternoon. I thought it’s a great chance for me to learn about the Polish culture that also belongs to part Image via Wikimedia Commons of who I am.” Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville. This year, the Polish Film Festival is taking place at Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville Tuesday to Friday. The festival presents five Polish films, “Never Gonna Snow Again,” “EO,” “Sonata,” “The Double Life of Véronique” and “Europa Europa.” Three of these movies are debuting in Pittsburgh for the first time. “Sonata,” the first movie shown during the festival on Tuesday evening, is about a musician who was mistakenly diagnosed as autistic when he was a child. Later in life, he discovers that he has an impeccable musical talent. Kong said he watched “Sonata” before coming to the festival, but he would recommend the film because of its moving story and the fact that it makes the audience think, rather than merely entertaining them. “This movie came in last year, and the story was fantastic. It is more than just a movie for fun, but it also makes you think and encourages you,” Kong said. “I can’t imagine a person having his childhood without any hearing and being mistaken for autism, but is still able to develop his talent in music. The efforts and the challenges he overcame is impressive.” Pittsburgh’s Polish Cultural Council hosted the festival. The organization originated nearly 80 years ago in Western Pennsylvania at the time when there was a huge Polish immigrant community. Though the Polish community shrunk over time, the Council is still dedicated to promoting Polish culture through cinematographic works by collaborating with local theaters. Maria Staszkiewicz, the executive director of Polish Cultural Council, said the Council has wanted to organize the festival for decades — this is the first time they are collaborating with Row House Cinema. “We started a few presentations more than 15 years ago, mostly as a sidebar for Three Rivers Film Festival, which was run by Pittsburgh filmmakers,” Staszkiewicz said. “This is our first return after the pandemic since 2019. And we used to work with filmmakers, the manager of Harris Theater, which is one of the former filmmakers we have a relationship with, and the other theater we started for the first time, which is the Row House Cinema on Butler Street.” Staszkiewicz also mentioned that Polish culture is still not yet well known by locals, and it is the organization’s mission to introduce and promote their culture to the public. She added the main content for this year’s festival is the Krzysztof Kieślowski retrospective. “We just feel that there is a lot about our culture that is not known in this part of the United States,” Staszkiewicz said. “A big chunk of our presentation is the Krzysztof Kieślowski retrospective. In June, there was a 4K restoration of his famous trilogy ‘Three Colors.’ He made the three movies black, white and red. And they are made in France, but they have many Polish actors also.” Staszkiewicz added that she especially recommends watching “EO” because it distinctly tells the story from an animal’s perspective. "", ""“Krzysztof Kieślowski’s movies are almost all gone now because they were in last week, but there’s still ‘The Double Life of Véronique.’” Staszkiewicz said. “I would say ‘EO’ is a special one, not a typical film. It’s a donkey’s name, and [the movie] almost had no dialogue at all. This movie is made from the perspective of an animal — this is why it has very little dialogue and the idea was the protection of animals.” Kelsey Zehmisch, the marketing manager of Row House Cinema, said she is excited that the theater is hosting the film festival. “This is actually the first time we’re presenting [the Polish Film Festival] at Row House. Our goal is to present really unique programs that you’re not going to see in local chain movie theaters,” Zehmisch said. “Hopefully, you’ll discover a new favorite movie or watch something you maybe wouldn’t have watched on your own.” Staszkiewicz and Zehmisch agreed that watching movies at home and from the cinema is completely different due to the atmosphere and environment. As an exfilm shooter, Zehmisch said watching movies in a theater can make it a collective experience. “We really believe that watching a movie at home versus watching a movie in a small theater are two vastly different experiences,” Zehmisch said. “It’s really great that people can come together and enjoy movies in the theater setting with other people. It makes it more fun, it makes it a collective experience. We think there’s a lot of value in that, from an exshooter’s standpoint.” "" )",Lawrenceville,event,2020-2025
PN_LV29," Pittburgh’s new Refillery aims to limit singleuse plastic, promote zerowaste By Maya Valletta, Staff Writer The Refillery is making a lowwaste and sustainable lifestyle more accessible to Pittsburgh. The owner, Larissa Russo, opened the zerowaste store in Squirrel Hill a little less than a year ago, after seeing a need in the Pittsburgh community for an alternative to singleuse plastic. She said she wanted to create a solution that would support local businesses and is accessible to consumers. “It came down to the fact that Pittsburgh didn’t have any dedicated stores like this yet,” Russo said. At The Refillery, customers bring or buy empty containers to reuse and refill them with personal and home products such Aaiush Jain | Staff Photographer as soaps, skincare, cleaning products and kitchen supplies. The Refillery in Squirrel Hill on Murray Avenue. Customers fill containers as desired and pay by weight. Russo said she first tested the idea of refillable products by applying to The Neighborhood Flea, a popup market in the Strip District, and the public loved the concept. “Pittsburgh really, really showed up and loved it,” Russo said. When creating the company, Russo said her main priority was making products accessible, as well as building a space where the community could come together to make a change. Russo said she envisions using the store for events and popups such as a women in business breakfast series and various workshops and lectures. “We really want to use our space, not just as a store, but a place to come together around the idea of living a zerowaste lifestyle,” Russo said. Russo takes great care when sourcing products. She said the store only carries ethically made products, meaning the workers get paid a livable wage and work in safe conditions, and the products are made sustainably in a way that doesn’t harm the environment. “The three pillars that really drive our decisions are everything being ethical, sustainable and local,” Russo said. Meeting this standard can sometimes make it harder to source specific products. Russo said it’s sometimes a challenge to find a product that is manufactured locally and ethically but still has a price point that is accessible. “We’ve had to delay getting some items, for example metal straws,” Russo said. “For them to meet the standards for me to carry, I haven’t been able to find that yet.” Russo partners with many small businesses in the Pittsburgh area for sourcing. Chez Lapin in Lawrenceville supplies The Refillery with refillable candles. The owner of the candle company, Claire Landuyt, began making candles and skincare 10 years ago and created Chez Lapin five years ago. Landuyt said the partnership is a big success. “We’ve been doing her refillable candles, of course, which works with her refillable vibe and business as well as my ecofriendly business,” Landuyt said. A big priority for Landuyt is to make Chez Lapin as sustainable as possible. The brand does not package their products in an effort to reduce waste. "", ""“I think candle packaging is incredibly wasteful,” Landuyt said. Chez Lapin’s products sold in retail are in recycled, letterpressed dust covers that are locally sourced and recyclable. To reduce carbon emissions, Landuyt sources her ingredients and materials locally or from neighboring states. “I take great pride in only sourcing ingredients that are sustainably harvested or produced or manufactured,” Landuyt said. “A lot of our botanicals we are planting, drying and harvesting ourselves for our products.” Landuyt said she gets a lot of inspiration for products from her time spent in France. Landuyt embodies certain French Aaiush Jain | Staff Photographer landscapes, meals or drinks through her products as well as the slow French lifestyle and indulgence in simple pleasures like coffee. “I spent a lot of time in France, and I’ve always loved France,” Landuyt said. “I’ve always wanted a piece of that here at home with me in the States.” Chez Lapin and The Refillery have partnered for two candle refill events, with another one planned for December. Landuyt comes into The Refillery and refills customer’s candles right on the spot. Customers vote on which four fragrances they want to see at the refilling events, and then bring in their empty candle jars to get refilled with their desired amount and fragrance of candle wax. “This past time we filled almost 100 candles,” Landuyt said. “That’s 100 candle Aaiush Jain | Staff Photographer jars that we’ve put in people’s homes that weren’t produced or wasted.” Keeping a consistent focus on local business, Russo said she’s interested in a businesstobusiness model, so The Refillery recently launched a platform for businesses to buy products in bulk. The process began this month, and Goodlander Cocktail Brewery was the first company to order. “We are still very much getting started with it,” Russo said. “But I can definitely see the desire for it.” The owner of the brewery, Wes Shonk, opened Goodlander Cocktail Brewery in the Larimer neighborhood, adjacent to Bakery Square, but the company also does events around the city. “We say a cocktail brewery is very similar to a traditional brewery,” Shonk said. “We just make kegs of cocktails instead of beer.” Shonk said he created the cocktail brewery with a business model surrounding lowwaste beverages. “We use real, fresh ingredients,” Shonk said. “All our spent produce is composted.” In addition to using lowwaste ingredients, Goodlander Cocktail Brewery also specializes in reusable and refillable containers. The drinks come in kegs that customers wash and refill. "", ""In an effort to reduce even more singleuse plastic, Shonk said Goodlander Cocktail Brewery buys refillable hand soap and vinegar from The Refillery. Shonk recognized that these are frequently used products, and continually purchasing gallons of hand soap or vinegar accumulates a lot of plastic. “We all need to use soap, and it’s frustrating when every soap available is packaged in singleuse packaging,” Shonk said. Shonk said The Refillery specializes in hardtofind products, like white vinegar, and switching to refillable products is beneficial in producing less waste which is a big goal for his company. “I know the concept is popular in other larger cities, and I’m very delighted that Pittsburgh has a refillery,” Shonk said. He has seen the positive effects of switching to refillable products, and recommends other companies do the same. “I think the quality is just as good, and the price is basically the same and you don’t have a piece of waste at the end of it,” Shonk said. “I recommend that all companies switch to refillable products in any category where it’s possible.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025
PN_LV30," Deep inside the world of vaginal rejuvenation By Charlie Taylor, Senior Staff Writer The term “vaginal rejuvenation” may conjure up comical images of excessive selfcare — vulva face masks, labia salt scrubs, pHbalancing bath bombs — but these treatments are real cosmetic procedures currently being performed in Pittsburgh. Roxana Barad, an aesthetic physician at the Aesthetic Skin and Laser Center in Lawrenceville, specializes in vaginal rejuvenation, a broad term that includes many procedures that vary in their administration and results. Generally, they aim to tighten the vagina, stop incontinence and improve sexual pleasure, though scholarly research into their effectiveness is lacking. One example is the Orgasm Shot, or OShot, an injection of plateletrich plasma derived from the patient’s blood into tissues surrounding the urethra and clitoris. PRP is also used Promiti Debi | Staff Illustrator to treat sports injuries under the belief that it encourages the growth of new tissue, but clinical studies have yet to prove its effectiveness. Barad described the PRP in an OShot as stimulating the cells to produce new energy and collagen, leading to improved orgasms. “[The OShot] stimulates new collagen and tightens things up,” she said. “[The cells] behave more youthfully, and, for someone who’s having issues with orgasm, the OShot in combination with [radio frequency] can increase sexual pleasure.” Radio frequency is used in ThermiVa, a noninvasive treatment, to heat the outer labia, stimulating collagen production and tightening the surrounding area. Barad said this procedure appeals to patients because it’s painless. “We can tighten [the labia] using a radio frequency modality. It’s painless. We don’t have to numb [patients] for it,” she said. “We do it in a certain way that the heat doesn’t accumulate in a particular area.” As of 2018, the Food and Drug Administration had not determined that energybased vaginal rejuvenation devices could offer any health benefits or treat vaginal laxity and incontinence. The FDA has also linked these procedures to complications like scarring, chronic pain and painful intercourse. However, according to Barad, ThermiVa poses little risk of burning the patient as long as it is administered by a professional. “There’s a theoretical issue that if [the treatment] is not done properly, you can burn someone,” she said. “It’s just never happened to us. You just need to make sure it’s being done in a safe environment.” Megan Bradley, a resident at MageeWomen’s hospital and an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, said that she agrees that other than burns, no real risks have been found for radio frequency treatments — but there is also little data to support the supposed noncosmetic benefits of either ThermiVa or OShot. The danger has less to do with definite risks than with lack of research into the treatments. “[Gynecologists] really try and not rely on procedures until there’s large randomizedcontrol data for [them], and, unfortunately for [vaginal rejuvenation], that doesn’t exist yet,” Bradley said. “When patients ask about them, as opposed to talking about the risks, we tend to focus a little bit more on the lack of efficacy data.” "", ""For patients with incontinence, Bradley recommends treatments that have been more heavily researched. She said women might first want to consider other methods — like physical therapy, pessaries, overthecounter products and surgical options — both because scientific studies can actually attest to their effectiveness and because they tend to be cheaper. “Given lack of highquality data, and the fact that [rejuvenation] is not covered by insurance, [patients] just really have to think about the efficacy implications,” she said. Loose skin and incontinence are associated with menopause, and vaginal rejuvenation is commonly thought of as appealing to older individuals. But, Barad said, it can offer benefits to all ages, and the increased sensitivity associated with these treatments may appeal to college students. She said that she sees vaginal rejuvenation as part of a larger narrative of selfdiscovery and sex positivity. “Even young people sometimes have laxity and need to be tightened a little bit, which will increase sexual pleasure,” she said. “For some college kids that come from a conservative home, even learning how to masturbate or learning what pleasures them [is important].” Beyond increased sensitivity, treatments like ThermiVa and the OShot may improve sex lives by bolstering selfconfidence. According to Barad, to get the most out of sex, it’s important that people feel comfortable and confident with their bodies. “Part of the whole sexual function is comfort with the way you look,” she said. “If you feel more comfortable with your appearance, it might relieve the anxiety that someone feels that prevents them from reaching orgasm.” Katherine McGuigan, a sophomore double majoring in political science and communication and an active member of the Pitt Planned Parenthood club, said she felt that the cosmetic purposes of vaginal rejuvenation reinforced the domination of men over women. She said she wondered whether these procedures are worth the risk of potential complications. “[Vaginal rejuvenation] sounds like it might give in to heteronormative and patriachal standpoints,” she said. “[It’s] doing everything just to benefit the person you’re having sex with, which is a man if you’re dealing with penetration. It doesn’t sound safe. It just sounds like giving in to other peoples’ [expectations]. According to Katherine Scott, the director of clinical care at Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania, women who undergo vaginal rejuvenation often falsely believe that their vagina looks strange or unhealthy. “[Patients] interested in vaginal or vulvar cosmetic procedures may be under the impression that their body or genital appearance isn’t healthy or normal. Vulvas come in a lot of different shapes and sizes and there is a wide variety of healthy variations,” Scott said in an email. Scott also said rejuvenation might not always increase sexual pleasure and warned against making uninformed decisions about sexual health. “If people have concerns about their sexual function, there are a variety of safer and less invasive ways to treat this, like pelvic floor physical therapy,” she said. “We would encourage anyone considering this type of procedure to talk to their reproductive and sexual health provider before having surgery.” "" )",Lawrenceville,retail,2020-2025

PN_LV32," Places to shop for backtoschool clothes in Pittsburgh By Nadiya Greaser, Staff Writer Backtoschool is here, and backtoschool shopping is finally happening in person. After a year of mostly online shopping, the idea of trying on a jacket in a real dressing room is inordinately exciting, and students in Pittsburgh have plenty of dressing rooms to choose from. There are local boutiques, vintage and secondhand shops in nearly every neighborhood in the ‘Burgh and each has something unique to offer. Whether you’re looking for a specific pair of vintage denim, a new sundress or just browsing, each of these shops has a variety of options and the best way to find what you like is to try more than one. Take the bus or go for a quick bike ride outside of Oakland to see what these shops have to offer. Kaycee Orwig | Senior Staff Photographer There are local boutique, vintage and secondhand shops in nearly every Avalon Exchange (Squirrel Hill) neighborhood in the ‘Burgh and each has something unique to offer. This vintage and resale shop in Squirrel Hill has a mix of vintage, designer and contemporary fast fashion brands. This means you’ll find Fjallraven backpacks next to Gucci clutches, and Forever 21 faux leather jackets next to vintage Levi’s denim and Diesel.

PN_LV33," Pickett returns to roots in NIL deal with Boys and Girls Club By Jon Moss, EditorinChief Kenny Pickett had a bit of a homecoming Monday afternoon — but it wasn’t by going back to his native New Jersey. Pitt’s starting quarterback was back at the Boys and Girls Club, a staple of his youth, to give out some free “Pickett’s Partners” tshirts and toss around some footballs at the Estelle S. Campbell clubhouse in Lawrenceville. The shirts are part of a collaboration between Pickett, PGT Trucking and custom apparel company Ithen USA, with the shirt sale proceeds going to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania. “My grandfather did work in Asbury Park and he kind of Jon Moss | EditorinChief introduced me to it and got me involved, [when I was] like Kenny Pickett talks with kids on Monday afternoon at the Boys and Girls seven or eight years old,” Pickett said. “I was going there Club in Lawrenceville. growing up and I met one of my best friends there.” The deal is one of several name, image and likeness agreements that Pickett has inked, including with the Oaklander Hotel to get his offensive line a weekly “hog dinner” at the hotel’s restaurant, car dealership Bowser Automotive and radio station 93.7 The Fan. While Pickett said NIL deals are a great opportunity for athletes to “make money for themselves,” he thinks athletes should not just be enriching themselves. “I think it’s also a great opportunity to give back and, you know, spread the wealth, and enjoy with people you hold dear, like the offensive linemen and now this organization,” Pickett said. He added that he wants to focus on football with the season approaching, but hinted that further deals could be announced towards the end of the season. Scott Koskoski, the vice president of advancement for the Boys and Girls Clubs, said the organization will use Pickett’s donation to fund programming across its 14 clubhouses in Allegheny and Somerset counties. He said the organization has seen a doubling in its number of children served and physical locations during the COVID19 pandemic, turning into “learning hubs” for some. “We will absolutely use these proceeds to directly benefit the afterschool and outofschool time experiences of the 12,000 children that we serve,” Koskoski said. Koskoski added that he has seen many athletes with NIL deals focused on “maximizing opportunities to make money or to grow their own brand,” but Pickett has “expressed a desire to be very philanthropic and very … oriented to the community.” “He clearly cares a lot about Pittsburgh and cares a lot about the youth of this City,” Koskoski said. “He’s here doing something he didn’t have to do, and we’re very grateful for that.” ",Lawrenceville,outreach/nonprofit organization,2020-2025
PN_LV34," Editorial | Gainey is a necessary change for Pittsburgh By The Pitt News Editorial Board Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd one year ago yesterday. Ed Gainey, the Democratic nominee for mayor of Pittsburgh, acknowledged this solemn anniversary three times on Twitter and called on the U.S. Senate to pass the Justice in Policing Act. Mayor Bill Peduto, who lost last week’s primary to Gainey after a shellacking in the city’s more heavily Black and progressive neighborhoods, was silent. At least, he was silent about Floyd. Peduto retweeted posts about bike lanes, a deck hockey rink and how “Pittsburgh’s food scene is heating up” — not a peep about Floyd. Image via Matt Cashore | Gainey for Mayor Twitter is hardly the endall beall of racial justice. But Peduto staying mum one year after the killing is a microcosm of his mayorship, or at least its waning years. He’s put down young activists, defended indefensible actions by City police and made a habit of playing Bill knows best instead of accepting criticism. It frequently felt as if serious issues were a second priority to the minutiae of city government and making himself into a liberal national hero. The primary results can be analyzed any way you’d like, but at the end of the day Gainey won because he was willing to not only make rhetorical space, but push for tangible change on the fundamental issues plaguing Pittsburgh — racial justice, a lack of affordable housing and police brutality. We won’t deny touches of questionability on Gainey’s record or lack of concrete policy on some issues, but we also won’t deny that he’s the person for this job, at this moment. Only 23% of Pittsburgh is African American, yet Black people account for 65% of all arrests in the City — a startling fact oftcited by Gainey. Furthermore, the City Police has worse racial disparities in use of deadly force than 96% of departments and more police officers per 10,000 residents than 88% of departments, according to The Police Scorecard. Gainey has pledged to end the use of military gear by City police officers, overhaul police training, work to strengthen the Citizen Police Review Board and, most importantly, divert resources into community policing strategies rather than over policing. Notice the absence of dithering task forces and committees that defined Peduto’s response to the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Furthermore, Gainey will implement citywide inclusionary zoning, which mandates that developers offer a percentage of units to lowincome renters in an effort to combat gentrification and the rampant displacement of Black residents. He also plans to redevelop dilapidated housing in the City’s land banks to provide safe, affordable housing that will bolster Pittsburgh’s tax rolls. Peduto himself admitted that he’s “bat .500” on housing over his eight years as mayor. Even the hits, such as an inclusionary zoning pilot program in Lawrenceville, were hardly spectacular. Gainey has also been willing to address racial inequality in all aspects of governance — not just the police. Notably, he said he’ll be focused on environmental justice, indicating a focus on bringing vulnerable communities along in a transition to clean energy and sustainability. It’s time for a mayor who will take bold, direct action to combat the heavily intertwined housing and racial justice crises in Pittsburgh, not tinker around the edges with pilots and task forces. With Gainey all but certain to become mayor in January 2022, we truly have the chance to become a model City. Peduto mostly seemed interested in saying we’re already there — more police officers and all. ",Lawrenceville,displacement/gentrification,2020-2025

UT_CB01,"Peggie Dunklin always helped others, even in the face of adversity | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Peggie Dunklin always helped others, even in the face of adversity Friday, January 14, 2022 Margaret “Peggie” Miller Dunklin, 55 — a 33year Pitt employee, including the last nine years as director of budget and human resources for the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid (OAFA) — died Dec. 7, 2021. “She brought the Pitt to it,” Marc Harding said of Dunklin’s work here. Harding, head of OAFA, recalled that “Peggie’s love of Pitt really shone through. She was one of the foundational workers for the work she did.” That’s why her office was next to his, he said. “It's important for a person in that position to hear everything that is going on. It was a very, very large job,” since Dunklin was responsible for the administration of OAFA work toward new undergraduate enrollment for the Pittsburgh campus and financial aid for all students, as well as oversight of OAFA’s 107 employees, including a direct supervisory role over several. “She handled all new hire processes and staff development for the office” as well as the 200 Pathfinder student tour guides overseen by OAFA. “She also knew how to balance a budget to the dime … If staff traveled and needed reimbursements, or the department needed to pay for muffins for guests, or purchasing for the office,” Dunklin handled it expertly, he said. “Peggie knew how to juggle all this responsibility,” he added. However, “she was first and foremost known as a compassionate staff member. It was her ability to connect with people, her caring, her kindness. … I witnessed her dealing with every human resources issue. If someone fainted, she was there. … She would make sure staff felt connected and engaged and she was part of creating as welcoming and inviting a culture as any unit of the University. “It was so much more than just a job for her,” Harding said. “Pitt was her life.” Her office was decorated with Pitt sports memorabilia and she could often be seen at Pitt games and in Pitt gear. Peggie Dunklin was one of 11 children, all of whom attended Pitt. Her father, John Miller, worked as a superintendent of maintenance in Tower A, and her sister Katie is now a dental hygienist working at Pitt, meaning that the Miller family has worked a total of 75 years here. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/passings/peggiedunklinalways 1/3 "", ""Peggie Dunklin always helped others, even in the face of adversity | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Dunklin’s brothers Jack and Mike were lettermen in Pitt baseball, and her daughter Maura graduated from Pitt and now conducts research at MageeWomens Hospital.

OAFA in turn has created a permanent endowed scholarship fund in her name — the Peggie Miller Memorial Fund — to raise at least $25,000 before Feb. 21, 2022. It will support at least two undergraduate students with financial need from the Pittsburgh area with $500 book awards each year. The fund has raised nearly $17,000 so far. Dunklin was a lifelong Pittsburgher, growing up in Cranberry and moving to Oakdale to raise her own family. Born June 9, 1966 to the late John F. Miller Jr. and Ruth Rodgers Miller, she graduated from Seneca Valley High School (1984) and then earned her bachelor’s degree in communications at Pitt (1988) and a Master of Law Studies degree here just last year. Her Pitt career included work in the Office of University Communications and Marketing before joining OAFA. “One of Peggie’s greatest legacies,” recalled Harding, “is her affinity to help others, even in the face of adversity. Two weeks before Peggie’s death, she asked me to visit her. … She looked at me and made me promise that after she passes, I would remind the entire staff of two important things: to bank their sick time because you never know when you’re going to need it, and to make sure you put as much money as possible away toward retirement. She told me this as she was trying to manage through great pain, and sadness. This was Peggie.

Pitt football coach Pat Narduzzi might have said it best: “When people talk about Pitt legends, Dr. Freddie Fu should absolutely be included in that discussion. He was the best in the world at what he did. So many of Pitt's greatest athletes were blessed to have been treated and cared for by Dr. Fu. Not only was he a gifted doctor, but also someone who was personally invested in every person and patient he worked with. On behalf of our entire football program, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to his family and many loved ones.” Pitt held a moment of silence in honor of Fu before the Panthers football game against the University of New Hampshire on Sept. 25 at Heinz Field. Players for all of Pitt’s athletic teams wore patches with “FF” on them in the week following his death. On Oct. 1, a standingroomonly crowd at Heinz Chapel gathered for a memorial service for Fu, while another 100 or so watched the service via livestream in Alumni Hall across Fifth Avenue. Some celebrants traveled from Europe and Asia to attend the 70minute service and to pose afterward for a team photograph of Fu pupils. Fu founded Western Pennsylvania’s first sports medicine program in 1986 in a small suite near Pitt’s main campus. In 2000, after outgrowing a second, bigger location, the UPMC Center for Sports Medicine moved into a newly built 37,000squarefoot building on Pittsburgh’s South Side, within the 60 acres now known as the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex. In 2015, Fu guided a partnership between UPMC and the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins to build a sports medicine and training facility in Cranberry Township — the UPMC Lemieux Sports. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/tributesfreddiefupour 1/5 "", ""Tributes to Freddie Fu pour in from all corners | University Times | University of Pittsburgh As an internationally renowned orthopaedic scientist and surgeon, Fu helped revolutionize anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and is extoled specifically for his relentless scientific research and clinical expertise in treating ACL injuries, common in athletes of all ages and skill levels. For 32 years, Fu was the head team physician for Pitt’s Athletic Department and for 37 years, he was company physician for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. Fu is survived by his wife of 47 years, Hilda Pang Fu; his daughter, Joyce LokSee Fu (and husband, Chad Martin); son, Gordon KaHong Fu (and wife, Ding Li); five grandchildren: Ludivine LingYun Fu Martin, Alexander ZeeYun Fu Martin, Axel WeiYun Fu Martin, Kendrick Kai Cheng Fu and Kasen Kai Sheng Fu; his mother, Mabel Foo; sisters Susan Lam and Jeanette Maeba; and brothers Frank Fu and Nigel Fu.

Here’s just some of the tributes: “Freddie was known worldwide as a brilliant orthopaedic surgeon and a leader in the field of sports medicine. He was also a committed teacher and mentor, and he leaves behind a global community of former students, residents and colleagues who continue to heal and reshape medicine.

UT_FH01,"Professor’s eighth book shares stories of women struggling as adjuncts  Professor’s eighth book shares stories of women struggling as adjuncts Thursday, November 14, 2024 By SHANNON O. WELLS As the awardwinning author of eight books, and dozens of essays, stories, poems and reviews, Dave Newman could easily draw from his own creative process, publishing experiences, and encouraging reviews to inspire and impress students in his Pitt– Greensburg classroom. That, however, is not Newman’s style. “I never even talk about my own work,” the assistant professor of creative and professional writing says. “I had a teacher when I was an undergraduate who taught one of his books, and it was the most uncomfortable class I’d ever been in. What do you say? ‘Great! Good job!’ You know? It was uncomfortable.” Sure, students in the know occasionally ask about his creations and how they came to life. “I always tell them, ‘You can have a book (of mine) when you graduate. I’ll give you a copy, because my books are pretty … rated ‘R’, working class, kind of gritty,” Newman explains. “A lot of the students, they’ve never seen grit on the page, and it’s probably better they don’t see it from their teacher and then come to class with that experience: ‘Like, Is this guy a scum bucket? I don’t know?’ “So I tamp that down.” This year, it’s been increasingly difficult for Newman to keep attention and accolades at bay. In July, Newman published his eighth book, “She Throws Herself Forward to Stop the Fall,” described as the “last in a trilogy about workingclass people trying to better themselves through education.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/professorseighthbook 1/5 "", ""Professor’s eighth book shares stories of women struggling as adjuncts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh In late September, Newman received the 2024 Alumnus of Distinction Award from the Pitt– Greensburg Alumni Association. The award acknowledges excellence among Pitt– Greensburg alumni, with candidates evaluated on their “outstanding level of professional achievement, service to the community, service to the University of Pittsburgh, special recognition or honors, and any other special efforts or success.” The association calls the award the highest honor it bestows annually on an individual alumnus/alumna. The recognition caught Newman completely unaware. “It’s funny. My speech was basically about how much I hate to give speeches. But thank you, Pitt–Greensburg, for giving me a public speaking class 30 years ago,” he quips. “It’s really paying off now.” The Western Pennsylvania native shared a more reverent take in September with on the Pitt–Greensburg website. “I’m really honored,” he says. “Pitt–Greensburg people go out into the world and do great stuff. One alumnus, Austin Davis, is the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Another alumnus, Justin Merriman, is a brilliant photographer whose work I constantly follow. I’m proud to have graduated from here and feel even better about coming back to teach.” That said, the genial, unassuming Newman, who graduated from the Greensburg campus in 1993 with a bachelor’s degree in English writing, comes across as one who writes and teaches simply for the joy and satisfaction of doing it. ‘Tough gig’ That outlook is reflected in “She Throws Herself Forward to Stop the Fall.” The collection of fictional stories focuses on women working as adjunct professors “while augmenting their meager earnings in malls, bars and restaurants,” as described by publisher Roadside Press. “They are middleaged and live at home. They want to be writers. They want to be cops. Their boyfriends smoke crack and get lost. Their dads work in factories,” the description reads. “Their grandfathers die without warning. Nothing is safe but everything will be fine. Go to class. Grab a cigarette. Pick up a broom. These are the stories of dreams and the endless work people do to survive.” While not blaming any particular institution, Newman makes no bones about his belief that adjunct instructors are treated pretty poorly for the valuable service they provide. “I have very strong feelings about it. I think it’s terrible the way they treat adjuncts,” he says. “Adjuncts are often super invested, because they believe that at the end of adjuncting, they’re going to get an opportunity for a fulltime, permanent job. And unfortunately, that’s almost never the case. In my experience, I very seldom see that.” One of the characters in the book has strong credentials, “and she just doesn’t understand how people that don’t have credentials, who maybe got hired 28 years ago, are doing so well, and she has all these credentials and can’t pay her bills and worries about putting gas in her car.” Newman believes the structure that leaves adjuncts toiling in the academic shadows has existed for the past two or three decades. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/professorseighthbook 2/5 "", ""Professor’s eighth book shares stories of women struggling as adjuncts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “It’s a tough gig,” he says. “Originally, I don’t think it was set up like that. I think it’s actually getting a little bit better, certainly at Pitt. On one hand, we’ve got a union,” which doubled the pay rate for adjunct instructors, “which is awesome … but then they got rid of a lot of adjuncts. “(Pitt–Greensburg) got rid of a journalism professor 10 days before the semester started,” he adds. “So that was disappointing.” Showing the way Newman, who grew up in Irwin and now lives nine miles away, in Trafford, highlights his geographic roots in his stories. “So I’ve been in the whole place, Western PA, my whole life. And everything I’ve written is set here,” he says. “It’s either in Pittsburgh or Greensburg or Pitcairn, or east Pittsburgh, Forest Hills, Braddock, all the little mill towns kind of east of the city. I just thought it’d be cool to put one more ding into a book.” While Newman doesn’t draw from his own writing in class, he says he likes to “teach from the places that I do write, and I try to teach the books that I love. You know, teach a wide variety of books to the students, because I teach mostly creative writing classes. “I’m usually doing fiction or poetry or some combination of the two,” he adds. “The teaching is definitely an extension of the writing and the reading, for sure. You know, figuring out things for myself and then showing the students a simpler way to get to it.” Newman strives to help students avoid the obstacles he experienced in pursuing the joys of literature and writing. “I’m from a really workingclass background, and I had a hard time in grad school,” he recalls. “I was, like, the only straight white guy in there, which was definitely not a cool thing to be at that particular moment. So it was tough for me to find my way.” After the Westmoreland Volkswagen plant closed in the 1980s, Newman’s father struggled to find reliable employment in Western Pennsylvania. He eventually moved to Detroit for a job at a Ford Motors plant. “We weren’t a family of readers or anything like that, but I was very conscious of how bluecollar life could be upturned so easily,” Newman says. “I think that’s definitely something that has gone into my work over the years. You know, even my character in one of my books, who’s a professor at the community college, he’s a former welder who got a welding degree from the community college. “Most of my characters have kind of blue collar or poorly paid white collar jobs,” he adds, “and when they’re going to school, they’re trying to educate themselves into a better life.” Eyes on the prize Early reviews of “She Throws Herself Forward to Stop the Fall” are encouraging, though Newman is realistic about the challenges in connecting with an audience juggling hyperbusy lives with all manner of visual media to keep them entertained. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/professorseighthbook 3/5 "", ""Professor’s eighth book shares stories of women struggling as adjuncts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “It’s been good so far,” he says. “It’s kind of a weird time to be a writer. I mean, just everybody is so busy. So it’s multitasking. I think it’s really hard for a lot of people who used to go to a book at the end of the night, they just go to a (digital streaming) series now, or something like that. “It’s definitely harder to get people’s attention with smaller books that don’t have big bombs going off or anything like that,” he adds. “But it’s the stuff I love to read, so it’s the stuff I write.” Most published reviews of his work are delivered courtesy of Newman’s wife, Lori Jakiela, a professor of English and creative writing at Pitt–Greensburg. “I don’t pay too much attention to the criticism or praise,” Newman says. “Sometimes my wife will read reviews and give me a synopsis of them and stuff. I just try to kind of keep an even keel.\"" Of her husband's writing style, Jakiela says she loves his \""fearlessness and ability to tell the truth.\"" \""In 'She Throws Herself Forward,' I love his ability to embody female characters in ways that ring absolutely, heartwrenchingly true,\"" she says. \""I love the way he writes about the struggles of workingclass people.\"" Noting that her father was a steelworker and Newman's an auto worker and electrician, while her mother a parttime nurse and Newman's worked for Head Start, they both grew up \""knowing the odds were stacked against people like us,\"" she says, \""but we pushed against the odds anyway. Newman writes characters that do just that. Sometimes they beat the odds, sometimes not, but the characters and their struggles always feel authentic ... \""It's important for me, and maybe other people like me, to see the experiences of my life reflected back in art, in books,\"" Jakiela adds. \""It says our lives, as messy as they are, are worthy of art. Newman writes those lives.\"" While happy to hear positive words about his work, Newman admits that what readers — including family members — think is well beyond his control once a book is released. “Usually by the time a book’s out, I’m on to the next thing,\"" he says. \""I’m really trying to focus on what’s next.” Shannon O.

Martha Ann Terry, associate professor emeritus in the School of Public Health, began to work with Peterson in the early 1990s, when Peterson was providing support for an HIV prevention research project and helped Terry figure out how the University system worked. “Mary Ann was always cheerful, with a ready hello in the morning and a positive attitude,” Terry recalled. “Mary Ann never had a bad word for anyone, and she was always willing to help out where and when needed. “I really appreciated Mary Ann’s smile, which she shared with everyone. The one word that comes to mind when I think of her is ‘light.’ I knew that if I was down, all I had to do was go next door to her office, and I’d feel better in an instant. The department wasn’t the same after she retired.” “Mary Ann was a great person to work with,” said David Arndt, with the IT Support team at Pitt Public Health. “When she worked at Public Health’s Department of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences, she was the person to see if you needed anything — office supplies, help with travel expenses. She was kind, warm and personable, and she had a great laugh and smile. If you felt down, chatting with her would make you feel better. She was the glue of the department, and she made everyone feel welcome.” Born May 8, 1932, Mary Ann Peterson grew up in Forest Hills, the daughter of the late Walter and Anna Szmyd Matusz, She was married to Edward A.

Members of the University community, Pitt’s community engagement leaders, Hill District residents, and community organizers gathered at the center, socially distanced, to celebrate the opening on May 14 and 15 at the refurbished Blakey Center. Visitors also were able to view an art gallery and participate in various breakout sessions that highlighted the center’s capabilities. The event was livestreamed on the CEC’s Facebook page. The renovations to the 9,000squarefoot space began in January 2020 and finished in February. The center, which is currently a temporary space, has six rooms, each equipped with audiovisual equipment for multipurpose programs, and a conference room and computer lab. Hill District CEC Director Kirk Holbrook said the building housing the center was special to him, and that it honors the building’s namesake, Bill Blakey, who passed away in 2014. Blakey was the “patriarch of the Hill District community, a true example of what it means to be a Hill District resident that dedicates your life to improving the neighborhood from which you came,” Holbrook said. Blakey spent more than six decades as director of the building’s previous tenant, the Hill House Association. Marlo Hall, the center’s outreach coordinator, said the center’s rooms will be available for community members and organizations to conduct learning activities and events that promote teaching and service. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/hilldistrictcecssoft 1/3 "", ""Hill District CEC’s soft opening shows off Blakey Center site | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The event also highlighted the work the center has done in the community so far since Holbrook began working out of the Bedford Hope Center in 2018. Since then, the center has helped facilitate numerous science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics programs for children and adults. It also has provided a space for residents, nonprofit organizations and other community stakeholders to connect to better serve the community. Lina Dostilio, associate vice chancellor for Community Engagement, and Paul Supowitz, vice chancellor for Community and Governmental Relations, attributed the center’s success to Hill District residents, Holbrook’s hard work, previously existing community organizations and the center’s community advisory council for helping to make the center a reality. A video presentation featuring Pitt and community stakeholders outlined the center’s plans for a STEAM studio at the New Granada Center, the CEC’s future permanent home. When it’s finished, the CEC will double in size to 20,000 square feet. The studio will give community organizations in the neighborhood a space to hold activities and help show children career possibilities available in the STEAM fields. Holbrook said STEAM won’t just be an acronym for “science,” “technology,” “engineering,” “arts” and “mathematics.” The letters in the acronym can be swapped out to suit presenters’ needs and programming. For example, “E” could also represent “entertainment” or “entrepreneurship.” “I also want to highlight that the STEAM studio in the Hill is intended to be an enhancer to the overall community ecosystem,” Holbrook said. “We’re really excited to have such a strong focus around STEAM work as part of our Community Engagement Center because STEAM has the power to unlock human potential, both in youth and adults.” Donovan Harrell is a writer for the University Times.

UT_HD04,"Highmark renews offer to contribute to city, with caveat  Highmark renews offer to contribute to city, with caveat Friday, January 24, 2025 By SUSAN JONES Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey this week said that Highmark Health, parent company of Allegheny Health Network, has once again said it was willing to make a financial contribution to the city if the city’s three other large nonprofits — Pitt, UPMC and Carnegie Mellon University — also participate. The written commitment reiterates what Highmark has said in the past. “Highmark is prepared to meet to discuss financial contributions to the city of Pittsburgh, if the large nonprofits — including UPMC — are part of the meeting. Highmark is ready to make a financial commitment as soon as all of the large nonprofits participate in a financial contribution that is proportional, within the city, to its status as a purely public charity.” Gainey said in a news release and on the KDKA Morning Show that he is “calling on the leaders of the ‘Big 4’ to meet with me before the end of the month to finalize an agreement for predictable, proportional financial support for the core services provided by city government.” In response, a Pitt spokesman said, “The University of Pittsburgh is a significant, steadfast economic engine for the city and a dedicated community partner, anchor and collaborator. We are proud of the millions of dollars we contribute to the region’s economy every year and we value our longstanding partnerships throughout the city, including our longterm commitments in Greater Hazelwood, Homewood, the Hill District, and Oakland. We look forward to continuing to work together with the city to support and advance our region.” A UPMC spokesman told the PostGazette that, “The city and mayor are aware of UPMC’s ongoing support of various initiatives and have long known they can count on our full participation in programs that are fair and equitable and include the region’s other major nonprofits.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/highmarkrenewsoffer 1/2 "", ""Highmark renews offer to contribute to city, with caveat | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The city has long sought to get payments from the nonprofits to help boost its budget, either through reclassifying property as nonexempt from taxation or by creating a payment in lieu of taxes program. Neither has gained much traction. In March 2023, Gainey’s administration challenged the taxexempt status of 26 properties owned by nonprofits, including Pitt’s OC parking lot on Allequippa Street.

The week of activities — put together by the new artistic director for Pitt Jazz Studies Chad Taylor — culminates with a concert at 8 p.m. Nov. 2 at Bellefield Hall Auditorium. Tickets for the Saturday concert are $20 and $5 for any student with a valid ID, and are available at www.jazz.pitt.edu. The Jazz Seminar Concert will feature bassist and composer Reggie Workman and Pittsburgh's own percussion master Roger Humphries, alongside vocalist Jessica BoykinSettles, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, guitarist Jeff Parker, tenor saxophonist Brian Settles, pianist Sumi Tonooka, and alto saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins, along with Taylor on drums and new Department of Music chair Aaron Johnson on trombone. Taylor said it was his goal for the lineup at this year’s event to be multigenerational. “Having established musicians like Reggie Workman, who is 87, and Roger Humphries (who will be marking his 80th birthday) collaborate with younger musicians like Jeff Parker and Immanuel Wilkins will demonstrate how the language of jazz can evolve,” he said. “We can also honor the masters while they are still with us and also be excited about the future of this music.” For Taylor, one of the more exciting elements of the main Saturday concert is that these musicians have never shared a stage together and will do so following just one rehearsal. “I’m always intrigued how musicians who have never collaborated before can perform such amazing music live on stage,” he said. “These musicians I have selected all have their own sound, style and approach.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/jazzseminarwillfeature 1/3 "", ""Jazz Seminar will feature multigenerational lineup | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Another slate of national musicians will perform at a concert Oct. 29 in the Hill District to celebrate the Sam Rivers Archive acquired by the University Library System.

UT_HD06,"New music chair excited about broadening program’s offerings, community reach  New music chair excited about broadening program’s offerings, community reach Friday, September 6, 2024 By SHANNON O. WELLS Many talented musicians with aspirations in more traditional careers often find a way to play music “on the side” while their financial bread and better comes courtesy of their officebased employment. Aaron Johnson, who has taught music at Pitt since 2015, initially took this route, but ultimately chose to upend the triedandtrue dayjob concept. A Washington, D.C., native, Johnson earned degrees in electrical engineering and economics from Carnegie Mellon University, a master’s degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a doctorate in historical musicology at Columbia University. For about 20 years, Johnson worked in telecommunications research involving opticalfiber Aaron Johnson measurements, optical communications networks, DSL and video distribution networks. At the same time, he was an active jazz musician in the New York City area, playing trombone and bass trombone with the likes of Charles Tolliver, Jimmy Heath, Frank Lacy, Steve Turre, Wallace Roney and Aretha Franklin. He’s also recorded with contemporary music luminaries, including JayZ, among many others. “I just had parallel careers for many years,” he explained. “I was very active as a musician in high school, grade school and junior high. When I went off to college, I had to figure out how to keep playing while working on a degree in electrical engineering. It’s a choice a lot of https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/newmusicchairexcited 1/5 "", ""New music chair excited about broadening program’s offerings, community reach | University Times | University of Pittsburgh people have to learn to make. And it could be a tough one.” While an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon, Johnson joined the school’s jazz band, but said he quickly became “disgusted” with the ensemble’s “fast, high and loud” playing, as he shared in a 2013 profile by Massachusettsbased music writer Abby Wood. He found a more nurturing environment just down the road, in Pitt’s Jazz Band, which he’s credited as the source of his core jazz education. In the Dietrich School of Arts & Sciences, Johnson has served as associate professor in the music department, as part of the Cultural Studies and Film Studies affiliated faculty, as well as on the diversity, equity, and inclusion committee. With his recent appointment as chair of Pitt’s Department of Music, Johnson — the first African American in the role — said his primary goal is to keep the department on a dynamic, flexible path and respond to what students are looking for. “We’re constantly updating and revising our curriculum to keep it relevant to providing the students what they need,” he said. “We have a unique blend of students in the music department. We have a lot of people who are studying other things at Pitt, and they’re taking double majors or minors in music.” The department’s offerings include everything from traditional Western European/classical musiccentered education to what Johnson calls “music education that prepares them for the kind of music they want to play, (including) making beats or playing in rock bands or playing jazz or doing folk music. “We’re always trying to shake up our curriculum,” he said. A stabilizing force Deane Root, professor emeritus in the Department of Music since his 2018 retirement, said Johnson brings “a combination of experience and knowledge within and beyond music,” including his engineering background, performing as a professional trombonist and earning a Ph.D. at Columbia University, which Root called “one of the most challenging graduate musicology programs in the country.” Among the qualities Root said he admires about Johnson’s work as a teacher, mentor and chair include his “empathy and compassion for others.” “We invited him to interview as a finalist for the Pitt jazz faculty positions because of his impressive resume of teaching, research and life experience,” he said. “What became immediately clear during the oncampus interview was his ability to comprehend and relate to the challenges we faced in creating a new Ph.D. track: to maintain and strengthen bonds between the department, the rest of the University and the wider jazz community in Pittsburgh.” Root said he also values Johnson’s knack for nurturing students, “including firstgeneration college students and young people from throughout the region, as well as senior members of the public, many of them colleagues or family members of renowned jazz musicians.” Root, who joined Pitt’s Music Department in 1984 and served as department chair off and on between 2002 and 2018, said he believes Johnson will work to bring “stability” to the Jazz Studies program. He said this is something he tried himself, “but ultimately fell short of https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/newmusicchairexcited 2/5 "", ""New music chair excited about broadening program’s offerings, community reach | University Times | University of Pittsburgh doing.” A series of setbacks, including the retirement of the late Nathan Davis in 2013, the sudden death of his successor, Geri Allen, in 2017, the short tenure of her successor, Nicole Mitchell Gantt, and the more recent departure Associate Professor Michael Heller, left the program with what Root called “an aura of instability.” Johnson comes to the department chair’s position with a “combination of experiences and accomplishments that will serve him well,” Root noted. “And he has already been working to establish stable leadership for years to come beginning with the faculty search and appointment of Chad Taylor, new artistic director of the Jazz Studies program. (Johnson) has a strong commitment not only to the students and faculty within the undergraduate program as mentor for the jazz track … and as a fellow musician who understands the concerns of the parttime teaching faculty in performing arts.” Making yourself excellent While it’s commonly assumed that universitylevel music programs exist somewhere beyond the standard academic curriculum — and tend to nurture mostly parttime working musicians — Johnson finds that the brainstimulating study of music brings a unique knowledge base and perspective to most career paths — as well as other aspects of adult life. “There are lots of people who aspire to play (jazz) music, and what they do with the music in the long run? Do they necessarily play jazz their whole lives? Maybe not,” he said. “But you know, jazz talks to us about living. Jazz talks to us about coping. Jazz talks us about maximizing ourselves in the middle of an economy that’s all built on exchange and wages and ‘What can you do for me?’ Jazz is about making yourself good and excellent and speaking your mind.” Studying and playing jazz also provides solid training for those pursuing careers in more commercially oriented music genres, including soul/R&B and hip hop. “One thing in my own research I write about is how jazz has functioned as the training pedagogy for American music outside of classrooms,” Johnson said, noting the stable of session musicians behind the legendary Motown Records hits “were all aspiring jazz players. “And people with jazz abilities learn abilities to improvise, abilities to create parts out of (suggestions), to make music out of an idea. Those people’s skills have always been welcomed in more commercial forms of music, whether that’s a Springsteen fan, backing up Beyonce or being involved with Taylor Swift. “I’m not saying those are jazz musicians, but I’m saying you look under the hood, you’ll find a lot of jazz training in a lot of those,” he added. “So even to this day, musicians are coming out of Berkeley and Juilliard jazz programs, and they’re finding themselves very useful people in hiphop production and in music that the public doesn’t think of as jazz or see the connection.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/newmusicchairexcited 3/5 "", ""New music chair excited about broadening program’s offerings, community reach | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Pitt music in the air In addition to jazz, Pitt’s music program includes performance ensembles dedicated to classical/orchestra, bluegrass, African music and dance, chamber and choral music, among others. The fall 2024 semester will provide ample opportunities to hear Pitt musicians work their magic, including the Jazz Wednesdays on the Hill series, including a fall performance saluting local jazz legends, and the 54th Annual Pitt Jazz Seminar Concert, held Oct. 28Nov. 2. “And during Jazz Week on Oct. 29, we’ll be celebrating the Pitt Library’s acquisition of the archives of the great musician Sam Rivers,” Johnson noted. A concert highlighting Rivers’ music will take place at Ebenezer Baptist Church in the Hill District and feature what Johnson calls “some of Pittsburgh’s finest jazz musicians, along with worldfamous jazz musicians Steve Coleman, Craig Harris, Joe Daley and Doug Mathews. Deane Root said Johnson, as chair, has the opportunity to revive the department’s graduate program after a suspension in admissions during the COVID pandemic. “I hope he can help identify new sources of financial support for graduate students, as well as productive ways for faculty and students to engage with the wider community beyond academic courses and activities,” he noted, through the Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild, “with which we had developed a Memorandum of Understanding,” and the AfroAmerican Musical Institute in Homewood. He also praises Johnson’s efforts in organizing community and campus collaborations, including the Pittsburgh Jazz Orchestra’s concerts featuring new music by area composers. “I hope the department can continue to build its community collaborations,” Root said. While looking forward to a busy and vibrant fall semester, Johnson said he’s excited by the opportunity for Pitt’s music programs to continue expanding their reach, scope and influence. “I am convinced that the University of Pittsburgh can be a real force in the entire community,” he said, “and not just limited to local families and the students and staff that we serve.” Shannon O.

UT_HD07,"Professors’ biography sheds light on Black television news pioneer Mal Goode  Professors’ biography sheds light on Black television news pioneer Mal Goode Tuesday, June 4, 2024 By MARTY LEVINE Mal Goode is one pioneering Black Pittsburgher whose name may not be familiar to most, but a new biography written by two Pitt history professors — with the urging and cooperation of Goode’s family — aims to change all that. “Mal Goode Reporting: The Life and Work of a Black Broadcast Trailblazer” by Liann Tsoukas and Rob Ruck, published this month by the Pitt Press, is a biography of the first Black television news correspondent (for ABC News beginning in 1962) and his life of activism and journalism in Pittsburgh before that. As the authors say about his television career (but which certainly applies to his entire adult life): “Goode’s sense of mission was clear: to explain the racial currents of a nation in turmoil, inject an AfricanAmerican perspective into the conversation, (and) serve his profession …” The book traces Goode’s life beginning with his enslaved Virginia grandparents and his early days in the Hilltop section of Homestead starting in 1916, into which his family moved as part of the Great Migration of Black people from South to North. He eventually worked nights in a steel mill alongside the Monongahela River and Homestead’s poorer, crowded Ward while attending Pitt during the day. “No matter how remarkable his classmates were, race twisted their futures,” the authors note. Goode came to Pitt with the aim of emulating a Black Pitt law school graduate, then the Pittsburgh Courier’s most famous editor and advocate for AfricanAmerican rights, Robert L. Vann. But after graduating during the Depression, Goode found law school unreachable. The University, under Chancellor John Bowman during Goode’s years, was building the Cathedral of Learning. “But he clamped down on radical students and faculty,” the authors said of Bowman, “and despite his rhetorical commitment that the university advance https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/professorsbiography 1/5 "", ""Professors’ biography sheds light on Black television news pioneer Mal Goode | University Times | University of Pittsburgh humanity, Black students were marginalized at best and harassed at worst.” Goode had no Black professors and relatively few Black classmates, and had to fight against the arbitrary grading policy of at least one instructor who insisted a Black student earn no higher than a C in his class — lest the white students be upset. Goode did thrive among his fellow members of Alpha Phi Alpha, the Black fraternity that shared Goode’s two goals of high academic performance and advocacy for African Americans. “Those times were never easy,” Tsoukas and Ruck quoted Goode. “Make no mistake about it nor for one minute forget it. Yet I enjoyed my classes and stayed happy most of the time.” “His response to Pitt was mixed,” said Tsoukas, “but he recognized what an opportunity it was to go to Pitt. It was an association you carried your entire life.” Goode continued working at the mill after graduation, until he could marry and move to the Hill District. There he worked first as a juvenile probation officer, then as the boys work director at the segregated Centre Avenue YMCA and eventually as manager of Terrace Village and Bedford Dwellings, which were among the nation’s biggest integrated publichousing projects at the time. He faced and fought discrimination at every step along the way, eventually gaining a public voice as a writer with the Pittsburgh Courier, beginning in 1948, when this Blackowned and focused weekly was at the height of its circulation and influence as a publication, with offices and editions across the U.S. His work there included reporting on moves to desegregate the South, which paved the way for his coverage of the civil rights struggle throughout the U.S. later for ABC. While still in Pittsburgh he started a radio show on KQV, “The Courier Speaks,” as the only AfricanAmerican on Pittsburgh’s whiterun radio stations. His brother Bill already had a pharmacy on Wylie Avenue in the Hill, and his sister Mary, known professionally as Mary Dee, was broadcasting music both traditional and new on WHOD (later WAMO). Goode joined her there by 1950, where they “drove conversations about the city, race and deindustrialization’s early onslaught in the region,” the authors note. Goode’s news reports reached a new Black and white audience to whom his activist take was evident, as, after calling out police brutality in Pittsburgh, he was arrested several times and once hid in a car trunk just to be able to get around the city to do his reporting. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/professorsbiography 2/5 "", ""Professors’ biography sheds light on Black television news pioneer Mal Goode | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Goode’s talent was essentially hidden from ABC until he got aid from his friend, pathbreaking baseball player Jackie Robinson, who pushed ABC to hire him — with the help of Howard Cosell, as Tsoukas and Ruck tell it. Goode was never a sports reporter, but the book recounts how the Goodes’ Hill home hosted many Black ballplayers, from Hank Aaron and Willie Mays to Roberto Clemente. The book even details how Goode, a baseball fan, once did the Pirates’ playbyplay on the radio in place of an absent Bob Prince, and then tried to do it again — but white management wasn’t ready to hire a Black voice in Pittsburgh. Goode first got on television during his decade at ABC News when he broke into regular programming with an update on the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, reporting from United Nations headquarters in New York. In ensuing years he had to urge network heads to include more Black correspondents and to cover more of Black life than the civil rights movement. “He pushed to include the voices of the sharecroppers, steelworkers and middleclass professionals who were often invisible on national television and radio,” the authors write. “He chafed when the networks ignored Martin Luther King Jr., caricatured Malcolm X, or paid attention to Black neighborhoods only when burning.” Meanwhile, Goode gained special access to King and Malcolm as a trusted figure (after some struggle with the latter), and produced a documentary about Atlanta as an emerging desegregated Southern town while not shying from its many remaining issues. The book follows his entire television and extensive public speaking career and beyond. As the first Black network television correspondent, Goode was tremendously conscious of “how he was breaking through a barrier and how he was trying to report to both young professionals and the world the complete truth of life,” Tsoukas said. In the newsroom, he pushed to be part of the biggest stories, and sometimes when passed over he would simply assign himself to a story, showing up, doing the work and making his reporting unique and indispensable to the network. “He was in a Jackie Robinson situation” as the first Black person in his profession, Ruck said: “If he screws up,” well, it might mean a setback for all future AfricanAmericans on television news. “And he can’t be seen as arrogant; he needs to play it cool.” He ended up not only friends with many of the other journalists but was also seen as “a father figure, even though he hadn’t come up in the industry.” Collaborating with the Goode family – and each other Ruck, the author of several books on Pittsburgh sports, Black sports and their intersection, first met the Goode family in 1980 when speaking at a Heinz History Center panel on baseball’s Negro Leagues. Mal Goode’s son, Ronald, approached him afterward and said, as Ruck recalls: “If you want to know about the Negro Leagues, talk to my father.” Ruck interviewed Mal Goode for a documentary on the city’s Negro League teams and was subsequently approached to do the current book. He agreed as long as Tsoukas could be part of it, since she could bring her broader AfricanAmerican history and U.S. history backgrounds to the project. How do two people write a book? https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/professorsbiography 3/5 "", ""Professors’ biography sheds light on Black television news pioneer Mal Goode | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “It’s really hard,” Tsoukas said, but with “collaboration there’s a lot of fun,” Ruck added. “Working as a scholar is an isolating experience.” Working together, “it energizes you,” he said. “I think it made the book better and richer because we challenged each other in our assumptions,” continued Tsoukas. “I had strong opinions on Mal’s life, its impact, and we had to battle them out. We had discussions with each other that no historian could have alone.” And Tsoukas was able to bring out the role of Goode’s wife, Mary Lavelle, “in a way I don’t think I could,” Ruck said. Of course, the pair emphasized, they had the participation of the family, and Goode himself left a lot of writing, from an unfinished memoir to other personal writing full of his own opinions, which are reflected in the book. In the end, the authors hope readers understand that Goode was a seminal 20th century figure — as Ruck put it, “part of the glue that builds the cohesion in the Black community to make it possible for the civil rights movement to be successful.” Goode’s time and his work, said Tsoukas, represents “a major shift in AfricanAmerican identity and visibility, and he fights those battles daily, about who is presenting the news and who is watching the news.” Also instructive for the book were the more than 1,000 public addresses Goode gave. “His talks … can be Baptist church (style), thumping the podium, but they are filled with data and analysis,” Ruck said. “He was always prepared to deliver a fully cooked analysis of anything with data and names,” Tsoukas said. Despite Goode’s accomplishments, “We don’t know why he was lost, but he never got the acclaim of what he achieved,” she added. “We know that Black folks in the media all know who he was.” “Mal had a lot of gravitas,” Ruck said, noting that network news anchors of the day “just had a great respect and affection for him. But he never gets propelled center stage.” “When you see him deliver the news, he is so good,” Tsoukas observed. “He didn’t need notes. He’s got his presence … He personalizes these stories in a way that he is talking to you.” Marty Levine is a staff writer for the University Times. Reach him at martyl@pitt.edu or 4127584859.

UT_HD08,"History professor’s website focuses on Black migration to Pittsburgh  History professor’s website focuses on Black migration to Pittsburgh Tuesday, June 4, 2024 By MARTY LEVINE A new website from a Pitt–Greensburg history professor presents a trove of original voices from the beginning of Pittsburgh’s experience of the Great Migration — the early 20th century movement of Black Americans from the rural South to industrial Northern cities, which doubled Pittsburgh’s Black population from 1915 to 1930. For the website, migrantvoices.pitt.edu, Adam Lee Cilli has brought together many primary sources — contemporaneous letters from migrants, oral histories recorded later in their lives and those of their neighbors, plus research studies and newspaper articles from the 1910s to ‘30s about migrant conditions and experiences. Cilli’s own focus is on the influence of social movements on American democracy, but he also has a particular interest in Pittsburgh, since his father was a steelworker and Cilli grew up here. He has always been interested in racial justice issues and “in how class dynamics played out,” he says. He recently received a $6,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a book examining efforts in Black communities to develop crime reduction programs and reform urban criminal justice systems during the Great Migration. Adam Cilli His research has led him to work with these oral histories for the past decade, for instance, and to help get some of them digitized and transcribed so that they are searchable. It also led him to include materials on the website about the relationship https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/historyprofessors 1/3 "", ""History professor’s website focuses on Black migration to Pittsburgh | University Times | University of Pittsburgh between Southern migrants and Pittsburgh’s Black civic reformers, as well as the relationships among older and newer Black migrants to the city, which were sometimes based on class and sometimes ignored large political differences. “There were unique kinds of relationships that were made during this period,” Cilli says, including a lot of racial solidarity but also intraracial conflict. The reformers, in their civic groups such as the local NAACP and Urban League, “left behind a lot of rich records. But the migrants left a challenge”: Where were their voices directly available? “Oral history has proven to be a powerful way to give a voice to people who previously did not have a voice,” Cilli says. Listening to the hours of voices from this past, when Pittsburgh was still very segregated and Black residents’ prospects for jobs and housing were limited, Cilli says that he “expected the participants to talk about how terrible racism was in the early 20th century, not just racial prejudice but ethnic prejudice” against the poor whites with whom Blacks shared the Hill District, for instance. But that wasn’t the case. “Human memory is a flawed thing,” he says. “I think that when decades pass some of the anger passes too.” In fact there is even a certain nostalgia for the past, among the speakers. The website brings together three different oral history collections in one spot: Interviews from the 1970s of 53 Black residents of Pittsburgh from the earliest parts of the 20th century (some done by a Pitt Ph.D. student and some housed in the Pitt archive). Many of these interviews were excerpted in a pair of books, but the tapes themselves were neither widely known nor heard for decades. Cilli’s Migrant Voices website also brings together a 1922 article that was published in many Black weeklies urging Black migrants to choose Pittsburgh for its job opportunities. Written by Pittsburgh’s Urban League head, John T. Clark, the article received many letters from hopeful migrants asking for specifics, such as pay and working conditions, and offering details of their own current lives. About 20 of them, brief but poignant, are reproduced. “One of the interesting features about the letters,” Cilli says, is that “in particular, they speak to the agency of the migrants. It’s very easy to classify migrants as if they were blown about by outside forces beyond their control — Jim Crow, boll weevils, job agents visiting” to lure them northward. “What those letters do is they demonstrate … migrants are using strategies, calculated decisions” about when and where they are going to end up, and why. Cilli hopes that the website will be used “by a broad swath of people, not just historians — anyone who is interested in the history of Black Pittsburgh in the early 20th century, someone who is interested in the Great Migration.” He kept the website concept simple, he said, “so that the content can speak for itself. My idea is that the kinds of content that I had to hunt for, particularly in lots of different depositories, will be right there.” Although he plans to add more oral history transcriptions so that they are all eventually searchable, these materials will remain surrounded by just enough introductory information to put them in context: “I wanted the history to speak for itself. I wanted the (material) to shine the most and I thought they would shine the most by getting out of the way.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/historyprofessors 2/3 "", ""History professor’s website focuses on Black migration to Pittsburgh | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Marty Levine is a staff writer for the University Times.

The school also has begun a pilot program to recruit local people for onthejob training when their resumes may not yet include the requisite education or experience. The effort is an expansion of the professional development series begun two years ago with the support of Dean Kathleen Blee, says Michele Montag, executive director for staff personnel and senior assistant dean at the Dietrich School. It aims to promote career growth for staff members, with such offerings as training on University systems and on diversity and inclusion; sessions on how to build resumes and prepare for interviews; and instruction for supervisors on how to support staff in their career growth. The four halfday diversity and inclusion sessions, says Montag, were developed by Maureen Lazar, director of workforce effectiveness in the Dietrich School. “It’s become an incredible way for people who wouldn’t Michele Montag usually interact with each other … to have deep and meaningful conversations with each other” and “think about how to stand up for themselves, how to stand up for others.” Twenty Pitt staff members who attended these sessions are in a new yearlong pilot program called Connected, which pairs them up with the aim of mentoring each other. They will learn to tell their stories, says Montag — where they want their career to go, what https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/dietrichschooltaking 1/3 "", ""Dietrich School taking staff career growth seriously | University Times | University of Pittsburgh they are passionate about — and spend the ensuing months helping each other toward their goals. The program will also connect people across disparate parts of the Dietrich School, Montag says. The entire group is meeting quarterly to discuss their progress toward personal and professional goals. The school also has formed an engagement committee, since the school is “really trying to make this a place where people want to come to work,” says Montag — where “they know their colleagues and have the kind of personal engagements that make them want to stay here. How do we make the whole of being here better?” Anyone on staff can take part in the engagement committee, which has had several initial public meetings to brainstorm ideas, and started a LinkedIn group, Dietrich School Staff Community, which will post their next meeting dates, events and other updates. Recent committee events include a cookie baking competition and a family evening at Pitt’s Allegheny Observatory. The new staff fellows program was developed as a way to recruit people to work here who don’t yet have the background to earn an entrylevel job. It places fellows in a ninemonth paid position, during which they rotate through several different jobs. Not only do they gain valuable experience in data entry or as an administrative assistant, Montag explains, but they are matched with a Pitt mentor who helps them work on their resume and connect to others across the University. Potential staff fellows are being sought through Pitt’s community engagement centers in Homewood and the Hill District and elsewhere. “The goal is to bring someone in, give them training at the University over a limited amount of time” and prepare them to be a new University employee — in the Dietrich school or elsewhere at Pitt, Montag says. Thus far, one fellow has gained a fulltime Pitt job from the experience and another is in the initial training and experience phase. “It’s been really wonderful to have all of this as a priority of the dean,” she adds.

UT_HD10,"Kathy Humphrey has a commitment ‘to improve the lives of others’  Kathy Humphrey has a commitment ‘to improve the lives of others’ Thursday, January 23, 2020 More than 200 people showed up on Jan. 21 to honor Senior Vice Chancellor for Engagement Kathy Humphrey (center). (Aimee Obidzinski/University of Pittsburgh) By DONOVAN HARRELL When people bring up Kathy Humphrey in a conversation, the conversation often swings to her enormous extended family of more than 90 nieces and nephews from her 10 siblings. But the more than 200 faculty, staff and students who filled the William Pitt Union nearly to capacity at the Equipoise MLK Unity Luncheon on Jan. 21 showed that her family extends deep into the Pitt community as well. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/kathyhumphreyhas 1/6 "", ""Kathy Humphrey has a commitment ‘to improve the lives of others’ | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner, keynote speaker for the luncheon, said he had an “interesting task” to introduce a woman who’s impacted so many lives, accomplished so much and is so beloved by the Pitt community. “How do you introduce a woman who needs no introduction?” he said as the luncheon attendees laughed. Bonner gushed over Humphrey, who he said has been a dear mentor and friend to him and countless others during her time at Pitt. “Kathy is a familiar presence to our students and comforting reminder of the things that make us all feel the same: valued, appreciated, understood, and most importantly, loved,” Bonner said. “Kathy, not the tower of the Cathedral that we all love and cherish, but Kathy, a towering woman, full of life who has changed lives in ways only she can with the perfect amount of kindness, motivation and compassion that resonates with so many of our students as they find their way along … through these sometimes difficult journeys through college.” Humphrey said she was humbled to be honored at the annual luncheon and to be the recipient of this year’s Creating a Just Community Award from Equipoise. “I keep thinking about this, and I think it’s not right that you get honored for doing something you love,” she said, chuckling. “It’s just not right. I feel like I’ve already been so rewarded by just doing the work.” Family values Humphrey’s immediate family includes her two twin sons, David and Daniel, and her husband of nearly 35 years, Lyle. But it was her parents, Harold and Cora Wilson, who instilled the importance of education and inclusion in her at an early age. They had experienced Jim Crow firsthand and migrated from Louisiana to Michigan hoping to give their 11 children more educational opportunities than they had. Their experiences, and other firsthandhand accounts of Jim Crowera laws, helped solidify Humphrey’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. “It helps me to understand my commitment to this issue of diversity and inclusion because it has a personal effect on me,” Humphrey said. “Knowing what it is to survive being a woman of color, to try to progress as a woman of color — if I can make that easier for somebody else, it’s my responsibility to do that work.” Harold Wilson was a bricklayer who often left architectural blueprints sprawled across the family dinner table, Humphrey said, where he taught their children math and grammar. Thanks to him always inviting people of all backgrounds to their home, he taught Humphrey that people, no matter their background, are to be respected. “The greatest crime you could commit in front of my father was to make fun of, or devalue another person,” Humphrey said. “He just didn’t tolerate that. And my dad was a very calm guy, he sent the message at a very young age that everyone had value and that has just been a part of my life.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/kathyhumphreyhas 2/6 "", ""Kathy Humphrey has a commitment ‘to improve the lives of others’ | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Cora Wilson earned her associate’s degree the same year Humphrey graduated from high school, she said. However, she wasn’t able to fulfill her ultimate goal of earning a bachelor’s degree. She inspired Humphrey to value her education as she went on to earn her master’s at the University of MissouriKansas City and a Ph.D. in educational leadership at Saint Louis University. Humphrey said that a week before her mother passed away in 2000, she asked Humphrey how long it would take to finish her Ph.D. “At the time, I had no idea, but I said ‘Mama, it takes a long time,’ ” she said of the hospital visit. “She died two days later. And I think that if I said, ‘Oh, I’m going to finish in two months,’ or even a year, she’d have figured out how to see that happen, because it was so important to her that our children had an opportunity to get a better education.” This was especially true since Cora lived in the early 1900s, just a few generations away from slavery, Humphrey added. A trio led by Nicole Mitchell, head of Jazz Studies at Pitt, entertained during the Equipoise luncheon. (Aimee Obidzinski/University of Pittsburgh) Accomplishments in diversity and inclusion Her family also extends deep into the Pitt community. Formerly the dean of students, Humphrey carried on the values her parents set as she would occasionally invite students of all backgrounds over to her house for dinner to try and expand her understanding of diversity and inclusion. Her time as dean of students held several moments that she’s been proud of, including developing the CrossCultural Leadership Development Center and moving black and white Greek organizations from separate locations to one location. Another one of the highlights, https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/kathyhumphreyhas 3/6 "", ""Kathy Humphrey has a commitment ‘to improve the lives of others’ | University Times | University of Pittsburgh she said was her and her staff helping make the campus more inclusive for members of the LGBTQIA+ community by implementing genderneutral housing and bathrooms and changing Pitt’s diversity statement to include them. As senior vice chancellor for engagement, Humphrey said she’s been especially proud of the expansion of diversity programs offered at Pitt, including a certificate program and a variety of workshops. Chancellor Patrick Gallagher was very supportive of the idea of an Office of Diversity and Inclusion, leading to the birth of the office in 2015. Since then, the office has grown to focus on sexual misconduct and disabilities. In addition, faculty and staff have been able to join Pitt Communities, groups with shared beliefs and backgrounds. “The chancellor, initially, he said to me when he got here, ‘Kathy, I hear people talking a lot about diversity and inclusion here. But there’s really no real culture of diversity and inclusion.’ I couldn’t help but to agree. And so that is really how we came up with creating the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.” Humphrey also has enjoyed the success and growth of the Community Engagement Centers in Homewood and the Hill District, which are part of her office. She has heavily supported the centers since the very beginning. Since the Homewood center opened in 2018, the centers have further expanded Pitt’s outreach to people from diverse backgrounds, she added. “Inclusion and diversity really happen at the apex of relationships,” Humphrey said. “We are creating relationships not only internally, but externally. Those relationships will help us do a better job of creating a culture of inclusion.” Humphrey said that her work has been extremely rewarding. However, she’s faced some bumps along the road. “It’s always difficult when people exhibit behavior that is contrary to a culture of diversity and inclusion,” Humphrey said. “One of the challenges is this issue is not an issue where you can force, it is a heart condition. And rarely do you change the heart with force.” As dean of students, she would sometimes get calls from parents who said they wanted to separate their children from students in underrepresented groups. “You can drown in the frustration or you can decide you’re going to swim,” Humphrey said. “But you have to make some decisions. If you’re going to do this work, you’ve got to know that there’s some negatives that come along with it. And you’ve got to be able to roll with the negatives so that you can get to your ultimate prize, and your ultimate is making it better.” She’s also had to address incidents of racial violence in the Pitt community and in the broader Pittsburgh community, including the Tree of Life mass shooting and the Antwon Rose Jr. shooting and subsequent protests. “I think every inappropriate situation that happens, it is an opportunity to learn how to make our community stronger. And I think that’s what we have to be in the constant business of, is that if we fail that we learn from those failures, and we move the institution forward.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/kathyhumphreyhas 4/6 "", ""Kathy Humphrey has a commitment ‘to improve the lives of others’ | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Humphrey also has faced personal some personal difficulties in recent years. Michael Rosfeld, the former East Pittsburgh police officer who shot and killed Rose, arrested her son Daniel and others while they were outside the Garage Door Saloon in June 2018. He was a member of the Pitt Police at the time. Rosfeld was fired after an internal investigation. The incident sparked a series of lawsuits. Rosfeld most recently filed a lawsuit on Jan. 16 against Humphrey, the University and Pitt Police alleging that his rights were violated when he was fired after the Garage Door Saloon incident. Humphrey said that because the lawsuits are still pending, she is unable to comment on them. In 2018, Humphrey also was among three finalists who withdrew their application for a chancellor search at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, after faculty publicly challenged the qualifications of all the candidates. Humphrey said her focus on her life’s work — to improve the lives of others — helped and continues to help her through these personal issues. “I have tried to live a life that has a positive impact on others’ lives,” Humphrey said. “Nobody has a life without challenges. We all do. It’s how we manage those challenges.” Looking toward the future In spite of Humphrey’s work to make Pitt more diverse and inclusive, she said that the University still has a long way to go before it becomes a truly inclusive community. To continue improving these efforts, Humphrey is carefully considering who she’ll bring on as the new vice chancellor for Diversity and Inclusion. Pam Connelly, who most recently held the position, stepped down earlier this year. Humphrey said she’s looking for candidates who understand how to help increase diversity and inclusion and who are capable of comforting the community in the event of incidents. She has faith that Pitt can one day become a truly inclusive environment if there are enough people working hard to make it a reality. “We’ve got to really make some decisions about what will make us one of the most inclusive environments in the country. And by that, I mean, we have to collectively decide where are we going so that we can measure it (and) so that we cannot only measure it, but we can help everyone understand where we’re going with this strategy of diversity and inclusion.” Pitt inspires her to do more, which is why she remains at the institution “It’s because I have been able to work with people who were willing to make a difference in the lives of other people.” Donovan Harrell is a writer for the University Times.

(Aimee Obidzinksi/University of Pittsburgh) By DONOVAN HARRELL The Carnegie Foundation has recognized the University’s community service initiatives with the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification. A select group of Universities is chosen every five years to receive this honor, according to Pittwire, and on Jan. 31, Pitt joined the 358 other institutions that received the designation. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pitthonoredcarnegie 1/3 "", ""Pitt honored with Carnegie Community Engagement Classification | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The Carnegie Community Engagement Classification, which has been around for 14 years, is housed at Brown University. It’s given to institutions after a period of selfevaluation and an assessment by a national review committee from Swearer Center for Public Engagement at Brown University, according to Pittwire. Pitt has partnered with several community organizations as part of its community outreach initiatives. These include AIDS Free Pittsburgh Partnership, PlaceBased Justice Network, Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities and Gwen’s Girls/Black Girls Equity Alliance. Lina Dostilio, associate vice chancellor for community engagement, said Pitt has partnered with some community organizations for more than 30 years. “Pitt’s application for the classification truly reflects the breadth of communityengaged work happening across the campus, much which has been ongoing for decades,” Dostilio said in an emailed statement. Pitt’s Community Engagement Centers in Homewood and the Hill District, in particular, are outreach programs neighborhood residents have praised. “They’re collaboratively developed with members of the neighborhoods in which they are located, and because of that, have been wildly successful in bringing community and University members into deep partnership,” Dostilio said. “Through this work and new initiatives that we will launch under the next strategic plan, we will continue to strengthen and deepen our community commitments: I’m excited about the future of engagement at Pitt.” Kathy Humphrey, senior vice chancellor for Engagement, and Provost Ann Cudd released a joint statement on Jan. 31 praising the designation and thanking the Pitt community for its hard work on engagement initiatives. “For many years, Pitt has sought to obtain this honor,” the statement read. “This designation speaks to our universitywide commitment to strengthening communities, transforming lives and to truly making a difference.” Paul Supowitz, vice chancellor for Community and Governmental Relations, added that the Pitt community’s combined dedication to community engagement has helped improve community partnerships. “In the Office of Community and Governmental Relations, it’s been a core purpose of ours to make sure that community voice is heard internally,” Supowitz said. “This type of open communication has helped to strengthen University and community partnerships overall.

The headlines just in the past couple months illustrate the political headwinds higher education faces: Florida rule would limit talk of ‘social issues’ at public universities.

DIVERSITY FORUM https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittleansdiversity 1/5 "", ""Pitt leans in on diversity as other universities deal with outside pressure to make cuts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Pitt’s annual Diversity Forum has taken place each summer since 2016, but this year it is being moved to January to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Clyde Pickett, vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion, said they heard from faculty and students that it was difficult for them to participate in July. The event — “Amplifying Our Voices Through Active Listening and Constructive Dialogue” — will take place Jan. 23 and 24, 2024, as part of MLK Social Justice Week. The theme coincides with Pitt’s Year of Dialogue and Discourse. Questions? Email diversity@pitt.edu “I think from the top down in the University, the message is that we consider (diversity, equity and inclusion) to be important,” said Adam Leibovich, dean of the Dietrich School of Arts & Sciences. “And I'm grateful we live in a state where the legislators are not making it impossible for us to do that.” Chancellor Joan Gabel has repeatedly voiced her support for diversity and equity on campus. “I'm committed to building a campus community where a sense of belonging is strong, accessibility is valued, and equity and diversity are actively promoted,” she told the University Times. “We are leaning into this expectation through the development of the next chapter of the Plan for Pitt so that we can work together to become the community we aspire to be.” “In looking at our university, there's a clear commitment to the work to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,” said Clyde Pickett, vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion. The diversity landscape became even more complicated this summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court restricted the use of racebased admission practices at universities. Gabel said at the September Board of Trustees meeting: “We’ve been working as a leadership team on the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding admissions practices in order to ensure that we continue to fulfill our commitment to be a representative and equitable community while being fully compliant with new law.” While the ruling said colleges cannot directly use race when considering an application, it said they could consider “an applicant’s discussion of how race affected the applicant’s life” if it was tied to the “quality of character or unique ability.” An article in The Hill in September noted that the U.S. Education Department is urging colleges to ramp up their diversity efforts in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. The department issued a report outlining ways higher education institutions can promote more diversity in their admission practices, including boosting scholarships and minority recruiting. Marc Harding, vice provost for enrollment, told a Senate committee earlier this semester that a group with representatives from all of Pitt’s campuses is looking into how to maintain the mission outlined in a provost’s memo after the ruling, which said: “The University of Pittsburgh’s mission is to improve lives through education and knowledge. We believe that https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittleansdiversity 2/5 "", ""Pitt leans in on diversity as other universities deal with outside pressure to make cuts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh all of our students can and should benefit from this mission. And that diversity in all its forms enhances our individual and shared success and improves the educational experience.” Pickett pointed out that the “team from the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid have long been proactive in establishing relationships with different communities of color in diverse communities, and I think that will bode well for us in the future in terms of the ways in which we've had those lines of communication open.” Growing diversity leadership Over the past several years, almost all of Pitt’s schools have added or elevated the role of chief diversity officers. Just last summer the Dietrich School of Arts & Sciences named its first associate dean for equity, faculty recruitment and community engagement, Natasha Tokowicz, and Pitt Business named its first associate dean for inclusion, engagement and international affairs, Paul Harper. Under previous Dean Kathleen Blee, the Dietrich School had a special adviser to the dean on diversity issues, but new Dean Adam Leibovich thought “elevating that to an associate dean level would allow us to do more and actually make systemwide changes and try to improve the situation a lot more than then we could do with just the special adviser.” Harper’s newly created role under Dean Gene Anderson is part of the Pitt Business 2030 strategic plan. “I think that there have been individuals all around the University that have championed this work in different schools and units,” Pickett said. “And I think for me as senior diversity officer for the institution, having those colleagues who are moving the work around and have them have official titles that support this work, I think is very helpful and fruitful in addition to my role.” Pickett, who also is second vice president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, said one of the things his colleagues discuss is “institutional commitment and sustained commitment for this work.” He said it’s important to look at the ways in which peer institutions in the AAU and ACC have supported diversity work. “We know … that our (Pitt) community continues to prioritize and amplify that commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion,” he said, noting they’ve heard that loud and clear from students, faculty and staff. Pickett said his work at Pitt and with the national association “has underscored that when we're looking to create a community, it's important for our colleagues to see a commitment … to diversity, equity and inclusion, and to see that commitment in action. I think that having an office like ours, having colleagues around the University, says that we are committed to this, and I think that it will bode well for us in the future as we're working to continue to recruit students and for us to continue to attract and retain our colleagues.” Faculty, staff and students who don't get support and affirmation for their identity and for their scholarship are going to look for places to find that, Pickett said. “I think my role in that is to bring awareness to the importance of the ways in which we champion diversity, https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittleansdiversity 3/5 "", ""Pitt leans in on diversity as other universities deal with outside pressure to make cuts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh equity, inclusion, accessibility (at Pitt) and the individuals who do this work.” In the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020 and the increased focus on diversity work, Pickett said, “I think those who not only made commitments, but those who executed those will be long remembered. I think that it will certainly bode well for them in terms of students who will come to those organizations, in terms of faculty who will want to come and stay, and in creating an environment where staff can thrive.” A more diverse community In addition to adding more diversity and inclusion professionals throughout the University, Pitt has — through different initiatives — increased diversity among students, employees and vendors. Chancellor Gabel, in welcoming the incoming firstyear class this fall, said it was “one of the most diverse groups of students (that’s) ever entered (Pitt) in every way we measure that.” That includes a large number of students who are the first in their family to attend college. In the past 10 years, the percentage of Black students at Pitt has increased from 6.5 percent of all students to 8.5 percent. The number of Hispanic or Latino students has almost doubled, now making up 6.7 percent this year, and Asian students make up 21.4 percent of enrollment this year. Faculty also have seen increases in diverse populations: Black representation has increased from 2.9 to 4 percent of faculty; Hispanic/Latino from 2.7 to 3.8 percent; and Asian from 16.5 to 18.2 percent. Staff have seen just slight increases in these populations. Two hiring initiatives in recent years have not only focused on diverse faculty, but also diversity in scholarship. A multiyear, Latinx clusterhiring initiative started in 2019 was aimed at attracting more faculty with academic expertise in topics concerning the broad, diverse Latinx community. The Race and Social Determinants of Equity, Health and Wellbeing Cluster Hire and Retention Initiative from the Office of the Provost and Pitt Health Sciences was started in 2021, to significantly increase the number of faculty who are hired, promoted and retained who specialize in race, equity, health and wellbeing and to improve Pitt’s international, national and local profile and expertise in those area. It welcomed 25 faculty in its first cohort last year and has spawned the Race & … initiative, which has sponsored a lecture series, annual conferences, and summer retreats and other events. These initiatives fall under John Wallace, whose position as vice provost for faculty diversity & development was created in 2020. Previously those jobs were combined with vice provost of faculty affairs. Lorie JohnsonOsho joined the office as director of faculty diversity and development in 2020 to promote a comprehensive set of programs to support the career and professional development of all Pitt faculty. Facilities Management also has expanded its diversity initiatives, including an operating engineer apprenticeship program in collaboration with Hill District community groups. At job sites, the University has made a commitment to bring in more minorityand womenowned businesses, which were awarded 39 percent of the recently completed Chilled Water Plant construction project. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittleansdiversity 4/5 "", ""Pitt leans in on diversity as other universities deal with outside pressure to make cuts | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Pickett said, “One of the things that we want to do is continue to make sure that this is an inclusive community for all, and so continuing to respond and be proactive in creating initiatives and listening to concerns when there are possible disruptions to making an inclusive community.

Jake Wheatley, DHill District. Tim Stevens, chairman and CEO of the Black Political Empowerment Project, moderated the discussion. (Donovan Harrell/University Times) By DONOVAN HARRELL https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/blackpoliticalleaders 1/3 "", ""Black political leaders call for action beyond voting | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Black elected officials gathered in the Homewood Community Engagement Center on Feb. 11 to discuss the importance of political participation, as part of Black History Month and its national theme, “African Americans and the Vote.” The event, hosted by the CEC and the University Library System, featured a panel discussion between black elected officials and voting advocates. This upcoming electoral season has high stakes, said Crystal McCormick, director of diversity and inclusion initiatives for the library system, and “the AfricanAmerican vote is crucial in many ways.” “These are troubling times,” McCormick said. “It’s our hope that the panel discussion will garner and foster our knowledge and our energy for those who may not be registered to vote and those who are registered who could not vote in the last election to vote in the upcoming primaries or the 2020 presidential election.” The panel included Nickole Nesby, mayor of the city of Duquesne; Pittsburgh City Councilmen R. Daniel Lavelle and Ricky Burgess; and State Reps. Ed Gainey, DAllegheny, and Jake Wheatley, DHill District. Tim Stevens, chairman and CEO of the Black Political Empowerment Project, moderated the discussion as the panelists spoke on a myriad of topics including why they got involved in politics, the 2020 presidential election, their ongoing, frustrating political battles for equity and barriers black people face when attempting to vote. “Can you imagine what would happen if every black person in America voted in each and every election,” Stevens said in his opening statement. “We haven’t utilized the power that we have.” Each panelist noted issues with getting their fellow politicians to help back projects that would help address economic inequalities in the black community, from criminal justice reforms to making housing more affordable. Nesby said she has also faced constant harassment since taking office. Even though the black vote is crucial in the upcoming elections, it’s important for black people to remember that the “the weight of the world” doesn’t fall on them and only them. The political system alone cannot solve every issue, Wheatley said. To make societal progress, communities, the private and public sectors and other stakeholders need to join together on issues, Wheatley said. “That means you got to have some real engagement and difficult conversations with each other,” Wheatley said. “When we started getting our folks who are not engaged, we engage, and we have to do it in a way that meets them where they are.” He later added that while it’s important for stakeholders to meet with their political representatives to discuss issues, the overall goal of changing unjust systems shouldn’t be lost. “We have to meet with these people because in order to have the conversation engaged, you have to communicate. But I’m like most like black people around here that’s frustrated and tired of just meeting with these people,” Wheatley said. “We want to get to a point where we don’t have to meet with them. The system should be correcting itself.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/blackpoliticalleaders 2/3 "", ""Black political leaders call for action beyond voting | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Gainey later said that it’s also crucial to improve the black community’s economic power. One way to do this is to hold business owners more accountable for promoting diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices. Nesby added that black people can rise above their various challenges by seeking out positions of power and partnering with outside communities. “At the end of the day, start going back to your community, your block, your people, and start putting your people in those positions of power,” Nesby said. “Not looking for somebody else to give you the answer you already know — quit giving them power over you. If you look at our system and how it’s set up, it is set up for us to fail.

UT_HD17,"In April interview, Gallagher talked about his nineyear tenure | University Times | University of Pittsburgh VOLUME 55 ISSUE 24, SPECIAL EDITION: JULY 17, 2023 In April interview, Gallagher talked about his nineyear tenure Monday, July 17, 2023 Editor's note: This story originally appeared in the April 29 University Times. By SUSAN JONES The end is in sight for Patrick Gallagher’s time as Pitt’s 18th chancellor, but that doesn’t mean he’s not busy. Gallagher will officially step down in July, when Joan Gabel becomes the University’s first female chancellor. “A large part of my focus now is really, what can I do to make sure Joan Gabel is the next great chancellor at Pitt and to make her transition as effective as possible and help her be the best chancellor that she can be,” Gallagher said in an interview this week. At Senate Council on April 20, he said Gabel is “just a very approachable, sincere leader, and I think she’s doing this for all the right reasons, and that’s really what this is about — somebody dedicated to what we’re doing here who’s going to be a partner and lead us. … You now need to train my successor as you trained me. I know she’ll be looking forward to it, much as I did.” Gallagher sat down recently with the University Times to reflect on his time at Pitt and what’s next for him and the University. On Pitt’s biggest accomplishments during his tenure “It’s always hard to summarize nine years in a couple of sentences,” Gallagher said. “I think what I’m most proud of is, at a time when higher education has had quite a few headwinds — socially, culturally, politically, a pandemic, financially — the University has managed to https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/aprilinterviewgallagher 1/6 "", ""In April interview, Gallagher talked about his nineyear tenure | University Times | University of Pittsburgh not just survive, but I would say thrive.” He cited the momentum in academic programs and research, as well as athletics and fundraising. “It’s just really gratifying to see that we’ve sort of overcome these obstacles,” he said, “but I think the tough times are with us. (Universities are) always mixed up in the turbulence of the day and there’s a lot of turbulence. But we face all of those headwinds from a position of strength.” The chancellor also is proud that Pitt has chosen in the past several years to look outward instead of inward. This includes the University’s community engagement work, its economic impact through translational and entrepreneurial work and its social impact by working on the important issues of the day. “I just think that the story of impact for the University is really important, and that’s where the value proposition of higher education lives,” he said. On his toughest challenges “I would say the most frustrating challenge has been the degree to which political viewpoint has affected people’s perception of higher education,” Gallagher said. “We’ve lost what has been since World War II a strong, bipartisan national consensus on the importance of colleges and universities, on the value of a college degree, on the importance of university research, on the critical role universities play in communities. That suddenly is now being questioned very broadly, very consistently, and, to an increasing extent, in a way that it draws sharp distinctions based on party. Then it’s becoming a political issue.” He said this hasn’t been as prevalent in Pennsylvania, but “we’re not immune to it.” “What universities do, the value of a college degree, the importance of that research, has never been more important. The world is more knowledgecentric than it ever has been, and this is a strange time to have lost our confidence as a country in terms of the value of (higher education).” On the biggest surprises moving from government to academia “Well, I didn’t have to worry about athletics or football teams or anything else,” he said of his time as director of the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology and as acting deputy secretary of Commerce before coming to Pitt. On a more serious note, he said that although people think government is very complex and has to deal with a variety of constituencies, “I think university leadership is much harder than government leadership, to be honest.” Just like in government, he’s had to deal with “very many different groups that don’t always agree on everything. … If I’m honest with myself, I wasn’t expecting that to be as true as it was.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/aprilinterviewgallagher 2/6 "", ""In April interview, Gallagher talked about his nineyear tenure | University Times | University of Pittsburgh On the challenges Pitt faces in the next few years “I’m going to sound sort of facetious about this, but the biggest challenge you face for the next three years is that nobody has a crystal ball that will tell you what the next three years will be like,” he said. Some of the issues ahead include: The amount of legislation being proposed nationwide to restrict higher ed is “quite alarming.” Students coming to universities now have a gap in their learning experience because of the pandemic that still isn’t understood. A wholesale change in the enrollment landscape is altering where students are applying to go to college and what their expectations are. Universities must figure out how to support students after graduation as the world of work goes through massive changes. Gallagher said the key is to remain flexible. “It almost sounds like the COVID messaging — be very flexible and adaptable as we navigate what’s likely to continue to be a dynamic and uncertain period.” On his goals during his last few months “I certainly don’t have a chancellor bucket list,” he said. “There are things that will happen under my watch, and I’m certainly working on those. I have to put in an interim provost and … I have to support the budget process, which should be done before I step down.” Much of his focus now is on helping with the transition to a new chancellor. “The trick with transitions is they’re driven by the person coming in,” Gallagher said. “It’s not me telling Joan what she should do. It’s Joan asking me for information that can be helpful to her. It starts with a lot of listening, being available, collecting information, explaining why we were doing what we were doing and what the thought process was. “Joan is a very seasoned leader and has spent most of her adult life leading universities in some capacity. But she’s never been to Pitt so a lot of this is talking about … the things that are unique to us. And just to help her get her sea legs.” On Joan Gabel’s attributes as chancellorelect “She’s somebody whose whole life has been dedicated to the mission of higher education,” he said. “If anyone has walked the talk, it’s Joan Gabel, even more than me. I came in from outside of the academy.” The other thing she brings is, “she’s not Pat Gallagher,” the chancellor said, “and she comes in with her own viewpoints and new ideas and new energy. And there’s a wonderful kind of creative disruption that happens when somebody new comes in and gets to know the team https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/aprilinterviewgallagher 3/6 "", ""In April interview, Gallagher talked about his nineyear tenure | University Times | University of Pittsburgh and starts to ask a lot of the key questions. There’s an opening of possibilities that are part of that new start. And I think that’s really magical. And that’s why I think it’s actually good for institutions to change at the top from time to time.” On joining the faculty ranks Gallagher said he does plan to join the faculty union when he starts teaching in the physics department in fall 2024, but he’s not sure if there’s a waiting period before he can do that. “My intention is I would be a member of the union because the faculty voted to be represented by one. And I think that’s part of the deal — when the faculty have agreed to be represented that way, you should be part of that process.” He’ll also be moving to the North Side shortly after commencement to give crews time to clean the chancellor’s residence in Shadyside before Gabel arrives in midJuly. Gallagher’s tenure Chancellor Patrick Gallagher announced in April 2022 that he will step down this summer.

UT_HD18,"Creativation brings community into ‘Crepescule’ composition  Creativation brings community into ‘Crepescule’ composition Monday, March 2, 2020 By SUSAN JONES “Crepescule,” a composition modeled after the music and innovative style of jazz pianist Thelonius Monk, is at the center of Creativation — one of the signature events for Pitt’s Year of Creativity. ‘CREPESCULE’ and CREATIVATION When and where: 57 p.m. March 20, Pitt Sports Dome Directions: Main entrance is located off of Robinson Street Extension, behind the Cost Sports Center, and rear entrance is accessible from Avalon Street in the Hill District. Parking: A shuttle will be available outside of the Soldiers & Sailors Parking Garage entrance on Bigelow Boulevard, departing garage every 30 minutes, starting at 2:45 p.m. Composer Douglas R. Ewart will bring his massive organized improvisation, “Crepescule,” to the Pitt Sports Dome on March 20 and everyone — especially the neighboring Hill District community — is invited to attend and interact with art, music, dance, puppetry, martial arts and more. Ewart, who was in Pittsburgh for the second time last week and will return March 14, said the name Crepescule — which means “twilight” — comes from Monk’s piece, “Crepescule with Nellie.” Ewart’s original composition was “primarily focused on music, or it was https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/creativationbrings 1/3 "", ""Creativation brings community into ‘Crepescule’ composition | University Times | University of Pittsburgh supposed to be. I did it in a park, and as I got started writing, I thought, ‘Wow, you know I could expand this.’ It was going to be done in a park that has a lake in the center. And I decided, well, I could have musicians playing from boats, I could get sculling team, which I did. “I added puppetry, dance, martial arts. Almost any practice or discipline, I started pulling in, and as the years went by, more and more things were brought in,” he said. “The idea is, there are no boundaries to what we do as creative artists.” He’s been going around Pittsburgh to recruit professional participants, both individuals and ensembles, from many different fields. Some of the people he’s talked to include a Capoeira group — a AfroBrazilian martial art that combines dance, acrobatics, and music — and a puppetry organization. Students from the Manchester Bidwell Corporation of Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild will display horticulture and photos of famous local artists and musicians. He’s also met with community members about the program and been teaching children how to make simple instruments, such as shakers and rain sticks, and how to play them, so they can participate too. Nicole Mitchell Gantt, head of Pitt Jazz Studies and campus coordinator of Creativation, said this will be the first time that the Pitt Sports Dome, which was opened in 2017 and sits at the top of the Hill District, has been opened to the neighboring community. Gantt said they’ll make sure the gates are open from all sides to allow people to come in that day. Anyone can register to attend here. “I feel that part of my role here as the director of Jazz Studies is to help to support and encourage community collaboration,” she said. “And this is a wonderful opportunity for people to learn about each other and also for the University to be generous and to provide something fun for everyone.” The core group of active performers at the event will “represent Pittsburgh in all of its diversity,” Gantt said. Creativation is a multigenerational celebration, both honoring community elders and teaching young people about music, community and culture. There’s also an environmental aspect of the event. Reclaimed materials will be used to create the simple instruments. And, of course, there will be food trucks. Ewart said the celebration will start outside and then the participating artists will move in a procession into the dome and around the perimeter. This will be followed by a musical invocation and meditation, and a salute to four or five community elders. The performers will then go to prechosen areas of the dome to demonstrate their art. Visitors can move around to hear different music and see various performers. After about 30 minutes, there will be an interactive portion, during which the musicians and dancers might perform near people who are creating a mural or making instruments. The active participants and visitors will then gather in a circle and different groups will be invited into the center of the ring to perform. When the circle reforms, those gathered will recite some mantras, such as “One small wind can raise much dust,” which Ewart says signifies that the individual is a very powerful entity that can influence a community. Underlying all the performances is Ewart’s composition “Crepescule,” including some additional music created just for this event. “Each time, there’s some new aspect to it, but there’s a structure that is there already.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/creativationbrings 2/3 "", ""Creativation brings community into ‘Crepescule’ composition | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Ewart said he has created celebrations with “Crepescule” at more than 20 locations, including Chicago, Paris and Philadelphia.

UT_HD19,"More than 500 have stepped up for pandemic community service  More than 500 have stepped up for pandemic community service Wednesday, April 29, 2020 By DONOVAN HARRELL The Office of Community and Governmental Relations is working hard to provide service opportunities despite the COVID19 pandemic. And the Pitt community is responding. At the April 21 Senate Community Relations Committee meeting, Jamie Ducar, director of community engagement, said that more than 500 Pitt students, staff and faculty have participated in the Pitt Pandemic Service Initiative since it officially launched March 31. The initiative is made up of three parts: donation and facility requests; expanded staff, faculty and student service opportunities; and partnerships to address remaining issues after the pandemic. The idea began when Community and Governmental Relations representatives met with Senior Vice Chancellor Kathy Humphrey to draw up new engagement opportunities once it became clear that Pitt was transitioning to a remote environment because of the pandemic. Associate Vice Chancellor for Community Engagement Lina Dostilio said this initiative came during a time when Humphrey and David DeJong, vice chancellor of Human Resources, were looking into ways to strengthen Pitt’s community engagement commitments. As part of the plan, staff can request up to eight hours per week from their work schedule to volunteer. The initiative offers a slew of volunteer opportunities for the Pitt community, including providing IT support and reaching out with care and connection calls. The University is partnering with multiple community organizations, including Meals on Wheels, the Community Empowerment Association, the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center and United Way. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/more500havestepped 1/3 "", ""More than 500 have stepped up for pandemic community service | University Times | University of Pittsburgh One highlight is a partnership with the Beyond the Laptops Campaign to help refurbish thousands of laptops for families in Pittsburgh Public Schools. “We know that many families and individuals need computer support,” Dostilio said. “Whether that's setting up a laptop, getting online, utilizing different applications, browsers, email software, we know that people need IT support.” Volunteers also can join an IT Help Desk, Dostilio said, which is available for individuals, families and community organizations. So far, around 200 volunteers are participating. Dostilio said her department reached out to ask community organizations about the best ways for Pitt to contribute. For instance, Pitt is partnering with the Neighborhood Resilience Project, which helps provide services to neighborhoods lacking medical support, to supply food and factual information about COVID19. “I think in times of crisis, our better natures reveal themselves, and people immediately want to help,” Dostilio said. “Sometimes we can overload the systems that are working directly with people who are most affected by the crisis. We knew that it was important for us, with our partners at PittServes, to reach out to partner organizations with whom we've had longstanding relationships.” Dostilio said these partnerships will continue beyond the pandemic. “This is not an on/off light switch,” Dostilio said. “People who have experienced the greatest disruption to their lives, the loss of basic support services, the need for technological assistance, for food assistance — that's going to continue even after people feel like we've reopened our economy or have returned to inperson work environments.” Additionally, the University has a committee focused on streamlining and facilitating donations. So far, the committee has coordinated donations of personal protective equipment for volunteers offering inperson services to communities. Inperson volunteers have limited or no contact with recipients and each uses protective equipment, Dostilio said. The Community Engagement Centers in Homewood and the Hill District have hosted virtual town halls on Facebook for Pittsburgh residents looking for more information about the pandemic and will continue to do so every month. “There's really some powerful work that's being done in a convening and connecting space for people,” Dostilio said at the April 21 Senate Community and Governmental Relations Committee. She said the Pitt community overall has done a great job in supporting its surrounding neighborhoods during the pandemic. “We really are a University of the community,” Dostilio said. “I would say that the University of Pittsburgh has really found its core DNA of being a communityengaged institution. And we're uniquely suited to do this kind of partnered work in this time of crisis, and I am inspired and proud of the University of Pittsburgh.” For a full list of activities, visit community.pitt.edu. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/more500havestepped 2/3 "", ""More than 500 have stepped up for pandemic community service | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Donovan Harrell is a writer for the University Times.

UT_HD20,"With new director on board, work begins on Hill District CEC facility  With new director on board, work begins on Hill District CEC facility Thursday, July 6, 2023 The New Granada Theater space for the Hill District Community Engagement Center will provide more space for a STEAM studio, which the CEC has been holding at its current space for several months for kids in grades 38. (Johnathan Wright | University of Pittsburgh) By SHANNON O. WELLS With a recent groundbreaking ceremony, a newly hired director in place and summer programs going full steam from its current facility, the new Hill District Community Engagement Center is morphing from a promising proposal to momentumfueled reality. Ground was broken on May 25 to kick off renovations for the Historic New Granada Theater and adjacent spaces at 2007 Centre Ave. The project that will allow the CEC to move from its current residence in the Blakey Program Center on Wiley Avenue. Adding to the forward https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/newdirectorboardwork 1/5 "", ""With new director on board, work begins on Hill District CEC facility | University Times | University of Pittsburgh motion is Kelly Protho, who started as the CEC’s director in midMarch after serving as a senior applied learning and development specialist with the Allegheny Department of Health and Human Services. Calling the renovation project “on schedule,” Keith Caldwell, executive director of placebased initiatives in the Office of Engagement and Community Affairs, finds a lot to be enthused about regarding Pitt’s expanding Hill District presence. “We are excited to move into the New Granada in fall of 2024,” he said of the building constructed as a Knights of Pythias temple in 1927. “The highlight of the (groundbreaking) event was community leaders, funders, University leaders and residents standing shouldertoshoulder celebrating what has been decades of work done by the Hill Community Development Keith Caldwell Corporation and Marimba Milliones (New Granada’s president and CEO) to reopen this catalytic space to the community.” Doubling the Hill District CEC’s current size to 20,000 square feet, the Granada space also will include a STEAM studio to provide programming and opportunities based on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. Pitt will serve as an anchor tenant, providing classrooms, offices, additional spaces and programming for the Center for African American Poetry and Poetics, the School of Social Work, jazz studies and computer literacy classes. The community engagement centers are the most visible aspect of Pitt’s Neighborhood Commitments initiative, a minimum 15year plan for investment, infrastructure, programming and dedicated staff in neighborhoods like Homewood, the Hill District and Hazelwood, the location for a CEC now in the planning stages. Established in 2019, the Hill District CEC serves as a catalyst for collaboration and opportunity between Pitt and its surrounding neighborhoods. From the Blakey Program Center, the CEC offers various programs, educational opportunities and events for Hill District residents. Residents in the driver’s seat Calling the theater restoration a “very complex endeavor,” Caldwell admitted it’s taken considerable time and focus to balance the physical work involved while “developing a comprehensive reuse plan that honors its history while making space for the future of the Hill District,” he said. “The Hill (Community Development Corp.) has woven together a committed set of partners that have made the project possible. … “We are excited about expanding the programs and partnerships that we currently offer, within the revitalized space,” he added. “Having larger space allows for more programs like Reimagining Reentry to continue to use our space for each starting cohort and dedicated spaces for our STEAM Studio, the Jazz program’s Jazz Incubator, and the Center for African American Poetry and Poetics to have their studio, community engagement and performance spaces.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/newdirectorboardwork 2/5 "", ""With new director on board, work begins on Hill District CEC facility | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The Hill CEC’s current staff of four will continue their roles when the New Granada space is complete. “Though small, the team is mighty,” Caldwell said, noting that “all our CECs have additional communityengaged staff and faculty from the various academic departments who work out of the CEC as their primary location.” Kelly Protho, who in her role at the Allegheny health department conducted trainings on advancing racial equity and practical applications of traumaenforced care, said her experience should serve her well in taking the Hill District CEC to a dynamic new level. Kelly Protho “My focus is to not only build strong relationships and rapport within the community, faculty and staff, but also growing our programming for both youth and adults,” she said. “There are new digital programs, platforms and skill sets that are changing every day, and I want our programs to offer an outlet where our residents are not being left behind but are in the driver’s seat.” Protho, who earned a political science degree at Hampton University in Virginia, said as someone “fascinated with history,” the CEC being an anchor tenant in the New Granada is particularly exciting. “The fact that the building itself was designed by a Black architect (Louis Bellinger) — an HBCU graduate (of Howard University) — the countless number of legendary artists who performed in the space, and it being a centralized hub in the community gives me hope for what this space can offer to the community once it’s completed.” STEAM of the summer While the renovation work moves ahead, the CEC’s STEAM summer camps are up and running for six weeks. The Hill District CEC has partnered with Citizen Science Lab, Pitt’s Bioengineering department, Toyz Electronics and Pitt IT to facilitate camps for youth in grades 38. “Our STEAM studio is a direct outgrowth of the #NewGranadaSTEAM planning process that was led by the Hill CEC in 2016,” Caldwell explained. “Upon deciding to be the anchor tenant within the New Granada, we were eager to be a partner in bringing about some of the goals identified within that planning process. We then expanded the conversation with support from the PNC Foundation to bring together more than 30 communitybased organizations and academic departments to envision what Pitt could do collaboratively in the area of STEAM.” One of the most tangible outcomes, he noted, was planning a STEAM Studio and an associated set of programs that focus on the five STEAM elements as well as digital equity. “The last element, digital equity, is a core aspect of the programming we do at the Hill CEC and is generously supported by Neighborhood Allies. We focus our work on aligning University resources and expertise with community goals and wisdom.” The CEC recently purchased two 3D printers for the studio and plans to create classes and programming based on the acquisitions. “We look forward to having a space that will expand our STEAM educational opportunities for children in the community,” Caldwell said, “as well as expand opportunities for our adults and seniors.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/newdirectorboardwork 3/5 "", ""With new director on board, work begins on Hill District CEC facility | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The CEC will bring its adult computerliteracy programming back this fall, followed by hosting EmployHER Pittsburgh in October for a career fair. The full slate of activities at the Blakey Center, he added, includes programs “across the lifespan,” such as introduction to trades for people reentering society after incarceration through Reimagine Reentry, workshops and classes for adults (Communiversity) and seniors (Crossing the Digital Divide), adult computer programming, services for job seekers, events that engage Blackowned businesses with Pitt contracts, and more, Caldwell said. Hazelwood CEC As Hill District programs hum along, Caldwell continues to focus on the twoyear planning project to establish a Hazelwood CEC along the Monongahela River. Supported by Heinz Endowments, the process involves intentionally planning with both University and community partners, including the Center for Life, ways to leverage the life sciences developments from Pitt’s BioForge project “in a way that strengthens the community,” Caldwell said last fall. Areas of focus include lifesciences infrastructure to support K12 STEM education, workforce development opportunities for Hazelwood residents and inclusive community development. “We are excited to colocate with the Center of Life in their new headquarters slated for Hazelwood Green,” Caldwell said. “Along with several community organizations, the Pitt CEC in Greater Hazelwood will include dedicated spaces for the Pitt Office of Child Development and the School of Nursing’s Nurse Practitioner Clinic.” Caldwell’s office also is engaged in a twoyear project with community leaders to identify unique opportunities to leverage Life Sciences Pittsburgh to advance community. “That planning will be the foundation of our Greater Hazelwood CEC. We will have participation from disciplines across the University, and a wide network of community organization collaborators that will bring to life a universe of programming.” Caldwell, who took on his CECbased role in spring 2022 after 14 years on the School of Social Work faculty, praised the role of Pitt’s Neighborhood Commitments and the University’s devotion to engaging closely with the community it serves and nurtures. “The commitments — focused on the Oakland, Homewood, Hill District, and Greater Hazelwood neighborhoods of Pittsburgh — provide longterm commitments of staffing, infrastructure and coordination to facilitate mutually beneficial collaborations between Pitt and the local community,” he said, adding that CECs anchoring Homewood, the Hill District and soon Hazelwood provide “vibrant, welcoming facilities.” “However, our work in these communities extends well beyond the four walls of the CEC. Pitt’s neighborhood commitments extend to the work we do in community centers, school buildings, churches, doctor’s offices, libraries and every manner of site you can think of.” Shannon O.

UT_HD21,"University has let down Pitt’s black community, chancellor says  University has let down Pitt’s black community, chancellor says Friday, June 12, 2020 By DONOVAN HARRELL Chancellor Patrick Gallagher and Provost Ann Cudd are doing some soulsearching as recent protests throughout the country have forced institutions to evaluate the extent of systemic oppression against AfricanAmericans. “Like many of you, this is possibly one of the biggest moments that I’ve lived through in the sense that such a fundamental injustice, something that’s touching people so dramatically and that’s sort of permeated our society — at least our country — from its very founding is coming up in this powerful way, catalyzing not just national outrage and protest and demand for change but now globally,” Gallagher said of the various Black Lives Matter and social justice protests underway. The death of George Floyd, who died last month after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, was the spark for a new wave of protests against police brutality and systemic injustices against AfricanAmericans. Gallagher said at the June 11 Senate Council meeting that this recent wave of protests is shining a light on injustice and is changing the way institutions address systemic oppression. Cudd also said these protests are very wellmerited and highly effective. “And I’ll be candid, I don’t know if I fully appreciated the enormity of it when we were watching another case of unbelievable police brutality, but I think it’s clear to all of us now that this is big,” Gallagher said. Gallagher added that after several meetings with various members of Pitt’s black community, it’s clear that Pitt has to improve its culture dramatically. “One of the most painful things is the degree to which we let them down as well that their experience didn’t live up to the ideals that we uphold as a University,” Gallagher said. “And whether it was in explicit ways or implicit ways, it simply wasn’t acceptable. And I think https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/universityhasletdown 1/4 "", ""University has let down Pitt’s black community, chancellor says | University Times | University of Pittsburgh that’s something that while it was painful, it was also brutally honest.” He and Cudd said the protests and these conversations have reaffirmed their resolve for making Pitt a more inclusive place for black faculty, staff and students. “You don’t make change by only focusing on the parts of the story you already know or that you want to believe in,” Gallagher said. “You do it by putting up a mirror in front of yourself and, in our case, our own organization to see how we can do better.” Cudd said that she would “double down” on her commitment to diversity, inclusion, equity and justice, particularly around AfricanAmerican communities. Some of her priorities are to hire and promote more black faculty and increase financial aid for black students. Further, Gallagher said that additional plans are underway to try and improve institutional accountability for making these changes. He said it was crucial to pause Pitt’s fiveyear strategic planning process to reevaluate how the University can better support equity and justice. “In some schools, staff are being added to support black student organizations that we have neglected to provide them appropriate staffing, and that includes the Excel program in engineering,” Gallagher said. Additionally, Gallagher said he’s adding more black students to the Public Safety Advisory Committee, chaired by Pitt Law Professor David Harris. They will work with the Pitt Police department to reexamine how the department works and interacts with members of Pitt’s black community. Pitt Police officers also will receive additional diversity training that focuses on the needs of the community, Gallagher said. He said that there aren’t any plans to adjust the funding for the department amid nationwide movements to “defund” police departments. Another change Pitt is considering is renaming Scaife Hall. Recently black students in the School of Medicine have expressed concerns that the name is tied to the eugenics movement. The building is named for Alan Scaife, whose daughter Cordelia Scaife May has been linked to antiimmigration policies. “Our starting point, interestingly enough, is going to be to learn more about this ourselves and to take a retreat and to look specifically at the issues of systemic racism, and then turn to what we as an institution have to do to dismantle those systems, to essentially demolish a system of systemic racism that we might have here at the University,” Gallagher said. He said he has also approached United Way to see if they’d work with Pitt’s student organizations to create an impact fund to address systemic issues. Cudd and Gallagher have said they will be looking for ways to make sure Pitt is using more of its resources to help Pittsburgh’s black communities, including the Hill District and Homewood, where Pitt has opened Community Engagement Centers. “The Hill District is just a few miles from the Cathedral of Learning,” Gallagher said. “We have not shared the wealth of education and opportunity that we can provide. We haven’t been that beacon of inquiry and learning and education for our nearest neighbors that we should be.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/universityhasletdown 2/4 "", ""University has let down Pitt’s black community, chancellor says | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Gallagher said it’s especially painful that these difficult conversations are happening during a time of social distancing because of the COVID19 pandemic. This makes it difficult to emotionally support black faculty, staff and students who may be retraumatized by George Floyd’s death, he said. Some black students told Gallagher Pitt’s response to this situation feels different when compared to the response to the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. “There was kind of this palpable coming together,” Gallagher said. “We were standing in the Cathedral lawn. We were wearing ‘Pitt is Stronger Than Hate’ tshirts — that solidarity, it just felt supported.” But one way Pitt is helping support its black community is by “making spaces” for their voices to be heard, Cudd said. And she and Gallagher said they would make sure that they spend plenty of time listening to their concerns. Gallagher said authenticity is also key to making lasting changes to the University “We’re not looking for performative empathy here, performative solidarity,” Gallagher said. “These are colleagues, these are friends, these are people we work with. And one of the failings, and I think in some cases, is white discomfort with talking about race. In the middle of the trauma, we either failed to recognize it or we just didn’t reach out.” Gallagher vowed that Pitt can and will take concrete action on equity, justice, diversity and inclusion. “We’re moving past the time of statements and words,” Gallagher said. “This is really a time of what are we going to do about it?” Donovan Harrell is a writer for the University Times.

UT_HD22,"Diversity Forum is larger than ever with the move to a virtual format  Diversity Forum is larger than ever with the move to a virtual format Friday, July 24, 2020 By DONOVAN HARRELL It was unclear how Pitt’s annual diversity retreat would be conducted this year amid the COVID19 pandemic. At the beginning of the planning stages, Ron Idoko, the diversity and multicultural program manager for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, thought the office would try a more “scaledback” approach in light of the pandemic. But Kathy Humphrey, senior vice chancellor for Engagement, had other aspirations. “We started this out by saying, “OK, we can’t do an inperson retreat,’ ” Humphrey said. “We could have accepted that as defeat and walked away, but we couldn’t. We couldn’t afford to accept that as defeat.” Instead, Idoko said, Humphrey wanted the 2020 Diversity Forum to go the opposite direction and expand. Now, it has grown larger and longer than ever with its transition to a completely virtual format. The Advancing Social Justice: A Call to Action forum, which will take place from July 28 to 30, has 8,000 people registered as of July 24. At least 2,500 are nonPitt affiliates and 1,000 are educators from outside of Pitt, Idoko said. And there are more than 55 different workshops planned. Registration is still open. These workshops will discuss a wide range of topics from antiracist strategies and art activism to tech equity and water insecurity. Scholar and activist Ibram Kendi, author of “How to Be an Antiracist,” will be the keynote speaker. Activist and academic Angela Davis is also scheduled to speak on July 28 in a discussion with Humphrey and Provost Ann Cudd. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityforumlarger 1/4 "", ""Diversity Forum is larger than ever with the move to a virtual format | University Times | University of Pittsburgh \""I'm delighted to be one of the speakers of Pitt's threeday virtual forum on antiracism and social justice education,\"" Kendi said in an emailed statement. \""I hope this forum can move us, move our ideas, move our policies forward towards justice and equity.\"" In previous years, the retreat took place in a day, and eight was the highest number of workshops held at the diversity retreats, Idoko said. The retreat last year included roughly 350 people. “The goal was to really think about, how do we engage the broader community?” Idoko said of this year’s diversity forum. “In the past, the retreat was limited to staff, faculty — and so, (we’re) expanding the opportunity for registration to anyone.” This upcoming school term is the Year of Engagement at Pitt, and Humphrey saw this forum as an opportunity to engage people worldwide. For example, there are people registered from Canada and places in Africa, Humphrey said. She added that she doesn't \""ever see this forum going back to inperson\"" because of how far it has reached. But with a forum of this size, it can be daunting to figure out which events to attend, especially if a participant is new to topics surrounding equity and inclusion. Humphrey said it helps if participants focus on topics that they know the least about and review the sessions before they participate. “They have to come to the forum with needs. And they have to try to get those needs met,” Humphrey said. “I want to encourage people to do some selfexamination before you get there.” Since people can’t attend every session, each workshop will be recorded and uploaded to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion website within a week of the forum, Idoko said, which is another advantage of the digital format. Humphrey added that she believes the forum will still provide a similar level of intimacy compared to when it was in person. She also said that in the future, she In the future, Humphrey believes the forum will remain virtual “because of the impact that we are able to make in this medium.” She said she hopes people leave this forum with new skillsets and a drive to use them to promote change. “For me, the forum is about tool creation,” Humphrey said. “Because I don’t want people just to have conversations. I want people to walk away from the forum and say, ‘these are things I concretely can do to make the places where I stand, better.’ ” Featured sessions 6 p.m. July 28: “A Call to Activism: Witnessing Globally, Responding Locally,” with Clyde Wilson Pickett, vice chancellor for diversity and inclusion; Leigh Patel, professor in the School of Education; Jasiri X, rapper, activist and founder of antiviolence group 1Hood; Darren Whitfield, assistant professor of Social Work https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityforumlarger 2/4 "", ""Diversity Forum is larger than ever with the move to a virtual format | University Times | University of Pittsburgh 9 a.m. July 29: “America’s Persistent Pandemic — Racism: How to Foster Antiracist Practices and Create a Culture of Inclusion, Equity and Justice,” with Ibram Kendi, professor, Department of History, Boston University, and one of the nation's leading scholars on race and racism.

UT_HD25,"Longtime Environmental Health leader Jay Frerotte retires  Longtime Environmental Health leader Jay Frerotte retires Thursday, March 2, 2023 By ANTHONY CONROY Jay Frerotte, who retired as Pitt’s assistant vice chancellor of environment health & safety in January, was one of the key people developing the University’s response to the COVID19 pandemic in 2020. But the planning for this worldwide emergency began much earlier in Frerotte’s 21year career at Pitt. In 2007, Jerome Cochran, the late executive vice chancellor, turned to Frerotte and asked that he begin building the infrastructure for a Universitywide pandemic plan. Years later, that effort is one of the defining accomplishments of Frerotte’s career. Molly StittFischer, who succeeded Frerotte as environmental health and safety director praised his “foresight” in the planning, which helped lay “the foundation for our response to a rapidly changing situation and allowed the University to have an effective management team in place before a pandemic was officially declared.” Even more critical, she said, is that his “public health expertise and extensive knowledge of effectively delivering training, accurate information, and support for all the stakeholders required to maintain critical operations was, and remains, key to preserving the wellness of our entire community.” Frerotte, 62, began his career in Baltimore as a sanitarian at the city’s health department. From there, he moved to the Johns Hopkins Hospital to be an environmental sanitarian and later added the roles of safety manager for the hospital and Johns Hopkins University. “When I came here (in 2002), I had natural reservations because I had been a manager, but I wasn’t the EH&S director at Hopkins. So I wondered if I was cut out for it,” he said. “But I was from the Pittsburgh area, and I knew what to expect from the people. That proved true, because the people in Pittsburgh are authentic and care about honesty and hard work and doing things the right way. It was nice to come home.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/longtimeenvironmental 1/5 "", ""Longtime Environmental Health leader Jay Frerotte retires | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Since his arrival, Frerotte — once described by the Pitt Chronicle as having “a perfect combination of John Wayne confidence and Mr. Rogers sensitivity” — brought credibility and leadership to the role, taking over a department that he was told was “rigid” and “uncooperative.” Beyond battling those perceptions, Frerotte’s first major challenge at Pitt was overseeing EH&S’s role in the construction of the BST3 building. “When I first got here, (BST3) was just a concept,” he said. “We also received the money for the Pitt Regional Biocontainment Lab. I, along with other Pitt people, went down to Washington to the National Institutes of Health to start planning for that facility. To see that from concept to groundbreaking to completion, I learned a tremendous amount from that.” Another challenge has been keeping up with his colleagues on the research side. “Pitt was already a toptier research institution when I got here, and we’ve just really fortified our position in research nationally,” he said. “We worked really hard to the get the EH&S Department be a part of that. Safety’s really an active part of the research enterprise here. We lay eyes on all of the protocols and visit all the labs. But that didn’t just happen. It was a yearslong process to get where safety is integrated in every safety application.” ‘Like the world had changed’ After COVID19 hit, no other issue would test Frerotte’s skills like the new emerging coronavirus. “I had people come up to me and say, ‘You mean we have a plan for something like this?!’” said Ted Fritz, vice chancellor of public safety and emergency management and Frerotte’s most recent supervisor. “Of course, this was only an emergency plan and that plan had to be further developed, but it sure was nice knowing we had a starting point when COVID19 hit America.” Frerotte, Fritz and other members of the Emergency Command Committee worked to keep up with the pace of changing guidance and the necessity of information. “(Fritz) was giving a daily update to the University leadership every night,” Frerotte said. “That was a big part of our day, where we’d say, ‘OK, what happened today?’ We’d write it all down, we’d update all these statistics, and then it would be released. … It was a growing network where people were feeding in data, such as how many students were calling Student Health Services who were sick.” The University recorded its first confirmed case on March 21, 2020, after a student reported symptoms. It didn’t take long for the second, even though by then most students had left campus after the University effectively shut down inperson activities. “At the time, there were 371 cases in Pennsylvania, with most in Philadelphia,” Frerotte said. After Pitt’s first case was confirmed, “we had several calls about how we were going to control and investigate it. It was a Saturday. Then, at 6:30 that night, I got a call from (Pitt Police Deputy Chief) Holly Lamb that there was another case, a student taken from (a residence hall) to the UPMC Presbyterian hospital emergency department with symptoms.” The second student had been traveling abroad before returning to campus, Frerotte said. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/longtimeenvironmental 2/5 "", ""Longtime Environmental Health leader Jay Frerotte retires | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “So we went from having our first case to, by that night, having someone in the emergency department,” he said. “That kind of told us, ‘It’s here. It’s here in Pittsburgh. It’s on campus.’ That elevated things. It was like the world had changed.” Another challenge was figuring out how to reopen the University to inperson classes and activities. When the students, faculty and staff returned to Oakland after of remote learning and working from home, Pitt resumed oncampus activities — but with a robust roster of new rules and restrictions in place. “There was a lot of anxiety,” Frerotte said of the return to campus. “We’d get questions about social distancing and mask wearing. We were just trying to keep ahead of it. So, as the return began, I gave every department or school a liaison out of the EH&S office — like a goto person. The liaison from this office would walk through their space as they reopened it and advise on everything with the social distancing and with signage.” John Williams, former director of Pitt’s COVID19 Medical Response Office, said Frerotte brought “inexhaustible energy, unflappable calmness, and a persistent drive to get the job done. He made contributions to every aspect of our efforts.” Frerotte was lauded for helping open mass vaccination clinics — such as the ones held at the Petersen Events Center not long after the vaccinations became available. In addition to organizing the clinics, Frerotte helped get masks and personal protection equipment distributed, and sourced freezers to hold the vaccines. “Jay is the behindthescenes hero who was the connector to university resources that were needed to make those clinics possible,” said Melissa McGivney, a pharmacy professor who led Pitt’s vaccination efforts. “There was no job too big or too small for Jay to conquer — his goal was always to create the best experience for people coming to Pitt to be vaccinated.” In 2021, the University was asked if it could handle offcampus mass vaccination clinics for two of Pittsburgh’s most vulnerable and underserved communities. “Jay immediately stepped in to lead obtaining all the equipment needed to run a fullscale mass vaccination clinic at the Homewood YMCA and Hill District former Shop ‘n Save,” said Dr. McGivney. “He worked to design the layout of the vaccination process based on the (Petersen Events Center), secured tables, chairs, pipe and draping for the areas to make the flow as smooth as possible. He secured Pitt Movers and water and snacks from Pitt Eats to be brought to each site and connected with University Police for security and connections with Pittsburgh Police for support of the events.” Added Williams: “He went above and beyond to make sure everyone had what they needed and did so with grace and kindness.” Helping to organize clinics like the one in the Hill District was one of the most rewarding experiences Frerotte had at Pitt, he said. “It was gratifying because it’s an underserved community in a lot of aspects,” he said. “The Pitt administration deserves a lot of credit for that — for, a) consenting to do that, and then b) providing the resources to make that happen. It’s Pitt giving back to the community in a huge way.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/longtimeenvironmental 3/5 "", ""Longtime Environmental Health leader Jay Frerotte retires | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Building a credible program After arriving in Oakland, Frerotte was tasked with reinvigorating a department and hiring the most qualified people with expertise in workplace, chemical, biohazard, and animal safety. His establishment of new audit processes and knack at good hiring helped to boost Pitt’s safety credentials. “I have always been impressed with Mr. Frerotte’s professionalism; knowledge about laboratory biosafety; and his ability to oversee and coordinate efforts to keep faculty, staff and trainees safe across the University,” said Lee Harrison, professor in the Infectious Disease Division and director of the Center for Genomic Epidemiology at the School of Medicine. “Most importantly, Mr. Frerotte has always demonstrated extraordinary passion in his commitment to the health and wellbeing of the University community that goes well beyond his job responsibilities.\"" He, and those he hired, brought a customerservice approach to how the department handled campus concerns — striking a friendlier, more approachable tone. “His leadership in the realm of safety is second to none,” said Fritz, who said he will miss talking about sports with Frerotte and “being able to bounce off of him some tricky and complicated issues.” “He was able to achieve a drastically lower rate of workplace injuries at Pitt; he was key in developing one of the largest, safest and finest regional biocontainment laboratories at any university in the country. Pitt is a highly respected research institution in part because of its exemplary safety record. Jay’s style is not dictatorial, but educational, and his superb staff has adopted it.” Frerotte, who retires as the assistant vice chancellor of EH&S, plans to spend more time playing golf and traveling with his wife of 38 years, Susan, also a Pitt retiree. The two will be heading south for the remainder of winter and visiting with their son and daughter, who are building their own families in Savannah, Ga. Each has a son, and a third grandson is on the way, Frerotte said. Despite the traveling, Frerotte has no immediate plans to leave Pittsburgh – or Pitt – anytime soon. “I just reupped my Pitt season tickets for football,” he joked. When not watching Pitt sporting events and Pittsburgh Penguins games, he said, “I’m going to do the things I like to do. I always promised myself that I’d retire when I was eligible, and I’ve been lucky enough to do that.” Anthony Conroy is a communication specialist with the Office of Public Safety & Emergency Management. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/longtimeenvironmental 4/5 "", ""Longtime Environmental Health leader Jay Frerotte retires | University Times | University of Pittsburgh University of Pittsburgh Archive Craig Hall, fourth floor Volume 5550 200 S.

UT_HD29,"DIVERSITY: Activists say protests need to lead to policies  DIVERSITY: Activists say protests need to lead to policies Monday, August 10, 2020 By MARTY LEVINE Six local activists — some who have turned their protest efforts into political and policymaking posts — told the Diversity Forum what pushes them to keep working toward a more equitable world and why more people should join their efforts, at the July 30 panel, “From Protest to Policy: Environmental Justice, Economic Equity and Community Activism.” “Protest to policy is literally what my life has been,” Olivia Bennett, a member of Allegheny County Council, said in the online presentation. “The first thing that got me out in the streets was Trayvon Martin,” — a Black teen who was shot to death in Florida in 2012 by a white man on the excuse that Martin’s presence was suspicious; Martin’s killer was later acquitted. “From there it has been a continual presence on the street.” However, Bennett said, “Protest is not sustainable. So how do you continue making change? That is exactly what brought me to office. We need policy makers in those streets who will actually listen to (protest) and actually do something about that.” Although she has been encouraged by local efforts toward police reform legislation, she cautioned: “The policy should never come from the top down; it should always come from the bottom up.” Fred Brown, president and CEO of the local Forbes Fund, which helps build the management capacity of nonprofits, highlighted the different life experiences for white and Black people: Even after protesting, white people can walk back to their lives, while for Black people, the issues affect them daily and personally. “What’s very troublesome is when white people decide they want to do something great for Black people,” Brown said, then walk away to devise proposals, only later seeking approval from the community most directly affected. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityactivistssay 1/4 "", ""DIVERSITY: Activists say protests need to lead to policies | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The real question to address through policy, he said, is, “How do you support humanity? How do we put people at the center of our ecosystem?” “There is no such thing as equity at this point,” he added. When white people tell him they didn’t realize America’s systemic racism was this bad until the most recent protests, he wonders: “Do they hear us? Are they listening?” “Since Black people have been here in the United States, our struggle has been for freedom,” said Carl Redwood, adjunct instructor in the School of Social Work and community organizer with the Pittsburgh Hill District Consensus Group, which aims to build leadership among Hill residents through grassroots organizing. “We are abolitionists,” he said. “We believe that prisons and police and all other institutions that have put violence on Black people must be abolished and replaced … The current system we live in must be redesigned and reformed. … It’s important that we bring together a national Black liberation movement.” “Even this Diversity Forum shows that we are in a different moment,” said Anupama Jain, executive director of Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commission and a former Pitt professor. “What people are protesting is the lie of the American dream. … We do not have equity in our country.” And even policies designed for “uplift and improvement,” she said, have helped more white people than people of color, LGBT people or those with disabilities. “If we create a new policy, who are we leaving out? Who is not in the room?” Jerry Dickinson, faculty member in the School of Law, said his activism against evictions of Black residents in the poorer sections of several world cities, and his current research into eviction rates (finding them highest for single AfricanAmerican mothers), prompted him to run for the 18th state congressional district, to represent Pittsburgh. Although he did not win, he still sounds warnings about local conditions for Black residents: “This is one of the least livable regions for African Americans,” Dickinson said, citing a loss of Black population due to lack of jobs and housing, as well as bad air quality. “In the Pittsburgh region, we’ve left behind the Black and brown community” as we’ve transformed from manufacturing to education and medicine in past decades. “You don’t have to win (election) to make a difference,” noted panel moderator Kristin Kanthak, faculty member in the Department of Political Science in the Dietrich School of Arts & Sciences. Just running for office provides an example for others who may be inspired to follow suit, she said. Hillary Roman, Americans with Disabilities Act coordinator for the City of Pittsburgh, noted that it took many years for the disability community to agitate for, and achieve, the ADA law in 1990. “Try to think, how would you turn this into a policy?” she said of any issue that prompts public protest. “And understand it’s going to take a long time.” Taking questions from panel attendees, Kanthak noted that “the Department of Africana Studies exists because students insisted on it. Students protested.” What advice would panelists have to students, particularly incoming students, who wanted to get a start turning protest into policy? https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityactivistssay 2/4 "", ""DIVERSITY: Activists say protests need to lead to policies | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “Start with a noncolonizing attitude,” said Jain, by working on an issue that affects you personally. Don’t start by trying to devise solutions for other people, she said. Start with any injustices you see in your life. “You will not be colonizing someone else’s experience and you will be making important change.” “It’s difficult to give a student a real experience in a classroom framework,” to teach them to turn protest into policy, Brown said. “I don’t want a student for one semester. I want a student for many years.” He has found that such longterm experiences engage students to continue their work in the community. “We haven’t put our minds to this thing called equity,” he said. “It’s an interest and not a commitment. We get caught up in many courageous conversations as if we’re doing something. … That’s like changing the icing on a cake.” Asked why there was not yet a physical location for Pitt’s Community Engagement Center (CEC) in the Hill District, Redwood replied: “It is not a place, but there are some staff in place,” as well as students involved in ongoing community projects. But he was cautious about future relations between Pitt and Hill residents, since the University “has not had a good history there. Pitt has been a gentrifier in the past.” “A lot of Pitt’s outreach now has been good,” he allowed. “We have to make sure (the CEC) doesn’t become an outpost of Pitt.” It should not be “Pitt in the community, it is the community in Pitt.” Asked what white Pitt administrators should do to increase the low percentage of AfricanAmerican students and faculty at the University, he said: “I don’t know how they recruit football players, but I know they do it”; the same should be done to recruit Black faculty and staff, he said. “Folks are just going to have to give up their positions,” Bennett said. “White people are just going to have to step down from their positions of power and give them to Black people and people of color. If we’re really serious, we really need to recruit Black teachers and other teachers of color so students can see themselves in that way.” People should not sit in their jobs for decades anyway, Brown opined. “I’m never anywhere longer than five years, because I pick somebody to replace me” shortly after arriving. Concluded Jain: “Equity is a commitment, not a special interest we get to once in a while. It’s going to take some visionary thinking.” Noting that people are eager to go back to normal after COVID19, Brown added: “That normal still kills Black and brown people every day. I’m not interested in that normal.” “We really have to go to the root causes,” Redwood said. “We’re inside a capitalist system that makes sure a whole bunch of people are living in poverty. … There’s a whole system built over centuries” that depends on cheap labor. “The danger is, the model we are told to strive for is this socalled middle class. The middle class doesn’t work unless you have people in poverty. “Our goal has to be human development,” he said. “We’re stunting the development of human beings right now. …. The people who are benefiting from the current system ain’t going to be giving up without a fight.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityactivistssay 3/4 "", ""DIVERSITY: Activists say protests need to lead to policies | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Marty Levine is a staff writer for the University Times.

UT_HD30,"Passion for creating connections drives Pitt’s new placebased initiatives czar  Passion for creating connections drives Pitt’s new placebased initiatives czar Thursday, October 20, 2022 By SHANNON O. WELLS In this quasipostpandemic environment, where oncebustling offices remain quieter as employees wearing subFridaycasual attire while armed with Zoomloaded laptops work from makeshift home offices, Pitt’s Keith Caldwell takes the opposite approach. Caldwell is the new executive director of placebased initiatives in the Office of Engagement and Community Affairs. He and his staff are, by definition, out in the world — or more specifically, the greater Pitt community: engaging, making connections, addressing challenges while building bridges and relationships. Caldwell oversees operations at the University’s two Community Engagement Centers, and is working to develop a proposed center in Hazelwood. “It’s intentional, and takes a lot of work,” he says of the overall mission. “Our staff, across the board, really works hard to make sure that we’re at every table possible within the community. There’s lots of community meetings that are happening in each of these neighborhoods. And it’s so important for us to be at that table — and primarily as listeners. We want to be able to always hear what the community concerns are, what the community’s priorities are. “There’s places where we can respond or build connections. We’re happy to do that,” he adds. “But being at the table really makes a difference — and consistently being at that table.” Community Engagement Centers (CECs) are welcoming spaces designed to serve as the University’s “front door” for greater Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Their mission is to strengthen communities as well as Pitt, based on longterm placebased partnerships. They are the most visible aspect of Pitt’s Neighborhood Commitments initiative, a minimum 15year plan for investment, infrastructure, programming and dedicated staff in neighborhoods like Homewood and the Hill District. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/passioncreating 1/4 "", ""Passion for creating connections drives Pitt’s new placebased initiatives czar | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Familiar territory Caldwell comes to this role after 14 years on the faculty of Pitt’s School of Social Work. He joined the Engagement and Community Affairs team this past spring and stepped into the newly created placebased initiatives director position this summer. He says his classroom experience has served him well in the transition phase. “I think in any new situation there’s always a learning curve, but I’ve definitely had the opportunity to hit the ground running, I think,” he says. “My work within the school was very much community engaged, including in the neighborhoods where we focus our communication centers in Homewood and the Hill District. So there were a lot of things that I was already participating in, in some form or fashion. There was a lot of natural transition for me.” One of Caldwell’s first orders of business was to hire Michelle Stewart as director for the Homewood CEC beginning in September. A native of Homewood, Stewart joined the CEC after her predecessor, Daren Ellerbee, was named inaugural director of Pitt’s new University Academic Outreach Center in January. “That was an additional opportunity for her to connect with the community,” Caldwell says. “In (Stewart’s) case, reconnect in her new role (as) being someone who was born and raised in Homewood.” Caldwell and Stewart were greeted in September by a successful annual block party and celebration at the Homewood CEC. Caldwell says such annual events provide a way for his office “to continue to maintain and raise awareness about what we have available. “It was wonderful to see the volume of community members and residents who attended, and the number of University and community partners who had tables to share information about their work and opportunities to connect,” he says. “It was great for the whole family, and we had a beautiful day.” New hires, new space Other Pitt staff involved with the Community Engagement Centers are Lina Dostillo, vice chancellor of engagement and community affairs, who heads up the team; Janilah Ducar, executive director of the engaged campus, which oversees the Oakland neighborhood; Paul Supowitz, senior advisor for community affairs; and Nena Ansari, assistant director of operations for the CECs. That leaves an opening for director of the Hill District CEC that Caldwell and company are working to fill. “We’re embarking on another communityengaged hiring process, which, frankly, is a lot of fun,” Caldwell says. “It’s great to be able to pull community leaders into the process not only in the traditional ways in which people are promoting and sharing job opportunities, but really providing active insights into the qualifications and candidacy for this position.” Along with a new hire will eventually be a new Hill District CEC space. A renovation of the historic Granada Theatre at 2007 Centre Avenue will allow the CEC to move out of its current temporary residence in the Blakey Center on Wiley Avenue, known to many residents as the “Old Kay Boys Club.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/passioncreating 2/4 "", ""Passion for creating connections drives Pitt’s new placebased initiatives czar | University Times | University of Pittsburgh While the current space sparks many memories for neighborhood residents who drop in, Caldwell says the CEC staff looks forward to being the anchor tenant in the now under construction Granada. “We’re excited to be able to move over there and be just one part of the revitalization of such a community asset as the new Granada Theater. And what comes with that, of course, is all the opportunities for continued growth and Universitycommunity partnerships.” Hazelwood connection Probably Caldwell’s most daunting agenda item, however, is establishing the Hazelwood CEC, which is in the midst of a twoyear planning process supported by Heinz Endowments. With the neighborhood’s key goals and priorities already identified, Caldwell’s team is spending the time “intentionally planning, cocreating with both University and community partners, ways in which we can help leverage those lifesciences developments in a way that strengthens the community,” he explains. Areas identified include lifesciences infrastructure to support K12 STEM education, workforce development opportunities for Hazelwood residents, and inclusive community development. “We want to be able to partner with universities and community organizations to help ensure that the current Hazelwood residents, businesses and cultural community assets are able to remain and thrive as a result of this exciting new development that’s happening,” Caldwell says. As engaged as Caldwell is with these projects and all that connecting Pitt with the neighborhoods and residents surrounding it involves, he still finds time to enjoy his friends and family. Caldwell has two children, a fourth grader at Woodland Hills Elementary School in Turtle Creek and another attending Woodland Hills High School. “So they keep us pretty busy, between all of their sports and getting their homework done, and until they get driver’s licenses, driving them every place they need to be,” he says, adding it was his wife that got him to know Pittsburgh neighborhoods in the first place. “My wife is the reason I’m here. I’m from Maine originally, and in college met a girl from Pittsburgh — and that was it.” Shannon O. Wells is a writer for the University Times. Reach him at shannonw@pitt.edu.

UT_HD31,"Library system gets $1 million to support August Wilson archive  Library system gets $1 million to support August Wilson archive Friday, August 26, 2022 The University of Pittsburgh Library System has received a $1 million grant from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation to support the opening of and the public’s engagement with its August Wilson archive. This grant, the largest in the history of the Pitt library system, follows two years of support and other charitable donations toward indepth public engagement with the archive, which is scheduled to open to the public in January. In 2020, the ULS acquired the archive of the acclaimed Pittsburgh native, considered one of the greatest American playwrights. All 10 plays in his American Century Cycle were produced on Broadway — two earning Wilson the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Most are set in Pittsburgh. “Pittsburgh was such a formative influence on August Wilson’s work and shaping his worldview,” David K. Roger, president of Henry L. Hillman Foundation, said in a news release. “The ability to preserve the archive here in Pittsburgh where it will be accessible to audiences who grew up in the neighborhoods featured in Wilson’s storytelling is gratifying.” Roger said this project would not have been possible without the help and collaboration of Constanza Romero, who was married to Wilson from 1994 until his death in 2005. The archive is “helping to create an unprecedented view into the creative process of a singular American playwright,” Roger said. The ULS will partner with other local cultural organizations to provide a weeklong celebration of the legacy of August Wilson in March 2023. The August Wilson African American Cultural Center, in downtown Pittsburgh, has a permanent exhibit detailing the writer’s life and works, The late playwright’s childhood home in the Hill District was recently restored and reopened as the August Wilson House, which will become an arts center for creative young people. The opening was attended by actor Denzel Washington, who has been a strong https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/librarysystemgets1 1/2 "", ""Library system gets $1 million to support August Wilson archive | University Times | University of Pittsburgh supporter of Wilson’s work. He directed and starred in the film version of “Fences” and produced “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” — both of which filmed in Pittsburgh. Washington and Romero cochaired the house reopening, which drew donations from notables such as Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry. At ULS, funding from the Hillman Foundation will support the final stages of processing the archive — comprising more than 450 boxes of materials such as draft scripts, artwork, plaques, correspondence and a guitar — and focus on partnering with groups and organizations both locally and nationally to see the Wilson archive come to life. “The Henry L. Hillman Foundation grant will enable us to integrate the August Wilson Archive in the very fabric of the local cultural and civic life,” Kornelia Tancheva, ULS director who also is the grant’s principal investigator, said in the news release. “Wilson's work was deeply informed by his experiences growing up in the Hill District neighborhood of Pittsburgh, which makes the opportunity to share this collection with those communities, local schools, and cultural and arts organizations incredibly satisfying.” University of Pittsburgh Archive Craig Hall, fourth floor Volume 5550 200 S.

UT_HD32,"Collaboration helped bring antiBlack racism class together quickly  Collaboration helped bring antiBlack racism class together quickly Friday, August 28, 2020 By SUSAN JONES The speed with which Pitt moved to provide an antiBlack racism course for firstyear students is a credit to the committee that worked on it, according to Yolanda CovingtonWard, head of Pitt’s Africana studies department and chair of the committee. COURSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS Yolanda CovingtonWard: committee chair, and chair and associate professor of the Department of Africana Studies Oluchi Okafor: student representative from the Black Action Society studying Africana Studies and political science Keisha N. Blain: associate professor in the Department of History Nicole Mitchell: Endowed Chair in Jazz Studies in the Department of Music Alaina Roberts: assistant professor in the Department of History Felix Germain: associate professor in the Department of Africana Studies Waverly Duck: associate professor in the Department of Sociology Leigh Patel: professor in the School of Education and former associate dean for equity and justice Gabby Yearwood: lecturer in the Department of Anthropology Michael Goodhart: professor in the Department of Political Science and UCIS, Director of Global Studies Center James Huguley: assistant professor in the School of Social Work and interim director of the Center on Race and Social Problems Dawn Lundy Martin: professor in the Department of English and director of CAAPP https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/collaborationhelped 1/5 "", ""Collaboration helped bring antiBlack racism class together quickly | University Times | University of Pittsburgh But some in Faculty Assembly were left wondering how the class came about and whether it was required for graduation. CovingtonWard said Provost Ann Cudd reached out to her directly to chair a committee to create the course, and even though she had other work planned this summer, “I said, ‘You know what, this is a priority, not just for our institution, but for our nation and really the world.” She then reached out to people “across the university, who I thought had experience and expertise in antiBlack racism.” And in about a month, they pulled together a series of 50minute lectures that they hoped would connect the course material to what’s going on locally and nationally after a summer of unrest initially sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in late May. “It was kind of a perfect storm at a perfect time,” Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said, citing a petition started by a Pitt alum asking for a course like this. It probably was surprising how quickly this moved ahead, he said. “It was a very collaborative effort,” he said. “This was not a back room with a small number of people, this was a pretty big effort. When something moves that quickly with a big team, I think that just speaks more about the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose that people have. I take two lessons: One it was the right thing to do in this context, and the other lesson is when we really want to, we can move quickly.” The course, “AntiBlack Racism: History, Ideology, and Resistance,” will be taught by a series of Pitt professors, such as Eric Beeko, a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Africana Studies, on PreColonial African History and Misconceptions of Africa, and Leigh Patel, a professor in the School of Education, on Formal Schooling and AntiBlackness. They will be joined by community members, such Carl Redwood, chairman of the Hill District Consensus Group, who will discuss U.S. Racist Housing Policy, and Darnell Moore, author of “No Ashes in This Fire,” and Bree Newsome Bass, who led the fight to take down the Confederate flag in South Carolina, who will discuss Contemporary Black Liberation Movements. Each week features an asynchronous lecture, along with some required readings and some recommended readings. During week seven, in lieu of class, students will be asked to attend at least one synchronous activity during the Black Study Intensive from Sept. 28 to Oct. 2, a week in which the Center of African American Poetry and Poetics will hold virtual performances and creative sessions open to any discipline and the general public. CovingtonWard gave particular credit to Mike Bridges in the Center for Teaching and Learning for helping with the tech side of the class and Amanda Godley, vice provost for Graduate Studies, who is supervising a teaching assistant from the School of Education who is developing questions for students to answer after each module and is helping with student inquiries. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/collaborationhelped 2/5 "", ""Collaboration helped bring antiBlack racism class together quickly | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Faculty Assembly questions A string of emails between Faculty Assembly members and others last weekend raised several issues, although none questioned the motives behind creating the class. The class is required for firstyear students and available to any others. It will be graded as Satisfactory or Not Completed. Students were automatically enrolled in the free course. It is just one of the many initiatives Pitt has taken in the past few months to address systemic racism. The questions were first raised by Patrick Loughlin, professor and associate chair of Bioengineering in the Swanson School of Engineering, who said in his email that he had received queries from colleagues about the class that he couldn’t answer. Subsequent emails helped clear up questions he and others had, Loughlin said. Is this a degree requirement? The class is not formally a degree requirement, said Joseph McCarthy, vice provost for Undergraduate Studies. While it will count toward the required credits for graduation in many (if not all) instances, it is not a specific requirement of any degree from any of the schools/campuses of Pitt at this time. If a student receives an NC grade for this course, it will appear on their transcript as such, but will not impact their GPA nor their ability to graduate. What are the policies and procedures governing how a course is approved and mandated across all disciplines? McCarthy said this academic year is the first time the University has utilized a universitywide subject code (PITT). For a course to be offered across all disciplines, the Provost’s Advisory Committee on Undergraduate Programs (PACUP) approved a pilot whereby a course needs to gain the support of more than one school or campus. Next, PACUP must vet the syllabus and agree that the course is of broad enough significance that it fits the subject code and that PACUP is willing to examine the assessment of learning outcomes to assure that the course is worthy of continued offering. In the case of the antiBlack racism course, both the School of Social Work and the School of Education confirmed that they approved of the course and PACUP was unanimous in its support of using the PITT subject code. The first course offered under the PITT subject code was PITT 0130 Wellness and Resilience. Part of the confusion over how the course came about is linked to previous discussions in Faculty Assembly about a proposal from Pitt alum Sydney Massenberg, and a subsequent petition signed by 7,200 people, to have a threecredit Black Studies general education requirement. The onecredit course, which was outlined to the Senate Educational Policies Committee (EPC) by McCarthy, is not intended as a substitute for the proposed threecredit class, Senate President Chris Bonneau said. In the email chain, Bonneau answered concerns that faculty were not involved in approving the Universitywide course: “The ‘process’ in this case, while unorthodox, was not without Senate involvement, in particular myself and the EPC. Everyone involved was (1) keen to get something operational quickly given the current climate on campus, in our community, and in our country; (2) understood that the Massenberg proposal was going to be vetted by the usual process, and (3) wanted to incentivize students to take it seriously (hence offering credit) but not place an additional full course on students without the usual process (hence making it asynchronous and pass/fail).” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/collaborationhelped 3/5 "", ""Collaboration helped bring antiBlack racism class together quickly | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Bonneau said in an interview, “It was a way for us to react quickly to a changing scene that touched the lives of so many people in our community and continues to do so. We’re going to discuss broader reforms in due time, but here’s something we could implement relatively quickly and show that we take this seriously and we’re making steps, and I think it’s going to do a lot of good.” CovingtonWard said eventually the lectures will be available to faculty and staff, and Bonneau said he’s looking forward to taking it. As for the threecredit course, he said he would prefer to have a range of classes students could take to fulfill the requirement. “I think students learn best when they are engaged with the material. Giving students some choice, while ensuring that these courses still fit the general topic, is generally, I think, a better way to go.” The Education Policies and the Equity, Inclusion and AntiDiscrimination Advocacy committees will be discussing the threecredit course this fall. What about other minorities? Another question raised in the emails and by others is whether this class should include information about the struggles of other targeted minorities, such as antiSemitism, LGBTQ discrimination, and women’s rights and suffrage. CovingtonWard says antiBlack racism goes back to the United States’ “original sin” of slavery. “While many other groups have histories of similar kinds of experiences around discrimination, the root of antiBlack racism is really tied to the dehumanization of black lives that goes back to slavery. I think that it’s very important to mark that as a very particular vexing part of race relations in this country. If you think about it in terms of racism in our country, there are these poles of black and white, and everyone who falls in between. That is how our nation has been set up for hundreds of years. “I think that it’s very necessary to talk about the ways in which other groups have been discriminated against. … But the ways in which antiBlack racism plays out has a very particular kind of aspect that’s tied to slavery. This is the reason why you don’t have the same repercussions for killing someone who is Black than you do for someone who is not. This is the reason why Black men in particular are experiencing particular higher rates of incarceration. All of these things are tied to that history. You have to understand that long history in order to understand where we are today.” Susan Jones is editor of the University Times. Reach her at suejones@pitt.edu or 4126484294.

UT_HD33,"Diversity in the workplace means everyone feels they belong  Diversity in the workplace means everyone feels they belong Friday, August 28, 2020 By MARTY LEVINE When Sherdina Harper — crosscultural programming coordinator and advisor in Student Affairs — accompanied a busload of mostly sorority women to Pitt Make a Difference Day a few years ago, her group was assigned to help clean up a local park. The group got off the bus, she recalled, and a male park worker immediately expressed doubts that women could handle the park improvement work. After the women picked up their shovels and completed the project, the same man could only say, “I bet you all got your ADHD out of your system.” Finally, when sounds from the shooting range at the bottom of the park became audible, he couldn’t resist saying, “I bet you hear shots all the time” — since Pitt in Oakland is right next to the Hill District. Harper, born and raised in the Hill, told the man she had never actually heard a single shot growing up. But he wasn’t done; as the women boarded the bus to return to campus, he told the Pitt bus driver, “Let’s take these women for a ride.” Harper had been trying all along to tell the man that his comments were inappropriate, but he wasn’t listening. She had had enough. “It’s our job to teach first,” Harper said. “I teach. I nibble. Then I chomp.” Harper — speaking as part of the latest Staff Council diversity talk, “Won't You Be My Neighbor: Diversity In The Workplace,” on Aug. 14 — said that such comments are not part of the workplace: “We have to make sure when (people) come to work, they are protected.” Everyone has heard of safe spaces, where people feel OK to be themselves without facing the atmosphere those Pitt sorority women experienced in the park, Harper said. She’d like there to be “brave spaces” as well. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityworkplacemeans 1/3 "", ""Diversity in the workplace means everyone feels they belong | University Times | University of Pittsburgh She invited participants to ask “questions you have never asked before …. It’s never my intention to offend anyone in these trainings. But to walk away feeling challenged is a great thing.” She hoped the talk would take assumptions we have made over the years and “dig them up by the roots.” “Are we ready to say that it is OK to disagree but I still accept you and respect you?” she said. First, Harper said, diversity extends beyond those distinctions protected by law, such as race, religion and sexual orientation, to include socioeconomic status and language, political and occupation diversity, immigration status and overall life experiences. How to change our culture at work? “We want to establish a sense of belonging for everyone. It’s not a onesizefitsall approach. We have to create these environments in our own workplace to accept everyone’s strengths. “Hiring goals may boost diversity numbers,” she cautioned, but “no one is going to come with all the knowledge of understanding everyone’s culture.” Harper offered a series of hints for respecting differences and recognizing different ways of communication among colleagues: Maximize joy and connection, minimize fear: “We need to not only put out where there is room for improvement but spotlight the moments of success and celebrate them.” Forget ‘fix’ and focus on helping individuals thrive: Don’t just hire, train and reward “people who ‘fit in.’” Recognize your own bias, prejudice and stereotypes: “We work in a place where people from all over the world work” and can learn much from this breadth of diversity. Identify similarities: “Find some things you have in common and build relationships on that.” Recognize body language: “It sometimes speaks a lot more” than words. Understand voice volume: “That’s just my culture. That’s just me coming forth with my passion and my zeal.” Asked for ways in which white people can be better allies for other groups, she answered: “The fact that you want to is a first step. One of the things you can do is to try to educate yourself about as many cultures as possible.” Harper recalled her frustration at how she was being treated by one white Pitt colleague a few years earlier, and how another white colleague stepped in. “Sometimes when you can see your colleague has had enough, be a listening ear. “Privilege is not bad,” she added. “It’s what we do with our privilege. I have ability privilege,” as well as other privileges she can use to help those without them. “Look at some of the people who don’t have that privilege and meet them to help them out.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/diversityworkplacemeans 2/3 "", ""Diversity in the workplace means everyone feels they belong | University Times | University of Pittsburgh At the end of Harper’s talk, Staff Council President Andy Stephany asked her: “As a leader of different types of teams, I want to acknowledge my privilege and encourage new voices to come forward. How do I walk the line of inviting, welcoming and mentoring new voices, while recognizing their potential reluctance to speak up?” “Everybody’s not going to be there first,” Harper responded. “I don’t fear confrontation … if we create confrontation in a very respectful way, that conflict can be resolved. “A lot of students come to me and my colleagues and ask questions,” she said. “One of the things I always say is, at the end of the day, I’m always going to be truthful and I’m always going to empower.” Marty Levine is a staff writer for the University Times.

Friedman grew up in East Liberty and LincolnLemingtonLarimer, attended Pittsburgh Public Schools and a Catholic high school and earned Pitt degrees from the College of General Studies and School of Education, then worked for the School of Public Health as a researcher, health coach and yoga instructor for the Healthy Black Family Project, 200521. To have “authentic, honest relationships,” she said, both sides must “listen to understand, not to respond. Speak your truth. … If you’re a talker, hold back a bit. If not, speak up. “We don’t grow unless there is some stress applied,” Friedman continued. “We don’t grow unless we stretch our understanding of others. How to stay in an uncomfortable space? How to stay in a space to have these connections that really knock you off your center? It’s a slow process. Do I feel a sense of urgency? Yes. People are dying while we’re figuring this out.” She teaches raja yoga, with its practices of restraint and selfdiscipline, but emphasizes that other practices may be just as fruitful. “Remembering who we are in the legacy of racism and oppression” is to notice how you are affected and affecting other people, she emphasized. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/staffcouncilspeaker 1/3 "", ""Staff Council speaker coaches on ‘undoing oppressions’ | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Asked to give advice to people who might be intimidated when attempting to make changes in a large institution, such as Pitt, Friedman suggested that you “choose a space where you have some level of influence … and speak your truth in that space.

The PUP committee became the CUPS committee after votes by Faculty Assembly on Feb. 16 and Senate Council on Feb. 24 approving the name change. The addition of safety to the name reflects an area the committee has long considered part of its purview. Read more about the name change in committee cochair David Salcido’s Senate Matters column. As part of the change, the committee also has asked someone from Pitt’s public safety department to be a regular contributor at its meetings.

He also took questions and comments from committee members about if and when swipe access to Pitt buildings will end.

It didn’t exist preCOVID,” said Bonneau, who also noted the difficulties it creates in bringing guests into University buildings. “I think there’s significant apprehension on behalf of faculty and staff that this may stay, and if it does stay, it’ll fundamentally change who we are as an institution and how we operate.” Fritz said he shares Bonneau’s concerns and worries about the expense of maintaining the concierge stations. He said the future of the swipe system is on the agenda to be discussed soon. “Perhaps in some places it makes sense, maybe in others it doesn’t,” he said. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/whenwillswipeaccessgo 1/3 "", ""When will swipe access go away, committee wants to know | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “I think it is a subject that’s open to debate, and I will say that not everybody feels that way either,” Fritz said. “I get both sides of it, and I hear people that do want more security or more restriction to building entry.” Community engagement Lina Dostilio, vice chancellor of engagement and community affairs, detailed some of the changes in the Office of Engagement and Community Affairs, which was split off last year from the Office of Government Relations. In addition to Jamie Ducar moving into the role of executive director of the Engaged Campus, Keith Caldwell has moved from the School of Social Worker to run the Community Engagement Centers’ Continuity & Impact. He’ll help guide the Homewood and Hill District CECs, as well as the newly announced CEC in Hazelwood. There’s no location yet for the Hazelwood facility, but Dostilio said it will house a School of Nursing nurse practitioner clinic, an Office of Child Development outlet and will work closely with the BioForge being developed at Hazelwood Green. The office also is looking for someone to work on data and impact measurement as part of its leadership team. In addition to Pitt’s Community Engagement Map, Dostilio said, “We also generate all different kinds of data points relative to the kinds of activities that are out there. We need somebody that’s comparing all of those data and helping us to understand what the eventual impacts of our work would be. Because it’s not really sufficient to do things places, what we’re hoping to have is an impact on people’s lives, or the environments around us or broadly, the communities around us. And so this is a person that for us is going to really lead in that area.” The person in this new position also will help Pitt maintain its Carnegie Classification in Community Engagement, which it received in 2020 and is reconsidered for every six years. Residence hall life Julie Bannister, assistant vice chancellor for auxiliary services, shared a few updates about oncampus student life, including: Pitt is in the process of purchasing the Marriott Residence Inn hotel on Bigelow Boulevard, which it will turn into housing for graduate and upperlevel students. The space has 171 apartments — one and two bedrooms units and studios. There also are opportunities for meeting spaces within the former hotel, which Pitt is leasing this academic year to house the overflow of firstyear students. Family House, which provides space for families of patients at area hospitals, will be vacating the space it currently has in the University Club building sometime in the next few months. Bannister said that space also will be converted into housing for upperlevel students. It would add 84 beds to the oncampus housing portfolio and also have additional space for meetings.

UT_HD37,"Pitt behind a ‘long line’ of groups planning to provide COVID19 vaccine  Pitt behind a ‘long line’ of groups planning to provide COVID19 vaccine Thursday, February 25, 2021 By DONOVAN HARRELL Even though the Pennsylvania Department of Health approved the University of Pittsburgh as a COVID19 vaccine provider, it may be a while before the vaccine is more widely available to the Pitt community. Melissa McGivney, the associate dean for community partnerships at the School of Pharmacy, said at the Feb. 17 Senate Council meeting that due to high demand and low supply, the University falls behind “a very long line of people who’d like to provide the vaccine.” The University does not have its own vaccine, McGivney said, but Pitt is partnering with UPMC and the Allegheny Health Department for its vaccine distribution efforts, dubbed the “PITTCoVax” Initiative. The “Co” refers to both “collaborative” and “COVID.” So far, a majority of Pitt’s patientfacing students in the health sciences and about 5,000 healthcare personnel have been vaccinated through the partnerships, McGivney said. And the Peterson Event Center is also standing by and “is ready to go at a moment's notice,” once more vaccines are available for distribution, McGivney added. Most recently on Jan. 28 and 29, Pitt partnered with the Allegheny County Health Department to distribute the vaccine to over 800 patientfacing students from seven nearby colleges at the center. Pitt’s Community Engagement Centers in Homewood and the Hill District also have distributed vaccines to more than 2,000 people who were 65 or older, McGivney said. Nearly 200 Pitt community members and volunteers helped with the distribution. The University will be able to conduct 28day followup visits, McGivney added. She thanked CEC leadership for building the partnerships to make this possible. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittbehindlongline 1/3 "", ""Pitt behind a ‘long line’ of groups planning to provide COVID19 vaccine | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Pitt also has purchased ultracold freezers to be able to store the Pfizer vaccine, and is continuing to refine the IT infrastructure for registering and booking vaccine appointments. McGivney and Chancellor Patrick Gallagher reminded the Pitt community to fill out the Pitt Vaccine Survey, which was sent out on Jan. 28. They said the survey will help the COVID Medical Response Office determine who is eligible for vaccination and how vaccines are distributed once the vaccine becomes more widely available at Pitt. COVID19 numbers on campus Since students began returning to residence halls on Jan. 29, there have been 67 students who have tested positive for COVID19 on the Oakland campus as of Feb. 22. There have been 11 cases on the Johnstown campus and one at Bradford. In that same time period, 26 faculty or staff members, who have been on the Oakland campus in the previous 14 days, have tested positive. Since Jan. 11, more than 2,000 students have participated in surveillance testing on the Oakland campus and only 10 tested positive. The Greensburg campus, which has had only 13 student cases and six among employees since Aug. 1, was moved to the Guarded status on Feb. 22. The other campuses remain at the Elevated status.

UT_HD39,"Harper was law school’s first Black tenured professor | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Harper was law school’s first Black tenured professor Friday, November 5, 2021 Robert Berkley Harper, first Black tenured professor in the School of Law, died Oct. 12, 2021 at 82. “Bob was a largerthanlife figure in the law school for many years,” said his former colleague Arthur Hellman, now professor emeritus, who arrived at Pitt in the middle of Harper’s first Pitt Law post as the school’s assistant dean (197377). “He was one of the most engaged teachers we've ever had at the law school, because he loved being with students and talking to students.” Hellman recalled seeing Harper in the school’s hallways, surrounded by debating students. “They'd follow him on the elevator to get up to the fifth floor,” where faculty offices are located, and continue the discussion there. “For Bob, the class meetings were just the start of what he felt were his responsibilities as a teacher. “He was something of a performer, always conveying ideas in a way that would help students understand them but also keep their attention,” Hellman said. “Bob was a very bright, bighearted person,” said another longtime colleague, Lawrence Frolik, now emeritus professor. “He cared about the law and he cared about people. “Bob had an upperlevel class in evidence and that class was always heavily enrolled,” Frolik recalled — even though this course was not required and Harper could be tough on students who weren’t prepared to respond in class discussions. “When he retired, he was a loss to the school,” Frolik said. Born in the Hill District, Harper graduated in 1958 from Fifth Avenue High School as a member of the National Honor Society. He earned his undergraduate degree in education from Pitt in 1962; had a stint in the Army, including time in Korea as a first lieutenant; and eventually entered Pitt’s law school, graduating in 1971. He worked for the city’s police bureau as chief legal adviser before joining the Pitt faculty. Hellman and Frolik both remembered Harper as a force for compromise in a profession trained to argue persistently for your own side. In committee meetings, Hellman said, “he was always focusing on the task at hand and pushing us to do it efficiently … In faculty https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/passings/harperwaslawschool 1/2 "", ""Harper was law school’s first Black tenured professor | University Times | University of Pittsburgh meetings, he was always one to find the middle ground — to bridge the gap and allow faculty to reach a consensus.” Relatively late in his career, Harper began a new focus on education law, which was rare at the time. This placed him greatly in demand at education conferences, Hellman said. “He really did have a gift for taking complex legal topics and explaining them in a way that people without a legal education could understand … without distorting them or making them simpler than they were,” Hellman said. “Bob found an entirely new audience for Pitt expertise … In that sense he was an ambassador for the law school.” Harper is survived by his brother Henry (Yvonne).

(Aimee Obidzinski | University of Pittsburgh) By SUSAN JONES Last year, Pitt’s signature fall volunteer opportunities — Pitt Day of Caring for faculty and staff and Make a Difference Day for students — were curtailed because of the pandemic and organizers instead developed online educational and engagement events for Civic Action Week. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/civicactionweek1 1/4 "", ""Civic Action Week combines discussions and service projects | University Times | University of Pittsburgh This year, organizers are bringing back the inperson volunteer events and building on the conversations that happened last year for the second Civic Action Week, from Oct. 4 to 9. This year’s theme is Dialogue, Deliberation and Disruption. “We had reached a point before COVID that we wanted to start to innovate and rethink what service and community engagement look like for our populations,” said Shenay Jeffrey, assistant director of PittServes, which is working with the Office of Engagement and Community Affairs to organize the week. The COVID19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement sparked deep conversations last year that continue now, and part of the week’s activities include carrying on that dialogue through speakers and workshops. “We know that the work that we did with direct service was much needed; it was essential,” Jeffrey said. “We also wanted to complement that in a strategic way around more indepth conversations, but also to showcase that there are many different ways to make an impact on your society and to be civically engaged.” “Not only is it, I think, a big difference when you can get people together to talk and deliberate and really think about some of the critical issues that are facing neighborhoods and communities in the region,” said Alex Toner, assistant director of community, “but when you really get people out in the community, working alongside those residents and neighborhood leaders, understanding the intersections of some of these areas, I think it makes much more of an impact and gets people engaged in ways that Zoom really can’t.” All of the events for Civic Action Week fall under six Pathways for Public Service and Civic Engagement (click on the links to find opportunities in each category): Community Engaged Learning and Research: Connecting coursework and academic research to communityidentified concerns to enrich knowledge and inform action on social issues. Community Organizing and Activism: Involving, educating, and mobilizing individual or collective action to influence or persuade others. Direct Service: Working to address the immediate needs of individuals or a community, often involving contact with the people or places being served. Philanthropy: Donating or using private funds or charitable contributions from individuals or institutions to contribute to the public good. Policy and Governance: Participating in political processes, policymaking, and public governance. Social Entrepreneurship and Corporate Social Responsibility: Using ethical business or private sector approaches to create or expand marketoriented responses to social or environmental problems. “We wanted to again go deeper, and think about how we bring about change; who brings about change; what change is not being brought about; and what does change look like,” Jeffrey said. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/civicactionweek1 2/4 "", ""Civic Action Week combines discussions and service projects | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The week will kick off with two keynote addresses — one with University leaders from 10 to 11:30 a.m. and another with community leaders from 4 to 6 p.m. — discussing what Dialogue, Deliberation and Disruption mean to them and how they are being used in their work. The speakers and workshops throughout the week will be open to the Pitt community for inperson attendance, and anyone else who is interested can access the livestream. The inperson service projects are limited to Pitt faculty, staff and students because of liability issues. Jeffrey said most of the projects will follow universal COVID19 precautions such as masking and social distancing. The service projects will mostly take place on Oct. 8 and 9. Like previous years, the Friday projects will be completed by faculty and staff, and the Saturday work is primarily for students. Jeffrey and Toner encourage people to sign up early to get the pick of the projects. Registration and a list of projects can be found here. Toner said in 2019 a record number of faculty and staff — more than 300 — turned out for Pitt Day of Caring, and they’re hoping to get more this year. The 10 projects on Friday are with community groups such as People’s Oakland, Operation Better Block in Homewood, Family House, and the Oasis Project at Homewood’s Bible Center Church. Toner said faculty and staff will gather between 8 and 9 a.m. for a kickoff with coffee and doughnuts and then they will be bussed to their work locations, returning between 2 and 3 p.m. There are two groups — Millvale Community Development Corp. and Friends of South Side Park — getting attention from Pitt employees and students over the two days of service. A new addition this year are three service projects during the week: Western Pennsylvania Conservancy landscaping work at Parkview Drive and Boulevard of the Allies on Oct. 5; Grounded Strategies for work on their garden beds in the Hill District on Oct. 6; and Friends of the Riverfront trail maintenance near the Hot Metal Bridge on Oct. 7. “We hope people walk away from Civic Action Week this year moving toward action in their individual and professional lives,” Toner said. “I think being civically engaged is probably at the forefront, more than it has been in this current decade,” Jeffrey said. “I would say in many ways COVID has taught us a lot about how we are in relationship with each other, and how much that affects everyone. And I think that’s the lesson within what we think about civic action, that our actions are collective.” Susan Jones is editor of the University Times. Reach her at suejones@pitt.edu or 7242444042.

UT_HD43,"University community steps up to help out this holiday season  University community steps up to help out this holiday season Thursday, December 17, 2020 By SUSAN JONES This time of year often brings a flood of options for how to help out others. There are toy drives, free meals and multiple ways to donate. The pandemic has made many of these efforts a bit more challenging in 2020, but that hasn’t stopped members of the Pitt community from stepping up to do their part. Pitt–Bradford WAYS TO HELP OUT In lieu of the annual Christmas Day at Pitt event, the University and its community partners are working together to identify and create opportunities for assistance and support. Here are some ways you can help out: Holiday wish lists: Fulfill the holiday wish lists of Hill District youth through a partnership with Macedonia FACE. Find the wish lists on Amazon here and here. When checking out, change the shipping address to the Gift Registry address so you don't send the items to yourself. There is no hard and fast deadline for purchasing Amazon items as FACE staff is prepared to get items to family through the end of the year.

Shop 2 Help Oakland: Show your support for your favorite shops, restaurants, retailers, and other businesses by purchasing a gift card. Shop vendors from The Black Market: Holiday Edition online Find additional volunteer opportunities via Pittsburgh Cares or the United Way of Southwestern PA The Pitt–Bradford campus collaborated this year with the “ELF Fund,” a local program that provides gifts for less fortunate children and seniors during the holiday season. “Elves” choose a tag with the recipients wish list, purchase and wrap a gift, and return it to ELF headquarters for distribution to families. The ELF Fund fulfills hundreds of tags and ensures that every child and senior in the area has something under the tree Christmas morning. This year, the ELF Fund was almost without a home to collect, sort and distribute gifts until Pitt–Bradford offered the use of a recently purchased building that will become part of the campus footprint next year. The building provided volunteers with the space, facilities and access for socially distanced “drivethrough” gift drop off and pick up. In addition, PittBradford faculty, staff and the Habitat for Humanity student organization filled 50 gift tags for the fund. Pitt–Greensburg Since 1998, the Housing & Residence Life office at Pitt–Greensburg has coordinated a Christmas party for the Jeannette Head Start. Although they weren’t able to host the kids on campus this year, they were still able to give something to the children and their families. Faculty, staff and students came together to buy gifts for 32 children and more than $1,500 in Giant Eagle gift cards to their families. The deadline to participate was Nov. 17, and Troy Ross and Brian Root, director and assistant director of Housing & Residence Life, respectively, dropped off the gifts the week of Nov. 29. Students from SPSEA, a preprofessional association for students in education, helped provide personalized messages from Santa for each child. The campus also participated in preparing Chemo Totes that will be distributed to patients receiving chemotherapy. This fall, the campus community was invited to sponsor bags or donate toward the purchase of items for the bags. The totes typically contain everything from blankets to knitted hats, along with a personalized tag. Holly Hallman, whose husband Craig is an assistant men’s basketball coach at PittGreensburg, started this project with 48 totes in 2017. In 2019, the project had grown to 415 totes handpacked by volunteers and delivered to patients in the Greensburg area. PittGreensburg’s men’s and women’s basketball teams have assisted with the packing and delivery of the totes, which usually occurs during winter recess, and they’ll be back at it again this year while incorporating prescribed COVID19 protocols. Brody Jackson and Kelsey Oddis, the men’s and women’s basketball coaches, respectively, organize the contributions and the distribution process for the teams. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/universitycommunity 2/5 "", ""University community steps up to help out this holiday season | University Times | University of Pittsburgh CFO’s office People in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer support the Treasures for Children campaign that’s managed by the Salvation Army of Southwestern PA. This year, employees in the CFO’s office, as well as from Business and Operations, provided specific gifts that were requested by 130 children. Gifts were shipped directly to Salvation Army headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh. Staff also made direct contributions to the Salvation Army to support the program. This effort is led by Stacey Czerniejewski and Katrina Lowe in the CFO’s office. School of Social Work The School of Social Work had two opportunities for people to help out this holiday season. During previous years, the school has supported a toy drive for Primary Care Health Services in the Hill District. Because of the pandemic, Primary Care scaled back from its annual toy drive and instead asked for gifts cards to be purchased from major retailers, such as Target, Walmart and Giant Eagle, and then mailed or dropped off at its Centre Avenue office. For those who were looking forward to purchasing gifts or wanted to help sort, wrap or deliver gifts to children in need, the School of Social Work partnered with the Latino Community Center’s Navidad in Pittsburgh program. Participants could buy presents from gifts tags on an Amazon wish list or send gift cards or volunteer to wrap and deliver gifts. Overall, the community center had 483 children who were sponsored by people throughout Pittsburgh. Office of University Communications The Office of University Communications and Marketing was able to coordinate a gift drive for 54 children from the Hilltop Community Children’s Center in Pittsburgh’s Knoxville neighborhood entirely remotely this year, since everyone is working from home. Instead of a whiteboard in the office with paper stockings, an online signup chart was created both for those who were buying gifts and “Helper Elves,” who were designated to pick up the gifts from each person. The office has been providing gifts to the center for 25 years. Pitt Athletics Celeste Welsh, director of Media Operations and Community Engagement, and Pitt Athletics stepped in to host a drive in support of the Community Empowerment Association’s Annual Kwanzaa Celebration. Usually, a number of gifts from the Christmas Day at Pitt dinner get picked up and driven to Homewood by the association’s staff. This year, Pitt is bringing the gifts to them. More than 100 gifts will be dropped off Dec. 18 with help from Dave Huey of Facilities Management and the transportation team Office of Human Research Protection Every year, the Office of Human Research Protection, part of Pitt Research, does some type of charity project in lieu of exchanging gifts in the office. In the past, they have adopted families and kids to give gifts, participated in the Foster Love Project drive for backpacks for https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/universitycommunity 3/5 "", ""University community steps up to help out this holiday season | University Times | University of Pittsburgh foster kids, and collected for the women's shelter. Last year, they also held a food and fund drive for the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank and went to the food bank in February to volunteer for a day. This year, they decided to raise money for the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank with an online fund drive, since “the need is even greater with the pandemic and people out of work,” Erin Holmes Grabowski, quality assessment specialist, said in an email. “The food bank can really stretch a dollar and can do so much more with a monetary donation than with a food donation.” The fund drive launched on Dec. 8 with a goal of $1,000. The Office of Research Protections also is participating in the drive, along with family and friends. School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences The Audiology group provides free hearing aids for individuals in need in the Southwestern PA area through two programs at the Birmingham Free Clinic and the Squirrel Hill Health Center. This program depends on Communication Science and Disorders faculty and students, UPMC Audiology, the Eye and Ear Foundation, and the Schweitzer Foundation (the students involved are Schweitzer Fellows). Even during COVID, they have continued to run this program and support these individuals. In addition, the Student Academy of Audiology Chapter at Pitt this fall collected aluminum tabs that were recycled for the Ronald McDonald House along with toiletries to make Welcome Bags that were provided to families staying in the house.

UT_HD44,"Pitt in the Making: When diversity was the ‘bye’ word  Pitt in the Making: When diversity was the ‘bye’ word Friday, July 30, 2021 Editor’s note: Pitt in the Making is a new occasional series looking at the history of the University. By MARTY LEVINE “The doors of racial prejudice which have barricaded the University of Pittsburgh medical school for more than 20 years have been blasted!” declared the Pittsburgh Courier on May 4, 1935. The Courier, with its headquarters in the Hill District, covered the Black community locally and throughout the world. The weekly newspaper was not beyond a bit of hyperbole. But in this era, when Blacks were barred from everything from restaurants to juries, and Congress could not bring itself to pass an antilynching law, the paper’s outrage was rarely unjustified. “Breaking like a bombshell,” the paper said, was the news that Pitt School of Medicine administrators could neither deny nor justify the fact that only two Black students had attended the school, one graduating in 1915 and the other not graduating at all. In the same state investigation that found Pitt kicking out liberals and not granting tenure (see the July 2 University Times), University officials also faced questions from the Hill’s state legislator, Homer Brown, about a “color bar” at the med school and a state panel heard testimony from local Black doctors and the NAACP. The medical school dean, R.R. Huggins, told the panel that “to his knowledge, no qualified colored student had applied for admission to the medical school during his regime.” At the same time, Chancellor John Bowman “denied the responsibility of the color bar and indicated that it is not the policy of the University,” and professors from Pitt’s law and history departments told legislators that “many” Black students at Pitt “had ranked with the most brilliant in the University.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittmakingwhen 1/3 "", ""Pitt in the Making: When diversity was the ‘bye’ word | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “Huggins finally admitted that he had not examined or personally contacted any of the Negroes who had made applications,” the Courier reported. “Queried further as to whether any discrimination existed in the school, he replied ‘No,’ but added: ‘There is a difficulty because the hospitals would not give colored men the medical practice they need in their third and fourth years’” — when their course of studies moved from books to bodies. “Huggins’ contention on this score was also blasted a few moments (later) when he admitted that he had never received any word from any hospital official to the effect that Negroes could receive no clinical work there. He added, however, that his belief was based upon his own personal opinion.” One of the local Black doctors, W. Roderick Brown — Homer’s brother — was then a staff member at the Tuberculosis League Hospital locally and had participated in cardiology classes at the Allegheny General Hospital. “During that time they handled a great number of patients, only three of the entire number were colored, but none of the whites ever registered dissatisfaction or complained about the presence of a Negro physician,” he testified. Huggins admitted his faculty might be able to persuade local hospitals to allow Black physicians to gain handson training there, if it came to that. But it would be easier if local Black people had their own hospital, he said. It could even be located on Pitt’s campus, he volunteered. The NAACP said that at least six Black students had attended Pitt’s School of Medicine between 1900 and 1915, “but during the past 30 years there have been no advanced students in the school. Among the local doctors who testified, Paul Knott … stated that (he) had applied for admission to the medical school and had been refused.” The sole graduate, Richard Fowler (according to a report quoted in the School of Medicine’s history, “A Century of Excellence”), had likely been able to complete the medical school program because “he looked like a white man.” Pitt was not alone in admitting classes full of white, mostly AngloSaxon Protestant men, of course. Most Black medical students attended Black medical schools, at such places as Howard University and Meharry Medical College. “By 1930,” the history says, “approximately 100 blacks were graduated from medical schools annually, but only 68 internships were open to them. Before 1950 the rate at which blacks were granted medical degrees each year rarely kept pace with the death rate among older black physicians. And while blacks were required to meet the same standards as whites, their opportunities for professional advancement were circumscribed.” By June 22, 1935, the Courier did not hesitate in labeling the med school’s policies “Jim Crow” in a headline, saying the legislators, in their concluding report, had made a “wholesale condemnation of the Pitt officials.” W. Roderick Brown, by the time he died in 1965, had been director of the Allegheny County Health Department’s tuberculosis control program and on the staffs of two hospitals. He and Paul Knott were named to the teaching staff of Pitt’s medical school in 1949. Congress, by the way, finally passed the antilynching law — in 2020. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittmakingwhen 2/3 "", ""Pitt in the Making: When diversity was the ‘bye’ word | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Marty Levine is a staff writer for the University Times.

UT_HD45,"20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program  20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program Thursday, July 15, 2021 Twenty projects will receive funding as part of the 2021 Pitt Seed Grant program. The program, now in its fourth year, provides startup funding to transformative projects that support the goals of Pitt’s strategic plan. “Once again this year, proposals for Pitt Seed Grant funding were exceptional,” Provost Ann Cudd said. “That said, this year’s selected projects — focused on transformative ideas in the social justice, equity and inclusion spaces — are particularly exciting, and I look forward to seeing the results of those efforts.” More than 70 total applications were received, including 59 from faculty and 15 from staff. Ninety volunteers from across Pitt participated in reviewing the applications. Their recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by Provost Cudd before being presented to and approved by Chancellor Patrick Gallagher. The 20 projects and their primary applicants are: The Pitt Cyber Range: Ahmed Ibrahim, faculty, School of Computing and Information The Pitt Cyber Range, a sandboxed environment to simulate real attacks and defenses, will have a societal impact on a broad range of learners. It will be used 1) in the security courses offered by the School of Computing and Information, 2) by students in cybersecurity clubs to prepare for national competitions, 3) in outreach to underrepresented groups to provide an accessible and affordable way to increase diversity in the cybersecurity field and 4) to enhance and promote advanced cybersecurity education through a series of workshops for learners and educators across the country. Building the Foundation of a Diverse Health Care Workforce: Andrea Hergenroeder, faculty, Pitt Interprofessional Center for Health Careers https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/20projectsselected2021 1/6 "", ""20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Pitt’s Interprofessional Center for Health Careers will connect with existing units on campus and build new programs that extend the University’s excellence in health professions education to its undergraduate underrepresented minority (URM) students who aspire to healthrelated careers. Outcomes will include a 1) strengthened system of mentoring URM students into healthrelated careers, 2) a campus culture supportive of prehealth students from diverse backgrounds, 3) a more diverse pipeline of Pitt alumni entering graduate professional programs and 4) a transformed environment that results in Pitt becoming a recognized leader in preparing the array of health providers needed to ensure the health of underserved and diverse populations. Screenshot Asia: Connecting Pittsburgh to 21st Century Film and Media: Charles Exley, faculty, Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences The Screenshot: Asia Film Festival, starting October 2021, will bring together students, faculty and community members around a shared interest in Asia as a rapidly developing and essential part of the 21st century global economy and our region’s shared love for contemporary film and media arts. The weeklong event will showcase films from northern Asia to the Middle East. Our themes, Global Asia (2021) and Inter/Media (2022), give us the flexibility to engage with local ethnic communities, Asian and AsianAmerican student interests, film lovers and the broader public eager to learn more about Asia while celebrating artistry, diversity and humanity through cinema. The Neighborhood Academy Social Justice Education Initiative: David Herring, faculty, School of Law The project engages students from the Schools of Law, Social Work and Education to teach students at the Neighborhood Academy, a high school where all students are Black and in serious financial need. Through its intensive college preparatory program, the Neighborhood Academy works to break the cycle of generational poverty. Pitt students will work with project faculty to develop and teach a social justice course focused on constitutional law and Black history for the academy's juniors and seniors. The course will be a homeroom from which students will implement actual social justice projects in the Pittsburgh community. Creating a Culture of Inclusive Excellence to Promote Retention: Doris Rubio, faculty, Institute for Clinical Research Education As Pitt embarks on a clusterhiring initiative, it is imperative to change the University’s culture to one of inclusive excellence. To do this, we will create a Getting Connected Series, open to all faculty of color, where we will focus on careers in academia, leadership and community building. We will also form Learning Communities with new faculty hires to explore the issues raised during the Getting Connected Series, practice new skills learned and address any challenges. By providing opportunity to meet the leadership, form communities and connect to the University, the program will contribute to creating an inclusive culture. Serving Those Who Protect the Public: The Pitt Center for Emergency Responder Wellness: Eric Meyer, faculty, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Emergency response personnel (ERP) protect the public, despite occupational hazards that threaten their mental health. This center will be a clinical innovation hub that 1) delivers accessible, culturally adapted, evidencebased mental health interventions; 2) trains the next generation of health science students to work with ERP; 3) fosters the success of local https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/20projectsselected2021 2/6 "", ""20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program | University Times | University of Pittsburgh ERP peer support networks and 4) as a future goal, makes major contributions to the scientific understanding of posttrauma recovery processes. Goals for the seed phase are to establish a team, build collaborations with local ERP departments, demonstrate feasibility and initial clinical impact and compete for federal funding. Computational Genomics Training Program: Fangping Mu, faculty, Center for Research Computing Recent years have seen rapid advances in highthroughput technologies in biology. Investment in high performance computing clusters, such as the HTC cluster managed by Center for Research Computing, have made computational resources increasingly accessible to interpret the results of such experiments. However, a pressing challenge that many research groups face is a lack of readily accessible bioinformatics expertise. Our aims are to 1) design and teach approximately 40 threehour computational genomics handson workshops during the coming two years and 2) design and manage a web forum platform to allow Pitt researchers to pose questions and offer solutions to bioinformaticsrelated problems. Infant Oral Health Education at the Pitt Community Engagement Center at Homewood: Jacqueline Burgette, faculty, School of Dental Medicine Healthy Teeth, Healthy Me meets community needs in Homewood by providing education on oral health and connecting families with services to keep children’s mouths healthy. Faculty and students from the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dental and Social Work provide this interprofessional oral health education at the University of Pittsburgh’s Community Engagement Center in Homewood. This approach develops a collaborative workforce to improve child health while also addressing a communityinspired and communityinformed need. Healthy Teeth, Healthy Me impacts not only the child’s overall health, but the quality of life for families in the Homewood community. Reading Interventions for Students with Exceptional Learning Needs: Jonathan Chitiyo, faculty, Special Education, Pitt–Bradford This grant will support a research study to assess the efficacy of a unique reading intervention strategy to help students with learning disabilities and other students with exceptional learning needs with reading problems. The ultimate goal of the study is to inform the development of new methods courses for our current education curriculum to ensure our education majors learn, practice and apply relevant, researchbased methods of teaching reading to students with special needs. Through this Pitt Seed project, PittBradford will strengthen our connections with the community as we expand what our education majors will bring to the teaching profession. Early Bridge Program at PittGreensburg: Kelli Maloy, faculty, English, Pitt–Greensburg Since 2017, the Bridge program and its summer component, Early Bridge, have served atrisk students admitted conditionally to PittGreensburg by offering support services to promote academic success. For the past four years, these students have completed a oneweek intensive summer program prior to the start of the fall semester. However, low rates of persistence/retention, good standing, graduation and graduateschool enrollment indicate a strong need for more robust support. The grant funding will support the development of preparatory courses in algebra and composition comparable to 1.5credit courses, which will be offered over a period of four weeks beginning in July 2021. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/20projectsselected2021 3/6 "", ""20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Creating a Diverse Cybersecurity Workforce: Leona Mitchell, faculty, School of Computing and Information The cybersecurity skills gap remains a significant challenge in the industry. The increase of complex cyberattacks has escalated the need for qualified resources. Faced with this challenge, employers are searching for candidates outside of tech, but transitioning to cybersecurity from a nontech field is difficult. Furthermore, today’s cyber workforce is underrepresented; men outnumber women by three to one, and underrepresented groups make up less than 15% of the workforce. Our project aims to bridge this skills gap through a series of asynchronous boot camps, making cybersecurity education more accessible while helping to address the skills shortage in the industry. Pitt Commons Social Capital & Professional Networking Evaluation: Lisa Belczyk, staff, Office of the Provost Pitt Commons is an online platform designed exclusively for members of the Pitt community. Utilizing a blend of organic use and programming, the platform allows students, faculty, staff and alumni the opportunity to develop career networks, facilitate mentoring relationships and, ultimately, cultivate social capital, leading to enriched opportunities. Although we can analyze discrete interactions within platform usage, we do not have the ability to quantitate user outcomes or evaluate the effectiveness of digital engagement methods. This study will allow us to understand the current landscape of platform usage and align resources and interventions to encourage user behaviors for optimal outcomes. Lusosphere through the World: Luis Vanfossen Bravo, staff, Center for Latin American Studies, University Center for International Studies The Center for Latin American Studies and the European Studies Center at the University of Pittsburgh are jointly working to develop a program in Lusosphere Studies. For students who wish to pursue a career or perform research with an international dimension, or in the Lusosphere specifically, studying this history and the crossregional relationships that now exist in the Portuguese speaking world would provide multiple opportunities. Such a program would be among the first of its kind in the United States and could become a central location for the study of Portuguese language and the Lusosphere cultures. Cultivating a Data Science Learning Community: Matt Burton, faculty, School of Computing and Information This project will address the growing demand for informal data science training from students, faculty, postdocs and staff across disciplines at Pitt and build a sustained learning community. The demand for informal training offered by the School of Computing and Information and the libraries has outpaced capacity. To address this demand, this project will scale up informal data science training through guided and selfguided instruction with student workers. To complement informal instruction, the project will create a diverse and inclusive data science learning community that supports learners during and after workshops, hosts events and maintains a space for further informal learning and collaboration. Social Listening for Institutional Resilience: Raymond Wrabley, faculty, Political Science, Pitt–Johnstown https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/20projectsselected2021 4/6 "", ""20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Tens of thousands of conversations about our brand, community, students and programs are flowing all around us through digital channels, and yet the University often misses these conversations. Social listening technologies allow institutions to track and analyze digital conversations for actionable insights that can improve services; uncover new needs; and engage potential students, community stakeholders, staff and faculty to advance our mission. We propose to harness the power of social listening for a period of two years to enhance the capabilities of our admissions team, improve services to students and promote our role in bolstering the region’s employment and reputation. Fostering Civic and Cultural Competency Across the Disciplines Via Digital GameBased Learning: Ronald Idoko, staff, Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Conventional civic learning mediums at the University of Pittsburgh come with inherent barriers to broad student participation as they are communicated and facilitated disparately and often compete against prevailing academic/social commitments, making it impractical and implausible for most Pitt students to engage them accordingly. The COVID19 pandemic has further impeded student access to these mediums with the requisite transition to remote engagement. This project aims to create a digitally accessible, gamified civic learning technology to aid Pitt students in fostering their civic and cultural competence and develop an objective, longitudinal assessment of their competence. Active Accommodations for Laboratories: Rory Cooper, faculty, Human Engineering Research Laboratories Students with disabilities face barriers while attending university courses that require handson laboratory activities. Typically, those students are forced to take a passive role rather than actively participating in the labs, which leaves them with a subpar education. This project will attempt to provide students with disabilities the necessary accommodations for them to actively participate in their lab activities along with their peers to the greatest extent possible. Promoting PEERs: Creating an Inclusive Environment through Tiered Mentoring to Promote Diverse STEM Communities: Sarah Hainer, faculty, Biological Sciences, Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences The lack of racial and ethnic diversity within academia, across STEM programs and within the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh can be an isolating factor for historically underrepresented students, or persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs). Stereotype threat, structural exclusion and a low sense of belonging can hinder performance in classes and decrease engagement in extracurricular activities including research. We propose to develop a tiered mentoring and professional career development program for graduate and undergraduate students who are historically excluded from STEM with the goals of 1) building a community with increased belonging, 2) increasing exposure to highimpact research experience, 3) increasing recruitment and retention of diverse student populations and 4) preparing students for positions in STEM, both within and outside of academia. Wicked Problem Innovation: Community Development in Pittsburgh’s Hill District and Hilltop Neighborhoods: Stephanie Dangel, faculty, School of Law This Pitt Seed project will allow Pitt Law, Katz Business and other faculty, staff, students and alumni to work with local stakeholders to codesign a transformative Wicked Problem Innovation course on how universities should support marginalized communities in https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/20projectsselected2021 5/6 "", ""20 projects selected for 2021 Seed Grant program | University Times | University of Pittsburgh addressing neighborhood development challenges. Seed funding will supplement University support with community consulting, provided by Pitt’s Community Engagement Center in the Hill District, the UrbanKind Institute and a project coordinator. The initial pilot course will focus on addressing community development challenges in Pittsburgh’s Hill District and Hilltop neighborhoods, including challenges in reconciling the sometimesconflicting goals of racial equity, economic development and environmental sustainability. Understanding, Building and Achieving Diversity and Inclusion Excellence in the University of Pittsburgh Entrepreneurial Ecosystem: Susan Cohen, faculty, Katz Graduate School of Business Pitt aspires to foster research of impact and a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Yet, it is unclear how these aspirations are supported or achieved through Pitt’s translational, tech transfer and commercialization activities. Literature suggests societally beneficial inventions often have small commercial markets, and entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups may be less successful in attracting funding, making it difficult to jointly maximize DEI, commercial value and societal impacts. We propose to study how DEI is incorporated and promoted in Pitt’s entrepreneurial ecosystem to identify opportunities to reconcile tradeoffs between societal impact and commercial value, and promote excellence in DEI. — From Pittwire University of Pittsburgh Archive Craig Hall, fourth floor Volume 5550 200 S.

UT_HD46,"Humphrey says Pitt taught her leadership skills that she’ll take to Carlow  Humphrey says Pitt taught her leadership skills that she’ll take to Carlow Friday, June 18, 2021 By DONOVAN HARRELL Kathy Humphrey’s 16 years at Pitt are coming to end as she transitions into her new role as the 11th president of Carlow University on July 1. Humphrey, Pitt’s senior vice chancellor for engagement and secretary of the Board of Trustees, first came to Pitt in 2005, serving as vice provost and dean of students until moving to her current role in 2015. Humphrey has been a busy, prominent leader on campus dedicated to making Pitt an inclusive environment for the LGBTQIA+ community. Some of her achievements include helping develop the CrossCultural Leadership Development Center and Office of Diversity and Inclusion. The University Times talked to Humphrey about her achievements on campus and how Pitt impacted her life personally and professionally. The conversation has been edited for conciseness and clarity. How are you feeling now that your time at Pitt is ending? It’s very bittersweet. I’ve been at Pitt for 16 years. That’s a long time to be in one community. I feel knitted to this community in so many ways. I am sad to leave this community every day. But I’m excited about the work I’m going to continue to do as well. Of course, nobody wants to leave their colleagues. But … I am excited about gaining new colleagues and gaining a new community and the work that is ahead of us at Carlow. What made you decide to take on this new position, and will you be moving? I will continue to stay in my house that faces the Cathedral of Learning. The fact that I get to stay in Pittsburgh, that I get to maintain all the relationships that I have because I’m just down the street makes this a nice transition. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/humphreysayspitttaught 1/4 "", ""Humphrey says Pitt taught her leadership skills that she’ll take to Carlow | University Times | University of Pittsburgh When I came to the University of Pittsburgh, I told (former chancellor) Mark Nordenberg that my ultimate aspiration was to become a university president. I said to him that I was willing to come to the University of Pittsburgh if they were willing to give me opportunities and skills that would help me to become a strong university president. And in return, I would help them build a strong undergraduate student experience. And I feel like both of us held our end of the bargain up. And then when I started working for Pat Gallagher, he too gave me other opportunities that strengthen my abilities to become a university president, and that’s why I stayed longer — because of the opportunities to gain more skills, more knowledge. How did your family react to the news? Whatever university I work at my family attaches to that university as if it’s their very own. I have to tell you, initially, my family’s like, “Oh, no, we love Pitt. Why are you leaving?” I explained to them, they could continue to love Pitt, but we have to transition now. I think they were excited that I was moving on to do that which I had been training to do and aspired to do. I think they were pleased that I was going to a place where I believed that I could continue to make a difference in the lives of students. At Carlow, 42 percent of students are Pelleligible, and 23 to 26 percent of the students are AfricanAmerican and Black. And I was both of those. I was Pelleligible. I am Black, and I know what can happen to a student who is first generational if they are given opportunities and chances. Going to Carlow, for me, is about not just changing the students’ lives, but changing generations. And the fact that it’s faithbased — I am Christian — that was another real consideration for me as well, to be at a place that’s very close to my faith. What are some of your accomplishments at Pitt that you are most proud of? I’ve had an incredible run here. Rarely do people get to work at institutions where they believe that they’re helping the institution with its goals to move forward but I feel like I’ve been a part of that. And it’s been exciting, to say the least. The initial work that I came to do is probably what I’m most proud of. I came here because Pitt needed to create an undergraduate experience that students would feel connected to the University, that they would retain at a higher rate, and that they would graduate at a higher rate. All of those things have materialized in the 16 years. I was given the goal of helping students, to retain 93 percent and 94 percent, we’re there today. We weren’t there when I came. We overhauled freshman orientation so that within the first six weeks of school, we knew that students felt connected. We knew that somebody knew every student’s name and that even though we were a large institution, it was important to me that students knew that we knew who they were, and we were concerned about them. I’m proud of the work that Kenyon (Bonner, dean of students) took on and has kept moving forward even to this day. And I’m just pleased every time I see a student with a shirt on that says, I love Pitt. I believe in these 16 years; we’ve been able to develop some really strong alumni for the future. And universities depend on their alumni as they get older and as they grow. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/humphreysayspitttaught 2/4 "", ""Humphrey says Pitt taught her leadership skills that she’ll take to Carlow | University Times | University of Pittsburgh I’m proud of the students that have come into my life personally. I go to graduations; people call me for birthday parties …. I’m thrilled with the relationships that I still have with many of them today. Those students still call me Dean Humphrey, wherever I go. I was proud to be Dean Humphrey and I enjoyed that job tremendously. I’m proud of the communications team, of course. The community relations team is huge for me. I think we are not where we should be with community relations, but we are a long way from where we were with the development of the Community Engagement Center strategy and the implementation and completion of the center in Homewood, and the start of the one in the Hill District. I’m proud that we opened our Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. That was huge for me. When I moved into this role as the senior vice chancellor for engagement, it was important for me that, institutionally, we were doing this work. So, when Pat Gallagher gave me the green light, and I thank God for Pat Gallagher because let me tell you, without a green light in this space, you can’t make any progress. He said systemic racism, we have to do something about it. We started down that road to creating a better Pitt, a more just Pitt. The work that we had to do in the LGBT community, we are light years today, from where we were when I came here 16 years ago What are some of the leadership lessons that you’ve learned here that you’ll take with you to Carlow? I’ve learned the power of listening. Not just with my ears, but also with my eyes, and also with the feel of the space. I didn’t realize how much I immersed myself into the environment to determine how people are doing and how people are feeling until I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t feel the environment on Zoom. That was interesting to me from COVID 19. I’ve gotten many opportunities to try to inspire our community to do greater things. And I think that’s what a leader is. I think a leader inspires; they execute. You can do all the inspiration you want to, if you don’t execute, you are not a leader, because you’re not changing anything, you’re not making anything better, anything different. And I have happened to be one of those people that is motivated by the difference, by the change. I’m not motivated by standing in one place. What work remains to make Pitt more inclusive? I think we have a good year in front of ourselves. We know who we are. We know our strengths. We know our weaknesses in this area. So now it’s that next phase, we’ve got some strategies.

UT_HD47,"Hill District CEC’s soft opening shows off Blakey Center site  Hill District CEC’s soft opening shows off Blakey Center site Thursday, May 20, 2021 By DONOVAN HARRELL The Pitt Hill District Community Engagement Center held a soft opening last weekend for its new temporary home. Members of the University community, Pitt’s community engagement leaders, Hill District residents, and community organizers gathered at the center, socially distanced, to celebrate the opening on May 14 and 15 at the refurbished Blakey Center. Visitors also were able to view an art gallery and participate in various breakout sessions that highlighted the center’s capabilities. The event was livestreamed on the CEC’s Facebook page. The renovations to the 9,000squarefoot space began in January 2020 and finished in February. The center, which is currently a temporary space, has six rooms, each equipped with audiovisual equipment for multipurpose programs, and a conference room and computer lab. Hill District CEC Director Kirk Holbrook said the building housing the center was special to him, and that it honors the building’s namesake, Bill Blakey, who passed away in 2014. Blakey was the “patriarch of the Hill District community, a true example of what it means to be a Hill District resident that dedicates your life to improving the neighborhood from which you came,” Holbrook said. Blakey spent more than six decades as director of the building’s previous tenant, the Hill House Association. Marlo Hall, the center’s outreach coordinator, said the center’s rooms will be available for community members and organizations to conduct learning activities and events that promote teaching and service. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/hilldistrictcecssoft 1/3 "", ""Hill District CEC’s soft opening shows off Blakey Center site | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The event also highlighted the work the center has done in the community so far since Holbrook began working out of the Bedford Hope Center in 2018. Since then, the center has helped facilitate numerous science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics programs for children and adults. It also has provided a space for residents, nonprofit organizations and other community stakeholders to connect to better serve the community. Lina Dostilio, associate vice chancellor for Community Engagement, and Paul Supowitz, vice chancellor for Community and Governmental Relations, attributed the center’s success to Hill District residents, Holbrook’s hard work, previously existing community organizations and the center’s community advisory council for helping to make the center a reality. A video presentation featuring Pitt and community stakeholders outlined the center’s plans for a STEAM studio at the New Granada Center, the CEC’s future permanent home. When it’s finished, the CEC will double in size to 20,000 square feet. The studio will give community organizations in the neighborhood a space to hold activities and help show children career possibilities available in the STEAM fields. Holbrook said STEAM won’t just be an acronym for “science,” “technology,” “engineering,” “arts” and “mathematics.” The letters in the acronym can be swapped out to suit presenters’ needs and programming. For example, “E” could also represent “entertainment” or “entrepreneurship.” “I also want to highlight that the STEAM studio in the Hill is intended to be an enhancer to the overall community ecosystem,” Holbrook said. “We’re really excited to have such a strong focus around STEAM work as part of our Community Engagement Center because STEAM has the power to unlock human potential, both in youth and adults.” Donovan Harrell is a writer for the University Times.

UT_HD48,"Library acquires papers of Kuntu Repertory cofounder Rob Penny  Library acquires papers of Kuntu Repertory cofounder Rob Penny Wednesday, May 5, 2021 The University Library System has acquired the papers of Rob Penny, former chair of the Black Community Education, Research, and Development department (now the Department of Africana Studies) and a noted activist, playwright, and poet. “With the acquisition of Rob Penny’s papers, the University Library System is proud to continue to be a repository of such influential voices of Black performing arts and culture for both the region and the nation,” said Ed Galloway, associate University librarian for Archives & Special Collections. “The Penny papers, along with those of August Wilson, Erroll Garner, Vernell Lillie, Sala Udin, Bob Johnson, Bebe Moore Campbell, K. Leroy Irvis, Albert French, Tim Stevens and the records of the Kuntu Repertory Theatre Company, create a significant body of research materials on Black Voices in America held by Pitt.” The Penny collection includes approximately 150 boxes, with correspondence, writing tablets, photographs, scripts, audio and video recordings, awards, books and magazines. The collection documents Penny’s career as an instructor in the Africana/Black Studies department and includes production files and scripts for Kuntu Repertory Theatre performances, handwritten and typed poetry by Penny, documentation on the activities of the Kuntu Writer’s Workshop, and meeting minutes for the local chapter of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America. Penny was born in Opelika, Ala., in 1941, but grew up in Pittsburgh’s Hill District where he was childhood friends with August Wilson and Sala Udin, a Pittsburgh activist and former city councilman. “We called him Oba — Yoruba for king,” said Udin when describing Penny. “Oba was a quiet, but strong king. He, August and I were educated in the Catholic school system in the Lower Hill District, and then at Central Catholic High School. He wrote revolutionary poetry and plays incessantly.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/libraryacquirespapers 1/2 "", ""Library acquires papers of Kuntu Repertory cofounder Rob Penny | University Times | University of Pittsburgh In 1965, Penny, along with Nicholas Flournoy, Chawley Williams, and Wilson, cofounded the Centre Avenue Poets, and according to Larry Glasco, associate professor of History, “set out to write poetry that would capture life on and around Centre Avenue.” Penny was hired as part of the first cohort of faculty for the department of Black Community Education, Research, and Development by Curtiss Porter and Jack Daniels in 1969. He served as chairman of the department from 1978 through 1984. As an associate professor, he taught several courses, including Black Consciousness, Introduction to Black American Theatre, and Introduction to Black Poetry in America. Along with Vernell Lillie, Penny founded the Kuntu Repertory Theatre in 1974. Penny served as the playwrightinresidence of the Kuntu theater for nearly 30 years, writing many of the plays they staged, including their first production, “Little Willie Armstrong Jones.” His plays were produced by the New Federal Theatre and the Billie Holiday Theatre in New York and other venues across the U.S. In 1976, Penny, along with Wilson, launched the Kuntu Writer’s Workshop, which helped local writers develop and publish their work.

UT_HD49,"Hill District CEC prepares for soft opening at Blakey Center  Hill District CEC prepares for soft opening at Blakey Center Friday, April 9, 2021 Kirk Holbrook, director of Pitt's Hill District Community Engagement Center, is ready to show off the renovated spaces, like this classroom, in the center's new home in the Blakey Center. (Aimee Obidzinski | University of Pittsburgh) By DONOVAN HARRELL Kirk Holbrook began working in the Blakey Program Center 10 years ago, mentoring and teaching 20 to 30 children each day in the Hill District. The building’s namesake, Bill Blakey, who passed away in 2014, was a major influence on Holbrook and the work he would end up doing for the next 20 years. Blakey spent more than six decades as director of the building’s previous tenant, the Hill House Association. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/hilldistrictcec 1/6 "", ""Hill District CEC prepares for soft opening at Blakey Center | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “Mr. Blakey was a friend … a mentor, an example of what it means to be a man that cares about the community,” said Holbrook, director of Pitt’s Hill District Community Engagement Center. “And there’s nothing he loved more than the Hill District.” As Holbrook, who once ran the CEC out of a temporary office in the Bedford Hope Center, prepares for the soft opening of the Hill District CEC next month in the same building his work began in, he can’t help feeling like his work has come full circle. “I think Mr. Blakey would be proud that the space has been activated, and I’m a key part of that activation,” he said. The soft opening will take place in the center from 3 to 5 p.m. May 14 and from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. May 15. It was originally planned for April 23 and 24, but a recent spike in COVID19 cases in the region led the University to change its risk posture from Guarded to Elevated Risk, pushing the opening the back, Holbrook said. Renovations on the building began in January 2020, but the pandemic also delayed the construction process until it wrapped up in February, Holbrook said. The Blakey Center space for the Hill District Community Engagement Center now includes a conference room. (Aimee Obidzinski | University of Pittsburgh) With the new space, Holbrook’s staff will continue to grow. He’s already brought on a new outreach coordinator and will open up a receptionist position soon. Similar to the model in the Homewood Community Engagement Center, Pitt students from the School of Social Work and school organizations will help provide services to the community through the Hill District CEC. Holbrook said the programming for the opening is still being finalized, but it will be livestreamed to the Pitt Hill District CEC Facebook page. Holbrook is expecting about 70 people from the community to visit the center in person if the pandemic doesn’t alter plans again. The soft opening will highlight some of the center’s work during the pandemic and will show the space’s potential once it’s up and running. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/hilldistrictcec 2/6 "", ""Hill District CEC prepares for soft opening at Blakey Center | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Participants will have the opportunity to tour the 9,000squarefoot space, which includes six rooms, each equipped with audiovisual equipment for multipurpose programs. The space also has a conference room and computer lab. The STEAM Studio The opening also will feature the unveiling of the STEAM Studio report, which details the University’s plans to make the New Grenada Theater the CEC’s permanent home. When it’s finished, the CEC will double in size to 20,000 square feet, Holbrook said. This report will highlight how the STEAM studio will work with programs already present in the community to create programing around science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. The work around STEAM won’t be confined to just the CEC’s spaces, Holbrook said, and the CEC will continue to partner with local schools to determine the needs of workforce development building for young people. “Pitt’s presence in the community through the CEC is intended to elevate the overall STEAM ecosystem in the neighborhood,” Holbrook said. Further, STEAM won’t just be an acronym for “science,” “technology,” “engineering,” “arts” and “mathematics,” Holbrook said. The letters in the acronym can be switched out to suit presenters’ needs and programming. For example, the “E” could represent “entertainment” or “entrepreneurship,” Holbrook said, depending on the programming. The “A” could mean “architecture” or “agriculture,” and the “M” could stand for “music” or “media.” STEAM disciplines will continue to be important, as the U.S. economy focuses on innovation in life sciences and technology, Holbrook said. The CEC’s work has and will continue to be developed with multiple disciplines and people of various age groups in mind, he added. “Part of it is sparking interest in young people, part of it is meeting the needs of residents who maybe are looking to transition into careers or just entering the workforce,” Holbrook said. \""It’s (about) how can we utilize our STEAM studio spaces in our Community Engagement Center, to really create these pipelines to opportunity.\"" While the home for the STEAM studio will be new, the concept goes back to 2016 and is rooted in a communitybased idea led by the Hill Community Development Corporation. The Community Development Corporation wanted to reimagine what the New Grenada Theater could look like once it was repurposed. After the it laid the foundation, Pitt was eventually selected as a new possible tenant that could help bring the vision to life through partnerships with community organizations long present in the community. Holbrook said he’s hopeful that a groundbreaking on the CEC’s presence in the theater will take place sometime in late May to early June, and the move will be finished by fall 2022. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/hilldistrictcec 3/6 "", ""Hill District CEC prepares for soft opening at Blakey Center | University Times | University of Pittsburgh How the CEC has impacted the community Since Holbrook took on his role in 2019, the CEC’s work has helped address skepticism and mend tensions between the community and Pitt, which acquired 7.5 acres of land in the Hill District in 2007, where the Robinson Court housing development used to be located, that became the Petersen Sports Complex. That displaced many people who are still missed today, said Donnie Kyte, a lifelong Hill District resident, entrepreneur and member of the CEC’s community advisory council. Even though the housing complex was torn down several years before Pitt bought the land, the debate over how to use that space raised tensions among community members, and it was on Pitt, Kyte said, to help “amend some of what you’ve broken.” Thanks to Holbrook’s work, the community’s perception of Pitt has improved. Now, Kyte said, it’s on residents to make use of the resources Pitt and the CEC have brought to the community. The pandemic also forced the CEC to adapt to an online environment. Hill District residents and say the CEC’s efforts during the pandemic have changed resident’s overall perceptions of the CEC and, as a result, Pitt. “There was a lot of work that was organized through the CEC that positively impacted the community in the height of the crisis,” said Rev. Paul Abernathy, director of FOCUS Pittsburgh, an organization that helps create programs to deal with the trauma these communities have experienced. Abernathy added that the Pitt CEC’s presence has filled a lot of needs left in the community after the Hill House ended its operations in 2019. “In many ways, the Hill House not only did things in the community, but they were the space where the committee convened,” Abernathy said. “And it seems that CEC has inadvertently assumed that role, which is really fascinating.” Abernathy was grateful for the CEC’s work around the COVID19 vaccine, especially in addressing community members’ hesitancy around getting the vaccine. The CEC, working with other community organizations, helped distribute the vaccine to more than 1,000 people in the community earlier this year. Other residents praised the CEC for helping keep the community connected in an online environment. The CEC provided remote programming for children in grades 3 to 12 and to seniors in the community. It also participated in the Beyond the Laptop program, in partnership with Pittsburgh Public Schools, to help give children access to devices and a steady internet connection. The CEC partnered with other previously existing organizations such as Neighborhood Allies, Level Up 412, to help give seniors access to devices and help teach them to use the devices. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/hilldistrictcec 4/6 "", ""Hill District CEC prepares for soft opening at Blakey Center | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The online programming has served more than 200 people in the community since October 2020, Holbrook said. All program participants received a wifi hotspot, and up to a year of internet access. “Those kinds of things are priceless in this community to make sure everybody is connected,” said Brenda Tate, a lifelong Hill District resident and member of the CEC’s community advisory council. “And although we’ve lost the people connectedness, Kirk in the CEC … has figured out a way to reconnect the people in the community,” she said, adding that it was particularly beneficial for seniors like her. Holbrook said that thoughtful collaboration between the CEC and existing community organizations and advisors will be key to the CEC’s continued success and helping remove systemic barriers for Hill District residents. Holbrook said now that the initial concepts of what the Hill District CEC could be have been realized, it solidifies Pitt’s presence as a community. “I really feel grateful for the journey that we’ve been on,” Holbrook said. “And grateful for all the community members who have been on this journey with me step by step since day one.” Donovan Harrell is a writer for the University Times.

UT_HD52,"Pitt, Newcastle share ideas on ‘placebased’ education  Pitt, Newcastle share ideas on ‘placebased’ education Friday, January 29, 2021 By SUSAN JONES Pitt isn’t just reaching out to its neighbors during the Year of Engagement. In a twoday event last week, the University reached across the Atlantic Ocean to share ideas for a “placebased” approach to education with officials from Newcastle University and its surrounding community in England. “We think the old days of universities sitting behind the walls — the socalled ivory tower approach — simply chucking stuff over the wall, whether that be research or graduates, and hoping that those research findings or that those graduates might be useful to somebody out there, really that those days should be long vanished,” said Chris Day, vicechancellor and president of Newcastle University, in the opening session of “The Role of Universities in Sustainable, Just & Inclusive Cities” on Jan. 21. “Working closely with our city and regional partners is the way to produce graduates that are truly needed by the local economy and other professions.” Pitt’s partnership with Newcastle goes back to 2016 and includes student and scholar exchanges. Day has visited the Oakland campus and Chancellor Patrick Gallagher was a guest at Newcastle in 2018. Both schools are in similarly sized, postindustrial cities. Last week’s event was organized by the University Center for International Studies. Kathy Humphrey, Pitt’s senior vice chancellor for Engagement, kicked off the conference by saying this is the first in a series of annual conferences with Newcastle “that will set the stage for defining a placebased approach to university education, in which we consider the community setting as central to the mission of the university. We also hope to produce an expanding global network of institutions committed to these ideas, committed to being more than a good neighbor, but a good partner with individuals, communities, businesses and local governments.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittnewcastleshare 1/3 "", ""Pitt, Newcastle share ideas on ‘placebased’ education | University Times | University of Pittsburgh At Newcastle University, Day said they have elevated engagement in place to the same level of attention as research, teaching and global strategies. To do this, they have established several pillars of engagement: Influence the local economy, not just from direct spending by the university, but by using research and development to attract investors and encouraging faculty and students to create startup companies. Health and wellbeing, through bringing hospitals, universities and local government together to drive economic growth in the health sciences. Play a huge role in cultural vibrancy of the city, including having a museum and galleries on campus that are open to the public. Widen opportunities through education, by trying to increase access of students in the surrounding area to the university. In his five years there, Day said the percentage of students at Newcastle who come from disadvantaged backgrounds has risen from 6 percent to 20 percent. Encourage researchers and the work that they do to play a role in local and national policy development. Mark Thomas of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance said that areas without anchor universities, like Pitt and Newcastle, “are trying to replicate the magic, without really the tools to do so.” In talking with companies looking to expand, “Universities are always the first thing that they ask about.” He said the alliance wants to make sure that “the universities have the tools, programs, public support that they need to really produce the talent and create the pipelines that will power our economy in the future.” Pitt’s Provost Ann Cudd said the “breadth and the depth of the outreach that Pitt does in a placebased approach has expanded exponentially” since her days here as a student in the 1980s. She cited the Community Engagement Centers in Homewood and Hill District, along with Pitt’s Office of Child Development, as key examples of this outreach. She said one of the areas she’s working on is changing the promotion and tenure rules within the university so that they reflect this increased emphasis on engagement and social impact. Also participating in the session was Pat Ritchie, chief executive of Newcastle City Council. The conference also included a discussion between Newcastle’s Chris Day and Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher, along with a plenary discussion on “Post Industrial Cities and the Sustainable Development Goals — A Framework for the Future?” and several breakout sessions.

UT_HD53,"Kathy Humphrey leaving Pitt for Carlow presidency  Kathy Humphrey leaving Pitt for Carlow presidency Monday, March 15, 2021 By SUSAN JONES Kathy Humphrey, Pitt’s senior vice chancellor for engagement and secretary of the Board of Trustees, will become the 11th president of Carlow University on July 1. Humphrey has been at Pitt since 2005, starting as vice provost and dean of students. She has been in her current role since 2015. At Carlow, she will replace Suzanne Mellon, who came to Carlow in 2013 and is retiring at the end of the 202021 academic year. She will remain at Pitt until the end of June. “After a robust national search, Dr. Humphrey emerged as an extraordinary leader who will propel Carlow into the future,” said Carlow Board of Trustees Chair Dorothy A. Davis. “Her dynamic vision will inspire and motivate Carlow students, faculty, and the larger University community with her courageous voice, effective skills and engaged involvement.” Prior to coming to Pittsburgh, Humphrey served in numerous senior posts at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Mo., and held positions at the University of Central Missouri, Warrensburg, Mo., and the University of Missouri, Kansas City, during her 30year career in higher education. Carlow, located just down Fifth Avenue from Pitt, is a private Catholic university with an enrollment around 2,000 and about 300 faculty and 200 staff members. “Kathy is passionate about improving students’ lives through higher education — a pursuit that seems woven into her DNA,” Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said in a statement. “Her ability to articulate and energize a vision — and then move it into action — is rivaled only by her commitment to supporting students and their success. I am deeply grateful for her friendship, partnership, leadership and service to the University of Pittsburgh, and I am excited to see Carlow University’s transformation continue on her watch.” Humphrey has been an active and very visible leader at Pitt. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/kathyhumphreyleaving 1/3 "", ""Kathy Humphrey leaving Pitt for Carlow presidency | University Times | University of Pittsburgh As dean of students, she developed the CrossCultural Leadership Development Center and moved Black and white Greek organizations from separate locations to one location. She and her staff also helped make the campus more inclusive for members of the LGBTQIA+ community by implementing genderneutral housing and bathrooms and changing Pitt’s diversity statement to include them. As senior vice chancellor, Humphrey helped create the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and expanded diversity programs offered at Pitt, including a certificate program and a variety of workshops. She also was very involved in the creation of Pitt’s Community Engagement Centers in Homewood and the Hill District. Humphrey also was instrumental in creating the Pitt Diversity Forum, which last year attracted near 10,000 online participants, and the Community Engaged Scholarship Forum, which honors work by members of the Pitt community with local groups. In January 2020, she was honored by Equipoise, Pitt’s AfricanAmerican/Black affinity group, with the Creating a Just Community Award. At the Equipoise MLK Unity Luncheon where she received the award, Dean of Student Kenyon Bonner said: “Kathy is a familiar presence to our students and comforting reminder of the things that make us all feel the same: valued, appreciated, understood, and most importantly, loved.” During the pandemic, Humphrey and her office have worked hard to keep the Pitt community connected, even though most people weren’t on campus. She helped create Pittwire Live, a website that highlighted online activities for Pitt students, faculty and staff to participate in from home. She also, along with Human Resources’ David DeJong, spearheaded a plan that allows staff to request up to eight hours per week from their work schedule to volunteer. Humphrey’s salary for this year is $427,993, although she and the other senior vice chancellors agreed in April 2020 to donate 10 percent of their 202021 salaries to the general scholarship fund, which provides tuition assistance to Pitt students. No plans have been announced yet for the search process for a new senior vice chancellor for engagement. In 2018, Humphrey was one of three finalists for chancellor of the University of Massachusetts­–Boston. All three withdrew their names from consideration after pushback from faculty at the school. Humphrey has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Central Missouri, Warrensburg, Mo.; a master’s degree in higher education administration from the University of Missouri in Kansas City; and a Ph.D. in educational leadership from Saint Louis University.

UT_HD54,"You don’t have to go far to find gentrification in Pittsburgh  You don’t have to go far to find gentrification in Pittsburgh Thursday, March 11, 2021 By DONOVAN HARRELL Gentrification displaces more than just people — it displaces culture and a sense of community. It’s also been going on since the birth of the United States. “The original public subsidy was the theft of land from the First Nations folks who lived in this United States because it was a settler colony,” said Carl Redwood, a community organizer in the Hill District. There were people who stole the land from Native Americans, and benefited and generated wealth from that stolen land, as well as from the stolen labor of Africans.” This was the original process, Redwood said, that set the stage for the modernday housing issues impacting marginalized communities across the country. Redwood was among several other panelists who discussed the complexities and history surrounding gentrification at “Gentrification in Pittsburgh: A Panel Discussion on the History, Effects, and What We Can Do About It” on March 12. Pitt Law Professor Gerald Dickinson moderated the virtual discussion, cosponsored by the Pitt Law Real Estate Association and the Office of Equity and Inclusive Excellence. Redwood said at the heart of the problem of gentrification — the process of how people in historically marginalized communities are displaced following an influx of wealthier people and businesses moving in — lies questions the country hasn’t come to terms with: “What is land for? Is land for community and for housing or is land for wealthbuilding and exchange value?” he said. This, in turn, creates systemic issues, “because it sets up the fact that there’s no way that the majority of people can have land and use it (for) wealthbuilding.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/youdonthavegofar 1/4 "", ""You don’t have to go far to find gentrification in Pittsburgh | University Times | University of Pittsburgh When a community faces an influx of wealth, the land values also rise, said Michael Kostiew, a partner for law firm Reed Smith. Developers who are driving the increases are receiving “lopsided” public subsidies and develop marketrate housing, he added. The market rates are often too expensive for the people who already live in the community, and the property values increase faster than the community can stabilize, said Felicity Williams, the programs policy manager and special assistant to the president at Hill Community Development Corporation. When these homes are too expensive for the people inhabiting the community, “you’re not building for that community, you’re building for new people to come into that community. And that is going to result in gentrification.” Williams said. Gentrification in Pittsburgh Before the Great Depression in the 1930s, people didn’t need to use mortgages to purchase homes, Redwood said, but when it ended, the federal government implemented policies to lighten the financial burden for families looking for homes in a newer, more expensive, market. By the end of the Depression, the federal government guaranteed banks that “they wouldn’t go broke if they gave mortgages to homeowners,” Redwood said. However, in cities like Pittsburgh, mortgages weren’t given to everyone. In a process often called “redlining,” banks didn’t loan money to families in Black communities and encouraged white families to buy houses away from those communities. Federal segregation policies further solidified the division. “The federal government had a racist housing policy from the beginning, but coming out of the Depression, the policy was homeownership for white families and rental for black families, essentially,” Redwood said. Poor white people also were adversely affected by this, he added. Gentrification and displacement are “intimately intertwined with capitalism and with white supremacy,” Williams said. Eminent domain, which gives the government the ability to seize property for public use as long as it pays market value, also has contributed to gentrification, Dickinson said. You don’t have to go far to see some of the outcomes of gentrification. You can see it in several Pittsburgh neighborhoods, including the Hill District, an historically Black neighborhood next door to the University’s Oakland campus, that has slowly eroded over the decades. The Lower Hill District in particular has faced this issue, Dickinson added. In the 1950s, the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain for “urban renewal” in the area, forcibly displacing an estimated 8,000 residents and tearing down 400 businesses, according to community activists and historians. The land became the Civic Arena, where the Pittsburgh Penguins played, and parking spaces. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/youdonthavegofar 2/4 "", ""You don’t have to go far to find gentrification in Pittsburgh | University Times | University of Pittsburgh The University of Pittsburgh also has “slowly eaten up the Hill District,” Redwood said. Athletic fields in the Petersen Sports Complex sit where Robinson Court public housing once was. Redwood said he still remembers the people who used to live there. “The people up in Robinson Court, I can still feel them,” he said. How gentrification stops At the end of the discussion, panelists suggested several approaches to combat gentrification. Williams said people in areas being gentrified should get involved in community groups and submit public comments at agency meetings at the city council level. It’s also important to keep elected officials accountable by voting in elections. Another way to address the issue is through policy, said Waverly Duck, an associate professor in the Department of Sociology. “I also think we need to look at institutional structural policies that are also pushing and pulling people in these various communities, whether it is housing policy, whether it’s economic policy, whether there’s healthcare policy. I think these things are interconnected; that it’s not just one issue that’s driving why someone is in a place,” Duck said Redwood suggested that people advocate for a largescale social housing development program that could build largescale public housing. This would loosen the grip banks and land developers have on communities and give the community members themselves more autonomy in their neighborhoods. “The gentrifier is the banks and the big developers,” Redwood said. “That’s who’s making the money in this whole scheme. It’s not the new white person that moved in next to you. Sometimes we fall into that, and we miss the point of looking at the banks and the large developers.” In the end, “we can’t end gentrification until we end racial capitalism,” Redwood said.

Food was certainly the biggest draw. People were happy to take the cannoli offered at the Pitt Catering Company booth and taste the El Jefe Bowl (brown rice, kale, black beans, charred corn, red onions, avocado and much more) from Roots Natural Kitchen, in Bloomfield and on Forbes Avenue in Oakland. Judah Cowen, owner of the Elegant Edge Catering Company in Squirrel Hill, was offering beefy kafta kabobs, bourekas (a cheese pastry), breads and sushi with tahini and other sauces. The long menu of items offered by Elegant Edge for catering Pitt events includes breakfasts, sweets and dishes from a wide variety of cuisines, including a mezze platter of Mediterranean favorites. In their fourth year as Pittaffiliated company, Elegant Edge supplies kosher items for the Delicatessen eatery in Litchfield Towers and caters many events, since it is both kosher and halalcertified. “We’re in this to feed people and make them happy and contribute to the University and the growth of Pittsburgh,” Cowen said. Airlines aplenty were happy to detail their discounts for Pitt employees. Southwest Airlines allows two free bags per person to Pitt travelers, while United Airlines allows passengers in its Mileage Plus program to earn personal miles while flying on Pitt business. Delta’s rep, Eric Holifield, noted that “our contractors are prioritized over the general population,” so Pitt people get first dibs for help after a cancelled flight. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/suppliersshowfoodswag 1/3 "", ""Suppliers show off food, swag and more at Pitt showcase | University Times | University of Pittsburgh A plethora of printer options were on offer as well. AlphaGraphics in the Strip District featured a table covered with past Pitt printing products, from a flyer for the Graduate School of Public and Internation Affairs (GSPIA) to items for athletics and the Office of Philanthropic and Alumni Engagement. They create paper and magnetic items, from signage to direct mail; do design marketing and branding, from the spiralbound to the saddlestitched; and have hung acrylic and vinyl signs of impressive size in the Petersen Events Center. Thomas S. Barbush, sales rep from printer R.R. Donnelly’s Point Breeze plant, was proud to note that this 160yearold company once printed the Encyclopedia Britannica and Webster’s Dictionary — but more recently and locally they’ve done work for the Swanson School of Engineering, GSPIA and the schools of law, medicine and public health. “We are immediately available” for any project, he said, with the plant running 24/7. At the Reed & Witting booth, president E.J. Cyphers showed off commercial printing products including banners and note cards, plus branded products from its associated company Clayton Kendall, which can do Pitt shoes, Pitt phone cases, Pitt backpacks, Pitt suitcases, Pitt sunglasses — even a Pitt cowbell. “You can pretty much brand anything,” he said. “Anything that has a hard surface.” And it seemed as if every hotel in town was there. The boutique Tryp Hotel in Lawrenceville promoted its proximity to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and its two restaurants, one called Over Eden, which may be a play on a way to cook eggs, but definitely refers to the fact that it is on the hotel’s roof above Eden Way. The Marriott City Center, across from PPG Place downtown, hosts visiting sports teams for both Duquesne and Pitt, as well as the Pitt football team’s first and second stringers prior to home games, so they can be together for team meals and meetings, not to mention their curfew. “We’ve been very grateful to have the team,” said Brenda Porto, sales manager. “We’ve brought them good luck,” she said of this winning season. A rep from Canon, which provides copiers and printers across the University, was busy telling Pitt people about the new software coming for all Canon devices, which offers new capabilities (printing across different Pitt locations, changing print parameters, sending print jobs to colleagues and more). Pitt’s Logistics and Printing Services office was there supporting that message while also reminding staff and faculty that they still have a mailing operation and a small printing operation. That includes producing paper posters via the Copy Center, up to 42 inches wide and any length, with “near photo quality if the images are really good,” said Rob Fitzgerald, senior manager of printing services. Enterprise, the car rental company, was also on hand to remind Pitt employees of its Emerald Club loyalty program at National, a fellow Enterprise rental concern, that is for personal as well as Pitt use. The winner of most colorful booth certainly went to Pop World, maker of fruit pops, with samples of papaya, strawberry and dragon fruit on a fruitthemed table cover. You can find them at Pitt’s farmers market, see their cart or tent at other University events and get these nondairy frozen treats for your own Pitt occasion, such as this fall’s dental school welcomeback event that featured the pops. “I’m a Pitt graduate, 712 years ago,” said proprietor Amy Benedetti as more staffers with Pitt purchasing powers stopped to sample. “I’m happy to be here. I’m glad that people are learning to connect with us.” https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/suppliersshowfoodswag 2/3 "", ""Suppliers show off food, swag and more at Pitt showcase | University Times | University of Pittsburgh Marty Levine is a staff writer for the University Times.

(Shannon Wells | University Times) By SHANNON O. WELLS Writer and film director Nick Bucheit vividly recalls the moment he realized Chanell Jones was meant to play pediatric emergency physician Diana Asante in a short movie based on the true experiences of a Pitt associate professor and UPMC physician. https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittphysiciansshort 1/4 "", ""Pitt physician’s short film targets reallife racism in emergencycare setting | University Times | University of Pittsburgh “I was sitting somewhere in Lawrenceville. We had the casting (meeting), and Chanell walks in with these badass glasses, wearing scrubs,” he recalled of the Pittsburghbased actor and musician. “We had some good talent, but all of us were like, ‘Where did Chanell come from? It was pretty much a nobrainer.” For her part, Jones, after reading the script based on short stories by Sylvia OwusuAnsah, Pitt associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine and medical director of Prehospital and EMS at UPMC Children’s Hospital, immediately knew she’d found a part that was not only real, but rich with relevance about racism in the workplace. “I was so engulfed,” she said. “I was screaming from the rooftops on the inside, and I couldn’t wait, I really just couldn’t wait to let everybody understand … this really is real. This is what happens, and we’ll have some fun (doing it), but this is real, and this is what we go through. So that’s how I prepared for it: Life.” Jones and Bucheit shared their recollections at a Feb. 1 screening for “In Good Hands” — a short film about fictional Diana Asante, a pediatric emergency attending physician — in the Center for Creativity’s Understory in the Cathedral of Learning basement. The soldout event included a screening of the 11minute drama followed by a panel discussion with the creative team, led by Carl Kurlander, a Pitt film professor and founder of C4C: The Pittsburgh Lens and the Pitt in LA program. Another screening and panel discussion will take place at 7 p.m. Feb. 29 at the Understory. Kurlander recognized the dramatic potential of OwusuAnsah’s story and its factual depictions of casual racism in an emergency care setting — from patients, their parents, law enforcement officers and medical residents, among others. He encouraged Yasmine Crawley, a 2021 Pitt graduate who now works for Paramount film studios, to write and submit a script to the PITTch! 2.0 storytelling/screenplay competition. The result was the conversationalyetbracing dialogue at the heart of “In Good Hands.” Based on OwusuAnsah’s memoir, the film depicts Asante dealing with the challenges of the last patients of her shift, including a white boy who apparently has never seen a Black female doctor, and a Black teenager — facing possibly dire medical issues — who was arrested by a skeptical, unsympathetic police officer. A wideranging group of more than three dozen mentoring film professionals, Pitt students and community members took part in creating what the “In Good Hands” website describes as a “community teaching” film. OwusuAnsah said she sought to write a book dedicated to “all the little pediatric patients that have transformed my life.” “Each chapter is about a patient who impacted me in some way,” she told UPMC Health Beat last September. Also influenced by the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, she noted the shock nonBlack people expressed as further stories of racist behavior by public employees and others were shared. She knew there was a timely story to tell. “What many of us as folks of color recognize, especially after the murder of George Floyd, is that our stories have not been told often enough,” she said. “When brown people tell their stories, people will seem shocked about it, (as if) acts of racism — microaggressions like this https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/pittphysiciansshort 2/4 "", ""Pitt physician’s short film targets reallife racism in emergencycare setting | University Times | University of Pittsburgh — couldn’t be true … like, ‘You couldn’t have experienced that.’ So, I basically wanted to bring it to life.” Calling “In Good Hands” a “snippet of numerous reallife encounters,” OwusuAnsah said “everything you’ve seen here happened in real life: every interaction, every word spoken … at various stages of my medical career, and so I wanted to bring that to life, not only for me, but for the sake of my patients, for the sake of health equity, and for the sake of us just to be better human beings.” Yasmine Crawley, a former student of Kurlander’s, had put her artsandentertainment goals on hold to work on the pediatric psychiatric floor of the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center when Kurlander called. It was less than 10 days before the storytelling challenge deadline, and five days before her birthday. “He said (OwusuAnsah) has a story that she wants to write, and she needs a (screenplay) writer, and I was like, ‘Wow, OK, the deadline is coming up. But this feels like an opportunity,” she said. “So I applied.” Crawley’s script made the cut with the Center for Creativity’s selection committee, including OwusuAnsah, as well as a Hollywoodbased reader company. Crawley’s work also led to an unexpected career change after she applied to the CBS network’s highly selective page program. As fate would have it, her first meeting on rotation was with Susan Zirinsky, president of CBS See It Now Studios and former CBS News president. “The experience just went so well that we gelled. (Zirinski) was like, ‘I’m gonna hire you at the program. Are you OK with that? And I was like, ‘Absolutely.’ And that’s where I still am today,” she said of her See It Now role as an administrative assistant and production associate. OwusuAnsah called her collaboration with Crawley a natural fit. “Yasmine and I were like clockwork: ‘We’re taking this all the way to Hollywood, baby! And we’re gonna make a short film, but we’re taking it all the way.’ So we pledged to each other that we would stick together and root each other on, and it’s been that way ever since.” Going forward, OwusuAnsah and Kurlander plan to promote “In Good Hands” to film festivals and for possible development into a fulllength movie or TV series pilot. “I’ve been so blessed to have this entire team,” she said. Allegheny County Executive Sarah Innamorato, who as a District 21 state representative worked with OwusuAnsah on “Stop the Bleed” citizen emergency training efforts, attended the screening at the filmmaker’s invitation. “She is an awesome human. I wanted to come out and support her efforts,” Innamorato said after the event, calling “In Good Hands” a great opportunity to “look at the world through others’ eyes and root out the evils of racism though storytelling.” Shannon O.
