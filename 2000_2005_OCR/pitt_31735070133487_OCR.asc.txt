VOLUMJS XCVI NUMBER 85

Police name
a suspect in
kidnapping  

ERIK ARROYO
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh police have identiﬁed

the man suspected of kidnapping a_Pitt

student, robbing him of $115 and hold-
ing him captive for _more tharr-: eight
hours last Wednesday morning. , .

' Germaine Cook, a 26-year-old Hill
District resident. who goes by the name

Shawn’ Williams, and the nickname -

“Blue,” is the prime suspect, according
to police Cmdr. Dom Costa. _
Cook is believed to have abducted

‘ the 21-year-old transfer student at 1

am. Wednesday after a brief discussion
about a parking spot on Robinson

Street. He then forced the victim to

drive to several homes, convenience
stores and automated teller machines in
Westmoreland County. -
Costa said surveillance video_from
some of the bank machines helped. to
identify Cook as the prime suspect.
“The tapes helped tremendously,”
Costa said. “It confirmed every
description the young man gave about

the kidnapper, even. down to his_

clothes.”

Costa said when he compared the_
police composite sketch and the sur- A

veillance footage, the facial images
matched remarkably.

“If you look carefully at the police
sketching and the video images it’s

indisputably the same character,” he

said. “What’sluseful about the tape is-
that we can now conﬁrm where he was
and exactly what time he was there.
There’s no alibi for him anymore.”
Police issued a warrant for Cook’s
arrest on charges of kidnapping, rob-
bery and carrying a concealed weapon.
Costa warned that the suspect is still
armed and considered dangerous.
‘Cook, a black male,‘ is 5 feet 10'
inches tall, 175 pounds and has a bushy
Afro and goatee. He was last seen

(‘wearing a blue Perry Ellis- jacket and

has a diamond earring in his left ear. He
is believedto frequent the Hill District
and New Kensington areas.

Anyone with informatipn relevant ’

to‘ the case is encouraged to contact the
Pittsburgh police at (412) 422-6520.

THE PITT NEWS

Local European Union expert sees
a brightfuturerelor theeuro currency

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
Staff Writer

During World War II Alberta
Sbragia’s mother’s home in Italy was
occupied by Nazi troops. While studying
in Paris in 1968 she witnessed one of
many student revolts against the universi-
ty system.

These days many in her ﬁeld consid-
er Sbragia, a Pitt professor, one of the
world’s leading experts on the European
Union and Western European studies. She

describes her family and educational -

experiences as transfonnative and inspira-
tional.

In 1998 Sbragia helped to direct the
European Union’s spotlight of recognition
on Pitt, founding a European Union
Center on campus. The University is now
the headquarters of a number of such cen-
ters in the United States and is recognized
by the EU. '

Sbragia is Pitt’s research professor for
the University Center for International
Studies, and she also serves as the. director
of the Center for West European Studies.

This semester she is teaching a course
titled “The Politics of the European

Union.” 1   

When asked about her feelings ‘con-
cerning the. recent actions taken by the
European Union to develop a common
currency. throughout. Western Europe,
Sbragia has much to say.

“It shows that countries can transcend
their history}.-’ she said. She feels that the
creation of the euro —— thesingle currency
now in use in much of Western Europe —
is illustrative of the inﬂuence the United
States has had on Europe since World War
II.

She explained the historical transcen-
dence as proof that countries can move
beyond their political discords and work
together. In a Dec. 39, 2001 column in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette titled “The
Triumph of the euro,” Sbragia wrote that
the establishment of the euro, “signiﬁes
peace and signiﬁcant strides toward
European unity and integration.

‘The euro is a testament to the impact
of the U.S. policies toward Europe since
1945,’? she wrote, going on to credit ele-
ments of the Marshall Plan with the
rebuilding of the continent. In the article
she calls on the United States to take pride

in the inﬂuence the country has had in the A

establishment of a growing integrated
union in Europe. V

Pointing to the creation of the EU as
evidence, Sbragia said that political
change often begins there.

“Europe has always been the work-

horse of political innovation,” she said.
She explained that Europe invented the
concept of the nation-state and now it is in
the process of experimenting and develop-
ing a new political concept: a uniﬁcation
of the nation-states. , ‘

Sbragia said that historically critics
deemed European political endeavors rad-
ical. To critics in the_ United States,
Sbragia argues that in the long term the
world is better off with a strong European
Union because it creates competition and
a stronger ally.

When describing her faith in the 

and the inﬂuence the United States has
had on recent changes, she states in her
Post-Gazette column, “To those
Americans who wonder whether
American engagement with foreigners can
lead to a better world, I, holding a euro in
my hand while remembering the Nazi
occupation of my mother’s house, say,
‘You bet it can!”’ '

some options for pregnancy preven-
tion,” said Mary Barrett, a student
attending the seminar. ‘

According to Richard, condoms
are most effective when used with
another form of birthcontrol (sper-
micide, lubricants, birth-control
pills) and the only real means of
prevention from both pregnancy
and STIs. Richard also emphasized
that certain lubricants — anything
ending in “oil,” “lotion,” “Vaseline”

or “Crisco” — deteriorate latex and

reduce a condom’s efficiency. One
should use lubricants designed

‘especially for sex.

Richard also spoke brieﬂy about
female condoms. According to him,
the condoms are mo_re expensive
than their male counterpart and less
effective. Also, the condoms tend to
squeak during sex.

. Although the various methods
discussed can help defend ‘against
pregnancy and’ STIs, according to
Harley, “nothing is guaranteed.”

No need to change election cycle

How would you feel if you elected
your senator in April and he or she took
office that month, only to head home
rather than to Congress for the summer?

'That’s exactly what some members
of the Student Government Board did
this year. After being elected and taking
office in April, some promptly retumed to
their hometowns, putting a virtual freeze
on SGB, which was supposed tobe fully
functional during the summer months.

What resulted from the members’
absences — as well as a few technicali-
ties following from the change in, the
election cycle from December to April —
was a virtually lost summer and a much-
delayed fall semester. Board member
training was pushed back and ﬁve weeks
into the fall semester, committees were
not yet formed, nor were there appointed
chairs to head the committees.

Some SGB members blame last

. year’s referendum, which ‘moved the

election cycle from December to April, as
well as the Constitutional Review
Committee, the group that wrote the ref-
erendum, for SGB’s virtual loss of the

summer and slowed progress in the fall 9

semester. ‘

1 ‘Subsequently, SGB recently passed a
resolution aimed at changing the election
cycle yet again. . '

These SGB members seem to be for-

getting why the referendum was pro-

posed _ and passed with good reason.

Starting the term in the summer, when the
board would likely have more free time,
was intended to allow the members to
train for their duties and have the board
up and fully functional before the major.-
ity of students returned for the fall semes-

a ter.

_WlE:n students \ returned in late
August, they expected that SGB was
busy representing them and their interests
in their absence. The summer similarly
seemed like ample time to get organized.

While some SGB members blame
the change in the cycle for why students’
expectations were not met, SGB mem-
bers are overlooking the real reason for
their problems. Lucky for them, it’s a
problem that’s easily solved.

Certainly, no one who is hired to do a
job starting in April would only show up

- to start in August. SGB should be no dif-

ferent. If someone is elected to SGB, they
must be able to stay the summer. If this
continues to be a source of contention,
then SGB should change its by—laws to
contain this requirement. '
Most student organizations stay up
and running during the summer. Why
should SGB be different, especially con-
sidering that the University is still open
and some students remain on campus?
Changing the election cycle is not the

solution it might appear to be. Requiring _

the board members to stay for the full
length of their term is.

.the same.”_'

have unique needs and interests.
A case in point is the Citizens

Equal Rights Alliance, a Montana-.

based advocacy group that exists to
fight land claims on behalf of Native
Americans. The organization does

or interest groups.

Never quick at comebacks, I was
momentarily silenced by his
response. But it didn’t take me long
to realize that as long as there are

..problems in our society that affect

women primarily -—— such as rape and
eating disorders" —— we will need

' female groups to call_ attention to and

work to combat the gender stereo-
types and biases that create such con-
ditions. « _ ‘

But the point of having an orga-
nization or field of study devoted to a
particular group of people goes
beyond fighting injustices. For as
much as I laud diversity and believe
that everyone - can benefit from
acknowledging and celebrating our
differences, I also think it can be
important to spend time in a commu-

this under-a pretense of equality, say- VI

ing that it. must fight the land claims

Our differences define us

nity with people who share your race,
culture, religion, nationality, sexual
orientation or gender.

As a white, middle-class
Protestant American who rarely finds
herself in the position of minority, it
took traveling to India for me to real-
ize this. ' -~

Over the summer that I spent
studying in the city of Hyderabad, I
did not encounter much negative
stereotyping — at least none that I
was aware of. Most of the people I
met did not know any Americans,
and I felt ﬂattered that people were
interested in learning about my
nationality and culture.

But I did experience what it felt

like to be different because of my

skin color.'On the bus, in stores and
on campus, people stared. I could
wear a salwar kameez, henna my hair
and even speak a little Telugu, but
clearly, I would never fit in.

And so, at the end of the.day, I
was always relieved to return to the
guesthouse where the other American
students stayed. With my Indian
friends, uncovering the similarities
and differences between our coun-
tries, our cultures and ourselves was
fascinating but also exhausting.

While simply being tolerant of other
people is passive, trying to really.
understand someone from another
culture — striving to learn the hows
and whys of that person’s lifestyle —
takes a lot of work. '

It was only around the other
Americans that”I felt I could truly
relax and be myself.

That morning at 10,000 Villages,
I found myself talking to the pillow
woman while we waited in line,
Somehow we got on the subject of
India, and she told me that her hus-
band was an Indian man born in a
small town in West Bengal. She had
visited his hometown with him once.

In her marriage and her travels, I
imagined that this woman must have
encountered several similarities, but
also a number of differences and
nuances between the culture in which
her husband was raised and her own.

Isn’t that where our uniqueness
lies, in the countless and captivating
subtleties, in all the ways that we are
not alike?

Why would she want to erase all
of that by pretending we’re the same?

1 Kenneth Paul

Man was created equal, and so far
throughout this 2002 basketball season, the
same holds true for the Big East.

The redheaded stepchild of NCAA
conferences has been unpredictable, excit-
ing and self-destructive as the conference’s
14 teams head into the meat of their sched-
ules.

Competition has been stiff, upsets have
been frequent and in the end, all of the close
play will most likely lead to some deserving
teams being left out of the big dance in
March.

An impressive 12 teams have winning
records overall, with newcomers Virginia
Tech and perennial doorrnats West Virginia
keeping it  bad at the bottom of
their divisions.

The East division features Connecticut
atthetop, aspotthatisnotabnomialforthe
squad who has won all four conference
games en route to a 10-3 overall record this
season. .

UConn’s success‘ can be attributed to
sophomore Canon Butler, who has led the
team in scoring in nine of the team’s 13
games, averaging 18.9 points per game.

The Huskies have quality wins over
Miami and Vrllanova, yet the Huskies are
not ranked and to go along with the trend of
wackiness in the conference, the two teams
behind the Huskies are.

After being dropped by the Huskies and
trailing them by two games in the east,
Miami is clinging to a No. 24 ranking. The
Hurricanes won their ﬁrst 15 games of the
season but have recently began to sputter,
losing two of their last three games.

Miami will have the chance to get back
on track tonight when it hosts a Pitt team
that's coming off of an emotional home loss
to Notre Dame.

There are three teams tied with Miami
for second place in the east, including No.
22-ranked Boston College, St. John’s and

The Pitt wrestling team headed to
Hampton, VA for the Virginia Duals
Tournament ranked No. 18 in the coun-
try and still riding high on its first
sweep of Penn State since the early ‘60s
and a big victory against Slippery Rock.

The team left Hampton with a 2-2
record at the tournament, dropping its
duals record to 6-3 for the season and
possibly knocking them out of the Top
20 in the Interrnat poll.

No. 18 Pitt 27, Indiana 12

Pitt began the tournament on a pos-
itive note early on Friday, with a deci-
sive 27-12 victory over the Indiana
Hoosiers in the first round of the duals.
Pitt won seven of its 10 matches, and
ensured itself a second-round matchup
against the Golden Flashes of ’ Kent
State.

“We wrestled fairly well in the first
round, but not great,” said Pitt head
coach Rande Stottlemyer. “Indiana is a
Big 10 school, which makes them tough
regardless of their ranking. We came
out and wrestled hard and did what we
had to do.” ' '

_ Up until Saturday, the men’s swim-
ming team had never lost to West Virginia
during head coach Chuck Knoles” tenure
at Pitt That’s 11 straight meets. And with
the return of Mike Grube, the defending
Outstanding Male Swimmer in the Big
East to the perpetually formidable lineup,

it could have only made the odds for a

West Virginia win more improbable.
Make that 12 straight.
The men’s team -beat the

Mountaineers 163-78, setting four WVU
Natatoriurn records along the way. The
women’s team had an easy time with the
Mountaineers as well, winning 173-68.

“I don’t really think about it,” said
Knoles of his streak versus WVU. “We’re
a better team than them.”

Those aren’t brash words after more
than a decade of dominance. WVU only
won two events this time around.

Grube — out of action all fall semes-
ter after having knee surgery — jumped
right back into the fray with the 100-yard

freestyle ‘andpswam the fastest ever in the
W V U pool, with a time of 45.23 seconds.

Knoles said he had “a little bit of trep- —

idation” concerning Grube’s ﬁrst competi-
tion this season, but “he’s such a phenom-
enal athlete. He wasn’t worried from what
I could tell.” - i ’

No jitters in the 400 medley relay,
either. Along with ~ Ken Shelhorse,
Raymond Brush and Miah Heath, Grube
anchored, and the relay team won with a
time of 3:26.72. Grube also ﬁnished sec-
ond in the 200 free.

"Shelhorse led off the relay with the

100 backstroke, and his split of 25.38 was
a new pool record. Shelhorse alsostamped
his name in the record books in the 200
backstroke winning with a time of 1:50.98.

The last record to fall came courtesy

of Brush in the 200 IM (1 :53.78), who beat -

his closest competitor by three seconds.
Three long events translated to three
wins for Erriily Colley, one of the many
outstanding performers for the women.
Colley started off with the 1,000 free
(1022419), followed that up with the 200
butterﬂy (2208.99) and still had enough

Pitt swimmers dunk Mountaineers

left in the tank to win the 500 free
(5:04.00).

“Emily’s forte is the distance events,”
women’s head coach Marian. Cassidy-
Keen said. ' ' .

“Depending on where we need peo-
ple, they’re going to get to swim,”
Cassidy-Keen said. _

I Also for the women, the 400 medley
“C” team beat the “A” team, and both beat

the WVU “A” team. VVith the women’s _

win in the 400 freestyle relay, Pitt swept
the relay events.

, Lacey I-Ilavka won the 200 free,
Carolyne Savini the ‘200 IlVI and Jen
O’Brien the three-meter diving board,
among others. »

For the men, diver Mike Wells swept
both the one- and three-meter heights. Eric
Liinkemann won the 500 free. Heath won
the 50 free. " _

The men’s record now stands at 4-0
overall and 3-0 in the Big East. The
women are 3-3 with a 1-0 record in the
conference. Next up for both is a two-day
tn’-meet at Trees Pool against‘Mary1and

‘ and Villanova on Friday and Saturday. ‘

Baseball and Gymnastics sign
recruits for 2003 campaigns

KENNETH PAUL V

Sports Editor

Pitt head baseball coach Joe Jordano has signed seven recruits
to national letters of intent for the 2003 baseball season.

The seven recruits breakdown to

A . threepitchers, oneoutﬁelder, two inﬁeld-
, ers and a catcher.

Brian Bircher, a left-handed pitcher,
is one of three transfers from Louisburg
College in North Carolina. As Bircher
helped his team to a 47-10 record, he held
opposing batters to a .159 bating average.

Two right handers, Derek Blyzwick

’ and Nick Evangelista, will also join the Panthers. Evangelista also
played ball with Louisburg, where he posted a 3.81 ERA and a 5-
3 record last season. Blyzwickis a local talent, from Moon Area
High Schoo1.vBlyzwick had a 2.00 ERA for the Tigers, who won
their first Pennsylvania State Title in baseball. »

He was also named all-conference and chosen as one of the
Fabulous 22 in Western Pemrsylvania as a quarterback. »

The third transfer from Louisburg is inﬁelder ‘Mike Scanzano,
who batted .288 last season. Another inﬁelder, Torn Cashman,
played last season at Erie Community College, where he batted

\

.425.

Rounding out the signees is catcher Alex Rybczak and out-

      
 

    - 
 3 ..

 

ﬁelder Ben Copeland, who led Bradford high school to an 18-3
record, a school best.

The Panthers open up the season with a doubleheader at
Maryland-Eastem Shore.

° Gymnastics head coach Debbie Yohman has
signed three recruits of her own for the 2003 sea-
SO11;

. Joining the Panthers will be Eileen Carry,
Lindsay Swan and Roslyn Singleton. '

Carry, who-performed for the same club team as
current Panther ﬁteshman "Sarah Gibson, is an all-
arounder for the Jersey Northstars. She was a
Level 10 state all-around champion in 1999-2000.

Swan is also a Level 10 competitor as well as a gymnast for
West Islip High School in New York.

, Singleton selected Pitt over Western Michigan and Towson
andccomes to the Panthers front the Berks Gymnastics Club, the
same club as sophomore Marcy Blitz. '

The Panthers next meet is at West Virginia this Saturday, with
their next home meet against Penn State on Jan. 27.

Panthers shocked byKent State

Split, page ,8

in the l65—pound division at the 1:42
mark, and Jacob Lininger won an injury
default victory in the heavyweight divi-
sion to earn the Panthers six ‘bonus
points and solidify the win.

Kent State 19, No. 18 Pitt 13

Pitt carried the momentum of the
Indiana victory into its match against
unranked Kent State, winning three of
the first four falls as Mike May scored a
6-3 win over Kent State’s Jared Opfer
in the 125-pound division, followed by
close victories for Amistade and
Giovinco, respectively. ‘

But Kent State came back to win
four matches in a row, and a late 11-3
major decision victory for Sandberg

‘ wasn’t enough to prevent a shocking

19-13 Kent State win.
“We kind of stubbed our toe against
Kent State. We had a chance to win that

i one and let it slip through our ﬁngers. It
was quite a disappointing loss,”.

Stottlemyer said.

No. 18 Pitt 30, Virginia Tech 13

As Saturday began, Pitt was deter-
mined to avoid another disappointing
loss as they faced Eastern Wrestling
League Conference opponent Virginia
"Tech. The Panthers responded by crush-

- ing the Hokies 30-13.

A “We came back from the loss and

knocked them around a 9 little,’’
Stottlemyer said. “As a coach, you
always like to see that kind of
resilience.”

Once again, May gave the Panthers
a spark by winning a 10-2 major deci-

.sion over Geoff Head. Giovinco contin-

ued the trend with a 10-2 major deci-

sion of his own against Virginia Tech’s '

Reed Carpenter. J ' ~

Matt Catullo grabbed his first victo-
ry of the day, with a 16-5 major deci-
sion over Thomas Ovalle. Rounding out
the victors for the Panthers were

Fronhofer (forfeit), Doll (7-1), and.

Lininger (pin fall at 1:57).

No. 19 Wisconsin 24, No. 18 Pitt _18
Pitt ended the Virginia Duals on
Saturday afternoon -against what would
prove to beits toughest opponent of the
weekend, the No. 19—ranked Wisconsin
Badgers. ' '
Although the Panthers wrestled
hard and won ﬁve matches, they came
up short as the Badgers walked away
with a 24-18 victory.
Amistade won a forfeit victoryfor
the Panthers, and Giovinco posted a 5-0
shutout victory against Tyler Laudon to
ﬁnish the tournament undefeated.
Fronhofer got down early by a
score" of 5-0, only to come back and
defeat Ryan Lewis 10-7. Sandberg won
a 5-4 victory over J areck Horton to

complete a perfect record for the tour—;

nament, and Lininger added 6-4 win
against Dave Neumyer. »
Despite the defeat, Stottlemyer was

happy with the team’s performance _

against the Badgers.
“We lost a tough one, but I thought

, that from top to bottom that was‘ a real-

ly well-wrestled match.”

Although the team ﬁnished with a
2-2 record, Stottlemyer was pleased
with several of the teatn’s individual
performances.

“Jake Lininger did a really good
job, and Giovinco made some real
strides this weekend,” Stottlemyer said.
“I was really pleased with his perfor-
mance. Coming off of a shoulder injury,
you want to see a guy get plenty of mat
time to get back into a rhythm, and he
really delivered this weekend.”

The Panthers travel to Cleveland
State on Thursday, before returning to
Fitzgerald Field House this weekend for
a quad meet. Stottlemyer remains opti-

mistic, and says that the following

stretch of meets will be crucial in deter-
mining the success of the 2001-02 sea-
son.
“Our goal is to win an EWL title,

V and although we always do well, we’ve

come up a little short the last few
years,” he said. “Our wins against Penn

‘ State and Slippery Rock were huge, and

we’ve got some important conference
games down the road that we feel that
we can win.”

Big East as
unpredictable
as ever

Column, page 8

Villanova.

Boston College had been ranked as
high as No. 12 before getting knocked oﬁ at
home by Pitt. Things got even worse for
them over the weekend as they were totally
dismantled by Georgetown, 70-43.

For Boston College to regain its form, it
has to take some pressure off of guard Troy
Bell, in the fonn of scoring by players such
as Kenny Walls and Ryan Sidney.

After Pitt defeated Boston College, it'-

tiaveled to Rutgers and fought off an 18-0
rtm to secure the road win, which catapulted
the team into the top 25. Four days later
another Big East foe, Notre Dame, stole
Pitt’s thunder.

While Pitt and Notre Dame have made
some noise, the team to beat in the west is
Syracuse, the highest-ranking Big East
bunch, at No. 8.

Forward Preston Shumpert leads the
Orangemen. Shumpert, who,doesn’t see too
many shots that are not to his liking, is aver-
aging 21.7 points per game. Joining him is
fellow gunner, DeShaun Williams (19.1
points per game) and the athletic Keith
Duany (14.6 ppg).

Syracuse’s schedule gets stiff quickly as
it had a tough time beating Notre Dame last
night and has dates at Tennessee and Pitt
within the next week, which will show just
how good the Orangemen really are.

The critics can say what they want
about the conference but seven weeks from
now, it would not shock me to see six or
seven teams make it to the big dance.

Villanova started out slow but is now 9-

94. ‘Nova has claimed a victory at the

expense of Notre Dame on the road and if
Gary Buchanan and Ricky Wright can play
consistently, ﬂie Wildcats have a chance.
Georgetown was ranked in the top 20
earlier in the season but a tough schedule has
knocked them out. Nevertheless,‘ playing a
difﬁcult schedule might help the team come
March. The Hoyas have losses at No. 9-
ranked UCLA and No. 20-ranked Georgia

and a loss " at ‘home to No. 10-ranked .

Virginia.

Georgetown faces Syracuse and Pitt
twice over its next ﬁve games. '

While there’s a limit to the number of
tearnsthatcanmakeittotheNCAA
Tournament, teams like Seton Hall, Rutgers
and St. John’s all have a shot to make the
National Invitational Tournament.

With all of the battles that have taken
place already, the Big East proves that you
don’t need March to have a little madness.
