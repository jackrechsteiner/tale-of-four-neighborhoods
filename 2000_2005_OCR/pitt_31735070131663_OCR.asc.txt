ew system worries engineers

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s iengineers used to be respon-
sible for a few buildings.

— But for the past few months, each
engineer has been responsible for half
of Pitt’s campus, and some engineers
believe the new system will cause more
problems. ‘ V ' ‘

In March, thevengineering system
‘was changed, dividing the campus in
half along Fifth Avenue and assigning
-engineers to be cover all the buildings
within their half of the campus.

The engineers are also now divided
into two groups —— preventative and
reactive —— those who repair buildings
before problems arise, and those who
respond to problems, respectively;

“Until recently, the operating engi-
n'eers wereistationed at specific build-
ings, leaving a majority of buildings
untended and causing workload dispar-
ities,” Ana Guzman, associate vice
chancellor for Facilities Management,
said in her comments announcing the
change. i A '-

But the building engineers were not
asked for‘ input. before the changes
were made, six Pitt building engineers
said‘. ‘Instead, they were presented with
anew systemand: told to make it work.
The engineerssaid Guzman and others
involved‘ with the decision to change
systems, might , not totally, understand

the role of an engineer on campus.
Although the engineers requested
that their names be withheld for the
safety of their jobs," their union, the
International Union of Engineers, local
95, voted unanimously for the group to
speak to the Pitt News on behalf of the
bargaining unit at Pitt. ‘ .
The engineers did not oppose
change, they said, but they opposed the

It takes at least one
‘year to know a
building, accordingto
the engineers.

lack of training for the new jobs they,

were given, and they felt Guzman mis-
represented them. .

Guzman and the Office of Facilities
Management refused to comment in
responseto the engineers’ statements."

Before the system changed on
March 10,; the engineers were dedicat-
ed,—._or assigned specifically -— to the
building in which they worked, while
they maintainedthe mobility: to help in

surrounding buildings when the engi-
neers in those buildings were unavail-
able. In each building cluster, engi-
neers had experience in up to five
buildings. 4

, Now, each engineer must be
accountable for as many as 20 build-
ings, they said. _ .

It takes at least one year to know a
building, according to the engineers.

Guzman also said in her speech that
she expects to see a ‘V“noticeable
improvement in the way the building
systems operate, because there will be
a lot more attention to preventative
maintenance, instead of waiting for
things to malfunction and fixing them.”

Tom 'I‘yghe, the ‘executive assistant
to the general president for the
International Union ‘of Operating
Engineers, said therewere “a lot of
issues” that would make a dedicated
engineer, like in the old system, more
desirable than a rotating one, like in the
new system.

When an engineer works in one
building, he or she gets to know it
“intimately” and can become more
comfortable in it, assuring the safety
that comes from knowledgeable engi-
neers, Tyghe said. I

“If you have a proven success ——
and the University of Pittsburgh does

’ '-—- you don’t normally change,” said

Pennsylvania takes trash, Pittsburgh turns it to gold

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

From the computer labs and cafeterias to the ﬂy-
ers and pamphlets scattered across campus, we
accumulate a‘ lot of trash.

But while most students put a lot of energy into
generating trash, whether by eating lunch or publi-
cizing an event, few seem to worry about where the
trash goes.

“I know we have recycling bins around campus,
but they don’t always get used properly,” junior
Jared Mitchell said. “How do we even know that the
stuff in those bins is getting recycled?”

A recycling collection company called Unipaper
collects recyclables on Pitt’s campus on a weekly
basis. The recyclables include bottles, cans, plastic,
aluminum and clear glass. According to Mike
Brennan, recycling coordinator for Pitt, Pitt recycles
about 360 tons of paper and more than 180 tons of
cardboard a year. .

Pitt also recycles an average 40,000 pounds of
steel a year, according to Brennan’s records.

The money raised from trash dumped into the
recycling bins around campus is donated to Habitat
for Humanity, according to Brennan.

The city of Pittsburgh works with the surround-
ing areas to encourage recycling by placing bottle-
shaped bins around heavily trafficked corners in
individual communities, such as the business dis-

tricts of Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Bloomfield and
Polish Hill.

“This started a few years back and we have seen
rather positive results from the idea,” said Sharon
Svitek, the recycling coordinator at the Department
of Environmental Protection in Pittsburgh.

‘Many business owners in various parts of the
city are happy with the efforts to help keep
Pittsburgh beautiful.

_“It’s nice to see that our taxes are being used for
something good,” said Marta Ferra, a longtime
worker at Cappy’s Cafe on Walnut Street in
Shadyside. “Recycling is so easy, but not enough
people take the time to walk five extra steps to a
recycling bin and throw a can in there, as opposed to
a trash can or the side of the street.”

Despite the _city’s efforts to control trash gener-
ated by Pittsburgh’s residents, Pennsylvania remains
a receptacle for out—of-state trash haulers, who
transport other states’ garbage into Pennsylvania.

DEP representatives say they have tried to keep
out—of-state trash that is dumped hereto a minimum,
but they did not have much success until recently.

“There was no real reason for it. I guess it was
just easier to dump off in Pennsylvania because of
all the open terrain, as opposed to somewhere else

along the coast,”’said Mike Forbeck, permit issuer ‘

for the DEP.
In 2002, out—of-state trash haulers dumped 11.7
million tons of trash into Pennsylvania, which is

less than the 12.6 million tons of waste dumped in
2001. It was the first time in 11 years that the
amount of out—of-state trash dumped. into
Pennsylvania was less than the previous year,
according to the DEP.

Democrats in Pennsylvania’s House of
Representatives established a bill in 2000 requiring
“landfill owners seeking to build or expand landfills
to provide clear and compelling reasons for their
request, as well as address the environmental and
health concerns of residents.” ‘

Last year, a $4 fee was added to the waste-
dumping fee, according to Brennan. This brings the
cost to $7.25 per ton of waste dumped into
Pennsylvania, more than doubling the cost of the
year before. A

Newly placed restrictions on incoming out—of-
state trash include stricter policies on landfills, new

permit laws, more crackdowns on, safety, environ- .

mental checkpoints and the prevention of trucks car-
rying illegal chemical, radiological or biological
hazards coming into Pennsylvania.

Trash haulers must also wear a vehicle registra-
tion sticker stating that the vehicle was cleared
ahead of time and is permitted to carry waste into
Pennsylvania. _ V

“These laws make it less enticing for out—of-
state trash to come into Pennsylvania, with higher
restrictions and tighter security measures,” Svitek-
said. ~

THE PITT NEWS

Board member surprised by
response, praises University,
chancellor for diversity effort

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

' When Catherine DeAngelis
pointed out the lack of women
among new executive board mem-
bers at Pitt’s summer board of
trustees meeting last month, she
didn’t realize she’d make the front
page of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
the next day. '

“I amshocked at the reaction to
what I thought was only an observa-
tion,” said DeAngelis, the editor of
the Journal of the American
Medical Association and a board
member since 2002. “My comment
was made as an observation that I
hoped would raise awareness that
we need more women in leadership

are into both the University and
higher education in general,” said
Rose, who is a member of the law
firm of Cohen and Grigsby.

Although it might seem that
CEOs are disproportionately repre-
sented among board members, Rose
pointed out that the board includes
several political leaders, doctors,
insurance professionals and the
president of Perdue University ~—— a
Pitt graduate.

A variety in backgrounds bene-
fits the board, because each mem-
ber is required to serve on at least
two ‘committees, chosen based on
the members’ occupation and abili-
ties. '

“It takes a lot of time and com-
mitment,” Rose said, adding that he

first joined the

positions.”
DeAngelis
said she was

proud of her first
year on the
board, describing
it as very enjoy-
able and produc-
tive, and praising
the current board

A board that relies

“It’s very grati-

D e A n g e l i s _
added, saying a board that relies

intelligence.”

While DeAngelis’ comment
might have drawn more attention
than she planned, it also brought to
light a diversity-driven selection
process that Nominating Committee
Chairman Evans Rose said was
already in place. '

“One of our prime criteria is
that we want a diversity of races
and genders,” Rose said. “We also
want a diversity of backgrounds.”

While board members look to
recruit community leaders, Rose
said they try to find people from
different areas of expertise — such
as architects, engineers and public
figures —— who have the useful abil-
ity to take pressure from the public.

“We’re looking for people who
are smart and wise, and people who

Expressing
regret that more attention did not go
to the positive presentations at the
board meeting, which included a
review of many new or improved
facilities at Pitt, DeAngelis praised
the University and its leadership.

“His job is impossible, and he
does it so well,” DeAngelis said of

Nordenberg, adding that students

only "have to worry about taking
care of themselves while the
Chancellor is held responsible for
taking care of everyone.

. “He’s onconstant call; he has to
make extremely difficult
sions,” DeAngelis said. ‘-‘He can
sometimes please maybe 90 per-
cent, but he’s only going to hear
from the other 10 percent.”

“The University is a phenome-
nal place —— believe me, I do not
have [spare] time,” DeAngelis said.
“I made time [to serve on the board]
because I think Pitt deserves it.”

building was ever untended, even

Pitt’s engineers pointed out in the

pen, one of the
engineers said. _

Before most people were in class
or at work, the dedicated engineers
had already checked the critical
areas of their buildings and taken
‘care of many of the complaints they
received, leaving time later in the
morning for preventative care, they
said.

With the new system, the engi-
neers are unable to take time daily to
check the critical areas. 4 1

‘_‘We’re not complaining. We’re
not bitter engineers,” one said. “We
just want [our buildings] to work
right.”

Working in the same’ building
every day allowed the engineers to
know the building’s tenants, who
consequently knew who togo to with
their problems, the engineers added.

The "engineers also expressed
concern about the division of build-
ing engineers into ,. two different
types, which they said could cause
problems if only preventative engi-

neers are available when someone .

reports a problem that demands a
reactive engineer,.such as an elevator
entrapment or the sounding of a fire
alarm. A  :
Since Pitt is a major research
university, homeland security is
important as well, they said. If there
is a chemical problem in oneof the
research labs, an engineer who is
unfamiliar with the building is less

The zones are

divided into areas

based upon the workload in each
area. .

Jack Baker, Mary1and’s director

.of operations and maintenance, said

their system is “very similar” to
Pitt’s new system. The number of
buildings the engineers are responsi-
ble for depends on the buildings;

zones with research facilities have _

fewer buildings than zones with
classroom buildings, for example,

He added that the system has
been in place for at least 15' years,
and engineers with more experience
in an area can be taken along with
engineers less familiar with a build-
ing. ‘

The Pitt engineers said Pitt’s sit-A

uation is not entirely the same,
explaining that differences arise

because PSU is in a rural‘ area while ,

Pitt is in an urban one.
Ultimately, engineers say they

are unhappy because, if the new sys- .

tem fails, they do not want to be
responsible for harm to anything or
anyone. '

“It’s [Facilities Management’s]

right to manage, and We’re going‘ to
do what they tell us to do,” Bill
Cagney, the business manager for the
local chapter of the union, said.
He added that the engineers wanted
Pitt’s leaders and community mem-
bers to be aware of the changes and
potential problems.

New drunk-driving standards good for Pa.

On Monday, the Pennsylvania
State House passed a bill making the
roads safe, aiding crime prevention
and keeping innocent bystanders pro-
tected. ,

If the Senate passes this bill, and if
Rendell approves it, it will allow
Pennsylvania to collect $3 million as a
signing bonus from the federal ‘govern-
ment for pushing the legislation
through before the Oct. 1 deadline.

This bill lowers the blood alcohol
content limit that people can have, and
still legally operate a motor vehicle,
from .1 to .08.

Roughly translated, a 170—pound
man would reach a .08 BAC after hav-
ing four alcoholic beverages in an
hour; a l37—pound woman would need
only three. 7

If that 170-pound man had four
J agerineister shots or Yuenglings in an
hour, and then decided to take a drive,
he could now be prosecuted and face

up to a $300 ﬁne and six months in jail. [

In this situation, he is a danger to

himself and others. There is no excuse '

for getting'in a car mildly sloshed. And
four drinks in an hour are enough to

impair’ judgment and ‘~.IIlOtO1‘ coordina- I

tion.

Lowering these standards comes at
the federal government’s behest.
‘Pennsylvania either had to comply or
face losing $12 million in federal high-
way funding. "

/*

4’.

Given the Bush adn1inistration’s
other up—in-smoke attempts at crime
prevention — cough, Operation Pipe
Dreams, cough — this one seems
grounded in practicality. Cheers to the
federal government for putting its dol-

lars where its sense is, namely into.

programs that would actually work.

Given Billy Gaines’s tragic death,
after falling 25 feet with a BAC of .16,
Pitt students should rally behind these
regulations and acknowledge the dan-
gers of not monitoring alcohol con-
sumption and behavior while under the
inﬂuence. ‘ ' I

In addition to lowering the overall
BAC limit for driving, this bill sets up
a system for prosecuting drunk drivers.

Those with‘ a BAC from .08 to .099
would fall under “general impair-
ment;” .1 to .15 would be “high rate;”
and more than .16 is “highest rate,”
according to a July‘ '8 Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette article.

Drunk driving is not a. victinrless
crime. Driving under the inﬂuence is
dangerous,‘ not only to the person
doing it, but also to ‘anyone else he or
she might encounter.

A People are injured ’or killed by
drunk drivers each day. According to
the Center for Alcohol Studies, alcohol
plays a role in 40 percent of lethal
crashes. The state Senate should pass
these, posthaste and make the state a
safer place to live.

Ask E lonely:= one night solo ain’t S; bad

Recently, my second favorite band,
STYX — along with REO Speedwagon
and Journey — graced ﬂie Igloo with the
timeless sounds of classic rock

I was there — alone. For months, I had A

asked, coaxed and, as the day of the concert
approached, begged my friends to go with
me. But no one would. Even those that had
legitimate excuses — like work — went out

of their way to tell me they wouldn’t go even

if they could.  rejection of
my taste in music, though
entirely predictable, stillsumg.
When I arrived at the arena,
I felt out of place immediately.
Everyone was with at least one
other person. Walking up to the
ticket window and asking for
“one” was really awkward.
What would the box-office

friends? . g

I got my ticket — tenth row, center —
and wandered into the arena, keeping myself
occupied by counting the nmnber of mullets
I saw. Still, this uniquely Pittsburgh 
couldn’t effectively distract me from think-
ing about being alone.

Fortunately, STYX did --— for an hour
or more. Then the set change came, and my
feelings of loneliness returned, stronger than
before. Being a 21-year-old guy, alone at

' what others saw as a bad concert, which was
largely full of rniddle—aged couples, was too _

much. -
My friends told me that I should have
been looking for that elusive “Penny on the
Floor’ ’ at a Clarks concert that night. If I fol-
lowed social norms, I would have been at a
bar, a club, a baseball game or even playing
video games by myself —— anywhere but at
that concert.

Resolving my intemal conﬂict was
even more urgent than the pressing question
of who — REO or Journey — would play
next

  

Jason Lawrence
For-The Pitt News

I thought about the things I’ve done and
enjoyed in my three years in Pittsburgh.
While a lot of them.— a majority of them —
involved friends, a noticeable number didn’t.

For example, Labor Day my sopho-
more year, I went to PNC Park to see the
Brewers take on the Pirates — both having
been mathematically eliminated from the
playolfs — in a meaningless doubleheader.

Not only was it a beautiful night, but
- ' also, by the start of the game,
I was sitting in the second row
i— one lesson I learned is that,
when you’re alone, it’s easy to
buy or steal a good seat —
and it didn’t matter if there
was anyone next to me.

I see hockey games, go to
concerts and, most days, as
the Eagles sang, eat my lunch
all by myself.

I justiﬁed doing these
things alone, and resolved my

insecurities, by acknowledging my strong
independent streak I place a great value on
the tastes, interests, values and everything
else that comprise my identity. Above all, I
value maintaining the integrity of that identi-
ty, which requires acting independently —
and ignoring your friends’ ignorance of clas-
sic rock Once I convinced myself of that,
my attention turned back to the stage to ﬁnd
REO playing. I sat back, continued counting
mullets and settled in to enjoy the rest of a
great concert. Even if none of my friends
wanted to go with me, that shouldn’t stop me
from enjoying the show —— or subjecting
them to every detail in recounting it

As I left the arena, all I could think about
was that I almost. let my ﬁiends come

between me and a great concert.

Jason also left with an autographed copy of
STYXis newest album, “Cyclorama, ”
released this year He urges you to check it
out and to e-mail him with your thoughts at

Teen-age violence inspires impotent, self—righteous blame

Early Sunday morning, on a quiet street in Oaldyn, N .J .,
a suburb of Philadelphia, police arrested 18-year-old Matthew
Lovett and two juvenile accomplices after they attempted to
carjack a passing motorist. Lovett and the two teens surren-
dered to police despite holding an intimidating arsenal of
machetes, riﬂes, shotguns and some 2,000 rounds of amrnuni—
tron.

Their alleged plan consisted of killing three speciﬁc
individuals, then driving around.»the town,‘murderi’ng at
random. They “plarmed on not being taken alive,”
according to the Oaklyn Police Chief, Christopher
Ferrari, quoted in AP reports. Lovett, the leader, is said
to have dressed in black, emulating the characters from
The Matrix, and called himself the One. The three, avid
role-players, called themselves The Warriors of
Freedom, and, according to WPVI-TV, Lovett consid-
ered himself a warrior ﬁghting for “mankind’s freedom.
Freedom from this society  you best be grateful, my
original plan was to kill you all.”

I’m going to be risky here-, putting on my prophecy cap.
I feel conﬁdent in predicting a modest-to—large swelling of
outrage at the “senseless brutality” of such a plan, followed by
much hand—wringing and renewed interest in posting the Ten
Commandments in schools, just as happened after the
Columbine tragedy. .

And I’ll even predict that, in the long run, there
won’t be much done to help these kids or others like
them; the district attorney, smelling blood in the water, is
already promising to try them as adults.

This is the kind of story that has all the right ingre-
dients for righteous, impotent indignation on the parts of
all the people whose job it is to, well, be outraged by
things, then offer some simple answers and go back to
sleep until the next shocker comes along.

The seeds are already planted. The New York Post, _

that bastion of good taste and reasoned argument, head-
lined the story “‘Matrix’ Freak In Massacre Plot.”

I assume the irony was unintentional. Choosing the
word “freak” for an article about a teenager so mocked
by his peers that he wanted to kill them is either deli-
ciously self—aware media satire or incredibly poor taste,
pandering to an audience seeking"tit:illation rather than
information or understanding. A

I think we can guess which way that one’s going to
fall.

More interesting, though, is the Matrix
angle. Virtually every article mentions
Lovett’s fascination with the movie, often in
the ﬁrst paragraph. Here begins the process‘
of Naming the Demon ——- putting a conve-
nient face on inconvenient facts. When
things get weird or complex, trot out one
bogeyman or another. This time, it’ 11 be vio-
lent, neo-mystical movies that, while posing
some interesting Philosophy 101 questions,

  

Jesse Hicks
For The Pitt News

Yes, it’s in that matrix that we pay millions of dol-
lars to watch leather-clad rebels ﬁght for our freedom
from virtual reality. And it’s there when the fortress of

the brave needs a $400 billion military budget and still \

doesn’t feel safe.

Novelist Robert Anton Wilson is fond of reminding
us that this is still The Planet of the Apes. For all our
claims of evolution, we still subconsciously harbor the
worst of primate ideals: that violence is power. We sel-
 dom acknowledge it, yet we cheer the cow-

boy, the desperado, the wronged man who
kills for vengeance or the president who
' kills to make us feel safe.

Our society is awash in violence not
because of some monolithic media pushing
lurid, gory tales on us, or because we don’t
know right from wrong, or because we own
too many guns. Those are all secondary
causes. The real problem is, at root, our
belief in the power of violence. We don’t

ultimately devolve into grm-pom.

Remember how Morpheus says, if you
die in the Matrix, you die in the real world? And then
Neo goes and shoots up about a million of the people
he’s supposed to be saving? No wonder Lovett original-
ly thought he’d be saving mankind by killing us all.
Man, that’s like thinking that you’ll save a village by
destroying it‘or liberate a people by bombing them.

Of course, .Lovett wasn’t only seduced‘ by the
Matrix’s self—contradictory morality. He was misled by a
different kind of matrix, one that you can’t see or touch
or buy-at Blockbuster in special edition surround sound,
but that is all around you-. It’s there when a bully smacks
around the kid with the limp, and everyone "shrugs it off
as part of growing up.’ .

need movies to deify violence; that’s
already in our nature.  .

For Lovett, murder was the way to make the fear
stop. Ifhe could kill, he wouldn’t be powerless anymore.

He wouldn’t have to be afraid. Bullets would solve his

problems. .

That he knew this was wrong is evidenced by his
peaceful surrender. Somewhere inside, the civilized part
of the ape triumphed, and Lovett realized that “do unto
othersbefore they do unto you” could not make him any
safer or less afraid. The question is, have we?

Jesse Hicks thinks maybe video games and the Internet»

aren’t always to blame. He is part of the Internet at

score, from accident, starvation or disease.
In his endeavor to build an empire from the
Cape (of Good Hope, at the tip of what is
now South Aﬁica) to Cairo, Rhodes was
responsible for the deaths of thousands, if
not more. 

Being from Tanzania, and keenly
interested in African politics, Mr. Ismail
loathed Rhodes. Consequently, he instruct-
ed his students never to accept Rhodes
scholarships, saying that the money was
tainted by history and blood.

‘direct line can be drawn from Rhodes to
the persistent racial, ethnic and socioeco-
nomic conﬂicts in southern Africa:

Others might see what Rhodes did as
part of a series of events that plagued that
region. of Africa. These ' began with the
Arabic slave trade — which persisted for
centuries and resulted in the abduction of

i more Africans than its European counter-
part — and persist with the frequent civil
conﬂicts and, unrest seen in Zimbabwe,
formerly Rhodesia

-‘Either’ perspective‘ shows that what.

Rhodes did requires some sort of repara-
tions, because he wasthe partial— if not
direct — cause of the current situation.

The word “reparations” -—- compensa-
tion for past wrongs — has become con-
troversial, especially when associated with
paying black Amerier’n‘fs’ for ﬂietslavery of
their ancestors. Even reparations from the
German government to Holocaust sur-
vivors drew ﬁre because some saw it as a
means of buying forgiveness.

These reparations on the part of the

Rhodes Trust, which, in The Times,-the
foundation director calls “closing a circle”

' since “payback is too harsh a word,” are an

attempt to i acknowledgezw  mend
Rhodes’ atrocities. ‘ ' A '  I  '

by Rhodes are dead, the diamondtrade that
he controlled, with his shares in the de

Rather than opening wounds already

half-healed, asmany accuse reparations for ‘

American slavery of doing, this foundation
is solving current problems by frmding
education. '

Moreover, this oﬂicially ends the quiet

acceptance of Rhodes as a benefactor and
brings his inhumane means of empire
building to the forefront.

Can Rhodes’ reputation as a proﬁteer
and racist be exonerated through this foun-
dation? Probably not. No matter how many

Rhodes scholarships. He believed that we_
must be taught history as it truly occurred," C’

rather than some whitewashed version
about grand, if delusional, empires.

‘ Is Rhodes’ money still tainted? Are
these $1.6 million installments merely

"returning what is owed to southern Africa?

I cannot answer these questions, and I am
loath to believe anyone can completely.
But the foundation is a start, an
acknowledgement that history still begs for
resolution and, at times, receives it.

P Clothes encounter with Eve 6  

KATIE MAVRICH
A&E Editor

‘ The members of Eve 6 were only teen-agers when
their self—titled debut album burst onto the scene in
1998. Five years later, the boys have grown into men.
They played a sold-out show at Rosebud last
Wednesday and were also on this year’s X-Fest bill.
The Pitt News got a chance to sit down with lead

singer- Max Collins before the Rosebud show to talk’

about growing up, nudity and the band’s latest album,
It’s All in Your Head, which hits stores July 22.

The Pitt News: You guys said you want a “new begin-
ning.” But there was an article on MTV.com where
they interviewed you. There were a lot of comparisons
of songs from previous albums to those on It’s All in
Your Head. For example, they compare “Here’s to the
Night” to “Girlfriend.” What do you thinkabout that?

Max Collins: I wrote the beginnings of “Girlfriend,”
before “Here’s to the Night” even came out as

a single; it’s one of the older songs that was
written for this record. I think we felt like we
were going into it differently this time, with
more of a solid idea with complete songs. On
Horrorscope, We kind of went in with bits and
pieces of stuff. It was new in that way, in that P
we took time off to really solidify.all the mate.
rial before we went into the studio.

TPN: So would you say that before the
recording process was kind of hasty in a way?

MC: No, no. We did our first record, and those
are just songs that I’d been writing since 10th
grade. There’s no deadline on that, you just
write songs and you play before you even
think of recording a record. ,And then __you
make the record, and it comes out, and you’re
on tour for a year and a half, and then you get
right off the road into the studio with bits and
pieces of stuff. “Promise” was actually the
oldest song, and that was written before we
went out on the road. But the other stuff was
just bits and pieces of songsthat I’d written on
the road. So with this one we took time off, I,
mean, I say “time off,” but we were definitely
writing and demo-ing.’ We weren’t‘ in the stu-
dio or on the road. And we had time to reﬂect
and realize where we were and look at the past
couple years for the first time. And that’s
where these songs came from.

TPN: You said that, since you were all scared
about not being kids anymore, not living on a
tour «bus or in your parents’ homes, and being
on your own in the real world, you took. the
fear and put it intothis record. Can you explain
that? A

nitely one of those transitional periods where you’re
not a teen—ager and you’re trying as hard as hell not to
become an adult, you‘ know? In another way, you are
being forced into responsibility, and I’m sure that
impacted thelrecord. That’s just kind of what we were
going through at the time, and struggling with identity.

TPN: You guys have been doing a lot of festivals: X
103.9 ‘Mayfest The Motherload, The Earth Day
Festival, and locally, X-Fest. Do you prefer doing big
festivals like that or playing in smaller clubs?

MC: I deﬁnitely prefer playing clubs. Festivals are
good in that it’s really cool to play for a lot of people,
but it’s the closer connection that’s more satisfying.
You feel like everybody is participating for onething
and it’s really cool. That’s what you get in the clubs.

TPN: Speaking of X-Fest, I hear the reason that you
got naked when you were here for that on Memorial
Day was that you guys were a little bit ‘bored in Moon
Township. Tonight you are performing in Pittsburgh’s

Strip District, no pun intended, but there’s a lot to do
here. So are you going to take advantage or are you
going to make your own excitement again?

MC: What I’ve done since that incident and just some
other stupidity that happened a couple weeks later is
only drink beer now. It really saves you from a lot of
grief. So I’m not too worried about that. But yeah, it’s
deﬁnitely nice having stuff around. It does get tough
when you’re in a hotel that’s miles away from a restau-
rant. It’s, like, what the hell do you do? You drink, you
know? "

TPN: I really like how, in “Open Road Song” and a
few others, you use three different spellings and mean-
ings of the same word in one verse. How did you get
the idea to do that?

MC: Just came out. And then I realized, “Whoa, that’s
really cool.” I think I just wrote it like that because it
sounded good and then I realized that I had just used
every meaning of that word. I deﬁnitely was listening

to, at the time, songwriters that did a lot of
3 , word—play tricks like that.

TPN: Allmusic.com lists your roots and inﬂu-

 ences as Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam. Those are
the only two inﬂuences listed. Any truth to
that? 2 ‘

MC: Not bad bands at all, but inﬂuences? I
deﬁnitely wouldn’t say so. It says inﬂuences,
not bands that kind of lump into some sound?

TPN: There are similar bands listed, and the
one that jumps out at‘ me right now is Seven
Mary Three. '

MC: Oh, Jesus. That hurts my feelings. I’m
not kidding._ Someone’s not doing their job.

TPN: Someone else isn’t going to use that
Web site anymore. In that case, what are your
favorite bands/inﬂuences?

MC: J awbreaker was deﬁantly a really big
inﬂuence. Green Day was a big inﬂuence. Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers, early on for sure.
Early on, California punk music and then we
got into the Pixies, indie rock from there. Now,
I’m all about Creedence Clearwater [Revival],
Biggie Smalls, just whatever is good. Back in
high school it was like, “If it’s not this, it’s not
cool.” I guess you grow out of that.

« TPN: What do you hope that long—time fans
will get out of It’s All in Your Head?

MC; I hope they’ll relate to it. To me, that’s
what’s special about music, what makes it’
important. Just relating, feeling a connection
to somebody, feeling like somebody’s speak-
ing to you. It’s that simple, really. . .

Sex, lies and family videotape

Capturing the Friedmans

Directed by Andrew Jarecki
‘£‘r7,“r7L‘r 1/2

“Capturing the Friedmans” is a documen— -
tary that will likely sadden and outrage you, but

I recommend it highly.

The destruction of a family, which the audi-
ence watches at a proximity that would intimi-
date even the most hard-core reality TV
junkies, is sad. The justice dealt by the
legal system for the crime that destroys

them is scary.

___Back in the j‘80s, before disaster
struck, the Friedinans might have been
the perfect family. Dad Arnold was a
-t celebrated teacher. Mother Elaine was a
homemaker. Their sons, David, Seth and Jesse,
were a trio of happy—go—lucky adolescents. And
they all lived comfortably in Great Neck, an

upscale, Long Island town.

Things go bad in 1987, when the authorities
find that Arnold has a large stash of child
pornography. He admits to being a pedophile,
but claims he’s never acted on his urges. He’s
been teaching computer and piano lessons inhis
home for several years, though, so the police
have to start questioning Arno1d’s students.

\ \ \

‘“;r';r';r';‘r—— Miss Un.i1*erse

The accusations start and never stop —— and
appear suspiciously like mass hysteria —
implicating not only Arnold, but also 18-year-
old Jesse, in over 1,000 acts of sexual abuse.
Part of the Friedmans’ story is the life—ruin-
ing prosecution of father and son, whose possi-
ble innocence doesn’t even enter the mind of a
single soul in Great Neck, outside of the fami— ,
ly. We hear weak, improbable and conflicting

descriptions of the“ alleged crimes and,

though we know Arnold isn’t com-
pletely innocent, we have to doubt
that he and his son, especially, are

this guilty.

Harris Theater.

Thanks to the boys’ apparent
obsession with video cameras —— it
seems they tape everything — we see
how the Friedmans are affected at, for exam-
ple, the dinner table. It’s incredibly emotional
stuff, the kind of reality we rarely get to see.
Director Andrew J arecki would have a worth-
while documentary even without the home
movies, but their inclusion makes “Capturing

the Friedmans” something truly special.

Constantly evolving music

De-Loused in the

Comatorium
The Mars Volta
Universal Records
Mani/2 A

When indie rock heroes At the

Drive-in called it quits in 2001, the

grunge—loving world went spastic,
Wetting beds and dampening tissues
for weeks on end. At the Drive—in’s
members parted, vowing to make new

music —— just not together.
Now, the little pieces of
Cedric Bixler and

Omar Rodriguez

have metallically re-
fused and taken the
form of The Mars
Volta. '
Ikey Owens,’ of the post-

Sublime Long Beach Dub Al1—Stars,
and Flea, Jane’s Addiction rent—a—

bassist and long—time Red Hot Chili
Pepper, both had experience working
with splinter groups. Rolled up togeth-
er, the Volta resembles the surviving
crash dummies of several other smash-
ups. And everyone who can hum the
song “Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm,”
knows that dummies make good
music.

Mars Volta take the high standards
inherited from their At the Drive—in
days and crush them, creating the Pink
Floyd—space—rock—meets—Santana—solo-
guitar triumph of De—L0used in the
Comatorimn. De-What in de Where?

Don’t try to pronounce anything
on the album, which has song titles
like “Tira Me A Las Aranas” and
“Eriatarka.” Just listen to them and
enjoy. Immediately, you feel back at
home with Bixler’s vocals — one of
the best elements of At the Drive—in,
now one of the best elements of The

Mars Volta. Don’t expect any

Top—40 singles though.

Most of the songs

stretch past the

seven—minute

mark, but don’t

worry — none of it

will make your eyelids

heavy. De-Loused in the

Comatorium isn’t really an album of

singles anyway; it’s more like one long

song that evolves over its hour—long
life span.

Newcomers to The Mars Volta,
rejoice. You have a record that doesn’t
sound like anything else you own.
Diehard At" the Drive—in fans, pray for
a tour date near you and stop pouting.

T for you, T for me, there should have been no T3

Terminator 3: Rise.-of the
Machines

Starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl,
Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken
Directed by Jonathan Mostow
7:

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A & E Editor

“Terminator 3: Rise of the
Machines”, is a film without a point,
a film that didn’t need to be made
and a film that, worst of all, leaves
you asking, “Why should I care
about this or whatcame before it?”
“T3” revolves around yet another
Terminator, the T-X (Kristanna
Loken), who was sent back through
time to kill all of John Connor’s
(Nick Stahl) lieutenants because, as
the T—lOl (Arnold Schwarzenegger)
explains, Connor couldn’t be locat-
ed. That’s an interesting develop-
ment, considering that, 12 years
ago, the T—1000 — obsolete com-
pared to the T-X — seemed very
willing and able to take the neces-
sary steps to locate the future head
of the human resistance against the
machines.

The T-X must be really lazy.

One of the targets on the T-X’s
list is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes),
a veterinarian who, in the future, is
Connor’s wife and second—in—com-
mand. It turns out that she sent the
T-101 back through time to protect
herself and, in the process, sets into
motion the events that lead the two
young freedom fighters—to-be on the
path of love. Nothing like a good,
half-assed paradox to get you

through the heat and humidity of the I

summer.

But why does any of this take
place? All the cybernetic stuff that
would eventually lead to the
destruction of mankind - was
destroyed in “Terminator 2.” That
was the point of the film, after all:
to prevent Judgment Day. Luckily,
we get a quarter-baked explanation
from the T-101 — Judgment Day is
inevitable.

Great. Why watch the movie if
the goal, to stop Judgment Day,
can't be achieved? I

In this newest installment, the
guiding hand of “Terminator” cre-
ator and visionary James Cameron
is entirely absent, and it’s sorely
missed. With his absence, the film
loses direction, writing, effects,
scope, story, character development
and pace. V

In his place is director Jonathan

‘Mostow, directing a film written by

three people who give us lines like,
“Talk to-the hand,”'— coming from
Arnold —— and situations where the
once-intimidating screen presence
is made to wear Elton John-

esque, star—shaped g1ass- 1/*"j"
es. Nothing is off-limits '  I
for this writing trio’s  
disgusting use of self-

parody. T’.

Then there is the new,
female Terminator. Why is the
T-X a woman? It’s nice to see sexu-
al equality existing in science fic-
tion, but the T-X exists, only to sat-

 

isfy the wet dreams of nerds and
geeks. This character could have
easily been a male and accom-

plished the same aim as is 'accom—'

plished with Loken — nothing. The
idea of a female Terminator
is an interesting one;

   shame on the writers for

 squandering it only to
fulfill their high school
fantasies.
But that’s sympto-
matic of the overall lack of char-
acter development. These characters
are as one-dimensional as one-
dimensional gets. We meet them,

stuff happens, they give in and
accept their fate. The previous two
films were all about characters that
had a. of fate thrust on them and
how they dealt with that burden
internally and externally; a bunch of
action-oriented things just happened
to them’ ‘along the way. In the
process, they became more than
characters; they became people.
Here, we get action, action, action
and pesky characters thrown into the

mix. Luckily, Cameron is “King of.

the World,” so the pain from this
destruction of his -cinematic creation
will be somewhat numbed.
Mostow’s direction is just as bad
as the writing. The scope here is that
of a bad made-for-TV‘film that gets
played at noon on a Sunday on UPN.
Everything is closed off, fake and
mundane. There are periods in the
film where you can almost smell the
sound stage on which they are film-
ing. Cameron used real places, but
when he used sets, they were gigan-
tic things that echoed reality. Here,
that approach was thrown away to
spend more on the special effects,
which are, surprisingly, horrendous.
' The fights between the T-X and
T-101 are poorly created, and any-
one with a functional handful of
brain cells can tell when these
scenes become fake. “T2” had real
fights between the two Terminators.
They made the film more real than it
would have been by just seeing a
liquid metal guy running around and
shape shifting. In “T3,” however,
the geniuses who thought the film
was a good idea inthe first place
have again-shredded the playbook
from the previous films and opted to
go with lackluster CGI effects.vAnd,
given the astronomical budget this

film had, thespecial effects should,

have been good enough to be a sav-
ing grace. Instead, they’re salt in the
wound.

The anger and resentment that
“T3” will churn up in fans of the
classic “T2” has no bounds.
Everything about it is bad. There is
no redeeming value. Ultimately, the
film seems to exist only to create a
“T4,” yet another unnecessary entry
into the series. How dare these “cre-
ative forces” take the “Terminator”
films and defile and exploit them,
simply because Hollywood is cre-
atively bankrupt and caught in the
throngs of sequel and prequel mad-
ness?

Where “T2” had scope, story,
characters, effects and action so
good that awe dripped off of every
frame, the only thing that drips off
“T3” is the three-week-old cheese
you get with those overpriced
nachos at the concession stand.

Berenato brings
new hope to Pitt

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM‘
Staff Writer

Three months ago, Agnus Berenato.

was enjoying the aftermath of Georgia
Tech’s most successful Women’s basket-
ball season in, her 15-year tenure as the
school’s head coach. -

In- 2002-2003, the Yellow Jackets
upset rival Georgia, won 20 games and
advanced to their ﬁrst NCAA Women’s
Tournament under Berenato. The future
looked even brighter for Berenato, and the
Yellow Jackets, because they lost only
one player to graduation and boasted a
nationally ranked recruiting class. '

. Three months ago, Berenato’s two
sons were facing major academic transi-
tions. Her oldest son, Andy, was prepar-
ing to graduate from high, school and

attend Tech in the fall, and her youngest

son, ‘ Joey, was making the move from

eighth grade to high school. '
Three months ago, words like

“Primanti’s,” “Cathedral of Learning”

and “Petersen Events Center” were’
‘unknown to Berenato. -She had never

been to Pittsburgh, and, in her own words,
“didn’t even know that Pittsburgh was on

head coach of Women’s basketball at Pitt?

“The big thing was timing,” Berenato
said. “When Pitt ﬁrst called me, to be
honest, I had no interest in moving; I was
a lifer at Georgia Tech. But they called
several times, and ﬁnally I spoke to them
“I think it was just the overwhelming
sense that they wanted somebody to come
up here that would really care about the
program, care about the athletic depart-
ment and care about the community,” she

said. The administration was so cormnit- L

ted to women’s basketball, and I am so
excited and so " thankful to Chancellor
[Mark] Nordenberg and [senior associate
athletic director] Carol Sprague for hav-
ing the courage to hire me.”

Although Berenato was a tough sell,
there were several other factors that
brought her to Pitt.

Berenato has family ties to the area:
She is a native of Gloucester City, N.J., a
Philadelphia suburb. Her daughter,
Theresa, attends Loyola University in
Baltimore, and with her two sons chang-
ing schools anyway, she didn’t have to
worry about the ‘academic and social
effects ‘of relocating.

“I would have never left Tech unless

water.” .

; it was a comparable conference, and

_ ‘So what caused Berenato to leave her

Berenato, page 12

Thoughts oI,1th6,ll—Star game and being white

This Fourth of July, I got burnt. _
No, it was not another mishap with the fire-
works or an accident at the grill. I sat in the sun
too long and turned my back into something that
looked like a fried wookie.
What was the reason for’  .
this‘? Maybe the sun is just-too
_bright sometimes, or maybe my '
dumb ass forgot to put sun-
screen on my back.
_ But according to Cubs man-
ager Dusty Baker, my back got
toasted because I’m a white boy

. from New.Hampshire.

“It’s easier for most Latin guys and it’s easier
for most minority people, because most of us
come from heat,” Baker said in a press conference
on Saturday. “You don’t find too many brothers in

‘New Hampshire and Maine and the Upper

Peninsula of Michigan. Right?”
Baker went on to say that this, according to

   

history, isjwhy black people were brought over
here —,—— because they “could take the heat.”-
“That’s a fact. I’m not making this up,” he
continued. “I’m not. seeing some brothers walking
i ' around with some white stuff on
E  their ears and noses.”

' While it’s true that there
aren’t that many “brothers” in
New Hampshire or Maine, I’m
willing to bet that the need for

‘ players who can take the heat
probably doesn’t'carry over to
 baseball.

Don’t worry, Barry Bonds
and Albert Pujols. We know you're, playing in the
All-Star game because you’-re good, not because
you can stay in the kitchen.

-——For this year’s All-Star game, make sure you get
yourself a program. _
This year’s game features 30 players making

their first All-Star appearance, 15 from each
league. Two of those first-timers, Marcus Giles
and Hideki Matsui, are starting. .

_ More than half of the new guys (17) are pitch-
ers. In.fact, no pitcher on the American League
roster has beento more than two All-Star games.
Only Roy Halladay, Eddie Guardado and Barry
Zito have made an All-Star roster before.

What could this possibly mean?

My guess would be that the face of baseball is
changing. Some of the guys not appearing in
Chicago next Tuesday include Sammy Sosa,
Roger -Clemens, Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling,
Pedro Martinez, Derek Jeter and Ivan Rodriguez.

Those seven players have collectively partici-
pated in 40 All-Star games since 1993, topped by
Rodriguez’s nine straight appearances during that
s an.

P While guys like Jeter,—Martinez and Sosa are

Berenato helped lead Georgia Tech to NCAA tournament

obviously the Big East is a great confer-

ence,” Berenato said. “I also needed a ‘

comparable city. I’m a city girl _—
Pittsburgh and Atlanta.”

Growing up, Berenato was one of 10
siblings. She says that the values she
learned as a member of a large, caring
family helped shape not only who she is
as a coach, but also as a human being.

“I think family has made me who I
am,” Berenato said. “Coaching is simply
what I do. My values and my beliefs are
who I am. God and family come f1rst in
my life, and my career is second. When

you are raised with 10 kids, you learn that
no one is more important than anyone
else.” , _
Berenato attended Mount St.- Mary’s
College in Emmitsburg, Md., where she
was a three—year starter on the basketball
team. Shortly after graduating in 1980,
she took the head-coaching job at Rider
University in Trenton, N.J.  her ﬁrst
season at Rider, Berenato led the Broncos
to a 26-7 record, the best in school histo-
ry. After compiling a 60-55 record in four
seasons at Rider, Berenato left the school
in 1985 to care for her ailing mother. '
Berenato returned to coaching in
1986 as an assistant for Georgia Tech. For

two years, she was in charge of recruiting
and frontcourt coaching for the Yellow
Jackets, under her sister, Theresa
McGlade. '

In 1988, Berenato became Tech’s
head basketball coach, and in 15 seasons,
she became the 'school’s all-tirne win-
ningest coach, amassing a 223-209
record. Berenato led the Yellow Jackets to
the 1992 National Women’s Invitational
Tournament Championship and has taken
Tech to the postseason each of the last
four years. ’

es, and she says that Pitt’s fertile recruit-
ing base was another factor in her move.
She plans to recruit both locally and inter-
nationally. ,

' “Academically, we have a multitude
of majors,” Berenato said. “Pittsburgh has

‘ an international airport, and our acade-

mics are known internationally. Andiwe
have, without a doubt, the finest playing
facility in the nation. These are all great
recruiting selling points.”

But the task of turning the Pitt’

women’s basketball program around A

won’t be easy for Berenato. The Panthers
ﬁnished 4-12 in Big East play last season
and Pitt lost four impact seniors in guards
Lajne Selwyn and Brooke Stewart and
forwards Dallas Williams and Mandy
Wittenmyer.- » . '

“I can tell you we have 30 points and

11 rebounds coming back from last year’s ’

team,” Berenato said. “The graduating
class walked out with 40 points and 22
rebounds.” I

“I haven’t really seen the underclassmen
play, I’ll be honest with you, because.
even if we put in a.-Videotape, they’re not
on it. They didn’t play last season. But I
really like them as people, and I know that
the. student—athletes at the University of
Pittsburgh will be committed to gettingva
good academic degree and performing at

a high leve .”
- Berenato’s enthusiasm for turning the *

program around extends to her work off
the court. She believes that community
outreach is as important of a part of build-
ing a program as winning, and she admits
that raising attendance will be crucial to
Pitt women’s basketball’s overall success.

“ I’m not coming in here with rose-
colored glas‘ses,,thinking we’re going to
upset everybody right away,” . Berenato
said. “I’m very realistic; however, we are
already starting to win, because we’re
winning within the community.”

“I really believe that this will be the
best kept secret in Pittsburgh, and that, in

A the future, we willget people in the stands

because we will motivate and we will be
exciting.”

their names have been replaced by

- One good reason for guys like Sosa
and Jeter not being at thevAll—Star
game is that they don’t deserve to
be. .

Had it not been for injuries and,
in Sosa’s case, a suspension, these
guys probably would be putting up
All—Star type numbers. But that’s
not the case.

Compared to the two shortstops
on the AL roster — Alex Rodriguez
and Nomar Garciaparra — Jeter is
hitting four points better than
Rodriguez, but trails Garciaparra by
32 points. Jeter has also hit fewer
home runs (five) and driven in fewer
runs (20) than both Rodriguez (21,
54) and Nomar (13, 57). -

Rondell White is the only out-
fielder on the NL roster to have a
lower batting average (.284) than
Sosa (.286). With his 13 home runs
and 41,RBIs, Sosatrails all seven

would be his final season, some
have said that Clemens belongs on
the AL All—Star team for a final
time.

The problem with" that is that
Clemens isn’t even one of the best
pitcherson his team, let alone in the
AL. David Wells, Mike Mussina and
Andy Pettitte all have more wins (10
each) than Clemens (eight), and only
Pettitte has as many losses (six). 

None of those three pitchers, nor
either Ba1timore’s Sidney Ponson

(11 wins) or Boston’s Derek Lowe .

(10), made the All-Star team.

If guys with better numbers
aren’t going to the game, why
should Clemens get to go?

And if he should get to go
because it is his last season, then let
commissioner Bud Selig make him a
special invite, like he did with Tony
Gwynn during Gwynn’s final ‘sea-
son.

Clemens shouldn’t take a roster
spot from someone who deserves it
more just because this is his last
chance to play in an All-Star game.

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor
for The Pitt News and he has gifieh
up his roster spot at the All-Star
game because, face it, ,he’s just not
that good. '
