SARS threat keeps
students outof Asia

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Ranit Lieberman is somewhat relieved to
not be going to 

She —— like the other students who are
planning to attend the summer session of
Semester at Sea — found out that several of the
planned stops in East Asia were changed
because of the worldwide epidemic known as
severe acuterespiratory syndrome, or SARS.

“It’s a good thing,” she said about the
changes in the itinermy. “I don’t know if my
parents would have agreed to let me go [if the
changes weren’t made].”

According to the World ‘Health
Organization, SARS’ symptoms include fever,

cough, and shortness of breath or difﬁculty.

breathing. Though doctors can treat the symp-
toms, there is no cure currently available.
Though some students, like Aaron Probst,

aren’t aﬁaid of getting SARS, Probst agreed

with the decision to redirect the trip. He pointed
out that, if even one student contracted SARS,
it could beoorne a problem for everyone on the

trip. He added that he had, nevertheless, looked
forward to visiting China. V

, Instead of the plarmed tour of the Paciﬁc
Rim, which included stops in China and
Vietnam, the boat will visit Australia, Fiji, New
Zealand and Hawaii.

. “Either way, it’s really cool,” Lieberman
said She addedthat she has dreamed of visiting
Australia for a long time. The ship will make
port stops in Alaska, Russia and Japan, accord-
ing to the SAS Web site. ’

As of May 10, there were 4,884 cases of
SARSreportedinChinawith235casesresult—
ing in death, according to WHO.

Since the SARS outbreak, the State
Department issued several travel advisories and
warnings about traveling to mainland China,
Hong,Kong, Taiwan and Toronto.-

Oﬂicials at the University Honors College
also decided to change summer travel plans
because of SARS; they canceled the college’s
annual tripto Mongolia, which included a visit
to Hong Kong that was canceled earlier.

school gets
$10.5 million

lrnagine the possibilities created by $10.5

million. .

. Ofﬁcials at Pitt’s School of Engineering no
longer have to limit themselves to imagining
possibilities—they can beneﬁt from them,
thanks to Pitt alumnus George M. Bevier’s
estate.

Bevier, who graduated in 1913, made his
money as a petroleum geologist by inventing a
seismograph, used to locate oil and gas ﬁelds.
He held positions in the U.S. government, pri-

_ vate companies and the independent ﬁeld.

During Bevier’s career, Pitt gave him an
honorary doctorate in science in 1937 and the
School of Engineering Distinguished Alumnus
award in 1964. Bevier died in 1972.

According to a Pitt press release, “[Bevier -

was] one of the ﬁrst geologists in the nation to
combine geology and geophysics in the explo-
ration of oil and gas, techniques which con-
tributed to his discovery of the main production
area of the Conroe oﬂ ﬁelds in Montgomery

County, Texas, one of the leading ﬁelds of oil’

and gas production in the state and nation.”

The engineering school willuse the $10.5
million gift to create a chair and a fellowship in
Bevier’s name. The awards will be given to
“support programs in bioengineering, sustain-
ability, and energy and resources,” according to
the press release.

Gerald Holder, the U.S. Steel Dean of
Engineering, said, - “The Bevier Chair and
Bevier. Fellowships will allow ‘us to attract and

retain outstanding faculty and students, respec- .

tively, in these critical areas.”

Though this latest donation  the largest ’

single endowment ever made to the School of
Engineering, this was not the only gift Bevier
gave Pitt. In the time since he graduated,
Bevier created the Bevier Engineering Library

and donated money to Pitt’s petroleum en '-« A A

Holder addedin the press release, “this gift.

Pitt student is Ultimate Survivor

Jenna Morasca knows that it pays to be
a swimsuit model stuck in the Amazon.

The 22-year-old Pitt student beat 15
other competitors to win the rnillion—dollar
prize awarded to the ultimate survivor on
the season finale of “Survivor: The
Amazon” Sunday night.

A native of Bridgeville, Pa., majoring
in zoology at Pitt’s College of General
Studies, Morasca has modeled for Stuff
Magazine and Maxim, and perfomrs inter-
views for Pittsburgh’s local Fox Sports
afliliate. She has competed in the Hawaiian
Tropic and Venus beauty pageants and was
the second runner—up in the Miss
Pennsylvania USA beauty pageant.

Morasca, who lost nearly 20 pounds
during the 39-day ordeal ﬁlmed last fall,
announced on the CBS Early Show that she
plans to use her prize money to pay off col-
lege loans and take her mom on a vacation.
She said that, since returning to Pittsburgh
in December after taping the show, she
spent her time working out and enjoying
chocolate to gain back the weight she lost in
the Amazon.

Morasca’s love of chocolate became
apparent to viewers in the seventh episode
of the season, when she and fellow com-
petitor Heidi Strobel stripped naked to earn
a snack of chocolate and peanut butter.

The sixth season of “Survivor,” which
featured sixteen contestants battling

through obstacles in the Amazon wilder-
ness, was recognized by many of the series’
fans as the best since the extreme game
show premiered in the surrnner of 2000.

they become married.

administrators worked at “harmonizing

Cancelling trips

SARS, page 1

' Although WHO officials reported
1,674 probable cases and 212 deaths in
Hong Kong as of May 10, health risks were
not at the front of every st11dent’s mind.

John Paul Oleksiuk says SARS was not
even among his ﬁve biggest concerns.

Oleksiuk planned to join the group in
Mongolia late in the trip because of his prior
commitments with the rowing team. He said
he was more worried about navigating his
way alone through foreign airports on his
ﬁrst trip outside the East Coast than getting
SARS.

Since Probst and Oleksiuk were not
seriously concerned about contracting
SARS on their visits, both said they proba-
bly would not have taken any special pre-
cautions while in Asia.

“Personally, I think it was at little
extreme,” Oleksiuk said of the trip cancella-
tion, which he learned about three weeks
ago. He said he believes the trip would have
been risky without western medical facili-
ties.

Oleksiuk pointed out that Mongoliahas
a large population and that Mongolian offi-
cials have reported about the same number
of SARS cases as reported in Pemrsylvania.
Some cases may go unreported in
Mongolia, he added.

THE PITT NEWS

Online students graduate

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s first online students can
finally turn off their computers; they
have graduated.

Two years ago, Pitt started its first
online degree program, FastTrack, and
two weeksago, the program graduated
its first class.

FastTrack allows students to
receive a master’s degree in library
and information science programming,
recognized by the Committee on
Accreditation of the American Library
Association, by taking classes over the
Internet. ‘ - v _

Recent graduate Marycatherine
McGarvey said students communicat-
ed with their professors and sent their
coursework online
Blackboard, Pitt’s online course man-
agement program. Professors listed the
required work on Blackboard, allow-
ing students to do it at their own con-
venience before the designated dead-
lines. I

According to a Pitt press release,
Ronald Larsen, the dean of Pitt’s
School of Information Sciences, said,
“As the first online degree program at
the University ‘ of Pittsburgh, this
became an experiment in a number of
ways, from transforming our informa-
tional delivery to building a communi-
ty among students distributed across
the country.”

Larsen said the program was creat-
ed to extend SIS’s “outstanding” mas-

_.ter’s program to a larger area outside

of Oakland. ,

Pitt’s reputation in library educa-
tion helped to entice students who live
outside of Pittsburgh, like McGarvery,
to register with the program.

“What attracted me to_ the program
was the fact that it was the University
of Pittsburgh,” McGarvey, who lives
in Norristown, Pa. with her husband
and three children, said.

“The recognition of the school was
worth any aggravation,” she added.

For six weeks during her program,
McGarvey had to deal with problems
affecting her home Internet access
after Excite went bankrupt, she said.
But with her professors’ support and
the use of her neighbors’ and office
computers, she worked through it.

McGarvey worked with Windows
and similar software at her library job
and helped to open a computer lab at
the Montgomery County, Norristown
Library when she was halfway through
the FastTrack program.

The 35 graduates came from
Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada,
New , York, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C.

FastTrack not only allowed stu-
dents to come from different places,

through '

but it opened doors for the many stu-
dents who returned to education later
in their lives, after being out in the
working world for several years.

Students had an average of five
years’ experience in library work, and
the average age of the students
enrolled was 39 years.

To receive their online master’s
degrees, students had to finish at least
36 credits.

Some. students, including
McGarvey and Moira Tyrell, enrolled
in Pitt’s program because it allowed
them to stay at home with their chil-
dren while still getting an education.

When she started, Tyrell was liv-
ing in Pittsburgh. She called Pitt to see
what programs it had to offer and
learned about the new FastTrack pro-
gram.

“The instructors were very profes-
sional and were very knowledgeable
about the various subjects they
taught,” she said. “I think this comes
from the fact that most of them actual-
ly worked in the field and had first-
hand knowledge.”

Another student, Bill Yurvati,

liked the program because it allowed
him to keep his job as a library techni-
cian at Kutztown University while he
pursued an education to become a pro-
fessional librarian in’ an academic
library. .
Though students did the majority
of their coursework over the Internet,
they were required to Visit Pitt for
eight days at the beginning of their
first summer term, and then for one
long weekend during each subsequent
term.-

The visits allowed students to
complete specific course requirements,
participate in computer training and
get to know other students and their
professors. -

McGarvey said she and other stu-
dents looked forward to their week-
ends in Pittsburgh, and some even
made the required three-day visit into
a four—day “mini-vacation.”

Starting the program and graduat-
ing with the same set of students
helped create bonds among the stu-
dents, even though they might have
been miles apart, McGarvey said.

“I knew my [FastTrack] class-
mates better than I knew my class-
mates in undergraduate school,” she
said. ~

She also learned more about her
professors through the FastTrack pro-
gram. In undergraduate schooling,
most professors could recognize a stu-
dent’s name, but not place the name
with a face, McGarvey said. In the
online program, students talked with
theirlprofessors directly, either through
e—mail or on the telephone, so they all
knew each other very well, she added.

Times accountable for Blair’s fraudulence

’ The New York Times — the most
prominent newspaper ‘in the country, if not
the world — published an article on May 11

detailing the lies and half—trutlis written by p

one of its stalf reporters, Jayson Blair.

This extensive report examined Blair’s
recent writing, ﬁnding that at least 36 of the
73 articles he’d written since October con-
tained fraudulent journalism. One of his
chief offenses was that he said he reported
from locales as exotic as West Virginia and

Maryland, while writing from New York’

City. He was, therefore, not witness to some
of the scenes he 

The article also examined Blair’s tenure
at The Times and the series of ignored repri-
mands and hesitant promotions that allowed
him to be a successful liar.

The Times owed its readers an apology
for Blair, and duly delivered one.

Though they cite communication fail-
ures, few reader complaints and systematic
ﬁaud as reasons for Blair’s actions not being

exposed until now, The Times left its arro-
gance off the list.

Believing that such fabrications could
not occur so frequently and ﬂagrantly at a
publication as respected as theirs cost them
credibility. They must now accept the conse-
quences of both his and their actions.

They forgot that newspapers, as well as
reporters, are responsible to the readers. .

As journalists, we must be skeptical.
Producing an unbiased, accurate paper
requires, not only style, but also an unswerv—
ing commitment to truth. As a newspaper,

we help create our readers’ perceptions of
events.

But we do not‘ create reality.

Reporters act as ﬁlters between events

and readers. The onus is rightly placed on‘
them to check_facts. Newspapers cannot rest -

on their reputations. If The Times lies, who
can be trusted?
Still, readers must not be passive con-

‘ sumers of news. People should not accept

what they see or read as the alpha and omega
of truth, regardless of how committed to
accuracy the publication is. I
A survey of our readership showed that
40 percent rely on The Pitt News as their
sole news source. Given the task of serving
the student‘ body, we strive /for truth,
acknowledging our mistakes where they
The Times —— which promoted Blair
through the ranks, despite repeated objec-
tions from a top editor — should do the
same. Arrogance has no place in journalism

‘ The Blair scandal should be a reality check
. for writers and readers.

For instance, The Times reported that
The Diamondback — the University of
Maryland student newspaper for which
Blair worked — began checking its archives
for errors, showing their dedication to truth,
even truth that’s years old.

If words stamped in print offend com-
mon sense, don’t believe them unquestion-
ingly. Blair was able to succeed because not
enough people spoke up, and those who did
were ignored

ll/Iusic far-is need ticket lotteries, Cheetos

Those who have been on campus in
the past month may have noticed the
increasing number of musical acts who
have made the Petersen Events Center the
hot Pittsburgh venue.

Just before ﬁnals week, I was unable
to move my car from an
upper—carnpus lot above the
Pete because streams of pre-
teen girlsjﬁlled the streets on

minimal fee of ﬁve dollars. This would
require both they and their parents to
spend at least 36 straight hours camped in
the lounge of the William Pitt Union, eat-
ing week-old Cheetos.

After this, 2,500 winning wristband
numbers will be drawn.

If Pitt isn’t going to bring in acts that
appeal to a greater number of its students,
it could at least let us in on the action in an
eﬁort to make up for basketball ticket-

In accordance with Pitt’s policies‘ sur-
rounding other ticket sales, here is what
should happen: First, if kids want to get
tickets to see Lavigne at the Pete, they
would have to wait in a line in order to
pick up a ticket—lottery wristband for the

tickets.

All the whiny, little kids who didn’t
win the ticket lottery will be able to pur-
chase a ticket to the concert from any one
of the 5,000 student ticket scalpers who
surround the Pete hours before show time.

After all of the tickets have been
scalped, the students, who will all learn an
important lesson in entrepreneurship, will

Wednesday, May 14, 2003

So, you want to be a university: Pitt’s guide for La Roche

La Roche College announced
plans to reorganize its departments
into three schools, thereby shedding
the “college” moniker and prepar-
ing to don the title of “university.”

Now, while the trumpets blare
and the peasants rejoice at this new-
found university-hood, there are a

few things La Roche should know.

First, being a university isn’t
just about having multiple schools

with confusing alphabet-soup
acronyms.
It’s about higher purposes,

greater goals and, most importantly,
tuition hikes. ‘

I was pleased to read in the May
14 Pittsburgh Post—Gazette that La
Roche had done its homework and
hiked tuition by 19 percent last
October.

I was also pleased with the mas-
sive layoffs and multimi1lion—dollar
building project that it has institut-
ed. -

Nice work, La Roche! Those are
the true signs of a university.

Chancellor Nordenberg must be
getting all choked up knowing that
other schools are following in his
panther tracks.

But so far, La Roche’s measures
are not enough. University-ness
does not come easy.

La Roche, located in the North

Hills, must dedicate itself to being

as truly universitarian as it can.

Fortunately, Pitt is here-to take
this college by its little hand and
lead it to, the promised land of bas-
ketball-ticket lotteries and a pro-
nounced disdain for its

Names affect who we are, what we do, things

My name, as you can see, is
Marty.

In the adult world, however,
where my credit card, my driver’s
license and my paychecks hold
sway, I cease to be Marty.

I am Martin T. Flahertyt IV,
which means I was preceded by
three. In the minds of my relatives,
there must be a fifth and, therefore,
anything other than heterosexuality,
marriage and enough sex to transmit
a Y-chromosome would be consid-
ered a ﬂaw.

When I was born, my father
‘reputedly took his father aside. My
grandfather asked what my name

would be, to which my father
replied, “Kermit.”

The joke was that, since my sis-
ters were named Kelley and Keely,
my father would stick with the Ks,
rather than with the patriarchal lin-
eage.

My grandfather had never con-
sidered an option other than my
being Martin the Fourth, and my
father thought of any other option as
a joke. ' 4

I.was an expectation. I had been
planned for and named years in
advance, and I was destined to be
the next link in a heritage.

If my mother had been unable to
conceive after she had birthed my

' the decisions he made.

sisters, would the line have ended
there, or would my father have
sought another wife? If I had been
born earlier, before my two sisters,
would my parents have continued
having children?

I don’t ask these questions
because I expect to ever find an
answer; I ask them because I wish I
knew how much my
father’s name inﬂuenced

From this, I might
learn how much inﬂuence
my name could have over
the choices I make.

I knew, by the time I
was five, that the Flaherty
side of my family was
expecting Martin the
Fifth. There is surely
motivation to live up to
these expectations.

But I am clearly not always
Martin — partly because Martin is
not a name that women want to call
out during sex — so I go by Marty.

“Marty” was also the title of an
Oscar-winning film starring Ernest
Borgnine, not to mention the name
of the hero in “Back to the Future.”

None of my grade—school class-
mates were familiar with the former,
but I was long referred to as
“McFly.”

‘that,

But more frequently, I was
Marty as in, “Marty"Farty had a
party/ everyone was there/ Tutti
Frutti laid a beauty/ they all went
out for air.” A

Somehow, this managed to
remain clever, at least in the minds
of my tormentors, for several years.

I’ve always wondered whether
this name—based ridicule
was a cause or merely a
method, .

Did my name, simply
through rhyming with
another word, merit deri-
sion?

Or did my peers dis-
like me, and choose to
express this in the most
readily available medi-
um?

I choose to believe
the latter because I like to believe
later, -when I was called
“Smarty,” it was because my intelli-
gence merited it, not merely because
it rhymed with my’ name.

This compliment more than off-
set the various insults that came
attached to my name. After all,
name jokes are something that hap-
pen toalmost everybody.

At home, I have an altogether
different name.

My dog’s name is Gentry. My

said during sex

aunt’s name is Joyce. Along with my
name and my sisters’ names, these
make up the naming conventions
that my mother has had for years.
When I go home," my mom
addresses me as GentryKeelyMarty,
without pauses between names. My
sisters are JoyceKeelyKelley and
MartyKelleyKeely.

This is not deliberate or consis- .

tent, but the general rule is that we
wait until the third name to deter-
mine Whom she’s talking to. V

I can’t say why this happens, but
the “why” of it doesn’t particularly
matter.

The important‘ thing is that my
mother fails to get my name right on
the first try. .

I should probably get upset at
this but I don’t, if for no other rea-
son than the fact that it might be
genetic. ’ K _ i

I once called a friend, got, her
answering machine, and began my
message, “Hey Marty, it’s Kate.”
She thought it was cute and played
it at parties.

Yet when I do it during sex, it’s '

not cute, it’s narcissistic.

Apparently.

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA

Assistant A & E Editor §

‘The Matrix Reloaded” is abreathless piece of ﬁlm-
making that never gives the audience a break from itsbig
philosophical questions and even bigger action, once
they are plugged in. ,

Neo (Keanu Reeves) struggles with his growing
powers as The One, as well as his troubling dreams of
his lover/compatriot Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is
herself faced with dealing and comprehending Neo’s
growing inner turmoil. Morpheus (Laurence Fishbume)
is pitted against Lock (Harry Lennix), the commander of
the Resistance, partly because of “their love for the same
woman, N iobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), but mostly because

. of their differing views on the defense of Zion —
Morpheus trusts the prophecies of the Oracle (Gloria
Foster), while Lock trusts in building up defenses and
counterattacks.

' Compounding these struggles is a greater one: an
impending attack from 250,000 squid-like Sentinels,
enforcers for the machines in the “real” world, on the last
human outpost, the city Zion, and the human Resistance.

“The Matrix Reloaded” takes its place in the pan-
theon of great sequels, alongside ﬁlms such as “The
Empire Strikes Bac ” and “Terminator 2.” Directors
Andy and Larry Wachowskihave a much tighter grip
and more ﬂuid style in the direction of this installment,

focused ideas of control, causality and predetermination,
among others. While, at times, it is a task to understand

‘ some of the dialogue concerning these issues and, with

the questions never given concrete answers, these issues
work perfectly well in the established world of “The
Matrix.” And by posing its questions without fully
answering them, the ﬁlm is elevated above the usual
trite, brainless, popcorn action ﬂicks that are so com-
monly found during the summer season. .

But people will be drawn to “The Matrix Reloaded”
by its special effects that don’t disappoint. The ﬁrst ﬁlm
set a new standard for special effects. Until the sequel,
only the two “Lord of the Rings” ﬁlms have matched
those effects. Indeed, “The Matrix Reloaded” owes a
great deal to both the ﬁrst “Matrix” and the advance-
ments made by the effects wizards working on “The
Lord of the Rings,” but it takes that work to a new level.

Take the ﬁght between Neo and Agent Smith (Hugo
Weaving) near the middle of the ﬁlm. What starts as a

match between two people quickly escalates into a man

versus army battle that is truly a sight to behold. From
the gravity—defying acrobatics of Neo and the multiple
Smiths all moving independently while attacking Neo,
to the incredible climax of the ﬁght, this set piece is a
wonderful accomplishment of modern special effects
and wouldn’t be possible without the advancements
made in “The Two Towers.” R

. There’s a lot to like in “The Matrix Reloaded.” From
the special effects achievements and the intelligence of
the ﬁlm, to the ﬁne performances from all the principle
players, this ﬁlm is well worth the four-year wait.

It’s an emotional ride

Year of the Spider
Cold

Geffen Records
7.“ni‘r1/2

Evidently, 2003 is the Year of the Spider, as Cold show
that they can stand strong after the release of their success-
ful sophomore album, Thirteen Ways to Bleed on Stage.
This strength is proven through every song on their third
release since they broke into the music scene in 1998.

The release of this newest album from the dark, emo-
tional band has been anticipated for some time now. The
ﬁrst single, “Stupid Girl,” the lyrics for which were written
by record label-mate Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, has
received frequent airplay on major alternative radio stations
across the nation. ’

A Year of the Spider is an emotional roller coaster ﬁlled
with anguish, as well as a sentimental look into the life of
frontman Scooter Ward

“Cure My Tragedy (A Letter to God)” is one of the
album’s most emotional tracks, because Ward is singing
about his sister and the time they spent growing up. It’s also
a gut-wrenching plea asking God to take away his sister’s
pain and cure her cancer. Ward sings, “Won’t you take and
give her pain to me ’cause my whole life I made mistakes.”

“Wasted Years” is a song about being 30, looking back
on your life and seeing that it was wasted drinking in bars.
It’s about the time that has gone, years you can’t change,
but you wish you could.

“Black Sunday” is another emotional song, written for
Ward’s girlfriend, who lost a baby six years ago. The child
succumbed to sudden infant death syndrome just two
weeks after being born. It’s a song that tries to help ease the

V sadness that she still feels.

“The Day Seattle Died” pays homage to Kurt Cobain
and Layne Staley, who both died on April 5; it is a song
about how important music, especially tragic music, can be

to people.

Throughout this album, each track screams with pain
that strikes deep into your heart as you listen to every word
that Ward pours out of his. Year of the Spider is a success-
ful follow-up to the previous two albums and is a must for
the record collection.

You were dust and to dust you shall return

It was midway through season
three when I realized that “Buffy the
Vampire Slayer” was the greatest thing
I would ever watch. Sure, there could
be even greater things to witness: the
return of Jesus Christ, a from—beyond-
the-grave Beatles reunion, a from-
beyond—the—grave Beatles/Christ jam
session. I’ll most likely not live to see
any of these. I’ll settle for being alive
to watch Buffy.

The timeline of “Buffy the Vampire
Slayer” almost paralleled my own, and
the show has become so entwined with
my life that, when it ends next week, it
will feel like the death of a friend.
Along the way, it has provided me with
countless laughs, tears and life lessons.

My introduction to “Buffy” came
via my father. He’d read about it and
thought I might enjoy it. A new show,
“Dawson’s Creek,” created enough
buzz for Pittsburgh’s TCI cable to pick
up The WB in 1998. With it came sea-
son two of “Buffy.”-

I began watching season two casu— -

ally, missing a couple episodes here
and there, but by the end of the year, I
was watching consistently. Although I
missed the season finale, I anticipated
the season-three premiere.

With season three, I became
addicted. At the time, Buffy and her
friends were one year ahead of me in
high school, so watching the show
became a glimpse into the future. I

came to relate to each episode, so much
so that I would count the days between
episodes. My rabid interest caused my
dad and even my sister to watch it, a
major accomplishment, considering
her incredible apathy towards televi-
sion.

By the summer, in between seasons
three and four, my mom had seen a few
episodes and Buffy became occasional
dinner conversation. This ‘was also the
summer in which the episode
“Earshot” finally aired. Pulled from
normal rotation because of the
Columbine tragedy, this episode saw
Buffy gain the ability to read high
school students’ minds. I felt this was
one of the most amazing and emotion-
al displays I’ve ever seen. V

Season four brought the spin—off
show “Angel” and the FX syndication
of “Buffy,” which doubled my Tuesday

up on season one. Every week, I would
religiously park myself in front of the
tube for two hours, totally engrossed. I

. wouldn’t even take phone calls. Season

four was about Buffy going to college
and that struckan emotional cord with
me, since I was just taking my SATs.
That season’s finale made my trip -to
Pitt easier to prepare for.

Season ﬁve killed Buffy’s charac-
ter off and ended the show’s WB run.
For me, it also killed the way I would
watch the show. By season six, I was
living in Tower B, which didn’t carry

Buffy’s new network, UPN. I was dev- '

astated. After a month of calling Pitt’s
public relations department and AT&T
cable, I was getting nowhere. My dad
came to the rescue. He agreed to tape
each episode on Tuesday andvdeliver
them to me on Thursday, assuring that I
wouldn’t miss an episode. up

For season seven, I moved off carn-
pus and into an apartment that received

‘UPN. That brings me to where I am

now, sliding downhill towards Buffy’s
ﬁnal demise. It hasn’t really sunk in
yet, but I’m sure next year there will be
a huge hole in my television lineup and
television soul. I’m just happy that it
lasted long enough to get me this far.
Some things are only there just to get
you by, and “Buffy” did that when I
needed it. Now, I’ll just have to slay my
demons on my own.

Through June 15

‘Mattress Factory

500 Sampsonia Way
(412) 231-3169

The Mattress Factory is honest in say-
ing that the “Gestures” series has been a
g-amble for the past two years.

“Openness to chance and a deterrnina—
tion to be as inclusive as possible have
marked our selections over the past two
years,” reads the introduction to the ﬁfth and
ﬁnal Gestures exhibit, which —- like the oth-

Tattooing” and Sam Pace’s “stairway to
heaven/exorciser” border on performance
art. The former consists of elaborate tattoos
being drawn on the skin of people, the latter
is an instrument constructed from
Stairmaster pedals and discarded pipe organ
pipes, with an accompanying performance.

At the opening, two people dressed as
raggedy angels entered the gallery. As one
pedaled, making crude organ sounds, the
other held out slices of angel food cake.
Meanwhile, a computer to their right
showed random numbers on the screen. The
art, as is so often the case, could be seen as
anything, from a profound statement on the
random and demanding nature of religion to
the merely bizarre

But the Mattress Factory has gotten
good at playing the dice game of modern art;
For 20 years, it has consistently exhibited
thought—proVoking, highly creative works
that are above the straight weirdness that is
par for the installation course. And Gestures
is perhaps the most shining testament to that
consistent excellence.

David Wallace’s “Graces Can Be
Grown” is a powerful sculpture-collage
formed from a female mannequin; a bird’s
nest provided the head, a huge painting of
pelvic bones depicted the wings, and cloth‘-
ing irons were chained to its legs.

Wallace’s work is set up well by Todd

Swan’s “Lamplight,” which brings together .

art and interior design in the conﬁned area of
a tight corridor.

Both are followed notably by a dark
room‘ with Hiro Miura’s “DO NOT DIS-
TURB” and James Church’s “Cold
Comfort.” The ﬁrst is a door behind which
Miura has placed receipts on a mat and the
second is a wooden cabinet with bottles
filled with noxious metaphorical ‘medicine,
both sobering indictments of a culture
increasingly obsessed with intrusion and
sterilization.

The piece that stands out above the oth-
ers, though, is JoAnne Bates’ “Sunday

Hedwig and the Angry Inch
Through June 15

Directed by Brad House

City Theatre

(412) 431 -CITY

ikvkikik

Music hath no better inspiration than a woman
scorned penning the tunes. Raw, bitter emotion com-
bines with pleading ballads to form the soundtrack
for City Theatre’s current main-stage production,
“Hedwig and the Angry Inch.”

The production itself is part monologue
and part introspective soliloquy set to a
predominately punk-rock’ soundtrack.
Anthony Rapp, who originated the role

Hedwig, the he—tumed-a1most—she
following a botched sex—change
operation. And the title says it
all: she isn’t happy about it.

John Cameron Mitchell’s
Obie Award-winning script has
been modified to ﬁt Pittsburgh
standards. Allow me to explain. The way the
script is written, you are actually watching a
concert performance of Hedwig’s Band, appro-
priately named The Angry Inch, rather than a the-
ater piece.

Thus, Hedwig tells her
life story between’
songs.
She was
born Hansel
and endured
a tortured
adolescence
as she attempted
to ﬁnd her other
half. He turned out
to be the American
soldier who inspired
her to get the operation
in the first place, because
he couldn’t marry a man.

This begins Hedwig’s
downward spiral as far as rela-

to ex-boyfriend Tommy Gnosis,
the undiscovered dork turned rock
sensation overnight, thanks, in part,
to Hedwig’s help. Finally, we
come to the twisted relationship
with backup singer Yitzak fr
(Sara Siplak). From time to
time, slides pop up on a white
canvas to aid in telling the tale:
Hedwig frequently looks out
the door of the fictitious Bingham
Street Methodist Church turned
music venue, to Heinz Field where
Gnosis is simultaneously perform-
ing. She talks of Edgar Snyder,
Rick Santorum’s recent public
faux pas, and limo rides through
the Strip district. ,

Brian Spamer tries to leg out a single during action earlier this season. Spamer belted two home runs in Pitt’s 14-13
victory over Virginia Tech, in the second game of a doubleheader on Saturday. ’

Panthers fall to Duquesne

RYAN FALooN
Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team had a disappoint-
ing experience in its ﬁrst—eVer game at PNC
Park, against hometown rival Duquesne but,
by winning a series over Virginia Tech last
weekend, the Panthers (35-18 overall, 12-11
Big East) are still capable of sliding into the

fourth and ﬁnal spot for the Big East

Championship.

Duquesne 2, Pitt 1

After blowing out the Dukes 14-4 earli-
er this season at home, it was expected to be
an easy win for the Panthers in the ﬁrst—ever
collegiate game held at PNC Park

Pitt struck ﬁrst by scoring in the third
inning. After Alex Rybczak doubled, an
error by Duquesne’s John Reig allowed him
to score. Things went well for the Panthers
early, but they were unable to produce much
more. . . ’

Duquesne’s Chad Wﬂlianis tied ﬂue
game in the seventh inning with a solo home
run to left ﬁeld The Dukes added the ‘win-

ningruninthebottomoftheninth,onan

inﬁeld single.
The Panthers’ offense, which had been
struggling, continued to be unproductive.

Rybczak’s double was the only extra-base
hitofﬂiegameand, as ateam, Pittonlyput
togeﬂier ﬁve hits.

Virginia Tech 4, Pitt 3

After the Panthers jumped to a 1-0,

advantage in the bottom of the ﬁrst inning,
the Hokies quickly responded by scoring
three runs of their own in the top of the sec-
ond

The Pitt otfense struck back to tie the
game in the ﬁfth inning by scoring two runs
on RBIs by Ben Copeland and Rykaceski.
But once again, the Panthers’ olfense was
held scoreless for the remainder of the game.

Pitt totaled only ﬁve hits on the day,
continuing a team batting slump. Virginia
Tech picked up the winning run in the sev-
enth inning, just before the departnre of Nick
Evangelista, Pitt’s losing pitcher on the day.

Pitt 14, Virginia Tech 13

Game two of Saturday’s doubleheader
was much more exciting as the Panthers’
bats cameback to life. After trailing 4-0 in
the bottom of the ﬁrst inning, Bryan Spamer
cut the lead in half with a two-nm homer.

The Hokies’ lead jumped back to four,
at 6-2, in the second inning, but the Panthers
tied it up in the third when Spamer hit his

second homer of the day, a three—run Shot,
and Tom Cashman added a solo homer.

The Panthers got their ﬁrst lead in the
fourth, scoring three runs, including an RBI
double from Spamer. The lead stretched to
12-7 when Rykaceski ripped a three-rim shot
in the ﬁfth, and Pitt never looked back

Overall, in the second game, the
Panthers produced 18 hits, including four
each by Spamer and Rykaceski. The Pitt
offense responded after a serious drought in
recent weeks.

Pitt 17, Virginia Tech 16

The series came to an end Sunday after
another game ﬁlled with high-powered
offense from both teams.

The Panthers led by as many as ten, up
13-3 on the Hokies in the ﬁfth inning. But
Virginia Tech fought hard and cut the lead to
13-9 in the sixth.

Inthe ninth, winning 16-11, Pitt blew its
lead, allowing ﬁve runs to tie the game. But
in the bottom of the inning, Cashman hit a
solo shot to right ﬁeld for the gaine—winning
run.

After a doubleheader against Canisius
today, Pitt will wrap up regular season play
with a three-game series at Connecticut this
weekend

 

Baseball

belongs in .

the Capital

"T h e
Montreal Expos
have gone ﬁom V
possibly being
contracted by
Major League
Baseball to relo-
cating to one of
three places.

Wow,whata Sponrs Viaw

diﬁerence a year

 

makes. Just 21 K6 'nN ‘h
year ago, MLB , V1 as
was talking

about getting rid of the team, and now it
recognizes the Expos’ worth.

It’s a good thing that Bud Selig and
company decided to hold off on their deci-
sion concerning Montreal and other small-
market teams. The Minnesota Twins were
in the same boat as the Expos, because
there was also talk of contraction surround-
ing that franchise.

Now that it appears that the Expos will
live to play another day, where should they
go;?. There have been proposals for the
Expos to relocate in Washington, D.C.,
Northern Va. or Portland, Ore.

Portland has  a $150 million
package to ﬁnance a stadium, but I just
can’t see baseball in Portland. It doesn’t
seem like a place where a baseball franchise
would take off. No offense to anybody
from Oregon, but a struggling franchise
needs to move to a place that is a “baseball
town.”

Somewhere that has a New York or
Los Angeles feel to it is, where a sports
franchisewould thrive. So, that said,
Portland is out. -. .

There has been a proposal for a $400
mil1ion—dollar stadium somewhere in
Northern Virginia The stadium would be
partly funded by $285 million dollars in
bonds.

Northern Virginia is a more viable
option, with Richmond close by and
Washington not too far, either. But once
again, Noithem Virginia seerris to be miss-
 big-city feel to it Maybe this is why
there has not been a major league team in
Virginia. ,

Let’s look at the place that has had a
major league team and has other sports
franchises.

Despite conﬂictwith Orioles, Senators need to return to MLB      p

u'—:

Nash, page 11 ._

Washington would be the perfect place
for the Expos to start over. Our nation’s cap-
ital has proposed a $338 million dollar
package in which $275 million would go
toward building a new stadium and $15
million would go toward renovating RFK
Stadium. '

I spent most of last summer working in
Washington, and the people seemed
pumped about the possibility of getting
another baseball franchise. I would be too, if
I had been deprived of having a team for
over 30 years. The Senators, who are cur-
rently the Texas Rangers, were the baseball
franchise in Washington until 1972.

The Expos are an up-and-coming ball
club and have the second—best record in the
National League. Montreal has built a foun-
dation with outﬁelder Vladimir Guerrero,
second baseman Jose Vidro and pitchers
Javier Vazquez and Zach Day.

So, as long as the team continues to
build, they should be competitive and draw
interest in years to come.

Washington is thriving with, business

opportunities and is a proven “sports town.” .

It has the Redskins, Wizards and Capitals.
Why not restore the District by returning its
baseball team. a

Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos
is not happy about the possibility of a move
because he feels that it could reduce the rev-

enue of the Orioles by a projected 4 percent.

Guess what, Mr. Angelos? If you spend
the money to put a decent product on the
ﬁeld, you might have less to worry about.

Washington has suifered long enough,
and Splitting games between Montreal and
Puerto Rico can’t last forever. There are
middle school players who can hit a home
11111 at the stadium in Puerto'Rico.

Furthermore, Washington has the best
marketing possibilities and probably the
best fan base. Look «for the Washington
Senators to rejoin the leaguein the near
future.
