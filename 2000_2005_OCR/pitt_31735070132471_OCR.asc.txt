Giuliani addresses
terrorism, politics

“Irealizedthatwas the safest day ofmy
life. I couldn’t stop it without knowing about
it,” he explained. ,

Giuliani also discussed leadership,
which also happens to be the title of his
recent book

“You have to know what you believe
in,” he said, describing Ronald Reagan and
Martin Luther King Jr. as examples of ~ lead-
ership. I '

The former New York mayor also held
optimism in high regard. On the morning of
“those tenible attacks,” Giuliani recalled the
leadership of Winston Churchill, the prime
minister of the United Kingdom during
World War II.

“At the time, I didn’t lmow if we were
going to be attacked again the next day, or
the next day, or the next week I tried -to think
of how Churchill kept his people’s spirits up
when they were being bombed every.day,?’
Giuliani said. ‘ -

When asked to describe his biggest
. challenge in cleaning up New York City,
 said, “The hardest part  getting

From dealing. with organized crime to
cancer to terrorism, Ame1ica”s Mayor dis-
cussed what he believes made him who he is
today. And with two thousand pairs of eyes

ﬁxed intently’ upon him, Rudy  pre— _

sented his vision for the country’s future.

During his visit to Pittsburgh on
Wednesday, Giuliani described how prob-
lems in his personal life gave him experience
to deal with the unexpected — like Sept. 11,
2001. i

“People always ask me if things are
more dangerous now [after Sept. 11],”
Giuliani said. He went on to explain that
Americans are safer because they know
about the problems that led to the attack

Though he described modern acts of

« terrorism dating back to the 1972 Olympics

at Munich, Giuliani expressed the belief that

Americans did too little about terrorism-

before Sept. 11, 2001, because they didn’t
know about it.

In April of 2000, Giuliani was diag-
nosed with prostate cancer.

Tequila shouldbe unique to Mexico

Mexico wants its tequila and, there-
fore, is trying to claim the right to be the
sole bottler of that liquor.

But U.S. bottlers are trying to worm
their way out of this change —— citing
the North American Free Trade
Agreement as evidence that Mexico
does not have jurisdiction over its
exports. -

Apparently, tequila has warped the
bottlers’ vision, causing them to assert
that NAFTA was put in place for the
United States’ beneﬁt only, excluding
Canada and Mexico.

As Mike Griesser,,vice chairman of
McCormick Distilling Co., an American
tequila distributor said, in a» Sept. 25

Associated Press article, “This is a jobs '

issue.”

Since this is mostly a jobs issue,
Mexico has the right to try to boost its
economy through promoting its national
product.

Previously, tequila was imported in
bulk from Mexico and bottled in places
like Kentucky, Arkansas and Missouri,
clearly famous for their tequila—bottling
prowess. If the changes the Mexican
government wants to enact are put in
place, all tequila will be made and bot-
tled in Mexico. -

Will this lead to a tequila dry—out,
with salt—less hands and lime—less lips
on campuses nationwide? Will Jimmy
Buffet start singing odes to the lesser
liquors? Wasting away in amaretto-

burgh just doesn’t have that ring to it.

No worries, though. Ending “bulk
shipments” just means tequila will come
in bottles rather than larger containers.
Whether or not there will be a price—hike
remains to be seen, considering that the
Mexican government will not issue its
official rule until next month.

But so far, Mexico’s aim seems to
be merely improving its product, which
will bolster its economy. And wasn’t
that NAFTA’s original intent — eco-
nornic Viability for the three countries
involved? .

Will jobs be lost in the United States
as a resultof this decision? Probably,
but since the companies already own
bottling equipment, surely there are
other liquors available to bottle. Much
of the liquor imported into the United
States is done in bulk, and prohibition
doesn’t look like —it’s returning anytime
soon.

It should be noted that other coun-
tries have trademarked alcohols, like
champagne and cognac, which are
unique to certain French regions. In fact,
the European Union is currently peti-
tioning to protect these products as geo-
graphically speciﬁc.

Mexico has a vested interest in pro-
moting a product internationally recog-

nized as being solely from that country. —

Just as France claims Champagne, and
Canada claims curling, Mexico should
be allowed to claim tequila.

Textbook writers: freaky subculture?

There are a lot of people living

in this world. A whole lot. All dif-

ferent types of people. Most are
similar enough to each other and
make up some sortiof “normal”
demographic.

But I am not here to argue about
whether or not such a thing as “nor—
mal” exists. What I do know is that
there are plenty of groups of people
who are somehow abnormal. _

Call them subcultures, ‘if you
will. They aren’t _necessarily ‘any
better or worse than any other
group of._people, merely
different, ﬂying under
the radar of the public
eye‘.

There are people who '
like dressing in giant
furry costumes, people
who get together to
smoke mysterious sub-
stances and people who
are really, really into
piercings.

And then there are
the people who write
textbooks. , _ V

Textbook writers have got to be,
unequivocally, the flat-out oddest
people on the planet. Not all of
them, of course.

Some are perfectly functional‘
human beings, I’m sure. But others

. are not. They can’t be. Not with the

sort of stuff they’ve been sneaking
into my books. I. ’

I first noticed something was
amiss while reading my high school
environmental science text. A cer-
tain man by the name of G. Tyler
Miller penned my particular book,
which I believe was his eighth or
ninth edition of the text. '

Miller’s books contained useful
information like, “In fact, without
water, the earth would have no

oceans.” As if this information was-
n’t mind—expanding enough, he
offered review topics such‘ as,
“Congratulations. . You have just
been put in charge of the world.
List the five most important fea-
tures of your urban policy” and
“Imagine that you are an igneous
rock. Act as a reporter and send in a
‘written report on what you experi-

ence as you move through various 6

parts of the rock cycle.”

What kind of person would_

write that? A sane one? One. with
-social skills? I doubt it.

And now, doing my
homework like a, good
student, I find that Miller
is not alone. ‘ K

The editors of my
linguistics textbook
, chose to include an exer-
cise to “Find Out More
About English Vowels,”
which is a legitimate
‘ thing, since linguistics is
all ‘about letters and
sounds and whatnot.

They‘ recommended
finding a friend to repeat a sound
over and over while you back away
from‘ said friend until you can no
longer hear his or her voice —
again,7nothirI,g wrong with this sug-
gestion. .

What makes me wonder about
the sanity of this group ‘of peopleisv
the advice they placed, in parenthe-
ses, in the middle of the. paragraph:

, “Don’t do this exercise on a first.

in the entire world who was seri-
ously considering asking out that

,tors by suggesting the two of them,

THE PITT NEWS

Listening required in a free speech society

On Labor Day, 2002, President
Bush made an appearance on
Neville Island, outside Pittsburgh.
Retired steelworker Bill Neel, 65,
was there to voice his opinion,
holding a sign that read, “The Bush
family must surely love
the poor. They have
made so many of us.”He
planned to show this
sign, no larger than a
folded newspaper, as the
presidential motorcade’
passed. Instead, he was
asked to move to a spe-

speech zone” reserved
for protestors. When he
refused, he was arrested
and charged with disor-

derly conduct.

District Justice Shirley” Rowe
Trkula later threw out the case/,
reminding those present that “This
is America.” But Neel’s case wasn’t
unique. ’

On September 24, the American
Civil Liberties Union filed a law-
suit in federal court, claiming the
Secret Service and local law

enforcement had forced protestors

into similar, ironically named “free-
speech ’_'zones” at presidential
appearances around the country.
Meanwhile, Bush supporters were
allowed to remain with the general
crowd.

The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, in
an editorial published just after
Neel’s arrest, compared him to
abortion clinic protestors, defend-
ing his right to free speech while

‘denying him any “right to get in the
. face of those they are protesting

against.”

The Post—Gazette forgets that
Neel was trying to convey his mes-
sage to anelected official, someone
who ultimately answers to the peo-
ple, unlike an abortion doctor.

. Neel wouldn’t be anywhere
close to Bush’s face, but the Post-

 

Jesse Hicks
Columnist '

Gazette editorial duly invokes the
spectre of Sept. 11, 2001, in claim-
ing that the need for presidential
security justifies creating such
pockets of free speech.

Are they really claiming that
someone clever enough
to smuggle a weapon past
the Secret Service and
get close to the President
wouldn’t be smart
enough to sport a pro-
Bush sign? ’ A

Maybe more disturb-
ing than a media outlet’s
support of such free
speech limitations —— I
mean, wefve pretty much
gotten used to the media
trumpeting the party line,
haven’t we? — is what
Bush’s apparent aversion to dissent
says about politics in this country.

We talk about free_ speech, but
then forget how to listen. Bush
probably doesn’t want to hear about
how his policies are, in the eyes of
many, hurting average Americans.
Does that mean he shouldn’t have
to hear? No, because he has a
responsibility to know all the facts.

If you could easily characterize
political discussion \ in America
these days, itiwould be two angry
faces yelling past each other. I once
saw a gun-control advocate and a

gun owner “debate” with each other .

for over an hour. They were at the
shooting range and had forgotten to
take their ear protection out. Not
that it really mattered, because nei-
ther knew how to actually listen to
the other.

Somehow, even with our hun-
dreds of media outlets, it’s only
gotten easier to remain uninformed.
Mostly, this is -because human
beings naturally seek out those with
whom they agree. So for the right-
wing neo—conservatives, there’s Fox
News and Ann Coulter. For the
slightly less conservative, there’s

CNN. These people will all tell you
what you already believe to be true,
smiling beatifically while reaffirm-
ing all your prejudices.

And on»the~ left, there’s Michael
Moore and Al Franken. Moore is
the sloppier _of the two, while
Franken is actually funny.‘ Neither
of_ them, though, could be consid-
ered voices of reason; Franken has
specifically positioned himself as
the leftist answer to Ms. Coulter
and Bill O’Reilly. Not that there
doesn’t need to be an answer to
those two, but do two opposite
poles catering to the true believers
of either extreme really add up to an
informed discussion?

and his shouting matches make for
great television. Viewers write in
all the time, congratulating Bill on
really sticking it to those eggheads
who try to talk. The recent
California ’ recall debate wasn’t
much better, with every candidate
trying for‘ pressure points that
would silence the other contenders.

Yes, it’s all very entertaining,
and maybe that’s all we want from
our leaders.

But at some point, when we’ve
reached that magical, enforced con-
sensus by silencing all our critics,
maybe we’ll wonder how we got to
this point, and why.

There’s something sad and dis-
turbing about people willing to live
in a bubble of their own ideas. That
bubble is actually a vacuum, a place
where thought and debate are
impossible.

In the end, while we may be
guaranteed the right to free speech,
to be good citizens we’re also sad-
dled with its corollary responsibili-
ty: the responsibility to listen.

“What party? There’s no party. Try the
house down the street. ”-

—Seann William Scott, “American '
Pie”

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26 , 2003

Earlier this week, I took a drive out to the “
Century III Mall to get some pictures devel-
opecLInthehourIhadtokillbetweendrop-
ping off my ﬁlm and picking up my pictures,
I thought it would be a good idea to check out
the new Salvation Army store up the street
from the mall. -

Going into the store, I thought I might
ﬁnd a cool T-shirt or two and, if I were lucky,
a new sport jacket. And while the store was a
bit underwhelming — the Goodwill on the
South Side has a much larger selection — I
walked out of the Salvation Army store with
something I never thought I would ﬁnd; the
Power Glove for the original Nintendo
Entertainment System

The NES was the coolest thing in my life
when I was a kid. I would come home from school and ﬁre
up "Ihe Legend of Zelda” and hope my brother hadn’t
erased my game. Or I would pull out the ‘ etris” or “Super

T

Mario Bros. 3” cartridges, put them into the system and, .

when they didn’t work, blow into the cartridge to get the dust
out. It was a good time, and a lot of homework was put off
in the hours between coming home from school and waiting
for my mom to clean up after dinner.

But there was always something missing from my NES.
Sure, I had some cool games —— though I never had
“Metroid,” “Ninja Gaiden,” “Excitebike” or “Contra,”
games I always wanted — and there was a time when I had
more cartridges than most kids my age, but I never had the
accessories. I never had the Zapper gun, the NES Advantage

 «s

As the years passed,
I’ve pulled my still—functioning
NES out and jumped back into
the battle for the Triforce. I’ve
also come across games I’ve always wanted at secondhand
stores like Goodwill —— I now have most of the gamesyl
longed for as a kid, with the exception of “Contra, ” “Punch
Out” and “Ninja Gaiden.” But, more importantly, I’ve ﬁlled
out my NES by picking up a light gun —— one of the newer,
red ones; although I’m still on the lookout for the original
gray gun — and my biggest catch to date, the inﬁnitely awe-
some Power Glove. 1 ,

As cool as it was, though, to ﬁnd the Power Glove, it
bluntly reminded me how video games now can’t compete
with games from the ‘80s and early ‘90s. Sure the
PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube have neat graphics and
irnmersive garneplay, but where’s their Power Glove or
Advantage joystick? ’ '

PAGE 6

Video games have become so over the top that they’re
visually oppressive, with disorienting three-dimensional
worlds and, at times, seizure-inducing ﬂashing screens.
When I play video games, I want to enjoy them '— some-
thing that can’t be done if you’re preoccupied thinking in 3-
D, 128-bit terms and trying to avoid becoming physically ill.

Worse than that, video game companies now don’t give

gamers anything to allow them to participate in the game ’

outside of pressing buttons on a joystick Ifyou’re making a
ﬁrst-person shooter game, like “Doom” or “Metroid Prime,” .
provide a gun that hooks into the system that makes the game
more interactive. Or with ﬁghting games, give us an equiva-
lent of the Power Glove. . , .

Video games now are much more advanced than they
were when I was an 8-year-old in an eight-bit world But
when I was eight, video game companies like Nintendo were

much more creative in getting people into their product. I

There wasn’t going to be some great techno1ogicall)reak-
through every two years that they could package to cus-
tomers. It took more than a decade to go from eight to 16 bits,

so they had to give kids the Power Glove, a Zapper gun and . ‘

Rob the Robot to keep people coming back for more.

Sure, you could look at these things as crass marketing "
ploys to get more money out of a video garne-hungry popu-
lation.-But that Power‘ Glove is one neat device. And after ‘I
bought it at the Salvation Army, ripped it out of its plastic-bag

conﬁnement, and put it on, /I felt like that eight-year-old kid

again. It’s too bad my little brother, who has grown up with j
the Playstation, Drearncast and GameCube —— systems that ‘I
don’t offer any novelty other than little shiny discs —— won’t
be able to experience the same thing. - ’

Directed by Peter Berg

Strobe lights, loud driving music, big
guns and even bigger hand-to—hand ﬁghting
sequences make ‘The Rundown” an intense
action ﬂick The movie gainsrnomentum at
the beginning and doesn’t let up until the last
man has hit the ground. Tight, close shots set
the scene before the action just explodes.

“The Rundown” is a story about bad

guys and really bad guys. Beck (the Rock) is ~

fed up with his current job — which
involves tracking people down and taking
what they owe his boss —— and is desperate
to quit so he can start a restaurant.
Unforumately, quitting is not as easy as
putting in his two weeks notice. Beck has
one last job he needs to complete before he

can walk away. He has to go to the Amazon '

jungle to ﬁnd Travis (Seann Wﬂliarn Scott),
his boss’ son, and bring him back home to
LA. Of course, this task is anything but sim-
ple.

Guns take Beck to a place he doesn’t
want to go, but that doesn’t prevent everyone
else from having them. However, they rarely
get a chance to ﬁre at Beck before he kicks
them in the head or knocks them out with his
ingenious moves. The action, though unreal-
istic, is entertaining to watch. The ﬁght’
choreography is clever and the characters
utilize every object nearby, from tumtables
to swinging vines on trees.

Each actor brings his or her own kind of
humor to the movie. Seann Wrlliarn Scott
doesn’t quite move past his Stiﬂer days from
the “American Pie” trilogy, but he still has
plenty of amusing lines. It is hard to keep a
straight face while watching his character try
to hold his own in all of the ﬁghts.

The Rockis best when throwing people
to the ground, but he has his own comedic
lines, in a straight man sort of way.
Christopher Walken, though, really brings
comedy to this action ﬁlm, playing the over-

lordat the gold mine in the Amazon. His qui-
etly delivered lines and the wit he brings to
his character are truly hilarious in the movie.

“The Rundown” is an enjoyable, loud
and exciting movie that won’t disappoint

fans of the action genre. The movie has some.
expected turns, yet provides a couple of

twists to keep the audience engaged. Being ‘

trapped and chased down in the Amazon
jungle was never more fun.

T here’s just something romantic about that Italian sunset

Under the Tuscan Sun
Starring Diane Lane, Sandra
Oh, Lindsay Duncan, Raol
Bova, Vincent Riotta
Directed by Audrey Wells
ﬁsh 1/2 5

ASHLEY WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

“Under the Tuscan Sun,” from
director Audrey Wells, is based on
the best—selling memoir of the same
title by Frances Mayes. Diane Lane
plays Frances, a recently divorced
book critic. Trying to help Frances
out of her post—breakup heartache,
friend Patti (Sandra Oh) offers a
gift she hopes will do the trick. It is
a ticket to Tuscany, Italy. What

begins as an unwanted vacation.

turns into a new life when Frances,
on a whim, buys a dilapidated villa.

Frances’ enthusiastic realtor
(Vincent Riotta) and a team of
Polish handymen join heras reno-
vations begin on “Bramasole,”
which aptly means “something that
yearns for the sun.” As the house
becomes a home, Frances adapts to
life as a single American in Italy.
She finds herself forming friend-
ships with the people around her,
slowly rediscovering herself in the

r" '

serremiaeii 

.3-II"; 

process. When a chance encounter
leads her into the arms of handsome
Marcello (Raoul Bova), Frances
steps into a whirlwind romance
that, if unsuccessful, may break her
for good.

With her heart on her sleeve and
fear in her throat, she pursues what
she desires above all else — mar-
riage and a family. She has yet to
learn the lesson vocalized by eccen-
tric friend Katherine (Lindsay
Duncan) —— only when you stop
looking for what you desire will
you find it.

While the film is entertaining
and sincere, by the end, the viewer
is left with a “haven’t I seen this
before?” feeling. Cliched represen-
tations of love run amok. Certain
scenes feature landscapes that are
almost unreal in their beauty; we
are meant to feel that, because the
world looks beautiful andhappy,
our protagonist is happy as well.

Wells uses other methods to
continually hit the viewer over the
head with her “underlying” message
of the pursuit of happiness in the
face of intimidating odds. A sun-
ﬂower and light motif is associated
with Tuscany, giving it an atmos-
phere of hope. For any doubt that
may remain as to what Frances

' A big question mark has found a
home next to the Pitt defense, fol-
lowing the Panthers 35-31 loss to
Toledo last.Saturday.

Sophomore quarterback Bruce
Gradkowski beat the Pitt defense in

‘ the air, throwing for 461 yards in the

game. The numbers for the young
quarterback were enough to make
critics wonder about the Panthers --

’ Like Gradkowski, Reggie
McN,eal, the Aggies’ quarterback, is
yourfg and lacks experience, -but
shows no signs of it on the field.
McNeal takes a different
approach to the quarte_rback position
than any the Panthers have seen thus
far. Considered one of the nation’s
fastest quarterbacks, McNeal likes
to beat‘ teams with his speed and
agility. ' A .
_“Their quarterback, Reggie
McNeal, is a completely different
athlete than anyone we’ve faced

The Panthers (2-1) ~face_ yet

because he’s so fast and he can run,”
Pitt head coach Walt Harris said.
The Texas A&M offense was
originally controlled by Dustin
Long, a senior ,quarterback, who
started last season. However, at 6

feet 2 inches and 195 lbs.,' McNeal 

came in this season and beat out the
former starter with his 4.3 speed in
the 40-yard dash. , .

“He is, the fastest guy on the

team,” Harris -said. “No question.’

We have never played against any-
one as fast as he is. You have to put
a hook on him.”

In its first three games this sea-
son, Pitt’s defense has yet to allow a"

team to rush for 100 yards in a

game, and is giving up as average of
only 85 yards per game on the
ground. a , —
Offensively for the,Pan.thers,
this may be running back Brandon

Franchione had their‘ differences at
Alabama, resulting in Miree’s trans-

The Aggies have not been suc-
cessful this season at stopping the
run. Their defense has given up
almost 200 rushing yards per game,
which is to Miree’_s advantage.

a Miree is averaging 4.4 yards per
carry this season for the Panthers.
Additionally, senior fullback

Lousaka Polite has contributed to
the Pitt ground game, averaging 6.7
yards per carry on his nine carries.
The successful running attack of
the Panthers, along with the Aggies’
inability to stop the run, presents a
major advantage for Pitt this week.
However, it is likely that ' the
Panthers will do more than run.

On the play previous to Richards’

gambled and went for it. Van Pelt sensed .

an Aggie blitz and audibled a call, then

dumped the ball over the middleto tight _

end Lionel Sykes, who picked up 12
yards.

“We knew they were a blitzing
team, and we knew we could take
advantage of that,” said Van Pelt, who
threw for 354 yards, breaking Pitt’s sin-

by Dan Marino in 1981. Van Pelt ended

"missing all three two-point conver-

Pitt got the ball back with 4:20
left in the game, and Van Pelt did
what he does best: aired it out. . .

On third and 10 from the Pitt 16,
Sykesmade the catch of the year.

Van Pelt’s pass was swatted away

by the Aggies’ defender Chris
Crooms, but Sykes tipped the ball
back in play with one hand, caught it
with the other hand, and sprinted up
the sideline before. being pushed out
of bounds after" gaining 28 yards.
‘ Six plays later, it was third and
10 again from the A&M 44. Van Pelt
saw something he liked in‘ the Aggie
defense and audibled, sending Henry
Tuten long; Van Pelt heaved a rain-
bow. The ball slitheredthrough the
hands of Aggie defender Kevin Smith
and into Tuten’s around the 12. Tuten
then raced past a stunned Smith for
the winning touchdown.

“You can’t fault Kevin -Smith,”
said Aggie coach R.C. Slocum. “He
was in position; he just didn’t make

the play and [Tuten] did.”

“We were just looking for the

first down,” Van Pelt said. “But they

showed blitz, and the cornerback
bumped up so he could cover Henry
more tightly, so I sent him long.” _.
“There is not much ‘that you can
say [about Van Pelt] that hasn’t been

said all year,” said Hackett. “The
man understands‘ the game. There is
no question where the leadership on

this team is.. It’s square on his shoul-

ders. It showed today.”

Van_ Pelt was selected as the
game’s most valuable player, but
modestly attributed any credit to his
teammates. I .

“I’m just fortunate enough to
play with quality players,” said Van
Pelt. “They’re the ones that made me
look good.” i

A&M had one last chance to
come back, however, and 2:19 to do
it in.

T The Aggies worked the ball up to

their own 47 with 1:08 to go, when '

quarterback Lance Pavlas decided to
try for fie1d—goal position in one play.

One pass was broken up by
Alonzo Hampton, and another was
dropped by tight end Mike Jones. On
third down, Pavlas went deep, but the
pass was snatched by Pitt cornerback
Barry Threats at the Panther 22.

“We weren’t going to let this one
get away for coach Hackett,” said
Threats. ‘ ‘V _

A record held by, Dan Marino was
broken on a last—minute catch for a
winning touchdown to cap a come-
back for a new coach in his first col-
legiate game. ‘

‘ “This was the perfect game to be
on television,” Pitt safety Dan
Crossman said.
