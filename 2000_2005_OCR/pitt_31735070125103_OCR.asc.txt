UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Chancellor reports onstate of University:

I e are not
a mar-
ginal in-
stitution seeking to make our
wayup the middle ranks,” Chan-
cellor Mark A. Nordenberg said.
“We are a strong institution seek-
ing to become one of the best.”
The chancellor assessed the
state of the University for an
audience of about 225 at the
March 22 University Senate ple-
nary session. ' .
Nordenberg reiterated and
elaborated on goals established
by Pitt’s Board of Trustees —

pursuing excellence in _,under- ‘

graduate education; building on
research strengths; increasing

' , overalloperationalefﬁciencyand

community — and said the Uni-
versity had made progress to-
ward meeting each goal.

But two faculty members,re—
sponding to the chancellor’s re-
marks, focused on Nordenberg’s
theme of what it means to be-
“one of the best,” and cautioned
that goals by themselves are not
sufficient benchmarks of a
university’s health without cor-
responding clearly defined and
agreed-upon measurements. (See
story on this page.) ‘

Nordenberg began his ad-
dress, “Pitt in the Year 2000:
Pursuing Our Full Potential,”
with a quote‘ from Clark Kerr,
former chancellor of the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley:
“A reputation, once established,
is an institution’s greatest asset.”

As examples of Pitt’s reputa-
tion, Nordenberg pointed to
membership in the Association
of American Universities (AAU),

. increased federal and state sup-
port, higher enrollments and _

better—qualiﬁed students, and
record fundraising, among other
indicators.

The chancellor said the Uni-
versity boasts a top 20 ranking
among universities nationwide
in attracting science and engi-
neering dollars, a top 10 ranking
in medical researchfunding and
‘a “No. 1 ranking in support from
the National Institute of Mental
Health.

Nordenberg said Pitt was
awarded 175 research grants of
at least $2 5 0,000 between June
and December 1999. “Research
dollars are up almost 30 percent

over the last four years and we ‘

are on par for another 14 percent

addresses March 22 University
Senate plenary session.

Faculty resp

niversity Senate
President Nathan

Hershey asked two

faculty members to respond to
Chancellor Nordenberg’s re-
marks at the March 22 Senate

plenary session. ‘

James G.‘Holland, professor

of psychology and a Pitt faculty
member for 35 years, was asked
to represent senior faculty, and
Jeanette M. Trauth, assistant
‘professor-of health services ad-
ministration in the Graduate
School of Public Health and co-
director of the joint master’s
degree program in health» pro.-
motion and education, was asked

to speak for younger faculty.

, James G. Holland

- Holland drew comparison in
a half-dozen categories between
Edward M. Litchﬁeld’s tenure

‘as chancellor (1956-1965) and

the currentechancellor, by pre-
senting a mock report card.
Noting that Pitt’s Board of
Trustees in 1955 had laid out
similar sounding themes and

goals to those of today’s board, V

Holland gave Litchfield a D
grade and Nordenberg a B+ in
the category of “luck.”

Holland quoted from a 1955
statement: “The trustees have
set forth new goals which, when
realized, will place the Univer-

Patnc/a [Eagle/C/DDE

increase during this year alone, a
remarkable jump,” he said. “The
Universityican import into this
region more than" $300 million,

“Seeking to become one ofthe best”

percentage. increase in state ap-
propriations in recent memory

- and that a $138 million five-year

nearly twice our state appropria- 5‘

tions.”

In addition, Pitt received
from private donors about $65
million in cash last year, a record
amount, and has about $100 mil-
lion in long—term commitments

' as part of the quiet phase of its
capital campaign, which is ex-
pected to be launched this fall.

“This will allow us to en-
hance our undergraduate pro-
grams and research, add to the

endowment, attract top-quality
faculty, attack cost barriers of
students, foster human develop-

 
  

build, even as it enhances the
strengthof the region,” he said.

The chancellor said the Uni-
versity had received the highest

commitment from the state al-
lowed Pitt to embark on “a con-
struction_ program of historic
dimension which will dramati-
cally improve this campus.” Nor-
denberg pointed to the upcom-
ing construction of the Multi-
Purpose Academic Complex and
the Petersen Events Center and
renovation of the Masonic
Temple as examples. ' ‘ ‘

Among Pitt’s‘ highest priori-
ties, Nordenberg said, is im-
provement of undergraduate

education. “High academic am— ’

bition is the defining character-
istic over the entire course of the

he said. “You literally cannot

out running into countless ex-
amples of outstanding individu-
als who began building their ca-

Ior Nordenberg's state of the University address March 22.

sity of Pittsburgh among the
leaders of the world’s great uni-
versities. We are fully aware of
all that this will require-, and we
intend to provide it.”

Holland said the board ap-
parently agreed with Litchﬁeld’s
assessment that “a programof
this magnitude has major ﬁnan-
cial implications. Preliminary

an Ivy League-quality institu-

appraisal would indicate theineed .
for an additional endowment of _

from $90 — $100 million in the
period just ahead,” Litchfield
wrote in accepting the appoint-
ment as chancellor.

But the 1955 Board ofTrust—
ees did not back up the stated
intentions of its chair, Alan M.
Scaife, and the goal to turn Pitt
from a “trolley car university” to

tion fell flat on its face, Holland
said. _ I

“In examining that failure we
might be better prepared for the
dangers ahead for our own at-
tempt ‘to be the best in all we
do,’” Holland said. “After a 10-
year try, the University was broke
and no longer credit—worthy. It
was $20 million in debt. So what
went wrong? First, bad luck. Alan
Scaife died of a heart attack three
years after Litchfield’s appoint-
ment,” Holland said, and the
board never supported Litchfield
after that, allowing the debt to
accumulate.

“The message to us today: Be
lucky,” he said. The current ad-

ministration has been lucky re-

 

reers as Pitt undergraduates.
Fairly or not, our graduate pro-
grams are better known for qual-
ity; in moving ahead, it is essen-
tial to elevate the quality of our
undergraduate programs.”

To reach that goal, the'chan-
cellor said, Pitt must market its
programs and recruit more ef-

- fectively; must better deploy the

financial aid office; and must
make long-term investments in
improving the environment for
students, including classroom
renovations, enhanced technol-
ogy infrastructure and support
of programs like Pitt Arts and
study abroad that maximize stu-
dent academic and personal
growth.

“We must not only admit a ‘

diverse student body, but make
sure that each studentiis fully
positioned to develop his or her
potential. We believe thatzifwe
give all our students the chance
to be the best that they can be,

some of them will become among

-thebestatha-t.:a:nyon_e can be,” he

said. “We must also make op-
portunities fairly available to.all,
including in particular those

cently with the opportunity to»
develop prime real estate on cam-
pus at the Pitt Stadium site, he
said. _
Another lesson for today:
“Have all board members com-

mitted to the goals.” In the cat— ,

egory of “board commitment”
Holland gave Litchfield an Fand
Nordenberg an “incompletc/
wait for mid—term exam,” saying
it was too early to tell ifthe board
would sustain a commitment to
its stated goals. _

In ‘Pitt’s.’ relations with the
community, Holland gave
Litchfield a D grade and Nor-
denberg an A. Litchfield made
“a number of worthy moves,”
Holland said, “but moves car-
ried out with arrogant disregard
for community ‘opinion. The
message for us: Work for the

“mutual benefit of Oakland and

the University,” which he said

Nordenberg had done.
Litchfield earned another F
for “alliance with faculty” for
exerting too much personal con-
trol in academic decision—mak-
ing and for having a top—heavy
administrative structure, Hol-
land said. ‘ -

Lack of shared
governance an
issue here in
debate over
same-sex
benefits

To the editor:

The recent Carnegie Mellon
University report!recommend-
ing that the university amend its
policy on health benefits to in-
clude qualified same-sex couples
underscores the striking differ-
ences in its approach to the ques-
tion as compared to Pitt’s, and
appears to reveal a qualitative
distinction in the cultures ofthe
two institutions. I refer specifi-
cally to the question of shared
governance or, at the very least,
the serious consideration of fac-
ulty and staff opinion in deci-
sion-making. 3 ,

VVhatever one’s stance on the
issue ofsame-sex benefits (and I
am strongly in favor of them),
the contrast between the way in
which CMU has handled the
matter, generating positive pub-
licity for itselfin the process, and
the way Pitt has handled it, gen-
erating seemingly endless nega-
tive publicity in the process, is
profound.

The process at CMU was ini-
tiated by former President
Mehrabian nearly a year ago
when he asked CMU’s Human
Relations Commission to study
the matter. CM U’s HRC, which
was established to explore and
study controversial issues involv-
ing the university community, is
made up ofa chair appointed by
the administration as well as some
other members, with the remain-
der appointed by CMU’s Fac-
ulty Senate and Staff Council.
The H RC also elects a few mem-
bers ofits own. The commission
cannot compel any member of
the university community to do
anything, but relies on the power
of persuasion. In short, it is a
reasonably democratic and rep-
resentative commission intended
to resolve potential conflict
within the university before dam-
age is done.

This approach contrasts
sharply with Pitt’s in this case,
which through the Board of

_Trustees’ actions and those of

certain administrators and out-
side legal advisers, has attempted»
to stonewall the issue, produc-
ing highly unfavorable publicity
and legal expenses in the pro-
cess. Furthermore, it has basi-
cally ignored the recommenda-
tions of the University Senate
affirmative action committee,
and in effect has so far. rejected
the right of faculty and staff to
have a real voice in the matter.
The relatively low cost of ex-
tending benefits to qualified
same—sex couples is surely over-
shadowed by the cost, legal and
moral, ofsuch an approach. But
equally important is the fact that
such behavior violates the rights

of individuals within the Uni— ./

versity and makes a mockery of

the concept of shared gover- ,

nance.

Iuse the term moral advis-
edly, because in the end this is
the nature of the approach taken
by CMU’s HRC. Noting that

people on both sides of the issue i

believe themselves on high moral
ground, and that therefore no
decision will please everyone, the
CMU commission nonetheless
points to tolerance as the central
distinguishing characteristic ofa
great modern university, which
is necessarily “composed ofdif-
ferent ethnic groups, nationali-
ties, religions, colors and; yes,
sexual orientations.” VVhile not
ignoring the practical issues (i.e.
the demonstrably low cost of
such benefits, the removal ofan
important obstacle to hiring and
retaining the best faculty mem-
bers), the recommendation is
based primarily on the concept
of tolerance, which involves com-

pensating all individuals equally ,

for the same work, without preju-
dice as to ‘their sexual orienta-
tion.

Even though I have seen only
a draft copy, I highly recom-
mend the CMU commission’s
report as one ofthe more distin-

guished documents issuing of late

from a university committee of
any kind. It is direct and clear
and even elegant in its trenchant
examination of the issue. The
conclusions are based on consid-
erable nationwide research of
various aspects of the topic, and
positions on all sides are fairly
considered. VVhatev'er the final
outcome at CMU, so far the ap-
proach, while‘ admittedly rather
belated in comparison to other
major Ivy League and important

research institutions with which .

CMU feels competitive, has all
the distinguishing marks of a
great modern university. As the
Gospel says, Qui potest capere
capiat, which I would translate as
“Let s/he who can, compre-

hend.” '

Ken Service, director, Oﬂice ofNews
c'7’ Information, replies:

A comparison between Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon on the subject of
health beneﬁts for the same—sexpart—
ners of employees reveals a much

more significant distinction in in-
stitutional circumstances than it does
in institutional culture.

The most obvious diﬁference is
that Pitt is _a state-related univer-
sity, not a private university like
CM U. While CM U may be free to
ignore the views of the executive
and legislative branches of the Penn-
sylvania government, as a state-
related institution Pitt must con-

sider the actions and views of those -

bodies in setting policies. ..

- v

The legislature has indicated an
unwillingness to expand the legal

deﬁnition of “marriage” to include ,

same-sex relationships and publicly

suggested that appropriations might _

be withheld from state-related in-
stitutions that extended -health-in-
surance beneﬁts to same—sex couples.
A spokesperson for the executive
branch has publicly indicated that
the state government does not oﬁfer
same—sex benefits to its employees,
and so, it would be inappropriate for
a state-related university to contra-
dict that policy.

Another very basic diyﬁrence is

C that for the past four years (about

the same amount of time that the
CM U commission -has been dealing
quietly with this issue) Pitt has been

forced to operate within the con-
straints of a legal action before the
Pittsburgh Human Relations Com-
mission. That proceeding, brought
by aformer writing instructor and
since joined by others, contends that
the city ’s human relations act re-
quires Pitt to provide health insur-
ance benefits to same-sex domestic
partners. The publicity generated
by that action ‘is not “produced” by
the University, but, instead, by those
who would attempt to denigrate the
University so as to distract attention
ﬁom their attempt to use this city
ordinance for purposesfor which it
was never intended.

Interestingly enough, the same
news media that cover these at-
tempts also acknowledge the valid-
ity of the University’s position, as

exempliﬁed by an editorial on the-

issue in the Post-Gazette which
-stated: “[ Wie do not believe that the

' city ’s gay rights- ordinance requires

companies to provide the same ben-

efits to domestic partners that they

provide to spouses. ”

Additionally, it is not accurate
to say that the views of Senate com-
mittees have been “ignored.” Quite
to the contrary, the chancellor has
frequently discussed this issue at
public meetings of the Senate Coun-
cil, as well as in written form in the
Universiq Times and the Post-
Gazette. A

If one feels compelled to make

comparisons about shared gover-

nance, a more valid approach mi ght ,
be to compare institutions of similar I

type and situation, such as Pitt and
Penn State. When the Penn State
faculty petitioned for health benefits
for the same—sex partners of em-
ployees, the Penn State administra-
tion rejected that proposal on the
basis that elected oﬁicials had warned
that the University ’s appropriation

could be in jeopardy. Perhaps recog- .

nizing that the issuetinvolved was
larger than any one institution, the
Penn State faculty turned their ef-
ﬁorts towards changing opinions in
Harrisburg, rather than fruitlessly
‘belittling theirown university. That
might be an example of shared gov-
ernance worthy of some consider-
ation.

That’s whyiher family and’

friends were not surprised when

Mullins, after being diagnosed

. with cancer and-given a poor

prognosis, chose to live out her
days at the Longwood at
Oakmont hospice in Plum.
“During this time,]une char-
acteristically made everyone feel

as good as possible about her '

choice of a peaceful hospice
death. She'made,us feel that she
was physically comfortable and
completely tranquil with her
decision,” her husband, William
Mullins, said in a’ written tribute
to his wife, who died on March
16, 2000.

Mullins, 72, was a faculty
member at Pitt from 1968 until
her retirement 20 years later.

Frieda Hammermeister, who
taught with Mullins in the spe-
cial education department, said:
“June was so very intense in all
that she did, whether it was teach-
ing or pursuing her interests in
the arts, literature, politics and
travel. But most of all, she was an
advocate for disabled peopleand,
in general, individuals who were
disadvantaged.” .

Mullins always kepther of-
fice door open for students,
Hammermeister said.- ‘-‘Every
time I would walk by, I would see
her meeting with someone, of-
ten foreign students and students
with disabilities.”

' A Chicago native, Mullins
received an undergraduate de-
gree in psychology from the
University of Chicago and her
doctorate from Pitt.

‘During World War II, she
worked part-time at the Ortho-
genie School in Chicago, prima-

rily with autistic children. “This
began her life—long commitment
to disadvantaged children,” said

William Mullins, who isnowqa I

retired Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity professor of materials sci-
ence. ~

The couple, who met in the
7th grade, married in 1948. Af-

ter they moved to Pittsburgh,-

June worked part-time at West-
ern Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic and later at the Home for
Crippled Children (now the Re-

habilitation Institute) before

joining the Pitt faculty.

She served on the board of
‘United Cerebral Palsy and wrote
numerous research papers and
_four books, including ‘ “Accept
Me Asl Am,” which she co-
authored with Joan Friedberg
and Adelaide Sukiennik. The
American Librarians Association
named the book as an'outstand-
ing reference work of 1985.

Sukiennik, a retired Pitt fac-
ulty librarian, said: “June was a

source of energy and inspira-
tion. She got me-interested in
writing, which was something I

had ..alwayJs.wanted to do buthad

never gotten around to doing.
She did that with everyone, en-
couragingthem to be their best.”

In addition to her husband,
Mullins is survived by sons Wil-
liam C.Mullins of Potomac,Md.,
Oliver C. Mullins ofRidgefield,

Conn., Timothy B. Mullins of V P

Squirrel Hill and Garrick R.
Mullins of Bethesda, Md.; a
brother, Gordon Bonner of
HiltoniHead, S.C., and nine

JOHNSON: It’s hard for me to tell at this point. I must
say that I was impressed with the student leaders I met

advocates and representatives of the student body. They
were very articulate in expressing ideas and issues. How-

‘ ever, it was hard for me, having only been there [at Pitt]

for a short period of time, to have a handleon the exact
situation regarding food service or housing or whatever.

provosts and the academic deans, just to get a feel for
what their thoughts and expectations are for the Univer-
sity and for the Division of Student-Affairs. It’s such a
large university, it will take a little time to do that. Until
I have a feel for what people believe is needed at the
University, I wouldn’t want to jump in and make imme-
diate changes. ’

Based on what you have heard so far-from people at

Pitt, what do they consider to be the major Student_

Affairs issues here?
My general impression is that they are looking for
some leadership in the division. I think sometimes Stu-

dent Affairs people know what they do, but they don’t

tell the storyvery well to the rest of the campus. So, part
of it will be better communication with the restof the
University about theexcellent programs, opportunities

and services that are currently provided by Student I
Affairs, and then getting feedback on what we could do-

better.
VVhat was your impression of the climate at Pitt for
minority students? Is it a welcoming environment,
in your opinion? Do you have any plans for minority
student initiatives? ’

Gosh, it’s really hard to say at this point. ‘A couple of

‘people mentioned to me that they would like to see a

cultural center or minorities center on the 'campus.
Again, as I said, I would need to take some time to study
the situation. At Slippery Rock, we have a ‘minority
student affairs office that works very well for us, and the
students seem to be pleased with the programs and
services that that office provides. But what works for us
may or may not work for universities such as the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh.

Could you say more about your minority student
affairs office? ' ‘

Basically, when I came to Slippery Rock, there was no
such ofﬁce. The attitude was that minority students
should just use the regular services that everyone else
uses. But unfortunately,‘ our minority students weren’t
doing that. They were going to our minority faculty,
which was a natural thing for them to do. However, our
faculty are busy,~as I’m sure faculty are at the University
of Pittsburgh. Although they care a great dealabout out

at». ‘

students, they have a limited amount of time, knowing

that they need to work on tenure and promotion and

research. I thought we needed an office and staff who
could devote more- time to those special student con-
cerns. ’ -

It’s often the case that someone with a job like yours
ends up being, in effect, just the dean of on—campus
undergraduates. What will you do for students who
live off campus, including graduate students?

Well, we certainly can’t ignore graduate and com-
muting students. They have special needs for services
and programs as well. It would be my expectation that we
should, in the Division of Student'Affairs, spend some
time with these students and find out what we can do to
help them to be academically successful. ,

I  - VV’hether it’s"special' h“ours‘for*tutoring‘ or‘?-a "Family?

recreation program or eveningihours for offices where
they can get special assistance, I think we need to address
those needs of the commuting ‘and graduatestudents.
Their focus is a little bit different, their time on campus

is different, they’re looking for different kinds of ser— 0

vices, sometimes, than traditional undergraduate stu-
dents. My plan would be, probably, to get some focus
groups going and work with existing groups represent-
ing graduate students and commuter students to find out
what more we can do for them.

Pitt, like alot of other schools, is admitting growing

, numbers of disabled students, including some with

so-called “invisible” learning disabilities like Atten-
tion Deﬁcit Disorder. Do you have any plans in this
area? ' .

The provost has said that he wants me to look at the

needs ofstudents at the University ofPittsburgh and talk

with him about where we need to go. Having assessed
the needs ofstudents with disabilities, ifthere appears to
be a greater need there, he seemed to be open to
addressing this.

Another trend is mixing .academic and non-aca-

demic activities — presenting lectures in dorms, for

example. Do you see that trend increasing? '
Oh, definitely. Students benefit tremendously from

the out-of-classroom experience. VVhen we can involve _

faculty in that experience as well, it’s another plus. One
program we have at Slippery Rock is an adopt—a—profes-
sor program, where a residence hall floor-- “adopts” a
faculty member-. The students might invite that faculty
member to dinner in the cafeteria, or they might invite
them to give a special lecture.

We have specialty floors in our residence halls, as the
University of Pittsburgh does. Our honors program is
actually located in one of our residence halls. We have
an education floor, a fine arts ﬂoor, a wellness floor, a
quiet hours floor. For some special occasions or lectures,
we try. to involve commuter students. Those students
may not ‘want to live‘ in the residence halls, but they
might want to come for a special occasion.

The University of Pittsburgh has some 5,000 stu-
dents in residence. VVhere else would it be easier to reach

-those students who might be academically in trouble
‘than to bring tutors or writing labs to the residence

halls?

UNIVERSITY TIMESS

University Senate race
features 2 experienced
presidential candidates

It’s a safe bet that the next University Senate president will be (for
the fourth consecutive year) a Graduate School of Public Health
professor. But will it be incumbent Nathan Hershey, who has presided
over the Senate for the last two years? Or his predecessor, Gordon
MacLeod? ' '

In the following columns, the candidates outline their views on the
state of the University and issues facing the Senate. University Senate
election ballots, which will include candidates for Faculty Assembly as
well as the three Senate officer positions, will be mailed to faculty early
next month. The deadline for returning completed ballots to the

Senate ofﬁce, 1234 Cathedral of Learning, will be April 21.

NdthaniHershey

VVhen I began my service as Senate vice president
nearly five years ago, I was well aware of the apparent
hostility between the faculty, and the administration and
the Board ofTrustees. I felt that finding ways to improve
the relationship would be a very desirable and useful
undertaking.

After I was elected president of the Senate, I estab—‘
lished a working group to examine the subject of board-
faculty relationships. The group has met informally ap-
proximately every three months, and with the chancellor
on more than one occasion. One product ofthis group’s
efforts is the Take a Board Member to Class program. Its
objective is to help bridge the gap between board and
faculty. We gained the support ofboth the chancellor and '
the board chairperson because, presumably, they believed, as we did, that contacts
between board members and faculty would benefit the individuals who participated
personally, as well as the University. In addition, I havesent personal notes of
appreciation on behalf of the. faculty to board members who have participated in
University functions, such as honors convocation, commencement and the freshman
convocation. ~

To sum up, I want to change the climate at the University so that we can accept
that there can be conflicting positions, as we have, for example, on the subject of
health benefits for same-sex partners, without hostility.

In my opinion, the chancellor and I have been in a confidence—building mode
during my tenure as president. The chancellor personally, and the administration
usually, have been responsive to requests that I have made, and we have kept each
other informed on matters befofe they became public. The cha_ncellor, on more than
one occasion, has telephoned me about an announcement or decision beforeit
became public, so that I would not be surprised by what was to appear in the media.
VVhen I knew that the piece I wrote for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last fall in favor
of the University providing same-sex partners health benefits was to be published
soon, I promptly notified the chancellor and sent him a copy of the text.

Ifl serve again as president, I hope to build on the trust developed over the last A

two years, and work to improvethe degree ofcooperation and collaboration between
the ‘faculty and the administration, both in the formal Senate processes and in other
contexts.

The largest substantiveissue on the horizon, one that I have not yet touched on,
has been triggered by the proposal to lengthen the period during which a clinician
faculty, member ofthe School ofMedicine can obtain tenure. That specific proposal
prompted interest in a wide array of tenure issues. One is the tenure—granting process
at the University, particularly in Health Sciences, where many, ifnot most, faculty
are not hired in the tenured stream and cannot attain tenure. Another is replacement
of tenured faculty, on their retirement, with non—tenure-stream faculty.

Some remarks at the Senate Council meeting ofMarch 13 by administrators help
explain the renewed attention to tenure issues. For example, Provostjames Maher
said, “A lot of the people currently not in the tenure stream, in non—tenure-stream
appointments, particularly in the School of Medicine,‘but really throughout the
Health Sciences, are people who wouldn’t have had faculty titles at all 30 years ago.”
Senior Vice Chancellor/Dean Arthur Levine, referring to “the large number of
clinicians who really are pure clinicians, but who also merit being members offaculty
because they teach,” said, “They don’t need academic freedom or want academic
freedom.” « ‘

Another subject I- expect to see capturing attention this coming year is the
University’s relationship with the business world. At the nation’s research universi-
ties, particularly with regard to scientific and medical research, questions are being
raised about the possible compromise of academic values in the relationship between
a university and the medical—industrial complex. An article on this subject appears in
the March issue ofThe Atlantic Monthly. The University of Pittsburgh, like many
other academic institutions, has a burgeoning Office ofTechnology Management.
An appropriate concern of faculty is that, in the quest to provide products for
commercial exploitation, for the financial benefit ofinvolved faculty, the University,
and a drug or equipment manufacturer, the University and faculty members will be
placed in a position of having to accede to demands of the business concerns with
which they deal and, by doing so, deviate from the ethics ofthe academy.

In industry, in response to perceived legal risks, compliance programs are all the
rage. Perhaps, because of ethical risks, in addition to those concerning human
subjects and research animals, and privacy of personal information, a University
compliance program with substantial faculty participation, directed to protection of
traditional academic norms is necessary. For example, has the University entered
into contracts with drug companies or other participants in the health care industry
that impose inappropriate controls over publication or other activity by faculty, to
safeguard the proprietary interests ofcommercial sponsors of research or prospec-
tive joint ventures? I don’t have the answer, but the question cannot be ignored,
because such problems have been present elsewhere. I I

- March 15,1998

Now, two years later, it is —a high honor to have been
nominated again to serve another term as president of the‘
University Senate. If elected, I shall continue my efforts
to enhance the faculty’s role in shared governance of our
University with the administration and the Board of ‘
Trustees. ‘

Upon returning from the semester—long academic experience late last December
after circumnavigating the globe, I have had an opportunity to take a fresh look at
some of the challenges‘ facing the University of Pittsburgh. The administration
appears to be quite successful in its efforts in fundraising, building construction and
athletic program development. Despite such progress, however, I was disappointed
to find that so many on the faculty still seem to be demoralized. It is even more
lamentable that so many on the faculty concede that nothing can be done about it.

A few years ago, the Pitt Board of Trustees removed voting rights from faculty,
staff and student representatives on board committees, thus almost completely

excluding effective faculty participation in University governance. The loss of voting ~

rights was indeed regrettable, especially since a‘ lot of facultymembers are much
more knowledgeable about University life than many on the board.

For years the faculty,. as a community of scholars, has consistently

called for shared governance because of their compelling interest in the

academic mission and other aspects of‘University li_fe. Whether anything
can be done about the lack of a faculty, voice in governance is a matter of
opinion. But we as faculty members should stand ﬁrm in our goal to regain an
appropriate role in governance that would benefit all aspects of University life.

Permit me to cite two issues among many related to governance that appear to be
troubling the faculty at present. As further evidence of a progressive loss of faculty
input in governance, witness the report in the University Times just two months ago
in whichthe chair of the Senate budget policies committee bitterly complained that
the administration and trustees had bypassed the University Planning and Budgeting
System. Formerly, through this process, administrators worked with faculty mem-
bers appointed by the Senate in drafting Pitt’s annual operating and capital budgets,
as well as its long-range plans. The article went on to say that'Arthur G. Ramicone,
vice chancellor for Budget and Controller, said he was pledged not to discuss the new goals
(italics mine). Ramicone said trustees consulted with him and other administrators,
and had “considerable interactions” with deans in setting the goals. But as another
faculty member who had long participated in the planning and budgeting process
noted this time, “there was no direct participation by the faculty.”

Second, the brouhaha about Pitt’s policy against same-sex health benefits
continues to bring national and even international embarrassment to the
faculty and the University as a whole. The Senate’s anti-discriminatory policies
committee and the Faculty Assembly have strongly endorsed such benefits.
"It would appear that a clear majority of the faculty opposes the University’s posturing
on same-sex health benefits. . 

Recently, the University Library System’s faculty organization joined a number
of other campus. groups in urging Pitt to extend health benefits to same-sex
partners of faculty and staff. Librarians at the meeting went on to observe, “This
policy negatively affects the University’s ability to recruit and retain highly qualified
and talented academic scholars.” Faculty concerns over issues such as these are either

‘ ignored or disregarded by the administration.

As a result of these and other edicts, there is considerable evidence of a growing
chasm between the faculty and University policymakers. The adverse
effects of the administration’s continued stonewalling the faculty on matters of
University governance has created enough dissatisfaction to cause some faculty
members to reconsider the matter of collective bargaining or even, asrumored, to
result in the departure of distinguished scholars.

One suggestion for validating the degree of faculty discontent would be for
the Faculty Assembly to conduct opinion polls on major issues affecting
University life, using statistical sampling so as to hold down cost. It would be a first
step in corroborating impressions while at the same time possibly initiating a
dialogue between faculty and administration. Such referenda could lead to the
resumption of needed academic input in the governance of a great University.

Those ofus on the faculty who have made the commitment to pursue an academic
career must never forsake our long-standing dedication to collegial advancement as
a community of scholars by sharing in the governance of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Then, we can truly acclaim our University’s anthem: Hail to Pitt! I

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Chancellor reports on
state of the University a

COTNINUED FROM PA GE 1
ta ge . ”

The marketplace reaction to -

Pitt’s push to improve under-
graduate education over the past
few years has been very encour-
aging, Nordenberg said, as evi-
denced by a 60 percent hike in
freshman applications at the
Pittsburgh campus; rising SAT
scores and high school class
rankings, and a high number of
Rhodes and Marshall scholar-
ship winners.

The University also has “ef-
fectively leveraged its research
engine,” Nordenberg said, by
retiring start-up debts, upgrad-
ing laboratories, revitalizing a
dormant research incentive fund
and nurturing interdisciplinary
research programs between de-
partments and with other uni-
versities. “It is our research cul-
ture that distinguishes us from
most colleges and universities
and support of that culture al-
lows faculty researchers to reach
the highest level of attainment

and to perform research that_

touches lives,” he said.
Focusing on academic plan-

ning priorities, the chancellor

said, “The success of academic

"units themselves depends in large

part on their ability to articulate
their needs. There has been a
range in the ways various units
respond [to théplaning process].
In the main, the provost and I
have been pleased with the plans,
to date.”

Nordenberg said that plans
with the most promise have five
common features: an over~arch—
ing commitment to the highest
quality; willingness and ability
to make responsible fiduciary
choices; 'a high value assigned to
human worth; connections to the
community, and overall respect
for Pitt’s mission.

“Our level ofstate support is
not as high as that _of our AAU
peers. There is no quick fix to
that and almost always there will
be internal resource allocations,
triggered by units’ plans,” as part
ofthe formula, he said.

‘Nordenberg added that as
recently as fall 1995 his adminis-
tration was faced with a budget

built around a University—wide
salary freeze. Pitt is much more
fiscallyisound now, he said, in
part due to recent internal initia-
tives, such as the faculty early
retirement program, a restruc-
tured relationship with UPMC
Health System, a comprehen-

’ sive master facilities plan, a nearly
com lete information technol— *
P .

ogy plan, the ongoing upgrad-
ing ofPitt’s information systems
and a more business—like ap-
proach with outside vendors —
all of which have helped ensure
cost—effectiveness and efficiency.

4 He touted Pitt’s recent
strengthening ofits role in com-
munityidevelopment and estab-
lishing respectful relations with
local neighbors and city officials.
“There is better appreciation by
the communities of what we
bring to them from each of our
five [regional] schools. As Pitt
Chancellor George Woods said
125 years ago, ‘education is the
best means to new industries 

and academic science lies _at the -

heart of commercial innovation.’
There ‘is a growing recognition
that the region’s promising com-

mercial possibilities are tied to

this University’s strengths,”
Nordenberg said.

Despite the stereotype of aca-
demic life as cushy, the chancel-

lorsaid, “I do not believe that‘

anyone in this room has an easy
job.... I regularly wake up before
the alarm goes off, and even be-
fore your eyes are open your
mind is racing with ways you’ll
deal with the challenges of that
day. I’ve had my fair share of
difficult problems and difficult

people, but when I leave the of— I

fice at the end of the day, I re-
mind myself how lucky I am to
be where I am and doing what
I’m doing.”

Nordenberg said he felt sure
that Pitt’s greatest days are
ahead. “By creatively applying
our shared vision and having faith
in our ability to pursue lofty
goals, I have no doubt that our
greatest victories are yet to come.
I look forward to sharing‘ them
with you.”

National surveys show that
binge drinking is still on the
rise among undergraduates.
How do you combat it?

It’s a difficult situation, be-
cause 90 percent of the students
who come to us have consumed
alcohol before they get to col-
lege. It’s not as ifbinge drinking
just starts on college and univer-
sity campuses.

.' I think we‘ need to continue
education programs on our cam-
puses. And it can’t be just every

other year. It has to -be every

year, several times a year, be-
cause we have new freshmen and
transfer students every year. Of-
ten, it’s new students who are
just beginning to experience life
away from home who get into

’ alcohol and other drugs.
I would expect to continue '
_ with alcohol education programs

throughout the [Pitt] campus
and, hopefully, to include fac-
ulty in that process. Faculty are
the ones who have to deal with
students who come to class hung
over. Faculty are the ones who

can teljlif their students are still

drunk from the night before. If

we-can work with facultyin help-"

ing to deal with those situations,
maybewe can  A ' ,  _, V v_

Providing alternative‘ activi-
ties [to drinking] is also impor-
tant. Here at Slippery Rock,
we ’ve established a programming
board. One ofits major respon-
sibilities is to work on weekend

activities that don’t involve alco- ,

hol. There are many students
who don’t drink at all. Some-
times, it’s these students who
end up in the residence halls by

themselves on the weekend be-

cause everybody else has gone
out to a party.

Some Pitt students have sug-
gested creating a non-alco-
holic, under-21 nightclub on
campus. Would you consider
that? .
Absolutely. Here at Slippery
Rock, we use a grill area in our
university union for a non-alco_—
holic area on weekends. It’s been
very popular. We have also_bused
our students to local nightclubs
for evenings when those clubs
agreed they would have a band
but not serve alcohol. That has
been very popular as well. We
may be able to form cooperative
agreements with some of the es-
tablishments in Pittsburgh to
provide entertainment withou
serving alcohol. '

In making decisions and. ac-
complishing goals, how do you
plan_to seek and incorporate
student input? ,

I understand that Dr.'[_]ack]
Daniel [vice provost for Aca-
demic Affairs] has been holding
student forums, and I’m told that
they have been very successful in
terms of [eliciting] student in-_
put. I would also hope to meet
regularly with student leaders.
That’s what I do now. At Slip-

 -

pery Rock, I go to all of the
student government meetings.
It would be my expectation
to have an open door policy. If,
say, the Black Action Society
leadership wanted to come and
talk with me, I would be happy to
talk with them. I would also like
to set up regular times when" we
can communicate, not just hap-

hazardly.

In his letter announcing your ,

appointment, Provost Maher
said he will work closely with
you “to revitalize our current
Office of Student "Affairs to
optimize its management, for-
mulate its goals in better align-
ment with those of the Uni-
versity, foster a service cul-
ture in all of its activities, and
adopt the "improvement-
through-reallocation ap-
proach which has served us so
well in addressing problems
in other areas of the Univer-
sity.” That paragraph raises
several questions, one being:

In what ways does the Student:

Affairs ofﬁce need to be revi-

talized? .
Again, that’s something I will

need to explore. When I inter-

   
dent Affairs staff were very en-'

thusiastic about their work and
were very supportive of the aca-
demic mission of the University.
At this moment, I can’t tell you
exactly where these areas are that
need to be revitalized. I want to

learn more about each of the _

programs and spend more time
with the provost to ‘see what his
thoughts are about the direction
in which he would like to’ see

these services go.

People who met you during
your visits to Pitt all described
you as being a very nice per-

" son, and they were impressed

by what you’ve accomplished.
But some have also wondered
aloud: Does this woman know

what she’s getting into? She’s_

leaving a pleasant, rural cam-
pus to come to a big, urban,
research university where
crime, administrative power
struggles and political
squabbles with the local com-
munity are not, let’s say, en-
tirely unknown.

I can understand their con-

’ cern, knowing the rural area of

Slippery Rock (laughing). How-
ever, I have lived in the big city
and have worked at an urban
institution, and‘I’m aware of the
crime that borders the campus.
Slippery Rock is one campus

' among 14in the State System of

Higher Education, but I must
tell you that in terms of_ politics
and paperwork and administra-
tive work, I don’t think it’s any
less difficult to make things hap-
pen here. One example that I
cited‘ during my interviews in-
volved a plan to build an apart-

ment complex on our campus. .
We did surveys, we did research _

studies, we did market analysis
and we had a great financial plan.
I went to someone in the State
System office and was told that
our campus was not in the hous-
ing business, it was in the educa-
tion business. And we werenot
going to build an apartment com-
plex. It’s important for me to be
able to articulate to other uni-
versity‘ administrators what the
students’ needs are, as itis for me
to communicate those needs to
people outside the university. I
was able to do that with the State
System of Higher Education, so
that we now have apartments on
our campus. It was no easy task.

One of the other points I
made during my interviews in
Pittsburgh is that I have_a pas-
sion. Some people have a pas-
sion for sport. I have a passion to
do what’s right for students.

With your hiring, the job title
for your position has been
changed from “vice chancel-
lorforstudent affairs” to “vice
provost and dean of students. ”
What difference, if any, will

that change make for you?"

My title‘ right now is vice
president for student affairs and
dean of students._  think the
“dean ofstudents” part is impor-
tant because it helps students
understand who they can best
relate to. Sometimes, they don’t
know where to go for help, but
when they see that “dean ofstu-
dents” part they say, T‘Ah, that
person is there to help me.”

I think being a vice provost
and having the opportunity to
work closely with the other vice
provosts and the provost is only

going to help to bring academic ’

affairs and Student Affairs closer
together. In working together,
we can move in the direction to
continue to contribute to the
excellence and the opportunities
that are already provided. '

Last year, you received the
Town-Gown Award for excel-
lence in university and com-
munity relations, given by the
Slippery Rock Town-Gown
Association. VVhat did you do
to promote better community

relations at Slippery Rock?
I’m the university’s liaison
with the Borough Council, who
are the elected officials for the
borough [of Slippery Rock]. I
attend their monthly meetings.
This gives me an opportunity to
talk about what’s happening at
the university. It’s also a great_
opportunity for me to get to
know those officials even better,
so that ifthere is a concern in the

community I feel very comfort— ,

able calling one of the council
members or the mayor, and they
feel comfortable calling me.

In addition, I work on the
borough’s economic develop-
ment and revitalization commit-
tee. We’re putting together a
strategic plan and applying for
federal grants as well as founda-
tion monies to bring more eco-
nomic development to the area.

It’s a matter ofbeing involved
in the community, being in-
volved with community leaders.

munity and knowing the people

ministrative responsibilities.” He
gave Nordenberg a C in this
category without elaborating.

Holland gave Litchﬁelda B+,
the only time he graded
Litchﬁeld higher than Norden-
berg, in the category of “leader—
ship in social‘ diversity.” “Much
to Litchfield’s credit,” Holland
said, “he manifested a strong
commitment to academic values
even in the face of opposition by
the conservative industrial elite.”
Holland -cited as examples
Litchfield publicly defending
academic freedom in response
to McCarthy—era investigations,
and assisting students in partici-
pating in a civil rights march in
Alabama. — - i .

' “We might hope today‘ for
bravery in defense of diversity,”
Holland said, giving Nordenberg
a  grade. '

Holland told reporters that
the C he gave the chancellor for
leadership in social diversity
hinged on the issue of same-sex
partner health insurance ben-
efits, which Pitt does not offer.
“It would be a higher grade if
that was not considered; it would
be lower if only that was consid-
ered,” he said.

Finally, Holland‘ gave

Litchﬁeld another F in “goals,”
saying they were unrealistic and
unattainable given Pitt’s start-'
ing point in 1955.

 

.overall economic health and

strength of its reputation. “To—
day, the Ivy League would be a
better target than the best of
public u_niversities.”

He said he had ‘planned to

give No_rdenberg a “no entry” ’

grade in goals, but amended it to
A after hearing the chancellor’s
speech.

Jeanette M. Trauth
Trauth said that goals by

themselves were . inadequate
without clear-cut standards for
measuring them. “First, what
does ‘being among the best’

i mean? Do we want to be among

the bestat educating the largest
and most diverse number of stu-
dents? Or, do we want to be
among the best at teaching the
best students that apply to the
University?” she asked.

And how is that measured,
she continued, “by the total num-
ber ofstudents whom we gradu-
ate? By student academic per-
formance —— GPA? By measur-
ing levels of student satisfaction
as reflected in course evaluations?
By the percent of alumni who
contribute financially” to the
University? Or will we measure
the success of our teaching mis-
sion by the contributions that
our graduates have made to soci-
ety — such as authors, Rhodes
Scholars, inventors, leaders in
business, etc.?”

VVhatever the goal and how-
ever it’s measured, Trauth said,
it ought to be a product of dia-
logue among faculty and not
handed down by the administra-
tion. A

Trauth said getting students
to apply to the University was

not a problem but getting stu-
dents to enroll was directly re-
lated to offering competitive fi-
nancial aid packages.

“If we want them to attend
we need to think seriously about

financial aid,” she said. “It stands’

to reason that investing in stu-
dent aid is a concrete step to-
ward the goal of being ‘student-
centered.’ It also stands to rea-
son that satisfied students — that
is, those who feel that’ faculty,
staff and the administration cared
about them when they attended
the University.— are more likely

I to be alumni who contribute ﬁ-

nancially to the University. This
is a long-term investment.”

Trauth maintained that as‘

more part-time and adjunct fac-

ulty teach at Pitt, the quality of

the courses and the programs ~

suffers, “In thinking about the

number and range of courses -
offered in departments, faculty '

administrators need to think
about who will be offering these
courses,” she said. “As more and
more part-time adjunct faculty
teach at the University we must
take care to monitor the overall
quality and coherence of the
courses and programs we offer.”

Regarding the University’s
research mission, Trauth said
facylty often have to weigh the
competing demands of teaching,
advising and service against a
continuous cycle of grant pro-

y__posal deadlines and time spent
- "co‘i1d11‘ctihg‘rese‘ar‘¢h" and pub-

lishing findings.

“We may be among the best

with regard to our funded re-
search mission,-but the price is,
at times, a reduction in the qual-
ity of our teaching and advising
roles,” she said. “If we are too
busy or stressed that we put off
students and make their concerns
a lower priority, what are we
communicating to them?”
Trauth again asked for clearer
definition of how to measure
success of University goals. “Will
we measure our success in re-
search by the total number of
NIH (National Institutes of
Health) or NSF (National Sci-
ence Foundation) dollars that we
generate? Bythe number of pub-

lications we produce? By the V

impact that the research has upon
society? Or byisome other'com-
bination of standards?”

Trauth cited a local study as
an exampleithat the greatest re-
search dollars don’t always trans-
late into the most influence on
society.

“Recently, researchers at the
Graduate School of Public
Health conducted a study ofthe
impact that not having health
insurance had on children. As a
result of this work, the National
Children’s Health Insurance
Program was passed. This was
not a large, publicly funded study,
but rather [it was funded] by a
‘small local foundation. This ex-
ample illustrates that it is impor-
tant to be careful in thinking
about how we deﬁne and mea-
sure what it means to be among
the best in all that we do —- both
in our research and our teach-
ing.” -

Electrified
acupuncture
for low back
pain in elderly
studied

Pitt physicians are studying
the use of electronically stimu—
lated acupuncture in treating low
back pain caused by osteoarthri-
tis in people over age 65.

The treatment is called per-
cutaneous electrical nerve stimu-

lation (PENS). During the pro— '

cedure, acupuncture needles are
inserted into speciﬁc points in
the lower back, then the needles
are given a mild electrical stimu—
lation. _ -
The study will evaluate the
effect of PENS in reducing pain
intensity and examine its effects
on physical and neuropsych_o—
logical performance, mood and
quality of life.

“This represents the first
well—controlled, comprehensive
examination of alternative medi-
cine intervention for low back
pain in older adults,” said Debra

. K. Weiner, assistant professor

of medicine and principal inves-
tigator in the study. '

An estimated 20 percent of.

older adults suffer from chronic
lower back pain, she said. .

.The study is funded by Pitt’s
Multipurpose Arthritis and Mus-
culoskeletal Diseases Center
grant.

Study shows
EECP improves
left ventricular

. function

». . .-Enhanced Ex.ternal'_Co.un.te.r—
pulsation (EECP) improves left
ventricular function in heart fail-
ure patients, according to a study
presented March 15 by Pitt re-
searchers at the 49th Scientific
Sessions of the American Col-

- lege of Cardiology in Anaheim,

Ca. .

The study, “Improvement in
Left Ventricular Performance by
Enhanced External Counterpul—
sation in Patients with Heart
Failure,” was presented byjohn

School ofMedicine and director
of the Echoeardiography Labo-
ratories at UPMC Presbyterian
Hospital.

When undergoing EECP
treatment, patients lie on a pad-
ded table equipped with infla-
tion and deflation valves con-
nected to specially designed cuffs
applied to the lower extremities
and buttocks.

As the heart begins its resting
phase, the cuffs are inflated se-
quentially from the calves to-

' ward thebuttocks. Just before

the heart pumps, the cuffs are
simultaneously deflated.

This sequence causes the
heart to receive an increased sup-
ply of blood. It also reduces the
heart’s workload and increases
the amount ofblood pumped.

Following 35 one—hour ses-
sions of EECP treatment over
seven weeks, all eight patients in
the study showed significant in-
creases in their left ventricular
function and their ejection frac-
tion. Patients also experienced a

‘decrease in their heart rate.

“EECP appears to be benefi-

cial to left ventricular function

i in heart failure patients and may

be a useful adjunct to medical
therapy,” Gorcsan said.

According to the American
Heart Association, 4.9 million
patients in the United States have
heart failure. With 400,000 new
cases each year,.heart failure is
the single most frequent cause of
hospitalization for people age 65
and older.

The VVPIC center, originally
funded in 1995 , is renowned for
its research of medications and
therapies that relieve symptoms
of elderly depression and im-
prove recovery response time and
for its work to help find ways to
prevent suicide among depressed
elderly.

“VVhen we started this center
five years ago, we set out to learn
how best to help the depressed

“elderly,” said Charles F.

Reynolds III, professor of psy-
chiatry and neuroscience. “It’s
gratifying to know that NIMH
recognizes that our work is help-
ing people live better lives.”

Research studies at the cen--
ter assess methods to lower the
suicide rate among the depressed
elderly,’examine the impact of
stress on family caregivers of
patients with dementia, use brain
imaging to study physical
changes brought on by aging,
and evaluate new drugs for safety
and effectiveness.

The center also provides ser-
vices such_as evaluations and con-
sultations and provides treatment
courses that stress both medica-
tion and talk therapy.

This spring, the center will
begin publishing a newsletter
called “Aging Upbeat” to inform
patients, doctors andlegislators
about new developments in treat-
ing depression. '

Medical
entrepreneur
center set up

The University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute (UPCI) has
launched the Scott Limbach
Center for Medical Entrepre-
neurship. The center will pro-
mote medical entrepreneurial
knowledge and activities among
UPCI faculty and students
through education and resource
support.

Initial funding for the center
has been provided by a grant
from Scott Limbach.

Educational activities of the
Limbach Center will include a
lecture series featuring success-
ful medical entrepreneurs, semi-
nars onpbusiness issues related to
entrepreneurship, and possibly
a medical entrepreneurship de-
gree program.

Support functions of the cen-
ter will include providing “pre—
seed” funding for projects with
commercial potential, and ad-
vice on business management
issues.

Ronald B. Herberman, UPCI
director, said: “The Limbach
Center will be a valuable asset in
assisting our faculty and re-
searchers in becoming more in-
volved in taking important ideas

from the laboratory to the mar- ,

ketplace. After the-center begins
to achieve this goal related to
cancer research, we envision that
it .¥’:i11-.l1..€.-.:l2._r_931.Sl._e¥1ed to encom-
pass a much wider range of op-
portunities across the Schools of
the Health Sciences at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.”

He noted that UPCI faculty
have obtained more than $90
million annually in federal and
other funding. “The Limbach
Center offers a very novel way to
build on that strong foundation
and spawn substantial growth in
related economic development
that will be beneficial not only to
the University, but also to the
western Pennsylvania region,”
Herberman said. . 0 I

Optimism: Good for you

Studies show th-at optimists are healthier and less likely
to develop depression than pessimists are. Optimists also
seek medical and mental health treatment less frequently.

University, RAND establish

health care research institute

The University and the
RAND Corp. have formed a

partnership to establish a joint
' health care research institute in

Pittsburgh. _The RAND/ Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Health Re-

search Institute will focus‘ on

’implementing and evaluating

health care interventions in real
world environments, linking
clinical innovations with health
care policy to create and sustain
improvements in health care de-
livery in communities across the
country. A

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nor-P _

denberg said that the new insti-
tute will provide benefits to the
community while enhancing the
region’s strong reputation in the
health sciences. ‘
“The institute will bring to-
gether experts at the national
forefront -of health care from
RAND and the University of
Pittsburgh to address the
country’s most pressing health
care issues as they are manifested
in western Pennsylvania. In this
way, the institute’s research
agenda will embody national

' concerns while simultaneously
reflecting the needs and re-,

sources of the Pittsburgh com-
munity,” he said. A

Nordenberg added that west-
ern Pennsylvania residents will
benefit directly from the
institute’s work.

“Pittsburgh and the sur-
rounding communities will serve
as areal world laboratory for
examining and reﬁning the de-
livery of health services in the
context of complex social, eco-
nomic and organizational sys-
tems. All groundbreaking inno-
vations will be implemented first
in Pittsburgh and the surround-
ing communities, thus ensuring
that our region remains in the
forefront of progress in clinical
research, health «policy and the
delivery of health care services-,”
he said.

Potential areas of research at

‘ the institute could include broad

national issues, such as equity
and disparities in health care uti-

lization and outcomes; health
care, issues relevant to specific
groups, such as women’s health,
low-birth—weight infants, sub-
stance abuse treatment and geri-
atric/ aging issues; and issues re-
lated to the design and use of
health care information systems,
including opportunities for soft-
ware development to support
medical record assessment.

Arthur S. Levine, Pitt senior
vice chancellor for the Health
Sciences and dean ofthe School
of Medicine, pointed out that
RAND and the University of
Pittsburgh are “uniquely quali-
fled” to undertake the institute’s
research program. because they
have complementary strengths.

“RAND has worked exten-
sively on the scientific basis for
improving health care service de-
livery, system performance, or-
ganizational effectiveness and
implementing clinical improve-
ments in operating health care
delivery systems. Pitt brings key
strengths in the areas of heath
services research, clinical re-
search, basic science research,
mental health services, systems
analysis and information tech-
nology, along with an institu-
tional culture that promotes re-
search efforts that cross the
boundaries of traditional disci-
plines,” Levine said. _

Harold A. Pincus, professor
and vice chair of the Depart-
ment of Psychiatry at Pitt, will
be the director of the institute.
Prior‘ to joihin'g'Pitti"n February,
Pincus served for 14 years as
deputy medical director and di-
rector ofthe Office of Research
for the American Psychiatric
Association.

' Both RAND and Pitt‘ have
invested seed money toestablish
the new institute. The majority
of the ongoing funding for the
institute’s research efforts is ex-
pected to come‘ from national
foundations and the federal gov-
ernment, but local support also
will be sought to help dissemi-
nate innovations to the region as

a whole. I
