VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 100

Bush tours UPMC,
announcesplans to 
increase funding for
bioterror prevention

DAVE HARTMAN7
News Editor

It puts some strain on a University’s resources '

when the president shows up.

At least that’s what George _, W. Bush told Pitt

Chancellor Mark -Nordenberg during a presidential
address in the Masonic Temple yesterday. Bush brieﬂy
thanked the chancellor for making those resources

« available for his early‘ afternoon visit, but the comman-

der-in—chief’s remarks focused on another kind of
resource: knowledge. ._ '

Before his speech, Bush toured parts of UPMC
Presbyterian, where he learned about the hospital’s
recent advances and projects — specifically those that
would prove beneficial in the event of a bioterrorist
attack. Then, during his remarks, Bush announced the
formation of a Biomedical Security Institute, which
will be a joint anti-bioterrorism project by Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University. ‘

Assistant News Editor

During his speech in the Masonic
Temple yesterday afternoon, President
George W. Bush outlined his support
for the war against bioterrorism, citing
specifically the $6 billion he’s added
to the budget to combat biological ter-
ror. .
V Flanked by Director of Homeland
Security Tom Ridge and head of the
Department of Health and Human
Services Tommy Thompson, Bush
thanked Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University for creating new programs
designed to prevent large-scale casual-
ties in the event of a biological attack.

Bush spoke about the Real-time
Outbreak and Disease Surveillance
System laboratory, operating here in
Western Pennsylvania and in Utah,
which monitors biological threats.

“What we saw [in Pittsburgh] was.

how to take. . .data on a real-time basis
to determine if there was an outbreak
of any kind, including a terrorist
attack,” Bush said. “The best way to
protect the homeland is to understand
what’s taking place on the homeland
so we can respond.” _

According to a press release, the
program immediately transmits data
onpatients’ complaints and symptoms,
without the patient’s name or identify-
ing information, from the hospital to
the RODS system, where -it is ana-
lyzed. Analysts monitoring the system

lookfor unusual increases in symp-
"' toms such as rash, paralysis, hemor-

rhage, ﬂu-like symptoms, respiratory
illnesses and other indicators of possi-
ble bioterrorism.

Bush also congratulated Pitt and
CMU for creating the Biomedical

Greeks anoint god and goddess at Club Laga

~, CHRISTINE CLAUS
For The Pitt News

At the Greek God and Goddess charity event Monday
night, 11 sororities and 12 fraternities participated in a talent
show and pageant contest at Club Laga to raise money for
the Mario Lemieux Foundation. ‘

“Our goal for the year is to raise $100,000. . .and we’re
more than half way there,” said Becca Normand, a member
of Delta Delta Delta.

Normand and Richard Carlson are the Greek Week
chairs. Together, they keep track of the points that each ﬁa-
temity and sorority receives from each event and tally them
up at the end of the year. Points are awarded for winning
competitions, participating in events, attendance and
ftmdraisers.

The evening began with a forrnalwear beauty pageant.
Each fraternity and sorority that participated had a represen-
tative come out onto the stage in suit and tie or an evening

, gown. »
“I wanted to help out and get involved, plus you get to '

get all dressed up in a pretty dress,” said Emily Keytack, a
Chi Omega sister and one of the emcees for the event. “We
wanted to change it up a little and make it more of a pageant
show.”

Following the introductions, a humorous sleepwear
question—and-answer session took place on the stage.

“We want to make it fun, so while in their sleepwear,
there is a question and answer period. They are judged on
the creativity of their answers,” said Bryan Thomas, emctx:
and member of Pi Kappa Alpha _ .

Susan Angello, a member of Delta Zeta, was asked, “If
you died and came back in another life what would you
come back as?”

She replied with a sly smile, “I’d come back as a leop-
ard because they are sexy, wild and exotic.” _

, Michael Pavetto, a member of Kappa Sigma, was
asked, “If you had three wishes what would they be?”

_“To be rich, famous, and own the Playboy mansion,” he
said. '

The question—and-answer session went over well with
the crowd as they screamed and applauded with each

“It’s good to not only see all the talent, but to see the
cohesion and support of all the houses together,’-’ Pavetto

added.

Acts ranged from singing and dancing to comedy perfor-

Elana Israel, a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, wore a
shimmering white evening gown as she wowed the crowd
with a chilling and heart—felt rendition of “Angel.”

Archie Yellow-Duke, member of Lambda Chi Alpha, 0

performed the ﬁnal scene ﬁom Shakespeare’s classic

‘Romeo and Juliet,’” said Emily Sinnamon, member of

THE PITT NEWS

Bush calls Pittsburgh a

new ‘Knowledge Town’ 2

Bush, page 1

Pittsburgh...that while Pittsburgh
used to be called Steel Town, you
need to call it Knowledge Town.”
Bush’s 22-minute speech
focused on the need for increased
homeland security, specifically
addressing anti-bioterrorism efforts
for which UPMC served as a model.
Alongside former Pennsylvania
Gov. Tom Ridge, now the director
of homeland security, Bush asked

‘Congress to support a budgetary

increase of more than ‘300 percent
to combat bioterrorism. His pro-

posed budget includes nearly $6

billion that will be directed toward

defending the country

bioterror. ,
“It’s money that we gotta

spend,” _Bush said.

By directing more resources
toward producing and perfecting
vaccines and cures for potential
weapons of bioterrorism, Bush said,
America will not only protect itself
from the threat of biological war-
fare, but ‘will also buildpa better,
more efficient and effective health
care system as a result. He" said
many scientists believe that
increased research on bioterrorism
will likely result in advances in the
treatment of diseases such as tuber-
culosis, pneumonia, malaria, HIV
and AIDS.

Switching quickly from a warm,
humorous welcome to a stern and
serious warning about the threat of
terrorism at home, Bush delivered

his. address standing in front of a’

team of 12 UPMC doctors. But
Bush was speaking to doctors
across America: he repeatedly said
that every region around the coun-
try needs the right equipment, med-

icine and funding to effectively

combat bioterrorism.

He called for the continual
stockpiling of antibiotics and vac-
cines, and said the country. will
have enough antibiotics on hand to
treat 20 million anthrax infections
by the end of the year He also
promised funding that would enable
states to distribute those-drugs
swiftly. _ ‘

Bush also addressed the need to
upgrade communication between
federal, state and local law enforce-
ment agencies and medical institu-
tions. ’

He called for improvements to
the ~country’s airports and airport
security, the tracking of disease
outbreaks, and said that America

against _ ,

must be “prepared to fight any kind
of war on bioterror.” V

The president said that his sin-
gle most important job is to protect
the security of the United States,
and praised Ridge as “somebody
who’s tough, somebody who’s
smart and somebody who can artic-
ulate the issues we face.”

Bush thanked other politicians
including. Republican Melissa Hart
and Democrat Mike Doyle for
attending the speech, and for doing
their part to help protect America.

Citing the presence of members
from both political parties at the
speech, Bush stressed the impor-
tance of bipartisan collaboration in
working to defend the country.

“As far as I can tell, in
Washington, D.C.,...you don’t have
to be a Republican to love the coun-
try, or a Democrat to love the coun-
try, we all love our country,” he

said. Though most of ’the speech‘

focused on advances in health care

that will aim to safeguard the coun-

try against bioterrorism, Bush also
rallied support "by updating the
approximately 300 people in atten-

dance on the war overseas.
“The surest way to protect *

America at home is to...find the
killers, wherever they hide, rout
them out, and bring them to jus-
tice,” Bush said to a roomsuddenly
filled with applause.” -

“I truly believe that by...hold—
ing people accountable for murder-
ous deeds, the world will be a more
peaceful place for our children and
our grandchildren,” he said.

Bush said that Osama bin Laden
isn’t the issue, and that the country
instead needs to focus on interna-
tional terror as a whole. .

But he quipped, “I ‘like our

chances against bin Laden.”
' Bush urged Americans to join
the War against terror in their own
way, whether that means mentoring
a child or simply committing‘ an act
of kindness every day. The presi-
dent said he' thinks “the best way to
fight off evil is to do some acts of
goodness.” '

“There’s no doubt in my mind
that out of the incredible evil that

_was done, great goodness will

come, and America will be better
off for it.” . .

. Bush left the Masonic Temple
just before 2:30 p.m.,. traveling. in
the presidential motorcade down a
completely car-less and barricaded
Fifth Avenue as he waved at stu-
dents on their way to class.

Bush proposes $6 billion

in bioterrorismdefense

Bioterror detection, page 11

Security Institute “to help_protect the
nation in all ways from the insidious
biological attack.” He noted that while
funds from the Department of
Defense, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the
Department of Health and Human
Services support
Security Institute, he _g has asked
Congress for additional money to com-
bat bioterrorism.

“For instance, we’re asking for
$1.6 billion,” he said. “This is addi-
tional money for state and local gov-

ernments to improve their ability to‘

cope with any biological attack. . . [in] a
way that will help the American people
survive any attack if it were to come.”

Bush’s plan includes , utilizing a
program created by Dr. Michael
Allswede, who works in UPMC’s
emergency medicine ‘ division.
A1lswede’s Recognition, Personal

the Biomedical ‘

Protection, Decontamination and
Triage/Treatment system is designed
to aid first responders —— typically
emergency medical services members
— to recognize the symptoms of a
bioterrorism attack. Allswede started
the program while working with the
Michigan state police, and said that he
has trained between 250 and 300
Pittsburgh EMS workers in its meth-
ods.

Allswede said hedeveloped the

idea as a military commander in Desert '

Storm, where he experienced the threat
of bioterrorism first-hand.

“I was a target [of Saddam
Hussein’s chemical weapons attacks],”
he said.

Bush also mentioned the $2.4 bil-
lion to develop new test protocols and
treatments for biological weapons.

S “We need better testing, better,

vaccines, and better drugs if‘; America

is going to be as safe as it can possibly ,

be,” he said.‘

carried a custom-made American

ﬂag with fifty corporate logos,
- replacing each star.

George Brittenburg,
ers disliked Bush’s foreign policies
and his stance’ on terrorism.

“We are against imperialism and
the bombing of the poor country,
Afghanistan,?’ he said. “The oli-
cies against countries like Iraq
began with -his father and continue
today and we don’t believe in
them.”

Other members of his group
held signs reading,’ “Want to uproot
evil? Try ripping’ out your Bush,”
and “Homeland Security is
American for Gestapo.”

When city and campus police’

secured the area around Tennyson

Street, causing severe congestion’-
on the sidewalks, tension developed‘ '
between protesters and Bush sup-

porters. Despite the tension, there
were no serious confrontations.

In preparation for Bush’s visit,
employees who work in the
Masonic Temple entered and exited

through a designated door, accord’-
ing to-Britt Keefer, a customer ser-

a Pitt
' senior, said his group of 20 protest-

vice representative in the Media
Instruction Services. The only
interruptions to theirregular work-
day occurred when the ground
offices were cleared out so the
Secret Service could inspect the
area for safety.

Port Authority buses made no
special detours or schedule changes
to accommodate the president’s
visit. Traffic built up once police’
closed Fifth Avenue, but the delays
lasted less than 10 minutes.

Students who jammed the side-
walks and pathways around the
Masonic Temple had different rea-
sons for waiting in the cold to get a
glimpse of the president.

“I have never seen a president

in person before,” sophomore Jess
Schaitkin said. ‘.‘So I’m really excit-
ed to be able to- see him for myself
and not just on television.”

Nate Stephenson said -he was
impressed with the president’s
motorcade and how the city stopped
to allow him to pass through.

, “You see how the president gets
around on television, with all the
black cars and vans and escorts,” he
said. “-Now we all get to see it for

"ourselves, and I’m very impressed.

I’m glad I’m here to see this. It’s
definitely better than going to
class.” _~

Bush’s bioterrorism plan welcome

If you were anywhere around campus
yesterday, you undoubtedly noticed the
extra people bustling about.

Yesterday, President. George W. Bush
spoke in the Masonic Temple.

' Although this was not Bush’s ﬁrst

appearance‘ in Pittsburgh — he made sever- ‘

al during his campaign _— Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg remarked that this was the ﬁrst

time in his memory that a sitting president

has spoken on campus. ,_

T The president toured arm-bioterrorism
facilities yesterday at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center before unveiling
his plan to combat bioterrorism. UPM
plays a large role in this plan. 

Like him or not, we should all be 

that the president chose to speak at our 

pus. Our school and its medical center  .
terday were featured on the news all 

the country. This certainly helps 
our prestige.
Bush’s plan to increase funding to cen-

ters studying bioterrorism and coordinating ’

‘Bush’s

In the gods of finance we unfortunately trust  

I remember a telling moment
from then—President—elect George
W. Bush’s press confer-
ence announcing the
appointment of Paul
O’Neill as secretary of
the treasury. Bush was
plodding along in his
remarks, mostly gazing.
downward, when he sud-
denly looked up and in a
comically contrived way
reminded the assembled

power to pursue fiscal policies
favorable to small farmers and
debtors generally.

Two hundred years
later the austere republic
of merchants and slave-
holders is an empire in

all but name, and the
policies of the U.S.
Treasury — whether
directly or refracted

through institutions like
the World Bank and

press corps that O’Neill
was to become “the successor to
Alexander Hamilton.”

At that moment his aides had
been fastidiously coaching their
commander-in-chief: '

“You’ve got to say something
that sounds presidential, sir.”

“Presidential? Yeah, I can do
that.” 9

' “You have to, sir. Remember, a
lot of people aren’t convinced that
you’re really the president, after
all.”

“Uh-huh, bit of a squeaker, yep.
Florida, Supreme Court, dimpled
chads, .

Jeb’s the governor?”

“Yes, sir. Well, people expect
the president to have a sense of his-
tory. So you have to say something

that sounds profound. Tell them that .

O’Neill is ‘the
Alexander Hamilton.
As tends to happen more than
once in the course of any one of
painstakingly choreo-
graphed public performances, his
delivery was especially forced. He

sounded precisely as if he thought

that the phrase was a magical incan-
tation that would confer a “presi—
dential” aura upon him. He seemed,
at best, only dimly aware of the

-content of what he was saying.

The content of the historical
allusion was nevertheless accurate,
perhaps in ways that even Bush’s
handlers did not comprehend.
Hamilton, you will remember, was
the founder of the United States
who was most consistently hostile
to democracy and fearful of the
common people.

Aproduct of the sugar—and—
slave colonies of the West Indies,
Hamilton might have been president
had he been born within the territo-
rial boundaries of this country.
Instead he became the first secre-
tary of the treasury and spent his
time defending the interests of the
bankers and merchants who were
his friends.

More than anything, this cohort
feared an actual democracy in
which numerically predominant

small farmers would use state

International Monetary
Fund — are at the heart of a system
that keeps far—flung peoples in

thrall to the dictates (or more pre-
cisely, the whims) of finance capi-
tal.

The arrogance of power remains
the same, as fiscal policy and the
attitudes of the people who make it
continue to provide an illustration
of the profound contradiction
between democracy and capitalism.
Like Hamilton, who thought that
the right-to govern naturally inhered
in the propertied alone, today’s
financial aristocracy seeks to dis-
pose of the fates of the lower orders
just as it pleases, preferably con-
sulting them as little as possible all

the while.

It was Bill Clinton’s last trea-
sury secretary, Larry Summers, who
as chief economist of the World
Bank in 1991, authored a memo
calmly arguing that Africa was
“underpolluted” and therefore
should be a serious candidate for
the world’s waste dump.

Summers’ glib global racism

_was scarcely cause for concern

among Clinton’s earnest liberal
defenders. (Remember when Toni

I arrived home much later and saw
that the ice had merely loosed its
deathgrip on the aluminum sidesof
the icebox. Brute force would be
required. Again I drew my knife.

I thought of things that piss me

seafood. I thought of all the kids who
laughed at my bifocals in third grade.
I thought of “Angry White Males.” I
started stabbing. And stabbing. The
more I stabbed, the angrier I got.

no stopping me.

Into the wee hours of that night, I
boiled pot after pot of water. I stabbed
and pried like a woman possessed. I
called knives, chopsticks and spatulas
into service. Finally, spent, I boiled a
final pot and fell into bed, soggy
socks and all.

‘Whispers’ speaks

best when it’s silent

Whispers Want to Holler
Through Feb. 9 .
Kuntu Flepertory‘Theatre

ﬁnk

HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

As many high school productions of
Shakespeare have proven time and time
again, it’s all too easy to screw up the-
ater. Unfortunately, it’s even easier
when the play in question has a political
agenda. , .

Just as the audience claps the-loud-
est forthe kid whovforgets his lines and
keeps going, theatergoers at Kuntu
Repertory Theatre’s latest production,

“Whispers Want to Holler,” will want to .

give the troupe an “A” for effort. But
though the people behind it have the
best intentions, “Whispers” falls far
short of its goal.

.3,-

« ing debate

The story starts off promisingly‘

enough. Olive Cross (Victoria Nefertari
Bey), has just returned to her
house/antique shop following the funer-
al of her son, Jordan (Nathan James), a
victim of gang violence. She barely has
time to grieve before we hear messages
on her answering machine from a com-
mittee for urban renewal, urging her to
sell her house. A

Marta J. Efﬁnger’s script, which
could have been (andtries
to be) a subtle and intrigu-
about an
African-American
woman’s sense of place,
and in turn, her place in history, instead
quickly turns into a chaotic medley of
historical caricatures whose lesson is so
blatant it’s almost an insult to the audi-
ence. . '
, Yet this struggle within the play to
give this lesson, and do it well, manages

’ to keep the audience’s interest — espe-

cially, in the second act, where the
action begins to pick up. Tasha Michelle
Smith’s role as the mysterious Little
Sallie Walker, whose unknown back-
ground story becomes the central mys-
tery of “Whispers,” almost manages to
bring her character to life with her ani-
mated voice and sassy stage presence.

  Watch

But like the rest of the cast, she simply
does not have enough to work with.
One strength of the show is the
choreography by Carla Huges. A
solemn, shrouded ﬁgure dances down
the aisle and moves sorrowfully in front-
of the funeral procession at the start of
the play, and periodically during the
show the actors -dance ' together to
emphasize the intensity of characters’
stories (a washerwoman’s
lynching, a Civil War sol-
dier’s death in battle).
Add to this an original
score by Billy Harper‘
whose emotion is far more subdued
than the script it was written for, and
you almost wish that “Whispers Want to
Holler” was a modern dance piece
rather than a play. Even Kenneth‘Ellis’s
set has a more satisfying and intriguing
symbolism. Olive’s house is ﬁlled with

‘lamps —— there is light all around her,

but she still can’t see her own impor-
tance.

So the question becomes, who can
write the right play for a group with so
much potential to inspire? As it stands,
Kuntu Repertory Theatre’s production
is most powerful at those moments
when no words are said.

It’s a ﬂash on the tube when you’re supposed to be
ﬁlling the chip bowl, beer mug or toilet bowl.

Everyone knows the myth of the Superbowl com- -

mercial. Nearly two million dollars for 30 seconds.
Watched by more than 150 million people. The failure to
live up to the hype. . .

A For Superbowl IOOCVT, a majority of the commer-
cials failed to live up the expectations of the idea of ‘The
Superbowl Commercial.” Although several did make the
cut, the bulk of them were merely lukewarm and unen-
thusiastic. ‘

The winner for “most commercials” is Budweiser,
with eight spots. The first, featuring a “Battlebots”
theme, pitted two remote driven robots T

against one another. The first looks like a
killing machine, while the other is merely" 
a mini—fridge. The machine charges men- A

acingly and pauses when the mini—fridge . -V
opens in a hazy cloud. A sole Bud Light sits there,
refreshingly cool and inviting. When the first robot
reaches a mechanical arm to grab it, the rI1ini—fridge
unleashes a mallet the size of the fridge itself and bashes
the robot into srnithereens.

Mljfe.com grabs second place for “most commer-
cials,” with its ﬁve spots. Although none of them were
particularly entertaining, the question of “What is an
mlife?” did prompt many viewers to visit the site, only to
ﬁnd that it is a new wireless service offered by AT &T.
Not too exciting. T K

The highlight of the lVl1ife.com group is a series of
belly buttons leading up to a shot of a woman giving birth

just sticks to the lesson plan. . ,
Sometimes a no-frills approach is

and the doctor cutting the umbilical cord. The screen
ﬂashes with, “We were meant to lead a wireless life.”
Several different dot—coms combined for a total of 14
Superbowl commercials. The highlights included New
York City Mayor Rudy  thanking America,
which was sponsored by Monster.com and a Yahoo.com
commercial with a talking dolphin and an island tourist.
One of the most talked about commercials this year
was for the re-teaming of Pepsi-Cola and pop princess
Britney Spears. The ad starts with Britney in
black-and-white in 1958 and features Britney
through the years — as a Supremes-esque

pie in the ‘70s; and as singer Robert Palmer
in the 80s, mocking (or paying tribute) to
his Pepsi commercial with his’. hit song 1
“Simply Irresistible.”

Finally, Britney ends
upin modern day, scanti—' I’

lot. The spot re-ran twice, once
with the whole commercial set _’
in 1958 (although eventually
bleeding to color) and the sec- 3
ond with the ﬁnal dance mon-
tage between all the Britneys.

Other prominent commer-
cials included a Lipton Brisk Iced Tea ad where
Claymation puppets riot, led by Danny DeV1to;» a
pair of “drugs support terrorism” spots; a Cadillac
ad featuring the Led Zeppelin song “Rock and

Hillbillies, rejoice! After countless
reviews of pop-rock and alternative
trios, here’s something for you.

Meet Caroline Herring, a classic
southern belle straight from the heart of
Mississippi, bringing us grassroots
country folk with a twinge of southern
religion in her debut album, Twilight.

She’ll take you on a trip to the Deep

Sunday’s sermons, all musically inter-
twined into an album that most of us
would be more than willing to leave on
the shelf. ’ ,

If the name of the album’s label --
Blue Corn Music — doesn’t clue you in
to the genre you’re about to experience,
then the ﬁrst ten seconds of the opening
track surely will, introducing you to the
folksy acoustic strums that carry on
throughout the entire album. Although
Herring has an obvious, extensive
knowledge of music, it seems to be +
for the most part — wasted in repeti-
tive, monotonous songs that all sound
strikingly similar.

The only difference comes from the
lyrics. Lyrics’ play a strong role in
Herring’s music, used as an outlet to tell
stories of her childhood and of her fam-
ily. In “Ringside Rodeo,” one of the
albums’ better tracks, Herring sings
about “playing house in her own back-
yard” and “dreams of patent leather on
a Saturday night.” The bulk of the
album follows suit, with multiple men-
tions of “mama,” “daddy,” and a
plethora of memories that chronicle
Herring’s unique childhood.

So for all of you who can appreci-

ate simple acoustic and banjo riffs _

accompanied by a mediocre alto voice
and lyrics mostly concerned with grow-
ing up as a young woman in the South,
then Twilight is just the album for you.

Okay, so you’re having a little infor-
mal _get-together at your apartment
tonight. Nothing, much, just a few peo-
ple, some good drinks and no central
entertainment to speak of — just a group
of friends set on having a good time.

So now it comes down to your
music selection. Classic rock? Nah, too
much to focus on. Everyone will be
playing air guitar to Led Zeppelin or
pondering their lives over Pink Floyd.

'Altema-rock? Nope, it’ll leave half the

crowd unsatisﬁed because they won’t be
familiar with that obscure Pearl Jam b-
side. Pop? Please spare your guests; this
is a relaxed chill-session, not a 12-year-
old girl’s slumber party. Techno? Too
abrasive: People might drop their drinks
and make a sorry attempt at breakdanc-
ing.

So what’s a host to do? Simple —
you reach for the funky jams from
California skate-boy Tommy Guerrero’s
new release Junk Collector. Guerrero’s
music can best be described as super-
chill background tunes. You’ll find noth-

The Carnegie Museum of Art’s educa-

not only studio arts majors are interested in
clay and drawing. That’s why the museum is
again offering two studio arts classes free to
Pitt and CIVIU students; tomorrow is the last
day to register for the extra-curricular cours-

“Creating with Clay” and “I Can’t

niques used in still life, sculpture and por-

traits in the galleries of Carnegie Art

“Rusty Gears, Lonely Years,” which

“Rusty Gears” is asolid arrangement of

up/down drum beats and funky basslines
that’ll put anyone in the mood to sit

continues to groove through
“Organism” and “Terra Unfirma,”

The bouncy and transcendent feel of

melodies.

The classes consist of two sessions on
the weekends and are geared toward stu-
dents who have little or no art experience.

In “I Can’t Draw” classes, students
leam how to draw self-portraits and still-life

~ sketches.

“I call it the ‘I Can’t Draw’ support
group,” instructor Kraig Lutzig said. “People
are too scared to even try drawing, so the
classes are here to offer some emotional sup-
port” .

The “Creating with Clay” classes offer
a rnessier approach. to learning about art.

Students use pottery wheels and hand
building techniques to craft vases, mugs and
dishes out of clay. . .

“I don’t give students any rules or
guidelines, only guidance,” instructor Jorge
Montemayor said. “Everyone can be cre-
ative given the chance.”

Students from all majors are welcome
to enjoy these classes.

“'Ihe free classes are a great opportuni-

for them in the "art world,” Roehrig said.
“The classes are an opportunity to bring out

KLIN/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

Guard Laine Selwyn had a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, but it

was not enough to top defending champion Notre Dame last night.

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
had its moments against defending
nationalchampion. Notre Dame last
night, just not enough of them as
Pitt lost 68-58 at Fitzgerald Field
House.

“We knew they had a, good

‘ shooter and a good inside game,”

said junior guard Laine Selwyn
about Notre Dame, -who finished
with a team high of 16 points. “We
tried to double down” in the post so
they couldn’.t get the ball to the
shooters that easy.”

One Iri_sh player burned’ the
Panthers on the inside and one from
behind ‘the arc. Irish forward
Jacqueline Batteast finished with 16
points and 12 rebounds, eight on the

‘ offensive glass.

Teammate,Alicia» Ratay had 21
points_ including four three-point-
ers. '

Pitt never took the lead in the
game, but they never let it get out of

st Fighting Irish

Senior guard Jessica Ryndycz
was hot‘ for, Pitt early on, scoring
nine of Pitt’s first fifteen points.

Ryndycz did most of her scoring
by driving down the lane, but she
was held scoreless, in the second
half. She also had an assist -and a
steal.

Selwyn tied the game at 17-17
and was fouled inside. But the
Notre Dame defense kept Pitt
shooting from the outside most of
the game, forcing the Panthers into
tough shots. The Panthers made
only three of 16 attempts from
behind the arc.

“They\were using a zone, and
it’s usually harder to penetrate,”
said Selwyn, who only made five of
17 attempts. “I pulled a’ lot of
them.” I

Backcourt mate Amy Kunich
was two for 12 from the field, but

Dame’s lead to nine as the teams

Gymnastics surprises No. 21-ranked Auburn

KEITH PARADISE
The Pitt News

One of the longest trips away from home
may turn out to be one of the best.

The Panthers gymnastics team recorded sea- .

son-high scores in all four events as they posted
an upset over No. 21-ranked Auburn. Pitt also

. battled closely with Brigham Young and the host

Missouri Tigers at the 22nd annual State Farm
Cat Classic over the weekend.

The Panthers recorded a total score of 193.05 ’

points to take third place, while Auburn finished
in fourth with 192.5. Brigham Young took the
top spot with a score of 194.95, while runner-up
Missouri finished with a score of 194.475;
Head coach Debbie Yohman returned from

the trip pleased with her team’s performance and‘

felt that the experience was a definite boost for
the ‘gymnasts.
“This is the meet that we have been needing

_to have,” Yohman said. “I think it will give us

the confidence that we need.”

Once again, sophomore Diandra O’Connor
continued to show that she has become a premier
gymnast. O’Connor competed in four events and
recorded a career—high 38.9 all-around points for
the meet, qualifying her for three events in the
individual competition, which takes the top scor-
ers in each event.

O’Connor scored a team-high 9.775 _on the,-.
vault, a new career—high, and also scored aI9.825 ;

on both the balance beam and floor exercise rou-
tines.  '

“She is showing this season that she isiexact-'

ly what we recruited,” Yohman
said. “She is a very consistent
gymnast. She performswell,
competes well and trains hard.”
In the individual competi-
tion on Saturday, O’Connor
turned in another solid perfor-
mance. On the vault, she fin-
ished in a tie for fifth place with
a score of 9.775 and finished
tied for fourth on the balance
beam with a score of 9.85. She
stumbled" a little in -her ﬂoor

swung, into first on the bars with
a score of 9.8. .
Despite having some diffi-
culties in Saturday’s events,
Yohman praised Mullin.
“She had her best meet of
the season,” Yohman said. “She

had some problems but she was- ' I

Baseball needs to return innocence to the game

It may only be the first week of February, but
I’m ready for the baseball season. And I can
think of. two teams that. are also ready: the
Montreal Expos and Minnesota Twins.

These two ball clubs are thankful just to’ have
a 2002 seasonandat least one more year of exis-
tence in major league baseball after it

league would not. contract this sea-
son. _
But that doesn’t mean baseball

‘Ever since owners voted on Nov.
6 to eliminate two teams, baseball has
shed its skin as the national pastime
and become a business monster. Talks

 

Instead, a simpler solution would be to
implement a salary cap.

There are some teams that arecompetitive
every year because theyjcan afford to buy the
high-profile players who demand more and more
money. The New York Yankees are a prime
example, as their salary for the upcom-
ing season now totals $128 million.

Teams need to be given equal eco-
nomic opportunity to ensure that any-
one could be competitive — not just
those teams in large cities. Contraction
is not going to make that possible.
Instead, it is going to abolish a team

to enrage the fans whose teams will
cease to exist.
It is going to forever change the

same.

By being so obsessed with matters of money,

baseball is alienating fans.

Commissioner Bud Selig commented that-

“The clubs recognize that our current economic
circumstances make contraction absolutely
inevitable, as certain franchises simply cannot
compete and cannot generate enough revenues to
survive.”

What I cannot understand is how contraction
is going to solve that problem. Small market
teams such as Pittsburgh are still not going to
bring in the dollars needed to compete with high-
salary teams.

game of baseball.

My family is planning a summer vacation to
Minnesota so we can see a game at the
Metrodome while it is still possible. While I con-
tinue to support baseball, I feel that as a lifelong
baseball fan, everything that I know and love
about the game is either changing or being taken
away. -

Baseball used to be fun. It used to be about
warm summer nights spent sprawledin front of
the television discussing great players of the past
and present. It was about the thrill of seeing the
players in person, getting autographs and singing
“Take Me,Out to the Ballgame” during the sev-

enth inning stretch. It was about family, happi-

-ness, relaxation and togetherness.

Now, it’s-all about the money. .

Players are identified by the amount of
money they ‘make. Teams have the ability to buy
championships. Stadiums are smeared with cor-
porate names.

Just look at Enron Field.

As the legal battles associated with the pro-
posed contraction fade away for the moment, a
new one is taking shape in Houston. The Astros
are now suing Enron Corporation because they
are afraid Enron may try and‘ sell the naming
rights without the team’s permission. The ball
club wants to buy Enron out of its current deal
and sell the stadium’s name to a new business
before the start of the 2002 season on April 2.

With opening day less than two months away,
the team should be focused on baseball, not nam-
ing rights.

Baseball needs to clean up its act before it
falls apart. It needs to focus on a more realistic
solution than contraction and find a way to give
something back to the fans who have looked past
greed and kept their adoration for the game alive.

.It needs to once again regain its status as the

— national pastime and return to a purer game not

tainted by the desire for money.

Pitt News and will further be discussing her dis-
gust over baseball ’s economic greed on the.

What to expect when youmoveoff campus

BRIAN LIBERATORE
Staff Writer

After sharing a tower wedge, show-
ering in a public stall and dining from a
tray, many Pitt students scour Pittsburgh
neighborhoods for housing outside resi-
dent assistant jurisdiction.

According to Robert Hopkins,
director of the University’s Housing
Resource Center, most students look to
off-campus housing for more privacy.
The proximity of dormitory living in
conjunction with thin walls can put
one’s personal life in earshot of neigh-
boring rooms. Most apartments have the
advantage of less concentrated living.

Also according to Hopkins, “Most
people agree you can save money [with
off-campus housing].”

An estimate from the HRC puts the
average monthly living expenses of a
student in a single bedroom or studio
apartment between $545 and $549. For
students in a two—bedroom apartment,
that cost is closer to $400. On its Web
site, the University’s Admissions and
Financial Aid Ofﬁce. reports the cost of
room and board for on—campus students
at $6,158 for two semesters or $769.75
per month.

With off-campus housing comes a
host of new responsibilities, risks and
rewards. For some landlords, inexperi-

P

enced renters are welcome prey; but a
few simple guidelines can prevent Pitt
students from falling victim to one-
sided leases, poor plumbing and lost
security deposits.

Pitt offers help for students seeking
apartments. According to Hopkins, the
HRC, located at 1-27 North Belleﬁeld
Ave. next to the Information Sciences
Building should be students’ ﬁrst stop.

The HRC offers apartment classi-
fieds from local newspapers, free
Internet and local phone access, as well
as lists of landlords and properties
approved by the HRC. The HRC also
has a Web site at wvvw.pitt.edu/~proper-
ty/hrc.html.

Hopkins said that they work direct-
ly with the landlords. “They all have to
be approved; they have to be licensed
professionals. '

“The city does not require apart-
ment inspections. [The HRC] does.”

According to Hopkins, there are a
lot of good landlords that the HRC has
no affiliation with, but students who go
this route are taking a chance.

Before searching for anapartment,
a student should have a good idea what
he or she is wants.

Students should have a list of hous-

ing priorities — size of the apartment, 5

cost, quality of the neighborhood, close-

ness to campus and- bus line access to ,

AR‘l'MENI'

name a few. Depending on the criteria,
students may have to make certain con-
cessions, but with enough.-effort, they
can find suitable accommodations.

“There are more housing options
than most people are aware of,” said
Hopkins. p

Once students have a list of possible
apartments, the footwork begins.

“Make sure you see the apartment,”
Hopkins said, “not just the building.
Apartments can vary widely within a
complex.”

When looking at the apartment, ask
questions. Find out what services the
landlord provides, the terms of the lease
and where the landlord can be reached.
If the landlord does not provide an
address or contact number, he or she
may operate as an absentee landlord. In
this situation, renters are left to fend for
themselves and problems with the
apartment often go neglected.
According to Hopkins, this is an
increasingly» prevalent scenario for stu-
dent renters. '

Once the student decides on an
apartment, he or she must sign a lease.
Renters must make sure to read the
lease carefully. Once signed, a renter is

legally bound to the terms of the lease-

If a disagreement arises between the
tenant and the landlord, the lease is the
ﬁnal word. Ignorance of a lease’s condi-

tions does not constitute a courtroom
defense.
Make sure all renters sign the lease.
According to Pittsburgh city law, no
more than three unrelated people can
live in the same house at the same time.

~ While many landlords are unaware of

this law, others renting to more than
three tenants only require signatures
from three renters.

If there are more than three tenants
and only three signatures on the lease,
those who did not sign are at risk. In the

case of an insurance claim or a legal dis- _

pute, renters not on the lease can lose
their tenant’s rights.

The lease also determines the cost
of rent. Understand what is included in
the rent —— sometimes electricity, gas,
water and parking —— and what is not.

Also, don’t pay too much.

“Be cautious of landlords who rent
by the head,” Hopkins said.

Landlords who rent this way may
charge what seems like a decent rate for
an individual but is actually an
absorbent amount for the property.

Once the lease is signed, get ,a copy.‘

According -to Hopkins, it’s never

too early to start looking for an apart-

ment. .

“My record for ﬁnding an apart-
ment is two-and-a-half hours,” ‘said
Hopkins. “That’s not typical.”

‘   Knowing your rights as a tenant

Common sense, a good lease, and
the Pennsylvania Landlord-Tenant
_Law protect your tenant rights.

Common sense is a personal
attribute requiring consistent exercise.
Obtain a receipt for payments to a
landlord or use checks or money
orders _that can be verified. Read and
understand anything you are asked to
sign. Get a copy of anything you sign.
An application to rent is not a lease
and is not binding until confirmed by
a lease. If you pay a security deposit
with the application, you may lose the
deposit if you decide not to rent the
apartment after you I are approved.
Giving notice that you do not wish the
apartment before notification of
approval should justify return of the
deposit unless specifically denied by
terms of the application or oral notice.
An administrative fee may be charged
for a credit check and would be non-
refundable.

The lease should be read, under-
stood, signed, and a copy received by
each party. It is a legal document
describing the relationship and the
obligations and prohibitions of the
relationship between the landlord and
the tenant. An oral agreement is legal,
with restrictions, in Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania landlord-tenant
law is unique but similar to other

states._You don’t have to be a lawyer
to understand the law, but a lawyer
may be helpful in asserting your rights
or protecting you from abuse.

Quiet Enjoyment is the right to
peaceful possession of the property
you leased. The landlord cannot inter-
fere with your possession and use of
the property by harassing you in per"-
son or by telephone, ‘or by entering, or
allowing others to enter, your apart-
ment without reasonable notice and
legitimate purpose such as repairs,
emergencies, or showing the apart-
ment to prospective tenants. _In addi-
tion, the landlord cannot withhold
utilities or deny access by changing
the locks. If the landlord does these
things, you should advise him/her in
writing and in person of your con-
cerns. If the condition continues, you
may seek court action to prohibit the
action or to terminate the lease agree-
ment.

Habitability means the apartment
must meet minimal construction,
maintenance, and safety standards of
the municipality having jurisdiction
(usually the City of Pittsburgh for stu-
dents). Adequate hot and cold drink-
ingv water, sewage and waste disposal,
heating, windows, doors, smoke
detectors, and bathrooms are some of
the elements that must be provided in

residential rentals. Landlords must
repair or replace those elements, and
others, when they are broken. The ten-
ant is responsible for notifying the
landlord of problems as they occur

. and the landlord is responsible for

making repairs within a reasonable
time of being notified. Making repairs
satisfactorily and within a reasonable
time are two areas that lead to dispute
and could lead to legal action. Notify
your landlord, in writing, of problems
and keep a record of your request.
Documentation is critical in legal
actions.

The landlord must give you notice
if he or she feels you are violating
your lease, if he or she wants you to
move out of the apartment before your
lease ends (eviction), oriif he or she

"plans to take legal action against you

for violating the lease. Notice allows
you an opportunity to discuss or cor-
rect the problem with the landlord, to
understand the seriousness of the
problem, and to prepare for legal
action if no amicable agreement is
reached. Many leases in this area
include a ‘waiver of “notice clause by
which you agree that the landlord
does not have to give you notice in the
situations described but may take
direct legal action as a_ ﬁrst step. This
waiver is legal in Pennsylvania if

properly given in the lease. The waiv-
er. saves the landlord two to three
weeks time before initiating legal

‘action against tenants who violate the

lease terms.
A security deposit is a sum of
money — usually equal to one

month’s rent but not more than two
months rent —— given to the landlord
as pre-payment for any apartment
damages or unpaid rent or fees that
occur during the term of. the lease.

If there are no charges, the money

must be returned to you within 30'

days of moving out. If any money is
withheld, the landlord must provide
you a written account of what was
kept and why. You must give the land-
lord a forwarding address in writing
when you move out to receive your
deposit.

A landlord may not evict you

without a valid reason, such as non- V

payment of rent. If you refuse to
leave, the landlord must begin legal
action and if the court agrees with the
landlord, it will order you to leave. If
you still refuse, the police can physi-
callypremove you and your belong-
ings. The landlord may not lock you
out or turn off water or heat in order to

force you to leave.

THE PITT NEWS RENTAL GUIDE

How to get your

security deposit back  

Your landlord must return your
deposit and/or provide you written

notice of any charges within 30-

days of your move—out.

Alf he or she does not, you may
seek recovery ofyour deposit and a
penalty equivalent to the amount of
the deposit through the courts (dis-
trict magistrate or housing court).

To recover your security deposit
you should:

Return your keys by the date:

your lease ends;
Provide, in writing, your for-

- warding address;

Remove all personal belong-
ings; ‘ , .
Clean the apartment;
Dispose of. all trash properly;
Follow any special cleaning
instructions in thetlease; and
Inspect the apartment with the
landlord if possible.
If you owe the landlord any rent

(deposits may not be used as the

last month’s rent), fees, utility
assessments or repair charges, the
landlord may deduct those charges
from your deposit and bill you if
there is an outstanding balance.
Charges must still be provided in
writing, in detail, and within 30
days. If you disagree with’ .the

charges, discuss them with the
landlord. Document your disagree-
ment and any compromise/adjust-
ment/agreement reached, in writ-
ing, to the landlord. A A

If no agreement is reached, your
last alternative for a landlord who
does not honor his or her obliga-

tions under the law is legal action. '

Refusing to pay charges in excess
of your security deposit will usual-
ly result in legal action by the land-
lord. - A - .

Security deposits are a normal

element of apartment rental. The-

Pennsylvania Landlord—Tenant Act
specifies how deposits are to be
received, maint-ained,.applied, and
returned or kept by the landlord.

Knowing your rights and meet-
ing your obligations under the lease
agreement are your best guarantees
of recovering your deposit.

‘Legal action is not the first
alternative, but it maybe necessary
if your landlord does not honor
his/her obligations under the law.

' For more information or for
specific circumstances, consult the
Housing Resource Center or seek
legal advice. V

Is renter’s insurance
Worth the cost?

You should purchase insurance
to protect your property and your
guests. Renter’s insurance is a good
idea whether you have nice furniture

and lots of expensive “stuf ,” or are .

living with secondhand furniture and
milk crate tables. Most students have

more to lose than they.,can afford to

replace. In case of fire or theft, they
are often surprised at the high cost of
replacing the TV, stereo, computer,
books, clothes, sporting goods, bicy-
cle, jewelry, eye glasses, CDs, and
other items usually taken for granted.

Renter’s insurance handles three
types of problems. Personal property
protection covers the loss of your
personal property due to fire, theft,
water damage, smoke, etc. The value
of the policy ($3000, $5000,
$10,000, etc.) sets the limit of the
compensation to you for damages.
You determine how much coverage
you want and the premium or cost of
the policy is set accordingly. The
greater the coverage, the more you
are eligible to collect and the higher
the premium you will pay. In this
type of coverage, if your $200 CD
player is 5 years old, you would only

be able to collect the depreciated,

value of the unit, not the actual cost
of a replacement. .
In order to collect the actual

replacement1i'i:o§tiofd’a1ria‘7 ed,’ to ,er- 
g P P

ty, you need to purchase a special
type of renter’s insurance called
Replacement Coverage. It covers the
actual cost to replace damaged items
as long as it doesn’t exceed the total
policy value. Replacement coverage
is more expensive than traditional
propertyprotection. If you have high
quality and/or expensive belongings,
consider buying replacement cover-

age. If not, regular coverage would.

probably be adequate. In either type
of coverage, proof of ownership and
the purchase price of major belong-
ings are recommended. A videotape
of your apartment helps to show
ownership, and receipts; either credit
card or store, will establishthe value
of the items. V

The third type of protection
offered by renter’s insurance is per-
sonal liability. If a guest, visitor, or
service worker is injured while in, or
around, your apartment, regardless
of whose fault it is, their medical
expenses are covered by your policy.-
This is important protection in case
of injury to friends or relatives ‘who
might be reluctant to sue you for
damages as ‘well as protection for
you if strangers are injured. Your
insurance coverage provides pay-

. ment for their documentable medical

or property expenses arising out of
an accident in or around your”apart—
ment. For instance, if you were at
fault for leaving objects blocking the
stairway, your insurance would pay
damages and defend you against
legal action. If the landlord is
responsible for not fixing the
handrail, for example, your insur-
ance company would pay damages

"and then collect damages from the
landlord or his/her insurance compa-

ny. If the injured person is at fault,
your insurance company would
either deny his/her claim for dam-
ages or pay and then sue for recovery
from the individual. or his/h_er insur-
ance company. _

The cost for renter’s insurance is
fairly low: $75 to $250 per year for a
policy that provides reasonable cov- ’
erage for the average student. A dis- ’
count maybe available if the insur-
ance is purchased from the same
company providing automobile
insurance or parents’ homeowners
policy. Students may even be cov-
ered by their parents’ homeowners
policy. Raising or lowering the poli-
cy’s deductible value, essentially the
threshold of damages for which the
insurance company will pay, will
also raise or lower the premium. It

says tbishdp ‘for "reiit'er-Vs’ iri§u_i_’'ai1ce, ”'

but most reputable insurance compa-
nies will provide comparable cover-
age at competitive prices.

Do you have to have renter’s

“ insurance? Be sure to read your lease
’carefu1ly.A number of landlords who .
rent to studentspinclude a “waiver of .

liability’’ clause in which they deny
any responsibility for a tenant’s
belongings or for injury to guests or
visitors. They may also stipulate that
the tenant must purchase renter’s
insurance as a condition of occupan-
cy. If these clauses are included in -
your lease and you do not purchase
renter’s insurance, you will be per-.

sonallyresponsible for the costs of; '

property damage or loss, personal”
injury liability, and legal expenses in
connection with those events, and ‘
you may be unable to collect dam-

ages from your landlord even if he or

she is partially responsible. If your

lease stipulates purchasing renter’s

insurance, you must purchase it. 1

Understanding your lease from start to ﬁnish  

This information is presented to
assist students to understand the
parts, meaning, and implications of
apartment leases utilized by area
landlords. It was notprepared by an
attorney nor should it be considered
legal advice. The information and
opinions presented are those of the
staff of the Housing Resource-

-Center who are solely responsible

for any errors or omissions. Any
questions about your legal rights as

. a tenant or possible legal action

should be discussed with an"attor—
ney.

Leases are contracts.

A lease is a contract between
you and the landlord. It describes a_
legal agreement in which you are
given possession of an apartment,
owned by the landlord, in which to
live for a specific length of time.
The lease also specifieswhat you
are to do (and not do) in order to
receive or retain possession of the
apartment.

Contracts can be long or short,
simple or complex. Contracts can
be oral but normally are in writing
in order to be enforced. Enforcing a
contract generally means asking a
court for a judgment that would
force one or both parties to do — or

not do —— whatthe contract speci-

-fies. Legal actions to enforce a

lease are usually brought to the dis-
trict magistrate but could be
brought to another court depending
upon what is being charged or what
relief is being sought.

Leases must be signed by both
parties. They do not have to be wit-
nessed, although landlords may
choose to have a staff member for-
mally witness the signature. In
Pennsylvania, you must be over 18
years old to legally sign a con-
tract. If you are under 18, the land-
lord may require a co-signer, such
as your parent, who will accept
legal responsibility for the obliga-
tions of the lease for/with you. In
the University area, many landlords
will request/require a parent to co-
sign even if you are over 18. This is
an acceptable business practice
although it may annoy the student.
Since students generally have'limit—
ed personal assets, the landlord will
be able to take legal action against
the co—signer in case the student
breaches/defaults on the lease.
Legal action can be taken across
state lines for breaching a lease.

Leases should identify the
property to ' be . rented.
Identification should include the

specific apartment they are renting
before they sign the lease. If, when
you are ready to move in, the, apart-

accept an alternate, wait in a hotel

in, take pictures or video the dam-

thorough inspection report- for the

Leases should indicate the
starting date and ending date of
the lease. Most leases in the
University area are for 12 months.
In some cases, the lease may be
open-ended or month—to-month.
Leases of six, nine and lO.months

‘ are occasionally found in this area
' but are unusual.
Many leases are preprinted or ‘

published forms on which the land-
lord fills in the blanks and then both
parties sign. The publishing compa-
ny or professional association pro-
viding the forms willlbe printed on
the bottom of the page. Preprinted
forms usually contain the basic

legal elements of a good lease and ,

document. These may be regula-‘

tions about noise, cleaning require-
ments and standards, garbage stor-
age and disposal, security issues,
smoke detectors, parties, guests,
pets, parking, hallways, lights,
landlord access to inspect or show

' the apartment to prospective tenants

' and other lifestyle issues. Rules and

regulations are often a problem
between landlord and tenant if they
are not understood, agreed to, and
followed. Tenants can be evicted for
breaching the lease by not follow-
ing these rules. Rules and regula-
tions can be changed, added to, or
amended by the landlord during the
lease without tenant approval if the
lease allows it. ‘
-Security deposits are custom-
ary in the university community.
They are usually equivalent to one
or two months’ rent. They cannot be
greater than two months’ rent. Most
leases specify that the deposit can-
not be used as the last month’s rent.
Some leases say that if the landlord
uses some or all of the security
deposit during the term of the lease,
the tenant must pay to bring the
deposit up to the lease—specified
amount. The landlord must place

RUDENIIA

the security deposit in an escrow
account in a bank for the term of the
lease-or may be bonded which is a
guarantee of payment. The tenant
does not receive any interest pay-
ments from the escrow deposit for
the first or second year. On longer
leases, interest must be paid after
the second year.

Payments of rent, also called
consideration, are specified in the
lease. Payment information will
include the monthly rent amount,
the total amount of the rent to be
paid over the term of the lease (usu-
ally l2 times the monthly rent),
when (date due) and where (office
address) the rent is to be paid, how
the rent is to be paid, (mail, in per-
son, check, money order, etc.) and a
late date after which the payment is
not on time and violates the lease
terms. Some landlords allow a dis-

-count for timely payment (rent

might be $500 a month but if paid
before the 5th of the month a dis-
count of $50 is allowed — therefore
the rent due is $450). Other land-
lords assess a penalty if the rent is
late (rent might be $500 a _month
but if paid after the 5th of the

month a penalty of $50 will charged"

— therefore the rent due is $550).
Both ways are acceptable; however,

the total amount of the contract,
which is usually stated in the lease,
will be changed depending on
whether, it is discounted or penal-
ized. If discounted, the total con-
tract amount will not reflect the dis-
count but will be the full/larger
amount. In event of a lawsuit by the
landlord, the landlord would
request payment in full for the
entire lease term which would be
the larger amount.

Utilities and appliances are
also described in the lease and
shouldbe read carefully. Who pays
which utilities should be specifical-
ly indicated. If the tenant is respon-
sible for certain utilities, they must
contract directly with the utility
company. Utilities provided by the
landlord should be listed. Utilities
include electricity, water, sewage,
and may include gas and garbage
removal. Be cautious about agree-
ing to pay the "landlord for utility
services based upon the landlord’s

‘contract. with the utility company.

While not illegal, it is a situation
which could tempt an unscrupulous
landlord to inflate charges, double
bill tenants, or charge tenants for
services the tenants did not use.
Utility companies will provide esti-
mates of -service charges for tenants

if requested and will perform usage
audits for customers who wish to
verify charges. Usually a refrigera-
tor and stove are included if the
rental unit has a kitchen and should
be referenced in the lease. Other
appliances are not usually provided.
A dishwasher, garbage disposal, or
window air conditioner would be
listed if included.

Many leases will include a use

and occupancy section that indi—_

cates the use of the apartment is
limited to residence or private
dwelling and how many people may
live there. This means it cannot be

used for business nor to house more

persons than stated in the lease.
Children in a family are counted, as
are unrelated adults. Guests may
also be restricted by language in
this section or as rules and regula-
tions. The allowance of overnight
guests or visitors, the maximum
number of nights they can stay, and
if they can be given a key to the
apartment are common limits on the
tenant’s use of the apartment.
Many landlords in the
University area will specify a right
of entry in the lease. Usually this
means that the landlord can enter

Landlord visits can
come without notice

Lease, page 12

the apartment, -without notice and
whether or not the tenant is present,
in order to fix something which the

tenant has requested, to respond to

an emergency, or to show the apart-
ment to prospective tenants. Any

’ ' limits on the time of day, purpose,

or notice will be specified here.
Leases that allow landlord access
for any reason and at any time of
the day or night should be ques-
tioned. Failure to allow the landlord
access could be grounds for the
landlord to take legal action if the
lease specifies access. Tenants are
entitled to the right of quiet pos-
session but elements of that right
can be abridged by lease.

' Renewal is the term for extend-

- ing the current lease agreement for

another period of time. Usually, a
one year lease renews for another
year and a six months lease for
another six months although some
leases will renew on a month to
month basis after the initial lease
term. In the University area, many
landlords now require the tenant to
renew their lease as much as 5
months or 150* days before the end

_ of the lease. This permits them to

advertise vacancies for the next
academic year prior to the end of
the spring term. This is a good
move for the landlord, but it could
be awkward for the student who
isn’t sure about staying in the apart-

. ment another year or even returning

to school the next year. A very early
renewal deadline also means that
the spring semester can be a series

of landlord visits with prospective
renters touring your humble abode.
While not generally as picky about
neatness as mom, visitors checking
out your closet and bathroom can
quickly become an ordeal.

Leases spell out the relationship

and requirements for both the ten-'

ant and landlord. Because the land-
lord chooses what the lease will
say, it usually favors the landlord.
If the tenant disagrees with some
part of the lease, it should be dis-
cussed and may be modified or
deleted by mutual agreement. Any
change, addition», or deletion to the
contract should be initialed by both

the landlord and the tenant(s).

Nothing said or agreed to orally
will change any part of the lease
unless it is in writing and signed by
both parties. The court will use only
the written lease to decide any legal
action brought before it. If you do
not agree to the entire, document, do

I not sign it. Your signature will bind

you to fulfill the terms of the agree-
ment exactly as it is written and/or
pay significant financial penalties.
There are no time-outs, second
chances, or.fresh starts. Landlords
will use the court or threat of legal
action to enforce the lease and ten-
ants should be equally prepared to
exercise their rights under the con-
tract and through the courts if nec-
essary.. Everyone who signs the
lease’ should receive a copy, with
signatures, to serve as a record of
the lease and each party’s responsi-
bilities under the terms of the lease.
