VOLUME XCVIH, NUMBER 143

Soldiers still march,

remember

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
‘ Staff Writer

It was April 1943, and Jesse
Knowles was hunched over, writing the
story of the “Death March” in poetic
verse. He sat in a seaof hundreds of dirty,
bloodied and hungry American soldiers
waiting out World War II as prisoners of
war being held by the Japanese in
Mukden, Manchuria. .

But he wrote about the forced trek
through the Philippine jungle of the
Bataan Peninsula like he was still march-

" ing, praying he wouldn’t pass out and fall

down. ’ A
It had been a year since he and

deaths    

months against an overwhelming

‘Japanese force invading the Philippine

Islands, had been ordered to" lay down
their weapons on Apr-i1"9, 1942 by Major
General Edward P. King, commanding
officer of the forces on Bataan. Looking
back at the brutal weeks that followed,
Knowles expressed through poetry, in
what would become his story “They,”
what he saw play out by the side of the
road north into imprisonment.

“We marched along in columns of four
Living and seeing the horrors of war
And when a man fell along the way

A cold bayonet would make him pay
For those four months he fought on

Ann Lewis pushes to “tum country around,” elect Kerry

LAURA J ERPI
Staff Writer

Upon being asked what she believed President George
W. Bush’s greatest accomplishment in office to be so far,
‘Ann Lewis had a difficult time answering.

Afterrattling otfalist ofissues she disagreeswiththe
president on, Lewis smiled and admitted she could not think
of any wonderful accomplishments by the Bush administra-
tion otf the top of her head.

“We can turn this country around [if everyone votes],”

she said. -
Pitfs College Democrats hosted Lewis, the. former
Clinton administration communications director and current
national chair for the Democratic National Committee’s
Women’s Vote Center, in the Wrlliarn Pitt Union Ballroom
Tuesday evening.

Lewis stressed the fact that Pennsylvania is a target state
in November’s presidential election. V ' A

“Connect with them; they have a stake in the election,”
Lewis said, while explaining to the audience how to encour-
age more college students to vote. “The outcome of this elec-
tion will atfect their lives.”

She emphasized the importance of young people’s votes
in the overall results of the election. Lewis told the audience

to advise their peers to vote. According to her, their encour-
agement is more eﬁective than that of anyone else.

Lewis said to pick three issues that a person is ir1terest-
ed in and explain how those issues will _be atfected by the
presidential election. She explained to the audience that peo-
ple are more likely to vote when ﬂrey believe the outcome
will affect their lives. _

Lewis spoke of many issues that the Democratic presi-
dential campaign is focusing on.

She informed the audience that Democratic presidential
candidate John Kerry has a plan to keep morejobs in ﬂie
United States. Lewis emphasized that she believes too many
American jobs are moving overseas these days.

She also said thatDemocrats would like to raise the min-
imum wage. Lewis said She does not think it is fair that so
many people are struggling to get by on the small salary

‘ earned at  wage-paying jobs.

Lewis said that the rise in health care costs is a problem
for every American family. She said the Democrats plan to
get this crisis under control.

Lewis said that although men and women are paying an
equal amount in taxes, they are still not earning equal wages.
She says if elected, Keny would like to enforce the Equal
Pay Act, passed in 1963. i /

Lewis believes that «women will play an enormous role
in the upcoming presidential election.

Lewis does not agree with the Republican approach to
education. She described Bush’s plan to improve education
as, “more tests, less resources,” something  she strongly
disagrees with. She informed the audience of the Democratic
belief that more teachers are needed in grades one through
three. She said this is the most important age, because chil-
drenarelearningtoread,andiftheydonotlearnbythird
grade, they will start to get behind in their studies.
“Education is the key to the twenty-ﬁrst century,” Lewis

elec

said. .
When talking about the issue of national security, Lewis
emphasized the fact that the Democrats believe the United
States should be a safe and secure place to live. She stressed
the importance to the country of a strong military and said the
Democrats take both international and homeland security
very seriously.

V Lewis said she was very excited" to see a group such as
the College Democrats here at Pitt. She added that this is a
great way for students to get involved in politics.

Lewis informed the audience that Kerry would be visit-
ing Pitt next Friday. Shé encouraged everyone to attend his
lecture. L

Massage lessonrelaxes and relieves finals pressure

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Staff Writer

As ﬁnals week approaches, many students are
feeling the pressure of cumulative exams and 10-page
papers mounting.

To alleviate that stress, Dr. Mary Duquin recom— .

mends a slow, relaxing.massage. Duquin, who will be
teaching a three-credit therapeutic and sports massage
class in the fall, was on hand Wednesday night to teach
a group of 27 people, split up into pairs, how to effec-
tively massage one another. The massage class was
sponsored by Pitt Program Council, as part of a series
of relaxing programs that will coincide with the
approach of ﬁnals.

“The important thing in massage is to be a good
giver of touch and a good receiver of touch,” Duquin
said. ' —

The “giver” needs to effectively massage the other
person and relax his or her muscles, while the “receiv-
er” needs to relaxand enjoy the massage, she said.

To begin, Duquin took the one partnerless person
from the group and asked her to be the demo body. .

One person in each pair was told to lie down,
belly—up, putting a rolled-up blanket, towel or jacket
under the -knees.

As Duquin proceeded to teach the massage tech-
niques, she simulated the movements on her demon-
strator.

First, Duquin instructed the givers to place their

‘hands in a resting position on the receivers’ thighs.

“Make sure your hands are very soft and molded
to the body,” Duquin said. » .
The massage began with a gentle rocking motion,

as the givers gently pushed one leg toward the other,
letting the leg rock back into position.

“Move up, and easy rock in the torso area,”
Duquin instructed.

Next, the givers rapidly rubbed their hands up and
down the legs’ and arms of the receivers to stimulate
circulation and warm up the body.

Duquin then led the group into a “shaking” tech-
nique, in which the massager took the ankle or wrist of
the receiver, extended it out, and gently shook the
limb.

“Stretch, and then vibrate,” she instructed as she
took her assistant’s arm, gently stretched it over the
woman’s head, and loosely shook it. ‘They should feel
it all the way down to their sides.” ‘

Next, the receiversﬂipped onto their stomachs and
put the rolled-up blankets under their ankles.

. Duquin put her hands, one on top of the other, on
the volunteer’s lower leg muscle. She then used her
body weight to compress her hands into the muscle,
instructing her pupils to do the same.

“Always ask your partner how the pressure is,” she
advised. “Pressure is individual.” ' .

Compression can also be done with ﬁsts, especial-
ly on the bigger muscles, like the gluteus maximus, she
said as she moved up to the buttocks of her demon-
strator and gently compressed the muscles with her
ﬁsts. ’

But not everyone immediately followed suit.

One girl gingerly put her index ﬁnger onto her
friend’s posterior, but as she looked around at the oth-
ers in the room, she tentatively splayed her hands onto
her friend’s rear end and pressed down.

“If the person feels as though they have a really

tight ass,” Duquin began — causing the room to erupt
in laughter — it means one of two things: they either
work out a lot, or they feel a little “panicky that you’re
touching their buttocks.”

-If the person was a little panicky, Duquin recom-
mended doing some slow rocking in the tense region to
loosen them up a bit. ’

Next, Duquin led the group into petrissage, a tech-
nique that is commonly used for neck massages.

Petrissage involves using the thumbs and ﬁngers to /

gently knead, compress, roll or twist the muscles.
Duquin slowly simulated petrissage throughout
the lower back, legs and arms. _
“Let’s move down to the feet,” she said, taking the
model’s foot in her hand and,,gently kneading it.
“Some people are ticklish,” Duquin observed as
participant Tracy T ilghman broke out into giggles.
Because laughing can disrupt the ability to relax,
Duquin advised moving to another part of the body or
trying to increase or decrease the pressure around the
foot to stop the tickljshness. .
Duquin then began efﬂeurage, or gliding strokes,
along the lower leg. She glided her hands up the leg
while pressing her thumbs deep into the muscle, and
then back down, easing the pressure.
After this first tutorial part, the partners switched
places, so that the givers became the receivers.
Duquin put on some low, soothing music.
“Make your intentions positive and think about
helping the person relax,” she said soothingly. “Make

them feel good. Take away their pain and stress.”

The massage began with slow rocking motions,

26.2-mile desert march difficult, despite aid

Bataan, page 1

Bataan
Then they’d kill him ‘cause he couldn’t
stand.” ’

For days, without food or water, they
were force-marched from Mariveles, on
the soutl1em end of the Bataan Peninsula
on the island of Luzon, 55 miles north to
the town of San Fernando. There, the sol-
diers were stuffed by the hundreds into
boxcars for the sweltering four-hour train
ride to imprisonment at a place known as
Camp O’Donnell. In the wake, the beat-
en and looted bodies of about 650
Americans and thousands of Filipinos lit-
tered the route. At the end of their trek,
survivors saw thousands more of their
comrades killed in short order by brutal
camp conditions.

Sixty-two years later, on March 21,
2004, Pitt student Wes Harris found him—'
self on the White Sands Missile Range in
the high desert of New Mexico to ‘com-
memorate what has become known as
“The Bataan Death March” by, of all
things, marching.

Since 1989, the Army ROTC at New
Mexico State University has sponsored
“The Bataan Memorial Death March,” in

'which participants marched a full

marathon distance of 26.2 miles. In 1992,

the New Mexico National Guard, the
200th Coast Artillery‘ of which was
among those marching through the jun-
gles of Bataan, joined in sponsorship, and
the event was moved to White Sands.

Harris, a former national guardsman
in his thirties, was one of a handful of
Pennsylvanians who joined hundreds of
others — including military, ROTC and
civilian teams from around the country
—-— in running through sandy desert trails.
in the shadow of mountains about a mile
above sea level, in order to physically
honor the torturous price paid by those in
the Philippine jungles. '

A This time, there were medics and
water points stationed all along the
course, but according to Hanis, who fm-
ished in 8 hours, 16 minutes, the assis-
tance didn’t make it much easier for him.

“I thought back to my Basic Training
days,” he said. “I said to myself, ‘26
miles? No problem! My last road march
in Basic was 36 miles, and I had at least
a 50-pound rucksack, plus an M16!’ I
neglected to consider the small but high-
ly signiﬁcant fact [that] I was 17 at the
time and had been on an intense training
schedule for the previous three months.”

Still, Harris saidihe felt invigorated,
surrounded by so many people, both mil-
itary and civilian, coming together to '
keep alive the memory of the declining

“Fortunately, in the military, histori— ‘

cal events like that are really emphasized,
so a lot of these kids who are in the mili-
tary who participated, they knew a lot
about it,” Harris said. “They knew the
depth to which these guys suffered.”

He added that the harsh physical
lessons learned by those in Bataan were
invaluable to the evolution of training
techniques for American soldiers, like
those who invaded the sandy landscapes
of Iraq last year. Last year also marked
the first time the memorial march was
canceled, due to heavy military deploy-
ment to the Persian Gulf. .

“In the pre-war Army, they didn’t
emphasize forced marchesiand physical
training like they do now, so it’s just a
testament to how far you can push the
human body,” he said.

“At least in the Army, now, you have,

even in rudimentary combat training, ‘
‘never surrender when you still have the .

means to resist.’ These guys were surren-
dered by the commanding general. They
were out of food, and almost out of
ammo, but they were still inthere for the
ﬁght. It’s really miraculous that so many
of them made it.” '

50 years after vaccine, polio almost gone

Polio — a disease for which Dr.
Jonas Salk developed the first vaccine,

here at Pitt — may be a thing of the
past. Toinmy Thompson, the United V

States secretary of Health, was guard-
edly optimistic about eradicating the

_Vl1'lJS, which used to afflict thousands,
to an

by next year, according
Associated Press report.

This news comes almost ﬁfty years
after the vaccine was first developed —
then field-tested on 1,800,000 school-

-children — and found successful, as

reported in The Pitt News on April 13,
1955. .
*”"Like' small pox, polio, in most
countries, is not a public health concern
anymore. Yet approximately 1,000
cases are reported worldwide each year,
according to Thompson, and these
might be the hardest to eliminate;
Polio’s grave effects can be seen
not only in Thompson’s and other’s
efforts to vaccinate every human on

« earth, but also in the language in which

contemporary news reports described
the first vaccine. Reports of its success
called the vaccine “the end of half a
century’s work and a victory over one
of mankind’s most dread diseases,”
according to the same Pitt News article.

Pitt prides itself on being a top-
notch research institution, and Dr.
Salkis vaccine shows that innovation
comes from investing in ideas — with

proper funding —-— and can occur any-
where, from the log cabin that stands on
the Cathedral of Learning’s lawn to the
imminent Biomedical Tower 3. When
news, especially Pitt- and Pittsburgh-
related news, seems to focus on what’s
wrong, it’s important to remember what
the University did right. ’

How many of us think about why
Salk Hall is named what it is? It’s the
building where Dr. Salk conducted his
research. How many of us think regu-
larly about the other innovations for
‘which Pitt, and Pittsburgh, are partially
responsible? Pittsburgh, after all, is not
just ketchup and steel-

And while good news about an end
to polio — with empirical evidence that
incidences of the disease are decreasing
— spreads across the globe like so

much Heinz, it’s important to remember 1
that, with all of what’s going wrong,

occasionally, things go right.

In light of other diseases, such as
AIDS, malariaaﬁd tuberculosis, which
claim millions of lives every year, it
would be utterly foolhardy to declare
humans victors over disease. As a 1955
report stated, this innovation‘, teamed
with a genuine worldwide effort to end

suffering, helped enormously. “There

can be no doubt that humanity can pull
itself up" by its own bootstraps and pro-
tect its children from the insidious inva-
sion of this  disease.” ‘

What God hath wrought: bad ring tones

We’ve probably all been sitting in class,

getting "our learn on, when someone’s cell

phone rings and’ a tinny rendition of

' “Guerrilla Radio” echoes around the class-

room for what seems like years. Inthe mean-
time, everyone wonders’ why the people
who take the time to set up per-
sonalized ring tones are the
same people who never recog-
nize the sound of their phone
 .

It’s a sort of Zen paradox;
meditate on it, and a gieatcalm
will descend upon you. Then
you may calmly walk over and
storrip the offending cell phone
into a pile of smoking "transis-

I’ll admit tonot being a
huge fan of the cell phone,
although I do enjoy eavesdropping on cell
phone conversations. Like “Seinfeld,” they
always seem to beabout nothing.

It’s reassuring to know that people are
paying to talk about things they’d never
bother to speak of face-to-face. It gives me
hope} for the future of American business.

Oh, but the ringing. There used to be a
time, around the turn of the century, when
the only people who needed cell phones
were drug dealers and, to a lesser extent,
doctors. Ring tones were simpler then, a few
beeps instantly identiﬁed those with .phones.
You heard them and knew you were in the
presence of someone important — a drug
dealer, doctor or drug dealer moonlighting as
a doctor. Those were the days of “Miami
Vice,” and they were good.

' Soon, though, The People demanded

their phones sound like a 6-year-old banging 1
on a Casio keyboard underwater. And sci-_,

ence, as is its way, made that dream a reality.
Albert Einstein couldn’t even imagine a day
when he’d be able to have “Video Killed the

Radio Star” on his cell phone; now, cus-j

tomized ring tones are as common as the

toaster oven. And as with toast, we can’t_ get

enough of them. ’ . , .
Is it too much, though? I asked myself

this question months ago, while watching
Paris Hilton’s ﬁrst video. As we all know
from CNN and ~trustfundgirls.com, the
wealthy heiress interrupts her night-vision
romp to answer her cell phone. If the plain-
vanilla sex video didn’t leave you cold, the
ramiﬁcations of that moment
should: What kind of a world

role models are so in love with
cell phones that they stop
humping — excuse me, “mak-
ing love” — to take a call?

Obviously, after all this
progress, we can’t rewind -
we’ve gone too far. But there’s
a backlash starting, and what
technology giveth, it can taketh
away.

A recent article in The
New York Times details the growing market
for gadgets that render cell phones inopera-
ble in certain locations. Casinos, sym-
phonies, churches and schools are using
them to silence those “In-A-Gadda-Da-
Vida” ring tones. There are even portable
versions that create a sphere of silence
around the user.

The FCC says cell phone jarnmers are
of questionable legality, but it’ll be interest-
ing to see if they catch on. Imagine, the next
time you’re in a crowded elevator and some-
one’s phone rings, pressing a switch that
instantly shuts it oif. Or makes it explode.
Sure, there’s an element of Schadenﬁeude in
watching "the confused cell phone user fum-‘
ble around, wondering what happened, but
more importantly, you’re able to enjoy the
blissful, awkward silence that’s unique to
elevator rides.

You might counter that, while some
people can’t wrap their heads around the
idea of vibrate mode, that doesn’t make it
fair to punish legitimate users.

There will always be rude people, and
no amount of education or selective breed-
ing williﬁx that '

Criticizing Israeli policies not intrinsically anti—Semitic

With all the attention focused on Iraq,
the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict has “quietly”
become as hot as ever. Alongside the height-
ening of the tensions, the war in the media
has intensiﬁed as well. As the conﬂict has
escalated to new highs, the war of words has
hit a new low. It has now become virtually
impossible to criticize Israel and its policies
without being forced to defend oneself from
shameless accusations of anti-Semitism.

Not unlike the view that opposition to
American foreign policy is anti-American,
broad accusations of anti-Semitism are an
attempt to discredit any author of anti-
Israeli-policy thought. Anti-Semitism con-
tinuesto be a serious issue in today’s world,

where. Exactly for that reason,
absurd assertions of anti-
Sernitism that stem from justi-
ﬁable opposition to Israeli poli-
cies, such as the building of the
wall and the occupation of the
West Bank, detract from the
gravity of actual cases of
racism.

Ai1ti—Semitism is hostility
and prejudice towards Jews.
Therefore, it is certainly anti-

unfortunate _ general failures of the
Palestinians and Arabs to create a similar
lobby ensuring the" protection of theirs_.
Those who make broad and irresponsible
charges of anti-Semitism would like-to have
you think of the Jewish people and the state
of Israel as one and the same. Then, any crit-
icism of Israel would be rendered anti-
Semitic.

Of course, such is not the case. Firstly, V

Israel was created not in a religious, but a
humanitarian context, built as a safe haven

» from persecution. Still; that withstanding,

Israel, does not —- and cannot —— act on the
behalf of all Jewish people. Many Jews, and
in fact, entire Jewish organizations, such as

V Not in My Name, oppose policies regarding

the Palestinian conﬂict for the explicit pur-
pose of detaching themselves from the
claim that they are being carried out: on the

_ behalf of all Jews.

Here in particular, the broad vicious-
ness of these accusations reveals itself. Jews
who oppose Israel’s policies ﬁnd them-
selves stigmatized by supporters of Israel as
“self-hating,” and’ it is this audacity of por-
traying Jews in disagreement as “less
Jewis ” for their opposition. that reveals
these brazen allegations to be nothing more
than reﬂexive responses to criticism of
Israel — not Jewish people themselves.

The vast majority of these accusations
then, do not really deal with the prevalence
of anti-Jewish sentiments among critics, but
rather with any views —— even those held by
Jews —’ that - are sympathetic to/ the

Palestinians. Simply put, criticism of a state.

is not a criticism of its people, its existence,
and certainly not of its religion. Is criticism
of India or Nepal anti-Hindu? Sure, Israel
has a unique history — but so does
Palestine. Does that render criticism ‘of
Palestinian tactics anti-Muslim?

What is currently taking place is
deplorable. Three million refugees live in
virtual islands of occupation without eco-
nomic viability. Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch and the State
Department of our own ﬁne country —
which gives 11 billion dollars in aid to Israel
annually —=— have criticized Israel for its
“poor” record of human rights. Are these
otherwise credible and admirable establish-
ments, anti-Semitic? This ridiculous theory
would make anti-Semites out of Nelson
Mandela and Archbishop, Desmond Tutu,
two of the world’s great humanitariaris,
Nobel Peace Prize winners and noted critics
of Israeli policies.

Issues of anti-Semitism and the entire

Middle East conﬂict certainly require great
sensitivity but they do not render anyone,

‘including Israel, immune from criticism.

Those who continue to make irresponsible
and unmerited accusations of anti-Semitism

at every voice of disagreement with policies I

pursued are themselves so blinded by their
own fervent support for Israel that they have
become unable to identify fair criticism or

FCC developments troubling

I am writing in response to Ginger
McCall’s column in the April 7 issue of
The Pitt News regarding the Federal
Communications Commission’s disci-
plinary action against Howard Stern.

I believe I can clarify the “knee-jerk
public reaction” to the current scrutiny
of broadcasters.

The real issue for many broadcast-
ers and free speech advocates isn’t the
actiontaken against Stern, or even the

 

proposed increase of the maximum ﬁne
to $500,000.

' There are several proposed regula-
tions that are far more contentious.
Among them:

Five hundred thousand dollar ﬁnes
for performers of’ indecent or obscene
material: This would go far beyond all

p previous FCC enforcements, which have

solely, targeted broadcast licensees.
Expansion of indecency/obscenity

regulation to include cable TV and satel-

lite TV and radio: In other words, even 

you wanted to pay extra to get this mate-
rial, it will be forbidden to you.
Currently, pay services are exempt from
regulation in this area.

Unprecedented ﬁnes for news pro-
gramming. While news has never been
speciﬁcally exempted from obscenity
laws, context was always taken into
account. That appears to be changing,
thus exposing news operations to FCC
disciplinary action.

In short, certain members of govem-
ment are seeking to discipline musicians

 

 

who perform material deemed profane
or obscene, prohibiting certain program-
ming whether or not carried on the pub-
lic airwaves, and limiting or preventing
coverage of news stories that involve
profane or sexual topics.

One doesn’t have to be a smut ped-
dler — or even a Howard Stern fan — to
be concerned about these developments.

Remember “The Alamo” with

The Alamo

Starring Dennis Quaid, Billy Bob
Thornton, Jason Patric, Emilio
Echevarria A

Directed by John Lee Hancock
*zi‘r7ﬁ'7ﬁ'

A scout rides up to a ruined fort,
finding hundreds of bodies strewn
throughout. He races back to the
bursting into the
encampment with cries of “They”-re
dead, they’re all deadl’’ ,

Directed by John Lee Hancock,
“The Alamo” remembers‘ the efforts
of fewer than 200 men fighting
against thousands for Texan inde-
pendence. General Sam Houston
(Dennis Quaid) sends a small unit
to the Alamo, confident that
General Antonio Lopez de Santa
Ana (Emilio Echevarria) couldn’t
possibly move his troops 300 miles
in the dead of winter. But the
Mexican dictator manages the
impossible and surprises the under-
manned fort in the spring of 1863.

Lt. Col. William Travis (Patrick
Wilson) and James Bowie (Jason
Patric) lead the 13-day defense of
the Alamo along with living legend
Davy Crockett (Billy Bob
Thornton). When Santa Ana finally
unleashes the full might of his
army, the defenders fight to the last
man.

A&E

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

Before the siege begins, the ten-,
sion among the Texans nearly
breaks into fisticuffs. Travis and
Bowie have different ideas "about
how to command the volunteers and
the regulars, creating factions in the
already small forces. But when the
cannonballs start to fly, Travis and
Bowie have to stop bickering and
work to unite the men.

The reconstructed Alamo looks
spectacular, as do the lengthy track-
ing shots through its expanse.
During the nights of siege, Santa
Ana’s band plays a tune before
artillery fire leavesthe Alamo rid-
dled with gaping holes. A highlight
of the battle scenes is a shot from
the perspective of a fired cannon-
ball. The camera sails in a great are
before the ball fills the fort, and the
screen, with debris.

Santa Ana fancies himself the
“Napoleon of the West,” and he acts
it. He pushes forward without
regard for the liveslfolflﬁishrfien/()r
civilians, desperate to conquer
General Houston’s forces. When
he’s not being ridiculously cruel,
he’s enjoying every luxury dictator-
ship can afford. _

A nasty leader is one thing, but
we see very little from his men to
contrast the heartless attitude. With
the exception of a few concerned
frowns within the ranks, Santa
Ana’s men are never humanized.

wasn’t riding bolts of lightning’or
jumping rivers, he was engaging in
a brutal slaughter

After all the gory detailsare on the
table, figures of heroism and adven-
ture suddenly seem a tad less ideal.

After the Alamo is destroyed,
Santa Ana pushes onward to destroy
the remaining Texan troops.

.Although General Houston wanted

to aid the men besieged at the
Alamo, he was more concerned
with rallying enough forces to
ensure Santa Ana’s defeat. He
delayed a dispatch of reinforce-
ments again and again, but recovers
his heroism when he moves in for
the final battle. While his victory
ends the war at last, his inspira-
tional shout‘ of
Alamo!” still feels a bit ironic.

By establishing who’s who and
what the stakes are before jumping
into battle, Hancock makes it easy
.to follow the events of the siege and
aftermath. "If considered as an
account of the Battleof the Alamo
from the Texan perspective,’ “The

bravery of the men that fell for their

Holland, a country where one person
indulges in 5 pounds of the candy per
year, one can order Beehive Honey

rights to the extract of that sweet V  I

licorice root?

It’s time to make up for all
those years» of candy forgery. And
,than,k_s to Licorice International,
National
Confectioners Association, that
time has come in the form of
April 12, also recognized as
National Licorice Day. _

Celebrating‘ the day of this
wonderful extract, which is used
as ﬂavoring in food, tobacco,
alcohol and cosmetics, starts with
a Visit to the Web site of Licorice
International, Inc.

~.Since its founding in 2002,
the site has offered the largest
selection of licorice candy in the
United States, all of it made with
the extract of the licorice root.

There is even sugar-free licorice, or, if
your taste buds crave something differ-
ent, salt-ﬂavored licorice from Finland.
Who knew that the licorice plant,
which is essentially a weed, could pro-
duce such a variety of treats?
For National Licorice Day, one
I should also
consider the
health ben-

Licorice — the candy that “makes mouths happy”

eﬁts of the candy. Since the 14th centu-
ry, the root’s extract has been used to
soothe respiratory ailments, such as
bronchitis and the everyday cough and
cold. On the site, for example, one can
order a tin of Lakerol, a Swedish
licorice pastille that includes menthol,
but leaves out the sugar found in other
cough soothers.

Research has also shown that

- licorice can relieve pain associated

with certainxtypes of ulcers and is very

beneficial for the adrenal glands.
Recently, an assistant professor of
food sciences at Rutgers Cook
College found that certain molecules
in licorice can even help to stop the
growth of both breast and prostate
cancer cells. This is not unusual, con-
sidering the Chinese have used the
licorice root for years to subdue can-
cer.

So on April 12, exercise your right
as a licorice lover. Take a few min-
utes to stop at the Licorice
International, Inc. Web site and order
one of their many licorice variety
baskets. If not, try finding a box of
the American—made Good & Plentys
at the local candy shop. Not only are
these treats good, but also they’re
good for you ‘(sorry for the tired
cliche).

What’s the deal with television com-
mercials today?

Why should I care to watch these
boring, rarely funny advertisements?

There are very few funny commer-
cials today — deﬁnitely not enough to
keep me in my seat when “Pardon the
Interruption” goes ' to a commercial
break.

The only time they are watchable is
during the Super Bowl and, nowadays,
the ones shown during the big game
aren’t that appealing —— at least, not like
they used to be.

But the people at American Express
have hit the jackpot in the world of adver-
tising. Instead of having the commercial
come to the audience via the television,
they thought it’d be a great idea to have
the audience go to them, via the Internet,
to the commercial.

Who would ever want to take their
time to seek out a commercial —— and a
four—minute commercial at that?

Your answer right now is probably,
“Not me,” but you have to reconsider that
first notion, because it is actually a good
idea. And the way American Express
went about it made it even greater. -

American Express created a four-
minute commercial featuring its favorite
comedy duo, Jerry Seinfeld and

Superman — or Man of
Steel, as he’s referred_to in
one scene of the commercial.
The two were originally
used in a 1998 television‘
commercial for American
Express. It received great
reviews and, finally, the

 

no Newman . — and
Superman is basically
Kramer with a red cape.
The four-minute com-
mercial could obviously
never air on television — 30-
second time slots are expen-
sive enough. So the ﬁrst

super-crew is back — this
time in a more entertaining
role in an Intemet-based ad.
The commercial features
Seinfeld and Superman
going into a restaurant and
talking. They then walk .
down the sidewalk and chat about a the-
atre review when Seinfeld’s new, boxed-

up DVD player is stolen out of his hand. .

The commercial goes on,,butI wo1_1’t ruin
the ending for you. , .A by ‘I— _ .

The great thing about the commer-
cial is the American Express card shows
its face for about ﬁvefiseconds of the
whole commercial. _ I
tised and doesn’t 
non—stop comedy. "

   

 
  

What’s funny about the commercial?-.‘_

Well, it’s a commercial" about nothing.
Absolutely nothing. Much like Seinfeld’s
ever—famous sitcom that I miss clearly, as
do many of my friends. This commercial

has all the elements of the show, except ’

No more need to ask, “What’s the deal with commercials?”

talk shows have guests who are promot-
ing commercials? Generally, there are
promotions for movies and albums. But
commercials?

And by Seinfeld appearing on these
shows and promoting the four-rninute
commercials, he is in essence giving
American Express more advertising.

It’s brilliant.

- Seinfeld talked about how he made
Superman act the way he thought he
would. He explained how he thought
Superman was all sugarcoated on the out-
side and that he’s really not with it when
it comes to brains.

No matter how smart Superman real-
ly is, this makes for a great humor and a
great commercial —+ and maybe a great
movie. _   .
But when Seinfeld was confronted
' with the" question of whether there would
be ‘a'Seinfeld. and Superman movie, he

I

 responded with histypical, ‘.‘Eh,” and

 eshrug'ged‘—— the same way he shrugs off
«the possibility of another episode of
‘“'Seinfeld”' being created.

I - All we, «as Seinfeld fans, can do is
hope American Express can talk him into
doing a 30-minute extra episode of
Seinfeld with ﬁve to ten seconds devoted
to the actual credit card and the rest being
about yada, yada, yada.

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA/CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

The Pitt defense wraps up a Rutgers player during the 2003 season. After struggling last season, the defense looks to be in
shape to return to dominance, holding Pitt’s offense in check in spring practice.

Pitt defense still in control

MATT MILOSZEWSKI
Staff Writer

The final day of spring ‘practice
brought much of the same for the
Panthers’ football team. The defense
continued its dominance and the
offense continued to slowly take some
strides in the right direction.

“The defense is getting even more
consistent,” said Panthers’ head coach
Walt Harris. “As we expected, the
defense is ahead of the offense.”

The only big offensive highlight
forthe Panthers was a long run by
Jawan Walker. Walker broke off left
tackle, cut back to the middle and
exploded for a 30-yard gain. Walker
was caught from behind by linebacker
Malcolm Postell. That was the lone
offensive bright spot for the day. The
resulfiof Walker’s run, though, was not
so pretty. » I

' Following the run, the offense was
held to a field goal attempt, and the
placekicking squad had not been doing
well. For the second consecutive prac-
tice, a field goal attempt was blocked.
This attempt was not only blocked, it
was swallowed up" by several defend-
ers.

“We get that energy, kind-of like
we have to make up for giving up

yards. Once we get our minds made-

up, it’s like all these ‘points matter,
now let’s go get this,” said linebacker
Clint Session, a member of the defense
and fieldgoal block team. '

The defense seems to have their
minds made up, and so does Session.
Last season, Session was known for
his explosive hits that occurred spo-
radically ‘throughout the year. This

year, heiwill be known as one of the .

starting inside linebackers. “It is a
good feeling [being the starter],’’
Session said.

Session has some big shoes to ﬁll.
The past two years, the Panthers. have
graduated two big-time inside line-
backers in Gerald Hayes, now in the
National Football League [NFL], and
Lewis Moore, .who graduates this
spring. " .

\ Session, could be one of the two
starting inside linebackers, along with
fellow sophomore linebacker H.B.
Blades. The linebackers have also
impressed coach Harris during the
spring. .

“The linebackers have played a lot
better,” said Harris. '

The spring has helped the coaches
evaluate some players,° but notall of
them. The ability to evaluate the quar-
terback has been taken away from
Harris and his staff because of an
injured offensive line. “It is so hard to
evaluate with so many guys out,” said
Harris. -
Harris’ final chance to get a look at his
players will take place this Saturday at
1 p.m. at Heinz Field. *

The scrimmage will showcasethe
first-team offense on the same team as
second-team defense,an'd vice 'versa.

Offensive players will wear white, and
defensive players will wear blue.
Because of injuries, some players will
have to play on both teams. Players
such as Greg Lee. and Princell
Brockenbrough, both favorites to be
starters at wide receiver, will be out.
Also sitting out Saturday’s game due
to injury will be starting left tackle and
all-American candidate Rob Petitti.
The injuries are especially preva-
lent on the offensive line, where ﬁnd-

ing 10 healthy bodies might be difﬁ--

cult. “We might have 10 healthy guys,
but they can’t be labeled _offensive
linemen quite yet,” Harris said.

Other things .to watch for will be

new players trying to win ‘starting
positions. ‘ .
“Look for who the new players will
be, and how the old players have
improved from last season. [The fans]
will see some new guys [who] are very
exciting, too,” Harris said.

Players like Josh Lay, who is look-
-ing win a starting comerback job, have
been playing well all spring.

“The , defensive ' backs, like -Josh
Lay, have played very well, but have
not been tested,” said Harris.

This scrimmage will be very
important to Harris and his staff
because, “No starting jobs have been
solidified,” according to Harris.

Thespring game will be free to all

« students who show their Pitt ID, and

will start at 1 p.m. on Saturday at
Heinz'FieYdI ' ' ‘ ' ' ‘ ’ ‘ ' ' ‘ ' ’ ' '

Baseball
should put

on a cap
39%

  

1

It’s nothing to obsess over, but
it is an important step in the right
direction. Major League Baseball
announced the” other day that the
average salary of its players is
down 3 percent this year from last
season, marking the first time since
1995 the year after the strike -
that salaries have decreased.

It’s not a big decrease, but it’s a _

start.’ The average salary in 2003
was’ $2.56 million and this season it
is $2.49 million. One might think
baseball players make the most
money of any athletes because
there is no salary cap, but that’s
where most people go wrong with

baseball.

In actuality, basketball players
average the most money, averaging
$4.9 million this season, almost
double what baseball players make.
And to make that figure even more
staggering, basketball somehow has
a salary cap. L

This leads to the question of
whether the Yankees are bad for
baseball because of their free
spending.

Last night, ESPN held a mock
trial of this hot topic with well-
known lawyerlAlan Dershowitz
heading the prosecution team. I

' hate the Yankees more than anyone

else, but they certainly are not bad
for baseball. nor are they doing a
single thing wrong in buying cham-
pionships. ‘

As for what I said before —
about basketball having a salary
cap and still paying its players
twice as much as baseball —— it just
proves that a salary cap can be
reached in America’s pastime. The
cap can be set at somewhere near

UConn becomes the
center of college hoops

ADAM CAPARELL
The Daily Campus (U. Connecticut) _

(U-WIRE) STORRS, Conn. — It’s
been an historic few days in Storrs,
Conn. A new precedent in college
sports has been set.

The Connecticut men’s and
women’s basketball teams have
each won a national championship
and have immortalized themselves.

The past few days will go down
in the lore of Connecticut sports as
one of the greatest, if not the great-
est, moments.

The men took home their second
national championship with their
82-73 victory over Georgia Tech in

_San Antonio, while the women

earned their third straight title, and

' fifth title overall, with their triumph

over archrival Tennessee, 70-61. _

The dual nine-point wins meant
UConn became the first school in
Division I to have both their men’s
and women’s teams reach and win
the national championship game in
the same year.

UConn also became the fifth

_preseason No. 1. The men, who hit

in the same season, the most recent
being Texas last year.

But Texas, Duke and the others
have failed where the Huskies did
not. /.

“It’s so mind-boggling,” UConn
women’s coach Geno Auriemma
said. “An unbelievable accomplish-
ment for a school. I don’t think
there is one single person in
Connecticut that isn’t unbelievably
proud of our two basketball pro-
grams.” _

Both the men and women kicked
off the season in November as the

some bumps along their road that
caused them to drop as far down in -
the national rankings as No. 8,
became the first preseason No. 1 to
win the national championship
since Kentucky in 1996.

That’s no small feat. The pre-,
season No. 1 tag has been a jinx,
especially in the men’s game. But
the Huskies overcame all the expec-
tation and hype that weighed on the
men all year long. I

“From September, we had folks

school to have both men’s and
women’s teams reach the Final Four

Older fans need to get out of the way of the younger ones

When I was about 12 years old, I went down
to the late Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia with
my little brother, dad and neighbor to see the
Phillies take on the Dodgers. I was sitting along
the first base line when a foul
ball came my way. It was a ,,
line drive so it bounced off an S  ‘ '1
empty seat and rolled towards
me as I was standing in the
aisle.

When my hand was just
about on what would have
been the only baseball I
would have ever gotten at a 
game to date, I felt a force hit
me in the back. I ﬂew to the
ground, hitting my head on the metal railing in
the aisle. ~

Where was the ball I almost had?

It was in the hands of a large, middle-aged
man who had knocked me to the ground. He held
the ball high in the air, showing his newly
acquired ball. .

Needless to say, everyone around the section
who witnessed this. began to shout obscenities at
this man.

So why am I reminiscing to you right now?

Because I witnessed something at the Pirates
game Wednesday night that reminded me of this.

A group of kids, ages ranging from 7 to 12,

were standing. by. the. field yelling to -players,..

, / r , / . I . / « »

  
  

holding their baseballs up high, asking for auto-
graphs.

It’s the dream of every little boy who goes to

a ballgame.

W EW

At one point before the
game, Dave Littlefield, the
Pirates’. vice president and
general manager of baseball
operations, came out onto the
field. Agroup of kids gathered
and patiently held their base-
— balls out as Littlefield signed

_ , them one by one. ,
 After about a minute of
signing, an older teenager
makes his way into the pile and
starts yelling, “Hey Dave! Dave! Dave!” ‘

Littlefield looked up at him and gave him the
signal to quiet down and wait his turn —-— and left
before signing the teenager’s baseball.

Officer Frank Rende of the Pittsburgh Police

“$§$:‘N’-

Department, who works at Pirates home games‘

during the week,_ said there have been several

,instances where-older men are pushing smaller

kids out of the way for autographs or foul balls.
This is not how it is supposed to be.

' A baseball game is supposed to be a great
game for fathers to take their sons to. And every
little boy out there should have a fair chance at
getting the ball.

. - . .So guys, think a li.ttle more about what you’re

r.v,.r«

/,,«;/V-"

doing at these games. -

Think of why you are at the game" now and
why you were at these games when you were lit-
tle. '

Think of how much more that ball means to
someone much younger than you.

Many times,’ kids don’t even know who is a
baseball player and who is not.

They really don’t care if it is an All-Star who
signs the ball or a utility infielder who may get 30
at-bats if he’s lucky. It’s just the fact they got one.

One exception to this,; as there always seems
to be at least one for everything, is if the ball you
caught or could catch has some significance —
like Barry Bonds’ 73rd home run ball. Buteven
still, «by exception, I mean you have a right to hold
onto that ball — not knock over ten kids and a hot
dog vendor to get to it.

I’ve resigned myself to the fact that I’ll prob-
ably never get the chance to catch a baseball at a
ball game and many others should come to this
realization. . .

They should sit back in their seats and just
watch the game.

I And if a ball comes your way, look for the

nearest kid sporting an oversized baseball glove. A

He wants it more than you.

Salary cap would bring Yankees’
spending back to rest of baseball

Goldman, page 15

$100 million; this way the average
salary on a 25-man roster could be
$4 million, over $1.5 million more
then the average player makesright
now.

As with anything in this world,
this’ type of cap would settle issues

and cause problems at the same -

time.

Heading into the 2004 season,
the Milwaukee Brewers had the
lowest team salary, at $27.5 mil-
lion, while the Yankees were th
highest,’at $183 million. *

So as you can see, the Yankees
would never have been able to
afford Alex Rodriguez under such a
cap, but the Brewerswould be up a
creek without a paddle since they
«would only spend a quarter of what
a cap would be.

1 Hang with me ‘because I have a
point here. It all stems back to
E,SPN’s “Yankees on Trial”. The
Yankees haveeevery right to spend
the amount of money they want,
same with the Brewers. But with a
salary cap that amounts, .per player,
to more than the average player
makes now, the Yankees can still

>25
8%

at

outspend the Brewers by $73 mil-
lion and field ‘an amazing’-team.
The major difference would be
the fact that teams like Boston,
Baltimore, Toronto and other
American League teams could
spend"the same amount as the
Yankees and not be outbid every

year, making competition better.

In this type of salary cap sys-
tern, only owners with the desire to
spend money and go after players
could win, much like in basketball,
in which only teams ‘ like
Sacramento, Los Angeles and San
Antonio win because their respec-
tive owners go out and spend, while

- ‘staying under the cap. \

Meanwhile, teams like the
Pirates and Brewers can continue to
piss off their respective fans by not
spending money, and finishing last
every year. _ .

As -much as I hate to say it,

‘don’t blame the Ya-nkees~ for their

success‘; blame the system.

a very difficult thing to do.”

\’ The women _had their struggles
also, losing four games and falling
in the Big East Tournament for the
second "straight year.

“We don’t even understand the
magnitude of our own win,.let alone
what both programs have accom-
plished in the same year,” Maria
Conlon said. “Hopefully, in a cou-
ple of weeks, when we settle in,
we’ll understand how special this
1s.” -
It’s going to be tough, if not
downright impossible, for a repeat
performance in 2005.

The women will lose the great-
est player in the program’s history,
senior Diana Taurasi, to graduation
and the WNBA. Conlon and Morgan
Valley will also graduate, and their
invaluable post-season experience
will follow them out the door.

The men will look decidedly
different, also.

Emeka Okafor is as good as
gone, considering that the junior is
graduating this May and has noth-
ing to lose but the boatloads of
money the NBA will offer him come
the June draft. Junior Ben Gordon
will likely follow Okaforafter his
performance in the NCAA
Tournament.

Taliek Brown will be gone,
Charlie Villanueva might bolt for
the NBA, and the Huskies will have
a much younger team.

The 2004-2005 season won’t
begin for another seven months.
Talks of a repeat will be tossed
around, but everyone associated

' with the two teams is just basking in

the glory of their monumental wins.

“When our basketball program
became successful, our fans’ expec-
tation level was to win champi-
onships,” Auriemma said. “Right
now, I don’t think there is a single
person in Connecticut that isn’t
unbelievably proud of our two bas-
ketball programs.”

“You know we just made histo-
ry,” said Gordon. “After we’re dead
and gone, we’re still going to have

.this,national championship banner.

We just kind of immortalized our-
selves. You know, this is one of the
best feelings I’ve ever had in my
life.”
