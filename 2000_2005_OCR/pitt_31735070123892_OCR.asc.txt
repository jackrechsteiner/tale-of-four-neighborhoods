Pitt students’ reactions to next fall’s \

FY03 budget includes

he University’s ﬁscal year
2003 operating budget
includes the largest Pitt

"tuition hike since 1978- 14

percent for Pennsylvania resi-
dents and 10 percent for out—of-
state students in most schools.
Those increases bring the
tuition rate for in—state under-
graduates in the College of Arts

hand Sciences to $7,868, or

$966 more than last year’s rate.
Tuition ‘for out-of—state CAS
students will increase by $1,516,

to maintain academic quality..
“Making-a decision to increase

tuition is never easy, and making»

a decision to increase tuitionby
this amount certainly is nothing
that we take lightly,” Chancellor
MarkNordenberg told reporters
following theJuly 15 meetings of
the trustees’ ‘budget and ‘execu-

~ tive committees, which gave ﬁnal

approval to Pitt’s $1.17 billion
FY2003 operating budget. _
‘fWhat drives this more than
anything is our continuing com-
mitment to quality,” Nordenberg
said. “We do believe that nothing
is more important to the future
of the institution, nothing is
more important to the students
of this University, than that

,we sustain our momentum and

keep making the investments
that improve Pitt’s‘ position _in
American higher education.”

_ Those investments and I
improvements will include the
following this year:

° $13.4 million for faculty
recruitment, curriculum updates,
freshman instruction programs,
counseling and.placement ser-
vices, and recreation and security
initiatives.

0 A $10.1 million investment
in research infrastructure.

° Money to, ‘offset-$4.2 1nil-
lion in new operating expenses

1 In addition, Pitt will increase
the pool of salary money by 3.5
percent to help the University
compete for high—quality faculty
and staff, Nordenberg said.

14% tuition increase

Compensation is the University’s
biggest expense, representing
nearly 60 percent ($692 million)
of FY 2003 spending.

Pitt will cut certain, yet—to—
be—deterrnined units’ budgets by
a total of $8 million this year,
the chancellor said. Other cost-
cutting measures, he said, will
include reﬁnancing some of
Pitt’s long—term debt, taking
advantage of group purchasing
rates through preferred vendors
and an Internet ‘procurement

system, and energy conservation -

to. offset the University’s rising

' To help offset next fall’s
tuition hikes, Pitt budgeted $9
million more for ﬁnancial aid
for a total of $89.3 million,
Nordenberg said. .

Additional scholarships,

academic endowments‘ will be

' provided’ by the University’s

capital campaign, he noted. The
campaign recently exceeded
its $500 million goal, prompt-
ing Pitt leaders to extend the
campaign and raise the goal to
$1 billion.

following last week’s meetings of _

the trustees’ budget and execu-

3.5 percent investment will help
us to remain competitive.”

But it won’t do much to help
Pitt close the gap in competing
with private universities for top

faculty,ihe added.

“One reason we have made 0

salaries such a priority is because

we ﬁnd that the University of

Pittsburgh, along with many

WANTED: Faculty and
staffvolunteers to help ease
the transition of incoming
freshmen into on-campus
housing.

From Aug. 21-24, thou-
sands _of Pitt students will
swarm Oakland for the often-
exhausting process of moving
in for the upcoming semester.
The only thing standing in
the way of chaos and long
lines of trafﬁc in Oakland is
an armual volunteer program
called Arrival Survival.

Approximately 45 0 student
volunteers and 50 faculty
and staff volunteers will help
parents and students- to unload
luggage and will direct stu-
dents to their new living
quarters. Volunteers also will
provide entertainment and
food and drinkin the Schenley
Quad area for students and
parents.

trafﬁc will create more space
for unloading. “From 9 a.m.

- to 3 p.m., Bigelow Boulevard

between Forbes Avenue and
Fifth Avenue will be closed off
and used as an unloading area
for students in the quad area
dorms,” said John T. Morgan
of the Department of Parking,

Transportation and Services.

“Schenley Quad will also be used
for unloading.”

Meters along Forbes Avenue
willbe bagged and the parking
lane will be used for cars that
are lining up to be unloaded on
Bigelow, Morgan said. , »

“Last year we had no backups
on Forbes Avenue or Fifth
Avenue" and we hope to see
the same results this year and

eliminate trafﬁc for parents and .

students,” he said.

Morgan estimated that
Arrival Survival assists more
than 4,500 students and parents
each year.

Pitt has been offering this
type of program_ for years,
he said. .

“I’ve been here for 10 years
and it’s been going on every
year that I’ve been here,” .
Morgan said.

Arrival Survival 2002 has
enough student volunteers, but
staff and faculty volunteers are
still needed. Each volunteer
will receive an Arrival Survival

Students’

ozens of Pitt undergrad-
Duates have telephoned
and e—mailed the Student
Government Board ofﬁce to-

protest next fall’s tuition hikes
of 14 percent for Pennsylvania

out-of state students, said SGB
President Kevin Washo Jr.

“I’m sure we would have
gotten a lot more feedback if

this had happened in the spring ’

or fall,” he said. “Students are
frustrated, they’re upset and you
can’t blame them.”

Following theJuly 15 trustees
meetings, Washo announced that
he had sent letters to student lead-
ers at Pitt’s regional campuses,
the 14 State System of Higher
Education schools, Penn State
and other state—funded universi-
ties, inviting them to convene
soon to discuss forming a Penn-
sylvania Student Association.
Working with campus adminis-
trators and state legislators,
the association would strive “to
protect the rights of students and
make our education affordable
again,” Washo said.

SGB also is planning a drive
to register 3,000 Pitt students to
vote in Pennsylvania’s upcoming
gubernatorial election, Washo
said. “We also want to work with
the University’s governmental
relations staff, to determine
how students can become more
involved in Pitt’s lobbying efforts
in Harrisburg.

“It’s easy for legislators to
shift the state’s ﬁnancial burden
to college students when they
believe that most Pennsylvania
residents aged 18-to-22 don’t
vote, out-of-state students aren’t
eligible to vote here, and students
don’t contribute much money
to election campaigns,” Washo
pointed out.

Washo said he will work more
hours and borrow more money
next year to pay his own, higher

tuition bills. “I feel frustrated
by these increases, just like any
other student,” he said.

reactions to tuition hikes vary  

= ’ But Washo isn’t blaming Pitt
administrators and trustees.
“I believe that this [tuition
increase] is the result of the
state undermining the efforts
of universities across the com-

~ students’ »~and«- 10" -percent-Lfewigmrngénwealtzhg-’3-hesaid+5‘I-thiirktslré‘* *

administration and the Board
of Trustees were put between a
rock and a hard place, and did
what they had to do to keep our
university competitive.

“I wish tuition weren’t going
up by so much, but unforttmately

that was the only way We could‘

compensate for the[3 .7 percent]
cut in state funding” for the ﬁscal
year that began July 1.

D

While trustees were meeting
in 2P5 6 Posvar Hall to approve
Pitt’s budget on July 15, about a
dozen protesters stood outside
the building, holding signs
such as one that depicted a
-tiara-wearing Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg._ '

“Welfare Queen?” the sign
read, continuing: “The chancel-
lor just got an $18K raise [editoriv
note: actually, a $17,500 raise]
this year, and he still can’t ﬁgure
out howto pay a ‘Living Wage
& health beneﬁts for all without
the students’ _help.”

Unlike SGB’s Washo, the
protesters blamed University
senior administrators and trust-
ees for next fall’s double-digit
tuition increase — as well as for
Pitt’s denial of health beneﬁts to
employees’ same-sex domestic
partners, and for paying some
staff less than the minimum
living wage for Allegheny County
workers as recommended by
Pitt’s University Center for
Social and Urban Research.

Only a handful of students
were admitted‘ to ZP56 Posvar
Hall for the public meetings of
the trustees’ budget and execu-
tive committees, and a few were
turned away. One reason for this
was the large turnout of local
print, radio and TV reporters,
who were given precedence in

seating. But in addition, the
number of chairs_provided for the
public was half ofwhat it normally
had been for governance group

meetings in 2P56 Posvar — 5
including -previous meetings
-of~ trustees" c(7)mrr1iftees.~ Stand‘-

ing room attendance was not
permitted. .

“The primary reason [for
eliminating seating on both sides

' of the room] Was, they didn’t

want people passing in back of
the leadership -— the chancellor,
the chairman of the board, the

chairman of the budget comrnit- A
tee — during the meetings,” said .

Robert Hill, vice chancellor for
Public Affairs. ~ ' ‘ -»
El .

Students’ reactions to the
double-digit increases were
inﬂuenced, not surprisingly,
by the students’ own ﬁnancial
circumstances.

“Currently, since I am not
paying for my tuition and am
not having ﬁnancial difﬁculty,
the increase does not personally
affect me,” said Leah Crutcher,
19, a sophomore biology and
Spanish major. “I feel that
the tuition hike was necessary
in order to contribute to the

new basketball arena and other 1

recently constructed buildings.
As a student, I feel that the new
arena will bring the students
together more. I believe that
going to Pitt is well worth the
tuition.” V
Rebecca Gorczynski, 20, a
senior psychology major, said
she. did not know much about
the increase because her parents

pay her tuition. Nevertheless,

Gorczynski was concerned about
how tuition revenue will be
spent. “It seems that the things
that they are using the money
for are only improving the
outside appearance of the school.
Meanwhile, I know that the art
department needs new equip-
ment,” she said. ’
Kevin Koleszar, 21, a junior
computer science major, also was

unconcerned about the tuition

, hike. “Personally it’s not going

to affect me very much because
I have ﬁnancial aid,” Koleszar

said. “I am only going to have

to pay a couple hundred‘ dollars

- —~~3mefwﬁa   ~

» Koleszar, who commutes

from home to save money on

room and board, joked that he
came. to Pitt because “it was
close, it was cheap, and they
actually took me.”

For others, Pitt’s tuition has
become anything but cheap.

“I personally don’t like the
tuition increase because I am an
out-of-state student and am now
paying upwards of $2 0,000,” said
a senior philosophy and political
science major who’ wished to
remain anonymous. “With the
money [University adrninist:ra-
tors] bring in with sponsors I
ﬁnd it weird that they have hiked
tuition so greatly over the last
several years. I was considering
transferring but I’ll stick it out
because some of my credits
might not transfer.” -

Autumn Forrest, 23, a senior
ecology major, sympathized with
Pitt’s budgetary plight but added:
“The extra money [to cover the
tuition hike] is coming out of
my. own pocket.” Forrest, who
commutes, is thankful that she
is a senior and needs only a few
credits to graduate. “It would be
extremely hard for me if I were
going back to school full-time,
fall semester,” she said. 1

Jumoke Davis, 2 8, a freshman
media journalism major, said he
understood the need to increase

tuition but believes that students

should have more say in‘ how
tuition money is used. “I would

. like to know where the money

is going,” said Davis, who com-
mutes to campus from Highland
Park. “The students should be
theones to decide if their money

will ﬁnance the new basketball’

arena.”

JULYZS, 2002 .

. FY03 budget includes

14% tuition increase

C ONIINUED FROM PAGE 1 ,
years ago, Nordenberg noted
that Pitt’s endowment spending

-policy is based on a three—year, A

rolling average of endowment
income. “It’s designed to see us
through good times as well as
bad,” the chancellor said.

Nordenberg said that despite
declining state appropriations,
Pitt has no intention of going
private —_ for example, through
a series of double-digit tuition
hikes, gradually weaning the
University away from depen-
dence on state support (the
scenario that one reporter sug-
gested). ' .

Nor was Pitt trying to send

‘a message to state lawmakers by

raising in-state tuition by a larger

-percentage than out—of—state

tuition, the chancellor said.
“The decision to differentiate

‘ between in—state and out—of—state

students was driven both by a
sense of equity and a knowledge
of the marketplace,” Nordenberg
told reporters. Pitt doesn’t want
to risk pricing itself out of the
market for out—of—state students,
he said.

That’s why not all Pitt schools
will raise their out—of—state
tuitions by 10 percent next fall.
Tuition for graduate students

‘ in the schools of nursingand

pharmacy actually will be reduced
by several thousand dollars next
fall, as will tuition for i,out—of—

state students in the School
of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences professional programs.
Out—of-state tuitionwill increase
by 5 percent for ﬁrst professional
students in dental medicine and
for graduate and ﬁrst profes-
sional students in the medical
school. ,

At Titusville, tuition will go
up by 11.2 percent (in—state) and
7.3 percent (out-of-state).

“Competitive market forces”
drove Pitt’s decisions to impose
lower tuition hikes at Titusville
and in the Health Sciences
programs, said Robert Hill, vice
chancellor for Public Affairs. _

, -D ,

At this point, N ordenberg
argued, Pitt is not at risk of
pricing itself out of the market for
in-state students seeking a high-
quality university education.
Despite last year’s 7.5 percent
tuition increase and next fall’s
double—digit hikes, Pitt remains

‘ a bargain for Pennsylvania resi-

dents, the chancellor said.
Pitt administrators consid-

ered— but rejected — the idea of V

increasing tuition for incoming
students by a higher percentage
than for returning students, as
a growing number of universi-
ties .»(including Penn State and

Carnegie Mellon) have done in,‘

recent years. “I would say that

the future,” Nordenberg said.
“Our best judgment right now,
though, was to stick with a
constant tuition rate for the
students who are enrolled in
the same programs and not to
differentiate”'between incoming
and continuing students.

Pennsylvania continues to
rank third from the bottom
among states in per capita spend-
ing on higher education. Nor-
denberg was asked: ‘How long
can that trend continue before
Pennsylvania begins. losing resi-
dent students to universities in
other states?

“I can’t really answer that
question,” he replied. “It is a
concern. On the other hand...

there probably is no state that c

you could look at and say, ‘We’d
trade the colleges and universi-
ties that you’ve got for the ones
we’ve got.”’

A 3 percent salary hike ha

tors, faculty, staff and students,
and is chaired by Provost James
Maher — and the University
Senate’s budget policies com-

But both committees ha
assumed’ that state lawmakers
would. cut Pitt’s appropriation
by 5 percent (as Gov. Mark
Schweiker had proposed) instead
of by “only” 3.7» percent, the hit
that Pitt ended up taking.

‘Both UPBC and SBPC had
recommended apportioning

$8 million will be cut
from selected budgets

0 help balance‘ its ﬁscal year 2003 budget, Pitt will
trim $8 million from the operating budgets of certain,
yet—to—be—determined responsibility centers.

Some targeted units may meet their budget—cutting goals by
not ﬁlling currently budgeted staff and faculty positions, said
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. “But this is not a budget that is
built around the expectation that there will be any significant
layoffs and position reductions,” he added.

‘Nordenberg, Provost James Maher and Senior Vice
Chancellor for Health Sciences Arthur Levine ultimately will
decide which units will absorb the'$8 million in budget cuts.
_According to Arthur Ramicone, vice chancellor for Budget and
Controller, the senior administrators will consider input from a
working group of responsibility center heads. _

Identifying the units to be cut “has_got to be done pretty

that any redefinition of the

Dunbar-Jacob.

Data indicate that the cur-
rent generation of U.S. college
students will change careers on‘
average four times, she said.
“Even if we can get enough
people entering nursing, we’re
losing them at various‘ points
along the way. So we need to
give them the opportunity to
‘change careers’ without getting
out of nursing entirely.”

Pites, undergi:adua1;e..nursiug 

program is intentionally broad-
based, she said, preparing “nurs-
ing generalists” who, through
work experience or through a
combination of more study and
work, will be able to develop
a specialty.

“Research tells us that while
the need for nurses to work in
hospitals will certainly continue
to grow, that rate of growth is
actually less than the projected
needs in home health care,
long-term care and ambulatory
care for our aging population,”
Dunbar-Jacob said.

Currently, 59 percent of
nurses work in hospitals nation-
wide; 18 percent are employed
in public or community settings;
9.5 percent in ambulatory care;
6.5 percent in nursing homes
and extended care, and the bal-
ance in assorted other jobs such
as nursing education, student
health, occupational health and
health planning agencies. . 

“VVhat this tells us in terms
of preparation for our nurses is
to have well—prepared nurses not
just for in-hospital care, but well

prepared for possible careers >

in these other growing nursing
care areas,” the nursing dean
said. “The implication for us
as educators, starting at the
undergraduate level, is to turn
out nursing generalists who will
have career ﬂexibility.”

Curriculum, scheduling ,
and recruiting implications .

Pitt’s nursing school has
expanded its curriculum recently,
partly as a response to the current
nursing shortage, Dunbar-Jacob
said. _ -

For example, Pitt is one of
the few nursing schools that

requires undergraduate courses
in informatics, leadership devel-
opment and community health.

Nursing undergrads at Pitt
learn how information is pro-
cessed within a health care
system, which opens specialty
options in a number of infor-
matics subﬁelds i and prepares
students to pursue a master’s in
informatics, the nursing “dean
said. ‘

ship lays the groundwork for
a master’s degree in nursing
administration and other nursing
care areas, she said, while the
course in community health
includes a component in home
care nursing, which is expected
to be among the fastest growing
areas of need.

‘ Moreover, the school is trying
to expand the ﬁeld of potential

nurses to include nontraditional .

students who want to enter nurs-
ing after being in the workforce
or raising a family.

“We’re [planning] to offer an
accelerated program, a second-
degree program, for individuals
who have already completed a

baccalaureate degree in another‘

area and are interestedin nurs-
ing, ” she said. “We want to make
our programs available regardless
of how long the person has been
out working. So we might take
someone into the informatics
grad program, for example, who
just ﬁnished an undergraduate
degree, or someone who wants
to re-tool from another career,
or someone who has been in
another area of nursing.”
Dunbar-Jacob said the target

pool is there, it just needs to

be tapped.

“We have a signiﬁcant
number of people expressing
interest in that kind of program.
Together with a favorable job
market, the more ﬂexibility we
have in terms of acceleration,
the more people we’re likely to
attract to come into nursing,”
she said. '

At the master’s level, the
school has waived the Graduate
Record Examination and the
V Miller Analogies Test as require-
ments for admission to several of

“Starting this fall, we’re also
accommodating the population
that’s likely to make career
changes by making adjustments
in our scheduling, so more
students {at Pitt] have the ﬂex-
ibility to develop minors or
double majors in nursing,”

Dunbar-Iacob acknowledged
that there were no plans in place
to increase the size of the faculty
or the undergraduate or master’s
programs, but said she is hopeful
that the school, in light of the
critical nursing shortage, will
expand in the not—too-distant
future. i

“As long as we maintain the
high quality of our graduates
and have the necessary faculty

,. in place, ,we;Wo11ld ...have..—_.no.,

objections to expanding our
programs,” Dunbar-Jacob said.
“[Pitt’s] central administration
clearly has priority areas for

 ‘growth within the University,
_ which are established years in
advance. But given the contribu- '
tion that our graduates make into.

the economy, and to the health
care industry in this region,
I would hope thatour school
would be relatively high up on
the priority list,” the dean said.
Dunbar-Iacob said that one
of her primary responsibilities as
dean is topursue more “entre-

preneurial opportunities” that

would increase the school’s

funding. “In today’s economic

’ situation, we have to lookbeyond

support from Pitt’s administra-

’ tion, for ‘more foundation sup-

port and other revenue streams

Pitt schooltackles

  SHO

to expand the undergraduate
student body and our programs,”
she said. - i l

~ One part ‘of the school that
is expected to grow in the near
future is the doctoral program,
Dunbar-Jacob said. Pitt currently
has about 35 doctoral students.
The program ranks ﬁfth among
schools of nursing nationally
in research funding from the
National Institutes of Health.

_ Increasing the number of doc-

_ toral candidates can impact the
nursing educator shortage, which
is both a regional and national
problem, Dunbar-Jacob said.
“One of the things we can

do without needing exorbitant '

amounts of money, is increase
enrollments in our doctoral pro-
gram to turn out more science-

.based educators. This would-

help ease the shortage in certain
--nursing specialties,” which is as

much due to a lack of teachers as

it is a lack of students.

A Some good news ‘

In the last year,‘ according

to Hospital & Healthsystem .
Association of Pennsylvania, A
admission-s to state nursing
schools rose from 3 ,5 O0 to 4,350
(up 24 percent) between 2000
and 2001, reversing aiﬁve-year

decline. . _
Pitt followed that trend,
according to Jacqueline Lever,

‘executive director of Student

Services at Pitt’s nursing school.
Undergraduate admissions were
up 19 percent between 2000 and
2001 ——- the school had to turn
away some 75 admits to keep to
its class limit of about 100 — and
applications were up 45 percent,
from 292 to 423, she said. “In

passing rate of our students
on their state boards,” Lever
said, which is higher than recent
national rates of 85-87 percent.
“About 75 percent of our under-

grads express an interest in pursu-

ing a higher nursing degree.”
There are several reasons for
the upward swingin applications,
Lever said, although the. number
of applicants nationally still lags
far behind the need. One reason

she said. In addition,“student
recruiting efforts are reaching
into the middle schools and
recruitment advertising has

increased dramatically. “Even
the exposure of nurses on popular
shows like ‘ER’ has improved
the image of the nurse,” Lever
maintained.

Ironically, a weak ob market
in other areas traditionally has
helped ease nursing shortages.

»Nursing is often the second

income in a household, and a
nurse typically will hold onto
a job when a spouse’s job is in
jeopardy. And part—time nurses
tend to increase their working
hours under such circumstances.
Unemployed and displaced
workers gravitate toward secure
jobs.

Producing higher-quality
and better-educated nurses can
have a ripple effect, Dunbar-

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

Jacob pointed out. “Nurses
have increasing responsibilities,
partly because technology has
increased the number of medi-
cal procedures requiring more
training and partly because many
more nurses — public health
personnel, nurse practitioners,
nurse clinicians in psychiatry
— are delivering direct care.
The better trained our nurses,
the more patients that can be
helped.”

This is especially true in
the hospital setting, she said.
“Hospitals are looking at ways
to restructure work to accom-
modate the vacancies and short-
age of nurses. But if we look at
outcomes of hospital care, the
one thing in general that seems

to predict patient outcomes is
the level of R.N. staffing at
the hospital. The real risk is
the alteration of the work envi-
ronment that doesn’t include
adequate numbers of R.N.s. If
we in education can rise to the
challenge of providing enough
R.N.s, we can really strengthen
the profession.” ,

Nationally, 41 percent of
employed nurses have at least
a baccalaureate degree, she
pointed out. “Many of us would
like to see that rate higher,”
she said.

from the Pitt School of
Nursing’s Class of 1999, herself

She laughed as she recalled a

i friend who was hired  Johns

Hopkins _ Hospital: “As V soon as

* ' the recruiters heard she was a
: Pitt grad, they asked her, ‘VVhen

can you»start?’”

‘ “I read a lot of nursing jour-

pages —— it seems like it increases
every month — listing job open-
ings across the United States,”
Roesch said. “A lot of hospitals,
I’ve noticed, are offering hiring
bonuses and . relocation
bonuses.” ' *0

Roesch is a staff nurse at the I

‘VA Medical Center in Oakland, I

’ and is pursuing a master’s degree

part—time in Pitt’s acute care

nurse practitioner program. “I’m

going for my master’s because

V I want to become an advanced

practice. nurse,” not because.
nurses need graduate degrees to

» get good jobs, she said.

Nor does a Ph.D. in nursing
open up more lucrative oppor-
tunities than a master’s degree,
noted doctoral student George
Rodway.

“In many cases, a nurse prac-
titioner with a master’s degree
—— which is what I am, currently

— will do better ﬁnancially" than '

a nursing Ph.D.,” Rodway said.
“Unless you have a special desire

‘to pursue research, as I do, "you"
can be better off ﬁnancially not
pursuing the Ph.D.” ~ ‘

(Pitt nursing DeanJacqueline

‘Dunbar-Jacob confirmed that

nurses enroll in her school’s
doctoral program because they
want to become scientists and
educators. “There are non-

ﬁnancial incentives that ‘are

attractive to those folks, including

helping to renew the [supply of] ‘

nurses and doing clinical research

that beneﬁts everybody,” the

dean said.)

Like many men who go into
nursing, Rodway had another
career ——- he was a high school
science teacher — before decid-

ing that nursing was what he I-

reallywanted to do. He earned
his B.S.N. from the University
of Akron in 1994 and his master’s
from Kent‘State four years later.
Rodway, 43, hopes to complete
his Ph.D. here in another year

and a half, and then get a post-"

doctoral fellowship. ,
“There’s no doubt that there

is going to continue to be a

shortage of Ph.D.s in nursing,”

Rodway said. “You don’t see the I
same peak—and—valley effect in

the supply of nursing Ph.D.s
that you see at the bachelor’s
degree level.” .

Rodway criticizes the nurs-
ing profession for failing to
recruit aggressively among men.
“There’s a serious shortage’ of
nurses, and the ﬁeld‘ is missing
out on half of the population as
potential recruits,” he ‘said.

A survey by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human
Services found that there were
146,902 male registered nurses in
2 000, representing 5 .4 percent of
the country’s nursing population.

0 That was up from 45 ,060 men

(2.7 percent of R.N.s) in 1980.

Currently, there are 30 men
among the 404 nursing under-
grads at Pitt.

Dan Martin, who this fall
will begin his senior year in the
Pitt nursing school’s bachelor
of science program, said he
considered several majors and
decided on nursing because he
will be virtually guaranteed a job
when he graduates.

“Especially now with the
nursing shortage, somebodywith
a bachelor’s degree in nursing
can get a job in any city in the
country, in almost any hospital,
basically doing whatever area

of practice you want,” Martin
said. . I
Martin initially planned to
enroll in law school or a gradu-
ate program in forensics, after
completing his B.S.N., but now
he’s leaning toward entering the
job market next spring. “Before
the spring term even ends, usu-
ally in January or February, the
nursing school hosts a job fair,”

hesaid. “Employers come from '

all over the area and from other
states as far away as Texas and
sometimes beyond. Representa-
tives from hospitals and health
care companies will meet with
students, conduct ‘interviews

right there and hire you on the 4

spot.” ‘

Martinworks in UPMC Pres-
byterian’s recovery room, and
said he’s seen evidence there of
the current nursing shortage.
“ . .

Sometimes, one nurse will be
taking care of as many as eight
patients,” he said. “Sometimes,
we’re having to keep patients

‘in the recovery room because

there are no staff to take them up
to the ﬂoor. There are just too
many patients” and not enough
nurses. It’s really affecting every
part of the hospital.”

Bethany Francis dreamed for
years of becoming a doctor. But
then, while attending a program

for Fayette County high school
“students considering careers
as health professionals, she
witnessed a baby being born at
Uniontown Hospital. J
“I saw that the nurse stayed
in the delivery room the entire
time, but the doctor was in and
out,” said Francis, who will begin
her sophomore year in Pitt’s
B.S.N. program next fall. “T-hat’s
WhenI thought, ‘Maybe I should
consider becoming ‘a nurse
instead.’ I like spending more
time with the patient — not that
doctors don’t spend time with
patients, please don’t get me
wrong. But I found that I liked
nursing better.”
~ While she hasn’t ruled. out
medical school eventually, Fran-
cis plans to attend graduate
school after earning her B.S.N.,
to become, a_ certiﬁed ‘nurse.-
widwife.
Francis was awarded one of
the Pitt nursing school’s two

inaugural Adena Davis Scholar- ,

ships for outstanding minority
students (27 of the 404 current
nursing undergrads are minori-.
ties). She said she’s found the
school to be “verywelcoming” to
minorities. “But I’ve found that

the school is welcoming overall, 1

to all students,” she added-.

study of
concussions in
young athletes
Researchers at Pitt’s School of
Medicine and Carnegie Mellon
University will objectively study,
for the first time, the effects of
single and multiple concussions
on the ‘brains of high school
and college athletes. The study,
funded by a $3 million grant

from the National Institutes
of Health, will use functional
magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to help determine when
athletes can safely return to play
following a concussion. ’

Concussion occurs when the
brain is rocked violently inside
the skull due to a blow to the head

1 or upper body. Approximately 10
1 percent of all athletes in contact

sports suffer a concussion each
season. _
Pitt’s Department of N euro-

logical Surgery, in collabora-

tion with the sports medicine
program of the Department
of Orthopaedic Surgery, the

Department of Psychiatry and
CMU, will study 250 student
athletes over the next ﬁve years.

“To our knowledge there
have been no studies examining
the effects of concussion on high

’ school athletes. Yet, the majority ‘

of the 17 athletes who died
following a second -concussion
between 1992 and 1997 were
high school students,” said

Donald Marion, professor of

neurological surgery at the
University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine and principal inves-
tigator of -the study.

“There is evidence that ath-
letes who suffer a second concus-
sion before they have fully
recovered from the ﬁrst are

vulnerable to acute severe brain
swelling or death,” said Mark
Lovell, a neuropsychologist and
assistant professor of orthopaedic
surgery, director of the UPMC

Sports Medicine Concussion’

Program and co—investigator of

‘ the study.

“The results of this study are
expected to provide a physiologic
and anatomic underpinning for
the cognitive "deﬁcits observed
after one or more concussions in

at—risk groups. This information »

should enable the development
of far better and far more objec-
tive guidelines for who can safely

PEOPLE OF ‘THE TIIVIES

Rhett Kennedy has been
promoted to associate dean of
student affairs at the Bradford

J campus.

Kennedy, who had been serv-
ing as assistant dean of student
affairs, also has been the director
of residential life and housing
and will continue to serve in
that capacity.

Besides handling all aspects
of the student code of conduct
and the judicial system, Kennedy
has been the chief administrator
in overseeing the various moves
taking place this summer due
to the expansion/‘renovation

. project of the Frame-Westerberg

Commons. Kennedy also has
been developing and managing
numerous alternatives to maxi-
mize student-housing enroll-
ment, which has been increasing
at Pitt-Bradford.

. Before he started working
at Pitt—Bradford in 1996, Ken-
nedy was the residential life and
judicial coordinator 1 for West
Virginia Wesleyan College.

Kennedy is a 1992 graduate
of Pitt-Bradford, earning~a
bachelor’s degree ' in broadcast
communications. He also holds a
master’s'degree in student affairs

in higher education from Indiana.

University of Pennsylvania.

Robert Glaser, founding
director emeritus of Pitt’s Learn-
ing Research and Development

Center (LRDC) and Distin-
guished Professor of Psychology
and Education, has received the
2002 honorary Doctor of Laws
degree from McGill University
in Montreal.

McGill’s honorary degrees
recognize those individuals
“whose accomplishments are of

' such excellence that they provide

inspiration and leadership to its
[McGill’s] graduates.”

Glaser joined Pitt’s. Depart-
ment of Psychology in 1956 and
founded LRDC in 1963, serving
as its director until 1997.

His work currently focuses on
cognitive processes in instruc-
tion, the nature of expertise,
the assessment of subject-matter
competence and the relationships
between cognitive science and
educational measurement. 2

Glaser delivered the McGill
Faculty of Education convoca-
tion address, titled “The Road to
Competence.” His main goal, he
said, was “to provide informa-
tion that would help graduates
become more aware of their
own progress as they become
increasingly more competent in
their work.”

Two Titusville faculty mem-
bers recently traveled to north-
western Tanzania to develop

Social work to offer master’s at UPB

Beginning this fall, Pitt’s
School of Social Work (SSW)

will offer a'rnaster'ofsocial‘worket

program at‘ the Bradford campus
via interactive television.

The program will be tailored
to working professionals inter-
ested in advanced direct practice
with a focus in the areas of

' children, youth and families.

“This is a great opportunity
for students to earn a masters
degree in social workin Bradford
without their having to travel to
Pittsburgh,” said Deborah Dick

Pontzer, director of outreach,

services at Pitt—Bradford.

. “The whole region will ben-
eﬁt from the increased number
of credentialed social workers,”
Pontzer added, “and the quality
of care and thelevel of services
available at the social service

‘ and‘ child welfare ofﬁces will be

enhanced.” V 

~Another advantage of the

program, Pontzer said, is that it
will‘iprovi‘dep1‘ofessional devel--' 6' ‘ ‘ ‘i

opment for child welfare work-
ers through Children Welfare
Educationfor Leadership, which
is coordinated statewide by Pitt’s
social work school.

The M.S.VV. program is a.
result of planning efforts of the

' School of Social Work, the Ofﬁce

of Adult Continuing Education
and Outreach Services at Pitt-
Bradford, as well as_Pitt’s central
and Bradford campus administra-
tions. The Center for Instruc-

tional Development‘ and. Dis- ’

tance Education, has provided
support for the technologies
needed to deliver the program.

Health service certiﬁcate programs to begin S

The College of General Stud-

ies (CGS) will offer two health

services certiﬁcate programs

this fall designed to help health

, professionals improve their skills

_and advance in their ﬁelds.
Each of the programs —

Managing Health Services Pro-

grams and Projects, and Com-

7 munity Health Assessment —

comprises six courses for 18
credits. The two curricula were

2 developed by university faculty,
-with consultation from advisers

within the community and
the health industry, and were
designed to allow students to
improve their communication
and management skills and their
knowledge of the health ﬁeld.

Credits earned through the

programs also can be applied to
a B.A. in health services.
“This is a new market for

the College of General Studies,”

says CGS Dean Susan R. Kinsey.
“Research shows that employers
are increasingly inclined to invest
in short-term education and will

use their continuing education-

dollars" to send employees to
programs such as these.” V
The Managing Health Ser-
vices Programs and Projects
Certiﬁcate ‘emphasizes grant
and research project manage-
ment; the Community Health
Assessment Certiﬁcate will aid
professionals in social services
and ‘public and community

. health.

“We concentrate on the edu-
cation and skills that our region’s
health industry employers are
looking for,” says Laura Hast-
ings, associate dean for academic
affairs in CGS.
