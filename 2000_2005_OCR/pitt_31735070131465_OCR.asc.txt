Nationality Rooms

LAM HUFFMAN
Staff Writer

Groups representing nations from around the world
all joined in the Cathedral of Learning last weekend.
The Nationality Rooms Program held a free holi-

day open house last Sunday. Families with children

visited alongside senior citizens. .
Booths on the first ﬂoor displayed ethnic foods an

demonstrations. Each table represented a’ different‘

Nationality Room. One booth even, sold the
“Nationality Rooms Recipe Book.” At another booth
nearby, visitors had their name written in Gaelic and
translated for them. Handmade crafts from Bolivia
were available to buy, as were Slovak Christmas orna-
merits.

Visitors toured the Cathedral’s 25 Nationality
Rooms on the first and third floors. Each room is dec-
orated to represent its country’s traditional holiday
style. Inside the rooms, tour guides wore native "dress
and explained the holiday customs of the nation they
represented. . ' ‘ I

The African Heritage room even offered a
Kwanzaa crossword puzzle and a “Seven principles of
Kwanzaa” information sheet.

“The holiday open house is a nice way to serve
your community,” said senior Krista Traini, who spoke
in the English classroom. “These rooms are very,
unique and special to Pittsburgh. This is our way of
giving back.”

Traini is the president of Quo Vadis, the volunteer
student organization that supplies tour guides for the
Cathedral’s Nationality Rooms. The group’s name
means “Where are you going?”

In the center of the first floor commons room, per-
formances took place every .15 minutes.

The Society of Creative Anachronisms held two
performances early in the day. The group is made up of
citizens from all over the Pittsburgh area, and members

Students line up at lunchtime in front of Hillman Library to buy a meal from vendors.

“I don’t know what I’m going to do when we
have to get out of here,” said Trang Ly, the owner
of the Eggroll Vending truck parked in front of the
Hillman Library. “This food truck is my life.”

With a look of worry on her face, Ly glances
over her shoulder to the line of hungry students,
staff and faculty from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University that forms at her truck during
lunchtime, anxiously waiting in the cold for a hot
plate of Chinese food. “At least the students are
happy we are here,” Ly said.

they drafted for the ordinance,” said Craig

* Kwiecinski, the mayor’s spokesman. “We ques-

tioned whether it’s legal to regulate who can and
cannot park in a public spot.”

But even the veto from the mayor could not
hinder this legislation fromlbecoming law.

The nine members of city council reconvened
and unanimously overrode the mayor’s decision.
On Jan. 1, the new ordinance will take effect and
will be enforced for two years. .

This decision leaves both the Oakland com-
munity and the vendors all wondering if they will
be able to buy or sell hot food and Pitt clothing, as
they have become accustomed to for the last

decade.

With a steaming plate of
food in his hands, Greg
Fisher, who works _as a
researcher for Pitt, prepares
his lunch by grabbing a few
packets of soy sauce.

“I eat here often because
it’s really convenient,” Fisher

ing and vendors is several
years old. City council and

said.

On Jan. 1, 2001, the service that vendor
trucks provide will no longer be available in
Oakland. Because of Ordinance 26, the present
vending conditions in front of the Hillman
Library, as well as across the entire city of
Pittsburgh, will be prohibited and new laws will
be instated and enforced. , p .

Number one on the city’s list for improving
the vending situation: prohibit vending from
metered parking spots. A

It was because of this amendment to the ordi-
nance, which was penned by councilman Dan
Cohen representing the Oakland District, that

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy vetoed the legis—-

lation.
“We felt council was overreaching in what

the Oakland Business
Improvement District in particular, feel the ven-
dors exacerbate Oakland’s parking woes.

According to the old ordinance, vending from
a metered parking spot was not prohibited, but
vendors were required to move their vehicles
when the allotted time was up, which depends on
the parking meter. ,

For instance, the meters in front of Hillman
are two—hour spots, which require vendors to
move their vehicles when the two hours are up.

‘Instead of moving their vehicles, vendors
feed the meter all day long, causing them to
receive tickets and to keep valuable parking spots
all day.

Stop and smell the
poinsettias at Phipps

PAVAN A BHAT
Staff Writer

A short walk from campus yields an
amazing holiday gift — a gift given to
the City of Pittsburgh by Henry Phipps
in 1893 —- Phipps Conservatory. '

This holiday season the conservato-
ry will bring Christmas joy once again
with its annual winter ﬂower show: Gifts
Under Glass. 3*:

With the madness of ﬁnals begin-
ning, Phipps is a sanctuary for the weary
soul. In the maze of rooms, one can get
lost in the crowds of red and white poin-
settias, kalanchoes, Chrysanthemums
and azaleas that line the historic build-
mg.

A wonderful showcase of trains is
centered in a room of the conservatory,
and the 13 differently themed rooms are
filled with ﬂowers.

The Serpentine Room has the scent

‘ of fir trees set against garlands with sl1in—

ing white lights. The East Room holds a
white winter wonderland with an icy
pond and mounds of snow. Nestled in
the comer, Santa’s sleigh waits with gifts
and plants. For some, a residence hall
bedroom without a tree just doesn’t feel
like Christmas. The Victoria room. will
suffice for those students, with its huge

tree covered in tropical ﬂowers and gift
boxes.

“I come here every year at
Christmas‘ with my roommates because
it puts me in the holiday spirit,” said
junior Allison Glenn.»

Sophomore John Zimmerman said,

“My girlfriend loves this place, and so I,

brought her here to spend some time
together and relax before ﬁnals. The
room with the trains is my favorite.”

“I went to the show with the butter-

ﬂies with one of my friends and thought u

that I would check this one out too. They
managed to make this look completely
different than the last time I came here,”
said freshman Jenna Washinko.

The Victorian glasshouse holds not
only winter ﬂora, but many activities
and entertainment. Every weekend
through Dec. 24, Santa will be in the
gallery for photos and cookies/.“From
Dec. 12 to 30, Phipps will be open until
9 p.m. and will have “Candlelight
Evenings,” which serve as a whole new
way to see the rooms, featuring live
music. In addition, gospel entertainers
perform each Saturday morning while
classical music is showcased every
Sunday afternoon.

A great place to relax during the
busy weeks ahead, the best gift of all is
that Phipps is free with a valid Pitt ID.

What we’d like to give and
receive this holiday season

Today is St. Nicholas Day.

For those who are unfamiliar
with the Dutch tradition, celebrating
this holiday involves removing your
shoe and being surprised and delight-
ed when “St. Nick” ﬁlls it with candy.
It seems that this day marks the onset
of the holiday gift-exchanging sea-
son, and certainly there is something
magically wonderful about both giv-
ing and receiving. We at The Pitt
News have developed wish lists, of
both the things we’d like to give and
the things we’d like to get.

To the University, we wish to
donate an important gift — tarp.
Fresh, unripped, super-strength tarp,
perhaps something in a bright color
or bold print. The Quad needs it des-
perately.

To the hundreds of South
Oakland residents shivering in their
drafty apartments, we wish to give
ultra-powerful space heaters. 1

To Al Gore, we bestow a hefty
box of Kleenex.

To Posvar Hall, we dream of giv— '

ing a “new” name. Forbes
Quadrangle comes to mind, If we

. can’t afford the full name, We’d be

happy to purchase just the

. “Quadrangle” part. The sound of

“Posvar Hall Quadrangle” carries a
melodious jingle.  fact, we’d like to
buy the title “Quadrangle” for all the

buildings the Cathedral
Quadrangle of Learning, William
Quadrangle Pitt Union and so on.

To the Student Government
Board, we’d like to give an empty
cardboard box. This will amuse them
endlessly, consideringtheir childish
behavior in the past.

As for -receiving, we’re hoping
for a parking genie — a magic being
that you can summon whenever you

want a parking space to appear.

We’d also like the panther statue
that SGB bought last year to appear
in all of its $70,000 glory. The statue
is being made in Italy, so we’d enjoy
it even more if some Italian delicacies
such as angel hair pasta, cannoli and
ﬁne wines would be included as com-
pensation for the long wait. ‘

We desire banishment from the
streets of Oakland of all those annoy-
ing metal scooters that are currently
the teeny-bopper rage.

We want more real puppies, as
opposed to the weird robotic ones
that are popular now with the kiddies.
In an ideal world, the puppies would
never grow up and lose their cuteness
and never have to relieve themselves.

We wish for free, instant trans-
portation to the bowl game in
Phoenix. We wish for free student
tickets. Perhaps most importantly, we
wish for a victory.

Rights or area Buddhists

_ Does the government have the right to
restrict your religious activities to one day a
week? The Rev. Kyoki Roberts

her.

_ Roberts is an ordained Soto
Zen Buddhist clergywoman and
currently serves as resident priest of .
the Zen Center of ' Pittsburgh
(http://w'ww.prairiewindzen.org/zcp). The center
is located in Bell Acres, a rural Allegheny County
borough. Because the center is in a residential
area, Roberts had to apply for a conditional per-
rnit to operate it

But receiving this permit from the borough
was not enough to guarantee the religious rights
of Roberts and other area Buddhists. In the Nov.
28 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Marylynne Pitz
reported that the borough had sent Roberts a let-

ter informing her that the local government would I

only permit her to conduct meditations and ser-

vices on Sundays. ‘
Such a condition is unacceptable to Roberts

and the Buddhist community, which holds class-

es, retreats, and other spiritual activities at the cen- A

ter on every day of the week except Monday.
Naturally, the Pittsburgh chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, ‘under the leadership of
executive director VVIto1d Walczak, has moved to
oppose the actions of the Bell Acres borough
council. An outraged Walczak was quoted by the
Post-Gazette as declaring, “You can’t pray or

meditate Monday through Saturday? Wait a-

minute! Since when in this country can the gov-
ernment tell people on which days they can pray

I and meditate?”

I share Walczak’s outrage. As long as the Zen
Center’s patrons are not creating a traﬂic hazard
or otherwise interfering in the lives of their neigh-
bors, I see no justiﬁcation for limiting the center’s
operation to just one day a week

Furthermore, if the Bell Acres council’s
imprudent actions were to be upheld by the

courts, to what could this precedent lead? Jewish .

ought to be respected

synagogues in residential areas being forced to
hold Sabbath services on Sunday? Mid-week
‘ Bible s111dies by Baptists being halt-
ed? Daily masses by Roman
Catholic priests being banned by
local authorities?

Reading Pitz’s report caused
me to wonder. Is the Bell Acres
council sincerely trying to enforce local zoning
laws, or is this case merely an example of anti-
Buddhist prejudice in action? I don’t know the
answer to that question. B11t if it is a case of reli-
gious bigotry, those individuals who are trying to
use local government as a tool for religious per-
secution should be ashamed of themselves. V

After‘ reading Pitz’s report, I made a tele-
phone call to the Zen’ Center to express my sup-
port for its cause. Roberts was kind enough to
share with me some of her own droughts regard-
ing the situation.

Although Roberts’ struggle is -taking place in
a locale that is somewhat removed ﬁom our own
campus, I believe that her situation is one in
which college students should take an active
interest Roberts agreed with me. She said, “I
 that when people go to the University, they
are moving out of a_more limited viewpoint and

. seeking a broader perspective.”

She added that as members of a university
community, we have to “make sure we accept

I have no doubt that Roberts, with the help of ‘

the local ACLU, will prevail in her quest to have
her religious freedom respected by local govern-
ment. And I further believe that her anticipated

The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestling team hit the

bright lights of Las Vegas this weekend
to compete in the Las Vegas Invitational
tournament.
Competing against a ﬁeld that included
11 top 20 teams in the InterMat poll, the
No. 20 Panthers scored 63 points to
lock up a 12th—place ﬁnish. V

Head coach Rande Stottlemyer
seemed optimistic about his team’s per-
formance but stressed continued
improvement.’ _

“We improved tremendously,”
Stottlemyer said. “I think we have come
a long way. Are we where we want to
be? No.”

“We made quite a few mental errors
that cost us. But those aremistakes that
are easily corrected, and we will cer-
tainly get better,” he said.

A trio of Panthers reached the quar-
terfinals in their respective weight
classes. Rob Loper and Zach Doll, each
coming off titles at the Mat Town
Invitational, stepped it up once again
this week to reach the quarters in the
133- and 157—pound weight classes,
respectively.

Carl Fronhoffer reached the quar-
terﬁnals as well in the 165 weight class,
before losing to Matt Lackey of Hlinois
in a hard-fought 2-1 tiebreaker.
Fronhoffer won a 9-4 victory over

Wrestle    rit in Las eg

David Sandberg made the second round of the Las Vegas Invitational.

Eddie Gifford of Fresno State and took
a seventh place finish in the consolation
match.

“Carl did a very good job; he has
improved tremendously,” Stottlemyer
said. “He still has some mental things to
work on, but he is very strong.”

r Unfortunately, the Panthers’ suc-
cess at the tournament did not go with-
out injury. Loper dominated in the early

rounds of the tournament, Winning 9-1
major decisions over Columbia’s
Steven Popovitch and South Dakota
State’s Kris Dozark.

' After defeating Jason Fratzke of
Montana State and losing a close quar-
terfinal match to Derrick Loper of
Fresno State, Loper was forced to for-
feit his consolation match to Foley
Dowd of Michigan because of a knee

injury.

Doll also suffered an ankle injury
after defeating Shawn Harmon of
Stanford and pinning Lehigh All-
American Ryan Bernholtz and
Colorado Mines’ Jon Martinez.

Many of Pitt’s wrestlers advanced
to the second round in their weight
classes, including Shawn Amistade
(125), Justin Giovinco (141), Brendan
O’Connell (174) and David Sandberg
(197). 5

“Brendan is the warrior of our
guys,” Stottlemyer said. “He loves to
just go all out.”

“David wrestled real well, too. He
has improved tremendously, but he still
needs to work on his consistency,”
Stottlemyer added.

Stottlemyer also stressed the impor-
tance of the major decisions and pins
that Pitt racked up.

“We earned quite a few extra
points. If you can do that, it’s like you
have an extra guy out there,” he said.

The wrestling team returns home
this weekend to fight a dual match on
Friday at Fitzgerald Field House
against a tough Bloomsburg squad.
Stottlemyer is looking forward to the
challenge.

“It’s a league match, and I always
tell the guys that it’s like a double win
or double loss for us,” Stottlemyer said.
“They have basically the -same team
that beat us last year, so we’re going to
have to step it up a notch.” '

Not all Pitt students heading to Phoenix for bowl game

Obviously, it’s wonderful that the
Pitt football team will be playing in
this year’s Insight.com Bowl. Walt
Harris has done a phenomenal job
getting the team back into a bowl for
the first time since the Panthers’ loss
in the 1997 Liberty Bowl. The players
are pumped up, and, of course, so are
Pitt fans.

The team’s success this season
serves as a unifying factor around
campus. The buzz in the halls of the
Cathedral the last few days has been
focused on the game. Students who
don’t even follow football have taken
an interest.

The entire situation is perfect,

except for one small detail: I won’t be ~

there.

Unfortunately, trips such as one to
the Insight.com Bowl require money,
something which I, along with many

other college students, am a little
short on.

And so, I’m left to pout and curse
the fact that ‘Howell, N.J., is so far
from Phoenix.

Maybe I just care too much about
sports, something I’m frequently
accused of, but I’m not quite sure
that’s possible. Whatever the reason,
I’ve been moping around for days

' complaining about how unfair it is

that I won’t be going to the BOB. I
guess it’s simply the fact that I love
Pitt football. And now the team is
preparing for its most glorious
moment in years, and it hurts know-
ing I won’t be a part of it.

I can’t even begin to express the
pride I feel for Pitt. I’ve been talking
nonstop to family and friends about
the success of the football team and
how awesome it is for us to be playing

in abowl. But more importantly, the
game in Phoenix willjdo wonders for
the development of the pro-
gram.

While I’m happy for the
team and any students who do
get to go, I’m bitter because I’ve
been to a bowl game before and
know that it’s an incredible
experience. I went to the Citrus
Bowl twice, on New Year’s Day
1998 and 1999, not as a fan
of either team’ but as a per-
former in the halftime show.
Those are two days that I

will remember for the rest of Karen Bielak

my life, and I can only imagine
that the Insight.com Bowl will be a
million times better just because it’s
my school that’s playing.

‘But complaining doesn’t get a
person anywhere, so I just want to say

  
  
    
   

to Walt Harris, the entire coaching 

staff and the players, good luck. There
are thousands of Pitt
football fans who are
unable to make the trip
but want you to know
that they support you and
will be cheering V you on
from afar. You will be in
our hearts as we hope we
will be in yours. Knock
‘em dead, and show the
A world just how special
.  Panther football is. And
‘ remember,_ we’re all
behind you. Let’s go
Pitt!

Karen Bielak is a columnist for The
Pitt News, and while she won’t be
going to Phoenix, she will be attend-
ing this year’s Garden State Bowl.

Selwyn thriving in first season as starter

BRAD CUPRIK

Assistant Sports Editor

When you live across the street from a
park as a youngster, it’s easy to get into
sports and learn new games everyday.

Pitt sophomore point guard Laine Selwyn
is still learning, on and off the basketball
court, as she has begun her first season as a
starter.

Selwyn, from Coral Springs, Fla_., learned
under fifth—year senior Gina Montesano last
season.

Although Selwyn knew the game of bas-
ketball well, Montesano gave her valuable
lessons on what head coach Traci Waites
expected and what to expect from college
life.

“She definitely made the transition easier
for me, because there was someone I could
follow,” Selwyn said. “If she was in practice
before I was, I could watch what she was
doing.” '

Selwyn still discusses basketball and life
with Montesano through e-mail, as she is in
California now. ‘

“We definitely bonded,” Selwyn said.

She also has her boyfriend‘ and starting

small forward for the men’s basketball team, _

Ricardo Greer, to call on for help and to give
advice to him as well.
“We ‘come up to the gym sometimes,

shoot around or play one-on—one,” Selwyn
said. “I like it, he’s fun to be around.”

Since she was a little girl growing up in
Brooklyn, N.Y., Selwyn has participated in
sports, but said playing organized basketball
was an afterthought until she joined a church
league at St. Mark’s.

“Being ‘Jewish, it was kind of ironic that I
got started at St. Mark’s, but ever since then,
basketball has been No. 1 with me,” Selwyn
said.

She and her family moved to Florida and
she became involved with Amateur Athletic
Union basketball and played for her middle
school team before her stellar career at Coral

«Springs.

Selwyn ‘averaged 21.5 points, 7.8
rebounds, 6.3 assists and 4.1 steals in her
high school career, finishing with 2,251,
career points. 0 T

The awards poured in as she finished her
sophomore campaign and continued until she
graduated in the spring of 1999. , "

Selwyn was named the Miami Herald and
Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel Girls

Basketball Player of the Year in her senior

year.
She was also a two-time USA Today All-

USA Basketball honorable mention.

A With all-district and all-state awards as
well,” Selwyn attracted attention from several

“I made non-official visits to

FROM PAGE 10

‘West Virginia, South Florida and

Boston University, but I like the big
city thing and the chance to play in
the Big East Conference,” Selwyn
said.

In her freshman year at Pitt,
Selwyn played in all 29 games,
starting in 11 of them in the middle
of the season.

“It’s tough, because you come
from being -a star in high school,
getting a lot of publicity and start-
ing all oVer,” Selwyn said. “I
expected it to happen, though.”

Her best game was toward the
end of the season on Feb. 26 at
Fitzgerald Field House against
Georgetown.

She hit on seven of 10 attempts
from the field, including three of
four behind the three-point line and
acareer-fhigh 21 points.

I “I.:-.g?ot more comfortable at the .
end, "’be'cause:§ coach Waites was
pu/ttintg me at,’-'$tl'1,e_end of the game,” j"
Selwynsaid. 5:_5That- told me that she 
wanted ,-me in there when things .

were ‘important, whether we were
winningjor losing.”

For the season, Selwyn aver-
aged 6.3 -points per game and was
the team’s top free throw shooter in

Big East games.

“Laine gained valuable experi-
ence as a point guard last year,”
Waites said. “She has matured over
the summer and is ready to lead our
team at the point.”

The maturation process over the
summer consisted of more basket-
ball for Selwyn, as she was chosen
to compete for the Big East travel-
ing team’ in Canada. '

“It was so much fun,” Selwyn

said. “We should have been unde-'

feated, but we lost the first game on
the first night we got up there.”

One player on each of the teams
in the Big East played exhibition
games, and Selwyn said she learned
how other players dealt with their
respective coaches and a little about
her competition for the upcoming
season.

“You have UConn at the top, but
on any night, the other teams can all
beat each other,” Selwyn said.

So far this year, Selwyn has fit
well into her new role as starting
point guard, scoring 19 points and
dishing out six assists in Pitt’s 88-
79 win over Ohio on Saturday.

“I’m able to communicate well
with the other players because I’m
more confident on the court,”
Selwyn said. “I feel I’m a better
player this year in every aspect of
the game.”

Her teammates see the improve-
ment as well.

“She’s learned a lot under coach
Waites, and we feel comfortable
with her bringing the ball up the
court,” said senior shooting guard
Monique Toney.

Selwyn’s leadership role has got
her acting more like a senior and
not as a sophomore.

“I need to be out there, every-

day inpractice, busting my butt,

and I want to play with people who
are doing that too,” Selwyn said.

She has had talented players and
coaches to guide her along the way,
but Selwyn is ready to put it all
together.

“I’m ready,” Selwyn said. “You
can say you are, say you’re ready,
but are you? You have to show it.”
