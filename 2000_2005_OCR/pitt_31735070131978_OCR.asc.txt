Sitting in cages, students protest testing

“There’s no stimulation in
here,” said Daniel Moyer, sitting
cross-legged inside a. cramped
chicken-wire enclosure. “It makes
you want to hit the cage.”

Moyer, along with other mem-
bers . of Voices for Animal
Liberation, was demonstrating
against animal testing on Pitt’s
campus, in observation of National
Primate Liberation Week. Sitting
outside the William Pitt Union, the
group displayed literature advocat-
ing animal rights and pictures of
monkeys in restraining devices,
while collecting signatures for vari-
ous petitions and conversing with
skeptical and sympathetic passers—
by.

Candice Zawoiski, a graduate
student, said the makeshift cage
confining Moyer was a rough esti-
mation of the sorts of enclosures
used to house primates on Pitt’s
campus, conditions which cramp
the animals’ bodies as well as their
emotionally and psychologically
complex nature.

“We wouldn’t do this to human
babies, and many primates have the
emotional and psychological capac-
ity of a five—year-old child,” she

 

said. “Animals are sentient beings
who feel pain, especially primates.”

Zawoiski added that she hadn’t
seen Pitt’s labs, but that is only
because the research departments

.do not take kindly to visitors.

“Pitt’s animal research is secre-
tive,” she said, “but we know from
USDA reports that there are shady
things going on.”

The reports, which document
inspections‘ conducted between
Sept. 3‘, 2002 and March '12 2003,
cite numerous violations of the fed-
eral Animal Welfare Act at Pitt’s
research facilities, including the
presence of outdated drugs, inap-
propriate procedures involving the
animals and unsanitary conditions
in labs. The report also indicates
that some of the Violations, as of
March 13, remained uncorrected.

Despite infringements, animal
testing at.Pitt — and at other uni-
versities and research centers —
continues to receive funding.
Earlier this year, the _ National
Institutes of Health granted almost

Development Center to aid its con-

Some students head straight for
the local bar after finishing a major
exam. The words “I’m getting wasted
tonight,” are an experience that. some
college students would not deny them-
selves. But could this ritual lead to a
possible addiction problem?

It is .a definite possibility, accord-
ing to Dennis C. Daley, associate pro-
fessor of psychiatry at Pitt’s Schooltof
Medicine.

People who are addicted to a sub-
stance usually have a condition
response — an automatic reaction -

and they tend to use the substance as a -~

coping mechanism or a means of relief
from a stressful situation. _
‘ Daley, one of the two speakers at

this year’s Pitt Mini Med School lec—"

ture, titled Understanding Addiction,
presented several studies on alcohol
addiction. His research shows that sub-
stance abuse becomes, not only a prob-
lem for the addicts and their families,
but also a problem for society.
According to the World Health
Organization, seven out of 10 causes

A of disability in the world are related

directly to substance abuse or mental
disorders.- ,

An estimated total cost of alcohol
and drug abuse in the United States for
1992 was $245.7 billion, according to
a study by The Lewin Group for the

‘A National Institute on Drug Abuse and

the National Institute on Alcohol

So .what is the best way to cut
down economic costs in this area?

“Get the person treated,” said
Daley, who pointed out treatment
methods including expressing concern
for the addict, confronting the prob-
lem, seeking professional help and
attending Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings.

Many people also suffer from
nicotine addiction.

According to Kenneth A. Perkins, ~

a psychiatry professor in Pitt’s School
of Medicine, nicotine has been shown
to have the highest risk of dependence
among users. The more often a person
smokes, the more likely aiperson is to
become addicted. Perkins, who spoke
Tuesday night, found that cutting
down on cigarettes does not eliminate
healthrisks that are caused by smok-
ing, such as lung disease.

_ . .. .:Per«.kins- showed iif findings

that," although becoming addicted to
nicotine takes time, more young peo-
ple are addicts. People who start smok-
ing when 14 or 15 years of age become
hooked on cigarettes by the time they
are‘2l years old. Perkins emphasized
that it is important to educate young
people about the benefits of quitting
and to. become active in their attempt
to overcome the addiction.

During the lecture, Daley asked
the audience, “How many of you don’t
know anyone with an addiction prob-

_lem?” out of a full auditorium, only

one hand was raised.

The Housing Resource Center

While the Center can advise
students about certain landlords’
reputations, it still lists’ properties
from any source, regardless of the

owner’s repute, as long as the house‘

the city. 1

“Having a property that passes

ful information at the Housing
Resource Center’s Web site,
www.pitt.edu/5-property.

Hopkins also advises students
to use common sense when dealing

with landlords and to be smart with

their money. Never hand over
money naively and always ask for a
receipt, he said. ‘

“The moral here is: really look
at what you’re getting into,”
Breitlauch said in retrospect. “And
don’t giye anyone money for a shit-

characteristic of the industry.

“[Animal testing] is a billion-

that capital often overrides ethics.

“Students should know their
tuition dollars are going towards
this research,” she said.

The group said the demonstra-

tion had received a positive
response from members of the com-
munity, who stopped by to inquire
about the caged humans. They suc-
cessfully collected signatures for
their petition to raise funds for a
primate sanctuary after testing, all
the while alternating cage duty and
offering brownies and pins to those
interested.

There was no set time limit on
how long each member stayed in
the cage, and Moyer planned to stay
in until he had to go to class.

Hussein, Rwanda killings upset Wiesel, but he continues to maintainhope

Wiesel, page 3

Although he condemned the anti-
Sernitism that he said has grown more
prominent in some parts of the Islamic
world today, VV1esel commended the reli-
gious relationships that have improved.

“I must be honest and tell you that, at
least in the ﬁeld of religious interrelations, a
lot of progress has been made,” he said,
adding that J ewish-Christian relations have
never been better. He praised-popes John
XXIII and John Paul II for advancing their
relationship with the Jewish community
and addressing difﬁcult subjects like the.
Holocaust. ‘

“In my life, in my little town, when I
saw a priest, I confess I felt fear,” Wiesel
said of his childhood.

’ He would even cross the street to avoid
passing near a church, he said.

“And today, some of my best ﬁiends .

are cardinals,” he added, provoking laughs.’

His only criticism of the discussions
that have occurred between Jews and
Christians was the exclusion of a third reli-
gron.

‘They should have opened the discus-
sion to Islan1,” VV1esel said, explaining that
he believed the relationship between Jews

‘ and Muslims would be very different today
if they had begun talking in -the 19603,
when Jews and Christians began the most
recent progress in their relationship.

To illustrate the commonalities
between the Jewish and Christian faiths,
Wiesel pointed out that both religions share
an “obsession with the Messiah.”

“We all believe in the Messiah, except
you believe that he came and will come
back, and we believe he still has yet to
come,” he said, relating a joke in which a
rabbi addresses’, a priest. 1

“So why don’t we wait together and,

when he gets here, ask him, ‘Have you -

been here before?”’ he said, completing the
joke with»-a solemn voice. i ’ r’

V But while VV1esel expressed a great"

deal of hope and. faith in his religion, his
spent more time addressing suffering. '

“I believe in memory as a shield -—
that if we remember, we shall be shielded
from similar atrocities,” he said, explaining
his dedication to keeping memories of the
Holocaust alive, as well as reliving the suf-
fering of all people through their own
memories. j I

But remembering, he admitted, is very
difficult" and painful. ,

“Should ‘we forget?” he asked. “We

couldn’t live if we didn’t forget how mortal ,

—we are.,What does one do with memories
of suffering?” I

VV1esel said many people who survived

the Holocaust have split between two

views. The first view,’ he said, focuses on

the suﬁering of Jewish people. Jews of this

persuasion “forget everyone else” and con— __
' centrate on helping other Jews. A .

According to the second view, he
explained, people take the suffering they
incurred, ignore their own people, and try to

 

 

share their lessons with those who did not
go through the same degree of suffering.

VV1ese1 said he takes a third perspec-
tive, assisting Jews as his primary directive,
but not shutting out others in the process.

“My priorities are Jewish priorities;
however, they are not exclusive,” he said.
“Whenever people suffer, they could be at
the center of my world, but it should not be
at the expense of my people.”

VV1esel said he felt great failure at the
mass murders committed in Rwanda in the
1990s — killings that were known in the
United States and the United Nations.

“We have suffered not only at the
hands of killers, but we also suffered and
died because of the indiﬁerence of the

/

 

bystanders and the onlookers of the world,”
he said. On this same reasoning, Wiesel
explained the reasons for intervening in
Iraq and stopping Saddam Hussein, who he
referred to as a “'massmurderer.” _

“He had weapons of mass destruction
and he used them -— on his own people,”
VV1esel said of Hussein. '

_ Considering Israel and Palestine,
VV1esel said that religious fanatics compli-
cated the situation.

“On one hand, you _have the fanatics,
who teach their children how to die, in
order to kill more men, women and chil-
dren,” he said. .

Wiesel said that many people looked to
the new century with hopes that it would

bring relief from the suffering and war that
ﬁlled the 20th century.

“Three years into the century, where
are we?” he asked. ‘.‘More and more tenor-
ismquestions are being raised.”

‘Terrorism is a celebration of vio-
lence,” he said. . - , ~

But while he said his life is dedicated
to reliving.the suffering of the world, he
maintains a strong sense of humor — and
hope.

‘There must be hope. We c‘armot live
without hope,” VV1esel said, adding that we
must “place it on every level of our exis-
tence.” A

Rioters at WVU deserve punishment 4

West Virginia University offi-

cials are meting out sanctions rang-.

ing from warnings to possible expul-
sions to 40 studentssinvolved in may-
hem after WVU’s Oct. 22 upset-of
the then-No. 3 Virginia Tech.
Students rioted in the streets, set-
ting more than 100 reported fires.
They also stormed the field, attempt-
ing to pull down the goalposts, but

were repulsed by police with pepper .

spray. V

The Office of Student Life will
notify each student of the charges
against him or her in writing.
Perpetrators were identified with the
help of city, state and university

police and firefighters. Charges will
include disorderly conduct, public

intoxication and illegal burning.
School spirit is a great thing. It’s

wonderful to have a student body so

obviously attached to their team.

Setting the streets ablaze, howev- 4

er, is antisocial behavior and should
not be tolerated. It transcends being
true to one’s school, and descends
into thuggery and hooliganism. It
may seem harsh to prosecute excited
fans for celebrating in the street, but

a precedent must be set. WVU cannot .

allow destruction of property and

danger to students to occur wheneverf
football gets exciting.

In addition to getting a well-

rounded education and having fun,"

college is a time to learn how to be

an adult. Students need to learn to ’

have respect for property ’ theirs
and others — and pride in their
hometown, even if it’s only home for
four years. 4 - _
Troublingly,‘ 14 of the students
thus far identified are freshmen.
These youngsters clearly saw their
older classmates indulging in outra-
geous behavior and figured it was the
thing to do. ‘Now, at the beginning of
their college careers, they are already
facing penalties. It’s a reality check.
The ‘students are lucky in that
most of the sanctions‘"wil1 come from
the university and not; the city. A uni-
versity warning is small potatoes

compared to the potential ramifica-

-tions of involvement of city police.

Luckily, no inajorfinjuries were.

reported. The possibility‘ of major
destruction and physical harm in the
face of ﬁres and falling goal posts is
huge. However, the ‘use of pepper
spray by the police could have also
resulted in much harm — but the
officers had to do something. It’s a
shame they had to resort to pepper
spray. ' ,

- Hopefully, this disciplinary dis‘-
asterwill impress upon‘ students the
seriousness of their infractions and.
will prevent future fires, pepper-
sprayings and riots in the streets of
vMorgantown. ' .

Thursday, October 30, 2003

Singer—songwriter Elliott Smith
committed suicide last week, offi-
cially starting what I call the “sea-
son of death.”

For those of you not so in tune
with indie rock, you probably best
know Smith for his song “Miss
Misery,” which guides Matt Damon
through his journeys in the film
“Good Will Hunting.”

For those of you not sure what I
mean by the “season of death,” stay
tuned; you’re already surrounded
by it.

Despite the initial beauty of
fall, it welcomes in a half year of
life ending. The trees wither, the
sun fades away, and the earth loses
heat. Before you know it, winter
comes to town.

In Pittsburgh, winter makes
itself at home. Sunlight has been
known to vanish for weeks, some-
times months, and the town falls
back to a dull shade of gray remi-
niscent of the steel boom’s smog.

While trapped within the dark,
macabre forest of the season of
death, which starts with daylight

. savings stealing an hour of daytime

and ends sometime in March, when
our toes finally thaw, the human
mind undergoes a change.
Psychologists describe this
change as Seasonal Affective

Disorder, or appropriately, S.A.D.

Research behind ‘
S.A.D. concludes that
human beings generally
become more depressed
when they are deprived
of sunlight and warmth
for an extended period of
time.

God knows it had
been a long time since I
had seen the sun when,
freshman year, I was
knee deep in the season
of death.

All I knew was that,
one day, I fell over and didn’t want
to get back up.

It was the start of my first offi-
cial mental breakdown, a downward
spiral that lasted over three months,
until psychological expertise, inner
reconstruction, exercise and dra-
matic weight loss pulled me out of
it. '

Maybe it was just a coincidence,
thetiming and all. If that was meant
to happen to me, it was going to
happen sometime or another, but I
don’t think so.

I wonder if that’s what my uncle
thought a dozen or so years ago. He
had been struggling with depres-
sion, cut himself off from his fami-
ly and hit the bottle hard.

  

David J . McCarthy to

Columnist

One day, he felt that the best
answer was putting a
high-powered hunting
riﬂe in his mouth and
pulling the trigger. It was
right around this time of
year.

All my memories of
my uncle were of . a
happy, joyful man, who
took my cousins and me
McDonald’s for
Happy Meals and joked
that the surprise toy was
broccoli. _

Apparently, something
changed him in the season of death,
because he’s not here to joke with
me anymore.

I believe in S.A.D. I don’t think
that everyone will kill themselves
between now and spring, but I think

we are all a bit more susceptible to -

an empty feeling when the birds
stop chirping and the steam pours

out of our mouths with each breath.

Adam Duritz sings on his song
“A Long December” that “I guess
the winter makes you laugh a little‘
slower / makes you talk a little
lower,” and he’s right. The shadows
get darker around this time of year.

So ladies and gentlemen, enjoy
the crusts of summer. Laugh hard

and‘ fast, and talk high and silly.

With changing seasons comes withering sadness

Store up the sunshine while it’s still
here. Make plans to see your loved
ones, because they’re the people
who will grab your hand if you’re
ever ready to fall over the edge.

Start putting a little something
away in the pantry of your soul, so
come the deadly end of January,
there’s still a bit left.

There’s a sadness that’s build-
ing up now right outside your door.
It’s in the cold puddles you stomp
through on the way to class, and
soon enough, it will freeze over and
be trapped there for quite a while.

Acknowledge it, A and use all
that’s dead to make all that’s alive
stand out. ,

In a Rolling Stone article,
Elliott, Smith addressed claims that
his music was depressing by saying
“there is some sadness in it —= there
has to be, so'the happiness in it will
matter.” _

Smith is gone, but in,his pass-
ing, hopefully he revealed to each

,of us that, especially now, in this

season of death, we who still live,
still matter.

David J. ’s favorite‘Elliott Smith line
is “I’ll fake itthrough thekday with
some he_lp from Johnnie Walker
Red.” E-mailyour favorite lines to

Column just another piece of spin

Dear Editor:

I have read your article by J.P.
Fridy, titled, “Liberal Media con-
spiracy? PIPA study says no.” I
have a few points to say to the
author. If you are going to tout your
liberal, anti—war opinion to the
world by spinning a poll that has
recently come to light, people
should consider other things too.

You say the rest of the world is
against the war. That is not true.
Last time I checked, another pow-
erful nation, Great Britain, is on our
side. Oh, and also Spain. Oh, and
Poland. Oh, and Romania. In fact,

that support this war. Sorry that not
everyone is on your side and many

dent. If the “rest of the world”~con-

sists of France, Germany, and

Russia, I really feel sorry for you.
You also referto it as ‘‘Bush’s

. there are nearly 30 other countries

of us a're‘on the side of our presi- V besides how much you hate Bush?

war.” Well, as an American, it’s my
war too. I support it, and I am sure
that the families of the 300,000
people who the coalition estimates
that Saddam has purportedly killed
are thankful too. It’s kids like you
who run around and listen to the
Beastie Boys, proselytized by their
whining of “Free Tibet.” But when
you do that, do you ever stop to
think “Free Iraq”?

I bet if Bill Clinton or Howard
Dean had gone after Iraq, this arti-
cle would have never been written.
But I guess I know the truth: free-
ing Tibet is cool, because the
Beastie Boys say it, but freeing Iraq
is not, because George Bush sucks?

Talk about spin to get people to
read another insipid anti-Iraq War
opinion article. Do you guys have
something new to talk about

you gain more expertise, you can
identify such adult-industry gems

as Felicia Oh. Search the Internet
' for video of these names! Share

with your friends! Or not! ‘
_ If you do not have the luxury of
a list of names, there are still many
delightful alternatives. The most
obvious activity is, to point out
attractive people in the audience.
An excellent variation on this
theme is to identify" those officers
or leaders in whom you have a car-
nal interest; the best way to do this
is to point and say, ‘‘I’d do her. Or
him.”

Or, to shock your. friends, par-»

ents and parole officers, pick out

’ some obviously underage girls and

say, “Yo, baby, what preschool do
you go to?”

If you are truly fortunate, as the .

meeting winds down, everyone’s
names are called and they file up to
the front of the room. This is the

ultimate opportunity for entertain-

ment. ’ _ .
Whenever ‘an attractive individ-

ual is called, circle the name in
your program. Not only will this

. allow you to start a drunken conver-

sation later, but also the sheer
immaturity of the circling act is an
endless source of mirth. A word of
caution: any females within earshot
will be morbidly offended. The best
thing to do is sit next to ugly girls,

 whose opinions don’t matter.

Just because the meeting is over
doesn’t mean the fun has to be.

Stealing sodas, cookies, and other»

refreshmentsis always a good time;
remember your backpack._

Pick up some moms at the after- '

party; just pretend you’re the milk-
man and they’ll lap it up. As you sit
there in the dark, ‘smoking ciga-

rettes and drinking pilfered soda A

with your favorite MILF, just
remember who got you there.
We like momsitoo. ‘ '

Collin and Joe harbor no ill’ will
toward ugly girls, hunchbacks, or
preschoolers. In fact, our favorite
preschooler is an ugly hunchback.

Not Disney’s best effort 

Brother Bear

Starring the voices of Joaquin
Phoenix, Jeremy Suarez, Rick
Moranis, Dave Thomas
Directed by Aaron Blaise and,
Robert Walker

sit-71371/2

It’s that time of the semester-

again —— midterms are coming to a
close, and we’re all feeling a bit out
of sorts. Reality is just a little too

pressing and all we really want to do _
is regress back to childhood. While .

accomplishing this in actuality
would be extremely difficult — not
to mention disturbing — escapism is

available in the world of the cinema. ~

And where better to turn than to our
old favorites, the animators at
Disney? The newest effort from Walt
Disney Pictures, “Brother Bear,” is a
nice retreat into the simplicity of
childhood.

“Brother Bear” is the story of
Kenai (the voice of Joaquin
Phoenix),‘a young man who, after
killing-a bear, is turned into one
himself. After befriending a lost bear

Jeremy Suarez), Kenai embarks on a
journey that leads to a whole new
perception of the world. Looking at
life through the eyes of the enemy,
he learns the value of all living crea-
tures. Through his relationship with
Koda, he’s finally made aware of
what it means to be a brother.
Everything about this movie has
been seen before. The lesson is
unquestionably played—out; we saw
it in “The Lion King” and “Tarzan,”
among others. The soundtrack is
written and recorded by Phil Collins

—— who also composed the music for.

“Tarzan” — with Tina Turner lend-
ing vocals to one track. The anima-
tion is the same as always, and the
Disney formula, for the most part, is
followed. But then, this is Disney;
did we really. expect it to be other-

story ’ with-. great-

er. It also helps that the roles 
‘were actually created with these
two_actors in mind. All of the
movie’s best and most memorable
lines come from their mouths. They
steal scene after scene, providing
laughs throughout. While all the
characters are likable, these two are
lovable and will be the ones all the
kiddies walking
around quoting for 
the rest of this 
year.

Here’s a suggestion: getrid of 2l—and—over shows

I’m not one of the lucky few thatwill turn 21
before his-senior year. To those of you who will,
congratulations: you are one of the privileged
that will -getto buy alcohol for your friends who
are underage. Me? I still have to depend on the
likes of you fine folk, but that’s not my real
gripe- I ’ j  .

You see, there are people like me on" campus
who go to lots of shows. I admit it; I can be quite
a music whore. Momma didn’t raise no fool. I am

~. well-versed in guitar, bass, drums, keyboard,

clarinet, sax and even the Aborigine didgeridoo.
Now, as :it’s easy to guess, I love music. What
pisses me off is that most of you'can get away

with getting into 21-and-up shows at places "like,

Nick’-s Fat City, or even ‘80s dance night at the
soon-to-be-closed-but-maybe—not Club
Laga/Attic/Upstage. ' *

I’m not going to lie to everyone by saying I
haven’t had a glass of — non-alcoholic —

beer/liquor in my day. Let me tell you, there’s'

nothing like sitting back with some friends and
kicking back some — non-alcoholic — booze.
Butseriously, if I want to attend a good concert,
I don’t need to get drunk to have a good time. I
love Kool-Aid,.;serious1y. '

I just turned 20 on Aug. 7, and that’s going to

stop me from going to a lot of shows and clubs
that I wish I could go to
before my senior year.
It . is debilitating
enough that some of
your favorite bands just
don’t play your city;
it’s a hell of a lot worse
knowing that when
they do, you can’t go
because you’re a damn

 

   

Leo born in 1983. And
it’s not going to‘ be any
easier now that quality
places like Project
1877 and others will be
closing down, and the
final few great shows
around the area are
probably going to be 21’-and-up.

Did it ever occur to anyone that they might
have a better chance of making money by not
making shows 21 and over? Sure, you end up
attracting little teenybopper kids and encourage
high school drama, but those are paying cus-
tomers! And, noting that ticket prices are not get-
ting any lower for shows, who cares if you can’t

idam Raﬁ

 

make money selling alcohol (to underage chil-
dren)?

And hey, in the worst-‘case scenario, you’re
encouraging patrons to drink more to make that
16-year-old that they’re staring at look at least
18. Yee haw! _

It’s a common complaint that some shows are
just “too mature” for'a certain age group. Oh,

Tpish—posh. Tellme that you weren’t pissed that

you couldn’t drive before 16,‘ or that you couldn’t
buy cigarettes and porn until you were 18, let
alone vote, or drive past curfew.-You know you
bent the rules, and that’s not what I’m advocat-
ing. By removing that age restriction, people
won’t be encouraged to be contemptible jerks by
offering various favors to others that I choose not
to get into at‘ this moment. I’m sure club owners
turn their backs to the fact that bands themselves
will let willing fans into shows even though they .
aren’t 21, because of their love of the music.

' Why‘ stop the inevitable? Why -not just let
people pay for their tickets and make your dough

fair and square? If this fails to even break any

waves, I*at least urge all of you club owners to
stop complaining that there aren’t enough cus-
tomers, because you’re limiting yourselves too
much‘ already.

6 Haunted
hayrides make
good dates

DANIEL RICHEY
Staff Writer

I enjoy living up to my role as a
caring, sensitive boyfriend, and I
have to say — Halloween presents a
variety of excellent opportunities
for guys like me to do just that.

Take Cheeseman’s Fright Farm,

for example. It’s everything you’d‘

expect from.,»..a typical Western
Pennsylvania farmland experience
—— good people, beautiful, rolling
hills, guys with Chainsaws all up in
your face and splendid chilidogs.

I Just off of Route 19 in Portersville,

the farm runs its “Haunted Hayride
and Pumpkin Festival” throughout
the month of October. While most
of the many patrons you’re likely to
see on a Friday night are families

»— your typical good, salt—of—the—

earth people — it’s’ also fine mater-
ial for a date.

After all, what’s more fun for a
young couple than being carted out
into the middle of some field under

‘ an utterly black sky, only to be
assaulted by flying demons, axe— ~

wielding maniacs and’: freaky hell-
hounds. with glowing eyes? You’ll
confront plenty of_ these just on the
hayride out to the disturbing,‘
strobe—lit hay maze, which, of
course, leads to a haunted house
that is quite literally in the middle
of the woods. The isolated feel of it
all is what really gives
Cheeseman’s Fright Farm an edge.
There’s something about finally
escaping‘ the ghouls and demons
that have been lunging at you all
evening, only to be confronted with
seemingly endless dark woods on
all sides. ‘

And that’s where I, the sensitive
boyfriend come in. For example,
while my girlfriend was locked in

the throes of what looked to be a .

very real, torrid fear, I calmed her
by saying soothing things like,

, “You know, if this tractor breaks
- down, we mayhave to stay in these

woods all ‘night,” and “I bet if
you’re just polite to the chainsaw
guy, _he’l.l consider not splitting
your skull open.” ' A _

Cheesemanfs Fright Farm runs its

haunted hayride and its non—fright-

ening daytime counterpart through
Nov. 1. Admission is $10 and $4
respectively. An awesome chili-
cheese dog will onlyicost you a
buck and change, too.

Director’s cut of “Alien” better than most re—release efforts

Alien: Director’s Cut  
Starring Sigourney Weaver, Tom
Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm,
Harry Dean Stanton

Directed by Ridley Scott
sksfnkﬁ

Another classic; another re-release.
Another inﬂuential ﬁlm made 20 years ago;
another ﬁlm whose director wants to make
it “better” by putting new stuff in.

This is the same song and dance ﬁlm
fans have had to deal with when such ﬁlms
as the ﬁrst “Star Wars’ movies and “ET.”
were re-released, right? 0

Wrong.

True, “Alien: Director’s Cut” is a re-
release of the classic 1979 ﬁlm that has
inﬂuenced sci-ﬁ, horror and all other genres
of cinema Also true, director Ridley Scott
has gone back into his work and tweaked it
But the difference between this “director’s
cut” and the “special edition” director cuts
of the “Star Wars” movies — Jabba the
Hutt in the ﬁrst ﬁlm just doesn’t work — is
that Scott’s cut works just as well, if not bet-
ter, than the original cut of the ﬁlm.

Scott isn’t new to this reworking game.
His classic sci-ﬁ ﬁlm “Blade Runner” went
under this process once — and there’s a
possible second director’s cut in the works
— after Scott was dissatisﬁed with the stu-
dio’s insisting that certain scenes be
removed to play better in theaters. The

results of that work made for a better ﬁlm
with many of its narrative questions
answered, or, at the very least, made a little
clearer.
And that’s what happens with “Alien.”
The ﬁlm that warned, “In space, no
oneican hear you scream,” returns to the-
aters with new scenes ﬂawlessly added into
the narrative‘ — scenes that ﬂesh out the
story of Ripley (Sigoumey Weaver), Dallas
(Tom Skerritt) and the rest of the crew of
the starship N ostromo, and their battle with
the pure-evil alien killing machine.
A Two of these scenes were available on

the last DVD edi-
tion of the ﬁlm, but
not in the ﬁlm itself
—~ they were extra
features indepen-
dent of the ﬁlm.
The ﬁrst is a
'scene sandwiched
between the retum
of Dallas, 
( V e r o n. i c a
Cartwright) and
Kane (John Hurt),
who is being smoth-
ered by a facehug-
ger, and the begin-
ning of the attempts
to remove the face-'
hugger from Kane’s
head
The newly restored scene shows an
angry Lambert smacking Ripley for not
opening up the ship’s doors to let the team
back onto the ship for fear of breaking
quarantine laws .— the team only gets back
on the ship when_science ofﬁcer Ash (Ian
Holm) disobeys- Ripley’s order. The new .
scene clariﬁes much of the animosity
Lambert shows towards Ripley throughout
the most of the rest of the ﬁlm and, by
doing so, makes both characters that much
fuller.
The other new scene is one that many
fans of the ﬁlm have been anxious about. It

 

comes near the end of the ﬁlm, after 

is the only one left alive on the ship. II1stead S

of rimning. ﬁom the bridge of the ship,
through the ship to ﬁnd her cat, back to the
bridge, then onto the escape ship, she now
stumbles across an Alien hive where Dallas
and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), both vic-
tims of the Alien, are being used to breed
more of the killer creatures.

Not toreveal too much of the scene,
since it is anticipated by fans of the ﬁlm, it’s
incredibly effective. It shows more of
Ripley’s character and the relationship she
has with Dallas. There is a longer Version of

this scene on the last DVD release of the ,

ﬁlm, but the scene that has been put back
into the ﬁlm has been trimmed of the fat
and, as a result, ﬁts so wellwith the rest of
the _ﬁlm that it’s a wonder it was cut out in
the ﬁrst place. , = .

And that’s how all the additions and
subtractions -1- there are bits trimmed here
and there from the original ﬁlm ‘—-— in
“Alien: Director’s Cut” exist. Nothing is
extraneous, and everything works.

Scott deserves a lot of credit for
achieving such fantastic results and 20th
Century Fox for allowing him to go back
and create the deﬁnitive “Alien.” Too bad
other directors — like George Lucas -
with such grandiose visions can’t reach the
same, wonderful ends. .

How to Hunt Ghosts: A
Practical Guide
Joshua P. Warren

Firestone Books
7i‘n£‘r>i‘r

Maybe you’ve seen the movie
“Ghost.” Maybe you’Ve seen
“Ghostbusters,” or ‘The Frighteners.” But
have you ever thought that, maybe, there’s
a scientiﬁc explanation that is the motiva-
tion for those movies?

No, seriously. Have you?

All right, so the idea of ghosts isn’t
exactly “conventional.” Ghosts are, more
often than not, considered a concept of
fantasy that is used to explain the unex-
plainable. But Joshua P. Warren gives jus-
tice to the arguments for the existence of
ghosts.

Warren took on a difﬁcult task: trying
to explain to the world that ghosts do
indeed exist. He’s heard all the skeptical
arguments: those who see ghosts are real-
ly insane, ghosts are just an excuse for a
cheap costume on Halloween, ghosts are
merely optical illusions or people wearing
ghost costumes, as demonstrated in the
‘60s classic cartoon “Scooby-Doo. But
those skeptics haven’t been to actual
haunted houses and heard documented
recordings of sounds like footsteps up a
staircase in a Louisiana home, nor have
they been to Asheville, N.C., to see the
fabled ghost of the Grove Park Irm.

Although there have been writers
who have written pieces similar to
Warren’s 5‘How to Hunt Ghosts,” no
writer has done it so well. The concepts
and arguments in Warren’s book could ﬁll

volumes, yet he makes it easy on the read-
er with a simple, 100-page breakdown on
the actual existence of ghosts. What make
the book amazing, though, is its thorough-
ness within such a small amount of pages
and Warren’s rarely ﬂawed arguments.

' Warren really hits the nail on the head
in his attempts to prove his ‘logic. He talks
about the arguably proven existence of
etheric bodies (better known as “souls”),
the amazing tools created to help prove
ghostly experiences and the recordings
and documentations he’s made of his first-
hand experiences with ghosts, but he does
it with the lucidity of an owner’s manual.
Everything he states is so simple, yet so
accurately expressed and argued.

Warren’s biggest fault, however, is
how thin his arguments are. On his Web
site, www.howtohuntghosts.com, there
are very few actual photos, and, judging
from the book, there should’ve been at
least a few dozen. The Web site, of course,
isn’t nearly as detailed as this book.

There’s a lot of subjectivity on the
topic, though. What constitutes as a pho-
tograph of a ghost and what a mistake
with the ﬁlm? Who’s to say what a ghost
is and what _a ghost isn’t? Warren rarely
displays his biases, but they are there.

Despite the ﬂaws, this book is well-
argued, well—written and hard to put
down. Even though you’re only hearing
about it from one person’s biased perspec-
tive, this book is remarkably believable.

This book may sound like a joke, but
it’s dead serious — pun intended.

Bottom Line: this book is perfect for
open-minded and well-rounded readers.

Eminem, 50 Cent

The fact that his real name is
Obie Trice might be the only thing
this rapper has going for him. His
debut album, Cheers, is an ordinary
collection of tracks that lack much
originality or excitement. Even
with Eminem as executive produc-
er, the beats and rhymes don’t stand
out from most other rap CDs.

Another one of Eminem’-s pro-,

     
   

 



 

     

Thursday; OCt(”)bcf5r‘,3’0, 2003

teges, Obie Trice doesn’t have the
same kind of gun-slinging charisma
that 50 Cent does. He raps on beat
and his rhymes are primarily_ about
women, violence and liquor.
Nothing is outstanding about the
way he raps or the subjects he raps
about. Most of the songs seem more
like background noise; stop paying
attention for a minute and they
could easily be missed. ,

Obie Trice only raps by himself
on six out of 17 tracks on the
album. Most of his songs feature

 another rapper, such as Eminem, 50

Cent or Busta Rhymes. These col-
laborations help the album, but
sometimes the guest rapper over-
shadows Trice, and there’s no real
sense of whatkind of songs and
beats he would produce, without the
star power of Eminemq

There are some catchy tracks on

the album. His first ‘single, “Got
Some Teeth,” is the kind of pop/rap
that would appeal to a large audi-
ence. The track “S—— Hits the Fan”
features Eminem singing the hook

while Trice and Dr. Dre challenge -
some of their enemies. “Don’t

Come Down” takes a look into
Trice’s childhood and his relation-
ship with his mother.

However, the few good tracks
don’t make up for the overall lack-
luster tone of the entire CD. There’s
not much emotion in Trice’s rap
style, and that’s another reason the
album is simply average. He does-
n’t showcase that unique MC talent
that Eminem must have found
intriguing when he decided to sign
Obie Trice to Shady Records. Most
of the songs are safe and common-
place. In the end, Obie Trice’s

Cheers just doesn’t offer much to '

cheer about. ‘ . 4

In light of team’s poor performance and off-field
problems, it may be time for Paterno to step down

SPORT   

 

-It seems like things just keep
getting worse for our friends over in
State College. Right now, Penn State
is 2-6, but surprisingly, that isn’t the
biggest problem Joe Paterno faces.

Looking over the list of off-the-
field problems Penn State has had
this year, you might get confused
and think that you’re reading a
script from _ESPN’s “Playmakers.”
With seven players involved in sep-
arate off-field problems, this team
has gotten out of control.

On Tuesday, Paterno announced
that the team’s leading receiver,
Tony Johnson, would remain ‘sus-
pended for Saturday’s game against
Ohio State after being charged with
drunk driving. At the same press

conference, Paterno also announced
that lineman Tom McHugh was dis-
missed from the team after being
charged with public drunkenness,
underage drinking, and allegedly
slapping a woman. The charges
came just hours after Paterno had
warned players to -watch their
behavior.

These off—field distractions have

been happening all season long,’

leaving Paterno wishing that the
lack of talent were the only problem
his team had.

It all started when Anwar
Phillips was charged with sexual
assault last summer. Although
Phillips was acquitted days before
the season opener, it still had to be
quite a distraction. Shortly there-
after, lineman E.Z. Smith was cited
twice in the same week for underage
drinking. .

Twice in the same week? Come
on, you’ve got to be kidding me.

Alcohol charges were also
brought up against punter Jeremy
Kapinos, and defensive lineman
Scott Paxson was charged with

cle. A

Wait  What?

Linebacker Dethrell Garcia was
also charged with a DUI, but maybe
we shouldn’t count this one, since
he quit the team before being arrest-
ed.

Paterno said that this season has
been the toughest of his 54-year
career, and rightfully so. But things
don’t look like they’re going to get
any easier for Joe-Pa and the Nittany
Lions. _ ‘

This weekend, they take on Ohio
State, who may not be playing like
national champs, but are still seven-
point, favorites on the road this
Saturday.

Penn State will, at best, finish 4-
8 this year. Although that will surely
bring a smile to most fans here at
Pitt, Joe Paterno is ruining his lega-
cy as one of the best college football
coaches in history. ‘

This week’s events are proof that
Paterno has lost control of his team.
Coming into this season, Penn State

alumni and fans were mostly con-
cerned with the fact that Paterno was
failing to get the kind of recruits he
had always gotten in the past.

Many believed that the top
recruits would not feel comfortable
committing to a program that had a
head coach who would more than
likely not be around for four years.

Now the problems are much
worse. Paterno has said that he has
no plans to ‘retire, but if he truly
cares about what is best for the pro-

gram, he must step down at the end

of this season.
He certainly won’t be going out
on top, but that does not seem possi-

ble'anymore. Paterno was a great ‘

coach, and he should be remembered
as such. But there comes a time in a
man’s life when he just has to know
it’s time to walk away. It is time for
Paterno to walk away.

Ryan Walker is a columnist for The
Pitt News, and he knows that this
column will bring tears to the eyes
of his stepfather. Don ’t worry, Dave,

Swimming and diving prepare for season

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer '

When it comes to Pitt athletics,
one of the best-kept secrets is the
success of the men’s and women’s
swimming and diving teams.

Since .joining the Big East
Conference in 1982, the women
have won the Big East title 10 times,
while the menhave won an unprece-
dented l8 titles.

These athletes know their sport
does not garner much attention, but
that has no effect on their work ethic

or their will to keep winning. For g

swimmers like senior Eric
Limkemann, competing has nothing
to do with personal glory.

“I know swimming isn’t a glam-S

our sport,” Limkemann said. “We
don’t usually draw the big crowds.

Those are just things you deal with i

when you’re a swimmer. You don’t
do it for the recognition; you do it
because you love the‘ sport.” '

Pitt’s
teams put in long hours up at Trees
Pool. Senior Jenny Livingstone
knows the type of commitment it
takes to be a swimmer, but the ful-
fillment she feels is what makes it
all worthwhile. _

“You have to make sacrifi_ces,”
Livingstone said. “Sometimes you
do think, ‘What am I missing?’ But
in the. end, the feeling, the satisfac-
tion you get out of it is a feeling that
you’ll never get anywhere else.
You’ll never have that feeling. Being
a part of the team is just something
more.”

All thehard work and dedication
has paid off over the years, but head»
coach Chuck Knolessaid, previous
success has nothing to do with get-
ting it done this year. Knoles’ team
is never satisfied. ,

He said that each year, the team
keeps raising the bar, and this year,
the men have their sights set on
more than just the Big East title.

“Winning a Big East title is fine
and dandy, but. that’s all it is,”
Knoles said. “It’s not a tremendous
accomplishment as far as stretching
yourself at the national level is con-
cerned.” '

The women have also set out to
improve from last year’s fifth—p1ace
finish. Senior Carolyne Savini said
that finishing less than third in the
Big East is not an option. The
women are especially looking to
knock off their longtime rival Notre
Dame.

According the

to Knoles,

’women’s team has’ really improved
_ on their times since last year, but

they have also matured. Hesaid the
maturity the women_ have shown

1..-.~...,-...-...-—.'-.4--r--.--~.ur--4-4-r'I'I" -‘F .. .. -. v. - VD - .-.-..~..—_ _.

should carry them a long way this
season.

“Beating Notre Dame is a doable
thing, depending on how much our
girls want to hurt,” Knoles said.
“The women are becoming tough,
and that’s not the bad tough, that’s a
good tough. It’s nice to see that ath-
letic toughness start to take hold.
We’re far less emotional than we’ve
been in the past. Far fewer breaks in
emotion, fewer tears, and I think the
women. are becoming top level, elite,
Division I athletes. And I think
that’s what it’s all about.”

The coaches and players are

excited about getting this season
underway. All of the hard work will
be put to the test this weekend, and
Knoles is confident that his team
will perform. ,

“The kids are really getting
ready to compete,” Knoles said.
“We’ve had lots of training, but not
really many meets. We’ve got our
first competition [this] week against
St. Bonaventure on Friday and then
against Syracuse on Saturday. I think
that the proof will be in the pudding
when we get to those competitions,
but I think we’re going to see quite
an improved team this year.”

Swimming and diving 101: terms and rules to know

ADAM FLEMING
, Staff Writer

Swimming and- diving are best
described as team sports of individuals.
That is to say: swimmers win races;
teams win meets.

‘ A dual meet for the aquatics teams
usually follows a default order of events,
with each race scoring points that even-
tually comprise the team’s ﬁnal score.

If a team amasses. 121 points, it is
guaranteed a win.

Individual races and diving events
award nine points for a first-place ﬁnish,
four for second, three for third, two for
fourth and one point for a ﬁfth—place ﬁn-
ish.

Relays, races involving teams of
four swimmers, confer 11 points for ﬁrst
place, four for second and two for third.

At maximum, three swimmers for
each team are allowed to score in any
individual event. Two groups of swim-
mers may score for each team in relays.

In swimming, there are four strokes:
the backstroke, breaststroke, butterﬂy
and freestyle. ti

Backstroke features the swimmer on
his or her back with rotating arrris and
ﬂutter kicking.

Breaststroke is done with the lswirn'i- -

mer looking forward, repeatedly pulling
and kicking in horizontal circular
motions. I

In the butterﬂy, dolphin—like in its
arc, the swimmer must extend his or her
arms simultaneously forward, keeping
legs together and pulsating.

In freestyle events, aswimmer may
use any of the other three strokes, but
almost always, an athlete chooses the
crawl stroke, a stomach,-down rhythmic
rotation of the arms accompanied by a
ﬂutter kick. ' P , .

A typical dual meet contains 13
events for each gender. Men’s and
women’s teams‘ score separately.
Usually, women’s events will race
before the men. '

A meet begins with the 400—yard
medley relay. Four swimmers form a
team in which each swimmer must swim
100 yards. The first does backstroke, the
next breaststroke, followed by the but-
terﬂy, and the last swimmer, races
freestyle. ' I : — I

The meetcloses with the 400—yard

freestyle relay, in which all four swim-

mers compete in freestyle.

In between the relays, = the teams
race in individual competitions that
include the 50-, 100-, 200-, 500- and
1,000—yard freestyle -races; a 200—yard
event in each of the other three strokes;
and a 200—yard individual medley,
which has one swimmerswimrning 50

Divers compete in two events, at
heights of one meter and three meters,
which take place one-third of the way

meet, respectively. Diving is judged by
the officials with consideration of diffi-

The Daily Athenaeum (U-wire, West Virginia)

(U-WIRE) MORGANTOWN, W.Va.
—.West Virginia University offi-
cials have begun the first step in
disciplining students involved in
what they deem irresponsible
behavior following _Wednesday’s
football win over Virginia Tech
University.

Kim Mosby, assistant dean of

Student life, said the WVU adminis-

tration is still in the information-
gathering stage.

This step, which involves
reviewing citations that were issued
Wednesday night as well as review-
ing video footage, will help offi-
cials determine who was involved
in punishable behavior.

“I’ll then meet with those stu-
dents individually and decide if
they will be sanctioned,” Mosby
said, referring to Wednesday’s post-
game activities, in which some
WVU students were sprayed with
pepper spray after allegedly charg-
ing law enforcement officials. She
is currently anticipating speaking
with 30 to 40 students.. -

Different measures of discipli-

nary action will be takenebased on . _

the ‘level of involvement for each
student that is reviewed,‘ she said.
“It depends on what the individ-
uals are doing.” said Ken Gray,
vice-president for student affairs.
He added that if a student is simply
standing around in the footage
reviewed, they will not be punished.

The WVU athletics department,

and the Department of Public

Safety have already reviewed the

footage from Mountaineer Field,
Gray said. .

, Gray was one of many universi-
ty officials involved with the plan-
ning of post-game control mea-
sures. ,

“We did a number of different
things, asking fans to be good
sports,” he said, referring to mes-
sages sent to students prior to
Wednesday’s game. “Anything less

than that would not be tolerated.’

The same went for destruction of

property.”
The messages were sent to stu-
dents via the school’s MIX e-mail

and messaging system, as well as
public service announcements on
the radio.

Gray believes that those mes-
sages got consumed by other infor-
mation regarding the game. He said
that, among other measures, the
administration will ensure that sim-
ilar messages sent to students in the
future will be made clearer.

“What” we expected to happen
was everyone would be good
sports,” Gray said.

He added that the university
officials prefer no one go onto the

field, but they do recognize that it is
symbolic of celebration, and can be
unavoidable.

“It was really about safety,”
Gray said.

He cited the injuries sustained
by students at the University of
Toledo a few weeks prior, when a
goal post was toppled following
their win over the University of
Pittsburgh.

“These goalposts [we have now}

are even heavier than before,” he
said. “We’re going to try to make
the safety measure more clear in the
future.”

Gray added that such forceful

measures taken by state police
wouldn’t have been taken if stu-
dents had continued to celebrate
without charging the troopers.

He also noted a similar’ upset

‘that occurred in the world of college

football over the weekend — that of

Bowling Green State University

over Northern Illinois University.
“The [BGSU] fans celebrated,

_but peacefully,” he said.

In the BGSU post—game com-
mentary, a student was asked why
he thought he and his peers weren’t
trying to upset the goalposts after
such an important victory.

'Gray said the student responded

For now, Gray and other univer-
sity officials plan to work with stu-
dents and fans to develop a new
plan for keeping post—game celebra-
tions just that -— celebrations.

“We’ve already received a lot of
ideas of what to do,” Gray said. The
group will look at the remaining
games for this season, all of which
are scheduled in the afternoon.
Beyond that, Gray said, they plan to
develop a long-term solution, start-
ing with next season. _ a

“Working together, we’ll come
up with a solution for this,” Gray
said.

In Pitt’s previous trip to Van

Diano finished fourth, behind his
three freshmen teammates.

“We’re going to taper down this

vidual runner, advance beyond the
conference championships, the
