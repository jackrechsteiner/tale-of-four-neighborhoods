A VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 89

  Judge rules

to halt Case
for beneﬁts

The Pitt News

Christine Biancheria is not
happy, but she’s not surprised.

She’s also not done fighting.

On Monday, a judge handed
down a permanent injunction, bar-
ring Pitt employees from proceed-
ing with claims that they were

wrongly denied health insurance.

for their gay and lesbian partners.
Allegheny County Common Pleas
Judge Robert C. Gallo’s decision
was the latest event concerning an
8-year-old case brought forth by
seven current and former Pitt
employees in a dispute over domes-
tic partner benefits.

A Biancheria, who is handling the
case for the plaintiffs on behalf of
the American Civil - Liberties
Union, said that the decision was
“disappointing,” but not a major
surprise, largely because Gallo had
issued the preliminary injunction
against the plaintiffs in the case
years ago.

“There are so many errors, and
such big errors, that  there is an
excellent chance of a reversal,” she
said about the decision by Judge
Robert C._ Gallo.

Biancheria said that she and the
plaintiffs ‘were discussing the
future of the case, but that they
were “well set for anappeal.”

Flu may have peaked at Pitt, but outbreak isn’t over

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

The doctors and nurses at Student
Health Services still haven’t found a cure
for the common cold.

They can, however, help you get over
the ﬂu — if you visit them early.

If caught on the ﬁrst day, ﬂu symp-
toms can be relieved with medicines avail-
able from Student Health Services. But by
the third or fourth day, it’s too late to do
anything. 1

Even if students can make it to the
doctor in time, some don’t go because they
don’t know what they have.

‘The real difference between a regular
cold and inﬂuenza is the rapidity of onset
with the ﬂu,” said Pamela Talley, a staff
physician working with Student Health
Services. .

Flu and cold symptoms can be diﬁi—
cult to distinguish, and both can even carry
a fever, according to Talley. She said the ﬂu
usually brings a deeper, more prominent
cough and more body aches than a cold
might, and the ﬂu is typically more intense
for many days, while a cold usually does
not remain intense for more than 48 hours.

If a student realizes she has the ﬂu
after 48 hours, however, it’s too late to get
ﬂu-ﬁghting medicine.

For the week of Dec. 28 through Jan.
3, Pennsylvania continued to experience
widespread outbreaks of the ﬂu, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. During the same week,
inﬂuenza and pneumonia were responsible
for 9.4 percent of all deaths reported by the
vital statistics oﬂices of 122 U.S. cities,
according to the CDC. The epidemic
threshold for deaths caused by a speciﬁc
disease is 8 percent. ’

Information concerning the week of
‘Jan. 4 through Jan. 11 was not available
from the CDC at the time of publication.
Information about the previous week was
released in a report on Jan. 8.

But'Pitt students need not go into self-
imposed quarantine just yet. According to
Talley, the ﬂu seemed to peak in the region
a few weeks ago.

“Our impression here is that it peaked
during ﬁnals week,” Talley said of the con-
veniently timed ﬂu outbreak at Pitt. “We
saw lots and lots of sick, sick people before
the break.”

Since students returned from winter
break to classes on Jan. 5, however, they
have not sought the services of Student
Health quite as anxiously as they did in
December, Talley said.

“Locally, I think that it

V H peaked
already,” she explained. ‘

According to a Friday, Jan. 9 report in i

the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, however, the

Allegheny County ,Health Department

does not yet expect relief from extreme
. numbers of inﬂuenza cases. .

“I do not think this isan end to the sea-
son, or even that things have [peaked] yet,”
said David Zazac, a county Health
Department spokesman, to- the Post-
Gazette.

VV1th 605 conﬁrmed cases between the
middle of November and Jan. 7, Allegheny
County has had the largest number of cases
in a single season since tl'l6 Health Dept.
began formally monitoring the ﬂu seasons
during the 1991-1992 season, according to
Allegheny County’s Web site. The previ-
ous record of 154 cases was set in the
1999-2000 season. 1

Although the number probably

8 reﬂects an intense season of ﬂu activity, it

has also grown because of increasingly
effective, simple methods for testing and
conﬁrming ﬂu cases in doctors’ offices,
‘according to the Web site.

“Many people who,get sick do not
seek treatment or may ‘not be tested for
inﬂuenza,” the Web site reported. “For
every conﬁrmed case, hundreds of others
may go ‘unreported and uncounted.” ._

Students still anxious about the ﬂu
may be able to get a ﬂu shot,‘ since the
Health Dept. received an additional 2,000

doses and reopened » its ﬂu immunization —
A. clinic on J an. 8, after being closed for about
— four weeks because they ran out of the vac-

cine. Many medical facilities ranout‘ of ﬂu
shots when public demand jumped in
response to the early ﬂu season in
December. — " 
“It peaked early this year, and people
panicked a little,” Talley said. The addi-
tional ﬂu shots may be reserved for people
at high risk — those with ongoing illness-
es like asthma or diabetes, as well as those
working with young children or in health

' care facilities. ’
Students with cold symptoms should

wait seven to 10 days before visiting
Student Health Services. Cold. symptoms
should calm within 10 days, but symptoms
lasting beyond that might indicate a more

' serious problem, such as a sinus infection
or bronchial infection. Such infections can
be treated with medicine. ’ V i

Foster, page 1

a Pittsburgh area native, had his life
commemorated Tuesday, which
marked the 140th anniversary of his
death. The celebration started at the
Allegheny Cemetery and then con-
tinued at Pitt’s Stephen Foster
Memorial.

“He was a pioneer,” Deane L.
Root said of Foster at the ceremony.

songs at the event.

Foster wrote such »
classics as “Camptown Races,”
“Oh! Susanna” and “Jeanie with the

1 Light Brown Hair,” during his
' rather short career. Thoughhe

wrote his firstsong when he was
just 20 years old, he died at age 37
with just a few cents in his pocket.

‘Foster was born on July 4, 1826
in Lawrenceville, Pa., and died Jan.

_l3, 1864.

Foster’s link to Pitt began near
the turn of the 20th century when

‘the Tuesday Musical Club was

founded. This group of Pittsburgh
women, who performed and lis-
tened to classical music together,
wanted‘ to create a permanent place

for themselves ‘and their collec-
tions. So the club’s president
approached then Pitt Chancellor
John Gabbart Bowman about creat-
ing a memorial in Foster’s honor.

Bowman agreed to have the’

Memorial built as a ‘part of his
three—prong approach to the new
Oakland campus.

The three central buildings on
the campus would be the Cathedral

Islamic Studies Group bringing in speakers, correcting misconceptions

ISG, page 1

an educational group than aministry, and
it hosts lectures and discussions about
Islamic beliefs, practices and history. Its
mission is to “contribute to intercultural,
interfaith friendship; contribute to the dia-
logue and mutual understanding between
Islam and other religions; and educate peo-
ple about Islam.”

Karaman added that the group’s for-
mation was particularly timely because of
the misconceptions some people had about
Islam after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“[After Sept. 11, 2001,] we observed
the stupid things people think about Islam
because they don’t know [about the reli-
gion],” Karaman said. “They did not learn
about it sometime, somewhere in their life-
times.”

Indeed, there is much to learn about
Islam, a 1,400-year-old religion that is cur-
rently practiced by an estimated 1.2 billion
people —- a ﬁfth of the world’s population.

Islam was founded in what is now
Saudi Arabia in the seventh cent11ry by
Mohammad, whom Muslims believe was
the last of a series of prophets. Mohammad
preached submission to the will of a single,
all-powerful God. The strict monotheism
he taught contrasted with the predominant
polytheistic religions of the area. Muslims
also recognize Mohammed as the author
of _tl1e holy book of Islam, the Koran.

By 750, Islam had become the most.

prominent religion of the Middle East and
had spread to parts of Africa, Asia and
Europe. Today, Islam is in a period of
growth and, if trends continue, will be the
world’s largest religion by 2050.

Despite its expansion, Islam has
become controversial in the West.
Extremists responsible for hostility against
Israel, violence against U.S. interests over-
seas and the Sept.‘ 11, 2001, attacks, have
inspired the most newsworthy stories

about Muslims, overshadowing the reli—_

gion’s peaceful majority, according to
Karaman.

- ISG hopes to brighten Pitt students’
conceptions of Muslims with its discus-
sions and lectures. ‘ I .

“Many people who have attended our

events have said they learned a lot and
their perspectives have changed a lot,”
Kararnan said. .
The academics and experts ISG has
invited have lectured about women in

1 Islam, the importance of prayer in the reli-

gion, the Islamic conception of God and
the Islamic View of Sept. 11, 2001.

Many of the group’s events are meant
to create a dialogue between Muslims and
people of other religions.

“We realize that not all the people in
the U.S. know too much about Islam —
[not] as much as they know about
Christianity or about Judaism,” said ISG
member Ahrnet Kaya “We want to make
a connection between two religions or

three religions, to understand each other.
So we sometimes call speakers to talk
about Christianity or Jesus in Islam, and
other cross-subjects.”

The group has sponsored Dr. Bekir
Aksoy, a prominent speaker on interfaith
relations, who addressed what Judaism,
Christianity and Islam have in common as
Abraharnic religions — those that trace
their roots to the prophet Abraham. They
also hosted a discussion about Jesus’
standing as an important prophet in Islam.

Kararnan said his favorite lecture was

« given by physicist and Islam scholar Salih

Aden1,_ who compared the mysticism of
the Suﬁ sect of Islam to concepts found in
the popular “The Matrix” ﬁlms. Kararnan

noted that it is sometimes difﬁcult to make
people interested in Islam and said that
relating the religion to a popular ﬁlm
brought out a sizeable crowd.

_ Tomorrow, the group will hold its ﬁrst
event of the year, a discussion entitled
“Islam, A Healing to Our Irmer and Social
Problems.” The event will be held in room
511 of William Pitt Union. '

Even if students do not attend one of
the group’s events, Karaman hopes they
will be sensitive concerning the Islamic
religion.

“When we believe in something and
people are insulting it — sometimes pur-
posefully, sometimes not purposefully —
we are hurt.”

ACLU attorney, Rainbow Alliance
member expect case to continue

some recent state court decisions.

Without the permanent injunc-

tion, the case would have gone
before the Pittsburgh Commission
on Human Relations.

Gallo, whose four—page opinion
was released Monday, said the com-
mission could not hearthe case
because it lacks jurisdiction under
law for such matters, according to
report in the Tuesday, Jan. 13 issue
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The commission, after review-
ing the case in 1997 and finding
probable cause of discrimination on
the part of Pitt, planned to hear the
case in September
1999. Gallo ruled
over the suit Pitt
filed in response,
however, and
granted a’ tempo-
rary injunction,
delaying the 1999
hearing. Under his
new ruling, the
hearing will not
occur.

Gallo wrote in
his ruling this time
that Pitt “has "no
legal obligation 
to offer [a] med-
ical insurance ben-
efit under its
health insurance
program to the
domestic partners of its employ-
ees,”according to the Post-Gazette.

The Post—G-azette reported that
Gallo also wrote that “the universi-
ty has demonstrated that its right to
relief is clear.” _ '

But while Gallo’s ruling disap-
pointed Biancheria,
attorney found more frustration in
Pitt’s response -— a lawyer repre-
senting Pitt described the decision
as a vindication to the Post-Gazette.

Pitt’s attitude, Biancheria said,
was even more disappointing than
the decision.

“The sad fact is that the
University just won for itself, at
least temporarily, the right to dis-
criminate against its employees,”
she said. “And from the comments
in the papers, they’re out there cel-
ebrating.” _

Pitt’s Vice Chancellor for
Public Affairs Robert Hill released
a statement in response to Gallo’s
ruling.‘

“Although the University of
Pittsburgh always maintained that
litigation was not the proper forum
to settle the issue of domestic part-
ner health insurance benefits, we

Pitt “has no legal
obligation  to ,
oﬁer [a] medical .
insurance program

partners of its
employees. ”

the ACLU _

are, of course, pleased that the .

court agrees with our legal posi-
tions that the city ordinance never
required us to offer the benefits and
that using marriage as a basis for
offering the benefits is not discrim-
inatory,” Hill wrote.

Hill said last year that a com-
mittee Pitt organized to study the
effects of granting full benefits to
the same—sex partners of employees
recommended a mu1tilateral,solu--
tion, with every state-related uni-
versity working together.

“We’re still hopeful for resolu-
tion along those lines,” Hill said in
January 2003, less than a month
before Temple University, a state-
jrelated ‘college
‘with a relationship
to the state com-
parable to Pitt’s,
began providing
benefits for the
domestic partners
of its employees.

Biancheria
said that support
for the plaintiffs
has grown over

going to be the
last university in
the country to do
this,” Biancheria
said. “I' don’t
know
proud of that.” .

But Sean McCarthy, the social
chair forRainbow Alliance, did not
see the judge’s ruling as the end of
the fight.

“This is something that we real-
ly want to fight for, and this is
something that we really believe
in,” McCarthy said.

“I think we still have a fight, as
long as people care,” he added. ‘‘I
don’t think we’re done.” i’

.Asked what he believed could
be done to improve the chances of

the case in the future, McCarthy A

replied that he‘ thinks educationis
an important factor in the issue.
“There are people who still
don’t know about what’s going on,”
McCarthy explained, adding that he
feels more people would disagree
with Pitt if they understood the
details of the case. ,
‘‘It’s all about organization and
group power over the situation,”
McCarthy said. He considers per-
sistence to be a big help in gaining

support and bringing about change. ‘

Same‘-sex benefits ruling disappointing

Pitt won the right to continue dis-
criminating against its gay and lesbian
employees Jan. 12 — at least until the
eight-year—1ong, same-sex benefits
court case is appealed — in a victory
that will hopefully be short—lived.

Allegheny County Common Pleas
Judge Robert Gallo ruled that Pitt was

not subject to a City of Pittsburgh Civil ,

Rights ordinance, citing a 91999
Pennsylvania law that exempts state
and state-related universities from
local ordinances concerning health
beneﬁts.

Of course, this law was passed for
the express purpose of exempting Pitt
from the ordinance in question, which
makes this ruling no surprise. And Pitt
won not by an actual decision in their
favor, but by exploiting a matter of
protocol, and one created on account of
the University.

Justice should not hinge on matters‘

of protocol. Pitt should stop hiding
behind this convenient hedge and
address the issue at hand — granting
benefits to a small number of workers,

. which would surely cost less than this

lengthy legal proceeding and certainly
bring the University better press.
During this legal battle, Pitt has pre-
sented itself as diametrically opposed
to civil rights, which is the worst PR
anyone could ask for.

Pitt, in proscribing Pitt Script and
embroidering University of Pittsburgh
on everything— ya know, to class

things up a bit —— wants to be both elite
and part of the city. Denying these ben-
efits makes us part of a bigoted elite.
And moving to strike ordinances, seek-
ing exemptions and generally distanc-
ing itself from the city doesn’t achieve
this goal — and now no one can buy
simple Pitt shirts, either.

And the arguments Pitt presents
for why this handful of workers should
not be granted benefits are facile at
best and thinly veiled homophobia at
worst.

Temple University, Pennsylvania’s
other urban, large state-related univer-
sity, granted same-sex benefits last
summer, without censure from
Harrisburg. Most of the other universi-
ties that Pitt so optimistically compares
‘itself to already offer benefits, as do a
rising number of businesses, according
to the Human Rights Campaign.

And lastly, what kind of image is
Pitt presenting to its prospective stu-
dents, gay, lesbian or otherwise?
Clearly, Pitt wants these potential stu-
dents to know that they are welcome to
study here, but not to work for Pitt and
receive beneﬁts considered de rigueur
elsewhere. «

The American Civil Liberties
Union, which is representing seven Pitt
employees, current and former, has
already said that it will appeal. For the
sake of Pitt’s workers, and for Pitt,
let’s hope this happens quickly, and
with a more favorable outcome.

Debt nothing to be embarrassed about

I recently had one of those neces-
sary college experiences —— Giant
Eagle declined my credit card because
I had exceeded my limit, While I
scrounged in my backpack to find
change in order to pay for my frozen
strawberries and limes, the checkout
clerk looked at me with a mixture of
pity and boredom. Eventually, I bor-
rowed $10 from a friend, who told me
that he knew how embarrassing the
whole ordeal could be. ‘’

But I wasn’t embarrassed. I don’t
associate not having money "with
shame. I associate shame
and embarrassment with
snarﬁng coffee up my nose,
which I do, every single day,
usually in public and in
front of people cooler and
more attractive than I am. _
Instead, I associate having
no money with ketchup and
ramen spaghetti. Despite my
views, there’s still a stigma
attached to having no
money, and a heavy one at
that.

Being broke in college is some-
thing of a given. When students say
that they’re broke, it elicits sympathy
from all those who have been in the
same situation, especially mid-1ife-cri-
sis candidates who are sill paying off

.student loans.

Take being broke out of this con-
text, and people, rather than offering
pity, assign shame, which is one of the
stupidest things they could do. Why
should people be ashamed of being
poor, whether temporarily or penna-
nently? Something’s clearly wrong
with a society that punishes people for
the simply having less money than they
are apparently supposed to —— and who
designates what we’re supposed to
have anyway?

The J oneses of the phrase, “Keeping up

Sailing through predictions for the upcoming semester

NEWTOWN, Pa. — As a prominent
‘80s metal band so poignantly sang,
“I’m sailing away.”

I’ll be spending the entire spring
semester aboard the S.S. Universe
Explorer, participating in the
Semester At Sea program. For three
months, I’ll traverse the oceans on a
massive cruise ship, exploring the
far reaches of the globe in pursuit of
adventure, enlightenment and the
world’s stiffest drinks. And I will do
it all for college credits — 12 of
them, to be exact.

Does anybody else feel like'I’m
getting away with something ille-
gal? Like academic fraud or extor-
tion?

Of course, my study abroad will
not be without its sacrifices. After
all, missing a season at Pitt is kind
of like missing a whole season of
your favorite reality television
show. And while I’ll certainly long
for the dirty snow and fries from the
“O,” I’m mostly going to miss wit-
nessing the high-class drama bound
to erupt in the coming months: a
beautiful disaster of political scan-
dal, athletics department folly,
administrative smooth-talking,
couch-burning and general shadi-
ness rivaled in shock—value and
entertainment only by the Paris
Hilton sex tape.

From the sunny top deck of a
cruise ship, coasting gently through
the deep blue bosom of the
Caribbean Sea, I’ll raise my glass of
wine to you, Pitt students, and offer
my following predictions for the
spring:

The athletics department, realiz-
ing that losing to Virginia
on national television is
unacceptable, will fire
head coach Walt Harris.
Men’s basketball coach
Jamie Dixon, who, like
Harris, has proven that
experience means noth-
ing, will replace him. ‘

Julius Page, who always looked like
a wide receiver, anyway, when he
caught those alley-oop passes from
Brandin Knight.

The athletics department, in an
effort to increase media coverage of
the basketball team, will feature
“The Oakland Petting
Zoo” in the lobby of the
Pete before every home
game. Along with real
animals,’ it will feature
prominent University
officials in cages. It
won’t smell good. Nor
will it boost ratings the

Brandin Knight, whom I’ve seen on
the sidelines more than once this
season, and who always kind of
looked like a quarterback when he
threw those alley-oop passes to
Julius Page.

Larry Fitzgerald will enter the
NFL draft. Chancellor Nordenberg
will cry like a baby at his feet and
offer him 7 percent of his yearly
salary. Coach Dixon won’t fret,

claims that laboratory primates are

Off the wire: Despite experts, mad cow not real threat

JAMES MOON
Daily Bruin (U. Califomia‘-Los Angeles)

LOS ANGELES — On Dec. 23, 2003, a dark day for cattle farmers
all over the United States, a single Holstein cow from Canada Via
Washington was diagnosed with mad cow disease. The dreaded ail-
ment (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, for South-Campus types)
had arrived in America Mad cow has become the disease of the
moment. And while some would have Americans turn away from red
meat altogether for greener pastures, ﬂue truth is somewhat less dis-
concerting: There is no mad cow scare, only scare tactics.

You can’t turn on the television anymore without an “expert”
telling you about some doomsday scenario involving BSE. Activist
(and vegetarian) Michael Greger has already dubbed BSE the “plague
of the 21st century.” Former cattle rancher (and current vegetarian)
Howard Lyman has compared BSE to AIDS in terms of destructive
potential. Add in some dramatizations of how BSE has a nasty ten-
dency to leave its victim’s brain with spongy-looking holes, and let
mass pamc ensue.

The threat of BSE has been exaggerated to a point where even the
most carnivorous of Americans may begin to. question their Double-
Double—eating ways. And why shouldn’t they? The country is already
acting on fear. Leaders in this crusade, such as Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle, have been up in arms demanding mandatory
BSE testing for every cow killed in the United States (all 35 million of
ﬂrem), no matter how costly or unnecessary it may be.

In the meantime, meat—vending establishments all over the coun-
try are trying to distance themselves from the Washington slaughter-
house for fear of losing business. Even the UCLA dining halls have

‘ posted disclaimers to ease student concerns about its beef.

As hard as it is to believe, all this is the result of one cow. There

is only one case of an actual person diagnosed with variant’

Creutzfeldt—Jakob Disease (the human version of BSE) in the United
States — and that person contracted the disease during her stay in
England. Is it not possible that we might be overreacting just a little?
For example, -ﬂrere have only been 153 VCJD deaths worldwide,
somewhat short of an AIDS—scale epidemic. 0

It’s a sad reﬂection of society that hysterical fears have come’ to
overshadow facts, which clearly speak for themselves. First of all, the
proteins or prions responsible for BSE can be found mainly in the ner-
vous system of cows and cows alone. While it is possible that stray
proteins may ﬁnd their way into your steak in the slaughterhouse, there
is still little reason for concern. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention places the odds of contracting VCJD, even after eating a
contaminated piece of meat, at one in 10 billion. Your chances are bet-
ter for winning the lottery. As the USDA Food Safety Inspection
Service has been saying, there is “virtually zerorisk” of getting mad
oowdiseaseinthe United States. -

It boggles the mind how this “better-saf —than-sorry’ ’ attitude for
a non—problem has spread so quickly. Regulations, such as the pro-
posed testing of all cows for BSE, may make you feel better about the
non-threat, but they come at a cost. And countries like Japan and South
Korea are refusing American beef exports, further hurting the $40 bil-
lion  How far will this madness continue in order to placate
unfounded fears? ,

We’re a country full of Atkins dieters and Big Mac-eaters. Most
of the people warning of the proposed dangers of red meat are more
interested in preaching the wonders of a beeﬂess lifestyle. Moral, eth-
ical and health issues aside, the future of beef consumption in ﬂre
United States should not be complicated by scare tactics. When it
comes down to it, as the secretary of agriculture has said: “Beef is
absolutely safe to eat.”

Torque not so cool, even with Ice Cube

Torque

Starring: Martin Henderson,
Monet Mazur, Jaime Pressly,
Jay Hernandez, Adam Scott, Ice
Cube, Matt Schultze

Directed by: Joseph Kahn '

vﬁ .

Motorcycle chases, lots of ﬁre, gun
ﬁghts, brawls that ' spill out into the
streets, good-looking men and women

doing motorcycle tricks —— it sounds_

like a good time. However, “Torque”
takes this potentially fun combination
and turns it into a disastrously boring
and outlandish movie.

The script seems like the comic
book-infused motorcycle fantasies of a
1.2—year-old boy who’s been listening to
a lot of 50 Cent. It’_s.ﬂashy and action-
packed, with plenty of swearing, but it
doesn’t make much sense. Basically,
Ford (Martin Henderson) just ﬁnished a
six-month sentence in jail, but he has
plenty of trouble to deal with on the
outside. The leader of the Hellions
motorcycle gang, Henry (Matt
Schulze), is seeking to exact revenge on
Ford for some motorcycles that Ford
stole. Henry sets Ford up, and suddenly
the leader of another motorcycle gang,
Trey (Ice Cube), is after Ford, as are a
pair of FBI agents. Ford and his friends
ride their motorcycles across

California, trying to clear Ford’s name.

There are many opportunities for
comedy and for suspense, but the
chances are missed or just executed
poorly. There are only a couple
moments of humor in an otherwise dull
ﬁlm that tries too hard with its one—lin-
ers. The characters lack any interesting
or unique qualities. They can be classi-
ﬁed into typical categories - the bad boy
who is really good, the tough but beau-
tiful woman, the bumbling sidekicks,
the really evil bad guy and the big—city
cop who’s stuck in the country. It’s all
been done before. Even the chemistry
between the characters is hard to
believe. They might as well be com-
plete strangers to each other caught up
in a twisted version of “The Real

sWorld.”

The motorcycles are loud, but the
movie lacks an up—tempo soundtrack to
drive the action and distract from the
improbability of the motorcycle stunts.
Violence occurs quite frequently in the
movie without much consequence,
unless the person is meant to be killed.
People walk out of a ﬁery explosion
unscathed. Most of the brawls seem
unprovoked, making the frequent use of
switchblades even more ridiculous. The
motorcycle gangs seem obsessed with
inventing trouble. ’ ‘

Director Joseph Kahn makes his
feature-ﬁlm debut with “Torque,” hav-

ing dabbled only in music videos
before. The tight shots he frequently
uses are great for Britney Spears’ face,
but slightly annoying in this context.
The rapid-moving backgrounds used to
accentuate the speed of the motorcycles
are motion-sickness-inducing and dis-
tract from the action of the scene. Some
of the speed scenesare exciting without
all of the special-effect extras, though,
such as a race car pushing 140 miles per
hour down a highway with two motor-
cycles ﬂanking it on both sides.

This bloodless action film fails
because it cannot even rely on action to
keep the audience interested. “Torque”

‘falls short of the director’s goal to be

the next great motorcycle chase movie.

Although it doesn’t lack motorcycle

chases or violence, nothing in the
movie makes the story memorable. This
silly ﬁlm only serves to give motorcy-
cle gangs a worse name.

“Torque” opens in theaters Friday.

Out of Eden is so lovely

Love, Peace and Happiness
Out of Eden

Gotee Records
sfnfnfr

Mix together a little pop, some”R&B,
a pinch of hip-hop, plenty of dance
beats, as well as a bit of spirituality, and
you’ve got the upbeat new album from
girl group Out of Eden, Love, Peace and
Happiness. This three-member gospel
group has shared the stage with music
stars such as Kirk Franklin and Destiny’s
Child, and it’s easy to understand why.
Their talent shines through in each of the
songs on their fifth CD.

There are plenty of fun and upbeat
tracks on the album and a definite sense
of girl power without the British accents
or risque outfits. The high energy of the
first song sets the pace for the rest of the
record. It’s hard to keep still while lis-

tening to each of the songs, from the
most light-hearted to the more serious
subjects. The music is a strong, eclectic
mix of pop, techno and R&B inﬂuences.
The trio has three great voices that blend
well with each other and the accompany-
ing music. The pounding percussion in
the background keeps the songs on the
CD jumping. .

Out of Eden tackles a variety of sub-
jects on its 1.2-track CD. The party-ready
song V“Soldiers” invites everyone to
come together for God and also to have
fun. Right after, the momentum slows a
bit with “Shoulda Listened,” a song
about regrets. The songs fit well togeth-
er, and the CD moves along at a steady
pace. Each song is about a. different
aspect of being young in the new millen-
nium, with a Christian slant: However,
the lyrics are easy to relate to, religious

The greatest installment of the

ed bachelor party scene that the stu-
dio made the buying focal point,
“American Wedding” is a quality
DVD for any collection.

“American Wedding” is the

highlight film for the character

Steve Stiﬂer (Seann William Scott).

The DVD keeps this idea going as '

one of the special features in a seg-

ment titled “Stiﬂer Speak.” In this A

feature, Adam Herz, the writer of all
three “Pie” films, talks about how he
created the Stiﬂer character and how
easy it is to talk like him.

In the segment" are series of takes
in which Stiﬂer spouts off at the
mouth.with obscenities that would
make a sailor blush. And after
wat_ching the segment, any admirer
of Stiﬂer can proceed to make up his
or her own Stiﬂer Speak and use it
like it’s going out of style, _

well together — a reason that it was
removed from theaters.

The bachelor party scene is just
a small piece of the pie for this
DVD, since the outtakes, deleted
scenes and ‘special behind-the-
scenes footage make this DVD
Worth buying.

THE PITT NEWS

~13

I have a proposal for all you males
out there. It’s a simple request, but I’ll
need your cooperation for it to work. I
think the University of Pittsburgh’s
campus needs to have its own “Naked
Cowboy.” Yeah, it’s cold out there —
really cold —- but prove your manliness

I to Oak1and’s women by stripping down

to your tighty—whities — I’ll be nice
and let you wear a scarf ——- to gain the
recognition and the admiration of
Pittsburgh’s most worthy women.

Before my proposal, however, here
is a brief history for those of you who
are unaware of who the Naked Cowboy
is and what he stands for.

NC’s real name is Robert Burck,
and he is a man who loves ‘the spotlight
and isn’t afraid to do what may be
thought of as shocking to some for the
attention he well deserves. After-all, any
man able to wear nothing but a tiny
piece of cloth in a blizzard is worthy of
a picture or two. .

As mentioned on his Web site, th
idea came to him on May 5, 1998, when
the Naked Cowboy went out to New
York City and showed up at the Ed
Sullivan Theater in hopes that David
Letterman’s camera crew would get a
shot of him and launch his stardom. He
didn’t exactly find the reaction he was
looking for when security asked him to
put some pants on and leave. Burck
wanted to become the “most celebrated

entertainer of all
time.” Years have
passed, and needless to
say, Burck is not get-
ting asked to cover up
his whites. T

Why the need for a
naked cowboy, you
ask‘? A visit to New
York City over
winter break .
gave me the idea
to call upon you
boys out there.
Perhaps it’s
because the

pletely unintentional, of

Oakland, I’m
in love. I think
I truly found

with. Think

NC has been miserable
for me. I miss him. I believe we had a
connection and told the cameraman ——
my brother — about my feelings that

were rapidly developing over the last
‘month. My brother thought I had gone

half mad. I just knew that Iwanted my
own Naked Cowboy very much.

To a passerby watching the situa-
tion, perhaps I did appear a little odd.
Maybe a person would have thought so
because of the way I shoved myself to
the front of the crowd, knocking over
the younger girls that were standing
before this god with their hands
clutched to their prepubescent chests.
Or perhaps it was because I made him

like she’s in a car speed-_
ing over bumps‘? I am in

love with a man I don’t even know,

except that he likes to wear barely-there
underwear in front of thousands of
strangers and pose for ﬂashing cameras
held by brothers such as mine for a girl
such as myself in his cowboy boots.
After realizing I had just put my
hands on the Big App1e’s icon, I found
myself contemplating many questions.
For instance, does, NC get cold, and
how does that work out for a certain
area? Do his underwear cut off circula-
tion, perhaps putting blood ﬂow down
there in jeopardy? But as En Vogue
says, “What a man.” He sacriﬁces quite
a bit to bare it all. What he needs is a
nice cowgirl to come home to who will

The love for a brave man who wears his whitey-tighties in blizzards

make him a warm bath and cook a pip-
ing—hot dinner to heat him up.

I would love to be NC’s cowgirl,
much like a muse in a Shakespearean
play. Moving on to the reason for my
suggestion to have a naked cowboy on
campus — spring is ahead and
romances will be in bloom. Who better
to be your valentine than your very own
singing Naked Cowboy?

First, you need a name. The Naked
Cowboy is great, but there is a copy-
right law out there against anyone “bor-
rowing” his name. We don’t need to see
Oakland cops arresting some poor guy
in briefs on his first day.

Second, you need not be afraid of
showing some skin to the bundled up
Pittsburghers,and get naked. Or at least
close to it. We also don’t want our eye
candy to get arrested for indecent expo-
sure. Instead, why not go with under-
wear, Naked.Cowboy style, but with the
markings of blue and gold. Get some
school pride.

Lastly, you need a gimmick. You’re
a college student. Get creative.

While I would love to see my very
own Naked Cowboy, trust me, I believe
his exact words were “Bye, sweet-
heart,” as I departed Times Square, I

know the chances are slim, but in the .

weeks ahead, I will peek my head out
my apartment window, hoping for a
glimpse of a guy in briefs.

Panthers drop three of four meets

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

Despite four consecutive victories by
freshman Matt Kocher, the Pitt wrestling
team managed to garner only one  in
four dual matches over the weekend. The
Panthers shut out Gardner-Webb, yet lost

to Penn State, Central Michigan, and

Indiana.

“We’re pretty young,” head coach
Rande‘ Stottlemyer said; ,“We start a lot of
freshmen and red-shirt sophomores. The

} big thing is that we all  to the end of
i the year and we just want ‘to get better,

and some guys did, but we still have a
ways to go.”

1 Penn State 28, Pitt 15

Three early victories by the Nittany
Lions, including pins by Pat Curnmins
and Josh Moore at heavyweight and 133
pounds, respectively, spurred the team to
a 28-15 win over Pitt.

Despite victories by Kocher, sopho-
more Ronald Tarquinio, junior Zachariah
Doll and sophomore Francis Iorﬁdo, the
Panthers lost a very competitive match
before 2,172 at the Petersen Events
Center ‘on Friday night. - .

“It was a great atmosphere and it was
great ‘to see all the crowd here,”

Stottlemyer said. “We would have liked
to see -a better outcome, but we wrestled
hard and that was about all we could do.”

After Penn State’s three early wins,
Pitt found itself down 15-0. However,
Tarquinio’s 5-3 victory at 141 pounds

‘over DeVV1tt Driscoll swung momentum

for the home team as the Panthers
attempted to mount arcomeback by win-
ning’t‘hree of the next four bouts.

“That hurt big—time. We really need-
ed to win one of those ﬁrst few [bouts],”
Stottlemyer said. “Tarquinio did a great
job getting his match at the end and
Kocher winning in overtime gave us a
chance and put us back in the [match].”

Penn State closed the match with
major decision wins by Eric Bradley and
Joel Edwards at 184 and 197 pounds,
respectively. While losing to the Nittany
Lions certainly wasn’t what Pitt was hop-
ing for, Iorﬁdo spoke positively about the
feisty nature of this year’s team.

“We have a resilient bunch of guys,
and we fought hard,” Iorﬁdo said. “[But]
things just didn’tturn out quite as well a
we would have liked.” »
Pitt 52, Gardner-Webb 0

In its ﬁrst match of the 15th Annual
Wendy’s Big Classic Duals at Ashland
University on Sunday, the Panthers

scored 52 points in shutting out Gardner-
Webb, the most a Pitt team has scored
since scoring 53 against Franklin and
Marshall during the 1996-1997 season.

“[Gardner-Webb] just turned
Division I a few years back,” Stottlemyer
said. “So that was a pretty"easy match
because they have a long way to go.”

For Pitt, freshmen Drew Headlee,
Kocher, Eric Cassidy and sophomore
Justin Nestor recorded pins while
Tarquinio and senior Travis Shirley were
awarded forfeit wins at 141 pounds and
heavyweight, respectively.

Also scoring for the Panthers were
Iorﬁdo at 174 pounds, freshman Keith
Gavin at 165 pounds, senior Josh Birt at
197 pounds and junior Tyshawn Scarlett
at 133 pounds.

Central Michigan 31, Pitt 3

In what was a striking role reversal, '

Pitt was nearly shut out by the Chippewas
of Central Michigan in the second match
of the day. The lone Panther victory came
from Kocher, a 6-4 decision at 149
pounds.

“I’d have to look at the books, but we
must have lost probably ﬁve one—point
matches,” Stottlemyer said. “So we were

Wrestling, page 19

Basketball’s
overtime is the
greatest by far
View

    

Over the last few days, my two _

favorite basketball teams have competed
in games featuring dramatic overtime ﬁn-
ishes. .

On Saturday, Pitt survived not one,
but two potentially backbreaking circus
shots from  freshman Guillermo
Diaz to ﬁnish off the Hurricanes in double
overtime and extend the nation’s longest
winning streak.

The outcome was not so joyous for
my beloved New York Knicks on Monday
at Madison Square Garden, however.
After Stephon Marbury hit three free
throws and Penny Hardaway stole the
inbounds pass, Allan Houston drained a
garne—tying tlrree-pointer with six seconds
left to go _in regulation. The Knicks had
come back from 20 points» down and
forced overtime only to drop the game to
the Dallas Mavericks, 127-121. _

Both of these games proved yet again
that overtime basketball is the most excit-
ing extra-time format in sports. The natur-
al dramatic tension captured in a last-sec-
ond shot is unmatched, and the short over-
time periods and quick‘ possession
changes force teams to continue to try to
make plays, rather than playing for a tie, as
in regular-season hockey, or for a ﬁeld
goal, as in regular-season football.

One need not look any further than A
the extra—time formats of basketball’s con-
temporaries to see why the NBA and col-
lege basketballhave things so very right
when it comes to overtime.

Any sport with the potential for a tie
is automatically eliminated from con-
tention for best overtime format. Draws
are boring;_ they automatically eliminate
the feelings of unabashed joy and heart-
break that result from a win/loss resolu-
tion, and anyone who watched the
Steelers-Falcons game in 2002 knows that
they leave a brooding sense of confusion
and disappointment in the air for all panies
involved. This gets rid of NFL football,

Panther womenpick up a handful of firsts at Kent State

RAYMOND NEWBY
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s"
» indoor track and field teams com-

peted in Kent State’s Black Squirrel
Classic this past weekend. Members
of the women’s team placed first in
nine different events and finished in
the top five 31 times. The men’s
team had one first-place finish and
15 members who placed in the top
five.

Women 4

Trenace Elliot finished in first
place three times during the two-
day event. She finished with times
of -25.04 seconds in the ,200—meter
dash and 55.83 seconds in the 400,
as well as being part of the distance
medley team that finished in 12
minutes, 4.59 seconds.

“I’m really happy with the way
her training has come along,” said

head coach Alonzo Webb. “She’s a,
 [and] she ran

tough competitor
really well this weekend.”

Janine Jones, a member of the
distance medley team, also helped
the 4x400meter relay team finish
first with a time of 3:53.23.

Other first place finishers for
in the track events were
McCandless ,with a

pair of first-place finishes for the
Panthers in the field events, placing
ahead of all her competitors in the
long jump and the triple jump, with
distances of 5.61 meters and 12.80
meters, respectively.

Amanda Walker also finished
first in a field event, recording a
distance of 14.76 meters in the shot
put.

Men

The men’s distance medley team
took home the only first-place fin-
ish for the Panthers, finishing with
a time of 10:05.00, nearly five sec-

onds ahead of the second—place
team from ‘host Kent State.

Jeryl Wilborn and Troy
Roberson, members of the distance
medley team, were also part of the
4x400 team that placed a close sec-
ond with a time of 3:16.55.

Andrew Zang and Justin
Clickett were the only other
Panthers to finish as runners-up.
Zang’s time of 1:23.41 in the 600-
meter, run and Clickett’s personal
best distance of 16.38 meters in the
shot put were good enough for sec-
ond place.

“I think, overall, they per-

formed fairly well,” said Webb.
“They’ve been off for a month 
and had only three days of practice
[since they’ve been back]. But I
think we’re slightly ahead of where
we were last year.”

The Panthers will be in action
next at the Red Simmons Invite in
Ann Arbor, Mich., on Jan 24, where
Webb feels both teams will continue
to perform better.

“We have a hard two weeks of
training before the next meet,” he
said “And after that [at Penn State],
we’ll be able to tell where our team
really is.”

Jaron Brown brings the ball down court during the Panthers’ 74-71 win over

Notre Dame on Monday night.

Brown deserves recognition

positive,” said Virginia Tech head coach
Seth Greenberg after the two teams played
earlier this season. “I-Ieis able to get to the
middle of the ﬂoor . .. make plays P and
cause tumovers.”

What makes Brown so good?

First off, it’s his versatility that allows
him play just about any position on the
ﬂoor.

Originally recruited as a point guard,
Brown was a backup to Brandin Knight
his first season at Pitt. At some points this
year, Brown has successfully run the point
when needed I

For the past three seasons, the

Panthers have used Brown in the No. 3

‘position on the" ﬂoor, which means he

sometimes plays as a small forward and
sometimes as a third guard. His 6-foot, 4-
inch, 229-pound frame allows him to bang
bodies inside, but he is also agile enough
to keep smaller players on their heels.-

“He can post-up; he can handle the
ball; he even guarded me at times,”
Thomas said. “He’s a huge key for them.”

His versatility extends to the stat sheet
as well. Brown is in the top three on the
team in scoring, rebounds, assists and
steals, and also does a number of things
that don’t show up in a box score.

Against Notre Dame, Brown helped
keep Pitt in the game, posting—up down

‘low andﬁghting for loose balls to keep

possessions alive. _

“He’s an older, more experienced
guy, and he made some big, big plays,”
Brey said. “He’s a power forward playing
at the three. He’s most dangerous when
the shot goes up.” /

But if Brown is such an important
part of the team, how is he able to go
unnoticed despite so much success?

Perhaps because Brown, who gradu-
ated last year and is pursuing another
degree in legal studies, is one of the qui-
etest basketball players you will ever see
on a court.

“He is not a ﬂashy player like Page or

Krauser,” Greenberg said.

Whether it be on the court or off the

court, Brown quietly goes about his busi-
ness and gets the job done.
g ‘Tm glad I’m not an opposing coach
to him,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said.
“He seems to do everything right on and
off the court and is such a great example
of a great student athlete.”

If only they all could be like that. « =*

Panthers fail to

just banging the door so close and so
hard, but we just couldn’t get it done.

“Matt [Kocher] wrestles real hard.
We love the kid. He goes hard‘ all the
time. It doesn’t matter [whether he’s] up
by ﬁve or down by ﬁve,” Stottlemyer
added.

-Indiana 19, Pitt 13

In the ﬁnal match of the day, Pitt lost 

a by .a narrow margin to Indiana, as the
Hoosiers used victories in the ﬁnal two
weight classes to collect the win.

“We didn’t wrestle particularly
well,” Stottlemyer said.

, For the Panthers, Scarlett, Kocher,
Nestor and junior Mike Croyle recorded
wins at 133 pounds, 149 pounds, 157
-pounds, and 184 pounds, respectively.
After eight bouts, the match was tied at
13 apiece, yet Pitt failed to capitalize dur-
ing the ﬁnal two matches and dropped to
3-4 for the 2003-2004 campaign.

. The Panthers’ next match is at
Fitzgerald Field House on Saturday,
January 17th at 7 p.m. against cross-town
rival Duquesne.

Who needs extra innings when you have extra basketball?

Cunningham, page 15

regular-season NHL hockey and regular-
season professional soccer right off the
bat.

Playoff hockey and football both have
sudden-death scoring formats, and each
league faces serious problems with its
respective format. The NFL decides pos-
session on a coin ﬂip, and all toooften, the
team that randomly wins possession wins
the game, without ﬂue other team getting a
chance to score. _

The constant ebb—and-ﬂow of a hock-
ey game eliminates the NHL from having
the same possession problem that the NFL
does. The problem in ‘playoff hockey is
attrition. These guys play full 20-minute
overtime periods, with full intermissions
between each period. Fear of losing usual-
ly causes teams to sit on the puck in over-
time, and by the time someone ﬁnally

whips the puck past -the goalie for the.

game winner, both teams look more wind-
ed than Dom DeLuise and Louie
Anderson in a three-legged race.
Ultimately, mostof the late overtime goals
in hockey are results of goaltenders being
exhausted rather than skillful shooting.
Both of these games could easily ben-
eﬁt from imitating basketball’s overtime
format. The NFL“would be better served to
play a seVen—and-a—half-minute quarter,

with the leader at the end of the quarter the

winner. This would nearly ensure that each

team gets an offensive possession, and it
wo11ld encourage teams to play for the end
zone rather than settle for a ﬁeld goal,
making the game more exciting to watch.
The NHL has the right idea by letting
the game continue until there is a winner,

but it needs to scale things down a bit

Gary Bettman, if you’re listening, here are
a few tips: ﬁrst, cut the playoff overtime
periods down ﬁom 20 minutes to the reg-
ular season standard of ﬁve. Then, get rid
of those horrible intermissions that kept
me up until 3 am. back in 2000 when I
should have been studying for that
Advanced Placement European History
exam. Finally, scrap the sudden-death for-
mat If a team scores, ﬁnish out the period
until one team, has more goals than the
other when the clock hits zero.

And then there is baseball. Slow, stub-
born, antiquated baseball. Baseball has
extra innings; play until the home team has
its last at—bat. A problem with this system
is that it gives too much of an advantage to
the home team. But the larger problem for
extra-inning baseball is that baseball is a

' game that refuses to put a time limit on

itself.

Baseball remains in limbo somewhere
between the stupidity of sudden death and
the complete lack of a clock. The constant
plate posturing and match-up pitching
changes in extra-inning baseball are excru-
ciatingly painful to watch, but a time limit
is impossible without the possibility of a

tie. . .
What baseball should do, in the case
of nine completed innings, is put a 30-
minute time limit on the game. This way,
batters will step up to the plate and,
gasssssp, bat instead of adjusting their bat-
ting gloves and scratching their crotches
for ﬁve minutes each. And managers will
have to be much savvier with their pitch-
ing moves. If no one has scored at the end

of thirty minutes, baseball should. follow ”

the example of the late—round World Cup
shootout.

Since all that Major League Baseball
wishes to promote in the ﬁrst place is the
long ball, it should decide its games with a
home-rim derby contest. Each team brings
its ﬁve biggest guns to the plate, each of
whom takes pitches from his respective
batting practice coach. Ten strikes each;
team with the most homers wins. This, of
course, is a horrible way to decide any atl1—
letic contest, but then again, any sport in
which John Kruk can lead the league in a
major offensive statistical category can’t
really be called an athletic contest, can it?

So, I take my hat off tdbasketball for
its overtime format, and I look forward to
many future game-tying shots, profanity-
laden tirades and shouts of jubilation as the
clock ticks down.

Miehael Cunningham is a senior staﬁ"
writer for The Pitt News, and he still hates
Reggie Miller for, well, the entire mid— ‘90s.
