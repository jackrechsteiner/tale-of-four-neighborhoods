Drinking fines upset

When Danielle Key woke up. in a bed
at UPMC Presbyterian, she was scared,
alone, covered in her own vomit and there
was a yellow citation next to her head.

Key, a freshman, is like many other Pitt

students hospitalized for drinking too‘ D
much. .
' _ “I cried,” Key said about waking up in S
‘ the hospital. “I was really scared. I knew

what was happening, but it was still too
much, too fast” . —

Key had been‘ at a party the night
before and drank until she lost conscious-
ness. Then someone must havecalled 911,
according to Key, because somehow she
ended up in a Presby bed alone, scared and

THE PITT NEWS

Reporters struggle with objectivity
vs. sensationalism, AP journalist says

KATE LAUGHLIN
Staff Writer

No matter how objective a reporter
strives to be, the process of deciding just

what is news and what isn’t is an inher-'

ently subjective one.

“Reporters are human beings who
constantly struggle with this,”
Associated Press reporter Beth J. Harpaz
told a group of students and faculty gath-
ered on the fifth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning Tuesday. Harpaz is the author
of the critically acclaimed book, “The
Girls in the Van: Covering Hillary,”
which details former first lady Hillary
Clinton’s lengthy and grueling 2000
New York state senatorial campaign.
Harpaz details the campaign distinctly
from the perspective of a member of the
traveling press corps, expected to churn
out article after article every time that
Clinton went to the bathroom or swatted
a ﬂy.

Harpaz talked candidly about the
political realities of campaigning and the
candidates’ perpetual sale of themselves
and every aspect of their deliberately cre-
ated images. In addition to campaign
talk, Harpaz raised issues about the

“media beast” of which, for better or
worse, she is a part.

“One reason I decided to write this
book was to let the public see the process
when we have to decide what the news is
and what the lead is,” Harpaz said. “The
ﬁnal product is not necessarily the only
way to see things.”

Harpaz described a time when she
struggled with whether to lead a story
with a verbal blunder that Hillary had
committed. In a forum on gun control,
Hillary referred to a student who had
been shot as a murder victim, though in
reality he was very much alive and lis-
tening to her from the front row.

Torn between what could be con-
strued as sensationalizing a mistake and
reporting a blunder that Harpaz per-
ceived to be symptomatic of a larger
problem, she decided under the looming
pressure of deadlines to lead with the
blunder. V ,

“Part of how I justify this in my own
mind is that I think I write about it when
it is symbolic of something else,” she
_explained. "‘In this case it was that at this
earlystage in Hillary’s campaign, they
were not as ready and polished to run a

senatorial campaign as they should have

been. It was unclear if her advisers had
briefed her on the situation or not. It was
also either lead with that or with ‘Hillary
supports gun control’ which everybody
already knew and wasn’t really news.”

Harpaz gave her own defense of
what the general public often perceives
as the “evil media” who goes overboard
for scandal.

“We take the responsibility very seri-
ously that our forefathers — and mothers
——-_ gave us in the First Amendment, and
that is to be a watchdog on power and to
report everything that we see.” .

Harpaz also discussed ways that

women’s involvement in politics and the ‘

media has altered both systems.

For example, she said that 40 years
ago, things such as. breast cancer and
infant care would probably not be public
issues.

Pitt senior Tanya Sepela attended .

Harpaz’s talk mainly out of interest in
hearing about Clinton.

“I was pleasantly surprised that
everything else Harpaz talked about was
extremely interesting, too,” she said.
“She raised a lot of issues about what it
means to be part of the media and the
responsibilities that come with it.”

But Key did not go ‘through any pro-
grams. She did not even know that judicial

offense until she read it in The Pitt News’ ’

Key, who is awaiting a hearing, said
that the lack of rehabilitation efforts might

be because the offense occurred off .

owned building like a fratemity house. ~

« often the ﬁrst vehicles to the scene of an

makes a determination about whether the
student needs emergency care and calls for
a city medical vehicle if there is.

apology wasn’t worth the $800 hospital

to pay for safety. He said that with the cur-
rent system, at least he can be conﬁdent that

PERSPECTIVES

EDITORIAL

WVU should lift protest bans

lrnagine if the federal government sud-
denly decided ‘there would be no more
protests on Capitol Hill. Imagine if Pitt
declared the Cathedral of Learning and sur-
rotmding areas a protest-ﬂee zone.

Ridiculous, you’d say. A violation of
the Constitution and your right to ﬂee
speech, you’d say. , _

The situation wouldn’t be too hard to
imagine if you were a West Virginia
University student + the university has two
designated protest zones on its main cam-
pus. As for the rest of campus, no exercise of
ﬂee speech allowed.

So much for civil disobedience, acade-
mic ﬂeedom and the Constitution.

The designation of ﬂee speech zones at
WVU occurred in the ‘60s, the era of violent
and disorderly Vietnam protests, and has
remained on ﬂie books since. Controversy
surrounding the ﬂee speech zones surfaced
in 1996 when a faculty group rediscovered
the restrictions. In ﬂie years since, twice stu-
dent protesters were removed ﬂom areas
outside the designated zones.

On Feb. 12, protesters gathered to
demonstrate against the ﬂee speech zones.
In explaining their position to the Post-
Gazette, they explained that they were out to
prove that ﬂee speech could exist without
violence.

It’s sad that WVU protesters would
even have to make such an argument.
Certainly, there shouldn’t be a need to
explain the purposes and beneﬁts of ﬂee
speech to university administrators. Any

constitutional law professor, or political sci-
ence major for that matter, can explain to
them the purposes of having the right to ﬂee
speech and mass demonstration.

After students and faculty banded
together to form The West Virginia
University Free Speech Consortium,’ the
university agreed to form a committee to
study the issue. But, as we all know, the for-
mation of a university committee means lit-
tle. Here at Pitt, a University Committee was
formed- in lune to study the issue of same-
sex beneﬁts. The committee hit the six
month mark in December with nothing to
show fdr itself.

The formation of the committee itself

sends a conciliatory message, butone has to
wonder what the big deal is. Free speech is
protected by the Constitution, and not limit-
ed by geography.

Furthermore, WVU administrators
must see that it is in their best interest to
remove the protest zone restrictions ﬂom the
books. College campuses are supposed to be
havens for academic ﬂeedorn and political
discussion. What kind" ‘of message is WVU
sending to the public by limiting ﬂee
speech, inhibiting public discourse and pre-
venting people ﬂom being seen and heard?

The situation leaves aperson wonder-
ing: did WVU administrators never protest
in their college years? Didn’t they believe
they had a right to be seen and heard? If this
were the federal govemment, would admin-
istrators accept a protest ban on Capitol
Hill?

The Evil Axis and the

i As for Iraq, any
Desert Storm veteran suf-
fering from Persian Gulf
Syndrome can tell you

_why Saddam Hussein’s
regime should be erased
from the planet.

While there is no

, doubt that these states are

_ a threat to national secu-
rity, the “Axis of Evil”
speech transmitted the’

 

Union address, President .
Bush placed Iran, Iraq and North
Korea in one class, labeling them an
“Axis of, Evil” whgse pursuit of
weapons of ma_ss_destruction make
them dangerous to the security of the
entire world. A

The problem withithis label --
which is a curious mixed metaphor
referencing both the Axis powers in
World War II_ and Ronald Reagan’s
famous designation of the Soviet
Union as the “Evil Empire” ——,is that
it is something Bush should have
kept to himself. . -

This isn’t to say that these coun-

tries are not a threat to global securi-
ty. .
Iran is listed by the State
Department as the world’s most
active terrorist-sponsoring state, a
distinction that was recently rein’-
forced by the capture of an Iranian
weapons-filled cargoship that was
destined for Yasser Arafat’s Palestine
Authority.

North Korea has been long sus-

wrong messages at a time
when public perception and public
relations are critical.

Though the allusion to the axis
powers is a powerful one, Iran, Iraq
and Korea are not Germany, Italy
and Japan. Nor are they even allies.

Iran and Iraq have fought numer-
ous wars against each other, and
North Korea, under the leadership of
reclusive President Kim Il Sung, is
far too isolationist to form alliances
with countries as geographically and
ideologically distant as are those in
the Middle East. j . ‘I
’ More importantly,’ the three
“Axis of Evil” states are not analo-
gous to Afghanistan. Even before
Sept. 11, ‘Afghanistan had almost no
allies. After Sept. 11, when
America’s sleeping military giant
was suddenly and rudely awakened,
there were no countries other than
Afghanistan whose interests were
directly threatened by the military

What happened to all the real protestors?

If I were President Bush, I’d be
pretty pissed off. He came all the way
from Washington to speak in
Pittsburgh. He even called us
“Knowledge Town.”

But we really let him
down. The protestors at
this year’s presidential
speech were some of the
worst ever. They were a
hodgepodge. of lackluster
idealists and poorly repre-
sented the rebellious spirit

 

zel logic” really bit the big one.

My favorite group was the one
that protested the prohibition of hemp_
in foods. Wow, here’s a cause that
needs a voice. Their point was that if
Bush’s new’ drug policy"
goes through, they will
have to eat pot-less cook-
ies, weed-free nachos
and granola bars absent
of Mary Jane. What will
food producers do? You
just can’t make granola

of the “University of bars without THC!Think
Knowledge Town”. Sure, DaVidMcCa1-thy of all the money it will
the-y stomped around and Columnist take to redo the Quaker

yelled, but few of them

Oats logo. Mr. Quaker

packed any real punch.

Every year, the Union of Angry
Protesters sends representatives to
rage against the machine, but this
year all the good sign-wavers must
have been on vacation. What we got
were some half-ass idiots with
propane cans. Many of them seemed
so excited to be at a “real protest”-
that they forgot why they were there.
They even took the time to explain to
the press that they were “fightin’ the
power” until someone came over to
remind them that they were on a
media strike.

Come on people, if you’re gonna
protest, do it right.

First off, what was up’ with the
pretzel people? I’m sure it must have

sounded real clever in the five min-.

utes after the president.passed out,
but unless you were looking to
impress a string of third graders, why
do it now? Just because you have a
bunch of leftover snacks from that
Steelers Super Bowl party that never
happened doesn’t mean you have to
throw them around like a jackass.
The best part is when you can’t
even give your real names. Folks like
“Etta Cetera” sang oh-so-clever
songs with “pretzel” in the lyrics, but
where’s the cause? What exactly are
you protesting? Choking? Your “pret-

can’t sport his 6-foot
bong anymore and they’ll have to
rename “Uncle Smoky’s Ganja-
Snacks”. Why do I have a feeling that
this protest came about after the fol-
lowing conversation took place:

Rufus (as “Half Baked” plays in .

background): “Hey, Pedro, I like,

. totally hear that Bush is so against

our hash brownies.”
Pedro: “Most heinous!”

Rufus: “Totally! I hear that we ‘

won’t even be able to buy our food
from the ad in the back of High Times
anymore! This sucks, dude!”

Pedro: “We should like totally
protest, man! That’s so what Lennon
would do!” . ' .

My guess is that if you’re in the‘
neighborhood, Cheech, you won’t be
publicizing the “secret ingredients”
in your food anyway. What were you
expecting the president to do? Jump
out of his car and smoke a bowl with
you guys? Sorry, Clinton isn’t in
office anymore. I

At least the trusty’ “War , in
Afghanistan” protesters were there.
They almost resembled an organized
1970s protest. The problem is most

people are in favor of the soldiers in .

Afghanistan. Waving a sign that reads
“war = bad” doesn’t really tell any-
one why you’re not. Nobody likes

death, but American does need to
respond to terrorism. We probably
should have done it much earlier, but
we can’t exactly jump in the Way
Back machine and fix that.

A Perhaps presenting the president
with an alternative to the Middle East
conﬂict would do some good. But
peace isn’t an option right now. We
can’t exactly just mail Osama a big

teddy bear and then go o_ut to Dairy‘

Queen "for soft serve. These people
hate us and they wanteveryone —
including you —— dead. ‘ ”
Protesting! things on college cam-
puses used to be, part of a genera-
tion’s duties. Last, week’s showing
proved that —— like the guitar solo -
it died in the late ‘70s. Protests used
to get things done and raise aware-
ness in. the public eye. Today, most
are ignored because their antics make

them look like the work of extrem-
ists. Some seem like just plain
morons. We already have plenty of
morons, and frankly, they do it better
than you. If you have something to
say, go about saying it in the right
fashion.

A letter to your local congress-
men or newspaper will receive more
scrutiny than sloppy a poster board.
That way people other than angry
secret service agents might actually
listen to you. .

Dave McCarthy promises to take a
break from political pieces for a
while and get back to silly topics like
the new Britney.Spears movie as soon
as possible. E-mail him at mccarthy-

tions of scenes, you think they had to

efforts. It was for this reason that the
other countries of the world made the
invaluable contribution of basically
staying out of our way.

This won’t be the case should we
attack any of the new “Axis” states.
Both North Korea and Iraq have
powerful allies — China and Russia,
respectively — that have already
warned the United States about
expanding the war on terrorism to
tﬂese countries. And even our allies
i .. . .NATO. . ,. ..inc1udi.n.g .  France,

Germany and Great Britain, have
denounced Bush’s “Axis” speech as
dangerous policy.

As for Iran, Bush’s declaration
has caused a major setback in the
slow detente developing between
Washington and Tehran. Since the
1997 election of moderate Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, there
has been a gradual shift of opinion
away from the anti-Americanism that
has existed since the 1979 Islamic
revolution. Sept. 11 hastened this
process.

' Now, Iranians are again holding
anti-American rallies and Iranian
generals are publicly discussing
plans of destroying oil fields — both
in Iran in nearby states —— should the
United States attack. They aren’t

doing this simply because they’re.
insulted. Iran has seen what hap-

pened to Afghanistan and they are
now afraid enough to do something
desperate. .

The success in Afghanistan
showed both the importance of

multinational cooperation and the

us, alienates U.S. allies

dangers faced by a country without
any allies left. I ‘ V

Now, with Bush’s declaration,
the good‘ will toward America‘ that
was generated" by Sept. 11 has evap-
orated. In a time when international
support is needed‘ most, Bush has
made aiunilateral stand and America
is again left standing alone.

M. Derek Care wonders if Florida
could be added to the Axis of Evil
list. He can be reached at derek-

JEREMY JESTER
Staff Writer

The city of Pittsburgh is synonymous
with blue-collar workers and the 2001-02
mer1’_s basketball team is slowly addingthe

‘ color of goldto the_ standard work ethic.

Write off the dainty “recruit to shoot”
mindset. Ben Howland’s coaching philoso-
phy is more along the lines of “stronger,
tougher, bigger.” ‘ ,

It’s working, because the Panthers are
on top of the Big East West Division.

nationally. . ‘

They are surprising most people around
the nation. But not Howland

“I really. did [think we were going to be
this good this year],” Howland said "Ihis is
what we are supposed to do.” '

The hard-nosed Panthers are clawing up
the rankings by diving for loose balls, pres-
suring opponents every possession and
refusing to be out-muscled. Sounds like a
good ﬁt _for the Steel Town. ' ,

Even after almost winning‘ the Big‘East

Toumament and advancing to the second
round of the National Invitational
Tournament last year, Pitt still did not have

the respect oflthe Big East coaches as

they picked the team to ﬁnish sixth in the

seven-tearn West Division. —
Howland_shrugged it oif. He knew what.
his team was capable of. ~

‘That’s the thing I’ll say about this

Howland said. “They’re very, very

That leadership begins with ‘ Brandin

In his three season at Pitt, head coach Ben Howland has cleaned up the Pitt

last year Howland stressed that his team
needed to be stronger and in better shape.
Knight listened.

“You don’t improve unless you ‘work

hard at his game all summer long. He really
worked hard in the weight room”

Ice Panthers get revenge on IUP

The Pitt men’s ice hockey team took on

‘ a tough Indiana University of Pennsylvania
squad‘Friday night at the Airport Ice Arena,
and came away with a 6-2- win.

‘ The win for the.Panthers was the ﬁrst
over IUP in nine games, dating back to the
1996-97 season. '

_ Pitt wasted little time getting on the

scoreboard, notching a goal just one minute _

and 17 seconds into the contest. Forward
Mike King skated into the zone and ripped a
slap shot past IUP goaltender Andy Cuny.
Pitt controlled much of the play early in the
ﬁrst period.

IUP got its ﬁrst power play opportunity’
when Panther Kyle Reid was called for trip-

ping at the 14:47 mark _
Pitt penalty killers dominated ‘on -the

man advantage, not allowing IUP to register '

a shot on goal. _ I

Softball team ready to win with group of seniors

CHRIS VANASDALAN
The Pitt News

No one can tell the Panthers softball
team they aren’t working hard.

They are determined to have a
strong season after ﬁnishing a disap'-
pointing 14-39 last season, putting them
eighth in the Big East.

The team’s goal this year is the Big
East tournament. With the top four
teams in the conference receiving invi-
fifth—year coach
Michelle Phalen feels they have a good
chance, but it starts with fundamentals,
speciﬁcally hitting. '

Hitting is in someway involved
with every one of the team’s practices.

.“We’.ve gone back to the basics,
looking at individual mechanics,”
Phalen said. “We need to be able to take
control of some games early. We can do
that with the.seniors leading the way.”

The Panthers will need to control
games. They have a tough task ahead of
them with 42 of their 60 games on the
road. The team opens the season Feb.
15 in San Diego. The team doesn’t have
its homeopener until Mar. 21 which
features a double—header against St.
Francis.

The team has 12 players returning
from last season’s squad, five of whom
are starters. All three pitchers are back

Panthers buy into Howland’s winning system

The Program, page 15

onship game of the three-day University
Classic at Robert Morris College, did not
bother Howland

“The one loss against South Florida was
a tough one,” said Howland, “but that was
our sixth game in 10 days. I thought that
would give us some experience.”

And he was right.

Pitt rolled into their Big East schedule. It
beat St. ‘Johns for the ﬁrst time in eight tries,
knocked off then No. 11 Boston College and
defeated Rutgers as the No. 23 team in the

‘nation. It is Rutgers’ only loss at home to

date.

     
     
        
      
        
     
   
   

Pitt looked invincible. Their hot start
was reminiscent of the Billy Knight days of
the rnid— ‘70s. But the Panthers soon lost their
ﬁrst top'25 ranking since 1998. -

After a loss to Notre Dame at home and
dropping a doubleovertime game to Miami,

Pitt was. reeling when players other than '

Knight provided a spark

Sophomore guard Julius Page lit that
ﬁre, leading the team with 18 points in its
next game against Georgetown. Chevon
Troutrnan impressively handled Hoya star
Mike Sweetney, and ‘J aron Brown battled for
one of his infamous offensive rebounds to
layin the winning basket. '

Since then, Pitt has gone 6-1 while

sweeping Georgetown and Syracuse —
losing only to Notre Dame.

Georgetown coach Craig Esherick said _

that Pitt is “the best team in the league, no
doubt about it.” ,

The Panthers’ 21 wins is just four away
from the 1974-75 record of 25. They have
ﬁnally gained national respect as they rank
No. 14 in the Associated Press Poll.

“I didn’t know heiwas going to be as 9

good as he is; we got him -late,” Howland
said.

‘This JC coach walked up to me at the
end of July down in Orlando and said, ‘Hey
I got a guy for you.’ Everything worked out,
and he’s a great kid. He justﬁts right in to
exactly what you want.”

One might think after the success of the
team, the head coach would have a huge
ego. Not Howland

After Troutman’s ﬁrst impressive per-

formance against Georgetown, Howland’
I admitted the freshman should have been

playing more. Then he took the blame for the
Panthers’ second loss to Notre Dame after

speculation.

The future -

Howland has the team heading towards
its ﬁrst appearance in the" NCAA
Tournament since 1992-93.

Howland, whose daughter will be
attending Pitt next year, has no plans to jump
ship.

“My daughter’s really excited about A 2

being here next year,” he_said, “and -my son’s
going to be a freshman at Shadyside
Academy. They love it here and. we’ve
established roots.”

The support from -the University has
helped the once no-narne coach feel at home.

“After every win we have, Walt [Harris] - -

calls me,” he explained. “It really is a family.
Athletic Director Steve Pederson has really
fostered-that attitude along with the chancel-
lor in the athletic department,”

By losing only one senior, ‘having four ..

touted recruits itching to see action next year
and the Petersen Events Center set to open,
the foundation is set for Howland’s Pitt bas-

‘ ketball program to thrive.

coach by interviewing the Ravens’ Marvin
Lewis. We’ll let him think we’re going to
hire him, say the Glazers, but we really are

- still trying to ﬁnd a way to get Gruden from

the Raiders.
It reminds me of those girls in junior

_ high who, when you asked them out, would

say “I’ll think about it” with no intention of
ever giving you an answer. '

"So the Glazers tell General Manager
Rich McKay to try to get Gruden from the
Raiders. The only problem is Oakland
wanted more for Gruden than the Bucs
were willing to give up.

Now McKay is set to go to work on
making Lewis the team’s next coach. A

' contract is being prepared and the two start
' to assemble a coaching staff.

Not so fast, say those _crazy brothers.
They want to speak with Lewis face—to—face
before hiring him. _ ‘ '

After spending ﬁve hours with him at a

. Tampa restaurant, the Glazers decide that

Lewis is not the guy they want and force

‘I McKay to look somewhere else for a

coach. ,
Meanwhile, Lewis, who is in shock,

‘ heads back to Baltimore, ready to rejoin the

Ravens. Ir1stead, he ends up in Washington,
taking over as the Redskins new defensive
coordinator. , v
Now the Glazers really have no idea
who their next coach will be. lfthings aren’t
already bad enough, it seems McKay has
decided that he will soon be done working-
for the Bucs,—too. ‘ - . 
Wow, what a story. But wait, there is
more. V ’
_ Enter Marv Levy, the Hall of Fame
coach of the Buffalo Bills. 2 , —
Levy offers to coach the Bucs for-on
year, allowing the Glazers to end their
ridiculous process of ﬁnding a coach and to

Sounds like a good idea; but the
Glazers say no. p ,
Perhaps hiring Levy would have made

things too easy. Maybe they don’t like the _

idea of renting a Hall of Fame coach for one

season.

Let’s not forget we. are talking about
the owners of a franchise who made some-
thing as frightening as a pirate look like an
orange Muppet for almost 20 years.

So, to make a long story short, the Bucs
still don’t have a coach, Levy and Parcells
are still retired, Gruden is in Oakland,
Lewis is in D.C. and McKay spent Monday
on the golf course instead of at work.

As for the Glazers, they might be head-
edidown the same road as Jeny Jones, just

' without the plastic surgery.

utes to go, notching his 11th goal of the sea-
son.

IUP ﬁnally got on the board in the third
period when Brandon Smart unleashed a
slap shot that found its way past Garman.

Pitt wrapped up the scoring with a goal
at the 3:51 mark, courtesy of Matt
Hawryluk., his tearn-leading 12th goal of the
season.

. According to Iskey, Pitt’s physical play
was the key to its success. “All you have to
do is hit (IUP),” he said. ‘‘They’re all
ﬁnesse.” '

IUPhead coach Sam Kelly was quick to
give the Panthers credit “Pitt worked real

hard,” he saicl “They played real well.”

Iskey gave an idea of the satisfaction
that comes with beating IUP. “We hate them
as much as we hate Penn State,” he said. “In
fact, Ithinklhate them.more than I hate
Penn State. They talk shit the whole game.”

Pitt followed up the IUP victory with a
game Saturday night against Washington
and J etferson at the Iceoplex in Southpointe.
Coming of the big win, Pitt was rnanhandled
by W and J, losing by a score of 10-1.

The Panthers, who won 10 of their last

12 games, stand at 15-11 after their weekend A

split.

Pitt wraps up its regular season
Saturday night at the University of
Maryland.
