éjhe eight—year—old legal

moving to a higher court.
Yesterday (Ian. 21), lawyers
representing seven current and

who say Pitt’s policy discriminates
against gays and lesbians ﬁled an
appeal to the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania. ‘

Frederick G. Pohland, pro-
fessor and Edward R. Weidlein
Chair of Environmental Engi-

9, 2004, at UPMC Monteﬁore.
He was 72. ‘

A memorial service will be
held tomorrow, Jan. 23, at
1:30 p.m. in Heinz Memorial
Chapel. ‘

Pohland authored more than
I 50 technical and scientiﬁc publi-
cations on such issues as solid and
hazardous waste management,

environmental impact assessment .

and innovative technologies for
minimizing and treating waste.
“Fred was an engineer’s engi—
neer, and he always put , forth
maximum effort. He did pivotal
research and accomplished just
about everything you can do in
engineering,” said Leonard W.
Casson, an associate professor
in Pitt’s Department of _Civil and
Environmental Engineering.
An expert on sanitary landﬁlls,
Pohland developed the concept

of the “bioreactor landﬁll” in A

which liquid that drains out of a
landﬁll is deposited back on top
of the landﬁll in order to treat

waste. “That was Fred’s pivotal.

accomplishment,” Casson said.
“It provides an environmental

solution for treating "waste, It
also saves landﬁll companies
rnoney because they don’t have
to pay for external treatinent.
So, it helps the environment,
it helps the landﬁll to stabilize
and it helps. the companies. It’s
a win-win technology on all
accounts.” -

Pohland was active in many
professional organizations,
including the American Society
of Civil Engineers, the Ameri-
can Academy of Environmental
Engineering and the National
Academy of Engineering. A
member of the Oakland Rotary

Frederick G. Pohland

Club, Pohland was named a Paul
Harris Fellow, the highest honor
given to a Rotarian.

He received numerous honors
and awards from environmental
and professional organizations.
In 1996, Pohland was awarded

an honorary doctor of science-

degree by Valparaiso University
in Indiana, where 44years earlier
he had earned his undergraduate
degree in civil engineering.

, He also was a consultant and
adviser to industry and govern-

School of Education who worked
with Mulgrave at Pitt during the

1970s and ’80s, said, “Whether 1
it was his devotion to his son, ‘,
David, who has Down syndrome,

and to making his life comfort-

_ able and fulﬁlling, or whether

it was cooking a great meal for 1

new ‘graduate students who were
away from home, he was always
so generous with his time. He
had incredible energy, and he
did things for people without
them even asking.”

Capson saidMulgrave treated
her almost like a daughter. “He
argued to increase my salary,

and it worked. I was able to buy I

a home because of that, and when

I did he helped me ﬁnd one in

“Mt. Lebanon,” where she and

the Mulgrave family became
neighbors and close friends.

“Butl realized over the years, i

it wasn’t just me who felt close
to him,” Capson added. “He
treated everyone with dignity and
respect. He used to say that ‘Even
people you have difﬁculty with
should never detect that in you.’
I would describe him as a man
with impeccable morality when
it came to doing the right thing.
He simply would see some need
 work to fulﬁll it. It wasn’t
ever abouthim.” ’ ‘
Christine

International Affairs associate
professor emerita, remembers
Mulgrave as a dedicated, caring
colleague who enjoyed whatever
he was doing. “Norm had enthu-
siasm and a positive attitude and
loved to bring people along, by
teaching or talldng to them or
advising them. He really cared
about everything he did.”

. Altenburger said Mulgrave,
who was a licensedpsychologist,
was an expert in psychological
testing design and measurement.

9 The two teamed up to administer

tests for police, ﬁreﬁghters and
other public servant candi-
dates.

Altenburger, -
Graduate School of Public and-

mug in the 1960s, in what was
then called the Institute of
Local Governments, to develop
and administer police‘ testing,
something we continued to do‘
right up  I saw Norm for the

last time in December,” Alten— 

burger said. “In the ’60s, very
often appointments to police and
ﬁre departments were patronage
positions. We wanted to go out
into the ‘community and profes-
sionalize measuring the ﬁtness of
the candidates for those public
servant positions.”

Robert Dunkelman, secretary
of the University emeritus, said
that Mulgrave was a popular
faculty member at Pitt.

“Norm had a wonderful and
easy personalitythat made him
easy to get along with. ‘He loved
being a faculty member, meeting
and advising students. He and I

served on many University com— ‘
mittees together so I got to know 1

him quite well. He was a staunch
advocate for faculty concerns, but
also very respectful and under-
standing that not everything can
be done by the administifation.”
Dunkelman added that Mul-
grave was a tireless promoter
-of rights for the disabled. “He
was very involved in the Special
Olympics, and on occasion he

testiﬁed in Harrisburg, pushing-
for legislation that would aid V

handicapped citizens.” . I .

In 1974, Mulgrave helped
found Citizen Care Inc., a com—
munity-based support organiza-
tion for the developmentally
disabled, and he -had chaired its
board since its inception.‘ He also
served on the boards of Achieva
(formerly the Association of
Retarded Citizens of Allegheny
County) and The Arc of Greater

for the disabled. He began volun-

21 st-century communication?

Increasingly, we use e—mail to communicate with colleagues
around the world, across campus, even down the hall. Many
departments and schools now routinely communicate with their
faculty, students and staff through e—mail rather than using
printed mailings. But the University of Pittsburgh continues to
T rely on telephone Audix messages and printed memos to ofﬁcially

communicate with staff, faculty and students. I rarely listen to
the weekly Audix announcements; many others have told me
that they, too, delete these messages without even listening- to
. them. Printed notices don’t fare much better: They often get
buried in the pile of unread mail that accumulates during the
semester. And, the costof printing and mailing hundreds of
notices abouta speciﬁc lecture seems like an unnecessary expense ‘
for the University in this time of declining budgets. 1

WE NEED A BETTER SYSTEM.

Technically, it would be simple to have a standard e—mail‘
distribution list for general University armouncements. Every-
one could be placed on this list automatically. Those who didn’t

- want to receive such e—mails could notify a designated person
andbe removed from the list. The same unit now responsible
for approving Audix announcements or for approving general

‘ _ University  could still have oversight of what is sent

‘ _, out  fcm, general ,University l_ist., S,u1f,e,ly,,1;l1e.__ ..

cost of this would be far less than we now pay for.having Audix

5 messages recorded by a staff member or for typing, printing

and mailing notices. E-mail communication also would be more
convenient for most of us. It is very simple to delete an e—mail
message that is of no interest. Listening to a list of the weekly
messages on the Audix system in order to know what types of
messages are there takes much more timethan a quick skim of

The technology for e—mail distribution lists is well devel-
oped. It is easy to set up a, general’ University-wide list. The
University could be even more sophisticated and allow people
to sign up for lists devoted to speciﬁc_ topics. For example, one
e—mail list might’ be University announcements about new
computerviruses or worms. This would provide very rapid
distribution of important information from a trusted source.
Another list could be devoted to sports events. Another might
be information about research studies. Another e—mail list could
be announcementsof University lectures. Units that oversee
each of the activities could be responsible for maintaining the
associated list. For example, the Athletics Department could
 the list for announcements of sports events. Comput-
ing Services and Systems Development could send out notices
about computer viruses or other computing issues to list focus— _

Implementation of this proposal does not have to be labor
intensive. Listserver technology allows people to automatically
add or delete their names from any particularlist by sending an
e—mail message to the list. It would not be ‘necessary to assign‘

Nor would a staff person be required to send out these mail-
ings. A list can be set up ‘in ‘such a way that any list member is
allowed to post information to others on the list. (Or, a list can
be centrally managed where only a designated person sends out
all the announcements.) Pitt has a program called Majordomo
that can be used to develop and manage lists for any academic
purpose. For more information, see http://wwW.pitt.edu/ .

It is time for the University to move into the.21st century
and adopt new technology that will make all our lives a little

Pitt Club ends lunch service

he Pitt Club’s weekday
lunch service in Gard-
ner Steel Conference

Center has been discontinued
permanently, Food Services

. ofﬁcials said this week.

“The Pitt Club as an entity
is" still accepting membership,
but [Dec. 13] we stopped the
lunch service because it wasn’t
self-sustaining,” said Martin
Millner, general manager of
Sodexho Management Services,
the company Pitt employs to
staff food service locations
around campus. Millner said
the lunch crowd averaged fewer
than 30 customers a day, which
was insufficient to support the
kitchen and wait staff.

«According to Pitt spokesper-
son Robert Hill, this spring the

Pitt Club’s main dining room

in Gardner Steel Conference
Center will be converted for
academic uses, ‘while the private
dining rooms will continue to be
available for Pitt Club-catered
events, as they have been in the
past. “The Pitt Club still exists,
and it can sponsor events in
Gardner Steel as well as at other
campus locations,” Hill said.

Of the ﬁve Sodexho service A

workers who staffed the Pitt
Club lunches, four have been
transferred to other Food Ser-
vices areas. Pitt Club manager
Madeline Gamble, who will con-
tinue workin g there temporarily,
will eventually be transferred to
catering services, Nlillner said;
Gamble said, “We will con-
tinue\all our other catered activi-
ties,” which include pre-athletic
contest dinners and brunches,

parties, theme events, trips and
theatre events. She said the Pitt
Club has about 600 members, a
number that’s remained steady
for the last several years. Mem-
bers have been alerted by mail
that the lunch service has been
terminated, she said.

“But it’s a little sad they’re
closing the lunches down,”

Gamble said. “I was here the I

ﬁrst day it opened 20 years ago,
and I remember saying then,
‘I’ll probably be here when it
closes.”’

Membership in the.Pitt Club
is open to Pitt and UPMC fac-

ulty and staff, alumni, graduate .

students and parents of current
students, subject to approval of
the board of governors. For more

New compound may lead to Alzheimer’s breakthrough

Pitt scientists in collaboration
with researchers at Sweden’s
Uppsala University have laid
the groundwork for a new era
in Alzheimer’s disease research
by completing the ﬁrst human

study ofa compound that,

through. positron emission
tomography, enables them to
peer into the brains of people
with the memory—stealing ill-
ness and see the telltale plaque
deposits they believe are at the
root of the disease. ,
Alzheimer’s is a debilitating
brain disease that affects memory
and cognitive function in approxi-
mately 4 million Americans today

next 50 years. The distinguishing
factor between Alzheimer’s and
other dementias is the formation
of a protein substance called beta— I
amyloid, or amyloidiplaque, that
is believed to contribute to the
death of brain cells.

Results _ of the study were .
chosen for rapid publication
online in the earlyview section
of Annals of Neurology. 5

According to the research-

C ers, creation of the compound,

dubbed Pittsburgh Compound
B (PIB), is a signiﬁcant devel-
opment that may provide long-

sought answers to questions"

of how the disease begins and
grows, as well as contribute to
a better understanding of how
effective new drug therapies are
at preventing, delaying or treat-
ing Alzheimer’s.

“PIB has given us a new tool
to view the amount of amyloid in
the brains of living Alzheimer’s-
disease patients,” said William

»E. Klunk, associate professor
of psychiatry at Pitt’s School of
Medicine and co—inventor of PIB .

. “Usin g PIB, we will likely be able
t f<?1.1.€2.Y»»,V...t.l!.‘=..B.—.I.°£.gTF’-§.§i9I1 of the

ment of promising new therapies
aimed at halting the build-up of
amyloid in the brain.” ’
Alzheimer’s disease, like
stroke, is a signiﬁcant cause of
dementia in people over the age
' of 65. But unlike stroke, which
begins with a single, event, there
is no way for doctors to pinpoint
when the brains of people with
Alzheimer’s begin, to change,

and this lack of knowledge is a

real detriment when it comes to

creating and testing therapies to
‘ prevent the illness. 5

The plaque deposits form in
areas of the brain where memory
and cognitive functions are car-
ried out, while leaving areas
responsible for motor functions
alone. This means a person with
Alzheimer’s can be cognitively
helpless while being physically
robust.

Actual visual inspection of

amyloid in the brain has been
the only way to make a deﬁni-
tive diagnosis ofAlzheimer’s, and

~ previously could only be done at
autopsy.

to detect and quantify amyloid
in the brain has the poten-

_ tial to impact several areas of

Alzheimer’s research, including
the assessment of anti—amyloid
treatments under development
by many ,major pharmaceutical
companies. PIB may allow us to
study the very roots of Alzheim-
er’s by assessing the extent of amy-
loid deposition in people years
before Alzheimer’s symptoms
appear.” ’

(IANIA) and a University trustee, will be the featured s o eaker for
Pitt’s 28th annual honors convocation, at'3 p.m.
Feb. 27 in Carnegie Music Hall.

DeAngelis’s address is titled “The Importance
of Caring.” Prior to the talk, Chancellor Mark
A. Nordenberg will confer an honorary degree

DeAngelis, who began her duties as JANIA
editor three years ago, also is editor—in-chief of scientiﬁc publi-
cations and multimedia applications for the American Medical
Association. She oversees JAMA, as well as its archives publica-

Previously, DeAngelis was editor-in-chief of Archives of
Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and vice dean for academic
affairs and faculty atjohns Hopkins University School of Medi-
cine. She continues to hold a faculty position there as professor

DeAngelis has written or edited 10 books, and written more

CSSD jobs at D

he positions of 11 staff
members” in Computer
. Services and Systems

Development (CSSD) were
eliminated last November, Uni-
versity ofﬁcials conﬁrmed.

— The —11 staff all worked
at RIDC _Park in the CSSD
Operations Center, which is
being replaced by a new system,
according to Pitt spokesperson
Robert Hill.

“The services that were per-
formed by this center had lost
their relevance in today’s highly
technological environment,”
Hill said. Pitt is implementing a
Network Operations Center to
replace and expand the functions
of the obsolete CSSD center, he
said. '

Unlike its predecessor‘, “the
new Network Operations Center
will be the centrallylocated, inte-
grated comprehensive center
responsible for University—wide
information technology services,
including data monitoring, server
functions, applications mainte-

‘ nance and power—outage resolu-

tions. That new system requires
new equipment and will include
the redeployment of some cur-

rent staff responsibilities. In fact, _
some of the 11 staff who were.

displaced may be offered the
opportunity to apply for jobs in
the new center,” Hill said.
“This new Network Opera-
tions Center ﬁts in with the
continuing integration of new

5 information technology services

into the University’s general

 

 
 
    

infrastructure, as articulated in
goals set by the University’s ‘An
Information Technology Foun-
dation for the 21st Century’
plan,” Hill said.

"That document was issued
by the Provost’s ofﬁce in May
2000.

According to CSSD direc-
tor Jinx Walton, the, Network
Operations Center, currently in
transition from the old system, is
expected to be fully operational
by late spring.

Ron Frisch, associate vice
chancellor for Human Resources,
said-thatnone ofthe 11 staffmem-
bers was dismissed for cause. “In
such cases‘ where staff positions
are eliminated, the University
does provide all those people
who were in hard—money—funded
positions some form of limited
ﬁnancial continuation, which
varies._” ‘

.< ‘ ._. 

Frisch declined to offer details i

on the University’s severance pay
formula. 1

“We do have a person at
Human Resources committed

to working with those indiVidu- ‘
als, to help with resumes, to help

with searchingfor job positions,
and with job placement within the
University, where appropriate,”
Frisch said. ,

Hill said no other staff
position eliminations of this
magnitude are expected, “other
than a position here or there in

the normal course of University 5

business.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

   
   

en Frank Valentich
ﬁrst took a job at Pitt
_ 40 years ago, it was a
gun that got him in the door.

“I showed the personnel
manager the 38—caliber pistol
I had made, and he hired me,”
the expert machinist said, with a
twinkle in his eye.

True story.

(Although,Valentichconﬁdes,
essentially what got him the job
was that the personnel manager
at then—Carnegie Tech, where
Valentich recently had been laid
off, recommended him to Pitt’s
personnel manager.)

At that time, Robert Patton
chaired the psychology depart-
ment and wanted a machine
shop to support research, Val-
entich said. “Dr. Patton and I
got along real well. I think he
appreciated that I was going to
night school at Pitt for vocational
teacher education at the time,ithat
I was a musician, and that I built
instruments.”

In 1963, Valentich began
working in a 500 sq.—ft. shop at
Clapp Hall, where the chief task
was building mazes for laboratory
mice studies.

In 1968, he was asked to
design and order the machinery
for a machine shop at the newly
built Crawford Hall, where he
started working the follow-
ing year. He’s been there ever
since, essentially a one—person
operation in the 2,000 sq.—ft.
basement shop, still using much

  
     
   
   

of the original equipment. “I’m
in my own little world here,”
Valentich said.

Since its opening, his machine
shop has run the gamut of work
from precision machine tooling
to woodwork to sheet metal cut-
ting to welding, with occasionally
some furnitureand valve repair,
Valentich said.

Mostly, Valentich supports
Pitt faculty and graduatestudent
researchers in chemistry, biology
and neuroscience, building spe-
cialized laboratory equipment.
“Each project is different, and I
honestly have no idea how many
different devices I’ve built over
the years, including many times
building the tools necessary to
complete the job.” I‘ ,

Typically, a professor will
approach him with an idea, per-
haps a few crude drawings and,
through discussion, the two hash
out what’s needed and what can
and can’t be done.

“This gives me a lot of satisfac-
tion,” Valentich said. “That’s the
beauty of what’s going on here:
I interact directly with faculty
members, and I have a say—so
in how they’re going to do a
particular project.”

Sometimes he finds itdifﬁcult
when a professor is wed to his
or her design drawings, because
the speciﬁed dimensions can be
irrelevant to a device’s ﬁmction.
“Eventually, you develop your
skill. I can design things in my
head” without a two—dimensional

model, he said. He also acknowl-
edges that he is a perfectionist.
“I like to take my time before I
plunge into anything. I don’t like
making any mistakes.” .

Valentich thinks he’s earned’
the respect of most faculty who
have worked with him. I

“I think most professors
will agree that maybe to have
a machine shop in the building
was not absolutely necessary, but
it saved them from having to go
outside to buy their stuff, to check
machines out elsewhere, to get
drawings,” Valentich said. “I’ve
always said,_‘If, you can buy it, [I
can Build it.’ We‘design itiliere,
we engineer it here, we make it
here — we’re a one—stop shop, so
they advanced in their research a
little quicker.” -

Occasionally, faculty mem-
bers find him intimidating
because the work he does is alien
to most academicians, something.-

” Valentich confesses gives him a

chuckle. “You do run. into some
professors who do have experi-
ence, and they aren’t intimidated.
But I think in this country they
don ’t teach academicians enough
hands-on experience, especially
people who are in research. All
they know how to do is order
something out of a catalog. ‘

“But hands-on experience
is like having a set of chains on
your tires" when you’re going up
a snow—covered hill: It gives you
a little bit of an edge. . .

“Professors shouldn’t be

 

intimidated by me. It’s true I
know more than they do about
this stuff, but I’m here to help.”
CI

_The son of Croatian immi-
grants, Valentich, who speaks
ﬂuent Serbo-Croatian, credits his
uneducated parents for instilling
a strong work ethic in him.

“My father, who was a house-
builder in the old country, came
here in 1914. By the time my
mother got here [in 1925], he
owned a house, and he had
expanded it himself. He put in
central heating, which was a big
deal, including installing the
furnace himself. My father and
mother never had a day of school
in their lives, but he got a job at
a Westinghouse brass foundry.

He always had tools, and we '

always had a machine shop in
our house.” '

Short on money, Valentich’s
father would make toys for his
sons, who picked up the habit of
building things from scratch. “So
I’ve been doing this same thing
since I was a little kid.” I

As evidence, Valentich pro-
duced his ﬁrst grade report card
ﬁlled with respectable grades, but
with a conspicuous comment:
“Has dirtyhands.” “I used to pick
up things and take them home all
the time. I was always recycling
before it was even a word.”

During the Depression,
Valentich’s oldest brother John
learned to play music at the
South Slavic Workers Home in
East Pittsburgh.

With tools at home, John
began building his own instru-
ments in the late ’3 0s, and taught
his brothers, including Frank, the
trade, which developed into a side‘
business ofbuilding and repairing
musical instruments, particularly

rank Valentich displays arecent creation, ullt for aneuro-

   
   

the tamburitzas common in the
East Pittsburgh Slavic com—
munity.

“All four of my brothers
learned to playmusic, and I played "
in grade school and at Turtle
Creek High School,” he said.

‘He earned a music scholarship

to Duquesne, where he followed
a brother into the Tamburitzans,
but that was short—lived.

“I wasn’t much into school.
I. didn’t exactly ﬂunk out, but
instead of doing my work, I’d be
busy reading Popular Mechan-
ics,” he said. c,

He still plays the bass viol in
local bands, including the Tam-
buraski Orkestar Selo, which fea-
tures traditional Slavic music.

And he still builds and repairs
musical instruments out of his
home.

After he left Duquesne, Val-
entich entered an apprentice-
ship through connections with
his Army Reserves captain, who
also urged Valentich to enroll at
Pitt in vocational teacher educa-
tion to supplement his machinist
training. ~ V

Valentich worked at Westing-
house operating large generators,
and later at a Neville Island com— .
pany that made parts for the oil ,
industry. After he was laid off,
Carnegie Tech hired him.

Now, 40 years later, retire-
ment from Pitt is the farthest
thing from his mind. “I’ve had
a great time here; veryfew bad
experiences. Overall, I don’t have
any problem getting up in the
morning to go to work. I’ve never
missed a day because of weather.
And when I leave here tonight,
I’m going to go home and do the
same things I dohere, working in
my shop at home,” he said. A

JANUARY 22, 2004

Appeal planned in same-sex beneﬁts ruling

CONTINUED FROM PAGE I

in Common Pleas Court and
won a temporary injunction
from Gallo.

University ofﬁcials say Pitt
does not discriminate against
gays and lesbians and is legally
within its‘ rights to use marriage
as the determining factor in
granting spousal beneﬁts. Oppo-
nents of Pitt’s policy point out
that homosexuals cannot legally
marry in: Pennsylvania.

Gallo, both in his recent

ruling and his earlier tempo-

raryinjunction, sided with the
University.

In the four-page opinion he
issued Jan. 12, Gallo wrote that
Pitt has no legal obligation, under
the city’s 1990 anti—discrirr1ina-

tion ordinance or otherwise, “to”

offer [a] medical insurance beneﬁt
under its health, insurance pro-
gram to the domestic partners of
its employees.”

Even if the city’s human rela—‘

tions commission were to ﬁnd

that Pitt’s health beneﬁts policy is

‘ discriminatory, Gallo concluded,

the commission would lack the
power to impose a remedy. That’s
because of a 1999 state law that
exempts public universities such
as Pitt from local ordinances that
would force them to offer spou-
sal health beneﬁts to employees’
same-sex partners.

Pitt’s critics accused the
University and state lawmakers
of colluding to get the law passed
expressly to block Pittsburgh’s
human relations commission
from hearing the ‘discrimination

 ' claim-%1§<g5ainst:Pitt-“’-—‘>a*charge1:hat~* --

University ofﬁcials deny.
Cl

C Pitt ofﬁcials welcomed Gallo’s

Jan. 12 ruling with the following '

statement: “Although the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh always main-
tained that litigation was not the
proper forum to settle the issue
of domesticpartner health insur-
ance beneﬁts, we are nevertheless

pleased that the court agrees with

our legal positions that the city
ordinance never required us to
offer the beneﬁts. and that using
marriage as a basis for offering the
beneﬁts is not discriminatory.”
Chris Biancheria, one of the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) attorneys representing
the current/ former Pitt employ-
ees, said Gallo’s ruling “was not
exactly a complete surprise. We’d
had some indication of the judge’s
thinking from the preliminary
injunction he’d ordered a while
back. But nonetheless, we had

good arguments and We’d held
out some hope, so it was deﬁnitely
disappointing.

“The 1999 state law on which
Judge Gallo rested his decision
is ﬂagrantly unconstitutional,”
Biancheria maintained. “It was
passed, apparently as a favor to
Pitt, without following [consti-
tutional] procedures. The judge
completely overlooks that in his
opinion. We also think he was
in error in forbidding the city’s
human relations commission
from holding any more hear-
ings on this case. It deprives our
clients of the chance to present
further evidence” that Pitt’s ben-
eﬁts policy discriminates.

The upcoming Common-
wealth Court of Pennsylvania
process in the Pitt same-sex
beneﬁts case “could go on for a

year, give or take‘ a few months, A

before that court rules on our
appeal,” Biancheria estimated.

, Bruce L. Venarde, one of
the plaintiffs seeking to force
Pitt to offer same-sex health
beneﬁts, said: “I’m very sad-and
very angry at the extraordinary

lengths to which Pitt has gone

to repeatedly block the civil
rights law, to the extent that we
cannot even get a hearing on a
civil rights complaint. This is a
shameful thing.”-

Venarde, a Pitt associate
professor of history and associ-

‘ ates chairperson of the history

department, noted that a grow-
ing number of U. S. corporations
-4:'—*%1:l’ongvvith 4%5’»(4)fPi-tI2’S6,9-fel-low
members of the Association of
American Universities — offer
health beneﬁts to their employ-
ees’ same-sex partners. “So, we’re
behind such ‘flamingly liberal
institutions’ as the University of
Colorado and Purdue,” he said.
Under a deal reached in
May 2001, Pitt pledged to con-

sider extending same-sex health

beneﬁts; in return, Venarde and

his fellow plaintiffs‘ suspended '

their lawsuit. After 10 months
of study, a committee of Pitt
faculty, staff, students, admin-
istrators and trustees concluded
in spring 2002 that, while the
University eventually should
extend the beneﬁts “it would
not be prudent” to do so in the
current political climate. Harris-
burg lawmakers had threatened
to cut off Pitt’s state funding if the
University began offering health‘
insurance to employees’ gay and
lesbian partners. ‘

To Venarde, the committee’s
conclusion didn’t ring true. “If
Pitt had warfted to do it, they
could have said to the legisla-

-ture, years ago, ‘We didn’t have

any choice, because it’s the law,’

instead of trying to undermine.

the law, and spending outrageous
amounts of money doing it.

“The committee said Pitt
should offer these benefits
eventually, just not now. Well,
we’re tired of waiting and we’re
not going to let this go.”

Another plaintiff, Rae Anne
Lockard, said: “I think that
because this hasn’t been in the
news for many months until [Gal-
lo’s latest decision], many people
in this city and on this campus
thought that Pitt began to offer
these beneﬁts a while ago, when
other institutions started doing
it. We need to get the word out
that this cause continues to be
fought.

“Carnegie Institute, Carn-

egie-Mellon, even Mellon
Bank before they changed their
name offer these beneﬁts,” said
Lockard, head librarian ‘at the
Frick Fine Arts Library. “Pitt
is surrounded and, frankly, they
deserve to be singled out for this
refusal to grant these beneﬁts.
“My partner is unemployed
due to a disability, so I’m the
bread—winner for us and our

three children. My health care is
covered, but she requires medica-
tions that amount to over $500 a
month above what she’s covered
for by Medicare.

“I have given Pitt a lot of my
life, working here over 18 years,
and I’ve brought Pitt national
renown through my job with such
things as coordinating national
conferences here, and yet I have
to endure this continual slap in
the face. It is really beyond me
why Pitt would continue to do
this.”

integrated holistic approach
to mental health treatment for
individuals with problems related
to stress, anxiety and depression,
as well as related conditions such
as pain,” Glick said. In addition to

traditionalpsychopharmacology,
Glick will counsel individuals on
nutrition and supplements as well
as other activities and life—style
changes.

Psychotherapists will offer
services beyond the traditional
psychotherapies: eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing,
biofeedback, relaxation train-
ing, guided imagery and gestalt
therapy.

Other services include yoga
and meditation classes. I

 T UNIVERSITY TIMES

Would incentives prompt staff,
omes near Pitt?
Oakhmd neighborhoods \

faculty to buy h

ould Pitt employees

consider buying

homes in neighbor-

hoods close to the University if

incentives were in place to help
them? ,

V That is the thrust of a new on-

line survey designed to measure

Pitt employee interest in home

' ownership in select nearby neigh-

borhoods of central Oakland,
South Oakland, West Oakland
and Hazelwood. (See map.)
The 20-plus question
survey (accessible at: http:
/ / surVeyweb.ucsur.pitt.edu/
sw/wchost.asp?st=housing
) is the ﬁrst step in measuring

the feasibility of establishing _.

an employer-assisted housing
(EAH) program through the
University, according to Tracy
Soska, chair of the Senate’s
community relations committee,
which is sponsoring the survey.
The deadline for ﬁlling out the
survey is March 1.

Soska stressed that the smvey
is exploratory, a marketing vehi-
cle rather than a scientiﬁc study,
and that no plans are in place to

,, offer EAH beneﬁts at Pitt.

The idea arose ﬁ‘om strategies
put forth by Pitt’s Community
Outreach -Partnership Center
(COPC), said Soska, who also is

. co-director of that partnership.

"‘A COPC working group on
housing helped put together the
survey, working in support of

  

   

/V 5th avenue.shp
-" / Oaidand streetashp
West_oakiand.shp
South__oakland.shp
 Central_oakIand.shp

   

Oakland and Hazelwood com-
munity organizations seeking to
enhance home ownership and
neighborhood revitalization,”

Soska said. (He added that North

Oakland and Shadyside, as estab-

lished and stable neighborhoods

less in need of revitalization, are

not included in the survey.)
“FacultyAssembly and Senate

‘ Council last spring endorsed pur-

suing the possibility of offering

employer-assisted housing

services, and we will report our
survey ﬁndings back to them.”
UPMC employees are-invited to

ﬁll out the EAH on-line survey,

as well, he said.

Also last spring, the commu-
nity relations committee heard
a report from Fannie Mae, ‘a
national private. company that
provides mortgage money and
other employer—assisted services
in support of affordable housing.
Depending on what parties agree
to,- EAH services can include
home-buyer workshops; help
in locating affordable housing;
ﬁnancial and credit counseling;
closing costs assistance; down
payment assistance; matching
savings; “rent to buy” options,
andloan guarantees.

‘ “As part of this effort, we’ve

also begun, to ‘look at other

employer-assisted housing
programs at other universities”
including the University of
Kentucky and the University of

. Pennsylvania, Soska said.

“Penn’s not exactly like
us. Penn’s program is in their
immediate campus area but it’s
combined with some develop-
ment projects that the university
is doing,” Soska said. “Kentucky’s
is a program operating in con-
junction with the city [of Lex-
ington] .to develop some key
neighborhoods, and it’s handled
through the [university’s] human
resources ofﬁce, where they do
workshops to advise people. So,
they’re a few steps ahead of us
right now.” i P —

. Soska acknowledged that
most EAH programs include
financial support from the
employing vinstitution. “How-
ever, we’re not trying to put this
University into a position where

they’d have to underwrite loans’. ”

We’re cautious of that. But this
type of program does fit in
with both the community’s and
University’s short— and long-term

housing strategy, increasing the

area’s stability and lessening
problems of absentee landlords

and housing code violations, ‘

maintenance, safety and other
issues,” Soska said. . ,

The on-line EAH survey was
designed by Pitt’s University
Center for ‘Social and Urban
Research, which will evaluate
the data.’ I

The Senate’s community rela-
tions comrr1ittee, in conjunction
with several Oakland community
groups including the Oakland
Task Force, Oakland Planning
and Development Corp. and

District, also will be seeking,

input on which kinds of busi-
nesses Pitt employees want to

' see near campus.,A separate

Calculus 3.”

_ As, for Pitt students who
major in math, Metzger said
Pitt’s Honors College “has done
an amazing job of bringing in
excellent students in all kinds
of majors, but math has been
exceptionally blessed.”

He noted that Pitt senior
Cynthia Kinnan, the University’s
most recent Marshall Scholar

.. (she’s currently attending the

London School of Economics)
is double-majoring in math and
economics. Other Pitt math
undergrads recently presented
research papers at a meeting of
the American Mathematical Soci-
ety, and department graduates
have gone on to do doctoral work
in elite math departments such as
Princeton’s, said Metzger.

“We’ve had great students in
the past, but I think We’re get-
ting even more of them today,”
he said. “Instead of the one or
two really brilliant students you
might have gotten in an upper-
level math course here say, ﬁve
years ago, today ydu’ll see six or
seven. That gives you a critical
mass that can raise the whole
level of the class.”

Stephen Carr, an associate
professor of English, said he’s
seen the same phenomenon
in Pitt upper-level literature
courses. “We’ve always had
some wonderful students here,
but I think we’re getting more
and more of the very best stu-
dents,” he said. “Instead of one
or two really excellent students

 anupper-levelclass, you’ll get

five or six these days.”

As for incoming students,
Carr said: “The freshmen We’re
seeing in our department have
done a lot more writing in high
school. They’re more interested
in working on their writing, not
just because it’s a requirement
but because they actually want
to become better writers.

“Overall, I would say that
today’s freshmen are better writ-
ers than freshmen of ﬁve or 10
years ago,” said Carr, who teaches
Seminar in Composition (fresh-
man writing) and Introduction to
Critical Reading (the ﬁrst course
for English majors and also a writ-
ing-intensive “W” course taken

by freshmen and sophomores

from other departments).

James Seitz, director of
composition in the English
department, said he’s discussed
student quality with numerous
colleagues who teach freshman
composition courses regularly.
“VV1thout exception, everybody
has said that they’ve seen a
striking improvement in recent
years,” Seitz said. “And I say that
as somebody who normallywould
be skeptical about upper-ad1nin-
istration claims that we’re going
‘to be seeing stronger students
just because of improvements in
SAT scores.

“I don’t know that SAT
scores make much of a differ-
ence in student quality,” Seitz
said, “although the fact that
we’re getting more students who
graduated in the upper quintile
of their high school classes prob-
ably illustrates that these students
worked hard in high school and
probably did better in their high
school English classes than stu-

dents who enrolled here in the
ast.”

Nearly all A&S undergrads
take the English department’s
freshman composition course;
earning an exemption requires a
score of 600 on the SAT’s verbal
section as well as a 5 (the high-
est score) on an English advanced
placement test. “So, we’re seeing
freshmen from all kinds of [A& S]
majors,” Seitz pointed out. Most
of these freshmen come to Pitt
having already mastered basic
writing skills such as producing
well-constructed, 3-page essays,
he said.

“In the past,” Seitz said,
“many of us would have seen it as
a primary obligation to get fresh-
men up to speed on elementary
things. But today, most freshmen
come here with the basics down
and they’re ready to make the
leap to more advanced forms of
academic literacy.

“Now, that doesn’t mean that
you won’t have two or three stu-
dents in any class of 19 [the enroll-
ment limit for freshman composi-
tion] who are struggling, whom
you send to the Writing Center
for extra tutorial help, whom you
meet with inyour ofﬁce to go over
basic things. But even as recently
as several years ago, you typically
might have seen 8—to-10 students
like that,” said Seitz.

Chemistry professor Peter
E. Siska, who teaches a general
chemistry course for Honors
College students, said: “I think
the number of students who are
really very well qualified to do
honors-level workin chemistry
has been going up.

“My class closes at 80 students
and I’ve been getting close to that
in recent years” whereas previous
years’ enrollments were consider-
ably lower, said Siska, who was a
2003 winner of A&S’s Tina and
David Bellet Teaching Excel-
lence award. (The other winner
was Seitz.) ‘ I

A faculty member herefor the
last  3 years, Siska said one of the
biggest changeshe’s seen among
Pitt’s undergraduate population

is the increase in out-of-state ’

students. “I think this has had

a ‘cosmopolitan-izing’ effect on -

western Pennsylvania students
and a great effect on out-of-class-
room activities, in thelab and just

in social interactions among my.

students,” he said.
The percentage ofnon—Penn-

sylvanians among Pitt freshman V
classes increased from 4 percent. ‘

in the mid-  9705, to 19 percentin
fall 1995, to 21 percent last fall.
“A lot more students seem to

be looking at Pitt as a desirable.

place to come, even if they’re
not ﬁom Pennsylvania and have
to pay the higher out-of-state
tuition,” Siska added. “I was
just talking the other day with a
young woman who had to choose
between coming here and accept-
ing an offer froman Ivy League
school. She ended up enrolling at
Pitt. Partly, it was an economic
decision — our out-of-state
tuition is still less expensive than
what you’d pay at an Ivy League
school — but she’s happy to be
here.”

Economics professor David
Dejong said “the higher quality
of students is certainly showing

up” in his upper—level, writing-
intensive Theory of Economic
Growth course. “I’ve received
some amazing essays in this
class. It’s struck me, reading
these papers: ‘Boy, I could never
have written anything this high-
quality when I was an under-
graduate.” '

Dejong also said he’s spend-
ing less time bringing students up
to speed on math needed for the
course. “That means I can cover
more material and spend more
time talking about economics,
which is what I want to be talk-
ing about.”

He added: “It’s readily appar-
ent, just from casual conversa-
tions I’ve had with other faculty
members in my department, that
my colleagues are seeing the same
thing” in terms of improved stu-
dent quality. -

“Students today just seem
to be more on top of things,”

concurred Shirley Cassing, the

economics department’s associate
chairperson for undergraduate
studies. She teaches Introduc-
tion to Nlicroeconomics among

‘ other freshmen-dominated intro

courses.

“I’m ﬁnding that ‘I get fewer
lame excuses from students for
not taking exams, for example.
You tell students what they need
to do and they end up doing it
and showing up for class. They
seem to have a different attitude
and show more initiative, even
compared with students from
ﬁve years ago.

“I get the sense that other
economics faculty feelthe same
way,” Cassing said. I

John Beverley, chairperson

T ,of..Hispanic..1ang11ages-,.and lit.-

eratures — Pitt’s largest foreign
language department — cited a
“pretty dramatic” improvement
in the departInent’s majors since
the 19805 but noted: “Assess-
ing the_ quality of students in
our beginning language classes

is more complicated because
they’re required courses, and
students who enroll in them
don’t always have the highest
motivation.” A
Hispanic’s coordinator of
undergraduate language instruc-

, tion, Beatrice DeAngelis, said

the anecdotal feedback she’s
gotten from the depart1nent’s
teaching assistants has been
mixed. “Some TAs rave about
their students. Some complain
about their students. I’m sorry
to say this, but I think there’s a
lot of grade inﬂation going on at
the lower levels, so grades alone
aren’t indicative of how well the
students are doing” compared
with previous years’ students.

The Hispanic department
is working hard to curb grade
inﬂation, she added.

“In physics, we are seeing
improvements in student perfor-
mance. There is no doubt about
that,” stated Chandralekha
Singh, a senior lecturer who
has won Pitt’s highest teaching
honor, the Chancellor’s Distin-
guished Teaching Award.

“I’m not certain, though,

exactly what these improve- «-
. ments should be attributed to,”

she said. “It seems that students’
preparation in high school is get-
ting better, and that must factor

K in. But then, I myself have been

using more and more innovative
strategies and methods in trying
to help my students do better, so
that may also be affecting their

I performance.” ~

‘ tudent quality also is on
the rise — with some

exceptions — in Pitt

' professional schools that admit

freshmen, according to faculty at
the College of Business Adminis-
tration (CBA) and the schools of

engineering and nursing.

Business Allniinistration
Robert Atkin has taught the
introductory course Manage-
ment in Complex Environments
since CBA opened in fall 1995. A
lectureand recitation course with
a required ﬁnal team project, it
still covers basic concepts, tools
and‘ skills needed in the busi-
ness world, said Atkin, but the
course content is vastly more
complicated today than nine
years‘ ago. . ' v
Part of that is due to globaliza-
tion and the rapidly expanding
discipline of management, he
said. But another reason the
course has been toughened,

.v Atkin said, is that CBA students

today are smarter and can handle
the added challenge.
‘ “When the CBA ﬁrst opened,

there was a boom of students.

Honestly, many of them thought '

that if they could do two out of
three among walk, talk and
breathe, they could land a good
job,” said Atkin, an associate
professor of business administra-
tion who has been on the Katz

. Graduate School of Business
‘ faculty since 1987. He teaches «

MBA students as Well as CBA
freshmen.

Today’s CBA students “know

they have to Work, and they are

motivated to work,” Atkin said.
“And that’s new. Their basic

lmowledge of business is gener-

” “ally better, they have some V

modest knowledge of what’s
going on in the world.”

Atkin wrote the textbook that
accompanies his intro course.
“As the result of having smartef
students, I have to continually

increase the difficulty of the
course to keep them from being
bored and , all getting A’s. This
includes adding conceptual depth
— agency theory, the asymmetry
of information, advanced market-
ing, economy break—ups — fairly
sophisticated topics. I have to add
about 15 percent to my textbook
every year,” he estimated.

As indicators of higher quality

’ in CBA, Atkin cited an increase
in students who take courses

above required levels, improved
computer skills, and anecdotal
feedback from colleagues and
former students.

“I’d say about 12-15 per-

cent of CBA freshmen [out of .

approximately 280] are taking
higher-level math courses than
they have to. It used to be we’d get
maybe 2 percentof students who
would do that,” Atkin said. “And
it’s more than thinking ahead to
graduate school, because this is a
higher level than they need even
for graduate business degrees.

“We also have a good number

of students enrolled in honors
economics and honors courses
in general.”

VVhile computer literacy
among CBA students has
increased dramatically over the

years, this is a double—edged

sword, according to Atkin. “Stu-
dents think they can download
anything and present it without
attribution, andthey think ‘that’

everyt]iingthé'y'ﬁhdis'factufal,”ihe  

said. “So, we have to teach them
about inconsistencies ‘of data.”
Feedback from former

it’s from competing on athletic

ties. They’re remarkably well-
equipped for teamwork, often
better than the men students.”

Unfortunately, writing and
analytical skills continue to be
poor among CBA freshmen,
according to Atkin.

. “Let’s put it this way: The
best students write well, but the
average students do not write
well,” he said. “I also think that,
no matter how strong the second-
ary education, critical thinking is
not something they come to us
with, so we really have to teach
that almost from scratch.” ‘

Engineering

The strongest indicator of
rising quality among School of
Engineering undergraduates is
that the school is working to
establish a ﬂexible, interdisciplin-
ary program for its undergrads,
modeled after the‘ University
Honors College, said Jayant
Rajgopal, associate professor of
industrial engineering. '

“Students who want to do
something far out would have the
opportunity to explore working
across the various departments”
through the proposed program,
he said. “This newprogram has
been approved by the school, and
we’re  it to the provost [for
his approval] very soon.”

In his three years of -teaching.

 a¢odrses,c’Rajgdpa1:’sa3d a

he has seen “an incredible range”
of educational backgrounds
among the school’s incoming
undergraduates. 1
Some freshmen come with
very strong computer skills but
about 10 ‘percent of them are
comparative novices in work-

ing with computers, he said. V

“Similarly, in math preparation,
which is crucial to engineering,
some are very well prepared in
calculus and some have had no
calculus at all. , _

’ “It’s not that they’re any less
bright, but many high schools
don’t have calculus teachers,”

{Rajgopal noted. “So I think that
I one of my biggest challenges
‘ teaching freshmen is getting a

balance, feeling my way through
how to keep the bored students

’ interested while the othersrcan

still catch up..Usually, though, by
the end of the sophomore year,
there is much more equality of
math and computer efﬁciency.”

A Raj gopal said Pitt’s engineer-
ing school gets two types of fresh-
men: those ready to work hard,
and those who come expecting
that an engineering major auto-

’ matically will lead to a lucrative

career. The latter tend to get
weeded out quickly, according
to Rajgopal, who said he tells
his freshman classes: “You’ll be
the hardest-working student in
your dorm, because this program
is very difficult.”

“It doesn’t take long before
they believe me,” he said.

Daniel Budny,‘ academic
director of the engineering
school’s freshman programs,
said he and other professors have
been seeing better. analytic, writ-

ing and team—work skills among
Pitt engineering freshmen in
recent years.

“We’ve adjusted our fresh-
man curriculum to be more
sophisticated. We’ve raised the
bar, with additional challenges to
the student. But despite increased
demands, grade point averages
have increased, and retention
rates are about the same or a little
improved” over the past decade,
said Budny, an associate profes-
sor of civil and environmental
engineering. '

“I don’t thinkyou can say that

"an alum- from 10 yearsago could
not complete our program today. ’

But I think" with the improved
quality and sophistication, the
demands and challenges of the
curriculum, you now need stu-
dents who come in with a strong
willingness to work, with strong
motivation; ' I A .
“And” I’ve seen students in
my classes who also are not
afraid to fail; 'they’ll take on a
task even when they know they
can’t complete it. That shows a
mature conﬁdence that I’m not
sure was there 10 years ago.”
Results of the engineering
school’s most recent freshman
survey revealed that freshmen
averaged almost 22 hours a week
of homework, which Budny said
at least matches the homework

. load in any other ﬁeld.

. “It’s kind of thechickeli or the

 

students graduating, and as we
invest in our labs and classrooms,
we’re seeing an increase in fresh-
man applicants where Pitt is [the
applicants’] ﬁrst choice. Ten years
ago, Pitt might have been down
the list, behind Penn State, Cam-
egie Mellon and others.”

“I can say that the students
who enter our freshman program
are very bright” —- but that has
nothing to do with higher SAT

scores among incoming Pitt
‘students, said John Patzer II,

assistant professor in the Depart-
ment of Chemical and Petroleum
Engineering, who has been teach-
ing” freshmen since 1986. :
“SATs reflect how well a
number of test-takers did on a
particular day, butit says more
that their secondary education
includes teaching for these tests,”
said Patzer, who believes that
students-drilled to score well on
SATs tend to compartmentalize
knowledge rather than viewing
physics, biology, writing and
other disciplines as being part
of a comprehensive whole.
“Frankly, that is not the type
of student we want, the kind of
student who is taught well how to
take a multiple-guess testwithout
learning how to attack a problem
analytically,” he said.

A VVhathas reallyinﬂuenced the
world—view of today’s students,
and made them different from
students of a decade ago, is the
impact of technology, according
to Patzer. . s

“The Widespread use of the

A computer, the inﬂuence of the

‘M I V world,’ competitive video
'n these are all inﬂuences

gami g, ”

on the waystudents learn, Patzer

said. “Their attention span has
decreased considerably. The
students are bright, but our chal-
lenge is getting them to use their
brightness. How can we properly
motivate these students so that

they will want to work?”

Unlike Budny, Patzer says
writing skills, in particular, are
poor among Pitt engineering
students, “maybe even poorer
than a decade ago.”

Nursing

Compared  Pitt School of ‘

Nursing freshmen a decade ago,
freshmen at the school today are
making more sophisticated intel-
lectual connections between the
classroom and hospital -— seek-
ing to understand how drugs are
designed, for example, and why

a knowledge of chemistry is rel- _

evant to their future careers, said
George Bandik, who every other
year teaches a chemistry course
for freshman nursing students.
“In no way do I want to
put down the kids I was teach-
ing 10 years ago, because they
were wonderful students who
worked really hard and did what
was within their ability to do,”
said Bandik, director of under-
graduate studies in the chemistry

department and an assistant dean A

of the School ofArts' and Sciences.
“Back then, nursing students also
were coming in with a desire to

learn, but the educational system i

at the time was more about rote
memorization. Today, guidance
counselors and teachers are tell-
ing prospective nursing students:
There’s a lot more to nursing than
that.”

Bandik said he’s noticed

this ‘year, particularly, that_Pi/tt_ H M H
"nursing freshmen 'aren’t ‘co'r‘1- “ 
tent t0 learn COUTSC material‘

just for the sake of passing his
course. “Instead of coming here
with the attitude, ‘I’m afraid of
taking chemistry. I don’t want
to be here,’ they’re more likely
to say, ‘Tell me how it relates to
nursing.’ They’re asking hard-
core questions: Why are certain
drugs designed the way they are?
How do certain properties of a
drug affect its ability to cross a
cell membrane?”

Bandik said his students
don’t complain about coming
to class at 8 a.m. for a four-hour

chemistry labthat has no direct

connection with health care. .

“Another noticeable difference
over the last several years is that
a lot more students come to the
voluntary recitation sessions that
I hold” after class on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, said
Bandik. “Sometimes, out of a

class of 150 freshman nursing:

students, 70 will come to these
sessions for an additional hour,
to continue discussing -course
material.”

Jake Dechant, who teaches
anatomy and physiology courses
to nursing school freshmen, said
he’s been adding material to his
courses as students demonstrate
that they can absorb more.
“Among other things, I was

.making them learn all of the

bones of the body. Their reac-
tion was just, ‘Okay,’ and they
memorized that information, so
I went ahead and started teach-
ing in-depth about the physiol-
ogy of how bone develops. They
absorbed all of that information,
too.”

increasingly characteristic of
Pitt undergraduates,” Stewart
declared. “I knowthere are a
lot of really satisﬁed Pitt faculty
out there who are enjoying being
stimulated by students willing to
engage them in serious discourse
— basically, picking a ﬁght with
them, intellectually.”

, Two other professors said
they’re seeing some better-pre-
pared undergrads, but that Pitt
still admits plenty of students who
aren’t ready for college.

“Aml seeing an improvement
in student quality?” said physics
professor ‘Peter Koehler. “It
depends on which of my three
courses you’re talking about.”

Koehler teaches a course for
freshman engineering students,
a general introductory course
for non-science majors, and_ an
introductory sequence for pre-
med students as well as majors
from biological sciences, chem-
istry and some Health Sciences
schools.

“I certainly have encoun-
tered some very good students
in all of those courses,” Koehler
said. “Unfortunately, I’ve also
encountered students ﬁom the
other end of the spectrum. Has
the average improved? I thinkso,
although it’s not something that
blows you away. . A .

“Certainly, the exceptional
students are really exceptional;
they’re wonderful. The. prob-
lem is, the best students get
pulled out into Honors College
courses. I feel that particularly
in my course for engineering
students. Alec Stewart is fortu-
nate in getting some 30 or 40
engineering students from the
top of the group” to enroll in
his honors course for engineers.

“Those of us who teach the rest ’

of them wish we had those 30 or
40 students in our classes.”
Koehler attributed his less-
successful students’ problems
not to a lack of intelligence but,
rather, to poor study habits,
inadequate math skills and a
misunderstanding of the nature
of physics. “It has to do with the
generally poor state of science
education in the high schools,”
he said. “Students come to us
with the wrong impression that
physics is aﬁeld where you get
a formula, you plug in numbers
and you come out with an answer.

VVhen we say to these students: '

‘In physics, you develop equa-
tions from general principles,
these are the general principles
and now you’re going to have to
think’...the students are over-
whehned.”

Koehler, the immediate past
dean. of Pitt’s School of Arts
and Sciences, said he ﬁnds that
some freshmen just aren’t ready
for university life. “An SAT score
is not necessarily a good measure
of whether students can study
or handle the workload that is
thrown at them as freshmen,”
he pointed out.

“I spend a lot of time meet-
ing with students in my ofﬁce,
and much of the discussion is
about how to study, how to
get organized and how much

10

time students should devote per
week to each course. Some kids
just need that kind of parent-like
advice —— not that they would
take it from their own parents,
of course,” Koehler said with a
laugh. “I know that from having
raised kids myself. But when
someone else tells them, they
tend to listen. ‘

“It’s ..extr.eine1y ,r,e_war,di~ng'

when some of these kids really
catch ﬁre and then come back and
tellyou abouttheir successes later
in their academic careers.”

Like Koehler, biological sci-
ences professor Iain Campbell
said he regularly encounters
freshmen who didn’t receive
adequate science teaching or
mentoring in high school.

“I am completely convinced
that academic achievement is
catalyzed by committed men-
tors —— good teachers, in other
words,” said Campbell, who
volunteers to tutor undergrads
at his depart:ment’s Help Desk
in the Cathedral of Learning’s
Commons Room. '

“Help Desk sessions later in
the evening tend to get a wee bit
more philosophical and I often
ask students, ‘What turned you
on to pursue a certain intellectual
interest?’ The answer invariably
is: A person. Someone who told
them something like ‘Go read
this book,’ and that book made

an impact on their lives.

“When you get freshmen who
had at least one really inspiring
teacher in high’ school, those
are the kids who have the flame
burning already and you can
rim with it. But I suspect that
many of the students coming to
Pitt now with great SAT scores
never really encountered a great
teacher while in high school. In
fact, I’ve talked with "a lot of dis-
gruntled students who left high
school without much respect for
any of their teachers.”

Campbell said .he’s seen an
improvement in academic qual-
ity among Pitt undergrads in the
last decade “butl wouldn’t say it’s

been a major improvement,” he

added. Looking back over his 40

years of teaching here,,Campbell
concluded: “I’ve no documenta-
tion to prove ' this, but I _don’t
think there has been a signiﬁcant
change in the intellectual caliber
of undergraduates here.” _
One thing that has increased
dramatically, Campbell noted,
is the proportion of Pitt under-
graduates working one or more
outside jobs; even full.-ti‘m‘—e
jobs — consistent  another

CIDDE

national trend. “On top of this,
undergraduates today are pur-

suing internships and research

opportunities that didn’t exist
for previous generations of stu-
dents,” he said. ' ' I
“I don’t know that I could have
coped with that kind of workload
back in the 195 Os when I was_ an
undergraduate.” In his native

Scotland back then, the only

time that university students

With increasing frequency,
Dechant said, a nursing student
will askihim a question in the
middle of class “that just stops
me dead, its so insightful. I really
have to stop and think of how to
answer. You think students are
dozing off or not paying atten-
tion, and suddenly one of them

' comes out with something like

that. . ..” I
Last fall, Pitt’s nursing school
received 800‘_applications for
100 ﬁ-eshmen slots, said Associ-
ate Dean Susan Albrecht. The
average, combined SAT score

I among admitted freshmen was

1165, up from 1109 the year
before; 75 percent graduated in
the top 20 percentof their high
school classes, up from 66 percent
the year before.

“ Susan and I have been nurses
for a long time,” saidjacqueline
Lever, the nursing school’s
executive director of student ser-
vices. “We know that part of the
reason the school is getting more
applications and student quality

is improving is market-driven-

With today’s nursing shortage
and Pitt’s growing reputation,
our graduates can work any-
where in the country and make
nice money.” As upperclassmen,
most Pitt nursing students take
advantage of career ‘opportuni-
ties within the UPMC or the
city’s other health care systems.

“And these systems will accom-
modate [the students’] academic
schedules — letting them work
four-hour shifts instead of eight-
hour shifts, for example —— in the
hope of recruiting them after they
graduate.” 4 -

, But the school’s increasing V

selectivity and- student quality
also can be attributed to better
preparation by students and the

changing image ofnurses, she and '

I Albrecht agreed. ,
“We’re been_ working very
hard over the last 10 years to get
the word out to guidance coun-
selors, parents and prospective
students that if you want to be
accepted into Pitt’s baccalaureate
program, you need tobe taking
strong academic courses in high
school such as advanced chemis-
‘try and biology,” said Lever.
Albrecht noted that nurses
today are earning greater respect
as health care professionals and
critical thinkers. “Today, when a
patient’s blood pressure changes
or‘ the pulse shoots up, nurses
aren’t just running and calling for
a physician. They’re expected to
make decisions and take appro-
priate action themselves,” Albre-
cht said. I
Dechant commented: “I think
today we’re getting a number of
students who, inyears past, would
have enrolled in majors like pre-
med. My students know that

were supposed to have jobs was
during summer breaks, Campbell
recalled.

The biological sciences
professor lamented what he
described as “a decrease inthe
intellectual breadth of entering
students. This is not a Pitt-spe-
ciﬁc thing; I thinkit’s true nation-
wide. Even 10 years ago, I could
easily use analogies culled from
Shakespeare or some non-science
area in teaching my biology or
biochemistry courses, but not
anymore. A lot of the students
today wouldn’t understand what
I was talking about.”

Having helped to coach Pitt
Marshall and Rhodes scholars,
Campbell has ﬁrst—hand expe-
rience with what he calls “the
really intellectually engaged
and prepared” students that the
Universityis enrollingin growing
numbers.

“But that’s still such a small
fraction of the undergraduate
population,” he noted. “At the
other extreme, I’ve had some
really ‘iffy students in the fresh-
man studies courses I’ve taught
over the last 2 0 years,” Campbell

said. “I don’t think the proportion

has changed all that much.
“When I say ‘iffy,’ I’m not
talking about students who
are shy or under—pre”pared,”
he explained. “Essentially, I’m
talking about students who

don’t have an awful lot to say .

about anything, who seem ‘to be

. very shallow vessels. I never call

into question a vessel that is deep
but empty because I know we can
ﬁll it. It’s the shallow ones who
worry me. And I’m afraid we’re
still getting a lot of very shallow

nursing isn’t just about changing
bedpans or whatever. They know
that if they enroll here, they can
explore various career -options
including advanced practice.

“I see it in the way they apply.
themselves to their studies,”
Dechant continued. “They’re
coming here because they want
to be nurses, not because they

V couldn’t pass Calculus 2 and so

they settled on nursing because
they co11ldn’t get into a pre—med
program. I don’t see our students
bowing down anymore to that
idea that the physician is the
almighty positigi to aspire to.”

The last word on Pitt’s ‘

increasing selectivity goes to
Dechant, who earned a B.A.
degree in anthropology and a
master’s degree in biological

anthropology at’ Pitt, and is

working on a Ph.D. in epidemi-
ology at the Graduate School of
Public Health. His wife, also a
Pitt graduate, is starting a‘ doc-
toral program here, too. .1

I “The other night, mywife said
to me: ‘Do you realize that, with
our SAT scores and class ranks, we
wouldn’t even be looked at by Pitt
today if we were applying right
out of high school?’ Dechant

, recounted, with a chuckle.

“It was kind of uncomfortable
to acknowledge, but it’s true.”

Minority health center gets $2 milliongrant

The Center for Minority
Health ,(CMH), part of the
Graduate School of Public
Health, has received more than
$2 million from the Pennsylvania
Department of Health to provide
statewide technical assistance to
ethnic, racial and disparate popu-
lations, primary contractors and
service providers to establish
tobacco cessation programs.

This continues a contract
between the Department of
Health and CMH, which has
been in effect since 2001 and
comes from the tobacco settle-
ment fund for the Pennsylvania
Tobacco Prevention Clearing-'
house.

CMH has been awarded
$2,062,150 for the period Janu-
ary 2004-June 2006 to continue
its efforts to work with both the
primary contractors and the ’
identiﬁed priority populations

‘to ensure that tobacco use pre-

vention and cessation education,
service and funding become a
reality for underserved Penn-
sylvanians.

Stephen B. Thomas, direc-
tor of CMH and Philip Hallen
Professor of Community Health
and Social Justice, said: “This is
onekey element in our mission
to eliminate health disparities
by 2010.” .

The purpose of the clear-
inghouse is to provide statewide

Through the contract with
CMH, a diverse and inclusive
workgroup will assist in a stra-

a comprehensive strategic plan
that will provide a framework for
future programs, interventions
and surveillance and evaluation
associated with tobacco-related
disparities. '

The clearinghouse also will:

iThis will include the develop-

ment of a cultural competency
assessment tool that will be made
available to primary contractors
and service providers to enhance
their programs, which are geared
toward disparate‘ populations.

° Create. a scholarship for
minority scholars who are basing
their master’s thesis or doctoral
dissertation on tobacco preven-
tion and control, tobacco policy
or campus—based tobacco use

interventions.

Recipients of the scholarships A

will present ﬁndings to Depart-

RESEARCH NOTES‘ I

Volcanologist
uses satellite
images to help
predict
eruptions

Each day, planes en route
between North America and Asia
carry more than 10,000 people
and $1 million worth of cargo
over the active volcanoes of the
Aleutian Arc. Clouds of ash can
wreak havoc on the engines of
these airplanes, which fly in one
of the world’s busiest air-trade
routes.

ManyAleutianArcvolcanoes,
because of their remoteness and
volatility, have been challenging
for volcanologists to study. With-
out access to the volcanoes, scien-
tists have had trouble predicting
the volcanoes’ behavior.

Assistant professor Michael
Ramsey’s research has conﬁrmed
that detailed information about
remote volcanoes now can be
accessed from space, based on
infrared mapping by satellite.
Ramsey, director of Pitt’s Image
Visualization and Infrared
Spectroscopy laboratory in the

Department of Geology and

Planetary Sciences, presented.

his ﬁndings at the December
meeting of the American Geo-
physical Union.

Volcanologists predict the
behavior of volcanoes by ana-

lyzing the mineral composition ,

of rock. Until now, researchers
worked from the ground, taking
samples from the volcanoes
themselves. But Ramsey used the

Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
Emission and Reﬂection Radi-
ometer (ASTER), an imaging
instrument aboard NASA’s
satellite Terra, to examine rock
composition.

ASTER combines three imag-
ing technologies -— visible/near
infrared, short-Wave infrared and
thermal infrared — to obtain high
resolution maps of land surface
temperature, emissivity, reﬂec-

tance, and elevation. Ramsey
matched ASTER images with
samples of rock from a volcano
in the Aleutian Arc, conﬁrming
the images’ accuracy.

“With ASTER, we can
observe changes weekly,” said
Ramsey. “This is very impor-
tant after the initial eruption
and the formation of a lava
dome. These act likeicorks in
many ways, and subtle changes
in their temperature, composi-
tion or texture reveal information
about potential eruptions.”

Ramsey and researchers from
the University of Alaska Fair-
banks and the Alaska Volcano
Observatory did their research at
Black Peak, an inactive volcano
on the Alaskan Peninsula that had
never been visited. Using satel-
lite images and global positioning
systems to locate two areas with
differing rock compositions, they
traveled to the regions by helicop-
ter and took rock samples. The
composition of the rock samples
matched the predicted composi-
tion of the satellite images, which
had been imaged in blocks of 90
square meters.

Because of the success of
this research, Ramsey recently

was appointed a full member
of the ASTER science team and
received a $600,000 grant from
NASA to help automate com-
munication between existing
volcano» monitoring systems.
Currently, weather satellites that
monitor Aleutian Arc volcanoes
are operated by the Alaska Vol-
cano Observatory and ASTER
is controlled by NASA. If the
two are programmed to work
together, emergency data can
be taken more efﬁciently and
could improve preparations for
disasters. V

“We are hoping to have the
satellites talk to one another and
cut out a lot of the time spent on
human interaction,” said Ramsey.
“This project also looks to expand
beyond volcanoes in Alaska to
other areas and other natural
disasters around the world.”

Engineering
professor ‘ gets
research
fellowship

_ at Oxford

Pitt engineering professor I

Arma Balazs recently received

a three—year renewable award.

to collaborate with research-
ers at the Oxford Centre for
Advanced Material and Com-
posites (OCANIAC) at Oxford
University.

“This fellowship will give
me an excellent opportunity to

‘strengthen existing collabora-

tions and initiate additional
ones in new areas,” said Balazs,
the Robert Von der Luft Profes-
sor in the engineering school’s

Department of Chemical and '

Petroleum Engineering. .
At Oxford, Balazs willwork
with researchers in materials

..science and physics to deter-

mine the behavior of complex
ﬂuids ﬂowing in microchannels.
This research has applications in
the ﬁeld of microﬂuidics. In addi-
tion, she will workvvith research-
ers ‘in physics to understand the
fundamental physics that controls
friction, wear and lubrication
between such sliding surfaces as
gears in machinery. _

At Pitt, Balazs has examined
how nanoparticles, like nano-
tubes, interact with polymer
mixtures. Her ﬁndings could
lead to the formation of better
electrical pathways in insulating
materials or to the creation of
continuous inorganic ‘networks
that provide signiﬁcant mechani-
cal reinforcement of soft organic
materials. ,

Balazs earned a Ph.D. in
1981 at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in materials sci-
ence and engineering.

In 1987, she joined Pitt as
an assistant professor in the
Department of Materials Science
and Engineering. She moved to
the Department of Chemical
and Petroleum Engineering in
1997.,

OCANIAC is sponsored bythe
departments of materials, engi-
neering, chemistry and physics
at Oxford University. The center
aims to unlock research potential
across sponsoring agencies and
other university departments
by stimulating research activity
_within the university and with

results to the national and inter-
national. materials community,
and to deliver integrated techni-
cal solutions to industry. ' I

he Staff Association
Council (SAC), through
' Pitt’s Student Health Ser-

’ vice, is offering cardiopulmonary

resuscitation (CPR) training
classes for Pitt employees.

' Jim Lyle, chair of the SAC
safety. and ‘ security comrr1ittee,
reported Jan. 14 that employ-
ees can sign up for any of four
courses:

° The health care provider
course, which covers adult,
child and infant CPR training,
coupled with choking response
care for those groups and use of
the automatic external deﬁbril-
lator (AED) device. Thecourse
is designed primarily for people
planning careers in the health
care field and lasts approxi-
mately six hours. The cost is
$30 per person. . —

° The heart saver course,
designed for lay rescuers, covers
adult, child and infant CPR and
foreign body airway obstruction.
The course lasts about four hours
and costs $20.

0 The heart saver AEDI

course covers similar content
to the above course, plus proper
use of the AED. The course
lasts approximately four hours
and costs $25 .

These three courses also dis-

cuss disease and injury preven-
tion, as well as tips for healthy

    

Contact Lyle at 4-6218 or
lyle@engn.pitt.edu by Feb. 16.
Courses require a minimum of
four enrollees.

The courses will be taught
by certified American Heart
Association instructors at the
Student Health Service, Suite
500 Medical Arts Building.

Ronald Bennett, Pitt campus
police officer, demonstrated
the use of the AED at the SAC
meeting. All campus police cars
are equipped with an AED, and
the devices are wall-mounted
in select areas of the campus,

4 including most computer labs

and the Petersen.Events Center,
Bennett said. Although operat-
ing instructions for the AED are
self-explanatory, people without
CPR training should not use the
device, he cautioned.

Ron Frisch, associate vice
chancellor for  Resources,
said Pitt’s goal eventually is to
equip each building on campus
with at least one AED. But the
cost per device is between $2 ,5 00
and $5,000, so the Universitywill
add to its inventory gradually,
he said. “The ﬁrst step in any
emergency always is to call an
emergency response number”
(811 from any campus phone;
911 from other phones), Frisch
maintained. “All our campus
ofﬁcers are trained in emergency

safety initiatives. The safety and
security committee is represented
on the University Senate’scom—
munity relations committee
working group examining pedes-
trian safetyissues. (Seeﬁm. 8 Uni-
versity Times.) “I have forwarded
the data we’ve collected” to the
working group and to the city,
including individual complaints
from staff and photographic
documentation of dangerous
areas, Lyle said.

The mayor’s ofﬁce now has
assigned a contact person to track
Pitt’s complaints to the city’s

trafﬁc engineering department, A

which handles trafﬁc and pedes-
trian safety issues, he said. “John
Tokarski]r., who is project coor-
dinator of [the city’s] Operation
Weed & Seed project, will keep us
informed on the status of the city’s
response to various areas we have
flagged,” such as those with poor
signage, unpainted cross-walks
and areas that need re-paving or
other maintenance. '

Staff may submit complaints
directly to Lyle or on-line via the
SAC web site: www.engr.pitt.edu/
safety&security/.

In other SAC developments:

° Ann Ostroski, chair of the
research and information com-

_ mittee, reported on efforts to
promote professional develop-
ment for staff members.

Currently, Ostroski is gath-
ering opinions on what training
classes are needed and related
issues. Staff can contact her at
628A Crabtree; 8-9417; e—mail:
aostroski@gsphdean.gsph.pitt
.edu.

Ostroski said her committee
wants to improve access to staff
training; to educate staff mem-
bers on alternative training and
development options, including
workshops, classes and certiﬁcate
programs; to ensure that release
time is granted according to

University policies, and to make '

recommendations to Pitt’s
administration on viable train-

distributed at SAC meetings
and through articles in the SAC
Tracks newsletter and other Pitt
publications, Ostroski said.

° SAC is supporting a winter
hat and glove drive, initiated by
SAC member Linda Howard.
The drive will beneﬁt a McK-
eesport-based shelter for abused
women and their children. “Most
of these people are in transit and
so the shelter has a constant turn-
over,” Howard said. “Many of the
women are in hiding and move
around quite a bit. We’d like to
provide them and the children
with some winter gear when
they leave the shelter.”

Donations of new winter hats,
gloves and scarves, as well as used
items in good condition, should
go to Howard at 416 CL by Feb.
13. For more information, con-
tact Howard at 4-6608.
