GARYFRIEDMAN/Los ANGELES TIMES

Fireﬁghters and rescue workers search the rubble of America Airlines Flight 587, which crashed in a New York neighbor-
hood yesterday, killing all 260 aboard and leaving several people on the ground unaccounted for.

Plane crashesin Queens

BETH HOLLAND
N ewsday

NEW YORK —- A jetliner with 260
people aboard plummeted into Queens,
N.Y. Monday, killing all aboard and leaving

at least six people missing in Belle Harbor, 2

a neighborhood still torn by grief from the
World Trade Center tragedy.
On a crystalline November - morning,

American Airlines Flight 587 — bound for,

the Dominican Republic" and running more
than 70 minutes late — took off from John
F. Kennedy Airport at 9:14 a.m. and
crashed three minutes later, destroying at
least six houses and damaging about six
others in the cozy enclave called home by

- generationsof Irish and Jewish families.

Authorities did not deﬁnitively rule out
terrorism as the crash’s» cause. But by
Monday night, a senior Bush administra-
tion official said, ‘‘It’s looking like it’s not a
terrorist attac .”.

Marion Blakey, chairwoman of the
National Transportation Safety Board,
agreed, noting, “All information we have
currently is that this is an accident.”

Many in the area said they witnessed
the plane’s demise. “I heard a plane that
didn’t sound right. It was rumbling,” said

I Susan Locke, publisher of The Wave news-

- paper in Rockaway Beach. “I looked out of

.__

 

the window, and I saw the silver front of the
plane nose—dive to the ground.

“Then,” she said, “plrunes of black
smoke were everywhere.”

Some barely escaped death when the
plane crashed, as dangerous debris scat-
tered across a wide area. _ 5

Residents of the Rockaways, still deep
in mourning for the scores of ﬁreﬁghters
and other residents of the peninsula who
perished in the World Trade Center attacks,
could hardly believe their eyes.

’ “Oh, God, it was so horrible,” said
Eileen Dolan, who was headed home after
walking her dog on the beach. “There were
ﬂames. There were ﬂames coming out of
the plane, and then it fee .” 2

Later, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would
say in a news conference that all aboard the
plane were believed dead, while at least six
people on the ground, and perhaps as many
as eight, were dead,-He noted that while he
didn’t want to ‘fminirrrize” the crash, it
could have “been far worse — even the
way in which the plane landed in one
deﬁned area”  the damage, he
said.

Meanwhile, Roberto Valentin, a

«Dominican ambassador at large, said he

believed 90 percent of Flight 587’s passen-
gers were Dominican, headed to their

_ native land.

Air‘ trafﬁc control sources said there
was no indication from the cockpit that
anything was wrong. Controllers lost radar
Contact with Flight 587 at 9:17 a.m., when
it was traveling at 2,800 feet and 266 knots
— a slightly higher speed than authorized
at that low altitude. \

“Everything seemed nonnal, and there
was no indication on anybody’s frequency

that anything was wrong,” one source said.

Fighter jets ﬂying round—the—clock
patrols over New York City, as well as a
military surveillance plane, did not pick up

any distress calls from the plane, a

Pentagon source said. _
At a late-aftemoon brieﬁng at the

» Ramada Inn, where hundreds of family

members of those on board gathered to

learn about the crash, Giuliani said 240 I

bodies had been recovered, and that it was
not yet known how many were passengers
aboard Flight 587, and how many were
Belle ' Harbor residents. Police later
increased the number of bodies recovered
to 253. '

There were 246 ticketed passengers‘

and nine crew members on the American
Airlines ﬂight. Monday night, airline ofﬁ—
cials said ﬁve infants also were on the jet,
traveling on people’s laps as allowed under

culates the damp air. The residents,
Lindsay Rowe and Lauren
Burkhart, sit at their computers
while the room continues to dry and
neighbors pop their heads in to ask
for air freshener.

According to the women, they
were hanging clothes in their room
Sunday night when Rowe ran out of
space. Using the door as a
makeshift coat rack, she. said she
began to hang something on the top

of the door when her hand hit a

sprinkler near the doorjamb.

The jarring motion_ caused the '

sprinkler to ‘burst, emitting a
“funny” smelling water, according

’ to Burkhart.

That smell turned out to be
chemicals in the sprinkler water.

The fire alarm went off with the
sprinkler and water ﬂooded Room
1913 and spread outward, down the
hall, seeping into other rooms. The
girls ran down the hall to get their
resident assistant.

“By the time we shut the door it
was already ﬂooding out, literally
ﬂooding,” Burkhart said.

As the alarm sounded, the build-
ing emptied. The RA later filled out
an incident report for the girls.

According to the women, when
they were allowed back into their
room, all of their clothes were
soaked and tinted brown. The mat-
tresses were soaked through and the
carpet had begun to buckle.

“When we got back it was
drenched,” Rowe said.

The University provided those
affected most by the sprinklers with

housing at the Wyndham Garden.

“We’re keeping our eyes open for
future leaders,” CWO President
Andrea DeChe1lis said.

GROW ‘educated students about
how ‘to successfully and efficiently
organize and mobilize their organiza-
tions as “direct action organizations.”
Students learned ways to win concrete
improvements in people’s lives,
learned more about their own poten-
tial power and also dealt with ways to

0 ‘alter the relations of power.

“This information is more impor-
tant and relevant than what you’ll
learn in most of the classes you’ll
take,” said GROW student trainer
Daria Karetnikov, a student at the

—Ui1iversity of Illinois at Champaigh.

“It’s about how to change and

. improve your own lives.”

The 2 1/2-day program utilized
active student participation through-

role-playing scenarios. The trainers
emphasized building coalitions
among student organizations and
within the community, while also
focusing on identifying issues, strate-
gies, recruitment and action.

“I think that it strengthened my
general organizing and recruitment
ability,” said senior Cara Harley, a

‘ member of Students for Reproductive

Freedom and. Pitt’s Neuroscience
Club. .
GROW also informed students

0 about USSA, the group that brought
GROW to Pitt. USSA is the nationfsr

oldest and largest student organiza-
tion. In the past, USSA protested
racism, segregation and the Vietnam
War, and spoke out on behalf of
women, minorities and people of low

' socioeconomic status. The organiza-

tion ‘now represents more than 3.5

across the nation. _

“Overall, it was a positive experi-
ence,” Harley said. “It was a big time
commitment, ' but- positive as a
whole.”

FAA regulations.
The Airbus A-300, which had been

cleared to climb to 13,000 feet, followed its '

normal ﬂight path upon takeoff, heading
northeast and then making a wide arc to the
west and south.

At this point, witnesses reported hear-
ing one or two explosions before the crash.

Others said they heard little if any noise. ’

Some saw ﬂames; others did not.

The city, on a state of high alert since
the Sept. 11 trade center attacks, scrambled
immediately in response to the jetliner

crash. Giuliani, who learned of the crash

three to four minutes after it occurred, tele-
phoned President Bush.

Authorities, meanwhile, took irnmedi-_

ate emergency action.

The Federal Aviation Administration
suspended ﬂights at Kennedy, LaGuardia
and Newark airports, as well as smaller area
airports, and the city’s bridges and tunnels
were closed. In midtown, the Empire State
Building — now the city’s tallest structure
— was evacuated and later closed for the
day.

The United Nations, where the General
Assembly is in session, was partially locked
down. Even as reports of the crash came in,
Secretary-General Koﬁ Annan continued to
meet with leaders about Afghanistan.

_ A spokesman for the North American
Aerospace Defense Command said com-
manders scrambled ﬁghter jets to patrol the
skies over parts of the United States imme-
diately after the crash.

Additional planes were sent into the
skies over the city, joining those aloft on
round-the-clock‘ patrol since the Sept. 11
terror attacks. ’

The scrambled planes returned to base 0

after several hours and, by 1:30 p.m., near-
ly all of the emergency measures had been
lifted. Bridges and tunnels again were open
to traffic, and the FAA lifted ﬂight restric-
tions at the airports, except for continuing to

’ ban departures from Kennedy.

plane and other debris.

One larger piece of the plane pulled
from Jamaica Bay, initially believed to be a
wing, was the plane’s vertical stabilizer,
authorities said.

Gov. George Pataki said there were
“conﬂicting” reports that the pilot had
dumped fuel before the crash. But an
Airbus spokesman, Mark Luginbill, said
the plane was not capable of dumping fuel.

FAA records show the Airbus A—300
series with 47 reports of service difﬁculty
reports, involving engine troubles, since
1990..

In at least four instances, an" engine
failed or caught ﬁre during takeoﬁ”.Inaﬁfth
case, an engine ﬁre started after the plane

pushed back from terminal. And in a sixth
event, a takeoff was aborted because of
“overspeed” on the engine, which was sub-
sequently replaced. In each of those cases,
the Airbus was equipped with a GE CF-6
engine, the same make reportedly of the
engine of the plane that crashed into

Queens.
Patrick Sullivan, a retired police oﬂicer

. and resident of Breezy Point, another

Rockaway neighborhood that lost scores of
residents in the trade center catastrophe,
was driving with a ﬁiend when they spotted

' smoke.

“I looked down the street and saw the
engine,” said Sullivan, whose 28-year-old
son, also named Patrick, is missing in the

Sept. 11 attack on theltrade center.
Sullivan jumped from his car and
began running from house to house, knock-

ing on doors. “It was an inferno,” he said. if

Five to six wood—frarne homes were
engulfed in ﬂames.

But winds off the ocean pushed ﬁre
and smoke away from remaining homes,
allowing ﬁreﬁghters to-move in close, he
said. Construction workers at a nearby
work site came to help as ﬁreﬁghters
unfurled their hoses. ‘

The mood among those rescuers,
Sullivan said, seemed different than that of
recent weeks. “After the Twin Towers,” he
said, “this one was something they could
ﬁght.” ’ ‘

It was Sept. 11 all over again.

Or so it felt Monday morning after
American Airlines ﬂight 587 crashed at 9: 17

America had deja vu as the events eeri-

or at their oﬂices. .

We gathered around our TV sets to see
plumes of gray smoke rising over Queens,
N.Y. and to hear eyewitness accounts.
People described hearing explosions and
seeing the plane crash. New York closed its
airports, bridges and tunnels. American
Airlines conﬁrmed 260 people on the plane.
Six people were unaccounted for on the
ground.

VVith all of its scary similarity, some of
us even  ourselves for reports of a
second plane crash or of other missing
planes. We quietly prepared ourselves to
relive Sept. llth’s terror. We thought to our-
selves, “here we go again.”

All many could do was hope, as one
man on TV did aloud, that the incident was
an accident, as awful as such a hope was.

In the hours following, no facts surfaced

Plane crash rekindles Sept. 11 fears  

to clearly show that the crash was an act of
terrorism. Until the NI‘SB and the FBI
release their ﬁndings, we must keep in mind
that, despite natural human tendencies
toward speculation, rumors and conjectures
are just that — manifestations of an anxious,
even slightly paranoid population trying to
cope in uncertain times. . _

There may be little way to soothe our
frazzled nerves. The crash couldn’t have
happened at a worse time — for America’s

sense of security, our faith in our ability to ﬂy ‘

safely or the airline industry and its ﬁnancial
stability. With Thanksgiving travel quickly
approaching, many may reconsider their
plans to ﬂy. Some may feel that this latest
event has cemented the belief that things will
never be the same. Others wony about the
economy, particularly soon-to-be graduates
concerned about getting jobs.

Nonetheless, rather than _letting our ini-
tial fears spiral out of control, we should
allow ourselves to be increasingly relieved
by the fact that no early indicators have
pointed to terrorism. In fact, some eyewit-
ness reports offer accounts consistent with
mechanical failure. Though“ circumstances
remain unclear and many lives have been
lost, we should remind ourselves that
Monday was not a repeat of Sept. 11. In
these uneasy times, we must seek comfort
wherever it can be found.

BAS comedy show act insulting,
disrespectful to Sept. 11 victims

TAI SAUNDERS
The Pitt News

With the help of comedians such as

’ Jay Leno and David Letterman, the nation

started to laugh again, two months after the
devastating attacks on New York and
Washington, D.C. But last Friday night at
BAS’ annual talent show, that all came to a
crashing end for me. As the last contestant
in the show, Jermaine “One Eye” was list-
ed in the program as a comedian, but
stepped out on stage with no jokes, only
anger.

. First, the so-called comedian insulted
the audience by calling us “broke-ass col-
lege students” and by gratuitously swear-
ing. When the audience disapproved of his
“humor,” he began to rant that Osarna bin
Laden was his cousin arid that he could
page him and blow the room up. “One
Eye” proceeded to walk around the audi-
ence and to threaten‘ to ﬁll our campus mail
with anthrax. ' ,

As I sat in my seat, wide-eyed and jaw

dropped open in shock, I thought it could '

not get any worse.
_ I was wrong.

It went from being terrible to personal
as “One Eye” made statements about the
victims on the planes that crashed in the
attacks, causing my outrage to turn into a
ﬁght to hold back tears. .

My cousin, Bernard Brown Jr., was a
passenger on American Airlinesﬂight 77,
the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.
He was only 11 years old.

I admit that I did not know him, but I
mourn his death like that of a close family
member, witnessing how his death killed a
piece of each of my family members, near

. . . . _ . . . - — - - . . . . , . . V . _

I and far.

I remember hearing my mother snif-
ﬂing as she relayed the sad news in a voice
mail on my cell phone as I walked down
Fifth Avenue. I can still hear the strong and
proud black wofnan who raised me single
handedly cry uncontrollably on the phone
when I called her back, as I silently sat cov-
ering the phone receiver, trying to not
alarm my mother with my ﬂowing tears.
My grandmother —_— the only grandparent
I’ve ever known and one of the people I
cherish the most —- and other family mem-
bers were also audibly shaken when I
talked to them. I will long hold on to a card
written in the visibly shaken handwriting of
my cousin, Bemard’s mother. '

“One Eye” reawakened this sense of
sadness in me and in my family when I told
them about what transpired at the show.

Saturday felt like Sept. 12 all over
again as I silently walked around campus
in shock and disbelief about what I had
seen the night before. My weekend was
mined. ‘ —

“One Eye’s” performance was not in
the least bit funny, thankfully evidenced by
the people that stood up and booed and the
prompt return to the stage by the MCs.“

What I do ﬁnd ironic is the fact that
someone who takes his name from the fact
thatlhe covers his bad eye with an eye patch
and is hardly a candidate for GQ’s Man of
the Year, is a person who maliciously
makes fun of others. ‘ ‘

I don’t know what drove him to do
this. I don’t care. It’s totally uncalled for.

I don’t want an apology from “One
Eye.” I believe he will get what he deserves

You can go home again. VV1th buses, trains, planes,
cars or whatever other form of transportation mentioned in
Richard Scarry books to carry you there, it is physically
possible to return to your place of origin. Unless ﬁre, ﬂood
or biblical plague dissolved the residence of your youth
during midterrns, it will probably be there waiting for you.

A conundrum faces both ﬁrst-time pilgrims and expe-
rienced joumeymen alike — will home be as you remem-
bered it?

I went back to »my castle in the boondocks" of
Washington, D.C., last weekend.

My mode of transportation: a Honda Accord piloted
by a fellow D.C. native that sped over the black ribbon of
Pennsylvania tumpike. My destination: the Edwardian
house that I’ve called home since I was nine months old’.
My expectation: to ﬁnd life as I left- it — with its small
miseries and great joys, delicate but preserved, like some
miniature ship in a bottle.

Despite these expectations, life was different. For
instance, my younger sister took up residence in my room
leaving me with a smaller, east-facing room, painted a suf-
focating pink — that my mom insists is actually apricot —
where the dawn light would wake
me. I

 the ﬁnality that standing in the main corridor

changes without _a familiar yardstick and my

BAS responsible for allowing offensive talentshow act

A sometime in this life and in the next.

But Black Action Society is another

story. I hold BAS accountable for the

mishap on Friday. Without a doubt, “One
Eye” disrespected the audience, the Pitt
community and the nation. BAS disre-
spected these same people when they
allowed “One Eye” to set one foot on the
stage. ’ i _ _

. For four years, my ﬁiends and I have
attended BAS functions and some things
‘have been shocking before, but nothing 0
this caliber. .

Who approved of him and felt he was
competent of making a joke? Who was so
desperate to ﬁll in a spot that they felt he
was their only choice? Whoorganized this
show and did not remember last year’s

_ comedy show — a show where the great

Cyclops himself, following a slew of
hacks, created a stampede as the audience
cleared the auditorium of David Lawrence
Hall only 30 minutes after the show began?

I didn’t forget that night. I remembered
it when I saw “One Eye” walking around at
the talent show. So, who couldn’t put the

connection of “not funny then” and “not A

funny now” together?

BAS, that’s who. BAS, the organiza-
tion that is supposed to bring the sistas and
brothas of Pitt together, abandoned us as
soon as they put “One Eye’s” name in print.

Many of the black students at Pittare
from either three places: Philadelphia, New
York or the Washington metro area. The

areas that were attacked were represented’

in the audience strongly that night. “One
Eye” unsympathetically attacked these
people, including me, and BAS gave him
the means to do it. Everyone who lost his or
her life, survived, knew or loved somebody
on Sept. 11 was disrespected.

BAS owes me the 2 ‘1/2 hours of my

life that I blew watching the talent show in
the assembly room of the Union. They owe
me the? weekend I spent outraged and
mourning instead of focusing on my
schoolwork. - _
They owe my family and all others still

mourning their deepest sympathies. They .

owe the audience, the Pitt community and
me full apologies. ' _
But then again, what do I know, I’m

just a “broke-ass college student?” Right, _

“One Eye?”

looking to beat Pitt and rested for the meet.
“It was actually a compliment that they were
looking forward to swimming us _and were
so prepared,” Knoles said.

The Panthers’ women’s basketball
team put themselves in good position for
their upcoming season, with a lopsided
100-49 victory over M.I. Express in an
exhibition contest.

M.I. Express, a conglomeration of g

leges such as Old Dominion and Norfolk
State, could not get started early.

The Panthers opened up to an 18-4
lead over the traveling. team, with 13:42

coach Michael Ivy called two timeouts to

try to regroup his players but to no avail. ~

Cross Country has best season ever

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

in

With or without last weekend’s
NCAA regional meet at Lehigh
University, the women’s cross
country team already put together
its best season ever.

But the women ran last weekend
and didn’t disappoint head coach
Waddie Freeman when three
Panthers finished in the top 50 for
the first time.

“We’ve only had three runners
in our history finish in thetop 50
before this weekend,” Freeman
said.

On top of that, the team finished
in eighth place and ranked in the
top 10 in the East region, team bests
by far. ’

Until senior Amanda Schmidt
crossed the finish line in 28th place,
Angie Martin was the only women’s

runner to finish in the top 50 at the ,

regional for Pitt since 1994.
Schmidt completed the 6,000-meter
course in 21 minutes, 51.87 sec-
onds.

It was a fitting end to the season
for Schmidt, who has been Pitt’s
best runner all season.

“Her finish was the best ever by

a Pitt women’s runner,”
said.  . ‘  »
" ' wtien all is said and done,
Schmidt" will probably go down as
the best cross country runner to put
on a Panther uniform, but she’s not
done yet.

Schmidt has one year of eligi-

Freeman

bility left and will run next year

while attending graduate school. _A
Freshman Lauren Shaffer has
plenty of time left to improve, but is

already leaving her mark on the

program.

Shaffer finished 33rd with a
time of 21:59.50, Pitt’s third best
finish ever.

Maureen McCandless, another
freshman, closed out her first Pitt
campaign strong despite some
injuries’, placing 40th with a time of
22:16.96.

“She’s not even 100 percent and
she still had a great race,” Freeman
said. _

Senior Beth Rocks was’ Pitt’s
fourth runner in her last collegiate
race, placing 64th with a time of
22:37.92.

With the cross country season
over, Rocks will concentrate on the
800-meter race, in which she was a
national qualifier last season.

- Freshman Jessica Johnson saved

her best for last and cracked Pitt’s

top five for the "first time this sea-

son, ‘finishing with a time of
23:23.40 in 96th place.

“Much improved sophomore
Dawn Hilgert, who dealt.with some
injuries of her own, came in 118th
with a time of 23:50.37.

“They’ve been very consistent,”
Freeman said. “Nobody really had a
bad race all year.”

For the men’s team, just getting
to the regional meet showed how
much it improved this season.

“This is the first time the men’s
team has been to the NCAA region-
als in four years,” Freeman said.

The men finished 20th and took
revenge in the process.

,« “We lost‘ to Marshall and
Rutgers earlier in the year,”
Freeman said, “but we beat those
teams this week.”

The freshmen were just as cru-
cial to the men’s team as they were
to the women’s all season as fresh-
man Darrell Curtis was Pitt’s top
finisher again this week.

Curtis finished the 10,000-
meter race, the first time that dis-
tance was used this season, in 98th
place with a time of 32:58.12.
Freshman Nick‘ Westerman’s
33:14:35 finish was good enough

for 109th.

A few sophomores closed out
Pitt’s top five. Dan Hull was 122nd
with a time of 33:36.85. Mike
Diano took 126th (33:47.93). Clint
Kotuby was 138th (34:03.44).'

Many young runners received
valuable experience as there wasn’t
an upperclassman in the nucleus of

‘the-men’s team this year, and

Freeman knows the team still needs
a few years to reach its full poten-
tial. . ' «n
“The team basically consists of
two freshmen and three sopho-
mores,” Freeman said. “We’ve got a

‘lot to build on.”

Both teams have a lot to be
proud of, but they don’t have much
time to dwell on it, since the indoor
track season begins this Thursday,
with Pitt’s annual Blue-Gold meet
at th‘e.Fitzgerald Field House.

With some of his cross country
members a little beat up from the
long season, Freeman is still up in
the air about who will be running
which events on Thursday.

“You don’t really get much of a
break between the cross country,
indoor and outdoor seasons,”
Freeman said. “But I feel we’re
going to have a great indoor track
season.” ' *

The Pitt News

The women’s swimming and diving
team displayed great strength against
Rutgers on Friday, losing to the Scarlet
Knights by 19 points.

The Lady Panthers swam a number
of best times for the season and despite
the Big East Conference loss, proved
themselves to be a very competitive team
against a "strong conference rival.

Pitt’s 200-yard medley relay team,
made of sophomores Carolyn Savini,
Ryan Redman, Jenny Livingstone and
freshman Katie Nicholson, won the
meet’s first event, with a time of 1:46.62
and set a very aggressive for the compe-
tition.

‘Savini led the team with two indi-
vidual wins. Her first win came in the
100—yard backstroke, with a time of just
more than 59 seconds.,Savini also won
the 200-yard backstroke (2:04.45), as
well as ﬁnishing second in the 200-yard
individual medley. .

Redman had a strong swim in the

. 100 breastroke (:1 :04.04) and was fol-
lowed by her teammate Kristina De\?V1tt

who placed second. DeW"1tt then edged
out Redman in the 200-yard breastroke,
with a time of 2:23.93. '

Junior Emily Colley had notable-

swims in the distance events, placing sec-
ond in both the 500-yard freestyle
(4257.99) and 1000-yard freestyle
(10:l4.19). Rutgers’s Big East
Champion Erin McIntyre defeated
Colley in both events, but only out-swam
Colley by 1.08 seconds in the 500-yard
freestyle.»

Pitt’s women divers held strong,
with wins from sophomore Jen O’Brien
in both the 1-meter diving competition

(275.77) and the 3—meter competition

(263.85). O’Brien also scored a second
place f1r1ish in the 1-meter competition.
Senior Moreen O’Brien swam to a third
place ﬁnish in the 3—meter competition.

The last event of the meet was the
200-yard medley relay, where the Lady
Panthers needed to place at least ﬁrst and
third to tie the meet. The Knights were
too powerful and only allowed Pitt to
place second and fourth.

Despite the loss, head coach Marian
Cassidy Keen was impressed with (her

The women’s swimming and diving team was just 19 points away from upset-

More convicts than
Cowboys in Dallas  

Column, page 9

It appears that Newton, who was

' dubbed "The Kitchen,” was either planning

on baking a ton of brownies, or planning on
being an entrepreneur. Newton was arrested
last week after police conﬁscated 213
pounds of marijuana from him in a van on
ahighway.

Newton and two others were charged

‘ with possession and intent to distribute mar-
ijuana. Newton, a six—time Pro Bowl olTen-
sive lineman who helped Dallas win three
Super Bowls, spent 13 seasons in Dallas.

Can anyone explain to me why some-
one who made millions and was probably
on his way to the Hall of Fame would need
to sell weed? Was it for the thrill or was he
just trying to keep up the tradition of
America’s team?

Michael Irvin, who has one of the most
expensive noses in America, was arrested
more than once for possession of cocaine,
and he has also been caught with prosti-
tutes. Of course, being that he’s part of
America’s team, the American judicial sys-

'3 tem pulled through and has continually let

him go.
The newest Cowbust was handed to

comerback Kareem Larrirnore, who was -

suspended for one year for violating the
league’s substance abuse policy. Jones

2 released him. One less salary equals anoth-

er opportunity for a new facelift for the

owner.
Emrnitt Smith,_ another selﬁsh
Cowboy, is currently hurt. Smith is out for
two to four weeks with a knee injury. He
has been hurt all season and has not been
the same player over the past two seasons.
The team went 5-11 last season and is
off to a 2-6 start this season, but of course,
Smith is hanging around so he can try to
break the Walter Payton’s all-time rushing

. record.

I’m not doubting that Smith is one of
the best ever, but to stay around past your
prime just to’ break a record does not sit well
with me.

As an Eagles fan, my distaste for the
Cowboys never wavers. Whether they ﬁn-
ish 15-1 or 1-15 doesn’t affect my feelings.
I can’t stand ’em and I’ll never be able to
stomach the silver and blue.

Their fans are not true. They are band-
wagon jumpers. How many Cowboys’ hats
or jackets have you seen lately? If you like
the Cowboys and you’re not from Dallas,
my guess is that you’re also an Atlanta
Braves fan or a Leaf fan. '

If you’re not one of those clueless fans,
and you still sport the star on your gear, then
that limits you to being the team’s drug
dealer.

Kenneth Paul is the sports editor 0fThe Pitt
News and he would have liked to have the
keys to the van. _

Blowout, page 9

12 ﬁrst half points.
' ‘Wlttenmyer, a junior, ﬁnished the
game with a tearn-high 16 points. She also
pulled down six rebounds, with ﬁve com-
ing off the offensive glass. VV1ttenmyer
said that she takes pride on her ability to
pull down offensive rebounds.
“Boards mean a lot, especially oﬁen-
I sive reboun ,” she said. “It gives us
another chance to score. Offensive
rebounds are backbreakers.”
A In the second half, the Panthers con-

tinued to put on pressure defensively as .

most of the tearn’s early points came off of
fast breaks. The Panthers dominated the
transition game, scoring 34 fast break
points to the Express’ four.

The Panthers dominated the second
half, outscoring the Express 50-20. Every
Panther got involved by the end of the

. game as ten players saw double-digit min-

utes and ﬁve scored over 10 points or
more. ‘

‘Toward the end of the game, the
Panthers had the opportunity to get their
young players some experience. One of
those players, Allisha Morris, a freshman
from Hampton, Virginia, took advantage
of her 18 minutes of play.

Morris ﬁnishing the gamewith a dou-
ble-double as she scored 10 points and
racked up a tearn—high 16 rebounds.

Another freshman for the Panthers
who contributed was Haley Harguth.
Harguth matched Wittenrnyer’s 16 points,
making ﬁfty percent (3-6) of her three-

' point attempts.

The Panthers got into triple digits with
3 seconds remaining in the game, to ﬁnish
off their exhibition schedule on a good
note. ' ' ’ '

Friday. at home against Wﬂliarn and Mary.
