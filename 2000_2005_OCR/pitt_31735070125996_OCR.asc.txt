Pitt, FBI offer $10,000
for info leading to
anthrax caller’s arrest

RICK NEFF
Staff Writer

 

 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2001

         n’  

  

 

The FBI and Pitt want the man who evacuated Oakland with the
threat of anthrax, and they are offering a $10,000 combined reward

_ for any information that leads to his arrest and conviction.

The FBI initially offered a $5,000 reward for information about
the case, and on Wednesday Pitt ofﬁcials matched the amount.

' On Oct. 13, police ofﬁcers wearing gas masks disrupted Pitt’s
homecoming celebration, evacuating people from Hillman Library
and the William_Pitt Union after receiving two threatening calls.

A few hours later, the same person phoned Pittsburgh 911 two
more times from the North Side. He then said that he was releasing
the deadly bacteria in the Allegheny Center Apartments.

According to an FBI press release, "in each incident the caller
identiﬁed himself as Aliq Mohammad and spoke with a poorly imi-
tated Middle—Eastem accent that faded away as the call continued.

All four threats tumed. out to be a hoax, and law enforcement
ofﬁcials are pursuing the prank caller.

. “There are three agencies working on the case; the Pitt police,
the Pittsburgh police, and the FBI, “ said Special Agent Bill Crowley.

The first threat was calledin at 9:05 pm and the FBI traced it to

. a phone in the basement of the William Pitt Union. _

The second call came an hour later. This time, the caller used a
pay phone at the -intersection of-Oakland and Forbes avenues.

If the man is caught, the penaltieswill be severe. A spokesman
for the U.S. Attomey’s Ofﬁce, Phil Brysh, said that his office would
prosecute’ under a federal statute that makes it a crime to threaten
injuiy to another person over an interstate commerce medium. Brysh
explained that by using phone lines to make his threat, the prank
caller is in violation of that law. A

“The penalties are severe for this oﬁense, they include a prison
sentence up to ﬁve years and a ﬁne up to $250,000,” Brysh said.

Anyone with any information about the identity of the person
who placed the calls is urged to contact the FBI at (412) 471-2000.
All calls will be kept conﬁdential.

  Pitt police must now address anthrax scares daily

KATE LAUGHLIN V

The Pitt News

Police were calledto Eddie’s Cafe on

1 Friday, Oct. 18 at about 10 am. to investigate '

a package containing a white, powdery sub-
stance. That evening they also responded to
a call concerning whitepowder on the ﬂoor
in Salk Hall. '

The Eddie’s ﬁnding was detennined not
to be hazardous, and the powder in Salk was
determined to be remnants from a ﬂuores-
cent light bulb and plaster.

' In the weeks since the Oct. 13 telephone

calls warning about the dispersion of anthrax
on,Pitt’s campus, students and faculty have
beenon alert for the real thing. The Pitt
police have rushed to the scene of many calls
concerning suspicious envelopes, packages
or substances on campus. ' 

“We have received 19 calls in the last
two weeks but no actual threats,” said Pitt
police Chief Tim Delaney. "Ihat’s two or
three a day, and it’s taxing.” .

Pitt is not alone in what is becoming a

nationwide bioterrorism scare, as universi— ‘

ties all over the country are dealing with sim-
ilar fears. - I

At the University of Maryland on
Tuesday, police received an‘ e-mail from
someone claiming to have released anthrax
and smallpox into the ventilation systems of
26 campus buildings. A Boston University

student living in the dorms called the police M

last Friday after discovering’ white powder

taped to the inside of his phone bill. Andi

police at the University of Pennsylvania
responded to at least ﬁve calls this week
about unusual powders or packages.

These and countless other threats across
our nation’s campuses were deemed false
alarms. So far, America’s student body

remains untouched by bioterrorism, at least
physically.

But judging by the volume of calls to
the police, the real or imagined threat has
taken its toll mentally. 1

“For some people the paranoia seems

contagious,” Pitt senior Beth Haggerstone
said. “My mom told me not to open any mail
at work I think the precautions are necessary

though. You have to at a time like this.”

Although the ‘police carmot ~ check

John Baumgardner’s limp body was sprawled on the ground in Schenley Quad last
night just before he rose to lead a dozen ghoulishly clad women in the group’s ren-

dition of Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller.’

HollandHall haunted after
all — but only for a night

TARA SUTTON
The Pitt News

Last night, the parking lot in
Schenley Quad was occupied not by
cars, but by students, both living
and dead. _ ‘

And every half hour the dead
came together and danced while the
living looked on. 

The Quad Resident Student
Association and Resident Life held
their 25th annual Nightmare_in the
Quad and Holland Haunted House
last night. The festivities included
eight booths, a live band and a
haunted house. ‘

Parking meters were trans-
formed into ghosts and spider webs
clung to the trees. A giant pumpkin
stood in the center, threatening to
blow away with the swirling wind
that nature added to the spooky
Halloween aura. '

Along the sidewalk, games pro— -

vided students‘ with entertainment.

If participants guessed the number
of candy corn in a jar, they could
win prizes ranging from Pitt appar-
el to a desk lamp. Revelers threw
ping—pong balls for fish, beanbags
for glow sticks and darts for Pixy
Stix. The Book Center also donated
books as prizes.
Meanwhile, others
patiently in lines for tarot card
readings and caricatures, which

proved the night’s most popular

booths.

Popcorn, cookies and snow
cones were the refreshments for the
brisk night, and soda was also
served.

Organized Chaos, a band from
Brackenridge Hall, provided music
for the evening, playing their owns
songs and covering ‘others. Band
members _also served as deejays
during their breaks.

 ”Author tells Pitt   
*  audience to listen,   i
but nottoo hard  

KATE DALON 9 '
The Pitt News

Before reading excerpts from

' , his book ‘Wednesday night, John

D’Agata asked“ his audience to lis-
ten with an open mind.

“Because it is ‘written as col-
_lage, I ask you just relax and not
listen too hard, because some of the
pieces don’t fit too well,” he said
during his speech in the Frick Fine

— Arts Auditorium.

_ . D’Agata was referring to his
“Collage History of Art by Henry
Darger,” a lyric essay from his new
book, “Halls of Fame,” about the
life of a man almost forgotten by
society. " '

Through recycled popular say- A

ings, D’Agata revealed the story of
Henry Darger, a man who was
orphaned and labeled insane in his

youth. _

D’Agata said that Darger is a
character that society almost com-
pletely ignored. Darger worked as a
dishwasher throughout his life,
escaping notice until his death
when impressive works of art were
found in his apartment. Among the
works were numerous collages, as
well as a novel.

He told listeners how Darger

’ wrote a novel and made collages to

react to the world he knew. He
described Darger’s collages as
“putting a gray wash over every-
thing to make the seams of our

memories fade.” v

D’Agata has been published in
journals such as the Paris Review,
Utne Reader and the Gettysburg

Review. He is currently an editor of H

lyric essays for the Seneca Review.
Collision, . the semi-annual
undergraduate nonfiction journal of
the University Honors College,
sponsored the reading.
Collision’s senior editor, Carey

S Smith, said that the group was

happy to host a speaker as accom-
plished asD’Agata.

“We were excited about getting
John to speak,” Smith said. “[‘Halls
of Fame’] is his first book, but it’s

' getting great reviews.”

D’Agata arrived at Pitt Monday
and worked closely with the
English department throughout the
week. He was a featured speaker in
various_ literature and nonfiction
courses, offering personal insights

_ into creativenonfiction writing.

. “If you just want to struggle
against racism but not capitalism,
then you’re not serious about black
liberation.” _ V

These were the words of
Freedom Road Socialist V Sanjulo
Ber, a member of the Black Radical
Congress ' and a speaker‘ at
Wednesday night’s forum on racism
and" anti~racism. Students for
Solidarity, the group that sponsored
the event, assembled several speak-
ers, including Ber, to help educate
students about race‘ relations.

A group of about 40 attended

the forum, which began with gradu-
ate student Rich Goff, a member of
Solidarity.

“There’s a certain irony in being
the white guy and speaking first at a
forum on racism,” Goff said. He
began his discussion by explaining
that there are two types of racism:
hard and soft. He used the Ku Klux
Klan and as an example of hard
racism, while calling, unconscious
judgments a form of soft racism.

“Race is a falsification  race
is not real,” Goff said. “It attempts
to explain something that it does
not explain.” In response to those
who claim racism is dead, Goff
quoted civil rights leader Malcolm

Racism speaker gives his recipe for black liberation

X: “Racism is like a Cadillac, they
come out with a new model every
year.”

Ber spoke next. A socialist who
grew up with a steel—working
father, Ber has been fighting for
black liberation for more than 40
years. His declaration that the end
to racism will come with a socialist
revolution with “Black folks lead-
ing the way,” was met with scat-
tered .“Right ons” from the audi-
ence.

He also expressed opposition to
the war on terrorism.

LINTON Weeks
The Washington Post

It’s everywhere.

Everywhere.

Suddenly there are no degrees of sepa-
ration. We are all in this together. k

From the White House in Washington,
D.C., to the White House Cafe in Camden,
Ark. At the cafe on Adams Street, owner
Teresa Lampkin says: “People are scared to
go out. Thcy’re scared to go spend their
money. We have a lot of ammunition plants
here. If it wasn’t for that, everything wo11ld
have gone to crap.”

It’s in the nooks and the crannies of
America: our conversations, our prayers,
our sitcoms, our sporting events. Plans, pas-
sions. It has changed the past and the future.

, It’s been everywhere, from the ﬁrst
plane crash. In New York and Washington
and Pennsylvania more than 5,000 died and
people around the country knew somebody,
or hoped they didn’t know somebody.

Terrorists seemed to have skulkcd all
over the place, a burst of pins on the nation-
al map. They took ﬂight lessons in Florida
and Minnesota, perused adult videos and
worked out at a ﬁtness club in Maryland
and were captured — on videotape — in

- Maine.

The Sears Tower in Illinois and
Disneyland in California were on a target
list. .
Then came news of more elusive evil-
docrs and sleeper cells and anthrax and
water-supply threats and other weirdnesses

»— and the burst of pins has become a blan-

ket. The U.S. Postal Service is sending a
how-to—handlc—anthrax postcard this week
to every house, every apartment, every
rural free delivery mailbox, every rental
mailbox, every military address in the
country.

CANTON, N.C. — Skeeter C11rtis,

owner of Skceter’s BBQ House, lost a frat-
ternity brother in the Trade Center destruc-
tion. “There’s quite a few people from here
in the  overseas,” he says. “My
son’s ﬁrst-grade teacher’s assistant’s son is
a Ranger. She knows he’s over there, but
doesn’t know where he is.” '

The town is collecting money for the
families of the rescue workers who died in
New York- ‘

There was a parade last Friday. Guys
walked down the street in work clothes,
holding little ﬂags. ‘ i~

Curtis says the war “has affected
everybody. We’re a little small community.
At breakfast, the men, it’s on everybody’s
mind —— sorrow and anger and everything
in between.”

' DUXBURY, Mass. — Since Sept. 11,
Mary Lampert has been swamped with
calls from folks wanting potassium iodide
pills in case they are involved in a nuclear
accident. Lampert lives near the 
Nuclcar_ Power Station in Plymouth. For
years she has been lobbying the govem-
mcnt to stockpile the pills, which can help
protect people from cancer caused by radi-
ation. “People have been calling like mad,”
Larnpert says. -

BUENA VISTA, Va. —— Last week,
Rob Fabrizio Jr., president and general
manager of Courtesy Ford, received an
express package. When an employee
opened it, cardboard dust ﬂew out. Another
employee, whose son is an FBI agent in
New York, called 911. The Rockbridge
County hazmat team arrived and the state
health department tested the package for
anthrax. The test came back negative.

“Clearly, it’s very weird,” Fabrizio
says. “I don’t think Osama bin Laden

knows where Courtesy Ford is. Or Buena‘
Vista. Everybody’s on edge and more cau-i "

tious, For it to even come down this far, to
a small town in a rural setting.”

“We have some highly sensitive areas

that the department is focused on,” he said.
Delaney added that he does not think

people are oveneacting. “The only way to

" combat this is through communication,

through making a uniﬁed effort”

He said the Pit police follow city of
Pittsburgh protocol when examining suspi-
cious packages. If they cannot determine
that an open envelope or package is harm-

, less, they send it to the FBI command post at

the Allegheny Fire Academy for further

examination. If it is unopened and poses a
possible threat, Delaney said, -it is sent back
to postal inspectors.

' Variables that police consider when
evaluating suspect packages include exces-
sive postage, incorrect titles, oily stains or
discoloration and an absence of a return
address. Other relevant questions include
whether the intended recipient was expect-

ing a package, or if the recipient is aware of A

where the package originated
“The fear is really what the problem is,”
Delaney concluded. He also said that the

Ghouls, goblins, pop-star

impersonators spotted in Quad

Holland, page 2

Baumgardner — a resident assistant
in McCormick Hall — performed a
dance to Michael Jackson’s
“Thriller” every half hour. His sis-
ter Amanda taught the ‘dance the
last two years, and he continued the
legacy this year.

“We practiced for four nights,” -

he said. He said that the dance was
also longer this year.

“It was fun to learn,” said Julie
Gambone, a resident assistant" in
McCormick and first-time
“Thriller” dancer.

While the parking lot above-
ground bustled with activity, some-
thing else lurked underground.

Students waited in anticipation
to experience the Holland Haunted
house, which was not offered last
year due to the renovations in the
Quad. A group of women argued
over who would go first as they
danced to the music. _

A donation of $1 or a non—per-
ishable food item — in addition to a
signed release form — granted stu-
dents access to the basement and
sub-basement of the Scheneley
Quad. -

‘fThe policeman at ‘the entrance

and the form really hyped it up,”

» said junior Sarah Conley.”

“It was_ ood in a way  it
makes you gunk there was a lot
going on,” said sophomore Justin
Belarski. '

After signing-the form and

being ‘informed about the strobe-

light and smoke machine, a witch
and two masked men accompanied
students on an elevator ride to the
basement. One man began to bleed,
and another held a cat -with a spin-
ning head. ‘

The witch led students through
a hallway filled with ghouls and
other creatures. Ghosts jumped out
to grab the frightened spectators,
and a skeleton bride lurked in the
corner. Further down, a casket
shook while ‘screams came from
inside, and a girl pleaded to be
freed from her handcuffs.

After some scares and screams,
students escaped the basement
through a door by 7-Eleven.

“I d'idn’t~know what to expect  I
didn’t even know there was a base-
ment,” said Asha Kamat, a sopho-
more. “It was a good way to raise
canned goods.” 3

event are given to charity. For the

said. «
The final speaker was Kadir

Gunduz, director of the Islamic,

Center of Pittsburgh. Gunduz
opened his discussion‘ with an
Islamic prayer and then informed
the crowd that of the four million
Arab-Americans in . the United
States today, three million are
Christian. He also said that there
are a total of six million Muslims in
the United States, and that of those

. only one million are Arab-
Americans. .
He explained that many

Americans hold many misconcep-
tions about Arabs.

“Not all Arabs are Muslim, and
not all Muslims are Arab,” he said.

Gunduz, who directs the Islamic
Center on Bigelow Boulevard, says
that city officials provided extra
security after the attacks, and that
they received no threatening or

1‘ Race speaker addresses war’s implications

offensive calls. Instead he said
more than 200 people have either
stopped in or called to pledge their
support. _

‘-‘Most of the problems came
from the police and FBI,’ said
Gunduz, referring to unprofessional
actions taken by certain" officers
and agents. One member of the
audience sarcastically responded,
“That’s their job.”

Gunduz corrected him, by say-
ing that as institutions, these orga-
nizations did not encourage such
actions, but that it had been the
wrongful choices of individuals
that he was condemning.

As the forum ended, professor
Dennis Brutus from the Africana
studies department discussed the

World Conference on Racism he-

had attended recently in Durbin,
South Africa, a conference that the
United States had walked out of.
He, as well as the other speakers,
expressed his hope that in time,
people would all learn to be more
conscious of one another, no matter
what their skin color.

leads on anthrax caller

To encourage tips in the search for a
caller who threatened the release of
anthrax on lower campus and on the
North Side on Oct. 13, Pitt has doubled
the FBI’s $5,000 reward for information
leading to an arrest.

Pitt’s wise decision to increase the
reward reveals the University’s comrnit-
ment to finding the perpetrator and to
warding off future scares. Clearly, Pitt
did its part in offering a lucrative incen-
tive for those who have information to
come forward. Now is the time for those
people to fulﬁll their social obligation
and aid in the investigation.

Recall the evening of Oct. 13th. It I

was homecoming weekend. Students,
parents and alumni ﬂooded campus
expecting a good time, not a night inter-
rupted by frightening threats of bioter-
rorism. Parts of Forbes Avenue were
blocked off for hours. Police equipped

with gas masks evacuated numerous_

buildings, including several dorms, leav-
ing hundreds of students frightened and
temporarily on the streets.

While some may not want to help
the police because they don’t regard ofﬁ—
cers amicably, people must not forget the
severity of the situation. The anthrax
caller knowingly caused disruption and

fear on campus, providing Pitt students
and Oakland dwellers a localized, per-
sonal taste of national fears. The calls
were no harmless or humorous prank
and the caller must meet the serious ram-
iﬁcations of his acts.

Others may be withholding informa-
tion, believing that it won’t be relevant
or helpful. All potential tips must be
called in to the police or FBI. One can’t
be sure what pieces may come together
to solve the puzzle. '

It is also possible that the caller had
accomplices. The FBI and police should
consider offering immunity .or lesser
charges to accomplices or accessories
who wisely chose to cooperate with
authorities. This, would likely facilitate
the identification and arrest of" the man
who actually placed the calls.

Even without such an offer, poten-

tially guilty parties should also consider

aiding in the investigation. This apparent
change of heart would likely result in a
beneﬁcial deal to diminish charges.

The man who placed these calls
must be caught and this will likely only
occur with the help of tips. With the
increased encouragement of $10,000,
people need not hesitate to contact th
police with tips. ’

Isolationism sometimes best policy

America has become an international
busybody.

It isn’t a role we’ve always played. Our
very ﬁrst president set a precedent of isola-
tionism when he ended his farewell address
with the warning, “Stay out of foreign
affairs.” '

For the most part, for more than a cen-
tury, we honored his philosophy. Having
seen Europe’s then-frequent wars, we
learned that dealing with other countries

should look into doing the same. '

and never consistent.
‘ I’ve heard them call gorgeous

women “not that great” and slightly less I

good—1ooking women “incredibly hot.”
Of course, at least one roommate is
bound to’ disagree with another’s' assess-
ment. .

It’s frustrating, but I’ve learned that
my roommates, and possibly billions of
other boys across the world, are simply
insane when it comes to this stuff. They
have absolutely no idea what they do or
do not like. They wake up one morning
hating blondes and the next day wake up
hating brunettes. It’s a fact of life, and
I_’m used to it by now. A

mates think I’ll know all the answers to

ing, but when I don’.t know, they get
upset. ' '
“C’mon, you’re a girl! You’ve got to

know why [insert girl’s name] turned me _
down for a date,” they’ll say. How could,-

I possibly‘ explain the motives of a girl
I’ve never met? V
To‘ make matters worse,-they don’t

’ feel any particular need to listen to my
problems. It’s‘ not that they don’t care. ,. .

It’s just that they’ve been raised, just like

all men, to have this unconscious feeling‘

that they have the male privilege. That is,
they should get to control any situation or
conversation. They don’t have any par-
ticular interest in the problems of some-
one non-male. "

But my roommates are truly caring
people. They really do try to help me

when they can. If they manage to notice
that I’m upset about something, they’ll .
put down the video games for at least a _

minute or two to find out what’s up. They

are at least attempting to break out of any

sexism that society instilled in them.
Brandon, Doug and Taku respect

women more’ than any other group of.
guys I’ve ever encountered, particularly '

at college. They all have plenty of oppor-
tunity to take advantage of * women, but
they never do. I don’t believe that even
one of my roommates would have‘ a

“one-night stand.” It’s rare to find a_.
group of men who are so interested in '~

emotional as well as physical connec-
tions with women.

So when people ask me why I live
with three guys, I usually simply answer,

' “Because they’re great guys,” and I_'

mean it.

Most of the time, my roommates I

learn a lot from me, and I from them. The
four of us have had more interesting con-
versations in our living room since
September than some people have in a

year. A girl couldn’t‘ ask for better room- _

After the Panthers lost to the N o.

Successful fall season kickstartstennis team

SHAUN GRIFFIN -

This month was a busy one for the women’s
tennis team, filling out its short but tenacious
fall schedule. '

In that span, the team had a blowout 7-2 win
at Bloomsburg, a close 5-4 loss at Youngstown
State and traveled to two tournaments, ripe with
talent.

The most recent of their matches was last
weekend’s West Virginia University Invitational,
which'was rescheduled because of the terrorist
attacks. ‘

Pitt’s top doubles tandem of "sophomore Jill
Williams and junior Nikki Borza made it all the
way to the final match, -in the toughest section of
the tournament, opening the eyes of some high-
er-ranked opponents on the way there.

“They played some very gcod tennis,” said
head‘ coach George Dieffenbach. “They beat
Duquesne’s No. 1 team, West Virginia’s top team
and lost to West Virginia’s ‘No. 2 team in the
finals.” ’

Borza and Williams each had a win in the top
singles section as well. '

The two led the charge in the first dual meet
of the year back on Sept. 21, at Bloomsburg

beating their doubles opponents.8—5, which set
off a chain reaction. 5

-‘‘Our main strength at Bloomsburg was
sweeping the doubles,” Dieffenbach said. The
team of junior Brooke\Yablonsky and sophomore
transfer Laura Pegula won their match 8-4.
Junior Jena Fiore and sophomore Hayley Hughes

Why do fools fall in love?

Happy Accidents
Starring Vincent D’Onofrio, Marisa Tomei, Sean Gpuilett and Holland Taylor

Written and directed by Brad Anderson
-ﬁnfnfr

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE
Staff Writer

Love. The romantic in us recognizes its cause
and circumstance as cosmic intersection, or meetings
inspired by forces beyond human control. Of course,
the strength of time tests the random touch of fate,
questioning whether a chance encounter could possi-
bly be more than just that.

“Happy Accidents,” director Brad Anderson’s,

follow-up to his equally what if-driven “Next Stop

Wonderland,” tackles the pressure that most rela- P

tionships can or carmot endure. He tests how much
between two people must be analyzed and how
much must simply be overlooked. Anderson man-
ages to maintain the blissful and desperate feelings
that the best romances ﬂow between, but with a
premise that takes the cosmic connection a bit more
literally. ‘ »

Sam Deed (Vincent D’Onofn'o) is the new 
in Ruby Weaver’s (Marisa Tomei) life, but 

chronic co-dependent, she wonders how involved
she should remain with him after hearing his claims
of being a “backtraveler” from the year 2470.
Through the first two-thirds of the film, she back-
tracks through the relationship with her therapist
(Holland Taylor). She recalls how Sam, who atﬁrst

_ Rigel -ax} — Polaris :‘r>:}*:} — Alpha Centauri :1-zmrzh —the _sun

seemed naive because of his Iowa upbringing, may
have created an elaborate fantasy out of a ﬁxation on
her. But Sam is so sincere in his explanations that it’s
hard to not either pity him or love him. And as a co-
dependent, Ruby does both. .

D’Onofn'o and Tomeiare oddly but believably
matched, and their chemistry works particularly well
because the characters are so well—written.
D’Onofri_o i_s especially good, bringing to Sam a
sweetness that reels in the audience just as it does
Ruby, making the reasoning behind his “journey into
[her] arms” more than just a Sarah Connor ﬁxation;
he successfully travels the line between insanity and
persistence with a truly creative performance.

Even if you don’t appreciate his tag —, his stylized

Castles in the sky

The Last Castle ‘
Starring Robert Redford and
James Gandolfini

Directed by Rod Lurie
7’.‘m“ni‘r1/2.

Cynicism. Pessirnism. Crass com-
mercialism. Three American notions that
critics say Hollywood markets to intema—
tional audiences.

Standing up for one’s rights. Self-
worth. Hope. Three American notions
expressed in “The Last Castle.”

Given the current state of the country,
“The Last Castle” is wholly appropriate.
Directed by Rod Lurie (“The
Contender”), the story revolves around
General Irwin (Robert Redford), a court
martialed, three-star general. He is torn
between doing his time and ﬁghting
alongside fellow disgraced soldiers
against the oppressive and disgraceful

warden, Colonel Winter (James
Gandolfini).

Of course, like any good American,
General Irwin chooses to fight.

Winter initially idolizes Irwin, but his
admiration soon turns sour. After a few
misplaced remarks by Irwin,Winter
begins treating him like every other pris-
oner, but he is still affectionate toward
him.

The tension between the two charac-

No, we didinot
Photshop the flag
into this picture.

ters results in a Salieri vs. Mozart type of
battle. Winter worships Irwin, but wants to
be appreciated in his own right. The two
lock horns in a battle of wits that drives the
rest of the story.

In the acting battle between Redford
and Gandolﬁni, Gandolﬁni beats out
Redford, which is no small task.
Gandolﬁni delivers one of the best perfor-
mances of the year and one of the best
heavy-breathing performances ever.

Throughout the movie, Irwin instills
the many positive American ideals into the
prisoners that had been stripped away
from them by Winter. Watching Redford
do this is fantastic. He could very well be

reassuring the audience that what deﬁnes _

us as Americans is still there and can never
be taken away, despite these dark days.

Naturally, there is some heavy-hand-
ed ﬂag waving throughout the movie,
especially toward the end. But that’s all
right. It makes sense for the movie and it
makes sense for the American moviegoers
today. Patriotism, even if it’s bloated, is
better than some dumbed-down explosion
any day.

It is stirring to see an American icon
like Robert Redford raise the American
ﬂag in “The Last Castle.” It shows those
Hollywood critics that movies are portray-
ing America’s positive ideals. More
importantly, it reassures Americans that no
matter how bleak things look, America
will always come out on top.

—— Dante A. Ciampaglia, stajfwriter

Spaceyed-out

K-Pax '

Starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff
Bﬁdges._

Directed by Iain Softley

si‘r72ri‘r I

The line of students outside the-
~William Pitt Union Ballroom to

catch a sneak preview of “K—Pax”

was enough to testify that the film is

one of the most highly publicized ‘of
the year. Its spirit combines many
people’s imaginations with the sim-
ple but captivating qualities of
“Forrest Gurrip” and “Phenomenon.”

Acclaimed actor Kevin Spacey,

stars as Prot, a man who turns up_at
New York’s Grand Central Station
after a mugging. He claims to be
from another planet, and the case is
turned over to a psychiatric hospital.
Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff
Bridges, investigates Prot’s - strange
behavior, such as eating whole
apples, core included and bananas,
peel included, saying that Earth’s
produce was worth the trip from his
home planet K-Pax.

Powell delves deeperinto Prot’s
mind, with the assumption that he is
a perfectly normal human, except for
being a few fries short of a Happy
Meal. As fellow patients are

Pm great. I'm great:

intrigued by his curiosity and simple
wisdom, Powell finds Prot’s facade a
very convincing one, especially after
he dazzles scientists with knowledge

‘ of K-Pax’s solar system, which is a

thousand light years aw.ay.

. When Prot returns to K—Pax with
his report of observations from
Earth, everyone around him looks
deeply into their own lives, finding

that K-Pax’s differences help them‘-

savor Earth’s normality.

Producer Lawrence Gordon com-
pared the film to hisprevious pro-
duction “Field of Dreams,” saying

that they are both about compassion-

ate men who go against convention-
al behavior. One very clever touch to

“K-Pax” is the emphasis on light,

with the use of spectral light and
reﬂection in shots of New York and

‘Dr. Powell’s office. Prot himself

wears cherry red glasses, claiming
that ‘Earth is too brightfor K-Paxian
taste. _ .

With the tender comedy of one-
liners, the exchanges between Prot
and Dr. Powell and the social
tragedy found in most psychiatric
hospitals, “K-Pax” may not live up
to the grand show of publicity that

precededit, but it’s a good movie to —

sit back and forget about everything
else.

South’ by

Scott Miller and the

Commonwealth

Monday, 8 p.m. _,

Club Cafe, $8 advance, $10 day
of show

(412) 431-4950

Traditions — some good and some bet
ter left in the past —- are still a lively part of

. Southern culture. Southerners still wave

Confederate ﬂags alongside today’s ﬂag.
Civil War re—enactors wear scruﬁ”y gray uni-
forms amidst tourists in blue jeans and
Hawaiian—print shirts. Collard greens and
grits are as common as Chicken McNuggets
and Big Macs. And in Scott Miller and the
Commonwealth’s ﬁrst album, Thus Always
to Yjzrants (Sugar Hill Records), lyrics about

“the cause” share the same CD space as,

modern rock songs.

Each of the songs on the album has a
country twang, but guitars and lots of bass
make certain ones, like “Yes IWon’t,” sound
more like rock and have only a trace of
country inﬂuence. The song’s chorus is
upbeat with great rhythm, but the verses are
spoken rather than sung. But this becomes
irritating and spoils the song as a whole.

    

One of the best songs on the album is
about a man who writes letters to his lover.,°
Appropriately titled “Dear Sarah,” this sweet
love song, accompanied by a ﬁddle and gui-
tar, tells the story of a soldier during the Civil
War. “Highland Country Boy,” a faster song
but with a style similar to “Dear Sarah,” also
takes the listener into the deep South. It even
includes a harmonica. Unless the listener is
into bluegrass music, the twang becomes

armoying.

Thetrnajority of the "songs are ballads, P

but the song topics are not limited to love.

Stories about relationships with parents, .

alcoholism and leaving town are included in
the album. '

’ Scott Miller and the ' Commonwealth
begin the album with rock, ease their way
into country and end it with gospel music.
“Is There Room on the Cross for Me” is a
slow, sad and soulful ballad accompanied by
piano music. Eventually, Miller’s strong
vocals take over. He sings the last words of
the song, as well as the album, a cappella.

Civil War buffs and adventurous music
listeners alike will probably appreciate

' Miller’s ﬂioughtful lyrics andeasy, melodic

voice. Those who steer clear of country
twangs, collard greens and the like should be
forewarned. This album immerses the listen-
er in Southern culture.

Picture a hoedown. Picture a polka.
Now picture the two together on a strong
(lose of acid, and ladies and gentlemen,

you’ve got Hypnotic Clambake.

Hypnotic Clambake performs at
Rosebud this Friday night, and just like the
band’s newest release, Varicose Brain, it is
guaranteed to be an evening of music like
you’ve never heard before.

The ﬁddle and accordion play in har-
mony with the guitar/drum/bass formula on
all of the Clambake’s tracks. The bonus of
the Pink Floyd—esque haunting whisper on
various tracks adds to the band’s mystique.
Adding to the band’s mystique is the bonus
of the haunting, Pink Floyd—esque whispers
that occasionally crop up in their songs.

The bandcanbeeasily cornparedtoany
of the bands that are part of the growing

“jam ban ” genre, especially early Phish,

minus the vacuum cleaner. '
But Hypnotic Clambake also bears
strong musical resemblance to early modern

rock acts like They Might Be Giants, espe- ‘

cially on songs like, “Ed McWoman” and
“Truck Driving Bill.” _

The band also tackles some serious and
pressing world issues. In “Mad Cow,”
Maury Rosenberg, the group’s frontman,
armounces his call to arms to save the good
people of England, and sings out, “So let’s
all take a stand/lend those folks a hand,/,U.S. ‘
beef will save the day.” Don’t let the politics '
scare you away, kids. ' ,

While lacking in lyrics, Hypnotic
Clambake does have some true talentthat
they show with their musical skills. You may
think that the ﬁddle and accordion could
never work, but surprisingly it does.

People thought that some of the greatest
bands. in the world were nothing more than
“weird,” and a lot of those bands went on to
be distinguished as “genius.” .

The jury is still out on the ‘verdict for
Hypnotic Clambake — judge for yourself
and go check them out.

Girls not just dressing
for guys

I was bothered by Eric Mi]ler’s
October 23rd article, “Girls who dress
like whores distractive, not attractive.”
He seems to assume that all girls who
dress in tight black pants and tank tops
are dressing for him.

Granted, some girls who do dress
up — well, barely get dressed — for
parties have the intention of attracting
attention from guys, some with the
intention of “getting drunk, getting felt
up,” etc. I know this isn’t the intention
of all girls. When dressing for a party, I
dress in less because I’m expecting a
crowd. Regardless of the weather out-
side, in the basement of a fraternity or
a house on Semple Street it’s going to
be hot. .

If girls are dressing to attract guys’
attention, it’s because of mixed mes-
sages they receive from guys who
won’t consider them out of that con—
text, even if they usually wear Miller’s
suggested “cozy hooded sweatshirts.”
Guys’ eyes follow a nice piece of T and
‘A, they utter “damn,” they may try to
strike up conversation, yet I wouldn’t
get a second look on the street if I
passed by in the “desirable” sweatsuit
What message would I receive? If I
want his attention, to approach him or
be approached by him, I have to “dis— '
tract” him before I can ever “attract”
him, to use Mi1ler’s terms. .

Women should be cognizant ' of
their presentation, as should men, but
people should dress for themselves. It’s
all pull-and-tug between images and
interpretations of those images, but

A self-irnage is key. ‘

Intervention results in unintended consequences

for proﬁt, rely on America to provide.

But we can’t just help and then com-
pletely pull out of the situation. Just ‘as I
always wound up in the doghouse when I
got involved: we can’t enter the intemation—
al arena without olfending somebody.

Since the events of Sept. 11, cynics
around the world have echoed that we “got
what we deserved” for sticking our nose
where it doesn’t belong. Though such critics
strike me as cowards, that sentiment reﬂects
how a lot of the world views America

I’m not saying we should ignore every-
thing going on outside our borders —— some
events do demand our attention. If a group of

kids picked a ﬁght with one of my buddies,
Iwould naturally jump in—atthe very least
we could share a hospital room while recov-
ering from our wounds.

the difference between international and
domestic affairs. An act of war between
countries, like when Iraq invaded Kuwait 11
years ago, demands our intrusion. An upris-
ing within another country, like Somal_ia,
does not. If we learned to choose our battles
wisely, we might win clearer victories.

America receives a great deal of criti-
cism for playing Big Brother to the world

Many countries are eager to accept our
money but then grumble about the political
conditions attached It’s time to ask why
we’re involved in the places we are, particu-
larly where we’re not wanted. We can’t
withdraw from the commitments we’ve
already made, but in the future, we need to
remember that ﬁiendships work best when
there’s a little breathing room among the par-
ties involved.

The United States has been around for
over two centuries —- it’s time to get beyond
our middle school psychology.

Greed and free agency  

Friday, October 26, 2001

stillhurtingbaseball  

With the baseball season quickly
coming to an end, it is once again -time
for general managers and owners to
outbid the others and sign free agents.
The list of free agents at the
end of the World Series is
long.

Big-name players
include. home run king
Barry Bonds, reigning
American League Most
Valuable - Player Jason
Giambi, most improved
player Bret Boone of

 

the highest bidder. _

What ever happened to people like
Tony Gwynn, Cal Ripken and John
Franco? These players stayed with

» their original team for the
outskirt of their respective
careers, put up great num-°
bers and still are multi-mil-
lionaires today.

Baseball needs to take
a hint from football in
order to realize that, by
players moving from team

Every year in small—market cities
such as Pittsburgh, we hear cries of,
“It’s not fair.” “We can’t buy a champi-
onship like the Yankees.” -“We just
don’t have the money.” I totally agree
with Pittsburghers and other small-
market cities. I hate baseball’s free
agent market. .

grown out of hand, enough so that no

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Pitt rugby comes off of a domi-
nating 56-0 victory over John
Carroll University.

Head coach Dan Talbert said that
his team played “one hell of a
game.” Although the John Carroll
team was outmatched and not the
strongest -competition that the team
has played, Talbert said that he
couldn’t have asked for a better
played game by his young team.

The forwards took the lead in the
first half for Pitt; pushing the JCU
pack around in scrums as the Pitt
scrum wheeled the JCU scrum
around on several occasions.

The game got off to a slow start
but Alex Francani got the scoring
started for the Panthers as he tucked
the ball and scored from 10 meters
out for one of his two scores.
Francani ran through two defenders
and wrestled with a third before
stretching out over the tryline, which
is akin to the goal line in football, to
open the scoring.

A few minutes later Pitt found
itself down -in JCU territory again
and was awarded a penalty from 15

«meters out. Instead of having kicker

Jeff Shellenberger (7 for 7 on con-
versions on the day) attempt the chip
shot, captain James Szatalia opted
for a penalty play. Pitt chose to go
with a misdirection play, which
allowed for rookie Jeff Martin to
score almost untouched.

Pitt went into halftime with a 14-
0 lead. A

At halftime it had been brought
to the attention of coach Talbert that
JCU’s scrumhalf had been raking
Pitt players’ faces and kicking Pitt
players in the back when they were
down.

“Without going into detail, he
was taught a lesson in the second
half,’’ Talbert said. ‘
Although the second half trys, like
touchdowns in football, were scored
by forwards, most of the dazzling
play came from the backs, according
to Talbert.

“Our backline completely
embarrassed JCU by linking up with
one another for textbook support,”
Talbert said. “Guys were breaking
tackles, exploiting holes and com-
pleting low-percentage passes.”

In‘ rugby, players rely on support
from each other by embracing team-

the field, known as linking up. '

Talbert said that the player of the
match was Shellenberger, otherwise
known as “Wheels.”

“Every time -this little guy
touched the ball he ran in and out of
the defense "for huge gains,” the
coach said. “JCU simply had no
answers when we spread the field
out on them.” .

Scoring in the second half were
rookies Andy Kreisly, Graham
Foster and Ben Hopson.

Once the A-team finished dis-
mantling the JCU squad, the B-sides
got their turn on the field. '

The B—side lost its first match of
the year but according to Talbert,
“this was no ordinary match.” ‘

JCU didn’t have enough players‘

to form a full B—side, so JCU com-
bined its extras with Eastern
Suburbs and Rochester Men’s Clubs.

“We were out-experienced in
this game to say the least,” Talbert
said.

Pitt’s B—side lost 54-10 but the
team fought hard throughout the

Pitt rugby steamrolls over John Carroll

but we never gave up,” Talbert said. I

Rookie second row John Rooney
earned the man of the match in the
second game. Talbert said that he
has probably been the team’s most
improved player this season.

Pitt travels to Bowling Green

this weekend for the regional of the

Midwest Sweet 16, where Pitt will
face off against its old playoff No.‘ 9-
ranked rival Marshall.

“Even though we’re seriously.

lacking‘ . experience, I think we
should be'ab1e to play with these
guys,” Talbert said. “If we can just
concentrate on breaking the game
down into the simple basics, like we
did against JCU, we should be fine.
Marshall has been dominating the
Midwest for the "last four years but
we played them down to the‘ wire
two years ago.” ,

Talbert continued, “Our pack is
playing with a fire that hasn’t been
seen in this club in ten years and
we’ve never had so much athletic

‘skill and speed together in the same

back line before. They may be young
but these kids don’t hold anything
back on the field, nothing. I think
they just may be ready to upset the
No. 1 seed.”

A busy but successful month.   
for Pitt tennis’ doubles teams  

Tennis, page 

didn’t have much trouble getting

_ singles wins to put Bloomsberg

away.

“Sydnie Zillig has competed
well for- us at No. 6,”
Dieffenbach of the newcomer. “It
was an excellent dual match win for
us.”

In the team’s next meet -atthe
Bucknell Fall Classic, Pitt’s singles
players showed strong perfor-
mances. Borza made it all the way

-to the finals of Flight A. And it was

Pitt vs. Pitt in the championship
match of Flight D as Hugheswon
out over freshman Erin
Cammarano. p.

In doubles at Bucknell, Borza
and Williams lost a tiebreaker to a
highly rated Georgetown team.
Hughes took part in her second
championship as she and Fiore won,
Flight C.

Next up was the battle with
Youngstown State, where Pitt’s
doubles was its weakness.
Youngstown swept the doubles, and
singles victories as efforts from
Williams, Borza, Pegula and Zillig

weren’t enough.

Hair

said.

“We had some really close

matches with them in the past,”_
‘Dieffenbach said; “But we lost_all

three doubles points.”
_ But with good performances
last weekend at West Virginia,
Dieffenbach likes the progress of
his team as it, with the exception of
Borza and Williams, shuts down
until January and the opening of the
spring season. i ' 
“The whole team has been dedi-
cated to improving,” he said. “They
all worked very hard this fall.”‘
Borza and Williams, on -the
other hand, aren’t done yet. They
travel to the Rolex Championship at
the University of Pennsylvania,
which is a prelude to the national
indoor championships. ‘ ,1
Dieffenbach said every Division
I team can send their No. 1 singles
player and No. 1 doubles players.

Williams will be in singles compe-'

tition and will , join Borza in. the
doubles. If the team of Williams
and Borza win its ﬂight, it’s on to
the national championship

“It’s a chance to show our best
against the best in the East,”
Dieffenbach said. “It’ll be a. good
barometer for us.”

Giambi and Bonds among many to cash in large

Column, page 16

getting back to the World Series.

Now let’s look at what is going to
make me even more outraged with
Major League Baseball this off-season
starting with Jason Giambi of the
Oakland Athletics. Giambi wants a “no
trade” clause in a new contract that he
signs. Understandable. But while the
A’s at first didn’t offer Giambi the “no
trade” clause, their latest offer did and
included $91 million over six years.

Giambi is a fan favorite in Oakland
and has helped bring the A’s back to
playoff baseball. He seems to be enjoy-
ing himself in Oakland as he was quot-

ed in Maxim Magazine earlier this year
as saying, “We’re dumb, young, and
full of cum.” How in God’s name can
someone turn down that type of deal?
He could stay in Oakland and make
more money then I will ever see in my
life. V
It is reported that Giambi has been
offered a six year $150 million contract
with the Yankees after the World Series
is over. Maybe this is why he hasn’t
said yes to Oakland, but come on, give
me a break.

Let me make this a little more
clear, using a MasterCard commercial
as an example.

Batting .342 with 38 home runs

Imroved

and 120 RBI’s — awesome

Being offered $91 million by a
team — insane and ﬂattering

Being able to play for the team that
has made you a star and where the fans
idolize you —’ priceless.

Get the picture, Giambi? Stay in
Oakland. ,

My next victim on the free agent
market is Barry Bonds. I love Bonds.
He is a phenomenal athlete and gets a
bad rap fromxthe media. His 73 home
runs are unheard of. His contract has
expired with the San Francisco Giants,
a team he has spent most of his career
with. Yes, he hasn’t won a World Series
and wants to win one badly, but that’s

no reason to go to the Yankees.

Yes, the Yankees have the best
chance every year of winning the
series, but Barry, you did so well with
the Giants, stay there and try to win one
with them. You said it yourself —— win-
ning_is all that matters, and not one
player’s home runs. Stay in San
Francisco, sign for just the amount of
money you need and let your owner
have excess money to spend on the
positions‘ you need most, which is
pitching. . '

- » Juan Gonzales of the Cleveland
Indians is also a free agent this off—sea-.
son. .

He is a free agent only because. the
Indians decided not to pick up his $14
million option for 2002. After a few

years with Texas, and a year disap— .
pointing year with Detroit, Gonzales

signed a hefty one-year $10 million
contract with Cleveland. Finally,
Gonzales broke out in 2001 with a .325
batting average, 35 homers and 140

So now what will Gonzales be

doing this off-season? Looking for his

third team in three years. And why is

‘this? This is because contracts are so

high that when teams don’t do Well, the
contracts make theiteams lose money.
In the Indians case, the only waygto

support a team in 2002 was to let‘

Gonzales become a free agent again.

Gonzales, I like everyone , else’,-.jl';
wants to play for the Yankees; The
Yankees have a lot of money to burn,

and everyone wants to play for them.

_ Maybe some day players will realize
that by everyone wanting to go to the
_ Yankees, baseball‘ is suffering. ~

' No one wants to see the same team

‘win every year.‘ People like change, and

surprise. Football is bringing that this

year, baseball is not.’

High contracts don’t necessarily

lead to wins. The Yankees, while get- »

ting anyone they need, only signed one
big contract last off-season in Mike
Mussina. The biggest example of high
expenditure failure is in the Texas
Rangers who shelled out $225 million
on Alex Rodriguez, finished in last
place and now can’t afford the best
catcher in the game, Ivan Rodriguez.

Baseball has its work cut out for it
at its annual winter meetings. Salaries
are too high, players are too greedy and
owners are too willing to spend money
to buy championships, only to fall to
the Yankees each and every year.

I’m pleading to baseball in general.
Bring back the game I once knew. The
baseball that was all about having fun
and trying to win for your city and your
fans. In 2002, bring back America’s
Pasttime. We need it back.
