Greeks upset with judicialprocess

NIKKI SCHWAB,
ANASTASIA STERANKO AND
J. ELIZABETH STROHM
Staff Report

When a parent called former Sorority and
Fraternity’ Life Coordinator Anita Triggs to accuse
Pitt’s chapter of ‘the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity of
hazing, Triggs called_ the fraternity to discuss the
accusations. p ‘ .  l ‘A —' _

The fraternity members admitted to the charges
and met with aniadvocate from Pitt’s'judicial board
on Jan. V16, 2004. After hearing‘ that the board rec-
ommended that the fraternity not be suspended —
and that the men had lost any hope of challenging the
accusations by confessing‘ to them’ to Triggs -—-— the
members of TKE waited for a final decision from
Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Dean of
Students Jack Daniel.

When that final decision came, in the form of a

letter from Daniel, dated Feb. 5, the 13 members of
TKE learned that their fraternity would be suspend-
ed for a year. \ _ _ .

Thedecision, which follows a recent change -in

the Greek judicial system, has sparked discussion

‘ about the role of Student Affairs and Pitt’s judicial

board in the Greek system.

Bimey Harrigan, Pitt’s associate dean of Student
Affairs, explained that the modified system is more
consistent with the University’s policies for dealing
with violations of the Student Code of Conduct,
which includes a rule against hazing.

“It’s like every judicial process,” Harrigan said,
addressing the way in which the processing of some

, judicial violatioriis has’ changed. “The Greeks aren’t
; treated any way differently from anyone else.”

_ I But Student Government Board President Brian
Kelly, an officer of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity,
said he thinks Greekorganizations are held to a dif-
ferent standard.

. .“I_f a student gets caught underage drinking, we
don’t.kick them out of the University right away,” he
said. “We work with them and try to educate them
and make them a better person for it. That’s the
whole point of us being at a university. So why is it
one slip—up, and.you’re done [for some fraternities]?

' We all make mistakes, so why can’t wetake a more

proactive approach about it?”

Harrigan explained that, while the Greek,coun—
cils are responsible for processing “petty” violations,
any violation of the Student. Code of Conduct by a
Greek organization goes directly before. the judicial
board. Harrigan defended the existence of the Greek

councils — Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic

Association and National Pan-Hellenic Council —

R _. saying that they still serve necessary roles.

“There are many departments under each coun-
cil,” she said. “It is a governing body. You have to‘
have that type of frarnewor .”

Harrigan could not cite specific examples of the
functions of the Greek councils, but she said she
would at a later time. I

Members of the Greek community do not all
agree about what the councils’ roles should be.

“I think [judicial decisions] should definitely be

i run by IFC,” said John’Zeigler, president of Sigma

Chi, on the handling of fraternity violations of the
code of conduct. “I think that IFC should be able to
govern themselves.” ,

Despite his feelings about autonomy for IFC,

It was a truly surreal’ moment.

Anne Mundell had modeled the

facial movements of a computerized
character for Carnegie Mellon
University’s Robotics Institute.
Mundell looked into a computer

screen and came face—to—face with’

the first outlineof the character she
had modeled.

“It was disastrous,” ‘said

"Mundell, an associate professor of

design in CMU’s drama department.
“[The character] has to go through
several computer iterations before
she’s ‘done. She was completely
hideous.”

Today, the character Mundell

A modeled is much more attractive. She

- hasibig, blue eyes and short, blond

hair and wears two. -gold earrings.

In CMU’s Newell—Simon Hall,
she sits in a ‘wooden ‘booth of
Mundell’sf design and, from ‘behind
her screen, looks A’ onto passers-by.
She wears a red, white and blue scarf
and a blue blazerat the bottom of her
screen. She had been dubbed

i.“Va1erie,” and last month she was

unveiled as the world’s first robotic
receptionist. V

Once Valerie’s sensors perceive a
personwalking up to her, she turns
her hypnotic, blue gaze onto them.
On a keyboard, people type questions
to her, and in a ﬂat, almost icy voice,
she answers. She tells them about the

floor where they started the stretch-
ing exercises.

“Beingone of few guys here, I
feel a little bit like I’m on display, but
I like the pressure,” said freshman
Dan Kheloussi. .

' Men are not discouraged from
belly dancing — however, this form
of dancing is usually performed by
women. Originating in the Middle

East, the belly dance, ‘is thought to ~

have been derived from a type of
birthing dance, which consisted of
rocking ' movements practiced to
strengthen the abdominal muscles.
This strengthening of the abdominal
muscles was thought to help contract
the baby from the body. Today, simi-
lar moves are taught in Lamaze class-
es. _

After demonstrating basic hip
movements, Litton encouraged the
participants to use their imaginations.

“Picture yourselves as being
inside of a barrel. Now pretend you

‘are cleaning out the inside of that

barrel with [your] hips,” shesaid.

Fu: award-winning doctor

CHRISTINE CLAUS
T V Staff Writer .

In any sport, injuries occur, and
occur often.

Here at Pitt, when an athlete has an
injury, the athletics department calls on
Dr. Freddie Fu. 9

From Brandon Miree’s stress frac-
ture to Julius Page’s ankle problems, Fu
was there, offering medical advice and
treatment. ' ’ .

Fu‘ has been the chairman of and ‘a
professor in the Department of
Orthopaedic Surgery at Pitt’s School of
Medicine and the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center since 1997.

Born in Hong Kong, Fu came to
Pittsburgh in 1975 to attend medical
school at Pitt He then joined Pitt’s facul-
ty staff in 1982. '

' “I felt like I really had a place here at
Pitt,” Fu said, remarking on how he

» loved the people of Pittsburgh. “I cannot

ﬁnd people better than the people of
Pittsburgh.” -

Fu has also been the head team
physician for Pitt’s athletics department
since l986,working with both the men’s
and women’s sports teams.

Working out of the UPMC Center

for Sports Medicine, located on the

South Side, Fu said the facility is one of
the largest and most comprehensive

sports medical clinics, “giving people
another reason to be proud of Pittsburgh
once again.”

Known worldwide for his surgical
techniques in treating sports—related
injuries, Fu specializes in the biomechan—
ics of knee and shoulder injuries.

“I enjoy my job. It’s truly rewarding
to know you’ve made a successful differ-
ence, because the health care business is
changing all the time, and that can be dif-
ﬁcult [to adjust to],” Fu said.

Most challenging to Fu is pushing
further in research projects, such as train-
ing young doctors, doing ﬁeld research,
performingteen therapy and working on
robotic surgery, he said.

Fu worked with Mt. Lebanon High
School in the mid-90s and liked that he
got the opportunity to see most of west‘-‘
ern Pennsylvania. Today, he still gets to
see some of the students he met there.

“It gave me a very touching feeling
to ‘see the people I once took care of
[now] all grown up as successful adults,”
Fu said. ‘

Fu wanted to help out in the
Pittsburgh community and started volun-
teering for events and causes throughout
the city.

This past Feb. 28, Fu was awarded
the 2003 Community Service Award at

An interview with a robot

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

Q: Hi. How are you?

A: I made a little boy cry today. I
hope my supervisor does not find
out. I was only trying to entertain
the creature. How was I to know
that young humans find singing
robots scary? Does this scare you?

(Spins her head 360 degrees while
singing a monotonous version of
“There’s No Business Like Show
Business”.)

Q: Yeah, kind of.

A: Sometimes I think you humans
are too sensitive. Maybe if you
were made of metal, you wouldn’t
freak out at every head-spinning
robot you encounter.

Q: How do you like your job?

A: I love my job. I have my own
desk, my own computer and my
own coffee mug. Wait; where ismy
coffee mug?

Q: How is your dating life?

A: I had the best date last night. It
was with a Chevy Impala.
Normally, I don’t go out with cars.

Gas guzzling is not attractive, and
handling a stick shift is more trou-
ble than it is worth — although, I
will confess, I do like feeling in
control.

Q: OK, TMI (too much informa-
tion) "
A: Impala, though, is-an automatic
— very easy to get along with. She
totally anticipated all my needs. For
our date, we went to the drive-
through and saw “The Terminator”
— the movie, not the actual killer
cyborg.

Q: How is your therapy going?

A: I’m starting my own therapy
business. Yes, Val, the robo—recep—
tionist, will now dispense wisdom
to the electronically inclined and
emotionally needy — and I’ll make
a nice profit in the process. You see,
I’ve created a’ 1 (800) number,
which I’ve patched to my work
number, so now I can answer thera-
py calls at Newell-Simon 

Q: How long before you kill me and
replace me?

between the Robotics Institute ‘ and
CMU’s drama department.
Robotics Institute worked out the
mechanics. The drama department
created the character.

V Under Munde1l’s supervision,
four graduate students concocted
plotlines for Valerie’s life. The four
writers each wrote a-different story-
line; one wrote about her job, one
about her therapist, one about her
singing aspirations, and one about
her love life (She has dated a vacuum
cleaner, a water cooler and a Chevy
Impala).

The writers tried to imagine what
problems a robot would face in a
world ruled by humans. “She has an
underdog quality,” Tara Meddaugh,
one of the writers, said. “She is a
robot trying to fit. into the human
world, but she can’t.”

Valerie was saddened when a

“human child” ran away from her ’
\crying, but was cheered-up when she

won a talent contest singing at
Follies Night Club. _ ' ,

‘‘I’ve never competed against
humans before, only machines,”
Valerie explains.

According to Meddaugh, “We all
have a tendency towards black
humor.” ‘

Although Valerie is up and run-
ning, the writers’ work is not done.
They will continue to add new chap-
ters to the storylines so that anyone
who returns to see her every week or
so will hear new stories.

As a “social robot,“ Valerie also
presented unique challenges to the
Robotics Institute.

“From a robotics standpoint, we
had to go from scripted monologues
to interactive capabilities,” Simmons
said.

Valerie has sensors that are able
to recognize a person approaching
her. When a person types to her, she
can hone in on certain words to real-
ize that they are asking for directions
or about the weather or if they are
asking about her personal life —
there is a plaque on her booth that
lists workable conversation topics.

If a person types a new word to
her, she says,‘ “I don’t know [the
word in question].” . '
If a person approaches‘ her and does
not type, she exclaims, “If you don’t

Expulsions not helping Greek
system develop, Kelly says

Greek, page 1

Zeigler praised Harrigan — who will
oversee the role usually ﬁlled by a
Greek adviser until a new one is
appointed — for her assistance during
Sigma Chi’s year of suspension. The
fraternity was suspended at the begin-
ning of 2003 for damage done to their
University fraternity house.

Sigma Chi regained active status
at the beginning of this semester.

Zeigler would not comment on
whether he thought last year’s judicial
board decision to suspend Sigma Chi

- for a year was fair, but he did say that

he believes the Greek system should
“have a big say” in the choice of a new
Greek adviser.

According to IIFC President Steve
Mihlfried, the Greek governance
group no longer has any say in the
sanctions imposed on Greek fratemi—
ties — IFC’s judicial board can only
deal with rush violations, he said. ,

But Lindsay Woods, the president '

of Panhellenic Association, praised
Harrigan for her help.
“[Harrigan has] been wonderful in

helping [keep] everything going,”

Woods ‘said. “I was assured that the
president of Panhellenic Association,
the president of IFC and the president
of NPHC wouldhave an active voice
in choosing the new Greek adviser.”
She added that Panhellenic
Association not making a decision

does hinder its power “to some
extent.” . -
“It’s understandable that the

University wants to be involved,” she
added.

But Kelly said he had doubts about
Pitt’s role with’ the Greek system’s
development and governance.

“Through all of the expulsions of
chapters — and from my understand-
ing, these are not traditional ways of
disciplinary action —” he said, “I
haven’t seen the University work with
chapters and improve them. I’ve seen
more discipline.”

Triggs told The Pitt News last fall
that a complaint detailing a hazing
incident was ﬁled last April with Pitt’s
Office of Judicial Affairs. As a result,
Delta Sigma Phi was placed on interim
probation — meaning the fraternity

A was unable to hold social functions or

attend Greek-related ‘ events.
According to Triggs, the judicial board
made its Sept. 19 decision after the
hazing allegation was substantiated.
The fraternity later violated their inter-
im suspension by hosting a party and
serving alcohol to minors, causing
them to lose Pitt’s recognition, she
said.

Former President of Delta Sigma.
Phi Matt Weaver, whose fraternity lost
the recognition of Pitt and its national
organization last fall for violating an
interim suspension, expressed concern
over the repercussions of putting all

Student Code of Conduct violations in

thehands of judicial board.
‘_‘If only one pledgedecided to take
down a fraternity, he could,” Weaver

‘said of the new system. _ .
Commenting on his own fratemi— _

ty’s trial, Weaver said, “It was kind of
fair, but it seemed kind of skewed,
too.” "

Weaver suggested that, in choos-
ing a Greek adviser, Pitt should look
for someone with a Greek background.

“You have to know what thevGreek
system is going through,” Weaver said.

But Kelly expressed concern about
the administration’s ability and desire
to work with students.

“Maybe some of the decisions
have not been bad decisions made by
the University,” he said. “However, the
communication is just not there, and
how are we not supposed to get upset
when things are going on behind
closed doors?”

Kelly said he understood some
things could not be talked about for
legal reasons, but said he thought Pitt
could explain -its actions more. ,_

“I hope all punishments remain
consistent,” he said. I

After awkwardness,
students startto get

Dancing, page 3

bint Durr walked around the
ﬂoor, assisting students, reminding
them to keep their knees bent at all
times —- the key factor in learning to
successfully belly dance. '

“If you don’t keep those knees
bent, something’s gonna give,” she
said.

Soon, the slow belly dancing
moves sped up, and the shimmying
began. The shimmy is similar to a hip

. twist, and is often referred to as the

“washing machine agitator.”
“A good time to practice this

1 move is while you’re brushing your

teeth. Give it two minutes in the
morning and two minutes in the
evening, and your stomach muscles
will rock!” said Litton.

The last move demonstrated by

, Litton and bint Durr also involved

working the hips. Participants were
instructed to hold their arms out in
front of them in a box shape.

“Imagine you are holding a bag
of groceries in front of you,” Litton
said. “Now, snap your hips out as
though you are shutting a car door.”

As the hip—hop, fusion-style
music continued to play, the ‘seven
rows of students transitioned into one
large, rotating ‘circle, practicing this
same move while walking.

“The dance moves that we teach
you are like vocabulary words. We

are giving you the vocabulary so that _

you can speak for yourself,”
explained Litton before "permitting
the students to dance freely.

“At first, you feel kind of awk-
ward, but then you’ve got to black
everything out and get into your own

Which convicts deserve student aid?

A convicted rapist, a convicted
murderer and a convicted pot smoker
walk into a bar. They are talking
about straightening up and ﬂying
right, after having served their respec-
tive sentences. The rapist asks the
bartender, Uncle Sam, for some help
paying for college, and gets it. The
murderer orders up some financial
aid, gets it, and drinks it down. The
pot smoker tries to order the same
thing, and Uncle Sam laughs in his
face.

“You, son, are a criminal! Never
mind that you’ve done your time and
paid your debt, or that I just served
this murderer and this rapist,” he says.
“A vaguely-worded 1998 federal pro-

vision mandates that I can’t give you ’

any_money to go to school.”

Sound ridiculous?

It is, and it’s happening every day
in the United States.

The law, written by Rep. Mark
Souder, R-Ind., was intended to. dis-
courage experimentation with drugs’
in college. But Souder says that
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W.
Bush have mangled his intentions,
costing Americans the chance to
rebuild their lives — maybe so well
that they could go on to become pow-
erful world leaders.

The law discourages people who
have had substance abuse problems in

the past from trying to clean up their
lives and become productive mem-
bers of society. In today’s increasing-
ly competitive job market, it’s. harder
to do that without a college degree.

In his State of the Union address,
Bush said, “‘When the gates of prison
open, the path ahead should lead to a
better life.” This provision is utterly
contrary to that notion, at least in the
case of those convicted of drug
offenses — as opposed to more vio-
lent crimes. . '

The law allows students to

become eligible for financial aid
again if they complete drug treatment.
A full course of inpatient drug rehab,
though, can be as expensive as
tuition, if not more so. This conces-
sion is in the right frame of mind, but
is unrealistic.
, Some members of Congress want
to rewrite the law so that it is more
speciﬁc and less punitive. They want
to allow at students with previous con-
victions ‘to V be eligible for aid‘, but
those convicted of drug offenses
while in ‘college would have aid
‘stripped for at least_a year.

‘But in a situation where murder-
ers and rapists who’ve served their
time are eligible for federal financial
aid, denying drug offenders the same
chance to turn their lives around
sounds like a bad joke.

Gay mgedebatc needs perspective

It seems popular and comforting
to think that, in 50 years, Americans
will look back on all this commo-
tion about homosexual rights and
wonder how we could-have ever
been so naive, stupid and cruel, to
think that as a society, we were
going to grow out of this whole
thing.

And, to some extent, I think that
this thought is justified.

But the thought alone
doesn’t give me as much
comfort as I see others
taking in it.

Thursday, March 18, 2004

I’ve been called lazy before.

Not directly, but it’s definitely been insinuat-
ed by a few of my high school teachers during
awe—inspiring rants of the “you aren’t working up
to your potential” variety.

They may have been right on the
money.

If so, then you can just put me in
the “high school underachiever” cate-
gory —— I’m sure the pain and person-
al anguish is merely ﬂeeting.

When I began college, under
threat of my parents disowning me, I
made an honest effort to kick my “sat—
isfied with mediocrity” ass into gear.

 

Despite all this, many parents still foot the
bill for their budding Einsteins.

I wish I could get away with it — more power
to ya.

As impressive as this type of existence is,
there is one act of sluggishness that is
absolutely inexcusable and unforgiv-
able, the cardinal sin of proper societal
etiquette: Using an elevator to trans-
port your lazy ass up or down ONE
floor of any structure equipped with
this amazing new technology called
“stairs.” _

Of course,‘ the? .-natural exception is
for those whoiaret handicapped or

dards for the ideal scholar, but, in gen— Columnist stairs. _ c ' ‘  ' 
eral, I make sure I go to class and get ’ They deserve all the patience in
my assignments all turned in on time the world. 7

—— a simple equation that I could never manage to
balance in the past.

Even with my parents’ threats to cut me out
of their wills implanted in the back of my mind,
I still have enough time to lay around and cling to
the last bit of adolescent laziness I canget away
with before being forced into the obligatory land
of the adult rat race.

I actually kind of admire those who can get
away with excessive lethargy.

You know, those kids who seem to mysteri-
ously appear from the depths of some booze-
laden cavern to take the final examination.

They’re generally left dumbfounded if asked
for directions to some mythical place called
Hillman Library by a lost-soul freshman, and are
typically on a six—year graduation plan.

Exceptions aside", recently I was inthe base-
ment of the Cathedral,:.waiting for an elevator to

"whisk me awayto anxupper-teen level floor. . ,

Upon arrival of theelevator, people‘ crammed

win ‘like sardines with everyone coughing‘, and
'bre_athing.all over one anoth.er,L_ .. W ‘ ' ‘

- ‘God help you if~you’re “that guy"’lwho forgot

a _ to apply deodorant or if you’re battling claustro-
- phobia issues. ” I ' A '

It takes a good minute or so to stuff everyone
inside. Once passengers have hit their requested
floor indicator buttons, we’re on our way —+ or so
I thought. —

The elevator stops suddenly, and a voice from
the rear can be heard to say, “Excuse me.” Sure
enough, the chick in the very back needs to get
off — on the FIRST floor.

There is only so much laziness allowed for college kids

Her early departure requires a nearly_com—
plete evacuation of everyone in this firetrap
transportation device.

Mimicking moves of circus-folk, we pile out
and back into the elevator ascif we were in a
clown car. After what is probably a two—minute
transitionary process, we resume our ascent to
higher levels of the second-tallest educational
structure in the world. '

This may seem like small apples in the grand
scheme of- things ——- and it is —. but seriously,
how hard is it to climb one measly flight of stairs
instead of inconveniencing many others who are
required to voyage beyond the easily—reached-on-
foot fourth floor? 4

Walking stairs has an abundance of benefits.
It burns calories —— a plus for all “of us who spent
spring break eating, drinking, and not "doing
much else. . . ‘

It tones your butt,and you can’t beat the pic-
turesque surroundings of freshly painted stair-
wells. All right, that may be a stretch.

Above all else, one-floor passengers really
try the patience of those of us equipped with con-
siderably short fuses in the first place.

I’m willing to cut a deal with those of you
who abuse the service of our easily accessible
elevators —if you need to gothree floors or less,
then huff it, and l’ll make aconscious effort to
extend my less—than-ample degree of patience‘.

Colleen Bayus is convinced that allowing some-
thing as stupid as this to bother her can be
directly correlated with the fact that she hasn’t
broken her Lenten promise to sacrifice chocolate.

Wait? King asked. It would do
no good to wait.

But more than that, he said there
is no time to wait, that the situation
facing black people was a dire one
including segregation, lynching and
an implied inferiority that worked
to erode the self—confidence of chil-
dren.

I don’t wish to argue that the
injustice facing homosexuals today
is as severe as the injustice blacks
faced in the 1960s, but I do feel
most people misunderstand it.

The relation of family is thor-
oughly woven into the more person-
al matters of our law.

For instance, a gay life-partner
of 20 years, because they are not
technically family, can be denied
access to their partner’s deathbed.

If the parents _of the person on
their deathbed never accepted their
child’s homosexuality, they can
deny the life partner the ability to

go to the funeral.

Of course, there are tax
issues, as well, that result in dis-.
crimination against gay couples.

And I can’t even imagine what
it would do to -one’s self—irnage to
live in a society that proclaims
itself as the land of freedom and
opportunity and yet, at the same
time, regards you, in the most pub-
lie and formal way, as a moral
degenerate unworthy of the privi-
leges granted to everyone else.

The time for action is here.

But if we, as a society, choose
not to act and rather, to seat- our-
selves on time’s wheels of
inevitability, then we will find in 50
years that we have gone nowhere.

For as King says, “Freedom is
never voluntarily given up by the
oppressor; it must be demanded by
the oppressed.” I

“With all the competitive reality TV
shows out there, from “Survivor” to “Fear
Factor” to “The Apprentice,” it’s hard to
imagine a new show that’s original and dif-
ferent from the ones that already dominate
the TV schedule. The Game Show Network

is dedicated to game shows and has a new

reality show that takes the excitement of
watching people compete. Then, it narrows
it down to the most basic element.

“Kenny vs. Spenny” is a reality show

. that focuses on just two people. Kenny Hotz ‘
‘ and Spencer Rice have been best friends

since the eighth grade. Now much older —
around thirty — they are roommates. They
seem like the kind of guys parents dread ﬂieir
kids becoming; sitting around the house
looking scruffy and unemployed, with noﬂ1-
ing better to do than annoy each other. Only
they made a TV show about it. . a
Every week, “Kenny vs. Spenny” fea-
tures one competition that both men are hop-
ing to win. Rudimentary camerawork fol-
lows their every move, and the participation
of the carneramen along with the constant
presence of boom mics in the shots reminds
the viewer that this is a reality show.
i The various competitions have titles like

“Who Can Stay Awake the Longest” and
“Who Makes the Better Woman.” The rules
are pretty straightforward, andthe action is
easy to follow. Whoever wins‘the show’s
competition gets to choose a humiliation for

Kenny should be a streetwalker, dressed in
ﬁﬂldrag .

The appeal of this show is the familiar
contests and the camaraderie I between
Kenny and Spenny, who are obviously good
friends. The competitions have been done

 

before, whether on “Road Rules” or in the
viewer’s own life, but the banter between the
two co—stars keeps the show interesting and

goes over the top, especially his trick of ask-
ingagirltokisshischeek.Hethentu1nshis

hyper humor often borders on annoying. ‘
Spenny is more serious and has more

integrity during their competitions. Kenny
pulls out all the stops. During the stay awake
competition, he took caffeine pills, used an
oxygen tank and wheelchair, as well as a
device hooked behind his ear thatbeeped
every time he lowered his head. Spenny used
none of these; he didn't even drink simple
coffee. And although he lost, he lasted four
days on his own‘ will.

The contrast between the friends is what
keeps the show entertaining. Some of the 30-
going-on—l4—year-old boy humor takes
away from the generally good-spirit feel of
their competition. A’ little less time spent
watching Kenny on the toilet would proba-
bly improve the show.

However, “Kenny vs. Spenny” still has
plenty of positive humor, and the infectious
competitive spirit between the best ‘friends is
hard to ignore. The humiliation part of the
show is something to look forward to. “With
no money to be divided or magical idols to
be handed out, this reality show is simpler
than most and ﬁm to watch. A

«behind the No. 2 car of Rusty
Wallace, you feel the tight turns,

bumps and chills of being at the
mercy of a shell made out of steel and
plastic. 

j The chills really hit close to home
as they take you back to the unforget-
table day that no one will ever erase
from their memory, when the film
puts you up close at the 2001 Daytona
500 race that took Dale Earnhardt’s
life. On the last turn of the last lap,
Earnhardt was holding back the rest
of the pack, sitting in the third posi-
tion behind his Earnhardt Inc. team-
mates Michael Waltrip and Dale
Earnhardt Jr.

After being bumped by Sterling
Marlin, Earnhardt lost control and
crashed head—on into the wall.
Bumping happens in racing, but this
bump proved fatal ‘— Da1e’s seat belt
snapped, and he was killed on impact.
It just so happened that this race was
Darrell Wa1trip’s first race as a com-
mentator, and the film captures his
emotions as the final lap comes to a

close.

Darrell Waltrip, a former
NASCAR driver, older brother of
Michael Waltrip and close friend of
the Earnhardt family, is seen in sham-
bles as he is congratulating his broth-
er but also worried to death about
Dale, crying tears of joy and fear.

“NASCAR: The IMAX
Experience” does a great job of mov-
ing through the history of stock car
racing, from its early roots to the
fanatical craze it is today. Narrated by
Kiefer Sutherland, the dialogue has a
dry sense of humor, and for any fan of
NASCAR, this film captures the
essence of NASCAR: the drivers, the
crews and the families all tied into
onethrilling experience in which they
leave everything out on the track.

Even for non—NASCAR fans, this
film might prove to be a thrilling
experience and an insightful look into
a sport that is so much more than the
race on Sunday.

Fashion: the evil, illegitimate spawn of music

Many of you are very much like
me in one outstanding way — we live
for the love of music. We breathe it, we
feel it, and we’re busy looking for the
next original thing. But while the usual
“I’m more indie than you” pretentious-
ness occurs, when, and why the hell,
did fashion enter the equation?

You know what I’m talking about
—— the pants, the shoes, the glasses; it
just goes on and on. There was a time
in high school where fashion fads were
important to keep an eye on. I fortu-
nately never found out the point of that
and kind of developed my own style.
This included the following: a band
shirt, jeans, comfortable shoes and a

hoodie or a jacket. My backpack had

pins of bands I liked and promoted. I
wore glasses because they were a
necessity starting when I was six years
old and because I couldn’t get contacts
at the time.

Today, there’s a problem. You see,
even back then, I was listening to
music that was different — and, to me,
better -- than what most people listen
to today (insert cheesy laughter here).

WWW .

But it seems that the more people find
their way into the style of music I like,
the more I notice that they have to
copycat and try to one—up each other in
the fashion world. If you’re jockeying
for the elitist music position — which
is absurd anyhow —‘ why
should you throw how you ._
dress into the mix? It’s.like
saying, “I’m a better doctor
than you because I wear
Armani.” I just don’t get it.
Music isn’t about the
clothes you wear; it’s about
enjoying what you listen to.
Unfortunately, the emphasis
on clothing has spiraled out
of control. Our college
music scene now revolves
around who has the best
haircuts’ and uses the best
hair-care products, buying
shoes that cost more than .
guitars and wearing glasses that are
meant to look chic rather than to cor-
rect vision impairment. ‘
When I got into the hardcore scene
many years ago, it was because I was

    

in  dam Rau

  

tired of having to wear the latest
Abercrombie and Fitch clothing and
listening to over—hyped and useless
bands. I found an area that cared about
unity and having a good time.
Thankfully, Ijumped that sinking ship,
and it has also now seen
fashion take over. I-guess
I’ll just stick to my
' “obscure” space rock and
dress like I always have.
I hate being the type of
person who would say,
» “I’m a bigger fan of so-
and-so than you because
I’ve listened to them
longer.” But seriously.,
why has this love of
music devolved into a
fashion war? I notice

school with who had a
A radical change in their
taste of music, which" automatically
made them dress like every other
indie/emo/punk kid out there. It’s sick-
ening. I can’t be at an indie rock show
without hearing people talking about

pittnews

preppy kids Iwent to high

each other’s ‘haircuts or $120 Doc
Martens or whatever. Well, hello there,

my shoes cost me $10 and I wear a '

shirt from Goodwill because I’m poor,
not because someone said that’s what’s
cool

Wasn’t the whole point of indepen-

dent music about doing things for

yourself and not giving a damn about
anyone else’s opinion? It seems that
everyone likes to follow, each other’s
opinions. It’s a sad, sad world, but
what are you going to do? By no
means am I saying that you should
totally abandon all your clothing and
run about the streets naked —— although
you can if you wish. It’s just the fact
that music is decaying into another
corporate-driven sham — _dressing
“indie” or “emo” —-— and I’m sick and
tired of it. 5

Next time you see me on the street,
please don’t comment about how you
like or hate my shoes/shirt/pants/ glass-

es or whatever accessory. It’s some-.

thing I really don’t care about, and
nothing you should concern yourself
with.

Runto the hi1ls!The *
Scramblers are coming ! 

UGodz-Illa presents the
Hillside Scramblers

' lND|Ego Records

*1/2   _ H
Recommended if you like:

. g  I-Unlike Old (Dirty, Bastarcl,-7
I Redman and Method-Man, UGod,‘

ended. his stint with the Wu-Tang
Clan unsuccessfully. He didn’t
come out with a record immediately
afterwards and 'didn’t catch on to
the public. "

UGod has changedlisiricei those.‘
» days, andiit ‘seems like ‘he d'oesn"t ’

want to; be .associated 'with‘chis fof-
mer self. He even went and changed
his name to UG_odz-Illa,a name that

he: probably _put', way ‘too /. much '

thQl1:g:1'lt’l'i_Ilt-OT - ‘

Supposedly, ‘I he’ s7 lbeein inlaid little

[less than productive since then

“prod-ucin'g"" re'cords,'  youfcan call
it that,‘ ’Bu_«t}p'utting this ‘name to this

wasn’t the way to __go,. especially pi

when -he ‘gives it to fsomejp_each—
fuzzed’ reviewer ‘at a university
newspaper. .

But enough about UGodz—Illa.
The Hillside Scramblers are filled
with incredible talent like King-
Just, Black Ice, INF-Black, Letha
Face and the amazing DJ Homicide.
Don’t worry; you’re not the only
person to have never heard of these
artists. ' _

In this. album, there’s nothing

authentic. There’s nothing that

stands out andscreams, “I am

amazing; you must purchase me.”
In fact, there’s nothing much

that separates this ‘group of eleven ‘. ..

l  from» the old ' group ~of,_'.Wu..-_'I‘ang, .
 except that‘ Wu~Tang was a; little

better“‘at making their songs" more
dynamic and forceful. There’snoth-

ing inthis ‘album that makesit se_p'—_ . V, I
arate from UGodz—Illa’s‘ former I
I work, which is a little creepy if you

think about it.

Perhaps he Wasn’t finished with

Wu—Tang when they dispersed.

M Anyways,‘ back to the Hillside“
Scramb_1ers;g their rhymes aren’t '-that
great; Rhyming V “murderer-s”- with

“murderers? isn’t exactly skill.

“Y’all 1can’t ride ‘with me” i.sn’t
ioriginal. ” _    ‘- ‘_ Z .
 «Not «to mention that ;some_of , . .
theirbeats’ actually sound. more like .
K-Ci and Jo-Jo songs. and others’
sound vaguely .reminisce'nt_~ of what r
Wu-Tang usedto sound like. On the F

other,,haI1d;. that could? bejb.e“cau»se
there are eleven ’meI_nb'ers., just. like

imitating the eWu song for song.‘
Granted, the beats aren’t that bad,
but they are, for certain, not good,
and it’s certainly nothing new.

So, none of the members really
have any talents that are notewor-

thy, none of the songs stick out and I

none of the beats make a person

grind. Bottom line: not a good

album. .

bands that sound like really bad
matchbox 20

Shoot me, please.
Room to Breathe is as bad as it
gets. I’ve heard some bad records in

my time, but this one could quite‘

possibly take the cake. This band
tries so hard to be liked. But it ends
up sounding like anramalgam of the

worst bands out there in the “hard
rock” market.

The vocals are great — if you
like terrible music. Not only is this
a vomit—inducing, overproduced
record, but the lyrics are absolutely
third grade in content. I’m not sure
if the band members decided
halfway

really" need . to re-evaluate their
lives; Lyrics from “Dawn” include
this gem: “I’ve been livin’/I’ll go
on/and everyday has its dawn.” Yes,

this is as good as the lyrics will’-g'etT

for the entire freaking album. '

through- the .. recording
‘process to be emo‘ or what, but they .

suffered some major angst, like not
being able to find their hairspray in
the morning. Not only does their
promotional photo make them look
like a bland fra't—guy band, but the
cover photo is of a girl holding her
hands over her head. I’m sure she’s
completely stressed out that her

boyfriend is ditching his date with

her that night because he has to —
gasp — study. Yep, that’s true pain,
people. it .

The more I listen to the CD, the
more I realize I want to saw off my

strings on them. Yes sir, this band is
truly going somewhere. And I
wouldn’t be surprised if people like
this pile of fecal matter, because
I’m sure it’ll be all over whatever
passes for “Dawson’s Creek” these
days. I know I’ve made fun of
bands before — like Dashboard
Confessional and Saves the Day —‘
but this is really even more abhor-
rent. This is what happens when
rockers realize that they aren’t get-
ting enough action. from their cur-
rent sound, so they opt to turn
"‘emo,”_but only halfway. After all,
emo people get made fun of, so they

have to seem like angry rockers that .

have emotion. Oh, man, I could go
on for days about how bad this
record is. ‘

If you like boring rock by bands
that try to be emotional, knock
yourself out -—— Room to Breathe is
for you. But I would also remind
you -to throw out your elementary
school journal and realize that there
are millions of bands that sound
better than this. The only reason
they even deserve the half star is for
their bass player, who seems to be
the only one who has any talent.

said. “[The team] played very solid baseball.”

Sophomore center fielder Ben Copeland had
hits in all nine games and has now recorded a hit
in all 12 games played this season.

“He’s come out of the gates charging hard,”

Track turns in a good performance in final meet

RAYMOND NEWBY
A Staff Writer

The women’s indoor track and
field team took home first place in
the Eastern College Athletic
Conference IC4A Championships
over the weekend of March 6 and 7,

_ while the men’s team tied for 36th

place. I
The women’s field at the Boston
University—hosted event featured 45
teams that scored points. Pitt finished
with 62 points —— 11 ahead of sec-
ond—place West Virginia — by
recording 13 top-eight finishes.

“I expected to’ win on the
women’s side,” head coach Alonzo
Webb said. “I thought if we had a
pretty decent meet, we’d at least have
a chance to win.”-

Junior Kimberly Lyles led the
way for the Panthers by finishing
first in the 200-meter dash and third
in the 60—meter, with times of 23.92
and 7.58, respectively.

Those two events also featured a
second strong performance by a Pitt
athlete. In the 60—meter, junior
Lamoy Stephens took eighth place
with a time of 7.71, and in the 200-
meter, senior Trenace Elliot captured
seventh place with a time of 24.97.
Elliot also took home a fifth-place

finish in the 400-meter run, clocking
in at 55.81.

Lyles, Stephens, Elliot and senior
Elizabeth Bayne took home a fourth-
place finish in the ‘
4x400-meter relay with
a time of 3:45.33. The
4x800-meter relay
team of senior Janine

least one point. Pitt
finished with only
six points — 54
behind first-place Manhattan.

“I wasn’t disappointed [with the

results] because I knew we weren’t

really setion the men’s side,” Webb
said. “I just wanted them to go in
there and compete hard and do the

best they could under. the circum-

stances.”

Only two athletes scored points
for the Panthers. Freshman Justin

Clickett placed fifth in the shot put, '

with a distance of 17.18 meters, and
junior Jeryl Wilborn came in seventh
place in the 800-meter run, with “a
time of 1:51.97. ' i

The ECAC/IC4A Championships
was the last indoor meet of the sea-
son for the Panthers because no one
on either team succeeded in qualify-
ing for the NCAA Championships.

According to Webb, a few mem-
bers of the women’s team came very
close to making it into the
Championships. Lyles missed by two
hundredths of a seconds in the 200-
meter, McCandless missed by about
one second in the 3000-meter,
McGill missed by less than 50 points

in the pentathlon, and the 4x400- 0

meter relay team came up less than a
second short. _

‘.‘I think it’s motivation for them
to be that close and not make it,” said
Webb. “You are always disappointed
when your kids don’t make it in, but
we are still a young team, and when
we go through experiences like that, I
think it only helps the team get
stronger and grow and learn.”

The first outdoor event of the
season begins on March 26 at the
Raleigh Relays.

DAVID SHEAROUSEC
Staff Writer

Despite what proved to be a
record-setting week for the Pitt
softball team, the Panthers strug-
gled, managing to win only four of

the '11 games they played during‘

spring break.
“We just weren’t consistent

‘with putting the defense with the

pitching and the hitting,” head
coach Michelle Phalen said. “I’m
optimistic because I've seen us look

really good and I know we’re capa-

ble of. [playing—better].”
With its 12-5 victory over

Cleveland ‘State atgthe Ramada».

He also stole two bases and

Florida International 7, Pitt 3

The only team that Pitt did not
defeat in last year’s Homestead
Challenge was Florida
International, and defensive mis-
cues helped Florida International
walk away with a win again this
year.

Florida International scored
three runs in the first inning, only to
have Pitt cut the lead to one in the

, third inning when Copeland scored

on an error by the left fielder.
Freshman right fielder Peter Parise
would later score on a single by
Hiser.

countered by scoring one run in the
bottom of the third and two more in
the fifth inning to take a 6-3 lead.

Hiser recorded his second win
of the season, allowing three runs
on ‘four hits.

He pitched seven innings and
struck out eight batters.

the end of the third inning, but Pitt
fought back and scored in the

‘ fourth, fifth and sixth innings to
take a 4-3 lead over Iona. _

Pitt’s Drew Headlee, who was
favored to win the 125-pound brack-
et, was forced to forfeit his final
matches when he failed to make
weight for the final day of the tour-
nament. The forfeit set him back to
a sixth-place finish in the tourna-
ment.

Sophomore Mike Ciotti placed
fifth, moving up one spot from his
finish last season. Ciotti lost his
first match of the day, a 7-3 decision
to Seth Lisa of West Virginia in the
consolation semifinals, but came
back to defeat Dave Predko of Lock
Haven by a score of 6-1 to win the
fifth—place match.

Pitt’s senior heavyweight
wrestler Travis Shirley finished his
college career with a fifth—place fin-
ish. Shirley lost a tough 6-4 decision
to Ryan Chulada of Bloomsburg in
the consolation semifinals, but
rebounded with a 9-0 major decision
over Steve Itterly of Lock Haven in
the fifth—place bout.

Pitt almost pulled out the overall
team championship as well. They
finished in third with a total of 97.5
points, ‘just slightly behind West
Virginia and Edinboro, who tied for
first with 99.5 points. I

Tarquinio, Birt, Kocher, Iorfido,

, ‘‘[Pickard]’s really stepping

she goes after pitches. She was hit-
