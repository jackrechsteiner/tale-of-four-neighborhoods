Bidding on empty bowls
symbolic of hunger issue

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Staff Writer

People milled about folding tables,
picking up clay bowls, scrutinizing them
and then putﬁng them back down.

Some bowls were clearly made by
professionals, with the rims perfectly
round and the basins even, while others
were slightly lopsided or bumpy around
the edges.

Some people chose to look for specif-

’ ic colors in the bowls, while others looked

for uniqueness in shape, such as one bowl
with sides designed to resemble ﬂower
petals and a yellow circle painted in the
bottom.

A diverse crowd of college students, '

families and senior citizens had gathered
for the ninth armual Empty Bowls Dinner,
a fimdraising event for Just Harvest, an
organization that ﬁghts to end hunger, and
the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food
Bank ,

Each ticket, costing $18 in advance
and $20 at the door, could be exchanged
for one of hundreds of clay bowls in
“every size, shape, and color,” said Ken
Regal, co-director of Just Harvest

Local high school and college stu-

dents, community groups, and profession-
al potters donated the bowls. .

“You bring home your bowl as a sym-
bol of those whose xbowls are empty,”
Regal said.

One man made his way through the
crowd with the aid of his seeing—eye dog.
Once he had approached a table, he picked
up a greenish bowl and skimmed his ﬁn-
gers over the bumpy sides before setting
the bowl back down.

Several other tables were set up on the
side, displaying bowls available for silent
auction. The bowls ranged in estimated
market value from $15 all the way to $300.

“IfI get it, I get it. IfI don’t, I don’t,”
one woman could be heard saying as her
female companion told her she should
have bid more for a bowl.

But the attendees could not take all
day to choose. The tempting smell of
hearty soup wafted through the air, beck-
oning them toward the soup line ‘in the
adjacent room.

Not only were they given a clay bowl
in exchange for their entry fees, but also a
seemingly endless supply (250 gallons, to
be exact)_of soup.

ZBT tryingto dig itself out

ZBT, page 1

they soon received word that they would
have to face the judicial board regarding
the alleged break-in that happened in
their University complex.

While the judicial board met on Feb.
5 to discuss ZBT’s case, maintenance
workers were already installing a new
door for the cleaning-supply closet —- a
door that ZBT wastold to pay for.

At the hearing, board officials rec-
ommended that ZBT pay $417.40 in
restitution for the cost of a door that ﬂie
brothers say they never damaged.
Additionally, the board also recom-
mended that the brothers hold a risk-

management seminar for the entire’

Greek community. .

Stotish thought that would be the
end of it. Then, on Feb. 9, he received a
letter from Daniel.

While upholding the recommended
sanctions suggested by the judicial
board, Daniel also suspended the frater-
nity for an additional six-month period.
Daniel has told The Pitt News in the past
week that he carmot comment on judicial
affairs.

.ZBT has been on social probation
since May 1, 2003, after an incident
involving an underage person 
at one of their parties. ‘

“We weren’t controlling our par-

ties,” Stotish said.

As a result, the fraternity was put on
probation, which would have ended on
April 30, 2004, before the six~month
extension. They were also required to
hold a risk—management seminar, which

they held this fall. In addition, each ZBT 5 A
brother was required to complete 20,

hours of community service.

“We were in complete compliance »

with trying to get ourselves out of the
hole that we dug,” Stotish said.

The letter warned that any member
who failed to complete the community
service requirement would have a hold
placed on his account.

According to the letter Daniel sent
Stotish, “should ZBT’violate any other
University policies while on Social
Probation [it] will result in immediate
termination of chapter recognition.”

The letter deﬁned social probation
as, “the loss of chapter privileges to host,
sponsor, co-sponsor or participate in any
social activities with non-members
ANYWHERE [sic].” -

Stotish explained that, since the fra
ternity was put on social probation,
members “can’t really do anything.” The
fraternity was unable to attend Greek
Week events or have a formal.

“We can’t even really participate in

Stotish said.

Interfratemity Council President
Steve Mihlfried commented on the sanc-
tions the administration placed on ZBT.

“It seems the University has adopted
a two—strike policy,” Mihlfried said.

Mihlfried expressed his belief that
IFC should have a greater say in frater-
nity sanctions.

“Since IFC officially recognizes the
chapter, IFC should be consulted in mat-

, ters involving chapter recognition,”

part of decision making

Mihlfried said.

He explained that IFC would still
punish fraternities for misbehavior.

. “Even if [judicial board] was under
us, there still would’ve been a ﬁne,”
Mihlfried said. ’

Mihlfried disagreed .with how the
sanctions were enforced.

“Why should a whole chapter have
to pay for the actions of one member?”
he asked. “To place a hold on someone’s
account for being part of a voluntary
organization is like putting a hold on a
basketball player’s account if he doesn’t
show up to practice.”

Singh noted that, at the recent Honors
Convocation, a female speaker, Catherine
DeAngelis, editor in chief of the Journal of
American Medical Association and Pitt
alum, gave the keynote speech

The selection committee receives nom-
inations — normally two to three annually
— through an open process, wherein stu-
dents, faculty members and other people can
suggest a person and provide the committee
members with information about their nom-
inee’s accomplishments. ‘ I

The committee then reviews the nomi-
nees and does their own research on each

. person.

First, the committeemembers ﬁnd a
person who has “tremendous stature” and
great prominence either at a national or inter-
national level. Then, a school or department

E that the selected person is most closely asso-

ciated with at Pitt needs to endorse the com-
rnittee’s decision before it is sent to the chan-

_ cellor for his approval. In essence, if a Well-

known opera singer were to be selected by
the committee, the music department here
would have to approve the decision before
the chancellor could also approve it.

I Despite that process, Professor Ann
Sutherland Harris has described the situation
of only two women being selected as being
“pretty scandalous.” ,

According to Vice Provost Elizabeth
Baranger, more than half of the graduates

receiving bachelors and masters degrees are

women.Anditis important_forthem—as
well as for the men — to see successful
women. She added that it is important for
women to be able to have female role mod-
els and that many women have come to
notice the trend. _

Since there are only two major events
annually — the Honors Convocation and the
graduationceremony — nominees are not
always able to attend, Singh said. However,

there are occasions every few years 4 such
as U.N. Secretary-General Koﬁ Annan’s

A recent visit to Pitt — wherein the chancellor

and provost will bestow an honorary degree
on people unable to attend either of these
armual events when they can visit Pitt’s cam-
pus. . _ .
According to Singh, some of the
women who have been invited and for vari-
ous reasons have been unable to attend
include‘ Sen. Hillary Rodharn Clinton, D-
N.Y., and Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O’Connor, as well as academics includ-
ing Narmerl O. Keohane, the president of
Duke University, and Judith Roden, the
University of Pennsylvania president,
among many other accomplished women.

This, though, is not an adequate expla-‘ '

nation for Harris, who said Pitt should plan
further ahead if scheduling is a problem. '

The committee does not currently seek
out any type of speaker in particular, whether
itbe awoman oraminority.

In recent years, Pitt has hosted black
speakers, including Edelman. V

Harris has suggested that Pitt only look
for women speakers for the next ﬁve years
and then rotate between men and women

armuallyafterﬂrat.

Despite it being an open process, Hanis
has said that she does not think many pwple
know about the selection process and ﬂreir
ability to nominate people.

I Harris had in mind a few prospective
women, such as Maureen Dowd, a New
York Times columnist, Linda Greenhouse, a
Supreme Court reporter, and women
reporters from National Public Radio, such
as Cokie Roberts. She also stressed that the
speaker needs to be good at public speaking
to inspire people. i

'Barangersaidshehasalreadydi.scussed
this matter with the ‘Provost Advisory
Committeeon Women’s Concerns, in which
she and other faculty and staff "members, as
well as students, are involved. -

Cottage cheese causes downfall

E-Week, page 1

Behind two large tables lined with plas— A

tic, the contestants stood waiting for “run-
ners” to bring to them samples of Various
foods from an adjacent table. Team mem-
berstooktumseatingthefooditemsina
timed race, which lasted a few seconds short
of 30 minutes. ‘

Each team was given a total of six bot-
tles of water_ to use sparingly when needed.

“You can drink as much water as you’d '

like —— but that’s all you get,” Haven
instructed. ,

' Nate Phillips, a junior from the civil
engineering department, was the ﬁrst to
throw up after drinking cottage cheese from
a cup; - . ‘ '

“It was the volume of it It wasn’t the

. taste,” he said. “Your gag reﬂex kicks in

when you’re trying to swallow a whole cup-

And Phillips certainly wasn’t ﬂre only
one to get sick. Soon enough, the trash cans
and buckets surrounding the area served
their purpose as students rushed to bring
back up what was quickly inhaled

Freshman Tyesha McPherson wrinkled '

her nose and cupped her hands over her
mouth before rushing to a nearby bucket
moments after drinking a shot of hot sauce
from a Dixie cup. .
' “For me, the hot sauce did it — fol-
lowed by the cup of sweetened condensed
milk,” she explained ' _

The students who crowded arouird to
watch the competition didn’t  in
number when the purging began to rapidly
occur. Instead they offered cheers of encour-
agement and support _

“Don’t even think about it. Just chew,

chew, swallow!” shouted Glinda Harvey, the ~

mechanical engineering graduate secretary.

Initially, the competition was only sup-
posed to last for 15 minutes,’ but halfway
through, Haven decided to let the game con-

tinue until all of the food was consumed._

Contestants were required to eat the food on
plates ﬁrst, and ﬂren ﬁnish off the contents of
cups and bowls.

The last items to be gulped down were
ﬂie beverages — such as milk, Kool-Aid and
soda ‘

As if he was shotgunning a can of beer,

. senior Patrick McCarthy grabbed a pen and

pierced a can of Faygo Red Pop to guzzle it
down faster. This move caused his team, the
Material Science Engineers, to place ﬁrst in
the competition. _

With red soda stains on his face,
McCarthy described what caused him to
throw up midway through the contest.

“The pork rinds did it for me, but they
didn’t come out until I ate the tomato,” he
said ‘

Fellow teammate and winner Carrie
Davis, a senior, had the most diﬁicult time
eating the six slices of dry bread But she
was clever enough to think of a way to ingest
them quickly.

“I just drenched all of the bread in water.
That way, it was slimy and slid down easier,”
she explained.

Rob Buckingham, an E-Week represen-
tative ﬁom the electrical engineering depart-
ment, offered his opinion as to why engi-
neers enjoy such a grotesque event.

“Because we’re sick, twisted people
who never get out of this building!” he
joked. '

In all, the general consensus as to what
triggered st11dents to vomit; the cottage
cheese. V

E-Week continues for the rest of this
week, and concludes with the annual

I Shamrock Ball Friday evening.

and tattoos, people

More than 20’ folding tables were
arranged in rows throughout the room,
adorned with paper-bag‘ centerpieces and
red, green, yellow, pink, orange and blue
balloons. .

Throughout the four-hour event, the
types of soup were rotated so that atten-
dees could choose from 6 different vari-
eties at any one time, including] chicken
noodle, wedding and mushroom-barley

’ soups.

As the adults stood in line, trays in
hand, the children opted to seek out the
entertaimnent.

In a corner of the room, Mike “The
Balloon Gu ” Evans twisted a blue bal-
loon into a mini sword for an onlooking lit-
tle. boy. ‘ A

“Oh, yeah,” the boy shouted as he
thrust the sword toward an older girl, who
fended him off with her own sword.

After they tired of the play, the girl
rolled up one of the sleeves of her blue T-
shirt and waited in line to get an airbrushed
tattoo.

And as the attendees left the event, the
smell of ﬁeshly baked treats replaced that
of soup, as volunteers tempted people with
a small bake sale to satisfy any hunger that
was unmet by the soup and rolls.

Lighten up, West Virginia, have a laugh

Those crazy insult-hounds at.

Abercrombie & Fitch are in trouble
again. This time, it’s not over their
nearly pornographic catalogs and
advertising, allegedly racist hiring
practices or indubitably racist T-
shirts poking fun at Asian laundries.

This time, they pointed their-

rapier wit at West Virginia.

The retailer, which targets teens
and young adults with its preppy,
expensive, casual clothes, has a
range of T—shirts with the slogan,
“It’s all relative in West Virginia”
and a picture of the shape of the
state. West Virginia Governor Bob
Wise has demanded that the shirts
all be destroyed, claiming they per-
petuate an unfair stereotype of the
state. .

Wise, clearly, needs to lighten
up and laugh a little. It’s just a T-
shirt, after all, and not a particularly
clever one at that. The stereotype of
West Virginia as the incest capital of
the world is an old and pervasive
one, and an overpriced T-shirt won’t
make or break it. 6

It’s as if Wise has just had
enough and can’t take one more
West‘ Virginia joke, and so he’s
snapped. And as anyone with a
younger sibling can attest, teasing is
so much more fun when the victim
really gets annoyed. His temper-

tantrum has created much more pub-
licity for the shirts and the company.
Abercrombie should keep the
shirts, Wise should take a deep
breath and accept some free publici-
ty for his state, and West Virginia
should hit back with its own line of
state—insulting T—shirts. After all,
lots of states are ripe for insulting.
What about a T-shirt with a pic-
ture of Florida, bearing the slogan,
“Penis of the Nation”? How about
“Delaware, State of Nothing
Distinguishing but Lack of Sales
Tax”? Our own Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania might look particular-
ly dashing on a shirt that says,»
“Pennsylvania, Not Even Really a
State.” A nice jibe at_ New

Hampshire from the mountains of '

West Virginia could say, “At Least
Our Old Man of the Mountain,
Toothless Drunk He May Be, Can
Keep His Face Attached.”
Wisconsin might have a better sense
of humor about a shirt that says,
“Wisconsin: We Love Cutting. The
Cheese.”

The possibilities are endless.
West Virginia should relax and get
in on the insults. Sure, Abercrombie
& Fitch will never win any sensitiv-
ity awards, but this is one of their
lesser crimes, and hardly worth all
the fuss.

For the eyes of my fellow Druids only

If you’re not a Druid, please stop
reading this. This is top—secret and
for the eyes of Druids only. Dear fel-
low Druids,

I would like to call an emer-
gency meeting for the Delta chapter.
I would have contacted everyone in
a less public way, only Ihad no idea
how else to contact everyone. "I
know that it’s a security risk, bu_t
maybe at the next meeting
we could take off our
hooded robes, quit calling
each other by number, and
introduce ourselves. This
way, not only could we
share contact information
for situationslike this one,
but also, we wouldn’t
seem like a bunch of
dorks.

I am calling an-emer-
gency meeting for several

our club. Even I got the three-quar-
ters vote required in Part 7 of
Section 2 of Article III and I don’t
meet any of the requirementsrlisted
in Section 1 of Article III. Maybe we
should start having a Druid “rush
week” to meet new members, like
the fraternities do. After all, we are
just a crappy, knock-off version of a
frat anyway. The only real difference
is that we’re cooler
because, unlike fraterni-
ties, we’re embarrassed
to let people know who
we are. - 7
Third, I feel the last
few meetings have been
unproductive. There may
be a few reasons for this.
Number Eight has been
too hyper‘ to serve as
"president. This is the

reasons. First of all, I. paid

my $45 initiation fee and

have yet to receive my Druid certifi-
cate. According to Section 1 of
Article IV in our constitution, I am
supposed to receive a certificate. I
understand that someone’s identity
will be revealed to a GDND (God-
Damned Non-Druid) when an order

for a Druid certificate is placed, but I’

I paid my $45 and expect to receive
a certificate. My last A-plus was in
seventh grade, and my mom would
like something new to hang on the
refrigerator.

Secondly, I have a few concerns
about our tapping procedure. We’ve
become so secretive that the only
person who knows the names of new
members to be initiated is the tap
chairman. We don’t know anything
about the prospective members
when we vote on them. This is dan-
gerous, because we really don’t
know whom we arelinitiating into

most elite secret organi-
zation at Pitt, and‘ he
- couldn’t sit still for more
than a minute or two. We will never
accomplish anything unless we
address this problem. ‘Therefore, if
we are to be a productive organiza-
tion, I feel it is essential that we
require all snacks at meetings to be
low in sugar. There should be no
more cookies or orange drink.
Another problem at our meetings
has been all the sexual tension. Two
meetings ago, Number 42 and
Number 56 were wildly groping at
each other for half the meeting. They
didn’t stop until they discovered that
they were both men. (I guess that’s

the risk you take when you start,

groping someone in a robe that con-
ceals his or her identity.) That inci-
dent, of course, distracted all of us,
and I missed the whole thing about
our next Hillman Library march. '

How can checking a box reveal anything of culture?

Check one: #African—American, Caucasian,
Asian, Latin American, Other.

Lately, I’ve been reconsidering
my ideas about questions like this. It
seems to be human nature to need to
classify things; whether we’re clas-
sifying birds, movies, or ourselves,
that desire is always there. Yet
humanity seems to defy classifica-
tion.

Racial classification is especial-
ly problematic. Here, in the United
States, almost 50 years-after the
civil rights movement, we still sub-
scribe to the same “one drop” rule
that was a tool of oppression for so
long — the “one drop” rule stating that if you
have one minority ancestor, you can be officially
classified as a minority.

This is where racial classification begins to
defy logic. Most people just don’t fall so easily
into categories of (quite literally) black and
white. »

‘ My own ancestors were from half a dozen
separate countries. Yet I get to check only one
box. And this box is supposed to sum up who I
am, howl was raised, what kindof schooling I
received, ‘and the amount of opportunity 'I’ve
been given?_ gr ’ V ' ‘ . 5], ,v I

The more anthropology classes I take, the
more I begin to question the whole notion of race
in America.

Contrary to what these check-boxes would

 

Ginger McCall

‘Columnist

have us believe, the differences between groups
of people are not based on skin shade,
but rather on culture.

Culture encompasses a much
broader spectrum of ideas than ‘race’
ever will. Culture is where you grew up,
what kind of music you listen to, your
family’s income, what traditions you
were raised with and what school you
attended. Culture, as a_ term, is the sum
of the circumstances around you.

Unfortunately, many people
attribute these personal details to race.

Prejudice feeds on the" idea of
race, on the idea that someone can be
'/ classified by a check—box so easily, and
that underneath that check—box is a list of traits
that fit that particular color of a person. ,

.Because this person has light/dark skin, he
must have been raised in'this environment with
this set of circumstances. Racial tensions stem
from this misguided type of classification.

A truly open-minded person would recognize’
that the lines are blurred. It is not so easy to sep-
arate people into groups. Simply because two
people have the same skin color doesn’t_ mean

. that they have anything else in common.

The flawed idea of race affects other systems,
as well’..Affirmative action and other attempts to
diversify depend on color and not culture to cre-
ate diversity. Affirmative action takes for granted
that a white student cannot come from an under-
privileged background, just ‘as a black or Latino

Things are falling apart —— we

person cannot come from a privileged back-
ground. It is,‘ in that way, a very prejudiced sys-
tem. ‘ V.

Clubs form on the assumption that all people
of a certain color will have some similar inter-
ests, goals, backgrounds, and ideas, when this is
not true.

True diversity is not so much a survey of how _

many different shades of skin are present,‘ but
rather, how many different backgrounds and
ideas are represented. e .

When we seek so diligently to classify our-
selves, we perpetuate at system of separatism, a
system that divides people based on assumed dif-
ferences instead of actual similarities. The longer
we continue to classify ourselves by one word,
the longer division will exist among us.

This is not to say that no one should be proud
of his or her heritage, but, please, identify her-
itage as what it is: the culture you were brought
up in, not the color of your skin. Skin color is
only one part of the equation and is not an accu-
rate indication of deeper aspects of personality
and background.

The truth is, there is only one race: the human
race. And we are all a part of it. Diversity is
based on different systems of-belief, traditions,
religion, and economic status, not on color.

man-made distinctions, such as Caucasian or
Liberal. She can be reached for comment at

Last week may have been even
worse. Despite ordering an extra-
large robe, I received a small. (So
far, I’m very disappointed with the
$45 I’ve spent on the Druids.) I did-
n’t mind the small size until the mid-
dle of meeting when I popped a
boner. My chubby was very notice-
able and inches from being Tommy
Lee—sized, so it was sort of embar-
rassing.

Finally, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, we need to discuss recertify-
ing our organization. We have not
been certified for about 10 years. It
would be a real shame if we didn’t
act on this and someone. else did.
Any group of 10 students with a fac-
ulty adviser can go to the Student

Organization Resource Center and
recertify the Druids. ,That’s right:
any undergraduate Pitt student can
go recertify the Druids right now.
Gee whiz, it’s a good thing I had all
non-Druids stop reading this.
Otherwise someone reading this
might gather a few friends and a fac-
ulty adviser and make him or herself

president of the Druids. That would _

make all of us look pretty stupid.

Anyway, I think we need to have
an emergency meeting to discuss
these things. Let’s meet at midnight
tonight on the 35th floor of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Christian is ashamed to admit that

he was one of the Druids involved in
the groping. E-mail your thoughts to

Remake of classic undeniably Coen

Coen Brothers’ latest
proves that resistance

is indeed futile  

The Ladykillers

Starring Tom Hanks, Irma P.
Hall, Marlon Wayans, J.K.
Simmons, Ryan Hurst
Directed by Joel and Ethan
Coen

5,2.-a»a

Movie fans foregoing a Coen
Brothers film is like a mosquito
passing up a tube sock full of blood.
Their films, which include the
Oscar winning “Fargo” and 2000’s
“O Brother, Where Art Thou?” are
irresistible, each containing a new
set of insane characters and odd sit-
uations. The appeal also lies in the
pair’si ability to take excessive
swearing and graphic violence to
the level of high art.

This year, the brothers have
chosen to re-make the classic 1955
comedy “The Ladykillers,” a
British film about a team of crooks
who plan a heist from the home of
their innocent old landlady.

_Although remakes are usually a

touchy area in the film indus-
try, the Coensseem more than
up to the challenge of making
the comedy their own.

-“The Ladyki1lers” begins
in Mississippi, where Marva
Munson (Irma P. Hall), a no-
nonsense, church-going
widow, has taken in a groupof
traveling musicians, led by the
long-winded Professor G. H.
Dorr (Tom Hanks).
Unbeknownst to Marva, the so-
called musicians practicing in
her root cellar are actually a
group of amateur criminals out’
to rob the underground
accounting offices of a nearby
river casino. The group, how-
ever, gets more than they bar-
gain for when Munson finds
them out, giving them an ulti-
matum that they return the
money and go to church with
her or deal with the police.
Unwilling to compromise, the
professor decides that she must
be done in, even if it means losing
the lives of a. couple co-conspirators
in the process. '

The story is founded on a sim-
ple premise that mostly relies on the
charm and hilarity of its characters
to keep the film interesting. Hall
was born to play the good-hearted
but tenacious Munson, constantly

preaching to her tenants and local
sheriff about the evils of “hippity-

hop” music. Tom Hanks returns to

his comedy roots as the supposed

Ph.D. Professor Dorr. Although he

seems uncomfortable in the role at

first, Hanks eventually settles into

his wordy, pretentious lecturing, at

points sounding like a human the-
saurus as he tries to rally his
incompetent group of hood-
lums.

The criminals he hires —
through an advertisement,
funnily enough — are a
parade of oddly named,
kooky ne’er-do-wells.
Marlon Wayans plays
Gawain, the quintessential
gun—toting, bling-bling-"w\ear—
ing thug who serves as\the
“inside man.”v Garth Pancake
(J. K. Simmons) is -the explo-
sives expert who, despite the

1 fact that he has irritable
bowel syndrome, can’t.help
but wear khaki short shorts.
The Colonel (Tzi Ma) is a
silent but deadly chain smok-
er who can somehow silence
a room by uttering a single
sentence. Lastly, there’s the

“muscle” of the group, a
hulking, football—playing,
Lennie Small-like idiot
named Lump Hanson (Ryan
Hurst) who timidly refers to

 

Dorras “Coach.” .
Even though the comedy in
“The Ladykillers” is mostly of the

physical, slapstick variety, the
Coens still manage to weave in
some of their deliciously twisted
sense of humor and colorful dia-
logue. Wayans, for example, pro-
vides much of the swearing familiar
to the brothers’ earlier films, unfor-
tunately looking a lot like his char-
acter in the 1996. black ‘drama paro-
dy “Don’t Be a Menace to South
Central While Drinking Your Juice
in the Hood.”'The film also features
a fair amount of violencevand dis-
memberment. At one point, after
losing his finger to a botched explo-
sion, Pancake watches as Munson’s
cat runs off with his bloody, severed
digit. The ending is equally morbid,

_,serving as a sort of sick choreogra-

phy of stranglings, shootings and
head trauma.

Other elements of the film,
including the soundtrack of gospel
music, produced by T-Bone Burnett,
and the flawless cinematography of
Roger Deakins, add to the already
high production values. Overall,
“The Ladykillers” should be a wor-
thy addition to the long list of work
by the Coens.

V “The Ladykillers” opens in theaters

Bottomfeeder perfect
for nu-metal fans

In the Name of Love &
Science
Bottomfeeder .
lnnervenus
1/2
Recommended if you like:
Godsmack, nu-metal

Let it be known that I chose to
review this CD partly because
“Bottom Feeder,” is my one of my
favorite Cave In songs. Factor No; 2

for reviewing this was that they are
local, and I love new, local talent.

Factor No. 3 was that I was told,

they were metal.

I looked at the information
about the band, and saw that there
were upright basses, sitars, elec-
tronic drums and a theremin. I then
read further on, learning that it was
industrial, with influences includ-
ing Black Sabbath and Ministry.
Bear in mind that those artists
aren’t exactly high on my list of
favorites. But as open—minded as I
am, I figured I’d give it a whirl, at
least for kicks.

What I got was a band that

sounded rather mediocre, but what I
really didn’t enjoy was the lead
singer. Without his crooning all
over the tracks, I could honestly say
that the music was not bad at all.
Unfortunately, the band made the
same mistake that certain main-
stream nu-metal bands such as
Disturbed and Godsmack make,
which is that they try to experiment.

Man, I really love experimental
music; I really do. I even hope
bands will try out new things and
explore new sounds in order to get
some really sweet—sounding stuff.
But, unfortunately, this reminded
me far too much of Godsmack’s

.Wiccan inﬂuences, which sounded

horrible on their already poor
records. I think I could have had an
easier time dealing withthe band
had I not read any hype about them.

This is not a “bad” record by
any means, but it’s definitely not
something I could ever see myself
listening to. Again, the most annoy-
ing portion of the display of music
is the vocals. They just sounded too
much like the tortured nu-metal
stuff you’ll hear in bands like

COURTESY 31 STPUB. COM

Bottomfeeder rocks out during a performance at the 31st Pub on the South Side.

Disturbed, Godsmack and Trapt.

If there’s one thing I .don’t like
to do, it’s trash a band. It’s not a
pretty or fun thing to do, especially
knowing that, with their huge studio
lineup, they probably worked
extremely hard on the album. If~I

could give stars for effort, they’d’

probably get three stars out of four,
hands down. Unfortunately, I cri-
tique music, and there is scarcely
anything here for me.to really say
stands out as “good.” i _

If I had to pick out one song that

was tolerable, it’s “Elvilution.” It’s
very: poppy, which makes no sense
on this record", but it works for the

"band. It’s either that, or I just liked

it because I was tired and clawing
for something of a different variety.
If you like nu-metal, which is
totally fine, this album is for you.
But I don’t think I would pass this
on to the “industrial” crowd + even
with my limited industrial music
experience, I don’t think this would

quench any of their needs.

WPT S brings indie favorites Thers to campus

Ah, indie music. The trials and tribulations of
being a lesser—kno,wn rock band, taking a low—bud—
get tour on the road in a minivan or Winnebago ——
depending on just how low—budget the tour is ——
and still rocking the pants off the few tens of peo-
ple that come out to that random venue to see you
play.

A few giants among the indie—rock scene make
their way to Pittsburgh tonight for a very special
show sponsored by “the University of Pittsburgh’s
No. 1 radio station,” 92.1 FM WPTS.

The Wrens, a four—man assault on the music
world, have been at it for well over a decade, hav-
ing started right around the close of the ‘80s. An
airy guitar sound that goes from soothing to rock-
ing is a nice touch to their poignant lyrics and sleek
style. Their latest album, The Meadowlands,
released on Absolutely Kosher Records, has
received rave reviews from music publications
such as “Pitchfork’,’ and “Stylus Magazine.”

Because The Wrens have been around for so
long, they have found their way around the music
industry, making their own atlas of sorts/along the
way. Going through several different record labels
in hopes of producing a solid record and receiving
the support to promote such a record seemed a
never—ending search for The Wrens.

They have done work with the Saddle Creek
label, which released a single for the band, and
Grass Records, which released their album
Secaucus in 1996. Grass Records later changed its
name to Wind Up Records and unleashed the band
Creed on the music world — whe_ther that is a good
thing or a bad thing is still to be determined.

The Wrens later found their way to Drive Thru

Records and MCA, and have had their
music played on various MTV programs,
a large feat for a band that is on an inde-
pendent label and doesn’t even have a
video on the station.

Playing with The Wrens are local anti-
heroes The Karl Hendricks Trio. The
three—man bandifrom Pittsburgh also_has
received rave reviews for their history of
works, including their most recent
release, The Jerks Win Again.

Released in the summer of 2003,
Jerks is filled with distortion and a pow-
erful, offbeat rhythm section, making for
some interesting music. They bring
humor into their music with titles like
“The Overweight Lovers” and “The
Summer of Warm Beer,” but with

thoughtful lyrics and incredible musician—-

ship, The Karl Hendricks Trio is a great
band hidden under the radar in our local
music scene.

This show is the first of two that’ -
WPTS has planned for this week. Read I .

tomorrow’s section for a preview of the

other great show that features Mates of

State, Palomar, The Oranges Band and
Missing Pilots. . ‘

Louque gets misrepresented his label,
makes listening to latest album a bit of a chore

So Long
Louque

Recommended if you like:
Mediocre reggae '

It’s so hard to be a musician in
2004. Every band claims to sound like
everyone else, and inﬂuences mean
jack on press releases. Half the time,
bands never sound like who they say

they do. I was skeptical about this

Massive Attack‘,and',iColdplay, I would
dig Louque. If I liked old-school reg-

.gae and dub, and if_I loved ambient

music, I would dig Louque. If I hated
what was on the radio, I woulddig

A Louque. I

,these' brave and abstract compar-

isons-?, 

 ‘rm sure some of you are asking,

“Is it Loake/Lo-coo/Lo-qwee  ahh,
forget it; how do you say it?” It’s pro-
nou‘-ncedlike the” name “Luke.” Now,
this seems pretentious on its own. But
I was supposed to expect “hypnotic,

_ homemade beats and mysterious
Cajun inﬂuences,” creating an “ambi-

ent masterpiece.” I don’t know if it
‘lives up to allthat hype, but the com-
parisons to Coldplay and Massive
Attack seem pretty far off—base. i

The band does not have the slick
beat production of .Massive Attack,
nor any of the vocal or melody
stylings ‘of Coldplay. If I were told
that this was a straight-up reggae/dub

record, I would have given this a bet— .

ter score. But I don’t like being mis-

- led, much like many of you out there.

The closestiLouque gets to Massive
Attack’ or Coldplay is in “Still in
Waiting,” but only because it’s main-

" ly piano, bass and drums.- It still does

not compare to either of the two
artists in any other way, which is
rather unfortunate.

This record -wouldn’t\fall under
any real ambient category, either.
Does anyone even know what ambi-
ent means anymore? Ambient is usu-
ally minimalist, and there’s definitely
way too much going on in this album
to even'classify it a_s minimalist or

ambient. Why do record companies
try to pigeonhole their artists into cat-
egories they clearly don’t belong in?

Ranting about genres aside, the
music itself is. pretty decent, and the
vocals are nice, even if. they get
annoying at times. The production is
also very nice on this record, thus giv-
ing it a bit more in the quality points
category. .

If you like reggae, you will prob-
ably enjoy this album. It’s not cutting-
edge and it won’t blow your mind, but
it’s decent as’ far as that genre goes. If

-you’re expecting some great triphop,

.heads out there. But I strongly

a la Massive Attack, or Britpop, a la
Coldplay, you’re not going to find it
here. But if you’re looking for an
above-average reggae record, this will
probably be right up your alley.

I Louque’s probably not going to
turn any heads, but it should make for.

On a casual Roam through the ‘Burgh, we came across a cat show...

Brushes, combs, shampoos and even clothing were for sale.
Not to leave out the humans, there were also T-shirts,
sweaters, pins and tables of cat—relate_d

“Now, this young lady has a beautiful face — round,
perfectly shaped. Her legs are a good length and evenly
spaced. She has a wonderful shoulder span and an
excellent, strong body. Truly a very beautiful gir .”

This past weekend, I attended a beauty pageant of
sorts.

The competition didn’t feature a talent or swim-
suit contest, but it did include more than 400 entrants. —
On Saturday and Sunday, Heinz Field hosted the
Western Pennsylvania Cat Fanciers cat show and
welcomed a different type of feline from
the normal Panther Football variety.
Being a cat lover myself, this was not
something I could easily pass up.

As I stepped out of the elevator on the
second level of Heinz Field I was
greeted by the smell of fur, sham-
poo and catnip — an interesting
and not altogether uninviting com-
bination. I passed vendors selling row
upon row of feline-related, merchandise.
“These shows have become so commer-
cial,” I thought to myself. “In my day, I
remember...” I

Actually, ﬂris was my first cat show, and I
was way too busy watching afeather on a string as it ,
whined on its mechanized rotor to do much thinking. A V
woman with a ﬂuﬂ’y, almost pure-white longhair joined me I

at the stand, and her pet batted at the feather.

Besides this simple yet mesmerizing toy, the show

offered everything from luxury pet beds to designer collars.

Pittsburgh. Each cat had its own station and, as I walked ’

among them, dodging the cats’ handlers as they bustled
about to get their felines perfect for the judges, I saw every
breed, color and shape. Most, being old pros at this type of
attention, simply followed the passing onlookers with their
eyes and gave an occasional ﬂip of ﬂue taﬂ — all except for
the Manx. _ ' .
Many of the breeders also had signs armouncing kittens

for adoption. These advertisements were posted just above -

the tiny faces of the furry creatures, which looked up with
plaintive eyes and emitted small meows. I had to move
quickly from these stands for fear that I might adopt one, all
while knowing that University housing doesn’t smﬂe
- kindly upon pets.
Off to one side, the real show was going
on, as judges examined the diiferent cats according

A new face was standing on the
other side of the microphone to ask
Carl Krauser a question.

“Hey, Carl, what do you think
we’ve got to do to win this big game
we’ve got?” Pitt forward Chris Taft
asked, with a carefree smile on his
face.

“We’ve got to give the ball down
to Chris Taft and Chevy Troutman
and those guys downthere,” Krauser
responded, grinning from ear to ear.
“We’ve got to play our Pitt style of
basketball.” ’

Loose, jovial and full of confi-
dence. That’s how the Pitt basketball
team was acting as it got ready to get
on the bus to head for East
Rutherford, N.J., for its Sweet 16
game against Oklahoma State tonight
at 7:27 pm. The game will be aired
on CBS and broadcast locally on
WPTS. ‘

The Panthers have advanced this
far for the third consecutive year, and
although the firsttwo trips ended in
defeat, each season was considered a
success. But this year, just being
there isn't good enough.

“This is not really an accom-
plishment to us, and I think that’s a
good thing,” Julius Page said. “Last
two years, we came up short, and
obviously, to say that we’ve
improved, we have to make it past
this game.” 7

Pitt ready to face

Unlike the past two seasons, No.
3 Pitt enters this game as the lower
seed and is facing possibly the
toughest team it has seen in the
NCAA Tournament in the last three
years.

Oklahoma State (29-3) earned a
No. 2 seed after winning the Big 12
regular season title and tournament
championship, and the Cowboys’
game is similar to the Panthers.

“Pretty consistent, pretty similar
and very well—coached and very good

defensively,” Pitt head coach Jamie

Dixon said when asked to describe
Oklahoma State. “It’s a very experi-
enced team — a lot of seniors, a lot
of transfers.”

One of those transfers is point
guard John Lucas, ' who came to
Oklahoma State from Baylor last off-
season. Lucas leads the Cowboys
offense, averaging 4.6 assists per
game to go along with 15.3 points,
and "will be a tough matchup for
whichever Panther gets to guard him.

“It’ll be a game-time decision,”
Page said about who will guard
Lucas. “He’s real quick; he can shoot
the ball; he backs down from no one,
no matter how big the other opponent
is.’’ .

Also in the backcourt is Tony
Allen, the Cowboys’ leading scorer,
with 16 points per contest. Allen and

Lucas were named the Big 12’s co- ‘

Players of the Year, the first time two
players from the same team have
won the award.

J aron Brown congratulates Chevon Troutman after 'll‘outman was fouled after
scoring a basket during Pitt’s Win over Wisconsin.

“They shoot the ball pretty well,”
Dixon said. “They’re a very good
jump-shooting team from mid-
range and also from three, as well.

' Their bigs can step out and shoot the

ball very well.”

Down low, Oklahoma State relies
on forwards Ivan McFarlin and Joey
Graham. McFarlin leads the team in
scoring and rebounding in the tour-
nament, with 16.5 points and 10

boards in two games, while Graham j

is scoring 12.5 points and grabbing
three rebounds.
What the Cowboys lack is size,

‘with no one taller than 6 feet 8 inch-

es tall, but Taft doesn’t think that’s
much. of an advantage for Pitt.

“They can jump real high, and
they play bigger than that,” he said.
“Their height doesn’t mean anything.
It matters how much heart you’ve
got, and you can tell they’ve got a lot
of heart.”

One aspect Pitt will have to
improve on is its shooting. The

Panthers have shot worse than 40
percent in their two tournament
games, and, against a team - that
shoots better than 50 percent a game,
Pitt’s offense is going to have to heat
.uP- ‘

“We have to be [due for a great
shooting game],” Krauser said. “It’s
fate; it’s destiny, and that’s what
We’re going to do. We’re going to
shoot the ball well, We’re going to
rebound well; We’re just going to
play great basketball.”

While Pitt’s inside game has
been-successful, its outside shooting
has been off. Krauser, Page and J aron
Brown have combined to shoot 28
percent over the past three games.

“We’ve just got to come out and
execute and we’ve got to take care of
our business on offense,” Page said.
“As long as we keep winning, We’re
going to keep playing basketball, and
I love to play basketball. I’m going
to do whatever I can in my power for
us to win.”

Pitt takes season series

from Youngstown State

, BRIAN GOLDMAN »
Staff Writer

The fierce competition at the
Pitt women’s tennis meet could be
heard ' throughout the Oxford
Athletic Center in Monroeville, Pa.,
Wednesday, as Pitt swept the season
series with Youngstown State, 5-2,
to improve to 8-2 overall on the
season. , _

Earlier in the season, the tennis
team defeated Youngstown State, 4-
3, in Youngstown, Ohio. One of
those three losses came in Hayley
Hughes’ match. Yesterday, she
avenged her loss from earlier in the
year with a straight-set win, 7-5 and
6-3. ' 4

“I hadn’t played this well since
before spring break,” Hughes said.

“I was putting the ball away more,

closing out points and making less
unforced errors.” _ _

The meet didn’t start the way
the Panthers had hoped. Pitt lost; the
one team point given to the winner
of the -three doubles matches.
Emmers and Danielle Shuttleworth
had the lone victory in doubles
action with an 8-4 win. _

In non-conference matches, the
players on the court are alsothe
line judges. Official line judges are
only called in for Big East competi-
tion. Becky Emmers’ match against
Heather Hagood grew so intense on
court two that some questionable
calls forced both teams’ ‘coaches _to

bring players from the bench to’

Come judge the match.

Emmers, who won the first set
7-5, found herself 5-2' in the sec-
ond set. Hagood took the next four

games.to take a 6-5,lead in the set,
before Emmers sent the set into a
tiebreak, which Emmers won, 11-9,
to prevail in the match.

A couple of times during the
tiebreak, both Emmers and Hagood
seemed to get rattled on the court
bylclose line calls. In the end
though, Emmers believes she kept
her cool better then her opponent

and that her composure won her the '

match. . «
“[Hagood] got too involved in

v the calls,” Emmers said. “I won the

mental game. Line calls are a part

_ of college tennis.”

A. Pitt victory ‘came on court
three, where Anne Davieslwon in
straight sets 6-4 and 6-3. After los-
ing in‘ her doubles match, Davies
was determined to win her singles

_ match.

“I was just trying to be consis-
tent,” Davies said. “My opponent
wasn’t fast, so I tried to move the

ball around the court.”

In the best match of the day,
Emily Hughes won ‘in three sets, 6-
7 (5-7). 7-6 (7-5) and 7-6 (7-4).
After losing the first set, Hughes
picked up her game and eked out
the victory that put Pitt over the top
in the meet. V

Also‘ victorious for the Panthers
yesterday was Konita Jude. She

"won, 6-2 and 6-3. Her match was

completed in less‘ than an hour.

Pitt makes two great comebacks  

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team has been
making a name for its self by mak-
ing comebacks in games that appear
out of reach. .

But when the Panthers had a
lead in their second game of a dou-
bleheader against Niagara, they
found themselves on the opposite
end of the comeback trail.

Pitt 15, Ohio 11

After sophomore outfielder Ben
Copeland upped his hit streak to 13
games in the top of the first inning,
he was then able to score on a sac-
rifice ﬂy by Jim Negrych.

Pitt’s lead was short—lived, how-
ever, as the Bobcats rallied and

i scored four runs in the bottom of
the first inning.‘By the endof the’

fifth inning, Ohio led 11-7, and it
appeared as though hope was fading
for the Panthers.

Pitt found a way to score runs in
a hurry, putting up three in the sixth
inning before tying the game at 11

l in the eighth inning.

Both offenses, were quietafter
that, until the top of the 11th
inning, when Mike Scanzano hit a
two-run single to help push the
Panthers past the Bobcats. '

Pitt 9, Niagara 8

Through the first three innings‘
-of play in Pitt’s home opener at

Trees Field, the Panthers were
shocked as :Niagara’es .offense
exploded and put up eight runs: 4

But this Pitt team seems to have
a knack for making comebacks.

The" Panthers chipped away at
Niagara’s lead — two runs in the
bottom of the third, three more in
the bottom of the fourth. Then, in
the bottom of the fifthinning, the
Panthers put up another three runs
to grab the lead, 9-8.

Copeland went three—for-four

with four RBIs and even scored
four runs, extending his hit streak
to 14 in the process. Head coach Joe
Jordano is very excited about the

way the young outfielder has been

performing lately.

“Ben has been playing outstand-
ing baseball,” Jordano said. “He’s a
catalyst for our team and a great
leadoff hitter. With him being only
a, sophomore, we’re thrilled to have
him.” ,

Jordano was obviously happy to
get the win, but is concerned about
the way his team has been continu—
ously getting itself into precarious
situations

“Overall, we’re not playing the

type of baseball that I expect us to
play,” Jordano said. “We’re young
in some areas, but we have some
veterans, as well. And I just think
that we need to pick up our game
and play it the way the way we
coach it.” '

“That was a great comeback,”
Jordano continued. “We did the
same thing [against Ohio] when we
down 5-1 and came back in that
game. But I focus on how we’re
playing the game, because I know
that that will translate "into success
no matter who we’re playing. So
I’m a little disappointed today.”

Niagara 4, Pitt 3

In the second game of Pitt’s
doubleheader, they found them-
selves in an unfamiliar situation —
leading early in the contest.

P.J.’ Hiser hit a two-run home

run in the bottom of the third to.

help the Panthers jump out to a 3-0
lead. The home run brought Hiser’s
season total to seven.

It looked like Pitt was going to P

hang on and sweep the Purple
Eagles, but things unraveled in the
sixth inning. ' “

With the bases, loaded and two
outs, Niagara’s
stepped to the plate and hit a two-
run single to give his team its first
lead of the game. ,

With‘ the tying run in scoring

position,‘ Tom Cashman and Hiser

struck out in order,'ending the

Panthers’ chance of a comeback.
After the game, Jordano was

visibly disappointed in his ,team’s

- performance.

j“I think our pitching is poor right‘

now, ‘ with some exceptions,”
Jordano said. -_“I think our offense
needs to be more disciplined at the
plate. We are fielding well, and we
are running the bases well. But We
need all four of those areas to be on
point in order to be successful.”

Jordano feels that ‘his team is
talented enough to be successful in
the Big East Conference, but just
need to focus and not make the lit-
tle mistakes that are oftentimes the
difference between winning and
losing. . .

“We’ve got great kids on our
team, and I know that they try hard
and work hard,” Jordano said. “But
it’s the team that plays hard, focus-
es hard, and executes that is going
to be successful.”

The Panthers head down to
Blacksburg, Va.'this weekend where

_ they will play a three-game series

against Virginia Tech.

“We’re going to have a very
focused practice tomorrow,”
Jordano said. “We’ll get after it,
and we’ll be prepared.” '

Players’ union needs to agree on tougher drug testing in major league baseball

SPO. VIEW

     

So, the Major League Baseball Players
Association has ﬁnally come out and said that they
would agree to “more stringent steroid testing.”

Three words: It’s about time!

Baseball operates under the loosest, most lenient
set of steroid regulations in all of professional sports.
And they have recently been taking some pretty seri-
ous heat because of it. Donald Fehr, head of the
MLBPA, said that he would notbe surprised if the
steroid policy was changed before the end of the labor
agreement in December of 2006.

“You have to be willing to look at things again as
current situations change,” Fehr said. “I’m not sur-
prised about anything one way or another.”

Aside from the light penalties, many are upset
because players are tested just twice, in a one-week
span, each year. Earlier this month, many congress-
men criticized Fehr and the MLBPA for not doin
enough to get steroids out of baseball. V

Regardless of your political affiliation, or what
you may think of Sen. John McCain, R—Ariz., give him
some credit for stepping up and saying something
about the problem.

“The status quo is not acceptable,” McCain told
Fehr. “And we will have to act in some way unless the
major league players’ union acts in the affirmative and
rapid fashion.” .

And McCain wasn’t the only one in Congress
making his voice heard. .

“I don’t think that the players’ union has gotten the
message, but they’re getting it,” Rep. Jim
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said last week. “If somebody
keels over’ dead because of an overdose, it doesn’t do
the players any good, because dead players don’t pay
union dues.”

Fehr was not alone in receiving criticism due to
lack of action taken. Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., feels it is
time for commissioner Bud Selig to stop playing soft-
ball with the players’ union.

“He can’t just tiptoe around the tulips like he’s
done for so many years as commissioner,” Miller said.

All of these congressmen make great points, but
we certainly do not want to see government interfer-
ence in professional sports.

This is supposed to be’ our game, and we should do
anything and everything to protect it and keep it from
being compromised. Do we really want to see an aster-
isk in the record book next to the home run records?

While it may be a little too late for that, it isn’t too
late to put a stop to the steroid problem and bring some
respectability back to the game. '

Of course, if you listen to what most current play-
ers say, there is no steroid problem. But if you take the
word of former MVPs Jose Canseco and Ken
Carniniti, steroid use is rampant in baseball.

For obvious reasons, Canseco is not the most reli-
able source. But he is not alone in speaking out on
baseba1l’s steroid problem. Let’s not forget Turk
Wendell’s_war of words with Barry Bonds, or Bonds’
trainer being indicted by a federal grand jury, even
though both Bonds and his trainer have both vehe-
mently proclaimed their innocence.

The only good news in the situation is that Fehr
has yet to ask players to stay silent on the steroid issue.

“We don’t have any gag orders,” Fehr said. “We
believe in free speech.”

Most baseball fans also believe in free speech, and
its time thatpeople start speaking out, in order to pre-
serve the game. '

Professional baseball just keeps sliding farther and
farther down the tubes. If something isn’t done soon,
all respectability in the game will be lost. We’re talk-
ing about America’s pastime here, aren’t»we?

lead.

After UConn scored two goals
to reclaim the lead, Robbins knotted
the score at four before heading into
the half.

Robbins finished with three
goals and recorded an assist.

The division-leading Panthers
will compete at home against No. 5
Michigan for the outright division
lead on Saturday at 3 p.m. A win
could place Pitt in the top 10 in the
nation, according to Heaps.

“We’d love to have the support
of Pitt students this Saturday,”
Heaps said.

— Jimmy Johnson, staff writer

Pitt’s equestrian team contended
with snow, sleet, wind and mud at
its show over the weekend, but the
team didn’t let the conditions pre-
vent them from having a strong per-
formance at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania.

“The weather was pretty bad and
made things difficult,” team mem-
ber Margaret Mahoney said.

The team’s strongest event was

in novice ﬂat, where it had the first-
and second-place finishes from
Sidney Rozek and Mahoney, respec-
tively.

Mahoney had a tough draw
when she was given a horse that
would not cooperate. Luckily,’ the
judges noticed how stubborn‘ the
horse was being and gave her a re-
ride. -

“They pulled the horse because
it was being difficult,” Mahoney
said.

Pitt also had a strong perfor-
mance in advanced walk, trot, and
canter by Marisa LaQuatra, as she
was able to bring home a blue rib-
bon.

Another Pitt notable during the
show was Courtney Burford, who
finished second in open ﬂat.

Jocelyn Kozick also had a good
day, finishing second in intermedi-
ate fences.

And in novice fences, Kira
Mamula was Pitt’s top performer,
earning second place.

Pitt’s next show is the regional
competition, which is scheduled to
take place March 28 in Canonsburg,
Pa.
