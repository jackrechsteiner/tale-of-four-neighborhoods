Pitt News poll shows Gore in lead

 

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN

News Editor

It’s all been building to this. The rallies, the
bumperstickers, the posters, the celebrities, the
comedians and the phone calls have all been build-
ing to today.

Today is Election Day, a day
when special interests have reason to
“tremble,” according to Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential candidate. It is a day that
will bring “new leadership to
Washington, D.C.,” according to his
Republican opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush.

College Republicans and University Democrats,
alongside Pitt Libertarians,
Campus Greens and the
International Socialist
Organization have collec-
tively spent hundreds of

News
 hours campaigning for their
parties’ candidates.

By rallying, phone-banking and standing -on

  
   
  

street comers with signs, each party has worked in
the hopes of electing its representative.
And each party is counting on being victorious.
“I think in the end, George Bush will be victori-
ous,” said Nick Havens, president of the College
Republicans.
Stephanie Strazisar, president of the University
Democrats, predicted victory for Al Gore.
' “If people remember to
vote,” she said, “we’ll deﬁnitely
be able to win.”
. Tomorrow's weather may
have a big impact on a race that is
already being touted as one of the tight-
est in years.

The National Weather Service
reports that today will be “mostly cloudy,
with scattered rain showers.” The bureau predicts a
50 percent chance of rain throughout the day.

Havens hopes the service is right.

“It [the rain] helped us last November,” he said.

With 500,000 more registered Democrats than
Republicans in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
Republicans hope that some nasty weather might
keep Democrats indoors, instead of at the polls.

Strazisar conceded that rain might not help the

The College Republicans and the
University Democrats spent the ﬁnal

‘hours before Election Day canvassing

the area in a last—ditch effort to rally
support for their parties.

Last night the College Republicans
traveled to the airport to rally for
Pennsylvania’s Republican candidates.
The events started at 6 p.m. and includ-

. ed Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., Barbara
Hafer and Mike Fisher. Santorum is‘

running for re—election to the U.S. sen-

ate, Hafer is rlmning for treasurer, and A

Fisher is running for attorney general.

A large group of enthusiastic sup-
porters gathered at the airport to hear
the candidates speak about the impor-
tance of Allegheny ‘
County in the state
elections. All
speakers told the
crowd to call on
their friends and
family to get out the
Republican vote on Nov.
7.

College Republican President Nick

- Havens said he was conﬁdent that the

group did a great job of spreading

George W. B_ush’s message.
Meanwhile, the University

Democrats had their visibility rally at 5

’ p.m. on various. spots outside the

William Pitt Union. Starting at the
Union, supporters marched to the cor-
ner of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow

A held up signs that read
“Vote Pro—Choice, Vote

 _. with small American ﬂags. The
 supporters were received by the
public with cheers, jeers and
honks from oncoming motorists.

When asked about the importance '

of the visibility rally, Brendan Harris,
president of the University Democrats,

said the main purpose was to remind

people to get out and vote, and that they
should vote for Gore. He said he was
very happy with the overall campaign

Libertarian candidate speaks in the Union

LESLIE ‘HOFFMAN

, didate

V means of protest.

- Senior Staff Writer

Dr. Julian Heicklen has smoked a
marijuana cigarette in front of Penn State
University’s main gates every Thursday
at noon since Jan. 15, 1998.

Heicklen, the Libertarian Party can-
for - attorney general of
Pennsylvania explained to a crowd of
about 50 people last night that he began

‘ smoking marijuana in public to ‘protest a .

false arrest and an unfair trial.

He said that he does not advocate the
smoking of marijuana, and that he has
always examined other pathways before

resorting to civil disobedience.

“I never smoke except in public,” he
said. Heicklen also said that he has been
arrested six times for smoking marijuana
and once for using a bullhom.to inform
the public of his use of smoking as a

Heicklen began his“

addressing his ‘audience, “Fellow

Americans, we are in the midst? of the 

greatest calamity since the Civil War.”

He then provided three stories of
individuals whose rights were invaded by
government.

He ﬁrst cited an example of police
invading a Penn State student’s room at 8
am. and asking a student for permission
to_ search the room without a warrant.

Were the student to refuse, police would
force him to remain outside until they
obtain a warrant.

Heicklen wondered why the police
did not obtain a warrant in the first place.

Heicklen said police illegally seized
the student’s property after entering the
room. '

He also cited two
examples of women
who had all of their
children taken from
their custody without
due process of law
because their newborn
children tested positive for
marijuana and barbiturates. In one of
the cases, the mother’s doctor had pre-
scribed the barbiturates for her, causing
the positive drug tests.

Heicklen said that in Pennsylvania,
individuals can_ be held in jail for six
months without a trial. A
 ,, “How would you like to spend six
months in jail and then be found not

which is illegal in Pennsylvania — but
that he does not feel they are crimes.
Heicklen then shared stories of indi-
viduals who were prosecuted for their
medicinal use of marijuana.
“I read their stories. I cried. I want to
tell you their stories,” he said. A
He told a story of one woman who
' was plagued with a dis-
ease known as Wilson’s
disease and could not
talk for several years.
When she began smoking
marijuana for relief, she could
_  speak after only seven days of
f smoking the drug.

“In our society, this woman is a
criminal,” Heicklen said as his face
cringed and his voice wavered.

Heicklen also talked about the trav-
esties of American prisons. He said that
in 1972, America’s prisons contained
200,000 prisoners. Today, the United

' States has over 2 million prisoners, and
the highest prison population in the
world. .

He said that America has 4.6 percent
of the world’s population and 25 percent
of the world’s prisoners. _

“Incidentally, I correspond with
about 200 [Pennsylvanian] inmates,” he
said.

Heicklen also noted that Amnesty
International and the United Nations
Commission on Torture have chastised

 
  
     

 

“‘

The candidate also criticized the lack

trials and the misuse of bails.

“The most fundamental of human .
rights is the right to patrol your own
body,” Heicklen said. '

He said that he does not advocate the
use of illicit drugs, sex outside of mar-
riage, violence and fortune telling —

the United States for inhumane treatment
of prisoners.

“We are engaged in a struggle for the
soul of America,” he said.

Heicklen reiterated his points and
said, “I am angry about these abuses.
That is why I am the Libertarian Party
candidate.”

He then outlined his qualiﬁcations
for the ofﬁce of state attorney general.

Among a string of accomplishments,
Heicklen is professor emeritus of chem-
istry at Penn State and published the text

which was the world standard on atrnos- '

pheric chemistry for 12 years.

He has also been activein Amnesty
International since 1994, and was
involved with 34 trials, 19 of which he
tried himself. He also organized the
Centre County Chapter of the Libertarian
Party in 1997. _

In 1999, he was awarded the
Libertarian Party‘ of Pennsylvania
achievement award.

Heicklen told the audience that he
would need their help to get elected.

“Some of you may wonder if a
Libertarian can be elected,” Heicklen
said.

He remarked that over 40 elected
ofﬁcials in Pennsylvania are libertarians
and that there are over 1,400 libertarians
in elected ofﬁcials across America.

“We’re America’s third-largest

party,” he said.

votes — vital in today’s race. Only
one president ——~ Richard Nixon -

has ever won the election without car-
rying Pennsylvania.

To win the presidency, a candidate
must secure 270 of a possible 538
electoral votes. Pennsylvania has the
fifth largest purse, behind only
California (58), Texas (32), New York
(33) and Florida (25). "

In an informal Pitt News phone
survey, approximately 58 percent of
registered Pitt voters are planning on
voting for Al Gore, and roughly 26
percent say they will cast their vote
for George W. Bush. About 8 percent
plan on voting for Green Ralph Nader,

and nearly 7 percent remain undecid-
ed.

Students who are unregistered
have one last chance to register and
vote. By appearing at the Allegheny
County Courthouse with photo identi-
fication and evidence that they have
lived in the area for at least 30 days,
students can be registered on the spot
and may vote today.

Those who are registered at an
address on campus are eligible to vote
in the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.
Those registered from North Oakland
may vote at the Schoolfor the Blind

Goldblum has campaigned for a
Democratic presidential candidate. . '
“I worked eight years ago for

Clinton against Georgc’s fathe‘r,”.

Goldblum said. “He can’t win, that
George W. Bush, can he?”

Goldblum presented his speech as
an open forum and asked students for
their questions. “This is a town meet-
ing,” Goldblum said. “We need to
work together.”

“If you feel like I do about the
danger of Bush getting in, I beg you
—-- if you’re going to the polls anyway,
vote for Gore,” Goldblum said.

Goldblum also encouraged non-
registered voters to get out to -the polls
tomorrow. Those who are not regis-
tered can still go to their local court
house to register by
providing the cour-
thouse with proof
of residency.

Representatives
from BAS, the
Rainbow Alliance,
CLASA, the University

-- Democrats, National Abortion and,

Reproductive Rights Action League
and State Representative Dan Frankel
were present. However, all student
organizations were invited. 0

The first of the student speakers
was Jay Dworin, political action chair-
person of BAS, who explained that the
next president will be responsible for
appointing the next Supreme ‘Court
justices.

“They will affect your life
whether you’re black, white, Asian,
straight or queer,” Dworin said. “The

appointment isn’t for the next four

years, but for 30 to 40 years.”

Seth Tryninewski, social chair of
the Rainbow Alliance, addressed the
issue of gay rights.

“There are currently 38 states
where you can be fired if you are per-

    
  
   

ceived as being gay,” Tryninewski
said. ‘‘Al Gore_ knows this.”

Tryninewski also mentioned
Gore’s support of the Civil Unions
Law, and gays’ rights to adopt chil
dren. _ _ ’

Michelle Agostini spoke for
CLASA about issues surrounding hate
crimes and affirmative action.

“Hate crimes can’t continue. Hate
crime legislation must be enacted,”
Agostini said.

Este Griffith
University Democrats as she chal-
lcnged Bush’s attention to youth.
Griffith .mentioned Bush’s recent
rejection of an MTV invitation to
speak at a public forum addressing
youth voters.

“Bush doesn’t care about us,”
Griffith said. “He refused to go to a

forum that would address students like

us. ,
Frankel, the only
politician at the forum,
informed V students not to
“waste”, their vote on can-
didate Ralph Nader. He said
that he respects the candidate

supports the same issues.
“This is the most important elec-

tion in our lifetime,” Frankel said. “A'

lot is at stake in this election for you
guys.” 0 T '

_ Frankel explained to students that
voting for Nader today would help
Bush win the election.

» “A vote for Nader will be a vote
for Bush,” Frankel said.

Michelle Wirth from the. National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League closed the event, main-
1y addressing the topic of abortion.

“Two people who should vote pro-
choice tomorrow are women who use
birth control and men who count on
it,” Wirth said.

Wirth said that when voter turnout
is low, a conservative president is gen-
erally elected. She said that high voter

turnout elects a progressive president.

OPINIONS

A EDITORIAL
Even those who aren’t registered

yet have no excuse not to vote

The tension has been intensifying,
particularly over the last week People
are rallying in the streets, holding up
signs signifying the candidate they sup-
port. Conversations all around campus
-— between students, professors, family
members and friends —- have taken a
turn for the political. Celebrities such as
Jeff Goldblum have visited Pittsburgh
to encourage people to vote and push
the parties and candidates they believe
in. Political ﬁgures including
Republican presidential candidate
George Bush, Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore, former First Lady
Barbara Bush and Democratic vice
presidential candidate Joe Lieberman

‘have recently journeyed to Western

Pennsylvania to hold rallies and deliver
speeches.
Today, all the excitement comes to

V a climax. Today is Election Day.

There are no valid reasons why
today should be just another day for
anyone. Even the seemingly infallible»
excuse of not being registered to vote is
no longer applicable. "

A quick trip to the Allegheny
County Courthouse Downtown will
alleviate all your lack-of—registration
woes. All you need is a form of identi-
ﬁcation such as a driver’s license and
proof that you have lived in the area for
at least 30 days. Something as simple as
a phone bill addressed in your name

will sufﬁce.W"1th these items, the folks
at the courthouse can register you on

' the spot.

Time —— or lack thereof —— is not a
valid excuse either. You are assigned a
place of polling based on where you
live; for most students it is a convenient
location such as Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial or Posvar Hall. You’ ve heard
it before, and it’s true — voting only
takes a few minutes.

The forecast for today is rainy but
this too is not an adequate reason to
reﬁain from voting. Wear your rain

slicker or suck it up and get wet. It’s»

well worth it.

If you already voted using an
absentee ballot, congratulations on
being ahead of the game. Celebrate

your decision today and harass all your '

friends to make sure they vote.

Perhaps this is the ﬁrst presidential
election in which you are eligible to
vote. Like your ﬁrst kiss or your ﬁrst
day of school, your ﬁrst presidential

' vote will be memorable. Ask for a

receipt at the polls and preserve it in
your scrapbook or journal. _
U1tirnately,voting today will be

outstanding moment in your lifetime,
regardless of whom you vote for, where
you vote and how many times you’ve
voted in the past. An election this close
is such a rarity. Make a decision and
make a difference.

Vote your conscience today

For most Americans, today will be one of the
most, if not the most, important days of the year.
All across America people will be exercising their
right to vote. Somehow America has persevered
through all of the debates, campaign rallies,
phone calls and negative advertisements in the
media. But before you pull that lever, take a step
back for a moment and think about how this elec-
tion will affect everyone.

Think about how many people before you
touched that lever. Think about who they are,
where they came from and where they are now.

I atn asking you to vote your conscience.

from your privileges, whether they
be of gender, race or socioeconom-
ics that result from your upper— or
rniddle-class background. Before
you vote for anyone, think about how your deci-
sions will affect people different than you.

Take some time to think about how this elec-
tion will affect your fellow students here at Pitt.
Are the candidates who you are casting your vote
for increasing ﬁnancial aid for college students?

Think about students still in middle school
and high school and remember when you were in
their shoes, starting to think about college or a
higher education program. Some of these stu-
dents may not have the ﬁnancial resources to
attend an institution of higher education.

Are the candidates youare voting for sup-
porting ﬁnancial aid and Pell Grant increases,
mentorship programs for middle school students

. and improvement in public schools, without strip-

ping them of their ftmding? Even if you have a
strong ﬁnancial backing to afford college, take a
moment to think about all of those people who do
not before you pull that lever.

Do your candidates care about protecting
clean water and air? What are their priorities with

» the environment? Are they going to support poli-

cytokeepgreenspacesandcurburbansprawl?
Do they support policies to end environmental
problems, racism and socioeconomic bias when
companies want to construct facilities in low-
inoome areas heavily populated by minorities?

gas prices to think about which candidates sup-
port research for alternative resources?

Think about how older Americans will be
affected by the next president and Congress. How
are your candidates’ policies going to ensure that
Social Security will be there when we retire?

Think about how your vote affects the free-
dom for a woman to choose to have an abortion.
If you are a man, step back and consider how
your vote will affect women. Do you have a right
to tell a woman what to do with her body? Would
you want a woman to tell you what to do with
your body? Do your candidates care about insur-
ance coverage for birth control or
are they content with just letting
Viagra be covered?

If you are white, take a
moment to think about how many
times you have been stopped by the police. Did
you know why you were pulled over? Think
about your candidates and their support or lack of
support for legislation against racial proﬁling.

Is affirmative action important to you?'Is it
important to your ﬁiends, family and the students
at Pitt? Do you recognize a need for aﬂirmative
action? Have you ever been in a classroom or a
work environment in which you were the only
person of color or the only woman? Do you know
what it is like to be qualiﬁed for a job, but be dis-
 against because of your background?

Remember the brutal deaths of James Byrd
Jr. and Matthew Shepard when you vote. Is there
a diﬁerence between a crime and a hate crime?
Your vote will decide if Congress and the presi-
dent realize that diﬂerence.

Of all of the campaign rhetoric that I’ve
heard, one statement lingers in my mind. Vote
your conscience. Today I challenge you to step
back ﬁom your safe space and background, from
your privilege of gender, race or ﬁnancial status,
and think about how your vote will make a dif-
ference in other people’s lives.

Stephanie Strazisar hopes you will be able to
wake up on Wednesday and be satisﬁed with who
you voted for this election for the next 40 years of

your life.

When the political becomes personal

I used to laugh at people who took poli-
tics personally. Why worry about something
as far away as the White House, the gover-
nor’s mansion, the town hall? There were
always much more pressing things to take
care of, it seemed Who had time, I won-
dered, to be a political activist and fully
informed citizen when there was homework
to do, jobs to report to, dinner to make,
chores to complete?

As we approach Election Day this year, ’

I have watched — at ﬁrst with surprise and
incredulity, then with respect, and slowly,
with admiration — as people around me
have become affected on a very personal
level by political aﬁairs. Some of the key
examples that come to mind:

'-At the rally forAl Gore held on Oct 27
at Carnegie Mellon University, I thought the
girl next to me was on the verge of a break-
down. We were near the back of the crowd;
our view was less than stellar. The girl turned
to her ﬁiend “I am so angry,” she spurted,
and I became frightened. “I can’t get up there
[toward the front of the crowd] because I
was in stupid class, and I am so angry and so
upset because I was so excited.”

This girl was visibly pained because she

couldn’t get any closer to the action; it was
that important to her. I watched as she plead-
ed unsuccessfully with one of the campaign
volunteers to help her move up in the crowd,
and later I cheered for Gore alongside her,
though my voice was not as loud as hers.

' - When I went home a few weeks ago,
my mom announced while we were eating
dinner that she was disgusted with both
Gore and George W. Bush. My mom is not
apathetic, but I wouldn’t categorize her as
the “political type” either. I did not think
much of her rant, I ﬁgured she would proba-
bly cornprornise her values and go for Gore.

But recently my dad informed me that
she is planning on voting for Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader. I was surprised; I
thought Nader was strictly a candidate for
hippies, college kids and alternative folls. I

did not anticipate that she would care enough -

to make the effort to ﬁnd out about his beliefs
and stances. But she did.

- My friend Jeffrey is a Republican and
he likes to make people mad He is constant-

ly raving ultra-conservative, ultra-elitist

schemes that he dreams up, probably
because he knows it makes my die-hard
democratic friends extremely angry.

On Saturday he attended ﬂre Gore rally
on the South Side with me, primarily
because he wanted to see James Taylor per-
form. Jeffrey attempted to smuggle in a
Bush/Cheney‘ sign and was heartbroken
when he found out that he was not permitted
to, though he did manage to sneak it in later
in the rally. Unsurprisingly,
Jeffrey washis usual self-at the
rally, making various obnoxious
comments, ‘but in a way I began
to admire his own twisted form
of passion '

I should confess that I too attended the
Gore rally mostly because I knew James
Taylor was going to perform. In support Gore,
but I had attended his rallyat CMU; I had
my fun, I cheered with the masses, I felt that
I adequately paid my dues.

Though I did enjoy hearing JT sing
three of his classic songs, the highlight of the
evening for me actually turned out to be
Gore’s speech. I was particularly touched
when Gore paused mid-speech as para-
medics rushed out to help" a man who had
apparenﬂy sulfered a heart attack After say-
ing a prayer for the man and his family,,Gore

digressed ﬁom the subject he had been pre- '

group Public Enemy, _ OWELL said, I reasoned that

me in a personal interview last
year, after giving a powerful lec-
ture to students at Duquesne
University. Chuck D realized that
there are many issues — such as
racism and sexism — that are not
addressed regularly by politicians.
If they are addressed, no action is
ever taken to effectively remedy
the problems. At the time, I had to
agree with him

Now nearly a year later, I ﬁnd
incredible comfort in the fact that
there is ﬁnally a presidential candi-
date who is addressing the social
problems troubling America This
candidate is the Green Party’s
Ralph Nader, whose primary focus
is promoting a more healthy social
environment as well as a sound
physical environment

Vlfrth the emergence of the
Green Party in this year’s election,

 

 

citizens can now vote for someone
who will truly serve their best
interests, rather than the interests of
corporations, whose very presence
corrupts the democratic political
process. This election year, citizens

only ones made to vote for whoev-
er goes against them the least.
Many voters, regardless of race,
vote for someone who they believe
leaves a lot to be desired, simply
because the other candidates seem
signiﬁcantly worse. , ‘
Imagine what might happen

if, along with the other choices on‘

the ballot, you had the option of
choosing “none of the above.”
Then imagine that the votes were
tallied and “none of the above”
actually won. If this were the case,
it would become clear that voter
apathy is not prevalent in society,
but rather a strong voter dislike for
the candidates and the stands they
take on issues.

Initially, I thought that maybe
I was crazy, that this idea of voting
for “none of the above” was just
another one of my silly notions.

That is, I felt this way until I
learned that someone shared my
feelings about it — Nader. In a
Rolling Stone interview, Nader
said one of the ﬁrst things he
would do if elected president
would be to change the election
ballot so that voters could check
“none of the above” if they were so
inclined, and ‘if this option won,
then another election would have
to be held.

‘ It was at that point that I real-
ized how truly different Nader is
from other candidates. This was

only the beginning of the love I‘

developed for this tree-hugging
Greenie. I

Because of Nader’s anti—cor-
porate stance, he can legitimately
claim that he wants to remedy such
problems as racism, sexism and
sweatshop labor. He will also
improve environmental standards,
education, health care andtestablish
a living wage. Other candidates
may claim that they will address
these issues, but their acceptance of
corporate contributions to their
campaigns will keep them ﬁom
serving any interests but those of
the corporations that support them.

It is important to realize that
the existence of social problems
such as racism and sexism perpet-

uate the imbalance of power in
America. These social injustices
keep people from working togeth-

er to establish better working con-
ditions, fairer wages and so ‘on?

because they are preoccupied with‘
racial and sexist prejudices. Instead
of uniting to better their situation as
a whole, many people are- busy
pointing ﬁngers at one another.
Chuck D touched on this sub-
ject in my interview with him. He
said, “Better education, better
knowledge of people, the histories
of people, histories of their oppres-
sion, is a necessity on helping end
racial prejudice, discrimination
and injustice.” This makes sense,
but how could education about
peoples’ histories and oppression

be taught, given that it would hurt

corporate interests?

Simply, it could not And it
will not occur as long as we have a
“democracy” in which the people’s
concerns and opinions are mean-
ingless compared to those con-
cerns and opinions of corporations.

The issues that Nader would
focus on once elected —‘ such as
sweatshop labor, environmental
standards and the establishment of
a living wage —— work in much the
same way. The reason why no
attempts have been made to correct

these problems and the reason why

there will not be any attempts _

made to correct them by other can-
didates S is that if attempts were
made, it would be to the detriment
of corporate America. Ending
sweatshop labor would  the
clothing industry. Administering
new environmental standards
would mean standing up to corpo-
rations that are destroying our nat-
ural resources. Establishing a liv-
ing wage would most likely mean
cutting into corporate proﬁts.

It is clear to me that Nader is
working not for corporate
America, but for the citizens of
America who have been living in a
society so far from being dernocra—
tic that they may have forgotten
what the word means.

Nader wants to remind us all
of the true meaning of democracy.
He wants to show us democracy in
action, the way it should operate.
Rather than being forced to “vote

for the lesser of two evils,” as ’

Chuck D so bluntly said,
Americans now have the chance to
vote for someone brave enough to
stand up to the forces working
against democracy.

Pull the wool
‘_‘Bamboozled”

Directed by Spike Lee  
amu

ERIC LIDJI
Staff Writer

A joint. That’s what writer/director
Spike Lee calls his films. They’re joint
efforts — several people coming together to
create something. “Bamboozled” is his lat-
est, and it is one goodjoint.

Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is a

» network TV writer who is told by his supe-

rior, Mr. Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport), to
stop creating “bad black shows.” The shows
that Dunwitty is referring to are shows that
portray black people as people instead of as
stereotypes or exaggerations. . I 0
In an attempt to show the foolishness of
all this, Pierre creates a new series based on

the minstrel shows
of the early 20th
century. He hopes
that the show will
shock Americans
' into change, but
instead it becomes a
national phenome-
non and his plan not
only backfires, but
becomes a tragedy.
The disturbing
trend in the past few
decades is the
decline in films that
are both entertaining
and socially impor-
tant. The medium of
film is so valuable
because people are

depending exclu-
sively on Visual
stimulation now
more than ever.

Movies are capable
of teaching and pro-
voking as well as
entertaining, but
more and more films
are just “high-octane
thrillers” with no
substance to back
them up. When that
excitement is com-
bined with a lesson, a message or a mean-
ing, that’s when the film industry stops
being a business and starts being a service.
It is no coincidence that Sidney Poitier
became the only black man to win Best
Actor the year after “To Kill a
Mockingbird” was released.

“Bamboozled” is a biting satire that
ranges from hilarious to terrifying. It
attacks its issues with dead-on precision.

Spike Lee is a smart director who under-
stands the principles behind filmmaking. He
knows how to create a wonderful story and
portray it in a way that amplifies it to its full
potential. He has found his niche -—- black
culture. —

' If Hollywood consisted of directors who
all had their own niches» like Lee and a few
other directors, then I guarantee that movies
would not only be smarter, but more inter-
esting and altogether better.

“Bamboozled” is only playing in one
Pittsburgh theater, the Loews Waterfront. It
is not known whether this number will be
expanded or not, but do not wait to find out.
This is an important film to see regardless
of race, gender or creed.

Political titillation

Red is a powerful color —— peo-
ple see red when they’re mad,
go in the red when they’re
broke. It’s so powerful, in
fact, that a whole political party
has come to be known by it.
Dressing in red is no easy
feat —- not everyone can
wear it. Some people pale
under a heady cranberry,
others appear garish next
to a tomato. The easiest way
I  p to get away with the hue is
 . .  throu h accessories, some-
Jennuer Meccarleue thinggthe Democratic and
Republican presidential candidates have learned very
well during their campaigning.
Both Al Gore and George W. Bush sported‘ the same
red tie during their first debate, a coincidence that no jour-
nalist, or civilian, let pass without brief mention. Both

  
 
 
  
 

’ men have been seen sporting red ties more than once in the

past month or so — Gore wore the same or different red tie
last weekend for his rally in the South Side, and Bush
wore one yesterday for one of his televised speeches.

Not to be outdone, I decided to find out what a little
red could "do for my life — would it make me feel power-
ful, sexy, broke?

The most needed accessory for a student is a bookbag,
and mine just happens to be a deep, fire engine red. I’ve
never felt particularly powerful wearing it, although the
way I sling it over my shoulder could be construed as sexy
in some cultures. And even though it’s very name-brand, it
set me back less than $10, definitely not breaking the
bank.

My crimson leather boots, with their side zippers and
clicky heels, sometimes make me feel commanding of
attention, but I usually become embarrassed by the school-
marmish clacks that echo throughout the Cathedral "as I
pass from class to class, and end up scuttling into the near-
est stairway. They also make me tower over most of the
boys I find attractive and, let’s face it, slouching is not
sexy. I

The one category of accessory that I have found red to
be very useful in is lingerie. I bought a little vermillion
ensemble this weekend, in fact — very sheer, very feath-
ery. By the look in the checkout boy’s eye, and the drool
swirling down my friends’ chins when I tossed it on the
counter, it was easy to tell that I had hit upon almost all of
the power/sex connotations that go with the color red.

Taking it home, and trying it on under the more ﬂat-
tering lights of my bedroom, I suddenly realized why red
is the biggest color of them all. I felt great — and I didn’t
care that I don’t have anyone to wear it for.

So what does my little red number and the candidates
little red ties have to do with each other? In truth, not
much. But I thought inserting a little sex into a political
discussion (of sorts) might make you wake up and realize
that today is Election Day. So go vote.

. With fall in full swing and winter
quickly approaching, it might be nice

to listen to some summer music , E

before it’s too late. Imagining warm
weather becomes impossible. And
what better way to pretend it’s sum-
mer than listening to light, meaning-
less pop music?

With this in mind, it’s not hard to
see why anyone would decide to
check out Tahiti 80’s Puzzle.

The cover and inside art looks
promising enough with two beachgo-

swimming in oceans of reds and

But unfortunately, the poppy

Train of Thought

Talib Kweli and Hi Tek
Rawkus Records

tttt

GREG ANDERSON
The Pitt News

The perfect union of an emcee

and his producer is a rare occurrence
in hip—hop. The chemistry between
the beat and the rhyme can elevate a
group to‘ legendary plateaus like Eric
B and Rakim or the two—hit combo
of Gangstarr’s Guru and Premier.
, After a few rides on Talib Kweli
and Hi Tek’s Train of Thought, it’s
evident that two more names are
about to be written in the rap history
books. .

Onceithe underground’s best-
kept secret, the pair known as
Reflection Eternal immediately
establishes their niche on “Move
Something” and “The Blast.” The
latter offers a surprise verse as
Cincinnati native Hi Tek steps from
behind the boards to prove that he’s
a “chameleon who adapts to any cir-
cumstance.”

On “This Means You,” Kweli
reconnects with his partner-in-
rhyme Mos Def, taking it back to
their classic Blackstar album. Once
the violin-laced beat kicks in, the

Brooklyn-born emcees waste no
time dropping their laundry list of
complaints on the “Rotten Apple.”

“The Y2K celebration wasn’t big
in New York/Babylon live in New
York,” Kweli raps. “Switched trains
so writers can’t get fame in New
York/Internet and Wall Street got
paid in New York/Poor folks and
working class got slain in New
York.”

The calm, soulful bass line and
subtle chimes on “Memories Live”
brings out the introspective lyrics
that Kweli is known for. Here he
“brings back sweet memories” on
topics ranging from house parties,
his son’s first sentence and his par-
ents’ divorce.

Tracks like this and the content
heavy “Good Mourning,” “For
Women” and “Love Language”
shine brightest. Kweli packs more
intelligence and substance into one
verse than most rappers have on
their entire al-bums. Hi Tek remains
on point with inspiring production,
setting the mood before the first
lyrics are said.

Their versatility is also dis-
played as Kweli proves that he’s not
only capable of cerebral ﬂows as he
brings battle raps on “Some Kind of
Wonderful” and the cipher style cut
“Down for the Count” featuring Rah
Digga and Xzibit.

With over 60 minutes of music
and no decline in verbal or sonic

quality, Talib Kweli and Hi Tek have

cemented their status as the standard
bearers for hip-hop’s future duos.

As Marcia Thiesen listened to a special pre-
sentation of the Canadian national anthem on
Sunday she prepared herself mentally for her
ﬁnal home appearance. '

As a senior, Thiesen accepted congratula-
tions from Pitt volleyball head coach Chris
Beerrnan and Dr. Ron Brown, director of acade-
mic support services for student-athletes, as she
received accolades from her parents and the fans.

“It’s something that just came to my attention
over the last month or so,” Thiesen said. “Then
this weekend it hit me. We’re done.”

Pitt honored Thiesen as well as its three other

seniors, Lisa Riggle, Stacy Renick and Jen

Nickels, before the match for second place
against Rutgers Sunday.

The Panthers lost to Rutgers 1-3 after sweep-
ing Seton Hall 3-0 earlier in the weekend.

Pittsburgh vs. Seton Hall

The Panthers swept Seton Hall in three
games to raise their record to 21-8 Saturday
morning. Pitt played host to the 8-18 Seton Hall

team who lost by the scores of 4-15, 10-15 and 9-
15. .-

“They play a slower speed butit kind of takes
you out of your game a little bit,” Beerman said.

Carrie Norris started the ﬁrst game with an
ace and the Panthers extended the initial lead
with a ﬁve-point run. The game ended with a
Renick kill.

Pitt struggled ‘as Seton Hall rallied by as

Thiesen lead the offense and defense with 16
kills and 15 digs, followed by Haff who also had
a double-double with 15 kills and 11 digs.

community came together for this year ’s Pitt/Penn State football game. We look
forward to receiving your suggestions regarding other athletic, social, academic,
service, community, and campus-based learning events that could become “Pitt
Traditions, ” events for which there is annual, enthusiastic and widespread V
students participation.

2. Timing of Events We invite your suggestions regarding which “Pitt Traditions”
might be day-long, several days, or all week events. ‘

We also wish to receive other recommendations regarding how best to build a sense of

Hawkins logged 30 minutes to lead the team, an
encouraging sign for a player who missed all of last
season with a broken ﬁbula. He had eight points and
six rebounds in that time. -

The Panthers jumped out to a 50-38 lead at the half
by shooting 57.1 percent in the first 20 minutes, before
making just 12 of 35 shots in the second half.

Pitt will be back in action Saturday against the
California All-Stars at 7:30 p.m. at Fitzgerald Field

Pitt’s men’s and women’s basketball teams began
their respective exhibition seasons successfully last
weekend, as the men’s team defeated Marathon and the
women’s team beat the Premier All-Stars.

Pitt 86, Marathon 85

Brandin Knight isn’t known as much of a shot
blocker, but maybe the 2001 season will be different
for the Pitt men’s basketball point guard.

Knight rejected a shot by Curt Smith in the ﬁnal
seconds as Pitt held on for an 86-85 exhibition victory
over Marathon Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House.

The blocked shot capped a big game for Knight,
who had 21 points, 10 assists, four rebounds and four
steals on the afternoon.

Knight was one of two Pitt players to record a dou-
ble-double on the day, as Ricardo Greer put up 18
points and pulled down 14 rebounds.

Pitt started a lineup that was much bigger than any
that was used last year. Knight and Greer were the
starting guards, while Zelimir Stevanovic, Isaac
Hawkins and Chris Seabrooks patrolled the frontcourt.

After being whistled for 11 fouls in Pitt’s Blue-
Gold intrasquad scrimmage, Seabrooks struggled
again Saturday. Heiwas called for the maximum ﬁve
fouls in just 16 minutes of action.

A bright spot off the bench was freshman guard
Julius Page, who had 12 points in 19 minutes. Also

Pitt 82, Premier All-Stars 70

The Pitt women used two scoring spurts in thesec-
0nd half to put away the Premier All-Stars, 82-70.

Up 34-32 at the half, Pitt went on a 15-6 run to
break the game open early in the half. But Premier ral-
lied to tie the score at 51 with 11:41 remaining.

Then Pitt came backwith a 11-4 run to go up 62-
55 with just over seven minutes left. One last rally by
Premier got the score down to 64-61~,with 5:27 to go. V
The Panthers hit their free throws down the stretch to 
get the victory. .

Mandy Wittenmyer led Pitt with 17 points, ﬁve
rebounds, four assists and four steals. Bettina Love
came off the bench to contribute 14 points, three
assists and two rebounds. Laine Selwyn added nine
points and six assists to the Pitt cause.

Monique Toney and Brooke Stewart started in the
Pitt backcourt. Selwyn was the small forward, with
Celeste Barkley as the power forward and Wittenrnyer
as the starting center. 1

Most unpredictable pro league? My
Election Day vote goes to the NFL

The Pittsburgh Steelers dropped to 5-4 Sunday
after losing to the Tennessee Titans, 9-7. Some
Steeler fans were upset that the team lost yet anoth-
er game it could have won. These same fans insist
that the Steelers could be 8-1 if all the breaks would
have gone their way this year. I have to disagree
with this philosophy.

Sure, the Steelers have lost some
games that they should have won. But
if you told me at the beginning of the
season that the Steelers would have a win-
ning record in November, I would have
thought you were crazier than Ross Perot’s
running mate in 1992, Adm. James
Stockdale.

"The Steelers aren’t a Super Bowl con-
tender. If the Super Bowl championship
question was on the ballot today, the
Steelers wouldn’t get any votes outside --
of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

- The NFL has been crazy this year,
hasn’t it? Sunday’s action brought me back to the
good old days, as both the Rams and the Colts lost.
It was only a few years ago when those two teams
would combine for about six wins per season. Now
they combine for six wins per month.

0 The surprise team in the AFC has

third time this season wide receiver Antonio Bryant received the
co-Big East Offensive Player of the Week (shared with Miami’s
Santana Moss) for his eight catches for 212 yards and a- touch-
down against North Carolina Saturday.

Bryant is a Miami native and always seems to get overly
excited for games against the Hurricanes. Harris -is convinced
that this year Bryant will be just as excited, but also just as pro-
ductive. Hanis also expects Bryant to be a big leader in the lock-
er room this week. , ‘

“[Bryant] is going to give the pregame  on Saturday,”.

Harris said. J _

Harris did have a few positive things to say about the team.
He first praised the Miami team by saying that they are the most
talented team Pitt will face this year. After that statement, Harris
praised Gary Urschler for his defensive play. .

“We are real excited about him being on our football team,”
Harris said. “He played like a champion. He did an outstanding
jo .” . .

Urschler came into the game after Corey Humphries left
with a shoulder injury. The only reason Humphries was in the
game was because of a knee injury to Ramon Walker. Walker is
listed as doubtful for Saturday and even though Humphiies is
listed as probable, Ham's announced that Urschler will start.

“Gary isbacking up Gary,” Harris said. 1.

Urschler was thrilled with his opportunity to play, but found
his ﬁrst game and interception to be bittersweet. V R A I t

“It feels pretty good, but it would have felt better if wehad
gotten a victory,” Urschler said. ‘-‘It felt good‘ to get in there and
make a pick. I just want to Tgovin there and help the team win.”

Urschler himself is suffering from a bruise. to his foot, but

he doesn’t expect to miss any practice time. i V; .
“It’s just a tweak,” Urschler said. “It’s nothing much, just a
bn1ise.I’ll be good.” 1 " ‘ , _, . .-

for a permanent head coach: Wayne
Fontes.

The ex—Lions coach doesn’t have
Scott Mitchell patrolling the sidelines
and making fun of his weight anymore,
so maybe Fontes could come back to
lead the Lions. That way they could
begin every season 3-7 and come back
to ﬁnish 9-7 and get a playoff spot, as
they did seemingly every year under
Fontes.

time in nearly two years, I think the loss
showed that the true MVP on the Rams
team is Marshall Faulk, not Kurt
Warner.

If Warner had played, he could not
have done much better than Green did.
Faulk had his knee drained a few hours
prior to game time and is out a couple of
weeks. His injury obviously hurt the
team much more. I said it last year after
Warner was named the league’s MVP
and I’ll say it again. Faulk, not Warner,
is the best player on the team and I
would cast my vote for him as the best
offensive player in the league.

Pitt News and he wants to elect Dave
Wannstedt as his coach of the year in the
