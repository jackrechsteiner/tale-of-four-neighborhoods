Tan discusses writing,
Ouija board labors

J. ELIZABETH STROHM

When Amy Tan was four and didn’t want to
go to bed one night, she lied and -
told her mother she couldn’t brush
her teeth because there were ghosts
in the bathroom.

Instead of yelling at her, her

mother to help her communicate with their spir-

its. Armed with a Ouija board and a teenager’s

cynicism, Tan gave her mother the answers she
wanted to hear in response to questions like, “Do
, you still love me?”

x‘ ‘ When hermother moved onto
questions about the stock market
and the family’s business life, Tan
usually replied with the briefest

Mess and art mingle while
studentsescape ﬁnals stress

KATHERINE BRINTON
Staff Writer

Feverish minds, bulging with complex
studies and course materials, burst with cre-
ative fervor.

Striving to add meaning to an otherwise
barren canvas, Pitt students indulged in the
lighthearted and often abstract art of ﬁnger-
painting last Tuesday. The elegance of the
William Pitt Union Ballroom clashed with
playful air in the room.

For one event in a four—part series called

Finals Survival week, Pitt Program Council  

bought approximately $75 worth of non-
toxic ﬁnger paints, shiny Crayola painting
paper and Styrofoam plates, which served as
primitive pallets. .

An assortment of ‘color choices "was
oifered, ranging from neon shades to prirna-
ry colors. The buffet- style selection of color
and paper led students to a round painting
studio, where they assembled their materials
and began the creation process.

Undergraduate student Alana Bly com-
mented on the consistency, texture and scent
of the paint, Another student said that the act
of ﬁnger-painting, as well as the “nauseous”
fumes, jolted her back to preschool.

Bly smeared a dripping puddle of paint

onto her palms and ﬁngers and carefully
pressed her hand onto the sterile canvas,
leaving behind a glittery, hot pink, black, and
silver imprint of her hand. She completed
the work with her signature: a thurnbprint.

Bly continued to paint two twirling-
fairies, one purple and one yellow. Absorbed
in her painting, she looked up and said, “I
just love color and texture.” .

Participating students left their ﬁnished
masterpieces behind because the globular,
thick paints took a long time to dry. *
Themes of Christmas often emerged in the
multitude of images. Green Christmas trees,
red, shiny bulbs and gold—g1it1ered stars
appeared throughout the night, all signs of
the oncoming Christmas jubilee.

Allison Martin, student and member of
the Leisure Learning Committee, instructed
and supervised the participants. . V

“It really relaxes you — it settles you
downj’ she said; Martin observed students
pouring the paints onto thepaper and mixing
from there. Some signed their names in the
pools of wet paint. .

Although the paintings were individual
expressions, each artist shared one thing in
common; each utilized an extension of him-
or herself ——‘ ﬁngers —.— as a tool for creative
outlet. . A

Fear stops testing, speaker says

MIKE MASLANIK
Staff Writer

Cryptosporidium shouldn’t scare most

, people, but for a person with AIDS, it kills.

. The relatively weak, though nasty, ill-
ness affects the stomach and causes as many
as 30 uncontrollable bowel movements a
day. A healthy immune system can knock it
out with case, but it can prove fatal to some-
one with AIDS.

Dr. Tony Silvestre, of Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health, discussed the
health problems associated with AIDS and
the importance of testing at a Rainbow
Alliance-sponsored lecture Wednesday.

“I want people to avoid HIV, get tested,
and-take the [medicine] you need, so in ﬁve
years, you don’t have an immune system
that’s shot to hell,” he said. A

Since the outbreak of the AIDS epi-
demic at the beginning of the 19805, 2,760
people in Allegheny County have been diag-
nosed with the  To give students -a
perspective of how widespread the problem
really is, Silvestre said that number, m11lti—
plied by seven, gives a ballpark ﬁgure of the
unreported cases. _

Matthew Moyer, director of the Youth
Empowerment Program, a division of the
Pitt Men’s Study that focuses on HIV out-

. reach, conducted a survey of Oakland resi-

dents between the ages of 13 and 25. When
 why they’d never  tested for

AIDS, 80 percent who qualiﬁed as “high
risk,” having had unprotected sex with two

or more partners in the last six months, did-

not get tested out of fear of testing positive.
Testing is important, Silvestre said,
because there are drugs. on the market that
can signiﬁcantly slow the viral process.
These drugs can cost as much as $3,000 for
a montl1’s supply, Silvestre said.
Silvestre went on to say that transmis-

- sion of the virus through sexual intercourse p

is easily preventable by the use of latex con-
doms. There have been efforts by Allegheny
General Hospital to start a legal needle
exchange program to curb infection through
injected drugs, like heroin, he added.
The”’rnost eﬁective way of dealing with
the AIDS crisis is through education,

Silvestre said He criticized the Pennsylvania _

Department of Education for inserting lan-
guage into the HIV curriculum regulations
that suggests schools should “omit explicit
instruction regarding the speciﬁc methods of
transmission when teaching students under
the age of 13.”
“We know, in Pennsylvania, there are
500 kids between the ages of 10 and 14 who
are pregnant and have babies,” he said. “We
' know, nationally,’ that about 7 percent of _stu-
dents indicate that they have had sexual
intercourse by the time they’re 13.”
Silvestre encouraged those in atten-

dance to write to Gov. Ed Rendell and “let  

him know how you feel about that.”

Penn State Republican picsin poor taste

Oh, Penn State! You ‘almost
make it too easy to mock you, with
your cows and your scandals con-
cerning campus political leaders.
Almost.

_ After photographs surfaced from
Penn State’s‘ College Republican
chairman’s Halloween party —
which featured such racially sensi-
tive costumes as a man impersonat-
ing the Undergraduate Student
Government Vice 3 President
Takkeem Morgan by wearing black-
face, and another dressed as a Ku
Klux Klan member —4 the Penn
State Black Caucus called for his
resignation.

Brian Battaglia, said chairman,

posted pictures on his Web site —

www.botag.net —- according to the
Dec. 4 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A '

Even better, than the pictures,
though, are the captions, particular-
ly the one concerning the KKKer,
which read, “He took a break from
cross burning to drink a cold one.”
The one under the man in blackface
referenced Morgan pleading guilty

to criminal mischief charges by say— '

ing “Apparently Takeem was
released we thank the local
police department.” 9
Now that seems like the type 0
thing someone with a future in poli-
tics wants to post onvtheir Web site.
He "clearly has a future in the
Republican Party, especially since

Trent» Lott stepped down as Senate
majority leader for making much
more oblique statements. Such com-
ments obviously dispel the notion
that the GOP has moved away from
its segregationist past and toward
the racial kumbaya jofithe 21st cen-
tury. Or, you know, not.

What’s more, as the representa-
tive and public face of ‘Penn State’s
chapter, Battaglia should have
known better. He’s a public figure

.on his campus, and should undergo

the scrutiny that-'all public figures
go through, the meticulous exami-
nation of their personal lives.

That he did not have the good
sense to exclude these pictures,‘ or,
at the least, not host such captions,
indicates a first-class kind of stupid-
ity — well, because he goes to Penn
State, a second—class sort. See, it’s
almost too easy.

We at The, Pitt News fully sup-
port making fun of campus leaders,
but donning blackface is all offense
and no humor, even if it is a
Halloween party and, ostensibly, all
fun and games. And captioning pic-
tures such pictures and giving them
Web space adds insult to offense.

The Halloween ’ photos were
removed yesterday, but Battaglia
should be feeling their repercus-
sions for a long time -— they may
have cost him his future within the
GOP.

enjoy reading Rubin’s columns, I. felt the
need to respond to this particular one.

As a black student at Pitt, I think it is
time for a critical analysis of campus
involvement within the historically under-
represented and segregated groups. Why is
Rubin so worried about black student
involvement in The Pitt News? Could it be
that Mock really was his only avenue to dis-
covering what the black experience at Pitt is
like? Is it because The Pitt News needs a
black perspective to ﬁmction?

As a matter of fact, The Pitt News used
to have a column called Black Perspective in
2000. For some reason, it no longer exists;
however, that does not mean that black stu-
dents are not editing, taking photographs or

writing. I am the editor of Pitt’s yearbook-

tunate martyr would be held accountable for
every ill-phrased sentence by those of their
race, and restrained by the color of their skin,
so that he or she couldn’t have an individual
opinion that did not reference to race.

If there are black students on campus
who want to be a part of The Pitt News or

Football! Commentating the war on terror, Madden—style

John Madden: “Hello, sports fans; I’m John Madden.”

Pat Sumrnerall: “And I’m Pat Sumrnerall.”

John: “Welcome to Monday Night War in Iraq! In
order to increase their pathetic ratings, Fox News has
reunited me with my old broadcast buddy, -

Pat, to call the football, er, wartime action for
you live, as it happens!”

Pat: ‘‘That’s right, folks, we will be telling
you what is happening in the war on tenor.”

John: “Yes, as the war on tenor contin-
ues, we will tell you what is happening in it.” ‘

Pat: “So, John, what do you think of
tonight’s match-up of United States soldiers
versus rogue, Iraqi guerrillas?”

John: “Well, the guerrillas are deﬁnitely
the , underdog, but their young rookie
‘Dangerous Omar’ has really showed some
promise. Last week, he shot two U.S. soldiers
in the back while they were taking a piss, and
this week, he has promised to blow himself up sometime
during the ﬁrst h .”

Pat: “What do you think of the United States’
chances?” . ,

John: “Well, if you remember that old—time Vretnarn
game, the United States seems to be taking a page out of

that playbook. Their plan of aimlessly running around, -

shooting things, hasn’t really worked so far, but let’s see if
they make a change in this ﬁrst quarter.”

Pat: “I-Iere’s the kick—off. President Bush has stepped
up to the podium and, yes, he’s saying something stupid
using made-up words. And ... it’s war!” .

John: “Look, most of Europe is heading in the other
direction! France seems to be out in front.”

Pat: “Even several members of Team America’ seem to
be hesitant to take the ﬁeld.”

John: “Football! We have casualties starting to pile up
here. Let me remind you folks that tonight’s casualties are

brought to you by oil. For all your car, truck, and economy-
based needs, oil —— it’s worth dying over!”

Pat: “Fudge, it looks like President Bush is in trouble
in the pocket there, John.” '

a John: “Oh yeah, big time. Bush is look-
ing for some chemical weapons to throw to,
but he can’t seem to ﬁnd any. Football! He’s

’ sacked.”

Pat: “Wow, John, the crowd is really let-
ting him have it. They’re booing like crazy.
They really seem to think Bush’s play—calling
is a bad idea.”

John: “In what appears to be a desperate
attempt to sell this war, the United States is
rolling out the cheerleaders. Look, there’s
Jessica Lynch wearing something skimpy.”

Pat: “I’m pretty sure that’s America’s
broadcasting ethics she has on, Jo .”

John: “You're right, Pat. Now to clarify
what you mean, her clothing is small because it represents
the small amount of ethics America has.”

Pat: “It’s like a symbol.”
John: “A very symbolic one at that, Pat. Oh, football!

Look at the scoreboard! It’s Bush’s budget plans for the

war! . _
Pat: “$87 billion! Wow, John, that’s only slightly larg-

: er than your paycheck!” ’ . .

John: “You’re right, Pat. I’m gonna circle with my
Telestrator every government program that won’t exist
after this war is over!.” I

Pat: “Gosh, John, itappears as if you’ve run out of
screen.” -

John: “You’re right, Pat. The scoreboard can’t hold all
the numbers either. I guess the referees will just have to
keep the oﬂicial count on the ﬁeld.”

Pat: “It looks like Donald Rumsfeld is in now at quar-
terback, Jo .” F

John: “Look at this! Rurnsfeld can’t read the play! It’s
almost as if he’s made up so much crap about thiswar
already that he can’t seemto even ﬁgure out what he’s real-
ly supposed to do.” _ »

Pat: “Hand off to Dick Cheney.”

V John: ‘‘What’s this? Cheney has run the ball off the
ﬁeld and apparently into an undisclosed location.”

Pat: “Looks like we’re going to have to take a time out
here, Jo .” ,

John: “You’re right. Now’s a good time to talk about
another of tonight’s sponsors, Terror-B-Gone anti-terror
spray. Just spray Terror-B—Gone in your kitchen, closets, or
dictatorship, and it cuts terror by 50 percent.”

Pat: “We’re back to the action here, John, with just
under a minute left to play.”

. John: “And it’s ‘Dangerous Omar!’ He’s run out to
rnid-ﬁeld and detonated the bomb strapped to his chest.
Wow, let’s watch that 17 more times in instant replay!”

Pat: “And that’s the half! John, the United States just
looks confused out there. They rwlly better get their act
together if they want to have any chance in the second
half.” - , .
John: “It’s almost as if they’re just making this war up

asthey go along.” — -

Pat: “We’re going to have to take another short break
so the President can serve Thanksgiving dimer to the

A troops. Hopefully Bush also has something good cooked

up for his second-half rebuilding process.” ‘

John: “I hope so, too, American public — I mean, Pat.
Please stay tuned for our halftime show featuring Paris
Hilton having sex with Michael Jackson on top of the phys-
ical manifestation of shame.”

Challenging the shopping cart demons on the rnostunholy of weekends

Even through their protective glaze of

feigned civility, my eyes sought desperately-

for some means to save me from the roiling
masses of bleating, sale—starved sheep. Their
eyes, burning feverishly, were focused on
rack after rack of fantastic bargains, and
they were thus unrnindful of the gleaming
metal chariots of toe—cn1shing, shin—shatter-
ing doom they pushed before them

Deliverancewould not come easily.

Until this time, I had lived in blissful
ignorance, unaware of shopping hell, and
the ravening horde of cart-wielding maniacs
that descended on every mall and depart-
ment store across the nation.

 had a strict rule for allowable day-
after-Thanksgiving activities: nothing more
strenuous than video games, reading or nap-
ping. Consequently, my Thanksgiving
break had remained a restful, leisurely affair,
leaving me suﬂiciently rejuvenated to return
to classes with minimal bitterness.

But this year, I spurned the guidelines
that had successfully led me through years
of happy Thanksgivings. I did, after all,
need to buy something: a sole article of
clothing.

How bad could it be? It’ll just be a few
minutes of searching before I can leave the

crowds of frenzied shoppers behind and
retum to my normal routine of lethargy and
leftovers.

Firm in my resolve, secure in my con-
ﬁdence, I stepped into the department store
without the slightest doubt that I would be
exiting again in no more than a
half an hour. Two hours later,
glowering, limping and strain-
ing under the Weight of my
shopping bag, I ﬁnally crossed
the threshold to freedom and
hurled one lastcaustic oath at _
the monolithic shrine to capi-
talism behind me.

Everything went accord-
ing to plan until I actually
found what I was looking for.
After triumphantly holding
aloft my single article of cloth-
ing, I smugly sauntered toward the nearest
cashier.

Ah, but what have we here? Pants? I’ve
heard such things are pretty useful. Guess I
might be able to use a pair or two while me
kilt is at the cleaners. Besides, I’ve plenty of
time. Might as well at least try them on.

Having suﬂiciently rationalized this‘

continued foray into the men’s clothing sec-

tion, I slithered between two inconveniently
close racks to inspect“ my trouser options.

occupied thicket of close-
hanging pants. At this
moment, clutching the rack in
front of me in a painful,
spread—eagled embrace, with hangers slow-
ly embedding themselves in my throat, I
began to question my venturing out this day.
I Finally, Blorpy managed to ooze his
way out of my aisle, and I could continue

Crawford Grill celebrates 60 years

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

You see pieces of Jorge Myers’ art-
work when you drive through the Hill
District. They are the urban gardens in
the lots of demolished building and the
Technicolorpmurals that bear his tag.

Most nights, you’ll ﬁnd Myers talk-
ing up the patrons and listening to the
jazz music at The Crawford Grill on
Wylie Avenue in the Hill.
The artist lives in an apart-
ment above the place and
acts as a kind of unofficial
spokesman for the old jazz
club. He grew up on the Hill
with the Crawford Grill and
thinks the place still has
strong cultural value to the
Hill District community.

“If you wanna describe
the Hill District, you have to
come in the Crawford Grill
to understand the descrip-
tion, to understand the diver-
sity,” Myers said. “This is
the bar that, if you’re a
politician, if you’re a writer,
if you’re anybody, you have
to come here. This is like the
central part of Harlem.”

Opening for business in
November 1943, at 2141
Wylie Ave., the Crawford
Grill Concert Hall and
Lounge was the second
“Crawford Grill” opened by '
“numbers baron’? William A.
(Gus) Greenlee, who also
owned the Pittsburgh
Crawfords Negro League
baseball team. With the help
of business partner Joseph Robinson,
the Crawford #2 quickly became
famous as a cultural meeting place and
a venue for great jazz music.

According to Myers, it was after "

Joe Robinson’s son, “Buzz,” took over
as owner that the place gained notoriety
with nationally known jazz acts coming

through.

“He was the one that, firstly, started
out with Charles Mingus. Then came
Art Blakey, arid the rest was history, as
far as jazz was concerned in the
Crawford Grill,” Myers said.

By the time the Crawford Grill #2
opened, the Hill District already had a
long history of racial and cultural diver-
sity. Blacks, whites and other ethnicities
had moved into the bluffs east of

i_Downtown Pittsburgh to form a unique
mix found in few, if any, other commu-.

nities in America. ' ,

Between the 1930s and 1950s, peo-
ple used to refer to that area’s shops,
stores and nightlife as “Little Harlem.”
The area was called “The Crossroads of
the World” because Pittsburgh fell geo-
graphically between the twin giants of
northern “Jazz Age” culture. New York
City and Chicago had renowned jazz
venues, like Birdland and Mr. »Kelly’s.
Pittsburgh venues, like the Hurricane

Music Room, the Aragon Ballroom and
The Crawford Grill #2 acted as the
main musical waypoints between the
two larger cities. "

In the 1950s, Pittsburgh decided to
redevelop the lower Hill District.
During the 1960s, everything below
Crawford Avenue, where the Civic
Arena now stands, was leveled and
rebuilt under the direction of the Urban
Redevelopment Authority. Taking away
stores and cultural venues eliminated
the area’s socioeconomic center, and
the following decades saw a prolonged
economic downturn along, with what
Myers termed a large “white exodus.”

Myers was born in 1957, at the end
of the golden age of Pittsburgh Jazz. He
grew up in ,a community that, despite
the hardships, retained civic responsi-
bility regardless of race.

“It wasn’t like it was just black peo-
ple that were poor. They was all poor.
They all helped each other. They all
knew that they needed each other to
survive,” Myers recalled of that turbu-
lent period.

“That destroyed the family,” he
said. “You basically put a hole right in
the middle of the community. Now you
got Polish Hill. Now you got

Bloomﬁeld. Now you got .Squirrel Hill.

‘Patrons are absorbed in eclectic bands, a regular form of entertainment at the Crawford Grill.

All those communities was once the
Hill District. And when the second or
third generation came along, they didn’t
understand their roots. They didn’t
understand the connection. The Hill
District don’t ‘belong’ to black people.

. The Hill District belongs to all people.”

Myers tries to preserve that fading

-era by collecting artifacts from rotting

buildings and aging Hill residents to

turn into art. It can be challenging. He’s-

found himself staring down Pittsburgh
police guns after emerging from an
abandoned storefront and known drug
den, with what Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
columnist Tony Norman described as “a
zoot suit in one arm and a ram’s horn in
the other” that he had scavenged for his
artwork. "'

The Crawford Grill is one of sever-
al establishments in the neighborhood

whose walls bear his Hill District art
collages. Naturally, each piece has a
story.

One collage uses pieces of ‘a trum-
pet and part of a fur coat. That coat was
stitched together by a black Hill District
furrier who did, unbeknownst to most
of their white clientele, the sewing work
on many furs that appeared in the store
windows of Kaufmann’s department
store for decades.

A piece that holds special sig-
niﬁcance for Myers is one using
_ the bass of jazz great Leroy Brown,
who was once known by his con-
temporaries as the “Duke Ellington
of Pittsburgh.” It was given to him
by the musician’s German-speak-
ing widow, who still lives above
the Crawford. Myers respects the
fact that she didn’t leave the Hill --
and the Crawford Grill —— during
the racial exodus that accompanied
the economic backlash caused by
‘60s redevelopment.

“Now I always ask her,” Myers
said, “‘You didn’t have to’ stay here
on the Hill. Why did you stay

She said to me, ‘Where could I go
in the world that’s gonna give me
what this place gave me?’ And that

‘ means a lot, because she could go
anywhere, but she stays right here,
and she’s still upstairs.”

Myers sees the music, art and
literature produced in the Hill,
including his own, as being essen-
tial to preserving the cultural lega-
cy of the community.

’ “I’m no different from August
. Wilson. I’m no different than

Leroy Brown. I’m no different than
George Benson. I just do it in a differ-
ent medium. I’m just a visual artist, and
these guys are doing it in a different
type of art, but it’s all art and it’s all
inspiration and it’s all a placement in
the history of this community.”

Jazz music is the bedrock the
Crawford Grill is built on. Mondays,
Fridays and Saturdays are jam nights,
and if you have the instruments and ﬁnd
an open time slot, you can get up and
jam, too.

As long as jazz music is the focal
point of the Crawford’s sound, Jorge
sees the place retaining cultural signifi-
cance on the Hill long after its 60-year
anniversary, which was celebrated in
November.

“Everybody wants to go to a place
that brings everyone together in harmo-

Kiss, kiss; urine for quite a show with MSI

What do you get when you combine hardcore elec-
tronica with sex? Sleazecore! And the masters of the
genre, Mindless Self Indulgence, will be headlining a
tour at Nick’s Fat City this weekend.

MSI is a band that’s been around for a few years.
After the release of Frankenstein Girls May Seem
Strangely Sexy, MSI’s popularity skyrocketed. Videos
of the band can be found online from the early days of
light, where they were playing nearly empty clubs of
die-hard fans. Now it’s very difﬁcult to get tickets to the
shows because they’re so ridiculously popular for the
genre. Fans of hardcore, punk, electronica and every-
thing in between love MSI. But you either love them or
hate them. People can be found on the streets saying that
MSI is one of the worst bands of all time, while others
profess that they are one of the best bands of all time.

Lead singer Jimmy Euringer —— known to fans as,
simply, Jimmy Urine — has done everything from
drinking his own piss to dressing up in stockings. The
man is undoubtedly the most deranged of the four-piece,
and will deﬁnitely interact with the crowd — he’s made
out with boys and girls at random near the stage, and

you can’t expect any less for the show in Pittsburgh. You '

should be safe as long as you aren’t egging him on. But
if you’re going to see MSI, you probably want to get
involved. ’

Another band coming to town with MSI, Chicago’s
Tub Ring, uses so many different genres for their songs
that you can’t even decide if they were serious or not for
deciding them — they range from “Power Pop” to
“Experimental/Post Rock.” The music features bells and
Theremins and wonderfully deranged sounds through-

out the songs. It’s all about variety with these boys. ‘

Brooklyn’s Uncle---er will also be on the bill as a
support act. They describe their sound as “a mix of hay
bale hardcore and hillbilly metal venom.” One critic has
even said that they sound like a cross between a sunrise
and a monster truck. Awesome! ’

Expect nothing less than the sleaziest and raunchi-
est action when MSI tears through our wonderful, little
town. Just don’t cry to mo y if Jimmy makes out
with you. And don’t say I didn’t warn you!

Mindless Self Indulgence, Tub Ring and UncleF--—er

will be performing at Nick’s Fat City on the South Side -

Saturday. Doors open at 7 p. m. and tickets are $15. Call
(412) 48] -6880 for more information.

Panthers prepared

RAWIOND NEWBY
Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team will be

"playing a meaningful match in.

December for the first time in?-nearly
a decade when they take on the
University of Pennsylvania tonight at
5 p.m. in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament. V

The Panthers (25-5) eamed,_an _

automatic berth to the Tournament by
capturing the Big East title with a
victory over reigning champ --Notre
Dame on Nov. 23. Pitt was also a co-
champion of the Big East in the reg.-
ular season, tying the Fightinglrish
with an 11-1 conference record.
“W_e’re as good as we’re going to
get,” head coach Chris Beerma-n said.
“Right now, it’s about execution and
playing with confidence and playing\

‘ to win. [It’s also about] playing to be

not satisfied with what we’ve done so
far -—- to keep winning and take this
season. as far as; we can take it.”

Pitt was placed in bracket for the

first and second rounds with other
Pennsylvania teams — Penn State,

Penn-and Robert Morris —- with the

for opening round

games to be held in State College, Pa.

The NCAA doesn’t seed all 64
teams in the tournament, only teams
1-16, with each of the 16 teams host-
ing matches in the first two rounds.
Penn State is ranked 11th, which is
why_it is playing host. ‘

Penn State takes on Robert
Morris in the first-round matchup on
Friday.) The winner will face the Pitt-
Penn game7s winner tomorrow at 7
p.m. That winner will advanceto -the
regional semifinals in Gainesville,

‘Fla. _ \\J

Beerman says the team is taking

it one match‘ at a time and won’t
overlook the Ivy; League champs. But
it’s hard not to look past the first
round" to a possible showdown with
Big Ten champs Penn State, who beat
Pitt earlier this year on a neutral
court. ,
“If we are lucky enough to play
Penn State in that final, you [have to]
let it all hang out. You have to beat
Penn Stateat Penn State. It’ll be the
hardest match of the year if we do get
that far.” i

The Panthers, playing in their
first NCAA Tournament since 1994,

are 4-4 against other teams who made

the tournament. They" beat Notre ~

Dame twice and also defeated
American and Robert Morris, while
losing to Penn State, 16th-seeded
Texas A&M, Dayton and Pacific. -
The Quakers (20-6), winners of
their third-straight Ivy League title,

are 2-2 against tournament teams,
with victories over Manhattan and
Robert Morris and losses to Pacific
and 4th-seeded Pepperdine.

This will be the ninth trip to the
NCAA Tournament for the Panthers,
who have advanced to the second
round only twice.

The regular season is over-for Pitt, but Larry
Fitzgerald is still receiving —— awards that is.
They are raining down on him like touchdown
passes from quarterback Rod Rutherford.

The Panther wide receiver’s, latest‘accom-
plishment is The Pitt News_Male Athlete of the
Fall award, selected by the paper’s Sports staff.

It’s-no Heisman Trophy, but you cannot deny
that he deserves this honor. His 22 touchdown
catches and 1,595 receiving yards lead the coun-
try and overshadow all other performances by
Pitt athletes this fall.

He also leads the country in yards per game
(132.9) and he is third in the nation in points
scor-ed per game (11.0). ’

Need another reason for why he was named

Male Athlete of the Fall?

A How about the fact he kept the NCAA and
the Big East buying more bottles of Wite-Out by
rewriting the record books _during almost every

Larry Fitzgerald hands the ball to an official after
scoring a touchdown against ’

game.

Hey, NCAA —-— get out your erasers. The
record for receiving touchdowns in consecutive
games is now 18 and counting, and the record for

Brokenrecords ighligt Fitgerald’s season

total touchdowns scored by a player during
freshman and sophomore seasons is now 34 —
all thanks to the man wearing the number 1 on
his jersey. Kind of appropriate, isn’t it?

He also tied the NCAA record for catching a
touchdown in all 12 games this season, and can
find his name next to his good pal Randy Moss,
who scored in all 12 games with Marshall.

Fitzgerald now holds six Big East records.
His single—season touchdown and career-receiv-
ing touchdown marks are both Big East records.
His 87 catchesthis season are a new Big East
best, along with his 1,595 yards. His 14 100-yard
receiving games and his two 1,000-yard seasons
are also Big East records.

But all these recordsand awards mean little
to Fitzgerald, and he’s let . that be known
throughout the entire season.

“Honestly, I’m.just trying to go out there and

win,” Fitzgerald said after the game against
‘Syracuse earlier this season. “But records are

meant to be broken, and who’s to say somebody
doesn’t come by and break my record.”

Player of the Year award among many for Hatlestad,

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

In volleyball, an attack that
slams immediately into the other
team’s floor or off of an opponent
and out of bounds is called a kill.
Pitt senior Wendy Hatlestad record-
ed a team—high 503 of them this sea-
son for the Pitt women’s volleyball
team (25-5) and was selected by the
Sports staff as The Pitt News
Female Athlete of the Fall.

“The hardest thing was staying
consistent the whole year,”
Hatlestad said, via a telephone

Consistency, however, didn’t
seem to be a problem this year.
Hatlestad finished second among
the Panthers in kills per game, with
4.88, raising her average by more
than a kill per game from last sea-
son.

From‘ the position ofoutside hit-
ter, she also amassed 21 assists, 14

ticed. Hatlestad was named the Big
East Volleyball co-Player of the
Week twice this year and was also
named the conference’s Player of
the Year.

Hatlestad led the Panther attack
as Pitt sped away with its 11th Big
East title.

I “We t-ried to go into every game
with respect for the other team,”
she said. “[We started to realize] we
can hang with anyone.”

Hatlestad put together 210 kills
against Big East competitors, with
only a slight drop in kills per game
from that of her total record.

Highlights of Hatlestad’s season
included a season-high 30 kills in a
Panther loss to Oregon State and an
emotional high in her dominant per-
formance against Miami.

“It was one of those things
where I almost had the mindset of,
‘I dare you to stop me,”’ Hatlestad
said. “That was a big game.”

She finished with 27 kills and
three service aces against the
Hurricanes.

The Panthers. eventually won
the conference by defeating Notre
Dame, the defending champions, on
the road.

In the championship match,

Hatlestad racked up 14 kills and’

five digs while Pitt Won in three
straight games. '

In the regular season, I the,

Panthers established a series of

' streaks, at one point winning 18 of

19 matches, broken up only by a
loss to Virginia Tech.

Hatlestad, however, asserted
that her goal for the year was
steadiness, to back up excellence.
“It was a pretty solid year,” she
said. “We kept saying, ‘What are
we? We’re go‘od.’” ’

Pitt’s Allen gets good returns

MATT SORTINO
Staff Writer

As a high school star at James F.
Byrnes High School in South
Carolina, Terrell Allen was named
first team All-State and helped his
team to a state title his senior year
as a four—year starter. _

As a freshman wide receiver at
Pitt, he hoped to make an impact at
receiver right away, but when he
arrived on campus, he found -himself
behind another young receiver ‘on
the depth chart -— All-American and
Heisman Trophy candidate Larry
Fitzgerald. Allen refused to be dis-
couraged and worked even harder to
become a familiar name in the
Panther’s program. 1

Instead of fading into the back-
ground, Allen found a way to catch
the eyeof the coaching staff and get
on _the field anyway he could.
Thanks to his blazing speed, Allen
became a threat as a kick returner
and on the reverse from the receiver
position. For the season, he aver-

aged 24 yards a return, including a
season—long return of 63 yards
against Miami. Allen rushed‘ the ball
four times for a total of 36 yards,
including a 34-yard scamper,
against Texas A&M.

For his efforts during the entire
football season, Terrell Allen has
been named The Pitt News 2003
Freshman Male Athlete of the Fall.

“I am honored to be selected by
The _l_3itt News as the freshman male
athlete of the fall. I’m very grateful
for my coaches and teammates.
Their guidance, hard work and ded-

ication have helped me tremendous- »‘

ly,” Allen said, during a phone inter-

I view. “We are all looking forward to:

getting a victory in our bowl game
and continuing our momentum asia
program in the future.” ‘

Allen is one of Pitt’s many tal-
ented receivers, along with
Fitzgerald, Princell Brockenbrough
and fellow freshman Greg Lee, and
is perfectly content with contribut-
ing to the Panthers in any way he
can.

  After stellar high school career, Brill

continues success at collegiate level

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Carli Brill’s 2003 performance
on the soccer field earned her the
‘honor of being The Pitt News’
Freshman Female ’Athlete of the
Fall. 4 '

She started all 17 games this
season and recorded a goal on 14
shots, from the defensive position.
Her one goal on the season came in
a 5-1 win over Jacksonville, early
in the year.

“We’re really _proud of her,”
Dawn Brill-Cooper, her mother,
said. “She always gives her 100
percent in everything.”

Brill has won several awards
before, on, and off the field. She
was named Penn Manor All-Around
2002-03 Female Athlete her senior
year of high school and also won
the Academic» Excellence Award

and The Ditlow /Award for charac-
ter. . ‘

She recorded 32 goals. and 18

assists in her high school career at
Penn Manor. With those numbers,

‘ . she helped Penn Manor qualify for

the district playoffs for three con-

secutive years. . -

“I can’t wait for next season,”
Brill said. “[The team has]
improved so much. We’re only get-
ting better.” i _ _

The team has several players
returning next year, and Brill looks
forward to lacing up the spikes and

- getting back onto the field, so she

can help her team climb the rank-
ings of the Big East. This past sea-
son, the women’s soccer team went

~ 5-10-2, with several close losses.

,“The -games are so fun,” she
commented. '

Brill was also shocked on
Tuesday with the announcement
from the National ‘Soccer
Coaches Association of America
that she has earned NSCAA/Adidas
Girls High School All-America
Honors. She is one of seven defend-
ers nationally named to this 74-
member team. A —

“I did not expect it at all,”,Brill
said. “‘It’s a big honor.”

“We’re so thankful that she is
being recognized,” Brill-Cooper
said. ‘ '
