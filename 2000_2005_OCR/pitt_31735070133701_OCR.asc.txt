VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 109

Ford recounts
life story in  

  only one hour

GREG HELLER—LABELLE
. Senior Staff Writer

A The Southem gentleman in Richard
Ford was apparent from the moment he
stepped onto the stage. He stood at least a

foot taller than the woman who introduced _

him, towering over her as he gave her a

A ' digniﬁed hug. He smoothed his navy blaz-
‘ er, gripped the side of the podiumlwith

sturdy hands and. thanked everyone for

coming. ‘ ’ '
“Organizing a lecture like this,” he

said, “is a lot like going through my pock-

’ ets at the end of the day and looking for

$1,000.” ,
The audience laughed at his grace in

what was surely an unusual situation. They
T . knew Richard Ford for telling stories, not-
talking about himself.‘ 0

But last night, as a guest of the Drue
Heinz Lecture Series, Ford took a break
from the profession he described as “mak-
ing things up” to talk about how he does
the work of writing. He apologized in

advance for talking about his job, a task he 1

said was always boring for everyone
except the speaker.

“Unless,” he said, “they’re strippers.
Or paid assassins. Or something like that.”

Ford, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of “Independence Day” and “Rock
Springs,” began by quoting Henry James,
calling talk about oneself “the feast that
starves the guest.” «

“I’m going to talk about myself,” Ford

i said with his understated draw], “and hope
. that I won’t starve you.” n
The hour-long narrative of Ford’s path '

to being ‘a writer began with speculation
about his parents, who he said never
explained anything to him, deciding
instead that he would be happier with

- many mysteries of his extended family

unknown to him. Ford cited what his par-

ents said to him the most, aside from that

they loved him: -
“‘Oh, Richard, you don’t need to

' know that.”’ V

. As the crowd laughed, Ford jumped
ahead to the time he spent with his dying
mother when he, in his late 30s, asked
about the same mystifying family lore that
he had as a young boy. _

PPC event teaches
the etiquette basics e

from soup to dessert L

EMILY COLLEY
For The ‘Pitt News

Abnormally large vegetables aside,

Pitt Program Council’s etiquette serni—
nar last night briefed Pitt students on
how to ace the table manners of any
important business dinner. A , ‘

' Guest speaker ’ Corene -B. Ashley
said she began speaking to groups of
young people when she realized_that no
one _was -teaching them what was

expected during proper social situations. .

“Many, of you will graduate soon
and have interviews for jobs,”Ashley

said.’ “Some of thesemay occur at‘ 
restaurants and you want to give a good _

impression.” — .

V PPC decorated’ Dining Room A in
the William Pitt Union to look like_ a
high-class restaurant. Chandeliers hung
above the six—person tables and dimly lit
the large room full of approximately 40
aspiring etiquette pros. Every place set-
ting held two spoons, forks,‘knives and
a dark green napkin folded into a fan. A
glass of ice water and a roll awaited the
diners‘ when they sat.

The night began with Ashley ques-
tioning the group. about dining scenarios
they might face in the future. '

“What would you do if an old friend
called you up unexpectedly and wanted
to go to eat at anice restaurant around

the city? Where would you start to look?. '

What types of questionswould you ask
/when you call a certain restaurant?”
Ashley recommended. consulting

.the Intemet and the phone book, and’

questions ranged from dress code and
method of payment to whether the
eatery accommodates speciﬁc dietary
needs such as vegan. ,

“Ladies be ladies,” Ashley said.
“Let the gentlemen be gentlemen. Let
them escort you, open your doors -and
hang your coat. a '

“The waiter is not your servant.’

They are your servers. They are the
most important individuals to you. You
are their honored guest and they are
there to help make your dinner comfort-
able and relaxing,” Ashley said. “ Don’t

be afraid to ask them questions.”

The diners were served a ﬁve-
course meal as Ashley continued to brief
them in dining‘ etiquette. The strong
aroma of vegetable soup spread through

a the room as questions of whether to

slurp or not to slurp were being
answered.
“Soup, along ‘with corn on the cob,

spaghetti and asparagus, is one of the’

difficult dishes at a dinner. Itshould be
quietly sipped and blown on if it is too
hot,” Ashley said.

The chunky vegetable soup, full of

"large pieces broccoli, cauliﬂower and

various other vegetables, seemed a little
difficult to sip‘.

“How are you supposed to sip large
vegetables?” one diner asked.

“ Is it proper to cut it up with the
back of your spoon?” asked another.

Ashley said she had never seen veg-

etables that big in soup before and that
the diners should still use their knives to
cut the chunks.

The soup bowls were taken away

and the immense size of vegetables con- _

tinued as the waiters presented the sal-

ads. A large piece of red cabbage was _

nestled into a bed of lettuce covered in
light dressing and chopped walnuts.
Zucchini, tomatoes and soft cheese also
adorned the second course.

The wine selection was taught with
a simple rule.

“Match the color of the wine to the
color of the entree,” Ashley explained.
‘,‘Chicken and ﬁsh go with white wine
and -beef goes with red wine.”

next and the diners. got a chance to prac-

Bread for the World calls attention to hunger anfdstw-aste

CHARLOTTE TUCKER _ V A g
Assistant News Editor A

A group of Pitt students donned aprons and rubber gloves

yesterday and began a bizarre collection. As Sodexho workers

wheeled the stacked trays of students’ food into the kitchen of the

_ cafeteria, members of Bread for the World sorted the garbage,
dumping the food into trash bags that they later weighed.

After the 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. lunch rush, the group had col-
lected 229 pounds of food that students had taken from the cafe-
teria but not eaten.

Alexis Tretiak, the campus adviser of Bread for the World,
said the group measured the trashed food as a way to make Pitt
students more aware of the waste they create each day. Tretiak
said there is enough food in the world for each person to eat more
than 2,700 calories per day, but that the lack of planning sur-
rounding the distribution of the food means that it doesn’t get
where it’s needed. «

“It’s just a lack of political will,” she said. “We could cut
hunger in half  by focusing aid to Africa.”

Tretiak said that many people aren?t aware of the severity of
the hunger problem both in the United States and abroad. She
cited the "statistic that 24,000 people die from hunger every day
— the equivalent of three Boeing 747s crashing every hour of
every day. _

Bread for the World, which T retiak said is the largest grass-
roots organization -in the "country, focuses its efforts on letter-
writing campaigns and making the community more aware of
hunger related issues. In June it will host a hunger banquet at
which each attendee will be randomly assigned a social class, a
metaphor for people’s inability to choose their economic stand-
ing in society. Then, Tretiak said, throughout the course of the _ _ , ‘ . _

Health and Safety director returns to bl

BRIAN LIBERATORE
Staff Writer

In the depths of the Benedum
Hall basement, through a pair of
metal doors that open the wrong

way and past an office door that is

always open, Pitt’s steward of safe-
ty sits at his immaculate wooden
desk. ‘

Jay Frerotte, a Pittsburgh native
and director of Pitt’s environmental
health and safety department since
Jan. 7, speaks fondly about his
return to Pittsburgh and his duties as
the department’s new headman.

The department of health and
safety is responsible for maintaining
safe work environments and keeping
the University in compliance with
safety regulations.

’ “We span everything from fire
safety in dorms to chemical hygiene
and blood-borne pathogens ' in

-research environments and every-

3

where in between,’ Frerotte said
explaining his.department’s duties.

Frerotte held similar duties dur-
ing his 18-year tenure at Johns
Hopkins Hospital and University ‘in
Baltimore. But he is glad to be
home, he said.

“It’ll be easy for me to come back to
the black and gold.”

After 20 years away from the
city, Frerotte finds his return has its
challenges. Aside from getting reac-
quainted with Pittsburgh’s notorious
roadways and colorful locals,
Frerotte has had to find his way
around the University.

“The tough thing is learning all

the buildings,” Frerotte said. The‘

department’s jurisdiction covers Pitt
buildings on and off the main cam-

pus — more than 200 total.’’

. Frerotte feels he has a responsi-
bility to students, teachers and staff
in all these buildings.

“I’m here to support the faculty
and the University in teaching stu-
dents and advancing research, which
is Pitt’s mission,” Frerotte said.

In addition to maintaining the

department’s current responsibili- »

ties, Frerotte hopes to expand its
presence.

“I want people to see us as
resource,” Frerotte said. “There are
a lot of talented people [in this
department]. That’s another reason I
came here.”

According to Frerotte, anyone

Media war turns ugly, Texas morn trialbegins

President stresses security in Paciﬁc

TOKYO — President Bush, using his
swing through Asia to deliver fresh Wam-
ings that he is prepared to carry the war on
terrorism beyond Afghanistan, told the
Japanese parliament Tuesday that the two
nations must work together to defuse threats
to peace throughout the Paciﬁc.

Bush told Japan’s Diet that the two
nations “share a vision for the future of the
Asia-Paciﬁc region as a fellowship of free
Paciﬁc nations,” and reafﬁrmed the U.S.
commitment to regional security.

“We stand more committed than ever

to a forward presence in this region,” Bush '

said. “We will continue to show American
power and purpose in support of the
Philippines, Australia and Thailand. We will
deter aggression , against the Republic of
Korea”

Bush’s remarks underscored the long-
standing U.S. commitment to regional
security in the Paciﬁc. But they come at a
time when the war against terrorism is forc-
ing the United States to confront new
threats. .

The U.S. military has recently begun
training troops in the Philippines to ﬁght the
Abu Sayyaf guerrilla group. In recent
weeks, authorities have also identiﬁed a
sophisticated terrorist organization in
Southeast Asia aﬁiliated with Osama bin
Laden’s al-Qaida network. Since early
December, police in Singapore, Malaysia
and the Philippines have arrested more than

three dozen suspected members of the

group, known as Jemaah Islarniah.

School vouchers to get US. Supreme

CLEVELAND — Tomorrow, the
Supreme Court hears arguments in a case
challenging the voucher program created
by Ohio lawmakers six years ago to offer

United Airlines and its mechanics

union reached a tentative agreement on a-

new contract Monday, averting a crippling
rnid-week strike against the nation’s sec-
ond—largest air carrier.

The new agreement was worked out in .

round-the-clock weekend negotiations in
which the two sides altered a contract pro-
posal offered by a special emergency board
to help meet the concerns of the

War coverage turns negative .
WASHINGTON — When U.S. sol-
diers conducted a raid north of Kandahar,

Afghanistan, on Jan. 24, it was initially V

reported as an American victory.
Days later, however, a few reporters in

Afghanistan began challenging the ofﬁcial,

accounts, eventually prompting the
Pentagon to acknowledge that those cap-
tured were not Taliban members after all.

After ﬁve months in which the Bush V

administration drew consistently upbeat
coverage for a successful military cam-
paign, the media climate has turned sharply
negative. Suddenly, the issues of civilian
casualties, military mistakes and the

Pentagon’s own credibility have been

dragged into the national spotlight.

HOUSTON — As the trial of Andrea
Pia Yates got under way Monday, the jury
listened to a detailed re-creation of June 20,
2001. That was the morning Yates fed her
children a breakfast of dried cereal and then
killed them, one by one.

Prosecutors say she wrapped the bod-
ies in a bedsheet, phoned her husband and
said: “I ﬁnally did it.”

In court Monday, she murmured “not
guilty” so softly that Judge Belinda Hill
asked her to repeat the plea

Ford rides see-saw of Mississippi life

“Her dying words were: ‘Oh, Richard,
for God’s sake, would you stop  me
so many questions?” _

Ford kept the tone light throughout the
speech, entertaining the half—ﬁ_l1ed
Carnegie Music Hall audience with his wit
and charm. He talked about being dyslexic
as a young boy from Mississippi and his
acceptance to Michigan State as a “region-
al condiment,” a white man from the South
among the multitudes of Midwestem farm-
ers, inner city blacks and East Coast immi-

I grants.

are so many writers from Mississippi, cit-
ing Pitt’s Lewis Nordan as an example.

Staying humorous about the nature of
his birthplace, Ford said that he was not
sure that there were in fact more writers
from Mississippi than any other state, just
that it sometimes seemed that way. He said
that many Mississippi natives would
ascribe it to a tradition of storytelling. Ford
said he was‘ skeptical, though.

“Many Mississippians talk more than
anyone ever should be allowed to _legally
talk,” he said.

For the only time during the entire
evening, Ford turned somber, talking about
his native state’s struggles with racism,

writing tradition of Mississippi might be
born of a desire to make sense out of a dif-
ﬁcult past.

“We Mississippians have so much to

— Ford also described the “apartheid
society” of the South that “instilled a pro-
found sense of absurdity” in him, one of
the most powerful inﬂuences in his gravi-
tation toward writing as a career.
Ultimately, Ford could only say for certain
what had not prevented him from becom-

“Nobody ever came along and said,

ever said, ‘Ford, this isn’t for you.”’

Patriotic holidays University-style

“Closed in observance of Presidents
Day.”

It was a sign you probably saw often
Monday. If you tried to deposit a check,
called any government office or went to the
post oiﬁce, you were out of luck. In honor
of legendary presidents George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln, banks,
government offices and selected businesses
took the day off. ,

But no extra day did the national holi-
day apply to Pitt students.

Instead, students can console them-
selves with the knowledge that Pitt will
close in observance of Great Americans’
Day. ’

When is this day you ask?

It’s in March, the University responds,
conveniently scheduled for the Friday,
March 8. '

Wait, you respond, isn’t that the Friday

of spring break?

Why, yes. Yes, it is. So maybe you
won’t be consoling yourself with the alter-
native Pitt-designated holiday after all. It
may even have you wondering what exact-
ly Great Americans’ Day is.

If that’s your question, you might have
some trouble ﬁnding an answer. It’s not a
national holiday and it isn’t observed by
Carnegie Mellon, Penn State or the
Community College of Allegheny County.

' And the only Web sites that turn up on a

Google or Yahoo keyword search for
“Great Americans’ Day” are Pitt sites, pri-
marily academic calendars.

., So what is this Great Americans’ Day
all about? And why don’t we just have
good old Presidents Day oﬁ?

A little Web searching turns up a
University Times article from January 8,
1998; the “holiday” apparently used topbe
observed in February, but University policy

moved it to March. According to the article, ‘

the idea was to designate a day on which
students would already be away, thus mak-
ing it unnecessary to cancel a week’s worth
of Friday ‘classes.

This rationale might just have you
wondering what kind of holiday Great
Americans’ Day is. It’s a moveable holiday
designated by the University to be observed
on a day‘ we’re already not having classes.

Why bother?

There seems to be some shady logic
going on here. Rather than observe a patri-
otic holiday designated by the federal gov-
ernment ——- Presidents Day ' —— the
University picked its own day to close
while students are already away. Why
doesn’t the University just admit it doesn’t
want to give us another day off? Or if it’s a
problem to give us a second holiday on a
Monday during the spring semester, since
we already have Martin Luther King Jr.
Day off, why not pick another day — say,
a Friday? , .

But if the University is truly attempting
to commemorate our nation’s past — as the
name Great Americans’ Day would imply
— why not just observe the time—honored
Presidents Day? S -

I Lessons from the real
‘Black HawkDown’

Mark Bowden’s “Black Hawk the number was between 10,000 and

Down,” published as a serial in the

 

early 1998, is no Homeric
tale of martial glory and
heroism. In fine detail it
relates the story of a bat-
tle near the Olympic
Hotel in Mogadishu,
Somalia, on Oct. 3, 1993.
It is a story of mass con-
fusion, gross incompe-

the Canadians have
become the most notori-

and sheer mortalterror. ‘

In short, it is a story of actual
warfare, and the recent attempt to
turn Bowden’s scrupulously
researched tale of murderous chaos
into a cinematic-morality play about
patriotic redemption is at best mild-
ly offensive. ‘

' We would do well to draw the
appropriate lessons from the experi-
ence of Somalia, though these are
not necessarily the lessons Bowden
himself —— much less the Hollywood
version of Bowden — would have us
draw. There is a reason why Somalis
regarded U.S. troops withsuch vio-
lent hostility on that day, even

though they had welcomed the

entrance into their country of U.S.-
led U.N. forces onlymonths earlier.

In December of 1992 U.N mili-
tary forces entered Somalia ostensi-
bly tofacilitate famine relief. While
the‘ United States quickly claimed
that the operation saved 2 million
lives, the independent U.S. Refugee
Policy Group later determined that

_ tion is unfair because Canada was

the only country to mount a full
inquiry into charges of abuse by its
forces. The Belgians were especially
bad, engaging in sadism including
torture, sexual aggression and mur-

There were also documented
cases of brutality on the part of the
Tunisians, 4 French,

trast, Ireland, Australia and
Botswana appear to have been spot-

U.S. forces were different from
the others in one respect: U.S. atroc-

The minimalist consumer: si

“Give it awlzy give it away give it away give it
away now. ” — Red Hot Chili Peppers (more than 2
million copies sold)

When the Greek minimalist philosopher
Diogenes saw a boy drinking water from cupped
hands, he threw, away his own cup. Maybe it’s
because I grew up in a crowded little
house, or because I have had to pack up
and move so many times, but I get great
satisfaction out of giving things away
that I’ve decided I don’t need. I like the
liberated, almost spiritual feeling I get
when I unburden myself of some mater-
ial possession. But there is no denying
another fact: I like buying new things.

These competing urges do battle for
my soul. Into one ear the demon of
acquisition yells “Buy it!” while in the ’

    

Robert Ali

Columnist

In this light, I have discovered an environmen-
tal and ethical rationale for material simplicity. My
quest to “live simply” can now also be about sus-

. tainability and equity, “so that others may simply

live.” Whether it’s a greener supplier of electricity
or a more energy-efficient means of transportation,
I am increasingly willing to pay extra not only for

portability and convenience but also for

an easing of my environmental con-
science.

Against the tide of our ever-
increasing national appetite for things,
there is also a discemibly growing cur-

movement towards “voluntary simplici-
ty” and a less materially-oriented set of
values. Many people are beginning to

around the pursuit of bigger cars and

other the angel of divestiture whispers
“Get rid of it!”. In our society of planned obsoles-
cence the seductive genius of advertising has
always appealed to both of these impulses, com—»
bining their voices into one stereophonic battle cry
of consumption, “Get rid of that, yes indeedy! And
buy this to replace it!”

American businesses also discovered long ago
that there is a market for simplicity. It is a great
commodity to travel light, to live light. People not
only want to feel thin, free and streamlined but they
are also willing to pay for these feelings. Some
items on the market, like ultra-light camping gear,
global positioning systems or handheld internet
gizmos can even bestow on me the savage exhila-
ration of an ultra-modern primitive. I am suddenly
a hunter-gatherer again, powered by my credit card.

And so my ongoing efforts to keep my stuff to
a minimum have so far only succeeded in prev_ent-
ing a deeply ingrained tendency to accumulate
from taking over completely. Yes, I have given a lot
of junk to Goodwill, but all too often I have
replaced it with new junk from Wal-Mart.

America is the great consumer society. We
make up less than five percent of the total popula-
tion of the world, but we consume 25‘ percent of the
world’s resources. Most agree that the resources of
the earth would be quickly exhausted if everyone in
the world lived the consumptive lifestyle we do in
America. We can’t go on like this, right?

bigger houses. A number of highly suc-
cessful individuals now describe themselves _as
“downwardly mobile,” some even choosing to be
“independently poor” ‘in pursuit of more meaning-
ful lives. .

How much is enough? How much should we
have and use so that the earth could sustain it if

everyone acted as we did? How much money does _

a person really need in this country?

There have been a variety of answers to these
questions. For example, beginning in 1977, Charles
Barber of Seattle lived for many years on what he
called the World Equity Budget (under $150 per
month, based on an equal distribution of the.
world’s income). Ralph Nader, though a million-
aire, restricts himself to an annual living budget of
$25,000; Publications such as “Your Money or
Your Life” tell us how to live comfortably on a
monthly income ranging from $600 to $2000.

Like any desire not based on pure physical

need, it can be argued that the desire for simplicity

by members‘ of a society like ours is somewhat con-
trived. Itis certainly true that, unlike the billions in

this world who live in true poverty, those of us in‘

America who want to scale down economically
have the luxury of deciding on our own. Still, we
might do well to start thinking about it. _

ing.net. There are many excellent books available
on the subject, too, but I’m afraid that if I‘listed

But, in February of 1993, U.S. and
Belgian troops allowed the capture
of the town of Kismayo by Gen.
Mohamed Hersi Morgan, a loyal fol-
lower of the deposed tyrant
Muhammad Siad Barre. Because
Aidid’s followers had been instru-

mental in overthrowing the hated

‘\’."“:.

policy set the stage for Mogadishu battle

Barre, the incident set the -Habr Gidr
on a collision course with the United
States.

On June 5, Aidid’s troops killed
23 Pakistani U.N. soldiers in an
ambush," sparking a‘ manhunt for
Aidid. Over the course of the follow-
ing months, U.S. forcesiin particular
were responsible for serious breach-
esof the Geneva Conventions —— in
other words, war crimes.

Because U.S. commanders_want-
ed as few American casualties as
possible, they used aerial bombard-
ment and overwhelming firepower to
thedetriment of the civilian popula-
tion. On June 17, acting on a rumor

that Aidid was hiding out in Digfer
Hospital, U.S. helicopters shelled
the hospital. They . caused an
unknown number of casualties.
Then on July 12, U.S. heli-
copters fired ten rockets into a build-
ing where civilian leaders of the
Habr Gidr were meeting’ «in an
attempt to find a solution to the cri-
sis. At least fifty-four people were
killed. ' I
It was because of incidents such
as these that the civilian population
of Mogadishu came to hate U.S.
troops, and the stage was set for the
Oct. 3 battle when U.S. forces

attempted to arrest several of Aidid’s

aides. This is where Bowden’s

account of the events picks up, and
he includes plenty ofstories about

soldiers trying not to endanger civil—  0‘
ians, but also plenty of cases where

U.S. soldiers fired indiscriminately

into crowds of people. In the end, 18 '

U.S. soldiers and perhaps ' 500
Somalis — most of them civilians —
lay dead.

That’s hardly ‘a record to be '
proud of, though some seemto think ’, -

it’s Oscar material.

NCAA games

  

“SPORTS VIEW

Kenneth Paul

Well, boys, it’s up to you, Mark
Nordenberg and Steve Pederson ‘to show
your Pitt pride and allow students to
embrace the school spirit available for

consumption in less than a month.

On March 11, the NCAA will
announce what basketball teams will
make the NCAA Tournament and where
they will play.

Soon after, the Pitt Panthers and 63
other teams will vie for the national
championship. But unlike bowl games
and other major sporting events, the
NCAA doesn’t let the madness wait until
the weekend or even until the sun goes
down. ‘

NCAA tournament games are played.

during the week, while professionals and
students who have the will to defeat the
snooze button are doing their thing at
work or in class. .

This presents a problem.

Pederson worked from day one to
create an atmosphere for winning pro-
grams, or at least two programs: football
and basketball. And as everyone knows,
along with winning comes excitement
and pride.

He changed the school colors. _

He has replaced two long-standing
venues and replaced them with fancier

A structures. (Note: One does not have to

say “state-of-the-art,” “new” will work
just ﬁne).

Along with all of these changes, we
have also been blessed with a statue of
our Panther. This statue has really been a
big boost to the morale on campus. There
are constantly kids climbing on it for pic-
tures and all the students just can’t get
enough of it.

Pitt hits on just
12 of 51 shots in
loss to ranked BC

JOE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

In college basketball, it is diffi-
cult to win games on the road, in front
of another team’s home crowd, espe-
cially when that team is ranked.

It is even ‘harder to win when the
road team shoots less than 24 percent
from the field and is out-rebounded
by 22.

Unfortunately for Pitt, both of
those things happened last Saturday
against No. 21 Boston College. The
Panthers made just 12 of 51 shots and
were out-rebounded 48-26, falling to
the Eagles for the second time this
season, 64-37.

The Panthers’ point total was
their lowest of the season and Pitt’s
lowest since a 38-33 loss at St. John’s
on Jan. 27, 2001. . S

The loss was Pitt7s ninth in its last
10 games. The Panthers dropped to 7-
17 overall and 2-11 -in the Big East,
while the Eagles improved 19-5 over-
all and 10-3 in the conference.

Softball team gets off to tough start

DAN SIGNS
Staff Writer

The Pitt softball team opened its 2002 season this weekend in
the Campbell/Cartier Classic in San Diego.
' Playing ﬁve games in three days, three of which were against

' teams ranked in the top 20 nationally, Pitt left California with an 0-

5 record.

Sacramento State 9, Pitt 4 ~

Pitt started the Classic with a 9-4 loss to Sacramento State on
Friday aftemoon.

-After holding Pitt scoreless in the ﬁrst two innings, the
Hornets jumped on the scoreboard with two unearned runs in the
bottom of the second. ,

A Sacramento State single and double, an error by Pitt catch-
er Tiﬁany White and a wild pitch by pitcher Nikki Gasti allowed
the Hornets to push tworuns across the plate.

Pitt knotted the score in the next half inning.

The rally started with a walk by sophomore Beth Gill fol-
lowed by a single from junior shortstop Ana Velazquez. After a
sacriﬁce bunt by outﬁelder Missy Smith, ﬁrst baseman Kate

‘#709105!

#440-

Mitchell ripped a two-run double.

Pitt grabbed the lead with a run in the top of the sixth inning.

Singles by Smith, Mitchell and third baseman Kelly Hulpa
loaded’ th6 bases with one out. White then drew a walk to force
across a run. The Panthers were unable to get another hit, and left
the bases loaded, which proved to be costly for the Panthers.

The lead was short-lived as Sacramento State broke the game

I open with seven runs in the bottom of the sixth. Four hits, coupled

with two Panther errors, led to ﬁve runs for the Hornets, all of
which were unearned.

Pitt drew to within ﬁve in its last at-bat as a single by Mitchell
scored Velazquez. . .

Velazquez ﬁnished the game with two hits and two runs
scored from the leadoff spot.

Gasti gave up six hits in 5.2 innings. She allowed only three
earned runs, while walking four and striking out three.

“That was a team that we could’ve beaten but we made too
many mistakes,” Pitt head coach Michelle Phalen said. “I don’t
know if it was because of ﬁrst game jitters.”

N0 sophomore jinx for Pitt wrestling is Lininger

‘ JASON BARRANTI
Staff Writer

Jacob Lininger’s young career is quickly
making its mark in the record books of Pitt’s
wrestling team. The heavyweight is now ranked
11th for most all-time pins and eighth for most
wins as a sophomore. But for Lininger, his
career highlights have not yet occurred.

“It’s gonna be an All-American, and eventu-
ally a National Championship,” Lininger said.

Lininger’s relentless attitude towards win-
ning has led him to a ‘record of 30-9. As one of
the lightest heavyweights in the country, weigh-
ing in at approximately 220 pounds, Lininger has
thus far earned an honorable mention "for the top
20 in the heavyweight division.

.Lininger placed second in the state champi-
onships his senior year at Lower Dauphin High
School near Hershey, Pa. He was recruited by
Pitt and Penn State for wrestling. He eventually
chose Pitt because it gave him the opportunity to
both wrestle and play football —— his first love.

“I came out here and tried to do both my
freshman year,” Lininger said. “I red-shirted in
football and then I wrestled, but it gets to be too
much at this level. If you wanna begood, you
have to commit to one sport.” ’

Now concentrating solely on wrestling,
Lininger is working his way towards his goals.
According to head coach Rande Stottlemeyer‘, he

is a different wrestler than when he first came to

Pitt.

“Jake has really grown up in the last two
years,” Stottlemeyer said. “He’s a lot more
coachable. He’s done-a very, very good job for

99

US.

And hininger has great respect for his coach

6 as well.

“Coach has been great this year,” Lininger
said. “He’s got a great attitude with us, and it’s
keeping everybody real positive.”

During the off-season,
Stottlemeyer will take on the decision whether to
move Lininger to the 197—pound weight class.
Lininger would like to get down to that weight,
but Stottlemeyer isn’t yet in 100 percent agree-

' ment. 6

“He’s really been working hard at outwork-

ing the heavyweights,” Stottlemeyer said. “He’s '

learned to wrestle and win like a heavyweight.”

' Working hard at practice has helped Lininger I

improve tremendously. Each practice lasts a hour
and a half. Lininger and his teammates work at

drills, conditioning, and practice matches. The

Panthers practice twice a-day — an evening
workout, and one workout early in the morning.

“It really sucks getting up at six o’clock in
the morning [and] driving up the hill,” Lininger
said about early practices. “It’s just pitch black,
no cars on the road. But it’s all worth it in the
end —— it’s what we’ve been working for all
year.” _ \
Lininger’s hard work has paid off. He has
focused his skills in the heavyweight division.
Heavyweights range in weight up to 285 pounds.
Lininger has learned to wrestle different body
styles in the weight class — an aspect that has
made his sophomore year his best thus far.

And as a sophomore Liningeris still learning

as-each match passes and the competition gets’
tougher. He has lost two consecutive matches.

against some of the best wrestlers in his weight
class.

Pitt rugger getting ready for spring

MIKE MASLANIK
Staff Writer

Rugby has never enjoyed the pop-
ularity and prestige in the United
States that it has in much of the
world, but don’t tell that to the mem-
bers of Pitt’s Rugby Football Club.

Throughout its 20 year history,
the Pitt Rugby Football Club has
boasted several playoff appearances

and at one point was ranked as a‘

Division I team.

All—Americans like Brian
Stevenson have represented the Pitt
ruggers as well as Brian Vahosky,
who was a U.S. Eagle on the United
States’ national team. To produce
such solid players is even more
impressive considering the team
doesn’t have a proper practice field,
plays games five miles off campus
and has no weight room time. Not to
mention a scant a scant budget of
$2,500. I
A tightly knit unit, members of
the rugby team are fiercely dedicated
to their sport. Passion is a prerequi-
site for a game that is played almost
nonstop and without pads. Practices
for the spring season take place on
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays
behind the Cathedral of Learning
from 4 to 6 p.m.

“We’re always in
need of people to
play,” Pitt head coach
Dan Talbert said. “No
experience is necessary
as most of the players
came "with no real
working knowledge of
the game. That’s why
we have coaches.”

“We’re always
in need

to play.”

Another Pitt rugby staple is the

“Everywhere we go, there’s fun,”
senior Matt Hugus said.

Every sport has its "traditions.
When a hockey player scores his first
goal, his teammages normally present
him with the puck. Rugby’s first-

This involves the scoring player

the winning season, the men’s team is
enjoying an increase in participation
as 30 to 40 new players joined the
team since last semester.

This Saturday, the men’s team
opens up against Franciscan, a school
near Youngstown, Ohio.

The Pittsburgh Angels, headed by
coach Marc Ware, finished the season
with a solid .500 record, chalking up
a significant victory against WVU.

The Angels also won "the Rugby
Fights Cancer Tournament, played
last year at Boyce Park in
Monroeville. Like the men’s team,
the Angels’ roster is being boosted.
Thanks to their good record and
growing numbers, the Angels are con-

Softball team struggles in California

Softball, page 15

Paciﬁc 11, Pitt 1

Pitt went up‘ against a powerful offen-
sive team in Paciﬁc University Friday
night, and fell by a score of 11-1 in ﬁve
innings. A 
Nationally ranked No. 19 Paciﬁc got
all it wo11ld need in the ﬁrst inning when it
roughed up starting pitcher Gina Bessolo
for three runs. .

Unfortunately for Pitt, Paciﬁc wasn’t
content with its first inning production. It
pounded out 12 hits, oﬁ Panther pitching en
route to its 11 run outburst. V

Bessolo allowed four hits and seven
runs, four of which’ were earned. In just
over two innings, she walked three and
struck out two. I 1

Bessolo was replaced by junior Janelle

A Pepe. In three innings, Pepe allowed eight

hits and surrendered four earned runs. ' - 
Pitt’s only run-carne in the_._bottorn of

the ﬁrst inning whenl\IIitchell"hiti.h}er;.ﬁrst‘;_

homenm of the season. Thesolo shot was .
MitcheH’s ninth of ‘her career, ‘tying 'her'for'

second in Pitt history. _ , , _ _
Pitt’s only other hit in the” game -came
from Velazquez. ’ ‘ . -

Cal State-Northridge 5, Pitt 49 .

Once again, Pitt fell behind early, giv-
ing up three runs in the ﬁrst inning to Cal
State-Northridge on Saturday afternoon.
Pitt fought back, but lost by a score of 5-4.

“We’re not as sharp as we need to be,”
Phalen said. “We have several players
playing in their ﬁrst games and we really
haven’t established a comfort zone with
positions.” . .

The Matadors climbed on top in the
bottom of the ﬁrst inning, with three runs

' off Gasti.

Pitt clawed back to tie the score in the
top of the third. Hulpa smacked a two-run
homerun and Mitchell added a sacriﬁce ﬂy
for her ﬁfth I'l1Il batted in ‘of the young sea-
son. .

Cal State Northridge moved back into
the lead, tacking on runs in the third and

fourth innings.

-The score remained 5-3 until the sev-
enﬂi inning, when a late Pitt rally fell short.
Velazquez drove in Gill to draw the
Panthers within one, but they were unable
to get the tying run across the plate.

Gill ﬁnished the game with three hits
and two stolen bases. Gasti worked all six
innings on the mound for the Panthers, giv-
ing up eight hits and ﬁve. runs, two of
which were earned. She walked two and

' struck out ﬁve.

  Cal State-Fullerton 3, Pitt 0  

Pitt fell to 0-4 on the season after a 3-0
setback to No. 1'0-ranked Cal State-
Fullerton Saturday night.

Pitt continued its_ trend of falling
behind early when Titan Monica Lucatero
homered off Bessolo.

Cal State-Fullerton added a 11111 in the

Pitt’s Kate Mitchell provided Pitt’s only offense against Paciﬁc, with her ninth
career homenm, which puts her at second on the all-time list at Pitt.

third on an RBI single by Lucatero.‘

Pitt got its ﬁrst hit of the game on an
inﬁeld single by 'Mitchell in the fourth
inning. After a ﬁelder’s choice, freshman

Casey Pickard singled to left. (‘With two

outs senior Amy Steich struck out, strand-
ing runners at second and third. -

The Titans tacked on anotherrun in the
top of the sixth, with a triple by Amanda
Hockett, who later scoredgon a groundout

Cal State-Fullerton starter Gina Oaks
allowed just three hits, two of which were
by Pickard, in seven innings of work She
struck out 12 Panthers. .

. Bessolo also went all seven innings,
surrendering eight hits and two earned
runs, while striking out nine Titans. The
nine strikeouts were one shy of her career-
high, set in 1999 against Youngstown State.

Michigan 9, Pitt 0
Pitt wrapped up its California road trip

with its second straight scoreless eifort, los- '

ing 9-0 to ' No. 11-ranked Michigan on
Sunday afternoon.
Pittwas only able to muster one hit off

~ Michigan starter Marissa Young.‘ The lone

hit came ‘via a single by Gill in the third

I

inning. Gill then stole second and third
base before being left stranded.

,- Young struck out nine batters in four
innings on the mound. Meghan Ritter
closed out the game for the Wolverines,
throwing a scoreless ﬁfth inning and regis-
tering one strikeout. , '

Pepe started the game on the mound
for Pitt, allowing six hits and three runs,
two earned, in three innings. .

Gasti came on in relief of Pepe and
was hit hard by the Wolverines. She
allowed nine hits and six earned runs in 1.2
innings. 1
The 15 hits by Michigan was a season-

. high for a Panther opponent.

“We played very poorly against
Michigan,” Phalen said. “I think that all it
took was that they knew they were playing
Michigan and they let them have the game
but they realized that they could play with
Michigan. The next time around, Michigan
will see a different team.” ‘

The Panthers will see Michigan again
as well as four other teams as it returns to
the diamond Mar. 2-5, at the Plant City
Strawberry Fest Tournament in Plant City,
Fla.

 

Nobody gives a
crap about the

Panther statue
Paul, page 15

gives a crap about a statue.

I haven’t seen one student get their
Pitt rocks off on it because neither a stat-
ue nor a new color nor a new stadium to
house corporate snot-noses could bring a
campus together. _The statue is nothing
more than empty, forced pride.

Creating unity and excitement builds
pride, not shallow symbols.

And that is why I plead with our
chancellor, the man who can single—hand—
edly become an icon to every student, to
cancel classes the day that Pitt plays in
the tourney. '

One reason to delete classes for the
day is because nobody will go on that day

anyway. The tournament is a phenome- ‘

non that hasn’t included Pitt in close to a
decade and the blue—collar style of this
team has really stirred some chatter and
swagger throughout the campus.

But the real reason to cancel classes
is because it is an opportunity to bring the
whole campus together, for one reason
and one reason only -—— to root for our
Panthers. ' ‘ ‘

There is a ﬁeld house on the hill that

— I’m guessing thousands of Pitt students,

young and old, would love to pack to
watch the garne(s) on a Jumbotron. If for
some odd reason that plan isn’t feasible,
which I highly doubt, assuming there’s
nice weather, students could unite on the
Cathedral lawn to watch the action.

The athletic department paraded out ,

several large screens to promote football
season tickets earlier this season. There is
no reason that those screens could not be
dragged onto the Cathedral lawn, so stu-
dents could gather.

This is an opportunity "to put this
campus into a frenzy.

_ Even if the tourney is in the ‘Burgh,
most students will be unable to attend
because the tickets will need to go to the
real fans, like corporate customers.

Pitt officials need to take advantage
of this opportunity.

It’s not called March Madness for
nothing. The great thing is that it’s not
idealistic to think that this campus’ stu-
dents and its buildings could be covered
with Pittparaphemalia.

This is a chance to make things right.
This is a chance to give students a real
college experience to remember for the
rest of their lives. -

Make it happen and they will come.
Fail to be innovative and all you will have
is a statue.

Kenneth Paul is the sports editor of The
Pitt News and if this happens, he would
not ask for any of the credit from the
athletic department marketing gurus.
