_ The pursuit of a peaceful mind, body and
spirit drew a small crowd of students to the
William Pitt Union Ballroom Wednesday
night to experience the holistic Chinese exer-
cise Falun Dafa. ' ,

Pitt Program Council sponsored the intro— _
duction to the exercise, ‘which is said to reju-
venate a person’sentire body from muscle to
soul. Program Council Leisure and Learning
Director Jessy Pierce said ‘shewanted to hold
the event because she felt that it coincided
with the growing interest in meditation and
relaxation exercises such’ as yoga. _ -

Based on the principals of truthfulness,
compassion and forbearance, Falun Dafa
claims to lead to self—discovery while awaken-
ing the mind and senses.

Entering the ballroom, the students saw
the instructor, Jian Zhang, meditating in a cor-

ner before he began.’ V . . j

SGB fair briefs Pitt

students on politics

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

Student Government Board wants students to care.
That’s why its members have a huge box of voter registra-
tion forms to give out. i

It’s also the reason the board held a political awareness
fair yesterday from noon to 4 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union. A

,“The main purpose of this event is to address the apa-

- thy on campus by addressing issues,” said Rogette Harris,

chair of SGB’s Governmental Relations Committee.

Rainbow Alliance and the Campus Women’s
Organization had tables at the event.

“We’re just trying to educate people about queer
issues,” said SGB member Kerianne Ludwig. Ludwig, who
is also the office administrator for Rainbow Alliance, sat
behind a table cov_ered with the trademark rainbow-colored
banner, with handouts and a giant jar of free condoms,
which she said were a mainstay of Rainbow Alliance activ-
ities. P v P’ A

Pitt professor T horeauly examines literary puns

CHRISTINE CLAUS
For The Pitt News

Michael West knows that there are more than ’ ‘

200 puns in Henry David Thoreau’s'“Walden.”
And averaging one pun per page, that’s some
Walden to Walden punning.

West, a professor, scholar and author, was
awarded Phi Beta Kappa’s Christian Gauss
Award for literacy scholarship and criticism on
behalf of “Transcendental Wordplay,” his book
on the usage of words and puns in 19th century
American literature.

“I have great satisfaction because PBK is an
organization that I particularly respect. It’s high-
ly selective on Pitt’s campus,” West said.

West received the award and a $2,500 prize
in Williamsburg, W.Va., on Dec. 7.

West described “Transcendental Wordplay:
America’s Romantic Puhsters and the Search for
the Language of Nature” as a three-legged stool:
one leg rests on Thoreau and another on other
classic writers of the American Renaissance,

such as Washington Irving, Ralph Waldo,

Emerson, «Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman and
others.

The third, a wobbly leg, is planted in the sub-
soil of the mid-19th century when half-baked
linguistic theorists and educators urged students
to approach language quite differently than we
do today.

The descendents of these theorists and edu-
cators may still preside over modern classrooms
with the same dogmatic conviction of certainty,
according to West.

In the book, West discusses education in the
19th century and its implications- for literary
education today. He focuses on how foreign lan-
guage training was incorporated into 19th centu-
ry education. It implies that readers today could
benefit from such language training.

“In order to understand the literature of this
century, you must be able" to understand the lit-

Professor Michael West

erature of other eras of other countries and their
languages,” West said. - .
“To call a pun the lowest form of humor is a
striking claim and bizarrely incorrect,” West. told
the University Times. “
In his book, West dives into Thoreau’s

“Walden” and his use of satirical form. West

focuses on the "concept of Thoreau being a
humorist writer, not just a romantic nature
wﬁwn -

He described Thoreau’s style as “deliberate—

_ ly provocative.” . ~

“If I couldwrite one paragraph as good as a

"paragraph in ‘Walden,’ then I’d go to my grave
. happy,”’said West.

In the preface of “Transcendental Wordplay,”
West writes, “My hope is that this book can be
read with pleasure and profit /by people who
recoil from most academic literacy criticism. I
too mistrust it, rest assured. What I have to say
may interest ordinary readers amused by puns,
riddles, acrostics, anagrams, dirty jokes and
other forms of wordplay.” .

West said that his inspiration for writing
stems from “the desire to have fun, and,” he
added, “the desire to make money.” He suggest-

ed that “Transcendental Vl/\()rdplay” could\be‘

described as letting you know more than you
want to know. i I

‘‘I don’t mind being, at the center of contro-
versy as long as it’s a cause I believe in,” West
said. “I like argument. My writing sometimes
has a polemical slant. I hope to have the right to
say what I think.”

“I’m interested in humor in literature and, I
View Thoreau,’unlike many, as a notably humor-
ous, yet aggressive writer,” West said. “I think
he is the best classicist in’American literature;
provocative, contentious and shrewd.”

For the last 30 years, West taught at Pitt’s
English department. He is presently the chair-

’ man of the undergraduate awards committee.

West’s best advice tohis students is to “use

-your time in school to learn. Don’t neglect for-

eign languages, compete for prizes, don’t_be
afraid to subject yourself ‘to the test _of competi-
tion, read, widely, and above all, don’t "believe
everything your English teachers tell you.”

,, “Literature is like a snowball rolling down-
hill,” he added, “it never gets better it just gets
bigger. And, the same classics‘writers it started
with remain atithe core of it  Every age gets

the literature it deserves.” ’

NSBE helps students design futuristic space city

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

Students at Saint Benedict the
Moor Middle School are working to
design the first city in space with a
little help from the National Society
of Black Engineers. . .

For the third straight year, stu-
dents at Saint Benedict are compet-
ing for the Future Cities
Competition. They used the popular
computer program SimCity 3000 to
create their city, Cinderoc, and now
they’re preparing an essay on ener-
gy resources at use there. The stu-
dents will present the essay, along
with a scale model of Cinderoc, on
Jan. 26 at the regional finals of the
Future Cities Competition at _PNC
_Park.

Shanae Beauford, president of

NSBE, worked with St. Benedict’s
last year, where three presenters
wereregional finalists. This year,
the three previous presenters and a
support team of additional middle
school students meet regularly with
Beauford and other NSBE members
once a ,week to work on their city.
“What We’re trying to do is
teach them how things work when
you’re an engineer, and when
you’re an engineer, you have to
work in» teams,” Beauford said.
The students’ supervisor that
Beauford works with is Michael
Canton, an engineer who works for
Westinghouse and serves on the
steering committee of the Future
Cities Competition. He said that the
he tries to get as many participants
in the progra1_n-‘as he can, especially
younger ones. '

Fv

“We want to get more kids
involved, and we like to groom
them for future years,” Canton said.
“We pick up kids that we see com-
ing up in sixth or seventh grades
that are sharp and show a lot of cre-
ativity.”

Claudia Tipler is the faculty  

adviser of the students -at St.
Benedict’s. She said that the stu-
dents who get chosen for the com-
petition have to show interest and a
strong workethic.‘

“There are ,students;-whose tal-
ent and ability are selected special-
ly,” she said. “Some have good
research skills. Some - have good
computer skills. Some are good pre-
senters.”

Students V who - work with
Beauford -learn a variety of lessons
important to the field’, according to

vO\'.\'v-‘I

:~z.bJa:\A..u.A.tA

Tipler. ,.
.“They learn how valuable each

one of them is to the total project,”

Tipler said. “That’s the most impor-

_ tant lesson, that their individual tal-

ents come together.” 

'Supporting ‘ team member
Michael Davis, an eighth grader, is
currently" working on research for
the essay. He first got involved with
Future_Cities because of his interest

in computers. He said the most‘

valuable lesson was learning to
work with a team. I
“If I don’t get something. in,

‘maybe someone else will. We’re all

there for each other,” Davis” said.
“At first, we were kind of

U.S. ground forces kill, capture
Afghan fighters

KANDAHAR AIR BASE,
Afghanistan — U.S. special forces
killed at least 14 Afghan fighters
Thursday and captured 27 others in
the largest clash to date involving
American ground troops, U.S. offi-
cials said. .

One American was shot in the

A ankle in the fighting against Taliban

forces before dawn about 60 miles
north of Kandahar. '

Army officials at Kandahar air-'

port, the biggest concentration of

U.S. forces in the country,‘ did not '

disclose how many Americans took
part in the fighting or how long the
firefight lasted.

An official at the Pentagon said
the Special Operations forces had
traveled to a camp north of
Kandahar suspected of being ‘an al
Qacda outpost

 

Suleyman al—Faris and Abdul
Hamid. '

' When he was taken into custody
in Afghanistan, he identified him-
self to_ authorities as John Walker.
An FBI affidavit filed in the case
identifies him that way, and the
government, in its criminal com-
plaint, callcd him Walker. In. public
remarks about the case, Attorney

General John Ashcroft also ofteno

refers to him as Walker.
But on Thursday, his chief
defense attorney, J amcs J .
Brosnahan, sought to put an end to
the confusion. Hereafter, the lawyer
said, his client would be known as
John Lindh.

Minister Hamid Karzai won in

Chinese President Jiang Zcmin
made the promise of more aid in- a
meeting with Karzai, who ‘wrapped
up a two-day visit here that fol-
lowed his trip to Japan. At the
Tokyo conference," China had

. promised $1 million, as well as $3.6

million in humanitarian assistance.

It was not clear how the signifi-
cantly expanded . aid package,
reported by the official New China
News Agency, would be constituted
or delivered. _ '

As Karzai made a brisk climb
up the Great Wall outside Beijing,
he told reporters that his top priori-
tics in spending the aid money will
be “security, education, -health,
road-building.” , .

Afghan Reconstruction Minister V

Mohammed Amin Farhang said that
“the” international community did
its duty, and now it is our turn to do
what we have to do to use this
money efficiently.” '
‘ Farhang said he thinks that
China will resume projects it had
begun in Afghanistan but was
forced to halt during the more than
two dccadesof war in his nation.
“The Chinese have done a lot of
projects in Afghanistan,” he said. “I
hope that their help will be even
more in the future.”

PPC presents a novice’s
guide to banned Chinese
relaxation techniques

Falun Dafa, page 1

balance to maintain the body’s har— '

mony.

The group of students formed a
circle and followed Zhang’s instruc-
tions for the first exercise, _“A
Thousand Hands.” Starting with
their fingers close to their stomachs
in a circle, they raised their hands
above their heads and stretched

_ toward the ceiling.

Then they brought their hands
back toward their stomachs and
twisted toward the ceiling again.

Students repeated the moves
nine times while two other instruc—
tors walked around the room cor-
recting posture and arm positions.

Zhang instructed most of the
class with his eyes closed, looking
natural and relaxed compared to the
awkwardness of some of the new
Falun Dafa followers. Some stu-
dents did close their eyes while oth-
ers yawned and let their heads
droop. »

In the middle of the sitting exer-
cises a violin started playing in a
nearby room and Falun Dafa partic-
ipants could hear it clearly in the
quiet, calm room, but the lesson was
not disturbed. No one seemed to
notice the noise and no one looked
up from the exercise they were con-
centrating on.

Despite, the calming nature of
the exercises, the Falun Dafa trend
is not accepted everywhere‘, even in

' its home country.

Falun Dafa was introduced in
China in 1992, and in the first seven
years, it gained more than 100 mil-
lion followers, a number greater

. than the ‘number of members in the

Chinese Communist party.
The Chinese government found

' the quick paced following a threat,

although Falun Dafa has no political
or religious meanings. In 1998, the
Chinese president announced that he
wanted to “crack down” on the prac-

A tice of Falun Dafa.

According Emma Jin, who

taught the class alongside Zhang,

protesters were beaten, sent to labor
camps, tortured and killed. There
were more than 350 confirmed
deaths of Falun Dafa protesters and
the numbers continue to increase.
When Zhang was asked why the

"government was cracking down on

Falun Dafa, he.replied with a deep

breath and swing of his hand, “It is
stupid, really stupid,” but did not go
into_further detail. '

The negative vibe from the

Chinese government did not stop-the
exercise’s popularity, and Falun
Dafa continues to spread throughout
the world.

Some of the students in the class
plan to continue the exercises now
that they have been introduced. .

Sophomore Jillian Costigan read
books about meditation and relax-
ation, but never did any actual exer-
cises before. She said she enjoyed
the class and the way she felt after-
ward. I . '

“I feel great and relaxed. I have a
peace of mind I didn’t have when I
came here,” she said. ' V

Sophomore Hansen Brenkus
thought ‘that this was a perfect
opportunity to begin learning medi-
tation and relaxation techniques,
something that he has wanted to do
for a while. ' '

Brenkus
refreshed him.

“I only had three or four hours
of sleep and I was tired when I came
here, but I feel more awake and
relaxed now,” he said.

Keep the Oakland Zoo rocking

It’s been an exciting year in Panther
sports — and unlike many other years, it’s
January and the excitement is far from
gone.

and the excitement over Panther sports on
Pitt’s campus usually ends when the foot-
ball season does. But this year, the men’s
basketball tearn’s phenomenal play and
admittance into the elite top 25 rankings
has extended the fervor well into the sprin

semester. .

Going into Saturday’s game

Georgetown, the team is 17-3. This will be
the second Saturday in a row the team
plays Georgetown — last Saturday, it
defeated the Hoyas 68-67 on a buzzer-beat-
er shot from Jaron Brown at the MCI
Center. Let’s hope this week’s game isn’t_
so close.

Let’s hope it’s more like Tuesday
night’s game, in which the team beat
favored Syracuse by 15 points.

Brandin Knight, arguably the team’s
star, is playing injured right now. But the
guys did not let it get them down —
instead, they only stepped up their level of
play.

Many players, such as Brown, Julius

‘Page and Donatas Zavackas, have contin-

ued to play better each game, setting new
career highs each night. The team has
shown that it does not depend on only one
player for its success.

The excitement is spreading.
Saturday’s game at the Fitzgerald Field

Pittsburgh is normally a footballcity‘

House is already sold out and two members
of the Steelers even attended 'I‘uesday’s
game. Members of the Pittsburgh commu-
nity are showing up for games.

A It’s time for -everyone to get excited

-7 and get out there and support our Panthers.

Although Saturday’s game ' is sold out,
there are still many opportunities to see
them play. ‘ .

Thankfully, Fox Sports Net will broad-‘
cast the game against Georgetown, as well
as many others. The ‘Panthers play 70 miles
away, in Morgantown, W.Va., Feb. 16,
which spells a perfect opportunity for a

road trip. And tickets are still available for .

other home games.

This is the ﬁnal season in the Field
House, which is an enjoyable place to
watch basketball. Because it’s a small facil-
ity, you’re close to the action no, matter
where you sit. You’re also close to your fel-
low Pitt fans and 6,000 people cheering the
Panthers on to victory in a small Field
House makes it a loud —— and intimidat-
ing— place for opponents to play.

T-shirts being handed out at the game
proudly proclaim the Field House to be the
“Oakland Zoo” because of the fans. They
are exactly right. 4

But it cannot be the Oakland Zoo with-
out all of you, without people coming to the
games.

This team has big things in store for it.
Ir1 March comes the Big East tournament
— and then, we hope, the NCAA. Looks
like the fervor will go on even longer.

New commercials cast
  shame on fame

Television and crap will always be
synonymous. The current pile o’
garbage that irks me the
most is the crop of lame
commercials with bad
performances.
They quickly ruin the ‘comic
flow of the show I was
watching. The ‘following
examples are the best exam-
ples and are listed from
“bad” to “sucks the barna-
cles off a boat.”

In fact, maybe Garth could get

Don’t just pick and choose your religious beliefs

to a cup of tea.
Today’s , whimsical
approach to spirituality tells
' us that all religions are
equal, and it brings to mind
a now-cliched quotation
from Samuel Johnson: “He
who praises everyone prais-
es no one.” In other words, a
man may offer you a friend-
ly word, but that comment

 

risk-free view of our many
religious options is very
comforting, but it’s equally misleading.

Faith is an important issue, and it

loses its credibility when
you overhear him saying the
same thing to Charles Manson.

Johnson probably didn’t intend for .

the line to be applicable to our modern
view of faith, but it did work out that
way — he who praises all religions
praises none of them. .
Religions cannot all be equal. Mo

of them have unique rituals, doctrines
and beliefs that ﬂy in stark contrast to
the practices of other religions. No two
belief systems are the same.
Christianity, for example, teaches that
no man may enter heaven except
through faith in Jesus Christ. This fun-
damental doctrine is so radically differ-
ent from the polytheism of Hinduism
that the two cannot be considered equal-
ly true. They are not equal in any way

unless they are equal in complete and
total falsity.
Since people are very passionate

about their beliefs, conﬂicts often arise. _

That’s why we’re so ambitious in the
quest to keep our religions happy, uni-
form and faceless in every way, like a
line of tidy toy soldiers. Criticizing or
questioning someone’s faith is taboo
because it causes conﬂict, and conflict is
a more frightening enemy than igno-
rance. There is no open dialogue, and
the particularly ﬂimsy religions —
Scientology, I’mlooking in your direc-
tion -—- are given some undeserved
respect.

Considering you only have 70-
some—odd years on this planet, it seems

a bitridiculous to take the ideas and_

philosophies about what lies above and
play with them like inconsequential
children’s toys. At- the very least, reli-
gion deserves a deep and concentrated
evaluation. Eternity may depend on it.

Belief in God and ideas about heav-
en are rarely hot topics on college carn-
puses — especially when there are drug
laws to fight and machines to rage
against — but we may ﬁnd someday
that our faith is the most important issue
in our lives. Meanwhile, we do spiritual-
ity a terrible disservice by placing it on
the rack as a trivial preference or intel-
lectual taste.

We live in a time when right vs.
wrong and true.-vs. false are so blurred
that just about anything goes. This
ambiguity cannot apply to faith. To
assert that all religionsﬂare equal is to
brush them under the rug in hopes that
they will be forgotten. V

When your afterlife is on the line,

‘you realize that itdeserves some serious

attention. There is no middle ground, no
neutrality ' and no fence-walking.

’ Personally, reaching this point of spiri-

tual maturity has shown me that howev-
er religion may relate to me, it’s not my
cup of tea. .

Like many addictions, it started out
innocently enough, but soon became an
obsession.

I speak of “Pie Night,” a first-
semester institution that involved
watching a movie followed by a trip to
Eat ‘n Park. It started when two of my
friends and I decided to see a movie

because none of us had seen one in a .:>tm««r»

Pouruoi?

Leslie Hoffman

including three additional people. We
saw “Training Day.”
. Less thana week later, some Pie

    

Night members and company saw “The Others,” ﬁnishing the
night with a visit to our favorite Pittsburgh diner..For some rea-
son, we became obsessed with seeing every movie that came out,
followed by dessert.

After that, the pie and the movie became inseparable. Until
this semester, Pie Night happened at least twice a week The
three of us who started it can’t always go, but in order for it to be
a true Pie Night, at least two of us have to be the're. Pie Night

movie gatherings have ranged from just two of us to a dozen peo- F

ple. .

In addition to “Training Day” and “The Others,” Pie
Night—ers saw “Mulholland Dr.,” “Amelie,” “Life as a House,”
“The Man Who Wasn’t There” and “Vanilla Sky,” in addition to
some rentals — “The City of Lost Children” and “Boondock
Saints.” We viewed the rentals as sort of a supplement to our
ﬁlm-viewing.

We made sacriﬁces for Pie Night, too. - «

It’s not cheap to go to a movie, and then top it off with
dessert. And we went at least twice a week. Sometimes we did-
n’t go to bed until 3 a.m., and then we had to get up at 8 a.m. to
do our homework. It was tough, but we stuck together. We had
something good, and we were each deathly afraid that we would
skip a week and then never do it again.

Then we started skipping weeks.

It started with winter break. Each of us saw all the movies
we wanted to see as they came out, and some of us visited ‘more
exotic cities than Pittsburgh, and saw movies before they ﬁnally
reached our little city in January. '

One of the members of Pie Night also graduated last semes-
ter, and now has a lighter schedule than the two of us who are still
slaving away at school. And since we’ve retumed from our vaca-
tion, we still haven’t had a Pie Night. Well, at least not anything
that was ofﬁcially christened a Pie Night. ’ '

This lack of Pie Nights is depressing -—— and not because it
means we’re seeing fewer movies and consuming fewer calories
— but because Pie Night represented more than just consump-
tion. Pie Night was a time for friendship and lively discussion. At
Bat ‘n Park at 2 a.m., surrounded by our friends, chatting with the
stoned waitress, we felt drunk without having consumed even a
drop of liquor.

Pie Nights also represented something that we had a com-
mitment to. We were afraid that the event would become like a

resolution to exercise more; fun at ﬁrst, but easily set aside and '

forgotten when we stopped just once.

But all hope is not lost. Every Friday brings with it a new
weekend — 48 new hours to watch movies and eat dessert.
Perhaps this weekend brings a new Pie Night.

Got to get you into my life

I Am Sam  

Starring Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer
Directed by Jessie Nelson

<;‘n2r1/2 0 '

Sean Perm cuddles up to his movie d-aughter. Dakota Fa;n..ni”

“I Am Sam” has drawn criticism for being a heavy-
handed movie with a message that presents characters
‘who are stereotypically mentally handicapped. There is
no denying that it is a message movie,'but the depiction
of the mentally handicapped is anything but stereotypi-
cal. ‘

Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is a mentally challenged
father trying to raise his daughter, Lucy Diamond 
(Dakota Fanning), alone. To make things tougher, she is
beginning to surpass her father in intelligence and men-
tal capacity. Conﬂict arises when the state takes Lucy
away and challenges Sam’s parental abilities. In an
attempt to get her back, Sam hires a lawyer (Michelle
Pfeiffer) from the law firm with the biggest ad in the
Yellow Pages.

The message the movie successfully conveys is that
people who are mentally challenged have as much right
to be a parent as a‘ “normal” person. “I Am Sam” takes
this a bit further by underhandedly implying that Sam has
more of a right to be a parent because he is capable of
outwardly expressing love for his daughter, while ‘~‘nor-
mal” people are too wrapped up in their fast cars, high
paying jobs and cell phones to do so. This wasn’t the best
way to go about getting the messageacross, and hurts the
movie.

The Count of Monte Cristo
Starring Jim Caviezel, Guy
Pearce, Michael Wincott, Luis
Guzman and Richard Harris

Directed by, Kevin Reynold

The studio meeting for “The Count
of Monte Cristo” must have gone
something like this:

Blue-eyed Jim Caviezel as the hero
and Guy Pearce as the comic book
cheek-boned villain! A grizzled
Richard Harris as the old wise man!
Some nameless model as the teary—eyed
lost lover! Michael Wincott in a gravel-

elements for ' a big period
adventure/money-maker and every-
thing Hollywood is in its right formula-
ic place. 0 .

Alexandre Dumas’ novel “The
Count of Monte Cristo” is a classic tale
of betrayal and ultimate revenge, trac-
ing the fall of Edmund Dantes, a French
commoner betrayed by his supposed

friend, the Count Mondego. More than
a thousand pages long, “Cristo”
immerses» the reader in Dantes’ shat-
tered world, now engulfed in the desire
« for escape and revenge. But when he
begins to systematically exact it, the
reader is implicated just as Dantes is —-
should we root for a man whose life is
driven only by vengeance and murder?

With this new 2002 movie __adapta—
tion, an even bigger "question arises:

Why make the classic into a movie ‘

which shirks all those things that made
the book compelling? Because it could
be molded into the Hollywood formula,
that’s why. . . '

The result really is something you
can count on (“Count on revenge!”

pleads the tagline). “Monte Cristo”
isn’t inherently bad — even that would
make it memorable. But it is one of the

most unremarkable action-adventure"

films to come out in the last few years.
The swordﬁghts are fitting and every-
one ﬁts into their unmemorably script-

with glitter paint and bits of torn
feathers. .1 titled the masterpiece
“Rue Bourbon,” an homage to my
only memories of The Big Easy.

One of my friends painted a tiny
canvas a deep red and splattered
acrylic paints across it before attach-
ing a splash of synthetic feathers and
a pair of google eyes. At the end, she
proudly proclaimed that her piece
was an interpretation of .a parrot
who’d been hit by a bus.

Clearly, the feathers enthralled
us, because another friend took a
Polaroid photo of herself and painted
over it, also attaching feathers to its
surface.

According to Program Council
Arts Director Lisa Nguyen, the idea
was the brainchild of Leisure

Learning Director Jessy Pierce.
Nguyen said she had some space to
fill in the gallery between Jan. 22 and
Feb. 2, and when Pierce suggested a
self—directed exhibit, the idea took
off.

Nguyen estimates that\since its
Tuesday opening, more than 50 stu-
dents have taken advantage of this
free playtime. She said that student
work will hang in the gallery — com-
plete with a— small biography of each
artist — until Feb. 2, at which time
students will have a week to retrieve
their art.

In addition to the individual
pieces, students are encouraged to
contribute work to a large canvas
labeled, “Community Canvas.”

“I was hoping people would be
inspired to do a-little something that
had an impact,” Nguyen said.

’ Sam, page 12

The group of actors playing the
mentally handicapped is outstanding.
They never underplay their roles and
they never allow themselves to fall
into the stereotypically helpless and
hapless characterization many other
actors fall into.

This equally applies to Sean
Penn’s performance. Penn disappears
into the role of Sam, all the while
handling it with care. Penn portrays
Sam in a touching, sympathetic and,
most importantly, genuine manner.
One of the components to a success-
ful film that “I Am Sam” does have is
characters who seem like real people.

The Beatles also play an impor-
tant role in the film; the soundtrack
consists entirely of Beatles covers.

Sam is such an avid Beatles fanatic
and they play such a big role in his
life; for the soundtrackto have any
other music, would be unforgivable.

The Beatles play a more impor-
tant role, though. Throughout the
movie, Sam explains things to people
who don’t understand him by using
Beatles anecdotes and trivia. This is
initially a subtle touch that grows
throughout the movie. By the end, it
is used to such effectiveness that it
resonates with the audience as well,
even if we understand his ideas.

“I Am Sam” is a Hollywood'feel-
good movie, but it never becomes
overbearing with its agenda. The
story never becomes too “touchy-
feely,” and the audience still gen-
uinely cares at the end of the movie.
— Dante A. Ciampaglia, staﬁ writer

Count, page 12

ed roles, but this sort of thing has
been done to death —— this story
itself has been adapted 14 times,
not to mention the countless copy-
cats. Perhaps the film will strike a
national chord with the timely
yearning for revenge, but this is
still revenge the Hollywood way,
with little to no inner conﬂict or
unhappy ending. _

“ “The Count of Monte Cristo”
probably" does deserve an epic-
length interpretation, but today,
what’s the point? The ideas of
betrayal, revenge and redemption
are tired and timeworn. And even
if they weren’t, one would have to
do better than stringing decorated

» set pieces and swordﬁghts togeth-
er with the faint memory of a great
novel. But that’s all this version
does, making it a waste of every-
one’s time and money.

Staff Report

Someone is hungry for revenge.

Last Saturday, with six seconds
remaining on the clock, Jaron Brown
rebounded a shot from Brandin Knight
and sunk it into the net to secure the
Panthers’ 68-67 victory over the

, Georgetown Hoyas at the MCI Center in‘

Washington.

Tomorrow, the Hoyas will travel to

more forward Brown and sophomore
guard Julius Page achieved career highs
in the game, with Brown pulling down
10 rebounds and Page hitting 21 points.
Georgetown’s most recent game was

ranked ﬁfth in the Big East for scoring

A with 19.3 points per game, was the
Hoyas’ high scorer with 21 points.
Standout guard Kevin Braswell followed
with 14 points.

In the Pitt-Georgetown matchup last
week, the Hoyas dominated the ﬁrst half,
with their early lead peaking at 11 points.
The Panthers cut the Hoyas’ lead to three
by halftime’ and came back to‘ procure a
17-point lead with 8 minutes, 39 seconds
left, bringing the score to 62-45.

But with a series of‘ turnovers and
making 16 of 18 _ free throws,
Georgetown began to sneak up, with

- Drew Hall tying the game at 66 with 51
seconds remaining. The Hoyas took a
one-point lead when Ontario Lett of the
Panthers fouled out of the game nine
seconds later and Sweetney sunk one of
his two free throws.

, Knight,,with 11 seconds remaining,
took a shot from_ behind the arc. Brown

Indoor track working hard for future rewards

‘ SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

The Panther track team" is hitting
the weight room hardin the early
season, hoping that by paying the
price now, it’ll be rewarded with
national qualifications and league
championships later.

As a result, the Panthers only
brought home one first place from
the Pepsi Indoor Invite in
Blacksburg, Va. They also brought
home a national provisional-qualifi-
cation and they were near the top in
just about everything else.

That one first place didn’t come
on the track, though. It came from
Patrick Harding in the shot put.
Harding won the shot with a toss of
16.70 meters. 7 Teammate Mike
Stellefson was fourth at 15.30.

“That was a very good throw for
him,” said head coach Steve Lewis
of Harding, “but he hasn’t peaked
yet.”

_ Beth Rocks hasn’t peaked yet
either, but her times are already
close to surpassing her personal best
set last year when she was a provi-
sional qualifier in the half—mile.
Rocks finished a close fourth in the
half at Virginia Tech with a time of 2
minutes, 8.12 seconds, a provisional
time. Georgetown’s Jill Laurendeau
placed third, but had the same time
as Rocks. Unattached runners took
the top two spots.

“Right now, Beth is No. 2 in the
nation in the half,” Lewis said. V
“It was a couple 10ths of a sec-

ond off my best,” said Rocks, a

senior.

Teammate Janine ‘Jones finished
fifth behind Rocks (2110.68).

“Janine’s‘doing well,” Rocks
said. .“We’re both running fast.”

So far this season, Lewis has
been allowing men’s half-milers
Jesse Chalfant and J eryl Wilborn not
to worry about the 3,200 relay.

’ . “We had planned to run a real

2 (1252.56)

powerful [relay] this weekend but
those two have been running so well,
we allowed them to run individual-
ly,” Lewis said.

Wilborn finished 10th in the half
and Chalfant 12th
(1253.21). Both are close to provi-
sional times. 1

“Getting close,” Chalfant. said.
“Hopefully I’ll knock it out one of
these Penn State meets.” ,

Chalfant said the addition of the
freshman Wilborn to the team has
helped him tremendously. _

“My first twoyears here, I was
doing workouts by myself,” Chalfant

1 said. _“Now I get to run with him.

It’l1 help us both in the long run.”

Chalfont predicted the joint
workouts would help both individu-
ally and in the relay.

“I think if we put a team out
there, we can contest with any team
in the east and hopefully any team in
the country.” '

Mera Belisle, an All-American

who won the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference Championship
in the 400 last year, took eighth in
the event this weekend with a time
of 56.34. ECAC 500 champ Trenace

~E1liot finished two spots behind

Belisle in 10th (56.73).

. Kim Lyles was eighth in the 200
and 13th in the 60 dash. Amanda
Schmidt and Lauren Shaffer were
10th and 11th, respectively, in the
3,000. The 1,600 relay took third.

On the men’s side, Anthony
Pelham -and Maurice Patterson went
16th and 17th in the 400. Anthony

Fulton was 12th in the 600, and the ‘

1,600 relay tookfourth. ’ -

‘ The Panthers travel to the Penn
State National Open in‘ State College
this weekend and to_ a facility Lewis
holds in high regar .\ ‘

“It’s always exciting to go to that
other school in Pennsylvania,”
Lewis said. “They have the best
track facility in the country, proba-
bly the best in the world.” -

Manyteams will make

Should the New England Patriots
move forward with Tom Brady or Drew
Bledsoe in 2002?

Many teams will be faced with the
dilemma of which players and coaches
should be kept and which should be let

go.

interested in taking a player like Brady
to jump-start their franchise.

The Baltimore Ravens have
revealed that they intend on leaving
weak side linebacker Jamie Sharper
unprotected. The Ravens are $20.5 mil-
lion over the salary cap.

Some teams have started
to make moves. Some great
coaches have been let go, but
most teams will probably
begin to make their major
moves after the Rams beat
the Steelers in Super Bowl
XXXVI. »

Yeah Pittsburgh, I said

it! Spolrrs VIEW

The Patriots started out
0-2 under Bledsoe before
Bledsoe had to take a seat

 

Kevin Nash

Sharper would eliminate
$3.8 million of cap room,

but at what cost?
The trio of Ray Lewis,
Peter Boulware and

Sharper are the key to one
of the most dominant
defenses in the game.
Breaking up that trio
could be disastrous for the
Ravens. The Ravens cer-
tainly should not be in a
rebuilding mode, and this

due to an injury that caused
internal bleeding.

Brady, who was the 199th draft pick
overall in 2000 out of Michigan, has
resurrected the New England Patriots as
they clinched the AFC East this season
and will likely will end their season in
the AFC championship this Sunday.

The question is whom do you move
forward with? You have a Pro Bowl
quarterback who has been taking the
snaps fornine years" and led the Patriots
to the Super Bowl ﬁve years ago. Then
there is Brady, the second year man who
took the winless Patriots and proceeded
to go 13-3 including the playoffs. 3

It has been a great story to follow as

Brady has taken a team that until about.

week 11 not many ﬁgured would even
be in the playoffs and certainly not be in
the AFC Championship.

Brady showed a lot when he
brought his team back last Saturday

against the Raiders. Of course he ‘had
the help of the immaculate, incomple-
tion, but I would have to go back with
the proven starter. Drew Bledsoe should
be the quarterback in 2002.

For all we know, Brady’s play could A

be a ﬂuke. New England does not want
to be in a situation where they are kick-
ing themselves at the conclusion of next
season. A

There are many teams who would

love to have Bledsoe and besides, they’

just signed him to a 10-year extension in
March 2001.

It just wouldn’t make sense to have
somebody with a huge contract not
earning his paycheck. , ' .

With, the Houston Texans joining
the league, there are players who are not
going to be protected. Teams have to
‘place ﬁve players on the ‘unprotected
list, and this can be somewhat helpful to
teams that have salary cap issues.

The'Texans more than likely will be

will not be as dominant.

When defensive end Michael
McCrary went out for the season
because of knee surgery, Boulware had
to play a lot of defensive end. You could
see that Boulware was missed back at
his normal strong linebacker position.

Teams were gaining more rushing
yardage, not to mention the Ravens
gave up 100 yards rushing to Cincinnati
Bengals running back Corey Dillon for
the first time in 50 plus games. Part of
the problem was that the defensive line
was beat up, but there was deﬁnitely a
void among the linebackers.

- The Indianapolis. Colts have chosen
to go with former . Tampa Bay
Buccaneers head coach Tony Dungy
after the firing of Jim Mora. Dennis
Green was also let go by the Minnesota
Vikings. All of these coaches are great
coaches and should not have been fired.

Green led the Vikings to four NFC
Central titles and two NFC champi-
onship appearances. Green was dropped
after the Vikings had a 5-11 season. ‘

The Colts’ record dropped to 6-10
this past ‘ season and Mora was ﬁred
because he wanted to keep defensive
coordinator Vic Fangio. During"~Mora’s 1
tenure, the Colts won the AFC East once
and made two playoff appearances. The
Colts put Mora in a difﬁcult position
and you have to respect Mora for his
loyalty. v '

Dungy was ﬁred after a loss to the
Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card
round of the playoffs.

Dungy turned the franchise around
as he racked up the most wins as a head
coach in Buccaneers history. Tampa Bay

made it to the playoffs four out of six of . A

‘ ' Kari Williams took third with a per-

sonal best of 9.8.

Rutgers-’ highest finisher on the
day was Katie. Russo, who claimed
second on the balance beam with a
9.775 from the judges.

Despite finishingwith a team

total almost three points higher than
in their opening meet, the Panthers ..
a fall to‘ 1-2 on the season and 0-2 in

the East‘ Atlantic
League. V »

Hoyas looking for revenge

Basketball, page 15

Braswell, normally a force for
Georgetown and ranked third in all-time
scoring for the Hoyas behind Allen
Iverson and Eric Floyd, to just eight
points. '

The Panthers’ triumph vaulted the
team back to the No. 25 position in the
USA Today/ESPN college basketball
poll.

Tuesday’s victory over Syracuse
was less heart-stopping. Pitt outrebound-
ed the Orangemen 43-18 and was in the
lead consistently after a 5-4 Syracuse
advantage early in the ﬁrst half. In addi-
tion to Brown and Page’s peak perfor-
mances, Knight persevered through a
calf injury and tied his career-high for
assists with 11. .

Knight, the undisputed leader of th
Panthers, is averaging a team-high 14.9
points per game as well as 6.8 assists a
game, good for second in the Big East
behind Chris‘ Thomas of Notre Dame.

Donatas Zavackas and Page are also

factors for the Panthers in scoring, aver-
aging 11.7 and 10.6 points, respectively.
Brown is leading Pitt on the boards .with
6.1 rebounds per contest.

The Panthers will look to control
Sweetney, who is tops on the Hoyas with
19.3 points and 9.8 rebounds a game.
Georgetown has won the last four meet-
ings at the Field House and has an over-
all record of 11-7 there.

Conference matchups are always
crucial, but the Panthers have extra rea-
sons for wanting to pick up yet another
game on the Hoyas. ‘Pitt is playing for

positioning in the Big East Tournament 4

and looking for a ﬁrst—round bye, a lux-
ury given to the top two teams in each
division. The Panthers are currently sec-
ond behind only Syracuse while
Georgetown sits in third.

A crowd of 6,798 enthusiastic fans
packed the Field House for the Syracuse
game, and a similar crowd can be
expected at tomorrow’s game, as it is
also sold out. Tip-off is scheduled for 4
p.m.

 

W BRYANT/PHOVTO E01112

Sophomore Julius Page recorded a career-high 21 points in the Panthers’ upset
.. victory over Syracuse Tuesday night at the Field House.

franchise around and it goes unappreci-
ated. Before Dungy’s airival, Tampa
Bay was 43-111. These days it’s not
enough to make it to the playoffs. If you

'don’t win the Super Bowl in a short

amount of time, you are out. It is sad,
but that’s the way thing-s are. Look for
Indianapolis to turn things around in a
year or two.

i All of these coaches have the same
story. They have had great coaching

careers, but they didn’t make it to the‘

big game. Dungy has already been
picked up and I’m sure that there are
other teams who would love to have
Green and Mora.
