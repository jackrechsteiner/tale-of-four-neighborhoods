Pitt searches for Student Health director

ERIC SLAGLE

i Staff Writer

While in the midst of a search for a new full-
time director, Student Health Services will lose its

current interim director Donna Nativio by the end of ‘

this week. 4»

The organization expects to have the 
, position filled by January, Nativio said last

Thursday. For now, the name of her replacement
remains a question.
Vice Provost and Dean of Students Sharon

Johnson said that the interim position had been ’
made available to an individual who‘ is still consid-'

ering the offer. Nativio will continue her duties as

chairwoman of the Search committee, which‘

Johnson formed in July. " }  I "

Nativio said that sushas -been without as am-

time director for about three years. She took over as
interim director in May, replacing Paul Ferraro.
After spending the better part, of the summer
determining what qualifications the new director
should have and designing the advertisement, com-

mercial spots were placed in various health and edu-
cation journals,local newspapers and minority list-
ing services. ; - 7 , -
“We have the system in place. We"re waiting for
the applications to‘ come» in,” Nativio said.
Pitt. spokesman‘ Ken Service said the delay in
filling the position was because of personnel
’ changes in the student affairs department and a
-batch of unsatisfactory applicants when theposition

was advertised’ before 'Na’tivio’s arrivalwin the

department.   -p v i
According to_Nativio, the committee has

received about 10 applications so far with two inter-. Q
nal candidates from SHS. The application. deadline,-

is Oct. 13. -

SGB president Joan Snyder, who serves .as the
. student representative on the search, comfnittee; said
‘theﬁgro1'1P.,has been ‘:me'et_ing -for ToverTaI:mo’I1th",to.

review resumes and 'h‘ear°"suggestions. P_ri'oritie"s‘for‘
Snyder include ﬁnding ‘a director who is service-ori-_
ented, recognizes the special needs of a student pop-.

ulation ‘and keeps gynecological serviceswliigh on
the agenda. Thé"app1icant must also stay abreast of
trends in other universities’ health services.

"health care providers.

Snyder said that in a SGB survey conducted last
year, results showed that what students demanded
most were increased SHS hours.

“I think we need more direct interaction with
student government,” said Nativio, noting that a stu-
dent advising board could conduct surveys and offer
suggestions to help the new director improve ser-
vices. “It’s clear you can get a lot more done if you
are working together with students.” .

vThe..co,niinittee .is.a1so comprised of members
from the’“‘ofﬁces ‘of.th’e provost and vice provost,’the
school of medicine, the counseling ‘center and inter-
national services.  P y I J J .

N ativio saidthat a representative fromjthe coun-
seling center was selected’ for ~— the committee

because it was a branch‘ of student affairs and
[bee-ause_ medical and mental health issues-are fre-
-quenftly ‘linked. She “said that’ international- -services

The Pitt l\lews

While there were no clowns or ‘bal-
loons to greet fourth—year students who
visited Placement and Career Service’s
Senior Day yesterday, the point was
clear: The workers at. the Placement
and Career Services are willing to pay
seniors all the attention of a surprise
party. .
The department has many tools to
help students search for a career,
including the Pitt Pathway, a four-
stage path to employment.

The ﬁrst stage is designed to help
students assess different aspects of
themselves — their values, beliefs,
interests and ideals. An abilities work-
sheet helps students determine if they
are natural leaders, team players, plan-
ners or risk takers. Students can also

After this step, students will
receive a career notebook from the
advisers to help them through the
remaining stages.

The next stage helps students to
explore possible career options. One of
the features. offered here is “Alumnet,”

an online community -of . Pitt ' alumni ”
who will explore their career choices

with "Pitt students and ‘help .s_tude_nts

Nativio, who currently divides

her time between SHS and the school
of nursing where she is an associate
professor, said it is important for
SHS to ﬁnd a full-time director to
manage the 35-person staff and
added that the ideal candidate would
have a strong medical and adminis-
trative background.
SHS has a budget of approximately
$3.5 million, most of which Nativio
said comes from the $65 student
health fees.

The staff includes four physi-
cians, seven nurse practitioners,
three nurses, three pharmacists and

medical assistants. The office on the
fifth ﬂoor of the Medical Arts
Building at 3708 Fifth Ave. is open
from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Primary care for ailments such as
upset stomachs, colds and rashes,
and specialty services including der-
matology, gynecology.and on-site
orthopedics are covered by the health
fee. Pharmacy products, physical
examinations, X-rays and lab work
are available at an additional cost to
students. _ ,

SHS also provides educational
services to students for a variety of
health—related issues including‘ smok-
ing cessation, first aid, and nutrition
counseling.

Mass transit options for

the 21st century needed

Recently, Port Authority Transit
and several other transit interest
groups armounced a new study that
will look at mass transit options for
the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
This study, the ﬁrst since the 1960s,
will focus on such issues as expand-
ing currently existing systems,
including busways and the T, adding
new systems like river transit and

expanding mass transit to areas out- ‘

side Allegheny County.

Such a study is certainly neces-
sary and the following ideas should
be considered:

Any new mass transit options
should not rely on the road system.
Mass transit’s purpose is to decrease
trafﬁc and provide a convenient
alternative to driving. However,
buses (except those on busways) are
faced with the same delays as cars.
Also, they have the additional strain
of frequent stops, so taking the bus
can take more time than just driving.

The expansion of busways and
the T co11ld help alleviate that prob-
lern, as these options will not be con-
strained by traffic and make the com-
mute faster, thus increasing rider-
ship. This expansion should include
other areas of the region, such as
Oakland, to accommodate the large
student population (as many do not
have cars at their disposal) and
Pittsburgh International Airport.

In addition, the study should
consider new technology. The feder-
al government currently plans to
build a prototype magnetically levi-
tated high—speed train system in one
city; Pittsburgh is among the con-
tenders for this. If Pittsburgh is cho-
sen, the new system will connect
Downtown, the airport, Monroeville

' and Greensburg.

The three rivers. are also an
untapped resource for transportation,
and the study explores alternatives.
Investigating the feasibility of river"
transit is necessary, including high-
speed Hovercraft and river shuttles,
among other options. These could
turn the rivers from a transit impedi-
ment into a gold mine.

Although our taxes may
increase slightly as a result of mass
transit expansion, in the end this will
save money for everyone, for it may
not be as necessary to spend money
on such things as gas, parking and
auto insurance. Also, we would
avoid other problems such as spend-
ing time in traffic (time is money,
after all) and Pittsburgh would not
regain its stigma as the “Smoky
City.”

The willingness of people to use
mass transit is clearly evident; the
solution to lPittsburgh’s transporta-
tion woes lies in what the city does to
accommodate this desire. _

Freslnnen, beware!

Imagin_e it is the middle of the ﬁrst week of
your new college experience. "OK, it is the middle
of the ﬁrst week of your college experience. You
have gone to a few classes, explored the streets of
Oakland and even bought your ﬁrst textbooks.

Then it happens.

You’re probably walking to class or
hanging with your new roommates,
investigating all that Oakland has_to
offer. Most likely you’re outside and
walking down Forbes Avenue when
you hear a voice. It comes from the edge of the
sidewalk, pushed up against a storefront window.’
At ﬁrst you don’t even see the source among the
crowd of pedestrians. I

Then you hear the jingle of small pieces of
metal against the sides of a paper cup. The voice
says to you, “Man..you got any change?” Bingo,
your ﬁrst encounter with a panhandler.

Don’t be fooled. For some it is easy. The
answer is “no” because the book store wiped
them out.

For others it’s not so simple. You know
you’ve got change in your pocket and before you
is a man or woman beseeching you for help. Most
likely you’re from the suburbs and_ have never
seen a panhandler. He might tell you he is hungry
or she might say that her children need to eat

If you’re not completely hardened after your
ﬁrst three days of city living, which you probably
are not (I mean really, I’ve been at this urban col-

lege lifething for four years and I still feel for the

less fortunate -— we aren’t living in New York),
your heart goes out to him. So you reach in your
pocket and give him 50 cents, a dollar, $5, $10,
maybe even $20.

you’ve made the world a better place. You’ve
helped a fellow human being. Unfortunately

though, you’ll retum later that day only to ﬁnd the '

panhandler with his ﬁst clenching a bottle’

lege career continues you’ll ﬁnd him-there each
and every day asking you for a little more change.

Crazy adventures crack house restoration

I’m not one to give advice. Get drunk
in the morning, do lots of drugs and
scream obscenities at little boys and girls
as you speed down the freeway on a
motorcycle ‘wearing nothing but a top hat,
and you won’t hear so much as a peep
from me. .

But as a self-respect-
ing member of this colle-
giate community; I feel
compelled to warn you of
one trap you must avoid
falling into during your

DAVE

years at Pitt. Whatever you do, do not,

under any circumstances, buy a dilapidat-

- ed crack house in South Oakland and‘
« spend every waking hour of your spring

semester ﬁxing it up.-"Trust me, it’s a bad
idea. »
I I’m not sure. where the idea came
from, but in December of my,freshrnan
year, I spent every last dollar I had saved

for college on a vacant f1ve-bedroom/

house in South Oakland. Sure, it may
have been missing ceilings and walls, and
when it rained water found its way down

through each of the three ﬂoors, but it was ,

a house. It was my house. i .
The plan was simple: I’d tear every-

 thing out, rebuild and renovate every
room and then live there while I rented it
out to pay for college. Never mind the fact I

that I didn’t know a thing about home
repair; I could learn that stuff from books.
Never mind the fact that I was taking 18
credits that spring; college is full of free
time. I could fix the house up on the week-
ends.

By February, it was blatantly evident

’ that I was done having fun for the rest of

the semester. 

By‘ March, I was ﬁnished sleeping,
studying and spending time with anyone
other than roofers and plumbers. Not that
plumbers aren’t good people, but you can
only swap drain—clog stories so many
times before it becomes tiresome.

‘ Throughout the entire semester, my

home renovations proved all-consuming.

While most Pitt students were learning the
78 and outs of downtown Pittsburgh, I
was struggling with the ins and outs of
electrical wiring. Instead of tapping kegs,
I was running water supply lines. My
“spring break” was spent unclogging a
sewer line in my basement. And on Easter
morning I could be found installing a toi-
let in my bathroom.
I So basically I was having a blast.
Aside from destroying any chance I

had of having fun my ﬁeshman year at I

college, my home renovations also took a

_ ‘toll on my physical health. After I embed-
 ded a nail in my foot for the third time, I

learned to sweep the ﬂoors on a regular
basis.
It took four heavy doses of electric

current for me to learn how to properly ,

wire a house forelectricity, but I learned
nonetheless. There were too many cuts,
scrapes and bruises to list. _ A

200 empty liquor bottles. When I ﬂushed
the toilet in my second-story bathroom,
water poured into the basement. Every
room in the house had carpet that was lit-
erally soaked with (hopefully) dog or cat

urine. Floors had holes big enough to fall

me and soon to be spent on textbooks and
tuition. Not only am I living here rent-
it free, but people are

 paying me money to

’ be able to live here too.
So I’m no longer certain
that the house was ever so
horrible. The memories of

’ Yes, race is an issue that permeates
the entire ﬁlm. Pleasantly, though, it is
brought up in a manner that doesn’t
offend, but in the ‘harmless- spirit of
laughing at matters which have painful-
ly thread themselves into the American
fabric.

Many critics trying to rankthis with
similar stand—up comedy ﬁlms have
erroneously placed “Kings of Com y”
at the bowels of the list. “Kings of
Comedy” easily leads the pack — at
least in the top three, right ‘behind
Pryor’s “Live At the Sunset Strip” and
Murphy’s :§Raw.” .

No other stand-up comedy ﬁlm
shares the same slick directorial stylings,
sound quality and editing as Lee execut-
ed for this movie. Lee’s low camera
angles made each comedian appear larg-
er than life while standing beneath a
gigantic crown suspended in the air. This
visual effect, coupled with the crisp, tai-
lor-made suits donned by the comedians,
made ﬂiem appear as true royalty —— a
lot classier than Murphy’s leather
“Th1ille1”- costumes. 2

What makes this movie so superior
over others in the same genre is the dif-
ferent‘ elements that each comedian
brings to the table. Of the four, you’re
bound to fall in stitches over at least two.

If you sit down to this movie look-
ing to be offended, yourawish will most
likely be granted as it would at any com-
edy movie. Ifyou’re looking to be enter-
tained and can laughabout so many of

Maybe it’s the melodic tempo‘

and tranquility of Jennifer Sbragia
and Rose Melberg’s Voices that cap-

take it personally. We know how it

The Softies borrowed their
name from a British new wave
group and made it known around
the independent music scene when
they signed to legendary indie rock-
er Calvin Johnson’s record label, K

Both Sbragia and Melberg were
involved in other: bands ——' Tiger

The sophomore release from

their native Atlanta, but a display of
their production skillsiand their con-

Parental Advisory produced the
majority of thealbum, which employs
live instrumentation with heavy per-

out the album, as well as the
rapid. drum beats,

into the mind of the group and also
explains the title of the CD.

The use of guitar on “U Got We
Got” creates a hypnotizing melody to
which the group provides substantial
lyrics without the assistance of any
other performers, and is probably the
best song on the album.

The notable guest appearances
Goodie Mob,
Youngbloodz, Noreaga, Pimp C and
Jim Crow. This primarily Southern
all—star cast provides the best songs
on the album — “Down Flat” featur-
ing T.I.P. and “Dope Stories” featur-
ing Noreaga, Pimp C and Big Gipp of
Goodie Mob. Each of these songs
provide a contrasting view of south-
ern rap to the high—tempo bounce and
dance music that has recently gained
popularity.

Overall the albums’ strong pro—

duction and guest appear-

ances create a diver-
sity sound that
works. The
. group’s ability
q to produce their
. own unique sound
far outstrips their

and saves what would otherwise be an
average CD.

Panther rre f run at Bigas

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Staff Writer

Pitt’s cross country teams open
their. seasons this weekend at the
Mountaineer Invitational in
Morgantown, W.Va., against teams
from West Virginia University and
Youngstown State University. ‘

-Head coach, Waddie Freeman has
high expectations for both teams.

“The men worked-"hard over the
summer,” Freeman said. “They came
in in good shape.”

“The women’s program has the
opportunity to have a much better

-‘season than last year,” continued
‘Freeman, who is in charge of the

women’s team for thefirst time.
The men will receive solid lead-
ership from returning seniors and

captains Mike Head an_d Justin Wiley, '

both of whom are coming off strong
summer workouts and excellent out-
door track seasons.

“Head is our top returning finish-
er,” Freeman said of the runner who
finished 32nd in the Big East Cross
Country Championships last year.

Wiley also did well in the confer-

, ence meet, finishing in the top 50.

The Panthers also expect to‘
receive good times and places from
sophomore Jessie Chalfant, one of
the team’s top 800—meter runners.

Freeman said.
shape.”

“Chalfant did a very good job in
the Big East,” Freeman said. “He’ll
be a main contributor.” I

On the women’s side, the
Panthers will be powered and led by
returning runners Amanda Schmidt
and Katie Weeks.

“This is the first time [Schmidt]’s
been healthy in a few months,”
“She’s in excellent

A talented core of middle-dis-
tance runners will also supplement
the women’s success. Included in

that group is freshman Elizabeth.

Bain.

“Bain was -a premier ha1f—miler in
high school,” Freeman said.

Freeman’s immediate" goals for
his teams this weekend are for his
runners to get closer in ‘respect to
their times and their spirits. ' .

“So far, the teams are gellin
very well,” Freeman said. “The key
is to run as a pack.” _

p Freeman said that there will be
more success if the team members
run times that are close together. He
expects the No.1 and No. 5 runners to
finish within a minute of each other.

Freeman also wants his teams to
run with both WVU and YSU, but
mostly WVU. '

Can you smell it?»

Penn State head football coach Joe Patemo is rot-
ting and so are his unranked Nittany

l  

Lions. Two days after getting
knocked all over the ﬁeld by Southern
Cal, Joe Pa sat down at his weekly
press conference.

However, this press conference
seemed different from years’ past. Patemo

wasn’t the same man.

It seems as though Father Time has final-
ly tracked Joe Pa down and forced him to suc-

cumb to his wrath.

The man, who soon enough will hold the all-

_ time Division I-A record for total wins, ‘was as
‘ sharp as a butter knife. . '

’ ,Paterno struggled throughout the press confer-
ence to answer simple questions. He constantly made
excuses for his players saying thatthey played hard.
- But, in reality, they didn’t play hard and they didn’t

The question remains — can Patemo
still win? Keep something in mind; last

past so feared. ,

The first game after Sandusky’s departure was an
embarrassment on national television. The team did
not look prepared and certainly was not composed.

Maybe it was Sandusky that made the Patemo
illusion last so long. Maybe he was the glue that kept
the team together. And maybe, just maybe, he was the

- man that helped to make Patemo the legend that he is
today. -

It’s been too long since Pitt has beaten Penn State,

' but this just might be the year. The last two games
between the two teams have been thrillers but both
resulted in losses for the Panthers. '

In 1998, the Panthers lost 20-13 in front of a rau-

' cous sellout crowd at Pitt Stadium. Last season Pitt
lost a heartbreaker when LaVar Arrington blocked
Nick Lotz’s ﬁeld goal in the final seconds, falling 20-

It is rare for the Big East to schedule a
conference game in the first week of the
season, but the Eagles and Mountaineers
will waste no time in squaring off in‘ this
crucial contest. After Miami and Virginia
Tech, these two teams, along with Pitt and
Syracuse, will most likely be battling for
two bowl spots. ‘

The Eagles will have Tim Hasselbeck

back after rushing for 1,122 yards last sea’-

West Virginia counters with quarter-
back Brad Lewis, who replaces the gradu-
ated Marc Bulger, and sophomore running
back Avon Cobourne,- who gained 1,139
yards in 1999. ’

Cobourne and Washington are the top
two returning running backs in the con-

orable, Assuming the Panthers win
their first two games, beating Penn
State could elevate this team to levels it
hasn’t seen in years. Excitement is
building on campus. There seems to be
a cautious buzz going around.

The last time Pitt beat Penn State
was 1988. It’s payback time.

The date for the first game of the
millennium between the two rivals is
Sept. 16. I know the upperclassmen- are
ready for it and by that date, -I hope that
the freshmen get the gist of the rivalry.

are._

They. don’t have a talented

has two starting seniors.

Of course, Mora was talking
