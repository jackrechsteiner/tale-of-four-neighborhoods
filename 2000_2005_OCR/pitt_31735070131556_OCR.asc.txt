Volume XCVIII, Number 11

Tuitionincreased 9.5 percent

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
Managing Editor

Pitt students and their fam-
ilies will be forced to dig a lit-
tle deeper into their pocket

books when they receive their '

» tuition bills this August — 9.5
percent deeper for in—state stu-
dents and 7.5 percent for those
from outside the state.

The tuition hike was
announced Monday morning
during Pitt’s board of tmsteesf
budget committee meeting.

The percentage increase
will raise the costiof in—state
tuition by about $750, bring-
ing the annual cost toi$8,6l4,
and out—of-state students will
pay $17,926 each year.

This tuition increase
means Pitt students will now
pay one of the highest public

university tuition rates in the.

nation. Because of dwindling
state and federal funding for
education, most public institu-
tions are being forced to raise

their price tags.

In Pennsylvania, Pitt was
not alone in raising its tuition
this year — Pennsylvania
State University raised in—state
tuition by about 9.8 percent for

most students, Carnegie
Mellon raised it 8.5 percent for
new students and the

University of Pennsylvania,
raised tuition 4.8 percent.
“We, like all higher educa-
tion institutions, are facing ris-
ing costs,” said Vice
Chancellor" of Budget and
Controller Arthur Ramicone.
“What unfortunately is
happening is that students in
this area are being priced out
of an education,” Student
Government Board member
Todd Brandon Morris said in
/response to the rising tuition
costs in Pennsylvania.
Chancellor B Mark
Nordenberg cited several fac-
tors that forced Pitt to raise

.tuition this year, after last

year’s 14 percent increase.

Among those factors were a
continually rising standard of
excellence, the rising costs of
technology and the labor mar-
ket, a “dramatic increase” in
the cost of healthcare and the
continually decreasing finan-
cial support from the state
government. _ ’
Nordenberg said that Pitt
expects only 12.3 percent from
the state in budget support,
which is down from an all-
time high of 32 percent in

1,-1975. He'went on to say that

Pitt would receive’ $163 mil-
lion this year, compared to an
appropriation of $178 0 million
in 2002.

Howeve,r_,,the
Commonwealth was forced to
reduce the 2002 amount to
about $173 million as aresult
of its own financial '- chal-
lenges.

“These decisions really are
the product of a yearlong

process,” N ordenberg said,

acknowledging I that students

and their families are appre-
hensive of another substantial
rise in tuition. A

As a result of Pitt’s limited
resources, it has developed,
according to theChancellor, “a
culture’ of cost—effectiveness.”

“We accept the fact that
we are expected to do more
with less,” he added.

“Since 1995, [Pitt] has
invested in quality,” the chan-
cellor said, explaining that Pitt
plans to continue to make.
investments in the people, pro-
grams and facilities to ensure
quality education.

In order to combat the

‘effects of less funding and

higher costs, Pitt plans to
increase the financial aid bud-
get for next year by $8 million
dollars, bringingthe total bud-
get to more than $100 million
dollars. ,
But‘ Morris’ said that '_he
fears financial aid will not

MARIAH MOORE

~

The sound of chainsaws ﬁlled the por-
tico of the Allegheny County Courthouse
last Wednesday, when Penn Environment
members held a tongue-in-cheek protest to
the-Bush» administration’s changes to the
Roadless Area Conservation Rule. Seven
members gave a “21 Chainsaw Salute,”
revving their chainsaws three times in ‘uni-

THE PITT NEWS

Environmentalists fear ramifications of rule’s appeal

Chainsaw, page 1,

ing to the group, seeks to “gut” the rule
with its own proposal of ‘commercial
logging. The group does not believe the
proposal will beneﬁt the public, but
instead will permit the special interests
of corporations to destroy America’s
publicly—owned national forests.
Bush’s proposal would cut the
Alaskan Tongass Rainforest from the
protection of the Roadless Initiative and
give governors the power to also
exempt their state forests from the law,
according to Penn Environment. Such
exemptions counter Clinton’s Roadless

Initiative, which his - administration
issued in its ﬁnal days in ofﬁce.

The proposed changes address con-
cerns that Penn Environment’s protest
did not. Since the rule’s inception,
Alaska has fought to keep logging per-
missible in its forests, citing economic
need. The scientiﬁc community has also
said the rule will limit its use of forests.

The rule does allow new road con-
struction for the purpose of ﬁghting for-
est ﬁres and clearing brush for public
safety, but the group fears the Bush
administration will‘ use this allowance
to increase access for loggers.

If the rulestays intact, it will pro-

EDITORIAL

Will our investment prove a sound one?

Pitt announced last week that
tuition would be hiked a whopping 9.5
percent, just in time for fall classes.
This is considerably less than last
year’s convenient 14 percent hike —
convenient because it neatly matched
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s 14 per-
cent pay raise — but it’s still a bitter pill
to swallow.

The increase was not unexpected,
nor could it really be called unreason-
able. The economy — in the city, the
state and the nation — is in the toilet.
State appropriations have gone down
because federal funding has gone
down, and someone has to ‘pick up the
slack. V

The administration wants to placate
us ‘with the line that Pitt is a quality
institution, which it is. The" improve-
ments they point to, though, are cos-
metic at best, and completely unsub-
stantiated at worst.

We’ve got an abundance of new
signs and seals, and a lovely new acad-
ernic building at Sennott Square, not to
mention the palatial Petersen’ Events
Center.. These are pleasant improve-
ments, but they don’t do much for grad-
uates’ resumes. —. ,

The administration also cites small-
er class sizes- and better advising.
Vlrrthout numbers‘to back up the claim
of smaller class sizes, the statement
rings hollow _to ‘anyone who’s had to
cram into the back of a crowdedlecture

hall. “Better advising” sounds great, but
how can such a statement be proved? '

College is an investment. Like all
investments, the startup can be difficult,
involving ﬁnancial hardship and acade-
mic tenacity —- as it should. But if Pitt
wants to continually sell the idea that
sinking cash into the University is a
good investment, it should show sound
returns.

The current climate of consistent
tuition hikes without quantiﬁable bene-
ﬁts in line with those hikes is going to

have debilitating effects on the region,

for decades to come.

A graduate with a bachelors’ degree
 seen by many as the new high school
diploma, needed for the most basic of

positions — is not guaranteed a job or a «.

place_in grad school. The only thing she
can count on_ is debt. . _
Then, some chipper kid from

iTeleFund calls our grad ten years later

asking for a donation. Our grad is quite
possibly still paying, in the form of loan
repayments, for her time at‘ Pitt. It’s
doubtful she will be in a position to
contribute, which will just perpetuate
Pitt’s cash shortage. .

No one’s asking for the Tuition.

Fairy to come along and make it so
everyone who’s smart enough can go to
college. Sadly, everyone put that ideal-

istic dream to bed a while ago. What"

would be nice, though, is a solid return
on our investment.

Hypocrisy and embarrassment

I saw the embassy as more of a fonnal-
ity than an obstacle. After all, letters had been
written, money paid, passports obtained and
appointments made. Besides, they were trav-
eling to the United States as part of an edu-
cational program. I thought it was in the bag.

But, when it all ended, only one of the
three Jamaican students who applied was
granted a visa to come back with us to con-
tinue the program in the United States.

The event was an act of
injustice, hypocrisy and
incompetence. The day it hap-

process, same answer.

Andrew’s interview lasted a bit longer.
He pressed them to acknowledge the letters
and explained the program. He was
approved and granted a visa for a one-time
entry into the United States. And I’m grate-

ful. I had a great time showing Andrew‘

around the city. »

But why were the girls rejected? Our
foreign embassies seem to have a guilty-

invaluable as ﬁiends and guides as the trip

progressed, accompanied us 16 Americans.

The plan was to bring them back with
us a week or so after the trip, show them
around Pittsburgh, and have them return to
Jamaica with the next trip sponsored by the
same organization. But ﬁrst, they had to get
visas.

Meanwhile, the students were busy ﬁll-

Once this was done, they had to pay a non-
refundable fee of $115 — the armual per
capita income in Jamaica is $2,820 —— just
for permission to request an interview
appointment at the U.S. embassy. The inter-
views were granted within a week.

The two girls, Shaneek and Nadia, went
ﬁrst. The ﬁrst walked into the interview
room, where the interviewer sat behind
glass. Discussion was canied out through
microphones. Two minutes passed, during
which the interviewer didn’t mention the let-
ters written on her behalf, and then the
answer was given: no, the United States

And I’ll give them an approving nod.

But to exaggerate these concepts in
order to justify bureaucratic elitism and
incompetence is wrong.

The trials facing international students ‘

staying in the United States don’t stop at the

entry process, either. As of February 1-5, co1— .

would be entered into an Irnmigration and

New Warhol exhibits not upto par

iiKeith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett ‘

The American Supermarket
Through October ,5

The Andy Warhol Museum

117 Sandusky St.

(412) 237-8300

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A & E Editor .

The “Summer of Andy” continues at The Andy Warhol
Museum this month with two new exhibitions, “Keith
and “The American
Supermarket.” In keeping with the previous exhibitions in
the “Summer of Andy,” like the Elvis Presley photography
exhibit and the collection of political cartoons, these two
newest exhibitions deal with the roles of celebrity and
Americarrisrns in popular culture. . Unfortunately, these
newest exhibitions are not as successful as the. earlier
exhibits. . i

"The “Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett” exhibit will
surely be the one that attracts the most attention, ' _
thanks to Farrah Fawcett’s name recognition.

the exhibit contains a collection of works by
artists Edmier and Fawcett — some done by both
together — and one piece by Warhol, a silkscreen

gallery space is so large and the pieces in the col-
lection so small, there is an underwhelming feel-
ing to the exhibition. V t ‘
i The two largest pieces, life-size sculptures of
Fawcett, done by Edmier, and of Edmier, done by

Edmier’s white marble Fawcett sculpture shows

bronze and depicts a nude Edmier leaning against
a rock-like formation. V ~ we -

Of the pair, the sculpture done by Edmier is
the more aesthetically pleasing. The white marble
depiction is striking in its attention to detail to the
nude ﬁgure of Fawcett while conveying a sense
of haunting mystery to the fonn. Fawcett’s sculpture of
Edmier, on the other hand, is much more static. His nude
form‘ looks much stiﬂ"er and, in places, disproportional, when
compared to the ﬂuid shape of the Fawcett sculpture.

There are a few other interesting pieces peppered throughout

the rest of the exhibit One, olf in a back comer of the space, —
- .. is ;“Untitled (Shell)”, a large -shell sculpture completed in

2001 and formed entirely out of melted periwinkle blue
Crayola crayons. Inside the sculpture is sand from Padre-
Island, Texas, with two footprints in it. The melted crayons

, give the shell sculpture a texture similar to that of a real shell.

With the pungent smell of crayons coming from the sculp-
ture and the interesting medium in which this sculpture was

done, it’s one of the more interesting pieces in the exhibit. ”

Above this sculpture is a photograph titled “The Space
Between You and Me.” It shows an intimate moment
between Edmier and Fawcett, Edmier, eyes closed, on the
left of the image, close to Fawcett who is on the right of the

image, eyes open and with a guarded look on her face.

It’s in this image, as well as “Untitled (Fanah Fawcett
Se1f—Port1ait)”, where the issue of celebrity is broached in the
exhibit The self—portrait shows a full ﬁgure with its face cov-
ered and, on the right of this image, a large face, almost the
size of the faceless ﬁgure.

» Both images, the self-portrait and the photograph, play
off of Fawcett’s celebrity status. In the photo, Edmier looks
as ifhe’s content to be as close as he is to the star and lost in
the moment, while Fawcett is unable to get as comfortable.
Is he happy to be there only because she is Farrah Fawcett?
Or is he happy for being with the woman who just happens
to be Farrah Fawcett? Similarly, in the self-portrait, Fawcett
has her face covered as if she doesn’t want to have her face
detract from the rest of her, while she realizes that celebrity
comes ‘down to image, hence the large face in the 'self—por—
traitlf these ideas were carried throughout the entire exhibit,
it would be much more interesting than it is. The rest of the
pieces in the exhibit ‘— a few smaller sculptures, sketches
and photographs upon which those sculptures are based, and
items which inspired the work of both Edmier and Fawcett

—- are ultimately only noteworthy because they focus on the A

star image of  Fawcett and were done by her or with

her help. This, itself, is a comment on the idea of celebrity, -

but it doesn’t generate the same effect as seeing walls of
images of Elvis and the toll that celebrity took on  This
exhibit seems to try to accomplish the same thing, but, in the
end, cannot ‘ .

0 The other exhibit opening along with “Keith Edmier
and Fanah Fawcett” is “The American Supermarket,” a
reconstruction of an exhibit created by Ben Birillo that orig-
inally opened in New York in 1964 which featured the works
of Pop artists like Billy Apple,‘ Roy Liechtenstein and
Warhol. . * .

“The American Supermarket” at The Warhol is a recre-
ation, created from photographs of the original exhibit taken
by Henri Dauman, for “Shopping: A Century of Art and
Consumer Culture,” an exhibit that opened at the Kunsthalle
Schirn Frankfurt and Tate Liverpool in 2002.

“The American Supermarket” is in a much smaller
space than the Edmier and Fawcett exhibit and begins with
many of Warhol’s Campbell soup can works. While looking

.4

at these works, the sound of Muzak can be heard emanating
from ‘an enclosed, smaller space within the exhibit It is here
where the “supermarket” is housed.

“The American Supermarket” is a supennarket—like
setup that contains foods created out of plastic, wax, metal,
fuzzy fabrics, clay and other materials. The ﬁrst things to be
found when walking into the “supermarket” are ﬁshes and
meats. These are obviously plastic, being kept cool in their
freezers with plastic ice cubes; it is their colors make them
realistic. But sitting on top of the freezer case is a carton of
silver eggs. From this point, the sense of believability to these
“foods” ceases. ‘C '

Wax eggs stacked one carton above another sit next to
other cartons of eggs, created out of a fuzzy fabric, that are
black and gold. Then there are more metallic eggs, as well as
a carton of red, white and blue eggs. It is here where the com-
mentary this exhibit tries to - make about America and its
commodiﬁcation begins. ‘ A

The other foods — apples, bananas, cabbage, pears,
peppers and cantaloupes — are also represented the way the
eggs are, in metal and various colored But this time, the dis-
colored foods, like white or black apples, have supermarket
tags above them that read “Rome Beauty’ ’ and
“Delicious,” when they look anything but
that

There are also red, white and blue foods,
bunched together in crates and bags, sitting
atop cartons that are emblazoned with the
word  These draw the viewers’
attention to the idea thatAmerica is a nation of
- excess and commercialization.

Ifthis ideais at all in doubt, tumaround
from the fruit and vegetable stand, and see a
' group of white plastic hats with red, white and
 blue cardboard wrapped around the crowns.
 Underthesehatsisatagthatreads “Reducexl
as Marked” This is tantamount to the exhibit
hitting you over the head with its ideas, but
does strikingly depict our nation’s fascination
with buying more than we need and, through
the hats, selling out our patriotism.

Unfortunately, this is all the exhibit is, and
'it’s much less than what the original 1964
L exhibit was. In the original, the plastic foods
had astronomical price tags, while the works of the Pop
artists had smaller prices attached to them. This is an equal-
ly overt criticism of the United States’ consumerism, but is a
much more interesting one than having plastic hats with a
sign that says “Reduced as Marked”

It’s interesting to see an exhibit that is a recreation of one
of the most important Pop art shows, and there is an added
dimension to the exhibit when you consider that it is a recre-

ation of a recreation of what the Pop artists considered a fake ’

place, the American supennarket. But because of its small
size and the things missing from the original exhibit, this
becomes, like the Edmier and Fawcett exhibit, underwhelm-
mg. ' '

Both the “Keith Edmier and Fanah Fawcett" and “The.
American Supermarket” exhibits are worth visiting while
they are housed at The Warhol, through October 5. However,
they are somewhat disappointing in light of the earlier
exhibits that have opened during the “Summer of Andy” cel-
ebration. »«

Walking the plank would be better than this i

Pirates of the Caribbean:
The Curse of the Black »

Peaﬂ

Starring Johnny Depp, Geoffrey
Rush, Keira Knightley, Orlando
Bloom

Directed by Gore Verbinski

-ihfr

Despite the involvement of producer
Jerry Bruckheirner (“Armageddon” and
this surnmer’s “Bad Boys II”), whose
philosophy of success at the box office
may very well be to blow up everything
in sight and then blow up the remaining

ashes, “Pirates of the Caribbean” would
actually be boring if it weren’t for a few
actors’ contributions.

It’s a raucous—but—not-too-raucous
ﬁlm — from Walt Disney -— about
pirates and civilized guys ﬁght-
ing over a piece of gold and a
pretty girl. The girl is
Elizabeth swann (“Bend It
Like Beckham” sweetheart
Keira Knightley), a govemor’s
daughter who is abducted by nasty
pirates that turn intq goofy CGI skeletons
when moonlight hits them. These baddies

are the crew of the Black Pearl, led by J

Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who mistak-

an

enly identiﬁes Elizabeth as the girl whose
blood they need in order to lift a curse
that keeps them from ever satisfying their

- hunger or quenching their thirst, a curse

that basically takes the fun out of
being a pirate.

Lowly blacksmith and
law—abiding citizen Will
Turner (Orlando Bloom),
secretly in love with

Elizabeth, enlists the ‘leg-
endary-for-not-being-a-legend
Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to
help him rescue, and thereby woo, the
girl. .
But the whole affair just isn’t that

exciting. Based on a 10-minute arnuse—
ment park ride, the ﬁlm coasts along
from one soft action sequence to another
-—- they’re like ﬁreworks bought at a gro-
cery store — for, absurdly enough,
almost two and a half hours.

It’s the performance of Johnny Depp
that makes the ﬁlm watchable. The actor
hasn’t pulled out this kind of bizarreness
in years. His character is an aberration,
practically a new invention in comedy.
Our ﬁrst look at him — his permanent

' drunken gaitand slippery talk — is actu-
ally disarming. And through all the
movie’s mediocrity that follows, he
remains captivating. \

Geoffrey Rush also does great work,
even as the ﬁlm around him sinks. He’s
much more devoted than the script
deserves, made up so grimy and haggard
that he looks like Nick Nolte.

And the Disney factor? “Pirates” is
the ﬁrst PG-13 film the studio has ever
released — the mouse is open to broad-
ening its horizons now that traditional
animation is dead and its contract with
Pixar is ending — and while it’s not
graphic, it does feature _a pretty clear gun-
shot wound to the head, some throat
slashes and bunch of walking skeletons

i that had kiddies squirming at a local

screening.
The 8-year-old boys loved it though.
They absolutely loved it.

Pitt baseball headncoach Joe Jordano was named the Erie Person of the Year for
his contributions to the sport in both Erie, Pa., as Well as Erie county.

Affidavi

t: Priest

supplied alcohol

JOE MARCHILENA

 Sports Editor

According to an aﬂidavit with a police
warrant, witnesses told police that the Rev.
Henry Krawczyk supplied alcohol to Pitt
football player Billy Gaines the night that
Gaines suffered

vious parties and, according to one player,
Krawczyk showed theP1ayboy Channel on
television during a prior party.

Krawczyk resigned as a pastor of St.
Maximilian Kolbe parish, a group of ﬁve
churches in Homestead, on July 3, and has
not been charged in connection with

Gaines’ death or the alleged

fatal injuries in a

fa“ The amdavi, Tms WEEKN

alleges that . .
Gaines and four E

a cookout, at 1 p _ _,,..,.
which liquor’ was‘, supplied by} f _

Krawczyk, on June 17, according to a
report by the Associated Press.

Gaines, a 19-year-old wide receiver
from Ijamsville, Md., fell 25 feet from the

ceiling of Hornestead’s St. Anne Catholic.

Church around 2:30 am. on June 18, and
died 20 hours later from head and spinal
injuries.

According to an autopsy, Gaines’
blood-alcohol content was .16.
Pem1sylvania’s legal limit for driving is 0.1.

Friends of Gaines, whom the police
would not identify, claimed that Krawczyk
supplied alcohol to underage people at pre-

underage drinking.
Krawczyk has been
accused of providing alco-
hol to minors twice before.
In 1986, a family
accused the priest of sup-
plying their 18-year-old
son with alcohol and
marijuana, and, in 1992,

  
  
 

a woman told the Roman,
. Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh that she

believed that Krawczyk had provided alco-
hol to her teenage son. Krawczyk denied
both allegations.

Pitt ofﬁcials had no comment concern-
ing the aﬁidavit -

J ordano named Person. of the Year

The Pitt baseball team earned more
recognition on Friday, when it was
armounced that head coach Joe Jordano

WIPS, page 12

Among the number of things I wrote in this space last
week, I said that Roger Clemens should not have made the
All-Star team just for sentimental value. The fact that he’s
retiring after this season doesn’t mean he should take up a
spot, especially after having a mediocre season thus far.

This week, I stand by that statement, despite the fact
that Major League Baseball has decided otherwise.

On Monday, the commissioner’s oﬁice announced that
Clemens had been added to the American Leagueroster in

‘place of Oal<land’s Barry Zito.» _ ‘

VV1th Zito having thrown 106 pitches in a game on
Sunday, baseballand the A’ s decided that there was no need
to overwork the pitcher. _

Usually, this kind of decision is left up to the players,
but in this case, the decision was made for Zito, which isn’t
necessarily wrong. ,

Making the decision to remove a guy from the All-Star
game because he’s hurt or fatigued is a good thing. There’s
no need to risk further injury for an exhibition game,
although MLB claims the game actually means something
this year.

But to tell a player he can’t participate in baseball’s sec-

ond biggest event in order to put a future Hall-of—Famer
with stats below his usual standards on the roster is not right.

In _a head-to-head comparison, the pitchers’. numbers
are similar.

Both have 8-6 records, and their earned run averages,
walks, hits per innings pitched and bat-
ting averages against are all similar. , A
The only difference is that Clemens  
has.50 more strikeouts and 15 fewer
walks in 10 fewer  than Zito.

VV1th those numbers, as well as the
names that didn’t make the list, in
mind, it’s safe to say that neither one
deserved to be on the All-Star team.

There are a handful of pitchers
who have better numbers than Zito and
Clemens this season, but they are staying at home rather
than heading to Chicago. _

Two that stand out are Sidney Ponson of the Orioles
and New York’s David Wells. .

Both pitchers have ERAsr approaching four, but
Ponson is second in the AL in wins with 12, while Wells is

  

  All-Star appearance should be for great season

tied for ﬁfth with .11.
Neither is close to Clemens’ 128 strikeouts, but Ponson

‘ and Wells are not strikeout pitchers. Clemens is. _ ,

Ponson and Wells have WI-IlPs that are similar to
Clemens’ and Zito’s, but Wells’ strikeout—to—walk ratio of
11-to-one is much better than

E N A 5 S Clemens’ ratio of three—to-one.

' ' But neither Ponson nor Wells
have the career numbers that Clemens
has.

Almost completely assured of
_ getting into the Hall—of—Fame on the

- V ﬁrst ballot, Clemens ranks, along with

Nolan Ryan, as one of the greatest
i pitchers of the last 20 years.
2 With more than 300 wins and

4,000 strikeouts, Clemens is by far the best active pitcher, as

far as career accolades are concerned. But face it — at 40-

years old, Clemens, is not the same pitcher that he once was.

That’s why he’s retiring after this season.

Men’s soccer recruits look to fill void left by seniors

WIPS, page 11

had been named the Erie Person of the
Year.

Presented by the Baseball Committee
of the City/County All-Star Game in Erie,
Pa, the award was given to Jordano for his
long-time support of, and accomplishments
in, high school and college baseball in Erie
and Erie County.

Jordano ﬁnished his sixth season at Pitt
in 2003, during which the Panthers com-
piled a 36-20 record overall and ﬁnished
13-13 in the Big East. The tea1n’s 72 wins
over the past two seasons mark the highest
total for that span in school history.

Before coming to Pitt, Jordano spent
10 years at Mercyhurst College‘ in Erie.
During that time, Jordano became the

- schoo1’s winningest coach, compiling a

283-118 overall record, along with winning
two conference championships and appear-
ing in the postseason six times.

‘Savini earns academic honors

On July 7, Pitt swimmer Carolyne
Savini received College Swim Coaches
Association of America Academic All-
American honors for the 2002-2003 acade-
mic year.

To be considered for the CSCAA
honor, student-athletes must have earned at

least a 3.5 grade point average and be a let-
ter winner. Savini’s GPA was 3.63.

A communications/rhetoric major,
Savini placed 11th in the 200-yard back-
stroke at the NCAA Championships and
earned honorable mention All-American
honors.

During the season, Savini broke six
individual Pitt records and helped Pitt ﬁnish
ﬁfth at the Big East Championship.

Men’s soccer adds six _

With 10 seniors graduating from a
team that went 8-9-1 in 2002, Pitt head
coach Joe Luxbacher needed to ﬁnd some-
one to take their place.

)1 §'

This year, the Panthers add six fresh-
men, one of the largest recruiting classes
Luxbacher has had in recent years. '

“We have recruited a strong class of
student-athletes that are very talented,” he
said. “We have met our immediate needs
with this class and we hope some will step
in and make an early impact for our team.”

This year’s recruiting class includes

Tyler Bastianelli, Jonathon“Clow, Jeremy '

Gillespie, Brian Madden and Jeﬁrey‘Tidd.

‘The key to this season willbe to mesh
our incoming players with the returning
core of the team,” Luxbacher said. “We
have high expectations for this season, and
I believe that we’ll be a good team.”

Clemens not

the best, option

as replacement

Marchilena, page 11 ‘

Which brings us back to the original
point -— Clemens does not belong at the
All-Star game because he has had a great
career. That’s what the Hall of Fame is for.

Ifhe had 300 wins and 4,000‘ strikeouts
hr the ﬁrst half of the season, then he should
be invited to play in the summer classic.
Hell, they should rename the Cy Young
Award after him, with those numbers.

But it’s impossible to put up those kind
of numbers in one season, let alone half a
season. '

If it was so important: to have Clemens
-at the All-Star game,, give him a special
invite, much like baseball did for‘ Tony
Gwynn‘ during his ﬁnal season and like the
National Hockey League did for Mario
I_.emieux when he came out of retirement

‘It’s not .right to deny otherplayers a
spot on the All-Star team just because ﬂie
Rocket’s red glare looks more like smol-
dering ash. A
