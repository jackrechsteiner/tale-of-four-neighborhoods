VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 98

Engineers race to build car, win contest

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor '

They got it from zero to 60 in three sec-
onds last year. Bolting together a 600-cubic
centimeter Honda motorcycle _engine, four
tires, a roll bar and thousands of hours of
work, Pitt’s Society of Automotive

1 Engineers designed a 500-pound race car
that placed 31st in a national competition
last year. '

Last week, four members of the group
canied that car up the stairs outside Tower B.
They turned it on its side and wheeled the
four—cylinder, four-stroke engine through the
double doors leading into Towers lobby.

In the next few months, it will be disas-
sembled and sold for parts. The car still

works well, but the team needs to build a .

new one this year. And according to the

strict, 82-page manual that governs the A

national racing competition, not a single part
in the engine can be reused. ‘ ’

According to that manual, cars entered
in competition cannot cost the groups more
than $25,000, but even $21,000 — the esti-
mated cost of last year’s car — isn’t _easy to
‘come by. ’

Thus, four Society of Automotive
Engineers members carried their 2001 vehi-
cle into Towers lobby. The group used last

year’s vehicle as a promotional stunt, hoping

to not only convince students to purchase a '

spring break raffle ticket but also to attract
new members. -

“We’re. always open to having more
help around the shop,” SAE member Jared
Rosenthal said. The sophomore mechanical
engineer is one of about 20 members — all

_but one are mechanical engineers. The other

is an electrical engineer.

DAVE HARTMAN/NEWS EDITOR

Jim Shaw, Audrey Wood and Jared Rosenthal work with the 2001 race car built by SAE.

For $2, students‘ passing through
Towers lobby last week could buy a raﬁle

ticket, entering themselves into a drawing

for an_all-expense-paid spring break trip to
Florida, Texas, the Bahamas or J amaica.
Thegroupwillalsobetakingatripthis
year to the armual competition ——'— the pinna-
cle of a year’s worth of automotive tinkering
and design. _ -
Rosenthal said the group goes to great

lengths to know and understand all 82 pages
of the competition’s rules and is working on
ways to win within those rules.

“You have to ﬁnd ways around the rules
to beat the other schools,” he said. “You
have to be more innovative.”

Other schools have to use a similar
engine size and follow those same extensive
rules. Last year, Pitt raced against about 125
other teams.

And though 31st -place is nothing to
scoﬁ" at, Rosenthal said the 2001 team could
have done better if the car hadn’t overheat-
ed

Rosenthal and many of the other mem-
bers have high hopes for this year’s car,
which uses a “proven design” and is built
with the help of outside funding.

“We rely heavily on sponsors,”
Rosenthal said. . '

V But, he added, it wouldn’t come togeth-
er , without the dedication of the group’s
members. According to Rosenthal, the
Society of Automotive Engineer’s president,
Pete Sakovich, spends much of his time in
the group’s Benedum Hall basement shop.

“Pete probably put in 80 hours last
week,” Rosenthal said '

The group’s workload isn’t a last
minute crunch. The team will compete in

May.

Law clinic stymied by limits  

Sharp—sighted rodent
  predicts extended winter

on fund raising, report says  

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

As part of the latest in a series of claims
and counterclaims regarding Pitt’s
Environmental Law‘ Clinic, the Tenure and
Academic Freedom Committee of the
University Senate released a six-page report on
Jan. 28 stating the findings of an investigation

' “on the various issues of academic freedom

related to the status, operation and funding” of
the clinic. ' V
The report concludes that by charging

‘ annual overhead andlimiting fund-raising

opportunities, the University imposed ﬁnancial

 burdens upon the clinic in an attempt to indi-
. rectly sway its political direction.

The committee’s report says that although
the University avoided opportunitiesto directly

affect the clinic, it caused indirect constraints

through‘ budget changes and fund-raising
 restrictions. The report also raised issues with

' the kind of persuasion that state legislation has

_over the University and proposed that the best

way to "handle the debate “is through open dis- _‘

cussion and debate.” The Faculty Assembly
discussed the matter in a meeting on Jan. 29.
The University feels that it did nothing to
limit the freedom of the clinic beyond what was
required to meet state allocation requirements.
“The report is inaccurate, incomplete and
we disagree with its conclusions,” University
spokesman Robert Hill said. . '
According to the report, the investigation
stemmed from a request by Pitt law professors

William Luneberg and Jules Lobel to the .

Tenure and Academic Freedom Committee in
November 2001. At about the same time,

Pitt TV station films sitcom in McCormick Hall

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

Chad Lensbower, aka Harv, is
worried about going out tonight. His
roommate, John Steffenauer, aka
Caleb, suggests a bit of liquid courage
to ease his way into the party scene.

“Don’t worry, be drinky,’7
Steffenauer tells him with an evil grin,
shoving a glass into Lensbower’s face,
not unlike the nefarious masters of
peer pressure from sundry after-
school specials in the ‘80s. Even
though the liquid smells remarkably
like apple juice, Lensbower grimaces
and groans, desperate to hold his
lunch in while downing the beverage.

Lensbower and Steffenauer are
not alone. Cramped inside this tiny
suite is another man who records this

heinous act of peer pressure for pos- _

terity.

“Cut!” he yells. “Chad —— I love
you! If it was socially acceptable I’d
have your children. Now let’s do it
again so I can get close—ups of your
face.”

This scene is played out over and
over in a span of 30 minutes in the
cramped McCormick suite. Neither
Steffenauer nor Lensbower actually
live here — the room belongs to this
third man, Sam Cotler. He’s the direc-

“The Pitts,” one of Creation

Station’s ' initial undertakings, is,
according to Cotler, a sitcom based on
“observational humor like ‘Seinfeld.”’

The premise is that, due to a housing '

mix-up, two guys — Caleb and Harv
— wind up sharing a bathroom with
two’ girls. To further complicate mat-
ters, Harv and one of his female bath-
room-mates have a previous history

that Harv refuses to let die. And while~

Cotleris leery of revealing any more
secrets to the plot, he promises lots of

' surprises and laughs.

“Hilarity ensues,” Cotler said.
“That’s our motto. Hilarity always
ensues.”

“A_ lot of the showis about leam—
ing to accept responsibility,” principal
scribe Nick Libeg said. “In college,

R you can have as much or as little as

you want. But it’s also the reality of
college to an absurd extreme. It’s what
we all go through to the whatever
level.’’

has recently been adopted by Creation
Station — is duct-taped to a tripod.

University, clinic differ on

amount of overhead to bepaid  

Law clinic, page 1

University Senate President James
Cassing, announced to the Faculty
Assembly that he would ask the com-
mittee to examine this case.

The report states that the commit-
tee created a subcommittee to “inter-
view University principals, evaluate
the data obtainedand then furnish a
report to the TAFC for approval.”
The committee chose Richard Tobias,
president of the University Senate’s
Anti-Discriminatory Policies
Committee,» Herbert Needleman,
chairman of the Tenure and
Academic Freedom Committee and
Carrie Leana, an associate with the
Learning.Research and Development
Center for the subcommittee.

The report states that interviews
were conducted with Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg, Provost James
Maher, Budget Director Arthur
Ramicone, Law School Dean David
Herring and Tom Buchele, head of
the Environmental Law Clinic and
Luneberg. V ’

The ‘clinic began in 1998 after

'Luneberg requested a place where

environmental law students could
train get courtroom experience. The
Heinz Endowment gave $2 ‘million to
help fund the project, and Buchele
was chosen to head it._

In January 2001, the clinic
accepted a request to represent
Citizens Against New Toll Roads, -a
community group against the build-

‘ing of the Mon-Fayette Expressway.

According to the report, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg responded to state
legislators’ complaints and discus-
sions about Buchele and the repre-
sentation of the citizens group in
June with a letter stating, “The
University is not in a position, and
does not seek to be in a position, to

control the involvements of its
employees in civic life. That includes
involvements in initiatives that may
be politically unpopular.” V

The law clinic controversy grew
in June when state legislators added a
clause to Pitt’s appropriations bill in
the annual state budget, which allo-
cates government money for the
school. The Tenure, and Academic
Freedom report claims stated “No
funds appropriated by this act may be
used for costs of personnel and oper-
ations of the environmental law clin-
ic.” As a result, Pitt began to charge
the clinic for annual overhead costs
beginning in October. '

Though the report says that the
University gave an original estimate
of $62,599, Buchele said the over-
head ﬂuctuates with the amount of
the clinic’s annual budget. Buchele
said that since this year’s budget will
approach $120,000, theannual over-
head will rise as well. At that rate the
clinic would be bankrupt in less than
a year and a half.

Hill said that the overhead
amount was reached by a federal for-
mula and was created only‘to safe-
guard the clause in the appropriations
bill. .
_Buchele said that Pitt also created
restrictions about where the clinic
can raise funds.

“I cannot approach any of the
foundations that they have a current
relationship with,” he said. He added
that the University permitted him to

approach small and national founda- 6

tions. V
Hill said that the limitations ‘on

. fund raising are University standards

in place only when,o'ne group has a
proposal pending with a "foundation.
He added that the report was wrong

in assuming the Environmental Law 0

Clinic alone was. affected.

Sitcomwill debut on Channel 46

Creation Station, page 2

“The last thing I wanted was to
use my room as a set,” Cotler said, but
there was no other good option. Cotler
said he hopes to get an actual studio
up and running at some point, but for
now, has to take his camera all over
Pittsburgh.

“The city is our studio,” he said.

Friends and co-workers are adopt-
ed to take on bit parts and be extras.
Libeg, for example, is desperately
lobbying for the role of “Smoker No.
1.”

The producers of Creation Station
said they hope to have the channel up

and running within two weeks. It will -

be located on Channel 46 in Pitt’s
cable system.. Other shows for
Creation Station‘ are already gearing
up. Steffenauer is also playing a role
in a movie directed by ‘Creation
Station. founder John Paul Horstman.
A news show is set to begin filming
this Wednesday.

“We’re still looking for shows,”
Cotler said. “If you’ve got a good idea
and are really committed to it, we’d
love to give it a try.”

A lesson in rodent meteorology

There will be six more weeks of win-
ter.

At least that’s what Punxsutawney
Phil, the nation’s best known rodent-
tumed-meteorologist, said through his
translator. Saturday morning, Phil was
pulled from his hole in Punxsutawney,
saw his shadow and went back inside to
prepare for another six weeks of winter.

Was his translator accurate? We don’t
lmow, as few speak Groundhogese. Since
Pitt’s linguistics department does not have
an expert in this language, we were unable
to receive independent conﬁrmation of the
translation.

But if we believe that Phil saw his
shadow, then there is another question:
What is his deﬁnition of winter?

Does his vision of his shadow mean
that we’re going to have another six weeks
of the same weather that we’ve had for
most of the last few months? Or does this
mean that real winter will start now?

Unfortunately, the little furball did not
elaborate.

The situation is further compounded
by a conﬂicting prediction from one of
Phil’s competitors, Gen. Beauregard Lee,
Ph.D., in Lilbum, Ga. Beau did not see his
shadow, so according to him, winter is
about to end now.

The question now is whom do we
trust? According to his Web site, Beau
already has one doctorate. Saturday, Dr.
Branson Ritchie of the University of
Georgia’s College of Veterinary Medicine

also proclaimed him a “Doctor of Weather
Prognostication.” Phil, meanwhile, does
not hold two doctorates. On this basis, per-
haps Beau is more trustworthy. -

But then again, Beau is a product of
Georgia’s educational system, while Phil
is a product of Pennsylvania’s. And
although we could not conﬁrm this since
the University was closed for the week-
end, we can fairly well assume that
rodents are not eligible for doctorates in
the_Commonwealth. '

This year’s conﬂict in predictions
shows the problems with relying on a
group of woodchucks for forecasting.
Groundhogs are, after all, just lowly
rodents. "

Perhaps what we need to solve this
problem is to listen to others -—- perhaps
this group of people called meteorologists.
After all, they hold actual degrees and
make weather forecasts —— typically accu-
rate — throughout the year, instead of just
on one day.

But then again, for as bizarre of a hol-

iday as Groundhog Day seems, it is enjoy-‘

able. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported
that more than 40,000 people showed up
for the festivities.

The national news covers this event
from Western Pennsylvania every year.
Those who make the pilgrimage have a
good time.

Maybe, there is something to say for a
day celebrating a rodent’s lackluster mete-
orological skills after all.

- Critics of the women’s movement

outlived its usefulness. .

Even the untalented can experiment in art

After every breakup, I say to myself, “Self,
it’s time to concentrate on your art.” It’s part of a
prescribed regimen that includes venting to
friends, eating various fat—filled comfort foods
and writing down a long list of all the boy’s neg-
ative qualities.

ue, a basket — in the center of the room, and told
us to start sketching. ‘

I spent the remainder of that classroom trying
in vain to draw a violin that bore even a modicum
of resemblance to the musical instrument.
Feeling like an utter failure, I started

The art thing is kind of a joke,
though. I don’t really have art. For
me, making “art” consists of breaking
out the set of watercolors I’ve had
since eighth grade and painting a cou-
ple of colored lines. I know I’m not
very good at it. I just really like the
thought of turning my bitterness into a
creative work during that melancholy
post-breakup period.

With some space left in my sched-

  

Elizabeth Bowen
Managing Editor

thinking about elementary school, and
how skill at art is one of the criteria
that determine your social value then.
The kids that could draw, along with
the good kickball players and good
dodgeball players and budding come-
dians, were cool kids by virtue of their
talent. - V

Back in elementary school art
class, there were always enough slack-
ers to make me look decent by com-

 

ule this semester, I decided to take a

painting class.»I optimistically envisioned myself
wearing artist-chic clothing and exerting the
inner glow of creativity while dipping my brush
into piles of paint on an old-fashioned wooden
palette.

Our first assignment for the class didn’t seem
too terrible. Using the primary colors, we had to
mix what the professor called a chromatic black
—— black with rich undertones of another shade, a
green or purple or blue cast.

The task was a little more difficult than it
seemed, though. You might think you could cre-
ate black by randomly smooshing all the colors
together and stirring them, but that is not the
case. The necessary ratio of blue to yellow to red
is actually rather precise.

As I sat there mixing paints —- achieving
browns, dark greens and blues, anything but
black — I began to doubt myself. Why didn’t I
just take a fiction writing class? Words are the
medium I am used to. Words are not messy.
Words go wherever you put them. Words do not
dry in streaks and clumps on the left side of your
chin-or the sleeve of your sweater.

After finally mastering the whole chromatic
black thing, our professor introduced the next
assignment, a still life. in black, white and differ-
ent shades of gray. He placed a table with an
arrangement of monochromatic objects — a cast
of a violin, fake fruit, the head and torso of a stat-

parison. Here at Pitt, in this class of

freshman Picassos and future studio arts majors,
I was downright wretched.

Before we could begin painting the still life,

we had to finish sketching the arrangement on

canvas. I ended up returning to the studio after A

class with my roommate Amanda in tow for guid-
ance and moral support. While she didn’t pursue

it in college, Amanda is one of those people who

would have been a real standout- in your elemen-
tary art class.

That night in the studio, Amanda taught me a
valuable lesson in proportional drawing: You
start with one simple object, and then draw

everything else in proportion to it. And for this‘

arrangement, there was nothing simpler to start
with than the breasts of the statue.

So that’s how I learned to draw, in an ‘econo-
my of breasts. A fruit is half a breast, the basket
is two and half breasts long, and so on. When I
finished I didn’t have a masterpiece, but it wasn’t
entirely sloppy either. ‘

Now I’m working on filling in the objects,
blending the light and dark parts to make some-
thing that looks like a realistic rendition of shad-
ows and light. This part of the project is easier
than the drawing, but it’s still difficult for me. I
try mybest to paint smooth lines, to mix colors
well, to render objects as they really appear and
not how I imagine them to be. Still, I look at my
canvas and see something that’s not even worthy

of hanging on the wall of a South Oakland base- -.

ment. Not since my freshman year experiment in
ice hockey have I been so terrible at something,
but stuck with it nonetheless.

I’ve decided that it doesn’t really p matter,
though. While I am not always happy with the
outcome, I like the actual act of painting, wetting
my brush and smearing it across the canvas. It’s 9
p.m. on a rainy Wednesday night, it’s class on

Tuesday morning, it’s a Sunday afternoon with at ,

football game on the radio, and I am in the studio,
painting. I am concentrating’ on my art.‘ And now
I don’t even need the excuse of a breakup to do it.

Managing Editor Elizabeth Bowen likes art but
prefers crafts. E—mail her at betsy @pittnews.com.

turn to places where there is a dire need
for change.

In all fairness, NOW sprang to
action after Sept. 11. Launching sever-
al campaigns to promote women’s
roles in the new Afghan government
and encouraging aid for female
refugees, the group rose to a higher
cause.

But the mission in Afghanistan
should be twofold —- to provide
humanitarian aid and to raise women’s
status. The need for humanitarian aid
reaches both sexes, and all Afghanistan
refugees need assistance regardless of
their gender. If NOW only helps suffer-

A_ﬁlA&LA065AA£lIlCO6

ing women while leaving men and
boys to starve, the organization will
practice the same form of sexism it
claims to oppose.

While I commend NOW for ﬁnally
looking beyond our own borders to a
more troubled region, it has only taken
the ﬁrst few steps in a long process.

Women within Afghanistan already
tried to gain minimal rights. Instead of
creating new institutions with limited
funds, NOW could more effectively
work with the indigenous women’s
groups that already exist. NOW should
educate women and teach skills to the
girls who receive little or no education.
An uneducated person can never be
truly liberated.

1.41It45(.i.ool.d1.5-lcérrr-¢.4‘~(:«=n\.i

A thriving sex slave trade in the
Balkans presents another issue for
NOW to tackle. Trafﬁckers lure away
poverty-stricken girls as young as 10 or
12 years old with promises of jobs in
big cities and Western nations as wait-
resses, dancers or children’s nannies.
Instead, the girls are shipped into pros-
titution rings throughout Europe and
the Americas. Intimidated, raped and
beaten into submission, victims rarely
find their ways home.

Instead of quibbling about video
games and fashion shows, NOW
should pressure the international com-
munity to take action against the pros-

titution rings that destroy countless-

women’s lives. Nations must work

'-V‘--'\“I"l"-""I"."',’\'I‘-'7'?-7".9V=:PVV'f'1:'1’\,‘V . ‘ ¢ r * 7 ..>

together to block international slave
trade, while NOW should offer relief
and education to the impoverished vic-
tims.

By taking on oppression V in
Afghanistan, NOW returned to an issue
relevant to its cause. If it continues to
further rights in regions where women
are oppressed — instead of getting

' caught up among trivial issues or a

political agenda —— it will make great

leaps-in furthering the cause of women- I

consider herself a feminist, but she ’ll

nist cause reconsiders its own. Reach

‘ A little girl struggles to’ keep up

‘with her mother, her scarf covering

most of her‘ face. An accomplished
skater whizzes by with. the sound of ice
compressing below the shiny blades of
his skates. A small boy guides himself
along the 4-foot high barriers bordering
the rink. A staff member kneels down
beside the boy, helping him to catch up
with his older siblings. _
The smell of automobile exhaust
does not let you forget you are in the
city, but the environment at PPG Place

helps you escape the hustle with

friends and family. .

Nestled between the six PPG office
towers adjacent to Market Square
Downtown lies the new
diamond—shaped ice skat-
ing rink at PPG Place. The
towering glass buildings
reﬂect skaters young and
old as they circle around a 60-foot, lit
Christmas tree. '

Pittsburgh’s only outdoor rink in
the city opened up during finals week
last semester, not allowing much time
for college students to take advantage
of the new activity. The rink’s manage-

«ment is now attempting to attract col-

lege students with discounted rates and,
radio station visits. ' be A
“As of now, it is looking like w
are going to have a different radio’_sta-
tion lined up every Wednesday for col-

lege night,’ said Anita Falce of Grubbc

& Ellis, the group that manages PPG
Place. “Also, students showing their
college ID will get half off the admis-
sion price on these designated
evenings.”

The rink sits across the street from
Market Square, which offers several
restaurants to dine in before or after

skating. The ‘rink up also _offers _ lockers‘

Roam

and arest area on the ground ﬂoor of 4
PPG Place.

A fun activity for all ages, college
night’ provides local stations the chance
to play their music and guests of the
rink to partake in games and win
prizes. Kiss.FM will be at the next col-
lege night and radio station WXDX
made an appearance on a recent
Wednesday. Staff members are helpful
and easy to locate in bright yellow
jackets, sailing around the rink or help-
ing at the entrance.

. Hillman Properties Inc. funded the
ice skating rink. It acquired PPG Place
from PPG Industries in 1999 when

PPG’s chairman decided Hillman_

Properties would better know how to
commercialize the property.

In the summer, PPG Place will
continue to be a destina-
tion place with a comput-
er-generated water
“expression” fountain in
place of the rink. The rink
will return during the winter months.

Transportation to the rink is easy
by car or bus. Several parking garages
are around PPG Place, which would
cost about $5 for an evening of skating.
You can also take any 61 or 71‘ bus to
Downtown from Oakland, which is

s free with your Pitt D). You just need to

get off at Market Square and you’ll see
the rink. ,

Ice skating will run until the end of
February, when it will be disassembled
for the spring season. Regular hours
are Monday, Tuesday and-Thursday 11
am. through 8 p.m.; Wednesday 11
a.m. through 9 p.m.; Friday and
Saturday 11 a.m. through 10230 p.m.;
and Sunday 12 p.m. through 8 p.m.
Admission is_$5 for adults. Wednesday
evenings are $2.50 with your Pitt ID.
Skate rental is $31 For more informa-

There’s a trail in my backyard,E|iza: gym

' ARIEL JOHNS
The Pitt News

Tests, papers and personal prob-
lems sometimes make college stu-
dents crazy. Someone once said the
best remedy for a headache is to burn
off some steam. When "feeling over-
whelmed, doing physical activity is
the best solution.

The most likely of places to do
this would be one of the campus
gyms, right? Well, maybe if signing‘
up touse a treadmill, waiting for an
empty StairMaster or trying to find
your ID is what you like to do. The
gyms are a great. way to relieve stress
and exercise, but having a change in
scenery is sometimes the best solution
for a sound mind.

Only seven minutes away from

Oakland, the Eliza Furnace Trail -—
also known as the “j ail trail” — winds
its way past the-river. The 2 1/2 miles
of smooth concrete, nature and urban
art provide an interesting and distinct
outdoor setting. Starting at either the
Allegheny County Jail or the
Greenfield entrance and
open from dawn till dusk, ’
the Eliza Furnace Trail is
easily accessible.

Unlike the trails in-Schenley Park,

. this trail is smooth the entire way. The

ground is even, preventing roller
bladers from accidents.

Small trees line the trail. This
allows" the sun to shine on you at all
times. Nothing obscures your view of
the sky and the wind brushes against
your face. Perhaps themost striking
sight along the trail is the abundance

of street art. , _
Red, blue and? yellow angular
graffiti tags cover the ‘walls of‘ the

' trail. The artwork provides the perfect
ambience for the . 2 1/2 miles.‘
Observing this graffiti leaves you
wondering how theartists were able

to draw ‘ such life-like
faces, and 'how_,you have
come so far '_without real-
. izing it. p 

In case you become tire__d‘, benches
resting alongside the trail" provide a
spot for respite, andsigns that mark
the distance you have traveled encour-
age you to run that extra last half mile.

The best thing about the Eliza
Furnace Trail is the comforting atmos-
phere. On the path, you are not alone.
You might see women and men on

way to his car. “After work, I can

The Pitt News ’

On Tuesday night around 10:30, the
brick ovens will be ﬁring and the stage
lights will shine slightly different hues of
cool as Fuel & Fuddle hosts Good Brother
Earl, offering up Oakland’s very’ own little
“House of Blues.”

Fronted by a harmonica-slinging Jeff
Schmutz, Good Brother Earl will please a
wide variety of fans with their very own
blend of “roots—rock,” which reﬂects inﬂu-
ences ranging from traditional blues to clas-
sic rock, with a little jazz and bluegrass
thrown into the mix. '

Good Brother Earl takes the proliﬁc
songwriting and emotion—inducing lyrics of
Bob Dylan or U2 and backs them with
solid chord progressions and cleanly
picked arpeggios to render a cross between
Blues Traveler and early R.E.M. It is this
unique and innovative mix that has won
Good Brother Earl critical acclaim from the
musical press, as well as gigs ranging from
the Pittsburgh/Cincirmati area all the way to
the musical nerve centers of Boston and
Nashville. '

The boys from Good Brother. Earl will
be sure to feature a few songs from their
new release, love and Freedom, as well as
staples from their ﬁrst album, Up Against a
Worldwide Illusion. Tracks from the latter

_ that are likely to  performed include

“Always be in Love,” where pianist Skip
Sanders gets funky on the Hammond
organ, while Jeff Schmutz punctuates his
fee1—good lyrics with a harmonica solo
that’s reminiscent of John Popper’s blues
harp work.

The band’s use of instruments like the .

harmonica and organ is a testament to the
versatility of the Pittsburgh—based quintet.
Another song worth mentioning is “South
60 Blue,” which is a great example of the
band’s ‘ftravelin’ 'man” sound with its
windy acoustic guitar and storytelling
lyrics. "

Good Brother Earl shifts gears on a
bouncy f‘Lonely Heart” and a smoothly
strummed “Checking Out.” These songs‘
will surely satisfy acoustic music fans with
their beautiful melodies and introspective
sound. Ever the versatile outﬁt, “Illusion”
offers a taste of good ol’ southern rock with
its. electric power chords and blistering
solo, while the bluesy guitar licks of Paul

Fitzsimmons chase truly soulful piano

work on “Poolhall Venus,” a song sure to
be etched into your musical memory.
Rounding out the band are bassist Dan
Paolucci and drummer Alex Peck. An
ever—present force, the duo provides solid
rhythm and beat to anchor the ensemble.
A truly talented and multifaceted band,

A Good Brother Earl is deﬁnitely one act ‘

tl1at’s sure to be a crowd—pleaser. The band
has a number of upcoming gigs in the
Pittsburgh area, including dates at Fuel &
Fuddle Feb. 5 and 19, Mitchell’s bar and
restaurant Feb. 8 and the Pittsburgh Deli
Co. Feb. 13. VV1th a schedule like that,
there’s no reason not to get out and see
these guys at‘ least once. If you see one
show in Oakland this semester, make it

Panthers’ defense returns in 7 l -5 9
bashing of Villanova Wildcats

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Just three days after giving up a season-high
89 points to N otre Dame, the Panthers returned to
playing their brand of basketball, holding their
opponent under 60 points for the 15th time this
season in a 71-59 victory over Villanova.

“It’s a’ big win because ‘Nova came in_ here
hot,” head coach Ben Howland said. “We’re com-
ing off of adisappointing loss, which increases
your awareness of playing good defense.”

Pitt (19-4 overall, 7-3 Big ’*East) forced 19
Villanova turnovers and moved its record to 14-1
when holding its opposition under 60.

Julius Page led the Panthers with 18 points
and not far behind was Brandin‘ Knight’s 14
points. Knight dished out eight assists, while tum-
ing the ball over just once.

The Panthers got off to a fast start as Page
scored eight of the team’s ﬁrst 12 points. Two deep
three—pointers from Page and a baseline jumper
put Pitt ahead 12-6. p »

Pitt was executing its ﬁerce defense, forcing
several Villanova turnovers early, but a wild

Derrick Snowden three-pointer as the shot clock '

expired kept the Wildcats close at 12-9.

Knight matched Snowden’s prayer with a
three of _his own, but Snowden came right back
with a jumper from the corner, to make it a 15-11
game. '

Jaron Brown, two close-range ﬁeld goals from
Toree Morris and a Chevon- Troutman layup, Pitt
went on a 10-2 run, claiming its largest lead of the
first half, 25-13. .
Pitt appeared to be in the driver’s seat with
just more than four minutes remaining in the ﬁrst

half, but the Wildcatsclawed their way back into

the game as a Donatas Zavackas foul, at the 3:32

gap to 27-21. Villanova made 20-of-21 free throws

Reese signing a good beginning for Littleﬁeld

After trying to stay awake through
too many classes last Tuesday, I returned

After checking numerous sources, I
realized that not only was it true, but the

to my room looking for something to Pirates had actually beaten out another

wake me up.

By the way, if professors
didn't make us do it, would
anyone ever read some of the
books we have to buy?

Once in my room, I
turned on the television,
hoping to catch an old
episode of “NFL Films,”
when I got the biggest sports
surprise since Mike Tyson  ”
bit Evander Holyﬁeld  spun-I-3 VI:-W
twice.

The Pirates and second
baseman Pokey Reese had

Joe Marchilena

  

agreed on a two-year con-

tract, pending a physical. T team.

team to sign Reese.

When was the last time

from another team? Has that
ever even happened before?

Did his agent tell him with
whom he was signing? Did
anyone tell him just how
bad the Pirates were last
year?

Maybe general manag-
er David Littlefield dis-
guised himself, tricking
Reese into thinking he was
going to sign with another

the Pirates stole a free agent ’

And what about Reese? I

I could not believe what I saw; it had
to be a mistake. They must have meant
Reece Davis or perhaps Gumby’s horse,
Pokey. No way could it have been the
same guy who won two Gold Gloves
and was considered so valuable the Reds
wouldn’t trade him for Ken Griffey Jr.

That must have been it.

Or maybe this is what baseball will
be like in Pittsburgh now that Littleﬁeld
is in charge. Maybe he really is serious
about putting a competitive team on the
ﬁeld. Cam Bonifay sure wasn’t.

By the way, what ever happened to

Ed Sprague? Hard to believe he was the
Pirates’ All-Star representative in 1999.
All right, so maybe Reese isn’t the
biggest of free agents. His numbers have
i been on the decline for the last two years
and there must be a reason this is his
fourth team in about six weeks.

But it is huge for the Pirates. With
the exception of Brian Giles, when was
the last time the Pirates successfully
ﬁlled a hole in their lineup?

Signing Reese did just that. While
there were plenty of holes in the Pirates’
lineup last season, second base was one
of the biggest; ’

Instead of trying to ﬁx the problem
from within, like Bonifay had tried to do
so many times before, Littleﬁeld went
out and picked up someone who has
actually been successful at the major
league level.

Not only was this a big step in mak-
ing the 2002 Pirates a little more com-
petitive, but it also helps to erase the
memories of last off-season’s horren-
dous free agent signings.

Picking up two players whose com-

bined age is about! as old as Fort Pitt was
not a step in the right direction. —

Terry Mulholland went on the dis-
abled list within the first week of the sea-
son and Derek Bell’s batting average
was a joke. The fact that Bell has a shot

at‘ making this yea_r’s team is even more,

stupefying. \

Remember how excited Mulholland
was about ﬁnishing his career in
Pittsburgh? It almost makes you feel bad
for the guy. .

Of course, come April, none of this
might matter. Reese could get hurt, Giles

or Jason Kendall might be traded or-

Littleﬁeld could’ decide that manager
Lloyd McClendon’s base stealing days
are over and show him the door.

Or the Pirates.could shock us all and
snap their streak of nine losing seasons
in a row. _

That would deﬁnitely surprise this

sports fan more than hearing how Tyson

took a bite out of Lennox Lewis’ leg.

Pitt picks up win No. 19 in frontof sold—outcrowd

On ‘track, page 14

back to get his team to within one.

The 11-0 Villanova run cut Pitt’s
lead to 27-26 going into halftime.

Buchanan, who is averaging 19.2
points on the season, was held to just
four ﬁeld goal attempts in the ﬁrst half
as Page held him to four points.

“I was just trying to limit his touch-
es and crowd him, so that he had to
shoot over me,” Page said. “I wasn’t
going to let him get the ball easily.”

6 Villanova quickly carried its
momentum into the second half, as
Buchanan quickly shot a long ﬁeld goal
to give Villanova its first lead of the
game, 28-27.

Villanova’s lead was short-lived,
though, as Brown found a slashing
Knight for a lay-in, putting Pitt back on
top. Two Sullivan free throws tied the
game for Villanova at 33, but Pitt pulled
ahead again as Chad Johnson came off
the bench to hit a three-pointer. I

Pitt, who Howland had accused of
being ﬂat in the ﬁrst half, surely woke
up when Johnson found Ontario Lett
underneath for an enthusiastic one-
handed dunk. The play gave Pitt a 38-
33 lead, bringing the sold-out
Fitzgerald Field House crowd to its
feet.

Knight, who had called to the
crowd to get up, followed Lett’s play
with a turnaround jump shot in the lane
as the tongue-waving Knight put Pitt
ahead 40-33.

Four straight points from

Villanova’s Ricky Wright cut the lead to

43-39, but Pitt quickly ended all

Villanova hopes as it went on a 20-6
run. ‘

Although he was outrnatched by six
inches, Brown used his body to pull
down a rebound over 6-foot-10-inch
Brooks Sales and put back the rebound
while drawing a foul. He completed the
three-point play with a free throw,
putting Pitt ahead 46-39.

“I didn’t really think that I’d make
the shot but I knew that I was going to
get fouled,” Brown «said.

Zavackas followed with two con-
secutive shots from behind the arc,
which led to the climax of the game. Up
54-43, Page and Knight hooked up for
an amazing alley-oop in which Page
leaped from outside the paint, grabbed
the lob from high above the rim and
threw it down with authority.

“Big plays like that give us momen-
tumand get us going again,” Page said.

Page, whohas averaged 16 points
per game over his past ﬁve games, fol-
lowed his acrobatic stunt with a high-

ﬂying jump shot. An ensuing Knight

steal and layup gave Pitt a 58-43 lead,
en route to the big victory.

“They were outstanding defensive-
ly and they got to every lose ball and
offensive rebound,” Villanova head
coach. Jay Wright said. “They’re for

_real.”

Pitt returns to play at the Field

‘House this Thursday, when it hosts

Seton Hall at 9 p.m. The game will be
nationally televised on ESPN.

Brown wanted revenge.

Staff Writer

Pitt and Villanova played a close game on Saturday.
For 25 minutes, that is.

Sparked by an Ontario Lett dunk, the Panthers pulled
away from the Wildcats in their 71-59 victory Saturday.

After a sluggish ﬁrst half, Pitt opened the second with-
out much emotion or intensity. But in a span of six minutes
and seven seconds, ﬂie Panthers put the pesky Wildcats
away. '

With Pitt leading only 36-33, Lett took a Chad
Johnson feed from under the hoop and slammed the ball
down with one hand, igniting the crowd of 6,798.

Julius Page then had a block resulting in a Brandin

- Knight fast—break layup to extend the lead to seven. Knight

was excited as he pumped his lists in the air, daring the
Wildcats to try and score again. Villanova coach Jay
Wright then called a timeout to calm his players down, but
that only fed the Panther frenzy.

“They play hard,” Wright said. “They have very few
weakness.”

After two quick shots by Villanova to cut the lead to
40-37, Knight answered with a three-pointer.

Villanova’s second leading scorer, Ricky Wright, then
connected on two foul shots after a J aron Brown foul. But

In the ensuing possession, the 6-foot-4-inch Brown
soared over 6-foot-10 inch Brooks Sales for a reverse
layup and the foul. Brown made the foul shot to the
crowd’s delight to extend ﬂie lead to 46-39.

“I just try to let them know I’m there,” Brown said on
how he rebounds. “I just use my body.”

 Sales then responded the next possession by battling
for a loose ball and making a layup.

Donatas Zavackas countered by hitting two three-

’ pointers, while Villanova’s leading scorer, Gary Buchanan,

made two free throws, resulting in a 52-43 score.

But Page saw a weakness in the Wildcat defense.

‘The guy who checked me was overplaying me,” he
said “I was telling Brandin all day that he was overplay-
ing me.” '

“Julius was bothering me the entire game. I got tired
of hearing his mou ” Knight joked “I told Chad
[Johnson] to run by Julius and tell him I was going to lob
it.”

Page got his wish.

On the wing, Page received his instructions from
Johnson, slipped by his defender and leapt at least two feet
outside the paint to receive the back-door pass from
Knight. While Page soared through the air, Fitzgerald
Held House was silent as the crowd gawked in disbelief.

Big plays in second half, Page alley-oop lead to Pitt win

“I surprised myself a little,” Page said. “I guess I was
kind of high.”

The play did not surprise head coach Ben Howland,
though.

“We see that in practice everyday,” he said

The next time down the court, Page hit a 14-foot
jumper on the wing.

All throughout the season, he has been the team’s best
defender,_but lately he has been the team’s clutch player,
averaging 16 points for the past ﬁve games.

“In the beginning of the year, I wasn’t forcing
myself,” Page said. “But after the game against Notre
Dame, I took it upon myselfto be aggressive and to do my
part”

Knight then scored on a fast break after forcing one of
his four steals in the game, making the score 58-43, Pitt’s
largest lead up to that point

There were doubts that the Panthers might let up after
the disappointing loss to Notre Dame last Wednesday. But
Knight never felt that way. .

“It’s a testament to our team,” he said, “the way we
bounced bac ” '

Howland agrees with Knight and attributes the team’s
resilience to him. _

“They’ve been good about bouncing back,” he said
“It starts with Brandin in the locker room, though.”
