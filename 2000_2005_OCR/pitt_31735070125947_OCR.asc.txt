Reproductive Freedom's rally last and CWO’s night.

Last night amid honks and‘ chants, a
young woman stood at the foot of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, a solemn expression on her face.
In her raised hand she held a wire clothes
hanger and other hangers littered the side-

walk behind her.

“The hanger represents the way women
induce abortions when they don’t have access
to adequate health care,” said La’Tasha
Mayes, legislative director of the Pitt group
Students for Reproductive Freedom.

At a rally and candlelight vigil last night,
Students for Reproductive'Freedom teamed
with the Campus Women’s Organization for a
memorial to women who died as a result of
illegal abortions. R .

The rally coincided with the sixth annual
National Young Women’s Day of Action, a
nationwide event designed to focus attention
on Women’s reproductive options and rights.
The day commemorates the death ‘of Rosie
Jimenez, a college student who died as a
result of an illegal abortion.

“We’re not here because we’re anti-
church or anti-life,” Mayes said. “We’re here
to reiterate that no one has a right to tell
women what to do with our bodies.” C

Young women and a handful of young
men lined Fifth Avenue in front of St. Paul’s
waving signs and chanting slogans such as
“honk if you’re pro-choice.” '

The two groups chose to demonstrate
there in response to a temporary memorial
titled “Memorial to the Unborn” that the
church displayed in honor of National
Respect For Life Month. The memorial con-
sisted of small ‘white crosses, each represent-
ing the lives of 10 aborted fetuses.

“I was repulsed by the crosses,” said
Students for Reproductive Freedom President
Courtney Ehrlichman. “We couldn’t just let
itgo.”

The group gathered at the base of St.
Paul’s as Students for Reproductive Freedom
and CWO officers spoke about reproductive
freedom. According to Mayes, Pennsylvania
ranked 48th in a nationwide survey regarding

Social work students meet and greet at mixer

TAI SAUNDERS
‘The Pitt News

For more than 100 students, staff and

- faculty, there was no better place to be

sociable last night than the School of

- Social Work..

The school held its armual informal
mixer, packing the ballroom of the

- William Pitt Union.

“This is the one time of the year

' where we can pause to celebrate and
- communicate and meet one another in a

different forum,” said Dr. Grady H.

v Roberts Jr., the school’s associate dean of
» admissions and student affairs.

In true celebratory spirit Roberts
hopped from one table to another greet-
ing students from the school’s bachelor’s,
master’s and Ph.D. programs. Roberts
plarmed and organized the function with
the help of his staff, including doctoral

_ student Christine Smith, who served as

project coordinator.

As students and faculty slowly trick-
led in from their classes and packed the
room, the laid-back atmosphere trans-

formed into an. "all-out party, the denim

jeans and sneakers of the students inter-
twining with the suit pants and polished
patent leather shoes of the faculty and
staff. -
Harold Betters and his band ﬁlled the
air with a mixture of jazz, R&B and rock,
performing classic songs such as “What a
Wonderful‘ World,” “Unforgettable” and
“The Lady is a Tramp.” ‘

Professors and students sat togeﬂier

at circular tables covered with white
linens, dining on an array of ﬁnger foods
and casually chatting about topics rang-

‘ing from classes to upcoming concerts.

Those not sitting meandered around
the room, mingling with people they
already knew and introducing themselves
to those they didn’t. Aurora Jackson, a

professor in the master’s program,
seemed to draw attention from everyone
as she introduced herself and shook
hands with everyone at each_table.

J ackson, who arrived from Columbia
University in January, said she felt the
idea of the mixer was a good one.

“I think the students want to meet the

“professors,” she said. . -

Tracey Fleming, a_ master’s student
who will graduate in December, agreed
with the concept of the ﬁmction.

“It’s nice to see professors on .a

friendlier level, outside of the class-

room,” she said.

The school’s diversity became evi-
dent as the room ﬁlled with people of dif-
ferent age groups and ethnicities.

‘"I‘here’s ages from 18 to .60, and
every color of the rainbow,” said Shawn
Mincer, a continuing education student.

Halfway through the event, Roberts
presented plaques to staff members Mary

Pat Elhattab and Barbara Proviano in
recognition of their outstanding service

to the school’s students.

The mixer also gave the school’s
new dean, Larry Davis, an informal way
to interact with faculty and students. For
the ﬁrst hour of the event, Davis walked
around with a cup of fruit punch in one

‘hand, shaking hands at each table.

Davis, who arrived here in August
from Washington University in St. Louis,
said he felt that the school’s effort to
unify the students and faculty was
impressive.

“They didn’t have [mixers] like this
at Washington University,” Davis said.

Davis closed the event byvdrawing
names for the door prizes awarded to stu-
dents. The door prizes were a student
membership to the National Association
of Social Workers, a $30 gift certiﬁcate to
Red Lobster and the grand prize, tickets
to a Steelers vs. New York Jets game.

Heather Kiraly researched AIDS
awareness among Brazilian teen-agers.

Lyrme Sunderman and her family
lived with the Zapaistas in Mexico.

These Pitt students and 32 others won
Nationality Rooms Summer Study
Abroad scholarships. They shared their
stories in a debrieﬁng Wednesday
evening.

Students spoke of their trips and their

' most memorable experiences while there.
- Most students said that they improved

their language skills and were able to get a
taste of the culture. Clinton Illar spent his
time with a French host family, studying
French and exploring Paris.

Since 1948, more than 700 scholar-
ships and faculty grants have been award-
ed to University undergraduate and gradu-
ate students. Wirmers of the scholarships
and grants can then spend at least ﬁve
weeks of their summer studying in anoth-
er country. ‘

Dave J ortner spent his summer study-
ing Japanese theater.

“Of the three playwrights I’m now
writing on,” Jortner said, “I was able to
meet and interview two of them.”

These students also spent their time
working on research projects and/or
studying the language and culture of the

country they went to. The summer study
abroad program is open to students with a
wide variety of majors and interests.
Kiraly seized the opportunity of going
abroad to study AlDS awareness in Brazil.
She studied the country’s level of AIDS

‘ awareness, the differences among social

classes and she interviewed patients and
physicians. _ -

While all of the students agreed that
their time abroad was well-spent and
enjoyed, a few admitted that there was the
possibility of danger. One student was 300
meters of away from a police station that
was bombed by terrorists. Despite situa-
tions like this, there were no real problems
and students, on the whole, felt safe while
abroad.

E. Maxine Bruhns, the director of
Nationality Rooms and intercultural
exchange programs, is trying to encourage
Pitt students to apply for the scholarships.
Eligible students include sophomores and
juniors who hold at least a 3.0 QPA and
will be returning for at least two semes-
ters.

Each student is awarded a set amount
of scholarship or grant money from one of
the University Nationality Rooms or open
grants. This summer the program hopes to
send 39 students abroad.

For interested and eligible students, a
list of scholarship and grant possibilities
will be available after Thanksgiving break

Journalists talk shop at Career Day

TRAVIS REAL
Staff Writer

The reporter. The editor. The political
writer. The “twhie.” The public relations
man. ‘

All ﬁve of these people came together
yesterday to talk about their ﬁelds at the 9th

armual Career Day, sponsored by the
English department, The Pitt News, Career '

and Placement Services and WPTS.

This year’s keynote speakers were
KDKA reporter Kelly Frey; Newsweek
national correspondent Lynette Clemetson;
Torn Chakurda, public relations and market-
ing manager for Allegheny General
Hospital; Dan Bates, editor of the Small
Business News and Tom Rozgonyi, assis-

, tant technology systems editor of the

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. They introduced
themselves and had a panel discussion with
students and faculty.

One student asked what path he should

taketobeajoumalist.

“There is no path,” Clemetson said.
“Your path is what you decide to carve out
for yourself.” »

Bates disagreed, saying ‘Two traits that
are essential for a person in this ﬁeld are
inquisitiveness and. the ability to learn things
quick1y._’’ -

Bates spoke of working for the
Pittsburgh Business Times. He had the high-
er technology beat, which at the time was the
least covered. ~

“I knew nothing about technology but
you can be sure that I learned quickly,” Bates
said

_ ‘ The. panelists discussed paths to
employment. Internships were on the top of
the list. Frey suggested that students take
advantage of all the internship possibilities
that are offered in this area. .

Rozgonyi added that all jobs could lead
to a career. ‘ - p ’

“There are no small jobs,” he said. “As
strange as it might sound, it’s  to be
good at every job.” He added that he was a
bank teller before he started working for
papers. His computer knowledge led him
from a bank teller to assistant technology
systems editor at the Post-Gazette.

Getting a job never guarantees security.
The speakers talked about the precarious job‘
market I
“You shouldn’t let the job market scare
you but you should research what company
is laying off employees,” Clemetson said.

Chakurda added another piece of
encouragement: “It’s hellﬁre out there,” he
said. “[But] with luck and preparation you
can do it.”

In addition to the panel discussion, there
was an annual presentation of the Al

McDowell Award for a prominent student

reporter. This year’s recipient was Pitt News
Managing Editor Elizabeth Bowen. , _

The afternoon ended with a ceremony
honoring Patsy Sims, head of the nonﬁction
writing department

Arm the public with information

Congress is in recess until Tuesday. Five
people nationwide have conﬁrmed cases of
anthrax. More than 30 people were exposed

‘ to anthrax in the Capitol Building. Saturday,

there weretwo phone calls threatening the
release of anthrax in the William Pitt Union

and Hillman Library, causing the evacuation ,

of much of lower campus. E-mail messages
—— many conﬁrmed hoaxes — ﬂood our in-

boxes warning us not to venture certain

places, such as malls on Halloween.
Nonetheless, Bush is in China on his
ﬁrst trip outside tl1e_ nation since Sept. 11.
The Emmys were rescheduled for Nov. 4th.
Roughly 52,000 people attended Pitt’s
homecoming game on Saturday. _ ' _
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, life has been
ﬁlled with mixed messages. On one hand,

\ signs indicate that life goes on. On the other,

bioterrorism may threaten our way of life
and open society. As Americans, we don’t
know quite how to feel or how to act.

_ Clearly, widespread panic is not the
answer. As college students and as citizens,
we need a grand plan. Oﬂicials from‘ the
chancellor to Homeland Security Director
Tom Ridge and President Bush need to out-_
line clear and direct policies and plans for
how local and national security is being han-
dled N 1 .

At the national level, A former
Pennsylvania govemor Ridge now oversees
more than 40 agencies with overlapping and
competing responsibilities. Public knowl-
edge that various agencies have not worked
together in the past and that policies and

practices are not streamlined contributes to
the national panic.

While the public does not need to know
every detail of national intelligence, it would
be comforting to have a clear outline of
national‘ policy and procedures. How con-
cerned should the general public be about
anthrax in their mail? How afraid should we
be of renewed terrorist attacks and on what
scale? -

Similarly, local authorities must clarify
their response measures. Sat11rday’s con-
fusedresponsetothecarnpus anthraxthreat
clearly demonstrated a need‘ for Pitt to detail
a course of action.

Additionally, Pitt and city police need to
work together to formulate response plans
andshare information. The fact that neither
force will claim responsibility for the donn
evacuation indicates miscommunication
between the two at the very least.

A memorandum regarding mail han-
dling ﬁom Jerome Cochran, executive vice
chancellor, should serve as a model for other
University officials and for the dispersal of
information nationwide. The memorandum,
which was addressed to Pitt deans, directors
and department chairs, clearly outlined what
indicators University personnel should look
for and what steps to take regarding suspi-
cious letters and parcels.

This sort of forwardness and clear how-
to information aids people in the search for
balance. Armed with information, people
know when and what to fear, as well as how
to behave in order to keep themselves safe

Showing some skin and preparing  

for the pages of Playboy  

Typically, I dread getting my mail

— sky-high credit card bills and paying

But in early September I was quite
excited when I saw that magical piece

_ One could argue that a lot of the
girls who got to Pitt - actually are hot
enough to be in Playboy, but that I just
haven’t seen them naked. This is true.
I’m hoping next year Playboy will
prove me wrong by doing a “Girls of

ence photo shoot, Playboy
does a spread on the colleges
with the most beautiful girls

of the reasons I’m short "of
a girlfriend right now, but that’s a total-
ly unrelated story. '

The reason I was particularly inter-
ested in the pictures this month was

because of the theme, “Girls of the '
“SEC.” Every year, Playboy does a sec-

tion featuring nude photos of girls who
attend the colleges of -that conference.
It’s usually widely publicized around
college campuses and tons of pretty
girls line up and shed their clothes in
hopes of getting their big modeling
breaks.

As I was perused the issue and
noticed how hot all the girls were, I
couldn’t help but think that I either went
to the wrong school or that all the girls
who are Playboy material hide it very
well in class. I’m not saying everyone
who goes here is ugly. And while I’m
not one with room to criticize, I feel like

and best party schools.

Now, we’re not going to prove our-
selves if we go around dressing like
we’re hung over the day after a party.

Girls — from now on and until that
glorious day when Pitt finally makes
Playboy, I want to see you in miniskirts
or something equally revealing at all
times.

And seeing as how Playboy doesn’t
rate guys, it doesn’t matter -what you
guys wear. But it is still your job to
make the girls look as hot as possible
and contact the Playboy people to make
them aware of our beautiful student
body. Or should I say students’ bodies.
And girls: don’t be afraid to show a lot
of skin. Obviously, Playboy frowns on
girls who are clothed. So next time you
need to get changed, do it in a roomful

Coming to college, reliving girl scout camp

My first encounter with college felt like sum-
mer camp. Totally independent for the first time
and surrounded by my peers, I felt like

day my roommates and I wax philosophically
about the work we have and the improbability that
it will ever get done.

I stepped back 10 years to my first time ’
at girl scout camp — but with indoor
plumbing and more beer.

My only real experience of being
away from home came from my weeks
at summer camp, and at first I could
see little difference in college life.
With minimal responsibility, my life
consisted mainly of making new
friends and trying to have a good time.
After being warned by all my teachers

I enjoy the added bonus of living
with masters of procrastination. The
night begins with typical distractions —

that college would be a challenge, I
was free to act like a giddy kid. -

I actually felt a little guilty for having so much
fun. Because I was attending classes that cost more
than scientists would be willing to pay for my
entire body, I didn’t think I should be enjoying
myself so much. If I were just looking for a good
time, I could have bought a tent and hit the road
with a couple of buddies for less than a few
months worth of plasma.

But as the initial shock of independence wore
off, my perspective of college life underwent a lit-
tle revision. I realized that professors expect more
than just to see my shining face in class. They
want things like homework. And essays. And
midterms.

Now that I’ve settled into the college routine,
stress is a permanent fixture in my, dorm. Every

As the hours drag on, conversation becomes
more interesting. It’s nice to have roommates who

are also sitting dazed at the computer. Then you

can at least talk unintelligibly with other humans.
When I turned in early one night, leaving my
roomie to fend for herself, I swear I heard her mut-
tering to no one that she would spank herself for
her stupidity. Fortunately, I was not awake long
enough to see her follow through on that one.

But while I’m enjoying the late-night bonding-

and stupid pranks of university. life, I’m finding

‘L.|.E.’ is edgy, liberal  

L.|.E.

Directed by Michael Cuesta

STEVE CAPANNA
Staff Writer

For a 15-year-old, Howie has a lot going on in his

I life. His mother recently died in a car accident on the

Long Island Expressway — Ll.E., his father, instead of
grieving, spends his time loudly having sex with anoth-
er woman and trying to avoid being sent to federal
prison for embezzlement, and Howie is developing a
crush on his best friend, Gary.

So begins “L.I.E.,” and things don’t get any easier
for Howie in this 21st "century coming of age story.
Soon, Gary convinces him to rob the house of Big John
Hemy, a 60-year-old pedophile who occasionally pur-
chases sexual favors from Gary. When Gary leaves
town, Howie is left to deal with Big John and the reper-
cussions of the robbery.

The various images of socially unacceptable sex
that surround him complicate Howie’s search for his
own sexual identity. His father sleeps with another
woman far too soon after his wife dies, his friend dis-

, cusses having sex with his own sister. and his relation-

ship with Big John, altemately paternal and lecherous,
escalates.

Despite the interesting and daring —-— especially for
an American movie —— story line, ﬂie reason this movie
excels is the performances given by Brian Cox as Big

John, and Paul Franklin Dano as Howie. Cox plays a
sick, twisted character without resorting to lascivious
mannerisms, beyond when he is explicitly discussing
sex: he claims to give the best fellatio in the tri-state area,
which explains his license plate, “BJ.”

He is land, reasonable and giving, except for when
it comes to his sexual desires. At one point, he sings
“Darmy Boy” beautifully, a scene both moving and
haunting. Cox is likable and sympathetic as a child
molester, and the audience often empathizes with him,
momentarily forgetting his nauseating sexual transgres-
srons.

Dano also is fabulous. He gives a subtle, layered
performance, playing his likely homosexual character
with more dignity than most adult actors give when they
play gay roles. Howie’s extreme intelligence, demon-
strated when he speaks French, quotes Whitman and

writes his own poetry, is believable coming from Dano, .

but he manages to remain innocent

His ﬂirtations with Big John are alternately amus-
ing and disturbing, especially because it appears that he
doesn’t quite understand the potential implications of

his actions. Considering this is only Dano’s second ﬁlm, '

and his first starring role, he is phenomenal.

’ “LIE.” is an independent movie at its best. Edgy,
liberal and well-acted, it treats homosexuality and
pedophilia as just another topic, not as taboo subjects we
mustn’t discuss. Some convenient plot twists and
bizarre choices by characters are the only things that
hold this ﬁlm back from its potential, but the ending is
startling and masterful. , ‘

“LIE.” masterfully achieves the extremely diﬂ'1-
cult task of portraying a gay adolescent without alienat-
ing a mainstream audience.

Ode to an unlikely
literary giant

In ninth grade, my life plan was
slightly different. Back then, I
wanted to be a doctor, played the
violin in the school orchestra and
participated in the debate team. My
high school ran a Vo-Tech-style
beauty school, and this world apart
from honors classes and the same
50 people I saw class after class
intrigued me.

One day, I was struck by the
idea that I would quit the school
orchestra and start beauty school. A

Pourquoi?

Leslie Hoffman

 

la “Grease,” I imagined myself

working in a slick, futuristic beauty salon surrounded by
singing ladies in silver salon capes and sparkly rollers.
Men would fall at my feet when they realized I could stitch
up hearts in one hand while I set rollers with another.

I rationalized this decision to my parents by telling
them that by the time I graduated from high school I could
pay my way through medical school by working in a beau-
ty salon. For some reason, they did not appreciate this idea,
and I returned to my dull life plucking out Mozart and
researching argument techniques.

Six years later, the life plans have changed again, and I

involve slightly less intriguing and fantastic realities than
the aforementioned musical beauty salon. But I think I’ll
survive. .

David Sedaris, one of my heroes, seems like he must
have had similar fantasies while he was in high school.

Sedaris, who writes exaggerated autobiographical short.

stories on his amazingly wacky childhood and his migra-
tory adult life, is speaking at the Byham Theater on
Sunday.

I wonder if he will tell the story about the time his sis-
ter brought home a hooker for Christmas, or the time he
worked in an insane asylum. Perhaps he’ll discuss his
adventures as a department store elf, the time he hitch-
hiked across the country with a paraplegic, or some of his
escapades in France. .

Sedaris’ life amazes me. He claims that all of his sto-
ries are truly autobiographical, even if they are grossly
exaggerated. He’s not that old, but when I try to put togeth-
er a time line of his life, it seems like he must have to be
almost 100 to have experienced everything he has. He’s
lived in North Carolina, Chicago, on the West Coast and
now France. He wentto art school but held tons of odd
jobs; he’s been a house painter and a department store elf,
"and he claims that the one thing in the world that he can do
better than anything else is reﬁnish furniture.

Despite the fact that Sedaris’ stories reveal he wasn’t
the smartest kid in class, that he was probably pretty
annoying when he was little and that his nomadic life of
his inability to keep a “normal” job carried him all over the
United States —- and now Europe —— it makes me feel that
even if my plans fall through, some potential for success
will always remain.

Sedaris will deny it, but anyone who ever laughed out
loud while listening to him read on NPR or while reading
“Me Talk Pretty One Day,” or “Naked,” will agree he has
succeeded. Perhaps that’s the best plan of all: just let life
happen.

. (412) 261-2221,

For those of you still undecided about
whether to don white face paint or the
“Scream” mask for Halloween this year,
consider this costume alternative: a
Mexican wrestling mask. o

These Mexican masks became the
trademark symbol for the surf-rock band
Los Straitjackets. VV1th their latest album
out on Yep Roc Records titled Sing Along

with Los ~Straizjackets, the Straitjackets

have taken a new approach to their previ-
ously instrumental style ...i by adding
lyrics. ‘ '

But in this album, their fifth, they do ,

not yet reveal the sound of their voices,
for not once on the album do any of the
members of Los Straitjackets sing.
Rather, in each of the 13 tracks, a differ-
ent guest singer provides vocals while the
Straitjackets’ classic sound does more
than justice to the we]l—chosen songsthey
cover. ‘ '

and catchy bass line will have you ‘singing

 ‘musician ‘Big Sandy‘ Will

accompany‘ the Straitjackets on their tour.

Big Sandy sings the albums’ second tune, '
5‘Ta1lahassee Lassie,” and another song
called “Mother-in—Law,_” both sung in

' . Spanish. On tour, Big Sandy will provide

vocals for many of the songs on the new
set list in the absence of the large list of
guest vocalists who took part in the origi-
nal recording. ‘

Another guest, Leigh Nash of
Sixpence None _the Richer, joins the
Straitj ackets in a cover of “The End of the
World.” Nash’s strong but soothing voice
complements the Straitjackets’ easygo-
ing, casual style. ‘ The soft sounds of
brushes on the drum set and gentle hum-
ming of Nash, followed by beautiful vio-
lin andstring. solos make this song, musi-
cally, one ‘of the best on the album.

The album’s other guest vocalists
include the Reverend Horton Heat, Exene
Cerven_ka of Los Angeles punk groupX’s
and Mike _ Campbell from ‘ the
Heartbreakers in tunes that continue the
Straitjacket’s ‘60s soundwith riffs remi-
niscent of “Vlripeout” and “Johnny B

Pitt goes to battle in Beantown

MATT WEIN
Staff Writer

Lately it seems that the Pitt football pro-
gram has been on the losing end of nearly
everything. But one thing in Pitt’s (1-4, 0-2
-in the Big East) favor is that it leads the all-
time series against Boston College (4-2, 2-1
in the Big East). Tomorrow, Pitt will meet the
Eagles in their armual Big East showdown.

While the Panthers are ahead in the
ongoing series 13-12, Boston College won
three of the previous four meetings: The lone
exception was last year at Three Rivers
Stadium, when Pitt won 42-26, racking up
584 yards of total offense.

The Panthers enter this contest having
lost four straight games, their only win com-
ing in the season opener against Division II-
A East Tennessee State.

While the Panthers have traditionally
played well against Boston College, they
have not won atAlurrmi Stadium since 1989.

Not all of the Pitt wins were blowouts.
Four of the last ﬁve games between ﬂrese
two teams were decided by eight points or
less.

Boston College carries with it a potent,
quick-strike offense, led by junior running
back William Green. Green leads the Big
East in rushing and is the ﬁfth-ranked rim-
nin_g back in all of collegiate football. He has
achieved 100 yards on the ground in every

game this season except last week’s against
Virginia Tech. So far this season, he has run
for 787 yards and eight touchdowns.

The Eagles also carry with them _a fast
and diverse passing game, showcasing quar-
terback Brian St. Pierre. St Pierre has
thrown 14 touchdowns this season and only
four interceptions. '

Like ﬂre Panthers, the Eagles are deep at
wide receiver. Their passing game features
three good wide outs in Dedrick Dewalt,
Ryan Read, and Jamal Burke.

Last week, the Boston College offense
scored 20 points against Virginia Tech’s
defense; a defense that had allowed only 24
points all season prior to last week’s game.

Pitt is coming off of a disappointing Big

East loss to Syracuse. The Panthers must win '

this week to keep any realistic hopes of a
bowl appearance alive. '

This week’s game could very well be
decided by Pitt’s defense. If the defense can
contain Green and the secondary can play
adequately against the BC passing " game,
then the Panthers will have a chance to pick
up a much needed win.

If the defense is ineﬁective, the Pitt
offense will be forced to score to stay com-
petitive. That would require strong perfor-
mances from the offensive line and quarter-
back This being said, and given the recent
play of the Pitt offense, it is imperative for
the defense to play well if ﬂue team hopes to

Trying to break the Eagles’ defense will
be Antonio Bryant. In Bryant’s two‘ career
games against the Eagles, he has averaged
nine catches and 179 receiving yards.

Ramon Walker, who leads the team“

with 73 tackles, leads Pitt’s defense. Walker

had seven last week against Syracuse, which
moved him past Randy Holloway, for 13th
place on Pitt’s career tackles list ‘ -

Pitt’s defense gave up 172 rushing yards
last week to the Orangemen and will have to

buckle down if it wants to beat Green and the A ‘

Eagles.

This season marks the .103rd year of the Boston ’

College football program. In 1891, then-president of
Boston College, Edward I. Devitt gave the students per-
mission — but no money —— to organize a football team.

Joseph F. O’Donnell, a local native and alumnus
with amateur football experience, agreed to help orga-
nize the team. The team played a schedule of informal
games the following year, but did not ‘begin a formal
schedule until 1893.

The Boston College football team picked up its ﬁrst
win in its ﬁrst formal game, a 4-0 defeat of St. John’s
Institute (at the time, touchdowns were scored four
points rather than six).

The football team played until 1900, when W.G.
Read Mullan, the president of the college refused to let
the team play under the school’s 'narne any longer. The

students formed an independent team called the “Boston.

Combination.” The following year the team was rein-
stated at the instruction of Mullan.

It wasn’t long before the team met further resistance
that threatened its existence. Much of the public believed
that collegiate football was too violent. The football pro-

gram at BC was discontinued in 1903, and would not
return until 1908.

Following a summit at the White House where
President Theodore Roosevelt met with the leaders of
college football about tightening rules and making the
game less violent, the team was reinstated.

In 1920, the team adopted the “Eagles” nickname,
and lead by second year coach and future college foot-

ball Hall-'of—Farner Frank Cavanaugh, ﬁnished the sea-
son with a perfect 8-0 record. It was the ﬁrst time in the A

tearn’s history that the team went undefeated.
The 1940 season was -arguably the best in the histo-
ry of Boston College football. The Eagles went a perfect

11-0 and went on to play Georgetown in the Sugar Bowl. ,

The Georgetown team had not lost a game in three years

when the teams on Nov. 16th. The Eagles were able to »

defeat Georgetown 19-18, with a safety as time expired.

The bowl game win gave Boston College its ﬁrst

National Championship. ‘
Even the drama and excitement of that season can-

not be bested by what occurred on Nov. 22, 1983 at g

In what came to be know as the most famous three
seconds in Boston College football history, Eagles’ quar-
terback Doug Flutie threw a 48-yard “Hail Mary” that

Flutie “Hail Mary” just one markin BC history

landed in the hands of wide receiver Gerald Phelan as
time expired, to win the game by a score of 47-45. _
Flutie won the Heisman Trophy the following week
and the Eagles defeated Houston in the Cotton Bowl to
cap off one of the most memorable seasons in their his-

tory. ' I

Syracuse becomes

MICHAEL HAMIDI
Staff Writer

With West Virginia, undefeated
Miami (5-0 overall, 2-0 Big East) and
Virginia Tech (6-0, 3-0) getting the
weekend off, the Big East slate is light.
Syracuse plays Temple in a game that
could make Syracuse bowl—eligible and

Rutgers takes on non-conference oppo- '

nent Navy.

Temple (2-3,.l-1) at.Syracuse (5-2, 2-
0) .

Both teams are coming off of vic-
tories against conference teams. The
Orangemen won their last four games
after a tough start. Last week, the
Orangemen turned a 10-7 halftime
deﬁcit into a 42-10 victory over Pitt:

The Owls come offiof a 30-5 vic-

tory over Rutgers last Saturday.’

Temple is ranked 16th in the nation in
total defense and is looking to stop the
Orangemen offense, which is led" by
running back James Mungro. Last
week, the Owls allowed only 32 rush-
ing yards against the Scarlet Knights.
Statistically, Butler High School
graduate Troy Nunes, threw for over

-700 yards this season and started last

week. But Syracuse head coach Paul
Pasqualoni said Nunes’ ‘start last week
was because of R.J. Anderson’s illness.
Anderson will start this week.

Mungro has rushed for 718 yards
this season, making him second in the

conference. Catching Anderson’s pass-
, es will be receivers David Tyree and

Marice Jackson.

On the defensive side for the
Orangemen, Quentin Harris leads the
team with 66 _tackles. The Orangemen
defense leads the Big East with. 26
sacks.

Freshman quarterback ‘Mike
McGann, who threw for 170 yards last
week, runs the Temple offense.
Tanardo Sharps has been Temple’s

most productive tailback.

Last" year, the Orangemen beat the
Temple Owls 31-12 at Veterans stadi-
um. The last time Temple beat
Syracuse was in 1983 when Temple
won 10-9.

Navy (0-5) at Rutgers (1-5, 0-4 Big V

East) .
The Rutgers Scarlet Knights will
try to follow up last week’s debacle
against Temple and break its ﬁve- game
losing streak, when it hosts a bad Navy
team. Rutgers’ only win came in its
opener against Buffalo.

The Navy Midshipmen lost their
first game of the season, losing to Rice,
21-13. Two , of the Midshipmen
starters, defensive tackle Matt Berger
and linebacker Jake Bowen, are out
with injuries.

Quarterback Ryan Cubit leads the
Scarlet Knights offense. Cubit is_ in the
midst of a long learning process as he
has completed 76 out of 166 and has
thrown for 786 yards in this his fresh-
man campaign.

Cubit’s main options on offense
are receivers Delrico Fletcher and L.J.
Smith and running back Dennis
Thomas, who has 291 yards on 74 car-
ries this season.

The Navy defense comes off of a
solid second half performance in which
it held Rice scoreless. Safety Lenter
Thomas led the defense, with a career-
high 14 tackles.

Last week against Rice, it took the
Navy offense a while to start produc-
ing. It wasn’t' until the fourth quarter
that the Navy offense ﬁnally began to
move the ball. Quarterback Brian
Madden and receiver Marlon Terrell
led the late offensive effort.

The Rutgers defense will try to
shut down the Midshipmen with safety
Shawn Seabrooks and linebacker Gary
Brackets. The tandem leads the defense
as Seabrooks has 57 tackles this season
and Brackets has three sacks.

The Knights and Midshipmen have
played each other 16 times. Navy leads
the series 9-6-1. The teams are familiar
with each other, playing seven times in
the last nine years. Rutgers won the
last meeting 28-21 last year at
Annapolis.

Tired of just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance
to make news.

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do
journalism..Come learn about how it’s done, and then consider
actually making history by doing it for the University’s only
independent daily newspaper.

Applications will be available at each talk in case you like
what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just
stop by, learn a little, and talk with the peoplewho already
edit and write the newspaper.
