“Steel tariffs” were the words on the lips
of reporters, protesters and fundraiser guests
as President George W. Bush spoke at the

Westin Convention Center hotel in down-

town Pittsburgh Tuesday morning.
However, Bush -did not say a word
about whether or not he planned to lift steel
tariﬁs in response to pressure from the World
Trade Organization, which has declared that

which is economically and historically

important to Western Permsylvania.

Bush’s remarks did cover a wide vari-
ety of topics, including his plans to continue
America’s war on terror, improve America’s
educational system through his “No Child
Left Behin ” campaign, and end “the soft

bigotry of low expectations.” He

the economy, including “new laws to bring

A fonner Panera Bread Company
employee has ﬁled a, -federal. lawsuit
against the company, claiming he was ﬁred

from‘ its Forbes Avenue store in Oakland _

after allegedly refusing to carry out dis-
criminatory policies set forth by his superi-
ors.

According to the complaint ﬁled by
former employee Paul Anderson, store

owner Sam Covelli expressed displeasure ‘

at seeing African—American employees
”working “out in the open” around April
2003. The complaint says District Manager
Wayne Neuf informed Anderson, who was
a manager at the time, of Covelli’s displea-
sure and urged him to accept Covelli’s
views on the basis that “Sam Covelli owns
the company, "and if that’s what he wants,
that’s what he wants.” - f
Anderson continued to assign_ African-
American employees to work in the dining
room and_ at the registers, and encountered
separate expressions of disapproval from
Neuf, according-to the complaint In one
instance mentioned inthe complaint, Neuf
allegedly told Anderson that if he wanted
to. keep a particular African-American
employee, he would have to“hide her.”
In another instance, Neuf told a diﬂ"er—

ent manager to call  African-American ,-
employee off work because Covelli would ‘

be visiting the store that day, according to
Anderson’s complaint. A .

The document claims that Anderson,
who is white, was eventually ﬁred from the
store “after [he] complained and refused to
discriminate against. African-American
employees,” and that both Covelli and the
Defendant’s management “erigaged_ 

intentional discriminationagainst African- 4: 
American employees and terminated the

Plaintiff solely’ and directly because he

_ would not comply with this directive.” ‘ S ' " 

Panera Bread is one of three retail
stores occupying the ground ﬂoor of Pitt’s
Sennott Square building on Forbes
Avenue. *

_“The University believes strongly in
diversity, and encourages it in its business
partners,” said Pitt; spokesman John Fedele.
“Having said that, the matter in question is
a pending legal issue that does not involve
the University, and we will not offer any
further comment.”

Kevin Murphy, the attorney for the
Defendant, spoke on behalf of his client.

“The company obviously disputes the
allegations,” Murphy said. “The company
believes in diversity and encourages it in its

' workplace.”

Murphy said that, as soon as the inves-
tigation begins, it would be shown that
there has never been and there is no dis-
crimination at Panera. He added that he
thinks the hearing will probably take place

 about nine months.

AIDS Day remembers dead

ISRAEL GUZMAN
Staff Writer

The 16th armual World AIDS Day is an
ongoing tradition that AIDS activists would
like to end soon, but for now, their work will
continue as they try to help people infected
with and at risk for I-IIV/AIDS.

This year’s theme was “Stigma and
Discrimination.” For Monica Higgins, pres-
ident of the Rainbow Alliance, the non-
denominational service held at Heinz
Chapel was designed to urge people at risk
to get tested. It was also done in remem-
brance of those who have died of the disease.

“[It’s] in honor of all those who have
died of HIV/AIDS, and all the people who

are suffering. This year’s theme [is] ‘stigma

and discrimination’ —— speciﬁcally, working
in our community and around the world, to
end the discrimination and the stigma that
goes along with the people that have AIDS,”
Higgins said. '

During the service Monday night, the
more than 100 people in attendance were
invited to write names of loved ones on
name badges and to put them in a “Circle of
Love.” Those in attendance observed a
three—minute silent meditation, and religious
leaders from various faiths read excerpts
from Native American, Islamic and
Buddhist prayers, as well as a few words
once spoken by Gandhi.

According to data from the Center for

Disease Control, diagnoses went up 5.1 per-
cent from 1999 to 2002 in 29 states, after 10
years of declining cases of HIV/AIDS.

The CDC report estimated that 950,000
Americans are HIV—positive and 40,000
become infected each year. Higgins pointed
out these numbers when looking at taming
the epidemic.

“’Ihere’s progress, but also the number
of cases is going up again, so you have to
judge that progressswith the statistics,” she
said. “We feel like we’re getting the word
out, but if more people are being infected,
maybe we’re not doing that good of a jo 

Rainbow Alliance will table in Towers’
Lobby on Thursday, for those who want
more information.

Dr. Charles Rinaldo, head of Pitt Men’s
Study at the Graduate School of Health
spoke of the work done since the study was
granted by the National Institute of Health in
1983, making the study one of the oldest in
the nation. Other schools involved in the
study, or “sister—schools,” as Rinaldo called
them, are the University of California, Johns
Hopkins University, in Baltimore, and
Northwestern University, in Chicago.

“Our study is tracking how you become
infected, and once you are infected, how it
affects your body and causes AIDS, and
how we can learn more about that, which is
critical,” Rinaldo said.

Franklin buff Isaacson shares
stories, modern perspective

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

Walter Isaacson thinks that if Ben
Franklin were alive today, he would proba-
bly be pretty disappointed with the current
state of American politics.

According to Isaacson, Franklin would
be aghast at the divisiveness and partisanship
created by a largely two—party system, as
well as the lack of “pragmatic compromise’?
on issues that affect all Americans, regard-
less of class. .

Isaacson, a former CEO of CNN News
Group and author of the 2003 book
“Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,”
gave his thoughts on the founding father
from a spotlighted podium on stage in thC
Carnegie Museum Music Hall the night of
Nov. 25.

Appearing as one of the Drue Heinz

Lecture Series speakers, Isaacson told a
crowd of 200 people that Franklin’s dedica-
tion to civic projects, such as the founding of
America’s ﬁrst lending libraries, inspired
one of Pittsburgh.’s own great civic philan-
thropists, Andrew Carnegie.
Franklir1’s way with words, however, was
the key to creating his rise to prominence
and establishing how we remember him
today, Isaacson said.

 

NEED A   103?

GREAT PART-TIME HOURS

In the 1720’s, Franklin wanted to join
the Philadelphia chapter of the Freemasons,
but was repeatedly denied membership. In
response, Franklin used his Pennsylvania
Gazette newspaper to publish a series of
exposes revealing the secret codes and hand-
shakes of the society until they eventually let
him join. Franklin then published a series of
retiactions of his own articles.

Franklin’s annual Poor Richard’s
Almanac, which credited authorship to the _
Franklin-penned title character, dispensed\
annual advice ,and infomiation, with the

' promise that if readers didn’t buy that year’s

almanac, Richard’s wife would leave him.

“Franklin was the best writer of the
colonial era — certainly the funniest,”
Isaacson said. “He had a homespun, ‘crack-
er—barrel’ humor that poked fun at the elite
that We see used by other great American
storytellers like Mark Twain, _Will Rogers,
and Garrison Keillor.” _

VV1th a lengthy resume as a scientist,
inventor, diplomat, businessman, politician
and proliﬁc writer, Franklin was the “fore-
most American spokesman of the Age of
Enlightenment,” according to Isaacson.

Friends often told the talented and’

accomplished Franklin that ‘he lacked’humil—

home money to spend, the whole economy
grows, and some people are more likely to
be able to ﬁnd a job,” Bush said. “We’re
returning tax money to the American people
to help them raise their families, reducing
taxes on dividends and capital gains to

' encourage investment.”

Bush also described congressional leg-
islation that would help to create- more choic-
es in Medicare and provide prescription drug
beneﬁts for senior citizens. He also
explained the need for national medical lia-
bility reform, which would cut back on ‘ ‘friv-
olous lawsuits” that increase the cost of
health care and strain the federal budget

. “People who have been harmed by a
bad doc deserve their day in court,” he said,
“yet the system should not reward lawyers
who are ﬁshing for a big settlement.”

Bush also discussed “compassionate

I conservatism” and charity work, including

the USA Freedom Corps’ work  the
United States and America’s efforts to ﬁght
the spread of AIDS in Africa He explained
thatythe foundations for such a compassion-
ate society are grounded in the independence
of ownership. He added that his administra-
tion would work toward increasing minority
home ownership and promoting individual
ownership of businesses, retirement
accounts and health insurance plans. He said
his faith-based initiative would also strength-
en this compassionate environment. '

- “Our government must not fear fai ,”
he said. “We must welcome faith into help-
ing solve the intractable problems that face
our country.” ’

As for Bush’s conspicuously absent
comments on the steel tariffs, White House
spokesman Kevin Madden said that he was-
n’t aware of any speciﬁc reason Bush did not
mention the tariﬂs in his speech. According
to David Sanger of The New York Times,
White House spokespeople said Bush might
not decide until the middle of December.

Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa, also spoke
during Bush’s visit

Bush’s visit to Pittsburgh was part of his
larger Bush—Cheney 2004 fundraising carn-

paign. Inside, the fundraiser guests munched '

on turkey sandwiches and pasta, which came
at the cost of $2,000 a plate. Approximately

_ 425 people attended the fundraiser, and

according to White House spokesman Scott
Stanzel, the event was expected to raise

' $850,000. As of Sept. 30, 2003, about
265,000 donors across the country had con-

tributed a total of $83.9 million.

In contrast to the red, white and blue
tablecloths, the massive American flag and
the attendees’ dark suits inside the conven-
tion center, the approximately 400 protesters
outside created a many—colored, mobile

= group. Among them was an individual

dressed as a clownﬁsh, as well as members
of the Sierra Club, Campus Anti-War
Network and the International Socialist
Organization, who shouted “Give money to

Pittsburgh, not to George W. Bush!” at atten-

Bush describes “compassionate conservatism,” protesters give the slip

dees as they left the ﬁmdraiser. Several Bush
supporters were also stationed outside.

, Between 250 and 300 of the protesters
were members of the United Steelworkers of
America, coming from across Pennsylvania
and parts of Ohio and West Virginia.

“Our message to him is that we expect
him to keep his word,” said Gerald Dickey,
the United ‘Steelworkers spokesman. "The

T tariffs were put up to protect our industry.”

Dickey explained that the 18 months the
tariﬁs have been in effect have given the
American steel industry time to consolidate
and prepare to compete in a foreign market
If Bush keeps the tariffs in elfect for the full
three years, he said, the industry would be
able to complete this preparation process.

“If he takes the tariﬂs away from us,
he’ll pull the rug out from under us,” he
added

Chelsea Quatlrone, a graduate student at
CMU, said that such a move would further
hinder Western Pennsylvanian steel produc-
ers, who are already producing lower quali-
ty steel to olfer competitive prices.

“We’re going to lose our manufacturing
center,” she said “If we lose our manufac-
turing, who will lift us up after another 9-
11?”

Others protested Bush’s ‘tax cuts, the
war in Iraq and what they described as the
threat against civil liberties. Judy Focareta of
Glanshaw, a member of Pittsburgh’s chapter
of Code Pink for Peace, waved a rose—col-

ored piece of women’s lingerie with the
words, “Here’s your pink ‘ slip, George!
You’re ﬁred!” .

“What he has done has taken this coun-
try down so far,” she said, mentioning Iraq, .
the environment and health care. “People
don’t really matter to him It’s a sad time for

‘America and a sad time for this country.”

Tammy Ewin, Pittsburgh police public
information oﬂicer, reported one anest dur-
ing the protests. Anthony Wade Foster, 20,
was anested for running through the protest-
ers, throwing police barricades into the
crowd and knocking over a police bicycle
and breaking one of its lights. He was
charged with disorderly conduct and crirni—
nal mischief.

years ago.

The two sides disagreed about
the impact the amount of increase
— $40 for a full school year —
would have_ on students.

President—elect Kelly and his
supporters agreed that asking stu-
dents to pay the additional money
to support the ongoing program-
ming would not be too much to ask,
especially in_light of the size of the
large tuition increases in recent
years. ,

“It’s not outrageously expen-
sive,” Kelly said earlier in the day.
“How much was tuition raised last
year?”

Morris, who will return as a
board member next semester, said

that, as a full-time student with a‘

job and a student government posi-
tion who receives‘-little financial
help, he equates the increase to two
work shifts.

Since the board has been forced

During the meeting, Culliton said
she was advised by administration
to get it done under the current
board because it takes time fornew
board members to learn the system
and to make a good decision about
what needs to be done.

Many of the board members
were upset about the time frame set
for the res-oluti_on decision.
According to Morris, copies of the

-resolution were not put into their
mailboxes until 3 p.m. Monday,

which gave board members slightly
more than a day to consider the res-
olution and little time to discuss it.

Morley said he was upset that
there was no public notice of the
fee vote. '

Culliton and the board members
who voted for the resolution said
that this was an issue that all board
members knew about. Horstmann

added that it had been mentioned in‘ A

previous meetings.

Awareness and number of cases

rise, testing declines, speaker says

AIDS, page 2

While testing has gone down nation-
wide, the number of AIDS cases has gone
up. 
“Statistics in the papers in the past few
days bear it out that we have to be even more
vigilant in preventing the spread of this
infection,” Rinaldo said, ~“and with those
men and women who are infected, getting
them treatment in this country and certainly
in third world countries —— developing coun-
tries where treatment is very difficult to
come by.” ’

“I think every school and child and
every adult, certainly, knows the words
AIDS and HIV now. It’s part of our lexicon,
so I think the word is out there,” he added,
saying that the people most at risk in the
younger generation don’t seem to be aware
of the dangers of “high-risk activities.”

He also said that minority populations
are more at risk, according to statistics. For
this reason, he said, the Men’s Study group
has accepted “hundreds of men in the com-
munity.” »

“The new medicine has changed the
whole face of AIDS. We’re tracking those
very closely, not only the positive elfects
[and] how t.hey’re preventing disease, but
also the side elfects — they’re very toxic
side—eﬂ’ects,” Rinaldo explained.

Rinaldo said that the stigma of being
tested for AIDS prevents many people from
seeking the test. While testing for
HIV/ADDS might be done privately at home,
he said the individuals should have ﬁiends
and family if the results come out positive
for I-IIV/AIDS.

“Ihose individuals who do it need sup-
port, though, because if they turn out posi-
tive, they need psycho and social support
[Testing themselves] at home, they have to
be very careful about that, because of the
obvious potential that, if they are infected, it
could be potentially traumatic.”

“We’re in it for the long haul,” said
Rinaldo. He says “University people” will
work with countries in Africa to battle
Malaria and HIV, which are major health
concerns around the globe.

Other events will follow AIDS day this
week in Oakland, including a speech at the
Graduate School of Public Health building
Wednesday addressing “HIV in the African
American Community,” a Wednesday night
speech addressing the medical aspects of
HIV/AIDS, a women—only discussion on
HIV/AIDS Thursday night and a movie
Friday night.

ity, causing Franklin to always strive for the
“appearance of humility” to those around
himandtohisreaders,Isaacsonadded

When it came to politics, Isaacson

noted, Franklin relied on this appearance of
humility to help him take bold actions.
During his time in Europe, Franklin took to
wearing a coonskin hat and philosophizing
with French high society and government
officials. According to Isaacson, this
Franklin-created character of the “simple,
backwoods philosopher” helped sway the
French into action by appealing to basic
moral values like opposing tyranny.

As a delegate at the Constitutional

Convention in 1787, Franklin was 40 years
older than the average age of the other
attending delegates. According to Isaacson,
though, Franklin’s personality was needed to
bring a compromise between the competing
interests drawing up the Constitution.

“You need the revered pedestal of a

George Washington. You need the young
thinkers like a Thomas Jeﬁerson. You need
the unbending and uncompromising charac-
ter of a John Adams,” Isaacson said “But
you also need the practical and pragmatic
common ground of a Ben Franklin to estab-
lish the basic values that I think we’ve lost in
politics today,” Isaacson said

The unanswered question of slavery

.created one of the great discrepancies in the
creation of the U.S. Constitutionlsaacson

Slavery “major blot” for abolitionist Franklin

said Franklin owned two slaves in his early
life and allowed for the advertisement of
slave auctions in his Pennsylvania Gazette.

Over the course of his long life, Franklin
kept a “moral ledger,” where he balanced
out his mistakes with his good acts, Isaacson
said Seeing his support of‘ slavery as a
“major blot” on his moral record, Franklin
freed his slaves and later became head of the
Society for the Abolition of Slavery.

On his deathbed, Franklin wrote a criti-
cal satire of slavery from the point of view of
anAlge1ian pirate engaged in the white slave
trade. He defended the practice on all the
same basic moral and economic grounds
that the supporters of the black slave trade
used inAmerica. ' I

American abolitionists later used the
"work as a major written argument against the
practice, Isaacson said.

When one person asked what.Franklin
would have thought of the USA PATRIOT

‘ Act, which ‘ gives the American government

increased domestic inforrnation-gathering
and surveillancepowers, Isaacson answered
by giving a quote from one of Franklin’s
Revolutionary-era writings. ‘

"Ihose who would ' give up essential
liberties for temporary safety deserve neither
liberty nor safety,” Isaacson said

When asked what he thought Franklin’s

— most important invention was, Isaacson —

answered that it was the creation of the

“middle-class American persona” of

Franklinhirnself. ,

Bush silent on steel tariff in Steel City’

President George W. Bush spoke
in Pittsburgh yesterday and said noth-
mg.
Actually, he said quite a lot --
five pages worth of speech ‘at a fund-
raising luncheon, with lip service
paid to everyone from House Speaker
Dennis Hastert — whom he called
“Denny” — to his mom. He also
addressed issues ranging from the
ongoing occupation in Iraq to third
quarter annualized growth numbers
to why most Americans could use a
J08-

But Bush said nothing about the

World Trade Organization’s recent‘

ruling that the United States’ steel
tariffs were illegal, as he was expect-
ed to do — an expectation that gar-
nered about 180 articles listed on
Google News previewing the speech,
as well as protesters from the steel
industry rallying‘ outside the Westin
Hotel and Convention Center, where
Bush spoke.

For all the media’s bated breath,
nothing was said, a political miscal-
culation that could cost Bush much of
his support from Western
Pennsylvania businesses.

Pittsburgh doesn’t mill the steel it
once did, but it’s still a town with a
long memory, and one in which the
mill days have become part of the
local personality. Ignoring the steel
issue — which opens the U.S._steel
industry to foreign competition — in

Pittsburgh is a downright foolish
thing to do.

And it’s especially foolish when
one of the luncheon’s co-chairs was
U.S. Steel’s Chairman and CEO
Thomas Usher, who, in the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, said he was “quite anx-
ious to see‘ the president”, about this
issue.

The speech Bush did make was
pure ﬂuff — it was to a friendly aud-i-
ence, with the media relegated -to a
guarded box and not allowed to ask
questions. In a speech to his support-
ers, Bush could have directly
addressed this hot-button issue and,

" even if he did not take a strong

stance,given it the attention it
deserved. Instead he talked about
everything but, ﬂoundering under the
spotlight. His was a weak reaction
from a president whose approval rat-
ings are getting weaker. 
Perhaps he was afraid that taking a
stance would alienate his business
supporters, who paid $2,000.a plate
for the privilege of seeing him.
Pittsburgh is a pretty Democratic
town, and, if he wants to win
Pennsylvania in 2004, he’ll need
whatever votes he can scrounge.
With his popular support declin-
ing, perhaps he chose silence over
committing to an unpopular policy, a
silence that speaks more to his inabil-
ity to answer concretely than his
words would have. A

A “Brentin Mockery” of black issues

We need more black students writing for
The Pitt News. We need more black editors.
We need more black photographers. We
need black students actively engaging them-

selves in the determination to change the.

process with which they routinely ﬁnd fault.
These words, written by now—grad -

ed, now-professional journalist, fonner Pitt‘

News columnist Brentin Mock, have sat qui-
etlyin our oﬂice archives for the »
past two years. Did his dream of
a more diverse college newspa-
per come true? Hardly. /
At present, we’ve got a
strong set of columnists. We’ve
deﬁnitively handled a bevy of
topics ranging from serious to
satirical, political to academic.
Yet I say we could be doing .
more from a university-wide
social perspective. The sad fact
is that The Pitt News hasn’t had
a black issues columnist in three

, semesters’———afullyearandahalf-—'and so

we don’t properly represent this campus.‘
Within this section, I think we should be
addressing all of our universitycommunity.

As descendents of those who suﬁ_”ered
U.S. government-sanctioned slavery, legal
lynching, Jim Crow and were barred college
entrance due to skin -color — afnong many
more injustices —— we are entitled to certain
provisions, laws, amendments, policies and
rules that correct what was unjustly done in
the past. . . I

I began to understand a black person’s ‘

plight through Mock’s.colurrms. I leamed to

understand why black pride is still so des-V -

perately important today. I learned to under-
stand someone who ‘isn’t just like me. Just
because black issues of campus, segregation,
black retention and graduation, racial proﬁl-

ing and minority visibility aren’t being dealt ‘

with as openly today as in Mock’s columns,
it doesn’t mean that these issues simply

, solved themselves. We need a voice in the

newspaper to represent the frequently under-

  

Ben Rubin

. Columnist

represented, commonly unappreciated, his-
torically subjugated minority so in danger,
because of the low retention rate at this
school, and make that voice a regular part of
our public campus forum. Doing this would-
n’t only aid a speciﬁc group, but would bring
more dimension and range to our paper. We
would open our community. Additionally,
ﬂiere are just some issues that a black colum-
nist would have more insight
' into —— even this column.
White students hold the
Homecoming coronation as
pure folly because for hun-
dreds of years they’ve_ grown
accustomed to seeing people
that look like them win it. We
of the minority races and ‘cul-
tures have only just begun to

 

see someone like us win it. So
yeah, its a big deal. -

Two years ago, Pitt was
rated “the llth worst university for racial

and  interaction” out of 9331 U.s.i"co1i— I

leges by the Princeton Review. Since my
ﬁrst year here, I’ve very happily Watched
this campus socially desegregate substantial-
ly"—— that rating is no longer true — and I
think this had something to do with people
like Brentin Mock, who openly addressed
important racial issues, who increased the
black voice on campus, who saw the lack of

minority visibility as a problem and did . A

something about it. The Opinions section
doesn’t have a sign on it saying “No
Blac ,” visible or invisible. Let’s not let the
voice of the black columnist fall silent.

You know what? I graduate at the end of
the semester. So please, apply and try to take
my position. I won’t be needing it when I’m
back at myparents’ house. Brentin Mock’s
dreamcould some day comettue——andﬂ1at
day-could be as early as this January. A

Showering could be hazardous to your health

Violent murder in “Psycho.”
Spider attack in “Arachnophobia.”
Masturbation in “American Beauty.”
Finding unnerving shower scenes in
Hollywood isn’t too difficult.
Obviously, the movie industry is
sending a powerful message: showers
should be avoided. Americans may be
fat and superficial, but, gosh-darn—it,
we’re clean.

The average American showers
once a day. Yet daily showers are not
only a waste of time and money, but
also a health hazard. I’m not suggest-
ing you should never shower, just less
often —— say, every other day. If you
already practice this, then good for
you. You may stop reading this and
continue on to the crossword puzzle.

With finals approaching, students
willingly give up their first born to
gain extra minutes for cramming and
buying papers off the Internet.

Stopping excessive showering is
a quick way to add length to your
day. Including pre-and post-shower
activities, the average time needed
for bathing is 20 minutes. Triple that
if you’re a female age 12 or above.
By ‘my calculation, over the course of
a lifetime, people spend an average of
511,000 hours in the shower.

That’s an extra year you could
spend making out, watching “The
Young and the Restless” oreating ice

cream. Speaking in instant gratifica-
tion terms, that’s 20 more minutes
you can dream about Justin
Timberlake or Britney Spears dating
you to make the other jealous.

Plus, bathing daily isn’t getting

you as clean as you think. Due to,»
many soaps’ chemical content, after a’

shower, the skin’s pH _
rises, making it more alka-
line, which allows an
increase in bacterial
growth. Furthermore, a
study conducted in the late
1990s by the
Environmental Working
Group discovered 10 mil-
lion people in 374 com-
munities across l2 states
were exposed to at least
one weed killer in their
water. Urn, gross.

If there’s one thing college stu-
dents need more than time, it’s
money. Showering daily is hardly a
practical investment. Shampoos, con-
ditioners, body washes, body scrubs,
soaps, loofahs, . washcloths, towels,
hairdryers, defrizzers, curl enhancers,
shower radios, shower mats, cleaning
supplies -—— these seemingly innocent
products add up in cost. The less you
use them, the less you buy them. It’s
so simple, yet so genius.

Water is another bathing necessi-

ty. In fact, a quick five—minute showr-
er uses 50 gallons of water. I don’t
want to believe it, either, but my par-
ents insist that water isn’t free. And
hot water needs energy to be heated,
which also happens to be costly.
Clearly, showering is money down
the drain. Pun absolutely intended.
As if showers didn’t
violate us enough by
snatching away our pre-
cious time and money,
they threaten our lives.
Nobody wants to die in a
shower accident. It’s a
lackluster way to go, and
you’re ‘naked, which is
awkward for everybody.
The bathroom, with all its
hard, pointy surfaces and
slippery ﬂoors, is easily
the most dangerous room
in the house. My grandmother didn’t
die directly in the shower, but she
slipped, then grabbed the towel rack,
which fell, causing her to fall and her
leg to break. She died four years
later. For all we know, the shower
incident could have resulted in her
death. '
-According to the Allergy and
Asthma Network Web site, molds
commonly found in shower stalls can
causenasal and sinus congestion,
burning eyes, cough and irritation of

the nose, throat and skin. Some molds
have even been linked to depression
and cancer. And plenty of students
are currently experiencing the won-
derful world of communal showers, a
breeding ground for athlete’s foot.
The less often you step into the show-
er aka death trap — the safer
you’ll be. .

” It’s tough to get used-to the idea
of taking fewer showers. But
Europeans have done it forever. If
you think showering less will make
you less appealing, youirgemistaken.
Any fashion magazine will tell you
that hair looks better the day after a
washing than it does the day of. It

needs to be approached carefully. If

State wrong to revoke theology student’s scholarship

Prior to his 2003 graduation, Joshua Davey could be
considered a typical college student, with two notable
exceptions — he’s smarter than most of us, and more
determined. Plus, he is the momentum behind a lawsuit
that appeared before the Supreme Court this week and
added another dimension to the nation’s multi-
faceted discussion of church and state.

Davey’s case — arguing that government
scholarship money cannot be denied simply
because an applicant pursues a religious degree ——
is speciﬁc enough to duck headlines but signiﬁcant
enough to raise eyebrows. It’s inspiring, not only
because of its value as a legal precedent, but also
because it’s the story of a college student challeng-
ing a government that has overstepped its bounds.

After graduating high school with impressive
numbers in 1999, Davey was awarded a Promise
Scholarship, part of Washington State’s ﬁnancial
aid program. Everything seemed ﬁne, even when
he decided to use the funding to attend Northwest
College, a Christian school on Seattle’s east side.

But when Davey declared his major in Theology,
the state respondedby stripping him of his scholarship,
citing a Washington statute that prohibits state money
from funding religious degrees. '

Davey ﬁled suit to have the law changed, and the
Ninth United States Circuit Court of Appeals — the
same court that declared the Pledge of Allegiance
unconstitutional because of its reference to God —— ruled

in his favor. Governor Gary Locke and the Washington

I,

 

State Attorney General’s Ofﬁce then petitioned the

Supreme Court, which agreed to hear arguments and
scheduled the proceedings, which occurred Dec. 2.

It confuses me that Governor Locke has pushed this
case all the way to the nation’s highest court. Why fight
_ so vigorously to keep an $1,100 aid

package from falling into the-hands
of an exceptional student simply
because he’s an active Christian who
wants to study the faith in college?
Of course, the answer is “sep—

is just another ‘instance of the
catchall motto becoming a little too
stretched. A

Keeping church and govern-
ment separate is necessary because
the church needs to be protected
from the inﬂuence of the state as
much as the state from the church.
But while the separation is noble on the grand scale, it
also allows for a lot of legal nitpicking.

Again and again, this issue ﬁlls courtrooms with
arguments about statues and nativity scenes and holiday
political correctness — issues that could easily be
resolved with a little levelheaded thinking and a town
meeting or two. If Washington state decides to give
Joshua Davey a scholarship, how he uses it is his busi-
ness.

The idea that awarding state funding to a theology

aration of church and state,” but this .

‘student is somehow a government endorsement of reli-
gion is ﬂirnsy at best. In addition to providing people
with guidance, counseling, charity and fellowship on a
personal level, ministers and religious scholars also hold
incredible cultural significance.

Would Washington be ashamed if it helped Davey
become the next Billy "Graham, D.L. Moody, \V1lliam
Wﬂberforce or William Booth? If not, would it be

‘ashamed to help an intelligent student with a ﬁxed

income study a subject that interests him? Apparently
so.

The relatively small allowance that the Promise
Scholarship would have given Davey has never been
central to the suit, and it is especially irrelevant now that
he has graduated with high honors from Northwest
College and is in his first year at Harvard Law School.
The money would have been nice to have, much like the
support of his home state. , I ‘

But now that Joshua Davey has proven his intelli-
gence at the collegiate level and continues to do so in
grad school, Governor Locke’s case will be discredited,
win or lose. Locke had a chance to support a brilliant

‘young man. Instead, he will be remembered for his

efforts to hold a brilliant young man back.

Dr. Don Argue, president of Northwest College, put
it best: “I guess this proves that Governor Locke was
right all along. Joshua is a student with a great deal of
promise.”

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

The heard is majestic, theovie is not

The Last Samurai
Starring Tom Cruise, 'Fmothy
Spall, Billy Connolly

Directed by Edward Zwick
</2:1/2

Tom Cruise’s scruffy beard in “The
Last Samurai” is magniﬁcent. It is a mar-
vel of modern facial hair, engineered with
painstaking precision to look ﬁt for a ruler
of nations or a king of beasts, an action
hero or a movie mogul. It is reborn with
every new facial expression; it takes on
new signiﬁcance ﬁom every new angle, in
every new light. I give it four stars.

However, next to the actor’s majestic
beard, the ﬁlm is but a nasty blond ‘stache.

Not even director Edward Zwick, who
is ‘no stranger to period war ﬁlms
(“Glory”), can lend it the kind of irnpor—
tance it desperately wants.

The ﬁlm is a romanticized depiction of
the last stand of the samurai — so lovable
with their ever-willingness to jam daggers
in their own guts at the suggestion that
they’ve misplaced their honor —— against
the forces of Westem-turning 1870s Japan.

Cruise is Nathan Algren, American

bat so they can obliterate the last of I the
sword—faithful— samurai.

During the troops’ first attempt,
Algren is taken prisoner by the samurai
and forced to —— gasp — hang out with
them for several months.

Over the course of -the ﬁlm’s punish-
ing two—and-a-half-plus hour running time,
Algren learns several lessons: spirituality
exists; samurai are cooler than regular
Japanese people, who are apparently evil;
you shouldn’t kill people just because
you’re paid to; and honor is not dead — at_
least not yet.

In addition to its gag-inducing_ themes,
the ﬁlm continually+—j and urmervingly_—

threatens a romance between -Algren and '
Taka, the wife of a samurai who -Algren‘

killed. I

Timothy Spall and Billy Connolly,
ﬁne actors reduced to mechanisms, pro-
vide the supporting facial hair; Spall has
bushy sideburns, and Connolly a tidy
Vandyke.

The battle sequences bring the ﬁlm’s
only endurable moments. They are less
graceful—this is agoodthing—than
those of most Hollywood fare. Ask some-

war hero and alcoholic, a man who can’t one to wake you up during them.

Otherwise, the ﬁlm is an unexciting
battles than he should have. He is recruited and urmecessary retread of “Dances with

Yet another loss tothe world of MP3 downloading

I’m not going to lie to you. I
download so much music that
it would make your head
spin. In fact, I have so much
music that I could honestly
queue it all up, throw it on
shufﬂe, and never hit a repeat
song for ﬁve straight months
of jamming. I’m no thief; I go
out and buy between two and

our CDs at month to support
my artists. But there was a lit-
tle Web site that got me start-
ed on ﬁnding new music, and
now it’s going to disappear.

All good things must come to an end at some
point. CNet Networks, Inc., the brains behind sites
such as download.com has bought out MP3.com. As
of 3 p.m. yesterday, all artists on MP3.com were
deleted. CNet plans to start charging artists to host
their music on a site that once hosted it for free, and
this is atrocious. As an. artist myself, I used MP3.com
to store my band’s music for free, and raked in about

1,500 downloads in a short period of time. Now, to
do this, I’m going to have to pay. That’s damn ludi-

 

Adam Rauf

   

crous if you ask me. But why was MP3.com so
important to us, as college students?
Back in 1997, when I found out about a little file

format called MP3, I was astounded that my favorite ‘

songs could be compressed into a ﬁle that I could
pass freely over instant messages, and a little pro-
gram called Napster written by a college boy named
Sean Fanning came out in 1999. Back then, it was
easy to get music I wanted. Previously, I was scour-

_ ing the Web with search engines to look for songs

when I stumbled across a Web site called MP3.com.
What luck! I thought that there was plenty of good
music lying around there for grabs, and I was right.
Most of the music at the «time was by independent
artists, and I eventually found lots of hardcore, metal
and other great things that I would not have discov-
ered without this site.

After all the Metallica-hating going on with
Napster, MP3.com still stayed strong by providing
the masses with a great way to hear music constant-
ly. They eventually even included radio stations that
could be run by users and allowed artists to submit
their music to the Web site and be heard. Even the
artists’ stats were tracked. What a freaking Web site!
Slowly but surely, mainstream artists found this site

I ..r,__..

to be a new way‘ to exploit the masses and get people
to hear their new cuts, special songs and live editions

—- and it worked. Artists like the Beastie Boys, I

Eminem, Madonna, Blink 182 and more had a new
conduit for reaching their fans. MP3.com was truly a
haven ‘for music, both mainstream and independent.

, As the final days were approachingfthe Web site was

slowly going‘ downhill. Member e-mails came out
with advertisements and mostly mainstream artists,

and pop—up ads greeted you as you reached the site.

Previously, the site was ad-free and promoted most-

ly independent artists. Yet after all of that, MP3.com _

was still allowing artists to sign up and get free host-
ing. They also had a paid artist signup that would pay
you based on how_many downloads you had — they
are planning to pay all artists that had this as of shut-
down. -

Why should you be thankful for MP3.com? I

Because without it, your friends’ band, or perhaps
one of your current favorite bands, would not have
had a launch point for breaking out into the open.
Goodbye, MP3.com; a good chunk of us will miss
you, but the rest of us will remain in your debt for-
ever, whether or not we were utilizing you in your
glory days. ‘

Amour Amer

Electric Monkey Records
$371./2

There’s a certain type of music you

need to get you in the mood — you know, .

the mood; Youfre just sitting there, all alone
with your_ female (or male) companion, and

'  things are getting hot and heavy. Instead of

reaching for your Portishead or Massive
Attack“‘albi'1jm's, you reach for Amour Amer
by Joel. What‘you’re in for is not an all-

, night ‘passionate sex romp; you’re looking at

a lukewarm experience that didn’t try hard

enough. Z 

' This poor man cannot decide whether
he likes Latin or French backing styles
more, andplikes to crisscross them. It’s a
valiant effort, but fails to really back his
voice. Joel?s voice is deﬁnitely his strong

point, with soft and gentle whispers that still i

seem to be wonderfully on—key. The minute
you start up the record, it begins with chants
that may have you believing that he’s reach-
ing deep to his black roots, but then falls into

a lazy number that could have been volumes

better. - - .- _

This 60-minute CD would be a decent
pop—soul record, but instead touts itself as
“wildly romantic,” and “incredibly»sexy.”

Low sexy expectations

ly. Under the correct production, this record
could have done substantially well, but
unfortunately, the backing music destroys
any real sexy feel that Joel could have con-
veyed. Every song has a falling bass riff that
sounds like it was ripped off of James Bond
movie soundtracks. At times, his songs are
strong enough to light a few candles and

, pour some Chardonnay, but at the next tum,
1 you dump it out, blow out the candles and sit

in front of the television for better entertain-
ment.

“Carnal Mariners’? deﬁnitely ruins any
mood that Amour Amer had going for it so
far, and is onlyrthe third song deep into the
l4—,,song endeavor.,,Als‘o, a note of advice to
Joel: singing in ‘French at random times will
not increase your sex appeal. Also, he
should have reﬁained from covering a song
that feels nothing. like the original —
“Femme Fatale,”_ which sounds more like a
half-assed and drawn-out version of the
original than like the delightfully beautiful

‘ rocker by the Velvet Underground. Besides,

does this song really have any good reason
to be on a “sexy” album? ‘

All in all, if you’re expecting a pop
album in the style of say, Macy Gray, you
might be in for a real treat. The vocals are
good, and his lyrics are halfway decent-
except when he attempts to throw in forced
French phrases. in order to increase

appeal— andiit’s even an hour in length. '

THE PITT NEWS

A little motivation to get in the kitchen and cook
up some creative meals: do it with Straub beer
THE

The Straub BeerCookbook
John E. Schlim ll

JES ll Starstruck

2003 '

ihﬁr 1/2

There is a little drinking cliche that avid
partygoers state with enthusiasm: “Beer can
be food, but food can never be beer.” Who

knew that there was indeed a good bit of_

truth behind this quirky saying? In each

recipe in “The Straub Beer Cookboo ” —'

which has a 1942 excerpt from The Carbon
Copy stating, “Beer, to begin with, is a food”
— beer is an ingredient. In some recipes, it
seems to be a vital ingredient, while in oth-
ers, it seems that the author, John E.
Schlimm II, struggled to ﬁll the pages and
chose recipes where a mere tablespoon of
beer could be added.

Recipes that use a signiﬁcant amount of
brew include Straub Beer Fondue, Straub
Light Beer Cheese Bread, Straub Beer
Sauerkraut and Straub Beer Steak Fajitas -
that’s right, the proper name for each dish
begins with “Straub Beer” or Straub Light
Beer.” If you are running low on beer and
need to conserve it, but still want to cook
with it, there are a good deal of recipes that
use it sparingly: Straub Beer Fried Potatoes,
Straub Beer Blazing Hot Wing Sauce,

(- ///’’(///A 1-“ /)r’r’/" - ///’/U/')

 

Ingredients
2 cups flour

Straub Beer Deviled Eggs and the Straub
Beer Hummus Wrap.

And what would a beer cookbook be
with out a recipe for beer—battered shrimp,

. beer bread or beer chili? Have no fear; the

masters at Straub have included them with
their own Straub twists. The old food cliche
of beer and pizza going hand in hand even
gets noted in this book —— but here, the beer
is in the pizza sauce.

In addition to quick and fun dishes that
seem fairly easy for even the novice cook to
whip up, at the end of each chapter is a fea-

ture called ‘Tradition on Tap,” which takes «

you through the history of the Straub brew-
ing legacy from the brewery’s founder, Peter
Straub, through prohibition, to the what
modem enquiring minds want to know —
the number of calories‘ and carbohydrates in
a l2—ounce serving of Straub or Straub Light
beer. 1
Each recipe depends on beer, but
whether or not it depends on Straub beer
remains unseen. Breweries vary the amount
of hops, wheat, barley and sugars that they
put in their beers, and this, of course, varies
the taste. You can stick with the book’s trade?
mark Straub brand, but there is no reason to
ignore your culinary urges simply because
there is Budweiser in your refrigerator
instead of Straub.

Psychologists not needed to help exlain the meain of In

In the Zone
Britney Spears
Jive Records
‘£r71‘r1/2 I

The day has arrived. You can ﬁnally
sleep well again, now that your nerves
have calmed and the restless nights
ﬁlled with anticipation are over. Ladies,
your boyfriends no longer have to put up
with you biting your nails because
you’re worried about when'you’re going
to have timetoigetvtolthe‘ store. ,,

What else couldl possibly be talk:
ing about but thelatest Britney Spears.
CD to hit stores? We’ve seen every
magazine cover and read every article
confirming the date of her newest musi-
cal venture. In the Zone is ﬁnally here;
I’m sure your boyfriends are ecstatic.

Critics warned about the new sound
Spears was experimenting with; and«
though In the Zone is undoubtedly
Spearssish, her songs’ cover more con—_
troversial topics than that of “E-M_ail
My Heart,” from Spears’ debut album,
...Baby _One More Time.

The latest songs are reminiscent of
earlier Spears" CDs, but with a more
c_lub—like approach. For instance, the

, first song off her newest album — the

song that’s been on TRL so ‘many times
that even your grandma has the lyrics to
“Me Against the Music” down pat -—~

has the DJ s at fraternity parties spinning
it on repeat for all those scantily clad
girls. And if this is the case, we know
she’s back and triumphing. .

And she’s -going about it the right

way. How better to return to the world of I

fake hair — and hope to make her ex
jealous — than by doing so with her
make—out buddy, Madonna? Even if she
is a former little’ Mouseketeer, Spears

‘still has no prayer against that woman.
. But it can only help Spears’ album’s

success. . - . .
Though I have already been caught

3 several times by my roommates dancing

to “Toxic” and “The Hook Up,” I would
never use her lyrics on my AOL Instant
Messenger profile. _After all, her song
messages aren’t taxing on the brain.
However, I’m glad Spears elaborated on
the message behind “Me Against the
Music,” on a recent episode of MTV’s

“Making the_Video,” because thesong is . I
_ just that deep. Please. I love the girl, but

to explore its meaning. P’  
Unless, of course, you listen to the
track titled, “Touch of My Hand,” a
song about self—pleasure at its ﬁnest. I
guess that is a great introduction to the
following track, “The Hook Up.” While
I may sound like I’m‘ kidding‘ — until

none» of. her songs needs a psychologist

‘ my roommate told me, I did think»

“Touch of My Hand” was about a hand-
shake  what else do you expect from

Miami defensive end Baraka Atkins closes in -on Pitt quarterback Rod Rutherford during Miami’s 28-14 winat Heinz
Field on -Saturday. The Panthers will face Virginia in the Continental Tire Bowl on Dec. 27.

Pitt falls to Hurricanes, 28-14

JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

Heading into Saturday’s game
against Miami, Pitt had the opportunity
to clinch a share of its first Big East
title and a berth in the Bowl
Championship Series. 1

Instead, the Hurricanes (10-2 over-
all, 6-1 Big East) stormed through
Heinz Field and defeated the Panthers,
28-14, sending Pitt (8-4, 5-2) to the
Continental Tire Bowl. ‘

 However, Pitt was able to keep one
streak alive. ‘

With just under three minutes
remaining, quarterback Rod
Rutherford hit receiver Larry
Fitzgerald in the middle of the end
zone for a touchdown to make the score
look better than it was.

.The score marked the 18th consec-
utive game in which Fitzgerald has
caught a touchdown as well as his 12th
consecutive game this season with a
TD catch, tying a record set by
Marshall’s Randy Moss in 1997.

Unfortunately for Pitt, that was.

about the only thing that went right on

\ .

this cold night; they were soundly beat-
en by a Miami team that is no stranger
to games with championship implica-
tions.

“The best way for me to describe.
Miami is —-— I remember a couple of
years ago we had a receiver by the
name of Antonio Bryant,” Pitt coach
Walt Harris said after the game. “He
wasn’t even on [Miami’s] radar screen.
He came here, responded here, became
a tremendous football player here, and

‘won the Biletnikoff. [Miami] didn’t

even try to recruit him.”

Miami may have missed out on
Bryant, but there were quite a few'p1ay-
ers on the opposing sideline that Harris
likely would love to have, including
linebackers Jonathan Vilma and D.J.
Williams, who combined for 20 tackles
and three of the nine sacks of
Rutherford. 7

“I can’t ﬁnd the words to describe
how we feel as a team,” Rutherford
said.

“They wanted the game more than
we did, and the results were on the
scoreboard]? nose tackle Vince
Crochunis said.

Pitt came out of the gate looking
like a team that wanted the game. After
forcing Miami to go three—and-out on
its ﬁrst drive, the Panthers drove 64
yards on nine plays and‘ took a 7-0 lead
when Rutherford hit. tight end Kris
Wilson for a 2-yard touchdown pass.

Pitt came out in a jumbo set on 3rd
and goal. Fitzgerald was blocking on
the play, which probably came as a sur-
prise .to the Hurricanes, and when
Rutherford rolled to his left, Wilson
was uncovered in the back of the end
zone.

The Panthers had a chance to
stretch their early lead a few minutes
later, but were unable to capitalize on
safety Tyrone Gil1iard’s interception of
Miami quarterback Brock Berlin.

“It’s hard enough to play against a
great defensive team and take three
downs to make 10 yards, let alone take
three downs to make 15 yards,” Harris
said about how Pitt hurt its chances
with penalties. “We have no excuse for
that. We’re one of the least penalized
teams in our league, and we’re playing

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

With about two minutes left in
the second quarter, the scoreboards
at Heinz Field malfunctioned and
were turned off for the remainder of
the game.

As if it mattered. At that point,
the Hurricanes were already up 21-
7.and were dominating the Panthers

‘offensively. Miami had 263 yards

on offense, compared to Pitt’s 7
yards. ‘

Never mind the score and yards
gained. This game was all about
missed opportunities, and Pitt had
more thanits fair share.

Pitt scored on its first posses-
sion to go up 7-0 and intercepted a
pass from Miami quarterback
Brock Berlin on the very next
drive.

“It was a great first drive —
things were going good, and then
you saw what I saw,” head coach
Walt Harris said.

What fans saw was a chance to
go up on Miami by more than one
score, but the Panthers were called
for a false start, making it first-and-
15.

Then the first of‘nine sacks of
quarterback Rod Rutherford made
it second-and-21, and Harris called
two run plays on second and third
downs, which went for a total of
zero yards. Pitt then punted to
Miami, who drove down the field to
tie the game at seven.

Terrell Allen returned the ensu-
ing kickoff 63 yards, and Pitt was
28 yards from taking the lead.

But Rutherford was sacked for
an 8-yard loss on first down, and on
second, he threw a 3-yard pass to
running back Brandon Miree. On
third down, Rutherford completed a
pass to wide receiver Princell
Brockenbrough for a 14-yard gain
—— one yard shy of the first down.

With the first quarter clock
winding down and fourth-and-one
upcoming, Rutherford called a
timeout.

Pitt picks up two wins

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Pitt won two games Over
Thanksgiving break to keep its all-W
time record at the Petersen Event
Center perfect at 19-0. Guard ‘Carl
Krauser scored a combined 43 points
in the two games, leading the Panthers
(4-0) to wins Over Robert Morris and
Albany.

Pitt‘75, Robert Morris 61

Robert Morris traveled to Pitt On
Wednesday toavenge a 36-point loss it
suffered at the Pete last season, but
came up short. The Colonials kept the
game close for the first 13' minutes of
the first half and held a 21-20 lead
with 9:47 left in the half.

The Panthers then went On a 13-2
run, which put them up 36-23. Guard
Jaron Brown started the run when he
took a pass from guard Yuri Demetris
and pulled up for a 3-pointer with a
Colonial defender in his face.’

Forward Chris Taft scored the next
two buckets for the Panthers, both
coming on layups. Brown would score
two more buckets himself to continue
the run that put the Panthers ahead for
good. ,

The Colonials spent much of the
rest of the game down by at least 10

points.
With 12:18 left in the game, the

Colonials did cut the Panther lead tO_

five points, but Pitt quickly rebounded
with two three—point plays.

The first play came from forward
Chevon Troutman, who was fouled
while making a layup. He added the
free throw, then Krauser made a three-
pointer to extend the Panther lead to 11
points. _

Krauser finished the game with 21
points, two assists and four steals. He
also had seven turnovers in the game.

“I know I’m a better player than
that,” Krauser said. “I was just making
a couple of careless mistakes that I
shouldn’t have made. I’ve just got to
come back next game and play better.”

Pitt finished the game with three
other Panthers scoring in double digits
— guard Julius Page, Troutman and

-Brown. Brown scored 19 points and

recorded 3 assists.

Pitt 83, Albany 54

Krauser scored a career—high 22
points in a victory against Albany on
Friday. Taft also had a career game,
recording his first double-double —— 10
points and 10 rebounds.

Berenato gets first win as Pitt head coach during break

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
SENIOR STAFF WRITER

It was a tale of two teams in the
Pitt women’s basketball squad’s
first week of regular-season action.

On Tuesday," the Panthers dis-
played the inexperience of a team
dressing ‘five sophomores and three
freshmen, turning the ball over 18
times en route to a 75-61 loss to
Coppin State. But the Panthers
bounced back on Friday afternoon,
playing aggressively on both sides
of the ball and grabbing 11 steals to

‘help seal a 75-59 victory over

Central Connecticut State.

Coppin State 75,‘ Pitt 61

The 2003‘ season opener was a
sloppy affair for the.Panthers, with
Pitt shooting only 32.8 percent from
the ﬂoor and committed 16 person-
al fouls in the loss to the Lady
Eagles. .

The Panthers got off to a good

start, taking a 9-4 lead with 16 min-'

utes left in the first half. But the

Lady Eagles exploded on a ‘14-7 run

over the next seven minutes and
repelled a small run by the Panthers

to hang on to a 39-37 halftime lead.

The second half was all Coppin.

State, as the Lady Eagles jumped
out to a 17-4 run at the outset. The
Panthers could not close the deficit
to less than nine from that point,
and a strong finish by Coppin State
(1-1) clinched the 75-61 victory.

Leading the way for the
Panthers (0-1) was senior forward
Latoya Kincaid, who dropped a
double-double on the Lady Eagles
with 14 points and 11 rebounds.
Forward Sheilaistufﬂet -added 10
points and 8 rebounds for the
Panthers, and guard Jessica Allen
scored 11 points on two-for-six
shooting from three-point land.

Junior point guard Amy
-Kunich’s six assists matched her six
turnovers, and center‘ Bridget
Larkin contributed 13 points and
five boards off of the bench for the
Panthers.

Coppin State center Leisel
Harry dominated the low post for
the Lady Eagles, scoring 23 points
on 10-of-17 shooting to lead the
game.

Pitt’s motion offense and full-
court pressure defense caused seri-
ous problems for the Blue Devils,
causing Central Connecticut State
to cough the ball up 28 times and
ensuring new head coach Agnus
first victory ~ as a
Panther. _

Pitt hit its first three three-point
attempts to jump out to a 15-2 lead
in the game’s first five minutes. But
guard Kerrin Fesik sparked a come-
back for the Blue Devils, yelling at
her teammates and hitting three
quick three-pointers of her own to
cut the Pitt lead to seven points at
halftime. '

Pitt started off the second half
with another big run, this time scor-
_ing 12 of the half ’s first 15 points to
grab a 16-point lead with just under
16 minutes to play. But a combina-
tion of several -consecutive defen-
sive stops and several free-throw
attempts over the next 10 minutes
enabled Central Connecticut State
to cut the Panther lead to five with
seven minutes left to go. But the

Pitt head coach Walt Harris watches during the ﬁnal minutes of the Panthers’

28-14 loss to Miami on Saturday. ,

in a championship game.  can’t under-

stand why we jumped offside.”

Running back Brandon Miree was '

never able to get on track, and as Pitt

fell behind, he was used less. He ﬁn-.
ished with 27 yards on 10 carries after '

rushing for a career—high 188 yards the
week before. 1

“[We’ve had] consistent trouble
stopping the run and consistent trouble
running the ball [all ‘season],” Harris
said. a . .

A Miami had two running backs rush
for over 100 yards, including Tyrone
Moss, who ran the ball four consecu-
tive times to ﬁnish off the Hurricanes’
ﬁrst touchdown drive. The capper was
a 30-yard scamper in which Moss ran
untouched right up the middle _of the
defense for the touchdown.

, Moss ﬁnished with 115 yards on
the ground, while teammate Jarrett
Payton had 131 yards.

Pitt started its next drive on
Miami’s 28-yard line after Terrell
A11en’s kick return but had to settle for
a 37-yard field goal attempt by David
Abdul, an attempt that Abdul missed
wide left.

.-/..

to win first Big East title

The Hurricanes took control of the
game from that point on, scoring twice
more before the end of the half on runs
by Moss- and Payton. V

Miami put the game out of reach
with an interception by Sean Taylor on
Pitt’s first possession of the second
half. Miami drove 86 yards and scored
on a 45-yard touchdown pass from
Berlin to wide receiver Roscoe Parrish.
Berlin faked a handoff and lofted the
ball to Parrish, who had beaten Pitt cor-
nerback Tutu Ferguson down the left
sideline. ,

The , Hurricanes also kept
Fitzgerald in check all game, holding
him to just three catches for 26 yards.

“They played man [coverage] with

.a safety over top,” Rutherford said

regarding Miami’s strategy against
Fitzgerald. .“It wasn’t anything we
haven’t seen; they just did it better.”

The Heisman Trophy candidate
was disappointed after‘ the game, but
took solace in the fact that Pitt does
have one game remaining. .

“We wanted to go to the Orange
Bowl,” Fitzgeraldsaid. “Our goal from
the beginning of the year was to be Big
East champions. Unfortunately,- we

were unable to_ accomplish that goal.” . 9

‘,‘[There] was a lot of confu-
sion,” Rutherford said. “I didn’t
know what was going on.” '

Rather than go for it, Harris
opted to attempt a 37-yard field
goal into the open end of Heinz
Field, despite the fact that kicker
David Abdul has had trouble kick-
ing into the open -end his’ entire Pitt

- career. 7
And added to that were the 13- ’

miles-per-hour wind gusting around
the stadium. To no one’s surprise,
Abdul missed the field /goal, and
Pitt again missed a golden opportu-
nity. ’ «

- Miami then drove 80 yards on

.12 plays to ‘go up‘ 14-7.

On the next Panther drive, Pitt
would move the ball to the Miami

‘ 41-yard line, but a rush for no gain,
’ a false’ start penalty and a, sack of

Rutherford would lead to another

‘Andy Lee punt. \ .

“We shot ourselves in the foot,”
Harris said. ~ .
Pitt continued to do that, and

in just when it seemed there were no

more toes left, the Panthers man-
aged to fire off another round.

Down 21-7, Pitt got the ball
after halftime and drove to the
Miami 14-yard line.

To walk away with any points
would have been uplifting and pos-

itive for the Panthers, .but_,

Rutherford tried to squeeze a third-
down pass to Fitzgerald. .

Miami free safety Sean Taylor
intercepted it. . 

Pitt had its chances to win, but
missed tackles and questionable
play-calling came into play. 

After 11 games this season, the
defense still could not tackle. Two
Miami running backs shook off
would-be tacklers and ran; for over

- 100 yards each —~Jarre.tt Payton,

with 131, and Tyrone Moss, with
115. \

Questionable calls, such as run
plays and designed quarterback
draws, were"made even when Pitt
was down by 21 points.

‘ Pitt. had eight drives in the sec-
ond half andonly one went for a
touchdown. , A

.~ Three were stopped by intercep-
tions, andvfour ended in punts ——
including a drive where, with 9:05
left, down by5 21 and dealing with
fourth-and—seven, Harris opted to
punt. g '

Now, Pitt’s --regular season is
over; and -instead of getting a Bowl
Championship Series berth,*Pitt has
opted to punt and go to the

from there on. Albany spent the whole
game playing catch—up. The first half
ended with the score 32-27 and Great
Dane forward Levi Levine scored 12
of his 16 points in the first half.

Pitt came out after halftime and
turned on the offense. At one point, the
Panthers went on a 20-7 run and went
up on Albany by 32 points.

Freshman guard Antonio Graves
saw 14 minutes of play and wasione of
the four Panthers with double—digi_ts in
scoring. He had 11 points and two

‘ assists and also went three-for—five

from beyond the three—point line.

Head coach Jamie Dixon
explained how they made some adjust-
ments coming out of halftime in order
to get the team on track. The adjust-
ments led to a 51-point second half.

“We probably weren’t in the right
offense in the first half. We adjusted
that in the second, half,’’ Dixon said.
“On the defensive half, all it takes is
one guy to break down. We just looked
at the mistakes we made and how they
capitalized on them.”

Pitt’s next game is at Duquesne
