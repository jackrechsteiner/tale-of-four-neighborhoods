FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2001

They are often considered to be on opposite ends
of the political spectrum, so when Ralph Nader and Pat
Buchanan — both third-party candidates in the 2000
presidential election — met for their ﬁrst—ever debate,
some disagreement was to be expected.

,But the two forces in American politics squared off
on issues from national security to political oversight
last night, and agreed on a surprising number of posi-
tions. The debate, titled “What Kind of Political Party
Does America Need?” was held in David Lawrence
Hall. ’ A -

One of the issues of convergence was that of
Americanipolitics’ two—party system and its exclusion
of any challengers. Both spoke of the “media blackout”

- that they received during their 2000 campaigns, and the
need for immense amounts of money in any facet of
politics. ’ ~ m

I “If I had $3 billion,” Buchanan said in reference to
the fortune of former presidential candidate Ross Perot,
“I’ d spend 2.9 billion of it trying to get my message out
and if I lost, [my wife] Shelley and I would try to live
on the remaining 100 million-therest of our. lives.”

Nader agreed that campaign ﬁnance reform was
key to keeping politics in the hands of the citizens, and
also suggested other reforms, such as automatic runoffs
and a “none of the above” option on ballots that would
order new candidatesif it won a majority.

Ralph Nader, a 2000 presidential candidate, debated
with Pat Buchanan, also a contender for the presidency.

Ultimately, Nader said that no reforms would be
effective without participation from ordinary citizens.

we’re going to spend time on our civic responsibili-

Panel addresses unanswered Sept. 11 questions

JAMES DEWEESE
' A Senior Staff Writer

The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks sent
Americans “scurrying to their book-
shelves” in a misguided search for the
answer to the polemic question
“Why?” according to a professor from
Carnegie Mellon University.

, Leslie Eisenberg —— one of five
panelists assembled for Pitt Program
Council’s “Truth Behind the Terror”
lecture Wednesday night — said that
looking to the Koran, the holy book of
Islam, for an explanation does not
yield valid results.

Dr. Adel Fergany, president of the
Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, said
Islam embraces peace and submission.

According to Fergany, justice and
mercy —- for everyone, not just
Muslims — are a fundamental part of
that mission. .

Fergany also said a tremendous
amount of diversity exists within the

Muslim community, a diversity that he ~

said he believed the media has largely
overlooked. »

“[The media] -doesn_’t see a divi-
sion. Either you are black or you are
white,” Fergany said. '

Eisenberg agreed that that when
analyzing the role of Islam in the ter-
rorist attacks, distinctions must be

_ made with _respect to its many forms.

But she said, “Most'Muslims are -no
.more theologians or Koranic scholars
than Christians are.”

According to Eisenberg, the ques-
tion is not whether Islamic scripture
condones or expressly proscribes acts
of terrorism, but rather howiindividu—
als employ the diverse Islamic teach-
ings — what’s beingsaid inside the
Mosque and on the street, she said.

Eisenberg said that in some cases
Islam has become the sole vehicle for
political expression in the face, of
repressive authoritarian rule, -and this
creates a distinction between the
Islamic faith and Islamic fundamental-
ism.

nates religious ideology to a political
agenda, she said, and Islamic funda-
mentalists, not Muslims, "carried out
the attack on the World Trade Center

Islamic fundamentalism subordi-I

and the Pentagon. L

According to Eisenberg, these
Islamic fundamentalist groups general-
ly comprise a small core group of true
believers, ‘but they derive the majority

, of their support from the underserved

populations of many Middle Eastern
nations who have no other venue to
express their political dissatisfaction.

Eisenberg referredto this peripher-
al support as “soft support” because,
according to her, they turn to the fun-
damentalist ‘movements to express
their dissatisfaction. P

She added that in time, this soft
support might come to represent the
best hope for a stable future in the

Former Steeler tells pros,
cons of performance drugs

EMILY SCHMITZ
Staff Writer

This Thanksgiving marks the
13th anniversary of Steve
Courson’s decision to stop using
anabolic steroids. And according to
the former Pittsburgh Steelers line-

man, that’s a lot to be thankful for. V

“I was in the emergency room

about to be put on a heart transplant A

list,” Courson said. “I thought
_maybe [the steroids] weren’t worth
-it.’’ 9

Courson spoke yesterday in the

‘William Pitt Union about anabolic

steroid use. At 46, Courson’s 6-
foot-1-inch, well-muscled frame
belies a heart condition that he
attributes, at least in part, to steroid
use throughout his collegiate and
professional football careers. Upon
being hospitalized in 1988 for his
heart condition, Courson gave up
steroids and began dedicating him-
self to educating others. about ana-
bolic steroids.

/. Drawing upon his own experi-
ence with steroids, Courson pre-
sented a balanced View of the bene-
fits and the drawbacks of their use.
He said that his goal is to educate
people about steroids, not just to
present anti-steroids information.

He identified a number of per-
formance-enhancing drugs widely
used in professional athletics,
including human growth hormones,

amphetamines, erythopoietin, corti— -

costeroids and non—steroidal anti-
inflammatories. ~- According to

Courson, such drugs are used to

increase lean body mass, strength
and‘ the frequency of high-intensity
work, which together lead to better
athletic performance.

_ He also identified a number of
possible side effects of steroid use,
including masculinization of

women, the growth of breasts in
men and elevated blood pressure,
among other things. Despite these
side effects, Courson said the inci-
dence of dangerous or fatal effects
is relatively low. _ '

He ‘also highlighted the fact
that, in professional

is difficultto be competitive with-
out drugs. During his football
career, steroids were neither banned
from collegiate and professional
football nor were they illegal. The
university paid for the steroids he
used while playing football at the
University of South Carolina.

According to Courson, when
steroids didbecome ‘illegal in the
NFL, their use was “passively con-
doned” and the policy was “not
actively enforced.” »

“It was no big deal back then,”

, Courson said.
As the media and the public .

became more informed, steroid test-
ing became‘ standard at upper—level
athletic events. According to
Courson, the tests used are ineffec-
tive and do not detect a number of
commonly used performance-
enhancing drugs. He charged that
steroid testing at the professional

‘and Olympic levels is essentially a

public relations tool that has not
discouraged steroid use at all.

“To think that it’s not still going
on is very, very naive,l’ Courson
said. ..
Despite the drawbacks of
steroid use, Courson told the audi-
ence what many athletes" already
know — steroids work dramatically
well.

“If you train intelligently and
eat right you can become bigger and
stronger without drugs,” Courson
said. “You can’t get as big or as
strong without them, though.”

ties,” Nader said.

Both speakers related tales of their ‘

frustrating exploits in politics.
Buchanan recalled his Reform Party
campaign in 2000 in which “everything
went wrong” and a speciﬁc time when a
contingent of Perot supporters “dyna-
mited” his plans so effectively that he
“feels a certain sympathy for the
Taliban.”

Buchanan’s tales also included a
story of a conversation with God when
he feared that - his intervention in the
presidential race might result in the vic-
tory of Al Gore. '

“I’d be in a cave now in Afghanistan
[if that had happened],” he said.
Buchanan said he begged God not to let
him be the cause of a Democratic victo-
ry, and that God agreed.

“‘Lord, how’re you gonna do that?’
I asked. ‘Well,’ He said, ‘you know all
those nice Jewish folks in Palm Beach
County...’” Buchanan said to laughs
from the audience. '

But Nader was clearly the crowd’s
favorite, taking the stage to a standing
ovation and being interrupted by
applause on many occasions.

The two also agreed on the/similari-
ty of the major parties, and their dissat-

leadership.

' “The Republican party out of power
in Congress [before 1994] is superior to
the Republican party, frankly, in power,”
Buchanan said.

Nader called the choice between
Republican and Democrat “a provoca-
tive party that does nothing versus an
anesthetizing party that does nothing.”

Both speakers ended the debate with

messages to a room filled mostly with ‘

college students.

“It’s your generation’s time to put
your arm to the wheel of justice,” Nader
said, ending with the warning that “You

Muslim world because “they don’t
have a narrow visionthat compels
them to hate. They really want just
their due.” .

According to members of the
panel, a generalized oppression affects
many of these Middle‘Eastern nations
and the soft support can supercede
national boundaries.

The multinational structure of al
Qaeda, the fundamentalist terrorist
network believed to be responsible for
the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, makes them difficult
to combat with traditional methods,
according to Phil Williams, a professor
in the Graduate School of Public and

A International Affairs.

Williams said the attacks did not
require the support of any state.
Instead, their execution relied on
underground organization and Osama
Bin Laden’s considerable financial
resources — both signiﬁcantly more
difficult to target than .a traditional
national enemy.

“This was 19 guys, an operation
that cost lessithan a $1 million and
caused all this damage and despair,”

_ Williams said. ‘

According to Williams, the terror-
ist threat and Western response may
serve as the defining conﬂict of the
20th century.

“Even if we get bin Laden’s head
on a platter,” Williams said, “It’s not
going to stop [the threat.] We need to
be comprehensive.” .

Williams said_ he was generally
pleased with the Bush administration’s
response, but added that he did not

believe that pursuing a ballistic missile \
"defense system would increase domes-

tic safety.

He stressed the importance of

remaining vigilant for less traditional
forms of attack, saying that only 4 per-
cent of containers that enter the coun-
try are ever inspected. Williams said he
believed terrorist networks might have

5

i

access to nuclear materials that they-
could fashion into “crude radiological
weapons.”

Williamsclassiﬁed the threat that
al Qaeda represents as asymmetrical,
saying that 'as opposed to previous
conﬂicts, the United States now faces

an enemy that is significantly smaller. r

But citing the country’s vulnerability
to attacks on computer networks and
other critical infrastructures, he said
terrorist groups are able to turn relative
United States power advantage into a
disadvantage. ' .

In a recent defense department
brieﬁng,’ U.S. Secretary of Defense

 

Donald Rumsfeld quipped, “We aren’t
running out of targets — Afghanistan
is,” referring to the minimal infrastruc-
ture of the Middle Eastern nation. V

Lt. Col. Rand Miller, a U.S. Air
Force National Defense Fellow at
Ridgeway Center, referred to the com-
paratively primitive nature of Afghan
infrastructure, but said the military
could nevertheless identify targets
from among the agricultural and mili-
tary systems of Afghanistan.

Miller also said humanitarian aid
has been paralleled with the military
objectives that have targeted. Taliban

Foreign students are not liabilities

The United States has a higher edu-
cation system that attracts students from
almost everywhere on the planet. These
students enrich campus life wherever
they go, and the U.S. government encour-
ages their presence.

After the Sept. ll terrorist attacks and
the discovery that one of the alleged
hijackers, Hani Hanjour, had an expired
student visa, fears have mounted about
the ease of obtaining —-— and abusing --
student visas.

Yet, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service does not know
how many of the roughly 500,000 people
here with student visas are still students.

, Its tracking system is cumbersome,

bureaucratic and outdated —- it’s all done
on paper and isn’t even updated after the
person arrives in the country.

That will soon change.

The INS plans to upgrade to a com-
puterized database that will track people
with student-visas. The INS will be able
immediately to know a student’s status
from data from the school.

For example, if a student quits
school, the INS will know that he or she
has overstayed his or her visa and take
appropriate action within existing law.

If a student plans to study something
that could prove damaging to our inter-
ests, such as when an Iraqi scientist
involved in Saddam Hussein’s nuclear
weapons program secured a doctorate in

nuclear engineering from Michigan State,
the INS can know and take appropriate
action.

Obviously this data collection must
not go too far. It carmot make the stan-

dards for foreign students higher than

those for American students. It must not,
for example, track how often Beatriz,
Moharnrned and Gunther show up in
class and then cause the INS to deport
them for skipping their biology recitation
Tuesday morning.

Xenophobes should not use the ter-
rorist attacks as an excuse for curbing or
ending the tradition of bringing intema-
tional students to the United States to
study.

Studying in a foreign country is
mutually beneﬁcial. Foreign students
who study here receive top-notch educa-
tions that they can then take back to their
home counuies. American students who
study abroad learn ﬁrst-hand about other
people, other cultures and ways of think-
ing different from their own. Interaction

/among people from different back-

grounds, places and cultures can prevent
the petty misunderstandings that so often
lead to major conﬂicts. I

We must alsonot forget the number
of American students who choose to
study abroad every year, as perhaps other
countries will feel compelled to restrict
their student visas for us if we restrict ours
for their students.

John Ashcroft declares war on non-terrorists

For some politicians, the great thing

now been denied a source of pain relief

about a war is that people
are not paying attention to
things that don’t involve

invasions. Bad ideas, such
as building a missile

$100 billion in tax rebates to

“part of the war effort.” has instead been threatening

Even worse, some physicians who try to ‘show

politicians advanced their own personal
agendas because they are not part of the
war effort. Anything that does not ﬁght
terrorism or boost the "economy is not
newsworthy, and so is more likely to
sneak under the radars of the media and
public perception. _

No one has been enjoying this more
than Attorney General John Ashcroft.
Not only has the war given him leeway
to infringe upon rights like attorney-
client privilege, but it has also given him

free rein to advance his own personal,

religious agenda. More speciﬁcally, the

war on terrorism '*-has allowed Ashcroft ~

to declare his own rnini—war: the war on
the terminally ill.

It’s little secret that Ashcroft is
staunchly pro—life, both religiously and
politically. This belief applies not only

, to abortion and stem cell issues, but also

to assisted suicide and right—to-die
issues. Defying both his party’s belief in
state’s rights and his own oft—made
promise to not allow his religion to
affect his enforcement of the law,
Ashcroft recently tried to overturn an
Oregon state law, twice-approved by
voters, that allows doctors to assist in
the suicide of terminally ill patients.

On Nov. ,_ 6, Ashcroft, declaring that
assisted suicide is not a “legitimate med-
ical purpose” for prescribing or dispens-

ing lethal medications,‘ authorized feder- .
al drug agents to revoke the license of '

any doctor who prescribed lethal drugs

for their patients. Not only is this action

hypocritical for Ashcroft, who is usually
a ﬁrm believer in state’s rights, but it

_ \also takes power out of the hands of

those who understand this issue far
more clearly than any politician ever
could: terminally ill patients and their
physicians.‘ *
Ashcroft ’ is also not content ' with
just simply away the rights of dying
patients. Being "a good conservative

Christian and not letting hypocrisy ‘stand ‘

in the way of ideology, he apparently
also wants these patients to suffer.
Ashcroft recently sent federal )agents to
raid a Los Angeles center that supplied
marijuana to desperately ill people
under a California state law allowing
that drug’s use for medical purposes.
The center’s customers were tenni-
na1AIDS, and cancer patients, and have

compassion. The Justice Department
could be dealing with anthrax attacks,

in - as morphine and oxycontin. l

but has instead been stripping the rights
of patients with life—threatening dis-
eases, patients who should be most
exempted from petty politics -and per-
sonal beliefs.

These actions seem to be a response
to all the criticism the Justice
Department has received for its lack of
results in the terrorist investigations.
Pursuing easy targets in Oregon and
California may be a way ‘for the Justice
Department to offer quick results to con-
servative politicians and voters while
serving the personal beliefs of the
Attorney General. After all, it’s much
easier to bust a compassionate physician

or a marijuana using cancer patient than
it isjan elusive terrorist operating in the
shadows.

The Justice Department’s behavior
demonstrates the lowest form of govern-
ment laziness and pandering. It’s a

shame that the big issues of the war and '

economy have been so able to eclipse
these little issues, allowing small men
and their motivations to operate so
freely.

much during wartime as he does during
peacetime. He can be reached at derek-

Christianity betrayed ‘_

That’s all the Florida evange-
list on the corner of Forbes Avenue

and Bigelow Boulevard
Wednesday was doing.
V He misrepresented the

Christian faith, and I am angered
that he claims to speak the name of
Christ. ‘

Yes, _I am a Christian, but you
will never see me acting like that

 

cate the love and compassion of A

Jesus Christ. The street preacher
was not acting like an ambassador
of Christ. He seemed like a_ man

.foolish.

As a Christian, I am probably
more upset at his antics than most
non-Christians.

I questioned him on several
occasions just as the others did.
But instead, I berated his choice of
method and his lack of scriptural
knowledge.

Every student present knows
“he condemned the students on
campus to hell.” I have a big prob-
lem with him doing that. I am a
Christian student, and I believe
with allmy heart that my eternal
abode will be in Heaven. The
preacher was making gross gener-
alizations, which never amount to
a hill of beans. In fact, they under-
mined his integrity and knowl-
edge.

Moreover, he would take scrip-
tures out of Biblical context. By

doing so, he can make the Bible
say anything. Sadly, he did this to
accomplish his own preaching
agenda.

Just as the Taliban doesn’t rep-
resent Islam, he doesn’t represent
Christianity.

I apologize for his behavior.

Good things

Mock, page 6

The official organ of BAS, Blackline is a
periodical that has been ﬂoundering for

L far too long due to a lack of support and

participation from its black student con-

stituents.

It seems to me that Blackline can’t
realize its true potential because there are
too many dorm room revolutionaries
who’d rather whine than transcribe their
thoughts to help uplift the journal that is
supposed to represent them.

Nkaiso Akpabio, the Pitt senior who
hosted the talent show, admitted in the
aftermath of Black Week that “it’s up to
those black students who are writers or
who are journalists to ﬁll up those posi-
tions at The Pitt News or with Blackline.”

Bear in mind that you do not have to
be a journalism major to write for The
Pitt News. I-personally know more than a
few black students who are articulate and

. eloquent enough to come up here and put

my own job in jeopardy.

Let’s move beyond ranting for more
black professors — be the next black pro-
fessor. Move beyond rallying for more
black administrators — be the next black
administrator.‘ Let’s do more than simply
react to The Pitt News — be the reporter,
be the columnist, be the next editor-in-
chief. '

And I know that the possibility of
racism still looms above our heads in
today’s society. So, if you were to
encounter a problem like this...well, I
once read a story about some black stu-
dents and a computer lab.

French ﬁl/e crosses the pond

Amelie

(Le Fabuleux Destin d’Ame|ie
Poulain)

Starring Audrey Tautou

Directed by Jean—Pierre Jeunet _
vi‘n,“ri‘:i‘r

' LESLIE HOFFMAN -
A&E editor

Perhaps it isn’t fair for a young, female
French student to review “Amelie” when she
would eat her chapeau to live in a charming ﬁat
in Paris. A

But “Amelie,” — or “The Fabulous Destiny
of Amelie Poulain,” as it was released in France
— is not a stuffy French ﬁlm just for Francophiles
and ﬁlm students. Rather, it is a beautiful and
delightful ﬁlm that marks the journey of a young
woman as she heads out on her own to discover
life and love for herself.’

“Amelie” begins with the early life of Amelie
Poulain (Audrey Tautou) She grows up under the
watchful -and neurotic eyes of her schoolteacher
mother and her doctor father, who only touches
her during her monthly checkups. Amelie has no
friends, save for a suicidal goldﬁsh, and even he
disappears (though not by his own volition) early
in her childhood.

Amelie lives a solitary life until she’s old

enough to leave home to become a waitress in
Montmarte, and occupy a small ﬂat in the
Parisian neighborhood. Her life is normal until
she discovers a treasure hidden behind a tile in her
bathroom; a boy who lived in the ﬂat 50 years
prior had left behind a cigar box full of toys, pic-
tures and other mementos. ‘Amelie decides she
will find the man and return the box.

After ﬁnding the man to whom the box
belongs, Amelie becomes full of the joy of mak-
ing people happy and sets out on a-campaign to
bring happiness to everyone who crosses her path.

Except herself. I

Directed by Jean—Pierre Jeunet, who has also
directed “Delicatessen” (1991) and “The City of

Lost» Children” (1995), “Amelie” retains a similar '

certain timeless quality and an endearing atten-
tion to detail. Unique, beautiful and unexpected
special effects contrast with the ﬁlm’s vintage feel
and remind the audience that the film takes place
today. ,

The attention to detail reveals itself not only
in the objects ﬁlling the film’s view, but also in
the characters. themselves. From the neighbor
with “glass” bones who uses a video camera ﬁx-

ated on clock across the street to tell time, to the _

love interest that collects discarded photos from
photo booths, each character has been richly
developed throughout the film.

Amelie Poulain may be beautiful and unique,"

but there’s something in her we can all relate to --
eventually we all have to come to terms with who

we are in order to ﬁnd our own happiness and to '

fulﬁll our own fabulous destinies. ,

Next Friday, after you wake from.
your tryptophan—induced slumber, if
you’re like many Americans, you’ll head
to the mall for Black Friday, the con-
surner’s favorite holiday.

Department stores and shopping cen-
ters are already.preparing for it — they
stock up on merchandise and employees
for this busy day. It’s fun to go out the day
after Thanksgiving to start shopping; ‘

stores always have all kinds of specials
and sales. ‘

But what would happen if everyone

Pourquoi?

Leslie Hoffman

 

didn’t ﬂood the malls en masse? ,
Adbusters and Enough! magazines in Canada and England pro-
mote Buy Nothing Day instead.

This day exists to encourage shoppers to take a break. It doesn’t'

mean to live without heat, water or electricity. Rather, it encourages
people to spend time with their families, engage in anti-consumer
activism, or just do someﬂring instead of buying something. In the
past, anti-consumer activists have dressed up in pig noses and gone
on imaginary shopping sprees. They’ve also set up shop selling
“hope” and “happiness,” and have used the time to promote various
charities. It’s been celebrated in France and New Zealand in addition
to other Western countries. '

This year American politicians and economists tell us to just

keep spending in an effort to spur our lagging economy.
' But in ‘this isolated world it might not seem like it’s lagging at
all; college students may not be currently curbing their spending
habits. In fact, it’s enough of a challenge for many of us to go a day
without buying anything, regardless of whether i,t’sfood _,at a restau-
rant, a beer, an impulse purchase at the mall or something online.

Can you go a day without buying anything? .

Imagine it: wake up, check e-mail, avoid online advertisements,
eat breakfast at home, pack a lunch for later. At class or work you’re
safe -— no spending money here, unless of course someone.’-s
fundraising, or unless you want a snack in between classes. Meet
some ﬁiends for lunch and eat your lunches that you’ve brought
from home. Go home, do homework. Call some friends or your fam-

‘ ily. Hang out with people. - *
It’s feasible to last a whole day without directly spending -

money, but it’s diﬂicult.

Plus, spending money is ftm.

Who hasn’t found some sort of pleasure from finding a sweater
on sale at The Gap, or even something unique at a, thrift store? It’s
even ﬁm to spend a little money on something like a chocolate bar
or a cup of coffee or a meal at a restaurant. Who cares what you

it. -
Our culture also drills into our heads the value of the accumula-

tion of things. Why do we need so much stuff? Why does it feel so _

Participate in Buy Nothing. Day if you feel like you need a

New Steve Martin film
funny as root canal

Novocaine

Written and Directed David
Atkins

Starring Steve Martin, Helena
Bonham Carter and Laura Dern
ikik

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE
Staff Writer

It’s impossible to avoid the obvious
jokey application here, but indeed,
through a haze of over—explanation and
self—referentiality, “Novocaine” doesn’t
have a whole lot of feeling.

Writer-director David Atkins starts
“Novocaine” off arniably enough as an
attempt to update classic ﬁlm noir stylis-
tics. Steve Martin is Frank Sangster, an
ordinary guy with a dental practice. Jean
(Laura Dem), his all-American, color-
coordinated hygienist is his
wife. His life is fulﬁlling at
nearly every end; it is “the
perfect illusion,” he notes.
Then Susan Ivey (Bonham
Carter) shows up with a toothache.

Sangster’s voice-over and Susan’s
sexy femme fatale slinking make the
opening 15 minutes mildly promising
revisionist noir. But as the fﬂm rolls and
the ﬂow begins to bounce wildly
between the straight—faced and the dark-
ly comic, “Novocaine” quickly goes
numb.

Martin seems to be returning to his
long-lost love of genre ﬁlms, something
he was bent on tackling early on in his
career. “Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid”
(1982) was a slapstick nod to noir,
“Pennies From Heaven”(l981) a musi-
cal and “The Man" With Two Brains”
(1983), a sci-ﬁ ﬁlm. All were among his
first ﬁlms before he returned to his

comic day "job, but instead of injecting.

humor into noir this time around, in

 

Watch

“Novocaine” he seems keyed in to play-
ing it straight, a la “The Spanish
Prisoner” (1997). And it seems Atkins

headed in this direction as well, before -

his obsession with an unnecessary
metacinematic slant overtook his idea. '

Surprisingly, Martin comes i out 1

unscathed as the straight man in an over-
ly (and overtly) self-knowing ﬁlm. The
supporting cast does not fare so well.
Elias Koteas as Frank’s black-sheep
‘brother is wasted as a red
herring. Ditto for Scott
Caan as Susan’s sadistic
brother. But the lovely
Bonham Carter in particu-
lar is robbed of her performance by
Atkins’ direction, which seems to be one
step ahead of her Susan Ivey, undercut-
ting and rendering her character little
more than a cheap device for plot conve-
nience and ultimately, contiivance.
Overall, the only reason this ﬁlm
retains any sort of solidity is Steve
Martin, who, despite the ﬁlm’s labored
irony, gives a pretty good performance
as the ordinary, noirish patsy. But Atkins
is drawn toward the dark comedy angle,
while the joke seems lost on Martin.
Perhaps he ﬁnds his and the audience’s
knowledge of ﬁlm noir more interesting
or funny than updating the material. At
any rate, he is unsuccessful in keeping
the ﬁlm from becoming tiredly self-ref-

erential, making this effort an unmemo-

rable one.

Poe’s songs on Harmted are, admittedly,
hit-or-miss. They incorporate disparate ele-

the hard-house remix scene and sampled
renderings of her voice, but everything is
held down by a very organic backbeat (she

The strangest element of Haunted is her

liberal use of samples of her father’s voice.

John Wesley Harding

day of show

(412) 261-2221

John Wesley Harding is one of the best
singer/songvvriters you’ve never heard of
and,he’s coming to Oakland this Sunday.

Born Wesley Stace in Hastings,
England, he grew up listening to the likes of
David Bowie and the Beach Boys. He then
fme—tuned his sound and molded himself to
his inspiration, Bob Dylan, as his record-
ings prove.

After more than a decade of constant
touring, six critically acclaimed albums and
the song “I’m Wrong About Everything”
featured in the ﬁlm “High Fidelity,”
Harding is now poised to expand his small
but loyal fan base by- bringing his new-
school pop—folk sound to the masses.

Harding’s legendary underground
notoriety is a direct result of extensive
opening slots for such big names as Los
Lobos, Joan Baez, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and
the usually solo tours of Bruce Springsteen.

THE Pm? NEWS

This time Harding has decided to take
it to the road on his own tour, headlining
smaller venues with material from his lat-
est, well—received album, The Confessions
of St. Ace.

The Confessions of St. Ace shows why
Harding has created, and still is creating
such a buzz for his music. '

With standout tracks like the afore-
mentioned “I’m Wrong About .
Everything,” plus “You In Spite of
Yourself,” “Our Lady of the Highways”
and “Humble Bee,” it’s easy to see how
Harding’s broad style can incorporate folk
lyrics with everything from rock riffs to
merry melodies.

V But while many compare him to
Morrissey and Elvis Costello, these com-
parisons do Harding a disservice by brand-
ing him simply with the title 0 “another” or;
“the next.” ’

On Sunday, anticipate tracks from the
newest release as well as older material to
round out the must-see intimate concert.
Expect to hear the sound that has attracted
so many devoted followers, and just ‘like
the religious title ﬁom his latest effort,
expect yourself to be converted into one of
Harding’s faithful disciples. '

Michael Swedberg and Catherine

nearly 200 days on the road and gives

With Five by Design’s reputation
growing, the Baltimore Symphony
approached themfto create “Club
Swing,” which completed by early
2000. The group meticulously
researched the project, spending
countless. hours in vintage clothing

cally matching the fashion periods
from 1937-1955. ,

_ “Oh, we have lots of costumes,”
Farr-Scott said, laughing. “I have 17,

personally.”

Even with 25 songs, the show is
not a nonstop musical. It tells the
very definite story of an elderly

man’s remembrance of his youth and

of how a resurgent interest in swing
could lead to the rebirth of the club.
Additionally, some of the musical
numbers (intentionally) break down
into confusion.

“We do a piece by Spike Jones —
the Weird A1 of the swing era —- that
just goes crazy,” Farr-Scott said.

Farr-Scott has noticed many col-
lege-age students at their shows, an
occurrence that she partially credits
to the recent return of swing music.
Perhaps, though, there is an’ even
simpler reason for their popularity.

“People really just seem to have a
lot of fun with it '—— it’s for any age,

whether you’re six or seven up to 80. 

or 90,”she said. ’

THE BEST PIA CE FOR P177 SPORTS NEWS  

Basketball teas open play tonight

. BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Remember the run? Where will you be for the next one?
That is the slogan leading into the 2000-2001 men’s basket-
ball season.

The season starts tonight when the Panthers take on
Morgan State at 6 p.m. at the Fitzgerald Field House.

Retuming starters include guard Julius Page, forward
Donatas Zavackas, guard/forward Jaron Brown, center
Toree Morris and starting point guard Brandin Knight. '

Page is only a sophomore and is most famous for his -

dunk in Washington, D.C., over. Georgetown’s 7—foot-tall
center Ruben Boumtje-Bourntje, a game in which Pitt hand-
ed the Hoyas. their ﬁrst loss of the season." He showed the
ability to score during the preseason, but was unable to hit the
three-point shot going 1-9 against the United States
Developmental Basketball League All-Stars .

Junior forward Zavackas hit 49 percent of his three-

point attempts last season. During the preseason this year, . , 7

Zavackas continued to show he could hit the three, but he
also has showed that he has cut down on turnovers.

‘Junior guard Knight got off to a~slow start last season
after being arrested before the season started. This year,
Knight will be with the team from the beginning. He has

, improved on his shooting, but will still be the assist man on

this Panther team. Knight had the strongest preseason of any
Panther, showing the ability to post near triple-double num-
One big question for the Panthers is who will ﬁll the

center position. VV1th the loss of Issac Hawkins, Toree Monis

and transfer Ontario Lett will ﬁll the role of big man. Both
players will have to be elfective on the glass as the Panthers

were outmatched and out-hustled on both the offensive and '

defensive boards last season. A
1 "Morris, a 6-foot-10-inch, 282-pound man, will most

- likely get the starting role. He now has a year of experience

to his credit. Monis didn’t show much improvement  pre-

‘ season inhis post-up game or rebormding, putting up only
. -eight points and only two rebounds against USDBL. *

BRANDON WALOFF/‘ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR ‘

Jaron Brown returns for his second season. Brown
will play guard and forward for the Panthers.

Redshirt freshnran Chevy Troutrnan was one of Pitt’s
highly touted recruits from two years ago. His job will be to
relieve Morris when needed and supply a little quickness
down low, at either the power forward or center position.

‘Head coach Ben Howland is bringing the young
Troutman along slowly as he played just 11 minutes against
USDBL. .

Brown returns as one of the most improved Panthers.
Last year, his diversiﬁed play helped the Panthers succeed
throughout the postseason. Brown showed during the pre-
season that he can still hit the jumper, going '6-9 agains
USDBL and retrieving seven rebounds. -

After the men’s game, the Pit women’s basketball team
begins its season against William & Mary, at 8 p.m. at the

Field House. a

After a- 16-13 1999-2000 season and an Nl.T birth, the
Panthers went 9-18 last season. i

This year brings promise and a more experienced team

The backcourt consists of three returning juniors, Laine
Selwyn, Brooke Stewart and Dallas Wﬂlianrs.

Selwyn will be the team’s starting point guard Last year,
Selwyn averaged 4.63 assists per game,’ and was second on
the team averaging 11.4 points per game. V

Stewart is the team’s shooter. She made the most three-
pointers per game in the Big East Conference (2.31) last sea-
son. She is also one of the best defenders on the team.

Williams is -coming off an injury-ﬁlled 2000-2001 sea-
son. She only played sparingly in 15 games last season, and
is still trying to recover from a knee injury sustained two
years ago. '

Also sharing time at guard will be seniors Bettina Love,
Jackie Campbell and Jessica Ryndycz.

Starting center for the Panthers will be their most explo-
sive player from last season, Mandy Vlfrttenmyer.
Vlrrttemnyer averaged 12.4 points per game, and 8.4
rebounds as a sophomore last season. This year, Vvrttenmyer
has added a rnid-range jumper and is expected to be the team
leader. ‘

The other forward will be Sheila Stuﬁlet. Stuﬁlet, a
sophomore, will be a ﬁrst time starter this season. Last year
Stuﬁlet helped Pitt off the bench averaging 7.8 points per
game. . . ‘

The Panthers also did their fair share of recruiting this
summer, adding three guards and a forward to their roster
this season. Amy Kunich (Oakland Catholic High), Jessica
Allen (New London High, Salem, Conn.), and Haley
Harguth (Beaverton High, Beaverton, Ore.) make up the
guards. Allisha Monis (Hampton High, Hampton, Va.) is the
only forward recruit. .

The Panthers schedule is a tough one this season. They
will play at Cancun, Mexico, and Tluscon, Ariz. in touma-
ments. They will also face two of the best teams in the coun-
try in the NCAA Champions Notre Dame and top-‘ranked
Connecticut.

Rachel Brown was chosen as the Big East
preseason Goalkeeper of the Year in July and

last week Brown proved to live up to expec- V

tations, by again being named Goalkeeper of
the Year during the regular season at the
armual championship banquet. ‘

This is Brown’s second time receiving
ﬂie honor. The senior won the award last
year in her ﬁrst season with the ‘Panthers.

“It is certainly an honorto be chosen for
a second year,” she said. “The team got a lot
better this season and it feels good to have
been a part of it.” .

Brown joined the Panthers before the
2000 season, after transferring from the
University of Alabama. In 2000 she surren-
dered less than two goals a game on average.
Her 1.73 goals against average stands as a

school record.

Brown, a co—captain this season, missed
the Panthers’ ﬁrst four_ games of the season
with a sprained MCL (medial collateral liga-

pment). She retumed to start in the team’s
. ﬁnal 13 games, debuting in a 2-1 victory

over Georgetown.

Brownwas 5-7-1 in her 13 games, with

a 2.03» goals-against average. Brown fol-
lowed her strong debut against Georgetown,
with a scoreless double overtime game
against No. 21-ranked Auburn, in which she
made nine stops. .

Some of her other season highlights
include tying a school record of 16 saves in
the ﬁnal game. of the season against Penn
State and a 2-1 win over No. 24-ranked

 rown namedGoalkeeper of the Year by BigEast

She left Alabama as the all—time single
season saves leader with 142 in a season and
she’ll leave Pitt with the record for least
goals allowed in a career as well as the goals-
against mark .

Brown is the only Panther women’
soccer player to be selected to be a confer-
ence player of the year. _i

“She is a very talented goalkeeper that
kept us in a lot of games,” head coach
Roland Sturk said “We will certainly miss
her athleticism and leadership in goal next
year.”

Other career highlights for Brown
include being named to the South Eastern
Conference’s All-American Tournament
Team as a freshman and as an all-SEC selec-
tion in 1998 and 1999.

Shaffer running past Skeptics and competitors

~ SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt freshman and cross country
runner Lauren Shaffer can’t seem to
remember last year’s Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League Championship race. She was
the defending state champion, and
somehow she didn’t even place high
enough in the regional race to qualify
for the state meet.

“I don’t really know what hap-
pened,” said Shaffer, 18, who was a
senior at West Allegheny High School
at the time.

A lot of colleges that had come
calling weren’t interested in trying to
solve that mystery and stopped pursu-
ing Shaffer, but Panther head coach

* Waddie Freeman quickly assured

Shaffer that Pitt wasn’t one of them.

“Coach Freeman called me and
said that the WPIAL race doesn’t real-
ly matter,’_’ Shaffer said. “He still had
faith in me and still wanted me to
come [to Pitt].”

After that race and that phone
call, Shaffer disappeared for a while.

“I was talking to some of my

teammates [from West Allegheny] last _

Saturday, and they were like, ‘What
happened to you? You were gone for
six weeks,”’ Shaffer said.

Whatever Shaffer did during that
time, it was evident that it worked
when she came back to win the 3,000
meters at the state indoor track cham-
pionships a few months later.

Shaffer was back at the top, and
suddenly all those colleges that gave
up on her were looking like they made
a hasty decision.

Shaffer, who is considering
majoring in biology, came to Pitt and
was one of the main reasons the
women’s team had its best season
ever this year. . V

In her first meet as a Panther, the
Duquesne Dual Meet in Schenley
Park back on Sept. 8, Shaffer took
second place as Pitt completed a 1-2-
3 sweep, with senior Amanda Schmidt
taking first and _freshman Maureen
McCandless taking third.

“It set a nice tone for the season. I
knew it was kind of a littler meet, but
it was a‘ nice start,” Shaffer said.

As_ the season progressed, so did
the competition. So did Shaffer.

At the Paul Short Invitational, at
Lehigh University, she placed 21st
and Pitt finished sixth. At the Big East
Championships, she finished 43rd,
and the team took seventh as Pitt fin-
ished in the upper tier of the confer-
ence for the first time in a while.

Lehigh, Pa., Shaffer took 33rd in the
NCAA regional meet, the second
highest finish in Pitt history. '

Shaffer actually started running
with no other intention than to make
some friends after her family moved
from Greensburg-Salem, N.C., before
her sophomore year of high school.
She ran with her father during the
summer, then went out for _the team
that fall. '

The trouble was she was still run-
ning alone, since no one on her team
could keep up with her.

In her first race ever, a small com-
munity race held near West Allegheny
every year, Shaffer took second.

“One of West Allegheny’s alumna
beat me,” Shaffer said. “She was run-
ning for Youngstown State at the
time.”

Shaffer’s'high school coach tried
to get her to slow down during prac-
tice, to stay with the rest of the girls,
but she couldn’t. When the coach
went on vacation’, the West Allegheny
boys invited her tg run with them.

‘ “They knew I could keep up, so
when my coach came back I was run-
ning with the guys,” "Shaffer said.

By the end of her first year, she
was second in the state. By the end of
her second, she was state champion.

-.Now, Shaffer is one of the best run-

ners in the Big East.

But she’s had some help- One of
her biggest motivators is her room-
mate, McCandless, who came to Pitt
with a similar story and just complet-
ed a similarly successful season.

“I really like running with Lauren,
because at my high school I didn’t
really have a team to run with,” said
McCandless, who was a staroin cross
country and track at
Academy in Philadelphia. “It’s gotten
me into the best shape that I’ve ever
been in.”

Although Shaffer and
McCandless never actually met
before coming to Pitt, now “people
joke that we’re joined at the hip,
because we’re always together,”
Shaffer said. . '

Barring any unforeseen problems,
the two will be together for the next

Nazereth

four years and could bring the‘

women’s team to prominence as it
progresses. ‘

As for the short term, the ‘indoor
season starts today, and Shaffer will

_ concentrate on the 3,000 meter race. A

“ And maybe in the summers to
come, her dad will still keep her com-
pany as she runs.

“I’m alittle faster than himinow, ‘

so he rides a bike,” Shaffer said. “But
it’s nice, because it gets lonely.”
