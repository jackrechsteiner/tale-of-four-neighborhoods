Daniel Spisak Jr. doesn’t like to
look in the mirror anymore.

He doesn’t want to see his face..

Spisak can’t concentrate; he doesn’t
attend college, and he hasnlt worked
for nearly a year. He spends most of
the day inside his McKees Rocks
home. Nightmares keep him awake at
night so he sleeps most of the mom-
rng. .
“Every time I walk into a room, I5
feel like everyone is watching me,”
said Spisak, 19, rubbing the left side
of his face. “I can still feel that there’s
something there.” _

Spisak feels the titanium‘ chain
drilled into his cheekbone and the tiny
screws that hold it in place.

“If I don’t massage it,” Spisak

said, “the skin sags down. It looks like _

I got beat up.”

Spisak didn’t always shy away
from his reﬂection; he also didn’t
always have medical hardware ‘hold-
ing hispface together.

At an Oakland house party a year
ago, Spisak nearly died when a group

* of partygoers ‘beat and robbed him.

Two suspects, Jesse Matthews and
Thomas Berta, are. charged in the.
assault and await trial Jan. 29. Berta
declined to comment for this story and
Matthews’ attorney failed to return
two phone calls.

With the trial four months away,
Spisak and his father said they want to
ensure a court victory. Spisak_’s father,
Daniel Spisak Sr.,i printed ﬂiers asking"
for witnesses to ‘the assault to come
forward and distributed them through-
out South Oakland. The ﬂiers are
posted outside Take 2 Video on Bates
Street and outside Mad Mex on
Atwood Street. They give information
about the party and a phone number
people can call with responses.

“I’m hoping’ through [the ﬂiers],

and anything else I can dream up, we
can find more witnesses,” Spisak’s
father said. “I want justice — I want
him to be able to sleep at night.”
According to Spisak, the night he
was’ beaten he tried to help a friend.

PHOTO COURTESY THI-3 SPISAK FAMILY

Daniel Spisak Jr. spent the days follow-
ing the attack in Ul’MC Presbyterian.

Spisak was at home when his
friend called and invited him to go to
a party on Semple Street in South
Oakland. Spisak said he doesn’t typi-
cally drink and didn’t want to be
around people drinking, but he acqui-
esced and went to the party.

“As soon as I got there,” he said,
“I wish I’d drove.” .

Spisak was uncomfortable at the
crowded party. When the beer ran out
and the party started to split up,
Spisak said he searched for the friends
he had come with. One of them was
missing.

Spisak went outside to ﬁnd him.
When he did, Spisak found a circle of
angry people surrounding his friend.

.He went inside to tell- his; other-

friends.
“I said ‘Our friend.’s_ in trouble,’
and they gave‘ me a look like, -‘can’t

help ya. -V
Spisak went back outside expect-

’ ing to diffuse the situation.

According to the Oct. 25, 2000,
city police report, Spisak handed his
coat to a friend and approached the
circle of people. He then grabbed one
of the men and pushed him away.

“I said, ‘Leave my friend alone,

please. .

How do you decide who’son top during

For approximately an hour and a half
Tuesday night, ﬁve members of Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance voluntarily subjected-
themselves to these and oﬂrer such questions
during a panel discussion. Audience mem-
bers could ask any question, either aloud or
anonymously by writing them on slips of
PaPeT- ‘ '
After a few minutes of silence and some
giggling, the 31 attendees dug in, asking
everything they always wanted to lmow

. about gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgen-

dered people but were afraid to ask
The audience was curious about every-
thing from exactly what constitutes sex

between two women to belief in "God.

‘ Andrea ,DeChellis, panel member and‘

Campus Wornen’s Organization president,
said, “ItalktoGodallthetimeandshe’spro-

HUGH BURGOON/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Seniors Dennis Coah and Kate Burgo sample some of the many brews at Pitt
Program Council’s beer tasting seminar last night.

Students find true beer love

Prohibition came to an end in the
United States in the 1930s just as mass com-
mercialization of products began to emerge,
Knipling said In order to remain competi-
tive, beer producers had to cut costs.

According to Knipling, cutiing costs
often meant using cheaper ingredients such
as corn or rice in addition to the standard
mix of barley, hops,‘ water and yeast. .

Knipling and Gary Kunes — both
members of the Three Rivers Alliance of
Serious Brewers -— said none of the beers
they served contained corn or rice.

As students sampled the various beers,
Knipling placed the beverage in its histori-
cal context.

Tracing the existence of beer back to

Sumerian civilization, Knipling said beer ’

has formed an important dietary component
since its invention, although the beer then
might have been “more like food than
drink” 2

“It was a porridge-type thing,” he said.

Knipling also suggested that the pil-
grims landed at Plymouth Rock rather than
continuing on to Virginia because they ran
out of beer. Knipling said at the time of their
voyage, water would spoil in wooden casks,
but, by virtue of the alcohol, beer would not

Continuing his lecture, Knipling
described a nearly inﬁnite variety of beers.

According to Knipling, beer brewing
leaves more of the outcome in hands of the
brewers than wine does in the hands of wine

“God gives you‘ good grapes and you
crush them,” he said “With brewing tl1ere’s
more creativity.” _

Knipling said brewers can combine the
four principal ingredients, which can be
taken from a wide range of sources and han-
dltxl or treated in many different ways, to
create a beer with its own unique character-
istics. . A

By the end of the evening, Kolb said
she found a beer she liked better than most
— Railbender Ale, from the Erie Brewing
Co. in Erie, Pa.

Firefighters bring fire

JAMES DEWEESE
Senior Staff Writer

For about 20 seconds, freshman

Shaun Lally struggled through a thick I

haze of smoke, slowly crossing the 10
feet that separated him from daylight.

The smoke—fil1ed tent on the
William Pitt Union lawn that Lally
willingly entered yesterday -— part of
Pitt’s 10th Annual Fire Safety Day —
simulated the disorienting effects that
accompany a fire in a small, confined
area like a dorm room.

As Lally emerged from behind
the plastic tarp covering the tent’s

exit, he said it was more difficult to '
find his‘ way out than he_ would have

thought.
“I couldn’t see,” he said. “It’s

- .hard to imagine. If that was a dorm

room I’d be out of luck.’’

Fire inspector Bill Cable said that
for all its realism, the tent was much
easier to escape from than a dorm
room fire would be.

.“That’s just theatrical,” Cable
said. “Remember, in a real situation,
your head’s going to burn, your
throat’s going to clog and your eyes
are going to burn.” 1'

Cable said that in the event of a
fire in a confined area where smoke
obscures vision, students should

place a hand along a wall to avoid I

becoming disoriented and proceed
quickly to the nearest exit.

Firefighters and University offi- '

cials offered similar advice to other

[students who attended the campus

CVCIIL

tives from Pitt’s department of envi-
ronmental health and safety staged

_ the- event. Organizers distributed ﬁre

safety pamphlets, free batteries for
smoke alarms and free T-shirts. ~

At the event, students ‘learned not
only how to escape fires, but how to
extinguish them properly as well.

Bob Walker, a lieutenant with the
Pittsburgh fire department, encour-
aged passing students to try their
hand at extinguishing a grease ﬁre
that he periodically reignited with a
propane torch.

Junior Felicia Hicks approached
the flames hesitantly. .

“Even in a box, you see the [ﬁre]
taking on ‘a life of its own,” ‘Hicks

said. But she said she will remember

at least Walker’s advice about the
proper use of fire extinguishers.

Walker offered a pneumonic.

admonition to those students who
might need to use an extinguisher:

In another corner of the Union
lawn, organizers arranged charred
remnants of dormroom refrigerators,
a melted oscillating fan, a burnt
stereo and an alarm clock that will
never again ensure any student’s
punctual arrival at class.

Rick Schultz, of the environmen-
tal health and safety department, said
all of the items‘ on display once
served as the ignition point for ﬁres
that occurred on campus, adding that
the blackened remains seemed to
make more of an impression on stu-
dents than the previous year’s fire
safety video.

While many of the items that
were featured could appear in any
typical college dorm room, Schultz
pointed out that some of the fire-pro-
voking items, such as toaster ovens,

were prohibited by University policy.»

Cable said the key to surviving a
ﬁre in a dorm room or elsewhere is to
respond to every ﬁre alarm quickly.

. Not everyone does, according to
Lally, who said he knows-« of many
students who sometimes don’t pay
attention to alarms because of the fre-
quency with which alarms are trig-
gered when there is no fire. .

Cable acknowledged that alarms
are sometimes activated falsely, cit-
ing Litchfield ‘Towers as an example,

. but he said, “You don’t know when

the real one’s going to happen.”

er and then someone’s ﬁst.

“Instead of just one kid coming at
me, everyone came at me,” Spisak
said.

The police report said the attack-
ers beat, kicked and stomped Spisak.

Spisak said that according to a
woman who witnessed the ﬁght, a
large man was jumping on Spisak’s
face, while others in the group came
forward and kicked him as he lay on
the pavement.

Someone ripped Spisak’s gold

chain from his neck and took his gold
bracelet. The leather bomber jacket
Spisak left with his friend was not
recovered. ’

The friends who took Spisak to
the party called an ambulance and
then left. Spisak said the driver of the
car decided he was too bloody to go in
her car. .

Spisak said he woke to the sound
of an ambulance. At first, he thought
someone poured beer all over him and
wondered why he was all wet. When
Spisak realized it was his blood that
soaked his shirt, he got into the ambu-
lance.

“I remember screaming my "moth.-
er’s name and my phone number,”
Spisak said. “They thought I was

. crazy. I just wanted someone at the

hospital I knew.” .

The paramedics took Spisak to '

UPMC Presbyterian. He was admitted
with a broken nose, left cheek and left
eye bone. T.

It took hours of reconstructive “

surgery to restore Spisak’s face, but ‘a
deeper pain persists. ,

Spisak’s father wants to see justice
done. “The ‘sooner we go through
court,” he said, “the sooner the heal-
ing starts.”

The panel included two gay men, two

Kerianne Ludwig, ofﬁce administrator r

for Rainbow Alliance, opened the discus-

* sion with a warning.

“We tried to get as_diverse a sample as

I we could, but ﬁve people is just that, a sam-

ple,” Ludwig said. She said that no group
could fully represent all the diversity in the
GLBT community. —

Officers of Rainbow Alliance elected
panelists for this event Vice president and
panel member Adelairia Acosta stressed the
need for diversity in die panel because it was
meant to “pander to the entire university.”

Rainbow has been giving similar panel
discussions throughout the semester in

. freshman studies classes anddorms. Acosta

said the Pitt police and the Engineering
Mentors program have expressed interest in
hosting panels.

Rainbow president Sandra Telep. said
the panels are meant to “make a bridge”
between the gay and straight communities
on campus.

Ludwig was disappointed by her per-

ception ﬂiat few ﬁaternity and sorority ’

members attended the discussion. She said
ﬂiers promoting the event had been sent to
various Greek organizations including the
Interfiatemity Council and the Panhellenic
Association. ' I

“It would have been great to see some
people with [Greek] letters on,” Telep said
of the audience. '

Panel members shared their comingout
stories. When Telep fearfully told her father
she was a lesbian, he replied, “Yeah, honey,

A Iknow.”.

Josh Ferris, panel member and political
action chair for Rainbow, said, “My mom
cried, my dad stared and I think we got some
food or something.”

Most of the panel members said they

I . were out to their,fa_milies and friends and,

selectively, their co—Workers. _
Several sexually explicit questions pro-

voked peals of laughter from the audience

and panelists. Despite some blushing faces,

_ “It Went really well,” Ferris said.

  Bureaucracy proves
accommodating to students

Normally when students move off
campus, they can’t move back on.
Typically this is fine, as most students
who live off campus do so by choice.
But circumstances can change.
Luckily, the University is willing to
accommodate -these circumstances.

Last Sunday morning, the resi-
dence at 313 Meyran Ave. burned ~
allegedly by firebombing — and the
fire quickly spread to three other
houses. Thankfully, all the residents —
mostly students — got out of the hous-
es on time.

Some owe their lives to their
neighbors. Even though many of them
were likely strangers, they pulled
through for each other in a desperate
situation. These people should serve
as an example for us all.

Luckily as well, the fire was
detected quickly. This should remind
all of us that fires can happen at any
time, and we need to be alert to this
possibility.

Although they were lucky simply
to be alive, many of the students lost
everything they owned. And, of
course, they were left without places
to live. The Red Cross, as it typically
does for fire victims, accommodated

them in hotel-s for a few nights.

But then the University agreed to
give them accommodations — free of
charge — for two weeks until they find
new places to live.

And _to top that off, the University
also agreed to allow the students to
stay on—campus at pro—rated costs
afterthose two weeks.

_The generosity the University
showed in this unfortunate situation is
commendable.

While bureaucracy often seems
inﬂexible and students sometimes feel
like mummies wrapped in red tape,
the bureaucracy showed itself willing
and able to deal with the situation.

Rather than saying the students’
housing guarantees had expired and
denying’ them housing or charging
them for staying in the residence
halls, the University showed ﬂexibili-
ty in giving the students housing
options.

Because of the University’s gen-
erosity, these students can resume
their normal lives more quickly. They
are alive and they are also not home-
less. By accommodating these stu-
dents, the University exemplified a
commitment of service to its students.

Celebrating Coming Out Day

PATRIC LEWIS
Newsmaker

Editor’s note: The following was submit-
ted by a student leader who is playing a
role in a campus event. Newsmaker
columns will appear periodically in The
Pitt News. '

Today, Oct. 11, marks the anniver-

' sary of the second march in Washington,

D.C., for gay and lesbian equality. This
anniversary celebration of the 1987

march has become the Human Rights-

Campaign’s holiday, National Coming
Out Day.

Today marks the 13th year that gay,
lesbian, bisexual, transgendered and their
supporters have rallied for gay and les-
bian rights throughout the United States.

, National Coming Out Day acknowl-
edges and celebrates the struggle for gay,
lesbian, bisexual and transgendered, or

GLBT, people to live their lives normal-

ly. The basic premise lies in that men and
women of any sexual or gender orienta-
tion should not be forced to fear doing
something as simple as kissing their
same-sex date goodbye or casually com-
plimenting someone, much less more
radical forms of expression like wearing
gender-incongruent clothing.

While sexual and gender orientation
are essentially private things, and they are
legitimately ‘ only important in certain
limited circumstances, the current United
States and world culture does not foster
such an attitude.

As a result, GLBT people must be

' “out and proud” to show the world that

we really do exist, that we are not the hor-
rible people that hate-mongers make us
out to be and that we represent a normal

expression of human diversity.

While it is certainly easy to admit
that not all people will agree with these
ideas, the purpose of the GLBT rights

Patric Lewis is the Webmaster of
Rainbow-Alliance.

movement and National Coming Out
Day is to create tolerance and acceptance
despite people’s perceived or apparent
objections. It is a time to celebrate every-
one’s identity and its increasing accep-
tance the world over. '
This begs the question, though, as to
why people celebrate the process of pub-
licly _ identifying oneself as non—hetero-

sexual at all. Actually, the question has

been asked from the start. The impor-

tance of making this bold statement, of

making public what is essentially a pri-

vate matter, lies in that activism requires

public figures and public acknowledge-,
ment. To put it another way, it is practi-

cally impossible to run a public move-

ment anonymously.

Suppose that a person is supportive
of GLBT rights and wants to be involved
with such events as National Coming Out
Day, but he or she does not know how.
Well, this year the Rainbow Alliance at
Pitt has a’ great deal to oﬁer. The speaker
on gender’ issues, Daphne Scholinski,
gave a presentation on Monday and a
panel presentation to reach out to the
straight community was held Tuesday
night. With other events as well, includ-
ing an art show and a Melissa Ferrick
concert, there are plenty of possibilities
available to celebrate National Coming
Out Day.

On a more personal level, although it 1

is usually not necessary to come out as
heterosexual, it_ can be a true show of sup-
port to stand up on behalf of friends, rel-

atives and even total strangers who are ‘

GLBT. Put an HRC sticker (a yellow
equals symbol on a blue background) on
your door or car bumper, avoid using the
too common slurs like “that’s so gay” or
volunteer with a local GLBT supportive
organization. ‘

Being straight is no excuse for intol-
erance, and while National Coming, Out
Day may onlyhappen once a year, it can
and should continue in spirit through peo-
ple’s actions and words throughout the
entire year and their entire lifetimes.

True, Ichiro, Boone and Edgar Martinez
make up a damn good lineup, but when you
look at the Mariners more closely, they won
116 games because when they needed to win a
game 1-0 or needed a close game closed out in
the ninth, the pitching was there.

The Mariners, despite their loss to the

pitching all season.

Yanks’ charge in the postseason. Andy Pettitte is in the same
boat when it comes to experience. He has been there for the
Yankees for the last three World Series runs and will be
there once again this season.
The newest addition to the Yankees’ postseason roster
is Mike Mussina. Mussina doesn’t have the experience of_
. Clemens or Pettitte, but in the two years he was in the play-

record for the year, his numbers closely match up to
Clemens’ numbers in ERA, strikeouts and innings pitched.

N o slowing down the   Orangemen

Last week was- my first losing
week of the season as I went 2-3,
bringing my record to a mediocre 12-
11. But let’s face it, being near even is
much better than some people I know
who are constantly draining their bank
accounts.

Michigan and Notre Dame pulled
through for me last week while East
Carolina, Ohio and Iowa spoiled my
weekend.

Syracuse (-3 1/2) at Pitt

10 points in its last four games and has
an average margin of victory of 13
points.

Colorado State’s offense
absolutely miserable. The team lost at
Louisville last week 7-2 and quarter-
back Bradlee Van Pelt has only thrown
for more than 100 yards once this sea-
son. Last week he was picked off three
times. The team doesn’t have much of
a running game either.

look at the more than 300

close game as proof that the team
knows how to pull out a win in a tough
situation. But it didn’t hurt that
Rutgers’ kicker Steve Barone missed
four field goals and an extra point. ,
Syracuse head coach Paul
Pasqualoni said he was worried that

 ' tough games early in the season against

Georgia Tech and Tennessee might
have bumped up his team, and that
could be a solid explanation for the
team’s performance last week.

Even though the Orangemen
played poorly, running back James
Mungro came up with his usual 23 car-
ries for 140 yards. Kyle Johnson, his
partner in the backfield, ran for 96
yards on just six carries last week.

Dwight Freeney moved his sack
streak to 14 consecutive games last
week. _

This year’s team has many of the
same components as last year’s team,
which beat Pitt 24-17 in double over-
time. Syracuse hasn’t lost to Pitt in
more than 10 years.

Quarterback David Priestley has
thrown for more than 200 yards just
once this season. Pitt rushed for 50
yards on 26 carries last week and there
have been a slew of questions sur-
rounding the offense.

Not that I would ever really bet on
a Pitt game because you never know
which team will show up, but until this
team shows some sort of consistency, I

- would not take them.

Syracuse is on a roll and there is no
reason for me to believe that this year’s
Pitt squad can do any better than last
season’s team. Let’s "hope that I’m
wrong. _ .

Syracuse 27, Pitt 20

Fresno State (-7) at Colorado State
I’m going with the numbers on this

one. FSU, not the corrupt program

down south, has not won by fewer than

 

yards in three
out of his five
opportunities this season, and Gaines

rushed for 203 yards last week against .

Louisiana Tech. He can also catch the
ball out of the backfield.

I’ll. give Colorado State an extra
three points this week.
Fresno State 24, Colorado State 5

Wake Forest (-21/2) at Duke

Last week Duke head coach Carl

Franks saved a man from a, sports util-
ity vehicle that was submerged in
water. Unfortunately he has been
unable to save his team from being
embarrassed in almost every game this
season. .
Duke might have the worst football
program in Division I-A football. The
team is 0-5, with three of its losses
coming at home, and the team has lost
by an average of 25 points per game.

Although Wake Forest is only 2-3,
it has played some stiff competition,
hanging with Maryland and playing
competitive ball against Florida State.

Wake Forest running back Tarence
Williams is a workhorse. Williams
averages 25 carries per game and he
has rushed for more than 100 yards in
every game, with the exception of the
Florida State affair.

Duke quarterback D. Bryant has
thrown for more interceptions than
touchdowns, and I don’t see Duke
picking up its first win this season.
Wake Forest 20, Duke 10

Rutgers at Temple (-.11)

- When I see Temple being favored
by 11 points, I just have to jump at the
opportunity. ‘

This is definitely the worst game of
the year within the Big East. The teams
are a combined 2-7 and the game is
being played at Veterans Stadium, so
you know there will be at least 5,000

is-

people there.

Temple has lost three games in a
row,‘ and freshman quarterback Mike
McGarm might be out with a sprained
thumb. Mac DeVito is his replacement
 enough said.

Rutgers came very close to upset-
ting Syracuse last week. Freshman
quarterback Ryan Cubit passed for 224
yards and made good use of tight.end
L.J. Smith and receiver Aaron Martin,
who’s averaging 17 yards per catch.

Rutgers gave up 354 rushing yards
to Syracuse last week, but the defense
shouldn’t worry about Temple’s run-
ning game too much. Besides his 80
yards against Boston College last
week, running back Tanardo Sharps
has not been effective.

Sharps’ accomplice in the back-
field, Jason McKie, has rushed for 33
yards in his last three games. .

I’m taking Rutgers to cover in this
nail biter. »

Temple 17, Rutgers 10

Nebraska (-33) at Baylor

There’s not a lot of scientific
research needed forxthis one.

Nebraska has covered every week
this season, and although I’m probably
jinxing them, I’d take ‘em this week
too. -In case you’re still unsure, _

Strengthening
has improved  
Norris’ game

Norris, page 10

At the collegiate level, Norris was
pleased with her coach’s idea to bulk
up, admitting that college was a faster
game. Because of the strength condi-
tioning, her game improved.

“Strength made me a lot better
player. I like working out because there
is a translation from the weight room
onto court,” Norris said. “People jump
a lot higher and we are lot stronger.”

In her freshman and sophomore
years, Norris‘ strength readjustment
earned her Big East All-Rookie Team
honors freshman year and Second Team
All-Big East honors sophomore year.

Now a junior, she credits additional
personal improvements to two coaches,
Beerman and assistant coach Salima
Davidson, who helped her to become
better in every aspect of the game.

“Before when I was blocking I was
pretty much a non-factor at the net, my
blocking was one of my biggest
improvements since last year, that was
one of the things that Chris really
helped me with and I feel a lot

starters as well. Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and
Mark Mulder have set the course for the A’s
to be the best team since the All—Star break
——- even better than the Mariners. A

In the National League, the Braves took
a commanding 2-0 lead in their series
thanks to timely pitching from Tom Glavine
and lack of pitching from the Astros. The
Braves have a plethora of pitching, starting
with arguably the best pitcher of the decade
in Greg Maddux, followed by Glavine and
Kevin Millwood. The Braves’ newest
weapon, John Smoltz as their closer, is a
deadly factor in close games in the later
innings. Smoltz used to be a starter, so he

can most likely go three, maybe even four
innings if the Braves need him in extra
innings.

Now to the Diamondbacks. I’ve got
two names for every baseball fan: Curt
Shilling and Randy Johnson. With these two
pitchers throwing potentially four out of a
ﬁve ‘game series and four to ﬁve games out
of a seven game series, the Diamondbacks
have set themselves up for a title run.

Schilling demonstrated to the world on
Tuesday that his 10-year layoﬁ without
pitching in the playoffs was no cause for
concern as he pitched a shutout in a 1-0
Diamondback thrilling victory. A

Schilling will pitch again in game four
of the series if the Diamondbacks haven’t

won already, and with Johnson going yes-
terday in game two, he is scheduled to pitch
in game ﬁve if necessary.

I ‘don’t care who is in the
Diamondbacks’ bullpen or who the other
Arizona starters are. When you have two of
me top ﬁve pitchers in the National League
pitching for your team, the World Series
isn’t a goal; it is a promise.

The St. Louis Cardinals are the unfortu-
nate teamthat has to play Arizona in the
divisional series. The Cardinals have lots of
pitching talent in Matt Monis and Woody
Williams and great hitting with rookie sen-
sation Albert Pujols. Yet for some odd rea-
son, these talented _ young players don’t
sound right when they are put next to

Johnson and Schilling.

This year has been an exciting year for
home runs and batting in general, but the
pitching is going to get the Yankees and the
Diamondbacks into the World Series.

The pitching rnatchups will be intrigu-
ing with probable garne one starters being
Clemens and Schilling, and then game two
starters being Johnson against Pettitte. I see

a clear advantage to Arizona with Schilling‘

and Johnson pitching.
Clemens’ ERA wasn’t near what

‘Schilling’s was this year, and Schilling did-

n’t get the rim support of Clemens. For that
reason, Schilling will win games one and
probably four as well. ’ ~

Johnson will have a tougher challenge
because he is more prone to giving up mul-
tiple runs and fast via the home run. But
Pettitte has been injured this year and I think
if Johnson can get to the Classic then he’ll
be his dominant self. ’

The Yankees’ best chance for wins will
come when the Diamondbacks have to put
their third starter against the underrated
Mussina. Mussina probably should be the

No. two Yankee starter, but is in position to.

pick up key wins for his team by going
against third starters. V

In the end, though, Arizona will end the
Yankees’ glorious run and win the World
Series in six games. Johnson and Schilling
will sparkle over New York pitching and
both pitchers will earn the ﬁrst ring of their
careers. ’

News and prays to God that the Yankees

stronger,” Norris said.

She also attributes this season’s
development at-Zthe setting position to
Davidson, who was an All-American
setter at Penn State. Before this year,
Norris did not have an actual setting
coach. Like a quarterback" coach to a
quarterback, Davidson instructed Norris.

’ for one week, acquainting her to the art

of setting. Immediately Norris wit-
nessed a difference in her game.

A 20-year-old business major,
Norris grew up in Fostoria, a small town
in Ohio, where she was ibom as the
median between an older and younger
sister, all blessed with a gift for volley-
ball as well as an unyielding relish to
win. ‘

 NATIONAL COMING
“-11.0, 0171: DAYca5"   s?‘

This week is a celebration for Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender (GLBT) communities all
across the nation. During this week, not only do we celebrate who we are as apeople, but we also try to
raise awareness to our causes and help facilitate a better understanding of our lifestyle among the het- ’
erosexual community at large. Many members of the GLBT community do not feel safeenough in the
world to come out and even some members have a hard time dealing with issues of their own sexuality.

For those people who are having a hard time dealing with their own sexuality and wish to seek i
help and support the University of Pittsburgh Counseling Center offers a GLBT support group. The
group is held every Thursday from 3:30 to 5PM in 334 William Pitt Union. This group is conﬁdential, ‘
safe, has a drop-in format, no registration is necessary, and is open to all Pitt students. If you’d like
more information contactthe Counseling Center at 648-7 930.   s S

For any memberof the GLBT community and those that are Straight Supportive, Rainbow Alli-
ance invites you to attend our meetings. As a group we afrrangesocial events and outings, we inform
our member of political events and happenings that affect the GLBT community, and we help foster a ‘
better understanding between the GLBT community onhcampus and the campus body at large by orga-
nizing events such as Coming Out Week, Day of Silence, World Aids Week, and our Panel Program. In
our office we have pamphlets dealing with a wide range of issues, we also have an ever growing library
of books and movies that member are free to borrow at anytime, and most importantly you can always
