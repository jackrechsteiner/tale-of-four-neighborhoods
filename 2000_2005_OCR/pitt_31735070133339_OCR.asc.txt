Delivery  
man robbed

at gunpoint  

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

, -An Oakland pizza delivery man
was robbed at gunpoint Monday night,
according to officials in the city’s rob-

bery squad.
The holdup occurred at about 7:50‘
p.m. on Buffalo Street —- a small

stretch of mostly vacant houses behind

UPMC Presbyterian. According to’ a
city police report, two robbers escaped
with $72.65., ' A

Jason Pastrick, a 40-year-old
Mount Lebanon, Pa., resident, said he
was working Monday at University
Pizza, located between Fifth and
Forbes avenues ’ near Meyran Street,
when a man saying he lives at 9 Buffalo
St. called the pizza shop to place a
delivery order. Pastrick drove the pizza
to the address provided, where he
found two men sitting on the building’s
front porch. » .

But when Pastrick stepped out of
his car, he didn’t yet realize that the
house was vacant. It, like most of the

‘houses on the street, is owned by -

Presbyterian University Health
Systems Inc. and is not currently inhab-
ited. Pastrick said he -approached the
men, who waited a moment while
someone walked by the house, and that
one of the men then pulled out a pistol

, and demanded money.

Pastrick said the man_ told him,
“Give it up,” as he pointeda 38—caliber
revolver at Pastrick, who then threw a
roll of money onto the ground and
turned around to get back in his car.

, Pastrick said he backed down the
street and turned onto Terrace Street,
where he followed the robbers — who I

. were on foot — brieﬂy before losing

sight of them. According to Pastrick, he
then drove back to University Pizza,
where he reported the robbery.

Pastrick said the responding offi-

cers located a man who matched parts
of the description he provided, but that
he wasn’t either of the robbers.

Preaching the gospel

I _ 7  .\l\."AAi.oFI=/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR
Traveling evangelist draws a crowd outside Union

Traveling evangelist Matt Bourgault preaches on the comer of Forbes Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard yesterday as part of his three-day visit to Pitt’s campus. .

Bourgault drew a crowd of about 200 people and Pitt police officers asked him
to move away from the campus near the panther statue and onto city property on
Forbes Avenue near the Pitt Stop. '

Bourgault’s screamed sermon, peppered with Biblical citations and references
to the sins of college students, drew a large crowd of mostly jeering students.

“The devil — Satan —— walks these streets,” Bourgault said, referencing what
he called “the sins of Pittsburgh students” as drinking, abortion, smoking marijua-
na and fornication. .

Bourgault, who works with Consuming Fire Campus Ministries based in
Kinard, Fla., said he is drawn to speak to students because “most students are
searching for answers.” He said he hopes that his speeches will inspire students to
become missionaries and preachers. V

Students responded to his yelling with some of their own,

“How do you know the Bible is true?” came shouts from the, crowd.

“Who said you’re right?” ‘

“Why don’t you open up your mind a little?” ,

I Junior Allison Green (pictured next to Bourgault) questioned Bourgault about
his attitude toward gays and lesbians. I

“I don’t hate homosexuals,” he said. “I love their souls, but the Bible says their
actions are sins.”

Green said she had fun questioning Bourgault’s logic.

“Apparently I’m a sinner because I’m a lesbian,” she said. “I’m going to hell,
and if I don’t believe in hell, I’m still going.”

Henry Rollins, ‘80s
rocker, ‘examines
popular culture

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
The Pitt News

Henry Rollins said he knows’
exactly what his take on American cul-
ture makes him.

“I am a mean, bitter, cynical ass-
hole because I will not watch any
movies with Julia Robertstin [them].”

Rollins, an ‘80s pop culture icon
and former lead singer of the Rollins
Band, Verbalized his take on American
culture, Monday night to a sold-out
lecture at Carnegie Mellon University.

The event, scheduled to begin at
8:30 p.m., was slow to start as many
students arrived late and organizers
rushed around-attempting to make sure
they had enough space to accommo-

date a crowd speckled with multicol-

ored mohawks.

By 9:30 p.m., Rollins stepped
onstage. A standing ovation, shrieks
and cheers welcomed his presence-
Rollins told fans that he had come to
the city a few years ago, and they gave
him a free mug, so he felt compelled
to come back.

Rollins pleaded with his audience
to pursue knowledge or risk becoming
a “mediocre American who says,
‘Wow, ‘Ally McBeal’ is really good.»”’

Knowledge, he said, is acquired

not through asking questions but

through pursuing answers. “I wanna
know, and so I’m going to go and go,
until I keel over.”

Rollins told his audience he feels

one of the biggest tragedies surround- -
ing the events of Sept. 11 is that trav-
eling will become more difficult. He

described his -many travel experiences
to his audience. His stories included
Canadian bashing, a story about a man
and a toilet seat, and even a confession
about a very embarrassing attempt to
pick up a hotel clerk in Switzerland.
In his explanations of American

culture, Rollins ‘described the differ-
ence between men and women. “Men
are digital and women are analog,” he
said.

Men simply compute numbers and
hard information, he I said, while
woman take into consideration situa-
tions, personalities and, above all,
feelings. Feelings are the reason men
and women cannot communicate,

_ Rollins said, adding that ‘he believes
‘women and their feelings create the

chaos in the world of men.

Women’s feelings have forced
men to build Home Depots, Rollins
said. The fact that you don’t have to
walk very far to stumble upon a Home
Depot is so that men have a place to go

where order exists within the chaos."

To Rollins there is a simplehonesty in
the bubble of a leveling tool. ‘
g“To know what is-ﬂat and what is
not ﬂat, that tells the honest truth.”
Home Depot, Starbucks, Staples
and Office Max also serve another
purpose, according to Rollins. In
Canada, there exists a plethora of
American outlets. Americans put them
there so that when “America needs a
little more room, we’re all going to
take one step north.” He said that’s the

, reason they call it North America.

“It’s not always the hippest thing
to be an American,” Rollins said,
adding that Americans need to work to
change that. Rollins said the way to
make that change is to work toward
becoming cultured, intelligent adults.

‘ “I don’t understand why people
will settle for mediocre — so little
life‘, information and experience,” he
said.

Rollins said he has a few regrets,

and singled one of the greatest of '

those out for the audience.

“I go into bookstores and freak out
‘cause I’m not going to be able to read
it all,” he said. 

Robbery investigation continues

black men in their late teens or early
20s, based on descriptions provided by
Pastrick. The ﬁrst, standing at about 6
feet 2 inches, was wearing khaki pants
and an orange Alarex leather jacket,
which Pastrick said had the letter “A”
emblazoned on the left side. According

to Pastrick, that man _held the gun and
demanded the money.

A second man, about 5 feet 9. inch-
es tall and 150 pounds, stood‘ behind the
first, sporting a black Starter jacket with
a Pirates emblem on the front. .

The University Senate Council
unanimously passed a resolution to
indemnify faculty accused and
exonerated of research misconduct
at its meeting Monday.

Herbert Necdleman, chair of the ‘

Tenure and Academic Freedom
Committee, presented the resolu-

'tion, which was passed by the

Faculty Assembly last week.
Indemnification is‘ the reim-
burscmcnt of legal counsel fees to
the accused if they are found inno-
cent. '
I Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
supported the recommendation but
made it clear that reimbursement
would be limited to research mis-
conduct proceedings and would not
include other areas of legal pro-
ceedings within the University.
’ Board member Jim Mahcr said
the final version of the resolution
should be worded very carefully.
“The policy needs to be worded

- so that other internal affairs of -the

University are not interrupted,” he
said, referring to University‘disci-
plinary policy already in place.
The new resolution will not
affect cases of research impropriety
that do not escalate to the level of
misconduct. In these cases, the

committee on indemnification will.

decide whether indemnification
should be awarded.‘

 

Iteatl the exclusive stow online at ,

University Senate passes
indemniﬁcation resolution

Another resolution brought
before the board concerned the
University’s research integrity poli-
cy, which recommends that hear-
ings on allegations of research mis-
conduct be open at the request of

the accused. The board tabled this

resolution for further discussion at
theincxt meeting, scheduled for
Dec. 3. ‘

As the policy stands now, hear-
ings for those accused of miscon-
duct are closed and they are only
open to the general public if both
the accused and accusers agree.

- Ncedleman said this is highly
unlikely. _ -

He submitted a critique of the
policy and asked that the rights of
the accuser be reconsidered.

- _ Nordenberg said the policy was
positioned to move forward from
the last meeting without ‘change
because there are limitations in fed-
cral regulations of opening hearings
to the public.

The Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committcc’s argument,
according to Nccdlcman, is that the
University has to provide for confi-
dentiality unless both parties waive
that right. ’

“I think we need to debate this
because it is a fundamental issue,”
Ncedlcman said.

“I think we should study this
because there are issues on both

sides of your argument,” Mahcr

said.

PERSPECTIVES

EDITORIAL

An exercise in freedom of speech

Do you realize that most of us are
going to hell?

At least tl1at’s what an evangelist from
Consuming Fire Campus Ministries told a
large group of Pitt students and others who
passed by the comer of Forbes Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard yesterday after-
noon.

For some time, the man ranted and
raved about how college students are hell-
bound sinners who fornicate, drink, use
drugs and subject themselves to a whole
host of other “evils.”

Many from the large crowd that gath-
ered around him booed him, yelled for
him to leave campus and, in an ironic
twist, told him to go to the same place he
believed most of us are going.

And yet, he was a perfect representa-
tion of one of our country’s core values:
freedom of speech.

As annoying as this man was, he has
the right to stand there and talk. Even
though his view is a minority one, police
did not cart him off to jail.

Pitt police did remove him from

1 University property because he was

blocking the ﬂow of people in front of the
panther statue, but once on city property,
he had the right to spout off whatever he
wanted — within-the reasonable limits the
Supreme Court has set on freedom of
speech, of course. , -
But he was not the only person yes-
terday who exercised freedom of speech:

;So did all of those who came out to watch
him. By not simply walking away, they
expressed their freedom to stay and listen.
Those who shouted back also took advan-
tage of their freedom of speech. And even
those who just passed by without paying
him any heed made a statement in their
own way.

People didn’t even have to speak with
their mouths. We also have ﬁngers, which

It’s a timeto be thankful

Ifyou’re feeling as exhausted as every-
one else I know, you’re no doubt looking
forward to Thanksgiving break for a few
days of relaxation, sleep and home—cooked
meals. But let’s not forget what this holiday
is all about: turkey, stuffing and spending
time with armoying distant relatives — and
something about pilgrims and being tl1ank—
ful. So here’s a quick rundown of some_
' gs for which Pitt students can be thank’-
ful: -

- Coffee: Whether it’s Starbucks, Kiva
Han or 7-Eleven, coffee is the lifeblood of
most college students. It’s essential for gear-
ing up for a long night of studying or for
attempting to wake up Monday morning
after a long and exhausting weekend.

- Dave & Andy’s: Far and away the
best ice cream anywhere. The sugary, but-
tery smell as you walk in the door is almost
enough by itself to satisfy your sweet tooth.
There are few things as soothing to a thor-

- The Cathedral: We
may not have many trees or
even a campus in the tradi-
tional sense of the word, but
we do have the Cathedral of
Learning, an intimidating

nearly anywhere in the city.
From the 36th ﬂoor of ~ the
Cathedral, even the grimiest‘
parts of the city look beauti-
ful.

for a large cheese pizza, you
_ 1 can’t go wrong. I spent many a
night last year chowing down
on slices of Antoon’s with the
girls in my hall after a night at
the frats drinking cheap beer
and dancing with guys as
greasy as the pizza.

- Towers: They may .
indeed be cramped, pie-shaped and foul-

' smelling, but they are an integral part of the

classic Pitt freshman experience. If you’re
living in Towers now, enjoy the crazy,
social .atInosphere. And if you’re living any-
where else, either on- or off-campus, you’re
no doubt grateful for the extra room and
quiet you have now compared to when you
were a freshman. I

- Lower gas prices: For those of you
with cars, lower gas prices means you will
no longer have to choose between driving
to buy groceries and having money to actu-
ally buy the groceries when you get there.
Even in Oakland, where everything from
shampoo to apples is more expensive, gas is
going for $1.09 or so a gallon, thejowest
price in years. And even if you don’t have a
car, lower fuel prices might encourage your
landlord to crank the heat up above a brisk

65 degrees.

signs on Bigelow Boulevard: Although it’s
long been common practice for Pitt students
to boldly push through rush hour traﬂic on
Bigelow, the new neon signs give us bona

ﬁde permission to do so. Now if drivers 

look ” annoyed that you’re blocking their
SUVs as you walk to the Cathedral, you can

-. just point to the sign and tell them to wait.

0 Longer winter break: Although our
three-week "winter break may not be nearly

as long as at most otheruniversities, it’s an ,

improvement compared to last year. For all
of you who are feeling completely wom-
out by t_-his point in the semester, keep in
mind that there are a short three weeks
between Thanksgiving and the start of win-
ter break. That in itself is worth being
thankful for. .. ,

In an effort to regain

in the coming brutal winter,
I can’t help wondering if there isn’t
a better way. -

The United States may bring
this conﬂict to a respectable end by
motivating the moderate Islamic
leaders to take action. At present,
these men are watching from the
sidelines with their hands in their
pockets, rocking on their heels and
whistling.

It’s true that the United States is.

anything but popular in the Middle
East, but we do have several sympa-
thetic — although shaky — allies.
Among these are the governments
of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

These regimes were quick to
publicly denounce the attacks on
the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, but they have yet to take
an active role in bringing the terror-
ists to justice. '

. The war in Afghanistan could be
quickly resolved if our “allies” in
the Muslim world would commit to
helping in the hunt. ’

If Islamic nations followed up
on their words and pushed for the
capture of Osama bin Laden and
other known terrorists by providing
troops and freezing terrorist assets,
the situation would suddenly get
much less messy.

Since it has been reiterated
many times that the extremist views
and actions. of terrorist organiza-
tions do not ‘represent the views of
most Islamic governments, it seems
appropriate that those governments
would come crashing down on ter-
rorism and condemn it for what it is
— a terrible perversion of Muslim
ideals. '

Unfortunately, it is doubtful that
this righteous backlash will come
from any Middle Eastern nation.

The rulers of these regimes are
afraid of not only the terrorist orga-
nizations but of their own people.
No one understands this concern
better than Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf. -

Though many Muslim world
leaders were quick to express their

regret about the terrorist attacks,

Musharraf is the only one who has

States to suspend the bombing dur-
ing the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan. This feeble request does
little to cast a favorable light on- the
Pakistani ruler and will almost cer-
tainly go completely unheeded by
the American government.
Musharraf is currently feeling the
pain of his unforgivable sin — he is
a Muslim president in league with
the country that many of his people
perceive as the enemy.

Under the circumstances, it will
be very difficult to create a healthy
Muslim worl consensus in favor of

any U.S. action.

As demonstrated in Pakistan, no
Islamic head of state can support
the United States without feeling
the sting of popular sentiment. But
if the regimes of the Muslim world
were true to their religion and the
common good of mankind, they
would cast the risk aside, roll up
their sleeves and join America in its
crusade against terror.

pages? But when I ask myself why I always
wanted to be older than I was, I’m not quite
sure. It just seemed like the people a few

years older than me really had it all togeth- .

er.
‘ I remember when I was in the fourth
grade and the eighth—graders seemed so
much bigger than me — so grown up with
their big earrings and makeup. Once I got to

high school I watched the seniors smoke '

cigarettes on the lawn and listened to them
talk about getting new cars and choosing

colleges. Even now people tell me about

taking the GRE, and I wonder if I’ll ever be
old enough to think about an MFA.

That year always rolls around, though.
I never thought I’d be old enough to see an
R—rated movie without sneaking in, get into
a club on /under-21 night, buy my own cig-
arettes and Vote. Now I can do all those
things, and in reality, I didn’t have to wait
too long to do them. And my life isn’t any
more together at (almost) 19 than it was at
9. ‘ . '

I This is all so easy to say in retrospect.‘

Anne can tell her little sister that smoking
pot at'14 doesn’t make life any easier or
adulthood come any faster, but that doesn’t
mean she’l1 take Anne’s advice. After all,
we’ve got high—speed Internet access,
Instant Messenger, scarmers and color
printers for fake IDs, and rich white kids
with plenty of money to pay for this week’s
cool drug. The world is faster now than it

‘ was when I started high school ﬁve years

ago. Everybody’s got a cell phone and a
hook-up.Everybody’s a grown-up.

I probably would have thought Arme’s ’

sister was cool when I was 14. After all,
how many other high school freshmen get

' invited to all the seniors’ parties and call 21-

year-olds their best ﬁiends? Being a nerd, I
was envious of the badasses I crossed paths
with. Now I just wonder if she’1l ﬁnish her
freshman year without getting’ busted, with-
out losing her virginity. . .without forgetting
most of the year itself. - .

-~ We can’t protect our sisters from high
school’s rites of passage. We can’t send
them a D.A.R.E. T—shirt and expect themto
“justsay no.” And it’s hypocritical of us to
want to do this, no matter how much we
want to protect them. How many of us have

gotten busted for drinking in high school by‘

our parents or worse? How many of us
have seen our names in the police blotter?
The bestlcan do is tel1Anne totalkto
her sister honestly and pass on what she
knows that her sister, at 14, probably does-
n’t. Anne can tell her to be safe and to
always have a friend around in case some-
thing happens. She can make her promise
to tell Anne if there’s a problem.

Meanwhile, I’ll cross my ﬁngers that her -

sister will make the right decision when it
matters. ‘

THE BEST PIA CE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Pitt upsets two ig as fs

NATALIE KRASMAN
Staff Writer

Pitt’s volleyball team did not have

a chance at making the Big East-

Tournament, but the women were not
going to give up. An undiscouraged
Panthers team united to destroy two of
their conference rivals last weekend.

The Panthers played both matches
on the road and defeated Rutgers, the
No. 2 seat in the Big East, Friday 3-1
and pummeled Villanova Sunday in a
3-0 sweep.

Sophomore Wendy Hatlestad and
freshman Gini Ullery, who both
received conference honors after last
weekend’s victories, were key charac-
ters in Pitt’s fairy tale weekend.

Hatlestad, the 6-foot-3-inch out-
side hitter, and Notre Dame’s Kristen
Kinder both received the Big East Co-
Player of the Week award, while out-
side hitter Ullery was dubbed Rookie
of the Week.

“Wendy carried us all year and it is
great to see her be awarded for her per-
formance,” head coach Chris Beerman
said. “Gini has really turned the comer

great future ahead of her.”

In the week, Hatlestad recorded50
kills on 109 attacks, hitting .303 while
Ullery posted 25 kills on 72 attacks
and 27 digs.

This season, Hatlestad‘ leads the
Big East in kills, registering 498 over-
all and averaging 5.08 per game. She is
also ranked second in Big East match-
es with 26 service aces. And against
Rutgers, she shattered a 2000 Pitt
record set by Marcia Thiesen, whose .
27 kills in four games will now be
replaced with Hatlestad’s 34 kills.

The Panthers (10-15 overall, 7-5
Big East) won five out of their last six
matches against conference opponents,
satisfying one of their 2001 goals — to
ﬁnish with a winning record in the Big
East.

Wrestling opens season against No. 8 Lehigh  

KEVIN NASH
Staff Writer

No. 15-ranked Pitt wrestling starts its season
tonight at No. 8-ranked Lehigh. Seniors Shawn
Amistade, Blaise Mucci, David Sandberg and
Dan Stine will lead the team this season. -

“You win or lose with your seniors,” said
head -coach Rande Stottlemyer. “If these guys
have outstanding years, we will be very good. If
we lose one of them, it will kill us.”

These four seniors are all NCAA qualifiers
with Stine leading the pack as a three-time qual-
ifier at 184 pounds. Mucci (141 pounds) is a
two-time qualifier, and Amistade (133 pounds)
and Sandberg (197 pounds) each have qualified
once.

Stottlemyer, who is now in his 23rd season
as head coach at Pitt, sees Lehigh, Lock Haven,
Cleveland State, West. Virginia and Edinboro as
the programs that w-ill present the greatest chal-
lenges, but feels that his team is in the hunt.

“We are optimistic. We have seven NCAA
qualifiers — one [Justin Giovinco] is injured
who we are not sure about,” Stottlemyer said.

Junior Carl Fronhofer is ranked eighth in the
nation, wrestling at 165 pounds. Fronhofer went

25-7 last season and won the Eastern Wrestling
League championship in addition to qualifying
for the NCAAS for the. second year in a row.
Giovinco, who is questionable for the sea-
son, saw most of his action last season in tour-
naments inwhich he posted a 14-2 record.

_ Giovinco, who wrestles at 149 pounds, finished

with an overall record of 15-5 last season.
The Panthers feature five wrestlers that are

ranked in the top 20. In addition to Fronhofer,

Sandberg is ranked 11th, sophomore Zach Doll
and Stine are both ranked 14th,,and Amistade is
ranked 17th. '

Stottlemyer also said the team will receive
contributions from some freshmen. Mike May,
Ric"h Boden and Jim Mangan make up the fresh-
men on the main squad. -  ‘ ‘

May, who is out of Derry Area High School,
will compete at 125 pounds. Mangan or Boden
will wrestle at 149 pounds and "Doll or Donald

Rush will compete at 157 pounds. Rob Black or_

Matt Cutullo will wrestle 174 pounds.

Doll had one of the better tournament
records at 8-1 and led Pitt with two technical
falls and six pins ‘last season.

Stottlemyer said Fronhofer’s match against
Lehigh’s All-American No. 4-ranked Chris

Vitale is the premiere matchup tonight.
Fronhofer and Vitale faced off twice last season
and split the series.

Fronhofer had the team’s best dual meet
record last season at 8-0 and finished the season
with an overall record of 17-4.

Stine had the Panthers’ best overall record '

last season at 17-3. I
Stine will wrestle No. 10-ranked Rob Rohn

and Sandberg will face No.5 3—ranked John '

Trenge. , ‘
Jacob Lininger is the Panthers’ only heavy-

weight. Lininger posted one of the better?-records ,
I in tournament competition at 11-4 last season.

_ Last season the Panthers finished with a 5-6
record and tied for 25th place at the NCAA
Championships. They also placed second at the
Mat ’ Town Invitational and third at’ EWL
Championships.

“We are not sure how good we can be,”
Stottlemyer said about his outlook on this sea-

.Pitt’s

Serve up turkey, stuffing and a Backyard Brawl

I don’t know about anyone else,
but I’m wishing that it were
Thanksgiving already.

Not only do we have
time off from class and
get to travel home, but we
also have the chance to
stuff ourselves full of
food while watching foot-
ball. And of course, the
football doesn’t end on
Turkey Day. In fact, the
games I look forwardto
the most are the ones
played after the holiday.

This year’s Backyard
Brawl will make or break

 

Spots VI:

Karen Bielak » .

Now that the Panthers are in the;

race, they are not about to let any-
one get in their way —— especially
. not West Virginia.

The Panthers proved
that they are a quality
team with an upset vic-
tory against then-No. 12
Virginia ‘Tech. Pitt dom-
inated on both offense
and defense and played
like the team that many
were optimistic about in
the preseason.

But college football
fans everywhere were
quick to downplay this

season. The

Panthers are 4-5 overall and 3-3 in
the Big East entering the matchup
and need to win their remaining two

“games in order to be eligible for a

bowl. 2 1
Despite the fact that the
Mountaineers are just 3-6 overall
and 1-4 in the conference, a number
of people believe they will top the
Panthers.

I’m not convinced by that line
of thinking, because Pitt is a team
that began the season 1-5 and left
fans to wonderif it could win
another game. ‘

_ -2

victory because
Syracuse beat the Hokies the previ-
ous week.- That is ridiculous
because. no matter what the score
was against the Orangemen, Pitt
still beat Virginia Tech and that has
to count for something. It provided

a huge boost for the team and had-

fans whispering, for the first time
since the loss to South Florida, the
words “bowl game.”_ ' 5 ‘ '

The Panthers then went on to
crush Rutgers, and although the
final score was just 42-0, itcould
have very wellbeen 84-0 if Walt
Harris wasn’t a nice guy.

Again, Pitt was incomplete
control the entire game, and it
seemed as though nothing could go

P wrong.

Receivers were left wide open
and even when they were covered,
they still made the catches. There
were holes all over, the field to run,
and even David Priestley ran into
the end zone for his second touch-
down of the year. ‘

Who would’ve thought he’-d run
for one touchdown in a season, let
alone two?

The defense also excelled
although it was not the most daunt-
ing task they’ve been faced with
this season. Scarlet Knights’ quar-
terback Ryan Cubit had trouble
completing passes all afternoon,
throwing more errant balls to the
sideline than to the players actually
on the field. ‘ I

But no matter who the oppo-
nent, a win is a win “ and the
Panthers steamrolled through this
one. .
On the other hand, I am greatly

-unimpressed with West Virginia.

The team’s only wins came against
Ohio, Kent State and Rutgers, none
of which equal the caliber of
Virginia Tech.

Granted,

nessing the play of the Scarlet

a high school team could win by

that score.

West Virginia takes on Temple

ly have another victory. '

I10 matter

what the

highly doubt they can prepare for
what the Panthers are going to hit

them with.

This is a team that believes in
itself and has every reason to. The
turnaround this season has been

amazing, and no matter what hap-
pens for the remainder of the sea-' :

Green, who has rushed for more

you missed a good game.

With 10 seconds to play and no
timeouts left, the Titans were down
16-10 and inside the Ravens’ 10-

McNair dropped back and hit wide
receiver Kevin Dyson, who just like
in the 2000 Super Bowl, was
stopped at the l—yard line.

Tennessee ‘could not stop the

clock and needed to run one more
play. Titans center Bruce Matthews
grabbed the ball from an official,
before he spotted it, put it down and
snapped it to McN air who dove into
the end zone for an apparent win-
ning score.

But the Ravens were caugh.t off-
sides while trying to get back to
their side of the field, and the
Titans didnot have a legal forma-
tion, only. having six of the manda-
tory seven men on th_e line of scrim-
mage.

This caused the referees to
throw ﬂags and created mass confu-
sion that took nearly 10 minutes to
figure out.

'EVentually, after several offi-
cials’ conferences _ and after talking
with both coaching staffs,“ the offi-
cials decided that once the Raven
defender hit the Titans’ offensive
linemen, the play is blown dead and
a penalty is called. Thus, the Titans
had the ball for one last un—timed
down, with a chance to score.

Gators will defeat Florida State at the Swamp

Compulsive, page 12

Cal is really bad and Stanford is really good.

Cal stumbles into the 104th meeting with a 0-9
record, while the Cardinals are 6-2 and still have
hope for a PAC-10 title. .

Stanford has one of the most balanced offenses
in the nation —- it averages 202 yards per game on
the ground and 243 in the air.

Chris Lewis will start his third game in a row.
He was 13 of 23 for 169 yards, three touchdowns
and no interceptions in a 51-37 win over Arizona.
Running back Brian Allen had 143 yards in the
game and has scored seven touchdowns this season.

Heading against the Stanford offense is a Cal
defense that ranks second to last in Division I-A
football in scoring defense, and it allows 43 point
per game. And what leads to blowouts? Turnovers.
Cal has a minus-18 turnover margin. Ouch.

The defense has given up. more than 50 points
three times and given up more than 40 points three
other times. -

Cal’s offense isn’t too much of a threat either.
Quarterback Kyle Boller hasn’t completed more
than 10 passes in his last two games against
Arizona and USC. .

No running back has scored more than two
touchdowns this season for Cal.

Cal loses by an average of 25.9 points per
game, which works for me.

West Virginia came off of a very tough 24-13
loss at Syracuse last weekend, a game that could
have been salvaged without turnovers.

Avon Coboume kept his game tight as he ran

snaps last week and didn’t take good care of the
ball as he handed the ‘Cuse the ball deep in the

West Virginia’s defense is for real. It beat up on

the turnovers and Syracuse’s great field position. I

Owls bring an 0-4 road record to Morgantown and
a four game losing streak, most recently losing to
Virginia Tech, 35-0. —

Freshman quarterback Mike McGann has been
battered all season long and he just doesn’t have
much talent surrounding him. When coach Bobby
Wallace has seen hisyoung signal-caller get beat
up enough, he sends backup Mac Devito in, who
doesn’t do any better.

WVU has crushed all of the opponents that it

. was expected to this season, including an 80-7 win

over Rutgers two weeks ago. Give the

Mountaineers one more win before Pittv kicks their ’

asses.
West Virginia 31, Temple 10

Florida State at Florida (-15) V
Every game that critics thought Florida might
have some trouble with this season has turned out

to be a disaster for the opposition.

Florida won 44-15 at LSU, beat then-No. 22
Mississippi State 52-0 and destroyed South
Carolina last week 54-17 at South Carolina. The
Gators have won by an average of 33.9 points with
417 passing yards per game.

Rex Grossman is the catalyst for the offense.
Last week he completed 21 of 33 passes for 302
yards and three touchdowns. Grossman threw to
nine different receivers last week.

Sickeningly enough, the 302 yards passing was
his lowest output of the year. He has throwm 30
touchdown passes to 10 interceptions. The Gators
are 5-0 at the Swamp. .

Although Florida State is a decent team, I ju
think they’re too young to handle the Gators and
the Swamp crowd, let alone the fact that its defense
has ‘struggled this season.

Freshman quarterback Chris Rix is good but he
hasn’t played in a Florida-Florida State gameyet,
and it can be an overwhelming environment.

Rix has struggled a bit on the road and although
he has thrown for 21 touchdowns and three straight
300-yard games, I don’t see him breaking down a
good Florida defense. ‘ ~

Florida State’s defense is allowing 374 yards ‘

per game, the most for a Florida State team since
1984, and the team lost last week to North Carolina
State at home. It was the first home loss for Florida
State since it joined the ACC.

I see Florida State dropping out of the top 25 in
the near future.
