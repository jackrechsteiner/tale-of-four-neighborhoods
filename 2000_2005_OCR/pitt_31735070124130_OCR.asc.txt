 embers of the Uni-
1 versity community
 . .  placed 3,041 ﬂags on
the Cathedral of Learning lawn
yesterday morning, each bearing
the name and age of a victim
of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks, as well'as the ﬂight
number on which (or the location
at which) that person died.
Three of the ﬂags were
adorned in blue and gold, honor-
ing Pitt alumni killed in the
attacks: Kevin Marlo, Margaret
Quinn Orloske and Ludwigjohn
Picarro.
“Today, across this great land
—- and, irideed, throughout the
world —'people are pausing to
remember the terrible devasta-
tion that struck America one

year ago,” Chancellor Mark-
A. Nordenberg said during,
yesterday’s “Flags for Heroes” :

ceremony, part of Pitt’s day-long
remembrance of 9/11/01. '
“Today, we gather to honor
those innocent victims who
died as targets of the attacks,”
Nordenberg told the crowd,

 

estimated at more than 2,000.
“We gatherto honor those
heroes who died in valiant rescue
missions. We gather to honor
those who died in the plane

that crashedvhere in western‘

Pennsylvania because citizen
passengers made the ultimate
sacriﬁce of their own lives to
prevent further devastation.
“Today, we also extend expres-
sions of our collective support
to those whose lives have been

forever changed through the’

loss of loved ones on Sept. 11,
2001.”

The chancellor commemo-
rated each of the Pitt alumni
killed in the attacks:

° Marlo was a 1995 graduate
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences (CAS) and was a member
of Delta Tau Delta. “He was an
associate director of equity sales
at Sandler O’Neill and also was
an aspiring actor,” Nordenberg
said. “His family and friends
remember that ‘he would do

' anything for people he loved.’”

0 Orloske earned a master’s

Prayerbook:

       

degree in library science here in
1974. “She was a vice president
with the insurance brokerage

ﬁrm of Marsh McLennan, with P
her office on the 96th ﬂoor of

the World Trade Center. She is
remembered by her family and
friends for her two greatest loves,
creating gardens and uniting
communities,” the chancellor
said. I -

’ ° Picarro received his bach-
elor’s degree, from CAS in 1979
and was a senior vice president
of the Zurich Insurance Com-
pany.

“On Sept. 11th, he was
attending a business meeting on
the 100th ﬂoor of the World
Trade Center,” Nordenberg said.
“Family an_d friends said he was
thrilled to be a part of the fast-
paced energy of the international
ﬁnancial district, but he never let
business interfere with attending
his sons’ sporting events.”

In remembrance of all 3,041
victims, the chancellor read a
passage from the Reformjudaism

   

“In the rising of te run  in its
going down, i ~
we remember them;

I In the blowing of the wind and in the

chill of winter,
WE remember them;

In the opening of the buds‘ and in the
warmth of summer; P
I/Ve remember them;

In the rustle: of leave: and beauty
of autumn,
We remember them;

In the beginning of the year and when
it ends,
I/Ve remember them;

When we are weary and in need of
strength, '
WE remember them;

I/Vhen we are lost and sick at heart,

I/Vhen we have joys we yearn to share,
I/Ve remember them;

So long as we live, they too shall live,
For they are now a part qfus. ”

about our losses, as devastating
as the were ” Nordenber said.
“It alslb is about our strength in
going forward, and our renewed
commitment to the spirit and
principleson which this nation
was founded.” ,

He quoted 1936 Republic
Party presidential nominee Wen-
dell Wilkie: “I believe in America
because in it we are free — free
to choose our govermnent, to
s eak our minds, to observe our
different religions. Because we
are generous with our freedom,

we share our rights with those’

who disagree with us.”

The chancellor also quoted
from author Vi/"illiam Faulkner’s
Nobel Prize acceptance speech,
delivered during the grimmest
days of the Cold War: “I decline
to accept the end of man.. ..I
believe that man will not merely
endure: he will be an inexhaust-
ible voice. ..because he has a soul,
a spirit capable of compassion
and sacriﬁce and endurance.”

  UNIVERSITY TIMES

staff & faculty

lthough faculty and staff
can take classes at a frac-
'on of the cost for tra-

ditional students, Pitt employees
still are feeling the sting of higher
prices this fall.

Due largely to escalating fees,
the cost for a staff or faculty
member taking a 3-credit class
at Pitt is almost 2 1/2 times what
it was ﬁve years ago.

Last month, the University
approved a 14 percent increase in
tuition for in—state residents. Pitt
also raised some of its required
student fees, three of which are
charged to employees who enroll
for classes here.

The computing and network
services fee for part-time students
was increased for the ﬁrst time
in ﬁve years, more than doubling
from $30 to $65 per term.

The security, safety and trans-
portation fee was raised by more
than a third this year, going
from $55 to $75 per term for all
students. The fee is almost ﬁve
times what it was in 1997-1998
($16 per term).

Two student fees were not
raised this year: the student
activity fee ($18 per term), which
all students must pay, and the
student health fee ($130 per
term), which is waived for part-
time students at the Pittsburgh
campus. The student activity

' fee has more than tripled in

ﬁve years, from $5 toi$18 per
term.

Some members of the Staff
Association Council (SAC) have
challenged the need for the
increase in fees —— indeed, the
need for some of the fees at
all.

Provost James Maher said
the senior administration is
considering a request from SAC
President Barbara Mowery that
the computing fee be waived for
staff members who take classes.
No decision has been made on
the request, Maher said.

Carol Hodgkiss of the N euro-
Learning Research Center, who,
co-chairs SAC’s benefits and
welfare committee, said, “Staff

are a different group from stu-
dents. Why not have different
rules?” Hodgkiss said she has
heard complaints about the fees
from fellow staff members who
take classes here.

One complainant, Amy
Hewitt, an audio—visual coordi-
nator, was hired at Pitt in 1999
after earning her undergradu-
ate degree here. “I understand
having student fees from when I
was an undergraduate,” Hewitt
said. “Students are eligible for
certain activities. For example, I
used to go the museums for free
with my student I.D. Now as
a staff member, I have to pay.
And yet I still pay the student
activity fee when I’m [enrolled]
in a class.”

Staff and faculty who take
classes do not receive student
I.D.s, which means they usually
are ineligible for special student
discounts and beneﬁts.

SAC member Jeanie Goff,
communications manager in
University Marketing Com-
munications, said she is galled
by the computing and network
services fee. “It doesn’t make
sense to me that I have the same
access to the computing labs as a
staff member as I do as a student,
and I have to pay for it when I
enroll in a class,” Goff said.

“I have an account which
gives me access to the computer
labs and a 900 sheet quota [per
termj for printing at the labs. It
is the same situation for a staff
member as a student. I now
have to pay $65 for the account
which I was given for free as
a staff employee. I don’t think
that’s fair.”

“VVhy not eliminate this fee
if we get the beneﬁt as staff
anyway?” queried Hodgkiss. She
noted that the student health
fee is waived for employee-
students because the University
offers health beneﬁts options to
employees.

In a written statement to
the University Times, Provost
Maher indicated there are other
considerations:

° “First, a very large majority
of the staff who are registered as
students collect the free software,
which is available to students
and available to other University
employees only for a fee;

° “Second, a signiﬁcant
number of staff students make
use of the public laboratories and
the printing facilities;

0 “Third, staff who have
access to a University computer
by virtue of their work do not
have that access ‘ automatically
for course work but must seek
their supervisors’ permission
to use their computers in that
way, and

0 “Finally, staff students
are already receiving a very
signiﬁcant scholarship, which
is not available to the other
students of the University.”

SAC’s Mowery said she was
frustrated last January while
lobbying against an increase
in the computing services fee
for employees taking classes. “I
didn’t have the information at
that time to say how many staff
take classes,” Mowery said.

Fee hikes drive up class costs for
who are students

She said the Board ofTrustees
student affairs committee recom-
mended increasing the fee from
$30 to $65 for all students,
including employees, partly
because they believed that only
a small number of employees
would be affected.

About 13 percent of Pitt’s
employees took at last one Uni-
versity course last year, according
to the Ofﬁce of Institutional
Research. Of Pitt’s approximately
10,500 total employees, 1,037
staff and 347 faculty members
used the educational beneﬁt
themselves in the last academic
year.

During the 2001-2002 aca-
demic year, ,2,091 employees
used educational benefits at
Pitt campuses for themselves,
spouses or dependent children,
or in combination, according to
Institutional Research.

Some 542 Pitt staff and 283
faculty used the beneﬁt to pro-
vide tuition remission for their
spouses and/or dependent chil-
dren (including some employ-
ees who also used beneﬁts for
themselves), according to Robert-
Goga, assistant director of Insti-
tutional Research.

Tuition charges for faculty
and staff depend on the employ-
ee’s date of hire. The University
“grandfathers” rates at $5 per
credit for those hired beforeJuly
1, '1 994.‘ ' For those‘ hired» after
that, tuition rates vary according
to whether the course is graduate
or undergraduate.

For example, a full—time staff
member hired afterJuly 1, 1994,
taking one 3-credit undergradu-
ate course would pay $24.39 in
tuition (3 percent of the $271
per-credit rate) and $158 in fees
for a total of$182.39.

Five years ago, the same
undergraduate course would
have cost a Pitt employee only
$7 5 .73 , according to Institutional
Research. A 3-credit course
in 1997-1998 cost $591; the
employee-student would have
paid 3 percent of that, or $17.73,
plus fees totaling $58.

Graduate courses cost more.
For a staff or faculty member
hired after July 1,1994, taking
one 3-credit Arts and Sciences
graduate course currently costs
$276.40. That breaks down to
$131.40 tuition (10 percent
of the $1,314, 3-credit rate)
plus $145 in fees (the same as
undergraduate fees, except that
the student activity fee is $5).

Five years ago, the ‘same
graduate course would have cost
the employee student $146.10,
a little more than half of what it
costs today. That breaks down to
10 percent of the $951, 3-credit
tuition rate, or $95.10, plus $51
in fees.

“It’s the fees, not the tuition
[costs] that hurts us,” said Hodg-
kiss.

SAC may focus its Oct. 28
assembly on I.D. and fee issues
for staff who take classes.

Goff said that an assembly
to address those issues is a good
idea. “But I hope it wouldn’t
end there, with just a discussion.
These fees really affect us.”

UNIVERSITY SENATE

 

IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

Three years ago a piece I wrote appeared
in this space (University Times, Sept. 30, I999)
devoted in large part to the way university faculty
were portrayed in several novels. In none were
faculty portrayed positively and to some extent
faculty were held up to ridicule.

Since then I have read a number of other
novels, including at least one by David Lodge,
that do not put faculty in a favorable light.
Several deal with the proclivity of faculty to

attend conferences in exotic locales, at the expense of others.
These conferences are often pictured as providing opportunities
for adultery, excessive alcohol consumption and illegal drug use,
and other undesirable activities.

On the other hand, I read almost every day in the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette about academic conferences at which papers are
presented on topics such as the application of new techniques of
scientiﬁc inquiry, the development of new treatments for the sick
and injured, and the recognition of social and economic factors
that inﬂuence the daily lives of many people.

_ VVhat accounts for the differences between the descriptions of
conferences in the novels and the press? Perhaps the newspaper
articles are written by reporters who are not privy to the sex,
alcohol and drug use, if any, that take place in conjunction with
the reported meetings. Or, perhaps such conduct is irrelevant
to the news story and thus not reported. Still another thought
is that the reporters will retain such material to use when they
attempt to write the great American novel.

Further interest of mine in conferences and meetings, beyond
the literary, was prompted by some casually obtained bits of
information. Recently I realized that a host of academic and"
other types of university administrators attend a great number of
meetings of organizations devoted to their particular spheres of
responsibility. For example, there is a least one meeting yearly
of associate or vice deans of public health schools. The most
recent was held in Banff this summer. Department chairpersons
in one-professional school (and it may be true for others) meet
with their counterparts at other universities twice yearly, once
nationally and once on a state basis. — s ~ .

Most readers are aware that university chancellors and
presidents meet. For example, Chancellor Nordenberg attends

 

the Big East Conference’, held inconjunction with vt'he‘"‘Big'East“
basketball championship tournament in New York in March.

Also, because Pitt is a member of the Association of American

Universities, he attends meetings of the chief executives of
institutions that belong to that organization.

There are also meetings of heads of academic health centers,
chief university academic ofﬁcers such as our provost, law school
cleans, and the list goes on. . 1

There also are many non-acadernic administrators, -~ such
as those involved with fund raising, alumni relations, student
health services, student affairs, human resources, government
relations, public safety, public affairs, facilities management,
as well as university personnel with titles such as treasurer,
controller, in-house legal counsel, registrar — all of whom have
associations that hold professional meetings. Some groups are
national organizations with regional and state chapters, all of
which hold yearly meetings. ’ '

The University apparently spends a considerableiamount
of money sending administrative personnel to meetings of
their professional or trade associations. But one position in the
university administrative and governance structure apparently
does not fall into any professional organization: To my knowledge
there is no association for elected leaders  universities. I
believe I would have beneﬁted greatly during my three years as
president of the University Senate if I had had the opportunity
to exchange information‘ and views with those holding similar
positions at other universities. It would have been useful to
learn how elected leaders at other institutions deal with matters
such as excessive institutional secrecy, ﬁnd ways to have their
initiatives taken seriously by administration, as well as how they
measured their effectiveness inuniversity affairs.

It would be beneﬁcial to institutions if their elected leaders
had an opportunity to exchange information and views. A
meeting of such leaders in the AAU institutions might prove
particularly desirable in dealing with issues common to most,
if not all, of its member institutions. I wonder whether this
lack of association opportunities for elected leaders represents
simply an oversight, or whether it is a reﬂection of top university
lea'dership’s view that facilitating elected leaders getting together
might stimulate activities contrary to the “best” interests of
the universities. _

Since I do not expect or desire to serve again as president
of the University Senate,‘ if such an association of elected
leaders were created I would not be able to beneﬁt by making
a trip to an exotic locale at university expense. Thus, I have no ~
personal stake in the matter. ’

I am interested in readers’ thoughts about the establishment
of an association of elected university leaders to facilitate the
sharing of information, ideas and experiences. I

SEPTEMBER 12,2002

Coverage of how Pitt reports
SAT averages labeled ‘unfair’

nfair was how Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg
described recent news
coverage that Pitt has misrepre-
sented student test scores. _

Nordenberg told Senate
Council yesterday that the Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette was “unfair
to a number of people who
do their work effectively and
ethically and do it honestly.”

In a Sept. 8 front page story
and a follow—up editorial Sept.
1 1, the Post-Gazetteirnplied that
Pitt was rnis—reporting average
SAT scores of its entering fresh-
men to put itself in a favorable
light. .
The Post—Gazette reported
that some schools, including
Pitt, exclude scores from certain

lower—performing groups such
as athletes, before calculating
their SAT average.

“This year, the practice meant
that Pitt excluded roughly one
in 10 freshmen, or 305 students,
and in years past it has meant
as many as 448 students were
excluded. By dropping them
from the tally, Pitt in‘ effect
inﬂates its SAT average.”

The editorial charged that
Pitt was releasing “apples [that]
can’t be compared to other
schools’ oranges.”

. Nordenberg responded that
Pitt has used the same SAT
reporting system for moretthan
30 years, dating back to the
origins of programs that allow
certain athletes an.d special

‘We remember them’

CONTINUED FROM PAGE I .

“The chancellor continued:
“Faulkner also said that it is
our duty ‘to help man endure
by lifting his heart [and] by
reminding him of the courage
and honor and hope and pride
and compassion and’ pity and
sacrifice which have been the
glory of his past.’”

“Today,” Nordenberg said,
“we might ‘begin by resolving
to nurture those qualities in
ourselves, to encourage those
qualities in others, and to rec-

9gnize..that those very :h1.1man..

qualities '— qualiﬁes well within
our reach — not only are the
glory of our past but are the
foundation of our future.”

category studentsto be admit-
ted using different admissions
criteria.

“The basis for that much
earlier decision and for our
continuing use of that convention
is straightforward,” Nordenberg
said. “Our admissions profes-
sionals believe that the great
bulk of our prospective students
are those who are not heavily
recruited athletes or do not fit
into any special access categories,
and who are most interested
in the standards they will need
to meet if they wish to be
admitted to. the University of
Pittsburgh.”

‘The chancellor added that
Pitt does not compare its SAT
scores with those of other institu-
tions. “Instead, the focus [of
scores] is on our University and
their message is intended to
be a useful one [to prospective
students]: Given the proﬁle of
our most recent class, if you
want to be admitted to the
University of Pittsburgh, here
are the credentials that you will
likely need to present.”

Further, the chancellor
pointed out, when the University
provides SAT data to publications
that evaluate higher education
institutions, it always follows the
particular instructions of those
publications, which vary.

He cited the Princeton
Review, which requests data
on the “entire freshman class
and then publishes the average
SAT score; U.S. News & World
Report, which takes submitted
SAT data on the entire entering

class but then reports the 25th
percentile score and the 75th
percentile score; and Baron’s
Proﬁles of American Colleges,
which directs schools speciﬁ-
cally not to include scores for
international students or for
enrollees in special preference
programs.

Nordenberg said, “The clear
theme of the Post—Gazette [Sept.
8] article is that there is only
one acceptable approach to such
reporting. VVhat is especially
interesting, then, is that there
is no standard convention for
reporting SAT scores even
among these publications.”

Nordenberg further noted
that the University’s general
reports of institutional progress
compare the rate of increase of
Pitt’s SAT scores from year to
year as opposed to either absolute
numbers or comparisons with
other schools’ scores.

The chancellor maintained
that if Pitt had changed its
reporting process and based
progress on the scores of all
freshmen, “Our rate of progress
over the last several years would
have been even more dramatic,
because the SAT“scores earned
by our students in our special
admission programs have been
rising even more quickly than
the general increase in the
student body, as dramatic as that
has been.” He did not provide
speciﬁcs.

“Ironically, because of the
national debate over the validity
of the SAT scores and more
personal reservations that I hold
 I have moved away in my
own reporting from using SAT
scores at.-all,” Nordenberg said,’
including in his 2001 and 2002
annual reports to the Board of
Trustees. “Over the last two
years, my reports made no

Not if you’re a phlegmatic
Semester at Sea veteran like
Frank Colavita, who faced an
analogous situation after being
named academic dean for next
su1nmer’s SAS voyage.

'The Institute for Shipboard
Education, which administers
SAS out ofofﬁces in the William
Pitt Union, announced recently
that after three summer voyages
to European and/or Mediter-
ranean ports, the summer 2003
voyage (and future summer
voyages) will visit the Paciﬁc
Rim.

Scheduled to depart Vancou-
ver, B.C., onjune 17, the 65-day
voyage will take students to Sitka,
Alaska; Vladivostok, Russia;
Pusan, Korea; Shanghai, China;
Haiphong, Vietnam; Keelung,
Taiwan, and Osaka, Japan,
returning to Seattle on Aug.
21.

“It’s an exciting curriculum
and it makes a lot of sense
from a practical point of view,”
said Colavita, a Pitt associate
professor of psychology.

“If there is one, overall motto
for Semester at Sea, it’s ‘Be
ﬂexible,” he pointed out. “That
applies ‘to this change in the
summer itinerary.”

Colavita, 62, was a faculty
member on the fall 2000 voyage
and loved ‘it all, even the
gale-force winds and 30-foot
waves that slammed SAS’s float-
ing campus, the S.S. Universe

. Explorer, on two occasions. “I

put on my foul-weather gear
and went out on deck,” recalled

,,..-,

».;»;,

Colavita, his mustache curling up
into a grin. “There were only two

other people out there, a couple

of students from Alaska.”

Eager to sail again — and
knowing that teaching faculty
usually must wait ﬁve years be fore
being considered for another
voyage — Colavita applied to be
academic dean.

Last spring, followinga round
of interviews, Institute for Ship-
board Education ofﬁcials offered
Colavita a deanship. “They asked
whether I would prefer a fall,
a spring or a summer voyage,”
he said. “I had mixed feelings
because I had really enjoyed the
fall itinerary.

“Ultimately, though, I chose
the summer because of the
European itinerary. My mother

was from Ireland, and my father
from Italy. My wife Harriet’s
family background is "Polish
and Russian. All four of those
countries were on the itinerary
for summer 2003 .” I

Until last June, anyway.

“In early June, Max\Brandt
[the institute’s chief academic
ofﬁcer] called me. in and said,
‘Um, Frank, it looks as if it’s not
going to be Europe next summer.
It’s going to be Asia.’”

At that tir'n‘e,">the Institute

for Shipboard Education was in
the final stages of negotiating
for year-round access to the

Universe Explorer. SAS had been

using that ship for its 10,0—day,
around-the—world fall and spring

‘ voyages since 1996. But during
summers, the ship’s owners

reclaimed it for tourist cruises
in Alaska. SAS summer voyages
employed a couple of smaller,
Mediterranean-based vessels
owned by other shipping com-
panies.

Julian Asenjo, SAS associate
director of enrollment manage-
ment, described the headaches

this caused: “After every spring

voyage, we would have to imme-
diately dismantle the Universe
Explorer as a ﬂoating college
campus — removing allyof the

chalkboards, classroom desks

and so forth— and then, just
as quickly, create a new campus
environment on the ship that
we were using for our summer
voyage.”

Year-round access to a single
ship would eliminate those har-
rowing makeovers and give SAS
a larger choice ofports. No
longer would summer voyages
be limited to coastal Europe,
North Africa and theiMiddle
East. (Because of post-Sept. 11
security concerns, last summer’s
itinerary waslimited to Europe
— the ﬁrst all-European Voyage
in SAS history.)

The Institute for Shipboard
Education considered relocating
summer voyages to Latin Ameri-

. can ports, butopted instead for

the Paciﬁc Rim because of SAS’s
long-standingrelationshipswith
cultural organizations, university
and government ofﬁcials, and
travel agents in those countries.

“Okay, fine, we’re going
to Asia and Alaska instead of
Europe,” Colavita remembers
thinking last June. “So I start
hiring Asian specialists. I recruit
an anthropologist, 'a“?bio'lo'gist,
a historian and so forth. Every-
thing’s going great.” _

But then, as" negotiations
with the Universe Explorer’s
owners dragged on into late
July, Colavita received another
voyage update. “I was told by

ISE [the Institute for Shipboard '

Education], ‘We haven’t dotted
the I’s and crossed the T’s yet,
Frank. There ’s a slight chance we
may be going back to Europe.’

“T/mt scared me.”

For 10 days, Colavita avoided
contact with prospective faculty
for the’ summer 2003 voyage.
“But then, luckily, ISE wrapped
up its negotiations,” Colavita
recalled. “We knew we’d have
the Universe Explorer, so we
would be going to the Paciﬁc
Rim.”

The Universe Explorer can
accommodate 650 students and
senior adult passengers, 200 more
than the ships used for previous
summer voyages. “I’ve hired
faculty for a student population
of about 450,” Colavita said. “If
the enrollment for next summer

goes up, I’ll have to hire more

faculty” — a prospect that hardly
intimidates a seasoned salt like
him. .

“During the fall 2 000 voyage,
our ship collided with a freighter
in the Saigon River [approaching
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam],
tearing a 30-foot gash in the
hull,” Colavita noted. Workers
welded metal plate over the
hull, painted it and the Universe
Explorer_sailed on.

“After leaving Asia, we
thought we were going to be
sailing through the Suez Canal
and on to the Mediterranean. A
lot of our curriculum was built

around places like Cairo and-
Istanbul,” Colavita said. But,
heeding State Departmentwarn— .

ings following the terrorist attack
on the SS. Cole in Yemen, _SAS
changed plans and sailed around

.So'uth. I Africa ninsteiadg wvisitirrg

Cape Town and Mombassa,
Kenya.

“After all of that, I’m not
too worried about recruiting a
few more professors for next
summer,” Colavita said, with a
laugh. “It’s no big deal.”

SEPTEMBER 12,2002

Close gap between Pitt facultypays
& AAU average salaries,

s Pitt prepares its state
appropriation request
or the next ﬁscal year,

a University Senate committee
is once again calling on the
administration to close the gap
between professors’ salaries here
and the average faculty pay
among Pitt’s fellow members
of the Association of American

_ Universities (AAU).

'In a Sept. 6 letter to Chan-
cellor Mark Nordenberg, the
Senate’s budget policies com-
mittee (BPC) recommended
increasing the pool of money
for faculty salaries by at least 4
percent for the ﬁscal year that
will begin on July 1, 2003.

“For more rapid improve-
ment in our comparative standing
[within the AAU], an increase of
5-6 percent would be desirable,”

» BPC members wrote.

“For several years,” the com-
mittee noted, “average faculty
salaries at Pitt have fallen well

, short of the University’s stated

goal of at least the median, for
each academic rank” within the
AAU, a group of prominent
North American research uni-
versities that includes public
institutions (Pitt and Penn State
among them)’ as well as private
schools such as Harvard and

' Stanford.

“This goal had been attained,
at least for some ranks, in the
early 1990s, but the‘ salary freeze

   

hav ‘

~d»:"'~ <>“,\‘.‘.. .'- -- .

increases in recent years
caused a signiﬁcant deterioration
in Pitt’s salary rankings with
respect to our peer institutions,”
BPC wrote. ,

Last, year, average salaries
among full professors at the
Pittsburgh campus trailed the
AAU median by $6,000, associ-
ates by $4,800 and assistants
by $2,900. Faculty librarians
ranked near the bottom of their
comparison group (AAU schools
that also belong to the Associa-
tion of Research Libraries) and
trailed the AAU/ARL median
by $6,400. The gap between
average salaries at Pitt regional
campuses and at AAU branch
campuses ranged between $800
and $6,800. .

“We appreciate Chancellor
Nordenberg’s recognition that
the recent history of salary
increases has put the University
at a comparative disadvantage,
and we welcome his decision to
support a 3.5 percent increase

~ in this year’s salary pool, despite
a 3.7, percent reduction in Pitt’s
state appropriation,” BPC’s letter
stated, a

The University faces a Sept,

20 deadline for submitting its FY
2003-04 state funding request to
Harrisburg. The annual request
includes, among other things,
Pitt’s proposals for salary and
tuition increases next year.
Senior administrators have not
decided on those proposals
yet, said Arthur G. Ramicone,
vice chancellor for Budget and
Controller.

BPC gives the chancellor
its own recommendations early

. each fall, in the hope that the

committee’s advice will ﬁgure
into the administration’s deci-

sion.

Harrisburg ofﬁcials are pro-
jecting a state budget shortfall
this year of $1.25 billion—$1.5
billion, Ramicone cautioned.

BPC acting chairperson Ste-
phen Carr said the best that Pitt
probably can expect from the
state next year is to avoid another
cut in funding.

Given the near—impossibility
of predicting accurately at this
time how Pitt’s 2003-04 state
appropriation will shape up,
BPC’s salary recommendation
“has exactly the same level of
realism” as the one that Pitt’s
administration will submit later
this month, Carr maintained.

BPC members seemed
ambivalent toward their own rec-
ommendation. Of the ﬁve voting
members who attended the Sept.

6 meeting, two endorsed the
' recommendation, "one voted

against it and two abstained.
Afterward, education profes-
sor Sean Hughes would not tell
the University Times why he
voted against the recommenda-
tion. But during the. meeting,
Hughes noted that Pitt’s adniin—
istration awarded double-digit

. salary raises twice during the

ears he’s worked here —— in
1976 and 1991, when Pitt faculty
were about to vote on whether
to unionize. (In both elections,
pro—union forces failed to garner
enough votes to form a faculty
iininn here)  ..

recommendations, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg told the
University Times: “VVhat I can
say at this. point is that salaries
will again be one of our‘ priori-

Bach to Bach .

 

BPC urges

ties, and the »[4 percent] salary
recommendation of the Senate
budget policies committee seems
to be reasonable. Certainly, an
even larger raise pool would
be desirable, but I think we do
need to be realistic in that this is
likely to be another challenging
year.”
Cl

For several years, administra-
tors have argued that Pitt should
benchmark its faculty salaries
against those of public AAU
schools only. They maintain
that the private AAU schools’
large endowments, high tuition,
specialized curricula and freedom
from state government regula-
tion enable them to pay higher
salaries than public AAU institu-
tions, and that the disparity of
wealth is growing each year.

During the 2001-02 academic
year, the average salaries of
Pittsburgh campus full professors
($95,800), associate professors
($65,400), assistant professors
($56,600) and faculty librarians
($48,600) continued to rank
among the bottom third among
61 AAU schools surveyed.

Comparing Pittsburgh cam-
pus salaries with those at the 34
public AAU schools only, Pitt
ranked 19th in average salary for
full professors, 21st for associate
professors and 19th for assistant
professors. The average salary

Responding ‘ “to ' the '9 B-PC 5 '

AAU/ARL schools.“ “

BPC chairperson Carr sug-
gested that it probably would be
more realistic for Pitt to shoot
for a new AAU comparison goal
— say, raising Pitt’s faculty pay

to the top one-ﬁfth among AAU
publics.

But he and other BPC mem-
bers said" Pitt professors should
continue to press for meeting the
original goal of raising faculty
pay to the median for the whole
AAU, until Senate groups and the
administration formally agree to
change that goal.

Pitt’s current health insurance

, contract with UPMC Health

System endsjune 30. Administra-
tors and Senate leaders alike have
warned that Pitt’s premiums may
increase by 25 percent or more
under a new contract.
Administrators, faculty and
staff involved in planning Pitt’s
2003-04 budget are expected to

Assume

consider whether employees —
especially lower—paid ones —
would be better off if Pitt paid
a larger share of their health
insurance premiums in lieu of
salary raises.

But BPC w0n’t push for that
approach to compensation.

Carr said: “In the long run, V

given the state funding situation,
it may well be that it makes sense
to put more money into beneﬁts
rather than salaries because then
it’s pre-tax compensation. But
that’s a case that would have to
be made by the administration
to the faculty.”

Faculty are unlikely to agree
among themselves on the issue,
Carr said.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Revised SAT will remain just 1

part of admissions pu

unveiled plans for a retooled

SAT that the board says will
better reﬂect what students learn
in high school. Beginning in
spring 2005, the test will include
a writing section, new reading
questions and more advanced
mathematics.

“The College Board says the
changes will relate more closely
to high school curriculums
and more accurately predict
a student’s performance in col-
lege,” said Betsy A. Porter, direc-
tor of Pitt’s Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid. “Some people,
myself included, say: ‘Well, that
remains to be seen.”’

Like some other university
admissions ofﬁcials — as well
as many high school guidance
counselors and students them-
selves — Porter has mixed feel-
ings about the SAT and standard-
ized tests in general. .

“There probably is no deﬁnit
answer as to whether standard-
ized tests are enormously or
somewhat helpful, or not helpful
at all,” she said. ‘.‘On the one hand,
it’s helpful to have something
in addition to individual high
school grades and class rankings,
something that reﬂects a national
norm. But I also think that
standardized tests can be very
harmful to students’ psyches
and can be especially damaging
to the very students who need
their academic self-conﬁdence
built up.

“From that perspective, I
think that tinkering with the
SAT in response to the criticisms

nn June, the College Board

that people have been offering

is a good move.”

Opponents of the test say it
is prejudiced in favor of students
whose families can afford SAT
coaching and prep courses, and
against low-income and minor-
ity students, who tend to do
poorly on standardized tests.
Overemphasis on SAT scores
has encouraged high schools to
design their curricula around
the test, critics say, a perversion
of the SAT’s original purpose of
measuring what potential college
students have learned.

Pressure to change the exam
had been growing since last
year, when the president of the
University of California system
proposed that the system develop
its own test (to include a writ-
ing section), eliminating the
SAT as an admissions require-
ment. Other university officials,
professional organizations and
op-ed writers joined the anti-
SAT chorus.

University of California ofﬁ-
cials have hailed the announced
changes in the SAT, and have
ceased talking about creating
their own alternative exam.

The new SAT will have three
sections instead of two, each
scored on a 200-800 scale:

° A “critical reading” section,
currently called the verbal sec-
tion. Word analogies (decried as
particularly lending themselves
to coaching) will be replaced
by paragraph—length reading
comprehension questions aimed
at testing students’ analytical
thinking.

0 A math section that will
include concepts taught through

zzle at Pitt

third-year high school algebra.

Currently, the math section stops

with concepts taught through
second-year geometry.

0 A new writing section,
which will include a 30-minute
handwritten essay that the Col-
lege Board will make available
to admissions offices via the
Internet.

A perfect score will no longer
bel1600, but 2400. The test’s
length will increase by 30 minutes
to three-and-a-half hours, and
the current $26 cost is expected
to jump by $10-$12.

At Pitt, SAT 3 scores have
always been just one part of
the admissions puzzle, Porter
emphasized. . -

“We don’t have a cut-off SAT
score for admission to Pitt,” she
said. “Standardized test scores
are not first, or last, on our list
of admissions criteria.”

“First and foremost” among
those criteria is a student’s high
school record, which includes

courses taken, grades received,

grade point average and, if
available, class rank, said Porter.
She and her staff also consider
standardized test scores, optional
essays and letters of recom-
mendation, leadership activities
and work experience.

Pitt used to require applicants
to submit a personal essay— until
high school guidance counselors
pointed out that there was no way
to tell how much’ help a student
received in writing such an essay
(or if the student contributed
at all).

“On the optional essays that

our applicants submit, we’re.

looking less for writing quality
than we are for information
about the student, things that
wouldn’t show up on a transcript
or test scores — for example,
health problems that might
explain absenteeism,” Porter
said.

Of the revised SAT’s new writ-
ing component, she predicted:
“Now that we will be getting
essays that students wrote under
pure laboratory conditions, so
to speak, what we’ll see are huge
disparities between students from
different schools. We will then
have to determine whether [those
disparities] are c11rriculum-based

or whether it’s because some --

kids really are better writers
than others.”

_ Porter has a personal as well
as professional interest in the
new SAT: Her son, Nlichael, will
be a high school junior during
the 2004-2005 academic year.
And, like the vast majority of
college—bound students, he plans
to take the SAT for the ﬁrst time
in the spring of his junior year

— when the new SAT will go
into effect.

Pitt has not set a policy yet
for changing over to the new
SAT, Porter said. But she offered
the following advice for students
who plan to apply to Pitt: “If
you’re going to be a high school
junior in spring2005 —‘meaning
you would be applying here the
following year, for admission
to Pitt during the 2006-2007
academic year — then you should
take the new SAT.”

Recently, ofﬁcials at ACT,
Inc. announced that they will
add an optional writing section
to the American College Test
entrance exam by the 2004-2005
academic year. A

The ACT is the SAT’s main
rival. Pitt requires applicants
to submit either SAT or ACT
scores, although most students
here take the SAT.

Details about the ACT’s new
writing section have not been
determined yet, ACT officials
said.

esponses in Serbia, Uru-
guay and the United
Kingdom to the Sept.
1 1, 2001, terrorist attacks all fol-

. lowed the same pattern, accord-

ing to Pitt professors who lived
in those countries at some point
during the last year.

In each nation, government
ofﬁcials condemned the attacks
and offered condolences.‘Private
citizens mourned and sympa-
thized with Americans they knew
—- even in Belgrade, which U.S.
forces bombed for 77 straight
days during 1999. Traditionally
taciturn Britons and Uruguayans
sought out visitors from the
United States, saying they hoped
the Americans’ families back
home were safe.

But people in each country
also wondered aloud (though
usually behind the Americans’
backs): Did Americans really
think their government could
unilaterally bomb civilians and
support despotic regimes around
the world without some of that

violence rebounding against

themselves? V

Governments and private
citizens alike in Serbia, Uruguay
and the U.K. also expressed
deep misgivings about America’s

military response to last Sept. .

1 1’s attacks, just as they currently
dread a U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Those composite responses
emerged during a forum yes-
terday on “September 11 —
Perspectives From Abroad,_”
presented by Pitt’s University
Center for International Studies
(U CIS) and Graduate‘ School of
Public and International Affairs

0 érating. "he discussion
in a packed 2K56 Posvar Hall
was William Keller, making his
ﬁrst public appearance.as the
inaugural holder of the Wesley
W. Posvar Chair in International
Security Studies and the new
director of Pitt’s Matthew B.
Ridgway Center for International
Security Studies, a joint program
of UCIS and GSPIA.

Panelists included history
professor Reid Andrews, sociol-
ogy professor Patrick Doreian
and Robert Hayden, professor
of anthropology and director of
UCIS’s Center for Russian and
East European Studies.

Hayden has spent six of the

_ last 20 years in Serbia, and was

there last September to develop

links between Pitt and Serbian ,

universities. Hayden speaks
Serbian, his wife is from Serbia,
one of their children was born
there, and the family owns a
home in Belgrade. His Serbian
friends pull no punches in talking
with him, he said.

. The Serbs’ reactions _ to
9-11-01? “Almost everyone said
it was a terrible tragedy, and
they meant it,” Hayden recalled.
“But then “a lot of people would
move on to a more delicate issue:
What had Americans expected,
after all? Yugoslavia was not

. the only country bombed by

the United States contrary to
international law, with no "sanc-
tion from the United Nations.”

In the past two decades alone,
he noted, the United States has

based on “lousy,” false intel-
ligence reports of biological
weapons production there). . .and
then there’s Iraq.

“Almost every week since
1991, the United States has
bombed Iraq, killing hundreds
of Iraqis, all with no cover from

    

The so-ca e no-ﬂyzones"that
the United States is enforcing
in Iraq were proclaimed by the
United States, not the U.N.
And so, the United States has
been taking unilateral aggres-
sive action against a member
state of the United Nations. In
international ‘law, it is very hard
to say that that isn’t aggression,
but we are, in fact, doing it.”

Virtually all of this U.S.
military action has been _done
from a distance “against people
who are,'quite literally, defense-
less,” Hayden said. And so, while
Serbs saw 9-11-01 as a tragedy,
they also wondered “why it
hadn’t occurred to Americans
that if America blithely bombs
countries at whim, at will, the
United States could trigger
attacks against itself. As a patriotic
American, I take that point very
seriously.”

Hayden accused the Bush
administration of defying inter-
national law, alienating other
nations and “raising cynicism to
an art fonn” by:

0 Seeking, through unilateral
aggression’, “to scrap the entire
structure of international rela-
tions that was created after
World War II” to prevent future
wars.

’° Refuting the Kyoto inter-
national agreements aimed at
preserving the environment.

° Chipping away at U.S.
citizens’ constitutional rights
in the name of fighting terror-
ism. Hayden urged audience
members to download from
the Web the federal American
Patriot Act of 2001 . “Among the
act’s provisions is the right of the
FBI to go to Pitt’s library and
ﬁnd out what I’ve been reading,”

 

Hayden said. “And if a librarian
tells me that [FBI agents] have
even been there, that librarian
has committed a criminal act.”

-0 Demanding that Serbia and
Croatia hand over alleged war
criminals to tribunals at The
Hague, while pressuring other
nations to sign agreements that
American soldiers will not, under
any circumstances, be extradited
to the fledgling international
court.

History professor Andrews’

was in Montevideo last Septem-
ber and encountered what he
called “amazing human solidarity
and concern and sympathy from
Uruguayans on the street.”
Uruguay’s democratically

‘ elected government, a center-
right coalition, expressed “com-

plete solidarity” with the United
States and condemned the Sept.
11 attacks. But the government
came out against the U.S.—led
invasion of Afghanistan, saying
it opposed state violence in all
forms.

Weeks after the attacks,
Andrews said, Uruguayans began
to express their lingering resent-
ment of the United States’
support of repressive military

..y

 

regimes during the 1960s, ’70s
and ’80s in their own country and
in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
other Latin American nations.
“A sizeable body of opinion
was saying, ‘We regret what
happened [on 9- 11 -O1] butreally,
when your country behaves like
this, do you think you’ll be
immune to having the same kind
of _death and destruction and
grief visited on your country?”

Andrews added: “N 0 one ever V

said this to my face” but such
opinions were widely expressed
in the press and on TV and radio
talk shows.

More extreme anti-American
views were heard in Uruguayan
universities, including the Fed-
eral University of Montevideo,
where Andrews had a fellow-
ship. . -

According
to Andrews,
many stu-
dents were convinced to vote
against this resolution by older
leftists, who argued that the
suicide bombers were “imbe-
ciles” who succeeded only in
strengthening U.S. imperialism,
giving the Bush administration
a perfect opening to take uni-
lateral military action and tram-

Sociolo-

said his

colleagues
offered him
their “pro—

tember. But
they also
expressed “a
bit of irrita-
tion and, per-
haps puzzlement,” he said, at the
United States’ apparent down-
playing of the deaths of non-
Americans (including several
hundred Britons) in the terrorist
attacks.

Later, Doreian said, Brits

shared their misgivings about
what theysaw as the Bush admiri-
istration’s “simplistic” you’re-
either-with-us-or-against-us
approach to the war against
terrorism — also, the Bush
administration’s imposition of
steel tariffs and its “shredding”
of the Kyoto agreement.

British support for an inva-
sion of Iraq “is diminishing very

-quickly,” Doreian opined, as is

national pride in Prime Minister
Tony Blair’s role in the war
against terrorism.

“Once, there was consider-

I Amen,

able pride that Tony Blair was
a far more articulate ‘speaker
in terms of the policies of the
Bush administration” than any
member of the administration
itself, Doreian said. “Though the
days of the ‘special relationship’
between the U.K. and the U.S.
are fading fast, there still was a
sense that it was nice that a British
representative was articulating
the U.S. position so well.

“I think that is changing,
and it’s changing quickly. Many

All three panelists said they
opposed a U.S. invasion of Iraq,
as did moderator Keller. T

“My sense is that a unilateral
U.S. air campaign and invasion
of Iraq would be a most costly
endeavor in terms of loss of life,
both American and Iraqi, and
possibly in terms of what the
CIA calls ‘blowback’ —— that is,
retribution which might lead
_later to actions visited on North
American cities, on the American
people, in direct response to our
foreign policy,” said Keller.

“My personal belief is that a
war in Iraq is not going to be like
the last time around,” he said.
“It’s going to involve, probably, a
retreat into Baghdad and a very
costly house-by-house, block-
by—block military campaign”
with full coverage by CNN and
other news media. TV viewers
throughout the world would be
subjected to images of American
servicemen killed and mutilated,
and Iraqi children blown up by
U.S. bombs, Keller said.

He noted a “real division”
among conservatives and even‘
within the Bush administration
toward war against Iraq‘. “The
administration feels it must be
pro-active, fearing some new
catastrophe will occur and they
will be held responsible,” Keller
said. Other conservatives, he sug-

-gested, believe America would

be playing into the terrorists’
hands by invading Iraq —— setting
off a chain reaction that would
destabilize the Middle East and
damage U.S. interests.

Thousands of members of the Pitt community met on the lawn between the’
Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Chapel Wednesday to commemorate the victims
of the Sept. 11. 2001. terrorist attacks. A bagp'per opened the morning ceremony
with "Amazing Grace," then Chancellor Mark Nordenberg addressed the crowd.
Community members were invited to place flags on the lawn, each of the 3,041
flags labeled with the name of a victim of the attacks. Staff, faculty and students
v‘ ‘ted the display throughout the day, then at 5 p.m. were encouraged to take
the flags. A

After a serv‘ce in Heinz Chapel at 7 p.m., the University lit 911 lumlnarias, which

Insulin resistance, a condition
commonly associated with the
development of type 2 diabetes,
is likely a major cause of kidney
disease, or nephro_pathy, in
people with type 1 diabetes,

according to study results pub- _

“Kidney disease is a major.

explanation for its cause beyond
blood sugar itself,” said principal

Of the 658 subjects in PEDCS,

Fifty-six of the 485 subjects

Researchers found that in all
cases, strong relationships existed
betweennephropathyandinsulin

stands out as the leading predic-
tor of kidney disease in this
study,” Orchard said.

Other risk factors in those
that developed nephropathy
included elevated LDL (“bad”)

cholesterol, triglycerides, white"

blood cell count and blood
pressure.

“The good news is that not all
people with type 1 diabetes are
insulin resistant, and for them
the risk of kidney disease now
appears to be low,” Orchard said.
“Even for someone with type 1
diabetes who is genetically pre-
disposed to insulin resistance, the
secret to avoiding nephropathy
may well be to prevent insulin
resistance through lifestyle
changes such as proper diet,
exercise, smoking cessation and
perhaps medication.

“Another intriguing ﬁnding
from this study is that since
insulin resistance also predicts
heart disease,” he continued,
“it may explain the longstand-

computation and storage of
information. In his research,
Snoke used laser light to separate
an electron from an atom. The
“excited” electron plus the hole
remaining on the atom compose

an exciton, which moves like

an energy particle and could
potentially carry information.

In most cases, excitons exist
for only a few nanoseconds
(billionths of a second) and travel
only a few microns (millionths
of a meter) before the electron
and hole reunite and re—emit
the light.

Byusing the quantum wells -
fabricated from gallium arsenide
and indium gallium arsenide by
scientists at Lucent Technolo-
gies’ Bell Laboratories —— Snoke
and his team were able to extend
the amount of time the electron
and hole were apart and, conse-
quently, the distance the exciton
traveled.

“A millimeter may notseem
like a long distance, but with
circuits now being designed
on micron scales — that is,
thousandths of a millimeter -
a distance of a millimeter is
tremendously long compared to
typical circuit dimensions,” said
Snoke. “Therefore, the exciton
particles can easily travel over the
distances needed for computer
circuits.

“These results open up the
possibility of using excitonic
signals to carry information

just as an electronic charge is
currently used,” said Snoke.
“Today’s computer technology
is based on sending electronic
charges from place to place to
carry information. Our new
experiments may open up the
possibility of ‘excitonics’ as a new
way of sending information.”

According to Snoke, previous
experiments at Pitt have already
shown that it is possible to apply
a force on excitons to move them
from one place to another using
either pressure or an electric
ﬁeld. Given Snoke’s recent
results, the possibility now exists
for excitonic circuits in which
excitons are routed from one

' place to another.

GSPH to set up health preparedness center

The Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH) is estab-
lishing a Center for Public
Health Preparedness with a $1
million grant from the Centers
for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC).

The new GSPH center is one

. of 1 5 CDC-sponsored prepared-

ness centers nationwide charged
with training the nation’s public
health, health care and public
safety workforce in responding
to terrorist incidents, infectious
disease outbreaks and /other
public health threats. The fund-
ing is part .of the $2.9 billion
in bioterrorism appropriations
signed in January by President
Bush.

The Center for Public Health
Preparedness at Pitt will cover
training of public health, health
care and public service profes-
sionals in Pennsylvania and
Ohio. The principal investigator
is Margaret Potter, associate
dean for public health practice at

UPMC Cancer Centers has
launched a new web site -
www.upmccancercenters.com
— to provide patients with the
latest and most comprehensive
information about cancer as well
as the treatment programs and
services available across UPMC
Health System.

“The UPMC Cancer Centers
web site is a valuable resource
for cancer patients that provides
information in understandable
language and in a format that
makes the information easy to
locate,” said Michael Becich,
director of the Benedum Oncol-
ogy Informatics Center at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute. “As more cancer
patients rely on the web to
understand their disease and
make decisions about their treat-
ment, it is important that web-

The web site is organized into
three main areas that include
cancer information, expert treat-

-_ment and clinical trials. By click-

ing on cancer information, site
visitors can access comprehensive
information about prevention,
screening, diagnosis, staging and
treatment for more than 70 types
of cancer. _

The expert treatment link

provides informationabout the .

patient care programs available
throughout the UPMC Cancer
Centers network of more than
30 hospital— and ofﬁce—based
medical oncology practices.

Clicking on clinical trials
allows patients to access a list’ of
ongoing clinical research studies
for specific types of cancer and to
explore potential new treatment
options.

The web site also provides
the latest in cancer news and
allows patients to ﬁnd a UPMC
Cancer Centers location and
physicians close to home, ask
questions on—line, ﬁnd support
services and take a virtual tour of
the new Hillman Cancer Center,
the 'main hub of the UPMC
Cancer Centers, scheduled to
open at UPMC Shadyside this
October.

Before the launch of the web

site, ca_ncer information was .

available on the UPCI’s web site.
While that web site will still
be on—line, it will focus on the
research and academic cancer-
related activities at UPCI and
Pitt.

The UPMC Cancer Cen-
ters site was made possible
through the support of the
Claude Worthington Benedum
Foundation and the Emma Clyde
Hodge Memorial Fund.

for cancer research funded

The Pennsylvania Cancer
Alliance (PCA), a group of six
cancer institutes in the state, has
been awarded $5 .5 million by
the Pennsylvania Department of

, Health to create a bioinformatics

consortium for cancer research.

The consortium is expected
to help establish Pennsylvania as
a leader in translational cancer
research and technology and
foster new understanding of the
disease.-

Led by investigators at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute (UPCI), the consortium
is based on a unique collabora-
tion — the first of its kind in the
nation — seeking to promote
cancer research throughout the
state by using funds provided
by a settlement between the

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ‘
' and tobacco companies. '

“We are grateful to Gov.
Schweiker and the state legisla-
ture for allocating tobacco settle-
ment funds for health research

to address the very unfortunate

legacy of tobacco use in Pennsyl-
vania,” said Ronald B-. Herber-
man, principal investigator of the
consortium, director of UPCI
and associate vice chancellor for
cancer research at Pitt.
According to Herberman,
enhancing cancer care in Penn-
sylvania is a priority given the
more‘ than 75,000 Pennsylva-
nians who were diagnosed with
cancer in 2001, and the nearly
30,000 expected to die from the
disease this year. UPCI joined
forces with Fox Chase Cancer
Center, Kimmel Cancer Center
at Thomas Jefferson Univer-
sity, University of Pennsylvania

Cancer Center, Penn State
Cancer Institute and the VV1star
Institute to form PCA in 1998
with the goal of conducting
interdisciplinary and cross-
institutional research among
large teams of investigators.
The bioinformatics consor-

' tium created by PCA will allow

data about specific types of
cancers as well as dataifrom
clinical trials to be amassed,

connected and easily available to

researchers through an accessible

database. 1

“Traditionally, it has been
difficult for researchers to ﬁnd
sufficient and speciﬁc tumors
and tissues necessary to develop
new biomarkers, the indicators
that distinguish cancer from
non-cancer,‘ and to adequately
understand disease mechanisms,”
said Michael Becich, co-principal
investigator, director of UPCI’s
Benedum Oncology Informatics
Center and director of the Center
for Pathology Informatics at
UPMC Health System and Pitt.
“The consortium will allow us to
create a biorepository of serum
and tissue samples which, in
turn, puts us in a better posi-
tion as a group to compete for
funding to advance cancer and
bioinformatics research.”

A major goal of the consor-
tium is to facilitate collaborations
not only among researchers who
are members of PCA, but also
with outside collaborative part-
ners such as biotech companies,
the Life Sciences Greenhouses
andresearchersandinstitutionsout-
side of the consortium to energize
economic growth throughout the
state. I
