Model U. N. lets high school students tackle issus

of nuclear weapons, «water rights,Narco-terrorisrn  

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

Ben Dills was not sitting in his high
school classroom this Monday afternoon.
A senior at North Allegheny High School,
Dills was not playing hooky, either —— he
was playing the United States.

Dressed in a nice shirt, tie and khakis,
Dills represented the United States at
Pitt’s Model United Nations simulation.-
Held at the Wﬂﬁarn Pitt Union, the event
drew more than 365 students from 32 dif-
ferent schools.

The students represented more than
56 different nations, as well as the coun-
tries of the African Union, which were
represented in an additional simulation
offered at the conference.

“It’s amazing how 30 people can talk
for hours about nothing,” Dills said, dis-
cussing the roadblocks students faced in
their simulation of diplomatic policy.

The goal of the simulations was for
students to form resolutions on pressing
issues that face the world today.

Some of the topics included reduc-
tion of the small-arms trade, space-based
nuclear weapons, water rights, domestic

violence, peacekeeping missions, the
Falkland Islands, AIDS education and
Narco-terrorism.

To form a consensus on answers to
these problems, students had to compro-
mise with other nations to form resolu-

Deciding upon little procedures can end

Ashley ‘Faust, I Secretary General for

.his most recent lament,

Lee Gutkind celebrates
book, life as a fat kid

JONATHAN M. KYLE
Staff Writer

Captivating the crowd with
compelling banter and humorous
commentary, Lee Gutkind launched
which
examines the life of a literary lumi-
nary —— namely himself.

He looked back on the career
that compelled Vanity Fair’s James
Wolcott to declare
Gutkind the “godfa-
ther behind creative
nonfiction.”

Gutkind, the for-
mer director of Pitt’s
writing program and
a V nationally
acclaimed author,
held a release party
Monday night for his
newest ' book,
“Forever Fat: Essays
by the Godfather.” 4

London.

In the book, Gutkind recalled
some of themore colorful elements
of hischildhood, including growing
up as a “fat kid” in Greenfieldand
Squirrel Hill.

“For my bar mitzvah, I had to
get a size-44 wool suit,” Gutkind
recalled. “I realized I was bigger
than all of the elders, and they were
five times my age.”

Gutkind’s series of readings put
his audience on an emotional roller
coaster as they traveled from his
somber stories about organ trans-
plants, read from his book, “Many

Sleepless Nights,” to hilarious tales
of ﬂying on a plane with his family,
from “Forever Fat.”

Gutkind is the founder of the
Creative Nonfiction Foundation,
the “first, and now most distin-
guished, literary magazine devoted
to creative nonfiction,” according
to the CNF. 

Gutkind left for the National
Guard in Atlantic City not long
after he finished high
school, which he left

 

He recalled
abuse one black com-
patriot received from
a racist drill sergeant,
and how‘that inspired
him to overcome his
 struggles.

‘ “I became slim,

cut,” Gutkind said. “I

After his term of

chose to follow his
dream of riding around the country
on a motorcycle, which he
described in great detail in another
excerpt from his book.

Gutkind received his bachelor’s

degree in general studies from Pitt .

and has been a teacher here since
1970.

During his time at Pitt, he has
written several books, including
“Bike Fever,” “The Best Seat in
Baseball,” and “The People of

Anime is a style of animation
unique to Asia, especially Japan,
where, according to Roach, the
anime industry makes more money
than live-action films.

Animes are different from
Western cartoons in several regards.
American cartoons, like Looney
Toons, are marketed mostly towards
children. Animes, on the‘ other hand,
appeal to a wider variety of people
and age groups. There are anime
dramas, murder mysteries, romantic
comedies and, yes, even pornos.

“In Japan, they have realized
that animation is an art form,’_’
Roach said. “Animation is more
ﬂexible than live action.”

That explains the outrageous
characteristics of most animes.

“It’s a very outrageous and
funny show,” Roach said. “There’s a
lot of comedy and action.” ’

Roach, who graduated from Pitt

Comic Book Club of the early
1990s, Roach explained.

Over the years, club members
slowly brought Japanese anime into
the equation.

By 1996, what began as a forum
where comic book fanatics could
argue over whether Batman could
take Superman in a fight evolved
i_nto a dedicated group of about 40
to 50 anime followers who thrive
off of each other’s knowledge.

EDITORIAL

Expanding the Big East good for Pitt

In a move that makes the Big East

Conference a little bigger and a little

less eastern than it once was, the con-
ference added Cincinnati, Louisville,
South Florida, Marquette and DePaul.
The latter two will not be joining for

. football.

This swell in size comes a few
months after Virginia Tech, Miami
and Boston College defected to the
Atlantic Coast Conference, and
stands to make the Big East the
nation’s top basketball conference.
Although this change may mean that
the Big East’s Bowl Championship
Series bid may not be renewed in
three years, should it not be, the con-
ference will then be at the top of the
non-BCS Division I-A teams.

All this is good news for Pitt. Pitt
will be a big fish in a little pond,
rather than the nurse shark in a tank
full of hammerheads that we were
before.'And it was the Big,East’s best
available option ——- not that there
were many others. A _

Being part of a basketball-orient-
ed conference can only mean good
things for Pitt’s programs: higher

rankings/ and better opponents, for

example. Because no matter how
firmly Pitt trounces suck-tastic teams
like Arkansas-Pine Bluff or Chicago
State, Pitt’s rankings will not improve
until their opponents do.

Pitt’s new conference—mates seem I

like worthy opponents. Marquette
beat Pitt to go to the Final Four last
year, Cincinnati and Louisville both
have high—profile coaches, and
DePaul fares better than Virginia
Tech, Miami or Boston College at
basketball. I

Of course, none of these new
additions create the geographic rival-
ry that Pitt so needs —- West Virginia
is too busy setting things on fire to
inspire the necessary froth and vehe-
mence required for true rivalry.

Cincinnati is the closest of the bunch,’

but still mired in the depths of Ohio. I

Yet the Big East is something of a
misnomer— it’s the Big East(ern
Midwest) now, with UConn, South
Florida and Marquette demarcating
the edges. This is fitting — it’s not as

if the other conferences have names‘

that make particular sense. The
Atlantic Coast Conference could be
renamed the Southern Coast
Conference with token—Yankee

Boston College, and the Big Ten has

11 schools.
Which conference Pitt belongs to

is one of the many things that affects ,

its sports programs —_ an important
component, though not the .sole factor
in determining Pitt sports’ future. But
for now, we can rest easy‘ knowing
that _the Big East’s status as a basket-
ball conference will be one of the best
in history. A

If Halloween is about
being naughty, no one topped
my girlfriend’s friend, who
went as sexy Alice, with the
words “drink me” written
above her left breast. Of
course, the costume was made
by those two words, and
would have been just as terrif-

wearing it had been wearing

 

_ that 16 percent of the average

woman’s costume covered
parts that are traditionally considered to be
inside the body. And the ﬁgure was only so
low because, obviously,‘many women did
not ﬁt into the stereotype of sexy. costumes.
‘Of course, the women who did wear them
didn’t really ﬁt into them either. '
Furthermore, how can one really be a

ioned, but I don’t think I’m wrong in saying
that leopards should only be sexy to other
leopards.
My costume was nothing special. After
a hectic week of school, offering no free
time for costume anangement, I scrapped
my plans, instead opting to go as “man
wearing clothes” — which was a step up
from third grade, when I went as Pittsburgh
Pirate legend Roberto Clemente, donning
brown body paint to complete the eﬁect.
When we learned about blackface in high
school history, I had a special, nostalgic
memory of the time when I honored the
man I respected most by continuing a prac-
tice that many black people ﬁnd insulting.
Not all of the costumes this year were
as bad as minehistorically have been — or
as bad as almost all of the sexy costumes
were. ~

more clothing.

But it simply can’t be
about dressing sexily and getting drunk, can
it? Anyone can do either or both on any
given day. How then, at college, could that
make a day any more of a-holiday than, say,
your average Tuesday? There was just no
adventure..A sexy devil ‘is just a devil, and is,
therefore, a tired Halloween convention that
is only interesting to the extent that scantily
clad women are interesting.

Which probably means that a lot of my
peers found this Halloween fascinating. As
well they should. I don’t really get into see-
ing a lot of anonymous women roaming
nearly naked, through the streets, but if they
have frm doing it, then they should, by all
means.

But the laundry fairy comes only once '

a year, and angels in lingerie —— of which
there were hundreds at Pitt on Friday -
come with every V1ctoria’s Secret catalog.

So next year, I hope to see costumes
that are sexy, but also a bit more. I’ve
already got mine. I’m going -to be a sexy
platypus.

THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, November 5, 2003

The 2000 election debacle was the
kind of political joyride this country hasn’t
had since, well, I have to go back to the

Teapot Dome scandal. It started small, in

Florida, but soon captured the country’s
imagination, spreading to the water cooler
and the late-night television monologue.
Hipsters were having “Intent-of-Voter
Parties,” enjoying democracy in the only
way they knew how — through irony.
Like most fads, it couldn’t last. Too
brieﬂy, that candle was snuffed out,
remembered only with nostalgic slang,
“Hey, how’s your chad hanging?” The
next generation of voters may never expe-

rience the thrill of month—long recounts,’

the drama of legal wrangling and the satis-
fying release of a landmark Supreme
Court ruling.

Because computers are going to ﬁx
everything — or will they?

The Help America Vote Act, passed
last October, promises $3.9. billion to the

states for replacing older voting technolo— *
gy — the punch card—and-lever machines.

at the heart of the Florida Farce. This is an
unprecedented amount _of money for vot-
ing reform, which most states are devoting
to computerized voting machines similar
to ATMS. In fact, 37 states have deployed
the machines, most made by a company
named Diebold. ,

Think back to the last time your com-
puter crashed. The Diebold machines are
basically desktop computers running spe-

cial software — except when they crash or
malfunction, it’s not pirated
MP3s that disappear, but
votes.

This is the problem with
computer voting machines:
they don’t work. Not only do
they not work, but also, unlike ‘
with your home computer,
you,’ as a voter, are not
allowed to know they don’t
work. You know when
Windows devours your. phi-
losophy paper; with electron-
ic voting, . there’s no indica-
tion when the machine fouls up.

How did this happen? After all, our
tax dollars are going into Diebold’s pock-
ets to pay for these machines. But the
company insists on strict secrecy regard-
ing its voting machines; operating on them
without Diebold’s permission is a felony.
T'here’s no way for a voter, or even an
election administrator, to conﬁrm that
votes are being counted accurately. The
only way to check election results is after
all the votes have been cast, an essentially
useless feature, because if a machine mal-
functions or is tampered with, there’s no
accurate count to check it against.

Incidentally, a leaked memo from
Diebold contains the quote, “If voting
could really change things, it would be
illegal,” according to the Oct. 14 The
Independent, of London. Just so you have

an idea of the mindset at the company.

Georgia, which imple-
mented Diebold’s machines
enthusiastically, held its mid-
term elections last
November, as the first state to
convert entirely to computer-
ized voting.

The results were suspi-
cious, to say the least. Two
fairly close races saw sudden
swings of double-digit per-
centages on Election Day.
The Republican Senate can-
didate scored noticeably
higher in the Democrat south, while the
Democratic candidate scored remarkably
higher in the Republican-held north of the
state. . ‘

. Despite, the fuzzy numbers and calls

by computer scientists for a secure, .

accountable system, the head of the
Georgia Technology Authority, Larry
Singer, who’d brought the machines in,

. dismissed all criticism as “fear of technol-

ogy.”

Singer is right, but doesn’t go far
enough. The criticism is motivated by fear
of technology that doesn’t work, and fear
of seeing that technology deployed» with-
out any accountability.

Critics of the system are asking for
simple things: a veriﬁable printout of each
vote cast, in case of a manual recount, and
a system that is secure from tampering;

Computerized voting machines shouldn’t be trusted

Diebold has refused both, claiming a
printout is unfeasible — while thousands
of ATM receipts are printed every day by
similar machines — and refusing to open
its software to public scrutiny.

The company hides behind trade
secrecy laws, but when a copy of the soft-
ware found its way onto the Internet, pro-
fessional programmers tore it to pieces for
its insecurity and poor implementation.
One has to wonder if embarrassment
might be a factor in their refusal to open
the machines.

The electronic voting controversy
stands at the nexus of several current
social concerns. There’s the specter of
2000; no state wants to be caught with its
chad hanging out. There’s the belief that
technology is a magical black box into

which votes’ go and democracy comes out,
— we don’t really need to know how it‘

works! *

‘Most disturbingly, there’s the colli-
sion of corporate secrecy with the practice
of actual democracy, where openness and

accountability are the only ways to ensure ‘

the public is served. I hope the people
elected with those archaic punch card-
and-lever machines remember on which
side of the divide they stand.

Not keeping the faithi Catholicism and my right hand

Have you ever thought about how, in the era when
Jesus Christ masturbated, He had very few options for ade-
quate lube? Well if you haven’t, maybe you should. It
might just change your life. I know it changed mine.

Let’s hop in the Way Back Machine and revisit a time
when I was just a little boy in Catholic school, Bible in one
hand, big sack of naive innocence in the other. Embedded
into my brain forever is the mental tl1ird—degree burn that
scarred my seventh grade religion class — the day
our teacher told us that masturbation was a mortal sin.
For those of you not down with the Catholo-speak,
mortal sins are the baddest marnmajamrnas of all
unholy deeds. Murder, for example, is a mortal sin.

Mortal sins stick on your soul for the rest of your
life and can only be forgiven by God Himself through ‘
the blessed sacrament of reconciliation —— or by send-
ing $29.95 to Jeny Falwell.

For almost a year after that sexual Three Mile
Island, I would stand nervously in the shower, afraid
to “let my fingers do the walkin ” because I was cer-
tain that the ﬂoor would then immediately cave in and

I would fall straight into Hell. Let’s just say one day -
the dam burst, but after I did the deed for the ﬁrst time, I
was so riddled with fear and shame that I almost rode my
Huffy straight to church to beg for redemption.

Remember those old drug commercials with the egg .'

and the ﬂying pan? Kids, this is your brain —— empty fry-
ing pan is shown. Well, this is your brain on Catholicism
—— Molotov cocktail is thrown into frying pan.

That’s pretty much what my halo-adomed head felt
like up until high school, where sex wasn’t just non-taboo;

it was ﬂat-out celebrated. Health class was delicious blas-
phemy. It proved that rational, sane people choked , the
chicken regularly and that what my girlfriend and I did on
Friday night wasn’t committing us to eternal damnation.
I’m scared to think about where I would be right now
had I not started questioning my faith. For the time being,
that questioning has caused me to ﬂush» my Catholicism

down the toilet, along with the eight years of crap they fed ’

my head. I don’t feel bad about tearing
up the entire root system that was my
youth because, well, it wasn’t my root
system. It was the Church’s, or my
religion teacher’s, or my parents’ —
anyone’s but mine. .
VV1th books like “The Da Vmci

bestseller list, more and more people

are experiencing various forms of _reli-. ,

gious friction. On the one hand, some
are angry over facts contradictory to

church dogma being talked about in
, ' the papers. Others’ are scared that the
institution that they’ve followed their whole lives may be
a sham. Most are at least a little confused.

But this is a good thing.

I learned at an early age while debating with my athe-
ist friend that, if you have no faith, your tiny shreds of evi-
dence would quickly disintegrate when under scrutiny. On
the other hand, if you truly have faith, you’ll know it
because it can stand up to even the harshest contradictory

of my rock-solid Catholic beliefs that could not be torn-
apart by the most persuasive of arguments. '

For some people, just being confronted by opinions

beliefs.  ,
- But I had to put my faith to the test. My Catholicism
collapsed later not because anyone convinced me other-
wise, but because I let it cave in. Dissectingmy soul was
scary at ﬁrst, but nothing worth doing is ever easy.

Because of it, I now have a belief system, one that I’m
happy adhering, to — one that lets me rub one off guilt-
free. Because I bet Jesus did, too. I bet He was boppin’ the
bishop before there even were bishops. I mean, He was a
guy, and do you know any guyswho haven’t stolen their
mothers’ hand cream and trolled the upper cable chaimels

for scrambled pom? OK, maybe the Son of God didn’t do .

A Last Sunday, the Mattress Factory, a
modem-art museum located in the Mexican
War Streets on the North Side, unveiled

eight new installations to the public. Places i
like the Mattress Factory prove that there’s a ‘

lot more to Pittsburgh than the Original Hot
Dog Shop and the Steelers, if you only take
the time to look ‘ -

For those not familiar with the Mattress
Factory, describing it as a modem—art muse-
um isn’t quite accurate. Founded in 1977,
the Mattress Factory exhibits only installa-
tion art; each artist who contributes an instal-

lation must create it speciﬁcally for the space
the Mattress Factory allots them In other
words, no traveling exhibits come to the
Mattress Factory ,—— each installation is a
new and original «work While the artists
who are chosen to create an installation for
the Mattress Factory are working on their
piece, the museum provides them with
housing, a stipend and any materials they
might need. You can imagine the kinds of
crazy requests the museum staff gets —
once, a Japanese artist requested 5,000
pounds_of wax so he could carve a room out

.ofit

One of the new installations that dis-
played good use of space was the work of
Ann‘Reichlin. She welded metal road—repair
materials together and hung them from the
ceiling. These hanging metal rectangles cre-
ate interesting, almost maze—like structures
for the viewer to walk through, and when the
light hits this piece, it is especially beautiful.

Artist Rebecca Holland needed a lesson
in candy making in order to complete her
installation project, which is called “Glaze.”
Her original plan was to cover the ﬂoor of
her space, which is about 700 square feet,

with apple-green Jolly Rancher candies.

Unfortunately, the Jolly Ranchers didn’t
react well to the humidity in the ﬁrst—ﬂoor
room. Holland had to turn to the Pittsburgh

apple-green colored candy, and the color is

him about four weeks.

The last notable installation was Liza
McConnells’. This piece is truly interactive,
as you have to climb onto a treadmill and
start walking to view it. As you walk, the
lights that surround the treadmill go out and

the wall in front of you becomes a screen

onto which is projected a View of the night
sky and a road, with orange cones on either
side, that appears to move forward as you
walk You might think this image is a photo-
graph that has been treated and projected
onto the wall, but, in fact, it is a camera
obscura device, and the artist used common
materials like cotton balls to create the pro-
jected image.

A Other new installations include a two-
room project by Lynne Yamamoto that
explores her J apanese—American heritage
and her farnily’s experiences working on the
Dole-owned‘ pineapple plantations in
Hawaii. Margo Sawyer created a beautiful

installation of glass objects that are illurni- ‘

nated from the inside and gradually change
color as you watch them -in the dark room;
they are housed in. Curtis Mitchell’s installa-
tion is characteristic of his style —— he dam-
ages everyday objects by burning or bleach-
ing them and then sets about repairing them.
Finally, Ara Peterson, Jim Drain and Eamon
Brown worked together to create a large pro-
ject that combines digital imagery with enor-
mous, painted, threedimensional objects.
This new show is truly extraordinary —
it’s difﬁcult to express in words the experi-
ence of viewing and actually being inside
these installations. The Mattress Factory is a
bit out’ of the way for" most Pitt students, but
the trip will be well worth it, and since this
exhibition will be open until June 27, 2004,
there is no excuse not to go experience it

Love is in the air times 10

Love Actually

Starring Liam Neeson, Hugh
Grant, Colin Firth, Alan
Rickman, Emma Thompson
Directed by Richard Curtis
7i‘n1‘4'7k

With the holiday season fast
approaching," very nearly washed-up
musician Billy Mack (Bill Nighy)
records a “festering turd” of a
Christmas record. The rocker may
not be in the holly, jolly Christmas
mindset, but the rest of England is
scrambling to score a spot beneath
the mistletoe. ’ i ,

Directed by Richard Curtis,
“Love Actually” weaves together 10
tales of romance to convince us that
.love, as the prime minister (Hugh
Grant) puts it, “actually is all
around.” The “Magnolia”-like struc-
ture breaks down the conventions of
uni-couple romantic comedies by
sampling stories from the full spec-
trum of love and loss‘.

The slew of scenarios in “Love

Actually” hammers home love’s

ability to transcend language, age,
race and gender. Shy Jamie (Colin
Firth) can’t understand a word of his
housekeeper’s Portuguese, yet as the
two draw closer, they settle into the
same nonverbalwavelength. Age is
hardly an issue for 11-year-old Sam
(Thomas Sangster), who matter-of-
factly informs his stepfather (Liam
Neeson) that he’s certainly not too
young to experience “the total agony
of being in love.” _

Romance blossoms everywhere,
even among casually conversational
porn star stand-ins eager for a cup of
coffee after a round of simulated
sex. The political arena is. no less
vulnerable"; although love at first

sight is “terribly inconvenient” for _

the not-so-suave prime minister, it
kindles the fire necessary to con-
front the demeaning American
President (a randy Billy Bob
Thornton) in an explosion of epic
music and British pride. Curtis neat-
1y tucks the nationalistic undertones
into the other stories by infusing the
same brand of comedy into political
life, including the prime minister’s
propensity to boogie behind closed
doors. .
Because of the connection of
characters through friendship, blood
or coincidence, their stories are deft-
ly woven together rather than
butting against each other as a series
of vignettes. Sardonic Billy and his

~ ridiculous hit single surface in each

story, evoking a laugh every time
and reinforcing a sense of unity. But
even the “old ex-heroin addict” can’t
dodge Cupid for long, and he, too,
falls headfirst into love.

 

Curtis holds the adventures of 10

pairs — or the occasional trio —- on.

tight leashes, lingering, on snippets
of tales long enough to develop the
characters while keeping the come-
dy fresh and fast-paced. Each thread
ties up neatly, though not always
happily, ending on a general note of
contentedness and evading the
genre’s trap of implausible fantasy
fulfillment.

With a ‘loaded cast and snappy
dialogue, “Love Actually” conquers
all —— even those of us as reluctantly
romantic as Billy Mack.

Mr. Roboto Project enters fourth
year and celebrateswith ADD Fest

Clubs in the area are closing down left and
right, but one has managed to stay above it all for
four years. The Mr. Roboto Project, located in
the heart _of Wilkinsburg, is well known for
putting on shows, as well as having a ‘zine
library and art gallery. For its fourth anniversary,
the venue will hold it’s annual Attention Deficit
Disorder Fest, featuring bands that play 10 to 20
minute sets, as implied by the name. The short
times are used so no one will grow too bored
with a band.

Mike Roth was one of the main organizers of
Roboto. He’s known as “Q” to everyone, includ-
ing his girlfriend. He was one of about 20 who
had a mission to start a true do—it-yourself club
that would promote local shows and support
bands. “Many shows that now happen at Roboto
would’ve happened at houses, colleges, or some
other venues that would sporadically allow
shows. The main issue was control; control over
our situation, including what type of shows we
wanted to do, how we wanted to do them, keep-

PDavid Stein — a

engineering major at
Carnegie Mellon
University who also
was the administra-
tor/moderator for
Pittpunk.com, a Web
site that helped support
Roboto as well as his
shows —‘— also sees the
birthday as special.

“It means that it’s been around Pittsburgh
longer than I have. Not that places like Roboto
are unheard of, but making it through. four years
says something about how it’s run — how well
it’s appreciated‘ here in Pittsburgh, and it also

‘ says that it’s likely to be around a

Pittsburgh venues,” Stein said. “I

immensely. I think it may be my
favorite part about Pittsburgh and
probably the ‘one I’ll miss the most
when I leave.”

Stein is right. Roboto has been
through quite a bit in its four years,
from the Roboto II being opened
and then shut down" for fire -code
violations, to a theft in August,
where $3,000 worth of public
address equipment was stolen. But
even through this adversity, Q
remains optimistic. , ‘

“Our main priority is to contin-
ue to_ offer the best example of do-
it-yourself in action that we can. We
just want to continue to do shows,
empowering kids to take control,
whether that be booking shows’,
playing in bands, putting out
records, making art [or] getting

respect what the Roboto kids do

involved in their communities in some other way.
"Our main purpose is -to show people that by
working together they can make awesome things
happen,” Q said. I -

; You’d think after four years, the idea would
beto keep the formula the same. However, future
plans for Roboto were explained by Q, as well.

“As an extension of this, we are also hoping
to take Roboto to the next level up. We are cur-
rently looking to buy a building, thus moving
Roboto into a bigger location and hopefully
allowing us to expand our activities. We have
been talking with the people of (Project 1877 who
are getting evicted from their space at the end of
the month, about working together to create a
space where our two projects can complement
each other’s activities nicely.”

, Roboto is one of the strongest" things
Pittsburgh’s music scene has going for it these

"days, and it’s almost a birthright for any fan of

indie, punk, hardcore, metal, emo, jazz, art and
music in general to attend this show.

International Poetry Forum remembers Dylan Thomas 50 years after his death

In a 1939 poetry review, Dylan
Thomas wrote, “Too much poetry is
ﬂat on the page, a black-and-white
thing of words created by intelligences
that no longer think it necessary for a
poem to be read and understood by
‘anything but the eyes.” He took it upon
himself to ensure that his poetry
reached the ears, and he became
famous for his powerful readings.

Fifty years ago today, Thomas, the
renowned Welsh poet, fell into an alco-
hol-induced coma, ‘dying four days
later at the age of 39. With the anniver-
sary of his tragic death reaching such a
milestone, Welsh actor . Robert
Kingdom is in the process of celebrat-

ing Thomas’ life —— and his poetry —
in a one—man tribute presented by the
International Poetry Forum.

“Dylan Thomas: Return Journey”
is a dramatic program retracing‘ the life
of the poet who performed frequently
over BBC radio and at over 40 univer-
sities across the United States.
Kingdom is said to become Thomas in
this award—winning performance that
is now touring the country. His is an
attempt to breathe life into Thomas’
poetry; even in death this poet and his
art will not be silenced; it will not rest
idly on the page. ’

The tribute seems to be one

_Thomas himself would approve of,

being that it celebrates the musical
quality of his literary talents. He wrote
of language: “what the words stood
for, symbolized, orlmeant was of very
secondary importance — what mat-
tered was the very sound of them 
those words were, to me, as the notes
of bells, the sounds of musical instru-
ments, the noise of wind, sea, and rain,
the rattle of milk carts, the clapping of

hooves on cobbles, the ﬁngering of“

branches on a window pane.”

Of himself, Thomas wrote, “I hold
a beast, an angel, and a madman in me,
and my enquiry is as to their working,
and my problem is their subjugation
and victory, downthrow and upheaval,

and my effort is their self-expression.”
Wednesday, Pittsburgh will see if
Kingdom is able tobeckon the beast,
assemble the, angel and motion the
madman — if he is able to negotiate

the contest between insanity and_

eccentricity that so defined the genius
of Dylan Thomas. , \

“Dylan Thomas: Return._Joumey” will
take place_tonight at 8 p.m. as part of
the International Poetry Forum atthe
Carnegie Library Lecture Hall. For

The biggest question facing this

year’s men’s basketball team is sim-. ,

ple: how do you replace Brandin
Knight? '

Senior guard Julius:Page has-an<  I

answer, and it’s as simple as two
words —-—— with Carl. A

.A redshirt sophomore, Carl
Krauser spent last season as Knight’s
backup, watching and learning what it
takes to run the point in Pitt’s system
and lead a team. This year, Krauser
says he is ready.

“I’m more than comfortable with
taking over and being the starting
point guard of this team,” Krauser
said. “If I don’t lead them to a winning
game, they’re not going to trust me to
be a leader.”

Last season, Krauser came into
games to give Knight a breather and he
often excited the crowd with his ball-
handling and passing abilities, averag-
ing almost three assists per game to go
along with six points and three
rebounds.

Starting in the backcourt with
Krauser will be Page.

Page was named the Most
Outstanding Player at the Big East
Tournament and also earned All-Big
East third-team honors.

After leading the Panthers in scor-
ing last season, averaging 12.2 points
a game while grabbing 3.4 rebounds in
32.1 minutes last season, Page knows
that, this year, he needs to step up.

“I need to be on the court; it’s as
simple as that,” he said. “Somebody is
going to have to step up. I’m going to
do it, and I’m ready to do it.”

Completing the Panthers’ trio of

‘guards will be ﬁfth-year senior Jaron

Brown. Although he plays what is nor-
mally‘ considered the small forward
position, Brown is used as a guard in
the Panthers’ offense.

After leading . the Panthers in
rebounding during the 2001-2002 sea-
son, Brown, who was named to
CNNSI’s All-Glue team, spent most of
his time doing the little things on the
court that often times go unnoticed.
Last year, he averaged a career-best

10.7 points ’a game and finished sec- .

ond on the team in rebounding, grab-
bing five boards per contest. ,

The one hole that both Page and
Krauser realize needs to be filled is the
one that Krauser is leaving — the

backup_point guard.

“We need “to replace Carl more
than ‘anything. because Antonio
[Graves], our backup point guard,
doesn’t have the experience, and he
hasn’t been there like Carl has been
there,” Page said.

Graves, a freshman from
Mansfield. Senior High School in
Ohio, was . given a scholarship in
August after averaging 19.2 points and
3.1 assists ‘per game during his senior
year of high school.

Despite his inexperience, Krauser
feels that Graves will be able to step in
and contribute.

“The guy behind me really came

in and stepped up over the past,

months,” Krauser said about Graves.
“I think he’s a good player, a good

shooter, and he’s athletic. He’s a good ‘

quick learner. He’s going to be one of

the best players in the Big East confer-
ence in years to come.” I
Also . joining Graves as backups

are Yuri Demetris and walk-ons Carlo

Dorazio and Charles Small.

A redshirt junior, Demetris played
in 20 games last year, averaging 2.1
points and_ 6.7 minutes per game.
Dorazio, who is the only player in Pitt
history to wear No. 0, saw action in 10
gameslast season.

While expectations are not-as high
compared to last year’s squad, Page
knows that this team will be right there
with everyone else. 1

“I think it’s a real good team,” he
said. “As far as potential-wise and raw
talent, I think it’s a better team [than
last season], but nothing can replace

experience, and I think that’s some—_

thing we’re going to get as the season
goes on.”

Virginia Tech’s 31-7 upset of
then-No. 2-ranked Miami pulled
down the seemingly unstoppable
Hurricanes while putting Pitt in a

position to run away with the Big East

title.

But several major stops remain in
the Panthers’ schedule and the season
is far from over. Here are just a few
things that must happen for Pitt to
take the conference:

°Pitt can’t lose to Temple.

It seems like a sure thing. Temple
has yet to win in the Big East this sea-
son. Even on the road, the Panthers

SPO R   W EW

Having Brandon Miree off the
field certainly doesn’t help. But with
the introduction of a two-back system

Walker and Tim
Murphy, the
Panthers seem to be
stepping up to the
challenge. Much of
the season relies on
the efficiency of
Pitt’s contrasting
carriers.

Season can still reach expectations for Pitt football

already played Virginia Tech and
Miami. Pitt hasn’t. The rest of the sea-
son for the Mountaineers is light.‘ .

With the exception‘ of the
Panthers, they play only teams in the
lower half of the conference. Pitt
could win the Big East despite a loss
to West Virginia, but it’s not likely. To
avoid being sucked into a web of ties —
and roundabout record comparisons,
the Panthers need to come out on‘ top
on the road.

°“The Larry Fitzgerald Show” must
go on. Fitzgerald is and:will be —
barring injury — Pitt’s ‘major offen-‘
sive threat this season. The Panthers
should continue to look for him and

enough to attempt man coverage.

°Pitt needs Rod Rutherford to finish
strong. Last season against Miami,
the quarterback threwefor 150 yards
and ran for another 69. But most
Panther fans can more easily remem-

ber his costly fumble inside the 4

Miami 10-yard line and overthrown
pass to receiver Yogi Roth to /end the
game. To win the conference,
Rutherford will have to execute all
the way to the end zone down the
stretch.

°Pitt’s defense must focus on getting
off the field faster, any way possible.

Extended play for the Panthers’
defense creates wear—and-tear holes
on the field. Quicker -pressure on
opposing quarterbacks with a continu-
ing increase in the performance and
presence of Pitt’s secondary will force
more turnovers. Intertwined in that
principle, the Panther offense must
spend more time on the field and
work toward giving up as little field
position as possible.

°Most importantly, Pitt must beat the
big, two — Miami and Virginia Tech.

Panthers lose either or both of these
games. The only way to clinch a

T exploit any defensive package foolish .

' Everything else.becom'es moot if the ,

championship at this point, is to .

remain undefeated; And the most
obvious obstacles to that goal are the
Hokies and the Hurricanes. x
‘5Pitt has to capitalize on home-field
advantage. Last season, West Virginia

.made the short trip to Heinz Field,

and won. The Panthers cannot allow

the powerhouses‘ of the Big East‘ to

forget where they are. They must play
with furor, pride and might. Upsetting

nationally ranked teams is never easy,

but if the Panthers have a chance at —
all, it will be at home. '

Fresh groupofplayers

lookto fill frontcourt  

RYAN WALKER
_  Staff Writer ‘
Grabbing rebounds,’ taking
charges, running the floor and scor-

ing points are all things that first—.

year head coach Agnus Berenato
expects out of her young frontcourt
this year. ,

With no returning starters, these
women have a tough challenge
ahead of them.

Berenato is trying to transform
the way the forwards and centers
are used to playing.

She wants them to stop thinking
that post players are clunky and
start believing in their athletic abil-
ity. '

The players all seem to be buy-
ing into the system.

Sophomore center Bridget
Larkin said she" noticed bigchanges
from the very first time she met
coach Berenato. ,

“lt’s a lot more intense; it’s a lot
more different; it’s a lot better,”
Larkin said. “[Berenato] is a com-
pletely different type of coach than
the previous coach, and it’s for the
better.”

Larkin knows that the best way

to improve is with hard work.’

Although the drills are physically
exhausting, she feels that the harder
the team works, the better they’ll
be.

“We get drilled-constantly,”

Larkin ,said. “But it’s definitely
making us better. There’s no telling

where we’ll be in four to six weeks. ~

We just keep getting better and bet-
ter.”

The women’s frontcourt is made
up of forwards Jennifer Brown,
Aieshya Dixon, Latoya Kincaid,

Sheila Stufﬂet, Cheron Taylor, and

DanielleiTaylor. Theteam has two
centers in Larkin and Allisha

_ Morris.

Nobody in this year’s frontcourt
had much playing time last season,
but they know that for this team to
be successful, the frontcourt will
have to contribute, especially on
defense.

' “I think we hold down the fort,”
Morris said. “We’re the last line of
defense.” ‘ " A .

Berenato, says that inside the
paint is “the house” and it’s up to
the post players.-to protect.

‘fOur guards are the coaches on
the court,” Berenato said. “But in
the post, we’re the housekeepers,
and we have to take care of the
house. If anything slips by the

guards, then we’ve got to clean it ‘

up.” -
One aspect of the game the
women’s frontcourt has ‘been look-
ingto improve is its ability to run
the floor and ‘score more transition
baskets. Morris thinks that the team
has some post players who can
move and will look to capitalize on

. that. ‘

JOE MARCHILENA/SPORTS EDITOR

Guard Amy Kunich tries to drive to the basket during Pitt’s game against

Connecticut last year. ‘

, “We just need to focus on run-
ning the ﬂoor and rebounding, and
everything else will come,” Morris
said. * ‘

Berenato feels that the athletic

ability to run the ﬂoor is definitely
there, but sometimes the players
just hold on to the ball too long.
She wants her players to grab
rebounds and get the ball up the
court. ‘ A
’ “We want to be able to rebound
and run the floor,” Berenato said.

“I’m trying to teach them to take
the ball off the glass, take one or
two dribbles, then bust it out.”

The Lady -Panthers know they
have «a tall task ahead of them. The
team is Very young, but the team
has a strong and athletic frontcourt
as a foundation to build upon-

N Team chemistry ‘has
improved, and that is important to

Berenato. She preaches team close— I
ness, and thinks of her team as fam— 

ily. In time, it is that type of attitude

Tthat will build a winning program.

Kunich and Allen. look to lead Panthers’ backcourt

MATT SORTINO
Staff Writer

Agnus Berenato doesn’t care about the past
of Pitt women’s Basketball. The first-year head
coach is concerned with only one thing for her
Lady Panthers — the. future.

A year after finishing 12-16 overall, and
more importantly, 4-12 in the Big East, the
Panthers top three scorers are gone and Berenato
is left with just one player who averaged over
five points a game a year ago, junior guard Amy
Kunich.

Kunich, a Monroeville, Pa., native, averaged
6.9 points per game while being surrounded by
three 1,000 point career scorers. She was second
on the team in assists with 3.9 per contest but,
this year will have to become much more of a
scoring threat. ‘

“I have to step up and be the team leader. I
have to contribute more this year than last year
and still get my teammates my ball,” Kunich
said. . ~
Kunich will lead a backcourt that could have
up to six different players see action.

Shelia Stufflet is the lone senior and is listed
as a forward but can play guard as well.

Three sophomores and_ a true freshman round

out the rest of a very inexperienced group of ball A

handlers, all of whom averaged less than 12 min-
utes per game a year ago’. _

Shavon Earp, a sophomore from ‘Virginia,
could figure to be the wild card in the lineup this
year for the Panthers.

Earp sat out the squad’s first few scrimmages
before returning Monday and making an immedi-
ate impact.

“Shavon hasn’t been available so far this

year, but [Monday] she made a huge ‘difference,

 

' well.

a huge impact, right away,” Berenato said. “But ',

. then again, we didn’t have her until now.”

_ Competing with Earp for playing time will be "
fellow sophomores Jess Allen and Cheron Taylor. I
Allen averaged 4.6 points a game a year ago _

and is a threat from three—point range. Last year,
Allen shot a team-high 43 percent from beyond

the are, but will look to incorporate other parts of

her game this season.

“It will depend on a game-to-game situation, '

but if the shot is open, I’ll take the shot — but if 

I have to penetrate, I can_ do that too,” Allen said. J»
Taylor, like Stufﬂet, is listed as a forward but

State Player of the Year.

“Chris Taft is a good, tough player from
New York who jumps high, is real athletic,
blocks shots, and he’s a great scorer down
low,” Krauser said. . , . . .

. Freshman forward”Dante Milligan is from
New York, where he attended Trinity-Pawling
High School. As a senior, he averaged 16
points and 8.7 rebounds a game.

Forward Ed Turner, who redshirted and
traveled with the team his freshman year, will
also see action this season. He attended Tumer-
Carroll High School in Buffalo, ‘NY. — the
same high school thatvlulius Page went to‘.

At Turner-Carroll, Turner averaged 20

.points and nine rebounds per game as a senior.

He led. them to the city championship game in
both his junior and senior years.

Forward Levon Kendall also redshirted his
freshman year and travelediwith the team. He
went to—Kitsilano High School in Vancouver,
British Columbia, where, he averaged 23.2
points and 13 rebounds per game as a senior.
He was named First Team All-Canada in 2001.

“We’ll see all [five] of them being contrib-
utors, iftnot now, but in the future,” Dixon
said. . _

“I think we’re going to surprise a lot of
people,” Troutman said.

He feels the freshmen coming in are very
talented and are ready to step up to the chal-
lengespthis season will bring.

“I feel very comfortable with the big guys
down low,” Krauser added. “All thebig men
down there aregoing to be very impressive.
They are working hard everyday. They have

great post moves.”

“Toree has done a great job working with
the younger guys,” Dixon‘ said. -

Morris is also prepared to step up and play.
He played in every game last season, mostly
off the bench, recording 33 blocks and 90
rebounds. He scored 115 points in the limited
action he saw_ last season behind Lett and-
Zavackas.

“Toree is dunking and catching the ball real
well,” guard Jaron Brown said of what he’s
seen in‘ practice so far. _

Junior forward Mark McCarroll played in
19 games last season and scored 28 points and

recorded six assists. In limited action, 123

minutes of play, he pulled down 35 rebounds.

Troutman was number one in the nation
last year with‘-a .718 shooting percentage, and
his teammates have confidence in him getting
to the basket and scoring points.

“Chevy is a scoring machine,” Krauser
said. “He’s a magnet to the basket.’’_ 2

Troutman averaged 1.1 points and 5.1
rebounds.per game last season for Pitt. He was
named to Dick Vitale’s All-Rolaids Team as
one of the nation’s best sixth men, due to his
great relief. Troutman came off the bench in 28
games last season. .

“Chevy is‘Chevy,” Dixon said. “He just
continues to put up numbers and surprise peo-
ple.”

coach Jamie Dixon said about the
Big East. “It’s a tremendous accom-
plishment for our conference to add
i those teams. We are going to have,
by far, the best basketball conference
in the country.”

Of the 16 teams that "will make scene.
up the new Big East, six of them par-
ticipated in the NCAA Tournament,
while five made it to the National
‘Invitation Tournament. Pitt, Notre
Dame and UConn all advanced to the

16, while Syracuse and
Marquette advanced to the Final
Four in the NCAA Tournament.

The winner of both tournaments

crown, and St.

In Miami and

came from the Big East — the
Orangemen captured the NCAA
John’s defeated
Georgetown to win the NIT title.

As for football, things are not as-

Virginia Tech, the
Big East is losing teams that have
played in three of the last four

While Cincinnati and Louisville
have been to bowl games in recent,
years, neither is known for having a
prestigious football program. South
Floridaand ,UConn are both fairly
new to the -Division I—A football

The Big East will also expand in
all of its other sports as well, mean-
ing that Pitt will gain new opponents
in all of its other varsity sports.

1 “We’re very excited about it,”
Pitt baseball head coach Joe Jordano
said.‘ '“In particular, baseball-wise,
we are _a stronger conference today
than [we were] yesterday. The Big

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Big East football may have fewer top teams

East conference does not get the pub-
licity it deserves as a baseball con-
ference, I think, because we’re pre-
dominately a northeastern confer-
ence.” , ..

Both women’s basketball head
coach Agnus Berenato and women’s
soccer head coach Sue-Moy Chin
agreed that they are looking forward
to competing against their new con-
ference opponents.

“This gives us an opportunity to
play some different faces that nor-
mally would be non-conference,”
Berenato said. “We lose a couple of
teams that have gone to the

[Women’s NCAA] Tournament, but '
we add teams that have always gone —

to the tournament. It gives a couple
other teams the opportunity to get
into the league and take a punch.”

“It expands our geographic
region, so it will help us in recruit-
ing,” Chin added. “It adds selling
points for us. I’m excited about it.”

Jordano nevertheless admitted
that he. was sorry to see one of the
departing schools go.

“We’re 6-3 against Virginia Tech
in the last few years,” he said, “so
I’m sad to see them go.”
