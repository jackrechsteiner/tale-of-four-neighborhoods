meter, not to mention moving people with words.

_ . So when theartist, who was born Kris‘Parker,

said of the poetry he heard Saturday night, “this is

opening my eyes; it makes me want to rewrite my

album,” it was the highest of praise. ~
Black Action Society’s~ Poetry Slamm II took

‘place at the Holiday Inn in Oakland, featuring a

multitude of poets volunteering to share their w.ork

While the event focused ‘on the sharing of

Chuck Jewart had to adjust his cowboy hat to get
a better look at what he was seeing in front of him.
The woman onstage had just thrown off a black
trench coat and black silky shirt to reveal a lavender
lace bra and mini, miniskirt.

Dancing on stage and removing layers of cloth-
ing in intervals, Jessica Shaffer, a sophomore
mechanical engineering major, was attempting to
raise the bids at the annual Engineering Student Date

THE PITT NEWS

NSP offers employment

BAS speaker focuses on fun,
self-respect and drinking water

LAUREN ‘BAN
Staff Writer

During “An Evening of Humor and
Humanity,” Dick Gregory, renowned
comedian, activist and nutritionist, spoke
Thursday night in the VV1lliam Pitt Union.

The event, sponsored by the Black
Action Society, ﬁlled almost every seat in
the Assembly Room with a truly enthused
audience. Upon arriving, many members
cheered, shouted and even hugged
Gregory. A

The evening started off with the
singing of the black national anthem, after
which Gregory began to speak.

Throughout the evening, the same
words reverberated in his speech. “How
long?” '

Gregory asked audience members
how long they planned to allow inequality
to reign or how long they’d let homeless-
ness and poverty continue to exist.

But not all of the subject matter was -

serious. Gregory joked throughout the
evening, poking fun at things such as air-
ports.
“They lose your bags, then act like
you never even had one. Then they ask
you if your bags have been with you all
day. Would a terrorist say no?” Gregory

said.

The 70-year-old Gregory, clearly con-
cerned with his own nutrition, also dis-
cussed respect for your body and how
important proper nutrition is. He stressed
how important it is to drink enough water.

“Geta nail and stick it in a bottle of
Coke. Come back in three days and it will
be gone,” Gregory said. «

And he stressed the power of the indi-
vidual as well. ,

“You can reach heights as long as you
believe it,” he said. “Have fun. Don’t be
all uptight. Be happy and enjoy yourse .”

Gregory concluded his show by com-
bining each aspect of his message into one
final sentence.

“You have the power, you have the A

force. Use it, take care of your body, be in
love with yourself, and, of course, drink
your water,” he said.

Gregory has taken part in many
marches, parades and fastings, many of
which were inspired by Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.

.More recently, he has protested at
CIA headquarters alleging that the CIA
supplied crack cocaine to black neighbor-
hoods in~Los Angeles. He has also started
a weight loss company and introduced a
diet program. A '

advice to poor, homeless

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
Staff Writer

David and Donna are married and have
three young children. Donna works 20 hours
a week at Giant Eagle as a cashier and David
is an unemployed machinist Two weeks ago

they were evicted from their home and now -

they live in a homeless shelter.

But they’re trying to get back on their
feet, and they took the ﬁrst step, Thursday
night when they met with members of Pitt’s
chapter of National "Student Partnership. To
protect their privacy and the privacy of oth-
ers who consulted the group, The Pitt News
has omitted their last names. _

NSP is a national organization located

on 25 college and university campuses all

over the United States. At Pitt, NSP is ser-
vice-oriented. Dave Westervelt, the co-direc-
tor of Pitt’s group, said that the members

seek out people “in. the community who ~
A really need-a hand up, who need jobs.” ‘

Thursday night,‘ nine of the 25 NSP
members got on a bus and headed
Downtown. At the ‘Salvation Army Shelter,
they met with two families and one single
woman. N SP members sat down individual-
ly withthese potential clients to describe the
services they could offer. ,

“We do anything that will help them get
a job,” Westervelt said.

Most of those seeking NSP’s help are
working, but they need more steady, better-
paying jobs. Some people were unemployed
for medical reasons and as a result have been

‘ ‘unable to afford to pay rent

Lisa is living in the shelter with her hus-
band and 2-year-old daughter. She is a certi-
ﬁed nursing assistant with 10 years of expe-

;_ rience. When she became pregnant, she left

her job and has not been able to ﬁnd steady

» work since. A week ago, she was evicted

from her apartment. After talking to NSP,

competitors, Luca Covi raised $42 by
taking off his lavender shirt, running
across the stage in purple velvet pants,
kissing both emcees and finally point-
ing to his nipple.

As the night wore on, audienc‘e
members became more familiar with
/those being auctioned. Shirts ﬂew off,

and ﬂashes of hips, cleavage and tat— I

toos were required if bids were to
break the $25 mark. Some of -those
being auctioned even bribed the audi-
ence with gifts of candy and condoms.

Some contestants were visibly
drunk. One woman needed two walls
and help from the two emcecs in order
to stay on her feet. _

One of the highest bids went to
freshman Kara Wagner. Wagner
appealed to Britney Spears fans as she
danced onstage to the song
“Centerfold” dressed as a naughty
schoolgirl.

At the end of the night the highest '

bid went to the tag team of 19-year-old
sophomores Courtney Jungjohann and
Lindsey Jewart.

provocatively andlhope someone bids

on us,” said Jewart, Chuck Jewart’s'

cousin. Their provocative ‘dancing
worked and the two ﬁnally sold for
$130.

Though some female students
were extremely ﬂexible, most didnft
have to perform too much to get the
high bids. Walking up and down the
stage, lifting skirt edges and pulling V-
neck tops down to the limit worked
well enough for _them.

But male competitors were expect-
ed to make a little more effort if they
really wanted to get at least a $50 bid.
Gyrations and stripteases were the
norm among the big money perfor-
mances.

At the end of the night, auctionees
were generally happy with their per-
formances and looking forward to
meeting their dates. Mike Hamidi said
of hisplans for his date, “I’m just
gonna go out there and give 110 per-
cent and see what happens.”

Kamat‘ said the auction raised
about $1,500, so everyone walked
away happy, especially the bidders,
who, after someﬁerce bidding battles,
won their specially selected dates.

an oozing brown goo escapes my
lips,” said Borden, eliciting laughter
from some audience members and
silence from others.
Twenty-five-year—old Caira
Crystian, who said she intended to
return to school at Pitt this summer,
shared perhaps the most humorous
piece of the night. Her poem,

“Request for a Refund,” was a
~ _ scathing indictment ‘of indulgent rap

stars, which she said she wrote in
response to a concert she attended
that failed tolive up to her expecta-
tions. With lines like, “ ‘Cause you
could only score/With a typical
hoodrat whore/Who belongs in the
endless throngs/of groupies in
thongs,” Crystian drew laughter from
nearly everyone in theaudience. _
Another finalist, 28-year-old Jo
Smith, a singer and former Pitt stu-

b dent, said he had to adapt song lyrics

to spoken word for the evening. His
first poem was a series of introspec-
tive questions: “You ever hate the
devil, but couldn’t kill one? The mind
is a temple, but you could never build
one?” V »

In his second poem .of the

evening, he continued to critically
examine his life, saying, “I’m that
dirty glass, trying to get clean. But I
need a whole lot of Palmolive, you
know what I mean?”

A laughing KRS—One appreciated
the symbolism, saying, “That’s an
album cover —— just a dirty glass.’’

The judges decided that Crooks
was the evening’s best poet. Members
of the. Mind Boxing Alliance, who
entertained the audience before KRS-
One arrived, were awarded second
and third place.

she hopes to get help with her resume and
ﬁnd another job in a hospital. L

“[NSP] could help, but [1] probably
have to start with housing — you gottatake
one step at a time, you know,” she said.

David and Donna hope NSP will help
them ﬁnd steady jobs despite their medical
limitations. Donna has recently been diag-
nosed with diabetes and her doctor will not
let her work very much.

David was injured ﬁve years ago while
lifting heavy packages onto a crane. He said
thatinthepastyearshisbackhasbegtmto

_ deteriorate. Now he walks with the help of a

cane arid has trouble standing for long peri-

ods of time.

“Am I disabled enough to not work or '

to work?” David asked. “It changes from
doctor to doctor.” a

After NSP ﬁnished meeting with people
they headed back home to their dorms and
apartments. Westervelt was happy, and he
said that everyone seemed very responsive
despite the smaller than expected tumout.

“It’s good,” reassured Robyn Dincher,
NSP co-director. “You might not get a lot of
tumout, but you can’t let that deter you. If we
getjust one person — that’s our goal.”

NSP did get at least one person that
night. Lisa, the certiﬁed nursing assistant,
made an appointment to come to the group’s
Fifth Avenue ofﬁce to work on her resume.

Students of all backgrounds can
take part in Black History Month

February is loaded with opportu-
nities to celebrate. Valentine’s Day is
glorified annually as a monument to
love and Groundhog Day once
inspired its own major motion pic-
ture. But despite being dotted with
ﬂuffy holidays and historical birth-
days, many people take this month
very seriously. February is Black
History Month.

You don’t have to be black to get
caught up in the occasion. Everyone
is able to participate regardless of
race or creed. As a Pitt student, you
will never suffer from a lack of
opportunity.

V Throughout the school year, the
Black Action Society has lived up to
its name by being extremely active
on the Pitt campus. Among talent
shows,-poetry slams and other events,
they managed to bring hip-hop leg-
end KRS—One to the area twice this
school year. And given its special sig-
nificance to this organization,
February is particularly packed with
events.

Since this is the middle of the
shortest month of the year, now is the
time to consult the BAS calendar, get

involved and learn a thing or two
about black history. -

The calendars are posted all over
campus and they are equipped with
all the dates, times and locations of

‘BAS-sponsored activities, including
‘lectures, hip-hop performances, a

fashion show and the Black
Consciousness Bowl.
And BAS isn’t alone.

Organizations all over Pittsburgh

have scheduled events to commemo- .

rate this month. Churches, historical
societies, libraries and college orga-
nizations from _Pitt and neighboring
schools are all involved.

College is a time devoted to

learning and expanding your hori-'

zons. So, as college students, it is
important that we take advantage of
special opportunities like this.

Some white students may tend to
feel intimidated by activities that
focus ‘directly on black people and
black history, but this is unnecessary.
Groups like BAS go to great lengths
to make sure their events are accessi-
ble to all interested people and they
will speak as long as people are will-
ing to listen.

Greetings from the  
swipe-in fairy

Way back in freshman year, the
sign-in fairy sent me a $10 fine for
some crazy reason, like forgetting
to sign people out. No big

I haven.’ t seen one hobo sleeping in
a cardboard box in my hallway yet.
That’s impressive. When ‘I go to
sleep at night in my

deal, right? Well, to ‘make
sure that it, never hap-
pened again, I just decid-
ed that from then on I’d
sign in with fake names
and floors that didn’t
exist —— like Abe Lincoln ’
signing in Old Dir-ty _
Bastard on 20.5 or Aunt
Jemima signing in
Professor Frink on nega-

 

. Benjamin Rubin
Columnist

‘ Batman pajamas, I feel
safe.

Still, some ‘things

just piss me off anyway.

For example, when

signing someone in,

some guards will take

inspect it for about half
an hour. They’-ll look at
it from all sides, sniff it

tive two.

This seemed to work pretty well
since I didn’t have to bother signing
out anymore and I didn’t get any-
more stinking fines, both of which
suck. So as my mom would say,
“That shit’ is tight.”

Unfortunately, I became care-
less, and then caught. So like most
good things, my bitchslap to the
system came to a crashing end. I
received tongue lashings from two

guards and the resident director

spanked me -— but for totally differ-
ent reasons. _
" ' How in the hell did I get in trou-

ble? I’m a good kid. The’ last time I '

had problems with authority was at
11 years old when my dad yelled at
me for puking on the. dog. After
much soul-searching ' (whacking
off), I concluded that the sign-in
policy at Pitt was more annoying
than a coked—out Fran Dresher at
the movies.

Now don’t get me wrong, I like .

security guards. They do a good job.

like it’s food, bite it for

it’s a fakie. Then sometimes the
guard will go on to tell mehow to
spell my friend’s first name. Oh
really, you mean Jeremy is actually.
spelled “J—E-R-E-M-Y?” Get. out of
town. But slowdown — let’s start
with me. »

I know I’m supposed to swipe
every time, but when I’ve got eight
bags ofgroceries and a stack of
library books while I’m nursing a
frickin’ baby, that tends to be a bit
of a bother. You guys know me; LI
live here.‘ What do you think, I"ffi
gonna molest my roommate with

this banana? And so what if I do?

He’s my roommate.

When I asked one guard to buzz
me in, he pretended not to hear me,
and just stared straight forward
while I flailed around. Hey, you
can’t do that move — it’s reserved
exclusively for hot girls at parties

Brentin Mock is gone.

There, I said it. Now it’s out on
the table and we can move on. But
you know what?

Nobody misses him more than I
do.

Last semester, ‘Brentin was the
only black columnist at the paper
and I served as the only black news
writer. Despite only having met him
once, Brentin was a great columnist
and I deeply respected his views; I
was ecstatic when I applied to be a
columnist this semester because I
knew that, along with Brentin, my
presence would double the repre-
sentation of the black students on
campus. .

But that did not happen when he
did not reapply and it has caused me
nothing but sadness.

Brentin wrote a piece last
semester about why black students
should write for The Pitt News and
express their views. Well, I am
going to raise the bar and call for all
minorities to come write for the
papen

With Brentin’s absence and no

other black applicants for a colum-

nist or news writer, I have been
thrust into the position of being the
only black columnist, while remain-
ing the only minority news writer. I
am very grateful for the weekly
words of columnist Robbie Ali, who
helps add a splash of color and
diversity to the office. Still, his
years and experiences prevent him
from fully representing the under-

graduate Pitt students.

And that’s when it hit me
recently that not only am I left feel-
ing that I am the public image of

How can one fully understand a
position that they have not experi-
enced? A

Conversely, how can one learn

black students, but also
the unspoken representa-
tion of all of Pitt’s
minorities.

Why?

There are Asians on
campus, but they’re not
writing columns. There
are Middle—Eastern stu-
dents, but not up here

no one here to teach it to
them?

"My fight to teach

ly when the ones I am

for the news section.
There are Native

Americans, but again not up here.
And the list goes on.

There are so many students
from so many cultures with so many
views, yet only one voice speaks
out.

As I sit in the office typing
these words, the same white faces
walk by smiling at me and take their
seats in the tan cubicles, a sense of
loneliness still seems to wash over
me like it does everyday. It’s not

‘from the lack of conversation

between my co—workers and me,
because most know that I’m a peo-
ple person. But it is the cultural iso-
lation that is silently present, leav-
ing me to feel that I’m not always a
part of the gang.

I will admit that there is an
ignorance that is present in some
workers. It frustrates me beyond
belief, but I can hardly blame them.

That’s where Pitt’s
minority students play their biggest
role. By applying and writing for
the paper and getting their voice
heard by a widespread audience,
they help teach those who are
unaware and further educate those
who are.

I write from my observations of
the life that I have experienced, but
I cannot possibly do that for every
Pitt student’s life. I cannot write
about Ramadan and Eid. I am not. in
a position to fully experience those
traditions, nor am I fully educated
enough about their significance.
Just like it would be foolish for me
to write about the upcoming
Chinese.New Year — Oh look at the
pretty dragon! I don’t know why
he’s dancing through the crowd but
he sure looks happy.

That would not make sense. '

But I would love to see a

A heavy burdenpto bear: one Voicefor many

Chinese student come and write a
column telling me why that dragon
is dancing through the street and

‘educate me. Even if not about your

culture, just voicing your opinion
about any topic would be greatly
appreciated. The dedicated Pitt
News reader has seen the topics our
columnists write about, from"clean-
ing out the fridge to party girls
dressing like whores to, of course,
politics.

So why are people scared?

I know I sound brave now, but
honestly I was petrified to apply.
But thanks to my best friend Kate’s

threats of kicking my butt, I did not

chicken out.

This semester is spoken for, as
columnists have already been
selected. But the Perspectives staff
always accepts columns from stu-
dents who want to bring a new
viewpoint to a topic and the news
staff is accepting rolling applica-
tions for new staff writers. Though
it is a while away, remember these
options next semester.

What if Robbie does not come
back? Or what if I decide to not
return after the rest of these stress-
ful weeks play out? What will hap-
pen when I walk out of this office
for the last time in April? “

Whose voice will be heard then?

excited to see who will misinterp_ret

More lenient sign-in policy at

must replace current system

Rubin,page 6

who don’t want to dance with me.

I have to say that sign out by 2
a.m. crap only stokes the fire of my
hate even more. “My stars, Lulu,
how on God’s green, magical earth
did it become 1:55 a.m. already?
And here we are chatting about,
twiddling our thumblies as if it’s 12
in the p.m. The last time I was
awake at this devilish hour was the
night of my propitious birth.”

Now I see, the administration
thinks we’re a bunch of nerdy Brits!
Well, I won’t stand for that kind of
mockery. Really though, 2 a.m.? I
wake up at 2 a.m. Oh, and that
overnight form is really good  to
poop on!

Why do we have downtime any-
way? What the hell’s it good for?
Kemmone man, canju see I’m
dronk? It’s around those times that I

really‘ do need help spelling my
name.

What we need is a more lenient
sign-in policy. The solution:
Universal swiping -—— every Pitt card
works in every dorm, except maybe
in Holland where panty raids would
increase by 900 percent, which
some weirdoes would say is a bad
thing.

Call me crazy, but I know of
another city university that uses this
policy already — the Ivy League
beaut, the University of
Pennsylvania. Does Chancellor
Nordenberg think we’re too stupid
to do the same thing? Nordy, you
didn’t say that, did you? Oh, just
because you were voted
Pittsburgher of the year you think

.you can do anything you want. Well

lemme aks you this, lemme aks you
this — can you kick my ass?

Pitt dorms

that once students can swipe into
dorms they don’t live in the whole
world will go bonkers? “Holy crap,
we’re in Tower A now. Let’s run
around ‘Lavern and Shirley’ style!
 We’re gonna do it.” “I’ve never
felt so alive.”

Besides, with less signing in and
out, we can save some paper too, for
the good of our children (yeah,
that’s gettin’ you girls hot, ain’t it?
Mmm, I’m a sensitive man),
because our children are so very
precious. (You like that, doncha?
Lean in and lick my picture, you
fine piece of momma. Don’t worry,
ain’t nobody looking. Uncle Ben’s

, got your minute rice right here.)

Ben‘Rubin isn't really challenging

the chancellor to kick his ass. But‘
should the chancellor decide to take

him up on the offer, he can e-mail

New, young music acts start up in the
city all of the time, and some, if they are
lucky, receive a fan following and leave a
lasting impression on music listeners in
Pittsburgh. ,

One band that is working on building
that fan following is Aether. A four-man
band composed of local college students,
Aether is relatively brand new to the music
scene; they formed only last summer. But
don’t let the short amount of time together
fool you; every member of the band has
been playing music for the majority of their
young lives.

Now ﬁrlly blossomed and matured in
their talents, Aether has recorded and
released one self-titled album that they ﬁn-
ished in the fall, and they are currently work-
ing on ﬁnishing their second

Aether has a smooth rock sound with
the powerful lyrics of frontman Jon
Zebraskey, a Pitt student, backed by the
incredible guitar sounds of Jim Graff from

Carnegie Mellon University. Pitt student
Adam I-llavek plays bass and Duquesne
University student Ben Tryc plays hard-hit-

Alive performance provides a laid—back
atmosphere that the music deserves. The
band stays relaxed and enjoys what they are

doing. They possess excellent stage pres-

ence, and the crowd, mostly close ﬁiends of
the band members, sing along to ﬂie songs
that are hard not to love.

The band played several shows all over
the Pittsburgh area last semester, including a
jarn-packed Christmas show at Club Laga.
Recently they performed a free show at the
Nightspot, the lounge area of the Duquesne
Student Union. Tomorrow night, they play
an over 21 show at Nick’s Fat City, where
they hope to gain a little more exposure and
a lot more fans. If you haven’t reached that
magic age, keep listening for future all-ages
shows the band plans to play.

“We’ve only been together six months
and things have gradually been on the rise,”
Zebraskey sai “ and it seems to keep going
as the word continues to get out.”

As long as Aether continues to produce
the sounds that they have been putting out
thus far, there should be no reason why this

band shouldn’t gain exposure all over this

city, and possibly beyond

2 Dig out your pseudo—handmade clothes
and gather your neo-hippie pals for the

. Recipe, with guests Railroad Earth. These

bands’ rowdy, acoustic-based and whimsical
. melodies will have “Porch People’_’ -——— oth-
erwise known as Recipe fans — on their

feet. ‘ 1 . ’ »
The harmony of ' electric and acoustic

sional ﬂute give the Recipe their down-on-
tl1e—farm (or at least outskirts-of-suburbia)
chann, and the bass, drums and percussion
add enough bottom to provide the band’s
‘playful Appalachian roots/rock duality.
Their music is steeped in Americana and
toys with curious topics such as aliens, play-
ground bullies and the backs of cereal boxes.

The Recipe often accents their sets with '

guitars, mandolin, banjo, ﬁddle and occa-»

a rendition of the Fraggle Rock theme song,
a random Beatles favorite and “Happy
Birthday” for anyone in the house celebrat-
ing another year. And of course, the band has
been known to veer off into ﬂights of impro-
visational jarmning. While the friendly vibes
of their songs lend themselves easily to the
studio, they are best suited to the stage.
Much like your fake handmade clothes,
the Recipe’s sound has been criticized for
being pseudo—grassroots. Though it may be
true that theirmusic is a somewhat watered
down form of ‘bluegrass — which is even

radio-ready at times — they are, in fact, tal-
«~ ented musicians. They have managed to

meld the mass appealing with the original,
which is no small feat. .

If you still ﬁnd the Recipe’s pop sensi-
bility objectionable, and desire purer blue-
grass, Railroad Earth nicely ﬁlls this niche.
Their sound is more improvisational and
acoustic, and it’s obvious that they’ve been
perfecting it for quite some time.

Despite the fact they’re less radio-ready,
Railroad Earth still turns out catchy and

infectious rhythms. All this makes for a feel— .

good live show, which is what ﬂie Recipe
and Railroad Earth are best known for.

Easton: Even when looking at these sys-
tems side by side, it’s difficult to find a clear
winner, and in the end, it’s up to gamers to
decide which-system is best for them. Sony
and Microsoft , have both made excellent
offerings that are well deserving of your
gaming dollar. But from a financial bang-for-
your-buck point of view, the GameCube,
with_ its $199 price tag and Nintendo’s repu-
tation for excellent first party software,
comes in first. Sure, it doesn’t have a hard
drive, ‘built-in Ethernet or DVD playback, but

THE BEST PLACE FOR Pm" SPORTS NEWS

 

Madness is on
its Way to  
Pittsburgh  

 

Spears Vrzw

Brian Goldman .

At the beginning of the season,
the Pitt men’s basketball team slo-
gan was “Remember the run. Where
will you be for the next run?” The
slogan referred to Pitt’s run to the
championship game in last season
Big East Championship tournament.

Well, why ‘ask where you will be
for the next run when youcan live it
up now? With the, win yesterday at
the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, Pitt
all but locked up a first round bye in
the Big East Tournament, moved

6 into the nation’s elite 20 teams and
, solidified its spot in the NCAA

Tournament in March. , g
March will be Mad for the first
time in a while in Pittsburgh. But

» why is this year’s team so good?-

They don’t have a Troy Bell or a
Preston Shumpert to steal the media
spotlight at every game. It’s likely
that none of these guys will have his
number retired at Pitt. \ '

But what they do have is the
greatest weapon in any sport. AT-E-
A-Ml! _

It’s not often in today’s sports
world that one team actually plays
like a team. The Lakers are a two-

man show, while the Wizards are a

one-man show. Duke has’ two,
maybe three players, while

. Maryland has one all-star.

But the Panthers have eight or
nine go-toguys in a game. Brandin
Knight is obviously the leader. The
junior point guardleads the team in

scoring, assists and steals, but he is

as unselfish as any player on the
court, much like the rest of his team-
mates.

After struggling through a lack-
luster first half of basketball, Pitt
was able to battle back from a 14-
point deficit to defeat Syracuse for
the secondtime this season, 75-63.
The win was the Panthers first in the
Carrier Dome since March 2, 1997.

Brandin Knight led Pitt with 16
points and nine assists, as the
Panthers were able to overcome
their first half shooting woes to take
a 1 1/2—game lead in the Big East’s
West Division.

Despite trailing by double digits I

early in the second half, the
Panthers never lost their confidence
and received a much—needed lift
from their bench, which outscored
the Syracuse bench, 30-4.

The Panthers‘ swirmning team
retumed to Trees Pool on Saturday to ﬁn-
ish oﬂ its regular season dual meet sched-
ule. After incurring this season’s ﬁrst loss
last week, the squad might have had good
reason to take its frustrations out at the
Pittsburgh Invite.

VV1th weaker programs such as

Indiana University of Pennsylvania,

Slippery Rock, 'Grove City and Clarion
attending the event, the Panthers would
have carried a few sure wins under its belt
to the Big East tournament.

But the events were not about the
scores. This much was obvious by glanc-
ing at coach Chuck Knoles’ watered down
lineup, which was aimed at accomplishing
goals reserved for this late in the season.

At one point, Knoles laughed when
asked how the score sheet read for his

1 2. a_. -§:q.n).:9_.b,.";;~._,..,,,_. , »,=‘.»..‘.1,,.::_-.a_.s Va...‘ 3., .» _- ., ._. , , .. . ,

‘The meet was indeed a practice
meet,” Knoles said. “It gave some of the
guys on the team who were not qualiﬁed
[for the Big East Championships] a
chance at making a qualifying time for the
meet.” . - ‘ ,

Two of the swimmers that Knoles
pointed out were junior Raymond Brush

and freshman Steven Kilroy. Brush swam,
his in-season best time for the 200-meter

freestyle, while Kilroy was the surprise of
the meet by making the cut in the 50
freestyle.

_ But some of the Panthers took a
reﬂective take on yesterday’s meet. This

_ was the last time that the graduating

seniors would swim in a home" meet at

THE PITT NEWS

MATT MILOSZEWSK1
Staff Writer

With just less than 14 minutes to play,
Ontario Lett leapt up, grabbed a rebound and
attempted to capitalize and score, but was fouled
and no call was made.

Panthers’ head coach Ben Howland disagreed
with the call and argued his case to -the officials.
The officials did not like what Howland had to
say and hit him with a technical foul.

The technical foul-changed the face of the
game and inspired Pitt’s defense en route to a
75-63 victory yesterday at Syracuse. _

Following the call, Preston Shumpert
dropped both free throws and six more consecu-
tive points as the Panthers found themselves

down 14 points (47-33) with just 13 minutes to

play. . —
In the next 3 1/2 minutes, the Orangemen
were unable to score a point, while the Panthers

ran off a 12-0 run to cut the deficit to 47-45.

During the run, the Pitt defense completely shut
down the Orangemen and their leading scorer,
Preston Shumpert. » i ’ '

Howland’s decision to go with Chevron
Troutman down the stretch instead of Donatas
Zavackas proved to spark the Panthers.’ defense.
Troutman matched up with Shumpert and took
him out of the game. Troutman’s 6—foot—7-inch,
230-pound frame and his athletic ability most
likely made it difficult for Shumpert to get shots
off.

-   Defense leads to big win at the Carrier Dome

With Shumpert in check, Syracuse had to
rely on Shumpert’s, supporting cast to carry the
offensive load. ‘

But Syracuse" was not able to get anything
going toward the hoop and was forced to settle
for contested long ‘perimeter jump shots and sev-
eral difficult three-point attempts. »

The long distance attempts failegl and the
normally strong Panthers’ rebounding took over,
outrebounding Syracuse 21-11 in the second
half,‘which gave the team a 37-27 advantage for
the game. Pitt’s stifling defense and strong work
on glass led to 16-6 run that put the Panthers
ahead for good.

Brandin Knight‘ got the Pitt run started by
knocking down two consecutive three-pointers.
Page followed
Knight’s bombs, with a three-pointer of his own
and Knight continued the_surge as he hit a left-
handed layup. Troutman later capped the run
\.ith an emphatic slam-dunk off a Jaron Brown

"steal.

Later in the game, the Panthers’ defense dis-
played more of the same inspired play, including
a ‘ stretch with three straight Syracuse posses-
sions thatresulted in Panther steals (Pitt had

nine for -the game). . ’

The Panthers outscored Syracuse 48-28 in
the second half. Pitt proved that 13 minutes of
tough defense could overcome 27 minutes of
lackluster basketball. Syracuse connected on just
eight-of-26 field goal attempts in the second
half.

Pitt overcomes 14-point

deficit in win over ‘Cuse

Victory, page 15

Pitt head coach Ben Howland said
during his postgame radio show.
“Everybody contributed, we never
hung our heads and we kept fight-
1ng.” '

Jaron Brown chipped in with
nine points and nine rebounds.
Ontario Lett scored 12 points and
Chad Johnson added eight off the
bench for Pitt.

Despite shooting just eight-of-

20 from the field, Preston Shumpert _

led all scores with his 28 points,
which included an 11 for 11 perfor-
mance from the free-throw line.

“I was so excited after the game
— this is the first time I can remem-
ber being speechless,” Howland
said. ‘ ‘

Howland had every reason to be
speechless, as the Panthers looked
like they were headed towards their

' fifth loss of the season, after shoot-

ing 39 percent from the field in the
first half, while Syracuse connected‘
on 52 percent of its shots. -

Things looked even worse when
Lett was called for goaltending a
shot '-by Josh Pace, giving the
Orangemen a 14—point'lead with just
less than 13 minutes left in the
game. -

Pitt did not give up, as Johnson

I scored the Panthers’ next six points,

to pull Pitt to within eight, 47-39.
The Panthers continued to roll,
going on a 14-2 run, tying the game
at 49 on a tough layup by Chevon
Troutman. _. '
Troutman, who had six points
and seven rebounds, had his first
shot blocked. He was quickly sur-
rounded by four Orangemen under
thebasket, but instead of passing
the ball back out, Troutman went
right through them for the basket.
After a free throw by DeShaun
Williams, Lett converted a pass
from Knight, giving Pitt its first
lead since the four-minute mark of

the first half, 51-50.

“I thought we were more aggres-
sive in the second half and played

I really good defense,” Howland said

about his team’s turnaround. “I
knew the open shots would start to

‘ fall for us.”

It looked like Pitt was headed
for a great game shooting the ball,
as Knight started the scoring with a
deep three on Pitt’s first possession.

Williams answered for Syracuse,‘

driving through the lane for an easy

layup. ‘
Brown accounted for the

Panthers’ next two baskets, the first

on a layup and the second on a jump
shot just inside the foulline. Knight
assisted on both baskets.

The Orangemen came right
back, scoring the next seven points.
Craig Forth threw down a reverse
dunk and Shumpert followed it up
with a steal and finished off the play
with a dunk.

James Thues buried a wide-open
three to give Syracuse a 9-7 lead
with three minutes gone in the first
half.

Pitt was able to take an 11-9
lead on two free throws by Toree
Morris and a tip-in by Brown, but
the Orangemen responded with a
basket by Williams and an easy fast
break layup by Kueth Duany for a
15-11 lead.

Following a missed dunk by
Duany and a foul on Donatas
Zavackas,‘ Lett cut Syracuse’s lead
to one with a three-point play.

Stepping in front of Syracuse’s
Billy Celuck, Lett grabbed a pass by
Duany and drove the length of the
court for the dunk, getting fouled on
the way up. Lett made the free
throw and the Panthers trailed, 17-
16.

Syracuse wou1d_not let Pitt get
any closer, finishing the half with an
18-11 run and a 35-27 halftime lead.

“We didn’t defend well in the
first half and they were more
aggressive,” Howland said. “[In the
second half] we bec_ame the aggres-
sors. It all starts with Brandin
Knight.” ‘

While he was just five for 14

from the field, Knight led the

Panthers back with great defensive
play, slick passing and two enor-
mous threes that put Pitt up 58-52
with 4:56 left in the game.

Knight also had a lot of help
from his teammates.

Julius Page, who was quiet for

' most of the game, hit a three from

the corner to put Pitt up 63-56. V

With less than two minutes left,
Brown collected a steal and found
Troutman up ahead for a dunk.
Brown made another steal on
Syracuse’s next possession, this
time finding Page for the basket and
a foul.

Page made the free throw, giv-
ing Pitt a 75-61 lead and securing
the Panthers’ 21st win of the season.
Pitt is now 9-3 in the conference
and will travel to West Virginia on
Saturday.

“We played with a lot of intensi-
ty and a lot of heart,” Howland said.
“I can’t say it enough that these
guys are a team.” 1

captain Will Eden said. “Our team is
incredibly close, it is almost like 25 broth-

Senior Joshua Quinn echoed these
sentiments by focusing on his teammates
as a ﬁmction of his experience, rather than
the sport itself.

“In the end it is not going to be the
swimming that I miss,” Quinn said, who
came to the team as a walk-on four years
ago. “Instead, it will be the camaraderie

ﬁll his Big East Championship aspirations
as well, but Figueroa did not make the
qualiﬁcation time.

Exemplifying the solidarity of the
team that has been present all season long,
his teammates rallied around the positive
aspects of Figueroa’s experience as a
swimmer for the Panthers. His presence
was deemed invaluable.

“He is a very important person to the

, nnual

  gala

 

tine’s @419

team emotionally,” Knoles said, “and I
respect him a lot for the great human being
that he is.”

At the end of the day, the scores hard-
ly mattered to anyone anymore. While the
meet was a chance for some to polish up
for the Big East Championship, for others
it was a chance to make a cut.

Not everyone had the kind of day that
they had hoped for, but in the end the team
was as much together as it had been all
season. g

“I know for a fact that when I look
back on my time here, I really won’t care
how fast I swam,” Eden said. ‘.‘I’ll remem-
ber the friends I made.

Now’s the time  

to enjoy Pitt
basketball  

Column, page 15

Selﬂessness is the key attribute

to the team.’ Just look at Jaron .

Brown. _V V
Brown is not a huge scorer, but

hedoes all of the. little things; He‘

rebounds, gets steals and handles
the ball if needed to break a press.
Underneath the’ basket, Pitt
starts Toree Morris. Does anyone
know Morris only gets 4.7 points

per game? You’d think with a start-

ing center averaging less than five
points, you could never win. Wrong.
Ontario Lett comes off the bench

I to spark the team with his enthusias-

tic play, his great hustle and his
explosive rebounding.

Getting more and more playing I

time lately are Mark McCarroll and
Chevron Troutman. Troutman had
his. breakout game in Georgetown on
Jan. 26 and showed why he was a
great recruit two years ago.

He has been finishing. games
lately because he earned it, accord-

ing to Howland. Troutman scores.
.when needed and participates on

many offensive boards for Pitt.
McCarroll, on the other hand,

has hit a couple huge threes for the‘
Panthers in the last couple of games.
‘ While ‘Donatas Zavackas has ‘

been more of a quiet contributor
offensively this season, he has
pulled down many big offensive and
defensive boards.

And last, but not least, the most
improved player from a year ago is

Julius Page. Page has become the"

Panthers most exciting player. and
best defender..When he held Bell
scoreless in Chestnut Hill for the
first half, the whole, Big East was
put on alert. V

Page took good shots and scored
16 points per game in the-past six
games. He electrifies the crowd with
his magnificent ally-oops.

All in all, Pitt has rebounders, a
few scorers, stealers, assist men and
a great coach. Without one of these
weapons, Pitt would not be 21-4
overall 9-3 in the Big East and head-
ing to the NCAA Tournament.

‘So don’t remember the run or
hope you’ll be there for the next

' one. The run is happening now. Live

it up while you can! :

Brian Goldman is a staff writer for
The Pitt News and owes a great deal
of gratitude to Mike Hertz for teach-
ing him everything he knows about
life and sports.
