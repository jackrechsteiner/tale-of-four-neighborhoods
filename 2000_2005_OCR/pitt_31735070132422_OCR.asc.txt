Free T-shirts and advice
at College City Weekend

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

Some Pitt students spend their four—year stay in
Oakland only brieﬂy wandering off campus to attend
football games or to go to the bars of the city once
they are of age.

Unfortunately, few Pitt students and students
from other local colleges and universities decide to
remain in Pittsburgh after they receive their diplo-
mas.

‘Pittsburgh is an aging city. Not surprisingly,
Pittsburgh companies are looking for recent gradu-

ates from local ‘colleges to consider making
Pittsburgh their permanent home, instead of leaving
after graduation.

To get students acquainted with Downtown
Pittsburgh, the first College City Weekend was held
on Oct. 3 and 4. The event was a combination of a
concert, exposition and a festival. . .

American Eagle Outﬁtters, one of the event’s

main sponsors, has its corporate headquarters in '

Warrendale, Pa., only 20 minutes north of Pittsburgh.

“.[We want]. to help keep college students in
Pittsburgh. This gives, them a good reason to see the
city and stay here and seek“ employment,” said Tina
Henderson, a merchandise analyst for American
Eagle, about the company’s involvement in the
event.

“Research has shown that kids come to

W

  

Pittsburgh [for college]- and they never come
Downtown,” said Margaret Salvatora, senior. admin-
istrative secretary for the Pittsburgh Council on
Higher Education. ' t ‘

Forjthe weekend, there were booths filled with
pamphlets and freebiesfrom businesses aimed at col-
lege students. The American Eagle booth handed out
free T-shirts to women and hats to men in exchang-
ing for students filling out a short survey. a V

Another booth ' hosted ‘ by
YouCanDealWithIt.com, a debt consultation service
targeted at college students, passed out pamphlets
along with T-shirts, highlighters and Frisbees.

The College City Weekend had no lack of enter-.

tainment. Students could be bused to the North Shore
to watch the “Head of the Ohio” crew races, or pick

up a paddle themselves and race a dragon boat or
' paddle a kayak. C

Skateboarders honed their skills in between the

exhibit tents on Penn Avenue. . ' I

Students could purchase a $5 T-shirt,’ which

acted as a ticket to ‘different concert venues. The con-
certs featured avariety of artists andlocal bands such

as Tabula Rasa, The Yards, The 
Cabaret and Grand Buffet. '  A  "T

Students clean Oakland despite cold, future litterers

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Senior Staff Writer

Sarah Bingler, a sophomore, would
have stayed in bed Saturday morning if she
hadrr’t had something important to do for the
Oakland community.

She was one of the few people on the
rain-soaked streets of Oakland at 9 am.
Saturday for Pitt Project Oakland.

“We come and take, and make

[Oakland] dirty, and then leave for the sum-

mer,” Bingler said.

This year, B_ir1gler wanted to make a dif-
ference.

Despite the rain, Bingler decided to take

part, for the ﬁrst time, in Pitt Project
Oakland. .

Formerly know as the Pittsburgh
Project, the ninth armual Pitt Project Oakland
enlisted members of the Oakland communi-
ty to walk through the streets of North, South
and Central Oakland picking up» trash.
Volunteers were divided into groups and
assigned areas to clean up between 10 am.
and 1 pm

Bingler liked the idea of “actually phys-
ically cleaning up” to give back to Oakland.

Though Bingler realized that Fall Fest
and Saturday night parties might cause litter
to build up again, literally overnight, she

said, “It would be worse if we didn’t take

action now.”

And it may raise awareness among stu-
dents and make them think twice before
throwing a paper cup on the street, she said

Another volunteer was ‘ oped” into
participating by a friend.

“I’m going to kill him,” joked the vol-
unteer, Darin Roodman, wearing a big black
coat to ward off the bitter coldness of the
morning.

But in a more serious mood, he said'Pitt
Project Oakland was an important event.
Even though he lives in Shadyside,

he said, biting into a complimentary bagel
provided by the event’s planners.

Like Bingler, Roodman said he. would-
n’t have left his apartment if it had been any
other rainy, Saturday moming.

As a high school student. in San
Antonio, Texas, Roodman performed simi-
lar clean-up volunteer projects for his com-
munity. '

“It was never this cruddy out,” he said. A

“But it’s worth doing.”

In the beginning, only a small crowd of
about twenty people gathered on the patio
behind Posvar Hall, the meeting place for
Pitt Project Oakland

But by 9:30 am, the patio was packed
with hoodie—wearing students,‘ crowding
under the awning to seek refuge from the
rain. Weaving tlnough the crowd became
more difficult than crossing Bigelow
Boulevard during lunchtime traffic.

Sipping hot drinks from insulated cups
—— which were, of course, discarded in near-
by trashcans and rocking to the music of

50 Cent playing in the background, the stu- ,

dents created a dim roar as they made con-
versation with friends and strangers alike.
“Every time Itum around, crowds are
coming in,” said Kelly Hoffman, communi-
ty organizer of the Oakland Planning and

Development Corporation, which. helped.

Strident Volunteer Outreach and Student
Government Board organize Pitt Project
Oakland.

“I’m really happy we’re working with
Pitt,” Hoffman said.

' “Sometimes students get a bad reputa-
tion,” she said, adding that it’s good for
homeowners to see students helping the
community.

In an effort to keep students involved in

the community, OPDC is currently “kicking -

off’ an initiative called “Keep it Clean,
Oakland.” As the name suggests, OPDC
wants to develop programs to clean up

Oakland year—round, and not just once a ,

year, as Pitt Project Oakland does.
One such program is the “Adopt a

I Block” project, in which groups can “adopt”

streets in Oakland to clean once a month.
So far only  and one sorority
have adopted streets, but any group can
adopt a street Atwood and Semple streets
and Oakland and Meyran avenues have all
been adopted . _
At ﬁrst, Katelyn Miller, the Student
Volunteer Outreach coordinator for volun-
teer service projects, was concemed when
she found out Pitt Project Oakland was on
the same day as Fall Fest. She said she

. thought potential volunteers might go to Fall

Fest instead, but then she reasoned that peo-
ple could do both. ‘ ' ‘ ’

“I’m very pleased all of these people
showed up,” Miller said, adding ﬂrat she
hoped Pitt Project Oakland would get stu-
dents excited about other community service
events. .

Fall Fest bands play through  

rain, sun, wedding pictures

NIKKI SCHWAB
Staff Writer

The weather slowly improved as the day pro-
gressed, and so did the crowd size for Pitt’s
annual Fall Fest, sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council.

Saturday’s Fall Fest included live music,
with headliner American Hi—Fi, as well as novel-
ties like freaky photos and pumpkin painting.

The chilly weather and sporadic rain might
have deterred some students, but according to
PPC advisor Tom Misuracaﬁ 2,000 students
attended the event throughout the day, with 750
students coming to watch American Hi—Fi.

The two student opening acts were selected
by a panel of judges to perform. The groups, Ami
’n’ Shaloc and The Lights Ahead, won the PPC-
sponsored contest. ‘The Lights Ahead started
their set in one of Saturday’s shower bursts,
which lead the audience to take cover under the
William Pitt Union’s canopies. A

But by the end of the set, students were back
to watching the music from the middle of
Bigelow Boulevard. .

Mind Boxing Alliance, a group that hosts a
variety o-f hip—hop talents, also performed. The
group, composed of Pitt students-, has performed
at either the Fall Fest or the Bigelow Bash for

Aserisible way to sell basketball tickets

This year, student tickets for Pitt
basketball games will be much more
likely to end up in the hands of gen-
uine fans, and with less hassle than
last year. The new system is similar
to the one used at Athletics Director
Jeff Long’s former workplace,
University of Oklahoma.

On Wednesday, students can log
on to www.pi-ttsburghpanthers.com,
then enter their Pitt e-mails, the
numbers from their valid Pitt Ids,
and credit card numbers — let’s
hope the Web site can handle the
heavy traffic without crashing,
though. The first 1,400 to do so are
guaranteed to get tickets.

Tickets can then be picked up at
g the Petersen Events Center upon

successful swiping of a guaranteed
_student’s ID However, rather than
giving students the entire season’s
tickets at once, the b0); office will
give students tickets for the next
few games during a set pick-up
time, which is a window _of a couple
specific ‘days. The later. a student
picks up the tickets, the farther his
or her seating section will be from
the ﬂoor. a

If the student doesn’t pick the
tickets up, those tickets go intothe
pool that students can access for
single games. If, after two days,
those tickets haven’t been pur-

, chased, they then go on sale to the

general public.

Using student ID numbers will
allow for loyalty rewards -— those
who consistently buy tickets can
receive incentives or better guaran-
tees in the future. '

These precautions will prevent
students with dumb luck from wind-
ingrup with season tickets while die-
hard fans are left in the cold, and
will practically ensure rear ends in
seats. Reselling the tickets is a great
idea for two reasons. Rather than
‘simply being forfeited, unused stu-
dent tickets will be up for grabs,
giving fans who didn’t manage to
get guaranteed seating a shot at sup-
porting their team. It also means the
University can‘ double—dip, gaining
more money on resold, forfeited
student seats. It may not be much,
but it’s a safe bet the money will
come in handy at some point.

In addition to the reselling pos-
sibilities, the price forseason tick-
ets has gone up from $20 to $35.
Such an increase isn’t prohibitive
by any‘ m_eans — $35 for‘ 22 home

games is a bargain, to put it mildly ‘

—- but it will likely deter the type of
fan who’d buy a seat and miss
games for any little thing.

Kudos to Jeff Long fofbringing
a sane, streamlined system -to
replace the mess that student ticket-
ing once was. 8

Free State Project. The idea, first con-
ceived three years ago, is to convince
20,000 libertarians from across the coun-
try to move to a single state and use their
strength as a voting bloc to create a
Libertarian utopia.

Most states might see this as colo-
nization by gun-toting pot-
heads with gambling addic-

tions, but it seems that New
Hampshire is more than
happy to have them. While
the decision was still up in
the air, Republican Gov.
Craig Benson, told the liber-

 

ally pull this thing off. Granted, the liber-
tarians are hoping to move 20,000 people
— not a lot compared to the almost
570,000 people who voted in New
Hampshire in 2000, but let’s assume
they’re embraced by the community and
allowed to do whatever they want. Then
what? Will it serve as a model of liberty
for the world, as the libertarian party
hopes, or will it stumble and fall into a pit
of addiction and inequality?

Well, I don’t really know. Given a
libertarian tax environment, businesses
should ﬂock to the area and, given the
small populace and general
seclusion, it would appear
that if instituting an ideolog-
ically ideal society can work
anywhere, it would be New
Hampshire Then again, there
is the ever-present fact that
some, if not most, libertari-

tarians, “Come on up. We’d ans are kinda wacky.

love to have you.” Regardless of the result,
Accompanying the gov- the next few years in New

emor’s hospitality, there are will Mimon Hampshire should prove fas-

also institutionalized aspects Co,um,,is, cinating to watch. In the mid-

of New Hampshire govem- dle of New England, a small

merit that will ease the job of group of people is banding

creating a libertarian society. First of all,

there’s the clause in the state’s constitu-
tion specifying the people’s right to revo-
lution and secession: “Whenever the
ends of government are perverted, and
public liberty manifestly endangered,
and all other means of redress are inef-
fectual, the people may, and of right
ought to reform the old, or establish a
new government.”

New Hampshire also boasts the low-
est state and local tax burden in the coun-
try. And of course there’s the state motto,
“Live free or die.” I didn’t make that up.

So, wow, what does all this mean?
5,000 people are already signed up to
move and theyhope to hit the 20,000
mark in two. years. Combined with local
support, they may have a chance to actu-

together to really try to change some-
thing. They want to create a society
based on theory and principle. The world
hasn’t seen anything like that since the
rise of communism. That didn’t work out
too well. But, still, the effort is admirable,
even inspiring.

So, for the record, I’d like to place
my support behind Project Free State.
I’m not sure how things will go in New
Hampshire once it’s completed but I
think it’s great that at least one group in
America is going! beyond simply com-
plaining. about how things are in this
country and is actually trying to change
something by taking their own initiative.

Hungry for a sandwich and noshing on other tasty snacks

Dear Sex N’at: . .

I’ve been having casual sex with a female friend of
mine, and realized this would be the perfect opportuni-
‘ty to attempt the menage. At first mention, she shot
down the idea ﬂat out, but recently she gave her
approval of another female friend of mine. The friend is
my roommate’s ex, and she’s not too experimental.
Both these issues complicate the matter.
Should I continue pursuing the roommate’s
ex or try to get my girl to approve a differ-
ent third component?\I would appreciate
your advice, and I refuse to let the dream
die.
Seeking Sandwich

Dear Seeking:

By “the menage,” I’m going to charita-
bly assume you refer to the Holy Grail of
casual sexual conquest known as the
menage a trois, or, in common parlance, a
threesome. '

A casual sex partner you refer to as a friend is, truly,
a great bet for this rare and unusual sexual confection.
Her initial hesitancy is a bit disquieting, but she did later
bring it up, and

even suggested a likely third wheel.

What is troubling, though, is that your friend knows
the girl she suggested and is probably familiar with her
low freak—factor. So it’s possible that she suggested
someone she knew would say no to get you off _her back
without having to continue to ﬂatly refuse you.

And then there is the ex factor. How good a pal is
your roommate‘? Or, more practically, how long of a
lease have you two signed on to? Because, ex or no,
he’s not going to be thrilled with the idea of you boning

the girl in question.

I don’t think your friend is really up for a three-
some. I understand your refusal to let the dream die,
though —— a well-orchestrated threesome is an unforget-
table event. Alas, though, a threesome gone horribly
wrong is also unforgettable.

Give.up on your roommate’s ex. Ifyou can get your
friend-plus to agree to another lady ——
without you wheedling or nagging — then

date for one of the pieces of bread in your
sbught—after sandwich.

Dear Sex N’ag: ‘
I love oral sex. It’s most deﬁnitely one
of my favorite things in the entire world. I
really don’t have any problem going down
on any girl that I’m dating, and get almost
as much enjoyment out of pleasuring a girl
as they do from being on the receiving end.
However, I very rarely am reciprocated. Most of the
girls I’ve been with have no problem when I go down
on them, but shirk away at even the thought of doing the
same to me. It hasn’t really affected my love of oral sex,
but still, it would be ‘nice to get something in return
every once in a while. Any thoughts? What really is
most girls’ problem with blowjobs?

While I’m . asking... I’m always looking to
improve. Most of the girls I’ve been with have said that
the clitoral orgasms they get from oral sex are much bet-
ter than the vaginal.orgasms they get from normal sex.
Do you have any tips on improving their experience
from good 01’ regular sex?

Dear NOSH:

Oral sex is —— and should be considered by more
people — an art form. It’s discouraging how few people
take pride in theirtechnique. It seems that you do, so
you are steps ahead of most folks. Way to go.

You say you’ll go down on any girl you are dating.

If you are truly dating them, it shouldn’t be a problem.

to discuss it —— not in the bedroom. Bring it up when
you are removed from the emotions" and brain—chemical
insanity that sex brings with it.

Tell her you enjoy giving her oral pleasure. Ask
how your technique is. Showing concern for her needs
will put her in a great mindset to discuss yours.

After you’ve asked her —— and truly listened to her
answers — ask how she feels about giving you oral
pleasure. Don’t say “reciprocating” —. it {sounds too
much like she owes you, and that’s not the way to get
any.

You’ll likely find out what’s wrong. Maybe she’s
afraid she’s no good at it. Tell her you’d be glad to have
a tutorial. Maybe she’s afraid she’ll gag. Tell her she can
set the pace and the depth. Find out her concerns and
address them. Be gentle. Bend over backwards for her.

To improve clitoral stimulating during “good ole
regular sex,” you can touch her or have her touch her-
self. Try getting behind her for easy access. If you’re on
top, shift a bit up so that your pubic bone grinds against
her clitoris. Or give her oral sex, and as soon as she cli-
maxes, begin intercourse — preferably while she’s still

in the throes of the ecstasy you’ve provided.

Show business is so hollow.

An auspicious beginningto a long soap—opera career

Becoming a soap opera star was
never a life-long ambition of mine —
or even a minor thought — until I
noticed that an open casting call for
“soap opera stars” was being held
right here on our very own Pitt cam-
pus.

I decided that this was my big
chance.

I could be the biggest thing to
happen to the soap opera industry
since that one episode of that one
show in which Monica discovered that
Brad was having an affair with that
three-eyed midget who is the illegiti-
mate child of Kerry, the husband-
swapping black widow, who was
accused of cheating on Brad with
Stephen, who is the father of the
three-eyed midget, who is the father
of Brad — considering Stephen had to
patch up his relations with Stephanie
just as she awoke from a four—year
coma to find that she had cancer and
that Stephen was fathering illegitimate
children with Terry, Brooke, Julia and
Mariah, who had just broken up with
Brad to have illegitimate children with
Stephen.

I figured soap opera acting was

my niche, so I made the decision to go
to this open casting call, even though I
had no idea what an open casting call
was. Like Eminem says, “You only get
one shot. Do not miss your ’
chance to blow.” I» decided I
was going to blow like no
blower had ever blown
before.

I would have to choose
between going to the cast-
ing call or attending my
optional calculus recitation.
I decided to split the differ-

ence and slept in until noon, columnist resume like that,_I figured
thereby missing the recita- there was no way the . .
tion and making the casting soap opera industry could
call with minimal time to spare. rejectme. — ‘ A

Now, I should explain that there
really wasn’t any specification as to
what type of person they wanted, so I
figured some head in the casting
department was saying, “This show

needs a pasty, lanky, awkward, pock-H

marked white kid,” and I would be
there to deliver.
Upon arriving at the lounge, I took

my application’ and set my pen ablaze.

myself in the acting business. Then I
messed up on the date, so I had to get

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA

“I don’t have a five-year plan
like some actors do,” Jack Black said
during a conference call interview
promoting his new film “School of
Rock.” “I just do whatever the best
thing is at the time to do, and this
was by far the best script I’ve read —
for me, especially. I kind of follow
my nose, like the Fruit Loops tou-
can.”

This time around, Black’s nose
led him to the character of Dewey
Finn, a fledgling rocker who poses as
a substitute teacher in an upscale pri-
vate elementary school in order to
pay his bills. In the process, he dis-
covers’ that his class is full of hard-
rocking pre-teens. He decides to
mold them into a kick-ass band
called the School of Rock, andhave

for being an energetic maniac who is
quite parti_al to the F—bomb, thanks to
his roles in films like “High Fidelity”
and as one half of the band Tenacious
D. But this film provided a set full of
young, impressionable minds that
required take after take to get a scene
right, rather than adults who could
better handle Black’s intense person-
ality and a day’s shooting.

“You know, I couldn’t drop any“

ass bombs, but I had a good time. I
brought the hard rock,” Black said.
“I pulled it,” he says of his energy. “I
pullit deep within the mind of the
superfreak.” But, he adds, “I’m a
kid, too, but I’m a big fat one that
has — I’m kind of a Pied Piper.”
Perhaps an even greater depar-
~tu‘r_e for Black in this film is having

towstepj out of the supporting. actor

shadows and into the limelight of
..being acomedic leading, man. His
first foray into this. territory was
“Shallow -Hal,” a film that received

rmixedreaction. In “School"of Rock,” .

though, he makes ~ the transition
effortlessly and hilariously, despite
Black’s claim that it was the “hardest
part I ever played.”

“It was the biggest part,” Black
said. “I had the most to say in it, and
memorize, and also I had to rock,
too. And when you have that combi-
nation, it’s two separate stresses
because even though I didn’t write

all of the music in the movie, I felt
responsible for-all of it because I was
going to have to sing it. Yes, man,
I’ve never worked this hard.” S

Despite having to tone down his
personality and memorize more
lines, the film does afford Black
the "opportunity to revel onscreen
in perhaps his greatest passion:
music. Finn is a character, simi-
lar to Black’s Barry in “High
Fidelity,” that finds music to be
the greatest joy in life — he
plays, talks, writes, lives and
breathes music. Unlike Dewey
Finn, who is a connoisseur of all
things rock, Black finds pleasure
in more than just one genre of
music.

.-“My major music inﬂuences
are ABBA, what you ‘may call
Simon & Garfunkel and Black
Sabbath,” Black said, before
adding, “In high school I really
liked Urge Overkill and some
stuff I’m not going to tell you. I
also liked Bobby. McFerrin——-
don’t ask me why.” ‘

With such a passion for
music both on screen — Black
does all of his own performing in
the film with the exception of the
solos, which he “ventrilosolos”
-— and off, it would only figure that
he would find such success with a
film like “School of Rock.” But he’s
quick to credit screenwriter and co-
star Mike White for his success.

“It’s like Mike wrote this script,

\

 unreleased

' “Tenacious

and if the script was a car, it's likejhe
pulled‘ up in-a Ferrari that was built
for me,” Black said. “So I mean I got
in it and I was like, ‘I know how to
drive this thing. I know what I’m
going to do. I’m going to take it over
some bunny hops, and ,I’m going to
ﬂoor it, and push the nitro button
that you didn’t even know about
under the dash.’”

Where does Black go from
“School of Rock,” his best work
since “High Fidelity”? He has con-
tributed voice work to the as—yet—
animated film
“Sharkslayer” and he’s gearing up
for Tenacious D’s second coming.

Due for release November 24,
2003 is the D’s first DVD,
D: The Complete
Masterwork,” and hopefully by the
end of 2004, the D’s first movie,
“Tenacious D: In the Pick of
Destiny,” will hit theaters

“lt’s Tenacious D’s crowning
achievement. This is what everything
has been building towards, and this
time we’re going to rip it open, wide
open,” Black said. “You will learn
why we’re called Tenacious D, and
you don’t‘ know. There’s a bogus
story out there why we were actually
called that —— not the reason why. It’s
a true story behind the whole thing
including the dragons,
Sasquatches, the devils, all of it, all
of it true. I don’t care if you
believe.” -

We believe, Jack. We believe.

75-minute running time be less
embarrassing; it would probably be
easier to forgive the stiffness of Erica
Beeney’s screenplay; and the film’s
slapdash production qualities would-
n’t be so" glaring. ‘

The film would‘ have been better
off if all of us who watched this sea-
son of HBO’s “Project Greenlight”
hadn’t been privy to all of the film-
makers’ screw—ups. It’s distracting
when you know that it’s actually
night in that shot that’s supposed to
look like day, that that’s actually a
production van that wasn’t supposed
to drive through the shot, and that the
climactic group hug that never comes
was cut out because it was too
cheesy.

It also would also be better. off if ,

Miramax had given said filmmakers 'a
chance in hell ‘of making a decent
film. It’s a criticism that’s certainly
been made before, but the contest -—
the brainchild of the divine Matt
Damon and Ben Afﬂeck —. sets its
winners up with substantially less
time and money than most indepen-
dent filmmakers‘ who actually know
how to make a movie require. It sets
them up to fail" and, in the process,
casts them in a spectacularly catty,
high-tension reality show.‘

The incidental product of that
show, “Shaker Heights,” is the story
of Kelly Emswiler (Shia LaBeouf), a
jaded but likable teenage smart-ass
who’s got a few life lessons to learn.
He has to give up his obsession with
war, realize that Amy Smart (playing
Kelly’s friend’s sister, who’s engaged
to be married) is too old and hot for
him and finally forgive his father for
choosing drug addiction over'parent-
mg. I

Kelly’s war obsession is a shal-

. low version. of-’Haro1d’s death obses-

sion in “Harold and Maude” -— Kelly
drives a military Jeep instead of a
hearse and participates in battle reen-
actments instead of faking his own
death. His ambiguously depicted ren-
dezvous with Amy Smart’s character
is far-fetched and unearned by the
filmmakers. The storyline of Kelly’s

' conﬂict with his father is barely there

— HBO viewers know that the studio
pressured the filmmakers throughout

the editing process to boost the com-"
_edy and downplay the drama as much

as possible _—— and as a result, the film
lacks a center. A A

At least it’s better than the first
“Project Greenlight” birth, the insuf-
ferably weepy “Stolen Summer.”

The only one who survives is the
ultra-charismatic LaBeouf, who
we’re sure to see more of in the
future. This kid could have ‘debuted

Biography

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Editor in Chief

It’d be very easy for a fan to be disgusted about this
book, but what would be the point? i

“From geeks in short pants to multiplatinum
artists,” the back cover proclaims, ‘
“Barenaked Ladies are nothing less than a
phenomenon.” It’s a pretty accurate mea-

ing BNL is something it’s not.

Any fan of BNL’s music that’s not on
top—4O radio will probably read this page- V
turner and, after about 100 pages, look
quizzically at the ceiling because there’s
something missing. Describing the humor-
driven BNL as a “phenomenon” just seems
wrong somehow. This is a band that has
made its living by being nerds, the guys too
smartto be mainstream. How can they be
anything other than some Canadian guys
singing with incredible talent, humor and
tenderness, let alone a phenomenon?

Paul Myers, who knew the band from

gets the point across for a remarkably easy
read, blowing by entire years in a few
pages. The problem is that he’s just not as
funny as the Barenaked Ladies band mem-
bers. Most of his narration is unsatisfyingly
surface—level, fraught with exclamation
points and failed attempts at cleverness.
Predictably, the best parts are when the
band members tell stories with the same
candor and self-deprecating sensitivity that
make their songs so good.

_For example, one story revolves

Bedside Manor,” a track on their debut
album Gordon. Through a series of random
comments, we learn from band member
Tyler Stewart that every session .that ever
led to the track’s recording involved nudity.
By everyone. Including the sound guys. ‘
“I have the pictures of us naked,”
Stewart says, “We should publish them!

of ‘I’m naked!’ at the end of the track!” »
Even with Myers’ overpunctuation, he
can get his hands on, quotations like that
give real sense of what is so lovable about
the band. i
' I’m doing my best not to be that guy
that goes nuts about how’ one of his favorite
bands has sold out and forgotten their roots

think they have sold out —. their music is
every bit as good as it ever was — and a
large part of me desperately believes that
this book was not their idea.” And it’s not
awful, either.

The problem, really, is simple: Any  written
about the BarenakedlLadies needs to do next to Both-
ing to be entertaining. VV1th ﬁve intelligent, witty, tal-
ented, hilarious guys there, why do anything but let
them tell their own story? There need be no other per-
son present except for the purposes of organization and
directing the conversation. Yet, throughout the entire
course of the book, the exposition is ever-present, keep-
ing us from the pearls of dialogue that any fan knows
are lying just on the other side of the narrator.

Barenaked Ladies are not a phenomenon. They are
an excellent band with distinct personality and a good
story to tell. Sadly, it’s a story we never get from them.

Some Devil

Dave Matthews
RCA Records
<£ni‘ni‘r

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

_ For those reading this who have
been under a rock for the past few

 months 4 or maybe longer  let me
inform you that Dave Matthews has

released a solo album. . /
Yes, it is true, but don’t freak out.

This does not mean that the Dave"

Matthews Band is no more. Some
Devil, the debut solo album from
Dave Matthews, was a way to keep
his creative juices ﬂowing and give
the rest of the band a much-needed
-break from the studio.

The album is an arrangement of
13 new tracks from Matthews.- They

are songs that never rose t,_Q.}_;_the. top-

with the band, bu’t’1tlfat ‘Matthews
wanted to experiment with a little bit,
thusthe release of Some Devil.

To help record the album,
Matthews turned to some fellow
musicians, including guitar greats
Trey Anastasio of Phish and long-
time friend and guest guitarist Tim
Reynolds.

The first single released,
“Gravedigger,” is an intriguing track
that is a tale of souls" lost to the other
side. The chorus begs, “Gravedigger

.     SOME HEW. ,

  

when you dig my grave/Can you
make it shallow/So that I can feel the
rain.”

Interestingly enough, there are
two versions of thesong. One is a full
band version that rocks out and the
other is a hauntingly elegant acoustic
version.

The title track has a bluesy rock
feel,“ and Matthews acted as a one
man band, playing the electric guitar
and singing with both a dark, eerie
sound anda beautiful falsetto pitch.
He sings, “Some devil some angel has
got me,to the bones/You said always
and forever/Now I ‘will leave you
baby/You said always and forever/Is
such a long lonely time.”

Another highlight of the album is
the emotional folk lullaby “Baby.”
The song was recorded live with
Matthews playing the acoustic guitar
and the Seatllemusic String Quartet
members playingalong. '

“Baby it’s alright/Stop your cry-
ing now/Nothing is here to
stay/Everything has to begin and
end/The ship in the bottle won’t
sail/All we can do is dream that/The
wind will blow us across the

water/The ship in the bottle sets sail.”

Filled with songs about life,
death, love and agony, Some Devil
has a different feel’ from track to
track. Whether it is bluesy or soft as a
lullaby, rock or reggae, (every track
brings you to a different world: Dave
Matthews’ world.

Tickets to go on sale

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Always wanted to buy Pitt
basketball tickets in your under-
wear, but been worried about
being underdressed?

Now it’s possible, thanks to
the new system that the athletics
department has created to distrib-

ute student season tickets.

Gone are the long lines wind-
ing down from the Petersen
Events Center to Fifth Avenue.
Gone are the yellow wristbands
distributed at Midnight Madness.
Gone is the lottery.

“We realized that students
were not satisﬁed with the lottery
system, so we started looking at
various options,” Associate
Athletics Director for New
Business and Fan Development
Jim Earle said.

On Wednesday, tickets will
go on sale on the athletics depart-
ment’s Web site, www.pittsburgh-
panthers.com, for any current stu-
dent who wishes to ‘purchase

them. The first 1,400 students to

enter their Pitt e-mail address, Pitt.

ID Card number and a credit card
number will get season tickets.

“This will verify, that they are
a registered student,” Earle said.
“Old ID numbers won’t access
the system. This processes the
sale and transaction, and students
purchase the ticket right there.”

Last year, the athletics depart-
ment distributed numbered wrist-
bands to students before Midnight
Madness and selected. the winning
numbers the following day.

The original plan, a year ago,

was to sell 1,000 season tickets '

and reserve the rest for individual
sale.  unclaimed season tick-
ets were then sold to anyone will-
ing to camp out in the William Pitt
Union overnight. ,

But when the-‘student section
was not filled for the first few
games, more season tickets were
put on sale, but without any
armouncement from the athletics
department.

With a new system in place,

the athletics department hopes to
avoid any confusion this year.

“I think what the system does
is solves everybody’s concerns,”
Earle said. “It’s used at
Oklahoma, and [athletics direc-
tor] Jeff Long brought it in.”

After purchasing the tickets,
students will receive a credit to
every game on their IDs and then
have a series of pick—up dates to
get their tickets. According to
Earle, on each pick-up date, stu-

A dents will need to go to the Pete .

to have their ID swiped and will
receive tickets to the next two or
three games.

“This gives us an idea of how
many students are going to use
their tickets before that game,”
Earle said. “Then the unused
ones will go on sale to any stu-
dent.” ‘

Season-ticket holders will
have a couple of days to pick up
their tickets before they go on
sale to the rest of the student

Panthers fallto nationally ranked Fighting Irish

JIMMY JOHNSON

Staff Writer

Notre Dame scored early and ‘late to
defeat the Pitt men’s soccer team 2-0 on

Sunday.

The Fighting Irish recorded 13 shots,

forcing Pitt goalkeeper Justin Lowery to
make nine saves in the game. i

“This is a good team we played today,”
Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher said. The
Irish are ranked No. 4 in the Soccer America
poll, and have allowed only seven goals all
season. .

Notre Dame started the scoring in the
third minute of the game, when Irish mid-
fielder Chad Riley kicked the ball into play
on a corner kick. Kevin Goldthwaite used his
head to deﬂect the ball on Panther goalkeep-
er Justin Lowery. Irish forward Justin Detter
finished the header by kicking it over
Lowery and into the net. -

Soon after the goal, Notre Dame (7-1-3
Overall, 3-1-1 Big East) pressured the
Panthers (3-8-0, 1-4-0) again when defensemen
Kevin Richards kicked the ball from midfield to
Detter. Detter used his head to deﬂect the ball on
Lowery, who made the save.

Brian Madden kept the Irish from scoring a
goal when he made the save on a ball heading on

where Irish forward Tony Megna shot
the ball towards Lowery. Lowery used
his fist to punch the ball out of harm’s
way.

With twenty minutes to play in
,the first half, Panther midfielder Billy
Brush came close to knotting the score
at one. He had a clear shot at the Irish
goal, but when he shot the ball, it flew
just above the crossbar.

With a minute left in the first
half, Lowery received more help from
his teammates. Clay Haﬂich slid in to
make a_ save on a ball kicked on net.
Lowery again had made the initial save,
but he was out of position for the
rebound. .

The Irish offense continued to put
pressure on Pitt in the second half.

Penguins just
might be better
than expected

  
  

  
      
   

The first game of the Pittsburgh
Penguins’ X Generation is Friday, and
according to the ads, this is the season when
the “ice will burn.” V

‘ With all due respect to the Penguins

' ‘ public relations people,I think that the ice
burned underneath the skates of Mario
Lemieux, Kevin Stevens, Mark Recchi and
the rest of the 1990-91 Penguins team. But
that’s not to say the ice won’t burn this sea-
son, too.

In fact, it probably already is burning.
The venom spilling out of the mouths of the
various talking heads that clog the sports
talk radio and cable shows condemning the.
2003-04 Penguins season to failure is so
strong that the ice at the Civic — excuse
me, Mellon — Arena is not only burnt, but

_ the water that was once the ice is boiling.

It’s true that this Penguins season is
going to be one that Pittsburghers who
grew up with ‘the Stanley Cup Penguins
teams and those who jumped on the Pens
bandwagon between 1991 and 1999 aren’t
used to. VV1th the exception of Lernieux and
Martin Straka, there are no superstars left;
the rest are gonebecause of the piss-poor
economic conditions of the NHL that forces

small-market teams like the Penguins to cut«':

corners and operate on an all-too-small
budget. For those of you not too familiar
with hockey, it’s the same situation throw-
ing baseball into disarray and causing the
, Pirates to have 11‘ consecutive losing sea-
- sons. For those who endured the Penguins
from their ﬁrst season in the NHL until
1989, this is a retum to the good old days.
Still, the ice could burn. Lemieux is
back for what might be his last season —
let’s hope it’s not — and should play 70 or
more games. Straka will hopefully be
healthy enough to play more than a handful
of games. General manager Craig Patrick
will likely sign the Pens’ ﬁrst No. 1 draft
pick since Lemieux — exciting brick wall
of a goalie Marc-Andre Fleury —— to a con-
tract, and the roster is going to be ﬁlled with.

Hills credits family/for accomplishments

RYAN FALooN
Staff Writer

Sophomore forward Erin Hills
played for a variety of teams prior to
her landing on the Pitt women’s soc-
cer team. Her off-field experiences
as a youth consisted of moving from
one school to another, thus causing
her to come and go between a variety
of soccer teams.

But what went on off the field
has had a’ positive impact on ‘Hills’
life, making her the remarkable play-
er and person she is today. She cred-
its much of her success to her fami-

ly.
Hills’ father, John, has served in
the military throughout her life.
Because of the many duties and
responsibilities involved in his job,
Hills and her family were forced to
move around a lot, from city to city.
While she admits it to have been a
challenge growing up, Hills believes
traveling helped her and her family
create a uniquebond; she stresses
the value of having a close family in
her life.
“Coming from a close family, we
stick close together because we
move around a lot,” Hills said.

“Sometimes, you don’t get to keep in
touch with a lot of your friends, but
you always have your family there.”

Hills is appreciative of the sup-
port she receives from her family
and is thankful for the time they
spend with her, even when she is
miles away at school. Despite cur-
rently residing in Burke, Va., Hills’
parents continue to take the time to
travel to Pittsburgh to watch her
play. 9

“They come basically to every

‘home game,” she said. “It’s great.”

have a day or two to purchase the remain-
ing tickets. Then, if there are still some left
over, the tickets will be sold to the general
public.

According to Earle, this will make
certain that the section closest to the ﬂoor
will always be full of people. Last season,
when the student section was not full, the
general public was invited to move down

and ﬁll the seats. ~

“No ticket will go unused,” he said.
“It helps us in knowing how many stu-
dents are in the building, and we Won’t
have to ask the crowd to move down.”

Another change this year is the price
of the tickets. While individual game tick-
ets will remain at ﬁve dollars, the price of
season tickets has been increased to $35
from $20. »

“There are more home games this

year,” Earle said. “That price had not been
increased in a long time and [with 22
games] tickets would have been less than
a dollar per game.”

By raising the price, the athletics
department also hopes to weed out the stu-
dents who may not care as much about the
team. '

“At $20, a lot of people who didn’t

’ care bought the tickets anyways,”. Earle

added. “We don’t want to get the price too
high, but we want to make it so students
only buy the ticket to want to : see the
team.”

Earle also said that, the earlier stu-
dents pick up their tickets, the closer- to the
ﬂoor they will be.

“On the pick—up dates, we’re going to
give out the ﬂoor seats ﬁrst, then go to the
reserved seats‘ in the upper level,” he
added. “We want students all around the

‘ court, but we also want to make sure the

seats are ﬁlled.”

There is a trend in this outlook for the

season the Bucs reach .500.” “This will

If Lemieux gets injured, if the new
guys Patrick picked up in trades at the end
of last season don’t produce, if Fleury ca‘n’.t
be signed to an NHL contract, then this sea-
son will be no different than the last two: a
wash out

And that’s on top of the‘ obvious prob-
lems in the Penguins lineup that will make
this task of putting together a winning effort
all the more difﬁcult A porous defense will
be put on the ice, game in and game out, and
no one with the exception of Lemieux and
Straka are proven, consistent goal scorers.
The two goalies the Penguins have —
Sebastien Caron and Jean—Sebastien Aubin
—— are unproven and inconsistent, respec-
tively, and the Pens latest coach, former

The Irish tallied an insurance
goal at 71:49.

Richards moved the ball to mid-
fielder Greg Martin, who crossed it
to Riley. Riley kicked the ball
above Lowery, who jumped to make
the save, but the ball was kicked
high and out of his‘ reach. The ball
came down just below the crossbar
and traveled into the net.

The Panthers had two final
scoring chances to finish the game.
Panther midfielder Marco
Carrizales crossed the ball to mid-
fielder Jeffrey Tidd with six min-
utes left to play. Tidd fired the ball
on Irish goalkeeper Chris Sawyer,
who made the diving save.

The second scoring chance
came when Carrizales shot the ball
past Sawyer, who came out to chal-
lenge. The shot ﬂew over the cross-
bar and out of play. .

“We had three quality scoring
chances [in the game] that we did-

Sawyer only had to make two saves
to preserve the shutout for the Irish.

Competition with brother has helped Hills improve as a player

While the support of her parents‘

her 21-year-old brother, for his
inﬂuence on her involvement with
sports.

“My brother and I had this com-

Hills said, recalling her childhood.
“Whatever sport he did, I had to do
better. I definitely thank him for get-
ting me this far. Without the healthy

Hills’ battles with her brother
have noticeably helped her become
one of the premiere offensive threats
for the‘ Panthers thus far. In her
freshman season at Pitt, she finished
second on the team in goals scored
and third in points.

Already, at the start of this sea-
son, Hills has proven to be just as
successful. She is currently tied for
first on the team in points, with
seven, one more than she produced
in her entire freshman season.

Aside from soccer, Hills enjoys’

as fishing and hunting. At one point,

“I was in a 150-pound—and-under

mopped up on everyone else,” she
said, laughing about her experience.

When she’s not playing soccer or
other sports, Hills’ primary focus
rests on her studies. She is a history
major, hoping to one day become a
teacher. In addition, she is consider-
ing coaching_in the future, since she
has a strong desire to help children.

“I think I see myself coaching
more [than .playing],” she said. “It
would be nice to give back what I’ve
