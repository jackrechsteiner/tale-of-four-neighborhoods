shootings

Staff Writers

' A Pitt worker reported that his,‘
‘ maintenance van had been stolen yes-

terday morning at 1 a.m. He discov-
ered‘ it was missing from where it had

been parked outside of Benedum Hall.

' According to Detective Patrick
Moffatt of the Pittsburgh Police Maj or
Crimes Section, the driver left the
keys in the door, allowing free access
to the vehicle; ‘

' Later in the ‘morning, the Crafton
police department notified Pitt police
that the stolenvan was involved in

. .two,.._.-shootingsr in the Grafton and q

Beltzhoover sections of the city. "

At 3 a.m., a man was shot on West
Crafton Avenue at Belvidere Street,
and another was shot in the chest on
Warrington Avenue near the‘ South
Hills Junction 15 minutes later.

According to I the Allegheny
County police, the suspect fired at the
victims several times after requesting
directions to the South Side. t
1 The victims were taken to Mercy
Hospital, where they were both treat-

_ed for serious gunshot wounds. The

Beltzhoover victim is now in ‘stable
condition, while the Crafton victim is
-in critical condition.

The Allegheny County and

Crafton police departments-are work-

ing together with County Homicideito
investigate the shootings.
At this time, the police have no

leads and the assailant is still at large.

The suspect is described as a

. black man, clean-shaven with a dark-

colored cap-. The missing van is a Pitt

facilities management‘ 1995 Dodge

Caravan, unit -No. 630. It is painted
white with blue and gold stripes along

the side and has the University seal on

its door. 7 A - 1 V .
Because the vehicle was parked
on a side street and not in a University
parking lot, police are not planning on
making any s’ecurity'upgrades. ,
Anyone with information on the
vehicle or the shootings should con-
tact Pitt police at 624-2121 or the
AlleghenyVCounty police at 473-3000.

Pitt names new engineering clean

in MARIANNA GLUSHETS
, The Pitt News '‘

Eric Beckman’s major goal as asso-
ciate dean for research of Pitt’s school
of engineering is to increase the volume
of research as well as to promote visi-
bility of the school and the workdone
there. 3

Beckman, a professor of chemical
and petroleum engineering, has been
with the school for the past l1_ years. He
was named to the position on Sept. 1.

His new post as associate dean for
research is a position that has not been
filled in many years. The last person to

hold the, job was Gerald Holder, now
dean of the school of engineering.

“The administration felt that this,

position needed filling,” said Beckman,
who was extremely excited about tak-
ing on his.promotion.

Beckman, of Aspinwall, Pa., earned.

his undergraduate degree in chemical
engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1980, and
received his Ph.D. from the University
of Massachusetts eight years later.

“There is so much potential. here,
what I am trying to do is help the facul-
ty communicate better and market the

“What good is research if no one
ever knows about it?”

Beckman is. currently involved
with researching the use of carbon
dioxide as a raw material and its poten-
tial to replace other more traditional
solvents. ‘

“[Beckman] has been one of the
leading teachers and researchers in the
school during the past 11 years,”
,.Holder said in a University press
release.

“His drive and passion for his work
is contagious, and I’m confident he’ll
help us maintain the research excel-
lence that has made Pitt one of the top
engineering schools in the country.”

Pittsburgh should bring in p

the noise, not restrict it

Think football games, ﬁre-
works, sirens on ambulances.
Clearly, loudness is fun, exciting or
necessary. Particularly in a bustling
city such as Pittsburgh, one should
expect to ﬁnd a diverse audio land-
scape indicative of urban chaos.

But such raucousness is not
agreeable with all city dwellers. For
years residents of Mount
Washington as well as otherparts of
the city have been complaining of
loud noise, mostly from concerts
and festivals at IC Light
Amphitheatre. In response to these
complaints as well as gripes from
quiet types in‘ other parts of
Pittsburgh, City Councilman Alan
Hertzberg has proposed legislation
that would force outdoor venues
with city permits to keep noise lev-
els under 65 decibels during the day
and early evening and under 55
decibels after 10 p.m.

Such an ordinance would
deeply wound Pittsburgh’s cultural
and musical core. The majority of
music that sounds good playing
softly on your stereo sounds inﬁ-
nitely better when played live and
loud at an outdoor concert.

Restricting concerts at the IC
Light Amphitheatre to a 65 decibel

V limit seems particularly ridiculous.

Most of these affairs end at a decent
hour, usually around 11 pm., and
the majority of concerts are held on
the weekends. Furthermore, it
seems likely that most residents of
Mount Washington’s cushy homes
would be able to afford earplugs —
a cheap and surprisingly effective
solution to unwanted noise, highly:
preferable to complaining to the city
and attempting to ruin other peo-
ple’s ft1n. _ _
Such an ordinance would affect
not only the major concerts atthe
Amphitheatre but smaller outdoor
events such as the Summer Street

Spectacular in the South‘ Side and‘

the Shadyside Arts Festival as well.
Outdoor concerts are among the
most positive aspects of city life.
Who can object to dancing barefoot
under the sun or stars to good live

rnusic? There should be more of
these outdoor venues and if any-

thing, they should be louder.
We seem to have the right idea

in Oakland; All we need‘ are more

concerts in Schenley Park. As it is
now, helicopters, traffic, pep rallies
and chatty, expressive drunks keep
us up at night, intrigue us, entertain
us and constantly remind us of

where we are —— a city that is alive, ‘

animate and vocal.

Don’t believe me? Think about the way you
as an individual dress, the music you listen to, or
even your political persuasions. Do any of these

Most of them don’t even realize it occurs.

I - It’s never easy playing more than one role. Just think _'

about everyday life - you are a young adult, a student, a son
or a daughter, sometimes a worker, sometimes a kid. Most
people will have sympathy if your personality paths cross

a little, but if you’re playing multiple‘ roles professionally

and you constantly let the streams__ cross, a la
“Ghostbusters,” they might not let you slide ‘as easily.

.. ‘The Tlum of the Screw,” Jeﬂiey Hatcher’s rendition
of Henry James’ novella of the same name, is a good exam-
ple of why characters need to be completely ﬂushed out

/

before performing. In this A two—person adaptation,
the female character (Bryn Jameson) plays one role
— the governess. The male character (Robert C.T.
Steele) has to take on three —— four if you count the

year—o1d boy;  Grose, a busybody housekeep-
er; and the slightly sexual, slightly stem uncle.

The story is simple. A governess is hired to ‘take
care of the uncle’s niece and nephew way out in the
3 _ hinterlands of England. He desires no communica-
" tion, and gives full reign of theestate to the gov-
erness. When she arrives to take up her post, how-
ever, things quickly begin to disintegrate, not only
in her relations with her wards, but in the psyche of
the governess herself. A

ﬁolicking through an (imaginary) ﬁeld -—— no mat-
ter what her character is doing, you can be sure she
will never play the same role in a different produc-
tion. ’
While Jameson ﬂourishes in her circa—l872
British female role, trilling through her lines and
totally encompassing her character, Steele’s perfor-
manceultimately comes across as lackluster and
convoluted. Granted, he has to make character
changes with lightning speed, but for an actor with
as much experience as he hasunder his belt, this
shouldbeeasy. V
In the opening scenes Steele is supposed to go

blink of an eye, but all he did to show the audience

A ghost story is confusing in and of itself — especial-
ly if the haunters are only a ﬁgment of one cl'raracter’s
imagination. The audience is forced to suspend their reali-
ties just a little more for productions that deal with psycho-
logical drama, and they are asked for more than that in
“The Turn of the Screw” — not only must they believe in
ghosts, they also must strongly believe in the characteriza-
tional abilities of one actor. Fortunately enough for Steele,
he isworking opposite an actress that makes up for his mis-
takes.

Commercials are merely the tuming point; soundtracks
from musicals and movies have_ inﬂuenced me for years.

around the house for days; last winter “Magnolia” had me

into song. . ‘ -

Yes, I often wish for a soundtrack to accompany me
throughout the day.

I can hear it now. As I wake in the moming, The Beatles”
“A Day in the Life” motivates me to rise and dress. Aretha
Franklin accompanies me to class. At lunch, as my eyes meet
those of a handsome guy across the cafeteria, Madomra sere-
nades us. Going _out at night, “Stayin’ Alive” encourages me
as I walk the mean streets of Oakland. Falling asleep, the soft
tunes of J arnes Taylor play until I can no longer hear them (but
I know they’re still playing -— it’s my soundtrack).

Life by soundtrack would deﬁnitely be exhilarating. Of

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

- course, problems would be inevitable.

Would we only hear our personal soundtrack, everybody
else’s personal soundtrack or a giant collective subconscious
soundtrack? Can you imagine trying to study in silence while
your roommate’s favorite heavy metal band inspires him to
ﬁnish his General Writing assignment?

And should we all have to listen to each other’s sound-
tracks? We could ﬁnd ourselves soundtrack-less in the library,
immersed in study, only to be distracted by an emotional
moment between the random couple across the table as strains

. of “Let’s Get It On” ﬁll the third" ﬂoor reading room.

I’m sure the record industry would have something to say
about personal soundtracks as well. I can see the copyright
infringement lawsuits now.

I suppose my desire for a constant musical score ulti-

mately stems. from the allure of movies and the glamorous, -

although unrealistic, lives of people portrayed in ﬁlm. But if I
were to cross the border from boring selfto beautiful star, What
would I do for glamour?

So the next time you see me walking down Fifth Avenue
with a loopy grin on my face, just smile, walk past and ignore
the opening notes to “Respect” ’

  Notorious

“Almost Famous” I
Directed by Cameron
Crowe

tttt

OLIVER B. JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The drugged-out, tripping rock
star stands atop the roof, reveling at
the mass of his teen—age fans. In his
most truthful moment, he clears his
throat and says, “I dig the music...”

The sound of the blowing wind

is all you hear against the silent

crowd, who only seconds before
were yelling and screaming. Now
the mass of fans are only confused.

.The rock star looks at them once

again, but this times shouts, ‘Tm on
drugs!” The crowd erupts.

This was one of the many
scenes from “Almost Famous” that
drove me deeper into this wonder-
ful story, which is loosely based on
the teen life of the director,
Cameron _Crowe.

‘what is so

“Almost -

Famous” is the newest movie from
DreamWorks Studio, who only a
year ago with “American Beauty,”
dug deep inside the American
Dream and showed usits lament
while still allowing us to take in its
beauty.

“Almost A Famous” uses the
story of a young Rolling ‘Stone
journalist named . A *

show us

c o In -
p e l l i n g
about rock ‘n’
-roll. Wﬂliarn is a .
scruffy, 15-year-old child genius
who gets a surprise job with Rolling
Stone to follow around the up-and-
coming band Still Water.

This movie goes deep inside
the rebellious ‘70s pop culture. The
beautiful Kate Hudson is wonderful
in her portrayal of the legendary
“Band-Aid,” Penny Lane. The psy-
chedelic>Penny Lane serves as the
gatekeeper into this world of myths
and legends, showing William and

tell. But during the closing credits,
I started to think, does it even mat-

money — it’s about the art, and the
artist trying to express his views
through this great medium. Then as
quickly as the thought had come to
me, the fantasy was over and with
a smile on my face, I got up and
walked toward the door.

one of the most boring roads known
to man. To conquer the Turnpike is
no easy feat — it requires the per-

prefer cream soda) and a delec-

and match songs to fit your mood,
the weather and the time of day.
That’s why I get so excited when

the load of CDs that I have to cart
back and forth with me. Almost
Famous, the soundtrack from the
film of the same name, may just
have taken the place of the 20 discs
my CD travel case can hold.

the curves _of the highway better than

Isupov’s dream-like
pieces occupy the ﬁrst

icately on pedestals, these
porcelain sculptures appear as pthoughthey

Actually, the pieces are “pretty sturdy,”

C the gallery curator assured a rniddle-aged

man questioning the exhibit.

Isupov’s art is full of contradictions.
Like a dream, each of his pieces merges
and evolves into a contrasting element,
resulting in a three-dimensional paradox.
Snails become whales, which become
human faces, whose chins become torsos

element of the unexpected. They also all
pay vast attention to minute detail.

The intricacy of each piece in “Bridge

Volleyball team

serves up victory

FRAN AIELLO . X

Staff Writer

Before leaving for the Bulldog
Invitational in Asheville, N.C., on
Thursday, Pitt’s volleyball team
seemed confident that they would

C put together a good performance.

“We’re going to be crushing peo-
ple,” said junior middle hitter
Heather Haff. And crush people they
did. The Panthers returned from a
sweep of this weekend’s competition
without losing a game. '

The team enjoyed its second
tournament title this weekend com-
peting /against Loyola, North
Carolina A&T, Campbell and UNC-
Asheville. I

Each of the four matches ended.

at 3-0 for the Panthers, who played
excellent volleyball in their last tour-
nament before Big East competition
starts. 1

Pitt vs. Loyola
The match
thought by the players and coaches
to be the hardest of the four matches
Pitt played this weekend, ended, with
Loyola losing 6-15, 3-15 and 4-15.
Loyola dropped to 7-7 on the season
while Pitt extended its lfour-game,

winning streak. Stacy Renick had 107
kills ‘while Jen Nickels and Haff
chipped in with seven each. Marcia

Thiesen had 10 defensive digs and
can be held partially responsibleifor
Loyola’s attack percentage of —.69.
“There is no real star player,”-
said Pitt head coach Chris Beerman.

A penalty kick broke their hearts

Pitt struck first against Seton

Steelers. Almost, but not

Why is jai alai not

and Olympic sport?

Just when it seemed like foot-
ball in thecity of Pittsburgh could-
n’t get any worse, it did.

Yeah, the Steelers lost again, but
what else is new?-' Everyone knows

they are bad. No, not just bad, terri-

ble. I’m a Dolphins fan, but since

going to school here I’ve adopted

the Steelers asjmy second team, so
I’d like to see them do well.
I was extremely excited this

' summer when-I found out I. got tick-

ets to two games, one against Philly

and. one the next week against‘

Jacksonville. I’ve never been to an
NFL game before, so this is some-
thing I’m looking forward to.‘ I’ve

been to 17 major-league» baseball
stadiums but never to an NFl.,.game. .

Go figure.

I just hope thatwhen I fiiiallyv do -

get to go to a Steelers game, they

are not still searching for their first '

win of the season. ‘I
That would be
pretty pathetic.
Pathetic, but certain-
ly possible.

As for the
Panthers, sure they won
this weekend but they
looked almost as bad as the

 

quite. Their inability to hold
on to the football almost made
Rutgers look like a decent foot-
ball team, which everyone knows
they are not.

But enough football bashing,

"the topic has been ‘thoroughly

exhausted. For something complete-
ly different how about the
Olympics? Seems like every time I
turn them on I find either -boxing or
marathon running. Can we say bor-
ing? R

I think that jai alai should be
added as a new Olympic event. For
anyone who is not familiar with the
sport, it is a whole lot more enter-
taining thanwatching someone run
for two and a half hours.

It involves guys jumping on

walls and throwing a ball (called a

V ppelota) with a cesta, which is basi-

cally a basket strapped to their fore-
arm, while yelling things in a for-
eign language that no one can
understand. It doesn’t get much bet-
ter than that. ,
There used to be a player named

* Ari at the fronton (the building in

which jai alai is played) in Ocala,
Fla. Ari was not your typical small,

E agile player.‘ He weighed about 400

pounds" and was as lazy as they
come. And he was justlplain, terri-

ble. ,

Then there was Tim,.who was
not exactly a ‘small guy either.
Sometimes Tim and Ari would get
paired up for a doubles match.
Whoa.

Of course then the crowd had a
few choice words to say, and the
match was always comical. Comical
except for those dumb enough to
actually bet on the pair.

Ithink people would take inter-
est in the Olympics if such an event
was added. I can picture myself
screaming at the television and

saluting the players like I would if I .

were at the fronton. That would be

pretty wild.-Then again, maybe I’m

just mental. W

, One sport that never gets any
recognitionin columns is horse rac-
ing, and I’m assuming that’s
because no one cares. But I figured

I’d mention it anyway. .

have inherited his
ability to pick win-

“ Karen ners, I have come up
a ‘ with my own
Blelak method. I always
pick the gray horse.

Why, I don’t know, it’s just some-
thing that I have done for as long as

I can remember. Sometimes there is

no gray horse in the race, and in that
case I"m screwed. Then I have to.
rely on my skills. I look at the
names and pick one I like. Hey,
sometimes it works. V

OK, so now I probably seem
like a total ﬂake, but I’m really not.
I just thought it would be refreshing
to talk about something a little bit
different for once.

Returning to the normal, I still
think the Mets will win the National
League East. Tonight they start a

"series. with the Braves at Shea"

Stadium, and there will be three
phenomenal games. I hope John
Rocker plays in the game because
Mets fans are among the rudest and
most arrogant in the world, and they
will certainly give him a proper
welcome. .

Karen Bielak is a columnistfor The
Pitt News and thinks that Dan‘
Marino should come out of retire-
ment to play QB for the Steelers.

blocks and 23 digs only to lose to
Pitt by the scores of 9-15, 8-15 and

Beerman pointed out that this
win against Campbell brought this
year’s team to the standard set last
year. The 1999 team finished the sea-
son with ll wins, and this win
brought the 2000 team to 11-4. The
Camels, who took second in the tour-
