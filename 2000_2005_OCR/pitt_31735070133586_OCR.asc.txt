Health Fair gives students
doses of good advice

LAUREN BAN
Staff Writer

Students milling through Health Fair 2002
yesterday were treated to festive decorations,
tasty food and all the blood draws they‘ could
stand. ,

Decked in red, white and blue decor, the

-Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union

hosted booths ranging in subject from skin
care to drunk driving. It was clear that all the
booths had the same goal — to teach students
about health topics they might not normally
get the chance to find out about.

One popular booth, sponsored by the
American Automobile Association, allowed
students to test out “fatal vision goggles,”

. your vision,

which simulated how people see when they
drink. The students tried to pick up a pencil,
which many found was extremely difficult
with impaired vision.» _

“When you drink  the first thing to go is
” said Terri Rae Anthony, safet
adviser .for AAA. _ ;.

Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization
sponsored a booth aimed at teaching women
about issues. including the importance 
breast self-examinations, body image accep-
tance, cancer and tampon safety risks. Tl{_1e

Woman reports
sexual assault in
Bouquet Gardens

BRIAN LIBERATORE
Staff Writer

According to Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney, acquain-
tances of a non—student sexually assaulted her at her Bouquet
Gardens apartment Tuesday night.

The woman called Pitt police from an emergency phone
on Oakland Avenue at 10:45 p.m.

Delaney said pol.ice_ then escorted her to Magee-Womens
Hospital on Forbes Avenue. She was released later that night.

Police would not specify the precise nature of the assault,
but said that pending further investigation, the incident could
be classiﬁed as a rape.

“This was not a stranger walking the streets,” Delaney
said, referring to the perpetrators. “It was not a forced entry
[into Bouquet Gardens].” _ A

Delaney also said that police have identiﬁed three sus-
pects. The three men have not yet been charged but the inves-
tigation is ongoing.  .

According to Mary Koch Ruiz, coordinator of Pitt’s
Sexual Assault ‘Services, the incidentis characteristic of a
larger problem. ’ F - _ V ,

“The majority of sexual assaults are with ‘dates or
acquaintances,” Ruiz said, adding that the incident is unusu-
al only in that most sexual assaults occur off campus.

“It’s important to call the police,” Ruiz said. ,“Even if
you don’t plan to press charges.”

Pennsylvania is one of the least
financially accessible states for
higher education in the country.

This is according to__a_, recent
national study“ titled “Unequal
Opportunity: Disparities in College
Access Among the 50 States,”
which was conducted by the
Lumina Foundation for Education.

The study rated Pitt’-s Oakland
campus as unaffordable for depen-
dent, low—income students, as well
as for independent median-income

students. It found Pitt to be. afford-

“able to- dependent median-income

and independent low-income stu-

dents who use loans to pay their

tuition. ‘

LFE defined dependent students
as traditional college students
between the ages of 18 and 24 who
are dependent on their families. It
categorized students who are finan-
cially independent of their families
as being" nontraditional.

. Sara Murry-Plumer, the director
of communications for the-Lumina
Foundation, said the report used
state census data to define a low-
income, dependent student as hav-
ing parents with an annual income
of $23,510 or less. The study
defined median-income dependent

students as having parents with an V

annual income of $69,730 or less. It
defined independent — median-
income students as making $42,230
or less annually, and independent
low-income students as earning less
than $13,560 annually.

The study looked at more than
2,800 degree-granting colleges and
universities. According to Murry-
Plumer, it rated them in four differ-
ent categories based on “college
expenses and family resources
[and] on the extent to which feder-
al, state and institutional aid helps
meet financial need for specific
types of students.”

’ Suzanne McColloch, an associ-
ate director -in Pitt’s office ‘of
admissions and financial aid, said
that this school year her office dis-
tributed $15.2" million in financial
aid. That number does not include
state or federal aid, athletic scholar-
ships or any aid that is administered
through other offices or schools.
Additionally, McColloch said the
financial aid budgets are increased
annually based on tuition increases.

Taking into account all forms of

- assistance, she said her office esti-

mates that‘ 70 percent of Pitt under-
graduates receive some form of
financial aid. ‘ 
McColloch said she was famil-
iar with the Lumina Foundation
study, but “it was not something we

_spent a great deal of time analyz-
ing.” She also said that no specific &

actions have been taken to address
the report’s findings."

Students enjoy a traditional German meal at the Penn Brewery on the North
Side. SGB’s multicultural committee sponsored a trolley tour of Pittsburgh’s

ethnic eateries. -

Students hop on free food
bus for a diversity of meals

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

Thursday afternoon a trolley full of
eager Pitt students journeyed in search of
one thing: free food. What they got --
beside chicken . wings, sauerkraut and
tiramisu —— was a lesson in Pittsburgh his-
tory.

noon, two in the evening — made their

way through 12 communities, introducing

students to new ﬂavors and aromas.
Freshman Lauren ‘Hynicka was

amazed after tasting heavily spiced red .

beans at the Homewood—Brushton area
restaurant Ramsey’s II. , .

“I was surprised,” she said. “I usuall
don’t like beans, but these were really
good.” . -
Hynicka attended one leg of the free
culinary tour that encompassed three cui-

’ sine types. In addition to German and

Southern Italian, participants dined on
“home original recipe,” as John Brewer,
owner of Ramsey’s II, called his fare.

' ' Put on by the Urban Studies

. Association and sponsored by Student
v Government Board’s multicultural com-

mittee, this branch of the tour presented stu-
dents with a history behindthe food. This
program functioned as a lead-up to
Saturday’s SGB-sponsored Diversity
Conference.

Attendees listened attentively as tour
leader and Pitt senior Regina Stefanelli told
them about the neighborhoods and restau-
rants. -

“We. wanted to aim for ethnic diversity
as well as neighborhood diversity,” she
said.

Brewer, a life-long resident ‘of
Homewood, reinforced the connections
between community and cuisine. His
restaurant, situated .in the Greater
Pittsburgh Coliseum Complex, serves soul
food — traditional black and Southern
dishes.

Brewer identiﬁes this food  an intrin- _

sic part of the neighborhood culture.
“I’ve been to Indiana, Pa,” he said.

“It’s beautiful country, but there ain’t no

soul food there.”

prevalent among young women.

“Self-injury is something that’s
pushed under the table by a lot of
doctors,” CWO member Lizzie
Criswell said. “They act like it’s no
big deal, but it is — so it’s impor-
tant to be educated about it.”

CWO member Andrea DeChellis
stressed the importance of not push-
ing women’s health issues to the
side. . '
“Women’s issues tend to get put

I aside as not being important, but

they are,” she said.

homophobia,
Rainbow says

Posters, page .1

referred to a ban on blood donations from
members of the gay community.
Speaking on behalf of the Rainbow
Alliance, Sandra Telep, the group’s presi-
dent, called the ﬂiers themselves childish,
“but the sentiment is so widespread that
we can’t continue to ignore it.” T h — e
problem with ﬂie posters, Telep said, was
not the claims that the fratemity’s mem-
bers were gay, but that it attempted to use

’ homosexuality as a slight against the fra-

ternity. '

“[The ﬂier] assumes that homosexu-
ality is a bad thing,” Telep said. “It’s hard
to believe that such outdated ideas still
exist within our generation.”

According to Telep, the ﬂier is repre-
sentative of a more severe atmosphere of
homophobia-on campus. “This is just the

I - [case] that’s getting press.”

' In the past, Rainbow members have
had food and beer bottles thrown at them
and suffered verbal assaults as they
walked to and ﬁom classes, Telep said.

She added that more support from the
University’s administration, including the
creation of a resource center for gay, les-
bian, bisexual, transgender, queer and
questioning students, would help alleviate
the problems.

Alluding to Pitt’s slow progress with
regard to recent calls to extend insurance
beneﬁts to same-sex couples, Telep said,
“How can we expect to erase homophobia
within the general student body when the
administration doesn’t set the example?”-

SAE president Chris‘DeLuca did not
return a phone call placed by The Pitt
News last night. Representatives ﬁom
Pitt’s Interfratemity Council were also
unavailable for comment at press time.

One booth, sponsored by Family
Planning Research, through,Magee-
Womens Hospital, offered students
a hands-on approach. The game pre-
_sented'students with a situation such
as, “the condom breaks.” The stu-
dent then had to determine what
would be the best" thing to do to
decrease their risk of pregnancy and
sexually transmitted infections.

“We’re just trying to educate
[students] about the different meth-
ods of birth control, and what to do
in certain situations,” said Maria
Holovanism, an employee in the
booth.

Cholesterol, iron and blood
sugar screenings were also avail-
able. .
Students filled. out forms and
waited for their blood specimen to
be taken, which would later be sent
to a lab, where the results were com-
puted. Some students came to the
fair just for that reason.

“I wanted my cholesterol
checked, so that’s why I came,”
nursing student Gillian Kurtz said.
“The fair was absolutely great, there
was a lot more than I expected.”

A booth sponsored by the Pitt
police attracted many students as

explained that the purpose of the
police booth, which offered a
Breathalyzer demonstration, was to
educate students and hand out
brochures on the dangers of alcohol,
specifically drinking and driving.

Other booths addressed insom-
nia, stress management, dental care
and eating disorders.

Students helped themselves to
punch and popcorn throughout the
afternoon and signed upto win

. prizes, including zoo tickets, a room

at Holiday Inn and various gift cer-
tificates donated by retailers.

Ever wanted to show your appre-
ciation for a favorite professor, but
felt timid about telling him or her
about it? ' _

Most likely, you’re not alone. As
college students, we often have pro-
fessors who do something special for
us. Perhaps it’s that political science
professor from whom you learned
everything you ever needed to know.
Or perhaps it’s that calculus profes-
sor who made sure you would not
give up learning how to do that inte-
gral, even after 20 tries.

Now is the proper time to express
that appreciation. The Student
Government Board academic affairs

-committee is sponsoring the Faculty

Honor Roll. Forms are currently
available at SGB’s office, 639
William Pitt Union.

The form itself is rather simple:
You fill out the nominee’s name,
department, position and write a brief
paragraph describing the difference
this person has made in your life.

The academic affairs committee
wants students to “honor a faculty or
staff member that has made a differ-
ence in your life or that you feel has
gone above and beyond the call of
duty at the University of Pittsburgh.”

Just think about the effort
required to fill out this form. It’s very
little, isn’t it?

Although you only see these pro-
fessors for a few hours per week — if
that — they spend a great deal more
time preparing for each class, evalu-
ating your progress and setting aside
time to spend with individual stu-
dents. I - _

Compare all that to the amount of
time it would take you to fill out a
nomination form for your favorite
professor. -

The academic affairs committee
should be commended for reviving
this program. The Faculty Honor Roll
comes from the best judges of a pro-
fessor’s teaching ability: the stu-
dents. We’re the ones in whose lives
they make a difference.

By nominating someone for this
program, . you also send the
University administration a message

' that teaching does matter at a major

research institution. You show that
we do care about the quality of edu-
cation we receive‘ for our constantly
increasing tuition.

And most importantly, you show
that professor that his or her efforts
are noticed. -Too often teaching can
be a thankless job.

So don’t be afraid to show your
appreciation. Take a few minutes out
of your life to recognize someone
who has made a difference for you. It
won’t be in vain.

Homophobic ﬂier symptom
of larger campus problem

SANDRA TELEP
Newsmaker

Editor’s note; The following is submit-
ted by a student leader who plays a role

-in campus events. Newsmaker columns

appear periodically in The Pitt News.

III am extremely concerned by the
posters that were found on campus this
week. Although the ﬂier itself was an

immature act, it’s a reﬂection of a

prevalent problem on our campus.

While it is clear that homophobia is
present on Pitt’s campus, this ﬂier is
just one of many instances proving this.
It is hard for me to accept that prejudice
is so common. Actions like these are
unacceptable and organizations like the
Rainbow Alliance have been working
hard to promote understanding within
the student body. A

This job is made very difficult
when the administration will not set the
example. The'University of Pittsburgh
cannot claim to support the Gay,
Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and
Queer/Questioning (GLBTQ) commu-
nity when, instead of offering basic
resources such as employee same-sex
beneﬁts and student resource centers, it
offers us empty promises and stalling
tactics.

The ﬂier incident is proof that our
campus is in need of educational
resources to battle prejudice in all
underrepresented communities on cam-
pus. There is a clear demand for a

Sandra Télep is president of the Rainbow
Alliance.

Ioia

I-(<e‘. ’..'; ..
.-iiivtgta_‘i_.¢t-2¢4.«:..-..

GLBTQ Resource center, not to men-
tion the already promised Women’s
Resource Center. and African Heritage
Center.

Seven months ago, the University
put together a commission to determine
the plausibility of providing sa1ne—sex
health care beneﬁts to its employees. It
promised a decision six months from
last June. The University community-
has yet to be offered -any results from
this ineffective commission.

It is ridiculous to think the

‘University is making a proactive

attempt to curb homophobia on cam-
pus. Time after time, we see the
University ignores issues important to
my organization and community.
' Days after the unproductive com-
mission was instated, the University
named the Ballroom in the Masonic
Temple after a man who, in a deposi-
tion, claimed that homosexuals’ should
not work in childcare. J .W. Connolly is
a relic of darker times, but the feelings
he fostered at Pitt still linger to this day.
Homophobia is inexcusable in any
setting, but why are we surprised that

' childish incidents like this ﬂier exist?
_ We see this ﬂier and we are appalled. I

must ask the administration if they are
equally appalled? You have not

p responded to past homophobia. This

ﬂier must evoke a response.

If the University as whole will not ,

respond,'then how long will it be before
a more serious incident occurs’? What
happens when immature pranks turn
into violent attacks? The University is

. not prepared’ to battle homophobia, and

it refuses to prepare itself.

The adventures of Zelda: Lovin’ life with a rat

Is life without Fido getting you
down? Do you miss being lulled to sleep

by the sound of purring?

As college students, we ﬁnally get to

Zelda, like all rats, is nocturnal, so she
sleeps all day and doesn’t need to be
entertained while I’m at class.

Zelda and I met at a pet store when
she was a mere 12 weeks

live on our own without cur-
fews, lame rules or reminders
to eat our vegetables. For the
most part, this also means life
without pets. No dorms and
few apartments welcome
furry, ﬁnny, scaly or slimy
friends. For those of us who
value the companionship of

animals — sometimes more Melisa Meinz

than that of humans — this
poses a serious problem.

old. She and I spent hours
getting to know each other
and consequently, she rec-
ognizes me by scent. She
enjoys human company as
much as any dog or_ cat, and
she knows that peeing or
crapping on a person will
result in a quick trip back to
her cage.

Recently, I bought a big

If you are willing to lie,
sneak and get over an initially high
gross—out level, there is a solution: Try
living with a rat.

Rats have all the advantages of a dog
or cat, but they take up far less space and
time.

I live with a little lady named Zelda.
Her cage occupies a small comer_of my
closet. While the lease on my palatial
North Oakland digs speciﬁcally forbids
animals of any sort, Zelda and I get
around this just ﬁne.

She doesn’t bark. She doesn’t need
to be walked or litter—trained. If my land-
lord were to make a surprise visit, he
would have no reason to enter my closet.

sack of pistachios. I pre-
sented Zelda with three of the tightly
sealed nuts and got an example of just
how cannily intelligent she is. She
gnawed a hole in the shell of the first
one, resulting in a considerably dusty
mess. She eventually extracted the nut in
pieces. It seemed like more trouble than
it was worth.

Moving on to the second one, she
prodded around the split in the -shells
with her snout and front paws, ﬁnally
realizing there was a sort of hinge at the
bottom. She realized she didn’t have the
power to pull it apart after trying for a
while, so she ﬁnally bit the hinge part.

By the third nut, she was an old pro.

She located the hinge and with one pow-
erful nip, the shells fell neatly apart and
rewarded her with a salty green nut. All
subsequent pistachio shells were dis-
patched in a similarly efﬁcient manner.

Not only are rats smart, they like to
par—tay. Everyone knows pets need to
have fresh water available at all times,
but Zelda has other beverage needs.
Among the usual gang of hooligans
found at my place any given Thursday
night, Laser Malt Liquor is the forty of
choice. ‘

This is partially because a forty costs
$2 and partially because it is Zelda’s
favorite kind of beer. Unless someone
pours out a capful ‘ for her, she will
attempt to climb the sweaty surface of
the bottle on its way to someone’s

’mouth. Lest anyone be concerned about

her drinking habits, I have never seen

Zelda consume more than one full capful ~

a night. She knows her limits. .
Of course, there are drawbacks to
living with ‘any sort of animal. Rats are
nodifferent in this respect, Most rodents
have a keen -hoarding instinct. Since
Zelda generally has free run of my apart-
ment, any small bits of paper or food can
disappear at any time. Luckily, she is
quite consistent in her hiding spots. If I

it is under the blue chair in the living

This does lead to some interesting
decorating habits. Where do you keep

live with a rat, my guess is it’s not on top
of the refrigerator.

A word of caution, speciﬁcally to “

psychology students: Don’t get a lab rat.
Set them free in an act of gonzo animal

So, if you are willing to lie to land-

lose important papers and get over the
stigma of living with “vermin,” open
your heart to a fuzzy lil’ ratty. You’ll be
glad you did.

“Whenever you ’re near, I hear a symphony. ’ —- The Supremes

PAGE 10

My relationship with the 61C is
like an ugly dress with sentimental
value. It’s rarely on time and often
overcrowded, but it does take me to
some of my favorite places in the
city.
Well, maybe it’s not quite like a
dress of any kind at all, but because
I spend so much time on it, I hate it
and love it at the same time.

One of the things I simultane-
ously hate and love about it is the

orquoi?

Leslie Hoffman

    

fact that at any time of day —— and I
mean any time of the day — there are always plenty of peo-
ple on that bus, and when you ride a certain route frequent-
ly, you start to recognize certain people.

For the past six months, I’ve noticed this girl not only
on the bus, but also at certain other locations throughout
Oakland and Squirrel Hill. _ p ‘

I won’t describe her too particularly because she’s a
college student who probably goes to either Pitt or Carnegie
Mellon — she has a Carnegie Mellon “look” about her,
though —— and I wouldn’t want anyone torrecognize her in
this column.

My friends and I see her pretty frequently. We’ve seen
her at the movies in Squirrel Hill, on the bus, in restaurants
and coffee shops and at the bowling alley. She’s quite easy
to notice; she’s rather different looking, and seems a bit like
a drama queen. For this reason, we have decided that we
inherently dislike her. We have also determined her name,
but for obvious reasons, I won’t relate that in the paper
either.

Recently, after having seen her for about the sixth or
seventh time in a coffee shop that I go to all the time, it
struck me that perhaps this girl is a bit like me: she obvi-
ously likes the samefilms and the same coffee shop, she
lives in a similar place and she doesn’t seem to spend her
weekends in a drunken stupor either.

It also struck me that perhaps she sees me and my
friends all the time and thinks, “There go those people
again  don’t they have anything better to do than what
I’m doing?” I imagine it’s possible that she, too, has figured
out superficial qualities of my personality, and knows my
name.

But then again, maybe not.

It’s funny, feeling like you know someone, but not real-
ly knowing her at all. .

I ‘saw her and two of her friends at a bowling alley last

weekend and I thought about introducing myself —— I mean, I

we see each other pretty frequently —— but I just couldn’t do
it. It seemed too weird. How do you introduce yourself to
someone you already know (or think you know)? And if, in
fact, she hasn’t ever noticed me and my friends, or even
worse, if she didn’t care, that would create a horribly awk-
ward situation.

How many people do you see habitually that you know,
but have never "talked to or know comparatively little ‘

about? Do you ever introduce yourself to them?

I’d like to introduce myself to this girl sometime, but I
think it may take awhile for this to happen.

Maybe I’ll talk to her the next time I see her on the 61C.

Pitt sophomore dances this weekend with Marvin  

Hamlisch and the Pittsburgh Symphony Pops

JEN MATsoN’
Staff Writer

When she was just a toddler, Lisa Zini

attracted crowds in grocery stores and malls by '

dancing while her mother shopped.

Now, at 19, the Pitt sophomore has traded
her impromptu performances for Broadway.

Zini gained the opportunity to perform on
Broadway by winning “Search for a Star,” a
talent contest sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Symphony Pops last January. Her rhythm tap
dancing A performance" impressed Marvin
Hamlisch, principal Pops conductor and the
conductor of the competition, so much thatshe
was chosen from more than 400 contestants.

In February 2001, she participated in the
Broadway _ production of “Fame the
Musical.” Although Broadway was a great

opportunity for the young dancer, a_ more
impressive performance occurs this weekend in
Pittsburgh.

Zini will perform with Hamlisch and the
Pittsburgh Symphony through this weekend at
Heinz Hall; the show opened last night. During

the show, she dances twice. -First, she taps in a '

traditional style to “Sing, Sing, Sing,” while
Hamlisch conducts. ‘

But in the second half of the performance,
Zini shows the audience how she won the
grand prize by performing a rhythm tap dance
without the orchestra’_s accompaniment. While
traditional tap dancing focuses on dancing to
the music, rhythm tap emphasizes making its
own.

“Rhythm tap is more modern,” Zini said.

Zini, page 11

Zini, page 10

“There’s no music. It’s funky; it’s
more street-kid type tap than old
Broadway tap.” Zini choreographed
both dances herself. _

To prepare for the Pops perfor-
mance, Zini has been practicing
every day. She rehearsed with
Hamlisch for the first time the eve of
the performance.

Before the performance, Zini
said she was doing “a lot”' of rehears-
ing on her own, in the effort to get
her endurance up. “It just gets harder
throughout the dance. I just go faster
and faster,” she said. .

In addition to rehearsing and

school, Zini teaches dance classes
once a week to students of all differ-
ent ages at Janet Hays and Co. Dance
Studio.

“I love to teach,” Zini said.

One day, she hopes to own her
own dance school. Because of this,
Zini is majoring in marketing and
would like to study elementary edu-
cation. For now, her attention is
focused on. her performance.

Honored to dance with Hamlisch,
who has won three Oscars, four
Grammys, two Emmys, a Tony, three
Golden Globe awards and the
Pulitzer Prize, Zini is quite excited;

“This is a great opportunity,” she
said. . A

Music for the people, by the

PNC Pittsburgh Symphony Pops
principal ' conductor Marvin
Hamlisch has made for this week-
end’s performance at Heinz Hall.

Opening yesterday for a four-
day run, -and aptly titled, “The
People’s Choice,” the concert is
the‘ brainchild of ‘ Hamlisch, who
began work on this project last
Year. '  P   I .

_ The "music for the concert was
selected from suggestions and
requests made via the symphony’s
Web site, or by ballots sent through
the mail. In addition, voters were
able to request a few artists from
last season, including “In Time”
jazz quartet, led by Pittsburgh
Symphony Principal Timpanist
Timothy Adams.

Hamlisch, whose compositions
can be found in the scores for
movies such as “Sophie’s Choice,”
“Ordinary People,” “The

Swimmer,” “Three Men! and a
Baby,” “Ice Castles,” “Take the

_Money and Run,” “Bananas” and

“Save the Tiger,” and who has
received two Emmys for his work
on-Barbara Streisand’s television
special, will be conducting the
Pops, in addition to the All-Star
College chorus, which features 100
students from 10 local colleges and
universities. .
Made up of more popular
songs, the program for the evening
opens with a bang
with Johann’ Strauss’ bombastic
Overture to Die Fledermaus and
includes a number of
popular Broadway hits such as

“‘There’s No Business Like Show

Business,” “Love is Here to Stay”
and “Climb Every Mountain.” The

‘middle of the program boasts a

tribute to Ray Charles, with the
symphony playing arrangements of
his best hits. The show wraps up
with the cataclysmic main theme
to Star Wars by John Williams.
Audience members will also be
treated to the tap stylings of local
dancer, and last year’s Search for a
Star winner, Pitt sophomore Lisa
Zini, who will tap her toes to clas-
sics like “Sing, Sing, Sing,” and “I
Got Rhythm.”

Tomorrow, 9:30 p.m.
Pittsburgh Deli Co.

VV1th spring break quickly approaching, many «stu-
dents will be taking road trips.

Of course, one of the essentials for any road trip is
appropriate traveling music and The Booda Velvets,
who are heading to the Pittsburgh Deli Co. tomorrow
night, can deliver tunes that are just right.

In a day when modern rock has become trite and
painfully unoriginal, forcing listeners to depend on acts
like U2 and Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Booda Velvets
make claim to their own niche with their newest
release, “Headrush.”

Three of the four band members, Dan Crornie
(lead vocalist, guitar), Jamie Balling (bass) and
Jonathan Yang (drums) met while attending school in
Philadelphia. .

The three moved to New York to continue their .

trade, where they met Adam Wolfe Lerner, who han-
dles the electric guitar and effects. Lerner plays a vital
role in diversifying the band’s sound with his effects
that are reminiscent "of Radiohead’s antics. .
What makes the CD such a great listen is the vari-
ation between songs, as the band goes from heavy bass
and Primus-like vocals on “American,” to the upbeat,

melodic, 2 minute, 30 second track, “Everything Goes ‘

Away.” It is this track that gives you the distinct under-
lying pop feeling, which grooves nicely with Cronrie’s
smooth vocals. ’

Following the Pittsburgh gig, the band will play the
House of Blues in Cambridge, Mass. a

One of the band’s more popular songs, according
to MP3.com, is “Cassius Clay,” which documents
MoharnmedAli’s “Rumble in the Jungle” ﬁght in Zaire
against George Foreman.

It was during this ﬁght in Africa that Ali shocked
spectators with his “Rope-a-Dope” style, thus defeat-
ing the bigger, stronger Foreman. Crornie expresses his
envy for Ali in this song singing, “You can put me
down, you can knock me down, but I’m gomra be like
Cassius Clay.” - « /

The hard-hitting song is preceded by “I-Ieadrush,”
a well-tuned song that delivers solid acoustic guitar
riffs, via Lemer and a soft-spoken Crornie that reminds
one of a cross between Bono and Michael Stipe.

The Booda Velvets deliver a strong showing with
the “Headrush” release and the band has received
strong reviews for their live performances throughout

trip, trek over to Shadyside to catch the band at the

Moth and rust

The Full Nine, with Moth
Tonight, 7 p.m. _ ,
Club Laga, $8, (412) 682-2050

Dust oﬁ yourdenim jacket, gel up your hair and head over to
Club Laga tonight for Mammoth recording artists The Full Nine.
This four-piece outﬁt from Toronto is setting out on their ﬁrst nation-
al tour with special guests Moth.

The Full Ninehad little trouble capturing the generic’ vintage
sound of the ‘70s that leave top 40 radio station DJs drooling.
Vocalist/guitarist Rob Langhans, sings “It hasn’t all been done.
Prove that it’s not over,” repeatedly throughout the chorus of “Not
Over,” featured on their ﬁrst full-length, self-titled album.

The only problem is, it has been done.

But he is right about one thing: it’s still not over. With radio sta-
tions all over the country waiting to play your “listener ﬁiendly rock”
that’s just perfect for that car trip to the mall with Mom, The Full

‘ Nine should have no problem drawing a crowd.

The group stays  the one-dimensional straight-beat,
straight-riif tempo that makes it easy for the listener to catch their

groove. Complimented by the chorus-verse—chon1s-verse styling of

the lyrics, they’ll have you singing along after your ﬁrst listen.

Apart from the occasional vocal hook or catchy guitar eifect, the
group struggles _to prove anything, except the fact that sticking with
previous fonnulas of rock is sure to draw some listeners. If you are
interested in hearing a .band that will offer more individuality, then
be sure to get to the show early for Moth.

Picture Tom Petty without the Heartbreakers or a straightfor-
ward version of Blind Melon with elements of electronica and
you’ve discovered the ﬁrst Moth-ball in your denim jacket.

Don’t  You may ﬁnd that this look of wacky lyrics and
oddball rock sound will suit you a little better than The Full Nine,
and the holes may become you. . '

Panthers lookig win against ‘Nova

JEREMY JESTER
Staff Writer

‘Think back to March 8, 2000.

Villanova had just defeated Pitt 65-55, knocking
them out of the Big East Tournament.

Freshmen Donatas Zavackas and Brandin Knight
were the only current Panthers on the roster. Knight,
who came off the bench, showed ﬂashes of future bril-
liance by leading Pitt with 17 points.

Who would have thought the Wildcats and
Panthers would not see each other for another 23
months?

Big East is split into two divisions and some teams
do not always face each other during the regular season.
That will change Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House.

Villanova ( 12-6 overall, 4-4 Big East) is on a two-
game winning streak after dispatching rival St. J oseph’s
102-73 and beating Big East cellar-dweller Virginia
Tech 84-77 on Wednesday. A ‘

Pitt, on the other hand, is coming off an 89-76 loss
on Wednesday to Notre Dame in which the Panthers
(18-4, 6-3) were trailing by 28 points at the half. The 89
points given up by No. 21-ranked Pitt was the most in
four years, when it allowed 96 in a double—overtime
loss against Villanova.

The two teams are alike in terms of age. Each is
mostly made up of lowerclassmen with Chad Johnson
as the Panthers’ only senior. The VV1ldcats have two
seniors, with center Brooks Sales the only one seeing

Julius Page, who has picked up his play in recent
games but was held to seven points by the Irish, will
look to make a difference against Villanova.

quality minutes. V

The battle along the glass will be interesting, as
each team takes pride in rebounding. While Sales and
Ricky Wright rank in the top 10 in the Big«East in

rebounds for Villanova, not one Panther even «breaks
into the top 15. Villanova and Pitt also rank No. 1 and
No. 2 respectively in the conference in rebounding mar-
gin

mg 49.2 percent from three-point territory. With 19.2
points per game, his scoring average ranks ﬁfth in the
conference. Pitt should take heed as the junior guard
leads the conference in free-thr_ow percentage with
91.5. .

Against Virginia Tech, Buchanan led the team with
20 points. He hit seven-of-11 shots while making six-
of-nine from behind the arc. Wright, the team’s second-
leading scorer, recorded a double-double with 11 points
and 11 rebounds. .

Knight led -the Panthers against the Irish with 20
points and seven assists. The junior point guard also
leads the conference with 6.8 assists per game.

Guard Julius Page, whose scoring increased the
past few games, took only seven shots, making three
for seven points.

Villanova coach Jay Wright’s squad heavily relies

’ on its shot-making ability, as it is second in the Big East

in ﬁeld goal percentage and ﬁrst in three-point percent-
age.‘ _ -

DON NGUYEN
The Pitt News

Men’s swimming head coach Chuck
Knoles felt conﬁdent about his team’s out-
look prior to the start of this season’s sched-
ule. After all, his squad was in the hunt for its
sixth consecutive Big East title with only one
swimmer lost to a team that has developed a
tradition of success.

Even with all the achievements over the
past ﬁve years, nothing could have prepared
Knoles for what his talented stable of swim-
mers demonstrated over the ﬁrst half of their
2002 season: complete domination.

The No. 18 Panthers (6-0 overall, 4-0
Big East) won 37 out of their ﬁrst 38 events.
On average, they beat their dual meet oppo-
nents by close to 100 points. For the season,
they possess Big East best times in 14 out of
a possible 22 events.

. “We are not going to slow down for the

. Big East conference,” Knoles said, “and

we’re not going to look bac ”

Looking back at the competition may
be harder than it sounds, considering the dis-
tance that the Panthers regularly put between
themselves and their opposition.

In the opening meet of the season, the
Panthers traveled to South Bend, Ind., to
compete in the 37th armual Notre Dame
Relays. -They swept all 11 relays while ﬁn-

ishing second only in the 3-meter diving-

event.

The Panthers captured the top spot with
234 points while beating the second place
Irish by 60.

The Panthers left the 37-year-old Notre
Dame Relays with seven different meet
records in their pockets. They broke the
records in two different 400-meter medley
relays, the 200-meter medley, the 800- and
1,000-meter freestyle and the 400-meter but-
terﬂy and backstroke.

First place to start the season was
impressive, but how they continued to win
was astounding.

After ﬁnishing ﬁrst at the Notre Dame
Relays, the Panthers won their next 25
events on route to beating St. Bonaventure
and Big East rival Syracuse by a combined
302 points. They were literally blowing their
opponents out of the water.

Against St. Bonaventure and Syracuse,
the Panthers ﬁnished with the best times in
every event, while holding both opposing

squads to less than 100 points combined.

_ ‘,‘It amazed me that we went through the
ﬁrst three competitions without losing a
relay event,” Knoles said. “I’ve been coach-
ing for 26 years and  has never happened
to me before, so it was a very good start to
the season.” '

'Ihat’s quite an understatement.
This was the kind of “very good start”

every ‘ Division I swimming coach could-

only dream of, let alone experience. _
With 12 juniors and seniors leading the
way, Knoles saw substantial contributions
from every part of the team Sophomores
Ken Shelhorse and Randy Gertenbach,
freshman Brian Bonczek and junior
Raymond Brush set the tone for the home
opener with a ﬁrst place time of 1 minute,
36.2 seconds in the 200-yard medley relay.
Later that day, sophomore standout Eric

_Limkemarm won the 500- and 1000-meter
freestyle events while senior Max Von_

Bodungen took the 200-meter freestyle and
100-meter butterﬂy events.

“It was our intention to make sure we
put the younger guys in a position to per-
form,” said Knoles, “because «the seniors
already knew they would have to perforrrr”

With his team’s expectations for the sea-
son clear, _the Panthers traveled to
Piscataway, N.J., to meet a surprisingly
resilient Rutgers team. The Panthers won
only seven of the 16 events that day, While
the Scarlet -Knights would at one point take

ﬁve straight.

The Panthers fought through j the
uncharted watersof adversity to win three in
a row and hold on for the last‘-two. Pitt beat
Rutgers by four points to stay undefeated.

Knoles saw this close meet as a wake-

up call not-only to his swirmners, but himself-

as well. . . .

“We had three competitions where we
completely roll over everybody and then we
have the ugliest win I’ve ever had as a coach‘
against Rutgers,” Knoles said. “This is the
learning point that falls on coaches of
Division I teams.” P

Instead of watching a great

matchup between the Steelers Matt Mﬂoszewski

and Rams, the rest of the

 

  

world and I have to watch a _

game with a 14-point favorite. (I mean the

Rams -14 for you non-gamblers out there)
The Patriots and head coach Bill

Belichick have done the greatest job using ~
_ smoke and mirrors to get this team to this

point. Honestly, I have seen the Patriots
play several times this season and they do
not belong on the same ﬁeld as the
Steelers, let alone the Rams.

What does this mean? Maybe the
Patriots are a team of destiny? Maybe Torn
Brady—bum ankle andall—is on his
way to completing a dream season?
Maybe Drew Bledsoe will step in again
and go from forgotten superstar to Super
Bowl MVP? Do I sound like I am starting
to believe this cliched garbage?

Unfortunately, I am. Then I think to

myself, how? I must ask, in what area do
the Patriots team appear to be better than
the Rams? There are actually 2 1/2 areas
that the Pats do appear to have the edge.
(Yes, I said a half) - _

‘ First, and most glaring, are special
teams. The Pats sent the Steelers and their
special teams coach packing with a Troy
Brown punt return for a touchdown and a
blocked ﬁeld goal, which was also
returned for a touchdown. (Insert all your
Kris Brown comments here). '

The Rams may have the team speed,
but not the edge in the special teams area.
For example, two weeks ago, the Rams
and Packers were playing in the divisional
round of the playoffs. The Rams just

"scored, taking it to 21-7 in the second

quarter and kicked off to the Packers,
when Allen Rossmn returned it for a
touchdown and brought the score to 21-14.

A questionable holding call brought
the score back, but if it had not, maybe the
Rams don’t walk all over the Packers and
Brett Favre has a chance to work his magic
instead of doing his Ty Detmer from week

onation. (Detmer had seven

interceptions and Favre threw
six). This is a small example
of how special teams could
turn the tides of this week-
end’s game and why I give
the edge to the Pats.

The second facet of the
game where the Pats seem to
have the edge is.the intangi-
bles. Most of you out there
are saying, “What is this guy
talking about?”

ifI can believe the other cliches, why not
this one, right? The Patriots seem to
believe in their coaching staff, their system
of winning and their ability to win, no mat-
ter what the odds against them. Can any-

body remember a team that was consid-

ered more of an underdog and a long shot
than this team?

Way back at the beginning of the sea-
son, potential Hall of Fame quarterback
Bledsoe went out with an injury that side-
lined him for two months. Did anyone not
write this team off after this and proceed to
bet against them?

Bodungen, the Panthers returned to the form
that made them dominant for the ﬁrst three
competitions of the season.

“Now that we’re this far through the
season,” Knoles said, “being able to stay
intense was not going to be an issue.”

As most Pitt students eased their way
back into class, the Panthers were preparing
for two important meets in the span of one
weelc West Virginia and a tn'—meet with
Villanova and Maryland ' '

With the meet against West Virginia, the
Panthers saw the return of last year’s Big
East Male Swimmer of the Year, Mike
Grube.

Grube suffered a knee injury before the
season began that kept him on the shelf until
the meet against the Mountaineers. True to
form and showing little rust, Grube made his
return to the lineup by breaking the West
Virginia Natatorium record for the 100-
meter freestyle with a time of 45.23.

Knoles enthusiastically welcomed
Grube back to the Panther lineup. -

“He’s our Antonio Bryant,” Knoles
said. “He’s that much better than everyone
else in the conference.”

Maryland and Big East rival Villanova
found out in a hurry.

. One week after conquering the
Mountaineers, the Panthers rudely greeted
Maryland and Villanova with 100-point
leads over each team by the end of the ﬁrst
day. The Panthers possessed all ﬁrst and sec-
ond place ﬁnishes in the ﬁrst nine events.

The Panthers would eventually win on
the strengths that generated success through-
out the ﬁrst half of the season: balance and
talent.

The No. 18 swimming team now enters

Virginia Tech on Saturday and Virginia on

defense matches up well against the

conferencein turnovers.

Pitt coach Ben Howland does have a
pleasant memory against ‘Villanova. On
Jan. 27, 2000, Pitt defeated the Wildcats
79-70 to give Howland his first Big East
victory as the Panthers’ head coach.

The game is also important for both
teams’ postseason hopes. The Panthers,
who are a half-game behind Syracuse for

2 Friday, February 1,2002

ﬁrst place in the Big East West, are look-
ing to obtain one of the first round byes
given to the top two teams in each divi-
sion.

Villanova, on theiother hand, is in
fourth place in the East division and still
hashopes of going beyond the confer-
ence tournament. A win against Pitt
would bolster its chances of getting into
the NCAA Tournament.

Tip-off is at 4 p.m. The game is sold
out, but Fox Sports Pittsburgh will
broadcast the game. '

Patriots have special teams edge

Column, page 15

I know I did, and I lost money. This
team has battled and rallied around Brady
and got to the biggest game of the season.
Since the Pats just seem to have that innate
ability to ﬁnd a way, they get the nod in the
intangibles department. ’ '

Then there is Belichick. There has not
been anyone out there who got more out _of
mediocre players like Belichick does since
Bill Parcells. The coaching edge in this
Super Bowl matchup would then go to
Belichick.

Well at least half of it does.
Belichick’s defensive schemes have bot-

tled up some of the NFL’s most effective
offensive weapons and they’ll be severely
tested on Sunday by offensive genius
Mike Martz. 

Although I just spent the last few
paragraphs trying to convince you and me
that the Patriots have a chance, I still like
the Rams. As John Madden says in his
video game series, “speed kills” and it will
on Sunday. The game will be closer than
expected, but still a Rarris victory.

' the landlords, and talk to the existing tenants when the
landlord is not there. To start you off on the “right” track,
call our number (24 hours) and leave your name and
-address (and your parents?) so that we may mail you
detailed information for your consideration.
