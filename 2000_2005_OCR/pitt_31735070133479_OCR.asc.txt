Pittsburgh corporate boards

A recent report says that women and blacks in

Pittsburgh have little access to positions in the _

highest levels of corporations. Though they make
upsizable portions of the Pittsburgh work force,
the boards -of ‘major employers and major non-

‘ profit organizations largely exclude them.

Pitt’s University Center for Social and Urban
Research issued a report entitled, “African-
American and Women Board Members in the
Pittsburgh Region.” UCSUR’s report, a follow-up
to one conducted in 1999, shows that while the
diversity of boards in the Pittsburgh region is

, improving, progress is slow.
UCSUR surveyed the Pittsburgh region’s top .

employers. Of the 50 corporations identiﬁed by
The Pittsburgh Business Times as the largest in

the area, 21 cooperated with the surve‘y.“Of‘thes_e

‘.‘ll,‘.'.,‘{-l,'\"",'\


21, almost -half have no -black’ board members.

Blacks comprise about 8 percent of the Pittsburgh .

region’s and 30 percent of the city’s work force.
( Study co-author Ralph Bangs thinks the com-
panies are doingenough. 9'

“Directors and boards don’t know African- ’

Americans or see the need to. include them or
make diversity a priority,” he said. . _

The study also showed that blacks hold
approximately 10 percent of board "positions in
Pittsburgh’s major economic development organi-
zations. These ‘organizations are “nonprofit
[groups that] help economic development in busi-
ness land development and business assistance for
job growth,” Bangs ‘said.

The study divides the 45 economic develop-

ment organizations examined into two categories_

Back again

Last year’s. referendum changed SGB’s
election cycle — should it change again?

‘ERIN BRACHLOW
Contributing Editor

After a-semester plagued by struggle, the Student Government

Board and its committees are looking for ways to refonn the sys-

tem. .,

The board members saw one of their problems coming. It
started with last ‘year’s referendurn,on which only 800 students
voted, that changed the beginning of the board’s one year terms
from December to.April.

According to SGB President J eff Alex, the referendum, which
was proposed by SGB’s Constitutional Review Committee, was
originally intended to align student govemment’s year with that of
the student organizations on campus and to give freshmen a better
opportunity to run for oﬂice. But now some members say the
change proved more damaging than helpﬁll.

' “I don’t know what they were thinking,” said board member

Kevin Washo of the CRC’s resolution. “It was not well thought-out

and they didn’t look at the repercussions.”

Because the board members were installed in April this year,
the necessary training and preparation that usually occurs was
postponed. And many of the elected members didn’t stay in
Pittsburgh during the summer months that immediately followed
the election. -

‘.‘People who run in April don’t even know _if they are going to
be able to stay over the summer,” said allocations committee chair
Jen Kolenda “A whole semester was wasted.”

But current board member Michele Agostini stands behind the
new cycle. Agostini said she  many of her colleagues
and thinks the current cycle gives students more time to learn about
SGB. ~

“It offers more students an opportunity to get involv ” she
said. “It also allows freslnnen to get more experience and more
motivation to run.” .

Agostini also said it is more realistic to keep this cycle because
many other schools nm on, it as well.

According ‘to Alex, SGB works during the summer because
the University’ is open and there are students taking classes. But
because there is no requirement for board members to stay at Pitt
during the summer, SGB lost a lot of time last summer.

“We lost all the summer months for training and advertising,”
he said. “It has hurt this organization as a whole.’’

Once the semester began in August,‘ Alex and the other newly

elected board members were faced with many jobs to do and no‘

time to do them. As a result, many other groups on campus were
alfected as well. "'

Forming the 11 committees and appointing their chairs was
the board’s biggest challenge and, according to Washo, the biggest
disappointment. ’

“It was a worst case scenario for us,” he said. “It was just a
mess.” _ ‘ i i

j Five weeks into the semester, there were still no committees
or chairs. The committees carry out much of the board’s agenda
and hold other important events on campus, which were all quick-

SGB considers changing election cycle again

Elections, page 1

1y passing them by in September. '

“Things didn’t stop running, but they
had been slowed down,” Alex said. “We
have not been able to run things as quickly
as we would have liked.”

The slow-down

The governmental relations comrr1it-
tee, which encountered the most difficulty
in appointing a chair, formed after this
year’s national Nov. 6 elections, which
eliminated a big part of its agenda.

“Since the GRC  formed late, noth-
ing concrete can really be done until next
semester,” said GRC chair Rogette Harris
said. “I would’ve liked to register people to
vote and to let the students know how
important the judicial elections were and
who was running.”

Although Washo said he is upset with
the delay in getting the committees started,
he feels the board dealt with it in the best
possible way.

“[The CRC] left us with our hands tied
behind our backs,” he said. ‘There was
nothing our board could do to expedite this
process any more than we did.”

Other campus events held early in the
semester were hurt by the delay as well.
Washo said that the annual Pittsburgh
Project was not well advertised or publi-
cized this year and blames it on the new

election cycle. He said if there were com-
munity relations or public relations com-
mittee. ''chairs in place, “we could have
excited the campus about it.” But instead,
few students responded. '

Some students may also miss out when
it comes to their organizations’ annual bud-
gets. One of the board’s jobs, according to
Alex, is to approve or deny groups’ annual
budgets in the spring of each year, based on
the recommendations of the allocations
committee. But with. the new election
cycle, the board makes its rulings in
February and then leaves in April.

“We have to approve armual budgets
that we’ll never see in practice,” Alex said.

To remedy these problems, the board
recently passed a resolution to set up a
committee that will look into possible
changes for the election year. According to
Washo, the committee needs to be “an
objective group of totally new people.” One
possible solution, he said, is to create an

interim board during the summer to “get the .

groundwork ready” for the incoming board
elected in April. Alex said that the resolu-
tion is “for the bettennent of the whole
organization.”

Allocations confusion ,
Although unrelated to the change in
the election cycle, the allocations comrnit-
tee has had its share of problems this
semester as well. Several student orgar1iza-

tions complained that the process of
requesting money from the committee is
unclear and discouraging to new clubs.
Monica _ Faust, president of the
Brazilnuts Portuguese Club, went into her
first year knowing nothing about the
process and found that, after several trips to
the SGB oﬁice, no one would help her.
“No one told me about the allocations
manual,” she said. “Students are supposed
to learn the process, but no onehelps you.”
In planning the club’s Nov. 29
Brazilian Festival, Faust said she went
through six weeks of “trying to work
around all the bureaucracy,” and, in the end,
put more than $200 on her own credit card
and asked a professor to‘ rent the necessary
equipment. She -said that because the food
she requested money 'n for was “non-cultur-

al,” the allocations committee denied it,’

based on the manual’s regulation. Calling
the comrnittee’s reasoning “very vague,”
Faust said she wanted the committee to
abolish its formality and try to relate to her.

“I wish they could talk to me as a stu-
dent,” she said. “They make it rnore-com-
plicated than it needs to be.” 0

When she brought her problems to
allocations’ adviser Terry Milani, he said

that her problem “must have fallen through »

the cracks” and that the. committee is usual-
ly very fair. _
But Kolenda said that every club can

have a copy of the allocations process and

rules, which are laid out in the committee
manual. She stressed handing in requests
“in a timely marmer:” According to the
manual, “organizations must submit their
requests well in advance of the time the
expenditure must be made.”

Kolenda said she also ran into some
problems with the Society of Automotive

Engineers, when the club appealed her ..

comrnittee’s decision to deny $12,600 from
its annual budget to build its racecar. _
According to the club’s secretary, Joe
Berger, the club would now have to resort
to using‘ old, used car parts, which could be
unsafe. But Kolenda stands by the denial,

saying that the club claimed to receive

money from_outside corporations, and was

therefore not in need of money from her '

comrnittee’s already tight budget -

“Every year, they seem to make that
car no matter how much money we give
them,” she said.

Working it out .

But Kolenda and the board recognize
that some glitches in the allocations process
do need to be ironed out.

“We know it’s a problem and we’re
trying to correct it,” Washo said.

I Kolenda and Washo have been work-
ing together this semester to solve these
problems by getting feedback from stu-

Bodies of Marines arrive in Germany

VERNON LOEB
The Washington Post

. ' The bodies of six Marines who died
Wednesday when their KC-130 refueling
plane crashed in Pakistan arrived yesterday
in Germany on their way back to a military
mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware, a military spokesman said
Sunday. '

Crash investigation teams continued
combing a charred mountainside near the
Sharnsi air base in southwestern Pakistan in
search of remains of the seventh victim and
evidence that could help determine why the
four-engine turboprop crashed into a moun-

tainside on the ﬁrst of four scheduled refu-
eling stops.

Investigators found the remains of ﬁve
victims within two days of the crash and the

‘sixth on Saturday and will continue their

search until remains of the ﬁnal victim are

t located, according to Air Force Lt Col.

Martin Compton, a spokesman for the U.S.
Central Command in Tampa.

“The determination of the Marines is,
they leave none of theirs behind,” Compton
said.

In Afghanistan, 30 more Taliban and al
Qaeda prisoners departed from a detention
center at the Kandahar airport at 12:30 p.m.
Eastern time Sunday aboard a C-17 trans-

port plane for Guantanamo Bay in Cuba,‘
bringing to 50 the total number of prisoners
ﬂown there from Kandahar since Thursday.

Another 361 prisoners remain in

1 Kandahar, with 52 others in U.S. custody at

Bagram air base north of Kabul and one —
American John Walker Lindh — being
held on the USS Bataan, an amphibious
assault ship in the Arabian Sea. 7 1

Advance teams from the Army’s 101st
Airborne Division have arrived in
Kandahar to plan for the arrival of at least
2,000 troops, who will be replacing
Marines from the 15th and 26th Marine
Expeditionary Units. .

B-52 and B-1B bombers continued

over the weekend bombing al Qaeda’s
massive Zhawar Kili terrorist training com-
plex 30 miles southwest of Khost near the
border of Pakistan. The complex is about
three miles by three miles, ‘according to
Marine Maj. Brad bowel], another Central
Command spokesman, with 60 structures
above ground and about 50 cave areas.

Air strikes against the complex began
last week when intelligence reports indicat-
ed that, despite earlier heavy bombing, al
Qaeda ﬁghters were regrouping in the area.

“I don’t know if we have covered it
100 percent,” Lowell said of the complex.
“We are hitting areas within that radius that
we feel are necessary to hit.”

New arms deal with Russia threatened

PAUL RICHTER
Los Angeles Times

WASHINGTON — Hopes for a new U.S.-Russian arms
-deal have been clouded suddenly by a U.S. decision to store,
rather than. destroy, some of the thousands of warheads
Washington, D.C., plans to withdraw from active deployment,
U.S. and Russian officials say. '
Even as negotiators prepared to begin work on an agree-
ment, the Pentagon disclosed in a major report on nuclear
forces last week that it wants to hold on to the weapons as a
hedge against new threats'to U.S.. security. Defense oﬁcials
said that in light of the world’s uncertainties and dangers, they
must be able to rebuild U.S. nuclear forces in a relatively short
time.

President Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign said I

he intended to move past the United States’ dangerous Cold
War relationship with Russia, in which each [side maintained
thousands of warheads to deter the other from nuclear attack.
He said he plarmed to “leave the Cold War behind” and late last
year armounced with fanfare plans unilaterally to reduce the
U.S. nuclear arsenal of deployed warheads from 6,000 to
between 1,700 and 2,200. —

But Russian ofﬁcials haveipointed out that a new arms deal
would have little meaning if the warheads taken off submarines,
missiles and bombers could be redeployed in weeks or months.

Any deal must be “irreversible, so that strategic defensive
arms I will be reduced not [just] on paper,” Alexander

Yakovenko, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said -

last week.

A "Pentagon ofﬁcial, J.D. Crouch, insisted that although
some of the warheads will not be destroyed, their decommis-
sioning will have a “very positive beneﬁt” because it will mean
that fewer weapons will be armed and available for use in a cri-
sis. And he said he believed that the Russians “will be doing a
very similar thing.” . ,.

A senior U.S. official who asked to remain unidentiﬁed
said the American side hopes to work out a written agreement
in the latest talks, which are scheduled to begin in Washington,
D.C., this week._The official said the U.S. side intends to ﬁnd a
solution that will be veriﬁable and “transparent” to Russian
negotiators. ‘

But nuclear arms analysts in both countries say the U.S.
move has made it far less likely that the Russians will be offered
the kind of terms they can accept.

Bush administration ofﬁcials have made clear that they pre-
fer to have no treaty agreement, lest it limit their options. The
president agreed at Russia’s urging to try to work out some kind
of written document to codify the arms-reduction plan he and

Russian President Vladimir V. Putin reached in an oral agree-
ment in November.

But analysts say the Russians might have a hard time
acceding to any deal knowing that the United States will con-
tinue to have an uncertain number of warheads in storage. There
are believed to be several thousand U.S. warheads stockpiled.

The existence of the warheads also might make it less like-
ly that the Russians will agree to further unilateral reductions in
their arsenal, as the Americans have hoped, analysts say.

“If the U.S. retains more missiles, so will Russia,” predict-
ed Charles Pena, a defense analyst with the libertarian Cato
Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. “And the Chinese will
likely view the entire U.S. strategic arsenal, not just deployed
weapons, as a threat andjact accordingly.” 

He called the move “an accounting‘ sleight of hand, bad
arms control and bad policy.”

Pena also argued that if the Russians follow the U.S. model
and put their warheads in stockpiles, the weapons might be
unsafe. Hence, “Taking the U.S. weapons off operational
deployment without destroying them could possibly lessen U.S.
security rather than enhancing it,” he said.

Analysts predict that the U.S. move also could cause the

‘Russian military to increase pressure on Putin to take a tougher

line against the United States.

The Russian military leadership hasvbeen strongly behind
Putin, even though he raised only mild objections in December
when U.S. ofﬁcials announced their plans to abrogate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

The treaty sought to block a further buildup of missiles by
barring the two countries from deploying national anti-rnissile
systems. ' - r

The U.S. decision to stockpile warheads rather than destroy
them comes after a year in which the Bush administration dras-
tically has reshaped strategic-security policy.

, Officials have armounced that they intend to leave or ignore
arms control treaties and proposals that they believe bind the
United States while allowing other countries to cheat.

They have armounced plans to build a multibillion-dollar
anti-rnissile defense system while they insist on preserving their
option to rebuild an offensive arsenal. ‘

U.S. ofﬁcials said in last week’s nuclear review that while
they intend to continue to observe the moratorium on nuclear
weapons testing, they want to reduce the time it would take to
prepare a test if they decided to end the 10-year-old moratori-
um. V

They also have left open the possibility that they might seek
to develop a new kind of “penetrator” nuclear bomb that could
be used to destroy the deeply buried bunkers that more and
more countries are building as a defense against U.S. air power.

—dents and by revising the committee’s
manual. Last spring, the committee sent a
survey to all the student groups requesting
feedback on the organization of the manu-
al, the fairness of money distribution and
things the group feels it can’t accomplish
“because of the policies and prohibitions.”

VV1th this information, nurnerous revi-
sions were recently made to the manual.
The structure of certain sections was
changed to make it easier to read, and it’s
now also available on the Internet. Some
policy changes include a $2,000 increase in
the amount that can be allocated for a pro-
gram that is co-sponsored by three groups,
as well as a $4,000 allowance for competi-
tive sports team requests, which was previ-
ously prohibited. Also, before annual bud-
gets are due, the committee plans to go
over mock budgets and requests with the
clubs in a training session.

Kolenda said she thinks this will be a
better way to acquaint the clubs with how
the process works for the future.

“We don’t know what they don’t
know,” she said, “so they have to talk to us.
It’s‘ not my responsibility to walk them

. through the process.” 

Washo said he thinks that these
changes will beneﬁt the current student
clubs, but times will change and the alloca-
tions committee and the board will have to
adapt '

“The manual is an ongoing process
that should always be tweaked, reviewed
and revamped,” he said. “The board should
always be looking at it.” _

Self—imposed segregation

Look around for a moment. Look
‘at the groups of people talking to each
other. Are they a mix of ethnic groups?
Chances are, they’re not.

A recent study by Pitt’s University
Center for Social and Urban Research
found that black people, although they
make up 8 percent of the Pittsburgh
region’s and 30 percent of the city’s
work force, rarely serve on the boards
of major corporations in Western
Pennsylvania.

The study surveyed what The
Pittsburgh Business Times identiﬁed as
the at:ea’s top 50 corporations, receiv-
ing responses from 21 of them. Almost
half of those 2] corporations currently
have no serving black board members.

While distressing at face value, the
results of this survey show a more
deeply rooted problem in the
Pittsburgh area and the United States in
general — although de jure segregation
has for the most part ended, de facto
segregation remains.

Ralph Bangs, the co-author of ‘the
study, was right in saying that under-
representation of blacks on boards was
not any sort of institutionalized racism
in the companies but rather a result of
the fact that “directors and boards don’t
know enough African-Americans _or
see the need to include them or make
diversity a priority.”

Further evidence of the racial

divide came lastwweek with the city’s
request to lift the consent decree
requiring federal supervision of the
police bureau because of its horridcivil
rights’ record. While the city believes
the situation has improved to the point
where the police no longer /need feder-
al supervision to ensure civil rights
compliance, the Pittsburgh chapter of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
strongly disagrees.

When stepping onto a bus, it’s easy
to notice black people sitting with
black people and white people sitting

with white people, even if they don’t-

know each other. How often do we get
on the bus ‘and immediately sit with
someone of our own ethnic group?

In our cafeterias, white people usu-
ally sit with white people, Asians usu-

ally sit with Asians and black people.

usually with other black people.

Groups walking together on the

street show the same phenomenon.

Why is it that we tend to gravitate
toward members of our own ethnic
group? Perhaps it’s subconscious. Few
of us will ever say we are racist, and
hanging around with more people of
our own ethnic group doesn’t mean we
are. But we cannot ignore the segrega-
tion facing our country today, and we
can’t look, to anyone but ourselves to
improve it.

THE PITT NEWS

Showing your appreciation
neither pathetic nor cheesy

Smith, page 6

have as peers and coworkers such
great, considerate and supportive
people, and not just the people who
brought me gifts.

Needless to say, this line of
thought put me in a nice emotional
high. That is until my next line of
thought. For as nice as I thought it
would be to prepare little notes to
let people know that how much I

‘ appreciated their thoughtfulness,.I

quickly put the idea aside. I worried
that these notes would be seen as
cheesy and frivolous, overly senti-
mental and maybe even pathetic.

It seems rare that people write
each other notes and even rarer that
people express how much they
appreciate each other and how
friends make their lives better.

It was a sad revelation resulting
in a decision just to keep my feel-
ings to myself.

But, now I am asking myself,

why not let everyone know how
appreciated they are? Why can’t we
tell each other we enjoy just hang-
ing out? Why must it only be that
we express our appreciation for our
friends when it seems like we are
burdening them? .

No wonder people generally feel
unappreciated, especially in the
workplace. ' ,

So, I’ve changed my mind and
I’ve resolved to let people know —
whether it’s in a thank you note or
just in normal conversation —— that I
appreciate them and all that they do.

So, dear friends, please know
that I appreciate you. Thank you for
all your time, effort and support, for
your love, patience, laughter and
cheer. Thank you for the wonderful
part you play in my life.

LESLIE HOFFMAN
‘ A&E Editor

His father was a gray bathrobe and his
mother was a Kenmore clothes dryer. He
inherited his long, silky hair from the fami-
ly’s Persian cat and the silver specks in his
skin from the gum wrapper his sister left in
her pocket

Now, this little fuzzy “lint guy” stands

, atop a small wooden pedestal at the Duds

‘N’ Suds Laundromat on Centre Avenue.

Kind of crude, but deﬁnitely in the
shape of 3-inch tall men, lint guys have
invaded the Laundromatcourtesy of local
artist Cheryl Capezzuti.

Capezzuti has been collecting lint and
sculpting tiny people out of it since 1994,
while she was in graduate school at Penn
State. By 1996, people who heard of her
sculptures were sending her lint from their
laundry and asking her to_ sculpt lint guys for
them. Today, Capezzuti has an exhibition in
the Laundromat

On a sparkling December afternoon so
warm that Duds ‘N’ Suds has both its doors

open, Capezzuti sits at a table for folding V

clothes and displays her recent lint acquisi-
tions. The Laundromat has a box for patrons
to drop otf their lint so Capezzuti can sculpt
it. Neatly packed into soft clumps in indi-
vidual- plastic bags, she displays emerald
green lint, some burgundy lint and some
lavender lint. A small note accompanies
each submission.

“That’s the fun part, getting the notes,”
she says, as she lugs out a thick photo album
from her bag.‘ She ﬂips through pages of let-
ters from people and stops at a page with a
poem, a story, a drawing and a photograph
of a lint guy, all submitted by
a man Capezzuti says is in

his 60s. W5 Clem” iithﬂl afternoon  [and drew]

because he’s elderly and he

Capezzuti’s project at Duds ‘N’ Suds,
titled, “Lint in the Laundromat,” intends to
create accessible art, but also to challenge
people to create art of their own.

In addition to the lint sculptures,
Capezzuti also olfers lint-based art classes at

Rival Schools took the beauty and purity of high school

2001 cinema:

We laughed, we cried, we threw our
empty popcorn bags at the screen: four
ﬁlm reviewers and one A&E editor vote
on their favorite and most-hated ﬁlms of
2001.

First, the ﬁlms we loved:

1. The‘Man Who Wasn’t There
Starring Billy Bob Thornton, Frances
McDormand, James Gandolﬁni
Directed by Joel Coen ~

As a standard’ exercise in noir, this is the
best ﬁlm since the genre’s heyday. As a
ﬁlm for the new century, the Coen broth-
ers manage to take their standard talents
of story and humor and add itto a tale
with humanity. “The Man Who Wasn’t
There” is a beautifully photographed
work of art, with acting and style to spare.

— Eric Lidji, senior staﬁ writer

After careful questioning of other movie-
goers and a quick survey of the theater,
I’ve come to the conclusion that I must be '
the only person in the world who cried —
wept — at this film. No other ﬁlm of

‘Z001 put me through the same  experi-

ence.
— Leslie Hoﬁfinan, A&E editor

The Coen Brothers have done it again,
this time showing a maturity and grace as
yet unseen. Billy Bob Thornton gives the
best performance of the year.

— Nicholas Zinobile, staff writer

2. Memento _
Starring Guy ‘Pierce
Directed by Christopher Nolan

Disorienting, cynical and perfectly struc-
tured. Christopher Nolan’s ode to amne-
sia and the subconscious is probably the
best ﬁlm this year. Watch it a second time
and enjoy its perfection.

— N.Z.

Innovative ideas are always present in the
arts, but in “Memento,” Christopher
Nolan executes his with tightness and
precision that is a‘ true rarity. Unafraid to
use humor and a few "black and white
interludes when needed, Nolan turns in
the independent debut to end all debuts.
Guy Pierce manages to play a character
that is more weathered at the start of the
movie than the end, but more insightful at
the end than the beginning.

— E.L

Quite possibly the best thriller ever made, *

and almost certainly the most thought‘-
provoking. VV1th a scant production bud-
get of ﬁve million dollars, “Memento”
proves that you don’t need a lot of money.
to make a good movie. Worthy of multi-
ple viewings.

3. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of

-theRing

Starring Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, Cate
Blanchett, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin
Directed by Peter Jackson

‘ Cult film director“ Peter Jackson got his
’ hands on a large budget and created a fan-

tasy masterpiece. This "ﬁlm will change
the way movies based on books are made.
—— B.E.

“Lord of the Rings” is one of the best
movies of the year because of how it will
effect future ﬁlrnmaking. “Lord of the
Rings” is also the book that started the fan-
 genre as _ we know it today. It just
seems ‘so perfect that the book that started
fantasy is the movie that will propel it into
the next stage of its evolution.

David Lynch took something thatwe pre- _
viously thought couldn’t have been sal-
vaged and turned it into the most thought-

‘ provoking picture of the year. Months '

later, I still ﬁnd myself pondering the cir-
cular plots and message. Manipulating‘
both the narrative and ﬁlming techniques,
Lynch makes every part of this ﬁlm
inspire different and ambiguous feelings
in his audience. Naomi Watts manages to
ﬁnd a common thread as an” actress in the
tangle of Lynch’s mind and turns out a
performance that seamlessly shifts
between purposefully shlocky and highly
realistic. ' I

Notre Dame 56
Pitt 53

MONDAY, JANUARY 14, 2002

MATT WEIN
Staff Writer

There was no shortage of excitement and hype
Saturday night as the Panthers, ranked No. 25 in the
nation, rode a l0—garne winning streak into Fitzgerald
Field House to face off against Notre Dame. But the
Panthers did not live up to expectations as they fell to the
Fighting Irish, 56-53, before a sold—out crowd of 6,798.

The opening minutes of the bout were a sign of things
to come. The Fighting Irish defense came out looking »
sharp and did not allow Pitt very many good looks. The
Panthers were held to only ﬁve points in the ﬁrst 13—plus
minutes of play, and trailed by as many as 10.

They shot a dismal 20.7 percent in the first half and
were one-of-ll from three-point range. Though they were
outrebounded on both sides of the ball, the Panthers held
Notre Dame to 21 ﬁrst half points and went into halftime
behind by seven.

“We took a bunch of threes early instead of getting it
inside,” Pitt head coach Ben Howlandsaid. “You always
want to play inside out.” .

Despite the poor ﬁrst half offensive performance, the
Panthers would not fold. Pitt exited the locker room
awake and rejuvenated. When Notre Dame switched to a
man-to-man defense, the Panthers took full advantage.

Pitt closed the gap and took the lead on a three-point-
er by Julius Page. Page’s three-pointercame as part of
what would be a 12-1 scoring run that put the Panthers in
the lead, 26-22.

The Panther defense did its part, not allowing a Notre

 

    

  

Dame ﬁeld goal for the ﬁrst four minutes of the second
half. The strong defensive effort was lead by Ontario Lett,
who had four rebounds and two blocks in the second half
before getting into foul trouble. He‘ ﬁnished with 10
points and eight boards as well as a career high four
blocks. - . _
Despite its early signs of second half dominance, Pitt
was unable to ﬁnish off the Irish, never building a lead
larger than ﬁve points. The Fighting Irish stayed within
striking distance, led by guard Matt Carroll. Carroll had
nine second half points and ﬁnished with 15 to lead all
scorers. ' ‘
The Panthers found themselves up by two points
with 1 minute, 42 seconds remaining in the game when

Carroll made a pair of free throws to tie the score at 53..

Then, with 55 seconds left, Irish forward David Graves
sank a three-pointer that made the difference. Graves ﬁn-

ished two-of-ﬁve from behind the arc with a total of 12 -

points.

Brandin Knight led the Panthers with 13 points and
four.assists, whileDonatas Zavackas chipped in 11 points
and eight rebounds in the loss. , _ »

After the game, Howland said that his team was anx-

ious due to the hoopla surrounding them. _ - I V

' . “All the hype . . . it’s just tough. Our players are going
out to shootbefore the game and now they can.’ t come off

without signing autographs. That’s all new,” Howland . i
said. “We have a young team and we didn’t react well to
that.”

Pitt’s next game is Tuesday when it travels to Miami
to take on the Hurricanes.

Even with Haley Harguth’s career
high seven three-pointers and 21 points,
the Panthers lost to No. 24-ranked
Boston College 81-57 Saturday after-
noon at the Fitzgerald Field House.

With two key players injured,
Harguth just wanted to help the team out.

“I was trying to step up and ﬁll the
gaps in scoring with having Sheila
(Stufﬂet) and Mandy (VV1ttenmyer) out,”
the freshman said. “I was just trying to do
what I can.”

The game was close for the ﬁrst.

seven minutes with both teams taking the
lead several times. Then, at 10 minutes,
53 seconds, with the Panthers leading 12-
11, Eagle forward Nicole Conway hit an
8-foot jumper and ignited the Eagles
players. . ‘

At that point, they stepped up- their
defensive intensity and never lost the

a lead.

“Our perimeter defense did a good
job putting pressure in the lanes,” Eagles
coach Cathy Inglese said.

Laine Selwyn, who is ranked 14th
nationally with 6.5 assists per game,
dished out eight in Pitt’s loss.

With the absence of forwards

VV1ttenmyer and Stufﬂet, Pitt (6-9 over- _

all, 1-3 Big East) tried to rely on its out-

Panther guards in check, disrupting their
scheme. ,' ' -

‘‘They were keying in on our shoot- ,

ers and made it difficult to pass it out,”
guard Laine Selwyn said.

Pitt could not beat the Eagles’ suffo-
cating zone defense, scoring ‘only 11
points in the ﬁnal 12:48 of the ﬁrst half.

“They were keying in on me and
Brooke [Stewart],” Harguth said, “an
that disrupted us.” "

The second half was no different as
the Eagles (12-3 overall, 3-1 Big East)‘
held the Panthers to 36.1 percent from the
ﬁeld. The Panthers also had trouble han-
dling the ball, turning it over '13 times,
the same amount as the first half. I

.“We had too many turnovers and
that’s basically the bottom line,” Selwyn
said.

For the game, Pitt shot 35 percent
compared to 47.6 percent by the Eagles.

Harguth’s hot shooting continued.

throughout the game as she hit four shots
from beyond the arc in the second half.

The closest Pitt got was nine points
after the freshmen hit a three with 16:59
Eeﬂmirling in the game-

Brianne Stepherson led the Eagles in
scoring, hitting six of 11 attempts. She
also contained Selwyn to ﬁve-of-14 from

the ﬁeld and zero for four from beyond

the arc.
Selwyn, who ranked 14th nationally

going into the game with 6.5 assists per ‘

contest, dished out eight, but had seven
tumoversl

Overall, the Panthers outrebounded "

the Eagles 38-35. Bettina Love led the

team with eight boards and also con-

tributed 10 points. _ .
“Bettina Love was huge for us,” hea

coach Traci Waites said of the 6-foot-2-

inch senior. “I am very proud of her.”

' Eagle senior Kim Mackie recorded a
double-double, grabbing 10 rebounds
and scoring 16 points. ‘ 9

With VV1ttenmyer expected to miss

two tofour weeks and Stufﬂet being day 4 «

to -day, Waites believes her team must
“keep going and plugging away.” The

' Panthers will continue with conference

play when they travel to Rutgers on
Tuesday to face the Scarlet Knights.

“We just got to come back and get ’

Rutgers,” Waites said. .._,

Pitt’s men’s basketball team
came into Saturday night boasting a
15-1 record and a 10-game winning
streak. The secret to success was
simple: defense, a persistent patient
offense and timely shooting.
Unfortunately, Notre Dame decided
to copy the Panthers’»path to success.

Brandin Knight is the Panthers’
biggest offensive weapon and the
triggerman that runs the offense from
the point. Notre Dame and its head
coach Mike Brey decided they would
not let Knight defeat them, so they
kept him heavily guarded throughout
the game. I

At the start of the first half, Notre
Dame opened in two defenses, a box

and onezand a diamond and one. Both a

of these‘ defenses put a team in a

four-man zone with one man guard— _

ing another. Knight was constantly
shadowed and guarded -man—to—man.

This great defensive scheme by Brey ,

and the Fighting Irish took the

"Panthers out of their offense, con— »

fused them and forced them into‘ bad
shots.

“The box [or diamond] is some-
thing we used to keep it [the ball] out
of [Knight’s] hands,” Brey said.

The junk defense was successful
early on and that, accompanied by an
overly excited Panthers squad had
the Fighting Irish up by as many as

.11.~

“Our group was way too hyped
and way too anxious,” Pitt head
coach Ben Howland said. “We also
took too many threes.”

The Fighting Irish’s
defense continued throughout the

first half and at half time held the

Panthers to just 14 points on six—of—
29 (20.7 percent) shooting. Included
in those 29 shots were 11 three-point-

ers on which the Panthers connected.

only'one.
In the second half, the Panthers

figured out how to attack the box and
diamond defense and their shooting
showed it. The Panthers shot l4—of—
29 (48.3 percent) in the second half
and connected on four three—pointers.

But down the stretch, it was
Notre Dame’s defense and clutch
shooting that prevailed. »

“We did [box or diamond] well
on key possessions,” Brey said.

. Not only did they play defense on
key possessions, they also scored on
them, connecting on three three-
pointers in the game’s final minutes
to give Notre Dame the come—from-
behind victory.
