Misuraca said he and the stu-

PPC to illuminate the Cathedral on Friday

Pyro, page 4

music released as recently as this
summer. ,

Once he finished with the sound-
track, Misuraca sent it to Zambelli
Firework Manufacturing Company,
in New Castle, Pa. Zambelli is the
company responsible for matching
the firework explosions with the
timing of the music.

"Bob Turco, a Zambelli repre-
sentative, said that the company is
capable of producing more than
10,000 different firework effects.

“Given a certain duplication of
effects that’s inherent, I’d say you’ll
see 500 to 600 of those [in tonight’s
show],” Turco said.

But tonight’s fireworks bear lit-
tle resemblance to the rocket-shaped
bundles of gunpowder Americans
set off in backyards across the
nation on Independence Day. All of
Zambelli’s fireworks are ignited by
a computer system that times their
launch to the tenth of a second.

For tonight’s show, PPC has
taken over Mazeroski Field on
Roberto Clemente Drive to serve as
the launch pad for the aerial show.

Beginning hours before the
show, technicians will set the indi-

vidual shells into mortars — long,
tube-like casings .— following a
careful plan outlined months ahead
of time. f '

Shells come in ,many different
sizes, from 3
inches to 24

inches in
diameter. The
larger the
shell, the

higher it ﬂies.
For tonight’s
show, because
of the proxim-
ity of the audi-
ence, Zambelli
is using 3- and
4-inch shells.
The mor-
tars are then
wired ..to the
computer. At
the necessary
moment, the
c o m p u t e r
sends a signal
that lights the fuse. The fuse then
ignitesthe lift charge, which propels
the shell off the ground. A second
fuse, this one within the shell, deto-
nates the shell at the proper mofnent.
According to Turco, the experts

  “lWbe,(]uthwuirad p
is just gorgeous
when you can

who create the shows used a method
called back timing to make sure that
the shells detonate in time with the
music. _
“We know how long it takes for
' the shell to
ignite
explode,” he
said, “so we
have to count
back how long
it takes to get
to the proper
altitude.”
In addition to
the aerial
effects, the
show will also
feature fire-
w o r k s
launched from
.the Cathedral.
.According to
T u r c o ,

and

in tomorrow’s show, Centrak Lasers
will create a high-tech laser show on
Bigelow. '

Dr. Harold Gerdes is in charge
of tonight’s laser show.

Centrak will use two types of
lasers in tonight’s show, Gerdes
said. One, an argon ion laser, emits
green and blue light, while the other,
a mixed gas argon/krypton ion,
emits colors across the speétrum.
The beams will be projected through
a sheet of material called holograph-
ic radial diffraction grading, which
splits the beam into many beams of
different colors.

“This is a pretty wild show,”
Gerdessaid. “It’s very upbeat.”

According ‘to Gerdes, what
makes this show particularly fun is
the fact that the lasers are run live
by a technician at a keyboard, “like
a musical instrument” so that they

are in sync with the fireworks and

the soundtrack.

Misuraca said the homecoming
fireworks. and laser show began
when students became disenchanted
with the annual homecoming
parade.

“This was the alternative to the

parade,” he said. “I don’t know of

any other place that does this.”

ni to mingle and possibly even learn."
For a non—traditional activity,
attend one of the Alumni Association’s
Saturday morning “classes without
quizzes” on topics such as architecture
and non—verbal communication. Or
check out the Pitt Club on Friday
evening, where you can enjoy music,

-dancing and karaoke‘ for $3.

For more traditional homecoming
happenings, join the droves of students
and alumni on Bigelow Blvd at 9 p.m.
Friday night for Pitt Program Council’s
annual laser and fireworks show. After
the show, head into the William Pitt
Union for more PPC sponsored arcade
games and music.

But be sure to make the trek up
Cardiac Hill to Fitzgerald Field House
by 11 p.m. for your first chance to
check out the men’s and women’s bas-

ketball teams. This year’s Midnight
Madness will include three-point and
slam dunk contests as well as chances
for students to win cash. '

Friday night’s festivities will have
to end at a decent hour so that we can
get up early for the unnecessarily early
football game. Choosing noon for a
homecoming game — the central event
of the weekend’s activities —— seems
like an unfortunate oversight, especial-
ly following Friday’s midnight events.

Regardless, certainly many stu-
dents will suck it up and make it out of
bed as early as.9 a.m. to make it down-
town for tailgating festivities.

After getting up so. early, one can
only hope that Walt Harris and the foot-
ball tearn will at least deliver a worth-
while performance. Over the past
decade, Syracuse bestowed upon the
Panthers a tradition Pitt shouldn’t be
proud of. Pitt hasn’t beaten Syracuse
since ‘89.

If Pitt can’t break the tradition, at
least there will be the homecoming

cruise as well as other post-game par-

ties to finish up ,a festive homecoming
weekend. I 8

Finding a point in ‘pointless’ homecoming rituals

Homecoming is a regression to
high school days. Here we are, mature
adults, electing a beauty queen and
going crazy about an opportunity to

Even the tradition of homecoming
king and queen elections can be uplift-

ing. People thrive on hero-worshipping. .

Look no further than our inordinate

dressed up.

Whether it serves an
obvious purpose or not,
homecoming offers good
reason to celebrate. True,
it’s just another game, and
football is just a sport and
tomorrow will be a day like

self to get caught up in the

respect for Hollywood
celebrities as proof.
And, contrary to popu-
lar belief, this year’s elec-
’tions were not all about
looks. I personally found the
candy, lighters and condoms
to be - quite persuasive in
their own right.
, Maybe plastering
homecoming posters on all
objects stationary for more

tradition.

That tradition makes the most out
of less-than-rousing circumstances. For
example, homecoming was always a
huge event at my high school, regard-
less of the fact that you probably could-
n’t find someone who remembers a
game in the 40 years since the school
was built.

. The ‘whole week was sort of an
escape from the normal constraints of
school — a time to make fools of our-
selves in the noble name of school spir-
it. By the time we rushed the ﬁeld at the
end of the big game, nobody even cared
that we were down by 61 points. We
knew we were No. 1!

Homecoming is a chance to take
pride in our school — something most
students don’t do often enough.

than five minutes was a bit

excessive. And I’m sure that the people

who sweep the Ashtray are ready to

assassinate the candidates for the mess
they left on Election Day. ‘

But I thinkmost of us enjoy the

custom in spite of its beauty pageant

tendencies. After all, we all need some-

one to simultaneously revere, envy and
hate. -

Latka Gravits, a foreign New York
cab driver played by the great Andy
Kaufman, once defended his bizarre
culture, saying, ‘fMeaningless ‘rituals
and mindless traditions are what sepa-
rate us from the animals.” In other
words, the significance of something
like homecoming lies not in the event
itself, but in the feelings it draws out of
us.

ILLUSTRATION BY MATTHEW GAYDOS/EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATOR

— By watching the homecoming
game with friends and showing support
for our team, we get to share an awe-
some experience with fellow students
and friends. Homecoming brings us
together in a pleasant afternoon, provid-
ing an excellent chance to share some
brotherly love. Or at least a bag of sta-

dium popcorn. V
So remember: Put ‘a point in a

_ pointless ritual by having a good time.

Cheering like a maniac is good for the
heart. Try it and share your experience
with columnist Elizabeth Strohm at
jestrohm@yahoo.com.

Anyone with a clue knows that,
in general, people like things to fol-
low patterns. It’s just too confusing
and challenging for us not to make
assumptions from certain cues.
When we think about people, we
can’t help but categorize them in
several ways: our relationship to
them, their social stereotype, their
personality type, and so on.

If you don’t know this already,
do yourself and the people around
you a favor and take any intro psych
course it’ll assign hard—to-
remember names like “schema” to
ideas that should be common
knowledge, but then at least you’ll
gain some.

Modern academics generally
embrace the approach that sexual
preference exists on a continuum
rather than in two categories. This
-is evident if you’ve taken any gen-
der studies courses.

But this fluid approach to sexu-
al preference and behavior isn’t
applied in general consciousness.
Even among the educated ——. or

especially among the educated, if
Pitt is in any way representative -
a strong distinction is made
between male and female,

Seeing sexual orientation as it is — on

erosexual culture really pisses me
off — I just don’t identify with it. I
refuse to follow stereotypes of what
to wear, what to eat,

gay and straight, and there’s
an undeniable assumption of
heterosexuality.

Maybe if you know
something about sexuality,
you can make distinctions
like submissive or dominant
and butch or femme, but
those traits are just too sub-
tle for most people to pick
up and the words are too

 

David Chung

Columnist

what sports to play,
what music to listen
to, or anything else
the notion of hetero-
sexuality extends to
— which is only, um,
let’s see,‘ everything
in the world.

I dig ballet, garden-
ing, and art. So appar-
ently I’m really

freaky.
Actually, I’m afraid to think

' about what further categorizations

we’d pigeonhole ourselves into if
we did. Considering the immense
reach of masculine and feminine
stereotypes, I’m glad ‘most people
don’t know if they’re tops or bot-
toms. Surely we’d make other
ridiculous changes to our lifestyles
to conform as we have to gender
and preference. .
Personally, I love girls. But het-

“gay”. Not entirely by
coincidence, I also happen to like
boys, so‘ that’s fine with me.

But I also dislike, to a lesser
extent, “gay” culture. I really wish
it were true that bisexuality was, as
stated in one of my anthropology
lectures, “much more common than
exclusive homosexuality.”
Bisexuality is still strongly stigma-
tized in western culture. Maybe we
claim openness to homosexuality,

"but even that’s questionable, espe-

a continuum

cially in the South.

In general, it’s considered a
very, verybad thing to be gay in
America. ‘

When I graduated from high
‘school, I moved to Manhattan. New
York City is far from ideal, but one
thing I really like about New

Yorkers is that they never assume’

your sexuality like the rest of
America does. And even_if words
like “gay” or “straight” come up, it
doesn’t necessarily preclude rela-
tionships with any gender, nor does
it necessarily preclude any interests
or behavior.

So what do I want? I just want
people not to be so shocked when

someone who fits_ their “straight”

pattern of behavior does something

I “gay.” I want straight ‘people not to

be afraid to do “gay” things.
I want the pattern to blur a little.

David"Chung actually is happy with
some things — he just.doesn’t write
about them in his columns. Send

Polite patriotism

You’ve seen it before. Just as the sitcom you’re watching
breaks for commercial, generic patriotic music ﬂares up, a mass
of blue—collar Americans waving ﬂags appears, a camera pans
over a sea of yellow ribbons. The shot
then fades to the television stations’
icon. We are all one. The heartwarm-
ing public service armouncement ends.

It’s disgusting the way the media
has marketed patriotism so heavily.
We see it everywhere —— NBC’s pea-
cock now sports a modiﬁed version of
Old Glory; every new military action
has a snappy slogan attached to it by
news networks. Flip through the pages
of People magazine, and see shots of
your favorite celebrities sporting stars-

Pourquoi?

and—stripes baby tees. ’ A
Last night, some of my friends and I joked about a ﬂa
marketed to stick on either your car or your mailbox. One of
my friends said that the ﬂag he has attached to his motorcycle
was made in China. , .
Perhaps it’s apropos that our ﬂag, a symbol of capitalism,
should be so widely marketed, but you don’t have to plaster
yourself in red, white and blue paraphernalia to be patriotic.
Despite my gripes, I am’ not against patriotism. I love my
country. I love Americans. I thinkiour ﬂag is beautiful. I just
don’t want to see it — or patriotism —— de-valued by mass mar-
keting and ridiculous tackiness.
Of course, tackiness is also a part of being American, but I

have to admit, I think a single American ﬂag hanging from the a

porch of a home in a small town is the embodiment of grace
and the essence of patriotism. It’s personal, and shows that real
people live there and actually care about their country.

So, in defense of patriotism, I give you 10 ways to be a
tacky patriot. Avoid these suggestions. - .

1) The wearing of the ﬂag. Small, tasteful jewelry is
acceptable. Club wear and stretched-out T-shirts are not. Some
of those damn ties are terrible, too. .

2) Permanently emblazoning symbols of patriotism on

your body. This also falls under the rubric of the wearing of the _

ﬂag.

face paint here, -not a stars—and-stripes motif on a little girl’s
face at a parade.‘ '

4) Playing clips of the news coverage of the terrorist
attacks over inspirational. soft rock‘ from the ‘80s. Something
like this popped up the weekend after Sept. 11’. My friends and
I_ christened this the “terrorist mix.” Not only is it in poor taste,
it’s offensive. v -

5) Confederate ﬂags. \Vrth Elvis. They exist.

6) Black socks with shower sandals. Ohiwait, that’s a way
to be a tacky tourist. ~

7) Re-enacting famous battles. They’Ve already happened;
let’s not dwell on it.

8) If you work for a retail corporation, immediately releas-
ing a T-shirt with a picture of the American ﬂag, a bald eagle,
Lady Liberty, or another such image accompanied by your
company logo. ' - .

9) Associating sporting events with patriotism.

10) Not knowing the words to the National Anthem.

Embrace patriotism, but not so much that your zeal
degrades it. I

Love. your country. Respect your country. Don’t market‘

your country. A

3) Face paint. We’re ‘talking about overzealous .footbal1—fan A

-_*C_an youj.comb_i‘ne the best of
Eryfk;ah'_“Badv(1 ’vStfe-vie—. Nicks and
Fiona ,A,A.pp1e._sana come up with
something" spectacular? Res, a 23-
year-old artist whose album How I
Do debuted last summer on MCA
Records can.

With 16 intoxicating tracks, she
weaves a web that’s hard to escape.
What girl can’t relate to the lyrics
of the first track “Golden Boy?”
She sings, “Those golden boys/All
a fraud don’t believe their
show/Would they love you if they
knew all the things that we know?”

The title track is an anthem of
independence. Res lets everyone
know, “Hey sometimes that’s how I
do/And if you feel that bad/Maybe
it’s not for you.” Her lyrics are
laid—back but powerful. “If There
Ain’t Nothing” tells the story of a
relationship gone sour. A great song
mends a broken heart and this one
should do the trick.

The best song on the album is
actually the secret song. Just when
the soulful journey seems to be at
its end, Res hits you with a rockin’
track. While the rest of the album is
filled with mellow beats andpan
occasional piano, the secret track
lets loose’ with a rock ‘n’ roll cho-
rus and great lyrics. She howls
about a broken heart and standing
up for herself, butpshe never points
a finger. It’s all rawemotion.

Res’s album could be perfect
It’s hard to'object~ to any single
"song because of the way she mas-
terfully blends hip-.ho.p, soul and
rock. With the" ‘strength of the
album, it’s hard to imagine she
couldbe anything but great live.

Buy the album. Then, check her
out Monday at Heinz Hall with
Maxwell.

. This question plagues the music
world: What becomes of the brokenheart-

Well, if you’re young, have a penchant

always got picked last for team sports, you
may ﬁnd solace in an emo band.

Kansas natives released their debut album,
Designing a Nervous Breakdown, with the
help of touring pals and fellow emo—philes
The Get Up Kids, on the newly formed

label Heroes and Villains. A new album, —

Your Majesty, is due out in January 2002.

For those who don’t wear their hearts
on their sleeves, the term “emo” is short for
emotional punk, which gained popularity
in the ‘90s ina post-hardcore revolution. It
is meant to incorporate punk rock’s energy
with more melody and less nihilism.

But, much like Weezer’s frontrnan
Rivers Cuomo, the band dismisses the emo
title, which has a reputation for being
whiny and trite. .

Dan Hicks and the Hot
Licks

Tomorrow, 7:30 p.m.
Rosebud, $18

(412) 261-2221

' His band may be hot, °but Dan
Hicks is so cool on stage, it’s surprising
he doesn’t get frostbite.

Playing at Rosebud this "Saturday
with his legendary band, The Hot
Licks, Hicks is known for his ability to
increase the possibilities of what the
guitar can do.

He can take basic three—chord theo-
ry, beat it into submission, teach it his
superior manipulation of classy riffs
and his knowledge of the fretboard,
and then reﬁne it to create a sound that

has the standard elements of jazz, folk, -

gypsy, country, blues and rock music
with a ﬂair all his own. .
So it stands to reason that after 30
years, his music is still utterly unique
and fresh.
But his skills as a performer are

'_ just as strong as his talents as a musi-

cian. Hicks has a mellow stage persona
— evident on his live albums —— that
teeters on the edge of deadpan, but

. never on the edge of uninteresting.

On Shootin’ Straight, his rnid-90s
live album with the Acoustic Warriors,
the band has to retune their instruments

mid.—set. Hicksmakes an "off-the-cuff’ e
“We’re not the .

apology, saying,
Grateful Dead, they can play for eight
hours straight. We’re not that good.”
Hicks can combine pre-thought-out
quips and comments with extempora—
neous audience feedback. Between

songs, he tells great stories. He tries to .

preface every character-driven song
with an— explanation of that character.
He explains the song’s origins and

_ inspirations in his mind or, if it’s- a

cover song, the relationship between
himself and the original_ artist or the

A original song.

. _ The band willplay songs from their
last two albums, Beatin’ the Heat, the
band’s first album together in 26 years,

and Alive and Lickin’, the" first live"

album since they reunited. They will
present some unreleased songs as well.

‘Spaced out

Immediate Action Tour
Sunday, 8 p.m.
Millvale Industrial Theater,

$7
(412) 321-Mn'r

Get ready to trip out into a sonic land-

_ scape that’s as alien as a voyage into space.

Unlike the Russian space program, the
Immediate Action Tour, consisting of Hefty
Records’ Slicker, Telefon Tel Aviv, Beneath
Autumn Sky, Twine and Glowinthedark,
won’t cost you millions — only a mere $7.

Those unwilling to broaden their hori-
zons and especially those with strong dis-
like of electronic music should avoid this
event. These artists defy classiﬁcation, but
have distinct inﬂuences of minimal, tech-
house, classical, jazz and hip—hop.

Their intentions are clear — the music
from all the artists is perfect for a chill—out
session at an after—hours club. The sound is
as cool as a vodka martini, and smooth as
the body of an Aston Martin.

People cynical about electronic music
believe the process of creating music is
automatic because of new technology. In
truth, the process has become more com-
plex, and there is more freedom to accept
new rules and ideas. This is the concept

 

Mn‘ STIIIIENT mscoum

Quit pulling if

John Hughes ——the owner of Hefty V
Records and also known as Slicker --
adopts to create some of the most spacey,
atmospheric and experimental songs
recorded.

 
 

Hughes’ works are more minimal than
Telefon Tel Aviv and Glowinthedark. His
songs provide mood rather than going
through movement or building up of sound
like most other music. The beat and

rhythms of most songs almost remain con-
sistent. '

The sound of Telefon Tel Aviv, Joshua
Eustis and Charles Cooper, is calm, slow
and antiseptic. The duo juxtapose blissful
melodies with condensed beats and only-
God-knows—what random noises. The
melodies provide a strong sense of structure
in Telefon Te1Aviv’s songs. The beats and
random noise are more expressively ran-
dom, which brings in the jazz inﬂuence.

How both parts ﬁt together is. certainly ‘

taboo in pop. music, but it is so much more
interesting. ‘

Disk jockeys Smaze and Zane3’s
Beneath Autumn Sky contribute their hip-
hop infested break beats to the show. Their
raw, unpolished sound is true to old-school
hip—hop ﬂavor. VV1th no rapper, Beneath

-Autumn Sky is straight beats —— smooth

and soothing, like mother’s milk.

Traditionally, electronic music at live .

venues consists of DJs mixing records. But
the artists of Immediate Action Tour are
actually going to play their songs.

“Electronic music is a tough thing to
pull off live because people are quick to dis-
miss it as a live music form,” Hughes said
in an interview posted on Hefty Records’
Web site.

For those who refuse to be restrained
by popular culture’s demand, experience
this.

turtlenecks. A bunch of guys wear baggy
jeans and button—down shirts. Some of the
others move their heads up and down, giving
the girls just a glimpse of their faces from
underneath the brirns of their baseball hats.

B—bonics plays a popular dance song
and a group of guys standing ‘in the comer
starts the Electric Slide. Yes, this dance is
infamous at weddings and family reunions,
but more and more people start to catch on
in the pub. VV1thin seconds, numerous peo-
ple are laughing while doing the Electric
Slide.

Susan Barnett, 21, walks inwith her 51-,

year-old mom Janet. At the entrance, one of
the bouncers hits on Janet, and then asks if
she and Susan are sisters. Janet blends in
with her purple shirt. Sipping from her glass
of wine, she talks with Susan and comments
onall the cute guys.

According to Susan, “My mom and I
are having fun. She likes being wiﬂi me and
getting a View of a typical college weekend.”
Janet continues to sit with her daughter and

‘her friends, while tasting their mixed drinks.

Along with the music, Pub I.G. offers a
unique  of liquor and exotic beers. The
bartenders make dark chocolate, white
chocolate and fruity martinis. Beer drinkers
can ﬁnd every domestic bottle and a wide
range of Indian pale ales.

It isn’t hard to understand why people
come here every weekend. Two Pitt stu-
dents, Marina Augoustidis and Rose
Leichliter agreed, “We’re regulars here
because it’s close and we never know whom
we might run into.” According to these two,
everyone goes all-the time. It’s a place where

they can see their ﬁiends and let loose;

The baseball playoffs are in full
swing. This year’s post-season promis-
es to be one of the most exciting and
competitive ones in recent memory.

The Seattle Mariners, boasting
baseball’s best record, are taking on the
Cleveland Indians, champions of the
American League’s Central division.
The other AL series pits the perennial
Eastern division-winning Yankees
against the upstart Oakland Athletics,
winners of the AL’s Wild Card playoff
spot.

In the National League, the Atlanta
Braves, winners of every Eastern divi-
sion title over the past decade, take on
the Houston Astros, who captured the
Central division crown on the last day
of the regular season. The Arizona
Diamondbacks, winners of the West,
take on the Wild Card team, the St.
Louis Cardinals. .

Chances are, you don’t care. Ask
around campus and you will hear a
variety of reasons that very few people
will be watching the baseball post-sea-
son this year.

“Oh, my team has been out of the.

race since late June,” is a pretty big one
in Pittsburgh. “It’s hockey season!” is
another popular one these days. There
is also the timeless classic, “Oh, I don’t
care, it will just be the Yankees again.”
It’s true, many people are sick of base-
ball, and given the current economic
state of the game, the feelings of these
“October skeptics” carry much validity.

One item that has not received

‘ much media recognition this baseball

season is the fact that the collective bar-
gaining agreement expires at the end of

How does a team end a -losing
streak?

The Pitt football team hopes to
do it by defeating an opponent it
hasn’t been able to top in 11 years:
Syracuse.

The Panthers and Orangemen
will collide in a homecoming
matchup Saturday. at noon. A crowd
of more than 50,000 is expected at
Heinz Field. 4

This is the 57th game between
the Big East foes, with Syracuse
leading the all-time series 28-25-3,
including last year’s 24-17 double
overtime victory at the Carrier
Dome. Pitt has lost 10 straight
meetings with the Orangemen, with
its last win coming on Sept. 23,
1989. I
8‘ The Panthers will look to end

not only that drought, but the one

they have found themselves in this
season after dropping their past
three contests. The team is just 1-3,
despite high preseason expectations
and is in jeopardy of a losing sea-
son. , '

“It’s basically not a choice to do

down the drain,” wide receiver R.J.
English said. “It’s a_must win for

It won’t be easy because the
Panthers will be faced with stop-

four consecutive games after drop-
ping its first two. The Orangemen
are coming off a narrow 24-17 win

Midnight Madness starts weekend

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

If you want a chance to win $25,000 tonight,then head to the
Fitzgerald Field House, when Pitt tips off the men’s and women’s
basketball seasons with the festivities of Midnight Madness.

The annual event, which signiﬁes the time when basketball
teams can officially begin practice, kicks off at midnight.
Admission is free to students. V

Throughout the night, fans will have the opportunity to take
part in shooting contests and challenges to win prizes, including
ofﬁcial Panther and season tickets. _

Midnight Madness culminates with an introduction of both
Panther basketball teams. Team events include a scrimmage
between the men’s team, a three-point shooting contest that will
involve students and a slam—dunk contest.

The dunk contest should deﬁnitely be interesting, as the
event will feature high-ﬂying shooting guard Julius Page. Page
cemented his go-to-the-hoop style in the minds of many fans last
season, when he delivered a Michael Jordan—1ike slam over seven
foot tall Georgetown center Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje. .
There will be plenty of room for fans to get involved as well. Six
fans will have the opportunity to win $5,000 in an around-the-
world shooting challenge. Ten contestants will take place in a bat

and one lucky fan will have the chance to sink a 3/4 court shot,
to win $25,000.

The Panthers’ pep band, dance team and cheerleaders will
also be in attendance. .

The men’s team is coming off of itsmost successful season
in a decade,.posting a 19-14 record._ '

The team concluded the season winning seven of its last 10 _

games. The Panthers upset Miami, Notre Dame and Syracuse on
their way to the Big East Championship game and their efforts
were rewarded with a spot at the National Invitational
Tournament.

Miami had won six of eight games going into the opening
round game against Pitt and Notre Dame and Syracuse were both
ranked in the top 20 nationally. _

The Panthers won their opening NIT game against St.
Bonaventure 84-78, in front of a packed house at the Field House
before losing to Mississippi State 66-61, in the second round.

With the departure of Ricardo Greer and Isaac Hawkins, the
Panthers return three starters. The backcourt returns as junior
Brandin Knight leads the team at point guard, with Page, -a»

KEVIN NASH
Staff Writer

Football at Syracuse University dates
back to Nov. 23, 1889, when it played in its
ﬁrst intercollegiate game. This was its only
game of that-season, and, wearing blue and
pink uniforms, Syracuse was defeated 36-0
by Rochester.

The next season, orange became the
main color for Syracuse and that is how the
name “Orangemen” came to be.

The Orangemen used different parks
throughout the city of Syracuse as its home

. until the team ﬁnally settled on the Oval in

1895.

Eventually the team moved into John
D. Archbold Stadium in 1907, which was
considered to be a top of the line stadium at
ﬂiat time. In 1979, John D. Archbold stadi-
um closed and in 1980, the Courier Dome
opened, which was the ﬁrstdomed stadium
in the Northeast. 1

Syracuse’s ﬁrst real rival was Colgate.
The rivalry began in 1897, when a news
reporter, who was rooting for Colgate,
tackled a Syracuse player to prevent him

from scoring the winning touchdown. The .

game ended in a 6-6 tie.

Syracuse started another rivalry in
1922 when it began a series with Penn
State at the Polo Grounds in New York.
The ﬁrst game ended in a scoreless tie. The

p ' two teams continued to meet regularly until

1990.

In 1938, Wrlrneﬂi Sidat-Singh, one of
the ﬁrst black quarterbacks in college foot-
ball, led the Orangemen. Sidat-Singh won
praise for his comeback win against
Cornell that season. .

Syracuse went to 20 bowl games dur-
ing its long history. At one point it had a 13-

year stretch, in which it went to 11 bowl.

games. The Orangemen are 11-8-1 in bowl
appearances, as they went to their ﬁrst
Orange Bowl in 1952, losing 61-6 to
Alabama. ‘

In 1959, the Orangemen won their ﬁrst
and only national championship with a 23-
14 win over Texas in the Cotton Bowl.

j  Syracuse has long history  

In 1961, rrmning back Ernie Davis
became the ﬁrst black recipient of -the
Heisman Trophy Award. He is the only
Syracuse player to win the award, but
sadly, Davis died two years later of
leukerrria.

Forty Orangemen have been selected
as All-Americans in their history.

Many players from Syracuse make it
to the NFL. Popular names include Jim
Brown, John Mackey, Jim Ringo, Art
Monk, Daryl Johnston, Marvin Harrison,
Quadry Ismail, Gary Anderson, Rob
Burnett and Donovan McNabb.

Brown, Ringo, Mackey, Larry
Csonka, and Oakland Raiders owner Al
Davis are former Syracuse players who
have made it to the NFL’s Hall of Fame.

The number 44 has a lot of history and
stories behind it as well. Many of the leg-

' ends of Syracuse football ‘have worn that '

number. One well-known legend that wore
the jersey was Hall of Fame nmning back
Jim Brown. Because so many legends in
Syracuse football wore number 444, it is
considered an honor to wear it. The univer-
sity even changed its ZIP code ﬁom 13219
to 13244. The coaching. staﬁ” also allowed
Rob Konrad to wear it in 1995. No one will
wear the number this season.

The Orangemen have had 14 consecu-

tive winning seasons. Current head coach
Paul Pasqualoni has 52 league victories,
has led Syracuse to the most Big East
Championships of. any active coach in the
league and he has more wins than any other
current Big East coach.
_ Pitt won its ﬁrst meeting with
Syracuse 30-0 in 1916. Pitt dominated the
series 10-4 until 1956 and tied twice during
that period. Pitt has only been able to win
15 meetings since 1956 compared to
Syracuse’s 24 wins.

When Pitt and Syracuse clash on
Saturday, it will be for the 56th time.
Syracuse leads the series, winning 28 out
of the 56 meetings, while the teams tied
three times. Last year’s meeting resulted in
a 24-17 overtime victory by Syracuse. Pitt
last beat the Orangemen in 1989.

The Panthers will need to find a

a sack.

“I don’t know anything about
him other than he has 10 sacks,”
Priestley said. “It just means he’s
been hot and hopefully we can cool

The Panthers will need some
players of their own to catch fire as
the team produced five turnovers

gained just 50 yards rushing. As a
result, the team made it a top prior-

continue his steady contribution.
He leads the team with 312 receiv-

touchdowns. He isfirst in the Big
East with 78 receivingyards per

_ game.

“We can’t turn the ball over,

Pitt will also hope to have the A

momentum of the homecoming fes-
tivities‘. The Panthers have gone 21-
9-1 in homecoming games since .
1970, including a stretch of 15
games between 1976 and. 1990
where they did not lose. The team
put up a memorable performance
last season when it shut down Penn

tests six times and have gone 3-3 in
those matchups, but lost the three
most recent matchups. Perhaps the

added atmosphere will be the extra .

boost the Panthers need.

ing and have a home game,” Harris
said. “There will be an enthusiastic
crowd andl think it’s always nice
that'there’s a lot of hoopla on cam-
pus, our players get into that.”

But beyond the festivities, the
Panthers know that the game this
weekend could be a deciding factor
in which direction the season goes.

“Getting a win against Syracuse
would help turn us around and give
us an opportunity in the Big East,”
Priestley said. “Our season is defi-
nitely not over yet.”

THE PITT NEWS

Another strike may loom forbaseball

Column, page 26

this year’s World Series. As of yet, there

has been no talk from either the_

Players’ Association or the owners
about renewing the agreement.

If an agreement is not reached in
time for spring training, there will be
another work stoppage. A stoppage
would indicate that both sides are hav-

, ing problems coming to terms on a new

deal (don’t blame just the players or just
the owners). There is a very good
chance that there will not be any.base—
ball next year.

Having said this, I call upon every-
one who has ever loved baseball, every-
one who has ever enjoyed watching a
game, everyone who has, at any point in

. his or her life, felt moved by the drama

of October baseball, every rabid fan,
every casual fan, to take the time this
month to watch just one baseball game.

Chances are that this year, you will
see a bit more competition than you are
used to in the playoffs. The teams are
matched up better than they have been
in recent years. Traditional “World
Series competitors like the Yankees and
Braves have aged and are likely to play
more at the level of teams such as -the
Cardinals and Athletics.

Are you sick of watching the
Yankees have a mediocre season, finish

the schedule losing nine out of their last
ten games, and then go on to utterly
dominate the playoffs?

If you are, then check out the
Yankees/Athletics series. The A’s won
the first game, with their young ace
Mark Mulder out—dueling ﬁve-time Cy
Young award—winner Roger Clemens.
You may recall that when these two
teams met last year, the A’s came one
out away from upsetting the Yankees.

The Mariners, who are the best
team in baseball, were shut out in the
first game of their series with the
Indians, before winning last night’s
game.

The Astroshave their backs to the
wall, having dropped the first two
games of their best—of—five«series to the
Braves. .

The Diamondbacks pulled out a
game—one victory against the Cardinals
behind a pitching performance from ace
Curt Schilling that can only be
described as stellar. The Cardinals then
beat Cy Young winner and- strikeout
machine Randy Johnson in game two.

Make no mistake; this is some truly
great baseball. The odds of a team like
the D’backs or the Athletics playing in
the October Classic this year are ever
growing. And even if the Braves end up
playing for a pennant or the Yankees
end up capturing another World Series,

do yourself a favor and tune in. You are
going to see a great baseball game.

If and when you do watch playoff
baseball this fall, simply watch and

allow yourself to enjoy the game.

When you watch the A’s take on the
Yankees, don’t think about the “likeli-
hoodthat their first baseman, Jason
Giambi, will leave the team after the
season. Instead, concentrate on the
clutch hit he needs to get to beat the
Yanks.-  .

Forget that the D’backs are an
aging team that will likely have trouble
contending in the future if their man-
agement doesn’t start spending more
money. Instead, focus on Curt Schilling
playing in his first post—season in eight

_ years. -

When baseball concludes this fall,
there may be a fairly lengthy wait for it
to return. If the game is on hold next
year, we can voice our displeasure for
its shortcomings, inadequacies, and
troubles then. For now, we should just
enjoy it in its purest form, not as a busi-
ness, but as a game. Enjoy it while it’s
here, it may not be back tomorrow.

Matt Wein is a columnist for the Pitt
News. This column is dedicated to my
grandfather Hesh Herman, who always
said, “There will never be another
game like baseball.”
