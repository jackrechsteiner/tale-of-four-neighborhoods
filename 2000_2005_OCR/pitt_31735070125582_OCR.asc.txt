- Oakland groups battle 
  garbage with gamption  

RENEE ALBERTS
The Pitt News

Under the buzz of hordes of ﬂies, someone passing
through one of Oakland’s side streets can almost hear the
tortured howls of horriﬁed environmentalists. The putrid
smell of rotting, decaying. garbage overwhelms the per-
fume of any plant life that isn’t already buried in waste.
All the signs are there: Pitt students must be moving
in. . ' i

V But Oakland’s residents aren’t the only ones aware
of the unforttmate repercussions of such a large volume
of people moving in and out in such alsmall period of
time.

In response to the heaps of garbage,. Pitt, the
Oakland Business Improvement District, Oakland
Planning and Development Corporation, City of
Pittsburgh Department of Public Works and Goodwill
Industries have banded together to try to amend the situ-

ation. Today is the last day the Mini Clean Sweep pro- ’

gram will collect the extra trash along many of Oakland’s
side streets, free of charge. P

Heaps of garbage piled outside apartment buildings on Dawson Street are among the extra refuse created by
the yearly migration of thousands of students. ‘

To some of the residents of.Oakland, theMini Clean the problem is not only the garbage, but also the stu-

“Hopefully, [the garbage] gets moved real quick.

What are the odds that three Josephs, all of
whom are on a waiting list for student housing,

-' would be placed together in one converted

lounge? -

Get out your Powerball tickets, and put up
your lightning rods, it ‘seems the luck of the draw
is favoring the ‘slim-to-none’ category these
days. '

As the lines of yellow carts would suggest,
the beginningof each new semester is always a
rather tumultuous time and, until the debris set-
tles, the SD or so students who are waiting for
‘campus housing are left wondering whether they
will ever have permanent housing. ’

It is a typical problem not only here at Pitt,

but at campuses all over.

When there are more students than rooms,
housing services is forced to find other places to
board students.

Joseph Williamson is one of those students

‘this year. Williamson, a freshman, is living
indefinitely in a converted loungein Tower C
with two other misplaced Josephs. He said that
he was notified of the makeshift situation before
he arrived, but that he was not given a timeline
for when he would be ableto move somewhere
more permanent. '
“They won’t set a date,” he said.
-The room is rather large by collegiate stan-

dards, but when three people are going about‘

daily businessit proves too crowded for most
anything extra. ‘
“We should have had two more desks in
’ here,” Williamson said.
The only desk they have now was brought by

' one of the roommates.

University spokesman Robert Hill said that
all students who were guaranteed housing before
this semester received it, and that the 50 in limbo
are there because they applied for housing after

. the deadline. .

Hill also said that of the students who

received housing, there is always a “normal

Livin’ in the lounge with no   guarantees,

attrition process,” as some students do not show
up, and others move out for various reasons. But,
Hill said, until those studentshave been given
adequatetime to claim their rooms, students like
Williamson will have to continue waiting.

There is no standard amount of waiting time
before a room is forfeited. Williamson said he
and his roommates were guessing how long it
would be; one said two weeks while another fig-
ured it would be an~entire semester.

Either could be right. All he was told was “if
you are going to move then we will let you
know.” ,‘ '

For now the three just have to adjust without
getting too comfortable. . -

Hill said that these students have been
encouraged to look for off—campus housing if
they are not pleased.

“Having two roommates, it’s kind of a lot
because there is never any time alone.”

Nevertheless, Williamson said he wouldn’t
complain.

“Unless it gets really annoying,” he added.

Hillel barbecue ge

~ SYDNEY BERGMAN
The Pitt News

It's 1:30 in the afternoon and 225 cans
of soda are gone. Leis and plastic buckets
litter tables on the front lawn of the William
Pitt Union and smiley-face pinwheels spin
in the breeze.

The soda-guzzling, pinwheel—twirling
partying was part of Hillel’s Fourth Annual
Welcome Back Barbeque.

"As a center of cultural and religious
life, Hillel serves Pitt’s Jewish population.
According to Community Service
Coordinator Debra Dwoskin, the group’s
mission is “to increase the number of
Jewish students involved in Jewish activi-
ties.” ’ .

Located in the Edward and Rose
Berrnan Jewish University Center on
Forbes Avenue, Hillel serves Jews of all

denominations. Completed in July, the ‘

Center attracts many interested students.

Some of its features are a lounge, an art
gallery and a kitchen that is kept kosher in
accordance with Jewish dietary laws.

Their student guide, “Derech,” states
that the Center “provides. . .social, cultural,
educational, community service and reli-
gious opportunities.” To do this, Hillel
sponsors year—round events such as Friday
night dinners, monthly bagel brunches and
a program called Birthright Israel.

The latter program, funded by a $210
million partnership, allows Pittsburgh_Jews
to visit Israel for free. Last year, 60 Pitt stu-

, dents toured the Dead Sea and Masada, an
ancient fort.

Other activities include religious ser-

vices on holidays and Shabbat, the weekly
day of rest. Hillel participates in religious
celebrations for the Jewish New Year, Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur, ,the Day of
Atonement. The organization also supports

on-carnpus observance of Kristalnacht, or

      
   
  

ts the l rolling  

the Night of Broken Glass, which com- "

memorates the night during the Holocaust
on which synagogues and other Jewish
centers were destroyed.

Upcoming functions aim to draw S

Jewish students. For instance, this month’s

of the “The Sirnpsons”’ Krusty the Clown’s
struggles with his Jewish identity. Also
scheduled are an ice cream social, a Jazz

' Support services supplement the spiri-
tual and cultural programs. The services
advise students on an array of subjects,’
from employment opportunities to where to

Hillel also works beyond the local

Jewish community. "Partnered with ‘sister

There they participate in Passover services

SHANNON, MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

New developments and new faces 
overran _ Student Government Board .
ofﬁces last night at the ﬁrst ofﬁcial meet— 

ing of the year.

Freshmen still eager from Sunday’s  1
activities fair nearly ﬁlled the Board’s E5

conference room as the members met for
the ﬁrst time since the Board’s six-minute
summer meeting last week.

President Jeff Alex began by praising
Erin Lindeman and Becca Normand’s
efforts as co-chairs of this year’s Arrival
Survival. '

“Move-in went a lot smoother this
year than it had in the past,” he said.

He also implored the crowd to sign up
to be a part of festivities at Heinz Field on

' Saturday before Pitt’s ﬁrst football game.

The largest American ﬂag in the world
will be unfurled to cover the whole ﬁeld
and SGB needs 300 volunteers to help
hold it up. '

“You can grab some grass,” he said,
telling students it would be their only
opportunity to legally set foot on the ﬁeld.
“Put it in your pocket.” _

‘ Alex also armounced the long-await-
ed arrival of Pitt’s Millennium Panther, a

. $72,000 bronze creation imported from
p Italy, purchased by SGB three years ago.

The panther, touted to boost school spirit,

“reports, telling students that SGB would

stay on top of student accommodations at
both Heinz Field and Petersen Events
Center. He also promised to continue
work on the Constitutional Review
Committee. '
Before the meeting was adjourned,
students were given the. opportunity to
raise concerns or questions in an open
ﬂoor discussion that many took advantage
of. Paul Cooley of Students in Solidarity

SGB off and running, but without committee chairs

urged the board to help University
employees unionize to avoid getting “shit-
ty wages” and to lobby Harrisburg to
avoid future tuition hikes. He also said
SGB should not endorse Friday’s
Millennium Panther unveiling because the
$72,000 panther only reassures Pitt stu-
dents that “the administration cares more
about cosmetic things than students.”

2 Alex responded by telling Cooley the
money had already been spent and that the
new panther would be a campus improve-
ment. The only other existing Pitt mascot
sits on the Panther Hollow Bridge.

Jay Dworin, political action chair of

the Black Action Society, also addressed '

the Board. He too asked SGB to reconsid-
er supporting Friday’s unveiling before
asldng the Board what it planned to do
about making sure committee chairs were
as diverse as Pitt’s student body.

Alex sighed before answering
Dworin, who is a former Board member.

“Let me catch my breath for this one,” t

he said.

p Alex reported that SGB is “looking
into an African—American cultural center”
and that the Board will “do everything [it]
can to fully represent the student body” in
terms of committee chairs.

Calling the meeting to its close, Alex
and the rest of the Board were immediate-
ly swarmed by freshmen waiting to apply
for committee memberships.

Year after year‘ , Student
Government Board elections result
-in the recycling of slogans and of

promises. Communication, action.

and results have been guaranteed to

the student body for as far back as .

Student Government records go.
Such ideas have become common
trends of each election. 7
In the past Student Government
Board members have acted as your
student representatives. They: have
been working for you and attempting

to do everything in their power. Past.

boards have been united ‘as a board
but separated by issues, race, reli-
gion, sexual preference or’ even
choice of soft drink.

Each board member has started
his or her term with specific objec-
tives and goals that he orshe specif-
ically feltwere important‘ to the stu-
dent "body. Many of those issues

have been worked on by that board‘

- member for an entire year. Problems
then arise when an incoming board's
vision is radically different from the
last, as this causes projects to die.

In addition to trying to fulfill

campaign promises and being a stu-
dent, board members must also
attend meetings, coordinate student
events and work to make sure stu-
dents are represented to the adminis-
tration. This does not_ mean that we
should look down on those who have
not been able or physically capable
of fulfilling all their promises.
Instead, it is important to try to learn
from them. T A

As an interim board member last
semester, not only was it difficult to
try to focus on our goals but we were
also faced with the challenge of a
shortened term. Last semester, the
2001 board worked not only to rep-
resent students but to work on pro-
jects as a group; Even though out-
side differences may have resulted.
in less unity, we worked together to
accomplish the goals that we had set
out to do at the beginning of our
term. _ . . 9

Last summer brought to you a
newly elected Student Government
Board, but it is aboard that will be
acting on similar principles as the
previous one. We _now have a full
term in front of us and are willing to
work together for you.

Our projects for the upcoming
year were laid out during our sum-
mer retreat and these goals will
become group projects ,— not only
amongboard members but also with
the assistance of the 10 committees
that fall under SGB administration.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

 

Who’s the man? Rod or David?

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Just four days away from his first
game of the season, head coach Walt
Harris is only worried about one thing:
his team.

“I’m not worried about East
Tennessee State,” Harris said. “I’m wor-
ried about us. I want to do a good job in
preparation, covering a big area.”

Sat11rday’s opener will also be the
first regular—season game played at
Heinz Field. Harris
plans to take his
team to the stadi-

Harris said. “We

tion. We’ve gotta make that place a

home—ﬁeld advantage and most impor-
tantly we have to sell out the place.”

Harris hasn’t armounced a starting

quarterback for S_aturday’s opener. He

watched two impressive scrimmages

from redshirt sophomore Rod
Rutherford and some mediocre practices
from senior David Priestley. As a result,
for the second year in a row, Harris
won’t announce the starter until close to
game time.

“I haven’t made a final choice on a
quarterback yet,” Harris said. “Priestley
should be the starter because he has four
years of experience but I haven’t seen
Priestley do things consistently enough
to be the starter. He responds better with

pressure.”

Who the quarterbacks hand the ball
off to is another question that Pitt has to
answer. Harris announced that true
freshman Raymond Kirkley would be
the starting running back Saturday.’

Kirkley impressed Harris during the
two scrimrnages and will be backed up

Dustin Picciotti, Pitt’s backup fullback
will not play Saturday due to a head

“We like Kirkley,” Harris said. “We
also like Polite. Ray [Kirkley] showed
us some things we liked, but we know
come Saturday he is going to be nervous
and excited.”

Pitt added freshman defensive back

Class of 2005 will witness greatness ,

Man, do I wish I was still a freshman.

Not only would I be able to revisit my ﬁrst experiences
of binge drinking and random hook-ups but
also I’d be able to witness my ﬁrst Pitt football
season and see the team win. And better than
that, expect to see winning seasons for the
remainder of my tenure. ‘

When I ﬁrst came to school, Pitt opened up
the season against Villanova I was so excited.
There was a cool Division ‘I program on my
campus and all I had to do was go around the
corner to watch the game.

Pitt beat ‘Nova that day. It was onetof two
wins that season and due to a case of mono (see
random hook-ups) and some woeful football, it

Granted, I thought Pitt stadium was awesome but it was by

The numbers weren’t impressive but experts all around
the nation praised one of ourown. That man

facelift to the program, adding dignity, hope '
and pride.

Pitt is now more than a program on the
rise. Coming off of abowl game last season
and an extremely impressive recruiting class,
this team is being built to compete nationally,

starting RB

Jovonny Ward of  Northwestern
High School to their roster last week.

Ward, considered the No. 22 defen-
sive back in the nation by Super Prep
magazine, signed a scholarship last year
to play with the University of 
this season. After the admissions staff at
Miami denied Ward access because his
high school equivalency scores were
received too late, Pitt picked him up.

Harris said he hopes that by having
three Miami players —— Antonio Bryant,
Torrie Cox and.Ward —‘ he will contin-
ue to pick up more Miami high school
players in the future.

' “He [Ward] comes from an. out-
standing high school program in Miami
Northwestern,” Harris said. “Hopefully
we are starting a Miami pipeline to
Pittsburgh with three Northwestern
products on our roster.”

Saturday’s game . against East

Tennessee State starts‘ at 6 p.m. at Heinz
Field. The festivities for the opening of
the stadium start hours before the game
and the postgame show includes a fire-

There are plenty of question marks for
Pitt on offense. Look for another two—head-
ed monster scenario at quarterback with
David Priestley and Rod Rutherford splitting
snaps. Rutherford impressed many during
summer camp scrimrnages and will receive
reps behind the center.

With 1,000-yard rusher Kevan Barlow

plethora of young running backs ﬁghting for
the starting spot Ray Kirkley, Mike Jernison
and Malcolm Postell are all vying for the top
role.

Lousaka Polite returns at fullback and

THE Pr1;T NEWS

might see some time at tailback. Fullback
Dustin Picciotti struggled throughout his
young career with concussions and his future
at this point is unknown. ~

The strength of the offense is at wide
receiver. Bryant led the nation in receiving
yards "per game last season and set a Big East
record for total receiving yards. He is joined
by Lamar Slade and RJ. English, who can
both make big plays.

The offensive line is a work in progress.
Bryan Anderson retnms to anchor the line at
the tackle position and Chad Reed is expect-
ed to start at center. With tackle Khiawatha
Downey suspended for the season, there is a
lot of competition for the open job.

The defense should be a real force this

season, with 10 of 11 starters returning.
Defensive end Bryan Knight leads the line as
he accumulated 11.5 sacks last season and
Amir Purifoy and Gerald Hayes lead the
linebackers. Hayes wrapped up 104 ball car-

Pitt could shake up Virginia Tech and Miami

improve last year’s 3-4 in-conference record.

VV1th the departure of Matt Hasselbeck,
who’s battling for a spot with the Baltimore
Ravens, Brian St. Pierre will quarterback the
Eagles. Although he has started just two
games, St. Pierre will be surrounded by
experience. .

William Green returns at rimning back
Green averaged more than 100 yards rush-
ing per game and scored 14 touchdowns.
Jamal Burke and Dedrick Dewalt return at
receiver. Dewalt caught 38 balls last season
for 676 yards and eight touchdowns.

The offensive line is a serious concem
as the team lost three All-Big East picks. The
team reclaims two experienced players with
the return of center Dan Koppen and tackle
Marc Colombo.

Defensive end Antonio Gray should be
fully recovered from a serious knee injury to
anchor the defense. The front eight is rela-
tively young but the secondary is experi-
enced and talented.

Comerback Lenny Walls returns trying

to exceed his six interceptions from last sea- .

son. Walls is joined by Will Poole who made
75 tackles last season.

West Virginia Sept. 1.

Pasqualoni needs to get ‘Cuse back ina bowl

Big East, page 12

ﬁrst time since 1994 and rumors are buzzing
that head coach Paul Pasqualoni must win
this season to keep his job.

The team lost its opener Sunday against
Georgia Tech 13-7 and things don’t get any
easier as the team travels to Tennessee to
take on a tough Vols squad. The problem for
Syracuse comes at ﬂie quarterback position
where Troy Nunes and backup R.J.
Anderson have both been inconsistent.

James Mungro will be the focus of most-

defenses as he averaged close to seven yards
per carry last season. Malik Campbell and
Maurice Jackson are starting at receiver.
Campbell caught 26 balls last season. Four
of ﬁve starters rettirn on the offensive line.

The defense is the real strength for the
Orangemen. All—American candidate
Dwight Freeney returns at defensive end.
Freeney led the Big" East with 13 sacks in
seven games.

James Clifton anchors the middle of the

defense, as the linebacker tallied 108 tackles
last season. Three starters retum to the sec-

ondary, including safety Quentin Hanis,
who had 55 tackles last season. '

The Orangemen face nine teams that
went to bowl games last season.

g wet Virginia

After 20 years of coaching, Don Nehlen
retired following the Mountaineers’ 49-38
victory over Mississippi in the Music City
Bowl. With Nehlen gone, it is up to Rich

Rodriguez to step in and take West Virginia,

to its ﬁfth bowl game in the last six years.

Rodriguez has some experienced play-
ers returning on offense. Avon Coboume, a
second—team All—Big East pick last season
and a 1,0()0—yard_rt1sher returns along with
starting quarterback Brad Lewis.

Lewis passed for 1,767 yards and 14
touchdowns last season and will have
Antonio Brown back to throw to. Brown,
who is the fastest player on the team, ﬁn-
ished fourth in the conference last season
with 721 receiving yards.

_ The defense will see nine starters return
and a new look, with the team going to an
eight-man front, which specializes at attack-

ing rtmning games. ‘

Temple

Bobby Wallace brings back 20 starters
as Temple will look to improve on last sea-
son’s 4-7 record and garner its ﬁrst winning
season since 1990. .

Even though this could be Temple’s last
season in the conference, the program has
made strides under Wallace and has a bran
new training facility. ’

Running back Tanardo Sharps leads the
offense, after coming oif of a 1,000—yard sea-
son. Devin Scott resumes quarterback but

the talent level drops off a bit after he and

Sharps are accounted for. Senior Greg
Muckerson is Scott_’s top option at receiver
as he has caught at least one ball in 22
straight games.

Four out of ﬁve starters return to the
offensive line and ﬂie defense returns 10
starters. 1

Junior defensive tackle Dan Klecko is
the top run—stopper on the line. Three seniors
retum to the secondary.

The Owls kick things oﬁ Thursday at

home against Navy.

Rutgers

New head coach Greg Schiano will
need to win just one conference game to
improve upon last season’s' 0-7 mark against
Big East foes.

To do so Schiano will have to depend-on
quarterback Chad’ Schwenk to replace Mike

0 McMahon, one of the school’s all-time lead-

ing passers. The Rutgers team which, if full
of young players, might also look to Ryan
Cubit to toss the ball. "

Last year’s team MVP Dennis Thomas

will return for his senior season. The tailback

rushed for 587 yards and three touchdowns
last season. Seven wideoutsretum from last

season, with Josh Hobbs and Aaron Martin .

leading the way.

Seven starters retum on defense. Senior
defensive end Torrance Heggie leads the line
as he ranked second among Big East line-
man with 64 tackles. He also tallied ﬁve
sacks '

Rutgers opens up the season Thursday

at Buffalo.
