Fallen firefig

NICK KR}\’FS,‘\S
Contributing Editor

A retired ﬁreﬁghter of the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau
stood at attention. When the command was made, he put
his hand to his forehead to salute. As the church bell tolled
long, sad rings. one after another in eight—second inter-
vals. bagpipes played “Amazing Grace.” The unidenti-
ﬁed man’s hand trembledas he held it at salute, his blue
eyes watering as the two caskets emerged from the
church. .

His tears didn’t come, but many of the thousands of
ﬁreﬁghters, police ofﬁcers. emergency medical techni-
cians and other rescuers, both professional and volunteer,
who attended the funeral mass, openly wept.

The services for fallen Battalion Chief Charles G.
Brace and Engine Company No. 3 Master Fireﬁghter
Richard A. Stefanakis at the St. Paul Cathedral in
Oakland was an emotional outpouring of respect and
love.

They died in the line of duty on Saturday, March 13,
while battling a four-alarm ﬁre at Ebenezer Baptist

“Its hard . . . it‘s always hard," said Jim Dolan, finan-
cial secretary for the International Association of Fire
Fighters Union Local 1. “l’ve been doing this for 37
years, and it's never easy.”

-Men died on the job

It was supposed to be a day of celebration and revel-
ry for city ﬁreﬁghters. As many of Pittsburgh‘s finest pre-
pared for the St. Patricl<"s Day parade Downtown with
food, drink and post—parade parties, others were called to
ﬁght a blaze at Ebenezer Church. A

Before the ﬁre was ﬁnished, it caused the roof of the

, 13 1-year old church to collapse into the basement.

Fireﬁghters at the scene assumed the ﬁre was dead,
and the church was safe to enter in order to douse "hot
spots” in the rubble and the bell tower, which still stood.
Brit while searching in the front vestibule of the church
and attempting to save what was left of the church’s arti-
facts. Stefanakis and Brace were crushed to death when
the bell tower collapsed; black smoke billowed into the

air such that even ﬁreﬁghters in the Downtown parade
could see. '

Besides the two fallen ﬁreﬁghters. twenty—seven
other ﬁreﬁghters were hospitalized with injuries sustained
at the church. Bishop Donald Wuerl, who presided over
the funeral mass at St. Paul's. had visited the injured ﬁre-
ﬁghters. Delivering the eulogy, Wuerl commented on
how these injured men, while still in the hospital, were
concerned more about their fallen comrades than for their
own health.

Many of .Ebenezer’s parishioners, who pledged to
rebuild their church, attended the mass. Reverend J. Van-
Alfred Winsett of Ebenezer Church led the funeral mass
in a prayer. during which he cried.

Brace. of Brookline, was 55 and had been a city ﬁre-
ﬁghter for 31 years. During that time, he held many posi-
tions and had been awarded commendation for outstand-
ing efforts. Stefanakis, of Allentown. was 51 and served
as a city ﬁreﬁghter for 30 years. He also received several
Commendations during his career.

Company bets students want tickets to Final Four

LAURA JERPI
Staff Writer

A Chicago—based company is betting that basket-
ball fans have a crushing desire to travel to San
Antonio and cheer on their favorite teams in the
Final Four and National Championship games.

In the past, such a trip might have been out of the
question, but The Ticket Reserve will try to turn stu-
dents’ dreams into reality — for a price._

According to_NCAA rules, each school in the
tournament must purchase at least 350 single-session
tickets for the first and second rounds, with the
option of purchasing an additional 200.

Though Pitt took the full allotment, the tickets
are already gone.

But students have another option. The Ticket
Reserve has bought the equivalent of 12 tickets per
team for the Final Four, 48 for the semi-finals and 24
for the championship game ’— and they’re looking
for students to buy them.

The process that takes place on their Web site,
www.ticketreserve.com, lets students follow a
process similar to buying and selling stock.
Customers purchase “event certiﬁcates” for any of
the 64 teams in the NCAA tournament. The___ initial
prices for the certificates vary between $25iand‘

$100, according to how likely The Ticket Reserve _

thinks the team is to make it to the Final Four.
The initial cost of a Pitt certificate is $50.

Having purchased the certificates, students are
allowed to sell their own certificates on the Web site
for any price they choose to set.

Of course, they also have the option of holding
onto them, too.

If a student’s team makes it all ‘the way to the
Final Four, the student can then present her event

certiﬁcate and purchase tickets at face value from.

The Ticket Reserve.

Duke, UConn, Stanford, Arizona, Louisville and
Kentucky are the only teams with initial. event cer-
tiﬁcate costs of $100. The Ticket Reserve keeps all
of the profit from the cost of the certificates, as well
as 10 percent of the commission for every resale.

“To me, the Web site is confusing,” sophomore
Kelly Wawrzeniak said. “Then again, I’ve never
heard of it before or had experience with a Web site
like that. After going through all the trouble of figur-
ing it out, I’d probably enjoy watching the game on
TV just as much.”

People are currently bidding between $50 and
$110 on the site for Pitt certiﬁcates to the Final Four
games, and sellers are asking $135 for.theircertifi’-
cates. Bidders are offering to pay as much as $75 for

Pitt certificates to the National Championship game‘

and between $175 and $220 to sell them.

1 , ' “I think it’s great that students can actually go

cheer and make some noise in the crowd for [the

' teams],” sophomore Curtis Atchison said, discussing

the idea that the‘Web site might allow more students

to be able toattend the games.

The Web siteprovided the ticket service for this
year’s Super Bowl game. The process went very
smoothly, company repres_entatives said. The mar-

‘ kets will open in April for the Indianapolis 500 and

next year’s Super Bowl. - ~

Meanwhile, most Pitt fans are out of luck if they
hoped to purchase tickets through the school. Most
tickets have been promised to season ticket holders
and the school’s top donors, though there will be a
limited number of student tickets available. ‘ W

The same situation applies if the Panthers make
it to the Final Four. , i

“I don’t think it’s fair, because the ‘top ‘donors
and seasonticket -holders get the top choice,” said

Pitt junior Mike Sweeney, discussing the distribution

of tickets for the NCAA tournament.

Although some of Pitt’s tickets went to the play-
ers’ guests, the vast majority were given away based
upon a points system, on 'a- pre-order basis. This is
done according to the order of the highest-ranking
Team Pittsburgh members. _

A small number of student tickets were sold
early Tuesday morning at the Petersen Events
Center. ‘ i V '

If Pitt wins its first two games, the University
will have to purchase 500 all—session tickets,‘ with
the option of purchasing 750 for the third and fourth

rounds. If that option arises, Pitt will likely purchase

all 1,250 tickets. _ - #

LORA WoonwARD
Staff Writer

Pitt students and professors ﬁlled the
Wﬂhain Pitt Union’s Lower Lounge for a
noon luncheon and panel discussion of the

‘Pittsburgh Public Theater’s production of

Italian satirist Dario Fo’s controversial. play,
“Accidental Death of An Anarchist”

Yesterday, Pitt Arts, the Pittsburgh
Public Theater and Pitt’s French and Italian
Department sponsored The Genius of Dario,
Fo: “Accidental Death of An Anarchist” —
a free, public‘ event —

“Itis arisky play,” Looney continued.
“It is _a farce about politics.” I ' "

The panel included two,Pitt professors
from the French and Italian Department,
Giuseppina Mecchia and Francesca Savoia,
as well as Kyle Brenton, Pittsburgh Public
Theater’s Resident Dramaturg, and actor
Robert Dorfman, who plays “The Maniac,”
the.1eading role in the play. i

' On Dec. 12,1969, a bomb exploded in
a-Milan bank, killing 16 people and wound-
ing 82 others. This event, the massacre of
Piazza Fontana, begins Fo’s play.

Milan police oﬁicers arrested Giuseppe
“Pino” Pinelli, an anarchist, and accused him

A of setting off the bomb..Pinelli was held in

police custody for more than two days
longer than the law allowed, and just before
midnight on Dec. 15,» Pinelli fell ﬁve stories
to his death. Fo’s play revolves around the
mystery of Pine1li’s death

Savoia then explained to the audience
how Fo’s circumstances in Italy shaped the
format of the play. F0 sought alternative
Venues for his politically radical works
because they were frequenﬂy censored and

he wanted to reach a more popular audience.

"F0 wanted to produce a theater for “counter-
inforrnation” against the Italian government.
“Anarchist” opened in 1970 in a work-
ing class neighborhood, Savoia said.
For “Anarchist,” Fo had to create a

“Anarchist” pays visit to
Pitt, along withfree lunch

script that had_to stay open to daily changes,
like the outcome of the trials and daily press
reports. Fo devised a plot with a central char-

- acter, “The Maniac,” who writes and

rewrites the script during the perfonnance.

Brenton then spoke of ﬂie challenges in
adapting Fo’s folk play to something to
which a Pittsburgh audience could relate.
“Anarchist” is a ﬁamework for a perfor-
mance, Brenton said

“Ihere is no authoritative text to go
from,” he explained. “We tried to excavate
the original text”

Pittsburgh Public Theater set the play in

Italy during the same time period as the actu-
al event, tried to ﬁnd the base of the text, and
then peppered in current themes.

Dorfman ﬁnished the panel )with an
energetic cry for all the students to come to
the theater and say, “We won’t pay!”

“I urge you all to become anarchists,”
Dorfman said _

Qian Zhang, an incoming Pitt graduate
student in Communications, attended the

event to get the background of the play '

before she went to see it last night.
I “I don’t want to have suspense,” Zhang
said with a laugh. _

After the panel discussion, Zhang said
she wanted to know about Fo, who received
the Nobel Prize for Literaturein 1997.

Annabelle Clippinger, director of Pitt

I Arts, said that events like this “help deepen

students’ perspective of the theater.”

Pitt Arts has also done panel luncheons
for performances at the City Theatre and
Kuntu Repertory Theatre. .

“Theatre is living literature,” Clippinger
said.

“ “Accidental Death of An Anarchist,”
performed by the Pittsburgh Public Theater,
is playing at the O’Reilly Theater through
April 4. Pitt Arts‘is offering $12 Cheap Seat
tickets for students. For more information,

-A somber remembrance

They came from ‘all over North
America, along with family, friends and
sympathizers, to pay their last respects to
their fallen comrades. .

Fireﬁghters of the City of Pittsburgh
were dressed in parade uniforms, many
with Carnations pinned to ﬂreir jackets and
wearing white gloves. City and county
police ofﬁcers and other rescue serviceper-
sons joined the crowd, many of them in
dress uniform. . . ‘

Fireﬁghters and rescue workers from
all over North Americaalso came to pay
their last respects. Fireﬁghters from as far as
Toronto, Dallas, New York City, Hawaii,
Cleveland, Washington,’ D.C., and Buffalo,
N.Y., were joined by Pitt police, state police,
and local ﬁre companies ﬁ'om Bethel Park,
Monroeville, Jeannette and Greensburg.

Hundreds of ﬁre engines, ladder trucks, '

command cars, ambulances and other res-
cue vehicles left Heinz Filed around 10 a.m.
for the procession down the Parkway
toward Oakland. They traveled down
Forbes Avenue, closing down much of

Oakland, their lights ﬂashing.

Fire companies from New Brighton,
Fair Oaks, Big Sewickley_Creek, Rochester
Township, Blairsville, Freedom, Chippewa,
Becks Run, Painterstown, and other ﬁre
companies joined the procession, many of
the trucks draped 'witl1 black cloth or
adorned with black wreaths. Some
Pittsburgh city trucks had black slashes on
their company numbers or logos, matching
the black bands that many ﬁreﬁghters wore

V over badges on their unifprrns.

"The vehicles then turned onto Fifth
Avenue, where the never-ending string of
parked vehicles started at Craig Street and
stretched beyond the Morewood intersec-
tion.

Meanwhile, many ﬁreﬁghters began
lining Fifth Avenue in ﬁont of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, some on sidewalks, others on the
steps in front of CMU’s » Software

procession closed off a stretch of Fifth

breeze blew through the gathering during
the dreary morning.

At 11 am, Pittsburgh ﬁreﬁghters led
the procession from Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial to St. Paul’s. The procession
moved down Fifth Avenue and under a
gateway made by two ladder trucks from
companies 4 and 24, the companies of the
fallen ﬁreﬁghters. Their ladders were
extended and crossed, and a huge American
ﬂag  down from them.

The ﬂag, according to Dolan, had no
signiﬁcance except for use as an ornamental
ﬂag for such occasions, but families of the
two fallen ﬁreﬁghters were presented, at the
funeral service, with American ﬂags, that
had ﬂown over Congress on the day they
died. —
Color guards carrying ﬂags represent-
ing the city, state, country, armed forces and
rescue workers led the procession. As the
procession came into view, bagpipes and
drums could be heard echoing from squads
that played solemnly, their green kilts waft-
ing inthe winter breeze.

— The procession and resulting crowd
ﬁlled every inch of street and sidewalk from
Dithridge to Craig streets. The sea of ﬁre-
ﬁghters chatted and waited, drinking coffee
and eating donuts provided by the Salvation
Army, until the hearses carrying the bodies
of the two ﬁreﬁghters arrived. Then the
crowd fell quiet, the silence broken only by
theidrone of news ‘helicopters above and the
ﬂuttering ‘of an American flag at half-mast

‘ across the street from the cathedral.

With the cofﬁns carried inside, most of
the crowd. followed, a solo voice singing the
hymn, “Here I am, Lord.” The remaining
crowd outside heard the service ‘via speak-
ers set up in front of the entrance to the
cathedral. 4

Inside the church, people ﬁled into the
doorways ﬂanked by pictures of the fallen
ﬁreﬁghters. On the left was Brace’s picture,

the words “In life, they lived life” above his ‘

picture, and on the right was Stefanakis’,
with the words “For life, they gave life.” On
the altar sat candles and fresh-ﬂower

‘ wreaths.

Wuerl spoke of how there is no fanfare
for ﬁreﬁghters when they are called to a ﬁre,
and how there “is no such thing as ‘a safe
ﬁre.” He spoke of solidarity that binds ﬁre-

-ﬁghters, how ﬂrey risk their lives for others,

and invoked the words of the Fireﬁghter’s
Prayer. ~ _

" “When I am called to duty, God, wher-
ever ﬂames may rage, give me strength to
save a life, whatever be its age...”

At the conclusion, ﬁreﬁghters streamed
out of the cathedral and gathered in the
street. The Emerald Society Pipe and Drum

D1‘llInS squads lined up on the steps in front.

of the church, and color guards lined the
street across ﬁom the cathedral.

A few bagpipes droned out “Amazing
Grace,” and the church bells tolled At the

' shout of a command, every ﬁreﬁghter stood

at attention and saluted. As the drum rum-
bling grew louder and the growing chorus
of bagpipes belted their song, many people
wept, some breaking into loud sobs.

The music stopped, and bugles played
taps. Several ear—piercir1g shots sounded to
salute the fallen ﬁreﬁghters.

The cathedral bell rang loud, but two
medical helicopters ﬂew low, their emer-
gency lights bright, and drowned out the
church bell with their powerful engines.

At another command, every ﬁreﬁghter
in attendance t_11rned away from the church

cargo was loaded during the closing cere-
mony. -

Eight motorcycle cops, their cycles

lined in a perfect row, started up. They»

started up in unison. Streams of cars fol-

   

lowed motorcycle cops down Fifth Avenue
and on to the graves. The remaining crowd
of ﬁreﬁghters followed on foot until they
reached Soldiers and Sailors, gathering once
again as they did before the service.

_ Laura Eckenrod, a private duty nurse
who had stood outside during the service,
went to pay her respects.

“I felt I had to be here,” Eckenrod said,
adding that she had once dated a ﬁreman,

-and also knew Captain Francis 

Deleonibus, one of the ﬁreﬁghters who
helped pull the bodies of the fallen ﬁreﬁght-
ers out of the rubble.

“It’s sad  it’s very moving,”
Eckenrod said. “They have nmg their last

Hazing proceedings undemocratic, unfair

Usually, fraternities get along
well with men named Jac Daniel.

In light of Vice Pﬁvost for
Student Affairs and —Dean of
Students Daniel’s recent obfusca-
tions concerning Tau Kappa Epsilon
fratern_ity’s suspension -— which
went against the judicial board’s
advice to simply put TKE on proba-
tion — that relationship might not
be amicable for long. E

Daniel’s decision to go against
the board’s recommendation, which
he made at Associate ‘Dean of
Student Affairs Birney Harrigan’s
suggestion, asdetailed in a March 5
letter, brings into question the
board’s entire purpose. If the board
has no final say on a fraternity’s
fate, why not call it an advisory
board? And if its sole function is
only advisory, why have it all?

Instead, Daniel has the absolute
veto over the board’s decision.
Moreover, the board’s proceedings
are not open to the public; nor will
Daniel comment on them, effective-
ly shuttering what should be an

' open process.

Accusations of hazing only fur-
ther fuel to the controversy sur-
rounding TKE and the University’s
treatment of the Greek system in
general. TKE was brought before
the board, but not because a pledge

or member had filed a— complaint.

, Dawn Wilson — mother of Brett
Wilson, a TKE pledge — sent a
complaint to former Sorority and
Fraternity Coordinator Anita Triggs
concerning events she considered
troubling. The Student Code of
Conduct and Judicial Procedures
states that “students and others”
may bring a complaint —- “others”
meaning anyone from a pledge to a
disgruntled parent. .

Brett, in fact, maintains that his
actions were voluntary, though the
Code of Conduct completely
removes a student’s right to decide
his or her actions: “Any activity as
described in this definition upon
which  membership in an organi-
zation is directly or indirectly con-
ditioned shall be presumed to be
“forced ”activity, the willingness of
an individual to participate in such
activity notwithstanding.” ‘

So Brett’s opinion doesn’t mat-
ter. Nor does the fact that he didn’t
bring the accusation. Instead, the
accusations of someone not present

at the scene of alleged hazing 

and not a member of the University
community —— was enough to neces-
sitate Triggs contacting, and ques-
tioning, TKE’s president Barron

never be good enough?

My roommate and I had
nicknamed a friend down

THE PITT NEWS

Witnessing truths that rang truer than the Liberty Bell  

that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this

Over spring break, I was fortunate enough, or per-
haps misfortunate enough, to visit Philadelphia.
Though the Flyers suck, the Eagles can’t win a big
game, and the Phillies ﬁnd themselves watching base-
ball’s postseason on the ‘couch just like the Pirates,
despite having a better team, modern Philadelphia has
one thing going for it — the treasure of
our nation’s history While it can be
claimed rightfully that Philadelphia
owes that one good thing to historic
accident, it still is a good thing, and it
was enough to make the trip rewarding.

In a complex world, events that
deﬁne the current global conﬂict and
seemingly need no context -—— like
September 11, 2001, the war in Iraq and
now the devastating March 11 attacks
on commuter-train passengers in
Madrid, Spain — were given context. In
the old Pennsylvania Statehouse — a _
building that once dominated the Philly skyline, now
dwarfed by modern civilization — where our nation’s
founding documents, the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution were drafted, much became clear.

Though the words of both documents are power-
ful as text alone, there is something special, almost
magical, about encountering the physical history
underlying them. Hallowed words become even more
hallowed when on hallowed ground. A

The universality and forcefulness of the rhetoric
of our founding documents rang truer than the Liberty
Bell did before she cracked for good. “We hold these
truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal
and are endowed by their creator with certain inalien-
able rights ...” “We the People  ”

That the same men who decided they would rather
hang together than “surely hang separately” in signing

the Declaration of Independence were able to return to
Independence Hall and draft our Constitution is both
striking and awe-inspiring. .

But where can this experience take me, other than
an overly dramatic civics lect11re?

That’s what I wondered as I entered the National

Constitution Center, a state—of-the-art facili-
ty that truly captures our Constitution for .the
marvel that it is. It embeds the Constitution
in history, showing its stable and lasting
nature, while simultaneously demonstrating
how the Constitution is a living document,
both through amendment and interpretation.
America’s greatest philosopher, John
Dewey, remarked that life is a mixture of the
“precarious and the ’ stable.” Our
Constitution conﬁrms what Deweyiphiloso-
phized. ’

Amidst all the raw emotion and over-
whelming experiences, I realized that what I
was encountering was a larger sense of history. This
trip raised my awareness of our nation’s history to a
level it’s never been at before -—— and if that happened
for me, I’m sure it would for countless Americans just
like me. .

,With this realization, I could start. putting the
pieces of the puzzle together. Events like September
11, 2001, and the tragedy in Madrid, made a lot more
sense now than before. History, not the nightly news

or talking pundits, provides the best context in which

to see these issues.

This is what I saw.

With respect to the war on terror and especially in
light of the recent massacre in Spain, I couldn’t shake
the words of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.
“It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before us  that we here highly resolve

Friday, March 19, 2004

nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom,
and that government of the people, by the people, for
the "people shall not perish from the earth.” '
These words, a more than ﬁtting tribute for the
dead at Gettysburg, the dead of September 11, 2001,
and now the dead of Madrid, must be acted upon. Like
the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln’s words
ring universally as a moral that cannot be equivocated
or argued with. There is little doubt that, in the war on
terror, the terrorist enemy wishes to eradicate democ-
ratic government from the earth.'Our battle must not

A only be to ensure that such a government doesn’t “per-

ish from the earth” as Lincoln put it, but to do our best
to extend the liberty of democratic government to the
oppressed of the earth. a ' ,

' If I may slightly refashion Lincoln’s words for
today’s world, it wouldgbe to make them read? “That
government of the people, by the people, for the peo-
ple shall ﬂourish andspread upon the earth.” , _.

“We the People”, have a voice much louder than
we did when the Constitution was written. It is time
for us to raise that voice in unity with the victims,

their familiesand the citizens of Spain; It is also ‘a I

time we cannot forget September 11, 2001 or our
own history in this pivotal election year. If “We the
People” renew our understanding of, and commitment
to, the universal values that guided this nation’s

_ founding, we would ﬁnd a unique opportunity.

We would find the opportunity to allow President
Bush to reclaim the mantle of Lincoln for the
Republican Party and restore to America a moral
authority that is embodied in our founding documents
and that died with Lincoln at Ford’s theater.

History must live in more than Philadelphia.

trip, braving the elements, not a soul
aware of where we were. I felt like I
was going to get to see what happened
after the ending of “Good Will
Hunting,” life finally becoming the
movie it should be. Maybe my room-
mate and I were merely Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern, supporting charac-
ters in someone else’s epic, but I liked
the role. It meant that I wasn’t the one
whose heart was on the line.

Reality set in as we entered cam-
pus. I’d like to tell you that what hap-
pened next was an emotional scene,
with Sun Kid kissing his dream girl to
a standing ovation from a crowd, a la
“Never Been Kissed.” Alas, he went to
her room to talk, while my roommate
and I were left to make awkward con-
versation with two of her friends about
just how psychotic our friend was.
After all, who would ride his bike 90
miles to tell a girl he met for 20 min-
utes, “I love you”?

As I nodded my head in agree;
ment, I noticed some of the DVDs lin-

ing the girls’ shelves: “Serendipity,”

“When Harry Met Sally,” movies
where the lead goes great distances to
profess his feelings. These girls had-
undoubtedly watched them, hankie in
hand, dozens of times, wishing their
ﬂesh-and-blood beaus could compete

V with fantasy. What they ‘yearned for

was Sun Kid.

Sun Kid didn’t get the girl. Behind
his back, we mock him for his behav-
ior. But as we sat eating at Sheetz at 4
a.m., I couldn’t help but think that Sun

Kid was a failure whose act should be 

followed. I wish I had the guts to fall
ﬂat on my face with such gusto. If

what he did that night wasn’t enough,”

maybe he was playing to the wrong
audience.

Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind

Starring: Jim Carrey, Kate
Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Tom
Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah
Wood ‘

Directed by: Michel Gondry
si‘n2n_9r‘1/2 '

“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind” is in the running for the odd-
est, bulkiest title of a film to come
along in a long time —— and the film
isn’t, at first, much more accessible
than its title.

Starting’-at point D on the film’s
timeline, “Sunshine” then goes back
to point -B, then to point A, finally
returning to point D, with point C
being the point that holds everything
together. It’s a film that progresses
manically, yet methodically — what
else would you expect from a Charlie
Kaufman script? — ,and it’s pulled
off marvelously.

Joel (Jim Carrey) is a hapless
hipster-type longing for love. And,

he finds it, of all places, on a Long '

Island train, bound for Montauk,
N.J., the day he decides to forego his

normal life for an impulsive
excursion. Clementine (Kate
Winslet) is a spastic mess who
catches Joel’s eye as goes from
place to place in Montauk. _On the
train back to New York City, they
finally talk to one another —
uncomfortably and awkwardly —
and hitting it off. I

But something’s off. She feels
like she’s met him somewhere
before, and he feels astrange pull
towards her. Enter Lacuna, an
institute that erases bad memo-
ries. We discover that both Joel
and Clementine had the proce-
dure done to erase one another
from each other’s memories prior
to their meeting on the train out
of Montauk.

What follows is a, surreal trip
through the mind of Joel and the
meaning of relationships, as we

the “Sunshine” of my life

 

are transported back to the day he
has his memories erased by the
Lacuna crew Dr. Howard

Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson); Stan‘
(Mark Ruffalo), the technician; Mary
(Kirsten Dunst), the receptionist with
some secrets of her own; .and Patrick
(Elijah Wood), the creepy, perverted
intern.

Despite the initial difficulty in

COURTESY Focus FEATURES

getting involved in the film’.s narra-
tive, “Sunshine” pulls you in slowly
and with a purpose. Our discomfort
and wonderment in what’s happening
on-screen mimics Joel’s as he goes
through his life in the outside world
and living in his memories.
‘Kaufman’s script
deserves a lot of credit for
the success of the film.
Some of the dialogue could
be right out of a Neil
LaBute script, and the film
has so many quirks that it’s
undeniably Kaufman. Two
of the most inspired of
Kaufman’s scenes are
when Joel is shown as a
child, but with the body of
Jim Carrey. Seeing a grown
man being bathed in an
oversized kitchen sink is
funny enough, but that gets
topped by a grown man
wearing pajamas and a
cape, getting beat up by
real kids.

. The work of director
Michel Gondry cannot be
discounted, though. The
numerous shots of Joel
walking through the streets
of New York in a fog —
with Joel being the only
thing in focus, everything
else is fogged out — and
the scenes in which pieces
of Joel’s memories are

COURTESY Focus FEATURES

shown being erased are inspired.
Impressive also is that these
moments never get stale or feel gim-
micky. A good portion of the film is
dedicated to these scenes and shots,
and no matter how often we see
them, they always feel fresh.

But the real revelation is Jim
Carrey. He’s shown before that he
has some acting chops in “The
Truman,Show,” “Man on the Moon”
and “The Majestic.” In “Sunshine,”
however, he turns in his most intro-
verted and affecting performance. He
never goes over the top, and,‘as a
result, you forget you’re watching
Jim Carrey. And that’s fine, because
this isn’t a Jim Carrey movie; it’s an
ensemble piece where cast members
act their ass off. Elijah Wood, for
example, is so creepy as the lascivi-
ous intern that he destroys any possi-
bility of getting typecast as the self-
less hero hobbit.

Ultimately, the quirkiness of the
plot, characters, writing and direc-
tion gives way to a simple tale of
love found, gone wrong, lost, and
given a second chance. It’s a film
that’s genuinely touching and full of
feeling.

“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind” might not leave you eternally
sunny, but it does resonate well after
the end credits. It would take a lot_
more than the technology of Lacuna
to erase it from your memory.

You won’t want to say “Goodnight” to this production

“Say Goodnight Gracie”
Through March 28

Starring: Frank Gorshin
Directed by: John Tillinger
Byham Theater

(412) 456-6666

wfrikstrsfr

From the moment “Say
Goodnight Gracie” begins, with
fog, dramatic lighting and George
Burns (Frank Gorshin), circa the
time of his death, shuffling on
stage, the Byham Theater becomes
the vaudeville house it began as. In
fact, it’s a stage that Burns himself
once graced during those golden
years of entertainment.

But what takes place onstage
isn’t technically a vaudeville show.
lt’s a one—man act that’s a very-
much—refined version of something
you might have seen on those
stages. However, this isn’t your typ-
ical one-man show —— you’re not
going to see a Margaret Cho—type
performance of imitations and
stand—up comedy. Rather, Gorshin,
whom people should know as the
Riddler from the ‘60s CBS
“Batman” TV show, transforms
himself into the famed Burns for an
hour and a half, recounting his life,
career and love with Gracie Allen.

With sparse set design — the
only things on the stage are two
tables, one 1

telephones, and a bench — Gorshin
can rely only on himself to carry the
show and the audience. And-he does
this with inspired gusto, class, skill
and ease.

Burns takes us on a trip through
his life, beginning with his youth in
New York, living in a tenement too
small to support his large family
and working at various odd jobs.
The one that made the greatest
impact was a candy-making job.
While stirring ingredients in the
basement of a candy shop, Burns
and his two co—workers would sing
to eliminate the boredom of the job.
They noticed people watching and
listening to them through the base-
ment window. When they were
done, those people threw change at
them. An entertainer was born.

He left the candy shop for the j _

exciting, hard-knock life of_work-
ing in vaudeville. Going from one
partner to another, one act to anoth-
er, and so many name changes, it
looked like he’d never make it.
Until he met Gracie. With her,
he had an act that took him from the

smallest stages in New York City to

the grandest ones, then to radio, the
movies and television. But most
importantly, she took his heart. He
fell in love with Gracie Allen, in
one of the most storied romances in
entertainment history, and never
looked back.
It’s at the end of his life when
we meet Burns, wandering through
a limbo he compares to being in
Buffalo, N.Y. As he tells his story,
auditioning for God for a spot in
Heaven so that he can see Gracie
again, Burns reenacts songs he
sung, dances he danced and rou-
tines he performed with Gracie.
But Gracie never appears
onstage. Instead, it’s
the disembodied
voice of Didi Conn
providing the other
half of Burns and
Allen.
This isn’t
some sort of cheap
-gimmick. Because
Burns is stuck in
limbo, he wouldn’t

be able to see
Gracie —-—
V remember, he
wants to get
into Heaven to
meet her — so

it makes sense
to only hear

her voice.
God, judging
the audition,
surely wants to
hear Gracie’s

so do we. This piece of the produc—’ I

tion works wonderfully. Only hear-
ing her voice -— from time to time,
we also see. a still image projected
on the wall behind Burns — makes
the show all the more affecting.
Also interspersed throughout
“Gracie” are clips from old Burns-
Allen films and TV shows "and

Gorshin—Conn reenactments of old

Burns-Allen radio shows. This pro-
vides a sort—of relief for Gorshin,
breathers in his nearly 90-minute-
long monologue, and it gives the
audience more insight into the story
Burns is telling.

But these clips also highlight

just how spot—on Gorshin’s perfor-.

mance is. Burns' traits —- the man-
nerisms, the stutterings, the inflec-
tion, the fshuffling, the way he says
“Gracie” in a drawn out way then
dwells on the name for a beat before

‘continuing'——- are all incorporated

into Gorshin’s performance. He
absolutely disappears in t\heBurns
persona. Only from time to time
does Gorshin come out —— when he
smiles, the light and his angle
onstage occasionally catch him in
the right way as to make you say,
“Look! The Riddler!” Thankfully,
though, those moments are few and
far between. ‘ »
“Say Goodnight Gracie”-is a
magical show, taking the audience
on a trip through a life and love

’’unparalleled in modern-day enter-

tainment. The magic thatvradiates
from the stage as Frank Gorshin
transforms into George Burns and
the Byham back into the old Gayety
vaudeville house is overwhelming;
This is a show that is one of the best
to come through Pittsburgh in a
while, and it will absolutely’ knock
your socks off.

If you’re not a fan of either

musicgenre, branch out a little and
widen your musical tastes. At the
very least, support a _Pittsburgh-

recognition for their last album.
Readers of In Pittsburgh

However, whilethe band’s range
of musical style is rather vast, the
members’. vocabulary within each
song doesn’t . travel that far. The
lyrics aren’t that. deep, but contain
some verses that we can all relate to.
For instance, does the song title
“Better Stop Drinking” sound famil-

stop drinking/I’ve been drinking for

While deeply country— and
blues-sounding, the fourth track on
the album puts a little bit of a kick
into the cauldron. “Stuck in’ the
Middle” is strangely punk, perhaps
to the liking of guitarist Fran

New York punk scene from the ‘

groups Fingers and the Features.
Track five, though, goes back to

“Dawnof the Dead” comes back to haunt audiences nearly 26 years later

“Dawn of the Dead”
Starring: Sarah Polley, Ving
Rhames, Jack Weber, Mekhi
Phifer V
Directed by: Zack Snyde
sfniﬁ/2

The 1978 George Romero version
of “Dawn of the Dead” holds a special
place in the hearts of Western
Pennsylvanians. Not only was its pre-
decessor, the I968 classic “Night of
the Living Dead,-” filmed near
Pittsburgh, but “Dawn” itself was
filmed in Monroeville Mall. This may
be why it’s so hard to judge the remake
without referring to the original. It’s
like seeing an interesting piece of the

area’s history whored off to
Hollywood.
Fortunately, the new “Dawn”

stands on its own, with a variation on
the plot and characters. Not saying that
it is without ﬂaws —— in fact, the film is
riddled with them — but it still offers
some worthwhile entertainment.

The film opens in suburban
Wisconsin, where Ana (Sarah Polley)
comes home from a long day of work
nursing bite wounds at the local hospi-
tal. The next morning, she wakes up to
her family and neighborhood trans-
formed into undead Cannibals, intent

known for his work with the indepen-
dent horror studio Troma and the 2002
live-action “Scooby-Doo” — adds a
lot of details which would appeal to a
new audience. The bumbling, disori-
ented zombies of the original “Dawn,”
for example, are now faster and more
animalistic, very much like the rageful

menaces of “28 Days Later.” The__cine-.

matography and rough, grainy’ look of

“28 Days.Later” also appears ‘in this
new version, making you question 

this isn’t just trying to be the.American

copy of the 2003 British import.

As in many horror ﬁlms of this
nature, there is a need for some come-
dy, which “Dawn” provides at a level
of silliness. The comedy becomes
overwhelming at times though, espe-
cially when much of the horror is
ruined by misplaced bits of cheesy dia-
logue and unneeded comic relief. Ving

_Rhame__s, for one, appears in his usual
badass role,_ delivering, patented , one-

liners at every turn, ‘while another
character, a sarcastic womanizer, pulls

the action down with his smarmy,
-unfunny comments. «

.Plot and dialogue aside, the new

“Dawn” takes advantage of its big

budget, with chillingly realistic make-
up and special effects. The look of the
zombiesis revamped “with bloody,
infected wounds and decomposing
ﬂesh, along with the special effects
that feature everything from exploding
heads to an orgy of car crashes. This
alone is enough to satisfy and horrify
any viewer. A ‘ _

All around, the film is a worthy

effort’ from first-time director Zack

Snyder. Although he still can’t‘com-
pete with the inventiveness of George
Romero, hopefully. he and the film’s
writer, Gunn, can come up with some-
thing of their own, instead of leeching
off the ideas of others.

JoE MARCHILENA

Central Florida could be in for a long night.
For just the fourth time this season, the Pitt men’s

' 1 b'asketbal.l team will step on the court after losing its

previous contest -when the Panthers take on the

'Knights ‘in the ifirrst round of the NCAA Tournament

tonight’. 'a
V _ In each game following a loss, the Panthers have

- come out‘ strong and looked impressive. After losing

to Connecticut, Seton ‘Hall and Syracuse during the
regular "season, Pitt defeated its next opponent by an
‘average of 18 points.

With lasteSaturday’s loss in the Big_East

_ Championship, Pitt (29-4) realizes how urgent it‘is to
bounce back_ one more time. '

'_“Now, if you lose, you’re gone,” said freshman

center Chris Taft-, who was named the Big East

Conference Freshman of the Year. “I hate losing.
That’s going to ‘drive me throughout the tournament.
I’ve got a feeling that, come tournament time, every-
body’s going to be clicking.”

' In order to‘ advance beyond the first round, Pitt is
going have togenerate more offense, having scored
fewer than 65 points in four of it§last six games. The
Panthers averaged 69.5 points a game during the sea-
son. In two of those four low—scoring games, Pitt shot
less than 40 percent from the field, and in the second
half of their last game, the Panthers shot just 39 per-
cent, allowing UConn to come back from a 12-point
deficit. A

Pitt will also need to improve its" play on the
boards. The Panthers were out—rebounded in all three
tournament games last week, including a 41-33 disad-
vantage against the Huskies. '

. Sophomore Panther diver Dennis
Nemtsanov captured first place on
the 1-meter board with 608.4 points

to earn his second trip to the NCAA

Championships at Zone ‘A’ Diving
Pre-quals at the United States Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md.

Despite an injured shoulder that
has limited his training the past
month, Nemtsanov qualified for the
platform and the‘ 3-meter board
events with scores of 431.6 and
492.4, respectively. ’

“He did phenomenally well,”
head swimming coach Chuck Knoles
said, “He has always been able to
come through Withbig performances
at big competitions,”

At the Big East Championships
last month, Nemtsanov became the
first non-Miami diving champion
since 1991, leading Pitt divers to a
total of 143 points.

‘Junior Panther diver Devin
Aikins almost joined Nemtsanov at

the nationals with a second-place.

finish and a 443.1 score on the plat-
form event. Aikins finished 15th in
the 3-meter competition and 13th in
the one-meter competition.

Senior Matthew Schwartz ended
his Panther career with a seventh-
place finish in the 3-meter with

488.85 points and a ninth—place fin-
ish in the 1—meter with 536.75
points.

Adam Natishyn had scores of 218.5
in the 3-meter along with 470.05 in
the 1-meter to finish 25th and 18th

Nemtsanov’s nagging injuries, -feels
it will be quite a success if he can

injuries, I don’t know what to

Georgetown fires Esherick after losing season

BRENNA MCGEE
The Hoya (Georgetown U.)

(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON Georgetown
University ﬁred men’s basketball head coach- Craig
Esherick Tuesday. The announcement was made by
President John J. DeGioia in a statement released by
the Office of Communications.

“After careful deliberation, I have decided that it
is time to make a change in leadership in our men’s
basketball program,” he said.

Esherick told The Washington Post he was sur-
prised by the decision. ’ A

“I certainly did not see it coming. I know we did-
n’t have a great year, and I know what happens to
coaches [when they have a bad year],” Esherick said.
“I’ve been part of the university for a long time, and
I’ve been part of an awful lot of good things that have

happened to the university for a long time.”

Esherick recently completed his ﬁfth full season
as head coach. The Hoyas’ season ended last week
when the team was eliminated in the first round of the
Big East Tournament. ‘

This year, the Hoyas ﬁnished the season with a
nine—game losing streak and a 13-15 overall record.
This losing streak is the team’s longest since the
1971-72 season, the year before John Thompson was
hired. The team’s record is also the worst the program
has had since joining the Big East for the 1979-80

   

season. ‘ —

As the Hoyas struggled this season, Esherick’s
performance was heavily criticized by students and
alumni. Chants of “Fire Esherick” resounded at Hoya
home games, and a rally was scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon in Healy Circle to voice dis-
pleasure with the current state of the basketball pro-
gram.

, Despite the criticism, Esherick had been conﬁ-
dentin the security of his job and recently asserted, “I
will be here next year,” and told his critics to “stay
tuned.” L ‘

“I ain’t going anywhere. I may be herefor anoth-
er 30 years,” Esherick told The Associated Press on
March 5. “I love my job. It’s been a tough year.
There’s nobody that has a job that can’t say they
haven’t had tough years. It’s dishonest and inaccurate
for anybody to evaluate me with the standards of a
professional basketball coach.”

The firing of Esherick seemed to be a drastic
reversal of position by the Georgetown administra-

~ tion. Before the season began, Esherick received a

contract extension through 2009, and as recently as
March 3, DeGioia
Esherick. I. ’ .

“I believe that this season’s men’s basketball
team and our new class of recruits [hold] a great deal
of promise,” DeGioia told The Washington Times. “I

Athletic Director Joe Lang had also been very
public in his support of Esherick. '

Esherick succeeded Thompson as head coach in
1999, and had_a 103-74 overall record during his
tenure. He led the Hoyas to a Sweet 16 appearance in

I 2001, but the team has failed to make the NCAA

Tournament in the last three years. I

~ The Hoyas narrowly qualified for the Big East 3
‘ Tournament this season through the back door — a

last—minute Miami loss to West Virginia.
Georgetown, which lost to Boston College, 68-57, in
the tournament, had never lost in the first round. ,

The Hoyas had been invited to either the NCAA
Tournament or the National Invitation Toumarnent
for 29 consecutive years, the longest such streak _in
Division I basketball. Because the team, finished
below .500, it was ineligible" for the NIT. '

“I am dedicated to sustaining that tradition of
excellence whichimeans a greatdeal to our universi-

ty community and the many fans of Georgetown bas— .,

ketball,” DeGioia said. “We are deeply committed to

maintaining national competitiveness with the lead-
ing programs in the Big East and the country.”

DeGioia said a national search for a new coach A

would begin immediately. _

Notre Dame knocks off Purdue in first round of NIT action

MATT LOZAR
The Observer (U. Notre Dame)

(U-WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind, -
Rivalry games are known for Weird
occurrences, and 38 years between
games featuring Notre Dame and
Purdue didn’t stop that trend.

In front of a split Joyce Center
crowd Wednesday night, the Irish
overcame making only six second-
half field goals to defeat the
Boilermakers, 71-59‘, and advance
to the second round of the NIT.

“I don’t know if we had a better
atmosphere in there a1l.year, and
we’ve had some great games,”
Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said.

As the Irish struggled from the

field in the second half — not scor- ‘

ing their first field goal until a
Chris Thomas jumper with 10:35
left in the game — they unexpect-
edly rode the perfect free throw
shooting of Rick Cornett.

Cornett, a 64 percent free throw

‘shooter, made all eight of his

attempts ‘against the Boilermakers
en route to scoring a career-high 16
points. .

“Free throws are abig part of
our game, and they are something
we really need to depend on
because we get fouled a lot,”

iCornett said. “Obviously, I was

happy to go out there and make my
free throwsj’ 1‘ '
Cornett’s
Wednesday was his second straight
game with a career high in points.
He has given the Irish a steady low-
post presence they. have missed
since losing Torin Francis to injury
in the middle of February. .
.“Rick Cornett comes in, and we
make post feeds, and we get
fouled,” Brey said. “Our team has

A kind of reinvented [itself] acouple.

of times.” .
Purdue presented the Irish with
a tough, physical matchup that the
Irish usually see in Big East con-
tests. The Boilermakers didn’t dom-
inate the glass, but did pull down 12
offensive rebounds compared to
only six for the Irish. ’
“They area tough team. That’s
Big East basketball and Big Ten
basketball at its finest, right there,”

Irish forward Jordan Cornette said.
“We were really clashing and bat-
tling hard. I tip my hat off to them.
They are a tough bunch of competi-
tors, and we are lucky to ‘pull
through today.”

The Irish struggled from the
start, except for Chris Quinn, who
scored the team’s first 11 points of
the game and kept Purdue from tak-
ing. a big early lead.

Later in the first half, the Irish
finally started making their shots,
ending the half by connecting on
eight of their last 12 shots to hold a
39-30 lead at the break.

In the second half, the Irish lost

their offensive rhythm and made
only six field goals in the entire 20
minutes. But their free throw shoot-
ing kept them in the game; they
made 16Vof 18.

“It’s a weapon for us,” Notre
Dame guard‘ Torrian Jones said.
“You don’t get the truth of the game
by just looking at how many bas-
kets you score. If you put the
defense in.a compromising position,
they are going to foul you, and you
can get the two points. How good
we. shoot the ball from the free-
throwline, that’s a plus for us.” I

And the weir_dest thing _in the
game may-have happened in the

closing seconds. Walk-on Greg Bosl
swished a half-court shot for his
first career field goal. E -

But on .a night many Notre‘

Dame and Purdue fans have been
waiting for since l966,‘the Irish
were able‘ to do enough down the
stretch to get the win.

“We knew they were going to
bring their Purdue fans to pack the
place, and we knew that our fans
would be behind us supporting us
like they did all year,” Jones said.

- “We knew the atmosphere would be

electric, and I think the game kind
of reflected how the atmosphere

ther orwar oi drivesiitth ask on A oston College
 defender during the Big East Tournament.

Panthers to play in Milwaukee,
Wis., in first round of tourney

Men, page 15

UConn limited the Panthers to

just 11 offensive rebounds, keeping,

Pitt’s big men off the boards and
keeping it from getting second-
chance points. v

“You always need to get the big
guys going,” point guard Carl
Krauser said. “In any level of bas-
ketball, you want to, because if you
have good big guys down low, a lot
of things can work through them. If
you have great interior passers like
we do, it makes the game easier.”

On the other side" of the ﬂoor,
the Knights (25-5) are led by three
seniors — forward Dexter Lyons,
who averages 18.5 points a game,
center Roberto Morentin, who aver-
ages 13.4 points and 6.8 rebounds
per game, and center Josh Bodden,
who scores 11.2 points and grabs
5.6 rebounds per game.

All three players shoot ‘better
than 50 percent from the field, and
Lyons" shoots better than 45 percent
from behind the three"-point line.

“Their big guys do pass the ball
well in a different sort of way,” said
Jamie Dixon, Pitt’s head coach.
‘‘They’re very skilled. They can

step out. I think they use their pass-
ing ability to go inside. All three of
them can score on the block. It’s a
good team. They play well together,
and you can see that they’ve played
with each other for a while.’’

Central Florida defeated
Jacksonville, Belmont and Troy
State in the Atlantic Sun tourna-
ment to advance to the NCAA
Tournament for the third time in
school history, and Taft and Krauser
know they can’t look past I this
game. - ,' V

“If you look past it like that and
you think you’re going to beat
someone, Central Florida could
come in and shock the whole
world,” Taft said. “We just have to
out there and do it game by game.”

“Anytime you get counted out
before the game starts, you have a
chipone your shoulder,” Krauser
added. “You want to go out there
and prove to the other people out
there that you’re a legit team in the
tournament and you can play. As
you get older and you get to play
this collegiate game, you realize
that you can’t look forward to other
games like that, because that’s
when you could get beat.”
