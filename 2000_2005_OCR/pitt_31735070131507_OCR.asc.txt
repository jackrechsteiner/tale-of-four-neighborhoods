Sex safety taughtby YEP

Staff Writer

Some say the key to safe sex is‘

education — that, and how to use
non-microwaveable saran Wrap.

On Tuesday night, about 25
people gathered in classroom .1P56
in Posvar Hall to participate in a
safer-sex workshop and to learn
about different forms of sexual con-
traception and their proper use.

The Rainbow Alliance co-spon-

sored, the free-to-all event, along

with the Black Action Society and

the Campus Women’s Organization,‘

as part of Pitt’s World AIDS Week.
Members of the
Empowerment Project gave demon-
strations and advice about using

Competition between Kiva
Han and Starbucks brewing

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

In the pastdecade, the Starbucks
Coffee Company has gone from oper-
ating 272, shops to operating 7,225. It
is estimated that four new Starbucks
open every day, and at the end of
November, the Starbucks -on the cor-
ner of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street
was one of those daily four.

The new Starbucks presentsfierce
competition for the locally owned
Kiva Han coffee shop, which is locat-

ed across the street at the intersection. S

Kiva Han is expanding its space and
menu.
Some people may think that open-

ing stores close to independent shops

and feeding off their clientele is a
common strategy of Starbucks.‘

But Valerie Carlborg, community
spokesperson for Starbucks, said
there is no such strategy.

“We believe Starbucks represents
one choice in the Pittsburgh commu-
nity,’-’ Carlborg said. ‘

She added that customer feed-

back, particularly in the form of sug- D

gestions offered to the franchise’s
hotline, determines Starbucks"choice
of locations. ' '

John Mutchka, owner of Kiva
Han, is not upset about the new
Starbucks.

“I’m not bitter in any way about

them being here,” Mutchka said."

“That’s part of the business. You deal
with competition.”

Mutchka said that Kiva Han- is
unique, and that there are enough dif-
ferences between the two for both to
survive. He added that strong ties to
the community and activist groups,
and a dedicated, passionate staff make
Kiva Han unique. ‘ ‘

“Every single personhere has a
passion for something outside that
they bring in,” he said. “That’s one of
our hiring strategies: to hire people
based on their willingness to‘ bring
their passions here and let their pas-

sions grow.”

He feels that employing social
activists will help Kiva Han survive.
“Everybody that works here has been
involved in some group or activity
that has put them in an underdog posi-
tion, and we are all used to‘ banding
together and fighting for what we
think is right,” he said. “We are a
small, independent coffee shop, and
we have large goals, and we are fight-

ing for them.”

Mutchka is also reassured by the
fact that a Kiva Han has already gone

head-to—head with a Starbucks. A sec-

ond, smaller Kiva Han opened last

year fu-rtherwest on Forbes Avenue,
near the intersection of Forbes and_ '
Meyran ‘avenues, only a block away
from another Starbucks.

Kiva Han patrons said that they

would stick with the shop despite the

new, big-name competition.

Owen Carmichael, a Kiva Han
patron, said he dislikes Starbucks’ ’

location strategies.

“I don’t like that, the way they
spread their tentacles everywhere,” he
said. O

Carmichael, who is from San
Francisco, said that he was displeased
to see many Bay Area coffee shops
run out of business by Starbucks.

Fellow Kiva Han patron Bob

Gradick is also partial to locally"

owned businesses.
' “I like to recycle money locally,”
Gradick explained.

Gradick agreed with Mutchkathat
Kiva Han and Starbucks will not nec-
essarily bump heads. .

“In the South Side, there are three
or four coffee shops, and they’ve all
found their niche,” he said

Kiva- Han also plans to grow, in

spite of the new Starbucks. Recently, .

Mutchka purchased the corner store
next to Kiva Han, which was previ-
ously the gift shop History. He plans
to make it part of arevamped Kiva

Penn State offering students free use of Napster

NIKKI SCHWAB
Staff Writer

Pennsylvania State University is
trying to discourage students from
illegally downloading music files
—— by providing a legal way to do it.

This spring, the University will
provide the newly revamped
Napster service to all students liv-
ing on campus by using Ihoney from
the students’ $160 information tech-
nology fee.

“I don’t think it’s fair that every
student has to pay for it when I
know that not everyone is going to,

   
   
   

or even be able to use it,” Penn
State senior April Vassilos said.

Vassilos and other students are
concerned because the service is
only available to the student body
living on campus and since the new
version of Napster will not work on
computers with a Windows
Millennium Edition or Macintosh
operating system.

Students will be able to listen to
a limitless amount of songs; howev-
er, if they want to keep the song on
their computer’s hard drive, they
will have to pay a 99—cent fee per
song.

   

“I think that Napster is a good
idea because it keeps students from
running into very costly lawsuits,”
said Sonya Scholz, a Penn. State
sophomore. “My friend from a dif-
ferent school was sued for $70,000
because’ she downloaded the wrong
song off of Kazaa.”

While students at Penn State
will have Napster in the spring, Pitt
currently has no intentions to fol-
low in their footsteps.

“Before we would do anything
like that, we would consult ‘the stu-
dents to see if they were interest-
ed,” said Jinx Walton, a senior

To curtail students’ usage of
popular file—sharing programs, such
as Kazaa or iMesh, Pitt has adver-
tised the fact that file sharing is
illegal. '

According to Walton, the num-

ber of “tickets,” or violation
notices, given to file—sharing stu-
dents has decreased this term.
_ “This year, there were fewer
than there" were last year, and we do
have posters in the residence halls
and pamphlets available every-
where,” Walton said.

Walton explained that the
recording, movie or software indus-
try contacts the University when a
computer on the network is in ,viola-
tion. Pitt then tracks the machine
committing the violation and issues
a ticket. .

The University sends an e—mail
and a letter to the student, instruct-
ing them toremove the copyrighted
material from their computer within
five days, then to contact the

Technology’ Help Desk. Students

who fail ‘to contact the Technology
Help Desk in the allotted time peri-
od have their network port —
Internet connection —— suspended.
Repeat ‘offenses can result in legal
action against the student.

Walton said Pitt had no problem

. with legal file sharing._

YEP shows condom strength

based lubricants were the safest and
most comfortable form of lubricant.
,“Vaseline may be in a lot of
erotic fiction,” one YEP member
said. “But don’t ever use it during
sex; I don’t care how hot it is.”

After the demonstrations, YEP
members took questions from the
audience.

When asked why YEP gave out
LifeStyles brand condoms and not
Trojans, the response was that,
while Trojans are the best—marketed
condom, they aren’t_necessarily the
highest-quality ones.

To demonstrate the‘ quality of
the LifeStyles condoms available to
those at the session, and to dispel
the possible arguments by some
men that they_’are too small, YEP
member Jarred Reichard took one
from the table, opened it, and pro-
ceeded to pull it over his fist and

‘ wrist without any breaking or tear-

ing. ~

_ “No penis is too big fora con-
dom,” Reichard said triumphantly.
“And if it is, that person needs to
seek medical attention immediate-

ly.”

Another person asked if lamb-
skin condoms were a good alterna-
tive if someone had an allergy to
latex.

YEP Outreach Coordinator
Lyndsey Sickler answered that such
condoms have “pores”similar to
human skin, and that, while they

may act as birth control, they still-

allow for the transmission of dis-
eases and should only be used by
people in a “committed relation-
ship.” She recommended instead
that latex-allergic people use
polyurethane-based condoms as an
alternative.

In addition to free available
condoms, there was also»: informa-
tion on how to get involved with the
various sponsoring organizations as
well as events and Web sites,
including www.stophiv.pitt.edu,
related to preventing AIDS.

“Events like this are important,

because [sexually transmitted dis—_'
cases] are most common among

young people,” Reichard said. “And
there aren’t a lot of opportunities
for them to receive information
about how to prevent it in the

straightforward way we’re convey- ,

ingit.”

Worker ownership wanted at shop

said. “But the big thing is the menu.”

Mutchka said that he would like
to eventually alter the way the store
runs.‘ * '

“In time, we would like to make
this a worker-owned and’ -operated
coffee shop,” he said. “Worker own-
ership is what we want to make a
model of here —+ a traditional busi-
ness gained through a traditional way
— through [Small Business
Association]. money that gets refi-
nanced and given out to workers who

to promote empowerment.” .

Pathetic Wal—Mart DVD player debacle

On Black Friday, shoppers in
Florida set a new low for disgusting
consumerist behavior.

Wal—Mart was offering DVD
players for less than $30. Shoppers
lined up early that morning, awaiting
the 6 a.m. opening. At the sound of
the alarm signifying the start of busi-
ness, the first person in line, a 41-
year—old woman, was trampled. She
lost consciousness and had a seizure.

Wal—Mart, in a stunning display of
wrongheaded “care” for the victim,
has offered to hold a DVD player for
her until she is well enough to come
to the store and cough up the cash. A
Wal—Mart spokesperson told ‘ the
Associated Press that, “we are very
disappointed this happened. We want
her to come back as a shopper.”

Nowhere has Wal—Mart expressed
concern for the victim’s health. No
sympathy was even offered. Their
main concern? Getting her back as a
shopper. How obscene.

Wal—Mart likes to maintain a
wholesome, folksy image, despite
being a corporate behemoth. They
refuse to carry music with racy lyrics,
for fear of being offensive. What
could possibly bemore offensive than
a woman getting trampled?

For the most part, the woman’s
fellow Wal—Mart customers were
oblivious. They continued in their
mindless mass grab for the cheap

electronics.

What a pathetic indictment of the
American materialist mindset. Human
beings stomped on another human
being, all in the name of a good deal.

Everyone involved ought to be
ashamed. Everyone who scored a
DVD player that day should feel sick
every time they watch a movie. The
mob mentality leading to this human
disaster is an embarrassment.

Christmas has, for the most part,
transformed into a secular holiday, for
better or worse. Still, divorced of its
religious significance, the holiday is
supposed to be about love and caring,
about giving and being a little kinder.

The Wal—Mart debacle proves that
Christmas is no longer infused‘ with
even general goodness. It demon-
strates that the only thing that mat-
ters, in many minds, is stuff.
Americans are drowning in stuff, and
now, apparently, we are willing to
maim each other, all in the name of a
little bit more stuff.

As sad as it seems, Wal—Mart
should have foreseen at least a little
chaos and been prepared to deal with
dollar-grubbing, bargain-crazed shop-
pers.

Of course, they should not have
expected the revolting display they
got, but a little mindfulness over bar-
gain-basement pricing might have
prevented such a hideous incident.

Gay presence in the media
helpful, stereotypes harmful

The bourgeois media now has gay
stereotypes on almost every channel you
turn to. With the creation of “gay—posi-
tive” shows like “Will & Grace” and
“Queer Eye For the Straight Guy,” you
might think everything is

side of San Francisco.

The average American television
viewer is more than happy to laugh at all
these boys’ antics and quick wit. ‘Yet
most viewers are hard-pressed to actual-

just ﬁne for the queer com-
munity. Well, think again.
Despite their entertain-
ment value, I wonder how
beneﬁcial such shows truly
are. Shallow-thinking queer
people are quick to point out
that TV has decreased

 

ly discuss the inequalities
queer people experience in
society. After the
Massachusetts ruling on gay
marriage, media polls claim
that the majority of
Americans oppose gay mar-
riage. Maybe the poll should
ask “Do you think Jack

should propose to VV1ll if the

into every living room in Colummst I bet those numbers would be
America. Give me a break — different.

hate crimes against queer Americans Stereotypes, as true as they may be

have been on the rise in the last 10 years.

First off, not all queer men — and I
do say men, because the media could
care less about queer women — are lumi-
naries in the ﬁeld of aesthetic success.
My roommates will be the first to admit
that some of my comrades and I should
lobby for an episode called “Queer Eye
for the Queer Guy.”

This show is nothing more than con-
sumerist propaganda wrapped up in a
big, rainbow ribbon. Every episode is
ﬁlled with shots of the stars’ favorite
stores, where the straight fashion dilet-
tantes buy their ungodly priced merchan-
dise. And the viewing public rejoices at
this unabashed capitalist promotion. This
is not gay taste, but rich urban ﬂavor
considered a necessity.

“Will & Grace” is admittedly a
funny show. I will not deny that I occa-
sionally watch it. What disturbs me is
that, for many people, this is “gay.”
There is nothing wrong with being ﬂip-
pant and extravagant, and I see nothing
wrong with enjoying the show as a work
of ﬁction. But is this how it is viewed?

We are not all upper—rniddle class
white men with successful jobs and few
worries of discrimination. Queer people
—- like everyone else— still have to
worry about HIV, a topic “Will & Grace”
has never addressed, along with a host of
other concerns that come with living out-

for some of us, do not help anyone. I hear
the claim that it is a celebration of diver-
sity within the community. This is a
lunatic’s remark. When all. of the shows
have a consistent character type, all the
media does is narrow the American pub-
lic’s actual experience of the queer com-
munity.

These stereotypes allow for an unre-
al person to be formed in every living.
room in America. If we would actually
try to diversify character types of queer
people for the average American, maybe
we could make some progress. But I
have yet to see a show talking about the
lives of rural queer people or even an
episode where someone says “I don’t
really like the club; I think I will stay in
and read.” That, of course, is a formula
for bad TV.

I am not trying to say that these
shows should be barmed from the air, but
we should try to reinforce the position
that they are not the ﬂagships for repre-
senting the queer community.
Stereotypes may break a few barriers in
the short run, but only create much larg-
er schisms for the future.

of the Radical Homosexual Agenda, Josh
has decided to move on to new business.

p that, and our hairdresser and
interior decorator and fashion
designer jobs. And, ;OK, you

until they can offer me a

more enticing stereotype.” I thought all

this in my head, then posted it on my blog.

That was before the gay conspiracy
ﬁnally got a real marketing department
and went on a public relations blitz. I don’t
know whose closet they’d been hiding in,
but suddenly, the gay army was out in full
force, toppling the rule of law and order
and piping their recruitment propaganda
into our schools and churches. And didn’t
they look fabulous! They’ve put the style
back in “altemative lifestyle.”

It started with that Supreme Court rul-

ing that encouraged sodomy. “Sodomy in

the streets, and may the heavens fall!” pro-
claimed Antonin Scalia from the steps of
that venerable institution.That’s when I
knew I better get on this big, gay—loving
bandwagon.

I called up my token gay friend,
Travis. ‘"1“ravis,” I. said, “Are gay people
androids?” Travis laughed and told me no,
but that’s exactly what you’d expect an

' android to say. It would take more than

that to convince me. .

So they conquered TV. From “VV1ll
and Grace” to “Queer Eye for the Straight
Guy” and back, the lisping, Prada—wearing
fashionistas, with their sassy hair gel and
catty retorts —— the whole spectrum of gay
identity was there. And people loved it. I

_thought about my freshman roommate,

who’d said, “I’ll tolerate gays as long as
they don’t act gay in public.” That went
out years ago; now thetolerant position is

not occupy yourselves with a fashion.

show, or put on a Cher CD and prepare for
a long wait, I hear you have your own
pornography now; perhaps you could
while away the hours productively. Or
work on your recruitment videos. '

So that’ll be our bargain. You all con-
tinue to be hilarious caricatures with sharp
tongues and razor wits, while secretly plot-
ting to undermine the very fabric of our
social order. In exchange, we’ll “tolerate”
you by letting you be on television and be
the butt of lisping jokes — no pun intended.

I think, in the end, we all have to pitch ‘

in to spread peace and understanding. I’m

- just trying to do my part by getting the

word out about the awesomeness of gay

' project to alleviate racial tension by treat- .

On the day I became aware of my deceased
battery, my dad and I went to at least three jewel-
ers, each one shying away in terror and recom-

mending that we visit a kiosk in the mall.

At .a loss for. options, we approached the
kiosk. I handed the honored, timepiece to a young
girl. After a lot of hammering, banging and fuss- '
ing, the girl confessed that there was nothing she

could do.

To make a long story short, the watch has
been taken to a muchbetter jewelry store, which
repaired much of the additional damage inﬂicted
by the kiosk employee. The watch has since been

shipped ‘to some frustrated guy with a German
accent living in New York. . .

And this is all for a battery.

this holiday season, don’t go for something rep-

utable and ﬂashy like a Swiss Military watch.

The Puzzle People: Memoirs of a
Transplant Surgeon

Thomas E. Starzl
University of Pittsburgh Press
2003

79r7’.‘r1/2

Although organ transplants are relatively com-

monplace in our day and age, there was a time when ,

procedures such as kidney or liver transplants were
only dreamed about by doctors and their extremely ill
patients. Thomas E. Starzl, who is the Director of the
Transplantation Institute at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, was one of the founding fathers in this
life—saving branch of medicine, and has written a mem-
oir detailing how organ transplants evolved from prim-
itive beginnings to the cutting-edge technology used
today, and also discussed the people instrumental to the
ﬁeld’s development. .

First, the reader learns about Starzl’s own life. His
father owned a semi-weekly newspaper in I_.eMars,
Iowa, the small town in which Starzl was born and
raised. However, his father was not content to just pub-
lish a family-run paper in a’ small town in Iowa He
dreamed of bigger and better things, and secretly wrote
dozens of science ﬁction stories at night, when every-

one else in the house was sleeping. He was also a gift- .

ed inventor, always on the prowl for ideas that would
make life easier. It was only after his fat_her’s death,

however, that Starzl realized his fatl1er’s genius and’

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

Puzzles of a surgeon T   O

N learned to respect his ideas.

After his early years, Starzl goes on to describe his
education. He attended Northwestern University and
Johns Hopkins University, where his interest "for the
new science of transplantation was piqued. He began
doing research projects on dogs and how they respond-
ed to liver transplantation. Needless to say, it took
many years — and even more failures — before he
discovered the plethora of requirements needed in
order to achieve a successful transplantation. The read-
er can identify with every setback and every. failure,
and ﬁnally rejoices when the ﬁrst liver transplant is
realized.

This memoir is fast-paced and entertaining. It pro-
vides a glimpse into a world most of us don’t even
think about, but which is instrumental in saving the

lives of thousands of people every year. At times, how- .

ever, Starzl’s writing is too far removed from the read-
er and sounds more like a textbook, full of medical
terms that the average person couldn’t even hope to
understand, than a personal memoir. Also, the sheer
number of people involved in making the ﬁeld of trans-
plantation possible is dizzying, and Starzl has a habit of
giving the reader each person’s personal history. This
aspect of the novel can be overwhelming at times.
Except for these few shortcomings, “The Puzzle
People: Memoirs of a Transplant Surgeon” is an inter-
esting read. Pick itiup over winter break and discover
this fascinating, ever-evolving branch of surgery Dr.
Thomas Starzl was vital in bringing to life.

MEMOIRS OF A
TRANSPLANT SURGEON

  

Hey, man, where’s the mole?

trying to grab the smoking hottie’s hands with
tears  down their faces. .

The highlight of the album is “Live it up
Tonight” because of the deep lyrics. The song is
about not worrying about our differences and liv-
ing every second of our lives up to their fullest
potential. It starts off by saying, “We’re. strong.

The man with the mole is back — or wait»——
is he? There is controversy surrounding the
marked man. Did Enrique Iglesias get rid of his
signature mole? In fact, he did. Ig1esias’s doctor
informed him that his mole could be cancerous, so
Iglesias went under the knife, and now he is a
whole new man with a brand-new album, titled
Seven. I

Seven ‘is very similar to his past albums. The

songs start out slow and then pick up with a rump-

shaking beat. There is always a break in the song
where Iglesias busts out some heartfelt crooning,
then the music picks up once again, and you’re
reassured that the beat has not left you and Iglesias
has not left the same old formula.

A few power ballads, such as “Addicted” and
the Spanish version of the same song, “Adicto,”
pepper the album. You can almost see the teen
girls reaching their arms out in a crowded concert

We’re weak. We die. We’re straight. We’re gay.
We’re bi. We’re black. We’re white.” I

“You Rock Me” is an upbeat, good-time song
in which Iglesias sings about every variation of the
way that somebody could “rock you all night
long.” This is a fun song that could be blasted in a
clubbecause of its rhythmic drum line.

There is a woman singing on the chorus of

“Roamer,” which gives it a different feel than the‘

rest of the album. The song is pretty chill and is
about not knowing where you ﬁt in and trying to
establish yourself on your own. The main point of

‘the song is that it’s good to be on your own, but

sometimes it can be lonely.
Seven is an interesting album with some
poignant moments. At the same time, it lacks orig-

inality and a certain quality that some of his more '

popular songs in the past have had.

Ask her fans. She wouldn’t be here
today if it wasn’t for them. The
amazing story of how she raised the
money to produce her CD proves

that she tru-ly has her strongfan base ,

to thank.’ * » 

Hornik was saving money to”

recor_c_1_ her first full—length album,
and she even had a friend ready to
produce it. «She saved the money she
made from working as a bartender
within walking distance from the
World Trade Center. After Sept. 11,

_ 2001, the bar suffered financial dif-

ficulty, and her income was dramat-
ically reduced. When she expressed
to her fans how she was going to put
off the album because of financial

difficulties, sheasked for any. dona-

tions they could give. In return, she
promised them free, signed copies
of the CD. The response she got was
overwhelming. She received over
$10,000 —— all from her fans. With
that money, she produced the criti-
cally acclaimed Say You Do.
Hornik’s Natalie Merchant-like
vocal style is a soft touch of soul
and heart. Shestarted songwriting at
the age’ of 14, with musical inﬂu-
ences rangingifrom Carole King to
Johnny Cash to Stevie Wonder. She
studied voice for three years and

 

dreamed of being on Broadway —— a.

dream that crashed when she dis-
covered she couldn’t do ballet. She
began studying songwriting with
Mitch Chakour, a former piano
player for Joe Cocker, and went on
from there to produce two of her
own EPs and, eventually, her full-
length Say You Do.

Marly took second place in the
2001 _Georgia Music Industry

‘Assioc'iat’io‘n:’s-iannual songwriting »

contest. She has also been show-
cased in _the}_Philadelphia Music
Conference, Nashville New Music

ics,but fans’ money speaks louder
then words. Now it’s your turn to

about.

In 1981-, AC/DC screamed out,
“For those about to rock, we salute
you!” Twenty-two years later, some-

_body finally got saluted. The other

set of mates with guitars from
“down under,” Jet, have packed their
suitcases and, like their name
implies, hopped aboard a fast—mov-
ing' sky vehicle to invade America.
From the sound of things, they
brought their record collection with
them.

Somehow, Jet has chemistry’d
up a formula for molecularly bond-
ing modern New York City indie
rock with‘ the good vibrations ﬂoat-
ing off your dad’s classic rock radio
station. The direct influences on Get
Born are off the radar: The Who,
Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Iggy
Pop. ’ ,

This record doesn’t just bolt out
of the gate, it straps a rocket to the
horse’s ass. The opening number,
“Last Chance,” might as well have
been usedto open a Faces concert.

Taking off from ilie classics

In the second slot, “Are You Gonna
Be My Girl,” is so bloody catchy
that my incessant foot tapping and
head banging prevented me from
finishing this sentence until after the

song was completed. If you’ve been

scratching the fur off your forehead
trying to figure out what the name of
that bleeding beautiful song is in the
new iPod commercial, well ponder
no more.

The rest of Jet’s debut plays like
the old jukebox in the back of the
bar. “Look What You’ve Done”
weeps like a ‘60s Paul McCartney
piece. I swear someone beat up
Keith Richards while he was record-
ing Let It Bleed and stole one of his
guitar riffs for “Move On.”
“Timothy” crossbreeds Tommy with
Superman and gives birth to a whiz-
bang ballad. Even the better part of

the modern era is admired on “Radio I

Song,” which sounds like the guys
threw on The Vines’ Highly Evolved
and merely improvised from there.
Despite Jet’s innate ability to
imitate the best qualities of the best
music, they should not be confused
with the local tribute band that plays
Tuesdays at the pub. Jet has its own
sound: a sound finely honed using
the tools of the past. Angus Young
and company would be proud.

A “Bent” group of short story “Offerings” available only on Amazon

Bent Offerings

Double Dragon Publishing

2003 ‘
~aa

It takes an intelligent mind, perhaps some-
what warped, to come up with a novel like Mark
Sutton’s “Bent Offerings.” If you’re a diligent
reader and can read a novel that has as many
twists and turns as the movie “Memento,” then I
recommend that you to go to Amazon.com. .

Why not Barnes .& Noble or another book-
store? Because you can’t buy this book inistores.
Most of you have probably never heard of

Sutton’s books because the press doesn’t devote
much attention to him and his works — yet.
Keep in mind, though, some of the most extraor-
dinary pieces of literature are those that go
unnoticed. I wouldn’t necessarily go as far as to
call “Bent Offerings” extraordinary in a phe-
nomenal, life—changing way, but it’s definitely
more than ordinary. ,

Though “Bent Offerings” may seem a rather
difficult read for a person who enjoys reading
Rolling Stone articles, it may even give the sci-
fi guru a headache.

Beginning with what’s thought to be a naked
psychotic man cursing in the streets, the novel
soon takes many different turns.

As stated on the book’s cover —— somewhat
“bland” in Sutton’s words — “‘Bent Offerings’

  I   andexperience  

is just that, a collection of short stories within a
novel that seem a little off, skewed to the left,
bent over backwards ...” "

This collection of unusual short stories
begins, “A rugged well—musc1ed man simply
seemed to appear near the center of a very busy
intersection, startling all around, screaming sal-
vation or damnation to heaven-on-high and
everybody who would listen, graspingat all who
dared pass by. He was out—and-out naked.”

‘ The naked man, later to be nicknamed
“Bones,” wakes up in a hospital room. And then,
throughout the rest of Sutton’s novel, the reader
is forced inside the head of Bones who continu-
ously has dreams that take place in, the future.
Each character Bones comes across in the novel
plays a role in his disturbing dreams, getting the

~ reader mixed between what is reali-

ty and what is fiction.

_ If you have the time to involve
yourself in a novel that is going to
take up plenty of it to unravel its
secrets, then forget about"going to a

novel. And

Sutton’s someday,

maybe Sutton will get the press he
needs that will save your printer’s
paper. Until then, “Bent Offerings”
is just a click away.

Pitt loses in cross-tn rivalry

MATT SORTINO
Staff Writer

In a game that put City of
Pittsburgh bragging rights on the
line, Pitt’s Women’s basketball team
would be ve_ry proud of their play in
the second half Wednesday night
against Duquesne. However, the first
half was a different story. '

Despite the fact that the Panthers
(1-2) outscored the Dukes 52-38 in
the second half, behind career highs
from forward Latoya Kincaid, who
had 25 points, and guards Amy
Kunich, who scored 21 points, and
Katie Histed, who tallied 16 points
and five assists, Duquesne held on
for a 92-80 victory, its fourth in the
last five meetings against the
Panthers.

Head Coach Agnus Berenato was
very disappointed in her team’s play
in the first half but was extremely
encouraged by the effort in the sec-
ond half. Following the contest, she
admitted to maybe putting a little bit
too much pressure on the fact that
this was a “city rival” game.

' “I really felt like there was a lot

of pride at stake”, Berenato said. “I
felt like we were prepared, but I still
have tremendous hope, and we will
come back at it tomorrow.” '
Candace Futrell, who came in

game for Duquesne (3-3), poured in

streak —— after starting the season
with two straight wins.

Even though Pitt seemed to be
blown away in the first half, it
regrouped in the locker room and
came out playing its game in the sec-
ond half. Both Kincaid and Kunich
felt the need to step up and score in

Pitt survives sluggish start in victory

RYAN FALooN

The Pitt men’s basketball team didn’t have to trav-
el very far in its second away game of the season, but
it somehow managed to show up late. .

Despite a slow start and falling behind to cross-
town rival Duquesne 24-22 at halftime, the Panthers
(5-O) made the necessary adjustments in the second
half, allowing them to pull away to defeat the Dukes,
59-45.

“We knew it was going to be a tough game,” Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “The guys really stepped
up in the end like they always do. ’

“We’ve got smart guys and we’ve got tough guys,
and that’s really what helps us win games.”

Duquesne (1-2), got the crowd into the game imme-
diately when Jon Pawlak knocked down the first shot
of the game to give the Dukes an early 2-0 lead. '

Maddox not a

big improvement

     

. 

For all of you Steelers fans who thought
that quarterback Tommy Maddox was the
answer —— how do you like your “quarter-
back of choice” now? ’

Pittsburgh Steelers fans were so eager
to kick Kordell Stewart to the curb after
Maddox replaced him last season and led
the Steelers to the playoffs. Maddox was the
story of the year —— the sequel to St. Louis
Rams’ quarterback Kurt Warner’s perfor-
mance in 1999. Well, Stewart is probably
looking pretty appetizing right now.

One of Pittsburgh’s major issues was its
troubled otfensiveline. Failing to re-sign
oifensive tackle rWayne Gandy was a mis-
take, and when Marvel Smith went down
with an injury, the Steelers were in trouble.

This is where Stewart’s mobility is a
bonus, and the man is not an inadequate
quarterback. Head coach Bill Cowher

-‘thought that Maddox and the passing

oﬁense was going to be the new formula in
Pittsburgh, so why was there a need to keep
Stewart? ‘

It is very diﬂicult to contain Stewart in

the pocket, whereas Maddox is a pocket

passer and a sitting duck Therefore, when
the pocket collapses, defenses know where
they will ﬁnd Maddox.

In actuality, Cowher made two errors

— he also got away from traditional Steelers
football. Pittsburgh is traditionally known as
a football team ﬂrat plays smash-mouth
fooﬂaall. Over the years, it has been able to
nm the ball elfectively and play tough
defense. .
Cowher apparently wanted to change
this philosophy when he benched nmning
back Jerome Bettis in favor of Amos
Zereoue. In essence, he put his faith in two
unproven, back-up players that probably are
destined to be career back-‘ups.

Thinking Zereoue could be a potential
feature running back in the National
Football League was not a foolish thought,
seeing as how Zereoue has shown ﬂashes of

_ being able to accept that responsibility in the

past. The mistake was naming him the out-
right starter when Bettis obviously had more
left in his tank. '

Wrestling places third at Mat Town Invitational

JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

Drew Headlee and Zachariah Doll
finished first in their respective weight
classes, and the Pitt wrestling team
turned in an impressive third-place fin-
ish at the Mat Town Invitational last
Saturday.

Eight out of 14 Panthers placed in
the tournament, and Pitt finished with
126.5 overall points, which put it seven
points aheadof fourth-place Ohio and
just a half of a point behind second-
place Penn State. comeﬁi won the Mat
Town Invitational with 156 points.

“It was a very good performance,”
head coach Rande Stottlemyer said.
“We have improved every time we’ve

competed. We’re so young -— we had_

to earn some respect [at the ‘touma-

ment].”

One of the most respectable perfor-
mances in the tournament was turned in
by Doll, who has missed Virtually all of
two seasons due to shoulder surgery,
then an anterior cruciate ligament
injury. Doll overcame adversity and
took ﬁrst place at 165 pounds.

He was the ﬁrst seed in his weight
class, so it may not have come as a
shock to some that he won, but
Stottlemyer knows how difﬁcult it is to
come back from injury, let alone two of
them.

“They say it’s a little like riding a
bike but it’s a lot different; trust me,”

. Stottlemyer said about how hard it is to

wrestle well after a long layoff.

V Headlee was the other ﬁrst-place
finisher for Pitt, taking home the top
spot at 125 pounds. Headlee, seeded

7th in his bracket, opened some eyes by
defeating the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th seeds on
his way to the title. Stottlemyer was not
-surprised about Headlee’s performance.

“We knew that he was certainly
capable of winning,” Stottlemyer said.
“That kid doesn’t want to lose.”

WrestlingReport.com named
Headlee the Eastern Wrestling
League’s Wrestler of the Week for his
achievements.

Sophomore Ronald Tarquinio near-
ly added a third ﬁrst-place ﬁnish for the
Panthers at 141 pounds, but,lost to top-
seeded Scott Moore of Virginia, 8-6 in
the finals and settled for second place.

Three Panthers took third place in
their weight classes including freshman
Matt Kocher, at 149 pounds, sopho-
more Francis Iorﬁdo, at 174 pounds
and senior Josh Birt, at 197 pounds.

Kocher improved his record to 12-3 in
his ﬁrst season of collegiate wrestling.

Rounding out the place winners for
Pitt were‘ sophomore Justin Nestor, who
placed seventh at 157 pounds, and
senior Travis Shirley, who placed sixth
in the heavyweight bracket.

Stottlemyer was pleased that his
wrestlers did not give up when they
were eliminated from winning their
brackets.

“When you come back and take
third and sixth place, it shows a lot of
character,” Stottlemyer said.

The Panthers are next in action on
Dec. 19 at the Beast of the East College
Tourney in Newark, Del., and
Stottlemyer likes his team’s chances
the rest of the season.

“If we stay healthy, we’re going to
be pretty dangerous,” Stottlemyer said.

The Pitt volleyball team split a pair of matches this
weekend at Community ‘Banker’s Classic in Stockton, Ca.

‘ In their ﬁrst matchup, the Panthers took on Oregon State

and lost a 3-1 decision. They followed it up with a domi-
nating 3-0 sweep over Alabama-Birmingham in the conso-
lation game.

Oregon State 3 Pitt 1

The Big East Champion Panthers (25-5) went into"

‘Friday’s match against Oregon State winners of ﬁve
straight, but struggled out of the gate against a Beavers
team that needed to win their ﬁnal two matches to have a
chance to get into the NCAA Tournament.

“I think, in the Oregon State match, we weren’t really
prepared mentally,” head coach Chris Beerman said. “They
plarmed like it was life or death, and we just kind of played.
I think we learned a lesson from that.”

Oregon State (16-16) was nearly ﬂawless in game one, -»

hitting .564 with 23 kills and only one error in 39 attempts.
The Panthers recorded a .344 percentage, but ultimately
lost the game 30-22.
Pitt came roaring back in game two, forcing the
Beavers into 13 errors and a -.022 hitting percentage, while
cruising to a 30-16 win. But the Panthers’ momentum led

them nowhere, and Oregon State battled their way to 30-26
and 30-25 wins in the ﬁnal two games.

“All it is, is a lesson, because you go into the NCAA-

Tournament, and you really can’t have those kind of let-
downs,” said Beennan. “In some ways, it was a good loss
for us, if there is such a thing.” a ‘

Outside hitter Wendy Hatlestad led the way -for the
Panthers with 30 kills, a season-high as well as a match-
high. She also led the team with a .373 hitting percentage
and recorded eight digs.

Middle hitter Megan Miller and outside hitter Sarah
Rollman also recorded double-digit kills for the Panthers.
Miller had 12 kills to go along with her six digs and match-
high four blocks, while Rollman had 16 kills along with
four digs and three blocking assists.

Libero Megan McGrane anchored the Panthers’
defense with 27 digs, leading all players in the match.

Setters Lindsey Macke and Azadeh Boroumand split time, ,

with Macke recording 44 assists and Boroumand adding
14 olf the bench. ‘ ‘ 6

Allison Lawrence led the way for the Beavers with 19
kills and 15 assists.

Pitt faced UAB in the consolation game, with the
Blazers fresh oﬁ’ a sweep at the hands of host Paciﬁc. The
Panthers did UAB (14-20) no favors, handing it their sec-

ond sweep of the weekend in dominating form.

Pitt easily controlled every game of the match, win-
ning by scores of 30-17, 30-22 and 30-21. The Panthers
held the Blazers to a .000 hitting percentage in each of the
ﬁrst two games and a .049 percentage for the match, while
hitting .336 themselves. ‘

Hatlestad and Rollman had match-highs of 15 kills
apiece and recorded seven and nine digs, respectively.
Miller rounded out the trio of Pittplayers with double-digit
kills, with 13 to go along with a match-high six blocks. It
was the sixth straight game that Hatlestad, Rollman and
Miller — dubbed the “Big Three” by Beerman — each
recorded double-digit kills. ‘

Macke had the only double-double in the match, with
a match-high 44 assists to go with 11 digs. McGrane added
as match-high 16 digs for Pitt, while middle hitter April

‘ Puzauskas had seven digs and four kills and was one of

four Panthers who hit .300 or better.
Breanne Swenson led the Blazers with seven kills, 13

_ digs and three blocking assists.

In the championship match of the tournament, Paciﬁc
defeated Oregon State 3-0, thus earning it an at-large bid in
the NCAA Tournament and, at the same time, eliminating
Oregon State from contention.

These matches were the ﬁnal ones of the regular sea-

. son for the Panthers, who play the University of

Pemisylvania this Friday in the ﬁrst round of the NCAA

Pitt a 26-24 advantage, and the
Panthers would never look back.

Pitt managed to start the half
with a 17-5 run and took the crowd
and the Duquesne momentum out of
the game.

A monstrous dunk by Chris Taft
put the Panthers ahead by 15 at the
8:38 mark, and the Dukes had noth-

They cut the lead to nine late in
the game, but the Panthers made
much-needed foul shots to hold on
for the victory.

Carl Krauser led all scorers with
17 points, and Page finished with

The Panthers shot 44 percent as
a team from the field. Ryan Tricco

was the only Duke in double fig-_

Duquesne played a very good game,
and we knew we weren’t going to

Say it ain’t sot Bengals have shot at AFC North title

Nocks, page 14

The foolish decision was thinking that
Maddox was ready to lead the Steelers to the
Promised Land. He came out of UCLA early
and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in
1992. Maddox was supposed to succeed
John Elway, but that did not pan out

He bounced around the league for sev-
eral years and also was out of football from
1996 through the 2000 season; somewhere
during this time period, he was selling insur-
ance. All of the sudden, Maddox ﬁgured out
how to play quarterback successfully in
2002. Come on, Cowher —— did you really
think that, after 10 years, the light ﬁnally
clicked on for Maddox?

Not likely. Maddox has had games
where he has looked decent, but for the most
part, he has thrown a lot of interceptions and
a considerable number of errant passes.
Maddox has thrown 14 touchdowns, com-
pared to 13 interceptions, this season while
completing a little better than 58 percent of
his passes.

He has two talented receivers (makes
me sick to my stomach to admit it), but is still
having trouble. I guess his cereal,‘ Tommy
Gun Flakes, will be coming oﬁ the shelves
soon. Wait a minute — nobody who I have
talked to seems to remember Stewart ever
having a cereal, and he had severaldecent
years for the Steelers, but I won’t go into
what that’s about.

Hopefully for the sake of Steelers fans,
Cowher will be more intelligent next season
in choosing the identity of his team. He does
not have the personnel to run the oﬂ°ense that
he started with this season, and by the time
that he realized that, it was too late.

I hate to say I told you so,'but I told you
so. Maddox is a one-hit wonder, and I pre-
dicted ﬂrat Stewart’s departure would spell
the demise of the Steelers. Now the
Cincinnati Bungles — I mean Bengals —
have a legitimate shot at winning the AFC
North title — I’m having trouble keeping
my lunch down again.

Kunich, who came into the game
