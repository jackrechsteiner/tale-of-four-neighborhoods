’ A 15-year-old freshman from Peabody High School in East
Liberty got the chance to rap on stage in front of an audience of
rappers, radio hosts and college students Monday night.

Monday’s Source Concert, held A in ‘the Benedum
Auditorium, was part of a series of activities that the Black
Action Society is sponsoring for Black Homecoming Week.

The Peabody student, Ujamaa Walker, was one of the few
people chosen to participate in a free-style rap contest during
the concert. The contest included people from all around, the
city of Pittsburgh, and allowed people like Walker to perform
on stage and show off their talents. ‘

“I’ve been rapping since I was nine years old,” Walker said‘.

The concert included rappers Sonny Carson, Alchemist and
Black Moon, among others. A performance by prominent rap-
per Memphis Bleek was also plarmed for .the evening.

“BAS is continually trying to raise the caliber of the'pr_o-
grams that we bring to campus,” said Lauren EvetteVV1llia_Ams,
a co-programming chair for BAS. , -

New rappers compete, show off talent

The event is also part of 'a series of appearances in the
Unsigned. Hype Tour, organized by The Source Magazine. A
‘ The tour seeks to identify people ’ with talent across the A

country. . A A .

‘ About 10 minutes before the doors to the concert were
opened, BAS received word that Memphis Bleek would not be
performing at the event, because he did not get on the plane that
would take him to Pittsburgh. A

“It’s just ridiculous,” Fahcina Lawson, a junior at Pitt, said

» of the no-show by Bleek. “He has all these loyal fans and he

doesn’t even have the decency to show up.”

That didn’t stop most people from coming out for the show, 0 '

however, as the Benedum auditorium was packed in anticipa-
tion of the night’s events. ' -

Even before the concertofﬁcially began, Big Noyd and
Alchemist were on stage presenting works from the CDs. that

which the audience judged the performances, determining the
winner.‘ I ' ' V ' ~ "

What you don’t know about bioterrorism can killyou

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

Maj. Gen. Lester Martinez-
Lopez, commander of the U.S.
Army Medical Research and
Materiel ‘Command, stressed the
need to prepare for new and unclas-
sifieddiseases and agents during a
lecture Tuesday in Scaife Hall.

“We must always be conscien-
tious of the unknown,” Martinez-
Lopez said, commenting on the cur-
rent state of biomedical research.

Martinez-Lopez also "touched
upon classifications of biological
weapons, the process by which vac-
cines and treatments are developed,
and forthcoming advancements in
his field. _ f

Martinez-Lopez has studied
medicine within the military since
1978. Since March 2002, he has
headed the Medical Research and
Materiel Command in Detrick,
Maryland.

Bioterrorism has been a top
focus of his office’s work.

Martinez-Lopez listed the clas-
sifications of current biological
weapons as nerve, blood, skin and
respiratory agents. I

“We are dealing with a big pro-
file of agents that can be of harm to

Talk of perceivedU.S. and U.N.
rift hurts everyone, Annan said

Annan, page 1

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and
Provostdarnes Maher. .. .

In addition to Annan’s speech, the
program recognized Humaira Raﬁq of
Pakistan and Jargalrnaa Tsendjav of
Mongolia, who will study at Pitt for the
next year» as ‘Heinz Fellowship recipi-
ents. . A

Annan, a Nobel Prize winner, wast-*

ed no time in confronting the publicly

a perceived rift between the United States
iandtheU.N. A. . "

“My friends, such talk ill, serves the
public,” he said -early in his speech,
“because it isbased on a fundamental
misunderstanding about what the

.. United Nations is, and what it does.”

He went on to acknowledge the
important role the United States, as the
world’s “sole remaining superpower,”
must play in world politics.

“The idea that a peaceful and pros-
perous world could be organized with-
out the active engagement of the United
States is -not credible,” he said. ' ,

"For all of his praise, though, Annan
was candid in his evaluation of the
United States’ recent unilateral actions
in Iraq, performed without the consent

— of the U.N.

. “Many people ﬁnd it troubling and

. confusing when the United States

appears to abandon the very intema-

tional instruments that bear its mar ,”
he said, tactfully choosing his words.

Furthermore, he urged the United’

States to uphold the responsibility it
carries in; being the world’s strongest
country through diplomacy, rather than
military force. _

He also made the case for increased
United States involvement in solving
world problems such as hunger, malnu-
trition and disease, by discussing the
link between civil strife and intema-
tional peace. '

“Ithink we all see, with chilling
clarity, that a world where millions of
people endure brutal humiliation and
extreme misery will never be fully
secure,” he said. .

 spoke brieﬂy about the new
UN.’ resolution to strengthen its role in

Iraq and vowed to implement the man- ,

date to the best of his ability.

He closed his speech by proclaim-
ing his faith in the world’s potential to
find “collective answers” to the many
problems facing every country, and by
inviting all Americans to join the “great
global discussion.”

“To some audiences, that may
sound like a utopian vision,” he said,
“But to live in America is to be an opti-

~ mist, to know that all things are possi-

ble.” . .
“And I_ feel conﬁdent that all of you
will do your part to make it come true.”

piece appeared on Sa1on.com and is
packed with vivid images of the world
from the perspective of a'l4 year-old girl.

“His cancer stick is a sword of ﬁre,”
she writes. “As long as that one addiction
is indulged, he can fend off all other

. transgressions.” I .

This is the kind of writing Stroud
said he wanted between the covers of

‘_ Deek — personal nonﬁction, straight
from the heart. “

Nathaniel Soltesz adds a’ different
voice to the magazine with his review of

’ the 1977 novel, “Flowers in the Attic,”

by V.C. Andrews. He gives this’ sordid
tale of incest and murder the kind of

. attention reminiscent of the New York

Times Book Review.

“It’s a great book that doesn’t get the
credit it deserves,” he said. V

Soltesz, a fan of the under-appreciat-
ed. and‘ bizarre, plans to devote his
monthly review section to a different
obscure book or movie.

His motivation for exposing the
masses to these forgotten gems?

“I don’t know,” he said. “It makes

me look cool.” i
The magazine also features Ben
Rubin, the driving force behind the
Creation Station’s “Headhunter” sketch
comedy show. Rubin returns to the col-
umn writing business with “Idiotic
Virtuosity,” a monthly piece that serves

to charmel his. own personal brand of .

humor. A

“The most unique writing I have is
from my own ‘personal life,” he said.

This month’s issue ﬁnds Rubin wax-
ing philosophical on his struggle to
accept his addiction to self—love. Situated
between porn references and graphic
images of masturbation are serious
moments of self—reﬂection; '

“I’d feel like I just raped myself,” he
writes, with complete sincerity. ~'

One Wednesday each month, at 9:30
p.m., Deek will hold a reading at
Hemingway’s Cafe. Several writers will
showcase their work in an open-rnic—
style format. Copies of Deek Magazine
are available at various points around
campus.

Cheap textbooks accessible, ﬂeeting

Cheaper textbooks, it seems, are
just an ocean away.

On Oct. 21, The New York Times
reported that textbooks are on average
50 percent cheaper in Europe, and that
American students, having noticed the
disparity in prices, have begun order-
ing their books from overseas. The
article compared prices at
Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk, and
found the latter much more economi-
cal.

These prices indicate a greater"

problem — college students are a ﬁxed

_ audience with a ﬁxed demand and our

every necessity comes with a jacked-
up price.

In order to live near campus, we
need apartments, no matter how ver-
min-filled or poorly maintained.
Similarly, in order to pass classes, we
need to buy books, and buy them
quickly.

Usually, this is done at bookstores
on or around campus. But these stores
are losing business to their cheaper
overseas competitors, so the National
Association of College Stores wrote to
textbook publishers to end what it
views as gouging students by inﬂating
prices.

Besides petitioning publishers to
lower prices, students can already
trawl the Internet for better prices, par-
ticularly on used books. Also, there are
Pitt—oriented sites that offer cheap

rates on used books e allowing stu-
dents to post what books they have as
classified ads, then exchari/ge them.
But these take more time than many
students have; moreover, with new
editions published every year, these
efforts can prove fruitless. ' »

What about buying brand spankin’
new books, hot from European Web-
sites? Ordering from overseas isn’t
illegal — in fact a 1998 Supreme
Court ruling holds that copyright laws
don’t protect manufactures from peo-
ple ordering books at cheaper prices
that those manufacturers set.

So what’s a broke college student
to do? Ordering books from overseas
is one way to go -- for now. But as this
practice becomes increasingly popular,‘
manufacturers might erect new obsta-
cles between students and the texts
they so desire. “It is an open question
how long the overseas price differen-
tial lasts,” The Times reports.

Rather than sitting back and allow-
ing textbook manufacturers to mug us
for extra money, why not order online?
A textbook company representative
said that‘ these lower prices are
designed for’ people with lower_ per
capita incomes. So, as students with
relatively low per capita incomes, and
rising tuition fees and costs, we should
use these ﬂeeting advantages — but do
so knowing that they could be quickly
taken away. '

Harold Bloom thinks Americans are
getting dumber. V i /

Bloom, an eloquent and occasionally
grandiloquent literary critic, addressed what
he considered the recent “dumbing down”
of American readers, in a Sept. 24 column
printed in the Los Angels Times.

He decried J .K Rowling, Stephen King
and Danielle Steele —-— writers of children’s
literature, horror ﬁction and romance novels,
respectively — as purveyors of this igno-
rance of the classics and aban-
donment of the canon — or,
rather, his canon, as he wrote
“The Western Canon,” an’
homage to Western » civiliza-
tion’s greatest works. ,

Universities, because they
stand at the tricky crossroads
between democratic interests
and academic ones, are always
among the ﬁrst casualties
whenever crotchety cultural
critics decide that civilization is

 

Sydney Bergman

But for the rest of us, as the unwashed,
vaguely literate masses, is it better to havea
passing acquaintance with Shakespeare than
an in-depth knowledge of King?

Bloom and Almond are railing against
the wrong thing. Rather than saying that we
are reading the wrong books, they should be

saying that we are reading them the wrong’

way. You can’t cure intellectual sloth with
Middlemarch or with any of the so—called

' great books. The real problem, it seems, is

not that people are reading
shallow things, but that they

‘ arereading them shallowly.
Instead of criticizing stu-
dents for their ignorance,

not taught the proper method-

reader, a bibliophile — my
‘ bookshelves sag and threaten
to collapse each time I riﬂe
through them. I’ve, been
known to clutch Chekhov in

in decline. Inherent is the ques-
tion:_ Can the populist notion of

universal education mesh with the creation '

of a learned elite?

College should be a necessary celebra- A

tion of this canon —— in the words of my
advisor, “It’s time to get canonized.”

And college students are often dis-
cussed as examples of the best and worst
readers. Short-story writer Steve Almond

- i wrote a biting response to Bloom’s piece, a ‘

well-done critique of what’s wrong With lit-
erary elitism. Still, Almond voiced his horror
at dealing with students who think that
“Hamlet” is “a really cool movie starring
Ethan Hawke.” But this is the problem —
even someone who thinks that literature
should be accessible mocks those who can-
not, for one reason or another, get into it.
Should that student be a literature major,
then ﬁe on him — it’s_ his responsibility to be
‘well versed in historical literature, and have
at least a cursory knowledge of canonical, as
well as non-canonical, books. . ’ /

my anns and chant, “my pre-
, " cious, my precious.”
As such, I’m qualiﬁed to say that to read

well should be to read ecstatically. It means

poring over every line, as if each word could

bring destruction or salvation. When I look.

into books, I see — or at least strive to see —'
a reﬂection of the human experience, and
myself, vividly portrayed. It is a visceral
experience, as well as an intellectual one,
one that sends my emotions churning and
minds atwitter. » "
Similarly, kids should be taught to bring

the love — and in doing so, pursue what .

they love, be it science ﬁction or
Shakespeare. Rather’ than drawing an
intractable line between literature and pulp,

drawit between those willing to bring the '

love, and those only stringing along for a
grade. Now that’s something for Harold
Bloom to get ﬂustered over.

Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour
Developed by Camelot
Published by Nintendo
Nintendo GameCube

7,“nik1/2
Baseball, go-cart racing, tennis,
now golf again — there doesn’t

seem to be a single sport on which
Nintendo isn’t willing to stick
Mario’s face. However, given the
care that the Big N typically puts
into its offerings, this has rarely
proven to be a bad thing.

“Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour”
builds off of the framework laid
down in the N64 iteration of “Mario
Golf” and provides a bevy‘ of
options, play modes and challenges
—— such as playing only
with clubs selected at
random or making shots
through floating rings
—— for everyone from
your 6-year-old nephew 
to your beer-swilling
roommate. '

At its most
basic level,§,,x§,t;_

until it falls into the hole. The game
does a decent job of club selection
for you, and each shot is aimed by
default at the hole. Hence, a new
player can be taught the game sim-
ply by pointing at the screen and
stating, “Press the button. When
this bar gets to here, press-it again.”
The controls are_just that
simple.
However, for the
adept player, there are
loads of options to fur-_
ther enhance the golfing
experience: Wind must be taken
into consideration, hooks and slices
can be controlled by changing the

by button combos during the swing.

The graphics are lush, gorgeous
and outstanding — I could go on for

a pageaboupt just how beautiful this ‘

game is. The screen layout amaz-
ingly includes information on your
club choice, wind speed and direc-
tion, lie, english, pin location and
trajectory, all while staying out of
the way of the beautiful fairway

_ you’re about to cut a swath through.

The music —— mostly remixes of
,old Mario tunes — showcases
more steel drums than one would

For reasons unknown to us all, most

indistinguishable from those of Ms.

“Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour” is
a solid buy in my book, but I hap-

From
autumn to

Club Laga

Former Ferret Records heroes,
the members of From Autumn to
Ashes, made quite a splash on the
music scene this year after jumping
onto better-known Vagrant Records

" in order to release their critically

acclaimed smash, The Fiction We
Live. The boys will be hitting Club
Laga on Thursday night with ex-

-Ferret partners Every Time I Die,

The Prize Fighter, and Pittsburg
local act, Shill. —
From Autumn to Ashes has been
touring the pastfew years, gaining
notoriety with their metallic hardcore

1 style, which brandishes a wicked

Ky

soothing vocal as a backing track.
The music thrashes and then goes
into melodic breakdowns a la Poison
the Well. Vocalist‘Ben]amin Perri
does all the screaming and talking
parts while drummer Francis Mark
delivers on-key singing, which is a
surprise to- many. V L
“Our goal, as far as sound goes,
is to not conform to one style and
create our own sound,” Mark said on
their Web, __ , site,
fromautumntoashescom.

’ Every Time I Die ‘also released a

new record this year on Ferret called

) Hot Damn! The record boasts a new '

side to the band, bringing forth even
more melodic sounds than they were

capable of before. Perhaps it’s the ‘
evolving scene, or even the willing- -.

ness to allow for some accessibility,
but either way, it’s damn good.
I ,-“RCA Recording artists Cave In

will no longer be performing on this

tour. They have decided to tour

, Europe with the ethereal UK artists

Muse. Whi1e,it’s disappointing to
note'l.t'h‘at' Cave In isn’t playing in
Pittsburgh this year, it is good news
to know that they’re playing with an
amazing band across the sea.
Despite the lack of space rock,
this show should still shape up to
draw a pretty big crowd and could
sell out prior to ‘starting. It would be

A very unwise..?.tof‘.miss this show, espe-

cially for fans of the newer form of

metal. * V

From Autumn‘ to Ashes, Every Time I

play Club Laga in Oakland on
Thurs., Oct. 23, at 7p.m. Tickets are

Music at Carlow is as easy as 1-3-5

One night, three bands, five bucks and a
fine evening. .

That is what Carlow College, a small
women’s school just up Fifth Ave., is offering
the general public at its first CARLOW 1-3-5
night. The event will feature three local acts
in an evening aimed at celebrating the diver-
sity of the Pittsburgh music scene.

Brad Yoder, resident folkie of the city, is
almost as-popular in Pittsburgh’s coffee shops
as soy lattes. Recently voted “Best Local
Acoustic Artist” by the readers of the City
Paper, he’1l bring his mellow voice and tex-
tured songwriting skills to the evening. Ritual
Space Travel Agency, a local five-piece with
influences ranging from Sly and the Family

Stone to Frank Zappa, will exercise their self-
proclaimed dedication to “make people dance
to strange music.”‘And Masai Turner, emcee
from Strict Flow and local hip-hop visionary,
will round out the evening with his rap skills
honed on the streets of Pittsburgh.

So if I you’re short on dough, entertain-
ment and wheels, take a walk down the street
for some cheap, convenient fun.

It’ll be as easy as 1-2-3.

CARLOW 1-3-5 will take place on Thurs.,
Oct. 23 at 7:30 p.m; in the Antonian Theater
at Carlow College in Oakland. Tickets are $5.

What did you tell them? That Radio killed the movie star

Radio .

Directed by Michael tollin

Cuba Gooding, Jr. has obviously
forgotten that at one time he graced
the stage at the Academy Awards.

tranquilizers. Chances are, the two
are pretty equal. '

The reason for the tedium of
“Radio” is obvious. The film is
wrong on so many levels that no
amount of suspension of disbelief can
legitimize it. For one, it’s such a feel-

good movie that conﬂict among the

characters is practically non-existent.
The animosity toward Radio, or his
mentor Jones, is quickly resolved and

Since his Best Supporting Actor win
for “Jerry Maguire,”‘he has starred in
a continuous string ofiundeniably for-
gettable films. “Radio” is no excep-
tion.

Based on a true story, the film
stars Gooding as James Robert
“Radio” Kennedy, a mentally dis-
abled man living in a small South
Carolina town during the 1970s. He
is befriended by the local high school
football coach Howard Jones (Ed
Harris), who, despite the disapproval
of the school board, takes Radio in as
the team’s personal mascot.

As the movie progresses, the
audience is made to believe that
Radio endures many hardships and,
with Jones’s help, wins the hearts of
the narrow-minded townspeople. If
this plotline sounds tired and boring,
try watching it without wondering
how the experience compares to get-
ting shot with high doses of elephant

avoids escalating into anything seri-
ous. Because of this, the film drags
into two hours of unnecessary,
manipulative sap, ending with the
realization that the community never
had any real problems with Radio in

T the first place.

Since there are no moments of
tension among the characters, many
of them are underdeveloped and
uninteresting. Harris’s performance,

COURTESY COLUMBIA PICTURES

  

for example, is narrowed down to
strutting around in tight fitting bell-
bottoms and spouting idiotic lines of
nonsense like, “We’re not teaching
Radio, Radio is teaching us.”
Gooding, on the other hand, starts

out with potential but ends up look-

ing goofy rather than severely handi-
capped. The chemistry between the
characters. also suffers due to the

' film’s inadequacies. Because the film

never- fully investigates the back-
ground of either Radio or Jones, the
motivation behind the unlikely
friendship is never revealed.

In the end, one questions how a
film with such a- high suck factor got
into theaters when it actually should,
have been premiering on the
Hallmark channel. The explanation
might" include director Michael
To1lin’s past involvement with the-
small screen.‘ Tollin» directed such
television, shows as the short-lived
puppet fiasco “Cousin Skeeter,”
before ‘trying his hand at feature
films.’He also continues to produce‘
shows like the »WB’s “One Tree Hil1.”~

With a background full of crap like 2

that, how could he not soil thescreen.
with such an unsatisfying movie?

A Another Pitt team lost at home to
Notre Dame.
‘ ‘ But this time,‘ it was the women’s soc-
cer ' tearn’s 1-0 loss to the No. 2—ranked
Fighting Irish on Sunday. This could end
up being a turning point in the Panthers’
season, according to head coach‘Sue—Moy

“[This was a]_ moral victory,” Chin
said. “We showed that we could" play with

the ﬁrst half. But Pitt managed to keep the

ing Notre Dame few scoring opportunities.

That changed in the 22nd minute,
when Irish back Christie Shaner lobbed a

head the ball past goalkeeper Jamie Pelusi.

seven saves on the day. Q . _

Men’s soccer shut out for
fourth time this season

The Pitt men’s soccer team suffered its fourth
loss of the season. The Panthers did not score a
goal, losing 1-0 to the Providence Friars on
Saturday.

The Panthers’ (5-9-0 overall, 2-5-0 Big East)
loss to Providence (6-5-2, 4-2-1) dropped them to

. 3-2 in their last four games after beginning the sea-

son 2-7.

Pitt rriidﬁelder Mike Cunha led the Panthers
oﬁensively with three attempted shots. Forward
Keeyan Young, midﬁelder Marco Carrizales and
midﬁelder Bryan Headrick each attempted two
shots. Pitt and Providence we're even with ten shots

reach, but the Panthers couldn’t capitalize.

“There was a lot of disruption  the attack,”

head coach Joe Luxbacher said. ‘"Ihere were a lot
of fouls _and instead of focusing on the game, the
guys tried to get back at the other team. But I think
we had more chances then [Providence] did.”

Keeper Justin Lowery and Pitt’s defense played
strong throughout the game, but Providence was
able to overcome the Panthers’ efforts to score in
the 81st minute of play.

Eoin Lynch scored the lone goal off an‘ indirect
kick. The ball was ﬁred into a defensive wall and
Carlos Suero claimed the rebound. Suero lofted the
ball over both the wall and Lowery for the goal.

“It was a tough loss. The game really could
have gone either way,” Luxbacher said.

The next chance to see the Panthers in action at ’
home is on Oct. 25, at 7 p.m.,—when they take on
Ohio State.

if

How does the softest team in the
National Basketball Association
become softer? By acquiring a beast
of a power forward who spends all
day shooting three pointers, that’s

‘how.

On Monday, the Dallas
Mavericks, in a five—player trade,
received Antoine Walker,’ formerly

of the Boston Celtics. Now, Walker

would be an outstanding forward
and would probably score 25 points
‘and _have 10 or more rebounds a
game, if he ever stayedin the -paint.
Instead, Walker hovers around the
three-point line waving his hand to
show everyone he is open for a
three. . ' ‘

If Walker shot even 30 percent

from the arc, this would not be such

a bad thing, but the only person he
outshoots, percentage-wise, is the
trigger-happy Allen Iverson. ‘So why
did the Mavericks go and get this
guy? .

My guess is they have decided
defense is meaningless. With the
players they have coming back, and

some new acquisitions, ‘Dallas has
the ability to score about 150 points
’ at night. Since their post game is so

weak, and they are not a very phys-
ical team,‘the Mavericks’ only way

i_ of making it out of the Western,»

Conference this season will be by

scoring ridiculous amounts» of

points. ‘
Speaking of the

battle in my apartment is about to
begin. My roommates and I have
decided to order NBA League Pass,

0 which entitles us to View almost
’ every-NBA game every night.‘

It’s a pretty sweet _deal, since it "
 will only c.ost $100 for the. entire

season — a steal, as far as my apart-
ment is concerned. .
The trick will be that my apart-

" iment’s. favorite show also begins on
I Tuesday, which is Fox’s “24.” What
. , shall "we do? Picture-in-picture is

not an option, and taking a break
when our favorite teams are oniwill

start holding out again? It seems
like it, but Brian Westbrook, the
Villanova prodigy, is the only viable
weapon the Eagles have. Maybe he
should take the snaps from under
center.

Is it me, or don’t the 2003
Steelers’ look eerily similar to the
1995 Steelers? Both ‘got off to bad
starts-, 2-3 in ’95 and 2-4 in ’03.
Both have immobile, yet at times

Fitzgerald named Big East Co—Player of the Week

MATT SORTINO
b Staff Writer

Standout wide receiver Lany Fitzgerald, had eight
catches for 207 yards and two touchdowns against Rutgers
on Saturday, and that was only in the ﬁrst half.

Despite not registering another catch the rest of the day;
the Big East Conference has named Fitzgerald its Oifensive
Co-Player of the Week for his performance.

Six games into the season, Fitzgerald already has 13
touchdown catches, which matches the Big East single-sea-
son record set by Pitt’s Terry Murphy in 1997. g -

VV1th his two touchdown catches against Rutgers,
Fitzgerald extended his, streak of consecutive games with a
touchdown to 12, one shy of the national record set by
Charles Rogers at Michigan State. Rogers currently plays for

the Detroit Lions in the National Football League.‘

Last weekend marked the halfway point for the college
football season, and the midseason accolades for Fitzgerald
were plentiful. He has been named the nation’s “Best
Offensive Player” by usatoday.com in its midseason awards
listing and was also named a “Midseason A]l—Amen'can” by
sportsillustratedcom along with collegefootballnews.corn.

For the season, Fitzgerald, a Heisman trophy candidate,
has 45 receptions for 869 yards and 13 touchdowns, which
is tops in the nation.

O’Donnell in 1995 and Tommy
Maddox this year. Both had a slash,
Kordell Stewart for O’Donnell and
Antwaan Randle El for Maddox.
Both had a big, bruising back: Barn
Morris and Jerome ‘Bettis, respec-
tively.
The similarities continue, but
the Steelers have a chance, this
V week, to embark on something the
’95 Steelers did. Following the 2-3
start, the ’95 Steelers went 10-1
‘down the stretch to finish 12-4. I
believe the current (Steelers need to
do one thing in order to make a sim-

grow a beard. 4
Every year, O’Donnell would
start slow and, as the weather-got
colder, would grow one. "It was
effective in his final two seasons
leading the Steelers to two consecu-

Now that Bettis is the starting
running back again, and the weath-
er is turning cold, could ‘Maddox

zly looking. Tommy Maddox on
Sunday at Heinz Field when the St.
Louis Rams come into town, and
the run to Houston, where Super
