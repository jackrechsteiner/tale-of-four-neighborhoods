Controversy threatens funding
of Pitt Environmental Law Clinic

ecause Pitt’s Environ-
mental Law Clinic has
angered state legisla-

tors by representing opponents
of timbering in the Allegheny
National Forest, the clinic could
be out of money in about a year.

Last summer, lawmakers ex-
pressed their anger by adding a
line to Pitt’s state appropriation
bill, prohibiting the University
from spending tax money on
Environmental Law Clinic per-
sonnel or operations during the
ﬁscal year that ends June 30,
2002.

,Chancello‘r Mark Norden-
berg and Provost James Maher
now are calling on clinic person-
nel to work with them on a “cre-

    »

punitive actionbi the staéésﬁé; S

ciﬁcally, they are proposing to
transform the Environmental
Law Clinic into an independent,
non-proﬁt corporation afﬁliated
with Pitt and its law school.

But clinic director Thomas
Buchele is dubious. “The Uni-
versity recruited me to _Pitts—
burgh last year to be a law pro-
fessor, not to run a public inter-
est law ﬁrm, which is what the
clinic would become under the
arrangement they [the chancel-
lor and provost] are proposing,”
Buchele said. -

“I think it’s really important
that people look at deeds as well
as words,-and I don’t think the
University administration’s
deeds jibe with their words,”
Buchele added. “They say they
have defended the clinic, yet they
are now using this language by
the state legislature as a sword
against me and the clinic.”

In response to the prohibi-
tion against spending state tax
money on the Environmental

Law Clinic, Pitt is charging the 1

clinic for its administrative, over-
head and space costs. Those
costs, for which Pitt is billing the
clinic monthly, are expected to‘

exceed $63,000 this year. The I burgh Campus andthe comma-

clinic’s current, annual operat-
ing budget is $130,000-plus, all
of it from Heinz Endowment
grants and other private funding
sources.

At the rate it’s being charged,
the clinic will go bankrupt “in a
little over a year,” Buchele pre-
dicted.

He suggested that Pitt’s ac-
tions are linked to the clinic’s
current representation of Citi-
zens Against New Toll Roads, a
group opposed to the Mon-

 

Fayette Expressway. The pro-
posed highway project would
pass through Hazelwood and
other city neighborhoods.

The executive director of the
Mon Valley Progress Council
(which supports the expressway
project) has sent letters to Chan-
cellor Nordenberg and elected
ofﬁcials, criticizing the clinic for
its role in the controversy.

‘ At an Oct. 17 public hearing
in Hazelwood to discuss the ex-
pressway, Mayor Tom Murphy
accused the Pennsylvania Turn-
pike Commission of pressuring
Pitt to silence its Environmental
Law Clinic. In an Oct. ‘1 8 letter
to Nordenberg, Murphy blasted
Pitt for allegedly caving in to

g,. n .. nrp

Murphy later apologized for his
letter, saying he hadrﬁt under-
stood the context in which Pitt
imposed its administrative/ over-
head charges on the Environ-
mental Law Clinic.

“The timing [of the imposi-
tion of those charges] and their
linkto the Mon-Fayette Express-

  £6 Naraeab-erg, A A P

way is simply a coincidence,” the
chancellor said.

Nordenberg and Arthur
Ramicone, vice chancellor for
Budget and Controller, said Pitt
did not begin charging the clinic
until recently because Rami-
cone’s ofﬁce was preoccupied in
July and August — traditionally,
its busiest months -— with
higher—priority projects follow-
ing passage of Pitt’s state appro-
priation.

Buchele questioned why his
clinic is being billed for 100 per-
cent of its administrative, over-
head and space costs when the
University gets only about 20
percent of its budget from the
state (and that percentage is even
lower in the law school, which
relies to a larger extent on tu-
ition money).

“If Pitt is prohibited from
spending tax dollars on the clinic,
why isn’t that money being as-
sessed in proportion to our share
of those state dollars?” Buchele
asked.

Ramicone said the clinic
charges are not assessed in pro-
portion to the sources of Pitt’s
overall budget. Rather, he said,

 

Assembly to discuss law clinic

Faculty Assembly will discuss the Environmental Law Clinic
controversy at the Assembly’s. next meeting, Nov. 6.

“I don’t know whether a formal resolution will be presented,
but the issue will be on the meeting agenda,” said University

Cassing said he has asked the Senate’s tenure and academic
freedom committee to study the issue in detail. 9
Faculty Assembly includes professors elected to represent
their colleagues in each Pitt school. Within the Senate system,
it serves as a sort of lower house, often discussing issues before
they go on to Senate Council. The Council includes administra-
tors, staff and student representatives in addition to faculty.
Assembly and Council‘ are advisory groups. Their recom-
mendations are not binding on Pitt’s senior administration. I

Pitt, FBI offer reward in anthrax

itt will match the
_ $5,000 re’ward
money the FBI is of-

fering for the arrest and convic-
tionof the perpetrator of an an-
thrax hoax on campus.
Chancellor Mark N orden-
berg announced the reward yes-
terday, Oct. 24. “We hope that

‘this matching reward will help

bring to justice the individual or
individuals responsible for these

hoaxes,” Nordenberg said.

Two 911 phoneecalls on Oct.
13 — during Pitt’s homecoming

weekend — threatening that an— -

thrax would be released in the
William Pitt Union and Hillman

Library prompted a partial

evacuation of the lower Pitts-

cial area between Bouquet and
Belleﬁeld streets along Fifth and
Forbes avenues.

The calls were made between
9 and 10 p.m. from Oakland pay
phones. Pittsburgh police joined
campus police in searching the
two threatened University build-
ings. An “all—clear” announce-
ment was issued by police at ap-
proximately 11:30 p.m., when
ofﬁcials determined that the calls
were a hoax.

Interim University Police

Chief Tim Delaney acknowl-
edged that there was some con-
fusion on Oct. 13 between in-
structions given by the Pitts-
burgh police and the campus

police in response to thelhoax. V

“That has been worked out,”
Delaneysaid. “We’ve agreed on
the protocol to be followed in
the event of another threat. Ba-
sically, in the event of a
bioterroristic substance, only the
buildings where the substances
are, or are threatened to be,
should be evacuated. It’s better
to have people -who are inside
other buildings stay there.”

The apparent perpetrator of
the Oct. 13 Oakland hoax later
that night twice threatened a
North Side apartment complex
with similar 91 1 calls, Pittsburgh
police reported. 1

Last week,.the FBI released
tapes of the four 911 calls and
offered a reward of $5,000 for
the arrest and conviction of the
caller. Anyone with information
on the hoaxes should call the FBI
at 412/471-2000.

Chief Delaney said there have
been no additional phone threats
to the campus. “There have been
19 reports of suspicious letters
or packages or objects,” he said,

“and we, by policy, have sent an
ofﬁcer and supervisor to investi-
gate all of them. We’ve pack-
aged the items in sealed; plastic
and delivered them to the AI-
legheny Fire Academy, which is
the FBI compound for investi-

gating packages. We’ve had no -

conﬁrmations of any dangerous
substances. I think people are
being cautious and following the
instructions that came out on
what to do with suspicious mail
or with items that can’t be iden-
tiﬁed, which is to contact us.”
According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,
anthrax is a non—contagious acute

_infectious disease caused by a

spore-forming bacterium. An-
thrax infection occurs in three
forms: cutaneous, which is ac-
quired through an_ abrasion of
the skin; inhalation, which is ac-
quired through air passages from

» environmental sources, and gas-

trointestinal, usually contracted
by the consumption of meat from
infected animals.

Nationally, concerns about
anthrax have grown in the last
few weeks as documented cases
of the potentially deadly disease
have been mounting in Florida,
Colorado, New York and Wash-

they are based on the standard,
cost—accounting formula for edu-
cational institutions spelled out
by the federal Ofﬁce of Manage-
ment and Budget’s Circular A-
2 1.

“It’s the same methodology
we use in costing out overhead
for all activities at the institu-
tion, including sponsored re-
search,” Ramicone said.

Buchele charged that Pitt’s
administration has barred his
clinic from seeking additional
foundation funds until the clinic
agrees not to take on cases likely
to anger Harrisburg lawmakers.
Pitt law school Dean David Her-
ring seemed to reinforce that
impression in a recent e-mail to
William Luneburg, who directs
Pitt’s academic program in envi-
ronmental law.

Luneburg had asked whether
the Environmental Law Clinic
might seek endowment funds
from the Hillman and R.K.

 

Herringfiwrote: “I think thatiilif
we could assure the provost that
the clinic will not take on any
clients that will cause contro-
versy in Harrisburg and draft
some guidelines that would en-
sure this, then we could get sup-
port for an approach:to these

ington, D.C. Ofﬁcials believe
that anthrax is being spread
through the U.S. mail.

Health, safety and security
personnel at Pitt continue to be
in a state of high alert following
the Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks and
subsequent anthrax—related
events, according to Robert Hill,
executive director of Public Af-
fairs. ,

“The practices and proce-
dures for biosafety and related
matters on our campus, includ-
ing for personnel in the Ofﬁce of
Environmental Health and
Safety, are being examined and
there will be some changes,” Hill
said. “That new information will
not bereleased. publicly or put
up on the web out of security
concerns, because we don’t want
to let terrorists or other would-
be troublemakers know how we
will deal’ with various situations.”

Calls to Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Envi-
ronmental Health and Safety and

Joel E. Peterson

Joel E. Peterson, a Pitt me-
chanical engineering professor
for more than 40 years, died of

_ complications from chronic my-

elogenous leukemia on Oct. 15,
2001. He was 67.

A memorial service and re-
ception will be held at 2 p.m.
Nov. 3 at First Unitarian Church
of Pittsburgh, at Ellsworth and

Morewood avenues in Shadyside:

Campbell Yates, retired
chairperson of mechanical engi-
neering, called Peterson “one of
the best teachers we’ve ever had
in the department.”

Peterson’s teaching special-
ties included aerodynamics, pro-
pulsion and automatic control of
airplanes. Students and col-
leagues praised his clear expla-
nations of complex material, his
open-door policy and candor as
an adviser, and the way he con-
tinually ﬁne—tuned his lectures.

But no one called Peterson
an easy grader. In the ﬁeld of
aeronautics, not even Orville and
Wilbur Wright earned an A+
from Peterson. “They didn’t

design their airfoils right. Made
them too thin,” Peterson told
the University Times in 1991,
the year he was awarded the
Chancellor’s Distinguished
TeachingAward. Four years ear-
lier, he received the engineering
school’s Beitle—Veltri Teaching
Award.

Yates, as department chair-

1-person,’ sat in on some of

Peterson’s lectures and remem-
bered Peterson as being excep-
tionally well—organized. “In en-
gineering, you do a lot of writing
on the board —— equations and so
forth,” Yates said. “He would
stop and make sure that students
understood every step of the way.
Some of us, I’m afraid, would
sometimes get up there and rattle
off equations across the board,
and students would be running
six words behind and wouldn’t
know what was going on.”

Peterson likened his class-
room presentations to engineer-
ing projects; he broke subjects
down into small, understandable
components. “I sit down and
organize a thought process
through,” he said in a University
Times interview. “I make the
basics very clear so there’s a good,
solid foundation to what’s hap-
pening.”

During the decade prior to
his retirement in June 1998,
Peterson directed Pitt engineer-
ing students in an annual contest
to build a racing car. Every year,
the Pitt team would compete

against teams from Detroit uni-

versities.

For 30 years, he advised Pitt’s
chapter of Triangle Fraternity,
and was instrumental in its pur-
chase of a house. In gratitude,
the fraternity gave Peterson its
service award.

Peterson’s family was always
the center of his life, said his wife
of 40 years, Jean. Despite his
teaching and research in such
areas as theoretical subsonic
aerodynamics and experimental

automotive aerodynamics,

Peterson found time to help his ’
children build a two-story tree .

house (complete with windows,
shutters and electricity) as well

as an underground house dug
into a hillside on the family’s
property in Churchill.

“When our daughter and son
were small, he spent hours play-
ing with them. Building blocks
in the living room were almost a
nightly affair,” Jean Peterson
said.

One of the few times Peterson
shut himself away from his fam-
ily was when he was preparing

his next lecture. “Even if a lec— "

ture was practically perfect, he‘
always thought he could improve
it,” his wife said.

Peterson’s other interests in-
cluded photography, auto repair
(he kept his ’46 Plymouth run-
ning for 22 years) and research-
ing family history. For 29 years,

_ he -managed the family-owned

Ideas needed
for Senate
plenary session

To the University community:
University Senate President
James H. Cassing has asked me
to chair an ad hoc committee to
arrange a plenary session of the
University Senate in March
2002. Plenary sessions are open
to faculty, staff, students and ad-
ministrative ofﬁcers. At plenary
sessions we discuss matters con-
cerning the whole University,
its policies, its plans and its ex-
pectations. The plenary session
is the town meeting for the whole
academic community. ,
Bythis notice, I am asking (1)
for faculty volunteers to serve
on this committee to plan the
session, and (2) I am asking for
suggestions of interesting, pro-
vocative, necessary topics.
Professor Lewis Jacobson
(biological sciences) suggests
that we follow up the statement
by our new chair of the Board of
Trustees. Chairman William
Dietrich said he “opposes
corporatization of college and
universities.” He feels that trust-
ees look upon the University as
“more like a business” and there-
fore do not appreciate the “rich-
ness of its intellectual and cul-

_ tural contributi

farm in Illinois that his Swedish
great—grandfather started. Dur-
ing the 1990s, Peterson wrote a
1,000—page account of his par-
ents’ lives and his own story.
Peterson was diagnosed with
chronic . myelogenous leukemia
in early 1998. He participated in
trials for a new drug, Gleevec,
for the disease. For that reason,
the family requests that memo-
rial contributions be sent to the

* 1Leuk*emia arid“I;Zy‘rnphori1‘a‘So’"c‘i€- 
*ety (specify for Gleevec re-

search), Two Gateway Center
13N, Pittsburgh 15222.

In addition to his wife,
Peterson is survived by his son,
Ken; his daughter, Jennifer
Magruder; his sister, Karin
Clark, and six grandchildren.

ns.” Howmight
we focus this question for a ple-
nary session? VVhom might we
invite to speak? .
Nathan Hershey has sug-
gested that we all should read
Morris Berman’s “The Twilight
of American Culture.” One
shouldn’t judge a book by its
title, but this title raises hackles
with me. Since when have we
Americans been able to seize a

culture and make it just ours?

After Sept. 1 1, the phrase is even
more worrisome. I have been
reading Berman; it is an update
and popular revision of Oswald
Spengler’s 1922 “Decline and
Fall of the West.” Those who
have read Nietzsche will also
recognize the argument.

medicine graduated
from Pitt 4- and never
planned to return‘ to  
Pittsburgh.  

Twenty—one years after completing her medical degree at
Pitt, feannette South-Paul has returned to chair the School

V of Medicine ’s family medicine department. . .

“To be honest, I never envisioned coming back to'lPitts-

‘ burgh, ” says South-Paul, 48, who was born in Greensboro,

Ala., and grew’ up in Philadelphia. She was among the few
African-American medical students at Pitt in the late 1970s,
and while South—Paul says her educational experience here
was “superb, ” she felt isolated socially. .
A “From a social perspective, it was not only unsupportive
here for people of color, it was malignant, ” she says." ‘I g
So, South-Paul was wary-when invited to interview for
the-job of chairperson of-Pitt’s Department of Family Medi-
cine -— a department that didn ’t exist when she was a student

I ,  out 

her training in ﬁzmily practice at the Eisenhower Army

‘ ,Medical Centerat Fort Gordon in Augusta, Ga. In 1986, she

began work at the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., where she «chaired that
‘school’sﬁzmily medicine department. . ‘ ,

“I was happy where I was, ” she says. “I wasn ’t looking to
leave Bethesda. ” I ‘ ' '  e .

But in revisiting ‘Pitt, South-Paul discovered that her
alma mater had undergone “a paradigm shift, ” as she saw it.
Once passive in working with underserved communities and
in recruiting minorities,‘ the School ofMedicine now was
aggressively pursuing both goals, she concluded, and Pitt and

UPMC Health System-were recruiting family health proﬁ:s- V ,

sionals to their medical and teaching staffs.

On june 30, South-Paul retired from the U.S. Army as I

a ﬁtll colonel. The next day, she oﬁicially became Pitt’: new
ﬁzmily medicine chair, her ﬁrst civilian job in decades.

South-Paul is married to Michael Paul, an orthopaedic-

surgeon who is in private practice in Maryland. They have

twb sons: Augustine, _ 18, a ﬁeshman at»Loyola College in -
, Baltimore, and Benjamin, 14,. a freshman hereat Central *

Catholic High School.

University Times Assistant Editor_Bruce Steele recently I

interviewed South-Paul. ,

UNIVERSITY TIMES: You’re_ the ﬁrst woman as
a well as the ﬁrst African—American»to‘s“erve as penna-

nent chairpersonpf a department at Pitt’s School of
Medicine, and one of the few black women to chair
a department at-any U.S. medical school. Is, that a

I source of pride? Do you feel you risk being pigeon- V

holed by your gender and race? _ .. .
SOUTH-PAUL: I do have mixed feelings. When I
accepted the position, I did not know that I would be the
ﬁrst African—American chair or the ﬁrst woman chair. It
‘did not come up in the discussion. If it was in__the minds
of those who were interviewing me, they didn’t let me
know about it. ' , ’ . ,
Every day, I’m aware that I am an African—American
woman. Every single day. But when I go to_ do a‘ job, I just
, think: Does my skill—set ﬁt appropriately with the needs
of the particular job that I’m -looking at?

Given your professional success, are you automati-

cally seen as a role model?

I probably am. People look to me as being an example _

of what African Americans and women can do, and I’m
prepared to accept that responsibility. Itgcan be burden-
some at times because it requires you to do more, be in

aufgot ‘

more places and be more active, perhaps, than someone

who" doesn’t have those same characteristics. Some-
times, I just have to say, “I can only be in so many places
at once.” _ -y

‘Do you think your presence here will help in re-

cruiting women and African Americans?

I hope so. I hope that my being here will make a
difference in terms of who isconsidered for positions at
the sgudent, staff. and faculty levels. We have a respon-
sibilityin higher education to provide anexperience that

that doesn’t look like white middle America. If we don’t
attend to that, we are going to lose that segment of the
population, who, by the way, now make up greater than
50 percent of new entrants into the workforce. »

As a -supervisor, i_t’s very easy to hire the person that
you’re .most comfortable. with, and that’s often the

person _who looks most like you in terms of race and P
ethnicity, gender, age, geographic origin and even reli-

gion.
 you don’t look much like Chancellor Mark

I 7 Nordenberg or Arthur Levine, dean of the medical

school. What does ‘it say about them that, nonethe-
less, they recruited" you?

I think it says that those gentlemen are visionaries,
that they share a vision of how this University can get

better and expand its- scope. Both have been quite sup-_

portive of me since I’ve come here. I’ve felt as if Dr.
Levine has had an open—door policy for me. I try not to
use it too much, because my responsibility as depart-
ment chair is to take care of as many issues as possible
and not bump them up to the dean. . c

How did you get into medicine as a career?» I
I grew up in inner—city— Philadelphia. My parents

were Jamaican immigrants who ran a rescue mission .

within sixiblocks of the Ben Franklin Bridge. Four nights
a week and on weekends, we would serveihot meals to"
homeless people. On Saturday mornings I ran the thrift
shop,'whereI would sell used clothing to people from
the community. We were ‘ministering to the physical

. and spiritual needs of the community, butwhat became

apparent to me early on was that these people had
terrible health. They were coughing, they had skin
problems," they were weak.

.VVhen I wasa middle school student, my dad ap-
proached several inner-city Philadelphia medical schools,
struggling to convince one of them to establish a clinic
in our mission. It was a large facility and we had the
space, but no one was interested. These medical schools
told my dad that their mission, when it came to the
underserved, was to send their students overseas to see
what life was likesin undeveloped countries. They said
there was no reasonjfor people in the United States to be
in the condition that [the poor in Philadelphia] were in
if they didn’t want to be. I was horriﬁedto hear that. As

an early adolescent, I thought, “VVhen I grow up, I’m
going to go into medicine so I can help to meet the needs »

of the underserved.”

I was president of the Future Physicians Club at my
high school. I went to Penn as an undergrad, majoring
in medical technology because I wasn’t convinced that I
was going to get into medical school. I knew that, at the
end of four years and all of the expenditures of going to
college,.I needed to be able to_get_a job. I worked part-
time throughout my undergraduate career as a medical
technologist at a research lab. ,

I’m one of six children, all born within a period of
eight-and-a—half years, so we were struggling. Educa-
tion was highly prioritized by our parents, but they told
us we had to ﬁgure out how to pay for it. I decided I
would join ROTC because that was a system that, for
yearsthad served as ‘a wgay for African Americans to

Bill would help to pay for your education, plus you had
a job with health beneﬁts and work experience that

' would stand you in good stead for the rest of your life.

Three of us six children went into the military. I am
forever grateful for the opportunities that came to me
through a military career. I came to the University of
Pittsburgh on an Army scholarship.

VVhat did you think of Pittsburgh and Pitt’s medical

school? '
During the interview process, I was delighted. In

Philadelphia, opportunities in health care education

A were divided among six medical schools. Here, I thought: -

The University of Pittsburgh is the only medical school
in the city. It’s the biggest health center in western
Pennsylvania. What a wonderful opportunity!

Once I actually matriculated as a medical student, my
vision changed. I realized I was an outsider, not just
because I came from eastern Pennsylvania butbecause I
was a person of color. And, by the way, there were no
other people of color in my class besides African Ameri-
cans. We didn’t have Hispanics, Asians or Native Ameri-
cans. There were seven of us African Americans in a class
of 140 when I matriculated. By the end of the ﬁrst year,
three were already dis-enrolled. I‘ I - '

It was difficult for me to find a place to live here. It
was only because a classmate of mine from Penn was

‘ from Pittsburgh and lived on the Hill that I was able to I

get the room that Ierented for my ﬁrst two years. I tried V

to rent apartments in Oakland — that’s another story,

the things people said to me when I wastrying to rent
apartments. This was in the, 19705!

In general, it was not a welcoming environment for
African Americans in the medical school. then. I had
faculty members tell me outright that I was only here so
that Pitt could get state capitation funds". They had been
required‘ to enrolla certain number of African Ameri-
cans and until they_had that enrollment, they couldn’t
get capitation funds. Well,‘ that’s particularly malignant
fora vulnerable student to hear. ’ ,

On the other hand, I felt that the education I received I s
here, especially in the clinical years, was superb. I said: A
“I’m going to graduate from this school with a good
medical education but  don’t ever want to see this city

, again.” - s

Those faculty members you encountered as a medi-
cal student — are any of them still here?

UNIVERSITY TIMES

nominate staff mem-
bers for this year’s

T

. Chancellor’s Distinguished Ser-

vice Award for Staff, the highest
award that Pitt grants to staff
members. The award is offered
in recognition of staff contribu-
tions to the University through
job performance and commu-
nity service. The deadline for
nominations is Oct. 31.

According to Robert G.
Houston of Student Affairs, who
chairs the awards committee,
“This award shows that the chan-
cellor recognizes staff as vital
both with regard to the quality
of this institution and the high-
quality contributions staff make
to the surrounding community,
with community service, charity

,work and so forth. It’s also a
great opportunity for staff to rec-
ognize their peers by nominat-
ing them.” .

First awarded in 1997, the
staff award parallels the three
annual awards given to faculty
for distinguished teaching, re-
search and public service. Up-to
ﬁve $2,500 staff awards are
granted annually. Winners are
recognized at the University’s
annual honors convocation and

with a listing of their names on a .

permanent plaque in the Will-
iam Pitt Union. The awards are

system that has changed dramatically over the lastifew answers. Hence, the interest in tele-medicine and other
communication technologies to help keep them linked.

here’s still time. to ,

expected to be announced in
December at the annual long-
term staff recognition ceremony.
1 Houston has chaired the
awards committee for four years.
“Typically, the ‘vast majority of
nominations pour in in the last
few days. I think the ﬁrst year we
had the award there were in the

neighborhood of 70 nomina-‘
tions. We’ve leveled off some.” 4

Rich Colwell, vice president
for steering of the Staff Associa-
tion Council (SAC) who has
served as an awards committee
member in the past, said, “There

‘ are some myths about the award

that should be corrected. First,
you can be nominated more than
once, even if you’ve won the
award in the past. Second, being
nominated and not-winning is
still an honor. I know there are
many outstanding staff around
who should be nominated even
if they don’t win. They deserve

that recognition.” He said SAC,

is looking for ways to honor staff
who were nominated but donot

win, perhaps with recognition in P

the SAC publication, “SAC
Tracks.” 1

Colwell said there had been
confusion in past years about
whether the committee consid-
ered job performance in its evalu-
ation of candidates. “The awards
committee considers outside-

staff have a fair amount to do
“because you are asked to pro-
vide veriﬁcation from organiza-
tions you’ve volunteered for.”
Houston said nominations
must include at minimum-a let-
ter thatidentiﬁes the wayanomi—
nee meets the award criteria and,

where possible, should include 1

supporting materials about the
nominee’s exceptional job per-
formance. .

“Once I get the nomination,
I send a letter thankingthe nomi-
nator, and I contact the nominee
to provide any supporting mate-
rials from agencies or volunteer
organizations,” he said.

There are two main criteria
for the award, according to the
issued by the
chancellor’s ofﬁce. First, the can-

didate must have demonstrated a

“a consistent pattern of extraor-
dinary dedication to the Univer-
sity above and beyond the
candidate’s job responsibilities.”

Second, the candidate must have '
demonstrated voluntary service ,

activity at the University or in

years. It’s become more uniﬁed under the UPMC—HS
'1 o‘go", but there‘ are"‘mané3“7‘ people in the ‘syste’rn‘wl1'o’a1‘e*i'

the local community or with pro-
fessional organizations. ,
Barbara Mowery, president
of SAC, said that some consider-
ation had been given to request-
ing that the chancellor offer two
awards, one for exceptional job

performance and one for com-

munity service. “But job perfor-
mance is measured in so many

.ways and we couldn’t come up

with a common pattern for evalu-
ation,” Mowery said. “We will
talk about this at SAC and look
at how other universities do it.”
Houston said the Carnegie
Mellon has an annual “Andrew
Award” for staff based solely on
job performance. “Butwe have a
very viable process in place that
gives us latitude to recognize a
variety of contributions a staff
member makes, both at the Uni-
versity and outside it.” He added
that the key word in the _award’_s
title is “service.” 1 A

SOUTH-

CONTINUED FROM PA GE 3
- None of the ones who were abusive to me are,

fortunately! [laughing] A couple of the people who were ‘-

supportive are still here: Dr. Robert Connamacher, in
pharmacology, is still here, and Dr. Joel Marinstein,
who is a clinical faculty member in family medicine.‘Dr.
Bob Glew, who was a biochemist and was incredibly
supportive of me and other students of color, has since

left the University.

VVhat are your goals for the farnilyanedicine depart-
ment? . .

First of all, I’d like to see more medical students
going into family practice. I think it’s a wonderful
discipline that is the best way to provide comprehensive,
compassionate, continuous care for our patients. We

should be more than just the access point into the

system, we should be the way to provide long-term,

' ongoing care for our patients. If you take a population of

1,000 people, fewer than ﬁve will ever need tertiary care.

We can’t just take care of the person who walks
through our door. We have a public health responsibil-
ity to disseminate information about how to stay healthy
— and if you do need to see a physician, to partner in
assuring that you regain your health. So, I’d like to make
sure that we teach that to our medical students, and that
a large percentage of them go into family medicine.

If they choose to go into other disciplines, which are

equally important, I want them to understand who_

family physicians are, that we can partner with our
neurosurgery colleagues, with our pediatric and ortho-
paedic colleagues and so forth, in providing care to
patients and continuing to provide care even while they
are seeking consultative services from other disciplines.

Aside from our educational mission, we have a schol—.
arly mission to add to the knowledge base of providing
health care to our population. I think family physicians
are uniquely positioned to do that. We can do research
in public health, in thephysician—patientrelationship, in
prevention —— all of those things that are best—suited to
‘our discipline.

In a larger sense, I’d like to see much more collabo-
ration within the [Pitt health center] system. This is a

4

not accustomed to working together. As an outsider
coming in, I’d like to see more collaboration so we can
have economies of scale. If there are certain clinical or

' teaching models that work well, everybody in the system

should be able to take advantage of them. a a

Who goes into family medicine? ’ t

We are a group of individualswho are comfortable
with uncertainty. The majority of our patients don’t
come in and say something specific like, “I have acute’
hepatitis C and I may very well need a liver transplant
but until that time I need you to help me stay healthy.”
The typical family medicine patientsays, “I don’t feel
good, and I haven’t felt good for a long time,” -and they
tell you what’s going on in their lives. We have to be-
comfortable hearing stories and we need strong inter-
viewing skills. We have to be able to ferret out from a
wealth ‘of uncertainty what the particular issues that are
most problematic to thatpatient are, and then to deter-
mine which priorities we can manage and which ones
need more specialized management. ‘

Do family medicine practitioners feel a kinship with”
public health practitioners, in favoring preventive
medicine? 5 _ S A . -
Absolutely a kinship. More than 90 percent of health
care spending in this country goes to people with less
than two years to live, because we can provide incredibly
high—tech services to them. Yet, if we could concentrate '

more on prevention, we would save money in the health 4

system. As we structure our curricula in medical schools
and training programs, we need to attend to issues of

comrnunity health as well as individual health so we can 1

keep people from more serious conditions.

Pennsylvania, like most other states, has problems
getting M.D.s to practice in rural‘ and inner-city
areas. Do you have any thoughtson solving that
problem? ' I i
, I think it’s a multi-focal problem. We don’t tend to
value people who deliver care to the underserved. We
tend to say that those in the bigger teaching centers are
better docs and deserve to be paid more. \/Vhereas, when
you look at people who deliver care in underserved
areas, they tend to work very long hours,~to be juggling
multiple issues with fewer resources. Don’t they deserve
adequate if not greater reimbursement? Money is not
everything, but it is very important. I think we also need
to link providers in rural areas with their colleagues so
that when they have questions, they have a way of getting

Can the civilian health care system learn anything
from tl1e“rnilitary’s? ‘ _ _ A. ‘ _ A _
Absolutely. I was very comfortable practicing in the
military, for a, number of reasons. First, there is a team
concept: Wevare here to help each other because we are
all working for a uniﬁed mission, and our mission as
medical corps ofﬁcers is to take care of, and ensure_ the
health of, the military community. Everything you do
has to have that concept in mind.'.Yoi1r personal self-
aggrandizement has to come second to ‘ensuring the
well-being of those you work.with. - I _ I '

_ You are taught in military leadership schools; Asa
leader, you eat last, you do things last, you make sure that
‘your team is cared. for beforeyou get your personal
kudos. As aresult, when you work on any project there

is a natural collaborative environment. That doesn’.t , '

mean there is not appropriate recognition for individu-

als who have demonstrated certain qualities and skills.

But your ultimate goal is to care for the community.
Because ofhigh turnover in the military and ‘the need

i to respond rapidly to crises, you learn to think outside of

the box. You can’t say, “We’ve gotta do it this ‘way
because we’ve always done it this way.” Rather,’ yousay:
“What is the issue now, and how can we most rapidly
address those issues?” A

Is there truth to the cliche that the military is the
American institution that is closest to being color-
blind? V 1’ - I . 1 ’ I

I think there is truth to that. It’s been said that the

. Army is the only corporation in the United States that

has managedto thoroughly integrate African Americans.
with whites and members of other races. If you think

i about it,.even when African Americans are employed by
corporations, they tend not to be in charge. That’s a.

commentarynon race relations in this country, which are
in pretty-sad shape, to be honest. When Sept. 1 1‘ came,

it was a tragic event but it pulled us together as Ameri- 1

cans. I don’t presume to think, though, that that feeling
will last long enough to eliminate the racial struggles
that havebeen typical of our country for the last 150
years. a - ‘

Do you have any time frame inrmind for how long
you’d like to stay at Pitt? 1

I don’t know. As long as I’m happy and feel thatl have
a mission I have a reasonable chance of accomplishing.
If I feel as if it’s going nowhere, I’m not theptypie of
person who wants to stay and bang my head against the
wall. I like to see progress. V 1’ I

OCTOBER 25,2001

Lecturer details Leonard Bernstein’s
multifaceted, multinational career

hen American
musical genius
L e o n a r d

Bernstein died in 1990, some
obituary writers, including those

* in The New York Times and

Baltimore Sun, suggested that
Bernstein had spread himself too
thin, and should have focused on
one area of music.

“My question to them is:

' Which area would you have had

him sacriﬁce? Pianist? Teacher?
Conductor? Composer? He ex-
celled at all of , them,” said a
slightly perturbed Ken Meltzer,
Pittsburgh Symphony commu-
nity spokesperson.

An unabashed admirer of
Bernstein’s, Meltzer referred to
the dynamic musician alternately
as “one of the great musical
teachers of his era,” “a first-class
concert pianist,” “a podium gi-
ant” and “among the top Ameri-
can composers” in his lecture,
“The Career ofMaestro Leonard
Bernstein.” The Oct. 18 lecture
was co-sponsored by the Jewish
Studies Program and the Israel
Heritage Nationality Classroom
committee. Meltzer punctuated
his lecture with video and audio
tapes of Bernstein’s multi—fac—
eted career, including his leg-
endary debut as a conductor at
age 2 5 when he ﬁlled in on a few
hours’ notice for the principal
conductor of the New York Phil-
harmonic.

Meltzer, said that Bernstein

almost did not pursue music be: 1

cause his immigrant father,

Samuel, opposed it. The elder
Bernstein had seen musicians in
Eastern Europe barely eking out
a living, sometimes playing for
change in the streets. No son of
his would do that, Meltzer said.
Samuel, who had a successful
beauty supply business, tried to
dissuade Leonard from studying
music, actually forbidding his son
from playing the piano at home.
The young Leonard would sneak
off to a neighbor’s house to prac-
UCC. .

(Meltzer said, “Later, the fa-
ther explained, ‘How did I know
he was going to become Leonard
Bemstez'n?’’9

‘ Born in Lawrence, Mass., in
1918, Bernstein took piano les-
sons in high school and was
trained in the classical piano at
Harvard in the mid- 1 93 Os. In his
undergraduate days he composed
and performed incidental piano
music. He continued his piano
studies at Curtis Institute of
Music in Philadelphia, where he
also studied conducting and or-
chestration.

“Although he was best known
as a conductor and composer,
Bernstein continued to perform
as a pianist throughout his ca-
reer, often conducting while he
was the soloist for piano concer-
tos,” Meltzer said.

Bernstein also was devoted to
teaching throughout his life. His
grandfather was a rabbi, and the

self—effacing B ernstein acknovs/l— _

edged-‘his own‘rabbini'caI"st’1‘eak,’
Meltzer said. “He said of him-

Expert advises on how to handle the ﬂu

When temperatures drop,
cold and ﬂu season is not far
behind, a Pitt expert said.

Ted Delbridge, assistant pro-
fessor of emergency medicine at
the School of Medicine and
medical director at UPMC
Presbyteria_n’s emergency de-
partment, offered advice on how
to prepare for the cold and ﬂu

. season.

“The ﬂu and common cold
have similar symptoms, but are
not the same,” Delbridge said.
“People with colds usually expe-
rience congestion and sneezing,
body aches and fatigue. People
with the ﬂu often have more se-
vere body aches and fatigue, plus
a fever, sore throat and cough-
in .”

The ﬂu can be transmitted
easily through sneezing and
coughing. It -spreads quickly in
enclosed spaces, such as class-
rooms and offices. Symptoms
typically show up about two to
four days after exposure and in-

’ dividuals usually are contagious

for another three to four days
after symptoms appear.
According to Delbridge, ﬂu
sufferers should drink plenty of
water, rest as much as possible
and take aspirin or acetami-
nophen to relieve fever and pain.
(But do not give aspirin to chil-
dren.) .
“Individuals should contact a
doctor with any of the following
symptoms: high fever, chills, se-
vere headache, lingering cough
(more than a week) or coughing
up colored sputum, chest pain or

shortness of breath.

, Delbridge advised: “Exercis-
ing, eating well, sleeping well,
talcingvitamins and washingyour
hands frequently are a few of the
ways you can stay healthy and
avoid the ﬂu.” He recommended
an annual ﬂu shot to decrease

risk.

self, ‘I tend to be lecturey. I love
to teach, butI don’t want to bore
anyone}

“Actually, he was one of the
great teachers of his era. In addi-
tion to the pre—concert lectures
with the New York Philhar-
monic, he taught at Tanglewood
[the Boston Symphony
Orchestra’s summer home] for
many years. He gave a series of
lectures at Harvard in the early
1970s, and, what he was most

proud of, the Young People’s

Concerts series, with the New
York Philharmonic,” which ran
14 seasons. Many concerts in the
series were televised in the 1960s,
introducing adolescent baby-
boomers to classical music.

“His great teaching genius
was to take complex ideas and
distill them into common lan-
guage. And important among
Bernstein’s teaching techniques
was his ability to laugh at himself
and to make music fun,” Meltzer
said.

Meltzer interspersed his re-
cap of some of Bernstein’s career
highlights with the maestro’s
own descriptions, including his
conducting debut with the New
York Philharmonic on Nov. 14,
1943. Bernstein recalled, “I had
been at a party until 3 or 4 in the
morning. I awoke with a hang-
over. I was informed "at 9 a.m.
that I had to conduct the 3 p.m.
concert; no time for rehearsal.”

u Meltzer. Said: “He. .h3,§....,.1.1£¥S..P.. 
- conducted a full program, and

this was going live on coast—to—
coast radio from Carnegie Hall.”

Bernstein recalled, “VVhen
the announcement was made that
I was replacing Bruno Walter,

» there were groans from the au-

dience. There was light applause
when I took the podium. The
ﬁrst three chords were like a great
electrical shock.”

Meltzer said, “He knew the
orchestra was with him from that
moment on.”

Bernstein said, “I don’t re-
member the performance. I
heard it later on tape.”

Meltzer pointed out, “The
next day, a rave review of his

debut made The New York
Times front page. Rather ex-
traordinary. The point is, he had
the opportunity, but he also had
the talent to take advantage of it.
He was the podium giant of his
time; of all time, really. He com-
bined technical mastery, inter-
pretive creativity and the ability
to take chances.”

Seemingly from that day for-
ward, Bernstein was in demand
as a guest conductor. In 1946, he
conducted in London and
Prague; in 1947, he conducted
in Tel Aviv. In 195 3, he was the
first American to conduct opera
at Milan’s La Scala. In 195 8, he

was named music director of the

New York Philharmonic and .

later held the title laureate con-
ductor for life. More than half of
his 400—plus recordings were
made with that orchestra.
According to Meltzer,
Bernstein generally preferred to
be considered as a peer of the
members of the orchestra when
he conducted, with few excep-
tions. One such exception was
the April 6, 1962 performance
of Brahms’s ﬁrst Piano Concerto
in D-minor with Canadian pia-

‘ nist Glenn Gould as soloist.

Bernstein told the audience
before the performance. “I feel I
have to say we have a curious
situation: Mr. Gould offers a dis-
tinctively different interpreta-
tion, which I consider to be a
severe departure from Brahms’s

. [intentions]. But, Mr. Gould is

so valid and serious an artist, that
I take it on good faith that his
interpretation is worthy of per-
formance. It does raise an age-

sometimes the othir.dUsi}ilall1y a
compromise is reac e ,w et er
through persuasion, charm or
threats.

“This [situation] has only
ha ened to me once before, and

PP _
that was the last time I conducted
for Mr. Gould,” Bernstein said,
to much laughter from the audi-
ence.

As a composer, Bernstein had
few American equals, Meltzer
said. “If Bernstein had composed
only ‘West Side Story,’ he would
be justiﬁablyranked among ths
great American composers,
Meltzer said. “But there were

also three symphonies, the op-
era ‘Candide,’ numerous show
tunes and chamber works,” and
that just scratches the surface.

“He incorporated both popu-
lar and classical elements in many
of his compositions, including in
‘West Side Story’ with its oper-
atic staging put to great popular
effect, using operatic techniques,
ensemble singing. In a play, if six
people are speaking at once you
have cacophony. In an opera you
have a sextet.”

Bernstein’s ﬁrst symphony,
“Jeremiah,” debuted in Pitts-
burgh in 1943, with the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra con-
ducted by the composer.

: He also composed the score
for “On the Waterfront,” the
1954 Academy Award winning
film. He earned a Tony award
and a Lifetime Achievement
Grammy Award.

Reflecting his versatility,
Bernstein received many national
and international awards includ-
ing the Israel Philharmonic Life-
time Laureate Conductor desig-
nation, the London Symphony
Orchestra title of Honorary
President, the American Acad-
emy of Arts and Letters Gold
Medal, the Beethoven Society
medal, the Handel Medallion
and dozens of honorary degrees
and awards from universities.

“He was made an honorary
lifetime conductor by the Vienna
Symphony Orchestra, quite a
designation for an American,
especially a Jewish American,”

Meltzer said.
National honors came from
Italy, Mexico, Denmark, Ger-

Kennedy’ Center for the Per-
forming Arts honors.

Throwin 1 1 Emmys for good
measure.

Bernstein called himself, ‘a
musician in the true sense of the
word,’ Meltzer said. “He said:
‘Music has always consumed me.
I want to teach, to perform, to
conduct, to compose, and I think
I can do justice to them all.’ Be-
fore Bernstein, I think’ it was
generally conceded that America
did not have music on a par with
the Europeans. He may have felt
he was a musician of the world,
but I think he was America’s mu-
sician.”

Epidurals safe
for women of
all sizes

There is no relationship be-
tween the size of a patient and
the occurrence of epidural fever,
according to a study presented
Oct. 15 by Pitt researchers at the
annual meeting of the American
Society of Anesthesiologists.

Researchers also found that
there was no relationship be-
tween occurrence of epidural
fever and the length of epidural
anesthesia. Maternal tempera-
tures may increase in healthy
women who have received lum-
bar epidural anesthesia — a con-
dition called epidural fever.

“Epidural anesthesia is safe
for both the mother and the baby
and can make the birthing expe-
rience much more positive,” said
Helene Finegold, Pitt assistant
professor of anesthesiology and

irig that the size of the patient
has no relation to" the chance of
epidural fever, we can reassure
our patients that they are not
putting themselves or their ba-
bies at an increased risk by being

larger or smaller than average.”

Pregnant
women should
take extra
precautions
while driving,
riding in cars

Motor vehicle crashes involv-
ing pregnant women are the lead-
ing cause of traumatic fetal death,
researchers from Pitt’s Center
for Injury Research and Control
(CIRCL) reported in the Oct. 16
Journal of the American Medi-
cal Association. While they
found the detected number of
deaths to be disturbing, research-
ers also suggest their data sub-
stantially underestimates the
problem. ,

Based on their ﬁndings, the
authors urge automotive indus-
try and highway transportation
safety ofﬁcials to search for ways
to reduce crash risks and im-
prove the safety of pregnant
women and their fetuses while
driving or riding in motor ve-
hicles.

“There is an urgent need to
better understand how to pro-
tect pregnant women by reduc-
ing crash risk, and if they are in a
crash, how to better protect
women and fetuses,” said Harold
B. Weiss, associate director of
CIRCL, assistant professor of

neurological surgery and lead-

author of this study. “Further-
more, without better case iden-
tiﬁcation, the magnitude and
trends of the problem, who is at

the highest risk, remain difﬁcult

states’ fetal death certiﬁcates
from 1995 to 1997, representing
5 5 percent of the U.S. live births
during the study, and approxi-
mately 15,000 fetal death regis-

trations per year. Any fetal death
of at least 20 weeks’ gestation as
a result of an in utero traumatic
injury either to the fetus or
mother was considered a case of
traumatic fetal death. Out of the
240 traumatic fetal deaths iden-
tiﬁed from these records, motor
vehicle crashes were the leading
cause of maternal injury related
to the fetal death, representing
82 percent of the cases with listed
causes.

This is the ﬁrst population-
based study that looks at all causes
of traumatic fetal death. It sup-
ports the claim that the annual
number of fetal motor vehicle-
related deaths, conservatively
estimated inthis article at more
than 369 (after partial adjust-
ment for missed cases), far ex-
ceeds the number of infant mo-
tor vehicle—related deaths in the
U.S., which averages about 180
deaths per year.

To put these numbers into
context: The ATX and Wilder-
ness AT Firestone tires recalled
last year have been associated
with 123 deaths of all ages over a
several year period. The Cen-.
ters for Disease Control and Pre-
vention reported that in 1998,
376 infants died from uninten-
tional suffocation causes, 63 from
unintentional drowning, 43 from
ﬁres and burns, 9 from poison-
ings and 5 from ﬁrearms.

Because state fetal death reg-
istries usually don’t code or com-
puterize the circumstances of
maternal injury, to assemble a

Controversy threatens funding
of Pitt Environmental Law Clinic

think we will get the green light.”
But in an interview yester-

day, Maher and N ordenberg said

the real reason they won’t let the

Environmental Law Clinic ap-

proach the Hillman and R.K.
"Mellon foundations —— or other

local foundations that have sup-
ported the University over the
years -—— is that Pitt’s administra-
tion already helped the clinic get
a $2 million Heinz Endowment
grant last year, and now it’s other
units’ turn to approach prime
funding sources.

“They [the Environmental
Law Clinic] are not going to get
the green light no matter w/mt
they do,” said Maher. “They’re
too far down on our priority list
now. We have to prioritize which

ers over Pitt professors’ involve-
ment in anti-logging lawsuits
dates back at least to 1997.
That year, law professors
Jules Lobel and William
Luneburg helped environmen-
talists ﬁle a lawsuit to stop a
logging project in the Allegheny
National Forest. Bill Slocum,
then a state senator representing
Warren County, declared that
Pitt should not get “one more
cent” of state money until it set
policies governing faculty who
do outside work — using Uni-
versity resources — that con-

‘ ﬂicts with the interests of state

units can approach foundations,” -

so foundations are not inundated
with conﬂicting or overlapping

requests from Pitt, the provost

said. “That process is organized
through my ofﬁce and the Office
of Institutional Advancement.”
Maher said the Environmen-
tal Law Clinic was given high
priority early in Pitt’s current
$500 million capital campaign,
and many other units — includ-
ing other School of Law clinics
—-— now are awaiting permission
to approach foundations.’
I The provost added, however,
that he encourages all Univer-

new sources outsidethe region.

Nordenberg, a former Pitt
law dean, pointed out: “It’s a
$500 million, campaign. This
one, small program [the Envi-
ronmental Law Clinic] in one
school already has received $2

:~lo~.vi-—

million of that $500 million from I

one of our best foundation
friends. I think those numbers
are telling.” A

Pitt’s Environmental Law
Clinic was founded last year to
give law students practical expe-
rience on environmental cases.

residents. Slocum noted that fac-
ultyworking as private individu-
als used Pitt stationery in their
pro bono work on the lawsuit.
Pitt administrators, law fac-
ulty and legislators. worked out a
compromise through which pro-
fessors were barred in the future
from using University resources
for pro bono work. “But we al-
ways knew,” Chancellor

N ordenberg said yesterday, “that "

the underlying tensions were
more basic, with people in that
area feeling that their depen-
dency on timbering for such ba-
sic purposes as funding public
schools should not be interfered
with by faculty members at a
state-funded institution.”

Last May, state lawmakers

Allegheny Defense Project, a
group opposed to logging in the
Allegheny National Forest. The
clinic subsequently dropped the
case, and clinic director Buchele
took it on privately. -

“I played ball with the Uni-
versity administration on that,”
Buchele said. “I agreed to take
the Allegheny National Forest
case on my own, and It received
assurances that the administra-
tion was very happy with me for
doing so. Then they turned
around and did this” — i.e., be-
gan charging the clinic for ad-
ministrative/ overhead costs.

criticized Pitt’s Environmentalm

According to Luneburg of
Pitt’s environmental law pro-
gram, avoiding controversial

cases will undermine the Envi- I‘

ronmental Law Clinic’s mission.

“Tom [Buchele] and the clinic
provide legal advice to environ-
mental groups that can’t afford
to pay for representation. That’s
the whole point of the clinic, and
the University has known from
the outset the kinds of cases it
would be taking on,” Luneburg
said. .

Law Dean Herring defended
Pitt’s administration against ac-

cusations it is selling out the clinic '

to appease legislators and busi-
ness interests. “The University
administration has supported the
clinic every step of the way,” the
dean wrote to Luneburg and sev-
eral other law professors. “They
have not backed off from de-
fending academic freedom and
the principles of the legal pro-
fession and legal education.”
Nordenberg estimated that,
over the last four years, Pitt rep-
resentatives “have been involved
in literally hundreds of interac-
tions relating to activities of the
[Environmental Law] Clinic and
individual faculty members,
ranging from phone calls with
legislators to formal presenta-

university of

tions at our annual appropria-
tion hearings.

“I would doubt,” Nordenberg
continued, “if one could find an
example of a university adminis-
tration that has done more to
protect a school and its involved
faculty members in the face of
demands for punitive action and
forms of control that we believe
are inappropriate.”

The adrninistration’s defense
of the clinic has cost Pitt ﬁnan-
cially, the chancellor said. For
example, a $150,000—$Z00,000
project to create a biology data-
base at Pitt’s Bradford campus
“simply disappeared, as elected
ofﬁcials from that area withdrew
their support in light of their
concerns about the University’s
environmental activities,”
N ordenberg said.

“But more importantly, the
price has come in terms of op-
portunities that you can’t suc-
cessfully pursue when all of your
governmental relations activities
are focused on defending against
attacks coming your way.”

By this year, those attacks
were coming not just from a
handful of legislators in north-
western Pennsylvania, Nor-
denberg said. “When the pro-
vost and I met earlier this year
with legislators on this issue,
there were at least 20, maybe 25
of them in the room.”

Maher said he—senses “a gen-
eral assumption in the [Environ-
mental Law] Clinic that we will
handle this —meaning thatMark

g and I will go to Harrisburg and

Pittsburgh

make everything all right.” But
Pennsylvania lawmakers seem
“grimly determined” to pursue
the issue, Maher said.

“We can’t assume that the
situation won’t get worse, that
the next step [by the legislature]
won’t be something more puni-
tive than we saw this year,” the
provost said. “We need the
clinic’s help with creative solu-
tions. It’s a very difﬁcult situa-
tion if they are not prepared to
be helpful in ﬁnding a way to
provide for the future needs of
the clinic.”

Maher said: “We’ve studied
what’s going on all over the coun-
try and we haven’t found a state
university yet that has been able
to run an environmental law
clinic totally in-house. But there
are state universities with very
good environmental law clinics
that have been rolled into inde-
pendent, non—proﬁt corpora-
tions, units that became allies in
running the kind of good envi-
ronmental law program that we
want to run through our law
school.”

Buchele replied: “I assume

~ [Pitt administrators] are think-

ing of someplace like the Uni-
versity of Oregon, where the
environmental law clinic was
chased out of the law school and
is now run as a public interest
law ﬁrm. That’s one precedent.
But I would suggest that they
also think about Rutgers, which
has successfully kept a clinic in-
house.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

PEOPLE OF THE TIIVIES

David Roodman, an inter-
nationally renowned researcher
in multiple myeloma and bone
marrow culture techniques, has
joined the University of Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute (UPCI)
as director of the Multiple My-
eloma Center.

Roodman also has been ap-
pointed professor of medicine at
the Pitt medical school’s divi-
sion of hematology/oncology
and director of UPMC Health
System’s Center for Bone Biol-
0 .
At UPCI, Roodman will in-
vestigate multiple myeloma, a
cancer of the plasma cells that
play a vital role in the body’s
immune defenses. Most patients
with multiple myeloma die
within three to ﬁve years of diag-
nosis.

In addition to its low survival
rates, multiple myeloma has a
devastating impact on patients’
quality of life because it causes
the bones to weaken and erode,
which in turn causes pain and/ or
fractures that can affect patients’
ability to move.

Roodman’s research also will
focus on Paget’s disease, the sec-
ond most common bone disease
diagnosed in the United States.
Surpassed only by osteoporosis,
it affects approximately 2 mil-
lion Americans. In Paget’s dis-
ease, bone tissue is formed ab-
normally, resultingin weakened
and deformed bones. While
Paget’s disease is not a cancer
and is rarely fatal, it shares symp-
toms with multiple myeloma, in-
cluding pain, deformity and dis-
ability.

Current treatments for both
multiple myeloma and Paget’s
disease address only symptoms.

degeneration (AMD) and its as-
sociated vision loss. These ﬁnd-
ings, from the nationwide Age-
Related Eye Disease Study
(AREDS) clinical trial, are re-
ported in the October 2001 issue
of Archives of Ophthalmology.
Researchers from 11 centers
nationwide, including ophthal-

B mologists from Pitt’s School of

Medicine, found that people at
high risk of developing advanced
stages of AMD lowered their risk
by about 2 5 percent when treated
with a hi gh—dose combination of
vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-caro-
tene (antioxidants), and zinc. In
the same high—risk group, the
supplements reduced the risk of
vision loss caused by AMD by
about 19 percent.

' For study participants who
had either no AMD or early

AMD, the supplements did not i

provide an apparent beneﬁt.
“AMD is the leading cause of
vision impairment and blindness
in Americans over the age of 50,
and up until this point we have
been limited in our treatment

options,” said Pitt ophthalmol-
ogy professor Thomas R.
Friberg, principal investigator
of the trial here and chief of
retina services, UPMC Health
System. “By showing the posi-
tive beneﬁts of these dietary
supplements, we have established
the first effective treatment
proven to slow the progression
of AMD.”

“While numerous claims are
made for -various over-the-
counter drugs for the treatment
of AMD, in reality, the effective-
ness of such supplements for the
treatment of AMD remain
largely unproven. The AREDS
study was so large and compre-
hensive that there is no doubt
that a major breakthrough has
taken place. No other formula-
tions and supplements for the
prevention of AMD have been
so convincingly proven to be ef-
fective,” said Friberg.

The AREDS study was spon-
sored by the National Eye Insti-
tute (NEI), one of the National
Institutes of Health. I

ROBERT S. TOTTEN LECTURE _
“Pancreatic Cancer:- From Genes to Patient Care” .
Ralph H. Hruban, M.D., Professor of Pathology and Oncology _
‘ The Johns Hopkins Medical Institution

Baltimore, MD

Wednesday, November 14, 2001

4:00 p.m.

Scaife Hall, Lecture Room 5

Dr. Hruban is the Robert S. Totten Lecturer for 2001 sponsored by the Department of

Pathology. Dr. Hruban’s lab has appliedgmolecular genetic advances to the study of -
I precursor lesions in the pancreas and demonstrated a sequence of genetic alterations

associated with increasing grades of histologic dysplasia in incipient pancreatic neo-

plasia. This work has established a progression model for pancreatic neoplasia; just as .

there is a progression from adenoma to carcinoma in the colorectum, so too his lab has
established the histologic and genetic progression of pancreatic ductalproliferations
(so called “PanINs”) to invasive pancreatic cancer. This progression model suggests a
novel_ approach to the early detection of pancreatic cancer screening for the genetic
alterations with a high propensity to progress to infiltrating cancer._ This progression
model also suggests that early precursor lesions in the pancreas might be reasonable
targets for the chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer.

Dr. Hruban is also trying to use the molecular discoveries to develop new tools to aid
in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and to advance the understanding of familial
pancreatic cancer. He has developed a sensitive and specific immunohistochemical
assay for DPC4 gene inactivation and has characterized a previously unrecognized
type of pancreatic cancer (medullary cancer) that not only has a distinct morphologic
appearance, but also is associated with specific genetic alterations. He has also spear-
headed efforts to understand why pancreatic cancer aggregates in some families and

in 1994 established the highly successful National Familial Pancreas Tumor Registry

(http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas_NFPTR).

Please plan to attend a reception in Dr.‘Hruban’s honor immediately I

ments: the Oct. 15 Chancellor’s

University Update; a University .

community tip-she_et on proce-
dures for handling mail, and the
Oct. 19- edition of the newsletter

“UPMC Extral,” which touches

on issues of emergency prepared-
ness, procedures following a di-
saster, frequently asked questions
about anthrax, available Internet
resources and general security
and safety precautions. ,
Following the Oct. 13 Oak-

. land hoax, Chancellor Nor-

denberg issued a campus update.
He wrote, in part: “In the cur-
rent environment, each of us
must exercise appropriate cau-
tion even while we make certain
that fear does not depriveus of
the many satisfactions that come

. from full and active'lives....

“Our overriding concern is

for the health and safety of every. 1

member of the University com-
munity,” the chancellor wrote.

Regarding mail, the Univer-
sity distributed a notice on indi-
cators and procedures for han-
dling suspiciousipackages.

According to the tip—sheet,
indicators for suspicious letters
and parcels include: excessive
postage; incorrect titles; titles
without names; oily stains or dis-
coloration; rigid envelopes; re-
strictive markings, such as “con-
ﬁdential,” or “personal”; exces-
sive securing material, such as
masking tape, string, etc.; lop-
sided or uneven envelopes; no
return address, and poorly writ-
ten or typed envelopes.

The tip—sheet said that if any
of the indicators are present, an
expert should assess the letter or
package. Individuals should no-
tify the University Police of sus-
