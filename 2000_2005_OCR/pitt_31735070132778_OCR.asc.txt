Speaker gained
better self image
with bisexuality

BEN GREINER I -
Staff Writer ’

Although only about 35 Pitt stu-
dents showed up for nationally rec-
ognized speaker and activist Robyn
Ochs’ lecture Friday evening in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom, those
who attended learned a lot.

Ochs, who tours the nation to
speak to college students and other
groups, is not only an advocate for
gay and bisexual rights but is also an
advocate for women’s rights and
same-sex marriage. 

“Though women have a majority
of the world’s population, they

receive a minority of the-» world’s‘

resources,” ,Ochs said, noting how
she thinks ‘women are treated unfair-

Early in the lecture, ‘Ochs told
the group her personal definition of
bisexuality. I

“[Bisexuality is] acknowledging
in myself the potential to be attract-
ed to people of more than one sex,”

she said. “But not necessarily at the _

same time or in the same degree.”
Ochs went on to talk about how
at an early age, she hated her body
and thought the ideal women’s body
resembled those of Playboy Bunnies
and Barbie dolls. .
However, after she fell in love

‘with a woman in college, her per-

spective changed.

"I learned that women and their
bodies ‘V are beautiful,” Ochs said,
adding that that instance was a “light
bulb” moment in which she began to
View bodies as “miracles.”

Privilege differential, a term

Ochs used to describe the \differ-‘

ences between heterosexual and
homosexual relationships,‘ iwas
another topic discussed during the

 

William Ferguson was able to break up this pass, but Pitt couldpnot stop‘ the Trish

Gene—O—Ran1ateaches Internet can’t replace research

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

Henry J. Hotopp left Germany to avoid being
drafted into the army. When he arrived in
America, Hotopp decided to volunteer in the
Union Army to fight in the Civil War.

“It's all about choice,” said Barbara Braden
Guffrey, head, of publicity for the Western
Pennsylvania Genealogical Society on why
Hotopp avoided one army to serve in another.

Family history and ancestry was the order of
the day at Gene-O-Rama, an event hosted by
WPGS and the African American Historical and
Genealogical Society Saturday afternoon in the
Soldiers and Sailors War Memorial in Oakland,
as part of National Heritage. ',

The event offered information on how a per-

son can get started tracking her genealogy, with:

absolutely no prior experience. The event was
separated into booths by categories

different ethnic groups, such as “Italian” and
“African American.”

The Internet booth showed people how to use
the Web effectively, but Reed Powell, Web mas-
ter for WPGS, cautioned against the exclusive
use of and complete trust in the Internet as a
source. ,

“The Internet is grossly overrated,” Powell
said, adding that it does offer some help and ca
point people in the right direction. -

One of the resources the Web offers is cer-
tain census information, dating from about 1790

like ~
“Internet,” “Census,” and a variety of booths for

to 1930, when the government released its last
census.
Census information can be found at heritage-

quest.com and other sites dealing with genealo- ,

‘Powell suggested that people tracking and
researching their genealogies should begin with

the relatives that are still alive —,especially .

young people, who.
might still have grand-
parents, or even great-

grandparents, T from
whom they can obtain
information.

The census may not
help much, ‘though, as

 census information‘ WPGS
from the early period of Correspondence
the’ United States is Secretary
extremely vague. _ _ Rose laudoto,
' Oftgn, the ccnsus on the thrills.
just listed thehead of ofsenealogy

the household and the

' number of people: liv-

ing in it. Only later did
"the census keep track
of individual peopl‘e.‘:f ,
At the African American booth, African
American Historical and Genealogical Society
President Emily Davis spoke about some of the
unique problems that black Americans face in
tracing their family histories, especially to times
‘before the Civil War. .
The first census for black people in America

“It’s a rush.” I

was taken in 1866, and since some freed slaves
changed their names to reﬂect their new lives, it
may be extremely hard to find ancestors.

5‘It’s the thrill of the hunt to see what you can
find,” Davis said, describing how she feltabout
tracking her genealogy, which she began to do in
1992.‘ t
“It becomes a passion,” she added.

Diane Ragan, the president of WPGS,
also offered some advice for "beginners inter-
ested in tracing their genealogy.

“Start with yourself and work back-
wards,” she said, referring to the idea that
some people try to find the person as far
back in their ancestry as they can go, and
then attempt to work forward from that
point. ,‘

'Ragan also suggested _ using ‘family-
search.org, which is run by the Church of
Latter Day Saints. , ’ p

The church tracks countless numbers of

people, she said, and has obtained, informa-e

, tion thatmany find useful in the search for
their family histories. .
“When communism fell in eastern
Europe, they were the first ones there knock-
ing on the door’,’, Ragan said, referring to the

‘Church of Latter Day Saints, and members’

attempts to gather family history.

WPGS» Correspondence Secretary Rose
Laudoto also spoke about the excitement of
investigating genealogy.

“It’s a rush,” she said. “It’s the best hobby I«

have ever done.” =

Pitt prof stays healthy and

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

When the starting gun sounds in the
early morning hours ‘of Oct. 18 in the

— Hawaiian town of Kona, Joe Maroon

will be competing in one of the most
demanding endurance events on earth ——
the 25th annual Hawaiian Ironman

I E. Competition.

He will swim 2.4 miles in Kailua
Bay, bike a l12—rnile course that takes
him through the""mountains‘ and lava

ﬁelds of the Big Island and, ﬁnally, run

26.2 miles to the ﬁnish.
L He’s not a professional athlete. He
just operates on them.

You see, Joe is also known as Dr.
Joseph C. Maroon, a professor and vice
chairman of the department of neuro-
surgery at the Pitt’s Medical Center, as
well as team neurosurgeon for the

- Pittsburgh Steelers. He’s also 63 years

old. -
Dr. Maroon has competed for the
past 20 years in challenging endurance
events, including ﬁve Ironman distance
events in Canada, New Zealand,
Germany and the 1993 Hawaiian com-
petition.

He has been the team neurosurgeon
for the Steelers since 1981, where he
specializes in new methods of evaluating
sports—related concussions. He said he’s
received’ encouragement in his training
this year by friends and patients like
tight end Mark Bruener and quarterback
Tommy Maddox.

According to IronmanLive.com, the
official race Web site, athletes spend an

average of 18 to 24 hours each week

training for the race.

Over the past 8 months, Dr. Maroon
has taken as muchtime as possible out of
his work schedule, which also includes a
private practice to train for this one day.

He spent a couple of hours every

~moming swimming at the local pools

near his home in Sewickley. During
lunch he’d try to get a few miles of run-
ning in. On the weekends he’d dedicate
hours more, including taking long bike

“When I started ‘ training eight
months ago, I could run three miles, bike
20, and swim one,” he said. “After train-
ing, I can now run 20, bike 100, and
swim three.”

The secret to his progress is training
with what he calls “incremental consis-
tency.”

“If I had started with the regimen I _

have now, it would have killed me,” Dr.
Maroon said. '

First organized 25 years ago by‘

Navy Officer John Collins on the island
of Oahu, the Hawaiian Triathlon has,
according to the World Triathlon

Corporation, become known as one of
the ultimate one—day endurance events
on earth. Men and women, ranging in
age 18 to 80, come from more than 50
countries to compete.

The Hawaiian competition is also
the Ironman Triathlon World
Championship, with a $430,000 purse
split among the. overall top ten ﬁnishers.
The event has grown from 15 people in
February of "1978, with a winning time
of 11 hours, 46 minutes, to 1,500 people
last year, with a winning time of 8 hours,
29 minutes.

Dr. Maroon, who will compete in
the 60 to 64 age group, said that as he
has gotten older, Such endurance events
have taken on greater signiﬁcance in
maintaining his own health and the
philosophical importance he’s placed on
things in his life. A . * '

“It’s not about material things,
unless it’s a new bike you can train
with,” Dr. Maroon said. “You realize that
it’s your relationships with God, family,

friends, and colleagues that sustain you.” ‘

Triathlon participants qualify
through regional competitions held
around the country throughout the year,
and through a lottery that picks 150
more. _I

The U.S. military also sends a 5-
man, 1-woman team from each of its
branches to compete in the event.

Dr. Maroon qualiﬁed by cpmpleting
the Endurathon Half Ironman Race in
Muncie, Indiana, where he ﬁnished with
a time good enough to have him named
an All-American Triathlete by the sport’s
governing body, the National Triathlon
Association. ,

But it almost didn’t happen.

According to Dr. Maroon, he

wrecked his car on the way to Muncie
the night before the race. Unhurt, but
still a 45-minute drive from the starting
line, he eventually ﬂagged down a pass-
ing pick-up truck and hitched a ride with
some Michigan State students who were
also going to the event. After getting
only three hours of sleep, Dr. Maroon
found himself standing at the lakeside
starting line with a bad case of nerves.
0 “There was a tremendous anxiety
and apprehension for me before the
race,” he said. “As I was standing by the
lake watching the sun rise, I stopped and
said a prayer to God to give me
strength.”

“I ended up having my best Half
Ironman ﬁnish time ever,” he added.

Asked what he plans to do when he
crosses the ﬁnish line in Kona, Dr.
Maroonsaid he wouldn’t be doing any
immediate celebrating.

“I’ll head right over to the medical
tent and get hooked up to a ﬂuid I.V.,” he
said.

Older citizens bring down

state’s overall health average

ERIC SAPORITO
Staff Writer

Senior citizens in good. health do
have healthier lifestyles, according to
Pitt’s University Center for Social and

Urban Research.

But older residents in the Pittsburgh
region with poorer health also exhibit
healthier behavior, the center reported.

The commonwealth . of
Pennsylvania has the second oldest pop-
ulation, after Florida, in the United
States. This makes the Pittsburgh region
an ideal area to study the health of an
older population. ’ T

The older residents in Allegheny

. County outnumber the younger resi-
dents, according to an analysis by the

Center for Social and Urban Research
and the Graduate School 9f Public
Health. The survey, conducted from
June 2001 to May 2002, found the over-
all health of the region is lower than the
national average, largely because of the
higher percentage of older residents.

The individual statistics showed that
the Pittsburgh region was in line with
national averages. '

The older respondents to the survey
are more health conscious than their
younger counterparts. Those in the 75-

to 84-year-old age range had a ﬂu shot in
the last year. Also, a higher percentage of
women in the same age group had mam-
mograms and a higher percentage of
men had prostate exams.The report
found people who felt they were in poor
physical condition, along with people
who suffer mental or emotional prob-
lems, needed the most help with activi-
ties. The study found that people with
four or more chronic health conditions
and those with an annual income less
than $15,000 also required help with
household chores, medical assistance
and transportation. '

But good health and
practices do not necessarily go together.

“Poor health seems to result in

engaging in more healthy behavior, _

while excellent or good health does not
result in more healthy behaviors,”
according to the report, and there is more
improvement for healthier behavior.
The studies were made possible by a
research grant for The National Institute

_ of Health and the Allegheny County

Department of Human Services. The
Area Agency on Aging, the Center for
Minority Health, Department of
Psychiatry, Pitt’s Institute on Aging and
UPMC contributed support’ to ‘the
research.

lecture. Ochs said it was fine for her
to kiss and hold hands with a man in
public, but said she didn’t do the
same with women’ in public. She
thoughtthat by doing so, she was
“ﬂaunting her sexuality.”

Many people in the audience
nodded their heads in agreement
with Ochs when she spoke about
introducing same-sex partners to ‘her
family.

She said_her family-saw male
partners she brought home as “poten-
tial husbands” and were very cordial

with them, but did not extend the

same hospitality’ to female partners.

Regarding marriage, Ochs said
she wouldn’t consider a traditional
marriage until same-sex marriages
are legalized.

“I made a promise to myself that
I won’t marry a man until I can legal-
ly marry a woman,” Ochs_ said.

Ochs told the group that after her
first relationship with a woman, her
perspective concerning ‘ men
changed. She related the experience
to returning home to the United
States after studying abroad and see-

ing the country differently. I
Near the end of her talk, Ochs

made a statement that summed up the

sentiment of the evening.

“Being bisexual is a gift,” she
said.

After "speaking to the group,
Ochs led a ‘question and answer ses-
sion where students discussed the
lecture’s topics in great detail.

Pitt student Fabiola Torres’

thought Ochs did a great job of ‘

informing and helping students
understand theirisexual identities.

“I think sheopened everyone’s
eyes,” Torres said. “ I was amazed.”

The lecture, titled “Bisexuality,
Feminism, Men and Me” was hosted
by the Rainbow Alliance as part of
National Coming Out Week and was
preceded by a small workshop in

which Ochs spoke to students about 1
their sexual orientation and how they A

come to terms with it. ,

Ochs, a Boston resident, teaches
courses dealing with. gender roles,
bisexuality and sexual orientation at
Tufts University in Massachusetts.

lectures, can be found on her Web

THE PITT NEWS

Addition aids prevention, reaction to bio—terror

Specter, page 1

Human Services and Education, which
oversees federal health spending, also
talked about the new Strategic Medical
Intelligence Unit.

The SMIU is a coalition of volun-
teer, local medical professionals that
seeks to more quickly diagnose patients
and medical symptoms for signs of a
biological attack. Specter announced
that he will be seeking federal funding
for it. 

“This is a groundbreaking ceremony
and UPMC’s work on the Strategic
Medical Intelligence initiative is a
groundbreaking effort in and of itself,”

, he said. “UPMC is working with the

FBI, with their 50 plus centers, to coor-
dinate on planning to respond to an
attack with weapons of mass destruc-
tion.”

Specter was introduced by St.
Margaret Hospital’s President and CEO
David T, Martin, who thanked the
Senator and -UPMC Health System for
helping finance an expansion he called
“long overdue.” A

He said the construction would take
about a year and allow St. Margaret’s,
which he estimated has 33,000 annual
visits, to expand to 24 treatment rooms
and eight bays and serve communities"
all along the Allegheny River.

Calling the construction “two pro-
jects in one,” Martin talked about the
hospital’s increased emergency capacity
as well as the newfound capability to

“deal with the decontamination of an esti-

mated 1,400 bio—terror victims in a 24-
hour period.
“The second project [bio—terror

response] is not one that I’—m extremely

excited about,” he said, “but we need to
be prepared for bio—terrorism, nuclear,
chemical [attacks], and in such an event,
if that did occur, we would be prepar .”

Specter said Pennsylvanian hospi-
tals and fire and policedepartments are
in the beginning stages‘ of heightening
their ability to respond to a bio—terrorism

situation, adding that he spent the month '

of August touring the state’s “first
responders.” , V

He said that more has to be done by
local agencies to aid those larger nation-
al ones that have been created since
Sept. 11, 2001 for counter-terrorism.

“We have created the Department of
Homeland Security,” said Specter.
“We’ve appropriated 29 billion dollars,
but they have a great many responsibili-
ties; border patrol, and immigration, and
Coast Guard, but we really need to pay

' more attention to bio-terrorism.”

Specter said it is impossible to pre-
dict the likelihood of a bio-termr attack,
but he added that better protective mea-
sures must be sought.

‘ “We went throughthe color-coding

system, as you know, the country was

put on alert, and it was really counter-

productive, because you can’t keep peo-
ple on alert all the time,” he said. “It’s
like crying wolf, and when the wolf
finally comes nobody’s paying any
attention because you’re numbed by all
of the prior predictions.” _

Dr. Michael Allswede, chief of the
Special Emergency Response Section
for the UPMC Department of
Emergency Medicine and an expert on
bio—terrorism, expanded on some of the
specific biological dangers to which
Specter alluded. A

“A lethally communicable disease
like sma1l—pox or SARS or plague would
create the greatest challenges to man-
agement,” Allswede said. “Because not
only is it lethal if you have it, it also cre-
ates fear in those who do not, which cre-
ates the need to not associate with one
another.”

Allswede also said without taking
measures now, this fear of personal con-
tact during a bio—terror situation would
be “devastating” to certain institutions.

“[Emergency departments] which
depend on face-to-face communication,
the stock market, interstate Have], and
‘all forms of assembly would essentially
stop’ or be severely curtailed with that
sort of an environment, which truly is a
strategic threat to the nation, stopping
our face-to-face communication through
the , threat of infectious disease,”

Allswede said.

According to Allswede, SlVlIU
would help in making first responders
more prepared. '

“What our Strategic Medical
Intelligence organization is directed to

do is to create a better topography on the

local level so that local law enforce-
ment, local doctors and medical assets

can be more wisely directed toward the ~

threats that come and go in our local
areas.” -

Specter’s visit came on the same
day Vice President Dick Cheney said, in
a speech to The Heritage’ Foundation,
that certain terrorists are trying to gather
weapons of mass destruction to kill
many thousands of Americans “in a sin-
gle day of horror.”

This also comes on the heels of CIA
chief Iraqi weapons inspector David
Kay’s interim report on his first three
months of work, presented to the House
and Senate Intelligence Committees ‘on
Oct. 2. ' V

‘ Kay, who leads the 1,200-person
Iraq Survey Group, said, while the
group had found no chemical, nuclear or
biological weapons, they had discovered‘
evidence of a biological program.

’ ‘He said Iraqi scientists have come
forward with equipment, technology,
diagrams and documents and 97 vials of
reference strains and biological organ-
isms, including one strain Kay claimed
could be used to produce bio-weapons,
were found by his team concealed in the
home of an Iraqi scientist.

Pitt football has outgrown the Big East

The Big East isn’t so big any-
more, leaving Pitt football with a
weak, dilapidated group of peers,
which is an unfortunate situation for
the Panthers.

Boston College has accepted the
Atlantic Coast Conference’s offer to
join the ACC and leave behind the
wreckage that the Big East is becom-
ing. That leaves the Big East with
just five football teams, including
Pitt. _

Pitt should give up the dream of
salvaging the‘Big East as a football
conference that matters. There is no
need to try recruiting other schools
into the Big East to beef it back up.
They should look to go elsewhere —
perhaps the Mid-Atlantic Conference
—- for football, and concentrate on
being a powerhouse in the sports that
the Big East can lay a claim to excel-
lence in: men’s soccer, swimming,
and of course, basketball. Regardless
of the football situation, the Big East
is a great basketball conference, and
Pitt has a fantastic basketball pro-
gram. We should keep the basketball
team in the Big East and stay a big
fish in a big pond.

However, the Big East isn’t a
great football conference, and really
never has been. In recent history,
only Miami, Virginia Tech and
Syracuse have won conference cham-
pionships. Of the three, only Miami

has won a ‘national title ‘since the
inception of the Big East. The Big
East was created as a basketball con-
ference, to give ESPN something to
broadcast cheaply on Tuesday nights.
The addition of football was an after-

thought. ' . S _
We have a strong football pro-
gram and a strong tradition.

Unfortunately, though, we don’t com-‘

mand the television market needed to
enter a big conference like the'Big
Ten. They tap the Pittsburgh market
with Penn State.

The MAC, however, isn’t known
as much of a powerhouse conference

A —— yet. It’s on the way up, though.

They’ve defeated top 25 teams this
year. Pitt should get in on the ground

floor of this up—and-coming confer-

ence and use its muscle to transform
MAC into a conference‘ to be reck-
oned with.

Pitt needs to give up the dream of_
keeping a failing program alive. 6

Boston College bailed. Virginia Tech
bailed. Miami was going to leave
either way. The conference will never
be a football powerhouse again. The
imminent demise of the Big East isn’t
the end of collegiate sports. It’s not
even the end of football. » --
Pitt should realize this, cut its
losses, and shop around for another
conference where our football team
can ﬂourish. ‘

' /\iJi;l,l..I'l.l.T:LLYwY,

f’/

-:————u(

Iamareally shy male freshman. Ihave
very little expeﬁence with women and had
my ﬁrst kiss only over this past summer
(which I feel is very pathetic). Now that I’m
at Pitt, I want to have a girlfriend or just get
laid. Basically I want some kind of contact
with a female besides ﬁiendship. I have tons
of friends that -are girls that I have no prob-
lem meeting, but when the intent is to have
some kind of “relationship” I_ totally melt
and become a nervous wreck. I’m starting
to think there is something wrong with me

. can you give me any ’
advice?

Dear Shy:

It’s too damn bad that
you’ve been conditioned to
think having your ﬁrst kiss
after high school is pathetic.
That’s not pathetic. Don’t you
think maybe kids in high
school getting" knocked up or
diseased is a little more pathet-
ic? So you aren’t a raging
manwhore. Good for you.

Don’t feel bad about your lack of expe-
iience, but if it makes you unhappy, then
let’s ﬁgure out how to take you away from
the Land of No Nookie and into Happy
Hookup Heaven. '

You have no problem meeting women.
You’ve already busted through the ﬁrst
sticking point for most men. So, women in
your life, and the ability to meet more?
Check. Congrats.

What is it that immediately puts you

into The Friend Zone with these hordes of -

women? Having a million female friends

» could lead to trouble in the way you are per-

ceived by potential boot-knocking partners.

Do you give off gay vibes? If that’s the
problem, you can ooze heterosexuality,
even without walking around with a copy of

Hustler in your backpack. Casually mention

Fill the time between baby and adult diapers with passion

It’s good to have passion.

I’d say it’s almost necessary to have some-
thing you’re crazy about.

Otherwise, you’re not really doing something
with the complex system of neurons you’ve been
fortunate enough to evolve. The human life span
just isn’t ‘long enough for you to exist and not
make anything happen in the time
between baby diapers and adult dia-
pers.

I couldn’t live without writing.

Seeing that sentence scares me but
it’s the truth. At first I thought my
dream of being a fiction writer was
just the whim of the moment or even
something I was clinging to out of
desperation.

In my senior year of high school I
had an‘ English teacher that finally
broke through my teenage indifference
and made me care about something
outside myself. She read the papers I had to
write for her and thought that I had talent and
promise.

Unlike many high school teachers, she acted
upon her intuition and encouraged me to take an
interest in writing. At the time, I liked the praise
but I thought maybe she was a little crazy from
having such an unrewarding job. Trying to edu-
cate the unwilling can take its toll on a person.

Once in college, I thought I’d probably be a
history major, the most rocking—est major ever. I
pictured myself as appearing in specials on The

    

Seth 
Columnist

History Channel or PBS, stroking my goatee and
commenting on the ramifications of the Franco-
Prussian war of 1870-71. France got its ass
kicked and thus furthered the growing imperial-
ist/nationalist tensions between the industrial
nations of western and central Europe, if any-
one’s interested.

Then I took Introduction to
Fiction my second semester freshman
year and I realized two things. First,

History Channel Presents: The Dark
Days Beforethe Great War was not as
cool as fantasizinglabout say, having
sex with all the ladies of Destiny’s
Child at once. Second, for me, writing
fiction was more fun and important
than anything else. _

elation it was for me to realize the
immensity and beauty that ismaking
up stories. From that time forward there has
always been this driving force in the back of my
skull. Sometimes» it feels like the barrel of an
assault riﬂe and sometimes like the tender mes-
saging hands of a beautiful woman. Oh yes,
those tender messaging hands. »
I’m no fool. I know there are other things
that are important in life — the love of someone
nice, family, and helping out who you can. But if

all those things left me and I didn’t commit sui-'

cide, I’d still have writing, and I think I could
manage with that.

fantasizing about having cameos in a -

What a beautiful and painful rev _

' There are roadblocks all alongmy path. Most
significant right now is that I’m not a good’
writer. This is not self—pity; I’ll get better. You’d
think that, being so desperately in love with
writing, I’d be good in classes dedicated to it.
But I’ve never gotten an A in any of myiwriting
classes, so far. Does this discourage me? Yes, but
does it stop me? Hell, naw. .

So what does this mean to you, who has

-spent at least three minutes of your time reading

this column? Obviously, you weren’t frightened

by the picture of me above, or too turned on to -

do anything but go home and masturbate to .it.
You read my work. So, I hope you’ll see that
there are other people with powerful ambitions
like you, possibly chasing empty dreams but
doing it anyways because Wal Mart will always
be hiring. 

Maybe you’re a music major or a philosophy
major and you don’t want to starve after college.
Or perhaps you’re an engineer with a secret pas-
sion for pottery. Go for it. Something will always
work out. Crappy advice, I know, but that’s how
it is. Things probably won’t turn out exactly as
you hoped they would, but, then again, rarely
does anything — so who cares? If you take my
advice and your life is ruined, come find me.

We can always start a new age cult together.

Bush etc. wrongly scapegoatingtgays for nation’s problems

On Oct. 16, a gay couple from
Randolph, NJ, will celebrate their wed-
ding ceremony.

For many Americans, such a radical
concept is cause enough to congregate
outside the celebration in protest, but this
particular union will most likely draw an
even larger crowd of protestors.

The reason? This couple has planned
their union during Marriage Protection
Week. From Oct. 12 — 18, people from
around the country will be protesting this
same-sex union as part of a national cam-
paign-

Last week, President George W. Bush
declared this week Marriage Protection
Week. In his Oct. 3 address, the president
called on all Americans to join him “in
expressing support for the institution of
marriage with all its beneﬁts to our peo-
ple, our culture and our society.” This
seems to be a rather indiscriminate carn-
paign, until he went on to deﬁne maniage
as “a union between a man and a
woman.”

The designation of this national week
has sparked diligent debate between gay
and lesbian rights activists and conserva-
tive groups such as the American Family
Association.

The Family Association has devel-

n..-

building block of the family

oped a Marriage Protection Week Web
site that propagates the idea that legalized
same-sex marriages are a threat to what
they describe as the sacred institution of
marriage between a man and a woman.
Donald E. Wrldmon, chairman of the
American Family Association, writes that
the union ofaman anda -
woman is “the God-ordained

and bedrock of a civil soci-
ety.”

This same site offers
some ill-reasoned arguments
implying that gay marriage
may encourage America’s
children to become gay; will
increase the spread of AIDS;
and will increase social

the lack of civility in our society on homo-

Rather than expend such energy in a

all. Much of the violence
among children and
teenagers today stems from

problems such as premarital .

poverty and school failure or expulsion.
If this isn’t a bunch of malarkey, I
don’t know what is.
This list describes issues that are

prevalent among America’s youth that,

While about 55 percent of the popu-
lation opposes gay marriages, according
to a CBS News poll, younger Americans
are more likely to be accepting of laws
that permit it. The same poll showed that
61 percent of 18 to 29 year olds favor it.

It seems the older generation in

America is a little behind the times in their

opposition. For example, Vermont has

Canada is moving toward the national
acknowledgement of gay marriage, the
Episcopal Church has ordained an openly

and in the Netherlands gay marriage has

been legal since December, 2000.

According to a Washington Post arti- '

cle, gay marriage in the Netherlands has
become so accepted that about 8 percent
of marriages there are between gay cou-
ples, '

Helene Faasen of the Netherlands‘ '
said on datalounge.com that gay marriage _

doesn’t destroy families, it increases the
number of families. In a nation such as the
U.S. ‘in which one-parent households are
becoming more common every day, the
idea of limiting marriage rights in any
way contributes to the problem rather than
offering a solution to it.

So whether the gay couple in New
Jersey is trying to make a political state-

ment in opposition to Marriage Protection 1

Week, one thing is certain: They are cele-
brating and professing their love in a
binding commitment to each other. In my
mind, they are upholdingthe sanctity of
marriage as it beneﬁts "all people in a civil

Midnight in the garden of suburbia

Everything in the Garden
Wed.-Sun. through Oct. 9
Directed by Jeffrey M. Cordell
University of Pittsburgh
Repertory Theatre

trike‘:

PATRICIA MCNEILL
Staff Writer

“Everything in the Garden” by Edward
Albee (“Who’s Afraid ofV1rginia Woolf?”)
is a dark comedy about suburbia. Set in the
1960s, the play explores the lengths people
will go to get what they want and keep what
they have. _

The play is set in the modest living
room and ﬂourishing garden of Jenny
(Diane Mazeppa), a typical suburban
housewife, and her husband Richard
(Devin Malcolm), a research chemist. As
the play opens, the audience is quickly
drawn into their relationship as Jenny
berates Richard for not saving coupons
from the cigarette packs, especially since
they only smoke the cigarettes to get the
coupons.

Money is tight in their household, as
they struggle to maintain appearances and
keep up with the lavish lifestyles of their
friends, who are buying second cars and
drinking expensive liquor. Meanwhile,
Richard wants an electric mower and Jenny

longs for a greenhouse, priding herself on
her well—tended garden and green thumb.

I Mazeppa and Malcolm work extreme-
ly well together. They easily transition from
heated discussion to playful bantering with
a nice blend of wit and humor. One
moment Richard is adamantly refusing to
allow Jenny to work part time and the-next
he’s a T ransylvanian vampire trying to get a
kiss. They are painfully reminded of being
poor, or “not having money” as Jenny cor-
rects, with the arrival of their friend Jack
(Benjamin Blazer), a millionaire with a
smooth charm and a ﬂame for Jenny.
Blazer gives an excellent performance,
combining just the right amount of noncha—
lance and playboy wit. Commentating on
the lives of Jenny and Richard, he often
speaks directly to the audience, pulling us
even deeper into their world.

When Richard runs out to buy some
liquor, slightly reluctant to leave Jenny with
Jack, they receive a visit from a stranger, a
woman named Mrs. Tooth. As Jacktakes
his leave, Mrs. Tooth, a British business-
woman, explains that she has come to offer
Jenny a job. Giving her an advance salary
of $1,000, Jenny wonders what kind of
employment she could be offering. When

she realizes exactly how she’d be pleasing”

the clientele, she throws Mrs. Tooth out of
her house and rips up her card. Unable to
throw the money away, Jenny is seduced by
the idea of ﬁnancial security, suggesting to
Richard that they go out for an expensive
dinner. After using some of the thousand
dollars, Jenny carefully retrieves Mrs.

'/er ’/ff/fr. ‘s. '1'/'«.’I:

'21 PH xx-..;-H /ml; /62./I

Tooth’s card from the garbage can. The
play continues as the impact of Jenny’s
decision affects. her life and marriage.
Diana Mazeppa is superb in the role of
Jenny. Strong characterization allows
Mazeppa to take her character from youth-
ful excitement over the possibility of a
greenhouse and a garden party to a fright-
ening coldness as she justiﬁes her actions
and decisions. Malco1rn’s portrayal of
Richard is emotionally charged.- VV1th black
ﬂamed glasses and a checkered shirt, he
gives the appearance of a mild-mannered
geek, but when pushed he explodes with
surprising emotional intensity. But while
they contrast each other nicely, Jenny’s
calmness in the face of Richard’s anger at

times brings down the emotional intensity
rather than heightening it. Particularly anti-
clirnactic is Richard’s striking of Jenny.

Director Jeffery M. Cordell does a nice
job of bringing the dark humor of Albee’s
script to life. The lighting design, by
Michael Homchosky, nicely accents the
performance. Also notable is the ensemble
performance given by Jenny and Richard’s
country club friends. They successfully cre-
ated an elitist community that smiled to
your face and gossiped behind your back.

“When gardens are let go, you know
there’s something wrong in the house,”
Jenny tells Richard. But this production
illustrates that the most beautiful and deli-
cate ﬂowers may have rotting roots.

nursing home. Is there any truth to that?

What do you mean “used to?” Have you seen
the people whoilive in Lothrop? Because I lived
there freshman year and damn, man. ~ 

The part about Forbes is definitely true. Afte
a small battle for Forbes Pavilion, which was the

-name of the nursing home at 3517-21 Forbes Ave.

(I guess nursinglhomes get lots of addresses), Pitt
got Pittsburgh City‘ Council to pass a 7-1 bill
allowing the University to house 256‘students in
the complex. ‘Pitt bought the Pavilion with a loan
fromthe U.S. Department ;_of..Housing and Urban
Development for — any guesses? —-— $1.7 million.

For the record, $1.7 millioniwas the average
salary of a major league baseball player on open-
irig day in 1999. A dollar doesn’t go quite as far- as
it used to, it appears. _ ',

The new dorm — sorry, residence hall. — was

dedicated on October 20, 1978, with speeches by 1

then-Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar and then-
Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri. There is no
mention in the Pitt archives of whether or not
Posvar referenced the fact that the mayor’s name
sounded like a pasta.

As for the ‘Throp, as we affectionately

, deemed that monstrosity of a living" space, the

only insane peopleit ever housed were ones that
had not been committed.

I It ‘began as a residence for nursing "students —
not to be confused with a “nursing home.” Ground
was broken in a ceremony held October 12, 1950.
The Honorable David L. Lawrence, after whom
our Lawrence Hall is named, spoke about the sig-
nificance of 190 Lothrop St. and what the Nursing
School meant to the City of Pittsburgh.

While I don’t have a copy of his speech, Pitt
Magazine reported on May 11, 1953, on the
anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s death, the
Nursing School had ceremonies dedicating the

- building. Included in that ceremony was Clifford

Heinz, “a loyal and devoted friend of the

University,” presenting a brick from N ightingale’s
old house. Yes, that’s right, Heinz liked Flo so
much that he took a brick from her house and
rededicated a room in Pitt’s shining new facility to
the mother of nursing. ’‘

Anyway, after he handed the masonry off to
the University, nursing students lived and worked
in the l6—story complex for many years, all with
relatively normal levels of insanity. And no,
before you ask, it’s not haunted. Unless you count
really creepy guys who aren’t allthere all the
time, in which case it’s very haunted.

Stupid Questions was delayed for a while thanks
to silly dining guides and such. Ifyou have a ques-
tion that you’re afraid to ask, just remember what
Chris Berman said: “There ’s no such thing as stu-
pid questions, there’s only stupid people who ask
questions.” Then e-mail your question about Pitt,

Talk: “Everything in the Garden” director Jeffrey M. Cordell

INTERVIEWED BY
PATRICIA MCNEILL

Jeffrey M. Cordell, a Theatre Arts
M.A./Ph.D. student, is, the director
of Pitt Repertory J-Theatre’s season
opener, “Everything in the Garden”
by Edward Albee, which is currently
being performed in‘ the Henry
Heymann Theater.

Why did you choose this show?
Have you worked with scripts by
Edward Albee in the past? ‘

In college, I, fell in love with
Albe”e’s‘ .""A"‘Delicat‘e‘ Balance” ‘ and
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”

and I had the chance to see the:
soon

Public Theatre’s “Woolf?”
after.-.my.., .firs_t.. readings, and I ‘p fell
deeper. But, truth be said, most of

his 'full—length'plays are not pieces’
that can be performed by undergrad- ,

uate actors, and that has nothingto

do with"inte-lligence_-for tal.en't,.I.I .-

think that-comrnent has more to do
with" the fact-that A1bee’s plays. are

Vi:ry.:.a91111t.aI1.€1..,adﬂ1t in .6634, .aI;;gry..:.
‘wry k,ind',ofiway"that,"even at -26, I 5?

don’t feel’ comfortable‘? saying I
know much aboutas a director. So, I
went searching for an Albee pl_ay
that my-~undergraduat'e team’ would

’ have a’ great, challenging success

with as students of _ theatre. This
play fit the bill because it wasufast,
funny,» frightening and quite accessi-
ble for my actors and designers.

Can you tell me a little bit about

your casting choices? Specifically,
what were you looking for in the
characters of Jenny, Richard and
Jack? - A

These are the descriptionsl posted
before auditions [in the last week of
August] for actors to review and
prepare for —— I feel like Diane
Mazeppa [Jenny], Devin ~Malcolm

[Richard] and Benjamin Blazer

[Jack]» really fit these descriptions
beautifully:

Richard and Jenny: Our protagonist
couple —-— coupon-saving, money-
frantic’, yet quick—witted pair_ of sub-
urban dreamers. He’s a chemist and
she’s' a housewife with a green
thumb. "Both want to keep up with
the Joneses, debt be damned!
They”-re ‘attractive but superficial,

cuddly and sharp at the edges.

Richard ﬂies into impotent furies
while Jenny is capable of cool, col-
lected defiance._ Both, however,
seem to be currently gambling with
their moral core. On the surface,

fjtheyffre afbit like married Chandler

and Monica from “Friends.”

Jack: The neighborhood millionaire
bachelor (we all have, one of those,

i.don’t- we?) who has great taste,

impeccable timing, a quick wit, the
-gift of gab and a philanthropic spir-
it. Speaking of spirits, he is fre-
quently drunk, or chatting it up with
the boys at the club, or painting por-

‘traits of wealthy local wives. He has

a soft spot for Richard and Jenny

(Jenny in particular) and perhaps
that’s mainly why‘he’s always stop-

ping by unannounced. Jack occa-

sionally speaks to the audience
directly. He is the provocative out-
sider who seems to have everything
everybody else wants. Think of the
subject of Carly Simon’s “You’re So
Vain” or, perhaps, of Hugh Grant.

Can’ you say anything about the
setting choices and lighting choic-
es for the production?

I also wanted the play to feel slight- '

ly cinematic and also reminiscent of
a situation comedy on TV, but I
never wanted to disguise ‘that this
production is pure, entertaining the-
atre. Mike‘ Homchosky’s lights have

really shaped strong beginning and

ending mornentsfor the show — and

a good story, play or filmaneeds a-

clear and attractive start andy_co‘nclu-
sion —-— which 'is‘one reason we’ve
lit the garden and the house sepa-

rately, and "why ‘there are very

“filmic” lights-up and blackout
moments in this show. Jeff Cebiula’s

set has been so much fun to play on. I

He provided me with a very ,3-D and
modern ‘60s suburban _,living room
and then placed this outlandishly
vivid, superficial and plastic garden
just a few feet beyond. Iilove that
contrast. « ’ - 

What theme, ‘message or idea did
you really try to convey to the
audience when you were making
your directing choices?

Mainly, I wanted the audience to get I

caught up in the story of Richard
and Jenny. It’s a pretty exciting
story, I think. For me, directing, act-

ing, design —— they’re all ways of
storytelling and if you can make
choices to keep the audience

engaged and asking questions about
where the story you’re telling is

iheaded, I think you’ve provided

both pleasurable entertainment and
a chance to teach others through sto-
rytelling.

What about this production still
resonates today? Could this show
be taken out of its time period and
performed in--today’s society? ’

Absolutely. In fact, I toyed with the
idea of ‘updating it for quite a while
in the planning phases. I don’t think
that sex, _money, greed, prejudice
and “keeping up appearances” ,».are
components of human life that will
drop out of critical conversation

‘ anytime. s_oon.,What I find.-most sub-

versive is the fact that we‘ laugh‘ at

the racist and anti—Semitic couples

who vlive-'1 in this”American suburb.
and -we laugh atieveryone’s petty
fears -about money Albee asks
that we do —-— and all the time we’re
thinking that 'we,jdo“n"t do such
things. Then",-the nextday, ‘or a week
or two later, you see someone
caught in the same situation, making
the same joke, and you are suddenly
skeptical of the present, asking,
“Have times really changed?-”

Singer-songwriter Keller \V1lliams
will bring his contemporary mishmash
of acoustic jam music to Metropol on
Wednesday’ evening.

But don’t be fooled by that drab,
narrow label; \V11liams is no coffee-shop
hipster, plucking quiet ballads to a :
sedate crowd of java—sipping admirers.
He is the hippy, toga-clad John Belushi
of a modem—day “Animal House,”
impulsively ripping the guitar out of the
hands of that sorry archetype and
smashing it, along with all preconceived
notions about the genre, to pieces
against the wall. ‘

Over the course of eight albums and
years of relentless touring, \V1lliams has
pushed the boundaries of acoustic music
with his innovative approach to creation
and performance. At his aid: a sophisti—_
cated array of guitar effect pedals and a
variety of stringed instruments. The
technology allows him to “loop” his
guitar parts so that they repeat. Williams
will often switch guitars and loop more
than one guitar part on stage, creating an
intricate network of sounds with which
to accompany himself before ﬁnally
playing along.

But Williams’ show is not all smoke
and mirrors. His bright, percussive gui-

tar style, combining elements of finger-

equally as impressive as his technologi-

A newly-crowned heavyweight in

Magazine in 2002 — Wﬂliarns has
played such prestigious festivals as

intimate venues, like a legendary perfor-

But whether he’s in front of 50 peo-
ple or 50,000 people, Williams’ shows
are always  examples of the cap-
tivating potential of solo performance.
Expect a lesson in musical appreciation,

_ as he digs into a catalogue of cover

songs deep enough for a Bar Mitzvah
band; as well as his owndiverse musical

Viewty comes to the GameCube

Viewtiful Joe e

Developed by Team Viewtiful
Published by Capcom
Nintendo GameCube.
7i‘n‘r<.“r1/2

One year ago, Capcom armounced

five new games to be developed for the, T

GameCube. In that year, one has been
disavowed, one sucked terribly, two
haven’t been heard from and one hitthe
gaming scene like a pink tidal wave.
“Viewtiful Joe,” #2 of the “Fantastic
Five”, has just raised the bar for 2-D plat-
formers by a mile and a half. I haven’t
seena more revolutionary ‘entry in the
genre since “Super Mario" Bros. 3.”

As Joe, a poor soul who cares more
about classic movies than the advances
of his girlfriend, you start out on a date
with your best gal, only to watch her be
abducted by the villainthat jumps out of
the screen, grabbing her and making off
into the world of celluloid. Your task is to
rescue her by becoming the greatest,
smoothest — and certainly not last —
action hero, Viewtiful J oe.

“Viewtiful” certainly sounds like
“beautiful,” a word that ﬁts this game
like spandex. Richly detailed back-
grounds display fantastic parallax effects;

the cell-shaded characters are bright and ,

lively and the entire work goes down as

smooth as over-greased theater popcorn. .
‘It ' took a concerted effort, though, to

notice the music. Sure, it was there, but
there’s no time. to enjoy frivolous things
like music in the heat of gameplay.

Oh, the gameplay. This game would
be decent if it was just a matter of punch-
ing and kicking, but Joe’s superpowers
make for a unique experience. You can
blitz through a line of enemies with the
Mach Speed effect, zoom the camera in
and pull off incredible jumping strikes,
then slow time to bullet-dodging speed
and even deﬂect gunﬁre back at your
opponent with your ﬁsts.

The " only —— and I mean only —
potential problem is this game’s difficul-
ty. “Viewtiful Joe” is a hard game, in the

same vein as “Contra” and “Shinobi.”

The controls take a while to learn, the
techniques take a while to master and
each boss is a graduate-level study in pat-
tern recognition. However, with a little
perseverance, getting past. the learning
curve shouldn’t take too long.

“Viewtiful Joe” is the new standard
for platform games. It takes the rariﬁed
2-D style, combines it with today’s
graphical ﬂair, then throws in some old
school challenge and effects straight
from “The Matrix” to create one of this
year’s greatest games. Just don’t over-
look your signiﬁcant other to make time
for the game —— we’ve seen how many
problems can arise from that. .

Off the wire: Keller Williams bucks trends, kills guitar

PATRICK STUTZ ,
Badger Herald _(U.Wisconsin)

(U -WIRE) MADISON, Wis. — Call
him folk, call him bluegrass, but don’t
call him ordinary. Packing a legion of
guitars and electrical equipment,
Keller Williams recently kicked off
his fall tour to promote the release of
his new album, Home.

Critics nationwide have pondered
the labels that can be placed on
Williams, for his music crosses so
many boundaries that there truly is no
classiﬁcation.

Still, in a recent phone interview
with The Badger Herald, Williams
paused and drew in a deep breath
before describing his music as “solo—
acoustic-jazz—funk-reggae—techno—
grass.”

But not since Jesse “The Lone
Cat” Fuller at the 1959 Monterey Jazz
Festival has there been a solo artist
that has sparked as much attention as
Williams has. Utilizing electrical loop-
ing and a customized l0—string guitar,
he creates on stage a virtual sympho-
ny of rhythms and sounds that would
normally take a full band to produce.

By building layer upon layer of
riffs and medleys, Williams is able to
provide himself a bass line and
rhythm section with which to play

concertgoers by looping his own voice

Destroying all stereotypes about
one—man bands and solo artists, Keller
Williams has brought forth a musical
show that has been embraced by the
growing jam—band scene and has cre-
ated a following of his own.

“I like seeing a lot of the same
people over and over,” he said. “I call
them repeat offenders.”

But Williams has more reasons
than fan base to be happy. Home
marks his eighth album release, and,
despite past collaborations with The
String Cheese Incident on Breathe and
Dave Watts and Tye North’s work on
Laugh, Williams decided to ﬂy solo
this time around. . ‘

“I have been traveling and per-
forming solo for so long,” he said,
“That it seemed like that obvious thing
to do. I wanted to bring what I do on
the stage into the studio. They have
always been two separate monsters for
me.” »

However, if conquering a beast of
a project was his plan, then that’s just
what he got. On Home, Williams took
on the task of playing all the instru-
ments himself.

But he may sell himself short on T
his interpretation of Home. What’

Williams has created is a, studio inter-
pretation of his live shows, and even
withoutexternal talent, he created a
solid album that still sounds uniquely
his own. I . V

Williams’ true wizardry, however,
is not his ability to create great albums
or write quirky lyrics that mirror his
real—life adventures. The brilliance that
has carried him nationwide is attrib-
uted to his incredible guitar playing,
which is often compared to Leo

is a musician who borders on genius.

lous show. ‘ ’

“I think the people of Madison

“They might also see some young, ‘

open-minded, hairy people and a lot of
smiles.”

Notre Dame running back Julius Jones (carrying the football) bursts through the Pitt defense on the way to a 49-yard touchdown run during the Fighting Irish’s 20-

14 win over the Panthers on Saturday. Jones set a school single-game record, rushing for 262 yards in the Notre Dame win.

Fighting Irish run   over  

JOE MARCHILENA
4 Sports Editor

, The fifth-largest crowd in Pitt
football history got to see a perfor-
mance worthy of the Heisman Trophy
on Saturday, but it - was not Larry
Fitzgerald or Rod Rutherford who‘ put
on the show. 5

It was Julius Jones. . t

The crowd of 66,421 watched the
Notre Dame running back rush for a
school-record 262" yards and two
touchdowns’ -on 24 carries, as the
Fighting Irish (2-3) upset then-No. 15
Pitt (3-2), 20-14. '

Jones averaged 10.9 yards per
carry —— including runs‘ of 25, 39, 49
and 61 yards —— and became the first
Notre Dame running back to rush for
over 200 yards in a game since
Reggie Brooks did it twice in 1992.

“It was hard to get -your" arms
around him, he’s an incredible ath-
lete,” defensive tackle Vince
Crochunis said of Jones. “We expect-
ed" them to pass the ball more, but
when something is working as wellas

it was, why change? That was smart-

play"cal1ing.” . 7 Q

As a’ team, the Irish‘ ran for 352
yards, including 49 yards on the final
drive of the game. V

With 9:41 left in the fourth quar-
ter, Notre Dame took over on its.own

'12 yard line. The combination of

Jones and running back Ryan Grant
— who had 84 yards on 27 carries -
was too much for the Panthers, as the
Irish were able to put‘ together a 16-
play drive and Pitt never saw the ball
again. I A

Pitt’s defense had a chance to get
off the field as the Irish faced third-

 

and-'11 with less than three minutes to
play. But freshman quarterback Brady
Quinn, making just his second start,
found wide receiver ‘Omar Jenkins
along the sidelines for a 19 yard gain‘.
The- completion wasthe only one of
the fourth quarter for Quinn, who was
just five—of-17 passing for 33 yards.
“We just had to get the first
down,” Quinn said. “I wasn’t really
sure if we were going to be able to fit
it -- in because of the way the
-[corner]back got around in the ﬂat

‘ and sat underneath it. [Jenkins] had to

come up with a great catch and stay in
bounds and it really helped us as far
as getting that drive to solidify the
win.” . _

The Pantherswere unable to stop
the clock after that, having used all
their timeouts in the third quarter.

' “A couple of times the play got in

anthér-S,fbeatPitt 20-14

late and I’ll take credit for that,” Pitt
head coach Walt Harris said. “It’s dif-
ficult to call plays when you’re not
sure which ones are going to work.”
While Notre Dame was trampling

over the Panthers’ defense, Pitt had a’

hard time moving the ball on offense,
gaining just 175 total yards, including
just eight yards rushing. In their first
four. games, the Panthers had aver-
aged 38.2 points and 465.5 yards on
offense per game.

Pitt also could not keep the Irish
pass rush, off of Rutherford all day.
Notre Dame’s defense recorded eight
sacks, including 3 1/2 by defensive
end Justin Tuck.

Rutherford finished the game 12-
of-30 for 167 yards and two touch-
downs. Fitzgerald extending his scor-

SPOR 

  

The setting was perfect. The

air was cool, the sky was clear"

and, as the Panthers kicked off to
the Fighting Irish, it looked as
though it was going to be a great
night for Pitt football.

Looks can be deceiving.

After forcing the Notre Dame
offense to go three-and-out on its
first possession, it looked_like the
defense might have a strong per-
formance. But after William
Ferguson’s fumbled fair catch
attempt, the Notre Dame offense
was back in business as they took

‘over on Pitt’s 34-yard line, set-

ting up a 25-yard Julius Jones
touchdown run. *

I That long touchdown run was
only the beginning of what ended
up a record setting night for

Jones. Jones racked up 262 yards.

on the ground, 106 of those yards
coming in the fourth quarter.

So why was Jones able to find
so much success against the
Panthers’ defense?

You could start by pointing

“out the fact that the Panthers did

not tackle particularly,‘ well, or
even. the fact that Notre Dame
head coach Tyrone Willingham
ditched the west coast offense
and played a physical, smash-
mouth style, of football against
the Panthers.

While these are both valid
arguments, I believe that Pitt’s
lack of offensive production was
a key factor in the defensive
meltdown. \

The Panthers simply could
not get anything done offensive-
ly, especially in the second half.

Pitt only managed to pick up 73 -

yards of total offense in the sec-
ond half and maintained posses-
sion of the ball for only nine min-
utes and 20 seconds.

Pitt’s offense hung its
defense out to dry.

BC decides to leaveBig East

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

And then there were five.‘ .

In a move that has been rumored to
happen. for some time, Boston College
has accepted an invitation to join the
Atlantic Coast Conference, giving the
ACC enough teams to stage a lucrative
league championship football game.

‘ The move, which Boston College’s
president said was done to improve ath-
letics, academics and finances and
should be complete by 2005, will reduce

the Big Eastto just five football-playing »

schools. _

,“The ACC is a strong, stable confer-
ence,” The Rev. William Leahy said,
according to espn.com. “The move to the
ACC will generate greater revenues in
the future.” ’ A _

The school will pay an exit fee to
leave the conference, but wasn’t sure
how much it would be, Leahy continued‘.

“We were notified today by Fr.
Leahy of Boston College and [commis-
sioner] John Swofford of the ACC that
Boston College has accepted an‘invita-
tion to join ‘the Atlantic Coast
Conference,” Big Easticommissioner
Michael A. Tranghese said in a state-
ment. “We are extremely disappointed
with Boston College’s decision to leave.
Our membership is very,surprised that
the ACC presidents continue to come
back into our league for membership.”

Pitt Athletics Director Jeff _ Long
released a statement late Sunday night.

“We. 2 are disappointed with the
ACC’s continued attack on the Big East
conference and in Boston College’s deci-
sion to turn its back on its fellow mem-
bers of the Big East,” Long said. “This is
especially disappointing given the fact

that Boston College had re-pledged its

loyalty to the conference just a short

_ time ago.
“Given this pledge, and the very »

public and very embarrassing rejection
they received earlier from the-ACC, it is
somewhat surprising they‘ have decided
to depart,” Long continued.

Originally part of the ACCis expan- ,

sion plan, Boston College joins Miami
and Virginia Tech in the conference

switch, giving the ACC the 12 teams it..

needs-‘to host a championship football
game. i -

NCAA rules require a conference to
have 12 members toihost a championship
game. The Mid-Atlantic Conference, the
Big 12 and the Southeastern Conference
are the only other football conferences
that host championship games.

Syracuse was included along with
Boston College and Miami in the ACC’s
original expansion plans, but the confer-

ence decided to add the Hokies instead. -

Once the expansion is complete, only

Swimming and diving sets records at annual Blue—Goldmeet

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

The Pitt swimming and diving teams kicked
off the 2003-04 season in grand style Friday
afternoon by breaking~19 meet records at the
annual Blue—Gold intrasquad meet.

Head coach Chuck Knoles was very pleased
with his team’s performance, and is looking for-
ward to this year’s campaign. p

“[There were] too many good performances
to mention,” Knoles said. “[It’s] probably the
deepest men’s team we’ve ever had and definite-
ly the deepest women’s team in 15 years.”

Led by senior co-captain Jenny Livingstone’s
record-setting performance in’ the 50-yard
freestyle, the women’s Gold team narrowly
defeated the women’s Blue team "130-125 at
Trees pool. Livingstone swam the 50-yard
freestyle in 24.23 seconds to set the new meet

' record. .

Also capturing victories for the women’s
Gold team were senior Ryan Redman in the 100-
yard breaststroke, sophomore Amy Miteff in the
200-yard butterﬂy, senior Kelli Tielking in the
100-yard butterﬂy and junior Jennifer Kochin
the 200-yard individual medley. The women’s
Gold team set meet records in the 200-yard med-
ley relay with a time of 1:45.42, and in the 200-
yard freestyle relay with a time of 1:38.09.

, For the- women’s Blue team, senior co-cap-

' tain Carolyne Savini won the 100-yard freestyle

and the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke, set-
ting meet records in the 100-yard freestyle with
a time of 52.20 seconds and in the 100-yard
backstroke with a time of 57.54.

“[Savini] is a phenomenal athlete and team
leader,” Knoles said. “She’s the prescription for
a team captain.”

Additionally, junior Cynthia Snyder set a
meet record for the women’s Blue team with her
time of 2:24.21 in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Kate Butrie recorded a victory for the women’s
Blue. team in the_500-yard freestyle as well.

Also, the women’s Blue team received a
strong performance from freshman Kathy Siuda,
as she set a meet record with her time of 1:55.18
in the 200-yard freestyle.

, Freshman Marie Houghton captured the lone
diving event of the afternoon for the women’s
Blue team. with her score of 147.4 points on the
1-meter board.

“[The freshmen women] are a boatload of
talented girls,” Knoles added. » /

Meanwhile, senior Eric Limkemann captured
victories in the 200-yard freestyle, 500-yard
freestyle and 200-yard individual medley, setting
a record in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of
1:40.91, as he paced the men’s Gold team to
140-122 win over the men’s Blue team.

“You can’t do much better than that,” Kno1es_

‘said. “‘He’s going to go out in a blaze of glory.”

Also setting new meet records for the men’s
Gold team were sophomore Jason Miller and

senior Randy Gertenbach. Miller set records in
the 200-yard butterﬂy and 100-yard butterﬂy
with times of 1:52.99 and 50.41, respectively,
Gertenbach set a record in the 100-yard breast-
stroke with a time of 57.82 seconds in addition
to his victory in the 200-yard breaststroke.

“What a fireball,” Knoles said
Gertenbach. “It must be that red hair.”

Freshman Jeff Leath took home a win for the
men’s Gold team as well, winning the 200-yard
backstroke. Additionally, the men’s Gold team
set a record in the 200-yard medley relay with a
time of 1:33.57.

For the men’s Blue team, Eric Bugby and
Tommy Bird set records in the 100-yard back-
stroke and .50-yard freestyle, respectively.
Bugby finished the 100-yard backstroke in 50.51
while Bird completed the 50-yard freestyle in
20.96. Also recording__a win for the men’s Blue
team was Adam Webber in the 100-yard
freestyle. The men’s Blue team set a new record
in the 200-yard freestyle relay as well with a
time of 1:23.43.

Sophomore Troy Kaczorowski scored 185.45
points on the 1-meter board for the men’s Blue
team as well.

While Knoles is looking forward to the new
season, he is confident that his team understands
what is expected of them..

of

“[It’s] tough to be a member of the swim- 4

ming and diving teams when the previous year’s
teams keep ‘raising the bar,” Knoles said.

ing streak to 11 games, catching five
passes for 79 yards and two scores, all
of which came in the first half.

Like ‘its previous two games
against the Irish, turnovers hurt Pitt,
as Notre Dame was able to score 10
points off of the Panthers’ mistakes.

After the defense stopped the
Irish on their opening drive, William
Ferguson fumbled the punt and Bobby

. Renkes fell on the loose ball at the

Pitt 34-yard line.

On third-and—one, Jones ran"
around the right side of the line and, 
after breaking one tackle, ran—25 yards

untouched to the corner of the end
zone. Nicholas Setta added the extra
point to give the Irish a 7-0 lead with
12:08 to play in the first quarter.

The Panthers were unable to do
anything on their first three posses-
sions. Pitt lost a totalof 23 yards as

Rutherford was sacked once on each_

drive and the Pantherswere forced to
punt each time. . . '
After two incompletions on the
next possession, Rutherford scram-
bled out of the pocket and found
Fitzgerald in the middle of the field
for 15 yards and a_ ﬁrst down at the

Notre Dame 37. Three plays later,
Rutherford connected with Fitzgerald
again in the left corner of the end

zone for a 23-yard touchdown. David

Abdul kicked the extra point to tie the
score at seven. , '
Notre Dame was forced to punt on
its next possession. Ferguson received
the kick at Pitt’s 25 and, after getting
key blocks from Shawntae Spencer,

‘H.B. Blades and Josh Lay, returnedit

71 yards to the Notre Dame 2-yard
line. ‘ . ’ »

Two plays later, Rutherford found
Fitzgerald, who madethe catch over
cornerback Vontez Duff, for the
touchdown. Abdul kicked the extra

' point and Pitt lead 14-7. ‘

But Pitt was unable to hold onto

the lead as its running game stalled.
Making his second start in place of
injured running back Brandon Miree,
Jawan Walker led Pitt with 37 yards
on 10 carries.
, “You cannot run the football.like
we couldn’t,” Harris said. “This” is a
game that we had‘ trouble physically
getting it done.” ” 

With 10:17 to go in the second
quarter, Notre Dame started from its
own 30. After Grant ran three times
for 21 yards, the Irish faced third-and-

one from the Pitt 49.

The Pitt defense lined up close to
the ball in ‘order to stop the run, but
Jones was able to find a hole, running
49 yards for the touchdown, .

“When you get big plays like- that
in a ball game and it does two things,”
Notre Dame offensive coordinator
Bill Diedrick said. “I think emotional-
ly, it helps you tremendously, and def-
initely it keeps you on the field mov-
ing the ball. I think it has a lot of pos-
itive benefits and most of them are
emotional, too.”

Pitt had ‘opportunities to stay in

the game, but the Panthers were
unable to capitalize on them.

Abdul missed two field goals, one
from 38 yards in the second quarter
that would have given Pitt a 17-14
lead and the other coming after a
Spencer interception in the third quar-
ter that would have tied the game at
17.

“The difference between winning
and losing is very, very slight,” Harris
said. “Sometimes we should have [run
the ball] when we threw, and we
dropped passes. For some reason we
weren’t as sharp as we’ve‘been.”

NotreDame defense shuts down
Panthers’ running and passing game

Walker, page 16

Notre Dame played mostly cover
two defense in the second half,
which is not surprising considering
the big-play capability of wide out
Larry Fitzgerald. What is surprising
is that the Panthers were not able to
run the ball against the cover two.

For the second consecutive
game, Jawan Walker filled in for
Brandon Miree, whose injuries seem
to be worse than originally diag-

sure up the middle. Pitt’s defense
still needs to step up, but the lack of
offensive production would have
made it tough for any defense to be

successful.

The “Panthers were physically
outplayed on both sides of the ball.
As they get set to open up their Big
East Conference schedule this week-
end, they need to regroup and come
out strong, or it could be a long sea-
son.

up five yards in the second half, and

aside from that long 31-yard run in
the second quarter,'was held in
check all night.

Walker was not the only member
of the Pitt offense shut down by
Notre Dame in the second half.
Fitzgerald did not make a single
reception in the second half, mostly
because of Notre Dame’s ability to
pressure Rod Rutherford while stay-
ing in the cover two. .

Since Pitt could not move the
ball on offense that meant that the
defense was forced to stay on the
field much longer. than it should
have.

Notre Dame ran 22 plays in the
fourth quarter, 20 of which were
runs that combined for 138 yards.
This leads me to wonder why Pitt did
not line up with eight or even nine
guys in the box and make Notre
Dame beat them with the passing
game. At that point the Irish had
already proved that they were capa-
ble of moving the ball on the ground.

Pitt’s defense was able to stop
Brady Quinn from getting anything
done through the air, holding the
freshman quarterback to just 33
yards passing. However, the
Panthers failed to capitalize on two
crucial Quinn mistakes that could
have altered the outcome of the
game.

First, in the second quarter, line-
backer Malcolm Postell dropped
what could have been a game chang-
ing interception. If Postell had held
on to the ball, ‘he would have had
plenty of room to run and probably
would have scored. Then, on Notre
Dame’s first possession of the sec-
ond half, Shawntae Spencer- inter-
cepted a pass only to watch the
offense squander the opportunity, as
David Abdul missed a 48-yard field
goal '

The bottom line is that "the

Panthers could not run the ball

against Notre Dame’s cover—two
defense. That allowed the Irish to
shut down the Panther’s passing
game by playing tight coverage on
the outside and getting good pres-
