A lighting plays from Pitt’s win against Notre

Dame last year to the crowd that had taken

over the Cathedral of Learning lawn.
While Pitt’s football coach Walt Harris

came up on stage with the team, a light rain

began. A
“The best way for you to help our team

win is to scream your butts 0 ,” said
Harris. “So let’s beat Penn State!”
As Harris introduced Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg both rain and spirit intensiﬁed
in anticipation of the lighting of the bonﬁre.
“I hear that other school doesn’t want

, to play us next year,” Nordenberg said.
' “But I bet by about 6:30 [after the game],

they’ll be calling [us] for a rematc .”

As Nordenberg closed his remarks, a
bottle rocket zipped across a cable from
above the crowd to the pile of pallets
below. Apparently because of wet condi-
tions, there was a brief delay before the pal-
lets were engulfed in ﬂame. However,
pyrotechnicians quickly remedied the
problem, and the immense pile of wood
was soon blazing. '

As the ﬁre grew, workers hosed down
nearby trees, and a ﬁeld full of students
chanting “Penn State sucks”was drenched
in a torrential downpour. _ A

Though a few students left early, the
majority‘ endured the storm. Across the
Cathedral lawn, masses of fans stood
around the bonﬁre in a quickly deepening
puddle of water, yelling their hearts out in
support of the Panthers. The image could
almost be thought to foreshadow the inten-
sity and excitement to be found at
Saturday’s game at Three Rivers Stadium.

“We were going to go to.Eddies’ for

Albrecht said. I ‘

After dinner, the girls boarded the

buses with the team again and headed for
the Waterworks Movie Theatre to watch

- “Ihe Cell.” The players wore matching

1 windbreaker suits. The girls wore long-
sleeved “Team Panther” shirts. The movie
relaxed them, keeping their minds off the
game. . ' I ' .

‘The movie left a lot to be desired but

the players’ interest was in Jennifer Lopez,”-

The movie ended, and theplayers were
tired. On the ride back to the hotel, the bus

and Albrecht were on Kansky’s cell phone,
ﬁnding a ride back to the Pitt dorms to get
clothes and toiletries for game day.

“As soon as Harris found out we were
trying to get ‘ a ride back to campus, he
whipped out his cell phone and started mak-

ing all these calls to get us a ride,” Albrecht

shaking out loose muscles and bouncing
around with anticipation. ' r V

“It was really nerve wracking!
Everyone had. to focus and be completely
silent,” Albrecht said.

- At ﬁve minutes to kickoff Hanis said
“take a knee’-’ -for the pre-game prayer.
When it was over,’ and Harris said, “Stand
up,” the players yelled, smacked the walls,
thrashed their heads together, and ran out
"onto the ﬁeld.

“Everyone went crazy,” Kansky said.

“Oh, it “smelled like they had just
played a football game,” Kansky said,
“And you could tell that they were mental-
ly and physically exhausted.” I
“I see now that they work so hard and
go through so much. I saw so manyof them
get hurt and worry about the game. The
experience was something Very special. It is
a really nice thing that I will always remem-
ber,” Kansky said. ‘
Albrecht has only good things to say
about her experience as well. '
‘ “Walt Harris is a truly wonderful man.

’ He acted like we were such intricate parts of

the team. Me and Sarah had so much fun. I
met a great friend. I am so proud of our

I team,” Albrecht said.

Runners will

raise money

for Crohn’s and Colitis

ERIC SLAGLE ‘

Staff Writer

Hundred-s of pairs of running
shoes will descend on Schenley Park
tomorrow morning as people come
out to walk, run and raise money for
the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundationof
America.

Though this year’s event is built
around the popular Pitt-Penn State
challenge, with participants compet-

- ing to raise funds in the name of their

favorite football team, Maria
Polinski, CCFA’s local development
coordinator, said turnout from Pitt
students may not be as high this year
as in the past due to the homecoming-

’ weekend activities.

According to Polinski, the event,
which promises chair massages,
clowns and balloons, and a pair of
tickets to the big game for the partic-
ipant who raises the most money, will
probably bring double the $17,500

last year’s efforts raised.

Polinski said the organization
will use the proceeds raised in tomor-
row’s event for education and
research of the diseases, and to pro-
vide assistance to patients.

Crohn’s disease is a chronic dis-
ease of the gastrointestinal tract.
Currently, medication can control its
symptoms, but its cause and cure are
unknown." A “

Ulcerative colitis is an inﬂam-
matory disease that causes the
inﬂammation and ulceration of the
innermost lining of the colon.

Approximately 1 million
Americans suffer from ulcerative col-
itis or Crohn’s disease; many of them

are young people.

Pitt students may well know
classmates with these diseases.
Polinski said, noting that inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease often strikes peo-
ple. in the college years. People

between the ages of 15 and 35 are
most susceptible to IBDs.

Polinski said people could be suf-
fering from an IBD but not know they
have one. 3

People are often reluctant to dis-
cuss symptoms of the diseases which
include persistent diarrhea, abdomi-
nal cramps and rectal bleeding. She
said the diseases are usually diag-
nosed after everything else has been
ruled out. - _

CCFA educates the public
through newspaper and billboard
advertising and by distributing read-
ing material in doctor’s offices. They
also maintain an informational Web
site.

But Polinski said‘ that CCFA’s
mission to cure and prevent IBDs
through the funding of medical
research is her top priority.

Through genetic linkage mapping
of Crohn’s disease susceptibility loci,
UPMC’s Dr. Richard Duerr is look-
ing for sequences of genetic material
that are shared by people in families
with more than one person afﬂicted
with Crohn’s disease. ’ " ’

Studies show that 20 to 25 per-
cent of patients may have a close rel-
ative with either Crohn’s disease or
ulcerative colitis. Duerr said that
though they had located predisposing
genes and regions, genetics them-
selves did .not cause IBDs, and noted
the importance of environmental fac-
tors. - ,

Duerr said that some patients say
stress can cause the disease to ﬂare,

» though he -points out there is no con-

clusive evidence of this phenomenon.
Duerr said there is a higher inci-

dence of people with IBDs in north— .

ern climates.

Registration for the Sixth Annual
Pace Setter Run/Walk and Family
Fun Day event begins at 8:30 a.m.
tomorrow and the event starts at 9:30
a.m. The cost is $20 per person.

The greatest employment barrier
to many kids at The Hub is a lack of
identification — many kids don’t
even have a social security card’ or
birth certificate. And no ID means no
job. ~
Edmund Harris, 21, has no birth
certificate. He comes to The Hub
almost every day, takingiadvantage
of the good, free service, he says;

Harris has a job cleaning offices
for a nearby business, but he wants
to get a better one, and aspires to
study pre—1aw in college someday.
He spends his nights at the Whale’s
Tale, another shelter for homeless

youths. - .

' “Fifty percent of the kids come
up here from Whale’s Tale,” he says.
“The other half come from their own

' shelters.” T

In 1998, Harris enrolled in the
Job Corps and completed the pro-

gram ‘in 1999. “They gave me an‘

$800 check, I preferred to move to
Pittsburgh [from New York] and got
an apartment. Things went kind of
bad -— Went downhill,” he says. .“I
kind of got pulled in the pit. Now
I’m in the pittrying to get out.”

  Everyone must unite inthe

battle against Penn State

8 Tomorrow we play a football
game against Penn State — this you
already know.

What you may not realize is thatit
is up to the fans to make tomorrow an
all—out battle against our age-old rivals.
Everyone needs to! be a part of the
Panther Strike Force 2000 when _we
declare war against Penn State.

On the most basic level, our battle

strategy involves a lot of yelling. The .

glorious sounds of the “Penn State
sucks” cheer should reverberate inﬁ-
nitely at Three Rivers Stadium tomor-
row, along with other spirit-rousing
chants and shouts of victory.

But our war plan is more extensive
than this. Specially designated students
will inﬁltrate the visiting team section,
disguised in overalls, wife beaters,
grungy ﬂannel and lots of hot pink
apparel, as that majestic shade was one
of PSU’s original colors. _The inﬁltra-
tors will taunt and tease the Penn State
fans in a variety of ways, ranging from
the juvenile (sticking gum in girls’ hair
and making gross faces) to the sophis-
ticated (making boisterous public com-
parisons of Iron City to moonshine).

, Students who are not a part of the
special inﬁltrating squad will be clad in
uniforms consisting of jeans that are not»
stone-washed and an anti-Perm State T-
shirt of choice.

The battle is not over when the
game is won. -After massive partying,
we shall stage an invasion of State

_ College. We will do this by rounding up = ‘
the livelihood of the school — the cows‘ _ ‘

— and herding them westward, and
eating all the ice cream out of the
Creamery, the only thing that Penn
State could justiﬁably brag about.

As benevolent conquerors, we will
carefully remove the straw from
between the students’ teeth and so kind-
ly instruct them about life in the 21st
century. We will clean up ‘their littered
campus and teach ﬂiem about e-mail.

We will import mass shipments of I
Glade Plug-Ins in a powdery fresh’

scent and will thus rid State-College of
its intolerable manure stench. Then we
will take a victory lap around the state,

pulling all of. the Penn State branch I

campuses into our mighty reign VV1th
Penn State out to pasture, wewill return
to Pittsburgh as triumphant heroes.

The less-spirited among you may

wonder why all this is necessary.)
Simple —- it’s our last scheduled game
against our archenemy, we’ve come so
close to winning so many times in
recentyears and a victory against Penn
State would be the ideal way to end the
rivalry and boost the Panthers’ chance
at a winning 2000 season. And if that’s
not enough, Penn State sucks. ’

Yes, Penn State

Of course Penn State sucks, everybody
knows that! The thing that bothers -me is that I‘

we, as Pitt students, basically accept that
notion "on blind faith. We go to Pitt, therefore

Now, before you lynch me and
call me disloyal to the ol’ Alma

because of the rivalry that goes
back into the dawn of time. There are reasons
why Penn State sucks. ’ I
Being from Penn’ State country.(sad but
true, I live less than an hour away, straight up

8 Route 45), I can tell you exactly why Penn

State sucks. Here it goes, in no particular
order: I

1. Penn State is a big campus in a small ‘

town. It is freakin’ huge — as in it takes 30
minutes to cross campus on foot. So is Pitt you
say? Well, Pitt’s in a city, that’s to be expected. ‘
But State College isn’t a city, but merely a
large town. ‘

Penn State’s campus also has a lot of
empty space they could be using for acade-
mics. I mean, there’s green everywhere you
look! If you want greenery, you can go to a
park. Pitt has Schenley Park; Penn State has
the greenest campus on earth! I don’t mind
some greenery, but Penn State took that idea a
little too far. .

2. When you can shorten the coach’s
name, shorten it to something‘ that sounds
good. Consider Penn State’s oh-so-illustrious
coach Joseph Patemo. I mean,’ JoePa? That
sounds dumb! "On the other hand, there’s Pitt’s
Walt Harris. Shortened ‘ somewhat the same
way, it becomes Wal-Ia. As in, ‘WaHa! Time to
kick some Nittany Lion tail!’ Which wo111d
you rather have? , I

3. Penn State spawns like, nobody’s‘ busi-
ness. How many campuses do they have now?
At least 25? Everywhere you turn, there’s a T

sucks, but why?  

Penn State campus; it’s like they’re taking

over thegstate! Pitt only has five campuses, -and —

ﬁve is a nice number. More than one for vari-

ous environments, but not so many as to com- '

‘pletely take over. It’s just right.

 4. Penn State sucks because I
said so. A lame reason to be sure,
but, hey, it works. ’

5. “Penn-. State also sucks

there, atleast where I come from. What ever
happened to being different? Let me put it this

way: if ‘all of your friends were to jump off a’ '
bridge, would you join them? Hopefully not.-

Sirnilarly, if all your friends were to go to Penn

State, would you join them? Hopefully not. :

Let’s hear it for being different! p j
6. Penn State has 40,000 students. Now

tell me, how easy is it to get lost in the shuffle .

when you are one of 40,000 students? Where
do you put them all? I really feel Sony for the
poor folks at Penn State Housing Services.

7. When I went on tour at Penn State, it
was in a big group with about.20 other people.
Here at Pitt, my tour was with one other fami-
ly. There’s a certain personal attention here at
Pitt that didn’t exist at Penn State. I forget who
my Pitt Pathﬁnder was, but that person did an
excellent job. At Penn State, the tour was
rather blah. - '

I’m sure I can go on and on and on un'

' the end of time, but I’Ve done enough Penn

State bashing for one day. I have to save some-
thing for the future, don’t I? Now don’t forget,’
when you’re at the game this coming Saturday,
and the whole nation is watching you cheer on

, your Pitt Panthers, there are three words ‘every-

one should know," so scream them nice and
loud: PENN STACFE SUCKSI! 8

Chris Aurniller had a severe trauma involving

The Pitt News

As Pitt prepares for its “Cat‘

Fight’’' against the Nittany Lions on
Saturday at Three Rivers Stadium,
the question is: will this finally be
the year the Panthers prevail?

Saturday’s game will alsomark
the 96th and final time these two
teams will be matched up, at least
until 2008. .

The series dates back to 1893,
with Penn State leading 50-41-4,
and winning the last seven games
against the Panthers. Pitt’s last win
came in -1988 at Beaver Stadium,
14-7.

This Saturday’s contest will be
felt not only on the football field,
but in the stands at Three Rivers
Stadium and in the city of
Pittsburgh.

Lines to purchase tickets in the
William Pitt Union were beyond
belief all week and student tickets
sold out by Tuesday.

Seasons of traged

Editor’s note; This is a column from
the Penn State student newspaper;
The Daily Collegian, as part of an
exchange with The Pitt News.

On a frigid day in the middle of
March on Terrace Street, I witnessed
one of the greatest sights of my life
while others had tears rolling down
their downtrodden faces.

A wrecking ball was blasting out
the remaining wall of the south end
zone of Pitt Stadium.

So many seasons of tragedy, loss,
grief and disgusting football was

bashed away in a matter of seconds

as several individuals stood by the
medical center watching the destruc-
tion. ’

Those who witnessed the dis-
mantling, along with any other

pathetic Pitt alumni who call them- .

selves Panther fans, carry the memo-
ry of two consecutive decades of
pitiful displays of college football
that took place inside the confines of
the slummy stadium in a slummy
city.’

I laughed with glee as a sweaty,
400—pound, I.C. Light beer-drinking
construction worker running the
crane brought the last semblance of
an actual college football program
down to its knees. I screamed, “Tear
down this (expletive) hole. There’s
only one real football team in this

'99

state, Penn State .

Though ittmight be a rough year
for the Nittany Lions, I will not duck
the obvious; we may have a quarter-
back who could spend next season
playing in the New Jersey Penal
Football League. s

We may have a coach who saw
one of the best teams ever assembled
self—destruct and lose three games at
the end of last season. And yes,
Toledo may have manhandled us, but
the fact remains that we will still
make a bowl game while yinz’s team
languishes in the toilet bowl.

As most major college football
programs begin the season in a battle
to be on top of its conference, Pitt
always pencils in .and writes off the

season that “could” turn into some- ,

thing special.

Yinz’s special season this year
includes playing in a professional
cookie—cutter football stadium that
will also be torn down at the end‘ of
the football season. '

Now let me see if I understand
the reasoning made by the Pitt ath-

letic department of playing in down-.
town Pittsburgh instead of a stadium «

located right on campus.

When football games were
played in —PittjStadium, 500 students
would get off their lazy asses on a
Saturday afternoon and make the
quarter mile journey up Cardiac Hill

' except

to watch two pathetic Big East foot-
ball teams attempt to, play a game
that resembles a real football con-
test. « -

Now .let me ask how many will
make the trek on shuttle buses toa
contest such as the Oct; 21 battle
versus Boston College? I’ll tell you.

NO ONE WILL! And you know
why no one will go to the game?

Because no one cares !-
about .Pitt football,
when yinz
play Penn State. 9

V. At every foot-
ball game the 500!
fans that gather in
the 12th Man Section,
full of frat boys and
sorostitutes that insist on _ , ,
waving stupid wooden poles

- with their Greek letters, st'art;chan_ti—

ng ‘‘Penn State sucks.”
Do yinz really have that much of

an inferiority complex towards our"
fine institution that yinz must insult

us with childish gestures?

Why not just stick yinz’s middle
fingers up at any number of Penn
State alumni driving through the

-streets. of Blitzburgh in Jaguars and
jBMW’s,. i _ ‘ t P ,-
I do the "same wheneverl see Pitt

alumni driving through Centralia,
the Pennsylvania town that is on fire,
in their classic. 1980 Yugo and Chevy’

  
 
  
  
  

y, loss, grief and disgust

Vettes — Chevettes that is.

.It’s time to face facts, Pitt fans.
Yinz are terrible. Yinz’s team is what
the Big East powerhouses such as the

.“Hoaxies” of Virginia Tech and the

"‘Co—Canes” of Miami flush down the
toilet at the end of the season.

In yinz’s eyes, Walt Harris may V

be the nextmessiah coming to save
 . yinz’s “doomed football team.

- However, in the end,
Harris will see he is
on_ ajsinking vessel
and will jump ship

head-coaching
position surfaces.
He will leave
 - and the pathetic city
. of Blitzburgh with beleft
with nothing. I .
So take pride in yinz’s slummy

city, yinz’s slummy campus in South-

Oaktown, and yinz’s appalling foot-

ball team that will be crushed in its.

final rivalry game against a real
squad. .

Go to the Mexican restaurant in
South Oaktown and shake yinz’s

drunken headsin -front of a light pole _

to seev3-D images. 1
_I’ll be standing in the crowd,
proudly wearing my army helmet,

gas mask and Curtis Enis jersey,~

laughing for one last time in the land
of losers with a tear of joy inmy eye.

Holy Toledo! Hail tolthe Trojans!

since school resumed in late‘ August.
Well, the third saying has "

Patemo was a

And here at

The Pitt News, we
know when the time is
right to make fun of Penn

State. Just look at how dumb Patemo
is. If there was ever a time for Paterno
to schedule a series with Pitt,~it would
be right now. Think about it. PSU has-
n’t lost to Pitt since 1988, yet it sched-
ules a Mid—American Conference team
like Toledo and gets its ass kicked.
Why doesn’t Paterno schedule the

 
  
  
 
  
  
 

Panthers?

Oh wait, I know the answer.‘ It’s

because Paterno and the other mem-
bers of his cult in State College are
scared of ‘Pitt. And they should be.

p Hell, if I was Patemo, I’d.be scared of

dropping dead first, but that’s another
column for another time. 1 A
A lot of people around the country

are criticizing Patemo for not suspend- I

ing Rashard Casey over the incident in
which he beat up an off-duty cop in

  ‘Hoboken, N.J. Don’t worry,

f we’re not mad. We know

that any chance of Pitt

Maybe, if ‘ Casey was spending

Some members of the media are
claiming that the game’s main impact

will be on the recruiting trail, but
that’s not true. No matter who wins the
game, potential recruits will still be
faced with the question of whether
they want to go to an urban school

‘ with a brand new stadium and practice

facility, or if they want to go to the
middle of nowhere to graze with the

cows while gaining an education that C

will allow them to work at 7—Eleven _—-
if they’re lucky. Look at former PSU
running back Franco Harris. He spent
four years in State College — and he’s

_ living in Pittsburgh.

The Penn State football program is
dropping faster than you can say Ki-.
Jana Carter. And you can say that pret-
ty quickly. 7 ‘ ' -

- Penn State’s gotten so bad that it‘
lost to Southern Cal in the season-

opener, and the Trojans are coached_ by
former Pitt coach Paul Hackett.
Hackett couldn’t beat Penn’ State when
he was at Pitt, but if there was ever any
proof needed that Patemo is losing it,
it was when Hackett’s USC team beat

. PSU, 29-5.

The main problem with Penn State

this year is the loss of longtime defen— .
I sive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. PSU
_ got rid of the. wrong old guy. Patemo

needed to go, but Sanclusky retired,
and now those vaunted Nittany Lions

defenders have turned into pussy cats.

Maybe Penn State should hire
Bobby Knight to be its next coach. At
least Knight (sorry, I hope he doesn’t
read this and find out I called him by
his last name) could bring some disci-
pline to the program.

The smartest guy in State College
is freshman running back Larry
Johnson, who said that Penn State’s
offense is predictable and never
changes. A-Johnson barely beats out
backup kicker David Kimball, who is
smart because as a” backup kicker on a
team that scores no points, he has to do
no work at all. ‘ . » 

Penn State’s offense is inept. It
doesn’t matter that the Nittany Lions

put up 67 points on Louisiana Tech ~

last week. The Bulldogs’ defense is

about as good as Belgium’s was in u
World War II. Penn State has scored .

about as much as that guy in the movie
“American Pie.” If you haven’t seen
the movie, he’s not exactly a ladies’
man. '

without some controversy. On
Tuesday morning, it was reported
that Joe Paterno, head coach of

Penn State, accused Pitt of not

sending the videotapes it was sup-
posed to receive.

In a press conference that after-
noon, Pitt ‘coach Walt Harris dis-
missed any controversy.

“The ‘University. of Pittsburgh
has met all of its film exchange
obligations to Penn State fully and
on time. Never once have we per-
sonally received a complaint from
Penn State regarding film
exchanges,” Harris said. “If Coach

Paterno wants to throw around
‘ some inaccurate charges or mislead

the public, then so be it.”
‘During Paterno’s press confer-
ence the next afternoon, he down-
played thesituation. _ '
“I am not angry at [Pitt]. I just
didn’t get anytapes 

“They didn’t want to exchange,
which is fine.” ._ .

Harris" blamed himself after
Saturday’s game and said that the

Panthers would need to run the ball ,

better to have a chance of beating

' Penn State.

-After scoring a total of 11
points in its first two games, Penn
State scored 67'points last Saturday
against Louisiana Tech.

The explosive offense was led

by quarterback Rashard Casey.

Casey was l2—for—l5 against the
Bulldogs and threw for five touch-
downs in the win. Eric McCoo leads
the Penn State running game and is
averaging 4.6 yards per carry.

Wide receiver Sam Crenshaw
averages .12.8 yards per catch
through the first three games, but
injured his leg on Saturday.

Crenshaw hadn’t practiced as of

.Wednesday, and his status for the

game is questionable. ' .

The Panthers defense will face
its toughest offense against Penn
State. ' '

They have given up only 23
points, and 13 of those came after
the second—team defense was put in
against Bowling Green.

“I’m excited our defense is
playing solidly, but that’s what we
have to do,” Harris said.

Defensive end Bryan Knight
leads the Panthers with four sacks,
all of ‘which came against Bowling

Pitt also has three interceptions

The Penn State defense strug-
gled through its first two games,
giving up 29 points to Southern
California and‘24 points at home
against Toledo.

They came back with a strong
effort against Louisiana Tech last
week-, giving up only one touch-
down early in the game.

Defensive end Michael Haynes
has stepped up with two sacks and
two tackles for a loss of yardage.

“I think Michael Haynes is com-
ing along and getting better all the
time,” Paterno said.

can cover Grim and Bryant.

especially, overall, proof that the
Panthers are a team and not just
Dorsett, as many people have sug-
gested.

“Although Tony was the man
people came to see,” Majors said in
a hectic Pitt locker room, after
Dorsett had rushed for 224 yards to
finish the regular season with 1,948
yards and 6,082 for his career. “I
have to agree that it was the team
effort which did it.”

And that team effort gelled in
the second half of the ball game
when Pitt broke a 7-7 deadlock to
roll over the team which has reigned
supreme in the East over the past
decade.

What began as a battle of punt-
ing between Pitt’s Larry Snyder
(who punted five times for a, 45.1
yard average, including ,a 51-
yarder) and State’s Scott Fitzkee

(41.3 average) turned into continu—_

ally good field position for the
Lions and a Penn State score with
just over three minutes left in the
opening quarter. . .
Starting in excellent position at
the Pitt 45, it took the Lions only
six plays to march down the slip-
pery-, rain-soaked artificial surface
to break the scoreless tie.
Quarterback Chuck Fusina, a sopho-
more who took over for injured
John Andress early in the season,

spotted fullback Bob Torrey in the

flat, in what appeared to be a
delayed screen; and the Penn State

Azzmiéi rrmwaarsmsrmtmex 

blockers took over to clear a, 21-.

yard path to -the end zone for Torrey,
who scampered in for the opening

1 touchdown. The extra point by Tony.

Capozzoli ended what was surpris-
ingly the only Lionscoringp. The big
play in the drive was a 27-yard toss
from’Fusina to split end Rich Mauti.

The first quarter ended with no
furtheraction, but the second period
was a different story. The Panthers
came up with three’ turnovers —
interceptions by‘ J .C. Wilson and
Jeff Delaney and a fumble recovery
by walk-on Glenn Meyer — but a
return interception of .a Matt
Cavanaugh pass by Rick Donaldson
and a missed field goal attempt
from 31 yards out by Long, his
fourth miss in a row over two sea-
sons against the Lions, delayed the

mt;

Panther bomb from exploding until

the -fourth quarter.

After Pitt’s first theftby Wilson
early in the second period, the
Panthers-’ march was stopped by
Donaldson, but at the Penn State
eight, from where the Lions could
not move and were forced to punt
and give the Panthers idealfield
position at the State 41. After

Cavanaugh passed to split end A
Gordon Jones (four catches for 11

yards) for a pick-up of -26 yards to .
the Lion 13, it was‘ three plays by
‘ Dorsett, the third aneasy run to the

left from six yards out with a
Cavanaugh pitch,-got Pitt its first
touchdown. -
Long, who was awarded the
game ball, knotted the game at
seven apiece, but his field goal try
after Meyer’s fumble recovery a

‘minute and a half later ‘sailed, wid

to the left. ' ‘-
“Penn State will knock you
tails off,” Majors commented on the

‘ first half of play. .“They‘were'the f

aggressor and out .offe‘nsive linewas
getting whipped forawhile, and
they surprised us with a couple _of
different defenses we hadn’t seen.

That and poor field position made

the game ‘a dogfight.” T .

Dorsett was held. to" -only 58 2

yards in 16 carries inthe first half,

so Majors played the trickster,
against the Lions, coming out in the ,
second half in an unbalanced line’

with Dorsettpthe deep back in the

formation aswell as one of the "split

backs in the Veer.

“The. first two years, we used
the I formation and I gave him
[Dorsett] the ball a lot,” Majors
explained. “The last two years,
we’-ve mixed the I and the two split
backs to kind’ of keep people‘ off
balance on defense so they couldn’t
key on him all the time.” ’

The third quarter of play started
out much like the second, probably
because of the steady rain which
began to fall just before gametime
and drenched the 50,360 fans on
hand for thegnationally-televised
affair. ' -

Takingthe kickoff, the Panthers

drove to the Lions 32, but
Cavanaugh’s pass to Taylor was

picked off by Lion defensive end ' 4
, ‘Joe Diange at the 20. Several plays

later, Pitt’s Bob Jury intercepted a
Fusina bomb-to Mauti at the Pitt 13
and returned the theft to the Panther

drive, this time -to the State 15-yard
line, but fullback Bobby Hutton

around right end for three more to
the 40 of Penn State. ‘

The next play was one of the
many record breaking runs Dorsett
has recorded in the finest year and
career of any running back in the
history of college football.

The 40-yard bolt, in which he
merely pecked his way up the mid-
dle, then accelerated in a way that
only he can, Dorsett broke the scor-
ing record of Glenn Davis of Army
(1943-46) by amassing his 356th
career point and tied two records of
Ohio State’s Archie Griffin (now
with the Cincinnati Bengals) -
most 100—yard games in a season
(11) and a career (33, a most appro-
priate number). ,

The third quarter ended with
Pitt on top 14-7, but the Panthers
were rolling and needed only four
plays in their next series to drive 45
yards for another "score, a 12-yard
burst up the middle by Elliott
Walker, with a minute elapsed in the
final period, through a big hole pro-
duced bythe Panther offensive line.
It was Walker’s first touchdown run
since a 69 yarder against Navy five
games ago.

_, But the runs which gained even
more recognition were an 11-yard
spurt up the middle to put Dorsett at
the unprecedented 6,000-yard mark
as the third quarter ended and a

quick pitch around left end one play
later for 17 yards, which gave the
“Hopewell Express” 160 yards on
the evening to surpass the single-
season rushing mark of 1,881 set by
Cornel1’s Ed Marinaro in 1971.
Another conversion by Long
made the score 21-7 and after Jury
intercepted his secondrpass of the

game and his ninth of the season,

tops in the nation, several plays
later, Long, the all—time leading
scorer by kicking, sent a 47-yarder
through the uprights with less than
12 minutes left in the game, and
was so happy that he jumped up and
down in jubilation and did a somer-
sault at midfield. -

The scoring was finished, but
Dorsett wasn’t. The holder of 14
NCAA major college records
escaped the grasps of a tired Penn
State defense for a 42-yard gain
which put him over the 200—yard
mark for the ninth time in his
career.

“I thought we were the better,
team,” came an obvious statement
from Majors. “But that’s not think-
ing lightly of Penn State, because
they’re‘much younger than we are.
They are a team with fine ability
and fine young people, but we’re
more experienced and we have a lot
of ability.”

“This was our biggest win here.
It climaxed four years of work on
what we started to do,” Majors
added. - »
