Election waits
for absentees

, Don’t wait up for a new president, there won’t'/be one
for at least a week. I '
There are still 30,000 overseas and military votes,
and it is notqknown how many of these were tallied.
These ballots have a 10-day grace period to be counted,

as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 7.

That 10-day grace period might be changed, but
regardless, no one will know, who the new president is
until at least Nov. 17. Also, the Electoral College could
be unable to meet on Dec. 18 should the race last that
long. Under normal circumstances the Electoral College
casts its formal ballots that day. ‘

At 6:10 p.m. Thursday, Florida Secretary of State
Katherine Harris with Bob Crawford of the Florida
Agriculture Commission and Clay Roberts, who is in

, charge at therecount, held a press conference. Harris said .
I that according to the official vote count that began at ,8
» a.m. Thursday, 53 counties had reported, making the offi-

cial popular vote in Florida 2,909,661 to 2,907,877, with
George W. Bush leading Al Gore by 1,784 popular votes.

The Republicans requested for a second machine _

recount and the Democrats asked for a hand recount.
Both were granted and will take place at 9 a.m. Saturday.
However, these recounts will only be with 1 percent of
the population which total about 400,000 votes.

In Missouri, dozens of ballot boxes were allegedly
left unguarded, and one voting booth was found on a
street corner.

Yesterday, Sen. Christopher Bond, R—Miss., said that

he suspects voter fraud and that polling stations were ‘

kept open too long in Democratic areas. Supposedly,
these polling stations were extended against federal rule.
He has contacted the US Attorney General’s office, as
well as FBI Director Louis Freeh about looking into
reports that packed polls in St. Louis were kept open for
an extra 40 minutes. ' S

It has been ‘said that if there is a revote, Bush advis-
ers might demand a recount in Iowa, Wisconsin and New
Mexico — all states that Gore won by very close mar-
gins.

At 1:10 p.m. yesterday, there were rallies and protests
led by Rev. Jesse Jackson and the NAACP in Palm Beach
County, Fla. It has been reported that there were minor
protests all day.

Yesterday at 2:30 p.m., Judge Kenneth Ricecap was
supposed to hold an emergency hearing in Palm Beach
County. Numerous lawsuits have been ﬁled regarding the
possibility of a revote in Palm Beach County because of
the nearly 2000 voters. who reported voting for Patrick J.
Buchanan insteadof Gore because of ballot confusion.
Buchanan received 3,407 votes in Palm Beach County.
That is five times the amount he received in Dade

As the presidential election draws to a controversial
close in Florida, the election season is just beginning at
Pitt, with equal drama. “ , ‘

The three Student Government Board presidential
candidates convened last night at ﬂue William Pitt Union
to further introduce themselves and debate seven stu-

dent-interest issues based on a recent forum held by the

Student Government Board.

While no recounts or re—votes have been ordered
yet, the verbal battle is heating up between Este Griffith,
Michael Guss and Michael Unangst.

, The debate, sponsored by the SGB Elections
Committee, began with a four-minute monologue by
each candidate, followed by a period during which can-
didates were able to answer student questions and
debate among themselves. A

Guss spoke ﬁrst, removing ﬂie microphone from in
front of him and walking in front of the table where the
candidates were seated. ‘

“I don’t like sitting behind a table,” he said, explain-
ing that his knees often hit the bottom.

He immediately announced, “I believe the system
is broke.” ’

He also corrected a comment he made at Meet the

the William Pitt Uion alﬁlt FeireVl'e\\'sSoni¢:handginge5t"‘ﬁ (3tm’¢5i t ioard. R  
candidates debate  

Candidates, saying he pledges to spend six hours each
week — not each day — at the Cathedral of Learning
to listen to and help students.

He also declared that SGB has been an elitist orga-
nization in the past, and complained that the ballroom
was only half-full, with about 70 students

“This roomis half—empty, and it could be full,” he
said.

Guss also pledged to honor the $150 spending cap
regarding his campaign. 0

“Politics isn’t about who you know and who you
owe — it isn’t about my face,” he said. “It’s about my
ideas.” ‘ .

He said the election is about issues including re-

d opening the nursing library, ﬁghting Sodexho-Maniot,

improving shuttle service to Sutherland and getting bet-
ter tuition rates. He encouraged student unity. . ‘

Griﬂith, remaining seated, said her campaign was
all about “knocking down walls.”

She repeated her campaign mantra,
“Communication, information, action.”

She proposed an SGB‘ publication answering to
students, explaining what both the SGB and the ad1nin—
istration were doing. She said the administration has a
vested interest in keeping the student body uninformed.

“Student government doesn’t stand up for us often

When Joan Snyder travels to‘

other colleges, she is jealous. ,

“I’m jealous of the energy I see
on the other campuses,” said the
Student Government Board presi-
dent at a forum last night. “I’m jeal-
ous these other schools have such
pride in their university.”

Snyder believes that the lack of
a university identity is harming the
University psyche and ultimately
leads to decreased enrollment, and
especially retention of current fresh-
man. One way to counter these
effects, said Snyder, is to start annu-
al Pitt traditions that unite faculty,
students and alumni.

Last night, the provost’s‘office
and Student Government Board held
an open forum for students to brain-
storm ideas for a tradition.

Dr. Jack Daniel, vice provost for
academic affairs, attended the forum
as a faculty representative.

“Hopefully, we’ll end up with a

‘ strong collective community,” said

Daniel about the possibility of some
sort of annual tradition. “The more
students get involved, the more they

get out of all facets of their life here

. at Pitt, both socially and academi-

cally.”

Most of the ideas presented by
the -roughly 25 students who attend-
ed the forum revolved around either
a service activity or a large concert.

“Music brings people together,”
Jason Rogers said. “The average
everyday student won’t take an
interest in just volunteering. But a
major social event will get the aver-
age student to attend.”

Others thought some sort of car-
nival or festival could unite Pitt.

“With the stadium gone, there’s
nothing on campus that gets people
excited,” said Cherise Cardie, a
sophomore at Pitt. “A . carnival
would be a lot of fun.”

Students also debated whether
the involvement of different campus
organizations creates more student
involvement or fosters alienation.

“When I see an event sponsored
by a specific group that I don’t

belong to, I usually don’t go,”,

Cardie said. “I guess I just feel I
don’t belong there. I’d be an out-
sider.”

“One way for the carnival tobe
a success would be for different
groups to each have a booth,” coun-

involvement
would prove
school.

“Just think of the institutional
value if thousands of kids say every
year that they go to Pitt and these
students there do lots of great things
for them,” Daniel said.

Snyder believed these ideas
underscored a major factor that
would unite, students. “Everyone
wants to have fun.” , '

Snyder repeatedly stressed to
Daniel the importance of full
University support. '

“It’s not going to be something
students do alone,” she said. “It
needs to involve faculty, staff and
administrators. Whatever it is, it
needs to be primary on the
University’s agenda.” .

At the end of the two—hour

believed community
in such a festival
invaluable _to the

forum, Daniel thanked the students

for their participation, but made no
promises about the possibility of a
solid tradition. ‘
“We have a lot more dialoguing
we need to do before we ’ know

where we are,” Daniel said.

ew University traditions

“There’s a lot of things we could go
and do right now, but I don’t know
 I want to spend the rest of this
semester gathering information.”

Some attendees perceived this as
the administration spinning its col-
lective wheels.

“We need to implement a plan
soon,” said Mike Unangst. “There’s
ajpoint where there’ll be a -billion
dollars invested in this University
but no students. Where do you see
the point where we take action?”

“The administration is not
asleep on this issue,” promised
Daniel,,who called for the creation
of a committee to create a plan.

“By March, I want to be able to
present a concrete plan of action,”
he said.

Snyder believed the forum was a
successful first step in creating new
Pitt traditions. ‘

“I love any event that creates a
dialogue,” said Snyder afterward. “I

wouldn’t have thought of half the ‘

ideas that circulated throughhere.

 Dr. Daniel has always held up his 6

end of the faculty-student coopera-
tive and I have complete confidence
something big will happen here. It
won’t happen overnight, but it will
happen.” ’

Board candidates present platforms at student forum

S KARA WILSON

Staff Writer

Eleven candidates rtmning for the
eight Student Government Board posi-

. tions gathered Wednesday night in the

‘William Pitt Union Ballroom at the “2000
Meet the Candidates” forum to address
students. ’

Each ‘candidate had two minutes to
discuss various issues, including the rea-
sons. behind their decision to run for a
board position and what" they hope to
accomplish if elected. After each candi-
date’s two minute discourse, the audience
had the opportunity to ask questions of the
candidates. .

The ﬁrst candidate to. speak was junior
Rebecca Normand. She addressed safety
issues on campus and said that the number
of blue lights and police phones in both
North and South Oakland needs to be
increased. She also plans to work with Van

Call to increase its efficiency.

During her ﬁnal seconds, Normand
said that she wants to rebuild the student
escort system and reinstitute the self-
defense classes that were an option.

' Second to speak, sophomore Jeff Alex
addressed issues faced by students living
off campus. His opinion is that landlords
need to ‘be more responsible for their prop-

Alex next addressed issues dealing

with Pitt’s football stadium, saying that he
wants to make more parking spaces avail-
able, inform students exactly where the
student seating section is located and cre-
ate a more efficient shuttle system. Alex
concluded that, “in working together,

-we’ll get things done.”

Senior Jeff Weber spoke next. He pro-
posed that more concerts should be offered
at Pitt, saying that “in order to’ crack down
on underage drinking, we have to provide
the students with something better to do.”
Weber also addressed the controversy sur-
rounding the Constitutional Review
Committee and said that he knows how
the process functions and will work ' to
clear up the disputes.

Sarah Dadlani, a junior, stressed the
importance of “cornrnunication, inforn1a-
tion and action.” She said that students
possess the energy to make a difference

V and that “with communication and infor-

mation on our side, we will be able to
knock down the walls between students
and govemment.” Dadlani hopes to build
unity among students. She also wants to
provide the students with the voice to take
action on campus. _
Senior Joel Thurston addressed the
problem of numbers. He said that it is very
difficult for eight board members and one
president to efficiently represent the
15,000 Pitt students. He proposed a 40-
member senate to promote the student
body’s voice. Thurston also said he will

clarify the allocation process and consoli-
dateefforts in funding.

The next candidate to address the
audience was Junior Kya O’Queen. She
said that SGB should be “accessible,
accountable and diverse” and have a “pos-
itive, inviting and a supportive atmos-
phere.” O’Queen asked why part-time stu-
dents are teaching many of Pitt’s major
courses.

She further stated, “we need to stand
behind our faculty so that we get the edu-
cation we are here for.”

O’Queen’s conclusion stressed the
need for unity on campus, and said, “if we
start building together, we can create
change.”

Seventh to speak was Junior Rob
Brown. He was concerned with how acad-
emics and social issues should go hand—in—
hand. He also wants to increase the repre-
sentation of many multicultural associa-
tions in SGB in order to increase program-
ming. Brown also hopes to build a better
sense of community on campus.

To this end, Brown said‘, “we need to
communicate more.”

In conclusion, Brown stated that he
wants to increase representation on the
board through changes in the constitution.

Sophomore Alan Hollander wanted to

. address issues important to Pitt students.

Hollander also wanted to get more people
involved on campus and working together.
To create this sense of community, he pro-

posed a campus Olympiad that he hoped
will bring campus groups together. ,

Junior Steven Nikoloff spoke next,
whose platform is to “exercise your
voice.” He thinks that student apathy is
high. In response, Nikoloff proposes to
create small, special-interest task forces,
and wants to create a forum, where stu-
dents can voice their concerns and propose
solutions. He said that “by using our diver-
sity, we can create unity, which can then
generate change.”

Jay Dworin, a senior, believes that
“new bridges need to be built between stu-
dents and faculty.” He wants classes to
offer an online chat room in which stu-
dents can get in touch with teachers to ask
questions.

Dworin also says that “we need a stu-
dent government board where the people
represent every one of the students.” He is
“looking to build the bridges, knock down
walls and make things happen.” _

The ﬁnal candidate to speak on
Wednesday night was junior Desiree
Wﬂharns, who, along with Sarah Dadlani
believes that SGB should be about “com-
munication, information and action.” She
wants to inform the students and says that
students should “vote for knocking down
the walls, vote for empowerment and vote
for action.”

The 12th board candidate is Rob
Loper _ who was unable to attend
Wednesday night’s forum.

County, a county with almost double
the population of Palm Beach County.

It has been reported that those bal-
lots were not in compliance with state
law. ’

Sample ballots were sent out
ahead of time, but there were_no holes
in those ballots. When voters got into
the voting booths, the holes did not
line up with the arrows pointing to the
candidates’ names, creating confusion
among many. There were also 19,120
ballots thrown out because they were
punched twice. 0

When Judge Ricecap entered the
courtroom to consider the case, the
lawyers withdrew the lawsuit. It is
suspected that lawyers will refile the
case on a state level instead of a feder-

al one, but it is still unknown.

This is because under Florida state
law, state judges are mandated to look
at votes and if that judge feels that the
results are skewed, he is bound by law
to adjust them. That could mean a
revote. ' ,

The Democrats have set up phone
banks in Florida, and have received
more than 5,000 calls since yesterday
morning from people claiming that
they are unsure about who they cast
their vote for. 0

Reform Party candidate Buchanan
suggested to reporters that Gore might
have won Florida, and‘ therefore the
election, if the ballot mistake had not
occurred.

Gore campaign Chairman William
Daley said the Gore campaign will
support but will not initiate any legal
action. _ -

S of the action phase of her plan.
Organization, she said, is vital to any

plans being implemented.
Unangst rounded out the group, begin-

ning by promising “experience and a plan,” '

as he too walked in front of the table.

VV1th experience as a resident assistant,
and a sexual assault peer educator and his
work on the Senate Budget Planning
Committee, in addition to his two years on
the board, Unangst said he has a record that
proves he will be able to accomplish what
he promises. . _ ,

He attributed any problems with SGB
to poor communication.

“I feel as if it’s because we’re not all on '

the sa_me page,” he said. He felt this was true
between the administration and the SGB, as
well as the students, and ﬂue SGB. “No one’s
working toward any common goals,” he
said

He saidthatitisunrealistictoexpect
the new Board to solve every problem dur-

. ing the few months it will be in power.

The seven topics addressed by the can-
didates were student health services, park-
ing and transportation, food services, com-
puting, residence ;life, communication and
representation. Each candidate had ﬁve
minutes to address ﬁve of the seven topics.
Students in the audience were instructed to
use this time to formulate issue-specific
questions for one of the candidates.

During the ﬁve—minute period, Guss
reiterated his disgust with the current SGB.
He said it is impossible to represent every
person on campus. 0

“It’s a bunch of crap,” he said. “Just
because you win doesn’t mean you can

work together like ducks in a row or canbe
happy,” he said. _ .

He said he will use his time to listen to
and act on student concerns.

“It’s not worth it to sit around and
scheme and plot like both of my opponents
have done,” he said. “It should be about lis-
tening to you.”

He proposed ensuring that there is soap  I

in the bathrooms in Towers “so people don’t
get diseases “ He also advocated revamping
the prices in campus eateries.

0 ‘,‘I’m sick and tired of paying $6 to $7

‘for the equivalent of piece of pizza, a bag of

chips, a piece of fruit and a large soda,” he
said. 0’

He ended with a warning.

“If we continue on the way it is, noth-
ing ain’t gonna get done,” emphasizing the
importance for a new face in SGB. _

Griiﬁth stressed that communication is
a “vital component of student govemment.”

She also talked about the importance. of
empowering students to confront problems
they encounter on their own.

“When you win your own battle, that’s
yours,” she said. .

She proposed making any changes to
SGB, including a senate, system or elected
chairman system via the Constitutional

She also pledged to continue the ﬁght
for student representation on the Board of
Trustees, in addition to representation with-
in student health services.

“We all need to make sure student gov- ’

emment is  helping us,” she said.
, Unangst reiterated the inability of the
board to conquer all topics during its rela-

. tively short tenure, but promised to com-
- plete what students wanted him to com-

plete.

He outlined a speciﬁc plan to change
problems shuttle system, regarding funding
and lobbying. He also said student health
should be open 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. . '

He said residence life can “go further,”
and that people living inside of lounges was
“unacceptable.”

“The reality is that we . pay the bills

‘around here.”

. Again, he stressed setting short-term
goals for the new board. “In four months we

_ can’t attack everything,” he said.

Answering a student question about
how well he’d be able to work with a possi-
bly uncooperative board, Guss said it is
important to recognize that it won’t be his
board —— it will be the students’ board.

~ “I’ll never call it my board,” he said-.

‘ Unangst replied to a question, about the
importance of communication in holding
candidates —— and eventually the president
— accountable.

accomplished next to nothing in his two
years on board. .

Answering the question of how to get
students to work together, Grifﬁthsaid ﬂiat
students should feel they have ownership
over what they are passionate about so they
want to get involved. .

Guss pointed out that only 5 percent of
students voted in the recent referendum.

“Oh yeah do we have a real mandate to
represent,” he said. “I know what people
want, and I’ll give it to them.” He also

declared that the other candidates were wor- -

ried about losing the election. .
Unangst responded ﬁrst to a question

regarding helping students who are ﬁnan-

cially unable to stay in school. He pledged

' to help students to utilize the tools already in

place in the University to ﬁnd help.

He also criti-

for an SGB-based
publication, calling it
“propagan .”

-“Something Este Gﬁfﬁth

said. » ’

She further talked about the publication

_ by addressing a student question about

where ftmding for the piece would ‘come

She promised to take the money from
the student activities fee, which she deemed
a good use for the allocation.

Unangst said the University should be
responsible for paying to make its own
improvements‘. .

Guss declared that neither of his oppo-
nents had done enough to ﬁght for students,
saying Griﬂith'hadn’t fought hard enough

“I’ll go to

his strong plans to

tioned his substance.

“Where’s the
beef,” he asked.
v .. ‘‘Let’s ’make it our
board; let’s make it our student government,
let’s take it back,” he said.

Grifﬁth said her philosophy is the best
regarding the kind of SGB students want.

After the debate, Grifﬁth and Unangst
were satisﬁed.

“On the part of some candidates, it was
informative,” Unangst said. .

“I thinkit went really well,” Grifﬁth
said.

Unangst was apologetic. “I blew it,” -he
said. “I apologize to people for the personal

mg.”

He remained optimistic, though. “I

OPINIONS  

EDITORIAL
Voting procedures should be

standardized in future elections

We have at least a week of waiting
until we ﬁnd out who the next presi-
dent of our nation will be, as Nov. 17 is
the deadline for Florida to receive
absentee ballots from overseas resi-
dents.

In this situation, a week is a long
time to wait. During that period, some
of us are going to worry. Some of us
are going to start demanding recounts.
Some of us are going to pray desper-
ately that our preferred candidate even-
tually triumphs. And a lot of us are
going to use the time to think about
voting procedures in America, and
realize that the methods we currently
use are in dire need of improvement.

The bizarre unfolding of the 2000
presidential election has made painful-
ly obvious several nuances in the
American voting system. Under the
Constitution, states have the right to
specify voting procedures for all elec-
tions, and this can cause problems
when different states have very differ-
ent methods of voting in a presidential
race.

Two main examples of such prob-
lems come to mind, the ﬁrst being that
we still do not know which candidate
won the electoral votes from the state
of Oregon, because Oregon operates
on a mail—in ballot system This time it
is not so signiﬁcant, since the state’s
seven electoral votes are not enough to

give either George W. Bush or Al Gore
the necessary 270. But waiting on
Oregon could become an issue in
fut11re elections. 0

Perhaps more importantly, some
voters in Palm Beach County, Fla,
have argued that because of the way
the ballot was laid out, they mistakenly
voted for Reform Party candidate
Patrick J. Buchanan when they intend-
ed to vote for Gore. As a result, repre-
sentatives from both parties are

demanding a recount for the county.

In the future, these discrepancies
could be eliminated by standardizing
presidential elections on a national
level. The federal government should
establish a standard method of voting
technology for all states to use in
national elections. Furthermore, the
government should establish strict
guidelines for poll workers, to ensure
that they check voters’ identiﬁcation in
order to prevent potential fraud and
clearly explain the process to confused
voters.‘

Since a state’s right to run both
local and federal elections is a part of
the Constitution, changing the process
would mean ratifying an amendment.
But judging by the chaos and contro-
versy that the current system has creat-
ed, in Palm Beach County and
arguably in other places, it seems that it
might be worth making such an effort.

It doesn’t seem to matter where
in the world the opponents are
from, the Pitt Women’s basketball
team finds a way to win.

The Panthers won their second
and final exhibition game of the
season with an 89-60 victory over
the Shelen team from Russia.

“I was very pleased with the
team’s effort,” said head coach
Traci Waites. “They did all they
were asked to do.”

Pitt jumped out to an early 2-0
lead on a layup by forward Celeste
Barkley. Barkley then added one to
the lead on a foul shot, but Shelen
answered right back with baskets

from Tatiana Erchova and Natalia,

Leontieva.

The Panthers regained the lead
on a layup by Mandy Wittenmyer,
but then Shelen gained momentum,
taking an 8-point lead twice before
two points from freshman Jenean
Ford sparked the Pitt offense. Ford
went to the free throw line and
made one of two shots and then

added a layup.
Fellow. freshman _
Sheila Stufflet
made one of her
own to bring the
Panthers within
one point.

Stufflet then
sank a free throw
to tie the game
and Ford made a
layup to put the
Panthers in front.
The lead then
went back ,. to
Shelen as Ksenia
Kolosovakaia hit
a three pointer
and then a layup
to give her team
a 24-21 lead.

B r o o k e
Stewart then hit
the first of her
four three-point-
ers in the game,
but n
countered with one of her own to
give Shelen the 27-24 advantage.
Pitt moved within one on a jumper
by Monique Toney and then once

again pulled in front on a basket by
Jessica Ryndycz to take a lead it
would keep the entire game. The

Panthers finished the half with a 41- ‘

199 7: 21-1 7 homecoming victory over‘ Miami

Editor’s Note: This is the 11th of the “Greatest Games”
series that will appear in The Pitt News the day before
each Pitt football game this year. Each part in the series
will detail Pitt’s greatest game against that week’s oppo-
nent and will contain the original game story as it
appeared in The Pitt News. This story was published on
Sept. 22, 1997, and was written by Geoﬁ"Moak.

Defensive back John Jenkins agreed.

“Being a ﬁfth—year senior, that’s what you dream
of,” he said. “You see guys at the big-time programs
winning a game and their fans ripping down the goal-
posts, you think ‘That would be nice.’ Our fans were out-
rageous tonight. We appreciate that.”

The game didn’t start off so well for Pitt. On the

The Pitt defense opened the second quarter with the
ﬁrst of several big plays in the game. Miami was look-
ing to cap a drive that had started at their own 2-yard-
line. On a third—down play from Pitt’s 5, Eric
Kasperowicz — who came into the game just -minutes
earlier when E.C. Varoutsos suffered a slight concussion
— sacked Clement and forced a fumble.

, . . . , ; . . . . , . . . . . .

As the clock neared midnight last Thursday, the
Pittsburgh Panthers put the finishing
touches on a most improbable fairy
tale. In what may well be the game
looked back upon as the one that put
Pitt football back on the map, the
Panthers earned a 21-17 Homecoming
victory over the Miami Hurricanes, the
No. 22 team in the country.

Not content to let the players have
all the fun, fans streamed onto the ﬁeld
even before the final gun, tearing
down the goalpost in the north end zone. Actually,
according to Pitt head coach Walt Harris, the fans were
almost as important as the players in this win.

“One of the most exciting things was to see that

atmosphere out there. The spirit, the fans yelling and
screaming  that was college football at its best. I can’t
tell you how much that helped us,” Hanis said.

. . . . , . , . . . . , . . , . . . . . .

third play of the game, Miami quarterback Ryan
Clement hit fullback Carlo Joseph in the ﬂat. Joseph

  

er Cheo «Angel,

sidestepped Chiffon Allen and Jenkins
and took the pass 57 yards for a touch-
down.

The star of the game, Pitt quarterback
Pete Gonzalez, would get the Panthers
on the board later the quarter. On Pitt’s
second possession, Gonzalez started
the drive by scrambling for 20 of his 63
rushing yards on the game, taking Pitt
into Miami territory. On a bizarre ﬂea-

ﬂicker, Gonzalez passed to wide receiv- ,

who threw back to Gonzalez for a 23-

yard gain. Gonzalez finished the drive with a more tradi-
tional 4-yard touchdown pass to Terry Murphy. A penal-
ty for excessive celebration pushed the extra point
attempt back 15 yards and Chris Ferencik missed the
kick, so Pitt was still down 7-6 at the end of the first

quarter.

Several Panthers had a chance to recover the ball,
but it rolled all the way back to the Pitt 48 yard line,
where it finally went out of bounds, taking the
Huiiicanes out of ﬁeld-goal range and keeping their lead
at one point.

Gonzalez made the Hunicanes pay. Seeing virtually
no pressure from Miami’s front seven, Gonzalez picked
apart the secondary, completing seven of nine passes for
79 yards on the next drive. A 10-yard touchdown pass to
Jake Hoffart ended the drive. A shovel pass to Dwayne
Schulters for the 2-point conversion gave the Panthers a
14-7 lead, and the Panthers would not trail again.

Pitt’s only other serious threat in the first half was
foiled when Chris Ferencik missed a 24-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt wide left with 4:23 remaining in the half. Miami
drove the ball back downfield to Pitt’s 24-yard-line with
just over a minute to go in the half, but another huge
third-down sack, this one by Ernest Coakley, took the

Voting in Florida has
  effect on Hurricanes

We, the never wrong members of
the football media, have decided to award
the state of Florida to the University of
Miami on its 20-point victory over Pitt
even though 0 percent of the precincts are
reporting.

Let’s now go to the map and see how

Miami now has 282 BCSECPC

that’s all that really matters to
the pollsters, big wins. It has
defeated quality opponents in

Tech but still needs to show
no mercy and get blowouts
in their final three games to gain those
important BCSECPC Votes.

But the Panthers Party is not done yet.
It can still win this election with solid vic-
tories in the Philadelphia. and
Morgantown, W.V., O precincts. Party
leader Walt Harris said this Week that his
candidates are more focused and have
been campaigning a lot harder.

This is different from last week when
the Panthers campaigned for North
Carolina. Harris was so upset about the
candidates lackadaisical approach last
week that he even stopped them on the

campaign trail to make them do extra con— i

ditioning.

But solid campaigning may not be
enough to overtake Miami. Hurricanes
Party leader Butch Davis has great candi-
dates.

Quarterback Ken Dorsey may be
young, but he can deliver his message
long and across the middle. He gets solid
protection from his experienced offen-
sive-line party that makes big voting holes
for tailback James Jackson. Charismatic
wide receivers Santana Moss and Reggie
Wayne make defense issues seem like a
joke.

Davis’ defensive party members are
solid and use many political blitzing
stunts to confuse opponents. That way,
defensive ends Cornelius and Jamaal
Green or linebacker Dan Morgan can
inﬁltrate the opposing party’s voters and
send their message of pain first. ‘

But hold on, I have breaking news.
Several precincts are now reporting in and
it appears that Pitt is taking a lead in
Florida with precision execution on
offense. It seems that Harris has again

Hurricanes out of ﬁeld goal range again,
and the score stood at 14-7 at halftime.

Having been burned by the Pitt ﬂea-
ﬂicker in the first half, Miami reached
into its bag of tricks early in the second.
When their first drive stalled on Pitt’s 15-
yard line, the Hurricanes lined up for a
ﬁeld goal. Holder Jeff Popovich picked
the ball up and threw a perfect pass to
Daniel Franks in the back of the end zone.

“’Ihat’s about as good as you can do
it,” Harris said of the trick play.
“[Popovich] could probably could play
quarterback for them sometime.”

Both offenses took the rest of the
third quarter off, but Pitt’s defense was as
sharp as ever. The coverage by Pitt’s sec-
ondary on lVIiami’s receivers was loose in
the first half, but tightened up consider-
ably in the second. After gaining 161

yards passing in the first half, t_h__e 
Hurricanes managed just 96 in the seco;i1d,, A 4
ha]f_  V '

“We had a couple minor, correctable
mistakes”. The coaches addressed» that at
halftime,” Jenkins said. “We fixed that

and obviously it worked in the“ secqiid,

half.”

Just like the game a week earlier
against Houston, the Pitt defense contin-
ued to make big plays when it needed
them most. Kasperowicz intercepted a
Clement pass midway through the third

- quarter. He returned the ball to  ter-

ritory, but the offense was unableto capi-
talize, bungling another field goal

attempt.

On the ensuing Hurricane drive,
Curtis McGhee came up with yet another
turnover for the Panthers, forcing a fum-
ble by Dyral McMillan. The offense
made good on this opportunity. Pete
Gonzalez scrambled 12 yards into the end
zone, giving Pitt a 21-14 lead going into
the fourth quarter.

Miami’s offense came on the field to
open the fourth and held the ball for 4: 14,
the longest drive of the game by either
team. The Panthers’ bend—but-don’t-
break defense gave up only a 35-yard
Andy Crosland field goal, and Pitt still
led 21-17. 2

The teams traded punts, then Pitt’s
offense came back. Still seeing virtually
no pressure from the Hurricane front,

"Gonzalez and Schulters got Pitt down to

Miarni’s 10-yard—line with 3:30 to go in

the game. With achance to score and give 1
Pitt a nearly-insurmountable 11-point

lead, Schulters fumbled.

I “We should have ﬁnished that drive

off. That fumble reminds us that we’re

not quite where we need to be yet,” Harris

said, ‘,‘We, want to keep getting better.”
.With one final chance at winning,

 jdrove efficiently downfield, even

though Pitt’s front seven had consistent
pressure on Clement.

Using the sidelines and their time-
outs, the Huriicanes got to Pitt’s 34-yard
line. On fourth down, Pitt’s defense had
the biggest play of them all, an intercep-
tion by John Jenkins. Gonzalez took a
knee on three more plays to run out the
remaining 1:12 on the clock

“In the pre—game, I was ready to
play, ready to play hard,” said Ford.
“I’ve been working hard and learn-
ing and I’m at an advantage coming
off the bench because I can watch
Mandy [Wittenmyer] and Celeste
[Barkley] and learn from them.”

The Panthers came out strong in
the second half, particularly on
defense, not ‘allowing a Shelen
point until more than three minutes
had elapsed in the period.

“We came out very aggressive,
something we didn’t do at first,”
Waites said.

Solid second half performances
from Stewart, Laine Selwyn, and
Bettina Love helped Pitt break the
game wide open, going up by as
many as 34 points. After hitting just
one of her six field goal attempts in
the first half, Stewart exploded to
finish hitting 6—of-15 including
one—third of her three-point
attempts.

“The difference was

slowed down, concentrated, and
took my time shooting,
said.

Pitt outscored Shelen, 48-28, in

3!

Stewart

the second half to easily claim the
89-60 victory. It was a team effort
as every player in the Panther line-
up scored at least four points.

Stewart led the Panthers with a
game-high 19 points, while three
other players recorded 11. Love had
a solid night all around, finishing
with 11 points, six assists, three
blocks, and two steals. Selwyn also
had 11 points and six assists and in
addition, picked up six steals. Ford,
who played only her second game
in a Panther uniform, finished with
11 points, a block and .a steal.

On the other side, Shelen was
led by Erchova, who finished with

. 17 points and five assists. The only

other Shelen player to score more
than 10 was Kolosovakaia, who had
11 points and three assists on the
night.

Overall, Waites was very
pleased with her team, particularly
the fact that they outrebounded
Shelen, played a transitional
defense, and boxed out.

“The exhibitions are over now,
they did what we asked and now we
just have to fine tune,” Waites said.

The Panthers will open the reg-
ular season on Nov. 18 when they
host Sacred Heart.
