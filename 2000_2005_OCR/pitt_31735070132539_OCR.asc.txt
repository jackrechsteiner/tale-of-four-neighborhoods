Hundreds ﬂood Oakland — in rain — to protest war

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

With signs reading, “Behind every Bush is a
terrorist” and “Like a Rock, only Dumber,” those
in opposition to the United States’ presence in
Iraq marchedthrough Oakland to protest the one-
year anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq.

The march was part of a series of weekend
events organized by the Thomas Merton Center
to support bringing an end to the U.S. occupation
of Iraq. ‘

Hundreds gathered on Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park for a pre-march peace picnic amid
speeches and pouring rain to protest the policies
of President George W. Bush. ‘

Felix AuYeung, a graduate student at Pitt,
held up a sign reading “Regime change begins at
home. Vote out Bush/Cheney” and expressed his
opposition to the administration’s policies.

“[Bush has] turned back the clock on a lot of
progress,” said AuYeung, who also disagrees
with what he sees as the unilateral decision of the
United States to invade Iraq.

“It was against international law,” he said.

“And if we don’t follow the law, we can’t expect _

other countries to do so either.”

Some protesters came to the picnic in cos-
tume to lend their support to the anti-war protest.
Jabari, a self-described gorilla, expressed his
opposition to the United States presence in Iraq.

“War no good. I like people.” Jabari said.

A small group of people supporting the war
and the Bush administration also came to

Flagstaff Hill, carrying signs like “Make love
after war” and “Gave peace a chance.”

Julia Cowher, a freshman at North Allegheny
High School, felt that those protesting did not
understand the situation insIraq. '

“I feel that it’s ignorant. That they don’t
know what they are talking about,” Cowher said,
adding that the Iraqi people are better off now
than a year ago. —

“They can listen to the
music they want, and all the
other things they want to do,”

she said. “They were ’ ~ ’
oppressed, and now they are f0ll0W_ the la“):
free.” ’

The picnic concluded with
speakers urging the crowd to
action. Matt Balotta, a junior
at Pitt and a member of the
anti—war committee of the
Thomas Merton Center, spoke
to the crowd. ’

“Not one more lie. Not one
more day. Not one more death. ‘\

Let’s march,” Balotta said.

More than 1,000 people marched through
Oakland, chanting, “Drop Bush, not bombs,” and
“Show me what democracy looks like. This is
what democracy looks like.” "

Although there was a large police presence,
Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney asserted that the
police were there for the safety of the protesters,
as well as to make -sure the march stayed on
track.

“If we don ’t

we can ’t expect
other countries
to do so either ”

Feliz AuYeung
Pitt graduate student and protester

“We needed more vehicles to block off the
streets _so that nobody gets hurt,” Delaney said.
He stressed that a successful march means’com—
munication between the organizers and the

' police,

“Right away we make sure to communicate

with the organizers,” Delaney said. “We’re all on‘

the same channel.”

' The march culminated with a rally

outside the William Pitt Union, where

more speeches were made on behalf of

some of the endorsers of the event.
Neal Bisno spoke on behalf of the

, District 1l99P/SEIU about the war
being about the common man.

“The war in Iraq is a working
class issue,” he said. “The war in Iraq
is a union issue.” i’ _

After the rally, many continued to
Carnegie Mellon University’s student
union to protest what they see as a
connection between the University
and the United States military.

They staged a sit-in inside the‘

union, where students used a megaphone to share
their thoughts with those listening.

Daniel Papasian, a sophomore at CMU,
changed his major from engineering after learn-
ing that many consider jobs with defense con-
tractors thatdeal with CMU as good jobs.

“Is making weapons that kill children a good
job?” Papasianrasked those in attendance. “Then
I want to be unemployed.” r

No legacy perks for Pitt

students, admissions says

ERIN CLARKE
&aﬁVWﬂer’

A prospective Pitt student fills
out an application. Question No. 7
reads “Family Members Who Are
Pitt Alumni.” She wonders: If her
parents were Pitt alumni, would she
automatically be accepted?

Forstudents applying to Texas
A&M _University, this was the case
until Jan. 9,2004. Students with
alumni parents were guaranteed
admission.

University President Robert
Gates dropped the program because
it was targeted as being’ a racially
discriminative practice, as it granted

admissions preference to family

members of university alumni. ’

At a school that began integrat-
ing during the mid-40s, like Texas
A&M, minority legacy students rep-
resent a small percentage.

While other public universities,
such.as the University of Georgia,
have eliminated their legacy poli-
cies, a number of institutions still

. have similar programs. Most ask on

their applications whether a family
member of the applicant attendedthe.

Pitt, Duquesne University and

Admissions faculty’ from each
school said that the schools do not

have legacy policies, but they

explained that there are other reasons
— primarily, scholarships — for the
question.

Carlow College includes on their
admissions application the statement
“The Alumnae Legacy Scholarship is
available to those who qualify,’-’ let-

ting prospective students know why,

they are asked to list relationships to
those who attend or are alunmi of the
college.

According to Betsy Porter, direc-
tor of admissions at Pitt, a legacy
policy has never been used.) The
question is used instead to reach out
to prospective students, she said.

The University has “astrong

Conference tackles gender equality

LAURA JERP1
Stafflﬁhiter

Even though Title IX of the
Education Amendment was intro-
duced in 1972 to stop sexual dis-
crimination in federally funded
education programs and activities,
experts are beginning to wonder if
this protection has recently begun
to fall.short.

Verna L. Williams, a professor
at the University of Cincinnati
College of Law, gave a speech titled
“Single-Sex Education: Reform or
Retrenchment,” on Friday as part of
a two-day conference called, “Title
IX and Gender Equity in Education:
The Unfinished Agenda.” ‘

Williams’ areas of interest
include gender and the law, critical
race theory, family law, and chil-

dren and the law.
Her latest-publication, “Reform _

or Retrenchment? Single-Sex
Education and the Construction of
Race and Gender,” was in the

V Wisconsin Law Review.

Williams said single-sex educa-
tion is one of the most complicated
issues she has studied.

“I find the focus on single-sex
education a bit unsettling,”
Williams said. _

city schools are the central focus of
the debate on single-sex education.

One of the main concerns about
segregating boys and girls in
schools is that it could further high-
light the differences between femi-
ninity and masculinity.

Since women often head inner-
city families, all-boy schools tend
to focus on teaching them how to be
men. 2

They learn skills such as how to
provide for their families. Much of
the focus of these schools is teach-
ing the boys discipline.

One of the main focuses of all-
girl schools in inner cities is pre-
venting pregnancy.

Williams believes this construes
femininity as irresponsible, and
implies a strong necessity to control
female sexuality.

She believes it also sends girls
the message that they can only be
scholars when boys are not around.
Williams does not agree with this.

The curriculum of these schools
is often shaped to fit the gender of
the students. While girls in one
school are reading “Pride and
Prejudice,” the boys are reading
“All Quiet on the Western Front.”

Single-sex schools often place

streets and narrow alleyways, and the
sttmning Arabic architecture reinforces
the old-world vibe. Mystical sights,
sounds and smells abound: ancient carved
doors, bustling market scenes, Muslim
women clad inblack and the call to prayer
projected over loudspeakers throughout
the town all swirl around in a mystical
feast for the senses.

Switched Majority

As the ship set sail for India, it was
clear that Africa made a lasting impres-
sion on the Semester at Sea community.
For the black students on the ship, Africa
functioned as a sort of homecoming, a
place, where, for the ﬁrst time, the minor-
ity became the majority. Conversely, there
were a lot of freaked-out white kids who
suddenly found themselves representing
“the others.”

“It was really comfortable,” said
Brittainy Donnell, a black sophomore
from Pitt. “For me, it felt like I belonged.
But for a lot of white kids on the ship, it
was their ﬁrst time being in the minority.”

“They ﬁnally realized what it felt like
to be us (ir1 America),” she added.

Racial Issues Tackled
The range of emotions circulating on

the S.S; Universe Explorer found expres-

sion in an evening community forum, in
which on-board students of African

descent talked frankly about racial issues

and ﬁelded questions and comments.
Attendance was completely voluntary, but
there was a hardly a seat to be found in the
ship’s union. '

The forum ran an enthusiastic hour
over schedule, giving rise to a varied mix
of emotions from both the audience and
the participants: expressions of guilt,
shame, pride and confusion. Topics like
afﬁrrnative action, the role of the minori-
ty media, white privilege and interracial
relationships were covered. While the
mood remained serious throughout the
discussion, it steered clear of direct con-
frontation and was interspersed with
humorous moments, hearty bouts of

laughter and touching personal anecdotes.

“The people on this hip all shed light
into this one world, which is like a prism,”
said Sara Young, a junior ﬁom Marist
College. “Through the prism is omitted a
myriad of colors. Everyone on this panel
is a rainbow of colors, along with every-
one in this room.” - _

Val Whitaker, a junior from Pitt and a
panelist in the forum who considered the
event a successful starting point for future

discussions, believedrthat it opened “a I I

Pandora’s box of understanding.”

“I don’t care if people got negative or
positive impressions,” he said. ‘The point
is that we got the whole ship talking.” He
added that the forum might have shed
some light on an extremely pressing issue:
the lack of diversity on Semester at Sea.

Of the more than 650 students on the
S.S. Universe Explorer, only 13 —— or
about 2 percent — are black, according to
Whitaker. The organization of the forum
was a stepin the right direction, he added.

“Hopefully, the administration got the
idea,” he said. He said he believes that the
shipboard community could be made
more diverse by the Institute for
Shipboard Education, if it granted more
ﬁnancial aid to minorities and marketed
the program to a broader selection of col-
leges and universities. V

As the discussion carried on into the
night, few people were paying attention to
a previously crowded area of the union:
the grade wall. In the day, following the
second global studies test, students
crowded around the wall to match their
social security numbers with their posted
grades — grades that would determine 20
percent of their final letters in the class.
Nary a soul stood searching for his num-
ber during the panel discussion.

For at least ‘two hours, learning
seemed more important than grades. '

national alumni associations.

Porter explained that, although
having an alumnus parent is not a
significant factor, building on a fam-
ily tradition is important to Pitt.

”There is an effort made to reach

‘ out and let [children of alumni] know

that Pitt is very interested in them,”
she said. Each year, between 250 and

300 students enrolling in the fresh- '

man class have Pitt alumni parents.
-Having a family member who

went to Pitt “could [only] play a role

in a borderline situation.” Porter

said. Her comment was an echo of -

that given by a Duquesne University
admissions faculty member.

The deciding factors for admis-
sion into Pitt are a high school tran-
script — proving that student chal-
lenged himself or herself; high SAT
and/or ACT scores; the written appli-
cation; and the application fee.

“There is an element of presenta-
tion,” Porter said, indicating that

University, she explained.

The choice to ignore whether
applicants have alumni family~mem—
bers has not affected University and
alumni relationships, Porter said.

In the Office of Institutional
Advancement, which raises money
from alumni, Rita Momchilovich
believes that a legacy policy makes
no difference to alumni who want to

alumni know that they are appreciat- ed in certain programs and they had a

little ‘emphasis on intellectual skills
that will get students far in life.
There are typically no Advanced
Placement classes offered in these
schools.

Williams believes that these
schools should spend more time
exposing and preparing students for
career options that they can_pursue.

Williams said that in the past,
black boys and girls were basically
treated the same from the time they
were children. ' -I

’ A common assumption was that
sex segregation could help these
‘children assimilate into normal
male and female culture.

“Single-sex education prepared
blacks to take the constrained roles

available to them,” she said.

There was once a common
belief that the nature and delicacy
of women shows that they belong in
the home, she said. '

They were also told that too

much thinking diverted blood from

the womb to the brain. This is why
women could not go to school with
men.

Williams believes that teachers
should be educated'to‘ treat their
students equally, eventually making
single-sex schools would become
unnecessary.

Center. The world community sees
America’s war on terrorism in a

Iraq was a good idea. Turkey,

world.

In France and Germany, majori-
ties believe that the United States is
conducting the war on terrorism to
control oil and dominate the world.
People in Muslim nations, who also
see helping Israel and targeting

was a compelling reason to mobilize
troops. Regardless, at this point, the
word “quagmire” is becoming more
and more appropriate. We lack a
clear plan or exit strategy, and sol-
diers die every day. The rest of the
world is right to question us on this.

We have isolated ourselvesin a
world that is ever—shrinking. We
ﬂouted the United Nations in get-
ting involved in Iraq, which would
have been fine —_if we had been
right, if we had had a victory that, in
addition to being quick, was clean
and decisive. That hasn’t happened.
The American presence is ﬂounder-
ing, and American corporations are
making out best.

World opinion is a useful
barometer, a way for us to step back
and see our actions from a new per-
spective. Right now, the world is
looking at the mess America has
made of things, and is rightly asking
what we plan to do to clean it up.

Dear Sex N’at,
I have a question about something that I
have always been told. I was raised to
believe that every girl is looking for a, nice
guy. I always believed that was bull but
never realized just how much until recently.
A couple weeks back I was in a ﬁght and it
gotpretty messy. I’m notproud of whathap-
pened but I especially don’t know how to
respond to the attention I recently have been
getting. My question is, why
would a girl exert so much more
eﬁort in me after this incident? I
really could care less about these a
girls because they’re obviously

Because, you know, that kind of element of

I wish I knew a little bit more about the

think if it were to avenge the honor of some ’

homely, sad girl who’d been getting picked
on and was crying, you’d tell me and it
might make a little more sense for the ladies
to start a-ﬂockin’.

So, going on the assumption that it was
a dumb ﬁght for dumb reasons, why are cer-
tain ladies noticing you more?

I’m going to agree with you that these
particular ladies may be unique among
women, i.e., that their intentions  be a bit
less ‘than honorable. Personally, I detest
ﬁghting, and whoever raised you to believe
that every girl wants a nice guy is probably

THE PITT NEWS V

When someone diesin the Jewish
faith, the immediate family spends one
week sitting shiva. Shiva involves not
leaving the house while friends and fam-
ily come over to cook, clean, and ‘assist
‘in assorted household tasks. Every night
during the period of mourning, more
friends and family show up at the house

_ to pay their respects and take part in a

brief religious service known as a
minyan. .

Sitting shiva is almost never a fes-
tive event. There’s usually a general air
of solemnity about the whole thing, as
well there should be. Many people who
pay shiva calls and ,aren’t especially
close with the family of the deceased
only show up to pay their respects
because there exists a feeling of obliga-

2 tion, be it personal or professional.

,Much like -attending ' a funeral, it
isn’t the kind of thing anyone, really
looks forward to, simply because it can
be such a depressing experience.
However, having both sat shiva and
attended it at the homes of others in the
last few months, I’ve found that death is
only as depressing as you want it to be.
I realized this ‘because every time I
attend one of these gatherings, ‘I always
leave feeling better about myself -and
about life than I did when I arrived.

' A few weeks ago, a close family

— friend, a man I’ve known my entire life,

lost his mother. I went to ‘his house to
attend shiva. After the ser-
vice, when most of the
guests had left, I was hang-
ing around the kitchen while
my mom and some other
friends were packing up the
leftover food. My friend and
I sat at the table discussing
draft strategies for the New
York Jets.

stipulates that a visitor in a’
house of mourning should

your brother covered his
bedroom walls in peanut
butter. Why? Because
everyone deals with death,
and it’s more productive to
celebrate a life than to sim-
_ply mourn a death. Death is
a part of life.

Last November, my
grandfather passed away on
the day I turned 21. From
one standpoint, I.could very

 

never take anything with
them when they._leave, but
when I left the house that evening, my
friend had bestowed upon me an entire
chocolate cake, a cherry pie, "a bag of
pastries and a bottle of vodka.
_ “We have all these leftovers,” his
wife said. “You’ve got to take some of
this stuff!” A -

~ Oddly enough, that seems to be the
norm. Everyone seems to leave what
should be sad events feeling good about
a conversation they just had with a
friend or relative, or, at the very least,

Death. itself is -sad. The idea of
someone close to you not being around
anymore can be extremely upsetting,
and it usually is. But death is very much

easily have dismissed it as
being the worst birthday I’d
ever had. In fact, it was without question
the worst; I just choose not to think of it
like that. - j
My grandfather was a truly wonder-
ful man who redefmed living life to its
fullest. He didn’t embark on extravagant
journeys; he didn’t attempt outlandish
stunts; he didn’t even do anything spon-
taneous. A terrible misconception exists
that living life to its fullest involves
never sitting still. He just played golf,
ate and told jokes. That was hislife —
and he loved every minute of it.
He struggled with various health

‘problems his entire life, having been

born blind in one eye and deaf in one

ear. He suffered from hypertension and _

emphysema; he survived three angio-

Rituals of death and mourning are life—affirming

plasties, quadrup1e—bypass surgery and a
stroke. Through all of it, he never
stopped playing golf, enjoying food "or
laughing at the outlandish- things he
said. The man seemed to enjoy all but
his last six weeks, when the cancer real-
ly got to him. 2

. , Losing him was terrible, and the
fact that it happened on my birthday ini-
tially made it just a little more difﬁcult.
But between his death and the funeral, I
decided that the conclusion was
inevitable, but the timing may well have
been a gift; I’ll forever associate my
birthday with my grandfather.

I .moumed his passing and I still
miss him very much, but I didn’t allow
myself to be too upset for very long.
Death is a part of life. To stay upset over
it would not only have impeded my
progress, it would have been selﬁsh and
contradictory to the very way my grand-
father carried himself from day to day.

Every year, rather than a painful
reminder of the suffering he endured,
can serve as an opportunity for me to put
my life into perspective, remember him,‘
and attempt to recapture some of his
attitude and his outlook, that I might be
a better person for it.

and I don’t want anything to undermine my centrist
street-cred.

I’m a moderate, all right, but not really by choice. I

Spiher makes in her colurrm, I believe that she is this
latter style of liberal, but it would be presumptuous of
me to state it outright, seeing as I don’t know her and
have never taken the time to ask about her politics.
That’s a mistake only irresponsible journalists make.

I have no sympathy for Spiher’s idea of the liberal
victim. She closes her column in false fairness: “To be
fair, liberal commentators occasionally use these tech-
niques as well. Unfortunately, they can’t seem to use
them as effectively.” Democrats, apparently, would like
to be as cold and calculating as Republicans, but it’s
just not in their George-Washington—as-a-young—lad

ders and goofy smile).

Spiher’s much-trumpeted we’re—right—about—every—
thing, you-guys-are—wrong-about—everything mindset
is as naive as it is tired. She sees a danger in confusing
a well—formed idea with a well—written text. This is a
high irony, because I cannot think of a more perfectly

' accurate description of her column. Each point is made

with conﬁdence, presented with clarity and served up
with a huge chip on its shoulder. Yet each point is elo-
quently misguided. '

America, like the music industry,
is a battleﬁeld — only the strongest
survive. And Jucifer is looking to take
over both with their newest EP, War
Bird. It exposes emotions of fear,
pride and jadedness throughout the
songs.

The ﬁrst track on the EP, “Ideas of
Light,” features tense guitar riffs and
almost tribal drum beats. You feel as
though you are marching into war,
with the outcome doomed to be nega-
tive. Sporadically, the instruments
drop’ off, leaving Amber Va1entine’s
pained vocals resonating in your ears.

Considering that the first three
tracks start off with the same disso-
nant guitar chords, it is hard to really
appreciate the musicianship in the
beginning of the album. Following
“Ideas of Light” is “Day Breaks on the

Field of Battle.” The track is fully
instrumental and sounds like an exten-
sion of “Ideas of Light.” It is hard to
pick when one ends and the other
begins. ..

If cohesion between the songs is
what Jucifer was going for in the
beginning of the album, they were
successful. They fail to prove, howev-
er, that variety is the spice of life. It
would be interesting to hear a differ-
ence between tracks.

But if you begin to think all is lost,
listen to track four, titled “Haute
Couture.” It is more upbeat with a fun
drum rhythm that is unlike any past
attempts from Jucifer. ‘-‘The Shape of
Texas” follows “Haute Couture” with
a completely different style. Valentine
begins to sing in a haunting and
somber tone, and the song picks up
speed soon after.

The track “My Stars” proves the

listener completely wrong if they _

think that War Bird may be monoto-
nous. This song is country, through

and through. There is a plucky guitar

with Valentine singing a tale about
growing up inAmerica. And when you
expect there to be some sort of heavy-

metal breakdown deep within the
song, you hear only folk lyrics and
that "plucky guitar.

War Bird is a battle against the

ordinary, leaving the listener rooting
for the creative intensity of Jucifer to
beat out uniformity.

She’s undoubtedly talented and rather

unlike most artists who incorporate autobi-

sings ﬁction.

She does this through the life of
Georgette, the protagonist of Quick’s latest

Georgette is a rocker who has faced

just how much of the story sheis telling.

“Bigger,” in which ﬂie only lyrics are “You
are notthe next big thing/You are not the
next big thing/You are not the next big
thing, but I thought for a.second that you
were.”

If Georgette is the protagonist of the
album, then angst is its antagonist.

The listener starts to question Quick’s
inspirations. Is she singing about a broken
heart? Perhaps a failed relationship?

But, regardless of questioning whether
or not Quick’s songs are completely fabri-
cated stories of her own life or others, there
is no questioning when it comes to analyz-
ing her feelings. She does this by unveiling

the darker side of her character. And there is

no questioning that Quick has grown up
since her days with her former band
Stickman Jones. She wears her heart on her
sleeve on this sophomore album.

Intense lyrics make for a hauntingly
truthful tale of a broken heart But even
though Quick’s lyrics come from the pen of
a woman who is quite talented at her art,
there is, ultimately, not enough’ variety in
her stories.

House’s current Prospectus Two
exhibit, like this piece, as explo-
rations of identity. “My work is the
self—examination of cultural identity,”
she writes in her artist statement. “I
started to analyze identity as a more
general social institution, crossing
boundaries of religion, gender, and
sex. My iconography is an amalgam

of Native culture and Western reli-

gion.”
“Mary Crow Dog” is representa-

‘ tive of Hanemann’s works. In each of

her lithographs or mono-prints, there
is a deep examination of female,
Native American and Christian iden-
tities to show the complexity of one’s

existence and explore the implica-

tions of being not just one thing, but
all of these things at once.

These interesting tensions are
created, in part, through Hanemann’s
appropriation of religious iconogra-
phy from famous Italian Renaissance

works_ with Native American sym- —

bols. By placing pieces of such long
venerated and studied works beside
contemporary, Native American sym-
bols, Hanemann compounds their tra-
ditions to form a completely new
association. Each of her many pieces
creates complex, yet accessible, iden-
tity questions in minimal but.power-
ful, compositions.

In contrast, the prints by Keith
Dull, the second contributor to
Prospectus Two, are all alive with
detail, but. seem to carry less weight
than Hanemann’s. “My imagery is
designed to draw ‘cultural compar-
isons between the past and present,”

.Dull writes in his artist statement. He

wants to re-infuse the print medium
with the force and inﬂuence of pre-
Renaissance times, he _ says. And
while this is an exciting idea, it’s dif-
ficult to find where or even if Dull
achieves this goal. His works are
thought—provoking in their decorative
and abstract qualities, but give few
clues to let you in on their meanings,
and therefore, the depth which Dull
proscribes to them.

For example, in his “Sylvan
Witan” series, which’he says deals
with “imagery relating to the tradi-
tions and beliefs of negotiations
along the Pennsylvania frontier dur-
ing the eighteenth century,” his sym-
bolism is mostly inaccessible. In each
work of this eight—canvas series, a
central print figure is surrounded bya
bright, even iridescent, field of paint,
and stands within a geometrically
decorated border that is — nearly as
thick as the space allotted for the fig-
ure. In some cases, the border con-
tains strips of shiny fabric or glitter to

match the color scheme of the partic-
ular canvas. However, there is little
to suggest the historic meaning that
Dull attributes to the series.

Similar things could be said of
his “Vanir” relief series. Each of the

I four canvases has a playing card-like

composition of a heroic figure encir-
cled by bright, curving fields of
color. Each figure stands above
squared—off spaces which contain

-empty speech bubbles like in a comic

strip. His bright and expressive col-
ors, comic-strip-like composition,
and the raised, “bumpy” surfaces,
harken to works by artists like Roy
Lichtenstein, and are nearly as excit-
ing and entertaining to view.
Unfortunately, Dull’s prints lack a
corresponding profundity.

However, that is not to discard
them. Dull’s works are like a “Mary
Crow Dog’.’ in their own way. They
appear as geometric decoration, fig-
ural print and abstract symbol all at
once. Each aspect plays off another to
create compositions that are, indeed,
unique and perplexing. The amalga-
mation of his compositions, and of
Elizabeth Hanemann’s works, is

‘worth a thorough consideration —

whether or not their visions, are fully
realized. I 5

Off the wire: An old New Kid on the Block looks to the future

LAURA KENNEDY
The Diamondback (U. Maryland)

(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md. —
Life’s different now for Jordan Knight.
He’ll be 34 in May, a far cry from the
barely post—pubescent singer who
fronted New Kids on the Block in the
late 1980s and early 1990s. While he
still lives in Boston, where the New
Kids got their start, he mostly func-
tions outside the celebrity ﬁshbowl.
And on his current tour, instead" of
playing for packed stadiums, Knight’s

age capacity of around 1,000 —-
including Baltimore’s Funk Box next

Tuesday.

Needless to_ say, a lot has changed
in the 15 years since the New Kids
released their breakout album, Hangin ’
Tough.

_ Well, except for the screaming.

“The audience is pretty much 95
percent female-based, and it’s the same
reaction, a lot of screamin’ and yellin’
and hootin’ and hollerin’,” said Knight,
in his laid—back Boston accent. He’s on
his cell phone on the road to his next
show in Albany, N.Y. “It’s funny. It
happens everywhere. It happened on
the ﬂight into New York — girls, in
front of me in the seats were peering
through the seats and pointing at me;

 LIVING Le...  

we were on the streets in Manhattan,
the same thing. You get used to it.”
And what about that voice — “the
voice that touched millions,” accord-
ingto a promo on his Web site? Can a
guy in his 30s really still hit the high
notes in “Please Don’t Go Girl?”
“You better believe it,” Knight

, said, laughing. “You never lose that.

Actually, I. think it’s gotten better with
time, I really do.”

And that’s why he’s releasing

washed memories and give the, ahem,
classic tunes -— from “Cover Girl” to
“Step by Step” —.a more up—to—date
sound.

“The vocal arrangements are pretty
much the same; it’s just the music has
changed,” said Knight, who sings
tunes from the New Kids’ repertoire,
his first album and his upcoming sec-
ond record at his shows. “If- you were
to take ‘Step by Step’ and you were to
produce it today, ‘ this is the way it
would sound because it sounded like
1990. It definitely sounds very
2004, you know with the Neptunes
sound and that type of thing. It’s hook
music.”

The remix album will mark an

anniversary of sorts. It’s been just
under a decade since the New Kids on
the Block — later known as NKOTB
— broke up, ending the blockbuster
run of ﬁve guys who launched a living,
breathing, cheesy—dance-move-pop-
ping, merchandising juggernaut whose
legend lives on in the Britney Spears
dolls that line toy store shelves.

“With the New Kids, we were one

0 of a kind,” he said of the late-rni1lenni-

um pop music reﬂux. “There really
wasn’t a term ‘boy band’ when we
were out, so I think what happened in
the late 90s is that it got way out of
control. The gravy train just started to

‘get way out of control, and every label,

had to have a Backstreet Boys, and
that’s why only a few of the groups had
that success. Because once you over-
saturate the market, forget about it. It’s
just too much. Too much and too little
time, you know?”

Around the samertime Backstreet
and its ilk held court at the top of the
charts, ‘Knight and fellow New Kids-

’. , heartthrob ’Joey McIntyre — whom

Knight said he called about an hour
before this interview —- saw some solo
success. Now Knight’s looking for a
late May or early June release for his
follow-up to l999’s Jordan Knight.
Like every spinoff of- a successful

_ pop group, Knight repeated several

times the importance of staying true to
himself. He said he never thought of
leaving the entertainment business to

-go into something like "real estate

development, like his brother and fel-
low New Kid Jonathan Knight did. But
he also acknowledged that the industry
to which he’s dedicated his life is a
business, and every move has to be

well thought—out something his
younger peers haven’t always accom-
plished.

“I think Nick Carter’s failure as a
solo artist shows right there that he
didn’t. take the time to find the right
producers and the right music,” Knight

said of the Backstreet Boy—turned- ‘

Paris Hilton boy toy. “Hewas Nick
Carter, the baby heartthrob from the
Backstreet Boys, and all of a sudden

he comes off "and he wants to be

Aerosmith with his solo record. People
aren’t going to buy that! All of a sud-
den Nick’s got piercings and com-
rows? That’s why Justin [Timberlake]
had success. He didn’t stray too far
from the» _*NSYNC sound.
Everybody thought Nick Carter was
gonna blow up with that, and all he did
was blow up with weight. Have’ you
seen him lately? You can’t even see
Paris Hilton!” ,

Despite his affinity for his inde-
pendence as a solo artist and for the
smaller venues he performs in now,
Knight said he’ll always be proud of
his time as a New Kid.

“I don’t know why anyone would
want to distance themselves from
something that was that successful,”
Knight said. “When you still hold
attendance records to this day, that’s
something to be proud of. Plus all the
top 20 hits that the group had, and all
the people who had such great fond
memories and to this day hold those
memories pretty near and dear to their
hearts. You come to the shows now
and you get a chance to talk to those
people and they tell you what an
impact your music had on their lives,
or their childhood, or got them through
a bad time in their life. How can some-
body want to distance themselves from
something that incredible?”

Panthers beat Badgers and

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

MILWAUKEE —— Fighting a heavily
VV1sconsin Badgers—favoring crowd, the Pit
men’s basketball team was able to use time-
ly rebounds, steals and converted free
throws to stage a late comeback

Pitt defeated the Badgers, 59-55, to
advance to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tour-
nament before a sellout crowd at the Bradley
Center in Milwaukee.

Despite being seeded lower than Pitt, at
No. 6, VV1sconsin (25-7) essentially played a
home game, since its home court is approx-
imately an hour away ﬁom Milwaukee.

But the No. 3-seeded Panthers did not
allow the deafening crowd to spoil their
comeback

“We knew coming into the tournament
that we would be playing on the road,” for-
ward Jaron Brown said. “We just stuck
together.”

Pitt (31-4) out—rebounded the Badgers,
40-31, in the game, while knocking down
seven out of nine foul shots from the charity
stripe down the stretch. The Panthers came
up with seven steals, compared to
W1sconsin’s four.

“[Rebounding] is a big strength of
ours,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said.
“Our guards rebotmded well; it was a great
team effort”

With 5:46 left in the game, VV1sconsin
guard Clayton Hanson nailed a three-pointer
to put the Badgers ahead 48-44. After

Hanson’s basket, the Panthers went on to
ﬁnish the game on a 15-7 run.

The run began on a missed jump shot
by Pitt guard Julius Page, but Panﬂrer center

_ Chris Taft was able to grab the rebound and

_slam—d1mk the ball to bring the Panﬂrers
within two. Page, who ﬁnished with 12
points and two steals, followed with a steal
on the ensuing possession and threw down a
wide—open dunk to tie the game at 48.

“We were not just going to break down
because we were behind,” Page said. “I
think they ran the same play three times, and
I anticipated.”

On Pitt’s next possession, forward
Chevon Troutman, who brought down 14
rebounds, made a layup and was fouled to
give Pitt a 50-48 lead Troutman then made
his free throw, which gave the Panthers a
three—point advantage. " I

On the ensuing possession, VV1sconsin
guard Boo Wade was fouled by Pitt guard
Carl Krauser and made both shots, which
made the score 51-50.

Krauser, Pitt’s leading scorer with 16
points, went to the foul line on Pitt’s next
possession, but he only converted one of his
two free throws, giving the Panthers a two-
point margin at 52-50.

Badger forward Mike Wﬂldnson was
the next contestant at the free-throw line and
knotted the game at 52 by converting both
free throws. With four fouls, Krauser drove
toward the basket and nailed a ﬁeld goal to

MILWAUKEE — One simple theft was all
Pitt needed to steal a win from Wisconsin
and advance tothe Sweet 16 for the third
consecutive: year.

With just more than ﬁve minutes
remaining in the game, the Badgers held a
two-pointlead and the ball. Devin Hanis
led Wisconsin down the ﬂoor, looked to his
left, and sent a pass in the direction of B00
Wade.

But Wade never got the ball.

and took off down the court with the ball,

possessions before, and I knew they were
going to pass it to my guy,” Page ‘said.
‘The last time, my guy stood and waited
for the pass to come to him. I knew it
would be there and I recognized the setup.
I knew he didn’t work too hard [to get ﬂre
pass].”

The dunk accounted for two of Page’s
12 points — his highest point total since
scoring 14in Pitt’s Big East quarterﬁnal
game against Virginia Tech. E

Since ﬂrat game, Page’s struggles from
the ﬁeld have been obvious. In Pitt’s open-
ing round win over Central Florida on
Friday, the senior guard made just two of
his 12 shots from the ﬁeld and, many
times, the frustration was evident on his

ACC: Win some, lose more

Sure, they get major markets and a temporary
bump up, so they’re arguably the best all—around
conference in terms of major sports -——for the time
being. But it’s_oh so top-heavy. Florida State and
Miami who are going to duke it out -(no pun
intended) for the BCS bid every year, while the
other schools pour millions of dollars into pro-
grams that simply can’t compete. Basketball-
wise, they got weaker, with BC being the only
real asset (and not much of one by ACC stan-
dards)._ .

But beyond that, the biggest loss for the ACC
is the once-hallowed common ground of geo-
graphic and academic standing. There once was a
time when the ACC was composed of not just
great athletic schools, but great universities,
headed by the prestige of "Duke, UNC—Chapel Hill
and the University of Virginia. Add Florida State
and you lose some of the mystique. Add VaTech
and Miami and everyone forgets it was ever there.

Of course, the ACC and defectors see this dif-
ferently. They see success on all levels, athletical-
ly and economically. They see untold riches
brought in for all to share. They see money for
nothing and tricks for free. But the Big East has
learned a hardlesson about the price of compla-
cency. Soon, the ACC might be joining us in a
real school of hard knocks. '

Pitt 0VerC0 6S season—1ow
shootingpercentage in win

"f 3 JOE MARCHILENAVV
Sports Editor ‘

Only one word can beused to“

describe Pit_t’s 53-44’ win .over
Central Florida in the first around of

the NCAA Tournament on, Friday 9-

ugly.  - . , _ -,

The Panthers shotﬂya season—low
29.5 percent from the field, while
the Golden Knights ‘weren.’t_much
better, connecting on 30.8 percent _of
their field goals. The_ offensive futil-
ity was highlighted by a three—and—a-
half-minute stretch in the second
half during which both teams went
scoreless. ’

The win was the Panthers’ 30th ’

of the season — a school record —
and was Pitt’s -third consecutive
opening round win in the NCAA
Tournament. .

“We won tonight and obviously,
we’d like to shoot at a higher per-
centage,” _Pitt head coach Jamie
Dixon said. “Any time you can hold
a team to shooting 30 percent from
the field, you’ve got to be pretty
happy with your defense.”

Carl Krauser led all scorers with
20 points, including two second-half

three-pointers and five free throws

 

points‘ and also grabbed nine’;
rebounds.  ' -‘   =
For Pitt, Chevon Troutman

added 13 points — 11 in the ﬁrs,_i;_,g

half — despite fouling out and Chris‘

Taft grabbed 16 rebounds ,to help‘. A

Pitt hold the advantage on the

boards, 37-33. » ' . g.
“You never count onanybody

for 16 rebounds,” Dixon sai‘ of Taft.

.“He did a great job on ithegboards. I" 
think that was atbigy key to us taking

control in the second half.” A V

, It looked like Pitt did have con-
trol‘ of the game early in the second
half. But, despite holding. a six—point
lead in the opening moments of the

half, it looked as if the Panthers ,

might be making an earlyiexit from
the tournament. '

The Knights‘ scraped together a” 1

12-3 run over a seven-minute‘ stretch
in the second half to take _a three-

A point lead with 12:39 remaining in

the game. Central Florida was able
to get back into the game by taking

APitt’s big men out of the game, dou- _

ble—teaming Taft every time he

touched the ball and forcing
Troutman to the bench after he
picked up his third and fourth fouls
of the game. A

Central Florida did not allow a
field goal by any Pitt player other
than Krauser for the first 14:29 of
the second half.

But after Morentin scored to put
the Knights up by three with 10 min-
utes to go, both teams went cold
from the field. The teams combined
to miss 10 consecutive field goals
before Troutman scored his only
points of the second half on a fast-
break layup with 5:28 to play.

Further complicating things for
Pitt was that seniors Julius Page and
Jaron Brown combined to shoot just
two of 17 from the fieldand scored
only 13 points. Pitt connected on
just six of its 24 field goal attempts
in the second half, but converted on
better than 70 percent of its free
throws.

When it counted, Page was able
to step up and provide Pitt with the
lift it needed. With 2:24 left and the
Panthers clinging to a two—point

lead, Page took a pass from Krauser
on the right wing and drilled a three-
pointer to put Pitt up 43-38.

“I shot it, so obviously I was
confident,” said Page about taking
that shot. “The other shots that I
missed, I was a little anxious. I felt
good about my shot beforecoming
in; I just think I rushed some shots.
When I caught it, I just took my time
with the shot.”

Dixon was glad to see Page pull
up and .take the shot as well.

“I have every confidence in the
world that heis going to make that
shot and so does he,” he said.
“Obviously, it wasn’t one of our bet-
ter games offensively. We’d like to
make every shot, but sometimes tha
doesn’t happen.” ' ‘

Pitt was able to hold on from
there, making 10-of—l2 free throws
in the final minutes to advance to the
second round of the tournament.

“You don’t take anything for
granted; your emphasis. is on execut-
ing and thinking about what you
have to do,” Dixon said about play-
ing in a close game. “It was one of
those days where we didn’t shoot
our best.”

Panthers come together offensively at critical moment of game

Wisconsin, page 14

put the Panthers ahead 54-52.

“We needed that basket,” Krauser said
“I didn’t have any fear of picking up my ﬁfth
fo .”

Pitt followed with a defensive stand,
and Brown was sent to the fo11l line with 42
seconds left on the clock. Brown knocked
down both foul shots and put the Panthers
ahead 56-52.

Wade answered at the other end with a
basket from beyond the are to cut Pitfs lead
to one with 21 seconds left in the contest

Krauser was intentionally fouled and
was able to convert on both ﬁee throws,
which put Pitt ahead 58-55. Badger forward
Zach Morley missed a ﬁeld goal, and Pitt

was able to secure the defensive rebound.
Brown was fouled to stop the clock with
three seconds left and made his second free
throw.

The Panther defense forced Morley to
turn the ball over, securing the victory.

But it had been a different story in the
ﬁrst half of play. In the ﬁnal seven minutes of
the ﬁrst half, the Panthers were able to
extend their lead to four before Wisconsin
guard Devin Harris scored 12 of the
Badgers’ ﬁnal 17 points of the half.

“There were shots that I was hitting in
the ﬁrst half that were not falling in the sec-
ond half,” Harris said

VV1th the Panthers leading 15-14, Harris
scored a bucket, which he followed with a
ﬁeld goal ﬁom downtown on W1sconsir1’s

next possession, giving them a 17-16 lead.’

A basket from Page allowed’ Pitt to
regain the lead at 18-17, but the Badgers put
four unanswered points on the scoreboard
with both Harris and Wilkinson going 2-for-
2 from the foul line, which gave them a 20-
17 lead - -

Troutrnan was able to slice the deﬁcit to
one with a layup. Krauser put Pitt back on

topafterBrowncameupwithastealonthe-

Badgers’ next possession. After a missed
shot, the ball was deﬂected to the top of the
key to Page during the scramble for the
rebound. The Panther lead moved up to three
after Krauser hit two of two ﬁee throws.
With the score 23-20 in favor of Pitt,
Morley was only able to make one of two
shots from the charity stripe. Page put Pitt up

26-21 with a three pointer with 1:28 left in
the ﬁrst half.

As quickly as the Panthers jumped in
front, they found themselves tied with
Wisconsin at half time. Wilkinson came up
with a steal, which Harris converted into a
lay up. Hanis followed on the Badgers’ next

possession with a three-pointer as the half‘

expired to knot the game at 26.

. Hanis, the game’s leading scorer with
21 points, scored 15 ﬁrst-half points, but
only scored six in the second half, as he was

defended by Brown for the bulk of the ﬁnal ‘

half.

“I-Ie’s a good player, but I wanted to
force him to take tough shots,” Brown said.
“Actually, I was wearing down because he
was running aroun ”

Julius Page nowhere near ready to go home, neither are Panthers

Page, page 14

‘ face.

While he was just ﬁve-of-15 from the
ﬁeld against VV1sconsin, Page was more
aggressive with the ball, driving down the
lane rather than settling for jump shots, as
he has for most of the season.

“I know when I get toward the basket,
there are not a lot of guys that can block my

shot,” he said, stating one reason why it p

was important to get down the lane. “I’m
just trying to be aggressive and, hopefully,

I’ll just get some calls and get to the [free

throw] line rather than relying on my
threes.” '

Although Page was unable to get to the
line, his ability to penetrate led to a couple

of open looks, -not only for himself, but for
other Panthers as well. After being
outscored in the paint against Central
Florida, Pitt dominated inside, outscoring
VV1sconsin, 32-12.

At first, it looked like Page would con-
tinue to struggle after missing his ﬁrst four
shots, and he ended the half with just four
points. But there were other reasons that he
was having a hard time shooting.

“I was so tired from trying to guard
[Harris] and score,” Page said about
Wisconsin’s leading scorer, who had 21
points, but none in the ﬁnal 12 minutes of
the game. “Jaron [Brown] and I switched
 hetiredmeoutintheﬁrsthalf. Hemade
a lot of tough shots.”

While Pagexwas unsure how much the
switch affected VV1sconsin’s guard, Hanis
noticed the difference.

“[Brown]’s a little more physical, but
he’s not as quick,” Harris said. “I had some
open looks, but they just didn’t fall for me.”

On the other end, Page knew the feel-
mg.

“Some of my shots went in and out,”
Page said.

As a team, Pitt shot just 35.6 percent
from the ﬂoor, but again, the Panthers held
their opponent under 40 percent as well,
limiting the Badgers to 17 ﬁeld goals on 48

1 attempts. The Panthers’ also forced

VV1sconsin into making 13 tumovers, seven
of which were steals, including two each

by Page and Carl Krauser.

‘They played great defense,” said
Wisconsin forward Mile Wilkinson. “They
play physical and get into you, that makes
it tough.”

Pitt, seeded third in its bracket, now
travels to East Rutherford, N .J ., to take on
Big 12 Champion and No. 2 seed
Oklahoma State, who advanced by defeat-
ing Memphis, 70-53, on Sunday. The
Panthers have advanced to the Sweet 16 in
the two previous seasons, bowing out to
Kent State in 2002 and Marquette last year.
Pitt was the higher seed in both games.

“You never know what can happen,”
Page added, “but I’m not ready to go home
yet.”
