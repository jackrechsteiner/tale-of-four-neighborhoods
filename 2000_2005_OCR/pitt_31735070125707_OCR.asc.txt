Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, speaking at a press conference sponsored by the Islamic

Council of Greater Pittsburgh, expressed his support for the Muslim community.

have a ﬂag of his own to hang at the
center.-

So he went to borrow one in the
neighborhood. He found one at the
first house he approached.

According to Maloney, ‘ the
woman offered the flag withouthes—
itation, saying that the flag had once
covered her mother’s casket and that
her mother, a politician in St. Louis
for more than 20 years, would have
wanted it that way- ‘

Speakers from 15 civic and reli-'

gious entities, including Pittsburgh
Mayor Tom Murphy and Allegheny
County Chief Executive Jim
Roddey, attended the press confer-
ence and urged unity across all sec-
tors after in the aftermath of the ter-
rorist attacks that leveled both tow-
ers of the World Trade Center an
portions of the Pentagon. - A
Murphy urged Americans not to
succumb to the divisiveness the

_ attacks could ultimately engender,

saying, “We lose the essence of what
this country is about if we turn
inward.” . ‘

While Pittsburgh’s Muslim com-
munity has not experienced the same
level of retaliatory harassment and
violence as some other areas, there

have been signs of tension. Calista‘ _

Weichel, who helped to organize the
event, expressed surprise at the
number of people in attendance.
Walter Shaahid, president of the
Islamic Council of Greater
Pittsburgh, opened the conference
by condemning the terrorist attacks

in New York and Washington, and
calling for aid to those working in
the relief effort. '

He also enjoined the media to

show restraint and avoid fanning the‘

ﬂames of anti-Muslim sentiment by
jumping to conclusions about the
identity or background of the perpe-
trators. '

Lavera Brown, executive dire,C- I

tor of the Pittsburgh branch of the

NAACP, said, “A daily constant is *

hate. We are all now living in an
intolerable atmosphere of fear.”
Weichel ‘knows that fear.
Weichel, a Muslim woman from
Pittsburgh, said she felt safer and

‘more welcome as an “obvious”

American in the West Bank last year

than she d’oes now, walking the .
streets of Pittsburgh as a “visible”-

Muslim.
Friday’s conference was the first
time Weichel felt comfortable wear-

_ing her hijab, the traditional head 

covering worn by Muslims, she said.

Until then she had worn a baseball 
cap to cover her hair, preferring to ,

avoid identification as a'Mus1im.
Weichel said that many of her

neighbors no longer talk to her. And .
according to her, the tense atmos- V
phere has affected her son, Dylan, 7, "

as well. -

On Thursday Dylan had refused 
to enter one of his favorite stores for f
fear that the shopkeeper “didn’t like f
him anymore.” Fortunately, when i
Weichel asked the shopkeeper to_ 
come and speak with Dylan, he did, 
reassuring the boy that he still liked r

him.

 Analysts question efficacy of
  military retaliation        

‘NORA _BOUSTANY
The Washington Post

During the last week, Arab

‘media around the —world'- have

offered audiencesa realistic viewof,

the immensity of last week’s tragedy

in America, voicing measured sym-
pathy for- the victims and concern
over reprisals against Arab-
Americans and Muslims, and raising
alarm over Washington’s mobiliza-
tion for war. ‘
Newspapers -and television sta-
tions in the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
Lebanon have run full coverage of
search and" rescue efforts in New
York’s financial center and the

Pentagon, of vigils and religious

services.

The Arabic-language Al Hayat
newspaper, based in London, led its
front page Saturday with a ‘graphic
and map of NATO bases and
weaponry deployed around the
Persian Gulf, the Middle East and

Europe -under the banner headline of ,

“America Goes to War.”

Yet many commentators ques-
tioned whether military action alone
will eliminate terrorism. Lebanese
columnist\Ghassan Tueni noted that
the threat to America does not come
from nuclear weapons, but from
hungry and oppressed people. Even
if Afghanistan is reduced to rubble,
the United States could remain a tar-
get for future attacks, wrote Abdel
Wahab Badrakhan in Al Hayat.

‘ “America will not be strong
enough to extract terrorism except
with different policies” in the
Mideast, he. added. U.S. policy in
the region is viewed by Arabs as
indifferent to the suffering of
Palestinians while offering Israel
unconditional support.

The dual message of condemna-
tion of terrorism and criticism of the
U.S. role in the Israeli-Palestinian
conﬂict echoed in mosques around
the. Arab world Friday. Preachers,
whose sermons are widely reported
in the media, refuted the targeting of
innocent civilians as a tenet of
Islam. “He who kills aperson with-
out necessity  will never go to
heaven,’-’ Sheikh Mohammed Sayed
Tantawi told worshippers in Cairo’s
Al Azhar mosque, one of Islam’s
leading institutions. ‘_‘It’s not

people.”

Front—page stories about the

of Middle Eastern descent have run

side-by-side with news reports on ‘

the FBI» investigation into the

hijackings. The media have also car?

ried blurbs on Lebanese and Yemeni
citizens killed in the World Trade
Center and aboard the hijacked
planes.

While a series of editorials
raised questions over America’s
ability to pinpoint and crush global
terrorism, that theme gave way over
the course of the week to soul
searching about the Arab and
Muslim condition and misper.cep-
tions of the Arab-experience in the
face of a growing rift with the West.

“These days, the Arab creature
is living under the yoke of a psycho-
logical terror that exceeds all hor-
rors he has known. The condemna-
tion of this creature precedes his
birth. Every "Arab is guilty until
proven innocent,” wrote _ Talal
Salman, editor of Beirut’s As Safir
daily. “Terrorism is reduced to him
alone in this vast world.” 5

D.C. unprepared to handle catastrophe

STEVE TWOMEY, CAROL D. LEONNIG
. & PETULA DVORAK
The Washington Post

WASHINGTON — In the dark
moments of Tuesday morning,
Washington’s emergency broadcast sys-
tem, the one so publicly and repeatedly
tested on local radio, was never activat-
ed, leaving the public unsure what was
false, true, open, shut. Many District
government cell and desk phones died
from overload, and the backups -for top
leaders — 10 satellite phones — were
of no help because nobody had them.
They were stored in an office, leaving
scattered officials unable to give or get
orders swiftly.

At 10:16 a.m., the mayor’s chief of
staff dispatched an e-mail telling hun-
dreds of workers in the govemment’s
Judiciary Square headquarters to
“EVACUATE BUILDING NOW,” only
to be countermanded less than four
minutes later. Perhaps most critically,
city police did not set in motion a well-
crafted, well-practiced plan to cope
with imminent terror assault — because
they had none.

“We had to create one,” said
District of Columbia Police Executive
Chief Terrance Gainer.

That Washington would be at the
crosshairs of any terrorist’s bomb site

has been a given within law enforce-
ment for years, the subject of seminars
and task forces and drills, but the
attacks Tuesday on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon were a real-
world‘ test that exposed a Vulnerable
city.
“Clearly, from what we’ve seen
from this unprecedented attack, we
need a higher level of preparedness,”
Mayor Anthony Williams said. “It’s a
top priority  that we need to be prac-
ticing across the government for all of
this.”

For police, especially, Tuesday
underscored just how unprepared they
were. The department could not tell its
3,800 ofﬁcers to go to Stage 3 or Level
5 of response,..Gainer said, because it
had no stages or levels. There was no
list of streets to close to thwart threats,
or make one-way to ease evacuation.
Nor were there guidelines spelling out
which ofﬁcers should go where, which
buildings must shut or ' which emer-
gency vehicles ought to be marshalled.

Likewise, Washington’s
Department of Health discovered
Tuesday that it had no radios to partici-
pate in the network used by hospitals to
swap information on bed availability
and other resources, an essential capa-
bility if there are mass casualties. “It
was not the ideal situation from our

standpoint,” said Larry Siegel, the
department’s deputy director.

When the federal Office of
Personnel Management decided about
10:30 a.m. that 260,000 federal workers
-— 180,000 of them in the city — were
free to go and thus would begin choking
streets, federal officials told some city
officials, but not police. “We had to
learn that from the media,” Gainer said.

‘ On Capitol Hill, fire alarms that
might have armounced a need to evacu-
ate the House and Senate were not used,
a long-standing evacuation plan never
went into effect and escape-route maps

were outdated. In the frightening’

moments after American Airlines Flight
77 slarrirned into the Pentagon, the Hill
often did not know what to do. One aide
said that when colleagues called the

U.S. Capitol Police seeking guidance n
about leaving, the response was: It’s up I

to you.

v“There clearly was no plan that was
known to members, Capitol Police or
leadership that was implemented,” said
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D—Md., the ranking
Democrat on the committee that over-
sees the Capitol,Police.

What happened downtown —
clogged traffic as workers reacted to
live television reports and headed home
— was predicted as recently as July,
when the Federal Emergency

Management Agency and local officials

, concocted a scenario in which terrorists
‘release poison gas at hot dog stands,

one at 17th and D streets Northwest and
one on the Mall near the Museum of
American History.

That imagined chaos led FEMA

_ and the director of the city’s Emergency

Management Agency to conclude that,
when terror strikes, the public must be
given information within an hour to

‘ knock down rumors, explain the fastest

routes out of town and pinpoint areas to
avoid. Use ‘ the Washington Area
Warning System, the radio network
whose tests are familiar to all, they
urged. Or call an immediate news con-
ference.

“It’s clear these [emergency
response] things didn’t happen Tuesday
because we didn’t have a plan,” said
Bruce Baughman, a top FEMA official.
“If this doesn’t get people committed to
it, I don’t know what will.”

Washington and other jurisdictions _

have had guidelines for confronting
emergencies generally, especially hurri-
canes and snowstorms. And the city has
also crafted specific playbooks for other
large, potentially disruptive events that
it knows are coming, such as the possi-
ble computer breakdowns associated
with the millennium, .and protests
against the International Monetar.

TARA SUTTON
The Pitt News

Residence Life, in conjunction with

the Counseling Center, held special meet- '

ings during the weekend to discuss the
tragedies that took place in our nation last
week ’

According to VV1lliam Klewien, resi-
dent director of Tower B, the sessions were
meant to “give students a chance to express
their concerns and emotions.”

Each residence hall held its own dis-
cussion group. A resident director and a
liaison from the Counseling Center were
present at each meeting. , ‘

But just as the number of students on
campus dwindled this weekend, the atten-
dance at the discussion groups was thin as
well. .

“Ihe time line was short,” Klewien
said. The time and location of some of the
meetings had not yet been conﬁrmed as of
early Friday afternoon, so many of the
meetings came with little notice.

The discussion group held for the resi-

dents of Tower C consisted of two resident
directors, a counselor and a freshman resi-
dent. _

Michele Scott Taylor, resident director
of Tower C, said, “Even though there was
only one [student],” those in attendance did
get something out of the conversation.
Topics ranged ﬁom what America’s next
step should be to the signiﬁcance of every-
day problems in contrast to the national
emergency. T

Samuel Friedman, the freshman who
attended the discussion, didn’t lose anyone
personally, but said he felt a huge loss.

“I’ve seen a lot of images,” he said.
“And [I] wanted to talk about it”

Noting the low attendance, 
suggested that more discussion groups
could be held, since some students might
not feel the full effect of the tragedy until
later in the week »

Klewien said the goal of the discus-'

sions was to let students know what
resources are available to them. “For those
that didn’t come, they at least know the
resources are there,” she said.

Forum, page 1

through the four speakers’ addresses.
Beginning with a moment of silence, the
lecture, held by the Graduate ‘School of
Public and International Aﬂairs, sought
to link these hijackings with history and
give the audience a context in which to
interpret them. ' V V
Michael Brenner, a GSPIA profes-
sor, called for “a singularity of minds
and sentiments” in America’s under-
standing and interpretation of the events.
Each speaker emphasized that ‘these
events ﬁt into the past, and that these
instances involved violence and terror

V tactics.

Referencing, everything from the
Anglo-Saxon invasion of the British

Isles to the Civil War to‘the l979.Iranian _

mediate tension

revolution, the speakers cited precedent
in order‘ to explain the current happen-
ings. As one speaker said, “We need des-
perately to establish distance,” to evalu-
ate and interpret last Tuesday’s crashes.
Another topic discussed was the

nature of terrorism. Brenner, focusing on_
the former subject, called terrorism “the

willful and wanton organized killing of

civilians. . .[to] intimidate a population in.

order to subjugate them.” He also
explained that total warfare was an
assault on a country’s socialand eco-
nomic as well as political systems.

Pitt professor Donald Goldstein
recalled this idea. Speaking “as an old
man and an old soldier,” Goldstein said,
“this is a new era of warfare. . .[with] less
electronic intelligence and more human
intelligence.” 5

Vigils provide emotional

“In my 18 years, I’ve never seen such
pride and faith and unity in America,” Pitt
freshman Bill Morse said, his voice boom-
ing through the loudspeakers scattered on
the lawn. Morse spoke of his feelings of
hopelessness -after the attack and of how
public gatherings like this vigil had buoyed
his spirits. "

“I just kind of came up with the
thoughts oif the top of my head,” Morse said
after speaking. “'I‘hey’ve just been stirring in
my heart the last three days.”

Morse said that his friend, Jon Hill, who
had distributed yellow ribbons on campus in
the days since the tragedy, inspired much of
his speech. “He’s really motivated me to take
more action,” Morse said.

But the atmosphere was by no means
festive. Only quick and subdued applause
greeted the majority of speakers. '

The atmosphere at Heinz Chapel,

which held a silent vigil to give the public the
opporttmity to pray and reﬂect on the
tragedies, was even more somber.

People shuffled in and out of the chapel
during the two-hour vigil. They came in all
attires — middle-aged businesspeople in suits
and ties, students in jeans and T-shirts,
ret1'reesinpoloshirtsandkhakis.Many
clutched ﬂags from the Soldiers and Sailors -
vigil.

‘ In the ﬁont of the chapel, where one

‘ expects to ﬁnd a preacher or priest, only an

empty altar greeted the mourners. As people
left, they often glanced back over their
shoulders, as if holding out hope for some
divine guidance. 

“It helped me to know that our commu-
nity could pull together,” Pitt student Gena
Sunnan said, after a half-hour inside the
chapel. It was Su1man’s second trip to the

. chapel since the tragedy. “It helps me per-

sonally, at least It’s better to be out with peo-
ple than sitting alone in your home.”

EDITORIAL

Returning to normalcy
with a new perspective

This weekend was different from any
other weekend of our lives —— not just
because there wasn’t a football game, or
because we felt a little guilty partying ——
but because the memory of Tuesday’s
tragedy was still fresh in our minds as we
attempted to return to our normal routines.

Compliments of nonstop news chan-
nels, the images of the twin towers col-
lapsing into a heap of rubble are forever
burned into our collective memories.

And while time moves on and shock
ebbs, we have slowly started shifting back
into our everyday existence. We have
begunto return to normalcy with an air of
respect for those affected by the tragedy.

But this sense of routine comes with a
lack of certainty. Our generation has not
had a part in war of any sort, and this
country has never seen terrorism as an act
of war. We struggle to return to some form
of daily routine, but we don’t yet know
what lies ahead for our country or our
peers.

These events and the subsequent
uncertainty put our lives in perspective.
We took a step back and examined our-
selves and looked for places and ways to
heal. We attended the vigils, were com-
passionate at the forums and solemn at
religious services.

we contributed to fund-raisers and
spent some extra time-talking with loved
ones. We ﬂocked to blood drives, only to
be turned away because so many others
had already donated. ' I

We gained a renewed sense of patrio-
tism. Stores sold out of American ﬂags. As
a gesture of support and solidarity,’ we
hungﬂags on our cars and taped paper
copies to our windows.

In the next few weeks as thepolitical
outcomes of Tuesday’s attacks become
clearer, we must not forget the perspective
we have gained, nor should we neglect the
positive responses we have seen. .

For example, while blood banks may
have surpassed their abilities to process
blood right now, the need for blood will
not cease after the national crisis has

passed. Pittsburgh with its many large

medical centers always has a high demand
for blood. .

Similarly, we must not abandon the
national unity that has resulted from
Tuesday’s attacks. Even after the crisis
passes, we should not take down the many
ﬂags we have raised. We must continue to
embrace our fellow Americans, regardless
of their religion or national heritage. And
we must never forget the American ideals
of acceptance and unity.

I ﬁrst picked up on this fact late
Friday night. We were sitting on the roof

At‘ this point I was on my ‘feet. The

Learning to cope witha mob of 14-year-olds

A couple of my friends asked me if
I wanted to be a camp counselor this
summer at our old Jew camp. I was
shocked to hear the words “eh, whatev-
er,” come out of my mouth.

Aren’t I really lazy?
Was I really willing to give
up glorious 12-hour nights
of sleep and 12-hour days
of TV watching to boss
around an army of ungrate-
ful,_ jumpy prepubescent
bastards?

I don’t know why I
decided to do it. I knew I’d
be exposed as the irrespon-

     

Benjamin Rubin
Columnist

said, “Bad choice, Tiger. I
don’t want to hear that kind
» of saucy potty talk coming
out of your pie hole on my
watch. Comprende?”

He gave me the finger
and walked away.

I had a lot to learn
about slangin’ with the
young folks, as each was
“special” in his own way.

There was Astalos (Oz)

sible moron I was just as
soon as one of the kids
died. What parents would ever trust me
with their child? I spend most of my
life dodging work and masturbating
onto my stomach. I. was scared as all
hell.

When I showed up for staff orienta-
tion, I found out I would be taking care
of 17 14-year-olds. Seventeen!

My co--counselor was a spicy
Israeli nutcase named Oded who was
halfway through his army service. He
would often take me aside to have frank
discussions about how much he hated
me.

My home became a filthy wooden
shack unfit for circus midgets, built in a
huge ﬁeld in a valley fully encom-
passed by trees. We packed 19 dudes
into an area the size of my grandmoth-
er’s funny-smelling bathroom, with two

who I was always afraid
would -kick my ass if he caught me
behind some bunks with no one else
around. '

Berger would tell dirty late-night
stories about all the girls he wished he
could screw. He loved attention. When
I was supposed to be shutting him up, I
actually couldn’t stop laughing about
the indecent things he was saying he’d
do to the Olson twins. And how could I
blame him?

Akiva — row ﬁve, right side, bot-

-tom bunk — was the medicated one. He

was either totally zoned out with his
mouth half open or frantically shaking
from being drunk on life. On our day-
long nature hike, I chose to ignore the
fact that he didn’t take his Amerol. I’ve
never seen someone so pumped about
nature. He was more stoned than a hip-

pie at a Phish concert, and he didn’t
even have to pay for it. .

I also had a bunch of hearty, loving
dudes who actually listened to me, like
Kai, Freeman, Joel and Donny.

Heller was the weird, artsy outcast
who I didn’t like because he_ was
smarter than me.

D.J. ' was the graffiti artist who
looked like Harry Potter. We were
paired up with a girl’s bunk, but who
cares about girls? Everyone knows they
have cooties. '

By coping with my mob of 14-
year-olds, I learned that there was a

‘ strong, mature authoritative ﬁgure in

me that I surely repressed through my
TV addiction. Using my newfound

fatherly powers, I commanded my bunk '
of evil misﬁts with confidence. Of

course I became drunk with power, but
it still felt great to be a role model and
lead those kids.

Sure, they exploited me every
chance they got and tried overthrowing
my monarchy several times, but I think
I got through to them after a while.

Unfortunately, no matter how much
they respected me, no one would get
out of bed in the morning for at least
ﬁve minutes. I knew why, I just didn’t
want to think about it.

Pretty much, they were great as
long as I didn’t try to make them do
anything. ’

Oded was learning new things, too,
like how it’s not OK to slap a kid upside

- the head, no matter how much you want

to. _I agreed with him — Americans are
too uptight. If it wasn’t for the lousy
American Camping Association those

‘kids would have received the beatings .

they deserved. No — needed.

My most rewarding and cherished
moments in camp were when the kids
looked to me for advice like I was some
genius. One time I set Steven’s mind at
ease when he told me he thought he
destroyed his penis by -masturbating
with antibacterial soap. Of course not,
buddy. It’s just going to sting like her-
pes for about a week. a .

After working with these young-’
sters, I realized that adults and kids
have strange misconceptions about
each other.

I know I needed to go through.
some odd phases.in my life to become ‘

the man I am today — like the “lie on
my stomach and rub my pee-pee on the
carpet” phase and the “spin around in

‘circles while watching Care Bears

movies until I pass _out and vo_rnit”
phase (that one ended a few weeks
ago); .

Still, the main thing I learned this
summer was to. get a vasectomy. Kids
are moronic and I hate being responsi-
ble. It’s goddanm tiring. Don’t get me’
wrong —I still love those crazy mon-
key freaks. They were just annoyin
most of the time. »

Ben Rubin hopes this column provided
a happy distraction during this time of
mourning.

Concessions unacceptable when responding toterror

“The meek shall inherit the earth.”

“All we are saying is give peace a chance.”
“War: What is it good for? Absolutely noth-
ing.” '

Ironically, our cutthroat culture is inundated
with cliches promoting peace and submission.
Though Americans are perfectly content to show
die-hard aggression on Wall Street or in the
office, they value the life of the individual above
all else. We’re terrified of going to war, and I
can’t argue for bombs instead of flowers.

But when is peace not the answer?

Pacifists cry that if America goes to war, we
will only be defending our foolish pride. Yet
where do we draw the line between noble nation-
al honor and indecent arrogance? We could easi-
ly put our heads in the sand, abandoning all dig-
nity, and beg for mercy from our attackers. If we
offer the right concessions, they might even
leave us alone —- after a few more attacks to test
the sincerity of our subordinance.

I keep hearing that this is a time for diplo-
macy, not war. I am ashamed to hear my peers
talking about making concessions such as back-
ing out of Israel, as if we could dangle a carrot
in front of the Taliban and make it stop hating

us. We need to eliminate the leadership driving

the hate. No concession would be the “right”
concession.
We could give‘ up our role as a

Appeasement has never established a lasting
peace and it ‘never will. It didn’t work with

of distinction. The world would lose
its strongest beacon of democracy and
our nation would abandon every ideal
upon which it has been founded.

But at least we’d be freed of our
obligation as international babysitter.
We would never have to declare war
again. We might even enjoy a few
years of shameful peace. That is, until
our enemies decide they want more

Columnist

By taking the cowardlyroad of

How long can we stave off another attack?
Perhaps we can bargain for a few months, weeks
or even years. But as long as we remain a strong-
hold for democracy and justice, we will always
be a target for those who oppose our values.

If we forsake our ideals, we will have noth-
ing left for which to stand. Without conviction,
without heart and without strength, America will

Student government to
host vigil on Cathedral
lawn

The University of Pittsburgh stu-
dent government is coordinating a
silent vigil on the Cathedrallawn
this Tuesday, a week after the terror-
ist attacks in New York City,
Washington, D.C.,_and Somerset
County. The vigil will last from 8:45
a.m. until 10:37 a.m., because these
are the confinned times when the

‘first plane struck the World Trade

Center and the time when the last
plane went down in Somerset.
The vigil will be ,held in honor of

all the victims and their families who

have been tragically affected by this
horrific act of violence. It is our
hope to include all members of the

_ Pitt family to join in this vigil, so

that as a unified University we may
honor and commemorate those who

have suffered as a result of a terror- ‘

ist act earlier this week. ,

It is during times such as these
when we face our most difficult
challenges and feelings of helpless-
ness pervade, we can, as a group,
provide strength to one another by
standing united’ against this adversi-
ty; As student government, we invite
you to participate in this University

‘ silent vigil so that we may be reas-

sured that our strength is more pow-
erful than the adversity we currently
face. ' '

or concerns, please contact the stu-
dent government office at 648-7970.

Taking a ﬁrst step against a
human tendency toward
racism

There is no justiﬁcation for racism
and intolerance in any form —— and yet

human nature seems to include “visual ‘

discrin1ination.” I have never understood
the thinking behind the incarceration of
J apanese—Americar1s during World War H
until now — the Japanese became per-
ceived enemies who could be easily iden-
tiﬁed. I lived in New York City for years,
I embraced the multi—cultures that co-
existed in the everyday New York.City
environment and I grieve for them. I
know that many people of Middle Eastem
descent worked and died in the World
Trade Center, and I grieve for them as
well. But I can tell you that on the after-
noon of Sept. 11, an Arab face or garment
would have made me want to lash out in
some way. Iiapplaud anyone who is not in

touch with this baser human instinct.

As one student said in a recent Pitt
News, ‘.‘When something like this hap-
pens, it’s common in U.S. history to ﬁnd

- a scapegoat.” It is small comfort as an

American to believe that at least in the
United States, the scapegoats aren’t
immediately rounded up and executed as
we have seen happen in so many other
countries. To say that this search for a
scapegoat is wrong is very accurate; to
say that this is only “common i11 U.S. his-
tory” is not. ‘
This new excuse for overt racism is
literally fear in disguise. Like it or not, this
new fear is perceived by many to be real
—— and justiﬁed. What can we do? A
ﬁiend said to me, “I will never again get
on a plane with anyone who appears to be

‘ Arabic.” In light of these recent horriﬁc

events, let’s not pretend that we don’t
understand — and in some way echo —
her concern.

Again, what can we do? What does
this student suggest? Where do we start?
We all know in our rational hearts that all
people of Middle Eastern descent who
live in America are not "responsible for‘
these terrible events. Bin Laden has won
this round — we are afraid.

It’s time to return to our
studies

Maybe I am alone here, but I feel just
as safe today as I did on Monday. I see all
these people who are crying for people
they never knew and I feel bad for them. I
see people who are paranoid about what
could happen to them and are rtmning
home or being overprotective. This could

happen to the University any day or any

 

night. Today is just another day and I wish
that the teachers would stop talking about
this great tragedy and get on with the
semester. '

Now I am not cold-hearted. This was
a great tragedy. The world is different. I
don’t know how, but everyone keeps
telling me it is. The question is what can
you do about it?

I am in the U.S. Marine Corps
Reserves. I may get called off to war.
People frequently come and talk to me
about joining the  I ask them if
they are willing to give their life for their
country. Are they willing to die so that

others may live another day? Most-

answer no, but a few are noble and say
yes. To the few that say yes, I_ welcome
them and would be glad to have them at
my side in war. To the others, I tell them
to go give blood and leave the war to peo-
ple like me and my fellow servicemen and
women. '

My one teacher really armoyed me
today when he asked what kind of men-
tality that the suicide bombers must have
had to give their life to do this. I just stared
at him with my mouth shut.

I could not bring myself to start an
argument. Has he never believed in some-
thing enough to be willing to give his life
for it? Maybe his wife? Maybe his chil-
dren? I think that a person who. is so self-
centered to be unable to sacriﬁce them-

selves for what they think is right is miss-

ing a lot in life. I am only 20, but I know
that there are things and people who I

would gladly give my life for. Maybe I am

a giving person, but I don’t think so.

To conclude my ranting, I believe that
the people who died and who are working
to help ﬁx this should be honored. I am
sony for anyone who has lost a loved one.
But let’s get back to our educations.

conquéifihg a fire-breathfitngitibrnfieId maze

DAVE HARTMAN
Contrizbuting Editor

I speed down winding roads
through hilly Pennsylvania forests,
breathing in the unrivaled magnifi-
cence of a fall motorcycle ride. My

Saturday afternoon. trip to Maize‘

Quest — a six-acre cornfield-turned-
giant-maze —— is almost more about
getting there. A

The motorcycle is a recent addi-
tion to my life, purchased only three
weeks ‘ago strictly to increase the
amount of fun I have, and its pur-
chase is among the best decisions

l’ve made. I may sing a different‘

song when a Pittsburgh winter sends
chills deep into my adventure-loving
heart, but for now I’m happy.

All autumnal equinoxes aside, it
is fall. Brisk, beautiful Saturday
afternoons make it so. It’s football
weather, pumpkin-carving weather
and most certainly ‘motorcycling
weather. . .

So I set out at about noon on
Saturday, a slightly postponed depar-
ture thanks to late-night merrymak-
ing on Friday. I hopped aboard the

Elizabeth. As we turned off 51 and
onto-fa mostly quiet one-way street

‘_throughAElizabeth, Pa., the ride’s

moodchanged too. No more rushed
merging across three lanes of traffic
between tractor-trailers and buses.

No more View pollution, the unfortu-

nate consequence of urban sprawl.

In Elizabeth, it’s just my compan-
ion, the road and me. We zip past the
two- and three-story buildings, make
an awkward turn onto an even more
winding road and head toward. a sea
of yellow “sharp curves fahead” signs.

And then there’s the farm. Small
hand-painted signs with corncobs and
pumpkins lead you there from just

outside Elizabeth. Triple B Farms,

presumably_ named for three of its
owners -— the Beinlichs, sits cozily
between the rolling hills and valleys.

a wooden castle that marks the entrance. Colored
barricade tape lines the 3-foot—wide paths, leading
the maze’s entrants nowhere in particular. A gigan-
tic electrical tower serves as the only landmark that
can be seen from almost everywhere —-— the stalks
are too tall to provide victims a reasonable idea of
where they are in the maze.

After a few minutes of aimless walking, we run
into Bill, who says he knows almost every square
foot of the maze. “If you need help, let me know,”
he says. _ :

People who pay to get lost probably don’t like
asking for help to become un-lost. I’m'sure we’ll
figure it out. ' I -

It’s barely surprising that corn begins to look
the same after the first few minutes. After dozens
of turns and loops through the same stalks of corn,
the prognosis was poor: We were meant to perish
in the middle of a man—made maze.

If only -I had remembered a water bottle, or-

eaten anything of substance that morning. If :only I
had taken a pair of 3-D glasses, or let Bill give me

‘a helping hand. If only I’d»said goodbye to my

family. .

Then, as if by chance, we spotted a way out.
Escape from the maze was ours as we ran —— in
‘direct violation of Maize Quest rules — to the
field’s perimeter.’ ' T - '

It was with genuine jubilarice that we leaptout
of the maze’s entrance, a small miscalculation that
left us with a-itaste of embarrassment mixed with
incompetence; Discouraged but determined, we re-
entered the maze in search of the exit. ’

DAVE HARTMAN/CONTRIBUTING EDIToR

Ahhh  the daunting entrance to the labyrinth of
terror.

After another 25 minutes of aimless wander-
ing, we earned sweet success at the field’s true
exit, claiming victory over not only the maze, but
also over the other people still milling blindly

«through its corn-lined corridors. .
Clearly, they didn’t have what it takes to make

it in the world of labyrinth-like vegetation. But we
did. And as we strolled out of the maze, the field’s
purposeseemed clearer: we had beaten the beast.

In the struggle between man and nature, we
had won.»We had conquered the most ferocious of
battles; we made it out of the cornfield.
_ And better yet, we got to ride the motorcycle
home, too. ‘ -

“We have a few people who are-

a nice family setting here,” Steinmiller
said. The long, wooden dinner tables
can comfortably accommodate fami-

“It’s very interesting, I’ve never

It’s 4 p.m. on a Wednesday and storeowner Kris
Schneider, 30, looks a little nervous.

“I haven’t had a sale yet today, actually,” admits
Schneider. With her pink lipstick and pink streaks in her
hair to match, she ﬁts perfectly into the cozily cool
ambiance of Swank Gear.

Nestled on 13th Street in the South Side, Swank
Gear is a haven for people looking for anything with
leopard, ﬂames or pin-up girls. The store boasts brands
such as Lucky 13 and Porn Star, and the walls overﬂow
with bowling shirts, bachelor pad accessories and plaid
skirts. v

“I just don’t think you should be able to walk into a
mall and buy these kinds of items,” said Schneider, who
also runs the store’s Web site, www.swankgear.com.

Ironically, it was the scarcity of underground culture
that inspired Schneider to start her own business.
Originally from North Hills, Pa., she started getting into
What she calls “punk rock culture” in her early teens.

“Growing up, we had to order everything through
mail order,” she said. “But unfortunately by the time I
got to the point of doing this, it’s in the malls now.”

proposals and meetings with the bank

when business is nonexistent

“Business is severely up and down,” Schneider said.
‘‘There’s no trend whatsoever.” But she said the free-
doms of rrmning her shop are well worth the trouble.

“When it’s your own business, you never really get
bored,” she said. “Even if there is a lot to work to do,
you’re still doing it for yourse .”

Schneider sees a variety of patrons, from college
students to South Side locals to tattoo artists. She is con-
cerned that potential cus_tomers may be attracted to larg-
er chain stores. ~

“[The stores] try so hard to be shocking, but they’re
limited in what they can order,” she said, and referred to
the Porn Star line that many chains  “They
aren’t even allowed to order what you guys want.”

She stresses the importance of supporting small
business across the board.

“It’s important to understand what goes on there,
and how much more they appreciate the business,”

CHAD MARTIN
Staff Writer

The proprietors of Photo Antiquities on
East Ohio Street are very proud to show off
their current exhibition, “The First
Americans,” which highlights a collection

of the most inﬂuential portraits of North
American natives. The collection will be at
the North Side museum until Nov. 30.

The late Edward Sheriff Curtis was an
expert in Native American photography. He
spent the majority of his life documenting
the lives of nearly 80 diiferent tribes across
America and north into Canada and Alaska.
Curtis’ objective was to educate people
about the Native Americans. In 1930, he
completed his 20-volume collection, ‘The
North American Indian Project,” which he
began at the turn of the century in an effort
to record the lives of a fading culture.

Photo Antiquities already has of one of
Curtis’ renowned prints. "Ihe Vanishing
Race” from 1904 is an orotone print of a
group of Navajos riding into darkness. An
orotone print means that a photograph has

been printed on glass and placed atop a
gold background. This technique gives the
image an illusion of three dimensions and
contributes to the realism and poignancy of
the piece.

In addition to this piece, the museum
also has countless other photographs and
many antique pieces of photographic
equipment. Now with “The First
Americans” as a temporary part of their
repertoire, Photo Antiquities is simply
incredible to history buffs, photo enthusi-
asts and explorative college students alike.

The key element to the beauty of the
collection is the focus on detail. One partic-
ular procedure in photography that seems
to magnify this emphasis of detail is the
photogravure. Through the use of both
chemical and mechanical processes, the
resulting image becomes utterly precise
and vibrant. While a photograph is a com-
pilation of unconnected dots forming

Pablo Picasso first challenged the
notion of high art in 1912 when he cre-
ated “Guitar” out of rusted sheet metal.
Then Dada artist Marcel Duchamp
shocked the artgrworld in
1917 with his refady-made
work “Fountain”: by ques-
tioning the deﬁnition of art.
These two pieces made
other materials more acceptable in
“high art.”

At the beginning of the 20th centu-
ry, quilts, the most commonly known
form of ﬁber art, held no artistic value.
The genre of fiber arts did not come
into its own until the‘ late ‘70s and
early ‘80s. Artists
Miriam Schapiro (“Wonderland,”
1983) and Faith Riaggold (“Who’s
Afraid of Aunt Jemima,” 1983)
worked with the stereotype that quilts
and needlework are a woman’s craft to
criticize the male hierarchy in the art
world.

Oct. 27. A defining credibility is devel-
oping for a medium once reserved for
“skilled crafts.”

Materials such as paper, rope, fab-
rics and any other materials that con-
sist of fibers boast the advantage of
texture over most other materials.
Artists at the biennial used this advan-
tage to create organic,
almost plant—1ike or
mold-like works. '

The reef—like appear-
ance of Angie. Harbin’s,
“Citrona,” contributes to the organic
feel of the materials. ,With the help of
encaustic wax, it has a shine that real
underwater reefs have. The piece’s
orange color even resembles some-
thing grown only in nature because the
tones vary.

Arlette Verrneiren-Zucoli’s prize-
winning work, “Paper II,” continues
the theme as a curtain of twisted paper
drapes its space. Much like “Citrona,”
in an outdoor environment, no one can
tell that it’s man-made except under
close examination.

Fewer restraints in composition
and color juxtaposition are another
advantage of ﬁber art.

allow for the life and warmth of facial fea-

The ﬁrst piece in the collection is “Two

formerly named Little Bull. He earned the
name Two Strike after he killed two men

assorted fabrics form the collage,

“Echo,” a work by Japanese artist Al
Kijima, which could be a response
to abstract expressionist Morris
Louis. Whereas Louis stains a can-
va‘s with paint to minimize any
buildup of paint, Kijima’s “Echo”
thrives on texture by building up
layers of cloth. Both artists’ works

depend on luminous colors, but the ,

colors of “Echo” are richer in value.

Though there is no recurring
theme that all the pieces follow, the
only prerequisite is that they’re
formed of ﬂaws. An undeniable
variety of contrasts exists in every

work. Some return to a traditional
mode by creating knitted works and .
quilts to make patterns and decora-
tion. Some artists take the road less
traveled — like Anna Torma and her
graffiti art inﬂuence piece
“Narrative Series: Silence.” No
doubt, all works are obviously intri-
cate and detailed. But time-consum-
ing labor is required for such rich
texture and color.

Fiber is no longer considered
second-rate; instead, ﬁber is one of
the best mediums for the experimen-
tation of textures and colors. Catch

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

While most collegiate sports
were either canceled or postponed
this weekend, the Pitt rugby team
was in action for its first game of
the season.

The Panthers defeated league
rival Franciscan University by a
score of 11-6 Saturday to open up
the year at 1-0. Each team had two
penalty kicks, one of which resulted
in the win for Pitt.

Although the 'season,has begun,
the team is still we1comi_ng new
members. There are no tryouts or
cuts, and no experience is neces-
sary. I

The team practices. Tuesday, .

Thursday and,Friday from 4-6 p.m.
on the Cathedral lawn. This will be
the last week for new recruits to
join the team.  .

According to coach Dan Talbert,
rugby is “an organized game of ‘kill

the guy with the ball.”’ Anyone‘

interested in playing needs no spe-
cial equipment, because people who
have never seen the game will

I learn.

The team is fairly young, made
up primarily of sophomores and
juniors, along with an extensive
group of freshman recruits.

‘ In addition, about two—thirds of
the team is completely new to the
game. '

The team originally had 93 stu-
dents interested in playing this sea-
son. That number has dropped to
about half, but. Talbert is looking
for 40-50 members for the team.

“It’s a game that athletes can
pick up in a few weeks, and it’s a
good time,” Talbert said. ‘

Pitt plays in the Allegheny
Rugby Union, which consists of six
local schools including Slippery
Rock and West Virginia.

The Panthers will return to
action Sept. 23 when they travel to
league rival Clarion. The game is
scheduled for 1 p.m.

Accepting a sports-free weekend after tragedy

Since last week’s tragedy, the
sports. world has come to a halt. It
was a strange weekend, one devoid
of the usual games. The National

JumboTron during the fourth inning.
But when I woke up Wednesday
morning, the nation was in the midst

of attempting to recover from the-

Football League post-
poned Sunday’s‘ games, “
and in college football,
there were no Division 1-
A contests.

Major ' League
Baseball stadiums were
empty as pennant races
and the home run chase
were put on hold. °

It’s usually very hard
to imagine life without
sports, but this weekend,
it didn’t seemto bother

previous day’s tragedy,
and I felt guilty about
wanting the day to be spe-
cial. ’ ‘

As much as I wanted
to go to the game that
evening, I knew that it
would only be appropriate
for the league to cancel the
day’s games once again.

I realized that some-'
times sports just do not

me at all.

Wednesday night I was supposed
to ‘go to the Mets/Pirates game to cel-
ebrate my 20th birthday. ‘

I am a die hard Mets fan and it was
perfect to’ see my team on my birth-

V day.

I bought my tickets the day they
went on sale back in March and had
been looking forward to it ever since.

I was even going to have a spe-
cial birthday wish ﬂash acrossithe

matter, not even if it is
your birthday.
In life, there are

many things that-are more important.

When I heard the Saturday
Pitt/Alabama1Birmingham game had
been postponed, I was upset because
my best friend was visiting‘ from
Texas and I had been looking for-
ward to taking her to the game.

But after a while it made sense to

me, because who could possibly
enjoy a game, cheering and tailgat-
ing, while our country prepares for

war? ,
I didn’t even miss yesterday’s
NFL games -.- maybe because it’s

only the second week of the season,
but more likely’ because I’ve grown
up and not made sports such a high
priority in my life.

Last week I thought the sports
world should resume regular play by

. the weekend, that life goes on and

the nation would not overcome its
grief with just a few days off. But as
the" days went by with no games, I
didn’t feel the empty feeling
expected I would. _ I
For a few days I forgot how
many home runs Barry Bonds has, or
who was playing the Monday night

’ football game.

I forgot about the big-name

matchups in college football and the"

speculation about how Pitt would

L bounce back from a tough loss.

None of it seems to matter any-
more.

If it is hard for the fans to get
back into the ﬂow, it must be espe-
cially difficult for the athletes.
Everyone has been hit emotionally
and it is selfish to expect the players

to forget everything and get back on
the field. .

Sports are very demanding, not
just physically, but emotionally as
well.

Players are regular people who

have been affected by the recent

events.

It will take the nation a very long
time to recover from last week’s
attacks, but eventually sports will
return to their_regular schedules.

Major League Baseball resumes

play today, and I will not lie and ‘say

I’m not excited about it.
I will finally have the chance to
see the Mets. when they play the

Pirates tonight here in Pittsburgh

after the series was moved from New
York.

But it will most likely be a very
strange feeling going to a baseball
game, rooting on the blue and orange

while the nation around my continues «

Former Cal athlete
feared dead in attack

MATT DUFFY
Daily Californian

Former California football and
baseball player Brent Woodall last
spoke with his father shortly after

the first hijacked plane crashed into

the North Tower of the World Trade
Center. .

“I get up early and watch CNBC
every morning,” John Woodall said
from his home in La Jolla, Calif.,
Thursday. “(Brent) called and said,
‘Are you seeing this? They’re say-
ing someone ﬂew a plane into the
tower.’ I was thinking, ‘What yahoo
would be ﬂying low enough to ﬂy a
plane into a building?’ I wasn’t
thinking it was a terrorist attack.”

The call came at 5:45 a.m.,
while Brent’s mother Mary was
walking the dogs. .

After speaking to his son, John
Woodall got in the shower and did

not hear the phone when Brent

called again.

A- stock trader for Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods, Brent Woodall
worked on the 89th ﬂoor of the
South Tower, the second tower hit
by a hijacked plane. Woodall, 31,
called back to California again and

‘left a message on his parents’

answering machine.
“He called again when I was in
the shower and said, ‘We’re getting

the hell out of here. Here’s my

wife’s cell phone number, call her.’
That’s the last I heard fromhim.”
Later, Brent Woodall called ‘his
wife Tracy, telling her that he was
having trouble getting a door open
on the 87th ﬂoor. \ ‘
“Even if they got it open, I can’t
imagine getting through the smoke
and ‘the heat,” John Woodall said.
“(But) people did get out. I’m try-

ing not to speculate and hope for

the best.”

Brent Woodall is now one of the
4,763 victims still missing.

John Woodall said workers res-
cued from the rubble Thursday an
employee who worked at the same

‘ firm as his son.

The investment company had
offices on the 88th and,89th ﬂoors
of the South Tower.

Those who knew Woodall from
his time at Cal recalled a smart and

likable person who was an impor-
tant part of some successful Cal
teams. ,

Woodall was. a four-year starter
at tight end for the Bears football
team from 1988-91. He played on
Cal teams that won ba°ck—to-back
bowl games his junior and senior
years. .

“A great guy,” said David
Ortega, who was a junior when
Woodall joined the team as a" fresh-
man. “He just came in and played.
He was such a good football player
that he came in and played tight end
and running back. I’ think he even
threw a couple of passes.”

Woodall won the Andrew L.
Smith Scholarship Award his senior
year, which is awarded for academ-
ic excellence. After the football

- season, Woodall played baseball for

the Bears in the spring.
He then went on to graduate

"school at what was to become the

Haas School of Business and played
another year of baseball.

‘As a left-handed reliever,
Woodall helped. Cal reach «the
College World Series in 1992.

Bob Milano, who coached the

Cal baseball team for 22 seasons
before retiring two years ago,
reﬂected fondly of Woodall.

“Brent was one of those guys

that was real easy to like,” Milano"
said. “Aninteresting young man.’

You knewhe was going to do very

well doing whatever he didafter he »

was done playing sports.”

' Woodall pitched for two seasons
in the Chicago Cubs minor-league
system in 1993 and ‘94.

Milano also said he has not
heard from Cody McCormick, who
played for Cal from 1993-95, and
works in downtown Manhattan.

Ortega, who is now the football
team’s academic enhancement coor-
dinator, said Woodall was planning
a return to Berkeley at the end of
this month for a players’ reunion
the weekend of the Ca1—Washington
football game.

“He was just e—mailing me,”
Ortega said. “He was excitedabout
having a ‘91 reunion. I got an e-
mail from him about a week and a
half ago. He wanted to stay
involved. lt’s just very sad.”

“The   Rock” impressive
as Nebraska linebacker

JOHN GASKINS
Daily Nebraskan

Jamie Burrow remembers the first
time he stood up in front of Nebraska
coach Craig Bohl’s linebacker unit.

I The young, well-mannered, slight-
ly chubby freshman stood up and
introduced himself as “Jamie.” -

He was jeered.

Jay Foreman, the hulking starting
Nebraska middle linebacker at the
time, stood up and interrupted Burrow.

“Is that really your name?” he

‘asked.

“Well, my real name is James, but
everyone calls me Jamie,”
replied.

“He said, ‘That can’t be,’” Burrow
said. “‘We’Ve got to come up with
something better than that.”’

Surely this guy who’s supposed to
terrorize ball carriers couldn’t hold
any intimidating clout with the name
Jamie- ~

Especially if he enjoys wearing
mullet wigs, claims his breakfast of
champions is Doritos and milk and
blares the “Conan the Barbarian”
soundtrack in his car.

So Foreman suggested “The

I Rock,” and it stuck.

The Rock. Not bad. Certainly
more ferocious than Jamie. Certainly
fits better for someone who now leads
the much—improved Blackshirts in
tackles (22 over three games, five for
losses), on-field direction and fiery
motivation. I

And “The Rock” certainly fits bet-
ter for someone whose bone—crushing

0' savage and athletic instinct was shown

best in his fumble recovery on Notre
Dame’s first possession against the
Huskers. ’

The play did more than set up the

touchdown that gave Nebraska a 14-0 _
‘ lead and springboarded it to a 27-10

Victory. It also officially made fans
stop worrying about him replacing
Carlos Polk, last year’s All-American
defensive warrior. -‘
For his career-best ll-tackle per-
formance, Burrow was named the Big
12 defensive player of the week. Not
bad for someone who many felt would
be the weak link of a trio that was

_ already expected to be weak.

“The honor is really well
deserved,” Coach Frank Solich said.
“There was a belief that Jamie would
have a great year because every time
he got opportunities, _he showed it.

And it was great to see it all come 4

together for us in the game against
Notre Dame.” ,

Burrow is now the “quarterback”
of a unit that had its worst results in 10

Burrow '

years last year, but now is second
nationally in rush defense, fourth in
total defense and fourth in turnovers
gained. '

“We used [the criticism] as moti-
vation. [Burrow’s] a great leader,” said
strong-side linebacker Scott Shanle.
“Any time you have somebody in there
at middle linebacker, you look up to
him. He’s calling the shots. This entire
defense respects him. He waited his

turn playing behind Carlos, and now"

he’s going to make the most of his
turn.” " -
But he’s never made the most of
being “The Rock.” One must under-
stand another thing Burrow leads the
team in: sarcasm and don’t-give-a-
crap-ness.

The- ‘easy-going jokester from
Ames, Iowa, the son of former

Nebraska linebacker and current.

Nebraska graduate assistant Jimmy
Burrow, did not care for the nickname.

“I was like, ‘Oh, God, no,”’ said
Burrow, whose brother\Dan is a red-

shirt freshman safety- on the team.»

“But, it kind of ‘stuck from there.
Coach Bohl is really the only ‘person
that still calls me that every time. But
that’s fine—it’s grown on me. Anyone
that calls me that outside of football is
doing it sarcastically. ‘My ' girlfriend
will call me that on occasion and just
die laughing. I think‘ it’s’ kind of
funny.” I ' V
No, people think you’re funny,
Jamie. '
“Everyone just thinks I’m strange
altogether, I think,” Burrow said. “I

think it’s just because I do my own,

thing, and I may look like a dork and
foolish doing it, but that’s just part of
me. I have a different style than most
people. It borders on the sarcastic side,
but is humorous nonetheless.”

Part of Burrow is showing up to
team movie showings wearing a mullet
wig under his stocking cap. He was
also a frequent visitor of the Web site
mulletsgalore.com.

“He’s out of that phase now,”

Shanle said. ' 

Part of Burrow is wearing hideous
leather shoes that look like bowling
shoes. I ' ,

Part of Burrow is his dog that he
takes for swims in the Centennial Mall
fountains when his family visits.

Part of Burrow is his eating habits,

particularly his famous Wild Doritos’ ,

and skim milk. ‘
“I don’t think there’s a better meal than
that on the planet,” he said.

-And part of Burrow is his wise-one
musicphilosophy:

Burrow adds colorful personality

He’s gone through several bizarre
style changes—from food to music to
clothes to hairstyles that range from
long and scraggly to bald to his current

afro.”
But there are two parts of Burrow

One is that this weirdo is no idiot
— he’s made the Big 12’s honor roll as

a biological science major every year

— and he certainly is no jerk.

“He’s probably the easiest guy on
the team to get along with,” Shanle
said. “If you didn’t know Jamie, you
would automatically get along with
him. That’s just Jamie. He likes to get
along with everybody.”

The part of Burrow that is most
appreciated is his on—field personality.
He’s not kidding around when he
straps on his helmet.

“He’s provided a great deal of
leadership,’’ said Bohl, now

“Sometimes if you sit down and talk to
Jamie, you may have a sense that he’s
