Former Pitt student  
on trial for murder

Former Pitt student Matthew Kaguyutan is on trial for mur-
der this week for the Sept. 29, 2000, ﬁre that killed Pitt senior
Joseph Marcinek.

City police allege that Kaguyutan, 23, set ﬁre to an apartment
building on North Craig Street in a jealous rage directed at a for-
mer girlfriend, Carissa Probst The Gettysburg, Pa, native has
remained in Allegheny County Jail since an October county coro-
ner’s hearing found suﬂicient evidence for a trial.

During the inquest. Probst testiﬁed that Kaguyutan had
stalked her for months leading up to the ﬁre in the building where
both she and Marcinek had lived. Probst knew Marcinek only in

passing.

ting the crime shortly after the ﬁre claimed Marcinek’s life.

But according to Gary Gerson, Kaguyutan’s attorney, no such
confession took place.

“I’m telling you he didn’t confess,” Gerson said in October.
“He was coerced” _

Held in the newly renovated
Masonic Temple Ballroom, Pitt’s Board
of Trustees met June 28 to enact a new
name, new tuition fees and new mem-
bers.

A new name
To honor outgoing Board chair J .W.
Connolly, the Board first resolved to

rename the ballroom the “J .W. Connolly‘

Ballroom.” ‘ The resolution cited
Connolly’s “outstanding leadership,”
contributions to the “rebirth of the
Oakland campus including the construc-
tion of  Bouquet Gardens  the Multi-
Purpose Academic Complex and the
John M. and Gertrude E. Petersen Events
Center” and his “vigorous” and “ur1t.ir-
ing” work during last year’s $500 million
fund—raising campaign.

Connolly couldn’t attend the meeting
because he was recovering from knee

' surgery.

The resolution concludes by calling
the renaming a “symbol of the high
regard in which [Connolly] is held by his
many friends and colleagues at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Connolly will remain an active
Board member, but will be replaced as
chairman by Wﬂliam S. -Dietrich II, chair-
man of Dietrich Industries Inc. and presi-
dent of the investment company Mallard
Fund. Dietrich is a former U.S. Marine
and attended Princeton University for his
undergraduate work, attaining his mas-
ter’s and doctoral degrees at Pitt.

Connolly stirred controversy and a
philosophical distancing by the chancel-
1or’s ofﬁce after he testiﬁed in 1999 that
his “problem” was that “the gay and les-
bian lifestyle is a different lifestyle.” He
also said he would have a problem with
homosexual child-care givers, unless he
could be sure they wouldn’t try to con-
vince the children to partake in their
lifestyle.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg told
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the next day

that he did not share Connolly’s views .

and that they did not inﬂuence University
policy.

In a press release, Nordenberg
praised Connolly, calling him a ‘‘valuable
source of wisdom, integrity and guid-

ance,” saying he was glad the former

senior vice president of H.J. Heinz Corp.
will remain -active on the Board.

New -fees I I
Despite a protest outside on Fifth

0 Avenue before the meeting, the Board 

passed this year’s budget —— including a
7.5 percent tuition hike —— without inci-

dent.

Justifying the jump with increased
salary and ﬁnancial aid spending, and
blaming a dearth of flmding from the
commonwealth, the Board passed the
budget unanimously. A University press
release said the increase — at double the
rate of inﬂation — is necessary to “con-
tinue excellence in teaching [and]

research.” It also ‘noted that the increase 

in state funding was only 1.2 percent.

' Several of the students from the ear-
lier demonstration staged a silent protest
while the budget was passed, walking out
on the meeting to a phalanx of reporters.

Former Student Government Board
member Jay Dworin was one of the
protesting students.

“[This _is a] serious rnisprioritiza- '

tion,” he said. ‘‘[The Board is] prioritiz-
ing top-level administrators and corpora-
tions. The University leaves students way
far behind.” .

SGB President Jeff Alex did not
attend the rally or the Board meeting.

In a later interview, Alex said he I

opposed the tuition hike. “I do not think
it’s a great idea,” he said. ‘‘I think stu-
dents are getting hurt in the process.”
While none of the new SGB mem-
bers attended either meeting, Alex was

quick to say the blame for the increase is '

primarily the commonwealth’s.

In order to combat a similar increase
caused by a lack of fimding next yeag
Alex said he and SGB will be lobbying in
Harrisburg, Pa., in the fall. “The spring
was too late,” he said of last-minute anti-
tuition-hike efforts. .

‘ 0‘ He also reported SGB member
Kevin Washo Jr. is continuing his work
on his Scholarship Resource Guide and
that SGB will be working to educate stu-

dents about financial aid and the accom- I

panying deadlines in the fall.

Seven new members

The Board elected six men to tradi-
tional trustee seats, and Trustee Gov. Tom
Ridge appointed a seventh after a parting
message from Connolly.

In a taped message, Connolly joking-’

ly referred to Executive Vice Chancellor
Jerome Cochran as the “University

Rottweiler” and said a trustee must.v_pos-  ,"
sess three things‘ —— “inﬂuence, afﬂuence .

and a passion for the University.” He , ,
praised the University, saying it is a , ‘ '
“great example of something that. ain’t 2 *

broke — so let’s not try to ﬁx it.”

He concluded by warning the new A _
inductees and the rest of the Board- 1
against the perils of making decisions by V‘ 
committee and ‘instructed incoming  - V 
chairman Dietrich of his duty to protec  T

the chancellor. -

“If ever arrows are aimed at the  _' 
chancellor,” he said in a mock  g I

Pitt to offer emergency
contraception in advance

and seeing it through to its completion as a A

SHANNON VMCLAUGHLIN

Editor in Chief

Senior Amy Benson has spent her Pitt
career pursuing a bachclor’s degree in
anthropology, certiﬁcates in women’s and
East Asian studies and success in lobbying
Student Health Services to prescribe emer-
gency contraceptive pills to women in
advance.

When she graduates in December, all
of her goals will have been realized. The
ﬁrst was achieved June 27, when officials
at the University’s Student Health Services

assented to Students for Reproductive.

Frcedom’s demands and drafted a revised
policy concerning the prescription of emer-
gency contraceptive pills.

Under the new policy, Student Health
will now prescribe women emergency con-
traceptive pills at their request — before
emergency need. Students with an emer-
gency need will be provided with a same-
day appointment, which will include a con-
sultation and pregnancy test.

The Student Health Services pharmacy
will stock three brands of therpills available
with a prescription. “Plan B,” the most
effective option, includes a free homc-preg-
nancy test and costs approximately $23.

Pitt alum, community organizer and
activist J anct Syphan, Benson and others
who have been lobbying for ﬂue contracep-
tives since fall 1998 hail the policy as a step
forward for women carnpus-wide.

“We got about everything we wanted
—- and more,” Syphan said.

Benson agreed, and after beginning her
work on the project in 1998 as a ‘freshman

senior, said she feels a sense of completion.
' “I’m really excited this project has

happened,” Benson said. Last year, Benson .

served as ‘Students for Reproductive
Freedom’s legislative director, and will
remain an active member until she gradu-
ates. 9

Emergency contraceptive pills are
used to prevent pregnancy — up to 72

‘hours after unprotected sexual intercourse

G

— by preventing ovulation or thickening

the lining of a woman’s uterus so that it _

becomes impenetrable to sperm.
Syphan stressed that such medicine

‘does not cause an abortion, but acts rather

as a contraceptive agent. Studies in the
New England Journal of Medicine have
found that after pregnancy, emergency con-
traceptives arc ineffective. _

Syphan said that prescription of emer-
gency contraceptive pills has been incon-

sistent in the past. She cited a lack of poli-

cy, saying that Studcnt Health Services has-
n’t produced any written policy when
asked.

“There was a policy,” said Pitt
spokesman Robert Hill. “I don’t know if it
was on paper.” V

Syphan said that without a formalized A

policy, women were at the mercy of specif- '

ic physicians, some of whom might pro-
vide the pills, some of whom might not.
This is what spurred three years of lobbying
for. the preemptive prescriptions.

Benson is proud of the work shc’s'

done for Students for Reproductive
Freedom.

“[Now]’l can move on and really feel
like I made a difference here,” Benson said.

introducing any big changes.
“I will be taking a fresh look at

. everything. Not ‘everything will change,

but it’s an opportunity to improve
things,” Johnson said in an interview last
spring. .
Before coming to Pitt, Johnson
gained experience in student affairs at

Slippery Rock University and Wichita-

State University in Kansas. She holds a
doctorate in college ‘student personnel
administration.’

In a March 2000 memo announcing
Johnson’s acceptance of the position of
dean of students, Maher applauded
Johnson’s record of accomplishments
and expressed faith in her abilities.

“I have great conﬁdence that Dr.
Johnson will provide the leadership nec-
essary to integrate student and academic
affairs throughout the campus,” he wrote
in the memo.

Alan Lesgold, dean of the School of
Education, said the "school “welcomes
[Johnson] as a colleague and hopes her
presence will help us expand our service
to the many people in the region whopare
involved in student affairs work at Pitt
and other colleges.’’ ' ' . ,

During this period of transitional
leadership, Pack said the ‘Office of
Student Affairs will remain focused on

“building -closer relationships between ‘ a

student affairs and academic affairs.”

He said students should not antici-
pate significant changes in the way they
receive services from the Ofﬁce of
Student Affairs. .

“Frankly, I think students will in
most instances not notice [the change in
leadership], and when they do, see that
we continue to do things better and bet
ter,” he said. V

Pack’s goals include using programs
such as Pitt Pathways, a facet of Career
and Placement Services that combines

Hill commented that the transition
“gives the University an opportunity to
provide a holistic approach to educating
the undergraduate students at Pitt.”
While serving as interim dean of stu-

dents, Daniel will continue hisduties as -

vice provost of academic affairs.

, “He is supported by a staff of very
dedicated Pitt people,” Hill said. “He’ll
make the time.” .

Daniel, who is working on a writing
project during his time away from the
University, could not be reached for
comment. ,

EDITORIAL  
can the Trustees be trusted?

Perhaps many Pitt students have
long felt that the administration is unre-
sponsive to our needs. Events of the
last few weeks have helped demon-
strate this. _

On July 2, Vice Provost and Dean
of Students Sharon Johnson, who
served in that post for only a year,
accepted a position in the School of
Education. ,

The details of her transfer are sus-
piciously sparse. VV1th Johnson’s
departure, there will only be one
woman vice provost out of six.

The lack of diversity of Pitt’s
administration is even more apparent in
the Board of Trustees. _

The Board, which makes most of
the important decisions for the
University, is truly a “good ol’ boys”

-club. Of the 4] members listed in last

year’s University factbook, ﬁve were
women. One has since ended her term,
so now there are only four. The Board’s
racial —-— and age — diversity is almost
nonexistent‘.

Among the faculty,-athere is also a
stunning lack of gender and racial
diversity. In total, 693 faculty members
are women while 1,082 are men; more
s_trikingly, 814 men — but only 424
women — enjoy full-time status. Only .
193 faculty members are minorities.

Outgoing Board chairman J . Wray
Connolly has said in the past that its
members needed, among other things, .
inﬂuence and aﬂluence. But perhaps
that aﬁluence makes the Board unre-
ﬂective of the student body.

.for his homophobic remarks during a

The Board has no student mem-
bers,unlikeithasinﬂ1epast.

‘In the same June 28’meeting in
which the Board raised tuition 7.5 per-
cent, it named the Masonic Temple
ballroom the J .W. Connolly Ballroom.

In 1999, Connolly made headlines

deposition concerning the same-sex
beneﬁts lawsuit. '

' At the time, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg attempted to distance him-
self and the University ﬁom
Connolly’s remarks. But after the
Board’s decision on naming the ball-
room, the chancellor had nothing but

’ praise for him

The Board’s resolution stated that
renaming the room for Connolly is “a
symbol of the high regard in which he
is held by his many ﬁiends and col-

leagues at the University of
Pittsburgh.” ~
But after his unacceptable

remarks, we, the diverse student body,

' do not hold him in high regard.

Unfortunately, bringing a business
style of operation to the University was
among the things for which
Nordenberg praised Connolly. But a

‘university is an educational institution,

not a business. .

The administration and students
should be working together; we should
not have to be engaged in constant bat-
tle. But right now, only certain students
can speak to the Board.

.We should all have access. Our
futures are on the line.

To: The Press
From: IsenNetwork Studios
Subject: Forthcoming productions

Hugs and love ﬁom Hollywood. We wanted
to give all of you A&E darlings out there a sneak
preview of our exhilarating fall lineup.

Our Development Team has dedicated some

' extra hours to the Idea Room, and we think the

product is just fabulous. VVith new

morning with the kids to prime
time, IsenNetwork TV has just
experienced’ a refreshing
makeover. — 
Here’s just a hint of what’s to come:
“Dewey the Killer Bee” —— This cartoon

' series stars Dewey, the simple honeybee, who

one day confused a nuclear power plant for his

V hive. Now he has morphed into an 8 foot tall

armor-plated Killer" Bee (trademarked), whose
sole purpose is to destroy Halgor, King of the
Interspacial Hornets (trademarked).

Featuring the animation skills of several tal--

ented Bennington Art School grads, Dewey’s
morphed stinger ﬁres laser beams that actually
seem to shoot out of the screen. For a limited
time, 3-D glasses will be supplied at participating
convenience stores. Each episode is followed by
a short lesson, such as “How to treat bee stings,”
“Where honey comes from” and “How to morph
your dog.” . _

‘Molten Danger” —-— This game show will
replace its predecessor, “Bright Lights/Big
Money.” Contestants must answer questions and
solve puzzles, or else wade across a vat of lique-
ﬁed marshmallow. -

“WaldtschiHer’s Massage ' ” — This isn’t
so much a show as a daily infomercial. Program
features several “Baywatch” alumni. It will air
every day, including weekends, from 1 to 5 p.m.

“Isenberg!” — This talk show will feature

‘our egomaniacal CEO, who Time praised as

“capable of talking, and in that way warranting a
talk show.” He will interview a wide variety of
unusual people with shocking relationships and
sex-abuse problems. .

drama explores the lives of cops and mobsters
who have all been shot and are about to die in the
ER of a very large, unnamed Boston hospital.
These last moments are recorded with hand-held
cameras and lots of close-ups on the characters’
gushing tears. Many Emmy awards are anticipat-
ed.

“The News Hour with Bill Billingsly” —
Bill Bﬂlirrgsly needs no introductions. Author of
the book “The Power and the
Fury and the State of
International Capitalism,”
Billingsly has been asking the
hard-hitting questions for
decades.

Renowned for making several heads of state
weep furiously, he has won accolades ﬁom other
hardass journalists who wish they could be just
like him. Tom Brokaw once said, “Bill is a mem-
ber of my generation. That’s why he roc .”

“The Cerebral Program” — This show is
hosted by several renowned Rhodes Scholars,
each of whom is old and gray and wears a black
suit. They sit in plush English studies and talk
about something. VV1sh we could tell you what,
but we always fall asleep.

“Late Night with *TBA*” —— We’re not sure
who will host this show, or who will lead the
(exhilarating) accompanying jazz band. We con-
sidered J ack Iemmon, but we’ve had troubl
reaching him. ’

“Life with Sheri” — The life of Sheri, a
writer living in the Upper East Side. She ﬂirts
with dieting in the ﬁrst season, then decides not
to. The rest of the show is spent watching Sheri
debate what to order in restaurants. She also will
read the New Yorker and wave to friends through
the window. Wrlliarn Shatner will cameo in the
pilot as a wily taxi driver.

“Sexxy Nubile Graduate Students 2002”'—
This show aims to not only deliver cheap porn to
desperately alienated postindustrial viewers, but
also provide employment opportunities for grad-

uate students and out-of-work techno artists.

Program will feature lots of wild bedroom scenes.

VVEDNE_SfDAY, JULY 11, 2001

I’m suffering‘ from writer’s block, a
potentially‘ life—threatening disorder for a
penniless English major entering the rat
race. So I decided to get back to nature,
hoping that the great outdoors would
ignite my creative ﬁre.

It worked for Hemy David Thoreau,
didn’t it?

\V1th a brown bag lunch,

some sharpened pencils and a KRISTY

notebook in tow, I set out for

Schenley Park. GRAVER
Flagstaﬂ Hill isn’t exact-

ly Walden Pond, but it’s the
closest thing to an ecosystem that Oakland
has to offer. I pick a plot of grass, slip off
my sandals and hunker down for an inten-
sive writing session. The summer air is
sweet and warm.

Surely the Muse will ﬁnd me here
among the leafy trees, fragrant ﬂowers and
hot, sweaty boys playing touch football on
the lawn. Their bodies glisten with...
Damn. My concentration is broken and I
must relocate.

I ﬁnd a large cement slab by a vacant
ball ﬁeld and lean against the fence. I take
out my notebook and press pencil to paper,
ready to write pages upon pages of elo-
quent, free ﬂowing prose. After ﬁve brain-
numbing minutes I produce one word,
“The.”

Discouraged, I scan the landscape for
ideas, anything that will trigger a burst of
inspired genius.

A bright orange butterﬂy ﬂutters
around me like an autumn leaf on a gentle
breeze. It settles itself on my bare leg and
sits there slowly ﬂapping its wings in time
with my breathing. I am caught up in the
serenity of the moment.

This is my Muse! It’s so beautiful and
pure and OWWW! Suddenly, I feel a
stinging pain. The little sucker bit me, or
proboscised me, or whatever it is butter-
ﬂies do when they’re hungry.

I swat it from my leg. It hovers a
moment, deciding its next
course of action, then lunges for
my head. From the comer of my eye
I can see it ﬂapping wildly, nesting in my
hair, becoming more entangled with every
beat of its silky wings. ,

I don't lash out for fear of strik-
ing to hard and splattering bug juice

in my long locks. Instead, I try to ;.

dislodge the intruder by ﬂipping
my  wildly in a heavy-meta-
lesque head bang.

Finally, the winged heathen is 
freed from its keratin chains and '
takes a few dizzying laps
around my head before ﬂying
away.

“Go back to your freakin’ cocoon,
jerk!” I scream, shaking my ﬁst.

People are staring at me. I must look
like a mental patient having a ﬁt. I want to
explain to them that I just had a horrifying

S'I:\r~'|-' \VRl'l‘l£R

before a whole swarm of the evil, blood-
sucking insects swoop out of the sky and
start devouring them.

I stare down at my notebook Alittle
black ant darts by my pencil point like a
living letter ﬂeeing the page. I am per-
turbed by the irony of it and slam my note-
book shut. I reopen it to ﬁnd the trespasser
reduced to nothing more than
a brown smudge.

“Ha ha! Take that, bug!”
I cackle.

The smile dissolves from
my face as I watch an entire
army of ants mobilize around me, mourn-
ing the loss of their fallen comrade. Before
they can carry me away as a sacriﬁcexfor
their queen, I begin ﬂicking them, one-by-

. one, into the grassy jungle, far away from

their colony headquarters. Finally, I dip
into my amateur exterminator arsenal and
smash them, en masse, with my shoe.

My stomach rumbles. All this bug
killing is rrraking me hungry. I devour a
PB&J sandwich and take big gulps from
my bottle of Pepsi One. Silly me, how did
I expect to create a literary masterpiece on
an empty stomach?

I then set my drink down and retum to
my notebook When I-go to reach for it
again, I spy a tiny, metallic bug perched
precarziously on the lip of the bottle.

It peers into the abyss with its bulging
bug eyes and, as I attempt a quick, futile
grab, plummets antennae first into the
ﬁzzy, one-calorie cola. A kamikaze beetle.

I feel defeated and decide that rough-
ing it on the lawn is hampering my cre-
ative spirit. I gather my things and head for
the library.

I ﬁnd an empty table in the courtyard
and sit down to write. Nothing comes to
mind.

Moments later a fat pigeon struts
underneath my seat, winding its way
around my legs, cooing and clucking and
serenading my feet. It pecks

'”\'\..V

,.

Bugging out inthe great outdoors

with a reﬂexive kick.
Back to the notebook. I rub my fore-

head, trying to squeeze an idea from my -

brain. _

A small, brown ﬁnch hops over to my
table and chirps merrily. I smile at it, reach
into my lunch bag and shower it with some
sandwich bread crumbs. It whistles a high-
pitched “Thank you!”

Suddenly, the evil foot-pecking
pigeon returns. It attacks the ﬁnch with the
ferocity of a Rottweiler, gobbles the
crumbs and ﬂies away before I can retali-
ate. ’
It lands just barely out of my reach
and pecks at the ground, picking up an old
cigarette butt. It looks like a schoolyard
bully: chest stuck out deﬁantly, cigarette
dangling ﬁom its hooked beak.

I stand up and head for home.
Forgetting that my Pepsi One is now a
watery grave, I take a swig of the luke-
warm beverage. As I chug, I see the little
carcass bobbing up and down like a buoy
on sea of soda.

I spit out the liquid and run to my
apartmentlin disgust. Once there, I plop
down on my couch thinking about all of
the errvironmental injustices that befell me
during my!‘ quest for literary inspiration.

Then, as willed! by _some great eight- .
legged Muse, I begin to’ write about my

creepy-crawly antagonists. .
This organic experience pulled me ou
of a writing deadlock, refueling me 

, creative energy.

Halfway through adaptations of “Romeo and Juliet,” I
always ﬁnd myself hoping that the director will have found some
new yet equally cathartic method of ending the tale; yet I am
always disappointed when this does not happen. '

OK, so it’s, easy to become wrapped up in ﬁlms and books
and the images" they portray, perhaps now more than ever. But
still, the escape that they offer is so comfortable!

I recently read an interview with Julia Roberts by Billy
Crystal. He asked her a typical interview question about how she
related to a mean-spirited character she had played in her earlier
days. She replied that she hadn’t relatedto that character at all,
but that she thought people (fans) consider celebrities to be the
personas they represent on camera, much more so than in the
past,

Julia, I would have to say I agree with you. ‘

I have a cartoon taped to my cubicle at work One of m
friends drew it, and the two robots in the foregroundhave a little
conversation. ' ‘

First robot: When I look at something that I think is beauti-

p ful, I say it looks like a photograph. - _
Second robot: When my life is funny or interesting, it’

reminds me of a movie.

Sadly enough, I ﬁnd myself making comments like this
more often than I wish I did.

My father is in the midst of his rnid-life crisis and recently
purchased a vintage Mercedes—Benz to help him enjoy his job
more. When I rode in it for the ﬁrst time, I looked at my reﬂec-
tion in the quaint side mirror as the wind blew through my hair.

I smiled and said, “I feel as though I am in a French movie from _

the late ‘70s.”

My dad agreed with me. .

I had no real grounds for making that silly comment. It’s not
like I said, “I feel like I’m driving down the Champs Elysees in

.a European car.” I directly associated my real-life experience

with a ﬁctional one. ~ _-

The other evening, I walked out of a ﬁlm so good that I felt
uneasily as though I was still “in” the movie as my boyfriend and
I walked to my car. ' ,

We saw “Memento,” the ﬁlm about the man who can’t make
any new memories, and- joked to ourselves, “Oh, where’s the
car?” as we walked across the street. .

Perhaps this “pretending I’m in a movie” condition is some-
thing only I admit to, but I’m pretty sure others have experienced
it as well. I

At least that’s what Julia and Billy tell me.

 

Jill Palemto, a senior ﬁne arts major at
Carnegie Mellon University, has applied
her interest in metalwark to creating unique
copper; silver and gold pendants, bracelets
and earrings, which she is selling this sum-
mer at Ohio art festivals. While she consid-
ers herself to be primarily a painter, she
views selling her jewelry at art festivals as a

fun way to make money during the summer

The Pitt News: Why are you making jew-
elry? ’

Jill Palermo: It’s kind of .a funny thing
because I’m very surprised that I’m doing
jewelry right now. I don’t see it as a future
career path, but it’s something I enjoy doing
for the time being and it’s something to
bring in money for college. But I’m really
more of a painter.

TPN: So how exactly did you get started?
Palermo: Well, my mom is an artist. Last
summer I helped her with some of her art
shows —— she’s a painter — and while I was
there, I would see other artists at the festi-
vals and look at their work, and I realized
that I could do it, too. There was nothing
holding me back; it’s a pretty good way to
make money, as long as you have some-
thing that’s marketable, and it’s a fun way to
spend the summer. ll‘

TPN:- How did you decide to work with
metal? .

Palermo: I took this class called Small
Metals at CMU. It’s not the jewelry [I like],
it’s the metal. I could get my hands on mate-
rials, and my professor was really helpful in
guiding me to catalogues to buy supplies.
So I ordered a whole bunch of materials and
I played with them and tried to come up
with my own style, and it kind of evolved
into what it is. The name‘ of my business is
called The Copper Onion now, because pri-
marily I use copper, and second, a lot of sil-

' ver. And then I use bits of gold also.

Heavy metalis a jeweler’sbest friend  

TPN: Have -you just been making jewelry
since last summer? ‘
Palermo: No, actually, I started over

Christmas break. Iordered materials over .

Thanksgiving break, because I thought of
the idea over the summer. During fall
semester I was taking classes in all sorts of
media, and I thought I would take the
experience I liked the most and turn it
into a business for the next summer,
and sell at these art festivals.
Surprisingly, most college stu-

dents don’t knowthat these festivals
are open to them. It usually is about a $100
to $300 entrance fee, but beyond that, it’s
pure proﬁt — taxes excluded. But I was sur-
prised that none of the art students never
thought of itas an option.-

TPN: So have you been to any art festivals
yet?
Palermo: Yes. I went to one so far in

.Moreland Hills, this town outside of
_ Cleveland. It was only one day. It was very A

interesting; I had good responses for my
work, but there weren’t as many people

there as ‘had been predicted. It was very"

slow. I was pleased though. A gallery owner
was there, and we’ve been talking. She’s
going to put some of my pieces in her
gallery [outside of Cleveland].

TPN: How do you ﬁnd out about art
shows? . a , '

Palermo: In a publication called “Sunshine
Artists.” There are publications [for] this
whole breed of people, these, traveling
artists, who do these festivals. The festival
at Moreland Hills was also a horse show
and a dog show. If you’ve ever seen a dog
show, it’s the most hilarious thing in the

"world. Then tl1ere’s people singing, and

there’s people walking around with food.
It’s not elitist art at all. It’s more like folk art,
and it’s fun to do. .

TPN: Your designs have a deﬁnite style to

them. What would you say is your inspira-
tion for them? I ,

Palermo: It sort of evolved. I call them
“rustic wear” because it’s sort of rustic-
looking, and I don’t really enjoy making
pristine jewelry. I like jewelry that looks

‘like it has alhistory and is more like a piece.

of art than a cookie-cutter shape. I kind
of look for the process. Some of

A [the pieces] have different colors

associated withﬂrem. I

TPN: How long does it normally
take you to make, say, a necklace?
Palermo: If I’m working in an assembly

line, 20 minutes.

TPN: Do you‘ start outwith plans of how
you want it to turn out?
Palermo: Deﬁnitely more free-spirited.

TPN: What have you learned ﬁom 
~ jewelry? _ p ‘ —
Palermo: One thing I’ve learned is
patience. I’ve never been in a huge supply ,

of patience, and working with such small
materials, and having to wait and be patient
with the ﬁre, it’s been really good to learn to
work slowly and work small. ’

TPN: How long do you plan to continue?
Palermo: That’s a question I’m wondering,
too. [l_.aughter.] I have 400 pieces in my

inventory,. and -I have plenty of supplies to-
make 400 more. So I’m deﬁnitely going to .
use those supplies to make 400 more pieces, . ’
and then I’m going to go to art festivals until "

I run out of supplies, or contact more gal-
leries andtry to get into those. I’m only
doing three art festivals this summer and a
couple over winter break I '

The Pitt News .

For those fed up with the sum-
mer’s extremes of drenching rain and
scorching sun, take a trip to Regent

‘Square and experience a juxtaposi-

tion" of a more ‘appealing type.

The Concept Art Gallery on
South Braddock Avenue is exhibiting
an exceptionally sublime breed of
sculpture — its main ingredient is

metal. The three highlighted artists _

commit themselves to altering the
relationship between the natural
world and that of the synthetic.
Robert Lepper, graduate and one-
time faculty member of the Carnegie
Institute of Technology, set the stage
for industrial sculptu're.’Artists Philip
Pearlstein and Andy Warhol were
both students of Lepper at Carnegie
Tech. His inﬂuence has also reached
many others in the art world.
Lepper’s sculpture is an intrigu-

ing collection of small metal objects ,

that are pieced together in both the
relief and. free-standing forms. His
inﬂuence is clearly mechanical. This
is evident in the" composition of his
work, which is a combination of bits
and pieces of other larger mecha-
nisms. He uses engine parts, frag-

,ments of horns, templates and cranks.

This mechanical design enables the
viewer to imagine each "piece in
motion — transforming from one
shape to the next, essentially achiev-
ing kinesthesis.

Lepper’s work creates a voice for
the machine within nature. His piece
“Peacock” is created out of piano
parts and other metallic gadgets.
From afar the droid-like bird appears
natural and tangibly real with a hint
of ﬂuid motion.

John Van Alstine is an intema-
tionally respected artist who began
his career in rock carvings, referred
to as “subtractive” sculpture. Now his
work is predominantly of the “addi-
tive” technique; He builds with and
from the stone and maneuvers it
along with his steel frames, produc-
ing stunning contradictions.

All of Van. Alstine’s works are

balancing acts between ' metal and
rock. The sculptures create an
uncharacteristically smooth transition.
between glossy metal and rough
stone that always presents itself with
remarkable buoyancy. As a
result, the issue of the
human relationship with
the natural world arises.
The bone and fin shaped
cast bronze is an artificial
object in disguise as a biological one.
The standout sculpture of the
exhibit is the free-standing “Chalice
IV,” made ofi.-aluminum, bronze and
granite. Van Alstine uses the painted
metals to create a rocket-like object,
which appears to be crashing to the
Earth. Its destruction is halted by a
jagged butte that extends from the
granite. “Chalice IV” pays homage to

    

nature’s enduring ability to withstand
anything humans pitch at it.

Margery Amdur is an assistant
professor of painting and drawing at
the University of New Mexico. She
also creates enormous instal-
lations whose primary

focuses are women and
‘femininity. Amdur’s
installation at the Concept
Art Gallery is a frill-filled
room with ﬂoating chandeliers,
chairs, cushions and endless curtains.
What makes this so enthralling is that
they are all made from lace—stenciled
wire and mesh screen. Her art embod-
ies ﬂuidness and natural air.

An eerily beautiful escape from
mainstream free-standing and relief
sculpture, Amdur’s work offers a jux-
taposition between the human and the

,-

natural. N

All three artists have created a
fresh blend of structure and sight,
which combines to form a wonderful
collaboration of human-made and
naturally-found medium.

In addition to this exhibit,
Concept Art Gallery hosts a regular

. collection and lacks an admission fee. I

This clearly makes for a highly
accommodating and aesthetically
pleasing way to spend those muggy
summer afternoons.

The xt nan

Pitt gets verbal commitments from West
AIlegheny’s Tyler Palko and two others

KENNETH PAUL

Sports Editor

West Allegheny High School’s Tyler Palko,
one of the most heavily recruited Western
Pennsylvania quarterbacks in decades, made a
verbal commitment to Pitt.

Palko chose Pitt, shunning such powerhous-
es as Penn State, Virginia and Michigan. The
soon-to-be senior, who is coached by his father,
said his parents left the decision up to him.

“Seeing all the success that those schools
have had in the past is appealing, but I live in
the now and I made my decision based on the
people at Pitt,” Palko said.

The commitment from Palko is yet another
recruiting feather in head coach Walt Harris’
cap. Pitt has been aggressive in letting Palko
know that he was wanted during his sophomore
season, showing its commitment by not recruit-
ing any quarterbacks this year.

“Coach Harris was the big factor, he’s my
kind of coach,” Palko said. “He’s a teacher and
always expects more, and I want to be
coached.”

With current quarterback David Priestley
graduating after this season, Palko might have
the opportunity to compete for the starting role
as a true freshman.

Rod Rutherford, currently a redshirt sopho-

more, has not shown any signs that he is ready
to take over at the helm, and third stringer Pat
Hoderny is also still maturing.

“After our season is over I’d like to sit in on
meetings and learn the offense,” he said. “IfI do
so, he’ll give me the chance, but a lot of people
have a facade that I’ll start right away.” V

Palko already has a national reputation —
he was ranked by Street & Smith’s magazine
among the top 50 players in the nation. He also
received recognition from ESPN .com’s Tom
Lemming.

“I hate the rankings,” Palko said. “That stuff ‘

isn’t big for me. The coaches here care about the
players, not their egos. I could see in their eyes
that they’re here to get the job done and win.”
Palko joins Larry Fitzgerald, a standout
wide receiver from Minnesota, as the founda-
tion for the 2002 recruiting class. Fitzgerald
attends the Valley Forge Military Academy.
“After Larry committed last year, he and I
spoke,” he said. “We’ve become close during
this whole recruiting process, and I know that
I’ll have a lot of fun hooking up with him in the
future. He’s one in a million.” .
Harris’ first real recruiting success was
Valley’s standout running back Brandin
Williams. Moved to linebacker last season,
Williams was the 1998 Pennsylvania Player of

No more Bucs  I’m ready for football

Summer is just not a good time
for me.‘In between NBA Draft Day
and the NFL preseason is this vast,
horribly boring void filled with golf
and baseball.

I don’t care how good Tiger
Woods is, he is not going to get me to
watch golf no matter how much the
networks hype him.

And as for baseball, well, does
anyone even realize there is baseball
in Pittsburgh this summer?

It didn’t take long for the thrill of
shiny new PNC Park to wear off,
leaving us with the painful reality
that the Pirates are still just a Very sad
baseball team.

I at least have to give owner
Kevin McClatchy credit for finally
dumping general manager Cam
Bonifay. Bonifay was around for a
long time, longer than I realized, and,
coincidentally, the Pirates have stunk
for just as long. It’s just too bad
Bonifay didn’t pick up Derek Bell on
his way out. I

So with baseball and golf out,
what does that leave me with?

Speculation, people. Wonderful
speculation. I’m left with no other
option than to rummage through the
scraps of news and rumors that give
me hope that the upcoming Penguins’

and Steelers’ seasons will be better
than the one the Pirates are currently
enduring. ‘

Let’s start with the
Penguins. It’s been pretty
‘easy for me to get caught up
in all these J agr trade rumors.

Where’s he going? The
Rangers? The Caps? The
Kings?

I love hearing all the crazy
rumors, but it seems more and
more likely that he’s not going
anywhere. v V

The Pens aren’t the only
ones that can’t afford him. ..
It’s looking like no team
can.

But with a little luck,
they’ll deal him, get some value and

some cap space in return, and can

then go after someone like Brett Hull.

I know a Hull’-Lemieux combo
doesn’t have quite the same ring as
Jagr-Lemieux, but they’d score a lot

of goals.
Is first-round draft pick Colby
Armstrong another Matthew

Barnaby? I hope so. The Pens need a
pest to get under the opposition’s
skin.

‘Is Johan Hedberg the next Patrick
Roy? ' .

   
   
  
  

Shaun UI'iffl'l1

Penguins management isn’t ready
to believe that yet and is offering

“The Moose” a two way contract,

which offers more money if

Hedberg proves to be
  a major leaguer and

" * less if he comes down
 with a touch of the Brian
‘ Boucher ﬂu. Q

If the Pens can deal
Jagr and sign all those
free agents, I think last
year’s magic will carry
oven‘

If they can’t,
they’ll have proba-
bly the two best
players in the world
and not much else. We’ll
see what happens.

As for the Steelers, first off, good
choice on Heinz Field. I feared
watching all the games from
Galleryfurniture.com Stadium or
something. My early nickname idea
for the stadium was “The Squirt.”
Any takers? ‘

I like the quarterback ‘situation a
little more than I did at this time last
year. Kordell Stewart looked rejuve-
nated at the end of the season, so
Kent Graham can stay right on the

bench where he belongs.

Maybe Tee Martin will finally get '

some snaps this year. Maybe Tommy
Maddox proved in the XFL that he
belongs in the NFL. I don’t really
know since neither myself nor any-
one else ever watched him in the
XFL. ‘

Well, whoever it is, he’ll have an
offensive line in front of him that
should be much better with the addi—-
tion of Jeff Hartings. Bettis’.numbers
should be even better this year behind
that line. _

It’s looking like the defense is
going to take ahit with the loss of
Levon Kirkland and with the signings
of the backs still pending. But we’ll
see what former Ram Mike Jones can
do. -
And _ expect Josh Miller 'to
become an Al1—World inside-the—.5-
every-time punter, because he should
be with the money he’s going to make
this year. _

Well, there you have it. No golf,
no baseball, no substance. Just a ram-
bling summertime column to get you
thinking about the fall.

Shaun Griﬁin is a columnist for the‘

Pitt News. He dares you to think of a
"better stadium nickname than “The
Squirt.”

Athlon College Football, Lindy’s
College Football, Preview Sports,

A Collegefootbal1news.com have all recog-

nized Bryant. .
‘ The Sporting News and Lindy’s
touted Bryant as the best wide receiver in

with many other publications named him
as a top Heisman Trophy candidate.

Bryant racked up seven triple-digit
receiving yardage performances in 2000,
including a career-high 222 yards vs.
Boston College. He also caught 13
touchdowns.

Bryant helped lead the Panthers to
their ‘most successful season in more

Last year’s top recruit was’

Central Bucks West fullback Dustin
Piccioti, who should serve as an intri-
cate part of the offense this season.
Piccioti was preceded by Rutherford,
who was recruited as an extremely
athletic quarterback from Perry
Traditional Academy- 6 A
Palko, who will be a senior at
West Allegheny, can’t sign a_ binding
letter of intent until February. Pitt
officials cannot comment on Pa1ko’s
commitment until that time. 2
The addition of the local star is
comparable to many Pitt signings of
the past, such’ as when the team

signed Aliquippa’s Sean Gilbert, Penn
Hills’ Bill Fralic and Central
Catholic’s Dan Marino.

Palko islisted at 6 feet 3 inches,

212 pounds, and has run the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds. He also plays
free safety, but he has been recruited
solely as a quarterback.

Palko startedat quarterback since
the beginning of his freshman year for
West Allegheny. In that time, the team
accumulated a 35-5 record. Although
the team relies on a balanced running
attack, Palko passed for 3,666 yards
in his three seasons. He also rushed
for 1,053 yards.

_ - The 2002 Pitt football recruiting
class has been bumped -up from two
commitments to ‘four, as two players

from Massillon High School in Ohio .

verbally committed to Pitt. 

Andy Alleman, a linebacker, and
fullbacker_David Abdul both decided
to attend-Pitt. Like Palko and all other
scholastic athletes, Alleman and
Abdul cannot sign a binding letter of
intent until February.

Alleman is '6 feet 5 inches, weighs
235 pounds and will probably settle
down on the defensive line at Pitt.
Alleman ‘received offers from several
large schools, including Ohio State,
Michigan, Tennessee and West
Virginia, but opted for Pitt.

swings with bursts of high energy that alternate with
very low moods and periods of depression. UPMC

the effectiveness of a study medication on reducing
drinking and controlling manic-depression episodes.
