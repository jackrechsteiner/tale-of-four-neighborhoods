Pitt study connects

Depression is in your genes, and they
are possibly the same genes that shorten
your life span, according to Pitt researcher
George S. Zubenko. M.D., Ph.D. '

There are 19 locations on chromo-
somes, where the genes reside, that inﬂu-

. ence susceptibility to depressive disorders,

reported Zubenko, a professor of psychia-
try at Pitt and an adjunct professor of bio-
logical sciences at Carnegie Mellon
University, this surmner. A

One particular gene, CREB 1, was

. identiﬁed in Zubenko’s study as a gene

common in families with early—onset,
major depressive disorder, or RE-MDD.
In a study last year, Zubenko reported that
the ‘same gene was present in women who
suffer from depression. The recent study
surveyed 81 families with RE-MDD and
found that deceased family membershad
died, on average, eight years younger than
the general population. ‘More than 40 per-
cent died before the age of 65. .

Zubenkoreported that, although drug-

and alcohol addictions were also common

within the families, their deaths were not
disproportionately higher from addiction-
related illnesses.

Deaths in the RE-MDD families were
proportional to the deaths from illnesses
that commonly affect the general popula-
tion — like heart disease — but in a sig-
niﬁcantly higher concentration.

Zubenko concluded that depression-

‘ causing genes could be some of the same I
that cause other illnesses, because the

genes that he researched were activated all
over the body, and not just in the head.
For example, CREB 1 in the heart
could also cause heart disease —— not just
depression, according to Zubenko. .
Although he supports looking at
genes or biology, instead of environment,
as a way of detecting depression, he sug-
gests seeing depression as an individual
illness for every sufferer. Zubenko takes
into account genetic markers within indi-
viduals so they “may respondbetter to
particular current treatments than others.”
The ability to fully, map out genes

related to depression is, according to’

THE PITT NEWS

According to a 1998 law commonly
known as the Clery Act, all post—sec—
ondary schools receiving federal ﬁnancial
assistance are required to provide an
annual statistical report, “timely reports”
regarding crimes that present an ongoing
threat to the campus community, and a
daily campus crime log. The log must be
available for public inspection. The Pitt
News will publish the crime log twice a
week, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays.

The log must include all crimes
reported to the campus police; these
crimes include any that occur on campus,
on a noncampus building or property, on
public property or within the patrol juris-
diction of the campus police. The Pitt
News either prints, or publishes online, a

selection from the log in the Police

Blotter. All crimes in which a person is
named will be run when possible.

A person’s name will appear in the
log only if he or she is cited or arrested.
The police are required by law to include
the names of every person who receives a
citation or who is arrested. The police log
does not include the name of any victim,
and The Pitt News will not publish the
name of a victim in the Police Blotter.

If you are cleared of charges after
your name has run in the Police Blotter, e-
mail your name, address, charge and date
of the blotter publication to The Pitt News
at news@pittnews.com. Once the infor-
mation is veriﬁed, The Pitt News will
publish an armouncement of the clearing.

Zubenko, still “a decade away.”

Zubenko hopes his research will lead
to the development of new drugs to treat
depression. His hope comes at a time
when antidepressant drugs, such as Paxil,
are under scrutiny by the national and
international medical community, not
only for being ineffective, but for causing
harm, as well. Officials recently limited
the prescription of Paxil such that it would
be available only to adults 18 years and
older, due to its link with increased teen
suicides, an article in The New York
Times reported earlier this month.

About 150 million people responded
positively to taking antidepressant drugs
in 2000, according to the The

Antidepressant Sourcebook. Those who
are treated for depression will be healthier
than if they are left untreated, Zubenko
said, adding that people who receive treat-
ment are more likely to think clearly and,
consequently, go to their doctor when they
need medical attention. Most RE-MDD
sufferers have their first episode by age
18.

According to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
depression is deﬁned as two weeks of
depressed mood plus a number of signs
and symptoms, such as disturbances in
sleep and/or appetite, as well as feelings of
worthlessness, guilt, and suicidal feelings
and/or actions. Anyone experiencing such
symptoms should call or visit a psychia-
trist immediately, Zubenko said.

Should we be aligned with the USSA?

Student Government Board’s —
and, by extension, every Pitt student’s
— membership in the United States
Student Association is being called
into question, and rightly so. While
the USSA is a powerful lobbying arm
for students, they espouse some decid-
edly left—of—center political views.

SGB decided some years ago to
align with the group, which means

' they pay $1,000 a year —— from our

student activities fee money — for a
school-wide membership. Every stu-
dent, then, is considered a member of
the group, whether or not they agree
with its ideologies, and regardless of
their awareness of it. ‘SGB doesn’t
obscure this fact,.but they don’t shout
it from the top of, the Cathedral, either.
It’s fair to say many, if not most, stu-
dents are unaware of USSA and their
membership in it.

Conservatives who are aware of
the group and its views are up in arms.
They say that student money should-
n’t be spent on a membership that so
few students know about and ——' they
say — would agree with. It’s a valid
point, and one that merits consider-
able debate and a calm exchange of
ideas. 

Our membership in the USSA is a
prickly issue. There is no denying
USSA is powerful and represents stu-
dent issues — like Pell Grant money
—-— in Washington D.C.,, where stu-

dents have little say otherwise. There
is also no denying the group’s left
leanings. A

What should be occurring is a
rational examination of the issue.
SGB should make it their business to
present their constituency —-— the stu-
dents — with the facts, and with real-
istic‘ options to satisfy the greatest
number of students.

What seems to.be shaping up,

'however, is name-calling and the

reduction of a complicated issue into
emotional, ideological sound bytes,
and it’s an insult to the intelligence of
the students who voted the board into
office.

Those in favor of our USSA mem-
bership can reduce it.to an issue of
students’ rights, saying that those

against it are against ﬁnancial aid and’

lobbyingfor student concerns.

Those against our membership
can reduce the USSA to a pro-choice,
pro—affirrnative action, radical group
that has no business speaking for stu-
dents.

We deserve more than V a play-
ground razz session.

SGB, your shortened term is near-
ly up. Leave a, legacy of ‘clarity and
respect to the students who elected
you. Explain this situation and present
viable alternatives, and do it maturely.

,You’ll be remembered as the first

board to do such an honorable thing.

Hatch ab democracy in the caital

In mid-August, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, introduced the D.C. Personal
Protection Act, a bill to repeal the 27-year-
old handgim ban iI1 Washington, D.C. The
people affected by his bill carmot vote on it,
because Washington, D.C. has no vote in
Congress. A

Washington, D.C.’s congressional rep-
resentatives are euphemized into “dele-
gates.” They are without the only true inﬂu-
ence — the vote. Almost every elected oili-
cial in Washington, D.C. has objected to
Hatch’s proposal. Congressional Delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton (D),
Mayor Anthony Williams (D),
and City Council, a mix of R’s
and D’s, have disapproved.
“The District is being targeted

helpless without senators and
the full panoply of legal rights
to protect ourselves,” Norton
said, according to a July 17
article in The Washington
Post.

And because of its non-voting status,
Washington, D.C.’s residents and represen-
tatives carmot effectively protest this unfair
treatment, especially in light of the factthat
Hatch’s action has precedents. For instance,

. Congress must approve the city’s budget,

and, a few years ago, it refused to allocate
locally raised tax money to count the ballots
of a local medical marijuana initiative. You
read that right. Congress forbade the votes
from even being counted. Had that hap-
pened in any other country, ‘there would
have been screams of disenfranchisement
and election fraud from the international
community. .

It comes as no surprise —— at least to
Washington, D.C. residents — that
Congress proposed a bill that would negate,
without their consent, a law they had passed.

Hatch’s bill reasons that Washington,
D.C.’s handgim ban violates the Second
Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

  

Sydney Bergman
Assistant Opinions Editor

 

Unfortimately for him, the Supreme Court’s
long-standing interpretation of that amend-
ment doesn’t agree. In 1939, the Court held,
in United States v. Miller. ‘The Court can-
not take judicial notice that a shotgun hav-
ing a barrel less than 18 inches long has
today any reasonable relation to the preser-
vation or elﬁciency of a well regulated mili-
tia and therefore cannot say that the Second
Amendment guarantees to the citizen the
right to keep and bear such a weapon.”
Handgtms are not Second
Amendment-protected guns. Size matters to
' . the Court, and this ruling
should matter to Hatch and
Congress.

Already, two lawsuits
challenging the city’s gun ban
are underway, one brought by
the National Riﬂe Association,
the other by Bob levy, of the
Cato Institute, a libertarian
think tank They disagree on
how to challenge the law, but
are addressing properly: before
a judge, where residents and non—residents
have equal footing.

Perhaps Hatch believes that, in order to
save a city, one must ignore its residents’
wishes. Perhaps he thinks that, once the ban

is lifted, Washingtonians will be so busy-

cha-cha—ing in their armed streets that they
can doublethink his means away. But being
deprived of basic. rights is not easily
shrugged off.

In attempting to protect Washington,
D.C.’s Second Amendment rights, Hatch
forgets the spirit that passed the Bill of
Rights —— to protect citizens from being
governed unfairly — and governing with-
out consent is the acme of unfaimess.
Hatch’s desired ends demean not only those
affected, but also our deepest Constitutional

' convictions.

You make a pit stop at the corner
bakery to grab a donut or a quick
scone while out '
for your morn-
ing walk. Your
faithful terrier
sits obediently
outside while
you purchase
your pastry. _
Afterward, you
both continue
your walk, you
feeling grati-
fied, your pet
nipping at any
stray crumbs that fall into his reach.
Now there’s no need to leave your
dog sitting outside — a store in
Shadyside offers the opportunity for
your four-legged companion to join
you. ' ,
WAG, a boutique and “barkery,”
or bakery for dogs, serves up treats
specially made for man’s best friend.

The store has a “guard dog” to make sure things operate smoothly, inside and out.

 

The store even offers a small area in
the back where dog owners can drink
coffee and sit while their pets enjoys
the treats, 75 percent of which are
homemade. And WAG even caters to
events including-your dog’s birthday
or any other special occasion.

Inside the store, the walls are
lined with items that would make
any canine’s mouth water and tail
wag. WAG sells pet beds, toys,‘
designer collars and even
items you wouldn’t find in
most conventional pet
stores, such as jewelry and
nail polish. For those dog
lovers who want to buy
something for themselves,
WAG offers board games,
pillows, magnets and other
items to show off how much
you cherish your pet.

If you are concerned
about your pet’s spiritual
well-being, along with its
diet, WAG is the first store in
Pittsburgh to offer Kosher Pet Foods,
the only patented dog and cat treats
that are certified to be kosher for
your pet’s Bar or Bat Mitzvah, which
WAG also caters.

The unique boutique is the idea
of Leigh Ann Leshock, a native
Pittsburgher and graduate of

Older and Bud—wiser

This summer, I had
the exciting experience
of interviewing Eve 6’s
lead singer, Max

Collins. He said
something in that
interview that has

been haunting me over
the last few weeks: “I
think when you hit 22,
23, 24 it’s definitely one
of those transitional
periods where you’re not

a teen-ager and youfre try-
ing as hard as hell not to
become an adult, you
know? In another way, you
are being forced into
responsibility.”

Up until tomorrow, I don’t fall
into the category Collins was speak-
ing of. Tomorrow is my '22nd birth-
day; I will be falling into that catego-
ry and I am starting to freak.

This time last year, I was elated at
the fact that my birthday had finally
rolled around. After having my fake
ID taken away in April, I pretty much
sat at home, in lovely Canonsburg —
it’s on the map, look an inch or two
below Pittsburgh — because all my
friends were out enjoying the bar
scene. I couldn’t even drag someone
to the movies with me, nor could I
attend a Pirates game because I was
the lone under-ager, the one that
wouldn’t be able to hit up Tequila
Willy’s after the game. Anyway, one
year ago, I had that nervous-excite-
ment feeling. Friends were traveling
from their respective colleges on a
Tuesday night to celebrate the day I
had anticipated for 21 years.

I would no longer bitch to my
mom about being the youngest in my
group of friends. About this mile-
stone, she kept saying, “Then what
will you have to look forward to?”

My response was always a quick,
“Reduced car insurance at 25.” h
I don’t even pay car insurance, and if
I did, I am not going to be as elated
about that on my 25th birthday as I
was about legally drinking on my
21st.

I am becoming a grown-up before
my very eyes. I am on the cusp of
graduation. This birthday marks the
last that will go hand in hand with a
back—to—school shopping trip. I
recently moved out of Oakland —
because four years there was enough

— and into a one-
bedroom apartment
on the South Side. I

am too old to deal with
roommates’ antics,
and my last two room-
mates showed me just
how disrespectful peo-
ple can be.

Independence flowed
through my veins as I
placed each piece of
furniture into my new
place. It flowed just as it
had when I flashed my
ID last August 27th,
because this year I don’t
need someone else to live
with me, and last year I didn’t need
someone else to buy my alcohol for
me-
Alas, ﬂashing that ID _isn’t all
that exciting anymore, but when I hit
25 it probably will be, because some-
one is acknowledging the. remnants
of my youth.

I know what you all are saying:
“It’s not like she’s turning 30.” No,
I’m not turning 30. I am just hitting
that point inlife where all things are
uncertain.

This time next year, I’ll be a
rookie writer at a publication, at best.
At worst, I’ll still be a waitress at
Improv. But I don’t know which it
will be, or what the in—between is.
Will I be in Pittsburgh still? Or will
luck shine down upon me and whisk
me away to New York City to join the
ranks of the Village Voice or, my ulti-
mate dream, Rolling Stone? Or will I
head west to Los Angeles where I’ll
team up with MTV’s Bunim/Murray
Productions? Probably not, but
maybe these are the things that will
make me look forward to b—day num-
ber 30.

Until then, I’ll bask in what
time remains where I don’t have to
worry about mortgages, health insur-
ance or cooking a holiday dinner to
impress my in-laws. Until then, I’ll
go out on weeknights, weekends and
days in between. I’ll go to the
upcoming Lynyrd Skynyrd show at
Star Lake, excuse me, the Post-
Gazette Pavilion, and I will revel in
the fact that I was too young to sport
a mullet when they were in style —— if
you can call that a style -— much less’
keep it with me for 20 years. A

Happy birthday to me!

Remarkably well-developed char-
acters make “Dirty Pretty Things”

seem too literary to be a thriller. The

depravity they encounter makes it
seem too dark to be a thriller.
Technically, though, it is one. Writer
Steve Knight’s hook: The film’s pro-
tagonists areoexploited illegal immi-
grants in London. They might as well
be in hell. ‘

Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a doc-
tor before he emigrated from Nigeria,

is a taxi driver by day and hotel desk"

clerk by night. He’s surviving, but at
a cost: He never sleeps. -He won’t let
his guard down; his existence in
London is too fragile. He shares an
apartment with paranoid Turkish
immigrant Senay (Audrey Tautou),
who is a maid at the hotel in secret —-—
her foreign national status forbids her
to work.

The ﬁlm’s plot takes shape when
Okwe finds a human heart clogging
the toilet in one of the hotel’s rooms.
His manager (Sergi Lopez), suspi-
ciously unsurprised by the find, tells
him to forget it — this sort of thing is
part of the hotel business. But. Okwe
can’t forget. And for fear of his illegal
status coming to light, he can’t deal
with the police either. He has to

uncover the hotel’s dirty little secret
on his own. ’

Ejiofor is a welcome new. face,
completely believable as a complex
leading man — Okwe comes across
as able and intelligent, but also
strung—out and desperate. Tautou does
some nice breaking down; if you fell
in love with her as the title character
of “Amelie,” prepare to be devastated
by her fate here. The quasi—romance
between Okwe and Senay adds an
extra layer of ‘"'s'adness"to their trip
through the wringer. And Lopez, as a
devil whose proposition poses the
film’s central moral question, is per-
fectly hateable.

Director Stephen Frears, who’s
been successful in multiple genres
over the past two decades (dramas
like “Dangerous Liaisons” and come-
dies like “High Fidelity”), is back to
the kind of well-drawn characters and
dark subject matter he portrayed in
one of his best films, l990’s “The

_ Grifters.” It’s just too bad he doesn’t

have as good an ending this time
around. The resolution of “Dirty
Pretty Things” lacks the edge present
in the rest of the film.

Still, it’s a solid, intellectual
thriller. And more than worthwhile. '

“Dirty Pretty Things” opens August
29 at The Oaks Theater, located at
310 Allegheny River Boulevard ‘in
Oakmont. Call (412) 828-6311 or

Long not interested in other conferences

Editor’s note: On July 17th, sports
editor Joe Marchilena sat down with
new Athletics Director Jeﬁ’ Long to
discuss the future of the program. The
following is a selection of excerpts
from the second half of the interview.

The Pitt News: All the focus has been
on adding football schools. What has
been discussed about basketball?

Jeff Long: We’re in a process, now,
of discussing our future; the future of
our basketball- and football—playing
schools together. The promise we
both have, as we go into this process
and discussions, is what can we do to
make both football and basketball —
and our Olympic sports —stronger?
In those discussions, we’ll examine a
number of different things.

We’ll look at a number of differ-
ent options to make each other

stron er, and one of those options 

is whether the conference will stay
together.

There’s also discussions about
how we can stay together as a 16-
team conference with eight football-
playing schools and eight basketball
schools and then, of course, our
Olympic sports. With those options
on the table, as we go forward, it’s
about what we can do to strengthen
this conference and strengthen the
institutions that compete in it. '

TPN: If a better offer were presented
from another conference, would there
be any consideration about leaving
the Big East? '

JL: Our focus is kind of just what I
said. Right now, our focus is making
our current grouping of football—play-
ing schools and basketball schools as
strong as we can be.

Other things are just speculation.

-.. ..,-.. V».-:..».,, --—-p.

We’re not talking with any other con-
ferences other than the group that
we’re associated with now.

TPN: So, then, if that were to come
up, it wouldn’t be an option?

JL: It’s difficult to say whether it
would be an option because we’re
talking in hypotheticals.

Certainly, as an institution, we
would listen to opportunities. We
would need to do that for our institu-
tion, but I would say, as far as what is
happening now, we’re focusing on
strictly the current group of schools.

TPN: With the experience you have
in dealing with student season-ticket
programs at Oklahoma, would you
consider changing the way, especially
' with basketball tickets, that it’s done
here?

 

JL: To be honest, I’m still getting
familiar with how we distribute our
tickets to our students. I think student
involvement is very important. When
students get tickets and buy tickets,
we want them to not only show up for
the big games, we want them to show
up for all games.

There’s a number of different
plans and ways of going about
enhancing the student experience, and
we’re going to examine that as part of

our normal process coming in. When .

we do that, we will get feedback and
take feedback from students.
Feedback from students is impor-
tant, [as are] understanding what their
thoughts are and then bringing that
together with the goals of the athletic
program and finding the best way to
bring those two groups together so we
can both accomplish what we want.

‘THE PITT NEWS

Long, page 9

TPN: One way to avoid having students show up
for only the big games would be to have a stronger
non—conference schedule. While he was interim
athletics director, Marc Boehm had said that the
basketball program wasn’t at the point where it

' could make a stronger non-conference schedule.
’ After last season’s Big East and NCAA Tournament

run, is it at that point now?

JL: 1 would say, yes, I think our success has shown
that our programs have advanced to the point where
competition is important, and we can begin to build
on our non—conference,schedu1e. Q

But what I think about our students is [they]
need to feel good about our program, and [I want]
our students to come and support [their] fellow stu-
dents, regardless of who we’re playing. If you look
at the top schools around the country, students
aren’t just ‘deciding to come to just the big games.

We want that kind of support from our students
and we’ll be reaching out and trying to work with
our students to get that. Students coming, enjoying
the game and getting into the game is; part of my
marketing efforts to get other people to come and
buy full—price tickets to those games, because stu-
dents are -part of that atmosphere that we want to
create. ’ '

TPN: What would you say to a recruit who is
unsure about coming to Pitt? A

JL: The first thing that I always pointto is an out-

\

standing academic institution. You can’t trade that. _
Then I’d tell them to lookwhere we’ve come from
and look where we’re going. This is a program on
the rise.

There are several different ways to look at an
institution, but this is a program that’s on the rise.
They’ve got the opportunity to step intoa very
exciting situation. We are just beginning to engage
the people of Pittsburgh in this area and get them
re-energized and excited about the University of
Pittsburgh.

I think it’s clear that we have the facilities, par-
ticularly in football and men’s and women’s basket-
ball, that shows that we’re committed to our athlet-
ic program. I think that, if you look around our pro-
gram, not only do we now have physical facilities,
we’ve got great coaching staffs, we’ve got a great
support staff and we’ve got a great academic staff
here. Put all those things together, and it’s a great
opportunity for any student to have. -

TPN: Is it difficult coming into a job where there
are already coaches established and being able to
communicate with them on the same page?

JL: We’re just in the beginning of getting to know-
each other. With thetiming of my hiring, and then
some of the things that have gone on with our con-
ference situation, andthen with it being the sum-
mer, when coaches are involved in camps — they
[were] out on the road for the whole month of July
—— we haven’t had the chance to really get to know
each other. .
They need to get to know me, know what my
values "are, what my expectations are and I need to

Improvements to Pitt’s campus impress I new athletics director.

get to know them, the way they run their program
and the way they present themselves. I’m really
looking forward to getting to know them and work-
ing with them as we build programs for our student
athletes. «

TPN: Have you had a chance to do anything in the
city? .

JL: I have two daughters, and my wife and I took
them to a play down at the Benedum [Center]. I
entertained about 15 sponsors down at the Pirates’
baseball game, so I got to enjoy PNC Park and got

to see that beautiful facility. I’ve gone up on Mount‘

Washington and I’ve [seen] that view back down to
the city and the point. I haven’t had a chance to get
to really know the city, but let me tell you this —
I’ve been nothing but impressed with the beauty of
the city of Pittsburgh.

I was really taken aback when I came for my
visit in the interview process because I hadn’t been
in Pittsburgh in 20 years or more. I was just really
excitedwhen I saw how the city had changed and
improved itself and the work they’ve done along
the riverfronts and how the University of Pittsburgh
had grown and_ the work they’ve done to beautify
the campus and really continue to work to create a
real campus environment in Oakland.

The people have been tremendous here. I’ve
been very well received and accepted by everyone
I’ve met, and everybody told me that that’s the way
I would find Pittsburghers, and I’ve not been disap-
pointed. They’ve been very helpful and very

accepting of my family and I, and I’m really look— 1

ing forward to getting to know it even better.
