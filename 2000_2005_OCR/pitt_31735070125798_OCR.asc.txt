Raising the bar since 1906

VOLUME IVC NUMBER 34

Some off-campus housing not A
ﬁnished at move-in tie

JAMES DEWEESE
Staff Writer

Almost a month into the academic year and more than nine
months since the start of tlrerenovation of three South Oakland
apartment buildings managed by E.S. Management, many resi-
dents still aren’t ready to call them home sweet home.

Pitt senior Erika Lauris moved in Aug. 15.

“We’ve lived here for a month, and we still don’t have phone

jacks,” she said. ‘.‘The ﬁrst couple of days I don’t think we even 0

had a toilet.”

Tim Clark, a senior, had similar problems. According to
Clark, when he ﬁnally moved into his apartment — 15 days after
the lease was originally scheduled to begin — the fumace didn’t
work, and there was no hot water, no phone jacks and no working
ﬁre alarms. ‘ — ,

Robert Larson of E.S. Management said that delays are some-
times a hazard of renovation projects.

“We’ve been doing this for 15 years [and] we’ve done dozens

of projects,” he said. “[But] it doesn’t always go like clockwork.”

Clark said he and his roommate planned to move into a two-

bedroom unit in one of the three yellow-brick apartment buildings '

located between 3609 and 3617 Dawson St: on Aug. 1.

But during the summer, Clark received a letter from E.S.
Management telling him that his apartment would not be ready on
time.

Clark said each time he called or stopped by the building to

, verify the progress of the renovations, representatives of the real
- estate management corporation pushed back the completion date.
While waiting for the work tofrnish, Clark said he accumu- ~

latedv $40 in storage fees for his belongings and divided his time
between a North Side day camp where he worked and friends’
houses in Oakland. »

When he signed the lease, agreeing to pay $795 per month for
the two—bedroom apartment, Clark said he knew the buildings
were undergoing extensive renovations, but according to him rep-

resentatives of E.S. Management had promised that the work »-

would be complete before his expected rnove-in date.
The renovations, which began last November, are near com-
pletion, according to construction supervisor Dean Bramer.
’ Bramer said his‘ team of 30 to 50 workers will likely complete
the renovations on the 30 units of rental housing by next week
He said when he completes the work “these buildings are
gomia be supplying Pitt students for the next 30 years.”
Larson said he believes the residents’ primary complaint has
been the additional time involved in the renovations, but he added

‘ future tenants were aware of the possibility of delays when they

signed their leases. T .
To underscore his point, Larson indicated language in the

I leases that stipulated that the rental was to begin on the date of the

lease, “or as soon afterward as the apartment or house is ready for
occupancy.” '

In the meantime, /Clark has ﬁled a complaint with the-

Allegheny County Health Department Housing and Community
Enviromnent Project. He said he had no working ﬁre alarm and
he “knew things like the ﬁre alarm were violations.”

. YANT/PHOTO EDITOR
Construction delayed some students’ plans to move into

 

‘these apartments on Dawson Street.

Robert Hopkins of I the Housing Resource Center said his
ofﬁce has also received complaints. The center, located at 127 N.
Belleﬁeld Ave., provides area information and rental assistance to
Pitt students. -

Although the center does not allow direct access to the formal

A complaints it maintains on ﬁle, Hopkins said the center does pro-

vide oral summaries of the reports’ contents.

According to Hopkins, the center has received four formal
complaints this year in which tenants in E.S. Management buﬂd-
ings allege health and safety Violations including lack of water and
missing smoke detectors. 0 '

Hopkins said some former tenants registered complaints

before the renovations began as well. According to Hopkins, ten- _

ants sought counsel after E.S. Management issued them 60 days
notice to vacate the building so they could begin the renovations
in earnest. . I

Hopkins added it was particularly difﬁcult for some of the
displaced -students to ﬁnd housing for the remaining two months
of the school year. - .

While the property managers were within their legal right to
remove the tenants, he said that other developers in Oakland, in
similar situations, had waited for the full lease t_erm to expire
before beginning renovations. .

Larson‘ said that many of the buildings’ former tenants
remained as late as March, indicating that E.S. Management could
not implement thefull scope of their renovations until the build-
ings remained completely unoccupied. .

Middle East
instability
diverts
Semester at Sea

AMANDA SHEAFFER
The Pitt News

The Institute for Shipboard Education
decided on Sept. 21 to divert the current
voyage of Semester at Sea from its sched-
uled itinerary because of the increased
instability in the Middle East.

‘ The new itinerary will take effect
after the ship’s departure from Hong
Kong in the next few days. The plarmed
itinerary would take the students from
Hong Kong to Vietnam, Malaysia, India,
Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, Italy and
Morocco. But according to Paul Watson,
director of enrollment for the program, in
light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
ship will leave from Hong Kong and trav-
el directly to Kenya, South Africa, Brazil
and Cuba in_order to ensure the safety of
the passengers.

“This is a challenge for the curricu-
lum, but we are always prepared to
change the itinerary,” Watson said.

The S.S. Universe Explorer is playing 0

host this semester to 650 college students
and 200 teachers and adult passengers.
The passengers have been informed of the
revised itinerary and are already making
alterations to insure thecontinuum of edu-
cation.

“We are bringing other professors on
board and using in-port lectures to com-
pensate for the missed countries,” Watson
said. '

This is the second fall voyage in two
years that has been diverted because of

"tension in the Middle East. The Fall 2000
voyage was rerouted from India after the '

Oct. 12, 2000, bombing of the USS Cole
as it refueled off the coast of Yemen.
Instead of heading to Egypt, it went to
Kenya and followed a similar plan to this
year’s voyage.

“There have been a lot of calls from
parents and friends with general questions
concerning the safety of the ship,” Watson
said. The ship also remains in communi-
cation with a variety of public and private
sources of information concerning the
security of the scheduled ports.

“Safety is our No. 1 concern,”
Watson said. The ship is scheduled to
return to the United States on Dec. 9.

Students find internships
in untraditional places 1

JAMES DEWEESE
Staff Writer

Pitt seniors Andrea Girvan and Valerie -

Stallworth spent a day last semester work-
ing with a decapitated human body in Pine
Township, Pa. _

As Stallworth and the assistant deputy

coroner of Allegheny County worked to -
, remove the partially decayed remains of an

apparent suicide victim from the wooded
area, the corpse’s head came loose and
began to roll slowly away from them.

This semester, more than 100 Pitt stu-
dents are participating in internships
through the College of Arts and Sciences
internships program. That number does not
include those who anange credit-bearing
internships through their own academic
departments. « .

According to Beth Ruff, CAS intem-
ship coordinator, only one-quarter of the

. internships in which students are currently

participating are what she considers to be
traditional “business—type intemships.”

A quick review of materials available
in the internship department oﬂice, located

' in the College Connections Center in Thaw

Hall, reveals that this semester’s internship
choices range from a ﬁlm internship at The
Video House in Greentree, Pa, to bot-
tlenose dolphin and humpback whale
research at the University of Hawaii in
Manoa,  ‘-
“What -we have listed [on the
University Web site] is literally a drop in the
ocean,” ’ said Connie Angermeier, ‘former
director of CAS internships at Pitt.
Stallworth described another scene——
the ﬁrst day on the job, both she and Girvan
went to the mobile home of an elderly man
who, according to Stallworth, died alone.
She said that when they arrived, they found
the man’s home in such disrepair and so
cluttered with trash that she couldn’t believe

anyone, especially friends and family, could —

allow it to happen.

Neither of these events painted a pretty
picture, both the interns said, but they
formed part of the panorama of life events
that these two Pitt students participated in
over the last summer as interns with the
Allegheny County coroner.

“We picked up dead people,” said
Girvan, summarizing her experience suc-

cinctly. But she said the experience was
much more than that . ‘

Saturdays and Sundays ﬁom the begin-
ning of June to the second week of August,
Girvan and Stallworth participated in crime
scene analysis, coroners’ inquests, court-
room proceedings and forensics lab work.

“No matter what you hear from other
people about the [coroner’s] internship,
nothing prepares you for what you’re actu-
ally going to see. Expect anything,” Girvan
said. -

rFor Girvan — who was looking into
graduate schools for crime scene forensics
when she began the internship —— some of
the graphic images she has taken with her
have helped her redeﬁne her career goals.
She said that she now has a deeper respect
for the profession and the people who, dedi-
Cate themselves to it, but that she will prob-

ably look into forensic psychology “to deal .

with live people.”

Stallworth, on the other hand, found
her experience to be life— and career-choice-
aﬁirming.

“It gave you the opportunity to look at
death in a different manner,” ﬂreAfricana
studies major and pre-med student said.

Far from deterring her, Stallworth said
her experiences and proximity to death have
made her want to investigate some aspects
of physical forensics even further.

Ruff said real world experience makes
worldng with the Allegheny County coro-
ner one of the most popular internships. But
she said it is just one of many others that

enable students to get the more speciﬁc .

skills they need to make themselves stand
out.

Students generally research and secure -

their own internship opportunities. Ruff
said the Web site is a good place to start, but
that ultimately students may take an intern-
ship anywhere they want," provided they
meet certain criteria. ‘

She pointed out that the most important
criterion for the approval of an internship is
simply that the students learn something.

The internship must provide hands-on

experience in a professional ﬁeld. An

internship that consists solely of clerical ,

work would not be acceptable, Ruff said.
Once the students have identiﬁed an’
appropriate location for an internship, they

may seek sponsorship from a University ’

professor or attend one of the three-part

seminars that CAS offers in order to receive

credit. ' .
Angermeier, who helped develop th

seminars and continues to teach lhern, said V

the seminars give students an opportlmity to

address a variety of internship—related issues ‘

such as soliciting feedback from supervi:

sors, dealing with ‘workplace conﬂict, ’
requesting greater responsibility and apply- ‘

ing the skills the students gain to their career
choices. ‘ -

The biggest problem, Angermeier said,-
is "not ﬁnding the right internship or spon-

sorship for a student, it’s “ etting the word-

out.” She encourages all students who are
eligible to do an internship. “It’s never too
early, but it’s also never too late,” she said,
The University provides information
about academic internships through the
CAS internship Web site at
www.pitt.edu/~intern/intsearch.htm and

through the Placement and Career Services ’

Web site at www.placement.pitt.edu.

Search for careers, nice climates, takes
many grads out of Pittsburgh region

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

Miranda Hyatt, 19, wants to
wear shorts and a tank top to work.

Actually, Hyatt, a sophomore
who wants to work in “some sort of
big business,” just wants to live in a
place with a more hospitable cli-
mate.

Pittsburgh’s rainy, snowy and
soggy weather is a major factor in
driving about 50 percent of all Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon University and
Duquesne University graduates to
find jobs outside the Pittsburgh met-
ropolitan area.

In spite of these complaints, a
recent study performed by the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs and the Career
and Location Decisions Project
shows that Pittsburgh’s retention of
young professionals rose over the
past seven years. A

This study surveyed 2,000 pro
fessionals who graduated from Pitt,
CMU and Duquesne between 1994
and 1999. It reported that one in two
of these graduates chose to stay in

Pittsburgh to pursue a career, espe-
cially those in science and technolo-
gy. Of those who do leave, most
choose to stay within the megalopo—
lis — the Atlanta to Boston chain of
cities along the East Coast.

Pitt political science professor
Susan Hansen conducted the study.

“Our biggest competition comes
from the surrounding states of New
York, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and
New Jersey,” Hansen said.

Funded by the Heinz Foundation
and the R.K. Mellon Foundation,
Hansen said she hopes the GSPIA
project stimulates dialogue locally.

Stephen M. Rakes, the technical
and sciences career counselor at
Pitt’s office of Placement and
Career Services, echoed these find-
ings.

He said that half the people want
to stay initially, and that “it’s
always been a trend  [people]
want to see what else is out there.”

The study found that though
some alums journeyed to the Pacific
Sun Belt, Seattle and Silicon Valley,

looking to return to Pittsburgh.

Others, particularly those with
graduate professional degrees, opted
not to ‘leave in the first place.

In fact, the number of science and’

technical people who chose to stay
jumped 25 percent between 1994
and 1999. ‘

Efforts made by organizations
such as the Pittsburgh Digital
Greenhouse and the Pittsburgh
Technology Council have con-
tributed to the recent rise in gradu-
ate retention.

For instance, the technology

council addresses the issue of pro-1

fessionals leaving by creating “pro—
grams  designed to retain a high
percentage [of students] that gradu-
ate from area universities every year
with degrees in electrical engineer-
ing, computerengineering and com-
puter science.”

Participants cited ‘other reasons
for staying in Pittsburgh. These
include affordable housing, cheap
and convenient transportation,
access to universities for continued
education and economic opportuni-

ties.

Renovations
prove extensive

Apartments, page 1

Larson also said he believed the out-
come of the renovations, which involved
what he referred to as “stripping the build-
ing down to the walls.”

“When somebody goes in and puts a
coat of paint, that’s not a renovation,” he
said. “When we’re done, you’ll be hard
pressed to find an apartment that nice any-
where in Oaklan .”

9 Hopkins agreed that the scope of work
was large and said he believes that the stu-
dents will ultimately be pleased with the
outcome.

“We want the quality improved,”
Hopkins said. “They’re trying to improve
the housing stock. That’s great.”

While Hopkins praised E.S.
Management’s initiative in rebuilding
Oakland, he stressed that often’ the differ-
ence between what people see as good
landlords and as bad landlords revolves
around how they respond to complaints.

“It is entirely possible that if E.S. had
been more forthcoming, much of this
could have been avoided,” he said.

Echoing this sentiment, Pitt student
Matt Davis said, “They really just weren’t
sensitive to the fact that we’re students.”

Promises made, promises kept

Student Government Board’s response
to Sept. 1l’s attacks demonstrated its com-
petence — even before members’ official
inauguration Tuesday. It responded quickly
by organizing student response forums and
a vigil corresponding exactly to the one-
week anniversary of the attacks.

Now that the new SGB is ofﬁcially
sanctioned, members should continue their
laudable efforts by remembering the cam-
paign promises that got them elected.
While it’s still early in the year, it appears
that SGB is off to a good start.

SGB President Jeff Alex made few
explicit promises during the campaign. He
said he would institute a plan of action sim-
ilar to the last board’s seven-point plan, but
one has not been publicly armounced.
Similarly, Alex promised to send a letter
containing SGB contact information to all
student organizations during September.
The Pitt News, which happens to be a carn-
pus student organization, has received no
such letter.

Several board members campaigned
on making financial aid understandable
and accessible to students, and the board is
making good on those promises. Michelle
Agostini, in conjunction with other board
members, is working on an upcoming
financial aid awareness week. Additionally,
Agostini is working with Kerianne Ludwig
and Kevin Washo Jr. to organize a
statewide conference to discuss tuition

hikes and ﬁnancial aid.

Board member Heidi Busche is fulﬁll-
ing campaign promises to take action
against woeful housing conditions and
negligent landlords in Oakland by assem-
bling housing and landlord information to
be distributed to students. She has already
begun her effort by writing letters to sever-
al realtors and landlords. Ludwig is also
working with the urban studies department
to obtain information regarding tenants’
rights. ‘

, an Call and transportation services
also topped the list of campaign promises
last spring. Lonny Fish, Carrie Howard and
John Algie are working in concert with the
transportation , department to improve’ and
expand services, particularly Van Call.

Other promises in the works include
Meghan Fetzer’s effort to institute online
registration, Fish’s effort to get free gradu-
ate school exam test preparation and
Washo’s scholarship and grant guide.

In short, SGB has been successful in
its beginnings. Nonetheless, this board
must also remember that one of the major
problems plaguing student government is a

failure to finish the jobs that it starts._

Students. deserve regular updates on the
progression of projects. This includes
Fetzer’s plans for building a gym in South
Oakland and Algie’s plans to improve off-
campus food — promises we haven’t
heard anything about since the election.

But there’s something

reason women are viewed,
even by each other, as back-
stabbing and ruthless, a sirn-
ple and disturbing reason. It’s

H, can’t dismiss them right off
the bat. '
How many male leaders

with whom they share their
knowledge and connections?
Why is it that women can’t do
the same? When a new young
man appears on the scene,

have a habit of blaming each
other for their disadvantages, rather than
the real culprit: the people in power. For
Africa, that’s traditional western society.
And for women, it’s traditional western
society. I . ' -

That’s a blanket statement if there ever
was one, so let me explain. Women in our
culture are ﬁghting for a lirnited number of
resources allotted to us. Whoever ends up
with the lastsrnall piece of the pie left for
us is envied  despised.

You’ll see it in class, where the girl
who speald out the most is scorned by
most of her female classmates, and doesn’t

seem to mind. Or you’ll see it in the cam-

pus organizations you join, where the one’
woman in a position of leadership is sur-

V rounded by men and not too ﬁiendly to

new women recruits.

The reason these women are hated is
because they seem to have what all women
want — equality with men, a right that
many people seem to think we already

have. But just wait until another woman"

makes a bid for power within a group, or
makes her presence known. You’ll see
how short the equality supply really runs
on the female side of things.

It could almost be a National
Geographic program: “Watch as the dom-
inant female ﬁghts to protect her turf from
the young challenger. She will stop at
nothing to thwart the other’s progress, in

order to protect her much-desired crown.” '

Or how about a real life example,
from a time when most of us could barely
say “power structure?” When I was 3 years
old, I began to go to a babysitter in the
aftemoons when nursery school was over.

This woman also watched another little

girl and two slightly older boys.

These “playmates” were less playful
than you might think. One day the boys
dragged the other girl and I out to the dri-
veway, stood us on opposite sides, and told
us “You’re going to ﬁght each other now,
and whoever wins is our favorite girl.”

Today I would laugh at that kind of

‘ social Darwinism, and all that “survival of

eager to take on responsibility

‘and work creatively, he is commended. He

practically ﬂoats to a position of power
down a red carpet. When a woman does
the same, she is suspected and immediate-
ly dubbed “ruthless” (which is a compli-

ment _for men, but not for women)..

Professional women can’t fear each other
if we want to succeed.

_ On a more basic level, on a level hav-
ing nothing to do with our professional
futures, we as woman need to restore our
trust in each other. It’s not our fault that we
are forced to compete with one another for

attention and approval ﬁom teachers,

employers, lovers and friends.

But it will be our fault if we recognize
this and do nothing to change it. By,the
simplest act, the act of ﬁiendship, we can
subvert a system that rewards us when we
distrust and betray each other.

Within the friendships we already ‘

have, we can look out for misplaced envy

and bitterness. If your ﬁiend is doing well I

for herself, commend her. Support her. Be
encouraged by her and go out and do the
same for yourself, in whatever aspect may
be important to you. Chances are V she’ll
have the same support for you.

There’s also the possibility of 4 new '

ﬁiendships. If you’re a woman with little
or no female friends, make an effort to ﬁnd
some. As every woman who has a network
of girlfriends can tell you, women’s ﬁiend-
ships are invaluable when you need
encouragement ora little help.

8 So damn the Man. Fight back in a way /

that doesn’t hurt anybody and helps all of

us. Check out the women around you and -

appreciate them.

And the next time you want to squash '
that little upstart coming up behind you, try
something revolutionary —- lend her a hand.

International Black Film and
Video Festival hitsthe city

Tonight through Sunday

For films, screening times and locations;
(412) 622-1466 ’
www.nbpc.tv

ERIC LIDJI p
Senior Staff Writer

With the consistent emergence of talented
black ﬁlmmakers, it is a shame that their ﬁlms are
still so hard to ﬁnd. The National Black
Programming Consortium holds their fourth
Annual Prized Pieces, International Black Film and

‘ Vl(lCO Festival this weekend. They will screen more

than 20 ﬁlms at different locations all over
Pittsburgh. -

‘And though all the films deal with themes relat-
ing to the black -experience, it is important to
remember that anyone can watch these ﬁlms and
anyone can enjoy them. Two of the festival’s fea-
tured ﬁlms include “A Huey P. Newton Story,” and
“Our Song.” I

At times frantic, at times sweet and sad, a 90-
minute monologue comprises “A Huey P. Newton
Story.” Through the constant blanket of Kool brand
cigarette smoke, the slow rise and fall of ash, sits a
play stripped of excess. Playing Huey P. Newton,

‘ Roger Guenveur Smith sits alone on a small stage

with a microphone and a chair; The full 360 degrees
surrounding him is filled by audience members
behind lattice fencing, merely silhou-
ettes themselves.
And Smith talks.

The “Story” of the title is abstract. 

There is no plot, it is just talk, pure
therapeutic talk. It is less a story than an explana-
tion. ‘

As Smith progresses, sweat drips down his
face, his legs jump and he makes slight kissing
noises as he lights up another cigarette. He plays off
of the audience and seems to take the monologue in

"whatever direction they lead. Because it was origi-

nally a play, which Smith adapted for taping, it
would be interesting to see it live, to see how much
really is improvised and how much is just brilliant
recital.

Before watching it, it is hard to imagine a direc-
tor even being an issue, the ﬁlm being, after all, “A
Huey P. Newton Story.” Smith is Newton, what
else? But of course that all depends on the director.
Spike Lee uses timely and restrained visuals placed
on the black background outside the stage to
emphasize Srnith’s talks, to speed it along to invig-
orate it even more than Srnith’s jittery dance inter-
lude to Bob Dylan’s ‘_‘Ballad of a Thin Man.” I

Written and directed by Jim McKay, “Our
Song” is the tale of three girls during one summer
in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

Purposefully low on plot, the ﬁlm
revolves around three events. The
ﬁrst is the closing of the girls’ school,
‘ forcing them all to ﬁnd new schools.
The second is the marching band that each partici-
pates in, andthat serves to segmentand rejuvenate
the viewing experience. The third is one of the cen-
tral characters’ pregnancy.

But this is the anti-‘.‘Stand By Me.” Shot and
presented in a naturalistic style that looks like a
documentary, various conversations are so real that
you often wonder if there is meaning and you are
always forced to ﬁnd it. Unlike modern narrative
convention, the pregnancy event does raise issues
such as “my life is ruined,” or “what am I going to
do?” Rather, the acting and camera work are so true
to life “Our Song” could easily be a Dateline or a
PBS documentary.‘ '

“A Huey 1’. Newton Story” and “Our Song” will
appear at the Kelly Strayhom Community
Performing Arts Center (the former Regent
Theatre). “Newton” will screen tonight at 7:30.

“Our Song” will screen Sunday at 3 p.m.

With dra wal of
the worst kind

I’m suffering withdrawal from a
drug more potent than I ever could

I miss the escape, the blank stare I
used to slip into, the simple mindless-

slip by so quickly, and I could com-
pletely forget everything else.

This semester, I don’t have a tele-
vision.

I’Ve always taken a sort of intellec-
tual pride in thinking that I could sur-
vive without one. I’ve always assured

myself that I could get by merely with
my books and my own brain; that human contact was better dur-
ing dirmer than that blue box, and that I was above its drivel.

Turns out there’s something comforting about that glowing
screen. .

When I sit down to eat dinner alone sometimes, I quickly
discover that I need some diversion; I feel strange eating alone.
Books are unwieldy while trying to eat a chicken leg; newspa-
pers require an art of craning the neck to read faraway text while
hovering over a bowl of soup.

The morning of Sept. 11, I was jolted out of bed by the
sound of my phone ringing. One of my friends called to tell me
about the World Trade Center. “Get to a T.V.,” he said. I took a
shower and ate breakfast before I left to ﬁnd a television. I guess
now that I know what happened that morning, in retrospect, it

. would have been kind of nice to have had a television.

The other night, I went out to dinner with a group of friends,
and we went to a restaurant that had televisions mounted above
the bar. I was embarrassed to ﬁnd myself zoning out from con-
versation to read Miss America’s closed captioning on David
Letterman’s show; Despite the fact that I’ve lasted more than a
month without watching television on my own, I’m still acutely
drawn toward the light. '

Part of the reason I don’t have a television is because I
assumed that at least one of my roommates would bring one,
and nobody did. Now, it feels as though we’re in a deadlock
over who will break down and buy one ﬁrst. For myself, it’s not
even really an issue of buying a television, but rather, admitting
to myself that I really miss it.

Granted, there are some things I’m willing to admit I miss
about it. I miss watching “The Simpsons,” and I wouldn’t mind
catching an episode of “Friends” or a “Seinfeld” rerun. And I’m
actually quite fond of Comedy Central.

I also miss watching videos at my own leisure. I can’t just
rent something I want to watch anymore — I have to make sure
it’s something whomever else I’m watching a movie with will
want to see. There are some ﬁlms from last year I still haven’t
seen because I don’t have anyone to watch them with.

I’ve even started to rationalize the purchase of a small tele-
vision. I’ve imagined just the kind of model I will buy, and the
ﬁrst video I’ll rent to break it in. But the voice of reason often
interrupts this line of thought for more a more important mes-
sage: I honestly don’t need a television. ‘ ‘

So will I last the semester or will I fold? Stay tuned to ﬁnd
out.

Andrew and Peter Cash had both been
making music independently for years before
they decided to combine their talents for the
Cash Brothers. Apparently, united they stand
— only now are they ﬁnally receiving radio
airplay and media attention, and with good
reason.

How Was Tomorrow, their first official
release, is filled with great melodies and har-
monies, kicking country-tinged guitar and
altogether heartfelt pop music.

One brother has a high voice and the
other has a lower voice. The two blend their
vocals together so naturally and perfectly that
it is difficult to believe they had never col-
laborated before.

The Cash Brothers are at their best during
faster, more upbeat songs. “Night Shift
Guru” particularly stands out. This song tells
the tale of a musician working the night shift
at a 7-Eleven, all the while imagining his face
on the tiny security televisions and on the
cover of the magazines. Besides having inter-
esting lyrics, the song is catchy and exciting;
it’s one of those songs that makes people
drive a little faster when it comes on the
radio.

more toward rock ‘n’ roll and pop. The broth-

Because Thurston Moore -
of legendary experimental rock
group Sonic Youth — postponed
his show at the Andy Warhol
Museum this weekend, many of
the local indie kids ﬁnd them-
selves with an empty hole to ﬁll
Friday night.

With their $10 refunds in
hand, they wonder what they’ll
do on a chilly autumn evening in
the greater Pittsburgh area.
Across town, something else
brews at the Warhol museum:
Good Fridays, a program that lets

E ’ people into the museum for free

from 5 to 10 p.m.

Students start sniffmg the air,
omens appear in the skies, pets
run rampant. Suddenly, a calm
settles over theicity as the word
spreads: the Microphones, ir1itial—
ly scheduled to open for Moore,
will play Good Fridays this week

Friday, September 28, 2001

despite the cancellation.

While the Microphones’
appearance may not equal the
gravity of Moore’s, those famil-
iar with lo—ﬁ independent rock
carmot deny the band’s appeal.

Phil Elvrum, the man behind
the Microphones, combines
eccentric lyrics — often about
recording equipment —with odd
song structures and a slew of
instrumentation, then balls them
up and unfolds them into several
amazing low-ﬁdelity records.

The songs range ﬁom rela-
tively straightforward, guitar—dri—
ven pop productions to the
atmospheric keyboard and synth-
based pieces on the Don’t Wake
Me Up album.

Elvrum, although collaborat-
ing with many artists on the
Microphones records, remains
the tour de force that one can
expect to blow the audience
away on Friday.

There’s a Microphones song
for everyone’s tastes. Even those
unfamiliar with the band can
expect —- at the very least —— a
good show; a good, free show.

Ozomatli is an Afro-Latin—style band
started in Los Angeles. The band blends
hip-hop verses with a large band consist-
ing of two horns, a bass, two drum kits, a
guitar and sometimes adisk jockey.

Embrace the Chaos features such
artists as Common, Wﬂl.I.arn from Black
Eyed Peas, as well as two members of De
La Soul. -

Steve Berlin of Los Lobos produced

three of the album’s songs. He insisted that ..

the horns playtogether rather than play
separately and mix'it1ater.This shows that
the horn players have talent, because if
one player made a mistake it would be

easily recognizable.

The album’s strengths are its fim, up-
tempo, dance—friendly salsa music, the tal-
ent of the musicians and the chemistry of
a band this size. _

The music gets more serious when
rap comes into the. songs. The band has a
tough time blending the salsa with hip-hop
in songs such as “Vocal Artillery.”

Ozomatli played  the world

-visiting Japan, Cuba, Australia, Europe

and Mexico. Also, they played with large
Latino acts such as Santana and Los
Lobos. '

The band made some changes since it
debuted three years ago. They lost their
original alto sax player and have a new
drummer, Andrew Mendoza. They have
also replaced Cut Cherriist, who spins the
turntable, with DJ Spinobi. MC Kanetic
Source is also new to the group.

After playing together for three years,
the original members of the group have
grown as musicians, but it will be interest-
ing to see how the group’s new members
will affect the onstage chemistry.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

 

In Rod

Kenneth Paul

It’s time for a change.

As I watched David Priesﬂey complete
10 passes for a whopping 64 yards and
heard the chants of R-O-D, I realized ﬁnally
that Priestley is not the man to lead this ball
club.

Even though he had an impressive
game against Virginia Tech way back in
1999 I cannot accept thetrainofthoughtthat
says that he has shown glimpses of bril-
liance because the fact ofthe matter is, that
he has done nothing during his tenure here.

Priestley hasn’t won a big game, he has-
n’t been consistent and as impressive as he
was against that mighty foe East Tennessee
State and as impressive as he was in the loss
to South Florida, I’m no longer willing to
believe that he is Pitt’s legitimate starter.

The team is now 1-2; it goes to Notre
Dame next week, and then plays Syracuse,
Boston College and Virginia Tech in three of
its next four games.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to
see Rod Rutherford grow — from his ﬁrst
game against Bowling Green last season to
theplayeristoday—-willtellyouthathehas
improved dramatically and that it is obvious
thatheworkedhardtoleamtheoﬁenseand
become an effective passer, not just an ath-
lete.

At this point, with many questions sur-
rounding the team, how can David Priestley
help this team? What’s the opportunity cost
of not giving Rutherford more reps?

Priestley will be gone after this year.
This isn’t high school, when you let the
seniors take their lumps because it’s their last
chance ever to play football. There is some-
thing at stake with every game, ranging
from television opportunities to recruiting,
not to mention fan support.

There is absolutely no doubt that this

Could it have been the 19 days oﬁ‘?
Could it have been the demoralizing loss to
South Florida, or could it have been that they
were considered underdogs by more than
three touchdowns?

All of these are viable reasons for Pitt’s
convincing 43-21 loss to the nation’s top-
ranked Miami Hurricanes Thursday night at
Heinz Field But head coach Walt Harris the-
orized that what was most detrimental to his
team was the blowout itself.

"Iheir running backs were hard to tack-
le,” Harris said 1 _

Rarely did the Pitt defense take down
Hurricane junior running back Clinton Portis
on the ﬁrst try; he made them pay dearly for
the sloppy tackling. At game’s end, he had
three rushing touchdowns and racked up 131
rushing yards on 24 attempts, averaging 5.5
yards per carry.

It was not Ken Dorsey alone —+ a Heisman trophy
candidate —— who defeated the Pittsburgh Panthers last
night. Rather, a bigger stronger and tougher offensive
line defeated the team. ‘

A bigger, stronger, and tougher offensive line
defeated the team.

Of course, the man running behind them, Clinton
Portis, also factored into Pitt’s losing equation.

Portis, a true junior from the University of Miami,
won the starting running back job back in August at
camp, and proved last night he deserved to win it.
Portis finished the game with 24 carries for 136 yards
and three big rushing touchdowns. He also caught two

Miami too tough

Freshman Willis McGahee also had a
big game, with 74 rushing yards on 10 car-
ries with a touchdown.

“We were tremendously inconsistent,”
said Harris while speaking of the quarter-
back position. “I coach those guys, and I’m
responsible for them”

Starter David Priestley seemed uncom-
fortable from the outset. He made 10 of 18
completions for just 64 yards. His throws
were off and twice nearly tipped into the
opposition’s hands. He fumbled twice, turn-
ing the ball over once. ‘

Rod Rutherford completed 7 of 17 pass-
es with one interception for 111 yards,
rushed for two touchdowns, and threw for
the ﬁrst touchdown of his collegiate career.
But he achieved most of these stats after the
 had ﬁrm control of the game.

' “We’ve got a lot of work to do,” said
Harris, considering Pitt’s trip to Notre Dame
next weelc '

Nliamistartedoutthegameinamanner
expected of the highly favored team ——- by
marching down the; ﬁeld and scoring a
touchdown on its ﬁrst drive. Miami had a
seven-play, 62-yard" drive, ﬁnished off with
Portis running into the. end zone from 4
yards out Kicker Todd Sievers missed the
extra point. ' ,

Pitt made   on the very
next play, when Torrie Cox rex:eived the
kickoﬁ". With a few good blocks and his own
ability at making tacklers miss, Cox ran for
56 yards and into Miami territory.

From, there, ﬁeshrnan running back
Raymond Kirkley took over and may have
been untouched by the highly regarded
Miami defense on runs of l2'and 30 yards.
Rutherford ran in fora score on ﬁrst and goal
at the 2—yard line. Nick Lotz’s kick was
good, and Pitt was ahead of Miami for the
ﬁrst and only time in the game, at 7-6.

“It was great to see Raymond start so
well,” Harris said “He had a pretty good
night.” Kirkley ﬁnished with 93 yards on 19
carries.

But as fast as Pitt got down the ﬁeld on
the drive, they faltered just as quickly.

On Miami’s next set of downs, Pitt’s
inability to tackle was once again on display.
Miami got down to the Pitt l-yard line, and
Portis rushed in from there, putting the
Hurricanes ahead, 13-7. —

Running back Marcus Furrnan fumbled A

on Pitt’s next drive, only to have Brian
Beinecke intercept Miami quarterback Ken
Dorsey and get the ball back for Pitt. But
Priestley fumbled the ball away soon after-
ward and Dorsey took advantage, throwing
for a touchdown on the next play.

i At the beginning of the second quarter,
Pitt failed to capitalize on a blocked punt and
had a punting mishap of its own on the next
drive when Andy Lee was only able to punt
the ball 4 yards. Miami got a 24-yard ﬁeld
goal on its next drive.

The score stood at 23-7 at halftime.

Portis was in control when Miami got
the ball for the ﬁrst time in the third quarter
and once again rushed m from the l-yard
line.

Miami scored a ﬁeld goal on its next
possession. McGahee scored early in the
fourth quarter, and at this point, the game
was very obviously in Miami’s hands with
the score at 40-7.

Rutherford threw a 10-yard pass to tight
end Kris Wilson on Pitt’s next possession.
Miami answered with another ﬁeld goal. Pitt
closed out the scoring on its next possession,
when Rutherford rushed for his second
touchdown of the day with 15 seconds left in
the game. ‘ ‘

Lost in all of this is, any mention of
Biletnikolf Award winner Antonio Bryant,
whose status was questionable after being
injured in Pitt’s ﬁrst game against East
Tennessee State. Bryant’s:.iretum was silent
as he ﬁnished -with three catches for 39
yards.

“He made some recovery in the past
couple of days,” said Harris of the Heisman
trophy candidate. “He needs to get some
more practicing in. I know we’re better than
what we’re playing like right now.”

here. Let’s move forward and venture into
the future of Pitt football, rather than fail at
the hands of someone who could have had
potential but ir1 his ﬁfth year of college still
cannot put togeﬂier a complete half of foot-
ball.

Every student knows who can make the
big play. The athletic department has to
know that they have an extremely mar-
ketable player in Rutherford and every time
he steps onto the ﬁeld, people pay attention.
He’s athletic and conﬁdent and  well 
athletic. -

The “902l0” regime is over, so let’s
hand the ball to number 12 and see what he
can do. V

In Rod we trust.

News and he never really liked Brandon
