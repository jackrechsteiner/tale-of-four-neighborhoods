rankings

To the editor:

The April 5 UniversityTimes
reported that the University of
Pittsburgh School of Law’s
health law program “was ranked

12th of 13 listed” by U.S. News. _

This somewhatincomplete state-
ment might be thought to imply
that the program was next to
last.
This is not the case. Of the
180 ABA-accredited American
law schools eligible to be ranked,
175 provide data for the U.S.
News survey. Of those, accord-
ing to those at U.S. News who
performed the rankings, “be-
tween 50 and 65 schools” re-
ceived at least one vote from the
approximately 150 law profes-
sors chosen at random from all
professors who teach health law.
Thus it would be more accu-
rate to say that our health law
program ranked 12th out of 50
or 65, or even 175 law schools,
but not 12th out of 13.

(Editor’s note: The University
Times took its information from the
U.S. News ¢Z'?' World Report web
site report on the rankings, which
was more extensive than the pub-
lished report. In the published re-

port, only the top 10 health law
programs were listed.

As with all of its rankings, U.S.
News did not speciyy how many
health law programs existed or had
been considered when the programs
were ranked. Thus, the University
Times story indicated that Pitt’s

health law program “was ranked

12th of 13 listed” by U.S. News,
which is correct.

We appreciate Dean Herring
and Professor M eisel providing in-
formation on the health law

C,onfrnn‘l:ation
is not a
dirty word

To the editor:

I was much disturbed by the .

statements made by the three
recently‘ elected ofﬁcers of the
University Senate (University
Times, May 3, 2001). All agreed,
said.the reporter, that their styles
were “non-confrontational.” All
seemed adamant; all seemed to
agree with Professor Metzger
that “you have to collaborate with
the administration. Being con-
frontational is a mistake.” VVhen
I ﬁnished reading the article, I
had the feeling that somehow we
had entered into a new world, a
world in which confrontation had
become a dirty word, a word not
to be used either in mixed com-
pany or among civilized people.
I must seriously‘ object. I
would like to suggest that in deal-
ings with the administration, one
must watch and be aware both of
what they say and what they do.
I have too often seen administra-
tion make the statement: That is
the way we interpret it. Most
recently, I understand that a
clause in our retirement program
which said that a faculty member
may become a permanent part-
timer as he/she eased into retire-
ment was interpreted to mean
that he/she could do so for two
years. Permanent now means two
years. Would a faculty member
who objected —— say, a member
of the English department who

, believed, in some old fashioned

way, that words do have mean-
ing, and that the distortion of
language will lead to chaos -
would such a faculty member be
accused of being confronta-
tional? Of course. ‘But what of
the provost who made such a
decision? Could he be called ig-
norant of the meaning of words,
dictatorial, abusive of power? All
of these would be true; but if we

   

followed the advice of the three
newly elected ofﬁcers of the Sen-
ate, we would have to forbear
speaking truth to arrogant power
because to do so would be con-
frontational. I fear such advice.
Not onlyidoes it undermine the
purpose of the University — to
seek truth — but it is ‘stupid
politics. ,

In the real world, we have to

admit that the administration has. —

all the power and the faculty has
all the collegiality. VVhen ad-
ministration wishes, it does what
it will; that is its job —— to run the
University, to make sure that the «
doors are open every Monday
morning and stay open for that
week. We are all members of the
same enterprise, but we have dif-
ferent interests. The interest of
students is not the same as the
interest of staff; the interest of
staff is not the same as the inter-
est of faculty; the interest of fac-
ulty is not the same as the inter-
est of administration. Each has
its own set of interests. Some-
how, administration has man-
aged to convince people that
when faculty stand up for their
own interests, either by saying a
ﬁrm yes or a ﬁrm no to adminis-
tration, they are being confron-
tational. I really do resent the
diminishing and tarnishing of a
good word. Ifwe allow adminis-
tration to control the deﬁning
language of the discourse, we
have indeed lost the game. Rather
than kow—towing to adrninistra- '

tion and beginning by surren— -

dering, I would prefer a set of
ofﬁcers who are willingto state
that faculty have interests and
they are there to protect those
interests. If that me_ans working
with administration, ﬁne; if that
means being confrontational to
administration, ﬁne. But theywill
then be doing the job to which
they were elected. .

Pitt has no comment on report it
will study same-sex partner beneﬁts

Pitt has refused to comment
on a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
report that the University has
agreed to study extending health
beneﬁts to domestic partners of
its gay employees. ’

The Post-Gazette reported

May 9 that _plaintiffs in a ﬁve—.

year-old lawsuit seeking exten;
sion of health beneﬁts to same-
sex partners of employees have
agreed to temporarily suspend
litigation in exchange for cre-
ation of a University panel that

would make recommendations.

to Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg.

Announcement of the deal
was expected as early as May 10,
according to the Post-Gazette.
But no such announcement was
forthcoming as the University
Times went to press.

Pitt, the American Civil Lib-
erties Union (which represents
the seven plaintiffs) and plain-
tiffs themselves have either re-
fused to comment or have not
returned phone calls from the
University Times. ' I

Pitt chosen for Beckman Scholars Program

The Arnold and Mabel
Beckman Foundation has se-
lected Pitt for its Beckman Schol-
ars Program, which supports un-
dergraduate research in bio-
chemistry, chemistry, and bio-
logical and medical sciences.

‘Pitt’s first two Beckman
Scholars, both molecular biol-
ogy majors, were chosen earlier
this month: junior Robert]. Lee
and senior William 3H. McCoy

IV. Lee will work with Jeffrey
Brodsky of biological sciences
on “The Role of the Proteasome
in the Export of Proteins During
ER-Associated Protein Degra-
dation.-” McCoy will work in

~ Linda Jen—Jacobson’s biological

sciences lab on “An Energetic

Analysis of the Reduced Speci- -

ﬁcity Exhibited by the E192K .
Mutant of EcoRI Restriction En-
donuclease.” I

 

A few days after commencement I received a
copy of a memorandum from my department
requesting information from all faculty in the
department. The memorandum included the fol-
lowing: “Dr. Levine has requested Annual Re-
ports and Business Plans for each of the Schools of
the Health Sciences.” The requested information
was to assist the department in responding to Dr.
Levine’s request.

A On many occasions duri_ng the nearly 45 years I have spent at
the University of Pittsburgh, I have received information re-
quests to assist in the planning conducted by my department and
by GSPH. This recent communication was the ﬁrst that referred
to “business plans.” I had some questions. Is a “business plan”
different from the type of plans previously prepared‘ by my
department and GSPH? Is there a special signiﬁcance attached
to the term “business plan” that I should recognize? *

To gain some insight, I spoke ‘with a faculty member of the
Katz school. From what he told me it appears that, while there
are certainelemelnts that are generally found in a business plan,
there is not much substantive difference between a business plan
and what would be present in a university’s or other nonproﬁt
entity’ 5 strategic plan. In short, a business plan is a blueprint for

 

‘ how to get from an idea to something real; put another way, how

to get from where we are to where we want to be. It needs to be

realistic —— it should describe the product or service to be offered, ' .
7 identify markets and the methods for delivery of the product or

service, identify the sources of ﬁnancing and contain sound
revenue and expense estimates.

I have heard from faculty expressions of concern from time to
time about what is usually termed the increasing corporatization
of the University. One subject to which the term was appiied was
the practice of the Board of Trustees inawarding bonuses for the
performance to the ‘chancellor and certain other ofﬁcers of the
University when their compensation for the next year was being

set. That practice was not followed when the July 1, 2000—June‘.

30, 2001 compensation was set. In comments I made_in response
to questions from media representatives about those compensa-
tion decisions, I said that I and some other faculty
membersbelieved that awarding bonuses was not a good practice
for the University for several reasons, one of which was that it
made the University appear too much like an ordinary business
distributing a portion of its proﬁts. , ' , . . 7-
7 There are many references to failed business plans in what I
have read about the collapse of many of the dot-com companies.
The articles state that, at the height of the dot-com mania,
Venture capitalists were making large sums of money available to
entrepreneurs based only on their business plans, and these new
ventures often had no revenue at all, let alone net earnings. The
impression I gained was that a good many of the business plans
contained unreasonably, high expectations, if they were not
works of pure imagination, rather than anything grounded in
rational belief supported by evidence. The dot-com experience
indicates there is no magic in the words “business plan.” In my
‘opinion, calling a plan a business plan does not bestow any

particular aura to it. However, use of the term may represent *

changes in approach, purposes and ‘objectives from what has
been called planning in this academic environment previously.

If so, should not University ofﬁcials inform the Pitt commu-
nity why such a change in terminology is appropriate or even,
perhaps, necessary? If there is no substance to the change, is it
only a matter of style — an example of being trendy? Perhaps

, plans at the National Institutes of Health, where Dr. Levine was _

previouslyemployed, are called business plans.

. On a related note, for a good number of years there has been
a change of outlook underway in the public, nonproﬁt and
business sectors of our nation. Approximately 30 years ago an
individual who was then, and still is, a frequent consultant to
government agencies and ofﬁce holders, told me that a new
philosophy was evident in Washington. In brief, government
and nonproﬁts were being urged to behave in a much more
business—like way, and businesses were being told to accept
responsibilities to society, and to the communitiesgyvith which
they had direct relationships, and to focus less onithe bottom
1-ine. His view was that this transition would be difﬁcult, and
unlikely to occur. However, we see businesses taking more active
roles in what they consider public service. For example, Philip-

Morris Inc., has a set of advertisements describing that '

organization’s contributions through its employees and its ﬁ-
nancial resources to communities where it is located. Of course,
Philip-Morris has its business reasons for attempting to appear
enlightened.

Universities and other nonproﬁts are being urged to be
entrepreneurial. Pitt has certainly moved in that direction.

Entrepreneurship is much more likely to be possible in some‘
. schools and departments than others, because of the very nature

of the ﬁelds and activities of the faculty in those units. Perhaps
it is time to examine carefully how to maintain academic values

and, at the same time, incorporate lessons from the business —
environment where they can prove helpful in achieving the ’

University’s primary objectives. I have alreadytheard misgivings

expressed about inadequate attention being given to the impact

of entrepreneurship on the core functions of an academic unit.I

  3 . Cost of living raises for satisfactory work is

not primary goal of salary policy, Council told

. warding cost-of—liv—
ing raises to Univer-
’ sity employe_es who

do satisfactory work should be a
high priority, but it never has
been the primary goal of Pitt’s
salary policy, senior administra-
tors said last week. A

With Pitt salary budgets run-
ning only a percentage point or
two above inflation in recent
years, overemphasizing cpst—of—

' living raises can worsen payin-

equities for individuals and
hinderinstitutional progress,

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg"

and Provost James Maher told
Senate Council on May 7.

They disputed suggestions by '

some professors that the admin-
istration, in certain years (in-
cluding the last two ﬁscal years),
has violated the 1994 policy by
allocating lower-than-inﬂation
“maintenance of rea-l salary”
raises for satisfactory perfor-
mance.

The salary policy states that
the pool of money for salary
raises should be divided among
four components: 1) mainte-
nance of real salary for satisfac-
tory performance; 2) merit in-
creases for better—than—satisfac-
tory performance; 3) equity ad-
justments to overcome pay dis-
crepancies. apparently based on
factors such as gender, race and
salary compression (through
which newer hires get paid more

* -' their-ic”dntinuing«%employees+of
the same, or even higher, rank), '

and 4) market adjustments to
make Pitt salaries competitive.
According to the policy, “The
portion of the total pool devoted
to each of the four components
is determined by the chancellor,

A with the active participation of

the UPBC [University Planning
and Budgeting Committee], in
response to_ needs for each pur-
pose identiﬁed through the plan-
ningand budgeting system. The

1 size of the total pool forincreases
should be sufﬁciently large to ~-

provide adequate funds for all

‘four purposes.” 3

There’s the rub: Since the
salary policy took effect, the to-
tal pool has rarely, if ever, been
large enough to adequately fund

all four salary components, a fact

that the administration attributes
largely to stingy state appropria-
tion increases coupled with pres-
sure to hold down tuition hikes.
So, decisions must be made
— ultimately by the chancellor,
the policy acknowledges.
C “Where exactly you strike the

balance is obviously a judgment.

call,” Chancellor Nordenberg
said, “and it is not an easy judg-
ment call to make.” 1 V

For Pitt’s current ﬁscal year,

the administration increased the .

pool of money for faculty and
staff salaries by 4.5 percent.

Nordenberg divided the pool as ‘

‘follows:

0 2 percent distributed to re— 5 ”

sponsibility centers for mainte-
nance of salaries of employees
judged by their supervisors to
have done satisfactory work.

° 2 percent distributed to re-
sponsibility centers for merit,
market and equity adjustments.

0 0.5 percent allocated by the
provost and senior vice chancel-
lor_for Health Sciences to tar-
geted units to meet merit and
market needs.

According to the Senate’s
budget policies committee
(BPC), allocating /only 2 percent
for salary maintenance was un-
fair and unjustiﬁed in a year when

_ Pitt’s salary budget increased by

4.5 percent, and following a year
in which inﬂation as measured
by the Consumer Pricelndex

<..»:<Went«»up:by 2:71 ;percent..: - _
“A maintenance component.

of only 2 percent assures that
some faculty performing satis-
factorily will receive cuts in real
pay,” BPC chairperson Philip K.

Wion complained in a Sept. 5, —

2000, letter to Nordenberg.
“Even worse, it makes it highly
likely that some faculty nomi-
nally receiving merit increases
will also in fact suffer real cuts.”
. Sensing administrative resis-
tance to automatic cost—of-‘living
raises for merely competent em-
ployees, BPC recently proposed
basing inﬂation raises on “meri-
torious” rather than “satisfac-
tory” job performance. But Fac-
ulty Assembly on May 1 rejected
'BPC’s proposal. See May 3 Uni-
versity Times. .
Despitethe rejection, BPC’s

Phrasing attributed to Pitt
salary, policy was UPBC’s

According to Pitt’s salary
policy, faculty and staff judged
by their supervisors to have done
satisfactory work should receive
cost-of-‘living raises equal to the
previous year’s inﬂation rate.

But, contrary to a story in the

” May 3 . University Times, the
policy does not specify that cost- .
of—living*raises may be less than =

the full rate-of inﬂation only “in
years when salary increase funds
are severely, constrained.”
'That’ language actually ap-
peared in a 1999 statement ap-
proved by the University Plan-
ning and Budgeting Commit-
tee. UPBC, chaired by the pro-
vost, is a group of faculty, staff
and administrators that advises
the senior administration on an-

nual salary raises, among other
issues.

,At its May 18, 1999, meeting,
UPBC unanimously approved a
statement ‘detailing its under-

standing of how, Pitt’s salary ~
policy is supposed to work./'

Among other things, the state-
ment noted that .“the policy is
ﬂexible; in years when salary in-
crease funds are severely con-
strained, the cost—of-living ad’-
justment can be less than the full
rate of inﬂation, so that merit,
market and equity needs can also

be addressed.”

Committee members adopted ,
. the statement following a nearly

year—long UPBC review of the

salary policy.

statement that the current salary
pool division represented the
biggest gap since 1994 between
inﬂation (2.7 percent) and Pitt’s
“maintenance of real salary”
component (2.0 percent).

But Nordenberg and Provost
Maher. argued ' for ﬂexibility in
interpreting the salary policy. If
the bulk of the salary pool goes

‘ toward University-wide inﬂation

raises, year after year, deans and
department chairs will ﬁnd it dif-
ﬁcult to address salary inequi-
ties, reward merit and compete
for high—quality employees, the
administrators said.
Nordenberg said he aims to
give unit heads ﬂexibility in dis-
tributing salary funds.

ing at a good level but ﬁve are
superstars,” the chancellor said.
“I don’t know whether there are
a half-dozen people who . . .com—
pared to their peers, really aren’t
being treated fairly, or whether
there are none, or whether there
are a dozen.

“To the extent that there is a
measure of ﬂexibility in merit,
market and equity allocations,
then the people who do know
what that department needs to

. be fair and to appropriately re-

ward 'the contributions of its
people...are able to do so.”
Maher_commented, “I don’t
think that‘we should be saying
that this policyhas not been taken
seriously. In fact, I think this has
been taken very seriously” — so
much so, he said, that the admin-
istration has been allocating less
money for market and equity in-
creases than it would prefer.
BPC chairperson VV1on, who
helped. to draft the salary policy,
agreed that the administration
has followed the letter of the
policy, if not its underlying spirit
that employees who do a good

job should not suffer cuts in real
pay when such losses are avoid-
able. . _ ‘

Walter Goldburg, of physics
and astronomy, asked Norden-
berg and Maher whether they
believe the salary policy is keep-
ing Pitt from improving at the
rate they would like to see.

Neither administrator would

go that far.

“I would say,” Nordenberg
replied, “that my overall feeling
is that we are all in this together,
trying to move the University
forward” with fewer resources
than we would like for salaries
and for other things.’And, as]irn
[Maher] suggested, there might
well be somewhat different deci-
sions that we would make about

, allocating these dollars if there

were no salary policy and no rec-
ommendations coming from the
UPBC,” which is a provost-
chaired group of faculty, staff,
students and administrators that
advises the senior administration.

“But Iwould say, by and large,
that we each feel the discussion
has been substantive, thoughtful
and not self-centered within that
group, and that we have_tried to
take account of the [UPBC’s]
recommendations in making our
own decisions.”

Last summer, UPBC recom-
mended a 2.4 percent for salary
maintenance to reward satisfac-
tory performance (less than the
previous year’s 2.7 percent inﬂa-
tion rate) but the committee was
assuming a 4.0 percent increase
in the salary pool. The chancel-
lor ended up approving a 4:5
percent increase in the pool, with
2 .0 for salary maintenance. ‘

A At last September’s Senate
Council meeting, BPC chairper-
son Wion thanked Nordenberg
for the added 0.5 percent, but

pointed out: “The pool got _

larger. The maintenance com-
ponent got smaller.” _
Economics professor Jack
Ochs noted last Week that the
salary policy’s basic objective is
to improve program quality by
enabling Pitt to recruit and re-
tain high—quality faculty and staff.
Yet, University revenues are in-
sufﬁcient to fully implement the

salary policy.

“This has been true fora long
time,” Ochs said. “This suggests
that we may have under our
umbrella more programs than
we can, in fact, operate at the
level of quality that we aspire all

of our programs to have.”

Ochs asked: How far along is
Pitt in reshaping programs “such
that, in the near future, we may
ﬁnd ourselves not being con-
strained in the way we have over
the past decade?” '

Nordenberg reiterated that
Pitt’s budgetary constraints, in-
cluding minimal increases in base

- budget funding fromlthe state,
“are not peculiar to this institu- I

tion. They are quite "common
throughout public higher edu-
cation in America today.” '

The University planning pro-
cess and Pitt’s most recent fac-
ulty early retirement plan have
contributed to reshaping some
units, promoting higher quality
and economic efﬁciency, the
chancellor said. “But if you’re
asking whether there is a short-
term solution that will take us
away from these struggles, I don’t
see it.” '

“How about medium-term? ” ’

Ochs pursued.

“We work on this on as many ,

fronts as we can,” Nordenberg
said. For example, the creation
of endowed chairs and profes-
sorships through Pitt’s current
capital campaign should free up
funds for academic programs, he
said.
Psychology professor James
Holland noted that Pitt senior
‘administrators are the people
ultimately responsible for secur-
ing" a‘d‘eq'uate funding for the
University. If Pitt chronically
lacks money to fund all four com-

ponents of its salary policy,‘

maybe the senior administration
deserves a less-than—satisfactory
job evaluation, Holland said.

“Although,” he added, “I have
a feeling that those [Pitt trust-
ees] who determine their sala-
ries will not respond appropri-
ately to that evaluation.”

,Nick Bircher, of the medical
school, said one danger of merit-
based salary increases is that
raises for faculty and staff are
determined by department chairs

1 and deans who annually evaluate

those employees.

“To the extent that the medi-
cal school can be viewed as an
experiment in deregulation ——
that is; determining the merit of
an individual is-at the chair’s dis-
cretion — then the potential for
abuse is not an unreasonable
fear,” Bircher said.

_To avoid such abuse, and re-
sulting demoralization‘ among
faculty and staff, Pitt must closely
regulate the employee evalua-
tion process, he said.

Maher replied that, for the
last three years, the Provost’s

ofﬁce has reviewed 10 percent of V

each school’s annual salary raise
letters for each faculty rank, ran-

domly selecting names of faculty .

members. 5 ~ — _
“Vice Provost [for Faculty
Affairs] Andy Blair has been go-
ing through these letters, get-
ting back to the deans, giving
them feedback as to the quality
oftheletters and anysteps needed

said. Blair’s ﬁndings ﬁgure into

ations, the provost said.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Report details subsidy of athletics:

itt subsidized its in-

tercollegiate athletics

program by nearly
$11 million last year, according
to a study by the University’s
Ofﬁce of Budget and Control-
ler.

The $11 million ﬁgure in-
cluded both direct and indirect
support. ’

Direct support attributed to
athletics includes coaches’ sala-
ries, travel and business expenses,
and student ﬁnancial aid, among
other operating expenses. For
the ﬁscal year that ended June
30, 2000, direct expenses ex-
ceeded direct revenue (from
ticket and concession sales, TV
and radio money, NCAA/Big
East revenue sharing and other
sources) by $8.21 million.

Indirect support includes
building depreciation, physical
plant costs, administrative over-
head and other expenses.» The
indirect-support subsidy for last
year was $2.77 million,

The annual cost study, which
is required by the NCAA, also
incorporated gifts to athletics
($94,773), income from camps
and clinics ($6,785) and unspeci-

ﬁed “other restricted revenues”

- ($2 62,63 5) last year.

The department declined to
comment on the report. But ath-
letics administrators have argued
in previous years that the lower,
direct revenuel expense numbers
are more accurate than total rev-
enue/ expenses in reﬂecting Pitt
ﬁnancial support of their pro-
gram. A
Last year, FY 2000, the
University’s total subsidy of ath-
letics was $10.98 million (up from
$8 million in FY 1996, the year
that Pitt began publicly report-
ing athletics budget data). Di-
rect expenses exceeded direct
revenues by $8.2 million last year
(up from $4.87 million in FY
1996) .

Last year, Pitt subsidized its
football program — one of the
two so—called revenue-produc-
ing NCAA sports —— by $1.18
million (total support) or
$215,598 (counting only direct
expenses and revenues), depend-
ing on which calculation you use.

Men’s basketball, the other
“revenue—producing” sport, cost
the University either $465,151
(total) or $178,772 (direct) more

per, but this is a ludicrous state-
ment,” Colwell continued.
“ [Cassing] also indicates that fac-
ulty and students are the Uni-
versity. If it were not for the
efforts of staff, faculty might not
be able to participate in the
shared governance process.
“How can staff believe that
there is a shared governance pro-
cess when the leader of the fac-
ulty, Senate openly makes such
comments? I really believe he
owes staff an apology.”
Cassing, in an e-mail to the
University Times, replied: “I
would like to thank Rich, and
several hundred others, for re-
minding me that the staff plays

president-elect

an essential role in achieving the
mission of the University. I know
that they are a talented group
coping with complex problems
and I hope we all appreciate their
value. I do, and I apologize for
giving any other impression in
my comments to the University
Times.” ,

Ironically (or predictably,
given the divergence of opinions
at universities), an emeritus fac-
ulty member has accused Cassing
and other newly elected Senate
ofﬁcers of taking an overly con-
ciliatory stance toward Pitt’s ad-
ministration.

than it generated in revenue.
Pitt’s direct subsidy of its
women’s basketball team was
nearly 10 times that of its men’s
team: $1.73 million. The total
subsidy was nearly $1.9 million.
The :University’s total sub-
sidy of its non—re_venue produc-

direct subsidy of those sports was
$7.8 million.
CI

Among the revenue attrib-

utedto the Department of Ath-
letics last year was a $1.3 million
“student seating allocation.”

This money was transferred ,
from the Ofﬁce of Student Af— 4

fairs to athletics to cover the dif-
ference between a full season
ticket price and the discounted
price paid by students for foot-
ball and basketball tickets.
“This process has been in
place at the University for nearly
30 years and is consistent with
NCAA reporting guidelines,”
according to a report prepared
for the University Planning and

Budgeting Committee (UPBC), ~

anradvisory group of Pitt faculty,
staff and administrators.

Even so, the $1.3 million
came out of Pitt educational and
general operating funds, noted
Philip K. Wion, an English pro-
fessor who serves on UP-BC and
chairs the University Senate’s

‘budget policies committee.

“The $1.3 million is not in-
come generated by the athletics
department,‘ which is what you
might, assume’ when you see it

Now you see it...

listed as revenue,” Wion said.

For years, the Senate’s bud-
get policies committee has scru-
tinized Pitt athletics ﬁnances.
Wion commented: “During the
year covered by this report, the
football team was playing its
home games atThree Rivers Sta-
dium and the men’s basketball
team was playing its next—to—last
home season at the [6,800-seat]
Fitzgerald Field House.

“We can hope that, as our
sports teams continue to im-
prove, and when the" football
team begins playing at the
Steelers’ new stadium and the*
basketball program moves into
its new home at the Petersen
Center [which will include a
12,5 00-seat arena], the athletics
department will generate more
revenue andthe University’ s sub-
sidy can be reduced.”

Ballot initiatives: The wrong way
to create laws, columnist insists

nquestionably, there
is distrust and cyni-
cism toward the U'.S.

system of representative govem—
ment, according to a prominent

national political pundit. But the .

most popular “solution” to this
problem is moving the country
in the wrong direction, away
from its founding principles and
potentially into a system of un-
just laws.

“The widespread preference
for writing laws by ballot initia-
tives, rather than the mechanism
we all learned from our high
school civic class of passing a bill
in one legislative house and then
in another and having it reviewed’
by the governor before it be-
comes law,” risks undermining
the authority and legitimacy of
the electoral process, said David

‘S. Broder, in a lecture titled “De-

mocracy Derailed: The Degra-
dation of the American Electoral
System.”

Broder, a national political
correspondent for The Wash-
ington Post and a Pulitzer Prize

winner for distinguished com— .

mentary, spoke to a packed house
at Benedum Auditorium May 1 5
as part of the University Honors
College American Experience
lecture series.

“The founders of this coun-
try had an enormous respect for
law,” Broder said. “They believed
that this Wcountry should have
‘§g”€5i7“efiirn"’eiit”t)fi1aws: and "not of
persons. They recognized that

, this was essential to organized

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1

society. But they also recognized
that law can, and often does, re-
strict our range of individual free-
doms. And they made it deliber-
ately very difficult to pass addi-
tional laws without consensus.”
Direct ballot initiatives,
which appear to be responsible
on the surface, ignore the system
of checks and balances funda-

mental to this country/s overall-

strength, Broder said.

Spawned during the populist
and progressive movements in
the latter half of the 19th cen-
tury, the mechanism of ballot
initiatives quickly was adopted
by half the states and many cit-
ies, he said. ‘ .-

“Initially, the mechanism
worked as the reformers had
hoped,” including regulating
monopolies, railroads and banks;
limiting taxation; enfranchising
women and, especially, circum-
navigating corrupt legislators.

“After World War I, the prac-
tice fell into disuse,” Broder said.
“But Proposition 13 in Califor-
nia” — where two private citi-
zens wanted to keep legislators
from spending the state’s sur-
plus — “brought it back to life
and today it is wildly, wildly
popular in the states where it is
available.”

Broder said most polls indi-
cate that 70-80 percent ofAmeri—

cans favor having laws made” by

‘ballot initiatives rather than poli-
ticians. Some 60—plus percent fa-
vor a national ballot initiative
process. .

In Oregon alone, Broder said,

..there were 26,separate ballot ini-

tiatives in the last election. The
process is so popular that it has
branched out into an industry,
including lawyers who draft the
initiatives into statutory lan-
guage; pollsters who explore
public attitudes to see what kind
of appeal would be most effec-
tive in passing -or defeating an
initiative, and campaign Consult-
ants, who, Broder said, ‘f. love it,

even more than they enjoy can— p

didate campaigning.” -;As one
consultant told Broder, “The
wonderful thing about it is that
initiatives don’t have spouses.”
With this initiative industry
has come an enormous growth
in.spending to support it. The
consequence of this, he_said, is
that the only people who can use
the initiative process effectively
are special interest groups that
have access to large amounts of
money, or individual million-

aires. .

Broder offered three other
reasons that the ballot initiative
process caused him concern.

“First of all, the history of
initiatives is ﬁlled with. unin-
tended consequences. Courts
have said there must be only one
subject per initiative". In the po-
litical world, we rarelyhave the
luxury of voting on a single sub-
ject. With legislation, almost all
the choices are trade-off
choices.” .

The difference is signiﬁcant,
he said, citing one of the most

Dvid Broder

group prior_to his May 1 5 Ameri-
can Experience lecture.

'.But how much longer, he
wondered aloud, will newspa-
pers such as the Post —— and
customers who buy papers in
printed form — be willing to
subsidize Internet operations
enabling e-readers to get their
news for free?

Top executives atThe~Wash-
ington Post are urgently debat-
ing such issues, Broder said, but

he admitted: “At my level, we,_

really have no clue where we’re
going to be 10' years from now.”

Demographic surveys show
an alarming drop-off in newspa-
per readership among people
under age 30, a generation that
was suckled on TV and the
Internet. “We don’t know where
they’re going to turn for news,”
Broder said.

Broder said publishers and
editors of the Post, The New
York Times and other major

dailies assume there will con-_

tinue to be a market, electroni-
cally and/ or in printed form, for
responsible news reporting and
commentary, despite the rise of
Internet rumor-mongers such as
Matt Drudge.

One downside of Internet
news is that some readers ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to differentiate among
trivia, speculation and genuine
news, Broder said. “Another
thing is that, because readers can
pick and choose precisely what
they want to read, they lose that
serendipity that you get with a
newspaper, where a headline or
photo may catch your eye” and
open up a whole new area of
interest, he said. ‘ :

Broder, a 40-year newspaper
veteran, said he can recall when
The Washington Post still en-
forced an iron rule: N 0 cameras
allowed in the newsroom. The
Post refused to waive its rule
even during the ﬁlming of the
1976 movie version of “All the
President’s Men.” Filmmakers
wereforcedto build a replica in
Hollywood of the Post news-
room. -

“Today, we have a perma-

   

popular ballot initiatives, the‘

“three-strike” issue. “Anyone
who commits three felonies, you
lock the doors, and never see
him on the outside again. Every-
where, it passed overwhelmingly,
and why not? If you have the
choice to say a guy is going to be
in jail the rest of his life or back
out on the street to threaten your
family, you would prefer ail. The
unintended consequence of that
is that if you’re going to lock
them up for life, you’re going to
need a helluva lot of jail cells,”
requiring the state to build jails
with money that cannot then go
to schools or highways.
“Voters were never asked:
‘Would you rather build jails or
schools and highways?” Broder
pointed out. '
“Secondly: Is a narrow ma-
jority on a particular day as good
as broad consensus over a long

period of time? This was brought .

forcibly to my attention in Or-
egon on the issue of physician-
assisted suicide. Talking with
people on both sides of that is-
sue, I got a pretty clear sense of
how deeply felt the intellectual
debates and the emotional argu-

  Broder discusses changes in journalism

‘VV

‘ nent television camera platform

set up in one corner of the news—'
room,” Broder said. “All day
long, reporters go before the
camera to talk about stories
they’re working on.” These up-
dates are broadcast on CNN,
the Post’s web site and other
electronic outlets. ‘
The Post’s 1 p.m. deadline
for what Broder called its “trun-
cated, mid—day Internet edition”
has become just as crucial to re-
porters and editors as the paper’s
regular press deadline, he said.
But for all of the technologi-

.cal developments Broder has

witnessed, he said the biggest
change in journalism during his
career has beenthe dramatic in-
crease in the number of women
in the news business.
“Journalism is rapidly becom-
ing a woman’s ﬁeld,” he said,

- noting that women comprise the

majority of journalism school
students today. Broder said he
welcomes the change.

Women reporters tend to be
betterlisteners than men, they’re
less likely to interrupt during
interviews, and are generally “less
prone to get conned and psycho-
logically more astute at reading
character,” Broder said.

He cited a revealing incident
from last September’s U.S. Sen-
ate election debate between
Hillary Rodham Clinton and her

, GOP opponent, Rick Lazio.

Early in the debate, Lazio
marched over to Clinton’s lec-
tern and waved a piece of paper
in her face, demanding that she
sign a pledge to forswear soft
money contributions. Lazio’s
condescending action backﬁred,
especially among women voters.
Broder said his female col-
leagues were quicker than he 
his fellow male reporters_were t'o
spot this as the turning point in
the debate, and a key moment in
the campaign. _
Broder made his remarks dur-
ing a by—invitation discussion

and administrators prior to’ his

Outbound lanes from Down-
town on the Boulevard of the
/Allies will be closed beginning
May 22 at 9 a.m. while the state
Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) repairs a 1.6-mile
stretch of roadway.

PennDOT will repave the
Boulevard between the Liberty

anchor the road to the hillside.
Outbound lanes are expected to
remain closed until January, ac-

Inbound traffic between
Moultrie Street and the Liberty

lane during the project. There
will be intermittent total closure

Oakland-bound drivers will

Parkway East inbound to use for
equipment storage and staging
during the project. This one-
lane, quarter-mile stretch of the

Electrical outage affects 20 buildings

An electrical equipment fail-
ure May 11 at the Posvar Hall
main circuitryvault caused much
of the lower Pittsburgh campus
to lose power between 3 and 9
p.m., according to the Ofﬁce of
Facilities Management.

The following buildings were
affected by the temporary out-
age: Posvar Hall, the Law Build-
ing, Mervis Hall, WilliamlPitt
Union, Litchﬁeld Towers A, B
and C, Schenley Quadrangle
(Amos, Brackenridge, Bruce,
Holland and McCormick halls),

Lawrence Hall, Hillman Libra'ry,

Frick Fine Arts, Cathedral of

Learning, Belleﬁeld Hall, Craig
Hall, Heinz Chapel and Stephen
Foster Memorial.

Although the electrical equip-
ment was stabilized, further work
is required, Facilities Manage-
ment ofﬁcials said. Over the next
month, Facilities Management
will schedule temporary outages

A at the affected buildings.

A Occupants will be notiﬁed in
advance of the dates when the
outages will occur. I

RESEARCH NOTES in ‘

Pitt faculty
present results
at Transplant
2001 meeting
Clinical and basic science re-
search ﬁndings of more than 65

A studies were presented by Pitt

School of Medicine researchers
at Transplant 2 001,-the oint sci-
entiﬁc meeting of the American
Society of Transplant Surgeons
and the American Society of
Transplantation.

Highlights of the ﬁndings,
presented May 13-16 in Chi-
cago, included the following:

Lab studies indicate
possible treatment for
tumors in transplant patients
Post—transplant proliferative
disorder (PTLD) is a complica-
tion associated with the Epstein
Barr Virus (EBV), a virus that
about 90 percent of the world
population eventually, will be
exposed to. But many children
and young adults have not yet

been exposed to_ the virus, and’

because they must take drugs to
controlrejection, they are espe-
cially susceptible to the virus and
the consequence of PTLD.

If an EBV—negat:ive transplant
patient is exposed to the virus or

A -receives an organ that is positive

for EBV, B cells in the patient’s
lymphoid tissue are likely to grow

wildly to form cancerous tumors.

Results of laboratory studies
reported by Diana M. Metes,

. research assistant professor of

surgery at the Thomas E. Starzl
Transplantation Institute, could

strategies to prevent or treat
PTLD in transplant patients
whose immune systems have not
been educated to ﬁght EBV.~
Using blood samples from
healthy individuals, she studied
how certain immune system cells

reacted when they were exposed’

to PTLD-like tumor cells. If the

individual had previous exposure '

to EBV, speciﬁc types of im-

.mune system T cells — those

that ﬁght infections — tended to
be much more active. Interest-
ingly, when the PTLD-like cells
were plunked into an environ-
ment with no EBV immune sys-
tem recognition, the T cells re-
acted only in the presence of
certain cytokines, proteins that
can stimulate cell activity.

Introducing "these T cells J

primed to recognize EBV into
patients at risk for PTLD could

" allow their immune systems to

effectively ﬁght the virus if they

were to receive an EBV—positive ,

organ- or were unknowingly ever
exposed to ghe virus.

Small intestines exposed
to radiation less likely
tobe rejected

The majority of small intes-
tine transplant recipients expe-
rience at least one episode of
rejection within the ﬁrst month
of transplantation. But in a group
of patients whose donor organs
were exposed to radiation just
prior to transplantation, the in-
cidence was practically zero.

Rejection was observed in
only one patient out of 13 in the
study, reported Kareem Abu-
Elmagd, associate professor of
surgery and director of the In-
testinal _ Rehabilitation and
Transplant Center at Pitt’s Starzl

Transplantation Institute.

The strategy involves expos-
ing the donor intestine to a single
low dose of irradiation, trans-
planting the organ and then de-
livering donor bone marrow in-

fusions. The radiation aims to
kill mature donor immune sys-
tem cells that the small bowel is

saturated with so that the donor '

organ is less likely to serve as a
target for the recipient’s immune
' system.

The donor bone marrow in-

fusion enhances a condition
called chimerism, whereby cer-
tain types of donor and recipient
cells learn to coexist peacefully.

Chimerism" is believed to inﬂu-

ence the long—term survival of

- the transplanted organ. Three
of ﬁve patients in a control group
each had at least one serious epi-
sode of rejection.

Researchers identify,
subtype of cell that —
promotes graft acceptance
In one of the few studies of its
kind, researchers from the Starzl
Transplantation Institute have
found that a subtype of dendritic
cell plays a key role in prevent-
ing organ rejection and may be
associated with transplant toler-
ance, the long-term survival of a
transplanted organ without the
need for immunosuppressant
drugs.
The ﬁndings are signiﬁcant

because dendritic cells, a rare 9'

type of white blood cell that is
_ present in all tissues, have been
thought only to be involved in
prompting the rejection process.
" lTh'e'y do this’by identifying and
presenting antigens, or foreign
substances, to other immune sys-

tem cells that are programmed

to destroy the antigen.
Butsome dendritic cells ap-
parently regulate the immune
response, determining that a
' frontline attack byT cells canbe
unwarranted. '

Peta]. O’Connell, a visiting

research instructor worlcing with
Angus W. Thomson, reported
that a pre—transplant infusion of
lymphoid dendritic cell subtypes
derived from tissue such as the
spleen allowed for prolonged
survival in a mouse heart trans-
plant model, even without ’ the
use of drugs to control rejection.
In contrast, myeloid dendritic
cells accelerated the rejection
response. O’Connell believes
that ‘the lymphoid-derived den-
dritic cells somehow disarm im-
mune system T cells from doing

their part to attack the donor‘

organ by either causing their
death or limiting their prolifera-
tion. The researchers plan to see
if these “good” dendritic cells
are present in liver and kidney
transplant recipients who are off
allimmunosuppression as part
of a larger effort under the direc-
tion of Thomson and Adriana
Zeevito’identifylaboratorypro—
ﬁles and tests‘ consistent with
tolerance.

Gene therapy technique tested
in animals prevents common
type of donor organ injury
Cold ischernia — when the
donor organ is without a blood
supply — accounts for a signiﬁ-
cant portion of transplanted or-
gan injury. This injury is com-
pounded when oxygenated blood

is reintroduced into ‘the organ

during surgery. Both situations_

somehow cause cells in the or-
gan to self-destruct, therefore
compromising the function of
the graft.

_  molecule that resides on
the cell membrane is believed to
play a key role in this process.
Under certain conditions its ac-
tivation induces a pathway to
death by calling in a cascade of
enzymes that break down the
cell’s nucleus. _ . 9

Reporting on animal studies
with promising clinical implica-
tions, researchers at the Starzl
Transplantation Institute ob-
served activation of this molecule
in kidneys deprived of oxygen.
But when they delivered a sub-
stance especially manipulated to
target the molecule’s' genetic‘
structure, the gene therapy tech-
nique successfully disarmed.its
ability to signal the cell death
process, and signiﬁcant ischemic
injury was prevented. '

According to Linlin jMa, a

"research fellow working with

John Fung, the technique shows
promise as a way of preventing

ischemic injury in donor organs. ,

Genetic profiles of .

hepatocellular cancers

can predict recurrence

after liver transplantation
Patients classiﬁed as having

‘stage IV liver cancers do not

qualify for liver transplantation,
but based on an analysis of 69

patients transplanted for hepa-
tocellular carcinoma at Pitt since
1981, some patients who are de-
nied transplantation today be-
cause they meet criteria for ad-
vanced disease mightactually be
good candidates for transplanta-
tion and enjoy tumor—free long-
term survival. 1 '
Andy Bonham, assistant pro-
fessor of surgery, reported , that
six of the patients they followed
— four of whom were trans-
planted 12 years ago —— who
would have been denied trans-
plantation under today’,s guide-
lines, were found to have genetic

characteristics that would pre-

dict a more benign course than
the classic staging would sug-
gest. .
All are alive and well with n

recurrence of their cancers de-
spite the fact that at the time of
transplantation they had very
large tumors or multiple tumors
in both lobes of the liver. Using

tests to analyze the presence and

mutations of_ tumor genes,
Bonham reported that these pa-
tients’ tumors were actually dis-
tinct early stage, non—aggressive
ones. , , i I
The technique was able to
identify these six patients out of
39 classiﬁed as stage IV. Overall,
their analysis of the 69 patients
found that patients‘with more
genetic mutations in their tu-
mors were more likely to have
recurrence and short-term sur-
vival. Fewer mutations, even in
situations with several tumors,
corresponded with less of a

chance of recurrence and longer

‘ survival. Seventeen of the 69

patients are still alive. Perform-
ing such tests on patients as they
are being evaluated for trans-
plantation could help guide treat-
ment strategies, reported
Bonham.

Drug shows promiseﬁzr
children who develop

_ post—transplant tumors

Pediatric transplant patients
are especially at risk for develop-
ing a serious complication called
post—transplant lymphoprolif-
erative disorder (PTLD),
whereby certain cells of the
patient’s immune system prolif-
erate to form tumors that re-
semble a type of cancer called
lymphoma. ,

Standard treatment involves
temporarily reducing or elimi-
nating the doses of drugs that are
taken to suppress the immune
system and prevent organ rejec-
tion. Some children fail to re-
spond to this therapy, and their
tumors can prove fatal. Many of
these children face deadly con-
sequences if the ‘balancing act
between protecting the organ
from rejection and treating the
cancerous tumors is done with-
out precision.

Steven Webber, associate
professor of pediatrics and medi-
cal director of the heart and lung
transplant program at Children’s
Hospital, reported preliminary
results of an eight—center study

rituximab was effective for the
majority of children who were
not responsive to conventional
treatment for PTLD. Tumors
disappeared in 14 of 16 children
in the study—recipients of heart,
lung, liver, kidney or small bowel
transplants. The drug targets a
speciﬁc molecule on B cells, the
cells that grow wildly and de-
velop into tumors.

Researchers flst
to view viral
DNA ‘ballet’

The complex process in
which hundreds of protein mol-
ecules assemble around a single
DNA molecule into a virus is
like an intricately choreographed
ballet, say Pitt researchers who
announced in the April 27 issue

- of Science thatthey are the ﬁrst

to wimess one of the main se-
quences of this microscopic
dance in high resolution.

Roger Hendrix and Robert
Duda, members of the Pitts-
burgh Bacteriophage Institute
and Pitt’s biological sciences
department, are studying how
viruses are assembled. They are
collaborating with colleagues
from the National Institutes of
Health, the Institut de Biologie
Structurale and the Scripps Re-
search Institute.

Researchers studied the bac-
terial virus, HK97, and its pre-
cursor particle, or procapsid,
using cryoelectron microscopy
and X—ray crystallography, and
were able for the ﬁrst time to see
at high resolution some of the
proteins’ movements.

“Coordinated like dancers in
a ballet, the proteins initially as-
semble into a loosely organized
structure, then progressively slip,

slide, wiggle and change their,

shapes to produce a tightly in-
tertwined and remarkably tough

structure,” Hendrix said.
Viruses have been likened to
tiny spaceships that carry virus
genes from the cell where they
were created to the next cell the

.virus infects. The proteins that

surround the DNA of the virus
have two jobs: They must pro-
tect the DNA during transit, and
they must deliver the DNA in-
tact through the defenses of the
cell in the act of infection.

“Once we understand in‘ de-
tail how viruses get assembled
from their parts, we can start to
think about how we might use
that knowledge to sabotage the
life cycles,” Duda said.

“This should open the door‘

for a lot of biologists,” said
Hendrix. “Even though we’re
looking at the behavior of only
one particular protein of one
particular bacterial _virus, what
we learn should be applicable to
understanding lots of other pro-
teins that carry out important
reactions in the cell.”

l\Ieurosurgeons
studying
substitute for
spinal fusion
bone graft

Pitt neurosurgeons are study-
ing a bone graft substitute to
determine if it can promote bone
growth following spinal fusion
surgery for lower back pain
caused by degenerative disc dis-
ease.

The randomized, multi—cen—
ter research study will enroll 370
patients nationally‘ with about
40 patients being enrolled at
UPMC Presbyterian Hospital.

The material is called Healos
Bone Graft Substitute. Healos is
a mineralized collagen matrix“
manufactured by Orquest, Inc.,
of Mountain View, Calif., with

Minneapolis—based Sulzer

RESEARCH NOTES

Spine—Tech as distributor and
sponsor of the clinical study.

“This study will determine
the safety and efﬁcacy of this
new osteoconductive material,”
said William Welch, associate
professor of neurological surgery
andprimary investigator of the
study at UPMC.

Between each of the 24verte—
brae of .the human spine is a
vertebral disc, comprised of car-
tilage-like material that separates
the vertebrae and allows ﬂexibil-
ity of movement. Injury, aging

or repeated stress can produce

degenera.tive_ disc disease —- dry-
ing out or collapse of the disc ——
which can lead to excessive mo-
tion in the spine, inﬂammation
of the nerves in and around the
spine, nerve dysfunction and se-
vere, debilitating pain in the back,
arms and legs.

Spinal fusion is an accepted
surgical method of treatment for
lower back pain. Over the" past
ﬁve years, manufacturers have
developed FDA-approved tita-
nium alloy cage—like products,
which have been shown to alle-
viate lower back pain by pro-
moting fusion between the ver-
tebrae. A

“These devices are placed
between the lumbar vertebral
bodies after the discs have been
surgically removed. The cages
are essentially hollow screws with

holes drilled into the walls, which _

are then ﬁlled with bone taken
from the iliac crest of the patient’s
hip. Over-a period of months to
years, bone grows across the ver-

tebrae and through the cagesto ‘

form-a solid fusion,” Welch said.
“Healos, if found to be safe and
effective, would potentially
eliminate the need to take bone
from the patient’s own hip for
use during spinal surgery, and
may accelerate the bone fusion

one of the world’s leading soci-
eties in the ﬁeld of voiding dys-
function and incontinence. The
awardwas presented for a study
of urinary incontinence in people
over the age of 60.

The division of geriatric
medicine at Pitt is one of the
largest and is considered to be
one-of the best academic geriat-
ric divisions in the United States.
It was recently ‘named a national

III trial data reported at the an-

nual meeting of the American

Society of Clinical Oncology.’
The study,‘presented by
Chandra P. Belani, professor
of medicine and co—director of
the University of Pittsburgh

Cancer Institute’s Lung Cancer _

Program, showed that patients

who were treated with docetaxel

and cisplatin survived signiﬁ-
cantly longer than those who
received combination therapy
with vinorelbine and cisplatin, a
standard regimen used to treat
advanced NSCLC.

The median survival for the
docetaxel/cisplatin cohort was
10.9 months versus 10 months
for the vinorelbine/cisplatin co-
hort. The one—and two-year sur-
vival rates were 46 percent and
2 0 percent versus 42 percent and
14 percent, respectively.

“VVhile platinum-based che-
motherapy is often viewed as a
ﬁrst-line, therapy for patients
with advanced non—small cell
lung cancer, there is no estab-
lished treatment standard for this

<-population,” Belani said. “The
improved survival associated"

with the docetaxel/cisplatin com-

, bination "means that a superior

treatment may be available for

this vast group of patients who”

are not candidates for surgical

model to observe the natural

learning of pre—schoolers in their
everyday settings and to give
feedback to teachers and parents
so they can improve care. SPECS
conducts longitudinal evalua-
tions of child, family, program,
health, nutrition, early literacy,
community and school transi-
tion benchmarks in a broad ef-

' fort to upgrade quality and scope

of early care and education and
early school success locally and
across Pennsylvania.

SPECS follows’ children in-
volved in Pittsburgh’s Early
Childhood Initiative (ECI) into
third grade and works with prin-
cipals, teachers and parents to

, document each child’s’success in

acquiring developmental, pre-
academic, social and behavioral
competencies.

The new grant will enable
SPECS to continue researching
the comprehensive ECI pro-
grams in Braddock and
Wilkinsburg that currently are
operated by Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Child
Development. SPECS also will
continue to evaluate the early
care and education programs in
Sto—Rox, Homewood and East

New prostate
cancer drug
shows promise

Researchers at Pitt andjohns
H6’f)1Ei’ri§”'"rej3’or“t" ‘pr6ff1isiii’g‘*"“‘re-'
sults in tests of a new prostate
cancer drug knownas ABT—62 7,
made by Abbott Laboratories of
Abbott Park, III.

R In a phase II multi—national
clinical trial, the drug ' delayed
progression of advanced‘ pros-
tate cancer with few side effects
in men no longer responding to
hormone therapy.

_ Results of the study were an-
nounced at the American Soci-
ety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
annual meeting this week.

“For patients who have failed
hormone therapy, and whose
prostate cancer is progressing

parts of the body, the options for
treatment are limited right now,”
said Michael Carducci, assistant

professor of oncology at the-

Johns Hopkins Oncology Cen-

ter and director of the study.‘
“This low—toxicity drug may de- _ '

lay the need for'more aggressive,
but non-curative treatments like

' ‘chemotherapy or radiation in
. these patients.”

In one group of 244 patients
who received either oral ABT—
627 or a placebo, results show
that progression of disease was
delayed 69 days more in those on

' ABT-627 than in those on ‘pla-

cebo. Those taking the drug took
twice as long for their Prostate
Speciﬁc Antigen (PSA) level to
rise by more than 50 percent, an
indicator of disease progression.
Relatively few patients experi-
enced side effects.

Related studies of 419 pa-
tients, led byjoel Nelson, pro-
fessor and chair of urology at
Pitt’s School of Medicine, con-
clude that ABT—627 also stabi-
lizes spread of prostate cancer
(metastasis) to the bone. Often a

painful effect of late—stage pros-

tate cancer, bone metastasis sig-

niﬁes a poor prognosis in pros-
tate cancer patients. In the study, -
patients who got a placebo expe-
rienced increases in biochemical
markers indicating bone metasta-
sis, whereas levels of those mark-
ers remained stable in patients
receiving ABT-627.
'ABT-627 blocks endothelin,
a protein best known as a potent
blood‘ vessel constrictor. Pros-
tate cancer cells secrete excess
amounts of endothelin which
may act as a growth enhancer
and promote spread of cancer to
the bone. A
“Prostate cancer is a chronic
disease requiring chronic
therapy,” Nelson said. “An oral,
once-a-day medication, like the
one we studied, is ideal.”
Prostate cancer is diagnosed
in approximately 180,400 men
every year; close to 32,000 die
annually. Most prostate cancers

are found in the early stages of_

the disease and are highly cur-
able. Studies suggest that the
average life expectancy of men
with hormone-resistant, pro-
gressive and metastatic prostate
cancer is 12 months.

The study was supported by
Abbott Pharmaceuticals. Car.-
ducci and Nelson are paid con-
sultants to' Abbott. The terms of
this arrangement are being man-
aged by thejohns Hopkins Uni-
versity and Pitt’s School ofMedi-
cine in accordance with conﬂict
of interest’ policies.

Surgeons use
ZEUS robotic 4
system during
surgery

Pitt surgeons are among the
ﬁrst in the United States to use
the ZEUS Robotic Surgical Sys-
tem during endoscopic surgery
for people who have chronic gas-
troesophageal reflux disease
(GERD).

ZEUS enhances surgery us-
ing three robotic arms controlled
by the surgeon, who sits at a
nearby control console. As the
surgeon works the controls, -hand
movements are replicated by ro-

botic arms at theoperative site in
real time.

GERD is a disorder in which
stomach acids reﬂux or surge
upward, from the stomach into
the esophagus. The edoscopic
surgery, called Nissen fundopli—
cation, involves wrapping the
stomach around the esophagus

to create a new valve that pre- '

vents the acid from reﬂuxing into
the stomach. v

' Surgery was performed May
11 at UPMC Presbyterian on a
female as part of a multi-center

research study to evaluate the 4

safety and effectiveness of ZEUS
in minimally invasive anti-reﬂux
surgery. The research study also
will compare short-term out-
comes of patients who undergo
standard laparoscopic Nissen
fundoplication to those who un-

dergo ZEUS-assisted surgery.
The randomized study will

enroll 125 patients at ﬁve cen-
ters in the United States. About
25 patients will be enrolled in
the study at Pitt. Half of the
patients will undergo conven-
tional minimally invasive surgery
without ZEUS assist. V
“ZEUS represents one of the
ﬁrst applications of robotic tech-
nology to the operating room.
These early applications and tri-
als will allow surgeons to work
together with industry to con-

tinue to apply new robotic tech-

nology to enhance patient care,”
said James D. Luketich, sec-

tion head ofthoracic surgery,
co-director of the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute’s
Lung Cancer Center, co—direc-
tor of the Mark Ravitchl Leon C.
Hirsch Center for Minimally
Invasive Surgery and principal
investigator of the study.

In a ZEUS—assisted mini-
mally invasive Nissen fundopli—

cation surgery, the surgeon cre-

ates ﬁve small incisions, called
ports, in the upper abdomen.
One ports is used to insert an
endoscope that enables the sur-
geon to view the operating area.
Other surgical instruments are
held and moved by the ZEUS
system through the remaining
ports.

The surgeon views the op-
erative site on a high-resolution
monitor and operates handles
that resemble conventional ‘sur-
gical instruments. The surgeon’s
hand movements are scaled, and
hand tremor is ﬁltered by the
computer and translated via the
robotic arms into precise micro
movements at the operative site.
The surgeon controls the move-
ments of the endoscope through

the University community

Robotic-assisted surgery has
similar beneﬁts to other mini-
mally invasive procedures, in-
cluding small incisions, roughly
the diameter of a pencil, reduced
trauma, shorter hospital stays and
convalescent periods, improved
surgeon precision and dexterity,
improved visualization in 2-D
or 3-D ﬁelds and minimized sur-
geon fatigue with an ergonomic
operating environment. _
The study is sponsored by

Computer Motion, Inc., manu-

facturer of the ZEUS system.
In August 2000, surgeons at
Pitt unveiled a prototype of the
21st century operating room
which integrated Hermes, a ro-
botic speech recognition system,
and AESOP, a robotic endo-
scopic positioning system.
These systems give surgeons
greater control over the operat-
ing room‘ environment by ex-

tending their reach beyond the

sterile ﬁeld of the operating table,
adding an extra “hand” to assist
during surgery and making sur-
gery less fatiguing for the sur-
geon and operating room staff]

UPB starts environmental studies major

This fall the Bradford campus will launch a major in environ-
mental studies, which will offer students an interdisciplinary course
of study to prepare them for careers related to the environment.
Students in the major will take courses in a variety of academic
disciplines to ready them for careers in business, industry, educa-
tion, communications, politics, resource management, urban and
regional planning and public relations. ’

“The job possibilities are limitless,” said Assad Pariah, program
director and professor of geology and environmental science and
one of four Pitt-Bradford faculty members who helped develop the
new major. The new major is being developed by Panah; Mary
Puterbaugh, assistantprofessor of biology, Stephen Robar, assistant
professor of political science, and Tim Ziaukas, program director

and associate professor of public relations.

Pariah said students with an environmental studies degree will be
able to choose from jobs ranging from horticulturist, park ranger or
fund—ra1ser, to social scientist or public relations professional. I

Ballot initiatives: Wrong way
to create laws, columnist msists

ments are. It really tested people’s
fundamental views of themselves,
of their relationship to their Cre-
ator. Is it a question of individual
autonomy or beyond our capac-
ity to decide?”

The vote was decided 51-49

percent in favor of allowing phy- —

sician—assisted suicide.

“I don’t know of any legisla-
tive body, which knew that their
constituents were as evenly di-
vided on an issue that cut as
deeply as that issue, that would
not find a way of postponing that
decision until there was greater
agreement in the society.”

Thirdly, Broder said, the
rights and legal protections of
minorities are in danger. “Racial
minorities are at—risk. In Cali-
fornia a ballot initiative repealed
the California open—housing law.
VVhite Californians were not
ready for that law, and minori-
ties were.denied the protection
of their state’s open—housing
law.” ' ,'

Ethnic minorities also are

‘potentially at-risk, he said. “ Cali-
fornia passed an initiative out-
lawing bi-lingual education, even
though Latinos, who were most

‘ affected by that, were opposed

to it.” Furthermore, state-wide
ballot initiatives can pit geo-
graphic areas against one an-
other. “In Colorado, a legislator
in the rural areas told me he was
concerned that almost any envi-
ronmental initiative on the bal-
1.9:.pa§ses,.aut9rnati2al1y-Ziathe

'*Tgaa&ﬁﬁ *:n1'

 
  

compromises could be .reached
to make such measures more
palatable for his constituents or
be balanced with measures ben-
eﬁcial to them, Broder said. In

. short, bargaining disappears  ‘

ballot initiatives.

The cynicism of the'tradi—
tional legislative process that
ballot initiatives represent and
that is characterized by voter
apathy and the popularity of term
limits should not be ignored,
Broder stressed.

Reﬂectingonlastyear’spresi—
dential campaign, he said he
thoughtthere would have been
more turmoil in the aftermath of
the drawn-out election. “I
thought there would have been a
genuine crisis of credibility about
our election process, whether
people who want to vote are able
to vote and whether everybody’ 3
vote gets counted. I thought
there would be a lot of turmoil

, about that and about the way the

Supreme Court ended that pro-
cess. It seems the country has
gotten pastthat. Instead, what I
hear is that this election was
probably no more crooked, no
more contrived, no worse than
ever.” .-

But this cynicism “is a kind of
cancer eating away at the nation
and at a fundamental building
block of this blessed nation and
at the procedural process of law.
We should write laws when

needed, but also protect minori- —

ties and freedoms;
