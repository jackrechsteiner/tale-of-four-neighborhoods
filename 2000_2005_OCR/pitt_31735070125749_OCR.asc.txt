‘ CHARLOTTE TUCKER
Assistant News Editor

“President George V W. 0 Bush _

addressed the nation and a joint session

of.Co_ngr_ess last night, nine-days after , 1 1 if

the terrorist attacks * that leveled: the
World Trade _Center towers, ﬂattened

part of the Pentagon and left close to 0

7,000 people missing or dead.

During the 40-minute speech, Bush 0

praised rescue workers whoresponded
at the scenes and recognized-the family
members of several of those killed in’th_e
attacks. ' . ' . , .0

He thanked people around the world
for their “prayers in English, Hebrew-
and Arabic,” and said, “My fellow citi-
zens, for the last nine days, the entire

world has seenifor itself the state of our

union, and it is strong.” N
Bush also armounced the creation of
a new, cabinet-level position called the
Office of Homeland Security, to which
he appointed Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge; _ '
' Before the speech many speculated
on whether Bush would openly declare
war against Afghanistan and its ruling

' igovemment, the Taliban. Earlier this

week the government of Pakistan sent an
envoy to the Taliban, asking it to turn

. over Saudi exile Osarna bin Laden, who

is believed to be hiding in the wilderness

. of central Afghanistan. Bin ‘Laden is
 .wanted for his ' alleged involvement in

1' A ' Center,_ the bombings of the U.S.

: 1“r‘embas,sies in Kenya and Tanzania, the <

attack on the USS Cole last year and the

_. most recent attacks on the World Trade
_ Center and the Pentagon.

But Bush’s speech did not get into
speciﬁcs. « V v

Instead, the speech was a primer for
what Bush described as “a lengthy cam-
paign, unlike any other we have seen.”

He contrasted the American
response with previous battles, including
the quickly resolved Gulf War and the
air strikes above Kosovo during which
no Americans were killed, saying, “Our

' response involves far more than instant

retaliation and isolated strikes.”

Bush said Americans cannot expect
to live through this chapter of history
quickly and that rather than targeting

one group, he would attack terrorism‘

itself. . _
“It may include dramatic strikes,

“We will starve terrorists of ftmding, V.

While most students contemplate
their weekend activities or simply
relax, there are many other people
faced with more urgent and painful

issues.
~ One person is Thomas Riser IV,

an April 2001 Pitt graduate struck by
a car while crossing a Highland Park

0 - street after exiting a bus Aug. 21.

At the time of the accident, Riser,
22, from Wheeling, W.Va., worked at
Pitt’s School of Dental Medicine as a
member Of - the support staff. He
intended to begin graduate school at
Pitt this term with plans to study

French and eventually become a pro-

fessor. _
Since his accident, Riser has
needed 55 units of blood. Today Pitt
hosts a blood drive from 8 a.m. to 5
p.m. in the Masonic Temple at which
donors can specify that their blood be

=1_1sed to‘ help Riser.

" Riser was well known on ‘campus
through‘ his extensive work in the

~ Riser’s. “His spirit is wonderful even

through all of this.”

Since the accident, Riser has been
in critical condition and underwent
several operations. “He has been
through a lot  since then,” Sherry
Strum said, who is also a personal
friend of Riser’s.

Strum said Riser had open—heart
surgery, several orthopedic operations
and had his spleen removed; He’s also
had pins implanted in his legs.

He remains in critical condition
and was recently moved from the
intensive care unit to the acute care
unit of UPMC Presbyterian.

Anyone who wants to donate
blood to help Riser, or wishes to
donate blood in general should call
Gwen Watkins at 412-624-7702, for
an appointment. ’

Drilling will upset
wildlife, speaker says  

JAMES DEWEESE
Staff Writer

A way of life hangs in the bal-
ance, according to representatives
of the Alaskan Wilderness League
and the Gwich’in nation, as the
Senate prepares to vote on the fate
of an energy bill that may include
provisions for drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.

Ken Smith, a Gwich’in native
from the village of Ft. McPherson,
Northwest Territories, Canada,
addressed a group of approximately
70 Pitt students, faculty and com-
munity members, making an impas-
sioned plea for the survival of his
people.

“If you can’t live out on the
land, you really aren’t much of a
person,” he said. “We’re proud and
noble when we’re on the land.”

According to Lenny Kohn of the
Alaskan Wilderness League, the
Gwich’in — who are northern mem-
bers of a the group of Native
Americans more commonly known
as Athabaskans —- have relied on
the biological richness of the
coastal plains for the their lives and
livelihoods for over 30,000 years.

“My people are a seasonal peo-

.ple,” Smith said, and went on to

outline the Gwich’ins’ use of differ-
ent animal and plant food sources
over the course of the year. They
use muskrat in the spring,’ fish and
berries in the summer, moose and
trout in the fall and caribou in the
winter.

The Gwich’ins’ largest concern
right now is the fate of the caribou,
which provide food during the arctic
winter months and material for cer-
emonial dress.

The caribou are migratory ani-
mals and their calving grounds are
at the heart‘ of the proposed drilling
site in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, an area known as 1002.

Kohn said that the caribous’
annual cycles would be severely
disrupted in the event of develop-
ment in an area where they birth
their young. Furthermore, he char-
acterized the industry’s promise to
use only 2,000 of the more than 1.5
million acres in Arctic National

Wildlife refuge as unrealistic.
According to Kohn, the most
destructive part of the oil acquisi-

tion is not the continuous pumping, ~

but the exploratory process.
“Which 2,000 acres?”
asked. He said that the 2,000 acres
of development would not necessar-
ily be contiguous, and that adding to
that number the amount of land that
would be needed for roads, staff

facilities and production areas, con- ,

siderably more land would be used.

Kohn has been involved in the
movement to protect the wildlife
refuge since his first exposure 14
years ago.

“It was a proverbial ‘no—brain-
er,”’ he said. “The minute I set ‘foot
on the coastal plains, I realized that

I had put my foot in a place as 1
‘ important of the Grand Canyon.” ‘

The largest threat currently fac- ;
ing area 1002, according to the,
Kohn, is the situation in the after- 
math of Tuesday’s terrorist attack. 3
“[Proponents of drilling] have their 
list and depending on whatever is i
going wrong in the world, they use ;'

that,” he said.

Kohn refuted the argument that ;
oil found in the Arctic National
Refuge would bolster '»
national security, saying that any 
plant constructed would not be fully 

Wildlife

operational for at least 10 years.‘

Kohn encouraged the audience 
to get involved by writing and call- 
ing‘Sens. Arlen Specter and Rick 
Santorum. Ultimately, he believed ;
that the real opportunity lies with 
Specter, but he said the audience 
“should call Santorum and give him 
one more chance to get into he'.av—

Swanksville, Pa.

Kohn said he questioned the:
importance of what he and Smith 
were doing in the wake of the disas— ’
ter, but both decided that what was 

at stake was “too important.”

“It’s not a sport,” said Smith. 

“It’s a way of life.”

Clerics advise bin Laden to leave Afghanistan

» RAJIV CHANDRASEKARAN
The Washington Post

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
Afghanistan’s top Islamic clerics rec-
ommended Thursday that the nation’s
ruling Taliban militia persuade alleged

A terrorist Osama bin Laden to leave the

country. But the United States swiftly
rejected the move, repeating its
demand that the Taliban surrender bin
Laden or face possible military attack.

The clerics didn’t set a deadline
for bin Laden to depart, saying he
should be encouraged to leave “in the
proper time and of his own free will.”
But the decision nevertheless was the
first time Afghan leaders have dis-

. tanced themselves from bin Laden, ’a
, longtime guest of the Taliban who has

become the world’s most wanted man
for his alleged role in last week’s ter-
rorist attacks in New York and
Washington.

U.S. ofﬁcials, however, called the
clerics’ action insufﬁcient. ‘

“It does not meet America’s
requirements,” said White House

- spokesmanAri Fleischer. He said bin

Laden and other accused terrorists
working with him and based in
Afghanistan must be surrendered to

“responsible authorities.”

“We want action, not just state-
ments,” Secretary of State Colin
Powell said in Washington. “The soon-
er he leaves and is brought to justice,
the better off I think the world will
be.”

The clerics’ conveyed their recom-
mendation to the top Taliban leader,
Mohammad Omar, who will decide
whether to pass the message onto bin
Laden, a wealthy Saudi exile who has
been hiding out in Afghanistan since
1996. Omar previously has said he
would not extradite bin Laden. But at a
news conference Thursday in Kabul,
the Afghan capital, the Taliban’s edu-
cation minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi,
said Omar “will act on the basis of the
clerics’ guidance,” the Reuters news
agency reported. .

Late Thursday night; the Taliban
reiterated that it’ wouldn’t force bin
Laden to leave. In a statement issued
by its embassy in Islamabad, the
Taliban said that making him ﬂee
“would be an insult to Islam.” .

Muttaqi said the process of relo-
cating bin Laden “must happen slow-
ly.”

The clerics also said they would
formally call for a jihad, or a holy -war,
if ‘U.S. forces attack targets in
Afghanistan. “If a powerful I-country

new  :_ct;2.@  

attacks a’ weak country, it is a jihad for '

all Muslims,” the clerics said in a
statement reported  the Taliban’s
official Bakhtar news agency.

Dozens of U.S. warplanes were
dispatched to the Persian-Gulf area on
Wednesday, and two U.S. aircraft_car-
rier battle groups are operating in the
region, with a third en route.

Officials in two ' Central Asian
countries on Afghanistan’s northern
border, however, denied Thursday that
U.S. warplanes would be allowed to
strike Afghan targets from bases on
their territory. Defense Department
ofﬁcials had stated Wednesday that the
United States had been given permis-
sion to operate out of Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan, but those countries said no
agreements had been struck with
Washington.

Iran, another Afghan neighbor,
ruled out granting overﬂight‘ clearance
for U.S. planes. “We will never allow
American airplanes to use Iranian air-
space to attack Afghanistan,” Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Aseﬁ told Reuters.

Aseﬁ also said Iran would not let
bin Laden enter the country if he left
Afghanistan. '

reached at the end of a two-day meet-
ing of almost 1,000 senior religious
leader's, appeared to be a compromise
between hard—liners ready to go to war
to defend him and those who want to
prevent a‘ devastating American
assault.

“We wanted to ﬁnd a solution that

would save our country and solve the -

problem of our guest,” one cleric,
Mohammed Naseer, . told the
Associated Press.

Pakistan’s foreign minister, Abdus
Sattar, whose government tried this
week" to persuade the Taliban to sur-
render bin Laden, said that “given
Afghanistan’s cultural traditions, ask-
ing a guest to leave is a very signiﬁ-
cant step, but not a giant one.” Sattar
urged, however, that the decision “be
given due weight.”

But diplomats and analysts who
monitor the Taliban called the clerics’
request implausible. It’s difﬁcult to
imagine, they said, any nation agreeing
to accept bin Laden, a movethat would
almost certainly result in political and
economic isolation.

“He can’t go anywhere,” said
Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani jour-
nalist and political analyst. “He will be

Study finds depression hereditary-

RYAN MCLIMANS
The Pitt News

' A new study from Pitt’s School
of Medicine found that nearly half
of all people who develop recurring
depression before the age of 25 have

. a family member who also suffers

from one ormore mood disorders.
According to Dr. George S.
Zubenko, parents, siblings and chil-
dren of individuals with recurring
early-onset major depression, or
RE—MDD, are eight times more like-
ly to develop a mood disorder than
the rest of the general population.

,7 “Clinical depression and related
disorders constitute major health
problems that warrant early detec_-
tion and_ appropriate treatment,”
said Zubenko, a professor of psychi-

‘L atry and director of the molecular

neurobiology and genetics laborato-
ry. = . '
“This form of depression runs
strongly in families, is associated
with other mental disorders that
include prominent‘ disturbances of

' mood, and has a significant negative

impact on the health and longevity
of patients and their family mem-
bers.” '

Major depression affects seven-

percent of all adults, approximately
17 million people. Alcoholism and
drug abuse, anxiety disorders and
personality disorders commonly
accompany RE-MDD.

What is recurring early-onset
major depression? '

Recurring means the patient has
had at least two episodes of major
depression. Early-onset means the
first depressive episode, whether it
was diagnosed or treated at the time,
occurred before the age of 30.

Starting in January 2000,
researchers evaluated 1,300" mem-
bers of 81 families that included rel-
atives recognized as ‘having RE-
MDD. . ‘ '.

They’ found that within these
high-risk families, individuals live
on average eight years fewer than

the population at large and more

than 40 percent die before age 65.
These families also have a much
higher infant mortality rate and" are
more susceptible to neurodegenera-
tive diseases such as Alzheimer’s. A
According to Zubenko, the time
between a person’s conception and

birth plays a critical role in deter-'

mining normal brain activity. An
individual’s brain forms neurons
and develops their interconnections

J

during this time. «

“Inborn or prenatal errors that
alter this process may contribute to
the later development of psychiatric
disorders,” Zubenko said.

This study and further research
will help physicians and health care
providers screen patients suffering
from RE—MDD for suicide risk,
alcoholism and drug abuse. Most of
the screening relies on family inter-
views, but family members may
underreport symptoms of major
depression. With the identification
of the gene pairs that specifically
inﬂuence the risk of major depres-
sion will come new and more effec-
tive treatments. '

The school of medicine» is con-

ducting a 'four—year study to collect

and sample gene linkages to help

V clarify their research and locate the

specific biological cause of major
depression in these high-risk fami-
lies. ’

“In a foreseeable future, results
from our ongoing studies that rely
on a unique library of transformed
cell lines representing these fami-
lies may also provide new opportu-
nities for treating or even prevent-
ing these disorders,” Dr. Zubenko
said. ‘

ultimatum to

Taliban

Bush, page 1,

tect the terrorists: but he spoke directly
to the Taliban, demanding the delivery
of leaders of al—Qaeda to U.S. authori-
ties, the protection of foreigners in
Afghanistan, the closing of terrorist
training camps and full United States
access to the camps so that “we can
make sure they are no longer operating ”

“Our war on terror begins with al-
Qaeda,” he said, “but it does not end
there. It will not end until every terrorist
group of global reach has been found,
stopped and defeated.”

Bush ended his speech on a patriot-
ic note, holding up the badge of a police
officer killed at the World Trade Center.

“This is my reminder of lives that
ended and a task that does not end,” he
said. “The course of this conﬂict is not
known, yet its outcome is certain.
Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty,
have always been at war, and we know
that God is not neutral between them. In
all that lies before us, may God grant us
Wisdom, and may he watch over the
United States of America.”

These two weeks have been rough.
The normal stresses of day-to-day life have
combined with a great feeling of sympathy
for the victims and uncertainty as the coun-
try looks down a long road to war.

_ Chances are you’re just working for .
the weekend —— and you might even feel a
bit guilty about it.

Have no worries. This weekend is
shaping up to offer you a healthy dose of
fun while providing plenty of opportunities
to show your national spirit and volun-

Start the weekend by volunteering at
the blood drive being held in the Masonic

In the wake of national tragedy, remember
that area patients need blood too. At the
drive, you can specify your blood be given
to Pitt grad Thomas Riser, who has
required 55 units since being hit by a car in

late August. , '

Can’t give blood? Don’t forget you
can always help others give by escorting
and providing refreshments to donors.

Recoup from the blood drive in front
of the old tube. Check out the national
telethon “America: A Tribute to Heroes”
on most major networks from 9 to 11 p.m.

The collective reaction to the
recent terrorist attacks appears to be
the belief that a foreign organiza-

occurred to us that there might even
be a non-cultural reason for us to be
hated.

Self-absorbed volunteerism cheapens deeds

Since the attacks last week, I’ve
noticed something that’s making the
cynic in me laugh sardonically while
she drinks her black coffee — the relief
effort seems to have been taken over by
the self-absorbed.

Everywhere I go, ‘people who nor-
mally rave “me, me, me” all the way

anything they can do for you. All you
want is for them to go away. You don’t
know why, and maybe you.feel guilty
because they’re just trying to make you
feel better. '

But they’re not. They are putting on

4 a display for the world, a display of how

wonderful, kind and caring they are for

home are doing just the
same, only now it verges on
important. “What I did for
the disaster relief,” “How it’s
affecting me” and “Why I
think we should bomb those
suckers.”

I couldn’t quite pinpoint
why it was bothering me that
these people seemed gen-
uinely concerned about

    

Heather Bowlan
Columnist

helping you out. —
. , Don’t be ,fooled by
them and don’t feel guilty
that you aren’t donating all
of your clothes, blood and
time to, disaster relief.
Maybe you haven’t
seen the planes crash into
the twin towers from every
conceivable angle. Maybe
the most you’ve done is
donate a few dollars at the

something. And then I real-
ized it — they aren’t. This is
just a new tactic to keep their favorite
topic (themselves) on the agenda,
which, obviously, cheapens their
actions considerably. I

I’m sure you know people like this.
Normally, they wouldn’t ask how you
were doing if you were visibly choking,
and now here they are, so concerned
about other people’s lives. When you
ask them what they’re doing for the
weekend, they self-righteously inform
you that in between watching CNN and
CNBC for the latest coverage, they will
be Downtown helping out at the Red
Cross for a-few hours and then spending
their life’s savings on a plane ticket to
New York to attend a vigil.

It’s a nightmare situation we’re all
familiar with: You’re having a bad day,

‘and it shows. Suddenly you’re sur-

rounded by people you barely know,
asking you if you’re okay, if there’s

Giant Eagle checkout
counter. That doesn’t mean that you
haven’t been affected by what’s hap-
pened and that you don’t" want to help.

This is important to realize. At ﬁrst
I wondered what was wrong with me
when I wanted to stop watching the
news altogether and when I didn’t jump
to hang an American ﬂag out the win-
dow. I wondered how my apathetic sec-
ond skin had really grown so thick.

That is, until I received an email
about a “Gathering for Peace” that will
be held this Saturday outside‘ Carnegie
Mellon University’s Software
Engineering Institute at 4 p.m. The
institute would be instrumental if we go
ahead with a missile defense system.»

When I heard about this event, I
surprised myself with how much it
means to me to attend. This is how I
want to commemorate the victims of
last Tuesday’s events + by trying to

ILLUSTRATION BY J ACKEE STECK/EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATOR

prevent something like it ﬁom ever
happening again. _

Missile defense will not solve the
problems behind those attacks. We need
to stop treating other ethnicities like
second-class citizens and- start thinking
globally about how we live.

As Michael Moore said in his
recent-essay “Death, Downtown” about
the terrorist attacks, “Will we ever get
to the point that we realize we will be
more secure when the rest of the world
isn’t living in poverty so we can have
nice running shoes?”

Nonetheless, whether you support
war or peace is beside the point. We all
need to stand and act in a way that rep-
resents how we feel. As many editorials
have told us, we are in a way all vic-

Ntims. But if we refuse to be passive, to

let others decide for us what is to_be
done, we are no longer victims. We are
survivors.

So the next time you run into one of
these people wearing red, white and

' blue for the ﬁfth straight day, and he or

she tells you, “I can’t talk long. I have
to go paint a commemorative mural

before I donate blood again,” just smile

and say you understand.

They’ve got something to prove to
the world, and that’s ﬁne. But really,
we’ve got» nothing to prove here. We
just have to deal with what’s happened
any way we can and try to heal.

Columnist Heather Bowlan invites all
self-absorbed people to share their very
important opinions with her at
heb6@pitt. edu.

Two weeks later, American arrogance still abounds

Chung, page 6

ﬂags and chanting, “U-S—A, U-S-
A,” is that if such an event occurred
in Tokyo or Dublin, we wouldn’t be
so sad — because that wouldn’t be
an “Attack on America.”

That sucks. ‘

Just to brieﬂy demonstrate our
arrogance, look at the concern’ about
the HIV epidemic in America.
Realize that the U.S. and other
industrialized nations account for
less than 4% of all AIDS-related
deaths. Developing nations bear a
whopping 95 percent of all
HIV/AIDS casualties, with 86 per-
cent in sub-Saharan Africa alone.

As another example, a weekly
paycheck of $400 -— easy to
achieve in America, and close to
what the average college grad

makes when entering the workforce
— might be used for, say, a leather
option on a new car, two dates at the
symphony or digital cable for a
year. . .
But in developing nations, this
figure amounts to the cost of subsis-
tencelfor about 155 days. ,

Now back to the rise - in
American nationalism. Sure, we’ve
earned it. But am I the only one who
feels like the surge in nationalism is
implicitly contributing to racism?
Hell, it’s contributing explicitly to
an extreme form of racism: hate
crimes.

By Wednesday, more than 200
Sikhs, mistaken by their turbans and
beards for affiliates of the terrorists,
had reported hate crimes. Saturday,

.a Pakistani-American Muslim was

shot and killed at- his store in

Dallas. An Egyptian-American
Christian in San Gabriel, Calif., was
also killed at his market. A
Lebaneseisstore clerk and.a Sikh gas
station owner were shot and killed
by a man. who exclaimed, “I’m a
patriot. I-’ m a damn American all the
way.”

But racist behavior and senti-
ment can appear in disguise.
Americans as young as 20 can
remember the Cold War Era, where
jokes today such as, “Kill him, he’s
communistl” -were no joke.

Only fifty years ago, the institu-
tion of segregation in America
extended beyond bathrooms and
busses to basic democratic rights
such as voting. And don’t you think
desegregation at the time was seen
as un-American? What do you think
Bush or Robertson would have said

in that era? You better believe they
would have decried it as ,un-
Christian as. interracial marriage
and equal rights for gays. '

-I’m incredibly proud to be an"

American. We’ve made amazing

social progress in the last century.

We are champions of freedom and
equality. But the economic“prosper—
ity capitalism allows comes with_the
price of economic oppression in the
formof incredibly disparate distrib-
ution of wealth.

Social injustice can exist -in
forms more subtle than hate crimes.

A dream of mine i_s slowly
coming true. »
In one of my favorite child-
hood books, “From the Mixed-Up

 

Files of Mrs. Basil E.
Frankweiler,” the main character,
Claudia, runs away to The

    

Metropolitan Museum of Art. She ' 1"‘

violin lesson, her violin case hold-
ing instead her clothes and other
things she needs. '

Through a glitch in her escape
plan, she can’t ditch her younger .
brother, and he accompanies her to the museum. The two
hide out there, ‘eventually solving a mystery about one of
the museum’s sculptures. '

I always envied the girl who got to run away and hide
in the museum. When I walk through the Carnegie
Museum’s cool corridors, my footsteps echoing in the
marble hallways, I sometimes wonder vvhat it would’ be
like to hide from the blue-jacketed security guards. I
could slip away into a darkened room, or crouch behind a
stone casting in the Hall of Architecture, emerging only
after the halls are dark and _I am the only one still there.

At night, the Carnegie is tantalizingly lit; this section
of Oakland is amazingly peaceful, a place of solitude,
perfect for evening contemplation. Behind the museum,
the glass courtyard is lit by the warm glow of lights ema-
nating from a rushing golden waterfall. Sometimes I see
a guard walking by in the sparsely lit museum, and I won-
der what it would be like to be in there. .

I have also always thought that the museum is ideal
for romance. It would be wonderful to meet someone in
the majestic hall of architecture for a secret rendezvous,
or to simply wander through halls of greatness with
someone you care about. The idea of being near ancient
works of art that carry their own magniﬁcent histories is
romantic, too. And while the museum is still nice during
the day, there’s something mysterious and alluring about
being there in the evening. _

This summer, the Carnegie remained open until 9 ‘

ed patiently until my schedule allowed me to attend the it
exhibit in the evening, which featured works by Vanni
Gogh, Monet and other impressive artists. I was excited
that the museum was open for another four hours, at least
one day a week, but I was disappointed these special
hours would disappear with the special exhibit.

I recently discovered this is no longer true. After
spotting an advertisement for Thursday’s extended hours,
I called the museum to confirm this fact. It is true: the
museum is now open until 9 p.m. every Thursday night.

Apparently, the museum is trying these new hours
until the end of the year. Will they work? I hope they do.
In fact, I hope the museum stays open later on other days
of the week, too. Not only is it a beautiful place to visit
at night, but it will only add to the cultural attractions
available in the city during the evening. A

And at least now I’ll have more time to find a hiding
place.

The B-3s are the epitome of a cool local
band. Far from the narcissistic despair and
cynicism found so readily on rock music
radio stations, the B-3s genuinely seem to be
having fun on their upcoming CD Krakatoa.
Their energy and enthusiasm is extreme, the
tracks sounding at times like they could be
raw, live recordings.

Of course, with raw and energetic live
sounds come inevitable ﬂaws. One of the
only drawbacks of Krakatoa is that at times
the B-3s sacriﬁce musicality for energy.
Although this occurs only a handful of times
throughout the album, there are nevertheless
moments when the band sounds slightly out
of sync. But they overcome what is likely
nothing more than sloppy editing and pro-
ducing with their unpretentious tone and
catchy songs, ensuring that their ﬂawed

moments merely further their image as a lov-
able jam band.

It is extraordinarily diﬂicult to label the
B-3s as playing any one style of music.
Drawing ﬁom styles including, but not
exclusive to, ska, soul, punk and blues, each
song diﬁers stylistically from the next Even
though some of the horn riﬁs become repet-
itive by the end of the album, the styles lay-
eredoverthehomsaresovariedthatthisis
easily forgiven.

Although the band sounds vaguely like

the upbeat Chicago blues of Save Ferris, No
Doubt, The Specials and The Commitments,
the B-35 have a sound completely their own.
And they take risks, performing a ska ver-
sion of “Hard Times,” written by Stephen
Foster, and “Foggy Dew,” a traditional
Celtic—sounding time featuring a tin whistle
and a’ driving drum beat. But their most
entertaining and original track is
“Montequilla (del Diablo Blanco),” an
immensely enjoyable, sleazy, vaguely
demonic song with a Latin inﬂuence.

Four different singers take turns as lead
vocalist, furthering the eclectic nature of the
album. And the different styles of singing are
as diverse as the tunes — raw and half-
crazed on “Montequilla” and weary and
plaintive on “Wake Me.”

This is an eminently likable, unassum-
ing band in a period of music when there are
woefully few empathetic rock stars. The few
ﬂaws of Krakatoa are easily and earnestly
forgiven because of the infectious energy
The B-3s exude.

, fact that there are regulars at FNI, that they

themselves are regulars, or that there’s
even any hierarchy to the group, but they
and several others sit farther back on the
stage, participate the most, and clearly
focus the irnprov’s direction.

“Freeze” lasts the longest of all the
games, and at its end comes the showcase.

Griswold hosts the showcase, and is
responsible for ﬁnding its talent. Tonight
the musical act has not shown up, so he
resorts to interviewing a randomly chosen
audience member, who introduces herself
as Reesa. I I

The audience learns that Reesa is from
Carnegie, dances with three different
dance groups and would like to someday
visit California.

Griswold’s interviewing partner,
Tom Forrest, who also appears to be an
FNI regular, asks Reesa her favorite color
and if she has ever seen “The Nutcracker.”

Griswold later reveals that the
showcase for the night had not gone as he
had plarmed. ‘

“It’s very rare I do anything like that,”
hesays of interviewing a random audience
member. “One thing is, I wanted to pick
the person myself.”

But otherwise Griswold, a ﬁﬁzh-year senior
at Pitt, is very pleased with how the night
has gone.

He likes to see new people get on

stage. “Everyone of these scenes you can
break down into a moment. You get to wit-
ness somebody’s inspiration, their cre-
ation,” Griswold says.

FNI takes place every Friday night,
even through the summer. During the
school year, the audience seldom drops
below 100.

The money collected from FNI goes
to pay for renting the studio, and also to
charity. FNI donates the proceeds from the
show the Friday before Thanksgiving to
KDKA’s turkey fund. I

Perhaps this fund is apropos; the situ-
ations FNI participants ﬁnd themselves in
can sometimes cause them to appear to be
turkeys. .

In fact, before choosing the volunteers
for “Genre Jump,” Mayer warns the audi-
ence, ‘,‘You have to understand that Lou
(Diamond, another of the regulars) and I
are going to f— with you. This game is
not easy.” For example, before Hawkins
and Werber finish jumping genres, they
will have become two cheerleaders trying
to smuggle drugs into Canada in the gen-
res of MTV Total Request Live in Spanish,
Amish ‘Carmonball Run,’ amphibian porn,
and “Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks
present ‘Teletubbies.”’

As Hawkins waddles on her knees,
convulsing and babbling in Teletubby-
speak, Werber takes -her hand and the two
“cross the Canadian border,” ﬁnally com-
pleting their task, to the delight and uproar

“Apocalypse Now Redux”
Directed by Francis Ford C
Coppola

, isihfrrﬁrl/2

Indisputably, “Apocalypse Now”
should be seen on the big screen. Director
Francis Ford Coppola’s decision to re-
release his hallucinatory Vietnam master-
piece over 20 years after its initial run is to
the beneﬁt of audiences who’ve never expe-
rienced it in a theater. The catch is that now
you’ll have to see his “redux” of the ﬁlm,
with an interesting but urmecessary 44 addi-
tional minutes of footage.

From his helicopter assault set to strains
of Wagner to his ﬁnal showdown with
Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), Captain
Wﬂ1ard’s  Sheen) slow, allegorical

 

Vietnam and into Cambodia are great
scenes in cinematic historyffhe production
was one that nearly cost the cast and crew
their sanity, especially Coppola. Coming off
of a string of powerful ﬁlms throughout the
1970s (“The Godfather I and II,” and “The
Conversation”), “Apocalypse Now” took
Coppola nearly three years to complete. But
the ﬁnal product resulted in arguably the
deﬁnitive movie about the Vietnam War.
Coppola hasn’t made a truly great ﬁlm
since.
Coppola doesn’t consider this the ﬁnal-
ized version of his ﬁlm, as the extra scenes,
particularly one set on a French plantation,
would be better included in the “deleted
scenes” section of a future DVD release.
But make no mistake‘—-this is one ﬁlmthat

Sevendust and others
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Pavilion
Sept. 22, 11:30 a.m.

Combine the unique musical ele-
ments of Lollapalooza and the diversiﬁed
extreme action of the X—Garnes and you
get “Resurgence: A day of bands, boards
and bikes.” - r

The radio station WXDX sponsors
the festival at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pavilion this Saturday at 11:30 a.m., fea-
turing headliners Sevendust, Saliva and
Saves the Day. This action—packed show is
also slated to feature former world chain-
pion BMX rider Jeff Lenosky and his
Schwinn demo team, a gravity-defying

“Balls of Steel” motorcycle stunt show ’

Listen

and numerous appearances
of various extreme acts
throughout the day.

Sevendust, the five
piece heavy-hitting outﬁt
from Atlanta, Ga., is set to close the show
at 10 p.m. with a grand ﬁnale perfor-
mance-. Riding high from an overwhelm-
ing positive response to their sophomore
release Home and the mega-hit single
“Angel’s Son,” featured on the album
Strait Up, a tribute to the late Lynn Strait
of Snot; the band is notorious for a live
show that leaves most of their contempo-
raries -in the dust.

The band, known for playing more
than 200 shows a year, is one of the most
hardened groups of road warriors in the
music world today. Few bands can imitate
Sevendust’s live experience, which is
reﬂected by the amazing crowd response
they receive from each and every venue
they play. Whether you are a fan of heavy
music or not, you will find your head
bouncing and jaw dropping, as the band
redeﬁnes the standard for a great live per-
formance every time they hit the stage.

What makes Sevendust stand out in a
music genre that has become ﬂooded with
one hit wonders and copycat acts? Apart
from their unparalleled road experience,
the group blends an incredible sound of
duel low—end guitars and bass, mixed with
the particularly innovative drum structures
set forth by one of new metal’s most
prominent drummers,
Morgan Rose. Compliment
this great music with a lead
singer who has an incredible
vocal range, supported by

_the unique presence of three back-up

vocalists, and’ you’re ready to be blown
away.

This show is must for any Sevendust
fan, as the group will more than likely
give their listeners a sneak peek at some of
the new songs to be featured on their Nov.
13 release of their highly anticipated third
album Animosity.

“This festival is a really good thing
because it shows there’s a lot of talent
that people don’t know about,” Sahr
Dummy said. “It represents our campus
as a whole because the music styles of
the three acts are so diverse.”

The three acts are indeed diverse, but
that isn’t to say that the members of
Mind Boxing Alliance share the same
sound. Sahr Dummy’s sound is self-
described as “switching from hype and
underground, but can be mellow at
times.” Dan Dabber boasts a smooth sto-
rytelling ﬂow on his tracks, while B—bon-
ics brings unique spinning skills, sain-
pling everything from contemporary hip-
hop to old school jazz beats.

As Mind Boxing Alliance performs,
break dancers may also impress the
crowd with their smooth moves.

The festival starts at noon with the
music portion beginning with the band
Sideview at 4 p.m., then Mind Boxing
Alliance at 5 p.m. and the headlining act,
SR-71 starting at 6:30 p.m. All of the fes-
tivities are free of charge to Pitt students.

Wesley Willis can really whip a
horse’s ass.

With a belt.

To Russia. ,

Yes, it’s the one of two times a year
that rock legend Wesley Willis comes to
Pittsburgh. Willis, a 350—pound, 34-
year—old chronically schizophrenic
black man from the streets of Chicago,
has written more than 400 songs about
friends, enemies, bands, mullets, super-
heroes, hellrides and animal genitalia
— each recorded over any one the
demo music samples programmed into
his keyboard synthesizer.

He is a sponge with a knack for
soaking in commercial catchphrases
such as “Wheaties: breakfast of cham-
pions” and “Diet Pepsi: uh-huh.” He
also picks up strange, non-sequitur
prepositional phrases like “You are my
friend as the world tums/You are my

_ friend in the Holy Ghost/I like you like

a backseat driver.” In fact, Willis deﬁ-
nitely has a sense of humor about it all.
Last time he was in town, he had just

picked up on “That’s My Bush,” repeat-
ing it ad nauseum between songs. He
also poked fun at himself with deadpan
versions of “Cut the mullet” and “I
whupped Batman’s ass.”

Should we take him seriously?
Willis’s songs are a simple, unironic
reﬂection of modern music and media.
His method is to repeat the expressions
he is most exposed to, hence his exten-
sive references to commercials and
advertisements. His ridiculous use of
vulgar language comes from the same
page, as we’re all often exposed to
common use of obscenities. Perhaps
there is some validity to his “joyride
music.” — A

Go see him. He’ll make the crowd
roar like a lion. He’s larger than life, a
prophet. He is Wesley Willis.

No fly zone over Michigan stadium
FAA to keep skies clear

ARUN GOPAL AND J ACQUELYN NIXON
Michigan Daily

At the request Of the University
of Michigan athletic department,
the Federal Aviation Administration
will restrict airspace around
Michigan Stadium - during
Saturday’s football game against
Western Michigan.

“The airspace Over the stadium

. is the sole responsibility and
authority of the FAA, which is a

. part of the federal Department of

Transportation,” athletic director
Bill Martin said.

Martin said he hopes to elimi-_

nate all aircraft, including planes
towing banner’ advertisements, dur-
ing future games.

“I think we all realize in light of
the events of this past week that
they do represent a potential haz-
ard, a safety concern,” he said.

The restriction only applies to
Saturday’s game between 10 a.m.

and 5 p.m., but athletic department-

officials have been trying to restrict

all aircraft Over the“ stadium for
some time.‘The game starts at 12:10
p.m. ‘

“I’ve received a lot of e—mails
from our fans asking us to re-ener-
gize our efforts to do that, and
we’re‘ working at the federal, the
state and the local levels,’’ Martin
said. “I do want to eliminate air-
planes flying over Michigan
Stadium. 
about banner airplanes but all air-
planes.”

Sen. Bill Bullard (R-Highland),

a season ticket-holder at Michigan

Stadium, said the FAA decision is
long overdue.

“I’ve been a football season
ticket holder for 40 years now 
and I’ve always felt there was a
chance of an accident,” he said.
“Now that we’ve got terrorist and
suicide bombers, I feel it’s more
urgent.” ,

, Several Ann Arbor area mer-
chants who advertise in the skies
during football games will be
affected by the restriction.

also key starters for Paul Pasqualoni’s team.

Look for Auburn to keep the ball on the
ground. Two weeks ago they gave the ball
to running backs Casinious Moore and
Ronnie Brown for a combined 153 yards on
41 attempts in their 27-21 win over
Mississippi. ’

The Orangemen were scheduled to
play East Carolina last Saturday and will
make up that game Saturday, Sept. 29.

Navy (30-2) at Boston College (1-0 Big
East, 1-1’Overall) '

The Boston College Eagles square off _

with Navy. The Eagles’ last action was in a
38-22 loss to Stanford.

Key players for the Eagles are Naval
Academy transfer wide receiver Ryan Read
who leads BC_ in receiving with six catches
and 72 yards, and the Big East’s leading
rusher, running back William Green, who
has rushed for 307 yards on 53 attempts this
season. ‘

Navy gave up 270 yards on the ground
in their last game, a 70-7 loss to Georgia
Tech. a »

Temple (1-1) at Bowling Green (2-0)
Temple plays at Bowling Green, whom

they beat last season 31-14. The~Owls’ last

‘game resulted in a 33-7 loss to Toledo.
Quarterback Mike McGar1n gets the

‘ nod this week, startingin place of senior

Devin Scott. This will be the ﬁeshmen quar-
terback’s first start of his career.

Other contributors include running
back Jason McKie who has rushed for 124
yards on 12 attempts and has one touch-
down, linebacker Taylor Suman who leads
the team ,in tackles with 12 and safety
Lafton Thompson who leads the team in
interceptions. .

Temple was held to minus 27 rushing
yards last game and Bowling Green held
Buffalo to 43 yards on the ground. Bowling
Green also controlled the ball keeping it for
36:51. Temple was ‘not able to control pos-
session in their last outing.

The Owls have not ﬁnalized plans to 5

make up their game from last week against
Connecticut.

~ Kent State (1-1) at West Virginia (0-1 Big

East, 1-1 Overall) -

- West Virginia hosts Kent State follow-

ing a 20-3 win over Ohio University.

Because of an injury to quarterback
Rasheed Marshall, Derek Jones will move
from wide receiver to quarterback, but Brad
Lewis will still start. Avon Coboume is
another key contributor at running back
with 235 yards rushing on the season.

, Kent State head coach Dean Pees says
he looks.to go out of a no huddle and spread
the offense.

West Virginia has rescheduled their
game against the University of Maryland ,
for Saturday, September 29. -

Baseball plays its part in

delivering relief to nation

Column, page 15 .

behind the Cardinals are the Cubs, Dodgers
and Giants ﬁghting it out with just about 15
games remaining. -

The Giants aren’t going for the wild
card primarily, as the team is only two
games behind the Diamondbacks. The
funny thing is, with all of the positivity
being spread around, not even a national
crisis could twist people to pull for Barry
Bonds to break Mark McGuire’s home run
record. I guess no matter how much people
want to enjoy themselves, they still can’t
force out a nice response for a proven jerk.

Unfortunately here in Pittsburgh, not
much is happening. The Pirates make error

after error, reminding spectators of the

Cleveland Indians in “Major League.” But
if you’re a baseball fan in the ‘burgh,
there’s still plenty to take your attention
away ﬁom the woeful Bucs.

. Roger-Clemens became the ﬁrst pitch-

er ever to put up a 20-1 record. Who smells
a sixth Cy Young? The Mariners have a
chance to claim the greatest single season
record ofjall time and the excitement of
going into the playoffs is escalating quick-
ly. «
'It’s such a mental relief to watch Peter
Garnrnons dissect a- game, rather than
observing a Fox News anchor ~-exploit
human suffering. One of the many lessons
that can be taught by this tragedy is that one
must take advantage of all opportunities
that are presented, enjoy life and have as
much fun as possible.

The Dalai Lama says that happiness is
the key to life, and over the past week base-
ball has been an important factor -in bring- V
ing happiness to thousands, lifting a
nation’s spirits.

UCLA moves forward, prepares for Ohio State

Moving forward, page 18

to maintain focus by game time
Saturday at his weekly press con-
ference Tuesday.

“I think it will be kind of emo-
tional, particularly early,” Toledo
said. “You take that field and some-
one sings the national anthem. It
will be a touchy thing.”

But he said once 12:30 p.m.
rolls around, his team will be ready.

“I think football brings out
aggressive people and eventually
when you kick it off, I think you

.will see some_ good football,” he

said.

At the crux of the Bruins’ game
plan will be senior running back
DeShaun Foster. In two games this
year, Foster ran for 289.yards on 52
carries and one touchdown. As a
sophomore against the Buckeyes in
1999, Foster ran for 51 yards on 17
carries and had one touchdown.

The Buckeyes won that game
42-20. Toledo said revenge is not on
the mind of, the Bruins.

“we had 11 freshmen and
sophomores that started in that
game. This is«a different football
team,” he said. “As far as motiva-
tion, I think Ohio State coming to
the Rose Bowl is motivation
enoughf’

He also had nothing but praise

‘ for the Buckeyes and their program.

“They are big, strong, tough,
physical and athletic,’ Toledo said.
“They are an outstanding football
team and they have a rich heritage
as far as tradition is concerned.”

For Saturday’s‘ game, UCLA
selected senior fullback Matt
Stanley as its captain. Stanley hails
from Columbus and we'nt,to Bexley
High School. In the 1999 OSU
game, he caught a deﬂected pass
and raced 67 yards for a touchdown.

, 4005. Craig St, Oakland.
Mon-Sun. 1 lam - 9:45pm -

That touchdown is the lone score in

Stanley’s career.

UCLA is 2-0 and last played
Sept. 8 at Kansas. After falling
behind 3-0, the Bruins scored the
next 27 points and rolled to a 41-17
victory.

Sept. 1, the Bruins opened their
season against Alabama. The Bruins
fell behind early against the Tide,
but stormed back for 20 unanswered
points and then held off a late rally
to prevail 20-17. .

Sophomore ﬂanker Tab Perry is

the Bruins leading receiver thus far

 
  
 

this year. He has six catches for 162
yards, including the game winning

touchdown reception against
Alabama.
Saturday’s game is UCLA’s

' home opener.

“It will definitely be another
difficult test for our football team.
The nice thing about it is that it is
our home opener,” Toledo said. “I

think there will be a great crowd ‘

and there will be a national televi-
sion audience. A lot of eyes will be
on this game.”

ning, Toledo admitted it is difficult,
but not impossible to concentrate
on football.

“They (his players) will never
forget what happened. Nobody will.
But they do realize that if you are
going to play, let’s go play then.
Otherwise, let’s not play at all,” he
said. “You can’t have any fear. You
have to move on.”

Against Big Ten teams Toledo is
1-4 in his six years at UCLA.
UCLA last played a Big Ten team
last December in the Sun Bowl.
They lost to Wisconsin, 21-20.

Ever wanted to be asquare?  

You thought it was a bad thing to be square. Here's your chance to change
your mind. Hollywood Squares and the Pitt Program Council are hosting a  
college student contestant search on Monday, September 24. Bring yourPitt
student ID to one of two 75-person tryouts (comprised of people chosen in a L
random drawing) in the WPU Lower Lounge, the first at 1pm and the second
at 4pm. Those who pass will move on to a mock game. Those who make

the out will then be eligible to participate in the Hollywood Squares college
game. Just goes to show that sometimes even squares can be cool.
