They crowded into the auditorium,
packing together, stumbling through the
darkness, their arms outstretched in search of
human ﬂesh. _ ' "

They’re not zombies, they’re Pitt stu-
dents, and the human they are searching for
is George Romero — writer, director and
creator of “The Night of the living Dead.”

Romero debuted his latest movie,
“Bruiser,” on Friday night in Alumni Hall,
fonnerly known as the Masonic Temple.
Romero said that he grew up watching B-
grade honor ﬁlms like “The Mu_rnrny” and
“Dracula”

‘‘I loved movies all my life and I
thought you had to be born‘ into some kind of

royalty to make them,” Romero said. T

 Tratherfthan the serious 'stuff,’’'

“Bruiser,” which was ﬁnished in the
spring of 2000 and was shown at the Cannes
F1lrnFestival, is the story of an emotionally
abused man who wakes up one day to ﬁnd
that he has no face. According to Romero,

the movie is about disenfranchisement in

society. Romero said he wrote the screen-
play after the shootings at Columbine High

9 School in 1999.

“I think probably when «we were cave
people we were sitting around telling horror
stories that had some meaning,” Romero
said “But generally, people just want to ride
the roller coaster.”

Romero’s ﬁlms have gathered a cult fol-
lowing through the years, especially on the
Internet. Type his name into any search
engine and a plethora of Web sites dedicated
to his movies pop up. According to Romero,
cult status carries a stigma with it in

' Romero_was born and grew up in New  Hollywood that he doesn’t care about

“‘It’s a very crude and rude and very
telling business,” Romero said. “It’s very
telling on the soul.” ' i '

Romero, whoicites ‘The Exorcist” and

{the original versionof “The Thing” among
some of his favorite horror movies, believes
that people are attracted to horror as a dis-

traction from their own lives. .
_ “[1-Iorror] upsets the apple cart and pro-

, vokes areaction inside the person which is
very much like a laugh,” Romero  “It’s
- a spontaneous reaction and-I think that’s

what horror islike, you may not want to

react, butit sneaks into your soul and makes ‘
  youjurnp-”   t t S  
Romero thinks that zombies are partic-

_ ularly  becauseof their resemblance to '

ordinary people. . V _

“It’s the blue-collar monster, it’s us,”
Romero said “More than any other monster,
it’s usinan altered state.” ; v

Among other things that scare the ﬁlm-
maker, “man’s inhumanityto man” tops the

'_. “Life, real life scaresme. I grew up ,
h the duck—and-cover days of the atom bomb,”

‘Romero said. “Also, the neighbors '—- you

- never know what they’re up to.” T . .
Above all, Romero said that his goal is T

notto “make it big,” but just to earrf a living

mak_ing movies. And he admits that he wish-I
, es people would ‘watch his movies to do

more than “ride the roller coaster.”

“Please take another look at-the stuff . A

and ﬁnd what. I’m saying there,” Romero
said. “Stop and smell the wilted roses.”

Jazz legend teaches course atPitt

LAUREN UNGER
Staff Writer

There were too many saxophones.
This was the response that Nathan Davis
received after he tried to participate in the
school marching band. I "

Many people would have given up at
this point, but Davis had too much invest-
ed in music. He had really gotten serious
about playing, performing in clubs and
touring. So instead he asked, “What do
you need?” When the answer was trom-
bones, he searched through ‘his ﬁiend’s
basement to find a dented, ratty old trom-
bone ﬁlled with mildew. ,

His mother, who was a nurse and
afraid of germs, helped him to soak it in
the bathtub, full of bleach and_ alcohol.

- Davis then carefully taped the ir1strument’s

“many. holes. When he returned to the
marching band, he took his place — last
chair in the trombone section, while keep-
ing up his saxophone in the jazz band.

Years later, after playing his saxo-
phone for multiple records with an exten-
sive list of jazz greats, Davis still has the
same determination. It may be this trait
that has helped him to ‘build a successful
music program at Pitt. . .

This program includes the history of
jazz course, one of the largest and most
popular courses oncampus, as well as an
improvisation course, a jazz arranger
course and the graduate program in etlmo-
musicology,- where students can earn their
doctorate in jazz or blues.

‘Davis’s attitude toward teaching has
also helped his academic successes. He
tries above all to keep it close to real life,
joking that his course is a sort of “back of
the bus” history, from the viewpoint of the
musician.

“I can talk about a lot of things that I

actually was there to witness, and not what
I read,” he said. “The performance and the

scholarly things, the theory and the histo-
ry, would have to go hand in hand with
actual performance.

Another element of his course is that
he tries to tell the truth about the history of
jazz as he experienced it, instead‘ of a
glossed over textbook-like history. In this
way, he is following the advice of his per-
sonal friend and mentor, Kenny Clarke,
the famous jazz drummer.

“When I talked to "Kenny Clarke, he
said, ‘Nat, if you take the job, you’ve got
to tell the truth. That’s the best thing you
can do because it will help jazz.”’

Clarke was also a major force in per-
suading Davis‘ to leave Paris and take the
teaching job at Pitt, even when other musi-

cians were pressing him to stay in Europe. 8
Pointing to the need for more black role .

models in the Pitt teaching. staff, Clarke
believed Davis now had a great opportuni-
ty to help.

Other famous musicians, such as
Dizzy Gillespie and Donald Byrd, added
that the ﬁeld for jazz teaching was opening
up, so people with degrees could really
help to push jazz. '

Now Davis also helps to push jazz in

his classes‘, but he takes a much more laid-
" back approach. ‘

“I see myself as a guide because I’ve

had more experience, but there are many .

things in many areas that I can learn from
students,” he said. _ '
For Davis, this is hardly just a'c1iche

,or saying. Aside from the varieties of

woodwind instruments, as well as the

trombone and the ﬂuegelhom, Davis is .

learning to play the guitar from one of his
students. For Davis, it’s just another part of

keeping some perspective and staying

busy. -
“The whole thing is being «real. I have

this expression: You’re born, you live, you ‘

die and the rest of the time you try to get
through the best you can,” he said.

The stage was set for a successful climb.
The individual runners went ﬁrst. They
were placed into heats of two and set‘to start

awaited the arrival of the runners with ner-

“Here they come!” shouted a volunteer.’

As everyone heard the footsteps of the

Curd, a junior and member of the foot— '

football conditioning. '

“It was a lot harder than I thought it was
going to be, but it was a lot of frm. It was real-
ly dry in the hallways, like a desert, it was
really dusty. All you could hear was yourself
breathing,” Curd said.

show a sign of fatigue and kept moving
around with an air of proud energy. '

Even though some admitted the race
hurt, all had smiles and positive looks on
their faces when they ﬁnished.

“That’s hell.” Fraser represented the Pitt ,

crew team that had seven participants in the
race. A
‘The best parts of the race were the last
two ﬂights and having the relay members on
every ninth ﬂoor. They were really encour-
aging to all of us,” Schmidt said.

. In the end, all seemed happy with their
performances, but only a few could take

home the prize money. The individual male
and female winners, Brenton Hull and Alissa
Hull, are brother and sister.

Alissa, a sophomore, is training for the

Pittsburgh marathon in May and used the

climb as practice. .

‘The best thing about the race was ﬁn-
ishing it,” she said.

Brenton, a freshman, did not prepare
much for the race, but thought it would still
be a good challenge and the win surprised
him.

“In the beginning you realize that you
are only on the l1th_ﬂoor and still have so
many to go. It is really a mental race,” he
said. .

Four Sigma Chi fraternity brothers won

the relay division. Sophomores Jesse
Lindsay, Tom Giarratano, Jeff Motter and
Geoff Bristol sprinted their way to victory in
2 minutes, 53 seconds.

“It was a lot of frm and we did it a lot

. faster than we expected,” Lindsay said.

Following Alissa Hul1’s _ﬁrst place ﬁnish
in the women’s competition, medical stu-
dents Gottshall and Schmidt placed second
and third respectively. In the men’s competi-
tion, behind Brenton Hull were Wﬂliarn
McCoy in second place and Matt Greig in
third. The group that won second place in the
relay, coming in only two seconds behind the
winners, was comprised of Regis Nelis,
Andy Mmay, Nick Krizah and Anthony
Delsignore.

Replacing Fido — with a clone?

To some, ﬁsh are completely replace-
able. One day, little Goldie is ﬂoating dead
at the top of the water, and within 24 hours,
you’ve bid Goldie farewell in a burial at sea
and Goldie II has already taken her place in
the bowl. '

Somehow this practice seems accept-
able with goldﬁsh. But what if you could do
the same with a beloved dog or eat? What if,
upon Fido’s death, you could replace him
with a genetically identical Fido II?

, Because of the technology that a Texas
company recently developed, this possibili-
ty may become a reality. The company,
Genetic Savings & Clone, recently succeed-
ed in producing a clone of a 2-year-old cali-
co cat, Rainbow. The Feb. 21 issue of the
journal Nature will publish the details of the
company’s undertaking.

Scientists and researchers speculate that
if the results of the kitty ‘cloning can be
duplicated, there may be a considerable
market for pet owners wishing to purchase
genetic replicas of their deceased pets.

Anyone who has experienced the death
of a pet knows how deeply the loss of such
loyal companions can resonate. But is pet
cloning really a viable and ethically sound
antidote to that grief?

Upon hearing of the Rainbow clone, the
Humane Society issued a statement in oppo-
sition to pet cloning, saying that cloning will
only add to the pet overpopulation problem.

This is perhaps the greatest potential
short-tenn consequence of pet cloning.
While those who can afford it will pay to

clone favorite pets, millions of stray dogs
and cats will continue to live homeless exis-
tences or face death in shelters that cannot
afford to care for so many animals.

The long—term psychological implica-
tions are even more wonisome. If pet
cloning becomes common, people may
adopt the mindset that life is disposable.
Who will feel the need to invest time and
money ‘in Fluffy’s safety and health care
when a new version can be purchased?

Genetically identical doesn’t mean
exactly the ‘same, though. Pets’ personalities
are in part shaped by experience, as are peo-
ple’s. It’s unfair to assume that a clone will
behave just as the original pet did.

Rainbow’s clone didn’t even look like
her predecessor. Because coat color in cats is
determined by the pattem of cell replication
in the embryo, the process is governed only‘
partially by genetics. More importantly,
some cloned animals have experienced
severe medical problems and have aged at
excessively rapid rates. .

Genetic Savings & Clone has already
invested $3.7 million in the Rainbow project
and in attempts at dog cloning. Wouldn’t our
society be improved if this money could be
spent improving technology that beneﬁts the
health of living animals or people?

The negative implications of cloning
animals would only be magniﬁed in human
cloning experiments. Let’s hope that scien-
tists, the government and the general public
will realize there’s nothing like the real thing
when it comes to both people and pets.

Mario deserves torplay
in the Olympics

Mario Lemieux is the most

inﬂuential athlete in Pittsburgh histo-
ry. Without Lemieux, there
would not be a hockey team
in this city. We would prob-
ably be watching the
Portland, Penguins instead.
Lemieux gave more to
this city than most of the
people born here have. In
1984, the year he came to
town, the Pens were a
ﬁnancial mess. Statistically

Penguin legacy. After his departure
from the game, the team fell into bank-
ruptcy. Lemieux pur-
chased the up-for-sale club
and vowed to never let the
Pens leave Pittsburgh. Last
season, he came out of
retirement to lead his crew
to one of its most exciting
playoff runs. This array of
selﬂess moves won the
hearts of every true hock-
ey fan in ‘town. Many peo-
ple simply refer to

Lemieux had to single-

_ handedly put people in the stands. Any

money the team made was because the
fans, came to watch him play. .

Since then, he has been linked to
all of the success _the Penguins have
ever experienced. Sure, other players
helped along the way, but it ‘was
Lerrrieux who brought them here. He
made this team respectable and con-
vinced other talent to actually come
play for Pittsburgh. They knew that
with Lemieux in the lineup, they could
win.

Do you think Jaromir Jagr would
have made it as long as he did with the

Penguins if Lemieux wasn’t his line,

mate‘? No, he would have run off to
“sunshine and girls” the second he got
good. Lemieux-united those teams and
led them to two consecutive Stanley
Cups. Before he retired in 1997, he
transformed the laughing stock of the
league into -the most feared offensive
power of the 1990s.

Entering a new decade, he would
continue to write new pages into his

Lemieux as “Mario,” as if
he were an old friend.

So cut your buddy some slack. I
can’t believe that anyone in their right
mind can call Lemieux “selfish” for
playing in the Olympics. This team is
built on his unselﬁshness. He sacri-
ficed his. health for the Penguins.
Playing through back spasms, cancer
and a broken wrist, Lemieux always
wanted to see his adopted city succeed.
Because of his passion, we did;
Arguably,’ we should call the team the
Pittsburgh Lemieux because without
him, they would only resemble slow,
ﬂightless Penguins waddling around
on the ice. '

At age 36, Lemieux is, in hockey
years, an_old geezer. His playing days

are very much numberedand he is try- '

ing to accomplish as much as possible
in his ﬁnal seasons. That is why he

wants to play in the 2002 Olympics. It‘

is one of the few challenges he has yet

, to undertake. With the NHL being so

Presidents Day:

Today marks the observed holi-
day of George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln’s birthdays, both of
whom had the good graces to be born
10 days and 77 years apart, during a
month that sorely needed a holiday.

But these are not

called property. ,

Conversely, Lincoln was a man in
conﬂict, but still a man worth our cel-
ebration. He faced a nation divided on
racial, social, military, geographic
and economic lines. Lincoln con-
fronted a country divided

names mentioned lightly.
Anyone in the United

dney Bergman

Columnist

—— one as delicate as a
house of cards and crum-
bling just as quickly —
and persevered. By the
time of his death, these
united states became the
United States, a country
rather than a consortium.

Perhaps ' equally
important, but less recog-
nized, was his internal

ing into do.ts on a timeline
or yet another text in sagging book-
bags. '

This problem partially arises
because we are never given a clear
picture of who these men were or for
what they stood. ' l

Today we will celebrate the birth-
day of two men -— two presidents —
who grappled with the issue of race
and emerged neither victorious nor
vanquished, a fact that many versions
of history omit.

How are we to celebrate them .

when they are not without faults?
How can we acknowledge their lega-
cies —— both good and bad — if the
holiday consists mostly of price
reductions at car dealerships and
patriotic banners hung outside dis-
count malls and funeral homes? A
To be frank, Washington is — as
historical ﬁgures go— not that inter-
esting. He’s all isolationism and mili-
tary tactics, wooden teeth and staid
diplomacy. Moreover, he did not
combat the issue of race as much as
avoid it. He lived in Virginia. He held
slaves, which he freed in his will.
Reﬂecting this, history books talk of
his underdog triumph as a general and
his duties as the first president. They
say little of the human beings he

battle with these issues.

Lincoln fought his confusion over.

slavery and race quite publicly. He
was the ultimate contradiction: an
abolitionist racist. It is this struggle,
this desire to resolve his racism and
his “personal wish that all men,
everywhere could be free,” that drove
him.

He wrote these words in an 1862

letter to The New York Times. Four _

years earlier, Lincoln stated in debate
that “there is a physical difference
between the white and black races
which  will for ever forbid the two

races living together on terms of

social and political equality.”
Many more instances of this dis-

parity in thought occur. Part of his .

standard stump speech was the state-
ment that, “I am not now nor have
been in favor of making voters or
jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying
them to hold office, nor to intermarry
with white people.”

Yet in a sweeping sentence in his
second inaugural address, Lincoln
said of slavery in the United States
that “every drop of blood drawn by
the lash shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword  so it must
still be said that, ‘The judgments of
the Lord are true and righteous.”’ C

Who exactly are we honoring?

ILLUSTRATION BY SHUCHI SHARMA/EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATOR

Thus we are presented with both
Lincoln the racist and Lincoln the
emancipator. Which are we to
choose? How are we to interpret these

opposing views? Surely we should.
not rub his picture off the penny or V

sandblast it from Mount Rushmore
because he felt this way. After all,
Jefferson ‘and Washington owned
slaves and are still considered patri-
ots. .

But comparative tolerance of oth-
ers is not the same as compassion or

‘acceptance. We cannot, in good con-

science, celebrate‘ Lincoln’s racism,
but we cannot deny his anti-racist
achievements either. We are thus

greeted with the same problem as
Lincoln was: Which is of greater
importance — a man’s personal prej-
udices or his fundamental desire to
see his countrymen free?

Not honoring Lincoln would
mean erasing a critical and still sig-
nificant part of United States history.
His words and actions tell a story
absent from blaring car ads and stars‘-
and-stripes motifs, one that mirrors

the nation’s toils with race’s legacy in

history.

Lemieux has earned a chance to play for Canadian team

McCarthy, page 6

accommodating to the games, he, like many other
players, wants to represent his country. He is from
Canada, where hockey is religion. Representing the
country in the Olympics is a spiritual quest and the
gold medal is the Holy Grail.

Lemieux, who spent the majority of his profes-
sional career playing in America, wants to show his
homeland that he can thrill them as well. He has
already provided Pittsburghers with countless mem-
ories and deserves_the chance to provide Canada
with a few. Who are we, the benefactors of a lifetime
of highlight reel plays, to stand in the way of the rest
of the world getting to experience his magniﬁcence?

We shouldn’t greedily demand that he continue to
spend every second of his waning career here.

If Lemieux needs a few days off during the reg-
ular season to rest up for Salt Lake City, let him. If
he wants to take next year off to open a Mexican
restaurant chain, let him. Lemieux already rung up a
bill this city can never‘ repay. Unlike 99 percent of
athletes, he still cares about the well—being of the
town that made him famous.

If we don’t make it to the playoffs this year, it is
not Lemieux’s fault. The team is struggling because
they are inexperienced and injured. But Lemieux
still cares; he still wants to help. If we somehow
miraculously make it into the postseason, it will only
be because Lemieux rallies the troops. C

"sci-‘.LAAtrsAA.A,aL'.'a&LaA$

Lemieux taking a few games off should remind _

us, if anything, of what it will be like when he is
gone for good. So shut up about the Olympics. Get
off his back (it’s already sore enough) and wish him
luck. If he wins that gold medal, it could further reju-
venate his love of the sport. Maybe he’ll even stick
around to play in the next winter games.

Every secondof ice time he takes here until his
next, and ﬁnal, retirement is a personal gift from the
unselfish Lemieux to Pittsburgh. Considering that he
has spoiled us rotten for almost two decades, we
should’ be happy to still be getting anything at all.

CMU art student shacks up in
silence for three months
dressed as a lobster

JESSICA MCCULLOUGH
The Pitt News

‘One lobster. "Three ﬂoors. One house. _One laborer... 
Two blackboots. One red ponytail. Limitless spectatorsj. =

One performance. What do these oddities have in com-
mon? Bill Kofmehl III. Confused yet? That’s the point.

Kofmehl is a student at Carnegie Mellon University
with an offbeat approach to education. He’s enrolled in the
university, but takes no classes. Instead, Kofmehl under-
went rigorous negotiations with CMU’s administration to
opt for what they call “an external study.”

Kofmehl is currently planning to shack up in the
three-story, 2,800- square foot house that he’s been avidly
building for about a year now. Its frame and serrri-shell
have been completed in the area designed for the art
department beside ClVIU’s Doherty Hall. Kofmehl sal-
vaged scraps for his project from construction sites around
campus. He expects to complete his house this fall.

Throughout last year, Kofmehl put on an array of '

multifaceted performances relating to’ this construction
ranging from a lecture on digging to a lecture on martial
art tactics. His nextperforrnance is a momentous step in
his career because of the duration. of time it will ﬁll.‘
Starting Feb. 1, Kofmehl entered his house with plans
to stay there until May 3 in solitary conﬁnement in and
around the construction; to ensure this stip- ‘
ulation of the performance, he will be
attached to his still-under—construction
house by what he refers to as his “umbilical
cor ,” a length of yellow plastic rope. He
will also spend these three months in ‘silence and without
any time devices. He will also be dressed as a lobster.

The purpose of this type of performance artis to ‘

intrigue the audience and to invoke mind expansion.
“Bill is the best I’ve ever seen at it,” said CMU grad-

uate Tom Birdsey. “It’s very surreal and it’s not just one

idea that comes across. [In performance art], you try to

confuse the audience until each person comes up with.

their own response, their own meaning.”

During this speciﬁc performance, Kofmehl will com-
plete a variety of audacious feats. There will eventually be
Nordic Track equipment strapped to the roof of the house
that Kofmehl plans to use several times a day while mak-
ing noises out of tubes for an alteration of a musical com-
position. He is also installing several ﬁremen’s poles
inside the house to slide and climb from ﬂoor to ﬂoor.

He held an open dress rehearsal followed by a catered
reception on Jan. 26 at CMU’s Alumni Hall to promote
his performance. About 10 people attended. Kofmehl

encourages any inquiring to stop (1 see c
ongoingperformance. Just be sure not to call him “Bill,”
or even Mr. Kofmehl.

' “It is key that Bill Kofmehl isn’t entering — it’s my .

character,” Kofmehl said. He plans to play the role of his
lobster character for the entire performance.

During one visit to the house after the performance
began, visitors watched his lobster—costumed character

‘ ’ climb to the partially completed-roof of his house toernit .5
noises from a cardboard tube and a bullhorn, thesounds D fl

ultimately resembled blowing on a conch shell

Following the musical interlude, the
artist carried a red ceramic creature in the
appearance of a serpent-necked Pegasus to
an opening in the house. He tied his yellow
umbilical cord to the bizarre animal and left
the house to empty a milk jug of yellow liquid —— the
words “piss jug” had been written on the side in black
marker. -

As he emptied his jug, a woman dressed entirely in
white mysteriously appeared and sat on the ‘horse —
although he’s supposed to bealone. Unforttmately, the
artist remained silent and in character throughout the
entire duration of the visit.

The onlyvdownside to Koﬁnehl’s project is that he
must tear his house down after his performance is com-
pleted. -

“’Ihey basically told me I have to deconstruct it for
liability purposes before I graduate,” he said.

Kofmehl hopes that at the very least, his performance
will provide an outlet from the everyday art world of
museums and theaters. There’s no question that his
motives will be satisﬁed. '

some of the “Pirates” players, including Pedro
Porro as Ralph Rackstraw, Catrina Lennon as
Josephine, Bill Nolte as Dick Deadeye and Myrna
Paris as Little Buttercup, with the same stage.

From the moment the audience enters to ﬁnd
the seats at the O’Reilly Theater, they are struck
by the appearance of the exquisite set, which gives
the impression that a 19th century clipper ship just
broke through the back wall of the stage. The ship
comprises the entire set, beautifully decorated and

V adorned with wood planks, two curving staircases

up to a second tier and a giant portrait of Queen
Victoria. The show hasn’t started and already it’s
impressive.

The acting does not betray these expectations,
but rather, it surpasses them. Within the ﬁrst sec-

si Climb aboard the

ore east than bite

onds of the comedy, the lights rise, and the audi-
ence receives its ﬁrst taste of what is to come as
the rousing sea chantey, “We Sail The Ocean
Blue,” raises the audience’s spirits and almost rais-
es some from its seats with its shocking energy. At
no moment in the performance should anyone be
bored. Between» the songs, constant movement,
and colorful costumes and characters, there can be
no denying that it is a stimulating sensory experi-
ence.

The story is that of a sailor in love with a girl
above his station in life. His love, the captain’s
daughter, is already set to marry the Admiral of the
Queen’s Navy who, by the way, has never been on

' a boat and is old enough to be her grandfather. All

of this makes for several surprising and comical
twists, most of which come within the last 15 rnin-
utes of the performance, so keeping an open eye
and ear is well recommended. '
But don’t let the hilarious laughter and jaunty
songs fool you. Behind it all lurks a commentary
upon class difference and the absurdity of judging
people by where they stand on the social ladder.
The ludicrously pretentious and digniﬁed Sir
Joseph Porter in particular sums up all the estab-
lished rules and expectations of being a member of
the upper—crust gentry. .
“H.M.S Pinafore” will play Downtown at the
O’Reilly Theater through March 3. Tickets for the
performance are available -at the door or by calling
(412) 316-1600 or at the Pittsburgh Public Theater
Web site, www.ppt.org. Prices range from $28 to
$50 but full-time students and people 26 years old
and under may purchase single tickets for $10 ——
on Fridays and Saturdays this rate only applies to

mance.

La Bete

Directed by Ronald Allan-Lindblom
Pittsburgh Playhouse

Through Mar..3

(412) 621 -4445

7;‘; .

Ten minutes into the ﬁrst. act of “La Bete,” a man arrives
on stage, interacts with the other actors for a moment or two,
then begins a 45-minute monologue. Amusement follows
when the other actors try to interject a comment, only to be
silenced.

This is the funniest bit of the whole play. -

A satiric commentary on plays in general, the Pittsburgh
Playhouse’s current comedy, “La Bete,” which means “The
Beast” in French, follows the lives of a royal acting troupe
in France in 1654. Because the play is meant to be a tribute
to the life and plays of ‘French playwright, Moliere, the
actors speak in rhyming iambic pentameter, most of the time
so trite that audience members can easily guess each fol-
lowing line. i

The play starts with Elornire (an anagram of Moliere),

played by Tom J. Schaller, the presumed head of the acting '

company, storming out on stagefollowed by his confidante,
the hunchbacked Bej art, portrayed by Richard Keitel. Prince
Conti, played by Robert Haley, outrages Elornire when he
suggests that Valere, a common street performer, join his
ensemble. It is at this point that the long—winded actor,
Valere (Heath Lambert), makes his grand entrance and
seemingly never leaves. 1 , . '

The second act is ﬁlled with numerous references to
plays and playwrights. The servant Dorine, played by
Rachel E. Ayers, speaks only in words that rhyme in the
“oo” persuasion, as in “blue,” “new” and “shoe,” much to
the irritation of anyone whois trying to talk to her. Valere is
asked by the prince to put on one of his plays so Elomire can

see how wonderful he is, and Valere emerges in full costume _

and makeup to put on a rather ridiculous show for the prince
with the troupe. ,

P Lamberts delivers a strong performance despite the fact
that Valere merely drones’ on for pages and pages on end.
The other actors support him rather well, with the exception
of Haley, who speaks in a monotone voice, even when his
princely character gets mad — and you know he’s mad
because he stomps his foot in typical bratty royal fashion. 4

“La Bete” drags on to close with a relatively somber
monologue by Elomire, and the curtain closes after he exits,
leaving Dorine standing alone on stage. Perhaps “La Bete”
is a variety of humor that is only funny to those who are
most dedicated to the art form.

Bruiser

Starring Jason Flemyng, Nina
Garbiras and Andrew Tarbet
Directed by George Romero

ﬂrtfrl/2

“Don’t disappoint me, Tom. I’ve been
disappointed enough.” '

These two simple sentences, uttered by
the faceless Henry J Creedlow (Jason
Flemyng), sums up the core of “Bruiser.”
The wimpy everyman is forced to take con-
trol of his life from the hands of the people

L around him. '

Henry is-arhuman doormat, walked on
and over by his wife Janine (Nina Garbiras),
his boss lVIilos (Peter Stonnare) and his

(“best ﬁiend” James (Andrew Tarbet). He is

virtually invisible to everyone around him,
even those close to him. He never stands up
for himself or for anything, choosing instead
to live out violent fantasies in his head Even
his only deﬁning characteristic, his face, is
taken away when he wakes up one morning
to ﬁnd it replaced by a white, skin-tight,

- faceless mask. With his mask, Henry

decides it’s time to take control of his life.
It would seem that the concept of the

mask representing Henry’s faceless person-
. ality is too overt, despite its genuine creepi-

ness and its pinhole eyes. But the mask

depersonal1zes' - ‘the-murders‘Henry comm” ‘ it_s, 

bulfering his "character and his actions, and
allowing the audience to remain somewhat
sympathetic to Henry’s plight

' The success of“Bruise1” lies in director
George Romero’s ability to create and sus-
tain this sense of sympathy. Romero accom-

. plishes this feat through his meticulous and

constant bombardment of slig_h_ts on Henry,
especially before he becomes faceless. It is
so well done that when Henry ﬁnally real-

izes that he needs to murder to be noticed, it

is easier to cheer for him than to..be repulsed

- “Bmiser,” unfortunately, runs out _of
steam by the end, settling for a cliched.clos-
ing. Everything up to the end keeps 
the uadition of a smart thriller rather than a
slasher movie. ‘ After Henry reaps his

seemingly with a personality and backbone,
making the mask unnecessary. Ending the
ﬁlm this way would have elicited some kind
of social meaning. Everything the ﬁlm
works toward is destroyed when, in the last
seconds, his mask rettuns in a malicious
Michael Myers way..

' ThisistheﬁrstﬁlmthatRomerohasnit

, shot at least part of in Pittsburgh. Thankfully,

it works for the story because of the faceless
exterior of the Ontario locations used for
production, which parallel the themes of the
movie. ’
. Itisunfortunatethatthe samelengths
couldn’t have been utilized when working
out the ending. If it had, ,“Bruise1’? could
have been a decent social critique instead of

’ the mere entertaining thriller that it is.

Weezer , A
With Saves the Day and Ozma
Tonight, 7:30 p.m. _. o
Mellon Arena, all ages, $29 A
(412) 642-1 800

In the last lines of Weezer’s second

album, Pinkerton, frontman Rivers in 

Cuomo sings" “I ain’t never coming
back  I’m sorry.” Strangely enough,
after Pinkert_on’s commercial and criti-
cal achievement failed to match that of

‘their 1994 debut, it almost seemed as

though Weezer- was never con1ing back.

 Over the next few years, the band
basically disappeared, its -members
worked on side projects and rumors sur-
faced that Cuomo had completely gone
mad. Meanwhile, a cult of sorts devel-

oped around Pinkerton, an energetic but
beautiful album aboutromantic frustra J

tion and rejection. ’

After four years, Weezer ﬁnally

resurfaced. They started touring ‘(and
selling out) clubs all over the country,

and then released their fourth studio»

album last May, which, like their 1994

debut, was also titled Weezer. The
. record became popularly known as “the

Green Album,” due to the lime green
background in front of which the band
poses on the album cover.

With this release, it seems as
though Weezer made an uncanny stylis-
tic return to their successful first album,
which in the same way became known
as “the Blue Album” due to its cover’s

blue background. Even" the songwriting a

style on it is reminiscent of (but

’ nowhere as good as) the band’s debut,

full of power pop party sing-alongs. _

“The Green Album” was parmed by
most critics and disappointed numerous
Weezer fans \with higher expectations of

the band’s resurrection; On the other
hand, it has also been a huge _commer-
cial success, and went platinum last .
September. Its three singles, “Hash

Pipe,” .‘5Island in the Sun” and
“Photograph” have been all over mod-
em rock radio and MTV. They even
found their way onto European air-
waves. Needless to say, Weezer’s fan
base has ‘only continued to grow. While
they were once playing only small
clubs, they’re now playing huge arenas.

So it’s not peculiar to ﬁnd Weezer
playing ‘at Mellon Arena tonight, with
token emo bands Ozma and Saves the
Day opening up for them. It promises to
be quite a show — at least once Weezer
steps on stage, strums the first chord of
their opening song and a humongous
‘W’ made of light bulbs illuminates the

stage. _ ‘_
qThere’s something1you’ll notice
about Rivers .Cuomo these days: he

looks happy and he’ll actually talk to .

the audience betweemsongs. He’s not
the estranged, misunderstood, silent
genius that everyone thought him to be.
He no longer puts personal -implications
into the songs he writes. It’s almost like
Weezer on Prozac.

With another album due out in
April, supposedly titled Maladroit, it’s
all smiles for Cuomo and company. You
can count on them to give you another
array of hum-able radio hits. And for
those who long for emotional angst of
the Pinkerton era, it’s more than a lost
cause. Weezer is on an island in the sun.
They ain’t never coming back.

A musician knows he’s made it in
the best possible way when he’s all
over MTV2. . . -

MTV lost any legitimacy it ever

’ had as a serious music station at about

the same time as The Real World pre-
miered. If a musician is on constant
rotation there, sure, the record will sell
millions, but will it be respected musi-
cally? Probably not. MTV2 serves as a
happy medium — plenty of records

sold and respect as a serious music
station. ' , ' ' ,
That said, perhapsyou caught the
video ’ for Rufus _Wainwrigh_t’s
“Califomia” on MTV2. Or maybe you
saw “Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,”
Maybe you even sawthe video for the
exquisite “April Fools.” ‘
If you did happen to witness one

. ‘of those videos, you likely caught on

to what the music world has been pro-
claiming for a couple years now:

' Rufus (Wainwright is seriously cool.‘

He’s got it all: the melodies, the
lyrics, the voice. He’s got creative
instrumentals and his sound is unique
enough to guarantee that anyone who
has ever heard him will be able to pro-
claim “Oh, that’s Rufus Wainwright”-
every time they ever hear himiagain.
He’s the son of two semi-famous
musicians (OK, they’re famous

enough to make him cool, but not
enough to*tum his life into a celebrity
sideshow). And he’s attractive to boot.

Moreover, he had the good sense
to come to Pittsburgh during a tour
with only nine dates. If there’s a show
worth pulling out your trusty fake ID
for, Wainwright’s performance tomor-
row at M might be it. That’s right, it’s
yet another Pittsburgh show that
excludes a huge chunk of the musi-
cian’s fan base by being 21 and over.

‘When will promoters learn?

But if you’re lucky enough to
have already reached the arbitrary age
that allows you attend a show at which
you may or may not consume alcohol,-
go see Rufus Wainwright before he
becomes too popular to play at'clubs

like M. It’s only a matter of time, after

all. The MTV2 gods have fated it. I

well, as it was blasted by the No. ll-ranked
Mountaineers, 32-2. “ ‘

'Friday’s meeting matched up two top 25 teams,
both from the Eastern Wrestling League. West Virginia
(8-2 overall, 4-0 EWL) sent six ranked wrestlers to the
mat Friday night, and it proved to be too much for Pitt
(12-5, 4-2 EWL). '

West Virginia scored its first victory with a 4-2 win
and took a 3-0 lead in the first match. After going to
overtime, No. 19-ranked Billy Smith defeated Justin
Giovinco in the 149-pound matchup.

Zach Doll became the second Panther to fall when
West Virgir1ia’s No. 10 Joe Carr got the decision in the

Limkemann not just a

success in the pool

JASON YANDER
The Pitt News

Eric Limkemarm isnot your average
college student, but don’t let the ﬁngernail
polish fool you. ‘

When the sophomore isn’t excelling
in the classroom, Limkemarm is accelerat-
ing in the swimming pool. .

Valedictorian of his high school,
Limkemann sports a 4.0 grade point aver-
age and three Pitt records,-including the
500-yard, . 1,000—yard and 1,650-yard
freestyle.

Fingemail polish or not, coach Chuck
Knoles‘ is impressed — impressed with
Limkemarm’s swimming accolades, his
academic success and his great personali-

“He’s a kid who can feel comfortable
dyeing his "hair and wearing ﬁngernail pol-
ish,” Knoles said./“But he can also feel
comfortable in the midst of the most intel-
ligent academics on campus without being
ﬂustered at all. He has a 4.0 in the Honors
College after all.” " ‘ -

According to Knoles, the earmark of r
a good distance swimmer is, intelligence
and Limkemarm combines -his lmowledge
with fast race times to complete the pack-

age of a quality distance swimmer.

Limkemarm grew up in a rural area
just outside of Fort Wayne, Ind., on a 35-
acre farm. The Hoosier traded country life
for a four-year stay in the urban jungle
called Oakland. 9 . 9

Ironically, Limkemann did not com-
pete on a high school swim team because
Woodlan High School in New Haven,
Ind., was too small to have a swim team.
But Limkemarm excelled in a club team,
where he earned the 1999-2000 Indiana
Swirmning Inc. Swimmer of the Year.

“Not having a high school team made
it difficult,” Limkemarm said. “Not a lot of
schools recruited me because of the lack
of a high school team, but Pitt saw me
with my club. Pitt’s an up-and-coming
program in the nation. It’s getting better
and better. I’m really excited to be here,”
Limkemann said.

' Thus far, Limkemarm’s tenure at Pitt
has been a successful one. His freshman
year, Limkemann won the 1,650 freestyle
and ﬁnished second in the 500-yard
freestyle at the Big East Championships‘.

After a ﬂourishing start to his Pitt
career at the 2001 Big East
Championships, Limkemarm hopes to
build on that with even more victories at
this year’s ﬁrst meet on Feb. 21.

Currently, Limkemarm is ranked ﬁrst
in three official events in the Big East,
including the 500 and 1,650 freestyle plus
the 400 individual medley. .

Limkemarm admits the individual

medley has not always been his _best

event, but after an unsuccessful attempt at
the event his freshman year, he has
bounced back this season.

Not only is his list of goals complete
for his sophomore year, Limkemarm, like
many swimmers, has his junior and senior
years “plarmed” also.

“I’m hoping to reach the NCAA meet
this season (late March),” Limkemarm
said. ‘ -

“Next year, I want to place in the top

10 at NCAAs and my final year, I want to '

win at NCAAs.’ It’s been a goal of mine

for a while and I’m going to stick with it.” '

With ‘much of his time devoted to
swimming, academics and sleeping,
Limkemarm doesn’t have much ‘time for
himself. '

When he isn’t practicing at 6 a.m. or
studying at 6 p.m., Limkemann is going to

bed at 8:30 p.m. And when he’s not sleep- '
ing, he’s playing basketball with his team-_

mates.

f‘Athletics are a big’ thing with me,”
Limkemarm said. “I’m so competitive and
I need to compete. It’s ﬁm to play basket-
ball with the guys. Swimmers are unique
people and we seem to relate better to
each other.”
/I Even though he was raised in the
country, Limkemarm is beginning to relate

also to metropolitan living. The experi-.

ence of city life hasn’t changed him total-
ly.

Overall, Limkemarm” has adjusted to
city life in‘ Pittsburgh, but he will always
have a special place for the country life
back home in Indiana. . .

“I miss grass,” Limkemann said. “I
appreciate my country life a little more
now. Schenley Park is nice, but it’s just
not my backyard. There’s always going to
be a part ofme that will miss living in the
country.” ' ~

J aron Brown, who started on Saturday night, contributed to Pitt’s Win by

adding 13 points and three steals.

A tale of two halves for
the firstplace Panthers  

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

Itmay have been a great uni-

form switch. Or perhaps the
Panthers ate their Wheaties.
Whatever took place at halftime
turned Saturday night’s men’s bas-
ketball game between Pitt and West
Virginia into a case of Jekyll and
Hyde. \

The game proved to be one of
numbers + and in particular, shoot-
ing percentages. .

The Mountaineers were-on ‘fire
in the first half, shooting 59 percent
and scoring 45 points against the
best defense in the Big East. But the
Panthers answered back by domi-
nating the second half and putting
on an offensive display of their own
on their way to” an 85-75 victory.

The Mountaineers shocked a
national television audience and the

home crowd by opening the contest
with a, 10-0 run against the Panthers,
more closely resembling ‘ their

ranked opponents than a team that V
'won’t even qualify for the Big'East

Tournament. _

West Virginia slowed down
momentarily to»a11ow abasket by
point guard Brandin Knight but con-

tinued to tear up the court, making.

its first lO—of-15 shots and continu-

ing to shoot near 70 percent for ‘

much of the half.
West Virginia entered halftime
with an improbable 45-37 lead.
Perhaps the Mountaineers were

sparked by change, playing under

interim coach Drew Catlett for the
first time after he took over, follow-
ing the unexpected retirement of his
uncle, Gale Catlett, two days earlier.

The 45 points the Panthers gave

Brandin Knight scored 11 of Pitt’s first 13 points on Saturday night as he kept
Pitt within striking distance throughout the team’s shaky first half.

GREG KUESTER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Comeback, page 15

to gain momentum, guard Julius Page
slammed home an alley—oop pass from
Knight. It looked like instant replay one
minute and 18 seconds later, as Page
dunked another mid—air pass from
Knight, capping a 10-2'run.

“The two lob dunks were big plays
and got our guys pumped,” Howland
said.

Knight, who had three steals, knew
all along that his team would bounce
back.

“We thought that they gave us their
best in the first half,” he said. “They

. outrebounded us and we weren’t play-

ing good defense. We knew if we
picked up our defense we would get
back in the game.”

And he was right. The Panthers,
who were 4-3 when trailing at the half,

held the Mountaineers to only 31 per-

cent from the ﬁeld in the second half.’

West Virginia then returned to what
made them the worst team inrthe Big
East his season: poor defense.

The tight Pitt defense led to more
open shots, as Pitt made 68, percent of
its shots in the second half.

“Because they were pressuring us,”
Knight said, “I would get more open
shots.” 8 . - ' E ‘

The up-tempo style ﬁnally caught
up to West Virginia, as they had 10
turnovers in the second half.

Howland was impressed with his A

team’s resolve.

- “The credit really has to go to our-

players to bounce back and play great

. defense,” he said.

Donatas Zavackas, who Howland
calls the team’s “best post defender,”
shut down West Virginia leading scorer
Chris Moss, holding him to seven
points, more than 10 below his season

  Panthers net comeback win in Morgantown

the team with 14 -points, making four-
of-six shots.

For the game, Hargett led West
Virginia with 26 points, but only made
two-of-seven shots in the second half.

‘.‘I know he’s very explosive and
makes shots,” Knight said. “When he
gets into a rhythm he’s tough. But in the
second half, he wasn’t hitting too
many.” 0

Penn Hills product Drew. Schiﬁnio
best exemplified West Virginia’s
efforts. He was second on the team with
13 points, but his out-of-control, ball-
yard style led to three turnovers and an
ejection for a ﬂagrant elbow. 0

Pitt, on the other hand, kept its cool,
getting contributions from many play-
ers. Along with Knight and Zavackas,
Page hit six-of-10 shots for 13 points,
while Jaron Brown had 13 points and
three steals. 0

“Every game we have been having
different guys step up. Our guys never
think we are out of a game,” Knight
said.

Interim head coach Drew Catlett,
who is ﬁlling in for his uncle and
coaching "legend, Gale Catlett, was
impressed with Pitt.

“They’ve got a Very good team,” he
said. “They are very well-coached and
got a great point-guard and good sup-
port players.”

Except for an oblique injury caus-
ing Chevon Troutman to sit out the
game, Howland did not think the six-
day layoff hurt his team. '

“The layoff was good for us. You
know we had some energy in the stretch
run,” he said. “The only bad part was
Chevy Troutman got hurt.”

Pitt can clinch at least a tie for ﬁrst
place in the Big East West division with
a win in its next game against Rutgers.
The game is on_Feb. 21 at the Fitzgerald

average.

Field House, with tip-off set for 7:30

The junior forward was second on p.m.

Defensive performance in second half fuels Pitt

Two halves, page 17 ~

up was the second—most allowed by Pitt in the
first half of a game this season. The only team to
score more first half points against Pitt this year
was Notre Dame, who registered 49 in the Irish’s
Jan. 30 victory in South Bend, Ind.

Much of the inspired offense found by the
Mountaineers was fueled by freshman Jonathan
Hargett’s 18 first half points, in which he hit
seven-of—l4 shots. Hargett finished with a team-

high 26 points, including four-of-10 from three--

point land.

But the Panthers were not about to let the
Mountaineers’ fairy tale half be replicated. Not if
Knight had any say in the matter.

It was Pitt’s turn-to dominate, led by Knight
who ‘finished with a career-high 29 points and

continuously pulled off plays with backcourt

_mate Julius Page that appeared to be effortless.

Knight was 10-of-18 in field goal attempts,
including six-of-13m from behind the arc. He
also chipped in with six assists, three steals and
two rebounds.

“When you look at the stats, you have to say
he is a candidate for player of the year,” Howland 1
said.

Knight’s one weakness, as it has been all sea-
son, was his free-throw shooting. Knight was
three-of-eight from the charity stripe, but his
inability to shoot free throws‘ is not as pertinent
in a game that does not come down to the buzzer.

His ability to shoot field goals_ is.

It was Knight’s three-pointer that gave the
Panthers their first lead of the game,’ 52-52, with
15 minutes,Y4_s._ec_onds remaining in the game.‘

Not to be outdone by their struggling Big East
rivals, the Panthers went on a 10-0 run of their
own to‘ open up a 69-56 lead with just over nine
minutes left on the clock.

' Pitt never looked back. .

j The Mountaineers would move within eight
but get no closer, as the Panthers had the hot

"hand, shooting as high as 80 percent a little more

than halfway through» the second half. The
Panthers finished at 53 percent for the game.
The Panthers outscored the Mountaineers 48-

. 30 in the second half to cruise to the 85-75 victo-

ry. But as the case has beenmany times this sea-
son, the Panthers had to do things the hard way
by pulling out a come-from-behind win.

“We have been overcoming adversity all
year,” Knight said. “Our guys never think we are
out of a game.”
