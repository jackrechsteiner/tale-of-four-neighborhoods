Commitment to law

administrators insist

he three administra-

tors most involved in

the controversy over

Pitt’s Environmental Law Clinic

replied vigorously this week to a

Dec. 2 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

story that questioned their com-
mitment to the clinic.

In a point—by—point response
published in the Post-Gazette
yesterday, School of Law Dean
David Herring disputed the
story’s conclusion that Pitt has

‘been “more equivocal” than

other state-supported universi-
ties in defending environmental

lence the clinic.

Last summer, Pennsylvania.

legislators barred Pitt from
spending tax money on the clinic,
in retaliation for its work for
opponents of timbering in the
Allegheny National Forest. Pitt’s
administration responded by
billing the clinic monthly for
administrative and overhead
costs at a rate that could bank-
rupt the clinic in a little over a
year, according to clinic director
Thomas Buchele.

Buchele, Dean Herring and
other law school faculty are work-
ing on a plan to transform the
clinic into a separate, nonproﬁt
organization that would be af-
ﬁliated with — but no longer
part of —— the law school.

In his letter to the Post-Ga-
zette, Herring wrote: “We are
not ‘driving the clinic off cam-
pus,’ but are simply bringing our
organizational structure in line
with that at other public law
schools.”

Currently, the dean wrote,
Pitt is the only non—private uni-
versity that houses a clinic that is
free to pursue a wide range of
environmental law cases. Other
environmental law clinics that
the Post-Gazette compared with

_ Pitt’s,,are'.actually separate,non— 4 ~

This week’s Senate Council
discussion of the clinic contro-

who said he was surprised that
Nordenberg failed to mention
the Post-Gazette article in his
regular report to the Council.

“I am kind of astounded,”
Holland said, “that academic in-
tegrity at the University ﬁnds its
main defense in a metropolitan
newspaper.”

Nordenberg said his
administration’s defense of the
Environmental Law Clinic has

‘taken place mainly behind the
scenes. “Our approach from the -

outset,” the chancellor said, “has

itt senior Carrie Ann

Theisen — a B. Phil.

candidate and qua-

druple major in psychology, lin-

guistics, philosophy and German

— has been named as one of 40

Marshall Scholars nationwide for

2002, the British Embassy an-
nounced this week.

Theisen is the seventh Pitt

‘student since’ 1985 to win a

Marshall, one of the more com-
petitive and prestigious merit
scholarships in the United States.
The British Parliament created
the scholarships to commemo-
rate the Marshall Plan for re-
building Europe following
World War II.

During the last 17 years, Pitt
students have won more
Marshalls and Rhodes scholar-
ships (three) than any other
Pennsylvania college or univer-
sity — and, this week, three Pitt

students are interviewing for,
I Rhodes scholarships. ' I q I
' “Simply reaching" the inter- ,

view stage is inand of itself a real
accomplishment, given the level
of the competition” for Rhodes
scholarships, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg told Senate Coun-
cil on Dec. 3, after announcing

Theisen’s Marshall scholarship. .

Like the Rhodes, the Marshall
scholarship emphasizes charac-
ter as well as intellect. But while
a Rhodes restricts study to Ox-
ford University, a Marshall cov-

ers all educational costs and pro-

and psychology.

...“Cognitive science is-so new
and it includes so many disci-

plines,” said Theisen, of"

Boyerstown, Pa. “One of those
is artiﬁcial intelligence. It’s some-
thingl haven’t had the chance to
pursue yet, and it’s not some-
thing you can kind of pick up on
the by-and-by because it involves
computers and you really need
training in it.

“I ﬁgure I have the restof my

hall scholar

life to specialize, so for the next
two years I’m going to try to
broaden my horizons and think
about what area of cognitive sci-
ence most interests me.”

That horizon-broadening
approach is typical of Theisen,
according to Honors College
Dean G. Alec Stewart. “Carrie
retains exactly those qualities that
are prized for the Marshall,” he
said. “She has scope, drive and a
surpassing curiosity that tran-
scends mere intelligence to yield
the highest levels of personal at-
tainment.”

Theisen said it was Stewart
who approached her about ap-
plying for a Marshall, when she
was a Brackenridge Research
Fellow here last summer. “I had
heard about Marshalls and
Rhodes scholarships,” Theisen
said, “but I thought they were

"more about the study of politic_s,
.. and that’s*n=_ot what I work on.”

Theisen said shenever would
have won a Marshall without help
from Honors College personnel

and her faculty adviser, Charles

Perfetti of psychology and lin-

guistics. .- .
“Everybody at the Honors
College was encouraging and
extremely helpful. I’m really,
really busy and it was hard for
me to ﬁnd the time to complete
all of the application require-

ments,” said Theisen.

  ew policy restricts use of Trees pools
by spouses and children of Pitt faculty

itt’s vice provost for
Faculty Affairs is
seeking“furtherclari—

ﬁcation” of a policy change that
bars faculty members’ spouses
and children from using the
Trees Hall swimming pools ex-
cept as part of supervised com-
munity ﬁtness programs.
Before this fall, the pools had
been open —— ofﬁcially, if not
always in practice —— to faculty
spouses and as many as two chil-

" dren per faculty member, 6:30-

9:30 p.m. Mondays through Fri-
days and noon-4 p.m. on week-
ends.

Vice Provost Andrew R. Blair
said: “Basically, I’m trying to
clarify what the faculty’s family
privileges are at the Trees pools,
and how this new policy came
about.” Blair said he will pass
along his ﬁndings to economics

professor Herbert Chesler, who .

co-chairs the University Senate
beneﬁts and welfare committee.
Chesler asked Blair to inves-
tigate the policy change after
learning about it during the Nov.
27 Faculty Assembly meeting
from fellow Assembly member
Marilyn L. Ross, Pitt co-direc-
tor of Intramurals and Recre-
ation.
“Without further study, I
don’t want to say that the new
policy is unreasonable,” Chesler
said after the meeting. “Butl feel
very strongly that the Senate
must insist that any change which
denies to the faculty and their

spouses a beneﬁt or privilege that
they had been enjoying has to go
through the proper channels of
review, including the governance
system of the Senate.

“Such a change should not be
made by administrative ﬁat, as
this one apparently was.”

Ross emphasized that
Intramurals and Recreation has
not entirely barred employees’
family members from Trees Hall
pools: For fees of $48 or less per
term, they may participate in a
variety of supervised programs,
including swimming, scuba and
kinderkinetics.

“VVhat we can ’t have anymore
are spouses and children run-
ning around Trees Hall without
supervision, using what is essen-
tially a student facility as a family
play area,” Ross said. “The pools
are just too crowded these days
with athletic team practices and
a greatly expanded number of
student recreation and commu-
nity programs.”

Under the old policy, which
dated back at least to the 19603,
spouses and children accompa-
nied by faculty could use the
Trees pools during certain
posted hours. But in practice,
Ross said, faculty often would
beg off accompanying their fam-
ily members — who, after being
allowed into Trees Hall to use
the pool, would sometimes com-

by  etc with students for time on

"’”’ s = i 1 

and weightlifting equipment.

Pitt Risk Management staff
pointed out that the University
could be liable for injuries suf-
fered by family members using
Trees Hall without supervision,
Ross added.

“The University’s policy is
that [employees’] spouses and
children are not allowed to use
any athletic facility at Pitt, ex-
cept for certain supervised rec-
reation programs,” she said.

The policy that allowed fam-
ily members free use of the Trees
pools was a carryover from a
time when Pitt facilities were far
less busy, according to Ross.

Chesler did not dispute that.
But he insisted, “To institute a
change like this, you need to go
through proper channels and
convince people that the change
is necessary. The burden of proof
is on the administration.”

Chesler credited Vice Pro-
vost Blair with recently restor-
ing library borrowing privileges
and campus bus access to spouses
of Pittsburgh campus employ-
ees. The administration inad-
vertently cut off those privileges
last winter when it issued new
I.D. cards to staff and faculty. See
Nov. 8 University Times.

“Andy Blair was the one who
worked out the problem of the
I.D. cards. I’m hoping that he
will intercede in this [Trees pool]
issue, too, and that it will get
resolved without any interven-

currently can read online
through ULS’s web site.

G. Rush Miller noted that

the nonproﬁt library organiza-
tion OCLC has offered to buy
netLibrary’s assets. Whether the
purchase will go through is in
the hands of a U.S. bankruptcy
court.

“We’re very hopeful that the
purchase by OCLC will hap-
pen,” said Miller, who serves on
netLibrary’s advisory board.
“OCLC is verywell—funded, and
we have a lot of conﬁdence that
they can keep these online books
available to us, in addition to
developing a viable model for e-
books in the future.”

But whether or not OCLC
buys netLibrary’s assets, Pitt’s
contract with netLibrary speci-
ﬁes that if the company goes
under, ULS and its partners in a
state—wide libraries consortium
will receive digital copies of the
"8,000-some e-books they already
have acquired, Miller said. “We
would mount those digital cop-
ies on our server locally for our
constituents,” he explained.

“The only snag could be if
some publishers make a legal case
that their agreements with
netLibrary are in conflict with
the libraries’ agreements, and so
the libraries should not retain
perpetual access to certain

books,” Miller said.

“But I’m not too worried
about it,” he added.

ULS has spent about

$200,000 during the last several

years to acquire e-books through
netLibrary, Miller estimated.

Founded three years ago and
based in Boulder, Col.,
netLibrary “was once widely seen
as the most promising commer-
cial effort to offer e-books to
higher education,” The
Chronicle of Higher Education
pointed out. ,

“One thing that worries me,”
Miller said, “is that everybody
who has ventured into the e-
book arena has now been pretty
well bankrupted by it.

“I think the online book
model is not yet viable. Part of it
is that the public is not ready to
sit and read books cover—to-cover
on their computer screens.”

For that reason, most of the
e-books ULS purchased are ref-
erence works or how—to volumes,
books that people tend to read in
portions.

Since netLibrary’s ﬁnancial
problems reached the crisis stage,
the company has stopped send-
ing ULS updates on e—book use
by the Pitt community. Typi-

cally, though, the most popular‘

e-books in ULS’s collection
would be accessed 2 00-300 times
in a six-month period, Miller
said. '

“There’s no doubt that digi-
tal books have a major future,”
he insisted. “It’s just a matter of
what technology is used. Using a
portable e—book reader may be
more viable than sitting at a com-
puter, for example.” ,

Ol\I PUBLISHING/Robert Perloff

It’s not where, but what you

publish that should count

There is scarcely any task more important for senior faculty
to undertake than the evaluation of prospective new faculty and
of current, junior faculty for retention, promotion or tenure.
Maintaining high quality among the professoriate will ensure
the continuity of excellence in our tripartite mission of teaching,
research and service. Careful evaluations of these men and
women will enable us with conﬁdence and a high degree of
comfort to pass on the torch to our successors.

One of the criteria used for foraging through this sensitive
and essential, albeit sometimes tedious, procedure is to deter-
mine the quality of a person’s publications. Very frequently,
however, a surrogate for a thorough and judicious reading of a
person’s articles is the prestige of the journal in which the article
is published. Articles in “A” journals are given greater weight in
the evaluation process than those published in “B” or “C”
journals. This deference to journal elitism is brought about by
the time it takes to navigate through several articles as well as, in
many cases, the absence of the necessary competence and knowl-
edge on the part of the evaluators of a candidate’s particular ﬁeld;
hence a reliance, very often, on the where, and not on the what.
And more’s the pity, because who among us has not seen that
many heavily cited articles originally appeared in schlock jour-
nals and that many prosaic articles have been accepted for
publication by high—proﬁle journals? '

My purpose here is to propose procedures for ameliorating
this problematic state of affairs. The ﬁrst suggestion for correct-
ing the situation — whereby correcting I mean instituting the
fairer and more relevant practice of placing appropriate weight
on the article’s content per se rather, oftentimes speciously, than
on the journal in which the article appears —— is one that, frankly,
I have little expectation of adoption. I mention it, however,
because hope springs eternal and I must confess to being some-
what of a Don Quixote. Department heads, deans. and others
should be encouraged to reward professors who read articles,
word for word, idea for idea, by giving these readers some kind
of credit, say a modest reduction in course load for every 25 or
so articles they read in their entirety, read carefully, cogitate over
adequately and evaluate judiciously. Another form of payment

might be, for‘ public service or service to the profession to
professors who readtheir assigned quota of articles.

These suggestions inade, however, I must say that the incen-
tive that probably would have the greatest impact on inducing
professors to read and evaluate these articles is cash, cold cash.

Now where would this cash come from? Since the reading of
these articles is in effect a cost of doing our business, the money
needed to award cash payments ‘should be built into the
department’s or school’s budget. Perhaps the candidate might be
required to contribute to this kitty. Examples abound — licenses,
examination fees, etc. -- for asking an individual to contribute to
the costs of executing a decision that he or she is seeking to
achieve, a decision in the afﬁrmative resulting in an improve-
ment in the person’s status, quality of life, prestige, sense of
achievement, or what have you.

The crux of my contention is that in order to turn things
around and to remove the frequently unfair and incorrect prac-
tice of judging a person’s work by the elitism of the journal rather
than by the intrinsic merit of his or her piece of work, an
incentive must be in place for professors to faithfully and ad-
equately read the candidate’s work. There must be other incen-
tives than those proposed here. ~ »
Too many good people are punished by the injudiciou

practice of weighing one’s work by the journal in which it’ ‘

appears and probably, as-well, many less worthy candidates are
hired or elevated because of the flawed practice of worshipping
at the throne of journal celebrity. It’s high time for this unsatis-
factory situation to be corrected. We owe it to ourselves, to our
disciplines, to our professions, to the University and to our
students to judge a person’s work not bywhere he or she publishes
but, rather, by what he or she publishes. V I

CGS launches workforce initiative

itt’s College of Gen-

er_al Studies (CGS)

this week announced

a series of new certiﬁcate pro-

grams designed to _enhance con-

tinuing education opportunities
for the region’s workforce.

Called the Pitt Learning So-

lutions program, the initiative

focuses on ﬁve “regional growth

industry sectors” critical to the

economy: health care, manufac— .

turing, information technology,
ﬁnancial services, andhospital—
ity and tourism.

According to CGS Dean Su-
san R. Kinsey, Pitt Leaning So-
lutions represents a coordinated
response to the specialized edu-
cational needs of industries, or-
ganizations and workers in
southwestern Pennsylvania.

“Until now, we have largely
focused our attention on serving
the needs of degree students,”
Kinsey said. “With the launch of
the Pitt Learning Solutions, we
are expanding our reach to in-

clude non-degree continuing
education needs of working
people. Today’ s skilled workers
and professionals must continue
to update and retool their skills
and knowledge, not every few
years as before, but almost con-
stantly.” _

The certiﬁcates include both
credit and non-credit programs.
Beginning injanuary, CGS will
offer certiﬁcates in information
systems design (18 credits) and
accounting (22 credits). Non-
credit offerings include business
software, database development,
e—commerce management, web

master/ web author and web mas-

ter/web developer certiﬁcates.

Certiﬁcate programs in de-
velopment for fall 2002 include
health services program and
project management, geographic
information systems, engineer-
ing management, and corporate
communications. Other certiﬁ-
cates are planned for 2003,
Kinsey said. '

She added that the programs
will be offered at Pitt, on site at
area companies and, where ap-
propriate, on—line.

Faculty in information sci-
ences, engineering, business and
arts and sciences, as well as busi-

ness professionals will partici-

pate, with the College of Gen-
eral Studies as the administra-

. tive point-of-entry.

At a Dec. 5 press conference
announcing the new certiﬁcate
series Pitt Chancellor Mark A.
Nordenberg said that “CGS was
uniquely positioned to meet the
needs of employees who want
specialized programs. Often this
specialized education must be
acquired within time constraints
that are not compatible with tra-
ditional degree programs. That’s
where certiﬁcate programs, spe-
ciﬁcally crafted to meet this con-
stant need for enhanced and con-
tinuing education, become an
invaluable option for both em-
ployees and employers.”

  

Katz Participation Team (KPT)
since its inception in 1987. KPT
is a group of Katz school em-
ployees who meet voluntarily to
discuss work problems, analyze
causes and recommend solutions,
as well as implement activities
for the enjoyment of fellow em-
ployees.

According to the staff award
selection committee, KPT has
recommended several actions
that resulted in increased efﬁ-
ciency at the Katz school.

An avid bird—lover and na-
ture enthusiast,]onnet is a mem-
ber of several community orga-
nizations, including the Greater
Pittsburgh Cage Bird Society,
the Erie Cage Bird Society, the
Greater Pittsburgh Cactus and
Succulent Society and the
Greater Pittsburgh Water Gar-
den Society. She has established
an adoption program for un-
wanted cage birds.

Losagio serves as the admin-
istrative assistant to the French
and Italian department’s chair-
person.

The selection committee
cited Losagio as “a family mem-
ber away from home for the
department’s graduate students.”
Her volunteer positions include
adviser to the Italian Club and
secretary/ treasurer for the Ital-
ian Nationality Room commit-
tee, where she is active in raising
scholarship money.

She has served as a United
Way representative for 11 years
and is active with her
community’s Cub Scouts.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

increasing numbers of students
with serious mental health issues

ollege counseling cen-

ters nationwide report

a signiﬁcant increase

in the number of students with

severe mental health problems,
and Pitt is no exception.

The trend is documented in
an annual survey of counseling
center directors conducted by
Robert P. Gallagher, associate
clinical professor in administra-
tive and policy studies at Pitt’s
School of Education.

The rate of counseling cen-
ters reporting an increase of cli-
ents with severe problems has
been growing steadily since he
first asked the question on the
1990 survey, Gallagher said.
“The rate in 1990 of 50 percent
has grown to 85 percent this past
year of counselors reporting an
increase over the prior ﬁve years
of clients with severe problems.
This puts a lot of pressure on
counseling center staffs.”

Among the severe psycho-
logical problems suffered by
counseling centers’ clientele are
on-campus sexual assault con-
cerns, problems related to prior
sexual abuse, learning disabili-
ties, alcohol and drug abuse, self-
injury and eating disorders.

Since 1981, Gallagher has
authored the annual “National

Survey of Gounselftng Center«Di-.

rectors,” a publication of the
International Association of
Counseling Services, Inc. The
survey, which measures trends
in counseling centers, polled 2 74
counseling center directors, in-
cluding 91 from colleges such as
Pitt with more than 15,000 stu-
dents. -

Gallagher headed Students
Affairs from 1996 to 2000. Prior
to that, he headed Pitt’s Coun-
seling Center for more than 25
years. He now works in the Uni-
versity Counseling Center one
day a week as an adviser to coun—
seling interns.

“I think the increase in severe
problems is due to a combina-
tion of a number of factors,”
Gallagher said. “One, colleges
are much more open now with
respect to enrollment. Two, stu-
dents are accepted who are al-
ready on medication or have been
in counseling and expect that to
be continued. Three, colleges
really are becoming a referral
place; mental health profession-
als want to put clients in a uni-
versity setting where they can
get support, maybe to get them
out of a bad family situation. We
pick up a lot that way.”

Penny Crary, who succeeded
Gallagher as director of Pitt’s
Counseling Center, said the in-
crease in severe problems is a
concern for her as well. “I would
say lack of the proper parental
attention that children need is a
big factor in the increase of men-
tal health problems of all kinds,
particularly severe ones. There
is also a lack of referral services,
and, certainly, the diminished
community mental health re-

sources are factors that put pres-
sure on college counseling cen-
ters.

“I would describe our
caseload at present as manage-
able,” she said. “But one of the
problems with the increase in
clients generally is that it limits
our other programs. The Coun-
seling Center is responsible for
outreach to the University com-
munity, for making presentations
and workshops. And, unfortu-
nately, we just don’t get to do as
much preventive work of that
kind as we would like.”

Stafﬁng shortages also are a
concern, Crary said. “Even
though we were able to increase
our staff by one, two years ago,
the demand for services has in-
creased at a rate greater than the
number of staff we’ve been able
to hire.”

Currently, Pitt’s center has

12 full—time counseling staff, one
part-time consulting psychiatrist

‘and four full-time predoctoral

interns, Crary said. The student
to counselor ratio is 1 to every
2,180 students, which, accord-
ing to the survey, is slightly bet-
ter than the average school of
15,000 or more students (1 for
every 2,239 students).

“On the other hand, I know
we can’t just be expecting to in-
crease staff all the time,” Crary
said. She said that to cope with



has adopted some strategies.‘One
is to have a 12—session per stu—
dent annual limit, with some ﬂex-
ibility depending on the case.

According to Gallagher’s sur-
vey, 44 percent of centers limit
client sessions per student and
an additional 38 percent encour-
age such limits. The average
number of sessions per client is
5.2 nationwide.

Another strategy at Pitt,
Crary said, is to spread out the
time between sessions for less
severe problems.

A third strategy is to urge
clients to join group therapy ses-
sions focused on common prob-
lems, such as relationships, be-
reavement and family issues.

“Although it is not popular,
we really try to promote a group
therapy culture, where it is ap-
propriate,” Crary said. ”Who
better to talk with about rela-
tionship problems than men and
women who have similar prob-

leins? You know, people often.

have the wrong idea about group
therapy, that it’s people scream-
ing at each other, or it’s like the
‘Bob Newhart Show’ with crazies
everywhere. Usually, after a few
individual counseling sessions,
we can break down those stereo-
types and clients see the beneﬁt
in trying group therapy.”

Both Gallagher and Crary
stressed that a high percentage
of clients at Pitt and nationwide
— as many as 80 percent,
Gallagher estimated —— are nor-
mal people with normal prob-
lems, such as self—identity issues,
homesickness, roommate dis-
agreements, relationship break-
ups, test anxiety, stress.

“The top three reasons cli-
ents come in [at Pitt] are depres-
sion, anxiety and relationships,”

Crary said, all of which can be

severe, but most of which are

‘ 1101:.

“At. Pitt, counseling started
with services that were primarily
career development services,
which is typical,” Gallagher said.
“Now the situation is reversed:
7 5 percent of work at counseling
centers nationwide deals with
psychological problems, only 2 5
percent career problems. Career

° 60 percent of centers had at
least one case of an obsessive
pursuer (3 47 cases in all; 50 per-
sons were injured and’5 were
killed).

Other major concerns of
counseling center directors in-
clude the growing demand for
services with'no increase in re-
sources or reduced resources
(62.7 percent), and the need to

services are moving over into
specialized placement services.
And while, for example here at
Pitt [admissions] standards are
increasing, psychological prob-
lems are really not related to
intellectual capacity. »

“There’s also more accep-
tance generally to counseling,”
Gallagher continued. “Over the
last several years there is a grow-
ing awareness of the importance
of these services. There is less of
a stigma to talking with a coun—
selor. Ifyou go back2 5 years you
rarely heard about sexual abuse,
for example. And at one time,
you would never share that —
anywhere‘ with anyone. Now
there are TV shows and psy-
chology classes.”

According to the survey, stu-

students who need long—term
help (59 percent).

“At one time it was easier for
counseling centers to refer stu-

vention to community mental
health centers, but these pro-
grams are bursting at the seams,”
Gallagher said. “If a student

comes in from out—of—state or

dents with from another country and

uring his 25 years as
head of Pitt’s student
counseling services,
Robert P. Gallagher, associate
clinical professor at Pitt’s School
of Education, has witnessed the
gamut of problems facing stu-
dents. His recent research indi-
cates that more instances of seri-
ous mental health problems have
surfaced in counseling centers
across the nation, forcing coun-
selors to adjust to greater
caseloads and various legal situ-
ations.

Here Gallagher discusses
some of the counseling strate-
gies he has employed and his
thoughts on today’s student
counseling ﬁeld.

Should counselors draw on
their own experiences and share
those with clients?

“Over time, counseling phi-
losophies have gone between

-extremes: 2 5-30 years ago there

were group love-ins as therapy.
It was all about touching and
sharing feelings. Then, 10-15
years ago, it moved to the other
extreme ofkeepingyour distance
entirely. Now it’s somewhere in
the middle, although it varies

among counselors.

“Typically, I  try to stay
removed from clients, to keep
the focus on their issues. But
there are times when the paral-
lels are so close, you share some
of that, and that’s perfectly ethi-
cal.

“I think you can go too far
with removing yourself. I re-
member hearing a counselor
once say, ‘Today, I did a terrible
thing: A client asked me a direct
question  and I answered it!’
There is a danger in increasing
that distance: It’s like saying a
hug is a terrible thing. Well, in a
wrap-up session, a student—initi-
ated hug is ﬁne and appropriate.

“There are lots of ways of
showing your humanity without
revealing all of your personal 1
side.”

PVhat a counselor hecomes
physically attracted to a client?

, “There are physicality issues.
Using the counselor/ client rela-
tionship to take advantage is
strictly unethical. The reason
most people who lose their li-
cense do is because of that. But
research in the last 10 years has
found that most counselors feel
some attraction to some client at
some point. They wouldn’t be

human otherwise.

“The point is a very small
percentage of counselors act out
because of that. The vast major-
ity can handle that, especially
since most counseling is short
term. But now admitting an at-
traction is more common, talk-
ing about it with colleagues. Our
training programs discuss it. It
comes up all the time.”

And what ahout the reverse
situation, where a client is at-
tracted to a counselor, so-called
“transference” in the parlance
of therapy? '

“Sure, transference is very

‘common. A number" of thera-
pists believe that has to happen
to be successful.‘That’s true more
in long—term situations. But for
the number of us working on
short-term counseling some-
times transference is a negative
thing. You need to discourage it;
it can be hard to break.”

The Counseling Center pro-
motional materials stress client
conﬁdentiality. Are there excep-

tiality?

client/counselor relationship.
Parents will call and ask what’s
going on with their child. There
is some delicacy to working
around that kind of issue.

“Legally, if a student is a dan-
ger to him— or herself or to oth-
ers, the counselor is required to
take action. You have the re-
sponsibility to break conﬁdenti-
ality and give a warning to the
threatened person or persons. In
Pennsylvania, you’re not re-
quired to protect them, but you
must warn them.

“VVhen you’re convinced a
student will harm himself or her-
self, and that student refuses to
be hospitalized, your duty is to
get a judge’s permission to hos-
pitalize the student against their
will. Here, we commit students
to Western Psych. They can re-
strain a student there for 72 hours
for evaluation and, if necessary,
get another judicial hearing to
extend that time. It provides pro-
tection to a person in danger.

“There are some gray areas.
In the case of child abuse, the law
is quite difficult. If the student is
the abuser, and it’s not ongoing,
there’s no legal obligation to re-
port that. I would ﬁrst ask, How
long ago did this happen? Is it
likely it will happen again?. Can
we work on this issue? That al-
lows counselors some ﬂexibility.

“Usually, once you’ve gone
outside conﬁdentiality, you can’t
be treating the person afterwards.
If you inform a third-party part-

 

tive, for example, your client
won’t want to see you anymore.
And they won’t tell the next
counselor they see about it ei-
ther. It’s preferable to convince

A the client to tell the partner.”

,Alcohol and drug abuse
among college. students is re-
portedly on the rise. Are these

commonplace issues for a coun-

selor?

“Rarely do students come in
and say they have an alcohol
problem. And the negative physi-
cal consequences of that prob-
lem don’t usuallyappear until
later.

“But if they get into trouble;
they get into ﬁghts; their grades
go down; they’re falling apart;
they seek counseling because
their life is a mess or they feel
trapped: In those cases, once you
establish a rapport with a client,
you can point out the relation-
ship between alcohol and behav-
ior. Only then can you have a
real impact on that problem.

“We try not to become judg-
mental about those types of be-
haviors, like pot smoking or ex-
cessive drinking. The point is to
look at it in terms of whether
they are unhappy, and what is
contributing to that. Can you
show them evidence that it’s
impacting negatively on their
lives, and whether these things
are part of what might be worked
on in counseling?

“Much of the work we do at
counseling centers is to help
people be independent and make
healthy decisions for themselves,
to guide them through that pro-
cess. There’s a commonality of
that approach no matter what
the problem is.”

1 ‘,9£§p‘0Si:.-:-r1-.-

Sbould counselors advocate

or proselytize a particular set of

religious or political beliefs?

“I think that’s a mistake. It’s
one thing to say to a client,
‘You’re struggling with spiritu-
ality issues and maybe pastoral
counseling is better for you at
this time.’ But trying to draw
someone into your own particu-
lar belief system by saying, for
example, you need to turn your-
self over to God. These are ‘dan-
gerous waters.

“There may be political is—i

sues, too: choice versus the right
to life issue, for example. People
are usually on one side of the
fence or the other. As a counse-

lor you have to keep your own F

biases out of it. You say that to
the client up front: ‘What’s im-
portant here is for you to arrive
at a decision that is right for
you.’ '

“You can’t push your own
beliefs. It’s much better to refer

_ them to someone else. You may

even have a client who rubs you
the wrong way, touches a nerve
in a way you can’t deal with. I can
see a counselor becoming very
upset, for example, if a client
says that the U.S. deserved what
they got on Sept. 11. That the
client hoped there’ll be more
attacks. Not all counselors, but
some would be unable to coun-

-sel that client. For you to accept

as a client everyone who comes
through the door, that would be
difficult.”

"3ls¥.dQ-tb03e_,>_;«.

and subsequent events present
new issues for counselors?

“Yes, it’s new turf. Counse-
lors themselves are impacted by
it, trying to make sense of it. And
part of the message is: We’re all
in this.

“People likely to seek coun-
seling are those for whom this

has kicked in hard —-they’re not‘

sleeping, they’re depressed, they
feel extreme anger, they feel in
danger. To the extent that it’s an:
irrational fear, you can look back
to your counseling "skills and
work on the irrational part.
Those who go into a deep de-
pression, I think, might already
have some deep—seated issues.
But post-traumatic stress is a real
thing. Our expectations are that
more people will seek counsel-
ing as time goes on.”

(Gallagher said that last
month he did a limited survey of
20 counseling center directors
related to the aftermath of the
events of Sept. 11 and their ef-
fects on counseling center
caseloads. See related story be-
ginning on page 4.)

“Only one school reported
that 9/11 did not appear to im-
pact on their caseload. All. of the
others indicated that there had
been a marked increase in the
number of students seeking ser-
vice as compared to this time last
year. Most were up between 30
and 60 percent. Most also re-

_ ported that crisis counseling and

after-hours calls were particu-
larly high.

- “The responding schools that
were closest to New York expe-
rienced the most direct linkage
between 9/ 11 and the kinds of
problems they were seeing. Stu-

dents reported anxiety attacks,
nightmares, fears of further at-
tacks, fears of anthrax, fears of
going through tunnels, or over
bridges or riding on subways.
Many had a great deal of diffi-
culty concentrating.

“Most of the schools that were
farther away from Ground Zero
reported that some clients saw a
direct connection between their
problems and the terrorist at-
tacks. They were fearful of at-
tending large classes or going to
large public events.

“These students, however,
did not account for the huge
increase in caseloads. Many stu-
dents came into centers with a
wide array of developmental con-
cerns, but there was also a large
increase in students with anxiety
attacks with no known precipi-
tating events, with depression,
sleeplessness, and concerns about

their futures.

“It was the conclusion of most
responding directors that 9/ 11
‘lowered the threshold’ for stu-
dents who were struggling with
other problems. One director

p spoke of a ‘psychological fault

line’ that may be present in frag-
ile students.

“I think that it is not only
fragile students that have such a
fault line. All of us are capable of
developing stress reactions if the

cumulative pressures in our lives
are great enough.

“The terrorist attack seems
to have precipitated or exacer-
bated dormant symptoms. While
students were able to function
reasonably well in spite of their
personal issues prior to this time,
the emotionally charged atmo-
sphere that developed after 9/1 1
seems to have made it more dif-
ﬁcult to ignore these problems.”

Commitment to clinic

was not in anyone’s interest, in-
cluding those who share our de-
sire to make the clinic a strong
part of the educational program
here at the University.”
Holland retorted: “It would
not have become a public issue if
it had been handled properly. It
only became a public issue be-
cause we seem to be buckling to
outside interference in academic
matters. That is why it’s a public
issue. It’s not because the news-

» papers made it one, it’s because

they are reporting what’s hap-
pening.”

Provost Maher said the clinic
controversy has raised “impor-
tant academic issues that we all
care about. But when you pick
your medium for discussion, you
pick a style and a process that
may or may not provide for the
best and most illuminating dis-
cussion. I think the public media
are a particularly poor forum for

acad 

issues are at all complicated and
subtle.”
Like Dean Herring, Maher

argued that the Universityis only
following the examples of other
public universities in seeking to
establish its Environmental Law
Clinic as a separate, non—proﬁt
entity that will be insulated from
legislative retribution.

“The chancellor and I have
been bending over backward
throughout the discussion [of the
clinic’s future] to avoid taking
over the prerogatives or the roles
of the School of Law and its
faculty,” Maher said.

In an interview, Herring said
negotiations to spin off the clinic
as a separate organization are
coming along, but slowly. “In
principle, we know where we
want to go,” he said. “But as far
as the details of the financial ar-
rangements, the physical space,
that stuff takes time to draw to-
gether. The plan is that the clinic

office will be located outside the
law school building, but as close

UNIVERSITY TIMES

itt could raise tuition

next fall by 10-15

percent — or even
more —- and still recruit a fresh-
man class equal to this year’s in
terms of academic quality, di-
versity and sheer numbers.

But only public colleges and
universities nationwide raised
their tuitions by about the same
percentage.

Betsy Porter, director of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid for
the Pittsburgh campus, offered
that assessment at a recent meet-
ing of the University Senate’s
budget policies committee
(BPC).

“On the other hand, it would
be hard to increase the Univer-
sity ofPittsburgh’s tuition by 10
percent if Penn State increased
its tuition by 2.5 percent,” she
added. “That would be hard po-
litically and it would be hard to
sell to the public.”

Pitt’s tuition increase of 7.5
percent this fall was the largest
here in 13 years, and more than
double the Consumer Price In-
dex inflation rate.

But Pitt’s hike was slightly
lower percentage-wise, though
not in dollars, than this year’s
national average of tuition in-
creases (7.7 percent) among pub-
lic colleges and universities.

State budget cuts andstingy
appropriations for higher edu-
cation were blamed for hefty tu-
ition hikes across the country,
including in Pennsylvania. State
lawmakers increased Pitt’s ap-
propriation by just 0.6 percent
this year, compared with annual
increases of 3-4 percent durin
mbsf Of the la'St”déCﬁd't'§.” ‘”“  ’

Porter repeated Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg’s recent
warning that Pitt’s state appro-
priation for next year may fall

well short of the $186.1 million
the University has requested.
Based on that request, which
would be 4.3 percent more than
Pitt’s current base appropriation,
the University administration
pledged to limit next fall’s tu-
ition increase for in—state under-
graduates to 4 percent.

“Even before Sept. 1 I,” Por-
ter said, “there were signs that
Pennsylvania was backing away
from [funding increases for]
state-related institutions and
even the state—owned universi-
ties. But given the Sept. 1 1 back-
drop and other, higher priority
issues that will utilize state re-
sources, we can expect to have
some pretty difficult years

ahead.”

A "very strong
position" in the
marketplace

Fortunately, Pitt enjoys “a
very strong position” in the
higher education marketplace,
according to Porter.

“The fact is that, for a Penn-
sylvania student, our tuition for
a research university is very rea-
sonable when compared to tu-
ition rates at other institutions
with which we compete,” Porter
argued. See St01’_'y on page 7. Of
Pitt’s current freshmen, 83 per-
cent are from Pennsylvania.

Recruiting students from out-
side Pennsylvania could become
problematic, however, if high
tuition increases continue here,
Porter cautioned.

For one thing, Pitt out-of-
state students don’t qualify for

PHEAA grants from Pennsylva-
nia and can’t bring similar grants
to Pitt from their home states,
limiting their main aid sources
to federal loans and grants and
Pitt grants and scholarships.

Among the nine universities
that Pitt considers to be its major
competitors, three — the Uni-
versity of Delaware, the Univer-
sity of Maryland and Virginia
Tech —— charge lower out-of-
state tuition than Pitt does. So
do public universities in other
states where Pitt has begun re-
cruiting.

Add up Pitt’s annual out-of-
state tuition for College of Arts
and Sciences students ($15,100
currently), room and board, fees,
book and transportation costs
and miscellaneous expenses, and

i a typical non-Pennsylvanian re-
ceiving no ﬁnancial aid would
have to spend about $100,000 to
attend Pitt for four years.

A growing
financial aid
budget

Porter complained that news

‘ media reports of Pitt’s 7.5 per-
cent tuition hike this fall tended
to overlook the fact that the
University increased its ﬁnan-
cial aid budget by the same per-
centage.

Thanks to this year’s increases
of $350 in the maximum state
PHEAA grant and $100 in the
maximum federal Pell grant,
Pennsylvanians who qualify as
“full—need” students at Pitt are
receiving an additional $450 in
aid this year, more than enough

to cover the University’s 7.5 per-
cent tuition hike even without
additional aid from Pitt, said
Porter.

Pitt has increased its budget
for grants and scholarships at a
rate higher than the national av-
erage —— from $14.4 million dur-
ing the 1998-99 academic year
to a projected $20.6 million this
year.

“This has all been to fund a
fairly aggressive, academic merit-
based scholarship program,
which has now reached its peak,”
Porter said. Pitt now is enrolling
“signiﬁcant numbers” of students
whose family incomes are high
enough that they can afford to
attend Pitt without scholarship
aid, she said.

“We’ve reached the end of
the line in increasing scholar-
ship resources to improve the
quality of the class. Now what

we have to do is take advantage
of our name recognition, our
institutional quality and begin to
attract students who are willing
to pay the full price.

“Even though there has been
a signiﬁcant increase in dollars
to support merit—based scholar-
ships,” Porter pointed out, “the
vast majority of the institutional
money that we provide is based
on need” —$5 7 million this year.

Students whose family in-
comes exceed government “dem—
onstrated ﬁnancial need” limits,
but who still need ﬁnancial help,
can beneﬁt from a new type of
federal loan: unsubsidized
Stafford student loans.

Under the regular Stafford
loans program, qualiﬁed students
can borrow up to $2 ,62 5 for their
freshman year, $3,500 as sopho-
mores and $5,500 per year as
juniors, seniors and ﬁfth-year

CIDDE

undergraduates. ‘

“Even with that, there’s

sometimes a gap ‘between what
families can pay and the student’s
total bill,” Porter said. ‘.‘To help
meet that need, the government
has created the unsubsidized
Stafford loan program. Repay-
ment is only on the interest, not
the principal, until after gradua-
tion.” —

Loans have played an increas-
ing part in Pitt’s ﬁnancial aid
system over the last 20 years, as
they have nationally. Federal
loans now represent 5 5 percent
of all available student aid na-
tionally, and 52 percent of aid
provided through Pitt, Porter
said.

A demographic
"sweet spot"

Demographically, Pitt is in
“a sweet spot,” Porter said.
“There are more kids going to
college, more kids graduating
from high school.”

One demographic trend that
may not continue much longer is
the disproportionately high
number of female undergradu-
ates. Fifty-ﬁve percent of Pitt’s
fall 2001 freshmen are women,
about the national average.

Porter explained: “There
have been more female students
going to college because many
male students, even some of the
better students, were being si-
phoned off by the dot—com ﬁrms
that offered very attractive start-
ing salaries even to high school
graduates.”

he list of universities

I with which the Pitts-
» _ burgh campus com-
petes for undergraduates has
grown more exclusive since the
mid-1990s, as Pitt has raised its
admissions standards and broad-
ened its recruiting.

Pitt no longer, sees West Vir-
ginia University and Pennsyl-
vania’s “state-owned schools as
competitors, and it now consid-

ers Carnegie Mellon and-
»Duquesne4 to be its only local

competitors.

New to Pitt’s competitors list
are Boston, George Washing-
ton, New York and,Virginia
Tech universities.  __ ’_

The University’s’ primary

out-of-state recruiting markets A

. are Maryland, N ewjersey, New

York, Virginia and the District
of Columbia — where Pitt ben-
eﬁts fromstrong alumni support
and past recruiting successes, and
where many students see
Pittsburgh’s urban campus as a

— ‘plus, according to Oakland Ad-3

missions and Financial Aid di-
rectorB'etsy Porter.’ _

h For many bright (but not
quite top-notch) high school
graduates in Pennsylvania and
West Virginia, state-owned uni-
versitiesare a betterbuy than
Pitt becausethose schools offer

lower in-state tuition and better

ﬁnancial aid packages, Porter

“Slippery Rock or IUP [Indi-

she said.” “We?re going to let
those students go because they
don’t meet our standards for a
full ride.” , _’ V

‘But this is the ﬁrst year in a

decade that Pitt hasn’t had a re-

cruiting program in Charleston,
1' West Virginia’s main source of
graduating seniors.

‘ “We just can’t draw out of
West Virginia,” Porter said.
“Tuition at WVU and all of the
state schools in West Virginia is
much lower than ours. Also,
we’re interested in high—quality
students, and in West Virginia
they’re siphoned off by WVU
with offers of ‘full packages” of
tuition plus roomband board.

Pitt has begun recruiting in
Florida, Illinois and Massachu-
setts, wherestrong Pitt Clubs of
alumni have been .“ enormously
helpful,” Porter said. “'We’re
getting good students from those
states. Not alot of students, but
the kind of high—quality students
we want.” ' 

Suburban Detroit is another
market Pitt is trying to tap, hop-

ing to attract students who pre- 1

fer a_ big—city campus.
“Ohio has always been a very
- difﬁcult market" for us,” Porter
noted. “As close as it is, it’s difﬁ—
cult because the Ohio State sys-
S tem is so ‘strong. Even trying to
get a student from Steubenville

’ or Youngstown is difﬁcult, but

...we keep trying.” e e

said. 9 L  V .
Out-of-state students who
come" to Pittsburgh to visit
Carnegie Mellon oftenevisit Pitt
‘ as well, just as Pitt’s out-of-state
recruits often visit CMU while
they’re in town, said Porter.

  As standards here go up, the list  
  of Pitt’s competitors is changing  

“Bringing more out-of-state stu-
dents to Pennsylvania, to Pitts-

burgh, is good for all of us,” she

said."

For that reason, Pitt recently
proposed launching joint Pitt-
CMU recruiting programs in
other states. So -far,4 Carnegie
Mellon hasn’t taken Pitt up on
the suggestion, Porter said. _

Despite its recent recruiting
success, Pitt still loses good stu-
dents to competing universities,
she acknowledged. But‘Admis—
sions and Financial Aid staff don’t
worry as long as students reject
Pitt for the right reasons ——- be-
cause they prefer a rural univer-
sity, for example, or a small, pri—
vate one.

“It ,doesn’t bother me when ,

they decide they’re going to go

to Penn State instead of Pitt,” _

Porter said, “because, on aver-

age, we win more than we lose
when we go head—to—head with
Penn State,” where tuition is sev-
eral hundred dollars higher than
at Pitt, and little Happy Valley,

burgh.

But Porter added: “It does
bother me when a student says;
‘I’m not coming to Pitt but I’m
goingto Ohio State instead.”

Financial Aid director Betsy Por-

ter how a move to private statusf

might affect Pitt enrollments.

Assuming thatthe move
would force Pitt to raise tuition
substantially, maybe even to

[double it, “I think wecould ex-

pect a major decline in enroll-
ment,” Porter replied.

The reverse happened in
1966, she noted,iwhen Pitt be,-

_came state—related and cut its

tuition from $1,450 to $450 a
year. “Pitt suddenly became in-

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
is studying whether tooffer those

Frank Colavita loves teaching,
especially large introductory classes.
A tenured associate professor and
former chair of the psychology de-
partment, he could avoid the much-__

     ‘

‘Colavita, a 1997 winner of the
Chancellor’s Distinguished Teach-
ing Award, not only is willing to
teach the “Introduction to Psychol-
ogy” class, which typically enrolls
hundreds of students, he insists on
It.

“I ’m an excitement junkie: I
skydive and I ride motorcycles. I was
a ranked runner in my age group
and I still run marathons and other
races, ” says Colavita, who turns 62
today, Dec. 6. “I like to challenge
myself And teaching these huge
classes and trying to keep everybody
awake, alert and interested is quite
challenging. ”

The New jersey native holds a
BA. in experimental psychology

from the University of Maryland
and a Ph.D. in psychology ﬁ*om
Indiana University atBlooming-ton.
His specialty is hiologicalpsychology,
although he teaches a wide range of
courses including this term ’s His-
tory of Psychology (40 students) and
a graduate student seminar (7 stu-
dents), in addition to intro to psych
(416 students).

Colavita joined the Pitt ﬁiculty
in 1966. He was named associate

professor in 1970, and in 1983 he
was appointed associate professor in
educational psychology at Pitt’s
School of Education. He served as
psychology department chair from
1980 to 1988.

Colavita defended the lecture
method in a roundtahle discussion
at last month ’s Provost’s Teaching
Excellence Fair and in a subsequent
interview with the University
Times. He also oﬂered advice for
those confronted with large lecture
courses.

and they’re wasting their time. I
also give students permission to
say something to a class mem-
ber, if they’re being distracted.
“But I never embarrass any-

who made the mistake of telling
a student that his question was

not ask any more questions, the
other students stopped asking

you didn’t have good coopera-

part, and I seem to get that. Does
that mean ‘I’ve won them over?
Yes, it does. But if you go in
there with the preconceived no-
tion that these are a bunch of
losers who couldn’t make it
where you went to school, that’s
going to come across.”
Colavita staunchly defends
the caliber of Pitt students.
“VVhen I hear my colleagues
say something about the low
quality of our students, I have to
say something. That’s not been
my experience. I ﬁnd that these
young people are so smart and so
respectful and so polite.”
Reﬂecting on his early years
of teaching, Colavita says he used
to micro-manage himself. “I’d
write everything out, and tape
record and time my lectures as
practice, and then critique them:
‘I need a little humor here. I
need to add an example there.’

and to move around. I prowl.

They expect that. I use a wireless_
mic. That’s the only concession
to technology I have. You get
me, the blackboard and-dustless
chalk.’’ ‘ .

This extemporaneous lectur-
ing style has other advantages,
Colavita maintains, including
spontaneity in his thought pro-
cess. “just [last week,] I was talk-
ing about a phenomenon, and I

suddenly remembered a ‘collo-

oto - ancla age I I

quium speaker that I heard years
ago. I remembered this talk I
heard, and I worked it right in. I
don’t feel like I ever get stale,
because every lecture is different
and you remember different
things. Or I may read something
in the newspaper and work that
in. And with 50 divisions of psy-
chology, there’s always new ma-
terial to cover.”

Colavita says those early days
of taping lectures for practice
paid off in the long run. “It was
almost like rehearsal, so that on
future occasions a lot of the ba-
sics would stick with me and the
preparation became easier. The
expression, ‘Fly now, pay later’
—- Well, I paid my dues first and
ﬂew later. That only reallyworks
on the basic stuff, like Pavlov,
because you still have to learn
the new stuff, but I never regret-
ted all that early work, because
for one thing it builds your con-
fidence.”

Colavita says his best lectures
focus on fewer topics in greater
depth with more examples-

“If you do a shotgun ap-
proach, they’re going to forget

90 percent of it. However, if you .

pick your issues carefully, almost
through overkill on the examples,
they’re much more likely to re-
member it.

“I go out of my way to use
more and more dramatic ex-
amples. It’s much more likely to
be coded into their memory.”

Colavita saidhe rarely ﬁelds ‘

questions duringa lecture. “Once
in a while if a hand goes up, I
might ask, ‘Is this going to be a
question on what I’m talking
about, and will the answer be
useful to everyone "in the class?’
Usually, I tell them, ‘This is not
a democracy; when I want inter-
action, I’ll ask for it.’ But I always
make myself available for stu-
dents before. and after class and
as much as possible at other
times.” .

Colavita came belatedly to the
teaching profession.

“In graduate school, I was
fairly sure that I was either going
to work at a research institute or
some NIH laboratory, and I was
teaching only because it was re-
quired as part of our graduate
program.

“The first course I taught, I
felt so nervoustand inadequate
the whole time I swore I’d never
go into teaching.

, “And. then‘ I started doing it
because, with three kids, Icould
use the extra money. And then‘I
started doing what you call cog-
nitive re—frarni_ng. Instead of call-
ing what I was feeling ‘anxiety,’ I
started to call it ‘excitement.’

“‘I’m excited!’ I’d lie to my-
self. Now, I truly get a lot of
excitement out of teaching, es-
pecially my large classes. There’s
a phenomenon in the behavioral

' sciences called the self—fulfilling

prophecy. Well, that’s an illus-
tration of it. i

“I don’t think there’s anyone
personality that makes a good
teacher. Different people are ef-
fective in different situations. In
a graduate seminar they’ll cut
you some slack. To be conﬁ-
dent, dynamic, energetic — these
are much more important with a
large group. I believe that I am
effective in a seminar, a small
class and a large class. But the
one that excites me the most is
the large one.” I

RESEARCH NOTES

Bioterrorism
research at
Pitt 8; CIVIU
receives grant
The BioMedical Security In-

. stitute (BMSI), a joint initiative

of Pitt’s Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health (GSPH) and Carnegie

~ Mellon University, has received
a $755,563 grant from the Cen-

ters for Disease Control and Pre-

_ vention (CDC) for research on

bioterrorism preparedness and
response. ‘
“Since the events of Septem-
ber ‘II, the relevance of
bioterrorism research has be-
come startlingly apparent, and
the work being conducted here

in Pittsburgh is of great impor-

tance to the national effort,” said
BMSI Director Samuel Watson
of GSPH. S

The recent CDC award pro-
vides BMSI with an additional
year of funding for continuation
of research projects that were

first funded by the CDC in Oc-

tober 2000, as well as several -

new areas,of research. Additional
funds have come from the

Agency for Healthcare Research

and Quality, and the Defense

. Advanced Projects Research

Agency. , .
‘Pitt research projects funded
through these grants include:

textual information and natural ,

language processing (Wendy
Chapman, Center for Biomedi-
cal Informatics), clinical event
monitoring (Fu-Chiang Tsui,
Center for Biomedical
Inforn1atics),‘trusted brokerfor
information‘ systems (Ravi

es'o H

(Lee Harrison,'GSPH and
School of Medicine). The

_ projects led by Chapman, Tsui

and Sharma are part of a larger
research effort to develop _a com-
puter—based surveillance system
to provide early detection and
warning of bioterror attacks.
BMSI and the bioterrorism
preparedness and response pro-

gram at GSPH are seeking one- _

page concept and proposal pa-
pers for submission to various

. federal, agencies.

BMSI was established in 2 000
with. a mission to advance the
nation’s capability to detect, ana-
lyze, prevent and respond -to

natural events and acts of terror-

ism involving biological agents.

Pitt study finds

new answers

to miscarriage
A genetic ﬂaw located in the

(X chromosome appears, to be a
key component of recurrent mis-
carriage among some women, 4

 
  

accordingto a new study.
"  :. rs r4n.=;..—..n .....a  ‘ In ~‘.
of Obstetricsand yne-
cology, physicians and scientists
at Pitt Health Sciences schools
and Magee-Womens Research
Institute found that an abnor-
mality in one of the mother’s
two X chromosomes may be at
work in causing repeated preg-
nancy loss. I
“This is exciting news for
women who have suffered re-
currentmiscarriageswith no idea
why,” said study authorW. Allen
Hogge, a professor of obstet-
rics, gynecology and reproduc-

tive sciences and an associate a

professor of human genetics at

‘ Pitt’s School of Medicine. “Un-

til now, even extensive testing

-has often been unable to pin-

point a cause._” Infact, upto half

~ of women who have had miscar-

riages could discover no medical

; explanation for their losses.

' Working with the Children’s
National Medical Center at
George Washington University,
the Pittsburgh team found that
the X-chromosome gene flaw is
detectable in the mother’s blood.
No health risks, however, have

been associated with this abnor— ‘

mality in the women themselves.
w These women, who are carri-
ers of X—linked recessive disor-

ders, are more likelyto miscarry ‘

male fetuses, said Hogge, calling
the ﬁnding “statistically signiﬁ-
cant.” i
The study of 105 patients re-
vealed that 14 percent of partici-
‘pants with previously unex-

plained recurrent miscarriages‘

had X—linked recessive lethal
traits, said Hogge, who is a clini-
cal iinvestigator at Magee-
Womens Research Institute and
medical director of genetics at

Magee-Womens Hospital of the
UPMC Health System.

Some 50 percent of male
pregnanciesireceive the mother’s
anomalous X chromosome, caus- 1
ing the fetus to spontaneously
abort. Female fetuses are less

' likely to be miscarried because

there are two. X chromosomes,
and they need only be linked to
one. Because of this, they have a
50-50 chance of avoiding the
faulty gene.

Though there is no known
cure for this genetic ﬂaw, the
availability of a blood test will be
a signiﬁcant improvement in risk
assessment for future pregnan-
cies, fertility and counseling,
Hogge said. -

In addition to Hogge, study
authors included Mark C. ‘
Lanasa, Carolyn Kubik,James
Harger and Tracy Posen, all of
the Pitt School_ of Medicine;
Roberta B. Ness of Pitt’s
Graduate _School of Public
Health; Nina Markovic of Pitt’s
School of Dental Medicine; Eric
Hoffman, Children’s National
Medical Center, and Theodore
Nagel, University ofMinnesota.

stitutes of Health and the NIH

I\Iew tumor
antigen, .
candidate for

. identified

The protein cyclin B 1, a
newly identiﬁed tumor antigen,
holds promise as a candidate for

iG3«D»-=wtlre=developmentofa cancer vac- —

cine, according to a Pitt study.
The new antigen’ will be used
in future cancer vaccine trials for
breast cancer, lung cancer and
head and neck cancer, said
Olivera Finn, co—author of the
study, professor of molecular

genetics and biochemistry at
Pitt’s School of Medicine _and
leader of the immunology pro-
gram at the University of Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute.

“We are very excited about
this discovery. Identifying new
tumor antigens that elicit strong
responses by the immune system
is imperative for the success of
tumor-specific immunother-
apy,” Finn said. “If we can use a
patient’s own immune system to
recognize and attack existing
cancer cells and prevent future
tumors from developing, we are
closer to ﬁnding a more effective
and less toxic treatment for can-
cer and to possibly preventing
certain types of cancer.”

In the study, cells of the im-
mune system from healthy do-
nors were exposed to dendritic
cells generated in vitro (outside
the body) that contained pep-
tides from a breast cancer cell

-to as the pacemakers of the im-
mune system — they are the ﬁrst
cells to recognize and process
antigens. Antigens are substances
that cause the immune system to
make a speciﬁc immune response
by producing antibodies and
killer T cells.

ined the immune responses that
were generated, they determined
that their target was a fragment
derived from cyclin B1, a pro-

and proliferation. They also
found that cyclin B1 was over-
expressed in breast and lung can-
cer cells, as well as squamous cell
carcinomas of the head and neck,
but not in normal cells, indicat-
ing that it is a tumor antigen.

UPB institute

national parks

Thomas Pauley, director of
the Allegheny Institute of Natu-
ral History at Pitt’s Bradford
campus, and a group of scientists
and students will be turning over
rocks and logs and looking in
streams and ponds next spring to
ﬁnd, examine and count amphib-
ians and reptiles in eight national
parks.

Pauley’s work is part of a two-

‘ year project for the National

Parks Service, which granted the
institute $114,000.

“As soon as that ﬁrst rain starts
in the spring, we’re going to have
to pack it up and be over there
waiting,” said Pauley, a noted
herpetologist. “The amphibians
and reptiles will be coming out
en masse.” Currently, those cold-
blooded animals aretburrowed
underground to stay warm, he
said. '

Amphibians, which include
frogs, toads and salamanders, are
very susceptible to the environ-
ment. They “lack a protective
covering, their eggs don’t have
shells and their larvae have gills

ronment. F or these reasons and
because they live on both land
and water, amphibians “can tell

Amphibians also are abun-
dant. In some places, the redback
salamander, which is found in
northwestern Pennsylvania,
numbers between 10,000 to
20,000 salamanders per. acre.
Salamanders are the best in-
sect predators on the ground,
and are food themselves for rac-
coons, turkeys, snakes and bears.
Reptiles are not so suscep-

but are losing habitats because
of urban sprawl. Reptiles are
major predators: Snakes kill
many rodents, and turtles are
good scavengers.

New silicone
breast implant
to be studied '

A new kind of silicone breast
implant will be used in a clinical
trial beginning at Magee-
Womens Hospital that may sig-
nal a return to silicone gel im

.  ..   ,  

The study, which is being
undertaken by UPMC’s division
of plastic surgery,_ will focus on
the CoheSIL implant manufac-
tured by McGhan Medical
Corp., a Santa Barbara, Calif.-
based company that makes both
saline— and silicone-ﬁlled breast
implants.

“For a great many American
women, breast reconstruction
provides a tremendous psycho-
logical, physical and emotional
uplift following breast cancer
surgery,” said Kenneth C.
Shestak, study principal inves-
tigator and interim chairperson
of the division of plastic surgery

at Pitt’s School of Medicine.’

“And for many more, breast aug-

mentation may lead to a more

fulﬁlling life through better con-
ﬁdence and an improved ‘self-
image.”

The study is designed to ex-

‘amine the safety and efﬁcacy of
the new implant, which contains
a silicone gel and has a more
durable casing than previous
models. ' .

“Silicone has been considered
by many plastic surgeons to be a
more desirable alternative to sa-
line implants for breast augmen-
tation and reconstruction,” said
Shestak, who is an associate pro-
fessor of surgery.

The CoheSIL implant is
made of cohesive silicone gel and
is encased in a silicone shell that
is designed to hold its shape bet-

In addition, a textured surface

Magee-Womens Hospital is
seeking to enroll at least 10
women who are considering
breast reconstruction surgery
and who will think about receiv-
ing the CoheSIL implants;

In the late 1980s, safety con-
cerns prompted litigation re-
garding silicone breast implants,
and eventually led to their with-
drawal for use in routine breast
augmentation in the United
States in 1992. However, links
between the implants and a Vari-
ety of health problems have been
disproved, according to large
collaborative studies of the medi-
cal literature in the United States
and the United Kingdom. The
U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has designated the im-
plants as Class III medical de-
vices, subject to FDA approval.

Shestak, a noted plastic sur-
geonwho has done more than
1,000 implant procedures dur-
ing his 18-year career, said a re-

view of virtually all studies pub— ’

lished in peer-reviewed medical
journals supports the safety of
silicone implants. Current stud-
ies also ﬁnd no connection be-
tween the use of a silicone im-
plant and any known disease in
humans. -

The National Academy of
Sciences’ Institute of Medicine
(IOM) reported in 1999 that a

a basis for health concerns re-

A total of 940 patients will
participate in the CoheSIL study
at 47 centers nationwide, with
about halfienrolled for augmen-
tation and the remainder sched-

uled for reconstruction or revi-

sion surgery. The Magee study
is restricted to breast reconstruc-
tion cases. ’ .
Women who are considering
such breast surgery must be at-
least 18 years old and meet cer-

tain other criteria to enroll in the A
_ CoheSIL trial. .

UPMC to use
surgical pen
to treat atrial
fibrillation i
The.UPMC Health System
is one of nine centers in the
United States to evaluate an ex-
perimental surgical “pen” for the
treatment of the most common
cardiac rhythm disorder, atrial
ﬁbrillation. I «
UPMC is the second center
in the United States to perform
surgery using the Medtronic
Cardioblate RF Surgical Abla-
tion System, a device that allows
surgeons to “draw” lines on the
heart’s upper chambers, essen-
tially creating a maze that blocks
the irregular rhythms. To-date,

—UPMC surgeons have per-_

formedthe surgery in three pa-
tients. '-

ing in the right and left atria.
Rapid and chaotic beats, inde-
pendent of the .ventricles, cause
patients to experience palpita-
tions, dizziness, fatigue, chest
discomfort and/or shortness of-
breath. Such inefficient pump-
ing in the atria can cause blood

flow to be sluggish, increasing‘;

the likelihood that clots will form

that result in stroke. ,
AF affects more than 5.5 mil— _

lion worldwide. Its prevalence

increases with age"— almost 70.

percent with AF are between 65
and 85 years of age. More than a

third of those affected are con- —

sidered to have chronic AF and
have failed medical treatments
that include drugs and techniques
designed to restore normal
rhythm. V

-The Cardioblate pen was de-
signed to simplify an otherwise
complicated and tedious surgi-
cal procedure to treat AF . While
highly effective, few surgeons
perform the surgery, called the
Maze, because of its complexity;
the surgery involves making

more than 34 incisions on the '
inside surface of the atria and-

suturing these incisions to cre-
ate a “maze” that interrupts the
pathways of erratic electrical
impulses. Using the Cardioblate
pen, which at its tip delivers a
cool irrigation ‘fluid and
radiofrequency energy, surgeons

ing incisions. ‘ ”

dure. And without the tedious

cutting and sewing, the pen al-
lows us to draw the same sort of
pattern, but in less than 15 min-

utes. Importantly, as with the

traditional maze operation, the
surgeon has access to the left
atria, where most of the irregu-
lar impulses originate. Outpa-
tient ablation techniques can only
address problems in the right
atrium,” said Marco A. Zenati,

assistant professor of surgery in
the Pitt medical school’s divi-
sion, of cardiothoracic surgery,

and principal investigator for the
Pittsburgh study. Zenati is
among only 10 or so surgeons in
the United States trained to per-
form the modiﬁed maze with the
Cardioblate pen.

Currently, use of the device
is limited to those who meet cri-
teria for entry into the study as
well_as to those who require car-
diac surgery to correct another
heart problem besides AF.

Medtronic expects data of the
U.S. study, as well as data col-
lected in Europe, to lead to ap-
proval of the device by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) early next year. Approval
would mean the device would be
indicated for patientsgwith AF.

progress, say scientists at Pitt’s

~-\ School of Medicine in a report in

\thei-December issue of Psycho-
somatic Medicine.

The researchers, led by
Timothy H. Monk, professor
of psychiatry at the Pitt medical
school, found that the endog-
enous circadian pacemaker
(ECP), which is the part of the

. braincontrolling the body’ s cycle
of sleep, wakefulness, alertness,
temperature and brain chemis-
try, is able to maintain its 24-
hour rhythm for about 90 days
-onceremoved from the natural
time cues on Earth. After that
time, the inﬂuence of the ECP
appears to diminish signiﬁcantly
and the quantity and quality of
sleep drops.

“Man’s ability to leave Earth
and travel in space raises the
question of whether the human
endogenous circadian pace-
maker, which evolved on a planet
with a 24-hour rotation, would
still function well when removed
from all of the natural time cues

‘ of Earth,” said Monk. “Our study
shows that human kind mayneed

to ﬁnd ways to trick the ECP
into maintaining a strong 24-
hour cycle if we are to succeed
on longer missions.”

According to Monk, studies
of animals orbiting in
microgravity and the weightless-
ness astronauts experience while

in orbit have suggested that
mechanisms which keep the ECP
“on-track, ” such as day and night,

might be weakened in space.

With funding from the National

Aeronautic and Space Adminis-
tration and cooperation from
American astronaut Jerry M.
Linenger, who is a co-author of
the study, the researchers set out

 

to determine how Linenger’s
ECP would change as the mis-
sion progressed and how those
changes would impact his sleep,
alertness and performance.

V Linenger lived aboard Rus-
sian Space Station Mir for nearly
ﬁve months, fromJanuary to May
of 1997. The mission was an
eventful one with a ﬁre aboard,
coolant leaks and a near colli-
sion. He has written a book about
the mission titled “Off the Planet:
Surviving Five Perilous Months
Aboard the Space Station Nlir.”
While aboard Mir, Linenger re-_
corded data on himself from
three measurement blocks, each
almost two weeks in duration.
Linenger habitually went to bed
and arose at fairly regular times.
During each measurement block
Linenger was required to mea-
sure his oral temperature and
rate his subjective alertness ﬁve
times, per day, recording his re-
sults on a laptop computer.

During each “morning” of a
measurement block, within one
hour of waking, Linenger com-
pleted a computer-based version
of the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary,
which yields measures of the
times of bedtime and waking,
the estimated duration of un-
wanted wakefulness and the
amount and rated quality of the
sleep obtained the preceding
(‘night’),

‘ Over the course of the mis-
sion the data showed an appar-

ent “ﬂattening” in the time-of-
day function of Linenger’s body
temperature and alertness, indi-
cating weakened ECP inﬂuence.
These ﬁndings coincided with
his subjective impressions. In
block three, Linenger often
forced himself to go to bed “by
the clock” without feeling sleepy
as a deliberatestrategy to keep a
rigid routine and to lessen the
feeling of being dissociated from
24-hour time.

“Because one of the major
functions of the ECP is to pre-
pare a person for a restful night
of sleep, we were particularly
concerned with what would hap-
pen to the sleep variables during
block three,” said Monk. “We
found a drop in the estimated
amount of sleep Dr. Linenger
got during that block, resulting
mostly from an increase in the
number of times he woke up
during the night. This is the sort
of sleep disruption we would ex-
pect when the ECP is not doing
its job properly.

“The bottom line is we now
know that the human body clock
may lose its inﬂuence once we
leave the planet for extended
periods,” Monk said. “We still
have to determine if and how
longer missions, such as to Mars,
could be jeopardized by perfor-
mance problems associated with
poor sleep and ECP disruption.
More research is needed with a
greater number of subjects and

better measures of ECP func-
tioning.”

The research was supported
by NASA.

Cholesterol
particle size,
number can
predict heart
attack

The size and number of lipo-
proteins in the body can predict
an individual’s risk of heart at-
tack, particularly in women, a
Pitt researcher reported at a
American Heart Association
(AHA) meeting last month.

“The higher the number of
small LDL (low—density lipopro-
tein) particles, the greater the
woman’s chances of a heart at-
tack,” said Lewis Kuller, pro-
fessor and chair, department of
epidemiology, Graduate School
of Public Health. “We found
that heart attack riskwas as much
as 2.45 times more likely for
women who had the largest num-
ber of small LDL particles com-
pared to women who had the
lowest number of small LDL
particles.”

Heart disease is the No. 1
killer of women in the United
States, and almost 60 percent of
the people who die of a heart
attack die suddenly outside of a
hospital.

By assessing this new marker,
researchers believe that physi-
cians may be in a much better
position to initiate therapy to

reduce the risk of heart attack or
prevent atherosclerosis before it
becomes full-blown disease.
Kuller points out that lipopro-
tein size and distribution can be
improved not only by drug
therapy, but by diet and exercise
as well for many individuals.

Kuller presented results of a
study that evaluated lipoprotein
size and number from blood
samples taken from 1,849 par-
ticipants in the Cardiovascular
Health Study. The project evalu-
ated stored blood samples from
patients who were followed for
ﬁve to six years. Participants were
aged 65 and older, with one
group representing the controls,
a second group that ultimately
experienced heart attack and a
third group free of subclinical or
clinical cardiovascular disease.

Results showed that women
who had experienced a heart at-
tack had large numbers of small
LDL particles. The association
was stronger in women than in
men.

Small LDL particles are more
likely than large particles to cause
the buildup of plaque along arte-
rial walls. LDL cholesterol is
often referred to as “bad” cho-
lesterol when compared with
HDL (high-density lipoprotein),
or “good” cholesterol.

Although lipoproteins were
once difﬁcult and costly to mea-
sure, nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging technology now makes
an analysis of lipoprotein size
and number a relatively simple
task.

Initiative launched to
replace books missing

from Hillman Library

An initiative has been
launched to acquire books for
Hillman Library, and to replace
the thousands of books that have
been lost or stolen over the years.

Financed with $2 50,000 from
the Ofﬁce of the Provost, the
project is called the Library Un-
dergraduate Collection Initiative
(LUCI), and focuses on obtain-
ing books of interest to under-
graduates. The University Li-
brary System will set aside
$50,000 yearly to maintain the
plan.

Over a recent four—month
period, approximately 600 books
were reported as lost or missing
from Hillman Library, which
holds about two million volumes.

According to assistant uni-
versity librarian Fern Brody,
“These lost books cover a wide
range of topics —— a book on

Stevie Wonder; the best seller, ’

‘On Photography,’ and books of
poetry and popular literature, to
name a few.” Brody also is solic-
iting input from Hillman bibli-
ographers about what new vol-
umes to order, with suggestions
ranging from more books on
philosophy to biographies of
Harry S Truman.

According to Provost James
V. Maher, the initiative is part of
an overall University effort to
enhance the undergraduate ex-
perience. “That means provid-
ing our students with a compre-
hensive environment to develop
their talents,” said Maher. “With
this particular commitment, we
will be providing many impor-
tant library resources for our
undergraduates to explore. In my
opinion, that goes to the core of
an undergraduate education,
which is helping studentslearn
to learn on their own.” I

UPT launches public phase of fund drive

Pitt’s Titusville campus last
month launched the public phase
of its capital campaign, “Blue—
print for Progress.” The goal of
the campaign is $1.5 million.

The money will go for physi-
cal plant renovations, new aca-
demic programs, scholarships
and other campus needs.

Titusville President Michael
A. Worman said that $800,000
had been raised or pledged dur-
ing the campaign’s quiet phase,
including $100,000 from the
John Nesbit Rees and Sarah
Henne Rees Charitable Foun-
dation, which went to renovate
the snack bar in the McKinney

Student Union.

“This jumpstart in UPT’s
capital campaign is a positive
refection of strong support that
already exists and a ﬁrm indica-
tion of this campus’s ability to
reach its goal,” Worman said.

Other plans call for the reno-

nut Street, which bisects the
Titusville campus, and the cre-
ation of a park area with brick-
lined walkways, a stone
entranceway, a campus green, a
specially designed clock tower
and new landscaping.

The physical plant improve-
ments are expected to be com-
pleted by August 2002.

UPT also plans to add at least

two new associate degree pro-
grams over the next ﬁve years at
an approximate cost of $300,000.
These programs are expected to
attract about 60 new students.
The campaign hopes to raise
some $200,000 in support of stu-
dent scholarships. Approxi-
mately 95 percent of Titusville
students receive ﬁnancial aid of
some kind. I

Campus tree-trimming planned

In the upcorningweeks, some
trees on the Cathedral of Learn-
ing lawn and in front of Trees
Hall will get a pruning.

The Ofﬁce of Facilities Man-
agement has contracted with
Davey Tree Co. for the selective
trimming of the larger trees in
these areas. The work will in-
clude removing structurally un-
sound limbs and a small number
of diseased trees, which will be
replaced. Some tree canopies will
be thinned to allow light to pen-
etrate and air to circulate.

The project will be overseen
by Paul Minor, Facilities Man-
agement landscape architect, in

consultation with Walt Carson,
Pitt Arts and Sciences faculty
member and forest ecologist.
As part of a larger effort to
beautify Pittsburgh campus out-
door spaces, Facilities Manage-
ment employed the firm of
VanYahres Associates, which
evaluated the condition of the
trees. VanYahres also is expected
to issue a report in January rec-
ommending improvements to
the campus’s green spaces, ac-
cording to University architect
Park Rankin. That report will be
reviewed by the administration
and appropriate University Sen-
ate committees, Rankin said. I
