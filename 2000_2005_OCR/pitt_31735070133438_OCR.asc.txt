Afghan factions
disagree on peace

PETER BAKER
The Washington Post

KABUL, Afghanistan — A

_ landmark. Afghan power—sharing

agreement began fraying Thursday,
just a day after it was signed in
Germany, as prominent political
leaders left out of the new interim
government vowed to boycott it or
try to reopen negotiations.

Withcopies of the 10-page doc-
ument still churning out of fax
machines, several key figures,
including a powerful northern war-T
lord and the current de facto
finance gminister, complained that
the U.N.-brokered pacft did ‘not
include all the factions in Afghan
society.

Without broad support, they
warned, the agreement could be

_doomed to failure.

New Pitt group tackles ‘sensible’ drug control policy

LARA HUFFMAN
Staff Writer’,

At the inaugural meeting of the Students for a
Sensible Drug Policy on Wednesday night, students
shared a bag a bag of Hempzel Pretzels.

SSDP officershanded out informational packets

about the group and its primary issues to everyone ~
‘ before the meeting began. The group also passed‘

around hemp granola bars along with the Hempzel
Pretzels. . .

Adam Claessens, president of SSDP, said he
-attempted to start an SSDP chapter at Pitt’s
Johnstown campus last year andbut gave up after
receiving little support from the campus. He trans-
ferred to main campus thisyear, and according" to’
Claessens, the campus’ reception to the-organization
has been much more positive. ’

Claessens and Vice President Alex Katzrnan
attended the 3rd Annual SSDP Leaders Conference
on Nov. 10 and 11, where Ralph Nader was the
keynote speaker. Claessens said attendees leamed all
about the organization, and that the conference “high-
ly motivated” them to start a chapter at Pitt.

At the beginning of Wednesday’s meeting, stu-
dents watched the national SSDP video from last

‘year, and then officers went into» detail about the

issues the -organization wants to address. a '

« The Industrial Hemp. issue was the number ‘one .

priority at the meeting, because according to
Claessens, thegovernment plans to. pass a law mak-
ing hemp products illegal. SSDP officers wanted to
collect signatures for a petition that they hope to fax

to the Drug Enforcement Agency_ office before Dec. .

10. - .

According to the Website wwwllx/Iotehemp.org, it
is illegal to grow industrial hemp in‘ the United States,
so the hemp industry imports sterilized seed and fiber
for its products. If the law were passed, then the hemp
products -intended for consumption, such as food
products or hemp lotion, would become illegal.

“I have never heard of someone getting high from
lotion,” Claessens said. _ C‘

According to Claessens, hemp is not marijuana,
and the two are structurally different plants. '
Claessens said that hemp is “anti—marijuana” because
it has afairly high percentage of CBD, a substance
that blocks the marijuana high. The THC levels in
industrial hemp are so low that no one could get high
from smoking it, he said. V '

Claessens told those in attendance at the meeting

that on Tuesday, he and three other people went

(1

Downtown tothe Department_ of Justice Building. He
said security escorted them out of the building, but
not before SSDP gave a couple of employees hemp

candy. He said the four members handed out 75 infor- -

mational packets j about industrial hemp during the
Downtown lunch break. ‘

After the‘ Downtown ‘demonstration, the group
came back. to campus and handed “out information

packets and hemp-based foods in front of the William

Pitt Union. . - _
SSDP hopes to address the Higher Education Act
reform next semester. The act,.._c‘reated more than 30
years ago, establishes many federal financial aid pro-
grams, such as work—study programs. and Pell grants.

‘In 1998, the government revised the act, ‘and now the
' provision denies financial aid to students who admit

to drug convictions on their applications forms.
According to Claessens, SSDP is in favor of the

reform because the provision affects students who ‘

rely on ﬁnancial assistance for college, but not stu-
dents who can afford college without aid. p

The provision is also “indirectly discriminatory,”
according to Claessens,-who said that blacks are con-

victed of drug offenses 13 times more often than

Administrators, politicians
dedicate new Hillman room

DANIEL MASNY
The Pitt News

On hand at the dedication and ribbon-
cutting ceremony for the K Leroy Irvis
Reading Room in Hillman Library were —
among others -4 Pittsburgh Mayor Tom
Murphy, Representative William R.
Robinson, (D—Hill District), Representative
Joseph Preston (D—East Liberty), Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg and Irvis himself.

Irvis made history in 1977 when he
became the ﬁrst black speaker of the
Pemisylvania House of Representatives, and
the ﬁrst black speaker of any state house of
representatives in the United States. In his
acceptance speech, Irvis had emphasized not
his race but the quality of his character.

“You have elected not a black man to be
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
but, more importantly, you have elected a
man who happens to be black,” he had said.

Irvis was the longest-running leader of
the Pennsylvania State House of
Representatives in history, serving 26 years
from 1969 until 1995. He was well respect-
ed for his oratory and his ability to hear out
another member’s viewpoint no matter how
much he disagreed with him or her.

“There is no one in the Hall of the
House to whom I will not talk and to whom

Iwillnotlisten...IwilltalkandIwilllisten

I and I will learn,” Irvis said.

The former Speakeris not only irnpor—
tant to state history, but is also a fundamen-
tal part of the history of the Pitt. Irvis was the
man who introduced and was instrumental
in passing House Bill 002 in 1966, the bill
that began state govermnent funding for Pitt.

People of all types of political power
and position were present at yesterday’s ded-
ication, all of whom spoke about how great-
ly they were inﬂuenced by and how much
they admired  —

“The man is the Muhammad Ali of
Pennsylvania politics,” Preston said.

Dr. Brent Glass called Irving a “states-
man, scholar, poet, and gentleman.”

Nordenberg referred to him as’ a

Renaissance man. Irvis, as well- as
Nordenberg, is a graduate of Pitt’s School of
Law. .

Rush Miller, Director of the University
Library System, opened the ceremony by
saying the room “beﬁts the life and the soul
of the gentleman it honors.”

The new room, located on the first ﬂoor
of Hillman Library, will house the personal
papers, articles, poems, artwork and sculp-
tures of the former Speaker. It also has a
small oﬂice where Irvis will be from time to
time to answer questions. '

The Pitt News‘

Pittsburgh Life Sciences
Greenhouse Inc. elected Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg and Dr. Jared L.
Cohon, president of Carnegie Mellon,
co-chairrnen of its board of directors at
a conference Tuesday. The board also
named Dennis Yablonsky, already the
president and CEO of the “Pittsburgh
Digital Greenhouse, the president and
chief executive officer of the board.

The Pittsburgh Life Sciences
Greenhouse is a $600 million collabo-
ration ., between Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon» intended to make Pittsburgh a
leader in Southwestern Pennsy1vania’s
biotechnology industry. The project
was spawned by the recent biotechno-

logical revolution resulting from the.

Human Genome Project and other sci-
entiﬁc advances.‘
“Our vision combines the desire to

advance the humanity with the need to

advance the region,” said Nordenberg
in a press release.‘ I .

Both Nordenberg and Cohon
endorsed Yablonsky at the conference.
Cohon said in a press release,

“[Yablonski] understands the possibili-
ties of the laboratory and the realities
and opportunities of the commercial
world, and he knows how to build the
bridges between them.”

According to a Pitt and CMU press
release and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
the 153—page plan was submitted to the
state of Pennsylvania on Nov. 19 to
request $40 million in state biotechnol-
ogy funds over five years to create the
Life Sciences Greenhouse. These funds
are part of $100 million in tobacco set-
tlement money designated by former
Gov. Tom Ridge last June to fund three
Pennsylvania Life Sciences
Greenhouses.

The plan combines Pitt’s wealth of

medical knowledge with CMU’s com-
puter and information technology in

order to create 5,000 jobs over the '

course of 10 years.

According to the press release, the
prospectus deﬁnes four main research
foci: drug discovery tools and targets,
medical devices and diagnostics, tis-
sue/organ engineering ’and regenerative
medicine and therapeutic strategies for

Afghan factions left out voice dissent

Factions, page 1

I ambitions.

“We are very sad,” Dostum said
Thursday from Mazar-e—Sharif, the
northern city that serves as his base.
“We announce our boycott of this
government and will not go to
Kabul until there is a proper gov-
ernment in place.”

Wahidullah Sabawoon, the
finance minister for the Northern

‘ Alliance, the multi»-ethnic coalition

now running’ Kabul, said he and his’
party, Hezb-i-Islami, would try to
rewrite the agreement once negotia-
tors return to the Afghan capital.
Sabawoon will lose his post when
the interim government ‘takes
power. A ' ‘

“That meeting (in-Germany) has
not been the final solution,” he said
in an interview at the Finance
Ministry. “We will discuss it with
the delegation here in Kabul. I’m\‘
not saying I must‘ be the minister,"
but one of. the people from the--
Hezb—i-Islami party should be a
minister in the new government. 'It’s
not just.”

Under the Bonn accord, the
Northern Alliance will transfer

*power on Dec. 22 to a 30-member

interim government to be led by
Pashtun tribal leader Hamid Karzai
for four to six months. Then a loya
jirga , or national council, will be
called to create a transitional gov-
ernment topave the way for a new
constitution and democratic elec-
tions within two years.

To achieve consent of the four i

delegations-represented in Germany

—- the Northern Alliance‘, -the party _

of former king Mohammed Zahir
Shah andexile groups backed by
Iran and Pakistan — the negotiators
divided up the interim cabinet along
ethnic and political lines. Although
the Northern Alliance’s political
leader, former president
Burhanuddin Rabbani, was forced
to step aside, the alliance kept con-
trol of key departments: defense,
interior and foreign affairs. All
three are to be led by Tajiks, gener-
ating consternation among other
groups. ' .

Dostum said he had demanded ,

control of foreign affairs, but this
Uzbek faction _got the departments

of agriculture and mines and indus- , ,

‘try. Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf, a
Pashtun leader of -the Ittihad-i-
Islami, or Islamic Union, wanted.
the interior department, which con-
trols domestic security, according‘
to an ally. . .

While Dostum had a representa-

tive in Germany — and Dostum

repeated that he supported the U.N.

peace process —— he said his boycott
of the new interim government
meant helwould deny it access to
the north and its oil and gas
reserves. ,
Dostum said Karim Khalili, a
leader of the Hazara ethnic group
and currently master of the Bamian
area of central Afghanistan, was
also disgruntled. And Qazi-Amin
Waqad, leader of Hezb—i-Islami,
said Sayyaf, a leader of the
Wahhabi branch‘ of Islam in
Afghanistan with the backing of
Saudi Arabia, was upset by the
Bonn agreement because the former
king would symbolically open the

loya jirga. . A ‘

“At the beginning, Mr. Sayyaf
was happy‘ with the new govern-
ment, but he didn’t want the king to
participate in the government,”
Waqad said in’ an interview at
Sayyaf’s home in Kabul while the
owner was ‘away. “When he saw that
the king would participate in“ the
loya jirga, he got-unhappy and told
his delegation not to sign.”

Waqad said he tried to calm
Sayyaf. “I asked Say‘yaf to stand

~with the temporary government and

support it,” he said. “If he is.not
supporting this temporary govern-

. ment, I told him to just sit quiet.”

“Pittsburgh is uniquely positioned
to take advantage of this trend as we
have a world-class bioscience research
institution in i the University of
Pittsburgh and a world—class computer —

Much of the project’s framework is
in place, including its planned $1.3 to
$1.5 million per year budget, according

,to the Life Sciences Greenhouse.

report. The organization will employ
nine people, including a CEO. It also
predicts production of 90 start-up
biotechnology companies and the
attraction of 25 existing companies to
the Pittsburgh region within the next 10
years. .
According to the Post-Gazette arti-
‘cle, one of the most ambitious’ and

«pricey goals is the $270 million con- »

struction of new university buildings.
Pitt and CMU want new, state-of-
the-art facilities to house most research
associated with the Life Sciences .
Greenhouse and to attract big-name
researchers who will, in turn, attract
large amounts of federal funding.
According to the Post-Gazette,
another reason Pitt and CMU want their
share of federal‘ funding is because
most funds are delegated to non-univer-
sity labs headed by large researchers.
Pitt is planning to construct a
300,000 ‘square foot building along
Fifth Avenue and a nearby 30,000.

‘ square foot biology annex. CMU is

planning a 300, 000 square foot
“Morewood Life Sciences Complex.” -

Along with these buildings, an $8
million biomedical incubator and
unspeciﬁc “Research Park” area are
also planned for construction in the
Oakland area. _ ‘

$206 million of the $600 million
would be used to attract and retain fac-
ulty by offering proﬁtable start-up

According to a November publica-
tion by the Department of Education,
the provision has denied ﬁnancial aid
to more than 21,000 students convicted
of misdemeanor and felony drug con-
victions since 1998. The article also
said that a conviction of a crime such
as rape, murder or arson does not dis-
qualify a student- from receiving ﬁnan-
cial aid.

Claessens said he thinks the provi-
sion punishes students twice for the
same crime. ,

“They already paid their debt to the
criminal justice system,” Claessens

sai

Claessens called the Higher
Education Act’s provision “a ﬂawed
piece of legislation” because it ignores
the real drug problem that occurs on
campuses — underage drinking.

Next semester, SSDP plans to
focus more on the Higher Education
Act provision issue. The organization
would like to persuade Student
Government Board to endorse U.S.

Sen. Barney Franks’ resolution to.

repeal the provision.

SSDP would also like to set up a
tuition fund for students who have been
denied ﬁnancial aid because of the pro-
vision through Pitt’s financial aid
administration.

‘A date which will live in infamy’

‘This is no drill.”

Sixty years ago today, the Commander
in Chief of the ‘ Paciﬁc Fleet, Admiral
Husband E. Kimmel, sent these words in a

telegram to ships near Hawaii to inform _

them that Japanese planes had just attacked
the American naval base at Pearl Harbor in
Hawaii.

_ Almost three months ago, we heard
similar words from our media as we
watched the World Trade Center collapse
and the Pentagon burn on our televisions.

This Pearl I‘ Harbor anniversary has
taken on a new signiﬁcance following the
Sept. 11 attacks.

Now our generation understands the
surprise, astonishment and fear our grand-
parents felt that day.

Members of a generation that previous-
ly felt shielded felt vulnerable for the ﬁrst
time both then and now.

In 1941, hysteria spread on the West
Coast as rumors of imminent Japanese
attacks spread.

In 2001, the downtown areas of cities
across the country, including Pittsburgh,
emptied. _

The image of a jumbo jet crashing into
the second tower as smoke billowed from
the ﬁrst will join the image of planes swoop-
ing down on the sinking U.S.S. Arizona in
America’s collective memory.

On this day, we must remember the
massive changes that Pearl Harbor brought
to our grandparents’ lives, changes that we

thanlcﬁrlly have not yet experienced. ,

Within four days of the attack, the
United States was at war with Germany,
Japan and Italy. Society mobilized for war.
A draft was already in place by this time.
The country rationed food and other basic
goods.

By contrast, after Sept. 11 only a small
number of troops are currently in
Afghanistan. We’re encouraged to live our
lives as we had before. Rather than
rationing, We’re encouraged to spend.
Rather than being on a war footing, much of
the public ignored Director of Homeland
Security Tom Ridge’s warnings of immi-
nent new attacks earlier this week.

But we still feel that our world has
changed. Sixty years from now, we will
commemorate Sept. 11."

So in this new context, today is a day to
reﬂect on what happened Dec. 7, 1941.-
After the Sept. 11 attacks, it no longer seems
so distant, so far in the past. Today we must

remember the sacriﬁces our grandparents.

endured as the United States went
overnight from isolationism to ﬁghting
against the evils of Nazism and fascism.

Today is the day to remember those
who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor and
throughout World War H. Today is also the
day to remember the surviving members of
the same generation. Today, we should
thank them for what they did for us. Today,
we should thank them for the fact that we
don’t live under fascism or Nazism.

Does ‘intelligent’ mean educated?

During the summer, I worked. with a
guy named Jason who regularly wowed me
with his knowledge of everything ﬁom
medieval Irish history and Eastern philoso-
phy to how to ﬁx a broken espresso grinder.
When we talked about books, he rattled off
an impressive list of his favorite authors,
from Nabokov to Hesse, and others so eso-
teric I’ ve never heard of them. 9

like that one are an essential part of our
economy. We could not ftmction in our day-
to—day lives if we did not have construction
workers, plumbers and garbage men to keep
our world running smoothly. It’s nothing but
arrogance for us to look down on people
who fulﬁll absolutely necessary roles.

articulate, well-read and all-
around intelligent people I
know —-— but he never went to
college. ,

I was always raised with
the~assumption that I would
go to college and most likely
graduate school as well.
When, at age seven; I
declared I wanted to bee,
beautician, my parents quick-
ly deterred me. They, like
most people I know, assumed that everyone
— regardless’of their actual interests —
needed a college degree to earn a decent liv-
ing. More and more, I’m finding that I don’t
agree with that logic.

Some of the most intelligent people I
know never went to college.‘ Jason is one
particularly striking example of that. He did
not need professors or the threat of exams
and grades to motivate him to learn. Rather,
his intelligence was a mix of very practical
skills —-— he was the one who changed my
tire when I got a ﬂat and ﬁxed everything at
work —— with more academic subjects like
literature and history. _ K ‘

Almost all guidance counselors in high
schools push students into college. In my
high school, a representative from the voca-

year to tell interested students about the pro-
grams available. Almost without exception,
students mocked the idea of going to a
vocational school. ' ‘

of ‘us, the choice of a blue—col-

anything about intelligence.

because he or she was not smart enough to
go to college; " '

- But I’ve since met several incredibly V

bright blue-collar workers, including a

misses the entire idea of higher education, ’

which is something that is not necessarily

Microsoft’s proposal will stimulate “economy

After weeks of rough-and-tumble negotiations,
Microsoft’s slithery lawyers have emerged once again
with what might finally be an acceptable settlement in
the company’s ongoing antitrust battle.

On Dec. 5, The New York Times reported that
under the terms of the settlement, Microsoft will
donate more than $1 billion in computers,-

16,000 poorest school districts. The plan is a
godsend for those students who have no other
economic means to receive the kind of train-
ing, education and experience with computers
essential to white-collar employment oppor-
tunities.
Critics nevertheless cited two seemingly
fundamental-ﬂaws within this proposal.
V The standard objection is that the propos-
al sets the stage for the world’s most ironic

    

Mike Darling
Columnist

But the agreement, as it is currently constructed,
will not force schools to choose PCs with Microsoft’s
Vlfindows software. Special clauses actually provide
for the distribution of Macs as an option for school
administrators. Should these administrators choose
Windows-based personal computers, Microsoft should
not be faulted. Their choice is simply a
testament to the present superiority of
its operating system. ' _

Versions of Microsoft’s Windows
software presently exist on a majority
of the computers in all American house-
holds. Likewise, many wouldjlike to see
more competition" in this ﬁeld, but
doing so would be a mistake. More
competition could lead to several differ-
ent and potentially incompatible operat-
ing systems, which in turn would mean

Catch-22: What is supposed to be an antitrust
settlement will actually serve to stiffen Microsoft’s
stranglehold on the personal computing industry. ,

The second objection is that such an agreement
will allow Microsoft to make inroads into the public
school sector of the American economy, a sacred terri-
tory where Steve Jobs and Apple established their
strongest base of support.

Those who fear a personal computer siege grace-
fully brought to my attention that the Mac is vastly
superior to the PC when the assignment in question
entails anything including the words “graphics” or
“editing. ‘ -

unnecessary and extremely expensive
training for both home users and office workers. '

The integration of people, computers and informa-
tion systems is vital to the advancement of globaliza-
tion. One way to increase this productivity is to keep
every country working with uniform software.

And most importantly, this philosophy is also key
to the students in the 16,000 underprivileged school
districts where Microsoft will extend its vast resources
because these children will be counted upon to stimu-

late America’s ﬂagging economy upon graduation .

from their respective schools. A ,
These students need to learn and master the soft-

ware being utilized by major corporations. It gives.

them the best opportunity to make ‘a smooth transition
from high school to the workforce.-

Windows training farniliarizes both students and
adults with the most commonly used piece of software
today, which grants immediate access into the white-
collar workplace while simultaneously working to
reverse the effects of the rapidly widening digital
divide. But this will only occur if VV1ndows remains”
the standard operating system for all personal comput-
ers.

For "the first time in nearly eight years, the
American economy is in the midst of an ofﬁcial .,reces_-_
sion, and what better way to stimulate the economy
than to educate the thousands of students from 16,000
school districts nationwide with the skills to word-
process, e-mail and conduct Internet research? As col-
lege students, these are privileges that we take for
granted. ’ .

Imagine the potential effects on the economy if the
students - from each of these 16,000 school districts
were given the kind of education that would enable
them to get better jobs and ﬁnally move — literally --

out of the ghetto. President George W. Bush has spo- - '

ken at length about the positive effects of a trickle-

down economy. But whenpriming the pump fails to I

produce, perhaps we‘ should consider lowering the
bucket.

“Well, I’ll tell you one thing — you
make one wrong move and the white man
will hang you faster than a Christmas light
on the day after Thanksgiving!”

This quote from Saturday Night Live’s
“Nat X,” played by Chris Rock, demon-
strates both his belligerence toward “the
white man” and his brutally honest
approach toward the American Christmas
light fetish. The latter of the two is more
relevant to Christmas, the subject at hand.

Most people in my neighborhood seem
to have counted down the seconds until
Thanksgiving was over and then rushed
out into the yard at 12:01 a.m. to start dec-
orating. There are even those who jumped
the gun, sitting back with a stomach full of
turkey to watch the football game with one
eye and the giant blinking Santa Claus with
the other. These folks make it undeniably
evident that, though we pull out all the
stops for this holiday, we don’t understand
it at all.

Our world has a way of corrupting
things that were once pure and sacred and
Christmas is no exception. The meaning
and integrity of the holiday is still there, but
buried deep beneath an unending pile of
reindeer, gift wrap, video games and dolls
— many of which" even" have graphic
human functions. The pinnacle of the heap
is marked by the Chia Pet, which is some-
how brought back from the dead each year
to be pathetically unpopular once again.

Push your way through all the hype and

you will find that Christmas celebrates the
birth of Jesus Christ. You may even have
noticed that the word “Christ” makes up
the first six letters of the word “Christmas.”

Unfortunately, Jesus now has a very

small role in the holiday itself. We cele-

brate Xmas now. “X” may
stand for any number of
things, but above all, it means
that Christ has been removed
from the word and the occa-
sion. It is a testimony to the

emptiness of our beloved plas-
tic holiday.

history. It involves religion and is therefore

deeply offensive to anyone who doesn’t

believe. " ,
In traditional American fashion, we

have done our best to reap all the beneﬁts ~
of Christmas without giving credit where

credit is due. We’ve danced
around creating cute charac-
ters, stories and customs.
While everyone loves Santa
Claus, his elves and all the
rest, they serve a speciﬁc pur-
pose: to secularize Christmas
and make it possible to get
caught up in the spirit without
acknowledging the existence
- of God. How could such a

ing Independence Day without
considering America, "
Valentine’s Day without love and Arbor
Day without regard for trees. Consider
Martin Luther King Jr Day. This day is set
aside armually to remember the great civil
rights leader, but suppose people celebrat-
ed it through gift exchange and tacky dec-
oration without mention of King himself.
That seems a little ridiculous.

Religious as the holiday may be, -no
one can deny that it consumes much of the
world at the end of every year, and it is not
harmful to acknowledge‘ the “reason for
season.” It’s as though Christmas is ﬁne
and dandy as long as it gives the economy

a healthy boost and spreads good cheer, but .

leave it at that —— don’t pay attention to the

Back in high school, when Christmas
break was approaching, one of _my teachers
made this simple comment: “Have a

Merry Christmas break, kids!” A friend of ,

mine responded to this, summarizing the
outlandish nature of the situation: ‘Um, I
‘Merry
Christmas.’ I’d prefer you to say ‘Happy

So enjoy your holiday break! It’s
bright, ﬂashy, meaningless and commit-
ment-free —— just the way we like it.

The Santaland Diaries

Through Jan. 6

City Theatre’s Lester Hamburg Theater
(412) 431 -CITY

'7i‘r7i‘r‘£r

LESLIE HOFFMAN
A&E Editor

Everyone has a diﬁerent take on Santa — some
believed in the jolly fat man until they were teenagers,
some never believed, and some were those evil children
who whispered in dark corners to the believers, “Santa’s

not real.” Any way you slice the fruitcake, all Americans"

have their own experience with the man in the red suit.

Author David Sedaris had a very personal relation-
ship with Santa -— he once workedas an elf at Macy’s
during the holiday season. He recorded his humorous
and personal experience in his essay “The Santaland
Diaries.” Joe Mantello adapted the essay into a one-man
play of the same name, which returns for a second holi-
day season to the City Theatre. .

Directed by Peter Flynn, the talented Jesse Tyler
Ferguson tells Sedaris’ tale of Christmas woe as a gar-
ishly clad elf named “Ckumpet.” Ferguson twinkles as he
relates each anecdote, artfully revealing a range of per-
sonalities, from the “profoundly” retarded people who
visit Santa, to the bitchy, gravelly-voiced elf manager to
the stuttering 6-year-old whose mother has instructed
him to ask Santa for “Procter and Gamble to stop animal

testing.” _

The play’s success is largely based on the innate
hilarity of Sedaris’ essay — anyone could read the essay
aloud and still embody the same humor — "but
Ferguson’s delightful personality effortlessly guides the
audience between characters and across the spare stage,
which consists of only a red chair made of candy canes
twiceasta]lasheis,bathedinredlight.

Despite the sparse set designed by Michael Olich,
Ferguson’s descriptions and stage directions allow the

’ audience to mentally recreateV.Santa’s magic land -

much like what happens when you read a book
Ferguson also manages to charm and incorporate the
audience, at one point forcing them to chant the Santa
pep cheer the elves must repeat

Although Ferguson is adept in his role as a disgrrm-
ﬂed elf, at times he’s over-the-top. Anyone familiar with
David Sedaris knows he’s kind of a wimp; Ferguson is a
bit too bombastic in the role, which at times slips into
somber commentary on the human ‘experience. After

one story about a particularly personable Santa and his .

interaction with a family, the audience sat silent.

Ferguson is capable of performing the role in a less
out-there fashion, however; as in this anecdote, he does
often slip into a more personal, ‘real, reﬂective voice.
And, he is incredibly funny; after his mere 66-minute
performance, your cheeks  hurt from laughing so
much.

Regardless of whether you believed in Santa, or
regardless of ‘whether you even celebrate Christmas,
“The Santaland Diaries” offers a fun and honest look at
the holiday, and you’ll leave the theater laughing as if
someone has spiked your egg nog.

’ forming a sea of swooping skirts,

The girls ﬂocked to see them,

sweaters and Peter Pan collars; their
shouts, screams and tears made archa-
ic by black and white clips of ﬁlm
from the 1960s. -

Whenever I see footage of these
screaming fans, I could never under-
stand why these girls went crazy over
The Beatles, even after I came to love
the lads myself. But this summer I
saw Radiohead in concert, and as my
friends and I rode the T into Boston,

Pourquoi?

Leslie Hoffman

the anticipation grew and my heart

* ﬂuttered.

Seeing ‘one of your favorite bands live is thrilling.
Adrenalin courses through your veins, and all of the docu-
mentaries and interviews you’ve seen allow you to convince
yourself that you —— of all the people in the world —- know
them better than anyone else. ‘ V

But while Radiohead was setting up for a song, Thom
Yorke talked about something that had disturbed him in a Hard
Rock Cafe. He said that he had seen Kurt Cobain’s sweater on
display in one of the restaurants. He called it disgusting.

Last weekend, I journeyed to the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in Cleveland. They’ve had a John Lennon exhibit up
since late last year, and the exhibition dates have been extend-
ed. My friends and I started at the Lennon exhibit at the top of
the museum and worked our way downstairs. The exhibit isn’t
organized in a way that truly heightens the emotion it could
evoke. In fact, the whole museum suffers from its ﬂoor plan.

But the Lennon exhibit will evoke emotion. Something
about Lennon touches everyone, regardless of whether you
like him and his work, or if you’re suspicious of his politics.
On one ﬂoor, hisimusic played as screens with his lyrics to
certain songs lit up. On another ﬂoor, we saw artifacts from
his youth -— a magazine he wrote while in grade school, draw-
ings and photographs. We saw some of his personal belong-
ings, a half a dozen pairs of grarmy glasses, his chartreuse
Sergeant Pepper’s coat. His jean jacket was small, like a
woman’s.

i But I too found something disgusting.

At the exhibit’s entrance, a tall yellow column held the
hospital’s standard-issue brown paper bag that contained the
clothes he was shot in.

I thought of Thom Yorke and his comment about‘ the
sweater, and I wondered where it stops. Where does our

curiosity end? How much do we need to know about famous

people? Or anyone, for that matter?

When do you stop being a fan and become a fanatic?
Where do we all draw that line?

I don’t know, but I’m boxing and cataloguing all my stuff
so that when I die — it’ll make the museum’s job easier.

‘Ocean’s Eleven’ not
another heist movie

Ocean’s Eleven

Starring George Clooney, Matt
Damon, Brad Pitt and Julia
Roberts .
Directed by Steven Soderbergh
s2ni‘ni‘r1/2 S

CLARE PERRETTA
Contributing Editor

In April, my parents visited Las Vegas
without me, which made me angry for two
reasons. . .

First, it was the week before my birth-
day. Second, they stayed at the Bellagio
while Steven Soderbergh was ﬁlming
“Ocean’s Eleven” there. From her video
poker machine, my mom watched Julia
Roberts ﬁlm a scene. My dad said “Hi” to
Don Cheadle while they were both in line
for the Bellagio breakfast buffet.

So be forewarned: My enthusiasm for-

“Ocean’s Eleven” may make me less objec-
tive than another reviewer of the same
movie.

The original “Ocean’s Eleven” is not a
particularly-good‘ movie. Made in 1960, it
features Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin,
Sarnrny- Davis Jr and Peter Lawford — the

cornerstone members of the “Rat Pack.” The

original movie is talky and in-jokey: a vain-
ty project ﬁlmed on location simply because
the Rat Pack wanted to take a paid vacation
in Las Vegas. Despite ﬂieir ulterior motives,
the Rat Pack never lacked charm, charisma
or chemistry. ‘ '
“Ocean’s Eleven” are the 11 guys;con
man Darmy Ocean (George Clooney)
recruits for his plan to rob three of the biggest
casinos on the Las Vegas strip: the Mirage,
the MGM Grand and the Bellagio. Brad Pitt

plays Rusty Ryan, a card shark and Matt
Damon is Linus Caldwell, a talented pick-
pocket »

Clooney and Pitt obviously enjoy work-
ing with each other, which is good, since
they spend most of the movie wise-cracking

  and working through the details of the heist  

They relate casually to one another, not at all
like two Big Movie Stars but like two bud-
dies who go way back. .

On the other hand, there is little chem-
istry between Clooney and Julia Roberts,
who plays Tess Ocean, the curator of the
Bellagio art museum and Danny’s ex-wife.‘

Arrabal drama smart

but too heavy
The Architect and the

  - Emperor of Assyria

Directed by Gang-lm Lee
Henry Heymann Theater
Through Dec. 9

aa

. HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

At this point in the year, most of us are
eager to escape the overly analytical realm of
the University for some good old—fashioned
entertainment. This is the time when stu-
dents ﬂock to the holiday blockbuster movie
— “Harry Potter,” anyone? — or the parties
of mass brain cell destruction for which
South Oakland is known. '.

With that said, some of us may still be
up for a challenge, and right now that chal-
lenge can be found at the Henry Heymann’
Theatre. Femando A1rabal"s “The Architect

and the Emperor of Assyiia” is part of

Anabal’s genre, the “theatre of panic” —
socially conscious and often explicit plays
guaranteed to work the brain. This particular
piece tells the story of a lone plane crash sur-
vivor who encounters ‘the sole inhabitant of

the desert island where he lands.

The dynamic that develops between,

them often shocks and disturbs the audience,
as the survivor (Josh Longo) begins to teach
the native. (normally played by E. Bruce Hill,
but on the night of the review Jeffrey
Cordell) the jargon of civilization. During
the course of the show, the men take on dif-
ferent roles, ‘the primary ones being the
emperor and the lesser architect — all
designed to address issues of power, gender
and religion. Longo and Cordell man their
roles bravely and show no reservation about
portraying everything from copulating mon-
keys to a mother and child.

Longo’s shining moment comes when
he portrays a nun giving birth and the doctor
supervising her, but both actors take on
simultaneous roles and slip in and out of

mini—scenes within the larger action with a‘

moment’s notice. ,
The actors’ energy and enthusiasm do a
great deal to make Arrabal’s play bearable,
but the truth is that even under the most
capable hands, “The Architect and the
Emperor’ ’ would seem less like social com-

mentary and more like the acid trip of some?

one with attention deﬁcit disorder.

It doesn’t help that Kevin Feather’s
plastic set full of fake ﬂowers, fake vines and
blatantly fake rock formations is so ﬂat as to
seem one—dimensional, although the dual

KA'I‘IE MAVRICH
Staff Writer

You can call it rock, reggae, ska or
even folk. The members of O.A.R. or,
“of a revolution,” like to call their music
island-vibe-roots-rock because it falls
into a genre all of its own.

O.A.R. hails from Maryland, near
the Washington, D.C. area.
While still in high school, they
recorded their first record,
Wanderer, which had their most
popular song “That Was a Crazy Game
of Poker” on it. Before they had‘ even
graduated high school, O.A.R.’s music
was being played at college campuses
across the country. The ﬁve members
continued their education at Ohio State
University, each taking a full course
load every semester and still finding the
time to play shows and record their sec-
ond album, Souls Aﬂame.

Although O.A.R.’s music is not
played on the radio, this does not keep

littév

Play

people from hearing their melodic toe-
tapping tunes. _
Risen, the band’s third album, was
released in February by Everfine
Records, and debuted at No. 11 on the
Billboard Top Internet Album Sales

. chart that same month.‘ The producer

and engineer of the album, John Alagia,
has worked with Dave Matthews Band,
Ben Folds Five and John Mayer. The
opening track, “Hey Gir ,” makes it
hard to sit still while you listen.

O.A.R. plays similar venues as
local band The Clarks. Their fall tour
has included the Crowbar in State
College, as well as many other colleges
and universities in the eastern part of the
country. «
Also playing with O.A.R. is VV1ll
Hoge, who has a voice similar to
Counting Crows’ lead singer Adam
Duritz. It’s not quite island-
vibe—roots-rock, but fans of
O.A.R. may find themselves
picking up _Will Hoge’s latest
CD, Carousel, after the show.

Most of us can relate to the fourth
track on this album, “Your Fool,” which
is about an ended relationship that one
of the parties involved is willing to
rekindle, no matter how big a fool he or
she looks. ,

You may not know them as well as
you know The Clarks, but O.A.R. is
sure to capture your attention with their
energy and spirit, much like The Clarks
did the first time you saw them live.

In the beginning there was Africa. .

It’s the birthplace of evolution and the
epicenter of a multitude of arts. _

Tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Belleﬁeld
Auditorium, the department of music at
Pitt presents “A Celebration of African
Music and Dance.”'The performance is
being played out by Pitt’s African
Drumming and Dance Ensemble.

dance, sing and learn about African cul-
ture,” said Tom Rucinsky, a performer in
the ensemble. « » A

Dr. Paschal Yao Younge, of Ghana,
Africa, is direcﬁng the performance, and
has been directing his ‘students throughout
the semester.

. Theconcert includes 17 Pitt students, V
who will play such instruments as the
djembe drum, the Gogota (double bell) and i.

the Fau (rattle), plus the Mingua and
Minwayo (two different drums).
A The songs that will be performed
come from several different regions of
Africa. One song called “Kpatsa” origi-
nates from the Dangme people of Ghana,
which is in western Africa.

Yao Younge and his wife Zelrna Badu—

'Friday, December 7, 2001

 

Younge have been working hard with the
students, including making the trip from
his home in West Virginia to Pitt just to
practice with the students, and then driving,‘
home after practice. ‘

This is Yao Younge’s first perfor-
mance with Pitt students. He has been
directing the West Virginia University
African Ensemble for several years, a
group that will be visiting to participate in
the concert. I "

‘This has been one of my most fulﬁll-
ing experiences at Pitt. Learning and cele-
brating African culture. straight from the’
source is an amazing opportunity that has
been rewarding to all _of us in the ensem-
ble,” Rucinsky said. -

—— Kenneth Paul, contributing editor

Arrabal, page 11 _

use of props as masks (by Tavia
LaFolletIe) in one scene is quite com-
pelling. Kudos to_ sound designer Brent
Laney for providing comic relief via the
show’s music, which often boosted both
‘the actors’ and the audience’s energy.

' There’s no question that director‘
Gang—Im Lee thinks highly of Anabal’s
work, and it was ambitiousof her to try to
make ‘”Ihe Architect and the Emperor”
interesting for a broader audience.

But Arrabal’s script often seems little
more than intellectual posturing, and two
hours after the show began, most of the
audience left more burnt out than when
we went in. '

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Wrestling dominates Bloomsburg

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Pitt’s wrestling team notched its
second win of the season last night,
with a dominating performance over
Bloomsburg.

After an opening meet loss to
Lehigh, the Panthers came back to
win two meets straight, also beating
Virginia Military Institute on Nov.
19.

The Panthers won the first seven
bouts and eight out of 10 overall for
the evening. Of Pitt’s eight victories,
two were by major decision and two
were by fall. Pitt won 35 of the possi-
ble 44 points for the 35-9 victory.

In a major decision, Mike May
dominated the l25—pound weight
class as he scored a 13-1 victory over
Mike Collins. Continuing the crush-
ing performance for Pitt was Shawn
Amistade, who major decisioned
Mark Piermettei, 15-3.

Blaise Mucci, who was coming
off of a loss to No. 12-ranked Jeremy
Wilson of Portland State in the Las
Vegas Invitational, won by fall over

Adam Castner in five minutes and 45 _

seconds, to give Pitt a 17-0 lead.

Justin Giovinco extended the
Panthers’ lead when he won by forfeit
over Jim Bertulis. Donald Rush, who
wrestled in the l57—pound match for
Pitt, added three more points to Pitt’s
tally, with a 5-3 victory over B.J.
Mikeska.

In the 165-pound meeting, Carl
Fronhofer who won five of seven
matches in the Las Vegas
Invitational, beat Matt Catullo sound-
ly, 11-4.

For the Huskies, Josh Hewes and
Justin Johnson won back-to—back
matches, in the 174 and 184-pound
matches, the team’s only two wins of
the night. Hewes defeated Pitt’s Matt
Catullo 12-7 and Johnson won by fall
over Rob Black in slightly more than
four minutes.

’Pitt’s David Sandberg quickly
ended Bloomsburg’s short run as he
defeated Andy Ludlow by fall in
5 :27, in the 197-pound contest. ‘

Jacob Lininger put the exclama-
tion point on the evening for Pitt,‘
shutting out Robert Chalet, 3-O.

“All my life, all I’ve wanted to do is play in
the NFL,” said former Pitt running back Nick

Goings.

Goings’ words accurately express the dreams
of everyone who has ever played college football.
There are 31 teams in the NFL. Each of those
teams keeps a roster of 53 players. -That equals

1,643 players at any given time.

Of the thousands that play football at the col-
legiate level, few are talented enough to be given a

chance on the national stage.

 

Throughout the history of professional foot-
ball, several schools have served as major starting
points for future professional talent. Schools like
Notre Dame,’ Georgia, Florida State and Penn State
each boast staggering numbers of alumni who have
gone on to play professional football.

While Pitt has not produced NFL-caliber talent
with the same frequency and quantity as those
schools, it has produced some of the NFL’s great-
est players.

In the past, Pitt has been represented in the
NFL by the likes of Mike Ditka, Dan Marino and
Tony Dorsett. It might surprise you to know that

Nick Goings has caught on with the Carolina
Panthers to receive some carries and a contract.

Aside "from Goings and Lytle, they also have
defensive tackle Sean Gilbert. Of the three, Gilbert
is the only one who usually sees any playing time,
but he has been injured for much of the season.

Goings signed with Carolina April 23 as an

KEVIN NASH
Staff Writer

Mike May’s initial inspiration for wanting to
wrestle was the World Wrestling Federation.

As a 7-year-old child the Ultimate Warrior
was May’s wrestling role model. May’s father
was concerned about his son’s new interest and
for a while, he wouldn’t allow May to wrestle.

His father explained the differences between
WWF wrestling and the real thing for his son,
who thought that the_WWF and junior league

wrestling were going to be similar. May eventu-.

ally convinced his dad to let him wrestle.

May’s parents have had the biggest influence
on his life, said May, especially his dad.

“He puts up with a lot from me and he has
always been there for me. He has a big heart,”
May said.

‘T May was an instant success, winning the sec-
ond tournament that he wrestled in.

He went on t‘o be a five-time junior league
wrestling state champion ‘and his accomplish-
ments have’ carried over to the next level.

. May attended Derry Area High School in his
hometown of Derry, Pa.

He posted a career record of 128-10 and was
undefeated in his junior and senior years of high

school.

May set his school record_for career wins,
the longest w-inning streak and the most career
takedowns. He was also the first state champion
in his schoo1’s history. -

Pitt began to recruit Mayafter he won the
state tournament his junior year and May signed
with Pitt shortly after.

“I felt that they had the best upcoming pro-
gram,” May said. “They have a good lightweight
coach [Sanshiro Abe], who was an Olympian
wrestler.” F

He also feels that he and head coach Rande
Stottlemyer have similar philosophies.

“I think Stottlemyer is a lot like me; he likes
to work hard,” May said. “He is not rash or arro-
gant about things. All he really wants from
everybody on the team is to give your best every
day. If you do so, he will be your best friend.”

May wrestles at 125 pounds for the.Panthers,
although natural weight is between 140 and 145
pounds. _

He’s had a fast start, with a record of 12-3,
four major decisions and one pin. He finished
fourth this weekend the Las Vegas Invitational.

One of his biggest wins this season came in
his first career dual meet victory. May defeated
Lehigh’s Mario Stuart, an All-American ranked

tMay making a solid transition to Pitt’s mats

12th by InterMat. He won the match by a score
of 4-3.

“I thought it was a big opportunity for me. I
didn’t do a lot my freshman year
as far as beating good kids,” May said. “I figured
if I beat him, people would feel that I was up
there with the best of them.” -

And to prove that he was, May defeated
Stuart again by a score of 5-1 at the Las Vegas
Invitational.

During the off-season , May trains at
wrestling camps at different colleges. He also
does a lot of lifting and running.

When May is not wrestling, he is the lead
singer of a rock band called Dust Monkey But he
doesn’t find much time to have fun.

May works out six days a week on his own
and three mornings a week with the team during
the season. His day starts at approximately 5:45
a.m to makeit to 6:30 a.m. practice.

V On the days he is not working out with the
team, he runs 4-5 miles on his own.
» May is a redshirt freshman majoring in histo-
ry. -

He plans on using the degree to become a
secondary education teacher. May said he is
using wrestling to get through school, but he
doesn’t plan to wrestle once he graduates.

Saturday should be a great day

Pitt has been kind enough to

This weekend’s game is a
chance to improve to 8-1 and Pitt
should be able to do so. ,

Along with Ramon Walker, point
guard Brandin Knight has been my
biggest pleasure to watch of all the
Pitt athletes in my four years here.

Knight leads the team with 15.1
points and 6.3 assists per game. He
is a true general on the court that
hustles on both ends of the ﬂoor. His
backcourt mate isn’t too shabby
either. - -

Julius Page, in his second season
of play, is averaging 11.3 points per
game and has effectively guarded
the opposition’s ‘top offensive threat
constantly. .

With Donatas Zavackas and
Jaron Brown both shooting and
rebounding well, Pitt could be legit.

Another opportunity to harass some Penn Staters

The upside to these cupcake games
is the fact that second-year center
Toree Morris and freshman the
team’s redshirt ‘freshmen, Mark
McCarroll, Chevy Troutman and
Yuri Demetrius have all seen play-
ing time. _

If McCarro1l can get a little
more consistent playing time, he
could make an immeditate impact.
In the mean time, Ontario Lett has
done a nice job in the middle.

Penn State lost four starters,
including the Crispin brothers, Joe
and Jon, in the backcourt. Both
could shoot the daylights out of the
ball.

Tyler Smith, a 6—foot-8-inch,

230-pound forward, leads the team «

with 14.3 points and 6.8 rebounds a
game. Luckily for Pitt, Morris is 6-
foot-10 and 282 pounds. That’s big.

With the luxury of a bowl game
down the road, it would be nice to
see the campus shift its attention to
another sport and try to get into the
basketball team. The worst that
could happen is that you get an
opportunity to boo the crap out of
Penn State.

Kenneth Paul is the sports editorfor
The Pitt News and if he hears one
more Christmas song on one of the
shuttles, he’s going to jump out of
the emergency exit head first.

Class of 2000enjoying some success in the NFL

NFL, page 20 I ‘

“To be honest, I didn’t know what was going to
happen but from that time, I focused everything in
my life to making my dream of playing in the NFL
come true and just be optimistic,” Goings said.

Not only did Goings make the team, he led the
Panthers in rushing for the first two weeks of the
season before being benched in favor of Tim
Biakabatuka. Consequently, the Panthers have not

won a game since Goings rushed for 86 yards in

week one of the season. '

Those students who were here last year surely
remember the running back tandem of Goings and
Kevan Barlow that propelled the Panthers to a 7-4
record, before losing to Iowa State in the
Insight.com Bowl. Both Barlow and Goings were
fortunate enough to be given a chance to play pro-
fessionally this year, with Barlow making the more
significant impact of the two.

Barlow, a rookie-with the San Francisco 49ers,
has spent this season backing up star tailback
Garrison Hearst. .

Despite limited playing time, Barlow has
rushed for 350 yards on 79 attempts and two
touchdowns. He has also been successful catching
the ball out of the backfield as he has 178 yards
receiving on 15 “catches and one touchdown. He is
on pace to rush for more than 500 yards this sea-
son. .

“The offense here is similar to what we ran at
Pitt; it’s the west coast offense,” Barlow said. “I
had arthroscopic knee surgery at the beginning of

_ the year and I pulled my quad really bad so that set

me back a month. I used that time to learn the
offense.” ~

Despite their new careers in new cities, Barlow
and Goings still find timeto check in on their old
teammates. Goings said he talks to his old room-
mates, Pitt quarterback David
Priestley and wide
receiver R.J. English
every - so often and
wishes them good
luck on their upcom-
ing games.

Barlow. too has
stayed close with
English, and he likes to
check up on wide receiver
Antonio Bryant.

Barlow says he miss- . A ,.
es the camaraderie of_  «
college football.

“I miss interacting
with the guys in the’lock—
er room and joking
around and laughing,” he
said. “On this level it’s
more business and in the
college it’s more like
family.” .

There are many other Panthers of note that are
currently excelling in the big leagues as well.
Former Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt has-found a
home in Buffalo, NY: where he has spent his
entire seven-year career backing up the likes of
Jim Kelley, Doug Flutie and Rob Johnson. Now,
