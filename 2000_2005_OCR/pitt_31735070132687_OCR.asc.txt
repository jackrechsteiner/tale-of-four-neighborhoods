,  Schools may offer

Same-sex beneﬁts  

PATRICK YOEST
Staff Writer

Vlfrth a new contract signed, faculty at

the 14 state-owned universities in the.

Pennsylvania State System of Higher
Education have secured their positions for
four years. 1 =

' They could also secure domestic part-
ner health beneﬁts —— which, if enacted,

would mark another milestone in the ongo- ‘V

ing dispute between Pitt and University
employees seeking beneﬁts for sarne—sex
‘partners. _
Although the agreement does not affect
Pitt -—— a state-related university, but not a
part of the State System of Higher Education
— it is the second time the issue of health
beneﬁts for partners of gay employees has
been included in contract negotfations of
public universities in Pennsylvania. S t a t e
System of Higher Education employees still
. face hurdles before they will be eligible for
the beneﬁts. For the change to take effect at
the state-owned schools, the 85,000 state
employees insured by the Pennsylvania
Employee Beneﬁts Trust Fund would ﬁrst

have to become eligible for. the new beneﬁts. '

, At that point, the union membeis of the
4 Association of Pennsylvania State College
and University Faculty would also" become
eligib1e.Last year, Temple‘ University
became the ﬁrst state-related Pennsylvania
university to offer domestic partner beneﬁts.

‘ The attaclnnent of the beneﬁts structure

of state-owned schools to the possible adop-

tion of domestic partner beneﬁts by the trust
fund is unique to the State System of Higher
Education’s new contract. State-related
schools, such as Pitt and Temple, will not be
affected by any changesto the trust fund.

Christy Leo, a spokeswoman for the
trust fund, said that a change in theibeneﬁts
structure of the state employees is currently
“not on the table,” but that a change “could ,
come from the governor, or could come '
from o11r board.” A .

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Squirrel Hill,
Whose district includes much of Pitt, said
that the impetus for the new provision in the
faculty union’s contract carne largely from
Gov. Ed Rendell. ‘

“I think the govemor is trying tomove
the state in a. direction that is forward-tl1ink-
ing and not mired down in repressed, regres-
sive thinking,” Frankel said. ' '

Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice. chancellor for
public affairs, ‘said the new contract would
have little effect at Pitt. ‘

“Pitt believes that each employer should
decide for itself, based on ‘the needs of
employees and the marketplace conditions,”
Hill said. “These should be the determining
factors of whether employers otfer beneﬁts-
or not.” ' -‘

“Rather than have legislative bodies
make - that determination, each institution
should be left alone to make its own judg-
ment,” he added. A ‘ .

Conversely, if the legislature
approves Rendell’s proposed funding,
students will be faced with -a 6 percent
increase in. tuition, raising the price of

Pitt students honored with Truman Scholarships

ANDY MEDICI -I

Staff Writer

Jocelyn Homer grew up in Pittsburgh’s
North Side, on the Mexican War streets,
where she was exposed to many diﬂ’erent
cultures. When she was accepted to Pitt, she
chose urban studies as one of her majors.

“I have always been kind of a city girl
my whole life,” Homer said. “It was a great
choice, and I never looked back.”

Homer was one of two Pitt students this
year who received the Truman Scholarship,
which provides money for undergraduate
and graduate schools to students pursuing
careers in public service.

Clare Sierawski also received the schol-
arship, and plans to help developing coun-
tries achieve sustainable development that
preserves the environment. '

“I never reallythought about the envi-
ronment  I came to college,” said
Sierawski, who is pursuing majors  envi-
ronmental studies, political science and East
Asian languages. “I’ve always been interest-
ed in languages. Being able to communicate
with people is awesome.”

The award is open to students who still .

have one year left of undergraduate studies,
and are pursuing careers in government,
nonproﬁt organizations or some other form
of public service. '

Lglmi:
iglxtciulc  

Both students are part of Pitt’s Honors
College and atnibute some of their success to
the academic enviromnent and good faculty
support. .

“It did help. me to be among a commu-
nity that was academically motivated,”
Homer said. _

. According to Homer, who is also major- _
ing in sociology, the initial application
process was long, with many written por-
tions, and took about two months to com-
plete. ‘

Both students have been involved in
campus organizations: Homer participated.
in the Campus Wom_en’s Organization and
Sierawski was one of the founding members

“What many people do not realize is
that there are a lot of dedicated Pitt students
working real hard to make a difference,”
Sierawski said.

Not only is it rare that two students from
the same school win the scholarship, but

also, Homer and Sierawski are good friends '

who met as freshmen in a Philosophy of
Film class. , 7
’’ “We were the only two students in our
recitation actually interested in talking about
the ﬁlms we watched,” Sierawski said.
Both students were amazed when they
won the scholarship. They were even more
surprised when they found out that they were
both chosen as recipients. ;‘
“I honestly couldn’t believe it when it
happened. I was sort of hysterical for two

‘days afterward,” Homer said. “It’s a great
honor to have what I’ve been,doing recog-

nized by a national organization.”
For Sierawski, the experience was sim-
ilar.

_ “I wasjust amazed —— for both ofus to
share the award is a big honor,” Sierawski
said. “I felt all tingly and a little bit like I was
in heaven.” I _

Homer will use the scholarship to con-
tinue, her education at Johns Hopkins

University, where. she’ll pursue a master’s I

degree in-public policy. She hopes to eventu-
ally obtaiii doctorate in public policy at
Harvard Urriversity.»

“I would like to continue in the non-
proﬁt [sector], and working on community
development,” said Homer, who wants to
focus on revitalizing poor neighborhoods.

“Those communities need people to
help facilitate them inmaking their commu-
nity a better place.” ‘

Sierawski plans to obtain her master’s

degree in public administration at Princeton "

University, and hopes to go on to gain a doc-

torate in intemational law. \
Like Homer, Sierawski plans to work in

the nonproﬁt sector, showing that the organi-

zation is truly interested in the welfare of .

communities. . \

"The work that I am interested in is cur-
rently being carried out by nonproﬁt
groups,” Sierawski said. “Making money
hurts your credibility. The people you will be
helping will be suspicious if you are trying to
make money.” I if

V When reminded that working for non-.
' proﬁt groups will probably not pay as much

as private sector jobs, both students were
upbeat

‘ “If\I have to sacriﬁce some material
comforts in life to be able to work in a ﬁeld
that Ircaie about, I will,” Homer said.

“Having an expensive car and a nice cell if

phone does not mean anything if you do not
like what you;dé,"’_’.
Sierawski also looks forward to the

 
 

my future and the unceitainties it holds.

“The  life is that you can’t
plan it out.”" Sierawski said. “You never
know what kind of opportunities will come
your way.” - ‘

Pitt not planning to offer
same-sex benefits soon

Same-Sex, page 1

Special Committee on Domestic Partner
Health Insurance Beneﬁts, stated that it was
reluctant to issue domestic partner beneﬁts
for fear of reprisal by the state legislature —
a claim that the American Civil Liberties
Union’s VlC Walczak ﬁnds unconvincing.
Walczak, who is the legal director of the
Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the ACLU, is
an’ attorney for seven current and former Pitt
employees who have ﬁled a lawsuit against
the University.

“Chancellor Nordenberg has no clothes
when it comes to this argument,” Walczak
said. “Pitt isn’t  beneﬁts because it
doesn’t want to give beneﬁts.” , )

Conservative legislators are again cau-
tioning universities not to offer health bene-
ﬁts for same-sex partners, but it is unclear
what further actions or eﬁects their admoni-
tions might precede.

After Temple agreed to offer domestic
partner beneﬁts to many of its employees,
state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Cranberry, said
in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article that
Pennsylvania’s state legislature had “sent a
clear message that we don’t support that.”

But the state’s 2003-2004 budget fund-
ed Temple at a similar level to other state-
related universities, including Pitt and Penn
State. Hill nevertheless maintains that the
danger of Pitt losing its state appropriation, if
it were to change its beneﬁts structure, has
not disappeared. . H’

“We remain concerned about what the
Commonwealth thinks about these bene-
ﬁts,” Hill said, citing consultation witl1_Pitt’s
liaisons on the state level.

Proponents of domestic partner beneﬁts
suggest that a new beneﬁts structure would

make Pitt more competitive, despite poten-
tial new costs. Frankel believes this is the
case, and he noted that a number of other
universities, as well as Fortune 500 compa-
nies, have made beneﬁts available for same-
sex partners. 0

Pitt’s position in the market, according
to Hill, is not fundamentally changed by new
agreements with faculty at Temple and the

possibility of future beneﬁts for State’

System of Higher Education universities.

“I think, for the land of faculty we
recruit, you have to look at AAU condi-
tions,” Hill said, referring to the American
Association of Universities, an organization

of 62 leading research universities in North

America. _

Neither Temple nor any State System of
Higher Education universities are member
institutions of AAU; According to a Human
Rights Campaign survey, at least 43 of the

62 member institutions of AAU provide ,

some kind of domestic partner health care
beneﬁts. ‘ V
But Hill said that there are a “variety of

factors that inform the‘ decision of an ,

employee to go to one institution or anoth-
er,” and that Pitt does not compete with one
single AAU member institution, but “all of
the members.” ,

Hill maintains that there is no impera-
tive for Pitt to offer beneﬁts beyond what is
already in place, despite the trend of colleges

and universities to oﬁ°er‘v domestic partner ‘

beneﬁts. ,

“There are faculty for whom the bene-
ﬁts are an issue, depending on the particular
needs of an individual employee,” he said.
‘That employee or prospective employee
should look at the totality of what this insti-
tution has to offer.” .

freshmen will pay an additional $500.
According to John Fedele, a Pitt
spokesman, this increase is designed to
improve the University.

“It’s necessary for Pitt to raise
tuition in order to continue to provide
the type of high-quality education our
students and alumni expect,” Fedele
stated. “We implemented the tiered
tuition plan to lessen the burden of our
current students, who came to the
University with a set of expectations as
to what the tuition would be for their
four years. We kept the out-of-state
lower for competitive purposes also.”

Pitt is not the only state-funded
university with a tuition increase
dependent on the legislature’s funding.

Penn State students are also wait-

ing to ﬁnd out if they will have a 4 or 6 ’

percent increase, dependent on the
amount of funding the state allots their
university. -

Penn State President Graham
Spanier has requested $346.2 million,
as compared to Rendell’s proposed
$315 million in funding. If the legisla-
ture approves Penn State’s request, stu-

dents will be looking at a 4 percent

tuition increase, as compared with the 6
percent increase the university will
impose if Rendel1’s current plan is

\\NN

approved.

Both universities are seeking to
return funding levels to the amount
they received for 2001-02, the last year
an increase was received.

As a result of the recent decreases I

in funding, university administrators at
both schools have attempted to lessen
costs for students. ,

Fedele acknowledged that cuts
may need to be made at Pitt, but he said
he is unaware of what those cuts will
be.

“We don’t know yet What we will
receive this upcoming year,” Fedele
said. “So it’s not appropriate to specu-
late what, if anything, will need to be
cut.” . 

In a similar situation, Penn ”State is
looking to outsource their budget needs
rather than make cuts.‘Assistant Vice-
President for University Relations Bill
Mahon has said, “Penn State will not

‘do anything that will have a negative
impact on quality.” He maintains that
Penn State will not reduce its quality by
cutting corners, such as increasing
class size.

According to Mahon, Penn State-

Will increase its data appropriation,

Little guys beat Wal-Mart, for once

Score one for the little guys.
In Inglewood, Calif.,

percent — a ‘ballot initiative that
would have permitted Wal-Mart, the
world’s largest retailer, to build a
60-acre complex there, according to
the Associated Press.

The charge against the behemoth
store was led by joint efforts from
unions and community groups, set
against allowing Wal-Mart to set up
shop in Inglewood.

Wal-Mart, in promoting the ini-
tiative, spent more than $1 million,
which is not a dent in their vast cof-
fers, but is a significant sum.

It is important for communities
like Inglewood to keep big-box
stores like Wal-Mart,out, so that they
can retain their diverse local ﬂavor.

Wal-Mart typically comes into a
community with the promise of jobs
and wonderful deals to be had for
the consumer. Then, using its vast
purchasing power, Wal-Mart under-
cuts all the local independent busi-
nesses out of existence. The jobs,
while numerous, offer very low
wages, and Wal-Mart often faces
allegations of union-busting in its
stores.

And while the merchandise is
priced low, it’s not local, and is
often produced in foreign sweat-

' shops.
voters ,
heartily rejected — 60 percent to 40 '

Wal-Mart spokesman
ry very neatly, despite being against
it: “We are disappointed that a small
group of Inglewood leaders, together
with representatives of outside spe-
cial interests, were able to convince
a majority of Inglewood voters that
they don’t deserve the job opportu-
nities and shopping choices that oth-
ers in the’[Los Angeles] area enjoy.”

Imagine the nerve of a small
group of concerned citizens inform-
ing their fellow citizens about immi-
nent danger to their local vibrancy.
Imagine keeping Wal-Mart from
absorbing possibly upwardly mobile
jobs that offer -the chance to join a
labor union. How dare those upstarts

V — insidious “special interests” like

family businesses prevent
Inglewood residents from having
one giant monolith dominate their
shopping choices? ~

Wal-Mart turns real cities into
company towns. Most of the locals,
after having their mom-and-pop
options eviscerate'd, will have to get
jobs at Wal-Mart, where they won’t

There are a million reasons to enjoy life

A friend of mine killed himself a week
ago. I call him my friend even though we
haven’t been close since college led us to
separate towns. I call him my friend even
though my efforts to help him resulted in
his girlfriend nearly beating me up. I call
 r_ny_fn'end even though he was on a
dizzying downward spiral, the kind that
healthy people. get the hell away from
before they’re pulled into the explosion.

For my own sanity, I cut
him off, as I’ve had todo with
others over the years.
Regardless, I call him _'_ my
friend because he was a per-
son who, despite his ﬂaws,“
always acted with the best /
intentions and never lost his
innate warmth and.kindness.

He had a terrible heroin, I
addiction, the devastation of .
which makes me wonder if
mocking After-School-
Specials and guidance classes ~-
is as simplistic and misguided as the drug
war itself. There are legitimate reasons
why certain drugs should be kept out of
people’s hands. Some things have a pull
on us that we just can’t shake, even when,
in desperation, we try to get away. There

are’ a myriad ‘of addic-tions and self; v

destructive tendencies everyone struggles
with in life. I

, I cannot describe the deep sadness I
feel- knowing that, during the same week
of my 21st birthday, while I passionately
and gluttonously celebrated life, my friend
recklessly and senselessly chose to
embrace death

This is not solely about drugs. This is
about anyone who feels suicide is the only
possible cure for his or her pain.

There are many out there right now
who are thinking of doing the same. I can’t
bring my friend back. But as I said after I
learned of his death, “I don’t want to get
any more phone calls like this.” I’m not
sure how to prevent it from happening, yet
I have hope that some people on the verge

can be saved.
I feel the need, despite the fog of loss

, that hovers over me these days, to express

and experience the full impact of life in
honor of him — perhaps to set an example
to those at risk of his fate. It can be
shrugged off as trite, but there is just so
much to live for: the ﬁrst warm days after
winter, the perfect mix tape, long kisses,
epic daydreams.
‘ These are a few of the
millions of reasons I’m so
glad" to be here in the world.
In a life packed with these
small joys, there is little room
for the bad and the ugly. We
all have them, don’t we? Can
immersion in all of the things
that make us grateful‘ to be
alive equalize our messes
and failures? Or, more ideal-
istically, can they eventually
counteract them? If it is pos-
sible, how do we convince
those without hope to give it a try? .
Damned if I know. In our efforts to
protect my friend from himself, my
friends and I took very different actions.

None worked. Now we all wring our
hands, checking for blood. -The guilt _

remains when there should be peace. It’s
hard to accept that there was nothing left to
be done. Such hopelessness seems like
giving in, just like my friend did. So we
choose to blame ourselves and remain
active. -

My friend lost touch with all of the
good inhis life. The rest of us still remem-
bered it. The many people at his memori-
al, despite any past cynicism, still believed
in him — otherwise it wouldn’t have hurt
so much to say goodbye. I wish he could
have known that. I wish he had felt that for

. himself.

Rumi says there is a secret medicine for
those who hurt so bad they can’! hope. If
you know where to ﬁnd it, spread the word.

It’s really OKthat ladies and gents are different

Unless you live under a rock, or perhaps have been
ﬁxed to a barstool at Cumpie’s for any length of time,
you should be well aware of some grave
differences between guys and gals.

For those of you rock dwellers and
Cumpie’s frequenters, allow me to clue
you in: Men and women are of different
breeds entirely — and I’m not talking
simply in terms of anatomical design
alone. _

Chicks get a bad rap. We’re pegged
as catty and two-faced ---stereotypes that
reality shows like “The Bachelor” and
“The Real World” don’t do a heck of a
whole lot to alter.

I can’t say that these labels are nec-
essarily false, either. Even as a female
myself, I’ll be the first to say that my tolerance for
chicks is minimal — there is far too much unnecessary
drama and far too many petty conﬂicts for my easily
agitated character to handle. I frequently consider the
fact that between my mother, my sister and me, dear ol’
Dad deserves a medal. The poor guy has been sur-
rounded by feminine insanity for the past 24 years.

Although he’s a seasoned veteran by now, on occasion I.

can catch him with a look of sheer perplexedness on his
face as our house is_ turned completely upside-down in
the catastrophic event that one of us girls can’t find our
specific hairbrush or personal eyelash curler. '
Or worse yet, he weathers the storms of the blood-
curdling screams that emanate from our bathroom when
one of us has the audacity to commit the cardinal sin of

We may be indistinguishable,

  

Colleen il3ayus

Columnist

-not replacing an empty bottle of conditioner in the

shower.

We gals have our share of problem
areas, but guys, putting up with your gender
ain’t exactly a day at the beach, either.

I think the most striking dissimilarity
between men and women is how they handle
conﬂict with one another. When chicks get
pissed off at each other, generally we just
make snide comments under our breath or
ignore the gal pal in question for a few days,
all while keeping our other girlfriends up to
date onthe dispute at hand. No physical harm
done, no hospital visits to report — just good
old, healthy silent treatment.

Dudes, on the other hand, are perfectly
willing to bash in each other’s faces, and slam
each other around, resulting in bruises, scars, or worse.
I wouldn’t say this had I not been an eyewitness to such
“macho” behavior on multiple occasions. There is a
group of guys that I hang out with here and there, and

every time I go to their place, without fail, Wrestlemania

ensues. If one were to glance around their house, one

would think that it was carefully decked out with the '

requisite collegiate ‘posters of their favorite beer and
half-naked chicks. Do not be deceived. Each one of
these posters has been strategically hung not only for its
aesthetic quality, but to mask all the holes and gashes
that have been created by them hurling each other
through the walls because, heaven forbid, one called the
other a (insert favorite degrading insult to women here)
while under the inﬂuence of one too many shots of

Banker’s Club vodka.

The most fascinating part of such maniac behavior
is that five minutes after the noses are broken and jaws
have been popped back into place, tl1ey’re back to being
best friends again, chugging beer and playing darts
together. There’s no “pissed-off time” allotment; it’s just
a black eye or two, and all is forgotten. While this type
of behavior is as foreign of a concept to me as trying to
read Arabic, maybe something can be said for this male
behavioral pattern. I I

There are certainly no grudges held, and no bridges
are burned. It is a quick and efﬁcient means of letting off
steam. The friendships in question are automatically
restored. . _ l

A suggestion might be that girls try this method of
tension relief, but from what I’ve seen, we just pull hair
and scratch each other. It’s not half as intense or,'excit-
ing as a right hook to the kisser, and is typically only
seen on classy television shows like “Jerry Springer.”
Afterward, there’s still the whole silent-treatment factor.

It’s acceptable that ladies and gents are different.
That’s just how it is, and how it’s supposed to be. Chicks
may get in petty arguments, but it’s not worth getting a
black eye over. After all, it would mess up our make-up
routine.

The closest Colleen Bayus ever came to being in a ﬁght
was when her sister gave her a black eye the day before
she was to be an angel in the church play. Don ’I worry,
she got her back years later when she returned the favor
by breaking her sister’s nose. E-mail her your “Fight
Club” tales at cab2357@pitt.edu.

but we aren’t interchangeable

I’ve been doing a lot of learning
in the past week or so.

Not because I’ve finally figured
out how to stay awake in class, or
have even started going to class for
that matter — I’m just as clueless
about the struggles
immigrants in France and how to
write in German, in the subjunctive
tense, I as I was last month.

What I’ve learned, like most of
what is actually important, was
waiting for me in that nebulous
space known as the real world.

In hanging out with my 15-year-
old brother, who spent the weekend
here, I’ve figured out more about

my family than I had in the -past 18.

years.

The four of us are no Brady
Bunch, but I’d say we get along
remarkably well.

Maybe it has taken some time
away from home for me to realize
this, or maybe it has only become
clear with my brother’s ascent out
of childhood, but now I know why
-— we’re allthe same person.

Never before have I noticed
how often my brother borrows
phrases and gestures from my dad.
He got his sense of humor from my
mom, from whom I have takenmost

of Turkish,

of my methods of dealing with peo-

'ple.

Seeing as how plenty of our
family’s elderly folk accidentally
call me Arlene and marvel at how
young I look, that isn’t all I’ve got-
ten from her.

Aside from .
unquenchable loves for
dessert and people-
watching, it’s tougher to
pinpoint what I have of
my father's, but I know
it’s there, in spades.

I can hear some of my
own attitudes ~ and
philosophies, when my
brother talks. ’/ Even
though he’s younger, I’m
willing _ to bet I’ve
absorbed some of his per- ' ;
sonal disregard for '
authority figures.

Truth be told, this is definitely a
trait he got from my dad ——- and a
trait he is now using against my
authority-figure father. .

It’s doubtful that I would recog-
nize this so clearly if I hadn’t had
the chance to watch_ another family
in action Monday night. On this
first night of Passover, I found
myself in a friend’s home partici-

    

Emily Kaufman
‘Columnist

lpating in a Seder that was both very

different from- and very similar to
any Seder I have ever been to.

I was surrounded by cousins and
aunts and uncles andgrandparents,
and while I was related to none of
them, there is a reason stereotypes

exist. Multiple people
made sure I had more

drink, asked the same
questions concerning
school . and, overall,

ber of the family. '

“ {Perhaps more to the
point, they treated each
other in ways strikingly
like my own extended
family does. There were
a few extra cousins, and
everyone was a little

taller, but all of the necessary ingre-

dients were present.
While this host family provided

me with a wonderful Passoﬂver, and

while it bears a striking resem-
blance to my own family, I’m not
about to ask them to adopt me. An
important difference was brought to
my attention that night.

There may be no way for an old

lady to identify the lone Phish-head ‘

than enough to eat and ’

-treated me like a mem- ,

in a crowd of emo kids. It is pre-
sumably as tough for a non-Jew to
tell a reform and conservative ser-
vice apart as it is for me to highlight
the differences between various
denominations of Christianity or
Islam. To someone who doesn’t

speak Japanese or Chinese, the two .

may‘?-sound essentially the same.

We ——- Jews, families, college
students, whatever ——- are pretty
much indistinguishable, to ‘the_ out-
side eye. ‘

We are: not, however, inter-
changeable. Jewish Mother 7X will

never be my Jewish mother, no mat-
ter how similar they may seem at _

first. Nor will I ever be my mother,
or brother, or father, evenif we sort
of share a personality.

"Sitting amidst books full of phi‘-
los_ophy and economic theory as I
may be,— it’s the little things" that
seem like the biggest revelations.
As awfully Sesame“Street as I know
it is, we’re all special — and gosh
darn it, I like it that .way.

Game

Final Fantasy Crystal
Chronicles

Developed by Square_ Enix
Published by Nintendo
GameCube

7L‘r7.“ni‘r1/2

When the Nintendo 64 was in
development, Hiroshi Yamauchi,
then the president of Nintendo,
demanded that said system would be
cartridge-based, . effectively giving
the finger to the trend toward cheap-
er, more cost-effective optical

. media: As a result, a cadre of third-

party publishers — including big-
name game houses such as
Squaresoft and Capcom — proceed-

ed to give Nintendo the finger right’

back. Then they took their stacks of
revolutionary games — such as
“Final Fantasy VII” and “Resident
Evil” — straight to the up-and-com-
ing PlayStation console. The result-

ing shift in market dominance has
_yet to be overturned.

However, with the unstoppable
popularity of the Game
Advance and development of the
DVD-based GameCube, several of
those developers have since been
making their return to Nintendo.
Square Enix, in particular, recently
made their peace, with “Final
Fantasy Tactics Advance,” a must-
have in the rapidly expanding GBA

‘way, youfight classic mon-

Boy _

library.

If “Tactics Advance” ,
was the apology, then “Final
Fantasy Crystal Chronicles”_
is the make-up sex.

The world is covered
with poisonous gas called
the Miasma, and you, an
adventurer, are charged with
protecting your‘ village.
Your task is to collect
myrrh, a magical fluid, and
bring it back to town in a
Miasma-repelling device
called the Crystal Chalice so
as to purify the huge crystal
that keeps the miasma away
from the town. Along the

sters from the “Final
Fantasy” series, meet cara-
vans of other adventurers,
and even gamble on heart-
pounding cow races. The
game is)divided “into years,
with some myrrh trees only
yielding their bounty at cer-
tain intervals.

The game’s main point is its
multi-player mode, wherein up to
four players — using Game Boy
Advance ‘systems instead of con-
trollers —— team up against the perils
of the road. While this does require
hardware from everyone involved,
it’s not much to ask. Everyone
should own a Game Boy Advance, if

deﬁes deﬁnitions, exp

ectations

not solely for the connectivity fea-
tured in this game. The purpose for
the requirement is to keep the game
screen free from menus and other
distractions by providing a small
screen for each player to use to keep
track of items, sort his or her com-
mand list, and identify the terrain
and potential threats via radar.
Apart from some
early consternation in
using the GBA as a
controller —— toggling
between the GBA and
GameCube can be
confusing at times —
said frustration soon
gave way to the real-
ization of how fun
having my own menu
screen was. Shouts of
“Cover me, I’m
switching items!”
were frequent, as was
banter about who was
going to take out the
next a goblin.
‘music, which seems
reminiscent of “Final
Fantasy IX,” features
a diverse score that
spans from the upbeat
and cheerful to the
dark and haunting. As
fine as these aspects
are, they havenothing

The -

 

on the graphics.

Everyone knows that the ‘Cube
is capable of powerful graphics pro-
cessing. “Super Smash Bros. Melee”
looked good. “SSX3” looked good.
“Mario Kart: Double Dashll”
looked good. “Final Fantasy Crystal
Chronicles” redefines what I con-
sider “good.” Never before have I
seen such an incredible visual com-
ponent to a video game. Hours and
hours into the game, I saw no clip-
ping, minimal — if any — slow-
down, and some lighting effects that

made the muscles in my jaw seem to ~

take a vacation. Combine that with
unique and quirky character design,
detailed dungeon areas, and flashy
spell animations, and you have a
game so laden with eye candy that
Willy Wonka himself would be put
to shame.

“FFCC” has vaulted to the top of
the list of must—own GameCube
games. In one deft stroke, Nintendo
and Square Enix have repaired their
relations, brought us a phenomenal
RPG and given every gamer every-
where a reason to own a Game Boy
Advance.

Now, don’t you think our little
lovebirds deserve some privacy?
Theyhave beautiful new things —

perhaps an honest “Super Mario’

RPG 2” —— to dream up.

to his guitar work is his solo-
ing, which is embedded in the‘
middle, end and sometimes
beginning of his songs. His
guitar screams as he works
away at every chord progres-
sion, moving through with pre-
cision and grace.

With the release of So, It's
Like That in the fall of 2002,
Bonamassa presented a power-
ful lineup of songs that are the
epitome of blues music. He
pulls the powerful blues into-
nations from his previous
works and mixes them with a
liberating collection of muscu-
lar rock songs. The result is an
album filled with tracks that
have remarkable riffs and
catchy, unforgettable hooks.

By the page of 12,
Bonamassa was already tour-
ing New York with an adult
backing band and had the dis-
tinct opportunity to open for
B.B. \ King at a show in
Rochester, N.Y. During his set,

It was a day filled —-with ups and
downs for the Pitt baseball team".

The Panthers were able to come
up with 14 hits in its game at "local

’ noon, but they stranded 12 base run-
ners andpwere only able to ‘produce .

five runs with all those hits,‘ losing
the game by the score of 9-5. ’ ‘
Senior shortstop Bryan Spamer
led the way for Pitt (17-6 overall). In
addition to solid defense, Spamer

produced three hits on the day, .

includinghis first home run of the
season. _ , ' -
Duquesne’s Luke Taggart was the

difference in the game, belting two’

home runs —— the first of his career ——

including a fourth-inning grand slam. ,

The Dukes jumped out to a. 2-0
lead in the bottom of the first inning
of their home opener, when redshirt
freshman Joe Berletic hit a two—run
single. A

The Panthers responded by cut-
ting the deficit to one when Spamer
scored off a Mike Zambriczki sacri-
fice ﬂy to left field.

_ Duquesne took over the game in
the fourth inning, however, scoring
five runs and taking a 7-1 lead.

ThePanthers trimmed the Dukes’
lead in the top of the fifth inning

ing their lead back to six in the sixth
inning behind another Taggart home
run. ' ‘N

Crew battles through bad weather

ALAN SMODIC ,
Staff Writer

While rainy and windy weather
would keepmost of us indoors for
the weekend, Pitt’s crew team was
again out on the river.

This time, the team was compet-
ing in the ,Occoquan sprints in

‘Occoquan,'Va. _ A

“The weather was terrible, there
were very high winds which made
the river pretty dangerous, but they
held the race anyways,” said fresh-
man rower,William Powers.

Despite the difficulties, the

men’s varsity eight made the finals,
and the men’s’ novice eight placed
first. ' - i
This weekend is
an off’ weekend for
the team, but will
feature‘ the usual
tough practices on
the Allegheny
River to work on
improving their
technique.

“These prac-

. tices are especially

crucial to the devel-
opments of the novice boats,”

 

V explained Powers.

Next weekend, however, new
coach Dan Granacea will lead the
team to the Knecht Cup
in Philadelphia and
look to keep up the
success that the team
has been having.

“Since our new
coach, Dan Granacea,
has joined the team,
we’ve done nothing but
improve every week,”,
said Powers. “We’re"'
expecting big things
next weekend.” ’

 

Lopsidedifinal
may have hurt
TV ratings

 

From basketball to golf, here’s
what’s going on in the sporting
world...

oWhile the NCAA tournament as a
whole produced higher TV ratings
this year than it did last year, the
championship game ’ between
Connecticut and Georgia Tech drew
the lowest rating since CBS began
broadcasting the tournament back
in 1982.

Some believe the low'rating can
be explained by the fact that UConn

led by double—digits early on and

had all but put the Yellow jackets to
bed before halftime. The game

drew a national rating of 11.0 — ~

the previous. lowof 12.6 came last
year. This being only the second
year of an 11-year, $6 billion con-
tract, the folks at CBS have to be
somewhat concerned by the recent
trend.

°Univer'sity of North Carolina bas-
ketball recruit James0n Curry
pleaded guilty to two counts of pos-
session with the intent to sell mari-
juana and two counts of delivering
marijuana.

Curry, who recently became the
leading scorer in North Carolina
state high school basketball history,
was one of 49 students arrested in
early February during an undercov-
er investigation._ A '

It’s another tragic story of a
promising young athlete who made
some horrible decisions. Curry,
who is considered one of the best
combo guards in the Tar Heels’
2004 recruiting class, the mistakes
will end up costing him his scholar-
ship. ‘

, Former quarterback

becomes wide receiver

JUSTIN SCHUVER
The Observer (U. Notre Dame)»

(U-WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind. —
Changing positions is never easy for
a player.

For Carlyle Holiday, it’s been
even more difficult, having to move
from being a team’s starting~quarter-
back to a receiver who hardly ever
saw any passes‘ last -season.

Holiday has been practicing this '
spring as a full-time receiver, com-

‘ pletely phasing out any repetitions at

the quarterback position.
Brady Quinn wrested control of

' the position‘ awayifrom Holiday last

season, andvthe senior knows the
"team is basically Quinn’s now.

“[The coaches and'I] have dis-
cussed everything and if things go as
we expect in the spring, then I think ‘
there’s going to be no need for me to
go back [to playing quarterback],”
Holiday -said. “If any situations
come up, things might change, but
right now, we’re just hoping every-
thing goes to plan.”

Holiday is making the second

major transition of his college
career.

Recruited as an option quarter-
back to run former head coach Bob

rDavie’s offense, Holiday was forced

to change gears to run coach Tyrone
Willingham’s pro-style-based offen-
sive system. ’

“It’s been difficult having to
continuously change roles, but it’s
expected in college sports,” Holiday
said. “Before I got ,here, my high
school coach told‘ me that things can
change every day, and I just tried to
be prepared when things happen and
to be able’ to take advantage of those
opportunities”, ,

Holiday was the team’s -starting
quarterback in 2002, Willingham’s
first season at Notre Dame, and
helped the team to a 10-3 record and
a No. 17 ranking.

He struggled early last season,
howeyer, going 1-2 to start the sea-

son and officially being replaced by

Quinn starting with Notre Dame’s
fourth game of the year against

Rutgers continues winning
streak, prepares for Pitt

TOM GOTTLIEB
Daily Targum (Rutgers U.)

(U-WIRE) NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.
— Beating up on non-conference
intrastate schools has become afairly
ordinary occurrence of late for the
Rutgers University baseball team.
Tuesday proved to be no exception.

After registering sound victories
earlier in the season against both Rider
and Farleigh Dickinson, the Scarlet
Knights (12-13 overall, 4-2 Big East)
blanked Monmouth on the arm of
sophomore right-hander Jimmy Jansen,
5-O.

Jansen, making his second start on
the season, continued the strong pitch-

V ing of the Knights in recent games,

even taking it to the next level.
_ Not only did Jansen pitch effective-

ly, he turned in perhaps the most dorni-

nant Knight performance from start to
finish this season.
Jansen scattered seven hits while

_ turning in a complete-game shutout. It‘

was the first time a- Knight pitcher has

' pinned nine donuts in their opponent,’s.
. row on the scoreboard this season.

The victory extended the Knights’

winning streak to five games, perhaps -

signaling the arrival of a winning streak
similar to the 13-game run that pro-
pelled the team to the top of the Big

‘ East last season.

Jansen retired the side in order in
four of the nine innings, and allowed
only a two’-out double in the seventh.

However, things got a bit scary in
the ninth,’ as the recent trend of letting
teams back’ into the game in "the latter
stages of the contest almost came back
and haunted the Knights once again.

Jansen allowed three straight sin-
gles, loading the bases with one out,

and putting his shutout — and perhaps
the outcome of the game — in jeopardy.
However, Jansen quickly rebound-

ed, inducing pinch-hitter Shawn Ensel --

into a popout and striking out designat-
ed hitter Justin Braun to end the game.

Jansen also exhibited control for
the first time this season. After allowing
eight walks in only four innings pitched
in his first outing on March 17 against
Florida Atlantic, Jansen issued only one
harmless walk against Monmouth.

The offense was clicking. as well,
for the Knights: as the lineup rapped out
12 hits on the day. Junior Jeff Frazier
may have finally returned to form after
a slow weekend ' series against West
Virginia. ,  .

Frazier went 2-for-5, including a
one-out double ‘in the fourth inning
after which he scored on a single from
first baseman Colin Gaynor.

The second baseman continued his
hot play, going 2-for;3 with a pair of

walks. The senior sparkplug’s ability to 1 '
reach base four times allowed Badger

to raise his Big East-leading on-base
percentage to .543. .

Badger’s two-out single in the third
frame plated the Knights’ first run of

the game in the form of center ﬁelder —-

Nick Cerulo.

» This non-conference matchup.
proved to be a tuneup for the Knights’
return to Big East action on Thursday.
They will take on the Pitt Panthers_in a
doubleheader starting at noon. The
Panthers are the owners of a 5-1 confer-
ence record and a 17-6 record overall.

Spencer and Polite improve their possible positions in NFL draft

Walker, page 15

football players Shawntae Spencer
and Lousaka Polite have recently
improved their NFL stock."

Spencer’, who had eight inter-
ceptions as a Panther, had NFL
scouts raving about his speed and
leaping ability. Some say that his
4.48 in the 40-yard dash might push
him all the way up into the first
round.

Scouts say that Polite definitely
has the size and work ethic to be an
NFL fullback, but feel that he is
limited when it comes to speed.
Still, SportsLine.c0m has Polite
rated as the fourth-best fullback in
the draft. ' '

°Former Ohio State tailback
Maurice Clarett took the first steps
toward improving his draft poten-
tial this week. Scouts said that

Clarett turned in a pretty solid ‘per~ . A

formance in his first ful1—scale audi-
tion.‘

His 40 time was clocked in the
4.58-4.59 range, and he has also
lost 12 pounds since his’ first
appearance at the NFL combine.
But without his having played a sin-
gle down in the 2003 season, taking
Clarett in the early rounds would
still be a serious gamble.

°Much to the dismay of Pittsburgh
Penguin fans, the Washington
Capitals won the NHL’s draft lot-
tery. Despite finishing dead last, the
Penguins will now likely not have
the opportunity to draft coveted
Russian forward Alexander
Ovechkin, whom many people’ in
the world of hockey have compared
to Mario Lemieux. I ,
The Penguins did receive some
good news this week, however.
Lemieux told head coach Eddie
Olczyk that, barring a lockout, he
will play next season. ~

°But if Jaromir Jagr’s latest move is

any indication, next year’s NHL

season will likely not happen. Jagr
told the New York Daily News that
he has a conditional contract in
place that will enable him to play in
Russia next fall should the opening
of the NHL season be delayed by a
lockout.

This is the final year of the
NHL’s collective bargaining agree-
ment, and with profits down and
salaries up, many believe a lockout
may be unavoidable. '

°After going winless in the last six
majors, people are looking for Tiger

Woods to return to form this week-
end at Augusta National. Critics

have recently been tough on Woods,

saying that he has not been living
up to expectations.

But high expectations are noth-
ing new for Woods. ‘

The expectations, fair or not,
will likely not be going away any-
time soon. At the Masters this
weekend, Woods, ranked No. 1 in
the world, is the odds-on favorite to
win.

After losing starting job last season, Holiday looking to contribute

Holiday, page 17

Purdue.

With Quinn running the team’s offense,
Holiday began to contribute as a wide receiver,
and received two starts at the position during the
team’s games against Stanford and Syracuse.

Last year, Holiday caught two passes for 13
yards, but also contributed as a blocker on numer-
ous plays.

His role with the team figures to be larger this
season.

“Hopefully we can get him geared up to where
he can focus and put all of his attention on being
a receiver and making a major contribution to our
football team in that regard,” Willingham said.

“Even on special teams, he could be our returner’
—— maybe our punt returner or even kickoff
returner.”

The Irish coaches hope that allowing Holiday
to focus primarily on the wide receiver position
will allow him to «put all of his attention at
improving at the position.

“You kind of have to let him play the wide
receiver,”
Diedrick said. “If you go back and split the two,
it’s not fair, because he’s’not going to benefit and
get the full learning experience at receiver.” '

Holiday was primarily recruited by Davie
because of his foot speed, and wide receiver is the
position where he feels he will be most able to use
those talents.

Irish offensive coordinator Bill,

Former Notre Dame player Arnaz Battle made
a similar transition, starting the 2000 season at
quarterback before seeing his season end due to a
wrist injury in the second game of the year.

He returned to the team in 2001 as a wide
receiver and contributed, but it wasn’t. until his
senior season in 2002 that Battle really showed
his talent. .

Battle led the team in receiving that year, col-
lecting 58 receptions for 786 yards and five
touchdowns.

“[Watching Battle make a similar transition]
definitely helps,” Holiday said. “It also helps that
I’ve been in the system a year longer than he had.

“But to see what he’s.done and what he did to
get there, it’s a big motivation.”
