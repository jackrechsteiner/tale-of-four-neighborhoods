 Though he held a 24-year tenure 4

as Pitt’s chancellor, Wesley W.
Posvar will be remembered‘ asmore
than just an academic.

“He was a giant of our time, a
renaissance man for the ages. My
friend, my leader, my chancellor,”

‘said David Epperson, representing

the University on July 31 at the
memorial service for the 15th chan-
cellor. ' - I
Posvar, for whom the former
Forbes Quadrangle was renamedin
May 2000, served as Pitt’s chancel-
lor from 1967 to 1991, but also
maintained numerous jobs and
achievements outside ._ of the
University community. He died July
27, of, cardiac arrest- — '

Before beginning his career at’

Pitt, Posvar graduated first in‘ the
largest class in the history of the
U.S. Military Academy at “West
Point. His grade point average is still
one of the highest in the a_cademy’s
records. After receiving his bache-

'lor’s degree _in engineering, Posvar

became a command pilot in the U.S.

The lone survivor of a racially moti-
vated shooting spree, Sandip Patel lost
the use of his arms and legs when
Richard Baumhammers shot him on
April 28, 2000.

But the injuries and the trauma Patel
experienced didn’t prevent him from
celebrating the independence of his

‘home country, India, atan Aug. 19 pro-

gram organized by the India Nationality
Room committee and the Hindu Student
Council.

.To kick off the festivities, held. in
the commons room of the Cathedral of
Learning, Patel delivered a short speech
in Hindi on the sacriﬁces people had
made throughout history so that India’s
freedom could be celebrated today.

Then Patel and the approximately
200 people in attendance watched as
dancers, singers, musicians and speak-
ers performed a variety of acts that
encompassed classical, folk and con-
temporary aspects of Indian performing
arts.
Saroj Bahl, a member of the India
Nationality Room committee and chair-
person of the event, worked all summer
to coordinate the program.

“We teH the whole community to
come under one roof,” she said. “We are
so diverse, but we try to bring everyone
together to celebrate this.”

A Indian Independence Day is cele-
brated Aug. 15. At midnight on this day
in 1947, the British Empire ofﬁcially
relinquished power to the Indian

_ National Congress. Jawaharlal Nehru

was sworn in later that day as the coun-
try’s ﬁrst prime minister.

Sajag Patel, a recent Pitt graduate
and former president of Hindu Student
Council, explained that in India, people
commemorate their Independence -Day
by celebrating the country’s cultural her-
itage with parades, music and dancing.

“In the towns and the villages and
the cities, everyone gets together and
there’s just massive amounts of people,”
he said.

The dancers and musicians per-
formed in the center of the commons
room, beneath Indian and American
ﬂags. Booths lined the periphery of the

Monday, August 27, 2001

room, including one from Art of Living,

a nonproﬁt organization founded by ..

spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.
Other ‘booths sold jewelry, crafts, -and
classical and popular Indian music.

The owner of the Kashmiri Indo-
Pak Cuisine vending truck, Vinay
Patidar, and the Prince of India restau-
rant catered the event, featuring
samosas, alu chat, chicken masala and
other dishes. Proceeds from the sale of
food went to a ftmd for Sandip Patel.

Many of the attendees wore tradi-
tional Indian clothing, the women clad
in colorful saris and salwar kameez and
the men in kurta pajamas.

Both Bahl and Ashish Mitra, the
current president of Hindu Student
Council, emphasized that a celebration
of cultural diversity and unity was at the
heart of the program.

“It’s a celebration of different dance‘

styles, different musical styles, contem-
porary as well as classical,” Mitra said.
The dancers and musicians, many of
whom were children or teen-agers, rep-
resented a number of local Indian cul-
tural institutes and academies, such as
Nandanik Academy and North Hills
Sunday School. Performances ranged
from a sitar recital by Vidyadhara
Budhiraju to a dance routine choreo-
graphed by private dance instructor

Sambhvai Desai that incorporated clas- .

sical techniques with Gujarati folk danc-
ing. _ .
Hindu Student Council members
put up posters around campus announc-
ing the event. It was also advertised on
an Indian music program on Duquesne

University’s radio station as well as at .

local temples and in Indian restaurants
and grocery stores.

“I think it turned out well, especial-
ly considering there aren’t a lot of Pitt

students here [on campus] now,” Mitra

said. “But I think we got a really good
turnout from the community, and it
gives them the chance-to come on cam-
pus and see what students are involved
in.”

Bahl said that in the future she
hopes to advertise the celebration more

-heavily and through different venues in

order to give people who are not a part
of the Indian community an opporttmity
to experience a different culture.

Haakon’s love for the down-dress-

Japan’s attempt to launch rocket

:into orbit

TOKYO —— Three times. since
1998, rockets have lifted from launch-
ing sites in Japan in a roar of smoke
and fire, straining for outer space.

A Three times, the rockets have sp1ut-
tered and failed before delivering their

expensive satellites to orbit.

Japan is set to try again in what is
widely seen as a make-or-break effort
for the country’s ambitions to join the
club of nations capable of reaching
space on their own. 1

After a mechanical glitch delayed
the launch, Japan’s space "agency will
try Wednesday to send a 172-foot tall
H—2A rocket into orbit from its launch
pad on a small Pacific island south of
Kyushu, Japan’s southernmost island.

Because the agency is wary of fur-
ther failure, the rocket will carry only
a dummy weight for a satellite, mak-
ing it a $77 million experiment. Still,
officials at the National Space
Development Agency‘ have acknowl-
edged that an unsuccessful launch
could doom their program.

Hunt continues for man suspected

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Just

Suspected in the horrific murders

suburbs of the California capital, the
27-year-old immigrant remains a mys-
tery. .
As the nationwide hunt for the
Ukrainian shoemaker turned fugitive
stretches toward a second week,
detectives struggle with a puzzle ‘miss-
ing far too many pieces.

Language barriers, cultural bag-

grant neighborhoods of Sacramento
County have slowed the search for
clues.

Basic questions remain unan-
swered: questions about Soltys’
motives, his state of mind and his
movements since the Monday when

and lured his 3-year-old son into a »

Los Angeles. Yet even after slashing ‘

the price three times, from $13,900 to
$10,900, he found no takers.
So last week he finally gave up

and shipped the Mustang off to a car
auction, the equivalent of sending an-

old nag to the glue factory. “The thing
would not move,” he lamented.

As Cooper now knows only too
well, the values of used cars and light
trucks have stumbled lately. A slowing
economy and the incentives that auto

manufacturers lavish on new car buy- : 

ers have depressed prices in the used-
vehicle market. Industry analysts say
the downward pressure on prices is

especially intense among __ used‘ cars " ‘

and trucks that are three years old or
newer, thanks to millions of available
late-model vehicles now coming off
leases. V

Accordingto the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics, consumer prices on
used cars and trucks this year have
fallen at an annual pace of 0.9 percent.
This could be the first year that used

car prices have declined since 1997,“ T’

when prices dropped 4.9 percent.
Although prices of smaller ticket
items have likewise dipped, consumer

goods overall this year are up at a 2.8 ' 

percent rate.

DAVE HARTMAN
Assistant News Editor’

Nearly 450 women marched across the Cathedral
lawn last night, swinging lanterns and mentally preparing
for the college career ahead. These freshmen, clad in
skirts and dresses, processed to Heinz Chapel where they
were presented with the light of knowledge.

Then they were told to get a life.

Mary Robb Jackson, a 1974 Pitt graduate and feature
reporter at Pittsburgh’s KDKA-TV, presented the fresh-
man address at yesterday’s Lantern Night Ceremony. Her
remarks focused on leading a well-rounded life, as she
told participants, “Don’t ever confuse life and work.”

“No man on his deathbed ever said, ‘I wish I had
spent more time in the office,’’’ Jackson told the stand-
ing-room-only quorum of freshman women. “So get a
life.”

In the warm room, Angela Costanzo and Rebecca
Richmond ﬁdgeted slightly as Jackson continued her
speech. The two Tower B residents had come to the

were eager to meet new people. _ '

“It makes you feel more a part of the
University,” Richmond said of the ceremony. ’

Many of the night’s speakers focused on that
unity. Citing more than 200,000 alumni from
around the world and more than 200 years of V ..
education at the University, speakers including 
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and Pitt Alumni ’
Association President Sam Zacharias reﬂected
on the light of knowledge.

Nordenberg said the idea of light symbol-
izing knowledge is not a new one. Thinkers
from Plato to George Bernard Shaw have
focused on such an idea, but according to
Nordenberg, Thomas Jefferson’s conceptualization of
light and knowledge is paramount.

Jefferson remarked that knowledge, like light, can be"

passed from one person to another without depleting the

When Pitt freshman Sean
McComb first glanced at the gold
panther pin festooning the breast
pocket of his shirt, he mistook it
for something else.

“I thought it looked like the
Greyhound bus emblem,” he
said. .

, McComb was one of close to
300 men gathered in the com-
mons room of the Cathedral of
Learning last night for the sev-
enth annual Night of the Panther
ceremony, during which the men
were presented with the gleaming
pins, which symbolize strength.

According to Director of
Student Activities Joe Cavalla,
Night of the Panther began as an
effort to welcome men -in the
same fashion that Lantern Night
welcomes and encourages Pitt’s
women. -

The men in attendance were
praised for being part of the class
of 2005, a class whose academic

excellence was trumpeted by "

Vice Chancellor of Institutional
Advancement Carol
Carter noted that the class had an
average SAT score of 1192, three
points higher than the average for
the class of 2004.

President Jessica Zolornij
encouraged the men to explore
their interests by getting involved
in student organizations.

“Join a Greek organization,
student government, or even
Blue and Gold Society,” she said.
Echoing a common sentiment,
she told the men to enjoy their
freshman year, because it would
only happen once.

The evening’s featured
speaker, Robert Randall, the
president and CEO of Traco win-
dow manufacturing and a 1965
Pitt alum, congratulated the men

for being accepted and for choos- .

ing to come to Pitt. He encour-
aged the men to learn about the
opportunities Pi/tt’has to offer and
to learn what they can do to take

Carter. ‘

advantage of those opportunities.

He also spoke about the pit-.

falls the men would face in the

year to come. I 0
Specifically, Randall spoke

about how a lack of structure,

‘ something that he was used to at
Blue and Gold Society»

the military school he’d previ-
ously attended, once caused him
to lose track of his priorities.

In fact, Randall" said, failing
_to realize what was important left
him on academic probation at the
end of his freshman year.

' Randall encouraged his audi- I

ence metaphorically, urging them

,,to, “Eat your brussel‘ sprouts’

first,” and save the good food for
later. ' ‘

In his parting words‘Randall'
reassured the men that the trepi-

dation they undoubtedly felt-

about college was- normal and
that they should choose their
friends well. .

“It’s part of the college envi-
ronment to have fun, but only if
your priorities’ are the right ones,”
he said. '

THE PITT NEWS

Posvar fought for students’ rights

Posvar, page 1

recently left a black-tie dinner party
to bail out 30 Pitt students whohad
been arrested for protesting.

County Chief Executive Jim
Roddey also addressed friends and
family at the memorial service,
attributing much of Western
Pennsy1vania’s success to Posvar.

“His leadership was at the heart
of the renaissance of Western
Pennsylvania,” Roddey said.

Rev. Dr. Harold Lewis, rector of
Calvary Episcopal, delivered the ser-
mon, calling Posvar “a fighter pilot

trapped in the body of a scholar.”

“He had reached out to the least,
the lost and the last in society,”
Lewis said.

Lewis recalled an incident when
Posvar was approached for member-
ship in a club whose unwritten poli-
cy was to admit only white people.
Posvar refused the offer unless a
black colleague would also be admit-
ted.

Lewis made reference to Posvar
sitting on the floor with student pro-
testors in the 1960s and 1970s, to lis-
ten and to “take action on their
behalf.”

“What a remarkable life,”
Roddey said. “Scholar, athlete, sol-
dier, teacher, government advisor,
university chancellor, husband,
father, grandfather.” _

Po_svar’s long-time friend Robert
Shackleton echoed Roddey’s senti-

ments.“It was my great fortune to

meet this man,” he said. “And I shall
not see his like again.”

After Pitt’s alma mater was per-
formed in the church, Posvar’s cas-
ket was removed by Air Force honor
guard. The former chancellor was
buried Aug. 3 with full military hon-
ors at West Point.

Wesley Wentz Posvar:

Perhaps today you will see the letters
WWPH on your schedule. By now, we’re all
familiar with the name —- the Board of
Trustees changed it from Forbes Quadrangle
to Posvar Hall two years ago.

Often when we see building names, we
don’t remember the person behind them
But Chancellor Wesley Wentz Posvar, who
died July 27, should serve as a role model for
future generations at this University, and
whenever we see that building, we should
remember liirri.

Not only did he have many accom-
plishments — from obtaining one of the high-
est grade point averages ever at West Point to
bringingPittoutofnearbankmptcyto
founding the University Center for
International Studies and the University
Honors College — but he also showed how
anadrriiriistiatoratauriiversitycanbe
responsive to students’ needs. /

When he became chancellor in 1967,
many felt he would not last. He began his
tenure during the height of protests against
the Vietnam War, and Posvar was an oﬂicer
in the Air Force. One might have expected
him to ignore or squelch student war
protests, but he didn’t

protest, satontheﬂoorandlistenedtowhat

30 students arrested for creating a disuir-
bance outside of a residence hall.

Throughout his 24-year tenure at Pitt, he
could be seen in the stands at Pitt Stadium
shaking hands and talking with students.
Many even called him “Uncle Wes.” _

While Posvar had a strong presence
around campus, current Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg does not seem to possess the
same accessibility. Many students report that
they have never seen him in person, and
seemingly he has only been visible at events
like Discovery Weekend last October — and
then only greeting potential donors.

Director of Student Activities Joe .

Cavalla was seen walking around the stri-
dent activities fair yesterday, but where was
Nordenberg? Certainly the event could have
given him the oppoitimity to erase the
administration’s image as being cold and
distant-—animag‘ethatPosvarfoughtwith
his actions. If Nordenberg was absent, he
passed up a great chance.

We do feel that Nordenberg has done
great things for the University as chancellor,
like increasing the school’s prestige. It is our
hope that he will be around for a long time.

But does he want people who see the
building that will eventually be named after
him to remember him as just a fund—raiser or
as a chancellor who genuinely cared about
the people a university serves — its students?

No sex in the steel city  

A tale of woo and woe '

The idea of having a “summer of
love” always seemed a little imprac-
tical to me. When it’s hot and sticky
outside, who really wants to be
holding someone’s sweaty hand or
cuddling up to another warm body?

But despite these obvious hin-
drances, our culture has long propa-
gated the notion that summer is an
ideal time for romance. '

We chatted, and I thought there
were sparks. But in the course of the
conversation, he managed to slip. in

“No  actually I’m a missionary
with the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter;-day Saints,” he said, explain-
ing that it was his job to start up
conversations with random people
in various locations, i.e. the bus.

I respected what this man was
doing, but nonetheless, my pride
was hurt. The conversation ended
with him giving me a religious pam-
phlet.

At the end of June I turned 21, a
development that I hoped would
inject some much-needed spice into
my lackluster love life. I threw a
party that many friends attended,
but the most intimate behavior in
which I engaged that night was rub-
bing the backs of male pals as they
threw up in my alley.

Soon 21-year-old me was drawn

The Pitt News investigates some of
the city’s used bookstores

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

From the nostalgic to the col-
lectible to the downright practical, a
used bookstore will always outdo the
high priced, mass produced, coffee
shon-infiltrated ranks of new book-
stores. This is the second of two
pieces discussing various used books
stores inthe Pittsburgh area. So put on
your walrlging shoes, get out yourbus
pass and travel the trails of used books
across the Pittsburgh region; ._ v '

ThreePenny Books, e_1_p82,7 Murray
Ave.   " ‘
ThreePenny Books fills the used
bookstore void in Squirrel Hill that
The Bookworm left a year ago when it
closed after more than 25 years. In
fact, it is located just up Murray
Avenue from the old underground
store, lying in the block between
Giant Eagle and Manor Theater.

_ The store is very student friendly.
The odd hours, 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 11
p.m. Saturday, and noon to 6 p.m.
Sunday, allow students to come in
after classes and on weekends to shop
and sell.

ThreePenny Books
is not a specialty store,
which means that the
owner, Michael
Embree, buys and sells
anything in good condi-
tion. Embree said stu-
dents buying books at
the beginning of a
semester and selling
them back at the end is
a common and wel-
come occurrence.

Plus, ThreePenny
Books also offers a 15
percent discount to stu-
dents with a valid ID.

The small, carpeted shop is so
ﬁlled with bound literary wonders that
bookends aren’t necessary, and the
shelves overﬂow into stacks of books
on the ﬂoor.

“I had in
mmda
comfort level  
where I could
bring m
dog.”

Renovations are almost complete
on a basement that will be ﬁlled with
paperbacks.

But for now, the store is home to a
wide variety of books from fiction,
science fiction and nonfiction, to reli-
gious, self-help and reference._ Some
of the books are new editions, and
others could have been your grandfa-
ther’s.

Eljay’s Used Books, 1309 E. Carson
St.

Amid unique imagery that helps
constitute the South Side, Eljay’s
Used Books sits at the epicenter of
East Carson Street. On this particular
day, seniors of both life and college
walk by in funky sunglasses, and a
bald woman zips by on a motorized
razor scooter. Inside, away from the
street, Eljay’s maintains an equally
individual yet “comfy” atmosphere.

Co-owners Louise Neve-
Richardson and Frank Oreto imagined
this since Eljay’s birth, which will
have been four years ago next month.

“I had in my mind a comfort level
where I could bring my dog,” Neve-
Richardson said. “Where we could
play the music we like. I just wanted
' to be able to play Tom
Waits or classical or
show tunes.”

The employ-
ees even have their
turn to ‘choose the
music.

Not that it’s
important, it’s just
symbolic of Eljay’s
atmosphere; the book-
store is hip, cool, fun
to be in and still seri-
ous and still devoted
to books.

The “Eljay” of
the title is fictional. It
is a combination of “L” for Louise and
“J” for Jason, Oreto’s middle name.
Neve-Richardson has always felt that
two-syllable names are the easiest to
remember.

Louise Neve-Richardson
Co-Owner; Eljay’s Used Books

    . 
ERIC LIDJI/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Eljay’s Used Books offers a comfortable retreat from the harsh realities of non-
academia and the blazing heat of the sun that beats down on the South Side.

Now they like to pretend that
“Eljay” is real, alive and kicking.

“We like to joke and say that the
owner is in Rome,” she said.

Neve-Richardson and Oreto both
came to‘ Pittsburgh from Tennessee,
where they worked together at a store
called Book World. Neve-Richardson
moved to Pittsburgh with her hus-

band, and Oreto decided to come too.

“We knew nothing about
Pittsburgh,” Neve-Richardson said.

They looked all around the city to
find a location for their store but “fell
in love with the South-- Side.”

“I love this part of town. It
reminds me of college, the young peo-
ple are so nice,” Neve-Richardson
said. ,

At 52 and 30, respectively, Neve-
Richardson and Oreto are not neces-
sarily as young as the college students

who frequent the shop. But they do»

both look and act younger, they say,
and that helps their cause because
Louise says the store’s comfort level
comes from personal style.

The location was a surf shop when
they arrived, but is now lined with
ﬂoor-to-ceiling shelves that stretch
from the door, past a sitting area with
odd chairs, like one covered in tie-dye
and a step ladder that folds into a sit-

That’s the way Eljay’s operates,
though. Oreto and Neve-Richardson
aren't the “owners” or “bosses” of the

They allow the direction of the busi-

the books as well as by their personal

So where do they see themselves

“It only ‘took me two minutes’ to

read the book,” Beverly. Townsend
said, “so I can finally say I readthe
book before the movie.” .

Also created from an old residen-
tial building and found only one,str‘,eet
over from Bryn’ Mawr-Vassar
Bookstore sits Townsend Booksellers.

In a-sense, it is still residential.
The owners, Neil and Beverly
Townsend, moved to Pittsburgh and
Henry Street from California in 1991,
where they had been selling books
since 1984. V

When they ﬁrst found the place,
Beverly Townsend said, “It was the
neighborhood eyesore.” But they
fixed it up -‘and now live above the
store with their son.

Townsend’s is probably the cozi-
est of the neighborhood stores. Small
maps and signs explain where each
section of books is located. The walls
are decorated with pieces of nostalgia,
such as an illustration of The Golden
Triangle from Mount Washington in
1904, a ribbon with a photo of Martin
Luther King Jr. with a quote from his
famous “I Have a Dream” speech as
well as a zoning map of the
Monongahela River area.

A small area with no shelves has a
small rug and two rocking chairs for a
little in-house reading.

Townsend Booksellers is the type
of bookstore that not only acquires
their books from people who come to
sell or trade, but they also go out to

find the books. Almost 50 percent of
the books in the store were bought
after making housecalls or finding the
books atjother‘, locations. ’ 0,

But when store owners allow
themselves the option of traveling to
find’; mer_cl_1andi_se, they have to learn

‘quic*k’1y:..-whether a sale willbe worth

their tinieyor not. “You are always
looking for-,that treasure, that you can

_ sell for .$,1‘,0O0,"~’ B'everly__ Townsend

said.,They}§n_ow look for books when-
ever theyfnafvel-; - .   

Once the Townsends decide to
buy books from someone, they then
have to find a way to get them back to
Henry Street. Neil Townsend said that
often they have to carry stacks down
three ﬂights of stairs.

“It’s a lot of physical work,” he
said, “People think that you sit around
reading all day.”

But this is how to make a living in
the bookselling business. Beverly
Townsend points to some books
behind a locked glass cabinet under
the register for proof.

These are just a few of the 50
autographed books they received from
a “secret” source and contain the sig-
natures, of people such as Richard
Nixon and Kurt Vonnegut.

The Townsends have more than
1,000 reference books in their own
collection and often read books that
they have bought to sell. As book-
sellers and bibliophiles, it begs to be
asked if they get atta_ched'to any of the
books. - ’

“Yes,” Neil said. “But you have to
look at a book as a commodity, not as
literature or a piece of knowledge.
Otherwise, you won’t have anything
special to sell.”

halls. Pittsburgh is a crazy city geo-
graphically, and the streets of the cul-
tural district can seem maze-like, even
to someone who grew up in-Pittsburgh.
Saffron said last year Pitt ‘Arts
made arrangements with Port
Authority Transit to run a special cul-
tural bus on Sundays that would take
students directly 0 from Bigelow
Boulevard to several theaters and
museums. But bus service? was erratic,
and there were not enough students rid- -
ing the bus for PAT to continue the
route. This year, Pitt Arts suggests tak-
ing the 500 bus, whichalso runs
through most of the cultural district.

A Last year, Pitt Arts served more
than 19,000 students and sponsored
more than 100 trips. These numbers,‘
up from 3,300 studentsand 20 ‘trips at
the organization’s birth in 1997, are
dramatic proof of the program’s suc-

According to Saffron, Pitt Arts
demonstrates the University’s efforts to
link Pitt’s campus to cultural life in
Pittsburgh. It also reﬂects Pitt’s com-
mitment to the idea of a true liberal arts
education, which has as one of its
major tenets the importance of becom-
ing a well-rounded, culturally aware
person. s ‘

Used bookstores abound

Books, from page 15

you ﬁnd the right book, then there is
one trek that is truly worth the effort,
and a must for anyone looking to save
money.

Next to Ross Park Mall on
McKnight Road is Half Price Books.
The nationwide used book retailers
was created to be a store that can com-
pete on a broad scale with the larger
retail store, while still selling books at
a much lower cost.

The first Half Price Books was
started in 1972 from an old

Laundromat in Dallas from the per-

sonal collections of Ken Gjernro and
Pat Anderson.

They now have 64 locations in 10
states and claim to have recycled 15
million books, saving 600,000 trees in
the process.

More often than not, if you are
taking a literature class with course
books from 1990 or earlier, you can
find them all for about $10 cheaper
than any of the campus bookstores or
new booksellers like Border’s or
Barnes and Noble.

But without a car it is not neces-
sarily an easy trip.

First, you have to take a bus to

Downtown and then pick up the 11A
or 12A at Liberty and Seventh
avenues by Subway Sandwiches. That
will take you to McKnight Road and
Half Price Books.

The six stores chosen for this
series are just a sample of what is
available in the used book markets of
Oakland, Squirrel Hill, the South Side
and the suburbs of Pittsburgh. But
these stories are only representative of
what is out there, and is by no way a
complete list. Check the Yellow Pages

I KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

A winning season for the men’s
basketball team last year may have
helped to keep head coach Ben
Howland at the University a little
longer. ‘ ~'

Athletic director Steve
Pederson announced on Friday that
Howland has been given a two-year
extension on his current five-year
contract,’ ensuring that Howland
will remain at Pitt through the
2005-06 season. _

“I am very happy and excited
about the contract
Howland said. “_Our program is def-
initely headed inthe right direction.
I think stability and continuity are
important factors in the long-term
"success of our program.” .

In just his second season at Pitt,
Howland led the_..Panthers _last year
to a 19-14 record before. the team
made a fairy tale, run in the Big East
Tournament, making it tothe cham-
pionshipgame for the first time in
school history.  A —

The Panthers beat" first-round
opponent Miami,” 78-69, and upset

extension,”

18th ranked Notre Dame in the
quarterfinals, 66-54. Pitt continued
to advance by shocking 17th ranked
Syracuse, 55-54, in overtime to
advance to the finals against Boston
College. I * *

‘Pitt then earned a place in the
National Invitational Tournament,-
its first trip to the postseason in
four years and eighth overall. Last
season also marked the first time in
12 years that the Panthers defeated
four ranked Big East opponents in
one year. ’

This is a turnaround from the
1999-2000 season when the
Panthers went just 13-15 and fin-
ished 11th in the conference, losing
to Villanova in the first round of the
tournament.

Howland came to Pitt afterfind-
ing success as head coach at
Northern Arizona, where he led the
team to the NCAA Tournament in
1998, the first. time in the school’s
history. The Lumberjacks also cap-
tured back-to-back Big Sky
Championships in 1998 and 1999.-

Howland began his coaching

career as an assistant at Gonzaga 1

from 1981-82, and later spent time

PHOTO COURTESY OF PITI‘ ATHLETICS

Men’s basketball coach Ben Howland
has received a two-year extension.

as an assistant at UC-Santa Barbara
from 1982-94.

Other changes surrounding the
basketball team were made earlier
this month when Howland
announced the appointment of
Ernie Zeigler as an assistant coach
and Chris Carlson as director of
basketball operations.

Zeigler is coming off one-year
tenures at Bowling Green (2000-01)

 

d to stay until 2006

and Kansas State (1999-2000) and
also has significant experience head
coaching overseas. From 1997-99
he was head coach for the Al—Hilal
Sports Club in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, after leading the Henan
Wildcats the year before. Zeigler
was named the Chinese National
Basketball Alliance International
Coach of the Year in 1997.

Carlson joins the staff after
serving as an assistant coach at
Northern Arizona from 1998-2001.

He previously served as an assistant‘

at UC—Santa Barbara from 1994-98
and at Dos Pueblos High in Goleta,
Calif., from 1991-93. -

With the new Petersen Events
Center scheduled to open this sea-
son, the extension of Howland’s
contract, and the addition of Zeigler
and Carlson to the staff, the future
appears to be bright for Pitt basket-
ball. _ -

“He has done everything we
could have hoped for in putting this
basketball program on solid foot-
ing,” Pederson said. “We are very
excited about the future of this pro-

gram with Ben Howland at the

helm.”

the Pitt football team suddenly has a question mark at
the quarterback position. Strong performances in two

‘scrimmage games by Rod Rutherford has closed the

gap between him and starter David Priestley.

ers.

Always beware of fuzzy, orange mascots

This summer I found myself back

home in New Jersey, and as usual, my life
was ﬁlled with sports.
A I had surgery on my foot the first
week in May and had a non-walking cast
up to my knee for six weeks. During this
time I did a lot of vegging on the sofa
while I watched the Devils destroy one
opponent after another before they
destroyed themselves. I wore my home
jersey when they played at home and my
road one when they played on the road. I
was convinced that if I wore my Petr
Sykora jersey, he would get the game-
winning goal.

I had my friend (who happens to be
an art major) draw a big Devils logo on
my cast. It was pretty cool and I certainly
got a lot of attention — both positive and
negative.

Also adorning my cast were a slew of
other sports decorations. Of course there
was a “Go Pitt,” and I had to have a “Go
Mets” even though they’re not exactly
doing too well this season. My best friend
goes to Texas A&M, so when she got a
hold of the markers, I ended up with a
huge A&M logo. She also drew a long-
horn (for their rival school Texas) with its
horns broken off along with the slogan
“Saw em off.” Naturally we put a» big
“Penn State sucks” right on the bottom. I
got a lot of stares for that.

 

POLLUTERS AE KILLING
US !

I did an internship at a local TV sta-

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Gerald Hayes, Pitt’s starting .

strong side linebacker, is soft—spoken
off the field. He is anything but while
on it.

V The 6—foot-3-inch, 245—pound
junior started making noise last sea-
son, leading the team with 104 tackles.

This season he hopes his play
leaves a lot of heads ringing, and some
people are already getting the message
loud and clear.

Street & Smith’s has him as a pre-
season Honorable Mention All-

American. The Sporting News picked

THE PITT NEWS

him as the N 0. 9 outside linebacker on

the national level, but Hayes tries not B

to get caught up in the accolades.

‘ “I was excited [about the awards],
b.ut I kept it inside,” said Hayes, a 20-
year-old administration of justice
major. “Of course you’re going to
think about it, but Ijust took it and
never looked back. I’m just trying to
look to the future.”

Hayes said he got into football for
one reason——to be around his friends.

That simple reason‘ translated to "

an exceptional high school career at
both the running back and linebacker
positions. During his senior year, he
led Passaic Tech to an undefeated sea-

son and a New Jersey state title.
Hayes burst onto the scene last
season during Pitt’s win over Bowling
Green. He came off the bench to
record eight tackles, including two for
a loss. From there he started every
game for the rest of the season, includ-
ing the lnsight.com Bowl. Big games

I for Hayes included his performance of

11 tackles and one sack against
Rutgers and his season high 16 tackles
at Syracuse.

After the season, he made_the All
Big—East Second Team and was one of
only four sophomores to earn such
league honors.

Determined Hayes ready to terrorize on defense

Blackwell said the main reason Hayes
experienced such success in only his
second year in the program was his
work ethic.

“Gerald takes things very serious-
ly, and he’s into what he does,” said
Blackwell, a second-year coach.,“He
attacks things. He has a suddenness to
him, and he’s a real physical player.”

Blackwell, who is largely credited
for the quick progression of Hayes,
said Hayes’ seriousness isn’t left on
the field.

“He takes care of business in the

classroom, and he’s one of those guys
who’s a lot more mature than his age,”
Blackwell said.

An ankle sprain hampered_Hayes
during spring drills, an injury that
forced him to miss the last two weeks

of the camp. Blackwell said Hayes is’

starting to get back to the level he was
at last year. " . ,
‘‘He’s a little bit rusty, but he’s
where I thought he would be,”
Blackwell said. i I v ‘
‘‘I’m just trying‘ to learn my

assignments and doithe best I can do '

' in camp,” Hayes said. I "
But Hayesis eager to get back on i I

parwith a ‘very good defense, which _

only lost one starter from last year.

“Guys like " [Ramon Walker and ' 

Bryan Knight] bring out the best in

. you,” Hayes said.

“We’ve been through" a lot’ togeth-
er, and so far, we’ve been strong.
We’ve got some young guys coming
in, and everything is looking pretty
good for us right now,” Hayes, said.

He said he owes so much to '

es.

“All of them have been a real big
help. They’»re teaching us, not yelling
at us. They stay on us and make sure

. we do what we’ve got to do.” 1 
V _ When all is said and done at the ,_

end of this season, Hayes wants his 
"success measured less in terms of
, awards and more in terms of the tenac-

ity with which he played.

“I just want to look back andsay I 
gave it my all,” Hayes said. “As_ a 

whole defense, wexleft it all on the 
field. We just want to continue ,domi- ‘

Aug. 22 fall camp scrimmage -

The second and ﬁnal scrimmage of
the fall saw 13 Pitt players sit out

because of injuries.‘Some key names on
the injured list included defensive line-
man Joe Conlin (precautionary), run-
ning back Mike Jemison (head), offen-
. sive lineman Joe Manganello (knee),
fullback Dustin Picciotti (head), full-
back Lousaka Polite (ankle) and defen-

With both fullbacks Picciotti and

runner for the starting running back
position. Kirkley rushed for 53 yards on
only six carries. Malcolm Postell is the
other candidate for running back, but he
only rushed the ball nine times for 16
yards. After the game, Kirkley
expressed his thoughts on the possibility
of being the starting running back to
open up Heinz Field.

“I think about it every play, every
practice,” Kirkley said. “'Fhat’s what
pushes me. I need something to moti-
vate me, and this is deﬁnitely motivat-
ing me.” ’ p _

Once again, Rutherford and Bryant
stole the show on offense. Rutherford,
closing the gap between Priestley and
himself as the starting quarterback, Went
nine for 16 for*142 yards and two touch-
downs. ‘

“I think everyday I get a little more
of» an understanding of what coach
wants from me,” Rutherford said. “I got
to continue to believe in him and he will

‘continue to believe in me.” , .
Not only did Rutherford throw for.

two touchdowns, but he also rushed for
two touchdowns and ran for a total of 15

yards on 12 rushing attempts.‘ When I

asked if Rutherford had a chance to.

overtake Priestley as the starter, Harris

said ‘anything is possible.

“I haven’t decided on it yet,” Harris
said about the starting quarterback posi-
tion. “He [Priestley] should be the
sta'rter.bec‘ause he has ﬁve years of
experience, but time will tell.” _

On the receiving end, Bryant caught
seven passes for 158 yards and two

touchdowns of his own. Lamar Slade ’
"also pitched in with a touchdown on one

of his three catches for 63 yards. Yogi
Roth, a freshman wide ‘receiver, also
assisted the Panthers_with four catches
for 37 yards.

“I give myself an A—minus so far in 2

camp because I missed two practices
-with a foot problem, so I don’t get an
A,” Bryant said. “We are agang of dogs
out there. The defense thinks they -are
dogs, but we are dogs too.”

Again Priestley started at quarter-

back. He went six for 12,’ passing for.‘ I .
135 yards and a touchdown. Third— --

string quarterback Pat Hodemy also saw
some playing time and went six for eight

for 60 yards. While all three quarter- I_,
backs were in the game, many times the V
V offensive line would "jump too soon, or‘ r
the quarterback would be forced to call , V
a timeout. This worries Harristhe most 3 3

about his team. ‘

“A little rocky for sure on offense,” ~ 7 _
Harris said. "‘Too many mistakes, toov‘i-5
-many jumping offsides. We have a long 
way to go, and there is no way we 
' should be walking into this opening gf‘
