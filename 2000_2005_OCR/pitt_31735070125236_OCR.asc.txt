phase of Pitt’s largest fund-"raising campaign to date.
Discovery Weekend, a series of campus events for more than 1 ,5 00
invited alumni, donors and friends .of the'Univer_sity, will culminate

he University’s fund-
raising campaign,
. which began with its

“quiet” phase July, 1, 1997, is
launching its “public” phase this
week. Typically, major fund-
raising efforts.attempt to reach
at least half the overall goal be-
fore going public.

‘ Pitt’s campaign is expected

9 to run through June 2003, ac-

cording to Carol A. Carter, vice
chancellor for Institutional Ad-
vancement. Carter gave an up-
date of the campaign, including
a recap of last ﬁscal year’s cash
support, to the University Sen-
ate budget policies committee

L (BPC) Oct. 13.

She reported the amount of

committed money to date and _
' ' the campaign’s total goal to BPC,

but declined to announce the
numbers publicly. (Carter later
declined’ to_comment on pub-
lished reports that the goal was
$500 million.) She said the ofﬁ-
cial announcement will ‘ come
Oct. 28 as part of Discovery
Weekend. —
“We’re going to be disci-
plined in reporting funds for this

campaign,” Carter said. “Every

"pledge is locked up by’ a signed
agreement of the” donor and the
University'before we count it.”
Carter said Pitt’s FY 2000
cash support set an all—time
record at more than $82 million.
Of that amount, annual giving
fund donations totaled
$12.7 “million and capital gifts
added up to about $69.3 million.
“That counts cash and charitable
—  only. No sponsored research
is included in the $82 million.”

Carter said total giving has

been on the upswing since 1994,‘

including a 24.6 percent increase
between FY 1999 and the re-
cently completed ﬁscal year.
“Our rate of giving is accelerat-

ing about twice the rate of in- -

crease as our peer [American
Association of Universities

‘ (AAU) public] institutions. From

1995 through ﬁscal ye_ar 2000,
we’ve gone up in cash support by
108 percent. Taking ‘numbers

20,000 donors and
potential donors to

invite to the Discovery Week-

sity is offering, free-of—charge.
About 1.,5 00 accepted the invita-
tion. ‘ ‘
According to Carol A. Carter,

— “We like to get the donors closer

to campus to see the academic
programs, and see students and
faculty interact, to get a tangible
sense of what they’re giving to.”
Carter is ‘Pitt’s vice chancellor

The weekend will feature a
group of distinguished alumni
visiting campus. Also part of the
weekend’s events are a state-of-

cellorMarkA. N ordenberg, din-
ners at nearby locations, special
on-campus meals, a laser show
and educational presentations by
Pitt faculty. ‘ ' ”

_ Tickets are required for all
Discovery Weekend events, ex-
cept the on-campus presenta-
tions of two alumni, Pat Croce,
president, Philadelphia 76ers
(Oct. 27, 10 a.m. at 121 Lawrence
Hall), and Nlike Ditka, CBS foot-

ball analyst (Oct. 2 7, noon at 121
Lawrence Hall).

_ Croce and Ditka will be
among 33 alumni sharing their
experiences, accomplishments
and advice with current students.

.The alumni are the inaugural

class of Legacy Laureates, a new
program developed to honor al-
ums for their personal and ca-
reer achievements. They will be
recognized at a ceremony on
F riday.

Members of the group repre-

sent an array of disciplines, in-

cluding business, medicine, jour-

_nalism, law, government, sports,

social services, education and the

' arts. (See page 6.) _
Pitt Chancellor MarkA. N or— '

denberg said the Legacy Laure-
ates program is based on the be-
lief that there can be no better
role models for students. than
alumni who have been success-
ful in their chosen ﬁelds.

“One of the most important
lessons we can share with our
students involves the importance
of setting and striving to achieve
personal goals. These laureates

In an Oct. 24 memo to deans,
directors and department heads,
Provostjames V. Maher said that
for the immediate future he was
“eliminating the separate orga-
nizational boundaries between
Network Services (NS) and

The two divisions were,cre—

Universities
should reflect
ethnic diversity

To the editor: ..

If one of the goals of higher
education is to prepare young
adults for what they will encoun-
ter in the world, we need univer-
sities to be diverse places. Uni-
versities need to allow for a range
of opinion, thought.and study.
But how can there be a range of
opinion, thought and study if
universities are homogenous
places, places that exclude those
who are different from the ma-
jority, especially when that ma-
jorityis lessening with every year
(by 2015 it is projected that 1 in
3 Americans will be nonwhite)?

The United States is not, nor
has it ever really been, a country

 

  
er‘

of one ethnic group. Some may
like to reminisce nostalgically of
days in which everyone seemed
to look, think and act very much
the same, but in reality those
days were dependent upon the
exclusion of millions of Ameri-
cans and thanléfully short—lived.
We cannot afford to have those
days return. The fact is the U.S.
with every decade becomes. an
increasingly vibrant mosaic of
people. The emergence of the
African American, Hispanic and
Asian communities has greatly
contributed to our country’s
emergence as an intellectual,
economic, political and cultural

   

powerhouse.

If U.S. universities do not re-
ﬂect the ethnic diversity of the
world, will students be prepared
to effectively participate in the
global economy? If students see
the world as primarily made up
of people very much like them-
selves, will they be prepared to
encounter the burgeoning Afri-
can American, Hispanic and
Asian communities? And as these
ethnic groups become increas-
ingly prosperous, will such stu-
dents have the cultural tools
needed to interact on an indi-
vidual basis with a person of a

UNIVERSITV SENATE

 
IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

 

At both the FacultyAssembly and Senate Coun-
cil meetings this month, I mentioned that some
subjects that were to come before, or had recently
come before, Faculty Assembly and Senate Coun-
cil had been prompted by ‘communications re-
ceived from faculty, including several expressing"
concern about the performance‘ of some Univer-
sity function. I said that I welcome such commu-
nications, and I went further, saying that members
of the University community should not be reluctant to bring
apparent problems to the attention of the University administra—_
tion directly so that it can respond to them, if they truly exist.

At the Senate Council meeting one faculty member referred
to himself as a “squeaky wheel,” having raised problems with the
operation of Courselnfo at the Faculty Assembly meeting at
which an administrator was present. He remarked that the next
day he found that Courselnfo functioned considerably better.
He said that the “squeaky wheel” had been “oiled.” Provost
Maher responded that, while there had been some almost imme-
diate improvement because of some changes made, the basic
difﬁculties with CourseInfo’s functioning were far from being
fully resolved.

I There should be no reservations on the part of faculty and
other members of the University community about ‘being
“squeaky wheels.” By describing a problem in a public forum, or
by communicating about it with an administrator who possesses
responsibilities in the particular area, the “squeaky wheel”, is
performing a desirable, if not essential, function in our large,
bureaucratic organization. In_ many circumstances, the only
method by which individuals with administrative responsibility
can learn that something is amiss is from complaints. Therefore,

 

, those who encounter problems in‘ performing their. duties be-

cause of deﬁciencies in the way that some part of the University
support structure is functioning should inform those with ad-
ministrative responsibility for the personnel and/,or equipment
apparently responsible for the problems. VVhether the problem

is one in a highly professional or technical area, such as the T

operation of the computer system, or the basic maintenance task
of replacing burned-out light bulbs in _classrooms, the individual
affected should contact the responsible administrator. Moaning
about the problem to colleagues doesn’t address the problem;
the sooner the individual responsible for-the function not being
performed is notiﬁed, the greater..th¢.lil<_e1ih.o9d that the. P.¥.0b-.
lem will be addressed,.and eliminated. ' '

It is also worth discussing what the. response of administrators

‘should-be when problems in their areas are brought to their

attention. I know that- I am not alone in having encountered
hostile responses when making the existence of problems known.
Some in management view the making of a complaint as consti-
tuting a problem for them, rather than the failure of them-or their
subordinates to properly perform the function that has precipi-
tated the complaint as the problem upon which to focus. As I see
it, the role of those in University management, responsible for
providing services and support to faculty and other members of
the University community through the’ personnel and equip-
ment assigned to their responsibility areas, is to view those they

. serve as consumers. Effective functioning of personnel and

equipment within their responsibility areas is necessary for the
successful performance by those dependent on their services.

Consumers certainly should feel free to express their views about A

the quality of services they receive, and are entitled to prompt
and courteous responses.

My thinking along this line brought me to the question of-
whether, if at all, the senior University administrators solicit the »
views of the consumers of the services provided: facilities main-

.tenance, campus security, food services, and in the areas closely
related to instruction and research, such as computer and library
facilities and services.. Consumers may be inclined to praise as
well as criticize, if their opinions are sought. For example, I
recently received very useful assistance from a Hillman, librarian.
I probably was remiss in not promptly sending some communi-
cation to Rush Miller, stating my great satisfaction with the
assistance rendered to me. I encourage others in the University
community, when they have been the recipients of excellent
service, or have seen excellent performance by an individual, to
make note of that in some way, so that the employee’s supervisor
will be aware of that employee’s level of performance.

I opened by talking about the “squeaky wheel” and the
attention that a “squeaky wheel” may receive in order to improve
a University function. I think it is equally important that excel-
lent performance should also get attention. Those who beneﬁt
from excellent performance by others should give serious con-
sideration to providing positive reinforcement. I

Nathan Davis seemed fated to be a jazzman. Born
into a musical family in the jazz hotbed of Kansas ‘City,
Kan., in 1937, ‘he rew up two blocks from where
legendary alto saxophonist Charlie Parker lived; the —two
-families knew each other.

Two years later, Davis and a piano—playing friend
won $50 at a local music contest. Davis, then 16, an-
nounced: “Momma, 'I’m going to Chicago” to play
professionally in clubs. “VVhat? You haven’t ﬁnished
high school!” his mother protested. But Nathan was on
ﬁre with musical ambition. “My mother wiped the tears
from her eyes,” he recalls, “and the.next day I was in the ' I \ ‘
back seat of a Greyhound busto Chicago.” He landed a University Times: If somebody had told you in

when Pittsburgh—born drummer Kenny Clarke invited up from Florida just for the [concert] weekend, then he’s
him to play at Paris’s famous St. Germain des Pres jazz
club. Davis went on to perform with Art Blakey, Donald
Byrd,'Erroll .Garner and Dizzy Gillespie, among others.
He also composed and arranged for French radio and
ﬁlms, and founded the jazz studies program at the Paris
American Academy. —~ ' ‘ 

In 1969, after doing graduate work in
ethnomusicology at the Sorbonne, Davis accepted an
offer to ‘direct Pitt’s new jazz studies program. He
subsequently earned a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from
Wesleyan University in Connecticut. In‘ 1970, Davis
founded Pitt’s Jazz Seminar and Concert.

The annual event will celebrate its 30th anniversary
Oct. 30—Nov. 4 with a line-up‘ of internationally re-
nowned jazz greats, free lectures and seminars, an out-
reach program, a display of African and Caribbean art,
and the climactic concert at Carnegie Music Hall in _

, California, all over, reserving tickets. That we would
develop such a loyal following never would have crossed
my mind 30 years ago.

How did it all begin? ,

I’d been a faculty member here for a few months
when I heard, in 1970, that Art Blakey’sJazz Messengers
were playing at the Crawford Grill in the Hill District.
I had toured Europe as a member of theJazz Messengers
in 1965 . Art found out I was in ‘Pittsburgh and phoned
me. “Bring your horn down and play with us,” he said.

I always say the idea for the Pitt Jazz Seminar and
Concert was born on the Crawford Grill stage. Art was
kind of a father ﬁgure for me. After practically every
song we played, he would tell the audience, “That’s my
tenor sax player, Nathan Davis. I trained him, and now
he’s teaching up there at Pitt. I want you all in Pittsburgh

_ to get behind Nathan ’cause he’s-one of us and we’re so
proud of him.”

This year’s event is dedicated to the late Grover
Washington Jr. The famous saxophonist died last ‘De-
At intermission, Christine Washington will accept post— help me out,‘ how about coming up to the school?” He

“Let’s create a committee representing different areas of
the University —— Student Affairs, the public relations
office and so forth — so it’s not just a music department
thing,” and that’s what we did. 9 9 r

In 1970, the idea ‘of a professional jazz musician
lecturing at a university... _

Was brand new. The philosophy behind the seminar
was to bring jazz masters to the classroom, so students
could hear from the creators themselves rather than
from somebody with a Ph.D. who studied jazz and read
about it in the library but never experienced it. _

I should point out that the jazz seminar is more than

- just a series of lectures and concerts. -There’s the Inter-

national Jazz Hall of Fame, part of which you see in the
William Pitt Union. The Hall of Fame voters come
from 20 countries around the world. ‘

There are the Pitt jazz archives. We have one of the
world’s most impressive libraries here of jazz masters
lecturing. National. Public Radio has ‘come to us for
tapes of famous musicians who have only taught here at
Pitt,*like [the late]lKenny Clarke.

Since 1993, we’ve produced the International Jazz
Archives Journal, which is considered to be the No. ,1

« academic journal on jazz in the country. And we’ve got
, the William Robinson Digital Recording Studio [in

Belleﬁeld Hall]. All of that comes under the jazz semi-
nar. . s ' _ - .~ -

When ou were comin u it was unusual for a

7 ,_
professional jazz musician to earn a Ph.D., as you
did. — ‘

9 Very‘ unusual.

How did you get into the academic world?
When I was playing in Paris in the late 1960s, I was

approached one night by a guy named Joe Maka, who " S

was fromlGuinea. Joe was a saxophone player and a
student. He said, “I love the way you play. Would you
teach me? ” He was a student and didn’t have any money.
But I had learned from Kenny Clarke that, as jazz‘
musicians, we oughtto be thankful because we make‘
money every night. Not like painters and writers, who
have to wait until they sell a painting or a book. So I said

“to Joe, “Okay, I’ll teach you for free. But you’ll have to

wait until noon or 1 p.m., when I wake up.” I was playing
from 10 o’clock at night to 4 in the morning back then.

I’d give this kid a lesson once a week. After a few

months, he said, “You’ve never

asked me where or what I’m
studying.” He told me he was a
student at the Sorbonne, study-
ing with one of the leading
French ethnomusicologists. He
said, “We are now studying mu—
sic from northern Brazil and
southern India, and it sounds
like the music John Coltrane is
doing.” I said, “No stuff? Hey, I
think I’ll go out there with you.”
It was that informal. I got up one
morning and went to class at the
Sorbonne with him.

When I got there, the profes-
sor and students asked if I would
talk to them about jazz. I said,
“Yeah. Okay.” I’m told that the
Sorbonne still has, in their ar-
chives, tapes of me delivering, in
very bad French, four lectures
about American jazz.

That experience was odd for
me. VVhen I had been working
on my bachelor’s degree in mu-
sic education at the University
of Kansas, they had prohibited
you from even practicing jazz.

One student in Paris told me
he was getting a Ph.D._in “the
schools of the blues.” ‘I’ ‘said,
“VVhatchu talkin’ about, boy? I’m
from Kansas City. We know
about the blues. VVhat do you
mean you’re getting a Ph.D. in

p it?” He explained how he was

doing his research. I thought: If
I ever get the chance, I’m going
to make that kind of study pos-
sible in America —— if I ever go
back. At that point, I wasn’t plan-
ning to return to the United
States. I was in Europe, living
and making‘ money as a jazz

musician. VVhy leave? I stayed A
another year working toward the .

equivalent of a master’s degree
at the Sorbonne.

But in 1969, I talked with Dr.
Robert Snow, who was then the
chairman of the music depart-
ment at Pitt. Snow was looking
for someone to teach jazz. Back
then, with all of the social un-
rest, the riots and so _on, things
were changing and curriculums
were being overhauled. A pro-
fessor at Indiana had recom-
mended to Snow that he contact
me.

"At the same time, Donald
Byrd and Dizzy Gillespie were
telling me I should come back to
the United States because there
was now a chance for jazz musi-
cians with degrees to teach. Iwas
one of the few who had a degree.
So, I ended up accepting the job

' offer from Pitt.

At that time, jazz was coming

, out of an era when a lot of

musicians played freely —— and,
to some listeners’ ears, dis-
cordantly, with no hint of tra-
ditional melody or harmony.
You were quoted as calling
some of these people “artistic
charlatans.”

Iwas referring to those people

NATHAN
DAVIS

who did not have the proper
training in how to play their in-
struments, nor the proper theo-
retical training to be ﬁrst—rate
players or composers. ,

Now, Coltrane played free.
Art Blakey and Freddie Hubbard
played free. I’ve played free. But
we all had the musical nuts and
bolts to be able to experiment.
There were some other people
who said, “To hell with the nuts
and bolts. We’re just going to
play free.” Those were the char-
latans. VVhen jazz started mov-
ing in another direction in the
1970s, those people got left be-
hind because they didn’t have
the tools to go anywhere else.

Students occasionally tell me,

“I don’t like theory” or “I don’t .

want to study harmony.” I tell
them, “Look, a C is a C is a C. A
diminished chord is a diminished
chord. I don’t care what style
you’re playing. Learn theory,
technique, how to play scales and
read music. Learn the history of
mus1c.”

VVhen we look back at the

I 1960s and say thegmusic sounded

chaotic, it was a reflection of the
period. The ‘times themselves
were chaotic. During the late
1970s and ’80s, there was a strong
return to traditional bebop. To-
day, there’s an emphasis on
modal and polyphonic playing
— that’s what most of our stu-

dents want to learn about.
Wynton Marsalis, to his credit, ‘
has incorporated Dixieland mu— :

sic in his playing. I have a lot of
respect for him for doing that.
We in America tend to overlook
the older styles.

Does this year’s event have a
bittersweet quality for you,
given‘ that it memorializes a.
good friend, GroverWashing-
ton ]r.? ‘ ~

People would ask me earlier‘
this year about the nextjazz serni—
nar and I would trylto avoid the
subject. Every time I thought
about it, Iwould think of Grover.
He was such a great person in
addition to being a great musi-
cian. Eventually, we decided to
dedicate this year’s event to him.

’ He once called you his idol,

and you’ve said the two of you
were like brothers. How did
you meet?

I’m a very private person.
Some people may think I’m a
little snobbish, but I’m, not, re-
ally. I just don’t like crowds,
which sounds funny for a jazz
musician. Mostly, I like to stay

‘ home, writing music and prac-

ticing. So, I wouldn’t end up
going to Grover’s concerts when
he’d play in Pittsburgh.

One day in the early ’70s, a
student came to me and said:
“Grover Washington is playing
at the Syria Mosque. He’s with
his band down at the Holiday

 

, CONTINUED FROM PAGE 2

Inn on the Boulevard of the Al-
lies. I was getting his a1ftogra’ph
and told him I was a jazz student
at Pitt and he said, ‘Nathan Davis
— he never comes ‘to hear me
play.”’ This kid told Grover that
he would run up to Pitt and get
me! So, I agreed to walk down to
the Holiday Inn with the kid.
VVhen Grover and I met, we
hugged» each other and Grover
said: “Mr. Nathan Davis! I’ve
always wanted to meet you.” I

said,_“Oh, come on, man.” He ‘

said, “No, no, it’s true!” He went
to his bag and got out one of my
records and said he carried it
with him wherever he went. I
thought, “Wow, this cat’s seri-
ous.” After that, he said, “VVhen-
ever I can do one of your jazz
seminars, I’d sure like to be a
part of it.” I remember when we
first invited him, some of the
other musicians didn’t approve.
They said, “This guy’s more
commercial than serious” be-
cause he’d sold a lot of records. I
said, “No, you get rid of that
prejudice and really listen, and
you’ll hear.” Every one of those
musicians, after that, came back
and told me, “You’re right. This
cat can really play.”

Your lineups are so strong,
does anyone ever play a solo
that amazes even you folks on
stage?

It happens all the time. You’ve

moving the concert to a big-

  
 

got some monsters up there, some
giant musicians. That’s why a lot
of times we look so happy, be-
cause everybody is killing every-
body else, in a nice way.

One’ of the dangers of a con-
cert like this would be to think,
“We’ve got all of these great
musicians. Let ’em go.” But it’s
not a jam-session. Some people
inaccurately call it that, but I
write the charts and it’s struc-
tured. It wouldn’t be the same if
you let the musicians play what-
ever they wanted to play. You’d
have chaos, and egos out of check.

Do the musicians check their
egos at the door?

' I always tell them: “Look, ev-
erybody here is a star, including
me.” With the seminars, I tell
the musicians: “If you don’t want
to dealwith kids, don’t come
here. You’re coming not just to
play in a concert but to talk to
students, too.” I’ve had to
straighten out a couple of guys
who were like, _“Don’t ask me
dumb. questions like that” or
“Don’t take my picture.” I told
them, “Hey, wait a minute here.
You’re not at a nightclub now,
you’re at the University of Pitts-~
burgh.” But‘ a couple of prob-
lems over 30 years is not bad.

Given how the event has
grown, are you considering

 

ger venue than Carnegie Mu-
sic Hall? Or doing more than
one concert?

. No. People ask me that all of
the time. I’m not interested in
doing a series of concerts, say, or
doing it for three weekends a
year.

 How much longer do you plan

to continue organizing the
Jazz Seminar and Concert?
Considering that some musi-
cians have agreed to play here
only because they knew you
personally, there’s concern
that the event couldn’t carry
on without you.

Yeah, I’ve heard that. I don’t
plan to retire any time soon. But
I am 63 years old, and I need to
watch my health and try to mini-
mize the stress. I’m trying to
phase back my involvement; 30
years is a long time. Next year,
I’d like to start doing about half
of what I’ve been doing.

_ Fortunately, I’ve got a great
committee, which takes a lot of
weight off my shoulders. Maybe

-when I decide to get out of the a

way altogether, the University
can get a grant to keep the jazz
seminar going. It would be a.
shame for it to die,jsince it’s built
up so much momentum.
VVhether or not I play an-
other note, my legacy has been
written. I don’t want to sound

Donald Byrd.‘ eft, and Wallace Roney are among the jazz musicians, Nathan Davis has gathered

In the United States diversity

Universities not only need to
accept that fact, but also em-
brace it.

Technology and an interna-

Though it is still four months -

‘a or fun din g
for several capital
campus improve-

ment projects moved a step closer
to approval this week.

The Board of Trustees prop-
erty and facilities committee Oct.
2 4 okayed seven separate projects
on or near the Pittsburgh cam-
pus. ’ C

The committee must approve
all University construction
projects in excess of $1 million.
Upon approval, the committee
informs_ the board’s budget com-
mittee of its actions for the pur-
pose of including the approved
amounts in Pit_t’s capital budget.

The full board, which meets
today, "Oct. 26, is expected to
approve the committee’s recom-
mendations.

Projects approved by the
property and facilities commit-
tee are:

0 Fire alarm upgrades and
sprinkler system installation in
Lothrop Hall ($2.4 million, to
be paid from University auxil-
iary reserve funds)‘;

-0 Renovation of the Univer-
sity-owned warehouse on Tho-
mas Boulevard in Point Breeze

able to develop a systematic plan
to correct each of those prob-
lems,” the provost wrote. I

The memo did, not specify

According to the Provost’s
ofﬁce, the purchase of band-
width, expected at the start of
this fall’s term, has been delayed

due to snarlsin ongoing nego-

tiations with an outside vendor.

The -administration had
hoped to‘ have the bandwidth in
place by early this month. Ofﬁ—
cials in the Provost’s ofﬁce said

_ that the University has purchased

the equipment necessary to dis-

tribute the bandwidth once the

deal is completed. . '
Ofﬁcials also said that Pitt

were working to improve the
Courselnfo system in tandem

with Blackboard, Inc., the soft- ~

ware vendor that owns the

- Maher acknowledged to Sen-
ate Council last month that he
had heard complaintscfrom sev-
eral faculty about Coi‘frseInfo, a
much-used integrated software

package that allows faculty to_

use web pages for instruction.
Courselnfo features tools to ad-
minister, grade and record quiz-
zes, and facilitates instructors’
efforts to send e—mail, transfer
ﬁles to and from students and

manage an on-line gradebook. ‘

About 1,000 Pitt faculty mem-
bers are trained in the use of the
software and the package serves
about one-third of the student
population.

Provost’s ofﬁce ofﬁcials said

Funding for several major campus  
  projects moves closer to approval

ing pipe insulation and improved
heat recovery systems.

The property and facilities
committee further is authorized
to approve purchases, sales,
mortgages, leases or acquisitions
of real ‘ estate in excess of
$500,000. The committee ap-
proved two such projects:

0 The purchaseof the Gold
Building, '3 343-, Forbes Ave., for
additional lab space for the Cen-
ter for Environmental Health
and Toxicology Research, part
of the Graduate School of Pub-

lic Health. Thecost is $2.5 mil- 0

Approval of the Minutes and Report of the Chair

The minutes of the February 22 meeting were approved. Maher reported that there was no new
news on the University's FY 2001 appropriation request, but that there was hope for a modest
increase in the Educational and General budget as well as specially-requested line items. He stated
that the University would likely be ready to move on the new technology plan at the beginning of
the ﬁscal year.

Discussion of the Revenue Attribution and Cost Study Report

Wion reported that few changes were made to the methodology of the report this year, but that
some suggested improvements had been incorporated. He emphasized the potential uses for the
information, as well as the cautions regarding its use discussed liberally throughout the document.
Wion summarized the methodology, noting speciﬁcally the data inclusions.

Among the noteworthy changes in the current report. Wion noted that the special faculty
retirement plan funds were not attributed. He added that the calculations of computing costs utilized
FY 1997 ratios, which it is hoped will be updated in the next iteration of the study. He pointed out
a new line item for regional campus auxiliary reserve transfers, which recognize that regional
campus auxiliary enterprises are expected to produce positive balances.

Maher commended the work that went into the report. He expressed some caution that users
understand the sound reasons for apparent anomalies in the report. and discouraged use of the data
in unproductive ways,

Update of F Y 2001 Parameters Subconrmiaeé Work

Ban reported that the current proposed FY 2001 parameters produce a balanced budget
recommendation if the salary inttease does notexceed 3.5% and the tuition increase is at least 4.0%.
The subcommittee, however, hopes to increase the salary increase to at least 4.0%. She cautioned
that utilities‘ costs are increasing, rather than declining as expected, and added that net facilities costs
are still rising. She indicated that the subcommittee would be meeting in late April and again in mid-
May. « '

Report of the Chair

Maher reported that the University;s appropriation has progressed through the conference
corrunittee, but has yet to reach the legislature. He summarized the message of his recent letter to
the faculty that discussed the need for resources relative to the University's capital plan and attaining 5.
it robust funding level for academic programs and student life initiatives. Maher shared recent data
on faculty salaries at peer institutionsiand noted recent strides in salary levels at the University. He
also emphasized recent gains in freshmen qualiﬁcations (average SAT scores and percentage of
students in the top l0% of their high school classes). ' '

Maher cited the University's recovery from the financial crisis of the early 1990' s, but
cautioned that private universities have “ramped up" faculty salaries, creating a salary gap between
public and private institutions. He indicated that the impact of the recent retirement incentive plan
has yet to be seen on the competitive standing of average salaries at the University among AAU
peers. ,

Discussion afrhe FY2001 Parameters Recommendations

' Ban reported on the recommendations of the Parameters Subcomrrtittee. The Subcommittee
members agreed that a 4.0% salary increase was the rrtinimum they wished to support.’ However,
there was disagreement over whether the recommended salary increase should be 4.5%. which
would be accompanied by 114.5% increase in tuition. and $500,000 each for academic programming
and student life initiatives.

Cooper-expressed concern that increasing the salary increase comes at the costof an additional
-$500,000 in acadernic program funds, which are much needed. He also expressed concern over the '
proposed tuition increase, relative to the potential impact on student quality, overall enrollment, and
accessibility to potential students.

Wion stated that the inﬂation increase in the past year exceeded that of the previous year by

1%.’ Failure to increase salaries by more than that 1% in FY 200lover the FY 2000 increase would _

be a cause for concern and possibly result in slipping in salary comparisons. Wion added that the

 

academic program enhancements line item is not the only source of funds for new-academic

programs and that the proposed 4.5% tuition increase is not unreasonable given recent history.
Maher expressed the desire to move toward permanent improvements and away from year-
to-year “ﬁxes." He cited the wide range of uses of the academic program enhancement funds, front
reducing crowding in introductory-level classes to attempts to double the number of doctoral
enrollments in the Arts and Sciences. He added that increases in tuition rates could adversely affect

, the regionalicampuses and some graduate programs in their competitive positions. Maher stated

that, while he is sympathetic to salary issues, academic needs are greater. He stated that the
University needs a reputation that will allow for full enrollment of good students, encouraging
parents to pay more tuition. » - ' '

,_ A motion was made to accept the recommendation that the FY 2001 parameters include a 4.5 %
salary increase, a 4.5% tuition increase, and-$500,000 in academic prograrn enhancement funds.
Cooper ‘moved to amend the motion to lower the salary and tuition increases to 4.0% and raise
academic program enhancement funding to $1 million._‘ The amendment was approved by a vote of
-'7 to 4 (with one abstention). The amended motion was then passed by a vote of 9 to 2 (with one
abstention). ‘ ’

Ban explained that the Subwmmittee recommended that a 4.0% salary increase be split 24% i

for cost of living, 1.3% for merit. and 0.3% for market/equity. Maher expressed concern that a 0.3%
market/equity increase would have little impact. Ramicone stated a desire fora lower cost of living
increase in order to better address merit and market/equity issues.

Ban moved to accept the recommendation of the Parameters Subcorrunittee (2.4% cost of
living/1.3% merit/0.3% market and equity).-, Williams seconded. Cooper moved to amend the
motion, changing the merit split to 1.2% and market/equity to 0.4%. The amendment failed and the
motion was then passed by a vote of 8 to 3. ‘Z

OCTOBER 26, 2000

began appearing this week in
campus building lobbies and
in mailboxes of alumni, trust-
ees, major donors to the Uni-
versity, community and busi-
ness leaders, legislators, gov-
ernment ofﬁcials and the news
media. _

Campaign Chronicle pub-
lisher Robert Hill, Pitt’s ex-
ecutive director of Public Af-
fairs,_said the 8-page, four-
color weekly will appear each
Monday, 44 times a year at
least for the duration of the
University’s capital campaign,
set to kick off publicly this
weekend. 9

In-the Oct. 23 inaugural
issue, Hill wrote that the Cam-
paign Chronicle’s mission is
to provide the University’s key
publics with “an accurate, posi-
tive, and consistent view of the
University: its mission, its
goals, its stories, its successes,
and its importance to the com-
munity.” .

Pitt already had student
newspapers (The Pitt News,
the College of General Stud-
ies’- First Degree), a faculty
and staff newspaper (the Uni-
versity Times), alumni publi-
cations (Pitt Magazine plus
various magazines and news-
letters published by individual
schools and colleges), fund-
ing the Ofﬁce of Institutional
Advancement’s World of Giv-..
ing) and periodic information
vehicles such as [the
Chancellor’s Updates.

Hill told the University
Times that a new weekly pub-
lication was needed “because

the middle of the ‘AAU public
universities.
‘ Regarding the overall cam-

. paign, Carter said the quiet phase __

has focused on major gifts from
foundations, corporations and

- individuals. The public phase

includes the kick-off weekend,
targeted regional campaignsmand
an annual giving fund challenge.

“Development ofﬁcers will

continue to raise major gifts cen— —

trally, including foundation and
corporate support, just as they’ve
been doing the past three/years,”
she said. “But'we’re adding two
other layers of effort, a regional
campaign targeting 10 cities with

- our largest alumni representa-

tion, to raise our number of com-
mitments at the $ 1 0,000—$5 0,000
level, and an annual giving fund

challenge which will provide A

matching funds for any
[individual’s] increase of $ 1 00 or
more over last year’s gift.”

The matching gifts will come

A from “annual fund challengers,”

selected alumni from each school
who will donate, or -have do-
nated, at least $10,000. She said
she hoped that the matching pool

c_of fundswill reach $250,000

University—wide.

The challenge effort will be
launched next spring, she said.
“It’s human nature to likea chal-

lenge. We want ‘people to get -

into a pattern of multi-year giv-
ing, so we can count the com-
mitments made toward the cam-
paign. It also gets people into the

.. go<2d.ha12itp£.giting.s:x9rx..r€ar.”
The targeted regions include: 1

Pittsburgh,‘ Boston, Philadel-
phia, the New York City/New
Jersey area, Washington, D.C.,
Chicago, San F rancisco,--Los
Angeles, Boca Raton/south
Florida and Naples, Fla.

Mailings and follow—up con-
tact by volunteers in those areas
are expected to target the 20,000
prospects who were invited to
Discovery Weekend, and some
5 5,000 alumni and friends of’Pitt
who are identiﬁed as potential
donors by Institutional Advance-
ment.

Additionally, she said, the
University hopes to maintain an
experienced corps of ' regional
ﬁ1nd—raising volunteers. at the
conclusion of the campaign.

Carter said that among the
sources of money generated by
the campaign, private founda-
tions are the giving leaders.

“Historically, we’ve been be-
hind the curve ofour peer insti-
tutions in corporate and indi-
vidual support, while private
foundations have led in giving to
Pitt,” she said. “Part of that is
attributable to the work going
on here and part because we’re

Pitt ranks in the top 15 na-

Particularly encouraging in
the campaign, Carter said, is the
increase of named endowments

minimum amount for a named
endowment opportunity is

our students of the potential for
excellence that exists within our
University community,” Nor-
denberg said.

The Legacy Laureates pro-
gram will be an annual activity,
with new members to be inducted
each year. . A

“We will build on the foun- ‘
dation of achievement repre-
sented by our inaugural mem-

bers in recognizing future Legacy
Laureates and in continuing to
foster a culture of success for all
those who receive an education
at the University of Pittsburgh,”
Nordenberg said.

The formal induction cer-
emony Oct. 2 7 will be followed
by the weekend’s keynote ad-
dress by the chancellor.

Also on Friday, deans will co-
host dimers for their school’s
alumni at nearby private homes.

Participants will return to
campus after dinner to hear the
political humor of comedianl
impressionist Jim Morris.

A special buffet will cap off
the Oct. 27 events, with a signa-

ture dessert created for the occa- ;

sion by Pitt alurrmus Ferdinand
Metz, president of the Culinary
Institute of America.

The Oct. 28 events include

informal informational presen-

tations sponsored by several Pitt

schools. There are more than 40 V

subjects ranging from e-com-
merce to bioterrorism, from vir-
tual art museum tours to gamma
knife radiosurgery, from human
genetics to computer engineer-
ing.

The Saturday itinerary also
includes a multi-media event to
announce the ofﬁcial-launch of

_-the campaign, complete with

ampaign Sﬂategy

postdoctoral fellowships for
$5 00,000-$1 million and gradu-
ate student fellowships for
$250,000 (seven to date); full
scholarships for in—state students,
$100,000, and partial scholar-
ships, $50,000 (1 16 total to date).

Of the 149 new named en-
dowments, 41 are in the Health
Sciences. The campaign’s larg-
est single gift is $12 million from
the Heinz Foundation. Twenty-
four individuals have pledged $1

million or more.

Gifts in the range of$10,000-1

$5 0,000 may be targeted for stu-
dent resources through the 21st
Century Scholarship Fund,
which. is administered by the
Admissions ofﬁce based on need.
Such gifts may establish a named
fund for undergraduate research
projects or books, lab fees, travel
or other educational expenses in
a selected department. “Alumni
have a real afﬁnity there, be-
cause a lot of them had some
form of ﬁnancial aid when they
were at Pitt,” Carter said.

The Institutional Advance-
ment leader said Pitt’s fund-rais-
ing efforts have beneﬁted from
success on the football ﬁeld.
“We’ve learned from our stu-
dent callers, who say to prospec-
tive donors, ‘We beat Penn State
in ‘ football, let’s beat them in
annual giving,’ that donors re-
ally respond to that,” Carter said.

She said Penn State had the
highest alumni giving headcount
in the nation during FY 1999.
“This isn’t the most amount
given, of course, it’s the highest
number of individuals who gave,”
running in the low—20 percentile
of Penn State’s alumni.

Pitt’s annual giving runs at

A about 17-18 percent of the total

alumni, she said.

Carter said she was optimis-
tic that all the campaign goals
would be reached. “There are
outside factors, such as the stock
market, which are out of our
control. It’s expendable income

' that people give from; we get

very few gifts from equity.
There’s never really a perfect
time to have a campaign. Our
research shows that giving is
emotional, and we can’t predict
that kind of giving.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

here is no sin
  scholarly

“It would be a mistake to think
there is some demon we can kill
and everythingwill be okay” with
scholarly publishing, Provost
James V. Maher said at the Oct.
18 University Senate fall plenary
session. -

The problems go beyond sky-
rocketing journal costs to the
root of scholarship and univer-
sity values, the provost said.

For example, new copyright
laws and reinterpretations of ex-
isting ones threaten traditional
intellectual property rights _ of
universities and individual schol-
ars, he said. And so far, Maher
said, academicians have failed to
address what he called “the vast
new opportunities and serious
new challenges” of electronic
publishing.

But even in the absence of a
single villain to blame for the
current crisis in scholarly com-
munication, commercial pub-
lishers remain major bad guys,
according to statistics cited by
University Library System
(ULS) director Rush G. Miller.

A few decades ago, he pointed
out, American scholarly journals
were published by learned soci-

eties. Since then, a handful of .

European commercial houses —
Reed Elsevier, Kluwer, and
Springer Verlag, among them

, — have bought up 7 5' percent of

U.S. scientiﬁc journals, Miller
said. .

These merger-happy pub-
lishers (“They absorb one an-
other like the old Pac-Man
game,” Miller quipped) earn bil-
lions of dollars annually publish-
ing scientiﬁc journals, and now
have their sights set on acquiring
journals in the humanities and
social sciences, said Miller.

Subscription costs for scien-
tiﬁc journals “are literally out of
control. I’ve been a library di-
rector for 26 years, and the costs
have been out of control for my
entire career,” rising 10-12 per-
cent annu-
ally, Miller
said. “I re-
member a

The av-

said. “The

ence is that,

chased by a commercial pub-
lisher,” according to Miller.
From 1986 to 1996, the Con-
sumer Price Index rose by 44
percent, scholarly monographs
went up by 62 percent, health
care by 84 percent and scholarly

journals by 148 percent, Miller.

said. * . -

Publishers say that as the vol-
ume of scientiﬁc research ex-
pands, they are printing more
pages and must pass. their in-
creased -costs on to subscribers,
Miller said. .

But that does not begin to
explain double—digit inﬂation in
journal prices, he argued. “It is
not justiﬁed by any measure-

ment. VVhat has been shown by A

research study after research
study is that mergers have more
impact on prices than any other
single thing.”

VVhen a publisher spends $3 0
million-$100 million to. acquire
another publisher, it has to make
that money back. “They do it by
raising prices,” Miller said.

As ﬁnancially strapped librar-
ies cancel subs'criptions,he said,
publishers simply hike prices for
remaining subscribers.

“A few years ago, Reed“

Elsevier announced a proﬁt of
40 percent on investments to its
stockholders,” Miller recalled.
“.Th_ey.__ have consciously taken
that ﬁgure down to 2 5 percent

_this year because of the image

problem this created. It created
a ﬁrestorm against that company
in the academic world and they
are still suffering from the bad
image created.”

Miller said it’s no coincidence
that TIAA-CREF, the academic

retirement annuity giant, is a
major Reed Elsevier stockholder: —

TIAA-CREF recognizes a highly

proﬁtable investment when it

sees one. "
The “geometric explosion of

scientiﬁc publication”. is com-,.
pounding the problem of jour-

Patrlcla Nagle/CIDDE

gle villain in  
publis '  

’ ‘ O C
nal price inﬂation, Miller said.
The amount of published scien-
tiﬁc information is increasing by
13 percent annually; 7,000 new
journal articles are published
daily, he noted.

“Most libraries spend 70-80
percent of their journal budgets

on scientiﬁc literature. The num-
ber of journal titles in the sci-

‘ ences in most libraries is 20-30
percent of the total. So, we spend .

about 70 percent of the money
on 30 percent of the titles,”
squeezing out humanities jour-
nals. _ A . _

. While Pitt has canceled sub-
scriptions, the University “has
been insulated a great deal from
this phenomenon,” Miller said,
thanks to generous annual in-
creases in ULS’s acquisitions
budget and shrewd acquisitions

strategies — eliminating mul-
tiple subscriptions among Uni-§ ,
versity libraries; cutting expen— ,

sive, low—use’titles; and forming

journal-buying consortia with’

other universities, among other
things. _ i
“We are a bit of an anomaly.
That’sprobably one reason we
haven’t had a [Senate] plenary
session before on this issue, be-
cause we haven’t felt the crisis as
much here,” Miller said; .
Provost Maher added, “W

are.prou;l thanhere at Pitt, we’.5_Ie-
. done a good job of keeping up

our collections. It’s not easy, and
it has impacted other aspects of
our budget.” 5, 1

But Maher cautioned those
in the Senate audience: “Even if

you’re happy with your library, ,

  Economics

you need to understand that stu-
dents and faculty members at
other universities, who you
would like to be reading your
work, are not able to get to your
work because their universities

are not keeping up their collec— ‘

tions.”

‘He and Miller urged faculty
to follow guidelines developed
by SPARC (the Scholarly Pub-

lishing and Academic Resources

Coalition), a partnership be-
tween the Association of Re-
search Libraries (including Pitt’s

ULS) and the Association of Col- _

lege and Research Libraries.

Through SPARC, Miller 1
~ said, libraries are confronting,‘
commercial publishers and ﬁght-

ing for lower journal prices; cre-

,ating less expensive, alternative
0 “electronic journals; pressing for

technology to guarantee long-

term preservation and archiving '

of electronic media, and defend-
ing intellectual property rights.

SPARC encourages faculty to

(among other things) submit
papers to e-journals and serve on
their editorial boards; explore

The current system of scholarly publishing “is in col-
lapse. It’s just a matter of how many years it will continue,”
University Library System (ULS) director Rush G. Miller
said’ at the_Oct. 18 University Senate fall plenary session,
“Are Scholars Under Siege? The Scholarly Communication S
Crisis.” .

Another panelist, Provostjames V. Maher, said: “I don’t I
know if ‘crisis’ is the right word to describe it, but I think it
is very fair to say that we are faced with both challenges and
opportunities that cannot be met if the faculties of the great
universities of the world today don’t discuss what kind of 9
communication will mediate scholarship in the future.”

5 The idea for the Senate meeting grew out of a historic, ’
by-invitation conference in Tempe, Ariz. last spring, orga-
nized by the Association of American Universities (AAU)
and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). Maher
and Miller were among the conference’s 36 participants,
who approved nine principles intended to guidea transfor-

mation of scholarly publishing.

   

Are printed scholarly jour-
nals doomed to extinction?

University Library Systems
(ULS) director Rush G. Miller
«thinks so. In mostscholarly dis-
ciplines, the transition to elec-
tronic-only dissemination of re-
search ﬁndings probably will
come within the next decade,
Miller predicted at the Oct; 18
University Senate fall plenary

' session.

V Economics will drive the
change, he said. “It"costs.‘rno'ney
to put out a printed journal, over
and above what it costs to pro-
duce the [scholarly] informa-

_tion,”_.Miller noted. “But it

doesn’t cost as much incremen-
tally to publish -in electronic for-
mat if there’s a wide enough dis-'
semination and once the initial

technological infrastructure is 

built.” «

Another potential nail in the A

printed journal’s cofﬁn is the fact

, that scientiﬁc information “must

be very current to be valuable,”
Miller pointed out. " ‘

“It slows things down to get
that information intoa printed‘

environment and distributed,” he '

said. By_ the time cutting-edge
research ﬁndings have been pub-
lishedfscientists often have al-
ready shared the information
among themselves, he said; hard.
copy ‘articles primarily serve as

 

J

9   -Whatthef

archives. ,

The word “journal” may no
longer be appropriate for de-
scribing new electronic systems

of sharing scholarlyinformation,

Miller said. “The systems that

will disseminate research results, _ ‘

in many disciplines, will not look
like journals but will take advan-
tage of emerging technologies.”

Scholars could electronically

share raw data and multi—medi_a L

materials as well as research con-
clusions, he suggested.

“Maybe the concept of bring-
ing together eight or 10 articles

into one publication has outlived .
its usefulness,” Miller added."

(The ULS director said he’s less
inclined to agree with fellow li-
brarians who predict the demise
of book.-_-length scholarly mono-
graphs anytime soon.)

The transition to electronic-
only spread of research ﬁndings

, will occur only at theinsisitence

of the scholarly community, ac-
cording to Miller. Commercial
publishers, he said, are happy

with their current system of A"

charging inﬂated prices for elec-
tronic as well as printed versions
of journals.

Before universities, scholarly .
; societies, and faculty members

can agree to go with “e-journals”

t OCTOBER26, 2000

The AAU/ARL document, “Principles for Emerging

' Systems of Scholarly Publishing,” argues that increasing
volume and costs of scholarly publications — particularly in
science, technology and medicine — are making it impos-
sible for libraries to meet the research needs of faculty and

students.

Moreover, the ‘pressure on library budgets from high-

priced science, technology and medical publications has
made it difficult for academic publishers in the humanities
and social sciences to publish monographs or to afford _
moving to digital publishing systems, according to the

document. —

The text of “Principles for Emerging Systems of Schol-
arly Publishing” is available on-line at: http://vvww.arl.org/

One of the document’s recommendations was that uni-
versities hold forums for faculty to discuss the future of
scholarly publishing — hence, last week’s Senate plenary

Ensuring access to journal
archives is one such issue, Miller

said. “At Pitt, our policy is that ’

we won’t cancel a print journal
for an electronic—only version of
that same journal until there is a
sure way to have continued ac-
cess to back issues,” he noted.

And, should ULS cancel a .

subscription, the library system

wants perpetual access tojback _

issues that it already has pur-
chased,he said.

Currently, few publishers can,
or are willing, to provide the
kind of archival access that ULS
demands, said Miller. L

Provostjames  Maher said
electronic journals threaten the
scholarly societies that were

formed to promote communica— _

tion among researchers — and

which created the printed schol— .

arly journal to accomplish that
goal. he _ . .

Maher, a physicist, said he
read “with a heavy heart” an edi-
torial in a recent issue of Physics

Today, theimonthly journal of A

the American Physical Society.
_ In it, the society’s president wrote
that the organization stands
ready tp kill its printed journal in

Theprovost said escalating

age scientists to rely on yvhat he .

called “totally unregulated elec-
tronic communication mecha-
nisms, the most visible one be-
ing the Los Alamos Pre—Print
Collection,” available on the In-
ternet. " ’

“You can put any junk up.

there” .on the Los Alamos site,
Maher said. “It’s totally ‘let the
buyer beware’ when you look at
something on that. On the other
hand, no good paper that willbe
published in the next year in quite

a few ﬁelds of physics fails to be _

there [on the Los Alamos site]

first. So, very few people read-
the journals anymore. i _

“Electronic a publishing is
here,” Maher stated. “It’s having
an impact already. The scholarly
community has not really

thought through yet how to cope

‘with it and how to take_ advan-
tage of its good points and to
work around its obvious weak-
nesses. ,

“Some students are reading

, very li-ttle that isn’t on the Web,”

he continued, “and some of what
they’re readingis total nonsense.

Provostjames V. Maher said

the latest revision of U.S. copy- a '

right law, as originally drafted,
gave him nightmares of waking
up one morning to find that the
Disney Corp. had gained exclu-
sive rights to the dictionary.

Maher was exaggerating.
Slightly.

The original legislation,
which Congress rejected, threat-
ened to‘ give publishers control

—_ over university-produced re-

search to the point that profes-
sorsmight have faced problems
gaining access to their own pub-

, lished works, the provost said at

last week’s Senate meeting.
The amended legislation that

Congress approved in.fall 1998.

includes “fair use” provisions
defending academic interests, ac-
cording to Maher. ”

_- Lobbyists for the Association» '

of American Universities (AAU)
and the National Association of
State Universities and Land
Grant Colleges (NASULGC)
“had heavy input in approval of
those provisions of the law that

went in our favor,” Maher said.
“A N ASULGC lobbyist told

me that there is an incredible‘

fight to the death going on be-
tween the producers, transmit-
ters and users ofin,te’llectua'l
property. They’re all out for

involved party.” .
University ’ Library System

director Rush G. Miller said that

_ despite Congressional support,

“VVe’re in serious danger in this

And they don’t know how to
ﬁgure out” the difference.
Evelyn S. Rawski, University
Professor of history and a Uni-
versity Center forllnternational
Studies research professor, said
electronic publishing “permits

. me to dream of access [to schol-

arly research] that was com-
pletely impossible 20 years ago.”

But, she said, “It is time for
faculty to get down to very nitty—
gritty concerns about electronic
publishing.” Such as: How can
researchers be sure that their on-
line journal articles won’t be tam-
pered with? And, u_nder what
conditions should universities
consider electronic writings in
awarding tenure and promotion?

Currently, Rawski said: “At
least in the humanities and social
sciences, I am not aware of any

department that accepts elec—"

tronic publishing as a basis for
promotion and tenure. And the
reason has to‘ do with the peer
review aspect. That is to‘ say,
when a university press or other
reputable press has accepted a
book for publication, we know
that it has already gone through
a process of review. We trust the
label, so to speak. If we don’t
have that label, how are we do-
ing to perform this function, es-
pecially given the increasing spe-
cializationin each of our disci-

country of changing the nature
of copyright from promotion of

. Traditionally, he and Maher
said, faculty have transferred,
without direct compensation, all
copyrights to journal publishers
in return for wide distribution of
their work.‘But in some recent
cases, faculty "have been forced
to seek permission and pay a fee
to use their own work. -

Provost Maher said that, de-
spite popular notions to the con-
trary, Pitt doesn’t award tenure
and promotions based on the
number of books and journal
articles a faculty member has
published. “What we’re really
looking for are the referees’
evaluations of how good the
scholarship is,” he said. - »‘

Maher said he would be happy
to discuss changing Pitt’s tenure
and promotion system, which
relies heavily on scholarship pub-

' lished in printed books and jour-

nals. But Pitt’s system must con-

‘tinue to emphasize research that’

has been judged to be of high
quality by scholars worldwide —
and printed books and articles
published in refereed print jour-
nals remain the standard by
which scholars evaluate their
colleagues’ work. -

‘ Audience member Thomas
Metzger of the mathematics de-

' partment said,’ “We have to de-
cide whether e—journals are jour-.

nals or some specialty publish-
ing house.

“If you’re an assistant profes-
sor,” he continued, “you’re not
going to publish anything in an
electronic journal that’s not go-
ing to count” toward earning
tenure. “ ,

Metzger said he ‘knew of a

policies, the provost said.
Several years ago, h_e—recalled,
“Cal Tech encouraged its faculty
to refuse to sign blanket trans-
fer-of—copyright contracts". In-
stead,‘ faculty were to get pub-
lishers to agree to an alternative
contract, developed by Cal Tech
lawyers, which gave publishers

plenty of control over copyright‘

but protected access by faculty
to their own work.

Cal Tech faculty complained

that their school’s policy hurt ,

their chances of getting pub-
lished in leadingjournals, and

- the policy failed, Maher said.

tenured full professor who de— A

bated for a month before sub-

prof worried that publishing in"

an electronic journal didn’t count
for anything in his department’s
system for evaluating faculty per-
formance and might even lead to
a lower salary raise for him.

On the other hand, Metzger
said, the American Mathemati-
cal Society publishes a number

_ of electronic—only journals that

are respected among mathema-
ticians. Conferring respectabil-
ity on electronic—only journals
“can be done, but it’s got to be
done’ by the individual [schol-
arly] societies,” he argued.

ULS director Miller recalled
a failed, early—l99_0s effort by
the Ohio College and Libraries
Center to create a prototype e-
journal called Clinical Trials.
Hoping to encourage electronic
publication of reputable schol-
arship, the center spent more‘
than $2 million to develop the
new medical journal, even hir-
ing away the editor of a presti-
gious print journal.

tBut medical researchers‘

shunned the e—journal. “After
four or live years,” Miller said,

“they closed it without a single

submission.” ,

systems track within SIS’s gradu-
ate degree programs in telecom-
munications. The goal is to give
students a grasp of issues required
for design, deployment, manage-
ment and administration of fu-
ture wireless information sys-

tems. .The National Science ~

Foundation recently granted
$394,204 to the project, which
also has received grants from
Pennsylvania’s Link-to-Learn
program, Microsoft Corp. and
the AT&T Foundation-.
Krishnamurthy also is co-
leader of a project to create a
prototype wireless network

within SIS that will be connected .

to Pitt’s computer network. “The
wireless component is more or
less ready,” he says. “We’re just

‘waiting for the wired structure '

to be completed. As soon as that
is done, we’ll have wireless ac-
cess to the Pitt network through-
out our building.” Eventually,
students in SIS classrooms will
be able to access e—mail, text mes-

sages and the Web —— even lab

equipment and personal ﬁles and '

database collections —- all while
a‘ lecture, discussion or group
meeting is in progress.

Despite his own research and
teaching interests, Krishna-
murthy disagrees with those pro-
fessors who grumble that Pitt is

" wasting money and lagging be-

hind the times by continuing to
drill holes and rely on standard,
wire-and—wall-jack technology.

“Wireless is not going to re-

place wiring. It can only aug-

ment the services provided by
wiring,” he says. “VVhen people

talk aboutgiwiljeless technology,‘ _
they sometimes forget: that"..you..-_:‘

still need to connect to an access

point that is wired to your net-

work. , _
“Ten years ago, when wire-

less networks were ﬁrst being‘

proposed, everybody thought

they would replace wiring. You .

don’t have to lay cables, you'don’t

have to rip up old buildings. But
there have been huge advances
since then in wired communica-
tion, too. For example, the abil-
ity to send multi-megabit trans-
missions over regular phone
lines. ~ .
“Usually, what happens is that
wireless is always one step-"be-
hind wired communication.”

Thus, the Residential Net-
working‘ (ResNet) program to
equip Pitt undergraduate resi-
dence halls with Ethernetports
“was a good move, in my opin-
ion, ” says Krishnamurthy. _“Wir-
ing dormitories was a good idea
because everybody gets a lot of
bandwidth. With wireless,
there’s only so much bandwidth
available.” As more users con-
nect to ,a remote access point,
each person gets a smaller share
of bandwidth, which results in
slower network connections.

In general, wireless networks
are slower than wired ones.
VVhile today’s wireless networks
typically run at 11 megabits per
second, and the next generation
of wireless networks is expected
to run at up. to 54 megabits per
second, a desktop PC connected
to a current wired network can
operate at speeds of 150 mega-
bits per second or faster.

Security also remains a prob-
lem for wireless networks. A
network’s radio frequencies are
shared among users of that net-
work, so users can intercept one
another’s messages. “There has

~ been very little work done in this p

area so far,” says Krishnamurthy.
“It’s not difficult for a good
hacker to hack into’ most7wire-

#s1ess.=%t1e»tworks. He doesn’t have

to clip onto a wire somewhere,
he can just sit out on the lawn
and intercept signals.”

. ButKrishnamurthypredicted

PEOPLE OF TE TIIVIES

Robert B. Brandom, Dis-
tinguished Service Professor of
philosophy, has been elected to
membership in the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
He is among 1 5 4 fellows selected.-

Brandom was inducted as a
member of the Academy Oct. 14
in Cambridge, Mass.

A fellow in Pitt’s Center for .
' Philosophy of Science, Brandom

has served as chairperson of the
University’s philosophy depart-
ment; chair of the Facultyof Arts
and Sciences Humanities Coun-
cil; a member of the College of
Arts and’ Sciences curriculum
review committee/humanities;
and the Academic Integrity Re-
view Board.

He received his B.A. from
Yale and his Ph.D. in philosophy
from Princeton, where he was
both a Whiting and a Porter
Ogden Jacobus Fellow.

The Academy, founded in
1780 by John Adams and other
leaders of the young republic,
was created as a learned society
to “cultivate every art and sci-
ence which may tend to advance
the interest, honor, dignity, and
happiness of a free, independent
and virtuous people.” For more
than two centuries, the Academy
has brought together leading
U.S. figures from universities,
government, business and the
creative arts to exchange ideas
and promote knowledge in the

- . public interest.

This year’s inductees join a
distinguished membership of
approximately 4,000 fellows na-
tionwide, including 160 Nobel
laureates and 65 Pulitzer Prize
winners, who have been recog-
nized for their contributions to
sciences, scholarship, public af-
fairs and the arts.

Karl'_Kandler, assistant pro-
fessor of neurobiology at the

‘School of Medicine, was hon-
_ored at a White House ceremony
. this week as a recipient of the ,

highest award bestowed by the
UTS. government on outstand-
ing scientists and engineers be-
ginning their independent ca-
reers: '
Kandler will be one of several
recipients of the Presidential
Early Career Awards for Scien-

' tists and Engineers (PECASE).

He was recommended for the
award by the National Institutes
of Health for his work in fur-
thering the understanding of the
mechanisms by which neuronal
connections in the developing
brain become organized and spe-
cialized. Understanding the rules
by which neuronal networks
form is central to understanding
how the brain" works and _will
help researchers understand the
‘cause of mental disorders that
are rooted in development. Re-
sults of Kandler’s research may
reveal how neuronal activity is
transformed into the “wiring dia-
gram” of the brain.

The PECASE awards recog-
nize some of the country’s finest
scientists and engineers who,
while early in their research ca-
reers, show exceptional poten-
tial for leadership at the fron-
tiers of scientiﬁc knowledge.

Linda]. Marts, administra-
tor for undergraduate medical
education in the Department of
Medicine, received a special rec-

ognition award at the Clerkship
Directors of Internal Medicine
annual meeting Oct. 13.

Marts was recognized for her
contributionto the organization
in pioneering the development
of workshops for clerkship-ad-
ministrators from all medicine
departments in medical schools

' throughout the United States.

Gordon MacLeod, faculty
member in the Graduate School
of Public Health, has been named
vice president of the C. F.
Reynolds Medical History Soci-
ety for 2001-2003. He will as-
sume the presidency of the soci-
ety in 2003, serving in thatvca-
pacity until‘ 2005. -

MacLeod will be the ﬁrst per
son from GSPH to serve as presi-
dent of the society.

Anthony]. DeArdo, profes-
sor of materials science and en-
gineering, has been elected a fel-
low of ASM International, for-

merly the American Society of.

Metals. _

DeArdo was lauded‘ for his
outstanding contributions in the
area of microalloyed steels, in
particular relating to fundamen-
tal structure-property relation-
ships and thermomeachanical
processing.

DeArdo was one of the co-
inventors of “ green steel,” which

is replacing l.eaded steel in many

machine shops.

Dennis P. Curran, Bayer
Professor of Chemistry, has re-
ceived the Award of Excellence,
in Science from the Boston Col-
lege Alumni Association.

Curran, a 1975 graduate of
Boston College who is respon-
sible for some of the most pio-
neering research in chemistry,
especially the interface of radical
chemistry and organic synthesis,
was chosen for the award from
among 129,000 Boston College
alumni.

-Philip Watts, faculty mem-
ber in_ French and Italian lan-
guages and literatures, has won
this year’s Aldo and Jeanne
Scaglione Prize for French and
Francophone Studies for his “Al-
legories of the Purge: How Lit-
erature Responded to the Post-
war Trials of Writers and Intel-
lectuals in France.” V

The book was published last

year by Stanford University

Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic (WPIC) has opened a
new center that will enable sci-
entists to expand their study of a
number of severe mental ill-
nesses. .

By opening the Clinical Neu-
roscience Research Center
(CNRC), Pitt’-s Department of

Psychiatry becomes -the ﬁrst in .

the nation to develop" a special-
ized facility with the goal of revo-
lutionizing mental health re-
search and patient care.

“The CN RC provides pa-
tients with severe mental disor-
ders an environment that is safe
and appropriately staffed to meet
their needs,” said Arthur ‘S.

7 Levine, senior vice chancellor,

Schools of the Health Sciences,

I and medical school clean. “The
'_ University of Pittsburgh is truly

fortunate to have this opportu-
nity to lead the way‘ by being the
ﬁrst to open such a center.” The
new center is a satellite of the
UPMC’s General Clinical Re-
search Center (GCRC), one of

75 in the nation supported by J

the National Institutes of Health

7 to provide the infrastructure that

allows medical investigators to

conduct state-of—the—art patient- '

oriented research. .
The center will support stud-
ies that include patients with se-
vere mental. disorders, protocols
that require intensive monitor-
ing and supervision on an inpa-
tient basis and research‘ that in-
volves time isolation to study the
biological clock. _ _
Such studies are expected to
shed light on the effectiveness of
medications to ease the agitation

the post—dedication committee.

—-Michael Komichak, chair
of the Ukrainian Room commit-
tee, was vice chairman of the
Ukrainian Room committee at
its inception and participated in
all aspects of the room’s .creat—

ing. Aslhost of WPIT’s Ukrai-

nian Radio Hour, he rallied his
listeners to contribute a signiﬁ-
cant portion of the room’s build-

ing fund.

. Jessica Reynolds has been
promoted to assistant director of

. Admissions at Titusville. She had

been an admissions counselor at
the campus since 1998. r

The Pennsylvania Occupa-

tional Therapy Association has

given Terence W. Starz, clini-
cal professor of medicine, the
POTA Award of Appreciation
in recognition of his support-for
occupational therapy education
and research.

Margo B. Holm, professor

and director of post-professional
education, in occupational
therapy, was awarded the
Eleanor Clark Slagle Lecture-
ship in recognition of her exem-
plary contributions to occupa-
tional therapy research and edu-

Alzheimer’s disease; how the
drug olanzapine affects delta

sleep deﬁcits in patients with-

schizophrenia, and how the hu-
man body clock changes and af-
fects sleep as people age. 7‘

“We will be able to use the I

.CNRC’s resources to do impor-
tant research that may lead to
solutions for some of the most
vexing mental illnesses,” said
Daniel]. Buysse, associate pro-
fessor of psychiatry and program
director of the CNRC. “Studies
of many mental illnesses would
be difﬁcult, if not impossible,,to
complete without resources such
as the GCRC and CNRC.”
Currently, there are a dozen
research studies taking place at

' the CNRC that will account for

about 700 research days this year.
The number is expected to grow
to more than 1 ,5 00 research days
the following year.

The CNRC is located on the
13th floor of WPIC. It includes
ﬁve bedrooms, a nursing station,
treatment room, equipment con-
trol room and patient lounge.

There also are two time—isola- _.

tion units.

“VVPIC and the University _

of Pittsburgh’s Department of
Psychiatry lead the nation in re-
search funding from the National
Institutes of Health,” said David
J. Kupfer, Thomas Detre Pro-
fessor and chairperson of psy-
chiatry. “The addition of the
CN RC not only will keep us on
top,‘ but will serve as a resource

to attract both talent and addi— r

tional research dollars to the
University and to the city.” I

Department of Dermatology in
the School of Medicine.

I Falo, who for the past year
has served as the department’s
interim chairperson, is an asso-
ciate professor of dermatology.

From 1992 to 1993, Falo was
an instructor in both the Har-
vard Medical School department
of dermatology and-— the division I

UNIVERSPITYPTIIIVIES

Pitt will help to establish institute

monitoring public health threats .

Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University, with the support of
the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center, are establishing a Bio-
medical Security Institute
(BMSI) that will monitor public
health threats and alert emer-
gency management agencies na-
tionwide to attacks of
bioterrorism.

The Biomedical Security In-
stitute will provide a prepared-
ness, detection and response ca-
pability network that can be used
to respond rapidly and accurately
to acts of bioterrorism.

BMSI also will provide a
means to monitor naturally oc-
curring biological catastrophes,
such as outbreaks of West Nile
virus, as well as attacks with bio-
logical agents.

Speciﬁcally, the Biomedical
Security Institute will develop a
prototype computer—based sur-
veillance, analysis and commu-

The data will be evaluated to
alert agencies to various kinds of
threats to public health, whether
theyiare naturally occurring or
potential attacks.

BMSI has received funding
from the Centers for Disease

and the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ).

BMSI and the Centers for

Disease Control have entered .
into a long-term cooperative

agreement. to address bioter-
rorism issues, including devel-
oping a wide range of laboratory
and information technologies. A
grant of more than $900,000 to

draws upon the full resources of
the information technology,
medical, public health and policy
capabilities of two great univer-
sities. Their collaboration will
focus on an area key to our na-
tional well—being and security:
detecting attacks using biologi-
cal agents and weapons by using
computers and information tech-
nology,” Specter said.

Victor Weedn, head of Car- ,

negie Mellon’s Biotechnology
and Health Initiatives and an
internationally.known expert in
forensic DNA typing, and
Samuel J. Watson, director of
Pitt’s Public ‘Health and
Bioterrorism Response Program"
in the Graduate School of Public
Health, will co—direct the insti-
tute. ' A -
Biomedical Security Institute
experts will be the ﬁrst to as-
semble “end to end” capabilities
to respond to acts 1 of

bioterrorism. Watson and.

Weedn said the combination of
skills of the neighboring univer-
sities enabled the creation of
BMSI.

V “Pittsburgh is a new home to
national resources against
bioterrorism. This is another
exampleof the excellence and
scientiﬁc capability found here

and our emphasis in building

collaborative teams of research-
ers from both universities,”
Watson said.

- “We combine Carnegie
Mellon’sleadership in informa-

tion technology with Pitt’s ex— 3

cellence in medicine, medical
technology, bioinformatics and

public health research,” added‘

Weedn.

Initially, at Pitt’s Center for A

Biomedical Informatics, BMSI
will focus on the development of
a computer—based surveillance
system, which will use advances

in "information technology, es-

pecially data mining, artiﬁcial

intelligence and biomedical ’

informatics, as central features.
Eventually, through the Car-
negie Mellon Research Institute,

"BMSI will develop various new

on—line training technologies for
a preparedness training system
that will link federal, state ‘and
local agencies. I
