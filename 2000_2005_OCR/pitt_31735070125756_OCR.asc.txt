Fall Fest pits piesagainst Pitt pupils

COURTNEY LYNN
The Pitt News

With the arrival of fall this
weekend came Fall Fest, presented
by Pitt Program Council.

Pitt students filled Bigelow
Boulevard and the William Pitt

Union lawn Saturday to play games, .

listen to live bands and eat pie.

Sporting T-shirts that read,
“How much pie can you eat?” con-
testants took their places in front of
the, pies.

V Hoping to win the first place
prize of $100, 21 students participat-
ed in one of two contests.

_ Post-baccalaureate
Ramesh Reddy won the first pie-eat-
ing contest. After coming close to

winning last year, he decidedto give

it another try. .

, With pumpkin pie‘ covering this ’

shirt and a‘ smile across his face,
Reddy said the crowd really motivat-

led him. Reddy works at C-Side

Cafeteria swiping ID ‘cards and is a
familiar face to the students who eat
there. Many cheered him on by
chanting, “Swiper, swiper.”

Senior Jessy Pierce ‘won the sec-
ond contest. As she scarfed down the

and watched in amazement. Her
advice for next year’s contestants:
“You can’t chew the crust. Drink it
down with water.”

Later in the day when the pie-
eating contests were finished and the
inﬂatable games were deﬂated, local
cover band Sideview took the stage
as the first of three bands and enter-
tained an enthusiastic audience. .

Following Sideview came Mind
Boxing Alliance. They presented a
hip-hop showcase featuring Ray,
Glowinthedark, Victor, Dan Dabber,

,B-bonics, V J-Flint, Bravo, Sahr

Dummy and Y/amez.

Headlining act SR-71, a national
recording artist, proved a huge hit.
They took the stage around 6:30
p.m. and performed for an hour.
When the band played its hit single

'- “Right Now,” the audience enthusi-

asm was palpable. After the perfor-
mance, the band announced that they
had to leave the city in an hour but
would stay until then and sign auto-
graphs.

Fall Fest is one of Pitt Program
Council’s biggest projects. -It is
essentially a three—day ' event.

Bigelow Boulevard closed Friday to
begin the long preparation for
Saturday and reopened Sunday after
cleanup. Planning for the event

_started this summer, and although i

this is a project for the special events
committee, every committee helped
with the effort.

The bands required the most
planning and most of the budget.
Special Events Director Jocelyn

to $30,000 was spent on the entire
event, and about 75 percent of that

.~ THE PITT NEWS ‘ ‘ I 5

Authorities around the
world arrest suspects

Arrests, page 1

U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to
collect information from the Middle East
through electronic and other high-tech
means. On the day of the New York and
Virginia attacks, electronic intercepts
also showed bin Laden associates report-
ing over airwaves that they had hit two
targets. '
The meaning of the conversation
regarding the supposed Boston plot
“wasn’t totally clear. It was innuendo,”
the law enforcement source cautioned.
But the communication, coupled
with other evidence that possible associ-
ates of the hijackers had booked travel for

-Saturday, exacerbated concerns about a

possible attack on that date. And Justice
Department officials say they want to err
on the side of caution in putting out word
on ‘all possible threats, even if they are
uncorroborated. Ashcroft also put out
warning calls to unidentiﬁed states other
than Massachusetts, a Justice Department
official said.

With rumor sometimes turning to
near hysteria over the threat of another
attack, the day was met with both deﬁ-
ance and trepidation in hot spots on the
East Coast.

In Boston, some 20,000, people
showed up for a religious revival in front

  of City Hall.  

“Twenty thousand people turning out

I on this day —- that’s pretty good evidence

that people are getting back to their

lives,” said Boston Police Department’

spokesman Cliff Connolly.

But in New. York City, Isma Poulos, A

32, said she took the bus into Manhattan
Saturday morning because of rumorsof
another attack on Saturday. She wanted
to avoid the train because it went into
Grand Central Station, site of bomb

; threats since the Sept. 11 attacks.
, Oﬁicials said Saturday that they have '
gathered stronger evidence that addition-

al hijackings might have been plarmed
for Sept. 11 because investigators found
box-cutter knives in two other planes ﬂy-
ing out that day. Two knives were found
in seat cushions on a plane out of Boston
and another was found in the trash bin of
an Atlanta plane, a Justice Department
official said in confirming a report in
Saturday’s Washington Post.
“ Authorities are pursuing a range of
possible connections between the hijack-
ers and a network of European terrorist
that came under investigation even
before the Sept. 11 attacks in the United
States.

" Investigators in Europe say the net-
work has ties to bin Laden and, according
to reports Saturday, there could also be

ties to an imprisoned French-Moroccan

suspect in the United States who is sus-
pected of plotting to take part in the U.S.
hijackings. ‘

In the suspected plot to bomb the
U.S. embassy in Paris, Belgian police

‘said they discovered 220 pounds of sulfur

and 13 gallons of acetone during a raid
late Thursday that netted the arrests of
two men who were charged with criminal
conspiracy.

The chemicals are linked to Islamic
militants, one a former Tunisian soccer
player named Nizar Trabalsi, who were
arrested days after the U.S. hijackjngs in
the Netherlands and Belgium in the
alleged plot against the embassy in Paris.
Those men are charged with intent to use
explosive materials, criminal conspiracy
and other crimes and reportedly had sus-

~ picious maps and documents related to

the chemicals in their possession. .
In addition, police in Paris on Friday
rounded up another seven suspects dur-
ing predawn raids in working-class sub-
urbs. The judge who ordered those raids,
a veteran anti-terrorism specialist named
J ean. Louis Brugiere, ﬂew. to Dubai
Friday to question an alleged bin Laden
associate considered the key ﬁgure in the
European network. The suspect, Jamal
Beghal, was arrested in July and is said to
have trained at bin Laden terrorist camps
in Afghanistan. His arrest led French
police to the other suspects, -whom
French intelligence agents have shad-
owed for weeks as they allegedly con-

.- ducted reconnaissance on the embassy,

according to authorities.

In another development Saturday, a
British newspaper reported that two of
the men arrested in Friday’s raids in Paris

_ had contact with Zacarias Moussaoui, the

French-Moroccan arrested in Minnesota
in August while studying at a ﬂight
school. Subsequent investigation has led
U.S. and French investigators to suspect
that Moussaoui might have been the 20th
hijacker to carry out the Sept. 11th sui-

cide mission if he had not been arrested. ,

French intelligence agents placed
Moussaoui under scrutiny years ago as a
suspected Islamic extremist. French
authorities say he spent at least three or
four years in London, where he might
have crossed paths with two French sus-
pects arrested in the embassy plot Friday.
The Times of London reported Saturday
that Moussaoui is believedto have shared
an apartment with Jerome and David
Courtellier, two French converts to Islam.

The widening investigation marks
what Washington, D.C., security expert
John L. Martin, _a former Justice
Department official, predicted will be a
new age of coordination and intelligence-
sharing between Europe and the United
States in tracking down terrorists. '

PERSPECTIVES

EDITORIAL

Media shouldn’t dictate thought

What we will perhaps remember as the

deﬁning event of our generation occurred‘

Sept. 11, when three planes crashed into the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

But unless you’ve been in your own
world, isolated ﬁom everyone else the last
13 days, you didn’t need us to tell you that.
Likely, you’ve been glued to the television
since then, receiving infonnation on new
developments minutes after they happen.

You’ve now probably seen United
Airlines ﬂight 175 crashing into the World
Trade Center’s south tower hundreds of
times. You’ ve probably seen footage of peo-
ple jumping to their deaths. You’ve proba-
bly heard phrases such as “the events of
Sept. 11,” “America’s new war” and
“America unites” all too frequently.

But how well do you truly grasp the
gravity of what happened? Does it seem like
an action movie?

If you answered yes to the second ques-
tion, you’re not alone. Too often the media
— especially the broadcast media — fail to
maintain an adequate balance between con-
veying the gravity of an event and sensa-
tionalizing it to the point where people
become desensitized. _

The ﬁrst few days after the attacks,
many television networks seemed to loop
the video of ﬂight 175 whenever they could.

Thankfully, most networks have now
decided only to run the video when it per-
tains to a speciﬁc story. That doesn’t undo

the damage of rtmning it repeatedly the ﬁrst
few days. To many, it now seems like a

' scene from an unreal action ﬁlm more than V

a real action that caused the deaths of thou-
sands.

While it is important to see such
footage, networks should present it in such
a way that makes people think about what
happened That applies to all coverage of
major events.

Ultimately, we must look to multiple
sources of news to get the whole story.
Everyone has his or her own biases and ﬁl-
ters of information.

Do not take what the media tells you as
gospel. Look to multiple sources of infor-
mation. While the broadcast media have the
most up-to-date information, the print
media have the most in-depth. The Internet
is an ideal place to seek information as long
as you check the credibility of your sources.
Seeing what other television and radio sta-
tions have to say can also be valuable.

It is the media’s responsibility to pro- ,
vide information, but staying informed is
your responsibility. No one source can give
you the whole story or the absolute truth.

Take into consideration what the media
have to say, but make your own informed
judgment ,

It is our hope that, by considering infor-
mation from multiple sources, each person
willmake sense ofthe last 13 days inhis or
her own way. ‘

War is just guts, not glory

I’m going to let everyone in on a little
secret. There’s a reason that the CIA code word
for Afghanistan isn’t “Happy Fun Place.” The
CIA World Fact Book uses the phrases “mostly
rugged mountains” to describe its geography
and cites, “earthquakes in the Hindu Kush
Mountains; flooding; [and] droughts” as its
environmental hazards.

All these factors don’t make Afghanistan a
Middle Eastern Club Med. But, hey, whols
talking about fun in the sun when there’s
invading to do?

I’m not saying that the United

war is, does and costs. The revolutions (and
uprisings and confrontations) have been tele-
vised for so long that we grew numb to the ter-
ror, panic and devastation they wreak.

“War is hell” is perhaps one of the most
famous quotes concerning the military arts.
Uttered by Civil War Gen. William T , Sherman
during his march through Georgia, he said this
as _he gained ground, enlarged his army_ and
destroyed the economic backbone of the
American South, which would not recover for
100 years. I
V And this is the winner’s opin-

States will start a land war in Asia.
In fact, I’m willing to lay down
money saying that President Bush
will probably lob missiles worth
more than the GNP of Upper Volta
at Afghanistan, thus slapping a high-
ly explosive Band—Aid on a bruised,
battered and broken leg.

Still, on the off chance that
we’re actually going to use any of
those 15,000 soldiers, sailors and

‘ion. The United States never lost a
declared war. Both Vietnam and
Korea never gained Congressional
approval, thus making them mili-
tary actions guided by the execu-
tive branch and not war. .

But in each war, we sacrificed a
generation of 17- to 26-year-olds. It
won’t be our parents or grandpar-
ents fighting. It will be us, if the
draft goes into effect. P

servicemen (yes, and service-
women) we sent to the Middle East, we should
remember what war is actually like.

War is messy, dirty, bloody and, most of
all, costly. War not only taxes the nation’s
financial and material resources but also its
human ones. During war, more die of disease
and privation than on the battlefield.

In Europe, most refer to World War-II as
simply “The War.” A mere ‘60 years cannot
erase the ravage of trenches, bombs and battles
that both the Axis and the Allied Powers left in
their wake.

We haven’t fought a war on U.S. soil since
the Civil War. It has been 140 years since our
nation’s divided house fell and took most of a
generation with it. There has been ample time
to forget what cannon blasts sound like, what
rivers red with blood look like, what breaking
a nation socially, politically and economically,
as well as militarily, actually means. I .

Because Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11
attacks are the exception, rather than the rule,
we know little of domestic warfare. The United
States’ battlefields know only tourists and re-
enactors.

When removed from the nation’s back-
yards and simply transmitted through media
broadcasts, people find it easy to forget what

_ Our generation doesn’t know
what it’s like to crouch under desks as air raid
sirens wail or get hosed by cops in riot gear.
We associate the ‘40s with America’s glory
days, see the ‘50s as a large-scale version of
“Leave It to Beaver,” and connect the ‘60s with
images of free love under clouds of hash
smoke.

We have never tasted defeat. It is as foreign
to us as the mountains of Afghanistan. In an era
of “Star Wars,” missile defense shields and
nuclear weaponry, the stakes skyrocket beyond
simple issues of national security. Afghanistan
could make Vietnam look like an afternoon at a

McDonald’s playground. How many villages.

do we need to burn, bomb and pulverize before
we declare the nation saved?

My hesitation at" jumping the gun and
invading comes partly from the selfish fear of
losing friends and relatives. But my more
immediate fear is that we allow ourselves to
forget history and latch onto the notion that
war brings honor and glory.

Sydney Bergman reminds people that war is
unhealthy for children and other things, like

- ﬂuﬂy kittens, fuzzy little puppies and those on

the receiving end of bullets/bombs. She can be

food. I had one guy tell me ﬂat out that he wanted
money to get drunk. Then I ran into some guys on
Forbes Avenue who were wearing signs that read
“Thirsty: Need Money for Beer.” My first reac-
tion: “Aw, shucks, fellas. How can I say no to an
honest plea?” But then I remembered that they
were going to blow my money on beer and I need-
ed it to pay my outrageous cable bill — if the ﬂier
said $13, why am I paying $30?

Can Pitt students solve the problem of home-

lessness?

Probably. We can help our unfortunate broth-
ers as long as we are willing to pitch in and
encourage them. '

Here’s to success.

Pride does not cheapen deeds’

I would like to comment on Heather Bowlan’s
article in Friday’s Pitt News titled, “Self-absorbed
volunteerism cheapens deeds.” Acting‘ overly
proud about having given blood, attending a vigil
or painting a mural -does nothing to cheapen these
honorable deeds. One could argue it cheapens a
person’s character or their motives for action. But
while our country is in a state of mourning and

 stress over the efforts to heal all those injured,

both physically and emotionally, I wish a colum-
nist would choose not to be critical of the people
who are contributing their time, energy and blood.

As the article stated, “We just have to deal
with what’s happened any way we can and try to
heal.” This includes the self—absorbed in a world in
which there are very few true altruists. For those
who are hungry, hurt or missing, the motives of the
rescuers are unimportant. To those who say, as the
article put it, “I can’t talk long..I have to go paint
a commemorative mural before I donate blood
again,” please continue to hold your heads up high
for your praiseworthy efforts.

Aaron Juda
Junior, CBA

Proud to be an American

David Chung’s editorial (“Americans fail to

comprehend motives behind attacks,” Sept. 21) is.

upsetting. He expresses his shock at why America
does not understand Afghanistan’s hatred toward
us. Considering that the United States is
Afghanis’tan’s primary source of relief aid, 1 still
don’t understand why they burn our flag.

Chung says he sees the statement “I’m proud
to be an American, where at least I know I’m free”
as a way of sticking one’s tongue out at non-
Americans. I have Italian and Irish blood, and I am

_ proud of that, just as I am proud to be have been

born in the United States. How that is sticking my
tongue out at other cultures and nations, I will
never know.

The following line i-n the song goes, “And I
. won’t forget the men who died who gave that right

to me.” That’s thanking the Union soldiers who

‘freed slaves, the American veterans who saved

Europe in both World Wars and the farmers who
grabbed their riﬂes to fight the British'—A-earning
our independence.

The lyric also thanks. my very own Papap
O’Hara who during WWII gave up his basketball
scholarship‘ to run a one-man artillery boat back
and forth to Panama as torpedoes missed him by

inches because his boat was too small. He was '

“proud to be an American.”

Mr. Chung, “I’m proud to be an American” in
no way encourages the ethnocentrism that you
claim it does.

Sporting a new exhibitio

Largest exhibition of
science and sports in the  
world shares North Shore
with Pirates and Steelers 

EVAN CASE
The Pitt News

For rabid football fans making the near-week-
ly pilgrimage to Pittsburgh’s newest gridiron
cathedral, the UPMC SportsWorks building proba-
bly looks like a gigantic metal warehouse. Located
just across the street from Heinz Field,
SportsWorks is the largest exhibition center of sci-
ence and sports in the entire world.

My cousin Josh and I decided to spend the
afternoon before a Friday Pirates game exploring
the Carnegie Science Center. For a few hours we
meandered, inspecting the familiar attractions and
thinking that the $14-per-ticket price was a little
too steep. That’s when we decided to cross the
street and check out the Science Center’s month-
old SportsWorks exhibit.

Upon entry we knew that our money had been
well spent. Morethan 70 sports-themed attractions
were spread out across the 36,000 square feet
before us. The roof rested high above our
awestruck gazes. I heard myself unconsciously
mutter “Coooo1 ...” as if I were Bart Simpson and
had just gotten my hands on a bag of cherry
bombs. I could tell that Josh shared my senti-
ments. ‘

It was as much a playground for adults as for
kids. Best of all, on this particular afternoon the
building was almost devoid of patrons, meaning
that we could experience the best exhibits multiple

’ times without waiting.

While there are several
amazing “Hey, I saw that on
‘The Learning Channel”’-type
virtual reality simulators at
SportsWorks, the Orbitron
first caught my eye. It’s a cir-
cular metal monstrosity that
spins riders in three directions
at once — I have wanted to 
this attraction for nearly a
decade.

Initially thinking that the
ride spun on its own, I was
surprised to discover that, like
the Tilt-A-Whirl at a carnival,
shifting your body weight gen-
erates a majority of the move-
ment. After two minutes I had
broken a healthy sweat.

While Josh took his turn on the Orbitron, I

the exhibits had these educa-

a habit of reading. The attrac-
tions themselves provided
ample sugar to help the medi-
cine of extra-curricular learn-
ing go down.

Alas, not every exhibit was
as simple as the
Orbitron. In par-
ticular, the pitch-
ing area present-
ed a serious haz-
ard to my personal dignity. I
never realized how far 60 feet

found myself on the mound

I failed. I

My most accurate attempt hit the painted
decoy batter in the ‘ throat. It was ugly, but I
received some solace from the fact that none of
those other would-be Randy Johnsons could hit
the strike zone either. .

Despite spending two hours in the
largely empty building, we couldn’t
experience all that SportsWorks had to
offer before reluctantly leaving.
Personally, I’d love to design and ride one more
roller coaster in the 360-degree rotating virtual
reality simulator exhibit. I

Still, I’m sure that I’ll be back later this year,
scoring virtual goals, spiking virtual volleyballs,
driving virtual monster trucks and beaning virtual
batters. -

Volleyball sweeps
for second time

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor
V The Pitt volleyball team struggled
early on this season, but those woes
now appear to be a thing of the past.
The team continued its winning ways
this weekend when it won its second
game in a row. The Panthers swept
Providence 3-0 before a crowd of 210.

The win comes just‘ four days after
Pitt swept Robert Morris, the team’s
only two sweeps so far this season.

The game at Peterson Recreation
Center in Providence, R.I., was the Big
East opener for both teams. With the
win, Pitt improves to 4-5 overall and
1-0 in the Big East while the Friars fall
to 1-8 overall and 0-1 in conference
play.

Pitt was solid from the start, taking
the first match 30-15. Providence
made a comeback in the second match,
staying close to the Panthers but ulti-
mately ‘falling 30-26. Pitt took the
third match 30-20 to seal the victory.

Sophomore outside hitter Wendy
Hatlestad, who recorded a match-high
14 kills, led the Panthers. Fresliman

‘Gini Ullery added 10 kills and seven

digs ‘while junior setter Carrie Norris
contributed 35 assists and seven digs.

.As a team, Pitt picked up a total of
10 blocks and 11 aces.

Senior Sarah Katinger and fresh-
man Ayana Cadres, who each chipped
in with 10 kills, led Providence. Annie
Cella also added nine kills while Susan
Fanning picked up 26 assists.

The Friars managed just four team
blocks and four aces, and no player
picked up ' more than four digs for
Providence. ' .

The Panthers are moving closer to
resembling last year’s team that im-
ished 22-10 and 8-4 in the Big East.

The team played a total of .36
matches so far, and Hatlestad leads the
team overall with 4.75 kills per match
and a total of 171 for the year. Norris
is the team’s leader in assists, averag-
ing 11* per match and recording 407 so
far this season.

with 2.22 digs per match, and Ullery

The return of the sports fan

As a member of the sports media I have noticed
that sports lost a bit of the power and appeal it once
had on me when I was just a super fan. When you
“work” sports, you start to lose some of the zeal you
once had for it. Sometimes I really start

find the escape I was in search of. Ironically, it was
the team that has given me 10 years of pain and suf-
fering that helped ease my troubled spirit;

The Cincinnati Bengals and all their ineptitude
managed to beat the defending Super Bowl

playing holidays, to sport wouldbe as
tedious as to work.”
This weekend, a part of me that

palate of sports would help ease my
mind from the country’s recent
tragedies. Even as I saw beautiful and
touching displays of patriotism at base-
ball and college football games during
the week, all they seemed to do is just
remind me even more of the devasta-

Ravens turned the ball over six times and
their offense moved with about as much
grace as a 600-pound ballerina, but the
Bengals still won.

That’s something I haven’t been able

actually excited about a Mike Brown-
owned Bengals team, something I thought
I would never say.

I don’t expect to see the Bengals in
the Super Bowl, or even in the playoffs this
year or the next, but for a few hours yes-

tion that had happened.

When I turned on the television Sunday mom-
ing, I didn’t fully believe I could escape for a few
hours, but I figured I at least had to keep up with
what happened for my job’s sake.

The start of NASCAR’s MBNA Cal Ripken Jr.
400 race in Dover, Del., tugged at every American
fiber in my body. Lee Greenwood’s singing of
“Proud to Be an American” before the start of the
race as 140,000 fans in Dover waved ﬂags and
chanted “U-S-A” had me on my feet.

You would think I felt proud to be an American
after seeing that,‘ and believe me I was and am. ‘But
all I could keep thinking about was just the pure
viciousness of the attack launched against my great
homeland.

Even watching the race fueled my feelings of
anger and pride as many of the multimillion-dollar
sponsors of the cars gave up some, if not all, their
advertising space for American ﬂags or “God Bless
America” decals. M&M’s Candy gave up all their
space on Ken Schrader’s Pontiac so his crew could
paint the car like an American flag.

I enjoyed watching Dale Eamhardtr Jr. battle
with other drivers for the win, but I still couldn’t

terday they gave this American some real
relief from the recent troubles.

When Takeo Spikes intercepted an Elvis Grbac
pass and returned ‘it for a touchdown to put the
Bengals up by 11 points in the fourth quarter, you
had to scrape me off my 10-foot-high ceilings
because I was so excited. I completely lost myself in
a sporting event, another thing that hasn’t happened
in a while. _

I cheered, yelled and cursed. I ordered pizza and
drank beer. I was a regular sports fan again.
Shakespeare may be one of the greatest writers of
the English language and his work may have a lot of
prevalence more than 400 years later, but sometimes

know when to come home.

The game between Bowling Green (3-0) and
Temple (1-2, 0-0) was a matter of who made the big-

than 28 yards, but Bowling Green ultimately won
the battle, beating Temple 42-23. ,

Temple out-gained Bowling Green 356 to 248
yards and also had the ball 11 more minutes than
Bowling Green.

Bowling Green’s Chad Long had a 30-yard

Shockey rises from obscurity to lead Hurricanes

COLLEEN ADKINS
The Miami Hurricane

Jeremy who?

That’s what almost any Hurricane
fan would be uttering before Jeremy
Shockey became a Miami legend-in
last season’s monumental win over
Florida State.

By catching a 13-yard touchdown
pass from then sophomore quarter-
back Ken Dorsey in the final minute,
Shockey finalized an upset to give
Miami a 27-24 victory over top-
ranked Florida State. Not only was the
winning grab against FSU a godsend,
but it was Shockey’s first touchdown
catch as a Hurricane.

’ The 6—foot-6, 236-pound junior
tight end transferred to Miami after a
short stint in the Oklahoma ‘ junior col-
lege ranks. Shockey’s relocation to
Miami can be considered his first

legitimate excursion out of the state of T

Oklahoma.
He was born and raised in Ada,

. and graduated by the high school of
the same name. If it weren’t for _a fate-

ful turn of events, Shockey would still

be playing in Oklahoma’s collegiate
system.

“In high school, I was committed
to go to Oklahoma University, but the
coaching staff was fired and I was

erased off the recruiting board, and I

didn’t want to go to a smaller school
like Oklahoma‘ State,” Shockey said.
“I decided to go to community college
and after that I had a spring game
there. Coach [Larry] Coker is from
Oklahoma and he came and thought I
could play at the next level and
offered me a scholarship.”

Though Shockey’s collegiate
episode in Oklahoma was a short one,
he gained a valuable understanding of
the academic and football lifestyle.

“Community college helped me
out a lot. It showed me how to be
independent, even though it was only
three hours from my house,” Shockey
said. “But as for football, it was
always a struggle on the team to keep.
your position and we had_real tough
opponents. We played the Texas
League, and it was pretty competi-
tive.”

Well, Miami is definitely not

Oklahoma, and Shockey’s expecta-
tions have most certainly multiplied
since his arrival at Miami. The junior,
however, has definitely not had a
change in his competitive nature.

“I’m real competitive at whatever
I do, whether it be with video games,
computer games, whatever,” Shockey
said. “But whatever it is, I get mad
when I lose.”

Competition aside, Shockey just
likes showing the opponent who’s in
charge, and most of the time, he will
prevail. Because of this dominant
mentality on the field, he’s been
labeled as an angry aggressor.

Despite this violent urge to ﬂatten
his opponent, Shockey considers him-
self to be a sociable and chatty person.

“The best part about the game is
that you can take your anger out on
anybody,” Shockey said. “I like lining
up knowing that the guy is trying to
hurt me and I’m trying to hurt him,
and may the best man win. It’s just a
ﬁght at every play.

“It’s really fun going against some-
body, dominating them. You know
they’ve been working hard to get to

the point where they’re at and you just
try to take it away from them. Bryant
McKinnie called me mean and angry.
But I’m not angry. I’m outgoing and
real talkative. It doesn’t matter who
you are, I’ll talk to you.”

In the wake of the tragic terrorist
attacks that unfolded Sept. 11, the

‘ people of America obtained a greater

sense of how valuable life is and how
quickly it can be taken away.

Even before the catastrophic day,
Shockey owned this great appreciation
for his existence. ’

“I just take my life one day at a
time, and treat every day like it’s my
last,” he said. “You never know what’s
going to happen, like what happened
(with the terrorist attacks). So I treat
everyday like it’s precious, take every-
thing that I get and be grateful for it.

“Even before the attacks, I told
people at my community college that
we have to win [the Washington
game]. It might be our last one. I’m
sure they knew it wouldn’t be, but
that’s what I mean. You’ve got to
come into life knowing there might
not be another day.”

A Lecture & Learning
Series on Journalism

Tired of just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance

to make news. ’

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do
journalism. Come learn about how it’s done, and then consider _
actually making history by doing it for the University’s only‘

independent daily newspaper.

Applications will be available at each talk in case you like
what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just '
stop by, learn a little, and talk with the people who already
edit and write the newspaper.

“An Eye for the Action: Sports Reporting.”

1 Presented by Ed Bouchette, sports writer, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

“More Than Just Two Cents’ Worth: Effective Column Writing.”

“It’s Always About People: Writing Better Features and Profiles.”
