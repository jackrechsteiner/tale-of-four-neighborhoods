Banned books celebrated at reading

DAVID’ TKACIK
Staff Writer

Adistinguished guest panel of
11 local artists and public figures
read excerpts from their favorite
banned or controversial books,
drawing both periods of thoughtful
silence and chuckles from the
crowd of more than 200 ‘Wednesday
night at the Carnegie Library
Lecture Hall.

Before the reading began, the
young mingled with the old in an
unusual display of how the age gap
can be bridged with a common
interest — reading and celebrating
great books that were once banned.

When the event’s host, Phat
Man Dee, took the stage with her a
sparkling gown, pearl necklace, and
bald head — save for two out-
landish pigtails — the crowd quick-
ly quieted and prepared for the
American Civil Liberties Union-

sponsored event to begin.
Two of the guests onthe event’s

' bill were not present at the event.

Fred Honsberger, a cable-news
-and radio-show host who is also
known affectionately as “the
Honzman.” . '

Speaking on his behalf was City
Controller Tom Flaherty, who read
from ‘—‘A Coney Island of the Mind,”
by Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

Also absent from the bill was
Pitt Professor emeritus and South
African activist Dennis Brutus.

Minette Seate, an Emmy Award-
winning producer, read a novel dear
to many young women: “Are You
There God? It’s Me, Margaret,”. by
Judy Blume.

junior Emily Stoddart, said most

works full time, Pritchard still man-
ages to find room for a tanning bed
session three times a week. While
she hasn’t experienced any serious
health repercussions yet, one group
of researchers claims that teen-age
tanning habits like hers are evi-
dence that a large number of young
women are gambling with the long-
term health of their skin.

An estimated 36.8 percent of

white, teen-age girls in the United

States use tanning beds, lamps or
other commercial tanning processes

. that utilize ultraviolet, or UV, light,

according to a study by researchers
at Case Western Reserve University.
This suggests that many teens are,
knowingly or not, risking skin can-
cer for the sake of sporting a good
tan.

The study, which appeared in
the September issue of Archives of
Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine,
estimated that 47 percent of col-
lege-aged, white, teen-age girls, and
28 percent of all white, teen-age
girls, have been UV tanning three or
more times. i

The study found

that the

American Midwest, the area of the

country with the fewest beaches,
and the American South, the area
with the most, are the most popular
regions for UV tanning among
teens.

At least 38 tanning salons — or
hair and nail salons that also offer
tanning — advertise within city
limits, according to the Pittsburgh

_ Yellow Pages.

“There’s no medically healthy
benefit to using UV tanning beds,”
said Dr. Douglas Kress, an associate
professor and director of Clinical
Dermatology Studies at Pitt. “By

tanning, teens should know that you
only increase your chances of con-
tracting skin cancer and premature-
ly aging your skin.” ' P c,
There are three types of skin-
damaging solar light spectrurris:
UVA, UVB, and UVC. The earth’s
atmosphere blocks out UVC rays.
UVB rays are responsible forsun-
burns —-— a natural warning alarm of
too much sun — while UVA rays
cause tanning —-— the pigmentation
of skin without visible burning.
Tanning beds, which first gained
popularity in the 1970s, reduce
UVB levels and rely on UVA to
achieve results. While the process
helps to give a tan without the burn,

' according to Dr. Kress, it concen-

tratesicancer-causing radiation on
the skin, also causing itto age pre-
maturely and show pronounced
wrinkles and freckling,earlier<.'

“I deal with plenty of college-
aged people —— 20, 21 years old —
who have already developed various
skin cancers through [UV] over-
exposure,”.Kress said. _

According to the American
Academy of Dermatology, teens
receive around 80 percent of their
healthy lifetime sun exposure by the
time they turn 18.

‘‘I’m not sure why we feel the
need to tan,” Pritchard said. “I
guess we think we look better being

t _tan.ttIttt”(s¥_like,_ once you get one tat-
I too, you want a lot more.”

Although teens in the Case

~ v;;,,,.Western§ s.t._i1._¢;ly. .tanr;ed predominant-

ly for ‘beauty reasons, [the study
found that continued tanning., both
indoor and outdoor, --resulted in
damaged, skin by or before the time
tanners reached middle age.

' Many teens in the study also
said t’anniI1’g booths attractedlthem
because the salons promoted the

_boo,th,,S, as being safer for skin than

natural sunlight.

“Every time we’d go there,
they’d_ say, ‘Oh, it’s a lot safer than
the sun,”’ Pritchard said. “I don’t
know if it’s true, but I still went.”

“I .couldn’t drive yet — I was
15,” she added. ,

Texas and Tennessee recently
passed laws to inform teens of tan-
ning bed risks and to require apar-

. ent’s consent before they can use
- the beds. ‘

The Indoor Tanning
Association, which represents com-
mercial tann.ing bed operators
around the country, has criticized
the study’s findings, particularly the
suggested connection between tan-
ning bedsand cancer.

lishing such a study will create only,

the unhealthy result of soaring peo-
ple out of getting any UV light at
all, either inside and outdoors.

A recent press release written
on behalf of Wolff System
Technology, a major manufacturer
of indoor tanning equipment,
asserted that there are medical
experts who believe such rays are
helpful, in conservative doses, in
fighting colon, prostate, breast and
other cancers, as well as maladies
like diabetes, hypertension, and
osteoporosis.

Teens may be at particular risk
for developing skin c.ancer from UV
overexposure, because the disease
is thought to flourish in rapidly
replicating cells, like those of peo-
ple who are still growing.

Lifetime Television’s Website
recently ran study results aimed at
informing women about the health

dangers of too much UV exposure.

The site recommended sunblock of
strength SPF 30 or higher as the
safe minimum for temporary pro-
tection outdoors. The study found,

however, that heavy sunblock cov-.

erage alone does not eliminate the
chance of negative health effects.
The study discouraged tanning
oils as a sunblock substitute, since
most oils have an SPF of 2 or less,
and they are meant to attract rays
for quicker tanning, instead of pro-
tecting skin from damage.
Sunless.com, a Web site. with
information on all forms, of lightless
tanning, recommended relying on
skin bronzing creams in varying
layers, as well as exfoliates and
moisturizers, to achieve a healthy
tan. The cost of regularly using

such products, however, is usually’

higher than the cost of using UV
tanning, techniques. ' V ,
In recent years, “Mystic Tan”
technology has gained popularity as
an alternative to tanning beds. The

process, developed by a Texas doc-
tor in the late 1990’s, takes about a
minute. , .

The customer steps into a show-
er—like booth, usually with a shower
cap, and closes his or her eyes. The
person is then coated with a fine
mist of a water—soluble solution
containing bronzing lotion, aloe
Vera, and dihydroxyacetone, or
DHA. .

DHA is a protein reactant that
creates the appearanceof an even
tan in the skin’s topmost layers. In
order to keep this tan from washing
or rubbing off, however, reapplica—
tion is necessary every 4 to 5 days,
which makes the process cheaper
than creams, but still more expen-
sive than using tanning beds.

Most Mystic—style tanning oper-
ators charge at least $10 a session,
not including local sales, according
to Sun1ess.com. Somebody trying to
keep an even tan for a month would
have to shell out at least $80 dol-
lars.

Pritchard says that price defi-
nitely played a part in her UV tan-
ning regimen.

“Where I went, it was a month
unlimited for $30,” she said. “And
that’s pretty much why I went every
day —— so I could get my money’s
worth in high school.’’

Lightless 1 tanning proprietors
have also profited from the previ-
ously untapped market of people
with pronounced photosensitivity,
like Vitiligo, a common skin dis-

ease in which patches of skin lose

their color. This segment of the tan-

ning population previously had to

rely on hand-applied creams and
other non—light—related measures.
Sun exposure is also important
as a source of Vitamin D, which is
produced" when UV rays interact
with chemicals on the skin. Many
teen indoor tanners, however,
exceed by a great deal the amount
of UV exposure required for healthy
Vitamin D levels.

Despite the popularity of the
book, it was actually banned from a
San Antonio high school reading
list because it mentioned Playboy
magazine by name.

Other critics of Blume’s novel,
which is about a young Jewish girl
coming of age, have said it should
be banned from school libraries
because its major themes are sex
and the mocking of Christian
behavior. A .

Seate prefaced the reading of
her chosen except by saying,
“Without this book, girls wouldn’t
get their periods.”

After Seate read, Lawrence
Connolly, a local science fiction
writer and a high school teacher,
read from “Flowers for Algernon,”

. by Daniel Keyes._

At least one student —— Emily
Held, a junior English major at Pitt
-— came to Wednesday’s book read-
ing specifically to see Connolly.

“Flowers for Algernon” has
been banned at least once in
Pennsylvania, in an Emporium high
school, because of a sexual
encounter that the protagonist expe-
riences.

Phat Man Dee said some critics

Shame-based punishment appropriate

After a tragic accident in Butler
County, the district attorney’s office
is taking a unique approach to pun-
ishment.

On June 15, 2003, Jennifer
Dawn Langston, who had been
drinking and was talking on her cell
phone, lost control of her pickup
truck and collided head—on with a
vehicle_ Glenn Clark was driving.
Clark was killed, and his wife
Annette is still in a coma — doctors
believe she has no hope of recovery.
While in her coma, Annette gave
birth to Michael Anthony.

A simple, cut-and-dried convic-
tion of vehicular homicide carrying‘
a mandatory sentence of three years
would seem appropriate — but in
this case, it was impossible. It took
nearly two hours after the crash to
get Langston’s blood-alcohol level
tested, making the results next to
useless and the case against her
quite weak.

Instead, the D.A.’s office and the
families of the victims have come up
with an appropriate way to punish
Langston. H I A

In additionto a 30.—da_y= jail sen-
tence, six months of "house arrest and
five years of probation, Langston is
required to pay $50 a month to
Michael Anthony, who is being
raised by an aunt and uncle.

She must also carry a picture of

Glenn and Annette in her wallet,
place ﬂowers on the crash site every
year on the anniversary of the crash
for the next five years, stay out of
bars and taverns that serve alcohol,
send a letter of apology to Mars Area
High School -—— where Glenn Clark
was a gym teacher and wrestling
coach —— and spend eight hours each
month either working with trauma
victims or speaking to the communi-
ty about the dangers of drunk dri-
ving. _

Since the case against Langston
was so weak, this shame-based
approach to punishing her is ideal. If
she has any remorse in her heart, this
punishment will keep her mistake
fresh in her mind. The potential for
her to be actually rehabilitated, if

spend three years rotting in an over.-

crowded jail. . 
Rather than being a burden -on

taxpayers  further clogging jails,

Langston h_as the potential to, not

only ch_an.ge,herself, but also affect
othersby "speaking out against drunk
and irresponsible behavior.

If L‘a._ngs-ton doesn’t- take her ’

punishment seriously, she’s still fac-
ing jail time, house arrest and proba-
tion — which, in the face of regret-
tably useless evidence, are the least
she /can b_e made to bear.

Califdrnia recall good for a laugh, at least

The California recall has me totally
hooked. I cannot stop watching
Schwarzenegger not answer questions,
and try to explain his sexist approach to
the female gender. I love watching the
Democrats cut each other’s throats, and
the fact that no one even talks about good
ol’ Gray Davis any longer.

I was living in California during the

"debacle this summer. All these yuppie

Republican kids kept bothering me to
sign their petition to recall the governor.
I once asked one of these soldiers of

'darl<r1ess why he‘ felt it was necessary,

and his response was, “Well he screwed

__-..c'up the power, L.A. had to turn its lights
she takes her punishment seriously,_,-‘
is far greater. than if she were to.

off!” _I hope the silence that ﬁlled my
brain after such a statement
can never be reproduced. I
stared, then asked him about
Enron, and, well, the conver-
sationonly caused me more
pain than pretzels cause
Bush.

I had no idea you could
recall an election until I
arrived in California. It. is
amazing what a conserva-
tive, multimillion-dollar
campaign can do to expedite
the implosion of democracy.
I love the notion of popular initiative. I
wish Pemisylvania had it, but itstrikes
me that this was a clear abuse of power.

Darrel Issa single-handedly funded
the entire recall initiative in order to slide
into the throne of governor himself. As

soon as his devilish plan to recall the"

governor came to fruition, over a hun-
dred candidates took advantage of his
investment. V

I was stopping by my usual coffee
shop and theentire front page of the San
Francisco Chronicle read, “RECALL.”
No one could believe what was going on.
The usually lackadaisical citizens of the
Republic of Berkeley were in an uproar.

And then, in a move that would have

    

Josh Ferris
Columnist

made P.T. Barnum the proudest man

ever, the California recall race ‘got under
way. Gary Coleman, the Terminator,

Larry Flynt and gads more paid their ﬁl-

ing fee and are now on the ballot. The cir-‘
cus of the West had moved to center

stage for all of America to watch with

anticipation.

Am ‘I entertained by all of this?
Quite. Do I know the point of it? No, I do
not thinkl do. California has one of the
biggest economies in the world. As of
right now they have no money, so at first

glance, it seems" ludicrous to spends mil- «

lions of dollars on an election. Alas, if
this is what the people wanted, then so be
-it. The rest of us get to kick back and
watch the spectacle.
Issa was soon to be out
of the race, crying like a.
freshrnan’s mother. I guess I-
would be sad, too, if I spent
my fortune trying to over-
throw the‘ republic, only to
have some movie star move
in and crush every one of my
dreams. I laughed, he cried;
it was a menagerie of emo-
tions.
And while everyone is
- A preparing their campaigns,
and defending their sultry lives, Gov.
Davis turned to God. Even his own lieu-
tenant governor joined the race, leaving
Davis alone in Sacramento. If the recall
fails, I think Davis should call all of the
Democrats who ran to take his job and
tell them to “suck it.” Instead of the
Democrats focusing every penny into a
campaign to make the recall fail, they
decided to go for the gold. Due to

absolutely no Democratic cohesion, la 8

Republican may actually run the state of
California in a few weeks. ‘

Maybe it won’t happen, though. ”

Those angels from the ACLU convinced

George W. ponders scale-like balance of Operation Pipe Dreams

From the desk of the President of the United States:

My fellow Americans, the scale-like balance of the war
on terror tipped further toward the side of good last week,
when one of the world’s leading terrorists was ﬁnally appre-
hended. Although our searches for Osama bin Laden and
Saddam Hussein have proven tougher than the
best of the “Where’s Waldo?” series, I have
captured a far more sinisterly heinous villain: ‘
Tommy Chong. Chong, or the “Ace of
Deuces” in our little terrorism card game, can
no longer spread his stupid, ridiculous message
across the globe. I would like to remind all
Americans that that is my job.

In what was a long, tedious and lengthy
intelligence—gathering process, “Operation
Smoke Out” began with the CIApresenting me
with evidence that Chong was looking to the
“country” of “Africa” to obtain elements of

 

David J. McCarthy

Columnist

ijuana directly causes a person to become “high.” Because
Mama used to keep her best china on the top shelves when I
was just a little Texan, she always warned me to stay away
from “high” things. This leads me to the conclusion that if
marijuana causes “higlmess” and high things are bad, ..then
marijuana must be bad. And since my studies also indicate
‘ that, since bongs directly cause marijuana,
bongs to are also “not good.”

Since the ﬁne members of this country
have the armoying habit of demanding proof

like to present a shocking scenario of terror.
Unconﬁrmed, made—up intelligence ﬁnds a
direct link between Tommy Chong and the
Sept 11, 2001, attacks. Just think about all the
smoke you saw pouring out of the wreckage
that was our World Trade Towers. You have to
ask yourself, “Could this possibly just be burn-
ing engine fuel, or was this the mark of a

I glass, metal and glow—in-the—dark decals.

Despite the evidence being unsubstantiated and denied by all
of my top advisors, I jumped to the conclusion that Chong
was up to something. Yes, he was trying to build a bong.
Luckily for American freedom, agents of Operation
Pipe Dreams intercepted Chong before his dastardly terror-
istic plot could be plotted. Rest easy, parents of this great

country. VV1th Tommy Chong behind bars, the world, per- a

haps even all of America is now safe: safe from the evil jihad
of marijuana. The bil]ion—dollar scientiﬁc studies that I have
commissioned have scientiﬁcally proven that smoking mar-

‘ deranged, bong—smoking overlord of power?”
I’m not going to name any names, but I’d just like to say that
I think Tommy Chong did it. .

Despite the fact that Chong is incarcerated, action must
be taken to prevent his message of anti-American. hatred
from corrupting our youth. His propaganda-spewing ﬁlms
such as “Up In Smoke” may teach our children that it is okay
to question the established government views on what is and
is not acceptable, and nothing is more important to a free
society than the censorship of controversial topics. I have
located several terrorist training camps, aka video store,

existing within our own country. Ofﬁcials from Operation
Pipe Dreams are working to eliminate all of Cheech and
Chong’s videos and replace them with wholesome, all’-
American tales, such as ¢“Black Hawk Down,” “Full Metal
Jacket,” and “Three Kings.”

I would also like to support the ﬁne work of the oﬂicers
of Pittsburgh, or “Knowledge Town” as I so idiotically like
to refer to it, for their anti-terror work Despite the fact that
Knowledge Town’s police force has been drastically reduced
due to budget problems, I would like to commend them on
still making drug paraphernalia busts a top priority, even with
violent crime ever more apparent in Oakland. The recent

sentencing of Tela Ropa owner and terrorist Richard Kevin '

J aussen should help keep our streets safe. Just last week,
three visibly stoned college students viciously attacked two
bags of Doritos and three extra-large Slurpees. Is this the kind
of society we want to live in? While a Social Security vacu-
um, dangerous oil—dependency and a scarily bad economy
are problems -I just can’t seem to solve, rest assured that there
are fewer devices for marijuana smoking on the street than
before I took oﬂice. e I

In closing, I would like to ask Congress for $420 billion
to further aid Operation Pipe Dreams and the war on terror.
Goodnight, and may God bless America and cast all the
other countries into hell;

Studies have shown that reading this column may directly
cause you to think Operation Pipe Dreams is a waste of time
and money. For further study. details, e-mail David J at

Books can’t take the place of personality

Gore cheers,

When I ﬁrst read ‘The Catcher in the
Rye,” in seventh grade, I did so hoping to
ﬁnd someone I could become. a

I was a boy in search of an identity.

I had heard good things about Holden
Caulﬁeld -—— that he was interesting and
people could relate to him — so I creased
the ﬁrst page and anxiously awaited the
poetic insights that would allow me to bet-
ter understand myself and act accordingly.

I took my venture seriously and grew
cynical as I tried to imitate that boy whose
sister accused him of “never enjoying any-
thing.” '

And then, after reading the end, I real-
ized that Holden Caulﬁeld, though literary
and mysterious, was not the best person to
look up to if I wished to be happy.

My life went on like that for a while. I
liked to be serious about things and
searched for a ready—made mold of tem-
perament and morality that I co111d slip
into. .

I needed a rational paradigm for the
world; a set of objective truths that could
give me motivation towards something.

I needed to assume a role.

I became deeply religious for a while,
and that eventually gave way to the novels
of Ayn Rand, which allowed me to be an
ideological fool I’m almost embarrassed to
remember, although it was nice to know
everything.

It took me a long time to realize that
my ideas and actions weren’t my own, nor

did they apply to things as they really were.

I didn’t see that my stark adherence to
the identity I had chosen led to more drama
than resolution, or that I was the puppet of
the role I had assumed.

Most people don’t pick roles as
encompassing as the ones I did. Most peo-
ple tend to fragment them-
selves.

They behave as a conserv-
ative toward this, a liberal
toward th_at, a relativist here and
a moralist there.

 

counselor: “Johnny, don’t worry about
being like anyone else. Justbe yourse .”
But I’ve been trying to get to some-

thing deeper than that.

We all like to have a purpose; to feel

like we’re adhering to something greater

than ourselves.

And assuming a role, or
any sort of dogma —
whether it be Christianity,
liberalism or just trying to be

V tidy — can help us to do that

But more often than not,

They want to be this sort of it only leads to frustration

which are often adhered to even

more dogmatically: “I will be

the type of person that always keeps every-
thing neat and tidy.” Or, “I won’t tolerate
my boyﬁiend’s smoking.” Or, “I will be the
person who is always happy and‘ cheers
other people up.”

And it’s these little things that help ful-
ﬁll our occasional, irrational, desire to be
dramatic and ruin things.

I Things work well for a while, but in
the end, you ﬁnd yourself sacriﬁcing your
own happiness to abide to the characteris-
tics of your role. '

Now, I guess all of this may seem like
a bad pep talk from a high school guidance

P This isn’t a call to the
phonies of the world.

It’s meant more as a plea against any -

sort of dogma. . .
Because no good can come when you
begin to view an abstract truth or idea of
what you should be as more important than
the circumstances before you.
So, forget yourself and lighten up.

he says some idiotickitsch line. But now,
Arnold has been forced into answering

in a few orgies.

This is far too scandalous for my
taste, which is why I think Larry Flynt is
the best candidate for governor. He is a

self-described smut-peddler who cares. _

The man has gone to the Supreme Court
to defend our right to free speech. By any

-standard, he seems to be a very good

businessman who could help the state
with its ﬁscal woes. If we decided to
ﬁght for popular initiative and then recall
our governor, I hope Mr. Flynt would
come and run here.

Lost in brilliance

Lost in Translation

Starring Bill Murray and Scarlett
Johansson

Directed by Sofia Coppola
<£n.“n,“rl‘r

CHAD EBERLE
Senior Staff Writer

“Lost in Translation” is the best ﬁlm to
be released this year. A

And with it, writer/director Soﬁa
Coppola ofﬁcially becomes at least as cool
as her father, Francis Ford Coppola. And to
think, we were all so bitter when Dad cast
her in “The Godfather Part III.”

“Lost” is a lovely, . spectacular ﬁlm
about two people alone together in an
overpopulated country. VV1th its simplicity,
the way Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte
(Scarlett Johansson) ﬁt together without
complication or reservation, it’s like a
melancholy “Punch-Drunk Love.”

The setting is Tokyo, Japan. Bob is an
aging American movie star there to shoot a
whiskey commercial for a quick $2 mil-
lion. Charlotte is along for the ride with her
husband (Giovanni Ribisi), who is busy
photographing a band.

Bob and Charlotte don’t speak the lan-
guage and can’t sleep. In addition, Bob’s
heyday as an actor has long passed, and
he’s struggling to get along with his wifeof
25 years —- his trip is a “break” from her.
Charlotte doesn’t know what to do with the
philosophy degree she just earned from

g Yale, and she is thinking twice about her

marriage. They’re “lost” in Tokyo and in
life. But they’re also free — in their isola-
tion from everything around them except

each other — to behave with abandon and
have an utterly pure friendship.

Johansson is not only one of the most
capable actresses of her generation, but
also one of the smartest —— add this ﬁlm to
a track record thatincludes wonderful odd-

ities like “Ghost World” and “The Man -

Who Wasn’t There.” As Charlotte, she’s
natural and heartbreaking. And that open-
ing shot — my God, it’s too much.

And Murray —— he’s still brilliant and
still making ﬁlms that will be highlights of
his career. No actor stays brilliant this long.
His Bob is hilarious and uagic. Back in the
’ 805, could anyone have seenthis coming?
The dramatic ability‘ that. the actor, has
recently shown —— alongside his still-sharp

comedy —— in ﬁlms like : this‘ and.

“Rushmore,” represents a breakout that’s
more surprising than the one Tom Hanks
made in the mid ’90s.

Even Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris,
in tiny roles, create memorable characters.

Beyond the note—perfect perfor-
mances, the look and sound of the ﬁlm
match the beauty of Coppola’s script.
Lance Acord’s cinematography is low-key
but stimning, and the music by Kevin
Shields of My Bloody Valentine is perfect-
ly moody.

Yes, Soﬁa Coppola is the real thing.
She manages to top her spellbinding and
-similarly melancholy debut, “The Virgin
Suici ,” with a ﬁlm that’s small but ‘enor-
mously touching and, in its own way,
earth—shattering.

If you have any love for cinema, do
not miss “Lost in Translation.”

“Lost in Translation” opens in -theaters
F ruiay, September 26.

COURTESY Focus FEATURES

Th erl ojct has  

something it wants to   say

The Things We Say
The Berlin Project

Orange Peal Records
i‘r*£r<k

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

It’s great to see more and more local
bands attracting listeners from other
parts of the country and putting
Pittsburgh on the music map.

The-Berlin Project is doing just that.
With a new sound and a new direction,
their new album, The Things We Say,
brings a fresh taste of great local music.

The Berlin Project formed eight
years ago, when lead guitarist and
singer John Garrighan started playing
‘music with a group of his friends at the
age of 14. Both the lineup and sound
have changed over the years.

The Berlin Project used to play

more of a ska sound, but now the band

is more mature, with a solidiﬁed lineup,
including lead singer, and guitarist Jon’
Belan, bassist Chuck Rocka, drummer
Nick Revak and Aaron Mediate on the

keyboard. The Berlin Project has made i

a solid rock album that has a touch of
punk to it, but they are more of a mod-

em-rock band than a punk band.

The lyrics on this album are a far
cry from the anthems of pulling up to
the drive-through window at Taco Bell.
The songs on The Things We Say are
about relationships, break-ups and life.

The title track is one of the high-
lights of this album, a song about rela-
tionships that ﬁzzle, and it has an ‘80s
John Hughes teen-movie feel: “If I can
speak emotionally or you can read my,
mind/ you’d know just what I feel like
on the inside/ If you can say you under-
stand, but tell me you won’t try/ To
make these feelings happen like they
used to/ It’s OK, I’ll be ﬁne.”

In the song “Walking Papers,” they

» sing about leaving a messed up relation-

ship and ﬁnally being free: “I’m moving
on, while you were crying, I was laugh-
ing in the hallway/There’s something
wrong, while it will take you months,

7 but I’ll be fine today.”

When bands change the direction
they take with their music, it‘ is some-
times a good move, though sometimes it
doesn’t help the band at all. But with
this change in direction, The Berlin
Project is taking a huge step towards
major success that could be a big move
for both themselves and other Pittsburgh
bands. ‘ A

Woody’s doing his thing 

Anything Else

Starring Jason Biggs, Christina
Ricci, Woody Allen

Directed by Woody Allen
skirt/2

CHAD EBERLE
Senior Staff Writer

At the beginning of “Anything
Else,” it seems Woody Allen may
have broken the cycle and given us
something new. The director has
been averaging a film a year for
decades now —— a remarkably fast
pace in Hollywood —— and the last
handful of films, though mostly
pleasant watches with a few good
laughs each, haven’t been anywhere
near the -caliber of his best works:
classics like “Annie Hall” and
“Manhattan.” .

The first hint that “Anything
Else” could be an aberration in the
director’s career is its cinematogra-
phy. The film is beautifully shot in
scope by Darius Khondji. If memo-
ry serves, Allen has used wide-
screen photography only once
before in all his years of directing
in the aforementioned
“Manhattan” and his films
haVen’t looked this alluring in
years.

The second surprise is that
Allen isn’t the one romancing the
hot young actress in the film. He’s
stepped aside, opting for a sec-
ondary role, to focus on the more
age—appropriate, if less interesting,
Jason Biggs, whom the director
inexplicably trusts to narrate direct-
ly to the camera.

Biggs is Jerry Falk, a mild—man-
nered comedy writer with a girl-
friend, Amanda (Christina Ricci),
who is, to put it mildly, a handful.
His friend and mentor, David Dobel
(Allen), is either brilliant or psy-
chotic; Those are just the primary

crazy people in his life. There’s also ‘

his mother-in—1aw (Stockard
Channing) who’s moved into his

apartment and his inept but good— D

hearted agent (Danny Devito) who
Jerry can’t bring himself to fire.

Despite the early promise of the
film, Allen still lacks his edge.

The script revolves around Jerry
and crew, waiting for one-liners and
never really taking shape. Like
many of the director’s recent
efforts, the film feels as if it was
conceived and produced way too
damned comfortably to be inspired.
It is underwritten — a few actors,
including Devito and Jimmy Fallon,
are largely stranded — but, at the

get me wrong; it’s not that bad a

recent work, it’s decent.

Is there anything exceptional?
Besides the look of the film, there’s

’ Ricci, who’s so good at acting neu-

absurd, but rings true.

So maybe Allen doesn’t have
another classic in him; maybe I
should just be happy with the dozen
or so laughs he provides every year

something novel, rather than just
passable. One more great film
would be better than another decade
of decent ones.

SparXXx’s deliverance doesn’t involvedueling banjos

Deliverance
Bubba Sparxxx
Interscope
a“r<l‘x1 /2

SHANI ALSTON
Staff Writer \

Bubba Sparxxx, the good 01’
country boy of rap, is back with his
second album, Deliverance. This
autobiographical sophomore CD
takes a look at the life of Bubba
Sparxxx, from his beginnings in
deep—country Georgia to his insecu-
rities about the possibility of being

a one-hit wonder after his first sin-
gle, “Ugly.”

Fusing country music and rap
might seem like a crazy idea, but
with the first three tracks on
Deliverance, Bubba Sparxxx shows
listeners that he can make the com-
bination work. These songs feature
a coi1ntry—song hook, with
Sparxxx’s low, carefully spoken
raps backed by twanging guitars,
banjos and harmonicas playing dur-
ing the Verses. Sparxxx isn’t afraid
to emphasize his southern roots,
often making fun of himself by rap-
ping about being a hick or just

wanting money in order to buy ‘a
keg of beer and another pig.
However, he doesn’t just stick with
this one formula.

Timbaland,‘ the rapper/producer
behind Missy Elliot and Aaliyah,
worked with Sparxxx on his first
album and continues their relation-
ship on. Deliverance. Traditional
hip-hop beats are scattered through-
out the album, including
“Hootenanny,” which features

Justin Timberlake singing a smooth
R&B hook while Sparxxx raps
about defying those who doubt his
success. While this song follows an

_ another

already established pop-rap formula
that guarantees Sparxxx “will have
radio play in the future, many
tracks try to create something new.

Sparxxx gets personal in
“Nowhere,” rapping about the
struggleto become a rap artist. The
song has a unique, flowing beat
behind the vocals and has an almost
gospel—music feel. “She Tried” is
look into the life of
Sparxxx; he raps about lost love in
a voice filled with regret.

As fast as Sparxxx gets serious,
he returns to the comical, upbeat
songs he became known for after
“Ugly.” “Like it or Not” is .a funky
dance track that uses drums, guitars
and horns. 'It’s a welcome change
from the keyboards and synthesiz-
ers used elsewhere on the album.

The new ideas and beats on.

Deliverance assure that Sparxxx is
not suffering from any sophomore
slump. While his first album might
have pegged him as an Eminem
wannabe, his second album
demands respect. Instead of trying
to imitate other established rappers,
Sparxxx tries to find his own sound.

If Deliverance is any indication,’

Sparxxx’s search did "not "end up in
vain. '

THE PITT NEWS

Shaking the dust off Metropol P

JOSH COHEN .
Senior Staff Writer

On the brink of releasing its fourth
album, Seasons, which hits store
shelves Oct. 7, road veteran Sevendust
is currently headlining a string of club
shows. After taking the last several
months off to record a new album, the
southern metal band should be as ener-
getic and awe—inspiring as ever.

Sevendust has already earned an
underground “legendary” status among
fans for a touring pace that would leave
most bands sore just reading the itiner-
ary. Tonight, members of Sevendust
once again find themselves doing what
they do best: performing live.
Pittsburgh fans should consider them-
selves lucky; tonight’s show will be the
last intimate setting Sevendust will
treat fans to -—— the band catches up
with Staind for a nation-wide tour later

in the week.

Sevendust is sure to rock the house
with a blend of classic jams, such as
“Black” and “Wafﬂe,” and some new,‘
unreleased material from its forthcom-
ing LP.

Drummer Morgan Rose is sure to
be a crowd pleaser, presenting a rhyth-
mic delivery of‘ ambidextrous blast
beats and ear-candy cymbal ﬁlls. His
stage presence will surely leave even

I. the best local drummers asking them-

selves, “Is he real?” The answer is yes;
the robotic movements, the impeccable
timing, the unrelenting screams and
spit ﬂying over the cymbals and
towards the crowd are all very real.
Vocally, Sevendust covers all of
the angles. With lead vocalist [Lajon
Witherspoon and three other perform-
ing vocalists within the instrumental
section of the band, these lads will

- more than fill the room with solid

screams and excellent clean vocals.

A band that has more punch to its
sound than a lumberjack fight-club,
Sevendust will surely turn the ﬂoor of
Metropol into a frenzy of sweating,
screaming, body-checking fans, who
will spread the love of music by tossing

 

each other violently in “the pit.”

Sevendust has made Metropol an
annual stop over the past few years,
and with every performance, it leaves
the Pittsburgh scene with a taste of
what a hard-working, fan-dedicated,
wholesome group of artists should be.
Rather than just wasting another $18 at
the bar on “Thirsty Thursday,” give
your brain cells a taste of a healthy
high with music from a band that is
sure to uplift.

Sevendust will play -an all—ages Show at
Metropol tonight, Sep. 25, at 8 pin.
Tickets are $8. For tickets call (412)

Pitt midﬁelder Johnathan Clow bbls el.  action are ts season. Cl scor the game’s ‘only goal.

Pitt loses at SetonHall, 2-  

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team took the
ﬁeld against No. 23 Seton Hall on
Saturday, but came up one goal short for
the fourth time this season, losing 2-1.

Seton Hall (3—1—2 Overall, 1-0-2 Big
East) applied offensive pressure
throughout the first half, outshooting
Pitt (2-5-0 Overall, 1-2-0 Big East) 10-
3.

The Pirates struck ﬁrst, taking
advantage of a rniscommunication by
Pitt defenders. Defender Clay Haﬂich
chased the ball as it rolled towards his
own goalkeeper, Justin Lowery. Haflich
rnisheard Lowery and let the ball go,
thinking Lowery was going to get it.
Lowery was on another page and
thought that Haﬂich was going to clear
it himself.

_ “It was a lack of communication,”
Haﬂich said. “I thought he said ‘let it

799

go.
This rniscommunication allowed

Seton Hall senior midfielder Luke

Vercollone to close in and take the free
shot on net. The goal was unassisted and
put the Panthers behind 1-0 just 7 min-
utes, 37 seconds into the game.

The second half was much like the
ﬁrst. Seton Hall again applied strong
offensive pressure as it outshot Pitt 7-4.

The Pirates came close to increasing
their lead when John Goncalves had his
shot ring off the post and glide along the
goal line. Panther defenders cleared the
ball before it rolled across the line.

With less than nine minutes left in

the game, Seton Hall sealed the victory’

with what would prove to be the game-
winning goal. Vercollone passed the ball
to the center, and Sacha Kljestan shot

the ball past Lowery from 15 yards out. -

The goal came at the 81:10 mark and
put the Pirates up 2-0.
The Panthers rallied late, but came

up short.'Less than a minuteafter Seton
Hall’s second goal, Johnathan Clow
scored to cut the lead to 2-1. The play
occurred when Panthers’ midﬁelder
Mike Cunha crossed the ball to the rnid—
dle. Clow came slashing in and kicked
the ball to the upper right comer of the

net. The goal came at the 82:33 mark.

Lowery finished the game with six
saves. Pirates’ freshman goalkeeper Ian

Joyce recorded ﬁve saves.

The Panthers were outshot in the
game 17-7, and, again, offense was a
problem.

“We had quality opportunities,”
Coach Joe Luxbacher said. “We [have]
to make the best of [our] opportunities.”

Both teams had great scoring
chances, but neither was able to make

the best of their chances.

“Ihe game could have [easily] been

. 5-4,” Luxbacher said. “We just have to

keep battling to get over the hump,”
Luxbacher said

The Pitt football team carmot afford to
roll over and play dead this time.

Two years ago, Pitt suifered a devastat-
ing loss to aniobviously weaker opponent,
South Florida Anybody who was a Pit
football fan two years ago probably still has

« not recovered from the loss — or the four

games that followed.’

The Panthers were supposed to beat
South Florida The game was not even sup-
posed to be close, but somehow, South
Florida opened a 14-0 lead on the Panthers
in the first quarter and never looked back

South Florida was up by as much as 28-
7 before PitI.’s offense attempted to mount a
comeback as it cut the lead to 28-26, but
eventually it came up short when South
Florida made the score 35-26 with a touch-
down.

A four game losing streak followed,
which included losses to Miami, Notre
Dame, Syracuse and "Boston College. Of
course, the 2001 season had a happy ending
with a 34-19 Tangerine Bowl victory over
North Carolina State, but this is not this sea-
son’s happy ending. Panthers; fans want a
national and Big East title.

' Even though the play—by-play from last‘

weekend’s 35-31 loss__ to unranked Toledo is
diﬁerent, the theme remains the same. .
The Rockets’ offense dominated our
defense. Come on, fellas! You are supposed

Rollman capitalizes on transfer from Iowa State to Pitt

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Sarah Rollman is tall, but don’t tell her that
— she already knows.
While being tall gets her plenty of stares and

‘ strange looks, her height has allowed the 6—foot~ V
1-inch Rollman to be successful as an’ outside

hitter on Pitt’s volleyball team.

After transferring from Iowa State, Rollman,
_ started for the.Panthers during her junior year,

playing in all 29 matches and helping Pitt post a
20—wi'n season. Rollman ranked third on the team
with 314 kills and was second in digs with 261.

This year, Rollman has picked up where she
left off, with her latest accomplishment coming
after last weekend’_s Pittsburgh Classic. Rollman
was one of three Panthers named to the All-
Tournament team. _.

The Pitt News: What’s your favorite thing about
playing volleyball?‘ ‘

Sarah Rollman: I think it’s one of the ultimate
team sports. One person cannot do it all, you
have to have everybody contributing. You can’t
hit the ball twice in a row and you can’t hit the
ball over or you’re never going to win. I think
that part of it I really like, but it’s also ultra-com-
petitive, and we just love to hit the crap out of
the ball and block other people. It’s just’ so
explosive and so much fun.

TPN: Does having to depend on each other make

the team closer?

SR: It takes a lot of trust. You have to know that
your teammates are going to bethere for you and
you’re going to be there
for them. It takes a lot,
but because we’ve all
been playing for so long
and because we have the -
love for it, it comes nat-
urally.

TPN: What made you
want to come to Pitt?

SR: I knew I had to

leave [Iowa State]. That situation wasn’t work-
ing. I really enjoyed the girls when I came out. I
enjoyed my teammates at my other school, too,
but these girls, I just fit with them very well.
Also, [head coach] Chris [Beerman] is the
biggest ass-kicker ever. You want that in a coach
and you know that the fact that he’s always there,
ready to kick butt, just “makes you want to be
there too.

TPN: What’s the biggest difference in being at
Pitt rather than at Iowa State?

SR: Well, the fact that it’s in the city. I’ve expe-
rienced the small—town campus and I’ve experi-
enced the city campus. I like the city. I like the
fact that there are so many options for us to do
and more places to go out.

TPN: What’s your favorite sport other than vol-
leyball?

SR: Football. [laughs] It’s another
team sport. The offense needs the
defense, and everybody on offense
needs each other. Also, you just get
to hit. [laughs] If I could play, I
would ‘play football. My family
always has a tackle football game at
Christmas.

.TPN: What goes through your mind
before each play?

SR: My high school coach used to call it ‘life
between context.’ In between when the server
serves, you’re thinking about how I’m going to
pass this ball, and as soon as you pass the ball,
you think ‘where’s the setter going to set,’ and
you’re moving. '

TPN: ‘Life between context’ sounds kind of
philosophical. ‘

SR: It’s just not standing and watching. There’s
always something you should be doing, some-
where you should be moving between each con-
text. [laughs] He is a very philosophical-type,
veryimental coach.

Women’s tennis preps for season atBucknell Classic

AUSTIN HERTZOG
Staff Writer

Members of the Pitt women’s_ten—
nis team traveled to Bucknell
University over the weekend to com-
pete in the Bucknell Fall Classic, a tour-
nament that the team participates in as
preparation for the regular season.

The tournament featured six ﬂights
of singles and doubles, in which the
Panthers entered two women each in
Flight A and B singles, one pairing each
in Flight A and B doubles, and one par-
ticipant in Flight C singles.

In the A ﬂight, Pitt entered Becky

Emmers and Anne Davies, who both
lost their first-round matches, but
Davies was able to win one match dur-
ing back draw play.

Emmers was defeated by
Georgetown University’s Jordan Botj er,
6-1 and 6-3, in the opening round. She
was then given the opportunity to play
another match in the back draw, but
came up short against Lida Hokkanen
of Bloomsburg University, losing in
two sets, 6-2 and 6-3.

In Davies’ first match against
Bucknel1’s Tanya Sichko, Davies came
back from a 6-0 ﬁrst set loss and was
able to even the match after taking the

second set, 6-2.

Unfortunately, Davies was unable
to keep the momentum from her see-
ond-set win, and lost the tiebreak, 10-4,
giving the match to Brown with scores
of 6-0, 2-6 and 10-4.

Davies moved‘ on to the back draw
and came away with a win against
Bloomsburg’s Julianne Bramante, 6-3
and 6-2. Then, in the third round of the
back draw, Davies was knocked out of
the tournament by Marist College’s
Yana Tikhonko 8-4. ,

In the B ﬂight, Pitt’s Hayley
Hughes came back from being down a
set to defeat Georgetown’s Lara

ond-round match, Hughes played into a‘

third—set tiebreaker, but came out on the

-‘losing end, this time, falling to

Duquesne’s Jackie Hughes, 7-6, 4-6,
and 10-7.

Also in Flight B, Emily Hughes

her second round match, Hughes took

The Panthers’ Konita Jude played A

in the C ﬂight and had difficulty in her

Marist’s Courtney
McGeever, 3-6, 7-6, and 10-3.

Rhoads and Panthers’ defense
need to figure out malfunction

t Nash, page 20

“National Title? Don’t talk about a
National Title! National Title? Are you kid-
ding me?’I’m just hoping we can win anoth-
er game!”

The defense is better than its perfor-
mance on Saturday. It lost ﬁve starters this
season, and maybe the defense just needs
time to gel.

Let’s chalk it up to the fact that maybe 6
the Panthers did exactly what Harris said
they were not going to do. Maybe they over-
looked Toledo and were looking ahead to
this weekend’s opponent, Texas ‘A&M.

Well, Panthers, this weekend’s matchup
down in College Station is your shot at
redemption. This game will be televised on
ABC, and many college football fans around
the country will be able to tune into the
game. _
Show them that last week was just a
lucky week for teams from the Mid-
American Conference against teams ranked
in the toptl5, because I’m not so sure that the
rest of the country is convinced

Believe it or not, college football fans
around the country are paying ‘attention.
Within 20 minutes of the loss to Toledo, I
was bombarded with phone calls from a
friend until I ﬁnally answered my phone so
he could rub _in the loss. Just 20 minutes, and

this game was not even televised.

Well, this game is going to be televised,
and we don’t want to be embarrassed this
weekend. The thing that should be on the
minds of Pitt football players is how the
Aggies walked out of Heinz Field with a 14-
12 victory last season. The wounds should
still be open. ’ V ’

If members of the offense are able put
up career highs, there is no reason why the
Panthers sho11ld not be able to come away
with a victory. There is no reason for a team
to score 31 points and not win a football
game. . ‘

Both sides of the ball have to mesh; oth-

erwise it’s going‘ to be a tough road ahead to
compete for a national title or, for that rr1at—
ter, the Big East Championship. Virginia
Tech and Miami, just to name a few upcom-
ing opponents, can put points on the board,
so Paul Rhoads and the defense had better
get it right. .

Panthers, please do not go down to
Texas A&M and roll over. You are clearly
the better team, and this matchup is your
chance to show this.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports editor for
The Pitt News and is convinced that the
Panthers can come back from last weeks
embarrassing loss to seriously challengefor
the Big East title.

PHILTHY

Being tall isn’t always good, but it helps

Rollman, page 21

TPN: What’s your most memorable
volleyball moment?

SR: In college, it would have to be
last year, when we beat Miami and
Virginia Tech at home. We had our
backs against the wall and we had-
n’t been playing very well, and then
we came out and we beat two really
good teams. In high school, it
would be when we were in the state
championship game my junior year,
or just ‘my entire senior year.
[laughs]

TPN: What’s something that people
would be surprised to know about
you?

SR: That I am the typical Nebraska
farm girl._ [laughs] Not only am I
from Nebraska, but I did grow up on
a farm and I fed cattle and I did all
that good stuff. [laughs]

I TPN: Did you ever get attached to

the cows or the chickens?

SR: Not really. My little brother
definitely did. We got to feed them
with a bottle, and I didn’t like them
very much, so I didn’t get too
attached. They were my pets some-

 STATION SQUARE

* 41 2-566-3666

what, but I didn’t mind when they
went to the slaughterhouse. [laughs]

TPN: So what’s it like to be tall?

SR: [laughs] It has its good and its

bad. You get stared at a lot, and peo-
ple like to remind you that you’re
tall»,-as if you didn’t know it.

TPN: I’m sorry I mentioned it.

SR: Obviously, it has its benefits.
I’ve been able to play sports and do
pretty well at them. I don’t know,
I’ve never known anything else, and
my whole family is pretty tall. I
can’t imagine what it would be like
to be short and have clothing fit.
[laughs]

TPN: If you could dateany celebri-

ty, who would it be‘?

SR: [laughs] I don’t know, I don’t
ever fantasize about celebrities,.but
it would have to be Ben Afﬂeck or
Andy Roddick. You need someone
who is somewhat athletic. I’m used

to that kind of thing. I’d definitely ~

take Ben now that~J—Lo is through
with him. [1aughs]_ ’
