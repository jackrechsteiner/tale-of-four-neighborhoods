S Students lined up before dawn outside of the William Pitt
Union to purchase their tickets for Saturday’s 3:30 p.m. game

against Penn State.

Maher Moussa, a junior working at the information desk
beside the Union’s ticket booth, said students began lining up lon

before the ticket ofﬁce opened at 9 a.m.
- “They started at 6 or 7 [a.m.],” he said.

Students waited in a line that stretched from the ticket win-
dow past the jazz display in the Union, to purchase individual stu-
dent tickets, season tickets or guest passes to the Penn State game.

Guest passes, which sold out before 2:30 pm., were sold to

any student with a ticket, for $15 each.

Single student tickets were sold for $15. Additional non-stu-
dent tickets were for sale for $35 each. Other students opted to just
purchase season tickets for $20 to secure their seat in Three Rivers

Stadium for Saturday.

Junior nursing student Chakeya Fleshman and her friend
Kaleisha Chase, also a junior nursing major, bought their season

tickets just for Saturday’s game.

“We might go to another game to get our moneyfs worth,”

Chase said. '

Fleshman had tried to wait in line earlier, but changed her

mind. I

“Earlier I came and left because it was too’ long,” she said.
By 4:30 p.m., Moussa said, the line had dwindled. At 5:30,
Fleshman said she only had to wait in line for about 15 minutes.

Student Government Board
plans second half of tenure

REHAN NASIR
Editor in Chief

If the ﬁrst Student Government Board
meeting is any indication, Pitt students can
expect to see a lot more of their elected
representatives this term.

Last night’s- ﬁrst meeting drew about
30 students, to the sixth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union. President Joan Snyder
handled the meeting in a tutorial fashion,
explaining the different parts of the
evening and their signiﬁcance for ﬁrst-
time attendees. ‘ t .

“The summer was very busy for
SGB,” said Snyder, as she explained the
new plans for the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Union.
Cubicles and desks will be rearranged to
make for a ﬁiendlier and more open envi-
ronment for student groups, many of
whom call the ﬁfth ﬂoor home. Computer

_ stations and more telephones will also be

added.

Snyder said while the job order had
already been placed to the University,‘
funding for the project is still being decid-
ed.

Student groups can also expect to
have their events posted on a new Web site
that will work as a calendar for students.
The software has already been ordered and
SGB will work with PittTV to develop the
site. ‘ -

Snyder was elated with how well the
freshman programs turned out. More than
750 students were at Club Laga during the
ﬁrst week of school for the welcome back
party, and 952 students attended the Labor

Day barbecue in Schenley Quad. Snyder"

added that SGB will be planning more
events to keep freshmeninvolved at Pitt.

One of those ideas is the Freshman

Peer Mentoring program that ‘Snyder
worked on during the summer. The pro-
gram will be an extension of the Freshman

Bouquet gets laundry facilities

The residents of buildings D, E, F,
G and H of the Bouquet Gardens have
forgone this convenience since the term
began in August. . — -

The ﬁve buildings, which were
completed before the start. of the fall
term, were not equipped with quarter-
operated washers or dryers by the time
students moved in. ,

Today, each building "will receive
one washer and one dryer, ﬁlling them

Ron Cichowicz, assistant‘ director of

Senior citizens keeping
up with undergraduates

LAUREN NAVALKOWSKY A
The Pitt News

For some students, going to col-
lege is a brand-new experience. For
others, it is a trip back in time. In
addition to the 30,000 students at
Pitt this year, 450 senior citizens
have enrolled in the University’s
College for the Over 60 Program.

Many of the senior citizens
graduated from a university earlier
in their lives and are still interested
in learning. ‘

Mortin Markowitz, a 1943 Pitt
engineering graduate, said, “I had
the desire, and the time to study a
different field "I was not able to
before.” '

Markowitz is currently enrolled
in American Political Process,
Classical Greek Literature and
physics. This is the heaviest term of
the 10 years he has spent in the pro-
gram. V

Popular courses in the 26 years

P the program has existed range from

history to architecture. However,
some departments such as computer
science, studio art, physical educa-
tion and film studies have not been
made available. Jan ,White of the

call Shannon or Dave at 648-7983, or stop
by 434 William Pitt Union. A

program’s office of admissions said
those particular courses fill up
immediately and spots cannot be

taken away from the undergraduate

students.
Students in the program can
choose how many credits they wish

to take each term. Some, such as_

Markowitz, have been taking class-
es for several years. Other students
only sign up for one course while
still others enroll in one course
each semester.

While the majority of the senior

students are successful in their pur- _
suits, they are awarded audit grades ’_ ,
rather than the traditional As, Bs

and Cs.‘

Another adjustment the students 4 

are forced to make, other than the

shock of returning to school, is _

their introduction to a world of

young adults, who are in many ,

cases less than half _their age.
This world is sometimes more
liberal, according to Markowitz.
“The students have much, more
freedom .of/ thought and are more
questioning,” he said. ‘ ,
But, he said, the youthful
atmosphere is “more ‘stimulating
and [makes him] feel a little bit
younger.”

Peer Counseling program that ﬁrst year
students are exposed to when they ﬁrst
arrive at Pitt. Snyder said that adding a
mentor to a freshman’s life would help
him or her adjust to the college experi-
ence, both academically and socially.

SGB also managed to get last-
minute shuttle service from Sutherland
Hall to Three Rivers Stadium for the
Kent State game. 2

Board member Jonathan Hoffman
kept his remarks short during the hour-
long meeting and said that SGB would
continue efforts to keep Hilhnan Library
open 24 hours.

The adviser evaluations for the
College of Arts and Science have been
implemented, according to board mem-
ber Dave Lander. Former President
George Mongell introduced the idea.

Another old idea that has come to
fruition is the appearance of police blue
lights which are now around Bouquet
Gardens. More lights have also been
added by the fraternity houses on the hill
and around Sutherland Hall. _

The meeting last night also served to
inform attendees about future committee
meetings and where they will be held.

Some committees, such as govem—
mental relations, have already met and
delivered reports. The governmental
relations committee expressed a strong

desire to get students to vote.
Representatives said they would be hold- .
ing voter education forums and will
launch an intense registration campaign
at the end of September.

The public relations committee also

for you?” campaign. ,

The campaign will reach out into the

boxes, surveys and possibly a radio
show. , - T

Lack of laundry facilities in
Bouquet Gardens is an outrage

Most students are guilty
of it at some point in their college.
careers — wearing the same pair
of pants every day for a week or
maybe two, slipping on the same
pair of socks that you sweated
through the day before, going till
Christmas without washing your

sheets. Serious laundry negli-

gence is widespread at Pittand
probably at just about every other
college campus around the globe.

It is, important to realize,
though, that laundry negligence is
a choice. If you’re a cleanly type
who wants to do his or her laun-
dry twice-daily, you should be
able to, as long as you’ve got the
quarters.

Sadly, students living in phase
II of Bouquet Gardens have been
deprived of this fundamental right
since school began. They had no

- choice — unless the residents of

these washer- and dryer—1ess
buildings wanted to drag massive
heaps of soiled clothing ' to
Litchfield Towers or other facili-
ties, they were forced to live in
filth. -

As these students realized,
laundry machines tend to be a lit-
tle like the crossword puzzle in
your favorite newspaper — you

don’t really miss them until
they’re gone.

According to the University,
laundry machines are due to
arrive at Bouquet Gardens today

—-— but only one washer and one .

pointment as two of each was the
number originally intended.

Only those blessed with stellar

» Dr. ura srpresents Judaismi

Radio talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger
has angered millions with her unfavorable com-
ments about homosexuality. The controversial

*chatmeister reiterated her position during a Sept.

6 appearance on CNN’s “Larry King Live.”‘In
response to Kings queries, Schlessinger declared
ﬂrat the only moral choice for indi-
viduals with a homosexual orienta-
tion is to suppress their feelings.

, .Schlessinger, an observant Jew,
appealed to her religious tradition in
her argument. She claimed that the -

Torah, the cornerstone of Jewish sacred literature,

is clear on matters of sexual morality, and that the

role of a Jewish rabbi is to explain this divine law
to the people.

When King pointed out that Schlessinger’s
ideal rabbi is merely explaining his interpretation
of Jewish law, his guest snapped, “No, not his
interpretation.” She added, “I don’t second-guess
GM 9,

. But King is right The Hebrew Bible, like .
most collections of sacred literature, is a long and
complex body of writings that is open to multiple ~‘

interpretations. Schlessinger is incredibly arro-
gant to assume that her or her rabbi’s interpreta-
tion (yes, interpretation) is the only. valid one.
And she is being either dishonest or willfully
ignorant about the fact that numerous Jewish rab-
bis, in fact, disagree with her on the topic of
homosexuality, and the Torah. " ‘ ‘

In fact, the Jewish world is full of rabbis who
believe that lesbian and gay relationships, com-
plete with sex, are not inherently sinful. And
many of these rabbis go so far as to preside over

religious ceremonies which bless lesbian and gay I

unions. One such forwardthinking individual is
Rabbi Denise Eger, who serves the gay-friendly
Kol Arni- synagogue in West Hollywood, Calif.
(http://www.kol-ami.org).

‘ Featured in the May 1999 issue of the gay

. men’s magazine Genre, Eger aﬂirmed her com-

mitment to  justice for gay people. She also
acknowledged a painful reality, “One of the chal-
lenges for any sexual minority is that the society
around us tries to dehumanize us.” Ironically,
many have found the rhetoric of “Dr. Laura” to be

just such a dehumanizing force. . —

Another rabbi whose approach contrasts
sharply with that of Schlessinger is Ariel
Friedlander, who participated in the Gay and
Lesbian Mardi Gras festival in Sydney, Australia
on March 4 of this year. Ben Hills of the Sydney
Morning Herald reported that
adherents of the Reform branch of
Judaism “turned out in droves” to
cheer on Friedlander, Holocaust
survivor Susie Wise and others
who took part in this celebration of
lesbian and gay pride. ‘

It is not just individual rabbis who oppose
Schlessinger’s na1row—minded position. On
March 29 of this year, the Central Conference of
American Rabbis (http://www.ccametorg) voted
overwhelmingly to allow its members to oﬂiciate
at Jewish same-sex unions. Because the confer-
ence serves at least 1.5 million Reform Jews, this

~was a major aﬂirmation of the moral validity of

committed sarne-sex partnerships.

The big difference between the CCAR and
Schlessinger is that the conference recognizes
that there is a diversity of opinion on this issue
and supports the decision of those rabbis who
choose not to preside at same—sex union cere-
monies. In contrast, Schlessinger refuses to
acknowledge that any other opinion besides her
own might be valid.

And it seems to me that SchlessirIger’s
approach to the Bible is deeply ﬂawed In fact,
most modern Jews recognize that certain sections
of the Torah are bound to a speciﬁc time and cul-
ture, and need not necessarily apply to Jewish life
today. How many Jews, for example, would seri-
ously ostracize a man unfortunate enough to have
lost a testicle due to cancer or an accident
(Deuteronomy 23:1)? And how many modern
Jews participate in the slave trade (

I

25:44-46)? But “Dr. Laura,” whose spiritual ‘

vision appears to be clouded by an irrational fear
of gay people, only sees those scattered verses
which support her ugly agenda

Michael Mazza respects Laura Schlessingeris
right to not engage in lesbian sex.

Capri pants and cargos

When I was in eighth grade I got a
pair of what I called “army pants” dur-
ing the annual back-to-school shopping
excursion that is an essential and recur-
ring part of early adolescence. They
were khaki in color had large pockets
that hung off the sides just above the
knee. I thought they were the coolest
pair ‘of pants I had ever owned.

The first day of class arrived all too
soon, as it always did, and offl strolled
to school. Upon arrival to my ediﬁce of
education I discovered that they were
not, according to my classmates, the
coolest pair of ..pants ever sewn by South
American sweatshop workers. In fact;
my peers thought that the wearing of
such pants granted me a nickname,
which in all seriousness was. the most
ugly and atrocious nickname I have ever
born and would not wish upon anyone.

To my embarrassment and shame I
was soon called Hitler and often hailed
in the hallways with a stiff-armed Nazi
salute by my classmates. They thought
my pants looked like the Nazi Germany
uniform they had seen in our history
textbook. '

Now, 10 years later those “army.

pants” have been labeled “cargo pants”
by Old Navy and are con-
sidered along with capri
pants to" be the hottest
fashions of the new mil-
lennium. Everyone from
‘N Sync and Ozzy
Osbourne to philosophy
professors are sporting them.

CARL

Now I’m not suggesting that those

who wear cargo pants are Nazis.
Military personnel of all nationalities
wore that style of pants during World

War II (U.S. Gen. George S. Patton _

included).
On the contrary, I congratulate you

_ on catching the vision I had so many

years ago. If youare comfortable wear-
ing the cargo or similarly trendy capri
pants, and you think they are cool, more
power to you. .
Nevertheless, that does not erase the
fact that there are still a great many peo-
ple who lament the existence of capri
and cargo pants. It’s as if these people
have nothing better to do than complain
about what someone else wears to

are fresh wardrobe options

school, work and so on‘——- just like my
classmates did 10 years ago when I
wore the “army pants” to the first day of
eighth grade.

My‘ gentle humanity, let’s .be real —
fashion is meant to be fun. Why get
worked up over a pair of pants, let alone
someone else’s pair of pants? ,

If you don’t want to rush to the call
of the Gap — “all the world in khakis”

p—- then don’t.

You have options.

As any punk on Forbes Avenue can
tell you, there are, a ‘variety of other
styles to choose from at your local thrift
store. These styles range from polyester
leisure suits to tight stone—washed jeans.
Or if you really want to change the fash-
ion world, I hear the local department
store is hiring sales personnel in the

. Ralph Lauren Polo department. Maybe

you can work your way up to Ralph’s
personal assistant or even chief designer
someday. -

But most of all, remember that the
cargo and capri fashion trend will fade.
Pretty soon the 1980s styles will be
back! We will all be wearing pink and
purple spandex. _

A All of you who have grown tired of
cargo and capri pants, are you
ready to look like David Lee
Roth on the cover of a Van
Halen album, wearing leopard-
print bikini briefs? Or how
about Madonna when she was
the material girl (before she

became the material morn): with the
black spandex shorts and the see-"

through ﬁsh net shirt and all those jing-
ly tin bracelets? . .
Capris and cargos are a fad. If you
enjoy them, great! May you wear them
well into your 30s. If you hate them,
know that it will most likely get Worse,
(remember what I said about spandex).

So maybe you should consider enjoying ,

the look before it is too late.

Oh, and if you’re still wondering
about my “army A pants” from eighth
grade, I wore them till the knees wore
out. -

Carl Schneider now sports magenta and
violet sequined spandex in the hopes of
staying ahead of the trends. ’

Trendy cioihes...coo| or what?  

T ursomr, SEPTEMBER 12, 2000

  

Capris and other trendy
fashions are pure evil

tion for fear of being blinded by the hor-

If what you wear is supposedto make
a statement, then I am forced to. wonder
what some people are trying to say. I am
talking about today’s fashion trends,
speciﬁcally « those worn by women.
Looking on the streets, in the clubs and
(sadly) in the classrooms as well, it is clear
that many things have gone ‘
out of style — most notice-
ably good taste, color coordi-
nation and appropriate sizes. I
say all that merely to, note the
severe decline in the quality
and originality of clothes worn today.

 

As I see it, the problem stems from the ‘

not—so-recent resurrection and remodeling
of the capli pant Also know-»as".“pedd1e
pushers,” these’ pants have s1owly.crept
out of the grave and into the wardrobe of
nearly every woman on the planet.

These shorter, tighter, hip-hugging
pants loosely resemble the 1960s prede-

cessor. The new capri pants ‘emphasize

what Could quitepossibly be the ugliest
parts of the body, the calves and thighs.
So, why do people rush to the stores

or to their closets to put on these pants that .

make even the skinniest of people? look
like they desperately need another session
with their ThighMaster? I truly do not
know. To see people of all shapes and sizes
try to squeeze their bodies into these
hideously misshapen pants brings pain to
my heart. ‘
Anyone who is bigger than a size two
should not try to wear peddle pushers.'The
problem is ﬂrat a very small percentage of
the female population actually wears a
size two. So, the end result is masses of
women are walking around looking sever-'

E al sizes larger than they actually are. Those

pants combined with the" three—quarter
length shirts leave girls looking like
Popeye. t
‘ “With the ﬂood gates already opened,
hundreds and hundreds of equally disturb-
ing fashion trends swarn their way into the
mainstream. Clothing has gotten increas-
ingly smaller, tighter and brighter — in
termsvof color at least — with each pass-
ing year. . ~
Whoever invented or discovered neon
colors deserves to be kicked in the teeth,

The most baffling thing of all is why
people wear these ugly colors that are
obviously invented for shock Value. It
must be to keep them awake in class. That
' is the only reasonable explana-

tion.

 
 

Another thing I don’t
quite understand is this new
fascination .with thongs. If
someone could explain it to

.me I would really  it. I know

that he or she likes these unﬂattering fash-
ion trends — that’s like saying, ‘yes, I
love looking fatter than I actually am,” or
“I love havingsto wear sunglasses all day
because my shirt is too bright.” _
Why has fashion become an almost
catechismic entity in our-‘everyday lives?
My answer is that it doesn’-pt have to be. It’s
like the cliche says, “curiosity kills the cat-

So, the next time you go to the store,
think about what you are going to buy

Tavia LaFollette, a Pitt grad student, is new to the
Oakland area, but 'she’s no stranger to traveling.
Originally ﬁom New York, LaFollette has traveled
across the country as well as Europe with the paper
mache’ puppets she designs and creates but also per-
forms with. Her puppets have appeared in theater pro-
ductions, as well as inner-city school workshops.

LaFollette takes her puppets to the streets for various.

labor unions events and political demonstrations, as
well. “Mother Jones, ” a 15-foot puppet and spitting

. image of the tum-of-the century radical labor leader of

the same name, even found her way to Japan.

V ‘ The Pitt News: Why puppets?

LaFollette: Because no one can see me! It’s kind of
fun, it’s kind of sneaky. Also, you can jump from char-
acter to character. People can put on performances in a
number of different roles, and switch roles and the
audience won’t even know. I also like the technical
side of building puppets and operating them. I make
everything from really small hand puppets to 16- and

20-foot ones. Some take up to ﬁve people to operate A

them.

: And you work with children too?

LaFollette: I do workshops for chﬂdren in grammar ‘

"school as well as middle and high school. The 
idea is to bring art and theater into the schools where it
is lacking. We’ve gone to public schools in Brooklyn,

Spanish Harlem and the Bronx, as well-as schools in
Europe. I teach students movement, puppet and mask

making, and _then we put on a
performance. We did a perfor-
mance about Bangladesh and

Center and Brooklyn
Children’s Museum.

react to the puppets?
LaFollette: Every country’s
reaction is different. In Japan,
to perform in the street is very
unusual. Asa culture they’re
more subdued, or subtle.
What I do, is very loud and
big. Students are very.recep—
tive, though. The language
barrier isn’t as much of a
problem because so much of
what we do is movement.
People are very responsive to
street performances, too.
People will cross the street to
avoid folks passing out
leaﬂets, but they’re. inter-
ested in ﬂiis.‘ And of
course the media
loves it. It’s visual,
it draws attraction

TPN: Have your
crowds- ever turned dan-
gerous? . I
LaFollette: Actually, I’ve had my live threatened a
few times. In Eastern Europe I was hunting down some
big wigs [to protest their actions] and received threats.
It’s nice for them not to know who you are. It was sort
of exciting for me, because I wasin college at that time,
and thinking “Cool! Espionage!” Some of the people I
was with didn’t think it was as cool as I did, though.

‘TPN: Do you prefer street perfomtance to theater?

LaFollette: 'Ihey’re very diiferent from each other.‘
You can expect the unexpected in street theater. I’ve

been pushed down escalators and almost blown over

from the wind in Chicago at the Sears tower. What’s
fun about street theater is you have all the people
around you responding directly. With the staged theater
the audience just sits back and observes. But then

‘ again, with staged theater you can plan-more, get more

special effects and more people.
‘i

‘ TPN: If you found a portal into John Malkovichis ‘

brain, would you make him your puppet? _
LaFollette: Not him in the ﬁlm. Ifl got to manipulate
him though, I suppose, why not? I don’t want to be him
though. . ' '

woman who has hit the ripe old age of 18, or who’s

day once a year.

What’s so special about this day is that each
woman ‘gets ‘to celebrates it on her own time, in her
own way. Some go to the local clinic to tie one on,
while» others get to sit in plushy waiting rooms
reading Vogue before they strip down and don their
party clothes  err, I mean gowns.

However you spend your particular Pap Smear
Day, I think it’s only appropriate that the nurses and
doctors who are so integral to the soiree help with
the festivities. And what better‘ accompaniment to a
party than with a little music.

And so, here are my top five songs to hear when
visiting the gynecologist:

5. “I Touch Myself” by The Divinyls — hey, at
least I can pretend it’s not a stranger’s hands down
there. « ’

4. “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” by Cyndi

3. “Let’s Talk About Sex” by Salt N’ Peppa -
after all, ‘tis the reason for the season.

2. “Love Hurts” by Nazareth — hell yeah,
something sure hurts! -

And this one goes out to all the ladies 

1. “Like A Virgin” by Madonna — because right
now I wish I was one. ,

So, the next time your Pap Smear Day rolls
around, don’t be afraid to treat it like any other hol-
iday. "Make some cookies in the shape of ovaries
and give them to all of your girlfriends, decorate a
tree with tampons. It’s your day ladies —- do it up

CINDY YOGMAS

Staff Writer

Many say that the Beach Boys’ classic
album, Pet Sounds, inspired everyone who ever
bought it to become a musician. As an American
band, they seemed to have no place in the British
invasion of the ‘60s, but Pet Sounds alone
remains a major inﬂuence and mantra for bands
of all eras.

Adventures in Stereo is proof of that. Their
latest album, Monomania, captures the jangly
pop sounds of the ‘60s without marring it with
the high tech production of the ‘90s ,and makes
it accessible to. kids who haven’t been fortunate
enough to experience music from 40 years ago.
The result is a more pop, less psychedelic, indie
rock tribute .to it. all.

Imagine, if you can, that Brian
Wilson was a girl. Though it would
be a major contradiction to the‘
name Beach Boys, singer Judith
Boyle makes it totally plausible,
even with her sweet soprano
voice. And co-creator Jim Beattie
(formerly of Primal Scream) is an
expert in recreating that nostalgia.

As the Pitt football team prepares to host
rival Penn State in the final scheduled meeting
between the two schools, Pitt head coach Walt
Harris spoke yesterday of a second controversy
in four years concerning the exchange of video-
tapes between the two teams. ,

“I think there’s been some miscommunica—
tion or misleading of obligations of the film
exchange,” Harris said. “I don’t know what the
situation is honestly, but I was coming to work
today and I heard that Coach Paterno was upset.”

There were problems in 1997 when Penn
State head coach Joe Paterno accused Pitt of not
fulfilling the agreement between the teams to
exchange tapes of prior games. Apparently there ‘
are problems again. '

“There was a complaint in 1997, and that
proved to be negative,” Harris said. “And this
one is negative as well.”

-Harris said he did not know the nature of the
complaint. But he did read a statement saying,
“the University of Pittsburgh has met all of its
film exchange obligations with Penn State fully,
and on time. Never once have we personally
received a complaint from Penn State regarding

film exchanges.”

The Pitt coach then took a shot at Paterno,

Chad_Porter scored the lone
goal of the game to propel Pitt’s
men’s soccer team to a 1-0 upset of
2 St. John’s Saturday in
Jamaica, N.Y.

“The win was very important,”
coach Joe Luxbacher said. “All Big
East games are important.”

Porter’s goal, his first of the
season, came almost nine minutes
into the game. Chris Churchill
made a diagonal kick into the
defense and senior Ben Garry won
the ball in the air. Garry knocked
the ball to Porter in front of the net.
The shot beat goalkeeper Bill
Gaudette to give the Panthers all

the scoringthey would_need to win
the game.

Porter and forward Mark Sikora
each had two shots, while Spencer
Barton and Miles Dowiak had one
apiece. Porter was also the only
player to receive a yellow card dur-
ing the game, for What Luxbacher
thought was just aggressive play. ‘

“Chad went after the ball hard,”
Luxbacher said. “The referee
thought it was afoul.”

The Panthers were able to hold
on to the win, even though they
were outshot 13-6. St. John’s also
had -four corner kicks, while the
Panthers had just one.

Knight’s firing was long overdue

Historian Jacob VP. Dunn once

wrote that-the word “hoosier” was a
"term used to describe uncouth per-

sons. Webster’s Dictionary defines
uncouth as “uncultured, crude.” How
appropriate it is then that the mascot
of Indiana University is, the Hoosier,
and that Indiana is the formeremploy-
er of Bobby Knight, an extremely
uncultured and crude

m

Sunday afternoon
after 29 years as the
head basketball coach
at Indiana, following a
number of incidents of.
misconduct and a “pattern
of unacceptable behavior,”
according - to Indiana
University President Myles
Brand. . i I

It’s about time. .

Knight’s ‘behavior during his

‘time at Indiana was totally unprofes-

sional and just plain idiotic, and

should not have been tolerated in any
‘ .capacity._ There have been many inci-
. dents of ;.both I verbal and physical

‘ iabuse against his players, fans and

anyone else who -happened to get in
his way.

gIn’M,ay. Knight was accused of
choking a former player during a

‘ practice in 1997, _an act that ‘was

anKnight was fired  C  

caught on videotape. In response, the
university merely fined Knight and
suspended him for three games, order-
ing him to abide by a “zero—tolerance”
policy. I .
Seemed ‘like a simple‘ enough
request. Butof course, Knight was
unable control his temper and keep his
hands to himself. A confrontation with
a student last week was the last" straw.
He once again embar-
rassed himself, some-
, thing he had done so
many times before.
“Hey, what’s up,
Knight?” was apparently
too casual for Knight to
handle from a student.
So to take matters into
his own hands, he
grabbed his wrist and
told the student to call
him Coach Knight or
Mr. Knight. ’ V

Bielak

' But how in the world did he get 

away with this for so long‘Z, ,
‘I don’t care about his ability as a

basketball coach. I don’t carethat he-

led “Indiana to three national champi-
onships and 11 Big Ten titles. There is
no reason that he had to act in such a
manner -in order to lead his team. It
has been proven many times in a vari-
ety of sports that coaches can be suc-
cessful without being lunatics.

There are other programs in the
nation“ that are achieving success
without dangerous and explosive rant-
ing by their head coach. "While
Indiana has been a prominent force in
college basketball, they are certainly
not an untouchable powerhouse.

Therefore, I cannot even begin to
comprehend why anyone would want

to play basketball for Knight. Why _

would anyone have themselves
degraded and humiliated by this man?
Why do his players not value being

treated and respected as human beings

above playing for a competitive bas-
ketball team? ,

. Brand, who made the decision to
fire Knight, has suddenly become an
extremely unpopular person on cam-
pus. When asked by the media how he
felt about being the person who will
be‘ remembered for,Tgett_ing rid of
Knight, Brand replied, “Bob Knight
got rid of Bob Knight.”

V While there might not be much
support for Brand, II have to say I

strongly support his decision and love

hiscomment on Knight’s dismissal.
When Knight made the decision time
and time again to act in a totally
uncivilized and crazed manner, he
was only digging himself deeper and
deeper into a ditch that was finally
filled up. It was only a matter of time
before tolerance of Knight’s behavior

ran out.

Acts of physical or verbal abuse
have absolutely no place in sports.-
When it does occur, the underlying
principles of teamwork and sports-
manship are totally lost. A team then
concentrates solely on winning, dri-
ven by a twisted desire to endure any

circumstances for a chance at victory. V

It is extremely disheartening to see
that a group of college students value
winning more than playing for a
respectable coach.

Knight has expressed his desire to
continue coaching, and although I
would love to see Knight shunned by
the basketball world, I know it will
never happen.‘ Knight continuously
embarrassed himself, the university
and the entire sports world through
his antics and language, and it would
be a shame to see another school
employ this uncouth man.

While it may currentlybe a very
unpopular decision, Brand made a
highly respectable choice by turning
in Knight. It is the beginning of a
cleansing that will hopefully return
dignity and pride to the university and
the world of college basketball.

Pitt News, and today is her 19th birth-
day. You can e-mail her your thoughts

saying “if Coach Paterno, wants to
throw around some inaccurate
charges or to mislead the public, so
be it. We met our obligations to
them, and [we met them] on time.”

Harris said the general rule is to
exchange an equal number of game
tapes. Pitt has played two games
thus far, .while Penn State - has
played three, Pitt sent both of its
tapes to Penn State, while PSU sent
two of its three tapes to Harris and

_ his staff.

Since Pitt met those obligations,
Harris said he was puzzled by

‘ Paterno’s reasons for being upset.

“I just don’t understand,” Harris
said. ‘ . ’

The only thing, Harris said, that
he could think of as to why» Paterno
would be upset was because the

. teams did not exchangervsummer

tapes.

_ “What didn’t happen was the
summer exchange,’.’ Harris said.
The summer exchange Harris
referred to was the trading of tapes
in the summer of past games. But

4 Harris said that the Big East, Pitt’s
’ ‘conference, and the Big Ten, PSU’s

conference, do not trade those tapes
to teams out of the league.

“We chose not to exchange sum-
mer tapes,” Harris said.
' When Harris ’wasn’t defending

"Pitt’s video» trading agreements, he

spok_e of the actual football game.

‘As thousands of students waited

throughout the day in the lobby of
the William Pitt Union waiting to
buy tickets for the game_,the hyste-
ria and hype ‘began for the ‘final
match-up between these two bitter
in—state rivals.

But, across the river at the
UPMC Sports and Medicine
Complex Harris will have none of
that as he prepares his team for

‘ Saturday’s game.

“I don’t think we’ll have to
pump our guys up. I think we’ll
have to prepare them,” Harris said.
“We don’t have to do a Herculean
task because when you do that you
don’t do what your coached to do. If
you do what you’re coached to do
then you have a chance [to win].’,’

Harris’ comment aside, his team
is still pumped up for the event as
many players, especially his
seniors, like wide receiver Latef
Grim, know this is their last shot at
the Nittany Lions. I
c “I’m excited about what’s about

to happen on Saturday, not only—for
my‘ team, but definitely for the
city,” Grim said.

After two regular season games

the quarterback situation has
become even more murky for
Harris. Though Harris was

impressed with his quarterbacks’
abilities to step up their_play as the
game progressed at Bowling Green,
he won’t make his final decision
about a starter until Thursday.

Last_ week’s starter David

‘Priestley was l0-for-15.. -with 114

yards and a touchdown while his
counterpart John Turman was 12-
of-17 for 207 yards and three touch-
downs.

“My posture on it is I’m not

. necessarily going to go with the

productivity guy, I’m going to go

‘ with the guy that is executing our

system the best,” Harris said. “And
so far we don’t have one that is exe-
cuting the system the most consis-
tently.” »

The Nittany Lions’ defense has
struggled this season with the loss
of longtime defensive coordinator
Jerry Sandusky, and first-round
draft picks LaVar Arrington and
Courtney Brown. But their second-
round is still loaded. ‘

“They look awful good right

now, meaning they’re very fine ath-
1etes” Harris said. “[But] a lot of
times during the early part of our
preparation they all look like first-
round draft choices, regardless of
who you’re playing.” «

Though the Panthers are gaining
increasing national recognition for
their passing game, Harris believes
his running game is the lifeline to
the air attack.

However, highly-touted running
back Kevan Barlow and the stable
of talented backs behind him had
problems last weekend against
Bowling Green’s defense.

Pitt had a dismal 36 rushing
yards on 35 attempts while three
different running backs had fum-
bles. I

“The lack of productivity in the
running game is my responsibility,

it was difficult for us to endure,

because since -we’ve been here
we’ve not been a fumblin’, bum-
blin’ football team,” Harris said.

.“We’re not coachingloose carriage
of the football and we’re going to .

upgrade that drastically or we’ll
have some of the best conditioned
tailbacks in America.”

Saturday’s game is scheduled to
kick off at 3:30 p.m. and is ,a split
national telecast on CBS.

12th, respectively.

“I felt pretty good,” said Schmidt,
who ran the course in 19 minutes, 8
seconds, and took the advice of her
coach into account as she ran the
race.

“He told us to go out easier and
work as a team,” Schmidt said.

“It was a big—time personal best
[for Schmidt],” Freeman said. He
said she improved by her time by
over a minute.

Schmidt credited her experience
practicing on the hills of Schenley
Park for her performance on the
course. ‘

“We all know what to expect,”
Schmidt said.

McMillan, Mischa Bilyeu, and
freshman Dawn Hober were among
some of the other top performers for
the women. ' '

“The girls are getting better and
better,” Freeman said.

For the men, Mike Diano was the
first Panther to cross the finish line,
placing 15th with a time of 22:15.

, “I could’ve done way better,”
said Diano, who finished sixth last
week at West Virginia University’s
Hillbilly Shootout.

“Coming back was
uphill,” continued Diano.

“For the guys, the freshmen are
doing very well,” Freeman said.

Getting all of his runners to finish
within a minute of each other is what
Freeman is pushing his team to work
towards.

difficult

“If we do that,” said Freeman,
“we can be a very competitive team.”

Diano praised his fellow fresh-
men for their efforts in the park.

“Luke Dunlap, Clint Kotoby,
Ryan Smith, and Anthony Fulton all
did well. [They] all did better than
last week,” Diano said.

Comparing cross country season
to football season, Freeman felt his
Panthers were still in the preseason
phase preparing for a regular season
of big meets and a postseason of
1eague,.regional and national champi-
onships. ‘ ‘

The regular season could be said
to begin next week at Penn State with
some serious national competition.

“Four or five of the top teams in
the country will be there,” Freeman
said.

Gaudette had‘ just three saves
for the Red Storm, who dropped to

For their efforts in the win over
St. John’s and St. Francis on Sept.

by the Big East Conference.
Churchill was named Co—Defensive
Player of the Week, while Gaul’ was
