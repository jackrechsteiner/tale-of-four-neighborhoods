A Pitt student was struck by a car yester-
day afternoon as she crossed Bigelow
Boulevard on her bicycle.

Lisa Lytlestated in a police report that
she was riding on the sidewalk of Fifth
Avenue when she saw the “walk” light to
cross Bigelow Boulevard. As she crossed,
she was struck by Naruaki Terouchi, who
was turning left onto Bigelow Boulevard.

Terouchi told police at the scene that as

he was turning, he had to wait for two pedes-
trians to cross. After that, he continued and
struck Lytle. ‘ '
Lytle rolled over the hood of Terouchi’s
Geo Metro and shattered the front wind-
shield. Lytle was then taken to UPMC
Presbyterian. She has since been discharged.
City police may charge Terouchi in th
future. _ '

0 Today, at 5:15 p.m., Student Government
Board will meet for ﬁve minutes with only one
agenda item —— whether or not to reinstate the
recently suspended ' Constitutional Review

L. f Committee.

This decision came out of an informal meet-
ing last "night between SGB and CRC’s ‘former

. members.

While the vote will decide the fate of the
committee, the referendum that it had planned
will continue for next Wednesday. After dis-
cussing the events of Monday night’s meeting.
with their parliamentarian, an external specialist
on meeting procedure, President Joan Snyder
said that the referendum will continue because it
is being run by the Elections Committee.

The referendum, a student vote on whether
to change the time “of SGB elections, was mired
in controversy at the meeting Monday night

sea to vote on committee

when board members voted to suspend the .

actions of the CRC.

On Monday, board member John‘ Voinski
cited a lack of minutes from CRC’s meetings and
breakdown in communication between the board
and the CRC as the reasons for suspending the
committee.

Snyder stated the objective of last night’s ‘

meeting clearly.

“We’ve organized this so we can talk openly.

about last night’s actions, the past seven months
and what we want to move toward,” Snyder said.

The informal meeting followed an open for-
mat, not Robert’s Rules of Order. -—

“This isn’t about the referendum,” said
board member Mike Unangst. “This is about the
big picture. We don’t know what the next step
1s.’’ a . ‘

Unangst added that the referendum was con-
jured up in two meetings, which didn’t allow for
adequate research by the committee.

  Basketball

player jailed
. BRAD CUPRIK   a
Contributing Editor

V Pitt men’s basketball player Brandin Knight was arrested in
South Oakland early Friday morning after striking two parked cars
while driving, and then evading police for tl1ree—fourths of a mile,
according to an arrest report. . ‘

Knight was charged with two counts of leaving the scene of
an accident, two counts of failing to stop at a stop sign, one count
of ﬂeeing/evading and one count of reckless driving. .

He was taken into custody without incident and placed in th
Allegheny County Jail at 2:58 a.m. Friday. ’

He was arraigned, and bail was posted at $1,000 at 10 percent,
or $100, which was paid. Knight was released at 5:37 p.m. the
same day. ' ' A

The report did not mention whether there were signs ‘of alco-
hol or drug inﬂuence, but it did state that the road‘ surface was wet.

According to Pitt director of media relations E.J. Borghetti,
Knight declined to comment to the media The sophomore guard
will face charges in trafﬁc court on Friday morning.

The report states that during aroutine patrol, police spotted!

Knight’s black Chevrolet Tahoe striking the cars in front of 355

Atwood St. Knight then stopped beside the vehicles for a few sec- .

onds before pulling away. - V
The arresting oﬂicer then activated the police car’s lights and
sirens, attempting to stop Knight;

Knight continued west on Atwood Street and turned left onto .

Louisa Street, driving through the stop sign. The officer continued

to pursue Knight as he traveled south on Louisa. He then drove A

through another stop sign, heading west on Semple Street toward

Forbes Avenue, before being blocked by a parked vehicle, accord- ‘

ing to ﬂre report. -

The two cars were owned by Shea Rosen and George Ge1io,_ V

who were unavailable for comment. Michele Rosen and Brian

‘ Gerio, Pitt students who live in the residences of the cars’ owners,

reside on Atwood Street. They could not be reached for comment.

The police also had problems locating Rosen or Gerio and
said that a supplemental report will be ﬁled at a later date.

Rosen’~s car, a 1997 black Nissan Maxima, had damage to the
driver side door and mirror, according to the report. Gerio’s 1989
burgundy Chevrolet Celebrity had damage to the driver’s side rear.

The report also stated that Knight’s car had damage to the
front bumper, fender and door, as well as paint transfer from the
collisions.

The basketball team begins the season with its “Midnight
Madness” practice Friday night, a matter of hours after Knight’s
scheduled court appearance. . _

In the 1999-2000 season, Knight started 25 of the team’s 28
games and played in all of them, averaging 8.5 points per game.

His arrest is the latest of a recent suing of problems for the
men’s basketball team. - 9

ward Donatas Zavackas was suspended for three games for his
involvement in the misuse of a University phone access code, for-
ward Isaac Hawkins was arrested for possession of marijuana and
guard Kellii Taylor was dismissed from the team for failing a drug
test. ’ ’ e

Pitt Police crack  

down on Bouquet

LAUREN NAVALKOWS KY
Staff Writer

At about 8:30 p.m. Monday,
junior Abby Ritter heard a, knock on
the door of her Bouquet Gardens

apartment. To her surprise, she"

opened the door to find two Pitt
police officers.

“I was sitting in my apartment
and heard a loud banging on my
door,” Ritter said.

Officers informed Ritter of the
multiple exterior doors that were
unlocked around the Bouquet
Gardens complex and told her to be
more careful in the future.

Ritter said she felt as if the
police were implying that she was
responsible for the unlocked doors.

“I know people often prop open
a door if they’re smoking a ciga-
rette, but I’ve never done anything,”
she said. _ V

Ritter was told by police that
their visit was in response to the
colder weather.

“They said now that it is getting
cold outside, homeless will look for
shelter and may come here,” she
said.

Ritter was not the only Bouquet
Gardens resident who received a
Pitt police visit Monday evening.
Officers went door to door in the
complex informing students of the
numerous unlocked exterior doors.

Junior Mike Byrnes, who also
lives in building‘ G of [Bouquet
Gardens, said police gave him dif-
ferent reasons for their visit.

A “The police knocked on my door
and told me about pennies that had

been lodged in doors,” Byrnes said.
“They also said something about
someone in another building whose
laptop was stolen and told me to
keep my doors locked.”

Byrnes was never informed of a
risk of homeless people looking for
shelter in the apartments, and Ritter
was never told of pennies being
lodged in doors or of the stolen lap-

‘top.

Aside from the one Bouquet
Gardens resident who reported the
stolen laptop,~Pitt police said there
have not been an unusual number of
thefts or problems in the complex
this year. ;

Deborah Furka, chief of the Pitt -

police, believes officers surveyed
the grounds Monday night for pre-
cautionary measures.

“There hasn’t been a rash in
crime at Bouquet Gardens,” Furka
said. “If an officer‘ find-s a door
unlocked inany dorm, they’1l report
it to the students. It does not matter
if an officer is in Bouquet Gardens,
Lothrop or any other residence
hall.”

University spokesman Ken
Service agreed with ‘Furka, saying
the officers’ intent was to prevent
any future crime.

“Police had noticed that 14

doors were propped open and they
went around requesting that stu-

dents lock their doors,” Service.

said. “I know they do it for conve-
nience’s sake, but it’s not safe.” _A
Despite police efforts to prevent

inon—residents from entering the

building, this reporter had no prob-
lem entering a Bouquet Gardens
building to interview residents.

‘Pittfalls’ production

THEPIITNEWS

gives advice in song

TAMARA SIMPSON

The Pitt News

“Free T-shirts, cell phones and gym
bags for signing on the line!”

With this statement, the “Pittfalls” cast’
caught the attention of its freshmen audi-
ence as it began an informative program
about issues college students face on a daily

basis. ‘

- The program, performed by the theater

H arts ‘department,’ was mandatory for all

freshmen studiesastudents.
Besides criticizing credit card, applica-

tions, the cast introduced students to numer-
ous “perils of Pitt,” including‘ unprotected '
sex, lack of studying, drugs and alcohol.
‘ After welcoming the students to Pitt, per-

formers sang, “Everyone was brought here —
by fate, and if all goes well, you’ll gradu-
ate!” 0 - , A ,

Students were humorously warned to

look both left and right before crossing Fifth
Avenue. The cast pointed out that although 1

it appears to be . a 'one—way street, buses
sometimes seem to come out of nowhere.

. The perfomiance then turned to the ele-
vators at Pitt. The cast members joked about

‘ the horrors of elevator travel, including a

ride to the top of the Cathedral with a stu— *

dent who doesn’t bathe.

Keeping with the foulodor theme, the

‘ performance highlighted the joys of learn-

ing how to do laundry. The cast urged male
students to ask their female acquaintances
for assistance, suggesting thepossibility of
getting a_date out of the deal. 1 6
“Some will fall in’ love; some study

  At te end of  
yourrope 1,  
w1th.Dl-ETS?’    

This time... A  

hard and make the dean’s list; some will try
drugs for the ﬁrst time,” they sang.

. Roommate problems were the .next ~

topic covered in the presentation. Situations
mentioned included times when a room-
mate doesn’t have money for rent, borrows
things without asking, or talks endlessly on

the phone without noticing that someone _

else would like to make a call} '

. “Don’t kill your roommate!” the cast f ,

advised in song. 8, . 

The “Pittfalls” cast encouraged .stu—
dents to use condoms to protect themselves
from sexually transmitted diseases.
Freshmen were informed that if they are
worried about an “accident” with a condom,
they should call Student Health Services to
be tested. Eating disorders, drinking and dri-
ving, and depression were also touched
upon during the performance. 1

Turning to rape, the performers point-

ing out that a woman has a better chance of . '

being raped while consuming alcohol than
she does soberly walking down a_ dark alley
at night alone. The cast pointed to a grim

1 statistic: One in every eight women will be -

raped during their lifetime.

Although the performance was manda-
tory for freshmen studies classes, students
were generally impressed with the show.

“It covered issues that needed to be
covered, but it would have been more help-
ful at the beginning of the year because I

have already experienced one of the whole V

ideals,” said Alexis Brown.

The show will be performed in the
Stephen Foster Memorial auditorium today
and Thursday at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and  p.m.

‘The ﬁnal show will be Friday at 10 a.m.

Student leaders stress
unity and traditions

DAVE HARTMAN

Assistant News Editor

A group of 14 student leaders
met with Vice Provost for Academic

Affairs Jack Daniel yesterday to

discuss ways‘ in which Pitt can
encourage unity and tradition with-
in the student body. '

The two—hour luncheon focused .

on what Daniel ~ called A the
Balkanization of the many student
groups on campus». He credited the
students and University with offer-
ing'a wideselection of special
interest clubs, but stressed the
importance of holding campus-uni-

fying events that would appeal to_

the ‘entire student body.

_Daniel said it’s very easy for
members of one organization to not
care about another organization, or
even to work against another orga-
nization, but doing so is never in
students’ best interests. .

“When you have enhanced stu-
dent interaction, you have enhanced
learning,” he said. ‘

Danielthen opened the discus-

sion to the student leaders, asking‘

them to share‘ their views on the
problem. Representatives‘ from the
Black Action Society,
Alliance, Resident . . Student
Association, Student Government
Board and other campus organiza-
tions exchanged ideas in the round-
table discussion that followed.
“The thing I have in common

with all of you is that we all go to —

the same school,” ' said SGB
President Joan Snyder; who serves

as vice chair of the committee.

“Now how do you build that com-
monality to be stronger?”

The leaders discussed ways of
encouraging" students to become
involved with various on-campus
organizations. Lisa Bass, the multi-

cultural council chair of the SGB, '
said she thought that freshmen were '

bombarded with solicitations to
join various organizations. Bass
said that when she was a freshman,
she was too overwhelmed to con-

“There are 18 people from various
backgrounds in «the committee,” said
board member Diran Adekanye, who
chaired the CRC. “We have representa-
tion. We have ' also gone to other
schools.” _ I ‘

Other members of the defunct com-
mittee said that they had talked to other
universities, such as Wisconsin and

“We did informal questioning over
the summer,” said Jay Dworin, who
served on the CRC. “Through quite a
bit of debate, we decided this is the
most logical way to put it forth.” _

“A lot of stuff happened last sum-

 mer, and we didn’t know exactly where
we were going. But the first step is‘ the

referendum,” said Jeff Weber, who also
served on the CRC. . , A
The ﬂashbacks were cut off by

A board member Jo’ie Taylor.

“The referendum is under the

will run the referendum and the promo-
tions for it. We need to ﬁgure out now
how to help them get the information
out,” Taylor said. “It’s gonna happen.”

ber of the Governmental Relations
Committee. “Let’s get moving here.”

Exchanges continued between the
former committee members and board
members who had voted for the suspen-
sion.

“I wish that the committee would‘

have come to us in April,” said board
member Dave Lander. “This - way‘ we
could have made the bylaw changes
early on and so SGB could plan for the
change.” I I

Taylor repeated that the referendum
will take place and that students need to
be informed. ,

“But how can we reinstate the com-
mittee when they haven’t followed the
bylaws in the past?” Unangst said.

“You’ve had since April to put it out
to the students,” said board member
Jonathan Hoffman. V

. “If it’s just a question of minutes,
then there’s no need to argue the bylaws

again. You all saw them and voted on

them,” Dworin said. “[The students
aren’t] being informed because we’re
always in here arguing.”

In one of the few light moments of
the meeting, Weber gave Scout’s Honor
that the committee would keep minutes

~ in the future.

- “I do "believe . there are personal

agendas,” Weber said. “We’re trying to

keep the board out of the process. Each
board is ‘a puppet of the administration
and this is what we’re trying to change.”

Since the CRC can not conduct any

official actions, the ‘weight of future ’

information sessions about the referen-
dum will fall on the -Elections
Committee.

Snyder ' then took control of ‘the

meeting and decided on a time for a‘

board meeting today. After arguing over

a late evening meeting, 5:15 p.m. was

ﬁnally set.
‘‘It’ll take ﬁve‘ minutes provided

you don’t get confused about Robert’s

Rules of Order,” said judicial chair
Amber Boyd.

After the board meeting, there will
be a forumat 7:30 p.m. in IP56 Posvar
Hall to inform students about the refer-
endum.

Former CRC and board members
will be present to answer student ques-
tions. Another forum will be held next
Monday to debate the referendum.

“It’d be more professional to rein-
state, the committee,” Snyder said.

“They’ve worked so hard and the

‘ board can work with them to make SGB

better.” '

“I think there’s a lack of target-
ing older students,” she said.

The discussion moved to events
that the Universit‘y could sponsor in
order to increase the Pitt’s student
unity and pride. '

Students contemplated the fea-S

sibility of holding concerts, possi-
bly in conjunction with other col-
leges, ‘either on campus or
Downtown. ,

Snyder emphasized the impor-
tance of developing traditions at

- Pitt, something that many attendees

agreed is the
University.

The group collectively decided

to hold ' a student forum in
November during which representa-

tives from all student_ organizations, ,

as well as individual students, will
be able to voice their opinions on

ways" in which the University can

unify its student body.

In preparation for the forum, the ’

committee decided a multimedia
marketing plan would be put. into

effect, involving possible advertis—.

ing mediums ranging from ﬂiers
and mailings to messages writte
with sidewalk chalk. ‘
“If wereally care about reach-
ing all the students,” Snyder said,
“we need to advertise off campus,

and places where everyone will see

it.” '

No final plans were made at the"

meeting, in part because the group

wants to involve as many students
as possible in the decision. Before
dismissing the meeting, Daniel con-

gratulated the members on the

progress they had made toward

After some students expressed I

For most people, crossing the
street is not an activity that requires
upper-level ‘cognitive ability. Your
mind is usually on something else, like
how you didn’t study enough for the
test in the class that you’re headed‘
toward. VV1th little regard to your sur-
roundings, you cross the street without
thinking twice. I

It might be time to devote a little
more mental energy to this seemingly
simple task, whether you are on foot or
riding a bicycle. Yesterday, Pitt student
LisaLytlewashitbyacarasshe
crossed Bigelow Boulevard at Fifth
Avenue on a bicycle. To avoid‘ acci-
dents like this in the future, students

' should make a concerted effort toward

being more aware with regard to street
crossing, practically an art in an area

'  such as Oakland.

Common sense goes a long way.
In Pittsburgh one must be particularly

 of the buses. When crossing Fifth _
7' “Avenue it can be tempting to step into

the bus lanes in order to assess how
much distance there is between you

 T and oncoming trafﬁc,butthis can prove

to be dangerous, especially with the
scaﬁolding by the Towers restricting
vision. Buses are large and may have
trouble braking in time to refrain from
-smacking you oﬂ’ your toes. Be patient

a and wait for the light to change; being a

pedestrians

price to pay for guaranteed safety.
Crossing Fifth at places other than
the comers is for masochistic daredev-

ils only. After you’ve built up momen- ,

tum dashing between traffic, you’ll
sprint smack into the metal railings that
run on the Cathedral side. Not only do
you run the risk of getting hurt, you’ll
also look very foolish.

Bicyclists need to be extra careful.
As a cyclist you essentially fol1ow.the
same rules as cars, but you don’t have
the security of being enclosed in a few
thousand pounds of metal. So be alert,
stay otf of ﬂie sidewalks, don’t attempt
to weave around cars and always wear
a helmet

Since Fifth and Bigelow are such
hot spots for pedestrian accidents, we
could beneﬁt greatly from the construc-
tion of turmels or underpasses at these
locations. Speciﬁcally, Bigelow is in
need of such a contraption at the spot ‘

where the crosswalk is curr‘ently‘locat-

ed; ‘Fifth could use oriefat intersec- ’

tion with Thackeray. Tunnels especial- ‘

ly would be safe, effective and toasty
warm in ﬂre winter. But until the
University is willing to take us up on
these more permanent solutions, it’s up
to students to «revert to what they
leamed as 5-year-olds — don’t play in
traffic, wait for your turn to cross,
watch out for big heavy things like
buses and always look both ways.

Ah, the joys of Homecoming weekend:
The football game where the home team
trounces the opponent, the crowning of the king
and queen, the reuniting with old friends.
Sounds familiar, right? After all,
Pitt did.that several weeks ago.

However, I’m talking about a -
different kind of Homecoming: the
one at my high school. The last .

Selinsgrove, Pa. — that little town I used to,
and on occasion still do, call home —-i for the
ﬁrst time in a month. It’s amazing what can
happen in that short of a time —— I hardly rec-
ognized the place!

Take my high school’s football program,
for example. Until a couple of years ago, “foot-
ball” would have been a questionable word to
include in that phrase. Now the team is actually
rather good —- it beat Danville, who always
used to give us trouble, and defeated our main

rival Shikellamy to the tune of 60-something to 4

near nothing. As for the homecoming game
against Miﬂlinburg: 54-0!

r Why didn’t they play this well when I went
there? Is it a conspiracy? Were they just waiting
for me to leave so they could armoy ‘me by actu-
ally playing well? Additionally, Howard L.

Bolig Memorial Stadium (yes, Selinsgrove has _ '
a stadium» with a biggername than the town.

itself) has a brandnew public address system
you can actually hear. Now even the referee
has a microphone so that you lmow what
botched call he made. When I saw the new
scoreboard, I began to wonder about a few

. I wondered where did the money for these '
' things come from? Did it magically appear out

of nowhere upon the class of 2000’s gradua-
tion? Did the school and the state make some
sort of deal that, once the school got rid of the
ﬁrst (or last) class of the millennium, gazillions

r of -dollars would just appear out ‘of thin air? I

want to know whose idea this was and why I
wasn’t let in on it. w _ 3'.’
OK,» so the school has changed. Ihoped

  ‘ that atleast Weis Supermarket, where I used to
work, would bring me some familiarity. But I,

 

was wrong: When I visited, I recognized only a
few of the people with whom I used to work!
Maybe I have lousy -timing and showed up

.when everyone I know wasn’t working, but

even the people I did recognize
didn’t recognize me! Just because I
actually shaved off the goatee
doesn’t mean my appearance
changed that drastically.

and no one at work recognized me. What about
the town itself? Everything’s changing there,
too. A lot of property has been sold, and new
buildings are being built. The local mall doesn’t
even have a movie theater anymore, as it’s
going to be replaced by a multiplex of some
sort. Where was this a couple of years ago? Of
course, they had to wait until I left. Once again,
I start screaming about a conspiracy. No one lis-
tens to me when I’m screaming about conspir-
acies + they just think I’m nuts. But I know
what I’m talking about! I’ve already said how
much Selins grove has gotten in the month since
I left, so if that isn’t proof then what is?

At least things at church should be the
same, right? It’s a church —-- there should at
least be some sense of normalcy, right? But no,
the Sunday school class to which I used to go
with regularity wasn’t meeting that day because
of the teacher’s absence, so I ended up in anoth-
er one talking about how to keep marriages
from ending in divorce. That was way out of
my league because I’m not married, nor do I
even have a steady girlfriend.

’ ~ So if you decide to go home some week-

. end, be ready for change, the only constant in

life. Had I been expecting it, I would have
enjoyed myself more; instead, I kept wondering

what happened to the place.

Oh well, there’s always Thanksgiving‘
break. Who knows what it’s going to be like
then?

In a game of missed opportuni-
ties and a record number of corner
kicks, the No. 7 ranked Pitt men’s
soccer team defeated local rival
Robert Morris College 2-1 yesterday
at the North Athletic Complex.

“We didn’t make good decisions.
We worked hard, but we played
dumb,” said Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher.’

Pitt had many opportunities to
score but couldn’t capitalize. The
Panthers had 22 shots, but only six
of those shots were on goal. Pitt also
had 16 corner kicks and failed to
score on any of them. ;

The 16 corner kicks marked a
new single game record for Pitt,
breaking the old record of 12. The
last time that 12 corner kicks
occurred was against Gannon on
Nov. 3, 1973.

Freshman defender Clay Haflick
scored the lone goal of the first half
at the 24-minute mark. He kicked in
the rebound from midfielder Bryan
Hopper’s shot.

In the second half Pitt took a

. defenders. Colonial Sean Arnold
scored on a cross—field pass from
Eugene Mazzuca. The pass slipped
under Pitt goalkeeper Justin Gaul,
and Arnold had an easy open—net
shot.

“Instead of closing the game
down, we got scattered and they got
back in it,” Luxbacher said. “The
best thing to say here is that we go,t
a win.” _ . ’

Pitt held on for the last three
minutes of the game to preserve its
2-1 win and an 11-1 overall record.
Pitt now heads into Boston College
Saturday to continue its Big East
schedule. ’

The game with Robert Morris
was a non-conference game, follow-
ing seven straight conference match-
es. This might have been the reason
for some of Pitt’s mental break-
downs in yesterday’s game.

commanding 2-0 lead in the 83rd
minute on a goal by defenseman
Chris Churchill. He scoredon a
penalty shot that was awarded to Pitt
for being tripped in the goal area.
The two goals scored for Pitt

were by defensemen, not forwards.
“We don’t play in three different
units here,” Churchill said. “We are
all one team here. Whoever gets the
goals gets the goals.”

“Sometimes you get a non-con-

games,” Luxbacher said. —“Even

though they are a good team, that

Tennis strings together victory over Bloomsburg

Fulton of Bloomsburg yesterday in singles play.

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

After losing to Duquesne twice last sea-
son, Pitt’s women’s tennis team bounced back
to shut out the Dukes last week.

In a repeat of that performance, the.

Panthers avenged four straight losses to
Bloomsburg with a 5-3 win yesterday at the
Greentree Racquet Club.

“We played very competitive tennis and
came out with a victory,” Pitt head coach
George Dieffenbach said of the team’s first-
ever win against Bloomsburg.

The singles competition was highlighted

by a marathon match between Pitt’s Nikki,

Borza and Erin Bartsch of Bloomsburg. The
two No. 1 players dueled for three and a half
hours before Bartsch pulled out a 6-4, 6-7
(5), 6-4 victory.

“That was a tremendous match,”
Dieffenbach said. “They were having eight,
nine, l0-shot rallies.”

The two players might have been on the
court for more than three hours, but the com-

petition didn’t suffer, according to
Dieffenbach. '

“That’s a long time to be out there sus-
taining that intensity,” he said. “But they did
it. They were still crushingthe ball in the
third set.” i 9 . .

At No. 2 singles, Pitt freshman Jill
Williams faced Beth’Fulton, who transferred
to Bloomsburg from Virginia Tech, where she
was the Hokies’ No. 3 player.

Fulton’s experience did not affect
Williams, though, as she defeated Fulton by
the score of 6-3, 6-2. ’

“Jill put forth an outstanding effort,”
Dieffenbach said. “She has a lot of intensity,
and she’s not the type of player that you want
to have to play against.” _ .

After losing to Bloomsburg-’s Heather
Miller, 6-2, 6-3, I in 1999, ,Pitt’s Lindsay
Carlson had her work cut out for her in the
rematch yesterday. But Carlson used consis-
tent play and avoided errors in her 6-3, 6-4

Numbers and stats maylead to more wins

In the last 20 years, baseball
analysis has seen an increasing
usage of sabermetrics, the applica-
tion of statistics to the American
pastime.

This change has even begun to
lead to different administration of
certain teams —- several have hired
sabermetrics experts as consultants
and advisers, and one general man-
ager, Billy Beane of Oakland, has
been a strong advocate of the saber-
metric approach to the game.

Do the stat geeks have it right?
Or do they overlook elements that
cannot be quantified? '

faith in youthalso is present in
,many “stat—heads”). '

In l999,‘they upped their record
to 87-75, with 21-year-old Eric
Chavez and 23-year-old .Tim

Hudson joining the mix, plus stat-

head favorites like Tony Phillips,
John J aha and Randy Velarde.

Now in 2000, they continued the
path upwards by winning the

.American League West before bow-

ing out in the Division Series to the
New York Yankeesin five games.

Obviously, they have been win-
ning a lot more using the stat-head
approach. Walk-happy players like
Jaha, Velarde, Jason Giambi and
Matt Stairs have helped the team’s
productivity. ' -

A guy like Stairs or Jeremy
Giambi, who combines lots of
walks and homers with alow aver-
age, can be valuable, even if other
teams fail to recognize the fact.

‘ Hudson has been excellent at times,

perhaps indicating that pitch counts
work — and perhaps indicating that
he’s just a good pitcher. J,
On the. other. hand_, Oakland has
been far from dominant. .
The Chicago White Sox hada

’ better record despite low-OPS types

like Chris Singleton
Johnson. a ,

ure this season by stat—heads,

remained atop their division, no’
vmatter how much they were derided
for having players who were too,

old. And the Astros, the stat geek-

. supported team in the National '

League, sucked, to put things suc-
cinctly. ‘ — ' . V

The sabermetric approach does
seem to work in many ways, but it
has its ﬂaws. , '

Most noticeably, it overlooks
elements like hustle and heart, char-
acteristics that made mediocre play-

l_ers like Mookie ‘Wilson and Wally
Backman into guys you would want’

to have on a team. -

The 1960 Pirates got by on guts,
not with overwhelming ability. The
best team on paper doesn’t always
win. ‘ A

The game, after all, is played on
grass or artificial turf, not paper.

The approachofa Rob ‘Neyer seems.

to be, “Well, I can’t see it or quan-
tify it, so itmustn’t exist.”
No wonder_ all-out players like

Jason Kendall (a stat geeklfavorite) _

are critical of “little Rotisserie
League geeks.” Kendallsaid, “They

don’t have the slightest idea how to '

play the game except on a comput-

. er, and it makes me sick.”

Also, the sabermetricians are

Pitt might also have
below expectations because of the
pressure of being the No. 7 team in
the country. The Panthers began the
season unranked, then moved up to
18th when they defeated No. 3 St.
John’s. Now with the No. 7 rank-
ing, the pressure is mounting.

“It really doesn’t mean any-
thing,” Churchill said. “We still
have to come out here and win all
these games. If we happen to come

out this win, then we are right back
to where we started.” a

in here [Robert Morris] and not pull.

The third reason for a lackluster
game was the field conditions.
Because of the rain the Pittsburgh
area is getting, the field yesterday

‘was soaking wet. - -

Players slid back and forth as

they tried to pivot in the slick turf.

Even the lone goal by Robert
Morris seemed to be affected by the
slick turf. The ball slid between the
wet hands of Gaul and"went right to
Arnold. .

Even with these explanations,
Luxbacher and the team still aren’t

‘satisfied with how they played.

“We gave them chances. We
weren’t mentally‘ ready for the
game,” Luxbacher said. “We are
going to have to elevate our game
300 percent for this weekend
[against Boston College].”

. surprisingly blind to statistics that

don’t correlate with their precon-
ceived notions., ‘ ‘ —
it There is no evidence that high
pitch counts affect those over age
-25, yet they still scream and holler
when a guy like Pirates pitcher Kris
Benson tops 100 pitches. ‘
For people relying upon math,

the usage of a round “magical”"

number like 100 is rather silly,

when this number is not supported

by any research.

Similarly, the revelation that '
~ walks

are underrated leads to
SDCNS (stat-drunk computer
nerds) to overrate guys like Rob

Deer who hadlow averages but.
walked a lot, and underrate high»

contact, low-walk players like
Kirby Puckett. ' ‘
They don’t seem to realize that
Shawon Dunston was a good player
inhis prime, despite drawing a
walk once in a blue moon. ‘
In their ,_ p'ro—youthp frenzy,
SDCNS back minor-leaguers with
mediocre track records (see Emil
Brown, Adam Hyzdu and Lou
Collier for local examples) over
_proven . major—1eaguers‘ like Ed
Sprague and John Vander’Wal.
For all their talk of impartiality,
stats people are just as much into

i the mindless promotion of a given

player as any other fan (not that
this is bad). ‘

Ignoring stats can limit the
methods used to put a winning team

‘ . on the field.

Mischa Gelman is a columnist for
The Pitt News and likes to play with
numbers and likes to play baseball
(though he’s much better at the for-
mer). He just doesn’t think it’s right
to worship one without looking at
the other.

year,” Dieffenbach said -of Carlson.
“She didn’t make any unforced
errors. When you’re aggressive and
consistent, that’s hard to beat.”
Needing a sweep of her singles
and doubles matches to reach the
l00—victory mark for her career,
Pitt’s No. 4 player Dana Jafarian

_ began her quest with a 6-2, 5-7, 6-1

win over Katie Kochera.

Brooke Yablonski, a sophomore
who plays No. 5 for Pitt, once again
showed an ability to close out
matches that was not present last
season, as she defeated Miranda
Campbell, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2. _

Yablonski’.s freshman campaign

was marred by injury, and she was .

not able to record a singles win, los-
ing in the third set on more than one
occasion.

But Dieffenbach said that a cou-

ple of wins early this season have

proved that she is on the right track.

“Brooke battled back in that
match,” Dieffenbach said. “She was
definitely not on her game in the
first set. But she has a lot of,confi-
dence this year. That’s the main dif-
ference [between 1999eand 2000].
Her serve and her return of serve
were great in the match.”

The final singles match saw Pitt
freshman Hayley Hughes drop a 7-

'5, 6-3 decision to Bloomsburg’s

Jenn Esposito. ‘

Pitt was up 4-2 heading into the
doubles portion of the match, mean-
ing that it needed just one win out

of the three doubles matches.

The win did not come at No. 1
doubles, , where Williams and
Carlson were defeated by Bartsch
and Fulton, 8-1. _

“They just played a good team,”
Dieffenbach said of the loss.

But at No. 2 doubles, Yablonski  
i said, noting that Bloomsburg had a

and Hughes captured an 8-3 victory
over Miller and Kochera to clinch
the match for the Panthers.

“It’s a big win for those two,”
Dieffenbach said. ‘‘They’re having
a really good season and are a good
team because they compliment each
other well.’’ - ‘

The victory meant the. match

was finally decided’ at about 8:30

p.m., after" starting at 3. p.m.

Whether it be bratwurst in Green
Bay, Wis., cheesesteaks in Philadelphia
or kielbasa here in Pittsburgh, there are
things to know if you want to tailgate
right.

' The best thing to do is to plan the
tailgating three or four days in
advance. This way, any V possible
changes or problems that arise can be
handled easily. 0

. If you’re a rookie at tailgating, it is
best to go with the most popular items:
bratwurst, sandwiches, hamburgers,
chicken, hot dogs and, of course, kiel-
basa. E _ _ A

Only true veterans can think about

including such items as lobster, Coney.

Island hot dogs, buffalo wings or crabs
on the tailgating menu. The veterans
have been doing these typescof things
for years, delighting friends and fellow
tailgaters with some delicious recipes.
Also included should be some kind
of vegetable. A veggie tray with some
ranch dip in the middle is a great snack

food until the main course is ready.-

Chips, pretzels and a cheese plate also
work for snacking and can accompany
the meal. 9 ’

THE Prrr NEWS DINING GUHDE

Plan ahead for perfect tailgaitin

Condiments are also important.
Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish,

onions, lettuce, tomatoes and steak

sauce are all essentials.

The produce and meat should be
bought the day before the tailgating
party, and freshness is the key to cus-
tomer satisfaction.

Slipping the raw meats into a plas-
tic, resealable bag will prevent the
bloodfrom leaking and creating a safe-
ty hazard. Make sure that plenty of
plastic utensils and cups are also
packed away, along with servingfalates

, and more than one garbage bag.

The food preparation can be started
the day before as well. If you are mar-
inating the pork, beef and chicken, that

can be done the day before, as can :9

chopping the vegetables.

The morning of the game, pack up
your car with tables, chairs, soap,
water and towels. Bring two coolers +.
one for drinks and one for the meat.

A common misconception about
tailgating is that bags of ice are needed
for the coolers, but'here’s an alterna-
tive solution to the cooling problem.
Fill three or four empty plastic milk
containers with water and freezethem.
Put them in the cooler during the party,
and bythe end of the game, you’ll have
some cool, clean drinking water. Plus,

 

your cooler will not be ﬂooded.
Tailgating parties should start three

to four hours before the game, and the

cooking should start an hour and a half

rbeforekickoff, tip—off or the first pitch.

Here’s a Mississippi recipe from
www.tailgating.corn for “drunk chick-
en”:

First, take a whole chicken and
wash thoroughly. Rub your‘ favorite
spices on the chicken, and put it aside.

PITT NEWS FILE Pno

Then, light up your grill, and open a
can of beer. Take the full, opened can
and place it on the grill.

Next, take the chicken and place
the beer up the bird’s cavity. As the
chicken is grilled, the the chicken
absorbs the beer to make a tasty meal.

So cook extra, share with your
neighbors, and swap recipes.
Tailgating is fun, but remember, it’s an
art.

PATRICK ROBERTSON

The Pitt News

Pitt is rapidly approaching the
middle of the semester, and some stu-
dents are rapidly approaching finan-
cial disaster. .

All of that money they came to
school with has been spent on clothes",
partying, books or emergency road
trips. _ » ' '

Now, some of them are scrounging
for a cheap way to eat each night. They
may mooch blocks from a friend or try
to join the vagrants on Forbes Avenue
in order to find a nightly meal, but that
doesn’t have to be the case. There are
plenty of ways to jump—start students
in the kitchen. » A A

The first step, and the most impor-
tant, is to head to the grocery store.
The choices are limited for those with-
out‘ access to a car. A bus will get stu-
dents to Giant Eagle on Centre Avenue
or in Squirrel Hill. _

If the big bird isn’t what you’re
looking for, grab a bus to the Food
Gallery on Centre Avenue or to the
North Hills for a choice of Shop ‘n’
Save or Foodland.

When at the store, shop smart. Go S’

for as much Food Club or, off-brand
food as possible. Specials come in

really handy and can produce some
expensive items at cheap" prices.
Before you go to the store, sit down
and plan the menu for the week to be
sure you buy just what you need.

i Also, before heading for the store,
sit down with the Sunday paper. The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette costs $1.50,

* but it can save you much more than

that. ,
Don’t let coupons dictate ,what

‘ you buy, but dollet them make sugges-

tions. If you have two sticks of butter
left but butter is on sale, go ahead and
buy some. You?-ll need it eventually.

‘ Finally, before you go to thestore,

'. eat something. This will make you less

likely tolbuy everything you ‘see.

‘ ‘When at the store, think about
what kind of food you buy. Lookat the
difference between fresh, ‘frozen or
canned peas. Look at the price, and
consider when you will be able to use
the peas. ' A‘ . . A

If you’re looking. for meat for a
dish, it isn’t necessary to buy the most

, expensive cut you can find. You’re just

going to cook it anyway. V ,

Grocery stores set up displays and
samples to try. to convince you to buy
more than you need. Often, they suc-
ceed. Take a look at only what you
need. Do not get sucked .in.

First of all, don’t forget your
friend the crockpot. What, a crockpot?
Isn’t that just for old ladies? A

Absolutely not. The crockpot is

cerned. You can put food in it in the '
. morning, and it will be ready whenev_—

er you come home. _

One of the best crockpot meals is a
roast. Beef, pork, veal or lamb, it
doesn’t matter. If you cook a roast, you

' can use the leftovers in stew, for gravy,

or a for wholelot of other things.
Staple foods are ‘easy , to, “cook.

hot dogs, any kind of sandwich, and

anything you can do with chicken are .

“Wemust eat to live and live to eat.”
—Hemy Fielding ‘

Millennial culture is further‘ removed
from basic humanity than any other culture
before it. That’s why we have these human-
instinct movies, such as “Fight Club,” com-
ing out and why some of us feel compelled
to criticize articles aboutpeople who risk
their lives to create a false sense of adven-
ture. I’m not pointing ﬁngers or naming

. names; I’m just sayin’.

Think about prehistoric man (and
woman) and what the point of his existence
was —— besides, of course, sex. It was sur-
vival, and that means food. Man lived to eat
to stay alive and make babies. Now, man
lives to work or study through the aid of
machinery to make money. We’ve been out
of "touch with food for quite a while. This
column is trying to change that .

There’s a lot to be said for eating cheap,
especially in college, where the living is

generally cheap. But is there a lot to be said
for Oodles of Noodles and macaroni and

cheese, outside of “’Ihey’re bad and bad for
you”? Not only that, but all these foods do is
perpetuate college-kid stereotypes 'we
can stand to eschew. » ‘

We need to collectively reclaim what

0 our prehistoric ancestors fought hard to

make an integral part of our daily lives. We
need a new philosophy toward food." We
need to start weeding out the exquisitely
good from the deceptively  For those of
you forced by location or other circurn-
stances into complete dependence on Pit1’s

dining halls, my revolutionary heart says, -

“Good luck.” For the rest of you in the vicin-

A ity of a grocery store, this is for you.

Let’s just take breakfast forexample.
We all have fond memories of sugary cere-
als—andthankGodPitthaspanderedto
this with Lucky Charms available in some
of its cafeterias — but this is really the last
thing we should be eating so early the
morning. Sugar gets you all geeked up and
then makes" you crash, and no matter what
the side of the box tells you, Lucky Charms
isn’t the energy-boosting way to get your
day started. . . . -
‘ Bran-oriented cereals that advertise
nothing but the best in health don’t usually

. tell. you that you sacriﬁce taste for that

health, and nowhere in this column will"I te_ll-
you to ever sacriﬁce taste, ever. _ _

_ So throw away the Total and head for
ﬁrings with the names of the ingredients
right there on the front of the box, Cranberry
Almond Cnmch for example. And I know
you’re thinking about money, but you prob-

ably should stop. Yes, these are usually the ,

more expensive cereals, but does it matter?

~ Do you really want to place a price tag on

your health and well—being, as well as your
enjoyment of a vital part of existence?

Let’s see something here really quick
Umrn, Bill, what do you spend the majority
of your money on? — T

“Uhh, probably beer and parties.”
Right, OK. Sally, how ‘bout you? -
“Well, I go to the mall a lot Ilike to buy

‘ shoes. _Oh, and ‘O’ pizza after a party.”

All righty, then. Quick, you two, how
many different types of vegetables in your

fridges? ‘

‘Uhh ...” .
‘.‘Does vodka count?” , .
You see? When did food become such
a low priority for us? Why do we try to ﬁt

V foodinto our schedules and budgets instead

of making time and money for its consump-

. tion and enjoyment? Doesn’t this bother

anyone else but me?
I’m not suggesting that we throw away

_. all time and money spent on fun and enj oy-
able things, such as shopping» or bar- going or

partying. I’m trying to suggest .a medium
between the two. Here are some things I’ve
come up with to get good food into our lives
without disrupting too much of its pre-estab-
lished ﬂow: ‘ ‘ " '

- The dinner party. What could be more
snobbish, more stupid, more haute-couture
than a dinner party? Outside of luncheons at
polo grounds, probably little to nothing. So
why not reclaim the ﬁm and good times

inherent m the dinner party and give it a col— V

legiate twist? _ ,

You don’t need a dinner table. You
don’t need any candles (although those can
sometimes be kinda cool). Just get some
ﬁiends together, enforce that they each bring
one prepared food item, and sit ‘em all
around a-room, stufﬁng their faces with
healthy recipes and ﬁlling their bellies with
some nice red wine (which, in moderation,
reduces the risk of heart failure). Sure, it’s
not as thrilling as the booty-grinding, loud-
music keggers we’re all used_to attending,
but wouldn’t it be nice to settle down for
once? " l r ,

0 In-class breaks. For those of us with
classes more than two hours long, breaks are
usually "a standard, provided that your pro-
fessor isn’t an ' evil overachiever who
demands every second of class time "for

instruction._ Pitt has graciously provided,

Second Plates and the Cathedral Cafe and
numerous vending. areasfor us to ﬂock to
during these breaks; unfortunately, the
majority of items available tend to be, on the
whole, junky, gross and all-around bad. i

‘ So why not pretend we’re all soccer
moms and assign one student per class to
bring, in orange, segments during break?
They are ﬁlled with vitamin C, ﬁll the room
with anice smell and have dual’ hunger-
thirst satisfaction. Or We don’t have to limit
ourselves tothe  snack
Someone could bring in pita and hummus or
tuna ﬁsh sandwiches. .

The point of this whole brouhaha is that it

we should start being more discriminatory

when it comes to ‘what we put in our

spending a little dough in order to do it
Otherwise, we risk the manifestation of

THE Prrr NEWS DINING GUIDE 9

Mass consumption of food __._ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ - _-__ _ _ _ _

is riddled with weirdness

DAVID C. MADDEN

The Pitt News g

In the realm of eating and dining out,
there is always a highly social factor.
Three. circumstances of proof:

1) the existence of restaurants

alone
'3) the position of the kitchen as
locus of a household. '
We humans like eating around each
other, and frankly, it weirds me out.

Let’s take phenomenon No. 1 first. '

Somewhere a long long time ago, some-
one decided to open business wherepeo-
ple could not only buy food but have it
prepared for them and eat it together. A
large room full of groups of people at
their own tables ﬁlling their mouths with
food ——- this isall a restaurant is, really.

A Does this practice strike anyone else.
as unusual? To the outsider (i.e., alien),

eating, being one of our basic necessities

j for life, would seem like a private prac-

tice. After all, if we eliminate the wastes

of the food we ingest privately, why,

ingest food in public? We don’t cleanse
ourselves in public, and we don’t repro-
duce in public — or at least we’re not
supposed to, but you’re always going to

I‘ have_ deviant rebels. —

 perhaps that’s how restaurants
got started. Some deviant rebels realized,

-- _“Hey, I don’t really like ingesting in a
‘ private place. How can I consume in a

public arena?” It’s a valid concern, want-
ing a communal place to share a basic
human need. V C
However the practice got started,
public food consumption is perhaps our

- most social activity and, probably has

been for as long as history can remem-
ber.

Which may begin to explain phe-
nomenon No. 2 — not liking to eat
alone. There’s a speciﬁc stigma of lone-
liness attached to anyone who is seen
eating alone in a publicplace. It’s not
enough that he or she is eating in the
company of complete strangers. One

2) the natural distaste toward eating

must be surrounded by friends or family
in order to make it a true dining-out
experience. . I

More often than not, this stigma of
loneliness is false. How many of us
either have nothing at home to eat —— and
need to run out for a bite — or need to
grab some food between classes and
have no time to find ﬁiends to eat with?

' Of course, when one does eat alone, he

or she is forced into looking occupied by

reading a book or newspaper or some—-
thing. Otherwise, he or she is pretty .

much labeled a freak.

So the desire to be among others
while eating is pretty manifest, but it’s
not only a— public phenomenon , and this

bring us to No. 3: the kitchen as social

center of a household.

Anyone who has ever taken Sign
Language I will tell you that the deaf
have characteristically large and well-
lighted kitchens. Why? Because they
understand and appreciate the kitchen as
a social center. ,

They, of course, aren’t the only ones
capable of this appreciation. Have you
noticed how oddly party activity will
migrate to the kitchen, even if the keg or
punch or other food items are located
elsewhere in the house? At home, my liv-
ing room is kept in immaculate condition
by my 'vacuum-and-dusting-addicted
mother, but I can’t remember the last
time I hung out with friends in that room.

My explanation for this phenome-
non is the kitchen’s closeness to the food
in a house. Chatting it up about
“American Beauty’s” various disap-
pointments? Why not do it within an
arm’s reach of some snacks? Trying to
ﬁgure out the name of the girl in that
class with that professor? Beer’s just a
few steps away in the fridge.

So next time you’re out and eating
with friends, take a second or two to look
at your. situation. Watch your friends eat
(yeah, it’s creepy, but I have a point), and
try to fully appreciate the intensely social
aspects inherent in this ritual. Then get
back to eating becausenow you’re start-
ing to stare.

the establishment after midnight, it
is well worth the trip.

For the crowd looking for a
place to stop and get a few slices of
pizza, Oakland offers a variety of
options.

There is Sorrento’s, where the
best pizza sauce in Oakland is used
to create a taste that will leave you
wanting more. Sorrento’s also offers
fine delivery service, and good
prices, which is a combo that should

suit many people working inthej

Oakland area.

Of course, the Atwood Deli is
one of the best places in Oakland to
dine outdoors. The people are good,

the music is better, and the pizza is
the greatest. If you’re a fan of white
pizza, then the Atwood Deli is the
place for you.

Napoli Pizza is another place
that has fine pizza. The cheese is
better here than at any other estab-
lishment in Oakland. I don’t know
what it is about the cheese, but it
just tastes better at Napoli.

The national pizza chains are
well represented here in Oakland. A
favorite of the students is Papa
John’s. Papa John’s has an excellent
thick crust pizza and features the
best cheesesticks around. The garlic
and cheese sauce to dip -your crust in
is an added bonus. '

Pizza Outlet is great at getting
large numbers of pizzas delivered in
a short" period of time. If you’re

hosting a party and you want to get
some pizza, Pizza Outlet is your
best bet.

Domino’s is another chain in the
area. Domino’s has good pizza,
good breadsticks, and usually has
good specials. The delivery is very
reliable, as well.

The other national chain is
Sbarro’s. The pizza is great,.but the
prices tend to be a bit high. If you
go there, skip the pizza and get the
pepperoni roll. You can thank me
later. - ' 0

Pizza Prima is good for those of
you living in North Oakland. The
pizza tastes great, and you usually
get a good amount of pizza for the
price that you pay.

I would also suggest University

Pizza as a good place for quick,

tasty and cheap pizza.

If you’re looking for specialty
pizza, try the “Duo Pizza” at Larry
and, Carol’s. It may not look great,
but the taste makes up for that. I can
eat a whole pizza from Antoon’s,

but I can’t eat more than four slices-

of the “Duo Pizza”. Believe me, that
was a compliment.

Minutello’s is a great place to go
for a nice, sit-down meal. The pizza
is good and the service is pleasant.

If you’re going into the city,
give Michael’ G’s a try. There is a
nice thick—crust pizza and great spe-
cials, which make it an easy deci-
sion when trying to choose whether
to eat there or not.

Down by Carlow College sits a
quaint restaurant called Sciulli’s
Pizza. The walk ‘from the main part
of campus is worth it, as a pizza
from there is always worth the
price. ‘ .

If you are traveling out of
Oakland in search of pizza, check
out Mineo’s Pizza House or Pi in
Squirrel Hill. Both places are
unique, but the one thing they have
in common is excellent pizza.

If you happen to be in
Bloomfield, then congratulate your-

self, because you have found “pizza '

heaven.” My personal favorite in the

neighborhood is Angelo’s,' with

Pizza Italia coming a close second.

The city is filled with great
pizza joints. If you’re in Millvale,
try the chicken wing pizza at
Frank’s Pizza. You might regret it a
few hours later, but for the few min-
utes that it takes to eat a slice, you
will love it.

Does all this make
you hungry? Well,
sometimes we have
free food just
lingering around
the office. And as a
writer, you’re cer- A
tainly entitled to
some of that grub.
Did I mention
you’ll get paid,
