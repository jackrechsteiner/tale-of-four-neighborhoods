SYDNEY BERGMAN
The Pitt News

The shadow of the toppled
World Trade Center towers hung
over Wednesday night’s Forum on
Global Justice. Held within the yel-
low walls of David Lawrence Hall
Room 121,, the meeting began -with
a moment of silence for all those
lost and their loved ones. As the
forum progressed, each speaker

touched on the theme of Tuesday’s

tragedy, connectingit with national

and global issues.

Organizers from Solidarity, a
Pittsburgh-based socialist group,
billed the gathering’s program as a
discussion of “globalization and
[the] ‘global agendas of the World
Bank and International Monetary
Fund.” »

These organizations, founded in
1944, lend , money to third—world
and developing nations. While the
World Bank strictly supports infra-
structure projects, the IMF subsi-
dizes their budget through a system
of loans and what the IMF terms
“structural adjustment programs,”
which reorganize country’s agricul-
ture and industry. Recently, both
organizations have attracted criti-
cism for these practices.

Wednesday’s conversation,
sponsored by the Sept. 30
Coalition, also revolved around the
upcoming protests in Washington,
D.C., where the World Bank and
IMF Summit will be held.

Still, the events surrounding the
World Trade Center and the
Pentagon disasters eclipsed this
goal. Solidarity spokesman Paul
LeBlanc said the hijackings “over-
whelm us with feelings of horror
and rage,” and remind people of the
“gift of life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness [as]
human rights.”

World Bank

The most prominent speaker,
Dennis Brutus, a South African
poet, activist and professor of
Africana studies at Pitt, did not
attend. Organizers gave no. reason
for his absence. l_ ’

But other speakers .filled the
discussion with analysis and cri-
tique of the international moneylen-
ders. Such speakers included Mary-
Alice Shebo, a Thomas Merton
Center board member; Robin

‘Alexander, a staff member at

United Electrical, Radio and

.Machine Workers of America and a

member of the . Metro Pittsburgh
Labor Party’s executive committee;
and Ramin Skibba, a Pitt student

speaking for the Green Party of T’

Southwestern Pennsylvania. ‘
Both Alexander and Skibba
spoke about. the functions of,-the

World Bank and the IMF" andhow.
these relate to the’ countries with_
which they work. Alexander sought_

to “analyze and criticize the global
institutions” in light of the attacks.
Continuing, she stated that activists
must speak out before the “terms of
acceptable debate narrowed.”
‘Skibba, in contrast, did not
make a direct reference to
Tuesday’s events. Addressing the

audience of about 50, Skibba’s'

speech called for “pluralistic
humanism” and “ecologically sus-
tainable development.” -

In contrast,
woman who spent much of the
meeting “knitting sweaters for her
grandtwins,” spoke on the “impact
of the World Bank and IMF on
everyday life and ‘human rights.”

experience-s as a human rights".

those listening “to dedicate...every

ounce of energy. every ounce of

tion” to “nonviolent resistance.”

Airports reopen with security restrictions

RICK NEFF
\ _ The Pitt News

Pitt students holding plane tick-
ets should be prepared to face" strict
new rules and regulations when ﬂy-
ing out of Pittsburgh International
Airport. On Sept. 13, the airport and

most major carriers reopened for

business nearly 48 hours after the
Federal Aviation Administration
grounded all ﬂights because of the
terrorist attacks in New York City
and-Washington. ’
According to Tom Baron, an
information clerk for the airport, the
following changes have been made

to help protect passengers ﬂying
into and out of the area.

For the indefinite future, no one
will be allowed past the metal detec-
tors without a ticket. So family
members and loved ones will notbe
able to greet arrivals at the gate.
Those ﬂying must check all bags
inside the airport, and all carry-on
luggage and curbside service has
been suspended.

Getting inside the airport will
also be more difficult. No vehicles
will be allowed within 300 feet of
the terminal. The, drop-off and pick-
up point has been moved to the
Airport Hyatt. The 300-foot safety

zone has also forced the closing of
the short—term parking lot; onlythe
long-term lots will be open to the
public. '

Restaurants in the airport such as
T.G.I. Friday’s were scheduled to
open on Thursday evening, but no
alcoholic beverages will be served in
the terminal. The AirMall will
remain closed until Friday.

US Airways, Delta and American
Airlines resumed ﬂying at 3 p.m.
Thursday. United Airlines, owner of
two of the hijacked ‘jets, has post-
poned all ﬂights until Friday.

For students who have. tickets
but choose not to ﬂy, there are sev-

eral options. All carriers are offering
complete refunds for tickets dated to
ﬂy in the next week and a half. Most
will allow transfers to a later date or
will apply the ticket price toward a
future purchase. For more complete
information, those with tickets
should call their airlines.

Both US Airways and Delta 3
declined to say how many people

canceled their Thursday ﬂights. But

several park-and-ride shuttle compa- ~

nies that transfer people to and from
the airport estimate that many poten-
tial passengers are choosing to stay
at home.

Pittsburgh Airbus shuttle service
said approximately one—third of their
reservations canceled.

Dennis O’Keefe, general manag-
er of Express Shuttle USA, said that
most of his drivers and vans were
“...pretty much sitting around
unused.”

“It’s safe to travel,” Baron said,-

“but those ﬂying should arrive at
least an hour early to allow time for
the extra security.”

Bush declares

day of prayer

President Bush has designated

3 today as a national day of prayer and

remembrance. Pitt invites members of
the University community to stop by
Heinz Chapel at any time between

12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. today as a _

contemplation. ‘ " -

“You don’t have to put up with
this,” Delaney said of the various
forms of harassment. “You have our
support.”

While staring is not a punishable
crime, Delaney and officers Kathy
Schreiber .and Debbie Walker
emphasized that students must report
all incidences. Even staring can
amount to harassment", Delaney said.

“We want you to get control back
in your life,” he said. _ .

Director of Residence Life

Denine Rocco reported that her

office has not beenofficially noti-
fied of instances of harassment.

' “We have seen thus far very little
evidence of that kind of thing,” she
said.

But she urged students to come

, forward and"told the crowd that

Residence Life was planning build-
ing-wide and ﬂoor-wide discussions
to be led by members of the
Counseling Center about ways to
cope with the crisis.

‘ Mitra, who moderated the infor-
mal gathering, collected suggestions
from students about how ' the
University can better attack these

problems. He suggested a student
volunteer escort service to accompa-

vny worried students. He also sug-

gested campus “safety zones” where
victims of harassment could report
incidents and escape. .

Other students suggested widen-
ing shuttle routes and establishing a
safety zone-specific Van Call van.

Director of Student Activities
Joe Cavalla volunteered the William
Pitt Union’s information desk as an
immediate safety zone. Student
Government Board President Jeff
Alex said zones could be set up in
public places such as the Towers
lobby or the Ashtray to serve as
escapes and means of education for
students who might be quick to
stereotype. Two other members of
the eight-person board, Michelle
Agostini and John Algie, joined Alex
at the meeting. _

Promises were made to look into

the feasibility of these solutions, and _

students were encouraged to attend
today’s open forum at 3 p.m. in
2K56 Posvar Hall. Alex reported that
SGB is attempting to schedule a
vigil for Tuesday morning. . A

“It’s only gonna be this tense for
a little while,” Mitra assured the

Staging an active, unified response

Across campus, members of the
University community have come togeﬂter
in different ways to mourn for the victims of
Tuesday’s attacks and to offer their support.

Some professors postponed their class-
es. Others facilitated discussions with their
students of these events. Many put off tests
and quizzes.

Tuesday we saw Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg walking around campus com-
forting students. The University did excel-
lent work infonning all members of our
community of the school’s closure that after-
noon, and Nordenberg’s response, sent via e-
mail to students and printed in yesterday’s
edition of The Pitt News, helped the

University community cope with our feel-

ings following the unprecedented tragedy.

Various campus organizations mobi-
lized within their own organizations_ to
mourn and offer support. But while these
eﬁorts — and the fact that organizations
have done them on their own — are laud-
able, the time has come for a coordinated
University response undertaken by either the
University administration or Student
Government Board.

Right now most students do not know
where to go. What if they don’t belong to
any organizations but still want to do some-
thing? . .
So far many students have gotten word
of different vigils by different organizations,
both religious and secular. It can be confus-

ing to decide which to attend and which ﬁt
your beliefs most. -

Today from 12:30 p.m. to 2:30p.m., the
University has designated Heinz Chapel as a
place for all members of the University com-
munity to come to meditate and reﬂect on
the tragedy. While this is a good step, it is not
enough. ‘ _

Some discussed the possibility of a non-
denominational, silent vigil on campus
Tuesday morning commemorating the one-
week anniversary of the tragedy.

SGB or the administration should coor-
dinate something along these lines, as they
have the resources and the scope to do so,
This should also take place at a distinctly
nonreligious location. They should also
coordinate other efforts to foster campus sol-
idarity. :

On Wednesday, freshmanlon Hill dis-
tributed yellow‘ ribbons. SGB and the
University should follow his lead.

We have also seen a lack of American
ﬂags on campus, something that SGB and/or
the University could — and should — recti-
fy. SGB and the University should encour-

age everyone to ﬂy ﬂags — and even dis— .

tribute them.

If ever there was a time for our campus '

to come together, it is now. We must be
active — we must reach out to others and not
wait for them to reach out to us.

The country has faced a national
tragedy. Let our response be unity.

After America’s left speechless

So where do we go from here?
Rarely does an event leave America speechless.
What can a person say after the world’s been turned

erless — as the numbers of casualties rise and the

..rubble is cleared .

So in a mixture of pity and guilt we try to give a

upside down? I think most of us still
have trouble comprehending what hap-
pened. How do you stare down the fac
of evil? .
Evil. That word echoes around the
world. We’re all grasping for some
way to express the inexpressible. With
our national sense of security shattered,
Americans feel lost and hopeless. But
in the face of darkness, I am struck by
how much light still shines through.

bit of ourselves away. People line the
Downtown streets of Pittsburgh outside
the Central Blood Bank and wait restless-
ly for hours to give what little they can.
Blood banks across the nation report sim-
ilar outpourings of patronage and support.
In reality, the blood given in Pittsburgh
will probably never leave the city 
Yet I believe we need to give. .
Giving is as much a part of the heal-
ing process for those of us removed from

The horror of Tuesday may
swamp the spirit, but emerging stories
of individual bravery, kindness and love help offset
the grief.

This is comforting evidence of the love of a
higher being, reminding us that nothing is truly
unbearable and offering us all a glimpse of comfort
in the corridors of fear. '

Faced with the kind of hardship that shakes
man’s faith and leaves him questioning his belief,
many people seem to draw conﬁdence from the love
that has emerged in the past few days. Maybe for
some this conﬁdence will lead to religious self-dis-
covery, or maybe it will fade as the terror subsides.
Regardless, I think we are all reaching out for some-
thing tangible, something to hold onto when every-
thing seems to be falling away.

Perhaps this is why the blood banks are ﬂooded
with donors. A deep chord in human nature leads us
to seek control of every situation. My most terrifying
memories arise from times when I felt lost or help-
less. We all like to feel in control, especially when the
world seems to be spinning out of it.

We can do little but sit back and watch — pow-

the chaos as receiving is for the victims.
Those who watch feel the need to help as
desperately as the wounded need assistance, and I
think this speaks strongly for a noble strain that lies
deep within the human spirit. ' .

No matter how dirty or cold mankind may
appear on the outside,’ the goodness  all of us
brightly afﬁrrns itself at times like these.

Much time will pass — as well it should --
before Americans begin to feel OK again. Death
should not be easily forgotten and an act of war must
never be taken lightly. But in spite of our wounds,
America will stand strong. ’ .

Truly, this is an hour when our national sp' 't is
being tested. Just as metal emerges from a ﬁre, shin-
ing and brilliant, the American people will overcome
the past week with renewed strength and luster. The

. things I have seen recently fortify my conviction that

we are a mighty nation. When the structures we
leaned upon fell to the ground, we were shaken but
did not fall. We stand, tall and proud, on our own.

Surviving terror and continuing the agenda

JOHN MARTIN JR.
The Pitt News

Where were you Sept. 11, 2001? Twenty years

from now, that question may be as common for our ‘

generation as‘ the John F. Kennedy assassination was
for our parents and Pearl Harbor for our grandparents.
Kennedy’s death and Pearl Harbor were American
tragedies of the most severe degree, but both pale in
comparison to the events of this bloody day. The
United States was viciously attacked by an unknown
entity, yet I feel that their , desired goal was only
achieved in part. ‘

The American people have not caved in to fear.
Our resolve to carry on our way of life has not been
weakened, nor has the resolve of the other ﬁee nations
who spoke out in our support. Our conﬁdence has
been temporarily shaken, our countrymen murdered
in cold blood and our economic center destroyed. Yet
we will carry on. _

You and I will each prepare for tomorrow and the
tomorrow after that in the hopes of building a better
world. This we owe to the fallen. ,

We as a people must decide where to go from

here. We must quickly ﬁnd and severely punish those '

who are responsible. We can no longer afford to give
those who would use terror against us a_ mere slap on
the wrist. I

Instead, we must turn the very fear these forces
use to promote their agenda against them. We must
bring devastation to ﬂiese individuals and the groups
that sponsor them, making our message very clear.

The message is simple: We will not buckle under _

the threat of terror. We will carry on, enjoying our life
and liberty, while working to promote these values
around the world. .

Some of my friends have suggested pulling out of
the Israel-Palestine conﬂict. I could not disagree
more. We must stand by a nation that today stood by
us. We must stand witha nation that promotes free-

. dom and that itself is under siege by terrorists. We

must make it crystal clear that we will never abandon
our allies. _ '

We as a people must make a concerted effort to
strengthen our national defense against all forms of
assault, both ‘foreign and domestic. We must develop
a national missile defense and increase spending on
intelligence of all kinds. We should work in the hopes
that this kind of tragedy never happens again on these
shores. : e

We must save other partisan quibbles for another
day. Today we must come together as a people, face
terror, and overcome it.

God bless America.

When one person  
changes the world

' NATHAN NOVOTNY
Kentucky Kernel p

(U-WIRE) LEXINGTON, Ky. — Nearly everyone
has asked the question, “I am just one person, can I
change the world?” The age-old question was answered
Wednesday. Early reports indicated Osama bin Laden
as the likely mastermind behind,Tuesday’s attacks.

Reportedly, bin Laden warned of the attacks three
weeks ago. Even if he was not responsible for the
attacks, one person started this vicious sequence of
events. The attacks we experienced Tuesday were the
direct result of one person putting an idea into action.
The answer to the question, “Can one person change the
world?” is a resounding yes. ‘ .

This attack exemplifies the type of world-changing
behavior we are seeing more often. For whatever rea-
sons, our world produces world-changers of primarily
one type: angry people licensing themselves to commit

~ atrocities in the name of whatever ﬂag they ﬂy.»

Yesterday, New York, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C., were rocked with that anger. Our
question has been answered, one person can change the
world. Wonderful, but what is the value if we aren’t.

world is much easier than healing it.

As Americans, - we are short-sighted. Our “big”
decisions of the day go something like this: Theyellow
shirt or the blue one? Will we go to the game or watch
it on television? Smoking or non? ‘

We waste our lives on frivolities. What are you liv-
ing for? No, better yet, what are you dying for? What
ﬂag do you ﬂy that affects every decision you make?
For most of us, our ﬂags read in big bold print: my
comfort. These choices we make, to hurry, past that
homeless person, to sleep in on Sunday and to shun the
undesirables all have one thing in common: If they hurt

"anyone, it certainly won’t be us. We are our highest pri-

ority. Our perspective of people and the world needs to
explode. ' A

The Middle East" experiences terrorist attacks more
often than you wear your favorite shirt. There are peo-
ple around the world who live in fear everyday while
we decide “paper or plastic.” Open your eyes. Live
each day dying for something of worth. Think deep
thoughts. Think serious. thoughts. What drives you? If
your answer involves you at all, your perspective is not
big enough.- Die for something other than yourself. I am
realizing more and more that my life is too precious to
spend on nothing. A

Osama bin Laden, Hamas and a mul-
titude of Palestinian groups, to name a
few.

The sight yesterday of the cele-
brating Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank should have sickened
every American; they were celebrat-
ing the mass murder of innocent
American citizens.

A declaration of war against ter-
rorism should simply contain a list of
every country and organization that
has in the past, or stated an intention
for the future, of committing or aiding
terrorist acts against the United States.

It has -been America’s inaction
against these countries and organiza-

tions for the last 30 years or more that

has permitted terrorism to fester and
grow like a cancer. And just as cancer
kills healthy bodies, terrorists killed
thousands of innocent Americans and
forever marred a beacon of civiliza-
tion and progress — the New York
City skyline. It is time to cut out and
obliterate the cancer of terrorism —
and its supporting ideology of Islamic
jihad —— before it spreads and ulti-
mately consumes more innocent and
healthy lives. »
The memory of the gleaming twi

towers of the World Trade Center and
its thousands of productive inhabi-

tants who perished Tuesday deserve
no less.

Resorting to violence sinks
to perpetrators’ level

I am a tired American today.’

Tired of hearing “inescapable
conclusions” and that we must “exact
retribution.” Tired of hearing how we
can “emerge triumphant” by striking
back in further. acts of terrible vio-
lence. Tired of the anger in which we
wallow, where ' clear-headedness

i might buoy us up. Tired of our unwill-

ingness to understand the “why”
behind such tragedies as Tuesday’s'
events. - .

How far are we willing to go in
the misguided path of revenge? How
many more times must we submit to
hate, and thereby perpetuate violence
that does not grow worse by mere
coincidence?

The only inescapable conclusion
after this historic tragedy is that many
people will have died in vain if we
respond to this injustice with vio-
lence. We carmot and must not. To do
so would be to continue playing a
game that we can never and will never
win. We must demonstrate that we are
no better than the perpetrators of this
horriﬁc ‘event, except that we are
capable of far greater, more calculated
swathes of destruction. .

We carmot guarantee our safety

 

until we finally understand why others
would lash out in this way and help
provide them an alternative to doing
so in the future. If we must punish,
then we must not do so with violence
or without understanding.

I am a tired American today, yet I
will be danmed before I spend my
remaining energy standing “united” in

' the solidarity of further violence. I

love this country, but I do not love it
enough that I am willing to hate for it.

Threats toward Middle
Eastern students appalling,
but not surprising

I was appalled by the stories I
have read in the Pitt News of our fel-
low students threatening other stu-
dents they deem Middle Eastern in
descent.

Appalled but not surprised

It seems there will always be a lot
of ignorant, uneducated people in soci-
ety spurred by a fear of the unknown
rather than intelligent thought.

All I can really offer the students
who feel threatened it this; Yes, there
are many eyes staring your way, some
accusatory, but do not put out of your
mind that some of those eyes, includ-
ing mine, cannot help but wonder what
you are going through and sympathize.

In our horror, revulsion and
sense of violation, Americans as a
people united in a way that only the
crucibles of crisis can make possi-
ble. It was a transient beauty made
visible only through the lens of this
tragedy.‘ _

Surely, the true character of the
American people will continue to
be tested in the coming weeks. The
uniﬁed spirit of Tues_day may be
pressed by political sniping, by ﬁn-
ger-pointing and, most regrettably,
by feelings of anger that may lead
to irrational, racist behavior against
innocent Arab- and Muslim-
Americans. .

Still, all this will be overcome.
America’ will continue to be, as

 True American character remains

President George W. Bush called it,
“the greatest beacon of freedom.”
What was lost on Tuesday was

‘steel and structure. Whatwas lost

was confidence and a‘ sense of
invulnerability. Most important and
most irreplaceable, what was _lost
were the lives of our mothers and
fathers, our sisters and brothers, our
friends and lovers, our heroes and
leaders.

What wasn’t lost was our sense
of our society, our feeling of being
part of something inﬁnitely larger
than our’ opinions, our politics,‘ our
identities, ourselves. What wasn’t
lost was America, and that is where
infamy failed.

Entertaining a
feeling of guilt

I’ve been thinking about this
column since Tuesday morning,
and two questions have entered
into my head. What do I write
about? Do I address the events of
this week, like every other jour-
nalist in the country, or do I pur-
sue my other idea for a column
this week — the sad state of song
lyrics?

As I left the William Pitt
Union Tuesday after classes were
canceled, I found myself tugging

Pourquoi?

Leslie Hoffman

 

on my miniskirt with a strong desire to change from
my frivolous high heels. Outside, the sun shone in the
clear blue sky, but as classes emptied, so did the street,
and the campus felt like it was on an eerie holiday.

I felt guilty.

I mean, what could I do? I felt as though, out of
respect for humankind, I should continue to watch the
news and whisper repeatedly, “This is so sad. I can’t
believe this is really happening.” But watching televi-
sion doesn’t solve anything.

I sat in my dorm for a bit but felt antsy. I wanted to

change because thevclothes I had put on that morning,
seemed inappropriate, and I felt that any action I did‘

seemed disrespectful. I

Finally, I ate some lunch because I was hungry, but
I couldn’t help thinking of the people in New York and
Washington, D.C., who had been working at rescuing
people all morning and were probably starving.

I returned to work at the Union and sat at my com-
puter editing entertainment pieces. But I felt silly

‘using the Internet to check‘ the spelling of the title of

Jadakiss’ last album as my co-workers read the

pp American Airlines Web site.

When I popped a CD into my computer, I felt as
though I was breaking hallowed silence, but I just
couldn’t take the tension any longer.

Why do I feel guilty about going aboutimy life?

Why does ‘entertainment suddenly feel-' inappropri-
ate? Is it disrespectful for me, here in Pittsburgh, to
attend a concert or listen to upbeat music, when ‘people
together parts of their? lives? . _ V

I don’t know the answer to that question.

in New York, and Wa,shi'ngt'on"- are. tryingto piece_}.back.,

But I do know that entertainment provides a neces-

sary emotional catharsis for us. Sometimes we need to
cry, but we’re ashamed to, and a movie or a song pro-
vides an acceptable excuse. Sometimes we just need to
laugh and let that serotonin rush through our blood-
streams.

It’s not healthy to let ‘feelings of guilt and depres-
sion build up inside-. Talk about them, spend time with
people you .love, exercise to release your tensions. If
you feel the need, watch a movie, go to a concert. Turn
off the television and go for a picnic in the park. Play
Frisbee, football, softball, challenge a bunch of little
kids to a basketball game. Breathe. ‘

Sing, dance, laugh. Celebrate life.

The‘ way It Has‘T,o‘Be, it states, “All sounds on this

"album were  using only‘ the human voice.”

Reading this, it would be reasonable to assume that the
music would be full of rich harmonies and devoid of
the electronic beats and sound etfects that are found
throughout pop music today.

Yet Ball in the House manages torecreate the
sounds of organs, chimes, violins and keyboards. Does
that seem amazing considering ﬂiey only use their

voices? It would be, if these sounds could possibly be "

reproduced live.

The background music is so overly produced that
to say it is vocal is true only in the broadest deﬁnition
of the word It seems that instead of using a synthesiz-
er like ‘N Sync or Britney Spears, they instead syn-
thesize their voices, creating the same effect, while still

smugly claiming to be an a cappella group; .
This overproduction would be excusable if the

ﬁnished product was fun to listen to. Unfortrmately,

the music keeps with the boy-band trend of unoriginal

chord progressions, predictable melodies and worse.

the House points out,‘ “You’re so tasty, tasty/Iwanna
eat you up in one bite/Tasty, tasty/You’ve got the right

In the years following their leg-

subsequent concert film, the Talking
Heads slowly began to dissolve as a
band, and front man David Byrne
emerged as not only leader but also
controller of the band’s sound and
direction. In 1992, three not unsuc-
cessful albums later, Byme officially
ended the Talking Heads, though they
hadn’t toured together. since those
aforementioned 1983 performances.

As the story goes, Byme was
already recording solo projects by
1981, and the other three band mem-
bers, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth
and Jerry Harrison, had formed a side
band called the Tom Tom Club, who
still tour.

The split was inevitable, as Byme
pulled the plug on the Talking Heads
as a stage entity — and eventually, as
a recording one — after Stop Making
Sense because he simply felt the

Now Byrne has established him-

with the funny voice from the Talking

It has been four years since Byme

Sports world
steps aside  

 

Sports Vlaw

Kenneth Paul -

The sports world is gingerly
handling Tuesday’s tragedy by tak-
ing a timeout for the weekend.

A coach calls a timeout in
sports because his team is tired, out
of sync or because the team is not
executing well and is being beaten
on the playing field.

Currently our nation is emo-
tionally stressed and tired. Every‘
citizen’s life is shaken and life as
we know it is not being executed in
the carefree blindness that the aver-
age person can enjoy on a day-to-
day basis. ,

A week ago, one of the "main
controversies on campus surround-
ed the $72,000 Panther statue,
which was placed outside of the
William Pitt Union. Isn’t it a sober-
ing slap in the face for all of us to
realize what is‘ important and what
is "not? t
On Saturday night, Sunday and
Monday, the talk around campus
focused on the football team’s dis-
appointing defeat to South Florida.
But those empty conversations
came to a screeching’ halt Tuesday
morning. . , -

Tuesday was. ‘a day that none of
us will ever forget. It erased all of
the bubble-gum controversies and
topics of conversation that preced-
ed the tragic day. There isstill a
numb, confused state in my head
and riveting through my body.
What are the correct emotions to
have? Is there a right or wrong way
to mourn?

The sports world has decided to
take itself out of the picture; to step
aside. i

For many: sports fans, Saturdays

BRIAN GOLDMAN

This Saturday’s Pitt football game
against the University of Alabama-

because of Tuesday’s tragic events in
the United States.

Pitt and UAB mutually agreed on
this decision. All other Pitt sports
events this weekend, including volley-
ball, soccer and cross country events
have also been postponed.

“This tragedy has hit a nerve in

Steve Pederson said. “We have sus-
pended competition in all of our sports ,
through the weekend out of respect for
our great losses. Our thoughts, prayers
and heartfelt support go out to the vic-

athletics is not appropriate at this time.”

Women’ssoccer splits two battles

CHRIS PAPST
‘ The Pitt News

Entering last Friday’s game
Pitt’s
women’s soccer team was both men-
tally and physically ready for the
challenge. After hours of watching
tapes and training, the Panthers were
excited about going into North
Carolina and playing tough.

Coach Roland Sturk and his team
returned to Pittsburgh Sunday night
with an even more positive attitude.
After beating a tough ’Western
Carolina team 3-2 and losing a heart-
breaker to the University of North
Carolina-Greensboro 3-1, the team
felt they could play with anyone.

Pitt 3, Arizona 2 I
The Panthers jumped out to a

quick start as Jacqueline Fix scored‘

her second goal of the season only
17-minutes, 26 seconds into the
game’. Cande Ruiz assisted Fix’s
goal, her third of the year. The first
half ended with Pitt up 1-0.

Pitt continued to press early into
the second half as Kimberly Sturk
assisted Ruiz, who scored her sec-

ond goal of theseason at the 52:35

mark.

“I am very happy the way that
[Ruiz] is playing for us,” Sturk» said.
“She has two goals now and three
assists, plus she adds a lot of spirit to
the team.”

Down two goals, Western
Carolina mounted a comeback as
Kelly Barker scored an unassisted
goal at the 52:55 mark, just 20 sec-
onds after Ruiz’s goal. This was

_Barker’s ﬁrst goal of the season.

Shortly after Barker’s tally,
Western Carolina tied the game as
Jordan Howell scored her second
goal of the season, off a direct kick
from 20 yards out.

The game would not be tied long
though. Katrina Shabata scored with
15 minutes left in the game from a
direct free kick from the top of the
box.

The game did not go without
penalties. There were 19 fouls
called, 10 against Pitt and nine for
Western Carolina. There was no
shortage of action either as 25 shots

.were placed on goal, 14 by
Pittsburgh and 11 by Western
Carolina.

' Goalkeeper Gretchen Ross-

earned her third victory of the year, -

making ﬁve saves.
“We were very conﬁdent that we
could score,” Sturk said. “We had a

little defensive breakdown there for.

a while, but the girls fought back
hard and got a good victory.”

co-captain shot a solid ball that
sailed past a diving Gretchen Ross
into the far right upper corner.

The Panthers fought back and
narrowed the margin when Annette
Agredano scored her second goal of
the season with 20 minutes left in
the game. -

UNC-Greensboro put the game

out of reach just as quickly as
Pittsburgh got back into it. Six‘min-
utes after the Panthers scored, Rakel
Logadottir beat her defender‘ on the
left wing and crossed the ball per-

fectly to Kate Daylag for her ﬁrst

goal of the season.
“We deﬁn-itely came out ready to
play this afternoon,” said UNC-
‘Greensboro head coach Eddie
Radwanski. “This team needs _to
come out and play like that every
time they step onto the ﬁeld. There
will be times where they will be off,
but intensity and effort should never
be of .”

The Spartans improved their-

record to 3-1 and the Panthers" fell to
2-2. , \

Today’s match against St. John’s
and Sunday’s contest
Arizona have both been postponed
because of the terrorist attacks that

team”

The low-scoring game was very
physical as eight cards were handed
out in the match, with five going to
Panthers. Toure Weaver, Clay
Haﬂich, Mark Sikora, Nate

,Montgomery and Jeff Krause all

received cards for infractions.

Birmingham-Southern 3, Pitt 2.

(double overtime)

Sunday’s contest against the
Panthers of Birmingham-Southern
(1-3) went into double overtime,
despite the fact that Pitt scored the
first two goals of the game.

Chris Churchill scored the first
goal for Pitt off a rebound 6:21 into
the match. Peter Veltri made the
score 2-0, when he scored off a cross
pass from Bryan Hopper, in front of
the goal at the 20:10 mark.

The Blazers came back quickly
though, making the score 2-1 when
Jamie Holmes scored in the 40th
minute of the game.

With only 59 seconds remaining

in the game and the Panthers leading
2-1, Birmingham—Southern’s Paul
Munro scored on a free kick to send
the game into overtime. '
Five minutes into the second over-
time, Falk Terjek scored on a penalty
kick, giving Birmingham—SOuthern
the victory 3-2. '

“This was a game that we could
have won,” Luxbacher said. “We
played two games in 18 hours. It
seemed like we just didn’t have any
legs.”

Churchill and Gaul were chosen
for the all-tournament team, along
with Birmingham_—Southern’s Jamie
Holmes and Kevin Kosek.

The Panthers looked to bounce
back after the two losses at the Nike
Classic, but Wednesday’s game
against the Duquesne Dukes was
canceled because of Tuesday’s
tragedies in New York and
Washington. . The team’s match
against Georgetown scheduled for
Saturday has also been postponed.
There have been no rescheduled
dates announced for the postponed
matches.

Sports and fans take a timeout to mourn losses

destroyed Pentagon. p

This is a time to enjoy the free-
dom that these terrorists have tried
to snatch away from us. This is a
time to take advantage of our cam-
pus, to get to know the thousands of
students that frequent the Cathedral
lawn, Schenley Park and the student
union.

This is the first feeling of
nationalism that "many of us have
felt before. Things are notas safe as

they once were. There is no more

room to be naive.

. No longer are thoughts with
Barry Bonds and his quest for the
home-run record. People are not
concerned with the Miami-
Washington game or the pennant
races. It is time to rebuild from the
inside.

Symbolically, the destruction of

J the World Trade towers was a blow

to the nation. Thousands of people
are dead along with a fixture of one
of our nation’s skylines.

But one must imagine that the
towers will be resurrected quickly.
A hole will not remain in New York
for long. It will be rebuilt to show
our nation’s strength. People will
treat each other better because no
matter what religion or color we
are, we all have the common bond
of being Americans and our pride
will be stronger than ever.

Soon enough we will continue
with our traditions. The Sept. 27
game against Miami will be a spe-
cial night in Pittsburgh. I know my
ears need the comfort of hearing
“The Star-Spangled Banner” and,
for the sake of American tradition, I
look forward to getting together
with 65,000 other Americans to
cheer on our football team.
