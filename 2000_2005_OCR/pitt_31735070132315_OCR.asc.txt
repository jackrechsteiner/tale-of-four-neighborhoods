PETA, VAL protest circus visit

Staff Report '

The circus coming to town does‘

not spark euphoric joy and childhood
nostalgia for everyone. For many
animal rights activists, it sparks rage.

People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals has launched a campaign
against traveling circuses such as

Ringling Brothers and Barnum &l

Bailey. PETA claims that Ringling
Brothers consistently fails to meet
the standards of the Animal Welfare
Act, beats and intimidates animals

_ into performing unnatjuralbehaviors
‘and habitually neglects sick or

injured animals, causing death.

So wherever Ringling Brothers‘
tours, PETA follows, organizing and
providing supplies for grass-roots
groups who demonstrate outside cir-
cus venues. ‘

When Ringling Brothers began a
four-night engagement. at Mellon
Arena Wednesday, demonstrators,
including Pitt’s Voices for Animal
Liberation, were on hand. ‘

“These animals don’t deserve to
be in chains any more than you or I,”
said VAL member Daniel Moyer.

Since Mellon Arena has various

Pitt‘wants students. to go to
Heinz Field Saturday morning, and
they’re offering free parking and
shuttle services to bring students
there for the filming of ESPN’s

_“College GameDay.”

While there, organizers expect
students to show spirit and repre—.
sent the school. . _

They also expect that some
students will drink.

“I would anticipate that there

-would be some .tailgaters,” said

E.J. Borghetti, the associate athlete

ics director for,media relations.

“That’s just a part of the football
culture.” . ' ’
But, deviating from the routine

vtailgatersare used to, every stu-

dent who takes‘ advantage of the
free parking in the Gold Lot at
Heinz Field will have to drive
away at 12:30 p.m., when the film-
ing of the show has ended.

“We would encourage students
not to drink and drive,” said Liz
Culliton, the‘ Student Government
Board president. “It’s a s'cary con-

Culliton said she did not_
believe that anyone had officially
addressed the issue of students
tailgating and then driving home.

“They can hopefully take ,
advantage of the transportation
available,” Culliton said, referring
to the shuttle service that will run

~— between Pitt and Heinz Field from

9:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m.

Culliton. added that she would
rather drive carsiout of the 1other—

filming of the show —— might be“

‘less conducive to excessive drink-t

ing than the normal student lot.
“There are going to be people
"watching them,” she said.
“They’re not going to let extreme-
ly intoxicated students anywhere
n.ear {the filming].’’
Culliton was "also optimistic

about the students who will attend‘,

the event. _

“The students who are going to
come down there are probably
going to be smart,” she said. it

Borghetti also said that he does

not expect tailgating. to be the

main attraction Saturday morning.
“Anyone making the ‘trip down
there, they wouldn’t be so focused
on having a tailgate in the free lot
as they would be to see the show
taking place,’-’ Borghetti explained.
“As it relates to the. morning
hours, when "“GameDay” is going‘
on, I don’t think that the parking

lot is going to be where the fun

and the action is,” he added. “I
think that’s all going,’ to be taking
place around the “GameDay” set
on the Great Lawn.”

’ Students will be busy enjoying
free hot chocolate, coffee and
Slurpees, compliments -of 7:
Eleven, according "to Borghetti.

Borghetti’ also said that no
added ‘security would be brought
in for the event. ‘

“We’ve had a great plan in

"place/, in terms of security, for the

last’ three years‘ at Heinz Field,”
Borghetti said. “We’ve had big
games before, where we’ve been
sold out, and we’ll have big games
where we’re sold out again.”
“Certainly, there’ve been high-
profile .situations at sporting
events where there havebeen some
security concerns,” he added.
“We’ve' got great fans, we’ve got

.. great students, and I think we’re

going to pu_t on a first-class event.”

“Ever.ybody’s safety and well-
being will be a major priority, but
I don’t foresee any issues,”
Borghetti said.

Succinct writer wins

HALI FELT
Staff Writer

Short is good.

And so is concision.

At least that’s what Rick Moody
said, in so many ways and words, to
an audience in the Frick Fine Arts
auditorium Wednesday night.

He read with Suzanne
Greenberg, this year’s recipient of
the Drue Heinz Literature Prize, as
part of the Pittsburgh Contemporary
Writer’s Series. Moody, this year’s
judge, chose Greenberg as the win-
ner because of what he called her
ability to see the moments of

drama, pick out the parts of them‘
that were important and then ‘leave ”

those moments without lingering on
them too long. A
“A lot of times in contemporary

fiction, the drama goes on longer

than it has to,” Moody said.

Neither’ of these writers seemed
to have that problem.

Greenberg read first, beginning
with the story p“The Queen of
Laundry,” which told of a middle-
aged divorcee whose hippie-chick
mother moved into her house.
Because ‘of custody decisions, the

divorcee’s daughter only lived there ‘

50 percent of the time, and the
woman of the title, Carmen, only
came to do the housekeeping once a
week.

Although the story dealt with,

the relationships between mothers
and their daughters, it didn’t senti-
mentalize. The momentslof tender.-
ness and rawness spiked through
the humor of the rest of the story,
but were never in danger of taking
it over.

The divorcee volunteers at her
daughter’s school library once a
week so that she can “skim her fin-
gers over her daughter’s knuckles”
on the weeks that she doesn’t see
her. She wonders if “otherparents
hunger after their children,” before
going into the girls bathroom“ to

' write “your mother loves you”_ on
' the doors of the stalls in permanent

marker. ' A
The divorcee apparently has
issues with “impulse control,” and
as such, after a therapy session in
which her therapist asks her to talk
a. little bit about the graffiti, she
writes the words “impulse control”

the Drue Heinz award

on the freshly painted stall doors
while attending a parents’ day at the
school.

Moody read several of what he L

called his “very short” pieces, start-
ing with one about the chain of
events leading to a “thirsty interfac-
er” getting his drink of water, and
moved from what he called “the
ridiculous to the ridiculous,” to
read a story called “Cheese: The
Proposal.” _

In it, the narrator, who does not

seem to be the actual cheese-hater,

relates some interesting informa-
tion about both cheese and Stan
Powell, who “finds cheese disturb-
ing.” ‘
Powell wants- to know what the
“inventor of cheese” was thinking
and why “certain people like really
awful kinds of cheese, -and certain
people do not, and why some peo-
ple think that Stilton is a food.”
The “monumental conclusion”

of theproposal-appeared.to be two-.

fold: that “cheese is about death,”
and that “civilization is dependent
on cheese.” _

The next story that Moody read
was one part of a i’five-part‘collec-
tion of intersecting narratives tak-
ing place atthe Free Library ‘in
Philadelphia. “Jumping Rope
Girls,” was about a “storm of girls,
a storm "of thunder, a mighty
scourge,” known as the Jumping
Rope Girls‘; ‘

_Told from the point of view of
the girls, the story took on the tone

of ,a manifesto when discussing the '
collective no—n_onsense thoughts of .
the rather badass Jumping Rope

Girls.

good for us, we exercise because
it’s pleasure and pleasure is a pre-
rogative for Jumping Rope Girls,”
Moody said. -

One girl, about another of them,
said, “Dolores says she needs a bra,
but what does she need it for?”

Moody’s last story, “A Short
Philosophical Primer,” was a list of
many things that are “good.” A C

‘ A “People with extremely large‘
eyes, are good,” Moody said. As are

blurry photographs, sleeping with
someone and “forgetting the explo-
sive part”'and the “repetition of the

word ‘good’ until it is drained of all '-

meaning.”

entrances, three groups of five stood
in various entrances to maximize the
chances of patrons seeing them.
Activists held signs reading
“Cruelest Show on Earth,” counter-
ing Ringling’s slogan “Greatest
Show on Earth,” and posters depict-
ing animals behind cages with the
message “Help Me,” on the bottom.

VAL urges people to consider the
Cirque du Soleil and Circus of the
Children as alternatives to Ringling
Brothers. ‘

“You don’t have to go to an ani-
mal circus to see animals do unnatur-
al tricks when you can go to a non-
animal circus and see humans do
unnatural tricks,” Meyer said. These
campaigns are ones of misinforma-
tion according to Jenifer Maninger,
public relations director for Ringling
Brothers.

“These organizations take inci-
dents and misconstrue them,”
Maninger said. “They take incidents
and twist the facts.” ’

Maninger said PETA, in particu-
lar, is a solely political organization
that uses money donors meant for
animal care on PR stunts. »

“They want to tell people what
they can eat, what they can wear and
how to use their entertainment dol-
lar,” she said. “They don’t have
[any] kind of animal sanctuary. They
don’t have any shelter for animals.
They are not supporting any kind of
research to help preserve species.”

Maninger is confident that show-

goers will be convinced that PETA is
wrong.

“I think the thousands of people
who see our show each night can see
that our animals are healthy ani-
mals,” Maninger said. “They see the
truth, that these animals have a bond
with their caretakers and that they
are well—cared for animals.”

Ringling Brothers has never been
found to be in violation of the
Animal Welfare Act, according to
Maninger. She said that all of the
“violations” PETA mentions are
either one—time incidents blown out
of proportion or “mi.nor housekeep-
ing issues.” She used an open feed-
bag as an example. _

Documents from the United
States Department of Agriculture
reveal a somewhat darker picture.

A USDA inspection report stated -.

that vent failure in a transportation
car carrying tigers “pushed tempera-
tures to a point of immediate danger
to animals.”

_ A USDA memo states that ele-
phants were chained in a manner that
caused severe scars on their legs.

USDA testimony in front of the
Secretary of Agriculture stated that
Ringling handlers failed to handle an

ill juvenile Asian elephant “in a man— A

ner that did not causebehavioral
stress and unnecessary discomfort.”

Brandi Valladolid, coordinator of
PETA’s circus campaign, defended
her organization against Ringling
Brothers.

Cruelty not only way to train animals, trainers can be creative

Circus, page 4

Valladolid said that Ringling is
the one who twists the truth.
' “Ringling likes to say ‘We’ve
never been cited by the USDA 
The USDA is not a citation-issuing
organization. What they do issue are
called non-compliances and non-
compliances do indicate that they are
in violation of the Animal Welfare
Act.”

According to Valladolid, animal
circuses are intrinsically cruel.

“There is no way to steal animals
out of the wild and force them to per-
form, force them to jump through
ﬂaming hoops, ship them around the

country in boxcars and be humane,”
' she said. '

“The only way to get these ani-

mals to perform is through billhooks, I

shook prods, whips,” she said.
This is not precisely true, howev-

er, according to John C. Wright, a T

professor of psychology at Mercer

"University and ‘a’ certified Animal

Behaviorist. I \
“The notion that you must use
force to get a wild animal to do

something is wrong,” he said. Wright '

cited trained dolphins that perform
tricks at theme parks using a token
system of treats. '

More peculiar behavior is some-
what different, though. Wright avoid-
ed using the word “cruel” —— “Cruel
is a value judgment and not a word
scientists use” — but said that train-
ers may have to be “creative” to
entice an elephant to stand—up on its
back-legs and catch a ball.

One official did have a more
definitive answer towards whether
Ringling Brothers and Barnum '&
Bailey is cruel or not.

Robert Gosser, a Humane
Society police officer, who inspected

the circus Thursday said Ringlinga
Brothers was “wonderful” in their

care of animals.

The Humane Society checks th

“Ringling Brothers is among the

Fun? Cruel? Natural? Unnatural?

City smell not worth threatening to

More than three hundred
Pittsburghers got really pissed off
last week — some to the point of
making death threats.

Darby Conley’s syndicated
comic strip, “Get Fuzzy,” which runs
in 400 papers around the world --
but not in any Pittsburgh papers —
made a punchline of Pittsburgh when
Bucky Katt, a character in the strip,”
asks a travel agent about “packaged
trips based primarily on smell,” and
the agent replies, “Have a look at
this pamphlet from the tourism
department of Pittsburgh.”

Conley reports having been con-
tacted by between 300 and 400
annoyed readers, ranging from
friendly reminders that the city is no
longer a sooty industrial town to ire-
filled missives to death threats.

8 Apparently Pittsburghers are
harder than they seem. The comic’s
perceived insult to the city is fairly

innocuous and childish. Sure, a‘

response to such a razz is called for.
But death threats?

Pittsburghers generally are divid-
ed into two camps: those whose
blood runs Steelers black and gold,
who eat jumbo sammiches when they
can’t get to Primanti’s, who use a
sweeper when the room needs gredd
up — and those leave town after
graduation. The latter are bemoaned
and blamed for the city’s woes. The
former are a force to be reckoned

(1

with.

While it’s great to see such rabid
civic pride, it’s unnerving to think
that there are those who would kill
— or at least say they’d kill — to
defend the honor of our city. And it’s
not as if the insult was so dreadful.
The comic didn’t say the city
smelled bad, it just implied a certain
aroma. Sure, ‘that strikes a nerve in
light of Pittsburgh’s former fume
problems, but is an insinuation of
stink really worth threatening a
man’s life?

The city is changing. Pittsburgh
is up and coming as an artistic haven
and- a cultural destination, and a lot
of hard work ‘has gone into making
that happen. So, it’s natural for citi-
zens to resent being called smelly the
world over. But making deathrthreats
is a stride backwards for the city’s
reputation. -

A few years back, the Daily
Show did a feature on Kennett
Square, Pa. -— calling it Stinkytown,
USA. The town is famous for grow-
ing mushrooms, which grow in
manure, so the town does stink.
Residents there were thrilled to be in
the spotlight, however dubious it
may have been. It was national pub-
licity for a little town. ’

Maybe Pittsburgh could take a
page out of Kennett Squ'are’s book
and be happy to be getting free
worldwide publicity.

Rad trips a tegra part of college

Every once in a while, you have to get
the hell out of Oakland. I know its serene
atmosphere and ‘relentless beauty bear an
obvious draw, and cause an endless black

hole effect for some residents. But for those ’"

who aren’t blind and have -
some form of concern for
hygiene, sometimes you just

 

happened to be an actual closet into which

a bed and TV were squeezed, disguising
the true identity of this storage area.

Let it be said that college students are
nothing if not adaptable. I set up camp with
"my head wedged between a

My friends and I hit the road one
weekend for the most unPittsburgh of all
destinations — State College. We perse-
vered through Friday afternoon traffic,
adding enough extra time to our journey to
make all of our asses go numb. Cramped

and hungry, we emerged out of the vehicle A

ready to take on Happy Valley.
And take it on, we did. We represented

our beloved Pitt as best we could. We ’

worked the beer pong tables, rocked out
some ﬂip cup games, and didn’t put up with
anyone jeering us with cheers of “Pitt

not worthy of printing. . .

The partying lasted into the wee hours
of the morning when it was time to crash.
This is where the bliss of the road trip takes
a temporary hiatus. Sleeping anangements
on these endeavors never quite reach the

got back on the road.

The drive - home was much more

Just as Achilles had to cope with

‘his decrepit tendon, just as The

Beatles had to cope with Ringo Starr,
I mustcope with my inability to meet
girls. While I may be well informed
on what makes a good-date, do not

lookto me when it come-s to actually‘

getting a date. Truly, I am a lonely
person, —- the thousands of people
who have never met me will attest to

- that — but at least’ I have my dignity.

I refuse to be one of those many

enough to come up with a ‘more

other hand, those very same vulgar

' It’s about time we usher in a new
era of dating — an era in which the.

idols. Ladies, consider the advan-
tages: We can provide excellent con-
versation; we do not smell like Lance
Armstrong’s tube socks; we spend
more time away from the gym which
equates to more time with our roman-
tic interest; we do not normally look
as if pur bodies were sculpted from
beefcake; and — now thistis the real
kicker —— we spend so much time
researching sex that we could-show
you things you did not think were pos-
sible. .

In my lifetime, I have known sev-
eral girls who move from boyfriend to

“boyfriend, each time complaining fre-

quently about what an’ insensitive
bonehead he is, yet these girls are

time‘ and time again drawn to that

aforementioned sweat sock siren
song. Ladies, I think the moment is’
right for you, as a gender, to start say-
ing “No” to Joe Sweat'Sock.

Would you rather spend your time
with a guy, who will make martinis for
two» and spend the night in front of a
warm fire, or would you rather watch
-your date guzzle a few dozen beers,

-tget creative, and see if he can drink a

low-pitched grunts? Would you/like to

term papers you’ve been

just bone, or,would you rather just
bone with someone who may actually
have the common courtesy to ask your
name? Given these situations, I would
say the quiet guys have the upper
hand.

‘Of course, there’s a catch.
Unorthodox as it may be, the girl will
normally need to ask for the first date,
not the guy. But that is not so bad, is
it? The guy does the driving, he buys
the dinner, he purchases the tickets, he
takes care of the drinks and desserts
later, and all the girl has to do is ask.

Trust me, even as we may be
romantics at heart, when quiet guys so

much as think about asking a girl on a
date, they shrivel up like slugs in a
salt mine. Granted, we are well-
groomed and interesting slugs. So go
ahead. Ignore that big guy behind you
yelling, “Take off your shirt,” and find
a nice, quiet guy who seems dating
impaired. Take a chance, and find out
what he’s doing next Friday night. If
he says, “I’m going to sit alone at my

When protesters find something to say, perhaps they’ll be heard

By Donald Cohen-Cutler
The California Aggie
California-Davis)

(U.

(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. - Over
the past few years, there have been
fantastic rallies with large papier—
mache puppets and longhaired hip-
pies dominating the streets of
Washington, D.C., New York City,
San Francisco and many other cities
around the world.

It is fun to pretend that these
protests really matter that much.

Hey, I like a rally as much as the
next bleeding-heart liberal, but I
call them what they are: organized

whining.

These rallies tend to feel like
festivals and do not address the
problem. They are therefore inef-
fective and usually will not inﬂu-
ence the decision-makers.

For one, the government does
not listen to the clever rhyming
chants of passing protesters because
protesters do not vote in blocs.

If they did, protests would be
called social v action and would be
much less hip; however, it would be
much more effective.

Voting is the most powerful tool \

citizens of the United States have in
their civic arsenal. Yet money in

politics has pushed a disillusioned
public to believe that their votes are
meaningless. Perhaps they are right.

But in reality, if all of the long-

haired hippies and puppet—wielding

dissidents voted for a common
cause, perhaps the vote would take
back some meaning;

I was in attendance lastspring
during a major anti—war demonstra-
tion in New York City. It was very
fun to be in Washington Square
Park with hundreds of thousands of
very pissed—off people. Groups

from all over the New York area
were there to voice their opposition
to the\war in Iraq.

I asked a few people how they
had voted in the last election. Most
told me that did not matter.

Really? Voting obviously led to
someone taking office that a major-
ity — if not all — of the protesters
disagreed with.

Voting matters, and is a more

effective instrument of change than-

screaming with a hundred thousand
of your closest friends on a
Saturday afternoon.

.Another reason that modern ,

protesters have not been placated

I with fulfilled demands is that no
one knows what they ‘really want. p

During the 2000. Democratic
Convention in Los Angeles, I was
privileged to witness the presiden-
tial nomination of
President Al Gore, and then go out
to my car to watch thousands march
through the streets of L.A. -

What was strange was the multi-
tude of signs. “End the War on
Drugs,’_’ “Free Mumia,” and “End
the Occupation! Free Palestine”

were just a few of the many posters .

beingdisplayed. _

The chant was
response: _

Leader: “What do we want?”

The group answered with many
demands in a mufﬂed shout.

- Leader: “When do we want it?”

The, group knew the answer to
this: “NOW!”

I felt like yelling back, “Get
your act together and then start ask-
ing for something, you morons.”
Butl kept my mouth shut in fear for
my ‘life. _

The fact that no one, not even
the protesters themselves, under-
stands their demands means that the
“demands” will probably never be
granted. ‘ ’ . ’

“Ask and ye shall receive.”

Protests are not new anymore.
They do not anger the old estab-
lished “community as much as. they

a call _and

did during the 1960s. In fact, many I
. established community members

take part in these protests.

Many of those that marchedon‘

Washington to end the Vietnam War

‘are now living in Washington as

members of the government. The
thrill is gone. ' A
Mass movements have lost their
ﬂair simply because people are’ just
marching and screaming. In the
past,
screamed for one set of demands
and voted in blocs. The people of

the street have changed history

before —‘ when they acted together.

Hopefully the utopian street’

marchers of today will lookito their
parents and ‘older marchers for
inspiration.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 10

Another piece of American currency is being over-
hauled by the U.S. Mint After the paper money, save the
one—dollar bill, went through its drastic facelift, and quarters
had their tails changed to represent the 50 different states, it
was reported on Thursday that the nickel has been chosen to
be altered.

The nickel, which currently bears the likeness of
Thomas Jefferson on its face and Monticello on its tail, has
been unchanged since 1938. That change created the current
nickel and did away with the buffalo, or Indian head, nickel.

Beginning in the spring of 2004, the nickel will be used
in the continuing celebration of the bicentennial of the‘Lewis
and Clark expedition. And, ironically, the changes in the
works for the nickel include something of a restoration of the
Native American likeness and culture to the coin.

The nickel’s tail will be changed to include two hands, a
white man’s and a Native American’s, clasped in ﬁiendship.
Above this will be a crisscross of a tomahawk and a peace
pipe, images,according to a story posted on Yahoo.com, that
“represent peace” and are similar to those included on
J eiferson Peace Medals, which were ceremoniously given to
tribal chiefs during Lewis and Clark’s trek

The nickel will then go through a second change in the
fall of 2004, where the image on the tail will be that of Lewis
and Clark on the keelboat they used in the expedition, before
returning to a slightly modiﬁed version Jefferson/Monticello
nickel we all know and love. .

While changing the face, and tail, of money is a neat
marketing trick on the part of the U.S. Mint, the ﬁrst change

that will happen to the nickel seems to
be in particularly poor taste. _

It’s ﬁne that the Mint wants to
commemorate Lewis and Clark and
Jeiferson’s role in both the expedition
and the Louisiana Purchase. But is this
really the way to go, to show a Native
American and white man locked in a
grip of friendship, with a peace pipe
above it, no less? I don’t think so.

If anything, the Lewis and Clark
expedition opened the Louisiana
Purchase territories to the destruction
and damn near genocide of most of the
United States’ native population while

is wrong. _

The second new design for the
nickel is perfectly acceptable. What bet-
ter way to honor two heroes of the
young nation than to show them in full-
blown hero mode on their boat?

But this ﬁrst design is just awful.
There is no reason why such a design
needs to exist on American currency.
While the'y’re at it, the Mint should just
put some other derogatory image on the
face of the nickel to go along with the
disgusting misrepresentation that
appears on the tail.

seems as if they would ever have any
trouble ﬁnding an audience. Playing
out of their Honda Civic seven years
ago, the couple may _not agree. And
only in the past two years did they take
a chance by moving from their home-
town of Nashville, Tn., to Los Angeles,
playing at every open mic night and
college concert available.

Wilshire’s single, “Special,” calls
up an image of their experiences and

their hopes for a better day to come. It -

must have worked: “I’m looking for a

songs seem to stand out, “Special” and

songs on the album and be mesmerized
by Lori’s astonishing voice.

There is hardly any female vocalist
out in the rock world that could be

Silence this

A Silent Hill 3

Developed by Konami TYO
Published by Konami

’ PlayStation 2

it

y There I was, alone in the dark, planning
on spending the second evening before
Halloween playing a nice, spooky video
game. The disk spun up; the credits

appeared; the incredibly long load time had '

elapsed. It seemed like an eternity of silence,
an inﬁnite seclusion in the bloody terror of
the game, before the screams of the tortured
rang out like wind through a partially ajar
Towers window.

“Dear God, this is the worst game
I’ve ever played! l l”

I probably managed to scare a number
of innocent trick-or—treaters outside, but
they were probably expecting it anyway. I
understand that this game was supposed to
be more about a cinematic fn'ght—fest than
an action—packed shoot—em—up, but I think
they’ve crossed the line between “artistic”
and “unplayable” in Silent Hill 3.

As Heather, a 17-year-old girl, you
wake up from a nightmare (the first level)
and find yourself in a mall terrorized by
—— a thing. It’s about seven feet tall,
vaguely human-shaped (except for mas-
sive arms), and its head keeps twitching
like a 5-year-old in a candy store._ So, in
typical 17-year—old—girl style, you pick up
the gun that just happens to be lying there_

-and shoot the thing. After emptying a clip,
. it falls. Enjoy it while it lasts, because

tl1at’s the only time the combat system
seems to work. . .

The controls make P.N.O3 — that hor-
riﬁcally unplayable GameCube game -—
feel downright responsive. The biggest 
problem is that the controls are relative to _
the character herself; if she’s walking
toward you, left means right and right
means left. I can’t begin to describe how
much of a pain that is. Every other decent
ganie has the controls set relative to the
camera, so moving the joystick left means
that you move left. Further, the combat
system is absolutely terrifying. For some
reason, that twitching thing goes down
after one clip of bullets in a cut—scene, but.
later in the game you can empty two clips
into it at point blank range and enjoy an
inevitable death as it goes on clubbing

Some justify terrible controls in a hor-
ror game as adding to the frustration and
thus increasing tension. I think it’s just a
cop-out.

The graphics are decent enough, with

‘tolerable cut—scenes. The music, when it

exists, succeeds in setting a spooky mood.
Despite these facts, you’ll most likely be
blinded by rage and ‘deafened by the string
of laments issuing from your mouth
should you actually‘ purchase this game.
Rent it, try to enjoy it — if you dare — but

return it quickly lest it devour your soul.

Radiohead or Sigur Ros. Tons of spacey
reverb, electronic drums and soft vocals
carry this underrated “masterpiece
through its progressions. Originally, the
album was slated to be the last Elliott
journey, but thankfully, the band decid-
ed to do a farewell tour that already
went through Europe and now is on its
way through the States. .

If you’ve never heard Elliott
before, you really need to. False
Cathedrals stands as a testament for all
lovers of quality indie and emo —— not
the slit—your—wrists emo, but quality
stuff, a la American Football. This is
what good emo sounded like, back
when it first made headlines. Elliott

_ always pushed boundaries, using elec-
tronic as well as analog’ drums, pianos,

strings, guitars, bass and melodic
vocals. Guitar sounds, were light and
airy to complement the vocals.

It’s just so unfortunate that very
few know who they are, and that is why
it’s all the more important to go see
them on their ﬁnal tour.

If you miss this, make sure you at
least go get those two albums at bare
minimum. With‘ backing acts Drumkan,
who "appeared on a 2000 Pixies tribute
compilation, and Your Black Star, it
should be a wonderful little “last hur-
rah” for one of the finer bands to grace
the indie community. “

Panthers fall to OGBM Leen  

Helen Darlingscored 20 points on seven—for-ll
shooting in the Ohio Girls Basketball Magazine

Legends’ 64-61 exhibition win over the Pitt women’s‘

basketball team.

Darling, at point guard, led the Legends in three-
pointers with three baskets from behind the arc.

“Everything went through Darling,” Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said. “Darling brought the ball
up, Darling penetrated, she shot the gaps, Darling had
the attitude.” K

Pitt went into halftime with a 29-26 lead, but the
Legends came out strong with two unanswered three-
pointers from Darling in the second half.

“That’s where we lost the game,” Berenato said,
calling it the key. . .

Berenato credited Darling with not only great play,
but an entirely different mindset than the Panthers.

“It’s the mentality. You’ve got to have a winner’s
mentality,” Berenato said in reference to a play in
which Darling forced a foul from guard Amy Kunich.
“We don’t have anyone that’s willing to step up and do
that yet.”

Jessica Allen guarded Darling for the Panthers and
ﬁnished the game with three steals in 22 minutes.

 “[Her offense] didn’t shock me much because I
was told she’s a shooter,” Allen said. “If you’re not up
there with your hand in her face, she’s going to knock
it down.”

The Legends’ other top scorer, Larecha Jones, fm-
ished with 25 points and led her team with nine
rebounds.

“[J ones] has been shooting very erratic [recent1y],”

Berenato said. “So she was due.”

Center Allisha Monis’ led the Panthers in scoring
with 13 points in 29 minutes of play.

Pitt’s only other double-digit scorer was forward
Sheila Stufﬂet, who ﬁnished the game with 12 points.

“I think that [we] played totally different from
Midnight Madness,” Stufﬂet said. “[But] I think as
players, we’ve got tobe [more] aggressive.”

Both teams shot for 25 percent in three pointers,
but the Legends ﬁnished with four to the Panthers’
three. -

Pitt led the Legends in points in the paint and sec-

ond-chance ‘points but trailed in points off of
turnovers and free-throw percentages.

“You can’t shoot 50 percent from the free throw
line,” Berenato said. _

Pitt was six-for—l2 from behind the line.

Kunich led the Panthers in assists with six, but
finished with only four points.

Despite the loss, Berenato said she found many 9

positives in Pitt’s performance. .
“I’m very proud of the team,” Berenato said.

“We’ve been together two weeks. They’re not used to ‘

me, I’m not used to them. - .

“I didn’t even know if they would be able to run
a system.” .

The Panthers managed to initiate several offen-
sive packages, but missed lay-ups and free throws
plagued Pitt’s first half. .

“Unfortunately, we just didn’t ﬁnish,” Berenato
said. -

Allen added her positive spin to the disappoint-
ing season-opening loss, saying, “.We can look at this
as just a leaming tool and not let this loss get to us
too much.” ‘

Pitt gets ready for new season withfresh faces 9

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

It’s a new season for a new team in
Pitt wrestling.

The Panthers boast a young roster,
filling in for several injured and sus-
pended players in the 2003-2004 sea-
son.

“We’re [only] going to start one
senior, Josh Birt,” head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said, “and he’s only wres-
tled seven times for us.” ' '

Pitt will have to compensate for

the loss of numerous valuable gradu—'

ates, -namely last year’s Eastern
Wrestling League Wrestler of Year

Carl Fronhofer and NCAA
Championships qualifier Justin
p Giovinco.

“We’re certainly going to miss
those guys, but we do have talent-,”

 

Stottlemyer said. “We have some hors-
es.” ’

Among the Panthers, standouts-are,‘

sophomores Ronald Tarquinio. gthe
141-pound weight class and Justin

A Nestor in the 157-pound weight class,
who were NCAA Championships qual- ‘

iﬁers last season. »

“They both have worked extreme-
ly hard this summer,” Stottlemyer said.
“They’re ready to get it done.”

Stottlemyer also said sophomore
Francis Iorﬁdo would be strong in the
174-pound weight class.

Currently missing from Pitt’s line-
up are the injured 'I‘yshawn Scarlet and
Zachariah Doll. ’ -

“We’re a little banged up, [but]
we'll just be patient” Stottlemyer said.
“We want them, atthe end of the year,

I tobe healthy.”

Adding to the team’s roster woes

are several suspended players. Jordan
Sianni, Michael Perinotti, Mike Ciotti

and Jim Mangan have been suspended

for the fall term for violating an undis-
closed team rule.

Robert Kail is ineligible for acade-
mic reasons. ‘ ’ '

The Panthers will first be in action
at the Michigan State Classic, Nov. 8
and 9.

Pitt’s dual meet season opens on
Nov. 19 against the No. 2 wrestling
team in the nation, Lehigh.

“Our schedule is always tough,”
Stottlemyer said. “We’ll see ‘most of

' the top 25 teams in the country.”

The regular season concludes for
the Panthers with six straight in-con-

-fefence meets, leading up to the
‘Eastern
Championships in Bloomsburg, Pa.

Wrestling League

Last year, Pitt placed ﬁfth in the

-~...

Edinboro, West‘ Virginia, Cleveland

Panthers look totake advantage of Hokies’ secondary

RYAN FLEMING
Staff Writing

Much attention has been aimed at Pitt football this .

week, and for good reason —— a Big East conference
championship is perhaps on the line.

The 25th ranked Panthers (6-2, 3-0) look to hold
their top spot in the_ conference this weekend as they
host No. 5 Virginia Tech Saturday. _

The Hokies.(7-1, 3-1) are fresh off a big upset over
Miami and will be looking to seek revenge after losing
to the Panthers in their previous two meetings. A

It is expected to be one of the ‘premier matchups of

, the season, and with ESPN ’s.College GameDay crew
on hand to televise the game nationally and a standing— .

room-only, sellout crowd, Pitt will have the chance to
prove itself to the entire country. The Panthers will
have their hands full, however, and "a lot of things to
worry about as they face Virginia Tech. "

Hokies star running back, Kevin Jones, will per-
haps pose the biggest threat to. the Panther defense.

Jones, who has rushed for 863 yards thus far this
season, averaging 5.5 yards per carry, runs an incredi-
ble 4.3 seconds in the 40-yarddash. With 10 touch-
downs already on the season, he has remained a major

contender for this year’s Heisman Trophy.
“He’s fast and an all-around great player,” Pitt

. head coach Walt Harris said. “I don’t think we have

anyone who runs that fast.”

Though the quarterback situation has been shaky
throughout the season for Virginia Tech, head coach
Frank Beamer has announced that junior Bryan
Randall will start over redshirt freshman~Marcus Vick.
Beamer said, however, that Vick will receive playing
time. 1 A A

Defensively, the Hokies have a star as well, but
only for half of the game. DeAnge1o Hall, the team’s
top comerback and punt returner, has been a standout
all season. A

- However, after altercations between Hall and
Miarni’s Antrel Rolle in the closing minutes of last
week’s contest, the Big East conference has suspended
Hall for the first half of this week’s game.

The absence of Hall should create a big opening
for Pitt to put up some early points with its high-pow-
ered offense that excels in the passing game. The
Virginia Tech secondary will most likely have its hands
full with the Panthers star receiver, Larry Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald, also a serious contender for the

-Heisman Trophy, has appeared ﬂawless thus far and

has been nearly impossible to defend. He is tops in the
country in receiving yards per game (146.8), touch-.
downs (16) and total receiving yards (1,174).

“When the ball is in the air, it is his,” Harris said.
“We just have to get him the ball.”

As for the Panthers running game, it remains ques-
tionable. Though Jawan Walker has ﬁlled in nicely at
running back for the injured Brandon Miree, Pitt’s
rushing yards have been hard to come by.

Virginia Tech has allowed an average of 114.1
rushing yards per game, however, which could create a
big opportunity for Walker to have a big night. He’s
coming off of a big game against Boston College in
which he had a receiving and a rushing touchdown, and
threw a touchdown pass to Fitzgerald.

To get past the Hokies, the Panthers must have a
complete offensiveday, spreading out the pass and the
run. Defensively, they simply must stop the run and
adjust to the changing quarterbacks.

Saturday appears to be a bit of a challenge for both 4

teams, but with a sellout crowd at home on ESPN, the
Panthers have a lot going for them and have a major
opportunity to turn their season up a notch.

The game will take place at Heinz Field Saturday,
and kickoff is scheduled for 7:45 p.m.

N ov. 3, 2001: Panthers stun Hokies to turn dismal season around

Editor’s note: This is the , ninth in a
“Greatest Games ” series that will appear
in The'Pitt'News the day before each Pitt
footballgame this year: Each part in the
series will detail Pitt’s greatest game

. against that weeks opponent and will con-

tain the original game story as it appeared
in The Pitt News. This story was written by
Shaun Griﬂin on Nov. 5, 2001.

Pitt beat No. 12 Virginia Tech 38-7 at

Heinz Field on Saturday.
No tricks here, Halloween is over.
But maybe Pitt left its costumes on,
because it looked like the same team that
beat a dismal Temple squad 33-7 a week
before. It looked like the team that every-
one thought it would be at the beginning
of the season. '
’ According to head coach Walt Harris,

‘Pitt looked like "the Virginia Tech team it

expected to face this weekend.
“They play great defense,” said Harris

of the Hokies, a team a week removed "

from a top ﬁve position in the national
rankings but‘ who’ve now lost consecutive
games for the ﬁrst time since 1997. “They
play tremendous special teams, and they
run the ball on offense. The only‘ differ-
ence between them and us is we’re proba-
bly going to always. throw the ball pretty
well.” ‘

Except for a blocked ﬁeld goal, which
Hokies defensive back Ronyell Whitaker
returned 71 yards for Virginia Tech’s only
touchdown, Pitt was all those things

' against a big-time opponent for one

Saturday in what so far has been a disap-
pointing season. .

The defense held the volatile Hokies
olfense to 151 yards total and only 15

‘ more of the thingsrthat

yards rushing. The Pitt offense had a pass-
ﬁrst mentality against the nation’s top-
ranked defense and
came away with 245
passing yards. But then
the rushing offense
picked. up in the second
half, and Pitt finished
with 148 yards on the
ground.
“We

   

ﬁnally did

we needed to do to be
successful,” Harris said.
After going three

blocked and returned for a touchdown,
seemingly shifting the momentum back to
Virginia Tech. Pitt had-
n’t been able to shift it
back in any game so far
this season.

“Our biggest
thing was overcoming
the adversity," and today
we took a step forward
in doing that,” said
Bryant, who finished
with ﬁve catches for 93
yards and two touch-
downs.

plete to‘Antonio Bryant,
but pass interference
was called on the
defense. On the -very
next play, Priestley
threw’ 24 yards to
Bryant over the middle
for a touchdown.
Virginia Tech was
called for 11 penalties, and it cost them
120 yards. . ‘
“Antonio made a great catch early ...
and that got me going,” said Priestley,
whose play has been under constant
scrutiny this season.
. Later in the ﬁrst quarter, Priestley
threw to Bryant, who was again interfered

~ up for a 34-yard ﬁeld goal. The kick was

pass for a score, putting

‘ Pitt up 14-7.
The defense
couldn’t contain

English, who mostly
caught short passes and
turned them into long
gains by lowering his
head and straightening
his arm into the smaller defensive backs.
English ﬁnished with eight catches for 134
yards plus the touchdown.

“They quit today. We made them
quit,” English said of the Hokies. ‘They

' wanted to get the hell out of here.”

After a Lotz ﬁeld goal, the defense,
which harassed Hokies quarterback Grant
Noel throughout the game, sacked Noel
on the ensuing set of downs and he fum-

bled. Pitt recovered and capitalized when
Bryant caught a 36-yard pass from
Priestley for his second touchdown of the
game.

The score stood at 24-7 at halftime,

and it just got worse for the Hokies from

there.

Noel connected with Pitt defensive
back Shawntae Spencer, who ran 68 yards
in the opposite direction to give Pitt a 31-
7 advantage. Quarterback Rod Rutherford

V padded the blowout by keeping the ball

and running into the end zone with about
four minutes left in the game.
After the game, Harris praised

Priestley, who completed 16 of 26 passes ’

for three touchdowns and no interceptions.
“I think it’s his best performance ever
as a player because he won against a
ranked team. He ﬁnally beat a team that no
one in here thought he couldibeat,” Harris
said.
Priestley thanked the guys blocking
for him. -
“The biggest thing that has to be rec-

ognized today is our offensive line. I don’t‘

think I got sacked once, and ifI did, it was
my fault. I can only remember getting hit
one time,” Priestley said.

Harris also wasn’t afraid to comment
on the simpliﬁed offense Pitt has run’ in the
last two games, perhaps reason Pitt is still
in bowl contention with three games to
play.

“I think changing [the offense]
might’ ve helped us, obviously, and I’m
not too proud to say that it has helped us,”
Harris said. “It gives our players a little
more time to know the play, and it gives
our quarterback a little bit more time to
know the coverage.”

Wrestling 101: What exactly is a pin and how is one executed?

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

For wrestling fans that plan to venture
up to Fitzgerald Field House this season to
watch Pitt’s wrestling team and expect to
see a NCAA wrestling version of WWF
Smackdown! you will be very disappointed.

Wrestling matches in college are a lot
different than the professional wrestling
matches seen on television. In NCAA
wrestling, there are actual rules, and teams
attempttoarnassasmanyteampointsas
possible in order to win the meet

NCAA wrestling features 10 head-to-
head match-ups between opponents in the
same weight classes. Both teams have to ﬁll

each weight class otherwise it is considered
a forfeit, which is worth six team points.
The weight classes are 125, 133, 141, 149,

.157, 165, 174, 184, 197 and heavyweight

Each match is three periods unless there
is a pin, technical fall or overtime. Period
one is three minutes long and periods two
and three are two minutes long.

The order in which the wrestlers wres-
tle varies from meet to meet, so one meet

could begin at the 125—pound weight class

while the next could begin with the heavy-
weight bout.

Once the meet begins, each team sends .

out its wrestler for the corresponding weight
class. At the beginning of the ﬁrst period, the
wrestlers line up in the center of the

wrestling mat in what is called the neutral
position.

The goal is for one wrestler to take the
other wrestler down. The two basic -take-
downs that are used are single— and double-
leg takedowns. A wrestler is awarded two
points for a takedown.

A single-leg takedown is when a
wrestler is able wrap up one of his oppo-
nents’ legs to take him to the mat and vice
versa for a double-leg takedown. If neither
wrestler is able to secure a takedown at the
end of the three minutes then the score
remains (H) and the second period begins.

Other than the neutral position, there
are three different positions that wrestlers
can begin from during the second and third

periods. A wrestler can begin on the bottom
while the opposing wrestler is lined up over
his back with one hand on the elbow and
one half way around the waist Or the
wrestler can choose the top position in
which the opponent would end up on the
bottom '

During one of the last two periods, each
wrestler will have the choice of deciding
which position they want This is deter-
mined before the match as the captains meet
for a coin toss. Whatever team wins the toss
has the choice of odd or even.

If they choose, even this means that
they get the choice in the second period for
even weight classes, which are weight class-
es 133, 149, 165, 184 and heavyweight. If
the team chooses odd they - get choice in the
second period for weight classes 125, 141,
157, 174 and 197. —

Wrestlers have the choice of deferring
their choice to the third period and forcing
their opponent to choose a position in the
second period ’

There are two ways to score from the
bottom position. A wrestler‘ can escape,
which is worth one point This can be
accomplished by standing up, getting away
from their opponent and then turning
around and facing their opponent. The other
method of scoring is known as a reversal, in
which a wrestler reverses the opponent to

the bottom position and ends up on top. A i

reversal is worth two points. _

’ There are only two ways to score from
the top position.-The most common is to
gain back points. The wrestler on top must
use a legal method of exposing his oppo-
nents back at a 45-degree angle. When this
is accomplished, the referee will begin to
count The wrestler is awarded two near—fall
points if the referee gives at least a two
count, but does not make it to ﬁve. Ifthe ref-
eree gives a ﬁve count, the wrestler is then
awarded three near fall points.

The ﬁnal way to score from the top is '

when a wresﬂer is given one point for riding
time. This is given at the end of the bout to
the wrestler that spent the most time in the
top position. - ‘

Wrestlers can also be awarded avpenal-
ty point if the top wresﬂer locks his hands
around the bottom wrestlers’ waist while his
hands are still touching the mat. . _

_Each individual bout contributes to a
team score, and whoever has the most team
points at the end of the match the winner.

Wrestlers are awarded three points for a.

decision, which is a victory by less than
eight points. —

_ A victory by major decision, which is
winning by eight points but no more than 14
points, earns a team four points.» Teams can
earn ﬁve points if their wrestler wins by$a~
technical fall, which is winning by 15 points

or more. When this occurs, the match is .

stopped regardless of if time has expired.
Finally there is the fall or. pin. A wrestler

must pin down their opponents’ shoulder

blades for two consecutive seconds. Ifthis is

accomplished the team is awarded. six '

points.
