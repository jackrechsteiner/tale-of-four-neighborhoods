Frosh credentials andapplications soar 5

' DAVE HARTMAN
Assistant-News Editor _

All the indicators seem to point 

A the same conclusion: Pitt keeps getting

better.

Today, the University is in a whir:l- I
A wind of increased freshman applications,

increased standards for admission, and
increased budgets, spending and total
assets. V '

One of three state—aﬂiliated educa-
tional institutions in Pennsylvania, Pitt is
two—thirds of the way through a six-year‘
ftmd-raising campaign that has’ been
dubbed the most successfulfund-raiser
in Western Pem1sylvania’s history.

And according to Pitt Chancellor

I Mark Nordenberg, whose six years as

chancellor have been ﬁnancially and
academically successful ones for the
University, it’s bound to keep getting bet-
ter.

In the last six years, thenumber of
freshman applications has nearly dou-
bled, from 7,825 in 1995 to 15,410 in
2001. In line with that increase, the
University has become increasingly
selective during thos‘e years. In 1995,
more than 79 percent of freshman appli-

cants were accepted, while last year that"
number stood at 59.7 percent.
But the University isn’t only boast-

' ing _its increasing academic selectivity.

Pitt’s annual budget reachedi$l.l3 bil-
lion last year, almostl 1/2 times what it
was in 1995. With an endowment_ almost
as large —— it now stands at $1.12 billion‘
— the snowballing effect of Pitt’s rapid
ﬁnancial gains is now in full swing.
Pitt’s total assets, a mere $1.495 bil-

lion in 1995, have grown by 83.6 percent ,

to $2.764 billion, and the University’s
capital campaign continues to yield
donations, more than 80 of which have
been in excess of $1 millioneach.

Among the larger contributions is
the $10 million pledge from Pitt alurrmus
John Petersen, in exchange for Pitt’s‘
decision to" name the new convocation
center the John M. and Gertrude E.
Petersen Events Center. 4

Many of the contributions came -
as the Petersen donation did — with spe-
ciﬁc instructions for the money’s use.
The $800,000 gifted to Pitt by James
McCarl ll], a 1973 Pitt alum, will be
used to ftmd the McCarl Center for
Nontraditional Student Success in Pitt’s
College of General Studies.

Likewise, the $5 million pledged by
the late Dorothy P. Simmons‘ and former
Pitt trustee Richard P. Simmons will be
used to create the Dorothy P. and Richard
P. Simmons Chair for Pulmonary
Research, as well as a center for research
and education in interstitial lung disease,
boﬂi in Pitt’s’ School of -Medicine.

In a June press release, Pitt outlined
its goals in the ftmd-raising campaign as
“dramatically increasing [its] endow-
ment, enhancing the campus’ physical
facilities, and adding signiﬁcantly to the
institution’s program support.”

According to the University’s analy-
sis of the donations, 32 percent‘ come

from individuals, 42 percent from private .

A foundations, 15 percent from corpora-
tions and 12 percent from other organi-
zational entities. . 0 ' -

Nordenberg reﬂected on the
University’s rapid improvements in the
lastgsix years, saying that “even higher
levels of quality are within our reac .”

“As we look at the University

‘today,” Nordenberg said, “We see an
institution characterized by enviable
achievement, by rapidly accelerating
momentum and by almost boundless
opportunity.”

Pitt police work while students vacation

CHARLOTTE TUCKER
‘ News Editor

Just because many Pitt students
head home for the summer doesn’t
mean the Pitt police can spend their
days lounging poolside.

Nay, all 71 officers on the force
are kept busy with the constant bar-
rage of calls about incidents on cam-
pus, some criminal, others not so
criminal.

Theft is the biggest problem on
campus. ‘An unofficial Pitt News
review of crime during the months of
May, June and July indicated that
there were 64 incidents of

theft,including 12 bike thefts.

According to Pitt police Chief
Tim Delaney, bike thefts are com-
mon in the summer months because
large numbers of students and staff
utilize their bikes during that time
and many don’t secure them proper-
ly. Delaney recommends that riders
use a U-Bolt rather than the less
expensive cable locks that can be
more easily cut.

Delaney said other types of theft
are common because people are
often distracted by schoolwork or
other activities and don’t concentrate
on basic crime prevention tech-
niques.

But more than any other call this
summer, the Pitt police responded to
false alarms.

In May, June and July, police

logged- 96 burglar and fire alarms,»

six of which turned out to be gen-
uine. '

According to Delaney, many fac-
tors can activate the alarms: toast
burning, ductwork cleaning, and
“children playing with the pretty red
boxes,” among others.

He said that despite the high vol-
ume of false calls, officers treat
every alarm like a real one.

When a fire_ alarm goes off, at
least three. officers respond. One

responds to the fire panel that reads
the location of the alarm in the build-
ing, one checks to see if there are any
handicapped people in the building
and one meets the fire department in
a previously agreed upon location.
Other officers help with evacuation
and traffic control if necessary.

on .a slightly less dramatic front,
Pitt police officers also respond to

elevator entrapments, of which our

campus has a fair number.
An" unofficial tally of entrapment

calls during the first three months of '

summer yielded 24 elevator entrap-
ments involving at least 38 people.
While no single building hosted
an overwhelming number of the
entrapments, the Cathedral of
Learning, Litchfield Towers and
Bellefield Towers led the field.

According to Laura Zullo, the I

manager of equipment preservation

in the facilities management depart- «

ment, the elevator problems are to be
expected. ’

“[EleVators are] like any other
kind of mechanical equipment,” she
said. “You’re going to have some
failures.”

But Zullo stressed that the
department‘ takes the elevator entrap-
ments seriously. There is even a
clause in the contracts of repair
workers that they must respond
quickly to any entrapment calls.

Zullo said that facilities manage-
ment is making an effort to replace
or repair elevators that continually
have problems. One of her first pri-
orities was the elevators in the

>Wi11iam Pitt Union, which were .
replaced this summer. Next, she said,

she wants to see work done on
Benedum Hall. 9
Finally, the Pitt police make a
fair number of arrests and issue a
number of citations during the sum-
mer,- but inmost instances Pitt stu-

dents are not the ones apprehended. —

In the first three months. of sum-
mer, Pitt police arrested 27 people on

charges ranging from drug posses--

sion to trespassing, but none of those
people were affiliated with the
University. I __

The police also cited 26 people
on lesser charges, including under-
age drinking. In those instances, only
four people were University affili-
ates.

Why are so many people who
have little to do with Pitt arrested
and cited by our officers? Because,
according to Delaney, the
University’s location draws many
outsiders into Oakland.

“Oakland is on the cutting edge
of our city,” he said. “If something
is new or from out of town, you’ll
see it first in Oakland.”

C Association warmly welcome our Freshman men to the long history of those who

Shuttle system re

CHARLOTTE TUCKER
News Editor

In response to hundreds of stu-
dent surveys regarding where, when
and how often, Pitt’s department of
parking, transportation and services
revamped the shuttle bus system.

In keeping with the Port
Authority’s system of numbering
routes, the department renamed the
routes that shuttles take.

The ‘department is doing away
with the former names of the shut-
tles, such as Sutherland Express,
Campus Shuttle and South Oakland
Shuttle, and replacing those names

with numbers and letters followed
by street names.

Gerald Kvortek, the transporta-
tion manager for the department,
said the changes are part of an
attempt to spread out ridership
among the shuttles, particularly the
ones that go up the hill. ‘

Kvortek said students wanting
to get to Sutherland Hall often felt

compelled to wait for the
Sutherland Express rather than
catching the Campus Shuttle,

despite the fact that the two trav-
eled virtually the same route.

Now, under the new system, all

The big stories you missed

The Beehive shuts its doors for good 6.8 that Proved impossibly 

With no warning even
employees were left clueless —— the
Beehive theater and coffeehouse on
Forbes Avenue closed its doors on
the night of May 14.

According to co—owner Steve
Zumoff, the Beehive has no plans to
reopen the restaurant, bar and music
venue at its Oakland location.

Mark Choi, an employee there
since 1992, said the decision to
close the Beehive stemmed from

problems between Beehive owners
Zumoff and Scott Kramer, and the
company that owns the building,
Oakland Real Estate.

According to Choi, the two par-
ties had been negotiating a lease for
eight months before the bar’s clos-
ing. Choi said Beehive owners had
reached a verbal agreement with the
leasing company, but that when the
lease was presented to the Beehive,
it included substantial rent increas-

A day after the Beehive closed
its doors, uniquely clad protesters
waved signs and chanted —— quietly,
at the request of police in the area
— in front of Oakland Real Estate
on Oakland Avenue.

Sabrina Nelson, who prefers to
be known as “The Ubiquitress,”
could barely be heard as she softly
chanted in protest of the real estate
company. Nelson, who said she
recently moved from New York to
Pittsburgh “because of the art

scene” here, said she was protesting
to let people know the importance
of mid—size concert venues such as
the Beehive.

, “People don’t have anywhere to
grow from,” she said.
Christina Springer, a co-founder of
the non-profit arts group Sun
Crumbs, said the Beehive’s closirig
was the result of unfair business
practices, and that it’s impact was
an unfortunate one.

According to Springer, the
Beehive attracted and maintained a
youthful base in the Pittsburgh
community.

“Without that young demo-
graphic, a city dies,” she said.

SGB oversight
causes chaos

An oversight in the changes
made to Student Government
Board’s constitution after a referen-
dum last fall has led to complica-
tions regarding the date that the
new board should take office.

Jeff Alex and the eight members
of the 2002 board were elected
April 11, but according to the con-
stitution, President Mike Unangst’s
2001 board officially holds office
until the beginning of January.
While the bylaws of the constitu-
tion were changed in light of the
‘referendum, the constitution itself
was not, creating a bit of a mess.

While members of both boards
seem to agree that the failure to
change the dates in both documents
is a technical oversight, an air of
confusion pervades the issue of the
transition of power. '

According to former board
member Jay Dworin, the constitu-
tional oversight was called to the
attention of the 2001 board two
weeks before the close of the school
year. Dworin said Unangst told the
board that he would consult ‘With a
parliamentarian and that the board
would continue to meet after the
school year ended to wrap up busi-
ness and decide what to do about
the error; -

On May 1, Unangst sent a letter
to members of his board and the
April electees. In it he said that it
was the will of the students that
Alex’s board take office, and he
stated ‘his intention to swear Alex
into office that day.

Police recover
Hayduk’s body
near Morgantown

The body of Pitt freshman Justin

Hayduk, who had been missing for‘

more than two months, was found in
the Monongahela River on May 22.
According to the Morgantown,
W.Va., police, the Chambersburg
native’s body was found in
Granville, W. Va., a town four miles
west of Morgantown, where police
initially focused their search.
Hayduk was last seen at about 2
a.m. on March 10, visiting friends at
West Virginia University during

‘Pitt’s spring break. According to

police, he was approached by
Morgantown police officers as he
pretended to fight with a friend,
Chris Kille. Kille was questioned by
the officers and cited for public
intoxication, but Hayduk ran from
the police.

After his disappearance, detec-
tives, dogs and divers searched for
the missing teen-ager as his friends
and family traveled to and from
Morgantown in hopes that they
could help the investigation.
Hayduk’s friends and fraternity
brothers passed out more than 1,000
ﬂiers with Haydukis picture and the
phone number for the Morgantown
police. .

Police ended the river search for
Hayduk last month, but his parents

maintained hope, creating a Web
site where friends and strangers

' alike posted messages.

And then at about 9 a.m. on May
22, workers on a Consolidated Coal
Co. tugboat in Granville spotted a
body. Police have not yet ruled out
foul play, but they theorize that
Hayduk simply fell into the river.

Pitt explores
same sex benefits

After more than five years of lit-
igation between Pitt and the
American Civil Liberties Union, all
lawsuits were put on hold in May
when the University announced that
it would form a committee to deter-
mine whether Pitt should extend
employment benefits to the same-
sex partners of University employ-
ees. .
The Pittsburgh chapter of the
ACLU represents seven current and

‘ former employees to whom the

University has refused to extend
same-sex partner benefits. Its class
action suit seeks damages on behalf
of gay and lesbian Pitt employees.
But according» to Vic Walczak,
director of the group’s Pittsburgh
chapter, the suit’s higher purpose is
to foster policy change. A
Walczak called the committee’s
formation a step in the right direc-

.tion. “We’re pleased that they’ve

agreed to even consider [extending

, benefits],” he said. ‘

Other nearby universities, such

as Carnegie Mellon University, have V

already extended benefits, some-
thing that Walczak said is becoming
increasingly common. K

In the past, Pitt refused to
extend benefits based on the possi-

bility of losing funding from state

legislators who could jeopardize the
state-related school’s budget if it
decided to extend benefits.

In 1999, the state passed legisla-
tion that exempted state -and state-
related universities from adhering to
local ordinances regarding the
extension of benefits. The legisla-
tion boosted Pitt’s position against
the ACLU because it prevented the
city’s ordinance on same-sex bene-
fits from applying to Pitt.

According to the ACLU,’ the leg-
islation was “aimed at derailing the
ACLU lawsuit,” ‘and\ according to
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, that
legislation may have been prompted
by at least one high-ranking Pitt
official. . . '

The Post-Gazette reported that
Executive Vice Chancellor Jerome
Cochran received a faxed copy of
the proposed legislation on Nov. 5,
1999. The fax was sent from an
unknown source in Harrisburg, Pa.,
but it prompted the ACLU to con-
tend that the University “conspired
with the Pennsylvania legislature to
violate plaintiff’s constitutional
rights by passing the statute to deny
lesbians and gay men equal protec-
tion of the law.”

The. ACLU maintains that Pitt’s
refusal. to extend benefits is partly
fueled by some members of the
Board of Trustees who have
“expressed hostility toward lesbians
and gay men as well as concern that

the provisions of same-sex domestic
partner benefits "would harm
University fund—raising efforts.”

In a 1999 sworn deposition,
then-trustee chair J.W. Connolly
said he would have a problem with
gays being employed as child-care
workers. a

According to a University press‘

release, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg appointed the commit-
tee that will assess the feasibility of
offering benefits. That committee
will be made up of faculty, adminis-
trators, staff, students, alumni and
trustees.

Pitt said the investigation will
provide “a full‘ and impartial explo-
ration of the ramifications and
implications of the policy options
available to the University.”

The University also praised
those involved in the lawsuit, saying
that the moratorium on the litigation
establishes a climate that “permits
the University an appropriate exam-
ination of the issues involved.”

which kitchen worker Jerome
Johnson sliced off the tip of his
right index finger. Silverman paid
the hospital bills associated with
Johnson’s accident, but a discrepan-
cy in the paperwork led to the inves-
tigation.

According to an affidavit filed
with District Justice John T. Bender,
Anna Geyer of the Bureau of
Workers’ Compensation found that
when Johnson was injured
Silverman was conducting business

without workers’ compensation, a ’

felony under the Pennsylvania
Workers’ Compensation Act.

Geyer’s probe further revealed «

that Silverman was without the
insurance for a total of 944 days
between January 1997 and February
200_1, resulting in the 944 felony
charges against him. .

According to the affidavit,
Geyer’s report said Silverman
would obtain the insurance for a
period of time, cancel, and then
obtain coverage again. The affi-
davit lists three companies from
which Silverman obtained coverage
a total of five times, and in each
instance the policy was cancelled
for non—payment of premiums.

Silverman could not be reached

Tuition hike 7.5

percent —-— largest

in 13 years

Pitt’s Board of Trustees Voted in
June to raise tuition 7.5 percent for
the coming year.

According to University
spokesman Robert Hill, the tuition

, hike is in response to lower-than-

expected funding from the state.
Hill said the University hoped for a
5 to 6 percent increase in common-
wealth funding from last year’s
appropriations, but the increase
turned out‘ to be only 1.2 percent.
“What were committed to is

improving the quality of the
University of Pittsburgh,” Hill said.
He added that because the

University is increasing staff and
faculty, compensation and financial
aid as well as a $1 million increase
in student life and academic pro-
grams, the hike was necessary.

“We needed to raise the tuition
to compensate for the allocation of
the commonwealth being lower than
we hoped for,” he said.

i A 7.5 percent tuition hike trans-
lates to an increase of $480 per year
for in-state students and $1,056 for
out-of-state College of Arts and

Pitt and PAT
renew contract

Port Authority Transit and the
University announced on July 20
that they had renegotiated a contract
granting Pitt students, faculty and
staff a free ride on all PAT buses,
inclines and subways.

The $2.28 million deal is paid
for through Pitt’s $55 per student,
per semester transportation fee.
According to Pitt spokesman Ron
Chicowicz, that fee will stay the
same even after the $380,000
increase to last year’s amount.

THE PITT NEWS

The increase, brought about.

because of a 20 percent'across—the-
board fare increase instituted by
PAT in April, still doesn’t bring the
contract’s amount to where PAT
would like it. Beginning next year,
the contract will cost Pitt $2.52 mil-
lion to account for increased Pitt
ridership figures.

But with PAT providing nearly
450,000 rides to Pitt affiliates per
month, at a cost of approximately 35
cents per ride, authority spokesman
Bob Grove contends that the
University is still getting a great
deal. According to Grove, the deal
isn’t designed as a moneymaking
venture at all. Rather, PAT considers
it an investment in the future.

“We think the value in this is
exposing a large number of younger

people - to public transportation,”
Grove said, adding that PAT is a
non-profit government-funded insti-
tution that generates only about half
of its revenue from fares.

pus: improvement process also works in
much humbler areas, such as the class-
rooms andwaesthetics of the University.

V ‘»-‘We started, about six years ago, a
classroom improvement project on which
we‘ spend about $115 million every year,”
Pack said- ’  '

t The -ﬁrst step; taken each year is
improvements to_ the lmgglectme halls in
which introductory  are typically
taught. i t . ; "

‘,‘[This year] in the large lecture halls
we’ will put in computer [and] net-
work ports, so the faculty can bring in a
laptop and work directly from that. There
will be a projection system built into [the
lecture hall] — there will be full [audio-
visual] -support,” Pack said. “You could
show overheads, VCR [projections], and
they can project computer images as well
as video images.”

After the larger classrooms have been
outﬁtted, the new technology “ will be

.. installed in the smaller rooms.

Once inside the buildings, it is clear
that they are a part of the Pitt campus. But

' . from the outside it can be hard to differ-

entiate Pitt from the rest of Pittsburgh.
_‘_ Pack said Pitt is beginning to address
this problem, and has begun work on pro-

. jects designed to let students know exact-

ly where Pitt’s Oakland campus lies.
“What the University has tried to do

_ is present a greater sense of campus,”
’ Pack said. “When you’re an urban school,

obviously it’s hard not to just have every-
thing just sort of blend together.”
Pack said the Unive_rsity’s solution

' has been to mark the geography of the

campus “so that the students and every-

body else knows when they are on the

University of Pittsburgh campus.”
Toward this goal, the University

hung banners around campus and built

two stone semi—walls bearing the seal of

 the [University on the Cathedral of

Learning lawn at either end of South
Belleﬁeld Avenue.
“We are such a signiﬁcant part of

[Pittsburgh] that we really wanted to

EDITORIAL  

Pitt pride is it 

It’s back to school time again. And
this year, we are returning to an even’ bet-

ter Pitt. Step your Pitt pride up a notch’

and be wowed by Pitt’s new staggering
stats.

Freshman applications have nearly
doubled -— a 97 percent increase in the

last six years. In 1995, Pitt’s acceptance ,
rate was 79 percent. Now, it’s 59.7 per- a

cent. '

In addition to attracting more
prospective students, Pitt has also been
successful in increasing its cash ﬂow.
The $500 Million Fund-Raising
Campaign, which commenced last fall,
had raised an amazingt$411,667,495 as
of June 28. ' 4

With this money has come 345

named endowments supporting scholar-
ships, fellowships, student resource frmds
and professorships promising toimprove
the quality of education found here.

But lest we get too excited about
Pitt’s improvements, we remain con-
cerned about problems, that are still
unsolved. Consider some events of the
summer. After just one year in office,
dean of students Sharon Johnson
resigned from the position and movedto

a less visible one in the School of-

Education. Pitt had trumpeted her arrival
to the position that coordinates the Oﬂice
of Student Affairs, an umbrella organiza-
tion for Student Health Services, Pitt

ment, aswell as other groups and organi-
zations. Pitt’s lack of explanation for

'Johnson’s‘ resignation should cause

alarm, considering Johnson’s inﬂuence
over these important programs.

Other negative summer events
included the 7.5 percent tuition hike and
the naming of the Connolly Ballroom
after the homophobic former Pitt Board

of -Trustees chairman J. Wray Connolly. V

Connolly had stated in a deposition that

' he would be concerned about homosexu-

al day-care workers, unless he could be
sure they wouldn’t attempt to encourage
children to lead a gay lifestyle.

. Recentchanges in Pitt’s policies and A

procedures show us that uniﬁed student
action can create results. Consider
Student Government Board’s movements

and rallies against racial proﬁling. Pitt’
' administrators condemned and promised

to create policies prohibiting the practice.

Over the summer, also as a result of
campus activism, Student Health ﬁnally
produced a coherent policy on emer-
gency contraceptives to allow for pre-
scription upon request. ‘

So let these student successes be les-
son one of the new school year. While we
should be proud of our ever-irnproving
Pitt community, we should never let our
guard down and always work for

progress. '

or is it?

Publishing more than just“Opinions”

' DAVID MCKENZIE AND MEGAN SMITH

Perspectives Editors

Over the summer months, while
you were probably out doing the sum-
mer job thing or visiting the shore,
we’ve been slaving away at The Pitt
News. OK, so maybe we haven’t been
exactly slaving. But we have been
shaking things up since summer pro-
duction began in May.

-So let us fill you in on the happen-
ings on the fourth ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union (more commonly known as
The Pitt News offices).

You’ve probably already noticed
our name change. Yeah, see it up
there? We’re not the “Opinions” any-
more. We’re the “Perspectives sec-
tion” now, because we represent the
impressions, thoughts, amusements,
lifestyles (and so on) of Pitt students
-— not just opinions.

But that’s only the beginning.
Probably the most dramatic change
we’ve made is to our hiring and pub-
lishing procedures. If you’re familiar
with the former Opinions section, then
you’re familiar with our system (or
lack thereof) of selecting works for
publication. In past years, we simply
published whatever was sent to us,
assuming it was reasonably quality

work and we had space. It was a sys-
tem with no guarantees -— we never
knew what content we would have to
print or even if anyone would choose
to write. Some weeks there would be
mountains of timely content and dur-
ing rnidterms, the big zilch.

But not anymore.

This year we are establishing “The
Opinionated Twelve.” (Snappy, ain’t
it?) These writers will be an elite
group of carefully screened weekly
columnists who will provide the
majority of content for the semester.
The two other daily college newspa-
pers in Pennsylvania, The Daily
Collegian (Penn State) and The Daily
Pennsylvanian (Penn) already have
similar systems of selecting official
columnists.

So how does one become of The
Opinionated Twelve, and what will
make this group so special? For
starters, these writers will be selected
through an application process. The

_ application requires a letter of intent, a

list of column ideas and two to three
sample columns. Applications are
available now in The Pitt News offices
or online at www.pittnews.com and
must be returned in paper form to the
Perspectives Desk at The Pitt News
offices by Sept. 4 at 9 p.m.

pie new Perspectives desk" is currently accepting applications for its
'‘ twelve weekly columnists.

 more information, please contact Dave or Megan at‘648-7984, or
via email at pittnews@pitt.edu.

Now why would anyone go to all
that trouble? Try thinking about it this
way: Every day 14,000 people. read
The Pitt News. That’s 14,000 readers
to impress, persuade or amuse. And if
you’re one of those 12, you’ll be
someone they look for every week.

After a while, people will start
thinking~to themselves, “Mental note:
I need to get a Pitt News today.‘ [Insert
your name here]’s column will be in
it!” _

Not only will they recognize your
name, but they will also recognize
your face because it too will be
appearing weekly as a part of your
byline.

And what’s more, people who
work for The Pitt News move on to
high places. Stephanie Huszar, a for-

'mer Pitt Newser and ‘99 grad, is cur-

rently a beauty editor at Cosmo Girl.
Another former Pitt Newser, Scott
MacLeod, is now a foreign correspon-
dent for Time.

Just think of where you can go —
The Pitt News can get you started. As
one of the 12, your resume will glow.
By being a member of the Perspectives
staff, you’ll have demonstrated dedi-

cation and the ability to meet a dead-

line, as well as communication, orga-
nizational and many other skills.

» Once we receive all the applica-
tions, we, the Perspectives Editors, in
conjunction with Editor in Chief
Shannon‘ McLaughlin and Managing
Editor Elizabeth Bowen (a former
Opinions Editor), will select the best‘

12, keeping an emphasis on-diversity,

of perspectives and ideas. so

We encourage all students to
apply. You don’t have to be an English
writing major or want to be a joumal-
ist to work -at The Pitt News. Among
the editors, we, have a variety of
majors and career goals. For example,
the copy desk editor is an engineering
major.

‘ Think about it this way: The Pitt
News is the independent student news-
paper of the University of Pittsburgh.
It should represent all Pitt students.

“The Opinionated Twelve” will be
posted Friday, Sept. 7 by 5 p.m. at The
Pitt News offices and the list will be
published in the Monday, Sept. 10 edi-
tion. There will also be an organiza-
tional meeting for the 12 at 8:30 p.m.
that Monday.

Once selected, these writers will
meet weekly deadlines and we antici-
pate regular weekly publication of
their work.

So, what if you aren’t selected or
can’t become part of “The
Opinionated Twelve?” Well, it still
leaves you with three options. First,
the old method of publication contin-
ues to exist to a limited extent. We will

still accept and publish submissions as
quality work surfaces and space
allows. Writers may want to develop
their writing skills using this route but
should be aware that this method will
be given last preference for publica-
tion.

We will also be featuring a new
type of writer this fall, someone yve are
calling a “newsmaker.” These writers
will be student organization officers
and campus leaders whose opinions
we will publish with two purposes in
mind. ,

The first is an effort for greater cir-
culation of ideas. Say, for example,
you don’t have time to go to the next
Student Government Board meeting,
but you do want to know about the
new constitution the Constitutional
Review Committee is proposing. With
this in mind, we will be asking SGB
President Jeff Alex and others
involved in the review process to
appear as “newsmakers” to offer you
their perspectives.

The other purpose is to do our part
to expand campus dialogue. Basically,
if you‘ don’t know what’s happening

on campus, it’s going to be difficult for

you to be involvedor for you to par-
ticipate in informed debate about cam-
pus issues. ‘

We call on all campus organiza-
tions to consider this opportunity. Are
you an officer in a campus organiza-

.. tion? Do you have, something to_ say

that Pitt needs to hear? Consider writ-
ing a newsmaker column. Contact us

‘and we’ll help you get started.

The third method of using our sec-

tion to express your opinion is by sim-

ply writing a letter to the editor. This
year we are urging students and the
University community to send us feed-
back. Did you find a colunm or article
stimulating? Write us. Did you find a
column or ‘article inarticulate or offen-

sive? Write us. Is there a campus com-

munity issue about which Pitt News
readers should know? Write us. Send
your letters (250 words or less) to The

Pitt News, 434 William Pitt Union, ‘

The University of ....Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh, PA 15260 or via e-mail at
pittnews @ pitt.edu.

In closing, we realize this column
‘contains a lot of information about

policies, procedures and changes. In
addition to our invitation to come
work with us, we also invite you to
come visit us on the fourth ﬂoor of the
Union. We would love_ .to meet with
you to discuss your suggestions, hear
your feedback or answer your ques-
tions.

David McKenzie and Megan Smith
look forward to working with you ‘this
year: .

Silencing conservatives inhibits intellectual growth

‘JOHN MARTIN JR.
‘ The Pitt News

During the last decade, diversity
has become all the rage at universities
across the country. Despite attempts to
represent every possible group under
the sun, we have forgotten the ﬂavor of
diversity I believe to be most important
to a university — intellectual diversity.

You may ask how I dare question
diversity within academia. My answer
is simple: conservative viewpoints are
sorely lacking.

I will grant you that universities
are typically places of liberal dis-
course, but this discourse seems to
have been censored such that the dis-
cussion has become nothing but one-
sided.

Several times during class discus-
sions I voiced conservative ideas that
quickly isolated me as an ideological
pariah. This is not a unique situation by
any means. Conservative students at
universities across the nation have been
under siege in recent years, as is docu-
mented by the group Young America’s
Foundation and also by columnist John
Leo of U.S. News & World Report.

A particularly vile example is the
seizure of campus newspapers, such as
The Daily Cal at the University of

Califomia—Berkeley following the pub— .

lication of the David Horowitz adver-
tisement against slavery reparations in
February and April.

It would seem that holding an opin‘—
ion outside the “politically correct”
mainstream makes one a second-class
citizen.

If you choose to believe in politi-
cally correct ideas after critical
thought, I have no problem with that.
But universities should be a place of
civil debate, and debate needs multiple
viewpoints.

‘As a moderate conservative, I
rarely have difficulty finding someone
with whom to debate given the liberal
proclivities of the campus community.
I am pro—capitalism, anti—egalitarian-
ism, and actually love my country
(gasp./). I voted for George W. Bush in
November. I wish we had a few more
Supreme Court justices like Antonin
Scalia.

But I must confess to being pro-
choice and generally pro—environment.
Since I’m not an ultra-ideologue, I
would have imagined that I would find

many kindred spirits at Pitt. ‘Nothing -

could be further from the truth.

I can literally count the number of
people I know who voted for Dubya on
my hands. I have a higher number of
conservative/libertarian leaning
friends, but that still pales in compari-
son to the number of liberals I know.

Please do not construe this as an
attack_ on Democrats; I support moder-
ates such as Sens. Zell Miller, D-Ga.,
and John Breaux, D-La. I just have a
problem with the ideas of hard-line lib-

erals like Sens. Hillary Clinton, D-
N.Y., and Pat Leahy D-Vt. I would
expect others to share these views in a
setting that is supposed to be a market-
place of ideas. V

This leads me to wonder, where
have all the conservatives gone? I
believe the cult of political correctness
helped silence a large number of closet
conservatives, who I think are afraid to
voice their opinions — no matter how
benign —— because of the heat they will
take from friends and professors.

Ah yes, and how about those pro-
fessors? Like anyone else, they too are
entitled to opinions. It just strikes me
as odd that so few (nearly none) lean to
the right. And let’s not kid ourselves —

they have a great deal of inﬂuence on

the minds of collegians.

So what can we do to rectify this
situation? I think the first course of
action is to consider ideas of all types,
even those that we may ﬁnd hateful or
distasteful. .

An excellent example of this would
be David Horowitz’s advertisement
regarding reparations, which several
student newspapers across the country,
including The Pitt News, rejected. We
should listen to his ideas with the same
rigor as we listen to the ideas of any

figure on the left and then enter into 

civil debate. _

This civil debate should include no
name—calling or personal threats. I
firmly believe you should attack _the

idea, never the person. I think this need
for open debate holds true for faculty
and staff as well. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if there are some closet conserv-

‘atives in the ranks of academia.

We should try to balance the types
of speakers we bring in. We have been
treated to Jeff Goldblum and Al
Sharpton, among others, and in fairness
to Newt Gingrich as well. I’m not look-
ing for conservative preference‘, by any
means. But I’ just want something
approaching parity, a situation where
notable conservatives such as William
F. Buckley wouldn’t be harassed for
setting foot in Oakland.

SGB and the student organizations
must sponsor more left-right debate
and encourage interaction between the
various ideological groups.

By silencing. or ignoring the con-
servative voices on campus, we are
allowing a valuable opportunity to
learn and debate to ‘slip away.

It is high time that we as students
start to consider viewpoints that may
be outside the liberal box.

You don’t have to agree, but just
afford the conservatives the courtesy of
having their voices heard and consid-
ered. By doing this, we all might learn
something.

John Martin J1: encourages you to
think before you‘ silence someone,

regardless of his or her political aﬁili-‘

ation.

Human rights on the line: We must oppose Fast Track

The Free Trade Area of the Americas is
an agreement, similar to the World Trade
Organization, which will be implemented in
some fonn by 2005. At the ﬁnal negotiations
in Quebec, thousands showed up to nonvio-
lently protest the FTAA the many legitimate
concerns.

The FTAA is basically an expansion of
the North American Free Trade Agreement
in three ways. NAFTA, which includes the
United States, Canada and Mexico, has been
gradually reducing the three nations’ trade
barriers. The FTAAwill include every coun-
try in North and South America except Cuba
and will effect the whole hemisphere.

It privatizes many markets that were
previously regulated by local governments,
such as transportation, sanitation, education,
health care, energy and water supplies. Giant
corporations will then have considerable
control over these markets throughout the
hemisphere. Consequently, govemments of
poorer countries will have less power over
these companies. These same countries,

though, have large populations of poor peo-

ple in dire need of decent health care, clean
water, education and living wage jobs -
something that privatization cannot
guarantee them.

will also be removed, forcing governments
to give equal consideration to both foreign

and domestic corporations regardless of

the foreign corporations’ labor and
environmental practices or monopo-
listic tendencies.

The FTAA will
ﬁrel scapegoat-

to stop them. Common exploitative policies
include prohibiting unionization and collec-
tive bargaining for reasonable working con-
ditions, minimal health care or a living wage.

NAFTA has been counterproductive at
best since it resulted in a net loss of jobs and
lower wages and allowed some corporations
to bypass laws made to protect people’s
health.

For example, in 1999, the Canadian cor-
poration Methanex sued the U.S. govern-
ment for $970 million because California

cancer risks and damages the nervous sys-
tem. Methanex, which makes the methyl in
MTBE, alleges that the MTBE phase-out
will reduce proﬁts $970 over the next 20
years.

This is just one of the NAFTA-related

investor-to-state lawsuits. VV1th the FTAA, _
they could occur everywhere in the herni-
sphere. . -

I KNOW WHAT YOU DIDTHIS SUMMER
Daring to live with a stranger

JENNY MCDOWELL
The Pitt News

A week before the spring term ended,
I got a call ﬁom a hysterical Japanese girl
responding to my classiﬁed ad seeking a
roommate. I was about to make a decision
when this girl, a ﬁeshman, told me in bro-
ken English how her ﬁiend had decided
not to share an apartment with her at the
last minute —. leaving her with no place to
live for the summer. I felt badly for the
girl. I met with her the next day and a
week later helped her move into my apart-
ment.

For about a month I enjoyed my
roommate’s company. Having been in this
country for less than a year, she had never
experienced many of the exciting things
Pittsburgh has to offer, like grocery shop-
ping at “Ghetto” Eagle. On her ﬁrst gro-
cery shopping experience she bought an
eggplant, shampoo and a 12-pack roll of

, toilet paper. I laughed like I laughed when

I asked her if she liked “J-Lo” and she
responded how much she loved to eat Jell-
0.

But then I stopped laughing and start-

ing growing more fearful, even though at

5 feet tall, she was not particularly intirni- .

dating.
Often I would be awakened at 7 am.
by screaming in Japanese. When I would
inquire about the screaming she would tell
me that the phone rang and she did not like
phone calls in the morning.

On the ﬂipside, she was a talented
artist.

But she would use her talent to draw
huge naked pictures of Courtney Love.
When I mentioned the drawings to her, she
would shoot a stern glance in my direction
and say, “I love the Courtney Love.”

Another weird experience that might
have clued me in to future problems was
the night I was lying in bed watching
“Saturday Night Live” when she began
screaming from her bedroom repeatedly,
“I cannot sleep!”

I ran into her bedroom to see what the
problem was, scared that she was sick and
needed to. go to the hospital. She just kept
yelling the same three words. I ﬁnally
asked what she wanted me to do about it,
and in a somewhat calmer voice she told
me, “TV too loud. I cannot sleep!”

The next month, she would not talk to.
me because I had taken a second job and
would not come home until late some

nights. She wanted me home whenever

she was home so thatl couldpay constant
attentionto her. _

If we were in the kitchen at the same
time, shewould start slamming cans and
boxes of food around in protest of my sec-
ond job, while making sighing noises and
stomping around with her arrns- folded at
her waist. After a few minutes she would
go to her bedroom, which was right oil‘ of
the kitchen, and ﬂing shut her curtain sub-
stitute for a door. ~

One night I needed to use the phone,
and since my roommate was constantly
online, I asked, her to get off. She "refused,
yelling that she needed the computer
despite the fact that she had been online
half the day and was only using instant
messenger. V

I ﬁnally became assertive and asked

to use the phone again. She tore the phone‘

cord out of the wall and whipped me with
it, stomping back into her room and throw-

Skycoaster was when my friends asked me
if Iwanted tobethethirdone on the ride, but
the pleasant and fun-ﬁlled day at

mood.

“Sure,” I said. “What is it?”

“That,” and they pointed up. Way up.

it stood. At ﬁrst sight, a ride best described as
a cross between bungee jumping and pure,

into the air. Then a rider pulls the ripcord and
the group free falls toward the small lake
below.

Now, I doubt anyone who knows me
would classify me as a “risk taker,” and
looking way up at ﬂie ride shot a little dose
of terror through my veins. I tend to stay safe
andbesonylaterthatIdidn’ttakethe
chance. I

“Heck,” I thought, “If people died on it,
they wouldn’t let you ride it.”

All day, my nervous excitement built as ,

the event approached. I was doing some-
thing crazy. Granted, I was going to be

' strapped into a harness with two otherpeo-

ple in the middle of a family amusement
park, but it was a big step for someone who
didn’t even jump oﬂ’ the high dive until he

’ was almost 13. '

Jump time rolled around.

“Okay, who wants to pull the ripcord?”
the attendant asked

‘”I'ony’ll do it”Atthis point, Irealizedl
really wasn’t making decisions on my own.

The attendant explained that I had to
pull the ripcord in one smooth motion when
Iheard “Three  Two  One  FLY!”
My responsibility plagued me and I began
asking obnoxious questions. “What exactly
does theripcorddo?VV1llIbeabletohear
the armouncer? What if I don’t pull it fast
enough?” The guy shot me one ﬁnal
armoyed look and I shut up.

Face down, we began our ascent. The

rest of our friends were below us on a small"

bridge over the lake, waving and taking pic-
tures. I focused on them as my sweaty palm
held the ripcord tightly.

I looked up for second and saw
Kennywood at dusk with the lights of the
park glimmering. The View would have
brought tranquility if my entire body wasn’t
shivering and my heart wasn’t beating so
hard I could hear the buckles on my hamess
clinking together.

Then the moment came. “Three. . .” ‘
There were speakers at the top of the
tower, soil could hear clearly. '
“Two. . .”
I looked down at our ﬁiends, the little
platform, and the lake. Whoa. ‘
“One...” ’ - ' _
t Then I remernberedl still had my glass-

eson.

“FLYI” ' *

I pulled the ripcord and we fell, scream-
ing and our friends zooming in like some
bizane, life-sized camera lens.

Somehow, during the fall and subse-
quentswinging, Ihadmanagedtograband i

secure my glasses. .

We swung around for a little, back and
forth over the lake and the bridge, before
being pulled down and taken out of the har-
nesses. We strolled over, adrenaline purnp-

ing and smiles beaming, to watch the video ‘

of our I have to admit, it looked pret-

student cringe. Except, thank heaven, we’re
not in high school anymore.

And ironically, now that I’m not‘
requiredtobeatthistopic intothe ground I

every fall, I actually have something inter-
estingtowrite about Ispentamajorpartof
this sumrneracﬁnginmyveryﬁrstﬁlm

’ Now it’s not one of those “coming soon
to a theater near you” type deals. I didn’t co-
star with Tom Hanks or Ben Aﬂleck (unfor-
tunately). And unless you’re an avid inde-
pendent ﬁlm ‘bulf, or you frequent ﬁlm fes-

tivals in odd litﬂe comers of the earth, you’ll ,

probably never see or hear of “Special Ops,”
a story about a secret agent whose partner is

kidnapped

I play Bethany, the ﬁancee of the secret_

agent. Much to my horror and elation, my
character falls victim to the action—packed
nature of the ﬁlm. . . . ‘

. During a shootout between her ﬁance
and the “bad guys,” a bullet strikes Bethany.
It was fantastic in one respect — I got to do
the whole melodramatic, near-death bit and
play with fake" blood. ' -

But on the other hand, I detest guns and I
let me assure you, my screams during that

scene were 110 percent real. _
Filming a movie in general was a dif-

ferent experience than I’d ever been int:ro— ’ I

ducedto in all my years on thestage. No

V -dress rehearsal, no opening night, no _live

audience and no curtain call. And no one
applauded when we ﬁnished a scene.

Then again, if you screwup, the direc-
torwillyell“Cut!” and you get the chanceto
doitagain... andagainandagainand
again. And compliments of my ﬁlm debut,
my vocabulary now includes a plethora of
words such as “gaffer,” “sides”and “stand-
m.”. ~ , .

A Some things about stageand ﬁlm are
very similar +— we simply call them by dif-
ferent names. Onstage We drop lines. Inﬁlm

we make bloopers. Theaters have divas. »

Movies have prima donnas. I guess some
things in life are constants.

I’d1oveto tell you to run to your near- '

est Blockbuster and rent “Special Ops,” but

_it hasn’t quite made it that far. _ Shockingly,

low budget indies don’t seem to be racking
up the big bucks these days.

But if you’re really and truly interested, I
I’m sure my mom will lend you one of her‘

copies.

dents, staff, faculty and even Oakland resi-
dents. I hope you notice our effort to recruit
the best writers and reporters Pitt has to olfer
and a similar effort to unearth stories that
will prove important to all of you. I hope
you notice unbiased sports reporting. I hope
you ﬁnd enlightening social commentary
and personal columns worthy of hanging on
your corkboard.

This being said, it is important to
remember that The Pitt News is not a public
relations rag for the University. A newspa-
per’s goal is to provoke thought and ﬁnd
truth, no matterhowpainﬁilthattruthmay
be to hear. So understand that it is as much
our responsibility to report on potentially
embarrassing University gaﬂes as it is to
report on stellar achievements.

Butourjobistoreportonwhatallof
you do. Ourjob is to draﬁ columns in reac-
tion to or anticipation of what you’re doing.
In many ways, the success of The Pitt News
is linked inextricably with the success of the
student body. We can’t report on hordes of
crazed Panther fans at the ﬁrst football game
of the year if you’re not there. We can’t
remark on student protests or rallies if you
don’t organize them. And we can’t cover
every important or interesting happening at

this University if you don’t tip us 011".

We are a ﬁiendly and inviting staﬁ‘
(really, we are!) and we want to know if you
think we’re holding up to our promises. I
challenge you to hold me to my words here
this year. Log on to our newly improved
Web site, wvvw.pittnews.com, and watch
video highlights. Read the paper without
leaving your room or apartment and then
send electronic feedback to our columns
and articles. Respond to our online polls and
surveys. Send me well-articulated and
informed letters and e-mails. Ifyou’re par-
ticularly incensed, call my oﬂice directly.
Most importantly, if you think you can do a
better job, stop by the oﬂice and apply for
one. If you’re good enough, we just might
hire you. -

So please, keep reading. Get to know
The Pitt News again because we’re raising
the bar this year. My inkling is that by the
end of the year, I’ll feel a lot like I did by the
end of my ride on The Phantom’s Revenge
———— hair pulled out,.heart beating fast, eyes
tearing ﬁom the wind, a huge dopey grin on
my face and very glad I did not die.

Shannon McLaughlin is editor in chief of
The Pitt News and was dead serious when
she invited the student body to keep her on
her toes this year:

mg a temper tantrum in Japanese.

' The next morning, I went out to
breakfast. When I returned, her room was
empty and her apartment keys were
thrown on the kitchen ﬂoor. She was sup-
posed to live with me for another month
and a half. This didn’t seem to matter to
her. She didn’t leave a note, but did leave
a check for half the rent. That check
bounced. _

This summer I was a sucker. I am
going to be a senior in college and I
allowed a ﬁreshman from a foreign coun-
try to walk all over me. I let her pay rent
late. I cooked her meals. I drove her places
she needed to go.

But most of all I otfered her a place to
live when she was going through a hard
time. I didn’t even know who she was. I
just felt sorry for her.

Don’t bedeceived like I was. Go with
your gut and not with your compassion.
And if you ever meet a girl from Japan
who tells you that she loves to eat J ell-O,
run like the wind.

es you to avoid letting strange and imma-

Fast Track’ to

trade disaster
Skibba, page 36

be voted on in early September. Ifit passes,
it will go to the Senate, where it will likely
faceless opposition.

Trade Promotion Authority, formerly
called Fast Track, stipulates that Congress
cannot amend trade deals negotiated by the

’ president. But hundreds of corporate lobby-

ists still have plenty of access to “US. trade
negotiators through closed-door trade advi-
sory committees.

So by stiﬂjng normal democratic proce-
dures and eliminating corporate account-
ability, Fast Track paves the way for more
trade deals that undercut our environment,
labor, health and safety. -

It is essential that trade negotiators be
held accountable to Congress to ensure that
environmental and labor ‘ provisions of
future trade deals are enforced. We need to
encourage stronger public participation and
democratic oversight in policy-making,
including etfective enviromnental reviews.
We cannot accomplish this if the Fast Track
bill is passed, and so we must urge our local
representatives to oppose it.

Free culture caters
to broke students

HEATHER BOWLAN
Staff Writer

Now that you’re back (or just arriving) on
campus, you’re probably feeling the restraint
of a college student’s budget. Relax, you don’t
have to start panhandling on Forbes Avenue
just yet — here are some ’
practically (or in most
cases, totally) free ways
to enjoy the city without
resorting to partying in a
packed-basement in South
Oakland. _ '-

2 When you’re looking
for an artistic way to
spend a few hours, your
first and best bet is Pitt
Arts, Pitt’s connection to ‘
music, theater, galleries
and ﬁlms. Pitt Arts sends
out a weekly e-list of trips
to different events that are
all free unless otherwise
noted, plus tells you
about additional happen-

Most of the time they
feed you before you pile
on the big ol’ cheese bus.

my love 

The ofﬁcial new year may
have started nine months ago, but
for me, the new year always
begins in September. For some
reason, a glittering ball in Times
Square, sparkly confetti and party _
hats can’t compare to crisp, clean ,  
pages in a new notebook, new
pens and pencils and a “back to
school” shopping trip.

I admit that I still shop for
“back to school” « clothes every

the things I “must have” before I- Leslie Hoffman

matter that it’s usually 98 degrees _ . ,
on the first day of school; I still have to be prepared with

- _the,latest style ‘of cords and aspiffy sweater. Regardless of

_ ~ theheat, somehowthis practice still seems logical; the con-
' tents? of my, brain have never been dictated by the wash of

_jeans I wear or the thread count of apolo shirt. --

, ” These clothes’ that I decide I “must have” aren’t direct-

ly inﬂuenced by a‘ magazine or catalog,-but myselfand

“the look” I’m trying topull off that year. Previous fall .

looks have included “hip,” “smart,” “urban,” “fun” and
“edgy.” p .  . V _ p _
My sophomore year in high school, I started-wearing

tight clothes and lots of makeup to keep up with my rich, 2 I

fashion-obsessed peers; my ﬁrst year of college at an urban
university, my wardrobe was infused with a million black
shirts, black pants, black dresses and black shoes.
Yes, Iknow it’s silly. » ‘ I V e — 1
Yet I continue each year. It’s amazing how feeling
comfortable on the outside can make you feel more com-
fortable on the inside, too. My habit has developed from

early years of playing dress up in ridiculously glitzy

. clothes and pretending to be someone else. For me, dress— 2
_ ing up to portray a different style is basically for ﬁm and
my own personal amusement. IfI want to pretend to be .

“glamorous,” I merely wear a pair of impractical high
heels to class. ‘;

But this year, the Arts and Entertainment section has
gone shopping for a new “back to school” look. Its form,
however, has been designated by its new function — it will
not be wearing impractical stilettos to class despite the fact
that they’re cooler than loafers. V

The Arts and Entertainment section is expanding to

three days a week this year, as opposed to two days a week
' last year. Mondays, readers can expect a wide range of fea- ‘

ture stories; Wednesdays, reviews; and Fridays, a weekend

section.

. Across the entire section, expect to see more album,

, theater and ﬁlmjreviews, asiwellas a’dive’rsefcrosfs section g" L‘ :_

of what’s happening in Pittsburgh that college students will
ﬁnd interesting. Feel free to contact The Pitt News to let us
know what you want to read.

So what ‘does the new look of the Arts and
Entertainment section promise its readers this year?

Look in the mirror.’

Caliban Book Shop occupies a spot on South Craig Street, but the owner also
maintains a warehouse in Wilkinsburg that houses more than 70,000 books.

Used bookstores 
of the city

ERIC LIDJI
‘ Senior Staff Writer

The reasons for shopping used are well
known. _ ’

Just practically, the books are always
cheaper, and often an older

owns the store along with his wife, Emily
Hetzel. “I’m always buying,” he said. ‘
‘ Schulrnan has been selling books in
some form for the last 25 years; he is only
38. Since" 1991, he has run Caliban on
South Craig Street. But in Wilkinsburg, he
owns a warehouse that houses 70,000 more
books for sale over the Internet. _
As a teen—ager he sold books out of his
home. ' _
“I had 9,000 volumes in this tiny apart
ment,” Schulman said. - '
Schulman comes from a family of
teachers. His father was

degree in education at

illustration, a previous
owner’s doodles or just the fact that it is a
ﬁrst edition. *

But the advantages continue. One of
the many nice things about used bookstores
is that you can go to several different stores
in the same afternoon and keep up a high
level of intrigue because, unlike new book-
stores, by their 1 very nature "every used
bookstore will have a different selection.

Oakland is lucky enough to have a

handful of used bookstores that, while simg ‘

ilar, all would still work if they were the
only such store for miles. ' ,

Here is a look at two of the used book- 3
stores in the Oaklandarea. Whet_her you are
shopping for classes or for pleasure, these
stores are all about the books.

Caliban Book Shop, 410 S. Craig St.

_ In the time that Caliban Book Shop has
been in business, they have sold more than '
30,000 volumes. T " ‘f -

. Pitt. For
Schulman even taught in the writing pro-
gram here. , «
“It occurred to me, why aml trying to
get a job teaching when what I really love
is books? This is really my ﬁrst love,”
Schulman said. _
_For a whﬂe the original store didn’t
have a cash register or even any heat, but
slowly the business grew and “luxuries”
became standards. Now Caliban is the only
bookstore in southwest Pemisylvania that is
a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers of
American Association, which provides a
set of codes and ethics to rare and scholarly
book dealers, as well as book fairs and other
resources to book dealers.
"But he always remains very conscious

0 about making sure that there is a divide

between the store and the warehouse. It is

important tohim not to have the two 1oca- . '

tions competing as manybooksellers do by

Zoning out

TONY FRASCELLA
Staff Writer

About three weeks after the
semester begins, students will have
already figured out which classes to
skip, what homework can be put off

~ and how many hours each night can

be devoted to taking advantage of
their digital cable. The fall television

season kicks off in September with a S

wealth of new shows.
Taking cues from Rob Lowe and
Martin Sheen, many established

“Undeclared,” a look at college life
through the eyes of freshmen living in

obnoxious parent make the transition
with familiar awkwardness. Former
“Freaks and Geeks” co-star Seth

Rogen adds his talents as an
“Undeclared” classmate and staff
writer.

Returning to TV this year are
Ellen DeGeneres (“Ellen”) and Jason
Alexander (“Seinfeld”). In “The Ellen

savvy L.A. girl who returns home to
put her life together after she loses it

“The Princess and the‘Warrior”.
Written and directed by Thom Tykwer
ﬁﬁﬁﬁ ' nj »

ERIC LIDTI
Senior Staff Writer ‘

To the disappointment of some and
the delight of others, the summer movie
season is coming to a close. I

In the coming month, the tone of fea-
ture ﬁlms will ‘change from large and
showy to more award show competition.
Some ﬁlmgoers might experience with-
drawal and desire a few more romances or

. car crashes. Some might need some sort of

transition to aid theshock of the switch,
and so ‘The Princess and the Warrior”

_ steps in to provide the unguent to the bum-

ing in your moviegoer soul.

For starters, “The Princess and the
Warrior,” like “Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon,” is not really about princesses and
warriors in the literal sense. It is a sub-par
title that lends itself to a Disney movie

starring the voices of Whitney Houston as.
. the princess, James Van Der Beek as the
warrior, and Scott Thompson from “Kids .

in the Hall” as the gopher who saves the
day. « ' 
This story, though, is about ﬁgurative

. princesses and warriors, and while maybe

not as cute as that lovable gopher, it too is
a story about love, fate and decisions. And
yet it’s still cool to watch. j

The two converging stories‘ are those
of Sissivand Bodo. Sissi is a devoted nurse
in an insane asylum that consumes almost
every aspect of her life.’ Bodo is a hard-
ened veteran living with ‘ his brother,
mourning the losses he has incurred and
attempting, along with his brother, to get
out of the life they are stuck in. W K‘

But the problems of Sissi and‘ Bodo
bring them together. .

 

COURTESY WWW.IMDB.COM

Sissi is out taking a walk with one of
her blind patients. In the same area Bodo is

running from two store clerks from whom "
he has just shoplifted. In his attempt to lose" »
the clerks, Bodo accidentally distracts a ,
truck driver and causes an accident. Sissi '

gets trapped underneath the truck.
Meanwhile, Bodo is running around
the area, still unaware of the crash. He

[ makes his way back to the crash site while

still being chased. Seeing the stopped

truck, he decides to hide underneath where

he ﬁnds Sissi.- ' ,
He sees that she carmot breathe and

‘performs a makeshift tracheotomy by cut-
ting her windpipe and breathing into her ,

lungs with a drinking straw. He escorts her
to the hospital, and then he is gone. '
But once she is healed, Sissi carmot

stop thinking about Bodo, and she sets out .

to ﬁnd him. Their stories progress and
off.

movie that cases you into fall? _
This is a romance where the lead cou-

ple never kisses or proclaims their love for ' 9
one another. Where writer/director Thom ‘

Tykwer’s (“Run, Lola, Run”) themes of
connectivity and" synchronicity aren’t just
in the script, but mimicked by the savvy
dissolves and unconventional uses of the
camera, and the hip-hoptrhythm of the

hypnotic, constant, yet unobtrusivescore. .

The silences have a sense of» beauty and

German is spoken with the ﬂair that we
Americans usually reserve for French 0 .

t This is the tme summer movie; This
has the visual ﬂair that we ogle at the the-
aters every summer and -ﬂre substance that
brings us back in the fall that surprises us
and engages our minds -all year long.

This is the preparation for movies to

. lowing exchange on the ﬁrst page allayed '

my fears — “Grain alcohol? Who said any-
thing about grain alcohol?” '

“You can’t have a really good party
without it. Not the kind
of party I’m talking
about.” T

‘That stuff ’ll f---
you up,” I said , to
myself, trying to sound
as though I were speak-
ing from experience. It
was a tone .I’d pretty
much mastered in my
ﬁrst two and half years
of college. »

This was certainly
a conversation and
tone I’d heard many
times before. '

“Wow,” I thought
to myself, ‘This. guy
really knows his stuff.”

Written by Tom Perotta, '“Joe.

College” is the story of Danny, a junior
English major at Yale, and his spring break
spent back home in New Jersey, driving
“The Roach Coach,” his father’s lunch
truck. A
The story is strong, the characters like-
able and Perrotta’s frank and descriptive
humor is appealing. Darmy is dealing with
his share of girl problems — there’s Cindy,
a girl from his high school who won’t stop

calling, and‘Po11y, a “Yalie” who comes.

from an entirely different’ world than
Danny. He’s also busy contending with

Monsters” who are threatening his,father’s
business, not to mention I_)aImy as well.
Although large parts of the novel are
funny, it has its serious and even heart-
rending moments. Throughout the story,
Danny struggles to reconcile his blue-col-
lar background with his Yale surroundings.

_ It seems as if no one else comes from the

working class world he returns to during
spring break. When he hears people across
the hall from his dorm room listening to
Bruce Springsteen, it upsets him.

. “I wasn’t a huge Springsteen fan, but I
always felt a bit proprietary about his
music when I heard it at Yale. It didn’t
sound right in this context, played for the
enjoyment of people who were going to
end up being the bosses of people the Boss
was singing about,” Danny says.

Joe College, while being
the story of one particular
student in an Ivy League
school, contains scenarios
that all students are familiar
with. Who among us does-
n’t know the chaos of the
cafeteria or the ever-shift-
ing dynamics of roommate
friendships?

Best of all is Perrotta’s
description of a parental
visit. “Though taxing for
everyone, these encounters
weremost stressful for the
person whose parents had
come to visit. How could it
have been otherwise?
There was something so nakedly revealing
about being seen in the presence of the
people who had made you and raised you.
It was the Return of the Repressed, the
pasts we had tried to conceal upon our
arrival at college suddenly taking human
form and walking through the door with

 

care packages in their anns and faces a lot ’

like our own.” _
“Joe College” is an ideal book for set-

tling back into the routine of the school

year. Read it if you want to explore larger
issues that college forces you to deal with,
if you’ve ever wondered what it would be

.. like to attend an Ivy League school, or if

you just want to laugh out loud.

Cheap, from page 42

For free music, head Downtown
for the Luncheonette al Fresco in
Market Square, as well as the
Noontime Concerts at the USX
Tower or Mellon Square — they fea-
ture most kinds of music, with a dif-
ferent band — and a different sound -
every. day.

If you’re in the mood to dance,
Tuesday and Thursday nights the
club Pegasus on Liberty Avenue

Downtown sponsors its ID-required
youth night for a minimal entrance
fee of ‘$3. The techno music at
Pegasus caters to an open-minded
crowd.
You might want to take advan-
tage of the nice weather in the city
while you can. With that in mind,
head to Schenley Park, right across
the street from Phipps
-Conservatory, which is also free
with your Pitt ID. There’s plenty of
room for picnicking, playing Frisbee,

walking or contemplating nature
while cheesy elevator music plays in
the background. Phipps has a great
outdoor garden to explore. K
Heading back Downtown, Point
State Park offers plenty of room to

run around in the grass, a view of the

three rivers, as well as access to the
Waterfront Trail, a path for runners,

around the city.

Used bookstores

Books, from page 48

online. For Schulman, the warehouse caters
to a different set of people; the store
remains a place where the quality books are
still for sale. '

Schulman said the store is like “pre—
Internet days.” “Like how itused to be,” he
added.

So what kinds of things go into the
warehouse? —

f‘An upscale book on Polish ' grain
manufacturing that is going to be on the
shelf for ﬁve years,” Schulman said jocu-
larly.

Schulman keeps the best books in the
store up front and behind glass. He pulled a
few out. . ' ,
A copy of “Life of the Engineers” had

‘been inscribed to the head of U.S. Steel r

from Hemy Clay Frick on “X-Mas ‘79.”
That’s 1879.
Schulman also displays a‘ copy of the

_, autobiography of Thomas Mellon, the fore— ‘

father of the famous family, which had been
taken out of print for a while because it was
considered too. detailed. The University -of
Pittsburgh Press later reprinted it.

He spends three days a week at the
store and two at the ‘warehouse or making
house calls. -

‘‘If people are moving, divorcing or
dying, I buy their library,” he said.

He usually travels in a 50- to 100—rnile _

radius, depending on what he’s buying.

‘He said, “If it is a box of Faulkner ﬁrst
editions in Erie, I’ll be there the next day. If
it’s someone’s collection of book of the
month club books...” _ *

For Schulman, the book business isn’t
just buying and selling. He also appraises
books, manuscripts, photos or “anything in
print” for insurance purposes. And of
course not everyone takes good care of their

‘ books, so Schulman also repairs damaged

goods that come into the store. He said it’s

one of his “big forms of enjoyment.” He .
starts to get outsome of his tools of repair-

and comes across a hammer.

“I always have the hammer aroun ”
he stated. ..

Philip Core, one of the store’s employ-
ees, walked by. ‘”1‘hat’s more of a manage-
ment tool,” Core said.

Caliban’s intimate center is an intense-

love of books that has managed to have
success without losing“ the class 4 and
intrigue of the rare and scholarly bookstore.

Or, as Core putsit, “We offer biblio-

therapy.”

The Bryn Mawr—Vassar Bookstore, 4612
Winthrop St.

There .are two separate but equally ﬁt-
ting quotes within the boundaries of the

- Bryn Mawr-Vassar Bookstore that describe
‘ _ the philosophy and experience of shopping

there.

The ﬁrst, dug right into a patch of con-
crete outside the bookstore on Winthrop
Street, is a blunt and personal armounce_-
ment that reads, quite simply, “I Love

, Books!”

‘ _ The second and more formal one
hangs on the wall opposite the front door so
that it can’t be missed. Attributed to “Roger
of MARTIN, l979,” it reads: °

“Naturally you’re out of book space.
Everyone is out of book space. If you’re not
out of book space, you’re probably not
worth knowing.” ' _ . y

A third a quote, hanging next to the
door and visible on the way out, helps
explain the situation more clearly. Written
most likely by aproprietor or an employee,

' it describes the purpose of the store:

ALL of our books are donated.

ALL of our workers are volunteers.

ALL of our proﬁts’ go to scholarships.

ALL of us thank you. .

The Bryn Mawr-Vassar Bookstore has
been around nearly 40 years, and close to
30 at its present location. On July 31, the
store began its largest restoration and reno-

' vation since it opened.

Sheila Fisher is one of the volunteers
and the person in charge of public relations;
she has been with the organization from its
beginning. The renovations are a- milestone
in the history of Bryn Mawr-Vassar. Fisher
doesn’t know for sure when the store will
be ready to reopen; the renovations range
from changing the shelves to replacing the
wiring. ‘ '

“We are hoping for Labor Day,” she

said with a ‘smile.
‘ Built from a gutted apartment, one of _

Bryn Mawr-Vassar’s unique characteristics
is the maze of rooms that contain books.

— Two steep c1assi'cPittsburgh staircases lead »

up to four rooms where each room contains
diﬁerent types of books. The basement of
the store houses books and magazines as
well. Closets and doorways have been
opened and books line their walls and

ﬁames. Every .wa]l ‘upstairs has a book-5
- V shelf, yet there is still not enough room.

. All of the bookstore’s proﬁts go to the
two colleges in the name of the store.

- Originally, the store existed only in the form

-of ayearly sale‘ in Oakland’s St. Nicolas

Cathedral, where as many as 35,000 books

weresold. '.  _ V
Around .1972, Fisher decided that it

would be easier to ‘open a store and allow. « L

customers to shop year round. Since those
ﬁrst days in the church, the book selling has
produced nearly $1 million in scholarships.
7 There are many Bryn Mawr stores, but
this is the only one paired with another col-
lege, and all the proﬁts ‘are split 50-50.

Strong passing game will need help from young backfield

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

It’s out with the old and in with the
new for the 2001 Pitt offense as the
team lost quarterback John Turrnan,
running back Kevan Barlow, center Jeff
McCurley and wideout Latef Grim to
graduation.

However, through the hard work of
head coach Walt‘ Harris and his staff on
the recruiting trail over the past five
years, the team has plenty of depth on
the offensive side of the" ball and a nice ‘
mixture of veterans and youth.

Of course, the most important
retumee to the offense is Heisman
Trophy candidate Antonio Bryant. The
junior wideout was rewarded with the
Biletnikoff Trophy last season, which is
given to the nation’s top wide receiver.
Bryant led the nation in receiving yards
last season, averaging 130.2 per game.

Offensive coordinator J .D.
Brookhart will plan to spread the
defense out with his offensive attack,
while f1rst—year running backs coach
Shawn Simms will have the duty of
acclimating and evaluating seven fresh-
man, in order to set a backﬁeld for the

The Pitt defense was among the best in the Big
East last year. .It was ranked.»ﬁrst in sacks, second in
scoring defense, second in rushing defense, and third
in total defense. The 2001 version is quickly coming
together at the UPMC.Complex on the South Side.
The complex is abuzz with candidates for just about
every major defensive award on the national level,
with excited coaches, and with a vaunted freshman
class. Experience at all positions is as deep as it has
been in years, and the players are eager to live up to
the preseason hype and build on the success of last
year. ‘

Defensive coordinator Paul Rhoads said things
are rough at the beginning of training camp, but
expects his experienced team to quickly jell.

“I think we need to play better against the run as
a whole group,” said Rhoads, who is in his second

Seasoned kicking game and

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

There is a reason ‘special teams are
called special. The players on this part of the
team are on the ﬁeld for only a limited nu1n—
ber of ‘plays, but their impact on those few
plays can determine the outcome of the
game. _ '

“You play this position because you
want the pressure,” senior place kicker Nick
Lotz said. “Other guys on the team might
not even realize how early we go out before
the rest of the team. Our practice is basically
done once the rest of the team gets out there.
You want the game to come down to you, so
we are deﬁnitely ready.”

In the 2000 campaign Pitt ﬁnished the
season fourth in the Big East on kick returns
with an average of 20.3 yards per retum. The
Panthers also ﬁnished fourth in the Big East
on punt yard average with 33.2 yards per
punt, and fourth in ﬁeld goal percentage with
a .667 average. In punt return yardage, the
Panthers ﬁnished sixth with an average of
8.4 yards. per retum. -

These stats might seem only mediocre,
but coming off of the 1999 season where Pitt
lost kicker Greg DeBolt and kick retumer
Hank Poteat, the 2000 season was a nice
step in the right direction. ‘

This year, Pitt returns all of ﬂreir key
special teams players; senior place kicker
Nick Lotz is returning for his fourth season
in a Panther uniform. Last season Lotz was
10-15 in ﬁeld goal opportunities and 29-31
on extra point tries. _

“Nick brings three years as the starting
place kicker,” Specialists coach Bryan Deal
said. ‘This is his year, he should have a great
year and conﬁdence, and so should the team
in him.”

This year Lotz is back and ready to take
full advantage of his last year as a Panther.

“My motivation is that it’s my last year.
This might be the last time I get to go out and
kick footballs,” Lotz said. “I know I have the
tools to do it, so I’m just going to go out there
and get the job done.”

_ Sophomore Andy Lee also is a retum-
ing starter from last year. After taking over
for Jay Junko early in the year, Lee went on
to kick 30 punts on the year and average
almost 40 yards per punt Now with a year
of experience under his belt, Lee expects to
improve even more.

Junko will back up Lee to begin the

year. In 2000 Junko had 21 kicks and aver-.

aged 34.1 yards perkick Junko is also prac-
ticing at wide receiver this year, so his time
at punter will be  However, accord-
ing to coach Bryan Deal, if a change is nec-
essary, Junko will be right there and ready to
go.

“We have two starting punters in our
program. Right now Andy lee is the punter,
andlaylunkoiscompetingtomakehima
better player,” said special teams coordinator
Bob Ligashesky. “We have no problem with

  returners anchor special teams

putting Junko in the game at any time in any
situation.” ’
The key to getting off a good punt or

4 ﬁeld goal starts with the long snapper. Red-

shirt sophomore and returning starter Kurt
Johnson will be back as the 2001 starting
long snapper after injuring himself in last
year’s Miami game. In 2000 Kurt had“’a lit-
tle trouble with some and snaps but with the
competition of sophomore Jonathan Sitter
and ‘a hard summer workout, Johnson
expects perfection in 2001.

“I think the competition is helping me a
lot. I’ve worked the hardest I’ve worked this
summer since I got here,” Johnson said. “I
feel ﬁne, perfect.”

Last season Pitt had six different players

retum kick-offs. Rod Rutherford returned a

team—high 258 yards off kick-offs, while
Tonie Cox and Darcey Levy returned 176
and 110 yards off kick-oﬁs, respectively.
Every season brings change and the
2001 season will see some change at the

kick-off retum spot. VV1th Rod Rutherford as ,

the ofﬁcial backup quarterback to David
Priestly this season, don’t expect to see
Rutherford returning many, if any “kick-offs,
this year. Also, Levy will not return kicks
this year. Instead, Levy will be a blocker for
Cox and new kick returner Shawntae
Spencer. _

‘‘I’m trying to lead the Big East in kick-
off returns this year,” Cox said. “Special
teams is going to be a big part of our team
this year.” , '

On punt returns, Antonio Bryant will
once again lead the charge. Last season
Bryant shared the duties with Tim Stein,

who returned 14 punts for 73 yards, while -

Bryant returned 16 punts for 181 yards. This

year Bryant is once again the man according »

to Deal. V
“Antonio is competitive, and he wants
to help the team anyway he can. He wants to
touch the football as much as he can,”
Ligashesky said. “We are going to have to
say ‘Antonio take a rest there,’ but he wants
the ball and anytime we can get the ball in
his hands that’s what we are going to do.”

' With Pitt having a much deeper team

this year, the blockers up front have yet to be
determined. Many different players are
competing for the available jobs. But, as
always, Gerald Hayes, Bryan Knight, and
Brian Beinecke -shouldpave the way for the
kick returners.

“I think that we have more players
available in the program that are more spe-
cial teams-type players,” Ligashesky said..
“So, I expect us to be improved in the spe-
cial teams phase.” p
, All the starters are back from last season
with a year of experience _under ﬂreir belt.
This year, Pitt hopes to win games with their
special teams and get back to the level that
specialtearnswereatinthe 1999 season.

“lt’s just a matter of relying on your
technique, taking a deep breath, and do what
you are supposed to do,” Deal said.

Loss of captain doesn’t

deter men’s

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

When the Pitt men’s soccer team takes

the ﬁeld this season, it will face the daunt-

ing task of replicating last year’s success.
The Panthers are coming off a season
in which they ﬁnished 13-5 overall and 7-

4 in the Big East after winning just seven _

games in 1999. The team also received
national recognition by being ranked
numerous times throughout the season,

including as high as seventh. The 13 wins I

were the second most in school history

while the team’s .722 winning percentage '

was the best ever. The team’s dream season
ended when it fell to Seton Hall in the Big
East Tournament quarterﬁnals 2-1.

Pitt lost six seniors from last year’s
squad, including three-year captain Ben
Gany, who led the Panthers with six goals.
Garry j is currently playing for the

Pittsburgh Riverhounds, a local profession-.

al team. The team will also be missing its
top scorer from a year ago, Spencer Barton,
who ﬁnished with 16 points. .
But, despite losing key players, hea

coach Joe Luxbacher feels this season’s
team can be just as competitive because of
a solid core. While captains Chris

Churchill and Justin Gaul will have to —

show leadership, the burden of carrying the
team will not be placed on any individuals.

“We’re not relying on one or two guys,
not one big goal scorer because we’re very
solid overall,” Luxbacher said.

Up front, the team will look to seniors
Mark Sikora and Peter Veltri to lead the
way. Sikora ﬁnished fourth on the team last
season in scoring,'netting four goals and 10
points while Veltri added seven. Also
returning are senior forwards Mike Butler

and Dave -
Marcinowski, who '
saw limited action last

year, while the team
has added‘ freshmen

and Brian Watson. '
But according to Luxbacher, the key to
the team’s success will be a very strong
defense, led by Churchill. Along with his
defensive capabilities, Churchill can score
as well, putting up 12 points in 2000. He
was named Big East co-defensive player of
the week for Sept. 4-10 and received post-

season honors by being named to ﬂie All '

Big East second team.
Joining Churchill on defense will be

juniors Josh Whitham and Miles Dowiak, I

who each contributed eight points last sea-
son, as well as Clay Haﬂich, Mike Doe and
Toure Weaver. ‘

. “We have no outstanding areas but we
have good athletes,” Luxbacher said.
“Obviously [Churchill] needs to be
strong.” '

Gaul will retain duties as goalkeeper ; .

after picking up 13, wins in his sophomore
campaign, including ﬁve shutouts. He
posted a 1.16 goals against average, allow-

ing just 21 goals in 18 contests, and was .

named the Big East goalkeeper of the week
for Sept. 4-10 and Big East co-goalkeeper
of the week Oct. 2-8. Also looking for time
in net will be junior Joe Conlan and fresh-
man Justin Lowery.

The Panthers will once again face
tough competition in the Big East, a con-

' ference that had ﬁve teams ranked in the

top 20 in 2000. « .
“We always expect to do well and play
like we’re capable of,” Luxbacher said.
“This conference is as strong as it gets.”
The Panthers will plunge into Big East
play when they open the season Sept. 1'

-against Rutgers. The game  be held at

Quaker Valley High School at 7 p.m.

Pitt predicted to finish

third in Big East

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

Giants Stadium is usually associat-
ed with professional football, but on

July 26, it was home to the Big East’

conference and its annual Football
Media Day.

Journalists from print, radio, and
television gathered in East Rutherford,
N.J., to question coaches and players
from all eight Big East teams. The pre-
season poll was also announced, with
Miami chosen to win the conference
championship after claiming the title
last season. Virginia Tech was project-
ed to finish second, while Pitt took the
third-place slot.

Each school was set up at a table
around the room where reporters were
given an hour to interview the coaches
and then an hour with the players. As
they moved freely about, many gravi-
tated toward Miami and new head
coach Larry Coker, who not only
addressed matters of football, but those

of academics as well. On more than

one occasion’, he stressed the impor-
tance of helping his players graduate.
Coker mentioned the team’s depth
at running back but many other coach-
es were qui'ck.to praise other players as
well. Syracuse head coach Paul
Pasqualoni-explained his liking of the
Hurricanes’ talent, depth, and skill.
“They have a great group of young
wide receivers,” Pasqualoni said.
“Their backs are excellent, and they
have a quarterback you gotta love.”
Rutgers also‘ displayed its new
head coach, Greg Schiano, who will

face the task of turning the program‘

around‘ and leading the Scarlet Knights
to a winning season. Schiano was
asked about the question mark that sur-
rounds the quarterback position, where
three players are vying for the starting
spot that was occupied by Mike
McMahon. He commented that coach-
es will be closely monitoring these

players as none stood out during spring .

practice. A

Like Coker, Schiano also discussed
academics, pointing out that while
there, are demands on the field, the
players are also expected to’ excel as
students. He considers -himself to be a
very demanding coach, which may
make it,difficult for his players.

“Division I college football is a
serious sport and to be successful you
have to be willing to sacrifice quite a
bit,” Schiano said.’ .

While Schiano discussed his team
and plans for the upcoming season,
others shared a few words on the coach
himself. Pasqualoni noted that the addi-

tion of New Jersey native Schiano to

the Rutgers program has created a pos-

itive change.
“For a long time, the people of

New Jersey have wanted a guy from’

New Jersey,” Pasqualoni said. “-I think
everyone is very excited to have him
here.” «

The third new coach in the Big East
is West Virginia’s Rich Rodriguez, who
feels his transition into the program has
been eased by what former coach Don
Nehlen and his staff put into place. He
also shared his hope and enthusiasm for
a hot, humid and brutal training camp,
claiming it would put his players into
better shape. While other programs
may put an emphasis on conditioning,

Rodriguez says that at West Virginia, it ..

is not an emphasis, but a way of life.

While Schiano echoed Rodriguez’s
desire for a 95-degree camp, Pitt team-
mates Geralda Hayes and Chad Reed
were not so willing to accept the idea.
Although they acknowledged that such
stifling conditions might help get them
in shape faster, neither thought it was
necessary.

“I’m not going to lie, we definitely
don’t want that temperature,” Reed
said. “We’re hoping for 60-degrees and
breezy.”

While Pasqualoni made no com-
ments on the weather, he did ‘say that he
wishes his team had more than the
allotted 29 practices, but his players are
in good condition. Schiano discussed
how many of his players have slimmed
down to give the Rutgers team a new,
leaner look. Boston College head coach

Tom O’Brien said his team has spent a

lot of time the past few years working

in the off-season and has never been

out of condition for opening game.
Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech was

Abombarded with questions of\t,he_

departed Michael Vick, and while’ he
called Vick “the greatest player in the
country” and said that he will be
missed, he also believes that the Hokies
have a solid program. The “coaches will
coach and prepare in the same manner
and run basically the same offense as
before and move on with the program.
As often as Beamer was asked
about Vick, Pitt head coach Walt Harris
was questioned about star receiver

Antonio Bryant, who had been making

headlines with non—football related
incidents. Hefwas also asked to com-
ment on the team’s “soft” opening
schedule against East Tennessee State,
South Florida, and the University of
Alabama—Birmingham. Harris dis-
missed this notion, reminding reporters

season, prior to the Oct. 21 Boston
College game. Priestley was never at
full strength during the 2000 season
because of a shoulder injury that he suf-
fered against Miami toward the end of
the 1999 season.

It was duringthe 1999 season that
Priestley showed signs of greatness,
when he threw for 375 yards against
Rutgers and 407 yards against Virginia
Tech. 0 ’

Priestley" was unable to get com-, -
I fortable last season as-he was pulled

from games on several occasions for

not executing the offense the way coach

Harris had wanted. Priestley said that

-4 i_t’s a big load off of his shoulders now
that he knows that he is the No.1 guy.

“You don’t want to try to do too
much,” he said. “It’s OK to punt and
play defense and then give it another
go.” a

“He knows in his head that he’s_a .
senior and that this is his team,” Harris‘

said. “He’s just ‘got to put it together and

there’s no reason why he shouldn’t.”
Behind Priestley is the talented Rod

backer. Smith’s personal motivation
for this season is to fully recover from
off-season surgery.

“Every time I think about shutting
down [during practice], I think about
how hard itiwas coming back,” said
Smith, who had two disks removed
from his back, forcing him to miss
spring drills. A

As for the ends as a whole, Smith
says they have one goal——“to be dom-
inant in Big East.”

Defensive ends coach Curtis Bray
thinks his veteran starters are on the
right track to achieve that goal.

“They picked up right where they
left off in the spring and the fall,” Bray
said.

“We’re just trying to refine their
techniques and all their blitzes.”

Kevin Harris and Thomas Smith
are true freshmen joining more.experi-

enced players Brandon Hayes, Brian .

Guzek, Claude Harriot, George Peslis
and Matt Singleton on an experienced-
depth chart.

Expect to see Guzek and Harriet

rotated frequently as both saw play in
all 11 games last season.

Defensive tackles

With the graduation of starter
Mike White and with the move of
Penny Semaia to the offensive line,
nose tackle is the only position on the
defense that lacks experience.

But with plenty of talent to go
around on the defense, a large rotation
of players may be used at the tackle
spots. Joe Conlin (6 feet 5 inches, 290
pounds) could see time at both tackle

spots, while Darrell McMurray (6 feet
4 inches, 295 pounds) is looking to be
the other starter. Vince Crochunis, Dan
Stephens and Jake Holthaus are all in
the mix as well.

Troy Banner, a highly touted
recruit from nearby Penn Hills, could
also make an immediate impact as a
true freshman.

Linebackers

Pitt’s linebacker corps is probably
the deepest and most experienced on
the defense. All of the impact players
returned. ', ,

Amir Purifoy and Ryan Gonsales
are battling for the starting spot at Inid—
dle linebacker, but both seniors will
see a lot of playing time. Purifoy
rapped up 81 tackles, good for second
on the team, which included a season-
high 12 tackles against Virginia Tech.
Gonsales ranked fifth on the team in
tackles with 57.

Preseason All-American Gerald
Hayes will be at strong-side linebacker
after his breakout season last year.
Hayes, who earned All—Big East hon-
ors last season, led the team with 104
tackles, in just 10 regular season
games. His most dominating perfor-
mance came against Syracuse when he
stopped 16 ball carriers.

Brandon Williams and Brian
Beinecke will likely share duties at
weak-side linebacker. Williams, who
played tailback during his first two

‘seasons, excelled at his new position,

collecting 49 tackles. Beinecke is a
ball hawk. He played in all 11 games
last season, while compiling 52 tack-

Priestley enters hisfinal

year at quarterback

Offense, page 70

Francisco 49ers in the third round, leav-
ing a big void to be filled. Currently the
most experienced tailbacks are redshirt
freshman Malcolm Postell and true
freshman Mike Jemison.

Jemison, who graduated from high
school early, participated in winter
drills and spring practice. He rushed for
23 yards on four carries and had a 46-
yard reception in the Blue/Gold game.

Also joining the fray are Darren
McCray, James Johnson, Raymond
Kirkley, Tim Murphy and Abdur
Abdullah. Harris has said it’s possible
that fullbacks Lousaka Polite and
Dustin Picciotti could see playing time
at tailback if none of the young backs
step up.

Polite, a redshirt sophomore,
showed that he was capable of pound-
ing the defense through his hard run-
ning and that he could catch the ball out
of the backﬁeld last season, during his
freshman year. Picciotti, a_ 6-foot-3
inch, 255-pound tank, felt the lingering
effects of a concussion suffered during
the Big 33 Football Classic (high school
all—star game), which hampered his
opportunity to gain on-the-ﬁeld experi-
ence. He played mostly on special
teams last season. 1

“The fullbacks are experienced and
tl1ey’ll probably feel the biggest wrath
of wearing the new guys in,” Simms
said. .

Simms took over as the running
backs coach’ in February after Kenny.
Carter went to Penn State. Simms has
coached at Rutgers, Ohio State, Toledo
and Illinois. '

It’s no secret that the running back
position, along with the offensive line,
is the biggest concern, coming into the
season. _

“We have some good athletes,”
Harris said of the freshman backs. “We
have no choice but to ﬁnd three or four
players that will respond to coach
Sims and get done what we need them
to do.”

Brookhart said that Jemison and
Postell should have the edge going into
the season but that they still have things
to learn. Jemison said he believes that
he has a real advantage over the newer,
fresher faces.

“Getting a head start has given me
a big step ahead of everyone,” Jemison
said. “I’ve gotten the chance to get my
head right and none of these guys have
been popped by Ramon Walker or
Gerald Hayes yet.”

Harris thought that Kirkley,
Johnson and McCray had. separated
themselves from the other true -fresh-

man early in camp. -

“We have a lot of great backs and
we’re picking up just fine,” Picciotti
said.

Wide receivers

What can you say about Antonio
Bryant? He’s a Heisman Trophy candi-
date, a preseason All-American candi-
date, he was named by The Sporting
News and Lindy’s as the top receiver in
the nation and he was in Playboy.

He broke a Big East record with his
1,302 total receiving yards, grabbing 68
receptions and scoring 11 touchdowns.
Bryant averaged 19.2 yards per catch
and he is the only sophomore, other
than Randy Moss, to ever Win the
Biletnikoff. ‘ ' _

As the Big East" Conference’s tri-
offensive player of the year, he posted
222 receiving yards against: Boston
College, 212 yards against North
Carolina, 148 yards against West
Virginia and,127 yards and three touch-
downs against Virginia Tech.

Harris has made it no secret that he
wants Pitt to become “Wide Receiver
U” and it might just be after this season,
thanks to Bryant’s supporting cast.

Junior“ Lamar Slade will look to be
the primary bookend to Bryant. Slade
has a large presence on the ﬁeld, stand-
ing at 6 feet four inches, and he showed
signs that he could be a go-to guy, clos-
ing the 2000 season with six catches for
44' yards in the In'sight.com Bowl
against Iowa State. '

“Lamar Slade has really been an
important part of ourvscheme and he’s

Offensive line must fill
some unexpected holes

Offense, page 74

getting ready to take his game to anoth-
er level,” Harris said.

Adding more depth is 6-foot-3-
inch,' 215-pound senior R.J. English.
English had become an intricate part of
the offense last season before being
sidelined by a right knee injury. English
is known for his game—breaking speed
and aggressive style. In the 2000 open-
er against Kent State, English caught

‘ two balls for 128 yards, which included
an 80-yard score.

English had 15 catches for 326
yards in eight games, before sustaining
the knee injury in practice prior to the
Miami game.

“I’ve always been a fan of R.J.,”
Harris said. “He’s a very talented young
man. He just needs to believe in himself
more and handle adversity better.”

Another guy Harris said he is
counting on is senior Darcey Levy.
Until this season-, Levy had spent most
of his time on special teams returning
kicks. Levy runs one of the fastest 40-
yard dashes on the team. —

“He hasn’t done much yet but I
know he’s worked very hard and that’s
all I ask for as a coach,” Harris said.
“He’s got big-time speed and excellent
size.” - A

True‘ freshman Marcus Furman,
who was recruited as a rlmning back,
will also get a look at receiver, as he
asked Brookhart for the position
change. ‘

Brookhart plans to spread defenses
out with his deep receiving corps,

which should in turn, open up the run- '

ning game.

Tight ends

The man at tight end for the
Panthers is sophomore Kris Wilson.
The 6—foot—3-inch, 240—pound end
showed that he could be a dangerous
receiver during his redshirt freshman
campaign last year.

_ Wilson had a great spring. He was a
recipient of the Ed Conway Award,
which is presented armually to the most
improved players following spring
drills, where he caught a 62-yard touch-
down pass from Priestley in the
Blue/Gold game. .

He played in all 11 regular-season
games, making six starts. He caught
seven balls for a total of 127 yards and
two touchdowns. .

Wilson shared the starting tight end
duties last season with Mike ‘Bosnic,
who was moved to offensive tackle this
season. \‘

Another redshirt sophomore, Matt
Mefford, will join Wilson at tight end.

, The 6—foot—3-inch, 280-pound Mefford

played on the defensive line last season.
Brennan Carroll and Chris Curd
add depth to the position. Carroll, a

- senior, contributed sparingly, catching

three balls for 25 yards. Curd,~a sopho-

more, played mostly on special teams I

last season.

Offensive line

With center Jeff McCurley, the key-
stone of last year’s offensive line, lost
to graduation and starting tackle
Khiawatha Downey suspended for the

‘ season, there is a lot of competition on

the 2001 offensive line. .
There are very few jobs nailed

down on the line but Brian Anderson

will be the starting right guard and

Chad Reed will most likely be the start- -
‘ ing center. ‘ I

Anderson is massive, standing 6
feet 5 inches and weighing 310 pounds.
The redshirt junior has been a fixture on
the line for the past two seasons. He
played in all 11 games last season and

helped to pave the way for Barlow’s _

great season. ,
Reed, a 6—foot—3-inch, 290-pound

junior, started the last two games of the,

2000 season, when McCurley was
moved to left guard. He played in 10
regular season games and the
Insight.com Bowl.

“I love being in charge and that’s
the main responsibility of the center,”
Re_ed said. :“I think there’s pressure that

we’ve lost guys but our key guys are A

returning players.”
The other three positions are wide
open.

feet 6 inches, 330 pounds) and Dan
LaCarte (6 feet 4 inches, 285 pounds)

twill battle for left tackle spot, while

senior Mike Bosnic (6 feet 7 inches,
280 pounds) and redshirt sophomore

Matt Morgan (6 feet 7 inches, 295 _

pounds) vie for the right tackle position.
LaCarte switched from defensive

tackle to offensive tackle this spring. He ‘

played in four games last season. Petitti
impressed coaches during spring drills.

Bosnic makes the switch from tight
end, where he played along with Kris
Wilson, in 11 games last season.

Morgan stepped into the starting lineup-

at the beginning of last season, starting
the ﬁrst ﬁve games in place of Downey,
who was hampered with an ankle
injury.

Jon Schall (6 feet 4 inches, 295

pounds) returns at left guard, after earn- '

ing the starting role as _a true freshman
last season. Although Schall started in
10 games, Brookhart said that junior
Joe Manganello (6 feet 4 inches, 295
pounds) would give Schall competition
at the position.

2001 secondary is deep

Defense, page 72

les. ‘ ‘ _ '
“Most of the [linebackers] here got
a lot of playing time last year,”

I Beinecke said.

“We’re all used to playing with
each other, so we understand what
each other can do.”

A very talented group including
Lewis Moore, Scott McCurley, and
Nick Cole backs up the starters.
Beinecke said that he likes what he
sees in true freshman Monroe
Weekley. ?

“He’s a big, strong, athletic kid,”
Beinecke said. ‘

Moore has a big upside and was a
recipient of the Ed Conway Award,
which is given to the most improved
players following spring drills.

For motivation, Beinecke said the
linebackers _have to look no further
than Pitt’s loss to Iowa State in the
Insight.com Bowl last season.

“We didn’t win the bowl game,

and I think that’s what’s really moti- ‘

vating,” Beinecke said.

“You’ve got to go a whole year
just thinking about that. We have real-
ly high expectations for ourselves, so
we expect to progress rather quickly.”

Cornerback

Shawntae Spencer and Shawn
Robinson are the starters going into
the season, but they will have plenty of_

competition in a stacked position on ,

the defense.

Robinson led the team in intercep-
tions with six and passes ‘deﬂected
with 18. Spencer started eight games
as a true freshman, deﬂecting 15 pass-
es and intercepting two; »

Torrie Cox and William “Tutu”
Ferguson will see a lot of playing time.
Taron Gray, Ian Riddick, and freshman
Tez Morris round out a tough group.

Ferguson started two games last
season as a true freshman, tackling 45
opponents and intercepting two balls.

Cox said he’s benefited a lot from
Rhoads. ‘

“As long as I listen to him, every-
thing will go well,” he said. E

Cox also said the new recruits
have a lot to offer. “I’m mentoring a
lot, but some of the younger cats men-
tor me,” Cox said. “It goes both ways.”
Safety ‘

Junior Ramon Walker may be the
star of all stars on this talented
defense. A preseason Jim Thorpe
Award candidate for the nation’s top
defensive back, a preseason All-
American ﬁrst team, and the Sporting
News No. 3 Free Safety nationally,
Walker is poised to have a monster
year. . _ , .
Backup Corey Humphries stepped
up big when Walker was out of the
lineup last year with shoulder prob-
lems.

Senior Mark Ponko, a member of
the Big East All-Academic Football
Team, is looking‘ to be the starter at
strong safety, sharing time with Gary
Urschler and Tyrone Gilliard. ‘

Ponko ranked fourth on the team.

as he speared opposing offenses for 71
tackles. Urschler, a junior, jumped into

S the lineup against North Carolina and

disrupted the Tarheels’ offense by
racking up 16 stops.

While there may be a number of
A1l—Americans on ‘his defense by
year’s end and while the freshmen may
prove to be the best class in a decade,
Rhoads doesn’t get caught up in all the
honors and doesn’t want his team to
either. _ . °

“We have no heroes,” Rhoads said.
“We don’t put anybody on a pedestal.

We ask all 11 that are on the ﬁeld to do

their job.”

Football coaches
Big East, page 68 I V E

that last’ season UAB beat Louisiana
State University, East Carolina, and
Southern Mississippi, and that Pitt
recruits in South Florida so “there are
going to be a lot of good football play-
ers on that ﬁe1d.” ' _
“They are three teams that heading,
into the season _we’re deﬁnitely sup-
posed to beat,” Reed said. “I’m per-
sonally not going to take any of them
lightly because no matter who you
beat, if you lose one of those games it
doesn’t mean anything.” _
Teams in the Big East are not about “
to take Pitt lightly either, _as_ coaches T
and players agreed that it is a gifted

gather for media

team.

“Pitt has a great team, they played _
‘us tough last year,” said Temple quar-
terback Devin Scott. “They have ' a

great defense and they are talented. on
offense. It’s going to be a good game.”

After losing at Pitt last season,
O’Brien is. relieved that this year’s
match up will be played on the Eagles’
home ﬁeld. Syracuse’s Graham Manley
mentioned that in the preseason, Pitt
has been ranked fairly high in a number
of magazines, and while David Pugh of
Virginia, Tech had kind words to say

about the Panther team, he also had to A

hold himself back with what were per-
haps his true feelings saying, “I don’t

»_ want to get myself in trouble now.”
