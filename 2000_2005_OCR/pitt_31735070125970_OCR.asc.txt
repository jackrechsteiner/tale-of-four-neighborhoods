“Thispwas not my fault,” wails one
woman. '

.“If he hitsyou once," he’ll hit you A A
again,” says another.

“I’m a victim too, we need to stick
together,” says a third.
This is not a literal conversation

,_amongvwomen. And the women aren’t

actually speaking —— their T—shirts are.

' This week, Campus Women’s
Organization is“ sponsoring The
Clothesline Project. To raise domestic
Violence awareness, as well as to bear
witness to women who have suffered
through it, the project displays T—shirts

made by survivorsof Violence and their?

supporters.

The Clothesline Project is on dis-
play in the Conney M. Kimbo Art
Gallery on the main floor of the
William Pitt Union through Sunday.

“Every single one of the shirts is a
personal testimony,” said CWO Vice
President Courtney Caudill. “Seeing
them together,‘from all walks of life, is
so powerful.”

Teresa Caruso, a 1977 Pitt graduate, surveys the T-shirts hanging in the Conney
M. Kimbo Art Gallery as part of The Clothesline Project exhibit.

CWO is sponsoring the event in
conjunction with a local» women’s shel-
ter and Lazarus department stores.
Lazarus donated the T—shirts, the major-
ity of which were designed by women

at the shelter. Pitt students contributed
30 shirts to the display.
. Alison Bodenhemier, a CWO offi-

cer, stenciled domestic violence statis-

tics onto a yellow T—shirt. According to

 

Kimbo ilery xhit fits to a T

her shirt, four women are battered every
day.

“The statistics blow my mind,”
Bodenhemier said. _ ‘

Begun in 1990 by a group of
women in Hyannis, Mass., The
Clothesline Project got its name
becauseof the way the shirts are dis-
played.

According to Caudill the founders
of the project felt that a Clothesline, a
symbol of domesticity, should be juxta-
posed against the T—shirts of those sub-
jected to violence in the domestic
realm. The women began the project
after uncovering a statistic indicating
that more women died as a result of
domestic violence than men killed in
the Vietnam War during the same time
frame.

Every shirt is unique and personal
in its own way. Some are covered in
pictures, others in quotes or prayers;
some tell stories.

“The T—shirts give credence to the
fact that the victims are actual people,”
CWO President Andrea DeChellis said.
“With this project, they’re no longer
just a number.”

 Pitt’s Spanish department is saying

~ . “hasta la vista” to its three—track major.

The department is restructuring
the language, literature and self-
designed tracks, combining them as

 - part of the new Spanish major.

f‘We will have a new, more dynam-

' ‘A’ ic major that can interact in a better

way,” said Mabel Morana, department
chair of Hispanic languages and litera-
ture. .
According to Morana, the Spanish

department is trying to update the

major in order to make students more

 marketable and to clear up any confu-

sion asto how the three tracks are dif-
ferent. -
While many members of the

Spanish department to  
restructure major tracks .

Spanish department are excited about
the change, many Spanish students are
unhappy with it. Whitney Crockford, a
sophomore Spanish language major, is
upset that she can no longer major
specifically in language.

"‘I want the guaranteed education
that I signed up for,” she said.

According to Morana and John
Beverly, the director of undergraduate
studies, all students majoring in one of
the three Spanish tracks or who are

planning to declare one of the tracks

this semester or next, will have the
opportunity to complete their studies.
The tracks will be slowly phased out
over the next four years.

According to Aston, two" of the
most significant collections are the
Nietz Old Textbook Collection and the

tArchives of Scientiﬁc Philosophy in

the Twentieth Century.

Dr. John A. Nietz was a professor
from Pitt’s School of Education, and
during his tenure here he collected
many textbooks from before 1900. He
used these texts to teach his students
how textbooks were written before the
20th century.

When Nietz retired in 1958, he
donated his entire collection to Pitt.
Forty—three years later the collection
has 16,000 volumes, and 30 of those

Future lawyers investigate law school t fr

~ MELANIE DONAHOO
‘ Staff Writer

From Albany to Yeshiva, Widener to

Brooklyn, more than 30 law schools came ‘

to the Law School Fair yesterday after-

noon.

Sponsored by Placement and Career
Services and held in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom, the fair gave students the oppor-
tunity to talk to different law schools and

' have their questions about admissions and
academics answered.

Alexis Nutter, a junior political science
and psychology student, came to the fair to
ﬁnd out what she had to do to get into law
school.

“I talked to my school of choice,
Temple University, and found out I am a
good potential candidate for admission,”
she said.

Recruiters identiﬁed good students as
those who have done well in undergraduate
school and are looking to further their edu-
cation.

“We’re not looking for any particular
major,” said Eric Kniskem, associate direc-
tor for admissions at VV1dener University
School of Law. “We're looking for hard
workers.”

Lanine Baccam, an admission coun-
selor for the University of Denver College
of Law also said she is not looking for a

“We’re looking for a diverse student
body,” she said. “For students with all types
of backgroun .”

Although many students came to
explore their options, many seniors turned
out to gather their application materials and
start the admissions process.

“The courtroom really attracts me,”
said Julie Utberg, a senior history major.
“I’d like to try cases and to perform.”

According to Trisha Crowe, special
events coordinator for Placement and
Career Services, this is the ﬁrst year a fair
has been devoted entirely to law schools. In
the past, Pitt has instead hosted a graduate
and professional school fair.

Crowe explained that all schools have
a recruiting schedule and they are especial-
ly interested in seeking a student body with
diverse geographical backgrounds.

‘.‘We hope that all students’ geographic
interests are located here as well,” Crowe
said.

Crowe and law school adviser
Elizabeth Rychcik said they hope all stu-
dents start exploring their career path early.
Angela Davis, alumni ambassador for
Hofstra University School of Law, said she
was pleased with the students who turned
out.

“The student body has been very
mature,” she said. “They know what direc-

ﬂ‘O’s hot dogs ranked fourth

NATALIE REID
The Pitt News

 - . Most students who stop into the
‘Original Hot Dog Shop to grab‘ a quick
_ meal don’t realize that they’re not just eat-
"'i1I’g at the best hot dog place in Oakland,

.54

but that they’re dini_ng at one of the
"well. _
 In the armual restaurant -issue of
2; Gourmet Magazine, the “O” is ranked as

 States.

tt,§\ics,Jane,-'and Michaeljstem. “On _the side,

legendary —-_crisp and dark gold, with ‘a

Owner Sidney Simon said he was
pleased, but not surprised, at receiving the
honor. According to Simon, since its

, opening in 1960, numerous magazine and
newspaper articles and even television

I specials have featured the “O.”

i Simon said he only bought two
copies of the magazine and declined a
salesperson’s offer to frame the article.
Simon said that if he were to hang up all
of the coverage “the walls would be cov-
ered.”

What Simon is most proud of is not
the awards, but that his restaurant is
regarded as a Pittsburgh landmark.

“People driving through on vacation, ,

especially those who used to live in the
area, come to Oakland just to see if the
‘O’ is still aroun ” he said.

, But the restaurant's recognition is not
"limited to the United States. After trying
his hot dogs, people from all over the
world beg him to ship crates to their
homes. Simon added that while in Rome

An employee at the “O” dishes up
some celebrated dogs.

years ago, he was surprised to spot a
tourist wearing the famous Original Hot
Dog Shop T-shirt. '

“I couldn’t believe it. I had to go over
and tell him I was the owner,” he said.

Because of ‘the Gourmet Magazine
ranking, Simon expects that his already
popular restaurant will draw even more
customers who want to experience the
award-winning fare. -

Veteran customers like sophomore
Julie Turka continue to eat at the “O” usu-
ally for lunch and after hours. Although

she hadn’t heard about the ranking, Turka .

said that anytime a business in Oakland
receives positive attention, it’s good for
the campus. .

“It’s nice to have a place like this,

where college students and doctors hang"

out, mentioned in a nationally read maga-
zine,”  said.

More feel good about
government, but few
want to work for it 1

STEPHEN BARR

The Washington Post
WASHINGTON —— While
Americans hold more positive

views of the government after the

Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the shift

hasn’t translated into much greater
interest in working for the govern-
ment, according to a survey.

Only 18 percent of survey

‘ respondents said their interest in

federal employment has increased
since the attacks, and 80 percent
said their interest in a federal job
remained the same or declined, the
survey found.

Many college-educated
Americans appear to reject the gov-
ernment as a prospective employer.
Just one in _six college-educated
workers expressed significant inter-
est in working for the government.

The survey results were
released Tuesday at the launch of a
new nonprofit group, the
Partnership for Public Service,
financed by a $25 million gift from
Connecticut businessman Samuel
Heyman. He said his interest in
public service began when he got
his first job out of Harvard Law
School -4 at the Justice Department
during the Kennedy administration.

The nonpartisanx ‘ group
describes itself as “dedicated to
revitalizing the public service” -and
seeks legislation making it easier

. for the government to attract :}and

The" launch featured two.
makers who are public service
advocates —— Sen. George
Voinovich, R-Ohio, and Rep.
Constance Morella, R-Md. They
promised to introduce legislation to

keep high-quality employees. 
’ 2 law-

ease the government’ s “human cap- V

ital crisis.”

Their legislation would speed
the federal hiring process, establish
a “chief human capital officer” in
agencies and ‘create a “Chief

Human Capital Officers Council”
for the government.

Nearly 20 percent of civil ser-
vants are expected to retire during
the next five years, raising the
prospect of skill shortages in.the

government.

Max Stier, president of the
Partnership for Public Service, said
the survey “reveals the difficulty of
the road ahead. We apparently
appreciate government workers, but
we still don’t want to be them.”

The polling team of Peter Hart
and Robert Teeter conducted
national telephone surveys in
August and October and found a
dramatic shift in the public’ s Views
toward government after the Sept.
11 attacks.

A whopping 91 percent said the
government has functioned very or
fairly well following the attacks.
Sixty-eight percent said they now
think of the federal government as
“our government,” up from 42 per-
cent in August. The percentage who
think of government as a distant,

‘unresponsive institution declined

from 55 percent in August to 30
percent in October, Hart said.

When asked about the govern-
ment" s recruitment and retention
shortfalls, 73 percent agreed that
they were very serious or fairly
serious problems. a

Only -16 percent of college
graduates and 17 percent of profes-
sionals and managers said they’dbe
interested in working for the gov-
ernment. College graduates believe
private-sector jobs offer more inter-
esting and challenging work than
the government and are more likely
to reward outstanding performance‘.
By an overwhelming margin, the
public sees Working for a nonprofit
group as a better way to contribute

to society and help people, Hart "

said.
Hart also found‘ that young
adults (18 to 29) are more open to

the idea of government service and A

rate the quality of federal jobs high-
er than do workers 30 and older.
Those attitudes represent an open-
ing for federal recruiters, Hart sug-
gested. - ‘
Survey respondents favored
expanded recruitment efforts on
college campuses, a faster and sim-

pler job application process, more

competitive salaries and a student
loan forgiveness program.

Library collections draw scholars from around the world

Hillnian, page 1

volumes can be downloaded from the
Hillman Library Web page.

“Nowadays people doing modern
research in social history and cultural
history are looking into schoolbooks as
evidence of cultural perceptions,’ cul-
tural viewpoints, social viewpoints and
social attitudes ‘cause schoolbooks
tend to demonstrate that,” Aston said.

“There are 16,000 of them that
look like this,” Aston said holding up a
battered copy of a 19th century Early
Reader primer.

“They don’t look like much, but
what is amazing is that there are so
many that survived,” he said. “We are
still acquiring them. They are a record
of publishing in the United States dur-
ing that time period.”

If theNietz Collection is important

e for the English and history major, then

the Archives of Scientific Philosophy
in the Twentieth Century serve as a
database for what a Pitt brochure of the
same name calls a “legacy of this cen-
tury’s most important philosophical
movement.” -

Students worry
about Spanish
major changes

Spanish, page 1 ‘ .

the literature programs and weakening
the language ones,” said Sonia Lenk, a

Spanish graduate student. Lenk said _

her main concern is that the quality of
teaching will decline in the language
program. The new major would call

‘ for only three faculty members to
0 teach all linguistics classes.

Beverly and Morana explained
that there will be enough faculty to
staff the courses, and the quality of th
teaching will not suffer. ‘

“There’s a misconception that this
-is a dramatic change,” Beverly said.
“It won’t be, the old requirements are
still there.”

Morana stated that the Spanish
department has tried to communicate
the benefits of the new major to its
students, despite rumors about the
changes. _

“How can you advance if you

I, don’t change?” Morana said. “[The

students] will love it when they see
it.” *

Beverly and Morana said that
although the changes are imminent, no
formal decision or announcement has
been made about when they will be
instituted.

This collection houses manu-
scripts, notes and unpublished mem-
oirs from such notable scientists as
Hans Reichenbach and Ludwig

‘Wittgenstein. In addition, this collec-

tion also has manuscripts and docu-
ments on the subject of quantum
mechanics by such notable scientists as

Albert Einstein and Erwin
Schrodinger.
“People come from Europe,

England, Germany,‘ Italy, France and
all over this country to do research
here,” he said.

Aston said that some of the docu-
ments, including journal entries and

manuscripts, wouldn’t be revealed to
the public until the relative or donor
passes away, because of the sensitive
nature of some of these manuscripts. _
Beside these two collections, Pitt
also houses 20 other collections, that
are stored in a room with a special-air
conditioner that produces 70—degree air
with a 50 percent relative humidity.
Older books dated pre—l700s are stored
in special “clam shields” or hinge cases
to protect them from the environment.
Books that need to be repaired are sent
to a special facility in North Carolina.
Aston shows a complete set of the
second edition Oxford World

Dictionary from the 19th century with
new forest green binding.

“They couldn’t duplicate the origi-
nal binding, that would be to expen-
sive. But I think they still did do a good
job,” he said. The dictionaries are one
of the few items that are not stored in
the special air—conditioned back room.
They are available for anyone interest-
ed in 19th century words and defini-
tions.

“People have described thespecial
collection as a treasure trove, and
there’s truth to that statement,” Aston

said. “They are treasures for you don’t V

find them anywhere.”

Too young to vote but notto die?

Two nights ago, Texas executed
Gerald Mitchell. Although he was 33 years
old at the time of his death, he was 17
when he killed two people and attempted
to kill a third.

At age 17, you cannot vote. You can-
not serve in the military. You carmot drink.
You cannot even smoke.

But in Texas, Pennsylvania and 21
other states, society can kill you.

These states do not believe 17-year-
olds are responsible enough to understand
the consequences of their decisions to
choose representatives, serve in the mili-
tary, drink and smoke. But they do believe
a 17-year-old can understand the conse-
quences of killing someone. , .

This should not be surprising. Too
often, we’re considered responsible
enough for burdens before we are for
rights. ~-
This has been particularly true in the

_ juvenile justice system during the last two

decades. As get-tough-on-crime legislation
has advanced, states have shifted their
juvenile justice emphasis from rehabilita-
tion to punishment.

But it has not been the same in all
states. If Mitchell had been in one of the 15
states whose minimum execution age is 18
or if he’d been in one of the 12 states that
do not execute, he would have received a
prison sentence. '

Nothing justiﬁes what Mitchell did.
Two people are dead as a result of his

actions, a third person’s life is permanent-
ly altered and Mitchell’s victims’ families
may never recover. He should have at least
spent a long time — if not the rest of his nat-
ural life — in prison. He had to face conse-
quences for his actions.

But the law says that children should
not face the same consequences as adults
would, since they do not have the same
capacity to understand those. Although one
could argue that a 17-year-old has that
capacity, the law considers someone a
minor in all other aspects untilage. 18. It
should be the same for punishment.

Most of the world says so. In fact,
according to the Children’s’ Defense Fund,
only two other countries —‘shining beacons
of human rights like Iran and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo — have
executed juvenile offenders in the last
three years.

The United States is one of two coun-
tries — the other being Somalia, a country
virtually wiﬂiout a government — that has
not ratiﬁed the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child because it bans execut-
ing juvenile offenders.

Mitchell spent almost half his life on
death row, and those who knew him say he
had changed in that time. While this does
not justify his release from prison, it also
does not justify his death. He could have
made a positive contribution to society,
even from within prison walls. Now soci-
ety will never know.

‘Love’ doesn’t justify ill treatment

How often do you hear one of your

friends say, “He’s such a jerk  but I love 4

him!”?

Does “love” in this case mean
accepting the "‘I was drunk, I didn’t know
what I was doing” excuse for the 
weekend in a row? Does it mean pre-
tending not to notice when your
boyfriend smokes up before your sorori-
ty formal, despite your request that for
just one day he not smoke

willing to be treated badly, plenty of guys
out there will be happy to oblige you.

I know from experience. Anytime I
tell a story about one guy I dated in high
school, it inevitably ends with “and then
we got into a big fight.” Whether it was a
church ski trip, the cast party after my
musical or an excursion to Cedar Point,
nearly any timel spent with him con-
cluded with a traumatic argument.

I At the time Ijthought I

pot?

Some people I know are
actually, in relationships like
this and worse. They talk
about fighting with their
boyfriends, about how
mean they are — and then
excuse it by talking about ‘
“love.”

What kind of “love” is
that? I know many intelli-

was utterly in love, so I dealt
with the constant bickering.
But now I realize that rela-
tionship had more to do with
drama than “love.”

The reason I stayed in-
that relationship for so long
was my lack of self-respect. I
did not respect
enough to tell him that his
constant criticism was really

gent, capable women who

deal with behavior from their boyfriends
that they would never tolerate from
friends — and then they pass it off as
“love.” :

Perhaps the drama creates excite-
ment. But this drama also keeps these
girls in bad relationships. .

If your boyfriend makes you cry
more than he makes you laugh, if he only
tells you you’re beautiful when he’s ‘try-
ing to make up for forgetting your birth-

day, then it’s not love— and a person can

only take so much drama.

Relationships arenot mandatory. No 9
law says you must have a boyfriend or 

girlfriend at any given point in your life.

"So if your ‘relationship + and signiﬁcant -
other —- don’t make your life better, why ‘

do you bother?
It really comes down to respect. Your

‘boyfriend will only treat you as well as

you treat yourself.'Trust_ me,-if you are

hurtful or that his demands to
know everything about my life invaded
my privacy. ' '

I stayed because I was not confident '

enough to demand better treatment.
Although I was never happy, I thought I
was “in love.”

The kind of «relationship that makes
you feel miserable all the -time, where

you’re preoccupied with avoiding the -

next argument or making up after the last
one, is a waste of time and emotional;
energy. - -

* So girls, take a serious look at your ;
relationships. If you’re spending all of e ‘

yourtime trying to resolve the latest con-

ﬂict, then perhaps .it’s_time to take off the
drama queen hat-and (gasp) ﬁnd yourself‘ “ ‘
'a guy who is actually good to you. ' '

Back in colonial times, when William Penn was
engaging in a hot Amish love fest, I’m sure he was
totally unaware that some 300 years later he would
ruin a lone college student’s life. '

Pennsylvania’s laws that were formed way back
in the good old days still seem to stand

What’s wrong with that picture? From my point of
view, nothing at all. If you too would like to experi-
ence this kind of freedom, then I recommend leaving
this steaming pile of dog waste as soon as possible.

I also have some serious issues with those peo—'
ple stuck in another time and in a bad

a modern society. This commonwealth-

fashion state known as the Amish. I
don’t know exactly what their deal is,
but I know it involves wearing funeral
clothing, having long beards —, both-
men and women — and not using elec-
tricity. As far as I’m concerned, they’re
only good for two things: They bake a
wicked blueberry pie and they enter-

tain me when I’m drunk and never talk
back. Except on Sunday, because as we
know, we can’t drink on Sunday._

I think college students deserve to see a
little bit more than those annoying tassels on a strip-
per’s breasts. Thanks a lot, Mr. Penn.

That’s not my only complaint against this so-

called commonwealth. The laws here are so back--

ward that people just get used to them and don’t even
realize that they’re getting stupider. For example, the
liquor laws say that beer distributors and liquor
stores can’t be open on Sundays.

Why the hell not? Is it because Jesus doesn’t
want Pennsylvanians to get drunk and watch football
instead of going to church? I don’t remember that in
the Bible anywhere. If Pennsylvania is going to
insist on state-run liquor establishments, it should at
least not run them on churches’ rules.

On an average Sunday back in New York, I
would go into a convenience store at noon, buy a 12-
pack of beer and get drunk in the back of a church.

Without getting too deep into’ the
asinine language of this commonwealth, I will just
say this: Many Pennsylvanians speak as though
they’ve had no education. Here’s a crash course in
what the rest of us call the English language: There
is no such thing as a hoagie. Pop is not a drink —. it’s
what you call your father. And anyone who speaks
this mockery of the English language called
“Pittsburghese” should be promptly and repeatedly
kicked in the groin. Next time I hear about a guy
going “dahn” on his girlfriend, I’m going to punch
him in the face.

A lot of things need to be changed in this com-
monwealth. Notice that in the last sentence I said, “to
be.” For those of you who failed out of your Amish
farmhouse English class‘, it’s known as an infinitive.
It connects words in a thought together — try using it ’
sometime. Next time someone tells me that “this

In the wake of the
attacks on Sept. 11, the
stem cell research — a hot

much so? When the debate gained

topic before then — has
faded into the back-
ground. Over the summer,
those who debated it
greatly oversimplified the
issue, focusing on
whether the embryos were

It is easy to forget the

    

Ed ilr

steam, many conserva-
tives placed a high
worth on the embryos’
lives.

This rests on the
assumption that the
embryos being utilized
for the research have the
potential to become
human beings. But many

Instead, we must_explore the avail-
able options to cure our fellow
Americans. They deserve that much.
Life is hardly as black and white
as political debates make it out to
be. There are many issues that we
must address aside from the ques-
tion of when human life starts.

Few conservatives are protest-
ing this “mass murdering” of inno-
cent cell cultures. Why not, you
may ask? These cells were not cre-
ated for the purpose of destruction,
but instead to allow otherwise infer-
tile parents to create life — a process
known as in vitro fertilization.

If one argues against using these
embryos for stem cell research, then
logically that person would also
have to argue against their

inevitable destruction — and further-
more against in vitro fertilization as
a whole, since it cannot‘ be effective
without/ creating excess embryos.
By arguing against what they con-
sider death, they argue against life.
Not only are they arguing
against the creation of life for infer-
tile women — giving these women
the joy of childbirth — but also
against a line of research that may
improve or even save countless
lives. Problems like A1zheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, cancer, stroke, heart
disease,"-the lack of suitable organs
fortransplant and many other prob-
lems may fade into the past if we
allow this research to ﬂourish. '
Some say we can avoid this
whole issue by using adult, instead
of embryonic, stem cells. But this is

-not a suitable way to resolve the

debate. Adult stem cells are present
in minute quantities, which makes,
finding enough for research purpos-
es difficult. Also, these cells may
have genetic defects from exposure
to everydayliving and have a limit-
ed capacity to change into special-

ized cells, such as red blood cells,
neurons, muscle cells and so ‘forth.
-Yet the ability’ of stem cells to
change into many other types of
cells is what. makes their use vital in
research.‘ Embryonic stem cells
unquestionably h-ave this ability.
And so, with no other way
around the issue of using embryonic

stem cells in research, we must ask‘

ourselves if the 1ife—saving potential
of a small cluster of cells created to
give life to infertile couples is

worth more than the “lives” of" these .
cells on the inevitable path to,_

destruction. ‘

never know how many people this

The Dalai Lama offers tips for compassion

An Open Heart: Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life

More than 20,000 people gathered in
Central Park. They were not protesting.
They were not part of a political rally, nor
were they taking part in a memorial service.
Rather, the people came together to attend a
course on compassion.

Traveling all the way from India, the
Dalai Lama taught the course. As spiritual
leader of Tibetan Buddhism, 1989 Nobel
Peace Prize recipient and outspoken advo-
cate for a nonviolent campaign to free Tibet
ﬁom Chinese rule, the Dalai Lama was more
than qualiﬁed to speak on this topic.

Although he gave the talk more than
two years ago on Aug. 15, 1999, those who
oouldn’t attend can still learn what the Dalai
Lamahadto say. The book“An Open Heart:
Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life” is
based on that talk —

Written by the Dalai Lama and edited
by the Buddhist monk Nicholas Vreeland,
thebookismorethanatranscriptofthetalk
It explains the origin of Buddhism and the
plight of the Tibetan people. Although brief,
this information presented in the book’s fore-
word is clear and extremely helpful in

explaining a faith that is foreign to many

people. ,
The book focuses on the application of

Buddhist teachings rather than the history of
Buddhism. In many ways, it is aimed at non-
Buddhists. It attempts to give people an
understanding of Buddhism and to share the
techniques that Buddhists use to incorporate
compassion, happiness and wisdom into
their own lives. Non-Buddhists do not have
to convert to Buddhism in order to beneﬁt
from its teachings.

The material is dense, but it is written in
a clear and simple manner. It attempts to
explain some extremely diﬁicult and abstract
concepts -— concepts that Buddhist monks
have dedicated their entire lives to under-
standing.

On the other hand, many of the teach-
ings are  For example, the Dalai
Lama stresses the fact that one who harbors
feelings of hostility toward another will only
hurt him or _herself. Happiness oornes about

as generating Bodhicitta, “the altruistic mind

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE

Almost instantly recognizable stylistically as
one of modern cinema’s more effective teams, it has
been six years since brothers/co-directors Allen and
Albert Hughes have released a feature length ﬁlm.

Their ﬁrst, “Menace II Society,” won praise for
its unﬂinching portrayal of violence in Los
Angeles’ Watts District, while their sophomore

Vietnam are covering pre-, during and post—war
struggles. “Presidents” was effective on some fronts
but ultimately fell short, attempting to cover too
much ground.

Their latest, a take on the Jack the Ripper -H

myths, certainly seems like an appropriate career
direction. But despite their impressive visual ﬂair,
“From Hell” suffers from a lack of focus, revealing
the brothers’ weakness in developing multi-layered
plotlines. Once again, they’ve spread themselves
too thin, leaving us without a single story to walk
away with, despite some genuinely gruesome set-
pieces. .

“From Hell” is by no means a mindless slasher
ﬂick. But then, it’s not just a period piece either.
Based_on Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell’s graph-
ic novel of the same name, its comic book origins

Songs in Fred and Gray

Suzanne Vega
‘A&M Records

 -' Five’ years after her last album,

 Suzanne Vega returns to music with her
'- bestalbum in more than a decade with

Songs in Red and Gray. She’s lost the
husband/producer who virtually
destroyed Nine Objects of Desire and
99.9° F and finally made another record
where the production is worthy of her
songwriting.

For years now, Vega had been vio-
lating the cardinal rule of musicians
who can’t help writing folk music -
she was overproduced. Her ex—husband,
Mitchell Froom, should not have been
producing for a fundamentally folk

musician. His sound cluttered hers;
frankly, it often sounded ridiculous. But
in Songs in Red and Gray, Vega said in

, the linernotes that she is returning to
the acoustic guitar and careful lyric

writing.
For analbum that is supposed to be

‘Vega’s, return to the acoustic guitar, it
certainly” does not return to her folk
‘ roots. This album is still produced, but

finally the production fits her. It’s mod-
ern but acoustically based.

Lyrically, Vega has proven to be a
poet once again, which is a good thing
since she’s spent the last few years
releasing books of poetry in every
country except the United States. The
standout track, “Widow’s Walk,” talks
with poetic candor abouther divorce.

“Consider me a widow boys, and I will

tell you why/It’s not the man, but it’s
the marriage that was drowned,” she
sings.

on Su.zar1r‘t-'_e_ —-—-.— s 
are you running. awe 
from-.

 

Having a divorce to cope with does
Vega’s music well. Perhaps she was
simply too happy when she made the
previous two records; she was married
to a successful producer, had a daughter
and lived in relative obscurity in the
United States while she sold plenty of
records internationally. In the five—year
time that her marriage -went sour, she

-whipped up some really poignant poet-

ry. When Vega sings, “If you were a
weapon/a hammer’s what you’d be/
blunt and heavy at the end/and coming
down on me,” we feel her pain.

It’s a cliche, but Vega has dropped
the man and reclaimed her voice. The
music is good again. Back in the day,
Vega gained popularity by writing
songs that had an unusual urgency to
them. People reacted to the plight of the
characters in her songs. Finally, she’s
back. ‘

was

When you attend a concert headlined
by Pittsburgh’s very own Clarks, you are
in for a treat. Not only do you receive
your money’s worth, you also receive a
terrific live performance from a hard-
working road band that enjoys what they
do.

The road warriors of the Pittsburgh
rock scene, The Clarks, re—released their
live album, simply titled The Clarks Live,
on Oct. 9.

Originally released in 1998, it has
been digitally remastered and reprinted
under their new label, Razor & Tie
Records.

The CD was recorded live at Nick’s
Fat City on Sept. 18 and 19,1998, and in
front of a sold—out crowd of 8,000
screaming fans at I.C. Light
Amphitheatre, on July 20, 2001. The live
sound is a great addition to the CD col-
lections of both new and old Clarks fans.

The live album supplies the die—hard
Clarks fan with all of the classics that
have helped blaze a path for the once
“will play for beer” local band. The band
has included on the album songs that
every Clarks fan loves, such as
“Mercury,” “Caroline,” “Cigarette” and
the ever—popular “ Penny on the Floor.”

The band has also included a cover
of the Prince song “Kiss.” And for the
newer fans, three songs from the latest

release Let It Go have been included:
“Bom Too Late,” “Snowman” and
“Better Off Without You.”

, The band members of ‘The Clarks
attended Indiana ‘University of
Pennsylvania and are Pittsburghnatives.
When they were starting out, they played
small house parties for cases of beer, but
have since become known throughout
not only their home state but throughout
the East Coast and in the Midwest as
Well. '

The re-release is promotion for the
band’s new CD they’re currently record-
ing in Nashville, and is set for a spring
2002 release.

If for some reason you attend this
University and have yet to see The Clarks
in ‘concert, this album is a great way to
get to know and learn to love those good
old boys from Pittsburgh. _ .

Death Cab for Cutie:
With The Prom

Tonight, 7 p.m.

Millvale Industrial Theater
(412) 321-M|T|'

When Death Cab for Cutie takes the

stage at Millvale Industrial Theater tonight, *

prepare yourself for an evening of snapshots

and images of lost loves and bittersweet‘

memories. This isn’t your ordinary slide
show, though; the boys will show off some
of their favorites fromtheir Photo Album.
The Photo Album, Death Cab’s third
album, arrives shortly following 2000’s We
Have the Facts and We’re Voting Yes’ and
their ' l999 debut V Something About
Airplanes. The band,j‘who hails ﬁom the
Northwest, began as a one—man project by

now lead—voca]ist Ben Gibbard, but eventu— -

ally picked up Christopher Walla for guitar,
keys and vocal, Nicholas Harmer on bass
and Michael Schorr on drums. V
Snapshot one: The album opens with
the sweet and short “Steadier Footing”
where Gibbard narrates _ a ' 1ate—night
encounter on the front porch. He is “watch-
ing the drunks stumble forth into the night”
— sound familiar at all? Suddenly he sees

someone he knows and he ends uptalking

to her. He says, “And this is the chance I
never got/to make a move, but we just talk
about the people we’ve met in the last ﬁve
years/and will we remember them in 10
more?” Certainly you’ve had an experience
like this.

Snapshot two: Gibbard sings, “I inten-
tionally wrote it out to be an illegible
mess/you wanted me to write you letters,
but I’d rather lose your address.” You’ll
berate yourself for past slip—ups after listen-
ing to the repetitious “lnfomiation Travels



Faster.”

Snapshot three: Pull up to “Coney
Islan ” in December or January. It’s cold
and lonely, and you marvel at the fact that
six months earlier the amusement park was
hot and packed with people in shorts and T-
shirts. Sweeping, echoey pianos, bass and
synthetic beats stir you like a gust from the
Atlantic. “I can hear the Atlantic echo

back/roller coaster screams from summers
. past,” Gibbard wistfully recalls.

The Photo Album provides a perfect

soundtrack to head into late fall and winter,

and despite their depressing and sometimes"

too—close—to—home lyrics, Death Cab for
Cutie will provide a comforting and hopeful
show tonight.

Deb Talan

Opening for Loudon Wainwright
III ’
Tomorrow, 7 p.m.
Rosebud

(412) 261-2221

The coffeehouse circuit can be a
grueling, unforgiving experience —for
musicians. Deb Talan, a veteran on the
open—mic scene, pulls it off with grace
and intelligence. Talan has the chance to
delight Pittsburghers when she takes the
stage at Rosebud Thursday night as an
opening act for Loudon Wainwright III.

Talan’s mix of indie, pop and folk is
nothing new. Shawn Colvin, Beth Orton
and Suzarme Vega have been mixing

these genres for years. Yet Talan brings '

something unique to this sometimes

overly sappy and brooding style of.

music —— her distinctive and infectious
melodies, accompanied by her unforget-
table voice. ,

Talan’s songwriting reads like poet-
ry. Her second album, Something
Burning, opens with a track called
“Thinking Amelia.” A She writes,
“Turning like a leaf in changing weath-
er/Feathering down to the earth/Like a
moonbeam come untethered/Chalk it up
to bad timing, bad signing/Maps are
misleading, are to be rnistrustedl Are no
two paths alike.”

With her introspective lyrics, it’s no
surprise to find Talan using Edna St.
Vincent Mi1lay’s poetry in the third
track, “Gladdest Thing.” Talan com-
bines lyrics from Mi1lay’s poem
“Aftemoon on a Hill” with her own
words to create a melancholy but sweet
tune. . I ‘

Talan writes about deeply personal
experiences like the excitement of a new
romance or the heartache of a harsh
breakup. She doesn’t lack a sense of

humor, though. In “My Favorite Coat,”

she pays tribute to a faithful friend, her-

overcoat. An unlikely companion, but
that’s just what you’d expect from
Talan. She’s unpredictableand always
fresh. -
Talan’s love of music started at age
10. She began writing songs, studying
clarinet and piano and composing scores
for local productions of Shakespeare. It
wasn’t until her senior year in college
that she picked up an acoustic guitar.
After fronting the Portland, Ore.-
based pop band Hummingﬁsh, Talan
moved to the Northeast to go solo. Her
ambitious plans have paid off. She
earned two Boston Music Award nomi-
nations for 2001 for Something Burning
and is already working on a studio
album to be released in the ‘spring of
2002. .
Talan’s vulnerable voice mixed with
her poetic lyrics is catchy and definitely
worth checking out.

Hellish, page 10

Hughes brothers’ style, that a comic-book feel would fit
the contours of their co—authorship to produce a truly
great, truly frightening update of these slayings.

And lest we forget, this is Jack the Ripper, icono-
graphic perpetrator of five unsolved murders of “unfor—
tunates” -—~ prostitutes — in turn of the century England.

Johnny Depp, who’s done a lot of these sorts of hor-
ror mysteries, stars as Abberline, the legendary beyond-
the—law police inspector called in by cynical partner
Peter Godley (former “Cracker” star Robbie Coltrane).

Abberline has an affinity for opium, and we see dur—'

ing his high a sixth sense about the women about to be
or recently killed. «None of this actually helps him solve
the case, though Depp, with a spot-on British accent,‘
brings a depth to his character that such script develop-
ments, a stock of dark investigatory cliches a la
“Manhunter” and “Angel Heart,” unfortunately cannot
back up. '

Heather Graham, glowing as central “unfortunate”
Mary Kelley, is not bad either, though in casting an
Irish-emigre‘ selling herself for money on the streets of
England, I’m not sure she would be my first choice. On
top of that, Kelley is inexplicably immune to dirt or mis-
treatment, whereas her fellow whores are repeatedly

beaten and humiliated, and of course hacked up one by -

one by the Ripper.

In the end, “From Hell’s” problem lies in its lack of _
’ consistency. In fact, amid so many storylines, it could be

argued that the film has no main plot at all.

Perhaps next time the Hughes brothers should try
something a little more centered, or at least work from a
script that is layered a bit more cohesively. For, despite
the effects’ the murder‘ scenes leave, the film as a whole
is muddledand muddied with the grit of inconclusive

, storytelling.

Volleyball stillionsistent

NATALIE KRASMAN
Staff Writer

The volleyball match was in its ﬁfth and deciding game,
and Pitt was losing 14-13 to the George Mason Patriots. As
the Patriots attempted to win game-point, Panthers’ head
coach Chris Beerman crouched down on one. knee, with a
hand placed over his mouth, acting as if he was praying for the
win.

His prayers were left unanswered as the ball fell just out
of the reach of middle hitter Dionne Hayden, allowing the
Patriots to sneak away with a 15-13 win. r

The Panthers looked devastated and Beerman appeared to
be disillusioned.

Pitt jogged off the court, retiring to its locker room, and
waited for the routine speech from Beerman.

But he never delivered the lecture.

He stayed behind, pacing up and down the Panthers’ side-
line a few times, muttered once to his assistant coaches," “I’ll
see you in practice tomorrow,” and disappeared out the side
entrance of Fitzgerald Field House.

“I didn’t want to talk to anybody after the loss, I just need-
ed to get away ﬁem unbalanced volleyball,” Beerman said.

Inconsistency has plagued the PanthersLperfor_mance all
season and demonstrated no signs of stopping last weekend as
they lost to George Mason on Sunday 3-2, but swept West
Virginia 3-0. ‘ ' .

3 George Mason 3, Pitt 2

Pitt (7-11 overall, 4-5 Big East) won just one of its last
seven ﬁve-game matches, a substantial setback for the
Panthers that Beerman attributes to veterans not producing at
key moments. . « '

The Panthers proved Beerinan’s theory —— experienced
juniors Carrie Norris and Hayden as well as senior Heather

Haff recorded disappointing single ﬁgures in kills against the '

Patriots. ,
But if the upperclassmen of Pitt volleyball don’t perform,
the inexperienced will. Sophomore Wendy Hatlestad had 27

kills and freshman Abby Fechhelm recorded 13 kills, along.

with Gini Ullery, who added 11 kills.

Gini Ullery returns a ball against George Mason on Sunday

three games to two. ' *

The Panthers “lined up in the first game using the 6-2
offense, but this strategy did not work against the Patriots,

who according to Beerman incorporate a European style that .

utilizes a slowed down, methodical attack. .

The Panthers kept the score .close, but Norris in the hit-
ter/setter role committed three errors in the game and received
continuous pressure from the Patriots defense. "

The 31-29 loss forced Beerman to readjust his strategy in
game two against George Mason’s relentless countering
attacks. Pitt played with precision "in the second game as
Beerman reverted to the team’s original 5-1 offense, with

BCS needs
a little
fine-tuning

 

Sports Vniw

Matt Miloszewski

After an insane weekend of watching
college and professional football, I have
come to a few realizations.

First, the BCS works. Many people’

who contend Miami is the best tearrr in the
country think the Hurricanes are getting the
shaft after being ranking fourth in the ﬁrst
BCS rankings. . r.

Idisagreewiththemandwithlvliarni.
The BCS components are simple in my
mind, and how to achieve a high BCS rank-
ing is as well. First, you have to win all your
games. This obviously is the keycomponent
to making it to the national championship
game. Second, schedule somebody who is
not Connecticut, Eastern Michigan or some
other local Division I-AA team to play.
Miami and Virginia Tech, you should really
look into this.

Now the big issue people are discussing
isifUCLAgoesundefeatedandsodoes
either Oklahoma or Nebraska, will Miami
or Virginia Tech be left out again? The
answer is yes, and deservingly so.

Since the Hurricanes and Hokies have
decided to schedule non-conference power-
houses such as Penn State, Troy State and
Connecticut, they get. exactly what they
deserve.Boththeseteamsshouldtakea
page out of Nebraska’s or Michigan’s (who
plays the second toughest schedule in the

Pitt finally looks primed to cover a game

Airhl Nebraska ﬁnally failed to cover
as Texas Tech hung in with’ the
Cornhuskers for the better part of
Saturday’s game, spoiling my quest for a
perfect weekend. But my strong 4-1

record brought my overall record to a‘

respectable l6—12—1. You’re welcome.

In the four wins, Boston College and
UCLA spanked Pitt and Califomia, while
North Carolina shocked Clemson and
everyone’s favorite MAC team, Kent

State, covered against Buffalo.

I’ve got four picks for you this week.

‘Pitt at Temple (-1)

Pitt will look for its first road victory
(0-2) and its first win against a Division I-
A team this weekend against Temple, and
I think they’ll get both. No joke.

First off, you can throw out the home
ﬁeld advantage because the crowd most
likely will not exceed 5,000 people,
which will make the game seem more like
a scrimmage —— the Vet holds over
65,000.

Believe it "or not, this is a must-win
for Walt Harris because he must prove
that he has a grasp on his players. He cer-
tainly did yesterday, when he had the
team doing sprint after sprint at practice.

Temple comes into the game with a
2-4 record, but it was destroyed, much
like Pitt was, against Syracuse last week,
45-3. The other common opponent

between the two is Boston College. Pitt
lost_to Boston College 45-7 last week,
while Temple lost to Boston College 42-
23.

I actually like how Pitt matches up
against Temple. 1

Temple freshman quarterback Mike ‘

McGann is still learning, and I think if
Pitt’s defense is aggressive, like it’s capa-
ble of being, then it can disrupt the young
signal caller. Temple running back

Mississippi at LSU (-10.5)

At first glance, I liked Louisiana State
in this game, just by inspecting its 42-0
win at Mississippi State, a game they
were favored to win by just two.

But after looking at how good is
Mississippi’s quarterback Eli Manning,
brother of Peyton, and how LSU has

mediocre stat is inﬂated because of a 149- game at home
yard performance against a horrible since Oct. 6,

for Pitt on the defensive side is containing think the spread is just too big.

18.6 yards per catch.

I expect Ray Kirkley to rtm freely on
Temple’s defense, so it all comes down to
whoever is playing quarterback for Pitt to
not screw up. I know that’s asking a lot,
but if the Pitt offense can make a couple
of plays, Pitt should win.

All Pitt needs to do is win by one
freaking point.

ment from her two kills in the first
game, and the team committed only
three errors using-the 5-1 arrangement,
defeating the Patriots 30-24.

A tight offensive and defensive bat-
tle started in game three as neither team
extended more than a one-point lead,
until a George Mason kill that tied the
game at nine ignited the Patriots’
offense. ~ -

The Patriots rallied after the tie,
scoring seven consecutive points.
Beerrnan’s actions implied infuriation
as he barked orders with aggressive
hand movements‘ to a Pitt squad that
never recovered from the deﬁcit, losing
30-19. -

Pitt_ took the fourth game after
breaking a tie at 23 and winning seven
of the next nine points scored.

The Panthers played the ﬁfth game
with fury as they fought to answer all
George Mason’s points, and midway
through took a 7-4 lead off an Ullery
kill.

_ A striking offensive performance by
the Patriots brought their team back as
they scored four straight points.. The
seesaw battle saw the game tied‘ at 13,
before a keen George Mason defensive
stance allowed the team to score two
consecutive points, conquering the

0 Panthers 15-13.

“We laid an egg,” Beerman said.
“We do not compete at the appropriate
times and we need to find a way to win

games with some type of consistency,.

like we did against West Virginia.”

Pitt 3, West Virginia 0

After the Panthers suffered one of
their seven ﬁfth—game decision losses to
Youngstown State, Beerman said he
needed to take a day off to get away
from the team.

When he resumed practices, the

squad prepared for West Virginia, but

Beerman credited his team’s clear-cut
execution against West Virginia, not to
practice, but to the 382.. fans in atten-
dance, for the Panthers’ spirit night.

’ “A big crowd can create a big per-
formance,” he suggested.

Norris achieved her fourth straight’

triple—doub1e recording 20 assists, 12
kills and 12 digs, while Hatlestad led the
match with 13. kills, and Macke added
19 assists.

In the first game the Panthers com-
mitted 12 errors to the Mountaineers’
five, but the women stayed focused and
pulled out a victory 30-27.

Pitt replaced its errors with kills as ~
they out—attacked West Virginia in game -

two, destroying the Mountaineers 30-
17. The team ﬁnished the sweep with a
30-23 win in the third and final frame.
Beerman was satisfied with the
team’s conﬁdence and its achievements,
complimenting the Panthers’ defense,
balance and focus. — ’
“We played strong against a weak
West Virginia team and we need to start
capitalizing against the weak oppo-
nents,” he said. “The girls competed
how I need them to, efﬁcient, calm and

-without interference in each other’s

jobs. They just’ focused on their own.”

and Notre Dame and was picked off three
times against Maryland.

Countering the Mountaineers’ poor
defense is a powerful  offense.

Miami running back Clinton Portis is
averaging 6.2 yards per carry as he has
scored four touchdowns and the offense is
more than balanced as Ken Dorsey heads
the quick striking passing attack.

Dorsey has thrown for 11 touch-
downs and just three picks. Wideout
Andre Johnson and tight end Jeremy
Shockey are dangerous deep threats.

The Hurricanes have won by an aver-
age margin of 33 points per game and I
like them to spank West Virginia.

Kent State at Ohio (-13)
How can a team that is‘ 1-5 and 0-3 at

home be a 13-point favorite? I have no

answer for that. I also have no answer for
why I continue to pick MAC games,
except for the reason that every week I
like Kent State (3-4), especially since
Nebraska’s in my doghouse.

Ohio has played well a few times this
season —— it lost close games to Iowa
State and Toledo, who recently lost to a
poor Ball State team.

Both teams covered against West
Virginia as Ohio lost 20-3 and Kent State
lost 34-14. Ohio lost to Akron by two,
while Kent State lost to Akron by four. '

I’m not to good at math but I think
that’s only a two-point difference. ‘

Kent State have covered for me
against West Virginia, Bowling Green
and last week against Buffalo. Until they
-fail to come through, I’ll take Kent State
again this week. Go Golden Flashes.

WVU heads to  Miami on Thursday

Teleconference, page 15

Tennessee, but Pasqualoni said his team was
very optimistic after the losses. He said the
defense had played well, but the oﬂense
struggled. Now with the offense in shape, he
said his team is ready for the challenge. ‘
Kickoff is at noon.

Miami gears up for its Thursday night
meeting with West Virginia

Miami (5-0, 2-0), coming off a bye
week, is hosting West Virginia (2-4, 0-2) on
Thursday night.

In response to not being number one in
the BCS poll Coker said that he was not dis-

appointed in the BCS. “We know where we
have we have to go, we have to win every
game,” he said. ‘

West Virginia is also coming off a bye
week. Rodriguez said he was still looking for
leadership on this team. “The seniors have to
play their best football and give us all they
have,” he said. ‘

He also commented on how dangerous
Miami’s offense is, and that West Virginia’s
offense must control the ball in order to keep
lVliarni’s offense off the ﬁeld.

q “We have to just keep people from
pounding and pounding us and we have to
tackle better, so we better get our problems
ﬁxed in a hurry or we are in for a long night,”

he said. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

Boston College hosts Notre Dame

Boston College head coach Tom
O’Bii'en'felt that his team put forth a good
effort in the Eagles’ 45-7 win over Pitt.

O’Brien stated that he is looking for his
wide receivers to step up to take some of the
focus off of Green. Green is leading rusher in
the conference with an average of 138.4
yards a game.

With respect to defending against the
Irish’s option O’Brien said that his team
faced the option against both Army and
Navy, which gave his defense a foundation
for defending the option. «

NFL shockers
are coming
early and often

Column, page 15

ing up to the survivors of the tournament
meeting in early January at the pre—selected
championship site. i

- Now what is going on in the NFL? I
have been avidly following for years now
and have never seen a season like this.

Take last week, for example. Of the 13
games played, only two of the favorites

- actually won.

I guess we can allblarne this on the
Rams of two years ago, who were 200-1
shots at winning the Super Bowl, until a
Trent Green knee injury revealed the best
grocery—bagger turned quarterback in recent
memory. " p ,

After the Rams’ improbable run, every
team feels they have a shot this year. How
long can this trend continue with every team
in jeopardy every week? At least the rest of
the season, in my mind.

' How far will these “out of nowhere”
teams go is the question. ’

Cleveland_---- somehow Butch Davis i

has his -team believing and playing pretty
good football. As long as the defense plays
tough and there are no major injuries, they
will make the playoffs as a wild—card team.
New England — Tom Brady, who‘
would have known? What does this say
about Drew Bledsoe’s ineffectiveness in the
same situation? It means the Patriots will
leave Bledsoe exposed in the expansion

draft and hope that the Houston Texans will ,

pick up him and his $100 million contract
Either way, one of these guys is gone at
the end of the season. It’s too bad that ﬂie
Patriots can’t play Indianapolis every week
If they could we might be looking at the
AFC champions, but sorry, not’ even 10
more David Patton gimmick plays will get
this team into the playoffs. -
Chicago — Why oh why did the
Steelers give up on Jim Miller after one half
of a football season when they have not
given up on several years of Kordell’

‘ Stewart? The Bears are glad they did, and

along with Brian Urlacher representing one
of the leagues best defenses, the Bears will
make the playoffs. They should thank the
Raven’s of 2000 for their blueprint for suc~
cess. "

Pittsburgh — What can I say about my
team? They have surprised everyone but a
few loyal followers and me. As Chicago did,

the Steelers have used Balt1'more’s plan.‘

Play tough defense, rim the ball and have the
quarterback not turn the ball over. This plan,
along with a very favorable schedule, should

propel the Steelers into winning the AFC‘ _

Central.‘

Matt Miloszewski is a columnist for the Pitt
News and can’t wait to make reservations to
see his Steelers in New Orleans.
