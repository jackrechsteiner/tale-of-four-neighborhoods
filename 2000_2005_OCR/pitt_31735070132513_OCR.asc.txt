Seniors becoming more stressed

MARIAH MOORE KHANNA
Staff Writer

Stress, a non—spe'cif1c response of
the body to a demand, has increased
among college students in the last few
years, according to recent reports
about college students’ mental health.

Mental illness — sometimes a
severe result of stress — among col-
lege students has climbed to 20 per-
cent, making it close to that of the
general population, according to U.S.
News and World Report.

But don’t burn your books and
book a ﬂight for Tahiti just yet. James
Cox, interim director of Pitt’s
Counseling Services said the report is
not cause for alarm, but simply con-
cem.

‘Cox is particularly concerned
about the cause of rising stress levels
among seniors, he said, since recent
reports focus mainly on freshmen’s
mental health.

“People often think of freshmen,
but our data shows that, increasingly,
seniors are stressed,” said Cox.

Data from Counseling Services
during the last three years shows a 5
percent drop in freshmen seeking the
services, while the number of seniors
seeking help has risen by 10 percent.

“The question is, ‘why is this hap-

pening?”’ Cox said. “If the problem is
internal, we can fix it. But if it is
external, what can we do?”

The internal stresses Cox
described often arise from common
stress-inducing issues in students’
lives, ranging‘ from relationships to
academic problems.

External stresses, on the other
hand, can develop from a high unem-
ployment rate, a struggling economy
or the threat of war.

“It is much harder to help the stu-

dents,” Cox said, referring to external

problems. “I saw a student yesterday
who — I don’t think he knows how he
can pay for next semester. And that’s
got to be really stressful.”

While Cox couldn’t say for cer-
tain that the problem is because of
recent economic pressures on stu-
dents, he suggested that anxiety about
money has risen with students’ ambi-
tions for higher education. ‘

More than ever, students hold
outside jobs or carry multiple majors,
according to Cox.

“It used to be that students really
liked both subjects they majored in,”
he said, adding that more students
now tend to choose subjects that they
believe will guarantee steady
incomes. , '

Though 17,000 freshmen applied

to Pitt this year, there were only 3,000
slots to be ﬁlled, Cox said.

Considering this, in addition to
the cut in state grants to the University
this year, the increase in stress “is not
a big mystery,” he added.

While programs such as Pitt
Pathway attempt to get freshman on
the right track toward academic suc-
cess and emotional well—being, Cox
pointed out that seniors who are enter-
ing the job market have fewer
options.

Many seniors worry that they
don’t have marketable skills, Cox
said, adding that they should look at
graduate school and take advantage of
networking. ~

Before graduating, it’s important
to do an internship as well, he said.

In terms of dealing with stress,
Cox reminded all students that most
anxieties and fears are “normal and
appropriate” ‘—— as well as short-lived.

But if that isn’t the case, students
should not hesitate to use support ser-
vices, he added.

Even the simplest proactive
approaches can help alleviate stress.
A ﬂier that Cox gives to stressed stu-
dents declares that the top ways of
“helping yourself’ are getting exer-
cise, discussing the stress with a
friend, and making time for fun.

Our economy is doing well andhas an even

Secretary Don Evans. 0 «

Earlier this week, he spoke to a group of grad-
uate students at Carnegie Mellon University’s
School of Industrial Administration.

‘The manufacturing sector is growing,” Evans
said. “By itself, it would be the ﬁfth largest econo-
my in the world today.” '

And most economists predict more growth, he
said. ‘

According to a Sept. 16 press release from the
Department of Commerce, disposable personal
income is now up 3.4 percent, and the gross
domestic product increased 3.1 percent during the
second quarter.

However, Evans added that the manufacturing
sector has faced challenges, including decreased
demand and troublein international markets.

Library suffers from cuts

MARIAH MOORE KHANNA
Staff Writer

A person wandering into Carnegie
Library’s main branch in Oakland enters
under the inscription “Free to the People.”

Until recently, the engraving above

the library was true seven days a week for
the more than 280 organizations that
patronized it ,
' Since this surnrner’s funding cuts for
Pennsylvania public libraries, however,
the promise has become more difficult to
maintain, with the library omitting
Sundays from its schedule.

The cuts reduced Carnegie Library’s
government funding by 50 percent, or

$2.4 million. The reduction struck a blow .

to the library system’s hours of operation,
as well as its ability to provide reading
programs to the people who need them
most 4 .

“We can’t send staff out when only
two people are working at a branc ,” said
Blanche McManus, regional manager of
the Squirrel Hill branch.

Certain services, ranging from adult
literacy programs to Head Start, no longer
have staff members going into communi-
ties and providing outreach.

On July 1, all branches cut hours by
an average of 21 percent, according to
Lane Cigna, communications director for
the library. Now, the 2.2 million people
who patronize the library annually must
ﬁnd time during a smaller range of hours,
while also vying for the increasingly lirn—
ited resources available.

In addition to opening an hour later
and closing an hour earlier each day dur-
ing the week, the Carnegie Library in
Oakland no longer operates on Sunday at
all. And while daily overdue fees have
gone up from a nickel to a quarter, the
library now receives 10 percent less mate-
rial than it did before.

The adjustments have not stopped
patrons from coming in, Cigna said,
pointing out that “as the economy weak-
ens, library patronage increases.”

People become dependent on
libraries as educational resources, she
explained, and “the catch,” now, is that
when citizens need them most, they are
having ﬁnancial trouble meeting those
needs. ‘ ‘

Cigna also voiced her concern about
the message that the ftmding cut sent to
public libraries.

“Other areas were whacked, at most,
10 to 20 percent,” she said about other
state-funded organizations, adding that
public libraries lost half of their ftmding.

Carnegie Library staff members
have remained diligent in sending a mes-
sage to the government. In teams of three,
members travel to Washington, D.C. and
visit senators, hoping to persuade them to
restore funding. V _

Although no one seems to be against
libraries —— state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-

 

Allegheny, and his farrrily frequent the
Squirrel Hill branch — McManus won-
dered how much representatives can do to
help libraries when other services, like
Port Authority Transit and health care
programs, are also seeking restoration of
funds.

Meanwhile, McManus awaits seeing
what the legislative branch will decide.

McManus recalled that, on the ﬁrst
day of hour cuts, at least 50 patrons lined
up at each set of doors to her branch.

Would she be surprised if the funding
was fully restored?

“I wouldn’t be surprised,” McManus
said. “I’d be delighted.”

Janitors plan to campaign

for health care insurance

MICHELLE SCOTT
Senior Staff Writer

After negotiating a new contract
with Pitt,.the workers in the purple
shirts are back, and this time, they’re
going Downtown.

On Oct. 31, the contract for the
approximately 1,000 Service
Employees International Union jani-
tors, who clean many of the offices
Downtown, expires. So SEIU, the
union that includes Pitt’s custodians
and grounds crew, is organizing the
Downtown Contract Campaign to
support their interests. 9

Wednesday night, Tom Hoffman,
SEIU’s spokesperson, and Jim Bird, a
custodian and SEIU steward for the
One Mellon Center building, met
with Students in Solidarity to discuss
their issues and plans for the cam-
paign. , _

Hoffman said that, although
SEIU supports the fight for a living
wage, the main focus of the campaign
is obtaining affordable health care
coverage, particularly for families.

According to an SEIU news
release, 15 percent of workers in
Allegheny County making between
$20,000 and $30,000 go without
health care coverage because they
cannot afford the premiums‘.

Hoffman added that health care
premiums in Allegheny County have
increased and are now higher than
anywhere else in the country.

“If I was married, I wouldn’t be
able to afford health care coverage
for me and my wife,” Bird said. “I
remember when I was growing up in
the 60s, 70s and 80s, I never dreamed
health care would be an issue.”

William Modoono, spokesman
for UPMC Health Plan, said the ris-

' ing cost of health care affects all

parts of the country. He -explained
that health care costs are rising in
response to emerging technologies
that can better prevent and treat ill-
nesses, rising pharmacy costs
prompted ‘ by better drugs and
increased direct advertising, and the
region’s aging population. ’
To start the fight to ensure family

‘In an article published Wednesday, Sept. 17, titled “Journalists face more
scrutiny,” The Pitt News incorrectly reported that The New York Times ﬁred
Rick Bragg. Bragg, in fact, quit after being suspended by The Times for writ-
ing a story based largely on a freelance writerfs work, -without giving credit
to the writer.

The Pitt News regrets the error.

health care, regardless of the reasons
for the cost increases, SEIU workers
held their kick-off convention to the
campaign at the United Church of
Christ, Downtown on Sept. 13. The
union will be rallying Downtown on
Sept. 26 and Oct. 17, and gathering
support from community groups,
such as the North Shore Community
Group and Students in Solidarity,
during the next month.

Hoffman added that SEIU would
be sending delegations to meet with
the tenants of Pittsburgh office build-
ings, such as Liberty Center- and the
Fifth Avenue Place Building, to intro-
duce the office workers to the jani-
tors and ask for support.

The SEIU Downtown contract
campaign is part of the union’s larger
Justice for Janitors campaign, which
works for affordable health care and
janitors’ interests in cities around the
country. Hoffman said that, during
the spring, SEIU supported a strike in
Boston and obtained health care for
600 janitors. I

Now, the international union is
working to make health care an issue
for the presidential election in 2004.
Hoffman described the posters SEIU
will be hanging in the airports of
states with early primaries‘: a female
health care worker pointing directly

_at the Viewer, saying, “Running for

President? Health Care better be your
priority.”

_ “If we’re going to get a solution,
it’s going to be a national solution,”
Hoffman said. “We see what’s hap-
pening to the janitors here as a way to
galvanize the community for what
we’re going to be fighting for next
year.” y

He added that, though SEIU
‘workers at Pitt had recently accepted
a contract with enough of awage
increase to cushion their rising health
care costs, some appeared at last

week’s convention to show their sup- '1

port.

“Pitt janitors know that the
Downtown janitors were there for
them during the Pitt negotiations, so
they’ll be there for the Downtown
people,” Hoffman said.

Following “Guts,” Palahniuk spilled
his own, candidly ﬁelding a diverse array
of questions about success, writing and

about it was that it allowed him to quit his

He also touched on the state of the

worse, as people maintain an inability to
cope with violent realities, like death.

As with the rest of his work, though,

with humor. ' . -

' “This day is a two—way street.

SiX—Point Plan to increase jobs

and help witheconomic growth

Commerce, page 2

‘‘[The] government doesn’t create
wealth and [the] government doesn’t cre-
ate jobs,” Evans said. “The private sector
does.”

What the government can do is help
create an environment for economic

growth, he said. A

To do that, President George W. Bush
plans to discuss economic growth with key
leaders in the global economy, open more
international markets and take steps to
enforce international trade laws.

Evans also discussed Bush’s Six-Point
Plan to develop economic growth and cre-
ate jobs. His plan includes making “tax
relief permanent,” lowering health care
costs, cracking down" on frivolous lawsuits,
ensuring that the United States has an
affordable and reliable energy supply,
“streamlining regulations and reporting
requirements,” and opening international
markets to American products. '

“We _can’t be the only engines of
growth in the world,” Evans said.

Technology will also play a key role in
U.S. economic growth, he added.

“You’re the future,” Evans told the
graduate students. “You represent the
future for my children and my grandchil-
dren and this nation.”

Before his speech, Evans attended a
demonstration of robots designed at CMU.

According to Evans, CMU is “one of
the greatest campuses in the world” for
technology and innovation.

“We’ve always been the innovating
nationin the world,” Evans said. And col-
lege students, like those at CMU, will
ensure that the U.S. continues to be, he
said. »

Advancements in technology, Cassing

- said, have usually proven to be “[engines]

of growth.”

However, Bush’s Six-Point Plan prob-
ably will not have much of an impact on

Cassing said. Similar plans from previous
government administrations have not
proven to be very effective, and Bush’s
plan will probably be no dilferent, he
added.

The economy is not usually inﬂu-
enced by government intervention, but the
plan might reassure voters that Bush is
concerned about the economy, he said.

“I think a lot of it is just political pos-
turing,” Cassing said. .

Thomas related an example of the
immediate impact the day had on edu-
cating people abouttheir health.

“Today, a man who saw our setup
outside the shop came over during a
break from work and decided to get
his blood pressure checked,” Thomas
said, describing a person who sought
help at the Sittin’ Pretty Salon and
Day Spa in the Hill District. “This
man’s blood pressure was so high
from hypertension that we referred
him to a hospital on the spot to get
immediate medical attention.” .

The Center for Minority Health’s
complete program, which also encom-
passed the events on Sept. 16, is
called the “African American Health
Promotion Campaign: Countdown to
2010.”

Among its many goals, the pro-
gram aims to train barbers to use
Automatic External Defibrillators ——
emergency medical machines that
electrically shock the heart muscles
and, hopefully, jolt it back -into a reg-
ular rhythm in the event of a heart
attack. Defibrillators usually cost

' $3,000 a piece, but, according to

Thomas, the center has negotiated the

.manufacturer’s price down to around

$1,000 a piece.‘

The center is still raising money
for the program. I
The program also hopes to give

Day part of health promotion campaign

barbers access to laptops with wire- '

less Internet connections to the
National Library of Medicine as an
educational supplement.
Representatives‘ demonstrated this
‘element of the program at Bat’s
Barbershop in East Liberty during the
day. ‘ "
“We want barbers to be partners
with medical professionals within the
community,” Thomas said.
Anthony Jefferson, who cuts hair
at Mark Anthony Beauty Salon in

Oakland, said he gets-health related‘

questions from customers. all the time.

“People ask me,’ ‘Why’s my hair
falling out?’ and I tell them, unless
it’s hair-product related, that probably
their blood’§ not healthy,” he said. “If
you’re anemic, or your blood pres-

sure’s too high, or you’re not getting

enough iron or protein, your hair’s
like an antenna, and it’s gonna be one
of the first things affected.”
Information packets passed out at
barbershops covered information on
Type—2 diabetes, AIDS prevention,
breast self-exams and ways to ‘quit
smoking, among other health topics.

One to watch amidst Democratic hopefuls

On Wednesday, retired Gen.
Wesley K.’ Clark announced he’d be

joining, the crew of hopefuls for the"

Democratic nomination for presi-
dent, bringing the total to 10.

Clark has never held office and
has as much as a two-year fund-
raising gap between himself and his
competitors, but he merits notice —
as an anomaly, and as a realistic
possibility. .

He’s a four-star general with
diplomatic experience who graduat-
ed first in his class at West Point,
yet he’s vocally opposed the war in
Iraq and has. been criticizing the
continued occupation thereof. Other
than John Kerry, he’s the only
hopeful with any military experi-
ence. L —

A Rhodes Scholar, he was
awarded the Medal of Freedom, the
nation’s highest civilian honor. He
also holds honorary Dutch and
British knighthoods. ,

Clearly, he’s a bright man, but

not onewho has articulated a plan

» for the nation.

_ He criticized Bush for the
deficit, the sour economy ~ and
issues of national security and civil
liberties — yet he’ll only say that
his ideas are forthcoming in a major
speech in the coming weeks.

He’s, got the implicit endorse-
ment of Bill Clinton —— still greatly

beloved by many Democrats.
Clinton said the Democratic party
had two stars; his wife, Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton, and Clark.

This could hurt Clark’s credibil-
ity, however, from those still smart-
ing from the blush of scandal
brought by Clinton. -

Clark seems to lack the per-
ceived extreme liberalism of
Howard Dean whether Dean
truly is uber-liberal is up for discus-
sion, but he’s seen as such. He also
lacks the funding Dean has been
garnering. *

Grass-roots‘. buzz surrounds
Clark. ‘

' He’s got the cachet of having

been asked by his supporters to run, '

as opposedto asking for ‘people to
support him. _

This certainly demonstrates
faith in the man on the part of his
supporters. , —

With no history as.an elected

‘ official, Clark hasno voting record.

He" can’t demonstrate his ideologies
in practice, buthe also can’t be crit-
icized for hypocritical or unpopular
votes. A

_Clark, while adding . to an
already clogged pool of mostly
unremarkable potential candidates
for the wounded Democratic Party
nomination, seems to merit close
attention as primary races heat up.

Lukewarm acceptance yields subtle racism

A couple weeks ago, Wall Street
Journal columnist David Wessel
detailed the results of a year-old
study on race bias in job hiring. The
study, conducted by Northwestern
University sociologist Devah Pager,
sent black and white college students
with similar skill sets and
qualifications to 350
Milwaukee-area employers
to apply for unskilled, low-
paying jobs.

Pager asked some appli-
cants to say they had spent
eighteen months in prison,
convicted of cocaine posses-
sion with intent to sell. She
then measured the percent-
ages of white people and
black people, with and with-
out a “criminal record,” who were
called back for a second interview.

The results were disturbing, to
say the least. Thirty-four percent of
white people with no reported record
were called back, compared to 14
percent of black people. Meanwhile,
17 percent of white people “convict-
ed” of cocaine possession got a call;
only 5 percent of black applicants
who claimed a record were called
back.

Add up the figures, and the con-
clusion — even apart from Pager’s
also—important point about discrimi-
nation against the formerly incarcer-
ated, who most need a job to recon-
nect with society —- is that a black
employee is less attractive to employ-
ers than a white one, even one with a
criminal past. '

The figures are disturbing, but
maybe not surprising —— to anyone
who wants to pay attention, anyway.
They occupied a space somewhere in
the back of my head, the place most
Americans store difficult questions
about race, until I read Martin Luther
King Jr.’s “Letter From A
Birmingham Jail.”

In the letter, King responded to

  

Jesse Hicks
Columnist

moderate, white clergymen who crit-
icized his work as “unwise and
untimely.” They denounced his sup-
porters as “outside agitators,” while

claiming to want equality for black

people, just not“ yet. Equality would
come, they believed, through the
divine passage of time
and the fullness of
‘ God’s providence.
Responding to these
moderates, who
claimed to agree with
his goals but refused to
support his methods,
King wrote: “Shallow
understanding from
people of good will is
more frustrating than
absolute misunder-
standing from people of ill will.
Lukewarm acceptance is more bewil-
dering than outright rejection.”

It is lukewarm acceptance that
leads to the problems revealed in
Pager’s study. I doubt the employers
tested would consider themselves
racist, in the “outward rejection”
sense.

Yet their actions continued a sub-
tler, perhaps more dangerous kind of
racism — the lukewarm acceptance
that allows a human being to eat
where they wish, but makes it as hard
as possible for thatperson to get a
job. .

If we’ve made progress in elimi-
nating the stereotype of black inferi-
ority, we’ve made little in redefining
the common ideapof racism.

It does not always come hooded
in white sheets; it is not always as
obvious as a burning cross.

 

Racism still exists, we admit, but?

we’d like to believe it is found only

in backwoods enclaves of snaggle-I

toothed yokels far removed from us
and our polite society.-

What, then, are we to make of the
2001 Massachusetts Institute of
Technology study finding that a

tnirmimn iklltl mmzz

.  i>.U':ae.:r M-.¢'.x.x" 1:: g ‘I’ r arr r 1* rs". tr-:"i‘.s=*c‘s' w*v.~*zs ‘

“white-sounding” name increases
one’s chance of an employer callback
by 50 percent — the equivalent of
eight extra years of experience for a
black applicant?

Few people are fully aware of
their own prejudices, which is part of
the problem: an unrecognized belief
cannot be challenged. It remains hid-
den, unarticulated, in the back of the
mind, revealed only indeed, not in
thought. Without recognizing quiet,
individual prejudice, it’s ‘impossible
to change the resulting unjust society.

Another Pager study punctured
another comfortable self-delusion:
it’s common for “white-flight” fami-
lies to claim higher crime rates as
their reasons fbr leaving an integrat-
ed neighborhood. Yet the stron-gest
factor in whites peop1e’s perception
of higher crime rates was not actual
crime statistics, but the number of
young, black‘ men_in the neighbor-
hood. , '

To -them, young, black people.
were synonymous with crime, a
belief they couldn’t recognize in
themselves. ‘- ,

The only way to change this kind
of subconscious misperception is to
become aware that it exists, both in
us and in society. A Gallup poll cited
in Wessel’s article found 55 percent
of white. Americans felt racial minori-
ties have equal job opportunities in
this country, compared to just 7 per-
cent of black Americans. Who’s more
in touch with reality? Why is that?

White Americans cannot continue
this blindness behind the twin veils
of goodwill and denial. Martin Luther
King, Jr. fought and died combating
outward rejection. _ '

It’s left to the rest of us, all of us,
to defeat the" problem of our own
lukewarm acceptance.

INTERVIEWED BY
DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A&E Editor

For her feature ﬁlm directorial debut —
a co—directorial effort with her sister Maria
—— Gabrielle C. Burton, an actor, writer and
producer, worked with Frank Gorshin,
Shirley Jones, Seymour Cassel and Wendie
Malick, among many others. She, along
with her four sisters, started their own pro-
duction company; Five Sisters Productions
created three ﬁlms, “Just Friends,” “Temps”
— which Gabrielle also wrote —— and their
latest, ‘ ‘Manna From Heaven,” which comes
to Pittsburgh this weekend. To get the word
out about the ﬁlm, Gabrielle and Five Sisters
Productions have hit the road with a “Manna
From Heaven” tour. She took time out of the
tour to talk about the ﬁlm, working with the
cast, and the experience of directing “Manna
From Heaven,” in addition to the grass-roots
campaign to let people know about the ﬁlm

What was the ‘genesis of “Manna From

Heaven?’ ’ ’

 

COURTESY F I VESISTERSPROD UC TIONS. COM

Talk: Director Gabrielle C. Burton

My mother went to ﬁlm school; she was
a novelist and she went to ﬁlm school
because there was a novel she had written
that she had a bunch of interest in making
into a ﬁlm, and she wanted to write the
screenplay. About four or ﬁve years ago, she
went back to ﬁlm school at the American
Film Institute and wrote a few scripts. One
of the scripts she wrote was “Manna From
Heaven.” And so, when a lot of people were
calling her, interested in looking at her work,
we said, “Mon1, we would love to make this
movie.” So she gave us a year to make it, we
optioned it for a dollar, and off we went.

What was the experience like of Working

One hellof a good game

Disgaea: Hour of Darkness
Pulished by Atlus, developed by Nippon
lchi A ‘ J
Playstation 2
tkikik
‘ T.J. CONDON
StaffWriter

These days, video games take themselves too
seriously. Stealth this and counter—terrorist that.
Thank heavens — or hells —e that “Disgaea: Hour of
Darkness” has come to save- us from stiff, dry game
play by bringing us a joke — literally — of a tactical
role—playing game.

The plot is refreshingly simple. Your father, the
Lord of the Underworld, has kicked the bucket. As

the rightful heir to the throne, your duty is to beat the ‘
pulp out _of all who oppose your ascension. It’s ‘

enough to move the game but not enough to get in

the way of the comedy. What other game can use

“Hell” as a form of currency? Need some cash? Go
raise some Hell. How? Kill enemies; you’ll get Hell
for it. ’

One would be quick to say that this game bears
a healthy —— and by healthy, I mean power—smooth—

‘ ie, low cholesterol, jog-three-rniles-a—day healthy -

resemblance to Final Fantasy Tactics. The graphical
style —- richly deﬁned, anime+type sprites on 3D bat-
tlegrounds — is almost identical to FFT, save for lots

of polish afforded by the Playstation 2’s capabilities.
The battle system feels very familiar as well, though
“Disgaea” goes the extra mile in making combat fun
for everyone. Four—character gang attacks, over-the-
top special techniques and aspects such as terrain
advantages/disadvantages dispel any suspicions that
this is just a rehash of an old classic. Additional fea-
tures, such as a demonic senate and intricate charac-

ter creation serve to distinguish this game from its >

peers. .

Animated cut scenes are absent from this game,
as their duties have beenfulﬁlled by static images
and voice—overs, which seem to ﬁt -the style of the
game more effectively. Also, while some hard—core
gamers will rejoice over the inclusion of the
Japanese language track as an option, the English
dialogue is well—performed and augments the
comedic nature of the game. The music, featuring
“The Invasion from VV1thin” by California punk-

rockers Tsunami Bomb, does its job and — thank- .

fully — doesn’t run the licensed song into the
ground. ,
Despite the jocularity, this game isn’t for every-

one. An unlimited supply of dungeons, an incredibly

high level cap (9999) and lots of thinking promote

hours upon hours of play, which is just too much for ,
' some people to handle. If you don’t have the time -to

devote to a game this large and detailed, it’s not
worth it. However, if you have plenty of time to burn,
there’s no reason in Hell to overlook this game.

Getting your groove
on with the Family

KATIE MAVRICH
A&E Editor

The'Family Groove Company keeps
moving east. They formed in Los
Angeles and, afterfmding that the jam-
band scene wasn’t exactly thriving there,
they packed up and moved to Chicago.
Tonight, their journeying takes them fur-
ther east than ever before, collectively

anyway — bassist Janis Wallin hails
from near Harrisburg —— to play a show
here in Pittsburgh.

Though the jam-band audience is
their target, they hesitate to call them-
selves a jam band. “It’s mostly because
that term is really taking on a really
broad meaning,” said lead vocalist/key-
boardist Jordan VV1lkow. “The reluctance
comes in because it’s really a scene that’s
sortiof exploded and there are an awful
lot of bands. There’s a huge range of
musical styles that are putting them-
selves in that genre, and we take a lot of
pride in‘the improvisation that we have to
offer.” ;

“We worry, sometimes, that the word
‘jamband’ is going to start having a neg-
ative connotation, where it’ s a band with
a lot of guitars that never stops playing
and plays forever and doesn’t have any-
thing that isn’t totally redundant to say,
musically,” he continued.

Fans of the genre, however, are sure
to catch a high-energy, improvisational
show that will last from three to four
hours. ..
“We find that this musicis a very
interactive experience. So much of it is
being created on stagein that particular

moment,” said Wilkow. A
Sometimes, venues are less than
crowded at Family Groove Company’s

shows; one such occasion occurred in

L.A.
7 “We really found, particularly with

the venues that we were trying to play at, ’

that people just weren’t willing to trust
music that -was meant to stand for it’s

own sake as opposed to music that is
about how the musician is,” said Wilkow. 7

Their music combines rock with jazz
and throws in elements of funk, groove
and soul. Some of the songs on their
debut full—length album, Reachin, are
reminiscent of Phish. “As ’Abe Was
Walking,” is‘ one such- song. Family

‘ Groove Company cites the proprietors of

the genre that they hesitate to ﬁt into,

j am-band godfathers The Grateful Dead,‘

as one of their favorite bands, as well as

‘inﬂuences, and it comes through in their '

ﬂowing tunes.

In addition to melodic keyboards on '

a lot of the songs on the album, a piano
shines through on “Interesting Changes,”

’a slow and soft ballad. It is this song that

sets them apart from the typical jam
band.

What is noteworthy about Reachin is
that only one of the 10 songs on the '
‘album clocks in under ﬁve minutes and
one never gets bored listening to the _

longer, almost eight—minute tracks.

. Family Groove Company will play a
2] -and—over show at Buskers, in the Strip
District, tonight at 10 p.m. There is a $3
cover charge. For more information, call

Hard workin’ hillbillies

Hillbilly State of Mind
PovertyNeck Hillbillies
72ni‘r1/2 -

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

A lot of people from the city rag
on people_from the country, like peo-
ple from the sticks aren’t civilized
folks. Well that’s a bunch of bull, and
there’s a lot of proof against it —— just
don’t go to my hometown of
Fredericktown, Pa.

Some fresh, new faces in country
music aretaking center stage, and
they hail from the sticks of
Southwestern Pa., in good ol’ Fayette
County, not far from Fredericktown.

PovertyNeck Hillbillies don’t
play sappy country music about los-
ing your dog and your girlfriend in
the same day. Their music is filled
with energy and emotion, and it
rocks. ,

Along with front man Chris
Abbondanza, who also plays acoustic
guitar on the album, is Chris Higbee
on fiddle, Jeff Volek on bass, Bob
Crafton on guitar, Dave Cramer on
keyboard and Ryan Lucotch on
drums. g

Anyone who has seen the
Hillbillies play a live show can tell
you that, after just one show, you.’re
hooked. And that’s their goal —— to
bring in those people who aren’t big
country fans.

They made history earlier this

year by being the first original coun-

try act to compete in the Graffiti
Rock Challenge, bringing a little bit

of country to the people of
Pittsburgh, which is predominately a
rock—music city. Not only did they
compete, but they also made things
interesting by tying in their semifinal
night and creating a five—band final
instead of the planned four—band
event.

Their debut album, Hillbilly State
of Mind, is a testament to their fresh
success and all of their hard work as
a band. The album features 10 origi-
nal tracks and Hillbilly covers of
Tonic’s_ “If You Could Only See” and
Lionel Ritchie’s “Stuck on You.”

The first single, “Mr. Right
Now,” is a fun and energetic track
that is a crowd favorite and is played
on Y—l08. The chorus sings out, “I
might not be Mr. Right/Baby we
could have some fun tonight/I might
not be Mr. Rightl But I’m Mr. Right
Now.”

The title track is another favorite
about how times have changed, but
the life you live is just fine. “We had
bear in the mountains and deer in the
woods /The corn grew tall just like it
should"/Friday night had a hillbilly
ball /Picking and singing and carry-
ing on. /Summertime in the pale
moonlight /Me and my girl gettin’ it
right /It’s a way of life and hey it suits
me fine fTalking ‘bout a hillbilly state
of mind.”

There are some slower and more
emotional tracks, but the Hillbillies
love to have fun and show it in their
music, and this debut is sure to help
them move their way out of the sticks
of southwestern Pa., and hopefully
into the limelight of Nashville, Tenn.

Introspective art exhibits

“Memorial Project Vietnam” and “The
Paper Sculpture Show”

Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba and
Independent Curators International
Regina Gougher Miller Gallery

Carnegie Mellon Campus
(412) 268-3877

ELIZABETH COWAN
Staff Writer

Who owns an? What is the relationship between
idea development and idea execution? When the cre-
ator of the physical work and the creator of the con-
ceptual basis are not the same person, who declares
responsibility for the subsequent art? These are all
questions subtly posed by a new exhibit at CMU’s
Regina Gouger Miller Gallery, “The Paper Sculpture
Show.” And during a year when the Deputy Assistant
Attorney General John G. Malcolm testiﬁed to parts of
Congress on the proposed links between such things as
organized crime, terrorism, and “Intellectual Property
Piracy,” such questions reveal a new urgency.

What makes “The Paper Sculpture Show” so
unique is the origin of the artwork ﬁlling the gallery’s
third ﬂoor space. While artists and teams of artists
were pulled together by Independent Curators
International to submit blueprints, visitors of the show
build the actual sculptures. The sculptures have
already been designed by the artists, and all the neces-
sary materials and instructions are provided.

The result is a gallery exhibit that more closely

resembles an art studio ——
complete with wooden
workstations, scissors and
glue, and, perhaps most
importantly, stacks of
paper, which provide the
two—dimensional medium
of this three-dimensional
show. Furthermore, as 
more and more guests  
attend the show, adding

their own artistic contri-
butions, the artwork itself
grows in volume, and the character of the show itself
undergoes change.

The artists who created the ideas behind the sculp-
tures are acknowledged for the role they play in the
exhibit’s development. In addition, the amateur sculp-
tors piecing the plans together have an opportunity to
lay claim to their labors; visitors are permitted to put
their names on the sculptures they create and then
reclaim them at the end of the show. The show is an
interesting opportunity for the artistically challenged
to create something aesthetically pleasing, while
simultaneously contemplating their relationship to
their works. .

Also featured at the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery
are two short ﬁlms created by Japanese artist Jun
Nguyen-Hatsushiba. The ﬁlms, which are collectively
known as “Memorial Project Vietnam,” are delivered
in homage to “boat people,” individuals who ﬂed
Vietnam at the official end of the war, in 1975.
Approximately a third of these “boat people” drowned

while trying to ﬂee.
Much of Jun’s artwork pays tribute to these fallen

Vietnamese, and he decided to create the ﬁlms based A

on his idea —— the construction of an underwater
memorial that could be visited by snorkelers and scuba
divers. The most memorable images of the ﬁlms
include streams of color created by food coloring, the
dance of a traditional New Year’s dragon puppet,
underwater competition between traditional cyclo dri-
vers and a visit to a submerged camp that comes to
resemble a burial area. A

The background is ﬁlled with loud, eerie sounds
—— a combination of musical arrangement, simulated
water sounds and Jun’s own voice. The videos, which
were ﬁlmed in Vietnamese waters, show the lingering
heartache for lost life and the cultural importance
attached to bodies of water in Vietnam. Jun is able to
comment on war without relying on any traditional
imagery. His message is subtler, gentler —— yet clearly
filled with and motivated by deep sadness.

admired, and it was amazing toygork with
them I was always really inipressed to

watch the way they worked Each of these’

actors has a diﬁerent preparation technique
and approach to acting, and I found that very
interesting to watch. Normally, you would
just be working with a couple of actors,
mainly, and you might have a couple of these
cameo roles for stars. Or, in an ensemble,
onscreen, are usually two people at a time;
it’s not eight people at a time working togeth-
er. SO that was a really neat experience.

Did they get along together right away Or
did it take a time for the cast to get accus-
tomed to each other?

It was really fascinating. Shirley Jones
and Frank Gorshin had grown up together.
They had never worked together, and they
hadn’t seen each other for probably 20 or 30
years or more. So when they showed up,
they said, “Oh my goodness.” They had
heard that we cast each of them, and they

 were delighted to work together. What was

wonderful about it was they’re playing a
con-artist married couple that had been
together for something like 30 years. What
was incredible was that they really had that
history together, and that was something we
didn’t have to worry about at all, having

chemistry or feeling cornfortable together. \

They hit it otf right away, and that was won-
derful. For the rest of the cast, I think part of
the reason they wanted to do the ﬁlm was
they found out these other people were
doing it too. They all ﬁrst gravitated toward
it because of the script, and then, when they
heard the other people in the cast, they

 as neat for all of them was that they
each ,di”di,_act all together. It wasn’t like they
were mﬁa. movie where someone else just
 They were actually acting togeth-
er, so Iknow that was something that was
interesting to all of them.

Did you have to twist anyone’s arm to get (0

them to be part of the ﬁlm?

No. The only issue was, actually, in ﬁg-

_ uring schedules. We were talking, for
instance, with Edward James Olmos about
being in die ﬁlm, and it just couldn’t work
with his schedule. We were trying to make it

- work, trying to push the shooting schedule

back a bit, but everyone had to be locked in
for four weeks in Buﬁalo, and that was kind
of it. So, there were some people we wanted
to work with, and it just didn’t work out with
their schedules.

What role was Edward James Olmos
goingtoplay?

We were considering him for Bake [a
character played by Drew Pillsbury that is
the romantic interest for Inez, Wendie
Malick’s character]. And I think he would
have been wonderful, but once you see who
we have in these roles now, you think,
“Someone else, this would have been differ-

someone that Wendie knew and had worked
with, sothatwasreally goodtobeableto
cast someone with whom Inez, the other
character, would have a chemistry and get
along with.

How has the ﬁlm been received, general-
ly?

It’s been wonderful. I think that when
we ﬁrst decided to take it out — we had had
a number of Offers from distributors, and
they wanted to open in New York and L.A.
as traditional releases do. And we just felt
like it wasn’t that type of movie because it

Burton and Five Sisters Productions take a grass—roots approach to promoting film

Burton, page 13 V

wasn’t going to make millions of dollars of
advertising — now the average advertising
budget for movies is $35 million. So, if
we’re up against all the movies in New York
with all of the millions of dollars they have
in advertising, the chances of ﬂoating in that
kind of environment are terrible. So we
thought, “Why don’t we start it outside of
New York.” And a lot of these companies
didn’t understand — the movie’s obviously
not a typical thing, but this movie isn’t a typ-
ical American independent, which ﬂrey said
as well, so they found it difficult to market it.
One ofthem said that, ifthe ﬁlm were Irish
or British, it would have been a slam dunk,
because it’s very much like that British inde-

pendent So, we thought, “Well, we want to
work with the same investors again and
again so we’re going to take it out, and We’ll
give a year of our lives to'go out and do this
ourselves.”

Do you enjoy taking this grass-roots
approach to getting the word out there
about your ﬁlm?

I think it’s.very fulﬁlling; at the same
time, it’s incredibly exhausting. It’s just this
machine that we’re up against, and you feel
it at every turn. “Manna” is opening at a lot
of multiplexes, so that is a whole system
where studios hire companies to go check
that trailers are playing or check that posters
are up, and that’s'all they do. And they check

how people feel about a ﬁlm, or tl1ey’re tak-
ing surveys of how people heard about it
And I think what’s amazing is that when we
open in cities, especially if it’s in a multiplex
— I’m delighted to open at The _ Oaks
Theater because I love opening at theaters
like that-, where you’re not up against “Hulk”
-—' it’s amazing how audiences are saying,
“Wow, it’s so incredible to see a ﬁlm like this
in a multiplex.” They expect to see it in the
art-house theaters or at more Oaks-like,
reﬁned theaters. It’s amazing to get that kind
of reception, and, I think, as artists, that
keeps us going, because it’s exhausting, and
it’s diﬁicult to -be out there handing out ﬂiers
to people, saying this movie exists, and it’s
dependent on people going.

Is directing something you’d like to focus

/ on more in the future, more than acting,

writing or producing?

Yeah I love directing. I’m deﬁnitely
interested in continuing directing. I like all of

I [those things]; they’re all different. That’s the

thing about them; they’re all very creative in
dilferent ways. I really don’t want to do it if
it’s just doing a project that’s' not that inter-
esting. There are. certain jobs you do for

— money, and there are certain jobs you do for
creativity. Making a ﬁlm takes so long, and .

it’s so diﬂicult, and it’s such a big part of
your life and a sacriﬁce, I think that I would
do it if it were something that I really cared
about If it were just to make something that
wasn’t that interesting, I think I’d rather do
one of the others.  , _ .

What is the next ﬁlm  you and your
production company, Five Sisters
Productions, will be working on?

We’re working, now, on putting togeth-
er a series of ﬁlms, actually. We’ll be work-
ing_ with diiferent ﬁlmmakers that we know,
so we would do a couple of the ﬁlms, and
then we would have people, all dilferent
types of talented people wepknow or people
in the industry, working together, doing this
set of ﬁlms that are connected through a
theme. And that’s.what we’re putting togeth-
er now. I think it’ll be really ﬁm and really
creative. What I like a lot about it is that you
can get a lot of different views on the same,
connected idea. I think it will be‘ a neat ‘chal-
lenge.

Men’ssoccerblanks Red Flash

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team was
able to snap its four—game losing
streak last night, with a 1-0 win over
the St. Francis Red Flash.

Pitt (2-4 Overall, 1-1 Big East)
and St. Francis (0-4-1) played a
scoreless first half. The Panthers
came close to -scoring on a_ few occa-
sions, only to see the ball miss the
net.

with 14:40 remaining in the first’

half, the . Panthers’ Jacob Kring
passed the ball across to forward
Keeyan Young, who kicked the ball
just tothe right of the net.

St. Francis applied offensive
pressure when forward Bernie
Showers. shot the ball into the box,
but Panther defenders bunched
together and kicked the ball out of
harm’s way. ’ ,

The second half started with the
momentum on St. Francis’ side. It
held the ball in Pitt’s offensive zone
in the beginning of the half.

The Red Flash almost got on the
scoreboard first when they ﬁred the

ball in on the net, causing Panthers’
goalkeeper Justin Lowery to make a
diving save. On the rebound, St.
Francis midfielder Andrew Rohacek
shot the ball past Lowery, but the
ball hit the post and deflected out of
bounds.

On another Panthers scoring
attempt, midfielder Bryan Headrick
moved the ball down the right side

of the field and fired the ball toward

the net from a tough angle. Flash
goalkeeper Bobby Pipech had to
dive out to make the save.

A few minutes after that oppor-
tunity, the Panthers’ Billy Brush
worked the ball over to Young, who

‘narrowly missed the net.

Soon after that, Brush scored,
giving Pitt the lead. Young kicked
the ball across the box, and Brush
dove in headfirst. The ball deﬂected
off his head and settled down beside
him. ,

Brush, who was now lying on the
ground, quickly jumped to his feet
and kicked the ball just over the Red
Flash goalkeeper, who was on the
ground after reacting to the previous
shot.

“[It was] purely hard work,”
Brush saidof his heads-up shot.

The goal came at the 59-minute-
mark. Young and Headrick were
credited with assists on the play.

With the 1-0 lead, the Panthers’
defense kept St. Francis from getting
any scoring opportunities. The last
scoring opportunity came when the-
Flash’s Eric Nelson shot the ball on
Lowery. Lowery dove to make the
save with about 11 minutes left to
play. _

With time running out, Showers
sent a final shot toward Lowery.
Lowery made the save as the buzzer
sounded.

“It was a solid win, but again, we
had trouble scoring goals,” Joe
Luxbacher said. “[But] we got the
one we needed.”

Pitt ended a four—game losing
streak, with its last victory coming
in its first game of the season,
against Boston College on Aug. 30.

“We needed a win and we got it,”
Luxbacher said.

The Panthers are next in action
against Big, East foe Seton Hall on
Sept. 20 at 1 p.m.

ES

  

The NFL football season is going into
its third week, and I’m not sure if it’s too
early for me to be bold and pick two teams
who are destined for Super Bowl
XXXVl]l .

But I need to ﬁll space, so what I will
do is oﬁer my analysis of which teams in
theAFC are forreal and whatteams need
to do to put themselves over the top.

Let’s look at the AFC East. Before the
season, «I would have said the New
England Patﬁots were a shoo-in for the
division title, but then the Patriots shot
themselves in the foot by cutting strong
safety Lawyer Milloy.

Milloy was not only a leader on the
ﬁeld, but in the locker room also. I felt
that, with the addition of outside line-
backer Roosevelt Colvin and the switch to
the 3-4, New England had an edge on
Miami and Buffalo.

Just two weeks into the season, I am
ready to make the bold prediction that
Buﬁalo will win the AFC East. The addi-
tions of outside linebackers Jeff Posey and
Takeo Spikes and defensive lineman Sam
Adams help a team that has all the tools
on offense, but is lacking defensively.

In early August, I had the opportunity
to watch the Buffalo Bills in their ﬁrst pre-
season game, against the Baltimore
Ravens, and I was not impressed. The
Ravens’ defense dominated the Bills’
offense while the staiters were playing in
the game.

But that was preseason, and Buffalo
has been convincing in its 31-0 spanking
of the Patriots and 38-17 victory over the
Jacksonville Jaguars. Buffalo also made a
great move in signing Milloy from their
division rival. .

‘ Miami has a stout defense with the
additions of Junior Sean and Sammy
Knight, but quarterback Jay Fiedler will
not be able to lead the oﬂ’ense to where it

Safety discusses love of football, muse and cheese

J OE MARACHILENA
Sports Editor

In April of 2002, Pitt lost both starting
safeties to knee injuries during a spring
practice. VV1th no experienced starters, the
Panthers seemed to have quite a bit of trou-

A ble in their secondary.

Up stepped then-sophomore Tyrone
Gilliard into the starting strong safety posi-
tion and what could
have been a soft spot
in the Pitt defense
solidiﬁed.

Gilliard started
11 of 13 games in
2002 and registered
49 tackles, including
one sack and two
tackles for loss. This
year, Gilliard started
the season with four
tackles against Kent .
State, including a sack. The safety fol-
lowed that up with- two more tackles and a
pass defensed against Ball State.

This week, he prepared for Toledo by
having the interview of a lifetime.

The  News: Why did you decide to
play football?

Tyrone Gilliard: My family did, thatis the

F thing I knew that wasfun, basically. It was

    
  

 

something that was fun and I was good at.

Running, tackling, trying to catch the per-

son, that’s all it’s about — having fun —
and I loved it. My family, that’s all they did
was football.

’ TPN: What would you say is your favorite

part of the game?

TG: There’s so much stuff. My favorite

- ‘ part about it is the
look on the oppo-
nent’s face, you
know, when they
know they got beat,
whether it’s the

running back or
' receiver, and you
score a touchdown
and you look at the
defensive player’s
, . face, or if you’re a
defensive player and you knock that ball
down. The receiver thinks he’s got the ball
and the defensive back knocks the pass
down, or‘a nmning back gets hit by a line-
backer and you see his face. That’s what I

TPN: What’s the hardest part of beinga
safety?

TG: The hardest part is knowing all the

offense, if you’re a .

College. I underesti-

stuff you have to do.
As a strong ‘safety,
tl1ere’s so much stuff
you have to know,
that you have to
check on, and things
like that. The strong
safety, in one call, he
could be doing two
or three things.

TPN: Of all the
guys you’ve had to a
tackle, who would
you say hits the
hardest?

TG: It was [Derrick]
Knight from Boston

mated him. I hit him
and hurt -my neck a
little bit, but I didn’t
tell him that

TPN:‘ Did you get a
chance to get him
back?

TG: I think so. I didn’t get him back real
well, not like I wanted. He didn’t hit me
head on; -I hit him from the side and I
underestimated his strength.

basketball schedule
for 2003-04 season

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball
team released its 2003-2004 sched-
ule on Tuesday, with new head
coach Agnus Berenato and the
Panthers opening the season at
home against Coppin State on Nov.
25.

The 26-game schedule includes
nine teams that advanced to the
NCAA Tournament last season and
two teams that reached the Women’s
National Invitational Tournament.
Among those teams will be two-
time defending national champion
Connecticut.

“I am looking forward to the
opportunity of competing as a part
of the University of Pittsburgh and
the Big East Conference,” Berenato
said. “We have a very challenging
and competitive schedule, playing
against 11 postseason teams from
last year. We can never take a day

off, and we have to work day—in and
day—out competing at our highest
level of ability.”

Among the other non-confer-
ence teams that will be coming to
the Petersen Events Center will be
Central Connecticut State,
Duquesne, Hartford, Clemson,
Xavier and Fordham. Pitt will also
go on the road to face Penn State,
Norfolk State and Robert Morris.

The Panthers will begin their
conference schedule at West
Virginia on Jan. 3. Pitt will host
conference foes Syracuse,
Providence, Virginia Tech, West
Virginia, Rutgers, Georgetown,
Notre Dame and Villanova at the
Petersen Events Center.

“We are going to challenge our
student athletes to be competitive in
one of the best conferences in the
country,” Berenato said. “We need
to be mentally ‘ready to face the
challenges of a rigorous schedule,
but I know we will be ready.”

UM Lacrosse suspends 44 for under age drinking

JASON J UZWIAK
The Diamondback (U. Maryland)

(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md. —

More than 40 players from the University of
Maryland men’s and women’s lacrosse teams
were suspended for all or half of the fall exhibi-
tion season for underage drinking at a party, the
athletics department announced in a press release
Monday. .

The suspensions*— determined by both,th
athletics administration and the head coaches —
bar 18 men and 13 women from competing in any
fall exhibition games. Five other men and eight
otherwomen cannot play in half the fall competi-
tions. In addition, 23 men and 21 women cannot
participate in a specified spring trip, which
includes regular-season games.

The men have scheduled a trip to Florida for
‘the spring of 2004, while the women’s team was
planning a trip during the spring of 2005. All
players will still be allowed to practice with the
teams and play in all other regular-season games.

The decision comes a little more than a week
after the department received an e-mail complaint
alleging hazing and underage drinking within the
‘teams, at which time an internal investigation

o began: Monday’s sanctions did not include the

hazing allegation, which was forwarded to the
Office of Judicial Programs for further review.
That office and local authorities could impose
further punishment on athletes who acted in vio-
lation of the university’s Student-Athlete Code of
Conduct and state laws with regard to acts of haz-
ing and initiation.

Reached at his home last night, John Zacker,
director for Student Discipline in the Office of
Judicial Programs, said his office had received all
of the relevant information. Zacker refused to dis-
cuss potential ramifications that could result from
a campus review of the incident.

“Our review of the underage drinking "issue
among_the women’s and men’s lacrosse programs,
including upperclassmen who participated in the
event, is concluded,” Associate Athletics Director
Kathleen Worthington said in a statement. “We
have forwarded the information to the Office of
Judicial Programs and Campus Police.” ~

All of the athletes found tohave breached the
Student-Athlete Code of Conduct will be
informed by letter that any further violations of

the code may lead to the loss of scholarship aid ‘

and dismissal from the team.

It was unclear Monday if either men’s
lacrosse head coach Dave Cottle or women’s
lacrosse head coach Cindy Timchal were pun-

ished for the violations. The press release cited
state laws regarding the confidentiality of person-
nel matters. _

“Our coaches are committed to do whatever is
prudent and necessary to best ensure that our stu-
dent-athletes remain safe and abide by the

"Student-Athlete Code of Conduct,” Athletics
‘ Director Debbie Yow said. “A number of student

athletes have apologized for the situation and
recommitted themselves to adhering to the
Student-Athlete Code of Conduct.”

Cottle said Monday night that the fall games
are an important part of preparation for the
spring.

“It’s important because it gives us an opportu-
nity to, evaluate the freshmen,” -Cottle said. “We
can see how they react to competition. There are
a lot of guys better in practice than they are in the
games.”

Timchal could not be reached at her home or
office Monday night. .

The athletics department also said “specific
and additional initiatives” will be created by the
coaching staff to provide support for compliance
by team members. Worthington said Cottle and
Timchal will meet with their respective sports
supervisors, team captains and other athletes to
set up a list of events and educational initiatives.

needs to be in order to win the division.

Running back Ricky Williams would have to carry
the team and let the defense wiI1 games in order for
Miami to win the division.

Now to my favorite division, the AFC North. The
Steelers will ultimately win the division because the only

other contender is the Ravens. Ravens’ head coach Brian
Billick has opted to go with rookie quarterback Kyle ‘

Boller as the starter. Enough said. .
You don’t win with a rookie quarterback, especiall
one who is obviously not ready, and Jamal Lewis carmot
be expected to rush for 300 yards every week. Unless this
changes, Pittsburgh will effortlessly win itsthird straight
division title. . ‘
Yes, even after being embarrassed, 41-20, at the

hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, who are not all that
great, the Steelers still should win the division.

Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts are off to
a 2-0 start, which includes a 33-7 victory over the
Tennessee Titans, who I thought would win the division.

I will still stand by that prediction, because Titans’
quarterback Steve McNair injured his hand in the game,
which probably had a huge bearing on the outcome of the
game. »

The Colts will need to get a good year out of running
back Edgerrjn James and sweep the season series with
Tennessee in order to win the AFC South.

The AFC West will go to the Chiefs by default,
because nobody in the division has an answer for running
back Priest Holmes. , ’

Denver won’t win the division again until they get a
real quarterback. Jake Plummer is not the answer.

I don’t buy that he did not have talent around him in
Arizona when he had wide receivers David Boston and
Frank Sanders. If anything, they made Plummer look bet-
ter than he actually is.

The Oakland Raiders are aging. They need "to go
through a youth movement after barely escaping with a
win against the Cincinnati Bengals last week.

After some serious thought, I will go with the Bills
over the Chiefs in the AFC Title game. My opinion will
probably change several times over the course of the sea-
son, but these two teams appear to be the most dominant
at-this time. i ’

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports editor for the Pitt News
and has not sold out and become a S teelers fan after three
years at Pitt. He is preparing for what looks to be a long
season for Ravens fans.

Receiver catches touchdowns in first two career games

Brockenbrough, page 18

surgery and sit ,_ out all of last year.

Although the Panthers lacked the big—-

time third receiver that he could have
been, Brockenbrough knows sitting out
was the best for thing for everybody.

“It wasn’t that bad,” he said. “I knew
I wasn’t’ready, and the worst thing you
can do is have it hurt your team by not
being able to play at your full ability.”

\V1th 2003 spring practice rapidly

approaching, it appeared tobe his time to
shine. The Panthers lost last year’s No. 2

receiver Lamar Slade to graduation, and

No. 3 receiver Roosevelt Bynes left
school.

Pitt had a huge hole to fill, and
Brockenbrough hoped to be the man to
do it. Before he could get a tight grasp on
the starting job, converted safety Chris
Curd had an outstanding spring at wide
receiver, including being named one of
the most improved players.

Going into summer practice and
camp in August, it appeared to be Curd’s
job to lose. With just two weeks left
before the season opener, head coach
Walt Harris had still not named a starter.

Just a few days before the opening
game. against Kent State, Harris
armounced that Brockenbrough would
start because the player had separated
himself from the rest of the pack. The ,
long-terrn competition ,was tough on /.

“That’s football. Especially on the
college level, competition is there «no

matter what,” Brockenbrough said. .

“When you come to the next level,
everybody is ‘that guy.’ You think you
have the stuff, but everyone does. It’s
what I expected.” \

Now, Brockenbrough has the chance
to play with, learn from and teach
Fitzgerald, a player who many say is a
lock for a long professional career some-
day.

kickoff and I didn’t even see the dude com-
ing. He just nailed me. I don’t even know
who hit me, to tell you the truth. I got over
to the sideline a little dazed. I got up all
slow and stuff and looked to see if people
saw me. [laughs] That was kind of embar-
rassing.

TPN What’s your favorite sport other
than football? '

TG: Basketball. If I wasn’t short, if I was
my father’s height, I’d be playing basket-
ball. I love it. There’s contact, but it’s not

V football. Basketball is the next best thing.

TPN What is something that people
would be surprised to know about you?

TG: I don’t know. They shouldn’t be sur-
prised. That’s the thing about me, there’s
nothing [surprising]. Everybody, especial-
ly my teammates, if I’m doing something,
they’re not surprised I’m doing it.

TPN: What kind of music do you listen
to?

TG: I listen to hip-hop, rap and R&B. I’m

a big R&B fan, I love it. On Friday [before
a game], it’s my R&B night. I listen to it to
just calm my self down and relax. And on
game day, I listen to rap to get me motivat-
ed. You can’t listen to too much R&B to
get me going.

TPN If we were to take a peak into your
refrigerator, what would we ﬁnd?

TG: [laughs] You’d ﬁnd apple juice, prob-
ably some left over pizza, some chicken —
and cheese, a lot of cheese.

TPN If you could date any celebrity, who
would it be and why?

TG: Any celebrity? [laughs] I’m glad my
girl goes to West Virginia [laughs] Megan
Goode. That’s my girl right there. She’s
pretty, and I read an article about her atti-
tude towards people. You know how
celebrities have that stuck-up attitude. She
doesn’t; she said she doesn’t want to marry
a celebrity. She just wants to many an
average Joe. I’m not trying to say I want to.
[laughs] I have a girlfriend, but if I had to
choose, Megan Goode, oh yeah. Man, this
is one of the best interviews I’ve ever done.

TPN: Stop that, you’re making me blush.
