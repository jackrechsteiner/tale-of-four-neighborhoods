“We’re in combat

told his troops during
his campaign stop at
Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial yesterday.

Bush’s visit kicked
off a two-day presiden-

through Oakland. Today
at 4:15 p.m., Al Gore _ g V
will hold a rally at Carnegie - Mellon
University. The vice president’s "visit

Bush was introduced by Powell, who

The theme of yester-

and the time he didn’t
spend on ﬁring up his
troops, Bush spent bolster-
ing his character appeal
while questioning that of
his opponent.

“In a responsible era,
government must trust the
people, and in a responsi-

Campus groups, others protest Bush’s speech

REHAN NASIR
Editor in Chief ‘

Bill Seifert wasn’t happy about Texas Gov. George W. '
Bush’s speech at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial yesterday.

Seifert, a Korean War veteran and 38-year supporter of

A the Democratic party, said that he and other veterans wh

meet monthly in the memorial support Gore. ‘
' ‘This whole thing is out of line,” Seifert said. “Bush is
in the National Guard by default.”

Seifert, a Point Breeze, Pa., native, said he and others
would be supporting Al Gore today at Carnegie Mellon
University. 4 .

At yesterday’s Bush rally, about 700 people gathered
outside of Soldiers and Sailors to catch a glimpse of the pres-
idential candidate. About 60 were there to protest his mes-
sage.

“Compared to other protests we’ve had, this is pretty
good,” said Brendan Harris, a member of the University
Democrats. Harris pointed out that 15 University Democrats
protesters had arrived at about 10 a.m. Most were holding
Gore/Lieberman signs.

“More of us would have deﬁnitely been here had we

‘heard about it earlier,” said Matt Weiner, a Pitt Libertarian.

‘There was so little advance notice.” _
Weiner said that he had heard about the speech on the

‘a radio.

“We in no way support either Gore or Bush,” he said. “We
know about Gore [being at CMU today], so we’ll probably
have about ﬁve to 10 people there.” -

As Bush ﬁnished his speech around 1 p.m., more
Democrats showed up on Bigelow Boulevard where many
of the national television cameras were located.

Harris said that Bush exited onto University Place and
was brought around to Bigelow. 5

~ “I think a lot of the cameras picked up our protests,” he
said. 1
Many students from the Campus Greens party also

protested the event, handing out literature about their candi-

date and party. -

“We basically had three responses,” said Jim Mulligan
of the Campus_Greens. “Some people are really happy we’re
here and are enthusiastic. The Republicans are sarcastic
toward us, saying that we’re just taking votes from'Gore and

‘ the Democrats tend to get angry, since they feel we’re taking

the votes away.”

Mulligan said that about 15 Campus Greens spent most
of their time on Fifth Avenue handing out ﬂiers, but when the
speech was over they headed over toward Bigelow to get a
glimpse of Bush. - ‘

After the event, Mulligan saidthat protests would con-
tinue today. .

“We’ve got about 200 people on our e—mail distribution

« list, soI’msureatleastafewofthemwillbeattheGorerally

[today],” Mulligan said.

Cafe wins award

Last month the Cathedral Cafe received an Excellence in
Food Protection Award from the Allegheny County Health
Department. It was the ﬁrst time a restaurant on the Pit campus
received such an honor.

Glenda Christy, chief of the Food Safety‘ ‘Program for the
ACHD said that the Cathedral Cafe had shown extra eﬂort in food

' safety sanitation training along with corporate in-house training

sessions. ’ » . A

The Cathedral Cafe also had 32 of its food service workers
certiﬁed in food safety by the county.

To be eligible for the award, Christy explained that the
Cathedral Cafe needed to have a good sanitation record, no con-
ﬁrmed ‘food-bome illness’ reported and no enforcement action
taken on them by the health department.

Jodi Ludobici, manager at the Cathedral Cafe, said that the
training programs are in place to make sure the food going through
the restaurant is handled correctly.

“We make sure that nothing is left out on the counters, food
is kept at its‘ proper temperatures, and employees are constantly
washing their hands. The main purpose of this training is to make
sure food is fresh and at its peak when we’re serving it,” Ludobici
said. ‘ ‘

Rebecca-Vogel accepted the award for the Cathedral Cafe at
and awards luncheon given by the ACHD. The winners were
selected by a panel of judges representing the, Food Advisory
Board, which is a committee of food industry representatives who

_ -advise the health department on food safety and regulatory issues.

The Pitt News

After months of wondering whether all
ﬂieir hard work had paid off, Pitt Habitat for
Humanity program directors Chris Meaner
and Lindsay Pell were relieved and excited
to hear the organization was awarded a
$10,000 grant from Habitat for I_-Iumanity
International. A

In order to be eligible for the grant, the
Pitt chapter had to start a recycling program
through an organization called Aluminum
Cans Build Habitat for Humanity Homes.

Habitat members collected cans every
Sunday during April 2000 and turned them
in for a donation at the end of the month.

A Meaner estimates the group earned between
20 and 30 cents per pound of aluminum col- 1

lected during the drive.

Meaner said that the group received
support from its members as well as other
students on campus. He said he also felt that
Habitat hadthe backing of the University.

“Students would come every Sunday
and we would collect the cansfrom 1 to 4
p.m. — our group has been great through
the whole thing,” Meaner said

In addition to this program and with the
help of facilities management and the
Student Government Board’s
Environmental Committee, Habitat turned
co-mingled plastic, aluminum -and glass
recyclables into cash returns. Meaner esti-
mates that for that project, the group

. received about 40 cents per pound of recy-

cled material.
Once the recycling program was up

and rtmning, Meaner and Pell began

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2000

write the grant proposal. The two construct-
ed an outline the grant should follow.

“We put so much hard, tireless work
into it,” Meanersaid.

Pell wrote the grant over the summer
and sent it in July. This month, the two
received the news that Habitat was awarded
$10,0()0 out of a possible $30,000.

Although Pitt’s Habitat chapter was the

‘ﬁrst group from a university branch to apply

for and receive the grant, Pell said she never
had any doubts they would get the money.

“We knew we had a good program and _

knew we could see it through and that made
us conﬁdent,” Pell said. A

The group also received $8,000 worth
of lumber supplies from a lumber company
and an anonymous donation of up to
$10,000. I .

The anonymous donor agreed to match
whatever Habitat is able to raise, up to
$10,000. To raise the money, Habitat plans
a letter writing project, where each member
writes 10 letters to people asking for dona-
tions. The group plans to use the money
from the grant and from other fund raisers
for the house it is building in the Hill
District .

‘ Meaner and Pell plan on holding
Habitat’s second armual dance marathon in
February and hope to write another grant
proposal in the future. Meaner said that
since Habitat’s done it once, it can do it
again. ,

Habitat for Humanity is always seeking
new members. The group will have a meet-
ing on Tuesday, Oct. 31 in IP56 Posvar
Hall, Interested students can also e-mail the
organization at habitat@pitt.edu.

be the wrong ideas.”

By Bush’s’ calculations, “The crisis is
coming.” He said the rising costs of Social
Security will bankrupt the nation by 2037.

“The crisis is here,” he- said of the state
of education in America, saying American
students were “stagnating.”

Bush proposed improved Medicare,
increased military spending and experi-
mentation with charter schools and vouch-

BIS.

“I believe our public schools will rise
to the occasion [as they did] in my state of
Texas,” Bush said. “We’ll leave no child
behind in America.” , ,

Bush said he will work to restore
“civility” and “respect” to the presidential
ofﬁce. '

“I know you can’t take‘ the politics out

of politics,” he said. ‘Tm from Texas. I’m
a realist.”

- The red, white and blue cowboy hats
in the audience nodded affirmatively and
responded to Bush’s speech with the occa-
sional “Amen!” and “Give ‘em hell.”

“I’m prepared to assume the awesome
responsibility [of the presidency], and I
will be guided by principles that will not
change,” Bush said.

Vlfrth Ridge’s help, Bush hopes to
retain Pennsy1vania’s important 23 elec-
toral votes in the Nov. 7 election.

“If we do our job, on Nov. 7,
Pennsylvania will be Bush-Cheney coun-
try,” the governor said. -

He asked his supporters to volunteer
for the campaign to ensure his victory.

“I’m here asking for the vote,” he

said. “I’m saying to both Republicans,

Democrats and Independents, ‘I want your
vote.”’

Pirates’ hiring or McClendon
was a gooddecision

On Monday, the Pittsburgh

Pirates armounced that they have .

hired hitting. ' coach’ Lloyd
McClendon as their new manager,

replacing Gene Lamont, who “the-

organization ﬁred at the end of the
season. McClendon is the ﬁrst
black head coach of a major
league professional sports team in
Pittsburgh. - » ,

The Pirates made the ‘right’
decision in hiring McClendon, not
because he is the first black head
coach in Pittsburgh — in fact, that
has nothing to do with the correct-

ness of the decision ——- but
because he is the best man for the
job. '

For the last four years,
McClendon has been the Pirates’,
hitting coach, and during that
time, he has established a good
rapport with the players; he knows
them and they know (and like)
him, which will give him a great
advantage as manager.

In fact, first baseman Kevin
Young has been outspoken in his
support of McClendon, and catch-
er Jason Kendall said that
McClendon’s hiring will have a
very positive effect on the
prospects of him signing a long-
term contract with the Pirates.

Additionally, McClendon has

, played ball (for the Pirate,s,'a'mong-_ , 
-‘-others), arid although he was, not .
- the L greatest player, oftentimes, 5’ _
'me'di_o_cre. players makenthe, be‘st‘_‘_: "ff, .
vmanage'r’,s'.' For- example;Eloe'  j
’rri'ainager’ of the New,‘-York1:”' 2 
Yankees, has been a phenomenal V '1

manager while “Ted Williams was

a great player but a ‘terrible man-_
ager; Since he has played ball, ‘"

McClendon understands the play-
ers exceptionally well. , '_ 1
Although he has no manageri-

’ al experience in the major leagues,

McClendon is young and extreme-

lyi enthusiastic, ‘two things that‘ I

will help him all the more in the

daunting task of being the manag-. A
er of the Pirates. The Pirates cleaI-, {
ly_ have great faith in his abilities-
— in. ‘fact, when owner Kevin»
McClatchy and general manager’

Cam Bonifay compared their lists
of candidates, McClendon, was on
the top of both. - _‘ A _.
Next year, the Piratesgwill
move into PNC Park. Although

the stadium is practically  _
teed to fillup the first few garneg}-::,
after that the Pirates will need‘ to?

play well in order to fill seats.

Hopefully McClendon will Ehelpp,‘
the Pirates gain a much better at

record next season.
Here’s to hoping.

nature -— it was something that I will never for-
get. .

Another part of the city that captured my
heart was the South Side, because I just love all of
the little shops and restaurants. It is such a lively
area with interesting people everywhere.
Browsing in thedifferent shops is a great way to
spend an afternoon. One shop that particularly
struck my fancy is a costume shop where you can
rent these extraordinary outﬁts, like ones ﬁom
movies or ones that people wore in
the Middle Ages. Another shop has
a ton of things that I remember
from back in the ‘80s, like Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, weebles and
Garbage Pail Kids trading cards.

On top of the shopping, South Side also has
a great bar and club scene — on practically every
corner of Carson Street there is a place to go grab
a drink with friends. The houses on South Side
Slopes also intrigue me because they all appear to
be so perfectly lined up, looking as if they are
going to roll down the hill at any moment

Now for my favorite place in Pittsburgh -
Mount Washington. When I ﬁnally went up there
at the end of my sophomore year, it completely
took my breath away. Acamera is a must-have for
this experience. The top of the incline gave me a
whole new view of the city —— not only did it look
amazing, but the houses on Mount Washington
itself resembled ‘some  I’ve seen along the
Atlantic coast. What amused me most, though,
wasthis streetsignwithapictureofanicecrearn
cone on it, indicating how many feet you were
from the nearest ice cream shop. Although the
ﬁrst time I went up there was at night and it was
absolutely magical, Ialso recommend seeing the

Now that I have shared all of my favorite
places in Pittsburgh, I highly recommend that
everyone go to visit at least one of them — I

tested by Vick  

JOEY MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

In the ﬁrst game of a crucial ﬁve-
game stretch that will close out the reg-
ular season, the Pitt football team will
travel to Blacksburg, Va., to face
Virginia Tech this Saturday, in a battle
between two of the top teams in the Big
East.

The Panthers have lost all three
games they've played in Lane Stadium.
Virginia Tech has won six of seven over-
all, including 30-l7 last year at Pitt
Stadium.

The Hokies are ranked No. 2 in the
nation and are coming off a 22-14 win
over Syracuse last week, which brings

their record to 7-0 overall, 5-0 in the Big‘

East. The win was also the 13th in a row
against a Big East opponent, breaking
the record set by Miami from 1991-
1993. ‘
Virginia Tech’s offense features
quarterback Michael Vick, wide receiv-
er Andre Davis, who leads the nation in

punt returns with a 22-yard average, and
a running game that ranks fourth in the
nation. ' . A

“They are a great team and a great
program,” said Pitt coach Walt Harris.
“Michael Vick is the best athlete I’ve
ever seen. He and Andre Davis are two
of the best football players in the
nation.”

That offense will be going up
against Pitt’s run defense that is ranked
eighth in the nation, giving up only 78.2

yards a game. The Panthers have given

up only 90 points all season, an average
of 15 a game.

“Their defense gets after you,” said
Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer.
“They play hard. Defensive back
Ramon Walker is something; defensive
end Bryan Knight is something. They
know what they are doing.’_’

Pitt is coming off a 42-26 win over
Boston College, improving its record to
5-1 overall, 2-1 in the Big East. The last
time the Panthers started this well was in

1997: Panthers stun Hokies, 30-23

Editor's Note: This is the ninth of the “Greatest Games”
series that will appear in The Pitt News the day before
each Pitt football game this year. Each part in the series
will detail Pitt’s greatest game against that week’s oppo-
nent, and will contain the original game story as it
appeared in The Pitt News. This story was published on
Nov. 24, 1997 and was written by Matt Townsend.

Three years ago, Billy West filled in for an injured
Curtis Martin and rushed his way to a Big
East Offensive Player of the Year award.
But since then, his career has been
derailed by injuries and a demanding
engineering course-load.

On Saturday, in his last game at Pitt
Stadium, West again filled in for an
injured starter —— Dwayne Schulters suf-
fered a strained abdominal muscle — and
rushed for 130 yards on 21 carries in a lit-
tle over a half.

West’s running, a dominating Panther presence in the
trenches, and a successful passing attack sealed a 30-23
Pitt victory over Virginia Tech. The win ensures Pitt’s
first five—win season since 1991.

“This win gives’ us credibility as a program and as a
team,” Pitt head coach Walt Harris said. “We beat cham-
pionship team.”

Along with West’s day, fellow senior Pete Gonzalez

  

culminated his playing days in Pitt Stadium with a stand-
out performance, managing four touchdown passes and
over 300 yards in the air. The senior now has a total of 25
touchdowns for the season, tying him with Boston
College’s Glenn Foley for the Big East record.
“This was a complete game,” Harris said. “This shows
that we can play against good people and fight and win.”
But Pitt’s best outing of the year had a dubious,begin-
ning. The Panthers’ first five rushing attempts netted neg-
' ative 3 yards, and the Hokies scored
field goals on their second and third
possessions of the game. .

At the end of the first quarter, the
unsteady punting of Grant Coffield
steadied as he popped one to the 6-yard
line, where Tech’s Larry Allen called for
a-fair catch.

Thanks to a holding call on a

_ Hokie first-down run, Tech was forced
‘ ‘ to punt before it could move the ball.
Jimmy Kibble got off a Wobbler, and John Jenkins
returned it all the way to the Tech 29. The offense could

not reach the end zone, but Chris Ferencik tattooed a 38-

yard field goal to cut Tech’s lead to 6-3.
On the Hokies’ next possession, three running plays
ended up just an inch short of a first down. Kibble

Don’t fear the reaper,
but fear LatefGrim

It’s a good thing that senior wide
receiver Latef Grim was invited to play
in the East-West Shrine Classic in San
Francisco after the season isiover.

That’s about all the good news Grim
has heard so far this season. ‘

_ After suffering an ankle injury in the
first .,of two preseason scrimmages at
Three Rivers Stadium,‘ Grim -was hard-
pressed to get into the lineup for the sea-
son opener against Kent State on Sept. 2.

With fellow wideout Antonio Bryant
suspended for the game because of his

involvement inmthe misuse of a faculty
' phone access code last year, Grim played
against the Golden Flashes .and pulled
‘ down four catches for 85 yards.

Things were looking up for the

Stockton, Calif., native, coming off a 75-

reception season in 1999 for 1,106 yards
and four touchdowns. ‘ ,

VVith four catches in the
first game, Grim was just 21
away from tying Dietrich
Jells’ all-time Pitt record of 160.

Grim’ is still looking to tie
Jells, three away from the mark,
as the, Panthers head‘ into their
seventh game vs. Virginia Tech
tomorrow. '

What has happened to .
the Panthers’ threat? Is it as
head coach Walt Harris
described after this past

1

Boston College?

, “John has been more comfortable
throwing to Bryant’s side of the ﬁeld,”
Harris said. “We have to ' get John to

, throw more to Latef and get him in the

game, too.”

Oh, blaming 'I‘urman’s reads for
Grim’s statistical downfall, huh?

“I did look to him ‘a few times,”
'I‘urman said. “Latef’s still a big part of
this offense.”

With 22 receptions for 308 yards and

u no touchdowns thus far, Grim is on pace

for just 40 catches for about 565 yards.

Those numbers are way down from
Grim’s- first two seasons as a Panther, but
there is more involved than just numbers.

First, you have to take into account
the emergence of Bryant, a sophomore.
He has consistently beaten both single
and double coverage, and it’s hard ' to
miss him when he’s wide open.

Also, the Panthers are 5-1 and enjoy-
ing Harris’ best season as a head coach.

With three very winnable games still
on the schedule at Temple and at home
against North Carolina and West
Virginia, individual stats should be
avoided when it is for the beneﬁt of the
team. ‘ ' 0

Still, there are some that say Grim is
complacent and is ﬁnding smaller ways

   
  
   
   

Braid Cuprik

. This guy was on thecover of the Pitt ,

media guide, ‘on the news, in the ;‘people

to watch” lists, and called the best receiv- .

er in the Big East by some.

Now he’s noteven the best receiver

on his own team. Bryant has sped by
Grim like he does opponents’ defensive
backs.

To quote a very odd T—shirt I saw, ‘
Bryant should be .telling Grim’, “I drive " S

by you so much, I should pay you a toll.”
Of course, that was ‘a basketball shirt.

The Hokies and other teams that face '

the Panthers the rest of the season would
best consider both players to be top-
notch and worthy of changes in game
plans.

If a team double—covers Bryant,
Grim can still beat anyone one-on-one,
and vice versa. -

I would go so far as to say double-
covering Grim would be a
poor defensive decision,
given Bryant’s ability.

Teams carmot put two
defensive backs on each receiv-
_ er, because the pressure that is
. ’ put on the linebackers and
G defensive front may be too much,

A and Kevan Barlow is a capa-
ble rimning back.

That brings me to the
point of this column. Has
Grim "lost a step? What is
the real reason he has not
broken the record already?

‘ Watch closely the coverage that Tech
applies to the Pitt receivers on Saturday
and make your own decisions.

Grim. is not a has-been, not even
close. He’s the first one to congratulate

Bryant after big plays," and expects .

Bryant to be therefor him. It is a’ team
game, and the two dynamic wide

receivers use each other’s strengths to

make the other better.

Bryant has gotten his turn, and now
it is time for Grim to shine.

a Go ahead,‘ Frank Beamer, double-
cover Bryant. No. 83 will make you wish
you hadn’t.’ Don’t forget about Rod
Rutherford, either. - ’

Considering I picked Pitt to have a
letdown in yesterday’s Spread ‘Em col-
umn, I don’t want to straddle the fence
and say Pitt will win. . \

Turman still has to be on, the running
game still needs to be effective, and the
defense must still find a way to contain
Michael Vick.

As far as Grim goes, however, don’t

worry. He’s too good of a receiver and .

too good of a team player. ,

. Brad Cuprik is the assistant sports editor -
of The Pitt News and thinks that Grim“-

will be the Reaper if Pitt does defeat
Virginia Tech on Halloween weekend.

HOKIES

1991, when they began the season 5-0.

If Pitt is going to win its first game
in Lane Stadium, they are going to have
to do" two things — the defense must
shut down the running game and the
offense has to take the crowd out of the
garfre. early.

Last week against Syracuse, Lee
Suggs ran for 91 yards and two touch-
downs for the Hokies. He has 14 touch-
downs for the season.

Pitt also has to contain Michael
Vick. He has eight rushing touchdowns
on the season, including a 55-yard run
last week.

“Vick is a hell of a player,” said Pitt
safety Mark Ponko. “We have to watch
for the cut back.” ~

“It is a challenge,” Harris said. “We

1 FROM PAGE 8

I didn’t feellike we played as. well as a
team in Syracuse and it was the same

environment. Noise is something you
have towork on.” .

Harris went on to say that he has to
discipline the players to do their jobs.
The players agree that the crowd noise
maybe a problem.

“Our goal is to try to quiet the
crowd,” Ponko said.

The best way to quiet the crowd-is  ~

to score early. The easiest way for the
Pitt offense to accomplish this is to
replicate the performance it had last
week against Boston College. In that
game, the Panthers racked up over 500

total yards and had a 200-yard rusher ; A I
and a 200-yard receiver for the,“_fi‘rSt: time '

in school history. ,

Running back Kevan Barlow
rushed for 209 yards and a touchdown,
while wide receiver Antonio Bryant had
222 yards receiving. Bryant was named
the Big East Offensive Player of the
Week for the second time this season.
He is also first in the nation with 140.6
receiving yards a game. ‘

“Antonio Bryant is gifted and the
other guys help him,” Beamer said.
“That whole‘ package, makes it tough.
They wore us out last year.”

Last year, Bryant and senior wide
receiver Latef Grim combined for 25
receptions for 403 yards, while quarter-
back David Priestley was 28 of 46 pass-
ing for 407 yards.

This year, however, John 'I‘urman
gets the start. He completed 16 of 29

passes for 332 yards and ﬁve touch-—

downs last week against the Eagles.

He is fourth in the nation with a
160.1 passer efficiency. Turman will be
playing against a Virginia Tech defense
that is struggling with youth and
injuries.

A Panther win could put Pitt back in
the national rankings for the first time
since 1991 and would hurt Virginia
Tech’s shot at a national championship.

“I don’t want to think about that,”
Harris said. “I spend all my time to
make it happen. If it happens, then there
will be plenty of time to talk about it.”

 FROM PAGE 8

boomed a 66-yard punt far over
Jenkins’ head for a Pitt touchback.

The teams traded unsuccessful
drives in their next possessions, but
Gonzalez would hit Murphy for a
touchdown just before the half ended
to give Pitt a 9-6 lead at the break.

Pitt’s second possession after
halftime started at its 42. After a false
start sent Pitt back 5 yards, West
zigzagged his way for 16 yards and a
first down.

Three plays later, on a second and
13, Gonzalez hit sophomore Andy
Molinaro for a 40-yard touchdown.
After Ferencik’s extra point was
blocked, Pitt led 15-6..

“At halftime, [offensive coordi-

 .T

nator Steve] Mooshagian told me we
were going to run that play again
because I was open on it on the sec-
ond play of the game, but Pete got
sacked,” said Molinaro.

Back—to—back sacks by lineback-
ers Rod Humphrey and Bryan Jacobs
stalled Tech’s next possession; But
the Hokies stripped Murphy of the
ball on Pitt’s next possession and ran
the fumble back for a‘ score to cut
Pitt’s lead to 15-13.

The Panthers would answer
quickly on a 35-yard touchdown
strike to a wide—open Juan Williams.
On the play, Williams fought off a
jam by a Tech safety, who then
blitzed, leaving the tight end open.

After a Hokie field goal, fresh-
man running back Kevan Barlow
ﬂared out of the backfield, and

Gonzalez hit him for a 56-yard touch-
down, giving Pitt a 30-16 lead with
five minutes remaining.

Tech then countered with a two-
minute, nine-play,’ 67-yard drive,
trimming the lead to 30-23.

Pitt took over after a short kickoff
but stalled after a quick West first
down. After two plays and a penalty
netted 3 yards, the Panthers were
faced with a third—and-7 with 1:53
remaining.

Instead of going back to the
ground, Gonzalez connected with
Molinaro for a 29-yard gain to seal
the contest.-

“I told Pete in the huddle that if
he was playing me tight I would run
the fade. He was and Pete threw a
nice pass that I was lucky enough to
catch,” Molinaro said.
