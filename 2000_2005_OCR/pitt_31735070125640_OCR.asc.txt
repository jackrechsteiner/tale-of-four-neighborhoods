Hotel Schenley hosts

ERIC LIDJI \
Senior Staff Writer
At the turn of the 20th century, the
William Pitt Union was not for students, but
for stars. As Hotel Schenley, it hosted some

n - A of the most famous and beloved public ﬁg-
: ures of the time. . A

 

The luxury hotel’s
heyday began in 1909

, when the Pirates base-
‘ ball team moved to
Forbes Field, across

Schenley. Visiting players stayed at the
Schenley. Preseason drafts were held there,
and important trades were signed over
mealsinits lavish ballroom.

Racism forum
encourages
student action  

RENEE ALEERTS
The Pitt News

The prevailing message at the
Fighting Racism on Campus panel dis-

cussion, sponsored by the International‘

Socialist'Organization last night, was
that individuals have the power to fight
racism.

“Can we look beyond color? Can
you look at me and say, ‘That’s
Mutale,’ not ‘That’s a black person?”’
asked Mutale Chisanga, a Chatham
College freshman from Zambia. ‘

Pitt ‘senior Sara Dadlani was the
evening’s,first speaker.

“Everywhere we go, we’re going
to face racism,” Dadlani said. “In India

-they face it. Here we face it, so we do

our small bit.” She spoke of her shock
at V her fellow Americans’ behavior
when she recently visited India, where
racial issues troubled her. ,

“At times I felt like I was traveling
with these 19th century imperialists
who had total disregard for the people
they were supposed -to be learning
from,” she continued. She expressed
her pain at hearing Indian people
dream about America, and contrasting
their dreams, with the reality she has
experienced. “I’ve lived here my
entire life, and I have never experi-
enced freedom,” she said.

Chisanga also expressed her per-
sonal conﬂict with America.

“The more I want to be American,
the more I lose Mutale, the more I lose
who‘ I am,” she said. She recounted
several experiences with racism and

stereotypes from Americans, including
one man who, when he discovered she
was from Africa, said, “Wearing
clothes must be a new experience for
you.” '

Chisanga went on to describe her
experiences with racism at Chatham.

“Despite the fact that it seems to be
subtle, it is easy to identify groups,”
she said, describing how Hispanic,
black and gay students sit in separate
groups in the cafeteria.

A She also places power in individu-
als to combat racism, saying that the
easiest way to fight it is to walk up to
one of the groups and start talking.

Chisanga became involved with

the forum when she met Sara Grey, a
Chatham senior, and a member of the
International Socialist Organization.
Grey encouraged her to speak, con-
vincing her that it was for a good
cause. Chisanga already had back-
ground as an activist from being
involved in issues on race and gender
in Zambia. Chisanga expressed her
goals for the forum.
_ “Fm hoping we can break down
the barriers of looking at someone as a
black person or a white person or
Hispanic — cutting down the barriers
of race,” she said.

Grey spoke next. She shared the

‘experience that drove her to become

involved with the issue of race. One
morning last year, she awakened to dis-
cover the first two ﬂoors of her dormi-
tory coveredin grafﬁti of racist slurs.

A recent decision by the department of residence life to stop cleaning bathrooms
in some residence halls has left this commode in Sutherland Hall littered.

University terminates
cleaning services

J USTIN' MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

For Krystle Williams, the depart-
ment of residence life’s new policy

discontinuing lbathroom—cleaning ser-

vices is a costly hassle. ' A

“I think it sucks,” Williams said.
“I have to spend money to_buy clean-
ing supplies even though I already pay
tuition and room and board. [I] proba-
bly pay the same amount or even more
than last year when my bathrooms
were cleaned.”

This sophomore is not the only
student peeved about the new policy:
semi—private bathrooms in
Brackenridge, Bruce, Amos and
Forbes residence halls must be
cleaned by the residents now.

Semi—private means the bath-
rooms are shared by roommates in
only one or two rooms and are located
in of the residents’ room, unlike the
open population toilets and‘ showers
found in halls such as Towers and
Lothrop. Those bathrooms will con-
tinue to be cleaned by the mainte-
nance staff. '

Dan Isaacsohn, a sophomore liv-
ing in a four-person suite in
Brackenridge, was unaware of the
new policy. Isaacsohn said he and his
suitemates have kept the bathroom in
“moderately good condition” for the

two weeks they’ve lived on campus,
but that he’s “definitely going to pay
more attention to it from now on.”

Pitt enacted the new policy after
conferring with residence life, the
Resident Student Association and the
department of housing services.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said
that the decision not to clean the semi-
private bathrooms was two—fold.

“First, the University wishes not
to invade the privacy of students by
entering their rooms to clean their
baths,” Hill said. “Secondly, it has
become a challenge to clean the bath-
rooms in the midst of personal effects
that students would accumulate.”

Hill did not know what sort of
actions would be taken against ‘stu-
dents who left their bathrooms in dis-
array at the end of the year.

“Whatever the normal policies
when the‘ students leave their rooms
will be enforced with the bathrooms
as well,” he said.

Hill added that Pitt would not pro-
vide any cleaning supplies.

Williams has. at least learned to
live with the change. She and her four
suitemates in Brackenridge do not
have a set schedule for cleaning their
bathrooms but each tries to help keep
them neat. A

“We just try to keep it up and not
make to many messes,” she said.

Up to theirneckszcollege students and debt

JENNIFER HALLMARK & RYAN LEE 
The Auburn Plainsman '7

In 1999,_ Joe Sirnms, a junior at

Auburn University, received a pre-
"approved credit card in the mail. Thinking

that he would use it only for emergencies,
he applied forg.-tlre card.
' “I ﬁgured I’d be responsible. I wasn’t

I worried at the time,” Simrns said.

Three ‘ months later, when his bank

_ account ran dirt,‘ he began charging every-
‘ thing and racked up a large debt.

Simms, a May 2001 graduate, is still
paying off his card. He pays $45 to $100 a
month;_to keep the interest from accruing.
His?‘ balance never decreases. '

= . "Now that he is employed, he hopes to
have the card paid off in two years.

,  “The most frustrating thing is that I
. keep paying the interest off and I’m not
’ getting anywhere,” he said. . . I "

When students allow their ﬁnances to
spiral out of control, debt can become a
harsh reality.

According to a July 2001 report by the

p U.S. General Accounting Oﬂice, college
\ students are in serious trouble when it

comes to dealing with debt. .
The report ranks irresponsible credit

A card use and repaying student loans as the
. major factors placing students in the red.

The vNellie Mae Education
Foundation, a non-proﬁt organization that

provides student loans, reports that 78 per-
cent of undergraduates possess at least one
credit card, compared with 67 percent in
1998.

A college student carries an average
of three cards and posts an average credit
card debt of $2,748, up from $1,879 in
1998. «c -9 5N

Nine percentfof card-carrying under-
graduates have a credit card‘ debt of more
than $7,000. _ * ' .

“Often it is easier for a college student
to get a credit card than a college graduate
with a job,” said Mike Reynolds, director
of student ﬁnancial aid for the university.

Credit card ‘companies regularly set
up shops on college campuses, setting up
tables outside student unions, offering T-
shirts and sunglasses as prizes for signing
up for a credit card.

Manyastudents apply for these cards
without considering the consequences.

_ The average penalty rate on student
credit cards is 22.84 percent, eight points
higher than a regular card.

The penalty rate can begin as soon as
a student misses one payment. Often, stu-
dent cards do not offer a grace period for
payment.

Having high, unpaid balances is the
fastest way to incur debt. .

“Credit-card debt is the type that can
get away from you quickly,” Reynolds
said. _

Credit cards do have some positive
aspects for students if handled responsibly.
The cards can help build a good credit his-
tory, which can aid students in receiving
loans in the future. Credit cards are also
handy in an emergency, and they decrease
the amount of cash or checks that one must
carry.

Student loans are another possible
debt burden that many students face.

The Federal Perkins Loan, Health
Professions Student Loan, Institutional
Loans, Federal Stafford Loans and Federal
Parent Plus Loans are available for those
who qualify.

Logan McLemore, a ‘sophomore at
Auburn, is using the Federal Stafford I.oan
for ﬂie second time.

“I wanted to have enough money for

living expenses and spending,” he said.

McLemore said that there is a good
chance he will take out another loan next
year, but he is concerned about having to
repay it in the future. '

“When you get out of college, you
want to start your own living rather than
wonying about paying college loans the
rest of your life,” he said.

While loans are a feasible source of
tuition for many students, Reynolds advis-
es students to be careful in choosing the
amount they wish to borrow.

“One way students get into debt is
when they take out a loan for what they

qualify for, rather than what they really
need,” Reynolds said. “Often they ﬁnd it
difficult to pay back.”

The ﬁnancial aid department requires
students to have an entrance interview
before they take out any loans, he said.
The interview prepares and informs them
about their payment responsibilities.

To remain debt-free in college,
Reynolds suggests maintaining a budget
and avoiding credit whenever possible.

The Nellie Mae Foundation offers
several tips regarding responsible credit
card use. Look for cards with low interest
rates, low or no annual fees, a grace peri-
od and beneﬁts to the card, such as free gas
or airline miles.

Most importantly, students should ask
themselves whether they can afford a cred-
it card.

Handling the burden of repaying stu-
dent loans can be made easier by keeping
a detailed schedule of how much money is
due and when. Making payments on time
is essential part of remaining debt-free.

Several agencies exist to help manage
debt, such as the National Foundation for
Consumer Credit, Genus Credit
Management and Debt Counselors of
America.

Sometimes it is also possible to work
out a payment plan with the credit card
company, which may slightly ease the bur-
den.

Elevators, cafeterias and
other hot spots for germs

PATRICK LISTER
The Pitt News

Snifﬂes and sneezes are common
sormds on college campuses —— students
alwaysseem to get sick just in time for that

important test or paper.

Anita Bostjancic, the administrative
manager of Student Health Services,

expects the oﬁice to become much more _

hectic with the arrival of cold and ﬂu sea-
son

reasons why students sometimes get sick
dining the fall semester.
“Ithinkthatgoingtopartiesis abig
thing,” Smith said. “Also, you’re around a
lot of strange people, and the city isn’t as
clean as some places, either.”
While the Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta could not be reached for comment

8 on ﬂre particulars of contracting an illness,

the Cobb County Board of Health in
Ivlarietta, Ga, continued that college living
conditions can be conducive to spreading
germs. 1

Joy Wells, the director of health ser-
vices at the board of health, said, “Any time

‘Steve Smith, a junior, named several ,

thatthereisacrowdofindividualsinasmall
area, they are always more likely to become
ill.” .
These campus hot spots include cafete-
rias, dormitories, elevators and lectme halls
Wells is an epidemiologist, a doctor
specializing in the ‘spread and control of
infectious diseases. She recommended that
all individuals, particularly students, pro-
cure the necessary immunizations recom-
mended by their colleges and universities.
Other precautions include basic sanita-
tion measures, such as hand washing, that

‘ everyone should take to avoid the  of

germs. p .
On the home ﬁont, Bostjancic men-
tioned that students should be aware that
Student Healﬂr is available in the ﬁght
against such illnesses. The service is open
during the week from 8:30 am to 7:30 pm.
by appointment and on Saturdays on a
walk-in basis.

This is the ﬁrst year Student Health has
been open on Saturdays since the late
1960s. Bostjancic said, “As far as everyone
here is concerned, this is a brand new prac-
tice.” Walk-in care on Saturdays is available
between 10 am and 3 p.m.

WPU, page 1 .

Eisenhower stayed in the hotel.

But in the late teens and early ‘20s, the
University developed an idea that at ﬁrst
seemed to add to Carnegie’s vision, but ulti-
mately brought it to an end. The idea was to
construct a 42-story schoolhouse across the
street from the hotel, called the Cathedral of
Leaming. . .

By the time it was completed in 1937,
Pitt and the city of Pittsburgh had made

plans for their -future. Both included devel-

opment and renaissance, and neither includ-

_ ed the Schenley Hotel.

By the late '1940s and early 1950s,

~ Oakland’s original founders and innovators

had died and the city had begun to revamp
Downtown. The University was growing
not only by classrooms, but also by adding
hospitals and other medical facilities. As

. Oakland was becoming the neighborhood

students are familiar with today, a hotel was
losing its charm — and its parking. ‘

Developers were building new hotels
closer to Point State Park, and Downtown
was beginning to ﬂourish as Pittsburgh’s
place to be.

‘ In 1956, the Schenley was through.

Pitt bought the building that year for
$1.8 million and spent another million
transforming it into a space for students.

Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld began
plarming toexpand the campus in the late

Hotel Schenley comes full circle

1950s, purchasing Forbes Field and con-
sulting with several architectmal ﬁrms.
Between 1967 and 1976 — just after
Litchﬁeld had ﬁnished his tenure - the
University started to implement the plans
from the 1950s. Forbes Field was demol-
ished and Pitt constructed Posvar Hall, then
called Forbes Quad. The University also
constructed Hillman library, and Pitt’s pop-
ulation neared 30,000.

In 1980, the University armounced that
it would spend 18 months and $13.9 million
to renovate the old Schenley. The expendi-
ture was slated not just to beneﬁt students
and various campus organizations, but also
as a measure of historic reconstruction.

The seven upper ﬂoors were gutted to
resemble the ﬂoors students know today.
The unused basement of the Schenley
tumed into the lower level, and a Forbes
Avenue entrance, made to resemble the one
on Fifth, was added. .

The University named the building the
William Pitt Union.

On Oct 1, 1998, the Union celebrated
100 years. The building was dressed in blue
and gold and the faculty tried to revisit the
hotel’s heyday with period costumes, horse-
drawn carriages and old-time celebrity
look-alikes serving cake. There was high
tea, the Pittsburgh banjo club performed,
and two students dressed up as street
urchins protesting the steel mills.

Hotel Schenley has come ﬁrll circle.

Panel seeks solution to
racial tension on campuses

Forum, page 1

She described her struggle in dealing
with resistance from people who think
she shouldn’t tackle racism. She said
people try to convince her that speak-
ing out against racists encourages
them, and that if she ignores them, they
will go away. .

“What we’ve found is that the
opposite is true. When the [Ku Klux]
Klan comes to town and they’re not
met with protest, they’re free to recruit
and do what want. When they’re met
with shouting and opposition, they
leave and they don’t come back. There
have been instances when they’ve been
run out of town,” she said.

Grey encouraged those present to
attend the upcoming national rally for
justice. The rally will take place at
Penn State University from Sept. 14 to
16 and will feature workshops, speak-
ers and performances.

Part of the impetus of the Fighting
Against Racism forum is to spread
awareness about the student movement
happening at Penn State, to encourage
students at other colleges to begin
organizing on their campuses and to
encourage them to attend the rally.
Several Pitt organizations, including
Black - Action Society and the
International Socialist Organization,
plan to attend. Grey asserts that soli-
darity is an important element in ﬁght-
ing racism and emphasized attendance
to the rally.

“This is the biggest inspiration that
an activist, or someone who wants to
be an activist, can get,” she said.

LaKeisha Wolf and Sharleen
Morris are current or former Penn State
University students who were directly
involved last year with the racially
motivated threatening hate mail and

hateful‘ acts that spurred weeks of
protest and student unrest on their carn-
pus. They worked to bring attention to
these events and worked with Penn
State’s administration to eliminate
what they considered the racist climate
that allowed such acts to occur.

Wolf described the attitudes and
environment that led to the hate mail
and ensuing events, saying that it
began with Penn State’s ﬁrst losing
football season in years. She said that
Penn State’s seclusion and proximity to
many white supremacist groups gives
way to hostile attitudes.

“At Penn State, football is the only
thing that really brings people togeth-
er,” Wolf said. “But when they start
losing, people think, ‘These black foot-
ball players can’t play football so what
do we need them here for?”’

Morris elaborated on the causes.

, “It was an issue of climate,” she
said. “People on campus were comfort-
able calling [black students] names.
Black males were assumed to be foot-
ball players and were getting attacked
downtown, usually by white males
who were drunk.”

Wolf, who received several threat-
ening letters, needed guards at one
point. “I had to go demand security,”
she said, going on to describe the emo-
tional repercussions of the situation.

Like the other speakers, Wolf and
her fellow students also feel that end-

EDITORIAL

A new year requires new
dorm responsibilities

It happens every year just after spring
break Choosing housing, that is. So you
gathered a group of friends and decided to
live in Bruce Hall’s apartrnent-style dorms.
You hoped it would be a good middle step
for you —- remaining in the safety and
convenience of on-carnpus housing, while
providing more comfort: and fostering
more independence than your pie-shaped
room in Towers.

And for a bonus, you looked forward
to serni-private bathrooms. N o more show-
er shoes, no more trying to hide yourself
getting in and out of the showers, no more
stalls. Hurray for convenience and privacy.

What you weren’t planning on was
being forced to clean your own bathroom.
The University recently delegated this
responsibility to you and to others with
serni-private bathrooms, in order to protect
your privacy and avoid the difficulty of
cleaning bathrooms cluttered with stu-
dents’ stuff. ’

And that just might make you bemoan
the extra cash you’re paying to live in a
suite. I
But before you utter one more word
about the large chunk of cash you’re pay-
ing for housing, think about it: You’re an
adult, perfectly capable of cleaning your
own bathroom.

Chances are that if you live in a suite,

you aren’t a freshman and you’ve had at
least a year to learn to manage yourself and
your stuff. You’re already cleaning the
other rooms in your quasi-apartrnent; why
should someone else be obligated to move
your stuff in orderto do something you’re
perfectly capable of doing?

Besides, do you even want the clean-
ing staff to see the mess you leave in the
bathroom or the things you keep in there?

If your suitemates agree to clean the
bathroom every week, depending on your
number of suiternates, you may have to
clean that bathroom only once every six
weeks.

And before you begin muttering about
what the University owes you, keep in
mind what ﬂie University housing policy
states on its Web site. The policy guaran-
tees that housekeeping services will take
care of communal bathrooms, hallways,
lounges and stairwells, but states that you
are responsible for cleaning your own
room. This includes your serni-private
bathroom.

So it’s a tradeolf. Want the extra space
of a suite and the privacy of sharing your
bathroom with only a couple of friends?
Then you have to put ﬂie extra effort into
cleaning it. And if you ﬁnd out it’s not

- worth it, you can always opt for different

housing next year.

Remembering a passionate  
professor and mentor

I didn’t know that this day
would change my college career.

It was a nice, fall Friday my
freshman year. I had only been at

Pitt for a little over a month. That.

semester I didn’t have any classes
on Fridays. So- on that particular
afternoon, I decided to go to a lec-
ture at_ the ' University Honors
College.

I had attended a few
before, but hailing from
San Antonio, this one,
entitled “The
Latinamericanization of
the United States,” espe-
cially appealed to me.

A Although, I was
already sure that I wanted
to be a» history major, I
hadn’t decided what my

bine what he said with my own
experience growing up in a relative-
ly segregated city.

Not just_the material,_ but also
the professor himself, captivated
me. Standing in front of _the audi-
ence, he showed incredible passion
about his subject —-— passion that
drew the audience into the presenta-
tion. Rarely have I ever seen so

many hands shoot up
when a lecturer was fin-
ished. '

years I took two classes

to be. At the time I was
leaning toward specializing in mod-
ern Europe.

Even growing up in a city that
has a Hispanic majority, we barely
learned Latin American history in
high school. I had little knowledge
of that area of the world and,
although I was interested in it, other
areas —— about which I was much

more knowledgeable —— were my

primary concerns.
. That afternoon my perspective
changed.
The lecturer was a history pro-
fessor named Michael Jimenez.
Almost as soon as Dr. Jimenez
started talking, I was captivated. My
mind was running as I began to com-

ed in a Brackenridge.

In that time I became a devout‘

enthusiast of Latin American history

— something that I directly attribute

to his inﬂuence.

When our .modern Latin America class
reached the era§’;of_ dictatorships from the 1960s
throughjthe early 1990s, it became difficult to
leave ‘class-with dry eyes because of Jimenez’s
abilities to relate both facts and emotion. '

His passion for teaching was evident in the
fact "that, three weeks after having his kidney
removed because of the renal cell cancer that
would take his life less than a year later, Jimenez
returned to teach the tropical commodities class
with the same passion as before his illness.

But Jimenez was not just a brilliant scholar
and teacher; he was also a person full of love for
life and for other people. V

The first day of modern Latin America, a
class with 100 students, he introduced himself as
Michael when he shook the hands of students who
talked to him after class. .

During his office hours, throngs of students
waited outside his door. Sometimes I would sit
for an hour to see him for 10 minutes. Although
many people were waiting, whoever was in his
office at the moment felt like he or she was his
top priority. When he was once forced to hold his
office hours outside because then-Forbes Quad

bers that this was his time to speak to students.

Although I was never able to know him
extremely well he always made an impact on me.
He was tough with me when he needed to be, but
I never left his office without a firm handshake, a
pat on the back-and encouraging words. I always
took his advice seriously. Even his strong
Catholic faith —— something that fit well with his
left-wing politics —- inspired this admitted agnos-
tic. . '
His passion and his love for -his students,
though, never rivaled his passion and love for his
family. He was the model of family values.

The second-to—last time I saw him, at the his-
tory’s department holiday party last December, he
showed up with two of his three young children:
David, now 8 years old, and Eliza Rose, now 5
years old. A few friends and I, all upperclassmen
history majors, sat with David and found our-
selves taking history lessons from him. Even

clear that his priorities that afternoon were David
and Eliza Rose.

I The splinters ﬂy as two knights hurtletoward each
other on galloping horses. A minstrel
plucks to his lyre. No, this isn’t a’ 16th cen- ;

about 45 minutes from Pittsburgh in New Stanton, Pa.,
the festival runs until Sept. 23. ‘

an interactive play where the stage is four football ﬁelds
wide. This story takes place in Morelandshire, L a l6tl1
century marketplace during the arrival of King Edwards
andQueen Rosalind. As you may have guessed, the mar-
ketplace is alive with excitement as jesters try to impress

"each for Radiohead T-shirts and $35

~I0l'l'l6I'S_. _ W

' Jesters, page 12

Feeling sheepish

We were swept off the T in a sea of
emo glasses, cuffed jeans and Chucks,
and there was no longer any question
which direction we needed to turn to
walk the remaining 100 meters to the
Boston Radiohead concert.

Before entering the gates, my ﬁiend
Emily and I stopped to hand over $35

 

apiece on our tickets, and had no qualms °
about forking over a total of $70 each for 
the whole experience. Leslie Hoffman

The concert was ethereal, and as the
sun set on the glowing temple of a stage,
thousands of pilgrims paid homage to the witty and charming god
of rock ‘n’ roll, otherwise known as Thom Yorke.

But back to the T—shirt.

Emily and I each willingly spent a considerable amount of l

cash for a T-shirt whose ultimate purpose is more advertising for
the band, and that actually pokes ftm at the corporate world. '

“I have a paper that entitles me to the fast track,” the shirt jokes.

Who is the joke on? Am I really so stupid that I would not
understand the_ joke of the T-shirt? I still bought it, and wear it
proudly, yet slightly self-consciously. I feel hypocritical; the shirt
itself probably cost about a dollar to make.

And who is Radiohead, anyway, to mock corporations and
media conglomerates? .

Their record label, EIVII, is one of the world’s largest music
publishing corporations, and whenever ﬂrey tour, concert— goers still
must use annoying companies whose extra fees merely drive up
ticket prices. I

I can’t help but feel that the same icons who decry pop culture 1

are the same ones who drive it, and the people who embrace it are
foolish if they don’t see it for what it is.

Last weekend, I saw “Ghost World.” Thora Birch, Scarlett
Johansson and Steve .Buscerni are marvelous as uncomfortable
individuals in a world that just doesn’t accept them.

_ But Thora Birch’s character, Enid, professes a dislike for all

things popular. It’s extremely irritating, and she’s extremely unhap-

py. She can’t hold a job in any franchise — even though franchis-
es are, sadly enough, some of suburbia’s most proliﬁc employers
— and instead of following the directions of her proﬁt-driven
employers, she chooses to reveal the obvious and sad details behind
ﬂie cornpany’s sales procedures to bland and unsuspecting cus-

Granted, I worked in retail this summer, and found the sales
techniques I learned both deceptive and alarmingly effective, but
that’s beside the point.

The movie ﬂoats along, making ftm of people who embrace all
ﬂrat is popular, but at‘ the same time, Enid is a sorry character

‘because she rejects everything.

Don’t be fooled into thinking “Ghost World” is merely a mes-
sage against today’s pop culture. Enid herself may reject it, but she
loves the pop culture of earlier eras. The movie, too, is much like
Enid. It’s cool and shiny, and you’ll be cool if you’ve seen it, or in
some cases, even heard about it. And despite its packaging, it’s not
independent — it was produced by MGM.

I suppose the message for today’s column is not about really

accepting or rejecting anything, but rather about thinking. It both- '

ers me the most when people take things like Radiohead and
“Ghost World” at face value. Think about it; If you confess to be
against capitalism, big corporations and conservative government,
think about the entertainment propaganda you’re taking in.

Don’t be just another sheep.

Seven Channels

Post-Gazette Pavilion
Tonight, 7 p.m., $17.50-$30

Who rules rock today? If your business
is selling albums, you rr1ight—say Fuel, Creed,
Limp Bizkit, Lifehouse or 3 Doors Down. If
that’s the_ case, add another name to the list.
Seven Channels has the right image for
commercial success. Theirmusic is another
story.

Seven Channels’ most recent self-tiﬂed
album starts strong with a great guitar hook
Guitarist Dallas Perry suggests the band’s
potential, but as soon as the rhythm section
chimes in and frontman Kevin Kirkwood
sings the ﬁrst verse, the album turns sour.

By the fourth song, “Breathe,”
Seven Channels’ current and most success-
ful single, the songs blend together in a med-
ley of hackneyed sounds that resemble an
unsuccessful jam session at a Creed concert.

Here is a band with the talent to make
some good music. There is some solid guitar
work scattered throughout the second half of
the album, and despite unimaginative lyrics,
Kirkwood knows how to hit the right notes.

Seven Charmels is a young band that could 2

make something of themselves, but as a

band unwilling to do anything but regurgi-
tate the semi—heavy brand of rock music cur-
rently in vogue, their talent is lost. "

Seven Channels is content to surf the

mainstream wave as long as it pays. They’ve
got the right formula — some catchy riffs,
pseudo-morbid lyrics, four angry-looking
kids, and a major label to back the whole

thing up. The bandwagon is a ﬁne, ride ’

«assuming the desired destination is Total

WATCH
Oh my!

Directed by Tim Blake Nelson

OLIVER B. JOHNSON, III
Staff Writer

It was some time ago when Disney,
under a Miramax branch, green-lighted a
large-budgeted ﬁlm called “O.” Director
Tim Blake said he saw in the violence of
Columbine and other school shootings a
good environment to set an adaptation of
Shakespeare’s “Othello.”

Blake chose Julia Stiles, no stranger to
modem Shakespeare adaptations. She
starred in “Hamlet” and “1O Things I Hate
About You,” which was based on “The
Taming of the Shrew.” Unfortunately for
Blake, it was the reality of school shootings
that caused Disney to pull the plug on “O.”
Blake had almost lost hope, when Lions
Gate Films picked up “O,” which has
become its biggest ﬁlm released to date.

“O” takes place in a private school
where writer Brad Kaaya trades in warriors
of Venice for a basketball team called the
Hawks. Othello, the great black military
hero from the Moor, becomes Odin “O”
James (Mekhi Phifer), a talented basketball
player from the ghetto. Hugo (Josh Hartnett,
“Pearl Harbor”) envies of Odin’s success on
the team that Hugo believes to be the success

he deserves.

After Hugo’s father (Martin Sheen), the
coach of the Hawks, gives Odin the MVP
award, Hugo plans his revenge on Odin.
Hugo sees Odin’s love for Desi (Julia Stiles),
the dean’s daughter, as the perfect instrument
of his revenge. Hugo uses Odin’s trust to
manipulate love and sanity as this tragedy
develops. Anyone familiar with “Othello”
will know how this story ends, but for the
sake of those who have never read the play,
I will not reveal the ending.

“O” is shot in a very crude style and
seems more like a student ﬁlm than a
Hollywood ﬁlm, but this doesn’t detract
from the ﬁlm’s dark theme. Phifer plays
Odin James the way he played Sgt. Derrick
Hill in MTV’s “hip-hopera” “Carmen.”
Odin’s emotions seem over exaggerated and
out of place in much of the ﬁlm. I blame
these follies in the translation more than I do
on Phifer’s acting ability. Fans of Josh
Hartnett will be intrigued by how well he
submerges into Hugo’s sinister character,
and should be pleased by his performance.

The shortcomings of “O” lie not in how
crude the ﬁlm looks, or in its acting, but in
the difﬁcult situation the writer undertook by
trying to adapt “Othello” into a modern high
school setting. Though I didn’t read the play
before the movie, I looked it over before
writing this review. I came to understand the
problem the writer must have faced and the
solutions he opted for. If Kaaya lost some-
thing from the play, it was not the extreme
impact of its tragedy.

Panthers readyto tame the Bulls

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

After a dominating 31-0 victory
over East Tennessee State last week-
end, Pitt looks to continue its win-
ning ways tomorrow when it hosts
the South Florida Bulls.

Although Pitt‘ lost Antonio I

Bryant to an ankle injury last_ week,
the team did see the .emergence of

V key contributors Raymond Kirkley,

Yogi Roth and Lewis Moore. All

‘three performers saw their most

extensive action as Panthers.

Kirkley ran for 90 yards on 18
carries,_ which included a touch-
down. The true . freshman also
caught five balls for 34 yards out of
the backfield. On Saturday he will
face a defense that struggled might-
ily last week against the run.

In South Florida’s first game as
a Division I-A team last week
against Northern Illinois, the Bulls’
defense gave up 200 yards on the
ground.

South Florida’s defensive line is
undersized compared to Pitt’s

‘defensive line. Pitt tackles Rob

Petitti and Mike Bosnic outweigh

“South Florida’s defensive end tan-

dem of Chris Daley and Emerson
Morris by a combined 115 pounds.

across both lines, which should
open large gaps for Kirkley.

Handing the ball off to Kirkley
will be David Priestley, who
remains the starter after a 15—of-20
performance last week that included
134 yards in the air and an 85-yard
touchdown run. Backup Rod
Rutherford will continue to see time
as well.

Bryant is not expected to play
tomorrow, so the threesome of R.J.
English, Lamar Slade and Roth will
step in to. serve as Priestley and
Rutherford’s primary targets.

Roth, a sophomore, surprised
many last week when he pulled in
five catches for 50 yards. Roth was
a walk-on last season and is now a
key factor in the passing game.

- English stepped in as the top
option last week, catching five balls
for 77 ‘yards and a touchdown.
English (6-foot-3, 215 pounds) and
fellow senior Slade (6-foot—4, 205 ’

South Florida meets Pitt for first time

~ MATT WEIN
The Pitt News

Are you sick of hearing about firsts yet?

The first game at Heinz Field and the first
game for Pitt tailback Raymond Kirkley and
receiver Yogi Roth are hot topics in the realm of
Pittsburgh sports. Here’s another: Pitt and South
Florida will meet on the gridiron for the first
time this Saturday.

South Florida is historically a dominant fig-
ure in Florida collegiate athletics, dating all the

-way back to the founding of the university’s ath-

letic department in 1976.

Despite its brief existence, South Florida is
one of the 20 largest universities in the United
States, with approximately 35,000 students
across its four campuses. ,

Formerly a dominant school in the Sun Belt
and Metro athletic conferences, South Florida is
now in Conference USA —— with the exception of
the football team, which remains independent.
The Bulls have 18 different intercollegiate
sports teams, and in the last 15 years, South
Florida has won 65 different conference champi-
onships.

South Florida’s football program was con-
ceived in October 1991, when Francis
Borkowski, then-president of South Florida,
formed a 40-person committee to investigate the
possibility of starting a football program.

After six years and a great deal of red tape,
the South Florida football team donned green
and gold to take the field at Tampa Stadium in

the Bulls’ first football game ever. They defeat-
ed Kentucky Wesleyan 80-3 that day, their high-
est scoring victory to date.

The football program was instantly success-
ful. In its first year of existence, the team fin-
ished with a 5-6 record, its only losing season
thus far. 

The next year, they improved dramatically,
going 8-3, never scoring fewer than 23 points in
a game. -

The Bulls finished 7-4 in each of the last two
seasons, but their scoring totals have fallen
steadily since their record season in 1998 when
they scored 402 total points.

Before the beginning of this season, South
Florida football attained Division I-A status.
This week’s game is the first that the Bulls have
scheduled against a Big East opponent.

Even though this is only South Florida’s fifth
season, it has 10 alumni in the National Football
League. Three of them, offensive tackle
Kenyatta Jones, defensive back Anthony Henry
and place kicker Bill Gramatica, were fourth-
round picks in the 2001 NFL draft.

Gramatica, a rookie with the Arizona
Cardinals, is the younger brother of Tampa Bay
Buccaneers place kicker Martin Gramatica.

The youngest of the Gramatica brothers,
Santiago, is currently the backup kicker for the
Bulls. 3

Though Pitt is the favorite in tomorrow’s

contest, South Florida is new in Division I-A and ‘

eager to make an impression by beating a team
of Pitt’s caliber.

 

What did you think of Pitt’s studentseating?

Not enough parking;
Corner seats isolating

To put it bluntly, I think the stu-
dents got screwed. Not only was there
not enough parking (that can be left
for another forum), but the student
section is worse than it was in Pitt
Stadium. The big problem lies in the
location.

In Pitt Stadium, you could sit on
the 30-yard line at the edge of the stu-
dent section. At Heinz Field, the edge
of the student section looks right down
the 3-yard line. They shoved us in the
corner! We’re not close to the team at
all. They used to be able to interact
with the students to try and ﬁre them
up. Now we are pretty removed from
the action. You can see who the move
to Heinz Field was for...not the stu-

l

' dents.

There was one more problem I
had. Was it me, or did it seem like the
band intentionally skipped or played
softly the part of the fight song that
goes _“Fight, Pitt, ﬁght. V—I-C-T-O—R-
Y” (aka Penn State sucks, P-E-N-N S-
T sucks)? Perhaps we should even
change the chant to “These seats blow,
T-H-E-S-E seats blow.”

Security guards force
students to sit down

As a senior this year with only
five home games left, I plan to
stand and yell at each and every
game. And I hope nobody is going

to tell me otherwise. My friends
and I didn’t experience any pushy
sit down requests last game, and I
hope‘ we never do. What fun is a
football game if you can’t scream

‘and have fun. How do they expect

the fans to cheer and support Pitt
if we are all sitting down? Ask the
players if they like that?

I used to be the Pitt mascot and
I quit because I genuinely missed
sitting with my friends and
screaming (that and it was hot as
hell in that suit). I was in shock on
Saturday when a fellow fan told
my friends and I to shut up. After
R.J. English got shaken up‘ and
was on the ground, me and my
friends tried chanting .“R.J.” to
help lift his spirits’, and a female
student told us to shut the f—- up.
I would only hope that if I were a
player who was motionless on the

‘security wants everyone sitting

field, that people would chant my
name too.

Don’t make the fans sit down
— not only does this hamper the '
efforts of the cheerleaders who are
trying to get us to cheer, but also
the poor mascot. As mascot, you
work hard to pump the fans up.
That becomes much ‘harder when

can be. Go Pitt! I

ﬁnal time tonight at the

I haVen’t seen every race, but I’ve
seen the big ones. I’ve watched the
Olympics and the Penn ‘Relays, and
they were amazing, to say the least.

'And even though I haven’t seen
them all, I never needed to. I could
alwayspicture them in my head, since
they were all the same anyway.

~ That’s not a knock on Michael;
that’s a credit to him. The man is in
complete control of the situation eve

2 time he’s on the track. I

I love it when the camera is at the
ﬁnish line pointing down to the last turn
of a 400. The runners, quickly come into
view, blazing off the turn. You don’t
even have to know what lane he’s in,
just look for the guy standing straight
up with his arms pumping up and down

, perfectly parallel to his body. Or to

make it easier, just look for the guy in
the lead. -

Either way, it’s always Michael
with that unorthodox, stiff, upright style
sprinting toward gold.

And it was always gold. The man

» never took a single silver or a bronze _—
p it was always gold.

To be more speciﬁc, he has a record

nine World Championship gold medals _

and ﬁve Olympic gold medals.
His most impressive gold and the
one he will most likely be remembered

for was his world record-breaking 200»

at the Atlanta Olympics. I can still
remember: I was sitting on the ﬂoor in
a Connecticut apartment for those 19.32
seconds with watery eyes. —

He already owned the record from
the Olympic trials a few months earlier,
but the, amazing part was that he
dropped his time by more than three-
tenths of a second from that time. I
know three-tenths of a second doesn’t
sound like much, but he did it in two
months, the same time it takes other
runners years and entire athletic careers
to accomplish. .

My vision was again blurry a little
later in the Games when he won the

’ 400, becoming the ﬁrst and only runner

ever to complete the 200-400 double
victory at the Olympics.

Michael completed the world
record double at the 1999 World

the title of World’s Fastest
Man with‘ ﬂash-in-the-pan 100-meter

champion Donovan Bailey after -the

Atlanta Olympics. _ ., 2

Michael pulled up lame halfway
into the compromised 150 race at ”the-
Toronto Skydome, and Bailey won eas-
ily. '

Neither he nor Maurice Greene ﬁn-
ished in their big showdown in the 200
at the Sydney Olympics.

People are‘ always going to have
questions as to whether he was actually
hurt or if he knew he had met his match,
butI’m not going to dwell on it since
there’s nosubstance to it. You can only
guess.‘ I

‘ To me, he’s the only Michael other

than Jordan worthy of "being. called
“Michael.” And just like Jordan, he’ll
be leaving on his own terms on the very
top of his sport tonight.

If you have 44 seconds to spare, I
encourage you to watch Michael run for
the last time, since there won’t be
another runner like him for an awfully
long time. Unfortunately, I probably
won’t be able to watch him, because my
cable hasn’t come yet.

But it’s OK — I can already see it
in my head anyway.

Hayes on the linebacking corps is strong side line-

' backer Lewis Moore. .

Moore started his first game last week, and it did
not take him long to get adjusted — he made eight tack-
les and collected a sack of his own. The only player

‘besides Hayes to collect more tackles than Moore was
safety Ramon Walker.

Besides grabbing an interception, Walker wrapped

ondary have their work cut out for themselves this week
as they face a tougher passing attack.

Marque] Blackwell leads the Bulls at quarterback.
Last week he was 17 of 32 for 223 yards and two touch-
downs, and he can hurt opposing defenses with his feet.

He delivered two touchdown passes to wide receiv-
er DeAndrew Rubin, who took one pass 57 yards and
another 52 on his way to the two scores. He finished
with three catches for 121 yards and is also a threat
when returning punts and kickoffs.

Joining Rubin are receivers Chris Iskra and Huey
Whittaker. Whittaker had three catches for 19 yards.
The third leading receiver last week was running back
Vince Brewer, who caught four balls for 27 yards.

The Bulls’ running game was futile last week as the
team gathered 51 yards on 30 carries. The Pitt defense

gave up just 79 yards on 49 carries last week. Much of

East Tennessee State’s rushing attempts were interrupt-
ed by Pitt’s defensive line. «

Pitt’s defensive bookends Ryan Smith and Bryan
Knight each recorded four tackles and a sack. Fellow
defensive end Brian Guzek was also active in disrupt-
ing the running game, and Darrell McMurray and Joe
Conlin kept the middle of the line stuffed up.

With the probability of Bryant not playing, Torrie
Cox should return punts and kickoffs. The younger
brother of NFL kickers Bill and Martin Gramatica,
Santiago, now kicks for the Bulls. The freshman kicked

Men’s and women’s basketball
season schedules released

Schedules, page 13

“We are excited about the schedule with
the addition of the extra two non-conference
games,” Howland said. “It will be important
for us with the youth of the team and will
allow the players to gain experience.”

The Big East Conference schedule starts
Jan. 2 at Fitzgerald Field House against St.
John’s. The Panthers’ home Big East games
include St. John’s, Notre Dame Jan. 12,
Georgetown Jan. 26, Villanova Feb. 2, Seton
Hall Feb. 7, Rutgers Feb. 21 and _West
Virginia March 2.

“The Big East schedule is always tough,”
Howland said. “Playing four of the first six
conference games on the road makes the
beginning of the Big East schedule difficult.
Overall, I think it is a good schedule and
exciting to anticipate.”

The Big East Conference Championship
will once again be held March 6-9 in New
York City.

Women

The women, just two’ years removed from
an NIT berth, will play 27 games this year,
including a game against national champion
Notre Dame. The season opens for the women
Nov. 16 at Fitzgerald Field House against
William and Mary following the men’s game.

“This is the most challenging schedule we

have faced since I’ve been here at
Pittsburgh,” said head coach Traci Waites.
“The non-conference games allow us to com-
pete against some great teams, and that will
give us preparation for the conference sched-
ule.”

The women are scheduled to make two
big trips this season. One trip is to Tucson,
Ariz., Nov. 30-Dec. 1 to play in the Arizona
Basketball Classic; the other trip is to
Cancun,*Mexico, from Dec. 20-22 to partici-
pate in the Torneo Cancun de Basquetbol.

Big East Conference play begins for the
women Dec. 5 when Pitt will take on Virginia
Tech at Fitzgerald Field House.
