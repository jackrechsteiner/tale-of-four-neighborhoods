The‘ gaping hole in the ground
on Forbes Avenue, previously occu-

looked like something out of

book, “Mike Mulligan and His
Steam Shovel” early Saturday
morning. ‘

If- you were up past '4 a.m."

Saturday and hanging around the
new phase of Bouquet Gardens, you
would have seen a parade of 250
trucks carrying concrete to the con-
struction site of the new Multi-
Purpose Academic Center. '

The process of ‘unloading the
cement-mixing trucks and filling
the space left by the excavation of
900,000 cubic feet of earth, was
expected to take between 12 and 16
hours, according to Assistant

ple’s own rhythms expressed in lan-
guage.”
I The ‘-‘Poetry Slamm Contest” is

nized members of the Pittsburgh
community for a staged reading of a

“My theater comes from what I
believe in,” she said. “I try to
develop [it] for the good_of the
group.” S 4- '

Lillie described Kuntufs work

as, “those creative works by man

that ﬂow from African, tradition,

traditions of art, philosophy, and

life that are I 'reflec,tiv.e of the

African—American aest-hIéftic,.”

Lillie and the members of the

‘ Kuntu, have p,er.formed_j‘theiri shows

not only in the Pittsburgh ‘communi-
tyxbut also in prisons and inner-city
neighborhoods throughout the
world. ‘ ‘ s ' ‘

The group has performed in
Ghana, Scotland, Canada and sever-
al other countries to expose nearly
25,000. people annually to African-
American theater. ' S A " '4

Lillie said that the Kuntu has

become the uplifting voice that

speal<s.about the lives and culture
of black men, women and children
which “would otherwise be
unheard.” ,

Athletes participate in
Day of Caring

A THE PlT|' NEWS

Staff Writer

- Between .the'cool of the morn-
ing and the stormy evening yester-
day, members of Pitt’s athletic

teams made their way through ‘

Oakland performing community
service. ‘ _

Approximately 250 student ath-
letes from 18 of the 19 sports teams
participated in the Day of Caring,
according to Athletic Director
Steve Pedersen. Only the men’s
soccer tcam was unable to take part
because they were on the road.

The athletes conducted a soft-
ball and baseball clinic for local
youths at Mazeroski Field, cleaned
the hiking trails in Schenley Park,

beautified a park on Frazier Street »

and trimmed the weeds of a hillside
on the corner_of Boulevard of the

Allies and Bates “Street. »

The athletes also took part in
Clean Sweep, a program of the
Oakland Business Improvement
District‘ program, in which they
cleaned up the sidewalks of
Oakland. ‘

“It’s really gratifying that all of
these. places that looked hideous
look really nice now thanks to their
hard work,” Pedcrsen said. I

Athletes were originally slated
to take part in the United Way Day
of Caring Sept. 6,.but because of
classes and other scheduling con-
flicts, yestcrday’s projects were
independent of United Way.

Pedersen said that the athletes
looked forward to the chance to
help so many people. ’ 3

‘-‘This is the first time that we’ve
taken such a large group todo in
one day’s work so much good ‘fo
Oakland,” he said. ''

Ilniversity of Arka

CURTIS MCCLANE

Arkansas Traveler

(U-WIRE) FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -

James Kelly, a 37-year-old graduate stu—,

dent, apparently murdered his professor in
the professor’s ofﬁce, Aug. 28, before tum-
ing the gun on himself, according to a med-
ical examiner’s report.

University of Arkansas Police Capt.
Brad Bruns said oﬁicers Matt Mills and
Aaron Mahon arrived at professor John
Locke’s oﬂice within one minute of a 911
call reporting that gunshots had been heard.

Bruns said the officers’ quick response
to contain the situation probably saved
other lives.

 

 

  
 

   

“We don’t feel like heroes, we were
just doing our job,” University of Arkansas
Police Department ofﬁcers Matt Mills and
Aaron Mahon said.

Mills and Mahon were on bike patrol
that day, Bruns said.

Mahon was in the administration
building, his bike outside, when he
received the dispatch at 12:14 p.m. Mills
was in the student union, and his bike was
locked outside.

Both anived across campus by 12:15
p.m.

“When I received the call, I tried to get
there as soon as I could,” Mahon said. “I
didn’t know for certain if they were gun-
shots + it could have been balloons pop-
ping or a cap pistol. I expected the worst

and hoped for the best.”

Mills said when they anived, the peo-
ple directed them to the office where some-
one told them three shots had been heard,
and they immediately cleared the area. .

“My mind was racing. I didn’t know
who was in the room, or how many. I did-
n’t know if it was a suicide attempt or a
hostage situation,” Mahon said.

Mills said he and Mahon were in the
hallway at the entrance to the ofﬁce and
officers Carla Holcomb and Mark Nichols
were outside on the south side of the build-
ing watching the balcony of Locke’s office.

“We were comfortable that we had the
situation contained,” Mills said.

Mahon said he was grateful for the
other oﬁicers who responded. Not only for

nsas professor murdered

UAPD of1"1cers,’but also the Fayetteville
police and ﬁre departments, who helped
evacuate the building, he said.

“It was a comforting feeling knowing
the cavalry was coming,” he said.

Mills said Mahon established verbal
contact with someone in the office.

Mahon asked, “Are you hurt?” then
said, “Come out, we won’t hurt you” in
front of the locked door. a ~—

“Yes, I’m ‘hurt. Don’t come in,”

_Mahon said Kelly replied. At the time,
Mahon didn’_t who was on the other side of ‘

the door. ,

Mahon later conﬁrmed the voice was
Kelly’s after listening to the graduate stu-
dent’s answering machine message. ’

Bruns said he arrived about ﬁve min-
utes after the ofﬁcers and also tried to estab-
lish verbal contact. 0'

Although he could hear someone mov-
ing in the ofﬁce, he received no response.

After about 15 minutes, Bruns said, he

. heard a fourth shot.

“I felt he was probably shooting at us.
I looked to see if there was a hole in door,’
Bruns said. _ ‘ V V

“I didn’t‘ see anybody scared or fright-
ened —— no heroes taking’ over —— just peo-
ple doing their jobs — what they were
trained for,” Bruns said. A .

“I looked over my shoulder and saw
Matt Mills,_ gun drawn, and I looked down

the hall and saw Aaron with his gun

drawn,” Bruns said. “I had all the trustjin
them.

“There will always be something spe-
‘cial in my heart for Matt and Aaron. Not
because no one else would do it, but
because they were the ones who did. They

protected me, and I knew they would,” he
' said. I o .
“lVIatt and Aaron are real deal heroes,”

Bruns said. “I bet I’ve heard that gun go off
5,000 times since [that] Monday,” he said.
After about 45 minutes, the

Emergency Response Team with the

Fayetteville Police Department arrived,
entered the locked ofﬁce with a key, and
found Locke and Kelly dead on the ﬂoor. '

“[1 was] more depressed that there
were two and not just someﬂiing self-
inﬂicted,” Mahon said. A

Mills’ was confused. “Why did this

happen?” he said “You always second

guess yourself in our line of work,-” Mills

said. “It is the nature of the beast. Wefeel A

we did all we could have done. If we had

rushed in, we could have giventhe suspect - ’
an avenue of escape, putting other lives in

danger — and our own.”

“We did this by the book,” Mahon  

said. “This was a permanent‘ solution toa
temporary problem.”

Mahon said that,inspite ofthe tragedy, 

“the response from the public has been so
great. Students, faculty and staﬂ have been
coming up to us and giving us hugs.”

“It’s good, to see us-accepted into the
university community,” he said.

“We appreciate the thanks, but we I S‘
. were just doing our jobs,” Mills said.

Oakland residents were treated to i

the sight of strapping young men
and women cleaning up the
streets on and around campus.
These noble cleaners of litter
were not ordinary students, nor
were they parolees serving
mandatory community service
sentences -—— they wereour varsi-
ty athletes, taking time off from
their busy schedules to partici-
pate in their own Day of Caring.
The program, an initiative
Sponsored by the athletic depart-
ment, involved all of the varsity
sports teams who were not travel-

‘ ing this weekend. Many athletes

participated by ridding Oakland
of litter and debris, while some

teams, such ‘as baseball,’ ran

sports clinics for area children,
Seeing the athletes in a posi-
tive off-field performance is sure

‘ to bolster the image of Pitt athlet-
ics among the student body and j
' ' the community at large. The rep-

utation of athletic teams tend to

_ become tarnished when a few or

even one of their members get
[into trouble; the. basketball team

_ is a prime example, considering

the Fred Primus -and Isaac

years. The Day of Caring pro- 9

vides the teams with an opportu-
nity to erase these negative
images, and replace them with a
picture of athletes as caring,
cooperative members of the com-
munity. ’ . '

Perhaps other student groups
should follow the athletes’ lead

and plan similar community ser— ‘

vice ventures. Other organiza-
tions, such as many of the frater-
nities and sororities, are involved
in a variety of voluntary activi-
ties; still there are many other
groups which could afford to do
the same. There are infinite ways
to give of one’s special talents -
the Heinz Chapel Choir, for
example, could sing at hospitals
and nursing homes and the liter-
ary folk at Three Rivers Review
could volunteer as_ tutors. I
Just seeing the athletes clean-
ing the streets may inspire stu-
dents to do their part, whether
that be volunteering themselves,

. or simply starting to throw trash

away in the proper receptacles.

9 One can be sure that the ath-
letes at Penn State don’t do this,
as they suck. We hear their

Bad, things happen to your best

friend when you buy his soul

In retrospect, maybe we should not
have taken “The Simpsons” so seriously.

but I didn’t care. I landed myself one deli-

It was this summer when three of my cious soul. Besides, I didn’t want to see

good friends and I were on a
fantabulous tour of Europe.
Somehow, in the duration of
our totally disorganized trip,
none of us mindless jackasses
managed to get shot, mugged or
beaten. Hell, we didn’t even score, but
that’s beside the point. I come to you to
speak of one specific night of the trip.
One that will go down in my life as some-
thing truly remarkable, even more
remarkable than the night I escorted the
German exchange student at my high
school to the prom.

It was a gorgeous Italian night, sung
softly in the fair city of Firienze (Florence
to those of you who aren’t knowledge-
able). There, in a beautiful restaurant nes-

tled in the city’s corner, under a warm ’
coating of white wine, I bought the bas-_-

tard’s soul.
; David Yankelewitz (pronounced
.Yank'-e—doodle—dandy) is his name. He
isn’t a sheepish man by any means. He’s
actually a loud, rambunctious powerhouse
who could decapitate a cow with his
hearty pectorals if he ever felt the need to.
He’s been my best‘ friend since
kindergarten, and now I own him forever.
He told me he didn’t believe any crap
about God, I said then let me buy your
soul, and so craziness _ ensued. A la
Milhouse and Bart (I guess I have to be
Milhouse) we had a friend write up a con-
tract and I received Mr. Yankelewitz’s
soul for a palt 10,000 Lira (the equivalent
of five bucks, or one ‘bearded Lincoln’
depending on how bodacious you are).
We signed the contract, but nothing
happened. He didn’t disappear, lightning
didn’t strike, I didn’t wet myself like I
usually do. Nothing. Fine, so I was a

any harm done to my best
friend anyway; I’m not some
"dastardly super villain, I’m
just that lovable nerd
Milhouse, remember?

Well, I think that whole
soul-selling business really did end up
screwing him. First off, he’s sadly been
cursed to live the next four years at the
most horrible place of all — Penn State!
No wait, if he’s going to Penn State I
shouldn’t pity him, I should hate him!
Die, Yankelewitz, die! I hope you burn in
your state—funded*co1lege with its beauti-
ful campus and prestigious faculty. Burn
i-nto a crispy beef jerky so that I may eat

filthy whore. _ "

Anyhow, other than that Penn State
stuff, good 01’ Dave, my greatest arch-

nemesis as of a weekiand some change N

also hit some serious turbulence in his
recent romantic history. He went through
the worst break up l’ve ever seen with his
girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. In addition to

this, his 2-year-old little brother hit him

square in the nuts with a plastic baseball
bat.

Surprisingly enough, all these occur-
rences happened just after I bought his

soul three months ago. I just hope he .

makes it through the year. _

What’s that you say, ‘kindly reader?
Give him his sdul back? No, I don’t think
wefll be doing any of that.

So, the moral of the story is — don’t
sell your soul or you could end up in Penn
State, too. Be warned from a man who
knows. ‘

I was very impressed with the athletic
department’s execution of last Saturday’s
game against Kent State. The end zones
were in place; so were the retired jersey ﬂags
that ﬂew over Three Rivers Stadium, as well
as various Pittsburgh ﬂags inside and outside
the stadium. Even a reminder of our nine
national championships was displayed over
the tunnel that the football team ran from.

The scene was set for an exciting day of
Panther football. The video that is played on
“PantherV1sion” (I refuse to refer to it as the

Dispelling
anti-Greek
mythology A

I would like to inform Pitt students of ‘

invalid perceptions in Justin McClelland’s
article, “Greeks warned about hazing” (Sept.

6)- .
The article mentioned that a “fraternity
house is considered the most dangerous

place on campus for a ﬁeshman.” That is far .

from the truth. In fact, fraternities can be the
safest places in all of Oakland to party, espe-

cially those on the hill, where we have risk.

management teams. These teams of sober
people are responsible for keeping the party

' safe while watching and attending to any

troubled guests. There is even a hospital one-
block away and we have a working relation-

ship with the police. You cannot get this at

any oif campus party. A
Rape was also brought up in the article.

This is my fourth year atgPitt and I have I

heard of only one brother being charged with

rape,andhecarnefmmafratemitythatisno'

longer in existence due to the poor behavior
of its members. ' ' "

As longasIhavebeenatPitt, the  I

system has been ﬂre victim of negative pub-

licity, though it has produced more leaders -

than any other student organization on {cam-
pus. Moreover, the system raises more
money for charity and participates in more
volunteer work than any other student group.
Downing Greeks because they socialize, just

like most students on campus, is ignorant ‘-

and hypocritical.

I am now embarking on my fourth year
as a member of the Greek system. It has been
the greatest four years of my life. I have met
so many interesting people an have learned

how tobe a leaderin social and business set- ‘

.  Ihave also metpeopleldo not like and
yet have learned the importance of being "

civil with them. To this day, I have'never_*
seen anyone participate in the Greek system i
and not become abetterperson in one way- *

or another. —

There is noﬂring wrong with ‘being a I ’
part of an organization that emphasizes _
friendship, academics and personal develop— .
ment. GotoaGreekftmctionandwatchus '

being with each other and will continue to

Bryant’s three touchdown receptions help
Pitt top Bowling Greento stay unbeaten
against Mid-American Conference teams

MARIO MACHI _

Sports Editor‘

BOWLING GREEN, Ohio --

.Maybe Pitt should try suspending

players more often.

One week after his suspension
for disciplinary reasons, Antonio
Bryant returned to the -Pitt lineup
with a vengeance, catching nine
passes for 180 yards and a career-
high three touchdowns, as the
Panthers defeated Bowling Green,
34-16, before a crowd of 11,533 at
Doyt L. Perry Stadium.

Bryant clicked with quarterback
John Turman, who replaced starter

David Priestley late in the first quar- ’

ter and subsequently led Pitt to three

scores in a span of four possessions.

Turman completed l2—of-17 passes
for 207 yards and three touchdowns.

“We’re thrilled to be 2-0,” Pitt
head coach‘Walt Harris said. “We
did what we had to do to win. We
knew this would be a tough chal-
lenge, but our kids came to play.” '

Harris may have been happy to ~

be undefeated after two games, but
he was by no means excited about
his team’s play against the Falcons.
He was especially disappointed in
Pitt’s running game, which garnered

only 36 yards on 35 tries in the

game. .._

“We have to run the ball a lot
better, but you have to give credit to
the Bowling Green defense,” Harris
said. 3 ‘ - 1

Pitt running back Kevan Barlow,
who had 105? yards on 21 carries last
week against Kent State, had only
eight carries for 8 yards against the
Falcons. - . _

In fact, Pitt’s'leading rusher at
halftime was third-string quarter-
back Rod Rutherford, who made his

. first appearance for Pitt when he ran

for 13 yards on an option play in the
second quarter.
Priestley began the game as the

quarterback for Pitt, ._but the game“,

was tied, 3-3, when Turman
replaced him with about a minute
remaining in the opening quarter.
Turman’s first pass attempt of
the game marked the only mistake
of the afternoon by Bryant, as the

» sophomore was streaking down the

right sideline and had beaten two
defenders,- but dropped a perfect
pass from Turman that most likely
would have ‘been a touchdown.

“I kinda got motivated,” Bryant
said of the dropped pass. “I told
myself to get in the game.”

Bryant said that the video prepa-v

The Panther volleyball “team
faced a crucialweekend, hosting three
teams in this weekend’s Pittsburgh
Invitational, but ended up 1-2 in the
tournament.

Arkansas, Miami (Ohio) and
Indiana all came to the Steel City for
the event. Pitt’s team, coming off a
convincing victory, against Duquesne,
sported a 4-1 record heading into the
home tourney.

“Coming off a win, you deﬁ-
nitely have a better chance of win-
ning,” Pitt head coach Chris Beerrnan
said. ,

The Panthers hoped to extend
their three-game winning streak with a
victory over the Razorbacks and
improve on their overall record mak-
ing the best of their home court advan-
tage. -

Pitt vs. Arkansas

4 Pitt’s first match was against
Arkansas, which was 0-2 coming into
the tournament. Unfortunately for the
Panthers, the game would mark the
first win for the Razorbacks.

Both teams-had a,cha_nce in the
match, but in the end, the Razorbacks
came back from a two-game deﬁcit to
get their first winof the year. The ﬁnal
scores were 15-8, 18-16, 15-10, 15-5
and 15-7, with Pitt coming up short.

_ ' Pitt jumped to an early lead,
controlling the entire first game. The
second proved to be a little more of a
challenge, but after some battling back
and forth Pitt. squeaked out another
victory, bringing them to 2-0 in the
match. .

Despite six service aces by
Marcia Thiesen, a member of the all-
tournament team, and a personal-best
66 assists by Carrie Norris, the

Panthers gave up two quick games to
the Razorbacks.

In game three, Arkansas
jumped out to an 8-2 lead before two
quick points by Stacy Renick, also a
member of the all-tournament team,
and Jen Nickels brought Pitt back. But
the Panthers cou1dn’t overcome the
Razorback attack, and Pitt lost the
game.

Game four proved to be more
Arkansas and less Pitt. The Panthers
never led during the game. .

The fifth and final gam
marked Pitt’s last chance for survival
against the Razorbacks. What started
as a head-to-head. match ended with a
Razorback five-point scoring streak
for the win. =

Pitt vs. Miami (Ohio)

The Miami team came into the
tournament with a 2-3 record after los-
ing to Indiana the day before, and Pitt
looked to pick up a quick win.

Miami’s record would soon
become 2-4 after a four-game contest
that Pitt won by scores of 15-5, 10-15,
15-0 and 15-3..

- The Panthers got an early lead
in game one with as much as a nine-
point advantage over Miami. Pitt
ended the first game on an ace from
Nickels.

Game two was the exact oppo-
site as the Panthers found themselves
at the short end of a 7-2 game. They
battled ‘ back to 8-7 on. aces from

Renick and Riggle, as well as kills bye

Thiesen and the rest of the squad.
Eventually, the Panthers fell short and
Miami tied the match.

Norris served for 11 points
with three aces in the start of ‘game
three to propel ‘Pitt to a shutout. -

Game four went to Pitt as they
raced to a 6-1 lead and continued
strong team play for the rest of the
match. Nickels. and Renick had attack

percentages of .421 ‘and .407, respec-
tively, against the Razorbacks.

Pitt V. Indiana ‘ '

Undefeated Indiana faced Pitt
for the ﬁnal- matchup of the tourney
after coming off a- win against
Arkansas earlier in the day.

The Panthers hopes for victory
against the Hoosiers were dashed in.
only three games. Pitt battled with
good defense but was unable to con-
vert on many of the offensive opportu— ,
nities and lost 2-15, 12-15, 10-15.

“Indiana? really has it going.
on,” Beennan said after the Hoosiers
won the contest. , a

“ Game one started off with
another Norris ace, but this firstpoint
would be the only lead throughout the .

game as Indiana surprised.Pitt running '

up 14 points before Thiesen managed a.
kill. It was too little, too late for Pitt as

. game one ended in Indiana’s favor.

Thiesen then. began * game two
with an ace and Pitt wasright behind

Indiana, trailing by only two or three
most of the game. Pitt tied things up at
10 with a Norris ace and took a 12-10

lead after some adjustments made dur-

ing a time out. Indiana then went on a

five-point binge and took the second‘.

game out from under the Panthers.
Alexandria Lacenere served

for two quick points atthe beginning

of game three. Renick and Thiesen
also had quick aces to bring the
Panthers ahead ‘9-5. The Hoosiers
slowly worked their way back among a

number of sideouts for both teams and _'
eventually put together streaks of two
and four points to win another victory.’ 1

Indiana came out on top,
retaining their undefeated status and
receiving the tournament title award
with a number of players on the all-

tournament team. Pitt received the run-' .

ner-up award.

Next weekend Pitt travels to A. -
the Wyoming Tournament where it will’

 BOWLING GREEN, Ohio —- Last week, I dropped a40-yard throw in the firsthhalf. 4 I

used this space to discuss the Pitt quarterback sit-

uation. David Priestley, I said, was
clearly the favorite of head
coach Walt Harris, but John
Turman also deserved a fair shot
-at the starting spot.

“ After viewing Saturday’s game

against Bowling Green, there was
only one certainty that came to mind
when thinking of the Panther quarter-
backs, and that is there are no certainties.

* Turman"’fplayed excellent football,
showing poise in the pocket and completing
1'2-jof-17 passes for 208 .yards and three
touchdowns. He would have had .a~ fourth
touchdown pass if Antonio Bryant 'hadn’t

Priestley didn’t do too bad, either. On. his first
, three possessions, the Panthers started
in good field position, with the worst
starting spot being at their own 40-
yard line, but Priestley only led Pitt
to three points in that span. You can’t
-blame the quarterback too much when
his running backs can’t hold onto the
ball. Two of the three fumbles by the
Pitt backfield occurred in the first
quarter with Priestley under center.
And then there is Rod Rutherford.
Rutherford, from Perry Traditional
 Academy in Pittsburgh, was supposed
_ to be the savior of the Pitt program,
when he committed two years ago.

We may not know if that was a good experi-
ment or not, because Rutherford was one of six
Panthers suspended in the season opener against -
Kent State. . _
against the Falcons. he played at quarterback 
instead of receiver. — ~ "  

Harris inserted Rutherford into the game .in the e 3
second quarter, and the redshirt freshman prompt-  _

-ly reeled off a 13-yard run. The only negative on ‘ 
the play for the Panthers was that Rutherford’s run   1

his success.

‘‘It’s‘ the film,” Bryant said.
“When you get on the field, it just
makes it that much easier when you
see it ‘happening right before your
eyes?’ . ,

Early in the second quarter, Pitt
took a ‘10-3 lead when Turman
found R.J. English for a 31-yard
touchdown pass. English beat
defensive back Ken Dobbs on a
slant pattern, and Turman delivered
the ball right in his hands for the
Pitt score. -

The Panthers got the ball back
quickly with a nice set of downs by
the defense. Faced with a third

down and 8 yards to go,_ Falcons
quarterback Andy Sahm dropped
back to pass, only to be sacked by
Pitt linebacker Brian Beinecke for a
loss of 5 yards.

Pitt then started a drive on its
own 44-yard line, and Turman threw
one of his few bad passes of the day,
bouncing one to Bryant. But on the
next play, Bryant went right down
the seam of the BGSU defense, and
Turman found him for a 56-yard
touchdown pass to break the game
open.

“It was just a great play by‘

Antonio,” Turman said. “He did all
the work. All I have to do is. get him
the ball.” ' S

Pitt’s defense held Bowling
Green to only three points in the
first half, and a big reason why-was
the play of defensive-lineman Bryan

‘Knight. Knight had four sacks in the

game, eclipsing his total‘ of 1999,
when he totaled three sacks over the
course of the 11-game season. '

“I watched a lot of film on their

tackles,” Knight said. “I looked at T
- their footwork, and it helped me out ‘

today.” . «
Pitt tacked on a 36-yard field

goal by Nick Lotz to take a 20-3 9
lead into the locker room at half— ’

time, but the . quick-strike Pitt
offense was not done.
Turman once again" looked to

Bryant to get the Panthers in the end, 
zone. On a first—down play midway _.

through the third quarter, Turman
lofted a pass towards Bryant, who
was running down the left sideline.

Bryant turned, saw the "ball, and " I

leapt over the defender to catch the

underthrown ball, and then backed .~

into the end zone, dragging the
defender with him. The touchdown
and subsequent extra point gave Pitt
a 27-3 advantage. "
Then, it was Priestley’s turn
The junior quarterback
returned to the game and, just like

Turman, looked to Bryant to pad his ,_

stat sheet. Priestley found Bryant

over themiddle for a 37-yard touch- , ‘

down pass that extended the lead to
34-3, and although the scoreboard

didn’t show_it, the game was over..

Bowling Green ‘added two touch-
downs in the fourth quarter to set

_ the final margin. .

After the game, the talk turned
to Pitt’s failure to run the ball suc-
cessfully, and the effect that might

have when the Panthers host rivals

Penn State next Saturday. ~
“We’ve gotta be‘ able to run the
ball to have a chance to be good,”
Harris said. “We can’t do that nex
weekiif we expect to win.” 4
Pitt is now 2-0 on the year,
while Bowling Green drops to 0-2
with the loss. Kickoff for Pitt’s
game against Penn State is sched-

uled for 3:30 p.m. Saturday at Three  “G ’

Rivers Stadium.

vaulted him to the top of Pitt’s rush-
ing totals, as he was leading the team

"at halftime with, you guessed it, 13

-1

yards. Showing the speed that made
him famous around the area in his
high school days, Rutherford gar-
nereda couple first downs on the
afternoon. _ I

Saturday’s game gave me a
change of heart. No longer do‘I feel
that Pitt needs to pick a quarterback,
give him the offense to control and
let the team develop around him.
N ow, I think this quarterback contro-
versy could be a blessing in disguise.

Think about it. Penn State head

coach Joe Paterno, in‘ addition to

having to worry about dropping dead

. any day now, also has to consider the

Pitt quarterback situation. J oePa has
to be thinking, “Who will Pitt start?
Who will play the most?” I bet it’s
killing him right now, just trying to
think of the answer to that. Oh, never
mind, his‘ old age is killing him.

The quarterbacks will confuse

Paterno, no, doubt, and that’s why

I’m endorsing the three—quarterback
system. C’mon, wouldn’t you like’ to

-fgsee -the Steelers do that with Kent
‘Graham, Kordell Stewart, and Tee
Martin? Ok, maybe not, but still  it

:could work. '

Now it’s gn to a matchup this

weekend with the Nittany Lions,
' who-Pitt hasn’t defeated since 1988,

losing seven games since then. You
know what. they say; the eighth time
is a‘ charm. ~ s

I ”“,iMario Machi is the sports editor of
“The Pitt News, and he is glad Penn‘

State thrashed Louisiana Tech ,this

 tweekend, because the only thing bet-
C-'7'tler than seeing a Pitt team beat a

‘beat an overconfident Penn State
team. - I

wards.

Rutherford was one of six play-
ers that were suspended for the sea-
son opener against Kent State for
disciplinary reasons dating back to
last school year.

In the week prior to the Kent
State game and this past week,

FROM PAGE 11

Rutherford was splitting time in_
practice at quarterback and at wide ‘

receiver. , '

However, he did not line up as a
wideout in Saturday’s win.

“I was expecting to see some
time ‘at wide receiver,” said
Rutherford. “But I came here to
play "quarterback, so it was nice to

 

 

-—..~s

play some QB.”

Rutherford came back into the
game in the second half with the
contest safely in the Panthers’
hands. a ‘

He ran the option on two more
occasions, collecting 9 and 2 yards,
and finished the‘ gamewith 21 yards
on four carries.

“He showed some athletic abili-

ty today, but the best play he made

was on the onside kick,” Harris
said. . _
Harris was referring to a play in

the fourth «quarter after Bowling__

Green had cut the lead of Pitt to 34-
16. I

On the ensuing kickoff,
Rutherford was sent out on the
“hands team” to make sure the
Panthers got possession of the ball

so that they could secure the victo-

ry.
Rutherford sprinted over once

the ball was kicked, leapt up in the‘

air and pulled it in. _

He attempted one pass, although
it was not an official one because
Pitt was guilty of a holding penalty
on the play.

Rutherford threw a’ bullet 25
yards"downfield, but the ‘ball was
too hard for t_ight end Brennan
Carroll.-

C/arroll put his hands up, but the
ball bounced off of them and fell
incomplete. A

No matter how ' much time

Rutherford sees in the lineup this
year, his flashes of brilliance. on
Saturday were enough to let Pitt
fans know that he has arrived.
