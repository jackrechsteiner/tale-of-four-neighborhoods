VOLUME -XCVIII, NUMBER 88

Lingering
jobs await
new   SGB  

MALLORY WOMER
Staff Writer

One era of Student Government
Board came to an end last week. The day
also marked the beginning of new hopes
to instill traditions at Pitt and create a
greater senseof unity among students at
the University. Former SGB president
Liz Culliton passed on her role at the
inauguration ceremony last Thursday,
allowing Brian Kelly to assume the task
of governing all non-College of General
Studies students at Pitt. ‘A

This new board faces, among other
things, a review of the student activities
fee. This was the focus of discussion at
the ‘last meeting of the 2003 board, and
now the current board must examine the
issue further to determine if there is a
need to raise the fee, according to Kelly.

The fee of $60 a semester is paid by
all students along with tuition. It has not

2 been raised in ﬁve years, a period in

which rising costs and inﬂation have
made it difficult for student groups to
receive enough funding. Kelly used the
vans that the school rents in order for stu-
dent groups to take trips as an example.
This year, the van company raised their
prices, while the number of passengers
who can legally sit inside was lowered.

According to Kelly, the change
imposed by an increase in the activities
fee could be beneﬁcial to students
because “students can directly see what
their money is going to.”

Another change that will be seen by
students is an increased push for tradi-
tions. SGB will be working with the ath-
letics department and Alumni
Association to “create and continue new

_ Many college students who have
yet to enter the wonderful world of
legal drinking are finding little to do
in Oakland establishments these
days.

’With the Liquor Control Board

cracking down on local Oakland

bars and restaurants, the under-21
crowd is left with few nightlife
activities in public, Oakland build-
ings. _ ‘

But Gus Grekis hopes that, by
the end of this semester, underage
college students will have a place to

hang out with friends and meet new
. people.  « ‘

It’s called Johnny Rotten’s, but-
Grekis says it willbe far from bad.

we’ve beenedoing it for many years,”
said Grekis.

With another 18-and—over club

“We want to make it personable,
but [the over—2l section] has to be

The cover charge will be $10 the

that fee comes free drinks. Johnny

those older than 21 years of age, and
free soda and snacks for. those
younger than 21 years. P

want to give back to the kids what

and old tradition‘s,” Kelly said.

The board also looks to involve a
greater number of freshmen in campus
lifeatPitt.  ,_ '_

C “Freshmen are a big source of Pitt
pride and energy,” Kelly said.

The third goal that SGB has set forth
for this year is to create a university for all
students to ‘use’. The board will work with
the administration on this project to find a
place where it is possible for “tons of stu-
dents to meet,” Kelly explained. Also
included in this goal is an initiative to
involve more minorities in campus activ-
ities.

Matt Hutchinson, a new member of
SGB, is looking forward to making a dif-
ference in the school with his fellow
board members. Not only is he excited
about focusing on traditions at Pitt, but he
is also planning on devoting attention to
his pla_tform, club sports. He hopes to
give them more power by uniting the

of power will not overlook them.

“If there is a uniﬁed voice, it is a bet-
ter way to get attention,” Hutchinson said.

Stephanie Hadgkiss, a member of the
2003 board, plans to continue her
involvement with SGB until she gradu-
ates this spring. During her term, she
helped to create the “SwaPitt” program
that will allow students to trade textbooks
with each other. This semester, she will
help to tweak the program so that it will
be a success in the future. -

Hadgkiss said that SGB, though time
consuming, has been one of the best
things she’s done. This was part of the
reason that she was reluctant to end her
time with the organization. A

“It’s hard for me to separate the per-
son that I am from the person that I would
be without [SGB],” Hadgkiss said.

The 2004 board consists of nine peo-
ple, including the president. Five mem-
bers are men and four are women: Four
members are returning board members,
and seven are members of the Greek

Protesting tuition

U.S. college students aren’t the
only ones, getting poked by sky-
rocketing tuition. Students in
Canada are feeling the pinch, too,
but some of them are taking a
proactive approach.

They are simply refusing to pay
their tuition bills. 1

Last semester, about 2,000 of
the approximately 21,000 students
at Simon Fraser University partici-
pated in a tuition boycott in light of
a ‘30 percent tuition increase.
Hundreds of students 1 at the
University of Victoria have pledged
not to pay tuition this semester,
after seeing a 69 percent increase in
their tuition in the past two years.

Kudos to the Canadians. It is
refreshing to see collegestudents,
typically seen as champions of apa-
thy, taking action to right a wrong.
Tuition everywhere is skyrocketing,
and moststudents simply groan and
dig themselves ever deeper into
debt. While it remains to be seen
what will become of the students,
their action ——-— or rather, inaction —
is inspiring.

It is worth taking into consider-

ation that in Canada, the federal

government subsidizes higher edu-
cation. A college education costs

considerably less up North than it»

does here. A press release from the
SFU Student Society bemoaned the
fact that tuition was approaching

ri (es the Canadian way

$4,000 a year. That is le_ss than half
of what a full-time, in-state student
pays at Pitt. _

_ Here at Pitt, we are no strangers
to outrageoustuition hikes. Many
Pitt students are so jaded that they
barely bat an eye at the yearly
increases. What if Pitt students
were to stop lying down and taking
it when the bill keeps climbing?

Some students have taken
action by lobbying in Harrisburg.
That is commendable, but not par-
ticularly drastic. The wheels of leg-
islation grind slowly, and most stu-
dents stop being students in a mat-.
ter of years. Refusing to pay outra-
geous tuition bills is riskier and
more proactive.

On such a large campus ‘as this,

it is an unrealistic idea. It would be

tough to motivate a large enough
chunk of the student body to make
much of a difference. If all Pitt stu-
dents did hold off paying their

‘tuition until the last day of classes,

though, they could leave a big hole
in the school’s finances for a nice
chunk of time, enough to send a
message. . A

We could start small, just
enough to get a taste for civil dis-

obedience. The Book Center has’

been selling books for a small for-
tune for years, then buying them
back at insultingly low prices. Wh
not refuse to shop there? . ‘

I never met a resolution I could keep

For the past, oh, ten years or so,
I’ve made and kep_t the same New
Year’s resolution.

I resolve to quit running over
nuns with steamrollers, and so far,
so good.

Now and again, I engagein the
silly and futile tradition of making
real resolutions, which never end as
successfully -as my proscription on
cartoon violence.

Not two weeks into 2004, those
have -all gone by the "wayside. I-
haven’t seen the inside of
a gym.

I haven’t cooked any-
thing more strenuous than
a sandwich.

I still sleep until the
afternoon whenever I can.

So, obviously, I’m
resolution-impaired. I
know I have some degree
of willpower; I haven’t
had a Camel in almost
two years.

I think it’s the fanfare, .
the expectation, the hyping of

January as some kind of personal

panacea, that leads me to throw in
the towel year after year.

Thinking" about it, I decided to
make some anti-resolutions.’ I’m
resolving to keep my bad habits,
and dammit, I will succeed.

So here are a few choice exam-
ples of things Ilwon’t be quitting
and foibles I won’t be repairing.

Swearing like a sailor

Sometimes it’s hard writing for
a newspaper that doesn’t print the
infamous f—bomb.

Imagine having to go through
life without ever using the word
“the.” It’s ‘not easy to get my f——-
ing point across a lot of the time.

    

Melissa Meinzer
Opinions Editor

I remember being in first grade
and realizing that I wouldn’t get
struck by lightening if I said
“dammit” when I stubbed my toe. I
love to swear. I consider it an art
form.

I resolve to continue swearing
far too much in 2004.

Being unapologetically vegan

It is unacceptable to use animals
to meet human needs, living as we
are privileged enough to live in a
society where it’s
almost impossible not to
be adequately nour-
ished.

Nobody likes to hear
that kind of crap! It’s
not nice to tell people
that you think they com-
mit , horrible crimes
every single day, so I’ll
just keep my mouth
shut.

Except when there is
peanut chili-lime tofu
around.

General obnoxiousness

I talk too loudly. Especially on
long bus rides. I’m sort of annoying
if you don’t know me, and probably
really annoying if you do.

I recall a few years ago, my sis-
ter and I sitting in the back of the
North Oakland shuttle, discussing
the intricacies of chicken lovemak-
ing loudly enough that we were get-
ting looks from the front of the bus.
We thought it was funny.

Forgetting to take out the trash
If you were to root around in my
freezer right now, you’d gag. That’s

From the wire: observing gender bias in Video games

By Valerie Sherman V
The Daily Vidette (Illinois State U.)

(U-WIRE) NORMAL, Ill. — Video
games are the devil.

No. Wait. They’re' not the devil,
but they are extremely gender biased,
which is almost as bad.

Most things in mainstream soci-
ety are based on gender.

A class I took last semester made
me consider gender in ways I never
had before, and while watching my
friends play video games, I had an
epiphany.

Video games have always been
geared toward specific audiences,
many times according to gender, and
have become more so as the years
have passed.

Think about how video games
evolved from the early days. Atari
presents the least gender bias of most
game systems. How gender-biased

was “Pong?” No pink or blue paddles;

there. .. «- ~
Then the video game world
moved on to the Nintendo

Entertainment System, with a leap in
graphics technology and an increase
in gender’s presence in the games.

As an example, I will mention the
types of games I possess in my dusty
pile of cartridges. My parents adhered
to the gender bias with the games
they bought. No “Double Dragon” for
me.

If you can believe it, Nintendo

actually made “The Little Mermaid”
into a game. That’s in my pile.
Because I was used to games like
this, “Contra” scared the living crap
out of me at my cousin’s house one
Christmas. Aliens?? Ahhh!
Unfortunately, as entertainment
systems have become more complex
and more widespread, and as games
have become more specialized, gen-
der bias has become more pervasive.
Now, anything I write fromevhere
on out is based on second-hand
knowledge, as I never played any-
thing more complex than the original
NES. V
I know about these things from
my female roommate and my
boyfriend, who each exemplify spe-
cific gender problems relating to
video games.
My roommate loves to play
games with guns, killing, maiming
and dismembering. The ,f‘Extreme

, Gore!” setting in “Grand Theft ,,Au'to7
” HI” might havebeen made just for

her.

However, when she or other
females play these games, they
become the exception.

When they choose to play video
games geared toward a male audi-
ence, _they are usually ridiculed or
gawked at as if they were some kind
of singing and dancing monkeys.

A year ago, when we lived in
Colby Hall, I came home to see a ran-

dom guy standing in our door, staring:

at her slaughtering opponents in
“Unreal Tournament,” a game where
you kill other players in an online set-
ting.

I asked her if she knew the guy,
and she said she didn’t even know
anyone was watching.

Aside from the guy’s voyeurism
being creepy, it became obvious how
unique myroommate is.

She breaks the rules of video
game playing — the games she loves
happen to be the ones geared toward
male players, so she gets weird looks
when she heads to the video game
section of Target.

Just because violent games are
traditionally marketed toward guys,
she shouldn’t have to feel awkward
pursuing a pastime she enjoys.

My boyfriend definitely adheres
to the male-oriented violent «games,
and he’s lucky — no one bats an eye-
lash when he does so.

However, lately, that situation has
changed.

Those familiar with the “Final
Fantasy” game series know that it’s
typically made up of role-playing
games with mainly male protagonists.

The sequel to “Final Fantasy X”
is a break from that, with three
singing and dancing chicks, tanta-
mount to the “Charlie’s Angels” of
the virtual world. V

I know little or nothing of the pre-
ceding games in the series, but watch-
ing this game disturbs even me, a

proud “Little Mermaid” owner.

It raises questions about how far
these gender roles permeate the video
game industry, and therefore the play-

ers.

We are socialized from birth into
gender stereotypes through play with
G.I. Joes and Barbie dolls, and video
games are no exception to that.

Just as we, as little children, were
forced to pick ‘a gender-specific toy in
our “Happy Meals,” we are expected
to conform to those same norms in
relation to video game playing.

Companies know this, and as the
market expanded they created more
gender-specific games.

,_ Much of the gamer market is
male, and society has become used to
this. . .

However, when a company tries
to make a game geared toward
women, it rufﬂes feathers. ,‘ .

The same people who are used to
blood and guts in other games don’t
want to toil to obtain new dress styles
in “Final Fantasy X-2.”

Maybe the video game market
wants to expand to the “fairer sex” to
gain some cash, but by creating
games aimed toward any one gender
automatically leaves out huge seg-
ments of the population.

So girls, next time you want a

Friday night date, head to the nearest_ ,

video game store and try out some
shoot’-em-up games.
You’re sure to turn heads.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

“Remember, trust the fungus. ”
-John Leguizamo, “Super Mario
Bros. ”

PAGE 7

Man Walks into a Room

Nicole Krauss
Anchor Books

5&1/2

It’s hard to read a book when the
reader’s interest wanes as the story
goes on. In most cases, with these
books, it’s hard to get past page 50
without starting to wonder how many
pages there are in the book.

The 248-paged ‘_‘Man Walks" into a
Room” is that type of book‘.

Samson Greene, a brilliant profes-
sor at Columbia University, is found
in Nevada after being listed as “miss-
ing” for eight days. He had been wan-
dering outside the greater Las Vegas
area, which, as the book certainly
implies, has something to do with the
ending.

The reason- for his wandering was
a benign tumor that occupied a part of
his brain that contains his recent
memories. Thus, he basically forgets
everything past the age of 12 '—
things like his high school years, his
marriage and his job.“ The logic
behind this, according to the book, is
that memories are stored in chrono-
logical order; ergo, because of the
tumor’s presence, he didn’t lose mem-
ories before a V
certain time,
but he can’t

book. ,

Errors aside, though, the plot
isn’t much easier to read. The
forceful melancholy of the tale is
a turnoff, and the story just never
seems to stop. Someof the poet-
ic descriptions are told in short,
choppy sentences, making
descriptions slow and, more
often than not, melodramatic.
This accounts for why the book
sometimes reads like a Harlequin
romance novel.

Most frustrating, though, is
how Samson, who is supposed to
have the mindset of a 12-year-
old, keeps using diction that
doesn’t really sound like sixth-
grade vocabulary — ‘foblivion,”
“mystified,” etc. — which makes
the reader believe that maybe he
didn’t forget everything if he
could retain such a sophisticated
speech, and that maybe he isn’t
in too bad of shape But then he
reverts back to a boyish sort of
attitude. For example,_when he’s _
asked about hisrelationship with
his wife, he wants to shout, ‘7We
did it,” meaning they had inter-
course. A

The organization is ‘probably
the biggest problem, though.

Although this seems out of place,
it can actually fit in the book pretty
well about 20 pages later, after they
have more dialogue — more talk
about the problems between them or
the books he found in his library that
he’s been reading and other details of
the sort thatcan earn the wife's dis-
tress instead of the way the author uti-

lized it. Again, this is just one exam-
ple of this problem that runs through-
out the book.

Although these may seem like
trivialities, the small things make a
story; the plot is just the hollow shell.
But even with the plot —— as novel an

idea as the plot may be —- this book is

still sub par.

Story of the Year tells

screaming tales at Laga

Riding on the wave of the
Screamo craze" — think emo—punk
with lots of crazy screaming —
Story of the Year has risen to the
Top 20 in Billboard’s Modern Rock
chart with their breakout single
“Until the Day I Die.” They have
also had a successful run on MTV,
MTV2 and Fuse. You can’t go
through any alternative magazine or
music Web site without seeing their
faces plastered everywhere as the
new “it” band. V 7

Straight out of St. Louis, these
five young, hardcore rockers -
Dan Marsals on vocals, Ryan
Phillips on guitar, Adam Russel on
bass, Josh Will on drums and Phil
Sneed on guitar — gained their own
fan base with their explosive live
shows and fun, heartfelt lyrics and
melodies. Veterans of the Warped
Tour, these guys learned how to
rock from «the best of the best and
gained most of their newfound
exposure and fan base from rocking

the side stage. They have held their

own against some of the best that

rock and punk have to offer.
Their first full—length album —
they have had four independent EPs

— Page Avenue from major label’
“Maverick Records was released on

September 16 and has been blowing
up onto the emo—punk scene. With

its continued success, they are gain— ,

ing a name for themselves in a
genre that seems to be mass—pro-
ducing bands left and right. What
keeps them apart from all the rest is
their razor sharp lyrics and stage
presence that keeps their fans com-
ing, screaming their songs right
back at them.

This Thursday at Club Iiaga, Story
of the Year will be showing off what
makes them the center of attention.
Opening for them is the. local punk

Recommended if you like:
Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys

Once a part of the critically
acclaimed but short—lived group
Grove Theory, standout Amel
Larrieux has set out on a career of
her own. She left the group because
she didn’t like the direction that they
wereheaded and went on a short tour
with Sweetback, Sade’s backup band.
Discovering her talents and potential,
she broke out on her own and caught
the attention of critics-and fans alike
with her first effort, Infinite
Possibilities. 1 Her second album,
Bravebird, is a continuation of her
smooth combination of folk, R&B
and hip-hop. She has the soulfulness
of Erykah Badu, octaves in competi-
tion with Mariah Carey and the beats
of The Roots.

On her sophomore effort, she
oozes with emotion and soul. What is
most unique about her sound is that
every track is so different. Each one
“adds a different perspective to '-the
album as a whole, musically.

A standout track on Bravebird is
the acoustic version of the single-
worthy “For Real.” She demonstrates
her breathtaking vocals and range by
losing the music and letting her voice
take charge. The title track has a light
and almost disco—pop beat backing
up her soulful vocals to create a track
that stands on its own against any
other sort of genre. The songs “Dear
to Me” and “Giving Something Up”
add a hip-hop ﬂavor to the mix.

Amel Larrieux maintains a posi-
tive message through both her music
and her image. Her concentration on
love of the family and inner strength
is refreshing in an industry of dimin-
ishing morals. The most important

_thing in Larrieux’s life is her~family.

She even co-wrote and co-produced

the whole album with her husband

Slowly, critics and even the
awards academies are beginning to
take notice of her talent. Her work
with Stanley Clark has led to a

iGrammy Nomination this year for

their track “Where is the Love” in the
Best R&B Performance by a Duo or

Amel Larrieux’s potential can
push her in the successful footsteps
of Alicia Keys. But with her determi-
nation and talent, she will soon start
on her own path.

I’m not going to go too far into the
plot, mostly because I was laughing
too hard while playing to remember
most of it. That being said, the graph-
ics and music are beautifully presented
and are on par with the latest, greatest
games of the 16-bit era. This may pre-
sent cases of sibling rivalry. ,

One of the most‘ fascinating’ ele-
ments of this game is the ‘control
scheme, which puts you in charge of
both Mario and Luigi — and all of

their ﬁreball-throwing, mallet-pound-
ing, enemy-stomping antics —— at the
same time. Further, the battle system,
in an interesting deviation from most
RPGS, allows players to dodge almost
every attack ﬂung at them. This

requires excellent timing, along with a‘

few minutes of simple trial and error.
However, it will help the player out
immensely in the long run. -

best role-playing games in the history
of the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System. He surpassed his brethren in
almost every respect,’from a well-con-
ceived and often witty plot to an
advanced battle system to graphics
that made his fans drool sweet saliva
from happiness.

However, all was not well in the
household, as his parents broke up
over an argument about whether the
new console should be cartridge- or
CD—based. Squaresoft continued pro-
ducing excellent Role Playing Games,
securing itself as one of the heavy—hit-
ters in Sony’s third-party lineup.
Meanwhile, Nintendo was left trying
to compensate for the loss. Several
years later, “Paper Mario” tried to one-
up — no pun intended —— his older
brother, only to fall into obscurity as
the Nintendo 64 reached its ﬁnal days.

This bittersweet tale of love and
loss has been mended to a point, as
Square Enix has returned to publishing
games for Nintendo consoles, but little
do they realize the wrath of a jilted
lover...

“Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga”
was born last year, and already has
risen to the upper echelons of the

Borrowing heavily from Paper Mario
and Super Mario RPG, it blends past

The “Solution” to Pittsburgh’s Electronic Dance woes lies in the Chemistry  

It has been a long time coming for Electronic Dance
Music (EDM) fans. Finally, there’s a club night that
showcases internationally known talent such as D]
Ruckus, Annalyze and DJ Smalls, while also featuring the
amazing Digital Goodtime resident DJ s. Club Chemistry
in the Strip District has found a “Solution” to the non-

Digital Goodtime Productions, “Solution” is a new
Thursday night party located only at Chemistry.

Here is some background:

Adam X,Ialong with brother Frankie Bones, started
Rave culture in America in the late ‘80s. ‘

There has not ‘been a large-scale EDM night in
Pittsburgh in months. Club Laga used to have Groove, but
drinks were too expensive and the place was too dirty.

Enter Solution. Solution brings back the qualities that
Adam X and Frankie Bones worked to create, like an
awesome environment that is fim for everyone. And ftm
“Solution” will be; With an array of music such as break
beats, house, drum-and-bass, techno" _and the occasional
tumtablism, paired with drink specials all night and beau-

If it takes more than world class, talented DJ ’s to
bring you to “Solution,” consider these special promo-
tions. Between 8 and 9 p.m., the ﬁrst 25 girls will receive
free body jewelry from Ultraﬂash Boutique. There will
also be a model search for an Ultraﬂash commercial to be
aired on MTV. Perhaps even more appealing are the drink
specials that go on all night. The specials are $2 domestic
and well drinks and $3 imports. C .

TheNo. 13 Panthers’ play on ‘the offensive

boards down the stretch allowed themto squeak
past the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 74-71 before

a sellout crowd at the“Petersen Events Center last

night. Q , '_

Pitt trailed for a considerable amount of the
game, but Pitt guard Carl Krauser hit a three-
pointer with seven minutes, 25 seconds left in
the game, and the Panthers never were behind
again.

In the closing minutes of the game, Pitt was
sent to the free throw line on a number of occa-
sions. The Panthers attempted 13 foul shots dur-
ing the final six minutes of the game and only
knocked down eight of them, but they were able
to come up with the rebound on several of their
misses. 7 ,

With three minutes remaining in
Pitt’s basketball game against Notre

a give-and-go with J aron Brown by hit-
ting a driving layup in the lane.

The basket completed a 12-2 run
and gave the Panthers their largest lead
at 63-54. Pitt seemed to be in control
and well on its way to its 17th win of
the season.

But Notre Dame guards Chris
Thomas and Chris Quinn had other
plans.‘ The two Fighting Irish guards
made two three-pointers sandwiched
around a basket by Carl Krauser to cut
Pitt’s lead to two points with two min-
utes left.

Brown, who led Pitt with 19 hard-
eamed points, hit a turnaround runner
in the lane to put Pitt back up by seven,
but Thomas nailed another three to cut
the lead down to four at 67-63.

After receiving the inbounds pass,
Krauser’s pass attempt bounced off
Page’s toe and rolled right to Quinn,
who dribbled the ball twice before sink-

and extended his arm in front of
Thomas’ face, forcing the guard to try
to pass the ball before coming back to
the ground.

“I knew he was going to jump,”
Thomas said of Taft. “I had no success

‘ JACKIE HOTECK
Staff Writer

Competing against Big East rival ‘West Virginia, the
No. 17 men’s swirmning and diving team, along with
the women’s team, dominated the meet, defeating the
Mountaineers 167.5-75.5. In victory, the men’s team
shattered the WVU pool record for the 400-meter med-
ley relay.

Pitt Men 167.5 W V U 75.5
With this win, Pitt remained undefeated in Big East

competition and improved its overall record to 5-1. The
400—meter medley relay was a sign of things to come for

the Panthers as Eric Bugby, Steve Marcucio, Jason

Miller and Stephen Kilroy clocked in at
3:25.84. The relay team broke the pool’s

swimmer tied the Panthers’ Tommy Bird with a time of
47.14 seconds. Pitt came back with a 1-2-3 ﬁnish in the
200-meter backstroke led by Jeff Leath.

Panther diving added 32 points to the Pitt victory
with the top three scores on the 1- and 3—meter boards.

Pitt is back in action at Trees Pool on Jan. 16-17
with a meet against Maryland, Notre Dame and
Villanova.

Pitt Women 164, WVU 72
The women’s swimming and diving team (5-1, 2-1
in the Big East) joined the men’s team in defeat of W V U

’with a score of 164-72.

Pitt defeated the Mountaineers in 11 of 13 events,
dominating in relays. The 400-meter medley relay

proved again to be a strong event for Pitt as Andrea
Shoust, Avy Mitchell, Amy Miteff and Kristin Brown
combined to claim ﬁrst place by ﬁnishing more than
two seconds ahead of the other relay teams.

Carolyne Savini competed in the 1000-meter
freestyle for the first time in three years and won with a
time of 10:33.42. Savini’s win was followed by a Victo-
ry from Jenny Livingstone in the 200-meter freestyle
giving the Panthers a three event-advantage.

WVU didn’t give up and placed 1-2 in the 50-meter
freestyle, but the Win was countered by Panther efforts
as they ﬁnished 1-2-3 in the 200-meter IM.

The Panthers barely claimed first place in
the 200-meter freestyle as Eric

Ken Shelhorse and Marcucio combined
for a 1-2 ﬁnish in the 200-meter llVI.

Performance on boards
seals game forPanthers

Victory, page 11

lowing his missed free throw on the
final attempt. As Page secured the
rebound, he was fouled again and
made one of two shots at the chari-
ty stripe. T ‘ A

The Panthers finished the gam
with center Chris Taft and Troutman
nailing all of their foul shots
respectively; while ‘Brown knocked
down one of two free throws.

“Our guys always seem to hit
free throws when we need it,”
Dixon said. _

At the end of the first half, Pitt
trailed the Fighting Irish in the
rebound category and on the score-
board. It was down 31-30- and had
been out played on the boards 24-
17, despite being even at eight with
Notre Dame on the offensive
boards.

“I thought that we deserved to
win,” Thomas said. “[But] by no
means is this a moral victory,”

The two squads finished the

game deadlocked at 36 total,

rebounds, but Pitt won the battle on
the offensive glass with 10 offen-
sive boards for a total of 18
rebounds on offense compared to
the Fighting .Irish’s 15.

Pitt opened the game on a 6-2
run as Troutman and Taft gave it an
early 4-0 lead on two buckets in the
paint. Notre Dame followed with a
5-l_ run of its own. This tied the
game at seven with a three-pointer
from Thomas and 'a basket from
Torrian Jones.

After Pitt regained the lead,
Jones again knotted the game, this
time at 12, with a basket. Thomas
followed with a score and the
Fighting Irish proceeded to go on a
14-5 run, which gave them a 24-17
lead. The Panthers closed the gap
with an 8-2 run of their own which
broughtthem to within one at the
half. ' _

‘ “We always find a way to Win,”
Krauser said. “I guess we wanted it
more.”

fault, I shouldn’t have gotten in the 

Thomas attempted to throw the ball to his left, to
center Tom Timmermans, but the off-balance pass
went right to Brown. After getting fouled, Brown
made one of two free throws to end the Irish threat.

“We deserved the game,” said Thomas after-
wards. “This is a tough crowd [to play in front of] and
we took their best shot. With 30 seconds left, I thought
we were going to pull it out.”

Notre Dame almost did, thanks to what had been
the Panthers’ Achilles’ heel all of last season —— free
throw shooting.

“They rebound free throws well, but that’s
because they don’t make them,” Notre Dame head
coach Mike Brey said. “It’s deﬂating [to not get the
rebound on a free throw], especially on the front end
of a one-and-one.”

While Pitt’s free throw shooting hovers above 63 _

percent for the year, the Panthers made just half of
their shots from the charity stripe against Notre Dame.
But as Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon pointed out, his

team knows how to win.
“Our guys always seem to hit free throws when
we need them,” said Dixon, “Everyone talks about

- how physical we are, but our guys are smart and they,‘

know what it takes to win.” _
VV1th its 74-71 win, Pitt extends the longest win-

ning streak in the nation to 17 and also improves its 1
win streak at home to 36, which is tops in the nation.

“We stick together as a team,” said Krauser. “We
listen to Coach and we wanted it more. We always
find a way to win.” . I I

So far this season, he’s right.
