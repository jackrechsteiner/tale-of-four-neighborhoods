Pitt student skips class, goes to Hollywood

ERIK ARROYO
Staff Writer

Walking to her anthropology recitation in September,
Beth Home] was looking for an excuse to miss class. It
was a dreary morning and she probably wou1d’ve nodded
off in class, but she couldn’t think of a suitable excuse for
not attending.

As she passed the William Pitt Union, Home], a
19-year-old freshman from Vandergrift, Pa., saw a ﬂyer
advertising tryouts that day for the game show
“Hollywood Squares.” She had just found her reason to
skip. 1

Little did she know that missing class that day would
eventually land her a spot on the “2002 Hollywood
Squares College Tournament Championship.” The show
aired Monday night on KDKA-TV and carried with it a
grand prize of a $25,000 savings bond and a car.

“All I was looking for was a reason not to go to
class,” she said with a smile, “and the tryout was at the
right time. I ﬁgured, why not?”

Hommel, along with about 50 other students, sat in
the Red Lounge in the Union and took a true and false
quiz that tested their knowledge of current events.
Hommel said some of the questions were very unusual,
for example, “True of False: The wind speed of a sparrow
is ﬁve miles per hour.” After all applicants had submitted
their quizzes, each one was scored and returned with a
note telling them to stay or go. Hommel was told to stay.

The next part of the tryout, which involved only 10
participants, required applicants to sit in a circle and tell

_ something interesting about themselves. Hommel said

that she worked in the anthropology lab and played with
squirrel skulls. They then played a mock game of

Hollywood, Squares and were told that they would be A

notified should they make the final cut.
As she left the tryout, Beth was not optimistic about
her chances of earning a spot on the show. ,

, “I wasn’t hopeful that I was going to make the
show,” she said. “I’m majoring in anthropology and the-
ater, so part of being in theater is to audition for every-
thing. So that’s what I did.”

Almost two months later, while she was shopping on

COURTESY HOLLYWOODSQUARESCOM

“Hollywood Squares” host Tom Bergeron leans on
Pitt student Beth Home] Who was on the’ show.-

her cell phone rang. ’
"This guy said ‘Hi, this is Ed from Hollywood
S,quares,’” she said. “‘You’ve been picked to be a contes-

tant on the show.”’ .

Hommel said’ she didn’t believe the caller until she
received a conﬁrmation letter in the mail. “I was so excit-
ed, I honestly couldn’t believe it. I started running around
giving money to homeless people,” she said.

Hommel became the second consecutive Pitt student
to appear on the game show. Last year, sophomore Kyle
Slaughter participated in the tournament and won $2,400
and a trip to Walt Disney‘World. .

To prepare for the January ﬁlming, Beth had her
mom tape the show every night for the two months until
she left. She would then have a “squares marathon”
where she watched the show for six hours at a time.

On I an. 25, she ﬂew to Los Angeles, where a chauf-

’ feur holding a card with her name on it greeted her. She

met the other contestants, spent the evening with them

and received instructions from the show’s crew on how p

to act surprised and excited the entire time they were on
arr. - —
“They lectured us on how to keepour energy up, but
they didn’t have to lecture me on that,” she said.

On the day of the taping, they arrived at 7 a.m. and
were given a tour of the CBS studio and the stage.
Hommel was impressed with the size of the stage and
said that during the walk-through, she saw a Pitt Panthers
ﬂag in the contestant’s booth. .

“I guess going ﬁrst was best,” she said. “You get it
over with and get the nervousness out.”

Monday night, Hommel and a few ﬁiends gathered ‘

at her North Dithridge apartment to watch the show air.
Her mother made the 45-minute drive into town just for
the special occasion. A sign on the front door read “Beth’s
Hollywood Squares Party, Come on Up,” and red bal-
loons adorned the windows. Just to be safe, Hommel
started recording 10 minutes before the show was set to
start. ~
Hommel kept her earnings top-secret to" everyone,
even her mother, not only as part of her contract but as

the Wednesday before Thanksgiving with her best friend,

. By the end of_the half-hour segment, those at Beth’s
apartment were not only rooting for her, but for the Pitt
advertisements that aired during commercial breaks.
They laughed and applauded one in particular that was an
ad for San Diego State University, the school of Beth’s
opponent, but played Pitt’s Fight Song in the background
of the commercial. - _

Beth won the ﬁrst two rounds before a time shortage
cut the third round short, but she advanced to the 60-sec-’
ond bonus round where she chose Whoopi Goldberg as
her supporter. By the show’s end, Hommel was $11,000
richer and wearing a smile from ear to ear. Her mother’

jumped out of her chair and gave her a bear hug‘ as the ,
closing credits rolled. The phone rang and continued to

do so, the first congratulatory call coming from "her father.

“This was fun,_” she said. “The whole thinggwasfun. _ , ' _

This was a once-in—a-lifetime experience and I enjoyed
every minute of it.” —

Kenpo Karate Club teaches students self-defense

KATE LAUGHLIN ‘
Staff Writer

Pitt’s United Parker’s Kenpo Karate
Club gave new meaning to the phrase
“sticks and stones may break your bones”
at its self-defense seminar Saturday.

The Kenpo Club hosted Gary
Ronemus, an instructor from York, Pa.
who holds a seventh-degree black belt in
Kenpo Karate. Ronemus instructed both
laymen and Kenpo students in basic self-
defense techniques that utilize a 5 1/2 inch
lightweight key chain stick as a weapon.

“It’s important to know how to use
it,” Ronemus said. “Pennsylvania law
dictates that self-defense is limited to the
force necessary to stop the action against
you.”

Legal disclaimers out of the way,
Ronemus proceeded to show how to take

V down attackers by pinpointing nerves to

hit as targets. Rather than tactics involv-
ing brute force, he advised going for sen-

sitive places like the ﬂeshy areas of the.

neck and face, the sensitive area between
the bicep and bone or the standard debili-
tating favorite, the groin.

“Kenpo is a system,” Ronemus said.
“It doesn’t rely on one move but on many
strikes. You don’t necessarily have to
memorize techniques, but develop
instincts so you can react to attackers.”

Freshman Brent Hull thought the
seminar would be a good way to check
out the club.

“This has introduced me to some new
ideas,” he said. “It will take some practice
but I have some ideas on how to defend
myself now.”

In light of recent crimes in Oakland
ranging from kidnapping to break-ins
these skills may be extremely valuable.

Alex Dorsey, graduate student at

Indiana University of Pennsylvania and a
head instructor of Pitt’s Kenpo Club, said
that what distinguishes American Kenpo
Karate from other styles of martial arts is
that it is not geared toward sport or com-
petition but completely toward defending
oneself against attackers. '_ '

“’There’s lots of contact,” he said.
“We hit a lot.” .

But Dorsey warned that a black belt
in Kenpo does not turn a person into
Superman. -

“It just gives you a better than aver-
age chance to beat the average person,” he
said. .

Pitt sophomore Joshua Ryer is the

president and founder of the club, V and

also serves with Dorsey as a head instruc-
tor. The Kenpo they teach is an
Americanized version of karate rooted in
Chinese martial arts and was developed
by Ed Parker, for. whom the club is

named. '

Dorsey‘ described Parker’s style as ‘

traditional karate updated for today’s
environment —.— specifically, for self—.
defense on the street. " ‘ ’
-Ronemus, who trained under Kenpo
founder Ed Parker, stressed that studying
Kenpo is about more than just physical
movements. I - - =
, “It is a system of concepts and princi-
ples of motion,”-_.he said. “Everything you
learn -can be modiﬁed to .ﬁt the situation.

You’re not  to beat’anyone up, just '

cause enough pain or injury to get out of
a situation.” . p ' ~
Membership in the club is free, with
the exception of uniform costs. Members
meet four times a week in Trees Hall, and
new students are always welcome. E-mail

Collapse, page 1

cost less than $300 million, the total cost
is -already more than $370 million. But
according to Leeper, cost and completion
date are secondary concerns now.

“If the accident delays the opening of
the building, that’s the least of our con-
cerns,” he said. “It’s very difficult that we
lost somebody, and when something like
this occurs, you need a proper investiga-
tion before you can proceed with plans.”

The collapse occurred at the 13th of
15 main support columns that run from
north to south, but Leeper and other offi-
cials could not offer a definite cause yes-

terday. High winds, a crane malfunction
or workers hurrying to finish the building
—— a theory suggested by local media and
sternly denied by Leeper—— were all pre-
sented as possible causes.

The West end of the Convention
Center is officially slated to open next
weekend for the Pittsburgh RV Show.
Leeper said that, as of now, the scheduled
event will still take place, with RVs arriv-
ing ‘next Tuesday.

Students, alumni lobby in Harrisburg to fight cuts

grams to fund healthcare last year.
Under Schweiker’s proposed budget,
this money will be funneled back
into the state’s General Fund, along
with a quarter of the $93 million he
is directing toward similar programs
in the new budget. This means Pitt’s
health funding could be lost.

Alex said that he. felt his lobby
ing went “very well.” -

“The majority of people I spoke

with did believe that the 5 percent

decrease to state-related schools in
the governor’s budget was unfair,”
Alex said.

Jennifer Levengood, _a legisla-
tive assistant for State Senator Jay
Costa, D-Penn Hills, explained that
legislative-hearings on the budget
begin Feb. 27 and continue until
March 7. '

“During that time, representa-
tives from Pitt’s administration will
be lobbying the appropriations com-
mittees of the state House and
Senate. The final budget won’t even
be passed until June,” Levengood
said.

Hill said the University couldn’t
specify the exact amount of an
increase at this time.

“We refuse to speculate. We’re

very early in the budget process,”
Hill said. “We hope that most of the
reductions will be restored through
the legislative process.”

But Hill said that some tuition
hike is almost unavoidable. “A
tuition hike would be likely in any
event. It’s only a question of how
much. It’s too early in the process to
predict what that amount would be.”

SGB is in the process of plan-
ning a Harrisburg lobbying trip for
students to further address the prob-
lem.

EDITORIAL  

Students must mobilize now

“It’s only a question of how much.”

That’s the ofﬁcial University line
when it comes to next year’s tuition
increase. .

Facing a proposed 5 percent cut in
state funding, which makes up roughly 15
percent of the University’s revenue, the
University won’t even speculate as to how
much more tuition will be. A Sept. article
in the University Times, a newspaper pub-
lished by the University, stated that tuition

could be raised by more than 4 percent.‘

And that was before Pitt found out that it
would likely receive a cut in funding from
the state. ‘

Following a year when tuition
jumped 7.5 percent — the largest in 13
years — another large increase will be
hard to bear.

There is reasonable concern that
tuition increases of this magnitude will
quickly become exclusionary. A study by
the Lumina Foundation for Education
recently rated Pitt as unaffordable for low-
income dependents. Further increases
could easily exclude more students from
higher education.

Certainly Pitt will offer the standard
line that tuition increases will fund more
scholarships. This is a ridiculous response.
The majority of students won’t beneﬁt
from more funding for scholarships. Pitt
doesn’t, as a general rule, re-evaluate
scholarships for retuming students, mean-
ing that most scholarships help less every

year. Second, the redistribution effect of
charging all students more to give a few
others scholarships is only questionably
logical, not to mention arguably unfair.
Pitt will certainly provide the other
standard reason for increasing tuition:
more money equals higher quality educa-

I tion. While Pitt students certainly get a

good bang for their buck, a higher quality
education does not appear to have a direct
relationship to the increase in tuition. (By
this logic, schools can be ranked solely by
their cost —- the more expensive the
school, the better the school.)

Furthermore, it seems likely Pitt’s low
cost is large factor in attracting increasing-
ly competitive students. Pitt would do well
to keep that in mind when considering
tuition hikes.

Fortunately, any tuition increase
being discussed at this time is merely
speculation. The state budget is far from
being approved and Pitt is far from
approving its budget for next fall.

It is imperative that students mobilize
now. State legislators must hear from the
students. Tell them to make education a
priority in the state of Pennsylvania by
appropriating more funds than the
Govemor’s budget ‘
Furthermore, Pitt’s trustees must start
planning now to keep tuition in check.
Scholarships and small increases in state
and federal ﬁnancial aid will not counter-
balance a signiﬁcant tuition increase.

  Russian skating gold ridiculous

I was sitting on a dirty couch at a
Carnegie Mellon fraternity house, watch-
ing the Olympics and crying. Although this
outpouring of emotion is not rare for me,
my tears were not tears of joy, but tears of
sadness.

On Monday night, the.

the most ﬁrst place votes gets the gold
medal, regardless of what the marks were.

In Monday’s event, using the marks
for technical merit and presentation alone,
Sale and Pelletier won by .05 points. But
when the ranks appeared on the screen, the
Russians received ﬁve ﬁrst

Russian and Canadian ﬁgure
skating pairs faced 0H for the
gold medal and instead of
being a night where the best
pair won, it turned into a night

heartbreak.

everybody. So when Sikharulidze failed to
land a jump, I felt bad for them because the
gold was now out of reach. Or so I thought.
Canadian pair Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier came on the ice next and skatedla
perfect performance. After they were done,
everyone watching — the armouncers, the
crowd and even I — couldn’t help but be
on their side. They were a young and heart-
felt couple and had just skated to gold...
But not if the judges had anything to
say about it. ‘
The nine judges decided that a team
that made more mistakes and a country
that won the gold medal in this event in the
last 10 Winter Olympics should win
instead. .
How could this happen? I _
In the sport, judges give each pair a
mark between zero and 6.0 for both tech-
nical merit —— execution of elements such
as jumps and throws -—- and for presenta-
tion — choreography. Then they rank the
pair, in this case, either in ﬁrst or second
place, based on their own feelings about
where the pair should place. The pair with

Suspiciously, a Detroit
Free Press anicle about the 1998 games in
Nagano, Japan, noted that Sikharulidze
and Berezhnaya received a controversial

‘medal in those games as well. They fell -

twice during their program and, according
to commentator Sandra Bezic, “weren’t on
that particular night, but were given a gift
because of their talent.” '

Well, they got their gift in Nagano and

didn’t deserve another one in Salt Lake _

City.’ Mistakes aremistakes — if a judge
doesn’t use them as determining factors in
givingout the most sought—after medals in
the world, then what else can we assume
but conspiracy?

Suspicion of judge collaboration and
bias has been thrown around for years.
There have been several suggestions to
change the ' scoring system, including a
simple plan, to make the judges anony-
mous and not outwardly aﬂiliated with a
speciﬁc country.

ISO: Yourself or someone like you

We want to see ourselves in the media.
This need goes beyond the narcissistic thrill
and embarrassment of being on camera. We
go to movies or ﬂip through glossy maga-
zine pages and ﬁnd someone who looks like,
thinks like and acts like we do.

three beauty types portrayed in the movie:
dark hair, light skin; light hair, light skin; and
rugged, unshaven manly man, epitomized
by Aragorn who last took a bath sometime in
the fourth century. I laughed her criticism

overly sensitive and should
simply let the movie tell a fan-
tastical and entertaining story.
Then I made the fortunate
mistake of picking up a
Seventeen magazine. On the

installment of the “Lord of the tions

enthusiast and an all-around out-of-theclos-
et geek, I enjoyed the ﬁlm for its numerous
bloody ﬁghts, explosive chase scenes and
the way Elijah Wood’s eyes increased expo-
nentially in area throughout the movie. I
readily agreed with The Washington City
Paper reviewer who called Legolas, an
archer elf-warrior, “the prettiest thing in
pointed ears.” ‘

After I saw the movie and a friend
pointed out a ﬂaw in it, I ignored her. She
said, accurately enough, that there were only

Iread the article. Ireadit again. Ilooked
between lines, into innuendos and through
the impenetrable bog of young love ﬂopping
on the rocks. Something was missing, I
knew that much, but what?

Like a lighting bolt on a nine-iron in the
middle of the PGA tour, it hit me. Not one
question out of 10 dealt with relevant topics
such as interracial dating, interreligious con-
ﬂict or amorphous sexuality. Gay and bisex-
ual girls couldn’t read this magazine and ﬁnd
themselves in it anywhere. Nor could any-
one dating outside her ethnic, , socio-eco-

nomic or religious groups. Life is enough of
a struggle at age without magazines not only
pointing out that questioning one’s sexual
orientation is anomalous or one’s skin too
dark to be the norm, but also ignoring that
such people exist at all.

The media offers only half-hearted solu- '

tions to this gigantic problem. For instance,
tokenism — the miserable institution of
making one character gay, black, Muslim or
some other minority in order to make up for
the lack of diversity otherwise '—- offers only
condescension. As it pains me to see the
media packed with cardboard characters, it
causes full-out facial tics to see actors play
nothing more t_han caricatures of a particular
race, religion or sexual orientation.

Stupidity continues its reign over the
airwaves. There are many minor slights that
we leam to shrug off and blame on bad writ-
ing and acting. For instance, that the true hor-
ror story in most slasher ﬂicks is that the
black guy bites it ﬁrst, his last words usually
some bangin’ street slang, followed by the
dopey-looking fat guy and the chick who
dared to have sex. i '

This being said, take a 17-year hike in
my friend’s shoes. Imagine her alienation at
turningon the television or opening a People
and ﬁnding nothing with which to identify.

Imagine her being presented with a physical

ideal so unattainable that it cannot be irnitat—
ed without her undergoing massive amounts
of plastic surgery. Imagine her seeing
“Friends” with Ross, Rachel and their
minority-less New York and not being able
to say, “I get that,” “I act like that” or “I can
understand what they are going through.”
Imagine not being able to sympathize or
empathize with the majority of social icons.
Imagine the distance this creates, the intense
feelings of disappointment and isolation.

Now try watching a movie.

“Lord of the Rings” represented fantasy
in the truest sense. It reﬂected nothing of the
Crayola box of colors that ﬁlls the world.‘
And anyone with the slightest tan would say
that the ﬂesh-tone crayon isn’t exactly talk-
ing about his or her particular ﬂesh.

I have not called my slighted friend and
apologized for this injury. I haven’t cancelled
my subscription to Rolling Stone or stopped
seeing movies opening day. But now I see

i the world anew, with an open mind and an

eye unafraid to see the truth in the ﬂickering
images.

Enter the despicable duo, Margaret and Melissa.

The car screamed its grandfatherly origins; it was
a 1983 Ford Fairmount Futura, powder blue with
bench seats. It could seat six comfortably. The interi-
or was impeccable. It had a sticker on the bumperthat
read, “I’d rather be taking the train.”

VV1thin a -few months, that car evolved into a
straight-up party on wheels. First came the huge

the bumper down the middle. I think 01’ Blue was the
only car ever to advocate killing meat eaters on the
_same bumper that proclaimed “Save a Tree; Eat a
Beaver.” -

Toward the end of her life, Ol’ Blue became a
shadow of her rnid-eighties glory. She’d fret up hills
and usually stall out at stop signs and red lights.

on a scent of smoke, sweat, puke and root beer.

Once, my sister lockedthe keys in the car. Luckily, she was
hanging out with a chivalrous gentleman known only as Drunk
Paul who came to her rescue by bashing out the back triangular
window. That came in handy a few months later when the heat
quit.
Working at a small grocery store, I obtained all kinds of pro-
motional gimmick items, like a giant mug shaped like that Slim
Jim guy’s head. J im became the front seat ashtray, lashed to the car-
pet with duct tape. When I ran through a fence, Jim didn’t spill a
single ash.

My sister decided the car was clearly female and christened
her “Ol’ Blue.” I decided a purple furry steering wheel cover was
in order, along with glittery blue dice for the mirror. Margaret was
not exactly happy about this, but she dealt with it. The real contro-
versy came when we decided we needed bumper stickers.

First I added a Grateful Dead sticker to the back window. So
far, so good. Next came one of those little Darwin ﬁsh with the feet.

Our family mechanic was sympathetic; he’_d always do what

When she was due -for her last inspection, we dropped her off
at the mechanic’s and left for a weeklong family vacation, fully
expecting to pick her up afterward, legal as can be. When we came
home, my sister and father went to pick her up. i

During the course of the week, the mechanic decided there
wasn’t enough money in the world to make Ol"B1ue roadworthy.
Margaret and Dad drove her to the junkyard, took out all the fuzzy
nonsense and never looked back.

In this jilted modern world, real love
songs are few and far between. Oh, sure,
there are plenty of songs about love, but
rarely are they happy songs or songs that
affirm our faith in love. It’s hard to make
a mix tape for your signiﬁcant other
without resorting to either not—quite love
songs or really crappy music. ‘

.But never fear! The Pitt News is here I

to show you the ways of love. Maybe
you haven’t heard all of the tensongs that
are about to follow, but they’re almost
guaranteed to make anyone swoon. I’m
leaving it up to you to pick yourfavorite

A oldies to add.

Track 1: Bright Eyes, “Kathy-With‘ a
K’s Song” V p 1 A ;
Sample lyric: Love is real / It is not just in
long distance cornrnercials / or some-
thing that you thought you felt back in
highschool. , ' ' ‘ j *

There is no more intense way to start a
love song mix CD than with Bright Eyes.
The intense howl of “Love is real” is a
perfect way to kick off the whole she-
bang. I .

Track 2: R.E.M., «At My Most
Beau‘ ”

Sample lyric: I read bad poetry / into your ‘

machine. / I save your messages / just to
hear your voice. ,

This gorgeous song is a real Crowd-pleas-
er. Who can honestly say they don’t like
asingle R.E.M. song?

Track 3: Quasi, “It’s Hard to Turn Me
On”

Sample lyric: You turn me on and it’s
hard to turn me on / MomingsVI teH you
what I dreamed before we’re swallowed
by the work machine.

OK, so this song is not the happiestsong
in the world, especially with all of its talk
about what a miserable world it is. But he
point is that despite how ' much every-
thing can suck, the singer enjoys the

company of his lover. That’s pretty

Track 4: Ani DiFranco, “Whatalli is
Nice” . V .
Sample lyric: Today we are only whatall
is nice about us. / Today we tumed_ on in
the blue light of dawn and made love.

It took her aV couple of years, but Ani
DiFranco ﬁnally decided to write a love
song —— and what a love song it is.

Track 5: Blur, “Coffee and TV”

How to he a secret admirer    

There are few" things“less_ romantic _

this Valentine’s Day then paying oﬂ° your
fellow cellmates in return for your chasti-
ty. But in today’s world of hyper-_suspi-

cions and. paseless accusations, one

wrong step could land you a_ day job in
Allegheny County jail. The fact is, when
treading through the muck of millennial
courtship, it is easier to screw up than not.

Yet thewill of a romantic is a" ﬂame
not easily quenched by the cold and hard-
ened world. of legalese. So the real ques-
tion for all the Romeos out there is how to
plan a romantic escapade into the world

V of secret romance without a defense attor-
ney and a court order requiring you to
' remain 200 yards away from your J uliet, V

The line between stalker and admirer
is one based almost entirely on percep-

V‘ tion. If the object of -your affection has

been waiting for you to make the move,
chances are he or she will let some of the
creepier elements of cloak-and-dagger

ﬂirtation slide; If, on the other hand, you V

plan to go after someone who wrote his or
her senior thesis on the advantages of par-
tial-birth abortion using you as the prime

example. . .you might want to play it safe. ‘
-Therefore, always, always, always V

keep your goal in mind. A secret admirer
doesn’t want to stay secret forever. The
ideal ending is the one where the two of

you are sitting on a hill in the cool rays of , ‘
f a late auturrm sunset and. .~.you get the V

' ,idea.Asecret admirer who leaves no way" ,

of being found is a threatening, not VV

romantic, entity. A
At the other extreme _though, is the

secret admirer who is far too obvious (“a

  

certain blonde haired, green eyed,.twen-

" tysomething with a cheap apartment and

a dead end job likes ‘you. XOXO!!!!!”).
Always leave a trace, but judge the

' extremity of it. Gradually build yourclues I
-from, intriguing, just—on—the-_tip-of—my-

tongue details, to the out-and-out-explicit
(‘.‘It’s me, dangnit”) For instance, when

' you write a letter to your sweetie, add a

phrase thatheor she can repeat back to
you for easy recognition at a first meeting.

Remember to keep the game easygo-
ing. The secret admirer dynamic should
remain amusing for everyone involved.
You can draw little hearts on your cards,
but not in your own blood. Be very care-
ful in the words you use. There is a dif-

. ference between “l’ve been gazing at you

from afar”V and “.I’ve been watching you
for some time now.” And remember, if
you’re trying to decide whether to keep
your headlights on when you follow that
certain someonedown a South Oakland

alley, you’ve probably taken it too far.

The reason? “Creepy” is the key

word in all _of this. Before every move .

you make, askyourselfthis: “Is what I ’m
about to do something that Va) the
Unabomber would ~ do, b) Hannibal

Lecter would do, c) Scott Tyree would do

or d)‘Pepe LePew would do?” If you
answered “yes," to any of the above, go
ahead -and turn yourself in to the local
authoritiesj . _ V i ,
Otherwise, paint your body pink and
go crazy. You’re ready for Valentine’s

~ Day.

Planning on staying in this
Valentine’s Day? Do you have some-
one to spend i.t with, and you just want
to watch a mushy movie? Maybe you
don’t have anyone to spend it with.

Either way, romantic comedies are ~

21 great way to spend a couple of hours,
and if you’re lucky, you might even be
able to avoid a trip to the video store if
you can ﬁnd them on television. Now
that’s a cheap date.

  1) “Clueless” (1995)

Based on J ane.Austen’s novel “Emma,”

’ “Clueless”- is one of the best ﬁlm adap-

tations to date. “Clueless” changed the

how this movie ﬂows. It’s funny, it’s

1) “American Psycho” (2000)

It’s February and your girlfriend just

psycho) would do and rent a movie.

2) “Enter the Dragon” (1973)

Bruce Lee and two hours of butt kicking
could get anyone’s mind off of
Valentine’s Day.

3) The best of Jenna Jameson (1994-

Hey, it’s cheaper than paying a stripper.
As Woody Allen once said, “Its not
masturbating, it’s making love to your-
self.”

4) “Basic Instinct” (1992)
It’s classic aversion therapy. Before, you
couldn’t stop thinking of that femme

fatale in your psychology class, but now

all you see is a long, sharp ice pick.

5) “Killer Klowns from Outer Space”
(1988)

Killer clowns. . .valentines. . . get it‘? OK,

back from Friday’s defeat against Lock

Lininger fought_ back. Testa proved to
be too much, as Lininger eventually lost

KEITH PARADISE
The Pitt News

As the Pitt gymnastics team -{was ﬁnishing their
ﬂoor routines, the gymnasts from the Rutgers Scarlet
Knights, having already ﬁnished their performance on

\ the balance beam, crowded in a comer and watched.

After Pitt gymnast Heather Launse had ﬁnished her
routine, many of them applauded.-
They weren’t the only ones who were impressed.

The Panthers tied or topped their season highs in all ‘

four routines as they posted a season best total score of

' 194.35 and ﬁnished ﬁrst at the Pitt Invitational Saturday

night at Trees Hall. Rutgers ﬁnished in second place
-with a total of 192.12, and James Madison ﬁnished in

V third with a score of 189.15. Wilson College placed

fourth with a score of 160.75.

Pitt’s Diandra O’Connor turned in her ﬁnest perfor-
mance of the season as she ﬁnished in ﬁrst place for all-
around points with a score of 39.00, a career best. On the
uneven parallel bars, O’Connor swung her way into a
career high score of 9.8, over three points higher than
her previous best of 9.475 and good enough for second

place overall in the event. Pitt’s Raya Mullin ﬁnished in
ﬁrst place with a score of 9.825.

The Panthers also received -a solid performance
from Nathalie Sulpher. On vault, Sulpher was the ﬁnal
Pitt gymanst to perform and made the saying “saving
the best for last” true. Sulpher scored a 9.85 on her vault
routine, a career best that earned her a first place ﬁnish
at the end of the evening. Pitt’s Alyse Zefﬁro also scored
a career high on vault with a 9.8, landing her in second
place overall. =

Sulpher received her other career high on the
uneven parallel bars where she scored a 9.775, two
points higher than her previous high score, placing
fourth place overall in the event. Mullin ﬁnished in ﬁrst
place on bars with a score of 9.825. Sulpher feels that

the attitude of the team has improved since the begin-

ning of the season.

“I think there is a lot more enthusiasm and that the
girls are a lot more conﬁdent and they are out there to
have ﬁm now,’,’ Sulpher said. “AD the girls are happy.”

Head coach Debbie Yohman is happy with the
results as well. 9‘

, “I have never had a team that, scores wise, got bet-

Gymnastics dominates rivals at Pitt Invitational

ter and better every week,” Yohman said. “Every single
person on my team stood out today.”

The team has struggled at times during the season
on the balance beam routine but showed no signs of it
on Saturday as they posted a season best score of 48.9,
over two points higher than their average.

Lisa Yarosh and Colleen Crisi each turned in career
best scores on the beam, each scoring a 9.8, placing
them in a tie for second for the event. James Madison’s
Janelle Diorio scored a 9.825, landing her in first place.

Ironically, Yohman was not -too pleased her team’s
practice results on the balance beam this week

“We had a mixed bag of results,” Yohman said.
“[The team] didn’t know what the lineup was until we
started beam because I didn’t know who was going to be
ready, but they all were ready.”

The Panthers are now 5-5 on the season and 1-2 in
the EAGL. They will host Central Michigan and
Ursinus Saturday at the Fitzgerald Field House at 7 p.m.

Yohman feels that now that the team has found con- _

ﬁdence, maintaining is key.‘ .
“We’ve got the attitude,” Yohman said, “we just
have to keep it up.” .

Remember the run: Pitt emerges as a team

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Staff Writer

In 1999, Ben Howland inherited a
young team with a losing record and as few
as three players on the bench during the
course of a game. The Panthers went 13-15
in Howland’s ﬁrst season, but they learned to
play as a unit, focusing on playing defense
and grabbing rebounds. Most importantly,
the attitude of the Pitt basketball program
had greatly improved. ’

In 2000, that improved attitude ﬁnally
translated into an improved record.

Pitt started off the
2000 campaign on a
positive note, win-

R5Butterrt.e A

ning its first five pan 2 of 3
gangs of the gga3on_ Howland guides Pitt
into the postseason

Equally important
was the immediate
impact Issac Hawkins made, leading the
Panthers in rebounding in six of their ﬁrst
nine games. Hawkins was redshirted his
junior year due to a stress fracture in his leg
that kept him out for most of the season. His
return gave Pitt an experienced inside pres-
ence that it lacked in 1999.

“I think we seemed tobeabettertearn

than we were the previous year,” Howland
said. “Having Issac back, even though he
hardly got to practice my ﬁrst year because
of the stress fracture, and just having some
depth was great,” Howland said.

After ﬁnishing their nonconference
schedule with an 8-3 record, the Panthers
faced their ﬁrst Big East test at home against
Miami on Jan. 3, and defeated the
Hurricanes 62-51, already improving upon

.their 0-5 Big East start in 1999-2000.

Pitt’s next home game came against
then No. 15-ranked Syracuse. In front of a
national television audience, Ricardo Greer
contributed 23 points and nine rebounds to
give the Panthers a 14-point second half
lead. But the Orangemen applied pressure
with 15 minutes, 20 seconds left in the game,
sparking a 19-6 nm en route to a 71-66
Syracuse victory. ‘

“Losing a game against Syracuse at
home up 15 was probably the toughest loss
we had in the Big East regular season last
year,” Howland said. .

The Inauguration

The ability to bounce back from disap-
pointing defeats was a recurring attitude
adjustment for the 2000 Panthers and a

reﬂection of Howland’s ongoing teaching '

process. Pitt proved this with its next Big
East win, a 77-65 upset at home against the
No. 15-ranked Seton Hall Pirates. The win
was Pitt’s ﬁrst over’ a top 25 opponent since
Jan. 30, 1999, and proved that the Panthers
had the ability to compete with any team in
the conference. ‘

As Jan. 16 rolled around, thousands of
Americans ﬂocked to Washington to witness
a controversial presidential inauguration. On
the other side of town, Pitt traveled to
Georgetown to face the 16-0, No. 9-ranked

 
  
 
  
  
 

Hoyas. And while many protested the inau-
guration under a national media glare, the
upstart Panthers celebrated what would turn
out to be their biggest win of the regular sea-
son. .
The Panthers shocked the Hoyas with a
70-66 victory, moving to 11-6 overall and 3-
3 in the Big East Conference.

“It was a huge win because it gave us
some momentum,” Howland said.

The Georgetown victory also thrust Pitt
freshman Julius Page into the national spot-
light. Pageled the Panthers with 18 points
against Georgetown and simultaneously

provided the college basketball
-world with one of the most mem-
orable plays of the season.
Early in the ﬁrst half, Pitt trailed
by ﬁve when the 6-foot-3-inch
Page drove the lane and dunked
over 7-foot center Reuben Boumtje-
Boumtje, sparking a 12-2 nm for the
Panthers and making highlight reels
throughout the country. -

As a freshman, Page proved to be
instrumental to the Panthers’
throughout the season. Page started 25
games for the Panthers in his ﬁrst year, aver-
aging 9.1 points per game. In addition, he
took on the responsibility of guarding some
of the best guards in the country on a week-
ly basis, and posted a .341 three-point per-
centage. A . . .

“Julius is a great shooter,” Howland

said. “He was put into a main role right ’

away, which is diﬂicult for a freshman. He
had a pretty good year, and he helped us ﬁn-
ish really strong.’_’ ' .

Pitt won its season ﬁnale against
Virginia Tech 7051 in front of ‘a packed
Fitzgerald Field House crowd. The Panthers
stood at 15-12 overall, but ﬁnished in ﬁfth
place in the Big East West with a 7-9 confer-
ence record. Many predicted that Pitt would
go out early in the Big East Tournament and
be a bubble team for the postseason National
Invitational Tournament.

And then came “The Run.”

The Run

Pitt headed to Madison Square Garden
for the Big East Tournament with a No. 5
seed in the West, and they faced the fourth-
seeded Miami Hurricanes in the ﬁrst round
of the tournament. Pitt defeated the
Hurricanes 78-69, earning its second victory
of the season over the Hurricanes and its ﬁrst
Big East Tournament victory in three years.

The Panthers’ next opponent proved to
be far more formidable. The N otre Dame
Fighting Irish had ﬁnished atop the Big East
West standings. Not only were the Irish com-
ing off of a bye, but they had swept Pitt dur-
ing the regular season and boasted one of the
top players in the country, All-American

v Troy Murphy. But the Panthers pulled off

one of the biggest upsets in Big East
Tournament history, beating the Irish 66-54
with 17 points by Greer.

“The Run” continued, as the Panthers
defeated the heavily favored Syracuse

success _

' GREG UESTER /THE P177 News .

Julius Page played a key. role as a freshman, averaging 9.1 points per game
while making highlights with his dunk over 7-foot Reuben Boumtje-Boumtje.‘

Orangemen with a 55-54 overtime victory.
VV1th that win, Pitt advanced to itsﬁrst Big
East Championship game in school history.‘
In less than a week, the Panthers had va11lted
from being an NIT‘ hopeful to being on the
brink of the NCAA Tournament. I

Unfortrmately, the No. 9 Boston
College Eagles proved to be too much for
the Panthers, and their Cinderella run came
to an end with a 79-57 defeat in the Big East
Championship. But the unexpected drive to
the title game proved to be a good learning
experience for Howland and the Panthers.

“ [The Big East Tournament] was really

fun, and I think our guys really came togeth-
er,” Howland said. ‘They did a good job of
buying into my system and it all came
together. We really shut people down on the
defensive end of the ﬂoor and that’s where
you win.” ' — ' . '
Pitt received an invitation to play in the NlT,_
their ﬁrst in four years, and it hosted a ﬁrst-'
round game against the ‘Bonnies of St.
Bonaventure. Pitt weathered an early St.
Bonaventure storm to defeat the Bonnies 85-
74, and for the ﬁrst time in four years,
Pittsburgh was infected with March
Madness. '

On March 19, the Panthers hosted A

Mississippi State in a second round NIT‘
game. The Panthers grabbed a 27-13 lead
early on and looked to roll over the Bulldogs.
 931116 .baCl§ to tie the

{tint

score "at halftime, and with just over a minute
left, the Bulldogs hit two consecutive three-
pointers to win the game 66-61 and end Pitt’s
2000-2001 campaign.

The Aﬁermath

The Panthers went 19-14 in their second
season under Howland, and several factors
contributed to the team’s success. Greer
earned second teamiAll-Big East honors in
his senior season, and Donatas Zavackas
proved valuable as a sophomore starter,
shooting 49 percent from the three-point line
and playing tough defense.

Brandin Knight led the team in-assists
and ﬁnished second in scoring, while Jaron

‘Brown steadily improved as the season pro- _
. gressed, contributing valuable minutes off

the bench.

After two seasons at the helm, Howland
laid the framework for a great program. He
took a losing team and led them to a post-
season-win, and he returned three starters for
2001. ’ —

VV1th the loss of Hawkins, the focus
'tumed to recruiting ’a big man to comple-
ment Pitt’s talented young backcourt. Pitt’s
rallying cry became “Remember the Run,”
but Howland had a run of a different sort in
mind. I

“Really my second year I thought we
were in better shape,” Howland said. “Butit
still wasn’t completely turned over.”

Indoor track, Rocks excel in meet at Penn State

“Fourteen more people need to .

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Penn State’s track facility draws
competitors from all over the coun-
try, near and far. With the times run
on the track this weekend at the
United States Track Coaches
Association Challenge Cup, it’s no
wonder why. /

"‘Out of all the meets going on
around the country, Penn State was
the best meet,” head coach Steve
Lewis said, “pound for pound in
every event.”

The Penn State track always

 

         Everybody  1

Tm: pas-i~ News

seems to bring out the best in Beth
Rocks, but she outdid all her other
performances this weekend in the
800 meters.

Rocks won the event with a per-
sonal best time of 2 minutes, 6.25
seconds. The time automatically

qualified Rocks for the national

championships next month in
Fayetteville, Ark.

Rocks was quick to point out
the performance of teammate Janine
Jones, who who started the race at a
fast pace. Jones finished second
with a provisional qualification

time of 2:07.50.

“Janine took it out and led for
the first 400,” said Rocks, who
qualified for the national champi-
onships at Penn State on three sepa-
rate-occasions. “I wouldn’t have run
as fast if she didn’t. We can’t "win
without each other.”

“Beth’s race was really a combi-
nation of Beth and Janine and the
amount of work they’ve endured,”
Lewis added.

Although Jones’ 8 time doesn’t

‘guarantee that she’ll be headed to

Fayetteville with Rocks in March,
Lewis said the chances are pretty
slim she’ll be staying at home.

run faster than she,” Lewis said.
The women’s mile relay was

also victorious. The team of Kim

Lyles, Mera Belisle, Jones and

Elizabeth Bayne would have run"
even faster were it not for a near‘

collision with the competition. The
team finished with a“ time of
3:42.66, less than a second offa

, provisional time. 1

“They got cut off by another
team,” Lewis said. “They would’ve
provisionally qualified.”

Belisle also found some success
in the individual 400, finishing
third (55.76) to go along with ninth
place in the 60 dash (7.76).

Pitt was also represented well in
the men’s 800.

Jesse Chalfant ran one of his
fastest times of the“ year (1250.96)
against some of the best in the
country to (finish sixth. Freshman
Jeryl Wilborn was right there, ‘too,
finishing eighth (1252.05);

Chalfant and Wilborn teamed, up
with Ryan Smith and Maurice

Patterson in the mile relay and came‘

in 12th (3:21.07).

Patrick Harding stayed consis-
tent in the shot put, tossing for
16.58 meters and sixth place. An
18.07 throw in the weight event
gave Harding fourth place.

Amanda Walker had just as
good a day in the women’s ‘shot,
finishing sixth (14.11).

Other ' good performances
included Nicole Vann, a fifth place
finisher in the 60 hurdles (8.70) and
10th place finisher in the 200
(25.05), Lyles, who was fourth in
the 200 (24.33) and Lauren Shaffer,
who ended up fifth in the 5,000
(10:05.52). -

That’s it for the regular season.
Now it’s onto the Big East
Championships. in
Carrier Dome, where the team had
so much success last year. ,

Lewis said it’s going to be tough
though, (since the Pitt team doesn’t
have the quantity of some Big East
rivals.

“We don’t have the numbers of
other teams, so we’re going’to have

to work twice as hard,” Lewis said._
