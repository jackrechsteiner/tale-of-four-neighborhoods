Showered  
Towers students
awaiting cash

Senior Staff Writer

- After six weeks, students and University ofﬁcials are still
working to soak up the problems in Tower B. _ .

On Sept. 9, fire sprinklers on the 22nd ﬂoor of Tower B went
off, drenching that ﬂoor and leaking water as far down as the build-
i_ng’s 16th ﬂoor. .

Heather Frye, who lives in room 2201, said that the water
from the sprinklers ruined her leather coat, and that the University

gave her a $50 laundry certiﬁcate." ’ ‘

That day, she went to Housing Services to claim damages but
“they didn’t know what to do”pand told her to ﬁll out a standard
maintenance form. " ' ‘

After receiving no reply, Frye went back a week later when -

she received a different form, which she said was “more closely

‘related [to the incident] than amaintenance form, but it wasn’t like

a ‘ﬂood of 200] damage form.’” She has received no reply since

i R V she ﬁlled out the second form.

Postal workers  
die of possible
anthrax

D’VERA COHN
The Washington Post

WASHINGTON ——‘ Two D.C. postal workers have died
of what ofﬁcials suspect isanthrax, and two more have been
conﬁrmed as having the deadly inhalation form of the disease,
Dr. Ivan Walks, the Dist1ict’s chief health officer, told a news
conference Monday afternoon. A ’

Although anthrax has not been conﬁrmed in the two dead
workers, a blood test from one showed indications of anthrax
and symptoms in the second made it “highly suspicious” that
he had the disease, Walks said.

One of the workers died Sunday night at Greater

. Southeast Community Hospital, according to Tony Bullock, a
spokesman for D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams.

In addition to the two postal workers with a conﬁrmed
diagnosis of inhalation antlnax, at least two others are report-

LARA HUFFMAN
Staff Writer

In a bold declaration during a Security
Council meeting yesterday, a United
States representative resolved that the U.S.
would not tolerate terrorist attacks.

Today, she’s back in high school.

This representative was just one of an
estimated 300 who participated in the ﬁfth
annual Model United Nations Club
Conference sponsored by the Model
United Nations Club and the University
Center for International Studies yesterday
at Pitt‘.

High school students from 28 area
schools represented 44 countries in the
United Nations. Baldwin, Franklin, North
Allegheny and Washington were some of
the high schools that participated in yester-
day’s conference. Each high school repre-
sented a different country, depending on
its size.

The students divided into six comrnit—
tees: disarmament and international secu-
rity; economic and ﬁnancial council; eco-
nomic and social council; special political
and decolonization, World Health
Organization and the Security Council.

The’ committee meetings simulated
sessions of the United Nations General
Assembly where the students took on the
role of U.N. diplomats. Bangladesh, China
and Mali were several of the countries on
the Security Council.

The students discussed various inter-
national issues, including the Arab-Israeli
conﬂict, global poverty and sustainable
development, and international slave trade
and the war on drugs. The terrorist attacks
on Sept. 11 affected the overall tone of the
Security Council’s discussion. .

Members of Pitt’s Model U.N. Club
played several roles at the conference,
including working as moderators at the

Students play at U.N.

committee meetings.

“We have great Pitt students involved.
Without them, we wouldn’t have been
able to do this,” said Lisa George, presi-
dent of the club.

According to George, preparation for
the conference began last semester. In the
spring, the club started writing the scenar-
ios that the students used in its committee
meetings.

The club has about 50 active mem-
bers. George has been involved with the
Model United Nations for the past six
years, and she was the president of her
high school chapter of the club.

“It’s very engaging, and you can do a
lot,” she said. “Most of the people
involved are very well informed on world
affairs.”

Both stationary and roving judges
evaluated students in ﬁve categories —-
portrayal of the country, moderated and
unmoderated caucusing, resolution writ-
ing, formal debate and diplomacy. The
judges had professional experience in law,
journalism and academia.

Students ended the day where it first
began .— in David Lawrence Hall.
Students slouched in their seats and boys
loosened their ties amid the chatter.

Judges gave out the awards based on
their observations In the ﬁnal award in the
top overall country category, delegates
from France took third place, Iraq came in
second and China won first place honors.

This conference was the first for the
students from Springdale High School,
who represented Japan. They spent weeks
preparing for the event, but said they
would spend months for next year’s con-
ference.

“I thought it was fun, and a very good
learning experience,” student Brian
Baranowski said. “It opens you up to how
things are handled in international affairs.”

ing ﬂu—like symptoms and are presumed to
have been exposed to the disease, according
to officials.

Three people have now died from the
disease since a bafﬂing series of anthrax
poisonings began three weeks ago in
Florida. The ﬁrst was the photo editor for a
tabloid newspaper in Florida.

Among those conﬁrmed to have
anthrax is a postal worker who lives in
Stafford County,‘ Va. His diagnosis was
made public Sunday. That postal employee,
identiﬁed by co—workers as Leroy
Richmond, 57, was listed in serious condi-
tion at Inova Fairfax (Va.) Hospital. A
spokesman described him as suffering from
ﬂu-like symptoms. The second postal work-
er with conﬁrmed anthrax also is hospital-
ized in Fairfax, Walks said.

get antibiotics

He also said authorities are investigat-
ing as many as nine more cases that have
aroused concern.

Acting on the assumption that the
postal workers fell ill after handling an
anthrax--tainted letter —— perhaps the same
one that has caused a week of turmoil on
Capitol Hill — authorities began screening
and preemptive antibiotic treatment for

about 2,000 mail workers at the Districts

main processing center and for another 150
at an airmail center near Baltimore-
Washington International Airport. The ﬁrst
postal worker conﬁrmed to be infected han-
dled mail at both centers.

Hundreds of postal workers reported to
the former D.C. General Hospital building
Monday to be tested and to receive precau-
tionary antibiotics. Ofﬁcials said delivery of
the drugs was delayed by traffic problems
Monday morning.

University

didn’t get

claims

University spokesman Robert Hill
said, “The University has not received
claims ﬁled in connection to the sprinkler
problem.” '

He also said that when a student
decides to claim damages and ﬁlls out a
fonn at the housing department, those
forms are sent to the office of the executive
vice chancellor where they are reviewed on
a case-by—case basis. 2 A

The Pitt News contacted Eli Shorak in
the ofﬁce of the executive vice chancellor
regularly over the past month for informa-

, tion about the incident as well as general

information about ﬁre safety at Pitt. He has
yet to comment about the incident.

One ﬂoor down from Frye,- in "room
2101, is Elizabeth Hazzard’s room, which
was also drenched by leaks from the 22nd
ﬂoor. According to Hazzard, her computer
was ruined, her stereo was on the fritz for
weeks and other belongings were inepara-
bly damaged. And now, after insurance
paid for $1,800 worth of damages, she has
been trying to get $250 from the University

to pay the deductible. - A

Both Frye’s and Hazzard’s rooms
were wet enough to require employees
from Pitt’s Housing Services department to

. pass a wet—dry vacuum over the carpet.

Afterward, Frye’s carpet. dried without
incident, but Hazzard said that employees
vacuumed" around the beds, not under
them. _

_ - Soon, Hazzard said, the room began to
smell, and for three weeks, the students of

2101 had to keep their windows open to 

alleviate the odor. A

A few , weeks ago, the University
installed new carpet, but, nearly ﬁve weeks
since the incident occurred, Hazzard is still
working to get her deductible.

Hazzard said that so far, all she man-
aged to get is a verbal promise from Harry
Burner, Pitt’s director of housing adminis-
tration, that she will get the $250.

That was on Sept. 25.

Burner did not return phone calls and
his ofﬁce referred The Pitt-News to Hill.

“I’m not going to discuss individual ‘

students’ affairs  that would be inappro-

priate,” Hill said.

Hill said that investigations by facili-
ties management and the city ﬁre depart-
ment have only found that some sort of
heat, the source of which is still unknown,
set off the sprinklers.

Hill also said that the sprinkler equip-
ment testing determined that the incident
was not due to a malfunction.

“I’m going to wait it out to see if the
money comes,” Hazzard said.

Candidates unhappy with Murphy’s priorities

Candidates, page 1

here. Candidates blamed population loss
on high taxes, a poor education system and

overemphasis on improving Downtown.

Weinroth explained that he cares about
the population loss in Pittsburgh because
he doesn’t want his daughter to have to ﬁnd
a job somewhere else when she grows up.
He proposed cutting taxes, developing the
riverfront and improving education to
attract residents.

- Roston blamed the population loss,
including ﬂeeing college graduates, on
Pittsburgh’s “raggedy neighborhoods.” He

_ proposed putting gun—toting young people

involved in drug related violence to work
ﬁxing dilapidated houses and building new
ones on empty lots.

He also blamed Murphy, who is run-
ning for re—election but did not attend the
event, for pouring too much money into
Downtown and for hiring out—of—town
companies to complete the projects.

“All the money that comes over the
mayor’s desk goes to the North Side,”
Roston said. “No one is _looking at the
whole picture.”

Carmine also emphasized a different
perspective on improving the city.

“Pittsburgh is not its buildings.
Pittsburgh is its people,”‘he said. “A mayor

who wants to take care of his city needs to
take care of the people who live in the
city.” 2

Carmine proposed supporting small
local businesses rather than “bribing”
national companies to come to the city. '

He also emphasized improving
Pittsburgh schools.

“If you want those bright people to

move here, those people whose success .

depends upon their education, then provide
education for their children,” Carmine said.

Tomorrow, from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m.,
the candidates will speak again and
respond to questions‘ at the Carnegie
Library Lecture Hall.

Tower shower: for many, the

ﬂood isn’t over

According to the book of Genesis,
the world ﬂooded for 40 days and 40
nights. .

On Sept. 9, parts of Tower B_ ﬂood-
ed for only a few hours. But it’s been
more than 40 days and 40 nights (44 to
be exact) since many students lost valu-
able items to the torrent of water, and
they have yet to see a drop of compen-
sation from the University.

Whatever triggered the sprinkler
system -— whether it was heat or a mal-
function — the victims of the ﬂood are
not at fault. Since they live in a Pitt-
owned building, the University owes
them money for what they lost.

The University showed its kindness
to the students whose homes on Meyran
Avenue burned. It should do the same
for the students in Tower B.

Much of what they lost costs a lot
to 5 replace. Freshman Elizabeth
Hazzard, for example, lost items whose
value totaled $1,800. She was lucky —
her parents’ homeowners’ insurance
covered it, although she had to pay a
$250 deductible. Harry Burner in the
housing services department agreed to
reimburse her the $250. That was Sept.
25, and she has not yet seen a dime. Yet
she may be the lucky one.

What about the students whose par-

ents’ insurance didn’t cover the items in
their rooms? What if they had no insur-
ance at all?

What if a student cannot afford to
replace damaged belongings, like com-
puters? He or she has to deal with the
inconvenience of trudging to the com-
puter labs while waiting for a new com-
puter.

And this does not even include
books — which students likely had to
buy again immediately — and class
notes, which one can only replace after‘
quite a bit of inconvenience.

The University could have made
the past month and a half easier on
these students by compensating them in
a timely fashion. But instead their
money remains mired in bureaucratic

‘red tape. The Pitt News attempted to

contact Eli Shorak in the office of the
executive vice chancellor, which is
responsible for damage claims, but he
has refused to comment for a month.
Pitt spokesman Robert Hill denied that
the University even received any dam-
age claims, which is simply untrue.

Many already consider the Towers

See the person, not just the label

A few months ago, I walked into a
punk concert and ' received the biggest
stare—down of my life. According to the
laws of the (urban) jungle, whoever
breaks the gaze ﬁrst loses and therefore
submits. Never one to roll myself over
and expose my ﬂeshy little underbelly, I

that chlamydia doesn’t afflict mollusks,
but also that the “h” is silent. These things

But it is unfair to expect '

The dress. compromised my punk
rock integrity. Its fit and fabric
telegraphed my inferiority and ignorance

these observers. And it answered the
question, “Are you punk enough?” and
the question hung silently over the room

a resounding f‘no.”

would also be unfair to people

Girls whodress like whores distractive, not attractive

I am prone to distraction. Whether
it be a beautiful brunette, a federalist
with Lyndon Larouche pamphlets or a
squirrel that’s not afraid of me, I am
likely to bite my bottom lip, get a stu-
pid smirk on my face and totally lose
my train of thought. V

But_I especially find women dis-
tracting, and in that regard, I am fairly
representative of men in general.

It’s the same scenario everyday:
I’m walking down the street when I
see her walking the other way. While
her hair veils her face, everything else
seems to be in order, so I wonder, “Is
she hot?”

I will probably never talk to her -—'
much less date her -— but I still have to
know. Something clicks inside my
brain triggering a heightened curiosity,
as though I just caught a quick glimpse
of Elvis or Tupac. Could it be?

To make things even more diffi-
cult, most, if not all, women just love

the attention. They know exactly what

they’re doing. This is especially evi-
dent when the weekend rolls around.
As early as 6 p.m., countless Pitt girls
begin the process of getting “whored

up.” After they have soaked them-

selves with perfume, painted their legs
black to create the illusion of pants

‘and slid into something like a red,

sequined bikini top, they hit the streets
of Oakland in packs.

Here’s where I come in. The spin-
ning kaleidoscope of colors and smells
hits me like a tidal wave. My head
jerks spasmodically in different direc-
tions like a deer that senses danger,
and I am still unable to take it all in. It
gets to the point where I can barely

' The problem lies in a failure of
distinction. Girls are seemingly unable

to tell the difference between being-

attractive and being distractive. I say
this because their party garb is merely
distracting’, and if they are looking to
distract me, all they have to do is show
up. As far as being attractive, well,
what I’m looking for is a girl I can

remember my name, much
less where I am going.
Late on Saturday night,
I took a timeout from it all.
I spent much of the evening
on an Atwood Street porch
with my friend John, and
we discussed such women
and our feelings on "them.
We must have sounded like
a pair old men. Each time a

take home to mom, not to
“The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.”

Ladies, whether you
realize it or not, you are
defined by the clothes you
wear, and you may be
sending a message you
don’t mean to. If I see you

you’re dressed like girls

girl would walk by, one of
us would make a comment like, “I
wonder if her father knows she wears
stuff like that.”

I used to get a kick out of girls
who were dressed likethat back in
10th grade, but now it’s not as appeal-
ing. Maybe it’s just my romanticized
view of everything, or maybe my
tastes have matured, but I am no
longer attracted to that type. Don’t get
me wrong, they always catch my eye,
but they don’t hold it. I

typically do, I immediate-
ly draw conclusions about your plans
for the evening, which probably
include getting drunk, getting felt up
and falling asleep on somebody else’s
couch. I may be completely wrong in
that assumption, but I will still proba-
bly make it — and so will most of the
other guys you meet along the way.
Most of the girls at Pitt —, and at
least 20‘percent of the guys — are
interested in a meaningful relation-
ship. Making the connection between

on a Saturday night and.

these two groups does not involve
either person (especially the man)
dressing like a whore. To verify this
assertion, my friend John, being an
average guy,. had this to say about
scantily clad girls: “If my girlfriend
were dressed like that  well, my
girlfriend wouldn’t be dressed like
that.”

Looking at the situation objective-
ly, without the haze of alcohol or nar-

cotics, allows us to see the whole‘

game for what it is: primitive. I’m not
looking to head out each evening with
a club to bash that special lady over
the head and drag her back to my cave.
I’m looking to have a good time, enjoy
her company and maybe even (gasp!)
build a friendship or two. Then maybe
I will build from there.

My advice to the modern college
girl is this: invest in some hooded
sweatshirts. The cozy — and less dis-
tracting —— appeal of the hooded
sweatshirt is more attractive than the

tank top — or whatever you call it — _

and its warm embrace may solve the
problem for you by canceling out any
desire for a meaningful relationship.

fonner by the latter ﬂashed in my head. People who let first

impressions rule their beliefs surprise me continually. Beyond _

well-publicized cases of racial proﬁling and sexism, there are
millions of subtle prejudices that affect us, whether intentionally
or subconsciously. _
Having to ﬁt ‘a niche perfectly and then prove ourselves
smart enough, punk enough, pretentious—obscure-narne—drop-
ping enough for it leads only to exclusiveness akin to children at
a sandbox: “No, you can’t play with us — your shorts are red.”
Similarly, I expected to hear, “No, you can’t party with us —-

you’re not wearing pants that resemble the Hindenberg in size

and scope.”

This practice is childish. It also fails to see and celebrate the
human inconsistencies and contradictions that color life. I know
ballet—dancing punk rockers and self-proclaimed candy kids who
love to scream along to blasting country music. I’ve seen rap

I fans proclaim their love for “La Traviata” and Izod-wearing ath-

letes get down to Grandmaster Flash.

We love to simplify. We love to say that A can never be B
and deny that most of humanity is as mixed-up as a 2-year-old’s
ﬁnger painting with, red smearing into green and blue overlap-
ping orange. But life never makes things as easy as a Jackson
Five song. We need to accept, to understand and to connect with
others by reaching over the walls of our self-imposed pigeon-

‘holes.

If a punk rocker can wear hippie clothing, there’s no guess-

ing what kind of friendly freak will walk in next.

Columnist Sydney Bergman hates it when people try to contort
her to ﬁt into a box.

First and foremost, hello to all who are receiv-
ing this email. My name is Nkemjika Ofodile, and
the reason that I have written you this letter, is that

. in some way, shape or form, you expressed irrita-

tion at the letter that I wrote the Pitt News. While I
cannot change your opinion, and in all actuality am

not looking to do so, I would like to try to explain -

it to you a little more clearly so that you understand
where I am coming from. To begin with, the issue
of this being a “race issue” was never brought up
by me. Some of you read into it that way, but you
should never try to look deeper than the literal
meaning. What I said was “...great strides have
been made for the minority community this week-
end...” This is to mean that NEVER in the history
of Pitt has there ever been a minority king and
queen. It may not mean that much to you, howev-
er, the minority community on this campus felt it
was quite signiﬁcant. There was another line in
which I wrote that the Pitt News was attempting to
suppress the crowning from being told to the
University of Pitt commumty. However, again, if
you read the text, you would see that these —two
lines are very separate, and that all I meant was that
the information of the crowning was suppressed

. information. Period. You ‘called. me petty, shallow,

the list goes on, and again, that is your opinion, but
when you work hard, and I am sure that this applies

I a fruit for your labor. I found it amusing that you

said that it was nothing more than a popularity con-
test, but those words were irrelevant because it IS a
popularity contest. «Whoever said you needed cre-
dentials to be a Homecoming Queen? Next,
anthrax, and the Sept. 11 issues are deﬁnitely big, I
never contested that, but according to’ what a lot of
you said, I was crying for a front page picture.
Negative. '1 simply said more than the back of my
head, as well as a picture of Penny, and maybe even
the court would have sufﬁced. However, I was told

that none of them came out. Whatever. And while _

yes, there were more pressing matters, there were
also articles such as parents are your friends too, or
want a degree in overachievers studies. So your

argument is not completely well founded. One last .

thing that I wanted to say is that the. majority of you
said that most people don’t care about
Homecoming. I would put money on it that that is
more of a personal opinion than majority, but its all
relative, think what you want. I could go on, how-
ever, I think that that would be futile as it would just
be me trying to refute all of your opinions, when in

‘reality, I just wanted to clear up some facts.

A big

The Panthers 2001 football campaign can be
summed up in one word: disappointing. After
Saturday’s 45-7 thrashing by Boston College, a defeat-
ed Walt /Harris used David Priest_ley’s two intercep-
tions as the model for the team’s problems.- .

“Two plays are a microcosmiof our season,” ‘head
coach Harris said. “The first was the interception
tipped into a linebacker’s belly. Also, on the touch-
down attempt to Antonio [Bryant], we didn’t finish our
block and the ball was underthrown and “intercepted.”

Turnovers killed Pitt this season. Seven intercep-
tions from Priestley and eight Pitt fumbles this season
forced the defense to be on the field for an extraordi-
nary amount of time. The turnovers also give oppo-

The 10-hour trip to Boston
College was well worth it last
weekend.

With, of course, the exception
of the four hours I spent at Alumni
Stadium.

Just when you thought that the
football team couldn’t play any
worse, just when you thought that
the team hit rock bottom, the team
surprised everyone by playing at an
even worse level of play and last
weekend’s performance will no
doubt affect a lot of people.

But it would be way too easy to
kick this team right now. As much
as the Pitt players were pushed and
shoved all over the field, the play-
ers’ egos and mental states are cur-
rently the most bruised.

Watching Walt Harris step up to
the podium for his postgame press
conference on Saturday was a sorry
sight. The coach, who has become
endeared by the student body,
looked like a car had just hit him
when he said felt “empty_.”

His face was almost as" pale as
his white Pitt polo shirt. The only
colors showing were those of the
American flag pin on his collar.

It was during summer camp
when Harris stated that he was flat-
tered by all of the positive press
that was directed toward his team,
but that his team had a lot of work

but he isn’t giving up.

“I know I’ve been through this before,” Harris said. '
“I’m a leader of men and I have a responsibility. It’s
not a life or death situation, but it’s still awful impor-

tant.”

“There arethree things that hurt us,” Harris contin-
ued. “A, turnovers. B, the long play, and C, a short

field to defend.”

Throughout the morning, the media bombarded
Harris with questions about expectations. Many times,
Harris would just shake his head or use hand signals to

attempt to show media members what he was saying.

He asked the media, “I thought you guys were

Men’s soccer gets first conference win i

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The men’s soccer team won its first

Big East game of the year this weekend ,

defeating Providence, 3-2.

Providence was not only looking for
its first win in the Big East, but for the sea-
son. The seesaw battle between the two
schools ended with the Panthers spoiling
the Friars’ hopes by defeating them for the
second consecutive year by a one-goal
margin. A

The Friars’ freshman midfielder
Carlos Suero got the Friars’ offense rolling

in the first half. Suero gave Providence the '

early lead when he headed in a cross pass
from senior midﬁelder Thomas Blesso, 17
minutes into the game. '

Pitt tied the game in the 40th minute
as Chris Churchill scored from 20 yards
out on Providence goalkeeper Michael
Greulich, off a direct free kick.

The Panthers went ahead in the 60th

minute of the game when iunior rnidf1eld— ’

er John Occhiuto passed to freshman for-
ward Jeff Krause for the score. Krause’s
goal, the first of his career, put Pittsburgh
ahead 2-1. Occhiuto assisted on the goal,
which was his first point as a Panther since
transferring from Cariisius.

Providence struckback in the 72nd
minute." The Friars’ junior Jon Alva-

. Cavero sent a shot screaming towards the

Panther goal, but Panther goalkeeper
Justin Gaul blocked it. Gaul could not gain
control of the shot as Andrew Bussman
scored off of the rebound, tying the game
2-2. 5
‘ With 7:35 left in" the game, Mark
Sikora scored for the Panthers on a break-
away, giving them a 3-2 lead. Sikora’s

goal was his third of the season, which,"

turned out to be the winning‘ goal.
“Mark is a player that we are counting

. on playing big and he did exactly that,”

coach Joe Luxbacher said. “He got off to a

slow start at the beginning of the season,
but hopefully he can keep producing like
he did against Providence.”

The Friars’ hopes of tying the game
were shattered as Gaul denied a shot by
sophomore Greg Bennett with 3 seconds
left in the game. ~ _

“Justin made a big" time save at the
end of the game. The kid has been playing
tough all year,” Luxbacher said. ‘Gaul had
eight saves /for the game.

For the game, the Panthers were out-
shot by, the Friars l7-13. Sikora led the
Panthers with four shots on goal. Pitt
improved their record to 4-7-1 overall and

‘1-5-1 in the Big East. Providence fell to 0-‘

10-2 overall and 0-6 in conference play.
Luxbacher insisted that in order for
the men’s team to take a step forward, they
must play better defensively overall. The
Panthers play

 

Robert Morris on .
Wednesday at 3p.m. and will be consid-
ered a home game for the Panthers.

going to tell me that we huddled
last week, and had very few shot-
guns.” Harris’ sarcasm here was in
reference to the media’s question-

. ing of his play calling, in previous

weeks. .

But the only thing anyone was
interested in was Pitt’s season—1ong
decline. .

Harris got frustrated at times
and said, “If I had all the answers,
we’d, man...” He never finished his
thought and slammed his fist onto
the table in front of him.

Last season, the Panthers
excelled in scoring quickly as then-
quarterback'John Turman led the
Panthers to 77 plays of 20 or more
yards throughout the season. This
year, the Panthers aren’t getting
nearly as many long gains.

The reason for this dramatic
change in the Panthers offense over
one year escapes Harris’ mind.

“I don’t know if ‘hocus—pocus’
is out there,” Harris said. “But there
are unique things happening to this
football team.”

Harris continued to talk about
how to win football games. He did-
n’t blame any one person for the
underachievement of the team, but
he did say that trusting your team-
mates is a key element under these
circumstances.

“We can’t have 10 guys execute
and one guy not,” he said. “That’s
what is happening. We got to have
trust in each other.”

With a bowl opportunity fading
quickly, looking ahead to next sea-
son is seemingly an unavoidable
circumstance.

Harris, on the other hand, seems
to be avoiding next season easily,
by only looking at one thing.

“The only area I’m looking at
towards next season is recruiting,”
Harris said. “We need to worry
about this  notnext play or last
play”   . , _ .

This Saturday, the Panthers take
on Temple (2-4, 1-2) at Veterans
Stadium in Philadelphia. Last sea-
son Pitt beat Temple in 7-0 at
Veterans Stadium.

Tony Dorsett helped to lead Pitt to a national championship in 1976, winning the
Heisman Trophy and setting the record for most career rushing yards.

Road named after Dorsett

- KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

In the "703 Tony Dorsettwas an

‘integral part of many Pitt drives.

Now he’ll be a fixture in the driving
routes of Pittsburghers as “Tony
Dorsett Drive” will replace a section
of Martindale Street.

The Sports

the name of Martindale Street
between North Shore Drive and
Reedsdale Street. A source at‘ the
SEA board said that it will be
announced during the Nov. 3
Virginia Tech game. I _

“I’m honored, humbled, sur-
prised and somewhat embarrassed to
be recognized this way,” Dorsett,‘a
native of Aliquippa, said.

“Home is home and being from
the Pittsburgh area it is an incredible
honor to have a street named after
yourself right by the'ci.ty’s two great
new stadiums.”

During his time at Pitt, from
1973-1976, Dorsett received such
honors as the Heisman Trophy, along
with four All-American citations and

induction into the pro and college,

football Halls of Fame.

“This is a fitting honor for one of
the greatest athletes to ever play the
game of football,” Pitt athletic direc-

and Exhibition.‘
Authority board decided to change.

tor Steve Pederson said. “The entire
University of Pittsburgh family con-

gratulates Tony and we are so proud‘ ‘

to call him a Panther.” -
During his collegiate career,

Dorsett set the all—time NCAA rush— /

ing record with 6,082 yards, a mark
that stood for 22 seasons before
Texas’ Ricky Williams broke the
record. Dorsett rushed for 100 or
more yards 36 times, including a
span of 20 consecutive games. '

In his 12 seasons that he spent in
the NFL, Dorsett made his mark as a
Dallas Cowboy (1977-1987) and as a
Denver Bronco (1988-1989) compil- I

' ing 12,739 yards, which is still good

for fifth on the NFL all—time list.

The year before Dorsett arrived
at Pitt, the team finished with a 1-10
record. He helped to turn around the
program, by leading the team to «a
national championship in 1976,
when the team went 12-0. He set or
tied an incredible 18 collegiate rush—
ing records, more than any other
player in the history of college foot-
ball.

Dorsett holds the distinction of
being the only ‘player in football his-
tory to win the Heisman Trophy, a
collegiate national championship, a
Super Bowl championship and to be
selected into both the college and
professional Halls of Fame.

that his team would live up to the
hype.

Yet, the media neglected Harris’
comments. All media outlets placed
Pitt at the top of the Big East as a
possible stumbling block for Miami
and Virginia Tech. But the only
stumbling that persists is Pitt’s
inability to execute a complicated
offense and a defense that remains
on the field too long.‘

The media’s questions about
Harris’ decisions this season remain

_unanswered. There have not been

conclusive answers as'to why he
still shuffles the quarterbacks, no
signs of the offense~being simplified
and no signs of him relinquishing
the offensive play calling duties.

David Priestley has no confi-
dence on. the field and it shows. In
his last four games, which all result-
ed in losses, Priestley threw for 443
yards and seven interceptions.

He holds onto the ball too long
in the pocket, which result in sacks.
He holds onto the ball too long
before he passes, which results in
cornerbacks telegraphing his passes.
Constantly he under— and over-
throws his targets

Yet "Harris,

who brought

Priestley with him from Ohio State,
continues to play the much-
maligned- quarterback. What’s the
point? There are four games left in
this abortion of a season and then
Priestley will officially run out of
eligibility and will be back on his
way to California  I hope.

That leaves Rod Rutherford as
the only other quarterback with
experience on the roster. How much
longer will he be robbed of precious
playing time? Harris needs to put
him in because at this point, it does-
n’t matter if he makes mistakes.

Today will be the players’ first
day back to work. Harris told them
to think over if they want to be
coached and play under his system.

Up to this point, the Panthers
showed no resilience i.n the face of

-adversity and several teams buried

them.
This weekend the team plays

Temple, a big game for this pro-

gram.

If Harris’ players respond to
Temple — who is anything but stel-
lar —— it will show that Harris does
have a handle on this team. If the
team doesn’t show up and it loses on
Saturday, then the rebuilding
process that athletic director Steve
Pederson forged will look like it

hasn’t even gotten off the ground.

If this group of players doesn’t
perform this weekend, it will prove
that Harris has been ineffective as a
head coach and that this team does
not fear, respect or want to play for
him and that would be more devas-
tating than any poor record.

It is safe to say that some assis-
tant coaches, if not all of them, will
feel the brunt of this underachieving
season. It is also safe to say that
Harris’ job is safe, but if the team
lacks passion again this weekend,
the ambush of questions will be
much harder and much more vicious
than ever before. ’

When Harris first came to the
University, he had the luxury of the
supporters’ patience. If the team was
struggling, it was O.K. because the
team was in the midst of a rebuild-
ing process.

But with two bowl seasons
under his belt, the standard has been
risen and with that, comes expecta-
tions.

The honeymoon is over.

Kenneth Paul is the sports editorfor
The Pitt News and if Pitt does not
win this weekend, he may throw a
famous rock hard Philly pretzel at a
gold and blue jersey.
