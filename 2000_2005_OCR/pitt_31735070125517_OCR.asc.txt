Mike Ditka (No. 89), Tony Dorsett
(33), Bill Fralic (42), Marshall
Goldberg (42), Hugh Green (99),
Dan Marino (13) and Joe Schmidt
(65). .

“I remember being in our locker
room as a collegiate player and see-
ing Tony Dorsett’s glass-encased
retired locker,” May ‘said. “There
have been so many great players
here, and to have your name added
to the list of retired jerseys is a
tremendous thrill.”

May was quickly anointed with
the nickname “May Day” for the
problems that he caused for defen-
sive linemen.

He was a member of one of the
greatest recruiting classes in Panther
history. The 1977 class consisted of
several standouts, including Green,

Rickey Jackson, Russ Grimm and

Greg Meisner.
Pitt went 11-1 in May’s senior

season in 1980. The team finished‘

second in the Associated Press poll,
and The New York Times computer
poll rated the Panthers as the best
team in the country.

In his four years at Pitt, May and
his teammates accumulated a 39-8-1
record that featured four bowl games
and three top 10 finishes.

May was a quarterback’s dream
protector —— he did not give up a
sack in his final two collegiate sea-
sons. During the 1980 season he was
named a consensus All-American

and winner of the .prestigious
Outland Trophy.

After May concluded his senior
season, he played in the Hula Bowl
and Japan Bowl all-star games. ,

He continued to be a success on
the field after college as we1l.'The
Washington Redskins selected May
in the first round of the 1981 NFL

-draft, where he achieved fame as a

member of the team’s «dominating
offensive line that was dubbed the
“Hogs.” '
May helped the Redskins reach
three Super Bowls, in the 1982, 1983
and 1987 seasons. The team won the
championship in ‘82 and ‘87, and
May was selected to play in the Pro
Bowl following the ‘88 season. That
year he surrendered’ just one sack
and was the only Washington offen-

May was a mainstay on the
Redskins’ offensive line from 1981
to 1990. He finished his" playing
days by spending one year with the

-San Diego Chargers and concluded

his final two seasons as a member of
the Phoenix Cardinals in 1992-1993.

After retiring from the NFL,’

May ventured into a successful
broadcasting career.

He broke into broadcasting in
1994 when he joined Bill Hillgrove

for Panther radio broadcasts. He has

recently joined ESPN as'aMstudio
host and color analyst for the net-
work’s college football coverage.
Before going to ESPN, he worked
with CBS and TNT as an analyst for
both of their NFLbroadcasts.
“Without a doubtthis is one of

the highest athletic achievements of '

my career and I’Ve been to three
Super Bowls, a Pro_Bowl and was on
some great teams at the University
of Pittsburgh,” May said. “It is even
more of an honor to have your num-

I ber retired ata school with the foot-

ball tradition of Pittsburgh.”
