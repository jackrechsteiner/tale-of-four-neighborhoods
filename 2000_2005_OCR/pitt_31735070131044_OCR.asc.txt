City council, who overrode Mayor
Tom Mu1phy’s veto on the new vending
ordinance and passed it into law, is
attempting to relocate the , vendors who‘
have to vacate their metered parking spots.
Even though the new ordinance takes
effect on Jan. 1, 2001, no new vending

‘ areas have been determined.

the vendors.

green space betweenfthe Hillman Library

and the parking lot,” Cohen said. “Right
now it’s just an idea.” '

Despite the controversial parking
ainqidrnent, other changes in the ordi-
nance pose problems to the vendors,
although these changes are more manage-
able than  a designated vending

' “I do think that
vendors can add value
to property, because if
it’s done right, they can
be charming and can

city with more information, such as a busi-
ness description and employee informa-

tion. Also, vendors will be required to

insure theirbusinesses, and the cost of ven-
dor perrnits will be increased to $500-

‘ $1000, depending on the type of vending

situation. _

Paired together with the city permit,
vendors are also required tolobtain a permit
from the Health Department. This permit
regulates the food safety and conditions of
the food facility. The requirements are the
same for all food providers, whether it be
vendor or a restaurant. ‘

All food facilities are inspected at least

once a year and when complaints are ﬁled.

Those buying back books will also be aifected by the city’s new
ordinance to remove vendors from parking meters in Pittsburgh.

Out -- of the. 9,000 food facilities in
Allegheny County, a significant number of
complaints are received each "year, bu
enforcements are rarely needed. ’
“In the course of a year, we deal with
about 100 enforcements; said Guillermo
Cole, the spokesman for . the Health
Department. ‘ '
Despite complaints and enforcements,

‘none of the Health Department’s regula-

tions are changing this year.

The new changes come as a compro-
mise between the vendors and the city,
since all of the parties involved understand
the current disarray with the vending situ-

ation.

“The ordinance that was proposed was
fair to both sides, no side got everything
that they wanted,” said Chaz Bonasorte, an

Oakland vendor who sells Pitt apparel. “It I

Debate Union cracks top 1 in country

JASON BARRANTI

The Pitt News

Wlliarn Pitt  Union, Pitt’s
nationally ranked debate team, has made its
way into the top 10  teams. V

The team is made up of 13 undergrad-
uate students taking part in an intercollegiate
policy debate and seven undergraduates par-
taking in public debate. The team also con-
sists of three graduate students assisting the
director of debate, Dr. Gordon R. Mitchell.

Mitchell, originally from Pittsburgh,
competed on a debate team when he was in
high school. He studied argumentation and
rhetoric at Wake Forest University and then
at Northwestern University, where he
earned his Ph.D.

 

Mitchell said he’s very enthusiastic
about his team. “This team is packed with
young and talented debaters just hitting ﬂieir
stride,” he said. A

With topics focusing on complex and
involved issues, the debate team necessarily
commands a great deal of knowledge.
“Resolved: That the U.S. federal govern-

ment should substantially increase its devel- .

opment assistance, including govemment-
to-govemment assistance, ’ within the
Greater Horn of Africa.” In all of its com-
plexity,“that is the topic of debate for the
team this term. ‘

And through the complexity of their

debates, theteamhasrnanagedtoattain
national standing. The team is ranked sixth
out of 127 ranked schools in the debates.
That ranking places it ahead of schools such

as Boston College, Cornell and Harvard.
‘The debate team is open to students of
any age. In fact, many students are actually
 out of high school and receive
scholarships for debating at Pitt:

 This year, the team has traveled nearly
10,000 miles to nine'diﬂ'enent tournaments.
During’ the fall term, team members debated
in ‘ laces such as Washington, D.C., West
Point Military Academy and Harvard
University in Cambridge, Mass.

j The debate team will log another sever-
al hundred miles when it starts off the next
term by attending debates at the University
of California‘ and the University of
Califomia at Fullerton, both located in Los
Angeles.

The team begins debating on Dec. 29
and will complete the tournament on J an. 4.

Black Consciousness is the name .of
the class. But judging by the yawns and
glazed faces of the students, you would
think everyone was unconscious. As the
lecturer speaks, silence seems to be the
only one listening.

The instructor makes an example out
of one student who is fast asleep at his
desk with lecture—heavy drool leaking
from his mouth.

built. He wants students to challenge what
he calls a curriculum heavily biased in
Europeans’ favor. Often he expresses a
point and qualiﬁes it by saying, ‘.‘This is
what European scholars teach us.” Then
he concludes‘ his point by declaring,
“However, African scholars teach us 
One famous reminder he leaves with
his students is to take two sets of notes;
“One to get an A, and one to get away.”
That Penny is 60 years old is rather
misleading. Although he barely stands
over 5 feet tall, he looks more like a sea-
soned citizen

“We called that a
dead Negro back in
my day,” says the pro-

   
     

class. The eruption of
laughter wakes the
embarrassed person,
and he lifts his head from the desk, tlying
to catch his drool before it’s noticed.

Too late. More laughter pours in on
him as he shakes his head in shame.

Quickly the teacher jumps back into
his lecture hoping he can catch the stu-
dents while they’re still somewhat recep-
tive. He keeps the students engaged, mov-
ing into issues of gender —— something
guaranteed to draw crossﬁre in the class.
He drops into other controversial discus-
sions, introducing each one by stating
something sure to get someone boiling.

‘"There’s no such thing as the Middle
East,” he blmts out, assured that someone
will be quick to dispute. ‘The mapping of
the Middle East is a deliberate attempt by
historians and cartographers to classify
Northeastern African countries, such as
Egypt, as Asian or Mediterranean.”

This is how Pitt professor Rob Penny
teaches his classes. He throws something
hot at his students and sees how long they
can hold it or what they can do with it. He

P yeams to know if students are aware ——

“conscious” —-—y of the rich cultures and
legacies of Africa and blacks across the

Diaspora. He ﬁnds it urgent that people be ,

How one man went from
poet to professor

than a senior citi-
zen. Talking with
him is like listen-
ing to a highly
decorated officer
who has seen his
share of battles.
Top-rank ofﬁcial,
yes, but instead of a full metal jacket,
Penny dons a casual sweater with relaxed-
ﬁt pants. Instead of a battered helmet, he
sports a knit kuﬁ that sits just above long
black and silver locks. His presence is like
that of a biblical wiseman or an elder
African sage: enlightening and hallowed.

“I call him ‘Oba,’” said Dr. Jack
Daniel, who, in forming the black studies
department, brought Penny to Pitt. Oba is
the Yoruban term for king.

In talking to Penny, one might sense
that he feels that his story pales in com-
parison to the hundreds of other stories
needed to be told regarding blacks. When
he answers questions, his responses corre-
spond to himself just brieﬂy before
expanding to the fuller scope of the state
of blacks in general. There is a collectivi-
ty about him that won’t be denied on any
platform.

Instead of a prolix account of his
awards won as a track star during his high

school years, he draws up an in-depth ‘

examination of the superﬂuous athleti-
cism of the black man and the gross mar-
keting of such a ﬁgure. '

From there he moves to what he per-
ceives as the sham of the Olympics and

ball leagues took an excruciating toll on
the psyche and soul of black baseball
players like Jackie Robinson. ‘
All that he wants others to know
about his Catholic upbringing and

FROM PAGE 2

Catholic schooling is that he gained noth— .

ing from it. He can’t mention one teacher
or parishioner who had any impact upon
his life; no event happened in St. Benedict
the Moor church or Holy Trinity school
that inspired Penny to be who he istoday.
In fact, he appears more than happy
when he says that it was the moment that
he stripped himself of his own Catholic
trappings that he began self—realization.
Penny not only rejected the religion’
he grew up with; he also rejected college.
The self—proclaimed “Hill District gradu-
ate’? spent his adolescent years buried
deep in books and music. During the ‘SOS,
jazz and poetry became candy for.Penny’s
ears. The “free jazz” sounds of John
Coltrane and Omette Coleman complete-
ly enthralled him. The “beat” poetry of
LeRoi J ones provided Pennywith a land:

‘ scape for what he would later become.

Several years later Penny could be
found hanging out in the Hill District on
Centre Avenue among others who shared
his love of poetry and jazz. One ofthose in
Penny’s assembly was August W"ilson,‘a

close friend who would later pen
nationally acclaimed plays such
as “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”
and “Fences,” which starred
James Earl Jones.

Penny came to Pitt in 1965
as a performance artist. The
African-American Cultural
Society, the predecessor to Pitt’s

Penny and others from the com-

and perform plays.

It was also at this time that
a tide was turning in an ever
race—conscious America.
Malcolm X was assassinated,
the Civil Rights movement
transformed into the Black
Power Movement, and students
on college campuses every-
where were in ‘rebellion. None of these
events sidestepped Pittsburgh.

Inspired by incidents that took place
at Cornell University and San Francisco
State University, where black students
were demonstrating and making demands,
black students at Pitt waged their own
revolt. Students led a brigade against the
Pitt administration demanding, among
other things, a school for black studies and
more black faculty members. ‘ V

‘ The students held the Cathedral com-
puter lab under siege until their proposal
was honored. ‘

Penny was brought in from the black L

community for _ additional support.
Described by some as a “quiet warrior,’f
Penny was instrumental in the ﬁght for
black students and was one of the first pro-
fessors recruited when the University con-
ceded and gave way to a black studies
department-

When the department opened, Penny
was registered as Pitt’s “poet-in—resi-
dence” and»—began his career at Pitt by
drafting the’ class that wo11ld become
Black Consciousness.

Many students regardPenny’s lecture
as one _of the most important classes they
have ever taken. , j

“The class inﬂuenced my deﬁnition

‘of being black in America,” said junior
Shana Watson. “It also gave me direction
as to how to help my people.”

but across the city.

“I think this ordinance will improve
the vending situation, but remember laws“
are only as good as their enforcement,”
Cohen said. .

Enforcement remains the biggest
problem with the current vending situa-
tion. Councilman Jim Ferlo, who spon-
sored the new ordinance, failed to return
phone calls, but spoke about the enforce-
ment problem at a city council meeting. "

“Where I fault the current situation, I
fault the Parking Authority for not effec-
tively, equitably and uniformly enforcing
its own code,” said Ferlo at a Sept. 28

meeting. “I dOn’t know how those vans are
currently parked continually  on a 24-
hour basis throughout the city and/or
Oakland — that’s in violation of current

I laws.”

The controversial parking amendment
was not mentioned at this meeting, but was
thrown in at the end in hopes of eliminat-
ing the parking problem. Pressured by
OBID, who also failed to return phone
calls, and Pitt, the parking amendment is
now law. The city and the vending com-
munity will have to wait to see if improve—
merits follow the new Ordinance. ‘.

Glancing around his Office, Cohen
takes a deep breath and sighs. “The major
issue is the valuable parking spots,” he

said. “I learned in this job that parking is

more important than world peace.” g

Lemieux champions over Aguilera

It’s been an exceptional week for
the city of Pittsburgh.

On Tuesday, Wexford native
Christina Aguilera won female artist of
the year at the Billboard Music
Awards. Yesterday, there was more
good news in the Iron City —- it was
revealed that Mario Lemieux will be
playing for the Penguins again  a
month. '

In light of these breakthroughs,

_one cannot help comparing Aguilera

and Lemieux. They are both
Pittsburgh—based stars who have gener-
ated much excitement throughout
Western Pennsylvania and beyond in
their respective areas of expertise.

But that is where their similarities
end. In just about every respect,
I_ernieux is 3,497 times better than
Aguilera.

To start, consider their last names.
“Lemieux” has that hip silent “x” thing
going on and means “the best” en fran-
cais. Aguilera, in contrast, has no cool
surprise silent letters and is probably
Spanish for “big—time wooer.”

But more importantly, think about
what each has done for the city.‘ The
Penguins were a shoddy bunch when
Lemieuxwasdraftedtotheteamin
1984. Heproceededtoleadthe Pensto
back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1991
and 1992, restoring fans’ faith in the
Pittsburgh hockey tradition.

Lemieux was forced to take oif the

1994-1995 season because he suffered
from Hodgkin’s Disease. Instead of
shrinking into obscurity, though, he
became an advocate for cancer
research and an inspiration to many,
recovering in time to win the league
scoring title the next year.

When Lemieux. retired in 1997
because of back problems, the
Penguins were in the death throes of
bankruptcy. He became a hero once
again when he transferred the money
the team owed, him into equity and
became the owner in 1999. Now, with
his impending return to the ice, he
brings the promise of victory to the
Mellon Arena once again.

Aguilera cannot compete with
Lemieux’s legacy and outstanding
character. She has earned her fame not
with hard work and talent, but instead
with tight neon midriﬁ-bearing tops
and cheesy whore-ish lyrics. Of greater
importance is the fact that she has not
given back to the city of Pittsburgh. In
fact, some people are ashamed rather

thartproudthatthescantily cladpop'

star calls Pittsburgh her hometown.
There is no contest. Agrrilera may
sell out the Mellon Arena once a year,
but Lemieux will play before an enthu-
siastic full house 40 times a season.
Lemieux is truly a blessing to the city,
while Aguilera  nothing more than
the under-dressed, overly made—up
real-life version of rocker Barbie.

Pitt sophomore wideout Antonio
Bryant capped a stellar regular season by
winning the Fred Biletnikoff Award yes-
terday in Orlando, Fla.

Bryant received the trophy live on
national television at the ESPN College
Football Awards. Tom Cox, the chair-
man of the Tallahassee Quarterback
Foundation, took to the stage to say the
magic words. A . ‘

“On behalf of the board of trustees
of the Tallahassee Quarterback
Foundation, I’m proud to present this
year’s Biletnikoff Award to Antonio
Bryant, from the University of
Pittsburgh,” Cox said.

As Antonio’s mother Irene Bryant,
along with Pitt head coach Walt Harris,
offensive coordinator J.D. Brookhart
and director of media relations director
E.J. Borghetti stood up to applaud,
Bryant smiled and calmly walked to the
stage to receive the trophy. - A

The look on his face showed the sur-

prise of Bryant, who beat out UCLA’s

Freddie Mitchell and Florida State’s

Brn .........-..

Marvin»“Snoop” Minnis for the award.
“I’m very much surprised,” Bryant

said. “I’m very excited, but this is a real »

shock.” _
Bryant was a freshman at Miami’s

Northwestern ‘High School when Minnis 1

was a senior, and the two grew up in the
same neighborhood.

’ Bryant offered congratulations to
the other two finalists, including his
hometown friend Minnis.

“There are a lot of great athletes out '

there,” he said. “Snoop, man, he’s great.
So is Freddie. This is a great thing. It’s a
great shock right now.”

Bryant can add the Biletnikoff to his
growing list of honors garnered in just
two years at Pitt. Besides being a key in
Pitt’s 7-4 season that resulted in a bid to
the Insight.com Bowl, Bryant was
named tri-Big East Offensive Player of
the Year forhis outstanding performance
this season. '

He led the nation with an average of
130.2 yards per game. Playing only 10
games, he had more total receiving yards
than did Minnis, who played 12 games
for Florida State.

Antonio Bryant led the nation in receiving yards per game this year.

~ Bryant, page 10

Lemieux’s return to ice under the magnifyingiglass

First let me congratulate wide receiver Antonio
Bryant on winning the Biletnikoff Award, which goes
to the best wide receiver in college football.

It is unbelievable what Bryant did in his sophomore"
season. His skill amazes me, his catches are breathtak-
ing and his athletic ability isout of this world.

I look forward to watching Bryant play next year
and taking this football team to an even higher level.

It is nice to see sports stores in the Pittsburgh area
starting to recognize Bryant and sell his soon-to-be-
famous No. 80 jersey. '

On a completely unrelated subject, what’s this I-
hear? Can it really be true? Mario Lemieux is returning
to the ice. No, not just skating around with his Penguin
team, but actually putting on the shoulder pads and the
retired No. 66 jersey and then going out and playing
with the team he owns.

The man simply known as Mario might actually be
playing alongside Jaromir J agr once again.

Now wait a minute. Isn’t Lemieux the owner of the
Pittsburgh Penguins? Of course he is.

He is the reason the Penguins still play in
Pittsburgh. Why would he want to comeback and play?
And can he actually be an owner and a player?

It can’t work, it just can’t. There is no possible way
Lemieux can compete with some of the players today
,— not to mention he is 35 years old and hasn’t played
in a competitive game since 1997. ‘

Can you imagine how out of shape he must be? It

would take him months to even get in shape, and once
he gets in shape, he will have to sign a contract.

Hold on, Lemieux needs a contract to play, but he
would have to. negotiate with himself to get ’

a contract. Is this even allowed? ‘

. In baseball, basketball and football as
far as I know, you can’t be a player and an
owner. .

However, in hockey, Lemieux is technically
allowed to play and would have to for the
league minimum of $250,000. .

If Lemieux actually plays again, this would be
the first time I can recall an owner becoming a
player at the same time.

Magic Johnson wanted to, but was
forced to sell his 2 percent of the Lakers
before becoming a player again.

Let’s just imagine what could possibly Brian Goldman line that shouldn’t be crossed.

happen if owners could become players. I

First off, the Vlfizards, yes the Washington Wizards,
would become NBA champions because Michael
Jordan would be an owner and player for the team.

In football, Daniel Snyder of the Redskins and
Jerry Jones of the Cowboys would be prime targets of
NFL players and would probably suffer more concus-
sions than Troy Aikman did.

In baseball, imagine George Steinbrenner and Peter

  
  
     
   
 

Angelos being players and owners. , «
Not only would bean balls rise, but Frank Robinson

would be fining and suspending Steinbrenner and

Angelos constantly because they would offer money to

easily.

- - So as you can see, it-seems kind of

funny for an owner to be a player as well.

Sports owners are meant to be fat rich people’
who could never play the sport they love so
they end up buying their favorite team.

The players are supposed to be the

The two just don’t mix.

Mario Lemieux should not come back and
play. Not only ishe too old, slow and out of
shape, but Lemieux would be crossing a

It looks bad for the game, and it would
most likely make some Penguin players feel uncom-

fortable about playing with their boss. Lemieux retired e

KENNETH PAUL

Senior Staff Writer

He was recruited by Kentucky,
Syracuse, Connecticut, Kansas and
Georgetown, yet Isaac Hawkins decided
to come to Pitt.

The senior power forward from
Baton Rouge, La., chose Pitt and became
a part of one of the greatest recruiting
classes in the nation. The 1996 class
included Hawkins, Kellii Taylor, Mark
Blount and Vonteego Cummings.

Pitt’s coach at the time, Ralph

Willard, was a former assistant coach at _

Kentucky and used his Southern links to
lure Hawkins. f '

“I knew coach Willard from
[Kentucky head coach] Rick Pitino
because Pitino recruited me,” Hawkins
said.

Hawkins said that coming from the
South to Pittsburgh was quite a transi-
tion.

He noted that assistant coach Bobby
Jones, who is currently the head coach at
St. Francis (Pa.), helped him adjust to the
change in scenery. . ‘

The 6-foot-8, 210-pound forward
saw little playing time during his fresh-
man year.

But Hawkins’ sophomore season

I was a different story. He started all 27

games, averaging 14.2 points and 9.2
rebounds :1 game.

Hawkins was arguably the most
improved player in the Big East during
the 1997-98 season, but it wasn’t until
his junior year that Hawkins started mak-
ing some real noise.

During the 1998-99 season, Pitt was
undefeated in its first six games. The
streak including wins over nationally-

ranked Xavier and Kentucky in the San

Juan Shootout. “

The season looked to be very
promising until a last-second loss to
Connecticut, who eventually went on to

. win the national championship, sent the

season into a downward spiral.

“That year, we were ranked 17th in
the country, but then we had on—the—court
and off—the—court problems,” Hawkins

said. “The media really brought us

down.” ,
The distractions off the court came

. courtesy of Fred Primus who was arrest-
 ed for grand theft.

Although the teamstniggled to a 14-

16 record, Hawkins continued to pros-

per, averaging 12.7 points and 9.0 '

rebounds a game. He ﬁnished in a tie for
second in the Big East with 11 double-
doubles.

The ﬁnal disturbance during the ‘98-
99 seasongcame on Feb. 2, before the St.
John’s game, when the man who had
brought Hawkins to Pitt announced that
he would beresigning at the end of the
season. ‘ I

“When Coach Willard announced
that he was leaving,«it affected me a lot,’’
Hawkins said. “I was thinking about
leaving but after talking it over with fam-
ily and friends, I ﬁgured that staying for
one more year was in my best interest.”

Cturent coach Ben Howland was
hired after Willard ﬁnished his term as a
“lame duck;” ' 

Hawkins said that Howland made i

the transition for the team relatively
painless. “He came in open-minded and
willing to listen,” Hawkins said. “He was
considerate and really clicked with us.”

Unfortunately for Hawkins, he had
no idea what the following season would
have in store for him.

Before the 1999-2000 campaign
even got under way, it was announced
that Hawkins was injured and that he
would sit the year out as a redshirt.»

‘“I’m not sure how it happened,”
Hawkins said. “One day in practice, I
was complaining about my leg hurting.
So I got an MRI and found out that it was
fracn1red.”

Hawkins said that he thought the
injury might have occurred while play-
ing in an outdoor summer league. Like
any other competitor, Hawkins was upset
about the prospect of sitting out for an
entire season.

“It affected me a lot, however, I
think it helped me more than hurt me, in
the long run,” he said. '

Misfortune continued to follow
Hawkins around last season, when he
was arrested for possession of marijuana
on Feb. 6.

The rebounding guru continued the
trend of discipline problems within the
basketball program and’ was under
relentless scrutiny from the press.

However, Hawkins was not phased,
as he said that the media pressure did not

‘weigh him down. ,
“It was just circumstances that could ’

have happened to anyone,” he said.
Hawkins said that Howland was

helpful inthe matter.

“He was very ‘supportive and he
knew the real situation, which differed
from what the media knew,” he said.
“He’s the real reason that I’m at Pitt right
now.”

Hawkins said that he has put the
problems of last year behind him. ,

In his first game in more than a year,
Hawkins ‘scored six points and pulled
down 11 rebounds vs. North Carolina
A&T State. ‘

“I was really excited, probably too
excited,” he said. “I’m still too anxious
to go into games right now.”

Hawkins has shown that he is on his
way back, as he put up double—doubles
against Morris Brown and Nebraska. On
Wednesday, he scored a season—high 14
points in a loss to Penn State.

Hawkins, along with Ricardo Greer,
are the only two starting seniors this sea-
son. With eight new faces on the team,
Hawkins said that he likes being a leader.

“They’re looking up to Ricardo and
myself as leaders because »we’ve' been
here the longest,” he said, “but that’s not
that new because my junior year, I was a
leader with Vonteego.”

Hawkins and his teammates squared ~

off against his former mentor, Jones, and

-~ St. Francis on Nov. 29 and came away

with a 70_-52 win.‘

Hawkins said that he’d like to ﬁnish
his senior season with a berth to the
NCAA toumament. , .

“Obviously, to make the NCAA
tournament is a goal of every team. I just
want to go out and give 100 percent
every night and do whatever I can do to
help the team,” Hawkins said.

Hawkins, a communications major, '
said that a year from now, he will still be V

playing basketball. ' V
Whether he’s playing in the NBA or
with former teammate Jarrett Lockhart in

the Continental Basketball Association,

only time will tell.

After leading his high school to the
state championship in Florida’s highest
classiﬁcation (6A), Bryant waited for
scholarship offers from the Florida uni-

his attention to Pitt, where a previously
committed recruit backed out and freed
up the Panthers’ 25th and final scholar-
