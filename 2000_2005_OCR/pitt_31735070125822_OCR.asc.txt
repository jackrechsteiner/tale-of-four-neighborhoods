Rostructig the twin towers

« Members of Pitt’s Gay/Straight Alliance sell pieces of a picture of the World Trade
Center to be reconstructed in Towers lobby. Proceeds benefit the United Way.

MELISSA MEINZERA
The Pitt News

The twin towers of the World

’ Trade Center are being rebuilt, block

by block, on the back wall of Towers
lobby at Pitt.

After the Sept. 11 attacks deci-
mated the World Trade Center,
members of Pitt’s Gay/Straight
Alliance immediately knew they
wanted to “do something unique and
different from everyone else,” said
GSA president Josh Stewart.

.GSA members decided. to sell
out up pieces of a l0—foot—tall photo

of the twin towers to symbolically-

reconstruct them. Each of the 480
blocks sells for $1 apiece, and buy-
ers can write messages on the back.
A1l"the "money collected goes to the

United Way’s September 11th Fund.

Originally, members of GSA
wanted to build the tower out of
construction paper but that proved
too time consuming. Instead, the
blocks are pieces of a blown-up

photo. After students and staff .pur-
chase the blocks, they are stuck with
masking tape to four large pieces of
yellow posterboard hanging on the
wall. ’

GSA members knew they had to
act fast in order for their project to
be topical. They conveyed -this
urgency to the Office of Residence
Life and received’ the necessary
approval the day after they applied.

Kinko’s granted GSA a discount
on the printing and resizing job and
donated one of the four large panels
of posterboard. It took less. than a
week for Student Government Board
to approve covering the rest of the
cost. Without anyoverhead, all the
money from sales and donations can
go directly to the United Way.

GSA has a table in Towers lobby
staffed by a rotating group of four
members, including at least one offi-
cer at all times. “In between classes
and work, we’re here,” Stewart said.

Police install new crosswalk markers on Bigelow

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

Tim Delaney got a call from the city police a few weeks
ago. _
The call was ﬁom Dom Costa, commander of the city’s
Zone 6 police station, and hehad a request.
Costa called Delaney —- Pitt’s interim chief of police
— to tell him about a new pilot program the Pemrsylvania
Department of—Transportation is instituting across the state.
The program,‘ aimed at decreasing the number of pedestri-
an accidents statewide, places brightly colored markers 50
feet before high—trafﬁc crosswalks. ’
Costa requested that Pitt install these markers.

Two of the markers, which remind motorists to stop for 

pedestrian traffic in a crosswalk, were installed on Bigelow

Boulevard infront of the Cathedral of Learning yesterday 5

afternoon.
As Pitt police, city police and PennDOT ofﬁcials talked
R with students and members of the media at the initiative’s
unveiling yesterday, the swarms of students and hundreds of
‘cars afﬁnned the reason for the markers’ placement.
_ “This is the ﬁrstcrosswalk that came to my mind when
A I heard about the program,” Costa said,‘addjng that he con-
siders the area the busiest place in Oakland. “This is per-
fect.” A

Costa said he hopes ﬂ1e 40-pound portable markers will
encourage motorists to comply with crosswalk laws.

Ifthe signs aren’t enough of a deterrent, ﬁnes likely will
be. .

“You have to follow this kind of thing up with strict
enforcement,” Costa said, mentioning that failure to yield to
a pedestrian in a crosswalk brings with it $94.50 in ﬁnes and
costs. ' ~

According to Catherine Tress, A safety press officer for
PennDOT, the initiative was designed to reduce the number
of pedestrian injuries and deaths. Tress said thafsince 1996,

. Allegheny County has seen 3,000 pedestrian crashes result-

ing in 80 deaths. . . V

Tress said the markers comply with all state and feder-
al regulations, and will be in place semi—perrnanently at
locations across. the city and state. ' .

Delaney said oﬂicers will likely remove the markers
every night, and’ place them back on the street each mom-
ing before rush hour. But he doesn’t want the markers’ pres-
ence on Pitt’s campus to be limited to Bigelow Boulevard.

‘The people ﬂying through there in the morning going
to work don’t really careiabout Oakland, or don’t pay atten-
tion to it,” he said, adding that he hopes to secure markers
to place on Forbes and Fifth avenues near Bigelow
Boulevard. .

Sophomore Kat:ie'Welsh said she’s never had too much

   
   

of a problem crossing Bigelow Boulevard, but added that
she hopes the new signs will help to alleviate problems cre-
ated by impatient drivers.

“Some days it’s not too bad,” Welsh said, “but there are
times when a lot of people are coming by and they try to
inch their way through.” , A

“Hopefully, ﬂie signs will alert people that pedestrians
do have the right of way,”—she said. ‘

committee

navigates strict manual

ERIN BRACHLOW
Staff Writer

Amid the slow formation of its 10
sister student government committees,
the allocations committee continues
working. The only committee that has

. sustained its December to December

term, allocations budgets money to
more than 200 student organizations
while trying to keep the process fair.

The committee’s work began in
January, when each student group pre-
pared its annual budget with the help of
a committee liaison. Based on the
group’s goals for the upcoming year, its
members requested a certain amount of
money for each plarmed activity. With a
total of $700,000 and a strict set of
rules, senior allocations chair Jen
Kolenda decided how the sum would be
divided among student groups.

Out of the $700,000, the Office of

Student Activities gives _her target‘

amounts for approvals, denials and
deferrals in order to make room for later
requests. "

“We try to approve and deny a cer-
tain amount of money in January,”
Kolenda said. “Then groups that didn’t
take part in the budget process can have
a chance also.”

The solution for late groups is to
make supplemental requests each Week

to the committee. Any other_group can

also add onto its budget this way at any
time. The committee then meets and
recommends to Student Government
Board its approvals and denials, based
on issues like viability, need, impact
and cost.

Kolenda’s committee lives by its
manual, in which the rules for each spe-

ciﬁc request are outlined. The manual.

mandates that some activities carmot be
funded, including religiousiretreats, the
purchase of alcohol, administrative sup-
plies and off-campus facility rentals.

Also, except for the 10 governance
groups on campus, allocations can only
fund $600 per year per group for one
conference if only one person attends.
These rules, and many others, keep the
committee on a restricted agenda every
week. ~

“We only serve as a committee that
makes recommendations to the board
based on our manual,” Kolenda said.
“The board then has the ability to break
the rules if they want to disagree with
us.” ~
At the Sept. 24 meeting, SGB
approved a $3,000 request from the
roller hockey league for its dues, going
against allocations’ recommendation,
which was based on a rule that states,
“funding directly related to competition
is prohibited.” -

After a member of ‘the hockey.
league argued that his group received
this money last year and that it was
needed to keep the group going, board
member Lonnie Fish‘ argued to give
them the money.

The Society of Automotive
Engineers, a group that builds a race car
for a design competition, also ran into a
problem with the _committee after its
annual budget was cut by‘ more than
$12,600. Money was approved for safe-

-ty and tools, but the allocations commit-

tee gave no reason for denying the rest.
“I was shocked to. see that we
received no money for the materials
needed, to actually build the car,” said’
sophomore Joe Berger, SAE secretary.
“Most of last year’s parts can’t, be
reused  wom-out racing parts coul
break and are unsafe.” <
SAE is currently working on sub-
mitting a supplemental request to try to
get the money approved.

tion to follow speciﬁc regulations, the

Professor extolls virtues of mentoring

EMILY SCHMITZ
The Pitt News

Dr. Mary Iou Soﬁa said her position as

' a mentor is the reason she remains at the

University.

“I think mentoring is one of the most
rewarding things we can do as faculty,” said
Soﬁa, a professor in Pitt’s computer science
department.

Soﬁa presented her thoughts on mentor-
ing Monday at the armual Fall Reception
Honoring Women Faculty, presented by the
Provost’s Advisory Committee on Women’s
Concerns in conjunction with the wornen’s
studies department.

Her presentation, titled “Mentoring:
Opening Doors,” focused mainly on female
mentoring among members of _Pitt’s faculty.

Soﬁa deﬁned mentoring as establishing
and developing a special relationship that is
both personal. and professional that lasts a
period of time.

The mentor provides information, help,
advice, contacts, advocacy, encouragement
and support to the student throughout the
course of the relationship.

“I never thought of myself as a mentor.
I didn’t know exactly what it was, but [after
my ﬁrst mentoring experience], I knew it felt
good,” Soﬁa said.

‘ She said that a need for female mentors
within Pitt’s faculty exists because male fac-
ulty members establish informal mentoring

practices with one another that female facul-
ty do not.

Citing statistics indicating the lack of
female representation in the science depart-
ments at the University, Soﬁa detailed the
life cycle of a Pitt professor, saying that
female faculty need to be exposed to the
same avenues to advance their careers as
male faculty are.

Soﬁa called for the University depart-
ments to set up formal mentoring programs,
especially in ﬁelds that lack strong female
representation. .

The programs would provide women in
the department with the personal role mod-
els, support and conﬁdence that Soﬁa said
are currently lacking. '

V “One of the things that women don’t do
enough of is promote themselves,” Soﬁa
said “We need to correct that.”

. Soffa, a recipient of the 1999
Presidential "Award for Excellence in
Science, - Mathematics and Engineering
Mentoring, identiﬁes with ' a group of
women in the computer science ﬁeld across
the nation. The women work as mentors for

, one another through e-mail.

Soﬁa’s comments were met by nods of
approval and ripples of laughter from the
nearly all-female audience.

Audience members commented on
everything from the male faculty not being
openly sexist — rather, being ‘unconscious

. of the situation” —‘ to fears that formal men-

  

 

RAVELI
3oo.777.o1 12

toring programs are too artiﬁcial and lack the
natural ﬂow of a spontaneous relationship.
Soﬁa responded by clarifying that “not
all mentoring relationships work out, but at
least it provides someone to talk to.’_’ '

Art history professor Kathy Linduﬁ said
that she couldn’t agree more.

“I feel that [formal mentoring pro-
grams] are absolutely essential for the suc-

‘cess of women at the University,” Linduﬁ
said.

- Linduﬁwentontosaythatthelackof
mentoring programs is often" overlooked
because the concept is relatively unknown to
many people. 

Though Soﬁa’s primary concem was
woman-to—woman mentoring within faculty,
she also  concerns about the lack of
mentoring for female students at the
University as a whole. ‘

She advised faculty members to seek
out talented and interested students in their
classes, and invite them to join research
teams or to attend ofﬁce hours so they can
begin to establish relationships.

Soﬁa said she knows that the relation-
ship can go both ways, but realizes that
many ‘ students don’t feel comfortable
approaching professors.

“[Students don’t realize that] the rnajor—
ity of faculty wants to interact with students
and welcome interest in their ﬁelds,” Soﬁa
said. “Either way, mentoring is all about
reaching out.” ’

committee urges groups requesting
money to discuss their requests at its
weekly meetings so that the committee
can better understand where the money
is going. ’ q

“We encourage groups to come to
us at meetings and explain their
requests,” Kolenda said.

To provide students with another
chance to give feedback, allocations
distributed a survey last year in which
each group could describe what it liked

' about the annual budget process and

what it wanted to see changed.

According to Kolenda, many orga-
nizations were unhappy with the regu-
lations. In response, she will present
some new suggestions to three of the
board members to collectively revise
the allocations manual.

“We wanted to make the manual

read sometimes.” _

PERSPECTIVES

EDITORIAL

Tired of playing Bigelow
Boulevard Fro g ger    

When not attempting to dodge traf-
ﬁc on Bigelow Boulevard in front of the
Cathedral of Learning yesterday, you
may have noticed new traffic signs
instructing drivers to yield to pedestrians
at crosswalks. . ,

The signs, part of a state program to
reduce the number of pedestrian deaths
and accidents, will be a ﬁxture on
Bigelow from now on to encourage
motorists to comply with trafﬁc laws and
yield to pedestrians.

While the signs are a good addition,
they are portable. People could easily
steal them, and many may try. We’re on
a college campus — just think of all the
people who would want these as living
room decorations.

To make them more effective, they
should be made more permanent — keep-
ing the same visibility they have now.

Ten minutes before every hour dur-
ing the school day, Bigelow becomes
congested as we try to change classes.
Often drivers ﬁnd themselves at a stand-
still while we play a game of Bigelow
Boulevard Frogger.

While permanent signs would help
alleviate this problem, pedestrians can
also use common courtesy to help elirni—
nate the traffic congestion.

Although dodging traffic may be
quicker, we should resist the temptation
to cross Bigelow anywhere except at the

three designated crosswalks. We are ‘

already lucky that Bigelow has a cross-
walk in the middle of it, not just on the
corners. We should take advantage of
that, both for our own safety and as a
courtesy to the many commuters forced
to drive through Oakland every day.

We should also resist the temptation
to cross the street when the traffic on
Bigelow has a green light. Although we
still technically have the right of way,
trafﬁc will be so backed up — and drivers
will not be as agitated and thus less sus-
ceptible to their urges to run us over
when we cross in front of them.

Pedestrians are not the only ones to
blame for traffic problems on Bigelow.
Drivers need to realize that they are dri-
ving through an urban campus and
should have more patience with students
crossing the street. They should also be
more cautious and’ realize that pedestri-
ans will always be there, especially dur-
ing times between classes.

We hopethat more permanent signs,
combined with more courtesy on the part
of both drivers and pedestrians, will

_ improve the situation on Bigelow.

DAVID J. MCCARTHY
The Pitt News

‘ Like the “ﬁnding-a—$20-in—your-jeans-
pocket-while—doing-the-wash—effect,” good
things occasionally come out of nowhere.

I ' Sense Fie1d’s new album, Tonight and
Forever, is, that random $20 found in the
wrinkled jeans pockets that are endless
record store shelves.

Tonight and Forever’s most striking
feature is its mellow authoritativeness. Each
song sounds timid in volume but roaring in
message. It’s like your grandfather speaking;
he doesn’t need to raise his voice to let you
know what he’s saying is important.

J The best thing about Sense Field’s
songs are that they avoid mass-produced
pop nothingness. The songs contain — ﬂ1is

». may be a shock ———meanings. The standout

example is “Save Yourself.” This song clear-
ly blasphemes rock ‘n’ roll by preaching
about actually waiting for a reason to have
sex. Somewhere, the members of Poison are
crying-

Perhaps the inspiration for such lyrics
came from ﬂue band’s apparent Beatles
inﬂuence. “Beaﬂes Song” and “Weight of
the Worl ” are evidence of the band’s appre-

ciation for the Fab Four. “Beatles Song” tells _

the story of the intimacy and personiﬁcation
of a girl’s favorite music. “Weight of the
World” feels like it was cut from the same

cloth as John Lennon’s “Beautiful Boy.”*

These songs serve as evidence that if you
want to build something strong, start with a

i good foundation.

The album’s real power comes from the
fact that each song complements the next.
The ﬂow of the music mimics waves gliding
over a beach. It casts a peaceful, easy feeling
over the listener.

T The record hit stores Sept. 25, but you A

probably won’t catch any of their songs on

the radio. This is because their label,

Network America, is.not a major force in the
industry. Fortunately, you can hear some
tracks on UPN’s Roswell. The Oct. 9
episode will feature “Here Right Here.”

Musicians haven’t just competed
for Billboard ratings over the last
years; they have competed for spots
on the best seller’s list —— Jewel
spilled her guts in a poetry book,
Marilyn Manson’s auto-
biography expounded on
his grandfather’s porn
fetish and Motley Crue’s
memoirs detailed every
sexual act performed backstage.

While it might be embarrassing to
admit devouring every detail of ful-
filled sexualifantasy in these books,
the truth is they sold just as well as
magazines running PG-coverage of

-the artists’ lives_. .

One thing that emerged from the
books and articles is the dirt that
goes on behind the scenes. There is
never a look into the lives of A&R
— artists’ and repertoire. These
people are the ones who found
your favorite artists and made

them worth reading about.

Bill Flanagan’s first novel,
“A&R,” proves that these people’s
lives are just as interesting as any-
thing that goes on ‘in the back of a
band bus. With Flanagan’s VH1 cre-
dentials including shows such as
“Storytellers” and “Legends,”
readers could surmise
that this book isn’t
completely fic-
tional.

Jim’s transition to corporate_life

nouveau riche attitude. Jim even
begins to doubt his own ear for talent

at his new band proposals.

While Jim strugglesto

_ pany, he begins to piece

together a plan to overthrow the cur-

rent CEO. The results ultimately dam-

age the company’s reputation, leave

the media speculating over the death

of Jerusalem’s singer and popularize
black-lesbian folk music.

“A&R” answers every question
you’ve ever had about the music
industry: why certain bands make it
and why others never get a second

truly holds power in the music
industry, and why executives

Nouveau riche

Viva Nueva
Rustic Overtones
Tommy Boy Music
7L‘r7,‘i'7,“r‘2i‘r

Put funk, ska, punk, hip-hop and rock
into a blender, and you get something close
to the Rustic Overtones.

After a long battle between record
companies, the band’s major label debut,
Viva Nueva, has ﬁnally been released, much
to the relief of their devoted fans. VV1th an
effort as strong as I/zva Nueva, those fans
will not be disappointed.

If you want to compare them to a band
today, you’d have some trouble because
their sound is so unique. Some tracks are
reminiscent of G Love and Special Sauce,
Sublime ‘(especially on “Revolutionary
AM’) and 2 Skinnee J’s.

The album is a fantastic blend of front-
man Dave Gutter’s gritty, punk-inspired
lyrics, while the Overtones blast out the
tight combination of a funky horn and organ
section, hip-hop beats and rock chords.

David Bowie guest stars on “Sector Z”
and Funk Master Flex lends a skillful hand
with “Smoke.”

Each track on the album is decent, but
there are some clear highlights. The open-
ing track, “C’mon,” is a get—up track that
has serious potential to break into main-
streamroclg

 

Imogen Heap on backing Vocals, is a
lighter, soulful track. The track
“Combustible” shows that the band can just
straight out rock. Hip—hop heavily inﬂu-
enced “Love Underground” and “Smoke.”
Everything falls right into place with
every track. The Rustic Overtones master
the complicated formula of getting all the

‘ different sounds together.

Throughout the album they show why
they are on the cutting edge of the college
music scene.

Rustic Overtones perform a grueling
200 shows a year on the college/club cir-
cuit, which has brought them their loyal fan
base. Keep an eye out for the next time they
come to town. '

If you want to get in on the secret that
a lot of die—hard fans have known for a
while, pick up Viva Nueva. Rustic
Overtones is a great band and they really
show it on this album, which is one of the
year’s best.

Knut

Hydra Head Records
72:12:

In a music world where almost every-
thing that reaches the public surface has been
bought out, manipulated or duped to meet
“ ublic satisfaction,” the four-piece outﬁt

Knut is a proud proponent of an under-.

ground sound that lacks any commercial
inﬂuence.

Knutisabandthatisnotafraidtohave
a do-it-yourself attitude in the wake of the
current major label success of heavier acts
throughout the world. The band’s roots stem
from the snow-covered city in the mists of
the Swiss Alps and the Jura Mountains,
Geneva, Switzerland It is here where the
band’s ferocious live shows quickly built a
cult following ﬁ'om the underground music
fans.

The four members: Didier (vocals),

Phillipe (guitars), Thieny (bass) and Roderic -

(drums), aside from independently record-

ing their own seven-inch vinyls in their base-‘
ments and eventually starting their own indie

label, “Snuff Records,” helped shape a local

music scene by providing a label by which

local arti_sts could effectively get ﬂieir music

to their fans.

Their debut release, Bastardiser, on
Hydra Head Records, is an album that mixes
several underground inﬂuences. The band
uses elements of doom, death, hard-core,
noise and thrash metal throughout the
album. The music is set around dropped

V tuned guitars for an extreme crunch, which

is set over a particularly low bass end.

The music reﬂects much of the under-
ground doom/death metal scene with long
intros that repeat crunching after crunching
riﬁ‘. Add a drummer who accentuates the
sound’s choppiness and a vocalist who
refuses to leave the one-dimensional
scream/gurgle onslaught, and you have
Bastardiser. ’

A conditioned listener to Lmderground
hard-core/death metal may ﬁnd this album
more enjoyable than the common listener.
The band presents some interesting shifts
and timing techniques. But even this type of
listening approach may prove to be in vain,
because upon close examination, the multi-
ple time shifts and beat conﬁgurations
remain fairly simplistic, with only scattered
instances of truly unique innovation.

In a time when acts such as Mudvayne
are rewriting the formula to standard song
creation and timing, bands like Knut may
ﬁnd it hard to reach fans anywhere outside of
a cult following. Too bad the music of such
an inspired group of individuals is only ﬁt for
the underground listening realm.

The Fighting Irish showed the

who quickly sent it to the top right

to give the Irish a 1-0 lead.

But Notre Dame didn’t stop

Boland also got a yellow card for
the Irish at the 44-minute mark.

“We just weren’t aggressive
enough in the first half,” Pitt head

The Panthers men’s soccer team did a good job
offensively and physically to end a five—game los-
ing streak.

Pitt (2—6-0) beat St. Bonaventure (5-3-0) 3-0 on
Sunday, led by Bryan Hopper. Hopper, a junior
midfielder from local East Allegheny high school
in North Versailles, scored two goals for the
Panthers. ' -

Complimenting the offensive effort was the
defense, who stiﬂed the St. Bonaventure offense.
The defense allowed only eight shots. Goalkeeper
Joe Conlan registered a shutout in his first start of
the season for the Panthers.

In the first half, the Panthers offense pressured
St. Bonaventure asltheyntallied their first goal 25
minutes, 52 seconds into the game. Hopper inter-
cepted a bad pass from a Bonnie defender and
lobbed it over goalkeeper Mike Krupka to put the
Panthers on the board.

serious injury to Lemieux,
and this team is done.

So those are the things
to worry about, but what’s
to love about the bits and
pieces of the team that
made it to the Eastern
Conference ﬁnals last year?

‘ Hedberg, a goalie who
came out of nowhere to

day soon. But for the present

V . time, I’ll make a bold prediction that the

Penguins will once again be a multi-
rotmd playoff team this year.

‘ Maybe that’s not too bold a state-
ment, but you’ve got to think that when
a team is forced to give up arguably the
best player in the world, Jaromir Jagr,
there is going to be a drop-off.

On top of that, the Pens have Johan
Hedberg, a goalie who hasn’t completely
proven himself yet. Other elite teams in
the league have retooled their lineups
and added big-tirne players, while the
Pens’ nucleus, sans Jagr, remains the
same. , .

I don’t want to bash Mario Lemieux

usurp puck-stopping prodi-
gy Jean-Sebastian Aubin and journey-
man Garth Snow, is back. Hedberg only
played in a handful of regular season
games and was magical in the playoffs.
If his level of play carries over to this
season, it’s great to think the Pens will
have some defense to go along with their
offense for once. The Pens will probably
produce fewer goals this season, so “the
Moose” is just as vital to this team as
Lemieux. ' '
Secondly, they don’t have J agr.
J agr’s world-class in skating and world-
class in whining. Three times he asked to
be traded last year, and that had to cause

distractions for the team, but not any-

during the season to stay competitive.’

more. The Pens’ heads have to be clearer
now with no more whining from No. 68.
What the Pens got in return for Jagr
appears to be quickly coming together.
Left winger Kris Beech, the 20-year-
old prize, is scheduled to be on the ﬁrst
line with Lemieux when the Pens host
defending champion Colorado to open
the season tonight. - '

Beech will be counted on heavily for ’

goals. and for getting the puck" to
Lemieux. That’s a lot to ask of a player
with only four games of NHL experi-*
ence, but if he made it onto the —starting
line ahead of Jan Hrdina ’ or Martin
Straka before. the first regular season
puck even dropped, that’s saying some-
thing.
And lastly, there’s Lemieux. He’s a
one-man show now, and I think he’ll rel-
ish it. There has to be an added ﬁre in
him now that Jagr is gone, and to think
that his point production is likely to go
up this year is scary.

Kordell still has plenty of time to
ﬁgure out how to hit an open Hines Ward
and get the Steelers back to the playoffs,
but the pessimistic fan’s clock is ticking.

The Penguins are coming.

Agredano nets game—winner in double overtime

Split, page 10

in for the score.
When it was all said and done,

'- Pitt goalkeeper Rachel Brown faced

15 shots and made four saves. Her
counterparts for the Fighting Irish,
Elizabeth Wagner and substitute
Lauren Kent, only faced four shots
with Kent making two saves.
Lauren Sciocchetti, Annette
Agredano and Jacqueline Fix had a
shot apiece in the Panthers effort.

Pitt 1, Seton Hall 0 (2OT)
There were some heavy Western

 
  
 

Norton

inﬂuences in Pitt’s second game of

‘the weekend as Agredano from

Tucson, Ariz., Cande Ruiz-
Bradbury from Oxnard, Calif., and
Katrina Shibata from Lakewood,
Calif., hooked up to give the
Panthers a much needed conference
win.
At the 7:15 mark of the second
overtime, Agredano got a pass from
Ruiz-Bradbury and Shibata before
kicking in the game-winner past
Pirate goalkeeper Heather Hinton.
The Panthers outshot Seton Hall
12-4 in the first half as Hinton put
up a valiant performance turning

away all of Pitt’s shots. She fin-
ished the day with five saves.

The Pirates came charging back
in the second half outshooting Pitt
5-4, but when regulation time
expired, the score was still knotted
at zero. '

The first overtime went to Seton
Hall as they outshot Pitt 2-0, but the
Panthers got two attempts off in the
second overtime, including the
Agredano’s game-winner. The
Panthers outshot the Pirates 19-12
overall.

Brown had five saves in her sec-
ond shutout in four games. Ruiz-
