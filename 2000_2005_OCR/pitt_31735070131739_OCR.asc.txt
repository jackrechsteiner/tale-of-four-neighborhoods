debate elections,
personal opinions

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

What should be the standards for sarne—sex adoption?
How do you feel about the election of judges? What is the
role of prisons in our society? '

These were just some of the questions asked by a stu-
dent panel at a debate between the two candidates for the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court, held last Thursday night in
the Teplitz Moot, Courtroom, located inside Pitt’s Law
School Building. _

Candidates Judge Joan Orie Melvin, the republican
nominee, and Judge Max Baer, the democratic nominee,
participated in the debate.

' Melvin has served on the Court of Common Pleas for
Allegheny County, as well as a magistrate for the City of
Pittsburgh and as a judgefor the Pennsylvania Superior
Court. ' - '

Baer has served as Deputy Attorney General, as well
as in the juvenile, family, and civil divisions of the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.

Hosted by the Pennsylvania League of Women Voters
and organized by both state and local members, the debate
was one of a series of non-partisan events designed to
increase voter knowledge about the candidates.

“We were thrilled to do this,” said Carol Emerson,
vice president of voter service for the League of Women
Voters of Greater Pittsburgh. ‘ .

V “We knew that this was an important race,” she added.

Apanel of law students each asked one question of the
candidates. These questions alternated with questions ﬁom
the moderator, John Burkoff, the associate dean of acade-
mic affairs in Pitt’s law school.

The subjects discussed ranged from the candidates’
role models to the role of the judiciary system in the pub-
lic sphere. V «

A major theme throughout the debate focused on ,

whether it was proper for a judge to express personal
views in public, or whether judges should remain silent on
certain issues to better serve those who expect a complete-
ly impartial courtroom.

Baer said the public has a right to know about the
views of the judge they are electing, while Melvin felt that
judges should not state their views on certain issues, in
order to remain impartial.

Students get tips to make it through winter

DAVID TKACIK
Staff Writer

On a warm Indian summer day,
when bumblebees and ladybugs were
a common sight on campus, an infor-

~mationa1 session about surviving

winter in Pittsburgh seemed out of
place.

a But some Pitt students didn’t let
the fair weather fool them into not
being prepared for the ruggedness of
winter.

A handful of students turned out
for “Surviving the Winter in
Pittsburgh,” hosted by the Office of

International Services Friday after-
noon in the William Pitt Union, to
learn a few tricks about coping with
cold.

Jamie B. Rayman, International
Programming Coordinator, led the
presentation, which was designed for
students from tropical climates but
was open for anyone to attend.

Rayman, a native Pennsylvanian,
said that many international students
come to Pittsburgh without having
ever seen snow, and that theclimate
change can be quite a shock.

The presentation featured tips on

how to conserve energy, treat frost-

bite and hypothenniia, dress‘ for}opti-

mal warmth and have fun during the p .

wintry months. A
One way to tell if fa-‘window ‘has a

a lit match next to it and watch for
ﬂickering.

If your window has a draft, one
quick fix it is to use a window insula-
tion kit, which is a large sheet of
clear plastic that shrinks and tightens
around your window frame.

Another way to save money on
heating, according to Rayman, is to
turn down your heat when you leave
home and turn it back up when you

draft, according to Rayman, is to hold

long time, because water pipes can
freeze and even crack. '

For those living on-campus,
problems tend to spring from having
too much heat, instead of not enough.

Unfortunately, Rayman said, stu-
dents can’t always control the heat in
the University dorms. When the heat
is set too high, people open windows
to let in cool air, despite the fact that
they are essentially wasting heat
energy. ' --
For students seeking a bit of fun i

‘ winter weather, Rayman suggested

ice skating at either Schenley Park or
the relatively new rink at PPG Place.

Freshman Alexandra Jefferds, an
engineering major from‘,/Berkeley,
Calif., attended the lecture and pre-
sentation. She said she" had recently
purchased snow’ tires for her wheel-
chair and wanted to know if the local
rinks would allow wheelchairs on the
ice. / 1

According to one representative
at Schenley Skating Rink, the current
policy allows people in wheelchairs
on the ice only if «theentire rink is
rented for _a party.

The skating rink at .PP_G \Place
was unavailable for comment about
wheelchair access.

Listing more fun things to do in
winter weather, Rayman also recom-
mended appreciating ' the intricacies
of the crystalline ‘pattern of

snowﬂakes, making snowmen, sled

riding on cafeteria trays and-, of

~ course, throwing snowballs.

Jayashree Mohanty, a School of
Social Work;__ graduate student "from
the state of Orissa in India — where
the average temperature in winter is

68 degrees Fahrenheit —— said that .

she was eager to get involved in win-
tertime activities. ‘

“I’m looking forward to throwing
my first snowball,” she said.

Split in Church necessary, traditional

Rev. Canon V. Gene Robinson
was consecrated as bishop of the
Episcopal Diocese ‘of New
Hampshire on Nov. 2, an event that
threatens to split the Episcopal
Church. '

Robinson is openly gay — in
fact, he’s the first openly gay bish-
op the Church has elected. And his
election faced opposition from the
more conservative factions of the
Church, championed by the

‘ Pittsburgh Diocese’s Bishop Robert

Duncan, who may leave the Church
altogether.

Despite the controversial nature
of this issue, both sides seem to be
remaining peaceful. Gone are the
hellfire and brimstone that can
accompany disagreements about
gay people’s roles in religion.
Absent are the sulfurous accusa-
tions, and, if any Bibles are being
thumped, the people thumping them
are doing so quietly, and with con-
sideration of those nearby. '

Even Duncan, who wrote, in an
e-mail to Robinson, “I can’t rejoice
in your election  I can promise I
will pray for you every day,”
according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, seems free of malice, if not
of smug moralizing. All in all,
everyone seems to be accepting that
a change is going to occur.

Robinson, for his part, is doing
something brave. He has probably

I

received many -letters nowhere near
as temperate as Duncan’s, and his
choice to do something remarkable
should be commended, no matter
what your stand on the issue is.

But things seem, on the whole,
civil. .
Indeed, according to the trea-
surer of one church in Rochester,
N.H., during the consecration,
those opposed to Robinson’s elec-
tion were ableto Voice their protes-
tations, after which they left, to go
“quietly down the road to [their]
own worship servicef.’ '

And isn’t that what religious
sects should do? When confronted
with a major issue — divorce or gay
people’s roles — they should split.
The Anglican Church, which
spawned the Episcopal one, was
formed through such a schism —-

when the Church of England
divorced itself from the Roman
Catholic Church over, ~well,
divorce.

And the tradition continues.

Religion is about faith and
belief, and about following who or
what you have faith in and what you
‘believe.

If people oppose Robinson, and
cannot support a faith that does,
rather than having bloodshed and

shouting matches, they should sim-

ply and quietly exit. _
And they are.

no reason he needs to know speciﬁcs.

you have to tell him. However, there is no

real reason for him to make such a demand,

you over the revelation of your magic num-
ber, it was never meant to be. You say he has-

going to marry l'llI1'l — yet you
don’t mention that until the end

You aren’t one to keep boyfriends, and you

are contemplating willfully lying to some- -

one you claim to love and want to many. He
has nearly unreasonable standards, and likes
knowing you are in fear of telling him you
don’t meet them. He sounds pretty manipu-
lative, and sounds like he likes playing head
games. What’s his magic number? Have you
asked? Is it, oh, let me see, four? Because if
that’s the case, what he can’t stand is the
notion of you being more experienced and
worldly than him, which is sort of sad and
wrongheadedly competitive.

Getting the caffeine monkey off my back, one breakdown at a time

After about two months of rehabilitation, it
feels good to finally come clean. I had an addic-
tion — not something I’m very proud of, but
nonetheless I accepted the truth.

You see for most of my life, I struggled with
a dependency on Coke.

Whoa, not that kind of coke, Mr.
Downey. I’m talking about Coca-

of all drugs — caffeine.

Caffeine is the scourge of society, .
the real public enemy number one that
is destroying today’s youth.

But no longer will this dangerous
narcotic infect my system, for I have
officially quit the drug —— for a little
while anyway.

‘Quitting caffeine was not an easy
or pleasant thing to do. «

The first weekend I decided to avoid the drug ,

looked a lot like the opening scene of
“Apocalypse Now.”

Music from The Doors blasted from my
stereo while I stripped down to ‘my underwear,
did some funky martial arts moves, busted a mir-
ror with my fists and smeared the resulting, deli-
cious blood all over my grinning, disillusioned
face. I

Well, maybe it didn’t happen quite like that.
Actually Ijust slept a lot —— a whole lot. But in
the end, I think I’m a better person because of
my decision. _

So what exactly made me decide to kick the
habit? Did I have a death wish? Am I really as
deranged as I look? Did I suffer from some sort

’ sion,

of head trauma?

In a way, yes.

I frequently suffer from torturous headaches.
Note that when I say “frequently” I mean every
freaking day at about three o’clock in the after-

noon. Every so often these headaches
‘ will get a bit wacky and turn into
something fun called a migraine.

If you have ever wondered what
Curly felt like whenever Moe crushed
his skull in a vice grip, you should try
getting a migraine headache.

After doing a little research into
the subject, I discovered that my ail-
ments might be caused by dietary ele-
ments. ‘

If I wanted to be rid of the
headaches, I would have to cut down
on processed ‘meats, cheese, and, of

course, caffeine —— so much for my patented
bologna, Cheez Whiz and Excedrin Extra
Strength sandwiches.’

Naturally, myfirst inclination was to con-
struct a makeshift gallows and learn to tie a stur-
dy noose, but then I thought perhaps a change in
lifestyle could be good for me.

If I cut out the caffeine, I would feel less ten-
nervousness, , jitteriness and nausea.
Ironically, during those first few drug-free days,
my teeth were clenched tight enough to crack
walnuts, my nerves were shot, my hands were
shaking like two coin-operated mattresses and
my stomach felt like a haggis platter. _

There was also a curious combination of
insomnia and narcolepsy, which I am not too

sure how to describe, but I think it would be sim-
ilar to having your brain replaced with a mixture
of sour cream and rusty nails. ' _

But after that initial shock, I felt a lot better.
Now I feel well rested, and the occasional
thoughts I have are much clearer.-

Going caffeine-free is a mind-altering expe-
rience.

It’s an epiphany, just like discovering the

differences between boys and girls or switching
from briefs to boxers.

If you ask me, everyone should try to go caf-
feine-free for at least a month. _

Look at yourself, clutching your empty cof.-
fee mug in a shaky, white—knuckled grip with

' blood-shot eyes bulging out of your skull as you

internally scream, “Where’s my caffeine?”

You haven’t had-a good cup of joe in over I

seven minutes, and now your system cries for a
fix the way Rush Limbaugh cries for a jelly
donut laced with OxyContin.

Get a hold of yourself. '

Sure you will feel some tension at first, and
yes, you will feel sleepy, crabby and all-around
miserable’ for a while. ,7

But once that phase passes, you will be a new
person, ready-to seize the day with an unsur-
passed optimism.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I am about to go

gnaw my fingers until they are nubby, bloody

stumps." .

Pitt denies same—sex partners benefits, contrary to its own policies

The battle for equal status in the
university for lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender employees has been a long
one here at Pitt, and I wonder if the end
is near. I truly hope so, because I would
like to compliment my school as an
alumnus.

Pitt discriminates against LGBT
employees. Pitt decided to make mar-
riage the criterion ‘for granting, full
healthcare benefits to its employees.
This stands in stark contrast to the Pitt’s
own non-discrimination policy —- a pol-
icy which states that the university can-
not discrirninate based on sexual orien-

A tation or marital status.

Here in-Pennsylvania, it is illegal
for two people of the same sex to
become married under the Defense of
Marriage Act —- thank you, Bill Clinton.

This policy does not directly affect
me, other than serious allegations that
we will lose faculty because of it. Pitt
has said that this has happened, and it
makes Pitt a less attractive employer,
although Pitt considers these losses neg-
ligible. I have listened tothe powers in
the Cathedral of Learning make these
excuses for years, and, well, not one of
them has been able to convince me.

, Another way this affects our daily
lives is Pittsburgh’s Human Rights ordi-

 

nance. The university, in an attempt to
defend its homophobic stance,» has
decided to attack the city. I

As you read this, you cannot be dis-

criminated against in the
City of Pittsburgh because
of your sexual orientation.
This may not be so tomor-
row. Pitt thinks that
Pittsburgh should not be
able to protect its citizens
from discrimination. It is
too bad they do not read
their own non-discrirnina-
tion policy, because it also
includes 1“all applicable ’
laws ‘andiordinances of the .
Commonwealth . of -
Pennsylvania and the ' City of
Pittsburgh.” ~ ‘ ‘

Unfortunately, I was born with a
conscience. I see right and wrong, and
the university has wronged its LGBT
employees. Granting employees the
same affordable. benefits across the
board is not about gay rights or special
rights. It is about we, as a society, saying
equality is a standard that democracy
must subscribe to if it is to be democra-
tic.

Pitt prides itself in working with the
State Legislature, and Pitt makes it very

Columnist

clear that granting the same healthcare
to everyone would disrupt this fragile
relationship. After I paid the increase in
my tuition each year I have been here, I
could not help wonder why
we weren’t attempting to dis-
rupt this relationship. The
state cuts our ‘funding every
year, and it is not because we
are granting domestic part-
ner beneﬁts.

, It is absolutely pathetic
how late the budget is, but
preliminary research shows

not punished fortaking the
first leap to pursue equality.
In February, Temple, another
state-related university, decided to grant
healthcare beneﬁts to the partners of
LGBT employees. Nor has Penn State
been penalized for its developing a plan
to fund healthcare for these families. It
seems as though Mark Nordenberg’s
blaming of the state is a road incorrectly
taken. ' 4
Pitt and its affiliates are the largest
employers in the western Pennsylvania,
and that carries a lot of clout. The state
is hurting Pitt by cutting our funding
each year. It is absurd for us to continue
with this charade of saying that we have

that Temple University was '

a great working relationship. Let
Harrisburg know that we are in charge,
and we are to be listened to.

If the state is not to blame, then who
is making the decisions? I think, after

the outcome of the county executive‘

race, we may hear new responses. If
Allegheny County Executive Jim
Roddey — one of the most powerful
Republicans in the state —-— is ousted,
where does that leave Nordenberg? If
we recall, Roddey sat on the selection
committee to choose Nordenberg to
bravely lead'Pit_t into the new millenni-
um.

Many questions, arise, once we
scratch below the surface of the domes-
tic partner beneﬁts issue. Why does Pitt
pretend its marriage with Pennsylvania
is fine? Or is it that everything is ﬁne
and the power does not lie in the center
of Pennsylvania but in the western part?
Who is making the calls on domestic-
partner beneﬁts: queer-hating legisla-
tors, scared Pitt officials or an uncom-
promising administration? One thing is
for sure — Pitt actively discriminates
against LGBT employees.

Josh Ferris, a former organizer for this
issue, thinks he knows a lot. E-mail him

A near-flawless
Calculus lesson

Recommended if you like:

Local music, the underground‘

scene

Advanced ‘Calculus is the result of an
ambitious project undertaken by Carnegie

_ Mellon’s radio station, WRCI“ 88.3 FM.

This two-disc compilation set features 28

. tracks from 28 dilferent local, independent

musicians and bands culled from one-hour
setsfrom each act, recordedlive atWRCT.
The ambition of the set comes from

WRCT’s desire to bring attention to the »

independent and underground music of
Pittsburgh. While many in the city are famil-
iar with local musicians — The Clarks,
Mercury, Joe Grushecky and Donnie Iris are
all household names in the ‘Burgh —— those

same people wouldn’t_ be able to tell you
who Blunderbuss, Anivals & Departures or
(The) Alpha Control Group (C). This set
tries to change that.

“For every person who’s "out there look- -

ing to be moved by music there is no answer
that can’t be reached by exploration,”
Douglas P. Mosurock, co-owner of Version
City Records and an alumnus of WRCI‘,
states in the set’s liner notes. “This compila-
tion is a testament to such endeavors.”
Advanced Calculus does feature a few
bands that Pittsburghers with a general
knowledge of the local scene will recognize.
Lorelei, Life In Bed, Modey Lemon and

ne frustrating “Stain”

The Human Stain
Starring Anthony Hopkins,
Nicole Kidman_, Gary Sinise, Ed

. Harris

Directed by Robert Benton
‘ﬁffff ' -

?‘The Human Stain” is one of the
most frustrating near-great films in
recent memory. It’s not the sum of its
parts, but has parts too good to ‘T be
missedf its performances, Robert
Benton’s smooth direction and its
remarkable balance  through most of
the film‘ 7- of bitter cynicism and
poignant emotion.

Too bad Benton and screenwriter
Nicholas Meyer just can’t get ‘all the ele-
ments and tones of Philip Roth’s novel
of the same name to stick together on
screen. .

The downfall of Coleman Silk
(Anthony Hopkins), as told to us-by his
friend Nathan (Gary Sinise), begins with
the man being ﬁred from his teaching
position for allegedly racist remarks —-
he refers to some absentee students, who
he doesn’t even know are African-
American, as “spoo ,” as in “ghosts.”

 

At the height of the controversy,
Coleman’s wife suffers a fatal
embolism; Coleman considers the right-
eous people who dismissed him her
murderers.

Months later, he stumbles into an_

affair with the alluring Faunia (Nicole

.Kidman), a troubled janitor/post office

worker/rnilkmaid half his age who
shares with him her tragic past. During
this, what we know from the film’s first
scene "to be his last love, Coleman is
moved to face his own demons, to relive

-his most painful love. As he remembers,

we learn the film’s sad irony: Coleman is
actually a light—skinned African
American who’s pretended to be white
for most of his life. ‘

The film is primarily a portrait of a
life shaped by racism. There is but a sin-
gle ‘happy moment —— an awkward but
purebit of joy shared by Coleman and
Nathan early in the film. Otherwise, the
film is rather depressing.

Benton directs with a surprisingly

sure hand and a classy, laid-back style.

Composer Rachel Portinan and cine-
matographer Jean-Yves Escofﬁer lend
plenty of elegance. A

The cast presents a dichotomy: .

 

Hopkins and Kidman are sirnultaneous—
ly excellent and miscast. Their perfor-
mances‘ are affecting, just as long as you
can get past the fact that Kidman is too
graceful and Hopkins too white.

The film’s problematic structure and
resolution are its biggest issue. Its’ sad
parable about racism," its stabs at empty-
headed political correctness —— to which
the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal serves as
a backdrop .—- and its vague suspense
plot, featuring a spectacularly dangerous

 

 

Ed Harris as Faunia’s loony Vietnam vet
ex-husband, struggle to merge. The ﬁlm-
makers seem unsure wliich story to end
on; the resolution is unfocused and lacks
the resonance that the rest of the ﬁlm
works hard to create. The character of
Nathan, our narrator, is a casualty; he
ends up a glaring loose end.

“The Human Stain” falls short of ~_

greatness, but comes close‘ enough to
make it recommendable. R

Ryan andCampion should’v c

In the Cut
Starring Meg Ryan, Mark
Ruffalo, Jennifer Jason Leigh

Directed by Jane Campion
in“:

‘‘In the Cut,” which borders on
being an endurance test, is‘ at least the
anti—Meg Ryan film. Fans of the
actress who turn out for this one will

likely be frustrated by its ponderous ‘

narrative, disgusted by its nasty crime
scene carnage and shocked by its overt
sexuality.

It’s a thriller, by the way.

Ryan plays Frannie Avery, a sexu-
ally repressed writing professor who is
drawn into a grotesque nightmare —
director Jane Campion has intermit-

tent success using half-blurred pho-

tography and other devices to make
the film feel like a dream — of murder

and dangerous, irrational desire. This -

isn’t as provocative as it might sound.
What the film attempts to achieve
is somewhere around the territory of
Roman Polanski’s classic
“Repulsion,” an unnerving film about
a woman deconstructed by her repres-
sion. “In_the Cut,” however, is hinged
to a stilted serial killer mystery.
Campion and Susanna Moore —
Moore wrote the novel on which the
film is based and the pair co—wrote the
screenplay — create a murderer

. Frannie’s father proposed to her

whose methods are a cynical
reference to modern marriage
patterns: The killer “marries”
women, placing a wedding ring
on their finger, then, promptly, '
“divorces” them by cutting C
them to pieces. _

Duringtthe killer’s rampage,
ironically, Frannie and her
equally lonely half-sister
Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh)
seem to long" for men to enter
their lives and marry them. This
is despite their family history —

mother on a whim with a ring
meant for . another, later
divorced her and eventually
went through a total of five mar-
riages. Frannie’s romantic
vision of the proposal, seen by
us in off-kilter silent-movie
style footage, acts as a bizarre
chorus for the ﬁlm.

When a piece of one of the victims
is discovered in Frannie’s garden,
Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo)
comes into her life to question and
promptly seduce her. His crudeness
and aggressiveness make her — and
us 4 uneasy, and she has good reason
to believe he might actually be the
killer, but she can’t bring herself to
resist his advances.

She’ll have to solve the mystery to

   

know whether to feel good or bad
about sleeping with him.

It’s not exactly thrilling, by the
way.  A
g The ﬁlm is a rather grand failure
—— in large part because «of how
unwieldy and off-putting the material
is '— albeit an interesting, ambitious
one with excellent performances.
Ryan digs deeper into this than you’d
ever expect; there is no doubting the

pain of_ her character’s journey. Leigh
and the ferocious Ruffalo also thrive
in offbeat roles. T
And the final stab: Despite how
far the fihn strays from typical thriller

      

territory, its ending is unforgivably ’

conventional. .

. “In the Cut” is strictly for the curi-
ous. And even then, it’s not necessari-

Hear the sounds of the Violin  
with Roger Zahab on Tuesday

V1olinist—composer Roger Zahab of

A the University of Pittsburgh will give a

free recital tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium. Zahab, who
is known for his daring program selec-

‘ , tions, will perform some of his own work

as well as pieces by John Cage, Roger
Sessions, Iannis Xenakis and Carnegie
Mellon composer Reza Vali.

Born in Akron, Ohio, Zahab attribut-
es much of his early inﬂuences to the
Arabic folk music and Byzantine chant
he heard growing up. As aresult, melody
is a dominant feature of his compositions.
Informally, some of his biggest inﬂu-
ences, in terms of composition, have been
John Cage, Ursula Mamlok and Tison
Street. Having performed over 100 pre-

miers of different works, his recent com- -

missions include “Uncovered by Night,”
an opera that explores the history and

ghosts of Peninsula, Ohio, “August
Shade,” a multi-media performance
work, and a trilogy of compositions for
the Ohio Bicentennial in 2003.

Zahab is currently the University of
Pittsburgh’s orchestra director as well as
a violin instructor and lecturer. He has
written music for a variety of venues,
including chamber, vocal and orchestral,

as well as work in video, theater and

dance. “Doubles Keening,” “Fall/Retum”
and “Personal Dances” have recently
been recorded and his work has been
heard throughout Italy, Switzerland, Rio
de Janeiro, Bangkok, London and Lima.

Roger Zahab will perform a free recital
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the F rick Fine Arts

ration of the local scene and music to which
Mosurock refers. o

Disc one begins with -Blunderbuss’
“The Burning Bellhop,” a seven-minute,

crankable‘ rock track that hooks the listener .

with its skillful guitar work and unpolished
lyrics.  is followed by other standout
tracks from Arrivals & Departures (“What’s
French For...”), Thee Speaking Canaries
(“Summer_Band”) and Teddy Duchamp’s
Army (“Corporal”). V '

Thrown into the‘ mix of these rock-
inﬂuenced bands is an instrumental track
from The New Alcindors (“Inseam”) and
“Human Eye,” an off-kilter song from Weird
Paul about buying a human eye for a love.
Capping the ﬁrst disc is Young Steele

.Matula Trio’s “Discharge, Distribute,
Dismiss,” an eight—minute, jazzy ‘track that
sounds like it could have come oﬁ the
soundtrack of one of experimental ﬁlmmak-
er Maya Deren’s works. -

Disc two offers listeners the same sort
of diversity, beginning with the ethereal
instrumental “ mini” from Zombi. The
dirty independent rock sound of (The) Alpha
Control Group (C) (“’I‘he Baby Men”
comes next, followed by the a]most-free-
form instrumental rock “Dichotomy” from

10. Rock with a tinge of jazz of Black Moth
Super Rainbow (“Letter People Show”) and
the 17-minute experimental hip-hop capper
from Beam, “l00720(D” follow.

Advanced Calculus is remarkable for its
diversity in artists and sounds. While most
have a rock-based sound, it isn’t the rock you
would hear on mass-market radio. Instead,
the sound is dirtier and less polished, inde-

pendent and experimental. The majority of

the bands are founded in rock and stay in that
foundation. They branch off and create their
own sound.

Almost as remarkable is the set’s pol-
ished production. The set sounds just as
good as mass-produced products — some-
thing noteworthy considering these tracks
wererecorded in a studioon a university
campus. _

This is a collection that is essential for
fans of locally created music, as well as for
those in need of an advanced tutorial on
what the Pittsburgh has to offer. The local
scene is bigger and more vibrant than
Mercury or The Clarks. Advanced Calculus
features its caretakers and saviors. _

Pitt running back Jawan Walker rushes up ﬁeld as guard Dan LaCarte blocks out in front. Walker was responsible for all three
Panthers’ touchdowns as he caught, threw and rushed for a touchdown in the‘ Panthers 24-13 victory over Boston College.

Walker and Pitt defeat BC

J IMMY JOHNSON
‘Staff Writer

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. — Pitt running

back Jawan Walker had a career day at
Alumni Stadium on Saturday, scoring three
touchdowns in three different ways — run-

ning, receiving and passing, leading the way

to a 24-13 victory over Boston College.

Willi the win and the Miami loss to
Virginia Tech, the Panthers now control the
fate of the Big East.

Walker ran the ball into the end zone for
a 3-yard touchdown to put the Panthers up
10-3 early in the second quarter.

Then, with 13:39 left in the game, quar-
terback Rod Rutherford’ dropped back and

' threw a screen pass to Walker, who caught ’

the ball, then ran freely down the sideline
and into the end zone to put Pitt up 17-13.
Five minutes later, Walker took the
€handofI' frorri Rutherford. The secondary for
Boston College‘ bit on the run fake, and
Larry Fitzgerald, who ‘sold the run with a
block, ran free down the ﬁeld. Walker
stopped in the backﬁeld and ‘threw a high,
towering spiral, which Fitzgerald caught and

. ran into the end zone.

With that catch, Fitzgerald moved into
-the ranks. of the elite. He now holds the

NCAA record of 14 consecutive games with

 

a touchdown reception. Also, with that
touchdown,j Fitzgerald broke Jabar
Ga1fney’s NCAA mark for most touch-
downs caught in freshman and sophomore
' years. Fitzgerald now has 28 touchdowns in

his ﬁrst two years. 0 A .
“It’s probably the most wide-open I

l have been,” Fitzgerald said of the touch-

. down.
Even though the stat sheet has Walker’s

name next to all three touchdowns, credit has 3

to be given to the rest of the players on the
“[It was a] hard-fought football game,”
head coach Walt Harris said “We hada lot
of unsung heroes in the game —.— mostly the
offensive line."
Pitt (6-2 Overall, 3-0 Big East) ran for

124 yards ‘and the offensive line allowed the '
Boston College defense to sack Rutherford‘

only once. The protection allowed
Rutherford to complete 24 of 37 passes for
1329 yards. , \
“Our line has stepped up big—time,”-
Rutherford said
The offensive line also provided protec-
~ tion for Walker’s hallback-pass and had sev-
eral key blocks downﬁeld that tsprung
t Walker on the screen pass.
The Pitt offense kept the Panther
defense off the ﬁeld by controlling the clock,

 

holding the ball for 3633, while Boston
College had it for only 23:47.

“I’m very excited about the time of pos- A

session,” Harris said.

With 6:01 left in the game, the olfensive
line led the way to two Panther ﬁrst downs.
The drive burned 4:19 oif the clock.

‘ ,“It’s a great feeling to rim the clock out,”
left tackle Rob Petitii said. “[The offensive
line is] ﬁnally starting to play as one.”

Boston College (5-4, ’1-3 Big East)
received the ball ﬁrst and moved 62 yards
using the run. Rumiing back Derrick Knight
ran the ball on Boston College’s ﬁrst three
plays for a total of 38 yards. Quarterback
Quinton Porter ran the ball for seven yards
on the fourth play.

After a few more runs, Po1ter’s third-
down throw was deﬂected by Pitt’s nose
tackle Vince Crochunis, stopping the Boston
College drive at the Pitt 17-yard line. Sandro
Sciortino kicked a 34-yard ﬁeld goal to give
Boston College the early 3-0 lead . -

Fitzgerald’s  
TD catch
setsrecord    

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. -— For 13
games, Larry Fitzgerald fought
through double and triple coverage to

' catch at least one touchdown in each

contest. 
On Saturday, all Fitzgerald had to  
do was make sure he did, not drop the ,
ball. 

With just over eight minutes to i
go in the fourth’ quarter of Pitt’s 24-
13 win over Boston College, Rod
Rutherford pitched the ball to run— _
ning back Jawan.Wa1ker. After run-
ning towards the sideline and looking
to cut up-field, Walker slowed down
and lofted a pass over a stunned
Eagles’ defense.

Thirty—five yards later, a wide-
open Fitzgerald, who snuck behind
Boston College’s secondary, trotted
into the end zone for the score and a
spot in the record books all by him- . -. .
self. . '

For the 14th consecutive game,
the sophomore wide receiver scored
a touchdown, breaking the NCAA
record he shared with Michigan
State’s Charles Rogers for a week.
Rogers set the record last season
while playing for the Spartans.

“It’s quite an accomplishment,”
Fitzgerald said,’ grinning from ear to
ear. “It’s something I’ll be able to
look back on in about five or 10
years.”

Fitzgerald now has 28 touch-
down catches in his career, breaking
the NCAA mark for scoring recep-
tions as a freshman and sophomore,
set by Florida wide receiver Jabar
Gaffney during the 2000 and 2001
seasons. '

After catching seven balls for
156 yards and a score, Fitzgerald has
60 receptions for 1,174 yards this
year. And, with his 16th touchdown
of the season, he tied Julius
Dawkins’ Pitt record for scoring
receptions in a season. ' ,

But for more than three quarters,
it looked as if the streak might be
broken. ‘ ' - ‘

Cross Country qualifies for NCAA Regional Championships

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s cross
country teams competed in the Big East
Championships at Van Cortland Park in
New York on Friday and, despite not
living up to coach Waddie Freeman’s
expectations, both teams qualiﬁed for
the NCAA Regional Championships.
Even though there were a few excellent
individual accomplishments, Freeman
was disappointed with his team’s over-
all performance. .

“We didn’t have a particularly good
meet,” Freeman said. ‘

Pitt men finish eighth of 12 teams
Led by freshman Eric Flerr1ing’s
34th—place effort in the 8,000-meter
race, the Panthers finished in eighth
place at the Big East Championships.
“[It’s] deﬁnitely an improvement
for the men’s team over last year’s per-
formance,” Freeman said. “Eric
Fleming had a good race.” '
Georgetown, powered by junior
Rod Koborsi’s 24:38 showing, edged
Notre Dame to win the Big East title.
Also placing for Pitt were freshman
Andy Tomaswick in 54th place, juniors
Nick Westerrnan and Clinton Kotuby in

60th and 61st, respectively, and fresh:

men Michael Long in 66th place.

“Our number two through ﬁve run-
ners didn’t have a good meet,” Freeman
said. ' _ '

'" Despite the men’s team’s eighth-
place finish, the Panthers did qualify
for the NCAA Regional
Championships at Lock Haven in two
weeks. -

“Our team goal at the regional is to
ﬁnish in the top third of our region,”
Freeman said. “[The men’s team] did
okay [at the Big East Championships],
but this will deﬁnitely prepare us for
the regional championships.”

Pitt women finish ninth out of 14
teams -

Despite Maureen McCandless’ sec-
ond-place ﬁnish in her return from a-
knee injury, the Panthers struggled in
taking ninth place at the Big East
Championships. . .

“Maureen did okay,” Freeman said. '
“She hadn’t competed in over a

month.”

Notre Dame, led by sophomore
Molly Huddle’s 20:47 effort in the
6,000-meter race, scraped by
Providence College to capture its sec-
ond consecutive Big East crown.

Also placing for Pitt was junior
Lauren Shaffer in 38th place, freshman
Suzette Bossart finished 58th, and
sophomores Nicola Angstadt and
Abigail Zaylor ﬁnished 73rd and 80th
respectively. .

“Lauren Shaffer was steady,”
Freeman said. “This was the first time
this year that there was a 30—second gap
between our first- and ﬁfth- place run-

ners, so I think we’ll rebound from
that.” _

Even though the team turned in a
sub-par performance, the Panthers did
manage to qualify for the NCAA
Regional Championships and will

accompany the men’s’ team to Lock “

Haven.

“I think we’ll have a better meet at
the regional,” Freeman added. “We def-
initely want to go to the NCAA
Regional Championship and ﬁnish in
the top ten.” .

Both teams will compete at the
NCAA Regional Championships on
Nov. 15. I

Pitt wrestles off to prepare
for Michigan State Classic

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

A young, injury—p1agued Pitt
wrestling squad held its annual wrestle-
offs on Saturday to determine who would
get the starting nods for the 2003-2004

“season. ,

Pitt was unable to compete in its usual
number of weight classes, thanks in part to.
recent knee surgeries performed on juniors

Zachariah Doll and Tyshawn Scarlett. But ’

despite having a banged-up roster and a
team lacking in experience, head coach
Rande Stottlemyer is excited about the
upcoming season. ,

‘‘We’re excited to get things under-
way,” Stottlemyer said. “We’re tired of
practicing, and I’m looking forward to see-
ing the guys in real competitive situation.”

In the 141-pound weight class, sopho-
more Ronald Tarquinio swept sophomore
Norm Lohman, 2-0. At 157 pounds, Justin
Nestor swept freshman Tim Allen, and

sophomore Frances Iorfrdo got a 2-0 win
over Donald Rush in the 174-pound
weight class.

The most tightly contested matchup of
the day came at 184 pounds, where junior
Mike Croyle was able to defeat freshman
Joe Ammendola in a decisive third bout.

“We’re not going to get our best line-
up. in there for a while,” Stottlemyer said.
“We’ve got some veterans coming off of
injuries, and we’re looking at the potential
of starting a lot of ﬁrst and second year
guys for the ﬁrst half of. the season.” ’

“The good thing about that is that our
youth will gain us a lot of experience ﬁrst
semester,” Stottlemyer said. “It’s a really
young group with not a lot of experience,
but some very good talent.”

The young Panthers will be put to the
test early, as they start off the season this
weekend at the Michigan State Classic,
which will feature many nationally ranked
teams; The tournament is set to start at
noon in East Lansing, Michigan. 3

Boston College did not take advantage
of the tumover, and punted the ball back to
Pitt. -
After a few drives ending in punts on
both sides, Pitt compiled an eight-play, 83-
yard drive that ended with a 32-yard ﬁeld
goal by David Abdul that tied the game at
three.

Before the ﬁeld goal, there was a ques-
tionable call made on a pass thrown to
Fitzgerald in the end zone. Pitt had the ball
on the 10-yard line, and Fitzgerald lined up
in one-on-one coverage on the wide side of
the ﬁeld Fitzgerald ran out for the pass, but
it was a ball thrown low and too far inside
and the referee called it an incomplete pass.

“'Iherefereethatrnadethecall,Ihad

that the referee did not have the positioning
to see him make the catch “I felt it was [a

Pitt forced the Eagles to punt after three
plays on their next drive, and the Panthers

and would score with Walker’s rushing
touchdown. I .

Boston College struck back on its next
drive with a 1-yard touchdown run by run-
ning back Horace Dodd. It was his ninth on
the season. '

The Eagles started the drive with great

Pitt squandered two opportunities to tie

record setting touchdown reception

“He wouldn’t tell you, but he was
frustrated,” Rutherford
Fitzgerald, who had been kept out of
the end zone by Boston College.

Fitzgerald was not without his
chances. ‘ .

In the first quarter, with Pitt trail-
ing 3-0, Rutherford found Fitzgerald
streaking down the sideline towards
the goal line. The pass hit Fitzgerald
in stride, but strong safety Paul Cook
kept the receiver from getting into
the end zone, shoving him out of
bounds at the 5—yard line.

.“I tried to kick it into second
gear,” Fitzgerald said, “but I couldn’t
kick it ‘into [second -gear] and the
safety got over there.”

Fitzgerald had two more chances
on the drive. 

On the next play, Rutherford loft-
ed the ball into the [corner of the end
zone, but the officials ruled that
Fitzgerald caught the ball out of
bounds. Two plays later, it looked as
if he had broken the record to the
back judge, but the sideline official
disagreed.

“The ball was over. my back
shoulder,” Fitzgerald said. “The
defensive back got his hand in there.
I caught it between my legs, but the
referee [that made the call], Ihad my

«back to him.”

After ‘four receptions of more

College shut down the big play capa-
bility of Pitt’si offense, taking
Fitzgerald out of the game. and forc-
ing Rutherford to dump the ball off to
his stable of runningbacks. _

. “A lot of teams have been giving
[us] big plays,” Rutherford said.
“Boston College made a conscious
effort to take that away.”

In order to keep the streak alive,
the Panthers needed to put a wrinkle
into their offense.

“Every time we practiced [the

.halfback—option pass], I was wide

open,” Fitzgerald said. “I just execut-_
ed my assignment; you just do what
you’re coached to do. I saw [the cor-
nerback] bite and I knew I had it.”

With the win and Miami’s loss to
Virginia Tech, the Panthers enter the
final third of their season with a
legitimate shot at winning the Big
East Championship. According to
Fitzgerald, that’s all that really mat—.
ters. ,

“I was excited, just like every-
body else was,” he said. “[But] hon-
