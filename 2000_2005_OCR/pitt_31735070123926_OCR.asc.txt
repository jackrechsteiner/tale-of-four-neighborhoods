a shorter spring term
for most Pitt students

eter -E. Siska’s teaching
load will be lighter this
semester, and he’s not

happy about it.
The chemistry professor isn’t

teaching fewer courses._ But‘

because Pitt’s spring term started
later than usual this year (I an. 7),
Siska’s courses — and those of
most other teaching faculty here
—' will meet. less frequently.
During the term, Siska ﬁg-
ures, he will lose two 50-In/inute
periods from the class he teaches
on Mondays, Wednesdays‘ and

Fridays, and one 75-minute

 

 ':’:a  7-'1, , , .,
. ..  . r»- .. 7,...,...-  . _. .—, ,,

‘Losing those hours “forces
all of us to revamp and further
squeeze our course syllabi,” Siska
complained in a Jan. 3 e-mail
to Vice Provost Elizabeth U.
Baranger.

“Our awarding three credits

for a 14 1/2-week course is

already a travesty, but this makes ‘

it worse,” he wrote. , —

Baranger, who chairs the
committee of faculty, staff and
administrators that advises Pitt’s
senior administration on the

. academic calendar,_ sympathizes

with Siska. “I have always been a
strong advocate for having more

days in the term,” she told the -

University Times. .
And Baranger acknowledged

that, even in years when Pitt’s_

springterm begins closer to Jan.
1, academic terms here typically
are shorter than those at many
peer universities.

During 1999-2000 (the most

recent academic year for which
statistics were available), Pitt
provided 71 "days of instruction
in the fall and 72 days in the
spring, she said.

Among the 23 other public

institutions that belong to the_

Association of American Uni-
versities (AAU), only six had
fewer instructional days than
Pitt in fall'1999, and only seven
had fewer instructional days in
spring 2000. (Penn State, for
example, provided 74 days of

instruction in fall 1999 and 75 ._

days in spring 2000.)

Pitt academic calendar plan-
ning was constrained this spring
by two factors, Baranger said:

° New Year’s Day fell ‘on a
Tuesday and the University re-
opened the next day. Pitt never

' resumes classes the same day it

10  .

re-opens following the holiday
break (“That would just be
havoc,” Baranger said), so the
earliest Pitt could have resumed

classes was Thursday, Jan. 3. ‘

“The. academic calendar com-
mittee .felt pretty strongly that
if we had started classes on
Thursday, many students would

not have come back until the ‘

following Monday anyway,”
Baranger said. 9

' Pitt’s spring term tfadition- ,.

‘ally ends in late April. This

year, the term ends on April”

27. Commencement is the fol-

important to both our faculty and

our students for commencement,

to be held by the beginning of
May,at the latest, ” Baranger said.
“The students want to get jobs.
The faculty want to go off to do
research in the ﬁeld.” .
The vice provost said she
would feel “much more comfort-
able” if Pitt were to extendits
spring term by one week during

years such as .2002, 2003 and A
2004 when New Year’s Day falls t

in mid-week.

Baranger said she will propose
that idea to the academic calendar
committee. 0

The committee also may look

g into a suggestion by Siska to free '

up an additional day for spring

term classes by moving Pitt’s-

observance of Martin Luther
King Jr.’s birthday to the spring
break for students. However,
Baranger said she believes that
move would be “politically
almost nnpo§sible.”

The ‘University already
observes Great Americans Day

. during spring break, a move Pitt
‘ made in 1998 to restore a class‘

day in February while maintain-
ing the holiday forstaff.

“We got some ridicule and
jokes about that, but no serious
complaints,” Baranger said. “On
the other hand, I think people
would be offended if we moved
[Pitt’s observance of] Martin
Luther King’s birthday. ButI will
the idea to the attention
of various people and see what
their reactions are.”

Pitt should
allow spouses,
children to ‘use.
campus pools

To the editor: ,

I am writing in regards to
the news item related to the
use of Trees pools (University
Times, Dec. 6, 2001). I have
these comments about the new
policy. My comments are not:
much about the bureaucratic
detail of how such a change in
policy should be handled. I want
to draw your readers’ attention
to whether or not this change
makes any sense.

I have used the Trees Pool
rather regularly for the past 10
years or so. More recently,I have
also used the Belleﬁeld pool. I
do not think that allowing the
children and their spouses poses
any real threat.

First, now we have three I

ools (two at Trees and one in
Belleﬁeld Hall). It is unreason-
able to keep all of these pools
completely closed for the spouses

‘and their children.‘ We have

lifeguards at these pools. We
have rules and regulations. The

people I have seen using the pool -

adhere to these rules. Also, I have
not yet seen spouses that are

1 “running around” the swimming

pools. Yes I have, occasionally,
seen little children. running
around and their parents and/or
lifeguards have told them to stop
and they have. In my opinion,
there is no justiﬁcation for not
allowing the spouses and children

" . who are accom anied b their
P .7. . .
-parents) to use these facilities

during reasonable hours. It is
about time that we trust the
faculty, staff and students of this
University in their ability to
follow the rules and enjoy the
beneﬁts._It is also time for us
to be more rational about these
types of situations and not give in
to a bunch of lawyers. Managing
risk should not equate to being
irrational in our thinking. Yes, if

- there is an accident that is going

to happen, it will. The University
can issue special swimming pool

‘ID cards and in doing so ask the

parents to sign an indemniﬁca-
tion clause. Swimming is an

activity that a lot of people like to
enjoy all year around. We have

quite a few of our staff, graduate .

students and faculty who would
like to use these facilities. This
is indeed a perquisite for many
who work on the Pitt campus.
Let us have a rational policy that

encourages people of the Pitt’

community to use and enjoy
our swimming pools safely.
Managing risks does not usually
require these types of Draconian
measures. Also, we need to
consider all constituencies of the

, campus community. In my view,

it is not unreasonable to ﬁnd a
two- hour time slot each evening
and perhaps a three—hour time
slot on the weekends at one of
these pools to let the spouses,
faculty and children enjoy our
swimming pools.

unbecoming
comment i

To the editor:

I hate to sound like a grinch by
harshly and perhaps ungratefully
raining on Pitt head football
coach Walt Harris’s parade,
especially since his impressive

Panthers’ have now gone on to‘

win six straight games (with a
season’s record of 7-5), topped
off by their decisive victory over
North Carolina State University
in the Tangerine Bowl (34-19).
Nevertheless, I believe that the
incident described below should
be called to the attention of the
university community and not
swept under the carpet. . .

In the sports section of the
Dec. 1 issue of the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette, Coach Harris,
contemplating his ‘team’s game
with the University of Alabama-
Birmingham on Dec. 1 at Heinz
Field, is quoted as having said
that he “...was hoping that‘ they’d
[UAB] have some injuries...”
presumably so that UAB would
be less competitive“ against the
Pitt Panthers.

Have I gotten this straight?
A collegiate coach is hoping that
his opponents in a game (and
it’s only a game, ‘mind you) will
sustain injuries? If it’s injuries
that Coach Harris craves let him

join the Marines or the Special.

Forces and ﬁght the bad guys in
Afghanistan’s exotic caves and
twisting tunnels, rather than
yearn for injuries to college
kids-.

. I always thoughtthat a col-
legiate football coach (say a
Knute Rockne, a]oe Paterno, a
Jock Sutherland) should be an

inspiration to and a role model

Clariﬁcation

for his student athletes who bust
their butts’to get victories for
their coaches, not an embar-
rassing symbol of unsportsman-
like wishes. The University o_f
Pittsburgh deserves better than
Coach Harris, even though his
team ended up with a winning
season undaunted by their earlier
ﬁve straight losses. Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg and Athletic
Director Steve Pederson should
take Coach Harris out to the .
proverbial woodshed! .

Coach Wizlt Harris responds:

I wantito take this opportunity
to thank the entire University
of Pittsburgh community for its
tremendous support of our football
program this ﬁzll. _The 2001 season
will go down as one of our most
memorable in recent years, and

Panthers’ first bowl victory in 12
years. I know ﬁrsthand how hard"
our student-athletes worked to
achieve that feat. I think I am
most proud, though, of how they

represented themselves and our

University. They played with the
heart of champions and conducted ’
themselves with the highest levels
of class. _I know you share my pride .
in these ﬁne young men. _

Much like the classroom, sports _
can provide an education" that
will last a lifetime. We learned
some valuable lessons from our 1-5
start, including the importance
of perseverance, unity and hard ‘
work. Those principles helped our:
players rebound this season and
will continue to help them as they
leave our University and become

There are times in sports when
things don ’t go so well! Sometimes a

I made a similar gaffe off the ﬁeld

Injuries are a gravely serious
matter and I realize in retrospect

inappropriate. I genuinely apologize

UNIVERSITY SENATE

M A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

Last month the University Senate executive
corrimittee metwith William Dietrich, chairperson
of Pitt’s Board of Trustees. The. meeting lasted
approximately one hour and, using diplomatic
jargon, there was a “frank exchange of views.”
Quite reassuring was the fact there was consider-
able agreement between the Senate officers and
Mr. Dietrich on a number of subjects. On afew
) ‘ subjects we agreed in principle but probably
would not be in agreement on the application of a principle
to some speciﬁc situations. The differences in perspectives of
faculty and board should not be overlooked _

One subject -on which there" was clear agreementwas
discarding the former practice of awarding bonuses to the
chancellor and other key University administrators. Many
faculty opposed the practice and it attracted attention, not

always favorable, in the media. Mr. Dietrich had not been a

supporter of awarding bonuses and was pleased by elimination
of that practice, which was given attention recently when the
board’s compensation committee awarded pay increases but no
bonuses to the chancellor and others last month. ,
The compensation increases, particularly the chancellor’s,
led me to give the subject more thought than usual because, at
the same time, there were several pieces in the media concerning
compensation of university football and basketball coaches. For
example, Nick Saban, coach of the Louisiana State University
football team, receives a salary of $1.4million per year. Other
coaches receive even higher yearly compensation. Although I
don’t woriy that Chancellor Mark Nordenberg will be unable
to feed and clothe his family properly, Icthink it is interesting
to note that Mr. Saban, on his $1.4 million, probably pays
about as much in federalincome tax as the chancellor receives
in- total University compensation. Perhaps this compensation
differential says somethingabout the societal views ofthe value of

' leadership of a major _university sport program when compared

with leadership of a prominent educational institution.

The largest, single element in accounting for success of a‘

football or basketball team seems to be the recruiting of talented
athletes; Recruiting entails dealing with the athletes and their
family members, to convince the prospects that the university,

or the program,” is right for them. »

Chancellor—‘Nordenberg -engages in some activities that

resemble those of coaches .111 recr11i,t:iI.1g.- .. ;171°..>=Y!t€>.r1.<-°»..z=.\.t. s;(>.I.!i!i.I,19.iI[1,8 '

state legislators and prospective donors that the University
deserves their ﬁnancial support. ’_

The success of a big—time athletic program coach is measured
simply in wins and losses. The coach’s success depends on the

performance of young people aged 18-22, who often are difﬁcult

to manage or to lead. The success of a university chief executive
does not necessarily lend itself to as simple a measurement
process and we are all most probably better off because of

that fact. Of course, to a considerableﬂextent a university chief. ,
- executive’s success depends on the performanceof others, some

of whom are sometimes difﬁcult to manage-or to lead.

In the ﬁnal piece I wrote for “University Senate Matters”
while Senate president, I said there were ,“some bullies and petty
tyrants in positions of authority,” and that there apparently
was reluctance on the part of some in higher positions, when
poor conduct by -such persons came to their attention, to take

appropriate action. In that piece I pointed out that facultywithout

tenure are particularly vulnerable to abusive superiors.

In early Decemberga former female medical school faculty

member won a verdict of ,more than a half million dollars,
based on her claim that she was intentionally discriminated

against on the basis of 1 gender. Technically, she was not

discharged; her faculty‘ appointment was allowed to expire
without reappointment, but the verdict treated her as having been
discharged.’ Of the total award, $300,000 was for “humiliation”
and “injury to professional standing and reputation.” She
also has sought reinstatement but no court decision on that
matter has been rendered. ’ ‘

I I reviewed the case at the federal courthouse.’ I..did not read ,

the entire ﬁle, but skimmed some of the documents in it. Since
I. did not hear the testimony and did not review documents
presented to the jury, I won’t offer an opinion on whether the
verdict was correct. ,The, litigation indicated the complexity of

the situation when the medical school department chairperson .

is also the ’UPMC. Health System’s supervisor of the faculty"
member. It was not clear-whether the physician’s alleged failings

leading to the negative evaluation by the department chairperson ,

and her contract not being renewed were related mainly to
matters relevant to the services she rendered rather than to
traditional academic concerns, but that appeared to be the case.
It seems clear thatone way to terminate a iﬁm-tenured medical
school faculty member’s clinical practice at UPMC is to allow
the individual’s faculty appointment to expire.) _ *

This litigationraises the question of whether there is any
effective redress available to, a faculty member who is the subject
of oppressive conduct, other than going to court to seek to
prove a violation of federal or state law after being.“forced out.”

One would hope that there is an internal process that would

tee Dec. 6 raised Chan-

cellor Mark A. Nordenberg’s
salary by 5.4 percent to $342,500
for ﬁscal year 2002.

Trustees also approved, at
Nordenberg’s recommenda-
tion, raises for seven other Pitt
administrative ofﬁcers. The new
salaries are retroactive to July
1, the beginning of Pitt’s -ﬁscal
year.

“The University of Pittsburgh
continues to gain momentum
as it moves through a period

7 , of extraordinary accomplish-

ment,” board chair William S.
Dietrich II said in announcing
the compensation committee’s
determination. “During the

i ‘ past year, for example, both

undergraduate applications and
student body quality reached all-
time highs. We attracted research

. support at record-setting levels.
. ’Our capital ‘campaign moved
forward well ahead of schedule I

and set a new regional record for
private fund-raising.”

Dietrich also cited the Uni-
versity’s role ‘in regional initia-
tives, including. the Pittsburgh
Digital Greenhouse and the

1 Pittsburgh Life Sciences. Green-
« house, and capital construction

projects on the Pittsburgh and
regional campuses.

A “The Board of. Trustees is

includes making certain that they

are appropriately compensated _'

ments,” Dietrieh added.

The compensation commit-
tee met via a speakerphone

I what might be termed a just solution, and thus avoid the need _
for faculty members to resort to litigation. My experience as," ’
Senate president leads me to believe that intervention byisenior
administrators» to remedy injustices by their subordinates can

In‘Deuteronomy 16, verse 18, judges and ofﬁcers are enjoined
to “judge the people with righteous judgment.” An administrator
should not feel’ obliged to, support reﬂexively the personnel
decision of a subordinateif the faculty member involved solicits
the administrators intervention} Rather, as a’ leader, the more _
senior adrninistrator should responsibly assert the authority of
office by reviewing the situation and taking action if warranted, so
' that justice will follow. Such intervention mayxserve to curb poor
conduct by the subordina'te in future situations. .
I don’t know what impression anarticle, such as the one in

“This has been another year of

in recommending the ofﬁcers’
salaries. “One of the critical fac-
tors in the high levels of success

V the leadership provided by the

Med schoolestablishes immunology dept.

’ Pitt’s School of Medicine has

announced the formation of a

new Department oflnimunology ,

for more than 30 of its faculty
members currently working in
various departments on research
projects in immunology, as well
as for teaching and trainin
students and fellows. '
Immunology, thestudy of
the immune system,'is a formal
academic discipline with impact
on many other basic andclinical
disciplines. Current immunol-
ogy research at Pitt includes
transplant immunology, autoim-
munity, cancer immunology,
viral immunology (HIV/AIDS)

and immunology of infectious

. disease. a

Traditionally, immunology
has been practiced within depart-
ments of microbiology, pathol-

ogy, infectious diseases, medicine

and surgery.

“The trend in recent years
has been to create stand—alone
academic departments of immu-
nology in recognition of the
growth and importance of this
scientiﬁc discipline,” said Olivera
Finn, professor and acting chair-
person of the new Department
of Immunology and leader of
the immunology program at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute.

0 “A Department of Immunol-
ogy at the University of Pitts-

, burgh recognizes our ‘long-
standing excellence in immunol-

ogyresearch and training.”
“We are extremely excited
about the formation of the new
Department of Immunology,”
said Arthur S. Levine, senior

vice chancellor for the Health;

Sciences and dean, School of
Medicine. “It will provide a

needed academic home for the
innovative research in immunol-

ogy we are currently conduct-

ing-and foster the further devel-
opment and visibility. of this
discipline.”

Levine added that he expects
that the new department will

' allow the University to flourish

in basic immunology research by
integrating and combining fac-
ulty strengths. I

the term by the end of April.

“I voted for [that schedule]
and I’m one of the hard-nosed"
people on the committee in terms
of arguing against eliminating
class days,” said Chapman, an
associate professor.

Siska agreed that, if Pitt had
resumed classes last Thursday,
many students probably would
have blown off classes until
Monday in order to extend their
holiday breaks. He noted thatlast

of the students in his physical
chemistry class failed to show

up.

. “I guess the reason I’m frus-
trated is that, in chemistry, the
lecture part of a course is" so
critical,” Siska said. “Losing a
couple of class periods is‘ very
important to us.

. “It may be that few other
people on campus care about
this. The students certainly won’t
mind having fewer lectures,” he
said, with a laugh.

In contrast to‘ spring; term

been consistent and predictable
since 1998, when the University
started holding its first classes of

UNIVERSIITY TIMES

The city as classroom:

Urban studies program provides

students with variety of options

know: VVhat can a student

do with an urban studies
major? '

The answer, according to
Pitt’s Urban Studies Program
coordinator, is up to the student.
“I work with students to try to
get them to understand ﬁrst of
all what it is they want to do, and
then what the various jobs and
careers you can go into are and
how to structure their courses,”
says Carolyn Carson, who also
serves as adviser for the some 55
urban studies majors.

“People do wonder what
urbanstudies is,” she acknowl-
edges. “Most students are clue-
less at ﬁrst. We get students who

Inquiring minds want to

really aren’t sure what direction ,

they. want to go in. Perhaps
they’re interested in? sociology,
but don’t really want to major
in it; all they know is they like
social issues. Or they’re really
interested in government but
don’t want only political science.
They may be studying biology
because they want, to go into
public health, but it’s the urban
issues that attract them to us,
and they want that background,
too. Urban studies gives us
tremendous ﬂexibility to explore
their interests — that’s the beauty
of it.” i '

Hljrban studies students can
prepare for the private, for-
proﬁt world, or the public and
private non-proﬁt sector. They
can pursue careers in planning,
community organization, public
administration, economic devel-
opment, housing, education,
journalism and government.
Many students continue on
to graduate school in educa-
tion, urban planning, public
administration, public health,
criminal justice, law and other
disciplines.

“We are not here to simply
educate students in a particular
discipline. Rather our role is to
open their eyes to the world,
whether that world is the neigh-
boring public housing com-
munity or a city on the other side

‘of the globe. As they learn to

think critically they will develop
the ability to make change in
the world and to make rational,
perhaps inﬂuential, decisions in
their lives and work,” Carson
says.

The burgeoning program at
Pitt, .tucked in a tiny pocket on
the third ﬂoor of Posvar Hall,
is intentionally not designed
as a pre-professional program,
Carson says. As an interdisciplin-
ary liberal arts program, urban
studies draws on courses from
across the University, particu-
larly in Arts and Sciences. The
program does not have its own
faculty except for Carson, who
teaches the intro course and typi-
cally a summer elective course,
and program director Edward K.
Muller, whose primary appoint-
ment isiin history. ~

Urban studies as an academic
discipline crystallized in the
1970s, Carson says. At Pitt, the
program has been growing from

4

the 2 5-30 majors, just a few years
ago. “The program has grown

enormously in the last few years.

.I’m ‘not exactly sure why. The

quality of students has risen
dramatically, too, although that
may well reﬂect what’s going on
generally at the University. I have
many more honors students, and
we have a signiﬁcant number
of double andtriple majors.
Students may be majoring in
one area for career purposes,
but they’re real interested in the
urban environment and urban
studies is the logical double
major.”

Pitt’s Urban Studies Program
offers four concentrations: urban
planning, urban management,
community organization and
comparative urbanism.

Majors are required to take

‘ the introductory course, which

is usually the student’s first
exposure to urban studies, as part

tions, but Carson is working
on expanding the program’s
comparative urbanism concen-
tration. Last summer, she did
some first-hand research in
Europe, with funding-from the
CAS dean’s ofﬁce and the West-
ern European Studies Program,
studying Paris, Avignon, Nice,
Provence, Rome, Florence and
Venice.

She expects the concentration ~

eventually will draw a signiﬁ-
cant number of students with
the increasing popularity of
study abroad programs, second-'
language acquisition and the

growing acknowledgment 'of_

globalization.

“We will look at the city
historically world—wide,” Carson
says. “We’ll look at the city in

relation to planning issues and,

the use of space, how the city
relates to social and economic

issues and how to get some sense

rel Hill Urban Coalition and
the Pittsburgh Partnership for
Neighborhood Development to
the Department of City Planning
and the Heinz Regional History
Center.

“Some students come out
of an internship ﬁnding out
they really donit want to do
something, but what it does is

help the student ﬁnd out what"

their strengths and weaknesses
are.” __ g

The ﬁeld placement intern-
ship also provides the occasional
job offer from the sponsoring
organization, and, more often,
the networking potential to get
a job. “The real point is they
get experience. They can apply
what they’ve learned in the
classroom,” Carson says.

Other classroom supplements
include city tours and neighbor-
hood analysis. “I have four tours
in my intro class, and students
have to go on at least one of them.
I also have assignments where,
based on readings, they have to
go oI'1”"their own to analyze the
functions and uses of a particular
public space, and to analyze the
use of sidewalks at at least two
different times of day, and to
write essays about that.”

what’s really going on in the
neighborhood. This isn’t a his-
torical tour. Thisis a tour where
they’re walking down the street
and looking at housing and
trying to understand: Is this a

Is this a neighborhood that’s
become gentriﬁed? VVho lives
there? Who works there? VVhy?
Whatcontributes to that?

“We also meet with people
in community development
organizations in each neighbor-
hood and hear from people
who live there. It’s the practical
education that teaches students
how to think critically, how to

make informed choices about "

where they want to live and

. work.” *

And Pittsburgh is a perfect
place for studying urban issues,
she says. “It’s a laboratory for
this program, an ideal setting
for study: one, because it’s a

~ manageable size; two, because
"it has a history to it, which is ‘

similar to other American cities;

courses in communication, legal

history of art and architecture,
administration of justice and
social work, among others.

Urban planning and com—'

munity organization currently
ate the more popular concentra-

 

of how world cities ﬁt into the
whole notion of globalization,
of what makes a global city.”
She adds that, according to 1999
ﬁgures, for the ﬁrst time more
than half the world’s population
lives in an urban environment.
One of the strengths of the
Urban Studies Program is the
six credits of ﬁeld placement,
Carson says. More than 50 local
sites have accepted urban stud’-
ies interns over the past few
years, ranging from the Squir-

course, with its 12 three-hour
classes format, each class is spent
in a"particular neighborhood,
Carson says. “We take a bus. We
go to the South Side, Bloomﬁeld,

“But we use Pittsburgh ‘to
study the city in general. Pitts-

are not taking urban studies

New start-up ﬁrm focusing on muscle-derived stemcells  

Pitt and Cook Group Inc.,

of Bloomington, Ind., are col- I

laborating on potential, uses
for adult stem cells in treating
disease.‘

Through Pitt’s Office of
Technology Management
(OTM), the Pittsburgh—based
company, Cook MyoSite, has
licensed technologies related to
stem cells derived from adult
muscle tissue. These muscle-
derived stem cells have the ability
to repair diseased or damaged
muscle, bone and cartilage, and
to deliver therapeutic genes.
Cook Group will provide the

initial ﬁnancing and management a ~

for Cook MyoSite.

“We are pleased to launch
this important new start-up
company in partnership with
such a well-established and
respected company as Cook
Group,” said Pitt Provost James
Maher. “We believe this ﬁrm

is well suited to capitalize on
the breadth of potential applica-
tions of this adult stem cell
technology.”

- According to Cook Group '

president Kern Hawkins, “The
Cook organization has a tremen-
dous history of innovation, and
we see this collaboration with
the ,University of Pittsburgh as
another area where we can help
provide breakthrough medical
solutions to patients around the
world.”

“Adult stem cells hold great
promise in treating a broad range
of human diseases,” said Carl
Cook, president of Cook Myo-
Site. “Building on the pioneer-
ing work of Pitt’s outstanding
researchers, I believe this new
company will soon be at the
forefront of developing com-
mercial medical applications
using this exciting biotechnol-
ogy.”

The Pitt research teams

that developed the stem_ cell

technologies were ledbyjohnny
Huard and Michael Chancellor.
Huard is an associate professor,
division of Orthopaedic Sur-

. gery, Molecular Genetics and

Biochemistry, in the School -of

Medicine; an associate professor

of bioengineering in the School a

of Engineering, and director of
the Growth and Development
Lab at Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh. ‘ ..

Chancellor is a professor of
urology and gynecology in the
School of Medicine.

Huard and Chancellor will be
on the scientiﬁc advisory board
for Cook MyoSite and will serve
as consultants to the company.
Their collaboration was fostered
by networking assistance and
seed funding from the Pittsburgh
Tissue Engineering Initiative, an

toﬁanization supporting tissue

engineering research and related
economic development in Pitts-
burgh. They received additional
support for this research from the

GSPIA sets up clinic to aid nonproﬁts

Pitt’s Graduate School of

8 Public and International Affairs

(GSPIA) has launched a clinic
whose mission is to assist regional
nonproﬁts in becoming high-
performing organizations.
“Throughout the United
States, and particularlyin western
Pennsylvania, the nonproﬁt
sector has grown dramatically
in the past three d'ecades,” said
Leon L. Haley, Pitt associate
professor of P public affairs and
director of the new Nonproﬁt
Clinic. “Nonproﬁt organizations
are facing numerous issues, such
as how to increase accountability,

‘ how» to be more effective in

fund-raising, how to improve

I organizational performance and

how to develop‘ effective leader-

ship and management‘ systems.
Many of these organizations do
not have the ﬁnancial means
to. meet their organizational
development and performance
enhancement needs. We believe
that in many cases GSPIA can
provide, through our faculty
and students, the help they need
through our new Nonproﬁt
Clinic.”

‘ Funded in. part through a
grant from the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, Pitt’s
Nonproﬁt Clinic will provide
services to qualifying organiza-
tions at no cost, Other nonproﬁt
organizations with greater
ﬁnancial resources will be asked
to make a nominal contribution
to the clinic to cover the costs

Jared L. Cohon the 2001 Pitts-
burghers of the Year, citing
their deepening collaboration on
ventures important to Pittsburgh
and joint efforts to secure the
city’s place in the global com-
munity.

In 1998, Nordenberg and
Cohon approved the concept of
the Pittsburgh Digital Green-
house, an economic develop-
ment effort linking academia,
government and industry. Three
years ago, the two men decided
to combine their universities’
strengths in information technol-

ogy and biotechnology in form—=

ing the Pittsburgh Life Sciences
Greenhouse. With a goal of
creating 5,500 new jobs, the
initiative will unite universities,
companies and govermnent to
bring new medical techniques,
devices and drugs to market.
Last ,October, Nordenberg
and Cohon presided over the
unveiling of the Pittsburgh
SupercomputingCenter’sTeras-
cale Computing System, located
in the Westinghouse Energy
Center in 'Monroeville. The
university leaders were credited
with securing funding for the
system, which can perform six

trillion calculations per second.

director of Public Affairsisince
October 1999 and the Universi-
ty’s spokesman, last month was
named vice chancellor for Public

‘ Affairs.

Since assuming direction of
Public Affairs, Hill has expanded
and reorganized the division,
creating the Executive Commu-
nications unit, which comprises
Pitt and PittMed magazines
and writing of other official
University communications; a
marketing communications unit
that combines the functions of
the former University Relations
and Graphics, Marketing, and
Printing units; and an expanded
News, Information, and National‘
Media Relations unit which,
among other things, publishes
the Pitt Campaign Chronicle,
established by Hill in October
2000. -

In July 2000, he became
publisher of the University

’ Times.

He also put into place a
three—year' strategic Web site
development initiative. _

Last month, the Council
for Advancement and Support
of Education (CASE) awarded
Public Affairs a Bronze Award for
promoting awareness of the need

to immunize children attending
Pittsburgh city schools.

Hill recently conceived, nar-
rated and was executive producer
of a documentary video on
the African American student
heritage at Pitt; this video is
being used to reconnect Pitt’s
African American alumni and was
cosponsored by the University’s
Ofﬁce of Alumni Relations and
Ofﬁce of Institutional Advance-
ment.

Hill has been an administra-
tor in higher education for 32
years, 21 of them at Syracuse

SHRS gets $4.5 million grant to study

wheelchair safety in motor vehicles

Pitt’s School of Health and
Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS)
last month received a ﬁve—year
$4.5 million grant from the
federal government to study
ways to make motor vehicle
travel safer for the estimated 1.7
million wheelchair users in the
United States. _

Researchers will develop ways
to make traveling by automobile,
van, mini—van and most forms of
public transportation safer for
those who remain seated in their

ﬂwheelchairs while in transit.

The grant, from the U.S.

iDepartment of Education’s

National Institute for Disability
and Rehabilitation Research, will

. establish the new Rehabilitation 1

Engineering Research Center

on VVheelchair Transportation

Safety within the rehabilitation
science and technology depart-
ment of SHRS.

The UniversityofMichigan’s '
Transportation Research Insti-

tute (UMTRI) also will partici-
pate in the study. ,

This grant is the second of
its kind awarded to Pitt. The
previously awarded Rehabilita-
tion and Engineering Research

Center (RERC) grant of $4.5
million focuses on improving
wheeled mobility and seating.

“This grant further estab-
lishes the University of Pitts-
burgh as the primary center for
research to improve wheelchair
technology to meet the needs of
people who use it,” said Clifford
Brubaker, dean of SHRS. “The
collective work of SHRS faculty
contributes to the improve-
ment of safety and utility of
wheelchairs. We believe that this
contributes to quality of life for
the more than a million and a
half people with disabilities in
the US. who use wheelchairs
daily for mobility.”

“Our goalvis to improve the
level of safety and independence
for those using their wheelchair
as a motor vehicle seat,” said Gina
Bertocci, director of RERC at
Pitt. “We will address wheelchair
securement in a vehicle as well
as occupant restraint.”

RESEARCH NOTES

Pitt, VA get
$8 million. to
study
alcohol-HIV
interactions

"Alcohol is the drug most
commonly abused by people
infected with HIV, researchers

"say. To study how alcohol use

and abuse interacts with HIV
infection and treatment, Pitt
and the Pittsburgh Veterans
Administration Medical Center
have received an $8 million grant
from the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
“We know that alcohol and
unprotected sex are common
bedfellows. Alcohol use and
abuse may be an important risk
factor for HIV infection,” said
the study’s principal investiga-
tor, Amy Justice, of Pitt and
the Pittsburgh VA. “Overuse
of alcohol likely aggravates"
common related medical and
psychiatric diseases such as
hepatitis C and depression.
Alcohol use may also decrease
the beneﬁt of HIV treatment by
causing people to miss taking
their medication and increasing
the risk of treatment toxicity.”
An expansion of the ongoing
Veterans Aging Cohort Study
(VACS), the current study will
identify the role of alcohol use
and abuse in’ determining health
and quality of life among aging
veterans with and without HIV.
The study also will examine the

effect alcohol has on susceptibil-
ity to drug toxicity and the
progression of related diseases.
Justice and co-principal inves-
tigatorjoseph Conigliaro, also
of Pitt and the Pittsburgh VA,
will lead the study of 2,000
HIV-infected veterans and 2 ,000
non-HIV-infected, matched
controls from VA facilities in
Manhattan/Brooklyn, Bronx,
Atlanta, Los Angeles and Hous-

ton. At these sites, researchers "

will examine the impact of
alcohol use and abuse on related
diseases, drug toxicity, death,
quality of life, treatment suc-
cess, use of health care services
and prescription drug use and
adherence. ’
The VA’s national electronic
medical records system, which

includes laboratory and phar-

macy data and cantrack patient
status over time, offers unique
advantages for such a long—term
study.

“Because the VA pays for all

currently approved antiretrovi-
ral medications and can track
patients among several clinical
sites,g2ve expect to achieve excel-
lent follow-up on these patients,”
Conigliaro said. “In addition,
patients with HIV infection
in the VA system are predorr1i—
nantly members of important and
understudied minority groups.”

The national VA hospital -

system is the largest single
provider of  services in
the United States, and in 2000

it treated some 18,000 HIV-
infected veterans. ,

Justice is a Robert Wood
Johnson Generalist Faculty
Scholar and associate professor
in the School of Medicine, and
associate professor of health
services research at the Gradu-
ate School of Public Health.
Conigliaro is associate professor
in the medical school. Both are
staff physicians at the Pittsburgh
VA Medical Center.

tumors are very difﬁcult to treat
successfully. Malignant gliomas
make up the majority of primary
brain tumors and are expected to
kill approximately 13,000 brain
cancer patients this year.
Gliomas tend to aggressively
invade the folds and creases of the
brainaround the tumor, making
them difﬁcult or impossible‘ to
completely remove surgically.
Similarly, with standard treat-
ment such as chemotherapy
and radiation, it is difﬁcult to
treat the tumor successfully
without damaging the surround-
ing healthy tissues. Because of the
limitations of standard therapies,
Chambers is exploring gene
therapy—based, immunological
approaches that activate and
maintain the function of the
anti‘-tumor immune response.
“While there is evidence that
immune cells, such as lympho-

cytes, inﬁltrate gliomas, they are

generally ineffective in ﬁghting
the tumor’s growth and develop-
ment,” said Chambers. “Many
analyses have indicated that
the function of lymphocytes is
suppressed in gliomas, as is the
function of the immune system
throughout the body in patients
with gliomas. Our hope is that
we can correct and improve the

function of the immune response -

to these tumors and use this
to target the‘ inﬁltrative areas
of gliomas that are difﬁcult
to eliminate using standard
therapies.”

Chambers will corr_1bine two
therapeutic approaches that indi-
vidually have produced promis-
ing, but limited, results. He pro-
p0sesth.atcoup1ing=th¢ therapies
will create an advantage to either
approach as a single therapy.
The combined approach, called
RICS therapy, or the reversal
of immunosuppression coupled

' with cytotoxic cell stimulation,

attempts to induce an effective
immune response by blocking

- the function of tumor-derived
transforming, growth factor-bi

(TGFb). TGFb is a protein

produced by gliomas that is I

responsible for much of the
immune suppression associated
with these tumors. The approach
also seeks to stimulate cytotoxic
lymphocytes, which include
natural killer (NK) cells and T

correct a rare condition called
keratoconus. Pitt’s ophthalmol-

Keratoconus is a degenerative
disease in which thinning of the
corneal tissue causes the cornea
to swell and bulge forward.

"The disease strikes patients in

their late teens to early 20s
and progresses until the 30s or

405. Patients with keratoconus _'

experience a progressive loss and
distortion of vision, which in
the early stages can be treated
with eyeglasses. Later stages
are corrected with rigid contact
lenses and, in severe cases, a
corneal transplant. .

“By using INTACS to treat

keratoconus, we hope to provide‘

our patients a restorative, option
where we can help improve
corneal shape,” said Deepinder
Dhaliwal,“ chief, of refractive

- surgery at iUPNIC‘—Ey‘e & ‘Ear

Institute. _

The INTACS procedure

involves the implantation of
two arc-shaped plastic inserts
between layers of the cornea.
Previously used in patients with
myopia (near—sightedness), the
procedure ﬂattens the cornea,
making the cornea closer to its
natural shape. .

By mounting pieces of bladder

tissue in “stretch chambers” and.

observing their behavior at the
cellular level during simulated

bladder ﬁlling, the researchers

found that the bladder surface’

area is able to modulate to
accommodate increased pressure
in" a unique way. .Microscopic

compartments called vesicles

both expand to increase surface
area and contract — perhaps to
remove old membrane that has
been damaged by exposure to the
toxic components of urine.

A key role in this process’
is played by a molecule called
cyclic adenosine monopho-
spate, which can regulate surface
area —— in some cases without
even stretching the tissue. The

Gollin, associate professor of ‘

that toxic chemicals in cigarette

the way certain cells prepare

These epithelial cells line
the inside of the mouth and are
called squamous cells. Cigarette
smoke appears to negatively
impact the cells when they

separate their‘ chromosomes.

Researchers hypothesize that this
may lead to a change in chromo-
some structure and contribute
to the types of divisiondefects
seen in cancer cells.

Saunders and his colleagues
targeted the anaphase stage
of cell division, when cellular
chromosomes copy themselves
and move in identical sets to

, opposite poles in preparation for

division into two sister cells. ‘By
exposing these cells to cigarette
smoke condensate (CSC) in
the laboratory, the researchers
observed serious errors in cell
division. Sometimes a single
chromosome was pulled in two
different directions at once to
form a bridge. These anaphase
bridges may be an early precursor

Award for 2001 from Temple University’s Institute on Disabilities.
The award was presented in recognition of the center’s excellence
in providing innovative and consumer-responsive services to

persons with disabilities.

CAT’s mission is to enhance the ability of people with disabilities
to fulﬁll life goals through the coordination and provision of
appropriate services. The center provides services to area residents
with disabilities through a network of health care professionals,
including occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech
language pathologists, audiologists and rehabilitation engineers.

Under the direction of Michael Boninger, the center trains
students and fosters research in assistive technology and rehabilitation
science as well as the design and fabrication of customized

assistive devices.

In addition to providing patients with care, CAT’s’ researchers
are conducting studies on a variety of subjects, including reduction
of pressure ulcers among wheelchair users and telerehabilitation

Happ, who received $800,000
from the National Institute

for her “Ventilator Weaning:
Processes of Care and Com-
munication” study, will focus
on interpersonal interactions,
therapeutic strategies and envi-
ronmental factors that contribute
to weaning success or are associ-

. ated with inconsistent/plateau

weaning from LTMV. Happ said

‘her study will capitalize on a

unique ‘natural laboratory’ to
ﬁll important gaps in the"cur-
rent understanding of advanced

specialty clinician practice in ‘

ventilator weaning.

“During a two—and-a—half
year period, we will work with
approximately 30 patients, family
visitors and clinician caregivers
in a medical intensive care unit
(MICU) and step-down medical
intensive care unit,” said Happ,
who is the principal investiga-
tor for the study. “Because
the MICU is the environment
where weaning from long—term
mechanical ventilation actually
occurs, the real barriers and
successful strategies that are

encountered by patients and cli— ’

nicians will be more evident.”
Happhopes to ﬁnd a thera-

peutic approach that can be

utilized by various members of

the health care team. “Nurses,

physicians, respiratorytherapists, _

and others work together to
achieve successful weaning from
LTMV,” Happ explained. “Since
ventilator weaning is a multidis-
ciplinary process, knowledge
from this study may help those

disciplines work together more

effectively to achieve successful
outcomes in patients ‘weaning

2nd minority

health summit on

racial disparities begins today

Minority health leaders and
scholars from around the United

"States will convene here today

and tomorrow for the Pitt Center
for Minority Health’s second
annual summit on eliminating
racial and ethnic; health dispari-

12168.

The 2002 theme is .“The
Impact of Discrimination on
Health Statusf’ The two—day
summit will be held at the
University Club.

During the summit, the
Center for Minority Health is
expected to announce an initia-
tive to eliminate health dispari-
tiesin the city of Pittsburgh and
Allegheny County.

’ The summit is sponsored by
the Center for Minority Health
at the Graduate School of Public
Health; the Office for Civil
Rights (Region 3),U.S. Depart-
ment of Health andiHuman

Services and the Maurice Falki
‘Medical Fund.

“Our aim is to mount- a

comprehensive response to the
growing body of scientiﬁc evi-
dence that discrimination has
invaded the health care delivery
system,” said Stephen Thomas,
director of the Center for Minor-
ity Health and Philip Hallen

Professor of Community Health

and Social Justice.

“Since'the civil «rights move-
ment in the 1960s, much progress
has been made in addressing
racism in the United States,
but discrimination —- usually
unintentional — still exists in

the provision of health care
services,” Thomas said.

The summit will include
addresses and panel discussions

1 with leading local and national

ﬁgures in minority health.

A press conference will be
held at noon today,Jan. 10, at the
University Club to launch the
Pittsburgh African-American
Health“ Promotion Campaign,

the Center for Minority Health’s ‘
new initiative to build com-

munity capacity to eliminate
racial and ethnic health dispari-
ties in Allegheny County by the
year 2010. ,

Funded by the Lois Tack,
1 Thompson Fund, the Westwood

Fund, and A the O.C. Prickett
and Margaret Prickett Fund of

The Pittsburgh Foundation,‘

the eight—year ‘campaign will
begin with a focuson health
problems highlighted in the
“Black Papers,” a series of health
status, reports released by the
Urban League of Pittsburgh. V
“An honest and open discus-

sion about race and discrimina— .

tion in health care is a critical
ﬁrst step, but rwe are not just
wringing our hands over the
problem,” Thomas said. “VV1th
financial support from The
Pittsburgh Foundation we are
launching a major local campaign
with community partners to
address the issue from the ground
up. Pittsburgh is sure to emerge
as a model city  eliminating
racial and ethnic health dispari-
ties.” ' ' ' I
