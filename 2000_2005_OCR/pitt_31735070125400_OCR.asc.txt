H -»‘‘This made it impossible to
hold our tuition increases_ to a

“During this same period, the

rate of inﬂation was approxi-
mately 3.4 percent, and costs
borne by colleges and universi-
ties rose at an even higher rate.
Faced with the difﬁcult choice of
increasing tuition or abandon-
ing plans to move the University

forward, we chose progress.”

In defending the 7.5 percent
increase, Pitt ofﬁcials cited tu-
ition hikes approved for next fall
at several peer institutions. They
included Ohio State University
(9.3 percent), Indiana Univer-
sity and Purdue University (7.5
percent at each school) and the
University of Illinois (14.7 per-
cent. for new students and 4.6
percent for returning students).

the nation in public university

Hampshire ($6,493), according

Chancellor Mark Nor-

coming weeks how the 4 per-

among four components:
cost.-of-living (defined by
Pitt’s salary policy as “main—
tenance of real salary for sat-
isfactory performance”),
merit, and centrally allocated

Nordenberg won’t lack
for advice on how to- spread
the money around.

and Budgeting Committee
(U PBC) —- an advisory group
of faculty, staff, administra-
tors and students, chaired by

‘Provost James Maher —— has
submitted two plans for dis-
tributing salary funds to fac-
ulty and staff.

Half of UPBC’s members
recommended splitting the 4
percent as follows: 2.5 per-
cent for maintenance of real
salary for satisfactory perfor-
mance, 1 percent for merit,
and 0.5 percent_ for market
andequity raises. (A faculty
group, the University Senate
budget policies committee,
recommended this same split
but limited its proposal to
faculty salaries.) .

An equal number of
UPBC members supported
the following split: 2 percent
for maintenance of real sal-
ary for satisfactory perfor-
mance, 1 .5 percent for merit,
and 0.5 percent for market
and equity. _

The Senate committee
noted that a 4 percent in-
crease in the salary budget
won’t be enough to meet all
of Pitt’s salary goals, given
that last year’s inﬂation rate
was 3.4 percent. “Nor is it

‘ likely to enhance the com-
petitiveness of Pitt’s salaries
or enable progress toward our
goal of average salaries of at
least the median for each rank
of our peer institutions in the
Association of American
Universities,” the Senate
committee wrote.

New director of CLAS hopes to

increase faculty research grants

 

itt’s Center for Latin
American Studies
(CLAS) can boast of

an international reputation, well-
established research_ programs
and an endowment that has
grown from $600,000 to $7 mil-
lion in the last eight years.
“I don’t think there’s any-
thing that needs to be ﬁxed at
CLAS,” says Kathleen M.
DeWalt, who will become the
center’s new director effective
July 1. “We’re in the position,
thanks to our relatively good
economic base, to focus on main-
taining and enhancing our posi-
tion as an intellectual force, 10-

cally and regionally as well as

nationally and internationally.”

CLAS ‘awards $50,000-
$75,000 annually in research
grants to faculty. DeWalt hopes
to increase that. “One of the rea-
sons for building up our endow-
ment over the last few years has
been to stabilize funding for cut-
ting-edge faculty research,” she
said. “We’re in a position now
where we can invest more money
in that, as well as in student re-
search.”

DeWalt’s other goals include
organizing high-proﬁle confer-

DeWalt, a fellow cultural an-

William Brustein, director of

the University Center for Inter-

for the head of an elite center
such as CLAS to succeed his or
her own spouse. “The fact is that
these are two intellectual power-
houses who have their own pro-
fessional agendas. Kathleen was
nominated by the faculty and
widely supported, based on her
own very strong scholarly and
leadership merits.

“Bill DeWalt was a wonder-
ful director, and Kathleen has

Caregiving helps spouse cope with
partner’s death, Pitt study shows

New Pitt research suggests

. that people who care for their

sick spouses cope betterwhen
their partner dies than those who
take no role in caregiving, and
they have a lesser chance of de-
pression, weight loss and poor
health. _

The study by Richard Schulz,

professor of psychiatry, epide— '

miology and sociology, andihis
colleagues is the ﬁrst to clearly
show that the way married

couples cope with the death of a A

spouse varies depending on how
active" they were with caring for
their dying partner. The research
was published in ,th‘e'June 26
Journal of the American Medi-
cal Association OANIA). A

“While caregivers can be-
come depressed after the death
of their spouse, in many ways the
death can actually bring relief
from some of the more demand-
ing_tasks of caregiving,” Schulz
said. “Death also brings an end

to their partner’s suffering and

allows them to get back into a
more normal routine.” »

‘ Partners who have a limited
role or no participation in
caregiving may take the death
harder because it is less expected,
said Schulz. If the deceased
spouse had not been ill, the sur-
vivor also suffers the loss of an
active life partner. _ ’ ~

Schulz’s study shows that,

non—care givers have a higher risk
for negative health consequences

such as weight loss, increased.

depression and increased medi-
cation use.

According to Schulz, the
study takes on a greater meaning
considering that most deaths in
the United States today are pre-

» ceded by an extended period of
illness and disability. As the

population ages, family mem—
bers will be called upon to pro-
vide support and care to relatives
before they die. It also suggests

that clinicians andjfamily mem— '
“ bers need to understand the role

of caregiving and how it affects

bereavement to help them bet- '

ter meet the survivor’s needs.
Schulz said, “During the next
15 to 20 years there will be more
people hitting their 70s and 803
than ever before, increasing the
burden of care on relatives.”

Researchers followed 819.

married men and women ages 66
to 99‘for four years. During that
time, 129 individuals were wid—,
owed. Survivors were classiﬁed
as non-caregivers, caregivers
who reported no strain, or
strained caregivers. I
Individuals classified as
strained caregivers before the
death of their spouse tended to
cope much better with the death

than-those who. had a less active
role. Researchers outlined sev-
eral reasons: Death is more pre-
dictable so individuals can better
prepare for it; death brings an
end to patient suffering as well—as

an end to demanding caregiving '

tasks; death is a relief to both
patient and caregiver; and, be-
cause caregiving demands dis-
rupt normal routines, death en-
ables the former caregiver to re-
turn to normal activities.
Shock and disruption sur-
rounding a spouse’s death were

the two most likely reasons for "

increased depression and poorer
health in general for those with
limited or no caregiving roles. Z

Work began yesterday, June
27, on the ﬁrst of a series of
Homewood lead abatement
projects "co-sponsored by UPMC
Health System.

A joint effort of the UPMC
Community Initiatives program,
the Homewood Healthy Homes
Collaborative (HHHC), the Al-

legheny County Department of :

Health and other local ‘agencies,
the Homewood lead abatement
project hopes to. help prevent
the effects of lead ‘poisoning in
children under 6.

HHHC plans to ‘host three

free lead screenings a year; sub- \

mit 5-10 applications a month to

for lead abatement; abate 1-3
homes per month, and work to
certify at least ﬁve contractors
and 30 workers in lead abate-
ment procedures.

According to Herber't L.
Needleman, professor of psy-
chiatry at the School of Medi-

 Lead abatement project started

cine and an authority on lead
poisoning, -“The major source of

lead poisoning in children is‘

household paint, and many older
Pittsburgh neighborhoods have

homes with deteriorating lead

paint.” .
- In the past year, HHHC held
a Lead Awareness Day, involv-

ing community nurses from

UPMC, medical students from
the School of Dental Medicine

and other health care providers 0

and community partners. About
40 children were tested. ‘

The Centers for Disease
Control estimates that '4.4 per-

, cent of children aged 1-5 have

long intellectual and behavioral
effects. I

more generous with direct ﬁ-
nancial aid to students than in
subsidizing state—supported uni-
versities.

Even with a tuition increase
that is double last year’s inﬂation
rate, Pitt remains “a very good
value in the higher education
marketplace,” according to
Nordenberg.

“In developing this budget,
we did"take_into account the fact
that applications to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh have increased

by nearly 100 percent since 9
‘ 1995,” the chancellor said. “We

have, in a systematic way, gener-
ated feedback from potential stu-
dents, from current students and
their parents, in an effort to de-
termine the things that inﬂu-
ence students to come to Pitt.
Nothing has been more impor-
tant than the perception that Pitt
is an institution that’s commit-

‘ ted to delivering a high-quality

education.” _

Nordenberg said the admin-
istration does not expect next
fall’s tuition hike to affect «stu-
dent applications or retention.

Under the proposed FY 2 002

"budget, the largest increases in

expenditures would be for fac-
ulty and staff compensation
($625.8 million, up by $39.7
million) and student aid ($80.3
million, a $6.imillion increase).

The budget also includes $8.1
million in student life and aca-
demic program enhancements
(up by $1 million), $9.5 million

in research incentive, programs

:'(a' $600,000 increase) and" $3 .1’

million to cover increased utili-
ties costs as well as operating
expenses for new facilities such
as the Petersen Events Center.
The University’s $500 n1il—
lion capital campaign, publicly
launched last fall, won’t impact
the FY 2002 operating budget,
Nordenberg said. “Certainly, the
capital campaign will be an im-
portant source of ﬁnancial sup-
port over time,” he said. “In many
cases, contributions will create
endowments that will provide
[ﬁscal] relief. But we’re still col-
lecting on pledges at this time.”
Nor will Pitt’s operating bud-
get be affected next year by dis-
tribution.of Pennsylvania’s $11

among institutions for 
funding last year.

' About $65 million in tobacco
settlement money is expected to
go to Pennsylvania universities
and research facilities next year.

Nordenberg said: “We are
very pleased that Pennsylvania’s
tobacco settlement funds will be
invested in human‘ health, and‘
that the agreement reached in
Harrisburg provides for signiﬁ-

, cant investments in medical re-

search. We expect that many of
the important programs here at
the University will enjoy new
forms of support through the
distribution" of tobacco settle-
ment dollars. But those dollars
won’t impact on our budget for

next year.” i

UPMC &
Pitt propose
$600 million
expansion of
medical area

‘ planned $600 mil-
lion transformation
of Oakland’s medi-

cal campus would construct three
new buildings, connect existing
facilities and make the three-
block complex more accessible,
identiﬁable and aesthetically
pleasing, ofﬁcials from UPMC,
Pitt and Children’s Hospital said
this week.

The seven-year project calls
for: ' .

0 Construction of a new, $2 50
million Children’s Hospital on
the UPMC Monteﬁore site and
a $120 million renovation of the
existing Children’s, mainly to
house adult services currently at
UPMC Presbyterian.

° Construction of a $12 0 mil-
lion Pitt biotechnology center
on Fifth Avenue on the site of
the Lhormer Building (between
Lothrop and Darragh streets).

0 An $80 million: UPMC
Monteﬁore ambulatory care fa-
cility.

° New signs, green space and
a 1.2-acre parklike gateway to

the medical campus on the cor- .

ner of Fifth and DeSoto streets,
These improvements are ex-
pected to cost $30 million.

UPMC would fund most of
the project, with Pitt paying$ l 20
million to construct its biotech
center and Children’s contrib-
uting as much as $50 million.

At a June 26 news confer-
ence, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg said the project
would enable Pitt to enhance its
biomedical research and expand
its leadershipin the health sci-
ences. .

“Our research discoveries will
enrich the local biotech indus-
try, thereby promoting regional
economic development while
providing an example of creative
organizational cooperation that
can serve as "a model for other
metropolitan areas,” he said.

The 10-12 story Pitt biotech
center, to be built with Univer-
sity funds, will provide 300,000
additional square feet of research
laboratories. ,

“Within that — structure
...some of the worldismost tal-
ented scientists will focus on such
areas as applied neuroscience,
bioengineering and’ drug discov-
ery,” Nordenbergsaid. .

Pitt currently employs more
than 1,700 full—time Health Sci-
ences faculty members, he noted.
“In the past two years alone, we
have recruited more than 60 ac-
complished faculty‘ members
who have brought with them
established funding programs
‘into Pittsburgh. They’re com-
ing from the best universities in
the country and from abroad.
To recruit even more members
to this group, we need to create
the space in which they can do
theirwork,” the chancellor said.

All of Pitt’s current lab space
is ﬁlled, he pointed out.

dentjeffrey Romoff agreed that;
“There is no way to recruit su-

perb" scientists on the cutting

edge without providing them
laboratory space.”
With the budget of the Na-

tional Institutes of Health  '

projected to double in the next
ﬁve years, the addition of high-
quality researchers and lab space
should earn Pitt and UPMC a

disproportionate share of NIH -

funds, ofﬁcials said. Pitt’s medi-
cal school ranks 10th in the coun-

try in NIH funding.

Nordenb_erg said Pitt’s ad-
ministration’ has consulted with
architects on preliminary design
of the biotech center. “We have

also been worldng  our

~ own faculty groups to determine

what would makethe most sense

in use of that space,.and clearly,

we’re thinking hard about ways
we will fund it.” e ’

_ Ideally, Pitt will break ground
on the center “in the next year or
so, ” with construction to be com-
pleted two-and-a—half years af-
ter that, Nordenberg said.

Groundbreaking for the new

Children’s Hospital is slated for ‘

late fall, with completion of the
facility by 2 005 . Children’s Hos-
pital President and CEO Ronald
L. Violi said the new facility will
be the ﬁrst “100 percent green”

through improved efﬁciency in
design, Violi said. Much of the
new space already is spoken for
by clinicians who currently are
forced to work at sites away from
the hospital, he said. .
Violi called thecurrent

 Class of 11973 holds ﬁrst Falk School reunion

Falk director Bill ,-

Eighteen
members of the
group staged
the first Falk
School class
reunion this
month.

estled in the rolling

hills on University

Drive, a gray stone
school house .with an Old En-
glish slate shingle roof will mark
its 70th anniversary this Septem-
ber. ’

But on~June 16 Falk School,
the- K-8 laboratory,» school ad-
ministered by Pitt’s School -of

’ Education, was the site of a new
‘ event, when 18 of the 24 stu-
'_ dents from the class of 1973 gath-
ered from as far as Seattle for the
first reunion in the school’s his-
tory. L '

Counting families and three
retired teachers in attendance for
a tour, a-meal and an eveningof

reminiscing, the event drew 40
people. Doubling as a fund-
raiser, the reunion raised more

than $7,000 in donations from

the class.

« Falk director Bill McDonald, 

who has been on staff at the
school for nearly half its exist-

ence, called the reunionone of .

the most satisfying experiences

of his 33-year educational‘ ca-

reer. .
.“There are rewards for being

ateacher: Seeing your students

become successful is one of the

best,” McDonald said. “But for

me, to have a group come back
on their own and hear them say

things about established life—long

 

friendships, and what their Falk
experiences meant to them, gives
you a pride that it wasall worth-
while.” ’ '
Still at its original location,
the Fanny Edel Falk Elementary
School opened in 1931 with 78
students. At that time the school
offered nursery-. school .to 6th
grade. The school was-funded by
a gift from Pitt benefactors Leon
Falk Jr. and his sister, Marjorie
Falk Levy-, in memory of their
mother. 1
.. The original charter desig-
nated the school as “a progres-
sive experimental and demon-
stration school.” Later, practice
teaching, the development of in-

O

I

novative educational practices,
in-service training and educa-
tional research were added to its
functions. 1

Today, some 2 80 students are
enrolled in grades K-8. Classes
at Falk are mixed-age, matching
students of similar academic
abilities. Students typically re-

main in the same classroom with '

the same teacher for two or three
years, which fosters close rela-
tionships, McDonald said.
Former classmates who at-
tended the June 16 reunion ech-
oed that last sentiment.
. Alan Levenson, chief econo-
mist at TR Price, said, “I was
impressed with the deep trust

that obviously accrued among us
during those many and forma-
tive years at Falk. There are few
pleasures greater than the return
to the bosom of childhood
friendship. It was like returning
.to'an ancient holy site. I "found
myself pressing my palm to the
wide wood banisters, curling my
ﬁngers around the gratings and
_ fences. I could" revive and pre-
serve the feelings and recollec-
tions of my years at Falk.” _ _
One of the reunion’s orga-
nizers, PennyMateer, said, “One
of the most important features
of Falk is the cultural diversity of
students. The teachers, did a
wonderful job of encouraging the
students to learn together and

respect each other. We ‘were,

there during the ’60s. We dis-
cussed issues of race and culture.
We celebrated one another. We
have a very close bond and we
just pick up where we left off. It’s
almost a familial bond.”

Grace Chiang, vice president
of Holt Architects, of Ithaca,
New York,‘ and daughter of
Shiao-Hung Chiang, professor
emeritus in Pitt’s Department of
Chemical Engineering, said, “I
think that the continuous learn-
ing environment at Falkin which
we each progressed at our own

pace encouraged a great deal of
self—motivation, initiative and in-
dependence, which has helped
each of us be successful in our
diverse and individual pursuits.”

A She added that the class of
’73 teemed with successful ca-
reer stories, including three at-
torneys,‘ three professors, a so-
cial work counselor,‘ a nuclear
physicist, an investment banker
turned gemolbgiist, two com-
puter programmers and an
economist.

Architect Chiang said, “I re-
gard my days there as largely
responsible for the high quality
of my early education and for the
wonderful memories of my for-
mative years.”

Mateer said, “VVhat surprised
me most is that the school has
hardly changed since Iwas there
-— that was a bit scary. Some
classrooms have been added and
others have moved, but the build-
ing andits furnishingslookmuch
the same, actually are the same
and need attention. Remember
some of us haven’t been there for
28 years.” 1

T_he reunion won’t be the last
time this group swaps reminis-
cences. Chiang said that the class
was committed to. staying in
touch. “This past-year or so we
have all been communicating via
e-mail. Our classmate Eric Gey-
ser set up a site for us and we all
have been actively and frequently
participating in it to communi-
cate with one another.”

How Pitt stacks up

Librarians’ salaries lowest among public   AAU/ARL members    

the departures last year of sev-
eral senior librarians, including
the retirements of two assistant
directors of the University Li-

ast year, the average sal-
ary of a Pitt librarian

L ($45,200) was the low-

est among librarians at the 32

public universities that are mem-
bers of both the Association of
American Universities (AAU)
and the Association of Research
Libraries (ARL). ‘ '
That was down from 28th
place the year before.
Including private as well as
public AAU/ARL members, Pitt
ranked 54th out of 5 5 universi-
ties in librarians’ average salaries
—— down from 46th place the
previous year. _
Pitt’s fallin rank among its
peers can largely be attributed to

brary System (ULS), said Rush
G. Miller, Hillman University
Librarian and ULS director.

But even without the loss of
such comparatively highly paid
personnel, ULS’s salaries still
would rank low amongAAU and
ARL schools, Miller said.

And that’s despite the fact
that salary raises for ULS’s 56
librarians last year averaged 6.65
percent, the third-highest raise
percentage for any Pitt unit, ac-
cording to the University’s Of-
ﬁce of Institutional Research.

“One of the reasons that our
salaries are low, compared with
our peers, is that we hire entry-
level librarians. We do that be-
cause we have a school [the
School of Information Sciences]
that produces new librarians
right here on campus,” Miller
said. “Most ARL libraries do not
hire anyone without five or 10
years of experience. They have
to pay a lot more to get those
people.” ,

The starting salary of a ULS
librarian is about $3 0,000, Miller
said. I

As a part of its annual plan-
ning document, ULS submitted
to the Provost’s office in March

a three-year plan for raising Pitt
librarians’ salaries to the ARL

' median. The plan calls for an
average salary increase of $5 , 1 39
per librarian over three years,
Miller said- _

Miller said he hasn’t received
feedback from the Provost’s of-
free yet. “VVhether we can move
ahead with it depends on the '
overall funding situation of the
University,” he said.

Pitt’s budget for next year is
outlined in a story on page 1.

Miller said ULS’s proposal is
modeled after a plan at the Uni-
versity of Colorado. “In 1997,
Colorado ranked 91st in the
ARL,” he said. “Today, theyrank

2 7th. And they diditwith a three-
year incremental plan like the
one that we’re proposing.” g
Last year, average librarians’
salaries at Pitt ranked 96th

among 112 ARL schools.

The comparison of Pitt li-
brarians’ salaries with those of

their AAU/ARL peers appeared
in a report released last week by

_the Office of Institutional Re-

search. ,

The report also compared
average salaries of Pitt full, asso-
ciate and assistant professors with

those of their peers in the AAU. -

UCIS   to introduce global studies certiﬁcate program

raditionally, Pitt has
been strong in inter-
national area studies

programs. But what about stu-
dents who are motivated by is-
sues that cross regional borders?

Beginning in fall term 2001,
Pitt will offer those students a
new undergraduate certiﬁcate in
global studies.

Provost James Maher ‘ap-
proved the Global Studies Pro-
gram last week. It will be admin-
istered by the University Center
for International Studies (U CIS).

William Brustein, director of
UCIS, said, “We’re (strong in
_four major regions of the world
— but what about people whose

interests are in the Middle East
or Africa or Oceania, and there’s
not an area studies program for
them? Global studies is a way to
bring them in.” '

UCIS houses four interna-
tionally recognized area studies
components, the Asian Studies
Program and the centers for
Latin American studies, ‘West
European studies and Russian
and East European studies. It
also is home to one of only 10
European Union centers in the
United States.

But there are many issues that
cross regional areas and include
the role of the United States,

such as the global economy, the

environment, world politics and
technology, Brustein said.

“It’s great we’re moving in
this direction. In international
studies, a lot of people are moti-
vated; primarily by a global or
transnational issue, such as sus-
tainable development, which is a
key concern to developing coun-
tries who are using their envi-
ronment while developing
economies.”

The preservation of the Bra-
zilian rain forest, the Kyoto pro-
tocols and human rights are other
such examples, he said.

“If you just study human
rights from an area studies per-
spective, can you capture its glo-

bal comparative essence? These
are the issues that transcend
boundaries. VVhat’s motivating
students is not just Asia or an
interest in Europe, it’s the issue.
Global studies is a way of getting
both faculty and students who

(V are driven by a comparative glo-

bal perspective on issues into the
international studies fold,”
Brustein said.

The global studies certiﬁcate
program is tailored to under-
graduates with an interest in one
or more regions of the world and
related regional or global issues
or themes.

Requirements include: ﬁve
global studies courses (including

Introduction to Global Studies),
two courses in one regional con-
centration and two courses in a
thematic concentration, such as
global governance, evolving
identities in the global world and
technology and society. Two
years of college—level foreign lan-
guage proﬁciency also‘ is re-
quired. .

Undergraduates seeking the
certiﬁcate will be encouraged to
enroll in a study or service abroad
program.

Global Studies Program, call 8-

lllevv genetic
risk factor for
susceptibility
to Alzheimer's
identified

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) re—'

searchers at Pitt have singled out
a new genetic risk factor for the
debilitating brain disease that af-
fects four million Americans to-
day and is expected to strike as
many as 14 million during the
next 50 years. .

In a deca.de—long research
study following more than 300
first-degree relatives of 189
Alzheimer’s patients, Pitt re-
searchers identiﬁed a small area
of chromosome 10 that, when
combined with the previously
identiﬁed APOE E4 gene, sig-
niﬁcantly increases a person’s risk
of developing the disease.

This combination of genes
produced a 16-fold increase in
the risk of AD among ﬁrst-de-
gree relatives, researchers said.
By comparison, this effect is
greater than the increased risk of
lung cancer caused by smoking.
These new results are supported
by independent studies of AD

patients and control studies from
Pittsburgh, Boston and Bonn,
Germany.

Study results appear in the
July issue of Molecular Psychia-

“Our ﬁndings may provide
new opportunities for designing
and evaluating treatments that
prevent or delay the onset of
AD,” said George S. Zubenko,
professor of psychiatry at Pitt’s
School of Medicine and adjunct

professor of biological sciences .

at Carnegie Mellon University.‘
Zubenko and his colleagues

studied normal individuals be-

tween the ages of 40 and 75 who »

were ﬁrst-degree relatives of pa-
tients with AD. The subjects
were given standard memory

evaluation tests to be certain they _
had not suffered any cognitive ‘

decline prior to the start of the
study, and then blood samples
were drawn to identify genetic
and biochemical risk factors for
AD and related disorders.
Eighteen people developed
AD after 11.5 years of regular

,follow—up evaluations. Ongoing

assessments of the remainder of

the group and the continuing ’

Telepathology program permits

A telepathology system de-
veloped by UPMC Health Sys-
tem has been found to be an
effective means for a transplant

pathologist workingin a UPMC- '

managed facilityin Palermo, Sic-
ily, to receive real-time consul-
tations from transplant patholo-
gists in Pittsburgh.

In the past year, more than
150 cases have been reviewed
using the static image telepa-
thology system, according to
Yukako Yagi, who reported on
the system at the annual meeting
of the American Telemedicine
Association.

“This rapid and interactive
telepathology system not only
helped to avoid misdiagnoses, it
allowed the on-site pathologist
in Palermo to conﬁrm‘ her im-
pressions and diagnoses with
colleagues in Pittsburgh, thus
improving diagnosis, treatment

and patient care,” said Yagi, di— _

rector ‘of telepathology at
UPMC’s Center for Pathology
Informatics. ,
The Mediterranean Institute
for Transplantation and Ad-
vanced Specialized Therapies
(Istituto Mediterraneo per i
Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta) is a
joint venture of the UPMC

Health System, the Italian gov- »

ernment. and Civico and Cervello
hospitals of Palermo, Sicily. The
hospitals offer liver transplanta-
tion, living related kidney trans-
plantation and hepatobiliary re-
construction and liver resection
operations.

As part of the agreement,
funded by the Italian govern-

, ment under a health reform law,

UPMC manages the facility as it
would an American medical cen-
ter, incorporating the most ad-
vanced technologies.

UPMC pathologists and in-
formation systems experts de-
veloped the telepathology sys-
tem in-house because no com-
mercial system was available to
meet the speciﬁc requirements
of transplant pathologists. The

real-time international consults ’

system allows for real-time
Internet chat, and all interac-
tions are stored to maintain dis-
cussion context when decisions
are made over several days. .

A pathologist’s diagnosis of-
ten determines if an organ trans-
plant or liver resection opera-
tion should proceed, even as the
patient is on the operating room
table. In ' addition, the
pathologist’s report determines
in large part if and how organ
rejection is to be treated by the
transplant team.

With a six—hour time differ-
ence between Pittsburgh and
Palermo — and because organ
transplants can occur at any time

—— it is not uncommon for pa- —

thologists in Pittsburgh to be
notified of cases during off-

hours. As part of the system, each i

pathologist has a specially
equipped home computer and
monitor upgraded to display
images at high resolution as well
as high-end laptops. The system
automatically pages the "consult-
ing pathologist in Pittsburgh. In
Palermo, the .pathologist’s mi-

croscope contains a high-defini-’

tion ‘camera and software that
capture and send images to Pitts-
burgh.

“Given our experience with

this system to date,lI would esti-
mate that up to 85 percent of all
transplant pathology consulta-
tion could be done directly via
the Internet, assuming there are
committed and experienced- us-
er's ‘on either end,” noted An-
thony]. Demetris, professor of

pathology and director of the

division of transplant pathology
at the Thomas E. Starzl Trans-
plantation Institute, who helped
to conceive and develop the sys-
tem. .

The same system recentlywas
installed at the University of
Kyushu in Fukuoka, Japan,
where there is a liver transplant
program. The team also plans to
collaborate with a center in In-
dia. ” , I

RESEARCH NOTES

search for new risk factors is be-
ing supported by research grants
from the National Institutes of
Health, for which Zubenko
serves as the principal investiga-
1201‘.

According to Zubenko, these
ﬁndings may provide new mo-
lecular targets for therapeutic
drug development and will help
researchers design trials involv-
ing subjects who have the great-
est likelihood of responding to
therapy and for whom successful
therapy would have the greatest
impact.

Furthermore, the newly dis-
covered risk locus affects brain
levels of dopamine, the neu-
rotransmitter used by ineufons
that degenerate in Parkinson’s
disease. As a result, the new ﬁnd-
ings may have relevance for both

1. of these common neurodegen-
‘ erative disorders.

’Study looks at
. consequences

of premature
pubertal
development
Timing of puberty is impor-
tant in the healthy psychosocial
development of adolescents.
However, children with prema-
ture adrenarche (PA) experience
puberty at an earlier age, putting

them at risk for future problems. -

Lorah D. Dom, an assistant
professor in Pitt’s School of
Nursing, is studying the rela-
tionship of the changing endo-
crine makeup “of these ‘girls in
early puberty. with emotional/
‘behavior problems or cognitive‘
difﬁculties. _

Dorn’s research, funded by a
$1.5 million, four—year grant
from the National Institutes of
Mental Health, will study 90 six-
to-eight year old girls with PA,
and 90 “on-time” adrenarche
girls. The “Developmental Psy-
chobiology of Premature
Adrenarche” study will examine
factors such as hormone con-
centrations, stage of puberty,
cortisol reactivity, psychologi-
cal variables, IQ_and memory.

' “Ifourearlierpilotstudyﬁnd-
ings are conﬁrmed showing more
emotional/behavioral. problems
and cognitive difﬁculties, this
information may lead to preven-
tion/intervention efforts to re-
duce th_ese difﬁculties affecting
children with.PA,” Dorn said.

Common
prostate cancer
treatment may
cause severe
bone loss
Men may be losing bone at an
alarming rate as a result of a_
commonly used treatment for
prostate cancer, according to
researchers at the UPMC Health
System and Beth Israel Deacon-
ess Medical Center.
, The ﬁndings,publishedinthe
June issue of thejournal of Clini-

cal Endocrinology and Metabo- "

li/sm, suggest that gonadotropin—
releasing hormone agonists
(GnRH-a), a frequently used

' treatment for prostate cancer,

causes severe drops in bone mass
and results in an increased risk of
fracture in men.

“We were surprised to ﬁnd
that men who were treated with
GnRH-a for prostate cancer ex-
perienced up to a decade’s worth

of bone loss within the ﬁrst year _

of therapy,” said senior author
Susan Greenspan, a professor
in the Pitt medical school’s De-
partment of Medicine and direc-
tor of UPMC’s Osteoporosis
Prevention and Treatment Cen-
ter.

GnRH-a works by depriving
the body of testosterone, an ‘an-
drogen hormone that increases
the growth of prostate tumors.
However, testosterone also is
essential to maintaining bone
mass in men. While doctors have
been using GnRH-a for more
than a decade in treating men
with late—stage metastatic pros-
tate cancer, they have begun us-
ing it more recently in men with
earlier—stage disease and for
longer periods of time. _

Greenspan said: “With close
to 2 00,000 men being diagnosed
with prostate cancer each year,
we could be facing an enormous
increase in the incidence of de-
bilitating bone fractures in men. ”

Prof hopes to
expand, skills
of stroke
survivors’
caregivers

Many people are suddenly.

thrust into a care giving rolewhen
someone in their family suffers a
stroke. Family members must

’ rapidly assimilate a tremendous

amount of information and ac-
quire new skills to meet the needs
of the stroke survivor. At the
same time, they must adhere to
healthy habitsthat preserve their
own-health and well-being.
With a three—year grant from
the National Institute“”’s"E')fI-Tea’ltli'7
National Institute of Nursing
Research,Judith T. Matthews,
assistant professor at the School
of Nursing, hopes to expand the
repertoire of problem-solving
skills for - family caregivers of
stroke survivors and persuade
them to maintain optimalhealth.
Matthews, who has an exten-

' sive background in community
health nursing, says her study, -

“Use of Technology With
Caregivers of Stroke Survivors,”
is geared toward promoting com-
petencies in the family caregiver

.— often a spouse or an adult

child. _

“B ecause shorter hospitaliza-
tions severely reduce the oppor-
tunity for in—hospital prepara-
tion for the caregiving role, fam-
ily caregivers often view them-
selves as lacking requisite knowl-

 edge, skill and support to handle

this’ new responsibil_ity,_”'
Matthews said. “Not only must
they grapple with learning new
competencies, family caregivers

must also deal with their feelings ‘

about how these changes affect
their lives.” '

Matthews plans to offer fam— .
ily caregivers an intervention that '

will include telephone counsel-
ing and web-based information,
health promotion, and peer and
professional support.

Brain studies
show children
from alcoholic
families more
prone to drink
Pitt researchers have discov-
ered-that adolescents from fami-

lies with a history of alcohol de- ~

pendence have differences in
their brains. that make them
prone to alcohol abuse before

they ever touch a drink.

The research_team, headed
by Shirley Y. Hill, professor of
psychiatry, psychologyand hu-
man genetics at Pitt’s School of
Medicine, studied adolescents

-who averaged 17 years of age

from families with multigenera-
tional alcohol dependence to see
if they had morphological
changes in their brains that could

‘make them susceptible to alco-

hol abuse. Through brain imag-
ing, Hill found changes in the
amygdala, a_ walnut—sized struc-
ture in the brain that helps con-
trol basic emotions. Children
from families with a history of
alcohol abuse had reduced right
amygdala volume compared with
children from families with no
abuse.

“The effect on the amygdala I

is significant because the
amygdala is part of an important
reward circuitthat has been im-
plicated in addictive behavior
including cocaine use, gambling

‘and, now, familial alcohol de-

pendence. This circuit is one of
the fundamental components of
the brain’s reward systems and
appears to be important in the
reinforcing actions of. repeated
drug andialcohol abuse,” Hill
explained.

VVhy the right amygdala in
particular is affected is‘ not
known, but perhaps a faster rate
of growth in the right brain ver-

sus left brain during-childhood"

and’ adolescence makes it more
likely that developmental lags in
growth in this area may show up
more prominently on the right
side. - i .

velopment for some of the ado-
lescents catches up by adulthood.
Nevertheless, they are more vul-
nerable as teens. We have found
in our studies that teens from
families with a history of alcohol
dependence begindrinking ear-
lier. This pattern in such a vul-
nerable group of teens can set up

i a pathway toward alcohol de-

pendence lasting into or even
through adulthood,” Hill said.
“Additionally, there is evi-
dence that the brains of teenag-
ers may be more susceptible to
the negative consequences of
heavy alcohol consumption, ” she

said. “Our research shows that, .

in kids from families with a his-
tory of alcohol dependence, some
of these changes actually appear
before they start drinking, which
points to a strong genetic inﬂu-
ence.” '

Hill’s research was supported
by the National Institute of Al-
cohol Abuse -and Al_coholism_.
Study results were published in
the June 5 issue of Biological

' Pitt researchers have success-
fully used stemicell tissue engi-
neering to restore deﬁcient ure-
thral sphincter muscles in ani-
mal models, according to a study
presented this month at the 96th
Annual Meeting of the Ameri-
can Urological Association
(AUA). Researchers successfully
regenerated viable muscle using
muscle derived stem cells.

“These ﬁndings are exciting
on many levels. First, this is the
ﬁrst time that stem cell tissue
engineering" has been used‘ to
regenerate and restore function
in deficient sphincter muscles.
Secondly, it lays the foundation
for further investigation into
methods of using stem cells to
treat stress urinary inconti-
nence,” said ‘Michael Chancel-

lor, professor of urology and‘

gynecology at Pitt.

Given the proper stimulus, *

stem cells have the ability to di-
vide for indeﬁnite periods and
differentiate into a variety of dif-
ferent cells, including muscle.
Researchers have been using this
information to investigate the
theory that it is possible to re-
generate injured tissue through
the injection of stem cells. I

Urinary incontinence affects
13 million Americans. Those
with stress urinary incontinence
involuntarily lose urine while
doing activities that put stress on
the abdomen, such as laughing,
sneezing, coughing, lifting or
walking. A result of damage to
the urethral sphincter, stress in-
continence is most often caused
by childbirth, menopause or pel-
vic surgery. \

blood ﬂow to the brain  im-
prove the typically poor progno-
sis of patients with stroke symp-
toms from arterial blockages that
occur in the rear of the brain,
according to a study published

, in the June issue of Neurosur-

gery. . A
The ﬁndings suggest that
stents, small metallic cages in-
serted into the basilar or verte-
bral arteries (located in the back
of the neck), of these patients
after they have undergone
angioplasty to clear away block-
age (stenosis), may be an alter-
native treatment to bypass sur-
gery or angioplasty alone.
“These strokes are difﬁcult

A ' to treat. Blockage of these arter-

ies portends a poor prognosis for
patients,‘ with 5 to 11 percent
experiencing irreversible neuro-
logical deterioration or death,”
said Michael Horowitz, associ-
ate professor in Pitt’-s Depart-

“ -1_nent of Neurological Surgery.
“Our study results demonstrate‘

that stent-assisted angioplasty is

. an option for "high-risk surgical '

patients.”_
For sur 'cal mana ement of
81 E

‘basilar or vertebral artery steno-

sis, the combined mortality and
morbidity rate is 34 percent,
while angioplasty of these arter-

' ies without stenting leads to

restenosis in 20 to 30 percent of
patients.

_ The retrospective study, by
Pitt and the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center,

" examined the outcomes of 11
» patients with stroke symptoms

who underwent angioplasty and
stenting of either the vertebral
or basilar arteries. All of the pa-
tients in the study had transient
ischemic attacks, or ﬁxed deﬁ-

cits that failed to respond to
medical treatment.'Their symp-
toms included headache, facial

droop, loss of coordination, ver-

tigo and depressed mental sta-

0.18.

After a follow-up period of
four months, seven of the pa-
tients no longer had recurrent
symptoms, lived at home and
resumed activities at the same or
better levels compared with be-_

fore the procedure. ..

The remaining four patients
died either from complications
during the procedure or several
months after the procedure. Two
of the four patients experienced
a fatal rupture of the vertebral or
basilar artery, the third_ha_d a
stroke and died three months
later, and the procedure on the
fourth patient resulted in brain
death. « ‘ —

“Although this study demon-
strates the potential for stent—.
assisted angioplasty, it_ also dem-
onstrates the risks associated with
dilation of stenotic, often frag-

ile, diseased vessels,” said
Horowitz. *“,Long—term follow-
up is needed to determine
whether this treatment will im-
prove on thetnatural history of
the disease with medical man-
agement alone.”

Older women
less‘ likely to
get breast
cancer if they ,
have high hone
density,-— study

  s

Investigators"  '

Graduate School — of Public
Health have found that older
‘women with high bone mineral
density (BMD) are nearly three
times as likely to develop breast
cancer as are older women with
low BMD, and that their tumors
tend to be at an advanced stage at
diagnosis.’
Results of the study are pub-
lished in the June 20 issue _of the
_ Journal of the National Cancer
Institute. This study conﬁrms a
smaller Pitt study that was pub-
lished in the Journal of the
American Medical Association
in 1996.

_ “This study shows that there
is an inverse relationship between
osteoporosis and invasive breast
cancer, two of the most common
and important conditions affect-
ing an older woman’s health,”
saidjane Cauley, associate pro-
fessor. of epidemiology and study
co-author. “The results suggest

that bone mineral density is one I"

of the most powerful predictors
of breast cancer, especially ad-
...-.vanced breast cancer, among eld-
erly women.” _.
Investigators stress that high
.BMD itself is not the cause of
a breast cancer, but a marker for
hormone levels, and that women
_ should not discontinue their ef-
forts to maintain bone mass
through diet or medication.
“Sex steroid hormones, like
testosterone and estrogen, or
other growth promoting hor-
- mones, may be the link to breast
cancer,” said Cauley, “and BMD
may reﬂect a woman’s long-term
exposure to these hormones.
Further studies are needed to
identify the common denomi-
nator.” o

Results from a study led by
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute (UPCI) researcher
Dong Moon Shin suggest that
treating head and neck cancer
patients with a combination of
the biologic agents retinoid, in-
terferon and vitamin E may lead
to improved survival for patients
with a locally advanced stage of

’ the disease and result in few nega-

tLveside..effects..-.  ..  ,.. . 
_Study results were published
in the June 15 issue of the Jour-
nal of Clinical Oncology. ‘
The phase II, study focuses on
patients with squamous cell car-

. cinoma of the head and neck

(SCCHN), which has a low ﬁve-
year survival rate after standard
treatment including surgery, ra-
diation therapy or both surgery
and radiation.

More than two—thirds of pa-
tients with SCCHN are diag-
nosed with stage IH or IV can-
cer, which represent advanced
stages of the disease, and are at
high risk for disease recurrence
or the development of second
primary tumors (SPTs).

“Given the poor survival rates
from head and neck cancer, the
study’s overall survival rates of
98 percent at one-year follow-
up and 91 percent at two-year
follow-up are very promising
indications of the potential of
this treatment for patients with
loca‘lly-advanced=»hea-d and neck
cancer,” said Sh-in, professor of
medicine and otolaryngology at
Pitt’s School of Medicine and
co-director of UPCI’s Head and
Neck Cancer Program.

Head and neck cancer occurs
in the oral cavity, pharynx, lar-
ynx, paranasal sinuses, nasal cav-
ity and the salivary glands, and
accounts for 5 percent of all can-
cers diagnosed ‘in the United

States. Nearly 45,000 cases of

head and neck cancer are diag-
nosed annually -in the United
States, and 13,000 die from
causes related to this disease.
Survival rates have not improved

‘signiﬁcantly over the past 20

years and are among the lowest
compared to other major can-

Pitt leads
national study
on treating
patients with.
diabetes, heart
disease

Recruitment has begun at 14
out of an expected 40 centers for
a_ monumental study that will
determine the best way. to treat
patients who have early coro-
nary artery disease (CAD) and
type 2 diabetes. CAD is the No.
1 killer of people with type 2
diabetes. ' '

Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH) is coor-
dinating the study, which re-
ceived a grant of more than $52 .2
million from the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute, $4.2

million from the National Insti- 7

tute of Diabetes and Digestive &

Kidney Diseases and $15 mil-

lion from Glaxo Smith Kline.
Known as the Bypass

Angioplasty Revascularization '

Investigation 2D (BARI 2 D), the
study is comparing the effective-
ness of various therapeutic regi-

. mens in reducing the number of

deaths from CAD_among type 2
diabetics. Investigators aim to
determine whether aggressive
drug therapy is more effective
alone or in combination with
surgery in reducing mortalityin
this population.

“The percentage of Ameri-
cans who have been diagnosed
with diabetes has doubled over
the last 2 0 years, and that trend is
expected to continue, partially
due to the increase in obesity
and sedentary lifestyles,” said
Katherine Detre, professor of

, epidemiology and director of the

Epidemiology Data Center at
GSPH, and principal investiga-

tor of the study. “The latest ﬁg--

ures ‘show that 6 to 10 percent of
American adults ages 45 and
older are diagnosed diabetic,”
she said. “However, it is believed
that another 6 to 10 percent of
American adults are diabetic but
are unaware of it.”

In type 2 diabetes, the body is
unable to properly use insulin --
a hormone needed to metabo-
lize simple sugars. Such insulin

resistance is a major risk factor '

for cardiovascular disease.
“Diabetics develop heart dis-

ease earlier than do non—diabet- '

ics and have lower survival rates,”
said David Kelley, professor of
medicine in the Division of En-
docrinology andMetabolism and
study co-principal investigator.

“Some 90 to 95 percent of the _ '

world’s. diabetic patients have
type 2, and 80 percent of them
are overweight. Obesity appears
to trigger the onset of this form
of the disease.”

. With the help of 2,800 vol-
unteer participants, the study will
answer two questions that are
critical to ‘type 2 diabetic pa-
tients with stable coronary ar-

‘ tery disease: 1) Underwhat cir-

cumstances is it best to undergo
revascularization in addition to
drug therapy? 2) Which method
of drug therapy is best at con-
trolling glucose? ’

BARI 2D is a followup to
BARI, a study involving patients
with more severe CAD. . Detre
reported on the resultspf BARI
in a recent issue of the New En-
gland Journal of Medicine. I

quantum computation center

Using today’,s fastest comput-
ers, calculating the prime num-
bers of a 400—digit number would
take longer than the age of the
universe. Using quantum com-
puters, in theory, the calculation
would take less than a second.

“Quantum computers are not
simply faster computers,” said
Jeremy Levy, Pitt assistant pro-
fessor of physics and astronomy.
“They exploit the fundamental
laws of quantum mechanics to

enable staggering speed-ups of T

certain kinds of calculations.”
Quantum computers would
be capable of massive parallel
calculations. A traditional com-
puter bit can take on only two
values, 0 or I. By contrast, a
quantum bit can be in a superpo-
sition of both 0»and _l.
. The promise of ultra-fast

computing is why _-the Defense ~

Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA), U.S. Depart-

ment of Defense, has‘ funded a -
- new Pitt research center to de-

velop the core technologies nec-
essary to create quantum com-

puters.

The ﬁve-year, $5.8 million '

effort will fund the Center for
Oxide-SemiconductorMaterials
for Quantum Computation,
which will develop the quantum

‘mechanical equivalents of the .

transistors and bits of traditional

_ computers. The center is a multi-

institutional, international effort
involving ﬁve universities and
three national laboratories.
According to Levy, who will
direct the center, the task of fac-
toring numbers into primes
forms the basis of the encryption
schemes used on the Internet.
Quantum computers, if they can
be built, would be powerful
enough to crack the codes that
protect -the security of individu-
als; corporations and govern-
ment agencies on the Internet.
“Quantum computers are the
‘atom bomb’ of information
technology,” said Levy. “If this
technology is feasible, the entire
infrastructure for secure com-
munication will have to be over-

hauled.” A I

CGS plans e-commerce program

Pitt’s College of General
Studies will launch a noncredit
certiﬁcate program in electronic
commerce this September.‘

The program is aimed at

implement and manage the use
of the Internet to transact busi-
ness.

The certiﬁcate in e-com-
merce management is a part—t:ime
six-course program. Expected to
take seven months to complete,
it will cover e—commerce appli-
cations, technology, strategic
planning, security, privacy and

Onthe run? A healthy diet is still
possible, UPMC nutritionist says

In today’s fast-paced world,

many individuals cannot ﬁnd the ,

time to maintain a healthy and
balanced .diet. Eating healthy
while on the run is not easy for
everyone, yet there are simple
changes one can make to pro-
vide for a healthier eating
lifestyle, according to a UPMC
nutritionist.

A common problem for indi-
viduals on the go is that they
have no set mealtime. They may
ﬁnd it hard to keep foods with
them, especially in the warm,
summer months. Leslie Bonci,
director of sports nutrition at

‘the University of Pittsburgh

Medical Center, offers help to
those who can’t ﬁnd the time to
make a drastic change in their
diet. .

“Make a valiant effort to have
one decent meal a day,” says
Bonci. “This includes some kind
of proteinvwith a vegetable or
fruit and a starchy food.” The
protein Bonci suggests can be.

chicken, lean red meat, ﬁsh or '

eggs, while the starch can be
provided by rice, potatoes, pas-
tas, cereals or breads.

Small and frequent meals’-are
more beneﬁcial than large spo-
radic meals, Bonci says. Healthy
snack items include:

0 Small boxes of dried fruit;

° Trail mix of cereal, nuts
and dried fruit; A I

° Sports bars that provide a
mix of carbohydrates, protein
and fat, putting greater empha-
sis on the carbohydrates;

° Peanut butter crackers;

° Yogurt with cereal added;

° Cheese sticks and fruit;

° Raw vegetables such as baby
carrots, radishes, grape tomatoes
and celery sticks. .

For maximum energy, Bonci
recommends eating something
every three to four hours and
keeping well hydrated. The num-
ber of ounces of ﬂuid a person
needs every day is half of the
person’s weight in pounds.

“Keep a water bottle and a
packet of powdered fruit drink

or lemonade with you, and add-
ing water will provide you with a
thirst quenching drink,” she sug-
gests. “It is cost efﬁcient and has
fewer calories than bottled bev-
erages.”

When dealing with fast foods
Bonci says to always avoid, su-
per-sizing meals. “A Big Mac is
well suited with a small order of
French fries, while a hamburger
gives you more leeway to have a
medium order of French fries.‘
Milkshakes from McDonald’s
are a low—fat and tasty alterna-
tive for a snack,” she says.

“Subway sandwiches are great
choices when you go light on the
cheese and mayonnaise. Remem-
ber that eating a hamburger is
ALWAYS healthier than a fried
ﬁsh sandwich. ‘

“To make the adjustment in
your diet easier, make changes
gradually,” adds Bonci. “One
change at a time works better,
such as adding one more meal a
day, or one more glass of ﬂuid. It
is essential to fuel your body to

Have you had a head injury?

 

Do you have difficulty paying attention? Do you find it hard to remember phone numbers

UPMC clinic offers health care

info for international travelers

UPMC Downtown offers a
full—service clinic to counsel in-
ternational travelers on immu-
nizations, antibiotics and health

— care planning for trips.

The UPMC International
Travel Clinic is the only non-

S’ governmental facility of its type

in western Pennsylvania and is
recognized in the National Reg-

ister of International Travel,

Clinics. A complete inventory of
all recommended vaccines is
stocked on-site. I

The wrong “bug” at the
wrong time can ruin anyone’s
dream vacation or highly antici-
pated business trip, according to

. Lawrence D. Ellis, medical di-

rector of UPMC Downtown.
As part of the UPMC Corpo-

rate Health Program, Ellis es-.

tablished the clinic seven years
ago to service corporate as well

as individual clients.

The clinic’s database is up-
dated weekly, using information
from the Centers for Disease
Control, the U.S. Department
of State and the World Health

Organization.

“It is important to understand ,

that each particular country is
interestedinprotectingits people
from what diseases you might
bring to their country,” Ellis said.
“We go beyond that and make
other recommendations to be
sure the patient is protected from

diseases that could potentially

be contracted in each country.
We offer complete patient edu-
cation.”

UPMC’s International
Travel Clinic is located at the
corner of Sixth and Smithﬁeld
streets, Downtown. For more in-

UPMC Health System’s
planned merger with Children’s
Hospital has been challenged by
UPMC’s rival, Highmark, Inc.
In a June 19 antitrust lawsuit

aimed at blocking the merger,
Highmark claimed the move will
stiﬂe competition and drive up
health care costs. _ .1
As a- counter-offer to
UPMC’s, Highmark offered to
build Children’s Hospital a new
facility, if the hospital would
agree to remain independent.
At Tuesday’s news confer-
ence, Romoff called the lawsuit

Architect's rendering of the proposed Child and Adult Ambula-
tory Care Center on Fifth Avenue at Chesterfield Street, a 12-
level outpatient facility. The structure will have access to
Montefiore's imaging and laboratory facilities. The building is
expected to cost $80 million. “

groundless. “We are hopeful, and
strongly believe, that it will fail
and that it will have no effect on

‘ this project,” he said.

4 “UPMC remains 100 percent
committed to open access to all
patients, regardless of their abil-
ity_ to pay, regardless of their
insurance‘ company,” Romoff
added. _ S
The UPMC hospitals’

makeover will not“in and of

itself” lead to higher patient bills,
he said. “I believe that the kinds
of savings and efﬁciencies that
we will be able to bring about by
virtue of themerger ofChi1dren’s
and UPMC will cover a substan-
tial portion of the*[project] costs,”
Romoff said. .
Constru_ction-related “traffic
messes” probably can’t be
avoided, he said. “But one of the
positive things is that the whole
project will be limited to a three-

_ block area. We can control traf-

ﬁc flows and stage construction
better” to minimize congestion,
Romoff said. ’ -
The initial‘ four-year phase of
the project is projected to create
400 construction jobs per year
and another 200 off-site jobs for
people providing goods and ser-
vices‘ to support construction,
according to UPMC.
Allegheny County Chief Ex-
ecutive Jim Roddey, who at-

_‘ tended the news conference (as

did Pittsburgh Mayor Tom
Murphy) called the project “the
single most importanteconomic

. development we could have.”
