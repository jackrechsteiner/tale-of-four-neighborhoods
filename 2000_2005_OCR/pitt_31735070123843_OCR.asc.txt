GSPH’s dean talks about NIH

Mayor defends tax proposals
at Faculty Assembly meeting

ittsburgh’s universities
and hospitals are. vital
“economic engines”
helping to power the local
economy — but they’re not
paying their fair share of taxes
for city services, Mayor Tom
Murphy told a skeptical audience

of about 50 Pitt professors, staff

and administrators at the June 3
Faculty Assembly meeting.

“It is clear that the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and the city
are intertwined, and that you are
very important to the success of
Pittsburgh,” Murphy said. “On
the other hand, there are costs
associated with that [success], and
we’re asking you to help to pay

not increased since 1965. Two
out of -three. jobs (representing
85 percent of total payroll) in
Pittsburgh are held by non-city
residents, Murphy said, yet non-
residents pay just $2 million in
occupation taxes while city resi-
dents pay $49.5 million in wage
and occupation taxes.

° A new 10 percent alcoholic
drink tax. “VVhen you go out to

dinner and you pay the city’s 7 .

percent sales tax on your bill,
it covers just the foo.d, not the
drinks you’ve had,” Murphy
said. ‘-‘That tax doesn’t apply to
alcohol.

. “Bars and restaurants pay a lot
of taxes to the state, but they don’t

Pittsburgh’s current tax
structure “is based‘ on a city that
doesn’t exist anymore,” he said.
“It is based on a city where 60
percent of the people worked in
manufacturing. Fifty years ago,
we had 600,000 people who lived
and worked in Pittsburgh,” com-
pared with today’s city-dwelling
workforce of 335,000. Another
2 70,000 non-city residents com-
mute to Pittsburgh daily to work,
study at the city’s universities and
seek care at its hospitals.

“So, in many ways we still

have a city of 600,000 people,” '
' Murphy said..“But who pays for

the underlying services to support
that has changed remarkably.” ,
Faced with a $60 million

shortfall in the city’s budget for I

the ﬁscal year starting July ‘1
— and a worst-case scenario of
being forced to declare munici-
pal bankruptcy later in the year

—— Murphy is seeking additional '
state aid and a merger of Pitts-

burgh’s ﬁre and emergency medi-
cal services departments.

The mayor also wants the state
General Assembly to approve:

° Anew, 0. 5 percent city “pay—
roll preparation tax” on the gross
payrolls of all Pittsburgh employ-

ers, including non-proﬁt institu— ’
' tions. (It is estimated that this tax

would cost the University $32
million annually, based on Pitt’s
currentpayroll.)Murphypointed
out that 30 percent of proper-
ties in Pittsburgh are occupied
by schools, universities, hospitals
and other non-proﬁt institutions
that pay no city property taxes.
Nor do these institutions pay city
business taxes, the mayor said.

° A hike from $10 to at least
$58 in the annual occupation
tax on city workers, which has

Faculty Assembly members
didn’t argue against the alco-
holic drink tax or increasing the
occupation tax, although some
professors pointed out that the

latter hike would add to the tax

a percentage increase would be

Murphy agreed, but said

Philadelphia, which charges sub-

urbanites a whopping 4 percent A

UNIVERSITY TIMES

An open letter to Nlayor Murphy futon: SAC

Dear Mayor Murphy:

In response to your pro-
posal to tax the University of
Pittsburgh as well as other non-
proﬁt organizations in the City of
Pittsburgh, we would like to draw
your attention to some economic
history of the region. The City
of Pittsburgh and surrounding
region has morphed from a
highly industrialized economy

_ to one driven by technology and

ideas. The main reason that the
region has been able to adjust to
a new economy driven by tech-
nology can be directly attributed
to non—profit organizations such
as the University of Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Mellon University and
Duquesne University. Pittsburgh
now has a global recognition, not
as a city that makes steel, but to
quote President Bush, as “Knowl-
edge Town.” Pittsburgh has the
6th largest grouping of educa-
tion and research activity in the
United States with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh alone receiving
more than $433 million in outside
sponsored research funding (FY
2002). Corporations once gener-
ated the most patent activity, but
the growth in the ﬁeld in recent
years has come from smaller
high—tech ﬁrms and research-
oriented universities, including
Carnegie’ Mellon and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
ranks above the national- average
in spin—off companies and both
Pitt and Duquesne sponsor Small
Business Development Centers
providing expertise to ensure
the success of small businesses
in the region. Pitt, CMU and
UPMC employ approximately
4 percent of the local work force
and create another 19,000 jobs
from the businesses that rely on
the spending of those associated
with the non-proﬁts in Oakland.
VVhile the corporate presence in
Pittsburgh haspdeclined (drop-
ping from a national ranking of
3rd for corporate headquarters to
8th), the success and notoriety of
the educational institutions has
increased, resulting in economic
strength that the region would
not otherwise have experienced.
The direct and residual impact

of these institutions cannot be"

calculated. In essence, Pitts-
burgh would not have much of
an economy without them. In
light of the economic history
of the region where taxes, along
with other factors, have driven
business from Pittsburgh to

surrounding counties as well

as out of state, we question the

direction of the economic plan

that you are proposing for Pitts-

burgh. There was a time when
it was unthinkable that the steel

industry would falter or would
leave this area. VV"1ll the envi-
ronment of Pittsburgh be again

a place that economic forces such

as these universities leave or are

encouraged to stay and become

more successful?

The University of Pittsburgh
does voluntarily pay $85,000 per
annum for municipal services and
because of it presence, also gen-
erates other monies for the City
in the‘ form of amusement taxes,
wage taxes, parking taxes and real
estate taxes. Yet the University
of Pittsburgh Police patrol the

Oakland area and have an arrest —

record of 80 percent involving
city and not University mat-
ters. This section of the city
has a high pedestrianpresence,
yet many city roads have either
faded or no crosswalks, let alone
signage or cross lights. Addition-
ally, Pitt provides services to the
city such as clinical health services
to schools and communities, a
volunteer labor pool of 40,000
community service hours, and
the Community Outreach Part-
nership Center that uses Uni-
versity resources for economic
development, job training and
neighborhood revitalization.
Should the University charge
for these and other services to
the community as you are sug-
gesting that we be charged for
city services? To your argument
that the $10 city occupation tax
has not changed since 1965, we
would ask, “VVhy? ” What kind of
financial management practices
do not review or adjust sources
of funding in 38 years? These are

not the kind of practices that are
taught nor used at the University
of Pittsburgh.

The educational institutions
along with the service-oriented

non—proﬁts face budget problems .

because of the poor economy. Pitt
is currently facing continuing
funding cutbacks from the com—
monwealth resulting, in part, in
staff cutbacks. The taxation of
non—proﬁt educational institu-
tions will surely increase their
budget burdens resulting in
additional staff reductions. VV1ll
Pittsburgh again be one of the
leaders in unemployment in the
nation because of the economic
environment? We askyou, Mayor
Murphy, to rethink your plan
for an economic environment
that penalizes institutions that
bring economic strength and
stability to the region and adopt
a plan for an environment that

attracts and encourages organi-

zations with these traits. Other
cities are developing plans to
make their regions attractive to
potential economic drivers and
would relish the opportunity to
have these institutions of higher
education in their communities.
We request that you not tax the
non—profIt organizations that

provide services for the com— ‘

munity and fuel the economic

‘engine for the region. Doing

so might cause irreparable

damage to our community and -

its economy. Pittsburgh and the
surrounding region have already
paid the economic price due. in
part to the poor managementand
lack of planning on the part of our
leaders in public administration.
We ask that you not make us pay
that price again.

Nancy O’Brien—Bleil, man-
ager of advanced training and

died suddenly May 31, 2003,

. of an apparent heart attack. She

was 61.
“What people are com—

menting most about was how »

optimistic and positive Nancy
always was,” said her supervisor,
Margaret A. Duronio, associate
vice chancellor for advancement
services. '

Duronio also praised O’Brien-

, Bleil’s patience in training staff to

use Institutional Advancement’s
three—year—old information
system. “Nancy never gave up
on people,’-’ Duronio said. “She
never got tired of helping them

and making sure they understood .

the system,” .

O’Brien—Bleil earned under-
graduate and_ graduate degrees in
communication studies at Pitt,
and had extensive training in
computer software programs and
word processing. Before .begin—
ning work at Pitt in September
2000, she was a software trainer
locally for Sarcom, Inc.

Among Bleil_’s survivors is
her husband, Jim O’Brien-Bleil,
whom she married inJune 1999 in
Heinz Memorial Chapel. “Even
though Nancy had grandchil-
dren, she and Jim thought of
themselves as newlyweds and

acted that way,” said Duronio. —

“Jim would send ﬂowers to her

office.”

Nancy, in return, would
indulge her husband’s model
railroading hobby with surprise
gifts of equipment he was “too
cheap.” to buy for himself, Jim
O’Brien—Bleil recalled with a
laugh.

“Nancy was divorced about
20 years ago,” he said, “and she
used to say that before she and I
met, she hadn’t found anybody
she could call her soul—mate. I’d
had a bad divorce myself about
1 0 years ago. We were introduced
by a common friend, and we just
clicked. ‘

“We both believed that you
should treatthe person you’re
married to better than anyone
else in the world. So manypeople,
they have a hard time at work with
the boss and they come home and

_ yell, at their spouse. Nancy and I

tried never to do that. We got a
late start with each other, but we
packed a lot intoathe ﬁve years we
were together.” ‘

June 4, 2003, following a brief
illness. She was 53.
Hoffmannhadbeenemployed
at Pitt since 1996, when she
was appointed administrative
assistant to the then—chair of
the Department of Library
and Information Science, Edie
Rasmussen.
_ “Carol was very much the face
of the school,” Rasmussen said.

“She was a wonderful recruiter

because she would have great
conversations with potential
students, and she really got to
know who they are, what their
interests were, and whether this
was the right school for them.”
According _ to Margaret
Kimmel, professor in the library
and information science depart-
ment, “As an administrative
assistant, a chair could not ask
for a more efficient person. But
beyond that, Carol had an inter-
est in and ability to deal with our
students, and had a real impact
on them, as well as the ability
to deal with sometimes cranky.
faculty,” Kimmel said. “She was
calm, patient and always carried
through on details. But she was
also a team player.” -
In 1998, Hoffmann wa
hired as administrative assistant
to the director of the University
Library System (U LS); last year
she became associate curator at
the Curtis Theatre Collection,
one of the special collections‘
libraries in ULS. p

Aston credited‘ Hoffmann
with organizing Pittsburgh the-
atre memorabilia at the Curtis
collection, which includes more
than a half—million theatre pro-
grams and 25,000 photographs.

“Her death is very tragic for
the library system and the School
of Information Sciences,” said
Rush Miller, ULS director and

University Librarian. “Carol got ’
her M.L.S.?degree in December

1995 . In fact, I had her as a student
my ﬁrst year here. She was one of
those rare people who was totally

giving to others. We’re all going ~

to miss her.”

Kimmel said Hoffmann ’,

expressed a twinge of re gretwhen
she left the School of Information
Sciences because she missed the
daily contact with SIS students.
“But she continued to work with
our internshere, right up to this
last semester,” Kimmel said. 1
Hoffmann earned a B.A. in

GSPH’s dean discusses
NIH funding, the
ﬁeld of public health,

and how his school

 ischanging.  

Statistics from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
, reveal that in the last two years Pitt’s Graduate School ofPuhlic
Health (GSPH) hasmore than tripled its rate of increase (40. 9
percent) in NIH funding over the other top_ public health schools.
ForF Y2 002, NIH research grant ﬁcndin g totaled $44 million,
as compared to $38.32 million in FY2001 and $31.2 million
in FY2000. The "total NIH funding, which includes research
grants, training awards, fellowships and Rd7‘D contracts for
GSPH, is $47 million. . , 0
Under the leadership of Dean Bernard Goldstein, who took
over the reins of the school two year ago, GSPH has risen to
I 4th nationally among the 31 accredited US. public health
schools in NIH funding. '

Goldstein discussed GSPH’sstatus, success and goals recently
_............~......._2zg,z't./:..I.J72iuez¢~siz34—.i3?§T . .: .. . . A  «

 

UNIVERSITY TIMES: The school’s NIH funding
has been rising dramatically since you became dean.
Why? And what does it mean for your school?
GOLDSTEIN: NIH funding is considered a superb
metric of the competitiveness of your faculty for basic
biomedical research. VVhile we’re very proud of this, we
recognize that it is not the only metric of our success.

_ Perhaps I would even downplay it a little bit: It is
a much better metric for a medical school than for a
school of public health. About half the external funding
for public health schools comes from the NIH, while it’s
closer to‘ 80 percent for medical schools. a

We’re particularly interested in other metrics and we
think we’ve done very well in those as well. For instance,
we have two major competitive CDC [Centers for Dis-

, ease Control] grants in the pasttwo years, one funding a
Center for HealthyAging, the other the Center for Public
Health Preparedness. They’re in the range of $700,000

to $1 million a year, so they’re, substantial grants but , A

neither gets into the NIH statistics.

Also, we have people who are doing superb work on
health care organization, health care administration,
community health, public health policy and management
—— these and othersare competitively funded from other
governmental organizations and from foundations. '

So as dean, I need to strike a balance between touting
our NIH total and our other important work. _

The good news is that the NIH is becoming in some
ways a-better metric "for us than it was before, because
the NIH is widening its horizons. I’m going to get on

_ my soap-box here. I’ve said this in the past: The National
Institutes of Health sometimes acts like a national insti-
tutes of disease. The NIH has traditionally been focused

‘on biomedical research aimed at the understanding of
disease leading to cures. .

" The classic deﬁnition of health by the World Health
Organization and -the 'U.S. government is that health is
not merely the absence of disease, but includes the social,
physical and mental well—being of the individual. And
the NIH is broadening its mandate by focusing more
on community-based approaches to health.

Can you give an example? , _
For instance, one of our most recent grants is a $6.2

million NIH grant called “Export Health” for the Center’

for Minority Health, which uses a community-based
approach to dealing with health disparities. .

V A public health approach says that the best we can
do really is deﬁned by the healthiest segment of our

population, which tends to be relatively afﬂuent, white
individuals. So, based on the resources that are available
now, and based upon human biology, we’re saying that
any group that isn’t doing as well on the average‘ basically
could do as well. '

One thing we’re learned from the human genome
project is that genetic difference is trivial. Now, for those
people who have a genetically determined disease, obvi-
ously it’s overwhelming; but on the whole, there is very
littleidifference between different races, different groups,
so that what we’re talking about are disparities that are
determined by something other than ‘biology, such as
access to medical care.

But to the extent we need to change our understand-

_ , ing, mu‘ s9eial-:~syste1=ns;»eu=zelife~s«t:yleswand-. those A-lcijnds~of~«« Iv
patient care and research, so that were we to move this

things — that’s where the National Institutes of Health
in the past played very little role but is now increasing
their role. .

If we can a make a difference in these disparities

using a population approach — Wow, the number of

lives saved and the years of healthy living added to lives
would be enormous! A

IVVhy is NIH changing its approach?

I think there’s a lot of public pressure and public frus-
tration. People are saying, ‘Gee, we’Ve invested all this
money in NIH research, what difference is it making in

"our lives?’ The jargon phrase these days is ‘translational

research,’ which, frankly, is translated in different ways
by different people, but the bottom line is how we take
-what we ﬁnd at the bench and bring it to make a differ-
ence to people, and to do that you need epidemiology

,_and you need biostatistics, which, not incidentally, are

two of the departments here. .

A key strength of the school is the Epidemiology Data
Center. We have evolved through the years because of out-
standing key faculty. [GSPH epidemiologists] Lew Kuller
and Katherine Detre would be on ‘top of that list.

A central aspect to epidemiology is what’s called
power: Do you have the power to ask the questions?
Do you have enough patients, enough individuals in
the population, so that what you get has some statistical
likelihood or meaning? '

So does Pittsburgh’s dwindling population put the
school at a disadvantage?

VVhat we’ve pioneered here —. some of it by Bernie
Fisher in the N SABP [National Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel Project] —— are major studies where Pittsburgh
has been the home for beginning the studies. Ifyou have 10

people with Hepatitis C in a hundred different locations, ‘

you have 1,000 people, enough to make a meaningful
study even wheniwe simply could not reach that critical
mass of people here locally. --

But you need to be sure that the data are handled
very carefully, that protocols are being strictly followed.
Katherine Detre is a master at this. Pittsburgh is the
data-"management center for many major NIH grants.
Being able to do that is something that puts us well in
the lead of other schools. I

We have other advantages here: for instance, the
stability of our population. We’re the second oldest

population in the country, second to Dade County_.

(Fla.). The difference is that most of our people retire
here, while a large number of Dade County residents

If you want to do a 30-year study you really can’t do
that in -Dade County, because people aren’t there for 30
years and you can’t do it elsewhere because by the time
you’re ready to measure outcomes, the population has
moved to Dade County.

Are there other advantages GSPH enjoys?

We have a wonderful symbiotic relationship with
the medical school. Really, it’s perfect. Because our epi-
demiology and biostatistics are so strong here, we can
participate with the clinicians and the laboratory people
there in putting together some top—notch grants that get

well-funded by the NIH. We couldn’t do that without
‘all-~th e~g“reat-»things*they’~readarn-gth ere VVI th ‘patien rs‘ and

school away from the medical school we’d be in great
trouble, and the medicalschool would lose some of the
leadership it enjoysin NIH funding were it not for the
factthat this school of public health is right here.

(See page 4 sidehar on -NIHﬁm.dingﬁ2r Health Sciences
schools at Pitt.)

There is roughly about one school ofpublic health for
every four medical schools in this country, but ifyou look
at the top 20 NIH-funded medical schools, about one-half
have public health schools on the same campus.

Actually, our public health school ranks higher in NIH
research funding than three of the six Pennsylvania medical
schools — last year we jumped ahead of Penn State.

Another advantage here: Except for arts and sciences,
I’ve got the broadest range ofdisciplines. l’ve got labora-
tory people; epidemiologists; social science experts; health
education practitioners; economists; data specialists.

Our belief is that‘ there are no major public health
problems that you can’t solve better with interdisciplin-
ary work. And while there’s no reason that the French
department andvchemistry department need to be next
to each other, for us, there are no departments we have

that do not beneﬁt from having the other departments —

close by. So a lot of my challenge as dean is to get differ-

.ent folks together from different disciplines, and focus

on problems. ,

And what we’re seeing the NIH doing is moving its
funding strategies to much more openness to research
that has a broad range of disciplines involved.

Is it an issue that GSPH mainly is housed in one of
the older campus buildings?

Yes, it’s one of the older buildings and we’re proud
of ‘how we’ve been able to do as muchas we have in one
of the older buildings. Also, we’re fortunate that we can
lease a lot of good space in Oakland to support our fac-
ulty. We would love a new building, but we recognize
the University is committed to the 10-year [facilities]
plan [which does not include a new building for GSPH].
VVhen discussion for the next plan comes around, we’ll be
in there pitching. We might get some space in the BST3
[Biomedical Science Tower 3] but the medical school
issues are still the key ones, because by comparison we’re
still relatively small potatoes. .

Are there other items on your wish list for the

school? . I -

lation genetics. In fact, .we’re the
only public health school that has
a full department; at most univer-
sities, if there is a department of
human genetics, it’s in the medical
school. We would like to expand
our programs there.

Genetics for most of us loads‘

the gun and the environment
pulls the trigger, which is a very

good way of looking at this. Our ‘

genetic potentials are going to be
manifested depending upon our
environment interaction, and by
environment I mean in the broad-
est sense: what we eat, our sexual
habits,’ as well as the pollutants
that are out there.

To work that interaction out,
the ideal place is where there
are particularly isolated human
populations, very little intermar-
riage, in rather distinctly different
environments. The United States
is the worst place in the world
for that.

Add to that the fact that some
of the more powerful approaches
to genetics involve working with

siblings, and in large families that

works best—— we don’t have many
large families either.

We’re aiming our genetics
approach at trying to understand
why people are susceptible to dis-
ease and what are the characteris-
tics that we could all change that
would affect that susceptibility,
so it’s a preventive, population-
based public health approach.

Again, the bulk of the NIH
research in genetics up to this
point has been to cure geneti-
cally determined diseases, but
that’s changing.

And the other way we’re

interested in expanding is in‘

global health.

We’ve always had a signiﬁcant
amount of global health pro-
grams, but we would like topgive
consideration to whether it will
be a department, maybe in 3-5
years. A lot of our students are
from overseas; part of it is they

get the training for when they
return to their countries. Part of it
is that American students need to
learn about international public
health issues, for,_instance,, the
population" basis ‘of genetics, the
ability to study the ideas behind
gene/ environment interaction.
We’re not in a world where

we can sa ‘We’re from America
Y: 7 .

now let us study you.’ We have to
do this by working cooperatively,
and so We’re proud of the dif-
ferent codperative international
programs we have developed,

V including several of them that

are competitively funded by the
NIH.

What do you see as the local
role of GSPH?

Public health itself is very
much a local issue. One of our
departments is infectious diseases
and microbiology. It’s the oldest

kind of public health; that’s where _

public health schools came from.
Now with SARS, bioterrorism,
HIV/AID S, We’re into that again:
We’ve got to get people working
on this, and in fact we do, we’ve
had many meetings on these
issues. The issue of SARS, on
the one hand, and bioterrorism
demonstrate further that there
is a need for public health infra-
structure in this country.

One of the stories about the
response to bioterrorism that isn’t
really as recognized as much as it
should be, is what did the public
health workforce not get done?
Because you just can’t be passive.
We have a very thin workforce.

In fact, Pennsylvania ranks last‘

in the country in public health

» workforce per capita.

We have the Center for Public
Health Practice that deals with
public health practitioners,
funded by federal agencies to
help train folks here in Penn-
sylvania.

And we have a good working
relationship with the Allegheny

County Health Department,
something that’s been very
important to me, and we’re
working with the state health
department as well. Part of our
job is to make sure that We’re
training future leaders of health
departments, and the best way to
do that is to have a good asso-
ciation with the departments to
begin with. . A

I We also have the support
of Mayor [Tom] Murphy. and

County Executive [Iim] Roddey. .

They and othersturn to us with

these issues and ask .. ,to. hel _'
with the interface. Bfit ”by"ith’e

same token, we recognize we’re
offering advice based on the best
scientiﬁc evidence available, and
we’re constantly looking for that,
but We’re not the health depart-
ment.

‘ To use SARS as an example,

what you do is ask not zfbut when. '

We need to-assume that SARS
will get to Pittsburgh, to askwhat
will we do, and there are so many
uncertainties. .

I believe we will be very well
prepared. Our infectious disease
folks who run laboratories also
help run a medical school clini-
cal lab, which has the assays to
test whether or not someone has
SARS; and they’re working on

ﬁnding out which assays work
best. .

I’m happy to see the mayor
and county executive support our
efforts on this; they’ve asked the
school of public health to be part

of the cit}/s committee concerned —

with public health issues.

What about more preventive
public health issues?

I’d like to see more emphasis

on a «planned environment. For
instance, whether you and I
walk, how much weight we put

,. ; d  . .-—,~b_..'-?i.$¥.~..iS to.
some eir"f:“ei'1”t”éI‘i‘i“é"f6‘tli’€’Eondition
of the sidewalks.

So from an environmental
health point of view, in the
development of the suburbs, the
roads, where we put houses and
fences, has long-range effects.
We’re designing neighborhoods

where kids can’t walk 100 yards to ‘

see a friend because theres no way
to get there. Once you get into
suburbia, you have to drive the kid
everywhere, and you wonder why
we have childhood obesity.

The NIH is now thinking ‘

about these issues. I just came
from an NIH planningmeetingin
North Carolina, a retreat focused
on how to get the NIH involved
in issues like diabetes -— not just

how to detect and treat it — but
what are better ways to prevent
it, how is it related to obesity, and
child obesity.

The question we were asking
is, is that an NIH issue? The ques-
tion is not if it’s a public health
issue. It’s clearly a public health
issue. But to solve it, we’ve got
to get the policy people and the
environmental health people
together; we’ve got to get the
planning people on board, too.

‘And We’re not that good yet

at getting. the planning people

....involved.,.  .b11t.....,.;.«\..r.,€=..’..¥..-«,...<?, _ _g,e,,,t,,r,,_;:n g

better.

My job as clean is to serve on
these NIH and other national
committees and convince the

NIH in general we want to go

there.
A The more they’re convinced,
the better off we are here."

We really think we contribute
something to the city, and it’s not
just the fact that we bring in a
substantial amount of federal
funding that translates into jobs
and taxes and so forth, but also
gives recognition to Pittsburgh
as a leader.

Again, We’re proud of the fact
that We’re high in NIH funding,

but there’s a whole lotmore going

on here. - A I

Mayor defends tax proposals at Faculty Assembly

CONTINUED FROM PAGE I

funding cuts have forced the
University to impose double-
digit tuition hikes while limiting
salary raises for most employees
to not much above inﬂation.

After hearing Murphy com-
plain that 45 percent of Pitts-
burgh businesses pay no business
taxes, theatre arts chairperson
Attilio Favorini recommended
that the city focus on convinc-
ing the state to eliminate outdated
regulations that exempt utilities,
banks and ﬁnancial institutions
from such taxes. _

One problem with. that,
Murphy replied, is that the city
could tax PNC Bank, Alcoa and
other, currently exempt compa-
nies only on their Pittsburgh-

based revenues, not their national
or international business.

“My point is,” Favorini con-
tinued, “let’s not lose sight of the
meaningful difference between
for—profit and not-for—profit
enterprises. There seems to be
enough in the deep pockets of
the for-proﬁts that if we had a
rationalized way "of going after
them, then the not—for—proﬁts
could go about continuing to
contribute in their substantial
ways to the reputation and health
of the city.” ’

“That doesn’t pay a police
ofﬁcer or a paramedic,” Murphy

. rejoined. “The contributions

you’ve mentioned are noted and
appreciated and important, but at

.

the end of the day they don’t pay
the salaries of essential personnel
in the city.”

Rich Colwell, newly elected
president of Pitt’s Staff Associa-
tion Council (SAC), pointed out
that the city gets nearly $10 1nil—
lion annually, thanks to Pitt, in
amusement taxes, parking taxes,
occupation taxes, citywage taxes,
and [property taxes charged on
Sennott Square and some other
Pitt real estate.

(See SAC ’s letter to the editor on
page 2 for details on Pitt ﬁnancial
contributions to the city.)

“I would be the first to admit
that universities represent an
important part of the city’s
economy,” Murphy said. But the

Taxing Pitt and other non-profit employers might have a "reverse multiplier effect/', ultimately
hurting the city's economy as institutions and their employees have fewer dollars to spend
locally, suggested biological sciences professor Lewis A. Jacobson, at far left.

mayor noted that Pitt itself does
not pay the taxes that Colwell
mentioned, except for $800,000
in property taxes.

“When people attend a
basketball game at the Petersen
Center, the University doesn’t pay
any amusement taxes. It merely
acts as an agent for us to collect
those taxes,” Murphy said.

When Colwell began citing
the contributions of'Pittcampus
police in patroling Oakland, the
mayor bristled. “Are you suggest-
ing that the City of Pittsburgh
does not have a very highlyvisible,
very expensive police presence?”
Murphy asked Colwell.

“If you’re telling me that the
University of Pittsburgh now
wants to police Oakland, I’m
‘delighted to let. you have it,”
Murphy said with a grin, eliciting
laughter from the audience.

“_Is that what you’re saying to
me? ” Murphy pursued. “Because
’I’m going to tell you, if I go down
across the street from the O [the
Original Hot Dog shop at Forbes
Avenue and Bouquet Street], Iwill
see half of the city police from this
zone sitting down there onmost
Friday evenings when classes are

‘in session.”

Colwell noted that 80 per-
cent of the people arrested by
Pitt police are not University
students or employees.

Murphy countered: “Do you
want to talk about the costs of
Pittsburgh Police investigations

“We don’t want to go down
that road,” the mayor added,
coolly. “I don’t think you do, and
I don’t think it’s productive.”

Pitt administrators who 5
attended , the Faculty Assembly
meeting likewise tried not to
sound antagonistic.

“We have to ﬁnd a way to
resolve this [city ﬁnancial crisis]
without it becoming confron-
tational,” said Vice Chancellor
Clark. But Pitt ofﬁcials View the
University’s‘ tax—exempt status as
being “sacred,” Clark said.

“We feel that if we allow a
payroll preparation tax, then
a couple of years from now
— maybe it won’t be the city,
but maybe the county or some
other entity would try to apply
another tax,” said Clark. (Murphy
disagreed, arguing that the city’s
proposed payroll tax would not
threaten the tax—exempt standing
of Pittsburgh non-proﬁt institu-
tions.) »
Pitt’s $1.3 ‘billion annual
operating budget is based on the
University’s tax—exempt status,
Clark said. “If we incurred an
additional, signiﬁcant cost — if
we had to pay our full property
tax bill,for example — then obvi-
ouslywe’d have to come up with a
whole new funding structure.”

Murphy replied: “We believe i
the payroll preparation tax is a
fair, relatively simple way for an
employer” to measure a tax. But,
at the end of the day, there are
2 5 ways to solve this problem” of
insufﬁcient city revenues.

After Murphy left the meet-

_ ing, Pitt Vice Provost for Aca-

demic Planning and Resources
Management Robert F. Pack -
told Faculty Assembly members
that Pittsburgh city schools and
government ‘buildings together

represent the largest component
of tax—exempt properties in the
city — a fact that Murphy didn’t
mention.

“So, this isn’t a case where
certain non-proﬁts like Pitt and
UPMC have somehow been
voraciously gobbling up the city
of Pittsburgh and taking property
off the tax rolls,” said Pack. “Pitt
has not expanded signiﬁcantly at
all in taking property off the tax
rolls.” 1

Pack said it is “pretty easy
to resent” suggestions that Pitt
is not pulling its weight in the
city’s economy.

“The future of the city doesn’t
rest in getting $32 million from
the University of Pittsburgh each
year through a payroll prepara-
tion tax,” the vice provost said.
“It exists in attracting jobs and
industry and creating compa-
nies, in doing exactly the kinds
ofthings the University of Pitts-
burgh is trying so hard to do. And
to do that, we desperately need
partners in the city.”

Pitt’s long-term partnership
with the city “is much more
important, and ultimately much
more beneﬁcial, than this short-
term issue ofthe payroll prepara-
tion tax,” Pack said.

East meets Westin

Bradford professor’s art

Oh, East is East, and West is West and never the twain shall meet 

*f_,jihe dichotomy of East-

: em and Western views

 on ethics and life seems

forever a gulf unbridged. But for

Pitt-Bradford assistant professor

Kong Ho, the two divergent cul-

tures merge in his life, and, hence,
in his artwork.

“For years, like many other
artists of my generation, I have
been content. to refer to myself
as a bi-cultural artist,” says the
Hong Kong native who earned
a B.A. in 1985 from the Chinese
University of Hong Kong and a
graduate degree in ﬁne arts at
Texas Tech University in 1994.
“But I ﬁnd that this label of who
I am as an artist and person is
meaningless.”

Rather than seeing art as
creating a universal dialogue,
something he says is an artiﬁcial
construction, Ho prefers to see
his work as a conglomeration
of his experiences moving back
and forth between two differ-

ent worlds, while integrating-

the conﬂicts between Eastern
and Western cultural inﬂuences

as. an expression of his own

uniqueness.

“Life is full of contradictions
and so is art,” says the award-
winning art professor whose
work is on exhibit until June 20
at CP Artspace in Washington,
D.C., where he also lectured last
week. I

Ho’s artwork has been exhib-
ited in more than 70 international
and regional venues, including
the United Nations General
Assembly Building in New York,
the Clymer Museum and Gallery
in Washington, D.C., the Fine
Arts Museum in New Mexico, the
Osaka Prefecture University in
Japan and the Peking Museum
ofArt in China.

Prior to coming to Pitt-Brad-
ford in 2001, Ho was an instructor
or adjunct faculty member at sev-
eral universities in Hong Kong as
well as an adjunct faculty member
at Western Texas College, where
he taught printmaking. Ho has
taught courses in color theory,
photography, watercolor paint-
ing, illustration, ﬁgure drawing,
ﬁne arts and design concepts,
among other art disciplines.

“Just as with everything else in
life, the images in my art appear
to have ﬂuid meanings —— even to
take on different physical char-
acteristics when one looks care-
fully at the structure of the work
and contemplates the image as a

gwhole.' In other words, ‘Things

are not what they appear to be,”’
he says. “Art is mainly about what
you can see. But part of it is about
something you cannot see.”

Ho has been traveling regu-
larly between the United States
and Hong Kong over the past
10 years, and the everyday-life
cultural differences inform his
artwork, he says.

“Philosophically, I allow my

 

——Rudyara' Kz'p'lz'7zg, “The Ballad of East and I/Vest”

work to follow the ideology of
Taoism. And I have the creative
inﬂuences of folk religion in
Hong Kong, with its images and
sounds and -smells of the rituals
performed at Taoist temples and
the pageantry of Chinese holidays
and ethnic customs. Many of my
personal symbols have evolved
from objects I associate with my
cultural heritage.” _
‘On the other hand, the cul-

tural freedom, individualistic‘

ideals and sheer vastness of space
in the West, along with his 1993
marriage to American ceramic
artist Martie Geiger-Ho, have
inﬂuenced him aswell, he says.
“Art in a Suitcase,” a non-
chronological video he made of
his life experiences, shows how
everyday encounters in a foreign
environment have served as a

catalyst for his artistic pursuits, ‘

Ho says.‘The video was part of
a mixed-media‘ exhibition this.
spring at Laredo Community
College in Texas.

According to Ho, the suitcase
itself represents his life experi-

. ence, the clothes. inside .....are ..

his creative ideals and cultural
beliefs, and the daily necessities

he carries symbolize his thoughts »

and feelings. Travel tickets are
his creative concepts; maps,
his artistic dreams and pursuits,
and books his artistic expression,
experience and knowledge, he
says of the video account.

“My new video work is not
about creating a narrative story,
or even a comparison between
two places and cultures,” he says.
“Instead, my work is about the
possible relationships between
images that I have either actually
experienced, or I have found and
appropriated in my artwork.

“Seeing yourself in a mirror is
not understanding yourself. You
have to look within. In my life
I see order‘ and disorder. Like
nature, which shows us great
order, nature also shows us a
tornado. For me these are always
coming together, Yin and Yang,
they are in harmony.”

Ho strives to create tension
and drama in his art by integrating
order and chaos, using a multi-
layering of representational

imagery drawn from emotions, .

memories and dreams.

. “Many of my paintings may
start with order: the order of
science, geometrical form, the
circle, the spiral, or, since I have
lived in cities, high—rise buildings,
arranged on my canvas,” he says.
“Then I destroy the order, with
color, or splashes and brush
strokes that cut through part of
it, or I havesomething coming
out of the ground. Some people
may think the droppings, the

‘splashes, the disorder means

the paintings are damaged. But
by adding layers and layers of
color, and symbolic images that
have personal signiﬁcance to

me from my cultural heritage,
I am moving between different
worlds, and sometimes you see
one, sometimes the other. It’s
a rendering sometimes I can’t
control. - '

“To know me, art is my state-
ment,” Ho says. “But, it is not
linear. I am not trying to engage

the viewer into agreeing with a .

particular viewpoint. What I am
offeringthe viewer—and myself
— are bits and pieces of visual

_ information that he or she may

interpret and experience in the
manner that is most stimulating
and enjoyable for them.”

For Ho, who has been par-'
’ tially paralyzed by polio since the

age of 1, art plays another role.

“I look to see how I ﬁt.
Compared to other people I
have limitations, my body has
limitations. But there is nothing
I can do about that.

“My art has been an excel-
lent way to express myself, the
bright colors, symbols, images,
dreams that allow me freedom

fromarnyv lirnitations,  4

me to break through restraints
of time and space. Many of my
images aresymbolic of the desire
for freedom.”

Ho also is a proponent of
public art. Before immigrating to
the United States in 2000, he was
on the faculty of the University of
Hong Kong, where he founded
the Hong Kong Mural Society, a
non-proﬁt art organization. He
has completed murals at public
housing developments and in
several public high‘ schools in
Hong Kong.

In 2001, Ho joined the fac-

iulty of Pitt—Bradford, where

he teaches courses in drawing,
painting, and design; his Mural
Design course is the ﬁrst commu-

‘ nity—based public art and general

education course offered at the
Bradford campus.

“The mural is a form of public
art that encourages a sense of
community. This is very differ-
ent from teaching painting or
design,” Ho says. The collab-
orative mural completed by. last
year’s Mural Design class now
hangs in Pitt—Bradford’s‘ Fisher
Hall, he says. '

Ho will apply for U. S . citizen-
ship this fall, although he con-
siders himself an international
citizen. Hesays Bradford is a
change from his big-city past,
but “living” close to nature will
deﬁnitely affect my future art
direction.

“I believe art is for all of us.
VVhether you have a talent for
art or not, you can still appreci-
ate it, and that appreciation can
help you realize your creativity
and talent in other areas, what-
ever you do in life.”

Or whatever culture you’re‘

Melanoma vaccine
shows promising results
Results from the largest

,multi—site study to date evaluat-

inga peptide—derived therapeutic '
vaccine for melanoma have dem-
onstrated a correlation between
tumor growth (progression free
survival) and immune response
for patients with advanced disease
who received the vaccination.

_ The ﬁndings provide promis-
ing evidence that researchers can
activate a patient’s own immune
system to ﬁght advanced mela-
noma, according to investigators
from the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG).

“This is the ﬁrst time we
have evaluated peptide-derived
melanoma vaccine results from
a multi—center cooperative group

, trial,”‘said]ohnKirkwood,prin-

cipal investigator of the study,
professor of medicine at Pitt and
director of UPCI’s Melanoma
Center. “VVhile these results are
preliminary, we have found evi-
dence that the vaccine stimulates
an immune response.”

The phase II study evaluated

a multiepitope CD8 T—cell vac-

cine comprised of three peptides
derived from tumor—associated
antigens of melanoma. The
vaccine was evaluatedalone, in
combination with granulocyte

  masr.9nh.a.g.eg.= 
factor (GM-

tion with interferon and in com-

SF), In ‘combina- ‘

bination with both GM-CSF and
interferon. .
.Malignant melanoma is one of
the deadliest forms of skin cancer.
An estimated 54,2 00 new cases of
melanoma are expected in 2003
and 7,600 deaths are expected
to occur.
The study includes more than

30 institutions and is funded by

the National Institutes of Health
and the Schering Plough and
Immunex Corporations.

Combination therapy
beneﬁts older patients
with advanced lung cancer

According to researchers at
the University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute (UPCI), lung
cancer patients aged 70 and older
can beneﬁt from a combination
treatmentforadvancednon—small
cell lung cancer (N SCLC) when
compared to younger patients.

The results indicate that
older patients with NSCLC
responded to and tolerated the
combination therapy similar to
younger patients.

(The study, presented by
Chandra P. Belani, lead inves-
tigator and a Pitt professor of
medicine, demonstrated that
weekly paclitaxel in combination
with full doses of carboplatin offer
a safe and effective treatment
option for elderly patients with
advanced NSCLC.

“Aggressive chemotherapy
regimens are often avoided in
older ‘patients with advanced
lung cancer due to concerns about
toxic effects associated with the
treatment,” said Belani, who also
co—directs the Lung Cancer Pro-
gram at UPCI. “Old age should

_ not be a deterrent to prescribing

eh‘-in*i**Eh"ef** l- P

the most appropriate and effec-
tive treatment for advanced lung
cancer as demonstrated clearly in
this study.”

A difﬁcult cancer to treat due
to its advanced stage at diagnosis,
lung cancer will be newly diag-
nosed in over 170,000 people in
the United States in 2003. Inci-
dence of lung cancer increases
as people age and is highest in
individuals over the age of 70.

Co~investigator of the study
was Sakkaraiappan Ramalin-
gam of Pitt. Support was pro-
vided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

New strategy improves
lung cancer survival

Other results presented
by Pitt professor Chandra P.
Belani, co-director of UPCI’s
Lung Cancer Program, dem-
onstrate that a new therapeutic
radiation strategy for non-small
cell lung cancer (N SCLC) — the
most common form of the disease
— leads to improved survival for
lung-cancer patients with locally
advanced disease.

In the study, hyperfraction—
ated accelerated radiotherapy
(HART) was compared to stan-
dard thoracic radiotherapy fol-
lowing chemotherapy. HART

is a strategy in which radiation.

is administered frequently over
a shorter period of time for two
and a half weeks compared to

Body cooling promotes .
survival, brain recovery
aﬁer cardiac arrest

Cooling body temperature
to levels consistent with hypo-

thermia improves survival when .

induced after cardiac arrest and
also promotes growth factors
important for the brain’s recov-
ery, suggests a study performed
by researchers in the Department
of Emergency Medicine at Pitt’s
School of Medicine.

Although the study involved .

animals, the ﬁndings already
have had an inﬂuence_ on the
management of" cardiac arrest

patients being treated at UPMC, 0

where the lead researcher is also

a practicing emergency medicine .
‘ physician.

Cardiac arrest is the sudden,
abrupt loss of heart function.
Death usually occurs within
minutes unless cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation (CPR) and
rapid deﬁbrillation is available.
As cardiac arrest progresses,
blood How to the brain ceases.
If a patient survives long enough
to make it to the hospital, the
patient often will be in a coma
and at risk of permanent brain
injury. In fact, less than 10 percent
of patients make it through the
chain-of-survival (early access to
care, early CPR, early deﬁbrilla-

s

iardgrilead”

tion andiearlyadvanceidcare)i 

researchers sought to ﬁnd out if
hypothermia treatment played a
rolein survival from cardiac arrest
and brain recovery.

The researchers found that
when the animals were cooled to
33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees
Fahrenheit) beginning one hour
after cardiac arrest, there was
100 percent survival, whereas
only 75 percent of the animals
left at normal temperature of
37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F)
survived. Furthermore, micro-
scopic brain injury was reduced
by half, and some animals showed
functional improvement in as
little as 12 hours after cardiac
arrest. V Conversely, the animals
left at normal temperature after
cardiac arrest showed little or no
functional improvement.

Previous studies from the
researchers detected increased
levels of growth factors derived

’ from brain cells when hypo-

thermia was induced after
cardiac arrest. In the current
study, researchers also found
that levels of growth factors
derived from glia—cells in the
brain that support nerve cells
are increased by hypothermia as
well. These growth factors may
play an important role in brain
recovery after cardiac arrest.
“Although it is known from
clinical studies that cooling the
brain offers therapeutic beneﬁts
to patients, further studies need
to be done to_ determine how
much the brain should be cooled
and for how long,” said Clifton

" Caﬂavvay, a”Pittassistant profes— s

sor of emergency medicine. “By
understanding the molecular
mechanisms of brain recovery in
cardiac arrest, we can prescribe a
more effective treatment.”
Based on this and other stud-

ies, Callaway and colleagues are
already beginning the routine
cooling of cardiac arrest patients
brought to the emergency depart-
ment at UPMC Presbyterian.

Co—investigators of this study
include Katherine M. Schmidt,
Brian]. D’Cruz and Donald B.
DeFranco, all of Pitt’s medical

New guidelines could save
health care industry billions
New decision guidelines for
identifying patients with low-
risk heart failure may prevent
unnecessary hospitalizations
and could signiﬁcantly reduce
health care—related expenses,
which according to the National
Heart Lung and Blood Institute,
cost the indusuy an estimated $2 1
billion per year.
These guidelines come from

1 a Pitt study.

Heart failure is the primary
reason for hospital admissions of
1 million patients each year in
the United States. Most of these
patients are 65 years of age and

older, an age segment expected

to expand over the next several
decades, putting even more

_ strain on the health care system.

Approximately 70 percent are
ﬁrst treated in the emergency
department, making it an ideal
setting for a heart failure clinical

‘ decision guideline to help phy-

sicians identify low-risk patients
who could be treratedat home, as
much less costly alternative.
Pitt researchers sought to
build a clinical decision guideline
based on data collected from the
emergency department to iden-
tify patients with heart" failure

who are at low risk of inpatient
death or serious medical com-
plications. Based on more than
33,000 cases, they developed a
guideline that identiﬁed nearly
16 percent as low risk.
“Treatments for heart failure
can improve the quality of life
for people with this condition
but cannot stop the progression.
The number of patients seeking
treatment in the emergency
department for this disease will
likely spiral upward as the elderly
population continues to grow,”
said Thomas E. Auble, research
assistant professor in the emer-
gency medicine department and
one of the study investigators.
“Variable hospital admission
rates and inaccurate physi-
cian estimates of prognosis for
patients with heart failure suggest
that a clinical prediction rule is
needed to assist providers with
risk assessment and hospitaliza-
tion decisions,” said Donald M.
Yealy, professor and vice chair-
man of emergency medicine and
study investigator. Yealy also is
president of the Society of Aca-
demic Emergency Medicine.
The researchers teamed with
Nlichael J. Fine, associate pro-
fessor of medicine at Pitt, and
members of the University of

Outcomes Research Team that
had used a similar approach to
develop a clinical decision guide-
line for the admission of patients
with community-acquired pneu-
monia. A recently completed
study that implemented the
guideline in emergency depart-
ments in Connecticut and Penn-
sylvania showed 0 that physicians
used it safely to reduce the admis-
sion of low-risk patients.
“Similar success is anticipated
with the new heart failure guide-
lines,” Yealy said.

Bone marrow injections
improve outcomes for children
getting heart transplants

One to ﬁve years after heart
transplantation, children who
had received injections of their
donor’s bone marrow into their
thymus during the surgery had
signiﬁcantly fewer “late” rejec-
tion episodes than children
who received heart transplants
without the addition of the
bone marrow containing donor
immune system cells, according
to a study performed by research-
ers from Pitt’s School of Medi-
cine and Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh.

The children receiving the
injections also required fewer
anti—rejection drugs.

“Our main objective for this
pilotstudy was to prove intra-
thymic injection during ‘heart
transplantation to be both safe
and feasible,” said Steven A.
Webber, a Pitt associate pro-
fessor of pediatrics and medical
director of heart and heart-lung
transplantation at Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh. “But

at follow—up, our ﬁndings also
suggest that this approach is of
beneﬁt to patients as well. The

much lower rate of acute cellu-

lar rejection occurring later than
six months after transplantation
is clearly a positive outcome.
While it is too soon to know,
the lower incidence could make
the children who received intra-
thymic injections less likely to
develop chronic rejection down
the road.” ‘

Chronic rejection, which is
characterized by scarring and
narrowing of the heart’s vessels,
is a major limitation to long—term
survival for heart transplant
patients.

The thymus is located behind _
the breastbone — accessible in
children during heart transplant
surgery — where T cells from

bone marrow are educated to,

distinguish cells of self from
those that are-foreign. It is most
active during infancy and child-
hood; after puberty it begins to
shrink in size. " .
The ‘idea behind infusing

donor bone marrow into the

thymus, as opposed to other 0

sites‘ within the body, is to fool
the recipient’s T cells that are
being educated in the thymus
into thinking that the donor bone
marrow is “self” as well. Those
T cells that would see the donor
tissue as foreign would either die
in the thymus or become weak-
ened. VV1thout these active cells .

New organ preservation
solution easier to use,
more cost-eﬂfective

A new organ preservation
solution offers comparable

results to a solution currently
in use but is more cost-effective
and has logistical advantages that

- makes it more practical for keep-

ing donated livers viable before
transplantation, according to
UPMC researchers.

The researchers compared
Histidine-Tryptophan—Keto—
gluterate (HTK) solution to the
University of Wisconsin (UW)
solution.

Preservation solutions are
used to extend the period that
an organ remains viable. With
current technology, hearts and
lungs can be preserved safely
for 4-6 hours, livers for about
12-18 hours, kidneys about 24
hours.

AccordingtoBijanEghtesad,,
associate professor of surgery at
Pitt’s Thomas E. Starzl Trans-

plantation Institute, outcome ,

measures looking at initial
organ function, the incidence of
primary non-function and other
clinical measures were similar
between the two solutions.

However, HTK’s much lower
viscosity and its biochemical
makeup offer certain advantages
that make it more practical and
easier to use. For instance,
surgeons found it to penetrate
the liver’s vessels and bile duct
structures better.

“While further study is
needed, we believe that this lower

viscosity makes it abetter solu- .

tion to use for livers recovered

Because HTK contains much
less potassium, high levels of
which can cause cardiac arrest,

Researchers hope the ﬁndings

I  Pitt’s School of Medicine, said:

“Our ﬁnding a higher incidence
of a subtype of a certain dendritic
cell in our weaned and nearly
weaned patients is a positive
step toward this goal.”

A Looking for the presence of
different kinds of dendritic cells,
researchers found that patients
off all anti-rejection drugs and
those in the process of drug with-

drawal had signiﬁcantly more of

a beneﬁcial kind of dendritic cell-
and fewer numbers of the more
harmful dendritic cells, a cellular
proﬁle that was similar_to normal,
healthy non-transplant patients
who served as a control group.
Compared to those who required

daily doses of anti—rejection drugs _

—— those who failed at being
weaned or who had a history of
rejection episodes — the patients
off drugs or nearing that target
also had a much higher. ratio of
the good cells to bad cells.
These so—called beneﬁcial
dendritic cells are immature or
precursor dendritic cells that
derive from plasmacytoid T cells
(pDC2). VVhile dendritic cells, a
rare type of white blood cell that

' is presentin all tissues, are usually

known for their ability to identify

and present antigens, or foreign

‘, substances, to other immune

system cells that are programmed
to destroy the antigen, not until
‘recently did researchers identify
subtypes like the pD C2 that have
the opposite effect. These appear
to regulate the immune response
and determine that a frontline
attack against the organ by T
cells is unwarranted.

New protocol could change care
for lung transplant patients
"UPMC surgeons have insti-
tuted a new clinical protocol that
has the potential to redeﬁne the
standard of care for lung trans-
plant patients.
Bucking conventional
thought that successful lung
transplantation can only be

‘achieved with a three-punch

assault onthe immune system,
the new protocol is a departure
from the triple-drug therapy in
place at nearly every other trans
plant center. -

Instead, UPMC surgeons
favor a regimen involving fewer
pills that are given less often
over time. The protocol is an
important achievement for lung
transplant patients, in whom
studies that seek to reduce or
eliminate anti—rejection drugs
are rarely performed out of fear
that the lungs, already the most
vulnerable organ to rejection,
would succumb to an irreversible
immune system attack, placing
patients at risk for death. U U

Ironically, lung recipients
have the greatest incidence
of immunosuppression-related
complications, such as infection
and chronic kidney ‘dysfunction,
providing incentive. to search for
alternative immunosuppression
approaches.

According to Kenneth R.
McCurry, director of lung and
heart-lung transplantation at
UPMC, 18 of 20 patients are
doing well taking lower-than-
normal doses of one mainstay
anti—rejection drug, tacrolimus,
as opposed to the usual three-
drug combination that is given
twice a day.

Two patients died, one of a
common complication associated
with nonfunction of the organ,
and the other from causes that
have yet to be determined. VVhile
eight of the 18 currently remain
on a twice—a—day regimen of
the single drug, ﬁve are taking
tacrolimus once a day and ﬁve
just four times a week. In addi-
tion, all 18 patients are on a daily
5 —milligram dose of prednisone, a
negligible dose compared to the
more typical 20 milligram dose
that is usually given.

“The reason the lung
transplant patients are taking
low—dose prednisone, unlike
the other organ recipients at
UPMC, is because the major-
ity were taking steroids prior
to their transplants and abrupt
discontinuance would likely
lead to adrenal insufﬁciency,”
explained McCurry, who also is
assistant professor of surgery at
Pitt’s School of Medicine.

The clinical protocol, devel-
oped by Thomas E. Starzl and
the Pittsburgh team, is based on
two principles: pre-treatment of
the recipient and the administra-
tion of as little immunosuppres-
sion as possible.

Comparing outcomes of the
20 patients to 15 patients who
were treated using conventional
triple-drug therapy before the
new protocol was introduced,
acute rejection rates were com-
parable. But, suppressing acute
rejection was never meant to
be a goal of the protocol, says

. the transplant team. .The sur-

geons believe that some level of
immune activation is needed for
long-term organ acceptance and
fault conventional approaches

‘that “over-immunosuppress”

patients for inhibiting this acti-
vation process. 4
While it is too soon to gauge
whether chronic rejection rates
will be less in these patients,
that certainly is the hope, said
McCurry. Chronic rejection is
the most common cause of death
for lung recipients beyond two to
three years of transplantation.
“At this point, many of our
patients are doing extremelywell

on low levels of immunosuppres-

sion and we have strong evidence
that this approach may be very
beneﬁcial to patients,” McCurry
said. “Even reducing the steroids
in these patients is a somewhat
remarkable feat, since so—called
steroid sparing has only been
successful in kidney and liver
recipients.”

Since July 2001, more than
550 transplant patients receiv-
ing kidney, liver, pancreas, small
intestine or lung transplants at
UPMC have been treated under
the new protocol.

Triple-drug
therapy
does not
seem to raise
cholesterol in
men with HIV

Treatment with highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART),
commonly known as triple-drug
therapy, does not appear to
raise cholesterol levels in men
with human immunodeﬁciency
virus (HIV), according to Pitt
researchers.

These ﬁndings, published in

the June 11 issue of the Journal

of theAmericanMedicalAssocia-
tion, help to clarify a controver-
sial issue that has been debated
since the advent of HAART seven
years ago. .

“Increases in blood lipid levels

have been widelyreported in HIV
patients treated with HAART, but
until now there were no studies
that included patients’ lipid levels

taken before they were infected

with HIV,” said study author
Sharon A. Riddler, assistant
professor in the Pitt Department
of Medicine’s infectious diseases
division. “VI/"ith access to such
unique data, we were able to look
at lipid levels across a broader
spectrum in time and determine
that after three years of HAART,
the average total cholesterol and
LDL cholesterol levels appear to
be about where they were before
HIV infection.” '

The researchers used data
from the Multicenter AIDS
Cohort Study (MACS), an
ongoing 19-year-old National
Institutes of Health—funded
study of homosexual and bisexual
men that has enrolled 5,622 par-
ticipants, both HIV—positive and

HIV-negative, in Pittsburgh, Bal-
timore, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Participants visit the study clinics
every six months for an interview,
physical examination andcollec—
tion of blood samples.

For this study, researchers
analyzed lipid levels of 50 MACS
participants from whom blood
samples were available from each
of the following points in time:
before HIV infection (presero—
conversion), after infection but
before initiation of HAART, at
two points during HAART
between 1997 and 1999 and
at two points during HAART
between 2000 and 2002.

“The results confirmed
that yes, total cholesterol does
increase with HAART,” Riddler
said, “butin most cases it increases
back to or near the pre-infection
level, and in that sense it repre-
sents a return to normal.” Riddler
cautioned that it is possible the
study results were affected by the
timing of the analyses, and that
additional studies are needed to
determine whether a longer dura-
tion of HAART could result in
further increases in cholesterol
levels.

Another concern is the
observation that while total and
LDL lipid levels were relatively
unchanged over three years on
HAART, at the end of the study
the participants’ average triglyc-
eride levels were higher (2 2 5 mg/
dL) and HDL levels were lower
(42 mg/dL) than those in similar-
aged men in the general popula-
tion. In other studies, some HIV
drugs have been associated with
changes in glucose metabolism
and the development of insulin
resistance.

“The fact that average tri-
glyceride and HDL levels were
at unhealthy levels at the com-
pletion of this study raises a red
ﬂag,” said Riddler. “Until more
is known, the current standard
guidelines for treating high cho-
lesterol should be followed. VV1th
the ongoing collection of data
through MACS, we will be able
to look further into the effects
of long-term triple-drug therapy
and continue toreﬁne treatments
for patients with HIV”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Chancellor’s afﬁrinative action award
goes to assistant dean in med school

for the 2003 Chancellor’s

Afﬁrmative Action Award,
third—year medical student
Leon McCrea called the School
of Medicine’s assistant dean for
student affairs and minority
programs “an adviser, mentor,
friend and conﬁdante” to minor-
ity students.

“Dean Davis has created a
space within the hallowed halls of
the medical school where it feels
like home,” McCray wrote.

For those and other accom-

I n nominating Paula K. Davis

plishments, Davis this.week.

became the ﬁrst individuals to

win the Chancellor’s awarh,“

which includes a $2,500 prize.
In previous years, the award went
to programs rather than speciﬁc
Pitt employees.

Davis’s colleagues praised

her for:

0 Leading the medical
school’s efforts to enroll under-
represented minorities (African
Americans, Native Americans,
Mexican Americans, Puerto
Ricans, Pacific islanders an_d
native Alaskans). About 13
percent of Pitt medical students
belong to those groups, up by 30
percent since Davis took ofﬁce in
November 1994. This year, 21 of
145 students in the school’s ﬁrst—
year class are under-represented
minorities.

° Placing minority high‘

school students in a summer pro-
gram through which theyworkin
Pitt clinics and labs, shadowing
physicians and scientists.

° Helping to create a program
that teaches second-year medi-
cal students about issues facing
patients from diverse cultures,

ethnic backgrounds and sexual
orientations.

0 Helping to gain national
recognition for Pitt’s chapter of
the Student National Medical
Association.

Edward Curtiss, associate
dean of admissions and a profes-
sor in the medical school, credited
Davis with forging links between
the school and community phy-
sicians who work with minority
patients.

“She has an ‘unwavering
commitment to ensuring that
the medical ﬁeld is populated
by diverse and culturally com-
petent physicians,” said Chan-

cellor Mark A. Nordenberg, in *

announcing the award at theJune
9 Senate Council meeting. “Her
efforts have been recognized by
her election as the director of the
northeast region of the National
Association ofMedical Educators
for 2004-2005.”

Davis told Council members:
“In a time when the Supreme
Court is considering very serious
challenges to afﬁrinative action,
[the award] makes me want to
push even harder for what I do
on a daily basis by way of recruit-

ing, and workingwith the clean to C

retain, under-represented medi-
cal students.”

She thanked medical Dean
Arthur S. Levine, who also
is senior vice chancellor for
Health Sciences, for “continued

’ and unwavering siipportin a time

when dollars_ are tight and some
medical’ schools have actually
done away with their minority
affairs programs.” _
Stingy state funding for
medical education remains a

nagging problem, Davis said
after the meeting. Pitt ranks
72nd among 76 public medical
schools nationwide in the amount
of state assistance it receives. “As
the costs. of medical education
escalate,” Davis said, “students
increasingly are being forced
to decide where they would like
to get their educations based on
ﬁnances rather than on the cur-
riculum and environment that
best ﬁt them.”

Pitt’s medical school estab-
lished its ofﬁce of student affairs
and minority programs in 1979.
“According to the dossier that was

submitted [nominating Davis for ’

the afﬁrinative action award], ini-
tially the ofﬁce was successful,”
Chancellor Nordenberg said.
“But when Dean Davis joined it
in November 1994, she inherited
a program that was perceived as
inaccessible by the students it was
created to serve.”

Vl/"ithin ﬁve months of taking
ofﬁce, Davis “formed a bond
with minority student leaders
and hosted the ﬁrst minority
weekend at the medical school,”
Nordenbergsaid. “That weekend
has led to .a series of programs
instrumental in encouraging
under-represented minority stu-
dents to "enroll at the University
of Pittsburgh.”

In accepting her award,
Davis thanked colleagues from
her office (assistant Carol
Blackman, outreach coordina-
tor Robert Connamacher and

assistant director Franki VV1l-
liams), mentors (Pitt admissions
and ﬁnancial aid director Betsy
Porter and her predecessor, Joe
Merante, as well as former associ-
ate director VVilliam Nunn), and
academic advisers who served as
role models (the English depart-
ment’s Fiore Pugliano, the late
Fred Koloc of the College of
Arts and Sciences, and Randy
Williams of communications).
Davis also thanked family
members “who spend a lot of
hours without me while I take
care of other people,” and who
attended the Senate Council
meeting: husband Eric Davis and
children Kathryn and Jason; sis-
ters Lisa Wilds, Christina Vi/"ilds
and Anita Socci; and uncle John
Wilds, director of Community
and Governmental Relations.
