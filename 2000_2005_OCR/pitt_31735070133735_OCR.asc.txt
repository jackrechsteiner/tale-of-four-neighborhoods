Students speak about rac relations

Pennsylvania House committee on education
solicits feedback from students in open forum

CHRIS GRISWOLD
For The Pitt News

The education committee of the
Pennsylvania House of
Representatives met Thursday in the
William Pitt Union to hear panel dis-
cussions and student testimonials con-
cerning racial profiling on
Pennsylvania campuses.

The committee initiated the hear-
ing as part of ongoing activity initiated
by House Resolution Number 139. The
resolution, introduced in April 2001,
directs the committee to “investigate

any alleged or reported incidents relat-

ing to racial relations and any appro-
priate responses there to occurring on
the campuses of the Commonwealth’s
colleges and universities” and report
their ﬁndings.

“Racial tension does exist on this
campus, and it is exhibited in a number
of ways, particularly through racial
profiling by Pitt police, and also in the
classroom,” said Student Government
Board member Michelle Agostini.

SGB defines racial profiling -as

person’s contact with the legal and/or
administrative system that is based
upon racial or ethnic stereotypes and
that has the effect of treating a person
of a minority group differently than
that of the non-minority.”

Agostini said racial tension has
increased since Sept. 11, citing an inci-
dent in which a construction worker
beat up a Pitt student of Pakistani
descent.

She provided a packet, including
information articles concerning race
relations and profiling from the past
year, screen captures from a controver-
sial Pitt student—run Web site and testi-
monials written by students.

The testimonials focused on stu-
dent claims of inequality in the theater
department’s choice of curriculum and
productions, as well as comments
made by professors in classrooms. '

“A professor once asked if I [had
attention deficit disorder], he would
always belittle me in class, and asked
one of my white friends ‘ifI was OK,”’
Kimberly Kay Dillon wrote. “After I

received 100s on my test, he apolo-

SGB to Pitt: Make same-sex decisions known soon

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

It has been six years since former Pitt professor
Deborah Henson sued the University for failing to
provide same-sex health care benefits to her part.-
ner. It has been eight months since the suit entered
a moratorium, pending the announcement of a
Chancellor’s committee’s findings on the issue.

According to Rainbow Alliance President and
Student Government Board member Sandra Telep,
that’s too long.

“The movement has been dormant for a long
time,” Telep said.

In an attempt to re-energize student activism
supporting the issue, and to mirror a similar reso-
lution adopted by the Faculty Senate earlier this
month, Telep and board member Kerianne Ludwig
sponsored and helped pass SGB Resolution 0011.

The resolution, authored by students Joshua
Ferris and Sean Rowley, begins by charging the

University with discriminating against its gay, les-
bian, bisexual and transgender employees by not
providing them with the health care benefits their
heterosexual counterparts receive.

It continues, citing a 1997 study showing that
adding benefits to the budget would raise overall
health insurance costs by less than 0.5 percent.

After quoting the Pitt diversity statement —

“The University of Pittsburgh, as an educational"

institution and as an employer, values equality of

opportunity, human dignity, and racial/ethnic and

cultural diversity. Accordingly, the University pro-
hibits and will not engage in discrimination or
harassment on the basisof  sexual orientation 
Further, the University will continue to take affir-
mative steps to support and advance these values
consistent with the University’s mission” — the
resolution formally calls on the University to “treat
all employees equally” and to provide health care
benefits to all of its employees and their partners.
Finally, the resolution asks for the chancellor’s

committee charged with identifying the plausibili-
ty of same-sex benefits to provide its interim
report.

According’ to University spokesman Robert
Hill, the committee will release its findings" “by the
end of the semester.” He maintains that the com-
mittee is not late with its report, and that contrary
to what some have said, the group never had a due
date in the first place. .

In June, Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg
appointed 12 people to the committee, with the
responsibility of studying whether the University
should begin offering the benefits.

Telep has high expectations for the resolution,
which passed unanimously at Monday’s weekly
meeting. '

“The administration can’t just ignore this,” she
said. “They really need to take immediate action.”

also expects big things. “[This reso-
lution should] move this up as an
item of urgency-in the agenda,” he
said.

He said he hopes the resolution
proves to the administration that the
movement has support rooted not just
in the faculty and staff community,
but the student community as well.

Both hope the resolution serves
as a call to arms for student activists.

Alex said the board might elect
to become involved in future pro-
jects. One initiative Telep has
already undertaken is writing a letter
to Nordenberg to formally inform
him of the resolution and its purpose.

Resolution authors Ferris and
Rowley are also co-chairs of a new,
unnamed group at Pitt aiming to fur-
ther the pro-benefits movement on
campus. The group met Wednesday
night to discuss its options now that
Resolution 11 has passed.

“This was just the first step to get
the ball rolling,” Alex said.

Pitt philosophers rip ranking survey

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

Four Pitt professors recently
expressed their concern with a study
ranking graduate philosophy pro-
grams by signing an open letter to
the study’s author, a professor at the
University of Texas in Austin.

The study in question, titled,
“The Philosophical Gourmet
Report,” surveyed philosophy
departments in what its subtitle
describes as “the English—speaking
world,” ranking them according to
the quality of the faculty. According
to the report, Brian Leiter, the direc-
tor of Austin’s Law and Philosophy
program, published the report in
order to guide prospective students.

But the study has drawn criti-
cism from prominent members of the
philosophy community. Though Pitt
professor James Allen called the
report “honest and well-meaning,”
he cautions that “there is something
misleading about a [ranked] list.”

Allen also emphasized that the
study is an amateur survey .of a
departments, based on statistics and

not quantifiable facts. “It would be .

similar to [someone] putting out a
newsletter about growing roses or

raising prize Pekinese.”

Allen, along with John

I McDowell, Michael Thompson and

Mark Wilson, all full-time profes-
sors at Pitt’s philosophy department,
signed a letter written by Harvard
professor Richard Heck. This letter,
issued Jan. 7 and sent to Leiter,
states that the “Philosophical
Gourmet Report “does a disservice
to the many undergraduates who

. consult it  by providing informa-

tion of doubtful relevance.”

As of Feb. 14, the letter had 253
signatories about a quarter of whom
read the letter posted online.

Allen said that the Pitt profes-
sors decided to show their support
independently, that it was “n_ot a col-
lective decision” and that it was “by
no means representative of the
department.” '

Professors from other universi-
ties have also expressed their dissat-
isfaction with the report. In addition
to the Heck—penned letter, William
Ewald, a professor of law'and phi-
losophy at the University of
Pennsylvania, issued his own _17-
page objection to “The
Philosophical Gourmet Report.” In
his letter he said, “.1” have serious
reservations about his philosophy

rankings.” .

Peter Klein, a Rutgers professor,
called the report informative. In a
letter to Blackwell Publishers, who
published the report, he wrote,
“Because of the report, a department
in aluniversity like  Arizona or
Pittsburgh _ has a much better
chance of being appreciated.

Despite Allen’s and others’
opposition to the study, Pitt was
named one of the best graduate
departments in the country, called
excellent for its studies of
metaethics, the philosophy of sci-

ence, philosophical logic and
Wittgenstein," a Viennese-born
British philosopher.

The report also specifically cited
McDowell as “among the most
prominent philosophers at work,

today.” McDowell declined to com-’

ment on the report.

Still, the report cautions that this
ranking is solely for~-the graduateé
program. “Pittsburgh, may have an
outstanding philosophy" department,
but it might make more sense for a
good student  to do,_ his or her
undergraduate work  where stu-

ident-faculty ratios are more favor-

able, and where there is a stronger

' focus on ‘undergraduate education.”

gized and said that he stereotyped and
misjudged me.”

Corinne Menoher wrote, “Students
notice that the people who serve their
food in the dining halls are one color,
while the people who command
respect by their accomplishments (our
professors) are another color.”

Several wrote about being

searched by police for drug possession, ,

while searching none of their white
friends present. Others questioned the
number of police at black—themed
events and wrote about police dispers-
ing their groups immediately following
activities in the William Pitt Union.
Panelist Vic Walczak, the execu-
tive director of the Pittsburgh chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union,
said that one obstacle facing the com-

mittee is that discrimination" is often

difficult to prove.

“Just as with racial proﬁling in law
enforcement, there is the perception by
many people of color that campus
security officers, administrators and
other employees discriminate against
minorities,” Walczak said. “The per-

. ception often extends to Women, gay

men _and lesbians and minority, ethnic
and religious groups.”

According to Walczak, the percep-
tion “undermines schools’ reputations
for fairness, decency and excellence.”

He added that schools must prove 

the problem no longer exists, empha-
sizing gathering data and statistics to
see the trends.

, “If statistical evidence reveals no
problems,” he added, “then the schools
will be armed with evidence to dispel

the perception that they discriminate.”

The SGB resolution is not enough

Actions may speak louder than
words, but sometimes it’s just easi-
er to pass a resolution. 1

Take Pitt’s Student Government
Board, for example. This week,
when faced with the tough same-
sex benefits issue, they decided to
play the role of professional politi-
cians, unleashing their wrath in the
form of a delicately phrased politi-
cal document. But this predicament
has demanded the University’s
attention for years, and it will take
more than a piece of paper to force
a decision.

In 1996, Pitt legal writing
instructor Deborah Henson filed a
lawsuit against the University. The
reason: Pitt refused to provide her
lesbian partner with health insur-
ance coverage. Last spring — five
years, six plaintiffs and countless
hours of litigation later — the
administration showed signs of
cooperation.

On May 22, Chancellor
Nordenberg announced the forma-
tion of a committee to research the
practicality of extending health care
benefits to the partners of gay or
lesbian employees. At the time, it
seemed like a big step forward. The
end was finally in sight.

But today, a full 10 months
later, the committee’s interim report

is nowhere to be found.

Chancellor Nordenberg has
washed his hands of the whole
thing, saying that he does not want
to “intrude” in the committee’s
activity. In response, SGB passed
their resolution calling on the
Chancellor’s committee to release
its findings.

The resolution is a step in the
right direction, but it comes very
late in a poker game that has been
shady from the beginning. The
Chancellor is stalling, and it’s time
for him to show his cards.

SGB’s less-than-aggressive
approach to this ridiculous situation
indicates how" low it sits on the
board’s list of priorities. If it truly
mattered to them, they would drop
the formalities, pick up the posters
and hit the Cathedral Lawn.

This issue, now entering its
sixth year, has been pushed aside
and delayed for long enough. It has
been examined by everyone from
the American Civil Liberties Union
to the Pennsylvania State.
Legislature. The decision that is
reached here may affect court
precedents nationwide. A simple
letter to the Chancellor is not
enough. The SGB must take action,
because its words are falling» on
deaf ears.

Harlem.

In a period when blacks weren’t
welcome at the white-owned stores
and establishments downtown, the
people of the ‘Hill could find almost
everything they needed» in their own
community.

' The building of the Civic Arena
not only wrecked homes and busi-

and socially isolated from the rest
of the city. But in the first half of
‘the 20th century, the Hill was a
prospering, vibrant community.
Wylie Avenue, the main com-
mercial artery, used to run from a
church in the upper Hill all the way
to Downtown. Numerous black-
owned businesses lined the street,

develop the career skills to pursue

experience the Hill of the Wylie
Avenue days. Life in the Hill
District changed drastically in
1956, when the demolition of hous-
es and businesses began to make
way for the Civic Arena.

Planning for the Civic Arena
began years before the actual demo-
lition. Pittsburgh in the mid to late
1940s and early 1950s was not a
scenic town. The steel industry was
experiencing a decline and the
economy was taking a downward
spin, though a gray cloud of smog
continued to envelope the city.

In an effort to revitalize the
community, bank mogul Richard
Mellon founded the Allegheny
Conference on Community
Development in 1943. Twenty-four
other local business leaders — not
surprisingly, all white and all ‘male
—— joined the Conference.

The group was nonpartisan, but
worked closely with Democratic
mayor-David Lawrence to collabo-
rate on community improvement
projects, starting with smoke and
ﬂood control and the development
of the Golden Triangle at Point
Park. _

One member of the Conference,

   
   
  
       
      

JVawoliawingintfie(3anheg;./I/L.7{irn£ia(}aE€e2a;

Edgar J. Kaufmann of the
Kaufmann’s department stores, was
enamored with the idea of building
a public
retractable roof. The Conference
released a plan for this in 1953, and
the following year, the city estab-

lished the Public Auditorium
Authority.
The Public Auditorium

Authority set . its sights on the
Lower Hill as the ideal spot for con-
struction of the new arena. It was
close to the newly revitalized busi-
ness district Downtown. More
importantly, the predominantly
white Urban Renewal Authority had
declared the Lower Hill blighted in
1950, despite the numberiof black-
owned businesses that thrived there
and the plethora of ‘affordable hous-
mg.
With the area declared as blight-
ed, the Public Auditorium Authority
was able, to acquire the land via
eminent domain. Consequently, the
destruction of not only buildings,
but a way of life, began.

This happened almost 50 years
ago, and even if the Civic Arena
were demolished to make way for a
new rink for the Penguins, as‘ the
team has clamored for, the damage
could no_t be easily reversed.

In such situations, the undoing

Issues of urban redevelopment

and renewal are still relevant today, ‘

and it’s important to be aware of the
patterns and prejudices.

When I think of how the demo-
lition of the Lower Hill occurred —
how white government leaders and
businesspeople claimed the rights
to a black community — the power
dynamics of the situation becomes
clear. It’s Belgians in the Congo,
it’s the Dutch claiming South Africa

as their own, just on a microcosmic

level.

Following the construction of
the Civic Arena, members of the
Hill District community mobilized
to halt the city from acquiring more
upper Hill property for further so-
called renewal.

“Life” is inappropriate

I am writing today because I am
deeply disappointed by the Pitt
Program Council’s decision to
“Celebrate Black History Month”
with a midnight showing of “Life”

’ (starring Eddie Murphy and Martin

Lawrence). Anyone with knowledge
of the story line knows why I’m
upset. This movie is nothing more
than a slapstick comedy about two
black men who have spent the better
years of their life incarcerated. Now
don’t get me wrong, when it comes
to this campus, I don’t celebrate any-
thing unless I get a day off. But,
being a young black male, it disturbs
me that the Pitt Program Council
would choose to “celebrate” Black
History with a movie that depicts the
life of two black men in jail for
LIFE? I commend the Pitt Program
Council for trying to provide recre-
ational activities, and even celebrat-
ing Black History Month, but I’m
disappointed.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2002

Of all the stupid questions I have
ever been asked, there is but one I
always know the answer to. What lit-
erary character would I_like to be?

Perhaps it’s telling of my person-
ality to revealthat I have always been
enamored with Franny Glass, the
female protagonist in J .D. Salinger’s
“Frarmy and Zooey.” I admire her
boredom with her pretentious acade-
mic surroundings, her naive search
for wisdom, her family’s overstuffed
sitting room, her cool _and laid—back
brother Zooey and her remarkable’ A
family. The word “Salingeresque” exists for a reason.

There are, of course, other similar protagonists with
whom I feel I can especially. relate. For example, I also I
enjoyed the movie “Amelie.” In the midst of my current -
apartment searching, I can’t‘help but imagine myself into a
quirkily furnished apartment just as reﬂective of my charm-
ing personality as Amelie’s adorable ﬂat in Montmarte is of
hers.

But thinking along these lines is dangerous.

It’s one point to enjoy certain characters, to want to emu-
late their positive or unique attributes, and even to feel as
though you know them better than ﬂesh. But admiration for
inhabitants of the second dimension can lead to trouble.

People of my generation have fallen into the trap of
admiring characters instead of real people. We lose ourselves
in movies every week, and the people who ﬁll the pages of
modern writing occupy the spaces in our minds. By exten-
sion, we’ve also become extremely self-centered and self-
indulgent; it’s as though suddenly, we’re thinking of ourselves
as characters that other people are interested in.” ,

Writers such as Dave Eggers are a perfect example of
this. With “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,”
Eggers basically writes his memoir at a ridiculously young
age. Although I devoured his every word — even the ones in
the page—long footnotes — I’m wary of this sort of writing
becoming wildly popular. It’s signiﬁcant when other young
writers who haven’t accomplished anything of particular note
begin to borrow his style. The current trend of keeping an
online journal is a definitive example.

Perceiving yourself as a character is not only pretentious
— after all, why would you be interested in my life? — but it '
causes real people to become two-dimensional.

Two-dimensional people can only tackle the conﬂicts
their creators have them able to conquer. Frarmy Glass only
exists inside the 200-some pages of a paperback, and Amelie
has already fulﬁlled her destiny.

But the biggest problem with portraying yourself as a
mere character is that it’s false. You’re hiding the real you, the
one who other people might not really be all that interested in,
the one behind the mask and the make-up, who’s not restrict-
ed to the facade of a character.

Time will consistently test the idea that life is
stranger than fiction, and even the strangest character from
the most bizarre novel you can imagine wouldn’t be able to
deal with some of the screwballs life pitches.

But then again, what do I know? I’m the one writing in
the first person.

John Q.
Starring Denzel Washington,
Duvall and Anne Heche

Directed by Nick Cassavetes

-STEVE CAPANNA‘
Staff Writer

“John Q.” is a movie with a message:
Universal healthcare is good! HMOs and rich doc-
tors are soulless, moneygrubbing monsters! In
fact, all rich people are evil! Unfortunately, “John
Q.” doesn’t bother to take the time to be as subtle
as I just was.

The plot is prettysimple. A blue-collar couple
in severe ﬁnancial difﬁculty discovers that their
son Michael’s heart is three sizes too big. (Get it ——
the working class has too much heart?) If he does-
n’t get a transplant soon, he will die.:But their
insurance doesn’t cover it, they can’t afford it and
the hospital won’t do it for free so the father, John
Q. (Denzel Washington) takes the emergency
room hostage until they agree to give Michael a

V heart

Now, it’s not that I mind movies with a mes-

sage. It’s just that I like when they respect the audi-
ence enough to think they might ﬁgure it out for
themselves. Instead, “John Q.” is filled with stilted

scenes contrived to ﬁnd a way to let its characters A

spout more anti-HMO -rhetoric. .

For instance, when Eddie Griffin
(“Double Trouble”) riffs, “Hippocratic Oath?
More like hypocritical oath.” That sure showed the
medical profession!

Even the cops criticize the system. When
hostage negotiator Robert Duvall discovers that
two people that work in the hospital aren’t work-
ing that day, he says, “Does anyone work in this
hospital?” “It’s Saturday,” explains a security
guard. “So what? Don’t people get sick on
Saturday?” Yeah! How dare hospital employees
get a day off!

But let’s assume that you aren’t too critical
and can get over the soap boxing. Unfortunately,
you’re still not left with a very good movie. When
a still-healthy Michael inexplicably reprimands his
father at the beginning of the movie, “Not good-
bye. I hate goodbye.‘ See you later, remember?”
who can doubt that we will see that said again,
only in a much more dramatic setting?

The only good moments in the ﬁlm come
when Washington gets to break free of the cum-
bersome script and show off his enormous talent.
His acting is absolutely wonderful and almost
redeems the ﬁlm. -He made me forget (brieﬂy) how
pissed off I was at being lectured. But he doesn’t
get enough opportunities to really shine to make
this propaganda worth watching.

lmprisoning racism
Han"s War

Starring Bruce Willis,

_Colin Farrell

Directed by Gregory Hoblit
area

Segregation within the armed forces

isn’t typical World War H ﬁlm fare. The ﬁlm- -

makers of “I-Iart’s War,” make it their focus.
Lt Tom Hart (Colin Farrell), the son of
a senator, has been conﬁned to a desk during

the war. He is captured during a routine oﬂi— ‘

cer transport and thrown into Stalag VI with

other American forces led by the bitter Col: 

McNamara (Bruce Willis). ‘
At this point, any other ﬁlm would
devolve into Hart redeeming himself as a

‘ soldier during the planning and act of escap-

ing, coming out of his desk jockey shell,
while teaching McNamara not to be so hard-
nosed. When they break out of the camp,
they would run hand in’ hand through the

 forests of Germanyto freedom, with 

American ﬂag waving the whole way.

. Instead, “I-Iart”s War” deals with the dis-
graceful court martial of a Tuskegee Airman
who is accused of ‘ killing a racist sergeant
The ﬁlm deals more with the racism of lead-
ers within the military,‘ like McNamara, and

A what that means for how missions are con-

ducted and the honor in victory when such
racism is present.

With this idea in mind, the ﬁlmmakers
extend the meaning of being a prisoner of
war beyond the literal. Certainly, these men

are prisoners of the Nazis, but they can move
freely during the day and even hold an
American court martial inside Nazi walls.
But those like the Tuskegee Airmen, who are
 against yet fought for their
country, are prisoners of hate within their

own ranks. As one of the Airmen points out, .
Nazi POWS held in Georgia have more -

rights than the black veterans, soldiers and

. citizens.

. -Much in the ﬁlm isn’t what it appears to
be. McNamara might be more than he
seems, there arequestions of the legitimacy
of the court martial, and there are always bits
of infonnation that Hart and the audience
aren’t privy to. Even the setup of the ﬁlm

‘lulls the audience into thinking it will be a

typical POW ﬁlm
The audience has to be engaged in the
ﬁlm, to look deeper than the surface, to ﬁnd

out how the answer to one question relates to

the answer of another and to question what
is shown. This builds up a great deal of sus-
pense andtension right up to the conclusion.
This evokes a deﬁnite feel that harkens back

' to a bygone era of ﬁlrnrrraking when it was

OK to have meaningful character dramas set
against the horrors of war and have them be
more important than the horrors of poorly
timed, obtrusive explosions.

 “Hart’s War” is a breath of resuscitative
fresh air in the lungs of the dying World War
II ﬁlm genre. It never succumbs to contem-
porary convention, content to focus on an
issue of the war that other modern World
War II movies are unable or unwilling to
deal With.

Digging up dirt
atthe Warhol

Andy Warhol’s diaries dig up a lot of
good dirt, and not just on himself. His very

- scandalous published diaries spilled the

beans on all kinds of celebrities — one even
ended in a lawsuit.

Excerpts from this 1989 best seller,
along with newly discovered handwritten
diary pages, will be presented this Friday in
honor of the 15tl1 anniversary of
Warhol’s death.

The unpublished diary ..
pages were recently discovered
from one of Warhol’s own time
capsules. Mail, photographs, ,
artwork by himself and others and
gifts from friends are tucked away in
more than 600 cardboard boxes Warhol calls
“time capsules.” 1

Warhol began keeping diaries in 1972
to keep a record of his business expenses for
tax  He would record conversa-
tions with people he met, impressions of
what he saw, and then throw in: cab $7 and
lunch $10.

His decisions to begin a diary may
have been inﬂuenced by his good friend,
fashion photographer Peter Beard, who kept

  
  
 
 
  

a diary his whole life.

But according to Matt Wrbican,
Assistant Archivist at the Warhol, “everyone
likes to give themselves credit for giving
Warhol an idea” ‘

These handwritten pages, which would
be 15-20 pages typed, document his trip to
Venice and Paris in 1973, three years before
the published diaries began. They describe
his travels and his reason for being in
Europe: a fabulous Brandolini family ball in
Venice. It was attended by 1,200 guests,

including Audrey Hepburn, Princess

Grace of Monaco; Yves St
 Laurent and Bianca Jagger,
who later sued Warhol for
exposing her secrets.
Readings from the pub-

according to theme, one cantering on
Truman Capote, Warhol’s longtime friend.
Warhol was an “insider to the people,”
Wrhican explains. “He was an observer of
his culture.” But after the publication of this
trusted information, Warhol rrrade a lot of
enemies.
This very intimate reading will begin at
7 p.rn. at the Warhol’s Good Fridays Event
and is ﬁee to the public. This may be the
only time these unrevealed pages will be
read, so come see what Warhol dug up.

The face of metal is always changing.

Back in the ‘80s, hair metal was the
deﬁning birth-child of metal. Everyone
knew Poison and Winger, and it was hitting
the mainstream. . .big time‘.

In the ‘90s, a newer form of metal
developed. Bands like Kom, Limp Bizkit
and the Deftones introduced a new genre of
metal that wasn’t quite mainstream yet. It
was called “nu-me .” Mushroomhead,
an eight-piece nu-metal band from
Cleveland is set to rock Club Laga tonight.
Their supporting acts may be a bit of a sur-
prise.
Lamb of God is a purely metalcore
band, a bloody marriage of metal and hard-
core elements, sure to draw in the hardcore
scenesters and metalheads alike. Another
magniﬁcent (and less well—known band)
called Eighteen Visions hailing ﬁom Orange
County, Ca, will also be present.

Eighteen Visions almost seems to be out
of place here. Orange County is always pro-

see how bands that aren’t necessarily of the
same direct genre get included to the bill
today.

Back to Mushroomhead. The band has
been around since before the now-popular
nu-metal band Slipknot even put out a single
album. In 1995, they released their self-titled
album, and almost six years later, they
released their latest ' eﬂ°ort, XX, a 15-track
elfort album.

You and your stereo might be shocked
to seethetotaltracks nurnber43 onthe dis-
play, but you can always suspect some
shenanigans and hidden tracks from a lot of
bands these days.

The interesting thing about this show is
that admission is $8, and if you hand them a
Jackson (a $20 bill if you didn’t catch the

slang), you get XX (for $10) plus admission »

to the show.

According to J. Mann, lead vocalist for
the band, “Hey, it’s all about making music
affordable again.”

With critical acclaim and a track on the
“Scorpion King” soundtrack, they seem
ready to take the - world by storm.
Mushroomhead will aim to please fans of
metal and nu-metal alike. Let’s just hope
they don’t bring the house down too hard.

Red-hot Rutges coole do

Solid bench play and
defense leads to 78-59 win.

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Rutgers came into the Fitzgerald Field House red-
hot last night after winning six of its last seven games.
But after 40 minutes of basketball, it left the packed
building as just another team that was victimized by
Pitt’s physical play and tough defense, in a 78-59 loss.

“This was another game where we did what we’ve
been doing well all year and that’s defend and rebound,”
head coach Ben Howland said.

Rutgers (17—9 overall, 7-6 Big East) won the open-
ing tip and a layup by Sean Axani‘ gave Rutgers an early
2-0 lead. It would be Rutgers’ last lead of the game.

While Rutgers’ Rashod Kent, the Big East co-Player
of the Week, was badgered and haunted by Donatas
Zavackas’ stiﬂing defense throughout the evening. The
other co-player of the week, Brandin Knight, was direct-
ing his team to Victory.

“Donatas did i a great job defensively, there’s no
doubt about it,” Howland said. “He’s our best post defen-
sive player.” i -

Zavackas" ﬁnished with a game-high 19 points, while
pulling down six rebounds. Knight scored 13 points.

Knight became aggressive early, driving to the hole

and picking up a foul. Knight, who continued his night-

marish season from the line by making just two of nine

Zavackas took it right back down into the paint on
Pitt’s next possession, splitting the defense for an easy
two. Pitt scored 10 of the next 12 points as Knight found
a slashing Chad Johnson to give Pitt a 13-4 advantage.

- But Rutgers, as it did in the teams’ Jan. 8 meeting,
would not go down easily.

A’Mike Sherrod leaner in the lane and two consecu-
tive Juel Wiggan close-range buckets closed the gap to
13-10. '

Rutgers seemed to have trouble responding to Pitt’s
physical play as it found itself in the penalty. with eight

Pitt’s dominant defense and
Donatas Zavackas’ tough defense on
co-Big East Player of the Week
Rashod Kent pushed the men’s bas-
ketball team to a 78-59 win over

last night.

Going into ‘last night’s game,
Kent has been averaging a double
double this season with 10.6 points
and 10.4 rebounds per game.
Zavackas and the Panthers’ defense
held Kent scoreless until approxi-
mately five minutes and 56 seconds
remained in the first half.

“That was the‘ story of the game,”
said sophomore guard Julius -Page.
“Our big men came in and did every-
thing today. You couldn’t ask for
more. You combine their numbers and
it’s like having another Shaq out
there.”

Kent’s poor performance sent him
to the bench with about 10 minutes to
play in the first half.

“He’s a big boy and you have to
give him credit for that.” said
Zavackas, who scored a game-high 19
points while grabbing six rebounds.

Donatas Zavackas scored a game-high
19 points against Rutgers last night.

Rutgers at the Fitzgerald Field House

Ontario Lett and freshman forward ,

Chevon Troutman held Kent to just
four points and one rebound for the
remainder of the half.

“We have been doing what we
have been doing all year just rotating
and playing a lot of people,” _Lett

said. “We have pretty good depth on

this team.’ We have some good big
men and we just put him out of the
game.” .

Zavackas, Troutman and Lett‘
continued shutting down Kent in the
second half: Kent had just two points
and five rebounds.

Pitt’s defense held the Scarlet
Knights to four points in the first six
minutes of ‘the game. The Panthers
dominated the boards in the first half
as they out rebounded Rutgers 27-17.

Pitt had 16 rebounds on the
defensive glass, which helped hold

Rutgers to just 12 points going into A

the final eight minutes of the first
half. ' .
The Panthers finished the game
with 46 rebounds compared to the
Scarlet Knights’ 29. The big differ-
ence was that 32 of Pitt’s 46 rebounds.
came on defense while Rutgers only
came up with 15 defensive rebounds.
The Panthers also added 11
blocked shots with Troutman, Page,
senior forward Chad Johnson and

avackas lid on both sides of the ball for Pitt

freshman center Mark McCarroll,
each adding two blocked shots a
piece. '

Following Pitt rebounds, Rutgers
tended to double-team Pitt’s ball han-
dlers, which typically left a Panther
player wide open for an easy layup. 1

“Great things happen when youe
run the court.” Zavackas said.

On more than one occasion,
junior guard Brandin Knight was dou-
ble- or triple—teamed and was able to
dribble out of trouble to find
Troutman for the easy layup.

“We got a little shaky to start the
second half against the press, but we
recovered and started attacking
aggressively,”. said Pitt head coach
Ben Howland. “It ended up hurting
them when they were pressing. We
ended up getting a lot of layups and
uncontested shots.”

Zavackas scored eight of his 19
points in the first half and then
exploded in the second half for 11
points. -

Donatas is our best defender on
the post. He’s [Zavackas] pretty
tough,” Lett said. .

Zavackas dominated both on

offense and defense as he finished i_

with his largest contribution since he
scored 19 points against St. Francis
back on Dec. 29.

Pitt too physical for Rutgers squad

Rutgers romp, page 9

cushion quickly behind a Chevon
Troutman three-pointer and ﬁve free
throws to move ahead 21-13.

Pitt (23—4, 11-3) had been driving into
the lane throughout the game, thus forc-
ing the Rutgers defense to collapse. Up
21-13, Johnson took his turn going into
the lane and as his layin fell off of the rim,
center Toree Morris was there to throw
down the miss and nearly rip the rim off
of the glass.

Rutgers began to press, but Knight
made his way out of several double and
triple teams, ﬁnding wide-open team-
mates in the lane "for easy layins. Pitt
outscored Rutgers 52-34 in the paint for
the game.

Though Pitt made just one tl1ree-
pointer in the ﬁrst half, it took a healthy
35-23 lead into the half. Pitt held Rutgers
to just 32 percent shooting from the ﬂoor
in the ﬁrst half. Zavackas kept Kent’s out-
put to just four points and a rebound in the
half. Kent averages a double double for
the season.

Pitt wasted no time in the second half
as Knight opened up with an immediate
three-pointer to put Pitt ahead by 15.

Once again, Rutgers fought back as it
went on an 11-0 run thanks to a press that
forced eight points off of turnovers.

“We were getting back into it by

pressing but then they did a better job of
beating it and then they became aggres-
sive again,” Rutgers head coach Gary
Waters said. ‘”I’hey’d have to be up there
as one of the most physical teams in the
Big East.”

\V1th Rutgers striking and within four
points of the lead at 38-34, Zavackas
found Julius Page for a soaring slam.

The unselﬁsh aspect of Pitt’s game is
what has led it to 23 wins and it was
exempliﬁed last night at the sold-out
Field House. Pitt doubled Rutgers’ assist
total, dishing out 18 feeds against
Rutgers’ nine.

Up by a score of 42-38, Pitt contin-
ued the feeding frenzy as Knight dished
an assist to Zavackas for a layin, followed
by a Zavackas pass down low to
Troutman in the post for two -— extending
the lead to eight. .

As it has been so many times this sea-
son, Knight was the difference. As

Howlandsaid, “It all starts with Brandin.” V

It was Knight’s breaking of the
Rutgers press that eventually shattered
Rutgers’ _chances of making it a game.
Ahead 46-40, Knight scored six of Pitt’s
next eight points while assisting on a

Troutman dunk to put Pitt ahead‘ by 10,

56-46.

Troutman ﬁnished with eight points
and seven rebounds, while Knight put up
13 points, eight assists and six rebounds.

(MATT FRANI.(iLiIN/’I.’H0’T0 EDITOR

Pitt’s Chevy Troutman put up eight
points and seven rebounds last night.

The Zavackas show iced the game for ..

Pitt as he either scored or assisted on the
team’s next 11 of 13 points.
An Ontario Lett follow-up slam off of

a Knight miss ignited the" crowd, put.

Rutgers away for good and marked Lett’s
face with a grin from ear to ear.

The Panthers are in action next on
Feb. 26, when the team travels to Seton
Hall. A win at Seton Hall will wrap up the
Big East West title for the Panthers.

Wrestlers wrap
up the regular
season tonight

Wrestling, page 9

pound meeting, Pitt’s Shawn Arnistade
(19-8) will grapple with No. l5—ranked
Cory Ace (14-7), in the 133-pound con-
test.

Pitt grappler Zach Doll (14-6) will
take on Ryan Yates (12-6) in the 157-
pound class and in the 174-pound
match, red—shirt sophomore Matt
Catullo (9-18) will take on No. 2-ranked
Josh Koscheck (9-2). Koscheck is com-
ing off injury and illness, but Flynn is
conﬁdent his wrestler will be well-rest-
ed.

“We’ve had a week and a half off,
everyone should be ready,” Flynn said.

Rounding out the lineup will - be
heavyweights Jacob Lininger (30-9)
and Josh Pearce ( 14-6). Coming off two
losses in a row, Lininger hasn’t had a
win since Feb. 9.

The Panthers and the Fighting Scots
will square off tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
the Fitzgerald Field House. After
tonight’s meet, the Panthers won’t hit
the ﬂoor again until the EWL champi-
onships at Lock Haven on March 9 and
10.
