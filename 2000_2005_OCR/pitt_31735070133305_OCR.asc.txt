VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 65

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

While Operation: Enduring Freedom continues the
assault on the Taliban, a battle over whether the United
States should be in Afghanistan atall continues to rage
on Pitt’s campus.

_ The Pittsburgh Anti~War Coalition, in cooperation

with Pitt’s Students in Solidarity, staged one of the

largest Pitt rallies of the year Friday to protest the

. United States’ military actions in Afghanistan. The
rally, which lasted nearly six hours — from about 1

p.m. to about 7 p.m. -—— peaked in attendance at more
than 300 people as it progressed from the William Pitt

Union patio to Carnegie Mellon University’s Software '
’ Engineering Institute and back again. ’

* V Protestors from Pitt, CMU and other colleges

‘ joined local peace activists from institutions such as

the Thomas Merton Center as they marched through
Oakland, chanting messages such I as “Georgie,
Georgie, can’t you see? You just bombed a refugee!”

 and waving signs that proclaimed the number of starv-

ing people in Afghanistan to be 7.5 million, or 1,500

for every American killed in the-World Trade Center.

attack.

Marchers processed from the Union patio to the
Software Engineering Institute, and then down Craig
Street, where shop and restaurant owners opened their
doors to join passersby in watching the spectacle. The
rally, marched back to the Union along Forbes Avenue
to the sounds of honking from cars. with their windows

Carl Kurlandejr thought- so, and

‘ ""‘St. Elmo’s Fire” was born.

Kurlander, a guest professor in Pitt’s
English department, gave a free screen-

Students and faculty were given a

.famous ‘80s movie came to life.
“Basically, I wanted to do a movie
about my generation,” Kurlander said.

i;According to Kurlander, it all began i called “St. -Elmo’s Fire.” The story was

Poet bases work on life, but not her own

TRAVIS REAL
Staff Writer

Thursday evening, students and
faculty heard from speakers whose
life stories are as disparate as their
backgrounds.

A colonial woman talked of cap-
ture by a Sioux Indian, and his sub-
sequent execution by the law despite
her pleas that they spare him.

A West African man spoke about
white savages on the American
coast.

An angry woman remembered
her once youthful, lustful husband
who had become “outdated and piti-
ful as a lame hear.”

The characters were born from
the mind of poet Lisa Chavez.
T-hroughrher readings, they all had a
chance to speak.

Chavez spoke at Carnegie
Mellon University as part of the
Visiting Writers Series, which pre-
sents a different writer every month.
She is a self-described.“Chicana
mestiza writer, teacher and traveler.”

She was raised in Fairbanks,
Alaska, which served as the inspira-
tion for her first book of poetry,
“Destruction Bay.” She has written
for various magazines and antholo-

gies and has recently published a -»

new book of poetry, “In An Angry
Season.” She also teaches at Albion

College in Michigan.
Her works cover
the life of women,
minorities and Native
American culture. In
addition she experi-
ments with styles of
poetry such as prose
poetry, persona
poems, historical
poems and what she
calls “bidding poems.”
“In my class we do
an exercise where the '
students write one line‘
of poetry and then bid
on the best line,” she
said. “The students
then had to write a
poem just based on
that one line. Being
the teacher I got the
least popular line which started out
as, ‘I remember the moment I
stopped being a child.”’ .
From this single line came the
poem “Lost Country,” which is about
a- father’s suicide that thrust his son
into an adulthood he wasn’t ready to
face. Chavez said it was based on a
true story ‘
A The reading was one of many

“My life is
rather boring.
I ﬁnd it much
more exciting
writing about

someone
else is life. ”

Linda Chavez,
poet

readings held every month at CMU
since the Visiting Writer’s Series
started 30 years ago. Professor Jim
Daniels said that
many well-known
writers
the campus in the
past, including poet
Robert Creeley and
Michael Ondaatje,
author of “The
English Patient.”
“Our budget
is limited so we can’t
always afford a real
famous writer. But
we do try to find a

new writer with
potential,” he said.
“We try to invite

them to speak when
they are at an early
stage of their career.
We try to find writers
that show a certain amount of
promise.” He said that Chavez is an
excellent writer who’s bound to be
successful.

Despite the book signing at the
end of the evening, Chavez is hum-
ble about her career.

“My life is rather boring,” she
said. “I find it much more exciting
writing about someone else’s life.’’

I Take 13 Pitt students,‘ 26 sticks,
150 hours of practice and an audi-
ence of 2,000. Shake and move vig-

_ iorously.

Last Friday, this added up to a
second place finish for the Indian
Sub-Continent Association dance
team in RaasChaos 2001, held at
George Washington University in
Washington, D.C.

The Indian Sub-Continent
Association team battled five other

universities for the honor, beaten’

only by the host team, GWU. Along
with the distinction of second place,
the team -was awarded $500 for its
efforts.

1 Two months ago the team’s
prospects of. winning anything
weren’t very promising.

“Half of us didn’t ‘even know
how to dance,” said team member
Mangala Murthy.

The team experienced another
setback when two members suffered
broken ankles. Daily practices,
some stretching five hours, were

needed to bring the remaining mem-

bers up to par with the competition
at RaasChaos.

The dance of Raas is energetic
and upbeat, characterized by strik-
ing or twirling colorful sticks to
rhythmic music. -

Raas originated in Gujarat,
India, as a 10-day_festiva1 to sym-
bolize good and evil. In some
regions, people dance in the streets
from 8 p.m. to 5 a,m. for nine
straight nights. Performers use
sticks in the dance to symbolize
war.

Pitt’s Indian Student
Association team was the only one
that didn’t drop a single stick during
competition. , ' '

Though some members w_eren’t
confident that the performance
would go well — Murthy wasn’t
sure whether the team would place
at all — the determination to win
still permeated the group.

“I thought to myself, ‘I’m not
leaving here without ‘a trophy,”’
member Dhaval Mehta said. Just a
few yards away rested ISA’s newest
addition: a 2 1/2 foot golden trophy.

Group celebrates Polish heritage

LAURA WILK
Staff Writer

The usually quiet commons room of
the Cathedral of learning was ﬁlled with an
eclectic mix of Polish music, dancing, food
and crafts for the 16th annual Polish festival
yesterday.

“Polish people of Pittsburgh and

‘ Western Pennsylvania have contributed so

much to the city,” said congressman
William Coyne, who attended the festival.
“It’s good to have events that allow the
Polish community to take pride in their her-
itage.” s ‘
The crowd of about 200, dressed in
everything ﬁ‘om jeans to traditional Polish

outﬁts, moved from table to table sampling.

authentic Polish foods like ldﬂles, babka,
kielbasa and peasant breads. The crowd
included several nuns wearing “Not only
am I perfect, I’m Polish too” sweatshirts.

“This is one day out of the year for
Poles and non-Poles to come together and
appreciate the Polish culture,” said
Lawrence Kozlowski, founding festival
director. “Some people look at the tradition-
al food» and- crafts and remember their
grandparents making ﬂrem.”

The audience was entertained with a
live accordion sing—along to songs such as
“There Is No Beer in Heaven,” the
“Chicken Dance” and traditional Polish folk
songs.

Two Polish dance groups also per-
formed in traditional dress. The outﬁts,
called Rzeszow, are colorful vests laced
together with red ribbon matched with mid-
calf length skirts and tall black boots.

The Polonia dance group performed
dances from the Rzeszow region, two cou-
ple dances called Kujawiak and a polka

The audience clapped along as Polonia
emerged from the hall having changed out
of their traditional outﬁts and into golf caps
and plaid dress coats for their ﬁnal dance.

Hands—on demonstrations allowed chil-
dren to take part in the festivities. Darritza
and Katya Zatek showed how to make
kwaity, which are paper ﬂowers, swiaty,
which are paper ornaments, and pierogies.

“Even though the children do not speak
Polish, they can do some of the same things
their forefathers did to help them better
understand their heritage,” festival volun-
teer Florence Kozlowski said “This festival
brings back memories when you can run
into old friends and relatives that have
moved out of the urban area and show them
that the city is still living with Polish cus-
toms.”

Merchants sold crafts and demonstrat-
ed other traditional Polish customs such as
Easter egg decorating. Dolls, wooden
Easter eggs, jewelry and Polish books about
folklore, cuisine and medicine were for sale.

All of the proceeds from the festival go
toward the Polish Room scholarship fund.

Protestors, counter—protcstors
march between Pitt and CMU

Peace, page 1

racy looks like, that [the counter-. '

protest] is what the war machine looks
like,” and an occasional comment from
a speaker.

‘ Speaker response to the counter-
protestors ranged from ridicule to pity.
Local activist Dan Sullivan said protest-
ers shouldn’t be. cold because they had
“ﬂags to wrap themselves in.” The
Thomas Merton Center’s Ken Boas told
the crowd that the counter-protcstors
“are not your enemies” and encouraged
people to “open forums for discussion.”

The peace rally, which began with
an open-mic session from 1 to 4 p.m.,
started with about 30 participants but
quickly grew in number when the march
began at 5 p.m. More than 100 people
remained after the march to hear speak-
ers and performers on the Union patio.

The emcee for the evening was
Mark Egerman, a sophomore at CMU
and member of the Pittsburgh Anti—War
Coalition. ‘

“We are neither with Bush nor the
terrorists,” Egerman said through a bull-
horn at the software institute. “Dropping
bombs to ﬁght terrorism is like burning
books to ﬁght illiteracy.”

One of the speakers at the post-
march session was Brother Nazeeh
Alothmany of the Islamic Center.

“I wonder, really, when we are
going to realize that war will never
bring peace,” Alothmany said.

Also speaking was Luqman-Abdul
Salaam, introduced by Egerlnan simply
as “one cool guy.”

“Remember who George Bush is,”
Salaam directed the audience, calling
attention to everything from the presi-
dent’s jump in approval rating to the
military hi_story of his cabinet members.

“A military coup has happened
before our eyes,” Salaam said to loud
applause. “We’re gonna make this a
Vietnam, y’all. Tum off your goddanm

TVs.” '
One of the musical acts in the rally
was folk singer Anne Feeney, a member
of the Coalition of Labor Union Women
and the Thomas Merton Center, who
performed with slam poet (‘Chris
Chandler. . ‘ '

“People are skeptical of this bullshit
war,” Chandler said. With Feeney’s gui-
tar accompanying him, he referrcd to
the president as “Forrest W. Gump” and
spoke of major corporations as having
“their hands so,-far up the tight rectal
sphincter of George W. Bush that they
operate him as a hand puppet.”

Sullivan sang a remade version of
Harry Belafonte’s “Day-O,” sung as a
war protest song that proclaimed: “Oil!
We want Oil! Bombing run and we blow
up your home.” A

The cold night drove some specta-
tors inside, but many stayed for the
duration of the program. _ V

, “It’s really great to see this turnout,”
said Hana Buelow, freshman co-chair of
the Students in Solidarity Anti—War
Committee. “Especially since we had 11
times as many people as the counter-
protcstors, it shows that, “if we are a
minority, we’re a vocal one.” _‘

Egerman, who atmounced the head
count results onstage, said more simply,
“Welcome to the majority.”

“The support that we’rc receiving

‘from the students and people of

Pittsburgh shows me that people will
listen to our message,” Egerman said
afterward. ‘ 1‘

. The counter-protestors declined. to
respond to the rally, and instead walked
away singing “The Star—Sparlgled
Barmcr.” » V ’

Students in Solidarity said it plans. J

to continue questioning the war through
education programs. 7

“The rallies are really fun and all,”
Buelow said, “but what we’re really

about is getting information out there -

about what’s really going on.”

Kurlander said. “He said they weren’t
realistic —'— that no guy would go to those
lengths to ‘see a girl.”

Though “St. Elmo’s Fire” didn’t win

-him the girl of his dreams, it did win over

audiences and was followed by two more
“brat pack” movies, which Kurlander did
not write. He eventually went to work on
such shows as “Saved by the Bell,”
“Malibu, CA” and “U.S.A. High.”

“I’m arrested at 17,” Kurlander said.
“l’ve. never gotten over the injustices of
high school, that’s why I write about it.”

As someone who writes predomi-
nantly about youth, Kurlander has strong
views on today’s generation.

“I feel there’s a certain cynicism in
this generation today,” he said. “I at least
had a president like Kennedy who you
could look up to, but you guys, sadly,
have never had a president who you

‘could admire. I think your generation

realizes they have to be their own role
models.” I ‘

According to Kurlander, despite the
huge and growing market for teen
movies, he feels there’s still more to
write about.

Producer says he never got over ‘injustices of high school’

“I feel that teens are not portrayed as
dimensionally as they should be,” he
said. “As many teen movies as there are,
I keep thinking there’s still more to be
done, and I’m amazed that people
haven’t done better ones.” i I

Though Kurlander is spending these
days teaching, he would like to start writ-
ing screenplays again.

“I really think your generation
secretly longs to believe in something,”
Kurlander said. “I think on some level
you have been so inundated [with vio-
lence] that you’re numb. There’s been no
real war, no real test, and so that’s what I

would write about.”

Kurlander, who was born and raised
in Pittsburgh, said it’s always been his
fantasy to come back to his hometown to
teach.

“I think you can save a life with a
movie,” he said. “Movies tell stories
about people and the people at Pitt
should start writingmovies and telling
stories about their generation, and I want
to facilitate that.”

“Really, my whole presence here is
to say I can do it, you can do it,”
Kurlander said. “I don’t think the stories
of Pittsburgh have all been told yet.”

A time of remembrance

Upgrade to Soldiers’ and Sailors ’ should be pursued

Today is Veterans Day. Although we

typically observe this occasion on Nov._

11, we celebrate today because Nov. 11
fell on a Sunday this year.

Congress set aside this day in 1926
to honor those who served in World War
I. At the time, it was the worst war in
human history. Our country chose Nov.
11, the anniversary of the armistice in
1918, to remember the war’s horrors. It
became the day to honor all veterans
after World War H and the Korean War.

Even though Pitt does not close for
Veterans Day —— we still have to go to
classes —— this year it is more important
than ever to remember those who have
sacriﬁced. Whether you agree with the
cause of any war, today is the day to
honor the human beings who suffered
hardship and lost their lives because of
war.

One way to do that —— albeit another
day, since it is closed today —-— is to ven-
ture across Fifth Avenue from the
William Pitt Union to Soldiers’ and
Sailors" Memorial.

Built in"-31910 to honor Allegheny
County veterans of the Civil War, its
museum now features exhibits about
America’s wars and a Hall of Valor for
Western Pennsylvanians who received
medals for their valor in combat. It also
hosted a replica of the Vietnam Veterans

Memorial this summer.

Yet few Pitt students have likely _
entered the hall, except for those few
who vote on Election Day. Whether you
go to see the uniforms worn by soldiers
who fought in the past, the photos or _sirn-
ply to satisfy your curiosity, it is worth a

, visit.

And its scope may soon expand.

The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette reported
yesterday that the board of Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ is considering a plan to convert
the building into the National Military
History Museum of the United States.
Although there are several military histo-
ry museums, the national one would be
housed here, right next. to our campus. It
would be affiliated with the Smithsonian
Institution and other military museums
across the country.

While this project will be ambitious
and expensive, it can —— and should —— be
pursued. It will be a great honor for
Pittsburgh and for Western Pennsylvania
to have this museum here.

Pittsburgh is an ideal location, as it
would continue a historic trail that
includes the new National Civil War
Museum in Harrisburg, the forthcoming
Army Heritage Museum in Carlisle and
Gettysburg National Military Park, site
of what some historians call one of the
most important battles in world history.

_ hard to believe that on the

Legacy of Civil War should
remain alive in American memory

Did America need the Civil War?

I grappled with this concept on a
recent class trip to Sharpsburg, Md.
The pristine barrenness of the land
was surprisingly beautiful as waves of
peach-gold wheat washed up to where
I stood on a lonely two-lane road. The
noise generated by my’

nomic and geographical differences
instead of the moral issue.

The Civil War changed this.
Americans will probably never agree
about the causes of the war. As a child
of the South, I’ve found that few

Hey die-hard vegetarians, where’s the beef?

Not having a choice in life can be a
damn good thing, especially when
you’re talking about the food you eat. I
remember in grade school when my
mom would pack me a lunch

do you think of yourself as a true vege-
tarian when you may have eaten a tasty
tuna fish or ham sandwich many years
ago?

’ Most vegetarians, on

consisting of a turkey sand-
wich and a juice box, and I
didn’t have a say in the mat-
ter. _

But that didn’t bother me
at all 4 in fact, I kind of liked
not having a choice. It proba-
bly didn’t bother many of
you either, even all of you
tree-hugging vegetarian hip-
pie bastards out there.

    

Jeremy 

Columnist

some level, are hypocriti-
cal — especially standard
college vegetarians.
Granted, some may be
freakishly hardcore about
it and eat nothing but bean
curd and water. But I’ve
seen some of my vegetari-
an friends ﬂip-ﬂop a few
months on, a few months
off, and still" claim that

Many vegetarians today
are what I call “converts.” They, like me
as a youngster, at one time ate their meat
and liked it. But somewhere down the
crooked, health-infested road of life,
they woke up one day and vapidly said,
“Oh my God! Eating baby cows is
wrong.”

I don’t understand how they sud-
denly made the decision. Maybe they
even did it while feasting upon a tasty
chalupa. Didn’t you at one point, even if
it was a while ago, enjoy the taste of a
bloody, meaty hamburger? So then why

they’re vegetarians.‘ Now
if that’s not a hypocrite, then I don’t
know what is. If you’re born a meat
eater, you will stay one forever, regard-
less of the new-age label you give your-
self.

Unless you have been a vegetarian
from day one — which is a rarity for our
generation — then I suggest you keep it
all to yourself. The fact that you don’t
eat meat is fine with me. You can ruin
your life by whatever means you see
necessary. But the second it invades my
lifestyle is the second you wake the

 

sleeping giant.

Vegetarian activists always try to hit
others with the guilt trip and show pic-
tures of baby lambs and other cute ani-
mals. While I understand their concern,
I still think that there may be a more
constructive way to get me on their side
— trying to make me feel bad for eating
meat does not work. They could try to
sell that whole mad cow disease aspect
of it or how meat is full of dangerous
bacteria. Those are two points that, if
argued well, could actually sway a lot of
meat eaters. But as is, the guilt trip is not
going to cut it for this Big Mac lover.

,Morality is a thing of the past. With
everything that is happening. in the polit-
ical arena today, the moral problem of
eatingbeef is not a major one. I could
not care less about how much Bessie the
cow doesn’t like it that I’m about to take
a sledgeharnrner to her skull and fry up
half of her ass. Despite the fact that you
think it’s wrong, it will never change.
Someone will kill thosejpoor innocent
cows anyhow. So we might as well
enjoy the insides of them that your pre-
cious Mother Nature has offered up to
us.

I hear a lot of fruity leaf eaters talk-

ing about the health benefits er being a
vegetarian. I say to you folks: Go back
to California and don’t forget to take the

' green bean you rode in on with you.

Meat is not all that unhealthy. I’m

_ sure you remember that triangular piece

of sweet propaganda from grade school
known as “the food pyramid.” Well,
meat takes a high spot on that little
puppy, which means that. all of you
cucumber-‘stroking tofu eaters out_ there
are seriously lacking in necessary nutri-
ents. ’ '

I’m not saying that eating vegeta-
bles is wrong. In fact If like them all
myself. While I fully respect your sud-
den choice to eat nothing but iceberg
lettuce and grapes, please keep the
meat-eating guilt trip to yourself. Your
life choice is fine with me, as long as
you can live with the fact that you are
now a hypocritical vegetarian convert
and will forever be shamed by the soul
of Clucky Jim, your poor and dead 1988
Thanksgiving turkey.

Thank you, Residence Life

Many thanks to Justin McClelland for his
impromptu article about the impromptu irnprov
we hosted with the Public Theater and
Residence Life, our partners in bringing ﬂavor-
ful arts to the Residence Halls (“Improv group
takes suggestionspfrom the audience,” Nov. 5).
It is important to recognize all parties involved.
Residence Life has been avidly working with us
over the course of this year to instigate arts out-
ings for ﬂoors as well as bring lunch—hour arts
programs to the Towers lobby, ‘ such as the
Pittsburgh Symphony String Trio performance
this April. Pitt Arts will sponsor 100 programs
this year and some of our most interesting, fun
and imiovative ones will happen right here in
our dorms.

Not just a race issue

We, as the Campus Women’s Organization,
disagree with the way business is being con-
ducted concerning SGB resolution 0010. We
signed on to member Michelle Agostini’s reso-
lution with the intention of building a coalition
to assure representation of all underrepresented
groups in the Pitt community. CWO was not
under the impression that this resolution was for

the advancement of black students only.

Many groups are struggling for equality and
recognition‘ on Pitt’s campus. It is not just a
black and white issue. Propagating the _notion
that one underrepresented group is more disad-
vantaged than another leads to division and sep-
aratism in what -could otherwise be a strong
coalition and support network.

Historically underrepresented groups are
just that — historically underrepresented. It is not

» a euphemism for black, and we find it offensive

to women and other underrepresented people, —
including black students — that anyone would
force such a division of identities. The response
of women workers in the Student Non—Violent
Coordinating Community to Stokely
Carrnichael’s sexist comments that women’s
only position in leadership is prone was to
examine intersections of race and gender in
privilege and underrepresentation. Likewise, we
must take not only race and sex, but gender and
sexual identity, disability and class into consid-
eration when assuring representation of all

groups.

ery as a direct issue. We could no longer look the other
way and pretend that the fighting stemmed from something — .
other than the real human rights issue. After bringingthe ' ‘
subject to the forefront of the war, we had no choice but to’

end slavery.

True freedom did not come quickly. The first hints of ~
equality took nearly a hundred years to emerge, and even.

today, racism refuses to die.

But things continue to improve. I grew up in
Richmond, Va. — the capital of the Confederacy — at a
racially mixed school, in a community where racism was
laughable. I have complete faith that we’re improving with
each generation. V

Some historians argue that the Civil War was unneces-

- sary. They claim that slavery would have faded away as

technology made human labor impractigal. But something
so evil as slavery could be neither expected nor allowed to
simply fade away — it needed tobe ended.

If we’-d never faced the moral issue of slavery, we

could never hope to someday become a truly free nation. V

It’s important for us to remember — and honor —

those who went before us. Noble men fought and died on

both sides, and like everything in history, we have to View
beliefs in the context of their times. If we fail to look at
history with a critical eye, learning from the mistakes of

_ our predecessors, we’ll be doomed to repeat them. ‘

And that would be truly pointless.

Columnist J. Elizabeth Strohm oﬁers her moral support to

all children of Civil War buffs. Trust her; she knowswhat A

it’s like. Reach her at jestrohm@yahoo.com.

to select 196 photographs to display as an estimate of
what he considered the synthesis.

Sam Stephenson, guest curator of “Dream

cinematic streams of images, and that he often com-
pared this kind of visual stream to music; in fact,
Smith thought that Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 14
perfectly complemented his Pittsburgh photographs.

These photographs embrace contrast —— old and
young, religious and secular, black and white, light
and dark. Smith had the idea of “equilibriums of
paradox” and sought to manifest them in his work,
which explains his love of contrasts, which he made

contrasts.

from Western Pennsylvania taken from
1890 to 1930. Each is a reproduction of
cabinet cards whose names and dates have
been lost through the years.

Black and white photographs, some

tinted yellow, line the wall. Aside from the 1

family portraits, the photographs are from
no later than the 19503. From landscapes
to people, each photograph takes you back
in time. There are visions of Point State
Park pre—fountain era and the North Shore
before Three Rivers Stadium graced the
skyline.

You also get a taste of what life was
like in the city when Pittsburgh was appro-
priately called “The Smoky City.” A photo
titled “Checkered Ca ” from around 1945
.shows a group of 20-somethings celebrat-
ing the end of World War 11. They are
packed tightly into a cab like sardines, and
although the photo is black and white, the

‘,soot and dirt on each of their faces and

 is "clearly Visible. If there wasn’t a

Z that these men and women were coal mine

workers going home after a hard day’s

Handing it WEI‘
Both guys and gals like their bags

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
The Pitt News

You remember the saying, “Love to!
Love the bag, lovethe shoes, love every-
thing. Love to!” made famous by Rupert
Everett in “My Best Friend’s Wedding?”

I’m sure I wasn’t the only one who
memorized this -saying. It was the perfect
compliment to give :a good friend every
time she coordinated a trendy outﬁt well
with her most posh purse.

_ Guys, I’m not just talking about those
frilly little sequin and rhinestone bags.
The guys and girls of Pitt have a Variety
of places to contemplate for their latest
shopping excursion. Take for example,
Littles Shoes in Squirrel  . "

According to Sonya Haber, Littles’
accessory buyer, the store’s bestseller is
their custom—made news bags. News
bags, you ask? Basically, they’re bags
with a news article featured from the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette on them. A 12-
year—old,- or hey, a 21-year-old, may be
interested in the ‘N Sync bag with a
newspaper photo from their latest con-
cert. A picture of the implosion of Three
Rivers Stadium, Chinese symbols and
Japanese postcards all grace the sides of
these bags, too.

Not interested in carrying the news?
Then try this out. According to.Haber and
anyone who may be a dedicated fan of
Joan Rivers, here are a few things you
need to know about what’s in and,what.’s _.
so out. Remember those Pop Tartc,orn-

mercials? This will tell you all you need J V l’ 

to know about what’s hot and what’s“ri_ot.
Animal lover? Don’t worry. . 
print is. dying out.  ‘A j.
.  Love “That 70’s show?” Retro bags
are taking over the fashion market.

Men’s plaid is back and in so many 

styles. Take for -example the ibaguette-' 

shaped purse that ﬁts right".over yours-_

shoulder and above your waist. _

Westem-inﬂuenced bags need a lasso
strung around them with the Way they’re‘
selling, making leather and fringe show
up more on ‘stores’ shelves.

Bowling bags aren’t just to take to the
alleys anymore, and every color of cor-
duroy is appearing on men and women’s
shoulders. Check out Avalon on Forbes
Avenue to see their handbags from their
new shipment of Levi’s purses and mes- ,
senger bags.’ ’

Stick to these- tips, never be afraid to
try something new, add your own person-
al touch and you’ll be hip_.,.or at least
your bag will be stylish.

In a church service somewhere, a _»

sweet old lady pumpsaway at a piped
behemoth to produce mighty sounds.
Outside a man with a giant handlebar
mustache cranks a box while a monkey
dressed as a bell-hop dances for
change. If these are what come into
your mind when you think of organ
music, then it’s time to change your

opinion. : .. '  V »

Soulive is just the type of band that
can do that for you. Fresh from opening
for Dave Matthews,Band and touring
in Europe, the band now descends on
Pittsburgh. ~

Their mixture of new and old.
school soul-infused jazz makes abun-
dant use of the fingers of Neil Evans, ‘
the band’s organist, who effectively
creates the funk groove melodies that
this band is known for playing.

Neil Evans’ brother, Alan Evans,
appears with him and supplies smooth
drumbeat rhythms and jams. Eric
Krasno completes the trio with cool
guitar licks and turns "of the frets that

-sound as’ ifahis fingers A effortlessly

dance over the strings. ‘
When these three get together, the
result is anything but stiff. In fact stiff-
ness is just what the band’s members
dislike in their audiences. They encour-
age people to stand up, feel the music
and get into the jive of the notes.
Regardless of whether you come to

see them to get your groove-on or feel i
'that you are more sophisticated and

only want to see their unique new inter-
pretation of the jazz style, you will tap
your feet and bob your head to the
melodies andbeats before the night is
over. '

According to Stephenson, Smith

project. Shortly before taking the
original assignment, the photograph-

' er occupied a prestigious position at ,

of the continual tensions between

always‘ wanted complete editorial

For four years after he left his 00

post at Life, which paid? today’s

0 equivalent of about $125,000 a year,

Smith lived in poverty, working on
what he would consider the final lay-
out of his photographs. He rejected
offers from high-profile magazines
because they would not surrender

full editorial control to him, and
eventually made a deal withthe. V
magazine Photography 'Annual',
which paid him only $1,900 but gave «
him full editorial control. *  '.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS 2

  Knighty-night!
Panthers shut

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

PISCATAWAY, N.J. — The

‘ events that unfolded Saturday after-

noon at Rutgers Stadium resembled
acomedy act rather than a football
game.

The Panthers made apmockery

. ‘of. theScarlet Knights by connect-

pgame, breaking it open early with ~

ing for six first-half touchdowns
and running all over the field en
route’ to- a 42-0 victory.

Pitt dominated all aspects of the

pas-ses to wide open receivers that

the Rutgers defense‘ could not con-'

tain. _

Antonio Bryant and R.J.
English continued to be a tantaliz-
ing tandem at wide receiver, and
Raymond Kirkley provided the
offense on the ground for a Panther
team that played "two completely
different halvesof football.

For the first two quarters, the
Panthers made big plays and put
points on the board, led by "quarter-
back David Priestley who threw for
284 yards and four touchdowns’ as
Pitt amassed 393 total 1 yards.
Bryant, who finished the game with

five catches for 107 yards, was the ..

target for three of those touchdown
passes- ’  ‘

Priestley settled ‘ into a’ groove
early on whenhe hit Kris Wilson
for a 41-yard gain? that set up the
first touchdown by Bryant to give
Pitt a 7-0 lead.

5‘We got a break early with hit-
ting Kris for a big chunk,” Priestley
said. “It helped me calm downand
concentrate on throwing the foot-

» ball.” .

A number of times during the
game, Rutgers defenders became
concerned with covering . Bryant

”'and‘_g'EnIg1ish, leaving Wilson wide
open in’; the‘ middle of the field". It

also left holes" that gave Kirkley
room to run. '
Kirkley in_ the first half _ com-

piled‘-q13_mshes for 83 yards, includ-

Rutgers

ing a 35-yard sprint into the end '

zone for the touchdown.
“I followed the blockers, which

is something I haven’t been doing,”

Kirkley said.

English also added a touchdown’

on five catches for 61 yards before

halftime. Priestley was in on the.

action, moving clown field and div-
ing into the end zone to cap off a
10-yard run that put Pitt up 42-0.
“I am proud of the football
players because this team has gone
through highs and lows,” head
coach Walt Harris said. “And we’re
not sure what team is going to show
up.” '
Priestley finished the day 17 of
25 for 307 yards, moving him into

sixth place all-time on Pitt’s career‘

passing yards list. In just. one game,
Priestley surpassed four players,
including. former teammate John
Turman. V -
The Pitt defense stiﬂed the
Rutgers offense, holding it to just
21 yards for the entire first half.
Freshman quarterback Ryan Cubit
struggled all afternoon, finishing
the game nine of 22- for 56 yards
before being lifted in favor of back-
up _Ted Trump. Cubit was sacked six
times and threw a number of errant
passes that appeared to be intended
for his teammates on thesideline.
“They showed us a wide pack-
age and we didn’t know what to
expect,” said Pitt linebacker and
New Jersey native Gerald Hayes.
“But we are always capable of
going out and stopping a team.”

_ Nick Lotz connected on all six
extra point attempts and also moved
up in the record books. He now sits
fifth on Pitt’s‘ career scoring list
with 186 points, moving» past
George McLaren of the 1915-18
teams. -

Andy Leeqalsohad a solid day
for special teams; averaging 35.7
yards per punt and placing three of
his six inside the 20-yard line.

continue to dominate

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

PISCATAWAY, N.J. .— They play

for the thrill of the game, for the feeling ,.

after a great touchdown‘ catch and for a
victory for their team. But on Saturday
at Rutgers Stadium, Antonio Bryant
and R.J. English played for the record
books.

Bryant and English combined for‘

four of the Panthers’ six first-half
touchdowns. English came into
Saturday’s game as the leader in receiv-
ing yards in the Big East conference.
English added 61 1' yards to his
league-leading total of 592 yards on the
season. His one touchdown came 5
minutes, 21 seconds into’ the first half
on a 21-yard pass from David Priestley.
English ran a _timing pattern on the

- right side of the ﬁeld and Priestley took

a three—second drop back from center
and threw the ball to English while
English’s back was still looking toward
the uprights. When English turned
around, the ball hit him square in the
chest to give to‘Panthers a quick 14-0
lead. 6

But the day belonged to Bryant.
The Biletnikoff Award winner for the
nation’s best wide receiver from a year

ago showed why many people believe»

Bryant has a promising football future.

“I’m really proud of Antonio the
past two weeks,” head coach Walt
Harris said. He showed what a team
player is. He is going to pry "7 a long
time.”

Bryant had ﬁve catches for 107
yards and three touchdowns in what
Harris called Bryant’s best game in_his

THE’ PITT NEWS

Hey Pitt fans, football
seasonisn’t over yet 

Can you believe it? Pitt needs just
two more wins to be eligible for anoth-
er bowl and the excitement seems to be
growing. Maybe the students will catch
the bowl buzz and stick with their team.

‘ It’s truly amazing that the Panthers
have any chance of making

But there is still time to jump back
on the bandwagon. Pitt crushed three
straight opponents, including the
thrashing of No. 12 Virginia Tech, and
now has a record of 4-5. ,
So Pitt needs two more

any ‘type of bowl that does-
n’t have a crusty ring around
it. Remember the embarrass-
ing loss to South Florida? .

How about being
thrashed by Miami on
national television? ‘

Or getting beat by a sub-
par Notre Dame team that

Follow that up by con-
secutive losses to Syracuse

  

Jeremy Jester

wins to become bowl eligi-
ble. These are opportuni-
ties for Pitt students .to
show their support not
only for their team, but
also for their school. -
Even though the
Panthers’ game against
West Virginia is during.
Thanksgiving ' break,
Mountaineer Stadium
should be filled with Pitt

and Boston College, .and Pitt
was 1-5 with its only win coming from
a Division I-AA team.

Admit it, you gave up. You bought _

into the preseason hype and were dis-
gusted by the freeloading players. Of

-course you were, and the horrible stu-

dent attendance the last two home
games proved it.
If this school’s students truly love

their football team, then why isn’t the
northwest comer of Heinz Field filled .

with loud and crazy fans?

Pssst. That’s the student section, if
you didn’t know. - ,

Why does it take Thursday night’
ESPN games for anyone to get excited?

By the way, the Panthers played
Miami that night.

Why weren’t the goal posts torn
down after the upset victory of Virginia
Tech? J

Yes, Pitt actually won that one.

The‘ reason is simple. Fairweather
Pitt fans ‘would rather lambaste Penn
State for a game shown ontelevision
than attend their own schoo1’s games.

Don_’t whine and say it’s because-
you have to drive to games. No one
went to games at Pitt Stadium and that
was right on campus. And if anyone
did, they would leave by halftime to get

off and showing off all of

their “teef.” Just the fact that it is the.
' Backyard Brawl should be enough
motivation to attend the game. Add in‘

the fact that it holds bowl—significance
and it makes the match even more
important. _
' One week later, the students inside
and outside of Heinz Field should.ter-

rorize the Golden Blazer fans and play- '
ers. Remember, it is Pitt’s home field —*

visiting teams should be scared to walk
through the gates. ‘

Most importantly, the game might »
determine whether any Pitt students _
will be traveling to Orlando to watch»-
the Panthers in their second consecutive

bowl game. * .

Like Antonio Bryant said in ‘his’

post- game interview on .WRRK
Saturday, “We need our fans not to turn
their backs on us.” . '

‘ Now is the time for Pitt students to ‘
show their support. With the most sig— _ '
nificant games of the year ahead, Heinz . V

Field needs to be loud and most impor-
tantly, filled with proud students. If the
football team can bounce back, so can
the fans.

a 93-63 victory Saturday night.

BRANDON WALOFF/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

‘ - Sophomore Julius Page puts in two of his 16 points to_ help lead the Panthers to

.J OE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

Memories of last season’s run in the
Big East Tournament still remain in the
minds of many, but the question sur-
rounding the men’s basketball team this
season is whether the young Pitt team can
emulate that success.

The Panthers took a promising step
in that direction by ﬁnishing the exhibi-
tion season Saturday night with a 93-63

‘ win over the EA Sports All-Stars at

Fitzgerald Field House.

Junior Brandin Knight recorded his
second consecutive 21-point game to go
along with eight assists to lead Pitt in
scoring. Julius Page added 16 points

'while Toree Morris and Ontario Lett

scored 15 points each.

‘ Dirk Rassloff and Dominic Ellison

had 10 points each to lead the All-Stars.
Pitt head coach Ben Howland was

excited, not just about getting points from

. his big men, but also about his team’s

improved rebounding. Chad Johnson led
Pitt with 12 rebounds as the Panthers out-
rebounded the All-Stars, 40-27.

“Toree and O[ntario] both played
weH,” Howland said. “I was real pleased
with Chad Johnson’s performance. Our
big concern is rebounding and I told the
guys if you want to play a lot you have to
get a lot of rebounds.” .

 Men’s basketball finishes preseason with win

The Panthers’ defense kept the All-
Stars in check through the entire game,
holding them to just 37 percent shooting
from the ﬁeld.

While he thought the team did a bet-
ter job defensively, Howland felt they
needed to do a better job defending the
ball.

“We have to do a better job not get-
ting beat on drives,” he said. “We had too
many times where they were beating us

-off the dribble and we had to rotate too

muc .”

Pitt got off to a slow start, falling
behind 4-0 before Knight’s three-point
ﬁeld goal two minutes into the game.

Knight’s basket started the Panthers
on an 18-2 run, highlighted by a two-
handed dunk by Morris and a layup by
Lett.

“It’s nice to have that one-two
punch,” said Howland about Moms and
Lett. “I thought Toree played excellent at
the beginning of the game. Then Ontario
comes in and works har .”

The All-Starts countered with a 21-
11 run, cutting the _Panthers’ lead to 29-27
with 4:44 left in the first half. Pitt
responded by scoring the next 11 points,
ﬁnishing the half with a 42-30 lead.

The Panthers continued their run into
the second half, putting the game away

Bryant moves up in Pitt, Big East record books  

Bryant, page 15

Pitt career. With each catch and yard he
gained, Bryant moved up in the record
books, not only in Pitt history, but in
Big East history as well.

“A.B. really stepped up his
demeanor on the sidelines and in the
game,” Harris said. This was his best
game since he’s been here.”

~ With Bryant’s ﬁve catches, he now
has 154 career receptions in a Pitt uni-
form including postseason -play. He is
now just seven receptions behind
Dietrich Jells (1991-95) for second
place all-time in Pitt history.

On the second play of the second
quarter, Priestley hooked up with

Bryant for a 45-yard reception to give’

Bryant the second greatest number of
receiving yards by a Panther in Pitt his-
tory. Bryant passed his mentor Latef
Grim (1998-2000), who had 2,680
receiving yards as a Pitt player.

“They put eight guys up in the
box,” Bryant said. “Me and Dave’s
[Priestley] eyes lit up.”

Bryant wasn’t done moving up in
the record books just yet. In Big East
conference’ record books, postseason
play isn’t counted. Therefore, Bryant’s
stats from last year’s Insight.com Bowl

aren’t counted toward Big East records.

Before Saturday’s game, Bryant .

needed two receptions to move into
eighth place all-time in Big East career
receptions. Three minutes into the sec-
ond quarter, on Bryant’s second touch-
down catch of the game and third catch
overall, Bryant passed former West
Virginia Mountaineer Shawn Foreman
(1995-98) and moved into eighth place
in career receptions in the Big East.
After Bryant’s ﬁve-catch perfor-
mance Saturday, he now has 149 recep-
tions and stands only three receptions
away from West Virginia’s Khori Ivy
(1997-2000) and seventh place all-time

in the conference.

Earlier in the game, on Bryant’s
first catch, he had moved, into fifth
place on the all-time Big East receiving’
yardage list, passing Miamj’s Reggie
Wayne. But moving up one spot on that
list wasn’t enough for Bryant 0
Saturday. '

When the second half“ began,
Bryant had already passed Miami’s

’ Santana Moss (1997-2000) for fourth

place on the all-time yardage list and

was only 7 yards away from third place,

held by former-teammate Grim. ‘
By that point in the game, the

Panthers were ahead 42-0 and Harris. j

had begun putting in his second string
players on offense. Yet on Pitt’s second
play on offense in the second half,
Priestley found a wide-open Bryant for
a 12-yard gain. j '
Immediately after the reception,
Harris took Bryant out of the game
because he now had 2,551 receiving -
yards in his career and had passed Grim

for third all-time in the Big East. Bryant V ,

now sits only 116 yards away from

'Syr,acuse’s Marvin Harrison (1992-95)

who is second place on that list.

Bryant has one year of eligibility
after this season. If he plays next sea-
son, he might just do some more dam-
age in both Pitt’s and the Big East’s
receiving record books. The question
still looms large though: rWi1l he stay or
go pro? , V r ‘

“I’l1 allow the Lord to answer that
for me,” Bryant said. “I’m on a four-
year scholarship and that’s what I’m'
going to play.” '

Knight puts up

second time 

Basketball, page 17

with a 30-9 run, extending their lead to
20 points, 59-39, with 14:01 left in the
game. . . '
' “Today we improved a little bit on
defense,” Knight said. '
Pitt opens its regular season on
Friday against Morgan State, starting a

nine-day stretch that Howland has '

labeled a death march. The Panthers will
play six games during that stretch,
the ‘Robert Morris
Thanksgiving Classic. _ '

‘‘We’ll find out a lot about ourselves
in the next couple weeks and figure out -
what we have to do better,” Howland
said. ‘‘That’s why we’re playing those
extra games. We have a young team and
we want to get a lot of experience.”

Panthers must now prepare for Backyard Brawl

Victory, page 15

The second half saw a Pitt team
that for the majority put second and
third stringers on the field. Harris
replaced Priestley with backup Rod
Rutherford, and third—string quar-
terback Pat Hoderny saw time.

The offense under Rutherford’s
leadership did very little.

Rutherford had nine rushes for just
20 yards and completed one of two
passes, a 16-yard pass to Roosevelt
Bynes. Hoderny finished one of two
for 7 yards.

The

Scarlet Knights strung

     

together a few plays to pick up
yards and an occasional first down,

but were never really any threat. ‘

Running back Ravon Anderson led
Rutgers with 10 rushes for 40 yards,
and L.J. Smith added five recep~
tions for 25 yards.

“We dominated the run game on
defense and the result says all,”
Harris said.

Mike Barr was forced to punt 10
times for the Scarlet Knights but
averaged 45.8 yards per kick with a
long of 63.

This team that crushed Rutgers

This Week’

after defeating No. 12 Virginia‘Tech

last week hardly resembles the Pitt
squad that started the season 1-5;

“We’ve turned the corner and
learned from our mistakes,” Harris
said. “I’m real proud because it’s
easy
falling short of our expectations and
dealing with the negativity we pro-
ducef’ ‘

One noticeable difference
between the last few games "and
those earlier in the year is the num-
ber of turnovers by the Panthers.
Pitt let games slip away by fum-
bling or throwing and interception
at a critical moment.

5 Slucélenl Orgclnizuiion Meeiings and Eveanis  

to get overwhelmed with

 

The loss drops Rutgers to 2-7
overall and 0-6 in the conference.
But for the Panthers, it was an
invigorating win that moved them
to 4-5 and 3-3 in the Big East and
keeps postseason hopes alive. The
Panthers will next meet West
Virginia in the Backyard Brawl, a
game that some believe could be the
one roadblock on Pitt’s trip “to a
bowl game. _

“Our hopes are high and we’re
finally playing as one,” Kirkley
said. “We have high expectations,
but we’re just taking it one game at
a time.” '
