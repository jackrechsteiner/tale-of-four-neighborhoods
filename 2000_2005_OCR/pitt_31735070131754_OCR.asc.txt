No Dice group won’,ttake a gamble on slot machines

MIKE MASLANIK
Staff Writer

The state legislature has been
mulling over whether to legalize slot
machines at racetracks, in hopes of
bringing Pennsylvania some much-
needed revenue. Meanwhile, a grass-
roots movement concerned about
moral decay is working to put an end
to the discussion.

On a May 27 gathering at the
South Side’s First Presbyterian
Church, members of No Dice, a lob-
bying group opposed to any form of
legalized gambling, laid out its case
with the help of Tom Grey, a former
Methodist preacher and the head of
the National Coalition Against
Legalized Gambling.

“I know what a casino is,” Grey
said to a group of about fifty activists.
“It is a business designed to separate
people from their money.”

Grey said that in a metropolitan
area of 1 million people, 40,000 will
become addicted to gambling.
Taxpayers, he argued, will then
shoulder the burden of paying forvthe
vices of gambling, such as bankrupt-

cy, crime and expenses accrued by.

gambling addicts.
“The point is, for every $1 you
bring in, you spend $1.90 on crime

and addi°cti.on,” he said. . S _  

Grey took the stance t1_1at:l_ega1-
ized gambling “builds our future on
the losses- of others.” A I

“If that works,” he challenged,
“show met.” 

Grey expressed confidence in the
citizens to oppose the bill, saying “I
always bet on the people.” He then
encouraged those in attendance to
“light a fire under their legislators”
by calling, mailing and e—mailing
them. He also encouraged them to
vote against the proposal and to tell
others to do the same. No Dice has a

‘successful track record of opposing a

gambling measures, effectively
staving off an attempt to build a river-
boat casino in the South Side in 1995.

“Lots of people look at this and
say ‘this won’t affect me,”’ Evan
Stoddard, co—founder and president of
No Dice, said. “Ladies and gentle-

men, it will affect all of us.”

Stoddard opposes the measure
because, he said, “it preys on the least
advantaged of our society.” V

Many of those opposed to legal-
ized gambling fear that people who
could least afford to risk their entire
paychecks would be the ones most
tempted to do just that.

Though not in attendance at the
meeting, State Rep. Tim Solobay (D-

48th District, Central Washington
County) broke down the bill, drawn

up by State Sen. Robert M.
Tomlinson (R-6th District, Bucks
County).

“Basically, what we’re hearing is
that 92 cents on the dollar goes back
to the player; 8 cents will be the pot
of money that gets split’ up. Thirty-
five percent of that will go to the
state, 49 percent will go to the track
owners, which leaves 16 percent for
the breeders,” he said.

Out of that 35 percent, Solobay
explained, money will be funneled
into the host municipality, the host
school district and the host county.

“The 35 percent that the state’s
going to get back is estimated at any-
where from $350 million to $750 mil-
lion, depending on the on the number
of machines at each track and how
many locations have permits,” he
said.

The revenue generated by slot
machines will go toward goals like
educational funding and lowering the
property tax '

“You have to look at the benefit
side of things,” Solobay said, defend-
ing the bill.

After the steel mills and factories
closed, he said, Pennsylvania’s econ-
omy shifted from manufacturing and

industry toward service and agricul-
ture. Bringing slots to racetracks, he
argued, will bolster that service econ-
omy for two reasons.

First, slots draw Pennsylvanians,
and around $8 billion a year, across
state lines. Pennsylvanians are, in
effect, paying for West Virginia’s and
New Jersey’s schools and road
repairs.

Second,» racetracks will need to
expand in order to accommodate slot
venues. To do that, the racetracks will
need to hire construction companies
to do the work, which, in turn, would
create job opportunities.

Washington County, home of the
Meadows Racetrack, could benefit
from this employment windfall.

“There are 1,000 families that are
affected, in one way or another, by
whether the Meadows Racetrack
stays open,”,'Solobay said.

Slots would attract people to the
area, causing development to accom-
modate the inﬂux of visitors, Solobay
added.

Pennsylvanians favor the bill by a
margin of three to one, according to
Solobay. Both chambers also general-
1y approve of the measure, he said.
He remains confident that, unless‘ the
state’s portion is not “watered down,”
Governor Rendell will sign it.

Rainy AIDS Walk attracts 1,000
with poetry, music and a drag
queen, falls short of $200,000 goal

ERIC SAPORITO
Staff Writer

The 2003 AIDS Walk partici-
pants braved the rain and mud of
Flagstaff Hill as theirlwelcome to
the AIDS Walk and Community Day

on Saturday, but they still fell about ‘

$100,000 short of their $200,000
goal. '

The Pittsbu_rgh AIDS Task Force
celebrated its ninth
annual VAIDS Walk
and first annual
Community Day with
red balloons

ture AIDS ribbon ——~
ﬂoating between
white canopies and
the" Flagstaff Hill
stage.

Jan Beatty, a Pitt
poetry instructor, read
her poem “Ravenous
Blue” to honor her
friend Scott Blathier,
who died from an AIDS-related ill-
ness. “Ravenous Blue,” a sad but
humorous tribute to Blathier,
described Beatty’s misfortune with
a hair dye named Ravenous Blue

I that Blaither applied to her hair.

Beatty’s first collection of poet-
ry, “Mad River,” published in 1995,
won the Agnes Lynch Starrett Prize
from the University of Pittsburgh
Press. Her chapbook, a small book
of poems titled “Ravenous,” won
the 1995’ State Street Chapbook
Prize.

The AIDS Walk
is the signature
fundraising
event to support

the services ,
oﬂered by PATF

Miss Eda Bagel, a se1f-pro-
claimed world-famous drag queen,
was mistress of ceremonies. With a
quick wit and super—fast costume
changes, she entertained the volun-
teers between.the 20 different per-
formers’ acts.

The PATF introduced the first
annual “Living” AIDS ribbon on
Flagstaff Hill, to remember the lives

lost to AIDS and to honor those liv—_

ing with the disease
today. A moment of
silence followed the
living AIDS ribbon
ceremony as a
memorial to AIDS
victims who have
died.

Red balloons
dotted the gray sky
over Panther Hollow
as KDKA' television
personality Lynn

climbed to the stage
to lead the walkers
in an aerobic stretching exercise
before the five—mile trek through

Pittsburgh Penguins mascot,
Iceburgh, led the one—mile family
walk through Schenley Park.

“Inspirational” Pitt archivist dies at 53

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

A theater buff at Pitt might eas-
ily get excited about The Ford E.
and Harriet R. Curtis Theater
Collection, a special collection in
Pitt’s Hillman Library that contains
several thousand volumes of
playscripts and theater works, more
than 500,000 theater programs and
20,000 photographs. _

A researcher interested in the
collection would also have been
excited about working with Carol
Hoffman, the associate curator of
the collection, " according to those
who knew her. —

graduate student in Pitt’s Master of

Library and Information Science.

Program, who was referred to
Hoffman last winter by Pitt profes-
sors. “She was always positive and
very willing to help and share with
others her extraordinary knowledge
about the Curtis Collection.”

Hoffman, who was 53 when she
died on Wednesday, June 4, of
health problems, was a widow who
is survived by two sons and a
daughter.

No members of her family could
be reached, and her former employ-
ers did not comment.

“She was an excellent example
of a professional archivist,” Walton
said. “She will be truly missed.”

Xiaomei J ia released from
Chinese prison on June 3

Falun,page1
Jin said.
The conference asked for

American support of Li and other
practitioners. Jin urged Americans to

write their legislators to request Li’s

release. .

June 3 marked a victory for
Falun Gong supporters when practi-
tioner Xiaomei Jia was released
from a labor camp, where she was
imprisoned since November 2001. In
March, Xiaome'i’s husband, Cailu
Xu, spoke at Carnegie Mellon
University with Amnesty
International in hopes of gaining
American support. As a result,
Congressman Mike Doyle and
Pittsburgh City Councilman William
Peduto were particularly active in
aiding Xia0.me,i’s release and getting
her a visa and passport.

Cailu demonstrated with the
other practitioners at the June 4 con-
ference. Wearing a shirt stating,
“Falun Gong is good,” Jin spoke of
his wife’s plans to come to America.

The Chinese government has
considered Falun Gong a crime since
1999, by order of Jiang.

“We used to go out and practice
in parks,” Jin said, “but now we
must do it in hiding.” -

Jin commented that she did not
know the current number of practi-
tioners in China, but that, before the
persecution, the government esti-
mated they numbered between 70
and 100 million. The government
felt threatened, she said, because
therewere more Falun Gong practi-
tioners than members of the
Communist party when Jiang’s order
came.

Indicating what would happen if
a, demonstration like Wednesday’s
occurred in China, Jin showed pho-
tos of a 1997 Tinamen Square arrest,
in which police used fire extinguish-
ers on the demonstrators and threw
unidentifiable objects that, Jin said,
“you can clearly see are hitting the
people.” ,

Jin also; said the practitioners
arrested that day have never been
seen again. Those arrested since the
order, she said, are often detained in
prisons and labor camps, where they
have little or no Contact with family
members. ‘

According to the Falun Gong
database, Falun Gong is relatedto
traditional Chinese practices of

exercise and meditation and has
been in’ practice for thousands of

years. It is now practiced in over 50

I countries.

cent cost increase. '
The sit-down protest occurred
on Centre Avenue after the group of
workers marched to the offices of
UPMC Health Plan to deliver a let-
ter. The letter, Hoffman said, corr-
tained thousands of signatures and
"represented the employees demand’
for affordable family health care.
When the workers ‘ were not
allowed to deliver the letter, they
sat in the intersection of Centre
Avenue and Washington Place.

Because of this, police arrested 17‘

of them, and they were released the
following morning at 4:001 a.m.

In a Monday morning prelimi-
nary hearing, “The Health Care 17,”
as Hoffman referredto them, pled
guilty to a single summary offense
of blocking a road. The workers
were originally charged with two
misdemeanors: obstruction of a
roadway and failure to disperse.

Students contiibute to the $2.52 million
price tag through a required $75 transporta-
tion fee each semester.

The cost of last year’s contract will
undoubtedly increase. The question is
whether the university will absorb the high-
er cost of doing business with PAT, or if
higher transportation fees will be passed
along to students. I

“We expect Pitt to pay more,” McNeil
said. “Our contract is with the university.

‘ . Whether or not the increase is passed along

to the students is up to Pitt”

Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs
Robert Hill said the student transportation
fee will not increase next year. V

The prospect of higher fees and less ser-
vice for Pitt students launched Student
Government Board members Stephanie
Hadgkiss and Todd Brandon Morris into
action. They read a statement at the Port
Autho1ity’s public hearing on May 21st.

“Many students [who use public trans-
portation] have classes until the late evening;
from there, many ‘go to the library, which is

open until 2 am,” Hadgkiss said in her.-

statement “Other students — in an attempt
to prevent themselves from being priced out
of an education — work nights and week-
ends. We are pleading to you not to deny us

Lawsuit about more than feeling jilted

On Friday, June 6, Pitt and four other
Big East universities ﬁled suit against
Boston College and Miami as “a last resort
to protect sports programs placed in pro-
found jeopardy” by the rogue colleges’ con-
duct. The rationale: they promised they’d
stay in the Big East, and now they might
move to the Atlantic Coast Conference.

At ﬁrst, this might seem like a juvenile
argument among grade—schoolers. Can we
sue Ben Howland for leavingwhen he said
he wouldn’t? Steve Pederson? Where does
this chain stop? _

This is about more than just Pitt, et al.
feeling jilted, though. It’s about the same rea-
son Miami and BC are leaving: money.

The Big East is on the verge of being a
powerful conference. With the men’s,
women’s and NIT champions, it’s arguably
the best basketball conference in the nation.
Add that to perennial championship con-
tender Miami and three of the fastest-rising
football programs (Pitt, WVU and Tech),
and the Big East is hardly a laughing stock

And the process wasn’t cheap.

If Pitt thought that it was going to spend
its future in Conference USA, it wouldn’t
have dropped $100 million on the Petersen
Events Center, or signed a long-term lease
with Heinz ﬁeld. If UConn didn’t have a
conference to join this year, it wouldn’t have
invested $90 million in a new football stadi-
Lun. They thought they were building for
years to come.

Perhaps most disturbing, however, is

not Miarni’s willingness to forsake the Big

East’s charge to excellence and all the effort
of the last decade, but the fact that Boston
College has been invited to go with them
VV1th all due respect to Boston College, their
NIl.‘—1evel basketball program and mediocre
football team add nothing to the ACC, mak-
ing dubious to the conference’s claim that it

only seeks to raise its standards.

No, Boston College can offer one thing
to the ACC: market People will tt1ne in and
watch BC, no matter how bad ﬂie team is.
The city is big,’ the alumni are devoted:
there’s money to be made. Forget the fact
that the ACC’s northernrnost team is
Maryland or that both Pitt and UConn are

, better in both major sports; there are TV con-

tracts to be signed.

If Miami and Boston College leave, it
could signal more than the end of the Big
East. Itcould be a harbinger of an age where
everything that used to matter in conference
formation no longer does. loyalty and pres-
tige — the reasons Howland and Pederson
left — are irrelevant, as are geography and
the quality of athletics. Only one thing mat-
ters and that’s money. Speciﬁcally, how
much TV stations are willing to pay for cov-
erage of individual teams.

Isitreallysohardtoirnagineaday
when the major conferences’ names are
changed to reﬂect the dominating inﬂuences
of the times? Ten years down the road, the
names ACC, Big 12 and PAC-10 may be
distant memories, and then colleges can
backstab each other for the right to play in
conferences ABC, NBC and CBS.

" assume has to happen event11—

Staring down the barrel of liver spots

The inevitable is ﬁnally happening. I am
getting old. \\

All right, so I shouldn’t complain about
being 22.Ican stillrun arnileinlessthan 10
minutes, and not all of my joints crack when
I get out of bed. And my beer belly isn’t that
big —— I can still kind. of bend
over and touch my toes.

But old age has already
started to set in. The hair on top
of my head is ﬂiinning, which I

ally, since just about every ‘
other male in my family over
30 is close to bald I hardly ever
get carded at the bar anymore,
and when I do, it’s usually by
someone still waiting for his
voice to change. .

But while all of these are good exam-
ples of how close I am to getting liver spots,
here are two reasons that are even better
examples.

Reason #1: Unlike many baseball fans my
age, I love a good pitching duel. I would
much rather watch a 1-0 or a 2-1 game in
which both pitchers dominate.
’ However, that doesn’t mean I don’t like
the long ball. Home runsare just as exciting
as a stlikeout, and when one of those up-and-
coming sluggers smacks the snot out of a
hanging curve, I enjoy it.

, Funny thing about those new guys,
though — they’re new. j

For example: on May 20, I sat down to
watch another stellar episode of

SportsCenter. The ﬁrst highlight that came .

on showed. Cincinnati taking on Atlanta
That night, the Reds’ Austin Keams drove in

, four runs in a 9-8 Cincinnati victory. But

what made the feat special was that it also
happened to be Keams’ birthday.

c How nice, I thought, that the guy got to
have a great game on his 23rd birthday. I
hope that when I’m 23, I can do something
like — then it hit me: I’m going to be .23 in
less than a year,and tlrere’s no way I’ll be

hitting a baseball in the Great American
Ballpark any time soon.

There are 39 major league ball players
who are under the age of 23. That’s not
unusual because there has never been any
kind of rule saying that you have to bea cer-
tain age to play in the big"
:1eagues.What’s hard to grasp is

in 1980 or later.
A ‘ When did this happen? It

guys who were born in 1972

Now those guys are mostly on
the downside of theirvcareers,
and you don’t see them play.
But guys like Kearns,
who. are on SportsCenter
almost daily, I can see just ﬁne — which
leads me to my second reason. ,
Reason #2: While in between articles in this .
month’s Playboy, my eyes — which have
not yet been affected by age — happened to

wander over to this thing that people call the ’

centerfold The girl adorning the pages was
quite beautiful but the problem I found? did-
n’t occur until the last page. . .
Could it really be that she was born in
May of 1981? Justthree weeks aftermyself?

That’s not possible. The girls in these maga- »

Zines always used to seem unattainable
because of their age —’ I just read the articles
then, too, Mom, I swear —— along with the
fact that I would never be able to utter a sin-
gle syllable in their presence.

With a little hard — (cough) not like
that —— research, I soon found out that there
have been 19 Playmates who were born after
1980. So does that mean that now that these_
girls are younger, I’d have a chance and
maybe be able to talk to them?

I doubt it; I’m just a crazy old man.

Joe Marchilena is the sports ‘editor for The

Pitt News and wants to know why those

damn kids have to listen to music so loud.

Canadian legislation stems from seeds of decriminalization

Warning: This is yet another marijuana
legalization column, written by yet another
college student. If you ﬁnd yourself rolling
your eyes or laughing snidely at this point,
keep in mind that we’ll stop writing them as
soon as you start reading them.

Canada’s decision to decriminalize mar-
ijuana has done North American a favor. It
has everyone talking about what they aren’t
supposed to be, which is usually the healtl1i—
est thing for all involved.

All of a sudden, parents, schoolteachers
and students are in a tizzy about what hap-
pens when people start experimenting with
drugs. It’s almost like what would happen if
someone legalized sex before marriage.

Of course, we’re not supposed to talk
about drugs, teen pregnancy or sexual orien-
tation, because none of these things really
exist. Even if they did, they’re taboo and Mr.
Yuck sticker-worthy.

And if someone has spotted you reading
this column, they’ ve probably already given
you the eye. At the risk of getting a ﬁnger
shaken in my face, I say, sometimes, only
through controversial conversations can
rational thought bubble to the surface.

One of the more ludicrous things in this
country is the acceptance of alcohol and
tobacco use, two drugs proven to be

extremely addictive and destructive, while
marijuana, adrug that is not harmless but still
tame compared to its legal counterparts, is
barmed.

While thebattle for the legalization of
marijuana has raged for years, it
is constantly put down by con-
gressmen who proudly wear
their “just say no” pins to ﬂoor of
the House. Dozens of political
ﬁgures, including Al Gore, have
admitted to smokin’ up in col-
lege. ,

Still, these ﬁgures do not
actively seek pro-pot legislation
because it is career suicide. Our-

not be further from the truth. Flag buming’s
legality has been staunchly defended but, at
the same time, it would be anything but cor-
rect to state that the U.S. it. Freedom comes
at a cost and part of that cost is accepting
things that you don’t like.
For instance, I don’t like
KKK rallies, but Iunderstand
why they are allowed to exist.
To object to the use of drugs
is a personal and moral deci-
sion and morality, so much
akin to religion, must be kept
I a ten-foot pole’s length away
from legislation.
Could you imagine the

govemment’s “war on drugs” is
just like the “war on terrorism” or
the “war on ‘80s music.” It is impossible to
ﬁght the faceless. Even if you did put a face
on pot, it would be the face of countless
Americans who once spent a night in a
smoky basement and were passed a pipe.
There are not enough jail cells to hold them
all. V

Even those who are indifferent to drug
use have issues with legalization.
Comparing the situation to prostitution,
some people believe that national legaliza-
tion means national endorsement. This could

social uproar that would be

caused by the crirninalization‘

of adultery? If police oﬂicers arrested every
cheating husband or wife, then the govern-
ment would become a parental ﬁgure. While
morality is a ﬁne form of personal gover-
nance, it simply cannot work on a state level.
Abortion is .a practice often condemned as
immoral, but it remains legal because the
Supreme Court considers it a personal deci-
sion. How is pot any diiferent?

An often-ignored beneﬁt of drug legal-
ization deals with treatment for those cur-
rently abusing’ drugs. Ir1America, drug users

are  Many are afraid to seek med-
ical help for fear of incarceration. Stories
arise every year of a party gone out of con-
trol where somebody clearly overdoses, only
to have other fearful partiers leave them in
their deadly state because they could not take
them to a hospital while under the inﬂuence.

In Europe, a drug addict seeking help at
a rehabilitation center isn’t viewed as a law-
breaker, but as a patient Countries with sen-

sible drug policies also distribute free, clean a

- paraphernalia to users to prevent the spread
of disease. I forget, why are these bad ideas?
Oh yeah, because drugs are bad and drug-
takers are worse. If only everyone could just
be an alcoholic. ’

At the very least, Canada’s ballsy move ‘

should force America to take a long, hard
look at why teenage pot dealers are serving
longer jail terms than rapists. It would also

' force Grateful Dead fans everywhere to ask

themselves this question: is pot still fun if
nobody’s telling you not to take a drag?
Don’t hold your — let’s just say maybe,
someday, we’ll all know the answer.

David J would like to urge all member of the
Canadian Parliament to pass the feedback

Just don’t mess up the rotation

Unshakeable faith in the Cubs questioned in light

My heart bleeds Chicago Cub red
and blue. It bleeds red and blue before it
bleeds “da Bears” navy and orange,
Panther blue and gold or Penguins
black and gold.

The Chicago Cubs were my first ,
love; my first memory is of sitting on
my grandparent’s couch, watching the
Cubs and Harry Caray singing during
the seventh inning stretch. In third
grade, I got into a heated argument with
my music teacher because I didn’t
understand why the words to “Take Me
Out to the Ballgame” read “root, root,
root for the home team,” and not “root,
root, root for the Cubbies.”

To me, that was the only way to
sing the song, and it still is. ’

But the song just became a lot sad-
der, something I thought was impossi-
ble. After all, this October will mark 95
years since the Cubs last won World
Series and 58 years since they last
appeared there.

Since I was born in 1981, the Cubs
have made the playoffs’ a paltry three
times, winning the division only twice.
The Cubs haven’t even enjoyed back-
to-back winning seasons in my lifetime;
1972 was the last time they won more
than they lost for a two consecutive
years.

Compounding all of this is the fact
that my dad is a loyal St. Louis
Cardinals fan. Not a conversation about
baseball goes by when I’m not remind-

ed of the Cubs’ futility. My response

" has been to insist that it can’t get worse

—-'— and then it did.

On the night of June 3, umpires
found cork in the bat of Cubs slugger.
Sammy Sosa and ejected him from the
game. I was listening to the Chicago
broadcast of the-game at home on my
laptop. Upon hearing what happened, I
closed the broadcast win— ‘
dow in a mixture of profani-
ty, disbelief and confusion.
My heart broke every time
Sosa’s bat broke on the
replay. .

It wasn’t just that I saw
our current ﬁrst—place stand-
ing and playoff hopes evap-
orate before my eyes.
Another year of mediocrity
would be nothing new. I saw
something much worse: the
credibility of our star, my favorite play-
er, the Chicago Cubs uniform and base-
ball, hollowed like Sosa’s corked bat.

So here I am, betrayed. I’m sup-
posed to be one of the most loyal fans in
baseball, and now‘ I’m confronted with
the question of whether tovremain loyal
to Sosa, to believe that taking that bat to
the plate was an accident. Sosa insists
that he uses a corked bat in batting prac-
tice just so he can" put on a show for the
fans. Taking his bat to the plate was an
honest mistake, he said. I’m skeptical.

First, why use a bat made lighter by

  

, Jason Lawrence
For The Pitt News

corking it in batting practice, when
you’re seeing lob-balls? Simple physics
tells you that using a heavier bat is
going to cause you to hit the ball fur-
ther, especially when you can take a
huge swing against slow pitches. The
only logical advantage to a lighter,

corked bat would be to catch up to 90- ‘

plus mph fastballs, something Sosa had
yet to do after coming off

the disabled list.

Second, if the bat is
significantly lighter,
shouldn’t Sosa have

noticed? I’m suspicious
that someone who suppos-
edly swings two different
bats, one in batting practice
and one in games, couldn’t
tell the difference when
holding the different bat.
In support of Sosa,_his
76 other bats, as well as his bats on dis-
play in the Hall of Fame, were exam-
ined and had no cork in them. The bat
with which he hit his 498th homerun,

here at PNC Park, was sawed open and .

proved to be solid all the way through.
Unfortunately for Sosa, we can’t
look at every bat that he used on every
.homerun. It’s impossible to prove a
negative, and that’s exactly what prov-
ing that every one of Sosa’s homeruns
are legit would entail. The doubt that
Sosa has now raised can never be coin-
pletely refuted. ’

of Sosa debacle

Now I’m left with the difficult

question of how I should feel about ’

Sosa. Part of me says we’re human and
we make mistakes. We don’t always
think our actions, or their consequences

‘ through. I know I’m guilty of it — we

all are. ,

Even if Sosa’s excuse was wholly
believable, I wish I could be that for-
giving. The bottom line is that there are
lines that, when crossed, damage credi-
bility irrevocably. Sosa crossed that
line.

Fortunately for Sosa, everything
suggests that his credibility, though
unable to be fully restored, can be
rebuilt. When he comes back from his

‘suspension, I’ll welcome him back. to.

the lineup. I believe that he__can help us

win, that he’s~still an important part of I

the team. But will he still be my favorite
Cub? No. When I buy my Cubs jersey
this summer, it won’t have 21 on. the
back, but 22 — phenom pitcher Mark
Prior’s number.

Though my loyalty to Sosa is shak- -

en, my loyalty to the Cubs is not. My
heart still bleeds red ‘and blue. Right
now, it’s bleeding profusely.

Jason Lawrence’s greatest dream is to
be in Wrigley Field to witness the Cubs
w-inning the Series. He believes it will
happen in his lifetime, Tell him if he’s

“I love the smell of napalm in the morning.” - Lt. Col. Kilgore, “Apocalypse Now”

PAGE 10

Good morning, Vietnam

Good night Saigon

Miss Saigon

Through June 22

Starring Brian Noonan, Ma-Anne
Dionisio, Kevin Gray

Directed by Barry Ivan

Civic Light Opera

(412) 456-6666

7L‘r7$hi‘r 1/2

PATRICIA MCNEILL '
Staff Writer

A fiery sun consumes a dark,‘

smoky stage as the curtain rises on the
Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera’s “Miss
Saigon.” Blending a powerful love
story with the horror and aftermath of
the Vietnam war, director and choreog-
rapher Barry Ivan creates a musical
that is intensely emotional and painful-
ly true to life.

Set in April 1975, shortly before
the fall of Saigon, we are introduced to
a world of uncertainty and desperation

with an energetic, raunchy opening

number, “The Heat is on in Saigon.”

In a bar called Dreamland, headed
up by the Engineer (Kevin Gray) who
longs for the “American
Dream,” they are about
to crown a “Miss
Saigon.” Among the
competitors is a new
addition to the regular
prostitutes, a young,
timid girl named Kim
(Ma-Anne Dionisio).

As the Engineer
pushes her — his “fresh
meat” — he is really
after a visa to America,
just as most of the girls
are hoping a G.I. will be
their ticket out of
Saigon.

While Kim loses
the contest, she finds
herself bought by a soldier named John
(Alan H. Green) for his friend Chris
(Brian Noonan). Chris and Kim spend
the night together. Falling in love, they
vow to be with each other and to dance
like it’s “The Last Night of the World.”
But their happiness is cut short when
Chris is ordered to move out and the
two are separat-
ed. -
Three years
pass and Chris
has married an
A m e r i c a n
woman named
Ellen, believing
Kim is lost to
h i 9 m
M e a n w h i l e ,
Kim has
endured “The
Morning of the
D r ag 0 n , ”
Saigon’s fall to
Ho Chi Minh.
She lives on the
love she has for
Chris and the
son she bore
him, hoping
they will one
day be together.
What follows is
a story of pain,
courage and a
mother’s love,
as Kim finds
herself in a posi-
tion many
Vi e tn a In e s e
women faced

after the war. —
“Miss Saigon” explodes with an
intensity that stems from the human
struggle to
survive, suc-
ceed and ﬁnd
love, thanks in
great part to
the tremen—‘
dous cast the
Civic Light
Opera ‘ put
together.
Dionisio is a
- strong actress
who brings to
life the suffer-
ing - and
strength of
Kim. Her
voice is both
powerful and
gentle, each note fueled by an inner
ferocity that allows her character to do
what is necessary. She and Noonan per-
form well together, bringing a sense of
urgency to each of their songs. While
Noonan is both a solid actor and ﬁne
voice, he lacks the charisma and charm
needed to carry the role to perfection.
Kevin Gray provides a measure of
comic relief to the show. His portrayal
of the underhanded Engineer, who
often directly addresses the audience, is
captivating. Gray’s superb dancing and .
singing ability brings a vibrance to
each of his numbers, often giving the
audience a much-needed break from

the intensity of the war and its after-

math. '

The production’s scenery, lighting
and effects are fantastic, from_ elaborate
city streets to misty mornings and hum.-
ble interiors. Its most notable technical
achievement, perhaps, is the front part
of the helicopter that lands on stage,
accented ‘by fog, strobe lights, and the
thunderous beating of the propeller.'
With this and other such spectacular
effects, the audience is given a taste of
the sights and sounds of the Vietnam
War. » —

The Pittsburgh CLO, one of only
three theaters nationwide with permis-
sion to produce “Miss Saigon” this
year, has created an absolutely tremen— V
dous show. Its soulful musical numbers
are sure to ‘strike a chord in the hearts

' of its audience members. Following the

Let’s say you’re a fan of Van
Halen, "but you know you’ll never
have the chance to see them live. Or
maybe you were too young to go to
a Nirvana concert and now you
wish you had the chance. Was that
last U2 concert too much for your
wallet to take? Wish you could see
Alice Cooper and not be put off by
just how old and weird he looks
now with all that make-up?

Don’t fret; the solution to these
problems lies with Fake Fest 3: Re-
heated. 4'

Fake Fest is a gathering of all
the best cover bands you’d hope to
find under one roof, or tent, in this
case. V Performing will be The
Atomic Punks, one of the best Van

‘Halen cover bands around, Zoo

Station, a U2 tribute group,’ Teen
Spirit, paying homage to Nirvana,
and Mr. Nice Guy, an Alice Cooper
tribute band, among others.

These aren’t cheap karaoke bar
imitators we’re talking about here.

How the West Was Won
Led Zeppelin

Atlantic

t‘ni‘rl‘r1/2

It’s usually money, rather than love of the
music, that drives bands to throw together com-
pilation albums. Not so with Led Zeppelin. The
influential rock band’s latest collection, How the
West Was Won, hasn’t plucked songs from their
nine previous albums — compilations and box
sets excluded — but instead gives fans music
they haven’t heard before. Unless you were at
the LA Forum on June 25, 1972, or the Long

‘ Beach Arena two days later, this is the first time

you can hear the versions on this album.

When phenomenal Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy‘

Page was sifting through the band’s archives in
search of material for “Led Zeppelin DVD,” he
came across these recordings that are, according
to Page, “Led Zeppelin at its best.” '

The recorded concerts are spaced over three "

CDs. Disc one contains 10 tracks,including
“Stairway to Heaven,” which is similar to the
live version on- The Song Remains the Same,
where after the line, “And the forests will echo
with laughter” Page asks, “Does anybody
remember laughter?” On How the West Was Won,
though, he merely questions, “Remember laugh-

Move over, Duke, there’s a new sheriff in town

ter?”

“Heartbreaker” is a little faster than its stu-
dio counterpart and isn’t followed by “Living
Loving Maid (She’s Just a Woman),” the way
local radio stations like to play the two songs.
The acoustic guitar isn’t played at all on “Over
the Hills and Far Away,” and the riffs themselves

   

are a little bit mufﬂed —— but that is the beauty of

live music.
On disc two, there are only four songs. This
is because “Dazed and Confused” clocks i_n at 25
minutes and~25 seconds. While guitar and drum
solos by the legendary John Bonham help to
stretch the tune out’,”they break into the melodies
of “The Crunge,_” where Page simply

sings, “Do the crunge.” The fourth track is
a version of “Moby Dick” that lasts more
than 19 minutes. _ V
The last disc in the set opens with a 23-
minute “Whole Lotta Love.” This track
has help sustaining its long musical
stretch — John Lee Hooker’s “Boogie
Chillun” is in the melody, and lines from
“Let’s Have a Party,” “Hello Marylou”
and “Going Down S1ow” are all thrown
into the lyrical mix. .
How the West Was Won is reasonably
priced, not that money is ever an object
for Zeppelin fans. Although most of us
were years away from kicking in the
womb when these concerts were recorded,
we can still appreciate them for what they
are — truly ‘great live tunes. If bands
3 . today could even partially duplicate Led
Zeppelin’s talent, the music industry
wouldn’t be in such dire straits. _

Radiohead’s watching you

Hail To The Thief
Radiohead

Capitol Records
vﬁ'<.“n.“n2r

The best things in life are
acquired tastes. Classical music,
fine wine and Radiohead are a few
examples. Hail to the Thief,
Radiohead’s sixth studio album, is
what lead-singer Thom Yorke calls
“dark pop.” And yes, dark pop
rocks.

Hail to the Thiefis not an overt-
ly political record. It seems that
while other bands sing about anger,
Radiohead sings songs of some-
thing different: fear. In the opening
track, “2+2=5,” Yorke coos about a
lack of control similar to that pre-
sented in George Orwell’s “l984.” ’

In the funereal “I Will”, Yorke
fears for the future of his 2-year old
son Noah — “I won’t let this hap-
pen to my children” — but shows
hope in the beautifully arranged
“Sail to the Moon,”
“Maybe you’ll be president/but
know right from wrong/or in the
flood you’ll build an Ark and sail us
to the moon.”

In the powerful love song,

singing: ‘a

“Where I End and You Begin” he
sings, “There’s a gap where we
meet/where I ‘end
begin/and I’m sorry for us.” It also
contains songs about euthanasia —
“Go to Sleep” -— and dead rabbits
— “Myxomatosis.” ’

Hail to the Thief,,like past
Radiohead releases, isn’t an easy
listen. It is obvious that the mem—
bers of Radiohead believe good pop
music must be difficult —— most
likely a lesson learned from the
release of the hit song “Creep,”
which almost disbanded them over
10 years ago. Thus, Hail to the
Thief requires repeated listens to
appreciate.

As with all good music, each
song improves with every listen.
Once you uncover the melodies
underneath the sound, they never
leave you. In the end, Hail to the

Thief is truly a masterful collection’

of songs that prove Radiohead is
still the best band in the business.

Rooney

Rooney
Geffen
ﬁr

Keanu Reeves, Jared Leto, Kevin
Bacon, Jennifer Love Hewitt and
Bruce Willis are alike in two ways.
First off, every actor or actress listed
above has, in one way or another,
ventured from his or her duties on the
silver screen into the land of music
stardom. Secondly, their ventures
have almost always been as laugh-
able as they were atrocious. .

And so we find Robert Carmine
(a.k.a. Robert Schwartzman) -—' kid
brother to “Rushmore” star/Phantom
Planet drummer Jason Schwartzman
— is a young actor himself, with
roles in “The Virgin Suicides” and
“The Princess Diaries.” As you may
have already guessed by now,
Carmine is in a band. The name of
that band is Rooney, and they play
the some of the meanest wannabe-
vintage pop-rock tunes this side of a‘
“That ‘70s Show” episode. They’ve

even got the denim outfits andrnod

haircuts to prove it.
Thirty seconds into the opening
track, “Blueside,” it’s easy to tell

from whom Rooney attempts to‘ sum-
mon their ‘pop sound: Buddy Holly,
Lennon and McCartney, Brian
Wilson and a little bit of Rivers
Cuomo of Weezer for good measure.
Hell, Ric Ocasek of the Carseven
lent them a guitar during the record-
ing of this album. Badass!

The only redeeming ‘feature of
Rooney is that Carmine’s songs,
despite what they lack in substance,
are well-produced and well-per-

formed. The attention to detail is cer- -

tainly’ there, as the band obviously
spends much time adding nuance to
their simple pop songs.

That said, the way Rooney
sounds doesn’t change the -fact
Carmine’s songs and lyrics are just
plain boring. The most contemptible
thing about Carmine is found in the
lyrics to “Popstars,” in which he
sneers, “Hey digital, you»’re nothing
but a ‘bitch on strings/You’ll be back
milking cows before you cash the
check.”

Coming from a 20-year-old, star-

-ry-eyed pretty boy like Carmine,

whose career in film and music is, no
doubt, due his big brother’s success
in both, it’s easy to see how Carmine

has skipped “milking cows” and gone .

straight to “cash the check.” So, real-
ly, who’s the “bitch on strings?”

Film Review

a 2 Fast 2 Furious

Starring Paul Walker, Tyrese,
Ludacns .
Directed by John Singleton
i‘r1/2 t

V In the lobby, after “2 Fast 2
Furious:” _ -

“Whose do you think was th
best performance?” .

“I don’t know. Maybe the BMW
M3. Or the 2003 Viper.”’

That about sums up the film. If
it’s just cars you want, you might
leave happy. The racing is done with _
little excitement, but the cars are
technically on the screen. If you’re
looking for more —— a plot, maybe ——
steer clear.

Estranged cop Brian O’Conner
(Paul Walker) gets busted for illegal
car racing. Of course, he can have
the charges dropped — and his sins
of the first “Fast” film forgiven —— if

_ he helps the FBI by infiltrating a
‘drug lord’s operation as a “driver.”

Apparently, in Miami, boyish speed
freaks in fluorescent racecars are the
preferred couriers of drugs and
money. Brian agrees to do it on the
condition that he can bring along his
boyhood pal, Roman (Tyrese), to get
his back. The guys wrestle, drive
around doing obnoxious road stunts,
and say “bro” a whole lot. And they
almost never wear seatbelts.

Walker is consistently uninter-
esting; he’s like a parody of Keanu

Reeves. Tyrese, on the other hand, is
surprisingly capable when the mate-
rial is half-decent. It’s a shame the

%script only offers lines like, “All

right, let’s see what this. thing can
do.” Rapper Ludacris does little

more thanshow off a ’fro and per— 

form on the soundtrack.

The most interesting thing on the
screen is the remarkable face of
young Devon Aoki, who plays the
film’s one female racer.

What has become of director
John Singleton? Isn’t this the man

-who made “Boyz N the Hood?” His

fall to these commercial depths is
appalling.

It would have been cute to say,
“‘2 Fast, 2 Furious,’ 2 stars,” but
that would be more than the film
deserves. Proceed with caution.

Pitt’s Evangelista drafted by Blue Jays

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

-Last week Major League Baseball held their
annual First Year Player Draft. More than 1,400
players were drafted by the 30 Major League fran-
chises over three days. .

Pitt pitcher Nick Evangelista was the only Pitt
playerselected in the draft, and one of 18 Big East
players drafted.

The Toronto Blue Jays selected Evangelista as
the‘710th overall pick in the 24th
round. The selection of Evangelista
in the draft was no surprise to Pitt '
head baseball coach Joe Jordano,

went was.
“I thought [Evangelista] would

he was as good a pitcher as we saw.
this year.” i

This season Evangelista went 8-
:5 with a 3.32 ERA. He led the team

-with 89- 1/3 innings pitched, six

complete games and 76 strikeouts,
while walking only 20 batters over

the course of the season.

“[Evangelista] was throwing
90-92 miles per hour and he had a good breaking

_bal1,” J ordano said. “There were several scouts at all

his starts, and he ended the season on’a high note.”

Run support was limited for Evangelista during
the season. In his five losses, the Panthers scored
only six total runs, while they scored-50 runs in his

_ eight wins. Now the six—foot—three—inch, right—hand—
‘ ed pitcher will be able to take his skills to the next

level —— north of the border. '

. “I , believe
[Evangelista]
was as good a T
pitchers as we
Saw this year. ”

Joe Jordano
Pitt baseball head coach

The MLB draft is unlike the basketball or foot-
ball draft. College players are eligible after their
junior season and are able to return to their respec-
tive schools if they are drafted but do not sign with
the ball club that drafted them.

. Three other Pitt players were eligible for the '1
draft last week: shortstop Bryan Spamer, pitcher

Don Rhoten and pitcher Jeff Barnyak. None of the
three were drafted andall three will return to Pitt for
their senior seasons.

“Scouts knew they wouldn’t forego their senior

seasons, so no one drafted them,”

Jordano said.

As for the Big East Conference, this
marked the ﬁrst time since 1993 that
a player in the conference was not
drafted in the first round. West
Virginia centerﬁelder and Big East

V Co-Player of the Year Jarod Rine was
A the ﬁrst Big East player selected in
the ‘ninth round by the Baltimore
Orioles. .

The ﬁrst pitcher selected from the
Big East was Notre Dame’s J.P.
Gagne, who went to the Colorado
Rockies with the 407th overall pick
in the 14th round. Out of the 18 Big
East players selected, 12 were pitch-

ers. .
Evangelista will have some- company from his
conference at the Blue Jays spring training site next
April, since Toronto selected Rutgers’ third baseman
Vinnie Esposito in the 22nd round with the 650th
overall pick.

Connecticut, Notre Dame and Seton Hall each
had three players selected, while St. John’s,
Villanova and West Virginia each had two players

Pitcher Nick Evangelista was drafted by Toronto in

drafted. Pitt, Rutgers and Virginia Tech rounded out
the Big East selections with one player each select-
ed in the 2003 draft.

“The conference had a little of a down year,”
Jordano said. “But we have: great young talent. The
sophomores around the conference are excellent,
and there are definitely some potential first rounders
for next year’s draft.” V 

Pitt, four other Big East universities file lawsuit

 

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

The Atlantic, Coast Conference’s

V attempt. to expand took another turn
_ Friday, when the five remaining foot-

ball schools in the Big East filed a.
lawsuit against the University of
Miami, Boston College and the ACC,
accusing the three of placing eco-
nomic self—interest before public
interest.

Filed in state Superior Court in
Hartford, Conn., the lawsuit states
that Miami and Boston College, in
collusion with the ACC and its mem-
bers, violated their legal obligations
and fiduciary duties to their partners
in the Big East.

The suit also claims that, while
Miami and Boston College were reas-

. suring thepublic that they were com-
mitted to keeping the conference
intact, the two schools were actively

planning their departure to the ACC. 

“Our universities have brought
this lawsuit with great regret and only
as a last resort,” the presidents of the
five remaining Big East schools —
Pitt, Rutgers, 1 Virginia Tech,
Connecticut and West Virginia —
said in a statement. “Unfortunately
the actions of Miami and B.C., in
concert with the ACC, simply left us
no choice but to act.” -

The Big East schools, according
to _the lawsuit, went‘ ahead with
expansions and upgrades worth “hun-
dreds of millions of dollars” to their
venues, under the assumption that the
conference would last for years to

. come.

Pitt has put the most effort into
improving its facilities, according to
the lawsuit. The University spent
$100 million on the Petersen Events
Center, and negotiated a long—term
lease agreement to play at Heinz
Field and to use a “multi-million dol-
lar practice and training facility.”

’ The lawsuit states that UConn
recently finished construction on a
$90 million football stadium in order
to move up to Division I-A football,
while Virginia Tech, who’s admit-
tance into the conference was “accel—
erated by a full year” in reliance on
Miami’s word, invested $37 million
to expand‘ its football ‘stadium.

“We worked tirelessly on a wide
range of fronts to deal constructively
with the issues presented,”
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said at

a press conference on Friday. “We ‘

have reached out in every imaginable
way. Those contacts left us, unfortu-
nately, with the clear and unanimous
sense that continuing such conversa-
tions would not be productive. As a
result, we reluctantly decided to seek
legal protection.”

With the departure of any mem-
bers, the Big East could lose substan-
tial amounts of revenue from bowl
games, the Bowl Championship

Series and television deals. Although .

nothing has become official, the ACC
has extended informal invitations to
Miami, Boston College and Syracuse
to switch conferences.

Syracuse was not named in the
lawsuit because the five universities

Lawsuit claims Miami and BC
held secret meetings with ACC

Lawsuit, page 15

said they found no evidence that the
school madeiany promises to stay in
the Big East.

However, Miami allegedly made
“repeated public and private state-
ments and commitments to the other
members of the Big East that it
intendedto remain a member of the
Big East and-that it had no intention
of leaving to join any other confer-
ence” despite the fact that Miami and
Boston College had been “engaged in
secret negotiations to leave the Big
East and join the ACC,” the lawsuit
claims.

The lawsuit also points out how
the other members of the Big East
supported both Miami and Boston
College when each university was
dealing with “separate crises that
threatened their continued viability
as participants in college athletics.”

In 1997, a criminal investigation
took place after Bostorr College ath-
letes were alleged to be involved in a
gambling scandal. In the mid—l990s,
Miami was placed on probation for
NCAA violations, reducing the num-
ber of football scholarships the
school could award. .

The lawsuit points out how the
other members of the conference
“stood behind these schools” and that
Miami and Boston College “contin-
ued to receive, in full, their respec-
tive financial and other entitlements
as Big East members.”

While the remaining Big East
schools hope that the lawsuit will
prevent Miami, Boston College or
Syracuse from defecting to the ACC,
Miami Athletics Director Paul Dee
believes that his school’s plans will
not change.

“The train’s not off the track but
it’s slowing down,” Dee said before
Miami played North Carolina State in
the NCAA baseball tournament’s
super regionals. “I’m sure there have
been lawsuits among friends before
over issues, and one way or another
they get//resolved and people get on
with it afterward.” V

Although not currently a member
in football, UConn is scheduled to
join the Big East in 2005. With their
contracts requiring a year’s notice for
any kind of departure from the Big
East-, Miami, Boston College and

Syracuse would not be able to join_

the ACC until the beginning of the
2004 football season.
