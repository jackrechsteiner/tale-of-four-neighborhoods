Students hit by car
in Bigelow crosswalk

J AMEs DEWEESE
Staff Writer

A vehicle struck two Pitt students as
they crossed Bigelow Boulevard
Saturday evening, leaving them injured
and hospitalized at UPMC Presbyterian
until late Sunday afternoon.

Matt Gaydos and Jennifer

Piesetzkie, both seniors, said they were

in the middle of the marked crosswalk
between the William Pitt Union drive-
way and the Cathedral of Learning when
a minivan hit them.

On Oct. 3, the crosswalk — one of
three between the Cathedral and the
Union — became part of a Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation program
aimed at reducing pedestrian fatalities
by placing brightly colored markers
within 50 feet of high-trafﬁc crossings.

At the time of the accident, the four
yellow reﬂective “yield to pedestrians
signs” were not in place. Pitt police
Chief Tim Delaney said the signs are not
_in place during the weekends.

Delaney said ofﬁcers generally posi-
tion the signs weekdays before 9 a.m.
and remove them at about 10 p.m. after
evening classes have ended.

Delaney said that when "Dom Costa,
commander of the city’s Zone 6 police

station, approached him about the
PennDOT pilot program, he wanted to
use the signs only at particular times to
heighten their impact.

“I wanted [the signs] at class change
times,” Delaney said. “This is the time
my kids are crossing [and] if a driver
gets used to something, he doesn’t see it
anymore.”

Delaney said that he is considering
placing the signs seven days a week and
will contact city police and PennDOT
officials to discuss the matter.

But he said the signs make no mate-
rial difference to the incident.

“Whether there’s a crosswalk or not,
you can’t drive through people on the
street,” Delaney said.

Delaney added that Pitt police have
been monitoring the area more closely
since the beginning of the program.
Delaney did not know whether police
had issued any citations directly related
to the crosswalk, but said he believes
that enforcement has had a positive
effect. ‘

“We’re seeing a more vehicular con-
gested area, which means we’re slowing
them down,” Delaney said.

Gaydos said he has long regarded

State senator appointed to Board of Trustees

CHIRAG DEVASKAR
Staff Writer

State Sen. Jay Costa Jr. grew up mere minutes from
Pitt’s campus and worked in Pitt Stadium during football
games. Now, the longtime Pittsburgh resident has been
appointed to Pitt’s Board of Trustees.

“I am pleased and humbled by my appointment as a
trustee of the University of Pittsburgh,” Costa said in a
statement released by his ofﬁce. “As a University trustee, I
am well-positioned to work toward my goal of improving
our entire system of education throughout Pennsylvania.”

When reached by phone, Costa, who is a graduate of

Taylor-Allderdice High School in Squirrel Hill, noted his ‘

ties to Pitt and the Oakland community as reasons for seek-
ing appointment to the board.
“My wife is a Pitt graduate and I took four graduate

courses there,” he said. “I represent a lot of individuals,

who live and work in Oakland.”

Costa, who, as a commonwealth trustee is one of 12
appointed by the governor, president pro tempore of the
Senate and speaker of the house, also lived in the Oakland

area and worked at a local bar. His brother is also a Pitt

alumnus. . p
' ‘The University of Pittsburgh is not only a world-
renowned research and education institution,” Costa said
in the statement. “It is a critical component of the
Pittsburgh economy and an economic driver for the
region.” '
He also cited Pitt’s strong medical research facilities as
a reason for seeking appointment. Costa said he wants to
create more educational opportunities for all students.
“We need to ﬁnd ways to make it easier for more peo-
ple to go to college,” he said, noting a large increase in
tuition and the increased necessity for an undergraduate
degree in the workplace over the past 20 years.
In addition to serving as a trustee, Costa will serve on
the Board of Visitors for both the law and business schools.

“I have no agenda I’m looking to achieve,” he said. “I
just thought it would be a good opportunity to get involved
with the University.”

I University -spokesman Robert Hill did not return
phone calls seeking a comment regarding Costa’s appoint-
ment. .

Costa, a graduate of the Community College of
Allegheny County who received his bachelor’s degree
from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, was elected to
the 43rd state Senatorial District in 1996 and serves as the
democratic chairman of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee
and as a member of the Transportation, Public Health and
Welfare, Banking and Insurance committees.

Costa also has his own private practice as an attorney
with the Pittsburgh ﬁrm of Grogan, Graffam and
McGinley, P.C. '

Before his 1996 election to the state Senate, Costa was
register of wills in Allegheny County and also was a
deputy sheriff. A

AFL-CIO worker urges
students to get involved

TONI BARTONE
The Pitt News

Sam" Smucker and Cathy Stoddart vis-
ited a feminist theory class in the Cathedral
of Learning to spread the word about unions
and injustice in the workplace and to recruit
potential union organizers. I

Smucker, a coordinator in the
AFL—CIO Organizing, Institute, is visiting
select classes and organizations this week,
giving brief presentations on what the
Organizing Institute is about and asking for
student participation.

Stoddart, a registered nurse discussed
her personal experiences in starting a union
at Allegheny General Hospital in conjunc-
tion with Smucker’s presentation.

I The function of union organizing is to
assist workers in starting unions at their

places of work

Smucker has worked for the
Organizing Institute for six years and said
that he came to Pitt to recruit students for
union organizing and to encourage them to
consider it as. a career. As an organizer,

«Smucker speaks not only to employers, but

also to workers at their homes about the
conditions of the workplace. He said that his
efforts are not a sales pitch, but rather an
attempt to bring about change.

The Organizing Institute sponsors two

programs for those interested in union orga— V

nizing. L ~

The ﬁrst is a four-month paid appren-
ticeship for those strongly considering
union organizing as a" career.

The second, which is called Union
Summer, is a four-week paid internship that

goes on over the summer for those who r

want to learn more about union fonnation.
Both of these programs offer students ﬁrst-
hand experience working to get unions
started. The creation of unions involves
working on union organization campaigns,
contract campaigns and helping to organize
strikes. Through these programs, students
are sent to major cities across the United

States to work on the formation of unions. '
Smucker said that students had both

' good and bad experiences during the

apprenticeship program and Union
Summer. He explained that many students
in the program made progress in helping the
groups they worked with start unions.
Others encountered difﬁculty in forming

unions, which mostly arose ﬁom Union.

Locals that didn’t have good plans, requir-

ing the students and group working to form

the union to draw up plans from scratch.
During her presentation, Stoddart

shared her and her co-‘workers’ experiences, »

in starting a union for health care workers at
Allegheny General Hospital. She said that
there are no laws in the United States that
limit the number of hours nurses, doctors
and health care workers can work She said

that it was typical for nurses to work 20-

hours a day and added that mandatory over-
time was “indentured servitude.”

In addition to the long hours worked,

"‘[Nurses] didn’t have the right to say how
many patients we could take care 0 ,”
Stoddart said. '

She also pointed out the increased risk I

of injury to both patients and nurses

involved with rest-deprived nurses carin

for patients. -
After Stoddart and her colleagues

formed their ‘union, they reached a contract .

‘agreement with Allegheny General. The
agreement put limits on the number of hours
nurses worked, speciﬁcally by prohibiting
mandatory overtime, and on how many
patients they see at one time. Stoddart said
that she received her ﬁrst raise in ﬁve years
as a result of the agreement. -

Other parts of the agreement included a
condition allowing workers to obtain a
union leave of absence to work with other
hospital workers in forming unions.

Stoddart pointed out that people who
start. unions are not professional lobbyists
but middle-class workers and that they often’
“don’t realize that you can ﬁght a big orga—
nization.” _ —

the crosswalk as dangerous.

“That crosswalk freaks me out any-
way,” he said. “I’m always looking out.”

When Gaydos and Piesetzkie began
to walk across Bigelow Boulevard in the
direction of the Union just after 7 p.m.,
the sun had already set. But according to
both, the area remained well-lit.

“[After the accident] I remember
looking around and seeing faces,”
Piesetzkie said. “It was bright enough to

see people’s faces.”

According to Gaydos, some cars had
already slowed as the two neared the
double yellow lines that mark the center
of the street. Gaydos said he saw anoth-
er vehicle approaching, but believed that
it was slowing too.

‘.‘We saw it and we ﬁgured he saw
us,” Gaydos said. “After that, we were in
the next lane.”

Piesetzkie said Gaydos, who was
walking on the side nearer the minivan,
was struck first.

Habitat volunteers trick
or treat for housing cash

LEE ANNE HUTCHISON
The Pitt News

A cowgirl, kitty cat, football player,
princess and ﬂower braved the streets of
Shadyside Wednesday night in search of
more than just candy.

These trick or treaters wanted money.

Along with their fellow, younger trick
or treaters, several members of Pitt’s cam-
pus chapter of Habitat for Humanity, went

door-to-door asking for donations to help .

raise money for the club’s current project.
“People in this area were very sup-
portive,” » said sophomore Crystal
Rothermel, social_ chair of Habitat for
Humanity and cowgirl for the evening.
Along with accepting donations,
members handed out brochures informing
the community about Pitt’s chapter of

Habitat for Humanity.

“This was a really effective way of
raising awareness in the surrounding com-
munities in Pittsburgh,” said Melissa
Clark, president of Habitat for Humanity.

Contributions ranged. from spare
change to $10. Several residents invited
the members in to talk and learn a little
more about their cause.

, ‘This is a great idea,” said Shadyside
resident Lauren Dick. “I didn’t even know
that Pitt had a Habitat for Humanity. It’s
good to see people trying to make a differ-
ence in our own city, and I love to help.”

Pitt’s chapter of Habitat has spent two
years raising money to sponsor a homein
the Hill District. The club has raised most
of the $50,000 required to build the home,
and construction is scheduled to begin in

mid-January.

'While a signiﬁcant portion of the
needed ﬁmds comes from frmdraising,
contributions and grants make up a large
part of their funding. --

Last year alone, an anonymous per— Vi

son from the Belleﬁeldl Presbyterian
Church gave the group a $10,000 check.
The chapter also received a $10,000 grant
from a recycling program called,
“Aluminum Cans Build Habitat Houses,”
a program in conjunction with the
University that allows the club to give
glass, aluminum and plastic from campus
to the Pittsburgh Recycling Center "in
exchange for money.

This year, Pitt’s chapter received a
grant from the Northeast Regional
Division of Habitat for Humanity that
matches every dollar Pitt’s chapter raises
with three of its own. The grant allows
them up to a $20,000 donation with
$5,000 of the money raised solely by the
club. A

According to sophomore Jessica
Mooney, fundraising chair for the club,
members raised close to $100 . on
Wednesday night. ' l

0 “Every dollar counts,” Mooney said.
“And with the help from our grant,
Wednesday’s totals are closer to $400,
since every one of our dollars is matched
by three from the grant.” .

Clark agreed. ' j \

“Overall, I think we did a great job,”
she said. “Not only did we raise some
money, but we got our name out in the
community and gave people a chance to
contribute to a good cause.”

Police continue accident investigation

Accident, page 2

“I saw him get hit and try to jump 1

out of the way,” Piesetzkie said. “I knew
I was next.” 0

Piesetzkie said she landed near the
curb closest to the Union ——- a full lane
from where she said the two were initial-
ly struck. ,

According to Piesetzkie, a crowd
quickly assembled around her while she
was on the ground and she shouted for

- ’ one of the onlookers to call for help.

“I couldn’t get up and I didn’t want
to,” she said. “I was paralyzed with
fear.” —
Gaydos said he approached
Piesetzkie to make certain she was OK
before realizing the extent of his own
injuries. . -

“I was just trying to assess what the
hell was happening,” he said. “It was
surreal. I was bleeding [and] my glasses
were broken.” ~

Gaydos said that, among other
injuries, he suffered a broken wrist,
bruises and contusions above his knee
and cuts on his face. ‘ -

Piesetzkie said that when‘ she
entered the hospital, her blood pressure
had dropped severely. Now out of the
hospital, she said she’ needs crutches to
walk, and will likely not return to class
until at least Monday. ,

The city police have not made their
report available, but Delaney said the
Pitt police report indicated that the driver
of the minivan stopped immediately and
spoke with city police. Delaney also said
the accident remains under investigation.

Gaydos and Piesetzkie urge witness-
es to the accident to contact thepolice.
The Zone 6 police station can be reached

Eviction raises suspicions

Refusal to divulge information indi-
cates something to hide.

The University’s comments — or lack
thereof — on its eviction of vendors outside
the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union have given stu-
dents reason to wonder if the University
is, indeed, hiding something. ‘

Yesterday, the vendors were officially

“kicked off of school property.

Why? Well, that’s uncertain.
Last week, Director of Student

Activities Joe Cavalla cited the city’s.

recent vending ordinance as the reason for
the University’s action. But this ordinance
only applies to public property — not to
Pitt.

This week, University spokesman
Robert Hill cited conﬂicts with Pitt’s con-
tracts with larger vendors.

He also told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette that the University" had received
one complaint about selling of counterfeit
goods.

Hill only spoke of the University’s
contract with PepsiCo Inc. and said that
some vendors had given out complimen-
tary beverages from competing compa-
nies.

But he would not give any more
speciﬁcs, such as how frequently that hap-
pened, if any other vendors had “inter-
fered” with contracts or if someone even
complained about it in the ﬁrst place.

In other words, just like the reasons
for the vendors’ disappearance cited by

Cavalla last week, Hill’s new reasons
don’t seem to hold water either. ’

And yet, the University told the media
more than it told the vendors. Many of
them remain in the dark about why they
had to leave by yesterday. Even if it’s not
required, it’s common courtesy to tell peo-
ple why they’re being booted.

Students are left wondering why we
were never consulted. Rather than taking
the unilateral action it did, the University
should have ﬁrst consulted us. How does
this decision affect Executive Vice
Chancellor Jerome Cochran, who Hill told
the Post-Gazette made the ﬁnal decision,
more than students? '

The University should instead seek a
solution that will make everyone happy.
But to do that, it must give everyone
involved the information to make an
infomzed decision. It should not think it
has the power to make that decision for us.

The University’s refusal to divulge
information has created an atmosphere of
suspicion and has again reinforced many
students’ perceptions of the administration
as being shady and unresponsive to those
it serves.

Information quells fear of the
unknown and leads to rational, informed
debate, which the University should pre-
fer.

But by refusing to divulge informa-
tion, the University is not allowing that
debate to happen.

Post-black power depression:
making Afrocentricity matter

,When I was 12, my father took
me to a conference at Temple
University that dealt with this
strange ‘ notion called
“Afrocentricity.” Here people ranted
about people named El Hajj Malik

teachers, clergymen and even my
parents. It caused me to question the

stereotypes that black people cycli- .-

cally perpetuate of themselves. And
it moved me to agitate lawmakers
and enforcers who operate from

Shabazz,' . Huey P.
Newton and Mumia Abu-
Jamal. I attended. work-
shops conducted by peo-
ple with even stranger
names like Molefi
Asante and Askia Toure.
They sang praises for
some man named Cheikh
Ante Diop as if he were a .
god. -

The college relationship handbook

The world of relationships is a tough
pickle to squeeze, but college students sure
are a crafty bunch. They always ﬁnd quirky
ways to work within the crooked alleyways
oflove and sex and land that dream date. I,
too, have a foolproof way for students to
make that sweet love connection. Don’t
worry girls, this will clue you in to the inner
workings of the college guy’s mind.

The ﬁrst step is getting that person’s
attention. A lot of guys look at that pretty
girl in calculus class and wonder if she is
“the one,” and a girl will wonder if the guy
she met at that party will still look as good
when she’s not tanked up on margaritas.
But you’ll never know the truth unless you
actually verbally communicate with that
person. For those of you who are unedu-
cated on the subject, the laymen’s term for
it is talking.

The classroom matchup is a tough one
to handle, but getting that person’s attention
is only a pencil eraser away. All you need
to do is sit behind that person and poke him
or her in the head with your pencil. Sure, at
first that person will think you’re a nutball,
but after you start up the conversation,
you’ll be able to let the natural charm take
over. .

The second step in landing this ﬁsh is
keeping his or her interest. Girls, pay atten-
tion here. Most guys are easily distracted
by shiny objects, cars, loud noises or par-
ticularly the knockers on that girl on the
other side of the room. So you must keep
talking to him, try to make eye contact and
for God’s sake, be interesting.

Living wage equals
inflation, unemployment

I would first like to premise this
letter by clearly stating that I do not
“like” Sodexho Marriott in any con-
ceivable way. But I feel that someone
must stand up and refute Students in
Solidarity’s living wage campaign.
The “living wage” theory may be a
warm and fuzzy idea, but it is not a
guarantee in our capitalist market
economy.

From‘ a personal standpoint,
increasing the wages of Sodexho
Marriott employees to the “living
wage” would have a direct negative
effect on the student body, as Sodexho
Marriott would be forced to increase
its already abnormally inﬂated prices
even further.

But from an economic viewpoint,
the “living wage” does nothing but
disrupt the labor market and cause

inﬂation. The labor market is dictated.

Conversation has gotten so melan-
choly lately that it’s a wonder that anyone
dates at all. Rather than telling the person;
about your small hometown outside of,

Philly, try a witty anecdote about how you

were once mistaken for a member of
Destiny’s Child. I use that one all the time,
but as always, results may vary.

Now we all know that most college
relationships don’t last forever. So you
need to know exactly how to break up with
someone. Does the saying “we’ll still be
frien ” mean anything to you? 'Ihat’s a
big steaming load of bull. No one ever real-
ly remains friends after they break up. So

by supply and demand. Remember,
Sodexho Marriott employees willingly
entered into a wage/labor agreement
with the company. If they believed
their services were worth $9.12 an
hour, they were free to refuse a job
offer from -Sodexho Marriott and seek
employment elsewhere.

As long as people are willing to
work for a given wage, be it‘ $5.15,
$5.50, $6 or whatever, the market is in
equilibrium. Supply equals demand.
Sodexho Marriott is a business, and it
would be totally imprudent for it to
arbitrarily decide to raise wages to
$9.12.

If all businesses would act in this
irresponsible fashion, raising all
salaries up to the “living wage,” it
would only result in either higher
unemployment or higher prices (inﬂa-
tion). Firms would either lay off
workers in order to pay the remaining
workers higher wages or raise prices
to cover the costs. Both results are
undesirable.

In the first scenario, workers who
were previously making $5.50 are laid
off and will now be earning no
income. In the second scenario, the

income. But with the increase in
prices, they cannot actually purchase
any more goods and services than
they could before. In addition, skilled
workers who already earned more
than the “living wage” and did not
receive the increase suffer a theoreti-
cal pay cutcan now only afford to buy
a portion of what they previously
were able to buy with their salaries.
The “living wage” only hurts the
economy and disrupts market equilib-
rium in the long run. The advocates of
such a proposal must realize that we
do not -live in a communist or socialist-
society, and that in our capitalistic
society, a worker is only worth as
much as the market is willing to pay.

Many who [arrive at this cross-

levied upon their souls: either

Some are of the opinion that

I disagree, but truth rings,
through that argument if the knowl-

not applied. It makes no_ sense to
know that ancient black Egyptians

created the first sciences, philoso- « '

those same successes.

Oddball rockers hit Roboto  

Les Savy Fav

The Apes _

Sunday, 7:30 p.m.
Rob_oto II, $5 j
www.therobotoproject.org

GORDON SUN
Staff Writer

Oddball rockers Les Savy,Fav and their crazy
Frenchkiss labelmates the Apes will stun audi-
ences this weekend when they appear at Roboto H.

The Apes quartet recorded their 2001 debut,
The Fugue in the Fog, with an unorthodox lineup
consisting of drums, bass, Moog synthesizer,

« , organ and “voices.” The result is a screeching col-

lection of tracks that rarely strays from the formu-
la of a simple organ or Moog melody, crashing

‘percussion, fuzzed—out bass and mostly indeci-

pherable lyrics.

The Apes destroy traditional song structures
like a verse—and—chorus setup; the first track,
“Intro,” lastsall of three seconds. In the majority
of the other tracks, the Apes leave a massive
wreckage of noisy riffs and bruising drum breaks
in their wake. Les Savy Fav, on the other hand,

' takes experimentalism in a more listenable direc-

t1on.
' Les Savy Fav’s newest release, Go Forth, is an
excellent example of how to alter standard rock

” music arrangements with more pleasing results,
‘ without causing a frenzied ruckus. While the

band’s lyrics are cryptic, they can be heard quite
clearly within the well-produced mix. Sharp guitar

 

lines, muscular drumming and rhythmic bass aug-
ment the vocals. Stylistic diversity makes this
band stand out. .

_’Les Savy Fav avoid the tendency of most

mainstream punk rockers nowadays to beat their

chests over juvenile topics, insteadcovering more
profound subjects like the mentally handicapped,
kidnappings and visions of burning bushes that
talk about the apocalypse. ’ ~

The versatility of drummer Harrison Haynes
is evident through the album. His ability to easily
switch tempos and _rhythms makes instant standout
tracks out of “Crawling Can Be Beautiful,” which
begins with a synthesized dance beat that leads
into an accelerated drum and handclap rhythm,
and “Disco Drive,” which is somehow, reminiscent
of an off-key, harsher B—52’s.

» Go Forth effectively demonstrates that a slick-
ly produced, wall-of-sound approach is not always
necessary to compose a solid tune. While Les
Savy Fav can rock out completely, as on
“Adopduction,” many other songs, like “The
Slip,” emphasize a prominent rhythm over
melody. “Daily Dares” spends over two minutes

mixing plucked moody guitar and bass notes, sans‘

lyrics, before descending into a deafening ﬁnale.

. Expect Les Savy Fav to be both cerebral and
groovy — that is, if the Apes’ sonic onslaught
doesn’t tire you out ﬁrst.

 

Coming to grips
with scary movies

I have a confession to make: I hate
scary movies. .

Last weekend, my friends and I
made plans to see a movie. While hag-
gling—over a decision, we hauled out the
City Paper, and discovered that “The
Others” was still playing at a super-
saver movie theater. right outside the
city. I staunchly refused to go, much to
the amusement of my ﬁlm friends.

“I hate scary movies,” I said of the
supernatural thriller starring Nicole
Kidman. “I hate them, I won’t go.”

They laughed at me.

But it’s uue — I haven’t seen “The Blair Witch Project,” I
watched “Scream”- with my hands over my eyes and the trailer
for “The Sixth Sense” gave me bad dreams.

Sometimes I feel like I’m the only person my age who was-
n’t raised on scary movies and doesn’t consider herself an expert
on the genre. Growing up, I somehow avoided these movies at
slumber parties, and I tn'ed to avoid embarrassing situations in
which I wo11ld have to decline a scary movie by arguing that the

Pourquoi?

Leslie Hoffman

‘ movie was probably pretty bad. And don’t tell me “I Know What

You Did Last Summer” wasn’t bad — because I actually saw
that one. ,

Somehow I’ve always been able to stomach slasher movies,
though. Even though I was startled a few times, I actually spent
most of “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” making fun of
the campy plot line and the characters’ collective stupidity. It’s
the supematural stuff that gets to me — ghosts and telekinesis
and possession. Guess what — I’ve never seen “The Exorcist”
either. . '

And it’s not just frightening movies. I’ve always avoided
supernatural stories of all genres. When I was very young, I
passed up the popular “Goosebumps” series; the Nancy Drew
spooks always ended up being just 1onely- outcasts. A couple of
years ago I broke down and tore through Henry James’ captivat-
ing ‘Turn of the Screw,” but then I had to deal with dreams in
which I confronted eerie specters. I will never watch a ﬁlm adap-
tation of that book. Never. - _

But with the exception of “The Others” —- which I now
have to think of new ways to avoid, because my friends have
sworn that I will see that movie -—- I actually think I’m getting
better. 1 ~

In fact, I’ve recently found myself addicted to “Buffy the
Vampire Slayer” re-runs. Granted, it’s a television show, but
there’s still the creepy supematural element, demons and disﬁg-
ured vampires running all over the “hellmouth” of Buffy’s town.

I do take some satisfaction in watching Buffy destroy vam-
pires. I enjoy the fact that there’s always a stick of wood lying
around to plunge into the vampires,. and that when Buffy ﬁnally
does destroy one of those creeps, he or she disintegrates ‘into a
million dust particles. _

It’s really satisfying: '

Maybe if Nicole Kidman whipped out a stake and started
kung fu ﬁghting some vampires I could get behind “The
Others.” Until then, I’ll thinkup some clever ways to get out of
seeing it. ‘ - '

Monsters, Inc.

With the voices of John _ I
Goodman and Billy Crysta|__~f
Directed by Pete Docter and.
David Silverman

vkihﬁri/2

Monstropolis. A bustling city'5:like
any other, with problems like any other,
including an energy crisis and a popula-
tion struggling to change with the times.

Monstropolis is a city that exists on
the other side of the closet door, popu-
lated by the monsters that go bump in
the night. The city is fueled by the
screams of the kids in our world. The
monsters scare to survive. Now, the kids
aren’t being scared as easily because of
the images they see on TV.

Pete Docter and David Silverman,
the makers of “Toy Story” and “A Bug’s
Life,” directed “Monsters, Inc.” Like
every Pixar movie, a memorable and
motley crew of characters make up the
cast, but James P. Sullivan (John
Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy
Crystal) are the two big characters —
though Mike is small, green and has
only one eye.

While the “Toy Story” movies and
“A Bug’s'Life” were child—oriented with

adult undertones, “Monsters, Inc.” takes
the opposite approach. It is much more
serious, but also very playful. .2

A kid gets into Monstropolis. via’ an

unclosed opening into -the monster

world. This creates very funny situa-

tions because the monsters are more
afraid of the kid than the kid is of

monsters. But ‘there is a. more:serious»._’
side to it, dealing with corruption of  ‘
CEO of the scar§’“r,;fa£i°rya Henry   
Watemoose (James*5Gobum), ‘ who ‘-I is 

struggling with the energy crisis and the
changing times. '
“Monsters, Inc.” isn’t all serious.

There is an excellent scene with the

Abominable Snowman (John
Ratzenberger) — who, along with
Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, has
been banished from Monstropolis into
the human world. The Snowman is
incredibly funny and his scene is apro-
pos. Adding to this memorable scene is
the funny and uncarmy resemblance of
the Snowman to the Bumble from
“Rudolph, the Red—Nosed Reindeer.”
“Monsters, Inc.” is an excellent
movie, showing off new heights in am-
mation. And it doesn’t hurt that.the story
is told in an exciting way. Anyone going
to see “Monsters, Inc.” expecting to see
“Toy Story 3” will be disappointed. The
movie is fun, but more adult-oriented
than the “Toy Story” movies.

In case you haven’t gotten enough of
Halloween, “13 Ghosts” and “Bones” join
“Don’t Say a Word,” “From Hell,” and “Joy
Ride” as movies to give you a ﬂight this
Halloween.

In “Bones,” Patrick (Khalil Kain), an
upper-middle class youth plans to start a
dance club in his father’s old neighborhood
by renovating an old building that was last
owned by a man named Jimmy Bones.

During his heyday, Jimmy Bones
(Snoop Dogg), known only by rhymes,
ruled the neighborhood with “gold plated
deuce, like the king of Siam, a switch blade
loose and a diamond on his hand.”

Patrick and his four ﬂiends ﬁnd Jimmy
Bones’ body in the old building. “Odd that
he would stab himself in the chest, and bury
hirnse ,” one of the teens remarks. Through
ﬂashbacks we learn Jimmy Bones’ story and
his connection to the teenagers.

Is it scary?

The ﬁrst45 minutes areathrillridethat

Friday, November 2, 2001

 

left me pinned to my seat. I now have an
everlasting phobia of maggots. But the
scares quickly turn to spectacles during the
last half of this movie. The focus of the last
half of “Bones” seems to be less on ﬂight,
and more on looking neat. Decapitated
heads that talk and trips to hell are fun, but
not scary. .

Where “Bones” manages 45 minutes of
true ﬂight, “l3 Ghosts” conjures up a full
ride. By focusing less on plot and more on
scaring people, “l3 Ghosts” provides a great
show. The story is just enough. A rich col-
lector named Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham)

had collected 12 ghosts, but is killed after he

traps the 13th one.

Cyrus leaves his estate to his nephew
Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) and his two chil-
drenBobby and Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth).
The family travels to see Cyrus’ beautiful
estate, which is made of glass.

“Don’t throw stones, kids,” Arthur
remarks. Unknown to Arthur, the ghosts that
Cyrus collected power the estate. The
house’s labyrinthine setup and the ghosts’
freakish appearances make “l3 Ghosts” a
hair-raiser. '

“13 Ghosts” is perfect for getting into a

Halloween mood, the ghosts are great look-, ‘

ing and the set is wonderful. The house
Comes with shifting glass walls that allow
the ghosts, shown only through choppy
jump cuts, to scare even the strongest-willed
moviegoer.

Flattered imitation

Dan Bern
Tonight, 7:30 p.m.
M, $12

(412) 261-2221

If imitation is the sincerest form of ﬂattery, Dan Bern
owes thank-you letters to the following people: Bob Dylan,
Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello...

And if you can’t scrounge up some tickets to the con-
certs of the people on the list above, or any other neo-folk
artist that receives even a remote amount of airplay on NPR,
why not do the next best thing and see Bern live at Metropol

this Friday night.

The sound isn’t unique. It’s all been done before. But
just like Diet Dr. Pepper, Bern makes you believe it just
might be the real thing, and he kind of does make the world
taste better in a weird, folky way.

His lyrics speakto a generation looking for something
else in the musical spectrum, hence his newest release, New

_ American Language. And his impressive band, The
International Jewish Banking Conspiracy, supplies him
with a superb blend of down-home folk and old-fashioned
rock

The "resounding Dylan-esque lyrics and the fusion of
classic folk and rock sounds make Bern a worthy appren-
tice, and in some instances, an adequate substitute.

Songs like “Sweetness,” “God Said No” and

“Thanksgiving Day Parade” might be mistaken for a Dylan
tune due to Bem’s similar vocal styling.  . »
But “Turning Over,” and “Sweetness” take a page from
the collective works of Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen.
The audience will not be mistaken about who is on
stage when Bern launches into “New American Language”
and‘ “Alaska Highway” as he demonstrates just how origi-
nal he can be with his infectious and impressive pop-fo
combination. : 2 '
The crowd that goes to see Dan Bern will most likely
not be disappointed with his efforts, but if you happen to get
a little dissatisﬁed just close your eyes, click your heels three
times and repeat to yourself, "There’s no one like Bob!
There’s no one like Bob!”

One man show

Grant Lee Phillips
Tomorrow, 8:30 p.m.
Rosebud, $15

(412) 261-2221

Going solo isn’t always easy.
Remember when Greg Brady left the rest
of the bunch to pursue a career as “Johnny
Bravo?” Or when David Caruso dropped
his role on “NYPD Blue” like a bad habit
to star in feature ﬁlms? ‘

Some people can pull off the single
man act. Case in point: Grant Lee Phillips.

Phillips, founder and former frontman
for the critically acclaimed band, Grant Lee
Buffalo, released his sophomore solo
album, Mobilize, in August 2001. He will
perform songs from this album, as well as
some Grant Lee Buffalo standards, tomor-
row night at Rosebud.

The 12-track album, released on the
Cambridge, Mass.—based Zoe/Rounder
Records, plays with the Madonna/whore
complex. Mobilize has a childlike inno-
cence with an oh—so—naughty side.

It starts off with the sweet and idealis-
tic “See America.”. It’s slow and sleepy, but
eases you into the album’s second track,
“Humankind,” a catchy tune showcasing

    

Phillip’s striking harmonies. Throw in an
organ and an infectious beat, and you have
a song that’ll stick in your head for days.
Phillips isn’t all sunshine and rain-
bows, though. The album’s third track,
“Love’s a Mystery,” is reminiscent of ﬁlm

— noir with its eerie moans and somebody’s—

watching—you appeal. He adopts the voice
of a detective to discover secret lovers over
the airwaves, but ﬁnds out “passion pays
the law no mind.”

Mobilize continues with thumping
house beats like “Spring Released,” the
most obvious choice for radio play, and the
witty and honest “We All Get a Taste.” The
album’s title song is a call to action with a
highly appropriate industrial beat and pow-
erful lyrics. After the militant nature of the
title song, Phillips brings us back down to a
level Grant I/ee Buffalo fans are familiar
with — smart and accessible pop rock.

In the more poppy tunes on Mobilize,
Phillips sounds like Bono’s introspective
kid brother. In the softer tracks, compar-
isons to a slightly less depressing Elliot
Smith can be made.

Few people who leave the group that
brought them to stardom actually make it
on their own. From the sounds of Mobilize,
it looks like Phillips and his army of one are
doing just ﬁne. .

Topaz McGanigle, band member and
namesake, hails from New York City where
the band is renowned for its ability to rouse
an audience into a dancing fervor, along with
lively songs meant to bring people to their
feet Topaz also mellows out its repertoire
with smooth, toe-tapping jams with a metro-
politan feel.

Together with McGarrigle, whose hip
tenor saxophone ﬂows through and domi-
nates much of the songs, appears the blaring

trombone of Squantch, a musician whose
colorful hom sound is rivaled only by his
interesting name. While these two instru-
ments seem to front the majority of Topaz’s
unique melodies they also give ample show
to the other members of the band through
solos and grooving background rhythms.

Tewar, another member with one name,
jams his way on guitar through the songs
and steps up often to take the tunes down
paths verging on rock~‘n’ roll sound. The
cool back-up rhythms provided by Ethan
White on keyboard, Jason Kriveloff’s hard,
raw bass beats, and Christian Urich, with a
drum that can enthrall the listener just as
much as the horns, mix together into a fused
vehicle for a true, hip, funk sound.

All together, this is an extremely sophis-
ticated and modern sound worth investigat-
ing if you are interested in jazz, funk, orjust
a band that sounds good.

Jazz 31: Annual Seminar
and Concert

Seminars today and tomorrow
Concert tomorrow, 8 p.m.
Carnegie Music Hall

Students $8 with Pitt ID
(412) 648-7814

Forget the prim and proper atmos-
phere of Carnegie Music Hall.

According to Nathan Davis, the

founder and director of Jazz at Pitt,
tomorrow night, “there’s going to be a
lot of crazy funk going on.” '

For 31 years, the Jazz Seminar has
allowed students to learn from the mas-
ters of jazz. Davis began the seminar so
that his students could get more out of
his classes than what a textbook has to
offer.

“I didn’t want. it to be a stiff pro-
gram,” Davis said. In fact, had’ Pitt
refused to allow Davis to start the sem-
inar, he might still be playing his saxo-
phone in Paris. Davis left his job there
contingent on the fact that he would be
able to have major innovators of jazz
perform for and speak to his students.

" This was the seminar’s original
intent. Over the years, it has grown.
People now come from all over the city
to attend the lectures and enjoy the con-
cert.

“Pitt should be proud.” Davis said.

Not only is he the founder of Pitt’s
annual Jazz Seminar and Concert,
Davis is also a participant. He will play
the saxophone along with other saxo-

    

phonists Charles McPherson, James

Moody and Joe Lovano, trumpeters Jon
Faddis and Cecil Bridgewater, guitarist
Mark Whitfield, cellist David Baker,
pianist Kirk Lightsey, bass guitarist
Abraham Laboriel and drummer Terri
Lyne Carrington tomorrow night.

“Everyone is a killer,” Davis said
about the lineup. There are certain
musicians who stand out from the rest.
Laboriel, for example, is known for
“slapping the bass and jumping up and
down” while he performs. He doesn’t
just play his music; he dances to it.

The agenda for the concert
includes upbeat songs as well as some
ballads, There is even an original song
by Davis called “Mister—Funk-A-
Mess.” _

Davis got his start in jazz from a
preacher who lived next door to him as
a child. Ever since, he’s been hooked.
“It’s a good feeling,” Davis said,
“People ask me, ‘When are you going
to retire?’ And I tell them, ‘From what?
Life?’ ”

This week’s remaining lectures
include “Artistry and Rhythm” at 10

‘a.m., “Electrifying Strings” at 1 p.m.,

“Brass Connection” at 2:30 p.m. and
“Legends of Jazz” at 4 p.m. on Friday.
“Jazz Masters: Passing the Torch” at 10
a.m. - and “Rhythm Explosions” at
11:30 a.m. will be held on Saturday. All
seminars are free and meet in the
William Pitt Union Assembly Room.

‘ Saturday’s concert is close to sell-
ing out, but tickets are still available.
The proceeds will go to support Pitt’s
jazz archives, the recording studio pro-
gram and scholarships.

Tonight, 9 p.m.

2. Rosebud, $15
(412) 261-2221

Picture yourself cruising down an
endless highwayin a beat up 19603.
Van on .a warm afternoon, windows’
down, the -wind breezing through your
hair and the radio ‘cranked, ﬁlling the
air with songs of peace, love and hap-

and_ spiritual themes. It is no doubt
one of the reasons Donna the Buffalo
has gained somewhat of a cult follow-
ing of loyal fans. The band _has a
familiar home on the festival circuit
and is followed from stop to stop by
die-‘hard admirers who call themselves
“The Herd.”,In short, these fans are

hippies of the new millennium.
Donna the Buffalo traditionally
hosts the Finger ‘Lakes GrassRoots
Festival in Trumansburg, N.Y. every
summer to benefit AIDS programs as
well as arts and education. But this
year they have begun a new tradition,
a tour of their own —- the Donna the
Buffalo Roots

piness. What comes to mind — the
‘60s, ﬂower chil-
dren, Dylan,

CSNY, peaceful
pleasantries,
Volkswagen sym-
bols? ' How about

ring a bell, please
read on.

Donna the
Buffalo originated
in 1987, bringing .
together- musi— --
cians with a love for bluegrass fiddle
music. Their music is a combination
of everything from reggae to rock ‘n’,-

roll to country. Along with an unusual

style of instrumentation, the band cre-
ates a very unique sound. But for a
comparison, think Rusted Root. »

The group is known for the mes-
sages and moral challenges their lyrics
contain, including political, personal

 

Tour. Friends and
inﬂuences of the
band ﬁll the show,
including zydeco
artist Preston
Frank and the reg-
gae sounds of The
Overtakers.

Donna the
Buffalo recently
released their
fourth studio CD,
titled Positive
A Friction, which
has hit the top 20 on American radio
charts. They also have just‘ released
their first live recording, Live From
the American Ballroom.

The Donna the Buffalo Roots Tour
hits Pittsburgh tonight at Rosebud in
the Strip District. For more inforrna—

If you’ve been waiting all year for

a night of unabashed, unforgiving, and

underestimated punk music, your wait
is over because the Suicide Machines
are coming to Oakland.

, The Suicide Machines will grace
Club Laga with their presence on

- Sunday night in support of their new,

well-received album, Steal This
Record. .
The band is no stranger to‘ the tour-
ing scene, where they supercede their
audiences’ expectations.
Throughout their ten-year existence
they have relied heavily on their live
shows, which are what helped them
develop such a devoted fan base, con-
verting new followers with every stop

they make. -

Expect to hear gritty vocals, blar-
ing punk riffs, and crashing cymbals on
songs like “The Killing Blow” and ‘‘All
My People.” They’re perfect examples
of the band’s anthems that come stan-
dard in the Suicide Machines’ brand of
“takegno prisoners” punk.

s Also expect to hear some of the
surprises that surfaced on Steal This
Record. “The R.E.M. Song,” which is a

cover of “It’s the-End‘ of the World as

we Know It” mightbelplayed, and let’s

face it, when are you ever going to see .

a punk band do ‘anything associated
with Michael Stipe? It’s "-worth -your
money just for that. ,

The band might try out their newer
material with a sound evident on tracks
.from Steal This Record like “Stand-
Up” a song rich with a reggae vibes
and ska tones;

One of the best-kept secrets from A

modern rock radio, MTV and pretty
much every other place you might see
or hear music are. coming to Laga on
Sunday. Treat it like it’s church and go
check out the Suicide Machines.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Pitt teams
doing best to
underachieve

 

Spolrrs Vlzw

Karen Bielak

What in the world has happened
to Pitt sports?

Everyone already knows that
the football team has not met its
preseason expectations, when the
Panthers were chosen to finish third
in the Big East and give top teams
Miami and Virginia Tech some
trouble.

But some of the less popular
teams have faltered as well.

The men’s soccer team was dis-
appointing this season after going
13-5 last year and making it to the
Big East tournament with a 7-5
conference record. The Panthers
were ranked for a number of weeks
during the season, making it excit-
ing to follow the team.

But now, the men are just 5-7-3
with two games remaining and will
likely miss the playoffs.

I’ll admit, I’m not really a soc-
cer fan, but now I really have no
interest. Last season the team

intrigued me: they always kept me »

wondering if they won againor how
high they were ranked.

In a time that Pitt sports are suf-
fering, we need to try and bring that
excitement back. '

The volleyball team is also hav-
ing a major reversal season. Last
year they were 22-10 but so far this
season have managed to go just 7-
13. Head coach Chris Beerman
leaves ‘just about every gmatch
aggravated and disgusted with his
team.

Panthers win exhibition

Last night, the players of the
Pittsburgh Women’s Basketball
Association must have felt like they
were participating in a track meet
rather than an exhibition hoops
game, since the Pitt women were
running circles around them in a 98-

, The PWBA is made up of former
players from Pittsburgh area col-
leges, some of them very former,
and Pitt kept those older legs mov-
ing by experimenting with a quick-
paced offense in its first action of
the season at the Fitzgerald Field
House. . ' '
“ The result was fast break lay-
ups aplenty and rave reviews for the
new offensive style from coach and
players.

“We really wanted to go with an
up—tempo style,” said head coach
Traci Waites, “and to put 98 points
on the board, I was really impressed
With that.”

The quarterback for many of 1
those touchdownpasses was junior
point guard Laine Selwyn.

No.12 Hokies invade Heinz Field  

KEVIN NASH
Staff Writer

Many college football fans probably wondered whether
Virginia Tech quarterback Grant Noel would be able to fill the
shoes of Michael Vick, who was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons.

Since Noel took over, the Hokies average 37.4 points a game
compared to last. » _
year, when they averaged 40.3. But when‘ you break down who
was moreeffective in 7 . ' S
the passing game the stats point to Noel. .

Noel is currently the Big East’s No. 2-ranked passer behind —
Miarni’s Ken Dorsey and the statistics show that he has been able
to ﬁll the Void that Vick left behind.» Noel, although he is not near-
ly'as mobile, has more passing yards and touchdowns after 12
games and he has a better completion percentage.

Noel and the Hokies (6-1 overall, 3-1 Big East) come into
Heinz Field hungry, after their undefeated season ended in a 22- '
14 loss to Syracuse. The Orangemen held the Virginia Tech
offense to its lowest output all year. .

Borzaand Williams ‘gain

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Throughout the fall tennis schedule,
Jill Williams and‘Nikki Borza established

themselves as Pitt’s best 1-2 punch on the

courts. Last weekend, head coach George
Dieffenbach pitted his best against the top
performers of the east at the Rolex
Championship.

Pitt’s run at the tournament, held at the
University of Pennsylvania, was relatively
short, since Williams and Borza were up
against some of their most highly regarded
Big East rivals.

Williams went down in the ﬁrst round
of singles competition and Wﬂliarns and
Borza lost in the ﬁrst round of doubles. But
Dieifenbach believes his team still took a
lot away from the tournament.

“VVinning can sometimes be measured .

in learning,” said Dieﬂenbach. His team
now has some time off to build on its fall

performance before competition starts

again in F ebruaiy.
“The girls played hard and represent-
ed the University outstandingly,” he said.
\V11liams competed in the top section
of the singles tournament and faced off
against Georgetown’s best player, Liora
Gelblmn. Williams fell to Gelblum 6-1, 6-

experience at Rolex tourney  

4 in straight sets.

“Jill put up a good ﬁght,” said
Dieffenbach of the sophomore, who has
faced the opposition’s number one singles
player in each meet this fall. “It was very
even in the second set, but the other girl
just got more balls back, angled the ball
more and was in more control of the
match. Jill learned a lot from playing that
matc .” .

\V1lliams teamed up with Borza later
in the tournament, and they went against

Virginia Tech’s best duo of Meredith

Vincent and Carolyn Kramer. Wﬂﬁarns
and Borza lost the single set match 8-3.

“Those two girls controlled the net,
attacked, didn’t make many errors and
were more aggressive,” Dieifenbach said.

While they didn’t come away with
any wins, the experience the women got
from going up against the best in the Big
East could come in handy when spring
rolls around. The team will be seeing those
teams again. i '

Until then, Dieffenbach wants the
women to concentrate on academics. In
January, he’ll hold singles ‘challenges, giv-
ling all the team members a chance to shake
up the lineups.

The women’s next match is against
Mercyhurst College on Feb. 22.

of which Orangemen recovered. They
were held to 90 yards rushing and just 162
yards passing and Syracuse controlled the
time of possession.

Noel’s favorite target is ﬂanker Andre
Davis, who is Virginia Tech’s leading
receiver. Davis at 6 feet 1 inch, has a 3-
inch advantage over two of three Pitt’s
comerbacks as Torrie Cox and Wﬂﬁarn
Ferguson are both 5 feet 10 inches.

Look for Shawntae Spencer, who is
tallest of the three at 6 feet 2 inches, to
cover Davis.

The Hokies rotate running backs
Kevin Jones and Keith Burnell, with
Burnell getting the bulk of the carries.
They have combined for 1020 yards rush-
ing and 11 touchdowns.

Their offensive line has been the key
to the tearn’s success, with its players
averaging 296 pounds. .

Pitt’s defensive line has an average
weight of 270 pounds and has not fared
well in
stopping the run, especially against big
offensive lines as Syracuse, Miami and
Boston College, which dominated the line
of scrimmage. BC and Miami both racked
up over 240 yards, with Syracuse running
for 170 yards.

The biggest mismatch will be Hokies
314-pound offensive tackle Anthony

Davis, who matches up against Pitt’s 240-
pound defensive end Bryan Knight.

Another concern for Pitt’s defense
should be fullback Jarrett Ferguson catch-
ing the ball out of the backﬁeld. Ferguson
is currently Virginia Tech’s second leading
receiver.

Hokies’ linebackers Ben Taylor and
Brian Welch along with their front four
will look to stop Pitt running back
Raymond Kirkley, who only rushed for 25
yards on 10 carries last weekend.

Strong safety Kevin McCadam, who
leads ‘Virginia Tech in interceptions, is
another player to watch on defense.

David Priestley had an improved per-
formance against Temple last weekend
and Pitt was ﬁnally able to put more than
seven points on the board, despite four
fumbles.

Priestley completed 18 of 28 passes,
for 204 yards and two touchdowns and
threw no interceptions, which allowed for
him to take the majority of the snaps, with
backup Rod Rutherford seeing limited
action.

Priestley will need to keep an eye on
defensive tackles Chad Beasley and David
Pugh as Push leads the team with three
sacks.

The Hokies have won the last three .

meetings with Pitt. They lead the overall
series 7-1.
Kickoff is tomorrow at noon.

He has even said at times that he
can’t stand looking at the faces of
his players. Who could blame him?

The women’s soccer team fin-
ished its season Sunday with a loss
to No. 4 Penn- State, missing the
playoffs and ending with a 7-9-1
record. But while Pitt fans might be
disappointed about a losing season,
the .431 w_inning percentage the
Panthers put up is the highest in the
team’s 6-year history.

But as these sports are winding
down, fans now have winter sports
like basketball, wrestling, swim-
ming and gymnastics to look for-
ward to.

Will these teams be able to per-
form or will they be cursed just like
the rest of Pitt athletics this year?

It’s crushing to watch these
teams lose game after game. Sure,

fans will still attend tomorrow’s
football game against Virginia
Tech, but very few think the
Panthers have a chance. Many
expect to leave early, just like at
prior games. V

It’s very hard to be a believer
right now. It’s hard to support teams

that fans know are capable of win— '

ning.

V Pitt is a school rich with sports
history, and we need to return that
pride to the University. Fans need
to have a reason to be excited, a
reason to cheer and sport the blue
and gold.

Losing is getting old.

Karen Bielak is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News and hopes
the football team can at least pull
off a victory against Rutgers next
weekend so everyone from back
home does not make fun of her.

Panthers in double figures

B-ball, page 14

“I like the fast-tempo game,”
said Selwyn, who finished the night
with four assists to go along with 12
points and two steals. “I’m very
comfortable with it.”

So too it seems was junior cen-
ter Mandy Wittenmyer, who
wreaked havoc in the paint, despite
often being double, triple, and even
quadruple teamed. Wittenmyer did-
n’t often allow the defense to get set
on the inside, and when she did, she
still got her way, finishing the game
with 17 points and eight rebounds.

Wittenmyer got creative and her
highlight reel move of the game

came early, when she spun 360-
_ degrees and went in for a lay-up

untouched to put Pitt up 9-2.
“They weren’t a very physical
inside team,” said Wittenmyer of

the PWBA. “It’s good ‘to be able to '

try out different things.”

While Pitt continued to get the
ball quickly up court in the first
half, its defense of "the PWBA was
just as disruptive. The team had
three steals and forced 14 turnovers
in the first 20 minutes. The score at
halftime had Pitt up 52-40.

Sophomore forward Sheila
Stufflet, who finished with 10
points, opened up the second half
with a jumper from the left side to
keep Pitt rolling.

Soon after that, freshman guard
Amy Kunich-from nearby Oakland
Catholic, got in on the fun. She loft-
ed a pass just over the fingertips of

the defense, and it bounced right to
a cutting Brooke Stewart who swept
in for a lay—up to give Pitt a 65-51
lead. Stewart finished with 15
points and three assists.
Later Kunich hit a three and hit
a ﬂoater in the lane, to finish with
nine points on top of four assists._
“I was excited at first,” said
Kunich, who also committed six
turnovers in the game. “I tried not_
to think about it too much.” _
Waites was pleased with the
performance of the three freshmen
who played, Kunich, guard Haley
Harguth and center Allisha Morris,
and expects them to get many min-
utes in the rotation this season.
“Amy was a little nervous, but
she know-s what she needs to do,”
Waites said. “I’m really proud of

Haley for stepping in there and get- ,

ting 10 points.” a
Harguth also had an assist and a
steal.
Pitt had its ups and downs in the
second half. At one point it led by
30, but the PWBA went on a 13-3

run to end the game. I
“I think we got a little content,” -

Waites said.

“We thought a lot about running,
but we’ve got to [rebound], too,”
Wittenmyer said.

Overall, though, with six play- A

ers scoring in double figures,
including Bettina Love with 14, and
all but two players clocking more
than 20 minutes, Waites didn’t have
much reason to complain.
“It was" just a lot of fun.”
