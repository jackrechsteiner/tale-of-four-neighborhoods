New sports center brings
additional options to Pitt

SoNYA PATEL
Staff Writer

As fall slowly
approaches and tank tops
and shorts are put away in

the closet, students might

be going to the gym to do
more than just look good.

With a new ‘gym in
Oakland, a few blocks from
the Petersen Events Center,
students have a new place
to go if they want to keep in
shape.

Here on campus, the
Petersen Events Center
caters to students’ needs.

Equipped with every-
thing from cardio machines
and free weights to a food

gym right after c1asses._

“It’s a good way to’

relax,” Darah Richardson, a
Pitt junior who often goes
to the gym to use the bikes
and elliptic machines, said.

In addition to her work-
out, Richardson goes to the
center for some of her
classes this semester,
weight training and person-
al fitness. .

But the new gym in
town, Three Rivers Fitness
& Sports Medicine Center,
has opened its doors to the
Oakland community.

Along with the ameni-
ties present in many fitness
centers, such as treadmills,

Falafel vendors, women in beer

ing ring set the scene. In the middle
of it all sat the two heavyweight
contenders for Allegheny County
chief executive.

Republican office incumbent
Jim Roddey and Democrat chal-
lenger Dan Onorato duked it out in
Market Square last Wednesday, at a
debate organizedby Iron City Pro

p Boxing.

Three panelists fired ten ques-
tions at the candidates, approaching
some of the most popular topic‘s.of
the race thus far: property taxes,
row office consolidation and anti-
terrorism security.

Roddey spokemostly about his
record since taking office in
January 2000. He said that hehad
balanced a county budget that was
$27 million in the red at the end of
1999, while creating roughly
17,500 jobs and increasing the
county’s bondrating. 9

Roddey called Allegheny
County an “island of fiscal respon-
sibility” in Pennsylvania, which
currently holds a $2.5 billion
deficit. ,

He also discussed his post—Se-pt.
11, 2001 measures to protect and
prepare the county.

“We have become the national
model for anti-terrorism,” he said.

County Controller Onorato
detailed his proposed Young Adult
Initiative which would attempt to
increase the county’s severely wan-
ing number of professionals
between the ages of 22 and 44. His
plan would involve young profes-

Conference looks at black consciousness movement

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Staff Writer

Pitt history professor Laurence
Glasco was surprised to learn that
the black consciousness movement
had reached minorities around the
world.

Through his travels on Semester
at Sea, Glasco learned that people
in China, Japan and Northern
Ireland identified with the civil
rights movement in America.

To illustrate this, Glasco spoke
of when he went to China to teach a
one-month African-American histo-
ry course at a minority center.

“Before I went to China, I did-
n’t even know they had minorities
[there],” he said.

To his surprise, Glasco discov-
ered that his students knew all
about Frederick Douglass and the
civil rights movement.

His students identified with
black peop1e’s struggle in America
and looked up to figures like
Douglass and Martin Luther King
Jr.

While lecturing, with the help
of an interpreter, about abolitionist
Frederick Douglass, Glasco noticed
that his students would repeatedly
nod their heads and say, “Just like

China.”

After this happened several
times, Glasco asked them what they
meant. '

They said they saw a similarity
between the way

groups.

Biko, of South Africa, co-
founded the Black Peoples
Convention, which brought together
about 70 other black consciousness

people around the world,” Glasco
said.

While on, Semester at Sea,
Glasco traveled to India, where
there is‘ a group of people called the
Dalits, or the “untouchables.”

“I had assumed that this was

somethingin the past,” Glasco said.
He had expected to find a dimin-
ished legacy of prejudice against
the Dalits, similar to the legacy of

’ slavery in America today.

Instead, the plight of the Dalits
in India was similar to the plight of
blacks in Mississippi 100 years ago,
he said. ,

The Dalits were segregated and
could not enter certain establish-
ments, Glasco said. They were
thought of as lazy and dirty people,
he added.

A Dalit told him how the civil
rights movement inspired them. In
fact, the Dalit militant group is
called the Dalit Panthers, after the
Black Panthers, he said.

“The mind is the most danger-
ous weapon,” Milton Allimadi,
another speaker at the event, said.
“But the mind has to be liberated

first.”

Allimadi added that the “nega-
tive and racist fportrayal” of
Africans in the media undermines
that goal. .

In his book, “The Hearts of

Darkness: How white writers creat-
ed the racist image of Africa,”
Allimadi explores the issue by

sionals in boards under chief execu-
tive jurisdiction.

The two candidates differed pri-
marily on where new jobs, industry
and business should come from in
the county. .

“The great , growth will come

from companies that are already

here,” Roddey said of his plan,
wh~ich.-involved encouraging busi-
nesses in Allegheny .County to
expand their services and take on
more workers. ’ 1

Although the expansion of cur.-
rent businesses formed Roddey’s
primary suggestion for economic
improvement, he also discussed
encouraging entrepreneurs and
attracting foreign investors to move
business to Pittsburgh.

“We need [foreign investors] to
put Pittsburgh on the list,” Roddey
said, after reciting a list of
American cities that have already
caught the eye of foreign business.

Onorato criticized Roddey’s
plan, saying that the major portion
of it, involving the expansion of
present businesses, is simply
“reshufﬂing,” or the rearrangement

_ of business with no actual growth.
. He remained skeptical, continually
- asking the audience to check the

numbers on Roddey’s economic
proficiency as-chief executive.
“We did not 'move*'forw-ar-.d,”

~ Onorato said of Roddey’s term in

office. “We moved backward.”
Onorato said he would use bud-
get dollars to rid the county of
1,500 old industrial sites,’hoping to
encourage growth i_n the private
sector and consequently lower the

unemployment ‘rate.

He said that despite Roddey’s

I talk of job creation, unemployment

has risen 31 percent since the
incumbent took office.

Onorato also promised a 10 per-
cent tax cut, mentioning that
Ro_ddey had failed‘ to follow
through with a similar pledge in

1 1999.

Roddey struck. back,‘ clai_mi_,ng
that between 30,000 and 40,000
jobs were lost during Ono‘rato’s
stint as a city councilman from
1991-1998.

Roddey said that ‘his chal-
1engcr’s pledge to cut expenses,
with no layoffs or losses in service,
was “very naive.” ,

Onorato countered that, four
years ago, Roddey made several of
the same pledges during his cam-
paign —— but failed to act on them

0 Candidates debate business,
  job losses, county growth

while in office.
“The time for debate and analy-

sis is over. It’s time for action,”’

Onorato said. “We’ve got to cut
taxes, and we’ve got to grow the
economy.”

Both candidates agreed that the
county could save millions by rid-
ding itself of row offices, elected
positions that they said could easily
be privatized.

This will be a record-setting
race for Western Pennsylvania in
terms of money spent and debates
held.

The debate at Market Square
was the tenth between the two since-
August, with at least twelve more
scheduled before the election on
Nov. 4.

Each party is expected to drop
$10 million into the campaign
bucket this fall, $4 million of which
will be spent on television commer-
cials alone.

After all, the stakes are high_.

The chief executive is consid-
ered the third most important exec-
utive position in the state of
Pennsylvania.

Roddey has a stronghold.in a

county where democrats outnumber ’

republicans 3—to‘-1.

This means that Senator
Santorum, and even President Bush,
have become very interested in this
race. ‘

.“lt’s definitely going to be
close. I see these guys being neck-
to-neck until the bitter end,” said
Fred Marcus, who munched on a
sandwich as he watched the debate

"during his lunch break. “I’m a

Roddey supporter, but I think
Onorato won this debate, if you’re
going by audience reaction.”

Virginia Harin, aPoint Park stu-
dent, came to the debate for extra
credit in- a political science class.

“I’m glad to be here. This was a
cool way to stageya debate,” she
said.

Harin also mentioned that she
thinks it is important for more col-
lege students to involve themselves
in politics. ,

A mere 3 percent of people

_ between the ages of 18 and 25 vote,

according to the League of Women
Voters, which co-sponsored the
debate. ‘

League representative Carol
Emerson thanked all debate atten-
dees‘with a statement of praise:
“You’ve taken a step to be an active
and informed member of the voting
process. You’re the real winners
today.”

EDITORIAL

Calling for accountability from Bush

According to a new Washington
Post-ABC News poll, six out often
Americans don’t support President
George W. Bush’s request for $87
billion to ‘continue rebuilding Iraq.

Rightly so. 4.

The American people deserve to
know what’s behind this enormous
number — a number representing
their money. '

Setting. any political ideology
aside, it’s simply poor business
practice to requisition funds with-
out itemizing what is needed.

No CEO would go to her board
members without invoices and spe-
cific costs for specific items — not
if she expected to be approved.

Perhaps the amount is justified
— but how would we know?

' No one is providing any
answers, and the lack of transparen-
cy — hiding behind the limp gener-

‘ ality of “security reasons” —— 1s

despicable.
In every high school civics

(class, students learn that the funda-

mental difference between conserv-
atives and liberals is how much of
the taxpayers’ money the govern-
ment should spend,’ and how.
Liberals, we were told, want to"
spend lot-s of money on social pro-
grams and benefit the populace that
way. Conservatives, the teaching
went, want to‘ "streamline govern-

ment and let citizens/keep more of
their own money to spend as they
see fit. Liberals want more govern-
ment; conservatives‘, less.

Yet, in these Republican-domi-
nated times, our government wants
to make a massive grab for our
money in a time when the
domestic financial picture is utterly

bleak ——- without explaining where

they want to spend it.

The Department of Homeland
Security was the first new federal
rdepartment created since the
Department of Defense at the end of
World iWar II —— not exactly a
streamlining move.

Questioning the amount, or sug-
gesting the denial of the request in
today’s paranoid political climate is
sure to draw immature cries of
-“_Terroristl” Bush will get his
money, and some financial experts
are suggesting that theamount will
grow and grow. ,

Regardless of. how any citizen
saw the war — as a necessary hard-
ship or an inexcusable waste of life
— it happened. Now, we have a
responsibility to rebuild Iraq or it
will descend further into anarchy.

’ However, our president has a
responsibility to us, the taxpayers,
to explain how he arrived at the fig-
ure he did, and what, exactly, his
plan is. ‘

There’s just something about accents

_ It’s sort of an unwritten rule that having
any sort of accent — British, Australian, or
Southern, for example — increases a per-
son’s attractiveness about twenty times over.

After an ill—advised e—rr1ail, he’s facinga weird semester

Dear Sex N’ at:

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year
now and the sex has been fantastic. I know
he’s experimented with stuff like bondage
and role-play before -— he’s much more
experienced than me. I’d like to try that stuff
too, but I’ve never done anything like that
before and it’s hard for me to bring up. I’m
kinda shy to begin with, and I’m not too
experienced with sex. Plus, growing up in a
Muslim house didn’t help my sexual devel-
opment at all. I’ ve only been able to be a sex-
ual creature since I came to Pitt. Most people
would say, “Oh, just explore your fantasies.”
But I’ve never really had any of those fan-
tasies! Stuﬂ° like that has always been off-
lirnits in my world. But I want to learn! I’ve
mentioned it to him before and basically

— said, “lead the way.” But so far, nothing. I

ﬁgured he’d open up once I said I was inter-
ested. I guess this is a hard thing for people
to bring up on either side. Like I said, the sex
has been great, so it’s not like I’ve got any-
thing to really complain about, but I think
things could really take off in a way I’ve
never even dreamed about. What do you
think? ’ '

Dear Haifa:
Sounds like you are in a perfect position

to begin expanding your sexual horizons.
You have a healthy sexual curiosity and
someone you trust to explore it with. All you
need are some options.

. Here’s a fun secret All boys like pom.
The idea of looking at porn with the woman
they love, and love to make love to, appeals
to them all, secretly or overtly. So surprise
your man with some videos or magazines
next time you
know you’ll be
alone and enjoy-
ing some of that
fantastic sex. Get

that experience.
Dear Sex ’ 

I was at a party two weekends ago and

ended up hooking up with a girl that I had.

just met in one of my classes. Several prob-
lerns resulted. First, during the sexing itself,

she dug her nails so deep into my back that I
actually bled slightly. I lmew she was being
a little rough while we were going at it, but I
didn’t know how to tell her to stop. Once I
sobered up, the gash marks I had were bor-
derline ridiculous. Second, ever since then,
she’s been awkward with me in class (we
work in a group of ﬁve on different projects.)
And it’s not even that she feels awkward
toward me —— it’s that she thinks I feel awk-
ward toward her. I can’t convince her other-
wise. And third, I got extremely drunk last
Thursday night and tried to call her for a
booty call. Thankfully, she wasn’t home. But
then, after Saturday’s football game, I got
home and, trashed again, e—mailed her an e-
mail that was so dirty I’m«embarrassed to
have «written it —- basically an electronic
booty—call. She hasn’t responded So I’m
wounded, in an awkward situation, and
making it worse every time I get beer in my
system. Any advice? .

Murphy’s innovative budget solutions for Pittsburgh

Hello fellow Pittsburghers, Mayor Tom here. What’s
happened to us? We used to be pals. Now, you’re treating me
like [insert bizarre, mule-related Cleveland joke here].

I’ve been under huge pressure from mayoral candidate
in case of my irnpeachment/local music god Donnie Iris. His
“Platform: Rock!” propaganda has me up to my Prirnanti’s
sandwich in bad PR., and it’s time for me to take a stand
Pittsburgh, I know that, on my watch, the city fell into the
most toilet-like conditions since the ‘70’s, but don’t worry, I
have a plan.

We have exactly zero dollars left in the bank and, since
I’m standing in a phone booth right now with a guy threat-_
ening to shoot me if I raise taxes, my city renaissance will not
cost anyone that matters a dime. I’ve decided to scrap my
“budget cut 0’ the week” strategy and just get it over with and
eliminate all the baby fat programs now. You didn’t really
think we wae done, did you?

Sports ﬁrst, we’re cutting the pierogi race at Pirate base-
ball games (damn you Jalapeno Hannah and your salary
arbitration), and I’m cutting unpopular mascot “Stevie
Steeler” loose. Fans of PennDOT’s ConeMan can visit him
at his new job, the Arby’s on Route 51. City traﬂic lights and
street lamps will now blink on and off, thereby reducing
power needs by _50 percent. And we’re not cleaning any-
thing, ever. »

Now on to the good stuff, the “improvements.” Layoffs
of police officers and the cutback of street sweepings have
been major issues in the past few weeks. Never fear, I have

a single solution to remedy both. Since our city police force
is now only 27 oﬂicers, andtheir primary duty is to close
down the Roberto Clemente Bridge on game days, all citi-
zens of Pittsburgh may ann themselves and enforce the law
on their own terms. .

Citizen’sarrestsmaybemadeandcrimina]smaybe

mandatory for every college student to com-

jailed within unused city Port—A-Johns for up to 90 days.  

for the cleanliness problem, litterers may be shot on sight.
In response to the outcry against reducing public trans-
portation, I am initiating a new sector of the Port Authority,

the “Shoeleather Express.” The city will also purchase two— V
‘dozen Fred Flintstone-style cars to travel the bus routes.

Fares will be slightly reduced

If Pittsburgh ever becomes the nirvana it never was, it
will be because of young people’s involve-
ment, and wild spending habits, in this ﬁne
town. In response to the “aft;er—oollege-exo-
dus” from Pittsburgh, I —- in collaboration
with Pitt, Carnegie Mellon, Robert Morris and
Duquesne universities —— am now making it

plete at least an eight-year undergraduate pro-
gram. California University of Pennsylvania
gave me the idea, considering most of their
undergrads are on the eight-year plan already.
Coincidently, I am also signing into law a
bill that decrees that any person who stays in’ j
Pittsburgh for eight consecutive years must stay here for life.

In conjunction, these two new acts will keep young people

in this town for decades to come, as well as allow universi-
ties to actually skin them alive with tuition increases. We are
currenﬂy in the process of ﬁnding a way to chemically pre-
serve the skin, so it can be sold back to the student and then
taxed.

In order to increase our revenue, we have to increase our
tourist dollar. Because we have no tourism, we’re moving on
to plan B: charging out-of—towners to indulge in our customs.

The new * album from cult

The new direction that Guster

refreshing. It has more -of a swing-

mainly from the addition of the

Highlights of Keep .It

first line is, “Throw away your

“Backyard” is a ‘mellow '
track that sports the bongos

There are more laid back

There’s a Magnetic Fields lyric that pretty much
summarizes the tragedy of the singer—songwriter:

~ “Acoustic Guitar/I could sell you tomorrow/Just

bring me back my gir .” OK, maybe it’s slightly
more complicated than that, but the truth remains
that sad, grown—up men have been taking their emo-
tional turmoil out on their acoustic guitars for quite
some time now. '

There must be something that draws people to
such pure melancholy. Perhaps it’s an acute sense
that the performer is more bummed out than the
audience. More likely, it’s the intimate bond created
among the audience, the performer and that damn
guitar —-— the innate‘ happiness in sharing one’s
despair with others. '

Listen to the acoustic sound of Rice

almost no time and his performances sold out some
of the biggest venues in the country.
Now that Rice’s popularity has officially spilled

‘into North America, more and more people are

becoming enraptured by his intimate songwriting
style and raspy vocals, which have earned him com-
parisons to the likes of Jeff Buckley, Ryan Adams
and even Thom Yorke. ‘ -
Rice’s gig at Club Cafe on Tuesday will be yet

THE PITT NEWS

Remembering Johnny Cash

Cash, page 8

people give thanks to God every
day or say, like Cash does, “Good
Morning.”

But those who believe in God
keep the Chief close, never for-
getting his presence, even if a
“Good Morning” is missed here
and there. Cash’s appreciation of
God isn’t the one that most musi-
cians have, where they’ll look to
the heavens and point, thanking
him for winning whatever latest
award is being doled out.

It’s the kind of appreciation
the normal person, the everyday
man and woman, has. His voice is
the voice of the regular Joe, the
guy working for a living. It’s not
a phony, contrived marketing
ploy; it’s the real deal.

When he says he gives God a
big “Thanks a lot, Chief” for
being able to come home and curl
up with his wife, June Carter, it’s

genuine —' she’s his soul mate.
When he sings about jailhouse
blues, it’s real —— he’s been in
prison.

There was never any phoni-
ness to his music or life, thus it
was contradictory that the video
for “Hurt,” one of the greatest

achievements in the medium,
ever, was played on MTV, a
microcosm of a fake music indus-
try dominated by bubble—gum pop
and the sampled annoyance of
most hip hop.

Now there’s one less person
raising hell in the music industry,
one less person with the backbone
to walk this world with his head
high, knowing he’s living life the
way he wants to be living it.

And I think that’s the lasting

message Johnny Cash has given 

to the world. Do what you love,
be with who you love and live life
with love.

To be able to come home,
after hours at the workplace, feel-
ing frayed, and be able to curl up
next to the only person you can
ever see yourself spending your

life with — that’s one hell of a.

goal to strive for. And if you
reach it, you can say, “Thanks a
lot, Chief” and mean it, even if
you forget to now and then.

No one but Johnny Cash could
have articulated a lifesuch as that
as elegantly as he does in the liner
notes of American IV. And know-
ing that Cash achieved such a life
gives hope that others can achieve
the same.

Men’s soccer falls to No.8 Scarlet Knights,{4—l

JIMMY JOHNSON
For The Pitt News

The men’s soccer team looked
to break their seven—year winless
streak against Big ,East rival
Rutgers, but the -No. 8 Scarlet
Knights (3-1 overall, 2-1 Big East)
poured on the offense, defeating
Pitt (1-4, 1-1) on Sunday, 4-1.

Rutgers applied early‘ pressure
on the Panther defense and contin-
ued it throughout most of the first
half.

With the score knotted at zero,
the Scarlet Knights came up" with
some close calls. "Wes Kirk had an
open window and fired the ball on
net, but Pitt goalkeeper Justin

g Lowery dove to his left tomake the

save. Soon after that, Chris Karcz
had a wide—open shot soar just
above thercrossbar. ,

'.. I r A : * . .
. .¢-mt-...t,..s..u,.._,...... ,....,»-,.-.—-...«.,.....,..., vul
. .. .. r‘ . « . , , . .

Rutgers was the first to get on
the scoreboard when Ricardo
Arenas used his head to deﬂect- a
corner kick from Gustavo Mora at
19:30.

Rutgers struck again when
Karcz came in on net alone and
Lowery came out to challenge him.
Lowery slid and deﬂected the ball,
knocking over Karcz. The ball con-
tinued its path on net, hit the left
post, and then slowly made its way
across the goal line before the clos-
est Panther defender could stop it.

A-fter a couple more close calls,

the Panthers caught a break late in "

the first half when Rutgers goal-
keeper Scott Conway made the
decision to kick the ball out with
Panther forward Billy’Brush closing

.in on him quickly. The kick deﬂect-

ed off of Brush’s leg and went right

, Vintothje net to make the score 2-1.

“The play was set up when Clay

Haflich headed the ball to Keeyan
Young, jvvho alsoheaded the ball
forwardto Brush. Brush moved the
ball downfield and kicked it in on
net, and Conway made the stop for
Rutgers," -
' —The Panthers came out for the
restof‘ the second half, feeding off
themomentum from the goal they
scored late in the second half.

,“I‘f thought we played well for

' the:first’twent.y~rninutes [of the sec-
Joe, .

0nd. half]’’ head coach
Luxbacher remarked after the game.

(The Panthers applied pressure
on the Rutgers defense, but were
unable to get the ball past Conway.

Joe Donoho put the Scarlet.

Knights up 3-1 ‘when he headed the
ball into the net after another corner
kick from Mora.

Soon after that, Rutgers sealed

the victory with a goal from the Big
East scoring leader Josh Gros. Gros
used great footwork to move past

two Panther defenders and create an-

opening to the net. He then shot the
ball towards Lowery, who at first
had made the save before the ball

trickled between his legs and acroddss J

the goal.

The Panthers offensive woes, ’.

continued as they scored only their

fourth goal in five games this sea-

son. g

»“We’re still searching for
“answers,” Luxbacher said. “Offense
is contagious and [a matter of] con-
fidence. [Once] you score one or
tw'o,eyou’ll be playing better. Our
goal is to make the Big East play-
offs.” ,

The Panthers next game will be
at home on Sept. 17 against St.
Francis at 7 p.m.

A push off. That’s not some-

Miree’s three touchdowns lead Pitt to win

Ball State, page 11

and put on the breaks from the first half.”

Two minutes and 25 seconds into the third quarter,
Rutherford delivered a 27-yard completion to senior
Princell Brockenbrough for a touchdown.

“I actually thought they were going to go to Larry
[Fitzgerald] like they always do,” Brockenbrough said.

“Rod threw it perfect and Princell made a big play.
We’ve always thought that he could be a ﬁne football
player,” Harris said. '

With the score then 021-14, Miree continued the

offensive assault in the third quarter with a 5-yard touch-
down run.

VV1th ﬁve minutes and
58 seconds left in the third 3 
quarter, Pitt scored yet
again.

Fitzgerald caught his
second touchdown of the
game and later refuted
claims that he pushed off of
the defender to reel in the
pass. '

“I just went up and
grabbed the ball. I never
thing I work‘ on,”
Fitzgerald said.
“Unfortunately,” he fell
down and I was able to
make the catch? _ r _

"In the ﬁnal quarter, Pitt
and Ball State exchanged
touchdowns to finish the _
game. Miree rushed for his ’ A
career-best third touch-
down of the game, only
four seconds into the quar-
ter. —

Ball State’s Larry
Bostic caught a 3—yard pass
for a touchdown to provide
the ﬁnal points of the

game. ’

Harris remained disappointed with his team, even
though the Panthers were able to double the score of
Ball State. - '

“I feel like I didn’t do a good enough job, because I
expected us to make a big improvement from week one
to week two. And I don’t feel that,-"and I’m responsible
for that,” Harris said. “We’ve got to stop them all the
time. You know, offense is supposed to score all the
time, that’s their job. But it obviously doesn’t happen
every time. ‘

‘‘[Ball State] did a nice job. Give them credit, you

know; some of it’s them, a lot of it’s us, most of it’-s me.”

, JOE MARCHILENA/SPORTS EDITOR

Defensive end Claude Harriott celebrates after making a tackle during
Saturday’s game against Ball State.

Panthers’ running game
may be key to success

Nocks, page 12

Miree finished the afternoon with 73 yards on 15
carries. Rutherford rushed eight times for 47 yards
to go along with his 285 yards passing and three
touchdowns.

The Panthers need to use the trio of Miree,

Polite and Rutherford to their advantage. They .

combined for 189 yards rushing and for 76 of
Rutherford’s 285 passing yards. ’

Pitt was unsuccessful running the ball during
the first half, so the offense struggled. The offen-
sive line struggled during the first half, especially
with penalties.

“I think we came out with a lackiof focus,” A

Miree said. “We prepared well this week for the
things that they were givinggius, but you make a lot
of mental mistakes like that and it’s kind of hard to
startout first and IS.’’ '

If the Panthers’ offensive line fixes their mis- ,

takes, this should allow for Pitt to take advantage
of its running strengths, which will in turn make up

for a nice one—two punch with the combination of 1'

Fitzgerald and the receiving corps.

“Execution with a capital E is the big thing.
The sky’s the limit for this offense,” Miree said.
“It’s so fun to be out there and witness Larry mak-

ing catches, and witness Lou catching the ball and_

running down the field and just running over peo-
ple.” ‘ _

Thankfully for the Panthers, their defense was
able to hang in there and regroup after a disastrous
end tothe first half that saw the Cardinals score 14
unanswered points to knot the game.

The road ahead is tougher and the offense can-
not afford to get into a groove in the second half of

’ games. The better teams are not likely to allow 28

unanswered points in a half.
