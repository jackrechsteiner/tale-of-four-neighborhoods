Bars raided, ofﬁcers cite underagers

‘ROCHELLE HENTGES
Senior Staff Writer

Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement offi-
cers and city and state police raided three
Oakland bars late Thursday night into early
Friday morning.‘

At 11:35 p.m. Thursday, officers performed
an open inspection of Cumpie’s Restaurant and
Lounge. During an -open inspection, officers
reveal their identities, instead of remaining
undercover, and start carding people.

Five underagers were cited for‘ underage
drinking at Cumpie’s, and officers cited two for
possession of fake IDs. John Hupp, an enforce-
ment officer from the Bureau of Liquor Control
Enforcement, did not know if the two people
cited for having fake IDs were also cited for
underage drinking”

One hour later, officers began carding people
at Bootleggers. Five people there were cited for
underage drinking. And at -1:30 a.m. on Friday,
officers cited one underager at Denny’s Bar.

Those cited for underage drinking and pos-
session of a fake ID have to go to court, where a
judge will decide the Offenders’ punishments.

_ ‘ According to Hupp, a typical punishment for
a first-time offender is a fine of about $300 and

a 90-day driver’s license suspension.

The Obars’ owners also have administrative
charges filed against them, Hupp said. Usually,
this results in a $1,000 fine, but owners can also
hav_e their liquor licenses suspended or revoked,
he added. a

Criminal charges can also be'filed, meaning
the owners of the bars could possibly face jail
time, Hupp said. -

He was not aware of any possible criminal

charges faced by Cumpie’s, Bootleggers, Or
Denny’s.

During the summer, officers also raided
Cumpie’s for underage drinking.

Managementat Cumpie’s had no comment.

According to Hupp, there are several differ-
entfactors the Bureau uses when deciding which
establishments it will visit.

“We’re generally complaint-driven,” he said.

When the Bureau uses tips it receives about
bars that serve minors, officers know beforehand
which establishments they are going to raid, and
the raid is typically part of an Ongoing investiga-
tion. 0

But officers sometimes also decide to spon-
taneously perform open inspections if “youthful-
looking’’ people are on the premises, he said.

Hupp said he did. not know which scenario
applied to Thursday night’s raids.

Pitt Project manages to
fill free shirts despite cold

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Two hundred-ﬁfty pizzas, 500 free

T-shirts and “awhole lot” of trash.

These are the things students ate,
wore and picked up, respectively, during
the Pitt Project Oakland last Saturday.
The project, organized by Student
Government Board, ‘Student ’ Volunteer
Outreach and the Oakland Planning and
Development "Corporation, drew more
than 500 students into the ‘streets of
Oakland at 9 a.m. Saturday. -

“It says so much about the students,
on a cold, rainy Saturday morning -—
while Fall Fest was going on — to have
students out there picking up trash,” said
Sam Friedman, the Community
Relations chairperson for SGB. “It was
amazing.”- .

“I really want to thank all the orga-
nizations that registered and came out,”
he added.

Though between 500 and 550 of the

‘approximately 650 students who signed

up to - participate turned out Saturday
morning, Friedman said he had doubts
the project would work out when he '
woke up to inclement weather.

“We started watching" the weather, ’
and the percent chance of rain kept
going up,” Friedman said, describing
the days before the event. .“By Friday, it i
was 80 percent, so we were pretty ner-
vous.” , j _

' Participants might have shared the
same concerns as Friedman. On .
Saturday morning, he received about 10
calls from people who wondered if the
event had been cancelled because of the
rain and cold.

SGB President Liz Culliton also,
thought the weather would deter many
would-be volunteers.

“I really didn’t think anybody’
would be out there,” she said, adding ‘
that students — many from Pitt groups

CAS gets a new name and becomes a school

MICHELLE Scorr
Senior Staff Writer

Soon you may have to retire
your old, gray CAS T-shirt, because
the College of Arts and Sciences is
getting a new name. .

Over the course of the next year,
the College of Arts and Sciences and
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
will be renamed.the School of Arts
and Sciences. John Cooper, dean of
the School of Arts and ‘Sciences,
said that, while this new name is
effective immediately, it will be
implemented gradually over the

“This brings our nomenclature

that, according to conventions in
American Academia, the term

“school” encompasses both graduate» Clan/‘re

word ‘‘college,’’_' on the other hand,

generally applies to undergraduate '

students.

For example, Pitt’s College of

remain the same, this new title will

be simpler and represent their"

shared conviction to support the
humanities.

“I think it expresses the inter-
connection and unity between our
different missions,” Cooper said. He
said that the professors in the
School of Arts and Sciences are
responsible, not only for writing
scholarly articles -and for doing
research, but for teaching under-

graduate students, as well as gradu-

ates.

“All of these activities flow -
from the scholarly expertise of the

faculty,” he said. “This name is
symbolic of that.” .

Cooper mentioned that the con-
fusing division between the FAS and
the CAS was the result of a compli-
cated history of names. According
to the Arts and Sciences Gazette,
Pitt’s first liberal arts programs
were ‘established through the
College of Liberal Arts in 1845. By
the l960s, Pitt’s “academic disci-
plines” had been separatedinto the
School of Liberal Arts, the School
of General Studies, and the divi-

sions of the Social Sciences, Natural I

Sciences, and Humanities.

Why not regulate professional braiders?

The Pennsylvania House

Professional Licensure committee

is considering a bill_ that would
require professional hair braiders to
obtain licenses to practice their art

—-—. much like cosmetologists are’

required to have licenses allowing
them to cut or color hair.

The bill would require less than
300 hours of schooling and an exam
on techniques, sanitationand safe-
ty. Braiders who’ve been working
more than three years would be
granted a temporary, nine-month
license, and would be exempt from
the schooling — they’d be eligible

 for a permanent one simply by tak-

ing the exam.

State Rep.:W. Curtis Thomas,
D—Philadelphia, introduced the bill
-after more than 25 braiders in his
district were fined for operating
,without a cosmetology license. The
braiding license would be specific
to braiding and wouldn’t require

._ training in cutting or coloring hair.

The license, while surely a new
source of paperwork and anxiety, -is
a good idea, and competent braiders

' whotake pridein their work ‘should
welcome it.

While intellectually, everyone
knows that one’s hair is but a cos-
metic concern, no one wants their

look mangled. Sure, it grows back,‘

and it’s only appearance bn the line

\

—— but realistically, these are seri-
ous concerns. When someone goes
to‘ a professional ‘braider, they
expect to look better afterward ‘—
or at least not worse. And the poten-
tial complications of a botched
braid-job are nothing to sneeze at.
An incompetent braider can seri-
ously hurt a customer, or even
cause hair loss. F

Licensing could help prevent
one "of the latest scourges. of
‘American society — frivolous law-
suits. If someone really thinks_they
can sue a restaurant for making
them"fat,~ doesn’t it seem obvious
that somewhere,‘ someone’s going
to sue over bad braids? Licensing
could weed ' out incompetent
braiders.

And skilled practitioners should
embrace regulation, too. Getting rid
of braiders who don’t know what
they are doing will drive business
to artists who are proven to be com-
petent, safe professionals. .

No one is allowed‘ to profes-
sionally cut or color hair without a
license. Heck, you can’t get your
toes prettied up professionally
without a licensing body being
involved somewhere. ' ‘

Braiding is no less an art form
then cutting, coloring or sculpting,
and should be respected and regu-
lated as such.

America keeps finding space for lawsuits

‘Every day, the ‘world makes a little
less sense. First, ‘we had people suing
tobacco companies for misleading adver-
tising. Apparently the black-and-white
warnings about the carcinogenic nature of
cigarette smoke just weren’t clear enough.
Next, we saw the parents who-wanted to
sue video game manufacturers for making
their children violent Then there’s the
problem of Madonna’s continuing popu-
larity, which I don’t think anyone can
rationally explain. '

But in recent months, it seems that
obesity and’ its causes have been all the
rage. A class-action suit was

  

would be comical if not for the fact that so
many people apparently agree with him.
With common sense falling out of style,
Barber’s reasoning has gained supporters.
George Washington -University law
professor John Banzhaf, for example, has
practically made a personal crusade out of
the war on personal responsibility. He was
a pioneer in the ﬁeld of suing tobacco
companies, but now has redirected his ire.
On his Web site, www.banzhaf.net,— he
says that fast food companies mislead the
public by not making their nutritional
information easily available, and further
claims that his multimillion-

 

filed by people who claimed dollar 7 suits are justiﬁed
they didn’t know that burgers because 7 obesity-related

Remembering one of the world’s great thinkers, activists

One of the most inﬂu-
ential intellects and activists
of the 20th century died
Sept. 25. Dr. Edward Said
was a world-renowned
author, activist, and intellec-
tual. He had been a profes-
sor of English and compara-
tive literature at Columbia.
Those lucky enough to
know of this remarkable
man will more than likely
associate him with the ﬁght .

and the West for all us.

Speakerboxxx/T he Love
Below ‘
Outkast

Arista . .
sifirsfnitr

V Whenpeopleask me which genres
of music I like, my response is always,

“altemative rock, classical, avant-garde -

and Outkast.” Outkast is something
special. It has been nearly 10 years
since the release of the group’s debut
a 1 b u m ,
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, and
they are still releasing music that is
both accessible and innovative at the
same time. Outkast has also been able
to attain a substantial level of commer-
cial and critical success since the duo’s
inception, with hits such as “Ms.
Jackson,” “Rosa Parks” and “So Fresh,

‘ So Clean.” This is relatively unheard of

in rap -music, a genre in which achiev-
ing staying power is extremely difficult;

On their new album,
Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Andre
3000 and Big Boi of Outkast each
appear on their own separate disc. Big-
Boi’s Speakerboxxx is the more main-
stream rap album. Although it provides
only one standout radio track, “The
Way You Move,” it maintains a consis-
tent brilliance throughout. The songs

are combinations of bass and funk that

 

are reminiscent of past hits such as “So
Fresh, So Clean” and “B.O.B.”

Andre c 3000’s The Love Below
proves to be the standout disc in this
set, and'it’s the melodies and innovation
that set it apart. Andre touches on gen-
res such as rap, jazz, rock, classical
music and even techno on his disc.
Every track works, because each song
is laced with great vocal melodies. The
Love Below reaches its apex with the
first single, “Hey Ya!,” which is the per-
fect pop-rap song. “Hey Ya!” is com-

. prised of 4 chords, a good beat, a great

melody, and an even better hook.

Listening to each album indepen-
dently begs you to look back at past
albums and question the origin of older
material. Andre 3000 deﬁnitely wrote
the hook to ‘The Whole World,” while
Big Boi obviously had much to do with
“So Fresh, So Clean.”

While these two artists are both
exceptional recording solo, they are
even better together. If there is one
thing missing from The Love Below, it’s
Big Boi, and if there is one thing miss-
ing from Speakerboxxx, it’s Andre
3000: Andre 3000 provides the innova-
tion‘ and experimentation and Big Boi
provides the mainstream rap brilliance.
Let’s hope that Speakerboxxx/I he Love
Below is the farthest that Big Boi and
Andre 3000 ever part from each other.

_trials and tribulations of

Newly wedded
TV is so addictive

   
  
  

MTV has yet another
reality TV "show that is
super.-addictive. The
appropriately titled
“Newlyweds: Nick
and Jessica” follows
Jessica Simpson and
Nick Lachey through the

newly married bliss ,— A
and the whole country
gets to see that it isn’t all
bliss.

are just like you and me,-only with
tons of money. -

What attracted me to “The
Osboumes” was my liking of Ozzy
and his ‘music. I am by no means a
Jessica Simpson, 98 Degrees or Nick
Lachey fan. I initially watched it
because there was nothing else on. But
from that debut episode, I was hooked.

Throughout the first six or seven

episodes of the show, we learned that
' Nick can be a bit tight when it comes

to his wallet —— he rented a U—Ha'ul to
move himself out of his condo and
wondered if $20 an hour was a lot to
pay a maid. For her part, Jessica does-
n’t have a clue when it comes to cook-
ing and cleaning. Nick looksiat — but
doesn’t touch —- other women, and
Jessica’s poop does indeed stink.
When first seeing the episodes, I
found myself wondering if the couple
was going to make it ‘til death do they
part — or if they would part via death
because one caused the death of the
other. And then, with nothing else to
do on a Saturday afternoon, I found
myself watching a marathon of the
series thus far. With some crafty edit-
ing on MTV’s part, they show a lot of
the couple’s arguments. While some
are petty, some are about serious
issues. ,
I wouldn’t mind my husband
doing promotional work for his new
album at the Playboy Mansion, as
Nick did, but I would find myself a lit-
tle leery about sexy women in very lit-
tle clothing gyrating against him dur-

Jessica and

Nick didn’t live togeth-
er prior to tying the
knot, so he wasn’t used
to her sloppiness and
' un-Martha Stewart-like
ways. I can only hope
that when, and if, I
cohabitate with a man
—— before or after nup-
tials —— he will be able
to deal with my messes

 

Similar to what MTV and burnt attempts at
did with “The Osboumes,” A 3t E Edll0T meals.

of bleeps to censor cuss glimpse of producers’ edits
‘ words — “Newlyweds” follows a when it comes to Jessica’s nagging

and complaining. Sure, she may have
said she was cold, hungry, tired and
had cramps while they were camping
in the mountains, but I’m almost posi-
tive it wasn’t in succession. The gripes
were most likely said on separate
occasions. .

Much like I fixed my schedule to
coincide with “The Osbournes,” I now
do the same with “Newlyweds.” If I
miss an episode, I make sure I catch its
rerun before the next week’s airing. I
think my addiction to peering into the
couple’s lives is part envy and part
identiﬁcation with them. Spoiled as I
can be, one day I hope to live in a huge
mansion and be able to jet off to the
Bahamas to spend quality time with
my husband without a care in the
world.

On the other hand, when I think of
the difficulties of the beginnings of a
marriage, I often think of monetary
concerns. .I thought aboutmy mother’s

stories of living with her in—laws until--.

she and my father could afford to be
on their own, and their constant lec-
tures about how “It’s not all it’s
cracked up to be.” . '

I never thought about getting to
know someone on a whole other level,
of balancing careers and time together,
or about the tiny things that come with
tying the knot — keeping the sex life
interesting, or making not just the big
decisions together, but the seemingly
minute ones as well.

That whole bathroom—odor thing,
though, I’m going to have to take all
sorts of precautions to avoid.

Displacement — it’s something
We’ve all felt. The first semester at
college, the first date with someone
new after a long relationship has
ended, the first day at a new job —
each experience is ridden with the
overwhelming emotion resulting from
being separated from what is going on
around you.

In her book “Speed-Walk and
Other Stories,” Suzanne Greenberg
takes that idea of displacement and
bases all of her stories around charac-
ters who have ended up somewhere
they don’t recognize. Each protagonist
is trying to understand his or her sur-
roundings and make a definite step
forward. A

In the title story, a man finds him-
self in Southern California, the con-
fused owner of a guide dog and a par-
ticipant in “speed walk dating,”. all the

death of his wife two months earlier.

“My Treat, Geronimo” tells the
charming story of a grandmother who

lack any discernible focus. A reader
could close the book after reading, for '

a grandmother’s short visit with her
granddaughter, and not really be any

However, Greenberg, an associate

the lives they’re living. In the title

Sir Laugh-A—Lot shouldbe this man’s new moniker

Daddy’s Home

Sir Mix-A-Lot

Rhyme Cartel Records

1/2 .
Reccomended if you like: To
laugh

Back in 1992, one man brought a
woman’s posterior to the attention of mil-
lions of music consumers. He single-hand-
edly started a craze over a woman who was
“packing much back.” He liked big butts
and he could not lie. The one and only Sir
Mix-A-Lot is back with a new album,

Daddy’s Home. Although many have

chalked the rapper up as a one-hit wonder,
he is still out there trying to get his music
heard and recognized. .

For Daddy is Home, Sir Mix-A-Lot has

ditched his signature bubble-gum rap for

something a little bit more melodic. He still
raps, but now there are women singing in
the background of all of his songs. One
almost wants Mix-A-Lot’s lackluster rap-
ping to continue through the chorus to
spare your ears from the whining the
women are doing during the chorus. On
the title track, the girls sing, “My daddy’s
home,” to which Mix-A-Lot adds, “And
I’m collecting on the rent.” It’s hard to lis-

ten to the albuin as if it isn’t a comedic

effort. VV1th song titles like “Big Johnson”
and ‘Till Da Sun Cums Up,” you haveto
wonder what Mix-A-Lot was thinking.

“Big Johnson” starts oﬁ" with Mix-A-
Lot saying, “You’ve been telling some lies
about your penal region,” to which the
women sing, “We like a great, big john-
son.” He then goes on to discuss the sizes
of men’s genitals. If you are looking for
quality comedy, “Big Johnson” is the place
to ﬁnd it, though one carmot be sure that it
is intentional.

As far as the beats go, the album.
sounds like something that could be pro- -

duced on a kiddie-toy keyboard, with its
little tings and bumps. The music is uno-

riginal and has been done countless times
before. It’s less than mediocre and it could
possibly make you feel less educated for
actually sitting down and listening to it. It
is produced poorly and entirely over-engi-
neered.

Daddy ’s Home is good for a laugh, and
that’s about it. If it was Sir Mix—A-Lot’s
desire to tickle the listeners funny bone, he
did a greatjob. Ifhe was trying to create a
work of art, which most musicians try to
do, he failed miserably. So if you are ever
feeling down and you need to laugh, listen
to Daddy’s Home. You’ll get a kick out of
it

A Beautiful Glow 

The Rock and Roll Worship
Circus ' A -
Media Collective

i‘nik1/2

Drenched in religion‘ and over-
ﬂowing with faith, the Rock and Roll
Worship Circus takes over your
eardrums with an infusion of sound.
In their album booklet is a psalm, Bible
verse or explanation for the purpose of
each song. The amount of praise is
overwhelming at first because every
song is immersed in Bible references
and worship. Though one may not
agree with the beliefs of the Rock and
Roll Worship Circus, it’s important to
respect their powerful lyrics and strong

musicianship. Each song is solid, with.

instruments mirroring what the lyrics

Every song has a different feeling.
The Circus goes from sounding remi-
niscent of the Beatles in “Morning
Glory,” to being eerily similar to Pink
Floyd when original front man Syd
Barrett had the reigns.

“Blessed Tune” is slow and subtle,
afﬁrmedand sure. It’s an ode to Jesus
and the blessings the Circus believes

he bestowed on them. The lyrics are
deep, faithful and more like a prayer
than a song. Lead singer Gabriel
Wilson sings, “Blessed is he who
comes to the feet of the king, washed
by the blood of the son/Oh, who are we
to kneel before you and sing glory, hal-
lelujah.” The song is extremely well
arranged.

The polar opposite of _“Blessed
Tune” is “Gift of Cool.” The song talks
about all the different people who pray
to Jesus, using lyrics such as “Kids
kneeling at the altar with their different
fashion ﬂavors/You had squares, preps,
skater punks/Goths and techno ravers.”
The Circus is showing the different
people -who pray and, at the same time,

. the desire to have their music appreci-

ated by all of the groups listed. The
songs are so fast-paced that Wilsonis

. almost rapping throughout them.

A Beautiful Glow is, overall, a tight
album, free of any dissonance that
would make it unpleasant to the ears.
Though it’s doubtful that the Rock and
Roll Worship Circus will gain a lot of
mainstream success, it’s a strong and
soulful album. Whether you share their
beliefs or not, here’s to a wonderful
album. . .

out twice at home

JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

Just as Pitt’s women’s

soccer team seemed to be

getting used to life on the
road, it returned home in
disappointing fashion. The

» Panthers, coming off con-

secutive victories against
Georgetown and Duquesne
to Wrap up their six-game
road trip, were shut out
twice over the weekend --
1-0 by Miami and 3-0 by

‘Connecticut. Pitt has

scored just six goals in
their last eight games.

Miami 1, Pitt 0

I-t felt more like
January than early October
when the Panthers (4-6-1
Overall, 1-2 Big East) took
on Miami Friday night at
Founders Field. ‘ The
Hurricanes controlled the
bulk of the early minutes
of the game, although they
never really threatened Pitt
goalkeeper Jamie Pelusi.

Pitt had the first scor-
ing opportunity, midway
through the half. Forward
Erin Hills took the ball
down the right sideline and
passed off to Sara Gutting.
Gutting, also a forward, set
up midfielder Corina
Sebesta for a shot that was
blocked by a Miami
defender. Hills raced back
into the play to gather the
rebound but her shot sailed
over the Miami goal.

Pitt had another oppor-
tunity in the 38th minute
of the half but forward
Cara _Senger’s header mis-
fired I and the game
remained scoreless at half-
time.

Miami (7-5 Overall, 1-
1 Big East) came out
strong in the second half.
The Hurricanes had two
quick shotswturned away by
Pelusi, but were finally
able to crack the score-
board in the 51st minute,
when Lindsey Yach took a

‘pass from Ashley Durkee
and scored on a 1eft—footer.

Pitt head coach Sue-
Moy Chin blamed Pitt’s

‘poor second-half start on

adjustments made by
Miami.

“They switched forma-
tions at halftime,” Chin
said after the game. Chin
added that the switch con-
fused the Panthers, and
Miami was able to capital-
ize and score the game’s
lone"goa1.

UConn 3, Pitt 0

UConn came into town
on Sunday afternoon try-
ing to win its third game of
a four-game road trip.

Thanks in large part to
forward Kristen Graczyk,
who scored twice, the
Huskies defeated the
Panthers.

Graczyk’s first goal
came in the 23rd minute.

Pitt looks for first win versus Notre Dame since 1999

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team has the
chance to avenge two consecutive
losses suffered at the hands of the
Fighting Irish, and really look for-

’ ward to; playing -in front of a sellout

crowd at Heinz Field. .
Although the Panthers have

‘come up short against the Irish in

each of the past two seasons, the
games have been tight 9

“Really, the last two years, we
feel like we’ve found a way to lose

. the game, and they’ve found a way

to win the game,” Harris said.

Notre Dame’s offense hasstruggled
so far this”, season, averaging less
than two touchdowns per game; But
the Irish saw a silver lining‘ in their
loss at Purdue. Freshman’ quarter-
back Brady Quinn completed. 29 of

59"passes for 297 yards and one
touchdown,

“I was impressed with their
quarterback, Brady Quinn,” Harris
said. “We‘recruited him. We thought
he was good enough to offer a schol-
arship, so obviously we think he’s an
outstanding player.”

This week the Panthers are,mak—
ing avpersonnel change of their own,
opting to start Willi-am “Tutu”
Ferguson at cornerback in place of
Bernard “Josh” Lay.

“Wethink Josh can play better,”
Harris said.‘ “And we’re expecting
him to. ‘It doesn’t mean Josh won’t

play. It just means that we’re starting ,
P Tutu-and _we’re hoping that he per-—

forms at the level that we want him
to.” ‘ T

, Another Panther fighting for
more playing time is sophomore tail-

game starting in place of the injured
Brandon Miree against Texas A&M.

“I think there’s no question that
he deserves more playing time,”
Harris said. “The problem is [that]
we have another good football play-'
er who is the starter.”

One player who will not be con-
cerned about playing time is quarter-
back Rod Rutherford, whose name
has been mentioned as a Heisman
Trophy candidate. Rutherford’s
comfort and poise has led to spectac-
ular offensive numbers. 9

“Its always nice to have an expe-
rienced quarterback,” Harris said.
“Hopefully we’ll continue to execute
well, and hopefully the coaching
staff will continue to give Rod
[Rutherford] the opportunity to be
successful.” ' ’

The Notre Dame defense should
prove to be another test for

_~ ;.:_';:‘:..:.:.:  ._ ....-.....~~.---»~n --.~—~,~'--«A -- --,-- - ‘ . ’-._...A~~ --—,, E, ‘---

Rutherford and the offense. The

Irish defense has allowed 24 points
or more only once this season, and
Harris feels that their defense is the
biggest strength of the team.

“I think [Notre Dame] is one of
the best defenses that we’ll face all
year,” Harris said.

The Panthers will be playing in
front of a national audience this
Saturday on ESPN. The last time Pitt
beat Notre Dame was a 37-27 victo-
ry back on Nov. 13, 1999, the last
game at Pitt Stadium.

Despite ‘the Irish not being
nationally ranked, coach Harris still
feels like a victory would certainly
make a statement.

‘_‘Any time you beat a storied
program like Notre Dame, I think

’that would be a heck of a compli-

ment to your football team,” Harris
said.

Chicago and Boston fans have no reason to complain

Major League Baseball’s play-
offs have been going on for a week
now, and unthinkably, the Chicago
Cubs and Boston Red Sox are still
lacing on their cleats.

I say unthinkably, because until
Sunday, the Cubs hadn’t won a
postseason series since 1908, and
the Red Sox haven’t won a World
Series since the end of World War I.

As of Monday afternoon, those
same Cubs were preparing to take
on the Florida Marlins in the
National League Championship
Series, and the Red Sox had won
two in a row to extend their series
with the Oakland A’s to a decisive
Game 5 in the American League
divisional playoff. ‘

The Red Sox and Cubs are the
archetypal lovable losers, and the
American sporting culture loves an
underdog. Not many fans garner
national respect on a level that Sox
and Cubbies fans do. Every year,
they flock to Wrigley Field and
Fenway Park, hoping that “this will
be the season,” grumbling about
past tribulations. They’re like a lit-
tle kid who keeps getting beaten up
by a bully, but still refuses to give
up his lunch money, despite endless
failure at hanging on to it. 

The devotion of Chicagoans and

 

Bostonians to their respective base-
ball franchises is admirable, but
they’re not the lovable losers that
the media likes to portray them as,
and they don’t deserve all of the
sympathetic “better luck next
times” the sporting culture dishes
out.

True urban sports fans root for
all of their professional teams and
focus on all of their respective suc-
cesses and failures. Take a close
look at Chicago’s and Boston’s pro
sports franchises over the last two
decades, and you’ll see that the suc-
cesses far outweigh the failures.

The Cubs haven’t been good in
,a long time, but that didn’t matter in
1985, when Mike Ditka and Buddy
Ryan assembled one of the greatest
football teams in history and lost
only one_ game en route to a Super

Bowl championship. That Bears
team also featured one of the great-
est running backs to ever play foot-
ball, the late Walter Payton.

And while we’re talking about
great Chicago athletes, remember
that Michael Jordan guy‘? Chicago
fans certainly do, as Jordan led the
Bulls to six NBA championships in
the ‘90s and established himself as
an international icon.

Boston fans lay a slightly more
legitimate claim to lovable loser
status," but that claim is severely
weakened by the fact that Larry
Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert
Parish led the Celtics to NBA titles

in 1981 and‘ 1986. And whilethati

was" a long time ago, let’s not forget
that the New England Patriots
shocked the world when they beat
the St. Louis Rams to win the Super
Bowl in Feb. 2002.

Allow me to ﬂip the script for a
second, and review what it’s like to
be a Pittsburgh sports fan, particu-
larly a young one. I’m 21 years old,
and my life as a pro sports fan has
been tantamount to slow, excruciat-
ing torture. .

I’ve heard about the greatness
of Jack Lambert and Terry
Bradshaw, but I never got to see
either one of them play. What I did

get was Louis Lipps, Bubby Brister,
and ten years of near-misses under
Bill Cowher.

My dad has told me stories
about Willie Stargell and Roberto
Clemente,_but I am too young to
remember either one of them.
Luckily for me, I’m not too young
to remember Sid Bream sliding into
home plate, Barry. Bonds skipping
town, and te.n years of trade—dead-
line fire sales.

Then there are the Penguins. I
do have fond memories of their
Stanley Cup victories in 1991 and
1992, but I was probably‘ more
interested in the Ninja‘Turtles at the
time. And  can’t shake this awful
feeling that, despite Super Mario’s
best efforts, the Pens won’t be
around anymore in a couple of
years. . _
The most gut—wrenching aspect
of Pittsburgh fandom is I the
‘Burgh’s unbelievable amount of
success on the road to ultimate fail-
ure: three AFC Championship loss-
es and one Super Bowl blunder for
the Steelers in the last decade, two
Eastern Conference Finals losses
for the Pens in the last eight years,
and “two NLCS losses for the
Buccos in the ‘90s. Hell, it’s much
more comforting to at least know

McGrane is considered special player at Pitt

MATT SoRT1No
Staff Writer

When the Pitt Panthers women’s
volleyball team takes the court for a
match, sophomore libero Megan
McGrane wears a different color jer-
sey than the rest of the team.

She swears it isn’t because she’s
special. McGrane was senior class
president in high school and spent
three years on the National Honor
Society. McGrane was on teams that
were state champions in Volleyball
and the State. Runner—Up, in Tennis.
And that was just inshigh school.

In her freshman year at Pitt,
McGrane, a Muncie, Ind. native, was
the only Panther to see action in all
105 games. She broke the school
record for digs in a season, totaling
495, which was good enough to place
first in the Big East Conference.

Now in her sophomore year,
McGrane has helped the Panthers to a
very strong start, which has included
a five—game winning streak while
leading the country in digs, with over
six digs per contest.

“She’s the best libero in the coun~
try right now, if you break it down by
numbers, and I believe [she is the

best player] in general,” head coach
Chris Beerman said. “When you have
something that is the best, you tend to
rely on it.” t

McGrane has enjoyed her success
but hasn’t let personal statistics or
accolades get in the way of what she
wants for the team.

“It’s a team game, and that’s what
I am here to do. My ultimate goal is
to win the Big East [Conference] and
win the Big East Tournament,”
McGrane said.

After the Panthers went 16-9
