Arts & Sciences faculty okay curriculum changes

 . T7‘ eneral education require-
'_  ments for students enter-
ing the College of Arts
and Sciences in fall 2002 will
be clearer and less cumbersome
than the CAS curriculum that
has remained in place, with only
minor changes, since 1981.

Arts and sciences faculty
approved the new undergraduate
curriculum during an April 19
meeting in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

An overwhelming majority
of the 125 or so arts and sciences
faculty in attendance stood to
indicate they approved of the

new undergraduate curriculum. -

When arts and sciences Dean N.
John Cooper then asked faculty
opposed to the curriculum to
stand, only about a dozen people
did so.

The vote capped 30 months
of document drafting, memo
writing, public hearings and
sometimes-contentious discus-
sion of just which courses are
essential to a liberal arts educa-
tion. (About two-thirds of the
Pittsburgh campus’s 15,367 full-
and part-time undergrads last
fall were enrolled in CAS.)

Not everyone liked the new,
streamlined requirements, even
after CAS’s curriculum review
committee dropped its most
controversial proposal: reducing

K  ;l1e College of Arts
  and Sciences’ new gen-
 eral education require-
ments include: an introduc-
tory composition course; two
w_riting—intensive courses; a
quantitative and formal reason-
ing requirement; one course
each in literature, the arts and
philosophy; a second. course in
literature, the arts or creative
expression; a sequence of two
foreign language courses; three
foreign culture/intemational
courses; a non—Western culture
requirement; one course each
in historical change an_d social
science, and three natural
sciences courses.
Besides approving new
general education require-
ments, arts and sciences faculty
voted overwhelmingly April
19 to approve general state-
ments, curricular initiatives
and administrative changes
in connection with the new
curriculum —— but not before

professors criticized some state-
ments (and rejected a few) as
beingvague or potentially threat-
ening to faculty interests. ‘

Political science professor
Jonathan Harris, whose academic
specialties include the former
Soviet Union, attacked one
statement by declaring: "‘I study
Stalinist documents for a living,
and this looks like a Stalinist
document.” ’

The statement in question,
which faculty ultimately rejected
by a 79-46 vote, would have
called for the associate dean for
Undergraduate Studies to work
with CAS Council “to develop,
for the review of the FAS faculty,

* qualitative guidelines that respect

the prerogatives of individual
faculty but establish uniform
expectations with regard to the
intellectual growth that can be

reasonably expected of students.”

in courses at various levels and
how that should be recognized
through the grades awarded.”

Under one new curricular
initiative, arts and sciences
departments will be urged,
but not required, to develop
courses that address diversity
issues such as race, gender,
sexual orientation and reli-
gious differences. .

A few professors suggested
that diversity courses should
be required. But English
professorjean Ferguson-Carr
said she and other members of
the curriculum review com-
mittee were “very unwilling”
to require departments to
develop diversity courses.
Not only would that have
mandated 60 new arts and
sciences courses, Ferguson-
Carr pointed out, but com-
mittee members believed that
students should be encour-
aged to select diversity courses,
rather than seeing them as
yet another hurdle they must
jump.

from three to two the required
number of natural sciences
courses.

.Among those who spoke
against the new requirements
were political science professor
Ronald H. Linden and chemistry
professor David H. Waldeck.
They argued that the new cur-

riculum will marginalize the
social sciences by no longer
requiring students to take a public
policy course while continuing
to require just one course in the
social sciences. Such a move is
unwise “at a time of extraordinary
political complexity at home

and abroad,” said Linden. Many

students’ naive reactions to the
Sept. 11 attacks underlined the
need for more social science
education, not less, he said.
Discussions of eight proposed
amendments to the general
education requirements grew

esoteric at times — for example, .
when faculty debated whether

students should be required to
take “a course in music or art”

V (original wording) or “a course

in the arts,” as theatre arts
professor Bruce McConachie’s
amendment proposed.

The difference: Under
McConachie’s amendment, “the
arts” could include theatre arts,
whereas “music or art” excluded
theatre arts.

In arguing against the amend-
ment, music professor Bell Yung
maintained that theatre deals
mainly with verbal or literary
texts, whereas music and visual
arts primarily employ non-verbal
expression. Therefore, Yung
argued, theatre arts courses
should be grouped with litera-
ture, rather than arts, courses.

Theatre arts chairperson
Attilio Favorini disagreed. “With
all due respect to my colleagues
from music,” he replied, “we
believe in the theatre that [our
work] is not primarily with
words. The basic building block,
the unit of theatre, is the act,
philosophically speaking. It is
not the word. VVhen words occur
in the theatre, they occur as
acts.”

Most faculty showed they
agreed with Favorini’s words
by acting to vote for the amend-
ment.

To the editor:

I would like to write a thank
you letter, as I am leaving the
University of Pittsburgh on
May 3. 1 .

As I leave the University to
embark on a new position, I
wanted to thank some of the
people I have worked with and
for throughout my 14-year career
here. Many of these individuals I
have great respect for and many
have taken the time to teach and
mentor me in my career. From
the red ink of revised memos,
balancing the Indirect Cost
pool, or just bouncing ideas and
frustrations off each other, I have
learned a great deal. -

I want to thank the following:
Jim Borowski, Art Luba, Bill
Laird, Sharon Sobol, Kathy
Sidorovich, the GSPH adminis-
trators (Edi, Eileen T.,- Tina,
Linda, Robin, Matt, Barb, Mary,

Michele, Elly and Arlene),

Dr. Herbert Rosenkranz, Dr.
Edmund Ricci, Dr. Edgar
Duncan and Dr. Kevin Keams
(for telling me to stay in grad

school). These are the people
from whom I have learned and
who have impacted my career at
Pitt. I have learned a great deal
from each of you, and what I
have learned will always be with
me. For those I have failed to
mention, I apologize; it is not
with intent that I forget, but
that list would take many, many
pages.

Also I wanted to thank this
University for giving me the
opportunity to complete an
undergraduate (College of Gen-
eral. Studies) and a graduate
degree (Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs)
and develop a profession as

an administrator. I have truly

fond memories from my time
spent here and want to wish
the University my sincere best

wishes.

Pitt re-names March holiday

here’ll be no more com-
plaints at Pitt about hon‘-
oring “great Americans”
with a holiday in March. The
University ofﬁciallyhas renamed

its day off during spring recess,
3 Spring Holiday. . P '

Elizabeth Baranger, vice pro-
vost for Graduate Studies, said
the name change is permanent.

“The holiday will still be the ’/

Friday during spring recess,”
she said. Spring break" falls each
year in March.

Baranger chairs the Provost’s

. academic calendar committee.

Barbara Mowery, president
of the Staff Association Council
(SAC) and SAC’s representative
on the Provost’s academic cal-
endar committee, said that staff
supported the name-change.
“We felt that the most important
thing was that the University

kept the holiday on the calendar, V

whatever it is called.”
Pitt used to celebrate Pres-

idents’ Day, the traditional
-national holiday, in February.
The University moved that
holiday to a Friday in February
to avoid losing class time on «two
Mondays (counting ]anuary’s
Martin Luther King Jr. Day) in
the spring term. .

‘ The holiday later was

» “renamed Great Americans’ Day

and was ‘moved to Friday of

. Pitt’s spring break week when no

classes are scheduled.

The more generic Spring
Holiday was in response to
campus community complaints

that Great Americans’ Day did .

not accurately describe the
holiday, Mowery said. _
There are no other signiﬁcant
changes to the academic calendar,
Baranger said, other than updat-
ing dates for the coming terms.
Faculty and staff will receive
copies of the new academic
calendar this month, she added.

th utility bills run-

ning more than $14

million a year on the

Pittsburgh campus, Pitt is getting

serious about its comprehensive

energy plans, according to the

associate vice chancellor for
Facilities Management.

Citing what she referred to
as “the intricacies of energy
management,” Ana Guzman
reported last month on a multi-
pronged approach to copingwith
rising costs and implementing
more efficient consumption of
energy campus—wide.

“We deﬁnitely look at energy
conservation in projects and
energy issues from the incep-
tion of all projects, as we’ve
always done,” Guzman told
the University Senate’s plant
utilization and planning (PUP)
committee April 24. “But now
we’re, concentrating more ‘on
where we’re going and what
we see coming up. Thereare
‘green’ issues that won’t cost
more money, and there are
other green issues that are more
expensive and don’t have any
short—term payback.”

For example, she said, replac-
ing every lighting ﬁxture on
campus with a more energy
efficient fixture is not cost-
effective, even though it would
save some energy, she said. 1

Among the energy-related
variables Facilities Management
considers are cost—recovery
investment strategies, the vola-
tility in energy pricing, de-

regulation of certain utilities, 1

consumer usage trends and new
metering technology, Guzman

.~said~   2 - 
"  a “r1il'e‘”of thumb, the"

University uses a 3-5 —y_ear cost-
recovery investment strategy for
utility—related projects, Guzman
said.

Facilities Management

’ engaged the consulting ﬁrm

of Wiley 8: Wilson from Vir-
ginia to conduct a survey of
all Pittsburgh—ca-mpus-buildings
and make recommendations to
Pitt’s administration on utility-
related projects based on the
fastest return of investment.
According to Robert Pack,
vice provost for academic plan-
ning and resources management,

[who attended the PUP commit-

tee 'me__eting, Pitt has a $6 mil-
lion. line item in its annual
capital budget to address recom-
mendations of this kind. “The
University has priority projects
that are detailed each year in the
capital budget,” Pack said.
“Every investment decision
has a budget-payback factor. The

$6 ‘million is for new systems

I and the kind of infrastructure

projects where the return is
quick enough.”

Guzman said that Pitt’s gen-
eral energy strategies are:

Facilities Management is

. working with Computer Services

and Systems Development to
launch a campus—wide informa-
tion campaign on what individu-
als can do to reduce consump-
tion intheir workplace. “We’re
hoping to get the campaign
seriously in place by September,"

to educate people on how they V

can save energy, particularly
in the way they operate their
computers and in buying energy-
saving computers.”

harder look at a big-ticket item

mechanical systems.
Guzman said that in the last

. few years Pitt has replaced 12

aging water chillers with more
efﬁcient and environmentally
friendly ones, including a large
chilled water system at the
Petersen Events Center.

“This allowed us to centralize
our chilled water capabilities,”
Guzman said. “Now we have

reliability and ﬂexibility in the

distribution on our campus. '

For our research facilities, you
have to have [a back—up system]
available, and we can do that
now withiour two large chilled
water plants,” at the Petersen
Center and Posvar Hall.

efficiently. ‘

“The key here is our energy

' management. system,” Guzman
reported. “It is a computerized, .

system that connects our
mechanical systems and allows
us to control these systems from
a central computer.” About .a
third of Pitt’s Oakland buildings
are on—line so far, she said.’

0 Purchase energy competi-
tively.

Guzman said Facilities Man-
agement purchases electricity
and natural gas competitively,
but can be more sophisticated in
the bidding process. ’

“For example, depending
on whether it’s day or night
[usage], you purchase electricity

— at different costs,” she said. “The
ﬁrst thing we need to know is

' how much, when and where we

use our electricity. We’re in the
process of installing systems that
tell us that.” I
Pittrecentlyinstalled measur-
ing devices in 18 Pittsburgh
campus buildings and now is
working on 14 more buildings.

About 59 percent of Pitt’s
$14 million annual utility bill
is for electricity and chilled
water.“ (Pitt uses electric water
chillers.) Steam costs account
for 22 percent; water and sewage
15 pefcent, and natural gas 4
percent of the total.

substations. As one of the largest
purchasers of electricity in the
city, Pitt gets an industrial rate,
which she said is considerably
lower than purchasing electricity
by the building.

John Schenk, senior manager
of energy systems and manage-
ment, told the PUP committee
that Pitt is developing a compre-
hensive electricity consumption
proﬁle. “We’ll. have electronic
metering on all our incoming
lines, so we can read this and say
exactly what’s happening right
now,” Schenk said. “It’s a piece
of information that you need in
competitively bidding electricity.
Right now, I can’t even give them
a proﬁle of what our consump-
tion is. I can tell them we’re
going to be using X-number of
kilowatts a year, but I can’t tell
them where, say, 10 kilowatts of
that is needed all the time.”

dividends. “We’ve seen usage in

purchases the steam for heating
most campus buildings from the_
Belleﬁeld Boiler Plant, located
in Panther Hollow. Pitt owns
45 percent interest in the coal-
burning plant, but pays for its
steam consumption.

“Right now, we’re looking
at expanding the capacity of
the plant [as one option],”
Guzman said. But the expense
of transporting coal by railroad
and barge and the tightening’ of
federal emissions standards may
move the University to purchase
more natural-gas—producing heat
systems on campus, she said.
“Over the next 5 -10 years our
planners will be looking into
the issue of burning natural gas
versus coal as a way of saving
overall costs.” .

Rugh said that Pitt’s natural
gas consumption is relatively low

compared to other utilities. Pitt ,

has gas lines from both Equitable
Gas Co. and Dominion People’s
company across the Pittsburgh
campus. “Thenatural gas market
has been de-regulated for some

time. So we make them bid

against each other, and use
market forces to our advantage,”
she said.

Regarding water and sewage

‘costs, the University must pur-

chase the utility from the Pitts-

, burgh Water and Sewage Author-

lty.
“Unfortunately, whatever the

cost of the water is, there’s not

much choice in the purchase
of water. We pay the rate the
authority gives us,” Guzman
said.

But, she "said, the cost of

not all go back to the sewer. We’re
now measuring the amount of
water that evaporates, so we do
not pay for that. This shows the

_ kind of sophistication that we’re

starting to get into for energy
savings.” .

Guzman acknowledged that
Pitt’s overall energy plans are not
aimed at savinga specific amount
of energy or money.

“We can’t really do that,
because we don’t know what’s
coming next,” she said. “We
need to ﬁnd out trends. We’re
going to know more when we
ﬁnd out our consumption, which
buildings use the most energy and
so on, usingtheverysophisticated

“The -issue for us is that-
energy, especially electricity, is
an integral part of the running
of the University,” Guzman said.
“That won’t change, especially
as we rely more on computers.
Our role is to see that energy

‘ is available and reliable and

purchased at the lowest cost, so
that research can be conducted
and education can take place at
the University.”

Roy Watters can open it

o safe is safe from Roy
Watters, as he proved

again last month.
Watters, a master machinist
whose fulltime job for 22 years
has been making scientiﬁc instru-
ments for Pitt’s chemistry depart-
ment,'was named the second-
fastest safecracker in the world
during a contest at the Safe and

Vault Technicians Association.

convemion in Reno, "Nev."

The zénmilal cor‘?/)etitio)11 pit:
experts suc as atters an
novice safecrackers against ran-
domly selected safes with combi-
nation locks. No drills, explosives
or listening devices are allowed.
Competitors rely on “manipula-
tion” —- safecrackers’ lingo for
opening a lock without knowing
the combination, by detecting
subtle clicks, bumps and changes
in tension as slip—clutches catch
and wheels line up in grooves.

Competing against a clock,
safecrackers in the expert division
had to open two consecutive
locks. “I had the fastest time, 42
minutes, for one lock,” Watters
says. “The other safe. had a
so-called ‘impossible’ lock. Its
design was perfect -— almost.
I opened it in an hour and 45
minutes.” _

Watters took third place ‘in
the 1990 and 1996 contests.

The competition results

didn’t surprise Pittsburghers
familiar with Watters’s work.
“Roy is the only guy I know who
can open anyt/n'ngup,” says Larry
Sheets, operations manager for
Ace‘ Lock security specialists in
East Liberty. “He’s very, very
good, and has done some amaz-
ing things overthe years.”

Such as the time, in 1993, that '

Watters astonished Pittsburgh
police by opening a damaged safe
they had recovered in Lincoln
Place. The safe’s combination
dial and handle had been broken
off and its hinges mangled. Police
special services personnel and
city medics attacked the safe
with saws and prying tools, to
no avail. Police consulted a local
locksmith, who estimated it
could take hours to drill through
the heavy manganese steel.
After reading a newspaper

story about the safe, Watters
volunteered to open it for free,
partly to help publicize his busi-
ness, Watters Safe & Lock, and
partly for the challenge.

Some challenge. A police
commander who saw Watters

work later told 'a reporter: “It.

took me more time to see if we
had a contract or an obligation
to use a particular locksmith

than-"=‘it‘ took hirii“tor’_’open the '

safe.” Police found $1,100 in
cash inside the safe and returned

the money to its rightful owners,

the Veterans of Foreign Wars
in Duquesne.

“Keep in mind, I’ve been
doing this since 1977,” Watters
says today, with a chuckle. “I
must have learned something in
all that time.”

Cl
An engaging 49-year-old,

'Watters is as quick to laugh as

he is to shift from modesty to
matter-of-fact boastfulness.

“I’ve opened the meanest,
toughest safes and vaults known
to man,” he says in response to
the question: Is there any bank,
university or private safe that
can stop him?

“Any safe that goes down
here in Pittsburgh, I’m the top
dog.”

Watters works on safes during
evenings and weekends. Many
of his customers are jewelry
stores, supermarkets and fast-
food restaurants that neglect
their safes until, one day, they

' no longer open.

“Safes are like cars,” Watters

explains. “VVhat would happen if .

you kept drivingyour car without
ever replacing the oil or ﬁlters or
taking it in for inspection?
“Most banks have mainte-
nance programs for their vaults
and locks. A technician will come
in and clean them once a year,
at least. There are banks in this
area whose vaults are more than
a century old, and those vaults
are still working ﬁne.” .
Private safe owners, like small
business people, often fail to
maintain their safes properly.
Private citizens also tend to
forget combinations (which safe
manufacturers do not record)

or die without revealing them
to heirs. That’s when Watters
gets the call. But what he really
relishes are extraordinary chal-

lenges such as one recent job;

opening a state—of-the-art vault
fronted by tempered glass.
“You couldn’t drill the door
from the outside because, as
soon as you cut the surface of the
glass it. will shatter. And when

If it’s a lock, it’s asafe bet

the glass breaks, it activates a
booby-trap that cross.-locks the
door from inside,” says Watters,
who wouldn’t reveal the vault’s
owner or location.

To beat the booby—trap, Wat-
ters employed a few of what
he calls his “McGyver tools,”
named after TV’s ingenious,
gadget-happy crime ﬁghter: a
ﬂexible drill and a German-made,
ﬁberoptic bore scope hooked up
to a TV monitor. "

Like a surgeon performing an
arthroscopic operation, Watters
drilled a small hole in the safe’s
side and inserted the drill 1.0
inches inside the safe. Based on
what the bore scope (which was
equipped with a high-intensity
light) showed of the safe’s interior,
Watters manipulated the ‘drill
so it turned left, then angled
up 25 degrees and drilled the
lock at that point. Next, Watters
maneuvered the drill downward,
bored another hole in the lock
— and popped it. ,

“Every safe that I open, I
plow the proceeds of that job
back into my research, so I can
buy new McGyver tools or make
them at my home workshop,”
Watters says. “In that sense,
I’m like the faculty members
I work with in the chemistry
department, reading the trade
journals [VVatters himself writes
a monthly column for the journal

Safe & Vault Technology] and.

working to‘ stay on the cutting
edge of my ﬁeld.”

Watters plans to do research
on “water bombs” such as the
one demonstrated in a movie
‘last _ year, , “The Heist,” starring

"Three minutes; tops" is how long chemistry department L
machinist Roy Watters says it takes him to crack a small. private
safe like this one- '

Robert DeNiro. In cracking a
supposedly impregnable safe,
DeNiro’s character ﬁrst burned
a hole in it using a 10,000—degree
thermal lance drill (VVatters owns
one), ‘then ﬁlled the safe with
water and dropped an explosive
charge down the hole.
Detonating the charge under
water produced a far more
powerful blast, and the safe
imploded without damaging its
contents. ' ‘
“Physics and chemistry,”
Watters says. “Basically, that’s
what safecracking is all about.”

Obviously, Watters’s craft has V

come a long way since VV1ld West
outlaws poured nitroglycerin
into cracks around the seals of
"bank safes, or rocked safes back
and forth until gravity did its
thing and the tumblers settled

- into their “open” positions.

But while safecrackers’ meth-
ods and tools have improved,
safes probably reached their peak

,of security, in the late 1890s,

according to Watters.

To outwit nitro—equipped
outlaws, manufacturers, created
“cannonballs”: round, tightly
sealed, double-locked safesimade
of manganese steel. “These were
probably the strongest safes ever
made,” says .Watters, who has

amassed a large collection of

safes and locks from around
the world. “The problem was,

they didn’t hold much and they" ,

took up a lot of room. As banks
needed more storage space, they
started building these big vault
rooms. It was common for banks
to keep a cannonball safe inside

Q the vault, tosstore the .large-

denomination money.”, 
According to Watters, a
17-ton cannonball safe has. sat,

locked, in the County Control—’ '
ler’s ofﬁce for the last 30 years,”

ever since staff misplaced the
combination. Watters says he
offered eight years ago to drill it
open, but ofﬁce administrators
balked at his price.
Cl

So much for safes going
bad. VVhat about professional
“safe technicians” themselves,
as Watters and his colleagues are
formally titled —— do they ever go
bad?‘With all of theirexpertise

and high-tech equipment,’ isn’t

crime a tempting career path?

' “In my 25’ years of safecrack-
ing, I know of only two guys
who have gone‘ bad,” Watters

' replies.

. Could Watters, if he wanted
to, rob a bank? '
“You’re asking me, could I

pull off a caper? I’d never answer A
that!”
But then, after a thoughtful '

pause, Watters continues: “I do
this work because it’s something
that I like to do, and I’m very

' good at it. It’s the same reason I’ve

been working at this university
for 22 ‘years. You don’t come here
looking to make a fortune, and

I you don’t stay here unless you

enjoy being in an environment
where the whole theme is educa-
tion." A I
“Don’t get me wrong,” Wat-
ters adds, perhaps sensing that
he’s sounding a bit too idealistic.
“I’ve been making my invest-
ments in the stock market and
TIAA-CREF,‘ and I can imagine
retiring early. And if I do, I’m‘
heading south to the islands. I’ll

China exaggerated

its economic growth, -

 ,,_.
countries have strug-
gled to recover from
the Asian-financial crisis of
the late 1990s, China has been
claiming economic growth rates
of 7 percent or better in recent
years. I .

But *a Pitt economics profes-
sor says those claims are exag-
gerated ——~ so much so, that
China’s’ growth since 1997 may

 

have been only .40_ percent of
. ofﬁcial rates.

Thomas G. Rawski has been

making headlines internationally V

with his published ﬁndings that
official measures of provincial
and national growth have suc-
cumbed to jiabao ﬁt/euafeng (a
wind of falsiﬁcation and embel-

“My research convinces me
that it is entirelypossible that
the Chinese economy actually

contracted by about 2 percent in t

1998, when the government was

reporting an increase in GDP

[Gross Domestic Product] of 7.8
percent,” said Rawski. “A similar
contraction may have occurred
during l999.”

‘ Chinese reports of 7-8 per-

’ cent growth duringthe last two

years “probably are exaggerated,
too,” but closer to reality than
the ofﬁcial. numbers from the
late 1990s, Rawski said.
Examining publicly available
sources such as The China Sta-
tistical Yearbook (“the skeptic’s
bible,” he calls it) and Chinese
press reports, Rawski detected
trends that contradict claims
of economic growth: declining
energy consumption, sluggish

retail sales, falling incomes in.

rural areas, and a steep decline
in employment growth. Rawski
also questions how farm output

province
(as the government reported)
despite ﬂoods that ranked among
China’s worst natural disasters
of the 20”” century. 4

“The year that I studied most .

closelywas 1998. And, to me, the
single most convincing element
[contradicting growth claims]
was civilian airline traffic,”
Rawski said. . 9

“We know that, in China,
incomeinequality is large and
expanding rapidly. So, whatever
income growth was in 1998,
rich peoples’ incomes ‘would
have gone up faster, and rich
people are more likely to travel
by airplane. On top of that,
there was a price war in China’s
airlines industry in 1998. Fares
were routinely discounted by
30-40 percent.

“So, you would expect pas-
senger trafﬁc to have gone up
pretty signiﬁcantly, for three
reasons: incomes reportedlywent
up, incomes among’ the higher-
paid segment of the population
would have gone up even more
and there was this huge reduction

in ticket prices. But, in fact,

civilian airline trafﬁc increased
by only 2.4 percent. That just
doesn’t ﬁt with an overall GDP
growth of 7.8 percent.” ~

As vigorously as Rawski
defends his conclusions, he
cringes at the way some news
media have reported them. v

“How Much Is China Cook-
ing Its Numbers?” ‘asked the

April 8 international editions of _

Business Week, in a cover‘ story
focusing on Rawski’s research.
Singapore’s The Straits Times

quoted Rawski in a March 27’

story, “Is China’s Economic

"Growth Just a Charade?” while

a story in the April 11 South
China Morning Post began,
“Economist Thomas Rawski has
underlined a long-held suspicion
that China’s growth is not what
it seems to be....While China’s
statisticseare getting more accu-
rate, it is no secret that there
is a fair amount of s/yui ﬁm, or
water, added to the data. China’s
economists and their statisticians
admit to the problem.” ,
Rawski knew .China’s eco-

nomic rivals and political critics A

would seize upon his ﬁndings.
“Some people say they don’t

» believe anything the Chinese say,

that it’s all a pack of lies, but I’m

‘ not among them,” said Rawski.

He disputed the reference to
China’s “cooking” of statistics

‘(“‘Cooking’ is not a word I would

use,” he said. “It’s neither fair
not accurate in describing what’s
going on, in China.”)

Rawski is sensitive to sensa-
tionalistic paraphrases of his
work for two reasons: He doesn’t»
want hypersensitive Chinese
ofﬁcials to "cancel his visa to do
research in China this summer,
and he doesn’t_want to insult
Chinese economists and statisti-
cians, most of whom he considers
to be conscientious and hard-
working ——- whether or not they
agree with his analyses.

“I think there. are a lot of
people in China who are sympa-
thetic with my perspective,” he
said. “I’ve been in the ofﬁces of
the [Chinese] National Bureau

ofStatistics~(NBS)when Chinese ‘

colleagues have said to me: ‘Look
at these data from such-and-
such a province. They make no

sense. _VVho can believe these
‘- -‘ﬁ‘~’f""'_*"‘=v§"‘ ¢':-*‘’5'‘’-“" ' "

can’t do anything about" it,
because we have a vertical system
and our job is just to assemble

. and integrate the information we

receive from the provinces.’”

According to Rawski, a retired
NBS director said that keeping
accurate statistics was particularly
difﬁcult in 1998, commenting
that “deceiving the nation and
tricking the people can lead to
untold disasters.” Premier Zhu
Rongji -himself complained in
2000 that statistical falsiﬁcation
and exaggeration were ram-
pant. ’ 1

A Rawski argues that falsely
upbeat. reporting is endemic
to all large. bureaucracies, not
just quasi-socialist economies or
China in particular. He compared
China to an American city where
the mayor pressures staff to
inﬂate census numbers so the
city will get more federal aid,
or a U.S."military force in
which generals seek to bulldo_ze
pet weapons systems through
Congress, while discouraging
underlings from reporting system
breakdowns and safety con-
cerns. '

Rawski described the follow-
ing scenario for China’s skewed
economic reporting: “In 1998,
Chinese policy—makers were
very concerned about a possible
downtrend in the economy due
‘to the Asian ﬁnancial crisis, which
hit some of the most dynamic

sectors of their economy, such as .

exports and foreign investment,”
he said.

“This was an economy that
already was experiencing sub-
stantial difﬁculties; 1996 and
1997 were years of steeply declin-
ing job creation, large—scale
layoffs in the urban sector,’and

  

very poor household incomes
in the villages. In 1995, the
Chinese had discovered idle
capacity all over the place in the
manufacturing sector.

“So, this already-troubled
economy gets slammed by the
totally unexpected Asian crisis,
and China’s government tries to
prop up the economy through
deﬁcit spending and cutting
interest rates, exactly the mea-
sures that would be undertaken
here under similar circumstances.
The government also announces
a campaign to achieve 8 percent
growth during 1998. Provincial
ofﬁcials were told, ‘VVhatever
segment of the economy you’re
responsible for must contribute
its share to 8 percent growth.’
Shanghai’s municipal govern-
ment even ordered its subordi-
nate units to draw up plans to
achieve 12 percent growth. All

‘plans that did not call for 12

percent growth were returned
for revisions. —

“These kinds of instructions
were passed down the ladder.
That, in my opinion, is where
the trouble started.”

Pressured to meet impos-
sible goals, local and provincial
ofﬁcials submitted exaggerated

or even fabricated reports to
national statisticians, who were
powerless to verify the numbers.
“There’s an old slogan: Ofﬁcials
make statistics, and statistics
make ofﬁcials — meaning, if
you produce the right statistics,
you get promoted,” said Rawski.
“My concern is that, in this
environment, these same politi-
cal pressures could engulf the
National Bureau of Statistics
itself.”

Rawski doesn’t know what‘

motivated Chinese senior ofﬁ-
cials to set unrealistic economic
goals in the ﬁrst place. “I study
China’s economy, notits politics,”
he said.

But he noted that the souring

of China’s economy coincided
with Zhu Rongji’s succession as
premier. “A political scientist col-
league of mine has pointed out:
Here you had a new administra-
tion, the economy is already
facing difficulties, and then

' comes this Asian ﬁnancial crisis.

My colleague suggests that this
[exaggerated economic report-
ing] was done to preserve the
legitimacy and reputation of the
new government.” -

Even foreign businesses that invest in China with the goal
of selling to Chinese consumers care little about the country’s
GDP, Rawski noted, because they target speciﬁc groups rather
than the country as a whole. “If Proctor and Gamble sees an
opportunity to sell shampoo because dandruff is especially
unsightly for people with black hair — and China has lots of
people with black hair —— they want to know how shampoo
is selling. They don’t care much that China’s GDP has been
exaggerated.” - ~

Such exaggeration does have implications for U.S. trade
and defense policies, said Rawski. “The Chinese have always
been very straightforward in stating that one of the beneﬁts
of economic growth is that it enables them to increase China’s
military power,” he said. “It’s entirely possible that our; own
military bases its policies in Asia partly on perceptions of the
Chinese economy. As a citizen, I think it’s in everybody’s interest
for the U.S. defense establishment to have reliable information
about Chinese economic growth, and that information has been
in short supply in recent years.” .

But the biggest losers in China’s jiabao ﬁt/euaferzg are the
nation’s senior ofﬁcials, Rawski maintains. “China faces very
difﬁcult economic problems. Without being able to trust the
statistics they’re given, China’s leaders are forced to make tough
choices with a partial-blindfold.” _ ' i

MAY 2, 2002

Off the beaten path: Hiking is

serious business for physics prof

he word “professorial”
comes to mind when you
see Richard H. Pratt in
his Allen Hall ofﬁce, catching up
on some reading while munch-
ing a banana, at a desk stacked
with physics journals and ﬂoppy
isks. '

The emeritus professor’s
unruly, thinning gray hair droops
low across his forehead, one
strand obscuring his eyebrows.
He’s wearing black pants and a
short—sleeved dress shirt. 'Only
his footwear — thick—soled
hiking shoes — hints at Pratt’s
weekend adventures in the wilds
of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West
Virginia.

Since 1970, six years after he
joined the Pitt faculty, Pratt has
been leading off—trail hikes for
the Sierra Club. He also leads
hikes for the University’s Center

for Lifetime Learning (formerly .

the Pitt Informal Program). And,

_during his travels as secretary.

of the International Radiation
Physics Society and on Pitt’s
Semester at Sea program, Pratt
has hiked up]apan,’s Mt. Fuji and
in the Himalayas, the Roma-
nian Carpathians and Poland’s
Tatras. _ _ I

“I am a hiker, however, not
a rock climber,” Pratt notes. “I

I stay on my feet.”

But rarely does he stay on

. the trail.

“Dick is an aggressive hiker,”

 V,

of linguistics. “He’s known for
avoiding trails at all costs.” De
Keyser cautions that people
who join Pratt’s hikes should be
prepared to get tired, muddy, “a
bit scratched up” and, occasion-
ally, even lost — temporarily,
until Pratt regains his bearings
with his compass and knowledge
of regional terrain.

« De Keyser’s warning applies
only to Pratt’s 12-16 mile, off-
trail hikes with fellow Sierra
Club members, Pratt himself

points out, not the ‘‘leisurely’’ ,

seven-mile and “moderately
strenuous” 10-mile hikes that

he leads for Pitt’s Center for -

Lifetime Learning. Pratt is
among three leaders of the
center’s next hike, scheduled
for May 16. It will explore
the Coopers‘Rock State Forest
(a 90-minute drive from Pitts-
burgh) and trails above the neigh-
boring Cheat River Gorge.
“My introduction to hiking
was with my father,” Pratt recalls.
“I grew up in upstate Michigan,
in a little town called Mount

" Pleasant. The Chippewa River

ﬂows through it, and we would
hike along that. Later, when I

- was 9 or 10, we hiked together

in Vermont.”

Pratt took a hiking hiatus ,

until 1970, when the Sierra
Club’s local branch was founded.
Pratt was elected as the branch’s
second chairperson, and later
served as the club’s state chairper-
son and regional vice president.
During the early 1970s, Pratt
wrote two of the original stud-
ies proposing that the U.S.
Congress designate wilderness

areas in Pennsylvania’s Allegheny T‘

National Forest.

 .- an --.-4 »V 649 I ~--.-I 
r, an associate professor

“It was a long political ﬁght,”
Pratt says. “One of the three
areasended up being designated
a wilderness area. The other
two became national recreation
areas.”‘Even the less restrictive
“recreation area” designations
were ﬁercely opposed by the

« timber industry and state legisla-

tors in northwestern Pennsylva-
nia -— which shouldn’t surprise
anyone who followed the recent
controversy involving Pitt’s

In retaliation for the clinic’s

Physics professor emeritus Richard H. Pratt at a Senate Council

representation of activists
opposed to logging in the Allegh-
eny National Forest, state law-
makers last year forbade spending
state money on the clinic. Until
law school personnel worked out
a deal whereby the clinic will
remain a self-supported part of
the school, it faced bankruptcy
or exile. l
Before the ’ conﬂict between
clinic personnel and state legisla-
tors hit the news media, Sierra

‘ Club leaders approached Pratt to

help resolve the issue. Pratt had

meeting (right) and (above) leading a Sierra Club-sponsored

hike in the Charles Lewis’ Natural Area of theconemaugh Gorge.
The latter shot was provided by Ann Pratt, Richard's wife, who

explained why she could not provide a photo of her husband on
the move: "Pictures of Richard actually hiking all show o
back - he always takes the lead." ~

long served on the University
Planning and Budgeting Com-
mittee and other Pitt governance
groups, and the issue had obvious
budgetary implications.

“But then the [anti-logging] .

activists went public, and I saw
no point in trying to work behind
the scenes to resolve the issue,”
Pratt says.

Pratt prefers a quiet style of

activism, in public or academic’

politics. “I suppose I’m low-key
by choice. I’m just not the
ﬂamboyant type.”

But, in Pratt’s case, “low—key”
should not be equated with “low-
intensity,” as anyone who has
observed Pratt during meetings

of the University Senate’s budget

policies committee can attest.

Majorityof Pittsburgh Magazine’s  
“best docs” are Pitt/UPMC physicians

More than 250 physicians in
34 specialties from Pitt’s School
of Medicine and UPMC Health
System hospitals are included
in the list of “best doctors”
published in the April issue
of Pittsburgh Magazine. This
accounts for 75 percent of the
total number of physicians name
in the list. \ e"

The current listing is the
result of a survey undertaken by
Best Doctors, Inc., ofAiken, S.C.,
a national provider of informa-
tion about the best medical care
available.

According to Pittsburgh

Magazine, more than 30,000.

doctors throughout the United
States were asked the question,
If a loved one needed a doctor in
your specialty, to whom would

you refer them?

Evaluations of the thousands
of doctors named —— some of
them by hundreds of their peers
— are weighed, scored. and
ﬁltered for bias. Only those
physicians who earned the con-
sensus support of their peers
were included in- the best doctors

I list.

“This is one more veriﬁcation
of the medical excellence of our
physicians,” saidjeffrey Romoff,
president of UPMC Health
System. “Those who reside in
western’ Pennsylvania can ‘be
assured that the finest health care
available is located right here in
their own community.” -

Specialties in which UP-MC
physicians are named include
allergy and immunology, anes-

thesiology, cardiovascular dis-

' ease, clinical pharmacology,

colon and rectal surgery, endo-
crinology and metabolism, family
medicine, gastroenterology,
geriatric medicine, infectious
disease, internal medicine, medi-

monary and critical care medi-
cine, radiation oncology, radiol-

gery-and urology. I

to mind: Pratt’s grilling of a
Pitt administrator several years
ago regarding the University’s
then-inconsistent (in some cases,
exorbitant) rates for international
telephone calls.

The administrator fended off
other professors’ questions but
couldn’t shake Pratt. Without
raising his voice — although
his eyebrows were working
overtime, expressing skepticism
and sarcasm — Pratt pounced
on the slightest inconsistency in
the administrator’s presentation
until the man ﬁnally apologized
and admitted to Pratt’s com-
mittee: “Basically, we screwed

up.
E]

Pratt has sailed around the
world twice as a dean on Semester
at Sea. During his ﬁrst voyage, in
fall 1984, he initiated what came
to be called the Dean’s Hikes,
expeditions he led through rustic
areas near ports where the ship
docked. Semester at Sea still
offers the hikes but no longer calls
them “Dean’s Hikes” because
subsequent deans weren’t always
physically up to leading them.

Pratt himself is still going
strong, despite being diabetic
and nearing his 68th birthday.
“A young, vigorous hiker might
go a bit faster, but I can still hike
a good, steady pace,” he says.
“And I keep going for eight or
10 hours a day. I’m not a bird-
watcher and I don’t stop for
photographs. I’ll make a couple
of 10-minute stops and spend 30
minutes for lunch.”

At that pace, Pratt and his
fellow hikers either scare off, or
don’t spot, a lotof wildlife. “I’vc

‘seen onerbear insome 30>years

of hiking around here. That
was fairly recently, down along
Laurel Hill Creek. He ran away
from us.” Pratt also reports
having seen deer herds, ﬂocks
of wild turkeys and several
rattlesnakes (including “a couple
of impressively big_ones,” he
says) within a one- or two—hour
drive of Pittsburgh.

Pratt has gotten caught in
some impressive storms, most
recently during a hike last
December in Linn Run, south
of Route 30. “It was sunny and
40 degrees during the day, with
a light coating of snow. We
hiked to the ridge of the Laurel
Highlands trail that goes over
to~the Turnpike, looking at
rock’ formations. One person
wanted to look for more, but
I was getting uneasy about the
weather,” Pratt says. “Indeed, a
blizzard soon closed in on us.”

Pratt led the group down off

the ridge in blinding snow, at ‘

dusk, not knowing’ whether
they would be able to cross the
stream at the,ridge’s base. “In
the end,” he says, “we found an
old footbridge across the stream,
then walked along the road for a
few miles‘, through eight inches
of snow with ice under it.” V '

What makes Pratt hike?
“Oh, enjoyinggbeing out, seeing
and understanding more of the
world,” he replies. “Enjoying
peace and solitude. Exploring.
Satisfying one’s curiosity.”-

He doesn’t plan to retire from
hiking, off- or on-campus. “I have
never ridden the campus bus,”
Pratt says, grinning‘ proudly.
“And except when I’m in the

Cathedral of Learning, I almost '

never use an elevator.” - — .

he rags—to—riches story‘

of a local inner—city kid,

and the implications of
his success as a role "model for
today’s society, were the themes
at Pitt’s April 2 8 commencement
convocation.

North Side native, Pitt alum-
nus and Pitt trustee Vl/illiam E.
Strickland Jr. was the featured
speaker at the Mellon Arena
where the University conferred
nearly 6,700 bachelor’s, master’s
and ﬁrst professional degrees,
including 401 doctorates.

After the opening of the com-
mencement ceremony by James
H. Cassing, chief University
marshal and president of the

University Senate, and the tra-
ditional procession of faculty,
deans and administrative ofﬁcers
in academic regalia, Chancellor
Mark A. N ordenberg welcomed
the 15,000—plus faculty, class of
2 002 graduates, family and friends
of the University in attendance
and then introduced Strickland.
N ordenberg called Strickland

' an individual who _exempliﬁes the

best qualities of a Pitt graduate,
including intellectual curiosity,
high achievement, humanitarian
endeavors and dignity embodied
in a fully realized life.

Once Strickland got to Pitt,
Nordenberg said, his “new—found
love of learning produced an
honors graduate at the beginning
of an extraordinary career, [who
holds] the belief that this same
opportunity should be available
to every young person in this
country.”

While still a Pitt undergradu-
ate, Nordenberg noted, Strick-
land founded the Manchester
Craftsmen’s Guild, which he now
heads as president and CEO,
to combat economic and social
deprivation in his predominantly
African American North Side
neighborhood through an arts
program that works with at—risk
public school children. .

Strickland also is president
and CEO of the Bidwell Training
Center, a vocational training
program for un— and underem-

‘ ployed adults in the Pittsburgh

region.

Among Strickland’s many
honors are the Pitt Distinguished
Alumni Fellows Award and Pitt
Legacy Laureates award, and the
Pennsylvania GOVernor’s Award
for Arts Leadership and Service.
Strickland has served as a council
member of the National Endow-
ment for the Arts and, with his
Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild
colleagues, won a Grammy award
for the recording of a jazz concert
there.

The Pittsburgh Post—Ga—
zette named him one of the
50 most inﬂuential business
executives in the area.

Prior to delivering his com-
mencement address, Strick-
land ‘was awarded an honorary
Doctor of Fine Arts degree, his
seventh honorary degree, by
Pitt Board of Trustees Chair
Vl/"1lliam'S. Dietrich II, who
cited Strickland’s roles as artist,
teacher, social entrepreneur
and genius, and praised him
for his dedication to human
potential. V

“I knew I’d ﬁnd an easy
way to get a Pitt Ph.D. if I

waited long enough,” Strickland .

, quipped in accepting the honor:
ary degree.

“I was admitted to the Uni-
versity as a probationary. stu-
dent,” he continued. “I now sit
on the board of this University,

its executive committee and

the board of UPMC. I have

received a MacArthur Award,
lectured at the Harvard and
i Stanford business schools, the
Kellogg School and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh....
“The?-point of my sharing
some of my life accomplish-

ments is not to promote my
own image, but, hopefully, to
dramatically illustrate that one
should never give up on the poor
and underprivileged kids in the

I world, because you never know

what potential exists within each
of those children. They might
end up being the commencement
speaker one day.” .
Strickland said his under-
graduate education was the

cornerstone of his success in

life.

“This University believed
in me, and I believe in it. I
received a superior undergradu-
ate ‘education and was taught by
an extraordinary array of faculty
that could be favorably compared
to- the best in the world,” said
Strickland, who earned a B.A.
cum laude in history in 1970.

“For an inner—city,kid to be
exposed to this level of intel-
lectual and academic excellence
was pure energy unleashed and
provided me with the opportu-
nity to give life a pretty good
run. It also provided me with
the confidence I needed to
take this teaching and apply it
to my neighborhood and the
children who came from a similar

background.” .
Strickland also broached
“difﬁcult subjects” that “indicate
all is not well,” including the
long odds for success that the

~_- _~ poor and uneducated face in this .

country.

“It is my hope that you will
begin to realize that in many
instances people do not have to
be living in the way they are,”
he told the Mellon Arena'audi—
ence. “In many states, including
Pennsylvania, it costs well over
$40,000 a year to incarcerate

people, most of whom look‘

like me, and, in many cases,
could attend college for half
that amount. Rather than give
those same persons a college
education, our community seems
more than willing to build as

many prisons as the budget will A

allow but unwilling or unable
to create effective educational
institutions in the neighborhoods
where people live their lives, day
in and day out.”

He added that within 10
minutes’ walk of the Mellon

Arena there are homeless and’

hungry people, “which under-

scores the absurdity that people _,

in the richest and most powerful
country on Earth” are living in

poverty.
nMoreover,. the problems

extend beyond the United States, ‘

he said. “If one steps back to
analyze the effects of Sept. 11th
and all the horriﬁc acts of cruelty
perpetrated on innocent people,

at the core of it all is ignorance -

and poverty.”

Strickland urged the Univer-
sity to live up to its potential
in bettering the country by
promoting education and equal
opportunity.

“Within the University. of
Pittsburgh, we have the talent
and board leadership to set an
example for the nation as to how
to do it right—how to bring the
balance of outstanding academic

leadership combined with the
passion "for sports excellence
and lead the way in effecting
solutions of both a medical and
technological nature,” Strickland

“This University has had
the good sense to create new
opportunities for minority fac—

ulty in the health sciences and in .

advanced technology for one and
one reason only: It was the right
thing to do,” he said.

“VVhere else on the planet
could a graduation with the
diversity represented in this
arena take place? VVhere the
grandchildren of former steel-
workers sit beside the great-
grandchildren of slaves in’ free-

’ dom and excitement and prosper-

ity?”

Finally, Strickland congratu-
lated the graduates on their
accomplishments. “I can say
with absolute certainty that this

RESEARCH NOTES

Grants
awarded to
researchers

The National Institute of
Mental Health has granted
social work professor Carol
Anderson $321,622 to create
an infrastructure to facilitate
mental health research careers
of social work faculty. Her work
will address three areas: coercion
and adherence in the seriously
mentally ill, help-seeking and
barriers to mental health treat-
ment in women and families,
and a pathway to care for the
undiagnosed population at risk.

The engineering school’s
Thomas J. Cain has been
awarded $750,000 from the
Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic
Development to administer a
program supporting the continu-
ing education component of the
Pittsburgh Digital Greenhouse’s
Electronic Design Education
Program.

The National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute has granted
$555,865 to psychology profes-
sor Stephen Manuck for biobe—
havioral studies of cardiovascular
disease.

Jonathan Wolff of the Uni-
versity Center for International
Studies has received a $432,103
Freeman Foundation grant to
promote greater understanding
of Asia by providing opportuni-
ties for more Pitt students to
study Asian languages, cultures
and civilization; by sharing
expertise with the community
through an outreach program,

and by improving use of elec-
tronic media to enhance access to
resources concerning Asia.

The National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences
has awarded $673,602 to the
medical school’s Reza Zamegar
to study hepatocyte growth
factor gene transcription and
function in the liver.

NIH grant
awarded to
musculoskeletal
research center
Savio L—Y. Woo, the A.B.
Ferguson Professor of Ortho-
paedic Surgery and director of
Pitt’s Musculoskeletal Research
Center (MSRC), together with
James Wang, co-director of the
Mechanobiology Laboratory,
has been awarded a $2.1 million
grant by the National Institutes

‘of Health for a project, “MCL

Healing: Interdisciplinary Stud-
1es.”

The research project also
is in collaboration with Chris
Niyibizi of the MSRC’s Fergu-
son Lab and consultants Leaf
Huang of Pitt, Cy Frank of the

I University of Calgary, Canada,

and Stephen Badylak of Purdue
University. Together, they
will use new and innovative
approaches including antisense
gene therapy on Type III & Type
V collagens and functional tissue
engineering techniques involv-
ing the use of small intestinal
submucosa (SIS) to improve

the healing of. injured knee

ligaments.

This is the third time the
NIH has renewed this project.
It began ‘more than 20‘ years

' ago when Woo received funding

for 15 years from the Veterans
Administration in San Diego
to study the function of. knee
ligaments, including the deter-
mination of fundamental tissue
properties and how they are
inﬂuenced by various biological
factors. '
Concurrently, this research
established a foundation for
accurate and repeatable experi-
mental protocols by studying the
effects of multiple experimental
factors. This was followed by
a series of studies involving

the development of a ligament

rupture model in animals to
investigate the time course of
healing in response to different
treatment modalities. These
studies have shaped current
clinical management of ligament
injuries including the important
concept of “controlled motion
is good” after MCL injury and
that surgical repair of a ruptured
MCL has no beneﬁt. ' _

Scientiﬁcally, a major ﬁnding
of this research was that healing
ligaments result, in a greater
quantity of a lesser quality tissue.
Therefore, recent efforts have
focused on the use of growth
factors, gene therapy’ and cell
therapy as methods to. improve
ligament healing and perhaps
the possibility to regenerate
ligaments

By using novel tools that
include antisense gene therapy
and SIS scaffolds, this most
recent NIH competitive renewed
grant will attempt to restore the
biochemical composition and
tissue organization of the healing
MCL to normal levels. Further’,
it is hoped this work will lead to
a greater understanding about

OCD to provide
research data
Pitt’s Ofﬁceof Child Devel-
opment (OCD) will be provid-
ing evidence—based research on
the state’s childhood care and

education delivery system to,

Pennsylvania’s new Early‘ Care
and Education Task Force, cre-
ated last month by Gov. Mark
Schweiker. . .

Pitt’s OCD, Penn State’s
College of Health and Human
Development, and Temple Uni-
versity’s Center for Public Policy

. have formed a University Chil-

dren’s Policy Collaborative,.
which will examine existing. and
potential programs and services
for children from birth to age 8
and then make recommendations
to the 33—member task force.
Each university will explore a
different component: The Penn
State research team will observe

activity at 400 early childhood 3

sites, Temple will conduct a

survey of Pennsylvania parents

who are consumers of early

childhood services, and" Pitt’s

OCD ‘research will be three-
pronged —— a review of national
research literature to assess best
practices»; a statewide survey of
providers of early childhood
services; and a survey of organiza-
tions, colleges and universities
that train professionals in early
childhood services.

“This is a wonderful oppor-
tunity for the universities to
work together and to provide the
state with balanced, nonpartisan
information on early childhood
services,” said Robert McCall,
who, along with Christine
Groark, is co-director of OCD.
Other OCD personnel assisting
with the project are Robert
Nelkin, director of policy initia-
tives; Wendy Ethridge, project

manager for policy initiatives,.

and Pitt graduate student Kelly
Mehafﬁe.

The task force will issue two
reports to Schweiker this fall
that will contain evidence-based,
cost-effective strategies that
can be passed on to the next
administration.

I-Iahitat size
determines
productivity]
diversity
relationship

The size of the habitat is
crucial to determining the rela-
tionship between the biodiversity
and the individual productivity
of species, according to a study

a by scientists at Pitt and the

University of Chicago. The study
was published in the March 28
edition of Nature.

Jonathan M. Chase, an
assistant professor of community
ecology in Pitt’s Department of
Biological Sciences, and Mathew

A. Leibold, of the University
of Chicago, studied wetland
plants, both submerged and
emergent, and wetland animals
— amphibians and invertebrates
such as insects and snails _—
near the Kellogg Biological

Station run by Michigan State
University. Chase found similar
patterns at Pitt’s Pymatuning
Laboratory of Ecology near
Linesville, Pa.

- “Ecologists have long recog-
nized that species diversity in
a particular site is affected by
many factors, but that primary
productivity is one of the most
important,” said Chase. “Primary
productivity is often determined
by available nutrients, light,
rainfall and the like. However,
there is a lot of conﬁision and
controversy about just how
diversity varies with productiv-
1 I”

Ecologists define primary
productivity in ﬂora as the
efﬁciency of collecting carbon,
in the form of carbon dioxide,
through photosynthesis. Chase
and Leibold. found that in
small habitats, the productivity/
diversity relationship followed
a hump—shaped pattern where
species diversity increases at
ﬁrst, then declines as the primary
productivity increases. In ‘larger
habitats, the researchers found
that the relationship followed a

steady increase, with no subse— .

quent decline.

Researchers deﬁne a small-
scale habitat as being a small
pond, for instance, and a large-
scale habitat as a series of ponds

in a watershed that could, Be»-

as largeéan area asa county or
state. ’

“This ‘scale dependence’
happens because small com-
munities become more different
from one_another as produc-
tivity increases, and thus the
entire diversity of the large
scale increases, even though
the diversity on the small scale
decreases,” Chase explained.
“Our work was in wetlands, but
similar results are likely to hold
in a variety of different types
of ecosystems. In addition, our
work might help to explain large
patterns such as the increases in

species diversity as you move to a

the tropics.”
The natural inclination to

always associate higher produc.— '
tivity with more diversity is not — .

the case, and Chase said that
several recent studies of small-
scale habitats do not support
that assumption.

“For example, if one species , ‘

is very productive, it might be
able to ‘steal’ all theresources,

‘ and biodiversity would be very ‘

low,” he said.l“At' very low
productivity, there are very
few species. At intermediate
productivity, more species can
exist, but at high productivity,

a few species can use all of the.

resources, and biodiversity gets
low again. However, we found

things are different when you _

look at a different spatial scale,
like a whole watershed of several
ponds. Here, diversity increases
consistently as productivity
increases. ,

“So, the main question. is,
‘How can diversity go down at
high productivity at the small
scale, but continue to increase at
the larger scale?’ We found that

CONTINUED ONPAGE 11

MAY 2, 2002

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 10

it could do this because the
types of species that lived in
different high productivity ponds
were highly variable,” Chase
continues. “In some ponds, a
group of species live_d together,
but in nearby ponds, an entirely
different group of species lived
together. So, if you add the
two" groups up, you get high
biodiversity, even though in
a single pond, there was low
biodiversity. This clariﬁes the
dilemma of why diversity goes
down with increasing productiv-
ity in small-scale habitats, but
goes up in large—scale ones.”

Chase said his work with
Leibold holds several implica-
tions for understanding the
effectsthat humans have onthe
environment.

“Many human actions, such
as fertilizer runoff from farmers’
ﬁelds, increase the amount of
nutrients that enter wetlands.
Our work helps us to understand
what the effects of these actions

. might have for species diversity

of plants and animals within
single ponds and within entire
watersheds.” ‘

Test identifies
patients at risk

for severe

organ rejection
A simple blood test takes.
much of the guesswork out of
predicting who -is at risk for
severe organ rejection, according
to results of two Pitt studies.
The test, called ELISA

  
  

. ('.'?g‘E“' .2-

aiiies if a patient

has speciﬁc antibodies that are
trained to ﬁght the presence of
foreign antigens.

According to results in stud-
ies of pediatric heart and adult
lung transplant patients, ELISA
does a better job of identifying

patients with sensitized immune '

systems than the widely used,
less sensitive test -called PRA
based on lymphocytotoxicity,

. which determines apercentage of

panel reactive antibody. Having
more reliable information may
help clinicians tailor therapies to
prevent rejection from actually
occurring. -
, Indeed, in a retrospective
study of pediatric heart trans-
plant patients, four of the ﬁve
“rejecters” were not identiﬁed as
being sensitized by conventional
PRA. V

“ELISA identiﬁed children
not considered sensitized by
conventional PRA.yet who are
clearly at risk for rejection.
Knowing -in advance who may
warrant more intense immuno-
suppression following heart

transplantation is very useful

clinical i_nformation,” explained
Sabrina Tsao, a cardiology
fellow with the pediatric heart
transplant program at Pitt’s
School_ of Medicine and Chil-
_dren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

_ Using blood samplesof 36
patients obtained within a month
before transplantation, research-
ers performed the ELISA test
to see if results correlated with
their actual clinical course. They

. found that ELISA determined 10

to three of the 26 negative-
ELISA patients who developed
rejection.

“Having this information
before transplantation might
have changed how we treated
patients prone to rejection.
While we’ll want to study a
greater number of patients, the
results of this study suggest
ELISA should be part of our rou-
tine clinical care,” added senior
author Steven A. Webber,
associate professor of pediatrics
at Pitts medical school and direc-
tor of the pediatric heart and lung
transplant program at Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh.

Eight of the 10 ELISA-
positive patients had congenital
heart disease and_ probably were
more sensitized to certain anti-
gens because of blood transfu-
sions received during past open-
heart surgeries.

In a similar study involving
75 adult lung transplant patients
who underwent ELISA testing
after transplantation, six of
14 deemed positive developed
persistent, acute rejection within
the ﬁrst 100 days of transplanta-
tion compared to nine of 61 who
were negative. Similar results
were obtained at follow—up
periods up to a year.

ELISA is a simple test that
takes about four hours to obtain
a positive or negative result.
Blood drawn from the patient
contains the patient’s own unique
antibodies, which are put into
contact with known human
leuko e..antigsnS.(HLA),m01-

that characterize each person as
unique and enable the immune
system to recognize both self
and foreign I antigens. If the
patient’s antibodies bind" with
any of the antigens, then the test
is considered positive.

Value found in '
new way to_
report cervical
abnormalities

. New practitioner guidelines
on the management of women-
with suspicious cellular changes
identiﬁed during gynecological

exams should improve screening

methods to more easily detect’

signiﬁcant changes that could
lead to cervical cancer, accord-
ing to a consensus statement

published in last week’s]oumal of .

the American Medical Associa-
tion. '

Called the 2001 Bethesda _

System, the guidelines were
formulated in part based on
results from a large, four—center
trial known as the ASCUS/LSIL
Triage Study, or ALTS, which
determined that testing women
with mildly abnormal cellular
changes for the presence of the
human papillomavirus (HPV) is
an important indicator of a more
serious condition needing more
aggressive treatment. '
“Everyone agrees on how
to manage high—grade disease,”
said Richard Guido, an assistant
professor of obstetrics, gynecol-
ogy and reproductive sciences
at Pitt’s "School of Medicine
and principal investigator of the
ALTS study at Magee-Womens
Hospital. “But with more subtle
changes, the options are often
up to the individual practitioner.

These guidelines should help to
illuminate the question.”
ASCUS and LSIL are acro-
nyms for two mild abnormali-
ties ' detected in gynecological
screening tests known as atypical
squamous cells of undetermined
signiﬁcance or low-grade squa-

mous intraepithelial lesion. The

2001 Bethesda System guidelines
also shorten ASCUS to ASC, for
atypical squamous cells.

The Papanicolaou, or Pap
test, has been used since the
19505 in the United States as
a screening tool to help detect
cellular abnormalities in the
cervix. Approximately 20 mil-
lion Pap smears are performed
annually in this country, said
Guido. - .

Until now, most women with
ASCUS results could be advised
to undergo repeat Pap testing at
speciﬁed intervals, even though
such mild abnormalities often
will disappear Without treatment.
What the ALTS study found,
however, was that subsequent
HPV testing could identify
virtually all of the cases requiring

immediate attention. Those

women with mild changes
detected by Pap who were HPV-
positive were much more likely
to have undetected precancerous
conditions or cancer. -

In 1996, the U.S. Food and —

Drug Administration ‘approved
a liquid—based screening test
that some studies have shown to

be more accurate at detecting‘

precancerous’ cervical lesions.

—Nationwi<1¢..ab,out_ 69 ps..r..¢ent  
of screening exams now involve
the liquid—based test, which _

can include follow-up HPV
screening from the same sample
without recalling the patient for
another visit. ' 6

According to the Centers for '

Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, nearly 1 3,000 women
are diagnosed with cervical
cancer each year. Early detection
efforts have substantially reduced
the death rates from this cancer,
but more remains to be done,
CDC ofﬁcials note. More than
4,000 women are expected to
die of cervical cancer yearly,
largely because they failed to take

advantage of, "or lacked access —

to, available screening.

Controlling systolic "blood

pressure early prevents _

heart disease in elderly
Hypertensive elderly indi-

viduals who begin blood pressure

‘therapy before signs of heart

disease appear may completely
avoid the associated cardiovas-
cular problems, according to
Kim Sutton—Tyrrell, associate
professor of epidemiology.

“We found that elderly indi-
viduals with untreated systolic

hypertension are three times
more likely to experience adverse
cardiovascular events like heart
attack, angina, stroke or heart
failure than are elderly individu-
als with normal blood pressure,”
said Sutton—Tyrrell. “However,
hypertensive study participants
who underwent treatment ' for
their high blood pressure greatly
reduced their risk of adverse
cardiovascular events, particu-
larly if they were still free of
detectable disease when they
initiated treatment.”

The Pittsburgh study con-
sisted of 134 participants taking
hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic
commonly prescribed for sys-
tolic hypertension (the “active”
group), and 134 taking a pla-
cebo.

A Polycystic ovary syndrome

can lead to coronary
artery calciﬁcation

Women with polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS) are at risk
for premature calcification in
their coronary arteries — an
early indication of cardiovascular
disease, according to Evelyn O.
Talbott, professor of epidemiol-
ogy and principal investigator on
the study. However, controlling

weight and insulin sensitivity
may reduce the risk

PCOS, characterized by men-
strual irregularities, chronic
anovulation, excess hair growth
and infertility,_ is a common
reproductive endocrine disorder
affecting 5 percent of the female
population. Women with PCOS
also experience several metabolic
abnormalities, including insulin
resistance, increased circulating
insulin levels, abnormal blood
lipid levels and increased central
obesity (“apple body shape”).
Until recently, PCOS was not
recognized as a single, multi-
dimensional disorder. Women
suffering from it were instead
treated for individual symptoms,
particularly irregular menstrual
periods and infertility.

“Preliminary results from
our study suggest an associa-
tion between the metabolic
abnormalities experienced by
women with PCOS, collectively
termed’ metabolic Syndrome
X or metabolic cardiovascular
syndrome, and premature ath-
erosclerosis in the coronary
arteries,” Talbott said. Coronary
calcium deposits are an indicator
of early, subclinical cardiovascu-
lar disease. I

Marathon run to raise cancer research funds

Kevin McClatchy, CEO and
managing general partner of the
Pittsburgh Pirates, will run the
UPMC Health System/City of
Pittsburgh Marathon on May'5 to
raise money for cancer research
in memory of his friend, Patti
Burns, long—time KDKA-TV
news anchorwoman who died of

lung cancer last year.

The Patti Burns Memorial
Cancer Fund will support
research being conducted at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute (UPCI) to detect and
treat cancer early, before it has
had a chance to spread.

Lung cancer is the leading
cause of cancer deaths in the
United States. Itis often detected
after symptoms have already

appeared and long after it has
‘ spread, resulting in very low

survival rates.

The funds raised at the
UPMC Health System/City of
Pittsburgh Marathon also will
support the Patti Burns Memo-
rial Fellowship to aid talented
young physicians and investiga-
tors in their research endeavors
and to recruit new talent to the
Pittsburgh area.

A plaque commemorating
the fund—raising effort will be
displayed in the Hillman Cancer
Center, slated to open this fall
in Shadyside.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Employees can still sign up for
long-term care insurance plan

t’s ofﬁcial: Pitt will begin pro-

vidingits employees optional,

long-term. care insurance at
group rates beginning July 1,
now that the required 5 percent
of eligible staff and faculty have
signed up for the plan.

Some 9,600 employees
(including full—time and tenured
part-time faculty, and regular
full-time staff working at least
18.75 hours per week) had been
classiﬁed as “guarantee issue”
employees, meaning they would
automatically be accepted for
group long-term care insurance
—-without having to ﬁll out a
medical questionnaire — if they
enrolled by April 30.

As of Monday morning, about
480 “guarantee issue” employees
had enrolled, exceeding the 5
percent minimum required for
the plan to be offered here,
said James W Edgerton, assis-
tant vice chancellor for Human
Resources. a

‘‘I’m guessing that with the
activity we’ve had in the last
couple of days, that number
is probably going to go up by
another 40 or 50 people,” he
said yesterday. ’

Staff and faculty can
talk with representatives
of Unum, Pitt’s Human
Resources ofﬁce and the
University’s dental and
vision care insurers at a
beneﬁts fair today, noon-2
p.m., in ZK56 Posvar
Hall.

Just because employees
missed the April 30 deadline
doesn’t mean they can’t enroll
in the future, even after July
1, the date the plan goes into
effect here. But they will have to
complete medical questionnaires
and could be rejected by Pitt’s
long-term care insurer, Unum
Life Insurance Co. of America.

In the future, new staff and
faculty who meet “guarantee
issue” standards would be auto-
matically accepted into the plan
if they enrolled within 60 days
of their hiring dates.

However, current staff and
faculty who do not now qualify
as “guarantee issue” employees
(such as part—time, untenured

faculty ‘and staff working less

than 18.75 hours per week) but
who later meet those standards
—— say, through ‘promotions to
full—time status — would not
gain “guarantee issue” status
and would be required to ﬁll
out medical questionnaires, said
Edgerton.

Also eligible for group rates
through the University’s long-
term care plan (although they

-must complete questionnaires

and could be rejected for cov-
erage) are: Pitt retirees, and
staff/faculty members’ spouses,
adult children, siblings, parents
(including in—laws) and grand-
parents (including a spouse’s
grandparents) ages 18 to 80.
Unum’s questionnaire
includes, among other things,
several “knockout” questions, as
Edgerton called them — mean-
ing that applicants are ineligible
for coverage if they answer

“ es” to an of them. Questions‘
Y Y

include:

0 “Do you use mechanical
devices such as a wheelchair,
a walker, quad-cane, crutches,
hospital bed, dialysis machine,
oxygen or stairlift?” 1

0 “Within the last ﬁve years,
have you received medical advice,
been diagnosed or treated by a
member of the medical profes-

Unum also will reject HIV-
infected applicants and people
with Lou Gehrig’s disease, mul-
tiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s
disease. But Unum will not
automatically exclude applicants
with histories of cancer and
heart disease. The full ques-
tionnaire can be downloaded
from: www.unumprovident.com/
enroll/upitt.

Like Pitt’s dental and vision

plans, the long-term care plan
will be employee-paid. It will cost
the University nothing except
for administrative expenses.

An individual’s monthly cost
would depend on the person’s

.age and coverage choice. The
younger a person is when the

insurance is purchased, the lower
the cost. Once an employee or
family member buys into the
plan, his or her rate is locked in
as long as payments continue to
be made. Rates will not go up as
participants age. ’ ‘
Minimum coverage will be
for $1 ,O00 per month for one year
in a nursing home. Maximum

coverage will be for $6,000'per'

month (with periodic inﬂation
adjustments) for nursing home
care as well as total home care,
for an unlimited period.
