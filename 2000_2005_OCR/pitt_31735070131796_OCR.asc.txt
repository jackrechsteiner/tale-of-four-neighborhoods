One of America is greatest student newspapers — since 1906

Students react,

Although students have scram-

bled for basketball season tickets’

the past two years, student atten-
dance at games has been low, aver-
aging 763 out of a possible 1,400
seats. ‘
Wednesday night, students rec-
ommended ways to fix the problem.
Erik Frazier, a student at Pitt,

" suggested that tickets sell for $150.

For every game a student attends,
he proposed, a refund ‘would be
issued. If a student attended all the
games, the season tickets would
still cost $35 — the current price.
About 50 students headed to the
Petersen Events Center Wednesday
night to take part in an open athlet-

ic forum, organized by Pitt’s athlet-

ics department ’ and Student
Government Board. Students were
allowed to offer suggestions and
respond ‘to ‘ideas proposed by a
panel of athletics officials and SGB
members A 5

Jim Earle, “Pitt’s associate ath-
letics director of marketing and
merchandising, described the prob-
lems the athletics department faces
when trying to fill seats at basket-
ball games.

“We have students who buy
tickets, who don’t show up,” Earle
said. “We’ve had tickets on sale‘
every single game.”

Earle answered most of the
questions addressed‘ to the panel,
stressing that none of the panel’s
suggestions are official.

“We’re by no means advocating
it; it is just an idea,” Earle said of
an idea to create a football ticket
upgrade system, which would allow
students with football season tickets
to bring friends. “Everything we
have tried to do has been in the
interest of our students.”

Brent Healy, vice‘ president of
public relations for Panther Pitt,

Group urges Rep. Hart to help close WHISC

uates who use terroristic tactics toward unionists

Staff Writer

Local activists are urging Rep. Melissa Hart,
R—4th District, to co-sign legislation that would
officially close the Department of Defense’s

Western Hemisphere Institute for Security

Cooperation, a training facility for Latin
American military personnel. _

About 10 activists, mainly members of the
Western Pennsylvania School of the Americas
Watch, picketed Downtown outside of ‘One
Oxford Center Thursday evening, where Hart was
speaking in the Rivers Club.

WHISC, formerly known as the School of the
Americas, has been criticized as producing grad-

and humanrights activists in theirhome coun-
tries. ,  __ _ -
Although -the school underwent formal
changes in 2001 in response to these criticisms,
the only thing that has changed is the name, said
Chad Skaggs, 22, a member of WPA-SOAW.

Although WHISC now says that they teach '
human rights classes, Skaggs said the SOA also _
taught human rights classes, but still produced-
graduates -who murdered, raped and tortured oth-

ers who spoke out against trade and economic
agreements with the United States.
As of now, about 25 percent of Congress has

signed legislation that would close WHISC,

Skaggs said. -

But Hart, who gave a speech on Latin—

America on Thursday,has not co—signed the legis-
lation.

“It doesn’t seem as though she has Latin
Americans’ interests at heart,” said Serena

-Spenser, another WPA-SOAW member.

WPA-SOAW, a 4-year-old organization within
the Thomas Merton Center, is a grassroots group
formed for the specific purpose of non-violently
protesting the SOA, and now WHISC.

Spenser became involved in the movement

against WHI-SC after she taught an English as a .

second language class at Pitt.

70 years behind bars—and two of hiskids followed

NICK ULINTZ
Staff Writer

On a clear April night in 1933, a small crowd
began eyeing up a beer truck parked outside of a
small grocery store and soda fountain shop in
what is now Allegheny Center. The clock tower
of the Carnegie Library struck midnight, prohi-
bition ended, and a young bartender’s career
began. .

Angelo Cammarata, a 19-year-old working in
his father’s grocery store, had no idea bartending
would become his lifelong career.

“I just put a case [of beer] on the soda foun-
tain bar and started selling it for 10 cents a bot-
tle,” Angelosaid.

Seventy years and a world record later,
Angelo is still behind the bar. The Guinness
Book of World Records named Angelo the
longest—working bartender in the world on Jan.
9, 1999.

“It was sleeting and snowing, but we were
jammed. All the neighbors knew about it and
came down. It was a great honor for me,”_Angelo
recalled while standing behind the bar and wip-
ing out a glass.

“It’s great, because he didn’t have to do any-
thing stupid, like eat the most bugs, to get in [the
Guinness Book of World Records]. He justigets
up and goes to work and is being recognized for
it,” said Frank Cammarata, Angelo’s son, who
works with him in the bar.

Angelo is also recognized for pouring more
Iron City and Budweiser beers than anyone else
in the world. v

From the outside of Cammarata’s i_Ca.fe,7
- West View, one would never guess it is the ‘home
. and business of the world’s longest-serving_bar-

tender. The family moved into an apartment
above the bar in 1954 and will soon be celebrat-
ing their 50th year in the Pittsburgh bor'o1fg’h. ’
“It took a while to get used to the ijujkebox
and people singing till two in the m_'orIiir1_'g!,”
recalled Frank Cammarata, who was fi-vemyears
old at the time.   1

Sunday, Feb. 15

-11:01 a.m. — Police cited vehicles
parked where prohibited by signs.
The vehicles were towed to
Stuckert’s.

Inside of thebar, a collage of plaques, news-
paper clippings and pictures commemorates
Angelo and the various people in his life. A sign
on the wall next to the pool table reads, “No
Gambling and No Swearingz” It serves to rein-
force the family atmosphere Cammarata tries to
maintain in the bar.

“He is a hardworking man and runs’ a clean
business,” said Frank Calore, a barber who has
been friends with Angelo for 45 years. “You
don’t go over there to get out of hand — you go
there to socialize.”

Cammarata’s Cafe has always been a local
bar serving the community. Angelo plays the role

of psychologist, businessman and friend while‘

behind the bar, and he said he always knows the

names and drinks of everyone who frequents his

establishment. '
The City of Pittsburghdeclared April 7 to be

Angelo Cammarata Day’ to honor his first day on

the job.

“It was amazing. I couldn’t believe it hap-
pened,” Angelo said.

Angelo still does much of the daily mainte-
nance at the bar. At 89 years old, he said he still
is not afraid to do things himself.

“He’s always fixing something, always stays
active,” said Calore.

Though he may be a regular bartender,
Angelo does not keep regular bartending hours.
His day usually starts at 11 a.m., when he opens
the bar, and ends around 1 p.m., when his sons
arrive and take over.

He also comes down to relieve his sons for

. an hour at dinnertime, so they can eat with their
‘families.’   ' '

years, Angelo kept up with his trade.

“I still worked weekends and kept at it,’7
Angelo said.

In addition to bartending, Angelo collects T-
shirts. ’ A

“I always tell people to send shirts here, and
I send them one in return,” he‘ said. 1

During‘”the years, he has acquired shifts from

all over the world, often from people calling him ,

for interviews. He has received shirts from Rosie
O’Donnell, Jay Leno and Augustus Busch,
among others. ,. ‘
But his favorite shirts tend to be the ones
with his name on them. ’ V —

Angelo said he is very proud of his family ‘ \

name and the family that goes along with it. He

devotes every Sunday to his family, choosing to v

keep the bar closed"-— except during the Super
Bowl.

Two of his four children work with him at the

bar every day.

V “You gotta respect those kids who stepped in
to follow in their father’s footsteps,” Calore
said. .

But as far as Angelo is concerned, his bar is

a good way to mix family and business. There '

are just as many, pictures of his children and

grandchildren, decorating the walls of the bar, as V

there are of him. _
Angelo has received accolades from every-

one from the president of the United Statesto the
_ president of Bartender Monthly.

“We’re -very lucky to have such an icon right

the issue.

In 2000, Spenser was detained,
along with 1,700 others, after pickete

Recently, another WPA-SOAW

ing onto the property. ‘ 1

He has since been found guilty I

and will be serving a three—month

Survil said. ‘

Although there are many schools

“The U.S. trains people from all

According to Spenser, the U.S.

“We’re bigger, we’re badder  and,
in fact, we’ll train your people to

- Although the average American
may think that the issue of WHISC
does not affect him or her, he should

said.

Earle: Athletics department not looking to make profit off students

Forum, page 1

seating areas at football games.

“You would have people in stu-
dent seating not cheering for Pitt,”
said Healy, whose student organiza-
tion is trying to unite students at
Heinz Field into a cheering section
similar to the Oakland Zoo, the bas-
ketball studenttrsection. ,

“It would be a detriment to the
fan base,” Healy added.

Brian Kelly, SGB president,
introduced the topics and moderated
the discussion between students and
the panel, which also included
Jason Heggemeyer, director of sales
and ticketing; Matt Hutchinson,
SGB member; and Pitt po1ice_ Chie
Tim Delaney. -

Delaney brought up another
issue regarding the problems with
creating a unified student section.

“What do you do with someone
rooting for the other team?”
Delaney asked.

Kelly offered his own solution.

“Give them some body gear,” he
replied. .

Delaney asked the audience fo .

suggestions to improve the crowded
quarters of the student lot at Heinz
Field, but he admitted that there
will always be a large number of

people at the tailgate events.

“It’s football. I_t’s a college
game; it’s a student event; it’s the
place to be,” Delaney said.

Some students suggested allow-
ing oversized vehicles, which many
students use for tailgating, to park
in a separate lot. - _

Others advised making students
pay a nominal fee to reserve a space
in the student lot.

Earle stressed that money was
not an issue," since construction at
Heinz Field has limited the total
number of spaces available.

“It’s not a revenue issue. We
just want you to have fun,” Earle
said.

Delaney cited progress in con-
trolling the amount of garbage left
on the lot, thanks to officers,
including him, handing out garbage
bags to tailgaters.

“You’re teaching the
responsibility,” Delaney

kids
said.

“Sometimes students come to tail-

gate without being prepared.”

The distribution of basketball
season tickets was another major
topic, as both the panel and the stu-
dents devised ways to make the sys-
tem fairer — and to make sure that
students who really want tickets can
receive them. 

“You’ve got to raise the ticket
price,” said Bob Bagaley, ajunior at
Pitt. “It’s supply and demand, like
we learned in school.”

Earle repeatedly stated that the
athletics department’ does not seek
profit from student ticket sales.

. “We’ve never looked at our stu-
dent ticket sales as a source of rev-
enue,” Earle said. ‘ . -

Someone suggested that a par-’

tial solution (to this problem would
be to sell the season tickets in two
sets, one for games held during stu-
dent vacations, and one for games
held on normal days. '

“I completely agree that games
held over break should be separate,”
Kelly said. Student attendance at
basketball games during student
vacations is considerably lower than
it is while school is in session.

‘A The subject of student campouts
was brought up as a way to make
sure that only students who are seri-
ous would get tickets.

Kelly was open to the idea, but
not as a regular occurrence at Pitt.

“I think one sponsored, safe
campout would be fine,” Kelly said.

Earle emphasized that the num-
ber of students at Pitt complicate
ticket sales, and that activities like
scalping, or selling tickets" off the

street for an inflated price, are
extremely difficult to stop.

“There are some issues that are
impossible to solve to everyone’s
satisfaction,” Earle said.

Kelly appreciated the feedback
from the students who attended, but
he said he was disappointed that
there was not a largerturnout.

“I wish we had a few more stu-

dents,” Kelly said. “The ones who

were here were great.” I

Kelly cited SGB attempts to
draw as many students as possible
to the event. The organizers mailed
announcements to all season ticket
holders, posted signs in the Towers
Lobby, and notified the Greek com-
munity. I

“We reached out to literally
thousands of people,” Kelly said. “I
really don’t think there was much
more we could have done.” ‘

Healy said heappreciated the
attempts of the athletics department
to reach out to students. ,

“The athletics department is

willing to sacrifice profit for stu-
dent enjoyment,” Healy said, citing
the many cameras around the room
as proof of commitment by the
department. ,

“It really, does show that they
were listening,” he said.

. . ‘EDITORIAL

Barnett should be removed, without pay

At some schools, if you make inap-
propriate remarks, you get a paid vaca-
tion.

University of Colorado’s football
coach Gary Barnett has been placed on
leave with pay for comments made about
a former kicker for the team

Barnett’s comments concerned Katie
Hnida, a former Colorado player, who
recently came forward about allegedly
being raped by her teammate four years
ago, but who is not pressing charges.

Barnett remarked on her abilities as a
player. He stated that, “[she was] not only
a girl, she was tenible,” and “awful.”

But Barnett claims that his comments
were taken out of context.

Whatever their context, these com-
ments are totally out of place, given the

-seriousness of the allegations against the

team. «
Already, Richard Tharp, the CU ath-
letic director, issued ‘a statement dissociat-
ing Bamett’s comments from CU, calling
them “insensitive” and saying that they
“do not reﬂect the athletic department’s
commitment to ... female athletes.”

The question remains: Why is __

Barnett still on CU’s payroll? His conduct
was not beﬁtting a coach, and he should-
n’t be employed at CU. .

CU Chancellor Richard Byyny has
said that an interim head coach will be
named. : "

Since we at Pitt know a bit about
interim athletics positions, we can offer

some advice to CU: No matter who is
named, it should be made clear that he or

she is Bamett’s permanent replacement.»

Even if every charge is cleared, and every
allegation proven false, there is no excuse
for what he said. ‘

If this seems‘ like a hasty dismissal of

Barnett, consider his comments.from a, i

statement released by the Boulder police.
In it, a woman said that Barnett had told
her that he would “back his player 100
percent” if rape charges were brought
against the player.

It would be one thing for him to agree
to treat the charges seriously, to seek the

truth behind the allegations and to, while '

standing behind his team, tell the worn
she would have the full cooperation of the
university. Clearing the university and
players’ names would be the best way of

dismissing charges, rather than dismiss-’

ing them without investigation.

But he did none of that, which CU
President Elizabeth Hoffman publicly
criticized him for. Barnett also failed to
back another one of his players — Hnida,
whomay be a “girl,” but was still a foot-
ball player —' 100 percent, when she
came forward.:Hnida has nothing to gain
from coming forward; she only wants to
reexamine CU’s football policies, which
clearly needs to be done. _

Barnett should no longer be in CU’s
employ; his comments tarnish the good
players’ names, and bring further shame
to a troubled team.

Here’s a shocker: The City of
Pittsburgh is broke.

Not the kind of broke that causes a
major metropolitan industrial city to
file for ﬁnancial distress. No no, this
broke is far greater than that.

On the top of the official City of
Pittsburgh Web site, promi-
nently displayed in the mid-
dle of the screen’ Where
important “City News” is
listed, there is ,a link that
reads: _

“City Boat Sale — Ever
dream of having your own
boat? The City has a 1991
Rinker Fiesta Cruiser with a .
30-foot hull for sale ...”

This is not an-ad. This is
not a joke. The City of
Pittsburgh is selling a used
two—cabin boat.

It gets better — when you click the

‘link, it goes to a .pdf file that looks like
a cheesy ﬂier you would see on a tele— .

phone pole. Check it out —. it’s actual-
ly kind of funny. .

You’d think the city boat would b
a little nicer, but hey, when Mayor Tom
Murphy is in charge ..’.

Mind you, auctioning off city assets
is a common practice when cash ﬂow is
needed. However, the fact that selling
said boat is so important that it occupies
top placement on the city’s home page
shows the city is in serious need to
make some cash. _

‘I guess when you’re as broke as the
City of Pittsburgh, the ﬁrst thing that
goes is the city boat.

It’s sort of like when John Kerry,’
who claims he is in touch with the com-
mon man, mortgages the Kerry-Heinz
family art collection to raise cash for
his presidential campaign (according to
newsmax.com). I know when I’m short
at the end of the month, the first thing I

the wall, dust it off, and mortgage it to
pay for my Veracruz burrito.

But short cash ﬂow aside, the city’s .

mismanagement has gotten to the point
that our city is in complete financial

turmoil. Half the city’s salt trucks are‘

out of commission as a
result of insufficient f1md—
ing. Garbage is piling in
the streets, and parking
rates are so high that
they’re forcing employees
and employers to move out
. of the city.
Recently, when the city
was holding hearings on
whether or not to raise the
parking tax, _they invited
local business people to
voice their concerns. The
city council demonstrated its arrogance
to the point that they cut off speakers,
and soon attendees realized that the
council had already made its decision
on the tax hike.

Ladies and gentlemen, I can no
longer sit idly by and watch my dear
city stay on this crash course into the
deepest depths of Hell. Instead, I am
going to be active.

This column is my official notice
that I plan to run for mayor of the City
of Pittsburgh.

I’m being serious — if enough peo-
ple endorse me, I will do it.

The mayor’s term ends in 2006.
This gives my supporters and me about
a year and a half to put together an
agenda. All I ask is you e—mail me at the

I get enough responses, I’ll seriously do
this.

Why am I a good candidate? Well,

Wanted: one old friend, racquetball racquet not required

A little over a year and a half ago, I loaned a
good friend ‘of mine my racquetball racquet. I
haven’t played much racquetball since. This could
be considered a good thing by some, seeing as I
play racquetball almost as well as I sing. For those
of you who have heard me sing — you know what
I’m saying.

This doesn’t mean I wouldn’t like
to play every once in a while, though.
I don’t really care if I’m making a fool
out of myself, as long as I have a good
time doing it. I

The singing thing comes as an
exception to this rule. My voice has a
direct impact on anyone within
earshot. Being the sympathetic person
that I am, I’m doing a service to soci-
ety by confining my vocal perfor-
mances to my car and the shower.

But I like to switch up my work-
outs here and there, and some good .
old-fashioned competition is always welcome -
especially for a person who has spent her entire life
involved in athletics.

I’ve asked repeatedly for the safe return of my
racquet. And when I say “my racquet,” I really
mean “my sister’s.” The first couple months of its
disappearance went unnoticed.

I, for one, am not a prime example of returning
efficiency.

I’m convinced my picture hangs behind the
Blockbuster counter under the heading “Wanted!” I
couldn’t receive my report card in high school until
I forked over twenty smackers in late fees, and I
just found a pair of pajama pants that belonged to a

friend of my sister’s who has since moved to
Alaska. .

Track record aside, I really wanted my racquet
back, but I certainly understood its delayed home-
coming. '

Once my patience wore thin and I had to start
turning down invites to play due to lack of equip-
ment, I started inquiring about the location
of my racquet.

One of my friend’s true talents is
his uncanny ability to make me, and my
inquisition, seem like the real pains in the
ass ‘_— not the fact that he failed to return
it. .

The_more ‘I persisted, the more he
made me feel like the nagging mother, a
role I never wish to play and make a con-
scious effort to avoid.

As time wore on, with a mix of guilt
and feeling‘ like a nuisance, I gave up on
trying to regain my racquet.

Over the same span of time, I had less and less
contact with my former friend.

The lack of contact has no direct correlation
with the fact that my friend likes to hang onto, my
stuff. “Sometimes people just grow apart,” I’ve
been told.

This is not an explanation I accept easily. I’m
not much of bridge-bumer.

,In fact, I can’t think of one person I’ve encoun-
tered in my life with whom, if forced to be left
alone in a room with them, I couldn’t manage to
make civil conversation and fake a smile.

Many of my friends date all the way back to our
elementary school days. '

 

Regardless of any bad blood from the past, I’ve
remained close with my_crew of gals from good, 01’
Tower A back from freshman year.

It’s quite possible that I have some loyalty com-
plex stemming from something that occurred dur-
ing my childhood,‘ where I get attached and can’t
seem to let people go. I_don’t know; I’m not a psych
major. ,

I do know that it drives me nuts that someone
can so easily cut me out. I realize that I can effort-
lessly annoy the hell out of anybody.

My laughing fits, to which I seem to be partic-
ularly prone, could annoy the likes of Mother
Theresa.

And while I’m typically a pretty levelheaded
person, I have my moments of sheer irrationality.
Thank God those times are few and farbetween. All
things considered, I think that everyone has their
little moments and quirks — and that’s the stuff that
makes people unique and fun. _

I don’t think people should apologize for the

characteristics that make them who they are. After

all, variety is the spice of life.

And maybe, sometimes, people’ do just grow
apart, and I need to learn to accept this and let the
pieces fall where they may. But for me, it’s so much
easier to just get along and embrace personality dif-
ferences then it is to pretend to dislike someone and
ignore him as you pass each other on Forbes
Avenue. ,

Really, all I want is my racquetball racquet
back — and perhaps my good friend, too.

“yinz” if prompted, eating chipped-
chopped ham and bleeding black, gold and
ketchup, I have a few ideas on how to run
this city with common sense and responsi-

bility.

For one thing, I know that you can’t ,

tax a city into prosperity. I know that you
have to legitimately listen to citizen’s con-
cerns and complaints. I also know that
when you have messed up, you at least
admit to it instead of complaining that it’s
everyone else’s fault.

So join me in my quest to take
Pittsburgh back from the political machine
that has crippled this city. Join me in my
ﬁght to make Pittsburgh great again.

taxation!

Pitt wasting its potential

Dear Editor,

I am writing regarding the_

article, “Pittsburgh: the green-
est city.” While it’s exciting to
Pittsburgh has
cleaned up its act, I cannot
help but wonder where our
University fits into this story.

For example, the other two
major universities in
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon
and Duquesne, use 5 percent
wind energy and have great
programs. .

"Meanwhile, Pitt’s adminis-
tration cringes at the thought
of spending any extra money
for sustainable practices, lack-
ing the" foresight of long-term
benefit from a sustainable
campus. A

Last year, a representative

from Wind Energy Inc., the
local wind energy supplier,
came for three days to talk

with Pitt about purchasing a
small amount of wind energy.
He was completely ignored by
Pitt’s energy representative.
Also, while recycling in resi-
dence halls has improved,
recycling in academic build-

_ings is almost nonexistent, to

name a few wasteful problems.

The students, staff and fac-
ulty of Pitt need to stand up
and let the bureaucracy know
that we won’t fall behind other

universities and the city ‘in
doing out part for a sustainable.-

community.
Pitt is one of the top uni-

versities in the nation, but it is _

quite literally wasting its
potential. I

Franken talks comedy and balls of steel  

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

Al Franken knows smart, edgy, political
comedy — he’s been doing it for more than
30 years. From 1975 until 1980, Franken
wrote for and performed on “Saturday Night

Live,” winning four Emmys for writing and _
‘a ﬁfth for producing. In 1985, he retumed to

“ NL” for another 10 years, often portray-
ing hypersensitive self-help guru Stuart
Smalley.

In 1996, his book “Rush Limbaugh is a
Big Fat Idiot, and Other Observations” spent

ﬁve weeks at the top of the New York‘

Tunes’ best-sellers list and got Limbaugh on
a treadmill. He followed with 2000’s “Why
Not Me,” a fictional account of his presiden-
cy and 2002’s “Oh, the Things I Know,”
anoﬂrer poke at the self-help industry.

He is currently touring behind his latest
best-seller, “Lies and the Lying Liars Who
Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the
Right.” A Fox lawsuit and a spat with Bill
O’Reﬂly at what may have been the most
exciting book convention ever have brought
it mucho recognition. He will be at Carnegie
Music Hall on Saturday night for a ﬁmdrais-
er for Jewish life on campus. ’

Despite his busy schedule, Franken

found time to speak with The Pitt News T

about _politics, comedy, Judaism and John
Keny’s balls of steel.‘ ' -

Your comedy, especially your books, is
very political. How powerful a tool is
political comedy in inﬂuencing society?

I hope it is very powerful, because I
want to have a lot of inﬂuence [laughter],
especially this election cycle. I think we real-
ly have to get rid of this guy.

Do you have faith that we will?
I don’t have faith that we will, but I
think that we can.

War, terrorkm and a lot of very unfunny

' things have been in the ‘national spoﬂight

recently. How has that changed your
approach to political comedy?

I’ve always believed that you can do
comedy about ﬂiings that are very serious,

and I’ve always had trouble explaining that

to certain people sometimes, like the censors

I at NBC [laughter].tI don’t think there is any-

thing‘ inherently contradictory about doing
humor about serious things if you treat them
right, if you have the right-attitude, and if
you’re honoring the seriousness about the
thing you’re talking about and people know
where you are coming from. Sometimes
you’ll offend people who want to be olfend-

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

umbrage at anything you say about anything
important. They think that, by ﬂre nature of
comedy, you are trivializing something, and
tl1at’s not true at all. I think that satire is very
often about serious things, things that are not
necessarily happy. Happy . and laughing
aren’t the same thing.

In your latest book, you seem pretty
angry and upset about a lot of things,
.especially the president’s environmental
policies. Is it hard to be funny When you
are angry?
Idon’tthink so. Ithinkthat anger canbe
a fuel thatcan be Sublimated into humor and
often has been throughout history. Satire
very often is about that. I don’t consider
myself a terribly angry person or a person
that hates people. I don’t hate President
Bush. I just hate everything he does and

everything about him, but I don’t hate him.

That’s sort of a waste of energy. But I think

that it is worth getting angry about I just
went on a [United Service Organizations]
tour. to Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan and
Uzbekistan. It was my fourth USO tour. I
love our troops, and I’m angry that we got
into this war by being misled about weapons
of mass destruction. I’m angry that we did-
n’t~ get a real coalition to bear the burden
with us, especially in terms of troops. And
then I see our young men and women there
who are my kids’ ages, and it makes me
angry that ﬂreyare the ones who are in
harm’s way, because we failed diplomatical-
ly. I also think they are in harm’s way
because [the Bush administration] did not
plan for the aftermath of the invasion and for
the occupation like they should have. I think
they willfully ignored the planning, and

that’s very well documented in a. recent
James Fallows article in the Atlantic
Monthly: That makes me mad, because it’s
life and deaﬂr for these guys.

In ‘ 'es,” you said that you initially sup-
ported the war in Iraq and spoke in favor
of the -War on an affiliate of Clear
Channel Communications. Why did you
initially support the war and What
changed yourmind?

Some people think I did the Clear
Channel thing; I really didn’t do that. I was
ambivalent about the war and very tom-up
about it. I had a very difﬁcult time a year ago.
trying to ﬁgure out how I felt about it. When

' I saw Colin Powell, at the [United Nations],

lay out his evidence of mass destruction, I
felt there deﬁnitely were weapons of mass

4 destruction. I believed him, because I

respected Colin Powell enormously.
However, I feel in retrospect that that was
probably the lowest day in his career.

Bill O’Reilly recently apologized for his
statements about weapons of mass
destruction and going into the war. Were
you surprised?

Well, no; I think he boxed himself in.
He basically said that,  they don’t ﬁnd

‘ weapons of mass destruction, I will apolo-

gize and say I will not trust the president
anymore.” In fact, I think he kind of
weaseled out a little bit by blaming the intel-
ligence that the president got and blaming
[CIA director] George Tenet While, in real-
ity, a lot of that intelligence came straight

from the Pentagon and was stove-pipedato 9

the White House without going to the CIA
It was from the Office of Special Plans, and
they got it directly from those guys. So I
think the story was more complicated ﬂran,
as usual, Bill O’Reilly lets out in terms of
what this administration is doing to mislead
and massage intelligence.

As someone who has taken on the right
wing, What advice would you give the
next Democratic candidate about going
on the oifensive?

Go on the offensive. Don’t back off.
Don’t be divisive, but, on the other hand,

Half—boy, half—bat   .
should stay intabloids

Bat Boy: The Musical

Starring: Matthew Scott, Meg
Pryor, Scott B. Sambuco, Lydia
Burns

Directed by: Jennifer Ewing
Pierce

7i‘r72r‘l/2

He’s peered at you for years in

the supermarket checkout line, and '
-the Weekly World News has covered

his exploits religiously. ‘

“Bat Boy Found in Cave.” “Bat
Boy Escapes Lab.” “Bat Boy Leads
Troops to Saddam Hussein.”

Bat Boy has gotten around. And
in the process, the big—eyed, bald-
headed half-man, half-bat -has
worked his way into the hearts and
minds of millions.

His travels have now led him to
the stage, where “Bat~Boy — The
Musical” proves two things:-Bat
Boy works best as a tabloid head-
line, and Bat Boy only works in
small doses.

In the play, Bat Boy (Matthew
Scott) is found in a West Virginia
cave by three miners. After biting
one of theminers — presumably
because the miners ‘offered Bat Boy
a bag of Fritos — Bat Boy is taken
prisoner and brought topside. Once

- there, he’s taken to the home of

prominent Veterinarian Dr. Thomas
Parker (Scott B. ,.Sambuco) for a
quick destruction. _
But his wife Meredith (Meg
Pryor), then‘ later his daughter

Shelly (Lydia Burns), take pity on

poor Bat Boy. They take it upon
themselves to teach him the ways of
thevworld, refine him and make him
more man than bat. When all is said

2 and done, Bat Boy is a proper lad,

complete with a British accent —
the moment in the play when
Meredith remarks that the BBC lan-
guage tapes are helping Bat Boy’s
speech and Bat Boy; replies,

“Indubitably,” is oneof the funniest

moments in the show. V

Despite Bat Boy’s major strides
from animal to, human, most of the
townsfolk still hate him, blaming
him for a plaguekilling their cows
and ‘the incurab_le illness of the
miner whom Bat Boy bit. This anger,
horror and misunderstanding fuel
the conflict of the musical, which

builds toran “unholy” climax that,
while funny, is fairly unsatisfying.
It’s in the plot that the show’s

~major problems arise. There are

some funny moments and characters
—- Doug Pona, who looks like Rev.
Al Sharpton, playing a revivalist
minister, is inspired casting. But the
majority is like a really boring, long-
winded joke. Some overacting is
responsible for this reaction — think
of some guy telling a really awful

' joke‘really loudly because he thinks

it’s the best joke ever, and you have
a good idea of what,‘ most of this
show’s like. And it becomes fairly
grating pretty quickly.

That said, though, there are pos-
itives. The production design is
interesting in that it keeps most of
the sets and costumes a neutral gray,
giving the stage the black and white

feel of reading an issue of the_

Weekly World News.

Similarly, there area few musi-
cal numbers that are excellent. One
is in the second act, “Children,
Children.” During this number, a
god of the forest — like someone
out of “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream” — calls out to all the ani-
mals, which are played by actors in
costume, and they start getting it on.
The other opens and closes the show.
“Hold Me Bat Boy” is a catchy,

almost infectious song that you’ll V

find yourself humming and singing
for days after you’ve seen the pro-
duction. And with lyrics like “Hold
your Bat Boy/Touch your Bat Boy,”

the show ends on a high, uproarious —

note.

The other appeal of the show is
Matthew Scott. His Bat’ Boy is a
funny, touching character that he
takes from shrieking and drooling to
upright British—ness with ease. He’s
fun to watch and pulls you into the
show. This is nice in those low
moments where the audience is on
the cusp of being lost thanks to the
drab plot.

“Bat Boy — The Musical” is a
show that anyone with a love of the
character or the Weekly World News
would have high hopes for.
Unfortunately, these hopes aren’t
met. It’s a show worth seeing-, but it
doesn’t do justice to one of the most
inspired characters of the late 20th
Century.

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
A&E Editor

Sitting in on the dress rehearsal for this
weekend’s production of ‘The Vagina
Monologues” was more than a little intim-
idating. Perhaps this was because I was the
only man amidst nearly 30 women all
focused on a body part I don’t have.

In two large, connected lecture halls in
David Lawrence Hall, around 25 women
on stage recite funny, and sometimes har-
rowing and sobering, stories about

women’s experiences. The most moving of ’

these deal with violence — emotional,
physical and psychological — against
women. Even though the women on stage
are speaking to a phantom audience, prac-
ticing for the real deal, it makes the horrors
of the worst stories of crimes Committed
against women resonate much more
strongly when you’re the only man — and
only non—participant of the show — in the
room.

Despite this initial discomfort, watch-
ing ‘The Vagina Monologues” and listen-
ing to the stories in the show cause you,

especially if you’re a man, to consider,
strongly, seriously and honestly, the state of
this world.

How could anyone who calls himself
a man take a bottle of acid to a ‘woman’s
face? What would possess a man to beat
and ravage his loving wife? Who do these
people think they are, calling themselves
men?

These are questions that pound
through the heart and soul while listening
to these true stories of abuse and violence.

For those unfamiliar with “The Vagina
Monologues,” it’s a show put together by
Eve Ensler after hearing many, many testi-
monials from women, some of whom have_
suffered from abuse. Some are from
women who have been all but killed by the
brutality’ of acid-wielding husbands —
recounted in the three—woman perfor-
mance discussing atrocities in Islamabad,
Baghdad and Juarez, Mexico — and some
are humorous takes on sexual awakening
— the best of these is the -show—stopping
performance of ‘The Little Coochie
Snorcher That Could,” a piece that is per-
formed wonderfully and must be seen to be
believed.

. All are affecting, no matter how funny
or horriﬁc. ,

But co-director Crystal Sickles wants
people to come to the show for the positive
message of both the show itself and of the
national V—Day organization, a group cre-

ated in 1998 out of Ensler’s productions‘ of
“The Vagina Monologues.” . I

“For me, the most important thing is
the movement. V—Day has been very, very
powerful and very, very intense,” Sickles
says. “And I think that I really "want people
to take the intensity of the movement and
the intensity of the show, put them togetl1—
er, and understand that it’s a very, very pos-
itive thing. All of it The ‘Monologues’ and
V—Day; it’s all positive. It’s for a positive
cause,‘ it’s a positive experience to come,
and it’s just a good, good thing.”

Many people at Pitt agree with that
assessment. This production is the fourth
on Pitt’s campus, and, from the first perfor-
mance to this most recent one, ﬂie popular- ..
ity of the show andthe importance of the
V—Day movement, has grown exponential-
ly. \ '

' This production marks the largest cast
in any of the Pitt productions — there were
actually more women than parts, which led
to the “Vagina Testimonials” that close the
show to get as many people involved. And
the cast of 25 isn’t student—exclusive—as
long as you’re aﬁliated with Pitt, you can
participate. This time around, non—student
participants include a professor, a Pitt alum
who has come back to go to law school and
a Pitt staff member among the students in
the cast.

No matter how popular the show
becomes, however, some things don’t —

or won’t — change.’ First, all the money
goes to charity. Some of the money goes to
this year’s national charity of the V—Day
corporation, The Missing and Murdered
Women of Juarez, Mexico, and the rest
goes to a local charity chosen by the orga-
nization producing the show. In this case,
it’s the Women’s Center & Shelter of
Greater Pittsburgh. The production is
allowed to keep up to 10 percent of the
proﬁts, but it’s not required.

Another constant is what happens on
stage. “There’s a rule that you have to read
[the story] on stage; you can’t memorize
it,” Sickles says. “And you can’t change
the words, because it’s someone else’s
story. It’s a rule of the V—Day corporation
and of the author, because you’re telling
another woman’s story.” This makes for an
interesting and dynamic performance from
everyone in the cast, and it creates an alto-

. gether—original show.

._Then there’s the audience. Even

though .‘The Vagina Monologues” is a

show that has gained popularity on Pitt’s
campus and throughout the world, it’s still
a predominantly female’ audience attend-
ing these productions. Where are the guys?
It likely has something to do with that feel-
ing of being singled out as a man when
watching this show. Sickles also says that
she’s heard numerous men call the show

“sexist” -

But she’s quick to point out that it’s
not a sexist production, and it’s not some-
thing that men should feel intimidated
attending.

“I personally think it should appeal to
men,” Sickles says. “I think that the show
can teach men something. I think that it
can give them an insight. A lot of men
don’t know what it’s like to experience
violence or even go to the gynecologist.

Obviously, you get a lot more women see-

ing it. But from just a purely ideological
perspective, I think men would love it.”

And after getting over the initial dis- a

comfort with the subject of the show and
how intense it was, it’s extremely easy to
get caught up in the stories and testimoni-
als. It’s one of the more rewarding and
enlightening" experiences anyone A—- man
or woman — can get out of a theatrical
performance.

He said, “I like the guys, and they won’t ‘

Panthers take on Irish in front of sellout crowd

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

As the Pitt women’s basketball team gets set to take on
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame this Saturday, it will
experience something it hasn’t experienced all season -—- a
sold-out Petersen Events Center. ‘ I ,

“Pack the Pete” is a special event the athletics depart-
ment has organized as a way to generate more enthusiasm
for the women’s basketball program. Last year, the event
was a huge success, as the Panthers played in front of the
largest crowd ever to attend a women’s basketball game in
Pittsburgh. , »

Head coach Agnus Berenato said that the team is real-
ly looking forward to playing in front of a large home

‘crowd. .

.“I am so excited,” Berenato said. ‘Thelpeople of

Pittsburgh have done a phenomenal job responding to our
program.’T _ 

. Berenato said that although the Irish are a talented
team, it is very important for her team to play competi-
tively. Games like this are important because if the team
has a good showing; fans will be more likely to come back.
, “It‘s important for us to compete,” Berenato said. “We
have to let Pittsburgh know that ‘Pitt women’s basketball is
on the rise.” ~ V

The Panthers (6-17 overall, 2-11 Big East) will be
looking to snaptheir current nine-game losing streak on
Saturday. It’s been more than a month since theteam last
tasted victory when they defeated Seton Hall on the road
back on Jan. 14. ' .

“Notre Dame is a great team,” Berenato said. “But on
any given day, any team can win.” \

\ . .....— . _.

' eight rebounds per game this season and has had

Berenato and company are still hoping to qualify for
the Big East Tournament in March. To do ﬂiat, the team
will likely need to win at least two of its last three games,
and also hope that either Syracuse or St. John’s loses‘ the
rest of their games.

Awin against Notre Dame (16-8, 8-3) will be
far from easy. The Irish have won seven of their
last eight contests and are currently second in Big
East standings behind Connecticut.

The Irish are led by junior forward Jacqueline
Batteast, who this past Tuesday was selected as
one of 20 ﬁnalists for the 2004 Naisrnith College
Basketball Player of the Year Award.

Batteast is averaging just over 14 points and

eight double-doubles. Her 23 points and 11
rebounds were the main reason Notre Dame was
able to pull off -a win against UConn back on Jan.
13. ' '

“Batteast is a very talented player, but we just
got done facing -[UConn’s] Diana Taurasi,”
Berenato said. “It’s not about ohe player — it’s
about the team.” ‘

For the Panthers to pull off the upset, they
will need to improve their shooting accuracy. Pitt
has shot just 34 percent from the ﬁeld in its last
two contests.

“We’ve been really trying to work on shoot-_
ing percentage,” Berenato said. “And I think it’s
an experience thing.”

Berenato believes that, as the team improves,
so will the attendance at home games. She feels
that the team is a great value economically, and

Pitt’s Katie Histed drives on an opponent during agame ear-

can also be a positive inﬂuence for children.

“It’s a great venue to bring your family to,” Berenato
said. “These days, everything breaks you as far as ﬁnances
go. It’s an educational environment and sets a good exam-
ple for kids.”

Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team went into its last series of the
2003 season against Connecticut with a chance to seal a
spot in the Big East Tournament Pitt ended the season
with a 10-4 loss and was forced to head home for the
summer.

Starting today in New Orleans, head coach Joe
J ordano and his staff look to forget about last season’s dis-
appointing ﬁnish, in his seventh year as the Panthers’
head coach. This will mark the second year that the team
will completely consist of J ordano’s ‘recruited players and
could be regarded as his breakout season as coach of the
Panthers.

. Jordano’s staff includes assistant coaches Joel
Dombkowski, Dan Ninemine and newest addition Todd
Schiffauer. ‘

“We are Very pleased to add Todd to our staff,”
Jordano said. “He has great experience not only as a
coach but as a player as well. Todd will assist in all phas-
es of the program and I am looking forward to having him
with us this season.”

Pitt will look to tally more than 36 wins, which is the
plateau it has reached each of the last two years. The
school record for wins stands at 39.

The Panthers’ season begins tonight in New Orleans,
and Big East play will start on March 27 against Virginia
Tech. Conference matchups include trips to Rutgers, West
Virginia and a doubleheader scheduled in Oakland at
Trees Field against the defending champion Notre Dame
Fighting Irish. The city rivalry between Pitt and
Duquesne will also continue as they are set to play anoth-
er game at PNC Park on May 12.

“It will be a very competitive schedule,” Jordano
said. “Our players are willing to accept any challenge and
are not afraid to play against anyone. Playing a challeng-
ing schedule makes our entire team play at a_ higher
leve .”

Returning seniors, which include shortstop Bryan
Spamer, third baseman Mike Scanzano, and pitchers Nick
Evangelista and RJ. Hiser, look to carry the load and
anchor a highly regarded freshman class. _

The recruiting class was given Honorable Mention in
Collegiate Baseball Newspaper’s 21st annual breakdown
of NCAA Division I top recruiting classes that feature
seven pitchers, three inﬁelders, one outﬁelder and a
catcher.

“We have added some very talented freshmen,”
Jordano said. “Peter Parise can play almost any position,
Jimmy Negrych at second base, Tony Marciante in the
outﬁeld, in addition to a few transfers that will have an
impact.”

Inﬁelders

Just as they did in 2003, Spamer and Scanzano look
to stay put on the left side of the inﬁeld. Last year the two
seniors racked up averages of .375 and .332 respectively,
along with a combined 76 RBIs and 33 stolen bases.

A four-year started at second base, Scott Folmar
graduated last year leaving his position up for grabs
among many of the new Panther faces. Torn Cashman

’ batted .328 with six home rims and 36 RBIs as he took

over the ﬁrst base duties last season. Cashman replaced
the highly touted Brant Colamarino, and should remain
there this year to solidify the right side of the inﬁeld.
The Panthers, again, will have two quality catchers
behind the plate in returning seniors Alex Rybczak and

 Team looks to make a run at scho01—record 39 wins

Mike Zambriczki. Rybczak batted .250 last ‘year while

starting in 46 games while Zambriczki hit .205 backing»

up  11 games.

Outﬁelders ,

‘ Outﬁeld competition will be stiff this yeaf. Pitt lost‘
Stuart Rykaceski, who hit .342 last season. Sophomore
Ben Copeland, who started 49 games and hit .303, is the
only returning starter in the outfield. '

Sophomore David Cline, who saw limited action last
season, along with freshmen newcomers Mike Muzeka
and Tony Marciante, will compete for the two other out-
ﬁeld spots. Muzeka, a red shirt freshman,_ played for Lake
Mary High School in St. Ma1y’s, Fl. While Marciante
hails from nearby Connellsville, Pa. where he played at
Connellsville High School.

Pitchers
Pitt returns two senior starters who are Very capable

of being the No. 1 starter in Evangelista and Hiser;

Evangelista was selected in the 24th round‘ of [the Major
League draft by the Toronto Blue Jays, but decided to
return back to Pitt for his senior year. Last season,
Evangelista posted an 8-5 record with_ a 3.32 ERA, while
striking out 76 batters in 89.1 irmings pitched. »
“Having Nick Evangelista back is huge for us

because he typically draws the ace of our opponent’s staff. ‘

So he knows what it takes to pitch in big games and his
tremendous experience will carry us throughout the sea-
son,” Jordano said. '

Hiser, an All-Big East selection in 2002, was forced
to take a medical red shirt last season because of an injury,

Expectations

are high for

track season

RAYMOND NEWBY
Staff Writer

The men’s and women’s indoor track and
ﬁeld teams will try to turn their seasons around
this weekend at the Big East Championships in
Syracuse. 1

Struggles have marked thefirst half of the
season for the Panthers, who were slow to
recover from the long winter break.

I “I think they’ve performed reasonably
well,” said head coach Alonzo Webb said.
“And they keep getting better each week.”

The women’s team has been the stronger of
the two this season, and Webb expects them to
come up big this weekend, "hopefully placing
among the top three schools in the conference.

\ “I expect a whole lot out of the women’s
team,” Webb said. “They are a little more
advanced right now because of their depth.”

Among the athletes Webb expects to per-
form especially well are Kimberly Lyles, who
just last weekend broke the school record in the
200—meter dash, and Tamara McGill, who is
coming off a first place ﬁnish in the 60-meter
hurdles last weekend in the Penn State

Challenge Cup. .

' Webb also made note of past champions

I and how he expects them to step up.

“Amanda Walker was a Big East champion

. as .a freshman [in the shot put],” he said. “I

expect her to get back to her same level that she
had two years ago. And Marissa Dudek was an
outdoor champion in the pole vault last year as
a freshman. I expect her to compete well.”

Lyles, McGill, distance runner Maureen

McCandless and hurdler Elizabeth Bayne A all
qualiﬁed for the NCAA championships last
year, which raises Webb’s expectations for

A ' 1 them this weekend.

As. for the men’s team, Webb doesn’t have
expectations that arerquite as high, although he
believes that they have a strong chance of ﬁn-

ishing in the top half of the teams in the con— 1

ference. _ .

' “The men’s team doesn’t have as much
depth as I’d like to‘ us have going, into. the
meet,” he commented. “That will limit us at the
beginning, [but] I expect the people who are

going to be in the meet will performgprettyv

well.”

‘ In particular, Webb expects big perfor-

mances from captain Matt Brousse, who won
the polegvault event last weekend, shot—putter
Justin Clickett, who placed second last week-
end and first the weekend before, and sprinter
Troy Roberson, who finished in secondplace
in the 400—meter dash at last year’s Big East
Championships. A

I “It’s always hard to predict [how well we’ll
do] in the championships because of a lot of
different factors,” Webb said. “I think we
should do better than we did last year. I think
we should do very well.”

Pitt hopes newfaces won’t hinder 2003’s success

Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s softball team
has several new starters‘ who look to
build on last season’s plethora of
broken records.

Most important among the
records they would like to break is
last season’s record of 24.wins.

‘Two new starters who will be
forced to make an immediate impact
are freshmen starting pitchers, Laura
Belardinelli and Meghan Bostick.

Bostick attended Grapevine
High School in Colleyville, Texas
where she recorded 657 strikeouts
and led them to back-to-back region-
al championships.

Belardinelli is from Endicott,

N.Y. where she led Union—Endicott
High School to four regional cham-
pionships and -two New York state
championships. In her senior year,
she recorded an earned run average
of 0.12.

“They complement each other
well,” head coach Michelle Phalen
said. “They’re going to be tested
early.” ’

The infield features Pitt’s best

‘softball player to date, sophomore

Francesca DiMaria. DiMaria broke
several school records, while earning

All-Big East First Team and unani-
mous Big East All-Rookie Team
honors.

Asa second baseman, she set
school records by recording 54 hits
including 13 doubles, 25 walks
while scoring 40 runs to go along
with a .353 batting average. I

“She?s a really tough player,”
Phalen said. “She has a great work

ethic and she is always pushing her- -

self.”

Also starting around the dia-

mond is junior first baseman Casey
Pickard, who started all 55 games

last season batting .285, while‘

knocking in 31 runs.

At third base will be sophomore
Jen ()_’Donnell, who will see her first
collegiate action after suffering a
season—ending knee injury last year.

Freshman shortstop Sheena
Hellon, will help guard the left side
of the inﬁeld.

Hellon brings a big bat to the
Panthers with her .374 career batting
average at Cordova High School in
Sacramento, Calif.

Leading the outﬁelders this sea-
son is one of the two seniors on the
team, center ﬁelder Beth Gill. Gill
batted .226 last year in her 32 starts.

“Beth is an outstanding player
that will be expected to take charge

of the outfield,” Phalen said.

Alongside Gill will be freshman
right fielder Joey Scarf from
Humble, Texas, where she eamed
all—district honors with her high
school team.

The starting position in left ﬁeld
is still up in the air. Jessica Thomas
and Morgan Howard will battle for
the position.

Morgan is a freshman from
North Allegheny High School who
batted .307 as a senior for the Tigers.
Thomas is" a sophomore and batted
.156 in her first year of collegiate
play. ‘ ' .

Behind the plate for the Panthers
will be senior catcher Heather
Andrews.

Andrews was limited in playing
time last year for the Panthers, only
playing in 39 games and starting in
24.

“On offense, Heather will be.

expected to step up and drive in
more runs this year,” Phalen said.
Phalen is anxious for this week-
end as the Panthers kick off their
2004 schedule in Tampa, Fla. They

will start with North Carolina State

at noon on Friday. \

‘‘I’m really excited about this

year,” Phalen said. “We should break
more records.”

Red Sox and Yankeesare not as far apart as one might think 

     

    

I’m over it. I really am. if

I’m over the fact that Alex Roddguez
will be wearing the pinstiipes of the New
York Yankees this summer.

I I’m over the fact that Rodriguez was
hours away from becoming a Boston Red
Sox.

And as someone with an interest in

"the Red Sox, I’ve long been over the fact

that Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
will use money to accomplish almost any-
thing.

Now, with as much objectivity and ..

fairness as I can muster, I will break down
each team position—by—position and assess
which team has the advantage at each
location.

Catcher- Yankees catcher Jorge
Posada and Red Sox catcher Jason
Varitek are considered by most to be the
two best catchers in Major League
Baseball. While Varitek provides tough-
ness, grit and leadership, -Posada’s statis-
tics (30 home runs, 101 RBIs) are better

than Va1itek’s (25—home runs, 85 RBIs).
Advantage: Even.

‘ First Base- As much as I like
Boston’s Kevin Millar, I would be a fool
to deny that the Yankees’ Jason Giambi is
a better overall player. Last year, Millar
was good for 25 home runs and 96 RBIs.
However, Giambi, on two bad legs, belt-
ed 41 homers and 101 RBIs. Advantage:
Yankees.

Second Base- In what is the most

questionable" position for both teams,
Boston will use former Pittsburgh Pirate
Pokey Reese to replace Todd Walker,

‘ while New York will most likely play sec-

ond base by committee. Maybe the
Yankees could call. old friend Chuck
Knoblauch? Advantage: Even.

Shortstop- Inyet another close cate-
gory, the simple fact that Boston’s Nomar
Garciapaira will be entering ﬂie ﬁnal year
of his contract is enough to convince me
that he’ll have a better season than
Yankees captain Derek J eter. Factor in the
grudge he’ll be playing with to prove he’s
better than his supposed replacement,
Rodriguez, and ‘Garciaparra is clearly the
pick Advantage: Red Sox.

Third Base- While Boston’s Bill
Mueller did win the American League
batting title last year with an average near-
ly ‘.330, Rodriguez should adapt_quickly
to his new surroundings at Yankee

Stadium and have a monster year.
Considering Rodriguez is the ﬁrst player
to hit 40 or more home runs for six con-

secutive years, the move from one hitter-

friendly ballpark to another should make

for an extraordinary season. Advantage:

Yankees. 1 "
Left Field-

Boston’s Marmy

. Ramirez is one of the best RBI men in

Major League Baseball today. Rami1ez’s
37 home runs, 104 RBIs and .325 average
are better than Yankee Hideki Matsui’s 16

-homers, 106 RBIs and .287 average, and

considering Ramirez has hit more than 35
home 111118 and 130 RBIs in three of the
last ﬁve seasons,-it’s easy to see who has
the advantage.‘ Advantage: Red Sox.

Center _ Field- Boston’s Johnny
Damon and the Yankees’ Kenny Lofton
both bring the same weapons to the table.
They both can steal some bases, both are
quality leadoff men, and both are solid
defensively. Do you see any differences
between the two? Neither did I.
Advantage: Even.

RightField- I expect Boston’s Trot
Nixon to have a decent season, especially
considering the contract he recently
received to stay in Boston. However, if
Gary Shefﬁeld can put up statistics sirni—
lar to his performance last year with the

Panthers seek a No. 1 seed in NCAAs

Men, page 13

‘ The class has put together the schools all-

time winningest four-year period.

‘‘It is amazing what we have been able
to accomplish since we have been together.”
Monis said.

The Mountaineers (14-8, 6-5), mean-
while, have won three out of their last four
conference games and are making a real run
at the NCAA toumament. And a win over
the fourth—ranked Panthers would do won-
ders for their program.

“They always have been pretty good
and always seem to ﬁnd a way to win down
there,” said Jamie Dixon, Pitt’s men’s head

basketball coach. “The coaches have really
done a great job.”

West Virginia coach John Beilein is the
master of the unorthodox, instructing his
players to use every second of the shot clock
before taking a high—percentage shot; the
Mountaineers play tough, in—your—face
defense with their 1-3-1 defense and gener-
ally make life miserable for opposing teams.
West V1rginia’s squad .doesn’t win style
points, but recently, it has been winning
games. ’ .

‘Their defense is really coming togeth-
er and playing like a very experienced team
right now,” Dixon said

The game is the 165th meeting between

the two schools. Pitt has won each of the last
four contests, including two straight at the
WVU Coliseum. The game has been sold
out for weeks and is expected to be the
largest crowd in the history of Coliseum; the
previous mark was also a game between the
Panthers and Mountaineers, with a crowd of
16,704, in 1982.

“People have been talking about this
game for weeks, the rivalry is up and rolling,
and it doesn’t hurt that Pitt is ranked No.‘ 5 in
the nation,” said Debby Travinski, the ticket
manager for West Virginia University.

The game on Saturday is scheduled to
begin at 7 pm. and will be televised on Fox
Sports Net .

but will be back in action to create Pitt’s
one—two punch on the mound along with
Evangelista.

Adam Luckette, a junior lefty from
Syracuse, will return as a top reliever. Last
year, Luckette appeared in 33.2 innings
and held opposing hitters to just a .197
batting average. Senior Don Rhoten is
another solid pitcher that will have a spot

in the rotation. Rhoten posted a 3.30 .
earned run average last year as both a

starter and reliever. ”
Seniors T.J. Gomati and Jeff Bamyak
along with junior Jimmy Bllie should all

' see signiﬁcant time either starting or com-

ing out of the bullpen for the Panthers this

, season. The three pitchers combined for a

12-4 record last year in a total of 130
 pitched. ,

-“We have several other pitchers wh
will contribute and will play key roles
within our pitching staff,” Jordano said.
“With quality front line arms, the depth of
our pitching staff will undoubtedly be a
strength for this year’s team.” 7

Boston’s pitching

staff is critical
Shearouse, page 15 }

Atlanta Braves, this category shouldn’t be a

~ contest. Advantage: Yankees;

Designated Hitter- Boston’s David
Ortiz wants to play more ﬁrst base. New
York’s Bernie Williams wants to play more
center ﬁeld Both players don’t want to be
where they currently are. Each player’s pro-
ductivity will be aﬂected by how they accept
their roles in the lineup, especially 
Until then, this category is a push.
Advantage: Even.» V . I »

Pitching Staﬁ'- The Red Sox additions
of Curt Schilling and closer Keith Foulke,
combined with the Yankees’ loss of Andy
Pettitte and Roger Clemens makes this cate-
gory a no-brainer. The Red Sox have the
best pitching staif in the American League,.
if not all of baseball. Advantage: Red Sox.

There you have it. The ﬁnal tally: Red
Sox: three, Yankees: three, with four posi-
tions even. Between April 16 and the end of
the season, the Red Sox and Yankees will
meet on 19 separate occasions to determine
which team has ﬂne better lineup.

It should be a great season. \
David Sheamuse is a die-hard Red Sox fan
 will be traveling to Florida during
spring break to see them play against the
Philadelphia Phillies. He can be reached at
