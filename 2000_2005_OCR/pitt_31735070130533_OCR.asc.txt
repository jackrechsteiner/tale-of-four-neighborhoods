Editor in Chief I

. A $500 million’ fund-raising goal

. was off1cially‘announcediSaturday night

at “Launch 2000”. in the Carnegie Music
Hall before nearly 1,500 alumni, friends,
faculty and staff of the University.

But before the Saturday evening

,Cathedral of Learning and before the‘
' campus was ﬂooded with “Discovery

Weekend” signs I and open houses, Pitt

0 had already raised $356 million toward
A the goal; ‘ r

Guests were ﬁrst treated to the
African Drumming Ensemble as they
walked into the hall. A 20-foot tall
Cathedral of Learning statue stood in the
middle of the stage.

J. Wray Connolly welcomed the
audience with a pop quiz. 0

“True or false,” asked the chairman
of Pitt’s Board of Trustees, “lunch box

technology is getting better.” The audi-
ence laughed as he continued. “Parking
in Oakland is no longer a problem. Now,
be careful, this is a trick question.”

Connolly thanked the co—chairs of
the Capital Campaign, Suzy Broadhurst
and Cindi Roth as well .as. Chancellor
Mark N ordenberg and Carol Carter, vice
chancellor ' for Institutional
Advancement.

“The good news is that in this‘ room,

» you can see there" are enough people to

"fund all the programs,” Connolly said.
“The bad news is that the money is still
in your pockets.

.“We are entertaining opening bids
for naming rights to the Cathedral,”
Connolly quipped.

Pitt then presented “Discoveries of
the Past,” a video which showcased the
University’s history from the 1940s
through the 1970s. .

The chilly rain was not enough to dampen the spir-
its of the thousands gathered to see Vice President Al
Gore at Carnegie Mellon University on Friday.

“It is the rain that renews,” Gore said as he took the

stage while U2’s “Where the Streets Have No Name”-

blared. “It is the rain that washes away all our trouble.”
. The Democratic presidential hopeful wasted no time
in bringing up his Republican rival.
“You knew our opponent was already all wet,” he
said. 0 T

Gore’s presidential campaign stop was the second of 1
its kind to tour through Oakland in as manydays, com-

Gore hoped to energize his volunteer corps.

“[This] army’s going to sweep us to victory in 10
days,” he said.

As the shower passed, the crowd cheered. “The sun
is coming out on America,” he said.

Gore began by explaining to members of the audi-
ence why they should vote. A

“This race is not about me or George Bush — it’s
about you [and your family],” he said. ' . - . .

He continued by telling -audiences that the" newly
. elected president will -likely be responsible for appoint— A
ing three or four new supreme court justices. He expects
cases regarding women’s rights and racial proﬁling to
come before the court during that time. _ V '

Chancellor addresses”
State of the University

LESLIE 

Senior Staff Writer

As Pitt’s Discovery Weekend
began late Friday afternoon,
Chancellor Nordenberg beckoned a
full auditorium of potential bene-
factors to join him on a “journey of

I imagination”, through Pitt’s 213-

year history. . . .
Nordenberg’s “State of the
University Address” took the_ form
of an imaginary journey starting at
_the Cathedral of Learning. g_ g V
At the pinnacle of the speech, he
announced his and Pitt’s Board of
Trustees’ “bold” vision» for Pitt’s
future. ' L ,
“By aggressively, suppor_ting the

‘advancement of Pitt’s academic

mission, we will clearly and consis-
tently dcmonstrate that this_is one
of theifinest and most productive
universities in the world,” he said.
Nordenberg also used the
speech to remind the audience of
Pitt’s extensive history and its

notable academic and athletic
accomplishments. .
He spoke of Hugh Henry

Brackenridge, Pitt’s founder, and of

‘his dream for the University, which

in 1787, consisted of a log cabin,
five professors, and 44 male stu-
dents.

“He saw not only what was, but
what could be,” Nordenberg said.

Nordenberg also contrasted
Pitt’s first two female students,
Stella and Margaret Stein, who inte-
grated Pitt at the turn of the 20th
century, with Rebecca Hubbard, a
Pitt student who won a Marshall
Fellowship this year. _

“Simply put, we believe if we

give our students the opportunity to
become what they can be, some of
them — like Rcbecca Hubbard -
will become the best that they can
be,” Nordenberg,sai§d. _
He also mentioned _the feats of
legendary Pitt athletes John
Woodruff, Marshall Goldberg and
Tony Dorsett, and__.reminded his
audience of the coaches that helped
these athletes reach their goals. ’
Nordenberg then mentioned Pitt
professors of the past‘ and present
who continue _to shape Pitt’s future.
Nordenberg joked that if Pitt
were to,build a hall of famepfor its

outstanding professors, “it would
g-have to be a large facility,” and

“with itssize, we couldn’t begin; to
build it today.” '

I , After revealing hisand the
Board of Trustees’ vision for the

future, he referenced the new acad-
cmic center which is being built on
Forbes Avenue, as well as the reno-

_vation of the Masonic Tem_ple,,and

the construction , of"

Gardens. _ . j g
He also quoted four statistics.
Over the past; five years,

Bouquet

research funds have; increased by 50 .

percent to $350 million, undergrad-

uate applications have increased by ’

70 percent, and‘ private voluntary
contributions have increased by
more than 100 percent.

Nordenberg said that of the five
year period, “the best year was the
last year.” 0

He also spoke of Pitt spirit,
referred to Pitt’s victory over Penn
State, while the audience interrupt-
ed him with fervent applause.

' Nordenberg said that athletic

It’s not often that a college student is
wide-eyed and ﬁlled with enthusiasm on
a Friday morning. .

But, for Brian Bluming, an account-
ing major, last Friday was different.

The Pitt junior was one in an audi-
ence that ﬁlled 121 David Lawrence Hall
anticipating the arrival of Pitt alumnus
and team president and partial owner of
the Philadelphia 76ers Pat Croce.

“I met him at a 76ers game and he
was really interesting,” Bluming said
while holding a copy of Croce’s book, “I
Feel Great  and You Will Too!”

All guests at the Pitt Program
Friday

guests received a free signed copy of
Croce’s book outlining his strategies for

"SUCCESS.

But books were not the only things

‘ that Croce’ gave away at the lecture.
" Following his‘ speech he handed a
 $10,000 check to Jen Ressler, head of
‘ PPC’s executive board, for the new PPC

Endowed Book Fund. The purpose of the
fund will be to provide textbooks for stu-
dents who cannot afford them.

Because of the limited number of free

 books, many Croce fans headed to the

“Yeah, it was a pretty early morning,”
Bluming said.

Guests were given complimentary
Eat ‘N Park smiley face cookies and cof-
fee for morning sustenance, and the
Ambridge Area High School Steel Drum
Ensemble kept the audience awake as
they awaited their speaker. Audience
members were screaming, bopping their
heads and stomping theirfeet to the steel
drum beat as the band banged out songs
like Jimmy Buffet’s “Margan'taville.”

When the band stopped, Croce
walked down the aisle in a black suitand
his signature perfectly trimmed goatee.
He was greeted by a screaming crowd and
huge gold and blue balloons that climbed
the walls of the lecture hall. '

“Don’t lose that Pitt enﬂrusiasm,”
Croce yelled, “the college student that is
in you right now — don’t lose it.”

For more than an hour Croce talked
of his successes and how he reached his
goals. '

“It’s the will of the soul that decides
the goal,” he said.

After graduating from Pitt with a
degree in physical therapy and athletic
training, Croce wanted more than any-
thing to be a special trainer for the

Iron Mike returns to Pitt

MATT MILOSZEWSKI
Staff Writer

Friday at noon, nearly 200 students,
faculty and Pitt alumni came to David
Lawrence Hall to hear one of the
University’s most decorated graduates
S .
Mike Ditka is the ﬁrst Panther to be
inducted into both the pro-football and the
college football halls of fame.

Ditka graduated from the College of
Arts and.Sciences in 1961. He did not orig-
inally plan on a career in football.

“I wanted to be a dentist,” he said.

After graduating from Pitt, Ditka went
ontoplayintheNFLforatotalofll years
for ﬂre Chicago Bears, the Philadelphia
Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys.

Ditka stayed with the Cowboys as a
wide receiver’s coach after his playing days
ended. From there Ditka’s career ﬂourished,
and eventually led to a Super Bowl
Championship as head coach of the
Chicago Bears.

After leaving the Bears, Ditka started a
new career as a broadcaster. He worked for
NBC, broadcasting American Football
Conference games.

Ditka eventually left the broadcast
booth to get back into coaching. He became
the head coach of the New Orleans Saints.
He was ﬁred after three sub-par years and
one draft—day trade.

.Now Ditka ﬁnds himselfback in the
broadcast booth as an analyst on NFL
Today. During his speech, Ditka focused
on the acronym “ACE,” which he tries to

_ live by. -

Ditka believes attitude is the most
important part of life. “A good positive atti-
tude will deterrnine your altitude in life,” he
said. 0

Character is not always what people
think it is, Ditka said, explaining the mean-
ing behind letter “C.” 0

“[Character is] not what you are, but
what you stand for,” he said.

The ﬁnal letter of the acronym is E,
which stands for enthusiasm. Ditka said,
“Be true to yourself, and love yourself.”

He then highlighted several of the

heroes who have shaped his life. He called ,

one of them, Stan Musial, “the best baseball
player, ever.” Ditka said that Musial never
settled for anything, and that his consistent
effort helped him .330 every season.

He also has two heroes from the foot-
ball world. Ditka said he learned to be a
team player ﬁom Vince Lombardi and Tom
After the discussion of heroes, Ditka
read a poem, which he tries to live his life
by, focusing on looking ahead and never
being satisﬁed.

Ditka then answered questions from
the audience, when he reiterated the point
that his career now is in broadcasting.

“I’m done coaching,” he said.

Global positioning
system

Dr. Hassan Karimi envisions a
future where an in-car computer
could provide users with restaurant
information, driving directions and
reservations.

Karimi, director of Pitt’s geoin-
formatics program, explained his
program’s work at “Keeping
Track,” one of many presentations
presented to Pitt alumni as part of
Pitt’s Discovery Weekend, the kick-
off to a new fund-raising drive.

“Five years ago, no one even
knew what [Global Positioning
Systems] was,” Karimi said, hold-
ing up a small yellow box that when
activated would link to several
satellites and be able to keep track
of its bearer’s location and move-
ment. “Now everyone knows it
stands for Global Positioning
Systems and exactly what that
means.”

Work with GPS is just part of
the scope of the geoinformatics pro-
gram. Karimi demonstrated remote
sensing, a new type of 3-D large-
scale map—making, with a project a
student created that took observers
on a virtual tour of Pitt’s main cam-
pus. Karimi also presented a second
student project that used GPS to

"track a car as it drove down Fifth

Avenue with local restaurants and
campus buildings highlighted along
the way.

“Even watches are starting to be
equipped with GPS,” Karimi said.

Ken Sochats, co-director of the
Pitt’s visual information systems
center, joined Karimi in his presen-
tation. According to Sochats, VISC
worked on seven different projects
that annually bring in $2.5 million
to Pitt.

VISC’s main focus is the
Pennsylvania Technology Atlas, a
CD produced annually that maps,
county by county, the technological
resources and capabilities of
Pennsylvania.

When the atlas was first con-
ceived, Sochats said, it was sup-
posed to tell legislators what areas
were lacking the technological and
telecommunications capabilities
needed to “link” the entire state.

“All of the languagesltaught at
Pitt reﬂect the ethnic diversity that
we have in Pittsburgh,” said Claire
Siskin, director of the Language
Learning Resource Center.

Siskin went on to discuss vari-
ous aspects of the language lab.
According to Siskin, 2,000 people
visit every month to use the many
services the lab has to" offer. The
visitors are primarily students, but
anyone is welcome when space is
available. .

The language lab provides a
high—speed Internet connection, a
recording studio, a technology
workshop series, a digital computer

server and computer software for
language learning. , '

“Our newest acquisition is a
data projector,” Siskin said. “We
think it will be a marvelous teach-
ing tool.” _

The lab provides opportunities
for task—based learning. Unlike
most of the labs around campus, the
computers are not set up in rows.

“This setup seems like it would
be better for doing work and inter-
acting with the people around you,”
said Dr. Gloria Hope, an alumna of
the Pitt Nursing Program. . '

Siskin talked about the transi-
tion to the computer age. ~

“They certainly do not take the
place of language teachers,” she
said. “But they do provide individu-
alized learning.”

Computers also give control
over language input. Siskin demon-
strated this fact by playing an
excerpt from a Spanish movie on
the computer. Someone who is not
ﬂuent in Spanish would have a dif-
ficult time comprehending what
was said. The computer gives users
the option of clicking and listening
to the excerpt over and over again
until they understand it.

“The learner can hear what they
want to with a great deal of preci-
sion,” Siskin said.

_ After Siskin finished explaining
the basics of the lab, there was a
hands-on exploration of the com-
puters.

V The Virtual World Tour on the

computer takes the user into the‘

country of their choice. Some alum-
ni put on headsets as {they started to
travel. , 2

“Wow, I was in Italy last
spring,” said Hope as she explored
Web site that provides information
on each country, from how to speak
the foreign languages to where to
go to eat. v

For about 15 minutes, the alum-
ni explored everything the Web
sites had to offer. Then, they contin-
ued on with their walking tour.

“The information was phenome-
nal,” said Fran Cargotta, -Pitt
College of General Studies gradu-
ate, as she was leaving. “Everyone
has a lot of Pitt pride and this seems
like such an exciting’-‘time to be on

-the Pitt campus.”

The pouring rain didn’t stop this
screaming ‘crowd. ‘ '

More than 100 male and female pro-
testors of sexual assault and rape chanted
things like, “Join together, free our lives,
we will not be victimized,” as’ they
marched around Pitt’_s campus and parts of
South Oakland at the Take Back the Night
march on Friday evening.

. “This is our most empowering and
popular event, it’s a great wayvto get out
there and sayhell no to rape, we’re not
going to take it anymore,” said Laura
Garvin, co-president of the Campus’
Women’s Organization. _

This event started with poster-rnaking
at the William Pitt Union. Posters were
handed out to everyone as they arrived.
Different messages like ‘.‘ﬁght back,” “no
means no,” “break the silence,” - and
“abuse isn’t kinky” were written on the

posters.

Allison Glancey, a Pitt student who
came up with the idea for a White Flower
Campaign, told everyone the basic idea of
the campaign as white Carnations were
handed out. -

“This is about trying to prevent rape ’

and helping people to just talk about or
even acknowledge that it happens beyond
using words,”~ Glancey said. “The ﬂowers
can symbolize hope, peace and ‘healing in
a Way that words can’t.” - -
Glancey instructed everyone to carry
their ﬂowers, hand them out to someone
and let that person know what it is for, or

. place the ﬂower at a spot on campus
where a rape or sexual assault may have

occurred.

Janet Syphan, a Women’s’ Rights
Activist in the Pittsburgh area, was the
keynote speaker of the evening. She
focused on the topic of teaching men not
to rape‘ instead of teaching women
avoid rape. »

“I want to talk about how many men
rape women because men need to under-
stand that they do have the power to rape
women,” Syphan said. She added that
men need to say no to rape and yes to

poems, one on a personal self—defense
class she had taken at Pitt, another one
written to a good friend, and the last one
was about a bad date she once went on.
Then, the march began. Participants
held up their ‘signs and started to
chant,”We have the power, we have the
right, the streets are ours, take back the

-night.”

“The march is an adrenaline rush for

me,” Pitt student Celeste Kimbrough said.

“It’s» something I believe strongly in and

see beneﬁts from, on the level" of solidari-

ty in the group tl1at’s marching as well as

the response from other people on the

street.” - _ .

, The demonstrators marched up .-
Bigelow Boulevard to Sutherland Drive
and down Lothrop Street. Once they

reached Forbes Avenue, they headed into
' South Oakland. '

Throughout the march, voices yelled,
“Whatever we wear, wherever we go, yes
means yes, and no means no.”. ‘

“‘Two, Four, Six, Eight, real men
don’t rape” was the ﬁnal chant of the ,
evening. _ ‘ ' A
“I felt really happy about participating
in the march and seeing so many people
who could get’ together for such a good
cause,” Pitt student Julie Wagner said.

Back at the Union, white ‘candles

’were handed ‘to each demonstrator.

Andrea DeChellis, public relations direc-
tor of the CW O, gave an introduction to
the Open Mic Speakout. “This is a type of
support group for anyone who wants to
share their thoughts,” DeChellis said.
‘People shared poems and stories,
telling how rape and sexual violence has
impacted their lives. Tears were shed,

~ laughter was ‘heard, and love was spread

as people took tums at the microphone. 1

“Hearing peop1e’s stories makes» us
more aware of rape and sexual assault,’’'
Wagner said. “It brings these unfortunate
realities to life.” ”

Middle East conflict re-routesSAS voyage  

RACHEL RANDALL

Staff Writer

Students onvthe fall 2000 Semester

at Sea voyage face major changes to
their itinerary with tension growing
between Israelis and Palestinians in the
MiddleEast. ' S

The ship, which still had ports of
call in Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, Spain and
Cuba, will now be sailing to Kenya,
South Africa, Brazil and Cuba instead.

The Institute for Shipboard
Education made the decision to alter the
itinerary after the recent outbreak of vio-
lence between Israelis and Palestinians
andthe bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in
Yemen. '

“Prudence dictated that we
rearrange the schedule because of the
unpredictability of the region at this
time,” Paul Watson, director of enroll-
ment management at ISE, said.

_ , According to an ISE press release
the decision was made after a careful
analysis of information and advice from
the.’ Department of , State Pinkerton
Global Intelligence Services and other
sources both in the United States and the
Middle East. 

All of the countries on the new itin-
erary are regularly visited by the spring
program of Semester at Sea and there-

MATTHEW SCHLIESMAN
Staff Writer

Brandin Knight sighed in relief and
muttered, “thank God it’s all over,” as he
walked down the steps of the Allegheny
County Municipal Court Building Friday
morning.

Knight pleaded guilty to one count of
leaving ﬂue scene of an accident, one count
of careless operation and two counts of
failing to stop at a stop sign Friday mom-
ing in ‘front of Magistrate Irene
McLaughlin in Allegheny County Trafﬁc
Court. 0

The original charges against Knight
also included evading police, reckless
operation and another count of leaving the
scene of an accident T _

All six counts amounted to a misde-
meanor charge‘ for which Knight was
arrested three weeks ago. Because two of
those original charges were dropped and
the reckless operation charge was, lowered
to a careless operation charge, Knight was
not convicted of a misdemeanor. Knight
had a clean  record, valid driver’s

insurance and the victims were willing to .

drop charges against him.

Knight must pay approximately $650
in ﬁnes and his insurance company must
pay to repair the damage done to the two
victims’ cars. Knight also had 14 points
added to his license for his various offens-
es. His license is not currently suspended,
but the Pennsylvania Department of Motor

Vehicles may bring his case to a hearing

and decide to suspend it. If this were to
happen it wouldn’t go into effect for at

least three months.

According to police,‘ Knight’s ordeal
began three weeks ago on the morning of
Oct. 6 when he driving his black Chevrolet ’-

Tahoe on Atwood Street in South Oakland.

A City of Pittsburgh patrol car was behind 3
Knight when the arresting ofﬁcer saw him it
sideswipe two cars, Michele Rosen’s 1997 };
black Nissan Maxima and Brian Gerio’s 
1989 burgtmdy Chevrolet Celebrity in

ﬁont of 335 Atwood St.
"Police said Knight stopped beside the

two vehicles for a few seconds before-

pulling away. The arresting ofﬁcer activat-
ed his lights and followed Knight down
Atwood Street where Knight ran his ﬁrst
stop sign at the corner of Atwood and
Louisa streets. Knight then turned left onto

Louisa and ran another stop sign when he"

tumed right on to Semple Street and head-
ed toward Forbes Ave.

According to the police report on the

incident, Knight was ﬁnally stopped by a

parked car that was blocking his path. 5
Knight was arrested without incident and

was taken to the Allegheny County -Jail at A
2:58 am. where he posted $100, 10 per-1

cent of his $1,000 bail, and was released at

5:37 pm. the same day. 2 V ‘-

Knight is scheduled to play in the
tearn’s

a game last season, starting 25 of 28 games
for the Panthers.

Philadelphia Eagles. Croce said that as he
was working toward his dream, more than
a few doors were slammed in his face.
Croce said he. took the rejections as a
lesson. '
“Don’t expect things to happen -

\ make them happen,” he said.

Croce took extra courses in sports
medicine and began expecting instead of
wanting success for his efforts.

A, A few years, later he became the
physical conditioning coach for_the Flyers
and later the 76ers. Then he began his
own empire by founding Sports Physical
Therapists Inc. In 1993 he sold the suc-
cessful company, walking away from the

. deal with $40 million.

Croce said he quickly became bored
and hated the extra time he had on his
hands’. ' ,

He decided he wanted to acquire the
76ers and expand them into a team that
the “City of Brotherly Love” could be
proud of. .

But when he called Harold Katz, the
then sole owner of the 76ers, Katz told
Croce he wasn’t interested in selling the
team. . .
u “But I heard the soul of a despondent
man, so I attacked,” Croce said.

' Croce pursued, him relentlessly for
months, and finally the deal went
through.  u b

“When theimjedia asked Katz why he
decided to partially sell the team to me, he

said ‘Because Pat Croce called me 50,;
times.”’.  5 » ‘? ~ g . '

H - But Croce said that just because he

found success and money, it doesn’t mean

he never endured hardships.

It was May 15, and his team made it
to the NBA playoffs for the first time in

‘eight years. .

“I had turned suck into luck,” Croce
said about the 76ers. Philadelphia’s
CoreStates Center was bustling outside
while throngs of fans enjoyed live radio
broadcasts, and face painting.

Inside, jubilant. fans chest bumped

and head banged with excitement. Croce
was on top of a railing with two body-
guards holding him upuby the back of his
shirt, screaming along with the fans.

Only one month later, on June 15,.
Croce laid on the side of the road with his
motorcycle. He thought his boot“ had —
ﬂown off his foot during the accident.

When he picked up his boot, to his
horror, his foot was still in it.

Croce said doctors told him that he
would never walk on his own leg again.
But he maintained a positive attitude.

“There is no room for negative peo-
ple. Dreams do come true,” Croce said.

Six surgeries later he gave up his
crutches and again walks on his own leg.

Croce ended his presentation with a
quote he said he learned from his mother,
Dolores. He. gives her credit for his drive
and determination. 4 . A.

‘Two people look out the same win-
dow each night, one sees the mud, the
other sees the stars,” he said.

with the nation’s current ﬁnancial suc-
cess, including the tripling of the stock
market, in addition to the current black
and Latino unemployment rates, which

FROM PAGE 1

. are the lowest in history.

“I am not satisﬁed,” he said. “I’m
asking for your support on the basis of the
better future economy we can create
together.” .

“You ain’t seen notlfmg yet,” Gore
promised, saying, “prosperity itself is on
the ballot,” this fall. . I

Gore stressed the importance of
maintaining a strong, healthy economy,
saying, “I’m promising you that I’ll bal-
ance the budget every year. I’ll‘ pay down
the debt every year, so when you’re my
age, there won’t be any debt.”

Gore proposed tax cuts including
making college tuition tax-deductible up
to $10,000 per year.

“We need to open up the doors to col-
lege wider than ever before,” he said.

He also said that class sizes should be
smaller at public schools, rebuilding and
modernizing schools and making them
the nation’s is “No-.1 priority.” '

He; said that private school vouchers,
advocated "by Bush, drain necessary

A -» --funds from public schools. I .

While outlining his plan of environ
mental support, Gore also told the crowd
that Bush wanted to open Alaskan
wildlife grounds for oil drilling. 

He said he advocates a plan of “high-
quality health care,” including a patients’
bill of rights. ' "

To conclude his speech and further
fire up his supporters, he implored the
crowd to vote, saying there is “one day,
every four years when the special inter-

,_ests have cause to tremble,'to_ be fearful
that you will see through the ‘smoke

screen.”  ._ »
“I ask for your support,” he said.
“But my friends, I need your help. I can’t

do this by myself. I need your help‘.”*

In a grand-fmale-style listing of poli-
cy stances, Gore lifted his Voice. “I’m not
going _to take the guns away from hunters
— I’m going to ' take guns out of the
hands of children,” he said. “I want to
fight for you and your family — that’s
why I want to become president.”

He even acknowledged his straight A

laced image. “I know ,1 will not be the
most exciting [president, but] I will never

- let you down. I will ﬁght for you and

will never give up.” '

He said he wants to raise the mini-
mum wage by a dollar an hour, in addi-
tion to formulating hate-crime legislation
and enforcing existing civil rights legisla-
tion.

“We need to bring our country
together,” he said. “We are one people.”

He admitted Pennsylvania’s impor-
tant role in the election. “Pennsylvania,
the Keystone State, is the keystone of this
election year.”

\V1th the large crowd of CMU and‘

Pitt students present, Gore did not give up
an opportunity to address his .. younger
supporters. A '
“Young people, 18525, can determine
the outcome [of the election],” he said.
He called this generation the largest
generation of studentstgsaying it was the

“most socially aware in the history of the
“nation,” and more involved with chari-

ties.

Gore attributed the traditionally
lower voter turnout among young
Americans to their fear of getting hurt.

“[They’re] concerned that their
hearts might be broken,” he said. “That
their hearts might be disillusioned. or let

down.”

He implored his younger supporters
to get to the polls. ~

“Fight for what you believe in. Fight‘

for the future of this country,” he said. I
“Give me your help,” he said. “Give

me your heart, give me your vote, so I can

ﬁght for you. Let's  this election.”

then sang several songs for the audience,
including one ‘with the refrain, “Drink,
drink, drink.”

Pitt Trustee Thomas Usher, chair-
man of Pitt’s Capital Campaign, intro-
duced “Discoveries of Today” with a
video from Gov. Tom Ridge, R—Pa.

“Chancellor Nordenberg has taken
[Pitt] to the next level,” Ridge said. “Just
look at the numbers.”

Ridge citedPitt’s $1 billion endow-
ment, $328 million in research funding
and numerous campus building projects.

Following an original composition
by Nathan Davis and the Pitt Jazz
Ensemble, exercises by the women’s
gymnastics team and poetry by Mary
Robb Jackson, a KDKA reporter,
Nordenberg spoke about “Discoveries of
the Future.”

“What a great weekend, what a great
University, what a great group of
friends,” Nordenberg said.

Nordenberg said that he was over-
whelmed when he and his wife first
drove through the Fort Pitt tunnels more
than 20 years ago.

“When I first arrived, I was proud.
But it was just a feeling. I also felt that
this was a very special place,” he said.
“A great university is all about imagining
a better future and then helping to shape
it.”

Nordenberg said that when the
University wanted to start its silent fund-
raising campaign three years ago, critics
told him that he was moving too fast.

He told them that the students need
things right now.

“We started our silent campaign and
it worked. Our goal is to support the
extraordinary people and projects at
Pitt,” he said.

When Nordenberg announced the
$500 million goal, he also said of the
$356 million already raised, “that’s one
heck of a start.”

“Students are the principle reason for
this campaign. We exist to develop their
interests and dreams. This campaign for
Pitt must succeed. I have no doubt that it
will.”

The campaign’s goals were outlined
in the weekend’s program:

0 Enhance the University’s under-
graduate programs and reinforce the
strength of its graduate and professional
programs

0 Attract and retain the finest teach-
ing and research faculty

0 Revamp existing educational and
student life facilities and invest in new
special purpose facilities and technolo-
gies

0 Strategically invest in key pro-
grammatic activities to enhance educa-
tion, research, economic development
and community initiatives

These goals will have a direct impact
on students in terms of the number of
endowed scholarships and professor-

  

ships, the new athletics venue and the
Multi-Purpose Academic Complex.

The students involved in the produc-
tion all stood up on stage and led the
crowd in singing Pitt’s alma mater.

The audience dispersed into the cold
night, gathering under large tent on the
Cathedral lawn.

There, they enjoyed a new world
buffet which featured Aegean, Tandoori,
Paciﬁc Rim, Mediterranean and other
international food. Guests could also
walk to the Commons Room of the
Cathedral for more food and seating. The
food was prepared by Sodexho Marriott.

During dinner, fireworks and lights
decorated the Cathedral, accompanied by
music.

Hundreds watched from within the
warm conﬁnes of the clear—roofed tent
while others braved the cold outside.

Everything seemed perfect at the
gala held in the tent on the Cathedral
lawn Saturday night as part of Pitt’s
Capital Campaign to raise money for
the University. An international buf-
fet of foreign delicacies tantalized
the guests. The Cathedral looked
gorgeous, illuminated in brilliant
shades of all colors in the visible
light spectrum, with fireworks
exploding off the top around 10 pm.

Only one thing was missing .
from the splendid sight —- the stu-

dents.

Except for a few prominent
members of select student organiza-
tions, students were not invited to the
shindig on Saturday. This is under-
standable, as it would have been
logistically and ﬁnancially difficult
to make it an open affair. But stu-
dents were not even allowed in the
vicinity of the tent to watch the light
show. In fact, students were not a
part of the vast majority of activities
that took place as a part of Discovery
Weekend.

Virtually the only avenue avail-

able for students to interact with‘

alumni was the open house Friday
evening for student groups in the
William Pitt Union. Of course, this
event was inclusive only of those
students involved in organizations
that meet in the Union; furthermore

it was poorly publicized and conse-
quently not well attended.

It isa genuine loss for both stu-
dents and alumni that the University
did not structure more opportunities
for the two groups to meet. Alumni
should understand better than any-
one that the Pitt experience is much
more than attending fancy dinners
andlistening to speeches. Truly dis-
covering Pitt. means discovering the
students, talking with them and

V  about their experiences,

academic and otherwise. The
University could have facilitated this
in a number of ways, such as -spon-
soring a student-alumni picnic
Saturday afternoon, or at the very
least inviting students to take part in
the joy of watching colorful light dis-
plays on our campus’ most-revered
building.

It is disappointing that students
and alumni missed the chance to
bond over the one _thing we both
share —— a love for this University.
The Capital Campaign may have
generated funds with its guest speak-
ers, banquets and other fancy-
schmancy programming this week-
end, but in doing so it passed up on
an even more important opportunity,
that of promoting Pitt pride by unit-
ing the lifeblood of the University’s
past with the soul of its present.

An inner voice whispering somewhere deep
inside me tells me that I am a Democrat Sadly I
do not know much beyond this. I am embanassed
to admit this, being that I am editor of the opin-
ions section of this newspaper, and many people’s

opinions are inevitably tied to politics.

I have severe difﬁculty staying atop all of the
issues, understanding which candidate stands for.
what and so on, and complete impairment with

. regard to actually getting excited about anything

that takes place in the political sphere.

But last Friday I decided to pay heed to the
voice of my inner Democrat It started Thursday,
as I was walking past Soldiers & Sailors

Memorial on my way to class in Chevron. It  

9:30 am, and people were ﬂood-
ing into the building to hear Gov.

On the sidewalk pro-Al Gore pro-
testers were chanting and waving
signs. It all seemed very exciting." I
wanna go to apolitical rally, I thought longingly.

In my next class, I started whining to my
friend Lauren about my strange and sudden
desire to take part in the political hoopla, and my
regret over not going to see Bush. Then Lauren
had a brilliant idea She pointed out that the Gore
rally hadn’t taken place yet, and suggested that
we go see him. My heart leapt. We got our tickets
from the University Democrats and I spent the
remainder of the day babbling to my ﬁiends
about my upcoming adventure. ’

The Gore rally was scheduled to begin at
4:15 p.m. Friday; Lauren had work at 3:30 so we
rushed over to Camegie Mellon University with
little time to spare. As we approached the grassy
knoll where Gore was set to speak, several
activists handing out stickers, ﬂiers and buttons
came into view. I smiled’at the prospect of free
stulf and proudly afﬁxed a blue-and—red Gore-
Lieberman sticker on my dress.

I liked the sticker a lot but I felt like a bit of a
poser wearing it Was I qualiﬁed to do so, was I
qualiﬁed to- even be at this rally? Most people
were here because they knew a lot about Gore’s
policies and supported the bulk of them. I was
here because I thought going to a rally looked fun,
and deep-down I felt that I might be Democrat,

A politicl poet visits a

 

 

though I had trouble vocalizing why.

I felt a little better when I got a sticker from
the NARAL people and was reminded that Gore
is pro-choice. I did in fact know this, and perhaps
that had a good deal to do with the subconscious
development of my inner Democrat. Abortion is.
perhaps the one issue on which I have a clear
standpoint. -

blasted immediately before Gore took the stage. I
watched as a few hippie kids at the edge of the
crowd grooved; me and everyone else cheered
and shook the complimentary red, white and blue
pom—porns that were being dispersed through the

crowd My instinct was right, I thought —— politi-

cal rallies really are ﬁm.
I tried to pay attention during
Gore’s speech but got distracted
because I was busy looking at all
the other people in the crowd. My
diverted attention was a little
embarrassing but not really surprising, consider-
ing that I am a person who ends up observingthe
humans and not the wildlife when I go to the zoo.
Whatlwas seeingattheGorerally—a
wondrously eclectic range of ways in which peo-
ple were expressing’ their mutual support —
made me extremely happy. I saw union workers
in black pro-Gore T—shirts. I saw a lot of women
with Gore stickers attached to their little tank tops
and one woman with Gore stickers on her blue
mechanic’s jump suit. I saw a couple near the
back of the crowd; both of them were short and
the man would periodically let the woman climb
on his back so she could see better, then she
would do the same for him. _
A spirit of liveliness, optimism and energy

rippled through die crowd, and I concluded joy- I

ously that there seemed to be room here, on this
relatively small plot of grass, for all varieties of
political expression. Even room for ef self-pro-
claimed political poser. who came simply because
she thought it would be enjoyable, who is just
beginning to discover precisely why she hears the
voice of an inner Democrat.

Elizabeth Bowen thinks jokes about Bush being

called a “shrub” and the like are ﬁmny.

 

Bush versus Gore on education

,-..‘ _....—.

 

’ ondary education systems in

if-MoN1)AY,cOCToBER 30, 2000

Bush’s plan will lessen  

It is clear thateducation is the most vital
issue being discussed in-this election.

. Education is the foundation on which a

nation is built. The quality of education that

0 a child receives can be the opening of an

opportunity to realize the American dream

or can imprison a child in a lifetime of igno- ,
. rance.

' With regard to education, America
needs a president who is willing to break
new ground and not offer more of the same.

Gov. George W. Bush, R-Texas, has

 said that education is the new civilrights

issue, because schools that are failing at such
a spectacular rate are predominantly minor-
ity. Children who go to these schools are
more likely to go to jail, live below the
poverty line and end up sending their chil-
dren to the same failing schools they attend-
ed. It is a vicious cycle that is trapping too
many minorities in the situations of poverty,
crime and despair. '
Bush’s commitment to minority educa-
tion shows in the fact that black fourth
gradersﬁem Texas rankﬁrstinthe nationin
math. The number of minorities and disad-
vantaged students passing skills tests has
increased by 89 percent there.
America needs a radical
change in primary and sec-

order to give all children a
chance to succeed Bush is will-
ing to make those changes. He will support
programs to test children every year so that
we know whether learning is taking place.
He supports the end of social promotion, the
policy that advances kids based on their age
and not by their knowledge.

He supports treating teachers like the
professionals they are, protecting them from
lawsuits, allowing them to deduct up to
$400 for classroom expenses,‘creating new

programs to provide money for teacher

recruitment and advanced training, but also
holding them accountable for the work they
do.

My own mother is a teacher who is sup-
porting Bush because of his commitment to
education. . . <

The most contentious new reform being
proposed by Bush is school vouchers. Bush
would use them as a measure of last resort,
one he would oﬂ’er as the ﬁnal option to save
children from a lifetime of disappointment.
It is all part of Bush’s comprehensive plan.

Failing schools can no longer be toler-
ated. That is why, in.-these schools, the fed-

- eral money that goes to each school per stu-

dent would instead go to the parents. He

would also encourage states to do the same, A

.\llCH.-XEL

 disparities in education quality

so themoneya available would be adequate
to payfor the private institutions politicians
such as Vice PresidentAl Gore sent his chil-
dren to.

It is time for a voucher system that

would afford to poor inner-city minorities
the same educational opportunities that rich,
white suburbanites have. It is time for our

education system to stop reinforcing the

class structure of our society by giving stu-
dents an education based on the economic

- status of their parents.

Now I realize people may accuse Bush
of taking money away from public schools.
This is not accurate; the money taken away
wﬂl be the money that goes to each school
per student If they lose a student to a private

* school then they no longer have the cost of

educating that student We have to decide

which is more important — saving kids or

propping up a failing educational monopoly.

I’ve also been told that there are no

guarantees in private schools because there
is a lack of regulation. Funny, all those regu-
lations havenft helped our kids in today’s
public schools. ‘Furthermore, there is one
thingtl1atIcanguarantee—thatifactionis
not taken our youth will contin-
ue to  forced into lives of
squalor and misery by inetfec-
tive public schools.
' Finally, with regard to
higher education, Bush’s com-
mitment to the disadvantaged is also clear.
Bush will increase the Pell grant, and in a
new innovation will expand it speciﬁcally to
students who take diﬂicult courses_ in high
school. This follows the principle that stu-
dent who take the initiative should be given
the most help.

A brilliant program that Bush has used
in Texas, the 10 percent plan, has increased
both minority enrollment and retention. It
guarantees admission to the top _l0 percent
of every high school class in Texas to the
state universities.» This encourages real
diversity — of region, race, class and back-
ground — while. rewarding demonstrated
achievement

Little progress has been made in educa-
tion over the last eight years, especially con-
cerning decreasing the gap in educational
experiences of minority and white children.
More of the same will produce more of the
same results. We need a new leader with
new ideas who will work to improve educa-
tion for all children. That leader is George
W. Bush

Michael Koms feels that getting a good edu-
cation is hispersonal top priority.

    

  Gore’s plan targets    
education reform at all levels

' The presidential elections are almost
upon us, and a momentous decision will
soon be made. We, as a nation,_ must
choose a leader. .

‘ Individually, we all have a special
issue that we want our leader to address.
For many of us college students, that issue
is education and with good

reason. Education is the focal SABR' NA

SPIHER  

point of our current existence.

So which leader has a
plan for education that will
work? Al Gore.

In terms of higher education, which
affects you and me, and also primary and
secondary education, which aﬂects our lit-
tle brothers and sisters, nieces, nephews,
younger cousins and the future of America
in general — our future.

For all of us college students, Gore
proposes providing an annual tax _deduc-
tion of $10,000 worth of college tuition, or,
if you prefer, an armual $2,800 tax credit.
He also provides for a National Tuition
Savings plan, which allows families to
save for college with tax-free, inﬂation-free
accounts. This would certainly be a wel-

come break considering that college costs

are currently rising faster than the general
rate of inﬂation.

According to the Web site www.algo-
re.come, “[These accounts] will link
statewide college savings and prepaid
tuition plans  and use incentives to
encourage states that do not have the pro-
grams to create them..”

Gore has also proposed 401(k)
“Lifelong Learning” accounts, allowing

individuals, with their employers, to save

tax-free for job training and lifelong educa-
tion for themselves and their families.

_ Of course, the road to higher education
does notbegin at high school graduation.
Preparation for college begins in the earli-
est years of education, and so candidates’
plans regarding primary and secondary
education must be discussed as well.

So let’s put this voucher thing to rest
once and for all.

Bush’s voucher plan leaves millions of
children behind. Of the 43 million kids in
public schools, only’ 2.1 million — less
than ﬁve percent — would be eligible for a
Bush voucher. The other 95 percent would
be trapped in schools drained of vital fund-
ing as the govemment gives public money
away to private enterprise. Not to mention
that a $1,500 voucher is completely inade-
quate in the new millennium economy. The
average private school tuition cost more
than twice that amount seven years ago.

Given Bush’s- talk of “choice,” it is

important to note that states would not’

have much choice when it came to vouch-
ers. Despite Bush’s arguments to the con-
trary, his plan would make vouchers a
mandate for states rather than a choice by
virtue of the fact that the federal govem-
ment would provide only
$750 worth of a $1,500
voucher, leaving states to
search for ways to fund the

  
  

Besides vouchers,
Bush’s education plan has other failings.
The Bush plan does nothing for three
years, and then abandons failing schools,
stripping them of Title 1 funding and pro-
viding them with no other assistance, leav-

’ ing millions of kids without hope for a

quality education. When asked about what
would happen to such schools, Bush could
only say, “Hopefully the school will
change.” _ V

Fortunately there is a better way. Al
Gore would use $500 million in account-
ability funds‘ to help failing schools, which,
under his administration, would be
required to improve. Schools that did not
improve would be shut down and then
reopened with new teachers and new
administrators.

Meanwhile, Gore would provide stu-
dents of such schools with intensive after-
school tutoring programs or the chance to
transfer to a better public school. Gore
would also hire 1 million more better-qual-
iﬁed teachers over the next 10 years, there-
by reducing class size and improving edu-
cational quality. Gore also believes that
teachers should be treated and paid like
professionals. The Democratic National
Platform proposes that all teachers should
get a raise, but only if they meet tough yet
fair standards as quality‘ educators.

So there you have it. The Bush plan for
primary and secondary education simply
does not work, but the Gore plan will. In
terms of higher education, Gore has all
kinds of nifty, money-saving goodies for

college, making higher education more ‘

accessible for everyone.

So whom will you trust with your edu-
cation? Al Gore, the man who said, “There
is no greater test of our national responsi-
bility than the quality of education we pro-
vide” or Bush, the man who said “Higher
education is not my priority.”

Late field

BRAD CUPRIK

Assistant Sports Editor

BLACKSBURG, Va.
Everything was in place for an
upset victory.

Virginia Tech All-American
quarterback Michael Vick was on
crutches; Pitt quarterback John
Turman threw four touchdown pass-
es; the Panthers were up by seven
points with one quarter to play.

Then, the Panthers let the game
slip through their respective fingers
as freshman kicker Carter Warley
nailed a 27-yard field goal with 16
seconds remaining to give the No. 2
Hokies a 37-34 win.

“This was a tough one,” Pitt
head coach Walt Harris said. “Give
credit to Virginia Tech. They’re a
great football team.”

Dave Meyer, a redshirt senior,
came in for Vick during the second

quarter and led the Hokies (8-0
overall, 6-0 Big East) to four scor-
ing drives and 20 points. Along the
way, Meyer erased deficits of 20-17
and 34-27 and gave the Panthers (5-
2, 2-2) a lesson in the importance of
backups.

Vick injured his knee midway
through the second quarter, and
limped off the field as Meyer came
on.

On the Hokies’ next drive, Vick
returned to an overjoyed crowd at
Lane Stadium.

He moved the Hokies into
Panther territory, down 20-17, and
was crumpled beneath three Pitt
defenders. '

Vick stayed down again and was
taken off the field and to the hospi-
tal for x—rays.

It was Meyer and Lee Suggs, the
Hokies’ star running back, who kept
the team unbeaten. Suggs ran for a
career-high 164 yards on 28 carries

and three touchdowns.

Suggs now has 17 touchdowns
on the season, a new Hokie record.

He got the Hokies on the board
with 2:59 remaining in the first
quarter on a 2-yard touchdown run.

The Panthers wasted no time in
coming back with a score of their
own, ‘when Turman found Latef
Grim open for a 47-yard scoring
strike. _

It was Grim’s first touchdown
of the season.

Nick Lotz’s extra point attempt
was blocked and the Panthers
trailed by one. 0 i

The Pitt defense stepped up
early in the second quarter when
Vick’s pass was bobbled by tight
end Browning Wynn. Wynn was hit
from behind by linebacker Lewis
Moore, and the ball popped into the
air and into the arms of defensive
end Bryan Knight.

On the very next play, Turman

found a wide-open Antonio Bryant
in the end zone, but as Bryant
dropped to his knees to catch the

' low-thrown ball, he dropped it.

The two connected on the next
play, however, from 17 yards out,
and Pitt took a 13-7 lead.

“The good Lord must have been
with him,” Harris said. “To drop
one like he did, and be able to come
back on the next play and get the
touchdown was big.”

After a Warley field goal cut the
Panthers’ lead to 13-10, Pitt was
forced to punt.

Pitt punter Jay Junko shanked
the kick off the side of his foot, and
the ball bounced back before it was
downed at the Pitt 19 for a 4-yard
punt.

Suggs scored again from 2 yards
outwith 6:26 remaining to put the
Hokies back on top, 17-13.

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

BLACKSBURG, Va. — Known
to his teammates as “Deep—ball
Dave”, Dave Meyer had“ one of the
easiest jobs in the country.

Backing up Virginia Tech’s All-
American quarterback Michael
Vick, Meyer hasn’t had to take a
meaningful snap in the past two
years. ’

That all changed Saturday
evening, when Meyer was thrust
into the spotlight as Vickleft the

' Hokies’ gameagainst Pitt with a

sprained ankle.
Meyer entered the game just
before halftime with the score tied,

  20-20.

While the Pitt offense continued
to put up points in the second half,
Meyer led the VT offense to 10
points in the fourth quarter as the
Hokies held off Pitt for a 37-3
win. .

“I admire »a young man who
sticks it out like he did,” Pitt head
coach Walt Harris said of Meyer.
“He led his team to victory today
and I congratulate him for that.”

Meyer wasn’t spectacular in the

- rushing attack.

Vic-k’s injury opens    
the Qdoor for Meyer

game, but with the running game

BLACKSBURG, Va. — If
you’ve been a Pitt fan for a long
time, you’re used to this. If you’re
new to the club, Saturday’s loss by
Pitt to Virginia Tech is a good initia-
tion ceremony.

In 1998, it was a loss to Penn
State at home, 20-13, that broke the
hearts of the Pitt faithful. The next

year, another loss to the Nittany

Lions followed by crushing defeats
at Boston_College and West Virginia
were the keys to a 5-6 season that
could have easily been an 8-3 sea-
son. .

And this year, the Panthers are
5-2, which is obviously a record that
any Pitt fan would have been proud

of at the beginning of the season-

The only problem is that the
Panthers should be 7-0.

Pitt’s two losses have been to
Syracuse and Virginia Tech, by a
combined total of 10 points, both on
the road.

In both games, the Panthers bat-

’ tled valiantly before losing at the

very end of the game.
‘ I’m sick of it.

moral to the story for the Panthers

Pitt needs to find a Way to win
these big games. The Panthers must
concentrate on defeating North
Carolina this week, and
then they can look ahead
to a battle with No. 3
Miami at the “Orange
Bowl the week after.

“I feel terrible about los-
ing,” Pitt head coach Walt
Harris said.

Thanks, coach. I feel your
pain.

Virginia Tech is a good
team. They may even be a
great team. But that’s no
excuse for Pitt not win-
ning. The Panthers had
the Hokies on the ropes
Saturday.

Many fans will point to John
Turman’s overthrown pass to R.J.
English late in the fourth quarter as
a missed opportunity, one that cost
Pitt the game. Yes, it was a missed
opportunity, but no, it didn’t cost
Pitt the game. ’ I

What cost the Panthers the game
was the defense’s inability to stop

the Virginia Tech running game. Call
me crazy, but I think that Pitt might
have actually been in better shape

had Michael Vick not gone
down with an ankle
injury.

Before you go
screaming about me being
the worst journalist ever,
hear me out. Or read me out,
I guess.

When Vick was in the
game, the Hokies were look-
ing topass against Pitt.

That resulted in the Pitt

defense blitzing fre-

quently, confusing Vick

and leading to sacks and
incomplete passes. In his
nearly 30 minutes of action, Vick
was 8-of-15 for 80 yards with one
interception. Not exactly Heisman
Trophy credentials, eh?

After Vick left the game; the
Hokies made a commitment to the
run. Unfortunately for Pitt fans, the
defense could not stop Lee Suggs.
Or Jarrett Ferguson. Or Andre
Kendrick.

 

“We’re not satisfied with the
results but We’re excited about the
players fighting so hard,” Harris
said.

To me, that sounds like Harris is
endorsing the game as a moral victo-
ry. But alas, I’m wrong.

“Those of you that cover us on a
regular basis know that I’m not into
the concept of moral victories,”
Harris said. “Turning programs
around has never been easy. We’re
knocking on that door and working
hard to kick it in.”

Well for the second time this
year, and the fifth time in three
years, the Panthers couldn’t kick the
door in. Maybe next time, they
should just try to turn the handle
instead.

‘ Mario Machi is the sports editor of

The Pitt News and he is now in
search of a job in December, as he
promised that he would drop out of

of the season. He knows that Pitt has
only lost the first game, but any-
thing ’s possible.

Josh Whitham’s fourth ‘goal of
the year in the 65th minute of yester-
day’s 1-0 win over Syracuse secured
a home game for the men’s soccer
team. in the upcoming Big East
Tournament.

Whitham, a redshirt sophomore,
put the ball behind Syracuse goal-
keeper Kevin Bacher from 7 yards
out at the 64:14 mark to tally the
game’s lone goal. _

Senior Andrew Light picked up
an assist o_n the play, as he got the
ball on the left side of the field and
curled a cross pass that Whitham was
able to get a foot on in a crowd of
players. . ‘

“The goal came off a scrappy
p1ay,” Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher
said. “It wasn’t a picturesque goal,
but it got through.”

The Panthers (13—4, _7-4 Big

East) clinched fourth place with the

victory at Quaker Valley High-

School, setting up a quarterfinal
showdown with Seton Hall on
Sunday; ,.

' The field the Panthers will use is
undetermined, as is the time of the
game.

The Panthers have played all

three of their Sunday home games at -

Quaker Valley, which is the most

likely place for the Seton Hall game. '

After Whitham’s goal, the
Orangemen (8-7-2, 4-5-2) were
penalized with four yellow cards in
22:54, the first by Mario Cristofori at
65:12.

Chris Aloisi was carded as well
at the 68:15 mark, and Pitt’s Clay
Haﬂich at the 71:43 mark.

“None of the fouls were crazy

fouls,” Luxbacher said. “They need- 4

ed to make a play and got there a lit-
tle late.”

Just 31 seconds later, Pitt took
the -lead back on a 26-yard pass
from Turman to Bryant. It was only

the second play of the drive after
Turman connected with wide

completion.

Warley’s second field goal_of
the game, from 38 yards out, tied
the game at 20-20 with just 17 sec-
onds left in the first half.

“I’m still going out there think-
ing I have to catch every ball
thrown at me,” Bryant said about
his dominance.

He had nine catches in the game

for .127 yards and three touch-
downs, giving him 17 receptions for
349 yards and five scores in the
Panthers’ last two games.

The Hokies scored first in the

second half on a 6-yard run by full-
back Jarrett Ferguson, and had the

 lead going into the last minute of

the third quarter.

'Explosive cou1dn’t describe
what had happened next to the
Hokies, according to head coach

R Frank Beamer.

Kevan Barlow scored on a 2-
yard run to tie the game at 27-27
with 29 seconds remaining and after
a Meyer fumble was recovered by
Ryan Gonsales, it was Turman and
Bryant hooking up again.

Turman threw a fade pass to the
right side of the Hokies end zone
that Bryant had to reach out and
grab as he slid one foot inbounds
for the touchdown.

As the clock wore down in the.
fourth quarter, so did the Panthers
defense, and Virginia Tech tied the
game with 12:16 left on a 3-yard
run by Suggs.

“We got big plays when we
needed them,” Suggs said, “Every
time they’d score, we’d come back
and get one.”

After the Panthers were forced
to punt again, the clock worked
against ‘them as Meyer led the
Hokies downfield with big runs by
Suggs and Ferguson.

The big play onthe drive came
on a pass interference call against
Shawn Robinson of the Panthers.
He leaped over Hokies wide receiv-
er Shawn» Witten, who was 2 -yards
short of the first down marker on
his route.

Robinson was flagged and the
Hokies were rewarded with an auto-
matic first down and the chance to
kick the game-winning field goal. _

“There are no moral victories,”
Bryant said. “Every damn time we

get close, something happens and’-

we have to_ find out what it is. We
have to learn how to win these types
of games.”

Knight looked at the game in a
similar way, from the defensive side

of the ball.

“We had enough moral victories
last year,” Knight said.

The Pitt running game was
stopped by the Hokies for the sec-
ond consecutive season. The
Panthers were held to just 24 yards
on. 29 carries, less than a" yard per
carry.

Turman had another strong
game, completing 17-of-26 passes
for 311 yards and the four touch-
downs, against just one intercep-
tion. ‘

One of the highlights of the
game was the play of Grim, who
tied Dietrich Jells for first place on
Pitt’s all-time receptions list with
160.

Grim finished the game with
three receptions for 106 yards.

“Our guys fought hard,” Harris
said. “They’re not the N o. 2 team in
the nation because they’re a bad
football team.

Meyer was 7-of-13 for 114
yards in the game and also ran four
times for 14 yards.

“He’s been around for a while,’’
Harris said. “He’s a veteran football
player and he beat us.” _ 4

Pitt returns home in search of its
sixth win, making the team bowl-
eligible. '

The Panthers take on North
Carolina on Saturday at 6:30 p.m.
in their last scheduled non-confer-
ence game of the year.

Pitt goalkeeper Justin Gaul was
able to pick up his fifth shutoutvof
the season, stopping all six Syracuse
shots on goal. .

Bacher had eight saves for the
Orangemen, with the only blemish
being Whitham’s goal.

Syracuse had the upper hand in
the shots category in the first half by
a 6-4 margin, but the Panthers’ scor-
ing opportunities increased in the
final 45 minutes outshooting the
Orangemen 12-4.

Before the playoff game against
Seton Hall, the Panthers were to host

game was cancelled because the

did not want to _.risk any players
going down with injuries before the
start of the tournament. .

In their only meeting this year,
the Panthers beat Seton Hall, 4-3,
Sept. 24 at Quaker Valley.

In that game, Miles Dowiak had
one goal and two assists as the
Panthers rallied from a 3-2 deficit to
win. Dowiak and Chad Porter scored
12 seconds apart in the 61st minute
to beat the Pirates.
