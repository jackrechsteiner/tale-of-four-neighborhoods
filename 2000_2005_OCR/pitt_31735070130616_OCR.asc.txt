JOSEPH KIELEC

Staff Writer

The trauma of heart surgery has
gone well beyond the chilling first
moments when George Miller came out
of anesthesia. “I actually thought -that I
didn’t quite make it,” he said, referring
to the scene when he woke up in the
eerily antiseptic intensive care unit con-
nected to a myriad of computers and
other machines.

Miller, a janitor at the University of
Pittsburgh, underwent coronary artery
bypass graft surgery a little more than
four months ago and is still feeling the
effects of the procedure.

The procedure involves taking
healthy blood vessels from other parts
of the body, such as the mammary
artery in the chest and the radial artery
in the arm, and using them to bypass
clogged coronary arteries of the heart.
The arteries are commonly clogged
with fat or calcium deposits in a condi-
tion known as arteriosclerosis.‘The nar-
rowing of T the vessel increases the
chances that a piece of debris could
completely block the artery, drastically
reducing the amount of oxygen reach-
ing the heart and causing a heart attack.

Perhaps the most important
aspect of the new procedure is that it
may be performed on patients who are
too weak to survive the surgery as it is
traditionally performed. »,

It usually takes a year to fully
recover from the operation, though
patients wear thescars from the surgery
— including one stretching down the
middle of the chest like a zipper from
where the breastbone was split in two
and the rib cage cracked open — for
life. _

And" though Miller feels that
the operation to divert blood ﬂow
around three clogged arteries in. his
heart was a success, he still experiences
aches, as the two halves of his breast-
bone — which are now joined together
by metal twist-ties — slowly heal. He is
also haunted by the deathly experience
of having his body temperature lowered

below 32 degrees Fahrenheit and the 0

beating of his heart stopped’ as he was

/ placed on a heart and lung machine.

New techniques being pioneered by

invasive robotic surgery

surgeons in the~University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center’s Division of
Cardiothoracic Surgery could drastical-
ly reduce the trauma and invasiveness
of CABG for people like Miller. The
research will also lead to hastening
recovery time and possibly even reduc-
ing the number of scarred patients,
whom doctors fondly refer to as mem-
bers of the “zipper club.”

Using robots to implement the
actions of_ the surgeon and an endo-
scopic camera to see "inside the body,
the scars of a large portion of heart
bypass surgeries may one day be
reduced to a few the size of pencil
holes. 0

A similar concept is already
used during surgery performed on other

parts of the body. In arthroscopic‘

surgery, surgeons are able to operate on

the knee without tearing up the skin‘

around the joint. However, the long
instruments traditionally used in endo-
scopic surgery made the precise move-
ments required by CABG nearly
impossible.

“It is like trying to write your
name with the eraser-end of a pencil,”
said Dr. Marco Zenati, director of
UPMC’s Minimally Invasive Cardiac
Surgery program. .

\ Using a robotic technology for
bypass surgery will allow surgeons to
operate without as much bodily dam-
age, which is caused in the traditional
surgery. This technology will allow
doctors to maintain the same precision.

Sitting at a computer console a
few feet from the patient, a surgeon can
see the view inside the patient. The
view is projected on a screen in front of
him from a voice—controlled camera.
The doctor still grasps the same surgi-
cal instruments he would normally use.

Zenati, a veteran in the rapidly

evolving world of non—invasive.

surgery, will use a robot system called

‘ Zeus in an upcoming FDA-sponsored

study. The main focus of the study will
be on whether Zeus can suture arteries
as effectively as performing the task
manually. , . D

By performing the procedure"

on a beating heart, off-pump coronary
artery bypass eliminates the need to

The Pitt News

Last week, The Pitt News ran part one
of a two-part series concerning the histo-
ry and use of the controversial treatment
administered to some patients at Western

Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,‘ known as .

electroconvulsive therapy, “electroshoc ”
or ECT

Modern Uses 

While many legal and institutional
changes caused a decline in ECT from the
1950s through the 1980s, an increasejhas
occurred since late 1980.

Some’ speculate that the upsurge
occurred after introducing the .
technologically—advanced A Thymatron
machine in 1988. A USA Today .article
noted that the manufacturer of Thyrnatron
was owned , by psychiatrist Richard
Abrams, who belonged to the American
Psychiatric Association, which A has
become one of the strongest advocates for
ECT.

In Quebec, for instance, there was an
80 percent increase in ECT use from
1988-1995, and two-thirds of the patients
were women, with a large majority being
over age 65.

Similar increases have been observed
in the United States as well, but with lim-
ited access to ECT records, an accurate
count is '
unattainable.

“There seems to be a resurgence of its
use,” said Wiskeman, who has seen the
numbers rise since outpatient care was
added to WPIC’s ECT program. The pro-
cedure costs $3,000_ to $12,000 and is cov-
ered by most health care plans.

“It seems to go in vogue,” she said. “If

we did one or two outpatient treatments

[per week] ﬁve years ago, it was rare.”
Wiskeman is among the majority
today who believe ECT is perfectly safe,
so much so that pregnant women, chﬂdren
and individuals 90 years old and older are
being treated, she said. ‘

Modem Patients .
But others cry out against its misuse.
Support coalitions, like the
Committee for Truth in Psychology
founded by Marilyn Rice, have grown to

\

have a membership of more than 500 ECT
survivors (as they call themselves). CTIP
does not completely dismiss the need for

. ECT, but advocates patient rights.

“Shocked!”, an lntemet Web site, is
among the many offering chat rooms, edu-
cational sources and links that serve the
mental health community. Chat room
messages posted on-line echo similar
thoughts. “It has ruinediny life”; “I’m not
the same person”; “I wish I’d never went
along with it.” —

. Every once in a while, one will note a
positive experience, to which most replies
say, “Write us in a couple of months and
then tell us how good your memory is.”

Immediate effects are the same for

everyone. Following the seizure, patients .

are rolled to the recovery area where they
awaken, as one may expect, to a splitting
headache, muscle pain, disorientation and
memory loss.

The headache, muscle soreness and
disorientation quickly fade, and for most,
memory impairment does as well. But
others complain of memory gaps lasting
much longer, as well as an inability to
form new memories for years following
the procedure. This is the source of much
of the controversy surrounding present
day ECT. ‘ — ‘_

“It’s worse than not being able to find
your keys, damn it,” said 42-year-old

Susan Wahl from Cherry Hill, . t
. “People just don’t remember day after day

of their lives —" there are huge gaps miss-~
ing from my life.” ‘

Since receiving her last series of only
six treatments in the spring of 1998, Wahl
has found adjusting to life and her studies
at Rutgers University quite difficult.

‘She had to transfer bank accounts
three times after forgetting, her ATM code,
has absolutely no recollection of being in
an automobile. accident, and cannot
remember her sister’s wedding. And the
list goes on. V A

‘ Even after the treatments, depression‘
continues to plague her; yet now so too
does memory loss. [Finding a doctor who
believes her has been difﬁcult. Most have

been ambivalent. One implied that her 
ability to be rational is still distorted by ._
depression,‘ and she_ suggested moreqtreat-_

“The Katz School is inspired by

career at AES, as well as his generosity
and support of the Katz. School,” Dean
Frederick Winter said. “We are con-
vinced that the new Woodcock Faculty

the most deserving faculty and provide
them -with funds to be even more inno-

Katz will work to set an even higher
standard,” Winter said.

Founded in 1981, AES is the

216 youths convicted in the Juvenile
Court of Allegheny County, Pa., and
201 non—delinquent controls from high
schools in Pittsburgh. Bone lead levels,
measured by K X-ray ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy of the tibia, showed that
the delinquent youths had significantly
higher mean concentrations of lead in
their bones — 13.7 parts per million —
compared to the control group. Those
results were true for both whites and
blacks as well as men and women.

“This study provides further evi-
dence that delinquent behavior can be
caused, in part, by childhood exposure
to lead,” Needleman said. “Of all the
causes of juvenile delinquency, lead
exposure is perhaps the most pre-
ventable. These results should be a call
to action for legislators to protect our
children by requiring landlords to not
simply disclose known instances of
lead paint in their properties, but to
remove it.”

connect the patient to the heart and lung
machine Miller so feared. According to
Zenati, 90 percent of the complications
from coronary bypass surgery arise
from the heart—lung machine. Such
complications include memory loss and
depression.

“It’s easier to work on a resting
heart, but it’s better for the patient not
to use the , heart and lung machine,”
Zenati said. “The less you change the
normal steady state of the body, the less
trauma you generate.”

However, in using a. robot to

operate, doctors are not as able to
manipulate the heart as they are in tra-
ditional open—heart surgery. Only a sin-
gleivessel, the left anterior descending
coronary artery, can be accessed endo-
scopically as the technology currently
stands. ‘ ’ ‘

“That vessel has been dubbed
the ‘widow—maker’ because if it goes
down, you die,” said Zenati, stressing
the artery’s importance.

Zenati conceded that although
only 5 percent of CABG ' patients
require that single artery to be
bypassed, this is the first of several

steps to access all coronary arteries V
gendoscopically.

Animal cloning: opportunity to help humanity

ERIN GAMLER

Staff Writer

On March 5, ﬁve healthy pink pigs
were born. Soon their pictures graced
pages of magazines like Time and
Newsweek and appeared in countless
newspapers around the world.

Why would the birth of pigs prompt ‘”

this much interest? Because they
have genes that are identical. They are_
the first cloned pigs in the world.

Roots of Cloning

V Animal cloning has become a new
trend in the world of genetics. The prac-
tice began many years ago with the
cloning of ‘frogs. Today, it has pro-
gressed to include sheep, mice, cattle
and now pigs. _ -

Cloning is a process that involves
taking the DNA; or genetic code, out of
a cell and implanting it into an egg. This
egg is then chemically treated to pro-
mote growth.

' In thepcase of the new piglets born

to PPL Therapeutics, a pig cell’s DNA ‘

was transplanted into a pig egg’ cell and

treated to grow. The egg housing the
. DNA was implanted into a normal

female pig and nine months later, out
came the genetically identical piglets.
‘PPL Research Director Alan

Colman boasted that PPL was “continu-
ing its proud tradition of -achieving
world firsts.” .

Reason to Believe

Dr. Alan Meisel, director of the 6-

Center for Bioethics and Health Law at
the University of Pittsburgh Law
School, believes that there are many
valid reasons for the use of cloning.

“It will contribute a fair amount to
food production _
and drug pro-
d u c t i o n ,\”
Meisel said.
“So I think that
it is in society’s
interest for
there to be
cloning of ani-

cure for a disease that also effects peo-
ple.”

Cloning may also be useful in help-
ing to produce better animal organs to

be used ‘in human organ transplants.

The pigs born to PPL Therapeutics, also
responsible for Dolly the sheep which
was the first ‘animal to be successfully

cloned, all carry altered genes that may

reduce the chance of organ rejection
when the organs are transplanted into
humans.

If these pigs
can be cloned to pro-

  
 

offspring with this
gene, then the rate of
animal organ rejec-
tion in humans could
be greatly reduced.

 
   

ma1s.”'
Dr. Michael Gorin, who is the inter-

. im chair of the department of human

genetics at the University of Pittsburgh,
agrees that animal cloning is an impor-
tant scientiﬁc tool when used responsi-
bly.

One of the ways Gorin sees cloning
as useful is when it is used to reproduce
an animal that has a rare disease — for
example, the cloning of a cat that has a
rare disease which also effects people.

' ; By cloning that cat, Groin said,
“Then we have a way of trying to find a

This could result in a
potentially endless supply of organs for
ailing people. .

Animals OK, But Humans?

According to Gorin, the technology

already exists to clone an entire person.

However, he feels that it would be “pro-
fessional suicide” to attempt to do so
since there is no real purpose.

“There are people crazy enough to
want to do something just to show that
they can do it,” Gorin said. “But some-
one having the same genetics as some-

duce more and more

one else does not mean it is the same
person.”

Even though the people will have
the same genes, they will be inﬂuenced
by different environmental factors and
will become their own unique persons.

So the idea of someone wanting an
exact replica of himself or herself is just
plain impossible.

Meisel agrees that cloning humans
would serve no real purpose. He feels
that if we began cloning people, it
would be near impossible for the gov-

‘eminent to regulate.

Banning cloning in the United
States will not keep it from happening
in foreign countries.

As of today, there are no federal
regulations imposed on the research of
any type of cloning. As long a compa-
nies are using private funds, they can
clone whatever they want, including
humans.

Pick and Choose? "

Gorin said we do not yet possess
the technology to control such factors
as eye color or height. Scientists do not
fully know what other implications it
will have on. the genetic makeup of
humansto change one gene.

“I’m a mental patient, they don’t
believe me,” she stated. '

Wahl said she feels lucky to have
found a psychologist who, having heard
similar stories from others, said he under-
stands. “It made all the difference in the
World to hear him say that, because other-
wise you feel likera liar.”

ECT does not cause permanent mem-
ory loss in most people, according to psy-
chiatrists, nor should it interfere with one’s
ability to learn.

“There have been millions of dollars
spent researching this issue,” said Dr.
Benoit Mulsant, medical‘ director of ECT
at WPIC. “Scientific evidence provesp.
most do not get severe memory loss prob-
lems.”

Memory impairment resulting from
the depression itself can be troublesome
and persist for those left untreated, he
added. But some of the memory loss from
ECT was minor when compared with the
improved quality of life for the patients.
However, he conceded that some memory
loss can exist.

As with any medical treatment, com-
plications and risks are involved, Mulsant
said. “Even Tylenol has risks. There is a
one in 10,000 chance of your bleeding to
death.” The same mortality odds are true
for ECT patients, he asserted. .

No deaths have been reported at
WPIC related to ECT, according to
Mulsant. But with Texas and Illinois being
the only states that require hospitals to
record deaths occurring within 14 days
following shock, a thorough national or
local count is nebulous. In Texas, reported

noted 100 percent of those tested suffered
some degree of memory loss, even though
many denied any impairments.

Sterling has been tracking ECT for
more than 25 of his 30 years at'Penn. ECT
is used as an “experimental tool” by neu-
roscientists, he wrote in a Jan. 20 article
entitled, “ECT Damage Is Easy to Find If
You Look for It,” in Nature, a leading
international science journal.

Scientists use ‘ECT to produce the
massive quantity of glutamate that occurs
during a seizure. This same mass of gluta-
mate is a cause of neuronal death or brain
damage in stroke victims.

“If you pass 150 volts across some-
body’s head, you’re likely to cause brain
damage,” he said.

But Brian (who chose to exclude his
surname), a 36-year-old from Chicago,
said his treatments 2 1/2 years ago have

‘ helped to regulate the disturbances that

drove him to the brink of suicide. “I was
becoming a wreck, digressing,” he
exclaimed.

After going to the doctor because of
severe sleep problems that left him con-
fused and disorganized throughout the
day, Brian was diagnosed with bipolar dis-
order, or manic depression, and was pre-
scribed a series of shock treatments by a
psychiatrist. ~

“I was afraid, but at that point I
thought, what do I have to lose?” said
Brian, who underwent treatment without
telling family or friends because of the
stigma associated with shock.

Brian remembers waking up in pain ,
following his treatments. “I won’t lie, it.

memory was vividand still is. ‘‘I’m sure "

EDITORIAL

Celebrities may

grab attention,

but don’t trivialize other victims

Rosie O’Donnell recently
joined the ranks of the Million
Mom March, a demonstration dedi-
cated to promoting gun control. She
received a lot of attention for this,
got her‘ picture in a few papers, and
even footage on the evening news.
One million moms beneﬁted from
her vigil. Good for her.

But if O’Donnell hadn’t put her
foot down, would anyone care?

Indeed, would anyone care
about Parkinson’s Disease if
Michael J. Fox hadn’t come out of
the medical closet? Should radia-
tion patients carry in their wallets a
picture of Tom Greene, whose
image is now inseparable from the
plight of testicular cancer?
Celebrities have become the
spokespeople for human suffering,
making Hollywood not only a
dream factory but a glitzy spotlight
shining on today’s problems. For
selective ailments, issues and.
underdogs, there’s an old superstar
out there claiming to be its patron
saint.

Christopher Reeves is a ﬁne

‘example. Since his spinal injury,

Reeves has drawn massive media

: attention to wheelchair-bound acci-

dent’ victims. His "book and inter-

’ » _ views‘ have helped further public
-interest inmedicine and handicap-

accessible facilities.

That’s great, but paraplegics
didn’t just sprout out of the ground
on the day Reeves became para-

lyzed. Because he’s famous, Reeves :

becomes a martyr for the cause;
when laypeople think of wheel-
chairs, they think, ‘.‘poor
Superman.” Never mind the other
millions of similar victims.

There are two beneﬁts of
celebrity attention: First, the reac-
tion is widespread and immediate.
Second, people unfamiliar with cer-
tain issues can attach them to con-
crete faces and names. Magic
Johnson bears the sad smile that
came to represent the crisis. ,His res-

-» ignation from basketball is a‘

metaphor for the lives destroyed by
the HIV virus. '

But no matter how many funds
and foundations a celebrity may
propagate, it’s important not to rate
their lives above the rest. Kids are
shooting kids; most recently, a kid
shot a teacher in Florida.

' Rosie O’Donnell may catch our
eye, make us criticize the world we
live in, but we should not revamp
gun control as the O’Donnel1

‘Cause. Just being an adoptive

mother in a, ﬁrearm-infested world
doesn’t make her the only fright-
ened person, even if it’s only Rosie
who is center stage before a crowd
of faceless extras.

' After-school ‘specials and made—for-TV
movies are usually little more than melodra-
mas starring has-been actors. But “Cheaters,”
an HBO original movie starring Jeff Daniels
as Dr. Gerard Plecki, stirs emotion and pro-
vides a forum for moral debate.

“Cheaters” is a simple story, but the
issues it addresses are much more complex:
What is cheating,and is cheating ever OK?

The movie, based on a true story, takes
place in t 1994 in downtown Chicago.
Steinmetz, a city school, decides.to enter the
National Academic Decathlon. However, the

“rough around the edges” kids don’t stand a ~-

chance against the well-oiled machine that is
Whitney Young, a neighboring and some-
what corrupt high school, which
has won the competition for..the
last 10 years.

Eking a ﬁfth place at the
regional competition, Steinmetz
miraculously earns a spot in the
Illinois state competition. The night before

- the state event, one of the team members,

Irwin, steals a copy of the test. The Steinmetz
team and their coach unanimously decide to
use the newly-found information to cheat. ’
Contrary to the adage, cheaters do win, at
least temporarily. The Steinmetz team and

the school it represents go through a series of ~

highs and lows that ultimately ends in a low.
The scandal breaks. They all get caught,

4 but no one is punished. Of course the team is

stripped of its medals and title and Dr. Plecki
is fired, but life goes on at Steinmetz; no
charges are ﬁled.

I “Cheaters” is a disturbing little ﬁlm (or
“depressing,” as my mother put it), and it
challenges us all to examine our deﬁnition of
cheating.

Although cheating is most often associat-

ed with tests and school work, the monster’

slinks into nearly every aspect of life. It lurks
in the business world, sports, marriage and
lifestyle. We cheat on our taxes, our spouses
and our diets. Everyone, from the purest of
the pure to the ﬁlthiest of the ﬁlthy, has
cheated on something during,his or her life.

Do the cheaters laugh last?

LAUREN

 

And as sure as you’ve cheated, you’ve ratio-
nalized it away -— unless, of course, you
were caught.

Cheating is a beast that creeps, sneaks
and boasts charisma. It makes prorrrises and
offers rewards, sometimes even delivering
them. Webster throws around synonyms like
fraud, deceit, violation and dishonesty to
describe the creature, but cheating is still dif-
ﬁcult to deﬁne. Perhaps we make it more dif-

ﬁcult than it has to be because deep down we ~

want to blur the deﬁnition of cheating, . just
like we want to blur the line between good
and bad and right and wrong. This way, we

- aren’t accountable for our actions. This way,

rationalization can pull its mighty sword and
chop the monster into itsy bitsy

pieces — pieces so small that
they look nothing like ‘cheating

claiming that you earned a few pennies less
than you actually did? The government
makes enough off me already. Cybersex? It
was only on-line. I don’t even know the per-
son. Eating two cookies but only counting
one? It was a fat-free cookie. Where the mon-
ster lurks, rationalization is never far behind.

Rationalization is a dangerous creature.
It dissolves lying into ﬁbbing, stealing into
borrowing, and killing into defending. And it
confuses what we knew implicitly as a child
— right from wrong, good from bad.

“Obviously we made a‘ few mistakes-

here,” Dr. Plecki says to his team as
“Cheaters” closes.

“Yeah, like getting caught, for one,” a
student replies.

It has been said that a man’s true charac-
ter is measured by what he does when no
one’s watching. How do you measure up?

Lauren Shurtz is a recovering cheater: She
has taken several extra fat-free cookies.

shoots Chon and Roy (Owen Wilson) into the crazy,
slapstick world that every Jackie Chan fan knows and
loves.

In their search for the princess, Roy and Chon
befriend a tribe of Crow, alienate a town, and
encounter a Chinese immigrant camp, slaving away to
build a railroad. Their boss, Lo Fong (Roger Yaun), is
holding Princess Pei-Pei for a hefty ransom. This is
where the reliance on stereotypes for humor starts to
fall apart.

The slavery of the railroad workers is addressed,
but putting Lo Fong’s character in charge of the immi-
grants and reaping all of the monetary beneﬁts for
himself is a little far-fetched — that white capitalists
would treat him with respect is just plain silly.

“All the good boys know that
you can’t always say what you
want,” accordiiig to Mathlete, at
least. ,

Thank goodness this doesn’t go
for people like me who have to pre-
view a crappy band. VV1th that said,
if you like music with a good beat
and an electronic sound, Mathlete is
right up your alley.

Sadly, this is about all you’ll get
at the June 2 concert held at the Mr.
Roboto Project in VV1lkinsburg ‘fea-
turing Mathlete. The concert is pro-
moting their ﬁrst full-length album,
Telstar Parthenon. Since their 1997
birth, this will be the band’s first trip
to Pittsburgh.

The sound of the CD can be cat-

egorized as anything from synth-
pop, Casiocore to new wave and
electronic pop. Don’t get me wrong,
these guys have some great ideas
and are worth a listen, but they need
to take more than eight months to
write, produce and issue a 20-song
CD.

What they produce is creatively
done, but it isn’t a promise of any
talent. If you take away all the frills
of the music, you’re left with some

‘ pretty simplistic melodies or even

worse — something you recognize
as a bad ‘80s hit.

Songs such as “All My Singing
Friends” (which the opening quote
is from, by the way), “Steel Wheels
‘89” and “An Afternoon
Emergency” are my prediction for
the CD’s hits. The lyrics, though not
memorable for their profound
nature, are perfect for a summer

they did to thisalbum. I

Unfortunately, A the sing-along
groupies will have a challenge as all
the vocals have been put through
one electronic mechanism or anoth-
er. In some cases, this is a plus. In
others, it seems that the singer is try-
ing to hide the fact that he may have
a horrid voice. V

Many of the other electronic
devices Mathlete used on their new
disc remind me of the music from
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show”
and, in his ﬁner moments, Moby.

I have never seen ,
Mathlete live, but hope
they bring as much
enthusiasm to the stage as

Crossing over the Bloomfield

students who live in Oakland. Here’s a
news ﬂash, though  there is a pedes-
trian lane! And for crossing that bridge
this Friday, you will be rewarded with
a showcase of some of Pittsburgh’s
best bands, and a few foreign ones as
well. -

Coolpepper’s Hothouse is the des-
ignated site for this all—ages show fea-
turing local acts Grand Buffet, Dean
Swagger and H.A.R.M., plus out—of—
towners Captain Bigwheel and J epetto.

Grand Buffet is probably the best
thing Pittsburgh has going, musically
that is. They ‘ get the Beastie Boys
comparison a lot —— they rap, they’re
white — but they also get compared to
them because they’re good (they
opened for Run—D.M.C.). Grand
Buffet’s into stunts, like jumping off
the wall of sound, a speaker, doing
kung fu, playing a toy guitarand
drinking bubble solution to show the

,audience a “new kind of straight \

edge.” Grand Buffet also rocks
because they stay for all the other
bands. And you should too.

It’s hard to remember sometimes
when listening to a movie sound-
track that most of the songs in the
given film are heard for less than 20
seconds. That’s why it’s jarring to
realize   A

 

pretty much figure out where and
when they were woven into the
montage. Track one, the Eel’s “Mr.

What really fails this album,
though, aside from some of the
 «music, is

in near proximity to Run—D.M.C.
just showcases his utter lack of tal-

The diagetic music in a film is
supposed to further the narrative
and fill in, gaps in the action, but lis-
tening to the “Road Trip” sound-
track only makes me realize that too
much attention was paid to helping
the film along and not enough in
producing a quality accompaniment
to it. a

Most of these songs are better
heard in small doses.

Although there were no scheduled meets
this past week, the Pitt track team eamed two
individual awards given in the Mid-Atlantic
Region. L

Head track and field coach Steve Lewis
was named the Outdoor Coach of the Year by
the U.S. Track Coaches Association.

In addition, senior Chantee Earl was
named the Mid-Atlantic Region Women’s
Track Athlete of the Year.

Lewis, in his 16th year as head coach of
the Panthers, led the women’s team to a sec-
ond-place finish at the Eastern College
Athletic Conference Outdoor Championships
and a sixth-place finish in the Big East

From 1994-99, Lewis has coached at
least one NCAA champion and directed the
women to a top—20 ﬁnish in the NCAA cham-
pionships.

2 One of those NCAA champions is
Trecia-Kaye Smith, who is now an assistant
coach for the Panthers.

The Panther with a shot at a national title
next week is Earl,,who won the 800 meters at
both the ECAC and Big East Outdoor cham-

held at Duke University, starting today and
running through Saturday.‘

Additionally, Earl has not lost an 800
race in the indoor or outdoor seasons all sea-
son long. She owns the school record in the
event in both the indoor (2:02.19) and the
outdoor (2:03. 14). \

Earl already won the NCAA indoor title

in the 800 and will also compete in the 1,600-.

Pitt Stadium is no more. In its place
stands an arena of dirt and stone, its borders,
a hill where bleachers once rested under
cramped fans.

Pitt football will be relocated to -Three
Rivers Stadium this year, and to the new
Steelers stadium being constructed on the
North Side in 2001. _

Oakland can not be what it was during
the 78. years that the enormous stadium
stood on Cardiac Hill. '

But this is not the ﬁrst time Oakland has
gone through such a change.

“There was a time when part of ﬂie fas-
cination of going to Pitt was everything
going on hi and around the campus, and that
will never be recaptured,” said Jim O’Brien,
a 1964 Pitt graduate who has written many
books about Pittsburgh sports history.

Much ‘ of Pitt’s allure, O’Brien says,
came from the wide variety of sports that

. Duquesne

Oakland had to offer, including at Pitt

From 1909 until 1970, the Pirates
played their home games at Forbes Field on
the land where Posvar Hall is located.

. “Kids from Iowa who couldn’t see
major league games co11ld walk into Forbes
Field after the seventh inning of a ball game
for free,” O’Brien said.

Of course, Forbes Field is most famous
for the Bill Mazeroski home rim ﬂrat won
the World Series for the Pirates in 1960. A

Y‘ decade later, thebuilding became antiquated
and the team moved to Three Rivers

Stadium 3 ,

And in 1895, asmall arena on Fifth
Avenue and North Craig Street named the
Gardens 1 housed -several
Pittsburgh hockey teams and hosted some of
the most prominent boxing matches of the
day until it was tom down in the 1950s.‘ ,

The Gardens were gone by the time

OfBrien came to college, but Pitt Stadium
and Forbes Field suﬂiced for his sports expe- '

rience.
. “I grew up four miles ﬁom Pitt in
Hazelwood, but it was as if Oakland was

another world,” he said. “I thought it was the ’
. greatest place in the worl ” '

The Duquesne Gardens

Tom “Scoop” Saulsbury 
what he did when the Duquesne Gardens

- was knocked down in 1956.,

“I cried,” said_§;Sa1ﬂsbury, who ﬁrst
worked at the Gardens in 1952 as a stickboy
and assistant trainer for the Hornets,
Pittsburgh’s . American Hockey League
team. '

‘Hell yeah, I did. I got a brick around
here somewhere,” he said. .

The Gardens, which housed most of

‘Pittsburgh’s hockey games until the Civic

Arena came into existence and was the
venue for many of the nation’s greatest box-
ing matches, had an unusual start

“It was an old streetcar barn,” said
Saulsbury, who worked with the Hornets
until they disbanded in 1967. He then
Worked with the Penguins at the Civic Arena
until his 1985 retirement.

The Gardens, which sat on the property
on Fifth Avenue where the Park Plaza

1 Condominiums and Duranti’s Restaurant sit

today, was constructed sometime in 1890 for
the Duquesne Traction Company. Then, ﬁve

9 _ years later, the two-story brick building was

converted into a skating rink and auditorium.
The single tier of bleachers could seat
about 5,000 people, who, Saulsbury said,

were “really stuffed in there.”
1 ‘The best seat was behind the goal.

Whenl was in the eighth grade, whenl start- .
‘ ed going to games, I’d get the 60-cent tickets

to sit behind the goal.”

But the Duquesne Gardens was not
only a home to hockey.

“There was always something going on

‘ there,” Saulsbury said .

The Ice Capades, the roller derby, the
circus and the Metropolitan Opera all held
their events at the Duquesne Gardens.

THE Pin News -.,,,..r

Before the Civic Arena’s construction,
Duquesne University’s basketball team
played its home games there. Before
Saulsbury’s time, in 1938, there was even a
marathon dance competition, in which Art
Ferrar of Shaler won by moving around for
523 hours. I

And, of course, there were also many
boxing ﬁghts, headlined by bouts including
Fritzie Zivic and Billy Conn.

But while the sporting events and fans
made the Duquesne Gardens such an
endearing place to people like Saulsbury, the
Oakland community was also part of its
charm L .,

“A lot of the guys would go to Mass at
St Paul’s Cathedral before games, like I
did,” hesaid. ; g -

Forbes Field .

“Two events ﬂamed my college experi-
ence at Pitt,” said O’Brlen, who is currently
working on a book that celebrates Forbes
Field. 5 5’

“WhenIwas afreshman,Iwasinthe
Student Union when ‘Maz’ hit the home run

in game 7 (of the 1960 World Series). As a '

senior, I was in the same block when I heard

1 that JFK was shot.”

While the signiﬁcance of the two histor-
ical events are noticeably incomparable,
such was the life of a sports fan in Pittsburgh
during the 1960s.

“Forbes Field is one of the great ball-
parks,” said Bob Friend, a right-handed
pitcher who started for the Pirates from
1951-1966;

 ";‘The players liked playing there

because it was such a unique ﬁeld,” Friend
said

The inﬁeld was grass, “ﬁrm and hard,”
as Friend remembers, but “everyone com-
plained about the crooked third base line.”

. The route between home and third was noto-

rious for its uneven bumps and even more
uneven bounces it caused batted balls to
The third—base line nearly knocked out
New York Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek
during the famous last game in the 1960
Series. '

. “The ball jumped off the groundand hit

him in the throat,” Friend said .

-“That was Forbes Field That was part
of the charm” ’ 5 ' 1

* The outﬁeld was even more. While
most of the modem stadiums’ outﬁeld walls
are in the shape of an arch, Forbes’ dimen-
sions were completely its own.

Left ﬁeld’s fence was 356 feet away
from home, left center "was 405, center was
457 and the power alley in right center was
385. 5 1

‘Then there was that right-ﬁeld cement
wall that Clemente played so well,’.’ Friend
remembered ‘There was no padding on it

for awhile, and they eventually  on‘ arub— ,

ber barrier.” . A

colleges released the salaries of their
employees.

Look at John Cooper of Ohio
State. He’s coached the team for a
decade, but they have never won a
national title. They’ve come close on
many occasions, but have never won
it all under Cooper. The Buckeyes fill
up a 100,000-seat stadium every
Saturday afternoon in the fall, but the
fans in Columbus, would show up
whether the team was 11-0 or 0-11.
Yet Cooper gets $1.2 million per year
under a contract extension he signed
last year.

At Pitt, Harris is in the middle of
turning the program into a college
football powerhouse. If Pitt makes a‘

bowl this year, which is a -very dis-
tinct possibility, then Harris will have
been well worth his salary.

You don’t hear people in Florida
complaining that Steve Spurrier’s
salary is more than $2 million per
year. That’s because they know how
important the football program is to
the university.

Those in power at Pitt have to
realize that Harris is one of the most
important people at the University,
and should be paid accordingly.

Joe Patemo makes at least $1 rnil-
lion at Penn State which doesn’t

-include his income from football

camps and shoe contracts, and he’s
128 years old! Harris is 53 years old,

' so his pay is definitely a bargain com-

pared to the senile head coach on the
other side of the state.

Don’t tell me Paterno isn’t senile.
He has to be if he thinks his team is
the best in the country every year.

He’s also senile if he thinks
Rashard Casey is innocent of beating
up an off-duty cop in Hoboken, N.J.,
last. month.

But anyway, let’s get back to the
main point. Harris’ new deal is a bar-
gain. He’s one of the best coaches in
the nation, yet still one of the lowest
paid. He may not have proven himself
yet, but in a few years, people will be
praising Pitt athletics director Steve
Pederson for making this deal.

They would wheel it out there after batting
practice was over,” Friend said.

If the ball hit the cage, the batter would
be awarded a ground-rule double.

To add to the challenging conditions,
there was a monument to original owner
Barney Dreyfuss in center ﬁeld.

“The View of center ﬁeld from the
mound was of Schehley Park and some of

the ClVIU buildings,” Friend said. “It was a .

truly beautiful sight.”

Friend said that Forbes Field was
thought of as a hitter’s park. ' A
“It had ivy spreading up the [outﬁeld] wall
and ‘players could pick the ball up well
[against ﬂue dark green contrast].”

- Forbes seated anywhere from 35,000 to
40,000 fans, many‘ of whom were from the
local colleges and surroundingarea. ..

‘”Ihere were 50-cent seats in left ﬁeld,”
Friend said “Most of the people out there
had no shirts, and were drinking beer and
raising hell. It was great”

The Oakland community played an
important role in the success of the ballpark
and gave it its sense of home. 1

Many players would go to Frankie
Gustine’s bar on Forbes Avenue after

games. Gustine played third base for the ‘

Pirates from 1939-48.

Likewise, many players from opposing
teams could be seen in or'around the
Schenley Hotel, now the Wﬂharn Pitt
Union, where they would stay because. of
the building’s prestige and obvious conve-
nient access to the park '

But while Friend and his teammates
were emotionally attached to Forbes Field,
they recognized ﬂrat it had its problems.
Among them were a series of poles and
posts that blocked the View of many fans.

“I think most of us felt pretty bad about
it, hoping they might be able to modernize

it,” Friend said. “But they left Oakland and . 0’
"Forbes Field for Three Rivers Stadium,

which hasn’t been a good baseball ﬁeld.”
AndthatiswhythePiratesare1eaving'

it for PNC Park, a throwback ballﬁeld that is

also being constructed on the North Side.

’ “You know it’s amazing that after all these

30 years, the franchises are going back to the
older-styled stadiums,” Friend said. “The
new one is going to be a beauty, with the
grass, the intimate seating and the fans close
to the players. And that’s the way the game
was supposed to be played”

' But-while Friend looks forward to the
new stadium on the North Side, he gladly
and fondly reﬂects on Forbes Field. ,

O’Brien, the historian, echoes Friend’s . .1

sentiments. L_ V
“It’s something I don’t ever want to for-
get.” ’
