police profiling

TUESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2002

In April 2001 a system was
developed by a faculty and student
committee to prevent racial profiling
oncampus. But some,’ including Pitt
police‘ Chief Timothy Delaney
believe a similar system is already in
place. A D ' 1

In January 2001, SGB unani-
mously passed a 10-point resolution
to combat racial profiling on campus
"which included three primary
actions to be taken by Pitt police

Cries for a revolution rang out
as the_ Kuntu Repertory Theatre
honored Martin Luther King, Jr.
with its performance titled “Lift
Every Voice and Sing.”"

Held in the auditorium ‘of the
Graduate School of Public Health,
the presentation was a montage of
speeches by King, dance pieces,
poems and other writings that
expressed the experiences of blacks
during troubled times and ‘certain
historical events__ in the black com-

munity.

According to Kuntu’s founder
and" Pitt professor Dr. Vernell Lillie,
Black Action Society, the event’s

. sponsor‘, first commissoned the per-

formance in 1986. «
The production, arranged and
directed by Lillie, began with four
female performers dancing as six
male performers stood on the
room’s elevated landing, while
singing the gospel song, “Let My
People Go.” , . '
King’s famous “I Have‘ a
Dream” speech teased the audience
as performer Charles Timber recited

Fast

only a section of it, while the
speech was printed in its entirety in
the program. Lillie used King’s
work “Trumpet of Conscience” as
the inspiration for the five-scene
production. “Trumpet of
Conscience” details King’s desire
for international involvement in
socialchange. g

The actors played out several
historical events for the audience,
including the death of Emmit Till, a
black man who was beaten to death
for looking at a white woman.

The audience sat in silence as

‘screams rang out from the perform- '

ers portraying the four black girls
who were killed in a Birmingham,
Ala., church. The monumental
scene of Rosa Parks refusing to
give up her bus seat was also recre-
ated. ’

Dramatic dance numbers chore-
ographed and performed by Milton
J. Henderson and other members of
the cast served as transitions
between the play’s acts and move-
ments.

At the end of the performance
the cast stepped into the audience
and asked everyone to hold hands
while singing “Lift Every Voice and

Kuntu Theatre celebrates King  

Sing,” the song considered to be the
black national anthem.

After the show concluded, after
much applause, Lillie held a discus-
sion group about King and the sig-
nificance of the piece as the 10-
member cast sat on the stage.

“I think King had far more than
we’ve thought about,” Lillie said.

A few minutes later, Lillie
revealed that the night’s show was
dedicated to Dr. Dennis Brutus‘, a
professor emeritus in .Pitt’s depart-
ment of Africana studies, whom she
referred to as a “national and inter-
national treasury.” g
. “The event is about Dr. King
and ‘what he did...Different people
have different views about him,”
Brutus said.

“If Dr. King was here tonight,
he would say ‘we have a new fight
on our hands.”’ _

Cast member Joyce Arridelle, a
corrections officer in Greensburg,
agreed with Brutus’s feelings.

“For me, it was a reenactment of
what’s going on today...like a call-
ing to people to wake up,” Arridelle
said. “If we don’t change as a peo-
ple, we will just keep on repeating
our history.’’ ’

Local grassroots group aims to attract Gen X-ers

ERIK ARROYO
Staff ‘Writer

I Myron Cope will spend his time star-
ing at pedestrians from the front of the
Skinny Building this week. ’

But don’t ask the long-time Steelers
broadcaster for an autograph. Only
Cope’s ﬁve-foot wide face will be there,
mounted in 12 windows of the six—foot
wide structure at the comer of Forbes
Avenue and Wood Street Downtown.

.In anticipation of the Steelers’ play-
off run, the Ground Zero Action Network
—— a grassroots organization of local
architects, artists, building preservation-

. ists and high-tech industry workers—— is

coordinating the artwork to capitalize on

the spotlight placed on Pittsburgh by the A

National Football League playoffs. _
Ground Z‘ero’s goal is to make
Pittsburgh a more attractive city to young
people, particularly those in their 20s.
The group’s members hope to do this
through a series of projects they initiate,

manage and produce throughout the/city.“

to keep current residents and attract new
ones in that age group.
According to Christine Brill, a mem-

ber of Ground Zero, the group wants to.

create and sustain a network of resources
aimed at emiching Pittsburgh with an
environment of creative culture and

regional pride. She said that Pitt students it

are the link to continuing that unique
local history. _

“«[Ground Zero] really hopes to make
stronger connections with all university
communities,” Brill said. “The idea is to
bring individuals together to connect and
create a real support network enabling
projects to happen.”

The group was instrumental in creat-
ing the Ultraviolet shuttle, or UV Loop, a

Port Authority Transitbus, which began '

running Sept. 7, 2001, and stops at sever-
al intersections along Fifth Avenue on
Pitt’s campus. The.,shuttle connects the
business districts of Pittsburgh’s 88
neighborhoods, including the _Strip
District, Bloomﬁeld, East Liberty,

an instant hit with Pitt students.

“The UV bus gave me a chance to
see parts of the city that I would not have
been able to see ifI had just taken a'reg-
ular city bus,” said Matt Michalik, a
freshman from Philadelphia. “Plus, every
time I was on the shuttle, I was with other
college students, not like on a regul
bus.” ' , 4

Sophomore Heather Snyder said that
the UV Loop gave her a chance to shop

‘ and enjoy the atmosphere of areas that

would normally be out of reach for her.
“I’m notfrom this city,‘ and I don’t
really know where everything is yet, so I

Profiling committee asks police to collect data

Profiling, page 1

lished a working group to decide on
a plan to combat racial profiling.
University spokesman Robert Hill
said the committee was established
“to review the recommendation that
came out of the [SGB] resolution.”
According to Dworin, the com-
mittee consisted of Vice Provost

‘Birney Harrigan, Dean of Students

Jack Daniel, Delaney, Pitt police
Cmdr. Kathy Schreiber, former Pitt
police Chief Deborah Furka, former
SGB members Dworin and Sara

Dadlani, former SGB President Mike‘

Unangst and Black Action Society
President Dionne Hayden.

The working committee met
through March and by the end of the
month a plan similar to the SGB res.-
olution was drafted.

The plan asked the University to
collect data regarding all contact

between the public and the Pitt.

police, mandate diversity training
for police officers, link minority
groups with police, ask all officers to
sign a certificate of integrity, create
a biannual forum to discuss events
and issues, publish a pamphlet
informing students of their rights
and design Pitt police business cards
with the phone numbers of a student

administrator to contact with com-
plaints. ,

' But now, after all the delibera-
tions of the working committee,
many wonder if the police are fol-
lowing through on

information including name, date,
date of birth, age, social security

explained that a sys-
tem similar to that
of the committee’s
plan was already in
effect at the time the . '
resolution" was passed and while the
committee was deliberating.

He added that he was never able
to communicate to the committee
that a system already existed. For
Delaney, the decision of the commit-
tee represented a need for further
improvement in his existing system.

B u s i n e s s
cards also already
existed ‘before the
committee’s deci-
sion. The difference
between Delaney’s cards and the

‘cards proposed by the committee is
that the pre-existing cardfdoes not

include the -number of a university
administrator.

Delaney feels that all com-
plaints should be made directly. to
the police department so that it can
be dealt with as quickly and thor-‘

.-

oughly as possible. An administrator,
Delaney said, amounts to a middle-
man. . '
“They’re asking the complaint
not come-to me,” Delaney said.

As far as printing “Know Your
Rights” information, the, Student
Code of Conduct explains civil
rights, but Delaney wants to go even
further. He said he is in the process
of making himself and the police
department more accessible to stu-
dents. He is working to design a Web

site that should be up and running.

S0011.

Delaney’ said the Web I site, K
www.pitt.edu/~police, will include

complaint forms for students to fill
out, tips for both students and par-
ents outlining what to do if you come
in contact with a police officer, the
publication of crime alerts and noti-
fications and a list of victim service
information ‘sites and sources. The
site will be advertised to students on
cards,—magnets and student informa-
tion sources to make .it an easily
available resource-. A - _
’ Delaney’s main goal inspired by
the discussions of thexcommittee is
to improve his system. “I am making
moves to show what we do .and make
it accessible to the University,”ihe
said. -

Vocational and technical
8 education a Viable option

A Pennsylvania state education
commission report released in
December indicated that vocational and
technical education is underfunded and
stigmatized. The report reveals what
many people already knew: that a four-
year college education is often seen as
the only way to ﬁnancial success.

The problem is that the stigma often
attached to vocational and technical
education needlessly prevents students
and their parents from considering the
option. ,

The stigma is undeserved. While
vocational and technical school students
are often stereotyped as the “dumb” or
“bad” students from a particular school
district, the reality is that they are gain-
ing technical skills desperately needed
for today’s economy. Rather than sim-
ply allowing themselves to be pushed

along the bachelor’s degree track,_

which has basically become the norm,
they have considered their options and
chosen technical skills.

Furthermore, vocational education
experts dispute the perception that the

‘ only way to get ahead in life is via a

four-year degree. According to the
Director of Career Development for the
Pittsburgh Public Schools, Johnson
Martin, as quoted in ~Monday’s

Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, only about
20 percent of jobs in the United States
require a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Furthermore, 83 percent of people with
associate degrees earn as much money
as people with four-year degrees.

So not only is it the case that col-
lege may not be the right" option for
everyone, but clearly it is not the case
that it is the only way to get a comfort-
able job. '

Additionally, as the economy con-
tinues to decline, technical skills may be
just what students need to get jobs.
When the economy sours, people can
stop buying computers, but they still get
sick and their cars still break down.

The statewide economy would ben-
eﬁt from increased numbers of skilled
workers. Employers report a shortage of
skilled labor necessary for -growing
companies. And as the economy contin-
ues to become increasingly service- and
technology-based, the need for skilled
workers will continue to increase.

Parents and students should consid-
er vocational and technical school a
viable educational opportunity.
Furthermore, the state should increase
funding in order to help develop indus-
tries and increase the number of "skilled
laborers in the workforce.

FindingPittpride ina
 gently used ‘92 J etta

' JAMES DEWEESE
Staff Writer

As I watched my friends pull out of
the parking lot of what is arguably the
world’s largest ﬂuorescent orange tourist
trap —— conveniently located not far from
my parents’ home in Little Rock, S.C. --
my thoughts immediately turned north.

Bathed in the multi-colored neon light of ‘

the decorations adorning the tacky shops.
at South of the Border, I felt closer to Pitt
than I ever had before. _
Just a few days before, as wewalked
the conidors of the Magic Kingdom in
Disney World, a friend asked me what I
thought needed to happen to make Pitt a
warmer, fuzzier place — the kind of place

that inspires that almost mythic nostalgic .

fondness for one’s alma mater. Until that
trip found the ﬁve of us — technically
adults — on the verge of wetting our pants
with excitement on rides designed for
children and early teens, I would have
considered myself ill-equipped to answer
that question.

Over my years at Pitt I always thought
I was too cool for school. I was a Panther

' fan, but I’d never even worn a Pitt T-shirt.

I didn’t join a club. And I certainly didn’t
do much to seek out anyone who had an

interest in anything other than cynical cri- -

tiques of school pride. _
After three and half years —— punctu-
ated by study abroad and a stint with
AmeriCorps — it had become nearly
impossible for me to see a point to college
life beyond the utilitarian goal of putting

» in my time to’ get a degree. Itturns out

that’s about as far ﬁom the truth as Florida
is from the ‘Burgh. -

As ﬁve of us made our way to

?:§’£§IlIl£iI,!LII3*.

Orlando one unseasonably warm week in
December,‘ every mile the odometer
clicked off carried me a little further from
the Pittsburgh surroundings that I’d rarely
left over the semester. Even as we moved

away from Pittsburgh, each mile marker
- that whizzed by the window of the over-
burdened, frighteningly low-riding J etta _
brought me a little closer to the true mean- _

ing of Pitt. .

The trip itself was the product of col-
legiate spontaneity at its_ purest. Plans to
see the Panthers take on and ultimately
trounce North, Carolina State University
began to take shape as soon as the first tan-
gerine hit the ground at Heinz Field. It was

Road trip s :
Jetta, page 10 .

lis that is Wytheville, Va. There they col-
lected Mario, took a quick tour of the town
and departed that same morning at 2 a.m.

Last on the list, and therefore blessed
with an extra night’s rest, I got ready to
leave my house in Little Rock, S.C., just as
the crew pulled punctually onto the rni1e—
and—a-half long stretch of blacktop and dirt
that links my home to state Highway 9.
They arrived at precisely 7:02 a.m. I spec-
ify the time because the driver openly
adrnits having risked not only his own life
but those of the other passengers as well,
swerving around cars and careening over
gravel patches of shoulder just to prove
that they could indeed arrive exactly on
time.

At the time, I thought I could have
used another couple hours of sleep before
we left for Florida. My less-than—sunny
disposition that morning made this abun-
dantly clear to me. Now, in retrospect, I
wish we had left even earlier.

As we hurdled south at 85 mph, the

weather steadily became more rerninis- ‘

cent of a balmy day in late spring than one
less than a week before Christmas. We lis-
tened to punk re-mixes of our favorite ‘80s
hits, marveled at real palm trees oddly
supported by 2-by-4s and plywood along-
side the highway; made wildly inaccurate
predictions about the impending game’s

collegiate spontaneity at its best

score; and critiqued the sleeping and eat-
ing patterns of one of us who ,couldn’t
seem to getenough of either.

Over the course of several days in a
car, three nights in hotel rooms, 12 hours
at Disney World, a poor selection of free
food, a $3.99 breakfast buffet at
Ponderosa and a victorious bowl game, .I
was struck by the caliber of the company I
was keeping.

I got to know an aspiring politician,
whose drive and ideals will someday
make him a governor I’d be proud to vote
for. I was inspired by the constant smile,
positive attitude and
offbeat humor of a
girl who will one
day share her
a p a r t m e n t
with a duck

(don’t ask, I don’t know either).'I got over
some of my irrational fear of Maﬁa activ-
ity while chatting with a sports buff who
knows more than your average encyclope-
dia. And I traveled several hundred miles
with someone whose life’s itinerary will
eventually carry him across 15 different
occupations, if all goes "according to plan.

I imagine that opportunities such as
these will become increasingly rare. For

- most of us, life probably won’t come with

few commitments, a three-week winter
break and an unwavering

, ‘ faith in 124,000 mile—o1d

get you where you’re
going.

Wytheville and Little Rock would proba-
bly have never shared a neighborhood in
Pittsburgh. If it weren’t for the freedom
only a college kid knows, the Panthers and
a bowl game, we might never have gotten
to know one another as much as we have.
If it weren’t for those four people and a car
ride in rnid-December, it would probably
have taken a lot more time for me to ﬁg—..

I’m still not sure that I can answer the
question of what will instill a sense of

pride among Pitt students. The laws of a

physics would probably prevent 17,000
undergraduates from ﬁtting into a Jetta at
once. But I- do know that even before my
friends had driven out of sight, I already
felt nostalgia for the road trip and by
extension the many people I’ve met along
the way at Pitt. .

Take‘ a lookaround. Oakland is our

a confined area with so many unique and

Pitt breaks back into the top 25 with last second heroics against Hoyas

WASHINGTON -— No lead is
ever safe.

The Panthers learned this the hard
way as they squandered a 17-point

afternoon, only to come back and win
in the final seconds, pulling out the
68-67 victory at the MCI Center.

Pitt claimed its largest lead of the
game when Donatas Zavackas hit a
three-pointer with 8:39 left in the
game to put the Panthers up 62-45.
But the Hoyas, led by Mike
Sweetney, who finished with a game-
high 24 points, answered back by
going 16 of 18 from the free throw
line.

Missed shots, turnovers and fouls
allowed the Hoyas to close in on the
Panthers, and with just 51 seconds
left on the clock, Georgetown’s Drew

With 11 seconds remaining in the
game, Brandin Knight took a shot
from behind the are looking for the
victory. Though his attempt was no
good, Jaron Brown grabbed the
rebound and put the ball in to give the
Panthers a one-point lead with six
seconds left.

Georgetown had one last shot and
a chance for the win as Hall took a
wide open three point shot as the final
seconds ticked off the clock. Hall’s
shot nearly dropped as it went in the
net and bounced back out, allowing
Pitt to pull out the narrow victory.

“It was a good shot, I’ll live with
that shot,” said Georgetown head
coach Craig Esherick. “Drew was in
rhythm and we got the shot I want-
ed.”

The Pitt Women’s basketball team, in search of a
much needed Big East conference win, brought its

against the West Virginia Mountaineers.

Poor shooting and turnovers plagued the Panthers
throughout the contest, resulting in a loss to the
‘Mountaineers (10-6, 3-3 in the Big East) by a score of
80-63. ' '

Despite plenty of opportunities in the first half,
the Panthers (6-11, 1-5) could not capitalize on their
24 ﬁrst-half rebounds and did not shoot well.

Pitt netted only nine of 31 shots and was two for
eight from three-point range. Guard Laine Selwyn,
who played all 40 minutes, led the ﬁrst half effort for
the Panthers with 11 points and ﬁve rebounds.

Se1wyn’s leadership was not enough as the
Mountaineers ‘handled the Pitt defense with ease en
route to 41 first half points. Guard Kate Bulger spear-
headed the offensive charge for WVU, shooting six of

Normally, Ho_wland would replace Lett with

down his bench, Howland decided to put Chevron

in over two weeks. _ 

No playing time in a while was no problem for

Then just one minute later, Troutman once

for the Panthers, in which they would take a com-
fortable 4.7-38 lead. Troutman didn’t disappoint,
scoring a total of eight points in the game while
picking up threerebounds and two assists.

“We’ve got to get him in the game,” Howland
said. “He had an unbelievable game.”

’ medication and waited patiently for the

room to stop spinning. .

I’m no conspiracy theorist, but on a
hunch I decided to investigate some dis-
appearances that have seemingly gone
unnoticed. /

Derek Bell: This would be a very
good time for me to complain about Cam
Bonifay, but I’m not going to. I’ll just say
that I think'it’s a bad policy to pay $10
million to a player who has one season
worth of good games under his belt over
a ten-year career.

There is nobody in North America
who is more critical of Derek Bell than I
am. He was good in 1998, you say? So

were Rick Helling and Eric Davis. Mo ,

Vaughn hit .337 in 1998. Times change.

Derek vanished into the shadowy
depths of the disabled list after signing a
two-year deal for $10 million. He played
in only 46 games all season and hit .173.
That’s 77 points below his weight.

He has shown no plate discipline to
speak of, having struck out 100 times or
more in ﬁve seasons and averaging just
over 34 walks per year. However, reports
from Pirates mini—camp indicate that Bell
has added 25 pounds of muscle to his
frame and is eager to eam the respect of
the Pittsburghfans. .-

While I don’t think he will return to
his 1998 form, I’d look for a decent surge
in his offensive numbers this year. They
really don’t have anywhere to go but up.

I often lie awake at
night wondering what Cam Bonifay was

thinking.

\ Jose Lind: Ah, who could forget
“Chico?” For anyone who lived in
Pittsburgh between 1987 and 1992, Jose
Lind was a household name.

He was the poor man’s Ozzie Smith,
with less defensive ability and no skill at
the plate whatsoever. Chico left the
majors in 1995 but had trouble staying
out of the limelight.

In November of 1996, he was pulled
over by Florida state troopers and found
to be both totally inebriated and naked
from the waist down. I used to lieawake
at night wondering what ever happened
to players like Jose.

This is probably one of the contribut-
ing factors that have kept me from get-
ting dates for the last ﬁve years. ’

Kid ‘N’ Play: Which one had the tall
hair? I think it was Play, but I could be
wrong. Whatever happened to these
guys? Remember that “House Party”
movie? Ha ha. That was just ridiculous.

Matt Wein is a staﬁ‘ writer for The Pitt
News and he would very much like you to
e-mail him at miw23 @pitt.edu if you can
name another decent Michael Keaton
movie or know the current whereabouts

Panthers within striking distance at 18-
13, but the duo could not fend off the
Mountaineers for long. ,

- ‘The scoring prowess of Bulger and
teammates Sherell Sowho and Yolanda
Paige proved to be too much for Pitt,
who connected on just two ﬁeld goals
in the ﬁnal two minutes of the first half.

Despite out-rebounding the
Mountaineers’ by ‘six, the Panthers
found themselves down 41-26 at the
break. ‘They opened the second half
looking to close the 15-point gap and
improve their shooting.

Pitt was able to score six‘ unan-
swered points_ to open the second half,
bringing the score to 41-32, but the
Mountaineers struck back quickly,
mounting an 11-0 run.

With Bulger contributing five

points and Brandi Batch adding six of

‘Wednesday when

her -own, the run ‘increased West
Virginia’s lead from nine points to 19.
WVU led by as many as.20 points in
the second half. _

Though the Panthers were able to
play a more competitive game in the
second half, they found themselves
unable to compensate for their dismal
ﬁrst-half shooting performance.

Pitt dominated on the boards,

_ pulling down 46 to West Virginia’s 32,

but the Panthers turned the ballover 12
times in each half and shot only 30.3

' percent from the ﬁeld for the game.

Panthers’ guard Brooke Stewart led‘
the team in scoring with 20 points, 13
of which came in the second half.-
Selwyn ﬁnished with 17 points and ten
boards for the double-double. Guard
Haley Harguth added 12 points and
center Bettina Love scored eight points
and pulled down eight boards in the
loss-.

Bulger led WVU as she ﬁnished
with 26 points to lead all scorers. Paige
had’ 14 points and 13 assists, and
Sowho‘ added 17 points for the

win, heading into tonight’s
clash against Orangemen

Heart attack, page 15

half, as they cut an 11-point
Georgetown lead‘ down to three at
halftime, trailing 32-29. The Panthers

"received a boost from an unlikely

source when Chevon Troutman
entered the game because Lett and
center Toree Morris had gotten into

. foul trouble.

Troutman finished the game with
eight points and four rebounds in 19

minutes of play, while Morris and

Lett were ineffective, combining for
one point‘ and one rebound in 18 min-
utes. ,

The Panthers’ offensive attack
was led by Julius Page, who finished

- with 18 points while adding five

boards.
Zavackas added 12 points while

Knight, who played 38 minutes,‘

despite a calf injury, chipped in with
11 points and seven assists. Brown
paced the Panthers with a game-high
seven rebounds. ‘

Pitt shot 45.3 percent for the

game, including 56 percent in the sec- ‘ -

0nd half and managed to keep
Georgetown’s Kevin Braswell, who is
third all-time_ in scoring in the
school’s history, to just eight points.
He finished_three of 13 in field
goal attempts, including two of nine

- from three-point land.’

“Pitt has a very‘ good team and

has a knack for winning games,”
Esherick said. “I really like how
they’re playing together because

‘ they’re effective on both defense and

offense.”

In addition to Sweetney, the only
Georgetown player to score in double
figures was Tony Bethel, who con-
tributed, 14 points, while picking up a
team-high five rebounds.

The win improves Pitt to 16-3
overall and 4-2 in the Big East and
moves the Panthers back ‘into the
rankings as they are No. 25 in the
USA Today/ESPN poll.

“This is certainly not their first
big win of the season,” Esherick said.
“We expected a great game and we
got one.”

Georgetown" drops to 11-6 and 2-
3 in the conference and will be hun-
gry for revenge Saturday afternoon
when the Hoyas take on the Panthers
at Fitzgerald Field House. But first
the Panthers must get by the Syracuse

— Orangemen, who come to town

Tuesday night. .-
As for the win, Howland knows
that his team was fortunate not to lose
after holding such a large lead, and
that Georgetown was able to get back
in the game because he never rested
his starters and they got tired.

“I’m proud that we.kept our com-
posure,” Howland_ said. “We were
lucky to pull it out.” ' I
