Pitt signs deal with Sta

itt computer network
users soon will have
the option of paying a

monthly fee to subscribe to an
Internet service provider (ISP)
for improved remote network
access. .
Provostjames V. Maher told
Senate Councils Monday that a
preferred partnership contract
had been signed this week with
Stargate, a local ISP company.
For a_monthly fee of $16.95
—- more than 20 percent under
the standard customer subscrip-
tion rate’— users can purchase
unlimited PittNet access within
Stargate’s local service region,
which includes ‘western Penn-
sylvania, eastern Ohio and por-

2 itt ofﬁcials voiced dis-
appointment with
Gov. Tom Ridge’s

proposed appropriation to the
University for the ﬁscal year that
begins on_Iuly1,2001— $173.3
million, or $4.1 million less than
Pitt is receiving this year.

But Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg noted that the
governor’s proposal was only the
ﬁrst stage in the budget process.
“Obviously, we will continue to
make our case for higher levels
of support and hope thatboth
the legislature and the adminis-
tration will be receptive, as they
have been in the past,” the chan-
cellor said ina written statement.

Pitt had requested a 5 .8 per-
cent increase in its total appro-
priation for next year, including
$10.5 million in one-time fund'-
ing for biotechnology research,
information technology invest-
ments and laboratory improve-
ments. .

In his Feb. 6 budget message,
Ridge proposed increasing the
University’s base appropriation
but rejected Pitt’s special fund-
ing requests.

.In previous years, such “well-—

_ targeted line-item investments”
have left Pitt and other state-
related universities “better
positioned...to carry out their
many important responsibili-
ties,” Chancellor Nordenberg
said. '

The fact that Ridge’s pro-
posal includes no such funding
for Pitt next year “could -be
viewed as disappointing,” he said.

  a pose; a      
  for Pitt less than current

ber access per month nationally
outside that regi_on (or 800—num-

. ber access in areas where Stargate

lacks local—number access); e-
mail accounts and space for per-
sonal web pages. .

Using authorized passwords
subscribers also will be able to
access Pitt databases that are re-
stricted for security purposes.

International remote access
and high-speed, large bandwidth
digital subscriber line (D SL) ser-
vices will be offered at additional
monthly charges.

“As far as I can tell, there is
not another organization in the
world that has an agreement in

place for such a comprehensive '

set of services,” Maher said. He
described Stargate as “a very re-
sourceful, ﬂexible, entrepreneur-

 

“It is not uncommon, however,
for such support to be added in
later stages of the budget pro-
cess.”

Last February, for example,
the governor proposed funding
just onespecial line item for Pitt:
$3.5 million for academic pro-
gram initiatives. But by the time
Ridge and legislators agreed on
the 2000-2001 state budget,
Pitt’s appropriation included the
$3 .5 million for academic initia-
tives plus another $5.5 million
for lab improvements, informa-
tion technology upgrades and
student life initiatives.

For next year, the governor is
proposing the following fund-

a ing forPitt: 1

° $154.3 million for educa-
tion and general expenses, an
increase of $4.5 million over the
current funding. The University
had requested $157.6 million.

' $8.77 million for Western
Psychiatric Institute and

- Clinic, up by $2 .5 5 million. Pitt

had asked for $8.96 million.

° $7.11 million for medical
programs, up by $2 million.
Pitt’s request: $7.26 million.

° $1.17 million for the den-
tal clinics, a $30,000 increase.
Pitt’s request: $1.2 million.

° $827,000 for rural educa-
tion outreach, down by $96,000.

‘Pitt’s request: $961,000.

° $565,000 for Western
Psych’s teen suicide center, a
$16,000 increase. Pitt’s request:
$578,000.

° $3 66,000 for recruitment

vices we were looking for.
“This adjunct to our already
available network access is part
of a carefully thought’-out strat-
egy to make sure that our tech-

nology resources meet the needs '

of the campus community,” the
provost said. “The Stargate op-
tion will offer guaranteed acces-
sibility at all times for those us-
ers whose educational or research
activities require heavy Internet
usage.” I

The agreement options ex-
tend to Pitt’s four regional cam-
puses. ‘ '

According to Jon Rosenson,
director of strategic initiatives at
Stargate, “The Universityis pay-
ing for two things: discounted
dial-up direct connection to the

. 

virtual private" network (VPN),
customized to Pitt’s needs. The
VPN provides subscribers with
access to PittNet, including re-
stricted databases, from remote
sites.”

‘Under the agreement,
Stargate and Pitt will work to-
gether to implement a private,
high-volume security connection
between the University and the
ISP to determine access eligibil-
ity to the VPN. ‘ _ .

Maher said, “Users will be
able to access Pitt’s resources,
from their Stargate account,'in-

cluding restricted services that

until now could only be accessed
through the University’s modem
pool.” .

Stargate has about 100,000
subscribers, including separate
deals with Duquesne and Indi-
ana University of Pennsylvania,
Rosenson said. “My feeling, and
it’s just a guess, is that we would
have about 2,000 Pitt subscrib-
ers by 'the end of the calendar
year. Many faculty, we know,

deﬁnitely want the faster, more .

. dependable service.”

The‘ digital subscriber line,
which allows users to be on the
Internet and‘ still use the phone
line and operates at much faster
speeds and with greater band-

' width capacity, is a popular op-

tion among Stargate subscrib-
ers, he said. DSL also can sustain
multiply users at one site. It is a
point-to—point service, however,
and cannot be accessed from
other, off—site modems.

The monthly fee for DSL
service is $39.95, which is not
discounted. There also is a start-
up installation fee. ~

Pitt users will subscribe to
the Stargate options on a month

gate as ISP

to month basis, Rosenson said.
The University will be able

to calculate the number of times

Stargate subscribers access the

VPN for PittNet and related ser— ' ii

vices, butnot the number oftimes
users go directly to the Internet,
which is protected under privacy
law, Rosenson said.

The contract went into effect
Feb. '5. “I consider the contract
to be permanent,” Maher said.
“As with any contract, we can
expect to have periodic discus-

» sions of issues as they arise. And

it will take a couple weeks to get
the literature with the options
out in the mail, but we’re talking
weeks not months.”

According to Jinx Walton,
director of Computing Services
and Systems Development
(CSSD), the University is subsi-

 
Stargate,- but slieideclined to say ‘

how much Pitt is paying. Pitt is

not required to supply a mini-'

ment of Ethics. will be the
keynote speaker at this

Number of applicants

henumberofstudents
who have applied to
be freshmen at the

Pittsburgh campus in fall 2001
already has exceeded the total
who applied for last fall.

And compared with the ap-
plicants to whom Pitt had of-
fered admission at this time last
year, slightly more of this year’s

-accepted applicants graduated in

the top 10 percent of their high
school classes. 1

“The other big news ‘is that
the pool of African-American
freshman applicants is 40 per-
cent higher than at this time last
year, and more of these students
meet the University’ s admission
standards,” said Betsy A. Porter,
director of Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid.

As ofFeb. 1, 13,750 students
had applied to be Pittsburgh
campus freshmen next fall.
That’s 15.5 percent more than
the number who had applied last
year at this time, and more than
the total 13,565 who applied
during all of last year.

(Under the University’s “roll-
ing admissions” policy, Pitt
doesn’t set an ofﬁcial deadline
for applications but continues to
accept them as long as slots re-

continues to increase

main for qualiﬁed students.)

“As of right now, it’s impos-
sible to say with absolute cer-
tainty what next fall’s freshman
class will look like in terms of
academic credentials,” Porter
said. “But it’s looking very, very
positive.”

Among the 8,252 freshman
applicants to whom Pitt had of-
fered admission as of last week,
39 percent (3,218) graduated in
the top 10 percent of their high
school classes. That’s compared
with 3 7 percent of7, 193 accepted
applicants at this point last year.

Among the approximately
3,000 freshmen who actually
enrolled at the Pittsburgh cam-
pus last fall, more than 1,000
graduated in the top 10 percent
of their high school classes. In
fall 1995 , only 460 Pitt freshmen
held that distinction.

As of last week, the Univer-
sity had received 1,804 freshman
applications from African-
Americans, compared with 1,2 94
at this point last year.

Pitt offered admission to 993
African-American freshmen last
year. As of last week, the Univer-
sity already had offered admis-
sion to 911 Afr_ican—Americans.

Chancellor's
staff award:
What's the
official name?

To the editor:

For the second year in a row,
the University Times has gotten
the name of the chancellor’s
award for staff wrong, in its ar-
ticle concerning the announce-
ment of winners. According to a
University web site which was
on-line in December, the title of
this award is:

Chancellor’s Distinguished
Service Award for Excellence for
Staff Employees.

The Times each year has left
out the words “Distinguished
Service.” '

VVhy do I care? In past years
our department tried several
times to nominate people for
what we thought was a staff award
where excellence in job perfor-
mance at the University would
be the main criterion. We be-
lieved that this wasimplied by
the original title, which was
“Chancellor’s Award for Excel-
lence for Staff Employees,” with
no mention of service. It subse-
quently became clear that how-
ever well a staff member did his
or her job, there was no chance
of winning an award without a
signiﬁcant amount of public ser-
vice outside of the University.

I wrote to the University
Times about this and, subse-
quently in the fall of 1 999, I sent
an e—mail and wrote a letter to
the chancellor, pointing out that
the name of the award was mis—
leading and led to fruitless ef-
forts by faculty to secure this
award for valued staff members.
It also falsely raised the hope of
the staff nominees that they
might have a chance for such an

at Pitt, in parallel with similar
faculty awards for teaching and
research. .

I was never favored with the
courtesy of a reply, but mysteri-
ously, when the award was an-
nounced in 1999, the word Ser-
vice became part of the title, a
subtlety which the University
Times ignores each year. VVhile
I believe that excellence on the
job here at Pitt has been an im-
portant factor in the award, the
new title accurately reﬂects the

     

signiﬁcant role also played by
outside service.

I hope that when next year’s
winners are announced the award
is given its proper title by the
University Times.

Uninspired by pay of
top Pitt administrators

To the editor:

V5/hen I read about the large
percentage raises our top admin-
istrators are getting and their
over-impressive salaries (1/11/
01), I am not inspired. So bo-
nuses are out, but instead 22.6
percent raises (for the chancel-
lor, last year’s bonus “folded into
their base salaries”), 13.2 per-
cent for the controller, and a
small raise to bring the Health
Sciences senior vice chancellor
to a mere $537,000.

Compare these superstars
with faculty and ordinary staff
“raises” — often not even com-
pensation for inﬂation or in-
creased medical insurance co-
payments. Why is it that the
higher-ups need the incentives
of CEO—type salaries and raises?
Mainline teaching and research

are grunt work!

There is something gross
about these half—million and
quarter—million salaries, along
with the claim that in order to
get good leadership we must be
competitive. This is a university,
despite abolishing most of the
dean titles for vice presidentof
this and that. True, our top ad-
ministrators are in line with
American CEO-style pay, now
many more multiples ahead of
their average workers’ pay than
it once was. The average worker
in America is stuck, like the fac-
ulty and staff here, watching the
ascending star of the rewards for
the luminaries.

lVlI.A proposal on faculty

To the editor:

As tenured faculty members
in the Department of English,
we would like to respond to your
recent front—page article entitled
“MLA recommendation on fac-
ulty termed unrealistic” (1/25/
01). We are disturbed by the
imbalance in this article’s repre-
sentation of a problematic de-
velopment both at Pitt and at
research universities across the
country — namely, the unprec-
edented growth of part-time and
non—tenure—stream faculty as a
percentage of “those teaching
courses in the undergraduate
curriculum. We feel that the ar-
ticle (and all but one of the ad-
ministrators quoted) was dismiss-
ive of an important attempt by
the Modern Language Associa-
tion (MLA) to raise professional
and public awareness of highly
questionable stafﬁng practices
that have become standard in
universities like ours.

The article repeatedly con-
demns as “unrealistic” the MLA
recommendation that language
departments staff at least‘ half of
their credits with tenured or ten-
ure-track professors. Given the
national averages the MLA found
in its valuable and extensive sur-
vey (which states that only 30.7
percent of undergraduate course
sections in doctoral-granting En-
glish departments and only 25.7
percent in doctoral- granting for-
eign language departments are
taught by tenured or tenure-
stream faculty), 5 0 percent would
clearly require a profound shift
in attitudes and resources. The

question, however, ‘is not

whether 50 percent should be p

the precise goal but whether it is
satisfactory-—- to administrators,
faculty, students, parents, state
legislators, and the tax-paying
public — that English and for-
eign language departments at re-
search universities staff less than
one—third of their undergradu-
ate courses with tenured or ten-
ure—stream faculty.

University and department.
administrators quoted in the ar-
ticle criticize the MLA recom-
mendation for focusing on cred-
its rather than courses. This sort
of hair-splitting overlooks the
fact that, despite the language of
the resolution, the MLA survey
did focus on courses —— and ar-
rived at the startling ﬁgures re-
ported above. The MLA survey
also distinguishes between dif-

ferent institutions (public or pri- _

vate), different departments
(doctorate, master’s, bachelor’s,
or associate’s), and different
courses (ﬁrst—year writing or lan-
guage courses as opposed to
other undergraduate courses).
The survey found, for instance,
that in doctoral-granting English
departments, ‘though 47 percent

of all courses offered are courses 4

in ﬁrst-year writing, tenured or
tenure—stream faculty teach only
6 percent of these courses. This
ﬁgure gives some indication of

the extent to which tenured or

tenure—stream faculty in research
universities have fled certain
parts of the introductory cur-
riculum. .
Finally, University and de-

partment administrators quoted
in the article suggest that the
quality of teaching in research
universities is not at all compro-
mised by the use of non—tenure-
stream faculty. We agree that
there are many non—tenure-
stream faculty who are marvel-
ous teachers and who make a
valuable contribution to higher
education. But to end all discus-
sion here would be to overlook
the undeniable fact that most
non—tenure—stream faculty are
overworked and underpaid. Sto-
ries abound of poorly compen-

sated faculty who teach courses .

at several universities during the
same semester in order to make
ends meet. To presumethat such
practices have no effect on the
quality of teaching (especially
over the long haul) is to presume
that working conditions have no

effect on the worker. Moreover, _

even those non—tenure—stream
faculty not forced to work at
multiple institutions are often
excluded from crucial decision-
making about policy and cur-
riculum in their departments —
or, if they do participate, they

\.

receive little credit for doing so.

The MLA survey reveals that
compensation for non—tenure-
stream faculty (both part-time
and full—time) in the English de-
partment at Pitt is considerably
below the average for doctoral-
granting English departments at
similar public research universi-
ties. Such matters merit serious
action. There are, we believe,
ﬁscally responsible initiatives
that would improve both the
working conditions of part-time
and non-tenure-stream faculty
and the pedagogical climate of
undergraduate education. These
could include increased pay,
greater support for professional
development_, and wider eligi-
bility for University recognition

’ of and rewards fortheir work.

The quality of undergraduate
education, the working condi-
tions of a large percentage of
faculty, and the future of aca-
demic freedom are all at stake.

For quite some time, the University has had a
policy that provides incentive payments to princi-
pal investigators (PIs) of funded research grants,
of an amount equal to a percentage of the grant’s
indirect costs. Such payments have been used by

— PIS for equipment, supplies, travel and other re-
search—related expenses. According to the pro-
vost, in 1985 School of Medicine PIS were permit-
ted to use their incentive payments to supplement

 

' incentive plan. or plans that permit use of the payments to
supplement compensation.)

Last fall the medical school’s RIPC were reviewed, culminat-
ing in the issuance of a document by Dean Arthur S. Levine
entitled, “Research Incentive Plan,” to be effective July 1, 2001.
Applicable to faculty with primary appointments in the medical
school, it replaces the existing departmental plans.

A question was raised about the extent to which Dr. Levine
consulted with medical school leaders and faculty. He stated at

' the Dec. 4 Senate Council meeting that the new plan was
discussed at a medical faculty meeting. Because only 37 of the
1,800-plus medical school faculty members were present, Dr.
Levine said, he did not feel it was useful to put the proposal to a
vote.

VVhile the medical school’s new RIPC was being developed,
interest was expressed in establishing an RIPC at the Graduate
School of Public Health. Apparently, examination of this subject
was -prompted, at least in part, by GSPH Interim Dean Herbert
Rosenkranz. An RIPC was ﬁrst considered at GSPH by the
school’s planning and budget policies committee, and subse-
quently by the GSPH Council, the governance body of the
GSPH, which includes elected faculty. The council decided to
obtain faculty views on the subject, and a faculty meeting was

ject. ,

More than half of the GSPH faculty attended the meeting. I
was present and can report that there were many excellent
contributions to the discussion. The discussion encompassed
consideration of values; the appropriateness of personal ﬁnancial
incentives for research without corresponding incentives for
other faculty activity; the need for ﬁnancial incentives to allow
the school to remain competitive with other schools of public
health and other institutions, including medical schools, that
seek faculty with talent in the same areas as GSPH faculty; the
possibility an RIPC would further de-emphasize instruction and
discourage research collaboration, and whether an RIPC would
lead PIs to select research topics and funding sources based on
RIPC payment opportunities, in preference to other types of
funding sources with lower prospects for such payments. The
result of that meeting was a decision to place the RIPC proposal
on a printed ballot for a vote by the entire GSPH faculty. Also put
to a vote was whether to cap supplemental compensation at
$20,000 per year; the medical school cap is $100,000 per year.

Well over half the GSPH faculty returned ballots. Faculty
voted 56-35 in favor of establishing an RIPC, and endorsed the
$20,000 cap by a vote of 47-38. Interim Dean Rosenkranz
forwarded_the faculty’s recommendation to Dr. Levine, who is
also senior vice chancellor for Health Sciences.

Faculty Assembly unveils system  
for evaluating dept. chairpersons

survey for faculty
evaluations of de-
partment chairper-

sons was unveiled by a Univer-
sity Senate task force at the Jan.
30 Faculty Assembly meeting.
Assembly members praised
the survey, but concerns about
how it will be administered pre-
vented the group from recom-

mending that the evaluations be '

done University—wide.

The two-page survey forms
—— tested last fall in a pilot project
in the schools of education, in-
formation sciences and public
health —— ask faculty to rate their
bosses’ leadership and commu-
nications skills, abilities as ad-
ministrators and mentors, and
contributions to accomplishing
departmental goals.

Among the 227 faculty mem-
bers in the three schools, 43 per-
cent completed and returned sur-
veys, which solicited comments
on the survey process itself in
addition to opinions of chairper-

sons’ job performances. Among .

respondents, 68 percent recom-
mended that the evaluations be
conducted annually.

“Our emphasis is on devel-
oping constructive comments
from the faculty in each of the

departments, which would then V

ment chair and to the deans for

use in the chair’s annual evalua- V

tion,” said Senate Vice Presi-
dent Carol K. Redmond, who
chaired the task force that devel-
oped the survey. ,

She said the surveys would be
analogous to student evaluations
of faculty teaching: They would
be a contributing factor, but
hardly the sole or decisive one,
in a chairperson’s performance
evaluation.

And, evaluators would remain
anonymous. Only a summary of
the survey results would be re-

leased to the dean and depart-
ment chair, not the forms them-

selves. "
Redmond wouldn’t- reveal
what faculty in education, infor-
mation sciences and public health
had to say about their depart-
ment chairs, but she said the Sen-
ate is forwarding summaries to
the schools’ chairpersons and
cleans. . . ~
At Faculty»Assembly, profes-
sors praised the survey, Redmond
and her task force. But some
questioned how the surveys
would work in schools such as

demic departments. Other fac-

Note the considerable difference between the medical school’s
process and the process at GSPH. The medical school meeting drew
only 3 7 faculty members. The agenda for the medical school faculty
meeting included nine items, one of which consisted of four com-
mittee reports. The third of these reports was entitled, “Update on-
Compensation Rationale: Dr. Levine,” and meeting minutes indi-
cate that RIPC was the subject under that heading. Often, people
decide whether to attend a meeting based on the meeting’s subject,
and whether they will have any role in a decision. The agenda of the
medical school meeting provided no clear indication that Dr. Levine
would put forward his plan to replace the departmental RIPC with
a single, school—wide RIPC. t ._ .

One might account for the difference between the processes at-

the two schools by the fact that Dr. Levine had no prior academic
experience, let alone academic leadership experience, before assum-
ing his administrative positions here. After completing his graduate
medical training, Dr. Levine spent his entire career at the National
Institutes of Health as a researcher and functionary.

In contrast, GSPH’s interim dean had served as ,a department
chairperson here, and had held‘ academic appointments elsewhere.
Encouraging faculty to participate in discussions of issues that may

_ have substantial impact on them, with a focused meeting followed by
_ a faculty vote, is consistent with the culture of an academic institu-

tion. No similar process was evident at the medical school regarding
Dr. Levine’s proposal. (For what it is worth, I agree with Dr.
Levine’s decision to have a single RIPC. The argument that each
department may have to address its speciﬁc needs, and thus should
have its own, tailored RIPC, is not very persuasive.)

One other RIPC—related matter is whether RIPC raises issues
about University values and processes, on which the views of faculty
in schools that do not have RIPC should be taken into account. For
faculty in many schools here, there are no funding sources, such as
the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Founda-
tion, that pay full indirect costs. Thus, as a practical matter, the
opportunity to receive such supplemental compensation does not
exist for many faculty who have well—supported research programs.
Is a process that provides the opportunity for supplemental compen-
sation for some faculty of the University appropriate, when such
rewards are not available to others with similar research production?

The process followed at GSPH, with active faculty participation,
provided a way to give the RIPC issue a thorough airing. I doubt that

many faculty believe a dean or other academic administrator should v

necessarily feel bound by a majority vote of faculty on an issue. But
by allowing, if not fostering, debate on an issue, a greater under-
standing of the pros and cons of a course of action can be achieved,

to be better, and the decision more likely to be accepted by those

Nursing dean needs fundraising

credentials, Search committee told

he School of Nursing
is better than 70 per-
cent of the way toward

meeting its $3.1 million goal in
the University’s capital cam-
paign, Pitt trustee Roger Glunt
reported ataFeb. 1.hearingspon-
sored by the committee search-
ing for a new nursing dean.

- .To continue progress made
under outgoing Dean Ellen
Rudy, the'school’s next dean like-
wise should have strong creden-
tials in fundraising and alumni
relations, said Glunt, who serves
on the nursingschool Board of
Visitors and chairs the school’s
capital campaign committee.

“Our school has made a lot of

‘progress in recent years in culti-

vating alumni to support the
school in many ways, including
time, talent and treasure,” Glunt
said. “I strongly urge you to look
at dean candidates who under-
stand the importance of devel-
opment and alumni relations.”
Search committee chairper-
son Patricia D‘. Kroboth said a
number of other people have
echoed Glunt’s advice — in ad-
dition to saying the new dean
should demonstrate strong re-
search and teaching credentials,
leadership sldlls, sensitivity to
community health needs, and a
commitment to strengthening

'the school’s links with non-de-

gree granting nursing schools in
western Pennsylvania.

The search committee has
received more than 40 nomina-
tions so far, including some in-
house- and/or minority candi-
dates, according to Kroboth.

“We hope‘ to begin face—to-
face interviews with candidates
by mid-March,” said Kroboth,
who is professor and chairper-
son of the School of Pharmacy’s

pharmaceutical sciences depart— .

ment.

The committee plans to rec-
ommend ﬁnalists by mid-May
to Arthur S. Levine, senior vice
chancellor for the Health Sci-
ences. Levine wants to have the
new nursing_ dean in place by

July 1.

, “It’s a tight time frame, but
we’re optimistic about meeting
the deadline,” Kroboth said.

‘ She urged faculty, students,

‘ staff and alumni to nominate

dean candidates in writing (send
letters to Kroboth at 903 Salk
Hall, Pittsburgh 15261) or via e-
mail (krobothp@msx.upmc.edu).
,During -.the,. Fe_b.. .1 Search
committee hearing, Nathan
Hershey, a Graduate School of
Public Health professor and
president of Pitt’s University
Senate, nominated Jacqueline
Dunbar-Iacob, chairperson of
nursing’s Department of Health
and Community Systems.
Hershey served with Dunbar-
Jacob on the search committee
for Pitt’s senior vice chancellor

for Health Sciences. “I was very
impressed,” Hershey said. “She
probably talked less than anyone
else on the committee but made
more valuable contributions to
the discussion.”

Susan Ahlbrecht, an associ-

ate professor in health and com-
munity- systems, -seconded
Hershey’s assessment, praising
Dunbar-]acob’s ‘leadership and
creativity. “She’s done a fantas-
tic job as chairperson. She’d be
an excellent dean,” Ahlbrecht
said.

Ellen Rudy, dean since 1991,

_ will resign at the end of the cur-

rent academic year. She plans to
move to Columbus, Ohio, to be
closer to family members.

Lothrop water supply poses no
threat, county health dept. says

othrop Hall’s water 1
supply poses no health
threat, according to re-

cently completed testing by the
county health department.

The health department had
conducted tests for the Legion-
ella bacterium after a Pitt custo-
dial employee assigned- to

, Lothrop Hall was diagnosed with

Legionnaire’s Disease.

, Legionnaire’s Disease is a
pneumonia-like illness caused by
"Legionella, a non-contagious
common bacterium. Typically,
the disease is contracted by in-
haling the Legionella bacteria in
contaminated water droplets or
mists or sprays in the air. Vic-
tims usually are adults over 50,
especially smokers, and people
with weakened immune systems.

According to Guillermo Cole
of the Allegheny County Health
Department, the water supply
testing determined there was no
health risk to Lothrop Hall resi-
dents. _

“Only two of the seven
samples taken of the water sup-
ply showed even low concentra-
tions of the Legionella bacte-

ria,” Cole said.

Cole added that the victim
could have contracted the dis-
ease just about anywhere. The
60—year-old victim, whose name
has not been released, remains
hospitalized, but his condition

has been upgraded to good.

According to a statement is-
sued by‘ Pitt’s Ofﬁce of News
and Information, the results of
the health department tests “con—
ﬁrm the fact that _there is no
health risk for the students liv-
ing in the building, and that there
is no requirement for any action
on the part of the University.”
’ Although not required to do
so, Pitt will take the added pre-
caution of ﬂushing out the water

- system in the dormitory. The

-procedure involves heating the
water to 158 degrees and ﬂush-
ing the system at that tempera-
ture for 20 minutes. ‘

“This is one of the processes ’

that kills the Legionella bacte-
ria,” Cole said. '

Pitt plans to do the disinfec-
tion process during the week of
spring break (March 5-9).

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Future of Senate Council to be ‘

considered by faculty committee

hould Senate Council
be restructured, or
even scrapped?

University Senate President
Nathan Hershey has asked the
Senate’s bylaws and procedures
committee to study the issue.

Hershey told EacultyAssem—
bly onJan. 30 that he has sensed
“a fair amount of dissatisfaction,”
particularly among faculty, with
the current Senate Council for-
mat.

Many Council meetings con-
sist of unrelated reports by fac-
ulty, staff, students and adminis-
trators that don’t call for discus-
sion and eat up time that would
be better used for debating cam-
pus issues, said Hershey, para-
phrasing faculty complaints.

Pitt’s University Senate in—
cludes two representative bod-
ies: Faculty Assembly (which, as
its name implies, is limited to
faculty elected from each Pitt
school) and Senate Council
(composed of faculty who have
served for one year on Faculty
Assembly, plus representatives
of Pitt’s senior administration,
the Staff Association Council and
several student governance

' groups). «

Faculty Assembly tends to act
as a lower house, debating reso-
lutions before passing them along

to Senate Council — although
the Assembly sometimes issues
its own statements and endorse-
ments, especially when it wants
to publicly protest or praise ad-
ministrative actions. A
Neither Faculty Assembly
nor Senate Council has the power
to set University policy. But
Council approval carries more
weight because the group in—
cludes Pitt’s chancellor and other

administrative decision-makers.’

One downside of having the
chancellor and his appointees on
the Council is that they vote as a
block, Hershey said. “If the chan-
cellor makes clear his position,
can [other administrators on
Council] reallyvote differently?”
Hershey asked.

,He cited Council votes on
resolutions urging that Pitt con-
sider extending health beneﬁts
to same-sex partners of faculty
and staff. Administrators on
Council voted unanimously
against the resolutions, after
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
stated that Pitt would not con-
sider extending the beneﬁts as
long as the University is defend-
ing itself against a lawsuit seek-
ing to force the issue.

“I havﬁe the impression,”
Hershey said, “that students and
the staff have‘ various direct

routes to the chancellor, but we
as faculty don’t have any route to
the chancellor except through

recommendations that ﬁrst go _
’ through the Faculty Assembly

and then on to the Senate Coun-
cil, where students, staff and ad-
ministrators join in the voting.
'“I wonder whether it might
be appropriate,” Hershey con-

tinued, “to consider just having a_

Faculty Senate and doing away
with the Senate Council.”

By a show of hands, Faculty’

Assembly supported Hershey’s
idea of letting the bylaws and
procedures committee examine
the Senate Council question and

‘bring suggestions to a future

Assembly meeting.

;But while they agreed that
Council’s meetings can‘ be bor-
ing and its agendas unwieldy,
Assembly members didn’t favor
eliminating the group.

For one thing, they said,
Council meetings provide a rare
opportunity for faculty, staff and
students to publicly question

Pitt’s chancellor, rovost, senior ,
P

vice chancellor for Health Sci-
ences and other administrators.

“I don’t think that [public
forum] is necessarily well-used,
but I think we should not lose
that aspect,” said law professor
Alan tMeisel.

tative for the Pitt account, was
invited to the Senate beneﬁts
and welfare committee meeting

that the health plan was derelict

correct billing errors in a timely

‘ manner. Hershey has weighed

in on the issue at recent Senate
Council and Faculty Assembly
meetings, as well as in other fo-
rums, including the University
Times (see Jan. 11 issue).

At;theJan. 30 FacultyAss_em-
bly, the Senate president said
that explanation of benefits
(EOB) forms frequently contain
errors that apply charges to mem-
bers that should be picked up by
the health plan. He also said some
double—billing instances have
been reported, where members
are improperly charged a co-pay-
ment twice.

Williams acknowledged that
there have been billing prob-
lems. He also acknowledged that

he did not know how widespread.

they are. But he insisted that the
health plan was actingin good

- faith and was taking proactive

steps to alleviate the problems,
both on the individual and sys-
temic levels. - 6

Also attending the beneﬁts
and welfare committee meeting
was James Edgerton, Human
Resources assistant vice chan-
cellor for Compensation and
Beneﬁts.‘ Hershey and others
have charged Human Resources
with not being aggressive enough
in following up employees’ com-
plaints, a charge ' Human Re-
sources denied.

Hershey’ did not attend the
beneﬁts and welfare committee
meeting. '

Pitt entered into a three—year,

sole—provider contract with the
health plan lastJuly 1. There are

about 12,000 Pitt employees and
dependents covered under three
UPMC Health Plan options —
comprehensive (deductible),
point-of-service (POS) and en-
hanced HMO. .

“I did want to address a couple

things brought up recently by ‘

Professor Hershey,” Williams
told the beneﬁts and welfare

committee. “But ﬁrst I want to-

say,-we are absolutely commit-

ted to providing quality customer ’ I
— service to Pitt faculty and staff.”

As evidence of that commit-
ment, Williams. said the health
plan has" a dedicated services
hotline number (I-888-499-
6885) and sends a customer ser-
vice representative to campus the
third Thursday and Friday of
each month to meet by appoint-
ment with employees who have
problems or questions.

“We want members to un-

derstand, we have dedicated reps:

to serve them speciﬁcally,” Wil-
liams said. “There are only two
accounts we do that for and we
can track more speciﬁcally those

issues an individual has. Calling _

the hotline numberis better for

us, it’s easier for us if they come A

there ﬁrst, and we believe it’s
better for the members. So we

publish the hotline number in '

every way possible.”
Williams said thehealth plan
will begin publishing a -newslet-

, ter this spring geared to the Pitt

market. ,

Senate bylaws don’t mandate
the current Senate Council for-
mat, noted psychology profes-
sor James Holland. Jerome
Wells, of economics, suggested
focusing meeting agendas on
speciﬁc issues rather than a suc-
cession of reports.

Chancellor Nordenberg, in-
terviewed after Monday’s Sen-
ate Council meeting, called the
Council “a good forum in the
sense that it brings students, fac-

, ulty, staff and administrators to-

gether. It gives us a chance to
swap. information and get to
know each other better. And I
think, particularly in the last year
or so, we have dealt construc-
-tively with some issues that are

important to the faculty com-

munity atlarge” — for example,
upgrading Pitt computer sys-
tems. ‘

t“We had’ pretty free-ranging
discussions of that topic during
several Council meetings in the
fall, and today we had students,
staff and faculty indicating that
there‘ had been a response to
their expressions of _concern,”
Nordenbergisaid. “I’m sure that
the plans that were put in place

really did beneﬁt from those dis— 1

cussions.”

See computer story on page 1.

Rich Colwell, president of
Pitt’s Staff Association.Council,
said he values the “open forum
quality” of Senate Council-

“It would be a great loss for
staff if Senate Council were
eliminated, although our group
doesn’t like to bring up our dirty
laundry at Council meetings,”
Colwell said. “We generally
don’t bring issues to Senate
Council except as a lastresort,
when we can’t resolve them be-

within a decade or two, librar-
ians and scholars warn. '
In the meantime, published

information in the sciences is .
increasing by 13. percent annu-

ally (7,000 new scientiﬁc journal
articles are published daily),
squeezing «humanities journals
out of library collections.

And, new copyright "laws and\

reinterpretations of old ones are

tual‘ property rights of universi-
ties and individual scholars.

A new, provost-appointed
committee will examine how Pitt
can ﬁght these and other threats
to scholarly publishing, and how
faculty can work through their
professional organizations to
tackle the problems at the -na-
tional level.

Chairing the committee will
be Rush Miller, Hillman Uni-

ocal regulations gov-i

erning street vendors,

including the popular

mobile eateries dotting the Pitts-

burgh campus, will change un-

der a new city ordinance expected
to be ﬁnalized next week.

The ordinance will require

’ street vendors to obtain a vend-

ing license, renewable annually;
to prove that they have paid taxes;
to abide by relevant health codes;
to comply with restrictions on
vending cart size; to buy insur-
ance against property and per-
sonal liability; and to comply with

“noise, odor, signage and hours

of operation restrictions, among
other re - lations.

 

 
  

Inittee, a group of seven ofﬁcials

The biggest change, and the

one with the most repercussions

I for the Pittsburgh campus, is that

the city is restricting vendors to
designated areas, which will dis-
place vendors accustomed to
vending at metered parking
spaces, such as in front of
Hillman Library.

City Ordinance N o. 2 6, basi-
cally a re—writing of the city’s
business licensing code, passed
City Council in December and
then re-passed over Mayor Tom

Subscribers will need _a dial-

Walton said modems can be pur-
chased through..Pitt’s e—store for
$5 0-$ 1 00. '

Pitt users still have remote

access available through the-

University’s 800-modem pool.
Walton said that the pro-

’ tracted negotiations to reach an

agreement with an ISP worked
to the University’s advantage.
“The original offer did not in-
clude the DSL option, and ac-
cess time was going to be limited

to 100 hours a month for every— 5

body.” I V

She said that contractually
Stargate is committed to 99.9
percent access without busy.sig-
nals, and the ISP must increase
its number of maintained mo-
dems and bandwidth capacityto
ensure that success rate. “We
also will be able to _verify the

— PittNet connectivity success rate

here under the contract terms.

We’re not going to just take their‘

word for it,” she said.

Susan Sereika, co-chair of the
Senate’s computer usage com-
mittee, said she was very happy

that an agreement has been

reached. “Our committee» is

thrilled. While we didn’t really
have much input into the nego-
tiations, we were asked very early
on to suggest what users in -the
University community’s needs
were, and I think this deal covers
most or all our suggestions. I do

have some concerns for some of
our students on the branch cam-
puses, if they are out of the local

‘ [access] area, but with 15 0 hours
_ [a month] of access, and with the

ability to continue to use the 800
modem ‘pool already there, I
think they’ll be okay.” .
Michael Spring, associate
professor of information science
and telecommunications, said
that the virtual private network
agreement was critical. “The
VPN is wonderful to have nego-

tiated. Virtually extending the’

Pitt modem pool through
Stargate will help with routing
mail through the system, access-
ing the library database, extend-
ing on-line registration services
and Courselnfo and other ser-
vices. There had to be a lot of
technical negotiations to make
that work.” j

' Spring. questioned whether
Stargate will be able to maintain
connectivitysuccessduringpeak
hours and avoid the delays that
have plagued Pitt in the recent

V past. “Also,modem connectivity _

is one thing. But will there be
delays when the Internet is
heavily congested? You can have
the connection, but not the
through—put.”

Cl
In related computer updates,
Maher reported to Senate Coun-
cil that:

' Since December, Pitt had?

increased its network bandwidth
capacity by a factor of 2.5. “We

had 50 megabytes per second ‘of
available capacity, we now have

.125. We are monitoring usage

closely, but at the moment we’re
not experiencing any of the
blockages that were occurring in

the fall.” ‘ e   1

° Courselnfo, which Mahe
acknowledged had signiﬁcant
problems throughout the fall, has
been improved, the provost said.
Courselnfo is an integrated soft-
ware package that allows faculty
to use web pages for instruction.

“We discovered 'we’re the
world’s biggest user of

CourseInfo and the program is.

not as scalable as the designer
had thought it would be,” Maher
said. '

“As a result, the company has
brought out an expanded ver-
sion, Blackboard 5 , which should
be much more scalable.”

Maher said the

Dew

Courselnfo program currently"

is being tested and would be in-
stalled and ready for use by fall
term 2001. ; ’ ,
Additionally, Pitt made a
number of changes to the
Courselnfo System’s conﬁgura-

- tion. There were increases in

server capacity and the number
of potential concurrent users and
an upgrade of database indexes,
Maher said. “There have been
no failures in the system since
these changes were madein De-
cember.”

1 from vending at metered park-

ing spaces.

That controversial provision I
was amended by City Council‘

last week to allow vendors to
park vehicles at metered spaces,
subject to normal parking re-
strictions, as long as they do not
sell directly from the vehicle.
So a vendor like long-time
Pitt Stop owner Charles
Bonasorte can park his trucks at

metered spots, unload his wares V
and then sell them as a stationary .

vendor at his familiar spot at
Forbes and Bigelow, which is a
city-approved vending site.

Bonasorte had threatened to
sue the city over the ordinance
until‘ the latest amendment was
approved. —

“If a UPS truck pulls up at a
meter and the guy gets out and

delivers a package, what’s the '

‘difference from me parking my
truck in front of the Cathedral

A and setting up [across the street]

to sell my goods?” Bonasorte
said..“We thought theordinance
as it was written before was un-
constitutional. I do believe that
the city can regulate what is sold
at a metered spot, and can say if

you’re a vendor, you have to have '
» a license and you have to have

insurance, and all that. And I
think the ultimate effect will be
to limitisome of the trash on the
sidewalks and protect against
vendors who operate without a
license.’’ .

Bonasorte also said the ordi-
nance will guard against vendors
who block Wheelchair ramps or
park at designated handicapped
parking spots or otherwise in-
terfere with pedestrian and ve-

. hicular trafﬁc. .

Pitt’s Community and Govern-
mental Relations ofﬁce, the Uni-
versity has supported the ordi-
vnancein part to alleviate trafﬁc

around Hillman Library and in
' part because the ordinance calls
for strict enforcement of license

and health codes. _

“Despite some recent pub-
lished reports, the University is
not againstvendors,” Roling said.
“They add diversity to the cul-
ture in our urban environment.
They provide tasty foods. They
provide a service to the Univer-
sity community.”

. In fact, Roling said, Pitt hopes
towork with the city to have a
few designated vending cart sites
on campus, such as in the area of
the Posvar Hall/Hillman» Li-
brary/ Law Building plaza.

“VVhat we oppose is the cur-
rent situation, where vendors are

causing gridlock, especially

around Hillman Library, and
where there is no hygiene con-
trol, which might pose a health
threat to our community. Now
vendors will have to display li-
censes and their health—depart—
ment approvals and that can help
customers make their decisions.”

Roling cautioned, however,
that the ordinance will have re-
percussions for anyone who parks
at city meters in the Oakland
area. “There will be no more
running out and feeding the
meter each time the time ex-
pires, without risking a ticket.
The law says you have to move
your car after one [meter cycle].
Actually, that’s always been the
law, but it hasn’t been enforced.
The Parking Authority has
warned us that this will be strictly
enforced.” I ’

Roling said the Parking Au-
thority also is recommending
that the meters in front of
Hillman Library be converted
from a two-hour time limit to 30
minutes.

Sites in Oakland that have
been approved by the vendor
site ‘designation committee in-
clude: two sites at the corner of
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Bou-
levard (William Pitt Union side);
two on Bigelow Boulevard be-
tween Fifth and Forbes avenues;
two at Fifth Avenue and DeSoto

I Street (public health school side);

two at the corner of O’Hara and
DeSoto streets (north and south
ends); two at the corner of Fifth
Avenue and Craig Street (PNC
bank side); two at Forbes Av-
enue and Bigelow Boulevard
(Schenley Parking plaza side-
walk/greenspace area), and six
or seven in the Schenley Park
plaza parking lot, to be leased
from the city Parking Author-

tyAn additional four Oakland
sites are approved on the
Carnegie Mellon campus on
Tech Street near the Margaret
Morrison Building.

There are 17 approved sites
in the Downtown area; one on
West Ohio Street; one at Cedar
Avenue and E. North Avenue;
one at the Eliza Furnance trail
entrance; one at 4503 Penn Ave.

nated sites near all city swim-

UNIVERSITY TIMES

New study- abroad program to
match faculty, Honors College

undergrads for ﬁeld research

novel new Pitt study-

abroad program will

match faculty with
teams of University Honors Col-
lege undergraduates, to collabo-
rate on ﬁeld research in foreign
countries.

The Research Abroad Pro-
gram (RAP) will award each par-
ticipating student a $3,000 sti-
pend, and each participating fac-
ulty member the same stipend
plus an expense allowance based
on the U.S. State Department
per diem rate for the city or area
where the research is conducted.

RAP will be Pitt’s ﬁrst fac-
ulty—led, team-oriented “re—
search abroad” program for un-
dergraduates, said William
Brustein, who became director
of the University Center for In-
ternational Studies (UCIS) last
month.

Brustein developed RAP with
help from Honors College Dean
Alec Stewart and Annagene
Yucas, director of Pitt’s Study
Abroad ofﬁce. “VVhat we have_in
mind,” Brustein said, “is to en-
courage faculty members to re-

cruit a small team of honors stu- ,

dents and take them abroad for
4-_8 weeks to work on a research
project, probably one that the
faculty member already has in
mind.”

Ideally, he said, these faculty-
student collaborations would
continue after participants re-
turn to the United States.
Undergrads would help analyze
data gathered during ﬁeldwork,
and would be encouraged to con-
vert their own research ﬁndings
into senior papers and published
works. '

lems. “We have a team, involv-
ing all the functional areas, from
member services to our claims

- shop to claims referral [person-

nel], that review open issues’
brought by members of the Uni-
versity in order to reach closure
on speciﬁc issues. At the same
time this team is looking for any
trends that may be there. They,
ﬁle reports, which are reviewed

weekly by a senior management _

team to see if those’ trends are
being identiﬁed.”

If a particular health care pro-
vider, for example, has been the
focus of recurring billing com-
plaints, the health plan will send
advisers to the provider to help
iron out the complaints and look
into the information systems that
may be at their source.

“And while we’re‘ not out

there doing their billing or send— _

ing out information for them,
we do educate them _on the
proper policies and procedures
to follow,” he said. «
According to Williams, the
most common billing problem is
with point of service customers.
“Customers who do not prop-
erly .coordinate their care
through theirdesignated primary

RAP is scheduled to begin
this summer with a pilot pro-
gram involving a maximum of
two faculty members and six
Honors College students. Infor-
mation on RAP will be mailed to
faculty next week. March 15 is
the deadline for applying for this
summer’s pilot program.

Brustein said the pilot pro-
gram “would be ideal for a fac-
ulty member who’s thinking, ‘My
God, I’m not on the payroll this
summer. I have this great project
I’ve been thinking of, I’m going
to be in the ﬁeld anyway, and
here’s an opportunity not only
to help fund my research but to
involve undergraduates in it as
well.’ ”

If faculty don’t come forward
with acceptable RAP projects for
this summer, Pitt will launch the
program in the fall, Brustein said.
He acknowledged that a March
15 deadline won’t give faculty
much time to prepare summer
proposals, but admitted he was
too excited about the program to
wait until fall. . .

In a Feb. 2 lecture at th
Honors College, Brustein em-
phasized that RAP won’t be lim-
ited to the humanities and social
sciences. “For example, it could
involve engineering faculty and
students working with German
ﬁrms or Indonesian ﬁrms,” he
said, “or a scientiﬁc project in-
volving environmental research

in a less developed country.”
Nor will RAP always be lim-

ited to Honors College students, '

Brustein said. Eventually, other
Pitt undergraduates will be eli-
gible. But to get the program off
to a good start, Brustein said, the

care physicians or the physicians
themselves who do not properly
process the claims or individual
health care providers who do not
code the proper information ——
these can all lead to errors on the
EOBs.”

Williams said the explanation
of "beneﬁts forms themselves re-
ﬂect only the information that
has been provided, sometimes
from a number of sources. “Some
of the problems have been char-
acterized as EOB errors, which
is somewhat of a misnomer,” he
said. “The explanation of ben-
eﬁts is simply a summary that

‘comes back to the member ‘of

what’s being paid to their pro-
vider, what’s not being paid, and
if it’s not being ‘paid, why.”
Williams said a number of
factors could lead to mistakes on
the form, at least some of which
are beyond the health plan’s con-
trol. Occasionally, a billing prob-
lem arises when a provider uses
outdated insurance information
on ﬁle, for example. i‘ '
“Another example is POS
participants who went to a pro-

vider and who didn’t coordinate I
their care with the PCP (pri-

mary care physician) and the

William Brustein. —
new director of UCIS

Honors College appeared to be
the best place to recruit RAP-
‘appropriate undergrads: mature,
independent, academically am-
bitious students who won’t goof
off orget homesick while spend-
ing at month or two overseas.
Last March, when Brustein
was being interviewed for the’
job of UCIS director, he said
one of'his goals here would be to

.3‘:-’j)ro‘r’i1ote study-abroad experi-
’ ences teaming undergrads with

faculty researchers.

Since beginning work here
Jan. 1, he’s been working out
RAP details durin g weekly meet-
ings with Stewart and Yucas. ‘

Pittundergraduateswhowant
to study abroad currently have
three basic options: traditional
“cultural immersion” programs
in which they_live and study in a

EOB spells that out. That’s not

-necessarily an error on the EOB.

Or, the claim may have come
through in a way that it was pro-
cessed or coded that was correct,
but the information on the claim
was incorrect, so [the bill] actu-
ally got paid based on what was
on the claim, but it does not
represent what happened in ac-
tuality.” . _. '

Another example, he said, is a
processed claim that does .not
list the PCP as a coordinator, for
instance, whenthe PCP autho-
rizes a referral. “If for some rea-
son that name didn’t get on the
claim ﬁle, the member would
have been [held] responsible for
the deductible and, where appli-
cable, the penalty insurance as if

[the treatment] wasn’t referred. -

“We see a number of issues
like this, similar to ones ‘Profes-
sor Hershey has pointed out. The
simple ﬁx to that is to call this [to
the health’s plan attention], men-
tion the referral and it gets re-
processed and corrected.”
Williams said health plan reps
also meet with Human Resources
beneﬁts ofﬁcials weekly.

Edgerton, ‘who attends that ,

meeting, described it as intense

foreign country for a term or
two; global studies through the
Semester at Sea program, and
individual ﬁeld research projects
through area studies units such
as Latin American Studies.
Brustein said he’s long found

it odd that most research univer- '

sities, including Pitt and his prior
employer, the University ofMin-
nesota, have not involved under-
graduates in what those schools
do best: cutting—edge research.
Addressing faculty attending
his Feb. 2 lecture, Brustein said:
“Like me, many ofyou have been
graduate students and you know

that we’re really not trained very _

much to be great teachers, un-
fortunately, at major research

universities. We’re’ hardly‘

trained to be administrators.
VVhat we’re really trained to do
is research. Then, when we get
jobs at research universities our-
selves, we work under the

-premise that, ‘Yes, we have

graduate students who will be
involved in our research. But
undergraduates? No, they’re not

equipped to work on serious,

scholarship.’

“I’ve often thought, we don’t
give our undergraduates enough
credit.” ,

Brustein credits his Univer-
sity of Minnesota undergradu-

ing possible his critically praised
book, “The Logic of Evil: The
Social Origins of the Nazi Party,
192 5-1933” ‘(Yale University
Press, .1 996). Through painstak-
ing research of Nazi Party
records in Berlin, Brustein’ ‘and
his studentjteam concluded that

~.

. ate research assistants with mak— I

Gerrnians"who supported the‘

Nazis were largely motivated by
economic self—interest. .
Brustein’s book reached some
controversial but. well—docu-
mented conclusions —- for ex-
ample, that contrary to tradi-
tional scholarly belief, Nazism
was not primarily a lower rr1iddle—
class phenomenon. Brustein’s
team found that prior to 1933
(the- year Hitler became

and productive. “We have an

excellent working relationship“

We meet .with the health plan

officials to ensure that issues are
being addressed,” he said. “The

ﬁrst part of the meeting also is‘

open to members of this‘ [ben-
eﬁts and welfare] committee to
bring concerns to us and the

health’ plan.” .

Edgerton said Human Re-
sources had been alerted to a
problem where UPMC Shady-
side had been charging a second

$10 co-payment for a facility’

visit, in addition to the appropri-

ate $10.co-payment charged for
. a doctor’s visit. “As soon as we

heard about that, we called the
health plan and ‘they put a stop to
that.” _

Williams said that the health
plan was compiling a list of mem-
bers who were double—billed by
UPMC Shadyside; those mem-
bers will be reimbursed.

“Finally, we remind mem-
bers that every time you use ’a
service, show them your [health
plan I.D.] card. It never hurts to
help make sure they have the
most current information on
ﬁle,” Williams said. i

ing the Nazi Party became a
careerist move), 40 percent of
p/arty’members were blue—collar
workers.

Minnesota‘ undergraduates
who later analyzed Nazi Party
records for gender trends found
that only 7 percent of party mem-
bers prior to 1933 were women,
but that 90 percent of those
women were single or divorced.
Students incorporated those
ﬁndings in their senior research
papers.

“That project convinced me
that collaborative research
projects involving undergradu-
ates could be beneﬁcial to both
the faculty member and the stu-
dents,” Brustein said. ,

But Brustein also felt frus-
trated at having to hustle for
funding to support his research
team, because Minnesota had no
programs encouraging under-

graduate participation in faculty _ 7

research.

_' Contrary to some faculty
members’ fears that undergradu-
ate assistants require babysitting,
Brustein found that his students
behaved responsiblyand seemed
just as excited by the research as
he was. Following their shifts at
the Berlin Documents Center,
the central repository of 11 mil-
lion Nazi member cards, stu-
dents would meet among them-
selves to discuss the project,
Brustein said. ' '

“Wespent 12 weeks in Ger-
many,” he said, “and there was
not one issue” of undergraduate
misbehavior.

Foundation-funded research
comparing anti—serr1itism in Ger-
many, France, Britain, Italy and
Romania from 1899 to 1939. His
research team, -which includes
several University of Minnesota
undergraduates, is combing daily
newspapers published in those
countries during that period.

’ Students are searching for cov-

erage of anti—semitic incidents as
well as all references to]ew_s (who
often are alluded _to with code
words, Brustein noted. Britain’s
Daily Mail, for example, com-
monly referred to Jews as “the
Izzies living in. the East End of
-London” or “recent Russian im-
migrants who are plaguing the
East End”). a __

Brustein said the book he’s
working_ on, to be published by

Cambridge University Press, will a

partly be a response to Daniel

i Jonah Goldhagen*’s best—selling

. — Bruce Steele

1996 book, “Hitler’s Willing
Executioners: Ordinary Ger-.
mans and the.Holocaust.”
Goldhagen concluded that Ger-

man anti—semitism was unique

in that it argued for extermina-

tion, rather than mere ostracism,
of Jews. ’ ,

“Implicit in that argument
was that anti-semitism must have
been somehow different in other
countries,” Brustein said. “I re-
acted: Okay, show me evidence
that Germany was ' different: I
realized that there hadn’t been a
systematic, comparative, empiri-
cal study of anti-semitism in the

‘years before the Holocaust.”

’ Brustein said that when his
book appears, its preface — like
the one for “The Logic of Evil”
-——-will credit his student research
assistants, _ including . the
undergrads among them.

States probably will
continue to squabble

over trade subsidies, defense
burden-sharing, and the pros and
cons of hormone—fortiﬁed poul-
try, British Labour Party" mem-
ber of Parliament Denis
MacShane told a Pitt audience
last week.

But as a new century begins,
both sides of the North Atlantic
share an all-but-unshakable com-
mitment to democracy, free trade
and the rule of law, he noted.

Economic and military policy
disagreements between America
and Europe are_“manageable,”
MacShane said in a Feb. 5 lec-
ture, “The European Union and
the United States: Partners or
Rivals?”

“Where there are emerging
problems between America and
Europe,” he cautioned, “is in the
area of conﬂicting values.”

MacShane contended that
Europe, in contrast to the United
States, is committed to building
inclusive societies where all citi-
zens are guaranteed health care,
a good education and adequate
housing. “It is what’s left of the
post-war welfare sentiment, but

 

it is very much going to remain a
core element of European val-
ues,” MacShane said.

In Europe, social liberalism
(decriminalization of cannibas,
legal recognition of same-sex

‘marriages, etc.) is In; private

ownership of guns is Out — the
mirror image of America. The
UK recently banned private citi-
zens from owning handguns.
“Anyone want to run [for politi-
cal ofﬁce in America] with that
one?” MacShane asked, as his
faculty and student audience in
4E5l Posvar Hall laughed.

While European leaders use
increasingly harsh language to
condemn capital punishment,
the United States continues to
execute prisoners. MacShane
noted that America would‘ be
disqualified from joining the
EU’s Council of Europe because
the Council bans countries that
perform state executions.

The EU, with a population
nearly twice that of the United
States, imprisons one—tenth as
many people. “Clearly, Ameri-
can unemployment ﬁgures are
helped when you keep 2 million
prime-age males in prison,”
MacShane quipped.

And while most American cit-
ies roll up their sidewalks at night,
Europe remains committed to a
Renaissance vision of cities as

_centers of social and political

development — aswell as fun
places to hangaround after work,
MacShane said.

In contrast to America (where
“the past is something that ap-
pears in museums,” MacShane
said), European societies cannot
escape their histories, he said.

Northern Ireland; it’s still not
resolved. . . .I have the impression
that the United States is a nation
that’s continually seeking to de-
fine a future and to break from
the past. The past in European
societies is economically, archi-
tecturally, culturally a part of
your being.”

MacShane repeatedly inter-
rupted himself to say: “Believe
me, I’m not making a moral judg-
ment here.” European values
aren’t better or worse than
American ones, he said — “but
they are different.”

Among the other EU-
America issues that MacShane

‘ talked about were:
0 European heterogeneity. De— _

spite vanishing trade barriers
within. the EU and a common
currency, “Europe will not come
together as ‘a single super—state,”
MacShane said. "National and
regional autonomy actually is
growing, he said, noting the fol-
lowing: There are now more
European nations than ever, in-
cluding eight where Yugoslavia
used to be. Within the United
Kingdom, Scotland and Wales
now have their own parliaments
and substantial self-governing
powers. France recently granted
semi—national status to Corsica.
In Spain, Catalonia and the
Basque region are distancing
themselves from the central gov-
ernment.

'0 English as an international

‘ language. “Our political leaders

are all learning’ one another’s
languages,” said MacShane, a
leadinginternational-trade union
ofﬁcialwho serves as the joint
Parliamentary secretary to the
UK Ministers of State for F or-

eign and Commonwealth Affairs. .

MacShane, who is ﬂuent in
French and German, said: “It’s a
lie that English is going to be-
come the international language.
It’s becoming a common lan-
guage, but it will not dominate.”

In Europe, where television
networks broadcast in dozens of
languages, TV actually sustains
cultural heterogeneity, Mac-

Shane said. “There’s no Euro-

pean CNN. There’s no Euro-
pean Dan Rather.” -
MacShane said he’s fascinated
by the growth of Spanish as a
second langua-ge in the United

' States. But America doesn’t be-

gin to compare with the EU in
terms of linguistic diversity, he
said.

VVhen an audience member
suggested that the spread of En-
glish as an international language
might promote peace and mu-
tual understanding among na-
tions, MacShane commented:

“Well, French was the interna-

tional language from about 1 500
to 1900, and you’ll remember
how the world lived in peace and
harmony back then.”

0 Defense. While the U.S.A.

» continues to spend proportion-

ately more than Europe on de-
fense, the gap is narrowing,
MacShane said. According to
NATO, last year America spent
3 percent of its GDP on defense,
while France spent 2.7 percent
and Britain spent 2.4 percent.
MacShane said Europe
“needs to get more of its act
together on defense. We found
that, out in Kosovo par-
ticularly...when we had to rely
100 percent on America for ef-

. fective air attacks and intelligent

satellites-

“But America had to rely al-
most 100 percent on Europe for
putting men on the ground,” he
added. “You can win battles
through air supremacy, but you
can’t actually [use air power to]
occupy countries and change re-
gimes,” as the West found out in
Iraq in 1990. “On the other hand,
we occupied Kosovo, which
meant that Milosovic no longer
could play the Kosovo card in-

side Serbia. It took him a year to '

go, but he’s gone.”

Some 48,000 EU troops cur-
rently are stationed in Bosnia
and Kosovo, compared with
11,400 U.S. troops, he pointed
out.

The United States still does
the lion’s share of defending the
North Atlantic alliance,
MacShane acknowledged. “But
in terms of ‘soft power,’ Europe
does more,” he said. “Between
1988 and 1998, America con-
tributed $9 billion in overseas
development funds to poor na-
tions. The EU gave $27 billion.

“America says Europe needs
to get tough,” MacShane added.
“But if you look at which nations
actually help to spread the mes-
sage of liberal market democ-
racy, Europe is spending much
more than the United States.

“If you look at recent his-
tory,” he concluded, “every seri-
ous defense of democratic values
has required America and Eu-
rope to work very closely to-
gether,” including in Kosovo and
the Gulf War. “VVhere we’ve
tried’ to go it alone, we haven’t
succeeded, as in [America’s mili-
tary action in] Somalia.”

0 Protectionism and agriculture.
America and the EU are always
bickering over subsidies,
MacShane said. “America
doesn’t like the [government ﬁ-
nancial] help that AirBus gets.
Europe looks at the $350 billion
that the U.S. Department of
Defense funnels into Boeing and
says, ‘If that’s not a tax subsidy,
what is?’”

VVhat’s strange is that both
America and the EU, with all of
their technological sophistica-
tion, continue to subsidize do-
mestic agriculture, MacShane
said. “Between us, we commit
daily crimes against the rest of
the world by protecting our re-
spective farming communities”

at the expense of poor nations ,

whose agricultural goods are ef-

fectively barred from U.S. and 4

EU markets. ’ .
0 Franco-American relations.
Recently, Germany and Britain

» have argued over which country

is truly “America’s Best Friend.”

“France, as you know, says:
‘We are” not America’s best
friend,’” said MacShane. “But
that is typical because France’s
problem is that France wants to
be America. You always hate what
you are. France, like America, is

an 18th century, universalist state '

that: believes it’s got a divine
mission to recreate the world on
its own model.” MacShane said
he’s entitled to make such "com-

ments, as the husband of a,
_ Frenchwoman.

MacShane’s lecture was co-
sponsored by the European
Union Center at Pitt’s Center
for West European Studies, Pitt’s

cultural studies department and

future, these devices will be
linked to one another, allowing
communication between them.
Eventually, it will be possible to
take digital pictures while walk-

ing around town and instantly e-
mail them to friends or post them
on a web-site.

With this sort of communi-
cation between devices comes
increased complexity and an in-
crease in the energy needed to
allow them to function efﬁ—
ciently. Childers’s research will
focus on “giving more function-
ality to these devices while keep-
ing the energy cost low.”

Former employee ﬁles suit against Pitt  

charging harassment based on disability

former employee is
V suing the Univer-
r sity, charging ha-

rassment and discrimination
based on his disability.

The University denies the
allegations, a Pitt spokesperson
said. ‘ .
Eugene A Heinack, who
worked in the Graphics, Mar-
keting and Printing department’s
printshop and bindery fromjune
1983 ‘until he resigned his posi-
tion in May 1999, alleges that
co—workers harassed and humili-
ated him over a period of years,
causing him to quit his job.

Heinack, who suffers. from

mental retardation, is suing the ~

University under the Americans
with Disabilities Act and the
Pennsylvania Human Relations
Act.

Heinack’s allegations against
co—workers include intimidation,
repeated verbal and physical
abuse, threats of physical retali-
ation and failure of his supervi-

sor to address the problems after -

he reported-them’.

The prolonged harassment
caused Heinack toiseek emo-
tional counseling and, eventu-

ally, to quit his job, the suit con-
tends. ,
Heinack further alleges that
although he performed his job
competently he was denied pay
increases, promotions and over-
time opportunities because of his

I disability.

On Sept. 7, 1999, Heinack
ﬁleda complaint with the Penn-
sylvania Human Relations Com-
mission (PHRC).

Suits «ﬁled at the state level
are automatically dual-ﬁled with
the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC),

according to an EEOC ofﬁcial. ,

The EEOC issued a notice of
the right to sue in October 2 000,
according to court documents.

Pitt’s director of News and
Information Ken Service said
that the University was informed
by the EEOC that Heinack’s
complaint had been dismissed as
“untimely,” that is, ﬁled after
more than 300 days from when
the alleged harm took place.

Attorneys Samuel Cordes and

Kathleen Davies, who are repre— ’

senting'Heinack in the suit, said
the suit was ﬁled in a timely
manner. “We have copies of the

CGS gets largest  ever

A local businessperson who is
a graduate of the College of
General Studies (CGS) has given
Pitt’s school for nontraditional
students a gift of $650,000 to
fund anew student center. It is

‘the largest ﬁnancial gift ever

made to CGS.
James McCarl, president and
CEO of McCarl’s Inc., a_

‘Sewickley plumbing and heat-

ing company, said he wanted to
donate money to CGS that would
“help make a difference.”

. The gift will be used to fund
the new McCarl Center for Non-
traditional Student Success, to
be located on the 4th ﬂoor of
Cathedral of Learning. ,

The center will provide a
home for services CGS offers to
its students, including orienta-
tion seminars for adults who have
been out of school fora number
of years; academic survival skills
seminars; success seminars, of-
fering strategies for balancing
the demands of family, work and

‘ college; career counseling semi-

nars; mentoring workshops; fi-

nancial aid workshops; an in-

ternship site; a student lounge,
and a tech station, where CGS
students can access the Internet
or checktheir e—mail.

“_Iim’s gift will affect the lives
of CGS students for years to

come, by improving the quality P

of their surroundings, and the
environment in which students,

said CGS Dean Susan Kinsey.
In addition, McCarl is donat-
ing $150,000 toward the con-
struction of a new Pitt Hall of
Fame that will be part of the
John M. and Gertrude_ E.

that courts routinely overlook

Carol Mohamed [Human Re-

lations] received a phone call
from [Heinack] in November
1999, more than six months af-
ter the employee resigned his

position. He was invited to a‘

meeting with her, but declined
the invitation. Carol investigated
the matter fully and could not
conﬁrm his allegations.” .
The plaintifFs attorneys,
however, contend that Heinack
“tried to contact Ms. Mohame‘d
‘several times by phone, leaving
messages for her, before he re-
signed his position in May 1999,
and she did not return any of his
phone calls until November

1999.” I ,
Cordes ‘added that, under
Pitt’s policies, Heinack’s super-

complaints to the appropriate
authorities and failed to do so.

against the University was ﬁled
Jan. 30 in the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Western Dis-

MC Health Plan now

breaking even, ofﬁcials say  

he UPMC‘ Health
_ Plan, which covers
about 12,000 Pitt em-

ployees, has turned a ﬁnancial
corner, health plan ofﬁcials said.
The plan is now breaking even
and has received a high ﬁnancial
rating by a top insurance rating
company.

A.M. Best Company Inc. re-
cently gave the UPMC Health
Plan’s ﬁnancial rating a B++ rat-
ing, that is, “very good.”

“We are pleased to receive
such a high rating from the
world’s oldest and most authori-
tative insurance rating com-
pany,” said Patricia Liebman,
chief executive ofﬁcer of UPMC
Health Plan. “We’re especially
pleased to have such a rating
even though we’ve only been in
the commercial healthbeneﬁts
business for two and half years.”

The B++ category is given to
insurance companies rated by
A.M. Best as having “very good
ﬁnancial strength, operating per-

, formance and market proﬁle.”

Those companies rated B++
“have a good ability to meet their
ongoing obligations to policy-
holders,” the A.M. Best insur-
ance report stated.

A.M. Best reviewed UPMC
Health Plan’s ﬁnancial informa-
tion in fall 2000. The review
included the company’s business
plan, market presence, adminis-
trative operations and projec-
tions for enrollment and medi-
cal costs, according to Patricia
Darnley, UPMC Health Plan’s
chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer.

“A.M. Best doesn’t just look
at what is reported to the state
insurance department, but in-
stead gets below the surface and
obtains a feel for the company by
viewing operations, meeting its
people. and asking important
questions,” Darnley said. “This
is important to us, since we’re a
start-up company.”

Start—ups have greater up-
front costs than established com-
panies, Darnley said, including
hiring people and building com-
puter and other business systems.
“If you look simply at ﬁnancial
reports, then a start—up in a strong
growth mode like UPMC Health
Plan will often get a lower rat-
ing.” Darnley said.

Darnley acknowledged that
the health plan had received a D-
minus rating ‘from Weiss Rat-
ings Inc. in 2000. “But you have

to evaluate and compare the
methodologies. Weiss is for-
mula—driven. They look only at
the Pennsylvania Insurance De-
partment ﬁnancial reports all in-
surers are required to file. They
do not make an on—site visit.”
A.M. Best, in contrast, stud-
ies the inner workings of a com-
pany, she said. They also took
into account the strength of the
health plan’s parent company,
UPMC Health System, with its
total assets of $3.7 billion.
Darnley said the health plan

is breaking even ﬁnancially and '

is expected to show a proﬁt by
this May, the next ﬁnancial re-
porting period. “We set a goal of

‘ 2 00,000 subscribers, which we’ve

surpassed. We are now moving
past the start-up phase, and have
most of our systems in place and
our processing is controlled in-
house. From all indications, we
will be moving up in the Best
ratings.” ‘

The health plan was founded
in 1996 as Best Health Care of
Western PA, a Medicaid HMO.
It was 85 percent owned by
UPMC Health System, which
purchased the remaining 15 per-
cent in 1997. Thatyear, the com-
pany ﬁled for commercial HMO
and point of service products and
changed its name to UPMC
Health Plan. .

RESEARCH l\lOTES

Wheelchair
users may be
at increased
risk in motor

‘ vehicle crashes

‘ Continued advances in
wheelchair mobility, driving ad-
aptations and vehicle modiﬁca-
tions, along with the passage of
the 1990 Americans with Dis-
abilities Act, have given persons
who use wheelchairs better ac-
cess to transportation, via both

‘public transportation and per-

sonal vehicles.

However, along with in-
creased travel miles and en-
hanced access may come an in-‘
creased risk of injury.

According to researchers at '

. Pitt’s School of Health and Re-

habilitation Sciences (SHRS),

when used as motorvehicle seats, »

commercially available wheel-
chairs not speciﬁcally designed
for transportation may not pro-
vide adequateoccupant protec-
tion in a_ crash.

Many wheelchair users are
unable to transfer to a vehicle
seat and remain seated in their

, wheelchairs while traveling.

Moreover, vehicle—mounted
occupant restraint systems,
which fail to provide proper belt
ﬁt, may further increase injury
risk by failing to protect the
wheelchair user in a crash.

These findings were pub-
lished in a recent issue of the
Journal of Rehabilitation Re-
search and Development.

Gina Bertocci and a team of

A SHRS researchers evaluated, in

6

four studies, the crashworthiness
ofwheelchair seating and‘wheel-
chair occupant restraint systems.
In almost all of the studies, re-
searchers found that standard
wheelchair seating components
failed to withstand simulated
crashes, placing wheelchair us-
ers at a greater risk of in'ury. .
In" two of the studies — one
that evaluated the crashworthi—
ness of commercially, available
wheelchair back supports an'd
one that assessed the effective-
ness of wheelchair occupant re-
straint systems in a frontal “crash
-—.— the components failed to with-

. stand a simulated crash or failed

to adequately protect the wheel-
chair user. 

In another study, Bertocci and
her colleagues utilized computer
simulations to provide design
criteria to aid manufacturers in
the development of transport-
safe wheelchairs,

“In most cases, typical seat
and wheel assemblies will not
sustain a crash well enough to
maintain a person in the position

. necessary for effective restraint,”

said Douglas Hobson, associ-
ate professor, SHRS, who wrote
a guest editorial in the journal.
“Substantial research is be-
ing conducted to improve the
safety of.vehicle seats and to im-
prove protection for the occu-

pant,” said Bertocci. “Manufac—

turers of automotive seats’ are
nowrequired to perform exten-
sive testing to ensure that ve-
hicles comply with government
crashworthiness standards. -Our
studies further prove that the
stringent standards that apply to
automotive seat manufacturers
need to be transferred to the

the project included Stephanie

van Roosmalen, Patricia Karg
and Ernest Deemer. ’

Study of tPA
use to brain
site begins" . R
Physicians at UPMC Health
System Stroke Institute are be-
ginning a ‘study to determine
whether administering tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) di-

rectly through an artery to the

site of blockage in the brain, in
addition to giving it systemically
through a’-vein, can help improve
patient outcome during a stroke.

The clot busting drug tPA is
already an approved and effec-
tive treatment when given
through a vein to patients who
have strokes due to an artery
blockage in the brain, if given
within three hours from the on-
set of symptoms. Used intrave-
nously in certain patients having
a stroke, tPA dissolves the clot
and restores blood ﬂow to the
brain. Using a catheter to deliver

. . the drug directly to the_clot in

the brain may improve the effec-
tiveness of the drug in dissolving
clots.

“Duringa stroke, cells in the 2

area of the brain that are not
receiving blood begin to die im-
mediately. The quicker we can
dissolve a clot and restore blood
ﬂow, the more brain cells we can
save,” said Lawrence Wechsler,
director the Stroke Institute and
principal investigator in the

- study. “Intravenous administra-

tion of tPA is- the only approved I

treatment for acute ischemic
stroke. A limitation of this ap-
proach is that large clots are less
likely to dissolve in a sufﬁciently
short time frame to improve a
patient’s outcome. Our studywill
go one step further and attempt
to determine if delivering tPA
directly to the site of the blood
clot in addition to intravenous
tPA is safe and more effective in

» reducing the damagefrom

stroke.”

Stroke is the third most com-
mon cause of death and the lead-
ing cause of adult disability in
the United States. Some 700,000
Americans suffer a stroke each
year; 70 percent of these are is-
chemic strokes in which a clot
blocks oxygen delivery to a por-
tion of the brain. On average,
someone in the United States
suffers a-stroke every 5 3 seconds
and 160,000 Americans die an-
nually from stroke. '

Stroke symptoms include:
weakness or paralysis, on one side
of the body, numbness or loss of
sensation on one side of the body,
difﬁculty with speech or inabil-
ity to speak, sudden onset of loss
of balance or dizziness and sud-
den loss of vision in one eye.

Study‘ using
imaging 0

to find cause

of bipolar
disorder

Pitt researchers are using new
imaging techniques to examine
biological factors that may cause
bipolar disorder, commonly
known as manic-depression, with
the hope of ﬁnding better treat-
ments.

The study, conducted at

 

‘Western Psychiatric Institute

and Clinic (VVPIC), makes use
of a new type of imaging tech-
nology called magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy. MRS allows

' scientists to study living human 0

brain neurochemistry by exam-
ining naturally occurring iso-
topes. The technology also may

” prove to be a powerful tool for

drug developers.

Bipolar disorder affects about
1.5 percent of the population,
accounting for nearly 4.5 mil-
lion people in the United States
alone. The most common treat-
ment for the disorder is lithium,
which works for 50-60 percent
of patients.’ For patients" who do
not respond to lithium, or who
cannot tolerate it, there are few

available alternatives.

“Our study will use advanced
imaging technology to look into
the brains of people withbipolar
disorder so we can ﬁnd underly-
ing problems with brain chemis-
try,” said Jair C. Soares, assis-
tant professor of psychiatry, and
director, Neurochemical Brain
Imaging Laboratory, VVPIC.

“Initial studies using MRS to
gauge concentrations and phar-
macokinetics. of lithium and
other medications used to treat
mental illness show the technol-

' ogy to be very effective in trac-

ing the path of these medica-
tions within the brain. That abil-

ity will allow. us to work with

drug manufacturers to develop
effective treatments.”

Internet and employed people
who made web browsing on
McCain’s, site appear to be an
initiation to activism, which
helped the candidate raise more
than $10 million on-line.

Green Party candidate Ralph
Nader’s web site had a clean and
efﬁcient design, they wrote, and
helped mobilize volunteers‘, es-
pecially students on college cam-
puses. ‘

Vice President Al Gore’s site
offered tools to potential sup-
porters or “warriors” to become
one—person campaign stops and
hook up with other warriors to
form a “tribe.”

Republican candidate George
W. Bushoffered tightly written,
regularly delivered e-mails when
the campaign got tough and an
efﬁcient system for rebutting —
“e—buttling” —- Gore’s debate
claims.

Bush’s digital efforts sur-
passed Gore’s during the “sec—
ond campaign,” after the near-
national voter tie and the politi-
cal and legal wrangling in
Florida, according to the profes-
sors. ‘

The Bush web site posted a
call to contribute to his post-
election campaign in Florida and

reinforced his message with an _

effective e—mail effort, Lewicki

and Ziaukas wrote. Gore, how-
ever, posted information about

the status of the recount in '

Florida that was already out of
date.

"The successful presidential
Internet candidate in 2004 or
2008, they wrote, will raise
money like McCain, develop
warrior tools like Gore, have a
clean and efﬁcient design like

if Nader and have regularly, tightly

written e-mails and efﬁcient e-
buttling like Bush, the profes-

Nursing study

' looks at how

endocrine
chan es
contribute to
antisocial
behavior

Antisocial behavior in youth
is a growing problem. Childhood
antisocial behaviors (e.g., con-
duct problems) can become
chronic as reﬂected in delin-
quency, adult interpersonal and
domestic violence, and other
criminal behavior. .

. The majority of studies of
antisocial behavior have focused
on individual psychological fac-
tors, or peer and neighborhood
inﬂuence. Few studies have con-

sidered physiological aspects of
antisocial behavior in children,
in spite of the growing evidence
linking physiological processes
and crime in adults.

Pitt’s School of Nursing re-
cently received a three—year grant
from the National Institute of
Nursing Research to study how
endocrine changes contribute to
conduct problems in adolescents.

“We will examine the rela-
tionship between gonadal and
adrenal hormone concentrations
and conduct problems in chil-
dren,” said Lorah Dom, princi-
pal investigator and assistant pro-
fessor at the nursing school’s
Department of Health Promo-
tion and Development. “We also
want to determine whether go-
nadal and adrenal hormones
moderate the effect of treatment
on conduct problems and
whether treatment of conduct
problems alters gonadal and ad-
renal hormones, of children with
conduct problems.” _

Dorn’s study will merge with
David Kolko’s existing random-
ized trial designed to compare
the efﬁcacy of a multimodal pack-
age of specialized services di-
rected toward children, parents,
and families in modifying severe
conduct problems. Kolko is an
associate professor of child -psy-
chiatry and psychology at Pitt’s
School of Medicine and a- co-
investigator on Dom’s study.

Problem
drinking
affects
adherence to
HIV medication

‘ Problem‘ drinking affects ‘

medication adherence among
individuals with HIV, according
to a study by the University of
Pittsburgh Center for Research
on Health Care. Failure to ad-
here to a strict schedule of medi-

cation severely limits an HIV‘

patient’s survival.
“The results of this study

emphasize the importance of

screening for alcohol problems
among persons with HIV,”'said

principal investigator Robert L. _

Cook, a Pitt assistant professor
of medicine. Byidentifying prob-
lem drinking, he said, doctors
can better treat their patients,
providing them with the super-
vision and support they need to
adhere to their medication regi-
mens. . ‘
Alcohol consumption, in-
cluding excessive drinking, is
common in theHIV population,
according to the study published
in the February issue of theJour—
_nal of General Internal Medi-
cine.

The Pitt study is one of the
ﬁrst to look at the relationship
between excessive drinking and
medication adherence in those

with HIV. HIV patients must

follow a strict medication sched-
ule. Even a few missed doses or
taking HIV medications off
schedule can result in viral resis-
tance.

with HIV about missed or off-
schedule medication doses and
about their drinking habits. The
researchers categorized problem
drinkers in three ways: women
who had ﬁve alcoholic drinks
and men who had six alcoholic
drinks at one sitting at least once
a month, women who had more
than 12 drinks and men who had
more than 16 drinks weekly; and
women and men with high scores
on the Alcohol Use Disorders

-Identiﬁcation Test. .

Problem drinkers were more
likely to take their HIV medica-
tions off schedule, the research-
ers found. Nearly half of the
problem drinkers reported tak-

ing their medication off sched-

ule during the previous week,
compared to 26 percent of those
without problem drinking be-
haviors. ‘ ~

Researchers cautioned that -

clinicians should not assume that
problem drinkers will be unable
to follow complex medical regi-
mens. They recommended that
clinicians should work with pa-
tients individually to develop
strategies to help them adhere to
their HIV medications. I
