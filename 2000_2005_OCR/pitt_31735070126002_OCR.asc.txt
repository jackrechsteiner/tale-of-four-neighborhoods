VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 56

PAUL WATSON
Los Angeles Times

GANIKHIL, Afghanistan — With a
family wedding two days away and the
Taliban’s front—line positions more than
two miles _up the road, the jet noise over-
head must have sounded like someone
else’s problem.

4 Koko Gol was in a second-ﬂoor room
of her house Saturday afternoon, sewing

' clothes for her brother—in—law’s wedding,
as two U.S. ﬁghter jets circled overhead,
preparing to attack the Taliban.

Instead, one bomb landed on Gol’s
home in a village controlled by the main
U.S. allies here, the Northern Alliance.
The blast killed G01 and seriously injured
her son and daughter, ages 5 and 6, along
with at least seven other people.

“We were planning for the wedding
of my brother, who is now injured and in
the hospital,” said Gol’s husband, Mirza
Khan, who was slightly wounded and was
still trembling from the blast almost a day
later. ‘‘I was taking care of the sheep and

_ goats outside when the bomb fell.”

On Sunday, the bornb’s aluminum tail
ﬁns, painted green, were scattered in the
rubble of the home’s dried-mud bricks,
which were blown to pieces that spilled

down in a torrent of debris into the garden.

The bombing was at-least the ﬁfth by
U.S. jets on the wrong side of the front
line north of Kabul, the Afghan capital.
The Italian-run emergency hospital for
war wounded said three people died
Saturday when a U.S. ﬁghter struck Raqi,
another alliance—held front—line village.
That report could not be independently
veriﬁed.

In addition, news reports from Kabul
said 13 civilians were killed there Sunday
whenjairstrikes aimed at the Taliban hit
residential neighborhoods.

The attacks in Northern Alliance teni—
tory added to a sense among Afghans here
that the United States is going about its

‘ strikes on the Taliban in the wrong way.

Saturday’s bombing of Ganikhil
came on the heaviest day of airstrikes
along the front line north of Kabul. On
Sunday, the skies were quieter than they
had been for days. A single U.S.‘ ﬁghter jet
streaked in around 4:20 p.m. to drop just
one bomb, which struck Tota Khan, a hill-
top Taliban outpost struck repeatedly over
the past eight days.

Accidental bombing of Northern
Alliance territory showed the need for
closer cooperation with U.S. forces, the
alliance’s foreign minister, Abdullah, told

 Residence hall security tighterat Pitt than elsewhere

CHIRAG DEVASKAR
Staff Writer

Pitt has a residence hall security policy that is tighter

“The campus is extremely small so faces are familiar »
and it is “easy to detect someone who does not belong,” she
said, adding that CMU has no sign-in policy for visitors.

Kenton Kline, a CMU junior, said he thinks the

than that of many Pemtsylvania universities.

An informal survey conducted by The ‘Pitt News,
which sampled security measures at Penn State University,
Clarion University, Edinboro University, Allegheny

College, Carnegie Mellon University and Pitt, showed that _

. security rules depend heavily upon the location of the cam-

_ pus and the population of the school.

Pitt, located in the most urban setting of any of the sam-‘
pled schools, maintains 24—hour desk attendants in all resi-
dence halls. The attendants are employed by a non-univer-
sity ﬁrm called U.S. Security.

In addition, all visitors must show photo identiﬁcation‘

' if at sign—in, be escorted by the resident at all times and sign

»out by 2 a.m. on weekdays.

Dr. Stephen Sivulich, the assistant director of residence
life, pointed to Pitt’s urban setting as the primary reason
behind these policies, saying that they are in place for the
“ rotection of privacy and security of residents.” _ j

‘ Matt Swadley, a sophomore and ‘former Towers-
dweller now living in Forbes Hall said he thinks some of the

policies are rough but said that they are very effective for
maintaining a safe environment. ,

CMU, located less than a mile down Forbes Avenue
from Pitt, has a different set of policies, in large part because

the campus is smaller and a lot less busy, according to Nina

DiP_rimio, a desk attendant in a residence hall there.

school’s policy is adequate.

“I feel completely safe in my dorm,” he said. “I leave
my door open all the time and I have no problems with
going down the  to another room for half an hour or
more and leaving my door wide open.”

Penn State, which has the largest attendance of any
school in Pennsylvania, also has strict guidelines. Unlike

-Pitt, the university has no sign-in policy for visitors, but non— '

residents must be escorted by someone living in the specif-
ic building. a

' In addition, PSU’s residence halls are locked through-
out weekends and at 5 p.m. each evening until 8 am. the fol-
lowing morning. _

Conal Carr, Penn State’s assistant director of residential
life, said that having such rules _in place is “good common
sense,” and that they “provide students with the best securi-
ty we can.” '

Clarion University has security guidelines similar to

Followingla protracted legal struggle, a

UPMC transplant surgeon and two medical

corporations armounced an international

manufacturing agreement last Friday at the

Duquesne Club Downtown.
Pitt surgeon Dr. Jerome Canady and
Huttinger-Trurnpf signed a manufacturing

agreement along with Conrned Corporation"

to manufacture and distribute the Canady
Catheter.

The Canady Catheter, named after its
inventor, is comprised of an electric wire that
runs through a pencil tip-sized tube. Argon

, gas, which ﬂows along the electrical current,

allows a beam of energy to eradicate polyps
and tumors and cauterize ulcers and bleed-
ing tissue. ~ V

. ‘‘It’s well-known, this technology,”
Canady said.

Canady, a clinical transplant fellow at
Pitt’s Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation
Institute, received a U.S. patent in 1993 and
a European patent in 1999. In the interim,
German-based Erbe Elektromedizin devel-
oped a similar electrosurgical device, which
it started marketing in the United States.

Canady ﬁled a lawsuit alleging patent

ing, but the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed
the former ruling. ,

After ﬁnding withheld documents in
April 1999, Canady reﬁled a motion for the
reconsideration of the U.S. District Court’s
ruling. The court, reversing its previous deci-
sion, found that Erbe had committed fraud
and misconduct and ordered the company to
pay the doctor’s legal fees. ' ~

“I’m the originator,” Canady said. “This
is my technology. . .I’m happy.'Trumpf basi-
cally brought this to the foreﬁont by partner-
ing with me.”

By partnering with Huttinger-Trumpf

and Conrned, Canady will be able to market _
~ hisinvention in the United States. '

Michael Martin, a representative of

Huttinger-Trumpf, said that the device ‘

should be available in operating roorrrs very
soon.
“We willtrytohavethis outinAme1ica
in half a year. . .pending FDA approval,”
Martin said.  r

The new technology is being hailed as
the biggest advance in electrosurgery in 80
years and is expected to take over the elec-
trosurgical market in two years.

Some would say the information age

began in the 1980s. Others  it was
the advent of the mainstream Internet that
touched off the information age.

But Pitt’s School of Information
Sciences is celebrating 100 years of training
librarians, developing telecommunications
and helping the community. _

“Libraries are more than repositories of
past human endeavor, they are instruments
of civilization,” said Dr. Vartan Gregorian,
president of the Carnegie Corporation of
New York.

Gregorian’s speech, given on May 30, 2001 I

kicked elf Pitt’s, School of Information
Sciences’ centennial celebration.

Founded in 1901 as the Training
School of Chﬂdren’s Librarians, SIS con-
centrates its work in four main areas ——-
library sciences, telecommunications, inter-
national and cultural studies and communi-
ty involvement.

In addition to the May speech, SIS fac-
ulty, students and alumni marked the cen-
tennial with other events. For instance, the
local chapter of the Special Libraries
Association, Beta Phi Mu, will host a peri-
od fashion show. - I

To commemorate this milestone SIS

SIS celebrates centennial

published “Tradition in Transition” by Carol '

Bleier, which provides accounts and pho-
tographs from the past 100 years. A press
release issued by SIS said that “Tradition,”
“focuses on the individuals who shaped the
values, curriculum teaching, learning,
research, scholarship and service of SIS .”
"l‘radition” also details SIS’s commu-
nity service—oriented curriculum. Carbo said
the book showcases “pictures of people

working in the ‘inner city with poor chil— ' - t Z

dren.” 
Notable

in 1987 and being the first information sci-
ences school to host a ‘telecommunications
program. . ’ 1

Other areas where SIS broke ground

include health librarianship, a track rated «

ﬁrst in the nation by “U.S. News & World
Report” in 1999. SIS also featured the
nation’s ﬁrst course in information science,
started in the early1960s.

Among SIS’s other accomplishments,

the school is the only one in the United

States to offer an orrline master’s degree.

Students from as far away as southemg

Florida and Las Vegas have earned graduate
degrees in library and information sciences.
SIS spokeswoman Sue Alrnan said,
“We’ve gone from a training school for chil-
dren’s librarians to a world class school.”

less strict. guidelines regarding their resi-

Edinborogives students some say in
determining some of the guidelines for res-
idence hall security. While exterior doors
are locked at 9 pm. and it is mandatory that
all guests be signed in and be escorted
throughout the residence halls, the residents
can vote to extend visitation hours from the
standard 11 am. to 1 pm. during the week.

Most residence halls voted to have vis-
itation privileges 24 hours a day, seven days
a week According to Duane Schlosser, the
associate director of residence life at the
school, students are given these privileges
becauseEdinboro is locatedinaruralset—
ting and they don’t experience signiﬁcant
problems with security.

Allegheny College locks its residence

1 halls from 10 p.m. until 7 am. Guests can

visit any time they wish, even without a res-
ident escort. But if residents ﬁnd that these
guidelines aren’t providing enough safety,
they can vote to enact more strict rules
regarding locked hours, guests and escorts.

More questions than answers

Yesterday evening, jittery Americans
gathered around their televisions, as they
have so many times in the last seven weeks,
to hear the latest update about terrorism.
This time, it came from Attorney ‘General
John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert
Mueller.

Their update? From a credible source,
they expect more terrorist attacks — not
“speciﬁc as to intended target or intended
method,” as Mueller put it — in the next
week

But that’s it. We’re supposed to expect
more terrorist attacks in the next week
Where? When? How? No one knows.

Ashcroft told Americans to “remain
alert and to report unusual circumstances
and inappropriate behavior to the appropri-
ate authorities.” In other words, we must
remain vigilant, as other Bush administra-
tion oﬂicials have told us repeatedly.

But what is vigilance? Webster’s
Dictionary deﬁnes it as “staying watchful
and alert to danger or trouble.”

How? On our walks to class, should we
be checking under bushes for suspicious
packages? What are “unusual circum-
stances and inappropriate behaviors”?

Will this lead to more racial proﬁling?

Where is the line between vigilance
and paranoia? How vigilant can we be
without letting it disrupt our normal func-
tioning?

Are these warnings becoming repeti-
tive and numbing? Or could it be helpful for

the public to be more alert? Can a refresher
about this every once in a while help? Was
the public’s guard down already?

Wﬂl alerting the public prevent the -

threat from coming true? Wﬂl the terrorists
have lost their element of surprise, as
Mueller speculated concerning the Oct 11
warning? ’

How much should they have told us?
Should we know any more than this? Or
would it cause widespread panic? Would it
jeopardize a source? Do Mueller and
Ashcroft even know any more than they’ve
told us? '

Could this warning itself cause more
harm than good? 5

What can we do? If the threat is bio-
logical, do we wear gas masks all the time
and take antibiotics as a precaution? If it’s a
repeat of Sept. 11, should people who work
at places like the Sears Tower not show up
for their jobs during the next week? Or do
we act like we did on Sept 10?

And what effect will this have on the
economy? In light of last r1ight’s threat,
what will the Dow Jones Industrial Average
be at the end of today?

" And what about Game 3 of the World
Series tonight, to be played at Yankee
Stadium in the Bronx? Wﬂl the presence of
President George W. Bush, who is throwing
out the ﬁrst pitch, be an extra risk?

We had a relatively‘ certain reality
before Sept. 11. Now, we just have ques-
tions without answers.

Ten things to make you happy

One of the three people who read
my column noted recently that there
is too much negativity inthe news
and I should prove that the world is
still good. So here are 10 happy
things sure to numb the pain of real-
ity and bring a smile to your" face, if
only for a few minutes:

1. Music —— More specifically,
Weezer. It takes a truly brilliant
group of gentlemen to mix rock ‘n’

Nothing was more fulfilling in my
junior high years than my daily ritu-

bad. I watched in awe as Zack

vacation to find an unexpected party
in their house. I fell in love with

heart shatter when she and Jessie

sweaters and be taken
seriously. And not only
are they taken seriously
but have an extremely
loyal fan base that almost

2. Dick Cheney — Hey, where is
he? Sometimes I am able to get
through a tedious lecture simply
because the gearsin my head are
turning diligently, conjuring up theo-
ries as to where our reclusive vice
president might be hiding. My most
plausible theory is that he’s taking an
Al Gore‘-style approach to the posi-
tion. In three years, we’ll receive
reports that, contrary to popular
belief, he is actually alive.

THE PITT NEws

Chili, pumpkin pie, friends offer unlikely solutions to stress

Here’s a quick quiz: Do you feel
like you’ve taken.900 midterms and
written 30_ or so 10-page papers in
the past few weeks?. Does feeling
well rested seem like a distant mem-

* -ory? Have you been surviving on an

all-caffeine/nicotine/Ramen diet?
Has it been weeks since you got
more physical. exercise than just
stumbling to _the Cathedral of
Learning for class every day?

If you answered yes tomost or

. all of these questions, then congratu-

lations: you’re an average Pitt stu-
dent living through midterms.

And that panicky feeling in the
pit of your stomach —— the feeling
that you’ll start crying or screaming
if you face one more pop quiz — is
stress.

Many college students find their
stress relief in a bottle or other mind-
altering forms. But this weekend I

discovered another form of stress’

relief.
After a few weeks —-" or, in reali-

ty, an entire semester —— of too much‘ ‘

work and far too little sleep, I decid-
ed I needed a weekend to unwind.
And lacking the energy to find some
party in a South Oakland basement
and drink until I couldn’t even

rememberthe names of my classes -

— much less my assignments in said
forgotten classes —— I knew I needed
a more low-key way to relax.

I’ve always loved fall — espe-

cially the leaves falling, pumpkin pie

eating and jack—o—lantern carving. So

I decided to have my own mini fall ,

fiesta, complete with pumpkin pie,
chili, corn muffins and pumpkin
carving — keyiingredients to help a
very exhausted group of college stu-
dents de-stress.

After sending out my invitations,
I searched the Internet for recipes.
Did you realize that a search for

‘ “pumpkin” in America Online’s food

and cooking section returns recipes
for an amazing 466 pumpkin-based

‘ dishes? Daunted by this plethora of

pumpkin goodies, I decided,to go

with an old favorite: Libby’s pump-"

kin pie. ,

The next step was finding a chili
recipe. One of my friends won’t eat
red ‘meat and one of my roommates is
a vegetarian, so I decided to go veg-
gie. I finally settled on “spicy garden
chili,” but only after my boyfriend
vetoed a tofu chili recipe.

One of the most enjoyable parts

of the whole process was the trip to

the grocery store. As lame as it may
sound, I really do love grocery shop-
ping- 7

Try it sometime. If you’re feeling
under the weather or depressed
because of the perpetually gray
Pittsburgh sky, the produce section

‘delicious,

can be a poor college student’s sub-

stitute for a trip to the
country.

As soon as you walk
into the grocery store,
your entire line of vision
becomes filled with
orangeswapples, tomatoes
and weirdly named, but
fruits, like
pomegranates and star

'anise. Just holding a pear

or a green pepper will
make you feel healthier —'

 

Nancy Red”dy

Columnist

worth of groceries later, I walked

back out to the parking
lot already feeling
calmer. I spent most of
Sunday afternoon slicing
up onions, peppers and
mushrooms for the chili,
and. then mixing the
ingredients for the pump-
kin pie.

Although I’ve never
been a great cook and the
tiny kitchen in my apart-
ment is not exactly con-

even if you haven’t actually eaten a ducive to cooking, the scent of chili
simmering mixed with thexpumpkin
About half an hour and $45 pie aroma proved very soothing.

vegetable in days.

Homemade dinner with friends
turned out to be just what I needed to
relax.

So next time you’re feeling like
your head is going to explode from
stress, get a couple friends together,
mix up something warm and sooth-
ing like chili and bake some pumpkin
pie —— it’s like a mini Thanksgiving
break, minus the annoying relatives.

Of course, next weekend I’ll
probably be back to drinking my
stress away with beer.

Adult stem cells
indeed work

Ed Miller hit it on the head in

his column (“Time debating stem
cell research costs lives,” Oct.

24) when he charged the political,‘

debates on stem cells with need-
lessly costing lives.

This part of his article is ‘
entirely correct, though not in the .

way. he intended. The endless
refusal of politicians like Sen.
Arlen Specter T (R—Pa.) to
acknowledge the real potential of
adult stem cells is sending our
nation on a wild goose chase with
unethical embryonic stem tech-
nology. '
Miller failed to note that we
can get adult stem cells to take on
any identity we wish. This wasn’t
case a year or two ago, but it now
works. We have already replaced
bone marrow with umbilical cord
stem cells and have developed a
cure for a progressive skin disor-

.der with stem 'cell..tran'$plants.
- By contrast, in February this ’

year it was revealed that embry-

onic stem cell treatments had A.
' worsened

the symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease sufferers. Yet-
we still seesenators (and writers
like‘ Miller) insisting that
embryos are the only way to go.
Science, to say nothing about
bioethics, tells a very different
story from what Miller wrote.

Blue-Gold game tonight

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Tonight’s Blue—Gold scrimmage at the
Fitzgerald Field House will offer a chance to
get an close-up look at the new 2001-02
men’s basketball team. '

Coming off a 19-14 record last season,
its best in a decade, Pitt locked up head
coach Ben Howland with a contract exten-
sion that ensures his services through the
2005-06 season.

Pitt will feature four players in the line-
up this season that will be suiting up for the
ﬁrst time. Guard Yuri Demetris and forwards
Mark McCarroll and Chevy Troutman were
all redshirted last season, while forward
Ontario Lett transferred from Pensacola
Junior College.

“I know that we’re going to make some
mistakes but I really like this group of kids,”
Howland said. “This is by far the best chem-
istry that we’ve had as a unit since I got
here.” A

Howland does have some experience
returningtohisteam,whichmadeitalltlie
way to the Big East Toi1rnarnent’s
Championship game last season, before los-
ing to Boston College.

Leadingtheteamatpointguardwillbe
junior Brandin Knight, a three-year starter.
Knight ranked ﬁfth in steals and assists last

 

season in the Big East

Howland noted that the 19-year old
junior has been doing a good job of being
vocal and leading his teammates, during

Joining Knight in the backcourt is
sophomore Julius Page, who started 25
straight games last season. Page averaged
nine points per game last season as a true
freshman, which was good for second best
on the team.

At the three position is Donatas
Zavackas, a proven outside threat. Zavackas
is joined in the ﬁontcourt by Troutman,
McCarroll and 6-feet-9 inch, 280 pound cen-
ter Toree Monis. p

Monis saw his playing time throughout
last season, starting one game, while then-
senior starter Isaac Hawkins was injured.

“IthinkthatToreeisabetterpostpres-
ence than Isaac Hawkins or Chris Seabrooks
by far on the offensive end, so I actually have
more conﬁdence with our low-post game
than I’ve had in our previous two years,”
Howland said. Hawkins graduated last sea-
son and Seabrooks was thrown off of the
team last season for violating team riﬂes.

The void that must be ﬁlled stems from
the graduation of forward Ricardo Greer,
who is cimeriﬂy playing basketball in the
Ukraine. Greer was the team’s go-to man
last season as he averaged 16.6 points and

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

7.4 rebounds per game, while serving as an »
emotional leader too. . 1

“Obviously we’1l miss him but we have
a lot of guys back,” he said. “I think that
taking off from where we ﬁnished is some-
thing that we’re trying to stress.” ,

Pitt ﬁnished in the second round of ,  A
the National Invitational Tournament ‘ '
,losing a close game at home to
Nlississippi State, 66-61. Pitt won its
opening round game against St.
Bonaventure, 84-75.

Howland said that he has more
depth to work with this year and
although’ McCarroll, Troutrnan and
Demetris haven’t played in a game yet, all ._
three practiced as members of the team. '

Deptliwise, in the backcourt, Knight
will play the point position and Page and
Troutman will play at shooting guard. In the
frontcourt Chad Johnson will play small for-
ward, with Zavackas and Troutman splitting
time between small and power forward.

Harris looks to follow ginia Tech’s blueprint

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Was Pitt head coach Walt Harris surprised when
Syracuse beat Virginia Tech on Saturday 22-14? “No,”
Harris said. “We_ knew how good Syracuse was.” .

For the Panthers, the 2001 campaign has been nothin

“I haveno control over how they respond,” Harris said. ’

“They will be ready to play. They didn’t get to where they are
now by not showing up after losing.” \
The Panthers, on the other hand, are coming otf their

 

ﬁrst conference win of the season, with ﬁeld goal kicker Nick 
Lotz being named Big East Conference Special Teams ,
Player of the Week for his effort against Temple. Lotz was a '

more then a growing pain. When Hanis took over as coach
ﬁve years ago, he knew the Pitt program wouldn’t miracu-
lously be in national championship contention right away.
But Hanis did know what team he wanted to follow:
Virginia Tech.

When the Hokies’ head coach Frank Beamer took the
job at Virginia Tech 15 years ago, he took over for a strug-
gling football program. Since then, Beamer has tumed the
team around, going 105-62-2 and making Virginia Tech into
a national contender. —

And Hanis kept his eye on them the whole time.
“Virginia Tech, we try to model ourselves after,” Harris said.
‘They had a tough time trying to rebuild, but they stuck in
there.”

At ﬁrst Harris said that he enjoyed watching how the
Hokies played defense in their 4-3 set. The Panthers matched
that defensive style and will go into Saturday’s game with a

Contraction

can improve
baseball

  

 

Spolrrs Vnzw
Joe Marchilena V

For some time now, the bigwigs of
major league baseball have discussed con-
traction as one way to make the sport more
competitive. ‘

‘Many feel that by removing a couple of
 and holding a dispersal draft, the
teams ‘af'_t11_e bottom of the standings can

acquire a few good players that they" other— .

wise would not have the opp_o_r_tunity to
obtain.    
Contraction is an excellent idea. After

3 adding four franchises in the last decade, the

talent level in baseball has plummeted.
There are many players on major" league

' rosters now that would never have  a

shot at making it to ﬂie big leagues 15 years

330- 
Pittsburgh is a perfect example of this.

There have been plenty of timesin the past '

nine years that the Pirates looked like they
would have a hard time competing at the
Triple A level, let alone at the major league
level.

Fortunately for Pittsburgh, the Pirates
have not been considered candidates for
contraction, thanks to the construction of
PN C Park ‘

The mentioned teams include the
Expos, who drew an average attendance of
just over 7,000 ‘a game last season; the
Marlins, whose attendance wasn’t much
better, the Devil Rays, who had the second
worst record in baseball and the Twins.

Given the success the Twins had last _

season and the promise the Marlins young-
sters showed in 2001, it would be likely that
those two teams would be dissolved The
Expos and Devil Rays both ﬁnished in last

' placeand the future for both teams is not

bright. 7
- But getling rid of two of the league’s

'worst teams won’t make. baseball more

competitive. If the owners really want to
make the league more competitive, then
they should get rid of the Yankees.

I’m not saying that the Yankees should
be abolished altogether. Just place their

Swimming and diving still dominating

JEREMY JESTER & FIONA BULLEN
The Pitt News

Eric Lirnkernann has a strong lead in
the 1000 freestyle, but head coach Chuck
Knolles is screaming, whistling and
pounding on the starter box urging him on.
It isg clear the sophomore will win the
event, but Knolles wants more.

f‘Here at the University of Pittsburgh,
we are goaling ourselves to move into the
top-l5,” Knolles said. “If we are going to
do that, we have to ‘put performances on

V the line.”

The Pitt swimmers and divers opened

their home meet schedule with a sweep of

St. Bonaventure Friday. Both the men and
women won all 13 of their events.

Knolles was not thrilled with their ﬁrst
meet of the year, but was not disappointed
with the 197-46 win either.

“We didn’t swim as well as we
should’ve,” he said, “but this was our ﬁrst
meet.”

The Panthers’ diving team was led by
Matthew Schwartz and Blair Beal, who
won the l—meter and 3-meter diving
events, with scores of 194.05 and 196.9,
respectively. ’

Diving coach Julian Krug was espe-
cially pleased with Schwartz.

“He did an excellent job on the 1-

meter,” Krug said. “And he did a dive that
has been bugging him a lot on the 3-meter
and did the best one of his life.”

In the pool, Lirnkernann won both
long freestyle events with times of 4:43.31
in the 500 and 9:29.12 in the 1000.
Raymond Brush had wins in the 200
Individual Medley and 100 breast with
times of 1:55.65 and 57.24, respectively.

Even with the impressive win, Knolles
said he believes his team has to do much
more than just win.

“People_are not going to recognize us
if wepare just okay" and beat an unranked

The women won 187-56 to even their

The men’s and women’s swimming
and diving teams ﬁnished off a successful

weekend; with a Saturday Syracuse sweep. ‘

The men’s team placed first in both
diving events with Beal winning the 1-
meter competition and Michael Wells win-
ning the 3-meter competition.

In swimming competition, the men
won all 11 events. Steve Siler led, with

wins in the 200—yard freestyle, the 200-
yard backstroke, and joined Raymond
Brush, Max von Bodungen, and Adam
Webber to place ﬁrst in the 400 medley
relay. ,

Sophomore Arda Kostem had an
impressive swim in the 200—yard breast
stroke where he placed ﬁrst and achieved a
personal best time. The 400-yard freestyle
relay team of Webber, Michael Demos,
Michael Hand and Miah Heath ended the
meet, with a slim .59 second win. ' ’

Knolles was very pleased with the
team’s perfonnance particularly because of
the tough practices and back—to-back meets
the swimmers had._ '

mented. “Our weight coach, Tim Beltz, has
been doing a great job kicking their butts.”

The women’s team won both diving
competitions and seven out of the 11
swimming events, led by O’Brien, who
took ﬁrst in both the 1—meter and 3-meter
diving competitions.

The women dominated as they won
the 400-yard medley relay and had a 1-2-3

‘ sweep in the 1650-yard freestyle, led by
junior Emily Colley. They also took the

first four places in the 50-yard freestyle.

Carolyne Savini had a very solid meet,
placing ﬁrst in the 200-yard IM, the 100-
yard freestyle, and joining her teammates
Redman, Kristina DeWitt and
Linvingstone to win‘ the 400-yard medley

relay and the 400-yard freestyle Relay, _ I

accomplished by Livingstone, Weaverling,
Sappey and Karen Thibodeau.

“Overall, our swimming is right on
track for this point in the season, and we
are looking to have a good away meet
against Rutgers,” said women’s coach

The team travels to Rutgers on Nov. 9.

the Yankees win every year, with the excep-

' tion of people in New York and all those“

who have become Yankee fans since 1996

(they’re the same people who became Bulls . _

fans in theearly 1990s). '
Other than those people, there are plen-
_ty of fans that would like to see another team
win a title.

Dispersing the Yankees’ players makes '

sense, not only to end their ‘dynasty, but to
also give teams like the Pirates or the Twins
a chance to pick up a player that they nor-
mally would have no chance of signing. 4
Can you imagine how much extra pop
the Pirates lineup would have with the addi-
tion of Vladimir Guerrero ‘or Bemie
Wﬂliarns? Or adding Javier Vazquez 0
Andy Pettitte to their rotation? ‘
It may not give the Pirates a chance at
making the playoifs any time soon, but con-

traction might push teams like the Phillies or‘

the A’ s to the next level.

It really doesn’t matter who contraction
helps, just as long as it keeps the Yankees
from winning another World Series.
