RSA mixer

The Pitt News

Avanti Johnson and Alisha Aponte each

consumed four drinks in a matter of min-

utes. '
They both stayed sober. _
Both freshmen attended the Resident

. Students‘ Association’s Non-Alcoholic
Mixer last night. The armual event provides V

students an- alternative to drinking alcohol.

‘ This is the third year RSA has spon-
sored the mixer, organized by Michele
Griffith, resident director of Schenley Quad

, and director of RSA.

‘This is something I started when I ﬁrst
came to Pitt,” Grifﬁth said.'She got the idea _

. when she worked for residence life at

California University of Pennsylvania while
studying for her master’s degree.

Each group, composed of resident
assistants or RSA members from each resi-
dence hall, ﬁlled out an application and
came up with a theme, mixed alcohol—free
drinks, and invented names for their concoc-

gives stude

‘From  p.m. to 9 p.m., the.Towers Patio‘
was the showcase for the themes, from a
“Fall Farm Fest” to a table of “Elegance.” In

one comer, a red and white tent was the

stage for a dancing “Freak Show,” where
characters including a bearded lady and a
human canvas strutted their stuff to music.

‘Scientists passed out a ‘Toxic Tonic,” a

secret blend that contained Oreos and J ell-O.
P ,- Meanwhile, representatives ' from
Student Health Servicesinfonned students
about the adverseaeffects of alcohol. Their
table was covered with pamphlets, key
chains, and infomiation on the hazards of
' “I thought Tower B was the best,”
Aponte said. That table served a non-alco-
holic “Sex on the Beach.’’, ' ‘ ‘

The drink at the Firemen’s table was a

big surprise.
“I started laughing,” Johnson admitted.
She couldn’t believe they were serving
water. ,
Johnson said that the mixer was a good

TRAVIS REAL
Staff Writer

As the semester starts so does the print-
er in the quiet but chaotic world of journal
publishing. Pitt and its various departments
publish joumals aimed at various audi-
ences.

Collision, the newest journal at Pitt, is
published by the Honors College. Carey
Smith is the journal’s ﬁrst editor in chief.

“Last spring a group of undergraduate
students decided to come together to share
our nonﬁction writing,” Smith said. “A
group ofus decided it was time to create a
nonﬁction journal, as Pitt has never had a
journal like this before.”

“We got the idea ﬁorn our title from the
fact that we envision dilferent forms of gen-
res colliding together with energy,” she said

It is Smith’s responsibility as editor in
chief to oversee meetings and go over ﬁnal
selections for publication. Jennifer Andrews
and Jennifer Lee serve as additional advis-
ers for the project

According to Smith, Collision’s inau-
gural issue, which was released last spring,
was very successful. The deadline for the
ﬁrst fall issue is Oct 10. Anyone interested
in submitting a nonﬁction memoir, essay,
photograph, piece of art or other forms of
nonﬁction should log in at the Collision

’ Web site at www.pitt.edu/~collide.

Reader is also a new journal on cam-

pus. Described as a collection of “essays in
reader-oriented theory, criticism and peda-
gogy,” various universities published it
twice a year for 25 years. Pitt faculty mem-
ber Mariolina Rizzi Salvatori received the
rights to publish Reader from Michigan
Technological University.

“The previous editor, Elizabeth Flynn,
asked Mariolina if she wanted to take over
publishing,” said Paul Kameen, a Pit facul-
ty member and an editor. “So the rights
were given to Pitt, practically for free, ﬁom
Michigan Tec .”

The ﬁrst issue of this biannual publica-

.tion came out last spring. According to

Kameen, there are great plans for this pub-
lication in the future.

Kameen also said that the fall issue will
have a special guest editor. '

"Ihe issue will be a special one dealing
with trouble in the classroom and how these
troubles might be resolv ” Karneen said.

One topic is the complexity teachers
face when teaching Shakespeare for those
students tmfamiliar with his works.

The fall issue is expected in December.
According to the Web site, Reader accepts
papers on many topics related to English,
including reading research, literature, gen-
der, ﬁlm and cultural studies.

Anyone interested in submitting works
maydo so at www.pitt.edu/~reader. There
is also an index for past issues and one can
purchase subscriptions on this Web page.

International Week combines
food, lectures and feng shui

J 0131 WEIGAND
Staff Writer

Displayed on the side of a ﬁling
cabinet beside a certain businessman’s
desk was a large poster of the sinking
Titanic.

Everyone who walked in his door
and stood in front of the desk could
clearly see the poster. The businessman
saw the poster every time he entered his
office.

One day the businessman called
Phil Jarmetta because he felt his career
was going down the drain.

Jarmetta, a professional feng shui
consultant, instantly diagnosed the
problem — the poster.

In a lecture he gave Wednesday as
part of International Week, J annetta told
this story in an effort to describe how
our surroundings affect our subcon-
scious.

He explained that feng shui, the
Chinese system that studies people’s

relationships to their living environment
in order to achieve maximum harmony,
is based on energy.

“The energy ﬂow in a space you
occupy affects you,” Janetta said. “It
inﬂuences your health and intellectual
stability.”

Jarmetta explained that feng shui is
also a way to recognize and remove
mismatched energy, like the Titanic
poster. 

He also mentioned that sleeping in
a bed directly in front of a doorway
could cause sleepless or restless nights
because there is a ﬂow of energy lead-

ing out the door.

In another anecdote, Jarmetta said
that a couple’s marriage was suffering
because the husband could only fall
asleep on the living room couch and not
in the bedroom. It turned out that he was
sleeping in the doorway’s energy path,
which was disrupting his sleep.

THE PITT NEWS

Mental health experts prescribehonesty

RYAN S. MCLIMANS'
Staff Writer _

Onthatday, it was asifarug was pulled
out from undemeath of America.

To help the ‘community cope with the
shock and anxiety people feel after tragic
events, UPMC Health System sponsored a
free presentation Wednesday night, titled
“Coping with Fear.” V '

Mental health, specialists Veronica
Yablowsky and Sue Wesner provided ways
for people to help their friends and family
overcome the trauma of the nation’s recent
disaster and retum to normalcy.

“When we saw the events unfold Sept.
11, our survival instincts of ‘ﬁght or ﬂight’
were activated,” said Yablowsky, a member
of the USAirways disaster team and an
employee assistance counselor. _

“We experienced an Adrenaline nrsh,”
she said “Our hearts raced to pump more
blood to feed our muscles with sugar, our

breathing became shallow and fast, as we.

stayed alert and scanned our environment
for immediate threat; seeking information
crucial to our survival.”

According to Yablowsky, ﬁght orﬂight
reaction can affect a person’s body for days,
even weeks, unless the hormones are
ﬂushed out of their system.

. Because the brain is searching for the
threat of danger and preoccupied. with sur-
vival, it consumes a lot of energy, making it

  

difﬁcult for a person to concentrate on daily
tasks and work.

This is an instinctual, emotional
response and carries symptoms that almost
all Americans felt after witnessing the

attacks. If people are having trouble re1eas- '

ing these symptoms and energies, counsel-
ing would be beneﬁcial, not to diagnose a
mental problem, but just to provide aid and
relief.

The problem with these recent
tragedies, according to experts, is that the
threat continues to occupy the thoughts of
many Americans. Because a resolution has
not been offered, there is no clear end to tell
people that it is over so that they can stop,

cope and move" on. That’s why the ﬁght or '

ﬂight response can be activated off and on
during this time, creating a roller coaster
effect in the body.

“Our muscles are anxious, waiting to
be physi ” Yablowsky said, ‘use exercise
to manage stress. A nice walk around ﬂre
block can very helpful in releasing these
tensions.” A

. Yablowsky recommended that people

'— try to consciously control their breathing if

they feel their hearts racing and their breath-
ing become shallow. If a person begins to
yawn or feel tired or nervous, they should

‘take deep breaths to slow themselves down.

Exercising, seeing a movie, household
chores and enjoying a family meal all aid
the release of tension brought on by these

from the disaster or pull them away from
their normal lives.

A “Be honest and provide children with
accurate information. Don’t let them create
their own information or realities of what
happened,” Wesner said “It’s OK to say ‘I
don’t know.”’

' The two-hour long presentation took
place in the Sheraton Station Square and
allowed  to share their concerns
and emotions, and to seek further help with
UPMC Presbyterian trauma specialists.

According to Wesner, everyone
responds ditferently to fear and chooses a
ditferent path to recovery. “We are not bet-

Student-atheist

starts club for

like—minded non-believers

LARA HUFFMAN
‘ Staff Writer

“Anopenmindis avir111e...butnotso
open that your brains fall out,” Charles
Darwin said.

This quote, and several others adorn
ﬂiers being distributed across campus, pro-
moting a new organization called the\
Campus Freethought Alliance. The Alliance
is a student group whose members consider
themselves atheists or “non-believers” in
religious dogma

Freshman Daniel Robison is in the
process of getting the University to recog-
nize his new organization. As soon as Pitt
accredits the organization, Robison can start
the process of getting the chapter recognized
by the international CFA.

According to Robison, ﬂiers haven’t
been posted for long, but many students

, already wish to participate. He also said that

it would be up to the group’s members
whether they involve themselves with any
type of activism.

According to the CFA’s official Web
site, the organization began in 1996. CFA is
sponsored by the Council for Secular
Hmnanism and is a nationwide and interna-
tional organization. The group would like to

promote scientiﬁc literacy, defend the teach-
ing of evolution, expose “pseudoscience”
and protect the separation of church and
state, among other issues.

Inthepast, CFAranacampaign called
“S.O.S.” standing for “Save Our Science”

and “Save Our Schools.” The campaign A

sought to prevent schools from teaching cre
ationism ‘
Robison would like to organize many
events for the CFA chapter, like a debate on
evolution vs. creationism between CFA and
a Christian group. Robison would like the
whole campus to be involved in the debate
and for it to be “fun, friendly and fair.”
“Our primary goal is not to convert

Christianity, Judaism or Islam to atheism,”.

Robison said.
, Another event Robison would like to
see happen is the celebration of Charles
Darwin’s birthday on Feb. 12. He would
also like to be on the lecture circuit so the
group can hear speakers lecture about topics
such as atheist philosophers or evolutionists.

CFA’s ﬁrst meeting is planned for some-
time in the next few weeks. .

Freethought Alliance, visit www.campus-
freethought.org or e-mail

Shooting at The 0 kills one

Shooting, page 1

According to the report, several units
later stopped two possible suspects on Fifth
Avenue, in front of Litchﬁeld Towers.

The report indicatedthat city police offi-
cers transported both of the possible suspects
and other witnesses to the investigations
branch of the Pittsburgh city police for ques- ,
tioning. t

S gt Timothy Westwood of the
Pittsburgh homicide department said the
case remains under investigation and that no
anests have been made. All of the witnesses
taken in for questioning were later released.

“That comer’s the epicenter of it all,’: V
Delaney said. “The rnini-station is in a good‘ '

place. It puts the oﬁicers where the action
is",

Sid Simon, owner of The 0, said neither
the alleged argument nor the actual shooting
took place inside the restaurant. Simon said

he believed that the ﬁght had started some- '

where further down Forbes.

Simon also pointed out that the restau-
rant hires oﬁ‘-duty police oﬂicers for extra
security. '

“It would never happen in here,” Simon
said “If it had happened in here, our_securi-
ty would have tossed them out.”V

Griﬁith and the “Freak Show” had a lot
to live up to. The Quad resident assistants
won four out of the ﬁve awards the ﬁrst year,
and three ﬁrst places last year. They took
ﬁrst place in Best Theme, Best Tasting, and

around, due to the fact he was wearing the
beer goggles offered by Student Health. The
goggles have warped lenses that simulate
what a drunken person sees. _

“The beer goggles are realistic to what
you face when you’re drunk,” he said.

The mixer is scheduled in conjunction
with National Alcohol Awareness Month.
“It’s a kickoff to National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week,” Grifﬁth said
“The mixer is an alternative to partying. 
You don’t have to drink to have a good
time.”

Spicing up a stressful week

If you’ve been to the library recently,
you’ve probably had a hard time ﬁnding a
quiet place to study. Why is Hillman prac-
tically bursting with diligent students? You
may already know the answer: Midtenns.

Its that time of the semester — the
joyous period when you try to balance
your job, social life, extracunicular activi-
ties and classes with exams that will deter-
mine as much as half of your grade.

The stress just might have you think-
ing about all the things you’d love to
change about the way the University han-

. dles midterms.

- _ The Pitt News would like to propose
the top 10 things (in no particular order)
we wish would change about rnidterms at
Pitt:

. 1. Pitt should designate an oﬂicial
midterm week. It would function similarly
to ﬁnals — basically the University world
should shut down so that students can
study for exams". As Pitt strives to look like
a classic university and achieve similar
prestige, an official week would put Pitt on
the same page as many other universities.

\V1th a week officially named, Pitt
should offer new services, and new stress-
relieving traditions should begin.

2. Student Government Board should

, provide coffee, cookies and milk — of

several different rnilk-fat percentages to
suit students’ diverse tastes — to students
in several locations. ‘

3. The library should stay open 24

hours a day during this week. It would also
be helpful if the Starbucks in the library

- extended its hours.

4. Students should follow other uni-
versities’ leads, and start some naked tradi-
tions, such as a naked library dash or naked
panther statue time.

5. In order to offer students moral sup-
port, Pitt should have cheerleaders, moms
and drill sergeants on hand to help moti-
vate students to study.

6. We propose a new event to be called
“Highlighter Gras.” SGB members should
gather students on the Cathedral lawn and
throw or use slingshots to distribute high-
lighters, pens, pencils, sticky-notes and
oﬂier fun supplies.

' 7. Professors should consider ways to
spice up the exam routine. We suggest
offering extra credit in English classes for
dressing up as characters in literature or
extra credit for extremely creative (albeit
wrong) answers, or for bringing the class a
midterm snack.

8. The University should institute a
policy to exempt birthday boys’ or girls

. from rnidterrns on their special day.

’ 9. An additional policy’ deﬁnitely
worth consideration would be one exam
waiver per semester, functioning like a
“get out of jail free” card in Monopoly.

10. And to conclude the effort-ﬁlled
week, the University should sponsor a
post-rnidterm feast and fair .a la the ﬁnal
scene of the movie “Grease.”

Columnist discovers new life
form: the nice guy  

I must confess something. I dis-
covered a new life form living within
the confines of Schenley Quad. It’s
not a South Oakland hissing cock-

roach, a football-sized Monongahela

River rat or mutated blob that rose
from The O’s deep fryer.

These creatures, though they may
shape-shift —— changing their faces,
bodies and names —. are what I term
“nice guys.” «

As a result, I decided to write this
column as a tribute to

good only for a door-hold and a
laugh. -

It’s simply that nice guys tran-
scend gender. They are males, yes,
but they are also princes and punk
rockers, poets and Pepsi-addicts. Just
as friendship can transcend differ-
ences in race, religion, sexual orien-
tation and taste in ‘80s cartoons, it
can also conquer the ultimate gap:
gender.

I know these are not earth-shat-
tering, brain-melting reve-

these anomalies. Nice
guys are a special kind of
animal, a subset of Homo
sapiens, who carry out
their lives among the rest
of us mere mortals.
These decent human
beings roam through

one they meet or even
recognize. They hold the

years, if memory serves.

no matter the person’s gender-, and

I have not referred to said subspecies

think of them as men.

And no, before anyone asks, I
haven’t mentally castrated a large

them into giant loveable eunuchs

Still, as the refrain
that “boys suck” and “girls are self-

decided something needed to be

(and, no, I’m not going to go on and on about
how much better Philly is — in general), I
spent my high school years agonizing over

Well, maybe I didn’t really go to clubs.
But I’m saying Pittsburgh would be much
better otf if Downtown was an oasis rather
than a wasteland So, I’ve come up with the
brilliant enterprise that will spark another
renaissance in Pittsburgh: mini—golf.

Not just regular mini-golf, mind you,
but a revolutionary approach to the sport of
the athletically impaired everywhere.
Imagine a renovated 18-story Downtown
building with each ﬂoor containing its own
elaborate course for one hole. Windmills,
sand traps and unnatnrally blue waterfalls
would abound. And, for the piece de resis-

talking about having crystal wineglasses for

I believe that once students, faculty,
families with small children and bored old
people start to attend my “Mini-golf
Emporium” on a regular basis, they will
begin to wonder why there is nothing else to
do for a three-rnile radius. And other mer-
chants, jealous of my generous proﬁts, will
react.

Soon we will have an expanded Harris

age-sized intro psychology class. A concert
hall will be next door for those of .us who
think the Post-Gazette Pavilion is a little far.
You will ﬁnd wild novelty stores for every
teenage stereotype, open until midnight on
the weekends. To support this, the “Mini-
golf Emporium” will have “Goth” and
“Hippie” nights, playing the best Cure
remixes or Phish albums that money can
buy. But remember, no smoking on the

Before you know it, Downtown
Pittsburgh will barely be ‘known for its day-

or a_ dance club a little more stylish than
Panama Jack’s, will appear and stay open
longer than three months. That is, if you’ll all
be kind of enough to give the “Mini—golf
Emporium” your business. '

It’s easy enough. Don’t go see
“American Pie 2” for the third time. Save
your brain cells and come play some stimu-
lating mini-golf. The Emporium should be
up and running soon —— just as soon as Iﬁnd

little something like this: Twang!

In fact, a friend of mine from Penn
State sent me a greeting card last week with-
out any motivation. I staredat the card with
awestruck amazement as if I’d just caught a
Barry Bonds homerun. It was justa note to
say “hi” and that she hoped things were
going well for me. I couldn’t recall the last
time I’d written or received an actual hand-
written note. I thought those subtle acts of
friendship were extinct. It’s a deeply fulﬁll-

Actually, it’s a tough little game to
resist, particularly when around every turn on campus
sits a computer lab and a few rows of e-mailkiosks.
Most of us find these to be an irresistible temptation.
AOL and its slicker counterpart AIM are so addictive
that we’re often more than willing to ﬁitter away hours
of free time chatting with friends about nothing.

It’s for this reason alone that the only addresses stu-
dents are exchanging these days have an @ sign in the

ing sensation when a friend goes to those
kinds of lengths.

Maybe I’m spoiled, but e-mail does nothing for me
anymore. I get about as much pleasure from checking
my e-mail as I do from watching back-to-back episodes
of “The View.” .

I find it boring and hastily written. Students stop
withten, maybe ﬁfteen minutes between classes and
hash out a letter using some of the most primitive gram-

mar known to man: Here’s a sample of what I can

expect to read: “Yo dood meat mee att schenley round ,

I’m told people are “ROTF.” I highly doubt you’re

reassuring chuckle from my mother.

Away messages are another story. There is one

basic type of away message. The user visits a site full,

of lyrics, then cuts and pastes a random quote and
leaves it on as his away message for everyone to pon-

L mocking Judaism is OK. Judaism is a

Article about Judaism offensive,

damages University image

I would like to respond to Ben Rubin’s
article, “Being Jewish blows a shofar.” As
a Jewish freshman who is active in a num-
ber of campus organizations, both reli-

gious and secular, I would like to say that I '

am severely offended. I think that I have a
fairly good sense of humor, but I recognize
that there are limits and boundaries.
Apparently Rubin does not. This article

was the most offensive, tasteless waste of .
~ ink that I have seen in a long time.

I recognize that this article was meant
to be a farce. I understand that I was

religion that has battled years of persecu-
tion that has been largely attributed to a
weak Jewish identity.

I ask you, and the rest of the staff:
What does the article do for Jewish identi-
ty? The fact that Rubin degrades one of the
holiest Jewish holidays (Rosh Hashanah)
is only mildly annoying compared to the
perpetuation of virtually all Jewish stereo-
types. Satire only goes so far.

The tastelessness of the author is only

superceded "by the offensiveness of the

individual that chose topublish this in the
paper. You would never publish an article
mocking sexual orientation -orrace; there-

fore, there is no reason that there should be
an article published that mocks a religion.
This article, though, diminishes any
credibility that the paper might have once
had.There are many important individuals
within , the Jewish community that are
benefactors to the University. I ask you
what will they think when they read this
article? What will a prospective parent of a
Jewish student say when they read, “One
pro is that all Jewish girls give good head”
This article has undoubtedly done
irreparable damage to the University. It is
unfathomable to me that this article would
actually appear in a major university’s

 

newspaper. This is The Pitt News, not The
Onion. I have discussed this article with
numerous students, both Jewish and non-
Jewish. The unanimous consensus is that
this article not only displays ignorance on
behalf of The Pitt News, it also displays
ignorance on behalf of the University to all
outsiders. I would just like to say that I am
oﬁended, and I am not alone. The Pitt
News has a reputation for printing funny
editorials, but this was not funny. I know
that the student body is shocked and angry.

supposed to laugh. What I don’t
understand is how someone could be
that tasteless to actuallywrite this arti-
cle and much less publish it.
Regardless of whether Rubin was try-
ing to be funny or satirical, the article
is inappropriate.

Judaism is a religion rich with
4,000 years of heritage and culture. It
islnot something that ought to be joked
about. Whether Rubin is Jewish or not
is irrelevant, the words that are on page
six are just as offensive as if they were
written by a skinhead. The article

Avoiding gender stereotypes, social norms

Bergman, page 5 .

hair-pulling,‘ I find little hope or
inspiration in today’s feminism.

As the division between the radi-
cal feminists and conformists widens,
I find that having a leg in both camps
will only land me on my ass. The for-
mer say the word men in a scomful
and .derisive tone and the latter are
too busy asking if they look fat in
these pants to address the issue.
There is a continual conﬂict between
the worlds of Donna Reed and
Scarlett O’Hara (who was in no ‘way
a wuss; for Christ’s sake, she killed a
man in Georgia just to watch him

bleed then took his money).

I subscribe to being neither a
murderous southern belle nor a perky
ornament. Instead, I am a realist. All
people are fundamentally equal in
their fundamental right to justice,
dignity and compassion.

My experience with nice guys
proves that there are those who
refuse, whether deliberately or
unconsciously, not fit into social
norms; that for every asshole, jerk-
off and future politician, there are
humans who choose to live their lives
differently.

In this fight between and within
the gender camps continues, I find

those who don’t adhere to stereo-
types, like nice guys and myself, left
high and" dry. Non-extremists are
stuck in this quagmire of misplaced
labels and misaimed assumptions. So
to all those people who are round
pegs to society’s square pigeonholes,
I say keep on rocking, because in at
least this co1umnist’s book, nice guys
finish first.

People may call me a hypocrite for
writing this column since I use AOL all
the time. Before you do, keep in mind
that I’m not saying we need to abolish
AOL and Instant Messages. My
renouncing the Instant Message would
be like Shaquille O’Neal leading a cru-
sade against the slam—dunk.

My point is that it wouldn’t hurt to
mix it up a little. Remember what it’s
like to physically write a letter or to lick
the backside of a stamp. Even the occa-
sional phone call from time to time is
worth footing the bill. And if you can
spare a minute, leave. Grab some friends
and wander around campus.

I say “fancied” because .

Grammy was fancy. She liked to dress up; she liked/to
pretend to be someone else. I used to thinkmy taste/s
were inﬂuenced by a particular set of friends I had, but ’
now that I think about it, I think my grandmother
helped foster my. love of dressing up, the whole idea of

pretending to be someone different. , .

She had a couple of characters she liked to/' slip
into. “Lola,” the beautician, was my favorite. She

would disappear into her bedroom and return, pow-

dered and perfumed, her hair messily swept up into a
scarf, red lipstick smeared on her lips. She would cart
out her portable salon-style hair ‘dryer, a truckload of
pink curlers, and a makeup kit. She answered only to
“Lola,” and would try to curl her granddaughters’ stub-
bornlyt straight hair. .

As part of her fanciful personality, my grandmoth-
er also designed and ‘collected dolls; perhaps she
thought of her granddaughters as living, .. breathing
extensions of the porcelain and ceramic dolls over
which she carefullylabored. ‘

Another of her characters, a mysterious queen clad

V in a purple velvet robe, appeared at a special dinner for

the women of her doll-making group’ and their grand-
daughters. Again, my sisters and I were perplexed by
her obstinacy at remaining in character and in ignoring
our calls of “Grammy.” She gracefully emceed the
entire event under a majestic disguise. , .

Last summer, I found a picture of her in
Washington, D.C. Taken in the early 1960s, her hair
was smoothed underneath a sunshine yellow chiffon
scarf and she shaded her eyes with glamorousblack
sunglasses. The gleaming white steps of the Capitol
stood in the background, and I can’t help but think she
might have been pretending to be Jackie O. at the
moment the flash went off. ‘

, She always encouraged my sisters and cousins to
dress up. Most of our outrageous dress-up clothes
came from her; we had several pairs of metallic and
gem-stoned high heels, millions of scarves that we

‘ originally scoffed at but actually wear today, and crazy

nightgowns that doubled as princess gowns for us.

Today, when I smooth on red lipstick or sit under '

the dryer at the hair salon, I think of her. When I shop
in a vintage store or get ridiculously dressed up for no
reason at all, I think of her. I was thinking of her today,
and that’s why I wrote this column. '

Tip-toeing around the towers

The entertainment

, industry reacts

BRIAN KLUCHUROSKY
' Staff Writer

It’s been said that “Hollywood couldn’t have
scripted it better,” but not even Tinseltown could
have envisioned the horriﬁc and tragic events of the
past weeks. Slowly, we are turning our attention
back to the industry that was ironically tossed out of
the spotlight at a time when the all of the world‘s
eyes were upon us. .

The entertainment industry is a mere after-
thought in the wake of these ungodly happenings,

but a thought nonetheless. Questions now exist

about the future of the entertainment business; what
defines bad taste, how have release schedules been
affected, and how can we ever look at the New York
City skyline the same way again? ‘

To even’ begin to look for answers, we must go
back about a month. Presidents and politics
remained the punch lines of late night monologues,
ﬁlms and television shows of all nature felt no topic
taboo and music about wanting to hurt an individ-
ual, either mentally or physically, received plenty of
airplay on radio stations. But all that’s changed.

Now, movies dealing with terrorism, such as
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s “Collateral Damage,”
due for a mid-September release, have been post-
poned indeﬁnitely. Shots of the World Trade Center
in other upcoming films have been taken out or
replaced. ~ . ,

According to www.comingattractions.com,
“Spiderman” is currently being reworked because
of a scene that contained a web between the twin
towers. “Men in Black 2” is not only busy re-shoot-
ing but also rewriting because the script called for
aliens that emerged and attacked from the WTC.
Even the opening credits of I-IBO’s “The Sopranos”
must be redone despite onl

rent thriller, “Don’t Say a Word.” In fact, this ﬁlm,
with a 5 second shot of the Manhattan skyline, may
be the last mainstream ﬂick ever made with a shot
of the twin towers still intact.

Certain songs have been under heavy debate for
airplay on radio stations, due in part to Clear
Charmel Communications’ release of a list of more
than 150 songs with metaphorical tie-ins that just
might hit a little too close to home. Some of these
songs include Steve Miller’s “Jet Airliner,”
R.E.M.’s “It’s the End of the World as We Know
It,” and the entire Rage Against the Machine cata-
logue. ,

Most recently, the Dave Matthews Band, who
already has a song on the list with “Crash Into Me,”
canceled the release of the next single off their
Everyday album titled, “When the World Ends.”
Want to guess why?

This is the most debated topic of all the media
in the entertainment industry, and many people
have spoken out, voicing why these songs should or
should not be pulled from radio stations.

“These songs are all from the past, so they sim-

ply aren’t related in any way to the attacks,” said

Dustin Henry, a senior at Pitt. “If they become
linked, it is because of the media, not the artist.
Let’s deal with the current situation at hand, not
make new ones.”

‘ Others feel very differently about censoring
certain songs. “These are sensitive times,” said
Chris Korey, also a senior at Pitt. “And even though
these songs aren’t directly about the attack on the
U.S., we should do everything to show respect to
the families of the lives lost. And some of these
songs are a constant reminder.”

Perhaps late night television shows have the
toughest task. After all, it has to be at least some-
what awkward jumping right back into crude, sar-
castic, and cynical humor. Talk show hosts Conan

.O’Brien and Dave Letterman seem to simply be

going through the motions, with their humor look-
ing forced. Can. you really’-b_lame them?

Of all the movies that really try for the laugh-a-minute effect, it’s
rare that any of them actually achieve it. Ben Stiller’s new comedy‘
“Zoolander” doesn’t quite make it either, but it’s pretty darn close.

The plot has something to do with a cadre of the world’s lead-
ing fashion designers who plot the assassination Prime Minister of
Malaysia for his stance against child labor. To do this, they must
brainwash a hapless male model, since, naturally, they are ideal
assassins — they can gain entry into any event or club, plus they’re
too dumb to object to manipulation anyway. _ _

Enter Derek Zoolander.

Zoolander (Stiller) has been the world’s leading male model
four years running, but lately he’s down on his luck. He lost VH1
Model of the Year Award to newcomer Hansel (the brilliant Owen
Wilson), the extreme—spor1ing, fashionable drug-takin , neo-hippie
straight out of a Calvin Klein ad who, according to designer Mugatu,
is “so hot right now.” From this, it’s clear toevil Jean Paul Gaultier-

, prototype Mugatu (Will Ferrell) that Zoolander is the man for he and
1 l his cohorts’ assassination ploy.
‘ At least that’s the set-up. But the ensuing ﬁlm is basically a loose
adventure-comedy romp through the fashion industry, with a hand-
ful of the best modem comedy stars ﬁlling in the roles. Stiller’s
directing keeps the ﬂow of comedic setpieces wound together tight-
ly enough that the ﬁlm isn’t continually halted by meandering

Scared speechless

Don't Say a Word ’
Directed by Gary Fleder

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
The Pitt News

Directed by Gary Fleder and based on
the book “Edgar” by Andrew Klavan,
“Don’t Say a Word” is the latest in the long
line of thrillers involving ordinary people
thrust into extraordinary circumstances. It is
far better than the rest, though, because of
strong performances, deep characters and a

. distinct visual style.

Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas),

art. music. film. thedtre. find more listings online. www.pil'lnews.com ‘

a successful New York psychiatrist, his wife
Aggie (Famke Janssen) and their daughter
Jessie (Skye Bartusiak) are thrown in the
middle of Patrick Koster’s (Sean Bean)
decade-long quest to_ reclaim a rare red dia-
mond. A ~
Koster and his gang kidnap Jessie and to

get her back, Dr. Conrad is forced to unlock

a code buried deep in thepsyche of a trou-
bled patient (Brittany Murphy). The code is
the key to discovering the whereabouts of
the diamond.

“Don’t Say A Word” stands out when
compared to other recent thrillers because of
the exceptional performances of Douglas,
Murphy and Oliver Platt, portraying Dr.
Louis Sachs, a colleague of Douglas’s Dr.
Conrad. The villains in the movie, from
Bean’s Koster down to the henchmen are
especially slimy and easy to root against

The onlyproblem with the movie is

Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer
Esposito). Although integral to the plot, her

0

 

character remains two—dimensional. She
seems only to be a plot device. '
The other characters are deep, three-

dimensional people populating a real world ‘

The movie would work with another cop in

her place, but Detective Cassidy could have A

beenasdeepasthe othercharalctersinthe
movie. ' . ~

The movie isdistinct from all recent
movies set in New York, because Fleder cap-
tures the gritty side of New York perfectly.
This hasn’t been achieved recently, and is a
nice change of pace ﬁom the slick, clean,
 New York of the 19903.

For anyone looking to ﬁnd the twin

towers in a current movie, wait for the last 30 —

minutes of “Don’t Say a Word.” They are
deep in the background on the left side of the
horizon. ‘

“Don’t Say a Word” is a very straight-
forward thriller with only one rnajor plot
twist. But the movie is fun to watch and
always engrossing.» ‘

Panthers prowl tow reDm

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Whether it’s David Priestley or Rod
Rutherford at’ the helm, ‘Pitt football
will be looking to bounce back after last
week’s 43-21 loss to the Miami
Hurricanes when it travels to South
Bend to play the Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame.

Notre Dame (0-3) will be looking
for its first win of the season when it
plays the Panthers (1-2, 0-1 Big East).
This is the ﬁrst time in school history
that the Irish started out 0-3. The three
losses were to college football power-
houses Nebraska, Michigan State and
Texas A&M.

Saturday’s game will be the 59th
meeting between the Panthers and the
Irish. The two schools have combined
to win 26 national championships, the
Irish winning 17 and the Panthers win-
ning nine. O

Notre Dame leads the all-time
series 40-17-1. Last time the two
schools met was Nov. 13, 1999, the last
game at Pitt Stadium, in which the
Panthers prevailed 37-27.

But the Panthers do not have histo-
ry on their side when it comes to play-
ing at Notre Dame. '

Pitt is 8-17 overall at Notre Dame.
The Panthers’ last visit to South Bend
wasNov. 16, 1996, which resulted in a
60-6 loss to the Irish.

The Panthers’ defense will be fac-
ing an experienced Irish backﬁeld in
seniors‘ Tony Fisher (31 carries, 168

yards, 1 touchdown) and Terrance_ 

Howard, with junior Julius Jones (28-
106) also running the ball.

Fisher is a 2001 Doak Walker can-
didate who averaged 4.6 yards per carry
last year and he is also a threat out of
the backﬁeld as he caught 12 passes last
season. Three of the passes he caught
went for touchdowns.

Pittsburgh’s defense only allowed
one player to rush for over 100 yards in
its last eight games.

The receiving core for Notre Dame
is experienced, including seniors David
Givens, Javin Hunter and Amaz Battle.
Givens caught nine balls for 91 yards
and Hunterrecorded 18 carries for 167
yards and a touchdown. Hunter is the
big play receiver for the Irish. He aver-
aged 19.7 yards per catch last season.

Pitt’s passing attack will be going
into the game ranked second in the Big
East with an average of 243.7 yards per
game.

ranked second in the conference in kick
returns, thanks to junior comerback

Other Panthers to look watch for in

this week’s game are Ramon Walker

Fighting Irish have an

if Notre Dameﬂisistacked  tradition.
From the “Notre Dame Victory March” to
the leprechaun to the Irish guard, Notre
Dame has a long and storied tradition of
greatness that maintained a plethora of
loyal fans for over 100 years.

The University of Notre Dame, known
across the country as the “Mecca of colle-
giate football,” has had a disappointing
year thus far, starting the season with an
abysmal 0-3 record. But this fails to over-
shadow the accomplishments of the foot-
ball program .

Founded in 1842 by a 28-year-old
French monk, Father Edward Sorin, N otre
Dame was one of only nine Catholic uni-
versities in the country.

A very selective institution, Notre.

Dame is one of only nine colleges in the
country to admit less than half of its under-
graduate applicants. Notre Dame also
boasts a 93 percent graduation rate that is
third in the nation, just behind Harvard,
Yale and Princeton.

The history of Notre Dame football
dates back to November 1887, when it lost
its ﬁrst game to the University of Michigan
in an informal 8-0 contest The Fighting
Irish did not pick up their ﬁrst victory until
more than a year later, when they defeated
the Harvard School of Chicago by a score
of 20-0. '

1 Notre Dame football began to ﬂourish
in the 1920s. Coached by football master-
mind and innovator Knute Rockne, the
Irish lost only 12 games over 13 seasons.
Rockne’s credits include inventing and

1 popularizing the forward pass, as well as

designing Notre Dame stadium.
Thirty-seven years after that ﬁrst

Since the inception of the Associated
Press poll in 1936 as a method of ranking
college football teams, Notre Dame won
eight national championships, as well as
three consensus titles prior to the start of the
AP poll. 0

An independent team, Notre Dame’s
schedule often ranks among the most difﬁ-
cult in all of college football. Notre Dame’s

won by any other school.

No other school boasts more winners.

Notre Dame. ‘Seven different Irish players
have won the trophy, the most recent being
Oakland Raiders star wide receiver Tim
Brown, who won it in 1987.

Other Irish players to have one the
Heisman are Angelo Bertelli, John Lujack,
Leon Hart, John Lattner, Paul Homung and
John Huarte.

For many years, Notre Dame’s athletic
policies did not allow the football team to
participate in bowl games. The policy was
not amended until 1969. Since then, it has
played in bowl games in 23 of ‘the last 32
years and has a 13-11 record in such games.

Currently,’ there are more than 40 for-
mer Notre Dame players on NFL active
rosters. Among them is Pittsburgh Steelers’
halfback Jerome Bettis. Other famous
N otre Dame alumni include Joe Montana,
Joe Theismann and Steelers great Rocky
Bleier. _

meeting between the Panthers and the Irish
since the 1999 season. In that game, Pitt
bested Notre Dame 37-27, in the ﬁnal game

No reason not to give
Rutherford a shot

/

I feel the obvious choice for
quarterback has to be Rod
Rutherford.

While I’m sure he will make
mistakes just as Priestley has, this
can serve as valuable experience
for Rod and help him develop into a
top quarterback in the years to
come.

Priestley, on the other hand, has
already been given ample time to
prove himself and has done .little to
help the team during his Pitt career.
He will be gone afterthis season
and letting him play simply because
he is a senior is setting thevprogram
back another year. —

_ Maybe Rod’s athleticism is_ just
the spark that the Panthers need.
The rewards far outweigh the risks.

In Rod we trust!

Donnie Knight
CAS Junior

Priestley should not be
judged for Miami,
performance

You don’t base a decision to

dump your No. 1 quarterback on »

his performance against the No. _l
team in the country.

Let’s not forget there is a rea-
son they are the No. lranked team
in the country. The No. 1 team in
the country differentiates itself
from Pitt in a number of ways: bet-
ter coaching, better players and
most importantly, immeasurably
superior recruiting.

When the other team’s defen-
sive line dominates our offensive
line, and its secondary dominates
our wide receivers and our coaches

refuse to throw the deep ball
against the Miami safeties, there is
little doubt that our quarterback
will not have a good day.

Coach Harris’ decision to
replace David Priestly mid—game
was a costly error in judgment. In
back—to-back games, Harris deﬂat-
ed the confidence of his starter by
replacing him. It is essential that a
quarterback have confidence in his
own ability, but even more neces-
sary that he has confidence in his
coaching staff.

When David Priestly was
given the opportunity to throwthe
ball he proved he was up to the

‘task. Anyone that attended the

South Florida game witnessed
Priestly rise to the ‘challenge in the
second half. .

‘ The coaching staff ran plays
that bought Priestly time and gave
him the opportunity to put the ball

_ in the air. Our starting quarterback

demonstrated his ability to throw

' for yards and put points up on the

board.

I haven’t ‘seen enough of
Rutherford to fairly evaluate his
play. The few opportunities I had
to see his play reminded me of
another Pittsburgh quarterback,‘
Kordell Stewart. Not a favorable»
comparison.

Miami is not a fair measuring
stick. If we were to make decisions
based on the play against Miami,
all starters would need to be
replaced, with the exception of
Cox returning kicks and Raymond
Kirkley running the ball. Most
importantly, we’d be searching for
a new head coach.

I think this clarifies my point_.

Priestly is our man against
Notre Dame! '

West Virginia looks to
upset Virginia Tech

Big East, page 12

266 yards and three touchdowns. _

The Hurricanes defense has only
allowed 279 rushing yards and came up
with four interceptions.

No. 8 Virginia Tech (4-0 Overall, 1-
.0 Big East) vs. West Virginia (2-2
Overall, 1-0 Big East)

Virginia Tech visits West Virginia

after a 46-14 win over Central Florida.-

Both teams have each played one Big East
Conference game and both are 1-0 in the
conference.

With their victory last weekend over
Central Florida, the Hokies continued their
undefeated season with a record of 4-0.

West Virginia, suffered a 32-20 loss to

Maryland last weekend dropping its
record to 2-2.
Virginia Tech has a strong running game
and some depth at ninning back, which
allows it to rotate two rlmning backs and
still gain over 100 yards per game.
Rumiing backs Kevin “Jones and Keith
Burnell have combined for 605 yards
rushing yards and seven touchdowns ﬂiis
season. A

Against Central Florida the duo com-
bined for 172 yards and three touchdowns.

Quarterback Grant Noel is another -

key player who must ﬁll Michael V1ck’s
shoes. Vick now plays for the Atlanta
Falcons.

Noel has been successful so far,
throwing for eight touchdowns. He has not
thrown an interception this season.

Running back Avon Coboume leads
West Virginia.. Cobourne has rushed for
544 yards on’ 120 attempts and has four
touchdowns.

At quarterback for the Mountaineers
will be Brad Lewis. Lewis struggled
against Maryland last week as he was
intercepted four times.

Lewis’s favorite target is Antonio
Brown who has 19 receptions for 228

yards and a touchdown.

The Mountaineer defense is anchored A

by comerback Rick Sherrod and line-
backer Kyle Kayden. Sherrod leads the
team in" tackles with 62 and Kayden is the
tearn’s second leading tackler with 60. A

Both Sherrod and Kayden have one of
West Virginia’s three interceptions on the
season. -
Virginia Tech won last years contest 48-
20.

Boston College (3-1 Overall, 1-0 Big
East) vs. Temple (1-2, 0-0 Big East)

Temple goes into Boston College this .

weekend, where it has been winless since
1990.

Temple comes oﬂ a bye week, fol-
lowing a 42-23 loss to Bowling Green;
while the Eagles enjoyed a 31-10 win over
Anny last weekend. -

Temple features Mike McGann at

quarterback. McGann completed 23 of 46 '

passes for 276 yards and three intercep-
tions before taking a seat in the loss to
Bowling Green. _

VV1de receivers Zamir Abdu Cobb and
Sean Dillard are McGarm’s top two
options. Both receivers have 12 receptions
on the season. Cobb has 102 yards and a

touchdown and Dillard’s receptions‘

amount to 217 yards.

Temp1e’s defense will have its hands
full with Boston College nmning back
William Green, who is the Big East’s lead-
ing rusher. Green got off to a slow start
against Army last weekend, but picked it
up in the fourth quarter, to ﬁnish with 115
yards rushing. _

-Temple’s other concern will be the trio

of Eagles’ quarterback Brian St. Pierre and A

wide receivers Dedrick Dewalt and Ryan
Read. DeWalt is the Eagles” leading
receiver with 18 receptions for 227 yards
and two touchdowns. Read has 11 recep-
tions for 144 yards and three touchdowns.

Boston College won 31-3 in the two
teams’ last meeting.
