When he speaks, Dr. Al Condeluci speaks
with his entire body ——he paces in front of his
audience, he gestures with his hands, and he
looks his listeners in the eye.

This energetic professor and CEO.of United
Cerebral Palsy of Pittsburgh is therefore not a
surprising speaker to address the School of
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. V ._

Condeluci spoke yesterday at the SHRS’

_ Welcome Celebration , 2000. The Welcome‘
Celebration is a one-day extravaganza designed‘

to promote unity within the multi—disciplined

school. " , . _
In the past, some students have admitted that ‘

because SHRS offers seven different courses of

,. study, a sense of unity among the students is dif-

ficult to achieve. « _
Cliff Brubaker, dean of SHRS, explained that
results from_ a survey last spring indicated, that

while students felt “a sense of school,” they '

expressed a greater desire for a sense of commu-
nity. ‘ , ‘ C X
“Their identification is mostly with their own
profession,” Brubaker said. » V
Armed with this information, the student
advisory board of SHRS. organized this year’s

Welcome Celebration.
“It’s very important to us that this is a student
event,” Brubaker said. .
-While the celebration was a student effort,

.the advisory board worked closely with

Condeluci to develop programs and events that
would encourage a sense of community.

In addition to Condeluci’s speech, the day
also included six displays and demonstrations
and two “break—out” workshop sessions.

The displays featured technology developed
and used by students within the school and show-
cased technology’s importance and relevance to
the health and rehabilitation sciences.

Graduate student Sean Reeves demonstrated
“Game Wheels,” an interaetive computer-wheel-
chair training exercise. ’ _ '

The central idea behind “Game Wheels” is to
train people to use a wheelchair in a familiar
enviromnent. The wheelchair acts as a joystick to

A a computer game, and the person sitting in the

wheelchair interacts with a car—racing computer
‘game to learn howto effectively steer the chair.
‘Reeves suggested that the chair could also be
used to help wheelchair-bound individuals exer-

Habitat nails it

- JUSTIN MCCLELLAND

The Pitt News

This week the Pitt chapter of Habitat for Humanity is
hoping a hammer, some nails and a simple bedsheet will be
enough to build an entire house. _ V

Habitat for Humanity, an international non-profit orga-
nization that provides affordable housing for low-income
families, is sponsoring a nail driving contest and a fund-
raising competition‘ between Pitt and Penn State students
this week. The events serve as just two of several ways
Habitat hopes to raise $50,000 this year. The moneylwill be
used to build a home for a needy family in Pittsburgh’s Hill
District. \

The nail driving competition was the brainchild of
Habitat for Humanity president Chris Meaner, who was
looking for a unique way to raise money and spread ‘cam-
pus awareness of the organization. ~

The competition is held, outside of the William Pitt ‘

Union every day this week from 11 a.m. to-4  Students
pay $1 to try to hammer a nail into a board in-Va single

fle tickets for a drawing. to be held at the end of the week.

The new dating game

BRENTIN MOCK
The Pitt News

You won’t ﬁnd this “Dating Game”
on the Game Show Network. A

“We gonna do this ghetto style!”
announced host Barry Wilkins, chair of
programming for the Black Action
Society who sponsored this “Dating

Game.”

The Monday night‘ event kicked, off
the first ever black Homecoming celebra-

‘tion at Pitt. A

The original plan was to call contes-
tants from the audience who all received
a numbered ticket upon entrance to the
show. A bashful crowd‘ of students,
though, too shy to claim their numbers,
quickly changed that plan. '

Instead of using the raffle-ticket.

method, Wilkins just asked the crowd if
anyone wanted to come up on the stage to
participate. Hands didn’t exactly rush to

the sky, but six men and six women were A

snatched out of A the audience.

Three giggling girls graced the stage
as a wall was placed up to hide the mys-
tery man from his date candidates, who
the audience could see. . l

The male prospect, blind to his date
choices, asked three questions to see who
could produce the most enticing answers.
The same situation applied in each game.

Two. of the rounds featured a female
prospect wooing male-candidates for their
best answers. A

Contestants’ performances ranged
from freaky night club moves to cheesy
snip teases. Some guys broke out in song
with desperate hopes of winning the
chance to be courted by the woman wait-
ing behind the wall. . , .

Some girls shook their rumps to “The
Thong Song” and performed steamy

tricks with their tongues to increase their

chances of winning.

At one point the predominantly
female crowd was asked by co-host
Margarita Sanniento if they would like to
see a group of male contestants take their

clothes off. In what was likely a blow to A
A the male egos on stage, ’a unanimous
“No !” erupted from the ladies. Deaf to the '

response, the guys stripped down any-
Way. ' V A .A A

" As spontaneous and improvised as
the night was, the hundred or so students
who ﬁled in to the auditorium of the
Public Health Administration building for
the event Monday night certainly sound-
ed entertained. —-

The volume of the crowd’s cheers
decided the winner for each of the four
rounds; Wnuiing couples received a free
dinner, tickets to the upcoming
Homecoming ball and tickets to see rap-
per Rah Digga perform Sunday. A

stage by the karaoke disc jockey to
show her ﬁne voice and eventually
she learned to love it. I

» She has good reason to like the .
crowd. It’s diverse andfriendly, mostly _

regulars and some first-timers. Older
neighborhood couples mix‘ easily with
young punk rockers. Some come to
sing and carry on. Others come just to

kick back a few beers, eat some great,

bar food and watch the" show. It’s an
accepting crowd, and according to
Boyce, that’s part of what makes it spe-
cial. 1 .
“There are more characters at
kmaoke than anywhere else,” said a
guy everyone calls “Noach.” Noach

and Boyce havebeen friends for years
and he’s a regular on Sundaynights. _

He comes out to ﬁght off boredom and
would rather sing than watch television

‘or “just sit around drinking.” ,

A Noach is just one of the many char-

nights. There’s one young man with

' tattoos and adark goatee who smooth-

ly sings an old ‘Lou Rawls song “for the

I, ladies,” and :there’s always ,a- karaoke

“virgin” who sings for the.-first time.
Both are warmly _ received by the
crowd. Then the buzz grows louder

when Boyce calls out the name of the

next singer. — -
_ .“Spaz” takes the stage as his
5‘goth” posse hoots andhollers. With

his c1ose—cropped blue hair and his.

spiked dog collar, he is the unofficial
ringleader, of a group of punks that
make karaoke a weekly ritual.

Spaz shimmies and grinds as he
sings mostly ‘80s music with a delivery
‘that’s part mockery and part reverence.
Sometimes he’ll talk his way through
the instrumentalbreaks, deconstructing
-what he considersto be themeaning of
the lyrics. Sometimes_he’l1 make up his
own hilarious .wor’ds§ If you’re ‘lucky,
he’ll lead a conga,-.r'linel that ‘snakes its

way through tl}1etables.and7”c’liairs like a .

punk-rock python.

“What’s real Isay is real,”
says Spaz when asked about his ‘‘real’’
name. “I re-created myself as ‘Spaz.’
-That’s what I like to be called,” he said.
"He doesn’t ever use his real name.

Spaz has been doing karaoke for
two years and says he was immediate-
ly addicted after his first time in ‘front
of the mic. He persuaded some of his
punk and goth friends tojoin him, and
though they were skeptical at first, they
eventually caught on. V I _

_ He does his act for the goofy fun of
performing, but also uses his time on
the stage to make an, ironic point, or to
parody an artist or song. Popular with
the ‘crowd, Spaz may do four or ﬁve
songsa night. 0

P If you want to sing, go early and be I

sure to sign up. According to Boyce, an
average night at Ryan’s will feature 30
,to 50 singers. You can choose from
more than 6,000 songsto try, and the
show starts at 9:30 p.m.

Daily Pennsylvanian

(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA - Chanting
“two-four-six-eight, Dr. Laura teaches hate!”
and bearing signs with such slogans as
“Doctors help, not hurt,” nearly 70
Philadelphia-area gay rights activists con-
vened upon Independence Mall’ last night to

protest this week’s arrival of Laura

Schlesinger’s syndicated talk show to the
program lineup at CBS aﬁiliate KYW.

Schlesinger — whose new show is ded-
icated to dispensing “morals, values, princi-
ples and ethics,” according to her Web site
— has been the target of extensive criticism
for her ultra-conservative social views. V

In the past, she has been quoted refer-
ring to homosexuals as “biological errors”
and “deviants,” according to another Web
site, wwwstopdrlaura-.com

Yestcrday’s protest was organized by

the Center for Lesbian and GayVCivil Rights _

as part of a national movement with the pur-
pose of reminding Philadelphians, KYW
management and show sponsors just how
hateful Schlcsinger’s rhetoric is, according

-, to Tiffany Palmer of the CLGCR

Protestors ﬁrst assembled at Welcome
Park at Second and Walnut streets and then
marched over to the Independence Mall site,

all the -while chanting and  the attcn— ,

tion of rush-hour city commuters.

T I Ahandful ofspeakers then addressed
the crowd of ‘activists for nearly a half an

hour with speeches on the danger of — social
bigotry and prejudice, as well as the need to

’ drive Schlesinger off the airways of KYW.

Both KYW and the show’s distributor,

  Penn protests show

Paramount Television, olfered statements in
response to the criticisms raised by the pro-
testors both here in Philadelphia and 26 other
cities across the nation.

_ “Paramount Television recognizes
every individual’s right to have and express
his or her point of view,” said the statement
issued by Paramount “\V1th the production
of  Lau1a’s television show  we are
committed to presenting society’s moral and
ethical issues without creating or contribut-

ing to an environment of hurt, hate or intol- , A

erance.”

KYW’s statement echoed very similar
sentiments. .

“While we understand [the protesters’]

position, we are contractually obligated to

air the show,” it read. “Paramount has
assured us that the program’s content will

‘notbediscn'minatorytoanygroup.KYW

will also monitor the program to make sure

that it does "not promote discrimination g

against any group in our community.”

“If Dr. Laura had been speaking out
against blacks, Asians orobese people, it
would be called discn'm'_ination. and she
wouldn’t be on the air,” said Philadelphia
resident and
“Regardless of how people discriminate, it
still has an ugly face and I think it’s impor-
tantthat we stand up for our rights.” .

‘One of the demonstrators inppanicular _

took, a very unorthodox approach to the
Schlesinger criticism. '
“She just looks like an old Joan Rivers
with all the steam and none of the fun,” Rev.
Jim Littrell of the St; Mary’s Episcopal
Church said. “[While watching her on TV] it

struck me that Laura could  fashion

lessons from Larry King.” I

MICHELLE SHOEMAKER
The Pitt News '-

More than $200,000 was awarded

Provost’s Advisory Council on
Instructional Excellence for the
Innovation in Education contest. \

According to Vice Provost for

1 Faculty Affairs Andrew Blair, who

James Maher, tho ACIE was interested
in funding unique, innovative ideas that
promoted excellence in teaching. -
Blair said the council was interest-
ed in projects that worked to create a
notable improvement in curriculum, or
those that enabled faculty members

from different departments‘ to work.

together to form ideas.

Faculty from all ﬁve Pitt campuses
were invited to, participate in the con-
test. Individual submissions as well as

cooperative efforts were welcome.
According to Blair, the ACIE

all’ disciplines. Grants ranging from
$3,304 to $27,647 were awarded to the
15 projects that the ACIE decided
would enhance curriculum the most. _
Blair said that although , the

‘ University is highly acclaimed in the

The ACIE was founded in 1998 by
Maher and is dedicated to furthering

EDITORIAL

Penn State head football coach

Joe Patemo thinks he is above every-
one else. Although this may be true as
far as years he has been on this earth,
it is not true in other areas. Patemo is
especially not above everybody else
in dealing with video exchanges and

ending the Pitt-Penn State rivalry.
Over the summer, the Big East
Conference, of which Pitt is a mem-

ber, and the Big Ten Conference, of

which Penn State is the 11th school,
agreed not to bother exchanging tapes
of summer practices when their
schools play each other. Joe Patemo
does not‘ seem to think that this

-applies to him, complaining in a press

conference yesterday about Pitt’s fail-
ure to send videos of its summer prac-
tices this year. Meanwhile, Walt
Harris stated the truth — Pitt and
Penn State did not have to exchange
tapes.
Why is Joe Patemo above every-
body else? '

As everyone knows, this is the
last year — at least until 2008 — that
Pitt and Penn State will play each
other in football. Why? Because Pitt
will not and should not agree to
Patemo’s conditions. for continuing
the rivalry. These conditions include
the Panthers playing two games at
Beaver Stadium for every game that
Penn State plays in Pittsburgh. No
other school with which athletic
director Steve Pederson has signed a

JoePa is not higher than us

deal to play has tried to pull that, and
he has snagged some big-name
schools, like Nebraska, Texas A&M
and Michigan State. Pitt will play
each of these schools in a one-and-
one series.

Why shouldn’t Penn State be
among those schools? As Post-
Gazette columnist Ron Cook put it,
it’s not a matter of Pitt’s interests vs.
Penn State’s on this issue, but rather
Pitt vs. Patemo. Pitt and Penn State
operate on the same plan for all other
sports except football. This rivalry
draws in more students than any other

' Pitt matchup.' Saturday’s game will

only be the third Pitt has sold out in
the last 10 -years (one of the other two
was against Penn State), while Beaver
Stadium sells out almost every game.

Once again, why is Joe Paterno
above everybody else?

This Saturday will mark the 96th
occasion on which Pitt and Penn State

‘ have played each other in football;

this rivalry, dating back to 1893, is
one of the oldest in college football
and ranks up there with such great
regional rivalries as Harvard-Yale,
Texas—Texas A&M and Michigan-
Ohio State. And now it is coming to
an end, all because of Joe Patemo.

One ﬁnal time: why is Joe
Patemo ‘above everybody else?
Besides, we should be the ones mak-
ing demands, considering we didn’t
lose at home -to Toledo.

In most election seasons we always hear

Cracking down corporat   e crime

much talk about cutting down on crime — per— ‘

haps we’ll hear the same thing this year, despite
the decade-long decline in crime. One thing we
can be sure of, though, is that such discussion will
focus on property and violent crimes committed
by isolated individuals. While rape, burglary,
fraud and manslaughter all deserve public con-
demnation, the atrocity of corporate ‘
crime is often overlooked. The prin-
ciple of “do the crime, do the time”
is ignored in these cases and a slap
onthe wrist—asmallﬁne—is
typically the only punishment _
Such punishment allows corporate criminals
to roam free and strike again, withwidespread
recidivism- For instance, Exxon, Royal
Caribbean, Teledyne and United Technologies
were all repeat criminal offenders in the past
decade. While many Americans believe in “three
strikes and you’re out,’-’ these corporations can
keep striking without a single jail sentence for
their management. .
Not. only do these criminals avoid doing
time, but they clutter our airwaves telling us about
what good tlrey’ve done. Imagine O.J. Simpson

THE Prrr News

l _ Castaways on her show as well.

A “Survivor” addiction

Hi, my name is Erin, and I’m a
Survivoraholic. I I
Sure, it’s a little embarrassing to
admit that I called off work on
Wednesday nights, screamed at the
television incessantly, ordered sou-

‘ Venirs from the online store. OK, fine

—— it’s very embarrassing. Instead of
wallowing in that, however, I have

‘decided to take pride in my addic-

tion.

The theme of the CBS Shit.
“Survivor” was “outwit, outplay, out-
last.” That slogan may have been
designed to motivate the

V show’s 16 Castaways, but it _ Egggg:
ended up being just the pep  ‘ 

talk CBS needed. The net-
work chose trustworthy par-
ticipants who outwitted
viewers by maintaining utmost secre-
cy about the winner’s identity. The
network defeated the notion that the
Super Bowl was the only reason to
have a party in front of the television.

And the summer-long phenomenon.

outlasted everyone’s expectations.
' I was not as animated about the
show at first. My best friend and I

i had talked about it, but didn’t catch
the first episode. Afterward, we heard ,

the hype, caved. in and sat through the

' second” episode. Although we recog-
. nized its cliche, superficial “Real
_ World” quality, wewatched the third

week too. a . ~ -
It was all downhill from there.
Every week became a ritual;-we got

“sucked in just like everyone else.
. 1Watching- the show was similar to’
‘ those high‘ school fights where’ ‘every-

one had to get up and see who was
duking‘ it out and why. My living
room _housed only the two of us at

_ first, but the audience eventually

grew to -include my mom and
boyfriend as-well. Often lengthy,
heated discussions ensued. at work
the next day. I even got my Mary Kay

representative to watch the final
' episode. - '

Other networks -and shows “could.
not resist alluding’ to “Survivor”

. either. Comedy Central’s “The Daily

Show” poked fun at “Survivor” for
an entireepisode. Periodically, David
Letterman had each kicked-off cast-
away on “Late Night” and then the
invited the whole group on stage

7 after the final episode. Rosie

O’Donnell interviewed her favorite

Other companies hav'e also real-

if izedthe castaways’ impact and prof-

itability, offering them opportunities
to bask in the spotlight again. Jenna

‘turned down a spot in Playboy, Rich
_‘appeared .at the MTV Video Music
0 Awards and it is "rumored that Sean

was offered a morning show co-host‘
position. Thefinal four survivors .+

‘Sue, Rudy, Kelly and Rich — also

  

shot a “Got Milk?” ad. . ’
Considering the show’s unex-
pected popularity, l’ve been analyz-

- ing its appeal in comparison to the

now downplayed success of MTV’s
similar concept, “The Real World.”
The two tribes of Castaways on
“Survivor” may have attract_ed a
more eclectic range of viewers based
on age, occupation and interest. The
Tagi tribe potentially drew support
from truck drivers, homosexuals,
senior citizens, military men, credit
card frauds and religious folk from
I around the ' world.
Bagong, on the other
hand, most likely brought
in a more conventional
crop of viewers — stu-
. dents, doctors, teachers
and athletes. “The Real World,” how-
ever,‘ deals only with young adults,
which may limit its appeal. I

The whole premise» of the show

could have acted as a vicarious

adventure that viewers could experi-
ence from their couches..Unlike “The
Real World,” “Survivor” wasn’t just

a bunch of kids living in a cool house.

in a popular city who either fought or
slept with each other. The -survivors
were stuck on a South Pacific island,
competing, in exciting challenges on
every episode to avoid beingkicked
out of the game. - ' T .

The lure for me was simply the
fact that they were. real people going
through a real struggle. They were in
a strange place without‘ the comforts
of home. They suffered through star-
vation, cuts, bruises and bug bites.
They endured intense heat and sting-
ing rain +— all for the chance at $1.
million. It was intended to be a com-
petition for money, but it ended up
being a test of friendships, complete
with lies, conflict and revenge. As I
watched, I Wondered what I would
have done in that same situation or if

I could have lasted as long as they ’

did. That was the captivating angle of
the show. ,

Viewer feedback‘ sent CBS back
to the drawing board to create a sec-
ond “Survivor” in the Australian out-
back, which will premiere in January.

I assure you I will watch the first

episode this time, although I question

if the sequel can live up to the origi- .

nal V . V
So I admit it —— I had a

' “Survivor” party. We all bought pints

of ice cream, we yelled at Sue and we
ﬂipped out when Kelly didn’t win.
But life goes on  at least until the
new series begins. .

Look for Erin Brachlow in the front
row on Monday night when Sue is
speaking at the Union. She will be
wearing a sarong and toting a large
bowl of tapioca to throw at the stage.

Arizona State on Sunday.

Pitt 2, Arizona 1 (OT)

The Panthers trailed 1-0 for most
of the Arizona matchup as Naomi
Chu scored her first collegiate goal
for the Wildcats in the 17th minute.

But Pitt played tough and at the
73:38 mark of the second half, Laura
Marsh tied it for the Panthers on her
first collegiate goal. It was an unas-
sisted goal as Marsh picked up a
loose ball in front of the Arizona net
and slipped it past Wildcats goal-
keeper Shannon Monti. 1

Last.season, Gonsales was oﬂi to and

outstanding: start when he was sidelined
with a knee injury in the game .against
Temple. He then missec_l the. next three
games and saw ‘action-"in the
games against Virginia Tech and Miami
before returning to the; starting lineup.
Despite missinga considerable arnount of
time-, Gonsales -ﬁnished the season with
67 tackles, 36 of them solo, for fourth
place on the team. .

‘ The highlight of Gonsales’ seaso

was his effort in the near-upset of rival
Penn State. He picked up 20 tackles as the

has certainly not gone unnoticed, as he
has emerged as one of the key players on

just 65 rushing yards, and Gonsales was

named the Big East defensive player of,
- j the week. He was also instrumental in the
_’ Panthers,’ upset of Notre Dame, ‘as he p

recorded nine tackles to close out

“-‘My greatest football memory is def-
initely the last game, when we beat Notre
Dame,” Gonsales said.

In regards-to the injury, I nsales has-

put it behind him and worked hard in the
off—season. He has shown no symptoms
and seems to be back at 100 percent, a
place the Panthers definitely need him to
be. .
“He went through spring practice
with no ill effects,” said linebacker coach

David Blackwell. “He was solid in camp _

and hadareally‘gso1id'ﬁrst game.”
, Gonsales has been wearing, football

apads,'.for as long as he can remember, as he
grew up with two uncles who were both

football coaches. and consequently got
him involved in the game.

_ At St. Joseph’s High School in
Saddle Brook, he was a versatile player,
seeing time as a tight end and wide receiv-
er in addition to linebacker. Asa junior, he
was named ﬁrst team All-State and All-
County. As a senior, he led the team with
98 tackles and added two interceptions. '

Gonsales was again named to the first
team A1l—State and‘ added All-Suburban
honors and was ranked as one of the top
100 football players in New Jersey.

But Gonsales is by no means a one-
sport guy. When he’s not on the gridiron,
he loves to both watch and play basket-
ball. He also enjoys going to concerts but
manages to find time for studying as a

' communications major, although he is

unsure about his future.
“I’m just like your typical college stu-
dent,” Gonsales said. --
. Gonsales is anything but typical on
the ﬁeld. . ~
, With his combination of size, aggres-

sion and instinct, he has established him- ~ ,

self as one of the top defensive players on
the team and in the conference. He has
alsobeen named to the “watch list” for the
Butkus Award, which is annually awarded

, to the nation’s top linebacker.

But that is just an extra to Gonsales,
who said that simply playing football at
the Division I level is the greatest accom-
plishment of his career. He is excited
about the opportunity to play this season’s
home games at Three Rivers Stadium,
commenting that it is full of great memo-
ries and “has a great sound system.”

And while he has greatly impressed
Blackwell,‘ who is in his ﬁrst year of
coaching at Pitt, there is always room for
improvement. -

“I would like to see him assume more
of a leadership role,” Blackwell said. “He
is an effort guy and has great football
instincts. I hope he will continue to play
with that eﬁort and improve overall.”

The Panther defense will look to
Gonsales to lead the team, but Gonsales
prefers to keep his long-term goals sim-
ple.

“I just want to take it one game at a
time and get victories,” Gonsales said.

The Pitt News‘

You would think a team that could
produce 443 yards of offense in a sin-
gle game would have no problem

' putting up some phenomenal scores
during the course of a season. .

This is not the case for Temple, a
team that did put up such numbers and
yet only managed to put .10 points on
the scoreboard Saturday.

Even more disturbing to head’

coach Bobby Wallace are the statistics

they put up defensively. .

In its 17-10 loss against Maryland,
the Temple defense managed to hold
the Terrapins to 254 total offensive
yards, 100 of which were gained on th

ground. . ’
g _ These statistics left Wallace and his
assistant coaches dumbfounded.

Wallace realized his offense is: very
potent and his defense is even more

tenacious,“ ) ‘  5 4

“We just have a problem getting in

A the end zone,” Wallace said during the

weekly Big East teleconference.’
. -He also credits the lack of _ scoring
to his young offense and common

offensive mistakes that come along.

with having a young team.

“[we] have to keep playing hard,
and have to work on minimizing offen-
sive mistakes,” Wallace said. “Then
we’ll be very competitive.”

Even a lengthy suspension from
baseball has not stopped Strawberry
from showcasing his athletic
prowess. He’_s able to put his speed
and agility to good use by running
away from his problems. This inci-
dent, in turn, just led to the bigger

Engle. “I’d say it was the opposite. We
were ﬂat. Look at all those mistakes.
That’s ‘because the boys were too
tight.”. '

while waiting for Clark to kick the field

' goal.

“I wouldn’t have sent him in if I
wasn’t confident that he could do it.”
But he was the first person out on

- the field to congratulate Clark.

The person who deserves the most
congratulations is Kenny Lucas, who
ended his college career with an output

not many will forget. He completed 18 »
' of 24 passes-for 228 yards and shocked
' the Lions with 52 yards on the quarter-

back rollout.
“We just never expected Lucas to

' be running,” Engle said. “He did a great

job.”

For his efforts, Lucas was awarded
the James Coogan Award for the out-
standing player of the game. The 252
yards Lucas contributed to the offen-
sive brought his season total to 1,762
yards, breaking Fred Mazurek’s record
set in 1963. . V

“I wasn’t thinking of his record out
there today. I never had time,” Lucas
said. ' ‘

Two of the reasons for Lucas’ suc-

‘ cess Saturday were Barry McKnight

and Bob Longo. McKnight’s running
finally gave Lucas the option he had
been looking for all season to counter-
act the blitz. The senior fullback closed

it out the year in form reminiscent of last

year with 81 yards on 23 carries.
Longo, who had ‘been screaming
for more playing time all year, ﬁnally
got his chance when ‘Mickey
Rosoborough’s injured ankle kept him
out of the game. The sophomore end
latched on to six passes for 92 yards

’ and wasn’t stopped until the Lions

decided to double-team him.
. Safety Tippy Pohl, who never gets

his hands on the ball when the Panther ’

offensive team is in the game, was a
major factor in the ‘first—half scoring.

‘He knocked the ball loose three times

and recovered two fumbles.

Yellow cards were given_to three
other Panthers: redshirt freshman
midfielder Kimberly Sturk, freshman
forward Emily . Tipton and
Greenspoon.

Goalkeeper Rachel Brown earned

A her second victory of the year, mak-

ing six saves. The Wildcats had 21
shots compared to Pitt’s 13, but
Arizona could only get seven of them
on goal.

“We played a great first half,”
said Arizona head coach Cathy Klein.
“We had eight more shots than they
did, so we generated enough offense
to win the game. Pittsburgh really
handed it to us in the second half and
overtime. They beat us fair and

   

square.”

Arizona,State 7, Pitt 0.

With a’ victory at Tucson, Ariz., in
hand, the Panthers hopped a bus and
traveled to Tempe, Ariz., to take on
the Sun Devils of Arizona State, a

Feulner added ‘the next three
goals to score a hat-trick and madeit
a 4-0 game with -help from Holly

the first goal and Emily Schwimmer
on the next two. Feulner is only the
second person to score a hat-trick in

school history since Clark did it in .
