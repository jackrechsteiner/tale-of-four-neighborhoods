VOLUME XCVHI, NUMBER 71

Same-sex case may
havebroad effects

Staff Writer

What do a law student, an associate pro-
fessor, the American Civil Liberties Union
and a state senator have m common? They
are all opposed to the legal actions that Pitt
has‘ taken in its defense of the right to deny
same—sex health beneﬁts to its employees.

A forum to discuss both the impact’ of
Pitt’s lawsuit against the city, as well as the
broader implications that a legal success by

Pitt might have, was held in Room 324 of
the Cathedral of Learning Monday night.
, Deborah Brake, an associate professor
of law at Pitt, spoke about the broader legal
repercussions of a Pit victory against the

city.

She also discussed the future of local

law and the ability of localities topass legis-
lation. I .

» “Their arguments are not  to
same—sex beneﬁts, nor are they limited to
Pittsburgh,” Brake said, addressing the
effects the legal actions could have on the
rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgen-

dered and queer people. -

Vice Chancellor» for Public Affairs
Robert Hill, who was not at the forum,
responded to the issues discussed during the
evening, saying that the University “is a
defendant in the actions before the Human
Relations Committee.”

“We never wanted this litigation,” Hill
said. “We didn’t start it, but the University
has a responsibility to defend itself vigorous-

Union on Monday. The display was part of the week-long remembrance of Kristallnacht.

Hillel remembers Kristallnacht

MALLORY WOMER
Staff Writer ’

The image of a cathedral reflected‘

onto the television screen, which was
playing a video outlining the destruction
of the religious buildings of the Jews in
Nazi Germany. '

The video, which detailed
Kristallnacht, played Monday outside of
the William Pitt Union, where onlookers

could see the image of the. Cathedral of-

Learningreﬂecting onto the screen from

across Bigelow Boulevard.

On Kristallnacht, which translates to
“The.Night of Broken Glass,” the win-
dows were smashed and the merchandise
destroyed‘ in Jewish shops and depart-
ment stores A within Nazi-controlled
Europe. On the same night, Nov. 9, 1938,
and into the next. day, 267 synagogues
were -burned and 91 Jews were killed,
according to a history packet provided by
members of Hillel, an international orga-
nization for Jewish students. ' ' ~

“ Kristallnacht occurred after Herschel '

Grynszpan, a 17-year-old Jew, murdered

. a member of the German Embassy staff

in Paris, according to the same ‘history
packet.
Hillel will host a week full of events

dedicated to the remembrance‘ of

Kristallnacht. The week began with a‘
glass-breaking on the patio of the
William Pitt Union on Monday after-
noon, and will ‘end with a trip to the
United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington, D.C. on
Sunday. . I .

The members of Hillel were not
actually permitted to break glass in ﬁont
of onlookers, so they instead made a dis-
play of the broken glass and glued glass
shards ‘ to posters describing
Kristallnacht.

Despite debt, Veterans

Day Parade went on

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

This year’s Veterans Day Parade

marched on, despite a
budget deﬁcit that creat-
ed a $7,000 debt for the
city to cover the costs of
the event.

City council,
Allegheny County and
the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania came to

the rescue by providing _

funds for the parade,
according to Alan
Hertzberg, a councilman
for the city of Pittsburgh.

Veterans had been
worried that they would
not be recognized this
year with the annual

about the importance of recognizing those

who fought for American freedom.
There are more than 26 million veter-

ans in the United States and more than

250,000 veterans in the
Pittsburgh metropolitan
area, according to the
2000 U.S. census.

The Veterans Day
Parade is the one armual
event that recognizes vet-
erans for their sacriﬁces,
which often affect the rest
of their lives —— more than
29 percent of all veterans
are disabled.

’ At the parade, the group

Veterans for Peace passed
out ﬂyers that urged an
end to the current military
campaign against Iraq.
“This is not the type of

Veterans Day parade.

“We fought to make
sure there was [a parade],” said Joe
Iacono, a member of the Vietnam Veterans
Inc. and a writer for the group’s newslet-
ter.

“Veterans won the freedom that
allows you to stage parades,” Iacono said

war they signed up for,” a
member of the group,
Sanford Kelson, said.
“It’s got something to do with oil and
imperialism,” he added.
Despite the cool, rainy weather, the
turnout for the parade was comparable to
last year.

ly.”

Hill added that Pitt still believes the
appropriate resolution would be an “out—of-
court one.”

“VVe’re still hopeful for such a resolu-
tion,” he said. u » ’

‘ Carey Cummings, a third—year law stu-
dent at Pitt, spoke about the origins of the
case, as well as what Pitt might be doing to
its reputation by taking legal actions against
the equal rights ordinance passed by the city.

" “It’s not an argument that Pitt should be
making, especially as the city’s largest
employer,” Cummings said. i

“It’s just a ridiculous, ridiculous argu-
ment,” Cummings added.

About 10 years ago, the city of
Pittsburgh passed an ordinance that reaf-
ﬁrmed the city’s comrnitrnent_ against dis-
crimination based on sexual orientation, as
well as race, creed, gender or age.

A little more than seven years ago,
Deborah Henson, an employee at the time,
requested that Pitt provide her domestic part-
ner with health beneﬁts, as Pitt does for those
who are married, whether by ceremony or
common law. -

Pitt denied her request, saying that Pitt’s
policy only provided health beneﬁts to
employees who are married — and marriage
is deﬁned in Pennsylvania as being a union
between a man and a woman.

Henson, with the support of other
employees and the ACLU, sued the
University for violating the equal rights ordi-
nance that the city had passed.

Pitt later ﬁled a lawsuit against the city,
saying that Pittsburgh carmot pass such an
ordinance because the city cannot expand
upon the state statutes for prohibiting dis-
crimination.

The lawsuit against Pitt was suspended
for a period of time, when both parties
agreed to the formation of a committee to
study the feasibility of instituting such a pol-

_ icy at Pitt.

The committee decided that such a pol-
icy would work at Pitt, but that it might draw
ﬁnancial backlash from certain conservative
elements of the state legislature.

The suit has since been revived.

Lai—San K Seto, programs coordinator
for the greater Pittsburgh chapter of the
ACLU, ﬁrst explained the entire situation in
greater detail, then focused on whatgshe felt
to’ be the most important issue behind the
case.

“This is a question about fairness for all .

of us,” Seto said.‘

‘The University has decided not to treat
its own employees fairly,” Seto added.

State Sen. Jim Ferlo, D—I-Iighland Park,
one of the original co-authors of the
Pittsburgh equal rightsordinance, also came

throughout the world that there was
something very wrong going on in
Germany,” she said, explaining why it is
important for people to know about the
history of Kristallnacht.

Later that night, at the Hillel Jewish
University Center on Forbes Avenue,
Fritz Ottenheimer, a Jewish man who
lived in Konstanz, Germany when
Kristallnacht occurred, spoke to students
from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University, as well as community mem-
bers.

“On the morning of Nov. 10, 1938, I
was awoken by a loud explosion,”
Ottenheimer said. “So I ran downstairs
and outside and saw that, where normal-

ly our beautiful synagogue was, now

stood a wall of ﬂames.”

Ottenheimer later learned that a
Schutzstaffel, or SS, demolition team had
blown 'up the synagogue. Unlike most
other German towns with a Jewish popu-
lation, there were no broken store win-
dows in. Konstanz, he added. ,

Later that day, members of the
Gestapo arrested Ottenheimer’s father, as
well as 30,000 other Jewish men through-

THE PITT NEWS

Jewish man who lived in Germany during
Kristallnacht recounts thenight to students

out Germany. They took him to Dachau,
a concentration camp, where there were
30,000 prison uniforms waiting for use.

Ottenheimer made it clear that, at this
time in history, the father was , a very
important ﬁgure in within the family.

“When you take the father away
from the family, it is like. decapitating
someone,” he said.

Ottenheimer’s father was one of the
lucky‘ men who survived the concentra-
tion camp and was permitted to return
home in late December. All of the men
who survived were released within one to
six months after their arrests.

Ottenheimer believes that the pur-
pose of arresting so many Jews was “to
scare people into leaving Germany.”

“Hitler’s early goal was not to kill the
Jews, but to drive them out of Germany,”
he ‘said.

' After years of trying to emigrate
from Germany, the family was finally
able to leave in May 1939 —— at the age of
14, Ottenheimer and his parents moved to
the United States to join his sister. During
World War II and the years preceding it,
immigration quotas made it very hard for
German Jews to move into the United
States, he said. For this reason, there was
an intense process of reviews on sponsor-

grate.

After getting through college,
Ottenheimer joined the U.S. Army.

“I was privileged enough to take part
in the final drive across Germany,” he
said. “As my father fought for his father-
land and earned honors, I was an
American soldier ﬁghting against my
fatherland in World War II.”

As a result of Kristallnacht, and then
the Holocaust, Ottenheimer has experi-
enced a change in his beliefs in God.

“It changed my understanding of
God and how He works,” he said. “Now
I see God more as a miraculous creator,
but when things get tough, I still ﬁnd
myself asking God for help.”

To help those in the audience who
could not comprehend the loss that Jews
felt during and after World War II,
Ottenheimer likened the period to Sept.
11, 2001. On this day, 3,000 people were
killed. Throughout the Holocaust, which
lasted about 2,000 days, six million Jews
were killed.

This means that about 3,000 Jewish
people were killed each day.

“Everyday, for 2,000 days, there was
that kind of disaster, and it was all caused
by hatred,” he said.

Ferlo says Pitt’s

actions “immoral

and reprehensible”
Beneﬁts, page 2

tospeak

Ferlo discussed his personal feelings
about the actions taken by Pitt, say-
ing that he felt the actions of Pitt
and its board of trustees were
“immoral and reprehensible.” He
also pointed out the need for
greater participation to defend the
ordinance.

“It is very critical that we do
anything to preserve and protect the
ordinance,’_’ Ferlo said. “The
actions of the University and the
chancellor are backward actions.”

After all of the members of the
forum had spoken, the audience
was given a chance to ask questions
of them.

When one student stood up and
asked what Pitt had to gain from its
lawsuit against the city ordinance,
associate law professor Deborah
Brake had no answer.

“Besides not offering benefits
to same-sex partners?” asked
Brake. “I have no idea.”

“If young people had voted, we
would have never gone to war,” he
said. “If young people had voted, I
-wouldn’t be getting a big f—-ing tax
break.”
Simmons’ language was undeni-

_ ably peppered with profanity, a fact

that he noted and then commented on.
“It’s not the curse words I’m wor-
ried about, it’s the cursed ideas,”
Simmons said.
When asked where hip-hop would
be in five years, Simmons emphasized
what he sees as the positive aspects of

Simmons added, to the laughter of the
crowd. m

Simmons began his life in New
York — Hollis, Queens --— and since
then has developed a conglomerate,
Rush Communications, which has an
estimated worth of $200 million, and
includes his Phat Farm clothing divi-
sion, Def Pictures and Oneworld
Magazine. Simmons recently orga-
nized the creation of the Hip Hop
Summit Action Network, which pro-
motes political awareness while seek-
ing to unite the hip-hop community
with political causes. He said that the
community has the opportunity to use
its worldwide popularity to motivate

young people into political action.
“Jay—Z and [P. Diddy] are more
wel1—liked and listened-to across this
world by young people, certainly, than
Bush or Rumsfeld,” Simmons said.
The only uncomfortable point in
the evening came when a woman
asked Simmons why he did not adver-
tise in black newspapers. He appeared
ﬂustered and listed a number of mag-
azines that he advertised in, saying
that he did not think that the readers. of
newspapers were his target audience.
According to Hanaan Sarhan,
director of the of the Pitt Program
Council Lecture Committee, the deci-
sion to have Simmons speak was

motivated less by his wealth and suc-
cess than by his willingness to express

his views and respond to the people if

attending the event.

“I thought it was really important
to bring in someone with a message,”
she said. “Someone who had some-
thing to say and wasn’t just_ going to
get up there ‘and talk about how
famous they are.”

While she couldn’t disclose how
much Simmons was paid for his
appearance, Sarhan said his asking fee
usually ranges ' from $20,000 to
$30,000, and that he would be donat-
ing Monday night’s fee to the Hip Hop
Summit Action Network.

the hip-hop scene, talking about the ,
1 poetry, fashion and publishing move-

ments and the need for young people
to dig in in all of those sectors.
“The elevator is broke,” Simmons
said. “You gotta climb the stairs.”
He also spoke passionately about
what is and is not detrimental to the
hip-hop community. Simmons defend-
ed current top rap artists and their
lyrics, saying that the explicit nature
of their lyrics comes from the explicit
nature of the lives they lead and, as
such, should not be attacked. \
“When people hear the 50 Cent
album, they say, ‘Why would he say
these things?” Simmons said. “Well,
why not  the records people are say-
ing are detrimental are the ones we
have to listen to.” i -
Education in all its forms was key
to Simmons’ talk. He told the audi-
H ence that to do anything — business
or anything else — “you have to do
the work” And that, he said, means
“more than listen[ing] to rap records.

0 You have to know how to turn on the

six o’ clock news.”

When asked what it takes to
become a successful entrepreneur,
Simmons stressed the importance of
hard work and not being blinded by
the rewards of great wealth. .

“Don’t attach yourself to the
results,” he said. “Gorto work, put
your head down and enjoy the
process.”

It’s this work ethic that Simmons
"said separates‘, those who are less
motivated, or “quitters,” from those

who move up from intern to execu-

tive. - .

\ He added that having such a work
ethic meant his .own life wasn’t as
glamorous as people might think.

“I get up at five in the morning, I

_. kiss my baby, Igo downstairs, work

out, go, sit in meditation, and‘ go to
work,” Simmons said. “I work. until I

come home, and "my baby’s_ in the

same bed. I kiss her and go to bed. Get
‘up the next morning and do the same
shit.” ‘

“I’ve got a 30,000 square foot

house, and I can only sit on one seat,”

Dorm safety at Penn State questionable

Love them or hate them, dormi-
tories are the home of choice for
many students while at school.
They are conveniently close to
campus, they provide a way to meet
other students, and — perhaps most
importantly they are safe.

At least, they are presumed to
be so.

Last week, at Pennsylvania
State University, three women liv-
ing in McKean Hall reported that a
man entered their rooms at night
without their invitations or consent.
One woman says the man — author-
ities believe it is the same man in
all cases — touched her inappropri-
ately before she woke up.

Penn State’s security system
differs from Pitt’s. At Pitt, residents
must swipe their Pitt ID, then a
guard unlocks the door, ideally
after examining the card to ensure
that the student who stands before
them is the same one pictured on
the card.

At Penn State, there are no
guards. Swiping a valid ID unlocks
the door —— there’s no guard in the
transaction. ' ’

Every dorm dweller has had an
inconvenient moment with a securi-
ty guard making them wait while he
or she scrutinizes their ID. And
extended guest forms, required for
overnight guests on weekdays, can
be a pain to remember at 1:50 a.m.,

10 m_inutes before a guest becomes
a violation. .

But all these minor inconve-
niences add up to one thing —- safe-
ty. .
No one gets into a Pitt dorm
without a security guard knowing
about it. Guests can’t even walk
themselves out — their host must
sign them out or risk sanctions —
so no one can wander the halls.

All three of the women at Penn’

State had their doors unlocked. It
stands to reason that, sleeping in a
building you perceive to be secure,
you might not feel the need to lock
yourself in your room.

This ‘man could have gained
entry to McKean Hall in any num-
ber of ways. He could know some-
one else in the building. He might
even live there. He also could have
found a lost, valid ID and simply let
himself in. .

lt’s chilling to think that a mat-
ter as simple as misplacing your
student ID could lead to a home
invasion, but at Penn State, it
apparently can. Someone could find
one, look up the rightful owner,
find out what dorm they live in, and
have free access to that building.

Penn State has a huge campus.

Did I steal his column from the Internet

V I was up late, working under a deadline,

think I’d had about eight or nine or 20

‘ Mountain Dews in the last hour and I started

to feel my body sublimate into pure energy.
I may be some sort of glowing, plasma-
based life form by the time you read this.

I was stuck for a topic so I did what any-
one would: I went to the

of a_ major corporation such as Enron,
WorldCom or Global Crossing- Justice
would be‘ served and cheaters and 
would quickly be cast down to the ﬁery
depths where they belong.

As Iread further, though, I stole another
idea: what if the students weren’t to blame?
One of my ‘friends in the survey wrote, “If

college students are paying
_for, and in a quote that tangen-

sentences to a full paragraph from the Web
without citing the source.” I didn’t get that
from the New York Times, but did the
research on my own, asking my 18,000 clos-
est student friends, 2,600 faculty members
“at large public universities and small private
colleges nationwi .”

Thirty-eight percent! That’s a lot. of per-
cent! I found it pretty hard to believe so
many of my ﬁiends were engaging in pla-
giarism. Then I thought about how often I’d
heard them describe Radiohead as “listen-'
able.” Clearly they were copying from each
other, because no one could possibly come
to that conclusion on his or her own.

OK, so my friends are liars and cheats,
or at least a good percentage of them. What
did this mean? I had another dozen

Another student’ commented, “If teach-

Though the 18,000 friends I interviewed for
my survey "are all anonymous, I can only
assume this one was in a logic class. Think
about it: if teachers taught better, we would-

.n’t have to cheat.

Similarly, another comment: ‘Maybe
schools and parents should focus on learning

instead of grades.” Do you see? If the focus

weremore on learning instead of on testing
whether or not we’d learned something, stu-
dents. would be less likely to cheat to get
higher grades and would instead spend their
time learning.

' ‘In conclusion, I’d 1ike‘to conclude with

Feeling the awesome power of a killing machine

I am being educated in the
devices of killing.

Specifically, I am being taught
how to hunt.

Now, I am talking about hunting
deer, not huddling in some clock
tower, picking off random human
life forms. But I’m realizing that
the line that separates the two is
actually much thinner than I ever
considered,

We are all killers in some
respect. We’ve stepped on a bug, hit
a bird with a baseball, or run over a
squirrel with our car.

Some of us are intentional
killers, frying bugs with magnifying
glasses, shooting birds with a B.B.
gun, or running over squirrels with
a lawnmower. , ‘

Finally, some of us are hunters,
who carefully formulate and plan to
terminate life and gather the instru-
ments needed to complete the task.
We all know how to kill, but some
of us know better than others, and
some of us act on it.

Hunting has long been a tradi-
tion on both sides of my family. The
gun th-at I own came into my pos-
session via my grandfather’s last
will and testament.

Upon his passing, his
Winchester .308 rifle was passed
into my hands. Actually, more like

my attic. That gun sat in its case for, it, how to fire it and how to clean it.

"close to 10 years, unused

in both its designed pur-
pose and the knowledge
that accompanied it.

While I never had a
problem with hunting or
killing animals, I previ-
ously never felt any
desire to align myself
with that world.

I have been a carni-
vore all my life, but
always felt content pur-
chasing my meat from
the local grocery. That

changed when a friend of mine‘

invited me to' hishouse to enjoy a
dinner of venison.

It tasted amazing. It was some
of the finest animal ﬂesh I have
ever eaten. I longed to obtain more
of it and knew the means I would
have to employ to get it.

Convincing my dad to teach me
to hunt was the simplest process I
have ever completed in my life. The
phrase, “Dad, I want to go hunting
this year,” was all it took. .He
arranged everything from that
point.

, Last weekend, the gun came
down from its dusty quarters, and
the education process began. I was
taught how it worked, how to load

 

David J. McCarthy

Columnist

Later, we journeyed
to a sportsman’s club to

practice working the
firearm.
For me, and for

almost anyone I talk to,
firing a gun provides you
with an intense rush. I
now have a device capa-
ble of easily -and effec-
tively destroying life. I
now have the knowledge
to work it. 0 ‘

As I was taught at
the firing range,
knowledge comes with responsibili-
ty. My dad warned me about the
dangers of the gun, about keeping it
pointed up when not in use and hav-
ing the safety on until the moment it
was intended to be discharged.

But unlike, say, the “dangers of
alcohol or sex,” the gun is very
physically real, as opposed to being

theoretically dangerous". Anyone

who has seen nearly any movie or
TV show has witnessed people
dying via the gun. Some of us have
even witnessed the act in ‘real life.

What I held in my hands that
day was the world’s most notorious
killing machine. ‘

I have no plans of becoming a

serial murderer. But a cold fact.

this A

struck me that day: if I wanted to, I
now had a much better chance of
succeeding. .

Before my education, I honestly

did not know how to work a gun. '

Perhaps I could have figured it out,
but now, it is all laid out for me.

I now understand why people
fight hard to protect their “right to
bear arms.” I now know why groups
like the National Rifle Association
exist. I

Guns are just a different kind of
drug, and the high you get off firing
one .is unlike anything else. A

But the other lesson I learned on
that chilly morning at the firing
range was that you really don’t
understand anything until you expe-
rience it. . A

I always knew how to kill, but
now it is easier forme to act on it,
and I comprehend the responsibility
that comes with learning that. I only
can wonder what I will learn in a
month, when I attempt ‘a premedi-
tated killing for the first time.

David J is secretly hoping that
when he shoots his first deer, every-
thing goes quiet and Nancy
Sinatra’s “Bang Bang (My Baby
Shot Me Down)” plays in the back-
ground. Shoot ,_yourself down at
davidj@pittnews.com. '

Ah, can you smell that in the air, friends? That’s
the smell of hot, freshly—advertised capitalism. Just
listen to the idyllic sounds of chirpy-voiced chickies
entreating you to buy worthless twaddle. Yes sir, it’s
another beautiful day in consumerist-America
— unless you don’t like being told what to
think, of course.

It’s as if we’re in some sort of psycholog-
ical war. Every day we’re bombarded with
ceaseless volleys of invasive propaganda in a
constant effort to manipulate our desires and
emotions. Resistance is futile. There will be
no recreation without brand name propaga-
tion." A

The list of activities that aren’t peppered
liberally with brand names and special offers
has become quite short. I suppose it could be
worse. At least we can still generally read
books without being subliminally told to buy
something. The day we start seeing advertisements
sneaking subversively into our novels to leer obtru-
sively up at us while we read will mark the precipi-
tous downfall of Western civilization as we know it.

I can just hear the secret mantra of every ad exec
across the nation: Profit from people’s weaknesses,
whisper to the whip—cracking overseers of speedand
convenience, massage ‘their egos, convince them that
scantily—clad women will materialize and rub them-
selves against one another suggestively if they drink
our watery beer. But, whatever it is, make it good;

    

i..i~i;1y

we’ve got superfluous crap to peddle.

Often, advertisements do nothing more than
show us something without even necessarily
explaining what it’s good for, or why it’s better. They

say that advertisement is all about
name recognition. When you think
about it, it’s a pretty funny concept,
name recognition. Essentially, they
want us to hear their brand name so
many times that it etches itself
indelibly into our memory, next to
the name of our childhood dog and
favorite aunt. Many advertisers
aren’t satisfied until we subcon-
sciously ascribe some sort of bizarre
sentient identity to their products.
~After inevitably succumbing to the
tireless assaults of anthropomor-
V phized food, we’re expected to
develop loyalties for our new nonexistent capitalist
friends. We meet again, Phizz Cola. Ah, Sucrose
Blast, it’s been too long.

Consequently, we’re all indoctrinated from birth
with this blinding desire for the most inane and
pointless things. Even I have to stemly rein in my
inexplicable urges to buy the latest timesaving won-

ning tie rack to replace my antiquated stationary V

Without advertising, how would we know what to think?

one? My prayers have been answered!
Sure, it’s all very irritating, but what’s the harm

in it, you ask? For the less intellectually independent

among us, possession comes to mean success and
happiness. Consumerism becomes not only a sup-
posed means to contentment, but also a status sym-
bol. Sad as it is, I’ve heard countless smug barbs
made about so—and-so and how he drives a crappy
car. ' , ' .

It’s pretty scary just how effective all this propa-

ganda is. People get so hung up on their brand" pref-

erences that they scorn and judge people who prefer
the competition. I can’t count the number of times
I’ve argued passionately about which cola is better,
or which operating system I prefer, or where I go for
coffee. Just how’ seriously people take their con-
sumerist obsessions belies how great a role it plays
in American culture and society at large’.

Despite all this, I would still like. to think that
none of us are truly capitalist drones who work sole-
ly to buy packaged happiness from grinning mongers
of materialism. We still know what’s really impor-
tant in life: friends, family, puppies and kittens,
among other things. So’ don’t be fooled, fellow
Americans. It doesn’t really matter what you prefer,
as long as you don’t lord it over the guy next to you.

J.P. F ridy urges you to throw oﬁ‘ the shackles of cap-
italist materialism and send him your most valued
possessions. He can be reached at jzf7 @pitt.edu.

AWK: Hunry

_ , Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

like The Wolf

If you think that rocker Andrew W.K’s
energy stops when he gets offstage, think
again. In a conference—call phone interview,
every sentence he spoke was quick and
urgent, though not due to lack of time. He is
the rock joumalist’s dream interview: rather
than the dreaded one-word answers, W.K.
will spout oif paragraphs of information,
sometimes digressing from the original
question asked — but the information he
shares is so insightful, there is no room for
complaints.

Perhaps he’s best known for “partying
hard” or “until you puke,” as seemed to be
the theme of his debut album, I Get Wet. It
appears as though his ‘80s—inﬂuenced power
ballads aren’t known from radio airplay or
from TRL spots on MTV. Rather, his songs
have provided quite a soundtrack for com-
mercials in the recent months: “It’s Time to
Party” was featured on an advertisement for
Expedia.com, he put a new spin on the Kit
Kat jingle, “Gimme a Break,” not to men-
tion providing music for Target and Coors
Light ads. And MTV can’t seem to produce
one of its signature reality shows without
using one of W.K.'s songs in the soundtrack.

 whose signature look consists of
extremely faded, acid—washed jeans, a dirty
white T-shirt and white tennis shoes,
released his sophomore album, The Wolﬁ at
the beginning of September, and its tone is a
bit different than the partying vibe of I Get
Wet. Never fear, he hasn’t “grown up” and
written songs with a more mature feel since
Wet.

“A lot of these new songs were actually
written before or during the time of record-
ing I Get Wet,” said W.K. “A lot of the parts,
a lot of the lyrics, a lot of the melodies — the

music itself— has been around just as long,
if not longer. I just didn’t feel that I had
earned —— that I had proved myself to this
music yet It’s not about proving myself to
the world, it’s more about [the fact that] I
hadn’t shown this music yet, what exactly I
was able to do.”

What the album does have, however, is
a huge, powerful sound. According to W.K.,
it was a more organized recording process
that allowed the album’s multitude of
recording tracks to stack up “really nicely.”

‘There are more tracks on this album,
quite a bit. I think the most that we had on
any song to mix with was 110. And then the
average was between 90 to 100. It depends
on how you look at it, because a lot of the
tracks were vouched down, meaning there
are too many tracks to mix with and we had
to put things into groups,” W.K. explained.
“So there might be 80 or 100 tracks of
vocals to make up the vocal sound, but
they’re not all on their own track — they’re
grouped into a big set of tracks. Otherwise,
we would have had, like, 400 tracks, and that
would have been insane.”

The Wolf was creating a buzz months
before its release date, as rumors circulated
about different titles for it, the most contro-
versial being Blow Your Bone.

“I could have called it [Blow Your
Bone] if I wanted to; I chose not to. Things
were taken a little out of context in terms of
that album title. I guess it was being pro-
moted by a certain place on the Internet as it
being the album title. Which is ﬁne, but it
was never the album title. It was one of
about 10 titles at that point,” said WK.

“I had never chosen one way or anoth-
er until, literally, like a few hours before the

Eye " " ' ‘ . I — ..-.

actual-deadline on the album. I had about

200 album titles on my list,” he continued.
WK hasn’t played a showin Pittsburgh

played on 2003’s Vans Warped Tour,

with cliches, and ‘.‘Elf” is no different.
However, that does not stop it from
being a hilarious take onthe Christmas
spirit. It’s a funny and hearltvi/‘airming
ﬁlm that sets the mood for the upcom-
ing holiday season.

Buddy (Will Ferrell) is a 6—foot-3-

inch elf ——well, hefs not exactly an elf; 
as Buddy puts" it‘, he’s a"‘h'uman raised“

by elves.” The story starts 30 years
prior, when Santa Claus (Ed Asner)
stops by an orphanage to drop off pre-
sents and baby’ Buddy crawls into
Santa’s bag. ‘ _‘ e ,4
Upon arrival to the ‘North, Pole,
Santa ﬁnds out. that he has returned
with his tiny stowaway, and-Santa and
the elves decide to raise him as their
own. Buddy is adopted by Papa Elf
(Bob Newhart) and is raised like any
elfin child -— learning how to make
toys and learning the Code of the Elves,
which includes the all important rule,
“The best way to spread Christmas
cheer is singing, loud forall to hear.”
Buddy is"lat"er‘ told‘*that-he is not
really an elf, he’s a human, and he sets
out on his journey to ﬁnd-his real father,
who doesn’t even know he exists:

Buddy’s father, Walter, (James Caan) is-

the head of a department in charge of
making children’s books for a publish-

ing company. Walter is so wrapped up
in work and making money that he i

doesn’t ﬁnd time for his other son,
Michael (Daniel Tay), let alone Buddy.

Buddy finds that he doesn’t fit in
anywhere when he messes things up
over and over, and the only people that

‘really see the good’ in Buddy are

Mich_ael and Jovie, (Zooey Deschanel)

_ aA_[,b,e,autiful woman whom Buddy falls

in love with and who works as a depart-
ment store elf.

Buddy has to help save Christmas
when Santa’s sleigh loses its. carbine
engine and doesn’t have enough‘ fuel in
the Clauseometer, which measures
Christmas spirit, and he crashes in
Central Park. They then have to work to

get the people of New York to believe

in Santa again, and they use the most
important Code of the Elves, as Jovie
leads a large group of people in singing
“Santa Claus is Coming to Town.”
Will Ferrell‘ is great as an innocent
and humble man who is -just trying to
do what he thinks is -right-for Christmas
spirit. James Caan also plays his role as
the father very well. All of the charac-
ters were believable and -the script —
although filled with cliches, like any

Christmas movie — is hilarious.

Jon Favreau, of “Swingers” and
“Made” fame, does a good job in giving
the North’Pole a nostalgic and over—the-

T top feel, much like the claymation sets

from Rudolph animated features. The

elves’ costumes look great and are also

reminiscent of those old, clay ﬂicks.
With‘ its comedy and touching

‘warmth,’ “Elf ’ is a great movie for the

whole family,’with some jokes that only
the adults will get, as well as a new
installment in the Christmas movie
genre that’s definitely worth watching.

Over the course of its fairly short
career, Appleseed Cast has been a
musical chameleon, shifting stylistic
focus, in between heartbeats, from
heart-wrenching emo to wand-waving
experimental rock, and always squeez-
ing room in for brooding pop songs
with big ideas.

With their first two releases, The
End of the Ring Wars and Mare Wtalis,
Appleseed Cast placed themselves
among emo’s intelligentsia, a credit to

their keen ability to balance the

track, “Hello Dearest Love,” builds
interlocking, sleepy guitars and clunk-

The rest of the album offers some of

Wainwright’s latest one will
leave you eager for number two

Want One

Rufus Wainwright
Dreamworks Records
*;‘r‘~,"r‘:,“r‘l /2

Rufus Wainwright is the life of the
paity. He’s the kind of guy who’d show up
at a wedding in a polka dot suit, -drink
himself silly, ﬁght the bridesmaids to
catch the bouquet, fall in love with the
wedding singer and have his heart broken,
all in the span of 45 minutes.

Lucky for us, he’d probably write a
song or two about it afterwards, staying up
until 5 a.m., chain smoking and watching
syndicated Oprah reruns in the meantime.

Over the years, we’ve come to know
Wainwright as a bit of a lush, a bit of a
drama queen, a bit of a romanticist, but all
the same, an astounding musician with a
hyperactive imagination.

In fact, the ﬁrst track on Want One,
“Oh What a World,” exceeds the
grandiose production and choral orches-
tration that have come to be mainstays in
his material. While sister Martha
Wainwright and a jolly chorus of others
hum like songbirds in the background,
Rufus gets busy in the spotlight, spotting
“men reading fashion magazines,” and
envisioning a New York Times headline

that reads “Life is Beautiful.” All of this is
over tuba burps, harp pluckings and a
steady beat of horse clops.

The following track, “I Don’t Know
What it Is,” reintroduces Wainwright’s
jumpy piano, over which he throws a
“bucket of rhymes” and demands, “Give
me Calais/or give me Dover.”

While the jovial “Vibrate” ﬁnds
Wainwright crooning, “I tried to dance

Britney Spears/I guess I’m getting on in 4

years,” the big-band production that fol-
lows it ﬁnds him coming home to “14th
Street,” where he’ll “learn how to save/not
just borrow.”

Like most records, Want One has its
highs and lows. Though all of thesesongs
are brimming with passion and brilliant
melody, Wainwright’s inherent softness
sometimes has him getting all too close to
pushing the adult contemporary envelope
— his sharp sense of humor and operatic
prerogative never failing to swoop in to
the rescue.

Want One is the ﬁrst installment of a
two—part series, with Want Two due out
sometime early next year. On his Web site,
Wainwright explains, “Want Two will
have some of the more daunting tracks,
the operatic, weird stuff, some heavy
numbers that relate to my classical sensi-

It’s easy to believe Wainwright when

the character list — which spans from
the always-popular Ron Jeremy to the

utter the word “pity” in this game. Ever.
If that’s not a cardinal sin, I don’t know
what is. Word has it that a soundtrack

a soundtrack to begin with. It was just

it’s become an expectation that the

Five Pitt wrestlers placed, including fresh-
man Drew Headlee, at 125 pounds, as the Pitt
wrestling team opened its season’ last weekend at
the Michigan State Open. “Overall, we did
pretty well,” assistant'coach'Jason Peters said.
“We competed hard and wrestled well.”

H_eadlee, competing in his first meet for Pitt,
defeated two seeded wrestlers, including No. 1
seed Tom Clum of Wisconsin, to earn a second-
place finish. Clum was ranked sixth and seventh
in the nation by wrestling magazines Amateur

Wrestling News and=,InterMat, respectively.-

Headlee collected anindividual record of 4-1 at

the event. A -- .. V * . . '
“Drew did well,” Peters said. “He wrestled

hard and he didn’t get tired.” ‘
Sophomore Francis Iorfido also turned in a

“solid performance for the Panthers advancing to

the finals in the 174-pound weight-class before

bowing out due to an injury he sustainedin the

semifinals. ' ~ ’ ‘
‘Iorfido finished the meet with an undefeated

record of 5-0 to complement his second-place

finish. Iorfido‘, in finishing second, placed high-
er than nationally ranked grapplers Ralph
DeNisco of Wisconsin and Mitch Hancock of
Central Michigan. ‘ .
“[Iorfido] injured his shoulder, _but he’ll be

alright,” Peters said. “He wrestled a good tour-

nament, and therewas no need to risk anything.”

In the 157-pound weight class, sophomore
Justin Nestor. overcame an early quarterfinal
defeat to advance through the consolation rounds
to capture third place. ’ ‘

Nestor came back andpdefeated Ty Morgan of
Central Michigan after Morgan had, beaten him
in the quarterfinals. Nestor finished the tourna-
ment witha record of 6-1. _ »

“[Nestor] avenged the loss‘ [from his previ-
ous match],” Peters said. “He really just pound-
ed him [Morgan].”

Sophomore Ronald Tarquinio lost in the con-

solation finals of the 141—pound weight class for
a fourth—place finish. '

Tarquinio defeated Michigan State’ Andy
Simmons, the 1.2th—ranked wrestler in the nation,
on the way to. finishing the tournament with a
record of 4-2. ’ '

“Tarquinio did a nice job too,” Peters added.
“He wrestled in a tougher weight class.”

place finish in the 149—pound weight class.
Kocher rallied from a close loss to 16th-ranked
Josh Wooton of Northern Illinois to compilea 4-

Pitt Rugby wins first Midwest Rugby Championship

Red Sox management give Pirates chance for better

manager and excuse to boot McClendon by firing Little

During Boston’s improbable run
to the American League
Championship Series, two former
Pittsburgh Pirates contributed to the
late season success of the Red Sox.

Pitchers Jeff Suppan and Scott
Sauerbeck, both Pirates at one point
last season, joined the Red Sox in
midseason and helped take Boston
to the -brink of the World Series.
Now, the Red Sox have returned the
favor.

No, the Red Sox haven’t traded
Nomar Garciaparra or Pedro
Martinez to the Pirates. In fact,
Boston isn’t even aware of the favor
they have done for the Pirates. V

That’s because Boston, in firing
manager Grady Little, has offered
the Pirates, along with every other
team in Major League, the opportu-
nity to hire one of the most success-
ful managers over the past two
years.

Over the past two years, Little
has a record of 188-136, a winning
percentage of approximately .600,
and one playoff berth. Sure, Little
made a mistake in allowing
Martinez to pitch late into game
seven of the ALCS against the hated

 

Yankees. But anyone, after gaining
the assurance of one of baseball’s
most dominant pitchers, would have
made the exact same move. ,
When the game is on the line,
you want and expect your best play-
ers to perform in the clutch. When
Michael Jordan had the ﬂu in game
five of the 1997 NBA Finals, do you
think coach Phil Jackson considered
sitting Jordan? Of course he did!
But Jordan assured Jackson that he
could still perform, and he did, scor-
ing 38 points. Little did what all
coaches should do -— he listened to
his players. ‘And he was fired for it.
Now the Pirates have the oppor-
tunity to hire Little, get rid of inef-
fective manager Lloyd McClendon
and compete for the National

League Central Division crown.
Sure, the Red Sox have such super-
stars as Martinez, Garciaparra, and
Manny Ramirez, but they also have
a lot of solid role players who Little
managed effectively in guiding the
Red Sox to consecutive 90 win sea-
sons. i

What has McClendon done over
the past two years? Last season, he
squandered ailineup of power-hit-
ters, former All-Stars, and role play-
ers as the Piratesfinished yet anoth-
er season under .500.

In fact, over the past two years,
McClendon has a record of 147-176,
a winning percentage of .450, and
two consecutive fourth—p1ace finish-
es in the weak National League
Central Division. Now, I’m not a
math major, but I’d say, that .600 is
much better than .450. Does it take a
brain surgeon to realize the upgrade
that is sitting out in the open, ‘ripe
for the picking?

Following the midseason fire
sale of its most recognizable play-

ers, the Pirates have accumulated

one of the major league’s finest
farm systems, filled with players
dripping with talent and potential. _

Add to that the presence of
Jason Bay, one of the Pirates’
youngest sluggers, and Tike
Redman, one of the fastest players
on the team, the Pirates’ potential is
exponential. However, Lloyd
McClendon is not the right man to
lead this team. A new manager, such
as Little, would energize this team
and guide it to a place it hasn’t been
in 11. years -— the postseason.

If it’s that clear to me, why
doesn’t General Manager Dave
Littlefield see the opportunity that
sits before him? Making poor
administrative decisions over the
past seven years (such as Jason
Kendall’s contract) put the Pirates
in their current situation.

Now the Red Sox have dangled a
line to pull them out of the.’ mess
they’re in, and the Pirates have yet
to reach for it. Will they grab the

, line and use the Red Sox’s mistake

to pull them back to respectability?
Or will they let yet another opportu-
nity pass them by? Only time will
tell.

laughing now?

- Sticking with college football, experts are
saying it is obvious that Oklahoma is the best
team in the country, but is it the best team ever?
After Saturday’s 77-0 win over Texas A&M, it
appears as though the Sooners could be. The
Aggies had more penalty yards (63) then they did
yards on offense (54). They managed just three
first downs and not once in the entire game did
they cross their own 40-yard line.

- Don’t look now but Pitt’s defensive most
valuable player shouldn’t be Lewis Moore or
Claude Harriott, although they are both having
good years. It should be redshirt freshman line-
backer Brian Bennett.

After registering eight tackles — one for a
loss — and forcing a fumble against Virginia Tech
Saturday night, Bennett is second on the team in
tackles with 84. He has six tackles for a loss and
leads the defense with three sacks.

He’s also forced two fumbles and recovered
another. Although this may be a surprise to many,
it’s not to me. I knew this kid was special ever
since I read that he had 25 tackles and returned an
interception for a touchdownin a state champi-

onship game in high school. V A I
- Switching over to Major League Baseball,
my home team, the Phillies, just traded for closer
Billy Wagner. What does this mean for Philly
fans? A lot. First, the Phils don’t need Jose Mesa
and his different color gloves anymore. Good rid-
dance to that.
Second, if the Phils find a way to persuade
Kevin Millwoo‘d to stay and can, afford his con-
tract, they easily become a World Series con-
tender. Lastly, it is more .motivation for Pat
Burrell, who shouldn’t need any after hitting .200
this past season, to stop heading down to
Delaware Avenue, where he has been known to
have a pretty blonde under one arm and a pretty
draft beer in the other. . \
- Jeff Long has not been the athletics director

at Pitt for that long, but already one of his first '

decisions seems to be the right one. Hiring Agnus
Berenato as the new head coach for women’s bas-
ketball has brought a new fire to the program and
very genuine person to the University.‘

Never mind that the Panthers lost an exhibi-
tion game already; give Berenato some time and
she will make Long and I look pretty smart.

- What do Quincy Wilson, Makonnen Fenton_

and Jarret Payton have in common? They are the

starting running backs for the teams that Pitt still
has to play this season. What else should they
have in common? They should all be benched
come game day against the Panthers.

Why? Because if I were the head coach_ at
West Virginia, Temple or Miami, I would. already
be conducting open try—outs for starting running
back for the Pitt game. Frat boys, intramural stars,
even women are welcome. There is only one
requirement if, you wish to try out. Your last name
must be Jones, because if it is, you are a sure thing
against that Panther defense. .

0 Finally, after Miami’s 10-6 loss to Tennesse
on Saturday, Miami tight end Kellen Winslow Jr.
lashed out at the referees and at his team for_its

poor play. In the "interview he arrogantly pro- A

claimed, “I’m a [expletive] soldier.”
. No, Kellen. The only thing you are ‘is “an
[expletive] j-ACC-ass.’’ ’

Matt Sortino is a staff writer for the Pitt Neivs and
he believes Pitt will beat Florida State in the
Orange Bowl, the Steelers will beat Baltimore in
-the last game of the season to make the playoﬁs
and the Phillies will beat the A’s in seven games
next year in the, World Series. «E-mail him at
