The Internal Revenue Service
announced last month that health

could cover OTC drugs. Pitt is
going to integrate that beneﬁt
into its employee ﬂex spend-
ing program, but there are still
some details to be worked out,

HR Associate Vice Chancellor‘ A

Ron Frisch told the University

Unfortunately, Frisch said,
the IRS “did not give any lead
time for an effective date or a lot
of direction on this. Therestill are
questions about whatis covered

think vitamins" are not covered.
But what if your doctor says you

issues will be worked out “within a ‘

month or two. Also, we believe that

tojuly 1, though I’m still not 100
percent sure ofthat yet.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Friends and co—workers of
Pitt staff member Michael Louis
Orosz all used the same word to
describe him: dedicated.

Orosz, who died suddenly at
his home in West Homestead
Sept. 28, 2003, was Arts and
Sciences facilities director for
the Clapp—Langley-Crawford
(CLC) complex. He was 36.

“I knew him for about 15
years,” said Chris Weinstein,
area coordinator in Facilities
Management, where Orosz
started his Pitt employment in
1990. “Mike always had a smile.
He was kind of a happy—go—lucky
guy, except when it came to his
work. He was the most dedicated
administrator I’ve ever known.”

W. Richard Howe, Arts
and Sciences associate dean for
administration, said, “Mike’s
death is a tragic blow to the
faculty, students and staff in
the Clapp-Langley-Crawford
departments that counted on
him for so many operational
details and to all ofus who knew
him as a friend and colleague.

Mike was totally dedicated to the I

fulﬁllment ofhis responsibilities
in the CLC complex. He knew
no limits as to the deﬁnition of
normal work hours. He was wed
to his beeper and cell phone.”
Weinstein said, “You could
never reach him in his office,”
which was ﬁlled with Panthers
athletics memorabilia. “He was

always on the job somewhere. But ,

he carried that cell phone every-
where. Itwas on 24/7, and he took

» ‘ it with’ him evenon vacations; so ‘
_ if someone had a problem he’d

be available to discuss it.”
In Orosz’s ca aci as direc-

and the department’s operations

of friends from all levels of the
University. He was close friends
with the University trades that
were invaluable to keeping the
Life Science Complex’s com-
plicated research labs operating
in an efﬁcient fashion. He was
equally friendly with the world-
class scientists who depended on
him for fully functioning facili-
ties,” Howe said.

Patty -Henry, administrative

said, “There’s deﬁnitely a void
left in the department. Yes, he
was a dedicated worker, but it
didn’t matter what level you

about him-, you just want to say,

Dave Malicki, who assisted
Orosz as operations manager,
and Robert Reich, the biologi-
cal sciences stockroom manager,
echoed others’ sentiments.

Action needed at 5th & Darragh

To the editor:

I havebeen crossing streets
in Oakland for 20 years and the
only time that I was almost hit by
a carwas today at the intersec-
tion of Darragh Street and Fifth
Avenue. John Diulus (Sept. 25,
2003, University Times) is abso-
lutely correct in warning about
the increased dangers at this
intersection since construction
on the biomedical tower began.
The problem is even r_nore,h_az—

‘ardous for’ the"’large"’numbér“of

older and disabled patients who

"must cross atthat corner to get

to the Kaufmann Building where
their doctors" practice.

I am sure that Ms. Ana‘

Guzman [vice chancellor ‘for
Facilities Management] is cor-
rect in her assertions that the

~University has complied with the

report of a consulting team and
City of Pittsburgh regulations.
However, compliance is not the
issue. Our University needs to go
beyond the minimum required
by regulators and create a safe
intersection. ‘
Reminding pedestrians
and drivers to be careful is_not
enough. Changes in how that
traffic light is regulated are
needed, at the very least.

Anthony Silvestre '

Associate Professor

_ of Public Health
Fred Reginella, director; Depart-
ment of Engineering and ~ Con-

struction, City of Pittsburgh,

replies: _

Complaints regarding pedes-
trian safety in the Oakland -area
have always been plentiful, and
this intersection over the years
has received more than its share
of attention. Ithas always been
a less-than—ideal crossing for
pedestrians, principally because
of its geometry. '

Lately it has received a lot of
publicity, all of it adverse. Admit-
tedly, safetyissues do exist, and rest
assured that we’re doing every-
thing in our power to mitigate
prevailing hazards.

The situation has been exac-
erbated by the advent of the
construction activities related
to the University of Pittsburgh’s

 

Biomedical Science Tower 3 proj-
ect. The construction has made
it necessary to alter temporarily
the crosswalk patterns formerly
in use. The current patterns have
contributed to the degradation of
pedestrian safety.

It has been suggested that
the installation of an exclusive
pedestrian phase, whereby all
vehicular trafﬁc comes to a halt
for a matter of 20 seconds or so,

could ‘provide ‘a solution. From 
. a trafﬁc*“‘éIrgineering"poii‘it" of

view, this option is unacceptable
because of the mammoth con-
gestion that would undoubtedly
develop. This begs the following
question: Doesn’t pedestrian
safety merit more consideration
than trafﬁc efficiency? Traffic
engineers are always concerned
about safety, for pedestrians and
motorists alike. They are always
performing a tricky balancing act,
continuously having to struggle
with safety on one hand and efﬁ—
ciency on the other. Each situation
requires speciﬁc considerations.
So this becomes a matter of what
to do at this particular location, at
least for as long as the construction
continues. At the conclusion of
these activities, everything would
return to “normal.” , ' ‘
VVhen the project was ﬁrst
identiﬁed, the. City instru'cte'd
the University to,procur’e the
services of a ﬁrm, competent
in trafﬁc engineering, to_ pre-
pare trafﬁc control plans to be
deployed for the construction
period. The University complied,

‘and the consultant proposed the

arrangement, currently in place.
While the City may have had
some misgivings about the pro-
posed plan, it went» along with it

. because one never knows whether

the proposed controls are safe and
effective until they are put to the
test. It developed that the initial
arrangement was problematic,
at the very least, and arguably,
greater protection needed to be
provided for the pedestrians.
The City has been working
with both the contractor and
the University to come up with a
modiﬁed trafﬁc control plan that
wouldtenhance pedestrian safety.
Both the contractor and the Uni-
versity have been most coopera-
tive. Afterproblems with the ini-

“He was the best boss anyone
could have,” Malicki said. “He
was a little bit of a free spirit, but
for Mike, Pitt was it. He’d sleep,
eat and drink Pitt.”

Reich said, “He wasn’t just‘
a boss, he was a friend, because '

he cared about your personal life,
and not just every so often. He
was always asking how things
were going. If you had a problem
he was always willing to talk it
through. He was always available.
Just a great guy in general.”
Friends said Orosz was a
diehard Panthers‘ football and
basketball fan active in the Pitt
Alumni Association, who had a
“Hail to Pitt” tattoo and bumper
sticker. “Pitt staff and faculty from

1 across the Oakland campus -have

been treated to his legendary
hospitality at pre—game tailgate
parties and road trips to away
contests,” Howe said.

Orosz was a Homestead

the contractor to post a “no turn

.on red” sign for trafﬁc coming

down Darragh Street onto Fifth
Avenue. This movement was
interfering with pedestrians in
the crosswalk. Weialso directed

the trafﬁc signal.to be modiﬁed :

to provide an advance pedestrian
phase. This enables pedestrians
to “take possession of” the cross-
walk_ in advance of any vehicular
movements. However, in spite
of these reﬁnements, pedestrian
safety remains an issue.

‘It ‘ sis“ impbiftahti  --

mind that theintersection is
under the jurisdiction of the
contractor as long as constr11c—
tion activities (trafﬁc in and out
of the construction site) continue.
The contractor, having modiﬁed
the signal tocater to or address
his needs, is held accountable

by the City, for the operation of N

the intersection, and, therefore,
bears all responsibilities in this

native and graduate of Bishop
Boyle High School. Following
his graduation from Pitt’s Col-
lege of General Studies (CGS)
in December -1989, he held a
number of positions in Facilities
Management before coming to
Arts and Sciences in June 1998.
In 2002, he received the Arts and
Sciences Distinguished Perfor-
mance Award for staff.

Orosz is survived by his wife,

Marybeth; his parents, Louis and '

Rita M. ofWest Homestead, who
both are retired Pitt employees;
a brother (and CGS graduate),
Gary of South Park, and uncles
and aunts, including Loretta
Shabatura, a staff member in

In ' our continuing effort at

RODS: Pi'I.'I: program, not UPIVIC

To the editor:

A story in the Sept. 25 Uni-
versity Times included a factual"
error about the Real-time Out-

break and"Disease Surveillance.

(RODS) program. The story
incorrectly reported that RODS
is “a UPMC bioterrorism pre-
paredness program,” whereas, in
fact, RODS is’a program of the
University of Pittsburgh.

It is understandable that the
Times made this error, as the
information for the story came
from a UPMC News Bureau
press release that had incorrectly
identiﬁed RODS as a program
of UPMC. ‘See release at:.http:
//newsbureau.upmc.com/PDF/
UPMCBioTerror.pdf‘ ‘ V

Pitt faculty members began
developing RODS in ‘1999. For
the 2002 VVinter Olympics,-these
researchers collaborated with col-

. leagues in Utah to deploy RODS
for monitoring. President Bush '

visited I Pittsburgh three days
before the ‘opening ceremonies
for the Utah games in large part
because of that project. (I had the
privilege of giving the president a
live demonstration of the system
at that time.)

Recently, Pitt released the
RODS system for free under the

‘ GNU‘General Public License.

See: openrods.sourceforge.net

‘\-

The RODS laboratory col-
laborates with many health sys-
tems throughout Pennsylvania,
including the UPMC Health
System. The factual error in the

‘ UPMC press release and, thus

the Times story could’ lead to
misunderstandings among these
collaborators, who are ready to
provide assistance to an inde-

pendent, impartial entity’ based,

at the University of Pittsburgh.
for the public’s good, but not to
‘another health system with which

The Universit'yofPittsburgh’s
RODS Laboratory also created
the National. Retail Data Moni-
tor, an enormous project that

over—the-counter health care
products for early signs of disease
outbreaks. That system collects

On TEACHING

 

ome jerk lights a squib and
Sthrows it into a crowded

marketplace. (A, “squib”
being a crude precursor o.f an
M-80, the kind of ﬁrecracker that
can blind, burn or deafen.)

A guyin the crowd catches the
squib, sees its sizzling fuse and
tosses it into the air, hot potato-
like. Several more people juggle
and volley the squib until, inevi-
tably, it explodes and hurts some-
body — who ﬁles a lawsuit.

But who should be liable for
paying damages? The jerk who
threw the explosive into the
crowd? Or the person who last
touched it before it blew up and
injured the plaintiff?

Such was the basis of Scott V.
Shepherd, a.k.a. the Squib Case
of 1773. » V

“If you don’t know about the
Squib Case, you really haven’t
been to law school,” Elena A.
Baylis tells the ﬁrst-year Pitt law
students in her torts class.

-It was a landmark case in
English tort law, Baylis explains,
because the court ruled, for the
first time, that adefendant could
be held responsible not just for
“direct actions” (personally
assaulting somebody, for exam-

. .,..:_,f13.l.,e)-_l;u§aJ5Q.—7‘£0nti1J11ingactiens” 
resulting from an initial act such

as throwing a dangerous explosive
into a crowd of people.

“But that creates another
problem, right?” Baylis asks her
students. “VVhere do we decide
that these continuing actions
stop?” . . .
Baylis poses the question with
the enthusiasm of a reality—TV
junkie wondering aloud who’s
going to nail the millionaire
bachelor or get thrown off the
tropical island.

Torts (“when things go wrong
and somebody sues somebody

else, who then has to pay,” as

Baylis colloquially deﬁnes them
outside ‘of class) are a required
part of every law schools cur-

~ riculum and can be dreary stuff.

But Baylis d‘oesn’t view torts
that way. *

. “A torts course can be a lot of
fun to teach because it’s_ all about
these strange cases,” she ‘ says.
“The weirdest things happen,
the most peculiar accidents.”

Baylis, “Who joined the Pitt
law faculty this fall, clearly loves

teaching: shaking the dust off

centuries-old legal cases, crafting
Socratic questions that encourage
students to think for themselves,
intentionally presenting weak
arguments to goad students into
challenging her and honing their
analytic skills. :

c So, it’s surprising to learn that
it wasn’t until» Baylis traveled to

_ Ethiopia lastyear that she decided

she wanted to become an acade-
mician at all.
' C!
A 1998 graduate of Yale Law

_ School, Baylis clerked for a U.S.
District Court judge in Los,

Angeles and worked for Shea.
& Gardner in Washington,

D.C., handling international
law andcivil litigation matters.
But she grew tired of working
on litigation rather than gaining
ﬁrst-hand knowledge of other
countries’ legal systems, her
chief professional and academic
interest.

Baylis half—heartedly began
interviewing for faculty jobstwo
years ago, just to explore univer-
sity work as a career option. After

. the first couple of interviews,

though, she decided that she

wanted to do international law

— ideally, immersing herself in
a foreign legal culture — before_

settling down as a professor, so
she dropped out of the interview-
ing process. —

But Baylis’s name remained on
the national list of candidates for
faculty positions. So, when the
University of Alabama’s law
school went searching for possi-
ble participants in a collaborative
program with a new law school
in Ethiopia, Alabama contacted
Baylis.

“It was a chance

to go someplace
that I knew next to
nothing about and
learn aboutawhole

Baylis recalls. “I
‘decided that this
was the chance I’d
been waiting for.”

Arriving in
February 2002'
in the northern‘
provincial capital
of Mekelle, a city
of 150,000 where
donkey carts jostle
for , space in the
streets -with cars
and buses, Baylis I
encountered a
legal system very
different from,
that of the United
States. Ethiopia is
a civil law country
where the system is
based on statutes and regulations,
in contrast to American law (and
U.S._ legal education) which focus
on cases and court decisions. .

Another cultural difference:
VVhile stu- dents in American

law schools expect to be grilled in ,
class, Ethiopians are accustomed ,

to silently taking notes while pro-
A fessors lecture.
“Here at Pitt, I lecture occa-
sionally but mainly the students
are expected to provide the infor-
mation in class, based on the sub-
_ject and their assigned reading,”
Baylis says. “I’m always challeng-
ing-them and encouraging them
to challenge me, so it leads to a less
deferenti.al atmosphere than you
would see in a typical Ethiopian
classroom.” ‘ A
Baylis strove to make her
classes in Mekelle atypical. “At
ﬁrst, the students there were

reluctant to answer questions,”

she recalls. “On the other hand,
they were very enthusiastic about
debating and giving their opin-

ions about the subject matter,
especially in my constitutional
law course, which focused on
human rights provisions of the
Ethiopian constitution. Students

-got into the most amazing argu-

ments, largely, I think, because

- the classroom provided a neutral

setting so the discussion wasn’t
perceived as being personal or
political.” '

‘Prior to her Ethiopian

experience, Baylis says, “I knew"

enough about teaching to know
that I didn’t hate it. But once I

got up in front of those students ~

in Mekelle, I’ realized that I
loved that interplay in the class-
room.”

Baylis was keenly aware that

the 6_5 students in her two courses

would, soon after graduating,
represent a large proportion of
all the lawyers and judges in
Ethiopia, a country that-has been
struggling since 1991 to build a
democracy from the ashes of a
failed socialist regime.

“No matter what you think

about lawyers, there are just not

enough of them in Ethiopia to
go around,” Baylis says. “Before
Mekelle’s law school opened,
there had been only one other
law school in the entire country.
That school had been around for
about 40 years and was produc-
ing about 65 graduates a year in
a country of 65 million.

“In the United States, a lot of
people would be happy to take all

in a place where there is actually
an urgent need for lawyers.” '

‘ While in Ethiopia, Baylis
interviewed judges and other
government ofﬁcials about the
country’s reforms. This work cul-
minated in an interview with the
president of Ethiopia’s supreme
court (recently published in The
Green Bag, an independent legal
journal) and a second article, still
in draft form, proposing a quasi-
legal system for resolving ethnic

conﬂicts, adopted from a system

being tried out in Ethiopia.

Last spring, Pitt was look-
ing for a junior faculty member
who specialized in international
comparative law, and Baylis by
then was searching for just such
a position. She had heard good
things about Pitt’s law school but
didn’t have high expectations
about.Pittsburgh when she ﬂew
here last December for her job
interview.

Although her father had been
born in Wilkinsburg and one of
her grandmothers was from
Forest Hills, Baylis had grown up
inMichigan and knew little about
Pittsburgh except the old stories
about steel mills and darkness—at—
noon. Driving from the airport
toward Downtown,‘ she noticed
little but the traffic—clogged
Parkway West, billboards and
non—descript trees. ’

“Then I drove through the
Fort Pitt Tunnel,” Baylis recalls,
beaming, “and suddenly the View

are constantly winning teaching
awards. I’m sort of biding my
time before I ask if I can sit in
on their classes.”

VVhen she does, Baylis may be
careful to clarifythat she’s a fellow
professor. Even wearing a black
power-suit, the petite, 31-year-
old Baylis looks younger than
some ofher own students, and a
few ofher older colleagues have
mistaken her for one. “Ofcourse,
I’m old enough now to apprecitzte
being mistaken for a student,” she
says, with a laugh. ‘

Baylis is creating two new
courses that she plans to teach
next term: “Crimes Against
Humanity” and “Compara-
tive Law: New Democracies in
Transition.”

The former, a seminar for a
dozen students, will examine the
successes and failures of tribunals
ranging from the Nuremberg
Trials of Nazi leaders, to the
ongoing international criminal
tribunal for ethnic cleansing
crimes in the former Yugoslavia,

“I've walked into a situation
with Dun‘t—:n tii€i"iT0t”S‘, with
some fantastic scholars and
teachers. The professors
here are constantly winning

teaching awards. I'm sort
of biding my time before I
ask if I can sit in on their
classes.''

was just—— spectacular. I had been
envisioning some rambling steel
town but this was so beautiful,
with these amazing hills and
bridges and rivers.” .

_ And then Baylis reached
Oakland and beheld....the sky-

scraper main building ofMoscow

State University. Or at least, to '

her, that’s what the Cathedral of
Learning eerily resembled. (As
an undergraduate, Baylis had
participated in two study-abroad
programs at Moscow State.)

‘ “I thought I was having some
bizarre, sleep-deprivation hal-
lucination!” jokes Baylis, whose
office affords a splendid View of
the Cathedral. _

:1 _ .

Joining the law faculty here
“was great for me because Pitt
has a very sophisticated program”
in international and comparative
law, Baylis says. “I’ve walked into
a situation with built-in mentors,
with some fantastic scholars and

.teachers. The professors here

ation” commissions (emphasizing
reconciliation of enemies rather
than criminal punishment) that

have functioned in -Argentina,’

Rwanda and South Africa.

Part of this course will “deal
with America’s ambivalence
toward international law. “The
United States has a history of
being very much in favor of inter-
national courts and tribunals, and
international treaties and conven-
tions —— until the time comes to
sign them or participate,” Baylis
points out.

“We don’t want to be bound
by international rules,” yet often
it’s been America that-has served
as the cop hauling defendants
into international courts, Baylis
notes. “In the case of Yugoslavian
ethnic cleansing, for example, it
was threats to cut off U.S. aid that
eventually convinced Yugoslavia
to disgorge its defendants,” she
says.  ’

itt-Bradford’s new presi-
dent hit the ground run-
ning.

Ofﬁcially installed as Brad-
ford’s third president Oct. 2 at the
campus’s 40th year anniversary
alumni and family weekend, Liv-
ingston Alexander actually took
over his duties Aug. 1. Already,
the task force he appointed of
Pitt-Bradford stakeholders has
made recommendations for the
college’s future, including how
to improve student retention,
recruitment and diversity, and
strategies to increase revenue.

In a phone interview with
the University Times, Alexan-
der discussed some of his goals
and strategies for the campus,
which he said have been worked
out through. a consensus—build-
ing process offaculty, staff and
campus administrators.

“First ofall, it’s important to
note that we’re on solid ground
ﬁnancially and, especially, with

our academic programs, which ,

are the most important, thing
we do here. We have the larg-
est freshman class in our history
and we’re very close to our 1,500
student enrollment goal,” Alex-
ander said last week. “We’re in
good shape with our campus
facilities and we can draw on the
extensive University resources in
Pittsburgh, with the support of
the provost and the administra-
tion, with whom we have a strong
relationship. .
“But that doesn’t mean there
aren’t a number ofchallenges we

face,” including counteracting.

dwindling state and other reve-
nue streams and apoor economy,_
especially in the Bradford region,
from where most UPB students
are drawn. ,

Following
meetings with faculty, staff and
administrators, Alexander asked a
task force to assess thestatus quo
with an eye toward identifying
strategic plans.

“This is an abbreviated plan,”
he said. “It’s not process-driven
at this point. VVhile process is
important, this group is identi-
fying the basic elements to reach
a consensus on how we should
shape our future —- to create a
vision, ifyou will.”

In the coming weeks, Alexan-
der expects to hold an open forum
on the plan to gather student and
community input, _followed by a
review of the basic outline by the
Pitt-Bradford advisory board.

The plan’s components
include: r '

* Reviewing and possibly
restructuring academic areas,
for “programmatic coherence,”
Alexander said. ”Right now, I
can’t predict how these things will
go. Butl think there are areas that

need to be re-organized.”
° Creating amechanism to

introductory ’

secure more grant money from
external sources. “We’re looking
to establish a program to generate
other revenue streams, drawing
first on the advice and resources
of the Provost’s ofﬁce, and using
some outside consultants in fund-
raising, grant-writing, encour-
aging entrepreneurs and other
strategies. In short, we have to
be creative,” Alexander said. ‘.‘Of
course, eventually we’ve got to
do it on our own, but we’re look-
ing for ways to support faeulty’s
efforts [to generate revenue].
There’s no single panacea, but
this is the direction we have to
pursue.” A _
° Focusing onstudent reten-
tion and "recruitment. “We’ve

made strides in recruitment. To
‘sustain our student population,

for one thing we will need more
residence halls,” the new presi-
dent said. “We’ve got two in the
design phase now, and we will be
able to increase our beds from5 54
to about 800 for fall 2005.”

bilities. “A key, component here
is asking’ all of us to be aware of
the fact that we need to deﬁne
our roles,” Alexander said.
“VVhile there is a consensus on
this, we’re not clear on the ‘how’
yet,” he said. ' 7

“Our staff is overworked, ,

overwhelmed and stretched,
and it’s asking a lot for them to
expand their responsibilities. But
our efforts'can’t fall only on the
admissions staff. Also important
is how we all greet students; how
accessible we are; how much assis-
tance we lend. We also might look
to having faculty go out into the
high schools, or go to [current]

students themselves‘ [to help .

recruit]

° Expanding educational
resources to individuals in the
region who can’t afford the
cost. “We’re looking at this, but
I have to feel comfortable that this
is right for our campus,” Alex-
ander pointed out. He said the
idea stems from his experience
as a higher education adminis-
trator in Kentucky, where there
is a regional initiative at Berea
College to provide low-cost and

77

, free education directed toward

labor preparation to qualiﬁed
children of native Appalachians
and descendants of freed slaves.
“I’m looking for ways to adapt
that idea to our region’s poor,”
Alexander said. “A program
like this might intermingle with
ﬁnancial aid packages, but clearly
those [existing] packages will not
cover the total cost. As with any
new idea, whatl expect is to look
at it carefully, assess its feasibility,
look at the pitfalls before making
any commitments. But no one
here has felt this proposal was
out of place,” he said, because
of Pitt-Bradford’s long-stand-

“Bradford’s economic prob-
lems are more severe thanin other
,parts of the state,” Alexander said.
“But the area has embraced the
institution throughout its history,
and this regional collegiality is
an important ﬁrst step: to talk
about ‘these problems together
and build collaboration with
our neighbors.”

“We alreadyhave students outside

Alexander said the most

Pitt-Bradford: ‘We havearrived’ I

1th 27 years on staff
at Pitt—Bradford, Jim
Evans has seen some
ups and downs in the campus’s

40-year history. The baby boom '

generation. and Pitt’s, desire-' to
strengthen its upper division
classes on the Pittsburgh campus
initially gave feeder campus
Pitt-Bradford a steady increase
in students. _

But the declining population
and industry closings in the late
1970s and into the ’80s threat-

ened the college’s -existence.‘

Today, the college is on
ﬁrm ground, he said. “I think
the drive of [former Bradford
president] Dick McDowell had
a direct effect on not only having
our campus survive, but thrive,”
Evans said. “His work with the
commonwealth and with Pitts-
burgh [administrators] and the
College of General Studies and
[Bradford] community leaders
and businesses really saved the
college,” Evans said.

Pitt-Bradford’s watershed
year was 1979, Evans said, when

Pitt-Bradford began to confer.

baccalaureate‘ degrees.
“But even though that was
‘critical to our institutional his-
tory, allowing us todevelop the
physical campus and especially to
recruit and establish an excellent
faculty to deliver the programs,
I think it really took 12-15 more
years until we could say, ‘Wehave
arrived,”’ Evans said.
As vice president and clean of
Student Affairs, Evans oversees

residential life and housing,
career services, student activi-

ties, health services, admissions,’

ﬁnancial aid, counseling services

and athletics and recreational

sports. .

Comparing Pitt-Bradford’s
early years with today, Evans
said, ‘fOur primary recruiting
area is still the six—county area,
where we’re the only four—year

college, and many of our regional .

students are still the ﬁrst in their
families to goto college. We still
have students in our engineer-
‘ing and pharmacy programs
who go here two years and then
make application to Pittsburgh,”
Evans said. “On the other hand,
we have a huge increase in stu-
dents who come here not to
transfer but because we’re their
ﬁrst choice.” A

An underratedfactor in
Bradford’s growth, Evans said,
was increasing. its athletic com-
petitiveness. “In ‘the early years,
we competed with junior colleges,
but in 1979 —— there’s that year
again — we entered NAIA (the

National Association of Intercol- .

legiate Athletics) in a few sports.

But we got stronger and stronger '

through the ’80s.”

“In 1993, Pitt-Bradford went
up to NCAA Division III com-
petition, which fl.1I‘tl‘1’€I"SpaI‘l{Cd
more involvement by students
and a corresponding athletics

- facilities upgrade and more

recognition for Pitt-Bradford.
“Recognition and success in

athletics helps recruitment,”

said‘ Evans.

Despite enrollment growth
and campus facilities expansion,
Pitt-Bradford retains its s-mall-
campus feel, Evans. said. “We’re
a perfect place for students who

i want a quality liberal arts edu-
cation from a committed faculty
without a big-city environment.”
Recruits are usually im—pressed
with the campus, Evans said,
especially with new facilities
such as .the Frame-Westerberg
Commons student center, which
Evans described as “one of the

' ﬁnest student centers to be found
anywhere.”

In addition, a symbiotic rela-
tionship with the Bradford region
is a strength in recruiting. “Town-
and-gown relationships are very,

1 important here. -.Many of our
facilities were funded_in part or
all  private fuI_1ding,” he said.

“And on ourpartrthe com-
munity in the summer-mon-this

uses our outdoor athletic ﬁelds ‘
extensively; we have camps r

and conferences. Our Bridges
Program has scholarships for 30
students from ..Bradford High
School,” Evans said.

Asked why" he has ‘stayed at"

Bradford through thick and thin,

Evans said a personal turning_

point came in his ﬁrst year. “Don,
Swarts, who had retired by then
(as Bradford’s president), told me:
‘You have the most importantjob
in the college, to serve the stu-

' dents,”’ Evans recalled. “I took

him at his word and have loved
working here ever since.” I

A Bradford campus timeline

 

n 1962, Raymond N. Zoerkler, a Bradford geologist with the

Hanley and Bird Company, Robert Cole, Bradford Hospitals

chief administrator, and others, petitioned Pitt to open a regional
campus in the Bradford area.

That fall, then—Pitt Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, following
a feasibility study, announced that the University would expand its
reach into the western and north—central regions of Pennsylvania
by establishing three new regional campuses to serve as two-year
“feeder schools” to the Pittsburgh campus and to complement the
Johnstown regional campus, which was founded in 1927.

The move was largely motivated by the expectation of baby boom-
ers reaching college age and taxing Pitt’s ability to handle the influx.
A secondary consideration was competition with Penn State, which
was expanding its regional reach at about the same time.

In 1963, Pitt opened the regionals in Bradford, Greensburg and
Titusville~ (See University Times/lug. 28.), which are planning events
this year to celebrate their 40th anniversaries.

Following are some major points in th_e'Bradford campus’s insti-
tutional history.

Litchﬁeld named Donald E. Swarts, then dean of Pitt—]ohnstown,
as the ﬁrst Bradford campus president.].B. Fisher, president of Ken-

dall Reﬁning, was named the ﬁrst chairman of the advisory board.

Swarts began recruiting a faculty.

Individuals andorganizations in Bradford and surrounding regions
contributed $758,000 toward Pitt-Bradford’s founding.

During summer 1963, Pitt—Bradford purchased Hampsher House
from Bradford Hospital, converting it into classrooms, laboratories,
a library and student lounges.

The newly established campus began as a feeder college that
offered the ﬁrst two "years of a Pitt undergraduate education. The
ﬁrst class included 143 full~time and 145 part—time students.

By 1964, the student body had swelled to 380 full—time and 100
part—time students. To help accommodate expansion, the campus
purchased the l25—room Emery Hotel on Main Street in Bradford
to provide the campus’s ﬁrst student housing.

In l967,_I.B. Fisher announced that VVitco—Kendall Corp. would
donate 78 acres of land on the site,of the former Harri Emery Air-
port for the construction of a campus. At the same time, the City
of Bradford and Bradford Township announced they would make a

33—acre parcel of adjacent land available to Pitt—Bradford for devel— 

oprnent as 8. f€Cf€21tlOI1 area.

In theear1yv1970s, Pitt—Bradford sctits sights on c'o‘ns‘t1'uctingthe - - ~
campus and moving its academic focus from two-year to four—year V

programming. The college used the $1.5 million in regional private
monies it was able to raise to “seed” nearly $14 million’s worth of
capital projects, including the construction of two academic build-
ings: Swarts Hall and Fisher Hall.

Over the next two decades, the campus added other facilities
including a residence hall complex, a sports center, outdoor recre-
ational and athletic ﬁelds and a student union.

Under the leadership of Bradford’s second president, Richard
E. McDowell, who at age 29 was the youngest college president in
the country in 1973, the campus began offering four—year programs.
(McDowell served as president until 2002.)

The ﬁrst degree program (A.S. in petroleum technology, 1975)
was followed in 1979 with the designation ofbaccalaureatc degree-
granting status. .

Due in large part to a Title III grant, Pitt—Bradford added a
signiﬁcant number of bachelor’s—level programs beginning in 1985:
biology, computer science, geology, history/ political science, chem-
istry, economics, psychology, mathematics and communication.

In 1988, the campus opened the T. Edward and Tullah Hanley
Library, named in appreciation of a $1.2 million gift from artist and
‘philanthropist Tullah Hanley. I

Campus expansion got another boost in 1995 when the college’s
Campaign 2000 raised more than $10 million, surpassing its goal
by more than 25 percent. A major factor in the campaign’s success
was the Blaisdell family of Bradford, owners of Zippo Manufactur-
ing. Their dollar—for-dollar matching gift program for the college’s

‘ﬁne and performing arts building project accounted for nearly $3 .5 V

million.

Today, the campus offers 26 baccalaureate degrees and 12 profes-
sional programs of study. Students also can choose from 37 minors,
two associate degrees, credential programs in education and nursing,
and a number of one-year certiﬁcate programs. 1

UPB has 22 buildings on 170 -acres, more than 1,300 enrolled
students and over 5,500 alumni. Pitt—Bradford also boasts an endow-
ment of $20 million. ',

Last week the campus celebrated its 40th anniversary on alumni
and familyweekend. Events included the opening of Blaisdell Hall,
the new communications arts and ﬁne arts building, which adds 1.8,500
sq. ft. to the campus at a cost of $4.5 million, and the dedication of

0 the Frame-Westerberg Co_mmons, its student center, a $9.5 million

expansionand renovation project. ‘

Pitt—Bradford also installed formallyits third president, Livingston
Alexander, former provost and vice president for Academic Affairs
at Kean University in New Jersey, who follows Donald Swarts and
Richard McDowell. (Vi/"illiam Shields served as interim president
following McDowell.) I

 

UNIVERSITY TIMES

itt’s 2003 United Way
Pfund-raising campaign

will kick off Oct. 15 and
run through Dec. 31. A

Last year, the University
collected $679,946. Faculty and
staff pledged $560,102; students
pledged $98,391; retirees con-
tributed $18,629, and special
events brought in $2,824.

Pitt’s 2002 overall campaign
and the Pitt retirees campaign
each received Silver Awards from
United Way for achieving a per

person gift in the $50-$99 range.
The overall participation rate last
year was 27 percent, with 2,710
givers pledgingdonations.

As in past years, donors can
direct all or a portion of their
donation to an unrestricted fund
(called the Impact Fund) or to
a speciﬁc United Way afﬁliated
group, including 5 3 such eligible
groups at Pitt.

But this year, United Way

of Allegheny County is chang-'

ing its fund-raising strategy by

Pitt to kick off United Way drive

withholding 15 percent of dona-
tions to offset operating costs. In
prior years, a small ﬂat fee was
withheld from designated gifts,
while overhead costs came from
unrestricted gifts.

(See sidebar on this page.)

Last year, Pitt raised $2 40,000.
for the Impact Fund. The Uni-
versity hopes to increase that by
at least 10 percent, with an Impact
Fund goal of $265,000.

“Since the Impact Fund is
the major emphasis this year

and because of the importance
of increasing funds to it, our focus
will be on the Impact Fund and
the Impact Fund goal,” said
Jean McDonough, assistant to

the Pitt—United Way campaign '

manager. “While we hope staff
and faculty will continue to be
generous in their giving, we have

not set any other dollar goals.”

Overhead fee for designated contributions hiked  

his year, United Way
of Allegheny County is
changing its fund—rais—

ing strategy “to restore parity
in overhead support” which,

indirectly, will increase funding‘

for unrestricted gifts, according
to United Way spokesperson Bob
De Witt. ,

“United Way will make addi-
tional dollars available to address
critical needs by ensuring that the
cost of operating the organization
is proportionately shared by all
donors and agencies,” De VV1tt
said in an Aug. 19 prepared state-
ment. ”There will be a charge on
all gifts at the rate reflecting the
overhead of United Way, cur-
rently 15 percent.”

In prior, years, the brunt of
overhead costs has been borne by
the non—proﬁt agency’s general
fund of unrestricted gifts (now
called the Impact Fund), while
a flat fee per designated gift ($6
last year) was charged to cover
processing costs on those gifts,
according to the United Way.

The new strategy is expected
to bolster by$1 .5 million the two-
year-old Impact Fund, a pool of
unrestricted contributions allo-
cated to the 71 partner agencies
deemed by United Way to deliver
measurable results in improving
the quality of life in the county.
These partner agencies fall into
six areas: children and families;
health and mental health; seniors;

housing; neighborhoods, and
workforce development.

United Way met its overall
2002 campaign goal of raising

6

$39 million, but for the fourth
time in ﬁve years, allocations to
United Way’s partner agencies

declined. In 2002, the Impact

Fund garnered $19.7 million, a
drop of 26 percent over the past
three years, for those agencies,
accordinigﬁto De Witt.

' In 2001, designated gifts,
ﬁrst introduced in 1982, over-
took unrestricted donations for
the ﬁrst time. Prior to 1982,
United Way (and predecessor
organizations) committees allo-
cated funds.

“United Way allocates
[Impact] funds based on its
assessment of agency manage-
ment effectiveness, program
results and prioritization of criti-
cal needs,” De Witt said. Local
volunteer experts who serve on

sixUnited Way Impact Councils,

provide guidance for this task.
De Witt added that United

Way expects to lower its over-

head costs to 10 percent in

future years by moving pledge‘

processing from a paper—based to
an on—line system; by outsourc-
ing non—core operations such
as information technology, and
through strategic. alliances, such
as the United Way’s partnership
with Robert Morris University,
which is expected to enhance
the management effectiveness
and oversight of participating
agencies.

Pitt’s United Way campaign
steering committee supports the
new strategy, said campaign co-

chair G. Reynolds Clark.

-“It’s too early to tell whatthe
effect, if any, will be on giving”

(with this change in approach,

Clark said. “But -we "believe
in the philosophy behind‘ the,
change. As a cooperative part-
nership, we all should share in
the operating costs. We’re all
in this together, so I_look at this
from a positive standpoint. We’re
asking our people here to‘ con-

sider giving to the Impact Fund, ‘
T which beneﬁts many needy and

worthy charities.” .
Clark, who has been vol-
unteering for United Way for

1 many years, said that the origi— _

nal thinking behind promoting
designated gifts in 1982 was to
build the total amount of dollars
raised. “And there was a surge of
giving in the late ’80s and into the

’90s. It also allowed the agencies_ V

themselves to be more proactive
in their fund—raising [by touting
their individual services]. So it
had a positive effect, including

in giving from the corporate -
Marc Lukasiac told the Univer-“ -

community,” he said.

“We think the United Way
is‘ still the best way to help the
whole community. We also need
to appreciate the efforts United
Wayis making to lower its overall
operating costs,” Clark added.

But not all area organiza-
tions are as supportive of the
new United Way strategy. In a
memo obtained by the Univer-
sity Times, Children’s Hospital
of Pittsburgh President and
CEO Ronald L. Violi urged all
the hospital’s employees to bypass
the United Way and give directly

to ainew Children’s “Reach Out
to Kids” internal campaign.
' ’ “We are encouraging employ-

‘ ees to make contributions directly .

to Children’s through the Reach
Out to Kids instead of using
United Way as a conduit for
their donations to the hospi-
tal,”iV1oli wrote in the Sept. 4
memo. “That’s because this year
the United Way is assessing a 15;

percent fee on contributions such

‘ as those designating Children’s as

the intended beneﬁciary. That’s
why staging our own fund-raising
campaign makes sense and will
preventthe loss of potentially
thousands of dollars to United
Way’s new fee.” I _
.V1oli added that the Reach Out

H to Kids target goal is $1 10,000,

and that “every dollar will go to
Children’s Hospital.”

Violi also wrote that United
Way pledge cards would be made
available to those who wished to
give to the United Way.
Children’s spokesperson

sity Times that as of Oct. 1 the
internal campaign had raised
$97,000.. He“ said ﬁnal numbers
for the campaign, which ended
Oct. 3, will not _be available
for several weeks. “But we feel
conﬁdent that ..we’ll_ reach our
$110,000 goal. The response
has been good,” Lukasiac said.
“And Mr. Violi made it clear in
the memo that [the internal cam-
paign] is optional and employees
still have the option to give to the

‘United Way if they want.”

“This disconnect between

prompted endless charges of
hypocrisy and irrationality,” said
historian David T. Courtwright,
who cited the drug-damage com-
parisons in a Sept. 2 5 lecture here,

“Forces of Habit: VVhy We Make I B

War On Some Drugs But Not
On Others.” "

“I’m not here to give a speech
or sermon deploring this,” said
Courtwright, whose four books
on the history and politics -of

drugs have been published by

the Harvard and University of

‘Tennessee presses. , -

ture — focused on how and why

some psychoac ea drugs ~c'arn_e

thriveYleg’ally.

For one thing, size mattersin
drug policy. “The most obvious.
reason for alcohol’s privileged
status is that it’s simply such
a large industry,” Courtwright
noted. L .

Viticulture, brewing and dis-

” tilling have ﬂourished through-

out the non-Islamic world for

centuries, supporting families '

and ﬁlling government coffers
with tax revenue. Atvthe turn of

. the 20th ‘century, Courtwright

pointed out, the incomes of 13
percent of France’s labor force
were tied to the production of
alcoholic beverages.

Similarly, tobacco has been a
highly proﬁtable crop ever since

Sir Walter Raleigh brought the '

plant back _to England with him

[from Virginia, although the—mas-
~sive-scale manufacture, market-

ing and smoking-of cigarettes
didn’t take off until shortly after
World War I, decades before
scientists would link tobacco and
cancer, Courtwright said.

“If, after the 1964 surgeon

’ general’s report, the government
10f the United States had tried to

prohibit tobacco, that would have
affected 70' million smokers in
this country. Do you think that
was going to happen? No.” ,
Moreover, _tobac_co pro-
duction currently supports an

estimated 100 ‘million families _
' worldwide, he said. .
In contrast, production of nar— .

cotics generally has been concen-
trated in poor and/or colonized
areas of the world, For example,
coca was cultivated almost exclu-
sively in Peru and Java at the
beginning of the 2 0th century and
only a handful of industrialized
nations were producing cocaine

“was to drugs what Saudi Arabia

-is for oil today,” he said. “Ger-

many could. effectively wreck
any international drug control
agreement because the German
manufacturing capacity was
so great. Initially, Germany
resisted effortsto, control the

international trade in drugs like

morphine and cocaine.” )

But then Germany lost the
war, and the-victorious allies
insisted that Germany and its
opium-growing ally, Turkey,
ratify a Hague convention ceding
control of narcotics exports to the
League of Nations.

’ Hitler would pull Germany,
’ out of the League. “But, interest-

ingly, the Nazis were absolutely
scrupulous in honoring their
agreements with respect to
international narcoticsicontrol,”
Courtwright said.

Despite their own abuse

of controlled substances (and-

distribution of Benzedrine to

' German pilotsand tank crews),

Nazi leaders just said “nein” to
drugs for the _German‘volk. :
According to Courtwright,
one -reason that the British
Empire shed its role as the world’s

leading proponent (and beneﬁ-

ciary) of the opium trade was that
Westminster began earning less
and less money from it.

“Why? Because more and.

more of the opium was being
grown in China itself and not
being shipped from [British]
India,” he noted. “I’m not saying
that that was the only reason that

the British’ eventually turned

against the opium trafﬁc, but it
was a majqr factor.”

How did Britain, Germany

and other Western powers get

mixed up with dope in the ﬁrst
place? '
And why did some recre-

ational drugs, but not others,
catch on as global products? '
First, it should be noted that

i all recreational, drugs began as

medicines, Courtwright said.
“Even tobacco, the recreational
drug par excellence, was introduced
to Europeas an exotic‘ medicine
from the'New World,” he said.
It’s only when drugs begin to

be used for non-medical purposes I

that they become controversial,
Courtwright declared.‘ “I would

' say that all large—scale societies .

differentiate between the medi-
cal and the non-medical use of
drugs, and that distinction is the
moral and legal foundation of
the whole international control
system,” he said. . p. »

Courtwright‘ also pointed
out: “Drugs, without exception,
started _off as regional products
for regional consumption.”

For example, coffee (caf-
feine being a psychoactive «drug,
albeit a [mild one) originated
in Ethiopia and spread first to

"Arabia and then to the rest of

the Islamic world. Crusaders
returning from the Holy Land
brought coffee back with them
to Europe. Retreating Ottoman
Turk invaders left behind bags of
coffee beans in their abandoned
encampment outside the gates of
Vienna. Europeans subsequently
began cultivating coffee in the
Americas —_— where, by the end
of the 19th century, 70 percent
of the world’s coffee beans were
being grown.

Meanwhile, other region-
ally popular psychoactive drugs
— kava, khat, betal, peyote
— either had limited shelf lives,
needed very speciﬁc growing
conditions, or clashed with Euro-
pean life styles. (Peyote would
have been sadly out ofplace at a
court ball or on a foxhunt.)

European preference was cru-
cial because, from the 16th to the
18th centuries, only Europeans
had the ships,merchants, terrari-
urns, etc. to’ spread drugs around
the world, Courtwright said.

Europeans traded alcohol
for slaves, furs and other com-

I modities, and induced inebri-

ated indigenous peoples to sign
away their lands. British colonial
administrators and their native
merchant collaborators peddled
so much monopoly-priced opium
to Chinese laborers that, by the

19th century, the opium busi-

ness was siphoning off between

half and two-thirds of those
workers’ wages, according to
Courtwright.

One of the beauties of psycho-
active drugs, prof1t—wise, is that
they are the opposite of dura\)\e

<1 ‘“Y 9kg

you are  you want

to replace that drug quickly and
smoothly.” In addition, as users’
physical tolerance for a drug
grows, they buy more of it.
’ Even “after getting out of
the opium business, the Brit-
ish government by the 1880s
was deriving half of its revenue
from taxes on three psychoactive
substances: alcohol, tobacco and
tea, said Courtwright. During the
same period, taxes on vodka were
ﬁnancing 70 percent of Russia’s
military budget, he added.

“This was the V era before
income taxes,” Courtwright
pointed out.» “States had to
get revenue from somewhere,
and they were getting it from
drugs.” a

4 Cl .

So why did those governments
strangle the geese (certain geese,
anyway) that were laying golden’
eggs?

Or, as Courtwright asked: “If
the swells who run the show are
proﬁting like crazy from drug
commerce, why in the last 100
years or so has there been a global
movement toward restriction and
prohibition of drugs?” ' A

Courtwrightfs one—word
answer: industrialization.

The Industrial Revolution
vastly increased the volume of
psychoactive substances avail-
able, drove down their prices,
introduced‘ modern advertising
and spawned new inventions

(hypodermic syringes, high—-

speed cigarette machines, etc.)
that made it possible toingest
drugs in highly puriﬁedforms.

bearer in Singapore could buy

equivalent of 4 cents, Court-
wright said.

Industrialization also made
factory owners, as well as union
leaders and workers themselves,
much more concerned about
on-the—job sobriety. One slip
or stumble in a steel mill could
be fatal.

“Also, as more work moved
indoors, smoking became more
problematic because the risk of
ﬁre in a factory is much greater,”
said Courtwright.

Concurrently, socialistic
health insurance systems with
third-party payers, such as VV1l-
helmite Germany’s, introduced
the idea that society as a whole
foots the bill when hospital
resources are squandered on

, treating preventable illnesses and

injuries resulting from alcohol-
ism and other addictions.

Also, improved documenta-
tion by epidemiologists, social
workers and other statisticians
raised public awareness of prob-
lems associated with psychoac-
tive drugs. Armed with such data,
Chinese nationalists began work-
ing with Western missionaries to ~
end the opium trade with India,
Courtwrightnoted.

Cl

In determining whether to
ban or merely restrict individual
psychoactive drugs, the following
factors come into play, according
to Courtwright: A

0 Harm to self and _others.

' Even in individualistic nations

such as the United States, where
poisoning one’s body is widely
seen as a God—given right, it’s a
compelling anti-drug argument
to note that “innocent others” are
being harmed.

For centuries, non-smokers
complained that tobacco use
was smelly and ﬁlthy. Since at
least 1964, U.S. scientists and
lawmakers have known that
cigarettes can kill people who
smoke them.

Butthe mass movement to ban
smoking from public places came
only after evidence emerged that
second-hand smoke endangered
non—smokers, Courtwright said.

. A related factor is the alleged
link between violence and cer-
tain recreational drugs,'he added.
“Precisely how drug use causes
violence and to what extent drugs
are actually responsible for vio-
lence are enormously complex
questions and they’ve been
compounded, unfortunately, by
prejudice and propaganda,” said
Courtwright.

“But let me just make this

rugs: Why some, not others

point: Even the perception that
non-medical drug use is tied
into violent crime has important
political consequences that can
lead to prohibition.”

0 Social costs. Obvious
examples include worker absen-
teeism, lost productivity and
tax revenues, and higher costs
for health insurance and public
safety.

Courtwright told the audi-
ence, “Pittsburgh -is a great place
to make this argument: Abusive
drinking is everyone’s business in
a society where a liver transplant
costs around $250,000. It’s not
very persuasive to say, ‘It’s my
liver’ in a world of third—party
payers with high insurance pre-
miums and high taxes.”

Although,

gets tricky when you consider
that moderate drinking may
beneﬁt the heart, and people
who kill themselves with tobacco
may indeed run up big hospital
bills — but they also tend to die
before collecting Medicare and
company pensions. —

0 Religious disapproval.
While hallucinogens ﬁgure into
many tribal religious ceremonies,
the world’s major faiths hold psy-
choactive drugs in suspicion when
not condemning them outright.

“That’s not because major
religions have anything against
transforming consciousness,”
said Courtwright. Quite the
contrary. But major religions see
drugs as lazy, chemical shortcuts
to altered states that should prop-
erly be reached through prayer,
fasting and meditation, he said.

0 Deviant associations.
American prohibitionists have
linked opium with Chinese
workers, alcohol with Catholic
immigrants, heroin with urban
delinquents in the early’ 20th
century, and cocaine with young

African—American men in more.

recent years.

“In every instance,” Court-
wright said, “prohibitive legisla-
tion followed. Notice, please, that
prejudice alone did not cause the
legislation. That’s too simple. But
it does make it easier to enact and
maintain such legislation.

“Generally speaking, the
smaller the target population
[linked with a drug] is, and the
lower its status, the easier it is
to enact such restrictions and
prohibitions.”

Quoting another writer,
Courtwright suggested, that if
Viagra had originated in a clan-
destine, inner—city_ drug lab and

a'dded,'= t evaluating-i»=so‘cial’—’~ costs

had been nicknamed “PartyBoy,”

its possession and use might well

be illegal.

° Group survival. Court-
wright noted that Native Ameri-
can leaders opposed trafﬁcking in
liquor because it threatened their

peoples’ very survival. Similarly,

19th centuryjapanese aristocrats
damned tobacco as the “poverty
plant,” fearing that its cultivation
in Japan would crowd out grain
production and ijnpoverish the
people.

Group survival arguments

are especially potent when
intertwined with concerns about
the ruination of young lives, he
added. _ ‘

vated an (exaggerated) image as a

“Is this the crew,” Court-
wright quipped, “that is going to

have a ‘go’ at alcohol prohibition '

or tobacco restriction?”

outlawed alcoholic beverages.
“Alcohol wasnever, never the

"equivalent of a Schedule 1~con-

trolled substance in this country, ”

drug.” »
Courtwright said one of the
more fascinating documents he’s
come across in his research was a
survey prepared by Harvard Uni-
versity for Class of 1970 alumni
attending their 2 5th reunion.

“I don’t mean to be critical,”
Courtwright commented wryly,
“but this group was, shall we say,
not known for pulmonary abste-
miousness in its college days.”

Responding to the survey’s
questionnaire, 38 percent of the
alumni said they had smoked
regularlyin college. “But 2 5 years
later, only 6 percent smoked at
all, and of that, only 2 percent

smoked more than 20 cigarettes ’

a day,” Courtwright said. _
History shows that when a
country’s elite drop a psychoac-
tive drug, its days as an afford-
able, freely available substance
are numbered, he said. ,

Courtwright forecast a world- '

wide “convergence” of drug
policies over the next 2 5 years as
policy-makers gradually concur
that current sanctions against
some illicit drugs (notably, canna-
bis) are too heavy-handed, while

. public health considerations jus-

tify greater restrictions on alcohol
and tobacco use.
Cl

After his lecture, Courtwright
was asked to comment on the
Bush administration’s stance
that illicit use of opiates and
cocaine is, in effect, bankrolling
terrorism. '

Courtwright replied: “Any

merits will legislate against those
drugs, said Courtwright.

Throughout the 2 0th century,
alcohol and tobacco use were
glamorized by Hollywood stars
(“By 1930, four-ﬁfths of allAmer-
ican ﬁlms depicted at least some
drinking,” Courtwright said)
and reinforced by ‘government
leaders, who historically have
set the tone for non-medicinal
drug use.‘ '

Peter the Great, for exam-
ple, took up smoking in the
West, came home to’Russia and
rescinded his country’s ban on
tobacco. Another tobacco fan-
cier, Pope Benedict XIII, ended
the Roman Catholic .Church’s

said Courtwright. Throughout

the so—called Prohibition years,

he noted, the law permitted lim-
ited home brewing, sacramental’
use of alcohol and the medicinal
prescription of spirits.) ,

Courtwright predicted that
alcohol “is going to weather the
storm” of increasingly restrictive
legislation and taxation better
than cigarettes in the United
States. , .

“One of the‘ reasons that
tobacco is increasingly vulner-
able, quite apart from the mass
of persuasive medical and epide-
miological evidence, is that the

composition of the tobacco-using

population is changing,” he said.
“Tobacco is becoming a loser’s

drug proﬁts to buy weapons and
pay their armies.

“In that sense,” Courtwright
said, “it is literally true that when
a person purchases illicit drugs,

some of that money is going’

to. . .well, if not to terrorists,
then to guerilla armies of some
description. On the other hand,
that cuts both ways” — in that the
Bushadministration seemsto be
turning a blind eye to opiumdeal-_
ing by Afghan war lords whose
“semi-loyalty”. America needs in
propping up the new, pro—West—
ern government in Kabul.

“That kind of hypocrisy is, in A

fact, an old story with deep roots
in the Cold War,” Courtwright

- observed. _ I .

Former  ambassador outlines
problems with current foreign policy

, ven if Americans accept
the premise that the

current United States
“foreign policy of pre—emption”
is sound, at least three of the
policy’s consequences betray
its weakness, said a former U.S.
ambassador.

' Current U.S. foreign policy is
undermined because the United
States is over-extended militar-
ily, the countryis going bankrupt,

and the reputation of America as ~

a beacon of freedom with demo-
cratic principles is rapidly and
vastly deteriorating, according

1, . to Dan Simpson, associate editor
_of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

and former U_.S. ambassador to
the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Somalia and the Central
African Republic.

Simpson spoke Oct. 2 on
“Current Issues in U.S. Foreign
Policy: VVhat Are Our Objectives
Now?” The lecture, part of Inter-
national Week, was co—sponsored
by the global studies program and
the Graduate School 0 of Public
and International Affairs.

Simpson insisted his perspec-
tive-was non—partisan, but he had
few kind words for George W.
Bush’s foreign policies.

“I worked for the State depart— _

ment starting in 1966, under
every president since Lyndon
Johnson,_ and including’ the cur-
rent’ president,” said Simpson,
who retired from State’ in 2001

  

shape and needsa new, hard nick

. —‘ but that’s not to say that we

need a change? in administration,
because I think the suggestions I
would make could be done within
the Context of the policies of ‘the
current administration. Nev-
ertheless, I think we’re on [the

wrong track, and we’re going in _

the wrong direction.”
Simpson said current U. S ..for-

’ eign policy stems from reactions _

to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks. “The concept is that,
given the events of Sept. 11 and
given our power, particularly our
military capability, the US has
the right to act, proactively if
necessary, outside of traditional
international frameworks to I do
what we consider to be in our

V. because of the
deﬁcit spending. Not only did

;security’s interests. Overseas,

we’ve done this in an orderly,
aimed approach” in Afghanistan,
Iraq, the Philippines, Columbia
and the former Soviet state of
Georgia. V

(Simpson noted smaller-scale
examples of this strategy that pre-
dated Sept. ll, such as sending
troops to Colombia to ﬁght drug
lords, but said 9/11 codiﬁed the
policy of pre—emption.)i

“But it is clear that our mili-
tary is overextended. We’ve got

“‘129,000 troops in Iraq, with

another 20,000 support troops
in Kuwait and other surround-
ing areas. We’ve got 10,000
troops in Afghanistan, 37,000 in
South Korea, 5 1 ,000 injapan, and
we’ve hadup to 75,000 recently
in Germany,” Simpson said. -

“It’s a clear military principle
that to calculate the number of
troops you need to sustain any
efforts you multiply by 3, because
of issues of re_placing, re-ﬁtting,
re-training, re-settling active
troops, and so forth. All of this
stuff takes more troops than we
have.” '

Simpson cited, the $5 bil-
lion monthly cost to pay for
continuing U.S. operations in
Iraq and Afghanistan -— with

' no end in sight —- and a current

The crunch in Iraq now is
two—fold, Simpson said: the
ongoing attack on American
soldiers and the growing cost of
rebuilding Iraq, both of which
are eroding the support of the
war at home. ‘

“Well, what do we do? We
can’t just declare victory and-
walk away,” Simpson said. He
suggested three strategies:

1. Reorient foreign policy
to fundamental American prin-
ciples, including respect for
international law and borders
and human rights.

“We’ve put 10,000 Iraqis
in prisons there.,They have no
lawyers. VVhat happened to the
American ideas of justice and due
- process of law? We’ve declared

people in this country enemy
combatants; no habeas corpus.

and they shouldphave represen-

main focus was on Iraq. “The best
argument for the war is that we
haven’t been attacked at home
since Sept. 11," knock on wood.
But are we really safer?”

Simpson said justiﬁcations to
declare war. were weak, includ-
ing the justiﬁcation that U.S.
national security was threatened‘
by Saddam Hussein.

“Not that the Iraqis are pussy- _
cats. Saddam Hussein was really
bad news. But it’s a big jump
from seeing someone we don’t
like to deposing him and turning
a country on its head, especially
when the restpof the world was

“Our foreign policy is not in good shape

and needsa new, hard look — but that’s

current administration.” 0 p

2. Take a more regional
approach. “This is especially‘
true in the North Korea area.
I was encouraged by the recent
talks that involvedjapan, China, -
Russia, South Korea and us.
North Korea’s” neighboring
countries should bear most of
the responsibility,” for keeping
North Korea’s nuclear program
_in check, Simpson said.

“This approach worked in
Liberia. This was obviously a
failed state that was imploding
before our eyes with violence

, and ‘humanitarian problems
bordering on catastrophe.‘ We
brought a few ships there off

° Iraq had weapons of ‘mass
destruction. “Well, We have the
Kay report just coming out now
saying that they really haven’t
found anything much. And Bush
is asking for $600 million more
to keep looking.”

. , 0 Iraq was supporting the ter-
rorists who attacked us. “There’s
no evidence, of a link between al-
Qaida and the Iraqis, which even
Bush has now admitted.”

° A democratic Iraq would be
a stepping-stone to Middle East
peace. “This is a particularly weak
argument,” Simpson said. “VVhat
does a democratic Iraq, a Muslim 1
state, look like? VVhat gets to me
most of all is that the US. is now
ina colonial role: We chose the

do that.’ Ofcourse Germany's not

the coast. We put a few troops
in there and essentially pushed
the surrounding countries to take
charge of this problem; I don’t
obj ect to using our military forces
to put out ﬁres with the effect
ofmobilizing a region, but we
need to move quickly from that
and get regional and U.N. troops
to enforce the peace. We can’t
continue to be the policeman of
the world.”

3 . Make peace with the United
Nations. “The U.N. is there. If
it weren’t there someone would
have to invent it. In this age of
economic globalization — and
there’s not much point argu-
ing about whether that exists,
because it does: You see U.S.
Steel in Serbia, Alcoa in Ice-
land, a Ford Motor Co. factory
inChina—~oureconomydepcnds
on foreign trade and investment,”
Simpson said. bu’

“To get the U.N. involved, we
need to compromise, but that’s
not particularly extraordinary:
Bush’s father put togetheraviable
coalition of support for the Gulf
War, including radical Muslim
states like Syria.”

Similarly, the United States
should restore good relations
with traditional allies. “In Iraq
we acted pre-emptively and in
deﬁance of, or at least without
the sanction of, the international

community. We’ve also issued
non-competitive contracts
to Halliburton, Bechtel, _I.P.
Morgan for the rebuilding of
Iraq. Is it any wonder when we
ask Germany for help, and they
say, ‘Well, can we invest in Iraq

banks? Can we rebuild Iraq’s oil
industry?” Andwesay ‘N0 ..we-’ve

interested in helping.” .

The effect of this change,
Simpson said, would be to make
American actions more palatable
to other countries and lessen the
overall burden on the U.S. mili-
tary and economy.

“I think ‘these three things,
which could be done by this
administration, will get us back to
a sustainable U.S. foreign policy
that squares with our principles.
We need to behave like a democ-
racy, where we respect the rule of
law, instead of driving everything
with a heavy-handed military.
There’s no reason we should he

Art Deco

How itccime to be

"arbo, before she spoke.

lines shockingly raised

All are familiar images
spawned by the Art Deco move-
ment, which at its peak between
the two World Wars was the most
inﬂuential fashion and arts style in
the world —- and which continues

to inﬂuence fashion styles and ’

architecture today. _
At first Americans were
ambivalent about the move-
ment, belatedly joining Euro-
peans in the Art Deco craze of
the 1920s and ’30s — except in
Hollywood, where the movement
achieved early prominence, even-

" tually pulling av'erage Americans

along with it, according to Pitt
ﬁlm expert Lucy Fischer.
“VVhile a positive response
to Modernism was slow to take
hold in America,” Fischer said
in a Sept. 29 history of art and
architecture lecture, “ultimately,
the United States would become
a major proponent and4practitio-
_ner of the Art Deco aesthetic,”
including constructing such

landmark homages as Radio City

Music Hall and the Empire State

Building,

   

her seventh book, “Designing:

Women: Cinema, Art Deco and
the Female Form” (Columbia

University Press, 2003), Fischer, ‘

professor of ﬁlm studies and
English and director of Pitt’s
ﬁlm studies program, discussed
the ways in which ‘American
cinema of The Roaring ’20s and
The Dirty ’30s was beholden to
European inﬂuences. ,

In a c'hicken—or—egg paradox,
the dynamics of transnational
inﬂuence ﬂowed in both direc-

tions across the Atlantic, Fischer
maintained, particularly with
regard to Art Deco, a largely
European invention originally
dominated by French couture.
American cinema had enjoyed
international pre—eminence
from the beginning of the 20th
century, and bythe 192 0s and ’30s
Hollywood ﬁlms ﬂooded French

movie screens (in part because

' many French ﬁlm production

studios had been decimated by
bombings in World War I).

“But it is also true that French
design held tremendous sway
over the look of that hegemonic
American ﬁlm product,” Fischer
pointed out.

‘Known at its peak period as
Modernism orthe styleModerne,
the term Art Deco was coined
in the 1960s, derived from the
1925 Exposition Internationale
des_A_rts Decoratifs Industriels et
Modernes, held in Paris. ,

That exposition, in which
23 countries. participated, was
marked by the conspicuous
absence of the United States,
which had declined its invitation,
perhaps due to a lack of conﬁ-
dence in American design despite
a reputation for modernity and
progress, Fischer surmised.

While American connoisseurs

exposition was widely reviewed

thought it displayed bad. taste’

A or a symptom of Europe’s post-
World War I malaise not shared in

this country. “One group saw the

trend as anathema to America’s

sensibility and, therefore, called I

of the erotic, reﬂecting chang-
ing sexual morés in the 19205
and ’30s), the Art Deco period
not only influenced couture
and architecture, butgfurniture,
sculpture, jewelry and graphic
design as well.

And especially movies,
Fischer said. “It would not be
an overstatement to suggest
that, in the ’20s and ’30s, every
aspect of American ﬁlm form was

affected by the style Moderne,” .

she said, including set design and
decoration’ (which eventually
inﬂuenced home decor); cos-
tuming, especially of actresses;
the “carriage” and physiognomy
of actors through stage blocking
and posing; the graphics of movie

posters, and even the architecture i

of American movie theatres.
With 60 million-90 million
American moviegoers a week by
1930, “The ubiquity of the Art
Deco mode on movie screens of
the era helped to popularize con-
temporary design in America,”
Fischer said. In addition to the
broad international force of the

movement, there were a large '

number of European émigrés
working in Hollywood, who
brought a certain continental
sophistication that inﬂuenced

American culture, she said.

In MGM and Warner Bros.
melodramas of the 19205, when
the desires of a forward—think-
ing woman propelthe drama, the
scene is often set inza lavish Art
Deco home.

Greta Garbo’s 1929 silent
classic “The Kiss,” for example,

depicts a bored housewife who
takes a lover, which eventually
leads to her husband’s death and
her own trial for his homicide.
“The style Moderne signals
notionly female autonomy but
danger, clearly associated with
such‘ liberation,” Fischer said.
“The avant~garde environ-
ment in which she navigates [is
illustrated] both spatially and
morally.”

These melodramas, and

the RKO musicals of the era, _,
include “Deco touches,” such as

an insistent geometry, a subtle
use of indirect illumination, a
nod to exoticism and, ﬁnally, “the
sheer obsession with women r a
Deco hallmark inherited from Art
N ouveau,” Fischer said.

By 193 5, the inﬂuence ofArt
Deco became so prominent that
“America was beginning to chal-
lenge the pre—eminence of French
couture — and America’s deﬁance

Phtos: Museum of Modern An Film St///5 Archives

was tied to the cinema,” Fischer
said. “Hence a mere decade after
the Art Deco exposition of 1925
4 an event whose wares the
United States did not produce
and could only hope to imitate
— America’s artistic ‘anxiety of

inﬂuence’ had morphed into a

stylistic ‘delusion of grandeur.”’

Art Deco’s inﬂuence liveson,
if in diminished form, ‘Fischer
said. “Both the Great Depres-
sion and World War II obviously
created an atmosphere in which
questions of style and glamour
were somewhat de—emphasized
— in the ‘real’ world, at least, if
not always on‘screen,” she said.

Fads in furniture and clothing
‘emerge all the time, but thus far

have failed’to earn a tag compa-
rable to Art Deco.

“On some level, the Art Deco 9

style has never really retreated,
which is one sure signof its ‘clas-
sicism’ and vitality. For the past
decade or so, Art Deco has had
a strong inﬂuence on contempo-
rary design, as in large, curvilinear
furniture, in the revival of the
popularity of Fiestaware pottery
and in the architectural style of
such local shopping centers as
The Galleria in Mt. Lebanon.”

Pitt gets $18 million grant for biocontainment lab   

Pitt has won an $18 million
grant to create a Regional Bio—
containment Laboratory where
researchers will work on devel-
oping vaccines and treatments
for potential bioterror agents as
well as naturally occurring and
emerging infections.

The lab, scheduled for com-
pletion in summer 2005, will be
housedin the Biomedical Sci-
ence Tower 3, currently under
construction. ~ P

The National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
one of the National Institutes of
Health, awarded the grant. Pitt
will provide matching funds for
the biocontainment lab. .

The University plans to
develop a vaccine research
program focusing on naturally
occurring diseases like SARS,
West Nile virus, dengue, hem-
orrhagic viruses and encephalitis
viruses. In addition to infecting

people naturally, these diseases
have great potential to be “wea-
ponized,” researchers say.

“The construction of a
high-level biosafety facility will
contribute to the University of
Pittsburgh’s growing state—of-
the-art biodefense program by
creating a dedicated site where
this essential research can be
conducted safely,” said Arthur S.
Levine, Pitt senior vice chancel-
lor for the Health Sciences and
dean of the School of Medicine,
who is principle investigator on
the grant. _

In conjunction with Pitt’s
existingfederallyfunded research
programs on immunology and
infectious diseases, the biocon-
tainment lab “will enableus to
greatly accelerate the develop-
ment of vaccines, drugs and
diagnostics for viruses and other
infectious agents,” Levine said.

The new lab also will beneﬁt

from access to UPMC’s exten— .

sive network of urban and rural
hospitals, he said.

Tara O’Toole, chief executive
ofﬁcer of UPMC’s new Center
for Biosecurity, said: “We live in
an age when it is critical that we
use the nation’s extraordinary
scientiﬁc talent in the pursuit
of answers to the global security
threats posed by infectious dis—
eases. This new laboratory will
enable University of Pittsburgh
medical researchers to delve
further into possible treatments

and to develop vaccines. against V

diseases that might result from
bioterrorist attack or from natural
outbreaks.”

The National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases
offered funding for nine regional
biocontainment labs and two
national biocontainment labs
based on recommendations
from an expert panel that cited

l\Iew RFID tags
resolve privacy
problems

Radio frequency identiﬁca-
tion (RFID) tags, which are
expected to replace bar codes,
have been subject to scrutiny
by consumer privacy groups
who argue that products can be
tracked after theirpurchase.

Pitt electrical engineer

Marlin Mickle has a commer-
cially ready RFID tag — the
PENI Tag —— which can be
deactivated permanently, solv-
ing privacy problems for both
manufacturers and consumers.
“There would be a command

to kill the tags at the point of
sale,” said Mickie, a professor
in the Department of Electrical
Engineering. “It is the same prin-
ciple as a fuse in your electrical
system. Once a fuse ‘blows,’ it
must be replaced. In the PENI

, Tag, the fuse is an integral part

of the tag, and when it ‘blows,’
there is no way to reactivate it.
The tag can commit suicide on
command.” .
The PENI Tag (Product
EmittingNumberingIdentiﬁca-
tion Tag) works by converting an
incoming radio frequency signal
— picked up by an embedded
antenna — into direct current,
which powers the silicon tag and

transmits a signal back at a dif-
ferent frequency. Tags currently
being considered for commercial
use do not convert energy into
direct current, and none are as
small as Mickle’s 2.2 millimeter-
square silicon chip. The inter-
nal antenna, developed at Pitt,
recently was patented.

Other RFID tags being pre-

pared for commercial use can be
shut off by placing the products in
a kiosk, one at a time. The PENI
Tag, however, does not require
additional hardware because it

operates by a different mecha— ‘

nism than other tags, allowing
it to deactivate automatically.
If tags embedded in products
are not shut down, products
— including expensive items
— can continue to be tracked
by handheld “hacking” scanners
even after the product ‘leaves the
store.

“There are people who are

very concerned about privacy, and
those people should be accom-
modated and protected,” ‘said
Mickle. “That’s why Ithink the
ability to turnthese tags off is one
of the things that would satisfy
both the commercial manufac-
turer and the consumer.”
VVhe_n manufactured in large

 quantities, Mickle says, PENI

Tags should be cost-effective,
especially because inventory,
invoicing and checking out will

require less manpower. PENI

Tags ‘will cost substantially less

I than other RFID tags because

they require no assembly.

Pre-Incan

silver mining

revealed in

Bolivian Andes
Applying a technique never

before used in South America,

assistant professor of geology
MarkAbbott has found evidence

that a major pre—Incan _silver .

industry began in 11th century
Bolivia, 400 years earlier andon
a much larger scale than previ-
ously thought.

Geologists Abbott and co-
investigator Alexander. Wolfe
of the University of Alberta,
Canada, who study lake sedi-
ments, reported their ﬁndings
Sept. 26 in Science. ’

“Because the goal, of the
project was to study the paleo-
climate history of the area, the
mining history was not part of
the research design, ” said Abbott,
whose work was funded by the
National Science Foundation.
“Sometimes you get lucky and
ﬁnd the perfect site to investigate
more than one issue.”

Accordingto legend, the Inca
discovered silver at Cerro Rico de
Potosi, the largest silver deposit
in the Bolivian tin belt, in the
mid—I5th century. Fewknown
artifacts remain near Cerro Rico,

- because looting has been perva-

sive. It is believed that the silver
was recycled and transported

elsewhere in" -‘t'h‘e Ar'nerica’s‘ * tor”

exported by the Spanish.

Abbott and Wolfe analyzed
layers of sediment from Laguna
Lobato, a lake six kilometers
upslope and downwind from
Cerro Rico. They dated the
samples from ‘ the last 10,000
years based on radiocarbon and
lead-2 10, and analyzed the metal
content of the mud.

Higher than normal con-
centrations of metal in Bolivian
lake‘ sediments indicate smelt-
ing, which separates pure silver
from-ore at high temperatures
in a furnace. During smelting,
some metal was volatized, or
turned into aerosols, and carried
by wind into the lake bed, where

it settled to the bottom.

Abbott and Wolfe found that
concentrations of silver began to"
rise in l 100 C.E., coincidingwith
the late stages of the Tiwanaku

. civilization, prior to the rise of ,
_ the Incan ‘empire. Before 1000

C.E., the metal concentration
levels in the lake sediments of
Laguna Lobato were low and
stable, similar to levels found
in samples from 2000 B.C.E. to
600 C.E. A A .

‘ Known events, such as’ tin
mining at Cerra Rico during

,World War I, corresponded

with increased levels of tin in
sediment from that time.A peak
in silver after the Spanish arrived
in 1 5 42 further supports Abbott’s
research. A .

Until Abbott’s workin Bolivia,
using lake sediment composition
for archeologicalworkrarely had
been attempted, and had never

been applied in South America. V

In Europe, researchers have
attempted to look at levels of
lead in pre-Roman time, with
limited success. Accurate results

depend heavily on proximity to
the source, and the signal must
be very strong to show a differ-
ence.

“It was obvious to do,” Abbott
said, “but we didn’t think of it
until we were standing over it,
looking at the lake, andIwas kind
of surprised that it worked as well
as it did. It opens a door for new
research because now we can do
this in lakes close to ancient mine
sites, and there are a lot of these
in South America.”

Grant funds
nevv electron
microscope

The National Science
Foundation has awarded ~Pitt’s
Susan ‘Sesack a $2 56,000 grant
to acquire a biological electron
microscope with a digital pho-
tography system. Facultyin three
departments —— neuroscience,
biology and chemistry — will
use the equipment.

Sesack, an associate professor
in the neuroscience department,
said: “This grant came about

because of the large number of -

investigators conducting high-
impact, well-funded and well-
published research that addresses
biological issues.” .
Sesackwill use the microscope
to study brain structure, synaptic
connections and the locations of
proteins _important for neuro-
transmission. Sesack studies the
pathways of the neurotransmitter
dopamine, which is important for
emotion, movement and cogni-
tion. Her work has disputed and

organizational speciﬁcity.

“I am especially-pleased to
introduce digitalgmphotography
into our electron .microscopy
capabilities. We realized that

. this technology is" necessary to

keep up with the current speed of
research,” Sesack said. “Another
huge advantage to the technol-
ogy is the external display on a
screen separate from the viewer.
More than one person can see
at one time, so this will increase
the speed at which we can train
undergraduate, graduate and
postdoctoral students.”

microscope, a Phillips Mor-
gani 268, will be operational by
November. ’ ‘

“Because the caregiving expe-
rience in race and ethnic minority
families is particularly neglected
as a research focus in the ﬁeld,
there was a strong emphasis
placed on the inclusion of Afri-
can-American and Hispanic
caregivers,” said Schulz.

The results showed that
among all caregivers combined,
active treatments were superior
to control conditions, in which
participants didn’t receive treat-
ments, in reducing a caregiver’s
burden. Women and those
with less education reported a
signiﬁcantly lower burden with
active treatments than similar
individuals who did not receive
active treatments.

Caregivers in active interven-
tions who were Hispanic, those
who were non-spouses and
those who had less than high
school education reported lower
depression scores than those with
the same characteristics in the

A control group.

Interventions that empha-
sized active participation of the
caregiver in acquiring new skills
had the greatest impact in reduc-

, ing caregiver depression.

Among the active interven-
tions explored were ‘changing

I the nature of the speciﬁc stressors

and the caregivers’ assessments
of these stressors, as well as the
caregivers’ responses to the
stressors. ‘

Racial, A V’

socioeconomic 

disparities in
cardiovascular
risk studied
Cardiologists at the Univer-
sityofPittsburgh Medical Center
Cardiovascular Institute (CVI)
are trying to determine factors
that may explain established racial

, and socioeconomic disparities in

cardiovascular risk.
The study also will evaluate

the effectiveness of a commu-

nity-based intervention pro-
gram in the reduction of racial
and socioeconomic disparities
in cardiovascular risk among
intermediate- and high—risk
populations.

The four-year research study

is funded by a $4.3 million grant

from P ennsylvania’s Department
of Health as part of the state’s
share of the national tobacco
settlement. ‘

It is being conducted in con-
junction with the epidemiology
department at Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health (GSPH),
the Center for Minority Health
at GSPH, the Jewish Health-
care Foundation, the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, the Urban
League of Pittsburgh and the
Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center
(a collaboration of Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University).

“This research study will

, examine mechanisms for differ-

ences in the occurrence of heart
disease among various groups

of people based-on race, social

factors and neighborhoods,” said

‘ Steven Reis, associate professor

of medicine at Pitt’s School of
Medicine, director of clinical
research at the CVI and principal
investigator of the study.

“This study will also help
determine whether these racial,

social and geographic factors can
bereducedbyacommunity—based
program that uses counselors to
help people change their diet,
exercise habits and other behav-
iors such as cigarette smoking,”
he said. '

“Studies have shown that
disparities in cardiovascular risk
exist among minority and socio-
economically disadvantaged
populations in the region,” said
Daniel Edmundowicz, a Pitt
associate professor of medicine,
director of Preventive Cardiol-
ogy and the Comprehensive
Heart Center and a co-investi-
gator in the study.

“Our goal is to identify,
determine mechanisms for and
evaluate a multidisciplinary
community-based approach to
substantially reduce disparities
related to cardiovascular risk.”

Other Pitt/UPMC partici-
pants include Lewis Kuller, pro-
fessor of epidemiology, GSPH;

iGastric bypass.

resolves or
improves
diabetes in
most patients '

APitt medical school study of
obese people with type 2 diabe-
tes who underwent laparoscopic
gastric bypass surgery (LGBP)
found. .tha_.t. .83 percent ,of them
experienced a resolution of their
disease. Results were published in
the October issue of the journal
Annals of Surgery.

The study also found that
clinical resolution or improve-
ment in diabetes occurred in all
patients, but patients with the
shortest duration and mildest
form of type 2 diabetes had a
higher rate of resolution after
the surgery. During the study
there were no new occurrences
or recurrences of type ‘2 diabetes
in 3 10 patient years of follow-up.
Nearly one-third of patients per-
manently discontinued anti—dia-
betic medications after discharge

from the hospital — even before
significant weight loss could
occur.

According to Philip Schauer,
who is director of bariatric sur-
gery at Pitt, principal investigator
in the study and co-director of
the Minimally Invasive Surgery
Center at UPMC, the suidy sug-
gests that early surgical interven-
tion is warranted to increase the
likelihood of rendering these
patients euglycemic.

“Most patients in the study
with type 2 diabetes who under-
went bypass surgery achieved
excellent biochemical glycemic
control and were able to reap the
clinical beneﬁts of ‘withdrawing
frommost, ifnot all, anti-diabetes
medications, including insulin,”
Schauer said. “Younger diabetes
patients with less severe disease
stand to gain more from the
surgery.”

The study included 1,160
patients who underwent Roux-en
Y gastric bypass surgery. Of those
patients, 240 had impaired fasting
glucose and type 2 diabetes.-

“Prior to surgery, the disease
severity for these patients was
quite signiﬁcant overall,” said
Schauer, “with 65 percent of
them requiring oral agents and
27 percent of them requiring
insulin as well.”

Post surgery, patients had a
mean excess weight loss of 60
percent and a body mass index
of 34 after 20 months. Fasting
plasma glucose and glycoslated

hemoglobin concentrations
returned to normal levels I in
83 percent of patients, while
17 percent of patients markedly
improved. Following surgery,
80 percent ofpatients had a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in the use of
oral anti-diabetic agents and 79
percent had a reduction in their
use ofinsulin.

The LGBP procedure

involves constructing a small
stomach pouch of approximately
the size ofa plastic medicine cup
and bypassing a small segment
of intestines by constructing a
Y-shaped limb of small bowel.
Patients lose weight because
there is a decrease in caloric intake
resulting from the reduced reser-
voir capacity ofthe small stomach
pouch. . I

Administration nixes any new
faculty early retirement plan

CONTINUED FROM PAGE I

untarily relinquish their tenure
rights and retire between July
1998 and May 1999. In return,
they received payments equal to
1.5 times their annual contract
salaries, up to $125,000. More
than 40 percent of 381 eligible
faculty members signed up for
the plan.

At the time it was approved,
University ofﬁcials estimated that
the plan would save Pitt more
than $12 million (based on just
a 30 percent participation rate)
by encouraging retirements of

7 older, higher paid professors.

But Chancellor Mark A. Nor-
denberg also said that the main
reason the plan had been needed
in the ﬁrst place was to deal with
a backlog of-retirements resulting
from faculty expectations, dating
back to the early 1980s, that a new
early retirement plan was always
around the corner.

“This pattern created the

sense that, simply by delaying
their retirements, tenured fac-
ulty members would qualify for
payments in addition to their
normal retirement benefits,”
Nordenbergsaid in 1997. “VVhat
made sense in the 19805 is not a
strategy that will take us into the
next century. Our general retire-
ment plan is designed to provide

a secure and comfortable retire- '

ment for our faculty.”

Blair commented this week:
“Everybody understands that we
need some attrition in order to
bring new faculty members into
the University. But our current
faculty should make retirement
decisions based on their health,
their assessments of their TIAA-
CREF beneﬁts, family consid-
erations and so forth. People
should not hold out hope that
the University will be offering a
new early retirement plan.”

PEOPLE OF THE TIMES  

Joseph C. Maroon, vice
chair of UPMC’s Department
of Neurosurgery, will compete in
the Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon
Oct. 18 in Kona, Hawaii. This
140.6-mile world champion-
ship event consists of a 2.4—mile
ocean swim, a 112—mile bike race

' through Kona’s lava ﬁelds and a

26.2—mile run.

Maroon has participated in
numerous .
marathons
over the last
20 years and
more than
50 Olympic
d i s t a n c e
triathlon
events. This
event will -
mark his ﬁfth race of Ironman
distance — the most recent
being the European Ironman
Race in 2000, in which Maroon
finished in the top 10 in his age
category. He has competed in
previous Ironman competitions
in Hawaii, Canada, New Zealand
and Germany.

 

Maroon qualified for the
Hawaiian Ironman race by
completing the ,Muncie, Ind.,
Endurathon Half Ironman Race.
His ﬁnishing time of six hours
and ﬁve minutes designates him
as an All—American Triathlete
by the United States National
Triathlon Association, which
sanctions triathlon events in the
United States.

Maroon has served as the team
neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh
Steelers since 1981, and was a
consulting physician to the Pitt
Panthers from 1972 to 1983.

In addition to his athletic
endeavors, Maroon is a pro-
fessor of neurosurgery and a
Heindl Scholar in Neuroscience
at UPMC.

Maroon’s current research
and clinical activity concerns
treating diseases and injuries
to the brain and spine with an
emphasis on minimally invasive
treatment procedures. He is the
author of eight books.

With his colleagues, neuro-
psychologists Mark Lovell and

l\'IickeyCollins,hehasdeveloped
a neurocognitive testing method
to evaluate concussions in sports-
related injuries. The Immediate
Post—Concussion Assessment and
Cognitive Testing (ImPACT)
technique is the ﬁrst completely
automated system that allows
athletic trainers to determine
more accurately the severity of
a concussion and the safety of
a player’s return to play after
injury. This neurocognitive test
is now widely used throughout
the National Football League
(NFL), National Hockey League
(NHL), National Association of
Stock Car Auto Racing and hun-
dreds of colleges and high schools
across the country.

Lovell oversees the neuro-

OCTOBER 9, 2003

‘ Katz management science

program called best in nation

The discipline of manage-
ment science at Pitt’s Katz
Graduate School of Business
is the nation’s best in terms of
research productivity, accord-
ing to a new citation study by
Academic Assessment Services

(AAS), which released results of '

its study last week.

The same study also has
ranked five other disciplines
within Pitt’s Katz School as
being among the nation’s top 30
in research productivity:

— information systems, 7th;

— economics, 9th;

—— organizational behavior,
20th;

—accounting, 25th, and

— strategy, 29th.

I The rankings are the result of
an AAS study of nearly 1.5 mil-

- lion citations in selected busi-
ness disciplines to measure the

research productivity of the 4,918
full—time faculty members with
doctoral degrees in 51 business
schools. This research encom-

_ passed lifetime citation counts

for each faculty member.
The citation analysis AAS

» used counts the number of

times an article has been used
in later academic work by other
researchers. I
“Because it measures the
impact of work on the academic
community,” a Sept. 29 AAS,

_news release stated, “it is widely

regarded as a valid measure of

 

research productivity for schools,
departments and individual pro-
fessors.”

Full results of the study were
presented at the International
Business and Economic Research
Conference; the conference paper
can be seen on the AAS web site:
www.academicassessments.com.
