Dustin Lutomski has been
plagued with the same problem all
week.

When he called Student
Telephone Services _to set up his
voice mail account, the Pitt freshman
was greeted with an automated mes-
sage informing him that the
University’s voice mail service is
unavailable due to equipment mal-
functions. a '

“I’ve called every day to set it up,
and I get the same message. It’s kind
of annoying,” Lutomski said.

According to Jinx Walton, Pitt’s
director of Computing Services and
Systems Development, the problem

was first reported on Aug. 25. Walton
said that the University’s voice mail
service provider, Avaya
Communications, experienced prob-
lems with their databases that forced
the company to shut down the system
for emergency maintenance.

While the ‘malfunction affected
only a small number of student
accounts, the entire systemhad to be
suspended in order to make the nec-
essary repairs. A representative from
Avaya was unable to offer any infor-

mation about the cause of the prob-_

lems or a timetable forithe system’s
repair.

 MOSCOW —— After much pawing of

mayor has spoken: There will be no bull-
ﬁghting in Moscow.

excess of 150, said Louis Epstein, who

According to newly released 2000 cen-
sus information, there are now more than
51,000 Americans who are 100 or older,
among them about 1,400 so—called super-
centenarians who top 110.

bers are. probably inaccurate,’ mingling
human error with equally hrnnan wishful

they hold a kernel of truth: With each gener-

'ation of healthier and longer-lived

Americans, the romanticism of living to 100
is giving way to the reality of it.

NATO involvement could expand

SKOPJE, Macedonia —As foreign sol-
diers stream into this small nation for
NATO’s third Balkan mission in less than a
decade, rising resentment and violence are
fueling concerns that the operation’s limited
mandate could expand despite assrnances
from alliance oﬁicials that this deployment
will be different.

The 30-day mission is aimed primarily
at disarming ethnic Albanian rebels who vol-

untarily hand over their guns in exchange for '

anmesty. But there -are already ‘signs that
NATO involvement could deepen amid a
cease—ﬁre that is shaken almost daily by
bomb blasts’ and scattered gunﬁre.

On Tuesday, British N/3&0 soldiers led
a convoy of ethnic Macedonians back to the
rural village of Lesok, where villagers were
forced from their homes a month ago by the
guerrillas. As rebels watched from the hills
above, the soldiers escorted the villagers to a
service at ﬂre bomb-shattered local church.

Breaking the monotony with rhythm and rhyme
Pitt student Jason Flint, right, takes his turn in an improfnptu rap session in

the makeshift musical trio to turn down the volume, they were allowed to

students.“This is probably the best spot
right here in front of the [Union] ,” he said.
Stargate’s stand is one of the many
that gives away free gifts to students who
purchase its services. Burt Morris, a local
artist, designed the logo on the Stargate T-
shirts. 0
“The credit card companies have all
these goofy shirts and I thought that if we’re
going to have a shirt, it might as well be one
I would actually wear out,” Rosenson said.
James O’Shea, who sells subscrip-

‘ tions to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said

that one of his favorite parts of his job is the
students. '
“Not everyone’s bound by nine to

‘five, pay all the bills and stuff. You see

more freedom,” he said. He equated watch-
ing the students each day to “a really good
TV show.” -

Dan Fallon, who said he’s better

known as the Poster Dude, has nothing but A.
positive things to say about working at his

poster stand, something that he has been
doing for 15~years.

“It’s fun. That’s why I do it. The other
jobs I’ve had have not been so ﬁm. The ﬁrst
one being a lieutenant in Vietnam,” he said.

Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame. Even though
he admitted that he was dying for a cup of
coffee — he had driven from Cleveland
that moming to pick up an order that had
mistakenly been mailed there — his chee -
iness disguised his fatigue. ‘

When a student asked whether he car-
ried any Squirrel Nut Zipper posters, he
lamented that he had only canied their pro-
mos for a while, then continued in a con-
versation about the lead singer’s death.

Fallon explained that he was born and
raised in Pittsburgh, and that he enjoys
coming here both to sell posters and to visit
his ﬁiends and relatives. He, like all other
vendors, purchased a permit from Pitt to
sell his wares for the day. _.

Joe Cavalla, Pit1’s director of student
activities,‘ explained that he tries to sell per-
mits to vendors marketing things that stu-
dents will want to buy. Those selling ser-
vices, such as credit cards and cellular
phone contracts, must pay $100 per day,
while those selling goods pay $50 per day.
Vendors who don’t pay their fees or who
cause problems are denied permits. Cavalla
also said the ofﬁce will not grant permits to

vendors who sell obscene, pornographic or 1

discriminatory products.
“The things out there are pretty non-

controversial. The most radical thing we - 1

had was a tattoo company,” Cavalla said.‘

Fake IDs can  
accompany

IDs, page 1

Brian, and he’s never had a problem
with the ID. i P
“The worst thing that could hap-
pen is that they just take it,” he said.
Though various establishments
may choose to simply confiscate fake
IDs rather than report students to the
police, those who are caught face a
multitude of legal consequences.

’ In Pennsylvania, a person charged
with carrying false identification
faces a $300 fine for a first offense
and a $500 fine for second and subse-

quent offenses. In addition, a first— ‘

time offender also faces up to 90 days
in jail and a 90-day license suspen-

sion. For subsequent offenses, the

possible jail term increases to one
year and the license suspension to two
years.

- If a person under the age of 21 is
using the fake ID to purchase,‘possess
or transport alcohol, underage drink-
ing laws also apply. These laws can
invoke additional fines of $300 for a
first offense and $500 for a second
offense. License suspensions also
apply, lasting 90 days for a first
offense, one year for a second and
two years for all subsequent convic-
tions. '

The penalties for manufacturing
or selling false identification are even
more severe. The maker or distributor
of a fake ID faces a fine of $1,000 to
$5,000 and up to two years in jail.

If a Pitt student is caught by Pitt
police using a fake ID, then penalties
enforced by Pitt’s judicial board apply
as well as those invoked by state laws.

“It’s not a light matter,” said
Dennis Donham, director of the
University’s student judicial system.
“The student could get disciplinary
probation, for example.”

Donham said that the student
would also be referred to the Personal
Education Assistance Referral pro-
gram.

These PEAR classes serve as
required alcohol education for stu-

dents whose criminal offense is alco-

holic in nature.

Donham commented that only a
handful of students per year receive
judicial board sanctions for using fake
IDs to obtain alcohol. More common
are the students who are guilty of a
different type of false identification
offense: loaning their Pitt IDs to non-
students to gain admission to
University facilities.

Pitt works to restore voice mail

dents rests solely with Avaya, Walton
said there is little the University can
do to rectify the situation. But,

according to Walton, CSSD has ‘«

transferred all resident directors and
resident assistants to one of two cen-
tral voice mail servers to allow a
chain of communication for students
and parents in the event of an emer-
gency.

“We just wanted to make sure

- students had another form of con-

tact,” Walton said.
Some students are troubled by the

sudden shutdown of the server.
“It’s kind of a pain. My parents
are trying to call me, and I don’t want

them to think I’m never around,” said _

freshman Mike Maslanik.

But others seemed indifferent .

toward the problem.

“People get ahold of me if they
have to,” said freshman Erin Cogis.

According to Walton, it remains
unclear when the system repairs will
be complete, but CSSD remains
hopeful it will be by Friday.

“We’re_ doing everything we can
to keep the pressure on Avaya to fix it
as fast as they can,” she said.

Ice, ice baby  
Rink at PPG Place will liven Downtown

This holiday season, Pittsburghers
will have the opportunity to enjoy a
Rockefeller Center-like experience in
the heart of Downtown as PPG Place
will soon sport an ice rink.

Adding an ice rink is part of a larger
effort by Hillrnan Properties, Inc., to
liven up the area and make it a place
where people want to venture.

Finally, Pittsburghers are seeing a
good use of this public space, an area
that could attract people Downtown.
While it is a good beginning, Downtown
revitalization should not stop there.

On weekdays, Downtown is full of
people.‘ Market Square has become a
rocking place in more ways than one,
with both rocking chairs and concerts.

But on Sundays, Downtown is a

» completely different world. Practically

no one is there and many businesses are
closed. Downtown has many beautiful
plaza-like public spaces, but they are sel-
dom used.

Cities such as Philadelphia and
Chicago have vibrant downtowns.
Although Pittsburgh has several outlying
areas bustling with activity, such as the
Strip District and South Side, it needs a
centralized area where people could go
and know there is something to do.
Downtown is the perfect place for this,

and we have a few suggestions on how
to make it happen. . '

First, it would be ideal if there were
more — and cheaper — places to eat.
We’re not suggesting more fast-food
places, but more rnid-priced, sit-down
restaurants. Outdoor cafes would also be
a nice touch, especially in PPG Place
and along the rivers.

A movie theater could add to the
vibrancy of Downtown, as it would
attract people who would then discover
even more things to do there.

Venues for outdoor concerts and

other cultural events would also help.
While Downtown already has the
Cultural District, the entire area could be
utilized. «
And finally, the Downtown area
could make better use of the three rivers.
Philadelphia and San Antonio have
turned formerly rundown riverfronts into
vibrant venues for leisure and entertain-
ment. .

Pittsburgh has the same potential.
The_city has already made great strides
on the North Shore and at Station
Square, but it needs to ﬁll the gap in the
Golden Triangle. Some call Pittsburgh
the River City. Perhaps the city will
ﬁnally turn the rivers into an asset for
civic enjoyment.

Why hot Red Cloud?

Dollar coin should show Lakota chief 8

While working at Kiva Han one day
this summer, a customer handed me the new
dollar coin to pay for his coffee. This coin,
the latest attempt to introduce a metallic
form of the basic unit of our currency, fea-
tures the Shoshone Indian Sacajawea, who
helped guide Meriwether Lewis and
VV1lliamClarktothePaciﬁcOceaninthe
early l9tl1 century. '

Although other customers used dollar
coins in the past, I never both-
ered to ponder them before this
occasion. But this was a slow
day.

The customer and I both’
commented on how nice it was
to see a Native American — and
a Native American woman at
that — on a coin.

But the more I thought
about it, the more I began to
feel uncomfortable with the

    

David McKenzie-
Perspectives Editor

So, because she was essential to an
expedition whose long-term, ultimate conse-
quences would lead to the destruction of her
people, she gets her head on a coin.

What a lovely message to send to those
around the world who use the American dol-
lar as their prefened cunency.

. In his book “Custer Died for Your
Sins,” the radical Lakota (the preferred term
for “Sioux”) historian Vine Deloria Jr.

explains that the Native
Americans about whom we
learn in school are the ones
who cooperated with white set-
tlement. He further argues that
those who rebelled against
white expansion across the
' continent are regularly ignored
or demonized
Their peoples are routine-
ly depicted as part of the
inevitable genocide "of our con- ‘

idea of this ‘particular Native
American woman being featured on the
coin. .

It’s almost as if the Treasury
Department picked her as a way to make
American currency a bit more politically
correct, to placate those who (rightfully)
complain that only rich white men are
depicted on the ‘coins. .

The only response to this criticism the
Treasury Department oifcrs in a press
release armouncing the coin is that Robert

Rubin, then thesecretary of the treasury,

chose “Sacajawea, the Native American-

woman whose presence was essential to the
success of the Lewis and Clark expedition.”
It oﬁers no other explanation of why she, in
particular, received the distinction of being

’ tinent’s original inhabitants in
the name of progress.  '

Itappears thatthe same thingthathap-'
pens with who we teach our kids about is
happening with whom we put on ‘our
coinage. Only “friendly” Native Americans
need apply.

Nonetheless, the Treasury Department
wants to appear politically correct by placing
Sacajawea’s likeness on a coin. Perhaps
Disney even thought the same when it made
a ﬁlm about Pocahantas.

But by choosing Sacajawea, the »

Treasury Department only further exacer-
bates the problems Deloria 

Some would argue that we do not want '

to incite a spirit of nonconformity and that

Red Cloud’s face should grace

placing a more rebellious Native American on coins would
do just that. But didn’t George Washington (on the $1 bill),
Thomas Jefferson (on the $2 bill), Alexander Hamilton (on
the $10 bill) and Benjamin Franklin (on the $100 bill) rebel
against being Sllbiugated‘?

Four of the seven major paper bills in circulation today

celebrate those who rebelled against subjugation, albeit

white men who rebelled successfully.

Since we seem to like rebellious ﬁgures on our curren-
cy, I have some suggestions of oﬂrer Native Americans who
could replace Sacajawea on the dollar coins.

- Chief John Ross. In 1838, the federal government
removed the Cherokee Nation from its territory in present-
day Georgia Ross, through peaceful means, attempted to
ﬁght the government for years, citing the fact that his tribe
hadbeenguaranteeditslandsinprevioustreaties andhad
adopted a republican system of government. The state of
Georgia did not care; it wanted the land , ‘

Even the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the tribe. In its
1830 ruling in Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia, the court ruled
that the government did not have the right to remove the
Cherokees.

But President Andrew Jackson (on the $20 bill) said that
he would not enforce the Court’s decision, and didn’t Ross
and the Cherokees were illegally forced ﬁorn Georgia to
Oklahoma On the ‘Trail of Tears,” a great number of them
died

Perhaps Ross should not be ' on the dollar coin, but
instead should replace Jackson on the $20 bill. After all, Ross
fought for the ﬁeedorn of his people (and not even violenﬂy,
unlike others on our currency) and respected the rule of law.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

 

Junior Carrie Norris set a school record last season with 80 assists in a game

against 20th-ranked Notre Dame.

COURTESY OF PITT ATHLETICS

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer I

In the Big East preseason rank-
ings, the Pitt women’s volleyball
team is ranked second behind defend-
ing conference champion Notre
Dame.

It’s Pitt’s highest ranking in quite
a long time, but it comes with good
reason.

Last year’s team compiled a 22-
10 record overall and 8-4 in the Big
East, which was a considerable
improvement from the Panther teams
of recent years.

Still, second-year head coach
Chris Beerman realizes there are
some questions to be answered about
this year’s team.

One of the greatest problems will
be how the team will adjust to losing
a lot of seniors, including big-time
players Stacy Renick, Jennifer
Nickels and Marcia Thiesen.

“I was just surprised we were
ranked that high in the preseason
since we basically have eight players
who have never played Division I ball
before,” Beerman said. “But it just
shows a lot of respect.”

Beerman expects a couple of sea-
soned veterans to step up into the
graduates’ shoes.

“Carrie Norris, our setter, has to
be the leader of our team,” Beerman
said of the junior who was named to

Volleyball team on the rise

the American Volleyball Coaches
Association All-Northeast Region
Team last year.

Norris set a new school record
last season with 80 assists in a game
against 20th-ranked Notre Dame. The
previous record had been 76,
achieved by players in 1991 and
1993.

Beerman is also counting on
senior middle hitter Heather Haff for
leadership.

“I expect those two to be the peo-
ple that are leading us,” Beerman
said.

One player almost guaranteed to
have a lot of kills this year is sopho-
more Wendy Hatlestad, who burst
onto the Big East scene last year and

-..was named to the conference All-

Rookie team at year’s end.

Hatlestad left such a good impres-
sion, she was invited to practice with
the volleyball national team over the
summer.

“Wendy had a great summer,”
Beerman said. “She had some intema-
tional experience, wore the ‘USA’
across her chest and even got to play
in the Dominican Republic. I expect
her to have a great season.”

As for the freshmen, Beerman
said they’re adjusting well, but
they’re also a work in progress.

“It’s a lot different from high

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

The football season may not officially
start until Saturday, but the festivities have
already begun.

They will continue tomorrow‘ when the
Alumni Association hosts a pep rally down-
town in Market Square from 5:30 to 8:30
p.m.

During the event -there will be appear-
ances by Pitt’s marching band, Pitt’s cheer-
leaders and dance team, the Pitt Panther and
head coach Walt Harris. Pitt fans will also be
entertained by live music from The House of
Soul.

There will be all kinds of discounted

- For at least the next 20 years, Pitt’s

home will be Heinz Field, and Saturday’s
contest against East Tennessee State will
mark the first official game at the new stadi-
um. Pitt will have plenty of exciting events
and attractions planned for the 65,000-seat
facility throughout the season, and many
pregame features are planned for Saturday.

The game ball will be delivered by the
Special Tactics and Rescue Specialist
Parachute Team, along with the world’s
largest American ﬂag, in an A-10 ﬂyover by
the U.S.Air Force. The flag, which will

Jkz/mk0’s bark may be worse than his bite

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

In the course of Pitt football, players come and go,
some leaving big marks, some only leaving with mem-
ories to tell their grandkids. But one thing has remained
a constant for the team throughout the past ﬁve seasons:
the attitude of assistant head coach Bob Junko.

At football practice every day, Junko gets his point
across to his players with a voice that can probably be
heard. all the way to New York City. Hearing how
hoarse he is at the end of the day is an indication of how
hard he works. ,

His job is not easy, because not only is Junko the
assistant to Walt Harri s, but he also coaches the defen-
sive tackles and is the father of punter and wide receiv-
er Jay Junko.

Junko began his coaching career 33 years ago at the
University of Tulsa and since then has been all over the
country. He worked at Pitt from 1982 to 1985 as the
defensive coordinator. In l997,Harris offered Junko a
job as the defensive tackles coach.

“[I came to Pitt because of] the people at the
University, starting with the athletic director, the presi-
dent and coach Harris,” Junko said. “I think sometimes
you have to be at the right place at the right time, with
the right people, and I think I’m very fortunate to be
back here at the University with those people.”

Last year Junko became Pitt’s assistant head coach.
As Harris’ backup, Junko deals with some of the other
coaches’ problems so Harris can focus on the‘ games. As
a veteran coach, Junko has the knowledge necessary to
relay information to other coaches on what they should

COURTESY OF PITT ATHLETICS

Assistant head coach Bob Junkois known for his
loud style of praise and reprimand.

be trying to achieve. '

Junko has had a deﬁnite impact on the program,
and last year coached tackles Mike White and Joe
Conlin to career seasons. Since coming to Pitt, Junko
has coached Demond Gibson and Frank Moore, two

A11-‘Big East performers. But when asked who were the
toughest players he had coached, J unko had a few more
names to add to the list. ‘

“Troy Benson, Chris Doleman and Bill Maas were
tough people because. they took no prisoners,” Junko
said. “There were a few better football players, but they
were tough people.” ,

But Junko is known best on Pitt’s football team for
his coaching style. Whether a player makes anexcep‘—
tional or poor play, Junko is likely to be in the player’s
face making his thoughts known. People can often tell
where the defensive tackles are on the practice ﬁeld
because Junko can be heard from end zone to end zone.

“There is only one way to coach defense, and that’s
to be enthusiastic and demanding,” Junko said. “That’s
what you have to be and you can’t be a nicey-nice guy.
I enjoy being on the footballﬁeld, so that [yelling] is

just a part of it. It’s just the way I am. You coach the

way you are.” I
But while Junko shows his enthusiasm on the ﬁeld,

it’s hard at times to determine if he is reprimanding an .

player or praising a good play. .

“Most of the time it’s a positive statement,” Junko
said. “If I feel they need to get a kick in the pants, then
it will be negative. But it’s never personal.”

Junko’s players appreciate his enthusiasm on the

ﬁeld, and the yelling is just a part of practice that play- -

ers get used to after a while.

“[Coach Junko] keeps me on my toes,” said senior
defensive tackle Bryan Knight. “He pushes you to
make sure you are all right. He understands from a

school and club games, and I think the
intensity surprises them,” Beerman
said. “They’re Very tough-minded,
and they fit right in to what we’re try-
ing to do. Two of them are going to
see time in special situations this
weekend already.”

This weekend is the Las Cruces
Hilton Classic in Las Cruces, N.M.
Beerman thinks the tournament will
be more of a feeling—out time for the
team than anything else.

“We’re going to find out who our

players are going to be, what our best
lineup is and really just test the new
people,” Beerman said.
Beerman will get some added help
with his young team from assistant
coaches Jason Tanaka and Salima
Davidson. _

Davidson is a newcomerto‘ the
staff this year that Beerman believes
comes with some excellent creden-
tials.

“She was a Big Ten Player of the

Year, a three-time All-American, and ‘
, played on the national team for five

years,’.’ Beerman said of Davidson.
_“Her personality has brought a lot to
the team, too. She’s very outgoing
and very confident. She was a great
hire for us.”

It’s also going to be the first taste
the team gets of the new rally-scoring
format that’s being introduced in col-
lege volleyball this year.

Beerman said that it changes the
game completely.

The sideout version of scoring,
"where only the team that was serving
the ball could score, has‘ been
replaced with rally scoring in which
every play counts.

“Every time the ball hits .the ﬂoor,

it’s a point for either side,” Beerman.

said. “It’s going to require you to
make less mistakes, since every time
you make a mistake, it’s a point for
the other team. You’re going to have
to get off to a good start, because big
leads are goingto be very hard to
come back from.” “It ’ s
going to add a lot of excitement for
the fans,” Beerman said. “The
women’s game has gotten so big,
strong and athletic that you were real-
ly being stuck at scores for a long
time.” _

Beerman recalled a game against
N otre Dame last year where the teams

were stuck at a 6-6_tie for 20 minutes.

The new scoring system should
help eliminate scoring droughts like
that.

“There’s going to be a score every,
_ play, and I think fans are going to

appreciate that,” Beerman said.

. player’s standpoint onlhow to play the

game.” 1 _

Junko has learned many little tech-
niques and bits of information through-
out his career. Junko coaches the way he
wants his players to play on game day: to

‘ the best of their abilities.

“They [the players] reﬂect you, so
when they are out there, they are reﬂect-
ing me,” Junko said. “It’s just like when
you are a parent and your child reﬂects

__ .. you.”

Junko’s three sons Jeff, Mike and
Jay are also an important part of his life.

Jay is the backup punter and wide
receiver at Pitt, and Junko considers it
heaven on earth to be able to coach for
his son’s team.

“It’s very enjoyable,” Junko said. “I
never have a day off during a college
football season, so I could never come
watch him play at another school. It is a
very positive thing for myself.”

Most positive things come for Junko
when he sees his players doing well on
the ﬁeld. Be sure to watch the sidelines
on game day because Junko will be
there, throwing down his cap and yelling
words of encouragement to his players
on the ﬁeld.

Panthers to move into state—of-the-art Heinz Field

Festivities, page 9

to Panther football,” athletic direc-
tor Steve Pederson said during a
press conference earlier this sum-
mer. “But we want to make Sept. 1
a day that no one will want to
miss.” Pitt’s marching band will
also play a prominent role in the
festivities, including a postgame
performance with Taylor.

“_This will be the beginning of
not only another great football sea-
son, but also the opening of a fabu-
lous new era in Panther football,”
Pederson said. “We are excited

about opening that era in style.”

The evening will conclude with
a fireworks display on the river-
front.

Many old traditions will remain
as game-day fixtures, such as the
Panther Prowl and FanFest. The
players will arrive at each game two

hours early and fans can still line -

the path to greet.the team.

As soon as the prowl concludes,
the band will play its traditional
concert and then march from PNC
Park down Bill Mazeroski Way to
the stadium. .

The FanFest will be held at the

UPMC Sports Works at Carnegie
Science Center, where admission. is
free with a ticket for that day’s
game. Pitt will host six football
games at Heinz Field this year and
many more events are planned for
future games. -

0 Pitt Stadium was a. fixture at
the University for a long time, but

the stadium became dated and I

Pederson orchestrated the move to
Heinz Field.

The new stadium is state-of—the—
art and a simple look at some statis-
tics comparing the two stadiums

can be quite staggering.

The new stadium has a heated
grass surface that won’t freeze.
Also, the grass is rooted several feet
into the ground and it has been
planted, so even if it rains the field

' will not get muddy. Saturday will

mark the first time since 1969 that
the Panthers will play on a natural
turf. -I

The new stadium’s fan features
include more than‘40O television
monitors, two video walls, 32 con-
cession areas, club seating and 122
luxury boxes.

Pitt Stadium had no television
sets or video walls, only 10 conces-
sion stands and no club seating or
luxury boxes. The new stadium will
also have nine retail stores and 50

publicbathrooms, compared to no_

retail stores and 20 bathrooms in
Pitt Stadium.

The fans are also much closer to ,

the field at Heinz Field. It is only
60 feet from the sideline to the first
row, while there was‘10l feet of
distance in Pitt Stadium.

Finally, the scoreboard video
‘display size is 48 feet by 27 feet
and can expand to 96 feet by 27feet
-while Pitt Stadium’s video score-
board was only 20 feet by 22 feet.‘
