UNIVERSITY TIMES 1

To the editor:

Positive change is in the air,
despite these darkly uncertain
times. The University Times
reported two recent actions on
the part of the University of Pitts-
burgh that should make us feel
proud. The ﬁrst came in Decem-
ber 2 002 when Pitt announced its
new Center on Race and Social
Problems for research on race and
its effects in daily life. The second
action involved Pitt’s decision to
ﬁle an amicus curiae brief joining
dozens" of other institutions of
higher learning in siding with
the University of Michigan on
its afﬁrmative action court case.

The University Times (Feb.
20, 2003) also reported Temple
University’s decision to offer
access to same-sex domestic
partner beneﬁts for its employ-
ees. Though Temple’s same-sex
beneﬁts package remains less
than ideal, it nonetheless bodes
well for more equitable coverage
in the future. Such good news
at Temple did little more than
elicit a lamentable statement
from the powers that be here,
however. Robert Hill, Pitt vice
chancellor for Public Affairs,
stooped to a new low by blam-
ing Pitt’s continuing denial of
same-sex beneﬁts on those who
are discriminated against under
current University practice.
Those faculty and staff who
have brought suit against Pitt
are responsible, he suggested, for
tying the University’s hands when
it comes to doing the right thing.

Instead of,b,1aII1.f!.!.}g th9.,.,vicﬁt9;,.,._

should now look to ways in which
we, too, can join other forward-

‘ looking entrepreneurs, schools

and institutions throughout the
state who recognize that discrimi-
nation is bad for education and
bad for business.

Fearing for our appropriation
standing, University administra-
tors have insisted all along that
the political climate in Pennsyl-
vania was unfavorable to taking
the moral high ground on this
question. It is now clear, in the
words of Tom _Hickey, spokes-
man for Gov. Ed Rendell, that
the new state administration
has inaugurated a new era. The
governor, Hickey reported to
the University Times (Feb. 20,
2003), is “certainly supportive of

Temple’s action.” The ball is now - -

in the Pitt administrations court

2 and nowhere else. It is time for

Pitt to do the right thing and cease

legal action by instating beneﬁts
for same-sex domestic partners.
As a leading university we should
have the courage and integrity to
build on the positive steps we have
taken recently. Now is the time

' Robert Hill, vice chancellor; Public

Affairs, reponds:

In expressing her strongly held

belief}, Proﬁ’ssorMcCloskejyadvances '

an argument that is ﬂawed in at least
two fundamental respects.

The ﬁrst is her unwillingness,

to acknowledge that the existence
of litigation changes the context ﬁrr

‘deliberation, discussion and deci-

sion—making. It is absolutely clear;
however, that the action taken
by Temple University would not
resolve‘ the claims that have been
so aggressively asserted against this
University. In fact, the University
Times has quoted one of the claim-



072£’ 1.5’/If Zl7Zﬂ£Z'€Plﬂ”ZEﬂJ'720t0 
same-sex beneﬁts at all.’ ” .
The second is her suggestion. tha

the election of a new governor has
eliminated the budgetary risks that
have beena concern of Pittand other
state-ﬁmded institutions. However,
those_ concerns always have been
focused principally on the legislators,
not on the governor: Even fbr those
who do not closely follow the states
budget-building process, events of
‘recent weeks serve as a reminder
of the legislature’s important and
somewhat independent role.

At the urging of the members of

committee that ProfessorMcCloskey
represents, a broadly representative
committee was empaneled to study
Pitt’s situation and to make recom-

Pitt wants to build 5    

dorms near The Pete

itt hopes to build ﬁve
undergraduate’ resi-
dence halls on the upper

campus east of the Petersen
Events Center, bringing the
Pittsburgh campus’s capacity to
about 7,000 beds.

. Bob Reppe, City Planning
department official, said Pitt
has applied for a conditional use
permit, which is required for
construction of residence halls or

fraternities under the city’s 1998 ..

institutional zoning codes.

( “At the‘ same time, under
zoning regulations that went
into effect in" 1999, Pitt also

must seek approval for its insti- '

tutional Master Facilities Plan,”
Reppe said. That plan includes
expansion of the lower campus’s
Clapp-Langley-Crawford halls
complex between Fifth Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard, as well
as identifying potential future
construction sites.

According to a preliminary
proposal sent to the planning
commission, the ﬁve dorms will
be between three and nine stories
high, providing a totalof about

r 1,000 beds, Reppe said. The proj— .

ect calls for opening at least some
of the dorms by fall 2004.

Pitt Vice Chancellor for
Public Affairs Robert Hillsaid
the goal of the housing project
was to make it possible to offer

undergraduates on—campus,

ﬁrst—class campus housing to stu-
dents who want it from freshman

year through graduation,” Hill
said. The University would like
to have 400-450 beds available by

2 the fall of 2004, he said.

“We do not have cost esti-

mates yet,” Hill said, “but the '
University resources used [to .

construct the dormitories] will
be made up from rental receipts
from those students who even-
tually live in the buildings. We
will not be using tax levy funds
or tuition funding.”

Both the conditional-use

dorm proposal. and the revised

'master plan must secure city

planning and Pittsburgh City
Council approval, Reppe said.

. Pitt’s projects are on the agenda

for the planning commission’s
next public meeting, March 2 5 .
According to Eli Shorak, asso-
ciate vice chancellor for business,
Pitt will - present design and con-
struction plans forthe new dorms,
to be located on and near Univer-

sity Drive, at that_meeting.

Reppe said, “The commission
will hear Pitt’s proposal, and likely
will vote on it at its next scheduled
meeting (April 8). If it’s approved,

it goes to City Council, but it’s not -

on council’s agenda yet. Pitt has

1984, Penny combined the talents
of a poet, dramatist, teacher and
social activist. *

Colleagues described Penny
as profoundly committed to his
African rootsand a person who
inspired others in the classroom,
in workshops and in the street.

“He was deeply African, with
African values and paradigms,
which guided his poetry, drama
and teaching,” said Africana stud-
ies department chair.-Joseph K.-
Adjaye. “His teaching and phi-
losophyheld thatAfricana studies
is a distinct discipline with its own

‘ methodology and pedagogy. He

was committed to the idea that
knowledge in the classroom has
little meaningwithoutits enhanc-
ing of black life. His tragic passing
is a big loss to the department,
the University and the black
community.” '

Dennis Brutus, emeritus pro-
fessor of Africana studies, said,
“As a teacher, Rob was a person
who inspired his students. He was
always encouraging and helpful.
As a poet myself, I can say he also
was a ﬁne poet, in the black poetic
tradition, who inspired others
to write, especially through the
Kuntu Writers Workshop. And
he was a man who was an inspi-
ration to young people in terms
of his activism and community
activities. [His death] is a great
loss to the community.”

Penny was a proliﬁc writer
whose works. included more
than 300 poems and 30 plays.
His plays were produced in New

York, Chicago, Tucson and other
national venues, as well as‘locally
by Kuntu Repertory Theatre,
which was founded in 1974 by
Vemell A. Lillie, associate profes-
sor of Africana studies. ‘
His works explore the African
American cultural experience,
especially in working—class Pitts-
burgh, where his plays invariably
were set. ' H
Born in Opelika, Ala., Penny
was raised from a young age in
Pittsburgh’s Hill District. A self-
styled Afrocentric artist, Penny
was mostly self-taught. He was
heavily influenced by famed

' playwright and American. social

critic Amiri Baraka, whose work

Jack Daniel, vice provost for
Academic Affairs and dean of stu-
dents, said Penny was in the ﬁrst
cohort of faculty Daniel hired in
1969 when he was chair. of the
then-D epartment of Black Stud-
ies. “In terms of his professional-
ism, he was as close as someone

can get to being an unrecognized -

members worked on campus
and two worked Downtown at a
CGS satellite site, according to
Robert Hill, vice chancellor for
Public Affairs.

In addition, three vacant CGS V _

staff positions will not be ﬁlled.
All 11 eliminated positions were
full time, Hill said.

CGS now employs 38 full-
time staff members. '

Asked whether this month’s
CGS move was budget-related,
Hill said, “Everything’s budget-
related. But the driving force of
this decision was to re-position
the College of General Studies
to better service the students and
employers of our region, where

Ofﬁcers (NACUBO).

NACUBO found that, for
the second consecutive year, the
average college and university
endowment lost value during
the ﬁscal year 2001-02 amid
investment market declines and
a poor economy. V

Among 556 surveyed insti-
tutions with a ﬁscal year ending
on June 30, 2002, the average
endowment fell in value by 6
percent. Among public univer-
sities only, the decline was 6.4
percent. .

Pitt’s endowment gained in
value by 4.6 percent during FY
2001-02, but that’s because the

’University’s investment losses

were exceeded by transfers of
gifts_ and quasi-endowment funds
into the endowment, according
to Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Budget and
Controller.

(NACUBO’s annual survey
measures an endowment’s change
in market value during a ﬁscal
year. Such factors as growth from
gifts, reductions due to expendi-
tures and withdrawals — not only
investment returns —— determine
an endowment’s end-of-the—year
market value.)

 

Work were asked to leave the
University or take lower paying
jobs in the school as the result of

budget cuts, a school ofﬁcial said i

at the time. ‘ V

Given the strains on Pitt’s
budget, could other staff face
layoffs? Hill said, .“We had a

few [positions eliminated], in

the single digits, in the course
of the last year. I do not expect
there to be any more staff posi-
tion elirninations this ﬁscal year,
or, at most, a handful.”

Staff Association Council

(SAC) ofﬁcers declined com-

ment on the CGS action.
SAC has closed its last two

full—membership meetings (Feb.
12 and March 12) to everyone
except members and guests.
Rich Colwell, SAC vice presi-
dent for steering, told the Uni-
versity Times that SAC ofﬁcers
and members “are not at liberty
to respond to the questions that
are speciﬁc to [the March 12]
agenda,” because the group
agreed to keep the meeting’s
discussion conﬁdential.

Colwell acknowledged that

Frisch, who usually attends
SAC meetings, was a guest at
the March 12 closed meeting.

Two SAC members who
attended the March 12 meeting
told the University Times that
staff layoffs were discussed. The
two members declined to give
details.

The CGS dean’s office
referred inquiries to Public
Affairs’ Hill. ‘

he Bradford campus has
- eliminated seven full-

time and three part—time

"staff and faculty positions.

‘ The move came in response to
a 4 percent ($470,000) reduction
in Bradford’s operating budget,
according to Williams A. Shields,
Bradford campus interim presi-
dent. “These reductions are part
of a University-wideresponse to
reduced appropriations from the
Commonwealth,” Shields said.’
Since» $8 million of Pitt-
Bradford’s $12 million operating
budget is earmarked for faculty
and staff salaries and beneﬁts,
campus ofﬁcials were forced to

make reductions in these areas, ’

he said.

“This was very difﬁcult for us
to do,” Shields said. “We didn’t
want to see anyone lose his or her
job, but unfortunatelyit was nec-

essary in the current economic

climate that has affected so many

in every area of the economy,

including higher education.” ‘
‘Shields said the latest budget

reductions included staff and fac-
already eliminated one-time costs
1 to meet part of the budget cut

imposed this ﬁscal year.

“We’ve attempted to make
the personnel cuts fairly, cor-
rectly and humanely,” Shields.
said. “By fairly, we have decided
the cuts should be made in both
staff and facultyareas. By cor-
rectly, we are doing this accord-
ing to established University

Larger endowments per-
formed better than smaller ones
during FY 2001-02, NACUBO
found. Endowments exceed-
ing $1 billion, including Pitt’s,
showed an average loss of 3.8
percent compared with losses of
6.6 percent for endowments of
less than $25 million.

The primary reason that
“bigger is better” among endow-
ments is that larger holdings tend

to be more diversiﬁed, according _

to NACUBO-

“During the 19903, college
and university endowments
experienced increased return
rates and reduced investment
volatility through excellent
asset diversiﬁcation and a soar-

ing economy,” said NACUBO V
president James E. ’Morley Jr. '

“The asset allocations that served
endowments well in the recent
past allow endowments to achieve
continued investment returns
above market norms.”

To further diversify Pitt’s
endowment portfolio and as a
hedge againstinﬂation, the Board
of Trustees’ investment commit-
tee voted this month to increase

humanely, we will do everything
we can to support those people
whose jobs have been affected,
including following up with ref-
erences and helping them ﬁnd
other positions.”

' Some of the affected posi-
tions were eliminated through
attrition, Shields pointed out.

10 faculty,

He wouldn’t say how many of

the positions were faculty and

how many were staff.

According to a_ fact sheet
posted on the Pitt—Bradford
web site prior to the announced
position eliminations, UPB has
a total of 245 employees: 75
full-time faculty; 42 part-time
faculty; 110 full-time staff, and
18 part—time staff.

Cuts also were made in non-
personnel areas, including a 1
percent reduction in non-salary
budgets. H

. Shields said the cuts will help
to control tuition and protect the
integrity of Bradford’s academic
programs.

“We understand how much
tuition affects students, prospec-
tive students and their families,
and it’s our responsibility to
maintain the quality of our aca-
demic programs and to operate
as efﬁciently as possible in an
effort to keep those tuition rates
as affordable as possible.”

Shields said the cuts will

staff obs

not affect current construction
projects, which are supported
by central University appropri-
ations, commonwealth funding
and private donors. . .
KimberlyMurphey, president
of the Bradford StaffAssociation,
an elected group representing
campus staff, said that Shields
spoke to the campus community
,March 1 l, reiterating his reasons
for the position eliminations
and other budget—tightening
measures. _
“He was very forthcoming
with all of us, which we greatly
appreciate,” she said. She said
the Staff Association has taken
the position thatthe layoffs
were necessary and that staff
should work to keep up campus
spirits. “At our last meeting, I
addressed [the layoffs] myself,”
Murphey said this week. ‘‘I said

we needed to continue to do >

everything we could as staff to

Pitt endowment manag-

The change comes at the

such as U.S. Treasury bonds.
The newplan is to keep 15

down from the previous target
of 20 percent. ‘

“The reason for making this
change,” said Pitt Vice Chan-

But the system is academically

agreed members of a University

Therefore, the review com-
mittee concluded, Pitt business

no longer be required to have

should be permitted to maintain
alternatives to PBCS (subject

denberg — who is a Council
member, and helped to draft the
original 1992 ‘document spelling
out the University Planning and
Budgeting System — voted for
the changes and made it clear
he would approve putting them
into effect. ,

The planning and budgeting

system has served Pitt well, he

said at Senate Council last week.
The original system document
wasn’t perfect “but it was a good
document, and it will be made
even better by these changes,”

the chancellor said.
Amendments range from
minor editorial points (such as
updating some administrators’
job titles) to changes aimed at
bringing the document into
closer alignment with actual
processes and making the system
more ﬂexible and efﬁcient.

“For example,” the review—

committee stated, “the require-
ment that the chancellor make
all planning information and
guidelines available to all mem-
bers of the University community
is cumbersome compared to the
requirement a few lines later that
unit heads make suchinformation
available to the faculty, staff and
students in their units. It also
seems unrealistic to’ require
every unit’s planners to discuss
and coordinate their plans with
other-units,” as the original docu-
ment required.

Under another amendment,
unit requests for budget aug-
mentations no longer must be
reported to the -provost-chaired
University Planning and Budget-
ing Committee (UPBC), which
functions as the chancellor’s
PBC.

' Also, the UPBC will no longer
be expected to prioritize detailed
plans and budgets for schools,
campuses and departments.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

House, Senate approve budget;

governor must act by March 22

he Pennsylvania House
, U and Senate have approved

Gov. Ed Rendell’s state
budget, which proposes cutting
Pitt’s state appropriation by 5
percent for the ﬁscal year that
begins July 1.

Nonetheless, the 5 percent
reduction isn’t a done deal yet,
Pitt’s assistant director of Com-
monwealth, City and County
Relations told the University
Senate budget policies commit-
tee (BPC) March 14.

“We may end up getting hit
with the 5 percent cut,” Charles
F. McLaughlin said. “Or, the
governor may veto this budget
or part ofit, and the picture might
change.”

Rendell was expected to veto
parts of his own $2 1' billion
spending plan today (March
20), sending it back to the state
legislature. _ _

To understand why Peiinsyl-
vania’s new governorwould reject
a budget he proposed, a rehash of
recent events is in order:

0 Rendell unveiled his spend-
ing. plan on March 4, meeting a
deadline mandated by the state’s
constitution to submit a balanced
budget. That budget calls for cut-
ting $l.6 billion in expenses to
help close a projected $2.4 bil-

. , lion revenue shortfall. Hardest hit

were state-supported universities
(including Pennsylvania’s state-

related schools:,_Pitt,lPen_n S,ta_te,:_L_

Ternple and LiiicZi5liii),i' iiiiiidieal
assistance programs, libraries
and other publicly funded pro-
grams.

0 Rendell urged legislators to
delay voting on his budget until
after March 25, when he plans
to announce a follow—up series
of initiatives for economic devel-
opment, property tax relief and
increased funding for -schools.
Tax increases probably will be
required to fund the initiatives,
Rendell has said.

0 Ignoring the Democratic
governor’s request and moving
with near—record speed, the
Republican-controlled House
and Senate approved Rendell’s
$21 billion spending plan on
March 6 and 12, respectively.
Voting was almost exclusively

' along party lines.

Republican leaders‘ said that
quick passage of Rendell’s initial,
balanced budget would give legis-
lators plenty of time to study the
governor’s upcoming proposals,
while making substantial tax hikes
less likely. ‘

Democrats accused Republi~ ,

cans of bypassing public hearings
and serious legislative consider-
ation of the budget. Sen. Jim
Ferlo, D—Highland Park, called
the move “a complete abortion
of the public process.”

Pitt’s annual hearing before
the House appropriations com-
mittee, which had been scheduled
for next week,»has been canceled.
As the University Times went to
press, the Senate appropriations

of the three other state—related A

universities, although McLaugh-
lin said it was doubtful the session
would be held.

Rendell has until March 22
to either sign the budget bill
approved by the legislature,
allow it to become law without

his signature, veto the bill, or cut.

items from the bill before signing
it. Vetoing the bill, all or in part,
would send the budget back "to
the House and Senate for further
debate. S

Pitt lobbyists point out that
the proposed 5 percent cut in the
University’s appropriation would

' reduce Pitt’s state funding to $ 14

million less than it was two years
ago.

“Our position is that it’s not
just this year, it’s the cumula-
tive effect of the last few years
that’s hurting the state—related
institutions,” McLaughlin said.
“Granted, there are a” lot of
entities taking cuts this year, but
they didn’t suffer the severity of
funding reductions that higher

education did in recent years.” ‘ .

Two" years ago, Pitt was
budgeted to receive less than a
1 percent increase. Later" in the
year, another 3 percent of the
University’s funding was frozen
and, ultimately, cut.

Next year’s possible 5 percent
cut would come out of the full
$1 7 6. 7- million appropriation that
Pitt is budgeted to get this year.

A’

frozen 2 percent of the”  I
million, saying, it was necessary .

to head off a budgetdeﬁcit.
Additional freezes aren’t in- the

works yet, McLaughlin said.

“Members [of the legisla-
ture] have told us that, while
the state hasn’t received any
revenue windfalls in the last
two months, they’re not falling
behind. March and April are the
state’s two biggest tax revenue
months. What we’re hearing is,
[state lawmakers] are waiting to
see how thesetwo months go”
before considering any more
funding freezes.

Implementation of Rendell’s
austere, initial budget would
create a domino effect as other
agencies seek to make up for lost
state -revenues at’ Pitt’s expense,
Chancellor Nordenberg warned

meeting. I '

bounce back and the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania’s
coffers will be more ﬂush than
they are today, Chancellor Mark

A.‘ Nordenberg observed at the
beginning of yesterday’s Uni-
versity Senate plenary session
on University healthbeneﬁts.

“But there is no such encour-
aging pattern when it comes to
the costs of health care,” Norden-
berg said. “That cost just keeps
rising and rising and rising,” a
trend that Pitt budget makers are
all too aware of as the University
negotiates a new employee health
insurance contract.

Dramatic increases in the
number of Americans without
health insurance (41 million at
last count) disproportionately
burden the ﬁnances of academic
medical centers like Pitt’s, the
chancellor noted.

“The challenge of effectively
addressing the important matter
of health care beneﬁts has become
a national problem of almost
mythic proportions,” said Nor-
denberg, likening it to the chal-
lenge of untying the mythically
intricate Gordian Knot.

The plenary session’s keynote
speaker, Oakland University eco-
nomics professor Sherman T.

Folland, promptly showed that
he’s no Alexander the Great.
Citingresearch by himself and
his fellow health economists, Fol-

I f history is any guide, eventu-

land methodically knocked the
props out from under the more
popular, suggested remedies for
runaway health insurance costs.
These included:

0 Make “health care insti-
tutions more efﬁcient. The
average U.S. hospital is 80-90
percent efficient, well above

the average for some other key.

industries, Folland said. During
the 1994 debate over the Clin-
ton administration’s proposed
national health plan, economists
concluded that “there was little
that could be gained by squeezing
more efﬁciency out of hospitals,”
Folland said.

° Stop price gouging by
insurance companies. For
people who get their health
insurance through group plans,
as the vast majority ‘of insured
Americans do, the “loading fee”
(the portion of an insurance
premium that does not go back
to patients in the form of health
care)_ represents just 15 cents .of
every $1 in premiums — a rate
that hardly qualiﬁes as gouging,
Folland said. For individual cov-
erage the loading fee averages a
whopping 50 percent, but only
a small portion of the public is
self-insured, he noted.

° Cut drug costs.While some
drug companies are as proﬁtable,
percentage-wise, as Microsoft,
they are not monopolistic by
nature and they face formidable

bottlenecks in developing drugs,

from the lab to the marketplace,
said F olland. Drug costs con-
stitute 10 percent of total U.S."
health care costs, compared to the

' 2 1 percent that goes to physicians

and 43 percent to hospitals and
nursing homes. “If all drug costs
were reduced to zero, it would
still save just 10 percent in terms

ofoverall health care costs,” Fol— ‘

land said.

0 Increase competition.
“Competition sounds -good
to every economist,” Folland‘
said. “But it’s a big question
how much it applies to health
care.” For one thing, a competi-
tive market requires consumers
who are well informed about the
services they’re buying. But doc-
tors know far more about health
care than patients do, Folland
pointed out.‘ , _

0 Use less health care. “The

main way to save money on health

‘care is to use less of it,” he said.

“But do we really want to do that?

We spend aboutl 5 percent of our -

national income on health care.‘_
Is that too much, really? Richer
nations spend more on health
care, and we’re the richest sub-
stantial nation in the world.”
Americans like having access
to top-notch hospitals and sophis-
ticated technology, Folland said.
And, like Dylan Thomas, most
of us have no intention of going
gently into that good night; yet,
health care costs during a person’s
lastyear of life tend to dwarf what

was spent on their health during
all of the precedingyears. “Do we
really want to spend less on end-
of—life care?” F olland asked.

. Americans have long admired
Canada’s national health system
(less so in recent years, when that
system’s costs and inefﬁciencies
began increasing), Folland noted.
“We’ve found that Canadians
come across the border to use
our health care in times of dire
need,” he said, mainly because
high-tech equipment is com-
paratively plentiful here. For
example, the United ‘States has
3.7 open-heart technology units
per million people, compared
with 1.3 units-per-rnillion people
in Canada. “You can get access to
radiation therapy and MRI scans
almost at any time” in the United

'_'States, Folland said.

Folland’s advice to Pitt?

Considering that American
workers sacrifice 85 cents in
wages for every $1 they receive
in health care, he said, employers
should give employees ﬁnancial
incentives to choose low-cost
health plans — which tradition-
ally has been the case here, as Pitt
staff and faculty have paid less for
managed care coverage than for
options with greater freedom of
choice in physicians and care
received. .

denberg noted. “Pitt has been
largely insulated from dramatic
increases in health insurance costs
over the last three years because
of our agreement with UPMC
Health Plan,” he said. “But that
contract is expiring this year, and
we almost certainlywill be receiv-
ing another close of economic
reality on that front.”

universities “also is sobering,”
the chancellor said. He noted

that Stanford, an elite private '

endowment, recently announced

.an institution—wide salary freeze

and selected layoffs to help close
a.projected $25 million deﬁcit.
Stanford ofﬁcials blamed the
shortfall on “a reduction in
income due primarily to a weak
stock market” and “increased
costs due to a volatile health
care environment.” A

Pitt faces “real challenges,”
Nordenberg, said. “Fortunately,
we have built a level of insti-
tutional strength — and that
includes ﬁscal strength '-‘over
the course of the last several
years. That means we are much
better positioned to deal with an
inhospitable environment. » _

“I really am a ﬁrm believer that
the greatest comparative progress
that an institution can make is,

issues we need to confront will

PNC chairman discusses corporate ethics

ccording to James E.
Rohr, his company,
NC Financial Ser-

vices Group, has no ethical or
corporate accountability prob-
lems. Unlike some corporations
that focus only on shareholders’
proﬁts, PNC’s “core mission” is
to serve four interwoven constitu-
encies: shareholders, customers,
employees and the community,
Rohr said, a goal that helps
ensure accountability checks
and balances. ,

“If you don’t serve all four of
those constituencies, you don’t
have a good long-term future,
especially in a bank.” 1

Rohr,_who has been at PNC
since 1972 in a number of
capacities before rising to chief
executive ofﬁcer in 2000 and
chairman in 2001, spoke March

Contrast that, he said, with
PNC, which earned $1.2 billion
in.after-taxes proﬁts in 2002
— more than any company in

_ Rohr praised recent federal
corporate accountability leg-

requirements were already in

effect at PNC prior to the leg-

islation. “For example, a lot has
been made of the CEO taking
accountability by signing an afﬁ-
davit that says they aren’t aware of
any fraud. I’ve been signing off on

demonstrated the workers’ com-
mitment to social responsibility.
“We’re a bank. If we don’t give
back to our community, our
community won’t prosper, and
we won’t‘ do very well either.”
Rohr downplayed recent
corporate scandals, which he
said have unfairly demonized
corporate leaders as a class. VVhile
there have been a few bad apples,
he said, other problems stem from
gray areas only recently clariﬁed
by legislation and enforced pro-
cedures, and a highly competitive
corporate culture that pressures
companies into primarily beneﬁt-
ing stockholders.
Rohracknowledgéd that some
CEOs’ paychecks were out—of—
line in relation to the health of
their companies. “There’s been
a lot of focus on compensation
and a lot of publicity on that. For
the most part corporate America
and boards of directors are pretty

, conscientious about compensa-

tion. Our company, for example,

I employs two non—salaried inde-

pendent services to make sure

Rohr added that a biased
media will focus on certain non-
representative examples. Often a
CEO needs a heftycompensation
package to be lured away _to help
a struggling company, he said,
because CE_Os have to sacriﬁce

Epidemiologist Lewis H.
Kuller will be honored with a

‘ “Festschrift” March 2 8and 29 to

celebrate his contributions to the
understanding and prevention of
many chronic diseases, particu-
‘larly cardiovascular disease.
The events will bring together

current and former colleagues,

students and friends to pay
tribute to Kuller and to mark
his 30-year chairmanship of the
Department of Epidemiology at
the Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH).

Kuller recently stepped down
as chair in order to devote his
attention to heading the depart-
ment’s Center for Healthy Aging

and pursuing his own research
interests.

The Festschrift (a German
term connoting a celebration)
will include a March 28 recep-
tion, dinner and “roast”; March
29 events include a day of sci-
entiﬁc papers delivered by some

of the nation’s leading ﬁgures in .

public health and epidemiology,
and a evening cocktail party at
the Andy Warhol Museum with
proceeds beneﬁting the Lewis H.
Kuller Scholarship Fund.

Kuller came to Pitt as chair
of the epidemiology department
in 1972. He changed the depart-
ment’s focus from infectious dis-
eases to chronic diseases.

The many major research
programs Kuller developed at
GSPH over the years began
with cardiovascular disease and
hypertension; subsequently he
started programs in women’s
health, diabetes, cancer, aging,
dementia and the role of inflam-
mation in various diseases.

Pitt’s School of Law has

named Richard Delgado, a
leader of the critical race theory
movement, the inaugural Derrick
A. Bell Fellow and Professor of
Law, and Jean Stefancic, legal
writer, the DerrickA. Bell Scholar
and Research Professor of Law.
The appointments will be effec-
tive in May.

Delgado, currently the Jean
Lindsley Professor of Law at
the University of Colorado at
Boulder School of Law, and

- ‘associate at Colorado,"are mar-

ried. They serve as co-editors of
the New_York University Press
series “Critical America.”

They also wrote “Critical
VVhite Studies: Looking Behind
the Mirror” (Temple Univer-
sity Press, 1997), which won a
Gustavus Myers award as the
outstanding book on human
rights in North America in

 

1998. In addition, they shared a
1993 Rockefeller Bellagio grant

.'(Westview Press, 1994).

The positions at Pittare
named for Derrick A. Bell, a
1957 graduate of Pitt’s law school.
Bell is known for resigning from
his tenured faculty» position at
Harvard to protest a lack of
minority women faculty "mem-
bers. His book “Race, Racism
and‘American Law,” 4th edition
(Aspen Law & Business,.2000),

helped to launch the critical race .

theory movement.
Delgado is a founding

books have received numerous
national prizes. “The Coming
Race War” (New York Univer-
sity Press, 1996)" was the Ameri-
can Library Association Choice
OutstandingAcademic Book, and
“The Rodrigo Chronicles” (New
York University Press, 1995) was
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in
1995.-Both books also won the

James Lindgren’s “The Most
Proliﬁc Law Professors in the
Most—Cited Law Reviews” has
ranked Delgado ﬁrst among the
nation’s approximately 5,500 law
professors.
Stefancic writes about civil
rights, law reform, social change

and legal scholarship. Her 1996_

book, “No Mercy: How Conser-

vative Think Tanks and Founda— ’

tions Changed America’s Social
Agenda,” was recommended by
the New York Law Journal as a
“clarion ‘call to "those""‘0‘f us who"
have too "long remained com-
placent that things will return
to the more humane thinking of
the bygone Great Society.”.

Faculty and staff from the
Schools of the Health Sciences
and the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center received three
of the seven Health Care Hero
Awards presented March 6 by the
Pittsburgh Business Times. This

School of Public Health, received
the health care irmovationand
research award for her ground-
breaking research into a little-
understood disorder that affects
up to 7 percent of women: poly-
cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Previously treated on a symp-
tom—by—symptom basis by physi-
cians unaware that a larger and
more complicated disorder was
present, PCOS is increasingly
being recognized as a lifelong
hereditary reproductive endo-
crine condition with physical"
and emotional consequences,
including early development of
cardiovascular disease. I

Steven Kanter, vice dean of
the School of Medicine, won in
the health care educator category.
In 1992, Kanter developed the

all performance of the American

0 health care system at 3 7th among

the 191 U.N. member countries,
just between Costa Rica and Slo-
venia,” said MacLeod.

“In fact, the United States fails
to meet the standards of health
systems available in almost all of
the rest of the developed world,”
he continued. “For example, the
United Kingdom, oft criticized
for long waits for medical
procedures, ranks 18th when
measuring overall health system

performance, compared to the V

U.S. ranking of 37th.”
Defending Canada’s recently
maligned system, MacLeod

cited WHO data revealing that
the U.S. ranks below its northern
neighbor in rates of infant mortal-
ity and life expectancy.
MacLeod argued that a
national health care system
would eliminate or substantially
constrain such inﬂationary fac-
tors as exorbitant proﬁts by
proprietary nursing homes;
out—of-control liability awards;
fraud by hospitals, physicians
and managed care companies,
and what he called “the regu-
latory administrative costs for
conducting business under the
most unnecessarily multi—fac-

eted and bewildering private ‘

health ﬁnancing system in the
world.”

He called on Pitt’s Faculty
Assembly to take the lead in
advocating a national health
care system. “Because acaderni—
cians are highly respected and
represent some 9,000 institu-

. tions of higher learning across

the nation, the faculty of these
schools couldvhave a profound
impact on such an important
issue,” MacLeod said.

He comparedvfaculty advo-
cacy of national health insurance
to the recent friend-of-the—court

UPMC wins 2 achievement awards

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center (UPMC) has
received two achievement awards
from the Hospital & Healthsys-
tem Association of Pennsylvania
(HAP) for its efforts to protect
patients, hospital staff and the
general community against bio-
terrorism.

TheHAPachievementawards
program recognizes health care
professionals who have developed
innovative, adaptable projects
that enhance patient satisfaction

and health care quality, and that

produce cost savings and other
efﬁciencies. W

UPMC received one award
in the communications strate-
gies category for its “Combating
Bioterrorism Through Effective

I .1 . Communications7Z:.-;plan, :»which. -

enacted the UPMC MedCall

Terrorism Response and Infor-
mation Center shortly after the

Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks."

MedCall, originally devel-

,oped by UPMC l4years ago, is an

extensive 24/7 physician—tracking
system that includes immediate
contact information for more
than 11,000 UPMC physicians.
Containing more than 400 on-
call schedules, MedCall is consid-
ered among the largest electronic
physician—tracking systems in the
United States.

UPMC received a second
award in the employee relations
category for its “Bioterror—
ism Preparedness: Safety Link
———- Training-for Staff.”

Safety Link, which was
developed by the UPMC Bio-

_ «..£@m-Qrism..Preparedness..Group_§.

communications task. force, _ is a

series of educational sessions to
help managers and staff better
understand their role in the event
of a disaster or emergency. The
Safety Link program is designed
to include detailed information
on how to respond to a speciﬁc
disaster, whether natural or
humanmade. . ‘

To date, more than 16,000
UPMC employees have received
training in bioterrorism pre-
paredness. The training was
specific to each department and
included everyone from parking
attendants, security guards

and hospital administrators to
emergency medicine personnel. ’

Additionally, nearly 500 UPMC
staff identiﬁed as emergency ﬁrst
responders received specialized

schools in support of the Uni-
versity of Michigan’s afﬁrmative
action policies. “I do think that
with some publicity, Faculty
Assembly could stand up and
actually take this and make it
into a national issue,” MacLeod
said. -

Fellow panelist Nathan Her-
shey, a Pitt professor of health law,
remembered attending a 1961
brieﬁng by a Kennedy admin-
istration ofﬁcial who outlined
a Congressional bill proposing
the Medicare system. “Quite
frankly,” Hershey said, “after
[the ofﬁcial] left, my thoughts

were: ‘This will never happen,
but it was nice to be asked what
we thought about it.’ And then,
lo and behold — it took a presi-
dential assassination to really get
things going on Medicare. . .but
it happened.”

Fallon said he favored a
national health care plan mod-
eled after the systems by which
states require every driver to have
auto insurance — and then see
to it that basic coverage remains
affordable. (Some Republican
leaders also favor such a system,
Fallon noted.)

A virtual groundbrean

Pitt ofﬁcials and local and communityleaders, including Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg and Allegheny County Chief Executivejames
Roddey, lined up in hard hats, grabbed shovels, scooped up real dirt
and tossed it toward a projection screen — all indoors at Alumni Hall
— simulating a groundbreaking for Pitt’s new Biomedical Science
Tower 3 (BST3). ' -

As they did so, the screen image of an empty lot on Fifth Avenue
faded into a 10—story limestone-and-glass building, where in 2005
Pitt expects to open a state-of-the-art biomedical facility.

Holding the March 6 event inside saved the participants from
the frigid weather for what Nordenberg called Pitt’s ﬁrst ever virtual
groundbreaking. . I '

Actual construction of the $188 million building — designed by
Boston’s Payette Associates Inc., in association with the Pittsburgh
firmJSA— is scheduled to begin nextrnonth on Fifth Avenue between
Darragh and Lothrop streets.

A grant of $10.8 million to Pitt, funded equally by the Scaife
Family Foundation and the DSF Charitable Foundation, will partially
support the construction. A matching gift of $10-million from the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) also will support
the project.

BST3’s seventh ﬂoor is thefuture home of the laboratories of
the Pittsburgh Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases (PIND),
which will integrate, coordinate and support education and medi-
cal research in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers
disease, Parkinson’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease, stroke and other
related disorders. In addition tobeing the home of PIND’s labora-
tories, BST3 will house some 50 research groups and 500 scientists
in state-of-the-art biological research and specialized laboratories
for structural biology, synthetic chemistry, computational biology,
and- genomics and proteomics facilities. ' I

Migraines '
often not ’
diagnosed
correctly,
researcher says

Migraine headaches, suf-
fered by millions of Americans
and debilitating for many, are
signiﬁcantly under-diagnosed
by physicians, according to a
Pitt neurologist writing in the
March 19 issue of the Journal
of the American Medical Asso-
ciation.

“A review of a number of
studies suggests that far more
people actually suffer migraine
headaches than popularly
thought,” said Robert Kaniecki,
assistant professor and director
of the Headache Center at the
University of Pittsburgh Medi-
cal Center. “Many people who
are diagnosed as having ‘tension’
or ‘sinus’ headaches are, in fact,
suffering migraines.”

Migraine is a signiﬁcant public

health problem, with more than

2 8 million sufferers in the United
States. More women than men
have migraines, as 18 percent
of women and 6 percent of
men report having a migraine
at some point. The cost to the
U.S. economy is approximately
$17 billion annually in health
care and lost labor costs.
Treatments for acute attacks

can include the use of high
doses of non—steroidal and.
anti-inﬂammatory drugs such
as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen,

I tolfenamic acid or a combination

of acetaminophen, aspirin and
caffeine. Also, migraine-speciﬁc
medications such as those from a
family of drugs known as triptans
also are frequently used and are
considered to be the most effec-
tive products on the market.
According to Kaniecki, pre-
scription and non-prescription
products are used by 9 percent of
the population to treat headaches

‘ each week, matching hyperten-

sion as the most-treated medical
condition.

One of the most over-
diagnosed forms of headache,
Kaniecki said, is the sinus
headache, which he says exists
only in theory. Recent research
has shown that the majority of
patients diagnosed with sinus

- headache actually have headaches

meeting criteria for migraine.
“The United States is the only
country in the world to have such
a thing as ‘sinus headache.’ A
study done in 2002 showed that
of 3,038 people who reported

-. .t.ha.t_ they had.  .1.1.e.%.ir1a.c1As:.s,..:...

only eight actually had sinus
infections,” Kaniecki said.
“Over 50 percent of patients with
migraine are undiagnosed, and in

. this group, 42 percent carry the

label of ‘sinus headache’and 32
percent the diagnosis of ‘tension
headache.”’

The result of the over—diag—
nosis of sinus‘ headaches is an
excessive number of prescriptions
written to treat the phantom sinus
infection, including mass’ doses
of antibiotics and decongestants.
This, he said, may be a major con-
tributor to antibiotic resistance.

A primary reason for the
under-diagnosis is a lack of phy-

sician education, he said.

The tools for assessing head-
ache are most important so that
the physician and patient can
work together to determine the
best diagnosis and treatment.

“The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd out
if there are secondary origins of

‘ headache, such as a brain tumor

or aneurysm. We then assess the
patient for a primary headache
subtype such as migraine, ten-
sion, or cluster,” Kaniecki said.

“Once that step is complete,
we assess the frequency of epi-
sodes to determine whether
the patient has an episodic or
chronic form of this headache,”
he added.

The International Headache
Society deﬁnes chronic headache
as attacks that occur more fre-
quently than 15 days a month for
more than 6 months. More than
4 percent of adults in the U.S.
suffer from chronic headaches
that are daily or near—daily.

“Episodic tension-type head-
ache annually affects some 38
percent of U.S. adults, yet rarely
requires medical attention given

the typical absence of disability or

V concerningsymptoms,”Kaniecki

said. The pain is generally mild to
moderate, usually bilateral, and
non—throbbing, with stress as the
most common trigger.
“Migraine symptoms may be
quite variable,” he said. Although
typically seen as a one—sided
throbbing headache associated
with nausea and sensitivities to
light and noise, migraine also
magggbeagsociated with neck
pain or sinus drainage and con-
gestion. ;
“If one has a stable pattern
of disabling headache occur-

' ring as episodes over months to

years, it almost always represents
migraine,” Kaniecki said.

Can survival for patients who

Emergency medicine
researchers are participating in
a local, one-year research study
known as the Vasopressin in

Researchers will collaborate with
City of Pittsburgh paramedics,
who will administer the drug.

Pittsburgh paramedic crews

receive vials containingvasopres—
sin and half of the paramedics
will receive vials containing
saline (salt water). None of the
paramedics will know whether
the vials contain the active drug
or the saline. '

The paramedics will perform

their current standard of care for

adrenaline (epinephrine) and,
additionally, will administer the
contents of the research vial. It is

pressin in addition to their regular
treatment. The researchers hope
to give vasopressin to 162 patients
in cardiac arrest. A total of 324
people may participate in the
study.

When paramedics are called
to the scene of a patient in car-
diac arrest, they typically provide
advanced tools to help the patient
breathe and administer drugs like
epinephrine to help promote
blood ﬂow to the heart, making
it more likely to resume beating.
Currently, the only blood ﬂow-
promoting drug approved for use
by paramedics is epinephrine.

During the vasopressin study,
an emergency medicine physician
from Pitt will ride with paramed-
ics in the ambulance. It is part
of the required training for
emergency medicine residents
at Pitt.

Information gathered during
the study will enable research-
ers to examine whether there is
any change in the proportion of
victims whose hearts restart after
receiving the vasopressin.

tion from sudden cardiac arrest,

vasopressin may eventually win '

approval for use by all paramed-
ics,” said Clifton W. Callaway,
assistant professor of emergency
medicine at Pitt’s School ofMedi—

. cine and principal investigator of

the vasopressin study. “It is neces-

' sary to conduct this study in the

out-of—hospital setting because
victims of cardiac arrest often
arrive at the hospital too late for
the drug to do any good.”

Recent studies in Canada
and Europe have shown that
vasopressin was equivalent or
superior to adrenaline when
used as a treatment for cardiac
arrest. Based on these studies, the
American Heart Association rec-
ommends vasopressin as the drug
to be considered for the treatment
of cardiac arrest. However, it is
unknown whether vasopressin is
helpful when used for victims of
cardiac arrest under conditions
like those encountered by para-
medics in the United States.

According to federal law and
Pitt policy, those who participate
in clinical research must provide
informed consent. Because of the
nature of this trial, itis impossible
to obtain consent at the time of
cardiac arrest. Researchers are

consent will be waived and will

Acupuncture
for’ end-stage
colorectal '
cancer patients.
studied

Colorectal cancer patients
with end—stage disease often

I suffer from physical and psycho-

logical symptoms that negatively
affect their quality of life and
require frequent hospital stays.
The intensity of these symptoms
can prevent patients from taking
full advantage of their limited
time with family and friends.
Investigators at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute’ (UPCI) are testing the
use of acupuncture in alleviat-
ing symptom distress in people
with advanced colon cancer.
The study is supported by a $1.2
million grant from the National
Institutes of Health. In order to

determine whether acupuncture ,

helps people with colon cancer,
some study participants receive
acupuncture and others do not.

“For many terminally ill ’

colorectal cancer patients, their
ﬁnal months are marred by dis-
tressing physical symptoms,” said
Ellen M. Redinbaugh, princi-
pal investigator of the study and
assistant professor of medicine in
Pitt’s Department of Behavioral
Medicine. “These symptoms can
be overwhelming for the more
than 5 0,000 colorectal cancer
patients who die every year in the
United States. Their alarmingly
high rates of hospitalization for
symptom management near the
end of life indicate a clear need for
new interventions to ameliorate
their distress and promote their
quality of life.”

A Acupuncture has been used in
traditional Chine_se medicine for
2,500 years to prevent and treat
illness. It is widely practiced in
the United States as a therapeu-
tic intervention for a variety of
health conditions. The theo-
retical basis for acupuncture is
that disruptions in energy ﬂow
(Qi) cause illness. and disease,

or an imbalance between the

complementary life energies,
Yin and Yang. Acupuncture is
said to correct the imbalances
of energy flow and promote
optimal health. It relies on the
insertion of thin surgical needles
into speciﬁc points close to the
surface of the skin (acupoints) to
stimulate energy ﬂow.

“Acupuncture has been used

successﬁilly to reduce pain, but
there is a lack of well—designed
studies that compare it to

other treatment modalities in

this patient population,” com-
mented Andrew Baum, profes-
sor of psychiatry and psychology
and UPCI’s deputy director for
cancer control and population
sciences.

The current study will evalu-

ate the efﬁcacy of acupuncture"

to improve quality of life, pro-

’mote emotional well—being and

decrease physical symptom dis-
tress among colorectal patients
with a life expectancy of six
months or less..One hundred
and seventy patients with meta-
static colorectal cancer will be
recruited for the study through

the UPCI’s gastrointestinal"

oncology department. Patients
will be randomly assigned to one
of three groups. The ﬁrst group
will receive “true” acupuncture
in which needles will be inserted
at acupoints. A second group will
receive “sham” acupuncture, or
the insertion of needles at loca-
tions on the body that do not
represent actual acupoints. The
ﬁnal group will receive usual care
without acupuncture.
Colorectal cancer_is second
only to lung cancer in numbers
of cancer-related deaths in the

' United States. If detected early,

it is highly curable.

Any degree of post—concus—

sion headache in high school

athletes even one week after
injury likely is associated with
incomplete recovery, indicat-
ing the need to keep theathlete
from returning to contact play
until headache and all other
post—concussion symptoms
resolve, according to a study

by the University of Pittsburgh A

Medical Center (UPMC) Sports
Medicine Concussion Program
published in the March—April
2003 issue of The American
Journal of Sports Medicine.

In the study, concussed high

school athletes with any degree

of headache at one week post-
injury also had signiﬁcantlymore
other post—concussion symptoms
and performed more poorly on
neurocognitive tests measuring
reaction time and memory than
concussed athletes who reported
no headache at one week post-
injury.

Athletes with headaches one
week post-injury also were four
times more likely to have expe-

A rienced memory loss and other

symptoms on the playing ﬁeld
immediately after the injury,
and were ﬁve times more likely

to experience on—the—ﬁeld symp— .

toms that lasted longer than ﬁve
minutes. Thus, the presence of
head_ache.a_1_So  f<1S.Soc,iat6d.vyitl1
more severe COnCuSSlOn.

“Our study results suggest
that headaches in concussed
high school athletes be taken-
seriously,” said - principal inves-
tigator Michael W. Collins, a
neuropsychologist and assistant

1 director of UPMC Sports Medi-

cine Concussion Program. “An

"athlete with post—concussion

headache should receive further
evaluation before being allowed
to return to play. Headache cer-
tainly appears to be associated
with lingering problems and
incomplete brain recovery fol-

_ lowing concussion.”.

“The signiﬁcance of headache
after sports—related concussion is
often _questioned because of the
high frequency of headaches

among athletes who have not sus-
tained concussions, ’~’ said Melvin
Field, studyinvestigator and chief
resident in UPMC’s Department
of Neurological Surgery. “Even
though as many as 86 percent of
athletes with concussion report
post-injury ‘headache, until this
studythere has been no published
study examining whether post-
concussion headache is associated
with neurocognitive impairment
and other symptoms, thus sugges-

‘ tive of incomplete recovery.”

“We are concerned about

returning a concussed athlete to
play before the brain has had time
to heal, given that the effects of a
second concussion may be more
harmful and serious,” said Mark
R. Lovell, study investigator and
director of UPMC’s concussion
program. “Most athletes who
sustain an initial concussion can
recover completely as long as they
are not returned to contact sports
too soon.

“The problem is that concus-
sion symptoms are not. always
straightforward and not always
reported by the athlete. Evalu-
ation of the injury’s effects and
knowing when it is safe to return
the athlete to play can be difﬁcult
to measure objectively,” Lovell
added.

An estimated 63,000 high
school athletes sustain a con-
cussion each year. A concussion
occurs when the brain is violently
rocked back and forth inside the
skull due to a blow to the head
or upper body, much like an
egg; yolk inside an eggshell.

Concussion is a trauma-induced

alteration of mental status that

may or may not result in loss of
consciousness. Other symptoms
may include headache, disori-
entation, confusion, dizziness,
amnesia and uncoordinated
'hand—eye movements.

' The UPMC researchers
reviewed the cases of 109 high

school athletes_ who sustained '

concussions during the 2000-

_ 2001 school year. The athletes

were divided into two groups on
the basis of self-reported head-
ache at one week post-injury

evaluation. Seventy—three of the _
?ath.1e.t.¢s.’ reverted I.19,.,.h¢ac1aChe

while '3 6 athletes‘ relporfeld 'vari—
ous degrees of headache. At that
time a neurocognitive function
test was administered to all study
participants to compare headache

presence to objective neurocog— _

nitive function data. Athletes
with postconcussion headaches
had signiﬁcantly slower reac-
tion times and reduced memory
performance as measured by the
neurocognitive test scores.

The test used in the evaluation
was ImPACT (Immediate Post-
concussion Assessment and Co g-

nitive Testing), a 2 0-minute com-’

puter assessment tool developed
by the UPMC sports concussion
researchers. ImPACT includes

tests of mental function such in

as attention, .memorj§ reaction
time and information processing

speed. Some 2 50 high schools use '

ImPACT to objectively evaluate

‘the effects of‘ concussion and

more accurately determine when
it is safe for an athlete to return
to Contact play. A .
The athletes in the studywere
from 20 high schools in Pennsyl-
vania, Michigan, Illinois, Oregon
and Maine. The majority were
football players, while the rest
represented basketball, soccer,

‘ hockey, lacrosse, softball, track,

volleyball and wrestling;
