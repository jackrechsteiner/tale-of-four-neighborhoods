Students find an alternative to typical spring break

KEVIN FUNK
Staff Writer

At a time when many students continued to sleep away
the memories of the last week’s rnidterrns, or were just tuck-
ing themselves in after a night .of Cancun debauchery, a
group of Pitt Alternative Spring Break participants had their
own vacation slumber suddenly intenupted by a call to arms.

“Yeah! All right! Let’s build some trail! French toast!”
came the  6:19 a.m. wake-up yell of Cumberland
Trail Conference Program Coordinator Mark Stanﬁll, wield-
ing the tantalizing promise of a French toast breakfast to coax
the volunteers out of bed and onto the trails.

As part of Pitt’s ASB program — which included
numerous other trips, such as tutoring Navajo children in
Arizona and working with Habitat for Humanity in Hawaii
— the 12-person group traveled to Soddy-Daisy, Tenn., to
help construct a segment of the Cumberland Trail, which
eventually will span over 300 miles through 11 eastern
Tennessee counties.

Joined by other college students from Michigan State
University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Emory

‘ University, lllinois State University and an assortment of

other volunteers, the 11 Pitt students and one staﬂ member
spent the week carving, digging and evening out a four—foot-
wide by eight—foot—tall hiking space through the rolling, rock-
and tree-ﬁlled Cumberland Valley.

Organized into teams of about 10, the road-cone,
orange—vest—clad volunteers took turns sweeping away dried
and crackling leaves with a ﬁre rake, pruning stray branches
with hand clippers, battling tree roots with a mattock —— sirn—
ilar to a pickax — and sending weighty slabs of sandstone
out of the trail’s path and careening down the hillside.

“Rock!” the obligatory accompanying warning echoed.

In addition to the several daily—anointed leaders within
each team — referred to as “lVI11le Skinners” ———- groups also
had an overall leader called a “Wagon Master,” an experi-
enced volunteer whose duty was to oversee progress and
motivate the volunteers.

“This tree’ll have to come down,” said Wagon Master
Jim Schroeder, a 71-year-old New Jersey transplant to the
South and former triple bypass patient who had to be con-
tinuously nagged by his group members to eat lunch after
tirelessly working away the moming and early afternoon.

How’s that for motivation?

But if Schroeder’s dedication to building the
Cumberland Trail was remarkable, it was not without paral-
lel.

Fellow Wagon Master Shawn Basil, a 30-something ex-

Marine who’s rippling, muscled physique suggested that he ,

spends his weekends pulling 18—wheelers on ESPN specials,
paused for all of 10 secondsafter dislocating his thumbto
grimace in pain, shove it back into position, and continue
working, much to the opened—jaw amazement of those
around him.
“It happens,” he said.

But the trip wasn’t all about dislocated thumbs, chop-'

ping tree roots, and carefully removing ticks while -in the
shower —— it was also intended to be a learning experience.

Once a day, a park ranger would meet with students to
discuss local ﬂora, fauna and . history — including ﬂre
region’s economic transformation from coal to peaches, and
now, apparently, college spring break haven.

The learning and working of trail time ended daily at 3 1

p.m., when minivans full of physically drained volunteers
began the winding 40-minute drive back to home-away-
from-dorm—room Dogwood Lodge.

Free until dinner time at 5 p.m., participants took advan-

tage of the Lodge’s plush Christrnas-gree —and—red plaid‘
couches to grab a quick nap, scan meaty tomes of global eco-
nomic history — “my professor recommended it,” said the
reader of Jared Diarnond’s ‘fGuns, Germs, and Steel” ——- or
play a few games of Hearts. “America’s Spirit,” the “Family

. Game for Patriotic Americans” sat unused on a comer shelf.

The more energetic took advantage of the outdoor bas-

' ketball court’s 9—foot, slanted rim to hold a dunk competition

or convened on a nearby perfectly ﬂat grass lakeside ﬁeld to
play a]l—out, 11-on—1 1, diving-and-knee—bloodying games of
soccer and Ultimate Frisbee.

Entertainment for the week, however, culminated with

Friday r1ight’s square dance, a several-hour ﬁddle» fest of ,

frenzied dancing and partner swinging, the sound of which
penetrated the Lodge’s stretching conidors and deep brown
wood-paneled walls.

It was a distinctively Souﬂrem event in a distinctively R
Southern trip, from the roadside Fireworks Supermarket, the

ubiquitous Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, the Chattanooga

‘ barbecue ribs and OutKast’s “Hey Ya” thumping ad nause-

am from the Dodge Grand Caravan’s speakers.

But, in the end, it was all about ﬂre trail —— a trail con-
ceived in 1998 and scheduled to be completed in 2008, and.
of which the participants constructed 1.1 miles that have left
them with positive memories. _ _

“I like the rewarding aspect of seeing what you’re doing
making a difference,’ ’ said trip participant Phillip Legge, who
actually  a dream about trails after returning home to
Pittsburgh.

“It involved building a trail in the ' concrete around
Towers,” he said. “I think somehow we had to go through
my room, and I remember using a mattoc ”

LORA WOODWARD
Staff Writer

Only one class in Carnegie

Mellon University’s philosophy.

department, Intro to Political
Philosophy, . discusses . feminism,
and for only one day,‘according to
Joanna Tamburino and Leslie
Jumper. P
Unsatisfied with the single—day
discussion, in which they said the
professor only showed the two
extremes of feminists, graduate stu-
dents Tamburino and Jumper started
the Feminist Philosophy Reading
Group this spring semester for a few
reasons. They said that no reading
groups existed in CMU’s philoso-

phy department, and they felt the P

women did not have good interac-
tions with the men in the depart-
ment. .

“There are many shades of fem-
inism,” explained Tamburino, who
says the group tries to stay away
from the political and activist sides

of feminism, instead discussing the
philosophy of feminists. “We are
doing academic feminism.”

“I don't want to say [a feminist
in the 2lst century] is the working
woman, per se, but one who is
autonomous,” Jumper said. “We
want to say it is women who work,
but at the same time, women at
home also face [social injustices].”

The feminist of the 21 st century
claims “autonomy, and takes ‘it

back, since [women] are born with-

out it," Tamburino said,‘ _ ,

Jumper added that the_ most
common misconception. the public
has about feminists is that they are
“man-hating.”

“We are not about blame, but
describing what the state of affairs
is,” Jumper said. it _

Another misconception the

group faces  that philosophy and _ .

the notions are inaccessible to oth-
ers, and there is -no applicationto
real life,” Tamburino said.

Tamburino and Jumper ‘choose
each month’s readings based on cer-
tain issues in moral and political
philosophy that interest them,.Vand
they look at the feminist aspects of
the readings.

The reading groupmet last.

dent of TKE, met with Triggs.

“We admitted to the charges,”
Sample said. “There was no sense in
us lying.”

He also recognized? the impor-
tance of ensuring the new members
of the fraternity have a positive
pledging experience. _

“If they don’t enjoy their pledge
period, they don’t have fun at col-
lege,” Sample said.

When deciding what kind of
pledging activities the fraternity
should have, Sample stressed the
importance of new member safety

“You don’t want to harm a broth-
er,” Sample said.

But Interfraternity Council
President Steve Mihlfried. explained
that his governance group has had no
say in the sanctions imposed on
TKE.

According to Mihlfried, IFC’s
judicial board can only deal with
rush violations. Any violations
regarding hazing must be taken
directly to Pitt’s judicial board. The
judicial board then makes a recom-
mendation for punishment to Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and Dean
of Students Jack Daniel, who makes

punishment for the fraternity.

Daniel said that he does not dis-
cuss judicial matters with the media,
both for confidentiality and for legal
reasons. He added that he could nei-
ther confirm nor deny that TKE’s
recognition had been suspended.
Although he could not say whether
he usually comments upon or
changes the judicial board’s recom-
mendations, he did say that all of the
recommendations eventually come
before him.

According to a letter from
Daniel to Sample, dated Feb. 5,
2004, Sample met with Judicial
Advocate Robert Hellner on.J an. 16,
2004, and accepted responsibility
for six violations of the “University
of Pittsburgh Student Code of
Conduct and Judicial Procedures.”
The items Sample acknowledged,
according to the letter, included
some part of each of the following
violations: furnishing or providing
alcohol to anyone under 21 or any-
one visibly intoxicated; having any-
one under 21 in possession of alco-
hol; and purchasing or using bulk
quantity alcohol — including kegs,
more than six cans of beer per per-
son of legal drinking age, or hard
alcohol and liquor.

acknowledged by Sample, Daniel
addressed in the letter the sanctions
recommended for the fraternity.

“I do not accept the Hearing
Officer’s recommendation from the
Friday, Jan. 30, 2004, hearing that
your chapter be allowed to continue
with your recruitment activities this
calendar year,” Daniel wrote. “I do
uphold the recommended sanction as
set forth in the complaint [filed by
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Birney Harrigan]: suspension" of
recognition of your chapter, effec-
tive Dec. 19. 2003, through Dec. 31,
2004.” '

The hearing officers, according
to the letter, originally recommend-
ed that the fraternity be placed on
probationary status for two years,
beginning Jan. 1', 2004, and that
each current group member be
required to complete 100 hours of
community service by April 15,
2004. — . .

Daniel upheld the 2-year proba-
tion, which he modified to begin on
Jan. 1, 2005 —‘after a year of sus-

pension — and reduced the manda-,

tory community service requirement
from 100 hours to 50 hours.

In addition to the modified sanc-
tions, Daniell upheld the hearing
officers’ recommendations for a

sponsored anti-hazing program, with
“assumption of all fees”; to occur by
March 2005; a minimum of two
brotherhood retreats, “as an alcohol-
free event [sic] with a representative
from alumni, national affiliate
and/or a chapter adviser, to be com-
pleted by April 2005”; and atten-
dance at the Greek Alcohol
Awareness Program, as an annual
condition of fraternity membership.

The letter, which The Pitt News
acquired, was also sent to Sara
Hammond, the manager of the
University Student Judicial System;
Katelyn Miller, of Student Volunteer
Outreach; and Triggs. Triggs left Pitt
on March 3, 2004. ,

“[Triggs] called us into the
office, we had a little conference
with her, [and] we admitted to the
charges so that we could improve
upon our [fraternity] and correct
these things,” Sample said. ;

“The main thing that our chapter
wanted was to still be recognized by
the University and to still be able to
rush,” Sample added. He explained
that TKE, which received its charter
in 1999, has only 13 members and
will suffer from being excluded from
rush for a"year.

Tamburino and Jumper facilitated the
discussion, among four undergradu-
ates, of Monica J. Casper’s article,
“The Making of the Unborn Patient: A
Social Anatomy of Fetal Surgery.”

. Fetal “surgery, as _ defined by
Children’s Hospital Boston’s Web site,
“is the surgical treatment of’ a fetus
with certain life-threatening congenital
abnormalities. Surgical intervention
during pregnancy on the fetus is meant
to correct problems that would be too,
advanced to correct after birt .”

During an ultrasound, doctors can
tell Whether a fetus is not going to
make it to delivery or much longer
after birth.

During the discussion, Tamburino
and ‘Jumper pointed out that the

_woman is not always aware of what

will happen to her body during and

ed as less important, she added.

The group discussed “what is the
person” —. person meaning something
that has rights —— “the fetus or the
mother,” when doctors suggest fetal
surgery? '

“The fetus isn’t a person because
it’s not rational and not legal until it is
born, according to many feminists,”
Jumper said.

“But women choose to do this,”
argued undergraduate Lexi Kamauff.

“Do they have the choice?” asked
Jumper. “You lose yourself as a person
because you are pregnant.”

Kamauff said that the mother
would want to protect her child.

“We’re not against pregnancy,”
Tamburino said. “Because of the way
society is structured, women lose their
-rights because they are pregnant, and
they don’t have a choice .as far as what
society_’s preconceived’ conceptions
are.” T

“Feminism argues that the fetus is
[the woman’s] when [she is] pregnant,
but women are vulnerable because
society says the woman’s fetus is not
just [hers],” said Jumper. “If all
women said the fetus was only theirs

‘and that they had autonomy over it,

then fetal surgery" wouldn’t be a‘ prob-
lem. The problem is most women do
not feel this way.” i ‘

Philiosophicfeminists discuss status of fetus, women’s issues

Women need to be well informed
about the risks and beneﬁts of fetal
surgery, according to Tamburino.

Tamburino and Jumper want to see
their reading group continue after this
semester, since they will be leaving at
the end of the school year. '

“It is good that women think about
these issues, because half of the prob-
lem is, women don’t know about
them,” Jumper said. _ i

The group meets once a month,
with the next discussion coming up on
March 19. Call CMU’s philosophy
department at (412) 268-8568 for more

come.

Daniel overturned judicial board’s

recommendation in favor of Harrigan’s

TKE, page 8

“Dr. Harrigan had it out to get
us,” Sample said. “She threw‘ the
book at us, and everything she could
at us.” p

“The judicial board actually
went in our favor,” Sample said,
“[but]. it was unacceptable to, both

, Birney Harrigani and Jack Daniel."’
Harrigan could not be _c_ontfacted' C

for comment late lastlnight. C 0
According to the recommended
sanctions sent by the judicial board
to Jack Daniel, the board advised
that the fraternity “remain as recog-
nized organization by University”;
“community service 100 hours/cur-
rent member to be completed by
April ‘04”; and “recruitment activi-
ties able to be continued [with]
direct oversight, approval, monitor-

ing of new member activitiesxby .

Fraternity and Sorority . Life

Coordinator and national organiza-r .

tion.” The judicial board also recom-
mended that the fraternity be put on
probationary status from Jan 1,
2004, until Jan. 1, 2007.

The board recommended that the
fraternity attend the Greek Alcohol
Awareness Program annually —— an
event that they had already regis-
tered for this year.

Sample said that, while Triggs
seemed to recognize the work TKE
was doing to improve the situation,
she was not able to hand down the
sanctions she chose. 0

“I felt that she was greatly limit-
ed in what she could do, and that
some of the things Dr. Harrigan
wanted her to.do, she did not agree
with,” Sample added.

“Our campus Greek community
is nothing like it should be,” Sample
said, explaining that he would like
more support and participation at
Greek events.

Sample said no one contacted
him from the time he heard the judi-
cial board’s ruling, until he received
the letter from Daniel overturning
the decision not to suspend TKE. ’

“The judicial process was a
farce,” Sample said. . ‘ ‘ _

TKE’s national chapter does not
have an official policy to revoke
charters from chapters lacking uni-
versity recognition, Sample said,

and Pitt’s chapter will maintain its
national recognition. _

TKE’s national chapter could not
be reached for comment.

“They’re not going to pull a

. chapter from a major university,” he

said, adding that the national organi-

zation has been “very proactive” in

working with the chapter  improve

 ‘‘-We’re still, a fully functional

said. “We don’t . need the
University’s recognition to be a

Although TKE will not be able
to participate in Greek Week events
and is not a member of ‘the
Interfraternity Council until the sus-
pension ends, he expressed opti-
mism about the fraternity’s activity
level.

“stop us from associating and gather-
mg.”
Addressing TKE’s pledging
process, Sample said that pledges
were not forced to take part in any-
thing uncomfortable.

“Our pledges enjoy their pledge
process,” Sample said, explaining
that the fraternity members do not

‘do “anything physical” to pledging

members. ‘ _

Sample expressed, scorn for
unpleasant hazing processes, calling
them “idiotic.” “

He added that he was ‘told he
should have fought the hazing
charges, asneither Brett" Wilson nor
his mother was present at the hear-
ing. , g ‘ A _
In TKE’s pledging process,

jpotential members are required to

wear the fraternity’s' pin, pass five
quizzes on the fraternity’s national
and chapter history, and visit at least
one other T KE chapter to see “how
it functions,” Sample said.

“Anita was very helpful in our
case. She did not want to get rid’ of
[fraternities],” Sample said. “From
what I have” seen from the others,
from [Harrigan] C and Jack ‘Daniel,
they want to, get rid of us.”

EDITORIAL

A bill introduced to the House of
Representatives on March 9 seeks to
adjust, and possibly invalidate, a key por-
tion of the United States Constitution.
The Congressional Accountability for
Judicial Activism Act would, according to
a press release from the bill’s sponsor,
Rep. Ron Lewis, R—Ky., “allow Congress,
by a two-thirds vote in each house, to
override certain future decisions of the
U.S. Supreme Court.”

Under the current system, Court deci-
sions can be overridden in two ways.
Subsequent Court decisions can invalidate
prior ones, such as Brown v. Board of
Education reversing Plessy v. Ferguson.
In addition, Constitutional amendments,
such as the one President Bushsupporting
concerning a ban on gay marriage, can act
to reverse Supreme Court decisions.

Lewis’s bill, which is cosponsored by
Rep. Joe Pitts, R—Pa., and 10 others, would
change these processes, giving Congress
the ability to essentially veto decisions
with which they didn’t agree. Plus, it ques-
tions the validity of Marbury v. Madison,
the 1803 Court decision that established
the right of judicial review and from
which Court decisions gain potency.

Perhaps what Lewis needs is a trip
back to high school history class —-— to
learn about the good old American values
of checks and balances, separation of
powers and the particular ﬂavor of
“democracy lite” that this country prac-
tices. . —

Ky. Rep.’s bill goes against Constitution

The Court is supposed to be an insti-
tution above partisan squabbling and
Congress’ mercurial whims. Moreover,
those appointed as justices must be nomi-
nated by the president and approved by
Congress, which is about as checked and
balanced as a system can get.

Lewis stated that his reasons for the
bill included the judicial branch’s recent
activism and being “disconnected from
the values of everyday Americans,”
according to the press release. Fortunately
for the integration process, in 1954, the
Court was ahead of the “values of every-
day Americans,” some of which included
segregation and anti-miscegenation laws.
It’s the Court’s purpose and duty to effect
change — so long as those changes are in

keeping with the Constitution and its

amendments. ,

And Lewis’s bill seems to miss the
point of Constitutional amendments. In
order to get one passed, it must be called
for by either two-thirds of both the House
of Representatives and Senate or two.-
thirds of state legislatures, and then
approved by three-fourths of state legisla-
tures or constitutional conventions,”
according to Article V of the Constitution.

In other words, it takes a lot of people
lots of time — and what’s more democra-
tic than that?

Perhaps Lewis and his cosponsors
should remember the oath of office they
took and try to support —- and not dis-
mantle — the Constitution.

Say it loud: feminist is not an ‘F’ word .

The conversation is a common one. A
seemingly enlightened, intelligent woman
will amaze you with the ridiculous logic of:
“Oh, I’m not a feminist. I like to cook for my
boyﬁiend and wear makeup and cry at sad
movies, grind to Britney Spears dance
remixes and dress like ﬂre “Sex . and the
City” girls. Nope, I’m not a feminist.”

The reaction is a familiar one. My eye
rolling evolves into seeﬂring disbelief. What
do you mean you’re not a femi-
nist? Pull up your skirt and get
out a hand-held mirror. Is that a
penis? No, it’s not. Ifyou have a
pair of X chromosomes, all this
equality nonsense concerns you.
As a woman, aren’t you auto-
matically a feminist? Sadly, no. .

The term “feminism” has
become a big, nasty F word.
Well F that. You don’t have to be
a militant lesbian to care about
women’s issues. Legally, we are

by hallway groping and nicknames like
“Boobs,” I had a mission. I was going to be
one of ﬂre boys. And I think I almost pulled
it oif. Fortunately, dry sarcasm and a potty
mouth make you .ﬁt- in with the two—nut
crew. But when I went to college, I realized
pretending to be equal wasn’t for me. And
even if it was, self-deluding redheads with
big boobs will never be seen as just “one of
_ the boys.” I had the wisdom
_. and the self-esteem to know
that I could be a raging girly-
girl and an intelligent, capable

often abused or ‘forgotten. The
choice is yours whether or not you protest
injustices against your inalienable rights. But

why wouldn’t you? Fear of ‘feminism is fear.

of unfair stereotyping, fear of judgment and
fear of rejection. We’ve learned that calling
ourselves feminist or aligning ourselves pub-
licly with any pro-woman ideology puts us
at odds with ﬂre men in our lives.

ful man and tell him women still have ajraw

you say it, you’re going to hear over and
over why you’re wrong. So you stop ﬁght-
ing it. I’ve been there. When I was younger,
most of my friends were guys. Back then,
buying into F-word propaganda, I was dis-
gusted that my female friends seemed so,
ugh, feminine — too feminine to be smart or
interesting or even equal.

“do-me” feminists. The fear]
of the ,F'word will not pass
until women realize that there is no arche-
typal feminist to model» one’s selfafter. The
“butch man-hater” stereotype is a “device

time, I will tell you that women are not

always treated equally in many situations, ‘

and there’s a long way to go until we are. I
will do anything required of me to enlighten
others to this fact or work toward ﬁxing it.
And if any random guys try to grab my
boobs ever again, I will calmly punch them
in the stomach and let loose the only legit F

Stating opinion as fact and other conservative tricks

When making an argument for a particular position,
you are always addressing three groups of people: the
group that already agrees with you; the group that will
never agree with you; and third, and by far the smallest but
the most important to your cause, the group that you might
convince to agree with you.

There are two ways to convince mem-
bers of this group that your opinion is cor-
rect. The ﬁrst is to actually present evi-
dence and fresh insight that, together, over-
whelmingly make your case — you know,
actually being right. The second is to make
a bad idea sound good with rhetoric. This
method of argument is one that has been
used with great success by the conservative
right in the United States.

Given how easy it is to convince peo-
ple that a weH-written text equates with a
well-formed idea, it’s important that
Americans, as critical thinkers, be able to
identify these sorts of rhetorical tricks and
see through them. I will use Eric Miller’s
March 1 column on gay marriage, “Marriage and
Financial Incentive about Children,” as it may be already
familiar to The Pitt News’ readership.

There are a number of rhetorical tricks employed by
the right to disguise a bad idea.

1. Stating Opinion as Fact.

Miller states in his column, “the government tends to
help those who help the common goal,” after establishing
in the preceding paragraphs that the “common goal” in
marriage is reproductive — that is, that the primary reason
the government supports marriages is to support effective
American procreation. He says this as though it was a stat-
ed goal of the government, while offering no evidence that
it is anything other than his own view of the role of gov-

“Conservatives give
lip service to
moderate positions
while proponing
conservative ones. ”

emment in regard to marriage.

In fact, the National Center for Health Statistics, a
bureau of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, released on June 25 an article titled, “U.S.
Birthrate Reaches Record Low.” The armouncement

detailed how, according to 2002 statis-
tics, the birth rate in America was 13.9
per 1,000 persons, an all—time low.

cerned with the successful production
of new Americans, it would, upon
hearing these statistics, have shown
great concern and urged the popula-
tion, as the Gaullists did in France, to
begin a campaign of childbirth to pro-
duce more Americans. Of course, it did

- no suchthing, because it does not View
procreation as a primary concern,
despite what Miller may hold as “fact”

2. Comparing Unlike Objects.

This is a favorite technique for
conservatives, and it is frequently
effective. It is the rhetorical art of drawing a comparison
where none should exist. Miller writes, “If a man and a
man are rewarded for love, why can’t a man and two
women be rewarded?” This question does two things: it
misconstrues the actual issue in question in regard to gay

- marriage, and it uses this misdirection to bolster the con-

servative argument at hand.

The question about gay marriage is not one that seeks
to revise the deﬁnition of marriage as a union between two
people; it calls into question what the gender of those two
people may legally be. Therefore, a rhetorical question

Miller might have accurately asked is, “If a man and a,

woman are rewarded for love, why can’t a man and a man
be rewarded?” Another is, “If a man and two women are

If the government were con— '

rewarded for love, why can’t three men be rewarded?” A
combination from these questions is illogical, as it deals
with two different issues — one of composition androne of
quantity. The answer, then, to Miller’s original question is,
“Because there is no logical progression ﬁ'om a two—per—
son, sarne—sex marriage to a tlrree-person, marriage
involving different sexes.”
3. False Moderateness.

This technique is a conservative ruse ﬂrat gives lip ser— ‘

vice to moderate, centrist positions while actually propon-
ingconservative ones. Miller writes, “I’ve decided to carry
that barmer at about half-mast’ ’ in reference‘ to the anti-gay
marriage argument, and “I ﬁnd it very hard "to believe that
homosexuality is a choice, any more than heterosexuality

has been a choice for me.” These statements set Miller up

as a moderate voice, preparing the reader to believe that he
is espousing reasonable, center-of-the—road positions. .

In fact, he goes on to make the argument that more
than 10 percent of Americans should be denied a basic
civil right, which is currently being upheld by an increas-
ing number of courts. This is not a centrist position, but an

extremely conservative one. An unsuspecting reader may
not be able to draw the distinction between a moderate

tone and a conservative message.

To be fair, liberal commentators occasionally use
these techniques as well. Unforttmately, they can’t seem to
use them as eﬁectively. The point is, whether a right-lean-
ing commentator is aware of his manipulative tactics or
believes his own ﬂawed rhetoric, as critically minded
readers, it’s important we be able to distinguish a bad idea
that sounds good fromga genuinely good idea. Being able
to pinpoint conservative rhetorical trickery is a good place
to start. -

Sabrina Spiher wishes liberals were better at manipulat-
ing the masses with good, albeit deceptive, rhetoric.

David Boreanaz is hot. Plus, four other reasons not to cancel “Angel”

What was the WB thinking? Less
than 10 years after the formation of the
network, it has managed to shatter every
cornerstone it was built on, antagonizing
its fans along the way. First was
“Roswell,” then “Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,” followed by “Dawson’s Creek.”
Now, the WB has announced it is cancel-
ing one of the last pieces of its foundation,
Joss Whedon’s “Angel.” ‘ *

In its ﬁfth season, “Angel” has bee
enjoying better-than-ever ratings. Some of
this ‘is because of its comical writing,
some because of the addition of former
“Buffy” star James Marsters — every-
one’s favorite platinum-haired vampire —
but most of all, it is because of the strength
of its fan base. .

This fan base has shown its support in
ways that are beyond belief.‘ One of the

main Web sites for the show, www.city—
ofangel.com, has posted several of the
sites fans can utilize to show their support
in light of the impending cancellation.

The two main sites, Saving Angel and
Renew Angel, have both been raising
funds separately to place advertisements
in many entertainment magazines, plead-
ing for the show’s renewal. Kristy

. Bratton, City of Angel senior writer,

‘ll:

encourages fans to speak out to save their
series.

I had a chance to chat with Kristy the
other day, and she told me some of the
best ways for fans to lobby.
“Sign petitions, donate distri-
butions to ads, focus your ”
energy to UPN and get every-
one you know to watch .
“Angel” for these last remain-
ing episodes,” she said. ' .

So, in support of one‘ of

my favorite television shows,
I want to give you the top ﬁve
reasons I think the WB, UPN,
TNT or FOX should renew
“Angel.”

1. “Angel” star, David
Boreanaz, is a reason to keep the show on
the air. Not only is he unbelievably gor-
geous, but he is also a talented actor and
director, proven this season with his direc-
torial debut of the “Angel” episode “Soul
Purpose.” The only movies Boreanaz has
done recently are the horror movie
“Valentine” and the newest installment of
the Crow movies. I need my David ﬁx!

2. “Angel” has one of the most gifted
writing staffs in television history. They

have taken a far-fetched idea, a vampire , lawyers. Notice a theme here‘? Seriously,

with a soul searching for redemption in_
Los Angeles, and turned it into a series
people actually care about. Through qual-
ity story arcs and genuine character devel-
opment, J oss Whedon, David
Greenawalt and the rest of
the writing staff have made a

5. I love this show! The characters
aren’t just characters, ﬂrey’re friends — I
know that sounds corny, but it’s honestly a

know that from 9 until 10 p.m., I can lose
myself in this wonderful universe full of

monsters, vampires and demons. As crazy I
as that might sound, it is actually a com-

fort.

“Buffy,” check out your ‘local listings. As
my mom always tells me, it’s constantly
on. While the premise might sound a little
strange, once you start watching, you’ll
ﬁnd a series unparalleled in the history of

television. Please, WB, don’t take it away.

Rock took the stage,rock won

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

The task had been set before
them, and each and every band had
fulfilled what was required to make
it to this final night. Four semifinal
nights produced four finalists, and a
month after the whole competition
started, the final product was right
for rocking.

The final competition brought a
great crowd to Mr. Small’s
Funhouse; with more than 500 peo-
ple in attendance, the bands were
all ready to rock. '

First to the stage was week-four
winner Legendary Hucklebucks,
who came out in their traditional
Blues Brothers-esque black suits,
white shirts and black ties.
The band started playing
once on stage, and the
lead singer took the
mic, introducing him-
self and his band
mates, and thanking
everyone for

music.

Their set

was filled

with energy
rightefrom the,
start, and their
musical abilities
were evident with
every song. They
played a swinging

rock that had an over-
abundance of energy.
The lead singer looked
very similar to the “King of
Rock ‘n’ Roll” in his later
years — a spitting image of
Elvis after he had .eaten one too
many fried peanut butter-and-
banana sandwiches.

. The front man played to the
audience, though, telling jokes
between songs and drinking, beer
while rubbing his gut, all while
reminding everyone to “Buy our
shit, ‘cause the beer is free.”

What they did that was interest-
ing and peculiar» happened during

their last song. The lead singer;

played a song that wasn’t their best,
but got the crowd into it, and they
ended on a high note.

Next to the stage was the rock
band Alisium. The youngest group
of the finals and winners of the first
semifinal night, Alisium came onto
an enthusiastic crowd chanting
them to the stage.

The lead singer came up wear-
ing sunglasses, which made him
look like he was trying to be cooler
than he is. Wearing sunglasses
inside should only be left to the
blind and the hung-over, but he
tried to make it work. It didn’t.

With a somewhat strong
rock sound —— they need
to make a few adjust-
ments here and there,
but mainly just
the small

 

details need fix-
ing — Alisium pro-
«vided the rock that
the band’s fans were
expecting. They
brought a few fans that
weren’t there for them into the
mood, but not many. That’s a big
factor in a competition like this.

A strong point for Alisium was
the band’s lead guitarist, who was
very impressive, moving in and out
of solo spots with a subtle touch of
rock star mentality. They had the
look and the sound, and were able
to make the crowd get a little rowdy
—- all ingredients in what could
make a strong showing in the local
music scene.

Mark Scheer and the Discount

two, came to the stage next, set to
try to keep rocking the pants off of
the crowd. Unfortunately, this week
proved to be a little stale for Mark
and his Stars, and the pants stayed
on for the majority of the large
crowd.

In their semifinal night, Scheer
and company had energy and
charisma that ‘topped that of the
other bands, but on this night,»

Their fans crowded close to
the stage, hooting and hol-

sang along to every

halfway through,
it lost its touch
and started
getting a little

if overdone.
Towards the
end of the set, the
front man showed off his
_yodeling talents, bringing the

crowd, who had started to drift‘

away from the stage, back up to, the
front. He took a risk, and that is a
very commendable thing to do,
especially in a rock challenge where
every song is being scrutinized by
so-called “rock experts.”

The Rockwells had the support
of the crowd and played the music
to make them dance and have a
good time, and were a surprising
end to the night‘. ‘

In what was a great night of
rock music, the final standings were

extremely close, the way it should

be, and coming out victorious was

Alisium. After all was said and

done, it was rock ‘n’ roll, straight-
forward without gimmicks and with
some well-written songs, that took
the coveted title and the bounty of
prizes that awaited. ‘

With a little more fine tuning,
and minor adjustments here and
there, Alisium could be the next big
thing that you hear being played on
the radio or headlining a sold-out
show. Whatever they do will be

Beautiful art from Victorian times at The Frick Art Museum

“Victorian Visions”

Museum artworks — whether in oil, pastel or
clay — often have a feeling of polished finality
and perfection that is stagger— ‘
ing. But rarely do artists cre-
ate their masterpieces in a
successive brain-to-ca~nvas-
to-museum process. It often.
takes numerous detailed stud-
ies to create the perfect
effects of color, line or form
that the artist desires in the
final piece. “Victorian

at The Frick Art Museum,
contains remarkable studies,

ished pieces on paper — in truthful representa-
media such as pencil, char- tion of objects and

(1828-1882), the figure of David is rendered
with beautiful modeling and naturalism in a

‘shockingly low number of pencil strokes. His

legs stand tensely, yet lightly, on the ground as
he swings his arm to fell Goliath.
That arm, however, appears twice in
the work — Rossetti first drew it
bent and raised above David’s head.‘
But then he changed his mind and
fixed it in the position of the down-
ward arc of his swing, creating a
stronger effect of line, without eras-
» ing the previous

. experiment. It’s
remarkable to see the
conception of both

" poses in the same
sketch. «

In a series of six pencil studies
of the female head, Poynter’s pencil ,
seems to have barely touched the page, yet he
has_ rendered remarkably modeled faces with
subtle expressive nuances of pose. Some of

Poynter’s works on exhibit '

are exactingly careful
preparatory studies; a few
even retain the artist’s- grid

a larger scale. In ,these

coal on a grainy, cream-col-

.The texture of the paper
allowed him to accurately
capture the feel of skin and
hair, though the ‘pensive
expression of his subject is
purely his vision. And
although it appears a fin-
ished work, there is evi-

a preliminary study for the

of the exhibition. His swirling application of

watercolor — and‘ some pencil — gives the

reclined malefigure vitality in its transparent
ability to depict every nuanced sinew of ﬂesh or
fold of drapery. The overall green-and—bl'ue
tonality of the work gives it.a unified feeling of_
early-morning light, and the diagonal of the
staircase in the background emphasizes the. lan-
guid pose of the’ model.

Also notable is “Tintern Abbey,”
yet detailed, charcoal and body-color study of
architecture by William Collingwood (1815-
1887). The cornerview of a Gothic abbeyplaces

-the viewer as -if standing a few yards from the
soaring facade of the building. Its impressive ‘

stained-glass windows and ivy-covered arches
are rendered with both "deep blacks and, stark
white highlights before fading off at the edges. It
feels spontaneous, yet inspired and thoughtful.

' However, this exhibit has much more to offer
than these few works. There are 66 drawings and

watercolors in all, including works by such)

artists as Albert Goodwin, Walter Crane,
Frederic Leighton and William Morris, the
leader of the British arts-and-crafts movement.
If you have any palate for works on paper, or the
raw beginnings of the artistic process, this
exhibit is a must-see. There is a conversation to
be had with the artists of these pieces through
their honest, basic studies that seem to reveal the

very roots of artisticvcreation.

going to get diving into this album.

This was my first full—length venture
with this band, and I wasn’t disap-
pointed. -

This band is a three piece, with a
male drummer and two very talented
ladies on cello, one being front
woman Melora Creager. The band is
in ,a time warp, donning clothing
from what looks to be ‘the
Renaissance Period. But the lyrics
are way ahead of that time, with
songs such as “Secret Message”
talking about scientific theories and
Nostradamus. “Two objects at
equidistance/acting as if they

squared.”
Each of the songs tells a story,
and that’s the general appeal of

Rasputina. The whole album feels A

like a gigantic storybook, and that’s

‘what draws the listener in to pay

attention to the vocals on each song.
You’ll hear a lot of rhyme
schemes, and, at first glance, the
lyrics may seem somewhat pseudo-
intellectual. But in reality, they’re
quite provocative. On the record,
you’ll find lots of vocal harmonies,
which are absolutely pretty. But
nothing can compare to the cello
work on this album; it’s just simply
amazing. If nothing on this album
rubs you the right Way, you still have
to appreciate the over-the-top string
work on this album. Most bands
would opt for bass and guitars, but
Rasputina makes the dual cello setup
work extremely well. ,
Rasputina is one of those bands
that are considered “goth,” which is
understandable, and you won’t see
them on MTV or VH1 anytime soon.
However, they make an industrial
sound that reaches a rocking
crescendo with the variety of styles
they present on this album. If you
don’t,believe me, pop on “High on

sound is even a bit reminiscent of

My Bloody Valentine, who under— music and destroying the concept

It’s unfortunate, but the music industry has turned
to desperate cries for attention in order to sell music.
The new music industry is something I am not proud
of. It used to take good music to sell records; now it
takes terribly pre-plarmed publicity stunts in order to
sell albums. - .

The queen of it all is Miss Britney Spears. I will
give it to the girl; she and her record company are
smart. She busted onto the music scene at the age of
16 in the video for “Hit Me Baby One More Time,’_’
but she wasn’t really trying to be sexy in that video.
She tied her shirt up like that to make it more “dance-
able,” right? Then she went on the cover of Rolling
Stone scantily clad and caused a buzz throughout the
whole country. And there you have it —-— millions of
records sold.

After she decided to take some time off in the
summer of 2003, she wanted to come back with a
bang. She wanted people to remember who she is, so
she ﬁgured: why not make out with Madonna? And
there you have ‘it —— millions of records sold.

Don’t get me wrong, Spears is a talented per-
former, but her career wouldn’t be where it is right
now if it wasn’t for her scandals.

Last year also introduced us to a new way to sell
records — reality shows. The nation tunes in every
week to see if Jessica Simpson could possibly say
something dumber then she did the night before, on
her hit show, “Newlyweds.” Then there is the other
half of the sickeningly happy couple, that Nick guy.
That show was the best career move that they could

“

THE PITENEWS

Enough is enough; let-The music sell itself

have made for themselves. Simpson’sv last album,
Irresistible, was considered a ﬂop, and Nick was try-
ing out the solo thing for the first time, since 98
Degrees ﬁzzled out. They both need as much publici-
ty aspossible and this was a career save for the both
of them. .~

Give it up for dumb blondes! It really is a shame,
because Simpson has a great voice, but now her
videos are advertisements for the show. Simpson is
even re-releasing her album with “Newlywed” bloopg
ers_ on it. I guess she decided that it wasn’t selling
enough, so she wanted to use the show to sell more
CDs_. Mission accomplished, Jessica.

Let’s save the best for last. Janet Jackson and the
famous Super Bowl ﬂash. She hasn’t released an
album in a really long time, and she plans to release
one on March 30. This ﬂash«“accidentally” happens,
and the next day her record company rush—released
her single. They say this was because it was leaked on
the Internet, but you can decide whatyou believe.

Good promotion is beneﬁcial foran artist. Good
promotion is getting the artist out there performing
live shows, and getting his or her music heard. But
record companies are- smart and they know what
works. All of these acts have recognizable talent, but
they aren’t being recognized for that anymore. If
they would stick to promoting the music and the tal-
ent of the artist, not their stupidity or their ability to T
have strategically placed piercings, these artists
could maintain their credibility.

you felt in the past. It brings you back to. those
times and makes you relive the pain, but there is
a beauty in that pain if you let them take you
there. _ g

“Almost Perfect” sounds upbeat musically,
but is riddled with tragic undertones. It is about a
man who loves a woman. This man is on the side
because thewoman has a boyfriend. He thinks she
is perfect despite her ﬂaws. He sings “she don’t
want to try, but this just feels so right,” showing
that he’s smitten. She seems to be withhim pure-
ly for the physicality of the relationship. Slie
knows how "he feels about her and gets her kicks
by teasing him. ‘

The ending of a relationship is evident in “On
My. Way.” -‘The song features lead singer Justin
Moore’s= strong and meaningful vocals and is
about getting revenge on somebody who broke
your heart. He wants to take away her sunshine
and her dreams. You can feel his vindictiveness
and pain when he sings, “Call and leave a cryin’
message; I wanna know it hurts like hell.” If you

have been scorned by a boyfriend, girlfriend or

even just a friend, it is easy to relate to his emo-
tions. .

NEW YORK — Facing the prospect
of losing for the third time in their
last four meetings with the Pitt
men’s basketball team, the
Connecticut Huskies handed the
ball to Ben Gordon. ’

A Gordon, the Big East
Tournament’s Most Valuable Player
and the game’s leading scorer with
23 points, scored nine points during
the final 4:30 of the tournament’s
championship game in then—No. 9-

ranked ‘ UConn’s ’ 61-58 victory

before ‘a sellout crowd at Madison
Square Garden on Saturday night. 5
“I think we made some mis-

takes,” Pitt guard Carl Krauser said. 9’

"I just credit the UConn team for
getting the loose balls and rebound-
ing the ball well down the stretch.”

With 6:26 left in the game,
Gordon and the Huskies (27-6 over-
all, 12-4 Big East) went on a run
that ensured they would not lose
their second Big East Tournament
Championship in a row to the
Panthers. UConn lost both meetings
with the Panthers last season,
including last _ year’s Big East
Tournament Championship game,

and split with the Panthers this -reg-. f A

ular season.

Then-No. 6-ranked Pitt (29—4, 9

13-3) was ahead 51-44'when Husky
forward Rashad Anderson nailed a
three-pointer to cut the Panthers’
lead to 51-47. On UConn’s next

' possession,‘ Pitt guard Julius Page

was able to strip Husky guard
Taliek Brown and race down the
court to throw down two points,
putting the Panthers ahead by six.

Gordon was fouled on the ensu-
ing possession and knocked down
two shots, from the charity stripe.
Panther center Chris Taft, Pitt’s
leading scorer with 11 points,
answered at the other end by hitting
both of his foul shots to make the
score 55-49. 9

Pitt’s lead remained at six until
UConn center Emeka Okafor made
a layup to cut the Panthers’ lead to
55-51. The Panthers were unable to

- score on their next possession, and

Gordon dealt Pitt a blow that it
appeared not to recoverfrom.

As the shot clock wound down,
Gordon attempted a jumper. Page
was able to block the attempted
shot, but deflected itlright back to

Krauser not
quite ready
to lead Pitt

 

‘NEW YORK —— Carl Krauser “just

wanted to get to the basket and try
to get the foul call,” he said after
the game about his last drive of the
Big East Championship on
Saturday. “We wanted to wind up as
a bonus; get to the line and make
free throws. That didn’t,happen.”

It certainly didn’t, and the
result was Pitt’s fourth — and
biggest — loss of the season.

Krauser’s play throughout the
championship game was similar to
his play during the whole series. He
ran the offense, drove hard to the
net and played aggressive defense.
But in the second half of Saturday’s
game, Krauser tried to be some-
thing he’s not ready to be — the
leader and the hero.

After leading Connecticut for
the better part of the game thanks to
an early 19-2 run, Pitt found itself
in a shootout with UConn with time
quickly running out. The pressure
was getting to the Panthers. Their
shooting percentage dropped off
dramatically from the first half, as
did their rebounds and steals.

With two minutes left, the score
was bouncing back and forth so
often that it was evident that Who-
ever made the last basket before the
buzzer would likely win the game.
And in a normal game, this gtypeeof
situation would favor the Panthers.
Hold the ball, run the clock down,
get it to the big-money shooters -

But this wasn't a normal situa-

NEW YORK — For the third consecu-
tive year, the Pitt men’s basketball
team had to wait to find out who its
first opponent would be in the quarter-

Many, including senior Jaron
Brown, had felt Pitt deserved a No.
2 seed and to play close to home.

— “It’s shocking to me,” Brown
said. “I thought we were going to
get a two seed, but we have to deal
with it. We aren’t worried about
seedings. We just have to play hard
because every team in this tourna-
ment is good.” ‘

4 Sophomore point guard Carl’
Krauser was also upset with the No.

3 seed. *

“We definitely thought we were
going to be higher than [a No. 3
seed],” Krauser said. “But that’s the
way the ball bounces, so now we
are going-to have to take it on the
chin and play.”

But in order to get to the second
round, Pitt must first win Friday
night against No. 14 seed, and
Atlantic A Sun Conference
Champions, Central Florida. The
Knights, who are 25-5 on the sea-
son, were surprised to see Pitt as a
No. 3 seed. I 5

“People are shocked that Pitt
wasn’t a No. 1 or No. 2 seed,”
Central Florida Future’s Sports
Editor Ashley Burns said. “I do
think they got screwed. Usually the
tournament committee protects the
top four seeds. I think it’s tough for
Pitt.”

Two years ago, Pitt was given a
distinct advantage in the NCAA
Tournament, when the Panthers
were placed as a No. 3 seed in
Pittsburgh’s own Mellon Arena for
the first two rounds. The Panthers
cruised to the Sweet 16 before
being upset by Kent State.

Last year, Pitt was again given
the closest site to home in Boston,
Mass., as a No. 2 seed, and again,
the Panthers cruised into the Sweet
16 before being upset by Marquette.

Even though the seeding and
location are not. where the Panthers
would “have liked, the team is pre-
pared for anything that comes its
way. Freshman center Chris Taft is
disappointed with the No. 3 seed,



 

-J.-A’ ..!.I\».Il.l..5..§ l'£..-I 3&3 LI. LINE 1

but he still believes Pitt is the best
team in the country.

“I think there is no one better
than us.” Taft said. “That’s just
what [the selection committee]
thinks. It doesn’t matter what they
think. It just matters how we go out
and play our game.”

“It’s going to be tough, but we
are ready for it,” ‘Taft said. “We
always playtough teams. We just
want to go out there and win.”

Friday’s game against Central
Florida begins 30 minutes after the
conclusion of the
Wisconsin/Richmond game, which

should be at approximately 9:50
p.m. If Pitt wins Friday, Sunday’s
game will. be at either 2:20 or 4:40.

Notes — While the NCAA
Tournament Committee may have
shown a lack of respect for Pitt, the
Panthers seemed to show a lack of
respect to the Big East Conference
by showing up 45 minutes late to
the conference’s awards banquet
last Tuesday in New York City.
But, when the Panthers did
arrive, Pitt received four of the
seven awards given out. Chris Taft
won the Freshman of the Year

Award after being named Big East
Rookie of the Week a Pitt-record
six times. Jaron Brown won the
Sportsmanship Award for his
actions on as well as off the court
over the past four seasons.

For the second time in three
years, Pitt took home the confer-
ence’s Coach of the Year and Most

Improved Player Award. Dixon, in .

his rookie season, won Coach of the
Year, and Carl Krauser won the
Most Improved Player. In 2001,
Ben Howland won Coach of the
Year, and Brandin Knight won Most
Improved Player.

Pitt to host EAGL Championships at the Pete

Gymnastics, page 1

D.C., on March 6. Pitt’s team score
of 193.675 placed them behind hosts
George Washington (l95.975) and
EAGL opponent Towson (194.675).

Falls on the balance beam — a
problem the Panthers seemed to have
put behind them in their school-
record performance against Penn
State —— returned, as three of the six
competing gymnasts fell, putting
scores of 9.2 and 9.175 in Pitt’s team
score.

Zeffiro won the individual title on
floor, scoring a 9.95, which beat out

four gymnasts with 9.9s, including
her senior teammate Erika Goldberg.
Other placing performances came
from sophomore Roslyn Singleton,
who tied for second on beam with a
9.85, and senior Diandra O’Connor,
whose 38.475 was fourth in the all-
around competition.

The Tuesday tri—meet that saw
Zeffiro’s perfect scores wasn’t as per-
fect for the team. Despite setting a
school—record score of 196.525, Pitt

fell to _a score of 197.4 posted by West 7

Virginia — a team the Panthers tied
with in January —— but did beat the
191.7 score of James Madison,

defeating the Dukes for the second
time this season.

Zeffiro’s~ 10s overshadowed the
accomplishments of her teammates
— Goldberg, who tied the old school
record of 9.95 on floor, and
O’Connor, who reached fifth all—time
on the Pitt scoring list with 1,268.575
career points.

Pitt then closed out its regular
season on Friday in College Park,
Md., where the Panthers scored 195.7
as ateam, placing them second
behind North Carolina State
(197.125), and ahead of host

Maryland (195.35) and visiting Air

A 9.95 on ﬂoor and a 9.9 on vault
increased Zeffiro’s school record to
16 scores of 9.9 or better for her
career.‘ O’Connor, now competing
regularly in the all-around after over-
coming a midseason illness, scored
38.5, placing her sixth in the meet and
moving her into fourth on the career
scoring list with 1,307.075 points.

Pitt concluded its regular season
with a 13-8-1 overall record and a 4-

Pitt 62, Boston College 53

The Panthers ‘finished up their
ACC farewell tour with their third
consecutive victory over the Eagles in
the Big East Tournament.

Krauser led Pitt with 18 points and
five assists, while Brown had 11
points and nine rebounds and Chris
Taft added 10 points and -eight
rebounds. Eagle Craig Smith led all
scorers with 20 points to go along with
12 rebounds. p

Pitt struggled through one of its
worst shooting halves of the season,
connecting on less than 30 percent of
its field goal attempts in the first half,
and Boston College went, into the
locker room with a 26-22 lead. 1

.After the break, Krauser helped
the Panthers get back into the game,
opening the half with a steal that led to
a basket by Troutman. A few plays
later, Krauser hit a jump shot to give
Pitt a 31-30 lead.

The Panthers would go up by as
many as six points with 6:39 remain-
ing, but could not get the Eagles to go
away. Boston College cut the lead to
two following a layup by Steve Hailey
with 2:39 remaining.

But again, Pitt was able to make
its foul shots down the stretch. The
Panthers converted six of eight free
throws to clinch the victory.

“I think our guys really stepped it
up in the second half,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said. “I thought our
patience in the second half was a big
key in getting better shots.”

Page threw up a desperation shot

Pitt began the game by falling
behind 13-2 in the first half. But it
used a 12-0 run to take its first lead
of the game. Brown, who had 10
points and seven steals, began the
run when he intercepted a pass “and
beat an UConn defender down the
floor for a bucket. Krauser was
fouled on Pitt’s next possession and
made both of his shots from the
charity stripe.

Panther center Toree Morris
slam-dunked ‘the ball off of an
assist from Brown to cut the
Huskies’ lead to 13-8. Krauser
hooked up with McCarroll for an
alley-oop on Pitt’s next possession
to bring it within three points.

Brown came up with another
steal and brought the Panthers with-
in one, and McCarroll gave Pitt its
first lead at 14-13 with a jumper.
Okafor put UConn back ahead by

used a spin move to hit a hook shot

ahead 16-15. Pitt outscored the
Huskies for the remainder of the
first half, 18-10, and led at half-
time, 34-25. '

Experience in NCAA Tournament can only help Pitt point guard

Ciampaglia, page 21

Krauser’s plan of driving hard and
drawing the foul therefore became a
tremendous miscue.

What resulted were shots being
blocked, open Panthers not touch-

"ing the ball and — as the entire

Panther nation witnessed — the
Huskies defeating the Panthers.
Krauseritook it upon himself at
the end of the game to try to win it
single—handedly. That isn’t Panthers
basketball. Everyone gets in on the
offense, the points get spread
around, the Panthers win. It’s a for-
mula that has served them well the

past few seasons and did them right
throughout the tournament — with
the exception of the final minutes
on Saturday. ‘

Sooner or later, Krauser will be
the unquestionable leader on Pitt’s
team.

After what will hopefully be a
long, successful run through the
NCAA Tournament, Krauser will
emerge with the experience and for-
titude to be a team leader and know
when the time’s right to be the hero
and when he should be dishing the
ball off to the hot hands on the
court.

On Saturday, however, Krauser

disrupted the Panthers’ formula of
total team play and tried to be
something he’s not ready to be.
Rather than looking for those fouls
and getting the free» throws, he
should have been aware of the envi-
ronment on the court.

_ Officials weren’t making calls,
and Panther players not used to
racking up the -points were getting
the job done. ,

Had Krauser the ability to lead
his team, he would have looked to
the guys making the shots and get-
ting the points rather than trying to
win the game by himself. He’s not
ready for that. a
