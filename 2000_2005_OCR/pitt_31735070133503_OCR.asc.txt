VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 87

Remembering D

GREG HELLER-LABELLEV V
Senior Staff Writer

Last night, speakers told students and members
of the community in David Lawrence Hall about Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., the reverend, civil rights
activist and revolutionary socialist.

, Paul Le Blanc, a member of Solidarity —‘‘a
socialist, feminist, anti—racist, anti-imperialist organi-
zation” — introduced the legacy of King as a. man
with “a radical and socialist vision.” -

“[The vision] involved a Marxist—inﬂuence
analysis,” Le Blanc said at the speech, which was
sponsored by Pitt’s Students in Solidarity, along with
numerous other activist organizations.

Le Blanc distributed an article that he had written ' ’
" to accompany his speech. In it, he said that King dis-

agreed with Marx’s hatred of religion but, as his
widow Coretta King put it, “knew that the basic prob-
lem in our society had to do with economic justice, or
the contrast between thehaves and the have-nots.”
Le Blanc also argued that King’s socialist ten-
dencies were not a result of radicalization, but that
his “basic” strategic orientation from the beginning
was far more radical” than simply ‘racial conﬂict.

. Sanjulo Ber of the Black Radical Congress
shared his stories of growing up in the years after
King’s assassination. -

“One thing I began to understand was that there
had to be some kind of struggle, some kind of effort,

and that it had to be waged in"a militant way,” Ber‘

Raisge ear since 1906

said. " ’ .
Ber spoke of  and Malcolm X as a “united front”
against racism. ‘ . '
p’ R “I began to understand how important leadership
is,” Ber said. “They were able to galvanize the mass-
es.” 0 »
Ber described his reaction to King’s paciﬁst
ideas, which he saw as too moderate for his message.

’ “I became a little. disenchanted with King,” Ber
said. “I believed in self-defense...If you hit me, I’m
gonna hit you back. If you smack me, this is the way
I was raised, ,_I’m, gonna break your face.”

As the crowd murmured, Ber told of the debate ’ A

between violent and non:-violent methods for the
movement, and the role that he saw leaders play.

“King was a- pragmatist,” Ber said of King’s’

pacifist tactics. “He saw the disadvantage we were at
in terms of weapons.” . _ -

The portrayal of King as a revolutionary contin-
ued as "the event went on. Speaker Mongezi‘Nkomo,

a member’ of Azapo — the Azanian Peoples .

Organization — dressed in traditional African garb
and making dramatic hand gestures, criticized the

~ state of the current society.

_ “We have a system where we glorify greed,” he
said. “We’ve been lied to at home, we’ve been lied to

-’at school, we’ve been lied to atour religious institu-,_ ‘

tions — if I,’m poor, it’s because I’m a sinner.”
’ As the audience calledout in agreement, Nkomo

Pitt laundry prices jumpio $1 then tumble again

Contracted provider could raise

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
‘ _ Staff Writer

When Matt Boehme learned that he
would have to pay more to do his laundry
at Pitt, he was disgusted.

“It’s ridiculous,” he exclaimed as he.

swiped his Pitt ID in a Pitt Funds slot next
to a bevy of washing machines in- the
Towerslaundry room.’ “Like, half .of the
dryers don’t even dry!”

- Boehme, a freshman who lives in

Tower B, was one of many students caught A
off guard by a sudden, unannounced price

increase in the. laundry room that took

place upon students’ retum from winter .
. break. Prices for bothwashers and dryers

in all Pitt laundry rooms had risen from 75

cents to $1 to operate each machine, bring-
ing the cost of doing a single load of laun-
dry to $2. , ~

Amy Wisniewski, a junior who lives
in Brackenridge and washes between three

and four loads of laundry every two weeks" I
saw her funds being rapidly depleted by’

the unannounced price increase.

“Sure it’s just 50 cents more per‘load‘,” '

Wisniewski said. “But when you add it
together you’re suddenly spending $6 to
$8 on laundry every time.”

On Tuesday, though, weary clothes
washers were met with good news: the
prices had been reduced, again without
notice, back to their original 75 cents.
Students who ‘foresaw even more desper-
ate quarter hoarding were elated.

“My roommate came bouncing into

0 my room yesterday with a big -smile,”
- VV1'sniew_ski said. “She was so happy [the 7

prices again beginning next year A

washers and dryers] were _ back to" 75

cents.” _

’ According to Pitt spokesman Robert
Hill, the laundry price ﬂux was the result of
Pitt’s contract with laundry service

’ provider Mac—Gray.‘Under the terms of the

contract, Hill said, Mac-Gray supplies the
washers and dryers, provides maintenance
for the machines, and sets the prices for

their use. The company is allowed to raise '
i the price of the machines one time to one
dollar. The ﬁve-year contract was signed in »

October 2000. e ,

“The housing oﬂice ‘ ’dn’t think it was
a good idea to ‘switch prices on students in
the middle of the year,” said Hill, explain-
ing why the prices were returned to 75
cents. “The oﬂice asked [Mac-Gray] to roll

the prices back. The company complied.” -

’ Hill said he doesn’t know if the laun-
dry company  raise the prices at the end

of the scur'ren,t’,-‘school year, but maintained
that, “they have that option.” ,

The Mac-Gray Company ‘ was
unavailable for comment at press time. s

Boehme said he wouldn’t mind the
price increase as long as he was able to see
visible improvements from the. additional
costs. ’

““I’d like better and more equipment.
It’s not too crowded tonight,” Boehme
said, sweeping his hand across the half
ﬁlled room, “but on weekends, this place is

packed. It doesn’t serve all the Towers’ res—_ _

idents Well.” , V
. Virrsniewski feels that ‘her residence

hall fees should cover laundry. “I don’t

have to pay to take‘ a shower. We pay
enough as it is withouthaving to spend
more onlaiundry.” - . A
“How do you know when the right
time is [to » raise’ prices]‘?” she asked.

.‘A‘We’re poor college students. There’s

never a good time to raise prices on any-
thing.” - ‘

Etched in skin: Illustrated students, inkers tell all

SUZANNE FORLANO
For The Pitt News

Kevin McCue sat in a zebra chair
with his thigh illuminated by an over-
sized desk lamp decorated with a skull
sticker. Beside him, Z Messner inked
and wiped his leg in a process that
seemed never-ending.

“It’s irritating as hell,” said
Messner, the owner of Z—Spot at 115
Meyran Ave., about the pain of tattoo-
ing as she traced the line of a Celtic
heart on McCue’s thigh.

“It’s hard because I don’t want any-
thing I’ll regret,” said McCue, a Pitt
sophomore_. _

In addition to the heart, McCue has
a shamrock on his hip, also inked by

Messner. McCue said his Irish heritage ,

was his main reason for choosing his
tattoos. He said that he enjoys being
Irish and is proud of it.

But pride is just one of the reasons
people get tattoos. The designs are a
longstanding tradition in many cul-
tures. Before the tattoo gun pricked ink
into skin, sharp bone needles were used
to slowly pierce, the skin of Paleolithic
men. Tattoos originated 12,000 years
ago and have crept their way into
almost every culture around the world.

According to Messner, the zebra
motif of Z—Spot attracts many people.

THE PITT NEWS

She also said that because of its loca-
tion in a college community, Z—Spot
caters mostly to students, and that most
are from Pitt.

Senior Crystal Merchant went to Z-
Spot for the redscorpion tattooed on
her back. “I didn’t want to get
something that -I have seen on other
people,” she said, “and I was deﬁnitely

not going to get a ﬂower or some-

thing.” ‘~

Merchant disagrees that getting a
tattoo is merely an irritating procedure.

“I was squeezing the chair and my
friend’s hand hard,” she said. “I could
feel it right on my bone. It was really
uncomfortable.” '

She said the pain prevented her
from getting another tattoo.

Some cultures use tattoos to indi-
cate social and marital status, or as a
sign of criminal action or membership

~ to a clan or society. But it wasn’t until

the late 1960s that tattoos began to
show up on large numbers of people.

It took centuries for them to gain
acceptance.

Explorers re-introduced tattoos to
the west in 1691 after journeys to the
South Seas, but it was not until the late
1700s'that tattooing reached the aris-
tocracy of England. Then it became
fashionable to get tattooed in discreet
places. "

Pitt student Erin'Lambert grimaces while receiving a tattoo on her right hip at

Lefty’s Tattoo Parlor in Oakland.

Tattooing, though, did not gain
popularity because of the painstaking
process. Original1y,- ink was applied
through individual punctures in the
skin. In 1891 the electric tattoo
machine was invented. This led to
widespread tattooing, but also became
a stigma for those in circuses and freak

shows.

Like McCue, senior Christine
Penkala also takes pride in her Irish
ethnicity. A black inked claddagh is tat-
tooed on the small I of her- back. The

Love of tattoos changes
with history, culture

Tattoos, page 2

between two hands, represents friend-
ship, love and loyalty and is-typically
seen in jewelry such as rings.

Traditionally, a claddagh is sup-
posed to be given by ‘someone who
feels friendship, love and loyalty for
another. Though Penkala has . a
boyfriend, she bought the tattoo her-
self. She decided on the design, she
said, because she never wants to forget
the importance of being true to herself.

Penkala went to Lefty’s Tattoo
Parlor at 115 Oakland Ave. when it was
previously known as Inka Dinka Doo
for this tattoo.

Erin“ Lambert and Zeb Cranmer
now "own Lefty’s but have worked
there since the days of Inka Dinka Doo.

Cranmer says that the popularity of
tattoos can never be pinpointed.

“They go through phases,” he said.

’ “One week tribal art will be what most

people want and the next week
Japanese characters will be -in.”
During World War I and II, tattoos

became popular among sailors in the
Navy — the men would get tattoos of

‘places they had traveled to. After

WWII, though, the air of tattoos
became sour.

In 'l96l an outbreak of hepatitis
heightened many people’s already neg-
ative views of tattooing. This led to
government health-codes for all tattoo
shops. By the end of the decade univer-

sal procedures for cleaning the tools .

werein effect. a
Tattooing of celebrities changed

the public attitude to one of accep-

tance. With the rise of this ancient art

form came a wave of artists who -

widened the spectrum for designs.

Both Messner and'.Cranmer agree
on the differences of tattoos between
men and women. Men7s tattoos usually
span many genres, they said while
women tend to get smaller, more femi-
nine designs such as ﬂowers, hearts
and butterﬂies."

And though men usually get larger
tattoos, Cranmer said, “Women take it
better!” A— p , -

Speaker identifies way s
to crusade   against racism

King, page 1

related his views to those of King.
“King was challenging the basic
immorality of the principles ,of the
founding of the United States,” Nkomo
said. “Our country is based on lies.
Every ‘democracy’ and, .‘free society’ is
based on 1ies.” '

Joining the local activists was J.
Quinn Brisben, a presidential candi-
date for the Socialist party. in 1992.

“Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a
socialist,” Brisben said. “He said on
numerous occasions that his notion of
justice could be achieved only under
some type of democratic socialism.”_

Brisben, a member of the civil
rights movement in the 1960s, "related
the story of King’s nomination to lead
the famous Alabama bus boycott,
which he described as being “in the
right place at the right time.”-~~ .

E.D. Nixon, leader of the Alabama
NAACP, had already had one boyco

j fail. 1

King, a young reverend at the time,
was chosen to lead the second one
because of his status as a neutral, out-
side party in the community.

“[The night of the decision], Nixon

seconded King’s nomination, and King 7

rose to speak. In later years I more than

once heard Nixon summarize the

moment by saying ‘we picked a num-
ber out of a hat and got Moses,”’
Brisben said. I '
The evening ended with a discus-
sion session led by emcee Ramin
Skibba, chairperson of Students in
Solidarity’s environmental committee.
. “You don’t have to go to events to
ﬁght racism,” Skibba told the audi-
ence. “Sometimes [racism] "is in the
way .a"‘contract is made or wages are
enforced.”

. The speakers all agreed‘ that King’s

radical crusade needed to be continued,
in small and large actions.
“We, have unfinished business,”
Nkomo said.
 When an audience member com-

plained that she “needed more” in ”

order to understand her .own racism
and asked what to do, Brisben was
quick to respond. ‘

“You can’t help that you are part of
a racist society,” he said. “Don’t waste
time feeling, guilty. I Do something
about it.” - -

ERIC SLATER
Los Angeles Times

BAGRAM, Afghanistan’ — Just
minutes into the workday, the Explosive
Ordnance Disposal team ran into its ﬁrst
perilous dilemma: The Afghan villagers
wanted to keep their rocket. I

_ The 122 mm, Soviet-made white,
tube of high‘ explosives was lying half

inside the perimeter of the base here that
U.S. forces control along with anti-
Taliban ﬁghters, and half in one of the
numerous villages around the ﬁeld. A
dozen children were crowded around,

poking it. A village elder said he wanted

to keep it.

“We’ll take it if they want, but it’s
their rocket,” Army Sgt. Mike Barker
said with a shrug. “It’s dangerous for
everybody, on the base and in the vil-
lage, but we can’t take their rocket just
because we think it’s a good idea.”

The local Northern Alliance com-
mander, Khawani, soon appeared, over-
ruled the elder and asked the Americans
to dispose of the rocket. After deciding
that it was safe because it didn’t have a
detonator, Barker and two of his coun-
terparts loaded the rocket into their
Humvee and headed down the road.

Two minutes later, they spotted an
unﬁred air-to-air missile lying in the
dirt.

For the soldiers of the Explosive
Ordnance Disposal, or EOD, team here,
it was just another day, another artillery
shell, another cluster bomb, some mis-
siles, some mines and the rocket.

The American team is just one of
several such units in Afghanistan, units
from coalition countries that are trying
to make the country a bit safer even as
they continue ﬁghting Taliban and al
Qaeda forces.

Disposing of such hazards falls to a
unique group of soldiers, every one of
whom applied for the job and studied

hard, in a ﬁeld with a more than 50 per—‘

cent failure rate, to get it. In the U.S. and
many other nations’ militaries, soldiers
cannot be assigned to an ordnance dis-
posal unit.

The dangers they face can be
extreme: Whereas most rnineﬁelds in
this ravaged country are marked, there
are no ﬂags pointing out other ‘deadly
detritus of war.

National Update
Bomb squad tordiir

Ordnance Disposal team finds
and disposes of live bombs  

This 744th EOD unit from Fort

- Meade, Md., is not a demining team.

Under U.S. military code, de-mining is
left to nongovernmental organizations
such as the HALO Trust, which is work-
ing throughout the county.

The EOD unit handles mines only if
they are in the team’s immediate way.
Its job here is to gather everything that
could explode, wrap the munitions in
other explosives and blow the whole
mess up.

As Afghans, U.S. soldiers, interna-
tional peacekeepers and aid workers
begin moving into abandoned battle-
grounds — some deserted for a decade,
others for a few days as the ﬁghting con-
tinues — ordnance teams are being
employed as never before.

British experts are rushing to clear
ﬁve sites in the capital, Kabul, before
4,500 peacekeepers attached to the
International Security Assistance Force
arrive by the end of the month. French
and Jordanian troops are helping clear
areas around the northern city of Mazar-
e-Sharif.

“This stuff is everywhere, absolute-
ly everywhere,” Sgt. 1st Class Robert

Breaux said. “Many of the mineﬁelds ‘
are marked with wire. This stuff isn’t ~

marked.”

After more than two decades of war,
Afghanistan is so littered with high
explosives that about ﬁve Afghans die
or are maimed each day, according to
the International Committee of the Red
Cross. V

As the conquering armies have laid
mines, then ﬂed, with their conquerors
then laying their own, ‘the mineﬁelds
have become ubiquitous. _

But unexploded ordnance —— rock-
ets, anti-aircraft and recoilless riﬂe
rounds, and bombs made by the former
Soviet Union, U.S., China and Germany

—— poses a unique threat as people begin '

to move about again.

The ﬁxed ﬁring positions of yester-
day’s ﬁghters can be located, but no one
knows where the rounds they launched
landed. The same is true with air-deliv-
ered ordnance, which can miss its target
by miles. Thousands upon thousands of
munitions were left during retreats,
advances and ﬂanking maneuvers.
Munitions stockpiles were rocketed,

Bagram, about 20 miles north of Kabul,
has been a battleﬁeld almost since it was
built in 1976. Between 1999 and the end
of 2001, the ﬁeld changed hands several
times.

Enter the main gate at Bagram, look
to your right, and there’s a Soviet rocket
pointing right at you. No one has
retrieved it yet because 10 yards in one
direction is an antitank mine, 10 yards in

another is an anti-personnel mine, with
several anti-aircraft shells scattered
around and likely dozens of other
devices tucked beneath the earth and
hidden in the dry grass.

Look to the left and you’ll see a hole
in a concrete guard shack. That’s where
the EOD types pulled out a recoilless
riﬂe round, essentially an armor-pierc-
ing rocket-propelled grenade minus the
rocket engine.

The best way to destroy any muni-
tion is" to blow it up in place. Most of the
time here, though, that’s not possible.

Some in the village where they

Celebrate the NFL playoffs  y

So, what are all of yinz doin’ this
weekend?

If you’re doing anything like many in
the ‘Burgh are, yinz are gathering around a
tube somewhere Sunday afternoon and
watching the Stillers.

That’s right, the Stillers are playing the
Baltimore Ravens in an AFC divisional
playoﬂ’ game at Heinz Field. And in case
you haven’t noticed, Pittsburgh is a foot-
ball town. ~

People here go wild. At almost every
game, you’ll see highlights of fans with
faces —- and guts — painted black and
gold dancing around in 30-degree weather.

The past three years of not making the
playoffs have been tough on this city's
morale. Chances are, many Pitt students
were not here the last time the Stillers
made the playoffs.

Thankfully, football fever is back in
Pittsburgh again. The Stillers have home-
ﬁeld advantage throughoutthe AFC play-
offs.

So now is a time to party. Throw that
kielbasi on the grill — OK, so many of us
have dorm rooms or apartments, but trust
us, George Foreman grills work just as
well — have a few friends over and, for
those over 21 of course, get a case of beer.
Or seven. Perhaps yinz want to go for the

complete ‘Burgh feel and get the Ahrn'

City Beer, but there’s other stuff out there
too.

Besides, this is a three-day weekend.
So yinz have extra time to still get your

work and studyin’ and all ‘at done.

The playoffs this year have a special
signiﬁcance for Pennsylvania as well.
Saturday, the other team across the state,
the . Philadelphia Iggles, will play da
Chicago Bears at Soldier Field. We hear
many 0’ yinz are from Philadelphia and
places dahn ‘ere. So yinz should party
Saturday too. And while we’re at it, the rest
of us will too. It’ll be an all-weekend party.

‘ And just think 4 if both the Stillers
and Iggles succeed this weekend and next,
the Super Bowl will feature the two
Pennsylvania teams for the ﬁrst time.
ESPN’s Chris Berman, also known as
“The Swami,” predicted this would hap-
pen. Let’s hope this prediction is better
than many of his oﬂiers this football season
it’ at

Imagine all of the fun Pennsylvania -
and the Pitt campus — could have with
this. Yinz from both Philly and Pittsburgh
could have a war in the week leading up to
the game. This may obliterate some places
on the Tumpike, such as Harrisburg. But
would having a new capital be so bad 11’
at?

So this weekend, it’s time to get ﬁred
up. Yinz need to walk around town talking
like Pitt News alumnus Myron Cope.
Stock up on Stillers and Iggles merchan-
dise. ‘

And most importantly, build up your
hatred of da Bears and the Ravens. After
all, yinz only know Baltimore for crabs
and Edgar Allan Poe.

What’s the difference between i  

coca and cocaine?

When I was shopping for souvenirs
at the marketplace of La Cancha in
Cochabarnba, Bolivia, this summer, I
bought my younger brother a T—shirt
that said, “La hoja de coca no es droga”
—- “The coca leaf is not a drug.”
Unfortunately, policymakers. in
Washington and La Paz, as

Andes as I did.

But the reason I didn’t have prob-
lems was the coca leaf.

Since even before the Incas ruled
an empire that stretched from Colombia
to Chile, natives in this area chewed
coca leaves and brewed a tea from
them, which not only gives

well as the media and the
general public, seem to be
ignorant to that fact and the
social turmoil this igno-
rance has caused. , o
‘Coca leaves are most
known in North America
as the base product of
cocaine. This is true.

A suppressant and source of
extra energy. In fact,

I ed this leaf as a way to get
more work out of their
indigenous slaves.

In Bolivia, coca is easy
to buy. In the small town of
Quillacollo, I walked by

Andes is the manufacture

of cocaine. ‘

, But this is not the case in South
America. Bolivia is_ a‘ mountainous
country — for example, Cochabarnba is
located at roughly 8,500 feet above sea
level, and La Paz is the highest capital
in the world at over 12,000 feet.
Travelers from lower elevations, and
even natives, face difficulties in dealing
with the thinness of the air. A friend of
mine who traveled to Cuzco, Peru — a
city located at 14,000 feet — was ill the

entire time she was there. Last year, the '

Brazilian national soccer .team ﬂew to
La Paz nearthe start time of its game
there and left almost immediately after
to avoid the effects of the elevation.

But while on my trip to Bolivia, I ,

thankfully only experienced slight alti-
tude sickness. Perhaps someone who
lives in a city with a low elevation
should never try playing soccer in the

many old Quechua women

‘selling the whole leaf, which people

today still chew. And even in an
upscale, American-looking supermar-
ket in the big city of Cochabamba, you
can buy bags of coca tea. , ‘

It’s everywhere, and an essential

part of the lifestyle in that country. 1 .
After every meal at our hostel in the

town of Vinto, we’d drink coca tea. Our
in-country guide, Jean Carla, gave me a
green pill made from coca leaves when
I felt sick to my stomach one day. While ‘
I felt rather horrid the next few hours, it
accomplished its desired"'effect: clean-
ing out my digestive tract. Iwas healthy
enough to get back to normal the next ‘
day. I '

information on drug war

McKenzie, page 8

‘history of tropical commodities class

with the late Michael Jimenez, most
drug foods — such as coffee, tea and
cocoa —-—‘ that come from the tropics
require a great deal of reﬁning before
they become the products we see on our
grocery store shelves.

Cocaine — of course, not a product
you often see — is no different.’The ﬁn-
ished product takes a great ‘deal of
reﬁning, and it takes a large number of
leaves to make a small amount of
cocaine. ,

But yet, the coca leaf is illegal in
the United States. The Lonely Planet
travel guide, for example, speciﬁcally
said that bringing coca tea back into the
United States was a bad idea. 0

This leaf controls our foreign poli-
cy‘ toward the Andean countries of
Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.
A report on “60 Minutes” Sunday night
detailed the destructive effects of our
eradication program in Colombia.

The campaign includes dropping

herbicides from the air onto the plants,‘
, herbicides that then get into the water

and kill other vegetation — plus quite
possibly cause medical problems for
locals. . '
In Bolivia, former President Hugo
Banzer —- who resigned last August
because of health problems and is under
indictment in Argentina for his collabo-
ration in disappearances with other

South American dictators when he was _

the unelected ruler of Bolivia in the
1970s —— began the so-called ‘.‘Dignity
Plan,” with the goal to wipe out the
country’s illegal coca crops by the end

‘of his term.

Several sources indicate production
of coca has dropped by 90 percent, and
VOA News reports that the,U.S. State
Department considers Bolivia “a
model” for coca eradication._ But the
methods used in the eradication -
namely military force — leave_much to
be desired. Bolivia is currently in tur-
moil as a result. ' ~

. But in the North Atlantic, we pri- _

marily hear of the eradication in Bolivia

A as a SUCCCSS.

Most importantly, we almost never
hear of "the domestic uses of the coca
leaf.‘Rather, we simply‘ associate it with
cocaine. For example, an article in The
Financial Times (news.ft.com) speaks
of “illegal” coca crops. But it never
mentions domestic uses of coca and
only praises the drug war in Bolivia.

VOA News, meanwhile, says that‘

the government is allowing 5,000
hectares of coca for domestic use — but
that is it.

With the new war on terrorism, the

’ war on drugs has seemingly taken a

back seat —— for now. But it may heat up
again in the future as the connections
between the drug trade and terrorism in
different countries become clearer. So
it’s time for us to educate ourselves on
the drug war now, before our leaders try
telling us that we need to send troops to
South America as well. ’

Just remember: Coca
cocaine. '

Gymnastics win opening meet

COURTESY OF Prrr ATHLETICS

Pitt’s Raya’Mullin placed first on the uneven parallel bars, with a score of 9.650.
Mullin also placed fourth in the balance beam competition-

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

In their first meet of the season, the
Pitt gymnasts saved their best for last. -

Through three rotations at Trees
Hall, Pitt was ahead‘ of the University of
Rhode Island by a score of 140.225 to
137.375 —— not too large a margin.

But it proved to be more than
enough, since five .Panthers scored
career highs on the floor exercise and’

p the team won 188.100 to 185.025.

Having the victory come at the
expense of the Rams was especially
sweet, since the Rams grabbed the sixth
and ﬁnal spot in the NCAA Northeast
Region last year away from Pitt.

“This was a really good win for us,”

I head coach Debbie Yohman said. “We

had to win this meet.”

Among those five with a personal
best on the ﬂoor was Marcy Blitz, who
had career highs in each of the three
events she participated in.

“This meet was deﬁnitely a person-

‘ al best meet for me,” said Blitz, whose

score of 9.575 on the. uneven parallel
bars was second only to teammate Raya
Mullin’s 9.650. A

“I felt really conﬁdent, especially
on the vault.’’ —

Blitz scored a 9.600 on the vault,

‘tying for fourth. She ﬁnished up with a

9.475 on the ﬂoor. _

The other career highs on the ﬂoor
included Diandra O’Connor’s 9.775,
which was the highest score on any
event during the meet. Teammate
Heather Launse placed second on the
ﬂoor with a 9.700. Lisa Yarosh was
third with her best of 9.600, and Alyse
Zefﬁro rounded out the career highs
with a 9.325..

Launse and O’Connor were the ﬁrst
Panthers in over a year to compete in
every event in a meet. They were the
only all-arounders at the meet and
Launse edged out O’Connor by a score
of 37.750 to 37.650.

Injuries to starters Jamie Briner and
Jennifer Easter forced the Panthers to
use all—arounders, but Yohman is hop-
ing to get more gymnasts in every event
in a meet this year.

“I expect to be able to rotate them
in and out,” Yohman said. ,

The balance beam was an_ especial-
ly troubling event for both teams with
only two competitors not being penal-
ized for falls. O’Connor was one of
those two and she tied with the Rams’

Gymnastics, page 14

If someone gave you a new house without any

financial obligations, would you complain? Of
V course not!

But, with the Petersen Events
Center opening, some people feel the '
need to whine.

“There aren’t
seatS.” » ~ ,-

“It’S taking too long’ to be fin-
ished.” . ' A '
“‘It’s just for the basketball teams. ”

-These_ bafﬂing thoughts came
about after Athletic—Director Steve

Pederson gave a tour to the media last simian}-3 vmw

week of the new building: .
For one, the students will have
1,500 seats. Or, a possible 500 extra

section remained unfilled. And after a terrific start‘

to this season, it wasn’t until last -Saturday’s game
against Notre Dame that the Field
House’s student section was clogged.
Pathetic. ' A »
, You want wild fans? Go watch
Duke and its Cameron Crazies. They
actually stand the entire "game, the
entire year, any opponent. Dedication.
Pederson was correct with the 150
percent increase in student -seating.
Instead of offering too many and hav-
ing a dismal-looking section, he made
sure it will always look somewhat
% crowded.‘ That way, when the basket-
ball teams are playing well, tickets will

empty seats compared to the dilapidat-

' ed Fitzgerald Field ‘House.

But, why would they be vacant? The reason is
simple: Pitt students have not always been wild
about their basketball.

1 Even after last year’s Big East tournament run
and after advancing to the second round of the

p be coveted. Intelligent.

Keep in mind that student seating wil1.be the
best seats available. They will be lower than the
rest of the seats while ringing the court.'That way,
students will have no excuse not to stand during
game. Every seat will have a chair-back, so when

the students do sit, and assuredly they will, they

‘ ~‘‘.‘-‘'. ~ ~.:—.-\‘

will be more comfortable than sitting on broken
wooden planks. . .

The new digs are taking awhile to finish.
Ralph Willard, former Panther coach if you “ded—
icated fans” did not know, told guard Brandin
Knight that the place would be completed by his
junior year. So, things are a little behind schedule.

But, that is better than hurrying up the
process. Pederson and Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg should be applauded for traversing
the country comparing all the new arenas. Once
finished,—the University will have something more
than an old, gothic skyscraper to beproud of.. It
will have a glass palace.

Look at Miller“Park in Milwaukee. It was hur-
ried, and that led to construction mishaps through-
out the year. ,

People are wrong saying that the Convocation
Center is just built for basketball. Advanced recre-
ation facilities, a food court, a computer lab and
the Panther Hall'_of Fame are just a few of its
amenities. Graduation will also be held in it.

ACC battle to be a great game, not a greatpick

Well, the football season is over
and after watching my roommates
lose money on _the Penguins last
night, I figured it was time to chime
in with a new edition of the
Compulsive Corner.

Friends don’t let friends bet on
hockey.

When last I left you, I had made
five bowl picks, three of which I
made good on, leaving my record in
picking football spreads at 33-21-1,
for the season. Let’s hope that I can
do as well on the courts.

Here’s a look at five games that
are on tonight’s slate, including the
Maryland/Duke scrum, a Big East
game and my pick of the night.

No. 3 Maryland at No. 1 Duke (-9.5)

This has been the most highly
anticipated game of the season and I
see no reason, other than the line, to
believe that this will not be a great
game.

Maryland has defeated the Dukies
at Cameron Indoor on two consecu-
tive occasions, a feat that is tough
enough to accomplish once.

The Terrapins (13-2, 3-0 in con-
ference) are led by 6—foot-3-inch Juan
Dixon. Dixon, one of the most talent-
ed guards in the nation, is averaging
19.3 points per game. After opening

Duke (14-1, 3-1), as always, is
extremely talented as the future top
pick in the NBA draft, Jason
Williams, is averaging 21 points per
game. Williams and future NBA

Dunleavy can put up big numbers at
any time. V

‘ Although this is another dominant
Duke team, it is not invincible, as
several teams such as Kentucky and
Florida State, who beat Duke, have
kept within striking distance for
entire games; -

If Maryland can stay close with
Duke in the first half, which I think

they can, then the game should go.

down to the wire.
The key player in this one is

Lonny Baxter. If he can keep Duke_

from getting second chances off of
the glass and if he can’ score his 15

winner of its third straight appearance
at Cameron.

I still like Duke, but not to cover.

Relay teams on  

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

-Over the past two weeks, the Pitt
indoor track team has been testing its
mettle. Runners have been doubling,
tripling, even quadrupling up on events,
just to see how much they can take.

And with 13 ﬁrst place ﬁnishes
over two meets, the added workload
didn’t appear to slow them down too
much.

Terrapin Invitational ’

The Panthers headed to College
Park, Md., for the Terp Invitational, an
unfamiliar meet for the team, just after
the New Year. That unfamiliarity, cou-
pled with some terrible weather, may
have had a negative effect on the team,
head coach Steve Lewis said.

“Basically, the team was ﬂat.”

They may have been ﬂat, but dam-
age was still done on the rest of the
competition.

Beth Rocks won the 800 meters
with a time_of 2 minutes, 13.36 seconds
shortly after helping the distance med-
ley to victory. V

“I felt rusty, but we did a lot of
work at that meet,” said Rocks, who ran
the first 1,200-meter leg of the relay
that also included Elizabeth Bayne,
Janine Jones and Amanda Schmidt.

_ Jones placed fourth in the 800 with
a time of 2:16.88.

The men were just as successful in
the distance medley. Jesse Chalfant,
Marcus Walker, Andrew Zang and Jeryl
Wilbom took home first (10:21 .39).

Thrower Patrick Harding has been
hampered by knee injuries in recent
weeks, but a throw of 16.04 meters won
him the meet in Maryland.

“Quite frankly, I wasn’t happy with
it,” said Harding of his performance,
shooting for consecutive Big East
indoor titles in the event. “I’m tired of
throwing 55 feet.”

Happy or not,:Harding is still the
leader among Big East throwers in the
shot this season. -

pointfor Pitt track

Other high ﬁnishes for Pitt includ-
ed Anthony Pelham’s third place in the
400 (49.75), Tamara McGill’s third in
the high jump (1.57 m) and the team of
Kim Lyles, Mera Belisle, Bayne and
Trenace Elliot, which took third in the
mile relay (3:48.58).

Black Squirrel Invitational

The Panthers traveled to Kent,
Ohio for the second time this season
over the weekend, this time for the
Black Squirrel Invitational, held on the
Kent State campus. _

“Familiar territory,” Lewis said.

Lewis also said his team had some
extra incentive for this meet after the
average performance the week before.

The Panthers made themselves at
home and dominated the meet winning
eight events.  _

The relay success carried over from
Maryland as Maureen McCandless,

' Nicole Van, Deanna Cole and Lauren

Shaffer won the distance medley with a
time of 12:18.97. /, _

Lyles, Bayne, Jones and Elliot blew
away the field in the mile relay
(3:47.60). Anthony Fulton, Chalfant,
Walker and Wilbom won the.men’s race
(3217.85). ’

Lyles also won the 200 in 24.78 and
took fourth in the 60-meter. dash with
7.76. Belisle won the 400 in 57.09 and
third in the 200 in 25.43.

Bayne won the 500 in 1:13.70, with
Elliot and Jones taking third and fourth,
respectively. Rocks came in a close
fifth and it was her ﬁrst time ever run-
ning the event.

Wilbom won the 800 in 1:51.93
with Chalfant close behind in second.

Maurice Patterson got a pair of
close seconds in the 200 and 400.
Harding threw for 16.78 In, which
placed him in second.

Now that the Panthers have shown
how much they can endure, Lewis is
putting the focus back on all out speed,
and his runners will participate in their
specialties this weekend at the Pepsi
Invitational at Virginia Tech.

tough for opposing teams to get on

Tommy Smith (11.9 points per game)

Arizona State has won five of its
last six games, with four coming at
home. Tough losses on the road
include a 13-point loss at Oregon and
a 12-point loss at BYU.

There’s not one thing that I really
love about this game, but the line is
screaming to take the Bruins. UCLA

this year in the Pac-10, home court,
so I’m taking the Bruins. ’

Stanford at home by 20 points and
comes off of an impressive 61-53 win
at Oregon State. More importantly,
the Bears are big in the middle.

Arnit Tamin both average in double

Pick of the Week j
Delaware at Pennsylvania (-9.5) -
Penn, who’s always a force in the
Ivy League, has made some noise this
season. The Quakers ( 10-4, 1-1) have
beaten Big 5 rivals Villanova and
Temple and have come close to upset-
ting St. Joseph’s and Illinois. ,
Ugonna Onyekwe leads Penn
with 18.3 points per game and one of
my favorite players, Koko
Archibong, is putting up 16.3 per

‘game.

Delaware (7-8, 3-3) is ﬂatout
horrible. The Blue Hens were crushed
by 27 points by the same St. Joe’s
team that Penn almost upset.
Delaware h-as lost by double-digits at
Bowling Green, North ' Carolina-
Greensboro, George Mason and of
course, Virginia Commonwealth. 4 '

The Hens have just one player
averaging double figures, with guard
Mike Ames dropping in a whopping
10.3 a game. The ,team’s leading

rebounderi is" 6-foot-3-inch guard

Ryan Iversen. Not good.

Give me a big win for coach Fran

Simply having the surrounding green

Students might not think the
2,000 club seats, four court side lux-

Pitt teams do well, Pederson will be
able to retain the coaching staff.
That is‘ something Pitt Stadium or
the Field House has never done. ,
All in all, the Convocation

' Monday’s

NCAA convention to discuss altering
coursework and GPA requirements

2 CHRIS WILSON
Cavalier Daily, University of Virginia

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. —
Division A I representatives at
National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s annual con-
vention will discuss the possibility of
changing academic requirements for
student-athletes. '

Currently the NCAA dictates that
to remain eligible to play Division I
athletics, student-athletes musthave
completed 25 percent of their total
coursework after two years in college
and an additional 25 percent each
year after that. '

The new proposal would require
students maintain a 1.8 GPA by the
beginning of their second -years.
Each year thereafter, they must com-
plete at least 20 percent of their
coursework and maintain the mini-
mum GPA their universities require
to graduate.

- David B. Knight, the faculty rep-
resentative to the NCAA from
University of North Carolina-

— Greensboro, is one of the proposal’s

main supporters.

“Under the old rules, a student
could be in minimum compliance
[with the eligibility rules], maximize
his or her years of eligibility "and not
be able to graduate,” Knight said.

Under the proposed system, “if
you maximize your eligibility, the
minimum requirements have to allow

_ you to. graduate,” he said. I

The proposed change is‘ based on

Boston College
St. J ohn’s

a several-year study of student-ath-
letes that Knight claims allows
NCAA administrators to predict bet-
ter whether athletes will graduate-

.“We have this database that fol-
lows the student-athletes and pre-
dicts [whether or not they will gradu-
ate] based on college work rather
than high school work,” Knightysaid.

According to Jane Jankowski, a
member of the NCAA public rela-
tions staff, about 58 percent of stu-
dent-athletes in, Division I schools
eventually graduate -—— a figure that
has remained fairly consistent in
recent years. ’

Richard McGuire, director of
athletic department academic affairs
at the University, opposes the imple-
mentation of a minimum GPA
requirement for student-athletes after
their firstyears.

“I think that cumulative GPA’

requirements after the third and

.fourth year make a lot of sense,”
.McGuire said. “The first year is a

time of adjustment.”

Additional-ly, “students often
take some classes pass/fail, which
means that their actual GPA is based
on a small number of classes,” he
said. 3 C
I In addition to college require-
ments for ‘eligibility, students also
must meet certain standards in high
school to be eligible to play. .

Currently, in order to .be eligible
for Division I sports their first year,
athletes must maintain an absolute
minimum 2.0 GPA in 13 core classes

in high school. They also must have a
certain minimum SAT score, which is
lower for students with higher GPAs.
For example, a student with a 2.5

GPA needs an SAT sgore of 820 to be-

eligible, while a student with the
minimum 2.0 needs a score of 1010.

The proposal, which proponents
hope to solidify by April, recom-
mends raising the course requirement
but perhaps doing away with the
minimum‘ SAT ‘score. The possible
new standards also are aimed at pre-
venting eligibility requirements from
being racially biased against minori-
ty groups. . -

“Use of test scores has been an
issue in the larger academic commu-
nity for many years,” said Diane
Dickman, a staff liaison for the
NCAA cabinet of Division I academ-
ic eligibility. “The biggest emphasis
here is to decrease the disparate
impact [of the academic require-
ments] on minority and low-income
students.’-’ _

- The NCAA was sued in a class-
action suit in 2000 by several high
school students who did not have the
minimum SAT score to play Division
I athletics and felt this restriction
was biased against minority groups
who historically score lower on'stan-
dardized tests. -

“There are two approaches here,”
Dickman said. “We could either

eliminate the SAT requirement or
_lower the cut score. Either way,
we’re trying to increase our accuracy
in predicting who will graduate.”

between 35 and 45? If so, you may be eligible for a research
study. Researchers at UPMC Health System are examining the
brain effects of nicotine related to“the age of the participant.
Testing includes a medical evaluation, smoking history,
subjective tests for current smokers, and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Participants must weigh between 120 and
180 pounds, not have metal in their bodies and be willing to
abstain from nicotine and caffeine 12 hours prior to patch
administration. Participants will be compensated up to $230
for about 15 hours of their time. This is not a smoking
