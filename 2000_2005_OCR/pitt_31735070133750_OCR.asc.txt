Held in the Public Health building’s auditorium,
the event was set up in a Jeopardy-like format.
Contestants chose questions from six topics: black his-

(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. —
Pennsylvania State University men’s track and
field athlete Kevin Dare, whom friends described
as fun and outgoing, died Saturday afternoon in a
pole-vaulting accident at the Big Ten
Championships at the University of Minnesota-’s
Fieldhouse.

Dare, a sophomore from State College,_ Pa.,
fell backward while attempting a 15-foot, 7-inch
vault and struck. his head on the eight-inch metal
box used to plant the pole. He was taken to the
Hennepin County’ Medical Center and was pro- «
nounced dead shortly after his arrival. Dare was
19.

Dare is the eighth University Park student to
die since May and the second student-athlete to die
in the last two weeks. Michael Carter, ‘a member of
the Penn State golf team, was killed in acar crash
Feb. 13. -

Out of respect, the Penn State team withdrew
from the four remaining events Saturday, and .
Sunday’s meet was canceled after a meeting

among Big Ten coaches‘.

V‘-‘We lost a friend, we lost a teammate, an ath-
lete and a young -life,” Penn State track and field
coach Harry Groves said. “The best way to honor
him is to go on living.” »

Last spring Dare won the USA Junior
Championship in pole vault, and in October he fin-
ished fifth in the Pan American Junior
Championships in Argentina. His personal best
was 16 feet, 4 and three-quarter inches.

“He was one of the few guys that could have.

had a shot at track beyond college,” said Matt
Moyer, a javelin thrower and one of Dare’s room-
mates. - .

While he was an accomplished athlete, Dare
was better known as a regular guy who included
everyone in-whatever he was doing and pulled the

' team together. Teammate Brian Stumpf said Dare

always went out of his way to make ‘others feel
comfortable and a part of the team.

“He was a great friend of mine and everyone
on the team,” Stumpf said. “There wasn’t a bad
thing you could say about-him. It’s a real shame
this ever had to happen.” - «

Dare’s track coach at State College Area High

\

Penn state track athlete dies in pole vault accident  

School, Bob Baumbach, said Dare’s caring person-
ality extended beyond his teammates. Baumbach’s
son, Brandon, was diagnosed with leukemia in
1999, and Baumbach described how Dare and his
brother, Eric, who is also a member of the Penn
State track and football teams, would visit
Brandon and go out of theirway to be supportive.

“He was one of the most personable individu-
als you would ever want to know,” Baumbach
said. -
"Despite his fun-loving attitude, Dare’s com-
petitive drive shone through when his cleats were
on. He would thrust himself fully into challenges,
determined to succeed.

«This season he challenged himself to finish in
the top 10in the nation at his event and become an
All—A-merican. ’

Not only did he push himself but he also
encouraged others to do the best they could.
Moyer, who called Dare one of his first friends at
college, said his presence was always felt and he
always brought the best out of everyone.

“He was one of those guys that always had a
smile on his face,” Moyer said. “And he could
always put a smile on my face.”

Internet, others offer alternative springbreak options

LAUREN BAN
Staff Writer

It’s that time of year again.
Whether they’ll be lounging on the

‘ beach, gambling in Las Vegas, shop-

ping in New York or just relaxing at
home, many Pitt students are search-
ing for a deal’ before they make their
plans.

With hundreds of ways to spend
this break, thearray of options —
and scams — can be overwhelmin
for some. 1 r

The Internet is the fastest option
for those in search of deals and the
widest variety of choices, as well as
the best tips on ways to avoid spring
break hell. .

From cheap vacation options to
tips on how “to keep from getting
busted,” the Internet features plenty
of ideas on ways to plan a trip to the
beach, a road trip or,an alternative
spring break trip.

One popular Web site is
Orbitz.com, which says it offers the
“best values for spring breakers” to
places such as Virginia Beach,
Miami and the Vail Valley. This site

offers special low airfares, as well as
inexpensive hotel rates, car rentals,
package deals and cruises. The site
also boasts that it’s a “great way for
students to find a last minute deal.”
Another Web site,
Realcollegelife.com, offers “Spring
Break FAQs,” which include helpful
information for those embarking on
vacations, such as, “What are some
good safety tips?” or “How do I keep
from getting busted?”
Springbreaktravel.com offers a

spring break newsletter that discuss-

es the many problems that can occur
when booking a spring break trip.
These horror stories range from
problems with overbooking to meal
plans. The bottom line of this site is
to be sure to ask detailed questions of
the travel company beforebooking
anything. 5

Looking for some snowy fun? A
ski trip may be your best option.
Tellurideskiresort.com is offering a
sale on college season passes and
cards, claiming that “spring break is
the ideal time for students to hit the
slopes.”

Travel agencies are another

option for booking the perfect vaca-
tion. For this option, Pitt, students
need look no further than 118
Meyran St., where Council Travel is
located. While most of their vaca-
tions are already sold out, there are
still a few options left for those
spring break slackers.-

“Everything is extremely sold
out this year, Pitt’s spring break is a
very popular week. If you’re still
looking for options, we might’ still be
able to put together a last minute
package deal for you. Of course, it
may be more expensive,” said
Council Travel employee Lindsay
Adelsheim. '

Aside from the normal beach
vacation, there are many Web sites
offering alternative spring break"
options. These sites offer choices in
volunteering for causes from every-
thing to AIDS/HIV to children’s

- issues and homelessness. The goal of

an alternative spring break is to
expose students to complex social or
cultural issues and, according to

. www.stanford.edu/ group/ASB/ about.

htm, “to transform students into
advocates,of social change on issues

affecting our communities.

Pitt’s Student Volunteer Outreach
offers options for an alternative
spring break experience as well. This
alternative break program helps
engage students in community ser-
vice projects and experiential leam-
ing during their spring break. This
year, there are nine programs, in
areas as diverse as New York and
Florida, each dealing with its own
particular social issue. If interested,
contact Jean Park, coordinator of the
alternative spring break program, at
(412) 648-1480.

Some head to the beach, others to
the slopes or a volunteer activity, but
some students are looking forwardpto

a week of simple times at home.

Junior Rachel Felver is one of the '

many students spending her break at
home. .

“I’ll be going home, just relaxing
and seeing my friends,” Felver said.

Graduate student Jennifer Smith
will spend her spring break concen-
trating on schoolwork.

“I’ll just be working on papers,”
Smith said. “I’ll probably be in the
library a lot.”

Heart transplants, brain

Cells and Enron’s 40l(k)s

Studies Show Signs of Brain Cells’
Recovery

BOSTON ——New studies of brain
cells, growth and the impact of environ-
ment suggest it’s possible to enhance the
brain’s capacity—meaning the number of
nerve cells in the brain — by simple activ-
ities such as running, scientists report.

Such results seen in rodents suggest
that progress is being made toward over-

WASHINGTON — Homeland secu-

the country needs a “trusted ﬂiers” pro-

that the system of random airport checks
fails to target genuine terrorist threats.

His suggestion of a trusted ﬂiers pro-

speed them through the tighter require-
ments imposed in the aftennath of the

Restrictions on information must
be balanced carefully

Since Sept. 11, it’s come to feel like a
fair trade: less freedom for an increase in
national security. We’ve willingly waited”

through longer lines resulting in tighter secu— ,

rity at the airport and sporting events. Olﬁce
buildings have an increased police presence
and we’re asked to prove our identities more
than ever before.

For the same reason, the Bush adminis-in

tration wants to block our access to data -
a move academics, lawmakers and civil lib-
ertarians, according to the Feb 24 edition of

T the Washington Post, are calling an unprece-

dented eﬂort to limit dissemination of infor-
mation. . .
When George Mason University librar-
ian Joy Suh received aletter ﬁom the gov-
ernment telling her to destroy data on the
national water supply, Suh willingly com-
plied. According to the Post, about 300 insti-
tutions were asked to destroy the document
which contained information the govern-
ment believes could be used to aid a chemi-
cal or biological attack Many of the institu-
tions may have done so without even con-
sidering the ramiﬁcations. " ,
And it seems the Bush administration
may have overlooked the implications of
asking librarians, whose function in our soci-
ety is to aid in the dissemination of public’
information, to destroy data necessary to
legitimate research.
Anumber of concerns arise as a result of
policies which restrict the ﬁee ﬂow of itrfor—

mation to the public. Right now, such poli— -

cies are not yet fomialized, but Congress has
30 bills pending in an attempt to redeﬁne
what the government -must do to release
information under the federal Freedom of
Information Act. VVithin the next few weeks
the government plans to release guidelines
regarding what information should be with-
held.

Free ﬂow of information is essential to

. democracy. The idea is a fimdamental prin-

ciple within the Constitution; it is the logic
behind freedoms of speech and press. The
government shouldn’t take any steps to
restrict the ﬂow of information lightly.

Rather than working retroactively and
asking librarians to aid in the destruction of
data necessary to legitimate research, the
government must formalize its policies
regarding the suppression of information. If
national water supply data is to be kept from
the public at large, then the govemment must
classify the information, not rely upon uni-
versity librariaiis to police the availability of
documents.

The government is looking down a slip-
pery slope. Before it sends out its next batch
of destruction orders, it must careﬁilly bal-
ance national security issues with the ﬂee
ﬂow of information and the legitimate
research restrictions would thwart. Only at
that time can the government issue a codi-
ﬁed set of guidelines for information to be
classiﬁed or withheld.

Volunteering in pajamas

I liked the idea of volunteering in my
pajamas — what could be easier? It never
occuned to me that while.volunteering from
my dorm I wouldn’t be able to engage in my
favorite pajarna-wearing activity — sleep.

My ﬁrst trip to the downtown Red
Cross chapter came last October in the patri-
otic, post-Sept. 11th ﬂurry. Like

The next Monday, I was pumped for
another night of dedicated non—service. I sat
in my night class, quite pleased with myself
for my magnariiniity of spirit.

The pager vibrated.

Gulp.

The light ﬂashed mockingly. I sqiiirmed
for several minutes before

many of my friends, I felt oblig-
ed to take action, but only by
comrrritting as little of myself as
possible. I browsed over the
volunteering brochures with the
enthusiasm of a thirteen—year-
old buying school supplies.
Naturally, the “volunteer in
your pajamas” slogan of the
Armed Forces Emergency

sighing and slinking out of
class.

After ﬁfteen minutes of
scratching out notes froma
woman who wanted her son
to return from the anny, I
wondered if it was too late to
remove my name from the
duty list for the rest of the
month. I felt ﬂustered, con-

Columnist
Service volunteers grabbed my fused and way out of my-
attention and after two short ses- league.
sions, I was certiﬁed and ready to roH. And the damn pager vibrated again.

My role as an AFES volunteer sounded
simple. When the family of someone in the
military has an emergency, such as a death or
serious illness, and the family, needs its ser-
vice person to come home, they call the Red
Cross arrsweiing machine. The machine
pages me with the farnily’s number, and I
call back the family as quickly as I can. Itake
the message and pass on the request to mili-
tary oﬂicials. All this is done in a shift firm
5 pm to 8 am, when the Red Cross oﬂice
is closed, supposedly from the comfort of
my own dorm '

But it didn’t really sinkin tliatlniightbe
too tired to volunteer then, too. ’

On my ﬁrst night of service, my beeper
never went off. I’m awkward with new gad-
gets, so after a few hours I began to question
whether I had even turned it on. I ﬂicked a
switch and it beeped. Flicked another and it
vibrated. I even used a cell phone in an
attempt to page myself, somehow managing
to ring my dorm phone, set oﬂ the pager and
reach my voice mail in a single call. Though
I was frighteningly accessible, nobody

called

By morning I was no longer disappoint-
ed I had gotten off easy. Not only could I
volunteer in my pajamas, I could volunteer
without actually doing anything.

Twelve sleepless hours later, I was not
feeling particularly noble. After four calls
and ﬁve hours on the phone with some guy
named. Demris out in Oklahoma, I was no
longer blinded by the appeal of volunteering
in my pajamas. When I called my supervisor
to turn in my report, it took all my self-con-
trol not to resign.

My next night on duty is coming up in
a few days, and I can’t pretend to be
enthused I haven’t experienced a great rev-
elation about saving small children or mak-

ing the world a better place by sacriﬁcing my

night of sleep. ,
Since coming to college I’ve regarded
volunteering ﬂippantly, as though I am
already so big for sacriﬁcing a bit of my time
that I don’t really need to be reliable. I still
back out of things without feeling much
guilt. ._
I guess it’s time I actually stuck some-
thing out. Like it or not, I’m now an after-
hours volunteer, and I’m determined to stay
with it for the rest of the semester. I just hope
that my Monday night class grade can sur
vive it. »

Excuses for
failing your
midterms

  

Sports Vrzw

Kenneth Paul

There are only two times a year that I
stress: midterrns and ﬁnals.

Considering that I bought my textbook
yesterday for a test that I have tomorrow, I
have ‘some heavy—duty cramming to do.
The good news is that my book only cost
me $107. Thanks, Nordy, for looking out
and not letting us students get raped every
time we enter the bookstore.

Cramming is an art.

_It’s a pastime that is great, yet nerve-
racking. A good crarmner acknowledges
his procrastinating ways, but attaches a
piece of rationalization to each wasted
minute. _

Most students probably begin to study
for a mid-term about a week early, though
they probably have been reading along
throughout the term as well. But what every
teacher needs to realize is that the Olympics
were last week, which made studying diﬂi-
cult.

For every student that envisions getting
really bad grades this week, clip this col-
umn out and show it to your teacher. I’ve
already spoken to the deans of each school

and they assured me that I’m a dumbass_

and that this won’t work but don’t take their
words for it. Just be persistent You have to
be consistent and unshakable with your
excuses.

Excuse No. 1 begins with the U.S.
hockey team. Going the patriotic route with
your excuses is a great starting place.
Classes had to be missed last Monday. The
U.S. opened its run on the ice, with an 8-1
whooping of Belarus. The 1 p.m. start was
precluded by a woman’s curling bashing of
Norway. Don’t laugh; Curling was one of
the coolest parts of the whole ordeal.

For my female readers, there was ﬁg-
ure skating too, on Monday night Note that
if any male readers watched the ﬁgure skat-

Panthers can clinch division

Brandin Knight goes back home to New Jersey tonight as he

Press poll.

and the Panthers look to clinch the Big East West division.

JOE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

The year was 1988. Communism was still hanging around and
Brandin Knight was knocking down threes with his ﬁrst grade bud-
dies in East Orange, NJ.

' That year also marked the last time Pitt was ranked among the
nation’s top 10 teams.

Fast forward to 2002. The Panthers (234 Overall, 11-3 Big East)
are back among the country’s elite teams, holding down the No. 8
spot in the ESPN/U SA Today poll and are No. 10 in the Associated

While the Communist Party doesn’t appear to be making a
comeback, Brandin Knight heads home tonight to try to help the
Panthers win their sixth game in a row and sweep Seton Hall for the
second consecutive year. i

In the teams’ ﬁrst meeting on Feb. 7, Knight scored a garne—high
19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to help hold off the Pirates last-
minute run for a 70-65 win. '

Knight ignited the Fitzgerald Field House crowd with four con- .,
secutive threes to start the second half on the way to Pitt’s 20th win
of the season, the ﬁrst time since the 1990-1991 season that the
Panthers have won that many games. » .

Julius Page made his presence felt, scoring 18 points and grab-
bing seven rebounds. Page got the home crowd ﬁred up early by
slamming home an alley-oop from Knight in the ﬁrst half.

Pitt wrestlers giveEdinboro a fight

JASON BARRANTI.
Staff Writer

The 2001-2002 regular season came to
an intense close Friday night for the No. 21
Panther wrestling team. Pitt took its
matchup with No. 15 Edinboro (10-3, 5-1
EWL) down to the wire, just falling short of
an upset, 24-15. .

Edinboro brought ﬁve nationally
ranked wrestlers to the Fitzgerald Field
House, and locked up in a battle for Eastern
Wrestling League supremacy.

The evening began with a top-ranked
matchup between Pitt’s No. 15-ranked Carl
Fronhofer and No. 13-ranked Matt King of
Edinboro. The 165-pound bout started with
a ﬁrst period takedown by King. Fronhofer
was unable to gain a lead, and eventually
lost the decision 6-1.

The 174-pound match featured Pitt’s
Matt Catullo and Edinboro’s Vinnie Courts.
Courts ﬁlled in for No. 2-ranked Josh
Koscheck, who didn’t wrestle because of
illness. Catullo scrapped for a three-point
decision, and tied the meet at three apiece.

But the Panthers slipped into a seven-
point hole by losing the next two matches.

Matt Camino scored a major decision
over Rob Black in the 184-pound match.
Camino is one of the few unranked

wrestlers from Edinboro, and he wrestled
extremely well. He dominated Black, tak-
ing a 4-0 lead. Catullo punished him
throughout the match and won 11-2.

The 197-pound bout followed, with
No. 19-ranked David Sandberg losing in
sudden-death overtime to No. 8—ranked
David Shunamon by three points. The low-
scoring match went back and forth through-
out regulation with the score knotted at one
going into the ﬁrst overtime. VV1th only a
few seconds remaining in the second over-
time, Shunarnon scored two points on a
reverse and took the match.

Down but not out, heavyweight Jacob
Lininger made a statement in the ﬁfth
match of the evening. Edinboro’s Josh
Pearce scored two points on a takedown but
was quickly reversed and then pinned by
Lininger at one minute and 41 seconds in
the ﬁrst period. Lininger’s 12th pin of sea-
son improved his record to 31.-9 on the year.

After a short intermission, Pitt once
again fell behind.

James Thornton suffered a technical
fall against No. 20 Shawn Bunch in the
125-pound match. Bunch was too much for

Thornton, and took the match by a score of ’

19-3.
No. 15-ranked Cory Ace followed by
pinning Pitt’s Shawn Arnistade at 2:03 in

the ﬁrst period. Ace’s win in the 133-pound
match gave Edinboro a commanding 12-
point lead. '

Pitt would not go quietly.

Blaise Mucci squared off against No.
1'3-ranked Chad Caros in the 141-pound
contest. In the upsetof the night, Mucci
dominated Caros, and then capitalized on
his mistakes. Mucci got the pin on Caros at
2:54 in the ﬁrst period. His strong effort
brought the crowd to its feet, and put Pitt to
within six, with two matches remaining.

Justin Giovinco made things even I

closer when he scored a three-point victory

over lVIichael Ashby in the 149—pound bout. ‘'

Giovinc0’s win brought Pitt within three. '
The ﬁnal match of the evening paired
Pitt’s Zach Doll against Ryan'Yates. The

. 157 -pound Doll was very aggressive, but
was outdone by Yates who stalled the entire

match. After scoring two takedown points

in the ﬁnal period, Yates came out victori- ,

ous. Adding’ riding time‘ throughout the
match, Yates was awarded a major deci-
sion. .

The Panthers ﬁnish up their season
with a 12-6 overall record, and a 4-3 record
in the EWL.

Pitt will hit the mats next at the EWL
Championships on Mar. 9-10 at Lock
Haven.

Gymnasts edged by narrow margin at Illinois

After Pitt’s Feb. 16 meet with Central
Michigan and Ursinus College, Pitt
women’s gymnastics head coach Debbie
Yohman discussed fatigue as a possible issue
with her team.

If it was, you wouldn’t have known it
last weekend.

The Panther gynmasts recorded their
12th best score in team history.
Unfortrmately, it wasn’t enough as the
Fighting Illini posted their highest score of
the season and defeated the Panthers 194.00
to 193.50.

The Panthers began their evening on the

piled a score of 46.65 for the event, nearly
two points lower than Illinois’ 48.60.

The Panthers moved on to the vault

Pitt ﬁnished its evening on the balance

improved in recent weeks. That trend con-

mg, I ask that you do not read this colurrm
any fruther or any future column.

Studying was tough on Tuesday
because I’m sure most of you were at the
women’s basketball game against Rutgers.
OK, I know none of you were there, but I’m
trying to help you out here, so just go along
with me.

Wednesday, the U.S. beat up on the
German hockey team. That, along with

' karaoke and $3 pitchers of Yuengling at

lV[itche1l’s kept me away from Hillman.

And of course, Thursday night our No. 8- _

ranked basketball team dismantled Rutgers.

No teacher would expect a student to
stay in on a Thursday night to study, while
the basketball team is playing and there are
booties to be shaken with at Peter’s Pub,
The Attic and Pub I.G. 'Ihat’s just not the
Pitt spirit

Cracking the books was out of the
question on Friday night because the U.S.
hockey team was at it again, taking down
the Russians. Nobody should really have to
study on Saturdays, especially when there
are all kinds of parties on the hill, plus

~ ample opportunity to relax and prepare for

Sunday’s gold medal match between
Canada and the U.S. ,
Even when the Canadians had beaten

the U.S. there still wasn’t really time for '

studying because like most Pitt students,

I’m a huge Matt Kenseth fan and I had to i

watch the conclusion to the Subway 400 in
Rockingham, N.C.
Many business students, like myself,

' have a busy week ahead of them. And for

all of you marketing majors, the easiest

excuse still remains. I know there had -to . 

have been tons of students that were brain-

~ washed by Nike’s 15-minute commercial,‘

thus forcing you to go to the mall and buy
those $200 Air Jordans‘. ’ -

If there’s one person out therethat buys I '

those hideous shoes, congratulations. You
are the biggest corporate whore of all time.

Finally, spring break is less than a week ,

away. After a wild 2001 break in
Amsterdam, I’m looking forwardto the

beaches of Panama City. I know plenty of .

you will be in Cancun, Jamaica and South

Beach and I know that no matter how well -
. or how poorly you’ve done this week,
spring break is the ultimate in rationaliza- V

or amnesia, whichever wayyou 

tion 
look at it.

Either way, drink somewhat responsi-
bly, try not to cause too much static and

always rap up. See ya after break, when

we’ll all be engulfed in March Madness.
