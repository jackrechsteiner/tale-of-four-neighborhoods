ny Sign up aainst PATRIOT Act

Wn.L SCHEFF _
Staff Writer '

In February, New York City joined a
growing number of cities that have passed

resolutions against portions of the USA‘

PATRIOT Act, fueling the controversy

surrounding the anti-terror legislation and

spurring continued debate. _

“Overall, it’s clear that the PATRIOT
Act went too far, and did not regard the
values that deﬁne our society,’.’ said New
York City councilman Alan Gerson,
whose district includes the site where the
World Trade Center stood. _ Gerson said
that much of the act is useful and needed,
but that key sections subvert basic free-
doms without improving security.

New York City’s Resolution 60 “calls

on the government-to not hold any New ~
Yorkers without due process . . . it .oppos- '

es the secret detention of persons or deten-

tion without access to a lawyer,’.’ accord- .

ing to Udi Ofer, project director of the
New York Bill of Rights Defense
Campaign, a project of the New York
Civil Liberties Union. “New York City
joined over 250 other communities which
have responded to the PATRIOT Act by
creating civil liberties safe zones that
include over 43,000,000’peop1e,” he said.

“The Justice Department is being

‘very misleading to the American public on

this issue,” Ofer continued. “The PATRI-

~ OT Act changed privacy rights and broad-

ly deﬁnes domestic terrorism, so that it
could include things I don’t think the
American public would classify as terror-
ism.”

But Justice Department ofﬁcials
maintain that the bill does not threaten
civil liberties, while enhancing law
enforcement’s ability to thwart terrorist

“It’s very important that the facts get
out,” said "Mark Corallo, director of the

Oﬂice of Public Aﬂairs at the Justice

- Department. “This law is the single most

important tool we have to prevent future

terror attac .” '
Corallo characterized the intentions

of critics of the act as “well-meaning, for

“many, but I think some have a political

agenda Not only is it false that we’ve
been misleading, we’ve had to spend con-
siderable time and resources correcting
the statements of people against the
PMRIOT Act. We know and are conﬁ-

- dent in the law.”

“Flowers for Algernon” grow in Allegheny libraries

‘NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

Monday night was an unfortunate night for
Daniel Keyes, a native of Florida, to be in
Pittsburgh. Flurries danced in the air and the tem-
perature fell into the 20s. Luckily, Keyes had
warm memories of the Steel City to keep him
cozy.

In 1960, Keyes traveled to Pittsburgh to attend
the 18th Annual Science Fiction Convention.
There, he was presented his first Hugo Award for
his short story, “Flowers for Algernon,” which
described a mentally disabled man whose brain-
power is boosted by a surgical procedure.

A Hugo is to a science fiction writer what a
Grammy is to a musician, and Isaac Asimov, who
presented the award to Keyes, was to science fic-
tion what John Lennon or Eric Clapton is to
music.

Asimov, greatly impressed with “Flowers for
Algernon,” asked Keyes how he did it.

“If you ever figure out how I did it,” replied
Keyes, who was unknown before he wrote the
story, “tell me, so I can do it again.”

At Carnegie Library, Keyes spoke about the
origins and implications of his story, which he
adapted into a 1966 novel that earned him another
Hugo.

Keyes, a former schoolteacher, said that the
story was inspired by society’s treatment of slow
learners and the competitive nature’ of American
primary schools.

“I think we ought to have a class early in

childhood development called ‘Empathy 101,”’
Keyes said. “If you can look at your neighbor and
tell what that person is feeling, you get an A.”

Keyes’ speech concluded the Allegheny
County Library Association’s second annual “One
Book, One Community” program, in which the
library urges Pittsburghers to read and discuss a
single book.

“This year, we set the theme to be mental
health issues,” said Carri Czyzewski, membership
coordinator for the ACLA. “‘FlOwers for
Algernon’ captured what we wanted to discuss
about human intelligence and development, and
what society places on these things.”

Czyzewski said that 4,000 editions of the
novel had been added to the 46 libraries associat-
ed with the ACLA and are being checked out
quickly. .

Last year, when the libraries stocked upon
“To Kill a Mockingbird,” by Harper Lee, the title
was checked out more than 50 times as often as
usual. 0 _

Dozens of participants packed into Carnegie
Library’s lecture hall for one treat-last year’s read-
ers did not receive: hearing the author speak.

Keyes told ‘the audience that children he
taught in a special education class inspired the
novel’s protagonist, Charlie Gordon.

One child told him, “Mr. Keyes, I want to be
smarter,” but he was bored and frustrated in the
special ed class. Keyes then realized thatmany of
the children he taught honestly wanted to be
smarter. o _

Another boy revealed to Keyes that he was

completely illiterate. Keyes taught him to read
using the phonics system, in which a child learns
to read by sounding out words. The boy “just
soared.” ~

But the student missed class for three weeks 0

because of family problems, and when he
returned, he could no longer read. I a

“In a‘sense, I fused those two boys intoithe
character of Charlie, through the magic of fic-
tion,” Keyes said. Like the first boy, Charlie hon-
estly wanted to be smarter and, like the second,
his brainpower soared and then plummeted.

Keyes also spoke about a recent experiment in
which scientists genetically engineered a smarter
rat similar to Algernon, the lab ‘rat on which the
procedure Charlie undergoes was tested.

Keyes, who had‘ just finished his memoir,
“Charlie, Algernon and Me,” contacted the head
scientist and asked howlong it would take, now
that scientists had produced an Algernon, before
they had a Charlie _GOrdon.

The scientist predictedit would take about 30
years. . .

“You writers come up with the ideas,”.he told

Keyes. “We just fOllOw”

Keyes did not comment on whether or not
such an experiment would be ethical. ‘

Keyes concluded his speech by returning ‘to.

that night in Pittsburgh more than 40 years ago,
when Asimov handed him the Hugo award.

“That night, [I imagined that] a second hand
grabbed that Hugo award,” Keyes recalled. “It
was the kid who walked up tome and said ‘Mr.
Keyes, I want to be smarter.”’

Students pass Go, but stay put  

for marathon Pittopoly game

BRENDA MILLER
Staff Writer

Bars were railroads, the cornputer lab -

was jail and the Cathedral of Learning
was Boardwalk once again this yearin the
E—Week event Pittopoly. .

The six—foot-by-six—foot Pitt campus
version of the popular game was» covered
with local favorites such as Peter’s Pub,
the Wﬂliam Pitt Union and a favorite
among commuters — “Free Parking”
(because of a broken meter).

The engineering departments divided
into seven teams, which included one
freshman squad. .

Participants subbed in and out durin
the event that ran from 11 am. to 6 p.m.,
while others chose to stick it out for the
duration of the game.

A crowd came and went with stu-
dents standing on chairs from Benedum
Ha]l’s lobby to see the board and their
team’s progress.

VV1th this year’s theme of E—Week
being video games, each team used a
homemade game piece, which was a
character or item from a video game.

At 3:30 p.m. the chemical engineers
were first out with their Contra piece, but
the industrials were not far behind as their
Pac-Man was set to rest a half hour later.

William McClendon, a chemical
engineering major, stood in the center as
banker and referee for ﬁve of the seven
hours. He admitted that things were hec-
tic at ﬁrst, but once the rules were agreed
upon and understood the game ran
smoothly.

With 10 minutes remaining, the
board was lined with 2-inch, red, wooden
hotels as the bioengineers and the
mechanical science engineers were left to
battle it out. Cash passed back and forth
as each team hurriedly shook the coffee
bean tin can containing three gumball-
sized dice and tossed them out.

The mechanical science team hud-

' dled in a group, some wearing white T-

shirts with dark blue neck and sleeve
herns bearing the words “Bring It On”
underneath their Mega Man mascot,
clutching a stack of Pittopoly cash.

At 6 p.m., the game ended, and the

two teams cashed in their deeds and their I 

property developments.

VV1th assets totaling $39,000, the
mechanical science engineering team
won by a landslide. g

Their points were then added to the
E—Week scoreboard-hanging in Benedum,
but the competition is not over yet, as
more games and challenges are scheduled
for the remainder of the week. '

Teams of engineering students competed in a. six-hour game of Pittopoly, played

on a 6-foot-by-6-foot game board inside Benedum Hal].

seizure procedures. Representatives from
the American Civil Liberties Union have
said that these expansions dilute due
process by relaxing the burden of proof that
law enforcement ofﬁcials must show to a
judge in order to obtain a search warrant.
“Our beef is not with the entire PATRI-
OT Act,” said Barb Feige, director of the
ACLU’s Greater Pittsburgh chapter.
‘‘There’s much in this act that’s written
within the realms of the Bill of Rights and

_ the Constitution, and that makes us safer

—— except for a few provisions.”

Feige explained that one part of the
act, which empowers the FBI to access per-
sonal information simply by stating that the
materials had a suspected relationship to an
ongoing terrorism investigation, infringes
on the Fourth Amendment by reducing the
requirement for probable cause.

But Corallo disagrees.

“’I'hat’s absolutely false. Probable
cause has not been redeﬁned by the
PATRIOT Act. Fourth Amendment protec-
tions against unreasonable search and

seizure are fully emphasized,” Corallo’

said.

The act also includes a deﬁnition of
“domestic terrorism” that Feige said is so
ambiguous that it could include groups like
Greenpeace, or anarchist‘ groups.

“There are perfectly legal groups prac-
ticing civil disobedience against which the
PATRIOT Act could be used,” Feige said.

Again, Corallo disagrees.

“That’s just absurd,” Corallo respond-
ed. “Peaceful political organizations
engaging in political advocacy obviously
do not come under this deﬁnition.”

Feige also said that, within Western
Pennsylvania, the only cases where provi-
sions of the USA PATRIOT Act were used
involved drugs and child pornography.

“I’m not saying that these people
shouldn’t have been prosecuted,” Feige

. said, “but the PATRIOT Act 'isn’t being

used to combat terrorism.”

But Corallo said such uses weren’t
necessarily negative.‘ .

“No one ever said that this act should
[be limited to terrorism,” he said. “It’s
adjustments to regular criminal law that are
able to be applied to terrorism, to make it
tougher for terrorists to avoid the law.”

“Any law on the books could be
abused. That’s why we have checks and
balances,” Corallo continued.

Feige, however, is not convinced that
the proper checks and balances are in place
under the act. -

“We’re once again back to the govem-
ment saying, ‘Trust us not to abuse the

A powers we’ve been given,’ and a lot of us

look at history and see abuses by both
Republicans and Democrats, and we’re not
sure we’re ready to trust this administra-
tion, or any future administration, ‘with
these powers,” Feige said.

Academia enters the fray

1

Act author wants coolcrdcbatc

Viet Dinh, a former Justice
Department oﬂicial who now teaches law
at Georgetown University, is one of the
principal authors of the USA PATRIOT
Act. He thinks that the current arguments

concerning the act are too partisan to allow, .

the facts to emerge.

“I do think this process needs a lot less
heat and a lot more light,” Dinh said.

“I think that many people have a gen-
uine but unfounded fear. The powers here
were not created by the PATRIOT Act -
[the act] made incremental changes to
existing law. It’s unfortunate that these are
sexy political issues.”

Jules Lobel and Kris W. Kobach are
also law professors who specialize in
Constitutional law. Lobel teaches at the
University of Pittsburgh, and Kobach
teaches at the ‘University of Missouri.

“There’s tremendous potential for
abuse,” Lobel said. “I think that’s what the
worry is with the ACLU.”

Lobel, who also specializes in human
rights issues, said that some of the biggest
changes to existing law involve how long
officials can delay telling a person about a
served warrant to obtain or inspect person-
al information in one’s home or elsewhere.

Kobach, in a letter written to the
Lawrence, Mo., City Commission on Jan.
27, said that warrants issued under the act
to investigate someone’s property and
information without their knowledge must
be approved in tenns of a foreign intelli-
gence or international terrorism investiga-
tion. ‘

L Kobach, who served as counsel to
Attorney General John Ashcroft from
2001-2003, wrote the letter urging the
Lawrence City Commission to reject a res-
olution similar to Resolution 60. ‘

“In my private capacity, as I am no
longer an employee of the Department of
Justice . . . [there’s] a nationwide effort by
a few interest groups to spread misinfor-
mation about the act,” he wrote. ‘This
campaign has led to false claims that the
act has in some way restricted the civil lib-

erties of American citizens.”

Sheppard feels that inadequate judicial
oversight exists for the more controversial
provisions of the act.

“Look, these are issues that are going

to be decided by nine of the smartest

lawyers in the land,” Sheppard said, speak-
ing about the Supreme Court “But people
need to educate themselves about ﬂiese
provisions.”

The act —— which was passed in 2001
— contains several provisions dealing with
surveillance issues that are set to expire in
December of next year unless renewed by
Congress.

It retains provisions that expand gov-
emment investigative authority, according
to the Electronic Privacy Information
Center’s Web site.

Dinh said that, after the current politi-
cal season ebbs, he is conﬁdent that the
truth about the USA PATRIOT Act will
emerge over the course of national debate.

Arrests, danger couldn’t deter student from pursuing writing

Okema, page 1

Okema said he is currently in the
process of suing La Roche, so that no
one else must suffer the same
“heavy-handed” treatment.

A However, he is quick to "add that
“my experience with the American
people has been a positive one.”

Okema is from the town of Gulu,
in the northern region of Uganda. In
high school, he was a student activist
involved in a successful campaign to
demand proper educational facilities,
qualified teachers, decent food and
the removal of corrupt school offi-
cials. '

While still in high school, he was
arrested-by the government.

He had ridden his bicycle to the
outskirts of town to collectfruit. As
he returned home, he encountered
soldiers who believed rebels were in

the area and became suspicious of

him.

Okema spent the next nine weeks
in a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with 21
other people. He‘ and the other cap-
tives slept standing up or on top .of
each other. For four days, he went
without food. .

“That was the worst ‘experience
I’ve ever had.” _

Recounting this episode, Okema
was still able to maintain a sense of
humor. He recounted how the sol-
diers would count them by hitting
each of the captives on the head with
a stick. Part way through tallying the
prisoners, the soldier would “forget”
the count and start over, Okema
recalled with laughter.

The experience didn’t deter him
from taking risks. While attending
classes at Makerere, the national uni-
versity of Uganda, he obtained a job
with The Monitor, a local newspaper.

The‘ paper sent him north, into
northern Uganda southern Sudan,

A where more experienced reporters

didn’t wish to go. Journalists had
been killed in the region and “either
the rebels would arrest you and kill
you, or the government would arrest
you for perceived bias, he explained.

“The! people in that part of the
country are some of the most impov-
erished in the world,” he added.-

On one occasion, Okema wit-
nessed the effects of a bombing of
refugees by Sudan. The injuries he
saw led him to believe the Sudanese
government was using chemical war-
fare.

“It was really horrible.”

The people were caught between
the rebels, known as the Lord’s
Resistance Army, and the govern-
ment. '

After Okema wrote a story men-
tioning the deaths of government
troops, he was arrested and placed in

l

a safe house for two days. After other
reporters inquired into his where-
abouts, he was driven some distance
and dropped off on. the side of a
street. S

“I felt good; I was trying to do
something,” Okema said of his sec-
ond experience being arrested. ‘-‘But I
felt inadequate.” He was frustrated
that the information contained in his
dispatches wasn’t reaching the inter-
national community.

Since coming to Pittsburgh, he
has continued to write, but his inter-
ests have gravitated toward activism.
He helped establish the African
Transatlantic Alliance, a nonprofit

organization dedicated to helping
African immigrants who settle in
Pittsburgh integrate into their new
environment.

Okema believes the relationship
between the City of Pittsburgh and
immigrants-is mutually beneficial.

' “Even if they come from very
impoverished backgrounds, there are
lots of good things that they bring,”
he said, pointing to their different
viewpoints and ways of achieving
goals, which can be beneficial in
business and elsewhere. A

He hopes’ students ’ will “get
involved in the activities of these
new immigrants” and attempt to

broaden their knowledge of other
countries, and he asked Americans to
keep in mind that the negative
images of Africa presented in the
media aren’t the whole picture.

“There are lots of positive things
that are happening in African coun-
tries,” Okema noted. .“Uganda has
really strong economic potential”
and possesses many natural
resources and thriving small busi-
nesses. -

“My appeal to people from the
United States, including students, is
to take an interest in these things,” he
said. “The best way to serve the
world is to get involved.”

ly surprised to ﬁnd that they aren’t official
Web sites, but instead a porn and two humor
sites, respectively. But then, given the hype
over whitehouse.com —— which boasts more
than 85 million visitors since 1997 — per-

haps not

Stuart Lawley, who started

Oneview.net, a United Kingdom Internet

provider, wants to clear up such confusion.
He recently submitted a proposal to the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers that would make .xxx a top-
level domain name for Internet porn sites, so
that searchers could more easily access porn,
andsothatpomconrparriesthatwantedto
make what they sold explicitly clear could
register for around a $75 fee.

The .xxx domain has been proposed
and rejected before. In an odd instance of
politicians and pomographers agreeing, in
2001, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich, advocated
itasameansofprotectingkidsﬁomthe
“awful, awful ﬁlth which is sometimes
widespread on the Internet,” according to a
March 22 news.com article. '

All of this is a good business venture,
but it also brings issues about ﬁee speech and
the applicability of this to the Internet sex
business. Pom sites would voluntarily buy

the .xxx domain name, which would mean
that some with famous names, like white-
house.corn, probably wouldn’t opt for the
new domain name.

So the “awful, awful ﬁl ” would strad-
dle to fence between .xxx and other domain
names, which would only partially keep
pom from impressionable, credit card—less
children. .

This would be the worst of both propos-
als — pom would be easier for consenting
adults to ﬁnd, a phrs, but also for children to
ﬁnd Given the glitches in some Internet ﬁl-
tration software —— some of which bans sex
education Web sites, but not porn — merely
ﬁltering out .xxx Web sites wouldn’t neces-
sarily protect children.

‘ And if the United States government
compelled all sex-related Web sites to regis-
ter at .xxx, such regulation might inﬁinge on
free speech. What, after all, constitutes sex?
It’s a question neither Bill Clinton, nor most
people, can answer deﬁnitively. ’

In fact, the American Civil Liberties
Union’s head of technology and liberty pro-
gram expressed concern about creating a
worldwide red-light district, in which gov-
ernments could relegate speech they consid-
ered offensive, but wasn’t necessarily pom.

The .xxx domain looks to be a proﬁtable
business venture for Lawley, but would lead
to murky legal matters. And none of this
would prevent people ﬁorn stumbling onto
whitehouse.corrr, only to wonder if Clinton
were, in fact, still in oﬂice.

Blowing up an anthill and other formative experiences

Ah, spring. That fecund time of year when pasty
pseudo-intellectuals sprout up all over Frick Park,
burning in the midday sun as they hold court on
notions of Art and Beauty.

Aside to those short—short-wearing girls playing
Frisbee: I work so hard to create this facade of inter-
minable wisdom —— can I at least get a smile? Do you
know how many Shakespearean love sonnets I could
recite if only you’d look this way? I’m
not invisible! I’m interesting!

But enough of all that. The point is
that we were sitting in Frick Park read-
ing and trying not to notice the girls not
noticing us. Suddenly, two screaming,
three-foot blurs shot past —— children of
some type, apparently. Trailing behind
them like a weary marathoner was the
mother’s plaintive cry, “Timmy! [Not
his real name.] Don’t run! I don’t want
your sisters running!”

Don’t run? In the park? Outside, on
the nicest day this frozen asteroid of a
city has seen in months? Are you seri-
ous?

If the 60-plus degree springtime outdoors is not
the place for running — or frolicking, gamboling,
larking, romping, etc. — then what’s the point of
leaving the house? Why not plop the kids down in
front of Sega’s “Frick Park,” the home game? It’s like
going outside, but without all the danger: cathode
rays instead of sunlight, pixels instead of dirt.

I thought Hysterical Apron-String Mom an aber-
ration, some deranged escapee from the Ward for
Overprotective Mothers. Ten minutes later, I heard

 

Jesse Hicks

Columnist

another HAM say, “No, honey, lets not go on the

chin-up bars, it looks like there’s mud under there.” V

The father chimed in, “And it looks like there’s‘ rust,
too.”

Good Lord. I was surrounded by pod people. And
they were breeding.

A lot of people complain about the youth of today,
about the teenagers with their piercing, gene-splicing
and, in general, growing of new oriﬁces.
I’m more concerned with those teens’ older
brothers and sisters, those new parents who

deciding if young Billy can climb a tree.
They’re everywhere, and they’re turning the
children (our future) into tiny, easily man-
aged accountants. .

Let me tell you about one of my for-
mative childhood experiences. One summer,
a large anthill appeared in our yard. It kept
getting bigger, bustling with larger and larg-
er numbers of big, red ants. One day, my dad
grabbed a kerosene can and said it was time
to “take care of those [ants].” If they didn’t
burn, they’d drown in a pool of kerosene. Then Dad
dropped the match.

The ﬁve—foot ﬁreball was the coolest thing my
young eyes had ever seen. It seemed to reach thesky.
I don’t remember if I lost my eyebrows, but if so, they
grew back, and I was a better man for having experi-
enced some serious backyard pyrotechnics.

When I look at these safe, bland children not
allowed to stray from the safety of well-paved paths,
I shudder. Have their parents —— they of the matching
sunglasses, close-cropped hair and creepily assonant

stop to calculate actuarial tables before

names (“Hi, we’re Todd and Terril”) — ever blasted a
hillful of ants, leaving only a scorched crater in the
lawn? I doubt it. Their lawns are too well manicured

. for ants or craters.

I’m not suggesting a national “Blow Up
Something With a Child Day.” What worked for me
won’t work for everyone. But remember why every-
one wants to be a child again: Children aren’t bound
to the arbitrary rules we adults agree to follow.
They’re allowed to run in the park, get dirty and rusty,
and have fun. They don’t have to fret over whether the
rust will cause tetanus or whether the mud will stain
their new clothes. That’s part of a parent’s job, but
another part is to know that real fun always has an
element of risk. Trying to shield your. kid from every
danger, real or imagined, only makes for another gen-
eration of well-trained pod people. .

The horror of the HAMs made me fear for the
future of the Republic, in my typically self-important
way. Just when the day seemed darkest, I heard anoth-
er mother’s voice: “Maverick! Run, Maverick, run!”

His name is Maverick. As in ‘Top Gun,” Tom‘

Cruise, -“Maverick.” At ﬁve years old, he’s already a
-thousand times cooler than I will ever hope to be.
With a name like Maverick, he will be both a rock star
and an astronaut. He doesn’t stay on the path with
everyone else — he makes his own rules. No one tells
him not to run,'and if there’s any justice in this world,
he is the future. »

If I were cool enough to be Ice Man, I’d tip my
Wings and say, “Godspeed, Maverick.”

Advice for the broke: Don’t put all your money on one toumament

-—j__. ....._.. _l .

Fact: In the first post—spring break
week of the semester, my checking
account had plummeted to new depths
of pathetic — rivaling that of potato
stock, now that the developed world has
entered the era of the “low-car ” diet.

By “pathetic,” I mean that I needed
to go check my balance before going to

Wendy’s to buy a mandarin chicken .

salad, to make sure I wouldn’t overdraw
my account and get charged $30. I’ll
give ya two guesses as to how I’ve
obtained such extensive knowledge
about the ol’ penalty ﬁne.

Ever the optimist — actually more
like a completely out-of-touch—With-
reality Stooge — I developed a sure-ﬁre
plan to bail myself out of the bowels of
ﬁnancial despair, No, I didn’t go out
and get a job. I’ve yet to reach such a
stage of complete and utter desperation.

Donating my body to science isn’t
really my thing, and besides, all those
research studies always want smokers,
or the “sibling of a schizophrenic in
their mid-20s with brown hair.” And

= answering one of those “Female wanted

for non-sexual massage, must be l8”
ads is just a little beyond sketchy in my
book. _

My ‘get-rich-quick scheme comes in
the form of entering myself in two of

my friends’ March Madness pools.
After winning, I’d be the recipient of a
glorious $250 — nearly 62 mandarin
chicken salads!

I immediately signed on to
espn.com, printed out my brackets and
began ﬁlling out my version of the
NCAA’s tourney fate. “With
every stroke of my pen, I
felt a twinge of pain for all
those poor suckers out there
from whom I would ulti-
mately be snatching cold,
hard cash.

To reinforce my deci-
sions, Igdecided to bring out
the big guns and call for
backup. After 20 minutes on
the phone with my dad, I
knew that I had in my pos-
session the two most inge-
niously derived brackets v
anyone other than the big guy upstairs
could possibly have conceived of.

‘Sti'll‘living in a utopian bubble uni-
verse created by my extremely overcon-,
ﬁdent — and false — sense of colle-
giate basketball knowledge, I handed in
my brackets along with my requisite $5
addition to the pool.

the games begin and wait for dough to

start rolling in. The only person who’d
_have an easier time than me cashing in
would be Donald Trump’s heirs — and
they’ll have to wait for tl1eir.old man to
kick the bucket.

When game day finally rolled
around, I had to survive a full day of
classes before I could check
my progression into the

have been misaligned on
that particular Thursday,
because the winners of the
ﬁrst round of games were
not the same teams that I
had foreseen to be victori-
.ous the day before.

me! BYU, I didn’t care who
you lost to, as long as it
wasn’t Syracuse — any-

body but them. The only upset 'I’d suc-

cessfully predicted was Manhattan. ‘ A

At this point, any sane individual
would have faced the facts, pulled out
the classiﬁed section and began job
hunting. But I’m much more delusional
than that, and clung to some artiﬁcial
light at the end of the tunnel where the
pool’s fortune was mine for the taking.

arrive, I stupidly sat waiting for Dayton
to pull out a win over DePaul.

At the close of Friday’s games,
even I couldn’t continue to lie to myself
about my’ source of next month’s

jncome. To make sure I got the point,

the basketball gods threw in the whole
Gonzaga ﬁasco on Saturday to really
drive the nail into the cofﬁn.

Even though I’m not going to be
instantly $250 richer anytime soon —
because both my brackets had suc-
cumbe'd to the same fate as the Titanic
— all is not lost. I had an entire week-
end ﬁlled with free entertaimnent, com-
pliments of some nail—biting, top-notch

concerned. _ ’

I like Hanson. .

That’s right, you heard me correctly —— I like
Hanson. I’ve liked them since I was 14 years old. I
was in 8th grade when Hanson took over the music

while getting his or her groove on? So here’s your

chance to do it — admit those secret bands to the a

scene with the rambunctious “MMMBop.” I was
smitten. While my friends were prank-calling boys
that they liked, I was kissing posters of Taylor
Hanson and wishing him goodnight before I went
to bed. ,

_ When I found out that Hanson was touring
back in 1997, I begged my parents to drive me

down to Bristow, Va., to see the band, because. ‘

they were not coming anywhere close to my
hometown. At the concert, I shrieked, “I love
you!” about every three minutes along with the
crazy teenage girls. If I had worn a bra at the time,
I swear I would have thrown it on stage.

Though I may not be proud of the fact that I

  

proclaiming that I love Hanson.
Don’t shut yourself in aroom
and listen to your tunes in
shame. Why not proclaim it
from the rooftops? Go ahead,
Metallica-fan, it’s perfectly ﬁne
to shout, “I love Mariah Carey’s
music” out to the world. I’m
sure it will makeyou feel much
better about yourself.

Which band is it for you?
It’s funny how much people
will admit to you once you have
divulged that youlike Hanson.

Sarah Butchin

was borderline-obsessed -— OK, fully obsessed —
with,Hanson, I am glad’ that, as Hanson’s music
matured, I did as well. But I’m not writing this to
persuade you to like Hanson’s music. I’m simply
saying that we all have a band we’_re scared to admit
we like. Everyone has his or her own personal
“Hanson.” Don’t pretend that you didn’t have a
Vanilla Ice cassette tape, and that you still feel elat-
ed when “Ice Ice Baby” comes on the radio. I know
you have danced to the “Macarena” and I would put
money down that you liked it.

It’s like they try’ to "relate by
telling you some shocking band
or artist that they like as well.

I’ve heard it all. There have been the guys that,

raved about their fascination with the powerful
vocals of Michael Bolton. You might think I’m lying,
but I’m telling the truth. You know when you’re
passing by “smooth sounds of the ‘80s and ‘90s,”
your heart leaps with glee when you hear asappy
love song. like “When a Man Loves a Woman.”
Then there’s_ the good Christian girl thatloves

i “Closer” by Ninelnch Nails. She gets off thinking

about the way Trent Reznor groans about his carnal

“MMMBOP,” you got a problem?

desires. She feels the beat just the same way that a

hard rocker does and loves it just the same. You

Inight think it’s a myth, but she’s out there.

I’ll never forget the day my punk rock friend and
I were in the car together. I was ﬂipping through the
stations to ﬁnd something decent that both of us
could agree to listen to. I hit 96.1 KISS FM and
“Toxic” by Britney Spears inﬁltrated the car.

I thought to myself, “Sarah, be nice; you can’t
put him through that,” so I turned the knob to the
next station. “You can turn that back,” he said non-
chalantly. “No,” I replied, “I know it’s not your
scene.” I continued to inch further and further up the

dial when he reached over and put the radio back to .

KISS. I was shocked. Could he actually enjoy listen-
ing to Britney Spears‘? With that, my hypothesis that
everybody has that one shameful band oraxtist was
proved to be true.

Life is too short to worry about what other peo-
ple think about you. Be proud of your preferences,
even if you yourself can admit that your favorite
band is a little out of character. Variety is the spice of
life. Mix it up a little bit and enjoy a song that you
never would have listened to because of the social
stigma.

If you asked me what the best days of my life
were, the three times I met Hanson are high up on
that list. Why would I deny something that makes me
so happy just because it is not cool? Be proud of
your secret band and enjoy listening to their music
with your door open and your guard down.

 SuperBomb is bigger than your Super Missile

‘K Metroid: Zero Mission

Developed by Nintendo and
R&D‘l

Game Boy Advance
ms.-.~:1/2,

Nintendo started with “Metroid” in

- 1986, and has since devoted nearly

half a dozen games to expanding the
story of Samus Aran. In those 18 years,
timelines have been split, spliced _and
altered in an attempt to bring cohesion
to the tale, and it came upon Nintendo

to rewrite history a bit to fill in the

holes.
Enter “Metroid: Zero Mission.” In

I this remake of the original “Metroid,”

we learn how Samus dealt with her
first mission on the planet Zebes.
However, the storyline has been

_ extended to butt right up against the

beginning of “Metroid Prime.” The
gameplay and’ layouts were derived
from the original material, but the sim-
ilarities end there.

‘First of all," the graphics -have

undergone a major overhaul. Sprites
are cleaner, effects are ﬂashier, bosses

are larger — even l994’s “Super

Metroid” for the Super Nintendo pales
in comparison. The background music
has also been updated to just—beyond-
16-bit standards, which only adds to

the mildly spooky nature of the game-
play.

Further, the weapon selection has
been expanded to . include Super
Bombs, Super Missiles, heat-resistant
suits and some upgrades that will leave
you puzzled for a while. However, this

COURTESY NINTENDO

« repertoire creates some rather complex

button combinations for attacks and
techniques that can sometimes cause
problems, given how quickly you have
to switch between them.

Despite the slight control issue, the
rest of the presentation is nearly ﬂaw-
less. A well-stocked options menu
includes a gallery feature, sound cus-
tomization (for optimal performance
using either the system speakers or
headphones), unlockable content via a
link with “Metroid Fusion,” and even
the original “Metroid” once you’ve
ﬁnished the game. , '

One of the recent trends in the
gaming world is a push toward nostal-
gia, as many gamers hit their twenties.
With “Metroid: Zero Mission,”
Nintendo has breathed life into a title
that’s old enough to vote and turned it
into a must—have game for your Game
Boy Advance. What seemed to be a lit-
tle bit of storyline house cleaning has
become one of my favorite games this
year.

THE PITT NEWS"

Wednesday, March 24, 

The Recording Industry
Association of America is at it
again. But does it really matter?’

Five hundred and thirty-two
more people were sued this week
for illegally sharing digital music
via the Internet. Included were
scores of people using computer
networks at 21 universities.

The bad guy in all of this is the
RIAA, which, over the past few
years, has been trying to scare peo-
ple, especiallycollege students, to
make them stop downloading music
online. Newsflash — it hasn't
stopped students from download-
ing; it has only limited how much
they download.

Now, including the recent 532,
the RIAA has filed lawsuits against
1,977 people, 400 of which have
been settled out of court. That’s a
lot of people to sue, and for what?
Checking out a new song by a band
your friend told you about?

You aren’t sure the entire album
is worth paying for but just want
that one song, and of course, the
record stores in the area don’t carry
singles. So now the price of wanti-
ng to experience something before
you hand over $20 for a new piece
of plastic is going to run a cool
$3,000, which you could have used
to buy a hell of a lot of worthless
music that the RIAA doesn’t want

you to download.

So the RIAA has sued '
almost 2,000 people, and
the downloading still
continues, especially on
college campuses. Should
we ‘all hide under our
desks and fear the RIAA
is coming after us? Delete
our hard drive of any pos-
sibly copyrighted music
and just go buy the crap-
py albums that those
songs are on?

Well, you should still
be buying albums, albeit
not the crappy ones, but
sometimes they just sneak up on
you when you aren’t looking. But I
think what’ the RIAA is trying to
hinder is people downloading entire
albums onto their computer and
then not buying the actual hard
copy. I will admit that I download
music on my computer, and I know
just about everyone on campus does
the same. But I still buy albums ..
a lot. I think there’s something
about opening the shrink wrap and
leafing through the liner notes that
just makes the listening experience
much more enjoyable.

But should the RIAA hammer
down on everyone even if they only
download a single here and there?
Honestly, I’m not going to go buy

 

Twista’s Kamikaze just
for the‘ single “Slow
Jamz.” It’s a good song,
but I don’t like rap
music enough- to invest
$18.98 on an album that
I will only listen to
once, then only play the
' one-song I like.

So no, RIAA, you
should not hammer
down on everyone. Stay
away from the kids who
have a single here and
there on their hard drive.
Stay away from all of us

" who choose to down-
load. Yes, it’s a shame that some
people choose to. download "an
entire album, but is it worth suing a
college student who is already in
debt? Is it worth suing a high school
kid who doesn’t have $100, let
alone $3,000.

Of course, my plea and every
other plea will go unheard by the
RIAA, even though the recording
industry and artists aren’t losing
that much money from download-
ing. And they won’t stop releasing
albums. But if they did, that then
they wouldn’t make any money
whatsoever.

And if another band goes on

.MTV and complains about down-

loading, turn off your television and

, . . . , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . l . . . . . . . . « . . « — / . . . . A ~

 Leave the kids alone. Let the music taste freedom

stop listening to their music,
because they-don’t. get much from
album sales anyway. They -have to
release an album so that people will
listen to their music. People have to
listen to their music; so they can sell
concert tickets, and that’s where
they make the ‘majority of their
money: ticket sales and merchan-
dise sold at the shows. It costs
money to "make money .and some-
times it’s a bitch. But those are the
ropes, and frankly, no one will ever
listen to a new artist if they can’t
get a free sample here and there.
Basically, the RIAA is not going
to stop their rampage on file shar-
ing. And now that they are invading

‘college networks to look into stu-

dents’ computers, it’s getting worse
than before. So show the RIAA
what everyone already knows.
Show them that album sales are fine
if the album is good enough to buy;
buy that album you can’t live with-
out.

But if there’s just one song on
the album, that you like, use your
decision-making skills and deter-
mine whether it’s worth the chunk
of change that you could‘ use for
something else. Or perhaps, buy it
and give the other songs a chance.
Who knows? You might like the
whole album. Just don’t download
the whole album.

In an attempt to reach All-
American wrestler status, four out
of six Pitt wrestlers made it to the
second day of the NCAA
Championships. However, none of
the four finished in the top eight of
their weight class to be given that
title.

Pitt senior Josh Birt, a former
junior college champion, finished

American wrestler at 197 pounds.
Birt first disposed of the tourna-

ment’s No. 8 seed, Matt Greenberg

The Pitt softball team (11-15) rallied from an early

‘loss in the first day of the Capitol Classic in

Sacramento, California to win their last four games in a
homecoming of sorts for junior first baseman Casey
Pickard, sophomore pitcher Christa Hunter, and fresh-

— man shortstop Sheena Hellon, all native Californians.

“We have been inconsistent,” said Panther head
coach Michelle Phalen. “So it was nice to see our team
come out on Friday and play real‘ strong,.come out on
Saturday and play real “strong, and then finish the tour-
nament on Sunday playing really strong. It was good
because we haven’t done that yet. We played three real
good days of softba1l.” »

pitcher Laura Belardinelli gave up eight hits and three
runs in seven innings of work for Pitt, but it was all for
naught as Shelli Messer hammered a three-run homer in
the bottom of the tenth inning to give the Boilermakers
the win.

“The Purdue game was a great game,” Phalen said.
“They came up with the big hit to win the game. We had
opportunities to win it and put it away, but we just
couldn’t hold them off the bases as soon as we started
scoring.”

Early—round
upsets killed
my bracket

 

I had just ﬁnished broadcasting
Pitt’s dramatic 59-55 victory over
Wisconsin in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament. As I packed up the
radio equipment and gleefully strode
past the court, watching a sea of heart-
broken, scarlet-clad Midwesterners
exiting the Bradley Center in droves, I
noticed a small crowd congregating by
the television set in the media work-
room. \‘

Curious, I walked over to find that
the fuss was over another ‘basketball

- game. that was in its last minute. Mo

Finley of the ninth-seeded Alabama-
Birrningham Blazers had just hit a 17-
foot jump shot with 12.2 seconds left to
give his squad a 76-75 lead over the
nation’s No. 1 overall team, Kentucky.

A major upset was on the horizon. .
As Kentucky inbounded the ball and '

took it across the half court, tensions
were high. When Gerald Fitch
launched a potential game-winning
three-point shot with 2.2 seconds to go,
the room was silent. When Fitch’s shot
clanked off of the rim and Chuck
Hayes’ subsequent put-back went
errant, cheers of support for the under-
dog arose among most of the onlook-
ers.

And throughout all of this, still
high off of Pitt’s victory in a hostile
environment, I could think of only one
thing — my bracket was busted.

Completely.

Yes, I picked Kentucky to win the
national championship in the majority
of my office pools. And while I always
love the underdog in games I have no
emotional investment in, I couldn’t
help but brood over the fact that a boat-
load of prospective work-free money
had just gone down the drain after the
tourney’s first weekend. ‘ L" 1

Pitt wins three of four
despite injury to starter

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

Despite losing the team’s top
performer to an ankle injury, the

Pitt women’s tennis team won three

out of its last four matches to
improveits overall record to 7-2.
Laura Pegula sprained her right
ankle, but has been treated by train-
ers and should be ready to compete
in both singles and doubles play in
the team’s _ next match against

‘ Youngstown St. .
“[Pegula] was actually out run-

ning and hit some uneven pavement
and just sort of turned her ankle,”
head coach George Dieffenbach
said. .“She probably will have a
hard time getting it all the way back
to 100 percent, because we have
matches almost every day.”

S Pitt 6, Mercyhurst 3

'The Panthers won five out of six
singles matches and two out of
three doubles matches on their way
to an impressive victory.

Pegula, Becky Emmers, . Emily

Hughes and Konita Jude all won in

straight sets. .

“Mercyhurst was ranked No. 20
in the nation in Division II,”
Dieffenbach said. “It was a good
Win for us.”

St. John’s 6, Pitt 1

The Panthers had a tough time
against a strong opponent on the
second leg of their three-game road
trip.

Emily Hughes picked up the
lone point for the Panthers by
defeating Jennifer Liantonio 1-6, 7-
5 and 7-5. . ' » __

“It was a tough match for us,”
Dieffenbach said. “They have a real
good team, but we put up a good
fight. It was a good showing for our
team against a talented team.”

Pitt 5, St. Bonaventure 2
Pitt got back to its winning

ways against the Bonnies up in

Olean, N.Y., mostly due to strong
play i.n doubles matches.

Pegula was forced to sit out sin-
gles play due to an injury, but
Emmers filled in and never missed
a beat. S ‘ ’

Senior Hayley Hughes picked
up her 100th career win when she
defeated Lindsey Marshin straight
sets, 6-0 and 6-1.

Pitt 6, St. Francis 1

The Panthers returned to their
home court ‘ in Monroeville, Pa.,
with a bang,’as they won all singles
matches in straight sets.

“It’s been a lot of matches for

us in a row,” Dieffenbach ‘said
about his team competing in four
matches in as many days. “Our
team is definitely getting match
tough.” ’

Pegula was ‘again sidelined. for
singles play, but did manage to
compete in a doubles match. She
appeared to bebothered by that sore
right ankle, cringing and hobbling
at times. Pegula and doubles part-
ner Emily Hughes were competitive
throughout their match, but lost to
the No. l pairing of Amy Croskey
and Lesley Wenzel by the score of
8-6. .

Dieffenbach was particularly
impressed with the play of Emmers,
who played in the No. 1 spot and
defeated Croskey in straight sets, 6-
3 and 6-2. '

“We competed hard in singles
today,”' Dieffenbach said. “Becky
Emmers did particularly -well
against a pretty good opponent. The
players in singles matches are get-
ting more consistent. They’ve been
working very hard on footwork, and
it’s starting to pay of .”

Pitt will face Youngstown State
today at its home court, Oxford
Olympic Court in Monroeville.

“It’s a big match for us,”
Dieffenbach said. “[Youngstown
State] is always very talented, and
they compete hard. It’s going to be
a tough test for us.”

bounced back by defeating Lehigh’s
Matt Anderson by _a score of 4-2
and finished the day by defeating
Deonte Penn of Edinboro, 6-2. Penn
had defeated Kocher twice earlier
this season.

Kocher then notched his team-
leading 32nd victory of the year by
defeating Casey Olsen of Fresno
State, 3-2, before dropping a 5-2
decision to Jake Giamoni of North
Carolina State.

Francis Iorfido was narrowly
edged by the tournament’s No. 3
seed in the 174-pound weight class,
Brad Dillon of Lehigh, in the first
round, by a score» of 12-8. Iorfido
moved on with a win in the conso-

T lations over Levi Craig of Duke -—

a 13-3 major decision.

Iorfido lost his only bout on the
second day when he was pinned
with 24 seconds left in the first
period by Central Michigan’s Mitch

. Hancock.

Sophomore Zach Doll and
junior? Justin Nestor were both
defeated twice on the first day to be
eliminated from the tournament.

up 32nd win

Doll had a tough opening oppo-
nent at 165 pounds in No. 6 seed
Ralph Everett of Hofstra, and gave
everything he had before dropping a
tough 4-3 decision. Doll was then
defeated by Matthew Veach of
Eastern Illinois, by a score of 15-8.

Nestor, the Panthers’ 157-
pounder, was topped by No. 7 seed
Phillip Simpson of Army, by a 15-0
technical fall in the first round.
Nestor then ran into a familiar EWL
opponent in Charlie Brenneman;
but losta tough 5-3 decision to the
Lock Haven wrestler in the consola-
tions to finish his season with a 27-
16 record. .

The six Pitt wrestlers combined
to win seven bouts to tally up a total
team score of eight and a half
points, well behind team leader and
champion Oklahoma State, who fin-
ished with 123.5 points.

The end of the tournament
marks the end of the Panthers’ sea-
son, as they will now look forw3rd/
to winning the EWL next year. With’
Birt and P ‘heavyweight Travis
Shirley as the only two seniors on
this year’s team, nearly all of the
squad will return next season.

Cheering for the underdog not as fun when picking the favorite

Cunningham, page 15

And every year at this time, mil-
lions of NCAA tourney followers like
me worry themselves stupid over a
series of number-crunching, upset—cal—
culating, bracket—based office pools.
The NCAA bracket and its gambling-

,light association has become such a

large part of the American lexicon, that
the word “bracketology” has firmly
taken its place in the vernacular. It’s
ridiculous to think of grown men in
suits throwing bragging stock and cash
into a basketball tournament played by
college kids, then arguing about it for
three weeks. Still, this has been the

Do you love
the underdog
as much as

Michael
Cunningham?

Then maybe
you should be
his best friend.

Either way,
go to

www.pittnews.com
and check
out the new
men’s
basketball web

most frequent image I’ve. encountered
pretty much everywhere I’ve gone for
the last two weeks.

Admit it. You think you have a
“system” that will crack the random-
ness ‘ of ’ the tournament that is nick-
named “March Madness.” Your bracket
looks foolproof when you first turn it in.
A five beating a 12. The eights and
nines splitting across the board. Two
ones, a strong two, and a four in the
Final Four. 4

Then one of your Elite Eight teams
gets dumped on the first day. A national
championship participant is done by the
first weekend. And by the time April
rolls around and all is said and done,

your girlfriend wins, after picking the
bracket based on uniform color
schemes. ' _

It is an inexact science, this brack-
et—ﬁlling ridiculousness. UAB proved
that once again on Sunday, and I’ve let
myself get wrapped up in it again this
year. But this will change from now on.

I’m not filling out brackets any-
more. Part of the joy of watching the
tournament is the buzzer—beaters, the
upsets, and the individual performances
that turn college stars into NCAA
Tournament legends. I should have
been really excited for UAB because,
not only did it pull off a huge upset, but
they also opened up an easier road for

Pitt, should Pitt get to the Final Four.
Instead, I was more worried about my
bracket than I was about the action on
the court, which is why I watch college
basketball anyway.

Besides, good gambling logic states
that it is no good to fill out a tournament
bracket when a team that you root for is
participating. And considering Pitt’s
success over the last three years, and
their recruiting over the last two, this is
a program that should be playing deep
into March for several years to come.

Michael Cunningham is a senior staﬁ‘
writer for The Pitt News. He really
hopes that Pitt keeps winning.

THE PITT NEWS

Pitt softball returns to action thisweekend inMaryland

Softball, page 15

on a three-run blast to power the
Panthers to a 4-1 victory over Saint
Mary’s. Phalen was pleased with her
team’s overall defensive and offen-
sive efforts during the game.

“We had some outstanding
defense,” Phalen said. “We’re just
starting to put everything together,
and it was nice. The Saint Mary’s
game was a good game.”

Pitt 6, Tennessee State 1 (eight
innings) ’
Belardinelli and Bostick com-

bined to allow one run in eight
innings of work as the Panthers
earned their third consecutive victo-
ry of the weekend. Bostick would
later be named to the all-tournament
team as she compiled a record of 4-
1 over the course of the three days.

Pitt 2, Sacramento State 1
Against Sacramento State,
sophomore third baseman Jen
O’Donnell drove in Andrews fol-
lowing her double to give the
Panthers their fourth consecutive
win of the weekend. The win gave
Sacramento State its first loss of the

tournament and moved Pitt into a tie
with the Hornets for first place in
the tournament.

“We were 3-1 going into that
game and they were 4-0,” Phalen
said. “They pitched their top kid
against us and we didn’t manage a
lot of hits, but we took advantage of
an error that allowed us to keep
some runners on .[base].”

The Panthers are next in action
on Saturday when they will travel to
College Park, Md., to play in a four-
game tournament against Maryland,
Delaware State, and Columbia. First
pitch is scheduled for 11 a.m.
