VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 56

Pitt’s Delta Sigma Phi

suspended for violations  

NIKKI SCHWAB
Staff Writer

The mansion will still be green.

But the fraternity Delta Sigma Phi,
nicknamed the “green mansion” fraternity
for their large, green—brick house on
Dithridge Street,_is no longer.

On Sept 19, the University made a
decision, to no longer recognize Pitt’s
Omega chapter of the Delta Sigma Phi ﬁa-
temity. _

Their national organization’s grand
council reinforced this verdict on Sept. 24
with the decision to revoke the charter and
immediately close the chapter.

According to Bruce Hammond, the
organization’s national director of commu-
nications, the fraternity violated the Delta
Sigma Phi Policy on Responsibility and
Accountability. The policy includes serious
infractions, such as substance abuse and
hazing, and less serious infractions, such as
failure to abide by fire codes and problems
with special—events planning. I

“The speciﬁcs aren’t really that impor-

tant,” Hammond said. He added that the

Omega chapter of Delta Sigma Phi could
have violated one or a combination of these
policies.

Anita Triggs, Pitt’s Fraternity and
Sorority Life coordinator, said a complaint
detailing a hazing incident was ﬁled last
April with Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Judicial Aﬁairs.
This allegation led to dialogue between the
chapter, the University and the organiza-
tion’s national oﬂice for several months,
she added. ' .

Delta Sigma Phi was placed on interh
probation, meaning the fraternity was
unable to hold social ftmctions or attend
Greek-related events.

According to Triggs, the judicial

. board’s Sept. 19 decision was based on the

fact that the hazing allegation was substan-
tiated. The fratemity violated their interim
suspension by hosting a party and serving
alcohol to minors, causing them to lose
Pitt’s recognition. Triggs was one of the
three hearing officers on the judicial board

that made the University’s decision.
“We felt that the organization was
headed in the wrong direction, and the best

alternative was to [terminate] recognition,”

Triggs said. “The national oﬂice seemed to
agree with our ﬁndings.”

Sophomore Dante Renzulli was’ a
pledge for Delta Sigma Phi last spring and
made the allegation that hazing was present
during his pledge period. Renzulli said he
was hazed for almost three straight months,
but he continued to pledge anyway,
because it had been such a big time com-
mitment. .

Renz11lli said the brothers made him
“eat stuff that was kind of bad” such as a
two—pound tub of margarine, pickle juice,
Tabasco sauce and hot sauce. He said he
was also forced to go for two straight days
without getting any sleep.

According to Renzulli, he made it
through pledging until about the last week,
when, after a night of forced binge drink-
ing, he lost. control of himself. The brothers
told him the next day that he could no
longer pledge after the incident. , .

“The night before they told -me to
leave, they had made me drink a whole lot
of beer and vodka . . . beer first Q . . and I was
taking, shots of Scotch, too,” he said. “It
was more alcohol thanl have ever drank in
my life. Naturally, I got real out of control
 I don’t remember anything, but appar-
ently I got violent or something.”

After his dismissal, ‘Renzulli sent - a

statement about hisjexperiences at Delta
Sigma Phi to the University and the nation-
al fratemity. 

“Really the only reason I got them in
trouble is because they screwed me over,”
Renzulli said. '

According to former Delta Sigma Phi
President and Pitt senior Matthew Weaver,
“Our main problem is the way the whole

situation was handled by our nationals and _

the University. It seemed like we were
guilty until proven innocent the entire time,
and I was under the impression that our
nation worked the other way.”

Pitt’s diversity questioned by professor, students

MARIAH MOORE KHANNA
Staff Writer

Black students make up nearly
10 percent of Pitt’s student popula-
tion a proportion that has
increased since the fall of 2001,
when they made up 7.9 percent of
the population, according to Pitt’s
Fact Book.

But members of Pitt’s communi-
ty still can’t agree.whether or not
Pitt is diverse.

Those who believe that Pitt is
striving to create an increasingly
diverse campus include Jack
Daniel, the dean of students, and
Justine Hand, the Pitt Program
Council director. Daniel and Hand
point to the trend on campus of
bringing in more freshmen with
diverse backgrounds and bringing
in programs that cater to diversity.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
brought in more black freshmen in
the last two years than ever before,
according to Daniel.

Daniel also named prominent
black officials at Pitt, such as
Jeannette South-Paul, chairman of
the family medicine department,
Stephen B. Thomas, a researcher on
minority health, and Robert Hill,
vice chancellor for Public Affairs.

Hand, who believes Pitt is “very
diverse,”'mentioned the hip-hop
venue at PPC’s Fall Fest and a
Spanish foreign film that was pre-
sented to students as indicators of
her council’s contributions to diver-

sity with respect to how far Pitt has

years.

Departments such as the English
department are given more attention
and funding, according to Lillie. If
Africana Studies doesn’t offer the

ment, Lillie said, “I don’t know
what August Wilson and Toni

Continuing the tradition,
BAS hosts Dating Game

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

IfI were a fruit, what fruit would I be
and how would you eat me? If you were
an ice cream, what ﬂavor would you be
and why?

These were just some of the questions
asked Tuesday night at the Black Action
Society-sponsored Dating Game, held in
David Lawrence Hall as part of an effort
to promote campus
Homecoming. -

The game was divided into four sec-
tions, with each pairing up two single con-
testants for a dinner for two, compliments
of BAS T

Phinesse and "B-Bonics provided the

music for the dating game, while fresh-
man Tonya Groover and sophomore Chris
Holland hosted the game.

The hosts introduced each dating
hopeful with his or her year in college,
major and hometown. The participants’
names were not given, to avoid inﬂuenc-
ingthe contestants’ final decisions and
spoiling the surprise. .

* The concept of a Homecoming dating
game was not as new as it may have
seemed. BAS had held their own dating
games for the last few years.

interest -in

“It’s a tradition at BAS,” sophomore
Frances Taggert said.

Many students showed up to watch
the contestants answer questions, compete
for a chance to win a date and improvise
answers to the questions asked of them.

“It was interesting; it was funny; it
was fun to watch,” freshman Sade
Robbins said.

Some students were impressed at the
number of students who turned out to ﬁll
the auditorium, as well as how well-
planned and organized the activity was for
those who participated in the game.

“They did a good job putting it
together,” said game contestant Jason
Funderburk. “It was a good Homecoming
experience.” i ‘

This game was just one activity in a
larger series of events taking, place this
week as part of -Black Homecoming,
sponsored by BAS. Some of the other
events coming up include a spirit rally, a
comedy show and an after-game party.

So, to prepare for the next dating
game, sit down and pick a song that
describes you, decide what your best
attribute is, and try to answer the all-
important question:

If she could, how would your mom
describe you?

Councilman tries to restore Zone‘  

4 police station after budget cuts

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

Several city councilmen, police
officers and community residents
are unhappy with the final results of
the cut—and—paste style that has
seemed tobe present during recent
changes in Pittsburgh’s police
department. 6

On Aug. 29, 2003, the former
Zone 4 police station
in the »West End
closed its doors for
the last time. The
West End station,
which provided police
coverage for the area
of the city over the
Monongahela River

Circle and Mt.
Washington, is now
patrolled by the cur-
rent Zone 3 police

“Closing the station itself is a
reduction of services, and Murphy
has agreed to maintain the same
level of services despite thecuts,”
Hertzberg said. 7

According to Ewin, the police

than just the streets. Officers. must
also occupy the building. V

. “The reopening of that station
would require us to
take up to 23 officers
off the streets,” Ewin
said.

“There are

borhoods that used

According to attorney and City
Councilman Alan Hertzberg, the
city of Pittsburgh’s Chief of Police
Robert McNeilly made the layoff

According to Tammy Ewin, the
public informationrofficer of the
city of Pittsburgh, the city was able
to bring back nine of the 102 police
officers laid off, thanks to early
retirement by veteran police offi-
cers. A

“We bring back officers as offi-

we’ve brought back about 25 more

Gerideau and" Jones both point-

‘ was not allowed to use the Petersen

its use for a presentation.

“They spent" all that money on
[the Pete], and who .is it for?”
Gerideau asked. She added that
BAS was told, “‘Student organiza-
tions cannot use it.”’

Jones added that, as the Pe.te
went up last year, so did tuition.

In addition to commenting on
how “Pitt’s money could contribute
to diversity, Jones asked, “Why
doesn’t Pitt have a multicultural
department? Other universities do.”

Black, students make up the
largest minority population of Pitt
students, followed by Asian stu-
dents, who made upp4.4 percent of

their organizations provide diversi-
ty and create understanding of cul-

‘ ture for students who seek a place

to identify with others.

Ver said Pitt has come a. long
way in recognizing diversity in the
last decade, and he cited his organi-
zation’s privilege of governance
status as an example. Governance

status allows a student organization
to receive more funding from the
student government board when its
student body i.s significantly larger
than other organizations.

The ASA has about 500 mem-
bers, as does BAS, which also has
governance status.

Ver sees diversity as not only a
responsibility for the University to
take on, but for students to take on
as well. “Student apathy” is partly
to blame for any lack of diversity
on campus, he said.

Marr, who shares the same
proactive perspective on diversity
that Ver mentioned, said that being

black and Muslim does not mean
she only associates with people of
either group. Marr spoke about the
satisfaction she gets from mixing
with many people of differing races
and religions, such as white,
Catholic, Baptist or Muslim.

“Most people have a one—track
mind, so a mixture of people is

cool,” Marr said.

Marr takes that philosophy into
her organization. Marr networked
with BAS and Pitt’s multicultural
sorority to create presentations on
Islamic culture, as well presenta-
tions focusing on Muslims and non-
Muslims interacting peacefully.

Brother says Board made
its verdict before the trial

Delta Sigma Phi, page 1

Weaver added that Delta Sigma Phi
alumni and brothers had spoken on the ﬁa-
temity’s behalf at the Student Judicial
System trial.

Sophomore and Delta Sigma Phi
brother Mike Hansen also said that “the

the actual event took place.”

“Unlike other fraternities, we were sin-
gled out for such things as underage drink-
ing, while any literate person can read the
multiple citations given to people ‘outside’

of hill fraternities in The Pitt News,”
Hansen said.

Hansen said the Delta Sigma Phi
pledge process had been a voluntary event
bringing together potential and current
members of the fraternity to promote
brotherhood.

Delta Sigma Phi was originally char-
tered at Pitt in 1916. Delta Sigma Phi’s
recognition at Pitt is terminated until all the
current members have graduated from the
University. Then, according to Hammond,

the fratemity “would like to return to the I

University of Pittsburgh.”

“The parties have not asked us to

The Athletic Training Student
Association has, adopted McKee
Place, from _ its intersection with
Louisa Street to Bates Street.

The group consists of students in
Pitt’s Undergraduate Athletic Training
Education Program.

“By ﬁeir nature, athletic trainers

help and take care of people,” ,
President Leigh Weiss said. “We
wanted to give back to the campus and
community.”
- Hoffman and Halula want to
stress that student groups’ blocks will
hardly be left unassisted in their
efforts.

V “The city of Pittsburgh, despite
financial troubles, is helping us by
donating supplies and agreeing to haul
trash,” Hoffman said.

Pitt is also providing supplies.

Hoffman and Halula have been
pleased with the number of groups
who have volunteered, but they would
like to expand the program and even— ~
tually take it to North Oakland.

EDITORIAL

General doesn’t speak for entire nation

Ill—reasoned remarks by a senior
U.S. military intelligence official
led President George W. Bush to
attempt to soothe tempers at a meet-
ing Wednesday on the island of
Bali.

Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin,
serving as a deputy undersecretary

of defense, was filmed, in uniform,

at various Christian functions,
speaking about the war on terror and
Muslims, saying they don’t worship
a real god, but instead worship an
idol.

In remarking on a Muslim sol-
dier in Somalia who claimed Allah’s
protection from U.S. forces, Boykin
said, “I knew that my God was big-
ger than his. I knew that my God
was a real God, and his was an
idol.” He has also portrayed the war
on terror as a war on Satan,
“because we’re a Christian nation.”

Bush, by way of an apology, told
an assembly of Muslim clerics
Wednesday that Boykin’s remarks
don’t “reflect what the government
thinks.”

While it’s heartening to see
Bush distancing himself from one of
his fellow evangelical Christians,
the president stopped shamefully
short of condemning Boykin out-
right.

Boykin’s remarks are just the
kind of small-minded, pathetic big-

otry that is keeping our nation firm-
ly in the sights of fundamentalist
terror groups. Not only are they
incendiary and stupid, they are
untrue.

America is not a Christian

nation. We are a nation of diverse‘

faiths, and we were founded on

sacred freedoms, not the least of ‘

which is of religion. For such a
high—ranking official as Boykin to
tell the world that we are fighting
terror based on religious differences

is an abhorrent lie, and ought to be

proclaimed as such.

The sad truth is that this dogma-
tist,’s hateful speech is going to be
picked up and broadcast throughout
the Muslim world, further straining
relations between them and us.
Boykin is going to be the face of
America to countless Muslims and
others throughout the world.

We aren’t fighting a holy war.
There is no American jihad. The war
on terrorism is just that,‘ an attempt
to stop terror in the world. It’s not
an attempt to shove Christianity
down the planet’s throat —— at least,
that’s what the Bush administration
has led us to believe.

But Bush’s failure to censure
Boykin comes frighteningly close to
tacit approval, and for those
Americans not fighting a holy war,

that is terrifying.

Forging new traditions for Homecoming

NEWSMAKER
Liz Culliton, SGB President

It is that ‘ time of year again:
Homecoming. And once more, we ﬁnd
ourselves doing the same things we have
done every year — perhaps attending the
laser‘ show Friday night, or tailgating for
the game on Saturday. Do you ﬁnd your-
self wanting more out of our homecom-
ing? I know many people have. I have.

The University of Pittsburgh is a

fine institution. We are known for our .

achievements academically and athleti-
cally. However, students tend to get lost
in the shuffle. This is not to say that we

do not have quality programs available

to us here. This is not to say that we do
not have quality student organizations.
What I am saying is that Pitt sometimes
lacks traditions to hold on to.

Vlfith a campus like we have, many
times, students feel as if they are not a
part of it. Perhaps you live next to a fam-
ily in South Oakland, or an elderly cou-
ple in North Oakland. Anywhere you
live, there seems to be a lack of commu-

nity; a lack of continuity. This is by no

means anyone’s fault. It can only be
blamed on the nature of our campus’ ori-
entation.

Where am I going with all of this?
What we need are more traditions. What
we need are more things to look forward
to, more events to be excited about and
more reason to show our Pitt Pride.

This year, in an effort to help mend.

that lack of community, Student
Government Board is taking action. On
Friday, Oct. 24th, this campus will be a
sea of blue and gold. Maybe you have
seen the advertisements or ﬂiers, or
maybe even heard the buzz around carn-
pus. This Friday will be .officially
Panther Pride-Campus Wide. We are try-
ing to get the entire campus to wear blue
and gold on Friday. We have prizes for

everyone who comes to the Quad
between 5 and 8 p.m. dressed in Pitt
attire. _ ' A r

In an attempt to dress up our carn-
pus, we have organized a bannercontest
in the Quad from 12-4 p.m., where stu-
dents will have four hours to make, an
original Pitt Pride banner to be displayed
in the Union. In addition to hanging the
banners, we will _have prizes from the
athletics department to give away to the

‘winners. To keep the spirit of the event,

we have scheduled a D] to play all day in
the Quad.

If you have‘ ever wanted to learn
some old Pitt cheers, we have the Pitt
cheerleaders, along with a group of spir-
ited students, coming to help teach some
cheers to the crowd.

Do you think you have what it takes
to be the mostschool-spirited student at

I Pitt? If you do,jcome to the Quad at 8

p.m. to register. ,Get crazy. Get excited.
We have tickets, compliments of the
Office of Student Affairs, for the Pitt vs.
Notre Dame Basketball game to give
away to three of the most school-spirited

people out there. The winners will be I

announced right before Homecoming
Court over at the Laser Show sponsored
by Pitt Program Council. The Pitt Band
will be in the Quad at 8:20 p.m. to escort
the crowd over to the Laser Show on
Bigelow.

We are asking for your help. This
day can only be a success if you can find
it within yourself to get decked out in
Pitt gear and come to the Quad on

Friday. If all the students on this campus Q

could participate, we could add a couple
of great new traditions to our list. So, as
students, let’s show this school that we
can exceed their expectations. We can be
more than just academically and athleti-
cally inclined. We can have more school
spirit than they ever imagined. I look
forward to seeing you all on this Friday.
Hail to Pitt! »

Think you’d notice current world atrocities? Think again

We tend to criticize previous generations’
apathy toward injustices being committed all
around them in the name of their tacit
consent.

How could they live with and tol-

erate slavery for so long without
doing anything? How could they sub-
jugate women for so long? How could
European peoples support colonial-
ism? How could the Germans sit
silently in the night while they heard
their Jewish neighbors being taken
away? .
We ask these things, and our pro-
fessors tell us, that’s just the way it
was back then. We accept this as true, _
although we don’t quite understand. Then we sit
back in our chairs and think, “If something that
horrible was that rampant nowadays, I’d know.
I’d know and I’d do something. I’d rise up
against it.”

But our internal ‘proclamation is weightless,
for we recognize that such ingrained and system-
atic injustice is a thing of the past. In this real-
ization, we are wrong.

This is a new time, and injustice has taken
new forms. Its means are harder to see now,
harder to isolate, harder to protest. But its ends
are as tragic as ever. Here is an introduction to
this injustice, a general account of the motiva-
tions and processes that bring it about.

Millions of people across Latin America and

the ‘Caribbean have been robbed of their right to.

govern themselves and their potential to prosper
— and it is largely our fault.

Their poverty is a separate issue, and the fact
that it exists cannot be blamed on any specific
institution or set of ideas. But the fact that the
these people will continue to suffer, without any
foreseeable chance of prosperity, is the fault of a
few key institutions which operate with a strin-
gent, jingoistic dogma and are powered by inter-
ests based in the United States and Europe.

 

Will Minton
Columnist

What, in essence, has occurred, is that we

have worked to enslave mi-llions of people in the .

third—world population. It’s enslave-
ment, gilded with illusions of freedom
and opportunity; it’s the slavery of the
new millennium, and here is ‘how it

works:
The perpetrators, namely the
Bretton Woods institutions — the

International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank Group, and the World
Trade Organization —— ‘wait for a
country to falter.

In the case of Bolivia, that meant
getting looted by military generals.
Much of the Caribbean found itself in
trouble after the oil crisis in the ‘70s. Bad policy
led Argentina to near crisis. The Bretton "Woods
institutions, thought to bring good will and eco-
nomic wisdom, stepped in to help.

Up to this point, everything is fine. There is
no problem with these institutions existing.
Their stated purpose is noble. They’re designed

‘to help develop struggling countries.

But when this purpose is brought in line with

_the methods used, the shining armor falls away.

They give the suffering countries money,
which is good. But then they mandate how the
money must be spent. They mandate policy deci-
sions that must be made for the flow of money to
continue.

The countries are promised that this won’t have

to go on very long, that the changes will bring

development, and soon they will be able to con-
tinue on their own. But the changes don’t bring
development. I .

Poor, not—yet—industrialized nations are
forced to open their borders to trade with major
global powers. Subsidies to local industries are
prohibited, and funding for social programs is
eliminated. The countries have to comply
because they accepted the money.

In the short term, things appear to be getting

 

Letter to the Bit

better. All of the sudden, food and clothing prod-
ucts from the United States and Europe arrive on
the market at extremely low prices. The con-
sumers feel good. The consumers don’t realize
that the money they give to buy these things goes
straight out of their country. And, since the

goods are, in fact, cheaper, local stores are dri- V

ven out of business. It becomes impossible for a
local corporation to rise to a position of wealth
and become a competitor in this game of “free
trade.”

Also, export quotas are established, so it i_s
certain that the rest of the world will enjoy what
this country has to offer: sugar cane from the
Caribbean, bananas from central America, natur-
al gas from Bolivia. The rest ,of the people, since
there are no local industries to employ them, end
up doing sewing and other grunt work for

_ transnational‘ corporations.

The countries must continue to do What they.
are told, since they cannot pay back the loans. In
the end, the people are forced to do the jobs
allowed to them —— the ones that only help for-
eign interests — take the menial wages they
make, then give them to the foreign companies
that have flooded their market. There is no
development. The poverty continues. The inden-
tured servanthas become a slave.

The pain I write of is real. Tens of thousands
protested in Honduras last week over a new IMF

accord. And, in Bolivia over the past month,

more than 60 people have died protesting their
now—resigned president’s approval of this sys-
tem.‘

But here in the nation that benefits most
from this relationship, we are safe and secure.
We sit in our classrooms, wear our Gap clothing,
drink our Bolivian coffee and wonder at how
anyone could sit so idly while injustice was hap-
pening all around them.

Homecoming glorifed pop-
ularity contest

Well, it’s that time of the year
again. Every square inch of space on
campus is covered with posters of
smiling girls and guys. Think of the
sheer amount of trash Homecoming
produces! Honestly, I’ve had enough.

Pitt is probably one of the only
schools in the nation who still choos-
es Homecoming king and queen this
way. It’s basically a popularity con-
test for the fraternities and sororities.
Even if I wanted to vote, how could
I? I don’t know anything about the
person!

The race is unfair. It’s about brib-
ing freshmen outside of Towers with
cigarettes and candy to get them to

vote. Walking into the Cathedral on
voting day means you’re going to be
attacked with ﬂiers and get the ﬁnger
if you lie and say you already voted.
It’s ridiculous.

Why can’t voting be based on
academic accomplishments and ser-
vice to the community? Maybe stu-
dents’ votes could count for 50 per-
cent of the decision, with the rest left
to a panel of community members
and faculty that judges future kings
and queens on their character. Not

. only would that put the integrity back

in the Homecoming crown, but it
would probably alleviate the annoy-
ance us regular folks would face.

Over the course of 10

Jolie’s Sarah is cold and remote in

Campbell tries tying up the plot neatly.
The focus shifts from the contrasting
of two societies to the love story of

an acceptable course for the film to
take. However, because Nick and
Sarah’s story is poorly constructed and
hard to follow, it discredits therest of

Campbell continues to distract-

closing the film in London. It’s here
where Nick ultimately finds hope,
leaving, the audience to. feel that the
reality ‘of Africa, Cambodia and

modern society that’s real. What could
have been a powerful plea for action
becomes a statement that it’s accept-

how much difference can one person

Though the acting throughout is
believable, and at moments, .the cine-

This is some epic rock

In Keeping Secrets of
Silent Earth: 3
Coheed and Cambria

7’,‘ri‘n9r

Recommended if you like: AFI

Although Coheed and Cambria
formed their sound over seven years
ago, they became known to the world
through their first official full-length
album, The Second Stage Turbine
Blade in 2000, which was an epic
adventure of music. It is a story of
roller—coaster emotion told in a cine-
matic way through hardcore guitars
and clashing drums. Their creativity
automatically set them apart from
any other rock band out there.

Their sophomore release, In

Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, is
a sequel to their first album and lives
up to its expectations and beyond. It
keeps the talent and spirit of Coheed
and Cambria alive, yet calms the
hardcore tone down just a little bit.
Growing ever more popular by word

of mouth, these New York-based S

rockers satisfy once again with their
almost-clashing of epic rock, emo,
punk and pop rhythms combined into
one great CD from start to finish.
Their latest album is full of inten-
sity, emotion-, melody and powerful
lyrics. The versatile vocals of
Claudio Sanchez add distinctiveness
to the band’s sound. Their screaming
vocals and hard guitar play are incor-
porated with so many different

One incredible album

Become the Soft.Lightes
The Incredible Moses Leroy
Ultimatum Music

sﬁnihk

Recommended if you like:
XTC, Coldplay

Even if you have never heard their
debut album, Electric Pocket Radio, you can
tell Become the Softlightes, the second
release from Ron Fountenbeny and his
band, is incredible. Why? Because
Fountenbeny is The Incredible Moses
Leroy; at least, that is what he is known as
when he picks up his guitar.

Fountenbeny didn’t choose the
moniker as a narcissistic marketing ploy.
Moses Leroy is actually the name of
Fountenbeny’s great-grandfather, a tum—of—
the—century union leader and civil rights
activist in Texas. The adjective “incredible”
was added to 've the name a_con1ic-book
feel   slip out of .
his mundane ilife a'n'd,into, the pa1,t~of thel.
“su ’
CP€até.S ‘f0? ;3II-.’¢ii1iSi~- ;'

on ”Be‘c"oni‘e* the” soﬁ.ughr¢§,._.
Leroy‘  fail to provide the f
of sinrple, music -‘that, made*popi1lar;;:

songssuch; as the playfully odd romantic‘?
tune .'  from his,‘ first album. .
Fountenberiy doesn’t create songs>‘t1_rat’:are,
overly ornate —— it’s music down to its
essential elements.

Each song builds from a simple
melody. The opening track, “Welcome to
the Soft Lights,” is a mixture of hip-hop and
Japanese koto with a soulful drone. The
tunes are airy and the rhythms upbeat From
this minimal base, Fountenbeny uses a
spectrum of instruments and sounds ranging
from xylophones, pianos and ‘80s—style syn-
thesizers, to the computer voice Veronica,

,’re’3*r'1iat‘.1jfe in the music

I Sky”

which sings, “We Don’t Dance,” to con-
struct each song. While each tune contains a
variety of sounds, Fountenberry weaves
them in so deftly that the song’s essential
basic melody is never lost.

Lyrically and thematically,
Fountenbeny follows the same rules as with
the melody — keep it simple and to the
point. No song exempliﬁes this more than
“Music Makes the Sound (of Music)” which
says precisely that. Fountenbeny uses the
song to convey that message —— music is just
that: music. The song crosses genres to mix
hip-hop rhythms with a synthesized melody.
Behind it all are native African vocals
recorded from a documentary
Fountenberry put a cassette recorder in front
of a television playing the documentary.

The innocence of the music makes
many of the songs seem like tunes dreamed
up by imaginary children. The lyrics to the
song “The Wonder Mic” are essentially the
Hokey-Pokey with a repeating four—note
progression. “Country Robot/A letter to
Dorothy” leads one to wonder if it’s possible
that the Trn Man’s heart could ever be bro-
ken or if farm life could make a robot happy. ‘

Besides Fountenbeny, the band is com-
posed of bassist and lap steel guitarist
Kristian Dunn and keyboardist Eric
Hinojosa. The album’s producer, REM and
Beck drummer Joey Waronker, joins Moses
Leroy on drums. Also appearing on the
album is Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto, who
adds her bright vocals to “The Color of

Become the Soft.Lightes doesn’t try to
be anything more than what it is -
unadomed, straightforward music done
well. Ifyou like XTC or think that Coldplay
is good but wish that their songs sounded
happier, then you might ﬁnd the Incredible
Moses Leroy, well, incredible.

Gallery

. Zoe.Beloﬁ of Scotland began her com-
puter-based artwork with a series of online
Web cam movies," in which she was the sole
performer. This medium suited her because
she was poor — and it presented an ir1ex—
pensive way to experiment with time and
story. And Beloff found the distorted images
produced by early Web cams to be appeal-

’ ing. Her first thought ——— “This is beaut:ifu .”

The short ﬁlms she created with this early
technology seemed almost to be shot from
beyond the grave. In her current exhibit,
Beloff is still concerned with time and story,
and she is still intrigued with otherworldli-
ness, but her technology has been upgraded.

The exhibit, located at the Pittsburgh
Filmmakers Melwood Gallery, _includes
two interactive CD—ROMs, “Where Where
There There Where” and “Beyond.” One of
Beloff’s motivations in creating these CD-
ROMs was an “investigation of how people
in the late 19th century thought of technolo-
gy  Before home movies, people had to

. conjure up apparitions.” Hence the image of

a seance, the central image of one work
Exploring the virtual worlds existing on
these CD-ROMS is something that Beloff

compares to going to a ﬂea market --
you’re bound to ﬁnd something you weren’t
looking for.

The third work in Be1off’s exhibit is
“The Inﬂuencing Machine of Natalija A.”
This installation is BelofI”’s interpretation of
a famous psychoanalytic case study that
took place in 1919 in Vienna. It moves
“away from the computer screen, bringing
ideas into our world.” In the piece, Beloff
reéimagines the hallucinations of Miss
Natalija A, a schizophrenic woman who
believed her mind was being controlled by
an electrical apparatus- that had been
implanted in her brain.

In “The Inﬂuencing Machine of
Natalija A,” viewers ‘adopt the role of the
German physicians who supposedly con-
trolled the apparatus, selecting a series of
images taken mostly from early TV set—ups.
The visual apparitions are accompanied by
narration and sounds of various extreme
wavelengths. Beloff found herself adopting
the persona of the schizophrenic, wonder-
ing, “what wavelengths would you hear?”
Some of those sounds she pulled from ran-
dom radio noise believed by various gov-
ernments to be spy communication. '

Beloﬁ", a 2003 Guggenheim Fellow,
has had her work shown at the Museum of
Modern Art, the New York Fihn Festival,
the Paciﬁc Film Archives and the
Pompidou Center. This exhibit advances the
opportunity for Pittsburgh audiences to
enter her unique and mysterious digital
worlds.

A malls, nightclubs, restaurants, and cafes.’

This first performance will include
a 45-minute site—speciﬁc dance theatre-
live music work about memory and
memory loss entitled “Forget Me Not,”
which explores a unique and touching
world without memory. This piece con-
templates false memory, what “truth”

strued in the mind. The Renegade Series
will also include performances. of
“Crash Lobby,” “5k Escape,” “On

- ments. “5k Escape” is a production that

includes up to 50 community members.
The work is intended to take place in a
community area, along a path or side-
«walk, where choreography includes
slow—motion, sequenced and unison-
based movements such‘ as warming up,
running and walking. “On Walking in a
Cafe After The Bath” explores love and

sounds that it’s hard to classify this
band under any sort of specific rock
genre.

The album opens with “In
Keeping Secrets Of Silent Earth: 3,”
which is a dramatic punch. Just listen
at the first lines, “A broad incision
sits across the evening/A victim to
our fathers’ lost war/The restless
children sit and mourn the graves/Of
those they’ve never seen before/Will
they be buried here among the dead?

In the silent secret.” It’s the perfect

set—up to what the rest of the album.

will feel like.

Another noteworthy track on the
album is “Blood Red Summer,” a
poppy standout to their. otherwise
epic—hardcore sound. Thisiwsong is the
band’s wou1d—.be mainstreaim hit; it
has a catchy beat with allittle Jimmy
Eat World ﬂavor to it.

Included with this CD is a DVD

that has the space—inﬂuenced video.

for “Devil in Jersey City,” including
a hilarious alternate video of some

southern imitators trying hard to cap-
ture the Coheed and Cambria stage
presence. Also included is a three-

minute documentary by Dragging the - 1

Lake video magazine and a live video
for “Delirium Trigger.”

Overall, this CD is a little more 0

mainstream and less aggressive than
any of the other band’s attempts, but
it’s unlike any sort of rock that you
will find out there. Full of creativity

and ﬂavor, it’s a must—have for any "

Coheed or rock fan. '

Sophomore forward Keeyan Young attempts to switch directions and attack the ball as his opponent heads downfield in a

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Pitt and West Virginia‘ scored
three goals apiece in regulation at
the Mountaineer Soccer Complex
Tuesday night, but shut each other
out in the two overtime periods to

finish in a 3-3 tie, with the Panthers

blowing a two-goal lead.

Freshman midfielder Thomas
DeCato. jump-started the Panthers’
offense with his first career goal. He
would later make the most of this
career day by scoring his second
goal as well. A A  .

DeCato’s first goal came when
he controlled the ball off a rebound
that Mountaineer goalkeeper Nick
Noble could not hold on to. DeCato
fired the ball .past Noble from 18
yards out to put the Panthers up 1-0
just 4:56 into the game.

The second DeCato goal came in
the second half when he took a pass
from forward Keeyan Young and
shot the ball from 15 yards out,
beating Noble to put the Panthers up
3-1. .

Despite having the 3-1 lead, the

Panthers, for the third time this sea-
son, allowed a lead to getaway. .-
Mountaineer forward Jarrod
Smith accepted a pass from mid-
fielder Cole Beasley, and shot the
ball past Panther goalkeeper Justin

-Lowery. The goal came at 70:03 and

cut Pitt’s lead to one.

Just two minutes later, the
Mountaineers struck again, when
midfielder Devon McTavish tied the

game at three on a shot from 10'

yards out. The goal was his second
of the game, and his fifth goal of the
season. '

The goal came at the 72:46, with

midfielder Albert Smith assisting on -
the play.

McTavish’s first goal was scored
in the first half at 28:07. The play
was set up when Rusty Girton
passed a kick from 40 yards out to

,McTavish. McTavish used his head

to deﬂect Girton’s pass into the net
past Lowery. ’ ‘

I Panther midfielder Brendon
Smith scored the. other Pitt goal of
the day. It was an unassisted tally at
50:22 when he headed a ball that

deﬂected off the post, past Noble, .

. game earlier this season. Young and the Panthers ended their game with West Virginia in a 3-3 tie.

  Pitt and WVU end in 3-3 tie

putting Pitt ahead 2-1.

’ In the two overtime periods, the
teams combined for 10 shots; Pitt
with four, and West Virginia with
six.
The Panthers forced Noble to
make two saves in the overtime
period, but they were unable to beat
him for the game winner.

This was Pitt’s second double
overtime game in the past three
games. Young notched the game
winner in the last overtime game,
but only managed a single shot on

‘ goal in the game.

A A The latter part of the game fea-
tured a lot of physical play between
both teams, _and the bitter rivalry
between Pitt and West Virginia was
alive. From the 62nd minute on,
there were six yellow cards and
three red cards. ‘

Young, who has six goals and
two assists this season, was the lone
Panther who received a red card,
and that means Pitt will play its next
game without their leading scorer.

Pitt’s next game is against Ohio
State at 7 p.m. on Oct. 24 at
Founders Field. .

 

Cubs and  

‘ Red Sox
miss World
Series
 saws

  

Around midnight last Thursday,
I looked down into my half-empty
— or half—full if you’re one of those
optimistic people — beverage and
felt an overwhelming sadness wash
over me.

Yeah, I was disappointed that I
had already drank most of my drink.
But what had really made me sad
was that the baseball season had
come to an end.

Over the years,. my interest in
baseball has waned thanks to a num-
ber of things. Although the players
and owners have tried their best to
run the sport into the ground, I con-
tinued to care, because baseball is a
great sport.

Before anyone gets upset by that
statement, what I mean is, as far as
tradition and legacy go, nothing can
match that of Major League
Baseball.

Normally, when the playoffs roll
around, I lose interest and focus my
attention on football. Maybe I’ll
watch a game or two of the World
Series, but that’s probably because
there is nothing else on.

But this year was different, with
both the Chicago Cubs and the
Boston Red Sox in the chase. In the
playoffs, in the same year, it just
seemed destined that they would
meet in the World Series.

But it wasn’t to be. Say it was
because of a curse or because nei-

A ther team was good enough. No mat-

ter what the reason, the perfect fall
classic didn’t pan out.

Which is why the season’ might
as well be over.

Pitt cross country competes at Duquesne Invitational

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

Despite having three of her team-
mates out with injuries, junior Lauren
Shaffer led the Pitt women’s cross
country team through a muddy course
to a second—p1ace finish in the
Duquesne Invitational on Friday.

“We’re missing [runners] one,
three and five,” coach Waddie
Freeman said at the onset of the race.
“But sometimes that happens. You’ve
got to step it up.”

Shaffer ﬁnished first in the 5—kilo-
meter race, with a time of 18 minutes,
22 seconds.

In the men’s race, Pitt captured
third place out of eight teams in its last

meet before the Big East
Championships, a 5—mile ’ course
through Schenley Park.

Pitt women finish second out of eight
teams

At the 2K marker, Pitt held strong
positions.
“One through four are solid,”

Freeman said. “[But] No. 5, [Katelyn
Fleishman], is a little shaky.” . 

Fleishman said that she; felt
encouraged to step up because of the
absence of her team’s injuredrunners
but had trouble keeping her footing on
the wet ground. She fell on the
course’s first hill.

Most -noticeably omitted from the

race was junior Maureen McCandless,

who, in her sophomore season, became
the first Panther to ever qualify for the
NCAA Championships. S
McCandless, out with a knee
injury, said that she will be able to run

in the Big East Championships on Oct. I

31. A
Sophomore Abby Zaylor, who
missed the race with an injury to the
side of her foot, said that she would
also be ready to run in the tournament.

In the race, Nicola Angstadt
moved ahead of fellow Panther, seiiior
Rachel Rothe, with a strong finish to

.take sixth place overall and second for

Pitt.

“This is by far Nikki’s [Angstadt]
best race,” Freeman said as Angstadt
sped around the ﬁnal turn in a field full

of fall’s soaked foliage.

With a final‘ score of 63, the
women’s team finished [32 points
behind the hosting Duquesne, but 11

’ points ahead of their next closest com-

petitor, Lehigh.
Pitt men finish third of eight teams
“I like our freshmens’ strategy,”

Freeman said at the beginning of the
race. “They’re getting right to the top.”

For the fourth straight race, Pitt

had more freshmen than upperclass-
men in its scoring top ﬁve. 
“This group of freshmen, they’ve

i got a lot of heart,” Freemansaid.

Senior Mike Diano placed fourth

among the Panthers and 16th overall.

Surrounding him on Pitt’s scorecard
were four freshmen: Eric Fleming,
fifth overall; Andy Tomaswick, eighth;
Jesse Mang, 13th; and Stephen
Gonzalez, ‘20th.

The Panthers held top spots early
on, but standout runners from other
schools sprung out late in the race.

“The guy_ from Duquesne [Ryan
Bender] made’ a move. Iexpected

that,” Freeman said. “He tried to break
them on the hills.” ‘

Fleming and Tomaswick cooperat-
ed to stem the tide of surging runners
and grab the top—ten finishes.

“The Duquesne and Lehigh guys
made a move on us,” Fleming said.

“[But] we worked together to pull it‘

back. We were talking. The hills
weren’t that tough.”

. Pitt finished with 62 points, behind
Lehigh and Duquesne, who took first
and second places respectively.

After the meet, Fleming echoed a
comment made earlier in -the season by
his teammate Michael Long. A

On Sept. 6, Long said, “On any
given day, anyone ican pretty much do
anything. Today just happened to be’
my day,” after finishing first among
the Panthers at the Duquesne Duals
Invitational. .

“Today was just my day,” Fleming
said.

“Our team’s going to make a big
showing [at ‘ the - Big East
Championships] and surprise a lot of
people. This is just the beginning of
the season,” he said.

THE PITT NEWS

Steelers will welcome back the Bus at running back against Rams

Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill
Cowher is jumping back on the Bus.
This Sunday, when the Steelers
take on the Rams, Jerome Bettis will

' be making his first start of the sea-

son. Bettis, who is the National
Football League’s tenth all-time
leading rusher, is off to the worst
start of his career, averaging 2.9
yards per carry.

Despite a 2-4 start, the Steelers
are only one game out of first place
in the AFC North division, thanks to
losses over the weekend by‘ both

-Cleveland and Baltimore. Coach

Cowher said that, with the offensive
line struggling, Bettis’ power run-
ning style is just “more conducive.”
As of now, the Steelers are
ranked 28th in total rushing. That is
alarming when you consider the fac-t
that, since the NFL merger in 1970,
the team has never finished ranked
lower than 18th in team rushing.
Although Bettis has suffered a

I drop—off in production over the past
‘two seasons, it’s hard to. argue with
—Cowher’s decision, to start the Bus

this Sunday.

It may not be pretty; in fact, at
times it’s downright ugly, but when
you need to grind out a few yards, it
takes a strong running back. like

Bettis to plow through the line and

7 move the ball. Bettis is known for

being able to run though holes that
aren’t there and bang out three or
four yards in a cloud of dust.

' That is just what the Steelers
need most right now.

If the Steelers are going to turn
this season around, it will take a
great deal of improvement in all
facets of the game, but it all starts
with the running game.

The lack of production in the
ground game has led to quarterback

Tommy Maddox facing an enormous f

amount of "pressure from opposing
defenses. The Steelers are currently
ranked eighth in passing, but pres-
sure on Maddox has led to some key
mistakes that have cost the Steelers
somegames.

Maddox is definitely not a
mobile quarterback, therefore he

needs time to set up in the pocket,
make his reads and get the ball off.

This is the Steel City.
Pittsburghers expect their football
team to play great defense and run
the ball down the throat of the oppo-
sition. Fans came into this season
both intrigued and excited by the
new offensive strategy, but so far
have to be disappointed by the way
things have turned out.

You cannot expect to be able to
pass the ball effectively without
some type of running game. Teams
have figured out that pressuring

‘Maddox is the key to stopping the

Steelers. It takes a balanced offen-
sive attack to be consistent.

I personally look forward to see-
ing the Bus step back in as the
starter. It could serve as a morale
boost for the team. After all, Bettis
has been the man for the Steelers
since being acquired in a trade with
St. Louis in 1996. He’s battled
through a number of injuries and
still has the desire to play. The guys
in the huddle can see that; they all
know what he’s been through, and
they all know how much heart he
has. i

We are talking about a 31-year-
old power running back who is in

his 11th season. That is unheard of.
Earl Campbell, the Houston Oilers
great power runner of the late ‘70s
and early ‘80s, managed to play
eight seasons in the NFL.

Bettis sat down in an interview
and watched a video that illustrated
the pain Campbell suffers each day
just to get out of bed in the morning.
After watching the video, the 256-

‘pound running back was visibly

shaken. As he fought to hold back
tears, Bettis looked directly into the
camera and said that he had to keep
playing.

That was all I needed to hear.

You may not be a Steelers fan,
you might not even like football, but
you have to respect a man who loves
his sport enough to lay it all on the
line like that. Bettis has worked
harder than ever before to get back
on the field for the Steelers this sea-
son. Although his .1,000-yard sea-
sons are now only a memory, Bettis
deserves respect and admiration for
his love of the game.

tournaments, two places the Panthers
haven’t been since 1994.

“Lindsey is about leadership, confi-
dence and a winner’s mentality. She just
gets’ good players to play better,” head
coach Chris Beerman said. “She brings out
the best in her teammates. Sometimes she
is an antagonist, but everyone knows she is

all about winning.”

She attended high school at Notre
Dame Academy in Kentucky, where
she helped her team to four consecu-
tive district and regional champi-

onships. -Macke’s team twice finished

sophomore and senior seasons.

Now, in her first year as a starter at
Pitt,- the Panthers are off to their best
start in years, with a record of 16-3,

- including winning their last ten match-
es in a row. Even though her team-
leading 13.58 assists per gameare piv-
otal, Macke understands that you win
and loseas a team.

‘‘It’s really a team effort, if you
look at our stats. Everyone is con-
tributirig; there is no star player. We
have a lot of outlets, and we have a
great bench, too.” -

Off the court, Macke has a confi-
dent, fun-loving personality that has
earned her friendships and respect
from both coaches and teammates.

“Off the court, she is a great per-
son. She is very funny and she is
always willing to help you if you ever
get in trouble,”
McGrane, the Panthers starting libero.
“Lindsey has always been there for me,
and I. know she always will be.”

- Macke doesn’t have to worry about
throwing touchdowns or interceptions,
bu't Beerman says she is their team’s
quarterback and she handles the pres-
sure like a professional. ,

“Macke is a real confident person.
She almost has a strut. She is like our
quarterback,” Beerman said. “You

~ don’t want your quarterback to lack
leadership or charisma. When I think
about her off the court, I think confi-
dencef’ _ ' ‘L

Although Macke is only a junior
and has one more season after this one
with the Panthers, she has already
started to consider her future in the
business world. Lindsey would like to
attend graduate school but most likely
it will be back home in Kentucky. Her
main interests lie in marketing and
travel. A

ball, she spends a lot of time trying to
keep her grades up, which is some-
thing she also stressed in high school.
At Notre Dame Academy, she was

named a" ‘‘Who’s Who among High‘

School Students,” was part of the
National Honor society and was on
the honor roll.

Macke’s parents attend as many
games as possible, driving in on the
weekends to catch the matches at the
Fitzgerald Field House. Even though
she does miss home,‘her._decision to
come to Pitt wasn’t ‘very difficult.
One of the many things that drew her

to Pitt from Kentucky was that the

campus is part of a_ big city, and with
a big city comes plenty of opportuni-
ties to keep busy. V

“Kentucky is a great state; I love
it, but I do love this campus. I love
being near"the city and always having
something to do.” _

On the court, Macke and the
Panthers are in search of their first
Big East tournament championship in

almost a decade and a trip back to the
NCAA tournament as well. The
Panthers are just getting into the
thick of their Big East schedule with
matches against Virginia Tech on
Oct. 31 and Miami on Nov. 2 on the
road. They will end the regular sea-
son against the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame on Nov. 16 at the
Fitzgerald Field House. .

Macke hopes that the success of
the team combined with the quality
of opponents coming to Pitt to play

‘the Panthers will increase the atten-

dance at games, something that she
personally feeds off of.
“[Attendance] has been a lot bet-
ter here at Pitt than before. The
crowd has a big part to do with how
intense you are during the game.” V

Ultimately, it makes no differ- -

ence to Macke how many seats are
filled come game day. The only thing
she is concerned with, once she puts
her uniform on, is supporting her
teammates, building their confidence
and ending the match the only way
she knows how — as a winner.

Yankees will win World Series

Madness, page 17

Why would anyone outside of,

Miami and New York want to
watch‘?

Why would anyone want to
watch period? The outcome is cer-
tain — the Yankees are going to’ win.

As much as I hate to say it, New

‘York will win the series, whether it

is in five games or seven games. No
matter how hard you deny it, you’ve
known that since the beginning of
the season.

And that’s what is wrong with
baseball.

In no other sport can a team buy
championships the way they can in
baseball.

Sure, the Detroit Red Wings won
a Stanley Cup .two years ago with a
Hall of Fame lineup that they
bought, but spending lots; of money
doesn’t always result in a champi-
onship in hockey. Just-ask the New
York Rangers. ' ‘

With salary caps in basketball
and football, it’s impossible to buy a
title. .
The Florida Marlins were the
first team to do it in baseball, which
makes "it kind of interesting that
they’re facing the Yankees._

At the beginning of the year, no
one would have guessed‘ that the
Marlins would be there. Everyone
could have predicted that New York
would be there.

The Yankees are a dynasty, but
are-nothing like any sports dynasty

before them.

Of the nine position players who
started on New York’s first World
Series team of 1996, only Derek
J eter and Bernie'Wil1iams remain. In
fact, more than half of the Yankees
starting lineup has changed ‘since
New York advanced to the fall clas-
sic in 2001.

That’s not a real dynasty. A.

dynasty is the team that keeps the
same care of players year in and
year out, filling any holes only when

they come up. Buying two new out-

fielders and a first and third base-
man every year and a half and
expecting to win is not, ,
On the other side, perhaps the
Marlins will become a dynasty of

their own. There is the core of play- —

ers —— Luis Castillo, Juan Pierre and
Miguel Cabrera ——- and Florida
added the veterans it needed in Ivan
Rodriguez and» Jeff Conine to make
the playoff push. But judging" by the

current ‘financial situation in base- 

ball, it’s not likely. 
It would have been great to se

Chicago and Boston in the World

Series. It_would be great to see

Florida win the team’s second cham- ‘

pionship.

But it won’t happen. In today’s
baseball world, money talks and the
emperor wears blue pinstripes.

study is investigating how well a commonly used
