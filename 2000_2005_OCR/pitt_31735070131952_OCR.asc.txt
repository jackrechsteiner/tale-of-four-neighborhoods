as thousands of tlashbulbs went off in the
sea of Florida Marlins fans.

And almost nobody is in the living
room to witness it.

Sure, Jimi is watching, but he’s just

procrastinating from doing school work.

' Sprawled out on the couch. he mumbles at

some point: "I need a vacation.”

lt’s probably safe to say Jimi isn’t the
only one who wants a vacation. On this
frigid October Pittsburgh night, almost
nobody is outside. Maybe the menacing
hands of Jack Frost are frightening people.
keeping them from leaving their warm
rooms. or maybe the dreaded “midterm
season" is finally taking its toll.

Whatever the case. the boys of Bouquet
are not exempt.

Besides work, are the guys busy trying
to keep up appearances, with “The Real
Pitt” in mind‘? A sign on the refrigerator in
the apartment reads. “Reality: The leading
cause of stress.”

“That’s why there’s ‘The Family

While Jimi procrastinates. Aaron and
Chad are working on lab reports and Bob is
busy studying for an anatomy test.

“This is my week from Hell,” says

Aaron. listing the assignments he has due

Meanwhile. Chad’s cooked some oat-
meal and brewed a mug of warm tea. Brain

“l-lorrible." says Chad, taking a bite of
his oatmeal and rising to clean his dishes.

Homecoming is changing. I

In past years, there were few signs on campus
that it was supposed to be a special weekend. There
were the masses of students handing out random
things like candy, condoms and lighters, and people
dressed up in strange costumes outside the
Litchfield Towers — anything to get people to vote
for their Homecoming King and Queen candidates.

For the most part, that was it.

This year, though, things are different.

Students are still giving out random things near
the Towers to get last-minute votes for their
Homecoming nominees,- but with the Student
Government Board’s help, this Won’t be the only
sign of Homecoming around campus.

one involved in the festivities and to “generate a
certain spirit” on campus. One of the easiest ways
students canshow their Pitt-pride is by dressing in
blue and gold, she said. _ ‘
According to Mike Kelly,,who worked on pro-
moting SGB’s Homecoming events, “Pitt’s always
criticized for not having school spirit.” ,
Culliton added that, most of the time, students
are separated into different groups, and that she

hoped this would bring all students together. To .

help achieve that, the Board members have many
events planned for today. .
‘ Activities are planned to kick off at noon with a

banner competition in the Schenley Quad. As of '

Thursday, about 20 to 25 groups had signed up to
create the three-b_y-five feet banners. According to
Culliton, not only will this let students show off

Last year, a single booth in the

I Litchfield Towers lobby provided the
only place for Pitt students to _vote for I

Homecoming King and Queen.

This year, the number of voting
stations has been increased from one
to several thousand. _

Students can now vote . for

. Homecoming candidates on any

computer with an ‘Internet connec-

tion at the ’Web ‘site "my.pitt.edu, '

thanks to changes made by the Blue
and Gold Society and Omicron Delta
Kappa. -

The two groups are sponsoring

Homecoming this year.

By logging into my.pitt.edu, stu-

 dents can scroll ‘through pictures of

the Homecoming’ candidates and

T read their short essays about what

gives them the most Pitt Pride.

The essays area new feature this
year, according to Peter Stopp, presi-
dent of the Blue and Gold Society.
Stopp added that the statements
make Homecoming less of a beauty
contest and more about pride in the
University.

Voting began Thursday at noon
and will end at noon today, giving
students 24 hours to log in and place
their votes, instead of just six hours,
like last year.

But candidates are concerned
that not all Pitt-—students-will make
use of the Web site.

“I don’t use that Web site and
don’t know many people that do, sol
expect voter turnout to be low this

 

Students log on to vote

year,” said Anna Schenker, a candi-
date for Homecoming Queen who
was campaigning Thursday.

‘ Determined to encourage stu-

dents to vote, Schenker and other '

candidates handed out small ﬂyers
with instructions on show to log onto
the Web site and cast their ballots.

Along with the ﬂyers, some can- '
didates passed out candy as small"

bribes. In years past, a candidate

reportedly handed out cigarettes, for_ _'

the Same reason. . _ ._

Jill Albrecht, presidentwof  i

said that handing ‘out cigarettes is
strictly prohibited by the rules that
the candidatesmust follow. _, .
Albrecht added that, if someone
handed out cigarettes, there would be
a hearing to review the act and deter-
mine disciplinary action. ODK has

been running Homecoming and

making the rules for it since the mid-

l990s, but thisrvyear, they shared the '
responsibilities with the Blue ’ and .
_ Gold Society for the first time. A

Albrecht said that the decision to
share the job with Blue and Gold was
made because, “last year, .we started
to feel that we weren’t the right orga-
nization to do Homecoming, because
we are an organization centered on
leadership.” - ’

Although Albrecht is president
of a leadership organization, she does
not think that changing the voting to
place more value on leadership is
necessarily a good idea.

“If we changed it to something V
like that, then it would just be a fall

ed in a quarterly ‘online alumni
newsletter that, he said, reaches more
than 60,000 Pitt graduates.

.He added that, apart from all the
events planned around Homecoming,
this weekend will provide a valuable

opportunity for alumni to reconneé .

with their alma mater.

“This weekend’s events encour-
age alumni to become more involved
in what is happening here at the
University,” said Patouillet. “That
ties in to the’Alumni Association,
because our job is to act as a kind of
gigantic conduit between [Pitt]_and
the alumni body.”

According to Patouillet, many of
the visiting alumni will travel in
groups, clustered by various.Pitt

alumni clubs from around the country,

and overseas, fraternities, athletic
and academic groups, and former
neighbors and classmates.

“Lots of self—identifying groups
of alumni will come together,” said
Patouillet. “But what we do is pro-
vide an opportunity to package it all
and provide some economics of
scale.” A

Ridley remembered as leader,

ERIC SAPORITO
Staff Writer

A Navy veteran, a former Port
Authority Transit bus driver and an
employee of several nonprofit agen-
cies in the area, Todd J. Ridley was a
Pitt student leader when he died.

The death of Ridley, Pitt’s
College of General Studies Student
Government president, on Oct. 16,
shocked his many friends on and off
campus. Ridley’s spirit of communi-

ty involvement amazed his class— --

mates and advisers.

Ridley had no doubts for his
future — he wanted to help people
achieve their dreams. His friends
agreed that his love of life was dri-
ving his dreams for success.

Ridley was the first CGS Student
Government president to occupy a
new office in the McCarl Center for
Non—Traditional Students on the
fourth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning. ‘ ’

Ridley, was inaugurated in the
position in March of 2003. He
encouraged people to get involved
and give back to the —
community, here at
Pitt and in their neigh-
borhoods. -

“Todd vvds the

friend and community activist

intern with the Hazelwood Initiative.

The COPC programs are a part-.
nership initiative of 5 the US.
Housing and Urban Development
and the Office of University
Partnerships. The COPC programs
encourage higher education institu-
tions to use their resources to help
the rebuilding of neighboring com-
munities, according to the COPC
Web site. »

“Todd was committed to getting
students involved, and he practiced
what he preached,” said Tracy Soska,
co—director of COPC from the School
of Social Work, as well as Ridley’s_
faculty mentor. '

‘The COPC program enabled
Ridley to intern with the Hazelwood
Initiative, where he helped to coordi-
nate the 5K race, a tour of

Hazelwood, and "many other activi-.
.ties sponsored by the initiative.

Ridley just finished a housing devel-

opment course to help future home— _

owners navigate the maze of mort-
gage lending services. He was in the
process of starting a neighborhood

newspaper to highlight the
Hazelwood area. '

“Todd was the‘
most positive person,
encouraging everyone
to get involved,” said
Joyce Giangarlo, CGS
Student Government
adviser. I

Ridley was going
to be a newly inducted member of
Alpha Sigma Lambda, the CGS
Honors Society. '

“He was a positive role model
for African—American males,” said
Benita Johnson, one of Ridley’s
classmates and an Alpha Sigma
Lambda member.

«Johnson added that she hopes
Ridley’s friends take the things that
they admired about him and include
them in their lives —— and that they
give back to their community.

A senior in Public
Administration, Ridley wanted to
make less afﬂuent neighborhoods
better places to live for residents. He
participated in the Community

their. school spirit, but it will also
give students a creative outlet that
they do not always get at Pitt.

She anticipates seeing “a mas-
sive sea of [people dressed in] blue
and gold, who are hurryingto get
the banners done” by 3:30 p.m.

After the banner making winds
down,_ SGB will be handing out
2,500 pom—poms to students wear-
ing blue and gold in the Quad.

Culliton and others involved
with SGB will be judging the ban-

'ners~ between 5:30 and 6 p.m.

Though they will have a score
sheet, it’s supposed to be fun,
Culliton said. After the competi-
tion, the banners will be hung in the
William Pitt Union.

After that, SGB will host the
Panther Cheer Station.
Cheerleaders will be in the Quad,
teaching interested students new
and old Pitt cheers. According to
Culliton, the Panther may also
make an appearance.

SGB will also host a “Who has
the most school spirit?” contest at 8
p.m.

“Get crazy,” Culliton said. “It’ll.

be fun.”

Though she doesn’t know what
to expect, she hopes people get into
the event by doing things like paint-
ing themselves in school colors.

At about 8:15 p.m., the Pitt Pep
Band will perform and march to
Bigelow Boulevard, where the
day’s winners will. be announced.
The day’s festivities will culminate
with the Pitt Program Council’s
annual fireworks show at the
Cathedral of Learning’. .

Through the day’s events, SGB
wants to rekindle some of the
school spirit that existed oncampus
in the past, Culliton said, Years ago,
Homecoming included a parade and
other festivities, she said. By start-
ing something this year, she hopes
to create a base for Pitt to start new
traditions in upcoming years.

“Hopefully, we can rekindle the.

pride,” she said.

Hard partying takes a rest for hard work

Bouquet, page‘ 2

“All right, I gotta go do this lab.”

According to Chad, the guys aren’t
always engulfed in work; they know
how to party as well.

“When we party, we party hard.
When we work, we work hard,” he
says. I

Moments later, Aaron emerges
from his room, frustrated. Apparently,
he’s not faring too well with his home-
work.

“I was about this close to throwing
my computer out the window,” Aaron
says, holding his right thumb and index
ﬁnger about an inch apart. 1

Shortly thereafter, Bob enters, visi-
bly tired, obviously from ,the toils of
studying anatomy.

“How’s the studying going?” Chad
asks. .

“Oh, it’s still going,” Bob says
with a sigh.

None of the guys seem like they
want to do work. Jimi’s given up and
has retreated to the confines of his
room. The other three guys head down
the hall, toward their rooms, following

_ Jimi’s lead —‘—— maybe to study, maybe

to sleep. V
_ They chat in the hall for a few
moments about Chemistry and

Engineering, but the conversation soon
becomes one in which memories of
past shenanigans are brought to light.
“Remember that time we stole 25
cases of student -directories from the
Sutherland Hall lobby our freshman
year?” someone asks. _
' “Oh, man, that was classic,” retorts
someone else. “It took us weeks to

throw those away without gettingi
. caught.”

“And remember ‘Psycho Witch,’.

_ that crazy girl that liked JiIni?” Bob

asks.

“That girl drove me nuts!”
exclaims Chad. “I remember the time
she fell out of J irr1i’s top bunk and land-
edface-first on the ﬂoor.”

As the night fades on, the guys
reminisce about more antics, inside

’ jokes 1. and insane people they knew.

Sure, the conversation may not be
exciting to an outsider, and sure, it may
be childish, but for these guys, it’s a
fun way toforget about lab reports and
anatomy tests.
And it’s‘a way to forget reality.

Candidates worry students Won’t vote online

Election, page 2

semester version of Senior of the Year.
We already have awards that recognize
leadership at Pitt,” she said.

Homecoming seems to many like lit-
tle more than a beauty contest, thus draw-
ing criticism from students who would
like to see the contest oriented more
toward merit.

“If they’re going to be recognized by
our University, then it should be more
than a popularity contest,” said Rachel
Buxbaum, a junior majoring in psycholo-
gy, when asked about potential changes
to the voting system.

While some students are particularly

excited about Homecoming because
someone they know is running, many
more take an apathetic view of this Pitt
tradition.

“I might vote; I might not. I don’t
really care one way or the other,” said
freshman business major Pat Jones. “If I
vote, I’m just going to go by looks for the
girls and pick a guy at random.”

After analyzing pictures of the candi-
dates for Homecoming Queen for a solid
minute, Jones determined that his vote
would go to Sarah Burroughs. _

Other freshmen were confused about
the idea of Homecoming elections at a
University with almost 18,000 students.

“Isn’t Homecoming a high school

thing?” asked Nate Forman, a freshman
history major. “It made sense in high
school, because we knew the people that
were running, but here I don’t know any
of them.”

But according to Stopp and Albrecht,
in’ a school without many traditions,
Homecoming could be a way to increase '
school spirit and to help the alumni who
make the pilgrimage back to campus
remember their days as students.

If the alumni are anything like
today’s Pitt students, then, at the .very
least, they should remember making a
shot—in-the-dark vote for Homecoming
King and Queen — and enjoying free
candy. ~

Don’t get confused;
these new towels

are far from terrible
Panther, page 2

Frank, Brennan and their friends won-
dered why Pitt didn’t have a similar spirit
organization for football.

Scott Morley and Peter Stopp ran for
Student Government Board on the platform
of increasing community and traditions at
Pitt, especially regarding‘ athletics. Frank
heard their campaign ideas and got them
involved with the formation of the club.

“We just reallyjpointed [Frank] in the
direction of the right people,” said Stopp,
who is now on the Board.

' Frank contacted the athletics depart-
ment, Team Pittsburgh and the Alumni
Association to share her ideas about a foot-
ball booster organization. According to

‘Frank, the athletics department voluntwred

to give The Panther Pitt ftmding for T-shirts
from Aeropostale. However, they realized
the October weather may be too cold for T-
shirts and switched to towels instead.

. Franks admitted she was hesitant at ﬁrst
because “we don’t want people bringing
their Terrible Towels and thinking we are the
Steelers.”

However, the towels are being given
away and are being sold in all places selling
Pitt merchandise, according to Brennan.

“We don’t want the towels to be just
something that people get at the game and

. say ‘Oh, look, I got a towel’ and then not

bring them anymore,” she said. “We want
them to bring them to every game.” .

With the emergence of the Oakland
Zoo for basketball, one may question why a

football organization never existed previ-

ously.

Chris Ferris, athletics department
administrator and The Panther Pitt adviser,
said the idea for a booster club for the foot-
ball team was not foreign to the department.
The founders of the Panther Pitt stood out
because they “had a great concept,” Fenis
said. '

Vote Butter for Homecoming King

Homecoming a time to
remember Pitt traditions; a time to
honor the blue and gold; a time to
pick our most beautiful, put sparkly
hats on them and stick them on a
boat. Also, there’s tailgating.

But aside from the beer and
fried chicken, the Homecoming
King and Queen are the tastiest
parts of the weekend.

And you should vote for them
and vote now —— polls close at noon
today. Unlike past years, voting this
year is done online at
www.my.pitt.edu. Just log in, look
for the Homecoming election sub-
heading and scroll through your list
of options. Each candidate is listed
with his or her picture, and a link to
an essay about Pitt pride. So, rather
than being the vapid beauty contest
it usually is, it’s now a beauty con-
test with essays. ‘

This form of voting is a boon to
the election — it allows for 24
hours of polling, rather than the
meager six provided last year. Also,

you don’t have to be in Towers‘

Lobby to vote. This way, anyone
with Internet access can vote,
which will hopefully lead to a high-
er turnout this year than in years
past.

Reducing overt bribery —— buy-
ing votes with candy and other
commodities — is another benefit

of on—line voting, though we will
miss the tiny chocolate bars. And
this form of polling will hopefully
eliminate an unfortunate Pitt tradi-

tion: littering the Ashtray with

fliers, candy’ wrappers and junk,
leaving it to the custodians and
groundskeepers to clean.

Many complain that Pitt doesn’t

have many Homecoming traditions, '

apart from indiscriminate waste,
but there is a new one that we hope
to perpetuate electing a

Homecoming King and Queen rep-"

resentative of Pitt as a whole. While
the Greek system is important to
Pitt, only 13 percent of Pitt is
Greek. As such, whoever is elected
should represent more than that 13
percent.

We, at The Pitt News, are never
ones to be silent. And, to be honest,
we aren’t unbiased observers of this
election. We are sponsoring a can-
didate, and la nontraditional one at
that.

Brian “Butter” Palmer writes
for our A&E section, works for
WPTS radio station and is spon-
sored by the Oakland Zoo, in addi-
tion to the station and this newspa-
per. He deserves your vote, because
as his Web site says, “he’s bigger
than you.” And we couldn’t have
put it better. So vote for Butter.
He’ll look great in a sparkly hat.

God on our side: Boykin’s imagined war on Satan absurd

. “But now we got weapons/Of the chemical dust/If fire
them we’re forced to/Then ﬁre them we must/One push of
the button/And a shot the world wide/And you never ask
questions/When God’s on your side,” sang Bob Dylan on his
1964 record The Times TheyAre A-Changin’. Dylan penned
that line back in 1964, in reference to the Cold
War, but, had he just written “VV1th God On
Our Side” yesterday, his social commentary
could easily be extended to the war on terror.

Perhaps as an unintentional tribute to the
great singer/songwriter, the Bush
Administration and the Pentagon recently
helped f|.1I'l’hCI' the timelessness of Dylan’s
words by appointing Lt Gen. William Boykin
in charge of hunting Osarna bin Laden and
Saddam Hussein. - *

Many see Boykin — in his personal life
-- as one step short of a priest; a man so
Christian that bibles must fall out of his pock-
ets when he walks around. Unfortunately, Boykin’s faith
does not get checked at his army barracks door, as his mili-
tary history frequently has him publicly describing the war
on terror as one of a purely religious nature.

Sadly, Boykin’s elevation to terror search dog is consis-
tent with the Bush Administration’s “act ﬁrst, think later”
policy. Clearly someone should have foreseen a problem
arising from granting a Boykin an even larger soapbox on
which to publicly initiate a shouting match of ideals against
his own Commander in Chief. But, like those mysteriously

invisible weapons of mass destruction, rational thought

seems to also be undetectable.
According to remarks documented in a recent Los
Angeles Times article, Boykin’s views on God and tenor

    

David J McCarthy
Colurrmist

make him seem oblivious at best, ﬂat-out extremist at worst.
The quote—brigade begins with, in a speech on radical Islamic
views, Boykin declaring that the U.S.’s “enemy is a guy
named Satan.” Satan, you say. Hrnm. I’m wondering if we
have it in our budget to take on ol’ Lucifer in addition to 01’
bin Laden and Hussein. Do we even have
enough troops to attack the third front of
Hades? I’d sayour odds are about a snowball’s
chance in ... well, you get the idea
Sure, an argument could easily be made
that Boykin was merely taking a few harmless
liberties in comparing our enemies to the Devil.
But consider a quote he made in reference to a
Muslim soldier in Somalia; “I knew my God
was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a
real god, andhis was an idol.”
Wow. Are there a million things wrong
with that statement? Let’s start with its sheer
. arrogance. Mr. Boykin, why don’t you just
replace the word “God” with “penis” and say that one more
time. Also, anyone who’s read even the C1iff’s Notes on
Islam would know that the Muslim God and the Christian
God are the same deity. But I guess those facts are merely
trivial to Mr. Boykin, who, at home, probably has his “Jesus
and Pals” action ﬁgures positioned in battle stances against
their evil, plastic Muslim counterparts.
Extending his commentary to that beyond his assigned
military role, Boykin found it necessary to clarify that his
Commander in Chief is in the White House because “God

. put him there.” Golly, Mr. Boykin sure does seem to know a

lot about what the ‘Man Upstairs’ intends. Can you answer
me this, Mr. Boykin? Why do bad things happen to good
people?

All joking aside, Boykin’s comments are downright
scary and couldn’t have come at a worse time. By no means
do I mean to imply that being openly religious is a bad thing,
but when someone is in the position to speak on behalf of the
U.S. armed forces, a little bit of non—denominational judg-
ment must be shown. Because we live in an age when the
phrase “one nation under God” is an extremely touchy sub-
ject, Boykin’s overtly religious words sound even more eeri-
ly reminiscent to those of bin Laden’s when he describes his
terror faction’s “jihad” on America. Despite any insane logic
of ﬁghting “holy war with holy war,” President Bush has
made it very clear, especially on his current trip to Indonesia,
that the U.S.’s war on terror is not a war on Islam. But the
president’s intentions become less and less clear when he has
a top  commander running around telling folks exact-
ly the opposite. While I would personally start putting the
works of Dylan next to the works of Shakespeare in every

classroom, you don’t have to be the world’s greatest lyricist .

to warn people against idiocy. ,' ,

Declaring “God on your side” is nonsensical. It shows
the same logic as the Marlins fan sitting next to the Yankees
fan at church, both adamantly praying that God make their
team the victor. Using religion as justiﬁcalion puts people in
offensive and potentially dangerous situations. It’s a shame
to see that, with people already taking offense to the danger-
ous situation of the war on terror, the U.S. Government has
thrown another verbal hand grenade into ﬂre political mine-
ﬁeld. ' '

Holy crap! David .7 wrote a column of significant political
importance and he only had to make one penis joke to do it.

Changes to classic game shows can be good if done right

Sometime last week, I found
myself in the magnificent position of
being athome and in front of a TV.
Which day it was, I can’t recall — all
the days last week have blended
together in my memory;_ a bear of a
workload will do that to you.

But on this day, whatever day it
was, I was home early enough to watch
a syndicated episode of the greatest
television program ever, “Seinfeld.” In
fact, I was home so early that I could
watch “Jeopardy!” — something I
haven’t done in quite some time.

As the show started, however, I
was confronted with a startling reality
— the rules of “Jeopardy!” had
changed. Now a contestant can be on
the show as long as he or she keeps
winning. Being a five-day champion is
no longer the apex of “Jeopardy!” suc-
cess. I

This isn’t the first change the quiz-
masters over at “Jeopardy!” have made
recently. The set has been transformed
for the umpteenth time, the faux-digi-
tal display showing a contestant’s win-
nings has been replaced by a computer
generated one, the background of the
Daily Double spaces has been
changed, the Final Jeopardy music has
been tweaked, and, in what used to be
the most stunning change, the dollar
value of the questions has doubled.

All of these changes were’ for the

best. “Jeopardy!” is
something like a mil-
lennium old and it
needed to keep up with
those young’uns —
the big spendin’, free-
wheelin’ “Who Wants
to be a Millionaire?”
and “Greed,” among
others. At least the
“Jeopardy!” people
realized the changes
that needed to be made
to keep the show not
only interesting, but
also solvent. And

those post—modern jobs on the set of
“Jeopardy!”

Have you seen “The Weakest
Link,” “Pyramid,” the updated version
of “The $25,000 Pyramid,” and
“Whammy,” a reinvention of one of
the greatest game shows ever, “Press
Your Luck”? Apparently, those shows
are either occurring in some post-
industrial future wasteland where
things are stripped to their bare materi-
als _——- girders; sharp, jagged metal and
video screens that seemingly ﬂoat in
midair — or in a warehouse. Whatever
the case, those shows are wholly unac-

nomical propor-
tions, and it’s going to be very inter-
esting to see how long someone can
stay atop Mt. Jeopardy. Right now, the
highest level reached is being a seven-
day champ. But imagine a 10-day
champ or a 14-day one. It’s conceiv-
able, though not realistic, that some-
one could stay on the show for weeks.
Wouldn’t that be something?_

But this is dangerous territory. The
game show “2l” allowed its champi-
ons to be on for extended periods of
time, but it was revealed that this was
due less to the contestant’s smarts and
more to his likeability — the produc-
ers of the show would rig the game to
bring in higher ratings. It was the sub-

ject of an excellent film —— “Quiz
Show” — directed by Robert Redford.
And because of the game show scan-
dal, the rules governing such shows
had to be strict to avoid any other
scandals like the one that ripped open
“Z1.” -

That’s not to say “Jeopardy!” will
fall to the fate of “2l” and so many
other rigged game shows
“Jeopardy!” has been on so long now
that it’s the gold standard of modern
game shows, so it must be doing some-
thing right.

What keeps it so fresh and fun to
watch is the ability of the producers,
writers, judges and the man himself,
Alex Trebek, to keep it that way. All
the changes the show has gone through
over the past couple years are a testa-
ment to that. And as long as the show
can keep recognizing the changing
market and game show landscape and
keep up with it, it will last a whole lot
longer in that ficklest of all media +
television._The most recent update is
the show’s most bold and likely its
most important. It will keep people
watching and has already made the
show fresh and interesting again.

Now, if only something could be
done about those abominations of
game shows “Wheel of Fortune” and
“Hollywood Squares” — excuse me,
“H2.”

Don’t judge aband by its name  

Mouthful of Copper
Jerry Joseph and the Jackmormans

Terminus Records
7i‘r79n1‘r

Recommended if you like: Tom .Petty or
Brucespringsteen

What’s in a name? Well, in the opinion of

_many, a lot. When you first hear the name
_ Jerry Joseph and the J ackmormons, you might

find yourself a little bit wary of popping the
CD in your Discman and giving it a try. You
will be pleased if yo,u do, though. Mouthful of
Copper is unbelievable. Jerry Joseph and the

influences from other artists and bands, the
Jackmormons are very much their own entity.

‘They have ‘a distinct style and sound that will A

be talked about for years to come. Jerry Joseph
and the J ackmormons- have an all-American
quality to their music, like Bruce Springsteen

_ and Tom Petty before them.

Mouthful of Copper is a very eclectic, live
double album. One thing the songs have in
common is their-chill vibe. “Brother Michael”
starts off with a two-minute jam session. The
guitar chords are raw and uninhibited, adding
to the song’s control and substance. Lead
singer Jerry Joseph plays guitar and sings with
a raspy, full, quality voice. Brad Rosen is
smooth on the drums‘, playing solid beats and

J ackmormons play pure rock." Though there are

singing soulfully, while Junior
Ruppel sings and plays the bass.

r———————————————— Another Standout track Ontthe

with a more poppy sound than the
classic rock ‘n’ roll vibe you get on
the other songs. The end showcases
some pretty wicked guitar riffs and
a broken-down drum beat. The
crowd goes crazy in the background
as the guitar strums away.

Eerie, noisy destruction

I Name You Destroyer
Jucifer ‘ * ‘

Vellocette Records
72:72:

Recommended if you like:
Marilyn Manson, Evanescence

Remember that scene in “Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory”
when they are in the boat heading
down a tunnel? There are tons of
bright colors, but it is eerie, not
cheerful. You have that overwhelm-
ing. fear of the unknown. Even
worse than that fear is the scary
realization that you will see those
Oompah-Loompahs at the end of the
tunnel doing their creepy, little
dance. Take all those feelings and
combine them with complete and
utter confusion. It all perfectly
describes Jucifer’s I Name You
Destroyer.

One cannot deny that I Name
You Destroyer is an interesting CD.
Jucifer is made up‘of Ed Liveng/ood
and Amber Valentine. Liveng/ood
and Valentine combine any and
every instrument or sound into the

mix that they believe will add to.

their songs.

On “Dissolver,” all you _can hear
is drums, guitar and Valentine
screaming at the top of her lungs.
Her vocal chords have to hate her.
The song is a good remedy to sani-

ty. Even more alarming than the
crazy screaming’ his the fact that
halfway through the song there is an
eerie breakdown in which Valentine
practically coos.

“Queen B” can be described in
three words: Scary as hell.AVisions
of a possessed woman singing with
fire illuminating her face -could be
conjured in your mind throughout
the song. Valentine’s screaming
sounds like cries of agony and tor-
ture. It’s a little too much to handle.

It’s unbelievable that two people
can make so much noise. Jucifer has
been compared to the White Stripes
because of its ability to fill up every
bit of your eardrum. The compari-
son ‘is not too far off for the pure
fact that it is a band, of two talented
artists, but Jucifer is like the White
Stripes’ gothic antithesis — their
worst nightmare, if you will.

Jucifer is interesting to listen to,
and it’s easy to see why the band
have a growing fan base. Ijust don’t
think I have the stomach for it.

For those of you more experimental
than Sarah Butchin, be sure to
check out Jucifer on Oct; 25 at Mr.
Small ’s Theatre, located in Millvale.
Ticketsare $8, and for more infor-_
mation, go to www.mrsmalls.com.
Just be sure to bring some Tylenol
for after the show.

COURTESY LIONS GATE FILMS

Legends of the porn industry

Wonderland
Starring Val Kilmer, Kate
Bosworth, Lisa Kudrow

Directed by James Cox
ﬁfr 0

“Wonderland” is not as con-
cerned with its central character,
porn star John Kkklll (Val Kilmer),
as it is with being a shifty, gritty
crime drama/detective story. This is
despite the fact that the film’s pro-
logue proclaims it the story of what

"happened to Kkklll once “the leg-

end” —— he starred in 1,000 films,
gained worldwide notoriety and

slept with 14,000 women —+ was

oven

The problem is, the subject mat-
ter is wholly unappealing, the char-
acters unlikable, the pace grinding,
and the style muddled.

The whole time, I couldn’t stop
thinking, “Boogie Nights” —— a film
that borrowed from Kkklll’ story —-—
did this better in a single scene.

The title is a reference to
Wonderland Avenue, the scene of
some grisly, drug—related murders in
which Kkklll played some part.
Strung-out and desperate, his film
career over, he associated with both
the victims and their enemies -
they kept him around as a novelty.

Depending on whose story you
believe, the “porn king” was either
the mastermind of the massacre or
an unwitting accomplice to it.

There’s also the tangential story of
Dawn (Kate Bosworth), a young girl
Kkklll was romancing at the time,
which mainly serves to show us how
badly the man hurt the people who
loved him.

Most of the story is told in
flashback, after the murders, by sev-
eral narrators. The structure is taken
from “Citizen Kane” or Kurosawa’s
“Rashomon,” with various accounts
both adding to»and contradicting
one another, until it finally builds to
something definitive. In those films,

the format served the drama. In

“Wonderland,” it’s just tedious; a
bad fit for -the material.. V ,

New director James Cox heaps
on inconsistent style. He cuts
annoyingly fast —-— music—video fast

A — at points, and his use of various

filters and film stocks makes the
film look like Steven Soderbergh’s
whole career put in a blender.

Somehow, Cox persuaded a
bunch of capable actors to languish
in supporting roles here .— Lisa
Kudrow, Dylan McDermott,' Tim
Blake Nelson, Ted Levine, Natasha
Gregson Wagner, J aneane Garofalo,
and more.

Kilmer is quite good, though -
better than the film deserves. Well,
he’s good when the script allows
him to be. Not when it has him tear-
fully breaking down, screaming
“I’m Johnny f————ing Wad!” No one
could pull that off. No one.

Ghosts .

Sleeping at Last

Interscope Records

-ﬁnk

Recommended if you like:
Smashing Pumpkins and
Radiohead

Though its name sounds like a
soothing bedtime CD, three—man
band Sleeping At Last’s songs are
far from lullabies.

They haven’t been around all
that long —— they were formed only
five years ago, when brothers Ryan

  

(#12) C91,-SW2 ! lWNMDlI£X..{l!$

 

It’s not time for bed just yet

and Chad O’Neal started the band

with the help of their friend Dan

Perdue in a basement near Chicago.
In ’99, they self—released their first
CD, followed a couple years later
by Capture. However, Ghosts is
their most recent, arriving from
Interscope Records. T

Their sound is somewhere
between. their inspirations:
Radiohead and Smashing
Pumpkins. If you listen closely, you
may think the lead singer sounds
like the lead vocalist from

Lifehouse. It’s great music to listen

to if ‘you are chilling out with your
significant other or writing a paper.
With Ryan as lead vocalist and gui-
tar front man, Chad on drums, and
Perdue on bass, their rhythm flows
smoothly and stays rather constant.
Yeah, it’s a good make-out CD,

The guys give their listeners
hope and inspiration’ about fulfill‘-
ing their dreams, living life and
experiencing love that touches the
soul. Perhaps it was their belief in
themselves and their music that
gained them the friendship and sup-
port of the lead singer of Smashing
Pumpkins, Billy Corgan. He lis-
tened to their __demo tape at a show,
and gave them the breakthrough
they needed to finally be heard —
not just from outside their basement
doon ‘ ‘

Their first full—length album,
Capture, was the CD Corgan lis-
tened to and offered his advice
about, before eventually‘ giving
them the chance they needed to
begin recording Ghosts. Through.
Corgan’s inﬂuence, Ryan realized if
this CD of theirs was to have any
chance, he needed to focus more on
his writing. Ryan did so by pouring’
the truth out of his heart, producing
songs that are filled with feeling,
about a band that hasfound itself.

Perhaps life has begun taking

on awhole other meaning to the’
band members of Sleeping At Last.
The realization that if you work
hard and don’t give up, success is
waiting in the end, though this is
only the beginning for the guys.
I Their conscious choice to sing
from deep within themselves is
apparent throughout Ghosts. They
explore ‘a truthfulness that pours out
from their lyrics. If it is true that
they sing from their 1ife’s experi-
ences, then the first track, “Say,”
explains that they may haveifound
what they’re looking for, “Say what
you really want to say/And the
truest of forms will show/Finally
you’ll find your soul.”

It looks like Sleeping At Last is
nowhere near ready to be tucked
down into bed.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

 

 

Pi loose remain perfect in Big East

JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

At least Troy Nunes is gone.

No longer will the Pitt football
team have to worry about the Butler,
Pa., native and former Syracuse
quarterback stealing games from his
hometown team in the most ridicu-
lous of ways — such as picking up a
fumbled snap during a field goal
attempt, running about 30 yards
backwards, then calmly throwing a
touchdown pass in 1999.

Veteran Pitt football fans may be
well aware of the struggles the
Panthers have had against the
Orangemen over the years, except,
of course, for Pitt’s 48-24 victory in
the Carrier Dome last season. In
fact, Pitt hasn’t beaten Syracuse at
home since the 1989 season.

That would be the same 1989
season in which Mike Gottfried was
the head coach, Alex Van Pelt was
the freshman gunslinger playing
quarterback and Walt Harris actual-
ly coached against the Panthers at
Pitt Stadium for his alma mater
Pacific —— a school that no longer

has a football program.

Enough history. The Panthers
(4-2 overall, 1-0» Big East) ' have
more immediate reasons for needing
a win when Syracuse (4-2, 1-1)
comes to Heinz Field on Saturday at
noon. Remaining unbeaten in the
early Big East season would be at
the top of that list. . ‘-

To do so, Pitt will have to play
tougher in the trenches on both sides
of the ball. The Panthers haveihad
problems at times protecting quar-
terback Rod Rutherford and have
not run the ball as well as they
would have liked. ‘

“We need to upgrade the consis-
tency of our blocking,” Harris said
after practice on Wednesday.

Receiver Princell

Brockenbrough, who missed Pitt’s-

last game at Rutgers, practiced on
Wednesday and agreed by saying:
“Every offense needs balance.
Running is important.”

Syracuse’s run defense has

shown that it can be penetrated at’

times. Virginia Tech ran for 337
yards against the Orangemen two
weeks ago in Blacksburg, Va.

dr g last week’s 432_ victory over the"Scarlt hts. Walker and enthers 100 to

One area in which the Pitt
offense, has not had trouble, when
the line has blocked well, is getting
big plays out of the passing game.
Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald will
try to continue his torrid pace in
which he has scored a touchdown in
12 consecutive games, dating back
to last year. '

With Syracuse likely to concen-
trate on Fitzgerald, the Panthers will
have to continue to find secondary
targets. Tight end Kris Wilson had a
big game against Rutgers — a
career-high nine catches for 110
yards and a TD — and will try to

find seams in the middle of the

Orangemen defense.

If Brockenbrough is unable "to
play, senior Yogi Rothrand freshman
Greg Lee will have to step up "and
make plays. ,

"‘We like what we have [at
receiver] but‘ we’re real thin,”
Harris said. ‘ ’

Defensively, the'Panthers are

coming off a disappointing second

half at Rutgers in which the Scarlet

After dealing with over-

— 20-14 loss to a 1-3 team

Panthers need to right ship with fans against Syracuse

time  « 
packed N E’   

The last
Panther fans
Heinz Field, they left
with the bad taste of a

in their mouths.

Despite being
embarrassed on National
television, Pitt still has
an opportunity to win
the Big East title. And
thanks to West Virginia’s 28-7 upset
of No. 3-ranked Virginia Tech, a slim
hope may still remain of making th
BCS. -

What does that mean for our
Panther football team? It means that
Pitt will have to run the table if it still
has any’ hopes of competing for a “big
time” Bowl. '

It also means that the team’s quest
for perfection through the rest of the

.1 season starts tomorrow when the
- Syracuse Orangemen‘ come to Heinz 1

Field fresh off of a 39-14 victory over
the Boston College Eagles. The

Orangemen’s. win over the Eagles_

may be considered an upset. to ‘some,

‘ but it deﬁnitely can be classiﬁed as a

big win for their program.

' A trend that I have noticed, espe-
cially this season in College Football
is that teams do not respond well the

week following an upset or a big,vic- .

tory.

I’m not sure if teams come out
overconfiglent, in their following game
or if they used up all they had in their
victory. Last weekend, Wisconsin
could not give an encore performance
against Purdue after ' knocking off
then-undefeated Ohio State 17-10.

Earlier in the season, Oregon

, dealt Michigan its first loss of the sea- _

son-and did not show up the following
week, as Washington State crushed
the team 55-16. ,

Pitt needs to be able to take
advantage of the Orangemen, since
Syracuse is in a similar situation. No,
Boston College does not carry as
much clout as Michigan or Ohio
State, but most college fans probably
thought the Eagles would win. If not,
they certainly did not expect for
Syracuse to turn in such a dominant
performance.

Maybe the Panthers can feed off
of the ‘fact that they were able to do
something in 2002 that they had not
been able to do since I was a seven-

month-old baby in October 1982. _

They were able to beat the

Orangemen at the Courier Dome; now

they get Syracuse in their own back-
yard. ’

Pitt defeated Syracuse 48-24 on
the strength of a rushing attack that
amassed 180 yards on the ground.
Another key is that the defense only
allowed 275 yards of total offense.

 
 

Does anybody recog-
nize a pattern?

The things Pitt was
able to do last season that
enabled them to break the
curse of p the Courier
Dome are ‘things it has
3 struggled to do in the pre-

sent. In the past few

games, there has been
virtually no running game
with the exception of a sprinkling of a
few big runs, and the defense has
been allowing over 400 yards of total
offense.- ‘ 1
These are areas that need to be

’S

corrected in order to right the ship.
Before the season, there was the hope
of a Big East title and that Pitt would
contend for the national champi-
onship, but somewhere along the way,
the Panthers have gotten away from
the basics. ' '

In order to be a successful team,
you have to be able to run the ball and
play defense. Giving up 25 points in
one half and. letting a team back in a
game -when you have a 35-point lead
is unacceptable for anybody who

plans to compete for a championship.
It’s Homecoming on Saturday. 7

Give Panther fans something to be

excited about. From walking around
campus and hearing different conver-
sations about Pitt football, it was clear
that people were down about the loss
to Notre Dame. Fans need their faith
restored in their football team, and
last week’s second—half near-disaster

didn’t help matters.
Giving Syracuse a good old fash-
ion spanking in front of the

Homecoming crowd is just what is
needed to get Panther fans thinking
positively about Pitt football again.

tor for The Pitt News.

Garbage overﬂows after Notre Dame home games

FRoM STAFF REPORTS
U—Wire, The Observer, Notre Dame

(U—WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind. -
After the echoes have been awoken
and returned to rest, the teams have
left the field and the Sea of Green
has drained out of the gates, one
sound still whispers through Notre
Dame Stadium: The rustling of foil
wrappers and the hollow sound of
empty plastic cups rolling across
concrete.

In other words, after everyone
leaves a Notre Dame football game,
one thing that is left behind is

qumn:__

garbage — and lots of it. Outside
the stadium, the situation is much
the same. Trash bins in the parking
lots overflow with aluminum cans,
and litter of all kinds is sprinkled
throughoutcampus. ' T
The University spends a lot 0
money and time on the complex
process of returning Notre Dame to
a clean, litter-free campus after a
home football game. Several
University departments, including
Building ‘ Services, Landscape
Services and the Athletic
Department, collaborate with a mul-
titude of outside organizations to

 

  

{QED

make the clean—up efficient and
effective.

According to Dan Brazo, athlet-
ic facilities manager at Notre Dame
Stadium, the clean-up process
begins well before the game is over.

“After the first series, the stadi-
um crew goes around the outside of
the stadium and collects barrels, and
that trash is compacted,” he said.
“Immediately [after the game], we
have a contractor come’ in, and they
hand pick [up] all the trash.” 2

Brazo said that morning crews
come in- on Sunday with leaf blow-
ers to blow the smaller pieces of

garbage, such as peanut shells and
candy wrappers, into large con-
derised piles. The crews spend about
five hours cleaning up on Sunday,
starting at 7 a.m. and usually finish-
ing around noon.

Best Sweeping Specialists Inc.
is one of the several companies con-
tracted to assist in the football
weekend clean—ups. Tim Skinner,
president of the- company, said he
does not have exact figures on how
much garbage his company collects
from an average game, but he esti-
mated the amount to be between 18
and 24 cubic yards of material. Best
Sweeping is responsible for clean-
ing up the area between the inner
wall of the stadium and- Moose

'Krause Drive, which encircles the’

stadium.

“[The clean—up] is divided up.
Quite a few people work on picking
it up,” Skinner said. “But in terms
of litter, it’s one of the biggest jobs
we do.” Skinner said-

His company’s portion of the
clean—up usually takes between five

and six‘ hours on Sunday morning, ’
but that varies, depending on weath-.

er conditions. Best Sweeping also
sweeps the inside of the stadium
prior to the games to clear out trash
that was missed from the previous
game, as well as leaves and other
debris.

Due to limited manpower and
the large volume of trash produced
by the football crowds, most of the
material is sent to a landfill rather
than being recycled.

“There’s so much trash emitted
from a game, there’s really no way
to sort it,” said Brazo.

According to Alan Bigger, direc-
tor of Building Services, the conces-
sion stands at the stadium use large
amounts of cardboard, and most of
that is recycled, but nothing else is
sorted for recycling. _ —

Bigger «_said his department
attempted to institute a game—day
recycling program during the 1998
season, but the project was unsuc-
cessful. For each home game, they
set up 75 cardboard recycling’ con-
tainers around the stadium, clearly
marked for plastic bottles and alu-
minum cans and containing only one
round hole. Bigger said the hope

. was to catch recyclable items before

fans entered the stadium, but almost
all of the containers were complete-

_ly contaminated with food waste

and other non-recyclables.

The venture lost a significant
amount of money because none of
the collected recyclables could be

' sold, and the department has not

Nov. 1, 1971: Panthers take coach’s advicein Victoryover Syracuse

Editor’s note: This is the seventh in
a “Greatest Games” series that will
appear in The Pitt News the day
before each Pitt football game this

1 year. Each part in the series will

-1’-<2;

detail Pitt’s greatest game against
that week’s opponent, and will con-
tain the original game story as it
appeared in The Pitt News. This
story was written by Marty Hellman
on Nov. 1, 1971.

Before Saturday’s contest with
Syracuse began, Pitt head coach
Carl DePasqua told his team to
“have some fun in this game and not
to worry about mistakes.” _

The calming approach resulted
in a 31-21 victory for the Panthers
— now 3-4 —— as they beat the
Orangemen at their own game of

grinding out yardage and ball con-

trol.

Additionally, the Cats had-the
chance to capitalize on someone
else’s mistakes for the first time
this season. The Orangemen turned
the ball over on three fumbles and
the Panther offense converted the
recovered fumbles into two touch-
downs and a field goal.

“We got some fumbles and good
field position in the second half,
and we were able to cash in on

The Panther defense got off to a
rough start — the Orange scored the
first two times they had possession.
After that, Pitt stopped Syracuse
from making a

they did have the
ball.

Cindrich and Joe

He was hurt immediately after
he threw a short touchdown pass to
Steve Moyer, which knotted the
score at‘ 14 all. Bill Coghill,
Syracuse’s left defensive tackle

ball. .

Until Medwid left
the game, he engi-
neered the Panthers’
power-I offense, which
moved the ball well on
the ground against the

injected some nifty

behind again.

Dave Havern, who has rallied
the Cats in past games with passing,
took over and ‘stuck to the ground

in the air again. Havern led tight
end Joel Klimek in the far corner of

-the end zone with a 20-yard pass

Nov. 14, 1963 Mazurek rallies
Panthers with his arm and legs

Editor’s note: This is a special
Homecoming edition of the
“Greatest Games” series, featuring
the game story from a past
Homecoming game as it appeared
in The Pitt News. This story was
written by Al
Blumkin on Nov. 4,
1963.

“It was the best

football we’ve
played all year,”
said coach John

Michelosen. “They
made a great come-
back.”

Michelosen was
referring to the
Panthers? second
half play in the 35-
27 victory over
Syracuse Saturday at
Pitt Stadium.

Led by the pass-
ing and rushing of
Fred Mazurek, the

Panthers rallied
from a two—touch—
down deficit,
outscoring the
Orange, 27-7, in the
second half. The
victory over

Syracuse rekindled

hopes for a postseason bowl bid as
the Panthers uppedtheir record to
5-1.

Mazurek shook off his personal
disappointment over his perfor-
mance against Navy by piling up
255 yards in total offense. He raced
for 119 yards in 22 carries and com-
pleted 13 of 21 passes for 136
yards. He ran for two touchdowns,
one a brilliant 41-yard gallop,
passed for another and passed for a
pair of two—point conversions.

“It was the best game Fred has
played so far,” said Michelosen.

The coach also singled out Bill
Bodle and Joe Kuzneski in the
exciting victory. Bodle rushed for
32 yards and caught four passes for
34 yards. He picked up three key

at

 einwlns

lead by the half.

The Panthers righted themselves
and put on an awesome display of
football in the second half. On

first downs on the third touchdown
drive, which put the Panthers ahead
23-21 in the third quarter. He also
picked up two first downs in the
final drive which iced the game.
Kuzneski, who has played most-
ly defense during
his career here,
caught six passes
for 70 yards and was
Mazurek’s favorite
receiver throughout
the day. He can-
stantly broke loose
from his v defenders
to catch key passes.

“Joe has
improved greatly,”.
said Michelosen.

“His added maturity
and experience has
made him a better
player.”

In the first
half, however, the
Panthers looked like
the weather —
lousy. It seemed like
the Navy game all
over again as the
Panthers made
offensive and defen-
sive mistakes which
allowed the Orange
to pile up a 21-7

defense, Ernie Borghetti, Al
Grigaliunas and Ed Adamchik led
the charges that bottled up Syracuse
almost completely in the second
half. Their constant harassment of
the Syracuse backs was a key factor
in the victory. .

With this victory, the Panthers
should move up in the national"
rankings. Among the top ten in the
Associated Press’ football ratings
poll, sixth-ranked Wisconsin was
slaughtered by Michigan State, 30-

13, while ninth-ranked Southern '

California was

humbled by
Washington, 22-7, ‘

Rugby to
compete in

championship  

against West
Virginia

RYAN FALooN
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s rugby team has
been defending its League
Championship title all season, as it
was the Allegheny Rugby Union,
champion. It is apparent that they
are not ready to give it up.

Except for a solo loss inthe
final game of the regular season,

this year’s Pitt team is on the same:

page as last year’s team. The
Panthers will battle for their second
consecutive championship this
weekend, and they have a tremen-
dous advantage.

It's Homecoming weekend at
Pitt, and the Panthers play the
championship game at home
against rival‘ West Virginia on
Saturday. 1 

With a 7-1 overall, record on the
season, four of those wins have
come inconference play. They are
4-1 in conference play and have
outscored their opponents 240-58.

-Pitt’s single loss came against
Bowling Green in the final game of
the regular season, as it was defeat-
ed 27-19. Aside from this, the
Panthers have looked ﬂawless.

‘ After winning their first two
conference games 59-0 and 68-0,
respectively, Pitt blew away West
Virginia 51-10. The Panthers’“final
conference win came against
Miami, OH, as they pickedup a 43-
21 victory. ‘

The first J;ound of the playoffs
were a cinch for the Panthers, as
they cruised to a 44-5 victory over
Grove City. The win advanced them
to this week’s championship game
against West Virginia.-

No, really.

level because there were so many
people already there.

“The issue was that all the stu-
dents wanted into the lower level,”
said Jim Earle, the associate athlet-
ics director for new business. and
fan development. “The aisles were
filled because the section was over-
crowded, and it was hard to deter-
mine when to shut off the flow.”

Starting with Saturday’s
Homecoming game _ against
Syracuse, students will be ‘given a
wristband as they enter the stadium.

,1 if‘PRlE—GAMEPARTY

According to Earle, the wristbands
will help Heinz Field security tell
where a student is sitting.

“We want students [who] get
there early to have the best seats,
and we want the best seats to be
full,’’ Earle said. “When they come
in,.students will grab-a wristband. It
shouldn’t be that difficult.”

Since the section is general
admission, the earlier students
arrive at the game, the closer to the
field they would get to sit. By hav-
ing a wristband, students will be
able to prove that they were in the
stadium early.

The average attendance among
students last season was only 5,000,

according to Earle, making it diffi-
cult to assign seats in the section.

“We’d have empty seats on the
lower leve_l,” he said-. “This addi-
tional measure will help to avoid
overcrowding.” .

Although they knew that a lot of
students would be attending the
game, Earle admits that the depart-
ment did not anticipate that there
would be that many. I}

“We knew we’d have full stu-
dent sections, but I would figure
that they’d want to go upstairs,

where there was more room to
watch the game,” he said. “We did-

,n’t expectit to be as it was, with

people flooding into the aisles and
blocking [them]. This was the first
time it was that severe of an issue,
and if the [football] team wins the
big ones, it could get worse.”

While he realizes that students
may have lost faith in thegathletics
department, Earle hopes that stu-
dents realize the department is
doing this for their safety.

“-It’s‘ going to take a while for us
to regain credibility with‘ the stu-

. dents,” Earle said. '

not move closer, Knisely proved
accurate from the 34-yard line with
three points that put the game out
of the Orangemen’s reach.

In the waning minutes,
Syracuse drove to the Panther 1-

yard line.'Without the pressure of _

an imperative goal—line stand, the
defense held for the first time this
season. Syracuse’s frustrations
ended as the clock ran out.

“We were in a prevent=defense,”
said defensive coach Serafino Fazio
about the final SU drive. “That
goal—line stand did more for us that
anything — it gave us a lot of con-
fidence.”

A surprise addition to the
Panther starting lineup was John
White, the soccer teams’ goalie and
forward. Although he just began
practicing kickoffs this week.
DePasqua' elected to have him-per-
form the specialty.

White, who played goal earlier
in the day for the booters, was
ecstatic after the contest.

“This is what I dreamed about,”
he exclaimed. “I just wish that I
had done better.” ' _ .

Bob Kuziel, the Panther center
who represents one gridder that

Syracuse coach Ben Schwartwalder '

missed in recruiting, brimmed with
joy in the locker room.

“For me, this meant winning the
rubber match with Syracuse,” he

emphasized, referring to the past-

three Panther—Orange contests.

Building Services willing to recycle garbage

attempted game—day recycling since
then.

Bigger said Building Services
would be willing to try recycling
again, but budget constraints man-
date that volunteers would be need-
ed to help with Sorting the material
and transporting the receptacles to a
central location after the game was
over

Pat O’Hara, manager of
Warehouse Services in the Building
Services department, is in charge of
the recycling program on campus
and said his crew already handles a

larger—than—usual amount of recy-
clables on football weekends just
from residence halls and academic
buildings.

“It’s a massive operation,”
O’Hara said, in reference to han-
dling the recyclables on football
weekends. “That’s basically all we
do all day Monday.”

Recyclables are not unloaded
during the weekends because the
bins look unsightly on loading
docks and most people do not work
on the weekends. O’Hara said his
crew prepares for the job by work-
ing from 5 a.m. until 9 a.m. on the
morning before a home game, plac-

ing trucks around campus in strate—

gic locations like the Hammes‘

Bookstore and the Morris Inn.
Bigger said that a good portion
of the recyclable aluminum from
games ends up getting recycled
through what he called a “subter—
ranean operation.” He said commu-
nity groups like Boy Scouts and

‘church groups travel through the

parking lots after the game has
begun, collecting the aluminum
cans.- The cans can then be sold to
the recycling center near downtown
South Bend. Many fans also collect
the plastic souvenir cups inside the
stadium, he said.

Both teams look for second conference win

Preview, page 30

Knights were able to come back,

largely through the air, and make an
interesting game out of what should
have been a Pitt blowout.

Pitt has also struggled against
the run and cannot allow Syracuse
running back Walter Reyes to run
through the holes that Notre Dame
running back Julius Jones ran
through a few weeks ago.

Quarterback R.J. Anderson is
also a running threat for the
Orangemen, who sometimes employ
an option attack.

Anderson, a senior who has
been heavily criticized by Syracuse
fans during his career, has improved
this season. He has thrown for 1,103
yards and seven touchdowns while

running for 205 yards and three
more touchdowns. Anderson is also
the only starting quarterback in the
country who has not thrown an
interception this season.

Pitt’s defense currently ranks
86th in the country in yards permit-
ted per game with an average of
406.8 yards given up and will try to
start bringing that number down
against the Orangemen.

On special teams, the Panthers
seem to have found a punt—returner
in senior defensive back Tutu
Ferguson. Ferguson has - averaged
10.8 yards per punt and. has broken
several returns for long gains.

Both teams will be looking for
their second conference win when
they take the field at noon on
Saturday.

Seriously.
