Bombs hamperelef grops’ effort

TYLER MARSHALL & MEGAN GARVEY
Los Angeles Times

PESHAWAR, Pakistan — The sweat-drenched crew

, loading sacks of grain onto Afghanistan—bound trucks

here was working ﬂat out earlier this week when the
news came: U.S. bombs had dealt a glancing blow to the
World Food Program’s main grain storage warehouse in
Kabul, the Afghan capital. 
Although the warehouse remained intact, doubts
suddenly cloudedthe task at hand.'The largest shipment

- i of food in more than a year was being shipped to help
millions of Afghans get through the oncoming winter —

withoutstarving, but if storage facilities in Kabul weren’t
safe, should the grain even go? ‘

, On Tuesday, a bomb struck the Kabul compound of T 
. F the International Committee of the Red Cross, wounding

one worker and setting two warehouses on ﬁre.
‘Even before the United States and Britain began
bombing Afghanistan on Oct. 7, the international'relief

, community had faced huge challenges in its effort to

stave off a humanitarian disaster there.
, Now it’s facing a nightmare. .

Getting food to an estimated Six million people in
danger of starving or going hungry is only one relief pro-
gram hampered by the U.S. campaign against
Afghanistan’s Taliban regime. Other efforts aimed at eas-
ing suffering in one of the world’s poorest, rnost fought-
over lands, including health care, sanitation, water deliv-
ery and mine clearance projects, have all been drastical-
ly affected. Many programs have simply ground to a halt.

“Afghanistan is one of the toughest jobs we’ve ever
had,” said World Food Program spokesman Michael

YURI KOZYREV/LOS ANGELES TIMES

In Afghanistan, anti-Taliban ﬁghters adopt lost boys such as 14-year-old Alauddin, who dreams of avenging
his -father’s death in battle as he in turn learns the art of war. ‘ '

. Because of all this, World Food Program ofﬁcials
decided to keep loading after Monday’s' bomb strike in

Huggins. “Hundreds of thousands of people live in

staff, winter is on its way, and we’re racing against the
clock to get food in there.”

Police citetwo SGB members

Algie, Fish say police were mistaken in separate incidents

Pitt police will reconsider

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

In two separate incidents last week, Pitt police cited-

5 Student Government Board members John Algie and

Lonny Fish for underage drinking. Both say they will

plead not guilty..
Oﬂicer cited Fish, 19, at the Cathedral of Learning

A at 9:19 pm Thursday. But according to Fish, who has

served on Pitt’s alcohol advisory committee, he had not
consumed any alcohol. Fish said he was attending a play
in the basement of the Cathedral that evening, but had to
leave the production to use the bathroom.

Embarrassed by having to walk through the play’s
action —- the studio theater’s design leaves little room for
aisles — Fish said he grabbed the program of a woman
in the audience on his way out. But, he said, he returned
the program. .

According to Fish, he was later confronted by an

actor in the play, who grabbed him by the neck and
accused him of causing a disturbance. The Pitt police
were called, and according to Fish, showed up in full
force. - I

‘There were like three cruisers and 10 police ofﬁ-

cers,” Fish said, describing his encounter with the police.
He said that officers repeatedly asked him whether he
had been drinking, and he responded that he hadn’t.

“I’m sure there was a funky smell coming out of my
mouth because I was sick,” Fish said, adding that he has
visited Pitt’s Student Health Services in the past week for
a lingering illness.

“I had no alcohol in me, I had nothing on me,” Fish
said. ~
Fish said the officers continued to question his sobri-
ety, but that he remained calm and agreed to submit to a
Breathalyzer test. But Fish said after he agreed to a test,

Post-Gazette bigwig
says papers must
diversify to survive

LARA HUFFMAN
Staff Writer

Despite all the coverage the media has
devoted to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -
and in particular, their impact on the
Muslim community — Lorraine Branham
said the media “missed that story.”

According to Branham, there was very
little newspaper coverage of Muslim com-
munities before Sept. 11 because of a lack
of diversity among newspaper reporters and
editors. She compared this to the dearth of
black reporters at newspapers in the 1960s,
which resulted in newspapers failing to ade-
quately cover the ﬁrst developments of the
civil rights movement.

Branham, assistant to the publisher at
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, gave a speech
Tuesday at 7 p;r_n. titled “Diversity in the
Newsroom: HowNewspapers Reﬂect their
Communities,” which was sponsored by
The Pitt News. ‘

In her 25 years of journalism experi-
ence, Branham has worked at seven news-
papers. She was vice president and execu-
tive editor of the Tallahassee Democrat
before shecame to the Post-Gazette. '

Branham said the issue of diversity in
the newsroom is more important than ever
in light of the Sept. 11 attacks. Her speech
focused on diversity of race, gender and age
in print journalism. She said minorities
make up only 12 percent of the print jour-
nalism ﬁeld

According to Branham, diversifying
the newsroom is “morally the right thing to
do” because it would reﬂect the changing
complexion of the nation. Quoting a recent
census report, Branham said that 30 percent
of the American population are minorities.
By the ‘year 2050, she said, that statistic will
rise to 50 percent

Branham spoke about her experience
at the Democrat and shared a story about
the difficulties she faced when she wanted
to hire a female reporter in the paper’s
sports department The department was all
men, and she hoped to diversify it Though
plenty of qualiﬁed male writers applied,
Branham said she held out for nine months
before she found the right female candidate,

“It gets harder when you have to irnple—
ment this in your newsroom,” Branham
said She continued to say that some people
thought she had a “race hang-up” because
of her insistence on diversity as a black
woman._  _ A

 alsoidiscussed the role uni-
versities ‘ play in the diversity issue.
According to her, universities are not tum-
ing out enough minority print journalists.

LAUREN KOCH/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Lorraine Branham, assistant to the
publisher of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
discussed newsroom diversity last night.

To alleviate this problem, Branham
suggested that universities hire more minor-
ity professors to mentor and encourage
minority students. She said it was important
for minority students to walk around cam-
pus and see others who look like them.

A professor encouraged Branham to
write for the Temple News when she
attended Temple University. She said‘ the
ﬁrst thing she noticed when she walked into
the oﬁice were white editors and white
journalists. Because she felt unwelcome
and the editors shot down her ideas, she
stopped writing for the paper.

After Branham ﬁnished her speech,
she answered questions from the audience,
on topics ranging from reverse discrimina-
tion to the black community’s relationship
with the media. '

In response to an audience member’s
question, Branham spoke of the two-
faceted problem of black communities dis-
trusting the media and the media’s reluc-
tance to venture into these same communi-
ties. '

“I ﬁnd that unacceptable,” Branham
said of Pittsburgh reporters who refuse to
go into neighborhoods such as the Hill
District and Homestead.

Sophomores Regina McMahon and
Maureen Lally attended Branham’s lecture
for their introduction to journalism class.

“She was an impressive speaker. I like
that she had a wide array of experience in
print journalism,” McMahon said “I never

thought [diversity] was that much of an

issue inthe newspapers. I didn’t realize the

»_ statistics were so low.”

Lally agreed

“I think it needs to be changed. We, the
young people and future journalists, need to
take action and change it,” Lally said i

direct threat during Saturday’s
anthrax scare. According to him,
evacuating the dormitories was an
overreaction.

“The situation was going faster
than it needed to go,” he said. “You

' keep people in shelter in situations

like this. I’d rather have them safe
in their dorms.”

But Delaney added that he
believed whoever triggered the fire
alarms that emptied the residence
halls probably did so out of concern
for the students’ safety.

Pitt and city police evacuated
the William Pitt Union and Hillman
Library Saturday night after receiv-
ing phone calls threatening the
release of anthrax.

Shortly thereafter, fire alarms
sounded in many of the nearby resi-
dence halls, causing an exodus of
students from the- buildings. This

complicated an already difficult.

homecoming weekend traffic situa-
tion.

Special Deployment Division
Commander Rashall Brackney
agreed with Delaney that the build-
ings should not have been evacuat-
ed. . * —

“If the _[students] are not under
threat, why would you bring them
out and put them in harm’s way?”
she said. .

What officials have not agreed
upon is who orderedgthe evacuation.

Brackney said city police have
not determined who activated the
fire alarm, but she saidthe order did
not originate with the city police.

Several students and one
employee in the Schenley

_Quadrangle residence halls said Pitt

police evacuated the buildings by
pulling the fire alarms.

Delaney acknowledged that

some people have said they wit-"

nessed Pitt police pulling the
alarms. But Delaney said the order
to evacuate the building did not
come from Pitt police, and said
“there may have been instruction
[from city police].”

Delaney said that in locations
where authorities make the decision
to evacuate, fire alarms provide the
most effective method of notifying a
building’s occupants. Not only does
an alarm quickly reach everyone in a
given building, it continues to func-
tion throughout an emergency.

“People who come into the

building see there’s something

going on,” Delaney said.

When emergency workers
cleared the Union Saturday evening,
they did not activate the central fire
alarm.-Instead, police officers made
a physical sweep of the building
after managers made an announce-
ment over the intercom.

“I asked my guys why they did-
n’t pull the alarm,” Delaney said.
“They said the managers made an
announcement.”

Relief, page _1

Kabul. By early Tuesday, a convoy of‘
about 60 trucks carrying enough wheat to
feed 100,000 Afghans for a month had
begun the perilous journey through the
Khyber Pass to Kabul. For those involved
in the intense international aid effort,
there seemed little choice ‘but to press
ahead. _

For some, there was an irony that the
wheat that narrowly avoided destruction
by a U.S. air strike was itself American.

,W"1th only a few weeks before the
ﬁrst snows settle into the remote, drought-
ravaged regions of northern Afghanistan,
the World Food Program is desperately

‘ pushing grain into the beleaguered coun-

The aid comes from staging points in
Iran and Turkmenistan in the west and
Tajikistan in the north as well as from
Pakistan in the east. It all funnels into
Kabul, which has the necessary storage
facilities. Once it’s in the capital, private-
ly funded aid groups distribute it to remot-
er areas of the country. ‘

“We’re racing against the clock to
reach those in the worst-affected northern
provinces,” Huggins said. “If we’re lucky,
winter will be late, and we’ll have six
weeks. If we’re not, it could be only a
mon .” .

For nearly half a million Afghans, the
difference is critical. '

The giant convoy that left here
Tuesday was the third in the last 10 days
to leave Peshawar for Kabul, but World
Food Program officials admit that the
pace simply isn’t fast enough.

“‘Conditions are tough,” Huggins
said. “There just are not enough drivers
available willing to make the trip.”

WFP officials say they now plan to
supplement grain supplies with airdrops
of so-called high—energy biscuits, but only
once the U.S. air war ends.

But inthe international aid communi-
ty, airdrops are known to be the least efﬁ-
cient and most expensive way of getting
food supplies to needy people — almost.
12 times as costly as taking food by truck.
In Afghanistan, food drops also may fall
into the many mineﬁelds left over from
more than two decades of war. a

In addition to the bombing campaign
in Afghanistan, U.S. airplanes have been
dropping high-calorie food packets into
civilian areas. Aid workers contend that
this effort is largely a public relations
stunt and does very little to meet
Afghanistan's long-teirn food needs, and

‘even the U.S. government admits it’s a

stopgap measure.

Fazel Karim Fazel, who‘ directs a
rriine-clearing operation inside
Afghanistan, said some of his 120 work-
ers have found the food packets in areas
still implanted with explosives.

C ‘ “Our concern,” Fazel said, “is that
these refugees who have been walking for

many days will become very hungry. In
their rush to get food, they might come
across a mineﬁeld.”

Aid distribution inside Afghanistan is
also seriously hampered by a shortage of
trained workers.’

Witllin a few days of the Sept. 11 ter-
roiist attacks in the United States, foreign
staff directing aid efforts left Afghanistan
for neighboring Pakistan. CARE
International, which.had a staff of more

than 450 in Afghanistan at the start of last

month and supported a variety of projects,

. including water distribution, road build-

ing and education, has pared down to
fewer than 20 and keeps just one project
going — a water delivery network in

Kabul that is the only source of water for
35,000 of the city’s residents.

“If we stop this project, people will
die,” said Mohammed Halirn Fidai, a
CARE official in Peshawar.

For most aid organizations, commu-
nications with local staff members still
inside Afghanistan all but ended with the
Taliban’s edict a few days after the U.S.
air strikes began that anyone caught using
a satellite telephone would be executed on
the spot. with land telephone lines sparse
and unreliable, the ban has in effect cut
off the struggling local staff from their
supervisors in Pakistan.

There are other problems.

Riots in Pakistan sparked by the air.

Efficacy of Afghanistan relief groups questioned M

campaign have turned the blue—and-white
U.N. emblem into a target for protesters
lashing out at any symbol of the West.

In the western Pakistani city of ;

Quetta, a bastion of pro-Taliban senti-
ment, demonstrators last week set ﬁre to a
UNICEF office and broke windows at a
U.N. refugee agency oﬁice.

About the same time, Taliban sup-
porters inside Afghanistan attacked
employees of the U.N.—afﬁliated mine-
clearance program.

In a sign of the times, World Food
Program truck convoys inside
Afghanistan quietly put away the U.N.
ﬂags that in more normal times serve as a
protective emblem.

Thirteen bullets without intent?

Do 13 bullets equal an accidental
shooting?

In Allegheny County, that seems to be
the rule — at least for white police officers
who shoot black men.

Last Thursday, former Pittsburgh
Housing Authority police ofﬁcer John
Charmo pled guilty to involuntary
manslaughter for the ‘ shooting of Jerry
Jackson in 1995. Jackson, 44, was ﬂeeing
from police in a stolen car.

For ﬁring 13 of the 14 bullets that
killed Jackson, the court sentenced
Charmo to_1l 1/2 to 23 months in jail. He
will be eligible for parole Dec. -22.
Involuntary manslaughter means that
someone kills another person by accident
— the fact of death occurred, but the intent
was not present.

Charmo claims that he shot Jackson
out of fear. While Jackson had attempted
to ram Charmo’s police car, 13 bullets is
excessive, especially from a police officer.

Police ofﬁcers are trained to “serve
and protect.” Police ofﬁcers are out to
help, not hurt. Unloading 13 bullets into a
man, even out of fear, is unwarranted.

Allegheny County District Attorney
Steven A. Zappala Jr. said he feared a
hung jury or a not guilty verdict if he were
to retry Charmo on a homicide charge.
Another jury already deadlocked in
February.

How is it possible that the district
attorney could not show malicious intent

from 13 bullets?

Ahung jury in this case smacks of the
South during the 1960s. The .fact that
Zappala was afraid to try Charmo again
carmot say anything good about race rela-
tions in Allegheny County.

Already this county has a reputation
for racism. The city police department
currently has a civilian review board and
federal consent decree, and few can forget
the fatal beating of Johrmy Gammage by
Brentwood police oﬂicers for the crime of
being a black man driving a luxmy car.

The county’s record on race relations
has supposedly improved in the last few
years. But this plea bargain shows, as
Pittsburgh NAACP President Tim Stevens
said Oct. 16 in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, “another example of the devalua-
tion of black life in Pittsburgh and
Allegheny County.”

The NAACP is asking the U.S.
Justice Department and the FBI to investi-
gate this incident for a cover-up. This is
similar to how the federal government
charged the Los Angeles police officers

who beat Rodney King in 1991 with civil.

rights violations after state courts cleared
them of the beating itself. The federal gov-
ernment should pursue the matter to the

' fullest extent of the law.

Firing 13 bullets into a man, no Irrat-
ter if a police ofﬁcer felt fear or not, should
never result in what Stevens called “a slap

. on the wrist.”

I Firsthand lessons from

  .Ground Zero

ROBBIE ALI
The Pitt News

The images of what I saw when I
arrived at Ground Zero are bumed into my

- brain. It was a scene from hell. The scale of

the destruction was enormous. You’ve all
seen it on television many times I’m sure,
but I hope I can describe what it was like to
be there as an emergency medicine physi-
cian in the three days following the Sept 11
attacks. V

Imagine two buildings, each one

’ almost three times as high as the Cathedral

of Learning, reduced to a ﬁve-story pile of
rubble extending over an area about a half-
mile in diameter — the size. of central
Oakland. Oﬁice papers and ash cover the
streets for more than a mile around. Gray
smoke hangs 500 feet into the air, blocking
the sun and stinging eyes and throats. Fires
still burn in surrounding buildings. A fallen
10-story chunk of steel ﬁom the World
Trade Center gouged a huge scar into the
face of an adjacent skyscraper, itself 50 sto-

. ries tall. Another 70-foot spear-like chunk
of steel is embedded in the street,

Thousands of ﬁremen and rescuers work in
the ruins. Bodies and body parts are canied
out in orange body bags.

I helped set up a triage station in what
was left of a ﬁrehouse" at Ground Zero.
People from New York and all over the
country came to do what they could; We
began to realize we weren’t going"~to ﬁnd
many more survivors in the wreckage. The

last one was pulled out at about noon on .

Wednesday. Most of the people inside —
more than 5,000 — had simply been cremat-
ed. They were now part of the ghostly cloud

them.

But there was something else. We all
hadone purpose: trying to help. We became
closer, more open, more giving. I am grate-
ful to havehad the privilege of becoming
part of this new community. Since I got
back to Pittsburgh I have felt much of the
same sense of unity and kindness, a shared
grief and a new willingness to help the com-
mon cause. '

I only hope that we can keep this feel-
ing growing, that we can unite with all of
humanity against hatred, violence and
injustice. If we want to take the lead in a

world Lmited, we must ﬁrst better under-

stand it and ourselves. We need to deeply
identify with the rest of this world and deep-
en our compassion for those who suffer.‘ It
is not just the American ﬂag that should be
ﬂying from countless porches, yards, cars
and backpacks, but also the ﬂag of the earth,
this common home of humanity.

I hope we can expand the boundaries
of ourselves, beyond our families, our com-
munities and our countries. I hope we can
become global patriots, good citizens of_ the
planet. ‘I

In spite of what I saw at the World
Trade Center — or maybe because of it — I
ask myself if Ame1ica’s new war is really

just a case of good against evil. Are the '

hearts of those we are ﬁghting made differ-
ently from our own?

Or would we, if we grew up as they
did, in circumstances we can hardly imag-
ine, think and act as they do? I hope not

  Focus: homecoming coverage

Homecoming. or anthrax?

This letter is in response to
Nkemjika Ofodile’s complaint
about the “inadequate” ‘coverage
that homecoming received, or more
speciﬁcally, the lack of pictures of
the homecoming queen herself
(Letter to.the editor, Oct.__ 15). The
last time I checked, the newspaper‘
was called “The Pitt News,” not
“Homecoming Royalty: Bow to Our
Splendor.” I think Ofodile needs a
bit of perspective here. With the
horrific events of Sept. 11 and. now
the frightening. threat of anthrax,
most of us are _. not thinkjing about
how, pretty the .homecoming_‘ court
looked’ on their special night. '

Perhaps, there - wasn’t  more
 homecoming- _ coverage- ‘because ,

many students just don’t ‘care. The
selection of the homecoming court

is", little more than a popularity con-‘

test, and to devote more than ‘one
article - even more than one picture
— to it is abominable.

Ofodile complained that “there
have been articles in the past on
those who made homecoming court,
so therefore, it is not clear to me as
to why not this year.” Now careful-
ly consider which articles were
included in Monday’s paper. This
may be shallow of me, but I person-
ally thought that the library and stu-
dent union evacuations deserved

more attention than the ho’rnecom-
ing court. While homecorfring is
fun, I don’t think that it merits the
coverage that it actually did receive,
let alone what Ofodile thought it
should get.

’ So Ms. Ofodile, I sincerely con-
gratulate you on your homecoming
triumph‘. My heart ’ is breaking
because you don’t have pictures
from the newspaper to send to
friends and family. I don’t know
what The Pitt News was thinking
when it gave preference to the story
about campus building evacuations
over your shining moment. I know
that the recent anthrax scare right
hereon campus pale in comparison
to the wonder of the homecoming
court, and I am "glad that you
brought this to everyone’s attention.

Homecoming coverage

lacking’

Hooray for Nkemjika Ofodile’s
comments on homecoming cover-
age. I, too, looked for her picture in
the following Monday’s issue of
The Pitt News, only to get a view of
her hairdresser’s work. I must
admit, however, that my motives
were completely voyeuristic.

Ofodile claims that coverage
should have been better because her
election was a step forward for the
minorities of the Pitt campus. While
that my be true, I think the coverage
should a have been better because
homecoming weekend and the
crowning of homecoming queen
and king are major events on the
campus and deserve better cover-
age. .
You claim that your -coverage of
minority issues has been adequate,
citing recent articles. Nine of the 10

articles cited dealt with the Black. A -

Action Society or homosexual
issues. There were three pictures in
the ‘issue of The Pitt News in which
Ofodile’s letter appeared that
weren’t pictures of your columnists
or sports photos. Is it any wonder
why one of the three photos includ-

‘ed the BAS “Ms. Black University

of Pittsburgh” and another included
an officer of Rainbow Alliance? It
seems that your priorities on minor-
ity issues are quite evident.

were Deshaun Sewell, Ms. Black

face. Please be considerate of this
campus’s silent minority — Voyeurs’!

F Perry Farrell brings new music festival to town

Jubilee Festival
Friday, 7:30 p.m.
Mellon Arena, $40.50

STEVE MOGG
Staff Writer

From the ashes of the mighty
Lollapalooza rises Perry Farrell’s
newest brainchild, the Jubilee
Festival. Just as Lollapalooza
brought the spotlight to new bands,
the Jubilee Festival brings the spot-
light back to some of your favorite
old acts of the ‘90s.

Jane’s Addiction and Live are
two acts that saw much success last
decade, and to some extent still do,
but the British act Stereo‘ MC’s could
use their slot on the bill to recapture
some of the success .they found
almost 10 years ago.

Armed with , a critically
acclaimed new album, Deep Down &

Dirty, the MC’s are_looking to leave

their mark on the audience that has
all but forgotten them.

The MC’s made their mark in the
‘90s with music that gave off hip-hop

vibes, but whose heavy electronic
beats encouraged dancing. The MC’s
inﬂuence is evident in bands like the
Chemical Brothers and the Crystal
Method.

« “We’ve been interested in doing
this since we heard about it five
months ago. There was a lot of con-
fusion as to who would be playing,
but we were always up for it,” said
MC’s lead singer _Rob Birch with a
heavy Briti_sh accent in a phone inter-
view from England.

With guaranteed crowd—pleasing
tracks from Deep Down & Dirty, like
“Running,”, “Deep Down & Dirty,”
“Sophisticated” and “The Right
Effect” as well as old favorites like
their 1992 single “Connected,” the
MC’s are sure to find approval with
the ‘rock audience that Jane’s
Addiction and Live bring in. L

“We’re used to playing to rock

crowds. We’ve supported bands like

Living Colour on tour, and we like to

,,, The Stereo Me's
‘F A _.

experiment with different audi-
ences,”,Birch said.

The MC’s are excited about the
challenge that Jubilee has given
them. “We want to reach people who
aren’t into us,” Birch ‘said. “Our

-‘music is universal. Anyone can get

into it.”

The Stereo MC’s will find just
how universal their music really is
when they take the stage on Friday.
Jane’s Addiction and Live will see if

Stereo MC’s,

(‘Hi l-Ill,‘-‘\ \‘ \ii-H\LH’\l

they can rekindle
their old ﬂames
of success as
well.

-never die. They just join forces and

put on a super tour. So thanks to the
Live and Jane’s
Addiction, the ‘90s are back. Grab

Frank Gratkowski Trio
Tonight, 8 p.m.

Public Health Auditorium, $10
(412) 422-8864

Multi—instrurnentalist Frank
Gratkowski will bring his avant—garde jazz
inclinations to Pitt’s Public Health
Auditorium tonight. Fellow jazz ‘experi-
mentalists John Lindberg on bass and Gerry
Hemingway on drums will accompany
him .

‘Gratkowski, who plays the alto saxo-

‘ phone, clarinet and ﬂute, among other

instruments, has participated in a large num-
ber of musical lineups over the last decade,
working with pianists, percussionists and
trombonists. On thet'l997 release The
Flame Factor, his collaborators ‘include
Hemingway and bassist
Manderscheid. , _ -- . .

The Flume Factor features eight instru-

mentals, some of which easily pass the 10-‘
minute mark. The tn'o’s compositions rim‘

the spectrum of styles, from the qu_iet—to—
loud interplay of “Epistasis,” to the cheerful,
warped “Three Vegetables for Double
Happiness,” to the danceable “California
Roll.” -
Unless you ﬁnd off-kilter beats and
melodies that don’t quite harmonize to be
soothing, don’t expect to relax to the sounds
on this album. The Flame Factor requires
close listening in order to grasp the band’s

«Dieter ‘

jittery rhythms and discordant tones. The
accessible swinging beat of “California
Ro ” is the exception, rather than the rule,
as far as the group is concemed.

_" In general, the tn'o’s music features
many sudden stops and starts, swells of dis-
cordance and the use of unorthodox sounds,
such, as clicking woodblocks in ‘Three
Vegetables for Double Happiness.” On
occasion, the group uses traditional instru-
ments in unique ways, asin “The ,"B’ Zone,”
which features cello-like blasts ofpoise that
sound like cars rushing along
The F lame Factor shows that, refreshingly,

Wednesday, October 17, 2001

the Frank Gratkowski Trio is quite able and
willing to take risks in their arrangements.

If you like your music to be adventur-
ous and complex, this t1io’s stellar musi-
cianship and bizarre compositions and
instrumentation should prove appealing.
Even if you prefer mainstream music, try ‘to
see this group.

Your avant—garde jazz hip—ness quo-
tient will skyrocket if you can say, “Yeah,
the beginning of F lame by the Frank
Gratkowski Trio  now that was a good

The Blind Boys of Alabama
With the Robert Cray Band
Tonight, 7:30 p.m.

Rosebud, $17

(412) 261-2221

If Robert Johnson had romanced Sam Cooke in the back
of a gospel church, The Blind Boys of Alabama would be
their love child. A littlebit bluesy, a little bit spiritual and a
whole lotta soul.

The Blind Boys of Alabama can make a claim few other
bands can -— they’ve been performing for more than seven
decades. The band members, who— met at the Talledega
Institute for the Blind in 1939, mix traditional spirituals,
blues and rock ‘n’ roll to create their fresh sound.

On their latest album, Spirit_ of the Century, The Blind
Boys of Alabama get back to their roots with gospel stan-
dards like “Good Religion” and “Nobody’s Fault but Mine.”
The band also offers renditions of contemporary songs by
Tom Waits, Ben Harper and The Rolling Stones. “Amazing
Grace,” set to the tune of “House of the Rising Sun,” is an
exceptional track on the album and gives its listeners a twist
on a hymnal standard.

When you’re backed by industry legends like Charlie
Musselwhite, David Lindley and John Hammond, the result
is sure to be passionate but edgy. That’s just what The "Blind
Boys of Alabama deliver. Their best assets by far are their
voices, which range from gruff and throaty to tender and
haunting. _ -

Spirit of the Century gives you the impression that if yo

found God playing a harmonica under a weeping willow, this
is what it would sound like.

The Blind Boys of Alabama are, in one word, heavenly.

Woman enough

Are You Man Enough?
Betty Blowtorch
Foodchain Records
72r7L‘¢'7i‘r

It’s silly, sleazy and lots of fun.
Betty Blowtorch — like the Spice Girls
gone very, very wrong — explodes onto
the music scene with a style of raucous
punk metal that hasn’t been above

, ground since Tommy Lee cut his hair.

The four tattooed divas that make
up Betty Blowtorch open Are You Man
Enough? —— their first full length album
— with their twisted impression of a
rock anthem, “Hell on Wheels.” After
the first guitar riff hits and drummer
Judy Molish sets the pace, lead singer
Bianca Butthole shouts, “Hello USA!
We’re from Hollywood!” Don’t let her
femininity fool you. “Hollywood”
sounds more like it came from the back
of Johnny Rotten’s throat than from a
slight brunette.

By the third song, a tasteless num-
ber called “Size Queen,” featuring
Vanilla Ice, the album switches from
pop to punk and settles on metal. The

pin STIIIIEN IIIGIIIJNTE TIGKETS!  

Quit pulling your   dterms!
nop 3. bus downtown, a.nd  

 

THE PITT NEWS

wall of relentless guitar noise pushes the
album past traditional pop, but two-part
harmonies and catchy melodies leave
Blowtorch short of truly heavy heavy
metal.

The variety of sounds keeps Man
Enough fresh, while the lyrics, which
skip profound to embrace profane, keep
the album entertaining. When
Blowtorch plays “Shut Up and F————,”
it’s hard to imagine this is a band that
takes itself seriously.

After recording the demo, Get Oﬁ‘,
produced by Guns n’ Roses bassist Duff
McKagan, Blowtorch signed with indie
record label Foodchain. A year later,
they released Man Enough.

The album has seen moderate suc-
cess. A spot on the Vans Warped Tour
and a scene in “The Bubble Boy”
brought Betty Blowtorch closer to the
spotlight.

Blowtorch is on tour this October
on the West Coast, but the girls have
pondered a trip as far east as Pittsburgh
in November. 4

Blowtorch won’t come on stage
witha message, and when they come to

town, don’t look for them at the Lilith

Fair.

Monday
night foul
up on ABC  

Three consecutive losses to St. John’s, Georgetown and
Virginia Tech forced Chris Beerman to restructure his volley-
ball tearn’s offense for the second time this season.

Beerrnan made his first modiﬁcation against Georgetown a
week ago, and now he implemented this season’s second alter-
ation: the 6-2 offense.

A 6-2 offense arranges six hitters and two ‘setters in the
rotation. Setter Carrie Norris will be placed into a new role of
hitter and setter, while freshman Lindsay Macke will make her
ﬁrst appearance as the second starting setter.

In Pitt’s new strategy, opponent blockers and hitters will
have to worry about three front row defenders for the Panthers
instead of the conventional two.

Beerrnan commented on the beneﬁts of new scheme. “It is
difficult to defend and provides our protection with a better
numeric matchup,” he said. -

The 6-2 situates three freshmen in the starting roster, and
made its debut over the weekend at Fitzgerald Field House
against Connecticut and Boston College, and last night against
Youngstown State. ‘

But even with the new look, the team lost two out of its last
three matches.

Coming off an almost ﬂawless performance against Boston
College, the Panthers (6-10 overall, 3-4 Big East) wanted to
keep the momentum ﬂowing against the Youngstown State
Penguins (9-8), but couldn’t pull out a victory as they lost 3-2.

Agredano scores four goals in two games

CHRIS PAPST & KENNETH PAUL
The Pitt News

Pitt’s women’s soccer team traveled to

the No. 24—ranked University of Miami 

weekend desperately needing a win. After
losing their last three games and possibly
seeing their post-season hopes dwindle
away, the Panthers needed a spark

Senior midﬁelder Katrina Shibata pro-
vided that spark when she scored with six
minutes remaining to complete a 2-1-come-
back victory. This marked the Panthers ﬁrst
victory on the road and kept their postseason
hopes alive.

Quickly after getting its ﬁrst road victo-
ry, Pitt claimed its second victim on the road
by trouncing St. Francis (Pa.), 4-0, behind
three goals and an assist from Annette
Agredano.

Pitt 2, Miami 1

A defensive battle raged on early in
Coral Cables, Fla., as the Panthers and
Hurricanes struggled for control of the
game.

Miami’s Laura West took advantage of
an open net, scoring her ninth goal of the sea-
son. The goal, which came at the 23 minute,
55 second mark, gave the Hurricanes the
early lead in the ﬁrst half. Britney Butcher
and Anik Huffman assisted West’s goal. The
ﬁrst half ended with the Hurricanes leading
1-0.

The Hurricanes maintained the lead for
more than 40 minutes, until Pitt redshirt
sophomore forward Agredano scored her
fourth goal of the season in the 62nd minute.
Freshman Jacqueline S Reuter assisted

Agredano for her ﬁrst assist and ﬁrst point of .
her yotmg career.

Agredano’s goal was the ninth of her
career, tying her with Charity McClure for
third place on the Panther’s all—time list.

The intensity of the game continued to

THE PITT NEWS

escalate as the end of the second half
approached. With six minutes left in the
game, an unassisted Shibata scored her sec-
ond goal of the season to give the Panther’s
the late lead. The Hurricanes’ desperate
attempt to tie the game failed as the Panthers
scored the victory. _
The Hurricanes outshot tl1e.Pantl1ers 17-

V 11, but senior goaltender Rachel Brown kept

the Panthers in the game with eight saves.

Agredano led the team with two shots
on goal, increasing her team lead in shots to
28.

West led Miami with four shots on goal
as Lisa Gomez and Huffman chipped in
with three apiece. .

The Panthers return to action Tuesda

4 p.m. ’

Agredano sing1e—handedly dominated
St. Francis (Pa.) on Sunday. She was
involved in all four of Pitt’s scores -
Agredano netted three goals and an assist in
the victory. ‘
Agredano’s ﬁrst goal came quickly as
she headed a ball off of a corner kick, past
Red Flash goa1keeperAllison Tidball. Cande
Ruiz-Bradbury and Kimberly Sturk assisted
the goal, which came after just ﬁve minutes.
Agredano’s second goal came minutes

later when she blasted the ball past Tidball '

from 8 yards out. The score, which soared
into the top right comer of the net, was assist-

' ed by freshman Cara Senger. The assist was

her ﬁrst collegiate point of her career.

Pitt put the Red Flash out of the game
for good, scoring two times in a span of less
than 30 seconds before the half concluded.
Agredano scored her third goal at the 43:53
mark from 15 yards out. Midﬁelder Lauren

son by assisting on the goal. .

Agredano tied the Pitt record held by
McClure for most goals in a half. Her seven
goals are tied for fourth for the most in a sea-
son by a Pitt player, and her 12 career goals
are only second to Ruiz—Bradbury’s 17.

Pitt outshot the Red Flash 143 in the
ﬁrst half and 20-8 overall. Goalkeepers
Brown and Gretchen Ross combined for the
shutout.

match. _

“We did everything in our power to
help Youngstown State win, and they got
what they wanted,” he said.

The Panthers started the game off
with a Nonjs put-away and two Wendy
Hatlestad aces. Midway through the
game the Penguins tied the game, but the
Panthers answered with. ﬁve consecutive
points, making the score 14-9.

The first game was extended because
Youngstown State tied the game at 29.
Pitt advanced with a block and a missed
opportunity by Youngstown, defeating
the Penguins 33-31.

The teams battled for the lead in the
second game, with no lead greater than a
two-point difference in the score. Despite
kills from Hatlestad, Norris, Gini Ullery
and Abby Fechhelm, the women lost 30-
28 on a Youngstown State put—away.,

Game three began with the Panthers
taking an 8-4 lead off Hatlestad, Norris
and Fechhelm terminations as well as a
few net violations on the Penguins.

Youngstown State displayed a relent-
less effort and tied the game at 29, which
sent the game into extra points... The

Penguins went ahead, but a Fechhehn
kill and a Hatlestad ace put the Panthers
in the lead. Ullery pulled out the victory
on a put-away as the Panthers took the
third game 34-32.

The fourth game belonged to the

Penguins, who took a seven point lead
halfway through to make the score 23-
16. The Penguins scored ﬁve consecutive
points with ease and were intenupted
only onceby a Fechhehn put-away, win-'
ning 30-21. ' »
g In the ﬁfth and deciding game, the
Panthers took a 5-1 lead. The persistent
Penguins retaliated and evened the score
at 14. But after a Panthers’ ball violation
and a missed attack, Pitt fell in the
tiebreaker, 17-15. A

At the end of the match, an outraged
Beerman met with the team behind
closed doors. When he adjoumed, no
players came back out onto the court, and
he slumped down into a seat to vent his
discouragement with the team.

“We played unfocused,” Beerman
sighed. “We reverted to the way we
played before, and I’m taking tomorrow

off because I can’t bear to look at them. I I
just need to get away for a day because I '

am devastated right now.”

Where are the Dallas fans now?

Column, page 13

and soon got the ntarting job after Jeff
George got the axe.

He had a chance for revenge against his,

old team, his team of two preseason games,
and if there’s any team the Redskins have
the best chance of beating, it’s the Cowboys.
After all, the only rushing touchdown the
Cowboys have scored was accounted for by
placekicker Tim Sedar.

In the end, Banks couldn’t get that
vengeful win or much of , anything else
going. The Cowboys won 9-7, but neither
team looked good all night. The kicker for
each team missed at least one very short
ﬁeld goal with touchdown-machine Sedar
missing two.

In Sedar’s ‘defense, his equilibrium

may have been knocked out of whack by a
pre—game horse attack There’s a sentence I
never thought I’d write.

In my mind, this is how it should
always be. Not the horse attacks, but rather
how the bad guys should never win. Dallas
always overspent and bought the best talent,
and with the moral standing of that talent,-
most of them should be as familiar with a
jail cell as they are with a football ﬁeld.
Washington picked up on Dallas’ idea last

season.

But for the most part, Dallas and
Washington players didn’t do hard time,
and the wins followed. The Cowboys ruled
the ‘90s."Ihe Redskins tried to get back to
their winning ways of the ‘90s last season
by doling out the cash, but it blew’ up in their
faces. ,

So these teams are paying for past
spending indiscretions and they should con-
tinue to do so for quite some time. The
salary cap snapped Redskins should be
stuck in the basement for years to come.
With Dallas owner Jerry Jones making

more personnel decisions like the drafting-
.of Carter three or four rounds ahead of
where he should’ve been picked, the ‘Boys A

should follow suit.

That’s ﬁne with me. I don’t think I’m ~

going to take any heat from Dallas fans,
since there don’t seem to be many around
anymore. Where did all those blue stars go?
As for Washington fans, it’s too bad you
have an owner who has doomed your team.

I thank both your teams for giving me
something to laugh about in this hectic
week.

Miami, West Virginia and Virginia Tech get to rest

Teleconference, page 13

the end of the game that we have some get-
ting better to do,” head coach Frank Beamer
said. - ' i

The Hok_ies led by three scores at one
point in the game.

Next on Virginia Tech’s schedule is
Syracuse, and Beamer is certainly not look-
ing past the Orangemen.

“Syracuse’s stock certainly went up

- when they beat Auburn, and then Aubum
goes and beats Florida,” Beamer said. “They

have won ﬁve in a row and they are on a
roll.”

Pitt looks improve at Boston College

Pitt (1-4, 0-2) goes to Boston College
after a 42-10 defeat at the hands of Syracuse.

“We were very competitive for a half,”
said‘ head -coach Walt Harris. “We had a
chance to really make things happen, but we
were still plagued with turnovers and mis-
takes. When you do that it makes it diﬂicult
Our second-half performance was very
mystifying because we were ahead at half-
time, 1'0-7. We have got to overcome our-
selves.”

Harris was questioned about whether
or not the quarterback controversy had any-
thing to do with Antonio Bryant’s slow start

“I don’t think it has anything to do with
it,” Harris said “Both quarterbacks know
where his adjustments are. One may throw it
a little harder than the other, but they basi-
cally are pretty much the same in that way.”

Harris welcomes the challenge that
Boston College (4-2, 2-1) will present.
Boston College is coming off of a 34-20 loss
to Virginia Tech.

“Boston College ran into a tough game
there in Virginia Tech. We know they are a
good football team,” Harris said.

Eagles coach Tom O’Biien said, “We
helped [Virginia Tech] out and we didn’t

‘need to help them out They are a good

enough football team.”

Syracuse hosts Temple

Syracuse (5-2, 2-0) comes into its game
with Temple winning its last ﬁve games.

After beating Pitt 42-10, the
Orangemen face Temple (2-3, 1-1), who
beat Rutgers 30-5. Syracuse beat Rutgers
2417 two weeks ago.

Temple coach Bobby Wallace said,
“We made a little progress offensively
Saturday. We were able to run the football a
little bit better. I think it helped our oﬁense. I
think our defense had its ﬁnest game so far
this year.” .
