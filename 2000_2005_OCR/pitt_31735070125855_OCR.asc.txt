U8. bombs A ghanistan

Offensive targets key political, religious sites

THOMAS E. RICKS & VERNON LOEB
The Washington Post

WASHJNGTON — The U.S.-led air
strikes in Afghanistan Sunday were aimed
at crippling the ruling Taliban militia’s small
but wonisome air defenses, punishing that
regime for supporting terrorists and under-
cutting its ability to defend itself agar’ 'nst
rebel forces, Pentagon officials said.

"V The ‘ﬁercest part of Sunday’s opening
raid was concentrated on the training camps
associated with Osama bin Laden’s global
terrorist network Those camps in the val-
leys of eastem Afghanistan were ﬂattened in
concentrated B-52 strikes with hundreds of
O, -style unguided “iron” bombs, officials
said. '

Sunday’s relatively small but focused
strikes, involving 40 aircraft and 50 cruise
missiles, was the ﬁrst phase of what
Pentagon officials say will be a sustained
operation. Another round of bombing was

being readied Sunday night that could strike
targets associated with the leadership ‘of the
Taliban, oﬂicials said. .

“The effectwe hope to achieve through
these raids  is to create conditions for sus-
tained anti-terrorist and humanitarian relief

operations in Afghanistan,” Defense

Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a
Pentagon news conference. - ,

Rurnsfeld appeared to conﬁrm that
there are a small number of U.S. troops now
inside Afghanistan. Asked directly,
Rurnsfeld said he disliked discussing cur-
rent operations and that there were not “sig-
niﬁcant nmnbers of U.S. military on the
groimd.”

Other oﬂicials have said that roughly
50 Special Forces troops specializing in liai-
son and reconnaissanceare working with
the rebels of Afghanistan’s Northern
Alliance, but until now the oﬂicials have
said those troops have operated in neighbor-
ing Taj 

In an unusual departure from military
practice, the U.S.-led air campaign will
employ a novel strategy of combining com-
bat attacks with relief operations. Air Force
C-17 transport jets were poised to begin ﬂy-
ing from Rarnsteirr, Germany, to begin
dropping thousands of packets of food
inside Afghanistan — a move aimed at alle-
viating the emerging humanitarian crisis
and winning the hearts of the Afghan peo-
ple. A

“It’s.the ﬁrst time I’ve ever heard of try-
ing to feed the people while you’re trying to
destroy their government,” said Rep. lke
Skelton, the ranking Democrat on the
House Armed Services Committee and a
student of military history. “I don’t think it’s
ever been done before, but I think it’s an
excellent strategy.”

The strikes mixed naval forces in the
Arabian Sea and bombers ﬂying from the

Defense consultant
analyzes the attacks

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

James Jacob, a consultant for the
Department of Defense, was in a meet-
ing when the first plane hit the World
Trade Center.

Someone came into the room and
said, “Sometimes the things we talk
about happen even as we speak,” and
turned on the television where Jacob
watched the second plane explode.

Jacob, a political science professor
at California State University,
addressed an audience comprised most-
ly of law students in the Pitt Law
School’s Templitz Court Room at noon
Friday.

“What happened on Sept. 11 is
something none of us will ever forget,”
Jacob said. “It represented, truly, the
first event of its magnitude since Pearl
Harbor.” P

Jacob has been a consultant for the
Defense Department for more than 20
years as a specialist in terrorism and
Arab vs. Western values.

“There is a real danger to the United
States and the values it stands for,” he

said. “But there is also a very real
opportunity.”

Jacob spoke about the causes of
Islamic extremism and possible solu-
tions to terrorism, including the reasons
why America is hated by some Islamic
extremists. Most of the cause, he said,
has to do with the United States’ pres-
ence in the Arab world, such as Israel
and Saudi Arabia.

Students arrived early for regis-
tration and as the lobby rapidly
filled with new members, nervous
chatter could be heard from every
direction. Students asked one

U.N. ambassador calls recent  

terrorism an attack on the world BARTENDING

KATIE LEONARD
The Pitt News

United Nations Ambassador
Jargalsaikhany Enkhsaikhan of Mongolia
visited Pitt last week, bringing with him a
Mongolian perspective of the Sept. 11 ter-
rorist attacks and the effects of globaliza-
tion.

“We believe this act is an attack not

only against New York or Washington or’

the U.S., but it is an attack on the world
community at large,” said Enkhsaikhan,
referring to the United Nations’ formal
response on Sept. 12.

Since the attacks, the United Nations
passed several resolutions allowing the
United States and other members to take
action against terrorism within 90 days.
These resolutions instruct member states
on how to ﬁght terrorism and what mea-
sures they should take along with explain-
ing what different world organizations’
roles should be.

The resolution also enacted chapter
seven of the United Nations’ charter,
which “empowers the Security Council
and member states to take decisive
actions.” These actions include embar-
goes or blockades, but if they fall short the
Council can then’ call for the use of force.

“Hopefully, within 90 days the mem-
ber states will be able to take decisive
action to close all the routes, and possibil-
ities for terrorists to continue their illegal
operations,” he said.

As of now, there has been no dis-
agreement on the course of action within
the United Nations, including none from
member state Iraq. But Enkhsaikhan said
that this could change.

In the past, the United Nations tried
to take action against Osama bin Laden
and his followers, but the missions have
failed.

In 1999 the United Nations demand-
ed that bin Laden be turned over to prop-

er authorities, and in 2000 the group
called for the Taliban “to act swiftly to
close down -all training camps.”

The fact that the United Nations does
not officially recognize the Taliban and
that there was “no direct evidence leading
to bin Laden” in the previous attacks,
makes these resolutions more difﬁcult to
see through.

Enkhsaikhan also took part in a panel
discussion during his visit concerning the
effects of globalization on less-developed
countries such as Mongolia.

Joining him on this panel was a for-
mer Mongolian government ofﬁcial, Bat
Erdene; Betsy Nettelbeck, who served the
Peace Corps in Mongolia for the last two
years; and Seth Spalding, a former Pitt
professor.

Enkhsaikhan discussed the chal-
lenges faced by ‘Mongolia as a landlocked
nation surrounded by China and Russia.
Its economy has suffered from the costs
of transportation through the two border-
ing nations. _

According to Enkhsaikhan, “We’re
spending 3.4 times as much more [for
transportation] than for the national
defense.”

Mongolia is in what he described as a
state of transition, going through various
economic and political changes.

The panel discussed" several possible
solutions to promoting Mongolia’s econ-

‘omy.

Improving the travel industry was
one of the solutions offered.

“Especially with young people, inde-
pendent travelers haveincreased tremen-
dously,” Nettelbeck said._

The panel saw globalization as a
potential threat to the culture of
Mongolia.

“Mongolians have their own culture,
and if we lose out on it there will be no
difference between Mongolians, Russians
and Chinese,” Enkhsaikhan said.

Reaction to attack not black and White

Defense, page 2

Jacob drew a distinction between
short- and long-term proﬁling positions
and between ethnic screening at airports
and racial profiling’ in law enforcement.

“We have a system of law enforce-
ment in this country that is not color

blind,” Jacob said. “I’m obviously not

in favor of that.”

He referred to some areas of the
country where a person could be pulled
over for “the great crime of driving
while black.”

“I think [ethnic screening at air-
ports] is morally right in the short run,”
Jacob said. “In the broader sense  I

think it’s morally wrong.”

Jacob also brought up other legal
security issues such as the United
States’ ban on assassinations, of which
he said, “There are exceptions to that
that are large enough to drive a truck
through.” .

Moderator Jules Lobel, a Pitt law
professor, also commented on the fear
of a loss of civil liberties and privacy.

“We have to be very, very careful,

as President Bush said  to not target ‘

Arabs,” Lobel said.

“There is _a level of electronic sur-
veillance unlike anything you could
ever imagine,” Jacob said, “even in sci-
ence-ﬁction novels.”

Reserve, guard students
prepare for active duty

Students, page 1

whom serve as members of the
National Guard and Armed Forces
Reserves, receive educational beneﬁts
related to the Montgomery GI Bill.

Kreiling stressed that the number
included only students, receiving GI
beneﬁts — which apply only to veter-
ans — and does not account for other
students who are members of the
National Guard and Reserves. The
potential number of students that a
more extensive call-up might affect is
muchlarger, Kreiling said.

According to the Defense
Department, as of Oct. 5, the federal
government has activated more than
25,765 Ready Reserve and National

Guard members of the total 50,000’

authorized by President George W.
Bush after the terrorist attacks in New
York, Washington and Pennsylvania.

Thus far, the call-ups have targeted
specialty ﬁelds, including law enforce-
ment, security, medical, supply, intelli-
gence and other specialties. But a more
extensive activation could mean that
more Pitt students who are Reserve and
National Guard members will soon see
action.

Bush’s Sept. 14 authorization
called for National Guard and Reserve
members to provide services such as
“port operations, medical support,
engineer support, general civil support
and homeland defense.”

The most recent mobilization of
this scale occurred, during Operation
Desert Storm, when 265,322 National
Guard and Reserve members were
called to active duty.

According ‘to Nathan Agens, a Pitt A

student and member of the 128th
Forward Support Battalion of the
National Guard, the specialized nature
of current call-ups make an immediate
mobilization unlikely for him.

His battalion provides -logistical
support, such as food, ammunition,

medical aid and maps to other divisions .

once they have been deployed.

Not until the situation escalates sig— —

niﬁcantly, Agens said, would the 128th
mobilize. ' .

“I doubt if we’re going to go,” he
said. “We only goif everybody goes.”

Other students and guardsmen who
work in the University ofﬁce of veter-
ans’ affairs shared the sentiment, say-
ing it’s a pack—the-bags-and-wait situa-
tion. .

“Your involvement will assist

you in strengthening your commit-

ment to academic excellence, grow-

Fighters bomb
Taliban’s
spiritual home

‘Attack, page 1,

Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia and
from a base in Missouri. Four U.S. surface
ships, a U.S. submarine and a British sub-
pounded Afghanistan with
Tomahawk cruise missiles in attacks that
began at 12:30 EDT. The surface ships
were two Aegis destroyers, the USS McFall
and the USS John Paul Jones; a Spruance-
class destroyer, the USS O’Brian; and an
Aegis cruiser, the Philippine Sea.

Defense oﬂicials said 15 Air Force
bombers — B-ls and B-52s ﬂying from

Diego Garcia and a pair of B-2 “Stealth” ‘

bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base,
near Kansas City — dropped conventional
and precision-guided bombs on numerous

' targets. Heavy strikes were reported in the

 capital of Kabul and the southern
city of Kandahar, the Taliban’s spiritual
home. —

‘The B-ls and B-52s concentrated on
attacking terrorist training camps, pounding
them with 500-pound, Mark 82 unguided

- “dumb” bombs from a high altitude. The B-_
2s each carried 16 2,000-pound Joint Direct

Attack Munitions, precision weapons guid-
ed to their targets by Global Positioning
System satellites; these bombs hit early
Warning radars operated by the Taliban and
some military headquarters, oﬂicials said.

All of the bombers landed safely on
Diego Garcia, but the B-2s were not sched-
uled to conduct additional strikes. No air-
crafr were damaged during the strikes, and
no Afghan aircraft ﬂew in response to the
strikes, officials said.

The heavy bomber force was joined by

. 25 F-14 Tomcats and F-18 Homets from

two aircraﬁ carriers in the Arabian Sea, the
USS Enterprise and the USS Carl E.
Vinson. Other naval aircraft ﬂew electronic
jamming and combat air patrol missions. ‘
Richard B. Myers, the new chairman

' of the Joint Chiefs of Staﬁ‘ called the strikes

“the early stages of ongoing combat opera-
tions.” ” f _
Both Rumsfeld and Myers stressed that
Sunday’s engagement included operations
beyond the bombing and missile strikes that

V Myers sad “may not be so visible.”

Rumsfeld said “covert” aspects of the
attacks were designed to gather intelligence
“that will enable us to be more precise in
what we do, and to force people to move
 change-what they’re doing.” Other ofﬁ-
cialssaid that one purpose of the ﬁrst wave
of strike was to see how bin Laden and his
associates reacted —— that is, where they
took refuge, how they communicated, and

how they moved. That data is likely to be

used in additional strikes in coming days,
the oﬂicials said.‘

Persistence under fire

It happened.

After three weeks of anticipation,
American and British forces attacked the
Taliban with missiles and bombs yester-
day afternoon.

Although we knew the attacks were
coming, no one knew when. Yesterday
many were watching KDKA’s Steelers
pre-game show one minute and bombs
falling over Kabul, Afghanistan, the next.

But within an hour, the Steelers were
back on and viewers had only missed a
few minutes-of the game.

Perhaps some immediately ﬂipped to
all-news networks. Many others surely
continued spending their Sunday after-
noon watching football as they had
already plarmed.

In the days, weeks and months ahead,
our country will be at war. Many people
our age have found their lives already
altered and some are facing call-ups to
active duty.

But we must continue living our lives
as normally as possible. There will be
some changes to our daily routines, but
we must not lock ourselves in our homes.
Although the country mobilized itself on

' a mass scale during World War II, people

still lived their lives in much the same
way as they did before Pearl Harbor. We
must do the same.

Whether we agree with military
action, we must support our soldiers.
They are common people who deserve

our support. We are thankful that the
University has accommodated enlisted
students by allowing them to enroll again
when they return with their previous
financial aid.

In_his speech following news of the
attacks, President George W. Bush was
quick to emphasize that this war is on ter-
rorism, not the Afghan people or Islam.

We must remember that. Those who
attacked New York and Washington were,
as Bush rightly reiterated, blasphemers of
Islam who in no way represent the major-
ity of followers of this peaceful religion.
We must also remember that our war is
against the Taliban, a government that
only Pakistan considers legitimate. We
must avoid generalizing the Taliban as
being representative of Afghanistan.

Bush has gained a reputation in the
past for mistakes in his speeches, but yes-
terday’s was his best ever. He emphasized
his point about the war being on terrorism
itself and said that the United States
intends to follow through with humanitar-
ian aid, not just leaving the Afghan people
to suffer the consequences of their
oppressive rulers’ actions.

So the time has come. We must be
ready for a long war on terrorism. But we
must still live and thank those working to
fight terrorism, those who are letting us
continue to live our lives. If we don’t per-
sist, we’ll already have lost part of the
war.

It’s time to bring back quality cartoons

Eighties cartoons kicked so much ass. They

ﬁghting such great named villains as Vultureman,

I barely remember anything about

I quickly became an ‘80s cartoon
fanatic; watching every cartoon I could
instead of trying to talk to people.
When I was all grown-up, I was educat-

the heroic decency of “Scooby Doo”
and the homosexual tendencies of the
“Silverhawks.” Those cartoons made
me the ﬁne upstanding gentleman I am
today, a gentleman who sometimes
plucks out his pubes just for the hell of

Columnist

“Visionaries,” knights with animal holo-
grams on their chests, except that when I
watched the show my brain would shoot
off so many endorphins that I’d nearly
poop myself.

' After watching all these high cal,-
iber ‘80s cartoons, I ﬁnd myself quite
irritated when I‘see today’s. What hap-

~ pened? First, there’s an incredible lack
of cartoons for kids. Talk shows are now
taking up what used to be cartoon prime-

it.

They had really scary bad guys like Skeletor,
Mumm-Ra and Megatron who gave me horrible
nightmares where they were eating my face off and
the only thing I could dowas say “pancakes.” Man,
I was a weird kid. ’

The main reason I liked these shows so much
was their plots. “Transformers” was about futuristic
robots from the planet Cybertron who come to
Earth to ﬁght each other for some reason. I fell in
love with that hunk Optimus Prime, the robot ver-
sion of Fabio. I totally wanted to do him. A

“He-Man” was about more weird stuff on some
weird planet. .

“ThunderCats,” easily my favorite, was about
cat-people whose planet Thundera was destroyed
by the heinous Mumm-Ra, a freakish super-pow-

time. Do we expect kids to watch
“Montel Williams?” That’s torture. .

Second, the cartoons around today blow meaty
chunks of useless crap. It’s not like Nickelodeon is
inspiring today’s youth with that moron
“SpongeBob SquarePants.” I’m sorry to be the one
to break this to you, Mr. Cartoon Network, but all
your shows .sure suck a lot.‘

Still, the most popular cartoon today is
“Pokemon.” This sappy Japanimation revolves
around geekface Ash Catchem and his journey to
catch all the little pokemon. He’s not exactly
“Bionic Six” material. I guess one could make the
argument that kids relate to him more, but I still
think he’s a total wuss. The worst part of every
episode is when everyone cries and hugs each other.

“Digimon” is the Fox Network’s shameless

knockoff of “Pokemon.” I don’t know why anyone
would want to copy something already so stupid,
but after “Charlie’s Angels” the movie, I guess it’s

I not so surprising. Those TV execs should get their

testicles ripped off with a melon baller for having
such an obvious lack of creativity. And who com-
posed that theme song? A dead cow?

Parents don’t bring-up children — cartoons do.
My generation was nurtured to goodness with every
type of cartoon from “Centurions” to “My Little
Pony.” Now we’re left with the nauseating nasal
stylings of “Life with Louie.” Cartoons today are so
sugar-coated that they teach nothing about real life.
If today’s kids get in a ﬁght at recess, they’ll just
think they can crawl back into their pokeballs an
regenerate that tom-off limb. P

We’re rearing a crappy generation of clueless,
uncreative pussies. If this epidemic continues,

We’re all screwed when we hit retirement-home»

age. The high standards set by cartoons from the
‘80s must be revived if the human race is to sur-
vive. If we start beating up our younger siblings
like we mean it, I think we can reverse some of
what I call the “Pokedorkiﬁcation” done to them.
We should also petition to have a channel that

only plays reruns of “The A-Team” and “Alf.” I
know they aren’t cartoons, but it couldn’t hurt. ‘

A Ben Rubin wants Carrot Top to know that one day

he will kill him for making those I-800-COLLECT

commercials. Don’t act like you don’t deserve it,
r you annoying douche.

Getting in touch with yourfeminist side

Man hating, hairy-legged and
angry as hell.

Is this your deﬁnition of a femi-
nist? If so, don’t be afraid to join the
club. The term has become so loaded
with negative connotations that nor-
mally forward-thinking people are
loath to identify themselves with it.

Considering the prevalence of
these stereotypes, a working deﬁni-
tion of feminism is necessary to
understand why it’s still important.

Merriam—Webster Collegiate
Dictionary deﬁnes feminism as “the
theory of the political, economic and
social equality of the sexes.”
Equality of the sexes. ‘

- At this point in time, don’t we all
— theoretically, at least — agree
with this? Past third grade, do we
walk around saying “Girls are better”
or “Boys are better” and mean it?

It seems like equality of the sexes
is a theory most of us can get right in
line with.

In fact, this theory is so agreeably
abstract that it’s easy for some to
think that today the sexes are equal.
For example, most of our moms work
— or at least could if they wanted to
— and families these days often have
Mommy cooking while Daddy does

the dishes, or vice versa. If this is the
case for you, then contemporary fem-
inism may seem like a frivolous
waste of energy. Feminists may even
appear sexist themselves, convinced
that men are inferior, determined to
turn the tables on them.

It happens that there’s an easy
place to verify whether this is the
case: your television. Turn it on and
don’t change the channel at the com-
mercial break. How many of the ads
are focused on women’s bodies and
attractiveness? Even the commercials
that aren’t selling beauty products or
clothes —— items like beer, cars, and
snack foods -.— readily make use of a
woman’s shape to sell.

One might argue that there have
been ads that make use of men’s bod-
ies as well. But this is a moot point.
Exploiting the bodies of both sexes
doesn’t make the exploitation itself
any more acceptable, and the truth is
that women are far more frequently
objectiﬁed. ,

Think I’m overanalyzing? Let’s
take a look at theworkplace, where‘
apparently the feminist’s job is ﬁn-
ished. Women are routinely paid less
—'_roughly three quarters of what a
man earns for the same amount of

work.

Then there’s the ugly truth that
professional women are routinely
passed over for promotion because of

that lingering belief -that men make,

better leaders. For personal proof, try
asking your mother or another work-
ing woman you’re close to about her
experiences. I still haven’t ’

impossible.
Merriam-Webster’s second deﬁn-
ition of feminismreads, an “orga-

nized activity on behalf of ‘women’s _ .

rights and_interests.” Nowhere in that
deﬁnition does it say only women '—
let alone only man-haters — can par-
I ticipate. E

met one who hasn’t had
her gender pointed out to
her as a ‘‘limitation.’’
How about the politi-
cal arena? One can hardly
say there are equal num-
bers of men and women in
political ofﬁce, although
one might say that there’s
nothing keeping women ’
from participating more.

On the surface, “Medea” is a play about revenge.
But with the right production, it can be about so much
more —— feminism, for example.

When her husband Jason casts Medea aside-for

the young princess of Corinth, this wrong is not conw

sidered slight, and ‘her -revenge is seen as just,.even by
the gods. Considering Euripides penned “Medea” in
the ﬁfth century’ B.C., that’s pretty forward thinking.

The first thing one notices about the "Public

large, fairly simple white set by Allen Moyer dwarfs

A ﬁrst-timer at the Zenith Tea Room and
Antiques passes through three stages: denial, anger
and acceptance.

The Zenith, located at the corner of 26th_and
Sarah streets in the South, Side, is essentially three
venues wrapped into one. The antique store was the
ﬁrst installment of this triple delicacy, next a gallery
for the art section and ﬁnally the tea room. The mod-
est brick exterior could lead an outsider
to believe it’s impossible for a restau-
rant to be inside — after all, there are no
“Smiley” cookie decals or 99 cent
menus plastered on the windows.

nence.

Inside, the Zenith is a visual bombardment of
oﬁbeat art, modish antiques and pop-culture para-
phernalia. And best of all, everything is for sale.

As a Pittsburgh native, I’m disturbed —- anger
phase — that I didn’t know about this place until
recently. My Zenith experience began on a blind date,
as a carnivore dining with a vegan. Needless to say,
the blind date didn’t work out, but the relaxed yet
classy atmosphere of the Zenith inspired me to retum.

To the right, browsers can view everything from
vintage teacups to spring-mounted rocking horses to‘
an old-fashioned oven. There are even couches for
those who wish to relax and absorb the surroundings.

In another -area, visitors can ﬁnd innumerable porce-
lain vases and ﬁgurines, baby dolls in Victorian garb
and a makeshift shrine, complete with religious stat-
ues and candles. Moving to another room, collections
of women’s vintage hats and gloves, a gigantic eagle
statue and a Bart Simpson doll could keep patrons
like me amused for hours. The whole setup is enough
to make me regret ever losing that Raggedy Ann doll
— I’m still in the anger phase at this point. b V
The dining rooms’ main attraction is the Space
Monkey, a towering installation expanding from
ﬂoor to ceiling, said owner Mary Kay Morrow.
“People walk in the room and start maldng up

what they think it is,” said Morrow, who, with her

partner David Goldstein, has been in business for 10
years. “Some will say, ‘It’s a monkey!’ and others
will say ‘No, it’s an astronaut!”

According to Morrow, a vegetarian for more than
25 years, ﬂie food aspect of the Zenith attracts the
most customers. And if you spot an
intriguing antique in the Zenith, don’t
count on ﬁnding it in the same-place next
time —— Morrow also changes the decor
often to expose items that visitors may not
see.

“When you have so much stuff around, you learn
not to get attached to things,” said Morrow. “It’s a
personal problem solver for me because I’ve always
been a pack rat.”

Morrow even admits to losing items occasional-

’ ly, including part of a bed. ..

“I know it’s around somewhere,” she said, sigh-
mg. . . , .
With this admission, I’m ready to move into the
acceptance phase. Sure, I’ve lost countless artifacts
through the years, but I’m ready to put that behind me
and begin the collection anew, starting with that
Raggedy Ann doll. ‘
Now if I could only ﬁnd the thing.

’ Some people are vegetarians —— they eat eggs and dairy,
but no ﬁsh or poultry, for example. Others take vegetarianism

- to its limit and shun all animal products. They’re called veg-

ans.

I consider myself a meatatarian.

So it was with some trepidation that I perused the Zenith’s
all-veggie (and vegan with advance notice) menu when I
dined there with a couple of friends.

The Zenith’s eclectic decor canies into the dining rooms.

My group sat at a low patio table with mismatched chairs and
ﬂatware beneath a towering art installation — a copper-col-
. ored monkey that appears to

have been constructed ﬁom pan-
N O S h els of aircraft aluminum.
The short menu changes
A . weekly. When I ate at the Zenith,
a soup,.three salads, two sandwiches and two entrees com-

prised the menu.

My friends started with big cups of tasty potato-lentil
soup. The main ingredients were carefully preparect The pota-
toes were still recognizable chunks, but the lentils weren’t hard
little pebbles. The ﬁagrant broﬂi emitted a homemade ﬂavor
but lackal the richness that a potato-legume soup should have.
Also, my ﬁiends picked easy-to-choke-on bay leaves out of
their cups of soup —— an oversight the kitchen should notice.

Just‘ the Faclsi .mO,Om     

Fact Show breaks

down stereotypes

The Fact Show

Through Nov. 19

Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
(412) 361-0873

HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

Nobody can better sum up society’s ﬁx-
ation on facts better than Dragnet: “Just the
facts, ma’am.” Facts are the only sure thing,

the quick ﬁx to get us from pointA to point‘

B while sounding like we know what we’re
talking about.

Yet right now at the Pittsburgh Center
for the Arts, arts are questioning the infalli-
bility of the fact, and whether
itreallyhasthe abilityto sum
up an issue into one easily
digestible point. The viewer is
forced to ask, “Do facts really
tell us the whole truth?” and “What can’t I
learn from ‘just the facts?”’

We are immediately assaulted by these
questions the moment we enter the exhibit

Vie

Around the center’s main room on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor are 26 framed, typewritten sheets of
paper that make up Emma Kay’s
“Shakespeare from Memory.” Kay has

attempted to record her recollections of 26 l in I In 

works of the Bard, and the results range
from fairly detailed and accurate (“Romeo
and Juliet”), to not so accurate (“I-Iarnlet”
has been horribly confused), to not so
detailed (for several of the plays, such as
“As You Like It,” all Kay could remember
was a name).

While this piece may not have much
value in a literature class, in real life its

implications are interesting. What is more .  

important about a play — what actually
occurs in the play itself, or what-we _take
away from it?

On the second ﬂoor, artist Warren
Neidich focuses directly on our obsession
with facts in his piece, “Camp OJ .,” which
consists of several poster-size color prints of
“behind the scenes” footage
from the O.J. Simpson trial.
This includes stacked protest
posters, the “OJ. Desk” from
ABC and reporters preparing
for their broadcasts. The pictures are placed
against a ‘black—and-white striped wall,
while on a television, a man spins a similar-
ly painted cylinder around and around — the

The viewer hears hip-hop music even V‘

before entering another, smaller room. The

music comes from Ayannah Moor’s exhibit »

“Outa They Name,” a study on the black

community’s use of the word “nigga” On

the wall opposite the viewer are seven black
pieces of construction paper, with seven dif-
ferent uses of the term stenciled in white.
While reading the varying connotations
of the word today, a mix of hip-hop songs
that use the word “nigga” plays. This recla-

mation of the word requires an understand- ‘

ing of more than its original usage.
To understand the pieces in “The Fact

She spots him from a distance. Dark curls
cascade from his head and spring up and down as

he turns to meet her glance. The wind rushes_

They giggle to themselves and back ‘closer to the

A younger boy with the same

the three girls, jumps down and runs toward

fell apart late in:‘t.h,e.4 second half and
dropped its third straight game, a 24-7

noon. .‘   '

After __Nicholas Setta drilled a 40-

at its own,‘ 15-yard line, 1 down .10-7.

The Panthers,» led’"by -.quarter,back '

David Priestley, drove down the ﬁeld,
thanks to precise passing by the senior.
" Priestley opened the drive with a

0—yard pass over the ‘middle to.

Antonio Bryant.‘“"Two plays later,
Priestley completed another pass for a
first down, this time to fullback Joe
Vaglia, who leaked out of the back-
ﬁeld.

...\

Bryant received another pass over
the middle, which took the Panthers to
midﬁeld. The drive continued when
Priestley found R.J. English, who car-
ried several Notre Dame‘ defensemen
on his back-for a 20-yard gain.

’ The ensuing play changed the face

of the game for good as Priestley ‘-

scrambled around the pocket, dodging
Irish pass rushers. On first down at the
Irish 26-yard line, Priestley escaped
from danger and found a wide, open

“When we beat ourselves, it makes
it hard to win,” said Pitt head coach
Walt Harris. “It was a’ good effort by
R.J., but ‘he didn’t put the ball away.
It’s sad because he played so -well.”
Notre Dame head coach Bob

‘Davie said that the play was really

strange but that strange plays are part
of the game. He added. that it was
important because his tea:rn‘.has had

trouble once it has gotten behind this
season. .

Notre Dame took the lead late in
the first quarter as the Irish looked
sharp in the short game. With no run or

Irish drove 52 yards with Julius Jones

Wide receiver R.J. English’s fumble on the 1-yard line was thejjturningﬂ point in
the game for the Panthers, who were plagued by turnovers Saturday.

"KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

SOUTH BEND, Ind. —— Forget
Touchdown Jesus. Apparently the Pitt
football team vis_ited- another T.J. this
Saturday — Turnover Jesus.

The Panthers self-destructed in

I . their 24-7 loss to Notre Dame by turn-

ing the ball over five times, including
a fumble by wide receiver R.J. English
on the 1-yard line that proved to be the
turning point of the game.

With just more than six minutes
left in the third quarter and trailing 10-
7, Pitt gained possession at its own 15-
yard line. Quarterback David Priestley
orchestrated a seven-play drive that
ended with a pass to a wide open

English. It appeared he had an easy,

touchdown, but theball popped loose
just 1 yard before the end zone and
Notre Dame’s Abram Elam recovered
it.

English was not touched by any
Fighting Irish defenders, but from the
way the ball pitched forward out of his
hands, it was almost as if someone had
hit him from behind. V -

“I don’t know what happened,”
English said, shaking his head in dis-
belief. “I was, holding tight and just
lost it. I forgot my fundamentals.”

Hokies, Eagles pick up easy Wins

MATT WEIN
. The Pitt News

The Hokies continued to prove they
can win games with Grant Noel as quar-
terback as they blanked the Mountaineers
thisiweekend, and Temple put up little
ﬁght against Boston College. The only
matchup, in the Big East this weekend
that was competitive was Syracuse and
Rutgers, and that was only because nei-
ther team played particularly well.

Virginia Tech 35, West Virginia 0

Virginia Tech continued the post-
Michael Vick era with an impressive road
win at Morgantown, W.Va. The Hokies,
ranked sixth in the nation, posted" their
third’ shutout of the year as the
Mountaineers fell to 2-3. It was West
Virginia’s worst home loss since a 35-0
rout by Oregon in 1963.

Mountaineer quarterback Brad
Lewis was liﬂzed in favor of redshirt
freshman Derek Jones, who completed
just nine of 23 passes ‘for 98 yards and
two interceptions. The loudest cheers of
the day ﬁ'om the sold-out crowd came
when Lewis was benched. The
Mountaineers crossed midﬁeld just twice
the entire game and were little threat to
the Hokies. , .

Tech rrmning back Keith Bumell had

touchdown runs of 1 and 10 yards as the
Hokies improved to 5-0 in their second
Big East conference win of the season.
The Virginia Tech defense has allowed
only 24 points all season-

Syracuse 24, Rutgers 17

Syracuse avoided a loss to the str_ug- V

gling Scarlet Knights when James
Mungro caught a 2-yard touchdown pass
ﬁom quarterback R.J. Anderson with just
1 minutes, 17 seconds left in the game.

The Orangemen received help from a

woeful Rutgers kicking game. as Steve
Barone missed an extra point and was
just one of ﬁve on ﬁeld goal attempts
before the home crowd in Piscataway,
NJ. ° ~
Neither team’s quarterback played

particularly well. Syracuse’s Anderson

and Rutgers’ Ryan Cubit combined for
just 324 yards on 26 completions. The
Orangemen (4-2) have defeated the
Scarlet Knights (1-4) in 14 of their last 15
meetings. The lone Rutgers victory came
in 1999 at Rutgers Stadium.

Boston College 33, Temple 10

BC running back William Green‘

rushed for 113 yards and two touch-
downs to power the Eagles to their sec-
ond Big East win of the season. Green,

Brian St. Pierre threw two touch-

half. -

Boston College (4-1) has won three
straight games since losing to Stanford
38-22 on Sept. 8. With the loss, Temple
falls to 1-3 and is still without a confer-
ence win.

No. 1 Miami’s Heisman Trophy
hopeful Ken Dorsey threw for 299 yards
on 18 completions to help keep the
Hurricanes undefeated. Despite the ﬁnal
score, Miami did not play particularly
well against Troy State, giving up 175
yards and 12 ﬁrst downs in the ﬁrst half

’ alone.

Miami’s Clinton Portis ran foronly
18 yards on seven carries. The
Hurricanes finished with a lackluster 101
yards on the ground, the first time they
have been held to less than 200 yards
rushing this season.

Miami would have only led by four

'Rehearsal

    

KENNETH PAUL/CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

‘Standout Antonio Bryant, who has seen limited action this season because of injury, had his best
output of the year with six catches for 95 yards and a touchdown but also fumbled.

This Week’: Slueni Organiziion Meeting and Evenis

Irish pick up first
victory of season to
avoid starting 0-4

Irish, page 15

_ Irish quickly gained possession as the Panthers could not
net any positive yardage in three tries.

Facing a third down and six at its own 45-yard line,
Notre Dame wideout David Givens slanted in front of Pitt

A cornerback Shawn Robinson and caught a Holiday delivery
for 7 yards. A

Jones converted another Irish third down situation, div-
ing for 3 yards and keeping the drive alive. Confronting a
fourth down and six, Notre Dame coach Davie decided‘to
go for the first down. '

Givens came through again for Notre Dame as he ran a
similar route on the opposite side of the field. The catch
was good for 8 yards, which eventually set up the Setta
field goal to put the Irish ahead for good, 10-7.

After the long run by Holiday put Pitt in a 17-7 hole,
the Panthers still had a few chances to come back.

With a first down and the ball at its own 4'0, Rod
Rutherford forced up a deep pass that was intercepted by
Notre Dame defensive back Shane Walton. Priestley would
also be intercepted again, setting the Irish up at the Pitt 23-
yard line. '

Jones finished the Panthers off with a 1—yard run,
putting the Irish ahead by 17. _

Priestley finished completing 10 of 19 passes for 163
yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.

Bryant had his best game of the .2001 season, catching
six balls for 95 yards, a touchdown and a fumble.

Irish capitalize on Pitt errors, steal momentum

make it happen, you’ve got to make it
happen,” Pitt head coach Walt Harris
said. I

Priestley’s second interception
came with less than 10 minutes left in
the game and Pitt losing 17-7. The pick
by Anthony Weaver set up the ﬁnal
scoring drive for the Irish, who took
the 24-7 lead.

Rutherford had struggles of his
own — he was intercepted just two
series_ before Priestley’s second pick-

off. After Priestley hit Kris Wilson
with a 14-yard pass for the first down,
Rutherford took over and threw the
ball right to Notre Dame defender
Shane Walton. There were no Pitt
receivers in the vicinity because
Antonio Bryant was out of position,
although Harris said the pass was
intended for English.

“I wasn’t able to run my route,”
Bryant said.

“Rod did not execute,” Harris said.
“He was in poor position to throw.”

Bryant had another miscue in the

second quarter when he fumbled with
the score tied 7-7. This followed what

A appeared to be a fumble by Rutherford

on an attempted pitch option, but the
official ruled it an incomplete pass.

Davie was livid on the sideline, I

screaming and _ holding his nose’ and
pointing to the official while saying,
“You stink.”

“It’s hard to believe ‘an option
could be a forward pass,” Davie said.
“I have to look-at the tape but it looked
like a dropped ball.” '

While the Panthers may have beat

themselves in this game, they will not
let it affect their future.

“This team will bounce back,”
Priestley said. “We’ve all made these

"plays, it will bring us together as a

team.”- . a
‘‘I’m not disappointed, we still

have many games,” Bryant said.

Harris’ thoughts echoed those of
his players. .

“The one who makes the most mis-
takes loses, and we need to learn from

4‘ this,” Harris said. “We’re not far away,

we just need to correct turnovers.”

A Special Public Event

How Newspapers Reflect their Communities

How well do newspapers fully and fairly cover the racial, ethnic and cultural diversity of their
communities? How well do they ensure that the writers and editors represent that ‘community?

The Speaker: Lorraine Branham, assistant to the publisher, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Before joining the Post-Gazette in September 2000, Ms. Branham was a reporter and night metro

editor in Baltimore for The Sun (1981-86); an editor of Various sections at The Philadelphia
Inquirer (1987-96); and Vice president/executive editor of the Tallahassee Democrat (1996-99).

Ms. Branham will discuss her career in journalism and
share her views on diversity in the newsroom and in

the pages of American newspapers.

Tuesday, October 16, 7p.m.,
