Leticia Santo, an immigrant
worker from the Philippines, worked
at the San-Francisco International
Airport along with her two daugh-
ters. A

They were making ends meet
until regulations, implemented after
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, stipulated
that only US. citizens could be

employed as airport screeners.

Santo was promptly dismissed
from her job, and her two daughters,
who had already gained legal status,
were required to take a test to remain
employed. Both daughters failed the
test and were subsequently fired.

Following in the spirit of the

of ensuring that-everyone has access

Boarding 10 buses from various

Oakland residents hoping to grab
a Big Mac or Quarter Pounder for
lunch, Wednesday, were met with a
surprise. A

The Voices of Animal Liberation,
an animal rights’ group at Pitt, held a
“feed-in” outside the McDonald’s on
Forbes Avenue. Group members gave
out free, meatless Boca Burgers to
McDonald’s patrons and passers-by.
They also distributed
showed a graphic video about the
treatment of animals in the beef and
dairy industries on a mobile television
and held up a large banner promoting

veganism.

Timothy Adams, the group’s pres-
ident, said. McDonald’s was targeted
because the chain is “not only inher-
ently cruel to animals, but also one of
the biggest destroyers of the planet.”

literature, '

Adams also accused the chain of
taking unfair legal actions to silence
those who have spoken" against it and
of its “human rights abuses.” D

“Our intention is to interrupt their
business and give people another

option,” he said.

The group also wants to educate
people on what they claim are animal

‘abuses in the meat and dairy indus-‘

tries, and about the vegan diet.

“Hopefully, they ‘will think about
where their food comes from and the
simple lifestyle changes they can
make and the effects that [such
changes] would have,” he added.

Lori Workmaster, assistant man-
ager of marketing for the McDonald’s
company, said her company is an
industry leader in environmental
issues and employee standards.

Palestinians argue against building wall in West Bank

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

The Israeli government’s con-
struction of a wall in the West Bank,
explained as a measure of defense, is
part of a plan to break the will and
dreams of the Palestinian people,

according to two Palestinian offi-
cials. '

“The real reason for building the
wall is not security,” Fayez Audeh, a
coordinator for both the Farmers
Union in Tulkarem and the Stop the
Wall campaign, said through an inter-
preter at the Monumental Baptist

Church last Thursday, as part of the ’

Palestine Labor/Stop the Wall tour.

“This is the last bullet used by
[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon
to throw at the Palestinians,” he
added.

Sharoniled his government in
ordering the construction of a wall in
response to continued protests and
terrorist attacks from some
Palestinians in the disputed West
Bank territory of the Middle East.

“I also think the wall is a mis-
take,” said Aaron Weil, the executive
director of the Hillel Jewish
University Center, in an interview
Wednesday. “The wall is a non-her-
metic wall.’’

The wall, if completed, would
stretch the entire length of the »West
Bank, from the northern city of Jenin
to Hebron in the south. At this time,
80 percent of the wall along the bor-
der of Israel is complete, according to
Audeh. But Weil does not believe the
wall could accomplish its goal of
keeping suicide bombers out of
Israeli civilian areas. ,

Weil said new methods of attack,
such as missiles, would undermine
the Israeli effort.

According to Audeh, a wall is
also being built on the eastern side of
the West Bank, bordering Jordan.
Audeh estimated that the eastern wall
was 20 percent complete.

“That would be close to impossi-
ble,” Weil said of Audeh’s assertion.
“I question even the terminology. He
might be referring to electric sensors
 [But] it’s a ludicrous fantasy to
imagine that Israel could build what
they are describing.”

Audeh said the placement of the

wall strategically divided and isolat-
ed Palestinian regions. He added that
400,000 Palestinians remain on the
Israeli side of the wall.

He also said the wall quarantined
an important reservoir in Qalqilya
from the rest of Palestine.

“That’s not true,” Weil said. “The

reservoirs are underground.”

Weil said the water could be
tapped, -similar to the way oil
reserves are tapped, and that the wall
would in no way deny the
Palestinians access to the reservoir.

On a map of the West Bank,
Audeh showed how the wall would
divide Palestine ‘into four disconnect-
ed sections. He also questioned the
need for a wall on the eastern border
of the West Bank.

Abdel Latif Khatib, a member of
the Palestinian General Federation of

Trade Unions, also spoke through an _

interpreter at the conference.

“The recent Israeli invasion is
just a myth,” Khatib said. “It’s an
attack on the Palestinian economy,
health and education.”

I Khatib said 140,000 legal
Palestinian workers who were work-
ing in Israel lost their jobs because of
the current situation. Citinginforma—
tion from the International Workers
Union and a Palestinian statistics
bureau, he added that the unemploy-
ment rate among Palestinians rose
from 11 percent in 2000 to 78 percent
in 2003.

According to Khatib, Palestinian
financial injuries reached $4 billion.

’ He cited examples of concern, such

as the Genaid Dairy Company slash-

ing its production from 80 tons to two
tons and its workforce from 150 to 30
workers.

Khatib said Israeli—controll_ed
borders prevent resources from pass-
ing through efficiently enough to sus-

’tain business. He also said border

control damaged health service and
education in the West Bank.

“Many sick Palestinians are
dying on the checkpoints,” Khatib

said. “Many women delivered babies I

while on the checkpoint.

“Many of the workers had chil-
dren who were attending schools and
universities, but they cannot support
those children anymore,” he added.

“Sharon is implementing policies,

toward his ideal ethnic‘cleansing of
the Palestinians.”

Audeh echoed that sentiment.

“The facts on the ground show
that there is ethnic cleansing going
on,” Audeh said.

Weil said, the Israeli-controlled
borders have slowed down ambu-
lances and students, but argued that
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat,
has done more to violate the human
rights of Palestinians than any out-
side force by delaying ‘democratic
reforms and denying funding. to

Restaurant tour gives

people tastes of World

JULIE BACHALIS
Staff Writer

A group of S100 people sent their

‘taste buds on three-hour voyage

around the world last night — and
they didn’t even have to leave
Oakland. . .

The Oakland Restaurant Tour
was an anchor event of International
Week 2003, sponsored by the Office
of International Services, the
Oakland Planning and Development
Corporation, and the University
Center for International Studies.

Pitt students and graduates,
along with residents of the Oakland
community, dined their way through
Nellie’s Sandwiches, Qdoba
Mexican Grill, India Garden, Lu
Lu’s Noodle Shop and Thai Place
Restaurant. I

Some participants traveled in
club delegations, while others came
on their own.

But soon after the tour began,
strangers sat together at tables and
shared food with one another.

“Of the new anchor events of
International Week, this has been

. the most successful in bringing stu-

dents and non-students together,”
said Jamie Rayman of the Office of
International Services, who helped
organize the event.

Kelly Hoffman, who works with
the Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation, also
helped coordinate the event. She
said the corporation is interested in
increasing the permanent interna-
tional population in Oakland and
has developed more than 320 hous-
ing units in recent years.

Rayman and Hoffman said they

invited nearly 30 Oakland restau-

rants to participate in the tour. Some
restaurants said they didn’t have the
capacity for so many participants,
while others said they simply could
not afford to participate. Tickets for
the event cost $10 per person, which
meant that restaurants involved
would not make a profit from taking
part in theevent.

Most restaurant owners, howev-
er, were thinking of long-term expo-
sure.

“Our best marketing campaign

is getting our food into people’s‘

mouths,” said Chad Brooks, who

“The line goes out the door and

Pittsburgh’s support in ensuring civil

rights to immigrant workers.
Starting at the Hill House, the

Riders and their local supporters

marched to Freedom Corner at the_

intersection of Centre Avenue and
Crawford Street. Once reaching the
corner, they lit candles to inspire

"Pittsburgh to rally with them in sup-

port of immigrant workers’ rights.

Welcomed by one of the original
freedom riders, the crowd chanted,
“No justice, no peace”,

Later, at a forum in St. Benedict
the Moor_Catholic Church, the riders
shared their personal stories.

One rider cut pizza all day for a

temporary employment agency,
charging three cents per slice. ‘

Another paid a $3,000 lawyer fee
for a letter of employment that was
not needed for her to be employed.

Others told stories about their
family members being taken from
their family and deported.

Bishara Constandi, originally
from Pakistan and one of the current
freedom riders, was placed in detain-
mcnt for three months because he
was perceived as threatening —— even
though he is a legal citizen.

.“Just_ because the U.S. does not
cause immigration, [that] does not
remove it from the responsibility of
protecting [everyone’s] natural

’ rights,” Constandi said.

According to Audeh and Khatib,
the American media has not fairly
represented the Palestinian case.

Media sources disagreed on
whether the structure in the West
Bank should properly be called a
wall, as Audeh and Khatib asserted,
or a fence, as some outlets of infor-
mation have referred to it. »

Audeh said he does not believe
the physical division, whatever its
name, represents the intentions of .all
Israelis.

“I hope the circumstances would

. come out that would help the Israeli

citizens who want peace and justice,”
he said. “I believe that there is a hope
that the Israeli people will turn
against their government.”

On Wednesday, Sept. 24, 27

Israeli reserve pilots petitioned a"

higher officer, announcing their

refusal to fly missions
Palestinian territories, calling such
missions “illegal and immoral.”

Audeh and Khatib also. said
American television broadcasts only
images favorable to the Israeli stand-
point, such as footage documenting
thegiresults of terrorist attacks on
Israeli buses, without showing com-
parable images of Israeli military
actions. ‘

According to the Associated
Press, 101 Palestinians died as sui-
cide bombers in the last three years.

‘A A total of 3,337 people have died

because of the fighting in the region,
including 2,417 on the Palestinian
side, 860 on thelsraeli side and 60
Palestinians believed to be infor-
mants for Israel killed by
Palestinians.

The Israeli government defended
the construction of the barrier, saying
it would prevent Palestinian militants
from entering Israel.

“She started this place all on her

she’d never be able to do it, but she

Didar Singh has been a manager,
chef and the owner of India Garden,

adds new dishes to the menu and
tries new promotion techniques.

“I like to participate in asmany
Pittsburgh events as possible,” he
said. Singh added that he will open
a new eatery, Spice Cafe, by Oct.
15. The cafe will be located down-
stairs from India Garden, where Pub
IG used to be. Singh said it will fea-
ture fusion recipes of various inter-

Some policies should remain unstated

The University of California has
adopted a new policy banning
“romantic or sexual” relationships
between professors and their stu-
dents.

The policy took effect in July at
the university’s nine campuses.
Faculty members who disobey the
ban face sanctions ranging from rep-
rimand to dismissal. 9

Policies at universities through-
out the country vary. The most com-
mon one, and the one that has been
in place at Pitt since July, 1996,
states that relationships between
students and faculty who are direct-
ly responsible for evaluating them in
any way are prohibited, and should
such ‘a relationship arise, the faculty
member must remove him- or her-
self from any supervisory or evalua-
tive position over the student.T h e
strictest policy, in place at the
College of William and Mary, states
that no relationship can ever occur
between any faculty and any under-
graduate student, regardless of their
affiliation —— meaning a professor of
zoology can never consentingly date
an engineering student.

It seems reasonable to say that
relationships where there is such a
power —- and possibly age — differ-
ential could be less than healthy and
perhaps should be discouraged.
However, almost everyone in a uni-

versity setting is at least 18, which
means that any actions between stu-
dents and teachers are also actions
between consenting adults. Through
most of history, though, student-
teacher relationships have been
frowned upon. '
Now, making such a policy con-
crete not only adds bureaucracy, it

bestows the cachet of “rulebreak—'

ing” on an already socially question-
able pursuit.

Students who seek out sexual
relationships with teachers for the
thrill or possible gain of such a rela-
tionship — completely aside from
any genuine, healthy, romantic rela-
tionships that can and do arise —
are already operating outside the
norm. They are aware of this, and
few would ﬂaunt such a relation-
ship. Perhaps they deserve some
type of censuring from their peers or
parents, but to overtly outlaw con-
sensual sex between adults is too
much authority for a university to
assume.

Healthy relationships can and
have occurred between students and
their teachers. It’s not a university’s
place to forbid such a liason.
However, such students and teachers
probably ought to respect their posi-
tions and budding love enough to
wait until they aren’t in a power
relationship — on their own."

VAL World Farm Animals Day events

Former Steelers guard Teny Long

‘ wants to open a chicken slaughterhouse

on the North Side amid community
protests focusing on the smells, pollution
and dropping property values that his
chicken-killing business will bring with it.

In July, without proper authorization

- or legal equipment, he attempted to get a

head start and brought hundreds of chick-
ens on tohis site for killing and “process-
ing.” After a fan malfunctioned, dozens of
birds, languishing in their own waste, died
of suffocation and heat
exhaustion. Hundreds more were suffer-
ing from overheating and were throttled
and killed by hand by workers and Long
hirnse1f._ -

\Vith the gross negligence Mr. Long
showed toward the humane handling of
the chickens, it seems there would be
more outcry about the abuse the actual
chickens go through, rather than noxious
smells in the neighborhood. Apparently
not. ‘

When it comes to farm animals,
many people pretend they are invisible.
Most of us were raised eating meat, milk
and eggs and would prefer not to think
about who the animals were before their
lives were stolen from them for palate
preferences, or in what conditions they
lived before that day arrived

The fate of the slaughterhouse will be

discussed at a zoning board hearing on

Oct. 2nd —— the 20th anniversary of World
Farm Animals Day, a day dedicated to
raising awareness and reducing suffering
of farmed animals. ‘
Voices for Animal Liberation has held
events throughout the week to bring
World Farm Animals Day to people’s

attention. Today,  will attend the zon-
ing board hearing concerning Long’s
slaughterhouse plans to show their oppo-

sition on behalf of the animals who will ‘

suffer greatly in our own city if the slaugh-
terhouse is built.’

Also today, VAL will be in Towers
Lobby to hand out information and talk
with anyone interested in the animals’
concerns. Come visit between 10 am. and
5 p.m. to find out more about what each of
us can do to help lessen the great suffering
in today’s world. Public events have
already been held throughout the week,
including a feed-in event where a video
was showed depicting the desolate lives
farm animals are forced to. suffer, while
free vegetarian burgers were given out,
demonstrating that the best way to reach
people concerning a more compassionate
diet is throughtheir stomachs. ,

Outside KFC, members handed out
information about the appalling way KFC
treats its chickens.

The fact is,’humans don’t need to eat
meat, dairy, or eggs to enjoy great food or
to maintain optimal health. The decision
to eat animals or products made from
them, or to refrain from doing so, is a
choice. On’ one hand, we can add to the
level of violence and misery in this world
by eating products derived‘ from the suf-

fering and deaths of animals who are enti-

tled to their own lives. On the other, we
can add to the level of consideration, kind-
ness, and justice in this world by choosing
vegetarian fare. We may not have any con-
trol over whether Long is permitted, to
abuse animals as a business venture.
However, we can reduce suffering for

' farm animals. The choice is ours with

every ‘bite we take.

THE PITT NEWS

A month ago, my older brother
Gabe effectively ruined me by getting
married at the ripe age of 23. Already;
moments after the ceremony, friends
and relatives —— like starving vultures
— started coming up to me yelping,
“Oh golly, Ben ——-looks like‘you’re
upnext, buddy!”

Those annoying jackasses. Just
because Gabe’s taken the _plunge
doesn’t mean I’m next in line.

Besides, getting married isn’t like

‘having a bar mitzvah. You don’t turn
a certain age and spontaneously
become married, suddenly get
whisked to the synagogue to be
paraded around while getting pelted
with-rock-hard candies, everyone
drunkenly chanting the Mazel Tov

song, Grandma in the way back clap- ,

‘ping her hands like a _chimpanzee
ready to get fed bananas. No, it’s
nothing like that. I think it has some-
thing to do with women.

The scariest thing about Gabe

getting married is my mom’s sudden, _
incessant, cackling baby-craziness. In‘

the wedding guestbook, she signed:
“Love, love, love. Babies, babies,
babies.” Now that’s ﬂat-out spooky.
Her crouched, stance — with a cup at
her ear pushed against the wedded
couple’s door, assiduously listening
for the angelic sound of vaginal
secretions — has become something
of an Air Jordan—type of icon in our
family. . L
Unfortunately, one fully function-
ing baby factory isn’t enough’ for my
mother."Her thirst for grandkids can’t

‘ be sated by just one; she needs a pile

of them — a veritable army. of
chunky, slobbering babies in bootsie
outfits, spitting up Gerber carrot
mash" and‘ pooping themselves. Yes,
these thoughts melt my mother’s
unholy heart.

To reach her unreasonable objec-
tive, she’s now upped the ante for me

from, “When are you bringing a girl- '

friend home?” to “Make _me baby
now!” Any.time _I bring home any-
thing resembling a female, my moth-
erlaunches into an unremitting bat-
tery of questions for her, then antici-
patorily reaches for her listening cup.
At‘ that point, I tend to get really
aggravated, slap the cup away from
her, and yell, “Damn it, Mom,-‘Fm not
about to put a baby in her.” »
What my mother doesn’t consid-
er, what the marriage only made all
the more douchifyingly poignant, is
that I have absolutely no game. I sur-
mised I had this rare form of idiocy in
the first gradewhen I tried to tell a
girl I liked her by stabbing her in the

ass with a No. 2 pencil. We both-—

immediately started crying, but no
baby was made that day. I haven’t had

a relationship in two years, including

the time I accidentally
brushed against my
cousin’s boob one hot
Columbus Day back in
2001.

To date, the smoothest
move I have in my reper-
toire is creepily staring at
a girl at a party for a long
time, getting drunk
enough to come up to her,

  With no ladies, .it’ll be hard to satisfy Mom’s baby fetish

knows.

As I’ve learned, no
girls equal no babies.
Although I’d say I have
the crucial ingredients to
being a suitable baby-

tional, I have a pleasant
lemony scent, I like sex
with women you know,
I’m not sure there are any

then bellowing, “If you’re
such a dumb slut, how come you’re
turning me on?” I wonder if that line

lacks the inherent sensual subtleties ‘

of certain Rico Suaves, butwho

more criteria. But I’ve still

got no girlfriend. and no baby, which
results in a really irritating mother.

Sometimes I wonder —- like I

imagine many people who aren’t

maker: My wang is opera—_

ridiculously good—looking might
wonder — if I was destined to be
alone because there is no “perfect
girl” for me. I wonder if I should
accept this cruel fate and just use
masturbation as a kind of okay door
prize to substitute for not having a
wife and family. It’s times like those
when my mother tells me I am beauti-
ful, and that is a heartening thing to
hear. Then I stab her in the ass with a
pencil.

Fixing unsafe schools a noble goal —if it’s done right

Comparison is intrinsic to measurement
— we measure weight by comparing mass
to a standardized unit, and academic perfor-
mances with grading rubrics. Each of these
systems is supposedly uniform,.leading to
fairness, equity and, perhaps, a Zone diet

How, then, do we measure safety, par-
ticularly within schools? It’s simple, right?
Safety is the absence of danger, and where
safety is, danger cannot be. It may be deﬁni-
tion. through exclusion, but it was an okay
working deﬁnition. ,

A provision of the 2001 No Child Left
Behind Act has muddied the waters, accord-,
ing to a Sept 25 article in USA Today. Ir1
attempting to keep kids safe -— a noble goal

 

  
  

 

— the Act demanded that states ,
keep track of what it tenns
“dangerous schools” and give
any student who attends such a
school the option of transfer-
ring to another in their school
district. Now for the fim part:
each state, and Washington,
D.C., created its own criteria
for what constituted a danger-
ous school. In Pennsylvania,
for instance, schools are broken ,
into three size-based categories. If the*num-
ber of violent crimes at a school exceeds the
threshold for its size—category, it is termed
“dangerous.” A school above 1,000 students

I 1

or the Qt ma

can host 20 such acts before
being given the designation.

Now for the really fun
part: the crime—rates are self-
reported. Even given my ele-
mentary grasp of statistics, I
know that self—reported statis-
tics are rather unreliable in the
same way Yugos were rather
unreliable. '

As one school oﬂicial said
in the Aug. 23 edition of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “state officials
won’t be able to check the veracity of the

crime data reported by 'Pennsylvania’s 501

school districts.” '

 

So, based on shoddy, un-standardized
statistics, parents canitransfer their kids out
of dangerous schools. But here’s the prob-
lem: the plan leaves children’s academic des-

. tinies up to the parents. Parents are responsi-

ble for their children — ﬂrey probably made
them, after all. But if it is the school, not the
parent, who is at fault, why must it be up to
the parents to ﬁx it?

What’s more, only the concerned par-
ents will transfer their children out of their
neighborhood schools and into safer ones.
That introduces a weird, lurking variable into
this: parental concern, not the school district,
will determine which children will proﬁt
from these designations.

Rather than leading to an o’Ver_all rise in
safety, this program will result in a greater
disparity between schools —— some will be

safe and others will be dangerous, full of ‘
. children with unconcerned parents. Was this i

the intended result of the parental-choice
policy? Perhaps‘ the No Child Left Behind
Act should be amended to the No Child Left
Behind -— except for those with parents who
don’t care, who can’t afford to drive an extra

‘half-hour or who have no better alternative

than attending a crappy school —Act. Has a
certain ring to it, no? Pemrsylvania has a spe-
cial stake in this. It named moredangerous
schools than any other state out of the six that
reported any. Twenty—seven out of the 28
schools named are in the Philadelphia city
school district, constituting the largest con-
centration of “dangerous schools” in the

_ country. A »
. I hope that, for Philadelphia’s sake, the
state views these statistics as an honest cry

for help and gives the district proper ﬁmding..

But the Philadelphia issue raises the ques- _

tion: what do students in troubled districts
do? If safety is not an issue only for individ-
ual schools, but rather, pervadesthe entire
school system, what then? Pemrsylvania has
an answer. wait a year. Next year’s report
will be standardized, require action plans and
other methods of - coping, as ‘Jerry

. Zahorchak, deputy secretary for elementary

and secondary education, told the Post-
Still, this comes only as a reaction to an
absurd federal demand. And, rest assured,
this one ray of sanity will not affect the other
states or Washington,’,D.C. I

" If no child is to be left behind, why not

set standards on a national level? The term
“violent act” must be clearly deﬁned — one
Texas school listed rock throwing as a
weaponsviolation -- and a threshold must
beset: how many Violent acts make a school
dangerous? On top of that, there needs toibe
federal guidance for “action plans.” . |

Imposing a national program, then mak-
ing it onerous for states to implement, is the
kind of foolishness that —— at my high school
— got your ass kicked.

‘-Sydney Bergman went to school in

Washington, D. C., where all the children are
peaceable and above average. E-mail her at

Paintings by Valentin Lustig

One artist shares his View of

humanity in the rotunda of The Frick I
Art Museum. In a rich, seVen—panel,

symbolic narrative on- View at The
Frick through: Nov. '9, Romanian-
born Swiss artist Valentin Lustig
casts his Hoka-Neni, “Auntie Hoka”
in Hungarian, as the protagonist.
Hoka—Neni died in the Holocaust
along with her four children.
“Hoka-Neni: Being the History
of The Life and Deeds of The
Incomparable Hoka-Neni,
Truthfully Depicted in Seven Parts
by Her Nephew Valentin Lustig,
Painter in Zurich” is the artist’s
most ambitious work to date. Lustig,

 

 

-rated figurative imagery from

_and colorful tale —- sometimes

fence. , ‘

-with his family to Israel, where he

.art in Florence and eventually set_—

who has twice exhibited in
Pittsburgh, draws from a variety
of sources ——~ art history, philoso-
phy, theology, Western culture,
politics and" his life; He incorpo-

these disciplines and _ beliefs,
along with his memory and imagi-
nation, into the modern polyptych.
The result is a highly animated

accessible, sometimes not. It is
both a fantastic dream world and a‘
sobering account of human experi.- . ,.

Lustignever knew his aunt. A

son of parents who survived the :1

Holocaust, he_ was born‘ in!
Romania in 1955 and emigrated’

finished high school-and served in
the Israeli army. He later studied‘

tled in Switzerland, where he mar-
ried. Through “Hoka-Neni,” he

tells his response to his family’s his-

toryand his views on the world.

In an interview, the artist dis-
cussed the failure of the
Enlightenment, a theme he alludes
to in one of the panels in which a
dog is portrayed urinating on

Classical ruins.

- “It was the belief that, ultimate.-
ly, everything is explainable, every-
thing will have, sooner or later, a lit-
eral level. The unknown, the myste-
rious — which is a main focus of
interest in religion and mysticism
the Enlightenment tended to erase,”
said Lustig. “And this is the reason
why one of the failures of the

Enlightenment found its terrible,
expression in Auschwitz and many

other terrible things. Human beings
have an irrational element in them,
and_ if you tell -them there is no space
in their lives to‘1ive it out, it’s going

to, explode.” I

The work comprises the story of
the temptation of Hoka—Neni. In a
larger panel, Lustig has drawn from
sources of the “Temptation of St._

_Anthony” in art and literature; Dr.
‘ Edith Balas, curator of the exhibi-

tion,-*Eliscusses these sources in an
accompanying catalog. Balas,
Professor of Art History at Carnegie
Mellon University and Research‘
Associate at the University ‘of
Pittsburgh, is also the author of “The
Holocaust in the Painting of
Valentin Lustig.”

The pathos of Lustig’s narrative
is particularly revealed in the central
panel, in which Hoka-Neni, a house-
wife, stands dwarfed by the vast
landscape full of figures and objects
symbolizing ideology, war and
death. Powerless to the. coming
destruction, she continues her task

of rolling dough while watching the,
ominous panorama before her. She
doesnot see a gray tank or a gun
aimed directly at her.

Lustig also painted a beautiful,
lyrical landscape into the series,-
using deep blues, forest greens and
whiternoonlight. He evokes a land-
scape of the Northern European
Renaissance, having created deep,
aerial.perspective with a_ winding
body of water receding toward dis-
tant snowy mountaintops. Hoka-
Neni, a young woman, gazes into a

_ clear pool ofrwater at areﬂection of

the-moon.

The artist discussed the light and
dark aspects of his work, referring to
an allegory found in German litera-
ture of the Romantic Age about a
man who sells his shadow to the
devil .in exchange for un_limited
wealth. . 4 .

“‘Well, I’m sure I’ll arrange to
live among the people -without the
shadow,”’ said Lustig, telling the
story. J '

I “But then he finds it impossi-
ble,” explained Lustig, concluding,

-“The shadow is the allegory of fan-

tasy, for irrationalism, for the dark
side in ourselves. We have to give
him space.”

“Hoka—Neni: Seven Paintings,”
organized by The Frick Art &
Historical Center, _is compelling
both visually and emotionally. The
investment Lustig demands from the
viewer ends up paying dividends.

Bombastic -— oh so fantastic Piaystarioma

Bombastic S
Developed by Shiftk
Published by Capcom
Sony PlayStation 2

ﬁx“: 1/2 ,

Every‘ once in a while, there comes a
game that’s. so unique, you’re almost
stunned that someone had the bollocks to
make it. With half-angel, ha1f—devi1 chil-
dren running aroundon a field of dice, set-
ting off explosions.{:Bombastic’s premise
sounds less like .a puzzle game and more
like a Salvador Dali’ painting. However,
the shock quickly fades after actually
playing the game, leavingan exceedingly
enjoyable experience in its place.

The goal is to score points by walking

over — and thus rolling —— large dice and,
aligning their faces,- causing them to K

explode and possibly ignite nearby dice.
The game ends when you’re left standing
on an exploding die or the screen fills with
dice, thus leaving you no room’ to move.

"After a While, alternate rule—sets can be

unlocked that offer other options to keep
the game fresh. ’

Though it sounds simple, the game,
itself, is so complex that it takes a couple
hours of play just to get the hang of things.
Some people won’t make it through this
incredibly steep learning curve and will
throw Bombastic to the side. Others will

down that follows massive explosions.
Despite these shortcomings, most players
will come to enjoy this truly inspired
effort.

The graphics, aside from the afore-
mentioned slowdown, are simple and
clean; the cell—shaded characters exude
cuteness from every pore, offsetting the
vanilla backgrounds. In addition,
Bombastic features an incredible selection
of music to complement the vibrant explo-
sions of dice, and theﬂrolling-score dis-
play. Not many puzzle games warrant
turning your bass up, but this one will
make full use of that woofer. When your
friends wonder why it sounds like the
Fourth of July in your room, they can join

five—man melee modes. If they’re too
scared, then you’ll be free "to enjoy the
often hilarious quest mode without inter-
ruption. . ‘

No matter what your stance toward
puzzle games, Bombastic is worth at least
a rental. For ardent fans of the genre, how-

enough to take the plunge and buy a copy.
Its predecessor, Devil Dice, is already lost
in the miasmaiof early PlayStation obscu-
rity; lest history repeat itself, you’d better
get your hands on Bombastic while you
still can.

Recommended if you like
Barenaked Ladies, Phish

A mix of folk-rock explosion

,with beautiful and awkward har-

monies strung» through distinct,
plea/sxant guitar riffs that dance
through the airwaves and create toe-
tapping reﬂexes sums up the sound
of Common Rotation’s new album
The Big Fear pretty well.

Common Rotation sports a
“geek—rock” feel with harmonies
reminiscent of Barenaked Ladies
albums, and a folk-rock, make-you-
want-to-jam feel that screams
Phish. ‘ '

The_band has a Hollywood star
in Adam Busch on vocals, amusi-
cian/actor who’s pretty good at
both.

Those of you that are still bum-
ming over “Buffy” being cancelled
can take heart in the fact‘ that the
actors are still working; Adam had a
recurring role as Warren, the builder
of the BuffyBot.

Rounding out the band are
singer and guitarist Eric Kufs,
drummer Ken Beck and bassist
Mike Uhler.

Common Rotation has a slight
touch of seriousness to some of
their songs but are able to have a lot
fun as well. The majority of the
songs are much like Barenaked

In “Sit Down,” they mix har-
monies with punchy guitar riffs to
make a fun pop track. The lyrics run
through‘ rapidly much like
Barenaked Ladies’ “One Week,” but
slightly slower; -you can actually
sing along to ,“Sit Down” and not be
confused as to What exactly they are
saying. “You sit down before you
fall/ Now you know sit [down before
you fall down/ You gotta sit down
before you fall/ Now youknow you
sit down before you fall down.”

They also do a cover of They
Might Be ' Giant’s “Don’t Let’s
Start,” thatqhas a nice twist using
fiddles and folk-guitar ‘ riffs.
Covering the song seems to be a
nice “Thank you” to TMBG,
because TMBG bass player Dan
Weinkauf helped produce the album
with Brian Speiser. Common
Rotationhas also been playing some
shows on the road with TMBG.

Another track that is slightly
different is the opening track that
sounds like something, Wheatus -
remember “Teenage Dirtbag?’’ --
would do. The track titled “Indie
Rockin”’ is a fun song" about not
wanting to be labeled that has a bit
of a lo—fi sound at the start.

Label them or not, Common
Rotation plays a little bitof “geek-
rock” with a folk-funk feel, and as
odd as that sounds, it’s still pretty
good.

“Survivor: Pearl Island” pre-

event that seemed promising. Instead
of the usual “Survivor,” where contes-

this one would, ideally, bea pirate-

from host Jeff Probst. And why not?

Pirates seem to be in this year, what»

with the success ’of “Pirates ofithe

“Survivor” delivers.

The problem is that the pirate
theme takes a back seat to the show

Dynamic duo of songwriters delights

Side of the Road

Ellis _Paul and Vance Gilbert
Rounder_ Records

«ix-~a»a+  *

When bands or artists choose open-

ers lor co-headliners for their live

shows, they, dose to complement" their
music, not to: rival it. Folk singers Ellis
Paul and Vance Gilbert met each other
just that way over a decade ago. Both
rising sing'er—songwriters, they became
fast-jfriend_s. Though they have graced
the same stage countless times, Side of
the Road marks the first time that they

‘ have collaborated on an album.

They complemented each other on

stage; the album is no different. Paul’s
folky, albeit slightly high—pitched voice
meshes well with Gilbert’s deeper

sound. , Their. voices “are distinct; on V

each track‘ one sings the_ lead vocals
while the other does;.*ft_he_’ harmony
vocals.’ ,;,,jt1,‘:;i: ;,I‘} T    2:‘ ‘
‘ l_1' On Sept. 11, 200l,,Paul found him-
self wandering around his native
Boston and reﬂecting on the events. He
eventually phoned Gilbert, who came
and picked Ihir"n' up. As a result of the
tragic events of that day, the two com-
rades found ‘inspiration for the songs on
Side of the Road.

The a1bum’S_: moniker ' track, origi-
nally sung" by folk ./legend Lucinda
Williams, is so beautiful,‘.’it is almost

' haunting. Other notable cover songs are

Neil Young’s “Comes a Time,” Van
Morrison’s “Comfort You” and Slaid
Cleaves’ .“This -Moming..I Am Born

C Again.” Susan Werner,» another pre-

dominant folk singer, lends her “May I
Suggest” to the album.

,, While Side of the Road -is largely T‘
comprised of brilliantly doneremakes’

of songs that seem eerily foreshadow-
ing in hindsight, the pair penned origi-
nal tunes for the album, as well. The
most poignant example of their post-
Sept. 11, 2001, feelings is “Citizen of
the World,” a tune about the pair’s
diverse backgrounds on which they
sing, “Blue Septemberday/Sky came
tumbling down/We’re living in a world
of hate/Door1nan’s crying at heaven’s
gate.”

Some tunes are slow, mellow‘ and
sad, while others remain upbeat and
catchy. They are juxtaposed on the
album in a ﬂowing form that does not
tire the listener out. It is obvious that
they two maintain a relationship "out-
side of the studio; their chemistry is
remarkable. ~

It.isn’t everyday that two talented
friends can go into the studio and come
out with an‘ undirninished friendship,
and an album that reﬂects it. Fans of

Vance Gilbert’s and Ellis Paul’,s solo.

oration.

Tougher competition

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Wonder why you’re so grouchy
when it starts to get cold?

Marco _Carrizales‘ thinks, it’s
because of the weather in Pittsburgh
duringthe winter. I

Carrizales, a junior midfielder
on the men’s soccer team, came to
Pittsburgh from ' Missouri City,
Texas, because he wanted to com-
pete in the Big East, which is among
the top conferences for soccer.

Last year, Carrizales led Pitt in
goals (eight), points (16), shots (40)
and game-winning goals (three). So
far this year, Carrizales leads the
Panthers in shots with 16.

The Pitt News: Why did you want
to start playing soccer? -

Marco Carrizales: I started just
because it was something. that I was
exposed to ever since I was a little
kid. It was something I loved doing.

All-Star game should not decide home-field advantage

   

“This Time It Counts.”

These words made up the slogan
that was in big print in an -ad promot-
ing the All-Star game. I ran across
the ad while reading the sports sec-
tion of the Baltimore Sun the morn-
ing of the All-Star game. .

“It’s a pretty bad slogan, and I
think it’s a horrible idea,” Red Sox
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said at
an All-Star game press conference.
“When I was a little kid playing in

the street, I thought it counted then.‘

They all count” 

*Major League Baseball tried to
hype a new procedure that -did not
seem to be all that popular, especial-
ly with the players." Since" the
American League won the All-Star
game in 2003, it has home—field
advantage in the World Series.

Texas Rangers’ third baseman
Hank Blalock hit a pinch—hit, two-
out, two-run home run off Los
Angeles Dodgers closer Eric Gagne
in the bottomiof the eighth inning to
complete the American League’s
comeback victory. . .'

With the World Series right
around the corner the question is: is
this a good thing or a bad thing?

It depends on how you look at
things. There was supposedly , some-
thing at stake. Or was there? Well,
having games one, two, six and seven
played at the home of the victor is
what the;All-Star-game has come
down to. _ —

* But everybody who is on the All-
Star team does not have_home-field
advantage at stake. Look at Detroit
Tigers outfielder Dmitri Young’; the
Tigers were out of: playoff contention
in April.

I guess the game would be more

entertaining if the players took the.

«game seriously because there is
something at stake, but truthfully,
this is not the case for everybody.

So I guess, players" like
Garciaparra, Gary Sheffield D and
Jason Giambi had-something at stake
and were willing to play hard as their
teams, the Boston ‘Red ‘Sox, Atlanta
Braves and New York Yankees,

A respectively, clearly had what it took
to make a run at their divisions at the
All-Star break.

Maybe this is what Major League
Baseball was thinking when it‘ decid-
ed to change the formatthis season.

Bud Selig and company were scram-
bling around for anything to make up
for last year’s disaster, which ended
in a tie, and to make sure thatit never
occurs again. .

Well Bud, I’m not sure that this is
the answer, and many of the players
agree. ‘J
“They could have ‘not done a
thing, and last year would never hap-
pen again,” Braves closer John

Smoltz said at an All-Star game press ‘

conference. “I’m not here to bad-
mouth Major League Baseball, but
you can’t make radical changes

because one All-Star game ended in a

tie. That was just a fluke.”
Suppose that one league domi-

'nates the other league, as was the

case with the National Football
League’s Super Bowls. Until the
Denver Broncos won Super Bowl
XXXII in 1998', the National
Football Conference won 13 straight
Super Bowls over the American
Football Conference dating back to
1984.

So should one league get to host
the majority of the home games in
the World Series for several years
straight? No. Anybody who follows
sports.knows that home—field advan-

tage is aihuge boost, especially in the
playoffs. ~' V

Home—field advantage in the
World Series_ is not the solution,

. because even though the series might

not go seven games, one league
should not be able to have home—field
advantage for several years in a row.
The other reason is that every player

selected to the teams is not going to.

have the same incentives, and that

could begin a controversy in itself.
Major League Baseball needs to

find another incentive that includes

than being out in the middle of

TPN: What’s the biggest difference
between Texas and Pittsburgh?’

MC: Definitely the temperature.
There really isn’t a change in sea-
sons in Texas. It’s hot and. hotter.
[laughs] On the’East Coast, there’s a
difference in the way people act.
They’re friendlier in the South. I
think it’s because of the cold weath-

TPN: What’s your favorite sport
other than soccer?

MC: I enjoy watching basketball
and football. Actually, I pretty much
like watching any sport.

TPN: What goes through your mind
every time you get the ball?

MC: Don’t lose it. I try to play to

have fun, so I’m having fun and
relaxing. I try expressing myself on
the field. It’s a way to be creative
and do whatever I can with the ball.
Oh, and don’t get yelled at by coach.

TPN: What’s the most embarrassing
thing that’s ever happened to you
while on the field?

MC: Well, it was before we started
playing, I had to warm up. I was
younger, and this was in _a summer
league. As we were coming onto the
field, I tripped on the walk out. I
tried to just tuck and roll and kept
on going.

TPN: If we were to take a look into
your refrigerator, what would we
find?

Fitzgerald believes that Rutherford should
receive more consideration for Heisman

before the Panthers took the field in
College Station last Saturday.
“He’s not ' a big talker,”
Fitzgerald said. “But he says things
at the right time and it really
inspired us to go out there and play
a really good game, and we’re just
going to continue to follow his
lead.’’ ,
Rutherford maintained his usual
calm demeanor throughout the
press conference. The season and

Rutherford, page 15

The outstanding play of
Rutherford and Fitzgerald has made
them both Heisman candidates. But
both players are very modest
regarding the question of who
should win the Heisman.

“Well if you really want my
honest opinion, I think that you’ve
got the right team but you’ve got
the wrong man,” Fitzgerald said

when asked about being a Heisman this team’s goals are what
candidate. “Rod’s been leading us Rutherford is concentrating on now.
all year.” “When you’re having fun,

“I can’t say enough about Rod
[Rutherford] in terms of his prepa-
rations,” Fitzgerald continued.
“You don’t see him Saturday
through Friday and what he’s doing
in terms of film study, in terms of
leadership, in terms of just the little
stuff that a quarterback needs to do.
Its all through his preparation that
he’s able to do what he’s doing on
Saturday every week.”

Fitzgerald also talked about a
speech Rutherford gave the team

you’re willing to work at what
you’re doing, and I’m having a lot
of fun,” Rutherford said. “I’m will-
ing to fight through whatever obsta-
cles; I’m willing to jump through
whatever hurdles — whatever I’ve
got to do.”

Pitt has the weekend off before
taking on Notre Dame at Heinz
Field on Oct. 11. After that, the
Panthers officially begin their Big
East schedule with a game at
Rutgers on Oct. 18.
