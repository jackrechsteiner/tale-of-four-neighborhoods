‘ Steve Munrnan opened the door and saw ﬁre everywhere.
— Last Sunday around 5 am, Murrrnan, 17, was talking to a
friend at 313 Meyran Ave. .

“I was standing in the kitchen at the time,” he said. “We hear
glass break like something came through the window. It was only a
matter of 60 seconds before everything was up [in ﬂames] .”

When he opened the kitchen door, Murrman saw that the room
on the other side of the door was ﬁlled with ﬁre. He and his friend
made it out to the front of the building. - O

‘ Chris Grey was also in the house when the ﬁre started.
“A couple of kids were sleeping, some were in the back rooIn,”
he said 4

Chris Naylor, one of the tenants of 313 Meyran Ave., had win-
dows that lookedout on the ﬁont porch‘ of the house.

“[Naylor] came running out of his room screaming and
yelling,” Grey said “That’s when we noticed [the ﬁre].”

Grey, Naylor and Murrrnan ran out in front of the house, and
someone said, “Who’s still left?” Thenithey saw the man inside the
second ﬂoor window.

“He kicked the window out,” Munman said .

Grey and Murrman helped break the man’s fall. The man land-
ed on them and was badly cut and later taken to a local hospital. Grey
also had to go to the hospital and getthree stitches just below the
pinky of his right hand. Murrman didn’t need hospital assistance but
deﬁnitely felt «theteffects of his actions. , -

‘‘I’m real sore,” he said. “My lungs hurt.”

Inside the house, the ﬁre grew larger. . 

“It wasreal smoky,” said. ' 3' I ‘ '

BAS hosts a/night of

Mayor addresses concerns
about proposed expressway

- MELANIE DONAHOO
Staff Writer

Ed Pace is ticked off.

“The people of South Oakland are real
fed up and we’re tired of being the garbage
can of Pittsburgh,” he said last night during
an open forum held for Oakland residents.

The forum, called by Mayor Tom
Murphy and held in the Pittsburgh Board of
Education building on South Belleﬁeld
Avenue, discussed some of the problems

' ' and concerns surrounding the proposed

Mon-Fayette Expressway. The
Expressway, a $1.6 billion project, would
divert approximately 10,000 to 15,000
more vehicles per day onto Bates Street in
South Oakland. .

“This is really a critical time to express
your point of view," Murphy said.

The mayor asked the assembled resi-
dents what impact the proposed highway
wo11ld have in Oakland, and whether it was
worth possibly taking funding away from
other roads and highways in the region to
pay for the new expressway.

According to Frank Kempf, assistant
chief engineer for the Pennsylvania
Tlurnpike Commission, the expressway
would relieve much of the traﬂic on Forbes
and Fifth avenues.

“Vntually every major transportation
link in this corridor gets better if this
expressway is built,” he said.

Residents heard not only from the
Turnpike Commission, but also from sever-
al Oakland organizations and groups. Then
the residents themselves had a chance to
speak. The organizations and groups who
spoke were unanimously opposed to the
construction of the expressway.

“We have more cars, more aggravation
and less space than ever,” Oakland
Community Council President Kathy
Boykowycz said, receiving applause.

Among the concerns of the residents
were the added noise and pollution of extra

traﬂic as well as the possible destruction of
amenities such as Schenley Park or the
view of the Monongahela River.

_“This is not encouraging sprawl,”
Kempf responded. “This is revitalizing
areas that have seen better days.”

» Alternatives include not building the
expressway through Oakland at all, and
instead using the money to upgrade current
roads and improve transit services such as
park and ride. Other ideas involved explor-
ing some the ways in which a compromise
could be reached between the residents and
the Tumpike Commission.

Murphy refused to take a stance on the
issue, instead saying that he is looking at
both sides of the conﬂict —

“I’ve been very tortured by this,” he
said. “I’ve agonized over this decision for
some time, and my main concerns are the
design issues. How can we prevent these
problems and yet meet the needs of the

After almost a month of watch-
ing terror on their television
screens, students who attended last
night’s Comedy . Show at the
Engineering Auditorium let them-
selves laugh again. -

Comedians Michael Blackson

at this year’s Black Action Society

“There was a grace period
where .the terrorist attacks were
completely off limits to talk about,”
Williams said, adding that it is
important to mention the political

affair on stage. now — simply
because it’s on everyone’s minds.
Originally from Ghana,

Blackson wore African attire to the
show, which he joked looked like a
white sheet. He said that when he
went to the airport, security told
him he “got bin Laden shit on.”

He questioned the credibility of
the as-seen-on-TV psychic, Ms.
Cleo. “If she was a real psychic,
she’d tell us all about bin Laden,”
he said.

Williams said his comic act
only referred to terrorism in a way
that would not touch upon the
tragedy itself. He joked about the

THE PITT NEWS

Post-Gazette cartoonist
draws on his experiences

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

For Rob Rogers, drawing a carica-
ture of President George W. Bush is
like returning to a long-lost friend.

“Since Sept. 11, we haVen’t been .

able to make fun of him,” Rogers said
to a packed classroom as he began the
caricature by drawing beady eyes and a
hawk nose. “I ﬁnally got to put him in
a strip for tomorrow’s paper.”

“Don’t tell us,” shouts an audience
member, eager to read Rogers’ latest
witticism for himself.

' “Ah,” Rogers says with a laugh.
“A true fan.” 1

Rogers is an editorial cartoonist for
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and author
of the popular“Brewed on Grant” strip
that appears weekly in the Post-
Gazette. He spoke about his tech-
niques, craft and the state of political
humor yesterday at the Frick Fine Arts
Building.

Despite peppering his speech with
both verbal and visual gags, Rogers
titled his talk “A Cartoonist’s Life is
Not a Happy One.” The depression
stems, Rogers suggested, from a dis-
crepancy between cartoonists and their
editors.

“You see, this is a ca1toonist’s
brain,” Rogers explained, showing a
drawing of a human brain that was
filled mostly with toilet humor, with a
tiny section left for taste. According to
Rogers’ not-so-scientific drawings,
sense of humor, by contrast, only occu-
pied a rniniscule portion of the editor’s
brain.

“It really makes for conﬂict,” he-
joked. . L

Rogers began his artistic career by
making drawings to spruce up his
father’s lectures. His father was a pul-
monaiy specialist who felt showing
pictures of defective lungs for hours
might bore his audience, so he inserted
some of his young son’s drawings in

the slides. Out of respect to his humble ‘

beginnings, Rogers spiked his own lec-
ture with pictures of human lungs.
Rogers’ work covers a variety of
topics including medicine, politics,
education and the economy. He said
election season is his favorite time’ as a
cartoonist, because the candidates pro-

vide exceptional targets.

V “Once I was reading an article in
The New York Times where Pat
Buchanan stood next to Mount
Rushmore and commented that one
day he might be there as well. The car-
toon practically drew itself,” Rogers
said. .

The resulting cartoon showed

Buchanan standing next to the national
monument commenting, “We’ll just
chisel off Mr. Free the Slaves.”

In the time since the Sept. ll
attacks, Rogers said he has had to tone
down the bite in some of his pieces to
reﬂect a more sentimental, less cynical
nation. For one piece, he drew the
“new twin towers,” a ﬁreﬁghter and
police ofﬁcer standing atop the rubble
of the World Trade Center.

“A” lot of police and fire forces
have asked for copies of this one,”
Rogers said. “I think it touched a lot of
people.” -

Still, Rogers doesn’t personally
want to let go of his opinions in the
wake of the country’s new patriotism.

“There are a lot of things I couldn’t
do right now, that I could a few months
ago,” he said, speciﬁcally pointing out
a cartoon that redrew Bush as part of
“Planet of the Apes.”

“I haven’t changed my viewpoint
on issues, and there are things I still
want to criticize, but it’s still too early.
“I also have to relate my -cartoons to
the issues that are in people’s rnind[s].
Otherwise it just seems like a venue for
me to spout off. You have to merge
your opinion with topical events.”

To conclude his presentation,

Rogers drew caricatures of some old '

favorites, including. the current presi-

dent of the United States. ' ‘
“Caricatures evolve over time.

Since I ‘started drawing ‘him, Bush’s

, ears have grown and gotten-pointier,”

he said.

Rogers then drew amazing ears of
Vulcan proportion that sat on the sides
of a large head with a perpetual scowl.
“But he’s Bush Jr. so he has a tiny body
and little cowboy boots.”

Rogers complained that many
thought he’d swiped his own caricature
of Ross Perot to make Bush, which he
demonstrated was not the case at all.

“My Perot has more rounded,
Dumbo ears and an even smaller
body.” '

Azar Rejaie, a second year doctor-
al candidate in the history of art and
architecture, department attended
Roger’s lecture with a few friends.

“I thought, he was very interest-
ing,” Rejaie said. “He obviously puts a
lot of thought into what he draws. I’m
really a fan of his humor too.”

For Rogers, the most trying aspect
of his work is making his point while
staying within the limits of good taste.

He used as an example a cartoon
comparing the pope to Fidel Castro.

“If you offend someone with the
nastiness, then they’ll miss the point of
the cartoon,” he said.

Democratic divide

U_niversityDemocrats struggle within

J AMES DEWEESE
Staff Writer

Conﬂict erupted Tuesday night
shortly after the president of Pitt’s
University Democrats called the group’s
meeting to order.

Michael Guss, a member of the
group, initiated a heated exchange with
Rogette Harris, the group’s president. He
subsequently delivered a statement of
resignation from Bethany Samuels, who
until yesterday was a member of the
group’s executive board.

According to Samuels’ statement, an
ideological schism has emerged between

liberal and conservative elements in the-

University Democrats that led her and
others to form a parallel campus
Democratic organization —— the College
New Democrats. '

In theletter, Samuels — who did not
attend the meeting for religious reasons
— resigned from her position as mem-
bership and diversity coordinator of the
University Democrats, while maintain-
ing her membership in the organization.

As. part of her rationale for with-

‘ drawing from ‘ her leadership role,

Samuels speciﬁcally cited differences
between herself and Harris.

“I can no longer be a leader in this
organization because the University
Democrats’ views no longer reﬂect the
view of many members of this organiza-
tion,” Samuels said. - .

Samuels criticized what she classi-
ﬁed as blind support for peace in the face
of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, calling
that support “not only absurd, but disre-
spectful to the people who lost their lives
on Sept. 11 and their families.” —

She later clariﬁed her statement,‘ say-
ing she viewed active participation by

' some University Democrats executive

board members in campus peace rallies
as a tacit approval of a policy of peace.

Harris said the University Democrats
have taken no ofﬁcial stance with regard
to war or peace and that members of the
group are not in total agreement. Harris
added that she had never personally
attended any campus event related to the
attacks of Sept. 11.

Guss, who delivered Samuels’ state-
ment, resigned from the University
Democrats entirely, and said the College
New Democrats will now seek ofﬁcial
recognition from the University.

Terry Milani, associate director for
student activities, said there is no obsta-
cle to the formation of other campus
Democratic groups.

Milani said the Student Organization
Resource Center has two classiﬁcations
for student groups: recognized groups,

which the University designates as the 

only afﬁliated organizations, and regis-
tered groups, which possess ofﬁcial sta-
tus _but.are not the exclusive campus rep-
resentative s for their issues.

Unlike officially recognized student
groups, such as WPTS-FM and Black
Action Society, the University
Democrats are a registered‘ group, a sta-
tus that does not enjoy protection under
the University’s no—redundancy clause.

“If [students] wanted to have a con-
servative organization, they can,” Milani

'_ said. “If they wantedto have a liberal

organization, they can.”

In order to acquire
University status, the new group will
need to document membership of at least
10 people, present at least three officers,
and submit an approved constitution to
the Student_ Organization Resource
Center. 6

At one point in the show, Whitener

think the potential was there,” Klinge said. 

“But I never felt completely relaxed.”

“The University is making available

V accommodations for up to two weeks for the

students in the Meyran Avenue ﬁres,”

University spokesman Robert Hill said.
After those two weeks are up, Hill said,

the students have the option of ﬁnding new

housing or staying in University housing at

pro-rated costs.

“They showed the value of communi-

Goodman Theatre Art Institute in Chicago.
While on scholarship there, he became more
deeply involved in speech and acting.
Then, while attending law school at the
University of Wyoming, Whitener began
perfonning a magic and hypnotism show at
local clubs. He soon became involved in
motivational speaking, and by the age of 26

‘had become the national sales director for

the largest motivational speaking corpora-
tion in the country.

Today Whitener visits colleges and cor-
porations alike, showing how hypnotism
can be used as a learning tool. He has done

seminars for companies such as Oracle and

Hewlitt Packard. ,

As the show progressed, students
irnpersonated Jackie Chan, Tarzan and oth-
ers. At one point, a group of the men on
stage became convinced they were female
strippers and came out into the crowd to give
lap dances to other men. The audience went

wild as the group performed scenes from '

“Riverdance” and “Saturday Night Fever.”

But the audience laughed loudest when
Patterson grabbed the butt of freshman
Jason Yu, convinced he had stolen it from
him. When they were brought out of their
state of hypnosis, both backed quickly away
from each other, wondering what had hap-
pened. ‘

“I was hypnotized, and I only remem-

ber the bad parts. My friends said I got a lap
dance from a decent—looking girl, but I don’t
remember that,” Yu said.

Most of those involved said they would
have bought a videotape of the show if they
could. “I wished someone would have
videotaped it,” Watson said.

As the show came to a close, Whitener
played one ﬁnal trick He took Patterson

aside and convinced him he had forgotten

the number six. After miscounting his ﬁn-
gers several times, and with a little encour-
agement from Whitener, Patterson was
ﬁnally able to remember the number.

“Whatever the mind can conceive and
believe, it can achieve,” Whitener said as he
closed his program.

Come together for
Coming Out Week

Not only is this week homecoming
week, it’s also Coming Out Week. If you
haven’t noticed, campus is plastered with
posters. While some are for homecoming
events and royalty, others are for speciﬁc
happenings surrounding Coming Out
Week.

A national event that seeks to allow
closeted homosexuals to feel comfortable
“coming out,” this weeklong series of
events also promotes awareness and tol-
erance among all groups in our society.

To this end, different groups are
offering lectures and other events
throughout the week. Whatever your sex-
ual orientation, everyone should make an
effort to attend.

Unfortunately, most who attend will
likely be homosexual or bisexual, as
many heterosexuals will fear being
labeled if they attend such events. This
needs to change. “Homosexual” should
not be a derogatory term.

It is particularly important for hetero-
sexuals to attend these events, so that they
can learn more about the issues and
broaden their horizons — which is what
we are in college to do. ,

This week is a chance for people to
rethink their perceptions of homosexuals.
It is our hope that more people will

.:

become aware of the fact ,that one’s sexu-
ality is not a choice. People should accept
the fact that homosexuals and heterosex-
uals are simply attracted to different peo-
ple and that one’s sexual orientation does
not mean a person will fall neatly into a
certain stereotype.

This week is also a good chance for
heterosexuals to evaluate their behavior
toward homosexuals. This is a week to
rethink the tendency many people have to
say things like “That’s so gay” when they
mean “That sucks” and calling someone a
“fag” when they mean “dumbass.”

Although these epithets seem casual,
they still contribute to the problem of
intolerance and discrimination. Why does
something being “gay” automatically
mean _ that it sucks? Think about the
extension of that logic .for a minute. Do
you really mean to say that being gay is
bad?

If not, then don’t say it.

Although part of Coming Out Week’s
purpose is to encourage those “in the
closet” to feel free to come out, it is also
about promoting awareness of gay, les-
bian, bisexual and transgendered issues. It
is our hope that students will be open-.
minded enough to become more aware
this week.

Quitting smoking is for losers

Do you know what I hate more than
anything else in the world? Quitters.

I don’t care what you’re quitting; it
takes a special breed of weak-willed indi-

My friend Mike has told me nearly 10

you don’t see me stopping. Why? I love
both and they bring me massive enjoyment.

I have a question aimed
directly at those trying to quit

I’ll be a sad lonely old man liv-

should ﬁnd truth. Unless you

are a vegan who never drank, smoked or

inhaled toxic exhaust and runs three miles a
day, you’re prone to cancerous agents every
single day. You will probably still die early,
like the rest of your fellow Americans.

Life expectancy in the United States is
now in the mid-70s, which means most col-
lege students are nearly one—third ﬁnished
with their earthly lives. Why should you
hesitate to skim a slight few years from
your lifespan in exchange for high levels of
pleasure right now?

I’m not saying you need to disregard
your education, go crazy and spend your

But if it’s not going to kill_you right now,
then you should probably keep doing it.
This holds true for any mind- or body—alter—

Right now,.you’re probably thinking,
“Suraf, you’re a jackass. I quit smoking

because the pack saidgl was goingto get.

My response is one of pure hedonism.
Didn’t you enjoy smoking before you quit?
I’ll use myself as an example. While
this will probably prevent any girl from

you’re still young.

While I don’t work for Phillip Morris,
I just ﬁnd that cigarette quitters are the eas-

in case anyone front that company is read-

while they’re young and am doing my part
in selling smokes to the kids at local junior
high schools. These kids are going to learn
true pleasure at a young age and are going
to live fuller, richer lives than your average

When shock is more effective than humor

As part of my freshman studies
class last week, I took a_ seat in the
Masonic Temple auditorium to
watch “Pitt Falls,” a play performed
annually to warn stu-

blies? .

Only once have I seen a school
get it right. During my junior year,
the administration ‘invited the state

‘ police to my school with

dents of the “perils at
Pitt” an effort to
encourage safe sex and
responsible partying.

It ' immediately
smacked of assemblies
from ‘school years past.

In second grade, my
class used to go wild
every time the teacher
announced a trip to the

less true stories and

tims to show us the dis-
astrous effects that years
of drug abuse wreak on
the human body.

auditorium for an assem-
bly. If nothing else, we appreciated
the escape from the monotony of
classroom life. A

Most often, these assemblies
were borderline ludicrous. Once —
in high school no less — the admin-
istrators brought in two young men
wearing spandex who jumped on a
trampoline together and lectured us
about the effects of drugs and alco-
hol. It was like watching a live
action edition of Saturday Night
Live’s “Ambiguously Gay Duo.”

If you’ll allow me to paraphrase
Jerry Seinfeld for a moment, just
what’s the deal with these assem-

Girls left the audito-
rium in tears, students filled trash
cans with packs of cigarettes and
for once I applauded the school
administration for a job well done.
Today, Web sites like TheTruth.com
employ similarly aggressive tactics
because it’s the only way that
works.

I was wary from the start of
“Pitt Falls” because it’s a musical.
The first 10 minutes were like a
reunion of the Mickey Mouse club.
Drama students dressed in bright,
colorful T—shirts ﬂooded the stage
singing a happy song about staying
on the right track. I find it hard to

They displayed a series .

listen to anyone lecturing about top-
ics pertaining to drinking and date
rape when they’re dressed like "Zack
and Screech from “Saved by the
Bell.”

The play not only fumbled with ‘
its overall delivery but also patron- _

ized the freshmen in attendance,
treating us like we were still those
eagerly shifting second graders.

Undoubtedly, the most memo-
rable scene from the play was when
the actors and actresses scream ——
yes, scream — instructions on how
to don a condom.

“Roll the condom over the head
of the penis before inserting it into
the mouth, anus or vagina!”

Gee, thanks. .

I I can’t help but wonder if dis-.

tributingv packs of condoms to the

audience members beforehand
would have made the same kind of
statement — and a . much more

effective one at that.

The play also treats issues like
depression, addiction. and rape far
too candidly. Anyone who knows a
victim of substance abuse knows
that it takes more than running
around ﬂashing a guidance coun-
selor’s phone number before
they’re up and dancing with the rest

of the crowd. And not once did the
actors think to mention the word
“relapse.”

Racism is another -issue that was
left untouched, which I found
shocking considering Pitt recently
cracked the Princeton Review’s top
20 list of schools where students
have difficulty associating with
people outside of their race.

I never once doubted the inten-
tions of plays like “Pitt Falls,” but
it’s just too late to be singing
cheesy songs about binge drinking.
As one girl sitting next to me put it,
“This is the most insulted I’ve felt
since the day I arrived here.”

If executed correctly, assem-

blies like “Pitt Falls” could be an-

extremely effective means of reach-
ing out to students. From. now on,
those involved with the production
of “Pitt Falls” must remember that
issues like alcoholism, depression,

rape and drug addiction are not

laughing matters. . V
And if we continue to treat them
as such, the only joke is on us.

Mike Darling hopes he’ll never
have to watch men in spandex jump
on a trampoline ever again. E—mail

Love your slumlord: tips for Oakland living

Just as attending classes or football games is a
natural part of the Pitt experience, so too is living in

off-campus Oakland housing. With its porch-front »

parties, backyard keggers and ability to serve as an
all-purpose trashcan, Oakland is the perfect sanctu-
ary for Pitt undergrads, as well as the occasional
deranged homeless person.

But as many students learned during the first
six weeks of this school year, thereis a dark side to
Oakland student housing. Someone must own the
houses that line the_streets of Oakland, and often
the owners fit perfectly into the category of student
housing slumlords.

Student housing slumlords, much like credit
card companies that offer free T-shirts in exchange
for crushing debt, act on the principle that few seg-

. ments of the population are as readily exploitable as

college students. With the demand for off-campus
housing so high, slumlords know their properties
will be rented — no matter how shoddy the mainte-
nance or how high the prices.

For those students who live in ignorant bliss on
campus, allow me to offer examples. The symptoms
of having a slumlord read like bad Jeff Foxworthy
retreads.

You know you have a slumlord if your lease
sets a limit on the number of times per day you can
ﬂush the toilet. _

You know you have a slumlord if the only
month the heat is turned on is August.

You know you have a slumlord if the roof col-

lapses on move-in day and the landlord says,
“That’s coming out of your security deposit.”

Of course, this isn’t to say that all Oakland
landlords are slumlords. Some landlords quickly
respond to maintenance problems. Some landlords
pay for utilities such as gas and water. Some land-
lords don’t think of their tenants as too

Third, and most importantly, learn voodoo.
Since most slumlords have written the leases so that

. tenants have the same rights as colonial-era inden-
tured servants, the only method of ' retribution» 4

against a slumlord may be the black arts. One can
do truly amazing things with a few strands of

stupid, busy or drunk to respond to the
landlord’s negligence of‘ his or her
responsibilities. '
While such landlords exist, they are
as rare as graduating seniors with per-
fect class attendance records. This
unfortunately means that slumlords are
a fact of Oakland life. But there are

 

human hair and a pint of “fresh chicken
blood. A

Perhaps these suggestions, along
with a bottle of Bacardi,wi1l help you to
deal with — and maybe even love — your
slumlord. Do not laugh at this proposal,
because loving your slumlord, in its own
Pittsburgh-twisted way, is like ' loving
Pitt itself.

ways to make the tenant-slumlord rela-
tionship as smooth as possible.
First, remember that slumlords are

people too. Granted, they are usually
lazy, cheap and vindictive, but they are people too.
Treat them with respect and they will be more like-
ly to respect you. '

Second, learn to live with cold temperatures.‘
Many slumlords hate to do things like repair
heaters, fix‘ broken pipes or spend money in any
conceivable way. This often forces tenants to make
a few lifestyle adjustments such as taking cold
showers and sleeping in Gore-Tex parkas. While it
may be seem inconvenient at first, you may soon
find yourself wondering how you ever tolerated
temperatures above 50 degrees.

us our residences. Anyone can see the

meaning of Pitt within a towering Cathedral, but it up

takes a real Pitt student to find the same meaning
within the decaying houses of Oakland.

Keep this in mind the next time you try to shut
a window that doesn’t close or take a shower in
water that doesn’t get warmer than room tempera-
ture. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s a whole lot
cheaper than moving to Shadyside or Squirrel Hill.

Loud o proud

Roguish Irish punks invade Laga

The Dropkick Murphys I
Tomorrow, 7 p.m. ‘

Club Laga, $15

(412) 682-2050

DIANA MOFFO
The Pitt News

Brush up on, your brogue and pound a pint of
Guinness at the pub. The Dropkick Murphys are in
town and they’ve brought the best in kick-up-your-
heels-drink-till-dawn-throw-your-arms-around—the-
stranger-next—to-you punk music. “

Their blend of Irish folk and punk is sure to turn
any -Smith or Jones into an O’Brien orMcConnell-.
Throw in a dash of hardcore and a pinch of rock and
you have the recipe for the Dropkick Murphys’ unique
style. Just think “Danny Boy” on speed and you have
the idea.

The Boston-based band will promote their latest
full-length album, Sing Loud Sing Proud, tomorrow at
Club Laga. Their set will most likely include such loud
and raucous hits as “The_Fighting 69th,” a Wolftones
original, and crowd pleasers “Boys on the Docks” and
“Never Alone.” .

The Dropkick Murphys aren't just for the hardcore,
head-banging set. The band plays tunes like the tradi-.
tional Irish drinking songs “Finnegan’s Wake” and
“Caps and Bott1es.” The crowd often recites these mel-
low and catchy pub favorites word for word.

Formed in 1996 in the basement of a friend’s
Boston barbershop, the Dropkick Murphys started as a
group of friends wanting to blend their unique musical
inﬂuences into one chaotic but satisfying sound.

Often hailed as a voice for the working class and
the regular Joe, the band practices what it preaches. In
true punk rock style, the Dropkick Murphys include the
crowd as much as possible in their shows.

On the band’s Web site, the group members pro-
claim, “Our stage and our microphone are yours.”

After the show on Thursday night, you might have

_ a new appreciation for the old Irish tunes your grandfa-

ther is always whistling. Maybe you’ll even introduce
him to the energetic sounds of -the Dropkick Murphys.
Whatever you do, one pint of Guinness is plenty.

Staff Writer

Look out kids, the music genres you know and
love are makin’ babies.
Slowly but surely, musicians around America are

- tiring of the same washed up four-chord, Verse/cho-

rus/verse/chorus pop-rock song structures. An explo-
ration into the realms of crossbreeding genres is afoot.

Pittsburgh’s Lexus Jumps are pushing their
investigation deep into _the various formats of emo,
hardcore, loud rock and even some funk. And their
ﬁrst album, Meaningless, packs some mean audio
heat, too.

_ The funk inﬂuence is rather sparse, concentrated
mostly in a few shorter tracks that are _
speciﬁcally geared toward that sound. A
A few slap-bass arts emerge but
maintain the cohesion of the sound.

The loud rock elements are most
dominant and consistent, and not
without due cause.

The blending of Chris Srnith’s
heavy, Hum-esquei guitar with Jim
Watson’s subtle yet commanding bass
playing and the addition of "Josh
Cohen’s thick, driving drumming creates
a formula for walls of seamless intensity.

On vocals, Deborah Cohen comes
through with familiar emo discordance.
While at times the vocals get wearing, the
true delight comes when Deborah lets
go and wails. Her [singing is dwarfed
and crushed by her ability to scream
like she means it.

Lexus Jumps’ songs are a whole
greater than the sum of the parts: the
instruments of guitar, bass, drum
and voice coalesce into the ener-
getic “Firelight,” the spirited
“Shattered Perfection” and
the somberi
“Meaningless.”

This is not -
to say that th __
album is withou
ﬂaws. If Lexus -
Jumps has once
major weakness, itgis in
the lyrics. They fall
rather ﬂat and feel
immature. The words

sayexactly what Deborah means, with very little l~

room for interpretation or ambiguity allowing the lis-
tener to modify to their own experiences.

While the band is pushing their sound in a unique
direction, the album shows room for progress as far as

‘attaining their own distinctive sound. All of the musi-

cians are excellent attheir respective instruments and
excel in musicianship, but the trained car can easily
pick out many of their individual inﬂuences.

This is not necessarily a bad thing, but a break-
through sound is what every band should seek to
attain. Here more than anywhere Lexus Jumps has
potential.

This Saturday, Lexus Jumps appears at the
Millvale Industrial Theater with the D.B.C. and other
bands. The show’s proceeds beneﬁt a family who has
lost its home to a ﬁre, and Lexus Jumps will donate
half of the money ﬁom the sale of their CDs to the
family. -

The band hasn’t had many live performances, an
arena yet to -be conquered, but if their live show is
anywhere near as solid as their recorded presentation,
they’re sure to blow audiences away. With more live
shows, some development and further exploration,
Lexus Jumps will undoubtedly take Pittsburgh by

storm.

Paul Tabachneck
‘£‘s"L‘r7i‘r

Paul Tabachneck is an asshole, but he’s a charming asshole.

“I put a lot of myself out there. rm pretty out—going, which
gets me into  jams,” the musician said. ,

In addition to serving up a healthy dose of revealing per-
sonal lyrics, Tabachneck’s two Oct. 3 releases, Dead Pressed
Flowers and Long’ Play Compact Disc, rely on a basic f1ve—piece
band and talented background musicians for a successful result.

Wednesday, October 10, 2001

T The front  for the now-defunct band Dead Pressed.

Flowers, Tabachneck said the album is also named after the
lyrics from a melancholy song on the disc called “Others.” The
guitar work lends a hand to the overall dark mood. For example,
“The Message”.begins with some ear—pleasing artiﬁcial har-

monics, but .12 seconds later, crunchy distorted power chords

assault the listener.
. The album tastefully shifts ﬁom a melodic sensibility to
rock, and evenincludes instruments such as-a piano and a ﬂute.
“Our producer had a ﬂair for orchestral arrangements,”
Tabachneck said. “He wanted to make a Paul Tabachneckealbum
to get high to.” '
Tabachneck also said songs on the thought-provoking

album are a reaction to what’s going on in his life. The album’s .-

closing track, “Glad It’s Gone,” describes the joy and pain asso-

_ ciated with the break up of a bad relationship.

Though Flowers had not yet been released, the song “Burn
This Place Down” was a track on the 2000 Pittsburgh X—ﬁles, a
compilation album that features some of the musicians in the

‘Pittsburgh area. . g
Unfortunately, artistic differences led to the breakup of ‘

Dead Pressed Flowers, but every member agreed to release the
album anyway because of the amount of hard work put into it.
The parting negatively effected Tabachneck. Through the

‘help of a fellow musician, Tabachneck gained his footing and

moved on. .

“I approachedmy music with a lot more abandon. I learned
to let go of a lot of preconceptions of what I should be doing,”
Tabachneck said. ‘He said when ‘he’s composing, the music just
comes to  « V

“If you see me walking around singing to myself, I’m not
crazy, I’m just ﬁguring out the melody and the lyrics,” he said.

The result is his self-produced Long Play Compact Disc.
Long Play leans toward a raw, more blunt format. The orches-

tration is gone, save for piano that appears here and there. ‘

Musically the album is a mellow affair, but again, the lyrics take
the spotlight. Intertwined Within the stories of heartache spun by
Tabachneck is a sense of humor. “Up For Hire” sums up
Tabachneck’s wit in the lines “_IfI could I’d trade our wisdom for

a party ball.”

Tabachneck performs regularly at Friday Nite Irnprov, and‘

samples can be accessed on the . Internet at

Ambient chemistry

Triple Point
loscil

While a concept album about
thermodynamics may not sound terri-
bly exciting to some people, musi-
cian Scott Morgan, under the name
loscil, has constructed a well-pro-
duced, albeit repetitive, album that
will appeal most heavily to fans of
ambient or minimalist music. Triple
Point, otherwise known as the sound-
track to chemistry students’ dreams
and nightmares, was released Oct. 8.

Ioscil counts Henry Mancini and
Gavin Bryars among his many influ-
ences, but you will be hard-pressed
to find anything resembling pop stan-

dards oriclassical music here. From
start to finish, Triple Point envelops
the listener in drawn-out ambient
synth drones, speaker—wobb1ing bass
lines, and an assortment of organic,
slightly creepy tones. . I ‘
loscil seems to be interested
mostly in establishing ‘a mood on
Triple Point. While this is not neces-
sarily a bad thing, he does so at the
expense of variety. Practically every
song lacks a distinct melody, and
without hooks of any kind for the lis-
tener, the tracks simply don’t have
much personality, blending into each
other unobtrusively. ,
Still, Triple Point is far from a
disaster. The album succeeds when
the tones and beats no longer sound
like they were taken from synthesiz-
er presets or the latest percussion
samples disc. Track two, “Ampere,”
wins points for juxtaposing a vague-

ly funky house beat-with some
strange watery noises. “Vapour,”

with its hesitant rhythm, crackling

samples and industrial/ambient back-
ground, sounds like some long-for-
gotten machine struggling to activate
itself.  ,

The album’s production is
immaculate, but it only highlights the
clinical, even remote, qualities of
Triple Point. Perhaps loscil was
attempting to make an analogy
between the chilly. music of his
album and the sterile environment of
a chemical laboratory, and in that
respect he has succeeded.

But if you’re looking for aural.

wallpaper with better rhythms and
melodies or more interesting sounds,
check out Brian En'o’s Ambient series
or Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient
Works releases instead.

Beautiful dreamers

The Coast Is Never C/ear
Beulah '

Velocette
ikrkﬂr _.

It’s funny how certain names mark
generations. How many girls do you
know‘ today named Doris, Lorraine,
Beatrice —— or Beulah, for that matter?
Beulah, a name actually quite popular
among the grandmother set, means
“beautiful.” Beulah is also the name of
a band composed of California indie
popsters and members of the Elephant 6 '
collective.

Beulah’s third LP, The Coast Is
Never Clear, provides listeners with fun
and "catchy California-sunshine pop.
Songs like “What Will You Do When
Your Suntan Fades?” and “Burned by
the Sun” resound long after the album
has ended, -

“Popular Mechanics for Lovers” -
perhaps the catchiest song on the album

—- sticks in your head for hours. The
sweet and bubbly refrain cautions an old
love about a new lover, “Just because he
loves you too, he wouldn’t ever take a
bullet for you/Don’t believe a word he
says, he would never cut his heart out
foryou.” Light and lovely, it sounds sus-
piciously like a more sophisticated ver-
sion of Oasis’ “She’s Electric.”

The melodies — light and complex
medleys of piano, drums, horns and

strings -— complement the honest and
plaintive vocals. The first song on the
album, “Hello Resolven,” opens with a
slow, drawling piano and lazy yet
majestic strings, perhaps beﬁtting the
start of day.  . .
The album.’ s appropriate final song,
“Night Is the Day Turned Inside Out,”
utilizes a pleasant blend of piano and
horns. The combination of soft lyrics
and an echoing, resonating chorus is

reminiscent of something’ from Wilco’s
Summerteeth, and the song continues
the album’s cohesive theme of the day-

time, sunshine and clear skies.

Think of The Coast Is Never Clear
as Indian summer; it’s never too late in
the year or too cold to enjoy this last ray
of warm and melodic sunshine. Just like
beautiful late fall afternoons, Beulah
lives up to its gracious name. -

Jettingham
Jettingham

Republic/Universal Records
skiksﬁr

In the countless music award shows every year, one hot_

selling trend in music wins everything and gains a spot in the
limelight before fading back into obscurity. At the end of the
‘80s, hair bands won. Then it was grunge, rap, Latin pop,
teen pop. Now bands like Blink 182 and Sum 41 have proven
this year’s winning trend is pop-punk music.

Jettingham hasn’t made it to the ranks of Blink 182 and
Sum 41 yet, but you will ﬁnd the quartet’s similar pop—punk
style on the “American Pie 2” soundtrack. The first single off
their debut self—titled album on Republic/Universal Records
is a catchy song about a high school party. ‘

Jettingham constructs a carefree, -rowdy high school
party theme throughout the album. The lyrics stick with the
current pop—punk trend of four tattooed guys in their 20s rem-
iniscing about the good ol’ days. In fact, the only real thing
that sets them apart from the other bands, besides the obvious
omission of a number in their name, is they seem to be a bit
more brazen.

Choruses of screaming, “We don’t go to bed, we just
have sex,” over bass cords in “Never, Never, Never” demon-
strate their brutal honesty. The song is upbeat and a perfect
party mood setter. ' _

“Cheating” is another outstanding track. A girl catches
her boyfriend in the act and threatens, “If I’m leaving with a
broken heart, you’re leaving with a bleeding nose.”

Similarities between bands of a certain genre tend to be
annoying. Jettingham’s album produces the same mood as
other bands they might end up competing against for record
sales. Every song is distinctly different, but will bring listen-
ers back to high school in the same way.

Who knows, maybe Jettingham will do for mainstream
punk what the Backstreet Boys or ‘N Sync did for pop. It
seems likely that J ettingharn has enough musical charisma to
compete against the likes of Blink 182 for MT V’s Viewer’s

Choice award next year. If you are up for watching the pop-

punk bands duke it out, pick up Jettingham before the genre’s
limelight fades out.

Long Sleeve Story

Devon
Three Word Records
sfrtksk

When Stefan Lessard, the bassist
for Dave Matthews Band, went out to
ﬁnd other artists and bring them to the
forefront of today’s music, he found
someone very interesting. She was
young, she was a little angry, and she
was chock-full 0’ good 01’ fashion folk
rock talent. Her name is Devon and you
will be hearing a lot about her in the
very near future.‘

On her second album, Long Sleeve
Story, 18-year-old Devon has broad-
ened her folk sound, borrowed a page
from the book of Bob Dylan and
brought in electronics. She introduced a
band with keyboards, drums, horns and
the “must have” for all albums of today,
the tumtable.

The folk sound her fans have come
to love is still there; it’s just buried
under some edgy guitars riffs and funk
beats. Lessard-contributes to those riffs
and beats; he produced and guests on
ﬁve of the 12 tracks. '

Devon’s life has been a little south
of normal. She was raised in a com-
mune outside of Charlottesville, Va.,
where she met Lessard and now resides.

THE PITT NEWS

She learned to play guitar at the com— A

mune at age 11, and by the time she was
16 she had released her self-titled debut
album, also featuring Lessard.

‘ Her storytelling is reminiscent of
Fiona Apple and Liz Phair: dirty and
daring. Her songs are angry yet sensi-
tive. They look ahead to a time of heal-

ing but never forget the wounds of the
past.

A standout track on the album is
“Sleep Satisﬁed.” For four minutes and
26 seconds she pours out her feelings of
rejection and rage on the listener like
we’re her psychiatrists.

' Other noteworthy tracks include

Wednesday, October 10, 2001

“Keep Light,” “She’s Not Here,”
“Swamp Love” and the title track,
“Long Sleeve Story.”

No one might know about Devon or
her Long Sleeve Story, so get in on the
secret that only Charlottesville knows
and pick up this album.

Simple folk

Undisturbed

Beaver Nelson
Black Dog Records
'7i‘r7i‘r

Singer/songwriters are typically white
vocalists without fabulous voices who play
a competent guitar and who are in their late
20s or early 30s. Often, they have forsaken
their youthful energy and optimism for
more introspective, serious and self—right—
eous songs. By this deﬁnition, on
Undisturbed, Beaver Nelson fully embraces
the title.

Nelson’s third album, Undisturbed, is a-
contemplative, country and western bluesy
set of songs. Unforttmately, though his
lyrics show promise and cleverness, they
rarely" delve deeper than surface observa-
tions. This is not uncommon in rock music,
but usually it is covered by a beautiful,
expressive voice, impressive and original
music or atleast a decent melody. But none
of these are traits readily found in Nelson’s
songs.

Nelson seems to be scared of aging.
One song, “Eleven Again” yearns for the
carefree days of yore. In “Did You Know?”
he states, “The future umolled like a ball of
twine/And all those summers since/Slowly
killing all suspenseffhe past as worthless as

‘an empty mine.” He goes on to promise, “I

will ‘remember every thing.”

Also, occasionally, his lyrics become
preachy, especially on “God’s Tears,” in
which he berates non-believers and cynics
by proudly stating, “No dam big enough/No
levy so wide/Many have scoffed/Many
have tried . . . But-I felt the ﬁre right between
my ears/Science is a liar and those are God’s
tears.” This could be a turn-off for listeners
who don’t happen to agree with his views.
Or who believe in science.

Nelson’s voice is similar to Bob
Dylan’s without the passion Dylan evokes.
He doesn’t generally try to do too much

. with the limited vocal talents he possesses,

so most of his songs are sung in a matter-of-
fact, understated way. .

His music is fairly basic if at the core,
although he uses a number of different
styles throughout the album and adds differ-
ent elements to avoid making his songs too
repetitive. “God’s Tears” is especially inter-
esting, and “Experiments in Love” is very
pleasant. But he lacks a musical vision to
consistently keep the listener’s interest.

Nelson’s music is harmless. Ifyou’re a
fan of college radio or “The World Cafe,”
and don’t have adverse opinions to religious
messages in rock music, then he will likely
appeal to you. But don’t expect anything
earth shattering, for while he may be undis-
turbed, he’s also undistinguished.

4 ‘THE BESTPIACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Pitt’s talent  
should equal
better record

 

  

Can somebody please tell me why the
Pitt football team is not winning?

I am in my fourth year here at the con-
crete’ learning center, and I have never seen
a team with so much talent perform so inef-
fectively. .

Remember the beginning of the sea-
son, when everyone, including myself, was

hyped about the upcoming season? It was: ‘

only about a month ago.

The team had its entire defense retum-
ing, a defense that was dominant last sea-
son, a seasoned quarterback returning and a
Heisman candidate in Antonio Bryant

‘ What a difference six weeks makes.

Walt Harris is now being seriously i

questioned and doubted for the ﬁrst time in
his tenure here. Bryan Knighthas one sack
in four games. The defense made South
Florida and N one Dame look like offensive

' powerhouses, once again there is somewhat

of a quarterback controversy and it would
be hard to ﬁnd a game where the team exe-
cuted for a solid half of football.

There is no doubt that this team might
have had too high expectations from out-
siders and from within, -but the fact remains
that there is a" lot of talent on this team.

' Granted, the rtmning backs are young
and the offensive line is still getting used to
playing together, but there is no reason for
this team to be 1-3. .

The fault has to lie with somebody.

There is a difference between playing
the game and knowing how to win. Right
now it looks as if the team is going through
the motions. '

Whose job is it to get the players to per-
form and execute? The obvious answer is
the coaching staff, but I blame the seniors.

All of the Big East teams are entering

Pasqualoni said. “They’ve had some tough

know that this week Pitt is going to be ﬂy-

Pasqualoni expressed concerns about
his team’s physical health — he believes
that early games against tough nonconfer-

He also said he’s seen improvement in
the Orangemen’s passing . game, which

week’s contest to be no less competitive.

Men’s soccer drops fifth straight conece game

NICK MANZI
\ The Pitt News

The Panthers traveled to Syracuse
Sunday for their fifth Big East
matchup of the season. While Pitt
was hoping to come back with its
first conference win, Syracuse had
other plans.

The game started well for the
Panthers, deadlocked with Syracuse
for most of the first half. But just
after’ the 36-minute mark, Syracuse’s
Kirk Johnson beat the Panthers’ goal-

keeper Justin Gaul for the first goal

of the game.

The Orangemen’s Jarret Park got
his first of three assists on the play.
The goal gave Syracuse the lead, and
the first half ended 1-0.

The second half started with a
quick goal by Syracuse. After only 1
minute, 28 seconds into the second
half Johnson scored his second goal
of the game, which increased the
Syracuse lead to 2-0.

The game continued for another
23 minutes without a goal, until the
Panthers put the ball in’ the net for
their first goal of the game. Redshirt
junior Toure Weaver scored Pitt’s
lone goal of the game on his first
shot. He put the ball past Syracuse’s
goalkeeper Anthony Peters after

claiming a rebounded shot by Nate
Montgomery.

Montgomery was credited with
the assist on the play. The goal was
Weaver’s first of his career. With the
goal the Panthers cut the
Orangemen’s lead in half, ‘bringing
the score to 2-1. A

It stayed a one-goal game until
the 80:18 mark, when Syracuse put
the Panthers away for good. Ryan
Hall added the insurance goal for the
Orangemen, which put the Panthers
down 3-1 with less than 10 minutes to
play.

The final 10 minutes of the game
had all but expired with the Panthers
still down by two goals. Before the
final whistle was blown, Syracuse
scored its final goal at the 90-minute
mark. Guido Cristofori beat Gaul in
the closing seconds of the game to
bring the final score to 4-1.

Gaul finished the game with four
saves and the loss, while Syracuse’s
goalkeeper Peters finished the game
with five saves.

Pitt finished the game with seven
shots. Montgomery, Bryan Hopper
and Chris Churchill each had two
shots to lead the Panthers. Weaver
‘finished with one shot.

With the win Syracuse improves

to 5-3 overall and 3-2 in the Big East. .

COURTESY OF THE BIG EAST

Boston College wide receiver Dedrick DeWalt leads its offense against Virginia
Tech. The No. 6-ranked Hokies have shut out three teams this season.

going to be ready to play, and we’ve had
some great games with Pitt over the last
few years.”

No. 2 ‘Canes visits No. 14 ‘Noles in an
in-state battle

Although Florida State’s unexpected
loss to North Carolina three weeks ago
lowered the stakes of this matchup on
paper, it will still be a tough task for Miami
(40, 2-0) to escape Doak. S. Campbell
Stadium with a win, because they are on
the road and facing a Florida State team

 

coming off of a bye week.
Miami head coach Larry Coker spoke
candidly about his tearn’s prospects in

what is perennially a highly anticipated-

matchup. While acknowledging that the
bye week and home—ﬁeld advantage for
Florida -State were major concems, he"
refused to make excuses for the
Hurricanes.

“Football is a game of momentum and
I think they’ve got a great comfort level
there, and they’ve got the crowd behind
them,” Coker said. “Those two things
combined make it a very difficult environ-
ment, but we can’t let the crowd ‘take over

' the game. We have to do a good job on the

ﬁeld. ’ '

“The extra week is an advantage as
well, especially when it comes to getting
players healthy. But that’s just the way
things fall sometimes, and it won’t make
any difference. when Saturday rolls
around,” Coker said.

Miami dropped behind Florida to No.
2 in the Associated Press poll this week
following a 1ess—than—ste_1lar performance
in a 38-7 victory over miniscule Troy State
last weekend. But Coker said he.has little
concern about the polls, which his team

. has no control over, and doesn’t believe in

the validity of margin-of—victory in deter-

» mining a tearn’s strength.

“It’s very early, and there is still a lot

of football left. I don’t know that we
deserved to leap ahead of Florida in the
polls when we did, and I don’t know that
we deserve to drop behind them now,” he
said. “We’ve got a lot of extremely tough
football games, and we’ve got to win. If
we do, then the polls will take care of
themselves.” .

While Coker admitted that Miami is
facing a younger Florida State squad than
they are used to, he gave praise to its
defensive speed, skilled players and quar-
terback Chris Rix, whom Coker believes
gives Florida State more mobility than it
ever had with Chris Weinke.

He also acknowledged that his
offense, led by standout quarterback Ken
Dorsey, must come up big against a tradi-

tionally tough Florida State defense. The _

game kicks off Saturday at noon.

Boston College visits Blacksburg to face
No. 6 Hokies " _

When Boston College (4-1,2-0) visits
Virginia Tech (540, 2-0) on Saturday,»it will
be a matchup of the two best rushing
offenses in the Big East.

Virginia Tech leads the conference
with 246.6. rushing yards per game, with
Boston College trailing close behind with
213.4 yards per game on the ground.

THE PITr_ NEWS A 19

Pitt record does not
represent talent level  

Column, page 15

There doesn’t seem to be a lot of excite-
ment, argument or any signs of emotions on
the sidelines.

The seniors and/or so-called leaders
such as Bryant need to get in somebody’s

. face when a player misses his assignment. I

just don’t see the emotion invested into each
game. It’s there at times and there are spurts
of passion and responsiveness, but I don’t

see players putting their souls on the line,~

play in and play out.

Where’s Knight to publicly challenge
himself and his teammates? Why can’t
David Priestley, as a ﬁfth-year senior, put
the offense on his back and lead the team to
victory? Does thisteam know how to pull
out ‘a win or more importantly, do they
believe in Harris’ system?

Harris and his staff were brutally out-
coached against South Florida, making no
visible adjustments to contain the passing

, game, and the team was certainly not pre-

pared for 

"And just how many times are you
going to run the option with Rod
Rutherford? Every team knows that it’s
coming and Raymond Kirkley is a
north/south runner. He’s not going to turn
the comer too often, so since Marcus
Furrnan is not being redshirted, give him a
shot at running the option. 2

Nobody can tell me that N otre Dame is
17 points better than Pitt.

Note to players — don’t be in awe of

Ramon Walker, follow in’ his footsteps. I

don’t think Walker even exists. My theory is

that Steve Pederson is paying Ronnie Lott
to put orrNo. 25 and play for Pitt.

Walker is a maniac. He  20 tackles
last week . . .. again, and out of his 64 tackles
on the season, 49 are solo. That’s insane. He
is a one-man wrecking crew that ﬂies off of
the hash marks with such reckless abandon
that I fear for his shoulder ﬂying 5 yards
back after every hit.

There is no time to criticize R.J.
English. English made a bad play and there
is no doubt that he has replayed the fumble
in his mind a million times by now. English,
like the rest of the team, needs to regroup
and realize that this weekend’s game against
Syracuse will make or break the season.

Pitt has not defeated Syracuse since
1989. The defense has a large challenge in
holding James Mungro down, but if it can
do that, Syracuse’s passing game is not a
dangerous threat.

Priestley has not won a _big game in his
career and it would be nice to see him get
that monkey off . of his back against
Syracuse. Bryant showed that he was back

to his old ways last week against the Irish

and English always shows up to play.
This is not a young team overall. There
should be no arm tackling. There should be

no interceptions by opposing linemen and

this team should be able to gain more than 2
yards per carry. _

p The talent is there. Saturday will prove
if the minds are capable of joining the bod-
ies on the ﬁeld

who has carried the ball 140 times for 713
yards and seven touchdowns.
Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer

showed genuine concern for Boston

College’s vaunted offense, calling it the
“supreme test” for the dominant Hokies
defense up- to this point in the season.
Beamer praised the skill and balance of the
Eagles offensive unit. I

‘-‘This week, I think our defense is
going to really be challenged. They’re per-
fectly balanced in the run-to-pass ratio,” he
said. “They’ve got a very athletic quarter-
back, some good young receivers and one
of the best nmning backs in the confer-
ence, and Boston College always has a
tough offensive line.”

‘ Along with a defense that posted three
shutouts this season, Virginia Tech has
remained undefeated on the merit of their
special teams, and Beamer stated that punt
returner Andre Davis will go a long way in
determining Virginia Tech’s success this
weekend.

, “Davis is a playmaker, and anytime he
gets his hands on the ball he could get into
the end zone,” Beamer said. “He’s got
great speed, good size and he understands
this game very well. I think he’s really a
big-tirne player.”

Boston College coach Tom O’Brien

THE PITT NEWS

praised. the Hokie. defense as .much as
Beamer praised the Eagle oifense, saying
that Virginia Tech’s offense is much more
experienced and improved a lot over last
year. He did express concems about the
Boston College offensive line in giving
Green some holes to rim through.

“Our offensive line is a deﬁnite con-
cern, because their defense comes at you
from all angles,” he said. “But we’ve been
preparing for this stretch of our season all
year, and We’re getting better from week to
week We’re breaking in three new kids on
the line, and I think we have the right play-
ers in there, but we’ll ﬁnd out on Saturday
night.”

Kickoff is at6:30 p.m.

Mountaineers travel to South Bend

West Virginia (2-3, 0-2) will attempt
to forget about a 35-0 home loss to
Virginia Tech as it faces a Notre Dame
team that picked up its ﬁrst win of the sea-
son last week at home against Pitt.

Neither team has shown a lot of fire-
power on offense this season, and West
Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez has
been dissatisﬁed with his team’s passing
game.

“Our offense is quarterback ﬁiendly, .

and we’ve got to get better protection and
better decisions from that position. It’s

been good at times, but not what We’re

used to,” he said.

As a result, Rodriguez has yet to name
either Brad Lewis or Derek Jones as the
starter for Saturday’s game.

“Right now, I don’t know who’s going
to start. I’ll see how they practice, and
whoever does better in practice and gives
us a better chance to win will take the ﬁrst
snap against Notre Dame,” he said. .

Rodriguez also said his team needs to
do a better job of stopping the option,
which Notre Dame quarterback Carlyle
Holidays ru_ns often and effectively.

Kickoff is at 2:30 p.m.

T‘vvo struggling teams ﬁght it out in
Philly

The 2001 campaign has been a disap-
pointing one thus far for both Rutgers (1-
4, 0-3) and Temple (1-3, 0-1), and each
team will attempt to garner a rare confer-
ence win at Veterans Stadium on Saturday.

Neither coach had many_ positive
things to say about their respective teams’
performances to this point, but each
addressed improvements that need to be
rrrade in order to grab some momentum.

Temple starting quarterback Mike
McGann sprained his thumb in last week’s
loss to Boston College, and head coach
Bobby Wallace said that McGann was
day—to—day and that Mac DeVito may have

to replace the freshman quarterback.

Hurricanes prepare for game at Florida State

“Right now, his thumb’s sore, but it’s
not broken. We have one more day to eval-
uate it, and it would be difficult for him to
start without getting any snaps in practice,
being a true freshman,” he said.

‘While Temple has’ question marks at
the quarterback position to address,
Rutgers has problems of their own.
Essentially, they are without a starting
kicker, and Steve Barone missed two extra
points last week in -a close loss to
Syracuse. Rutgers head coach Greg
Schiano said that their evaluation will be
on a weekly basis. 1

“It’s been a constant evaluation of
Steve Barone and Ryan Sance. Steve was
the guy we decided to go with last week,
and that position will be open this week,
and we will see what transpires,” he said.

Schiano stressed good preparation
against a Temple team that could be easily
overlooked.

“Right now we’re not worried about
their record,” Schiano said. “We’re going
to prepare for a football team that has def-
inite schemes, and at this point in our pro-
gram, we have to worry about what we are
doing at Rutgers. _We have to get every
aspect of our program on the right track.
Temple will come out and play hard; it’s
their ﬁrst game at the Vet and they are

_ going to be excited.”

Kickoff is at 4 p.m.

The Panthers allowed Rutgers to score

‘ three second—half goals after playing a" score-

less ﬁrst half in their 3-0 loss on Sunday.
The ﬁrst 49 minutes of the game were
scoreless as the Panthers and Scarlet Knights
were at a standstill. Carli Lloyd broke the tie
and put Rutgers up 1-0 as she‘ scored her
ninth goal of the year at the 49:04 mark
Rutgers did not sit on a one goal lead for

Cande Ruiz-Bradbury and Kimberly
Sturk led the Panthers with four shots on

goal each. The Scarlet Knights outshot the .

Panthers by just ﬁve, 20-15.

Brown recorded six saves, while
Rutgers goalkeeper Christine Caldwell
recorded the shutout, with nine saves.

“Our success is simply a matter of exe-

every game and getting unlucky, if we keep
