Administration  consider free
bus rides for adjunct Pitt faculty

enior administrators
say they will consider
including Pitt’s thou-

sands of volunteer faculty mem.- .

bers among the University per-
sonnel who can ride for free on
Port Authority of Allegheny
County buses and light-rail ve-
hicles.

But extending the ride—for-
free service to volunteer faculty
(usually referred to as “adjunct”
faculty) would dramatically in-
crease Pitt’s costs and probably
would translate into a smaller
pool of money for salaries next
year, administrators warned Sen-
ate Council on April 9.

Pitt is paying the Port Au-
thority $1.9 million this year in
exchange for county—wide free
rides for Pittsburgh campus stu-
dents and benefits-receiving
employees. Pitt’s costs are ex-
pected to increase by as much as
20 percent for the next contract
year, which begins Aug. 1. (See
April 5 University Times.)

Pittsburgh campus students
pay a $55 per term safety and
transportation fee that partly
subsidizes the Port Authority
costs. The University adminis-
tration pays the balance with
auxiliary funds. Faculty and staff
pay nothing for the service, al-
though they, like students, ride
for free by showing their Pitt
I.D. cards.

Pittsburgh campus students
and employees were issued new
I.D. cards that became effective
Jan. 2. The new cards are blue,
carry an expiration date and have
a_different coding system than
their predecessors, which did not
differentiate between volunteer
and beneﬁts-receiving employ-
ees. VVhen the new cards went
into effect, some adjunct profes-
sors (who had never qualiﬁed for
the ride-for—free. program, al-
though they didn’t know it) were
surprised to ﬁnd that they could
no’ longer use their I.D.s to ride
for free on Port Authority ve-
hicles.

Pitt regional campus employ-
ees also have complained at be-
ing excluded from the ride—for-
free service. (April 5 University
Times.)

At this month’s meetings of
Faculty Assembly and Senate
Council, several professors pro-

tested that Pitt was showing dis-'

respect to volunteer faculty by

excluding them from the ride-

for—free deal. Psychology pro-
fessor James Holland said that,
whatever it would cost the Uni-
versity to extend ride-for-free to
volunteer faculty, “it would still
be a bargain” considering how
much Pitt beneﬁts from the
teaching and other services those
faculty members provide.

At Senate Council, Chancel-

lor Mark Nordenberg, Provost
James Maher and Executive Vice
Chancellor Jerome Cochran

apologized for any inconve-»

nience and embarrassment vol-
unteer faculty suffered in trying
unsuccessfully to use their new
I.D .s on Port Authority vehicles.

Volunteer faculty (including
nearly 3,000 in the medical
school alone, plus hundreds more
in other units) contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to the University, ac-
cording to N ordenberg, who said
he greatly valued the law school’s
adjunct facultywhen he was dean
of that school. “To the extent
that there were communications
failures or anything else centrally
that interfered with the nurtur-
ing of those relationships, I think
that is too bad,” Nordenberg
said. .
But the chancellor suggested
that the primary payoff that vol-

unteer faculty receive “is the con- ‘

nection with people in their own
discipline and what it means for
them in terms of their own feel-
ings of professional contribution
and accomplishment. __ _

I “I really do think that in terms
of advancing your goal [of fully
appreciating volunteer faculty],
which I happen to agree with,
the most important work is done_
at the unit level,” Nordenberg
said. ,

Staff Association Council tables
resolution to extend ofﬁcer terms

erms of ofﬁce for Staff

Association Council

(SAC) ofﬁcers would

be lengthened from one to two

years, and officers could serve an

unlimited number of consecu-

tive terms, under a proposed

bylaw change that SAC is con-
sidering.

Under current SAC bylaws,
ofﬁcers may be elected to no
more than three consecutive one-
year terms.

SAC voted April 11 to table
the proposal to extend ofﬁcer
terms. A majority of council
members agreed with SAC gov-
ernance committee member
James Jackson that members
hadn’t fully studied details and
implications of the change.

The proposal will be on the
agenda of SAC’s next monthly
meeting, on May 9.

SAC President Rich Colwell I

will ﬁnish his third consecutive
one-year term in June. He ac-
knowledged that the proposed
bylaws amendment wasaimed at
keeping him in ofﬁce, although
Colwell said he hadn’t pushed
for the change himself.

“At least four SAC members
urged me to run again for presi-
dent,” Colwell told the Univer-
sity Times. “I said, ‘I can’t. My
ﬁnal term is expiring.’ They said
to me, ‘We still want you to run.’

_ I said, ‘Then change the bylaws.”’

Colwell said that, if- the’
amendment goes through, he
would stand for ‘re—election
rather than claim he was entitled
to another year in ofﬁce on the

grounds that ofﬁcer terms had
been extended to two years.
No other SAC memberhas
publicly announced plans to run
for the council presidency.
SAC represents non—union—

ized Pitt staff, advises the ad-
ministration on matters affect-
ing staff, and fosters communi-

..cation between staff and‘ other

members of the Pitt community.

my address to the plenary ses-
sion-of the University Senate as
well as the letter by Mr. Robert

‘Hazo (April 5, 2001)‘. My dis-

agreements with Mr. Hazo- are
clearly numerous. Rather than
discuss them here, let me merely
note that passionate, but colle-
gial, dialogue and critique should
be characteristic of academic, in-
deed democratic, discourse. I
question whether Mr. Hazo’s
response to my talk meets that
standard. I would like to respond
to his angry dismissal of my dis-
cussion of Plato’s and Dewey’s
profound differences by quoting
from Steven M. Cahn, a leading
philosopher of education:

“ . . . [of] only two major
philosophers who exempliﬁed
this principle [Kant’s principle
that ‘the greatest and most difﬁ—
cult problem to which man can
devote himself is the problem of
education’] in their philosophi-
cal work, one was Dewey, the
other was Plato. He too [Plato]
found it difﬁcultto discuss any
important philosophic problem
without reference to the appro-
priateness of various subjects of
study, methods of teaching, strat-
egies of learning. \But while
Dewey’s philosophy of educa-
tion rested on his belief in de-
mocracy and the power of scien-

  
 

tiﬁc method, Plato’s philosophy. P

of education rested on his belief
in aristocracy and the power of
pure reason. Pla/to proposed a
planned society, Dewey a soci-

e en a ed in continuous lan— ‘
8 8 P

ning. Plato considered dialecti-
cal speculation to be the means
toward the attainment of truth;
Dewey maintained that knowl-
edge is only acquired through
intelligent action. . . . Sufﬁce it
to say that John Dewey is the
only thinker ever to construct a
philosophy of education compa-
rable in scope and depth to that
of Plato.” — .

I believe that Cahn is cor-
rect: Plato’s philosophy aimed
to achieve aristocratic order,
Dewey’s to achieve democratic
community. I further believe that
American universities would bet-
ter educate students to be moral
citizensof a democratic society
if they put Dewey’s ideas into
practice. As Professor Hazo
surely knows, Plato created his
Academy to help assure rule by
philosopher kings, not citizens.

IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

The April 5 issue of the University Times
contained a fairly lengthy”article‘about the rankings
in U.S. News & World Report of professional
school programs in a number of academic disci-
plines. From what I have seen, rankings are re-
ceived with mixed emotions by those whose schools
or programs are ranked. A good ranking is more
likely to result in a positive View ‘of the U.S. News
 rankings than a disappointing one.

In thinking of rankings, I wondered about the impact, if any,
of the rankings in U.S. News or, for that matter, other rankings
of academic units, on University top administration. For ex-
ample, if a University department or program ranks poorly, does
that assist the unit’s chair in asserting the_ need for greater
resources to enable the unit to rise in the rankings? Or is a poor
ranking taken as an indication of performance failure on the part
of the chair and the faculty in the unit, and grounds to consider
program elimination or a ‘change in leadership? Do the provost
and the senior vice chancellor for the Health Sciences attempt to
determine the reasons for low rankings of units or, where a unit’s
ranking has slipped over the course of three or four years, the
reasons for such a change? '

I have no idea whether University board members attribute
any importance to the U.S. News rankings orother rankings. I
assume some board members come across U.S. News and note
the ranking of various parts of the University. All board members
receive the University Times, which has a story on the U.S.
News rankings every year. I hope the rankings prompt some of
them to note the achievements of the faculty and to search for
ways to encourage and facilitate greater achievements.

As__I understand it, U.S. News prepares its reports to assist
higher education consumers — individuals who will be choosing
educational institutions to which to.apply. The professed objec-

  

tive of U.S. News is not to inﬂuence the educational institutions ,

with regard to their planning and allocation of funds, although
the reports may have such an effect.

Rankings are taken more seriously by some schools and’
programs than by others. Apparently, rankings of business schools
gain greater attention than is the case for some other profes-
sional schools. One reason may be that business schools View
themselves as businesses, with speciﬁc focus on their competitive
position vis_-a—vis the other schools, in attracting students who
will be s'ucc'éssful"iri their ‘professional careers; bring dis“tinc'ti'o‘ii~
to the school and constitute a source of future substantial gifts.

How much does the excellent reputation of an institution
affect its ability to recruit faculty who have already distinguished‘
themselves at less prestigious institutions? Anumber of years ago
I read a very impressive health services research article. The
subject was important, the argument well-founded and the

article well—written. I recommended that its author be contacted .

to become a candidate for an open position at Pitt. I don’t know
whether any contact was made, but she moved on to Harvard
where she became a full professor. Many institutions would have
considered, this person a great asset to their health services
research agenda. An individual who has acquired a ﬁne reputa-
tion will almost certainly have attracted substantial research
support. Funding generally accompanies the faculty member
who moves from one institution to another institution. Thus, the
institution that can recruit the “star” gains the beneﬁts of both
the individual’s reputation and research support. ' ' 1

I noted that Pitt’s Schoolof Medicine was -ranked 20th in the
research grouping of medical schools by U.S. News ‘despite the
fact that it is 9th among medical schools in the amount of funding
receivedfrom the National Institutes_ of Health. Although there
are other sources of research funding for medical schools, my
guess is that criteria other than the amount of research funding
account for Pitt ranking 20th.

‘With regard to use of research funding as a factorin any
ranking process,‘ is the total funding of the unit’s. faculty as
meaningful as the_ funding for full-time faculty of the unit on a
per capita basis? A unit that does relatively poorly on both the
total and per capita research funding ‘bases may assert that
funding is not as useful as other criteria for assessing research
performance and for ranking units in that area of academic
activity. Or, such a unit might state that its mission, established
by faculty and administration in some fashion, does not assign
researcha high priority and that other performance elements,
besides research funding, should be given greater weight in any
ranking process. I ’

A ﬁnal observation about rankings: Some critics of intercol-
legiate athletics assert that applicants for college admission give
more attention to rankings of a, university’s athletic teams than
to its academic teams. ’ I

JOHN

TYMITZ

Theilnstitute for

Shipboard Education  0 0
reflects on Pitt’s 20 years

with Semester at Sea.

During the 1980s, the Pitt-sponsored Semester at Sea
(SAS) study-abroad program was among the ﬁrst to take
large groups of Westernstudents to mainland China and the
former Soviet Union.

In 1994, just two years after America lifted restrictions
against its citizens traveling to Vietnam — and at a time
when the Khmer Rouge holocaust was a recent memory —
SAS began including Vietnam and Cambodia in its ﬁeld
component. .

In 1999, despite the- U.S. trade embargo, SAS added

_ Havana, Cuba, toits ports of call.

What’s next, North Korea? ' ' ‘
“That’s it, you hit on it!” said john P. Tymitz, chief
executive oﬁicer of the Institute for Shipboard Education,

which administers_SAS out  offices in 81.1  Pitt.._..

Union.

Tymitz revealed that SAS is, in fact, consulting with
academicians, State Department oﬂicials and other Asian‘
specialists about the feasibility of visiting that isolated and
impoverished nation, which is closed to fbrei gners except those
approved by the Pyongyang regime. '

“We haven ’t tried to contact North Korean officials yet, ”
Tymitz said. “But world events allow it, we would love to
visit North Korea in addition to South Korea on an upcoming
voyage. We ’re looking at spring or fall 2 003. ”

I/Vhile traditional study-abroad pro grams emphasize one-

or two-semesterstays in the U.K., France, Germany and --

other developed countries, SAS ships undergraduates around
the world on I 00-day (fall and sprin and 65-day (summer)
voyages to places that tourists rarely see.

The spring 2 00] voyage, scheduled to conclude in the port ‘

of S eattle on April 25, has visited Havana; Salvador, Brazil;
Cape Town, South Africa; Mombasa, Kenya; Chennai, In-
dia; Penang, Malaysia; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Hong
Kong; Shanghai, P.R.C., and Osaka, japan. _

The voyage-marks the 20th anniversary of Semester at
Sea at Pitt. The program came here from the University of
Colorado. Under Pitt’s academicsponsorship, 20,153 under-
graduates representing some 1,200 colleges and universities
have studied aboard SAS ’s ‘ﬂoating university, ” which com-
bines at—sea classwork with in—port ﬁeld studies and indepen-
dent travel.‘ 1 '

Tymitz, 59, was a faculty member on the ﬁrst of his dozen
SAS voyages in I 972 and has worked full-time for‘ the
Institute ﬁir Shipboard Education since 1976. A

University TimesAssistantEditorBruce Steele (a veteran
of three SAS voyages) interviewed Tymitz last week.

University Times: Not everyone welcomed Semes-
ter at Sea when Pitt became the program’s academic
sponsor in 1981. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
‘Council complained that it wasn’t consulted about

your curriculum. Do you remember those days?
Tymitz: I remember very well. Our executive direc-
tor and chief academic ofﬁcer at the time also heard all
of the complaints and asked [then-Pitt Chancellor] Wes
Posvar, VVhy don’t you set up a series of meetings with
a faculty group? This committee spent nearly a whole
semester reviewing every aspect of our program. It was
from that effort that the Academic Advisory Committee
wasestablished. The advisory committee is still in exist-

, ence today.

VVhen SAS ﬁrst came here, some criticized it as a
“party ship.” .

   

I‘believe that even in the early 1970s we had a very
serious academic program.‘ There were probably more
difficulties with the student population because of the
times. More students got in trouble, more students
experimented with drugs, more students were sent home
for disciplinary reasons during the 1970s. I believe we
were still offering a very solid academic program. I think
it’s better today as a result of continuous scrutiny, criti-
cism and concerns that we’ve been hearing over the 20
years that we’ve been at Pitt. 7’ —

Among the 439 students who sailed in spring 1981,
only two were African Americans. Only ﬁve of the
43 9 students were from Pitt. How do those ffumbers
compare today? » _ = — -- .

Diversity is deﬁnitely on the upswing. On the cur-
rent voyage, we have 22 African American students. We
have 75 Pitt students on the current voyage, the largest
contingent from any university. This is the ﬁrst time Pitt
has sent more students than any other institution.

It’s fair to say that early on, there was a general sense
that Semester at Sea was ﬁnancially out of reach for Pitt
students. That’s why, in‘our early years here, we insti-
tuted a special scholarship for Pitt students:~They could
go on Semester at Sea for about what it cost them to
attend the University of Pittsburgh, in terms of tuition
plus room and_board. They still had to come up with

some money for their airfare and ﬁeld programs: Of the

ﬁve Pitt students who sailed in spring 1981, three re-
ceived these scholarships.

NOTE: According to Semester at Sea’s financial aid
oﬂice, SAS continues to offer such scholarships (usually, four
$7, 000 scholarships per voyage) to Pitt students. On a typical
voyage, SAS provides 26 work—study grants (which reduce
basic voyage costs by halﬂ, 60 grants of $4,800 each, 25 -3 0
grants of $2, 800 and 1 0-1 2 alumni-funded scholarships.

Traditionalists say that study- abroad should involve
a full semester or academic year in one country or
region, so students can be immersed in a particular
culture. - I , ,

I think every student should study overseas, but I
don’t think they should limit themselves to England,
France, Germany and Australia, which are. the big study-
abroad» countries —— not that there’s anything wrong
with studying in those countries. I’m not going to bad-
mouth immersion programs. I think they’re an out-

standing way for students to learn more about a country _

by living there for a" semester or a year.

But I believe students should be able to see what the
rest of the world has to offer by visiting places like India,
South Africa, Malaysia and Vietnam, which are not

‘ normal stops in any of the traditional study-abroad

programs «right now. We’re ﬁnding that, after students
come off Semester at Sea, they are returning to those
countries to study in greater depth. -

Skeptics ask: How can you do justice to any of these

cultures with a four-to-ﬁve day visit, with as few as .

a couple of days’ preparation?

' VVhat I’d tell the skeptics is that they need to look
carefully at how we prepare students for each country—
through classwork, reading assignments, ﬁlms and the
interport lecturers we bring on to the ship. We do our
best to see that students have a good, basic grasp of each

  

country’s history and socioeconomic situation,
and that they come away with»—a better under-
standing of that country. '

The ﬁrst years -we were at Pitt, we visited as
many as 12 ports during a semester. Now, we’re
trying to stick to nine or 10 ports because we’ve
seen there’s a real need to spend more class—time
at sea as well as more time in each port.

Let’s talk about the safety issue. Students
probably are safer in western Europe and
Australia than they are in the United States,
_but that’s not necessarily true of some of the
countries on the SAS itinerary.’
We tell students and parents from the get-go
thatsafety is our No. 1 concern. In every one of
the countries on our itineraries, we look carefully

State Department brieﬁngs and we hire Pinkerton
Global Assessments to review safety issues for
every country that we go to. Our track record, I
believe, is very, very good. We’ve had one acci-
dent in the 28 years that I’ve been involved with
the program. (On an SAS—sponsored trip in 1996,

killed in a bus crash near Agra, India.)
But that wasn’t the only instance in which

No, but the other deaths were primarily be-
cause students made wrong decisions. They have
been told not to do X, they’ve gone ahead and
/ tried it, and as a result an accident took place that
took their life. For example, we tell students: Don’t
climb the pyramids in Egypt. But some do, and one girl
fell to her death. It’s not something I’m happy about, but
it’s also not something that we ‘were to blame for. Among
the 30,000 students who have sailed on Semester at Sea,
no more than 10 have lost their lives apart from the ﬁve
passengers and two Indians who died in 1996. I

This summer, you’re launching a Law at Sea pro-
gram for law students sailing on SAS. Is this your
ﬁrst specialized program? ' »

The very ﬁrst. We made a few small attempts in the
past, but never like this. This came as the result of [Pitt
law professors] Ron Brand, John Burkoff and [clean]
David Herring, who came to us and said law students
want to study "abroad, too. We’re upto 20 law students
now who are sailings this summer. I would think that
other disciplines like business might be interested in
creating programs like this, _but that’s not something
we’ve explored yet.

Do professors who sail on SAS still tend to be older,
tenured faculty?

It’s kind of a cross-section now, among Pitt faculty.
I think we’ve seen a ripple effect, as faculty who have
sailed on Semester at Sea tell other faculty what their
voyage meant to them.

I had the greatest pleasure, by the way, when Irwin
Schulman applied to be academic dean for a 1994 voy-
age. He had been dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences when we came to‘Pitt in 1981, and he’d made
it pretty clear that he wasn’t happy Semester at Sea was
here. VVhen I met with him about a deanship, I asked:

“Irv, why are you here? I remember days when you ’

weren’t too happy with Semester at Sea.” He said:
“Well, I’ve listened to students and colleagues who have
sailed, and I want to see if I can get that experience, too.”

He ended up being named dean, and did a great job.

Most people understand that Pitt doesn’t own and
operate your program’s ships. But to what extent, if
any, does the University subsidize Semester at Sea?
The University has never, ever been out a nickel to
operate the Semester at Sea program. Every aspect of
the program is administered and operated through the
Institute for Shipboard Education. We pay rent for the
space we use on campus, and for any ofﬁce renovations.
All money that we pay to Pitt goes back to operate the
program in the sense that the academic dean’s salary
comes out of that, the registrar’s salary comes out of
that, the librarian’s salary comes out of that money.

Does Semester at Sea come under ﬁre for seeming
to condone or validate regimes like those in Havana
and Beijing, by visiting those countries?

In a limited way. Not to the extent that people have
screamed and hollered at me over the phone. The people
we’re in touch with seem to be more open—minded.
Nobody’s' ever accused me of running a Marxist or left-
leaning program. I think today, people are forgetting
those old ideological considerations. More than ever,

UNIVERSITY TIMES

  

twasn’t as if Professor Rob-
I ert G. Hazo and Rabbi
Alvin K. Berkun failed to
agree on anything during their
April 10 discussion of “Sharon
and the Arab, Israeli, Palestinian
Conflict.”
Both men said they despair of

a peaceful resolution of the Is— I

raeli—Palestinian conflict, "and
regret the killing on both sides.
I They spoke disparagingly of
both Ariel Sharon, Israel’s newly
elected prime minister, and Pal-
estinian leader Yasir Arafat.
Hazo, director of Pitt’s
American Experience Program,
and Berkun, of Squirrel Hill’s
Tree of Life Synagogue, also
agreed that the deal Israel pro-
posed to Arafat last year — parts
of Jerusalem and most of the
West Bank, in exchange for peace
—— was the biggest concession
theJewish state has ever offered
the Palestinians.
Berkun refused, however, to_

and other places. VVhereas, for
Jews,Jerusalem is the lodestar of
their faith. I

The word “Jerusalem”
doesn’t even appear in the K0-
ran, but the city is mentioned
700 times in the Old Testament
and on virtually every page of
the Jewish prayer book, Berkun
noted. For centuries, each Pass-
over Seder meal and Yom Kip-
pur celebration has concluded
with the words: “Next year in
Jerusalem.” Just as the Koran
calls on Muslims to go on pil-
grimages to Mecca, the Bible
commandsJews to make pilgrim-
ages toJerusalem.

“To hear the propaganda
coming out of the Palestinian
Authority over these last several
months ‘-’-— denying that Jews
have roots inJerusalem, denying
that the Temple Mount is sacred

‘ bringing lasting peace to the

Holy Land: EvacuateJerusalem’s
one-square-kilometer Old City
and obliterate its Jewish, Mus-
lim and Christian holy places.

“I would blow it up and then
I would irradiate all of the dust
so it could not be put in urns and
worshipped,” said an unsmiling
Hazo, who swore he wasn’t kid-
ding. “Maybe atthat point, they
could start talking about human
lives rather than these sacred
symbols.”

' Berkun retorted: -“I didn’t
know that the Mosque of Omar
was held in such low regard as to
be blown up,” referring to the
Muslim Dome of the Rock built

I’ on the site of the Jews’ ancient

Temple of Jerusalem.
Then Berkun re—emphasized

ning of the discussion: For Mus-
lirns,Jerusalem is a holy city, but

focus — is ridiculous,” Berkun
said. '

“The Palestinians have a lot
of legitimate gripes, and I abso-

lutely do not deny those gripes at I

all,” the rabbi said. “But for them
to make up history, in the sense
that I’m hearing lately, is really,
to say the least, disconcerting.”

Hazo didn’t argue theology
or ancient history. “My conten-
tion is very simple: I think that
Ariel Sharon is not prime minis-
ter material” and is virtually in-
capable of facilitating peace,
Hazo said.

He quoted Israeli Army se-
nior ofﬁcers" descriptions of
Sharon as being megalomania-
cal, vulgar, impulsive, reckless,
vain and provocative —- a por-
trait with which Hazo concurred.

He also quoted a German
saying, “Power brings out re-
sponsibility,” and predicted that
Sharon will be surrounded by
aides and cabinet members seek-

ing to modify his policies. “Ihope
that works,” Hazo said, “al-
though my instincts tell me it
will not. At 73 years old, Sharon
is unlikely to change. Also, jhe’s
promised to give [Israel] secu-

. rity, but the ‘means he’s chosen

to deliver security won’t work
because he and other Israeli lead-
ers don’t understand the Pales-
tinian uprising.” -

The Palestinian intifada takes
as its model-the Algerian revolu-
tion, in which 1 million Algeri-
ans perished kicking the French
out of their country, Hazo said.
That same determination and

alists, he maintained.

Berkun questioned the “no—
bility” of Palestinian leaders who
promote terrorism against inno-
cent civilians, demonize Jews,
deny Israel’s right to exist and
incite rock—throwing youths to
take to the streetswhile Pales-
tinian Authority police stand by
doing nothing. ’

“I’ve seen Israelis maimed for
life by those rocks. These are not

pebbles that are being thrown,”

Berkun said — eliciting groans
from pro-Palestinian audience
members, who muttered that
Palestinian rocks often are an-
swered by Israeli bullets.

Berkun said he, too, is sad-.

dened by the killing of Palestin-
ian children. But he added: “How
about the mothers who are send-
ing those children to the front
line, where they don’t belong?

That to me is absolutely destruc-
‘ tive. ” ‘ ‘

During the question—and-an-
swer session that followed the
discussion between Berkun and
Hazo, a young Palestinian
woman accused Berkun of char-

acterizing her countrywomen as

unthinking “animals” who care
nothing for their children.
“Those Words never left my

' mouth,” Berkun replied, hotly.

“I don’t believe it, I don’t think
it, I don’_t feel it, and I resent
your suggesting that that’s what
I had in mind.”

' (The question-and-answer
session echoed recent Arab-Is-
raeli public exchanges: plenty of
rhetoric but no genuine dia-

logue.)

» In a March 5 article, “Ariel
Sharon, Fuel on the Fire,” Hazo
called the Israeli—Palestinian con-
ﬂict “one of the most compli-
cated and agonizing struggles in
human history” and said Sharon’s
surprise ascendancy to power is
likely to make the ‘situation

“much worse.”-

Hazo called Sharon’s peace
proposals to date “pathetically
inadequate: No more than half
of the West Bank for the Pales-
tinians, no part of Jerusalem as

CIDDE — Changing with the times:

Focus is now instructional development  

ichael Arenth
remembers the
days 20.years ago

,when Pitt’s University Center

for Instructional Resources
(UCIR) focused mainly on pho-
tography and overhead projec-
tors, requests were logged and
tracked by hand in log books and
communication was almost ‘ex-

, clusively by phone.

In I995, Provost James V.
Maher established the Center
for Instructional Development
and Distance Education
(CIDDE), which merged UCIR
with the Ofﬁce of Faculty De-
velopment and the University
External Studies Program. Ad-
ditionally, a number of staff -in
instructional computing were
transferred to CIDDE.

Today Arenth, assistant di-
rector of instructional media ser-
vices at CIDDE, oversees a staff

of nine who provide state—of— A

the-art classroom—related ser-
vices including interactive tele-
vision; audio, video and data pro-
jection equipment; satellite_tele-
conferencing services, and Vid-
eotape duplication and conver-
sion capabilities. ‘

Requests for service are taken,

recorded, scheduled and moni-
. tored on—line. Photography now

includes electronic imaging and
digital image manipulation and
restoration services, and instruc-
tional computing pr_ovide_s ‘sys-

tems analysis, multimedia" appli-

cations and instructional web
pages. Distance education sup-
port offers training in designing
course materials and in com-

puter-assisted testing services.

“Now we get more than 2 ,000
‘support events’ to handle per
term, which include providing
set-up and operation services in
individual classrooms and han-
dling special requests by faculty
for staff support for a whole range
of instructional media,” Arenth
said. '—

Arenth’s unit is only one of
10 components of CIDDE, the
University’s main organization
for instructional support and in-
novation. Other parts of CIDDE
include: instructional design, fac-
ulty development, electronic

graphics and design, a faculty‘
instructional development lab,"

instructional computing, pho-
tography and electronic imag-
ing, instructional engineering,

video production and distance

education support services,
which altogether comprise a staff

Two decades later, CIDDE
is not your parents’ UCIR.

According to CIDDE direc-
tor Diane Davis, “There are so
many things that are happening

here today, the best I can ‘ever

give is a snapshot of what’s hap-
pening at a particular time. We’re
having guest lecturers via satel-
lite.'The School of Information
Sciences has shared interactive
courses with the University of
Michigan. We’re opening a new
faculty training lab. We’re using

’ more interactive television for

CIDDE’s mission, Davis said, is

ing technologies that support the
teaching process. A .
“A * perfect example is
CourseInfo,” she said.
CourseInfo, developed by Black-
board, Inc., is a software package
that allows faculty to use web‘
pages for instruction. It features
tools that can administer, grade
and record quizzes and can fa-
cilitate instructors’ efforts to
communicate with students via

the Internet.

“As little as three years ago,
there was nothing here,” Davis
said. “We took out a trial license

-with Blackboard and we were

one of their first two or three
customers, and now they have
about 5,400 and I believe we’re
their biggest customer.”

The University is heavily
committed to staying at the fore-
front of instructional develop-
ment, Davis said. ‘.‘In 1997, Pitt
joinedalearningtechnologycon—
sortium of nine major institu-
tions to share knowled e and
ideas about instructionaif tech-
nology,” she said. ‘

The other universities in the
consortium are Virginia Tech,
Notre Dame, North Carolina,
Indiana, Florida, Geor 'a, Wake
Forest and Delaware. gj‘ »

“VVhen we go to do presenta-
tions at -the consortium, there
are‘ qiiésf.ioﬁs"as iﬁindahieﬁtali as
our organization itself,” Davis
said. “Most frequently, the dis-
tinction we see is that other
schools focus on technology
rather than what we do, which is
to focus on instruction. Other
institutions are not organized
that way. It takes them‘ more
time to pull those resources to-
gether.” .

Arenth said, “We do a lot-
with technology, but we are not
a tech unit.‘We’re not a store;»we
don’t manufacture or sell equip-
ment. We are a unit with a strong
instructional focus.” ‘

Arenth, who is a member of
Pitt’s classroom management
team, added: “I see it _with the
renovation of classrooms: Tech-
nology is not installed just for
technology’s sake; it’s installed

The Center for Instructional
Development and Distance Edu-
cation (CIDDE) has installed a
link to its home page that pro-
vides various views of media-en-
hanced classrooms in 14 build-
ings campus-wide.

Part of an ongoing project to
upgrade classroom instructional
technology, CIDDE links class-
room information to the site as
new technology is installed.

‘The project is done in coop-
eration with the Provost’s class-
room management team, which

and placed with extensive input
from faculty and instructional
designers.” A

Davis said CIDDE has estab-

; lished a network of school liai-

sons, which serves two purposes.
“First, so faculty will know about

our services and,'second, to give c

schools a viable mechanism to
communicate to us their needs

opment.

“Once a year we pull the liai-
sons together for discussion.

Sometimes ideas that come from .'

one school open up ideas for

other schools. Then we develop -

on-line materials for faculty and
set up training sessions.”
Whether ‘faculty take advan-
tage of CIDDE’s services is
strictly optional, she said. “The

decision is in the hands of the

faculty. If I have one message to
say to them, however, it’s that

said, Pitt faculty are open to in-
novative teaching techniques.
“We see that in the case of
CourseInfo, for example, which
[drew so much interest that it]
surprised us.”

One-third of Pitt faculty are
trained in Courselnfo and nearly
half of Pitt’s students have regis-
tered in at least one CourseInfo
section. CIDDE is testing the
latest version of CourseInfo, 5.0.
If all goes well, it will be.up and

instructional needsand obstacles.
VVhen he’s applying technology
to instruction, he’s thinking like
a teacher, not like a technician.”

Laudato, CIDDE’s associate

director for instructional tech-

nology, teaches graduate and
undergraduate courses in the

' School of Information Sciences.

He also holds a Ph.D. in curricu-
lum and supervision.

An example of Laudato’s in-
genuity involved a faculty mem-
ber who uses a wheelchair. Dur-
ing a recent term, the faculty
member was teaching a large lec-
ture class and complained to
CIDDE that he could only reach
the bottom part _ }of the
classroom’s whiteboard and that
students at the back of the lec-
ture hall could not see the notes
he was writing. a '

“So we were facing two prob— __

lems,” Laudato said. “One was
the limitations of the instructor’s
reach and the other was that the
whiteboard, made and sold by
Blackboard, was too small for
the classroom. Blackboard’s busi-
ness is making and selling 10—ft
diagonal boards.”

Laudato had a brainstorm.
He combined available technolo-
gies, hooking up a PC with Smart
Notebook applications that du-
plicated the whiteboard’s capa-
bilities, with the classroom’s

large overhead projector, which

provided a much larger area for
viewing.

What resulted were some
unexpected advantages.

“I think it’s a harbinger of
future classrooms,” Laudato said.
“It’s still a presentation technol-
ogy, but_ there are aspects of this
set—up that provide advantages,
such as not having to block the
class with the instructor’s back
when they’re making notes on a
whiteboard. I can face the class;
I can see their eyes; the class is
more engaged. No one is strain-
ing to see what I've written or
see around my body.”

Additionally, Laudato said,
students don’t need to scribble
down every detail, because the
entire lesson can be saved as a
web page to be accessed outside
the classroom. 5

“You can focus on what’s be-
ing said. Even in a large class-
room, it allows people to see the
image. And you can recover it,
save it, archive it, move back and
forth between pages you’ve cre-
ated, and the students don’t need
to take as many notes, if any,
because they can call up every-
thing that was written down
when they get home to their com-
puter.”

Laudato has dubbed his in-
Vention “Janus,” after the R0-
man god of gates and portals.

With technology evolving
rapidly, are there other such in-
ventions in CIDDE’s future?

Davis said that while direct
support ~ of instruction is
CIDDE’s primary mission, she
hopes to see the center as the
focal point for research projects
on instruction. “We’re like a
laboratory here. VVhere there are
theses and dissertations and re-
search being done on instruc-
tion, we could provide the sub-
jects for study. We’re on the

applied end of instructional re- ’ i I

search, while a school would be
the research unit. I would like to
see more of that kind of project
in the future.”

Two debate over Arab-
Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict

CONTINUED FROM PA GE 4

Sharon visited ]erusalem’s
Temple Mount. His visit is seen
as the spark that touched off the
current intifada. . "
According to Hazo, Sharon

, knew he was provokingviolence. >

According to Berkun, Pales-
tinians used Sharon’s visit as an
excuse for a planned attack.

VVheelbarrows ﬁlled with

A rockswere already in place, :24.

hours before Sharon’s visit, ready
for Palestinians to throw into
the Jewish—adrninistered West-
ern Wall area, said Berkun. As a

Knesset member and an Israeli.

citizen, Sharon had every right
to visit the Temple Mount,
Berkun argued. » —

“That area is not forbidden
to Jews. It is part of Israeli terri-
tory, and certainly_a member of
the Knesset should have the right
to go. It was Arafat who took his
visit there to be the signal for the
masses of Palestinians to go to
the streets,” Berkun said.

Hazo replied: “I don’t think

Ariel Sharon was going to the
Temple Mount in the name of
peace. . . .He.knew that his going
there was a provocation.”
‘ As. for Israelis’ free access to
the Temple Mount, Hazo said:
“There is not one country in the
world -—' not one, including the
United States — that has ever
recognized the annexation of
Jerusalem“ by Israel. ’

Hazo said that prior to the
mid-1990s, he believed the Arab-
Israeli conﬂict would be settled
when one side won, or both
agreed to share the land and make
peace. “I came to the conclusion
some five, six, seven years ago
that it was a terminal struggle,”
he said, “that one side was going
to win and that peace was almost
impossible.”

But the more Hazo thought
about it, two other possibilities

 

  the University community

occurred to him: The struggle
will go on indeﬁnitely, or (more
likely, according to Hazo) both
sides will lose by unleashing
weapons of mass destruction.

“All Israel has to do is knock
out Baghdad, Damascus and
Cairo and it would pretty much
paralyze the Arab world,” Hazo
said.

 .. - .5.‘.AndI.do-. «not for» a minute

think that the Arab countries,
particularly Syria, Egypt and
even Jordan —— certainly Iraq —
do not have weapons of mass
destruction. They do. They’re
not atomic. But they have chemi-
cal and biological weapons that
can be delivered in a suitcase.”

Hazo said he hopes his
doomsday scenario is Wrong.
“But I hear few hopeful argu-
ments.”

Once again, he and Berkun
were on the same page’. ’

“I am not ﬁlled with hope,”
the rabbi concurred. “I am,
frankly, filled with despair at this
point in time.”

C]

In response to a Palestinian
mortar attack on the Israeli town of
Sederot, four miles from the Gaza
Strip border, the Israeli Army this

‘week seized Palestinian-ruled ter-

ritory in Gaza and announced plans
to occupy it indeﬁnitely to protect
against further attacks. But on
Tuesday night, after U. S. Secre-
tary of State Colin Powell had criti-
cized Israel for using “excessive and
disproportionate” force, the Israeli
Army announced that its mission
was complete and hegan withdraw-
zn . _

The withdrawal came less than
two days afteran Israeli airstrike on
a Syrian radar position in Lebanon,
in retaliation for a Hezbollah at-
tack‘ on Israeli forces at Shahaa
Farms. I ~

performance, cleanliness, over-
all quality), size and seating ar-
rangement (number of seats ver-
sus number of students assigned
to the class, overall satisfaction
._with seating arrangement) and
use of available instructional
technologies in the classrooms.
The survey also asks for the
instructor’s.preferences regard-
ing the set up of the teaching
station and podium (freestand-

networked personal computer
should be installed or if the class-
room should accommodate a
laptop. Instructors are asked to
rate the services of the Center

According to Registrar
Samuel Conte, the survey went
out electronically to 1,625 fac-

classrooms.

Conte gave a preliminary re-
port on the survey to the Uni-

11'. “The survey’s only been out
for a week and .we’v’e had 329
faculty respond, about 20 per-

to tabulate any results. Perhaps
after the end of April.”

he University’s major

active capital projects

total more than $2 00

million, according to the associ-

ate vice chancellor for Facilities

Management. That estimate in-

cludes projects that are under

construction, in the design phase

or awaiting construction bids,
said Ana Guzman. '

In calendar year 2000, capital
projects totaling more than $27
million were completed, she said.
Guzman was reporting on the
status pf capital projects as of
March 2001 to the University
Senate’s plant utilization and
planning committee April 11.

Commenting generally on
the capital projects, Guzman told
the PUP committee that the Uni-
versity plans projects with an eye
on saving energy. She said all
new construction projects and
most renovation projects include
the installation of light sensors,
designed to shut off power when

- no one-is using a facility. Sensors

usually pay for the cost of instal-
lation within ﬁve years by lower-
ing utility costs, she said.

The University also has in-
vested in expensive, but cost-
efﬁcient chilled water distribu-
tion systems. Guzman said a new‘
chilled water system has been
installed to provide better ser-
vice to the Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH),
Benedum Hall, Salk Hall and,
eventually, to the Petersen
Events‘Center, currently under
construction. After the comple-
tion of the Petersen Center, set
for early 2002-, a new chilled
water system is expected to be
extended to Trees Hall and
Fitzgerald Field House. The lat-
ter project has not been funded
yet, she said.

The associate vice chancellor
said energy—saving plans call for
the entire Cathedral of Learn-
ing (CL) to be air conditioned.

She said individual window air ‘

conditioners consume more
power than would an internal
system, eventually counter—bal-
ancing the initial installation ex-
penses-

However, she stressed the
project was a long-term plan that
will need to be completed in sev-
eral stages. ‘During the current
ﬁscal year, the state has released
$5 million for installing air con-
ditioning in classrooms on floors
1 through 3, which is scheduled
to be completed within two years.
“As the state releases money for
this project, we’ll do other parts
of the Cathedral,” Guzman said.

Guzman added that the Fa-
cilities Management division is
creating a new unit to be _called
the mechanical maintenance and
energy conservation group,
which will oversee the division’s
building engineers. “As part of
our energy conservation efforts,
we needed to have someone to
read utility meters and look into
some other things, to monitor
consumption of energy, for ex-
ample, even on an hourly basis,
and to see what the University
uses is terms of steam, electricity

‘ and gas, and whatare the peak

times,” she said.

Heart study
receives 2-year
grant

The Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality has
awarded Pitt a two-year,
$368,000 grant to study patients
with acute heart failure. The goal
ofthe project, “A Risk Stratifica-
tion Rule for Heart Failure,” is
to derive a clinical guideline to
help identify patients who are at
low risk for\short-term mortal-
ity and morbidity.

This guideline will assist in
physician decision—making and

‘ limit variability in practice, es-

pecially the decision to admit.
Donald Yealy, professor of
emergency medicine and medi-
cine, UPMC Presbyterian, and
Thomas Auble, research assis-
tant professor of emergency
medicine, are the study’s princi-
pal and co—pri-ncipal investiga-
tors, respectively.

Other investigators are: Wil-
liam Gardner, professor of
medicine and psychiatry; Steven
Reis, associate professor of medi-
cine; Margaret Hsieh, instruc-
tor of emergency medicine, and
Arthur" Feldman, professor of

medicine.

dedicated to saving limbs dam-

aged by diabetic complications,
trauma and peripheral vascular
disease.

The program is a collabora-
tion of vascular, orthopaedic,
plastic and trauma surgeons and
specialists in infectious disease.

“Although some patients may

_ be told by their physician that

they have no recourse but to

have their foot or leg amputated, .

many limbs can be saved with
aggressive medical management
and surgery,” said David Steed,
professor in the Division of Vas-
cular Surgery at Pitt’s School of
Medicine and director of the new
program at UPMC Presbyterian.
“Our center hopes to reduce the
amputation rate for severely
damaged limbs.”

A recent study published in
the journal Diabetes Care re-
ported on the dramatic increase
in the incidence of diabetes in
the United States from 1990 to
1998. Diabetes can cause severe
complications including difﬁ—
cult—to-treat foot ulcers, which
can lead to foot or leg amputa-
tion. It is responsible for more
than 40 percent of all non—trau—
matic amputations in the United
States. Other causes for amputa-

tion are trauma and ischemic dis— ’

ease.

The UPMC program fea-
tures a research component that
gives patients access to clinical
trials looking for new methods
and treatments to prevent am-
putation.

“In the past several years
alone, there have been a number
of promising topical agents to

treat chronic wounds such as dia-
betic skin wounds, pressure sores
and wounds from poor circula-
tion,” said Steed, who is a na-
tional leader in performing clini-
cal trials of new wound healing
agents for difficult—to—treat
wounds that can eventually re-
sult in amputation if not treated
aggressively. C

Professors
developing
biological and
chemical
weapons
detoxification
coating

The Department of Defense,
through The Defense Advanced
Research V Project Agency
(DARPA) and The Army Re-
search Office, has awarded a $5 .6
million grant to Pitt and two
partners to develop a thin poly-
mer coating for vehicles to de-
tect and deactivate chemical and
biological agents.

The research project will be
led by Pitt R.K. Mellon Profes-
sor of Chemistryjohn T. Yates
]r., and will be cooperatively
carried out at Pitt, Kansas State

‘ University, and Texas A&M
~ University, under the Defense

Department’s Multidisciplinary
University Research Initiative
(MURI). The grant is one of the
largest under this year’s MURI
program.

“We are seeking novel ways
to protect personnel from chemi-
cal and biological agent attack,”

said Yates, who holds a dual ap-
pointment in the chemistry and
the physics and astronomy de-
partments, and directs the Pitts-
burgh Surface Science Center.
“A combination of biochemis-
try, solar—driven photochemis-
try, and surface chemistry will
be employed to detect and de-
stroy agent materials.”

Yates will be joined by Pitt
professors Alanj. Russell, chair-
person of the chemical and pe-
troleum engineering depart-
ment, and Hrvoje Petek of the
physics and astronomy depart-
ment, alongwith professors from
Kansas State and Texas A&M.
The group will probe the details
of biochemical and chemical pro-
cesses using methods ranging
from surface spectroscopies to
genetic engineering to nano-sci-
ence.

The project builds on exper.-
tise at Pitt and the other univer-
sities in surface chemistry and
physics, biochemical engineer-
ing, and nanometer—sized mate-
rials. _

“The research findings are
expected to extend far beyond
military applications, leading to
thin ﬁlm coatings that can be
used on many commercial sur-
faces for chemical and bacterial
decontamination,” Yates said.

through the Department of
Defense’sMultidisciplinaryUni-
versity Research Initiative
(MURI) and the Air Force Of-
fice of Scientiﬁc Research.

The grant, for $250,000 per
year, is for three years, with a

possible two-year renewal, for a ’

total of$l.25 million.

“As the air and space forces
evolve in the 21st century, the
need for increased numbers of
spacecraft, including manned
vehicles and satellites, with con-
tinually improving capabilities
and durability, becomes impera-
tive,” Yang said. “Our aim is to
predict materials and surface
degradation in the low Earth
orbit environment through a
uniﬁed effort combining theory
directly with experiments where
primary degradation mecha-
nisms are investigated in situ.”

The team will study atomic
oxygen surface reactions with
ultra—high vacuum transmission

electron microscopy and X—ray I

diffraction at the Advanced Pho-
ton Source at Argonne National
Lab, and surface science tech-
niques at Pitt’s Surface Science
Center. These experiments will
be correlated with theoretical
modeling and simulations of

‘these interactions to provide a

unique opportunity to advance
substantially the knowledge base
of the fundamental mechanisms
of degradation in space environ-
ments.

sarcoma
associated
Ilerpesvirus
causes no ill
effects in
HIV-negative
people

New research at Pitt shows
that a recently discovered herp-
esvirus, which often leads to
Kaposi’s sarcoma in HIV -posi-
tive people, has no negative ef-
fect on healthy HIV-negative
adults. The study is published in
the April 15 issue of Blood, a
journal of the American Society

, of Hematology. . -

Researchers at the Graduate
School of Public Health found
that human herpesvirus 8
(HHV8), often a precursor to
the blood vessel cancer Kaposi’s
sarcoma (KS) in HIV —positive
adults,icauses no symptoms or
only a mild ﬂu-like illness in
healthy adults without HIV, and
has no negative effects on their
immune systems. .

“This is the ﬁrst study to

, unravel the natural history of

primary HHV8 infection in the

absence of underlying HIV in- '

fection or organ transplanta-
tion,” said lead author Charles

Rinaldo, professor of pathology‘

and infectious diseases and mi-
crobiology. “Knowing how
HIV-negative, otherwise healthy
individuals respond to this virus

‘in terms of symptoms and im-

mune responses is important in
preventing related diseases.”

In a previous study, Rinaldo
showed that HIV-infected
people have a poor immune re-
sponse to HHV8, which he says
is likely the reason they are at
high risk ofcontractingKS;This
type of cancer can bevery ag-
gressive in HIV-infected indi-
viduals and in organ transplant
recipients; a milder, rare form of
KS occurs in some older men.

“Our current study shows
that healthy adults produce T
cells and antibodies that we be-
lieve_ control the first-time
HHV 8 infection,” said Rinaldo.
“The only signs of disease that
we see, if any, are transient, ﬂu-
like symptoms.” Like all herpes-
viruses, HHV 8 remains, but in a
latent form, after the initial in-
fection. .

In addition, the study dem-
onstrates that HHV8 infection
causes no negativechanges in a

patient’s immune system, which ,

is not the case with other, similar

herpesviruses such as Epstein-
Barr virus, the cause of infec-
tious mononucleosis.

Rinaldo and his research team

. screened blood specimens taken

over the past 15 years from 108
men participating in the Pitt
Men’s Study. They found ﬁve

HIV -negative men who became I

infected with HHV8 during that
period. _. .

A_review of these patients’
clinical records showed that
around the time of infection they
experienced fatigue, enlarged
lymph nodes, mild fever, diar-
rhea and/or mild skin rash. All
symptoms were temporary, and
the ﬁve men had no lingering
changes in their health.

Moreover, the men had a
strong immune response to the
virus" during the ﬁrst few years of
HHV8 infection that eventually
subsided as the virus was con-

. trolled. This included formation

of killer T cells and antibodies
directed against different pro-
teins made by the virus.

The ﬂu—like symptoms and
anti-HHV8 immune responses
were not found in HIV -negative
men who did not have primary
HHV8 infection and who were
examined at the same time by
clinicians. .

“VVhile our study showed that
ﬁrst-time HHV8 infection is ei-
ther asymptomatic or associated
with several different mild, ﬂu-
like symptoms, many more cases
of HHV 8 infection must be ana-
lyzed before we can say deﬁni-
tively what speciﬁc clinical syn-

drome the virus causes in healthy _

adults,” Rinaldo said.

To follow up on the current
study, he and his research team
havebegun looking at how an
HIV-positive patient’s impaired
immunity can lead to KS, and
they are developing ways of
boosting immunity to impede
that progression. f

“We hope that this research
will eventually lead to a vaccine
for prevention of HHV8,” he
said. This project, too, is part of
the Pitt Men’s Study. Directed

by Rinaldo, the Pitt Men’s Study ~

is the Pittsburgh site of the

(MACS), one of the longest—run—

UPCI tackles

head 8:. nec

cancer ' "
Survival rates for patients

withghead and neck cancer are ' ,
low and have remained relatively

unchanged over the past 30' years.
Treatment options are limited,
and often leave the patient dis-
abled and disﬁgured, unable to_
speak or swallow properly.

‘A patient’s best hope for sur-
vival, and an adequate quality of
life, is through early detection
and treatment of head and neck
cancer. In an effort to improve
the quality of patients’ lives and
increase survival rates, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute’s Head and Neck Can-
cer Program announced a new
initiative April 10 for preventing
and treating this disease.

' Heading these efforts will be
the newly recruited DongMoon

~ Shin. As co—director of the Head

and Neck Cancer Program, he
will coordinate new and ongo-
ing efforts in developing meth-
ods to prevent new and recur-
rent cancers such as vaccines,
gene therapy and immuno-
therapy.

Shin is one of the few medical
oncologists in the world who has

dedicated his career exclusively

to the study of headand neck
cancer. UPCI is one of the few
comprehensive cancer centers to
provide a program with a focus
on head and neck oncology.
The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center (UPMC) has
received worldwide recognition

for its work in the surgical treat-
ment of head and neck cancers
and» for research studies identi-
fying biological markers, which
allow for targeted therapies for
‘head and neck cancer. New in-

terdisciplinaryinterventions will I

incorporate basic and transla-
tional research, gene therapy and
medical oncology with tradi-
tional surgical and radiation
treatments maximizing the po-
tential for new discoveries. These
therapies, along with treatment
and rehabilitation services pro-
vided by Pitt’s Voice Center and
Swallowing Disorders Center
will maximize the potential‘ for
new discoveries, improving pa-
tient care and patient quality of
- life. ' .
’ Shin joins Jennifer Rubin

Grandis as UPCI Head and,
NeckCancerProgram co—direc-
tOI‘. .
Shin said: “We are in a very
exciting time in the treatment of
head and neck cancer. If we think
of ﬁghting cancer as a war, for
years we only had one option,
one ‘Army’ to ﬁght head and
neck cancer. That was surgical
resection of the tumor and ra-
diation therapy. Now we can
utilize a variety of therapeutic
strategies: surgery, radiation,
gene therapy, molecular targeted
therapy and chemoprevention.
We now have the Army, the
Navy, the Air Force and the
Marines,” , ‘

at UPMC Presbyterian Hospi-
tal on April 5 as part of a na-
tional, multi-center trial seeking
to evaluate whether the robotic
system can be helpful to sur-
geons and be safely used for sur-
gical connection of the left in-
ternal mammary artery graft to
the left anterior descending ar-
tery.

The ZEUS had been used in "
32. patients at three centers as
part of a phase one trial, but in all
of these cases, the operation in-
volved the use of a heart/lung
machine while surgeons oper-
ated on a stopped heart.

Marco A. Zenati, assistant
professor of surgery and princi-
pal investigator at the Pittsburgh
site, operated the robot while
seated at a console about 10 feet
from the patient. One arm of the
robot, which responded to his
voice commands, positioned the
endoscope, an instrument with a
tiny camera that magniﬁes the
operative site up to 10 to 15
times. VVhile viewing the mag-
niﬁed image of the heart and
vessels on a high—resolution

monitor, Zenati controlled the
action of surgical instruments
attached to the two other ro-
botic arms by operating handles
that resemble conventional sur-
gical instruments, in much the
way joysticks are used to control
the action of a video game.

" “ZEUS is designed‘ to give a
surgeon greater precision while
performing microsurgical tasks,
and to be able to use it during a
beating heart operation is quite
signiﬁcant. Essentially, it may
allow surgeons to perform su-
perhuman tasks, because the ro-
bot overcomes our dexterity and
precision limitations,” Zenati
said. a

Hand movements of the sur-
geon are , scaled. For instance,
one inch of movement by the
surgeon results in a 1/4 inch

_ movement by the robotic surgi-

cal instruments. Hand tremor is
ﬁltered by the computer and
translated via the robotic arms
into precise micro movements at
the operative site.

“The use of robotics for car-
diac surgery is anextremely ex-

citing development for the ﬁeld.
It is anticipated that the future
will soon see all cardiac proce-
dures employing such technol-
ogy, and surgery will become
less and less invasive for the pa-
tient,” said Bartley P. Grifﬁth,
Henry T. Bahnson professor of
surgery and chief, Division of
Cardiothoracic Surgery at Pitt’s
School of Medicine. Grifﬁth is a
co—investigator of the study and
assisted Zenati during the op-
eration._

awarded this year, each totaling
$35,000.

Grants to UPCI investiga-
tors all focus on the role of estro-
gen in breast cancer, including
biochemical, genetic and tissue
studies that should improve the
understanding of breast cancer
risk and the development of
highly speciﬁc hormone—based
therapies against this disease.

the film’s authenticity, and the
way it explores the meaning be-
hind Foster’s music. “They took
pains to get a sense of Foster’s

- milieu —- his concerns aboutnhis

life and career,” Root said. “They
delvedmuch more into the mind
of the man, and they took on
what many other ﬁlmmakers
have apparently avoided — a se-
rious look at the ways in which
Foster’s music was‘ later inter-
preted and ma..d_e,t0 mean differ:

ent “things.” They looked very V

carefully at how 20th-century
culture ‘racialized’ a lot of the
music, when in Foster’s own time
it was a matter of class, not race,
that he was criticizing.”
According to Root, the opin-
ion that some of Foster’s lyrics
perpetuate racial" stereotypes
could not be further from the
truth. “In fact, Foster was trying

to show a common humanity;

He tried to get people in genteel
homes to sing those lyrics and
embrace them as their own. And
so, slowly, they would take on"
the notion that these slaves’ con-
cerns are their own concerns.” I

-condom use actually increased

the risk of infection in this group
of women.”

PID is a common condition
in which microorganisms spread
from the lower genital tract to
infect and inﬂame the upper
genital tract, including the en-
dometrium, fallopian tubes, ova-
ries and peritoneum. Women
with PID have elevated rates of
infertility, ectopic pregnancy and

chronic pelvic pain. ‘ ~

Previous studies testing the ‘

ability'of various contraceptive

methods to protect against PID

showed inconsistent results, per-

haps due to the inclusion of
women both with and without
symptoms, and the use of older,

higher-dose oral contraceptives

in the studies. .

The Pitt—led study looked at
contraceptive use among 5 63
women who had signs and symp-
toms of PID and who were en-
rolled in the PID Evaluation and
Clinical Health Study, a random-
ized clinical treatment trial. I
