tee to consider whether the Uni-

eﬁts to partners of gay and les-
bian faculty and staff.

‘ According to a May 29 Pitt

_. announcement, “The group will
_ report its ﬁndings and recom-

mendations to the chancellor at
the conclusion of the study.” No
further details were available. -
“As for the speciﬁcsand the
deadlines — some ‘of Which, I

th'e-chanc‘ellor’s ofﬁce,” said
committee chairperson William
Lieberman, a Pitt trustee and
executive vice president of Hilb,
Rogal & Hamilton Co., a risk
management ﬁrm.

A spokesperson for Chancel-
lor Nordenberg said only that
“the committee hasn’t met yet,
so a public discussion of its role

-~would be premature at this

point.” _

The American Civil Liber-

L ties Union (ACLU), which rep-

resents seven current and former
Pitt, employees suing the Uni-
versity over denial of health ben-
eﬁts for their same—sex partners,
has agreed to “temporarily sus-

’ pend” litigation while the com-

mittee does its work. Pittsburgh
ACLU’ Director Witold
Walczak said his organization

, will “reassess the need for con-

tinuing the litigation after the
committee issues its recommen-

dation.” .

“Pitt ‘also has agreed _not to
pursue litigation in the case. This
moratorium on legal action by
both sides “opens the way to a
full and impartial exploration of
the ramiﬁcations and implica-
tions of the policy options avail-
able to the University,” accord-

J. Wray Connolly, outgoing
chairperson of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees, was consulted in the
appointment of Lieberman and
Mosier to the committee, said
board secretary Robert

ken in opposing the extension of
Pitt health beneﬁts to same-sex
partners unless the University is
legally forced to do so. _On]uly1,
William S. Dietrich will succeed
Connolly as board chairperson.
Dietrich was a Carnegie Mellon
University trustee in May 2000
when the Carnegie Mellon board
voted to extend beneﬁts to its
employees’ domestic partners.
Dietrich has declined to dis-
cuss the issue or how he voted.
However, some members of the
Pitt community have speculated
that the leadership change on
Pitt’s board might open the way’
for extending health beneﬁts to
same—sex partners here.‘
Dunkelman disagreed. “I
don’t think the. change in chair-
men makes a difference,” he said.
Plaintiffs, Pitt ofﬁcials and
members of the University com-
munity were unanimous in wel-
coming the Pitt-ACLU agree-

questioned why it was so long in

comments

To the editor:

VVhen I ﬁrst read University
of Pittsburgh’s American Expe-
rience Program Director Rob-
ert Hazo’s call for the destruc-
tion of Jerusalem’s holy sites in
the student newspaper, I was
shocked into silence. Again, I
read Hazo’s comments in the
UniversityTimes (April 19), and
I again turned away in silence.
Specifically, Hazo states: “I
would blow it [theJewish, Chris-
tian and Muslim religious sites]
up and then I would irradiate all
of the dust so it could not be put
in urns and worshipped.” That
the University Times provides
Mr. Hazo another opportunity
(May 3) to inﬂame prompts me
to speak out against this man’s
hateful inciterrient.

Firstly, for a professional as-
sociated with the University of
Pittsburgh to publicly call for
the destruction of religious sites
does not bring honor to this in-
stitution. This is incitement.
Hazo’s words must be taken se-
riously. No sophistry can make
his comments acceptable or ap-
propriate. Words must be taken

seriously, just as the_numerous .

legalistic claims in the PLO Cov-
enant, adopted in 1968 and un-
amended even in 2001, that calls
for the destruction of theJewish
state must be taken seriously.
When there are Arabs blowing
themselves up on buses and
crowded markets, when the
imans from Gaza City to To-
ledo, Ohio, call for jihad against
the Jews, when Jewish children
are selected to be shot or stoned
to death, Hazo’s comments must
be taken seriously. The sad fact
is that while Jerusalem was un-
der Arab occupation from 1948
to 1967 there was widespread
destruction ofJewish cemeteries
and synagogues. Destruction of
Jewish temples and religious sites
(e.g. Joseph’s' Tomb) has re—oc‘—
curred during the past nine
months of Arab violence. Thus
the call by Hazo is not a fantasy.
Such calls for violence must be

sity of Pittsburgh to repudiate
his ‘remarks. A professor’s' call
for violence against~African

Americans, homosexuals or

women wouldnot be tolerated
for one second. VVhy should
there be tolerance for the public
call by a_University employee
for the destruction of Judaism’s
most holy site? ’
Hazo defends Yasir Arafat, a
man who ordered the murderof
American black diplomat Moore
in Sudan, who calls for jihad
“with ﬁre and blood” against

Jews, and who has stolen billions

of dollars from world govern-
ments. In point No. 3 of his may
3 letter, Hazo de facto condones
terrorism, lamenting at its inef-
ﬁciency in causing Israeli casual-
ties. Writing from the comfort
of the Oakland campus (free from
Palestinian sniper attacks, am-
bushes or bombings), Hazo’s
acceptance of terrorism is cow-

ardly and does great injustice to _

the reputation of the University
of Pittsburgh.

Hazo ﬁnds perverse joy in
writing that the “great promise
of Zionism was security buf Is-

rael has never been secure.” The .

Arab countries attacked Israel in
1948, vowed to push it into the
Mediterranean Sea in 1967, and

launched _a multi-front‘ war_

   

against Israel on Yom Kippur in
1973. The Arab countries and
the*PLO have viliﬁed and de-
monized Jews and the Jewish
state. They have boycotted. They

‘have invaded. They have with

pre-meditation murdered
women and children. They re-
vere the suicide bombers as mar-
tyrs. They educate their chil-

dren to propagate hate andvio-

lence againstJews. Theyuse their ’

children as shields for their at-
tacks against Jews. As long as
Palestinian terrorists strap sticks
of dynamite around their bellies
and board buses in downtown
Tel Aviv, as long as Arab leaders
and imans call for a jihad for a
greater Palestine, free ofJews, as
long as Arab textbooks, newspa-
pers, radio and television (funded
by American foreign aid) teach
racism and call for violence
againstJews, as long as “reason-
able people” in the West like
Hazo engage in diatribes, not
dialogue, the violence and blood-

shed in the Middle East will con— .

tinue. Hazo’s comments are in-
appropriate, inexcusable and in-
tolerable, and they should be
viewed as such by the Univer

sity. \ A

Associate Professor

Robert Hazo, director. of Pitt’s American Eocperience Program, responds:

1. Whether my call to de-
stroy all the religious sites in the
old city is taken rhetorically or
literally, the obvious point made
is that all of the bricks, stones,
mortar and metal involved are
not worth one human life. Pro-
fessor Corey, while urging us to
take words seriously, does not
take mine seriously when he as-
sociates my words urging the
destruction of things with the
words of others who advocate

A the taking of lives‘. His doing so

in an instance of the very soph-
istry he purports to condemn.
2. Professor Corey say, “Hazo
defends Arafat.” I refer him to
page 4 of the April 19 issue of the
University Times. There he will
ﬁnd a report on the Hazo-Berkun

discussion which includes the

following statement: “Hazo said,-
‘I am not a defender of Yasir
Arafat.’” “

3. Regarding terrorism, my

mention of the large disparity"

between the number of Israeli
casualties and those of the Pales-
tinians was not to make the point

Professor Corey attributed to

me; If terrorism is deﬁned as the
use of coercive force, including
deadly force, on non—cornbat—
ants for political purposes, then
it certainly appears that the Is-
raelis also engage in terror. I am
thinking_of the number of Pales-
tinian women and children who
are dead or wounded and espe-
cially of the victims of the vigi-
lante groups of Israeli settlers.
Those who use buzz words
like “pro—terrorist” or, “anti—
Semitic” irresponsibly shame

themselves and dishonor the‘ .

cause they purport to defend.
When appropriate, such calumny
and defamation should be coun-
tered by institutional or legal
redress.

4. Finally, Professor Corey
associates what_I said with those
who vilify and demonize Jews
and deplores the fact that I en-
gage in “diatribes, not dialogue.”
I suggest he contact Rabbi
Berkun who, I believe, thinks
our exchange was a dialogue.
Professor Corey should have
been there; he might have
learned something. I

I was very pleased to learn from Chancellor
Nordenberg, a month prior to the public an-
nouncement on May 22, that an arrangement had
beenreached between the plaintiffs in the same—
sex partners health beneﬁts litigation and the
University, to place the litigation on hold, thus
making possible the chancellor’s appointment of a
committee to comprehensively examine the sub-
ject and to recommend to him a course of action.
The University Senate an_ti—discriminatory policies committee,
chaired by Anne Medsger, had proposed last year the establish-
ment by the chancellor of such a committee, and the Faculty
Assembly had unanimously endorsed the proposal.

Assuming the chancellor’s committee recommends provid-
ing such beneﬁts, and the chancellor accepts the recommenda-
tion and begins to act upon it, the chancellor will have to deal
with the possibility of retaliation, through the state appropriation

IVIATT

_ process that has been threatened by some legislators. I,__.ha_ve great

conﬁdence in the chancellor’s negotiation -skills and I know he is
highly respected by the governor and the legislative leadership.
He will need to enlist the active support of the chief executives
of Penn -State and Temple in his efforts at the state level.
Those of us at who advocate granting health beneﬁts to same— '

sex partners need to support him.as he deals with this issue.

Approximately ﬁve years ago I learned of a dispute at Califor-
nia University of Pennsylvania, a public university, between a‘
faculty member and the institution’s president over a course
grade change. This conﬂict led to the ﬁring of the faculty
member who sought arbitration and eventually succeeded in
regaining his position and recovering lost salary. However, he
recently lost his lawsuit brought because of the ﬁring, on the
basis that he did not have a constitutional right of expression
through the grading procedures of the university, thus no viola-
tion of his constitutional rightshad occurred.

I had become intrigued by this dispute because, although I
had not at the time ever received a speciﬁc request to change a
course grade, I had had, as practically every faculty member has
had, students come to see me’ to express their dissatisfaction with
their grades. I began to wonder whether there were any explicit
policies at the University of Pittsburgh concerning changing

. course ades, a art from “I” and “G” _ades.
ST P ST

After I learned of the court decision in the California, Univer- .
sity of Pennsylvania dispute, I became concerned for others, as
well as myself, in connection with policies and criteria for
changing course grades.,Apparently there is no University—wi'de
policy apart from the brief statements in the Undergraduate
Bulletin and the Graduate and Professional Bulletin. The key
language of both statements is:‘ Only the instructor of a course
may change a_ student’s grade by submitting a Change of Grade
Card. All grade changes require the authorization of the dean of
the school from which the original grade was issued.

Subsequent to the December 2000 grading period, I received
requests from two students to have course grades changed. Both
students believed that the low grades I had given them might
prevent them from earning degrees from the University. I
declined to make the requested grade changes or to assign
additional work to lay the foundation for an improved grade. As
it turned out, both students were mistaken with regard to the
effect of the poor grade from me on their academic situation.

I spoke with faculty at several schools of the University and
decided course grade change was a subject that needed study. I
referred the subject to Jacqueline Lever, chair of the University
Senate student affairs committee in March, who promptly began
a committee investigation by soliciting from the schools of the
University the policies or rules that related to the process and
criteria for changing grades” in their schools/. , " 4

On May 22, Professor Lever, on behalf of her_ epmmittee,
submitted a report summarizing the information from most of
the schools. The report also contains several reco endations.
I was extremely pleased with‘the manner in whic. Professor
Lever and her .committee responded to my request,.and with the
content of the report. A  

I believe the subject deserves further attention. For example,
there could be a single University policy on grade changes with
speciﬁc guidance. Or, there could be a policy that authorizes
each school to establish its own policy containing criteria" and.
process for changing course grades. Fairness would appear to
require some basic consistency within the University. It is also
important for a policy to indicate speciﬁcallythe steps to be
followed by students seeking to obtain a change of grade, and the
extent of intervention allowed to a clean where the student and
thefaculty member have not resolved a dispute over a grade.

If schools are going to have the authority to establish policies
for grade changes, their content should be made explicit to
faculty and students. If a student seeking to have his/her course
grade raised is given the opportunity by the instructor to per-
form additional work, all students in that course should have that
opportunity. A schoollpolicy that appears to encourage requests ’
for grade changes might generate many requests to faculty who
are not generous with high grades, and this could lead to
considerable friction. I_ intend to recommend to my successor,

James Cassing, that the subject be given additional attention] S

the complaint. 

Common Pleas Judge Rob-
ert C. Gallo found no evidence
of intentional discrimination. He
ruled that Pitt’s denial of health
insurance to the plaintiffs was
‘based on their marital status, not
sexual orientation.

One of the seven plaintiffs,
Mark S. Friedman, recalled re-
cently: “After the Gallo ruling,
we discussed options with our
attorneys. We could either ap-
peal the case at the Common
Pleas level or pursue it to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court.”
Either way, the discrimination
lawsuit faced a long, uncertain
future.

Then, in a meeting last Au-
gust, ACLU lawyers presented
plaintiffs with a third option:
Suspend the lawsuit and negoti-
ate with the University.

“The attorneys said it was up
to us, that they would pursue the
legal battle if we did not want to

_go through negotiations,” said

Friedman, a staff member in
Pitt’s infectious diseases and
microbiology department. “I was
very supportive of suspending

_ the legal activity.”

Other plaintiffs weren’t so
sure. RayAnne Lockard, head of
the Fri_ck Fine Arts Library, re-
membered: “VVhen we were told
of the option to negotiate, I was
upset because I know howlongit
takes to get things done at this
University. On the one hand, I
knew we needed to negotiate.
On the other hand, I said, ‘Here

"we gofanother two or three‘ "

m _

years... _ V
Ultimately, plaintiffs autho-
rized their attorneys to workwith
Pitt lawyers‘ on a compromise.
“All of us [plaintiffs] agreed
that it was the right thing to do,”

‘said Deborah Henson-, a former

Pitt legal writing instructor who
now is a private practice attor-
ney in New Orleans.

“If the litigation had gone
smoothly in our favor, which
rarely happens for anyone, we
probably would have pressed on
with our case,” she acknowl-
edged. “But even when litiga-
tion goes in your favor, it’s very
slow. Things get docketed

‘slowly, they have to be argued

and briefed.”
Cl

Henson initially tried to work
within the University systemiin
seeking spousal health coverage
for her lesbian partner. She had
applied for stfch beneﬁts in sum-
ays after starting
work at Pi.tt7;:~’ and was surprised
to learn that the University didn’t
extend health beneﬁts to same-

" sex partners.

“Actually,” Henson said in a
1999 University Times inter-
view, “some of the faculty at the
law school had told me that I
could sign up for beneﬁts, be-
cause there had been. all of the
press about the domestic part-
nership registry that was estab-

lished in 1993” to provide lim— 9

ited beneﬁts (including bereave-
ment leave, tuition reduction and
library borrowing privileges) for
same—sex partners.

Henson appealed for help to
the University Senate anti—dis-
criminatory policies committee,
which studied the situation and
urged Pitt’s administration to

offer health beneﬁts to employ-
ees’ same—sex partners.

After 18 months without suc-
cess, Henson sued Pitt. In a com-
plaint before the city Human
Relations Commission, she
charged that the University vio-
lated the city’s anti—discrimina-
tion ordinance by denying equal
beneﬁts to gay and heterosexual
partners. Six current Pitt em-
ployees subsequently joined
Henson in a classaction suit,

Pitt lawyers asked the com-
mission to dismiss the complaint,
arguing that: (1) the University’s
health insurance does not dis-
criminate based on sexual orien-
tation; (2) while’ Pitt restricts
spousal health coverage to mar-
ried couples, marital status is not
covered under the city’s anti-
discrimination law; and (3) the
remedy Henson sought was pre-
empted, or contrary to, state law,
and the Pittsburgh commission
lacks jurisdiction to order it.

This last argument — that
Pennsylvania municipalitieslack
the legal authority to pass anti-
discrimination’ laws exceeding
state laws -—- triggered a public
controversy pitting faculty gov-
ernance groups, city ofﬁcials and

student hunger strikers against’

Pitt administrators and trustees.

Protesters accused University I

leaders of to undercut le-
gal protections for gay and'les-
bian Pittsburghers. Pitt ofﬁcials
said they weren’t attacking the

‘city law, only defending the

wrong:lh'eade‘d“lega1'claim‘; . K

In November 1999, state leg-
islators passed a law exempting
public universities from local
ordinances that would force them
to provide health beneﬁts to
same—sex couples. ~

The following April, Allegh-
eny County Judge Gallo ruled
that the state law superceded the
Pittsburgh Human Relations
Commission’s jurisdiction in
what had come to be called “the
Henson case.” ' P

But while Pitt was scoring
legal victories, a growing num-
ber of other local employers, in-
cluding Carnegie Mellon and
Chatham College (both private
institutions, Pitt ofﬁcials pointed
out), began offering same—sex
health beneﬁts. ‘

Cl

Last A spring, the University
Senate anti—discriminatory poli-
cies committee, proposed a way
out of Pitt’s legal and public re-
lationsmorass. It urged creation

of a joint committee of faculty,

administrators, trustees and oth-
ers to consider whether the Uni-
versity should extend health ben-
eﬁts to same—sex partners.
Faculty Assembly endorsed
the idea, citing the precedent of
a similar committee that had
addressed Pitt’s policy on South
Africa—related investments. ”
Chancellor Nordenberg had
served on the latter committee.
He told Senate Council on June
12: “I did see good come out of
that process then, butI also know
that what can happen. . .is shaped
to a considerable extent by the
environment in which that dis-
cussion takes place.” .
Nordenberg called the on-
going lawsuit against Pitt “a
major. impediment to engaging

logue that the [anti—discrimina-
tory policies] committee is seek-
ing.” . .
But the chancellor did not
rule out establishing a joint com-
mittee if plaintiffs agreed to call
off their lawsuit. '
Anthony Silvestre, spokes-

person for the Equal Rights Al-.

liance that opposed Pitt’s stance
on same—sex beneﬁts, was among
those who picked up on last
spring’s peace feelers. “When
[Faculty Assembly] suggested
that the parties work together to
put together a committee to deal
with this issue, similar to the way
the University dealt with divest-

ing from South Africa, I thinkwe '

felt that the tide had turned,”
said Silvestre, an assistant pro-
fessor in the infectious diseases
and microbiology department.
Silvestre said the Equal Rights

g up to formation of committee

in the kind of free and open dia- Alliance was poised to launch a ,

fundraising drive among
churches and labor unions to
support the lawsuit against Pitt.
“But last fall, when the rumors
started about possible negotia-
tions, we agreed to slow down a
bit and not rock the boat too
much,” he said.

ACLU lawyers updated
plaintiffs on general progress but
not speciﬁcs of the negotiations.
“We were not clued in on the
negotiations themselves,” said

Mark Friedman. “It was strictly ‘

between the lawyers, which I
think is appropriate. But we had
to sign off on this agreement” to
temporarily suspend the lawsuit
while a committee‘ of faculty,
staff, students, administrators,
trustees and alumni studies the
issue of health beneﬁts for same-
sex partners. ' ,
Several people privy to the

negotiations told the University
Times —— anonymously — that
Pitt General Counsel Alan
Garﬁnkel played a leading role.
Board of Trustees Secretary
Robert Dunkelman (who em-
phasized that he personally did
not participate in the negotia-
tions) said: “The key person in
this whole thing was Alan.”

Garfinkel did not return
phone calls from the University
Times.

ACLU attorney Roslyn
Litman refused to specify how
she, Garﬁnkel and other lawyers
contributed to the breakthrough
that led to creation of the com-
mittee thatwill make recommen-
dations to Chancellor Norden-
berg.

“I don’t think it’s really ap-
propriate to discuss who said
what to Whom at what time,”
Litman said. But she added, “I
think the approach we’re taking
is an intelligent compromise for
everybody.”

named to the newly created job
ofvice president for institutional
relations at La Roche College,
effective July 1.

He will direct La Roche’s
communications, marketing,
public affairs, development, and
government and community re-
lations programs. .

Service, who has served on
the college’s board of trustees
for the last four years, also will
coordinate outreach efforts for
La Roche’s Pacem in Terri: (Peace

gram brings students from war-
torn nations to La Roche to
study, in the hope that they even-
tually will return home and help
bring stability to their countries.

“My ﬁrst year here at Pitt
[1994] was the last year of J.
Dennis O’Connor’s chancellor-
ship,” Service recalled, “and the

-Universitywas having some hard

times at that point with the me-

. dia.” Service said he considers

himself fortunate in having been

_ able to contribute to institutional

progress under O’Connor’s suc-
cessor, Mark Nordenberg.
Service also said he’s proud
of having helped to launch two
University publications, the Pitt

the committee is not too large,”
he commented. “It seems like a
manageable group. ,

“My biggest concern is that
there be a reasonable time frame
for this committee to do its

“Well, Bigelow Boulevard

Pitt’s unsuccessful efforts
during the late 1990s to close
that street between Forbes "and
Fifth avenues “represented one
of the more difﬁcult issues we’ve
had to deal with,” Serw'ce noted.
“But I like to think that the les-

Pharmacy school bucksinational



trend of declining enrollments

pplications to phar-
macy schools nation-
— wide are in a six—year

downward spiral, one factor con-
tributing to concern about a na-

‘ tional shortage of pharmacists.

5 But Pitt’s School of Pharmacy
is bucking that trend, said a

school ofﬁcial, and Pitt is pro— ‘ 

ducing graduates who meet the
growing pati‘ent—care responsi-
bilities of the professional phar-
macist. ' .
According to the American
Association of Colleges of Phar-
macy, applications to the 82 ac-
credited U.S. pharmacy colleges
and schools are down about 30
percent from 1 994. Applications
in the ’90s peaked at 34,2 00, com-

I pared to 24,100 last year, the _ '

most recent ﬁgure available.

“However, in 1999-2000,
while 44 pharmacy schools re-
ported decreases in their appli-
cation pools, 36, including
Pitt, reported increases,” said
Gary Stoehr, Pitt pharmacy as-
sociate dean for student and aca-
demic affairs.

“These data, coupledwith the
increasing numbers of students
taking the Pharmacy School
Admission Test, indicate that the
application pool decline may be
bottoming out.”

Stoehr said Pitt’s increase in
applications‘ is partially due to
the high ranking given the

*5 school. Pitt ranked 7th among

the nation’s schools and colleges

of pharmacy in research funding I

awarded by the National Insti-
tutes of Health, topping more
than $4 million in ﬁscal year
2000. ‘ - ._
He added that fall 2000 en-
rollments were up nationally by
6 percent over fall 1999, and that
the number of pharmacy ﬁrst
professional degrees conferred
rose by a modest 1.7 percent
over the previous year.

In addition to concernabout

-pharmacy school applications, -
increased use of prescription’

.medications,‘increased access to
health care, expanded health in—
surance coverage and a length-
ened pharmacy education pro—

gram are factors causing an in— ‘

creasing demand for more and
better—qualiﬁed pharmacists,
Anxiety over shortages

 

»  _,  Ia“:

‘ prompted a U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services

study of the national pharmacy

' scene in 1999. The congression-

ally mandated study, released in
December 2000, concluded that
the nation faces a serious short-
age of pharmacists, a side effect
ofwhich is the potential for medi-

cal errorsdue to stress and over— I
.work.

There are 196,000 licensed
pharmacists nationwide. The
number is expected to grow by
about 28,500 over the current
decade, 800 fewer than the num-
ber of new licensees in the 19905.
And the demand for pharmacists
continues to climb, the national
study indicated.

The study estimated that

there were 7,000 unﬁlled full-

and part—time pharmacy posi-
tions nationwide as of February
2000. _

“It should be noted there are

also parallel shortages inseveral ~

   

01H.“ ’ ' ‘run  i ‘

other health care ﬁelds, every-
thing from medical/technical
writers to tissue informatics spe-
cialists,” Stoehr said. “This is
not just limited to pharmacy.”
Medical and nursing schools
showed declines in enrollment
in recent years as Well, he noted.

Part of the changing scene in
pharmacy is due to a shift in

’ educational programs that be-
gan in the earlycl990s, when
schools started awarding doctor- _

_ ates as their entry—level degree

insteadof bachelor’s degrees.
In 1996, Pitt replaced its ﬁve-

year bachelor of science" program 0

with a six—year doctor of phar-
macy (Pharm.D.) program. At
that time, about two-thirds of
the 75 schools and colleges of
pharmacy offered the Pharm.D.
doctorate as their entry—level
degree.

Currently, about 3 5 0 students
are enrolled in Pitt’s Pharm.D.
professional program. Students

_ Now in place at UPMC
Shadyside and soon to be used at

UPMC Presbyterian, ROBOT— ,
Rx is programmed to dispense ,

scheduled medicines and ﬁrst

. . doses, as well as inpatient unit

stock medicines.
The system works via a ro-
, botic arm operating on vertical
and horizontal rails that retrieves
medications and deposits them

into patient—speci,ﬁc dispensers.
The system uses bar codes to
verify, retrieve and track unit

dose medications dispensed to ‘

patients. ROBOT-Rx can re-

trieve one medication in under 3 ,

seconds and can ﬁll 700 dose
per hour-_ . — -
“This robotic technology is-
revolutionizing, the pharmacy
profession by enabling pharma-
cists to expedite service to inpa-
tients, thus allowing them to fo-
cus more on direct patient care,”
said Robert]. Weber, executive
director of pharmacy for UPMC
Presbyterian and UPMC
Shadyside hospitals and profes-
sor of pharmacy and therapeu-

tics at Pitt’s School of Pharmacy._ '

“These clinical activities include

consultation with physicians and
nurses on drug therapy and pa-
tient education. Additionally,
this will help contain costs and
maintain inventory control.”
Under Pennsylvania law,
pharmacists, are required to

double-check the robotic’

system ?s dosages for accuracy be-

fore sending them up to patient .

units, but the robotic system
speeds up distribution proce-
dures substantially. A

ROBOT—Rx currently ﬁlls
approximately 2,500 prescrip-
tions per day at UPMC

is reported to have dispensed
more than 45 million doses na-
tionwide without an error. .

must have completed the two-

year, 62 -credit pre-professional
curriculum, typically taken in the
College of Arts and Sciences,
prior to admission to "the four-

‘ year ﬁrst professional program.
‘ Based on current enrollment_

ﬁgures, the school expects to
award 90—plus pharmacy doctor-

ates a year, on average. (The ﬁrst,

class to complete the new pro—
gram, the class of 2000, had 97
graduates.) '
According to Stoehr, there
are two special considerations in
evaluating.Pitt’s application and
enrollment pools. .
“First, it’s difﬁcult to com-

_ pare raw numbers of our appli-
cation pool to other schools of .
3 pharmacy because many admit

freshmen, and we don’t,” Stoehr
said. “Instead, we offer condi-

C tional acceptance to high school
seniors, but intentionally limit‘

the number of students in this
group, selecting only those who
are truly likely to succeed. Other
schools, Duquesne for example,
admit large numbers of fresh-
men then go through a natural
selection process to arrive at the
same point.” ‘I ‘
Second, the number of high
school students applying to Pitt
for conditional‘ acceptance to
pharmacy declined with the 1996

elimination of the bachelor of;

science program, Stoehr said. But

the number_of students applying.

to transfer to the school has more
than offset that decrease in the
last few years. , _ '
“Much of the decline in ap-
plications comes from high

‘school students unwilling to
commit six years to their educa- ‘
7- tion,” Stoehr said. “Pharmacy is

attracting more and more stu-
dents with prior degrees. Con-
sequently, the quality of student

admitted to the Pittprogram, as

measured by QPA and SAT
scores,“ has increased over time.
Our graduates’ performance on

' both parts of thelicensing exam

continues to outpace state and
national perforrnances. Lastyear,

ing the theoretical exam passed

different curriculum from the,

school’s bachelor—degree days.
Starting salaries for Pharm.D.
holders can run in the six-ﬁgure
range, particularly where short-
ages are most acute such as the
Southwest, Texas and parts of
California. “Our students are

‘ recruited for jobs while they’re

still in school,” Stoehr said. A
recent student survey indicated
that 100 percent of respondents
had jobs in the pharmacy ﬁeld,

one of the few positive aspects of V

the nationwide shortage.
Among the Health and Hu-
man Services‘study’s recommen-
dations for addressing the phar-
macist shortage are to increase
the responsibilities of non-
Pharm.D. technicians, to stream-

‘ line health insurance processes

and third—party payment tasks,
to build an Internet system that
allows pharmacies to ﬁll prescrip-
tions and provide health infor-
mation at remote sites and to
develop’ technologies to -aid in
the distribution of pharmaceuti-
cals.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Testing, research among dean’s
priorities in School of Education

ccountability, stan-
dardized tests, out-
comes — to’day_’s

‘educational buzz words — are

all well and good, said the dean
of Pitt’s School of Education.
But they can’t be viewed in the
abstract devoid of social realities

, and evolvinginstructional meth-

ods.
“There is an argument that
highly standardized tests really

' matter when people take them

seriously and teachers use them
to motivate students and the tests
inﬂuence to some degree what
teachers are going to teach —
that’s good stuff. It’s really im-
portant,” said Alan Lesgold. .
“But it’s. also true that in the
modern school environment,
with the line down the hall from
the nurse’s ofﬁce ofkids waiting

A to get one type or other of

psycho-active drug to make it
through the day, a week of major
high-stakes testing that’s going
to make the parents and the
teachers and the kids nervous as
hell may not demonstrate the
world’s best outcome.” ‘.

In addition to re—thinking tra-
ditional educational methods,
Lesgold said in an interview with

‘the University Times last week

that there are three broad initia-
tives he would like to see imple-
mented over the next few years:
building on the strong research
methodology component of the
school; developing a focus on
the use of videotape for teacher
training and educational re-

search, and collaborating with

the Pittsburgh School District
to counteract the expected short-
age of school administrators.

“I think there’s room in the
research methodology world and
the testing methodology world
to ﬁnd ways to spread account-‘
ability measurement over the
course of the school year. Psy-
chologically, it would be a lot
more productive to have a care-
fully selected 10 minutes of test-
ing every week or two and build

. a picture over the year of how —

things are going for the student
and the class and the school,
rather than having one or two
days,” Lesgold said. “The math-
ematics of what needs to be done
—- humanely —— can be built.”
The education dean said that
developing the mathematics for
such a testing strategy, already
within the reach of educational
measurement methodologists, is
an issue that merits serous atten-
tion for schools of education.
“How close are we? We al-
ready make substantial use of
what we call computerized-adap-.
tive testing,” such as the Gradu-
ate Record Examination (GRE).
“The GRE is a sequence of ques-
tions that hones in on your capa-
bilities as efﬁciently as possible.
It does make the assumption that
during the time of ‘the test, your

abilities are not going to change,” ,
‘Lesgold said. —

So if sequential testing is to
be distributed over the course of
a year, measurement must take
into account that test-takers are-
learning during that time pe-
riod, which is not an unsolvable

_ problem, Lesgold said.

6

“Ir seems that high-stakes,
high—standards testing that’s
humane is simply not on the
public agenda right now. We
need more imaginative thinking
— about how we know what’s
going on and if schools are get-
ting better and if our kids are
gettingwhat they deserve — that
is also compatible with the psy-
chological realities of today’s
school world.”

Lesgold also argued for ex-
panding the use of videotape.in
teaching and, especially, teacher

training. He cited the Computer '

and Curriculum Inquiry Center,
a teacher training lab that opened
at the school injanuary, as a ﬁrst
step in achieving that goal. (See
University Timer, ﬁznuary 25.)
“Video allows for the stuff

tant for our teaching function,
but I see it as major formative
force in a new generation of rig-
orous educational research. ‘
“How to do the perfect mul-
tiple choice test may be very dif-
ferent from the mathematics of
how toevaluate a public speak-
ing performance on a videotape.
But there’s room for work in
that area and I hope that across

the appointments we make,

there’s at least one person and
maybe more who can bring a
focus to that.”

The effort would increase stu-
dent teaching effectiveness
through analysis of videotaped
classes and,it would add to the
portfolioof a prospective teacher
looking. for employment,

Lesgold added. .

but they will be facing a shortage

of school leadership, including

administrators, superintendents
and principals. But we are work-

‘ ing to jointly solve that problem.
_ We are committed to ﬁnding a

way to do it.” ' V
The ﬁrst order of business,

according to the dean, is to en-

sure that continuing education

‘work done by those moving to-

ward school administration is co-
ordinated with the School of
Education’s programs and in step
with state requirements to keep
candidates on track. .
Second, Pitt is looking into

‘ scheduling administrator train-

ing courses at Pittsburgh school
sites.

Third, the education school
seeks to establish an agreement
that interns in the MAT pro-
gram can be placed in the class-

. rooms of some of the people
-who want to become school ad-

ministrators, freeing them up a
couple hours a’ day to do their
training elsewhere-

“It seems that high-stakes, ~ .
high-standards testing that’s humane
is simply not on the public agenda

right now. We need more imaginative ,

. thinl<ing...that is also compatible with

the psychological realities of today’s

Symantec Corporation for the
Norton AntiVirus software, ac-
cording to the University’s tech-

nology web site [wvvw.pitt.edu/ .

technology.html].

The University previously
contracted ‘with McAfee‘.com
Corp. The new agreement will
allow the University to continue
to distribute antivirus software
to. members of its community
without charging a fee. 4

Software covered by the li-

censing agreement includes

antivirus software. for Windows
and Macintosh operating sys-
tems, and for Novell NetWare
and Microsoft Windows NT-
based servers.

The Windows version sup-

ports Windows 95, 98, NT and _

2000.

The Macintosh version sup-
ports all current versions of the
Mac OS. (Support for Mac OS X
requires running the software in
a Mac OS 9 partition.)

The I clean acknowledged,
however, that moving in that
direction would require training
and hiring more staff.”

Lesgold said a third priority
is to partner with the Pittsburgh
School District to combat the

‘ expected shortage, here and

across the nation, of school ad-
ministrators. '

A “Pittsburgh schools probably
won’t have a teacher shortage,

you to ensure that you can have

people become -school leaders?”

Although Lesgold predicted
that Pitt and the school district
would reach some agreement this
fall, he acknowledged that there
were still issues to be resolved. -

“It involves some faculty de-
cisions and some district issues.
It won’t be easy,_because faculty
have an obligation to make sure

that what carries credit is ac—.
complishing the goals set by our,

courses and programs here, and

the district wants to make it as 4

easy as possible for good people
to get this kind of training with-

out sacriﬁcingits own standards.” A

Lesgold added that a success-
ful partnership. could become a
model for how a strong educa-
tion school and a school district
can work together to further the
goals of both. I .

The dean said that other item
on his agenda are fostering stron-
ger- collaborations with other Pitt
schools; developing more cen-
tralized control and monitoring
of the enrollment processes
across the school’s 13 units, for
which a consulting ﬁrm has been
hired to make recommendations;

. consolidating recruitment prac-

tices; forming stronger ties with
alumni, and bringing in highly
qualiﬁed and motivated younger
faculty.

3 regional campuses  

ncreases in student activity
I fees at the Bradford,
Greensburg and Titusville
campuses were ‘approved by the
Pitt Board of Trustees’ student
affairs committee on May 29. ‘
The increases would take ef-
fect infall 2001. They require
approval by the full board, which
is expected to vote on the hikes
at its June 2 8 meeting.
At UPB, the student activity

fee would rise from $60 to $75 —

per term" for each full—time stu-
dent. The increase would meet
ﬁnancial needs of student clubs
and organizations and cover
higher costs of student activities

programs brought to the’

Bradford campus, according to
the campus’s administration and
the executive committee of
UPB’s advisory board, which

» approved the fee hike at the rec-

ommendation of the Bradford
campus student government as-
SOClaUOl1. _ -

The fee was last increased in
1997. _ B

The Greensburg campus stu-
dent activity fee would rise from
$40 to $5 3 per term for each full-
time student and from $14 to

$18 for each part-time student.‘

The increase was recommended
by the UPG student government

association and endorsediby the-

campus’s advisory board to fund
rising costs and growing partici-
pation in organizational activi-
ties.

UPG’s fee was last increased
in 2000 by $5 per term for each
full-time student and $2 per term
for each part-time student.

The Titusville campus’s_ stu-
dent activities fee would increase
by $25 to $75 per term for each
full-time student, to keep up with
rising costs and to expand ser-
vices provided to students. A

major portion of the increase.

would fund expansion of trans-
portation services available to

‘UPT students.

‘_‘It is extremely important to
provide these transportation ser-
vices because of the relative iso-
lation of the Titusville campus
and because no public transpor-
tation exists in Titusville,” ac-
cording to a background state-
ment to the resolution approved
by the trustees’ student affairs
committee. I

The hike was endorsed by
the Titusville campus advisory
board’s executive committee, at

the recommendation of the UPT -

student affairs committee‘.
Titusville’s student activity fee
was last increased by $10 per
term in 1990.

I\IASA grant
awarded

NASA’s Mars Global Sur-
veyor Data Analysis Program has
awarded a $207,000 grant to
David A. Crown, an adjunct
assistant professor in Pitt’s De-
partment of Geology and Plan-
etary Science and a research sci-
entist at the Planetary Science
Institute in Tucson, Ariz.

The objective of this new
NASA program is to enhance
scientiﬁc return from data ac-

quired byMars Global Surveyor, A

an orbiting spacecraft that is re-
turning high—resolution images
of the Mars surface and obtain-
ing detailed measurements of
Martian topography.

Crown’s investigation, a
three—year study entitled “High—
land Degradation in the Hellas

' Region of Mars,” was one of 47

selected for funding. Crown’s
research will include analyses of
surface environments in, and the

I _ geologic history of, an ancient

highland region of Mars as well

“Community

centered work
stabilization
programs help
homeless with
substance
abuse

A community—supported
work stabilization program pro-
motes sustained decreases in sub-
stance use, criminal behavior and
health care uﬁlization among
homeless people in Pittsburgh,
according to a presentation at
the May 5 Society of General
Internal Medicine Meeting by
Pitt physician Adam Gordon.

The project evaluated a com-
munity—based work stabilization
program that integrated health
care providers, managed care

providers, social service agen-

cies, members of the private sec-
tor and charitable organizations
to treat homeless people with
substance abuse problems.

“The people we studied were
a very vulnerable population.
What we were looking for, and
may have found, is the best
method to help them,” said Gor-
don, of the School ofMedicine’s
internal medicine department.
He also is a member of the Cen-
ter for Research on Health Care
and VA Pittsburgh Center for
Health Services Research.

Past studiesin Pittsburgh in-
dicate that 63{ percent of home-
less people have received health
care in the previous six months,
indicating that they are using
health care services. Yet the age-

p mortality rate nationwide for the

homeless is 3.7 times that of the
general population. This indi-
cated that there was something
missing from the care they were

a receiving, according to Gordon.
“This population may need a _

comprehensive approach to
health and social care, encom-
passing not only detoxiﬁcation
and other health services but
long—term rehabilitation and

continued support from their _

communities,” he said.

' One hundred twenty partici-
pants of the Salvation Army’s
Public Inebriate Program were

enrolled in the work stabiliza- ’

tion program. Participants re-
ceived temporary, skill-building
employment at Goodwill for
three months as well as monitor-
ing of their abuse problem. The
program also provided them with
a checking account, housing as-
sistance, free medical care and
vocational training.

Almost half of the partici-
pants completed the program.
Of these, 95 percent found em-
ployment. VVhile participating
in the work component, 84 per-
cent were arrest—free, 87 percent
attended medical appointments,

-69 percent reported career skill .

improvement, 47 percent im-
proved their housing status and

. 40 percent abstained from drugs
and alcohol.

Six months - after completing
the program 33 percent main-
tained full-time employment,-3 9
percent further improved their
housing situation and 36 per-
cent remained abstinent of sub-
stance abuse. Over 90 percent

‘ reported that their medical and

psychiatric needs were met.

Paclitaxel plus
carboplatin

safe, effective

in patients
with advanced
lung cancer

New data show that patients
with advanced lung cancer may
have a safer chemotherapy treat-
ment option.

The use of paclitaxel plus
carboplatin, administered in a
novel weekly regimen, offers a

-safe and effective treatment op-

tion for patients with advanced
lung cancer, according to re-

search presented recently at the
37th annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical
Oncology. Safety and tolerabil-
ity are of critical importance in
patients with advanced lung can-
cer.

“These data show that the
use of weekly paclitaxel plus
carboplatin provides a tolerable
treatment for patients with ad-
vanced lung cancer,” said
Chandra Belani, lead investi-
gator of the study from Pitt’s
School ofMedicine and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Cancer In-
stitute.

The study enrolled patients
with untreated advanced non-
small cell lung cancer. It was
designed to evaluate three dif-
ferent regimens of weekly
paclitaxel plus carboplatin.

An estimated 169,500 new
cases of lung cancer will be diag-
nosed in 2001, accounting for 13
percent of cancer diagnoses, ac-
cording to the American Cancer
Society. Non-small cell lung can-
cer accounts for 80 to 85 percent
of all lung cancer cases.

Lung cancer will claim ‘the
lives of more than 157,000 men
and women this year, account-
ing for 28 percent of all cancer
deaths. Since 1987, more women
have died each year from lung
cancer than breast cancer, which,
for over 40 years, was the major
cause of cancer death in women.
It is estimated that 67,300 women
will die from lung cancer and
40,200 women will die from
breast cancer in 2001.

Geriatrics wins
clinical
research award
Pitt’s division of geriatric
medicine has won the clinical
research award from the inter-
national Society for Urody—
namics and Female Urology
(SUFU), one of the world’s lead-
ing societies in the ﬁeld of void-

ing dysfunction and inconti-

nence. The award was presented
for a study of urinary ‘inconti-
nence in those over the age of 60.

SUFU is the largest Ameri-

can society dealing with dysfunc-

tion of the lower urinary tract,
including‘, urinary incontinence,
prostatism, cystoceles/rectoceles
and urinary retention.

Pitt’s geriatric medicine divi-
sion recently was named a na-

tional Center for Geriatric Ex-

cellence by the Hartford Foun-
dation. -

Cholesterol, .
blood pressure
goals for type]
diabetics
proposed

Researchers at Pitt’s Gradu-
ate School of Public Health have
proposed the first—ever blood
pressure and cholesterol goals
forpeople with type 1 diabetes, a
group that is at high ‘risk for
coronary artery disease and pre-
mature death.

Research ﬁndings will be pub-
lished in thejune issue of Diabe-
tes Care, a journal of the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association.

“For reasons that are unclear,
people with type 1 diabetes have
more than double the risk of
cardiovascular disease than do

' those without diabetes, but no

guidelines exist to help set goals
for two of the most important
risk factors for the complications
for this disease — lipids and blood
pressure,” said senior investiga-
tor Trevor Orchard, professor

of epidemiology, medicine and A

pediatrics.
' Orchard’s study, funded by

the National Institutes of Health, .A

indicates that people with type 1
diabetes should vigorously con-
trol these two risk factors, aim-
ing for goals as strict or stricter
than those currently in place for
people with cardiovascular dis-
ease.

Investigators set the goals

. based on their analysis of data

from the Pittsburgh Epidemiol-

ogy of Diabetes Complications
(EDC) Study, a 10-year prospec-

, tivestudy of 589 adults with

childhood-onset type 1 diabe-

tes. Study subjects had been dia— /

betic for an average of 20 years.
Based on their analyses, Or-

chard and his colleagues suggest ’

the following levels for men and
women ages 18-55 with type 1
diabetes: LDL cholesterol,‘ less
than 100 mg/dl; HDL choles-

. terol, more than 45 mg/dl; trig-

lycerides, less than 150 mg/dl;
blood pressure, less than 120/
80.

Guidelines set by the Ameri—- _

can Diabetes Association and the
National Cholesterol Education

Program generally apply to type j V

2 diabetes, according to Orchard.

“Goal-setting for patients
with type 1 diabetes is more com-
plex because of the higher oc-
currence of microvascular com-
plications that we have shown to
be related to blood lipids and
blood pressure levels as well,”
Orchard said. “Additional com-
plications are caused by the rela-
tionship between renal disease
and coronary artery disease in
people with type 1.”

Also, because people with
type 1 often have had diabetes
and the accompanying risk fac-
tors since childhood, resulting
diseases are more likely to mani-
fest themselves over time in these
patients than in people with type
2, who normally develop diabe-
tes in adulthood. .

During thestudy, 67 subjects
died, 105 developed coronary
artery disease, 92 developed

.lower—extremity arterial disease,

52 developed overt nephropa-
thy, 120 developed distal sym-
metrical polyneuropathy, and
148 developed proliferative ret-
inopathy. Adjustments for age/
gender were generally minor.

NASA device used for remote volcano monitoring

The ﬁrst images generated
by NASA’s Advanced Space-
borne Thermal Emission and
Reﬂection‘Radiometer (ASTER)
show that the instrument is an
ideal tool for remote volcanic
mbnitoring, according to Pitt re-
searcher Nlichael Ramsey.

Ramsey, "director of Pitt’s
Image Visualization and Infra-
red Spectroscopy laboratory and '
an associate professor of geol-
ogy and planetary science, is part
of a team of scientists that pre-
sented the ﬁrst results May 29 at ~
the American Geophysical
Union meeting in Boston.

ASTER is an imaging instru-

ment aboard Terra, a satellite .‘

launched in 1999 as part of
NASA’s Earth Observing Sys-
tem. The instrument combines
three imaging technologies —
visible/. near infrared, short—wave
infrared and thermal infrared —
to obtain detailed maps of land
surface temperature, emissions,
reﬂective qualities and elevation.
Using ASTER . images,
Ramsey studied volcanic activity
in the Soufriére Hills Volcano
on the Caribbean Island of
Montserrat, and the Bezymianny
Volcano on the Kamchatka Pen-
insula in Russia during the past

‘nine months.

“The high spatial and spec-
tral resolution of ASTER,

coupled with the excellent ra-
diometric accuracy, makes AS-
TER an ideal tool for detecting
temperature changes and volca-
nic monitoring,” Ramsey said.

— ASTER takes “snapshots” of
the Earth about every ﬁvedays.

“Because ASTER doesn’t

have fast repeat times, we aren’t
in a position to watch eruptions
begin and progress,” said

Ramsey. “But we can observe

changes on the week timescale.
This is very important after the
initial eruption and the forma-
tion of a lava dome. These act
like corks in many ways and
subtle changes reveal informa-
tionabout potential eruptions. ”I
