VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 99

Elementary 
Watson, discoverer of DNA  
double helix, speaks at Pitt   -

MARTY FLAHERTY
Staff Writer

James Watson, co-discoverer of

A thedoubleihelix structure of DNA and

co-recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize
for medicine and physiology, demon-
strated in his lecture last night that his

-dry wit is as well developed as his

scientific mind.

His groundbreaking research with
partner Francis Crick offered insight
into the makeup of. DNA and its
process of replication, and is'consid-
ered by many to be the most impor-
tant biochemical discovery of the
20th century.

Watson commented on current

issues in genetics, saying that “genet-

ic fingerprints,” or records of an indi-
vidual that can be used to identify
him or her, should be taken from
everyone at birth in order to help
combat crime.

But he offered the caveat that “if
you can catch crooks easier,Vyou also
need to be more forgiving.” His rea-

son: “I think everyone in this room

has some criminal tendencies. I know

I have.” _ .

He also said that genetic disease
resulted from the fact that “evolution
wants to create new things.”

Watson shared "dozens of anec-

dotes chronicling his life from his
childhood experience as a contestant
on the popular radio program “Quiz
Kids,” through his work to identify
the makeup of the human genome.

He recalled his’ role on “Quiz,

Kids” as being one of the older_ kids
whose eventual — and ostensibly
contrived — fate was to lose to chil-
dren younger than them, recalling
that, at the age of 13, he lostpto a
seven-year-old girl.

His demise, he explained, came

-when “they asked questions on the

Old Testament, ‘which I had never
read as an Irish Catholic.”

Two years later, at‘the age of 15,
he entered the University of Chicago
to study zoology, having completed
only two years of high school. He
said ‘that his early admittance was

allowed by policy based upon the

assumption that “the American high
school was beyond redemption.”

WES BRYANT/PHOTO EDITOR

Famed biologist James Watson, who along with his partner Francis Crick, iden-
tiﬁed the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, spoke at Pitt last night.

Watson attended graduate school
at Indiana University, earning a doc-
torate in zoology at the age of 22,
then traveled to Copenhagen, and
later Cambridge. He said, at the time,

people “still thought Europe was the.“

intellectual equal of the U.S.”

At Cambridge, he met Crick, and
between the fall of 1951- and April of
1953, the two developed the double
helix model of DNA. Watson was just

25 when their results were published. ‘

From 1989 through 1992, after

years of teaching, at Harvard
University and the California Institute
of Technology, ,Watson directed the
efforts of the National Center for
Human Genome Research, helping to
lead international efforts to map out
the entire human genetic code.

He was awarded the Presidential.

Medal of Freedom and the National
Medal of Science in 1977, and is cur-
rently the president of the Carnegie
Institute’s molecular biology lab at
Cold Spring Harbor, N .Y.

WPIC doctor dispels the myths of mental hospitals

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
Staff Writer

Straitjackets, padded rooms’ and.

electroconvulsive therapy often come
to mind when students think about
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, - likely inﬂuenced by movies
such as “Girl, Interrupted” and “One
Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”

But according to administrators in
Oak1and’s mental hospital, Western
Psych is simply a UPMC hospital and
behavioral health service provider.
Most of the services offered there
don’t even involve hospital stays.

Dr. Jack Cahalane, clinical admin-
istrator and director of the Belleﬁeld
Clinic, said that many people still con-
sider having a psychiatric disorder
equivocable to having a personality
flaw. He said that this view prevents
people from seeking medical attention.

Cahalane said that society’s nega-
tive imagelof psychiatric hospitals
deter people from pursuing therapy by
making them think that they will be
told they are crazy and will be put in a
psychiatric hospital.

In fact, Cahalane said, most people
have never even seen a mental hospi-
tal.

Hospital

treatment, otherwise

known as inpatient treatment, is not
very common. It is reserved primarily
for people who either cannot take care
of themselves or who are dangerously
suicidal. Most patients aren’t hospital-
ized for a very long
time.

According to
Cahalane, an average
inpatient’s stay lasts
one week. The main

goal during their stay After Va, condition is
is to stabilize them so become determined, the type of
they can return to and treatment that would,
function more effi- comfortable be most appropriate is

ciently in their homes.

“It doesn’t help
someone to take them
out of their environ-
ment for months,”
Cahalane said.

For Pitt students,
Western Psych is a
place that offers treat- 3
ment and support. Students can call the
clinic when they are feeling extremely
stressed or are depressed, two condi-
tions which have become common
among college students.

Students can also call Western
Psych" and talk to a therapist on the
phone. The therapist will answer ques-
tions and dispel any fears or concerns

decides to seek counseling or feels he
or she might need treatment, the stu-

said ' many people
come to Western Psych
feeling depressed, but
don’t want to take any
medication. ’

In place of drug treat-
ments,’ therapy ses-
sions over a short peri-

god of time can be an effective altema-

tive treatment. _
“Psychotherapy over an eight to 12
week period is as good as medication.
We tend to see people for short periods
of time,”" Cahalane said. , ’_
Western Psych’s mission is to help
people move beyond difﬁcult periods
so that they can get on with their lives.

Even (the, inpatient ‘services are

decreased 95 percent in recent years.
Seclusion is only used when the

and the time they spend alone is usual-
ly verybrief; usually between 15 and
30 minutes.
Western Psychiatric wants to make
people more aware of their rrrental

Pitt group says it’s glad NY
protests didn’t turn violent

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

Anyone who saw television news
coverage of the protesters outside of
the World Economic Forum summit in
New York City last weekend may have
been watching Pitt students.

Fourteen members of Pitt’s
Students in Solidarity traveled to New
York to be a part of the protests against
globalization and other economi
issues. '

Josh Weinberg, a member of SIS,
was instrumental in organizing the trip
with the Thomas Merton Center and the
Black Radical Congress.

“It was a really interesting experi-
ence seeing the mass demonstrations,”
Weinberg said.

According to Weinberg, the ‘trip

went well, largely due to the lack of ‘

violence and rioting that occurred at
similar protests such as those against
the Seattle World" Trade Organization
conference in 1999. Such violence and
the concern about possible terrorism
was responsible for the New York secu-
rity, which “-was tighter than at other
conventions

“There was a hell of a lot of cops,”
Weinberg said. .

The main event of the protest was a
march that boasted more than 7,000
participants.

“[The march] was actually pretty
scary at points,” Weinberg said,
“because we got boxed in by cops and

they all had riot gear and everything,

And every 10 feet orso was an under-
cover cop with the same mustache.”

Weinberg said that the protest.

events were extremely varied in their
subject matter, but that they all focused
on similar ideas and used similar slo-

gans, such as “Money for food, not

war.”

“Inequality is caused by globaliza-
tion and money going to military
instead of social programs,” Weinberg
said.

One _often-repeated statistic was _

that 225 people, “most of whom were
probably there,”
Weinberg, own 47 percent of the
world’s wealth. '

“We don’t know if we have the
answer,” Weinberg said, “but the World
Economic Forum is part of the prob-

. lem.

State law should require insurers
to cover contraceptives

It’s been a long time since the access
to birth control was a legal or controver-
sial issue. The Supreme Court resolved
the issue in 1965, ruling that the right to
privacy provided a right to birth control.

Still, problems with actual access to
birth control remain. Only 18 states have
passed laws requiring health insurers to
cover birth control.

With a new compromise put on the
table, it looks like New York is about to
become number 19.

And it’s about time. The statistics
about contraceptive needs are startling.
Birth control is a health care need affect-
ing both men and women, and it is past
time states and the federal government
start treating the issue as such.

According to the Plarmed Parenthood
Web site (www.plarmedparenthood.com),
60 million women in the United States
are of childbearing age. Of that number,
42 million are sexually active and do not
wish to become pregnant. The result is a
large, urmecessary gender gap in out-of-
pocket health care expenses.

The reality is that covering birth con-

trol options is inexpensive and highly.

cost efﬁcient. Providing full contracep-
tive coverage in an employment-based
heath care plan would only cost employ-
ers approximately $21.40 per employee

per year, according to Planned
Parenthood. Many employers probably
spend more providing coffeeto employ-
ees. Then compare the number to the cost
of replacing female employees who quit
as a result of pregnancies — $14,000 per
employee.

It’s clearly time that Pennsylvania
and the federal government did some-
thing. Planned Parenthood lists
Pennsylvania as having a contraceptive
equity bill pending. Send the message to
Harrisburg: get the bill off the shelf and
on to the books. A similar bill has been
introduced intoCongress multiple times
since 1997 with no result.

While it is largely considered a
women’s issue, birth control is a men’s
issue as well. Not only should men con-
sider themselves responsible parties
when it comes to sex, but they should also
be concerned about larger societal issues
relevant to the availability of birth control
and resulting unwanted pregnancies.

Just because birth control is made
accessible and easily available does not
mean that women and couples are forced
to use it. Those who choose to use any
form of prescription contraceptive should
ﬁnd it available and covered by insurance
agencies. It’s past time the Congress and
the states made this a reality.

reﬂected in SGB choice

Last Monday, the.,members of the
Student Government Board Voted to
remove Carrie Howard, one of «
the board’s two black mem-
bers, from her position on the
nine-member panel. Almost
immediately, former board
member Rob Brown was con-
cerned about -what the board
was planning on doing to
ensure that the board would
still proportionately represent
students on campus.

My question is simple and ,

present members, non-Greeks are a minor-
ity on this board. .
The vacancy left behind
by Howard is now open to be
ﬁlled by any undergraduate.
As a result of pressure from
student organizations, it
appears as if the board has
already started ‘excluding cer-
tain portions of the application
P001‘. -  

Let itbe known that I am
a staunch defender of the
rights of . all minorities,

straightforward: Does SGB, as
it is. composed, accurately represent the
diverse student body of this campus?

A quick look at the composition of the
remaining members of the SGB will show
that even though racial minorities may be
an underrepresented sector of this campus
— even more so with the removal of
Howard —— many other individuals and
groups of individuals are not proportionate-
ly represented on the present SGB.

Let me begin with some obvious
observations. To start, six of the eight-SGB
members are in either a fraternity or sorori-
ty. Michelle Agostini and Keniane Ludwig
are the lone exceptions. The last /time ‘I
checked, only approximately 15 percent of
the students overall on this campus are
members of Greek organizations. But the
present SGB has a 75 percent Greek repre-
sentation. .

I am not implying that Greeks on cam-
pus are ' beneﬁting from this present
arrangement, but if the board is looking to
place a member on the panel who is repre-
sentative of this campus, a wise selection
would be a non-Greek. Compared to the

_ whether it is a sexual, racial or
gender‘ minority. But many students on

_ campus are asking themselves whether or

not the SGB already made up its mind con-

- cerning who will ﬁll this position.

What is the point of even having the
entire application process if “some individu-

als have no chance of winning from the .

start? . V

Undoubtedly, many students on cam-
pus would object if, before the election, sev-
eral seats were guaranteed to‘ racial, sexual
and ethnic minority without public electoral
support. Though not explicitly stated by any

‘member of the board, it appears that,

regardless of the applicants, the position
will be granted to a minority.

The removal or resignation of a SGB
member is familiar territory for this
University. Though the present events differ
than those of two boards ago, it appears that

the present board will follow in the foot- _
‘steps of the 2000 SGB —— someone who did

not run last year will be chosen for this cur-
rent vacancy.

A while ago, looking online for the latest

strange headline: A fossilized crocodile the

It wasn’t the news for which I was looking
and I almost ignored it But it was so extreme-

have to confess to a predilection for this kind of

extinct odors that passed through that nose?
Could I ever hearthe terrible noises that this
monster made? Could I ever know why it made

I found myself questioning the value of

As I read the details from Dr. Paul
Sereno’s Oct 25 article “Science Express,” the creature and
its world unfolded before me. It was a hot dawn 80 million
years ago, in an area now part of the Sahara But then it was
a lush tropical forest. Through here ran an ancient river as
wide across as a football ﬁeld. A pair of eyes in the muddy
water was all that was visible of the beast, an 18,000-pound
monster called Sarcosuchus irnperator, 5 feet in diameter,
lying in ambush for dinosaurs.

anything very far from my immediate circle.

And as I continue my Zen—quest to decentralize my out-

News is discovered Like the tree falling in the «forest,

rocking our own world just a little, in reminding us that
humanity is not all there is to reality and that there is much
beyond what goes on in our usual lives and headlines.

Dogg are artists in a rap genre
that has become synonymous
with black culture, so it causes me to won-
der why are white kids listening to them.

Maybe they have come to be color-
blind to music and have learned to appre-
ciate the funky beats of the three artists. Or
maybe they just like the T and A videos. I
certainly hope it’s the ﬁrst reason —- what
listening to music is supposed to be about.

Music is music. So why does it have
to be grouped as “white” and “black”?

When driving, I change radio stations
excessively, switching from rap to rock to
oldies. One day, as I forced my mother to
listen to Creed’s “My Sacriﬁce,” she mur-
mured, “Why do you have to listen to this
white music?”

I tried not to slam my car into a tele-
phone pole in rage. This is a woman who
will empathetically discuss to this day
how much she loved the Beatles, how
Paul was herpfavorite and how she collect-
ed their trading cards. Correct me if I’m
wrong, but haven’t the Beatles always

upon those boundaries when
we hate something? .

Physical segregation ended in the
‘60s, but our minds are still segregated.
The square peg has to listen to the square
music and the circular peg has to listen to
the circular music.

One might say that classifying music
as “black? and “white” helpskeep culture
alive. But what about the few that sneak

across the lines, like Eminem and Bubba ‘

Sparxxx? I’ve never seen Eminem out
selling a bean pie for “the cause of the
brotha man,” but yet he is successful in the
rap industry. Maybe it’s a sign that, like
the world, music can’t be separated com-
pletely into categories.

A recent game of Trivial Pursuit
proved the point when two questions
asked about the ﬁrst black artist in country
music and a black country Hall of Famer.
Black people in country music! Now if
that doesn’t say music is colorblind, I
don’t know what does. But it still seems to
go tmnoticed in today's society.

In the .‘40s, ‘50s and “60s, minorities
seemed open about confessing their enjoy-
ment of Elvis, the Beatles and Bobby
Darrin, but times have changed. Good
luck trying to catch the Black Action
Society playing Linkin Park, Dave
Matthews Band or the Goo Goo Dolls.

‘ I’m not afraid to admit how every
time I hear “Good Riddance (Time of
Your Life)” by Green Day, I cry. I admit to
owning all three Pure Moods CDs. And I
like songs by all three of the bands I just
mentioned.

But maybe that’s just my white side
talking. >

It’s been rare for me to run into a
black person’ who will admit to being a fan
of so-called white music. The closest I ,
have seen has been. ‘N Sync, whom BET
and some “black” radio stations have start-
ed playing.

The fact that they. don’t know or”

won’t admit to knowing about “white
music” is not a problem. An issue only
arises when they refuse to learn or to be
open—minded — this is how prejudice and
racial tension begin. One culture does not
listen to the other, throwing away a change
to understand each other -on a "different
plane. , ,

Maybe one day, everyone will accept
music for music and disband from color-

‘coding it. Until then, I’ll enjoy partying in

South Oakland, playing DMX one hour
and Madonna the next. It’s a mixed girl’s
paradise, but I refuse to swerve.

SGB: Doomed to
repeat history?

McCullough, Page 6

In 2000, it seemed appropriate for the
next-highest vote getter (who did not win a
spot on the board) to replace an outgoing
member, yet that did not happen.

Two years later, it seems we are
doomed to repeat history.

Howard’s recent removal from the
board is just another setback for this year’s_
SGB. This year proved extremelydiﬂicult
for the members of the board due to admin-
istrative delays in the selection of commit-
tee chairs as well as the underage drinking
citations issued to John Algie and Lonny
Fish, despite the fact that both were cleared
later. ' i ’

My problem is not with who is given
the position. In’ all honesty, I do not have
"any preferences, and in the end, I really do
not care who is chosen. My main concern
is that the board seems more concerned
with political correctness than qualiﬁca-
tions when attempting to ﬁll this vacancy.

In the end, no matter who is selected
for the position, controversy will inevitably
follow.

Whoever is selected for the post, minority

or not, should be representative of the stu-
dent body and, unlike Howard, show up to
meetings.

Columnist Mark McCullough wishes all

applicants for this position best of luck and '

hopes that the _new addition will help the
productivity of the board. All comments can
be directed to him at mjmst121 @pitt.edu

Virginia stiﬂes swimming team

Staff Writer

The men’s and women’s swimming
and diving teams hit the road and ﬁn-

’ ished up their regular dual meet season

against the Virginia Tech Hokies and
University of Virginia Cavaliers.

Both squads were dropped by the
No. 12-ranked Cavaliers, while the

men’s team pulled out a successful.

meet against the Hokies.

Men: Pitt 179, Virginia Tech 64 ‘
Women: Pitt 85, Virginia Tech 143
The Pitt men dominated the V-
Tech swimmers and divers, only allow-
ing them to win one event.
The Panthers began the meet with
a ‘win in the 200-yard medley relay,
comprised of Steve Siler, Raymond
Brush, Max Von Bodungen and Mike
Grube. _ »
Three pool records fell at Virginia
Tech’s,War Memorial Pool because of

the Panthers’ excellence. Last year’s .

“Big . East Outstanding Male
Swimmer,” Mike Grube, took the 100-
yard freestyle in a time of 45.50 and his

teammate Siler swam a time of 50.51
in the 100-yard backstoke.

Sophomore Eric Limkemann also
broke a record and took first in the
1000-yard freestyle with a time of
9:26.01.

The Pitt divers took first through -

third places in the 1-meter diving com-
petition, led by Blair Beal. Michael
Wells placed first in the 3—meter com-
petition. _

The women’s team fell to the
Hokies ‘winning. They won just one
relay and ‘three individual events.
Junior Emily Colley had a remarkable
swim in the 1000 freestyle, breaking

“the pool record with a time‘ of

10:12.79. This was Colley’s best regu-
lar-season time. =~

The two Pitt divers dominated their
competition placing first and second in
both events. Jen O’Brien_took ﬁrst in
the 1—meter competition while her
teammate Moreen O’Brien won the 3-
meter competition.

Pitt also had strong swims from
senior Karen Thibodeau, who was

‘barely edged out of first place in the

200-yard backstroke and Kristina

DeWitt, who was only eight tenths of a
second behind the first place ﬁnisher in
the 200-yard breastroke.

Women’s head coach Marian
Cassidy-Keen knew that the meet
would be very tough because Virginia
Tech women’s team is such a strong
competitor. “We were- really happy
with Emily Colley’s swim and overall
the team held up well against the com-
petition,” Gassidy-Keen said.

Men: Pitt 104, Virginia 138
Women: Pitt 103, Virginia 135

The Pitt men’s team experienced
their first defeat of the year against the
N 0. 12- ranked Cavaliers. Although the
team had a number of great swims,
Coach Chuck Knoles thought the team

was a little unprepared for the meet.

“I think our guys were somewhat
intimidated going to UVA and swim-
ming against a team that were their
first real competition of the season,”
Knoles said.

Harguth makes impact in first Season

fiﬁ

JASON YANDER
The Pitt News

Haley Harguth has more in common

with Nike than just Beaverton, Ore. She
- also has the swoosh to match.

The sharp—shooting guard who hails
from the Portland suburb, which is coinci-
dentally the home of sneaker giant Nike, is
making her presence felt in -her ﬁrst season
at Pitt. H .

Harguth not only leads the Panthers in
three-pointers, but also tops the Big Eastin

the same category. Harguth is sixth in the.

conference with a shooting percentage of
.379 from behind the arc. S

“Haley gives us a new aspect with her
shot,” junior teammate Laine Selwyn said.
“Haley is an unreal shooter. It’s a lot easier
to get the ball inside with her on the ﬂoor.
She’s, the key to opening things up for me.”

Harguth isn’t as impressed with her-
self. In fact, according to both coach Traci
Waites and Selwyn, Harguth is downright
hard on herself.

“I don’t think that percentage is that
good,” Harguth said. “I definitely can
improve my game. I’m more of a well-
rounded player than what I’ve shown and
that’s been a little frustratingx I’m more

than just_a shooter.”

lll—timed injuries to‘ Pitt starters have
forced Harguth and other freshmen into
more playing time this season.

In addition, these injuries have driven
Harguth to pick up the scoring slack.
Harguth is fourth in team "scoring, averag-
ing 9.6 points per game, including three
20-point games.

“I am so impressed with her,” Waites
said. “She’s a great kid. She has a good atti-
tude, but she’s really hard on herself. She
needs to deal with the fact that it’s okay to
make mistakes.

“At thislevel, you need kids ,who are

ready to play and Haley has come in and -

helped us.’ She’s helped us all year long,
especially with her scoring. I am very

‘ happy she’s a part of this program,” Waites

added.
The transition from high school to col-
lege is hard enough for most college stu-

‘ dents,»but add athletics" to the mix and the

change can be an intimidating one.

Not only is the college game a differ-
ent one than in high school, but Harguth is
2,575 miles ﬁom her home in Oregon, a
place very different than Pemisylvania.

Corruption and the Olympics

  Harguth a serious threat

from behind the arc

Harguth, page 9

“It’s been tough being away from
home,” Harguth said. “I probably talk to
my parents almost every day. I miss my
dogs a lot too.”

Talking about her three dogs is bound
to put a big smile on Harguth’s face. The
freshman has a Jack Russell terrier named
Reggie and two Briards, a French herding
breed, named Bogie and Desi.

“My dad puts me on speaker phone
with them,” Harguth said. “I’m pretty sure
they recognize my voice. My dad says
they turn their heads when they hear my
voice.”

In addition to Waites’ coaching style,
the Panthers’ potential to win lured
Harguth to the Oakland campus.

After a trip abroad last summer, cam-
pus buildings such as the Cathedral of
Learning and -its Nationality Rooms and
Heinz Chapel remind Harguth of Europe.

“I like the history behind the Cathedral
of I_.earning and Heinz Chapel,” Harguth
said. “All of the buildings on campus have
their own history. Pitt has been around
since the 1700s and I like that.”

Harguth’s inaugural season has not‘
been without frustrations. The team is
mired in a six-garne losing streak and has
won just six games, including only one Big
‘East victory. A

Close losses do not lessen the blow,
but Harguth keeps a good attitude about
the situation and looks at the big picture
involved.

“Coach Waites was a big reason I
came to Pitt,” Harguth said. “I’m still
adjusting to her coaching style, but I agree
with what she wants. It’s been a tough sea- A
son, but I keep the big picture in mind.”

Harguth and her teammates have not
allowed key injuries to get them down. In
fact, Harguth and the Panthers used this
season as a learning experience and hope
to cash in on their newfound wisdom.

“I know we’re good,”, Harguth said.
“We’ re hoping to improve year in and year
out and after seeing how we’ve played
against tough competition this year, we can
play with just about anybody.

“Sure, we’ve had some injuries, but
we’re practicing better and we’re getting
back to early-season form. It might be frus-
trating, but we’re only getting better.”

Wein, page 9

something extraordinary about that.

Average people have been all but elim-
inated from competition in all of the events
that anyone cares about

The use of professional athletes also
gives certain countries unfair advantages
when it comes to certain sports. Take bas-
ketball '

America can have Tim Duncan, Kevin
Garnet and Vince Carter. Croatia can have
Toni Kukoc. Something about that just
doesn’t seem right.

My ﬁnal Olympic gripe deals with
nationalism.

Nationalism used to mean being proud
of the country one represented. It seems to
me that the modern Olympians, speciﬁcally
Americans, have taken this idea to its logi-
cal extreme, or what I like to call, “obnox-
ious nationalism.” . »

“Obnoxious nationalism,” includes but
is not limited to: the cocky and obnoxious
actions exhibited by American track runners
in the 2000 summer games in Sydney,
Australia; the show-oif antics of Vince
Carter and the men’s basketball team (also
in Sydney) and the vandalism‘ and destruc-
tion of hotel rooms by the American hockey
team at Nagano, Japan in 1998.

This‘ is simply poor sportsmanship and

Tuesday, February 5, 2002 '

it seems to have only emerged once profes-
sioﬁal athletes were allowed into competi-
tion. A

If any one factor is responsible for the
success of the modern Olympics, it is the
public’s association of the games with puri-

tY- .
The world likes to take a break from its
political, social and economic problems to

enjoy competition of a healthier variety. ‘

Nations have stopped entire wars for the
sole purpose of taking time to enjoy the
Olympics. . ‘

People desperately want to be able to
ﬁnd enjoyment in something so pure and
simple and there is something fantastically
pure about being able to cheer on athletes
from your country who compete not for
money, but for Olympic glory. ‘

The Olympics as they are now have
nothing to do with any of that. It seems to
me as though the» motives behind starting
the modem Olympics (friendly competi-
tion, nationalism, etc.) have all be invalidat-

It’s a shame that something designed
with such great intentions could fall to the
level it has. The Olympics truly are a joke.
