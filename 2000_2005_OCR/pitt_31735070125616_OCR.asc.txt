Statue protestors
criticize $72,000
panther’s purchase

OLIVIA FAIRLEY
The Pitt News

Students and faculty gathered last
week outside the William Pitt Union to
watch the unveiling of the Millennium
Panther, ‘a bronze statue purchased by
Student Govemment Board three years ago.
But not everyone was there with a welcome
greeting.

Some students were there in protest,
upset that this new addition to the
University came at a cost of $72,000 —
money spent out of Pitt’s 1999 student
activity fee.

“There arealot of things tobeproud of

at this University, like the Cathedral of -'

Learning and the medical programs,” said
senior Sarah Root. “I don’t see how this
Panther will bring the University together.”
During his speech, SGB President J eff Alex
said he is hopeful that the new statue will
become a symbol of pride among the stu-
dents and help raise the school spirit that has

_ been lacking in the past few years.

As driving rain hurried the ceremony’s
speakers, a group of students gathered
behind the hedges on Bigelow Boulevard
with posters and megaphones.

Air National Guard parachuted onto the
ﬁeld, drawing roars of appreciation from
the crowd. K001 —— a member of K001 and
the Gang — sang the national anthem as
300 fans stretched the world’s largest
American ﬂag across the ﬁeld.

Pitt took an early lead in the game
when, on the ﬁrst possession, quarterback
David’ Priestley ran the ball back 85 yards
for a touchdown.

The crowd exploded, their cheers
drowning out the band’s victory song. But
the excitement was muﬁled when students
were asked to stay in their seats.

resulted in a huge ﬁnancial surplus, accord-
ing to SGB adviser, Joyce Giangarlo. She
said the activity fee was not raised to ftmd
the Panther.

In a later interview, Alex said the scope

- of the surplus money that was used to pur-

chase the Panther —- as a gift on behalf of
the student body to the University — was
 He said the money could not have
been used to ftmd any personal gifts to stu-

dents in the form of ﬁnancial aid. Nor, he

said, could the money have been given to
the Oﬂice of Admissions and Financial
Aid.

0 He said the board didlook into pur—_

chasing new computers for computer labs,
but that a gift like that would mean SGB
would be expected to repeat the gift armu-
ally.

“In no way whatsoever could that
money have gone to ﬁnancial aid or schol-
arships,”_Alex said. He continued, saying
protesters didn’t really understand the sys-

‘ tem and that if not spent, the surplus money

would have been lost altogether.

To combat student apathy in 1999, ‘

Alex told the crowd that Mongell and the

_ board decided to purchase a “symbol of

pride” for the University. Before introduc-
ing Mongell, Alex said that when the statue
arrived, it had a sign on it reading, “Do not
open til Christmas.” ‘ _
“We put a special call into Santa to ver-
ify that Pitt Day is close enough,” he said
Mongell said he was proud to present
the Panther as a symbol of die triumphs of
the past and a “testament to the future}?
Alex said that the board foresees the

4 Panther becoming a ﬁxture in Pitt lore and
. tradition. He added that the board expects

students to decorate the Panther “with a lot
of T-shirts.” He also said the Panther’s
rocky base is there for a reason — so that
students can climb atop the mascot.

“It’s not gomra break,” he said.

But just in case vandals have other
plans in mind, the Panther has been coated
with a special wax, Alex said, that will
allow paint to be rubbed off without per-
manent damage to the bronze. He said that
ﬂie Panther even came with additional wax
for future touch-ups.

By the time Nordenberg reached the
podium, rain wastorrential. The chancellor
made an on—the-spot decision to keep his
remarks short and thanked the crowd for
braving the weather. ~

“Boy,” he said, “anybody who lets go
of an umbrella to clap today is somebody
I’m indebted to for a long time.”

Between spurts of laughter shared with

C _the guest speakers and the crowd,

N ordenberg thanked Mongell, Alex and the
1999 student body.
'“I’m going to give you the history of

'.; . Y!..V, V

the Panther some other time,” he said,

-laughing.

He also thanked the students for giving
the University a “visible, permanent”
source of pride.

“Let’s formally welcome the newest
member of the University of Pittsburgh
community to the Oakland neighborhood,”

' he said.

The Pitt marching band played the

ﬁght song. as Nordenberg, Alex and l
« Mongell stripped the sheath from the

Panther.

p Protests, page 1

“We want our money back, the statue is
whack” and “Students not statues,” could be
heard over the addresses — delivered by
Alex, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and
1999 SGB President George Mongell —-—
ﬂiat focused on how the panther is an
important part of school spirit here at Pitt.
Jocelyn Homer, vice chair of the Non-
Traditional Student Caucus of the United
States Student Association took the mega-
phone and yelled “Hey Chancellor
Nordenberg, where is my $72,000? Give
me some money!”

Sophomore Samantha Lea attended the
protest because she felt the University’s pri-

orities are misaligned.

“I know too many students who could-
n’t come back to this school this year
because they didn’t have enough money,”
Lea said. “And now, the same year, $72,000
of the students’ money is put towards a stat-
ue. It’s not right”

Lisa Moriole, a Pitt sophomore and
USSA Atlantic regional chair, attended the
protest to criticize the University’s priorities,
saying that Pitt no longer seems focused on
its students. ‘

‘ Senior Stephanie Strazisar said the time
spent on the unveiling ceremony took more
effort than the University devotes to

explaining ﬁnancial aid information to the

students.

EDITORIAL

I am Pitt fan,

At Saturday’s opening football game at
Heinz Field, students had plenty of reason to
cheer. Pitt thrashed East Tennessee State 31-
0. Quarterback David Priestley ran a touch-
down most of the length of the ﬁeld.

Yet Heinz Field was surprisingly quiet.
In the fourth quarter, the student section
became loudest whenever Miarni’s lead
over Penn State ﬂashed on the large screen
— hardly something that helps motivate a
team that will not play Penn State for anoth-
er seven years. '

Pitt cannot regain its football glory
without the 12th Man. Banging on seats in
the student section was a welcome begin-
ning, but the team needs more.

The students should strive to be as cool
as the new stadium. Heinz Field is more
open than Pitt Stadium and Three Rivers
Stadium, so the noise isn’t as concentrated
Compensating for the difference is our
responsibility.

Because of recent controversies over
the noise level at Heinz Field, stadium ofﬁ-
cials seemed paranoid about irking North
Shore residents — even though the stadium
opens toward the rivers.

So students — typically the loudest fans
— were told by security guards to remain
seated. It’s obviously more diﬁicult to be an
enthusiastic fan when you’re conﬁned to
your seat.

Not that cheering at the right time was
all that easy in the ﬁrst place. The public

hear me roar

address system was almost inaudible and
the scoreboard difficult to see. V

It even proved tough to hear the band
Although the band was right by the student
section, hearing the good ol’ ﬁght songs was

. diﬂicult, if not impossible. They are called

ﬁght songs for a reason: They incite the
competitive spirit in the crowd and in the
team. -
The band should also make sure that
we can still chant after a touchdown — no
matter if we want to say the traditional
“ﬁght Pitt ﬁght” or tile more recent “Penn
State suc .”

Also, maybe some students were too
tired to cheer after their excessively long
walk from the student parking lot to the sta-
dium. Others may have been tired after
waiting for more than half an hour in line to
buy tickets outside the stadium.

And maybe others felt no reason to
cheer after J .T. Taylor did his rendition of
“The Star Spangled Banner.” His perfor-
mance left some desiring Roseanne Barr
take his place. _ ‘

We must remember, of course, that this
was just the ﬁrst game. Heinz Field is, over.-
all, a grand stadium, and one can easily tell
it is the home of both the Panthers and the

Steelers. But kinks still remain.

. Let’s hope that when the Panthers face
South Florida next week, students will be on 8
their feet cheering so loudly that the shouts
of victory will be heard throughout the city.

Curing global warming

Environmentalists who were skep-
tical of President George W. Bush’s
grasp on the global warrriing issue can
finally relax. He has now shown his
expertise by unveiling his new plan to
combat global warming by reviving
the Cold War. '

Yes, the Cold War is back and bet-
ter than ever. At least that’s the men-
tality around the White

would dictate that smaller countries
would be more — not less —— vulnera-

ble to the inevitable counterstrike.

Therefore, the -logic ' behind MAD
would apply better to the “rogue”_
nations‘ than to the United States or
Russia.

For example, it would

This plan is similar to
a plan formulated by the Reagan
administration during the Cold War,
but at a time when the technology was
not sufficient to carry outthe task.

Whether the technology is suffi-
cient today is debatable. But let’s
assume, for argumen_t’s sake, that the
technology does work and that the
United States can protect itself from a
nuclear strike. - .

The simple logic behind Mutually
Assured Destruction has kept the
peace for 50 years. MAD is the idea
that no country will launch nuclear
weapons without destroying its own
country in the inevitable counter-
strike.

Bush doesn’t think this logic will

determine who launched
the nuclear strike?
By protecting. itself, the United

States would also " no longer have a '
need to fear a nuclear counterstrike. »

Therefore, the only reason not to use
tactical nuclear weapons is political
backlash. And that is only a deterrent
if the United States cares how other
countries view_ it.

Bush cannot build the missile
defense shield without violating‘ a
1972 Anti—B allistic.Missile Treaty that
the United States signed with the
USSR. The Bush administration has
responded to this little roadblock by
announcing that unless Russia agrees

Miller, page 6

to amend the treaty to include a mis-
sile defense system, the United States
is going to unilaterally back out.
Pesky treaties, who needs them any-
way?

The negotiations around the 1972
ABM treaty include decreasing the
nuclear arsenals of United States and
Russia. But Bush will not offer any
specific numbers until the Pentagon
ﬁnishes its review toward the end of
the year. There is reason to believe
Bush will abandon the ABM treaty
sometime in November, possibly
before the Pentagon finishes its
review.

Bush also does not want a new
treaty or verification rules regarding
the arsenal cuts. After all, he would
not want to have to keep his word.

If Bush showed a lack of interest
in decreasing the United States’

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

nuclear arsenal, he veriﬁed it by open-
ly criticizing a program to remove 100
tons of weapons—grade plutonium
from the United States and Russia ——
50 tons from each country.

But why would Bush want to use
the nuclear arsenal he currently has
when a brand-new nuclear arsenal
would be much shinier? Newsweek
recently reported that the Bush admin-
istration is working on a multi—billion
dollar program to modernize _ the
United States’ capability of producing
nuclear weapons over the next 10
years. »

Any country with the ability to
launch nuclear weapons without fear
of a counterstrike would be a threat.

If that country also attempts to
modernize its ability to produce more
nuclear weapons while dancing
around negotiations to decrease its
nuclear arsenal, it would be consid-
ered a greater threat.

If that country also backed out of a
treaty that has been a cornerstone of
international nuclear peace for 50

years, that country would be a serious.

threat. ‘

Well that country is the United
States. Bush is turning the United
States from an international peace-
keeper to an international threat. Other
nations will react in the same manner

such a threat, enlarging their nuclear

As the sole international super-

would be futile. But this view neglects.

States in a nuclear arms race in the

One such power is China. It has a

Another power may be a more
unified Europe. Already, Europe has
become more economically unified
through the adoption of the Euro.‘ It
has also acted as a solid front against
the United States in the United“

Nations recently.

If the United States is seen as a_

threat, China, Europe and possibly

with their own nuclear armsincreases

Pitt beat East Tennessee State
31-0 in front of 47,919 fans, to
christen Heinz Field and win its
first game of the season.

“If you Awould’ve told me in

ETSU’s option offense stunned

After a 10-yard first-down pass
to junior wide receiver Lamar Slade

cut right and sprinted 85 yards for a
touchdown.

The defense didn’t catch on
until Priestley was 30 yards down-
field, and he began celebrating and
waving his hands above his head 10
yards from the end zone.

“Lou carried out the fake really
well, and everyone else was block-
ing that run play,” said Priestley,
whose touchdown run was the
longest rush for a quarterback in
Pitt history and the sixth-longest
overall. “I pulled it and took off.”

But it didn’t take long for things
to take a sour note for Pitt.

Saturday evening marked the beginning of a
new chapter in Pitt football history, and, after-
ward, the Panthers used a number of phrases to
describe their first game at Heinz Field.

“Star struck,” said head coach Walt Harris.

“Nervous,” said freshman running back
Raymond Kirkley.

“Unsettled,” added tackle Mike Bosnic, refer-
ring to Pitt’s performance on the field.

_ No matter what emotions the players were
feeling, their 31-0 victory over the East Tennessee
State Buccaneers was a game of many firsts.

Starting with the Panthers’ first possession in

in the’. stadium. Priestley’s 85-yard touchdown

was not only the first rushing touchdown‘ at Heinz
Field, but also the first of his college career.

“I was winded and almost fell in the end

Also during that first possession, Kirkley

In the first full weekend of college football, the
Big East Conference shined with six wins and only
two losses, one of which was to another conference
team. Temple and Rutgers got their seasons started
on Thursday when Temple hosted Navy and
Rutgers traveled north to take on Buffalo.

Temple 45, Navy 26

The Temple Owls started their
campaign for their_ first winning
season since 1979 with an abun-
dance of running. Jason McKie led
the Owls with 120 yards on 11 car—
ries and a touchdown. Temple out-
gained the Middies 319 to 89 yards
on the ground alone. Temple took"
an early 10-0 lead in the game and,
after McKie’s touchdown, led 17-6 at halftime.
After a punt return from Zamir Cobb for a touch-
down, the Owls led 31-13 and never looked back.

Rutgers 31, Buffalo 15

Rutgers dominated their first game of the year
on the road in Buffalo as they controlled the entire
game and led 20-0 at halftime. Rutgers rushed for
196 yards and forced 21 Buffalo punts.

Miami 33, Penn State 7

The fans in Beaver Stadium rose to their feet
and applauded Adam Taliaferro as he led Penn
State onto the field after being paralyzed llmonths

ago. The Penn State fans remained seated for the
rest of the game as they watched the No. 2-ranked
Miami Hurricanes dominate every aspect of the
game. Heisman Trophy candidate and quarterback

Ken Dorsey led the way with three touchdown T

passesand completed 20 of A27 pas_ses for 344

yards. Hurricanes kicker Todd Sievers‘ added four 3

field goals of 37,42, 36 and 23 yards respectively to
win Larry Coker’s first game as Miami’s coach and
to keep Penn State coach Joe
Patemo sitting at 322 career wins,
one shy of Bear Bryant’s all-time
mark.

Tennessee 33, Syracuse 9
Syracuse opened their sea-
son two weekends ago with a loss
to Georgia Tech, and their woes
continued on Saturday against
Tennessee. The Orangemen con-
verted on only one of their 14 third-down opportu-
nities. However, with all of Syracuse’s mishaps,
Tennessee only led 12-0 at halftime. Tennessee run-
ning back Travis Stephens had a touchdown in the
third quarter and was followed up by two touch-

down runs from freshman Corey Larkin in the

fourth quarter.

Virginia Tech 52, Connecticut 10

school, the Connecticut Huskies kept with the
Hokies for an entire quarter, keeping the score at

“I’m glad [Harris] still had faith
in me after 5 yards in the first half.”

Harris has high hopes for
Kirkley’s career.

“Ray’s going to be a fine foot-
ball player for us,” Harris said of
Kirkley. “He gives us some different
speed than the other backs do. He’s
going to continue to improve.”

On the first play of the second’
quarter, backup quarterback Rod
Rutherford, who also ran for a
touchdown, had a first of his own:
Rutherford completed his first pass
in Pitt uniform to R.J. English for an
11-yard gain.

However, the drive stalled after
that as the Panthers gained just 8
more yards on three plays. ’

Late in o the second quarter,
Priestley completed an 11-yard pass
to sophomore receiver Yogi Roth.
Despite the fact that the completion
left Pitt 9 yards short of a first down,
the catch. was the first for Roth.

Roth, who filled in for the
injured Antonio Bryant, caught five
passes for a- total of 50 yards.

“Yogi did some nice things,”
Harris said.

ET SU also endured a first of its
own. Saturday marked the
Buccaneers’ first game with quarter-
back Matt Wilhjem leading the team.
