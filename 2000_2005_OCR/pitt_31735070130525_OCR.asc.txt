Students help host

Bush Downtown

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN

News Editor

For the second time in four days, Pittsburgh played host to a
major party presidential candidate, and for the second time in four
days, Pitt students played a major role in hosting the event.

Gov. George W. Bush made his stop Downtown yesterday, at
a rally before several thousand supporters and a healthy sprinkling
of protesters. ‘ 

, Pitt’s College Republicans learned" of the event on Monday,
just after Vice President Al Gore’s Labor Day visit. President Nick
Havens received word of the visit from the Bush campaign, and in
the few days before the event, he and the republicans spent hours

painting and preparing signs for the rally.
' The signs“ bore slogans like “W is for Women” and ”“We

Believe.”

Havitz and nearly 30 other College Republicans served on

crowd control. ‘

“If a Gore supporter somehow gets on the premises, and starts
instigating trouble, our job is to temper that,” Havens said.’
In addition to watching out for Democrats, Havens and the rest

Democrats gather Downtown to protest Bush

, SHANNON McLAUGHLlN
News Editor

While Republicans joyously hailed

the arrival of Gov. George W. Bush a few,

hundred feet away, Democrats gathered
from organizations city-wide to march and
chant in passionate protest.

‘University Democrat President
Stephanie Strazisar said approximately 35
students made the trip Downtown to the 6
p.m. rally to show their support for Vice
President Al Gore amidst the pro-Bush
hoopla.

Students, she said, came either solely
to support Gore as an individual, or ‘also to
support the campaign for Youth Vote 2000.

Youth Vote 2000 is a proposed debate‘

between the Texas governor and the vice
president, with questions being posed by
Americans from 18- to 30—years-old.

. Strazisar called the event ‘‘non-parti- ‘
san,” and reported that Gore had already

agreed. .
College Republicans President Nick
Havens expressed disbelief.

“Gore has made a lot of promises
[regarding the debates],” he said. He.con-
tinued to say that the vice president has
broken his promises, and asked, “Why

should we believe this?”
University Democrat members Joe

0 Constanty, a junior, and Sara Fusco, a

senior, managed to infiltrate the VIP seat-
ing area at the republican rally and ques-
tion the governor’s stance on Youth Vote
2000. . 0

‘‘[Being there] turned my stomach,”
Fusco said, “But I didn’t want to get beat
up by a bunch of big Republicans.”

Fusco said she cheered meekly for
Bush to avoid raising suspicions. I

.Constanty, she said, was being sized
up by the Secret Service.

He yelled, “Youth Vote 2000”_during-

the govemor’s,speech, and, as Bush con-

cluded the event,‘ Constanty yelled at ques-A —

tion to him about his position on the youth
vote. ‘
“He said he had no idea about it,”

Constanty said. “He said he’d look into it.” '

While Constanty and Fusco acted as

secret agents on the inside, union laborers t

protested outside with the rest of the
University Democrat contingent.

“It wasso. great to look across the
street and see the Working Families for
Gore and Bush,” Fusco said.

Havens disagreed.

“I think .it shows that we have a little
more dignity than they do,” he said.

Democrats showed up at Republican presidential-hopeful George W. Bush's

in classes to obtain a bachelor’s
degree, to enroll in courses for per-
sonal enrichment or professional
advancement or to prepare for a
graduate program. _

Bobenage faces a sizeable job in
this newly created position, because
many people do not know about the
college and its benefits.

“The position was “basically
needed in order to increase the

“visibility of CGS in the community,” .

Bobenage said.

Her first project is to expand the
college’s existing programs, includ-
ing the Pitt Informal Program. and
the College for the Over 60.

For about 25 years, the Pitt
Informal Program offers non—credit
courses and academic and recre-
ational workshops to people over the

age of 15...

Equallyobscure is the College I’
for the Over 60, which was founded‘

in 1974 and enables senior citizens
to take undergraduate courses. I  4

“People just don’t know that
these prograrns» exist,” said

Bobenage. “We have quite a chal- I

lenge to makepeople aware?’ :

-She said the College for the . A
Over 60 has grown by word of V.

mouth, but CGS wants to raise com-

munity awareness to expand the'pro—,
' gram. A . ‘ » '

Bobenage said that there ar
approximately 1,000 students in the
over-60 program, “but we certainly

A have room to expand,” she said.

The second element of the new

position is to make improvements to A~

both programs. CGS is broadening

the courses offered in order to create .

a larger variety.

The community’s response has a
big impact on how the programs are
improved and changed Bobenage is

working on a survey to reveal com- _
munity response to a program and.

how it can be improved.

Bobenage said that the resources
and expertise within the Uniyersity
are full of opportunities.

“I hope to tap some of [the
resources] and offer -them to the
public,” she said.

‘ BRENTIN MOGK
The Pitt News

The first black mayor of a major
city in the United States took office in
Cleveland in 1967. Carl Stokes took
office the same time as a young
Michael White, heavily inﬂuenced by

' Stokes, was being sworn in as president

of the City Wide Student Council, a stu-

dent governing body presiding over all

public schools in the Cleveland area.
White is now the mayor of

-Cleveland. '

In 1997, Jamar Doyle, heavily

’ inﬂuenced by White, took over as pres-

ident of the City Wide Student Council.

In following with this trend, is it
feasible that Doyle may be shining in
30 years or so as mayor of Cleveland or
possibly Pittsburgh?

‘ “Well, yes, that’s exactly what I
intend to do,” he beams rather
ambitiously. ‘ ’

With what looks like the begin-
nings of a rather lofty resume, his aspi-
rations may’ not be far from reach.
Already, Doyle has tackled being the
president of the Urban Studies
Association last year and is currently
the’Black Action Society President. He
is-“employed in Pittsburgh Mayor Tom
Murphy’s Office of Neighborhood

' _ Policy and is closing out his undergrad-

uate college career with a dual degree

: in political science and urban studies.

Doyle is, to quote the famous slang,

I “‘bout it”. No girlfriend: too time con-

suming, he contends.

A typical day for Doyle would
offend slackers. From. 8 a.m. to noon
he’s hard at work at the mayor’s ofﬁce

, where he’s fulﬁlling his internship.’
‘ Classes begin for him right after and
I usually last until 6 p.m. at the earliest or

8 p.m. at the latest. In between classes

he’s honoring his office duties for BAS. ‘

Doyle gets home about 10 or 11 p.m.

' where he does homework until about 2

or 3 a.m.

Certainly, this is a rather strenuous "

schedule for the average college stu-

_ dent, but given Doyle’s family back-

ground; this is what is expected of the
oldest of five children. His father is a
computer engineer at Pitt and his moth-
er is an’ education specialist involved in

in different cities, Doyleremains equal-

“ ly encouraged by, each of his parent’s

positions in their respective communi-
ties. While divorce may be damaging to
many, the experience has ‘left Doyle
with no scars. .

“Not only did I have a father ﬁgure
in. my life, but I’ve had two moms to

‘ grow upwith,” he said, .referring’to his

stepmother. “I really feel blessed.”
‘Throughout most of his life Doyle

. was raisedby his grandparents. One of

the most miserable moments in his life
was watching his grandmother suc-
cumb to Alzheimer’s disease. At her
time of passing she was bedridden and
hardly recognized anyone in her family
including Doyle. _

“The hardest thing about it was
watching her deteriorate,” he said. “I
could remember when she was alive

and lively all the way to the point where

her mind and soul had totally escaped
her.”

“ Doyle was 15 when his grandmoth-
er died. He strongly insists that every-
thing he does is in her honor. His grand-
father still remains a pivotal ﬁgure in
his life. It perplexes Doyle that at 79 his
grandfather still “kicks it at the club”

 

BAS president hasfull plate andhigh expectations

and won’t let him use the car.

Doyle credits his family and his
church rearing for granting him with
the fundamental values necessary for
his'current success. He deems himself a
leader, especially for black students at
Pitt. In recognizing this he understands
the moral and upstanding nature .of his
political calling.

“[Religion] is ultimately funda-
mental,” he fervently avows, “It shapes
you as a person. I wouldn’t be at this
University if not for God.”

Members of his steering committee
for BAS have nothing but love and
uplifting words for their president.

“He’s blessedly reliable,”. said Tara
Turman, his chairwoman for member-

k ore For Lss!
  A  Anytime

ship. “He has the correct set of qualities
and characteristics which makes him an
excellent leader.” .
Although he admits that his current
position as president of BAS is often
challenging, he marks it as being a very
rewarding ‘experience. Doyle’s entrance
into the leading role for BAS came
amid controversies which were signs of
disorganization and disarray already
existing within the group. .

"Fortunately, though, Doyle’s cur-

rent administration has been able to
rebound and restructure itself to where
it has functioned more efﬁciently than
previous regimes?

I on Sept. 13, 40 Pitt students, along

with 633 other students from universities
across the country, will board the S.S.
Universe Explorer. . .
Leaving from Vancouver Canada,
students will begin their 3 1/2 month

-, adventure with Semester at Sea, a study

abroad program based at Pitt. Starting in
Japan and ending in Cuba on Dec. 17,
these students will travel to 10 countries
including China, Vietnam, Malaysia,
India, Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Cuba.

In the next few Weeks before their

departure, the students will be busy
preparing for their trip.

" Preparation‘~can get hectic when it
involves everything from getting almost
$200 worth of vaccinations to ﬁlling out
complicated forms while worrying if
your visas will come in on time. .

' Many shipboard students fear being
so far‘ away from home without the

prospect of visiting home for several

months. A
For Alisia Bentz, a senior psycholo-
gy and anthropology major, leaving her
comfort zone is something she fears.
“I’m a little nervous about leaving all
of my friends and being immersed in a
situation that is totally new and strange,”

adrift sept. 13  

Bentz said.

But for Bentz, the chance to meet
new people was something she just
couldn’.t pass up.

, “This is a once in a lifetime opportu-
nity to interact with other people in their
own cultures,” she said.

Christin Glover, a junior anthropolo-
gy major, has yet another reason for tak-
ing the trip — shyness. -

"‘I’m shy about meeting newpeople
and I hope that going on Semester at Sea
will help me with that,” Glover said.

For her major, Glover also hopes to
use the voyage to help her ﬁnd a topic for
the thesis she has to write before she
graduates. '

Obey your stomach and
not nutrition rumors

“Egg-citing news” read the head-
line of the lead story in the food section
of yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The story, in which the American Heart
Association defends the egg as health-
ful and tasty, is the latest chapter in the

A ongoing dramatic saga that is the world

of poultry and dairy products.

Our generation has witnessed
tumultuous ﬂuctuation in the populari-
ty and reputation of numerous farm-
fresh items. In the fat-phobic 1990s, ’
any milk other than skim was feared,
and yet those “Got ads continue
to bombard us with reasons, ranging
from preventing osteoporosis to main-
taining stronger teeth and gums, for
why milkreally does a body good

Cheese has come under ﬁre all too
frequently. Besides being potentially
fattening, vast portions of the popula-
tion are apt to ﬁnd any product made of

curdled milk just plain gross. The Food .

and Drug Administration is currently
considering banning a slew of fancy-
schmancy cheeses such as Roquefort
on the basis that they are made with
unpasteurized milk, which may contain '
pathogens even though they undergo a
60-day aging process. Impassioned
cheese lovers and producers from
Boston to Wisconsin have united to
form the Cheese of Choice Coalition in
hopes of preventing the ban.

Yogurt has not survived the last
few decades unscathed, either.
Recently, there was a small uproar
about yogurt that contains aspartame,
an artiﬁcial sweetener that was
rumored to cause cancer. Despite this,
moms and health nuts everywhere con-
tinue to swear by it

In this crazy world, where the
same food item that is a star one day is
rendered a villain the next by proposed
rumors of its fat content or carcinogenic
nature, what’s a hip, health-conscious
consumer to do?

Simple — today’s consumer must

-take nutritional advice with a grain of
salt It’s not difficult to ﬁgure things out ,

on one’s own ——. a prescription of an
active lifestyle and moderation in all
things will work for just about anyone.
For those who are really serious, Pitt
offers free consultation with dietitians
through Student Health Services.

The scoop these days, according to
some sources, is that chocolate may
actually be good for you, and eating
pound upon pound of mushrooms per
day might cause cancer. It’s difﬁcult to
keep abreast of‘ all the health rumors,
and nearly impossible to determine
which are actually true. ‘Instead of

- attempting to do so, just use common

sense and learn to listen to the rum-
blings of your tummy.

On a night when the sky is filled with
stars, I tend to look up-and wonder if other
life forms really do exist out there. Over
the summer, I had one of those nights. It
was a warm night in July, the sun had just
set and lightning bugs ﬂickered every-
where.

As I sat on my deck, knees
curled up to my chin, I stared up
at the sky for a while. The stars
twinkled, the moon lit the heav-
ens, and I thought about the uni-
verse as a whole and how massive it truly
is! .

I continued to stare at the glowing
stars, only small points of light to us, but
massive bodies in their own right. This got

tance; planets we are completely unable to
see. Knowing that all of these things exist,
a strange feeling crept over me —— I know
almost for sure, that we are not alone; we
are not the only life forms in this universe.

I don’t quite know what my eyes, scan-
ning __the heavens, looked for that night.
Was I hoping to see a shooting star or a
comet? Or was I hoping to see something a
little more unusual? ‘ .

There are eight known planets besides
Earth in our solar system alone and it sur-

« prises me to think _that there is no’ life on
any of them. Also, other planets that we are
currently unaware of may exist around

. other stars, thus increasing the chances that
other life forms exist as well.

Television certainly does a good job
bringing the topic of aliens into the human
conscious. Movies such as. “E.T.,” ‘-‘Fire in
the Sky” and “The Coneheads” represent
different attitudes that human beings har-
bor regarding extraterrestrials. “Fire in the

claimed that aliens abducted ' him.

KENNETH PAUL

Senior Staff Writer P

Before Pitt can look toward hook-
ing up with Penn State, they must first
get by the Bowling Green Falcons.

The visit will mark the first time
Pitt has ever traveled to a Mid-
American Conference team. Last week,
Pitt defeated Kent State, another team
from the MAC, 30-7.

The Falcons come into the game
with an 0-1 record after losing to 4th-
ranked Michigan, 42-7. The team has-
n’t had a winning season since 1994.

On Saturday, at Doyt L. Perry
Stadium, Pitt will attempt to win their
first road opener since 1993. Facing
Bowling Green for the second time,
Pitt leads the series 1-0 after beating
Bowling Green, 30-10, last season at
Pitt Stadium.

The Falcons went 5-6 last season

Against the Wolverines, top return-
ing rusher Godfrey Lewis carried the
ball 10 times for 17 yards. Fullback

John Gibson had seven rushes for 28 P
yards and Joe Alls ran the ballfour .

times for eight yards.

The Panthers’ defensive line will
be slightly revamped as Mike White
and Joe Conlin will start in the interior.

The linebacking corps will stay
intact, as head coach Walt Harris said
that he was pleased with Brandon
Williams’ effort.

Redshirt freshman Corey
Humphries will start at free safety for

the injured Gary Urschler with Robb 1

at the position until Ramon Walker

Editor’s Note: This is the second in a
“Greatest Games” series that will appear in
The Pitt News the day before each Pitt foot-
ball game this year. Each part in the series
will detail Pitt’s greatest game against that
week’s opponent, and will contain the origi-
nal game story as it appeared» in The Pitt
News. This story was written
by Mario Machi and pub-
lished on Sept. 7, 1999.

Pitt head football coach
Walt Harris used only one
word to describe his feelings
about the Panthers’ "30—10
season—opening win against
Bowling Green:

“Overjoyed.”

Pitt hadn’t won a football
game since the fourth game last year, against
Akron, which led to a string of seven losses
to close the season in 1998. ‘ .

The Panthers overcame a slow start to
blow the game open in the third quarter, scor-

ing 20 points with junior John Turman at the
helm. ' »

I / / J , 4

 

Turman entered the game at the start of
the second quarter, replacing sophomore
David Priestley, who completed one of five
passes for 6 yards in the opening frame. A

The Panthers won the toss to start the
game but deferred possession until the start
of the second half. Bowling Green’s offense
moved down the field, but
Pitt’s bend—but-don’t-break
philosophy worked in this
case, resulting in a fourth-
and-five for the Falcons on
the Pitt 35-yard line.

Bowling Green quar-
terback Ricky Schneider
took a short drop but was
heavily pressured by Panther
linebacker Ken Kashubara,
and the pass attempt was

incomplete. ,

Priestley led the Pitt offense onto the
field and immediately completed a short pass
to Kenny Ketchen. That was Priestley’s only
completion of the day.

The Pitt News

Three top teams in women’s vol-
leyball will be coming to the
University this weekend for the Pitt
Invitational. _ .

The matches will be a measuring
stick for a Panthers team looking to
return to the top of the Big East
Conference and earn national respect.

The Panthers have a new coach in
Chris Beerman, who brings a new atti-

 
 

1  

tude to a program with the talent to be
a serious contender for the Big East
championship. So far, the team has
turned its potential into results.

Pitt opened the season at the
Carolina Fall Preview with matches

against East Carolina, North Carolina,
» Hofstra, and Coastal Carolina. '

The Panthers won three out of four
contests, dropping the match against

North Carolina and winning solidly in
_their other efforts. '

Since then, the Panthers returned
home and soundly beat Duquesne.
They now await their biggest test of
the young season. v

Beerman, who left a James
Madison team considered one of the
top 30 in the country at the time of his
departure, says he had high expecta-
tions for the Panthers coming into the
season.

“When you inherit a team, _you”“

never know what exactly you’ve got,”
said Beerman. “We’Ve improved every
match, though, especially against
Duquesnc where we played extremely

’ well.” .

To succeed this ‘weekend, the
ladies will have to step "up their level
of play. The three teams coming to’
town. are all well respected by.
Beerman. T ‘

Arkansas might beconsidered the
marquee opponent." Since adding
women’s volleyball to their athletic

matches against Penn State ' and,
Southern Cal, two nationally ranked
schools. 2

Miami of Ohio is also trying to A

move up. According to Beerman, the
Redhawks “have been the top team in

the Mid-American Conference for 20 » 0

years,” but Miami is in a rebuilding

stage at-the moment. _ .-
The team returns only one starter;

from last year’s squad, and is depend-

ing on its younger players coming- ~

together in time tomake a run at the
MAC tournament title.

Miami has a 2-2 record, and is
looking to turn its solid efforts into

Pitt running back Nick Goings,
playing his first game for Pitt after
transferring from Ohio State, broke
through the line for a big 14-yard
gain to move the Panthers into

Falcons territory, and a '15-yard

penalty for a late hit put Pitt in field-
goal range. However, kicker Nick
Lotz could not convert from 38 yards
out, and the game remained scoreless.

Bowling Green continued to look
impressive on offense,-as a 28-yard
‘run by tailback Godfrey Lewis put
the ball in Panthers territory. The

Falcons kept moving the ball with ,

short gains until they had a fourth-

and-one at the Pitt 26-yard line an

decided again to go for it. A
This time, Pitt safety Mark Ponko
came up to make the big hit, stopping
fullback John Gibson for no gain.
Pitt could not get anything going
on offense, and the Falcons gained
the possession again. Schneider

passed‘ to Kurt Gerling, but Pitt»

defensive back Hank Poteat stripped
the ball away, and the fumble was
recovered by Ryan Gonsales.

The game continued its slow pace
until Bowling Green had the ball with
about 13 minutes remaining in the

’ second quarter. Facing a third—and-

10, Schneider was drilled by defen-
sive back Demetrius Rich, and
although the Falcons recovered the

1- fumble, the momentum swing was
« obvious.

’ On the next play, Ponko broke
through the line and blocked Patrick
Fleming’s punt into the arms of Pitt’s
Nick Cole, who ran it back 15 yards
to the Bowling Green 5-yard line.

Turman then entered the game for
Pitt, but he did not pay immediate
dividends, as his third—down pass was
dropped by Kevan Barlow in the end
zone . Lotz made a 24-yard. field goal
to give Pitt the 3-0 lead.

Bowling Green bounced right

‘ back, using good running from Lewis

and some nice passes by Schneider to
move the ball deep into Pitt’s side of
the. field. An illegal-block penalty
negated a touchdown and moved the
Falcons back to Pitt’s 22-yard line,
facing a first-and-18.

This did not deter Schneider,

’ "however, as the quarterback fired a

22-yard strike to Robert Redd for the
firsttouchdown of the game, and the

1 - Falcons had a 7-3 lead.

, ’ Pitt took the lead for good with a
drive .that started with about four
minutes remaining in the first half. A
40-yard punt return by Poteat had the
Panthers in good field position.

Turman ‘hit freshman Antonio

1 Bryant for completions of 7 and 20

yards on consecutive plays, setting up
Goings’ 1-yard touchdown run. Lotz
nailed the extra point, and Pitt took a

1 910-7 lead into halftime.

'l'm=. Pin NEWS

. The Panthers came out strong in
the second half with a quick drive
that spanned 66 yards over nine
plays, resulting in a fourth-and-goal
bootleg run by Turman for the Pitt
touchdown, and the lead was now 17-
7. 
The Panthers’ defense tightened,
and the Falcons’ offense could not get

anything done in the third quarter. ‘On___

the next Falcons possession,
Schneider once again completed a
pass to Gerling, only to see him hit by
redshirt freshman safety Ramon
Walker, forcing another turnover,
which was recovered by D.J. Dinkins
at the Bowling Green 32-yard line.
Turman capped the next drive for
Pitt with a spectacular 26-yard touch-
down pass to Bryant. Turman’s pass
was a bit under-thrown, but Bryant

reached-"over the defensive back to
pull the ball in for the Panthers’
score.“ Lotz missed the extra point,
but Pitt still had a 23-7 advantage.
Bowling Green’s offense did not
help its chances, as Steve Holmes

fumbled a handoff from Schneider, ’

which was recovered by Gonsales at
the Falcon 31-yard line. ,

, An 18-yard run by Goings, plus
an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty
on the Falcons. had Pitt in position to
score again. Goings turned an off-
tackle run into a sweep wide to the
left, scoring again to put Pitt up 30-7
with 2:32 remaining in the third quar-
ter.

Most of the fourth quarter was
taken up in a Bowling Green drive
that lasted 12 minutes. The drive
totaled 23 plays and 88 yards, result-

ing in a 19-yard field goal by Jason
Strasser that set the final margin.

After the game, most of the talk
was about the big plays that changed
the course of the game.

Bryant said that he. and Turman
had talked about their chemis't‘r.y_ ear-
lier in the week.  1

“I told, John just to build confi-
dence. Trust me, trust me, that’s what
I told him,” said the freshmanifrom
Miami. 5

Bryant’s success may have been a
direct result of the Falcons’ coverage
of all-Big East wide receiverfjLatef
Grim. Grim had only one catch in the
game for a total of 9 yards. Bryant
gave him credit, though.

THE P111 NEws

ERIDAV, SEPTEMBER 8, 2000

PREVIEW

The position looks to be very deep
as R.J. English and Lamar Slade had
strong performances last week.

English caught two balls for 128
yards and one touchdown and Slade
added four catches for 50 yards with
two touchdowns.

Harris hinted that third—string quar-
terback Rod Rutherford may get a
chance at receiver.

Bowling Green has an undersized

The Falcons defense gave up an
astounding 554 total yards last week.
Michigan freshman quarterback John
Navarre completed 15-of-29 passes for
265 yards and four touchdowns in
place of injured starter Drew Henson.

Look for Pitt to punish the Falcons’
defense and pound the ball up the mid-
dle, as their defense tends to tire late in
the game, Michigan put up 21 points
last week in the fourth quarter,

Last year, Pitt had a three point
lead at halftime, but broke. the game

weekend, it will be the first time a Mid-
American Conference team will host the
Panthers.

All week, the Falcons have been
very kind to us here at The Pitt News
and only now do I know why.

In 82 years of football, Pitt is the
most prestigious college football team
to visit Bowling Green, Ohio, Southern
Mississippi, Temple and Navy are the
only other major Division I colleges to
visit the “Black Swamp.” "

I am honored to make the four—hour
trip. But, the Falcons are 1-0 at home

against Big East teams. They beat

Temple in 1996, 20-16.

tor of The Pitt News and is not looking

list of schools competing. The
Hoosiers are attempting to improve on
what many considered to be their best
year ever.

FROM PAGE 12

In 1999, a corps of seniors led the“

team to the NCAA tournament for the
second year in a row, finishing with a
20-11 overall record.

The Hoosiers did lose seven expe-
rienced players from a year ago, but
are confident that the six returning
players will be able to carry the weight
of expectations. '

So far, the confidence is justified,
as Indiana has marched to a 3-0 record

with wins over Cincinnati, Bowling

Green, and Loyola-Chicago.

The Panthers’. play against all -

three teams will show just how far

they still have to go before thinking of -

their first NCAA playoff berths since
1994.

Beerman is certainly viewing the
tournament‘ as a very important one.

“You could look at [the teams Pitt '

will play] as overwhelming,”Beerman
said. “If we do well, it can establish

' Pittas a toptprogram and I’m excited

to see how the team will respond to the
competition.”

There are still obstacles in the
team’s path, though. Beerman sees his

team as one that has the talent to twin 6
now, but knows that talent can only -

take a team so far.

‘ “At James Madison, we started
from scratch ta1ent—wise and built the
program up,” Beerman said.

He compared the Panthers to the

JMU teams he coached and said that
although this year’s team is ahead
physically, but they need to improve
their mental focus. ’ ’

All that aside, Beerman knows a
couple wins this weekend would go a
long way towards restoring Pitt’s
national volleyball prominence.

“If we win, it’s. an indication that
we’ve arrived.”
