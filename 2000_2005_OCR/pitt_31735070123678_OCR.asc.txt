a special committee to study
the issue.

Assembly members unani-

ad hoc committee to examine
the question of how to respond
to ‘pressures from beyond the

appropriate courses of action

Pitt’s cost for “free” bus rides maygo up

he University may have

to pay more to continue

its ride-for—free service
for Pitt I.D. holders.

This year, Pitt is paying the
Port Authority of Allegheny
County $2 .5 million in exchange
for county-wide free rides on
Port Authority buses and trolleys
for students, faculty and staff.

But the Port Authority, facing
a deﬁcit in its current operating
budget, probably will push for a

* fare increase, said Port Authority

spokesperson Bob Grove.

“If we do have a fare increase
for our customers, we will ask the
University for a corresponding
increase, the same as we did last
year,” Grove said.

The Port Authoritylast raised

its fares on April 1, 2001, its ﬁrst '
, fare hike in a decade. Cash fares

went up by 35 cents to $1.60
(a 28 percent increase) while

the price of discounted» fare .

programs such as weekly and
monthly bus passes — the Port
Authority calls them “pre-paid

fare instruments” — increased
by 20 percent. '
The Port Authority

requested, and received, a 20
percent increase from Pitt effec-
tive last Aug. 1, hiking the

‘University’s annual cost by

$420,000 to $2.5 million.
Before it can increase its fares,
the Port Authority must hold

‘ public hearings and‘ its board

must approve the hikes. That ’
.process probably would take

‘at least until next fall, Grove
said. .

“Given the—shortfall in our
state funding, it’s probably
inevitable that we will be forced
to request a fare increase',”— he

said. “But there has been no

ofﬁcial determination of how
much the increase would be or
when it would take effect.

“It’s fair to expect, though,
that we would ask the University
for the same percentage increase
that we would be charging our
pre-paid fare instrument hold-
ers,” Grove said.

UNIVERSITY SENATE

IV! A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

The resolution of the Environmental Law
Clinic problem was exquisitely timed. It preceded
by a scant few days the March 18 University Senate
plenary" session titled, “The Corporatization of
the University.” There is a good bit of credit to be
shared among the School of Law, the University
administration and parts of the University Senate
for the result that permits the clinic to operate
A within the framework of the School of Law. One
might have expected that successful outcome to have blunted
some of the criticism that theplenary session speaker, David
F. Noble of York University, Ontario, Canada, directed at the
Pitt administration. Even if it did somewhat, he found much
to criticize, with several speciﬁc references to the chancellor’s
involvement with a variety of business-related entities.

The March 2 1 University Times contained extensive coverage
of Professor Noble’s remarks and subsequent comments._ One
might sum up his talkin a single sentence: Universities are
dominated through their links to corporate America and they
will do just about anythingin their pursuit of money to keep the
enterprise going, regardless of the interests of students, faculty
and the broader community.

I would like to share several thoughts about his talk. First,
many of the changes at universities that he described, and that
he fears are destroying them, are -evident here at Pitt. The
harmful effects of Corporatization, to the extent they exist, differ
considerably among the various academic units. At Pitt the
question is not about its ties and the faculty’s ties with business

 

are being sacriﬁced as a result. Much has been written about
the inﬂuence of the drugmanufacturers on research’ and other
activities of medical school faculty members, and some of the
concerns expressed about these links may be relevant on this
campus. I doubt thereis any industry that combines ﬁnancial
and politicalpower more effectively than the pharmaceutical
industry.‘ Witness the failure of Congress to enact a Medicare
prescription drug beneﬁt.‘ A . ‘

Second, Professor Noble did not offer any suggestions for
resisting, or controlling, the excesses brought about by what
he terms Corporatization. I have a poster in my ofﬁce stating,
“Clients want answers, not information.” In the practice of law

I_quic_kly__learned that people ,vv_a,nt_ ,a,nsw_,ers_, not justa recital. of; - ‘

problems. Professor Noble would have been more effective) if '
he had put forth’ some ideas for how a university administration
and faculty that want to avoid domination by industry might
respond to the pressures they face. I would not expect a
solution, but some thoughts on the subject would have been
welcome. » ' 1 ' '
Third, Professor Noble spoke disparagingly of university
leaders generally, likening them to corporate CEOs, but having
greater power than their counterparts in the corporateworld.
He went on to contrast current university leaders unfavorably
with the university leaders of days gone by, at least one of whom
he quoted from as a strong supporter of the traditional values of
the university. My reaction is that he is romanticizing the past.
I remember well the days when many universities, and most
schools of medicine, had rigid admission quotas for Jews, and
certain others, on racial, religious and ethnic grounds. Some‘
of those university presidents of the past — during the 19th
century and up until after World War II —— who spoke glowingly
of the values and ideals of the university, countenanced,_if not

of public institutions of higher learning, and many private
institutions, did not admit African-American students until the‘
civil rights legislation of the 19603.

A As‘ to faculty appointments, in the 19th and early 20th
centuries, many faculties consisted largely of individuals with
independent means, drawn from the social and economic elite.
These were not the children of recent immigrants. If it was
difficult to get admitted, imagine the difficulty faced by a member,
of a disfavored group to secure a faculty appointment. ~

I don’t buy the idea that there was a golden age of university
life that is now disappearing. I doubt that the contemplative
life of the ‘mind ﬂourishedon many, if any campuses, in days
past. One may wonder whether the WASP-elite domination"
of academic institutions in the past was any less pernicious
in its impact upon the behavior and performance of students
and faculty than the corporate domination that troubles
Professor Noble. ‘

Senate plenary sessions are meant to stimulate thought and

and speakers are selected by, or with the approval of, the Senate
leadership. Those who participated in the decision—making
with respect to the most recent plenary session made good
choices. Professor Noble was provocative and he clearly had the

1916, with the purpose of assisting faculty to gain the opportunity 1
to participate meaningfully in university governance. Obviously,
things were not close to perfect in institutions of higher
education in that era. '

will be renovated as required
to relocate athletic activities,
except swimming, from Trees
Hall-,” according to a project
description distributed to trust-
ees. “Trees Hall will function
mostly as a student recreation
facility.” ,

Pitt plans to spend $1.5 rnil—
lion (including $400,000 in plant
funds and $1.1 million incapital
campaign donations) to renovate
the Stephen Foster Memorial.

The work is needed to meet
enrollment growth in the theatre
arts department as well as cur-
rent theatre and building code
standards, Pitt officials said.
Renovations will include instal-
lation of emergency lighting, a
ﬁre alarm and sprinkler system,
new or renovated seating, clean-
ing and painting, new lighting
platforms and upgraded ticket
and concession areas. Mechani-
cal, electrical and plumbing
systems will be renovated as the
budget permits. '

“Until this project is com-
pleted, the Stephen Foster

closed for health and safety
considerations,” trustees were
told. ,

I am certain that there are strategies that can be employed
by universities acting in some instances individually, and in
others collectively, to combat someof the evils he described,
recognizing that the way universities operate reﬂects the values
of the larger society of which they are a part.

In his opening remarks to the audience at the plenary session,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg brieﬂy summarized the founding, 1
development and growth of the University. At one point he
spoke positively of the contributions of the University Senate,-
particularly its committees. At a recent Faculty Assembly"
meeting, Herb Chesler, who chairs the Senate elections
committee, described the difﬁculty the committee ‘encountered
in obtaining candidates for Faculty Assembly. He requested
that the University administration make an effort to impress
on faculty and academic administrators the value of the Senate
and its organs to the University, as a way to encourage faculty
participation. The chancellor’s remarks,.alb_eit to an audience
consisting of very few deans and only a tiny fraction of the
faculty, clearly was strongly supportive of such participation. I

  Bradford gets new scholarship fund

George and Susan Evans of Bradford have
established a new scholarship at Pitt’s Bradford
campus in memory of Michael R. Cavalline.

The Evanses’ gift will be matched by

the Reed-Coit Scholarship Challenge, which

matches any gift totaling at least $1,000 that is

What if the hijackers — outnumbered V

had then aborted their plan to attack
Washington, D.C., and settled for
crashing into thetallest building in

' ”What has been widely overlooked

in the tragedy of Sept. 11, as far as we‘

here at Pitt are concerned, is that there
was an element of luck to the fact
that the plane went down in the wilds
of western Pennsylvania rather than
taking out the Cathedral of Learning,”
says University Professor of Philosophy
Nicholas Rescher, during a recent
interview in his Cathedral of Learning
office.

For thousands of people, Sept. 11

or bad. But humans are at the mercy of
luck every day of their lives, Rescher

lthough she's a professor of law,
APat Chew believes that the legal
system is not always the " best
way to handle disputes. Sometimes

parties in conflict need to look for
‘alternatives that take into ‘account the

cultural differences of the disputants.

”So this bookqreally came about by
making a very simple premise: When
we look at conﬂict, and notjust legal
conflict, but conflict itself, I think
culture matters,” says Chew of her
recent publication, ”The Conﬂict and
Culture Reader” (New York University
Press 2001). A

The book is a collection of essays

on the inter-relationship of conﬂict and V

culture drawn from several academic

-disciplines. The essays describe how

various cultures defifie conﬂict and

f analyze those different perspectives in

the abstract and inspecific case-based
examples. -

”In a way, this is quite contrary
to What some people in the law say,
which isthat culture shouldn't matter,
because to’ consider it starts to dilute
legal principle. If you start to say a legal
principle should vary, or that conﬂict
should be decided differently, or that
we should View the conﬂict differently,
then you're moving away from the

sanctity of the law.”

But bolstered by her pre-law back-
ground in social sciences, Chew says
that merely applying the law to conﬂicts
and relying solely on the court system
forresolution represents too narrow

a viewpoint, even for lawyers-in- ,

training.

argues.

Convinced that modern philoso-
phers have not taken luck as seriously
as the topic demands, Rescher wrote
a book, ”Luck: The Brilliant Random-
ness of Everyday Life,” to redress his
colleagues’ oversight. It was reissued in
paperback last year by the University
of Pittsburgh Press.

Compared with Rescher’s 80-plus
other books, ”Luck” is slim (209 pages
plus appendix, notes and index) and
accessible for non-philosophers. It was
well-received by critics and readers
alikewhen published in hardback in
1995 by Farrar Strauss and Giroux.

Booklist praised it as ”a fascinating
look at an underexplored topic,” while
The New York Times Book Review
called it an ”intelligent effort to bring the
rarified air of philosophical speculation
to bear upon the concerns of everyday
life.”

”Luck” sold 10,000 copies in hard-
cover, 10 times as many as Rescher’s
books usually sell. ”The rest of my

scholars, philosophers today usually
write for each other rather than for the
world at large. But the topic of luck

not to over-generalize, but recognizing
differences and noting that there might
be a richness from that that can build a
legal core with more fairness.” _
In law, the so-called cultural defense
has been almost always rejected by
the courts, Chew says. It is not a valid
defense, for example", that behavior
considered sexual harassment in the
work place under American’ law is

, condoned in other countries, even if the

accused is from such a country.

”In considering the perspectives
about a hostile work environment, one
perspective is the harasser ’s.
’I didn't mean to offend.
I thought it was funny.’
Well, using this perspective
perpetuates the environ-
ment. Most courts use the
’reasonable person's per-
spective,’ which is the pre-
  vailing view. Would a rea-
I  .  sonable person think the

 I  environment is hostile? But
recently some courts started
using a ’reasonable woman's perspec-
tive.’ To the extent that ’a reasonable
woman’ might have a different perspec-
tive than ’a reasonable random person,’
then maybe the outcome would be
different,” Chew says.

Similarly, regarding racial harass-
ment, what a member of a minority
group thinks is offensive or harassing
m"ig'ht be different from the reasonable
person's perspective.

”So we're dealing with ghifting
perspectives. First you ‘say, should we
consider this other culture? Which is

seemed worthwhile to communicate
with a wider audience and publish

”Luck” earned Rescher new readers -

and phone calls from journalists seeking
quotes about such topics as ”the luck
of the Irish” (a favorite angle for St.
Patrick's Day stories) good luck charms
(even the sober-sided Admiral George
Dewey wore alucky rabbit's foot at
the battle of Manila Bay, Rescher notes)
and the role of luck in the careers of
U.S. politicians (an extreme example: An

why I included gender issues in this
book's discussions, because I think
in some ways women live a different
culture than men. There is a lot of
resistance in the legal system to this. But
I think it's worth the risk to consider
these issues, how race, gender and
culture affect the way we deal with and
resolve conﬂict.”
El

Some of the essays in Chew’s reader
discuss particular dispute resolution
processes rather than speciﬁc culture
and conflict resolution issues. At
Pitt, Chew teaches a course in alterna-
tive dispute resolution (ADR), which
nurtures skills in non-litigation contexts.
The popular, but not required, course
encourages law students to look for solu-
tions to conﬂict outside jurisprudence.
ADR employs techniques such as
negotiation, mediation and arbitration,
among others, where the parties in
conﬂict have more control over.the

ground rules than is afforded them in T

the court system.

”The tendency in law school. is to
think the
solution. With that assumption comes a
lot of other assumptions: the perspective
of the parties asadversarial; theidea of

self-interest versus collective interest,"

the law prof says. , .

But ADR offers different assump-
tions, in a moreiinformal and private
setting. ”How should we-resolve this
conﬂict? Do we want to go on the basis
of law, or .on what we think is fair

If ”The Catcher in the Rye," JD.
Salinger ’s 1951 tale of teenage angst,
had appeared a half-century later,
it might well have been marketed as a
young—adult novel, says Pitt professor
emeritus William E. Coles Jr.

By today's standards, ”Catcher”

- bears the genre's earmarks, Coles points

out: Unadorned style. Mild profanity
and sex. A plot that cen_ters around
a journey of self—discovery by an intel-
ligent yet confused young protagonist,
rebelling against the dubious values of
the adult world.

' Not that Coles is a  of ”Catcher”
(its dialogue strikes him as being ”a bit
phony”) but he cites Salinger ’s classic in
arguing that literature aimed at readers
aged 14-and—older has outgrown its
bland beginnings. '

”Today, it's as much a marketing
niche as anything,” Coles says. ”I
wouldn't have written my own young-
adult novels any differently if they-had
been for a general adult readership.”

Coles, who has taught English writ-
ing and literature here since 1974, has
written three young—adult novels. They

chaos, choice and contingency — a
world in which rational foresight can
go only so far,” Rescher writes.

His advice? Act prudently. Don't
push your luck. But don't avoid taking
sensible risks either, out of laziness or

fear of failure. ”You have to give luck a .

chance to help you,” he says.

Humans always have sought to
make life more orderly and predictable
by, among other things, reducing risks
posed by diseases, ﬂoods, fires and
earthquakes. One reason that some
peoples such as the Chinese are more
lucl<—conscious than Americans is that
Chinese have been less successful in
reducing these natural risks, Rescher
suggests.

” We Americans tend to believe, quite
falsely, that we can control all of the
forces that have power over our lives,”
he says. ”But in times of war, even
Americans will do things that appear
to be superstitious attempts to get luck
on our side.”

Too much security takes the fun
out of life, says Rescher, quoting Erich
Fromm’s observation that man is the
only creature capable of being bored.
”We need order and stability,” Rescher
writes, ”but we also need novelty and
innovation to nourish our minds and
spirits.” Luck literally keeps us from
dying of boredom, he says.

  

Monday” (an Ameri-
can Library Associa-
tion Best Book for
Young Adults), and
last year's ”Compass
 - in the Blood,” a mod-
ern-day mystery in
J whichaPitt freshman
 and her friends inves-
 tigate what remains,
probably, the most
bizarre and sensa-
- tional real-life crime
in Pittsburgh history: the Katherine
Soffel scandal.

On Jan. 31, 1902, Kate Soffel, the
34-year-old wife of the warden of the
Allegheny County Jail, aided the escape
of two brothers awaiting execution by
smuggling in saws and guns to them.
Kate apparently had fallen in love with
one of the brothers, handsome young
Ed Biddle. Deserting her husband and
four young children, Kate ﬂed with the
fugitives in a stolen sleigh. The next
day, a posse caught up with them in
Butler County. a

Ed and Jack Biddle were shot and
killed. Kate Soffel also was shot but
survived and was sent to Western
Pennsylvania Penitentiary, where she

' served two years. She then lived under

an assumed name on Pittsburgh's North
Side, working as a dressmaker, until her
death from typhoid fever six years later.

Kate's husband divorced her shortly

after her" capture, and reportedly she
never saw her children again.
As Coles writes, the scandal usually

is told as a love story, ”either the sort 1

that made [Mrs. Soffel] into a pathetic
romantic fool or one that represented
her as a tragic heroine, bravely choosing
to endure the world's scorn to follow
the dictates of her heart.”

But in Coles’s novel, those interpreta-
tions are challenged by Harriet ”Harry”
Bromfield, ”Pittsburgh’s most ﬂamboy-
ant and controversial TV journalist”
(modeled, the author says, after O.J.
Simpson murder trial prosecutor Marcia
Clark, with a touch of the late Patti
Burns thrown in). Harry discovers. that
Mrs. Soffel may have ‘left behind a secret

Luck also is a great leveler. ”Life
being what it is, only talented and hard-
working people can get to be concert
soloists, navy admirals or corporate
C EOs, ” Rescher writes. ”But anyone can
get lucky and win the lottery.”

Luck, he concludes, ”holds out rays
of hope for those whose chances of
actual achievement are slim.” .

Rescher dismisses the possibility that
an interventionist God controls details
of life on-Earth, thereby eliminating
luck. ”When good luck comes our way,
wecanbehappybutwe can’tbe literally
grateful,” he writes. ”There is no one —
and nothing — to be grateful to."

He condemns good-luck charms as
being ”no more than an attempt to
control the uncontrollable” but sees
advantages to putting faith in such
talismans. ”If you’ are a tennis player,
and in big matches you always wear
your lucky shirt, that will make a
difference in your performance because
it will affect your attitude,” Rescher
says. ”You’re going to have that added
bit of confidence. There are lots of
performance kinds of things where
confidence makes all the difference in
the world, and feeling that luck is on
your side is going to enhance your
performance. ‘

”On the other hand, if somebody
steals your lucky shirt you're going to
fret about it, and you probably won't

play your best game.”

Rescher dedicated ”Luck” to his

 

diary revealing the sensational, untold
true story of the escape. Harry enlists
Pitt journalism student Dee Armstrong
as a go-fer, promising her an internship
and a bright future in TV news if Dee
helps to track down the diary.

Dee's quest takes her from Oakland
to Downtown, Shadyside, the South
Side, Troy Hill and ﬁnally to a Squirrel
Hill cemetery where Kate Soffel’s
cremated remains lie in an unmarked
grave, together (according to the novel)

with her diary. Along the way, Dee’

learns hard lessons about loyalty,
betrayal, ambition and the futility —
and danger — of trying to fit people into
neat categories based on age, sexuality
or superﬁcial charm.

As the novel progresses, Kate -Soffel
comes to personify human complexity.
”She’s like Jay Gatsby,” Coles suggests,
”in the sense that people can project
any identity they want on her: foolish
middle-aged wife, feminist -victim,

- depraved monster of adultery and

parental neglect.” Harry sees Mrs. Soffel
simply as a wronged woman. But Dee,
struggling to come to terms with her
parents’ divorce, is troubled by Kate's
abandonment of her children.

Coles believes Kate Soffel was
considerably more complicated than she
has been portrayed in print (Pittsburgh
-newspapers in 1902 published cartoons
depicting her as a sewer-dwelling
vampire and a devourer of children),
on stage (in hisresearch, Coles found
references to a 1903 melodrama based
on the Soffel-Biddle story) and on ﬁlm
(unlike many critics and’ historians,
Coles liked Gillian Armstrong's 1984
movie, ”Mrs. Soffel,”a gloomy, feminist
version of the story shot at the Allegheny
County Jail and other local sites).

Just as his novel condemns pigeon-

K holins of.h;1manbeings, ,.C_o.1es,..r.esf1gt$,

literarywdogma such as: "An old 

like him shouldn't be writing from the _

viewpoint of a young woman.
”Actually, of the five novels I've
written, four were written from the
point of view of a young woman,” he
notes. ”I keep waiting‘ for feminist criti-

cism', some bullshit like ’You’e  

wife: ”For Dorothy, my own bit of good

luck.” Dorothy, he explains, began

working at Pitt in the development

office. But, following personnel changes .
there, she transferred to philosophy,

where a job had just opened up. ”All of

this created the opportunity for us to
meet,” Rescher recalls. ”In this society,

people don't tend to ﬁnd each other

through matchmakers. It's usually ‘a

matter of luck, simply being in the right
place at the right time.” ' ‘ '

Rescher believes his luck began
before he was born. During World War
1, his father fought in the German’ army
on the western front. ”Of my father's
high school class of about 80 students,
fewer than 20 survived the war. My
father didn't do anything signiﬁcantly
different than his classmates. Obviously,
if he. hadn't survived, I wouldn't be
here today.”

When Rescher (who was 9 when his
family immigrated to America) finished
his Ph.D..and was drafted into the U.S.
military during the Korean War, he
expected to serve in this country as "an
Army researcher, a job arranged for him
by one of his Princeton professors.
”But at that time the Marines, this
proud volunteer force, were building
up very fast and couldn't get enough
volunteers, so they had to resort to
the draft,” Rescher says. ”By lottery,
every ﬁfth draftee was assigned to the
Marines.” '

Rescher was among the one-in—five

   

to appropriate the female experience,’
but so far no one has complained.
”To me, writing from the viewpoint

of someone who is different from you,

in terms of age, gender or race is like
learning to draw by looking at your
subject in a mirror, or a right-handed
person drawing with the left hand. The
exercise opens up your creativity by
dislocating you from your familiar way
of looking at the world.” .

”Compass in the Blood” offers a
highly unfamiliar, mirror—image look at
the Soffel-Biddle story: as aconspiracy
in which county jail warden Peter Soffel
set up the condemned brothers and
his own wife.

Coles points out that:

0 Priorto the jailbreak, Warden Soffel
encouraged his wife to continue visiting
the Biddles on death row, ostensibly to
comfort them spiritually — even though

‘such visits violated prison regulations

and had been criticized by Pittsburgh

. newspapers.

0 The only way out of the maximum-
security area where the Biddles were
imprisoned was ”throughan iron door

that could be opened only from the
. outside or with a key from within; it

was strictly forbidden for thatkey to be
brought into the prison proper under

_ any circumstances,” Coles writes. ”Yet

the night of the escape one of the guards
did bring in the key, which the Biddles
stole when they overpowered him.”

0 None of the three guards on duty
the night the Biddles escaped activated
the jail’s new electric alarm system
”though all the guarélshad been made
familiar with its operation, and though
the button to set it off was conspicuous
in the guardroom,” Coles writes. 1

0 The Biddles were only technically A

murderers (they were sentenced to

..death. for .participating in a robbery

during" which an'tacco”rnplic"e l<illed"a
local druggist) but they were savvy,
career criminals. They planned their
escape for months, and had sawed
through their cell bars days before the
actual breakout. Why did the Biddles
choose to escape at 3 a.m. on Jan. 31,

draftees sent to Parris Island for Marine
' basic training. But, in yet another

reversalof luck, he ended up being
assigned stateside, ”to keep the North
Koreans out of Washington, D .C ., rather
than out of South Korea,” as he self-
mockingly puts it.

Discharged in the early 1950s —

”when, in an example of unlucky _
timing, the academic job market was 1

as bad as it has ever been in American
history,” Rescher points out — he took

-a job with the Rand Corp. ”Through

sheer luck, the man who ran the job
placement service for philosophers
pulled my card from a big file of
candidates.” Rescher took apay cut to
begin his academic career at Lehigh
University. .
Rescher rejects the ancient Greek
view” of humans as masters of their
own fates. _
”But the Stoics had a point,” he allows
in his book. ”We are to ‘a considerable

extent the masters of our own spirit and 4

personality —— controllers‘ not of what

happens to us but of what we allow

good luck and bad luck and fortune

to do to us. We arenot masters of-our

circumstancestbut we are — or should‘
be — mastersvof ourselves.

- "How the world treats us lies largely
beyond our control. But how we deserve
to be treated is something that, in the
final analysis, lies wholly within our
power.”

Ph.D. through Pitt’ 
rhetoric of scienc
p ogram, went to Eng
land for seven years as
assistant professor at the University of
London - Imperial College, and came

”back to ‘Pitt as a faculty member this

January with a controversial journal
in tow.

Leach is executive editor of Social
Epistemology: Ajournal of Knowledge,
Culture and Policy (Taylor and Francis
Ltd.), which now is housed in Pitt's

’ Department of Communication.

Leach says the -. quarterly journal
departs from custom in several respects,
including being international, multi-
disciplinary and open-debate oriented,
often exposing clashes among academi-
cians bent on ‘defending their disci-
plines.

The journal is now in its 15th year;

- Leachhas been  5
She says she weeded ‘out about half of '

the editorial board she inherited because
its leanings were too American.

"I have_a real commitment to*inter-
national publication, to move away
from strictly American academics,
which can be quite parochial,” Leach
says. "Being in England brought that

' to‘ the fore for me."

A recent edition (Vol. 15 No. 3 July-
September 2001), which focuses on

    

the theme: social epistemology and
knowledge management, demonstrates
that commitment. Scholarly submis-
sions come from Spain, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, Australia and the
United States, and include academicians
in business-, sociology, philosophy and
communication. A

"Social epistemology is how knowl-
edge is produced and circulated in
different social communities. It's sup-
posed to be of interest to different
disciplines,” Leach says. "But that's

been tremendously controversial.

"The term epistemology
comes out of philosophy,
although, interestingly, the
term social epistemology
was actually coined by a
librarian. Something as basic
as the concept 'knowledge'
— philosophers talk about it
in completely different terms
from the terminology they
use at business schools. So
even though themes are con-
ceptual, the way we talk
about them doesn't have to
be in the idiom of philosophy.”

Leach says that essays in the journal
have sometimes stimulated the kind
of turf wars that academic disciplines
undertake. A. good example, she says,
was an issue of the journal on the theme
"the idea of the university.”

"I expected it to be controversial and
political, and it was, but I was surprised
at the stake different disciplines have
in seeing the university in a particular
way. For example, there was a strong
response by social scientists, who see
the university as providing a particular
kind of structure.

"Here inhumanities, We're all typing

‘ away in our office at our computers,

but in the social sciences they have

have group techniquhesfso even one’s
conception of the university is in a way
underwritten by peculiar philosophical
commitments. There are vested interests
in funding decisions, the concept of
a department, or a research group,

or defining what exactly» is the unit"

producing knowledge. ' -

"But this can be a productive ten-

sion,” she hastens to add. "As academics
we have few places to talk about these

things. We can argue about it as a
political phenomenon at a University
Senate meeting, or it might come out
in the London Times higher education
supplement or The Chronicle of Higher
Education here as a topic area, but there
is no place to study that academically.
And that's what I'd like the journal
to be: a place to have a debate, a
dialogue about knowledge and how it's
distributed, and not just politics.'’

In addition to teaching full-time
and doing research, Leach coordinates
journal correspondence from her long,
narrow temporary office in the Cathe-
dral of Learning, which she has dubbed
the "bowling alley.” -

"It is very time-consuming work,"
she says. "You're always kind of doing
it. And there are publisher's deadlines
and schedules to meet, so there is time
pressure. But I enjoy it. I enjoy working
with authors. And it helps me keep up
to date on the field.”

Leach counts on her collaboration
with the journal's founding editor,
Steve Fuller, professor of sociology at
the University. of Warwick, who taught
at Pitt for a year and helped Leach ﬁnish
her Ph.D. here. "We don't always agree,
but it's friendly disagreement, and I
rely on his advice quite a bit.”

Leach says her experience with
the journal informs her teaching as
well. "I find myself mentioning to
undergraduate students: 'One question

a researcher might. ask here is....’ And ,

for graduate students, I can give them
a feel for what areas people are now
doing work in, where I'm getting a
lot of submissions from, what's going
on out there.” ._ﬁ

Teaching students about the publish-
ing process, including peer reviews and
how an editor coordinates criticisms
between reviewers and authors, also

 .V,. u;a.l9.le....s.l1.e.:.. _,e§pe.c...ia11y,_. ,.f.o..r

stu ents who wish to pursue academic
careers. '

While some issues of the journal
focus on particular themes, more typical
are editions with a “variety of formats.

"I like to have three or four articles
that have been through the peer-review
process, but I like to include other
things. Sometimes book reviews, for
example, though not as a high priority.

I like to do a synthesis or a dialogue

between two academicians arguing
out a thorny issue, maybe with two or
three exchanges. Or we'll publish one
paper and publish maybe four people
reviewing that paper in the same issue,”

’ something she says is not typical for

journals.

"Actually, it's radical and crazy
she says. "Most peer reviewing is one-
sided argument: The reviewers are
anonymous to the author, the forms

ll!

' are mostly unsigned, the authors aren't

allowed to directly respond.”
On the other hand, simultaneously

publishing a paper and by-lined reviews '

may reveal biases of reviewers sup-
porting their own disciplines, or may
show simply that reviewers are writing
at cross-purposes or using different
terminology from the author of the
reviewed paper.

"There is a body of literature that
critiques the peer review process and a
movement to make that process more
open, to make it dialogue instead of a
judgment rendered," Leach says. "In_
science, it's been suggested opening up
the review process to stakeholders who
are not necessarily fellow scientists, like
environmentalists, for example.”

Feminists authors, independent
of discipline, have complained that
editorial boards and peer reviewers are
predominantly men, she adds.

In a journal on social epistemology,
expanding the traditional journal format
is fair game, Leach points out. "One of
the things'we're doing in the journal is
producing and distributing knowledge,
so to reﬂect on that a bit in our own
format we thought was incredibly
important.”

Will there ever be a department of
social epistemology?

"I would hate that if it happened,
because then we become just another

<,1€paI.f.I.I.1.<.?I.1L,.1iI1.$.ts*;£1£i.... of. .23. spot .f.0.r.rea1._,

communication and synthesis and
debate and dialogue, and then we'd
probably come up with our own esoteric
jargon,” Leach reasons. .

"That's why I'm in the communica-
tion department, because the people
here are committed to understanding
debate, dialogue, that kind of thing, so
in a sense they're intellectually friendly
to what the journal is trying’ to do."

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 8 V . A

1902 - the coldest night of the coldest
recorded winter in Pittsburgh up to that
time, with a snowstorm predicted to be
on the way — lacking warm clothes,
money or any apparent plan for leaving
the city or staying overnight with one
of their many local friends? Why did
they stop by the warden's residence to
pick up Kate before they escaped, and
why did the conspicuous threesome

then travel aimlessly around the city
- together rather than splitting up?

"To me," Coles says, "it looks as
if they had a plan which was aborted
in some way.”_ ‘ I ‘

’ Coles's novel suggests that Warden
Soffel himself masterminded the escape,
supplying the Biddles ‘(through the
trusting Kate) with cheap, inaccurate
pistols and then letting them get away
— before springing his trap. But why?

Through his marriage to Kate, Soffel
was connected to the Republican Party
machine that controlled Pittsburgh
politics. Yet, he'd only been given
a minor appointment as county jail
warden. Coles says his research indi-
cated that Warden Soffel was calculat-
ing, priggish, possibly sadistic toward
prisoners, a dissatisfied husband, a
crack shot and very ambitious.

"So," Coles says, "what if the warden
sets things up to look as if these desper-

  William Coles  

ate criminals, the Biddles, have taken
his wife hostage and are ﬂeeing north?

Then, in a gun battle,-he drops them .

both. But alas, his wife also iskilled.
Overnight, he would simultaneously
be a hero deserving of higher office and
a bereaved widower. He would also
inherit Kate's considerable property,
which court records show he'd made
her sign over to him, and he would get
to raise their four kids exactly the way
he thought they ought to be raised.

"I'm not saying that really hap-
pened,” Coles emphasizes, laughing.
"But it ﬁts all the facts."

No one knows who ﬁred the bullet
that struck Kate Soffel just above her
heart. (Her steel-ribbed corset probably
saved her life.) Did the dying Ed
Biddle shoot-Kate at her request, as is
commonly assumed, when capture and
shame seemed inevitable? Or was Kate
shot by a member of the posse?

"Certainly, it's strange that the
first thing Peter Soffel did when he
discovered his wife and the Biddles
were gone from the jail was to have the
Biddles’ cells cleaned," Coles continues.
"Everything in those cells, Soffel took
and burned. He also burned his wife's
papers and effects because, he said, he
didn't want his kids to be contaminated
by them.” . ,

But the warden missed at least one of
Kate's papers. Following publication of
"Compass in the Blood," an anonymous
reader mailed Coles a tattered letter,
written in pencil.

\ A historian subsequently conﬁrmed
that the letter was a love note from Ed
Biddle to Kate, the only one known to
exist. The letter is "only about 85 percent
readable," according to Coles, who
donated it to the Butler Library.

"In this letter, Ed pleads with Kate to
help get him and his brother out of jail,"
says Coles. "If she can't do this, she is
to provide him with poison because he
and his brother are determined they're
not going to die on the gallows. Ed tells
her specifically to get. . .but I couldn't
make out the next word. The word
looked like it was spelled 'ruffonrats."’
Colesdiscovered that ‘Ruff on Rats’ was
the trade name of a popular, arsenic-
based rat poison of the day."

_ While sifting through crumbling
files in city and county offices, Coles
found what one of his novel's characters
describes as "a picture of a very regal-
looking, dark-haired woman with sad,
compassionate eyes": 34-year-old Kate
Soffel. Coles compared this photograph
with the portrait of Kate that Pittsburgh
newspapers published in 1902. He
found that, by retouching the original,
the newspapers had made Kate appear
to be a dowdy, dull-eyed matron. "It
fit with the image the media were

promoting of her as a foolish, unfaithful

wife,” Coles says.
Coles's heroine, Dee, follows in the

_author’s-footsteps when she discovers

that — per Kate Soffel’s instructions
— Kate's remains were cremated at
H. Samson,‘ Inc., in Oakland. (In his
research, Coles found that H. Samson
was one of two funeral homes east of

the Mississippi that were performing

cremations in 1902.) Following crema-
tion, Kate's ashes were buried in her
mother's unmarked grave.

In "Compass in the Blood," the
search for that grave sends Dee (as it
sent Coles) tocemeteries in Troy Hill
and Squirrel Hill. At last, the grave is
found. . .but here, for once in the novel,
Coles scrambles local geography.

-In‘ an author's note, he states that
Kate Soffel "did not want her ﬁnal
resting place marked or known. Indeed,
in spite of looking for her grave for
months, I found it only with the help

of information from a source I am '

pledged not to reveal, and then by
sheer accident. It is an accident I have
done my best to make sure will never
happen again.”

Okay, but what about Kate Soffel’s

-secret (and purely fictitious) diary?

"Compass" ends before Dee and her
friends dig for it. Do they ﬁnd it?

Coles answers that question without
hesitation. "That will be revealed in the
sequel," he says, "which I'm currently
ﬁnishing." . - s

mathematics and academic law have
beenand always will be the fields
of the man. It is neither accident nor
conspiracy that women have always
been homemakers, nor is it male
arrogance to say that that is their proper

was spelling out the accepted Catholic
position in post-World War II America,
one of 120 revealing documents in
a new volume of primary sources
titled ”Gender Identities in American
Catholicism” (Orbis Books, 2001).

Volume 5 of a 9-volume documentary
history series on American Catholic
issues, this compilation of essays,
correspondence and reports covers 200
years of archival material.

”Gender Identities” focuses on the
ever-changing social construction « of
masculinity and femininity (as opposed
to the biological term ”sex”) and
the social relations between Catholic
men and women, including the rules,
ideologies and institutions that deﬁne,
regulate and enforce what it means to
be a man or a woman.

Paula Kane, Marous Professor of

Catholic Studies at Pitt, collaborated

in compiling and editing the docu-
ments with James Kenneally, professor
emeritus of history at Stonehill College,
Massachusetts, and Karen Kennelly,

superior general of the Sisters of St.’

Joseph of Carondelet. .

The two—and-a-half—year project
produced some curiosities, some unex-
pected tussles with the publisher
and some discouraging philosophical
pronouncements, such as Wi1lock’s,
Kane said.

”I think the most discouraging
documents were some of those from

I the 19405 and 505 where men are giving

advice,” Kane said. ”There’s an air of
such certitude that these Catholic men
put out there about what was a male
role, what was a female role and how
the two should not get mixed up."

Kane pointed out, however, that
Catholics were right in step with the
majority of post-World War 11 America
in embracing Willock’s version of male
and female roles.

”Attitudes about sex and sexual
behavior and sexual identity have

‘I8

changed throughout the centuries and
they always reﬂect the culture in which
the religion is installed," Kane said.
”In our time, we're growing more
comfortable with men and women
taking on roles traditionally of the
opposite sex’s domain, but we're also
experiencing a certain amount of gender
confusion in our identities, a certain
amount of androgyny, of questioning
what it is to be masculine or feminine,
and I think that's a good thing. It's a
revolution that's still underway.

”It was fun for us to see opinions
changing from the 18th century to the
present, but it was important to show
how difficult it has been to introduce
change, and how‘ people who have been
radical have come under such heavy
critique from the Catholic hierarchy.”

Kane said that not one document
among the hundreds the editors perused

was classiﬁed under ”gender.” ”When .

we were gathering material from
archives around the country, which
varied from well-organized topapers

tossed in a shoebox, we had to discern _

what about a town or a religious order
or a region of the country would have
been about gender: If Mother Jones
came here and riled‘ up the minors and
was roundly lambasted by the press for
being a woman speaking publicly, we
had to know that in advance in order
to focus our research.” .

The publishing process was not a
smooth one, Kane maintained. The
editors met with resistance from Orbis
Books when they decided to publish
excerpts from a 1982 report on Catholic
gays and lesbians in San Francisco. The
diocese’s archbishop at that time, John
R. Quinn, had published a pastoral letter
in response to the report, which Orbis
insisted be included in the book.

 
 

available to Catholics, that of the
hierarchy or official Church, ‘and we
represent voices that-might not other-
wise get into print. The compromise was
we could have the report but we had
to introduce the archbishop.’s official
statement on homosexuality.”

Kane said that the more contempo-
rary the material, the stronger the
objections the Orbis Books board
registered.

”They wanted us to take out a lot of
documents,‘which we refused to do. We

advising us? Do we want an arbitrator
whose decision is binding, or a'mediator
who can only advise us? Do we want to
say everybody can talk for 10 minutes,
or’ do we want to meet over a beer
and talk all we want? There are no
fixed rules.

”If I drove into. your car, the legal
solution would start going down a track
of torts and personal injury; in ADR
you're not limited to that. Litigation
usually is premised on the idea that one
party wins and one party loses. ADR
is premised on the idea —— at least in
theory — that both parties can reach a
satisfactory solution.

”Say it turns out the two parties in
a dispute are neighbors. Shouldn't the
solution take that into account? The
legal principles would not take that
into account. So ADR has very different
presumptions and is a fundamentally
different approach.”

‘Once considered as competition
for the traditional legal process, ADR
increasingly is viewed as a relevant skill
for lawyers. ’’In the last 20-25 years,
ADR has become a mainstream offering
at law schools. Will it ever replace the

kept saying, ’What is it you're fearing? _
We're historians not theologians, and
people should be able to look at this
material and see that the American
Catholic Church was quite divisive in

the late—20th and early-21st century, and -

there are a whole range of issues that
got people riled up and those should
be accessible.”’

But Orbis, a Catholic press head-
quartered in New York, evidently
feared reprisals from the American
Catholic hierarchy, Kane said, leading
to a number of arguments. ”I think you
become very aware of the long arm
of institutional power every time you
study Catholicism, that people who
get too far out of line do face severe
consequences. V

”Even in Pittsburgh, the bishop's
solution to the recent revelations of"
sexualabuse is not to talk to priests about
psychological counseling, it was to say,
’Well, we're getting rid of anybody
who may have had a complaint leveled
against them.’ That's no way to operate.
It's very strange,” Kane said. _

”And you know these moments
remind you of a throwback to a much
more feudal power structure. I would
say the Church's power is tremendously
diminished, but many of" the leaders
don't know how to deal with that new
status quo and are still trying to operate
by the old rules.” -

Kane said most of the documents in
”Gender Identities” reveal the repres-
sive nature of the male-dominated
American Catholic Church. ”For us
it was important to present evidence

‘ that nuns were treated as second-class

citizens, were paid far less than male
counterparts, had to ﬁght for every
dollar they got from their local dioceses

‘ even to pay for their clothing, their
V firewood or their utilities, and that was
 ' ' ‘ T as-an-issueeof-equity.’{~;e 

Still, she pointed out, there is consid-
erable evidence among the documents
that even within this patriarchalsociety,
men and women did find creative ways
to get around the rules or in fact to

' actually resist authority.‘

”Yes, there were rules and regulations

, to keep nuns in their place, mothers in

their place, school girls in their place.
And there were also confining rules for
men: Every man inside a priestly order
operates in a hierarchy of power as well.
So there were humiliations along the

”On the other hand, we found many
examples of collaboration between men
and women, the often very affectionate

‘relationship between nuns and the
parish priests who were confessors in
their convent. The nuns were willing to
tell the "priests all their troubles, personal
as well as spiritual, and clearly there
was a lot of respect, even friendship.
And when you consider that these were
celibate groups, that was the only place
where you could have a friendship with
someone of the opposite sex. These
documents I found to be the most

heartening.” V

Kane said she and her editor col-
leagues hope that "one outcome of
”Gender Identities” willbe to encourage
students to use substantially underused
Catholic archival resources.

”Twenty-year-old Catholics have
no knowledge of the institutional
apparatus, so they don't perceive the
intuition as one thing or another, they're
just apolitical. They don't recognize that
they come upon things from a guilt-free
perspective, unlike my generation and
my parents beforeme.”

That lack of historical perspective has
paved the way for anAmerican Catholic
Church resurrecting its conservative
past, Kane said.

”We’re seeing that among a lot of
young married Catholics: They're going
back to church with their babies in their
strollers, saying, _’Isn’ t this interesting:
novenas, rosary devotions?’ They're
bringing back a raft of things that -were
never central to Catholic belief, but now
they're" making ‘themcentral as a way
to latch on to some identity. » .

”I feel discouraged that the whole

tradition of social activism is being I

suppressed by the Vatican in its attempt
to simply make a very conformist
institution defined by very narrow

standards. It _frigl_’itens_ me that the ~

wonderful liberalizing spirit of Vatican

.. II has never been fully implemented
‘and is now threatened to disappear by

a generation that knows nothing about
what Vatican II changed.

”The good part is that Catholics are
more tolerant. The bad" part is. they
don't know there is a whole history of
intolerance that they should be aware

’ of. I keep telling my students this: If

the’ Catholic Church wants _a leaner,
meaner institution, that's exactly what
it's going to get.” ‘ .

way for both genders,” Kane said.

regular legal education? Absolutely
not. But viewing ADR as a legitimate '
alternative is real and is current.”

In fact, some states are considering
regulations making it mandatory for”
lawyers to advise clients of the avail-
ability of ADR, Chew points out.

”I think the presumption is that
lawyers are experts on the law and
maybe can consult on other things.
I think a lot of lawyers in practice
eventually come to think of themselves
as problem—solvers and advisers to their
clients in ways that go beyond the law.
I like that concept of lawyers, helping
clients deﬁne the problem and then
helping the client create a solution that
works for the client, even when it may’
not be a legal solution. If a lawyer
assumes the legal solution is the only
one, I think that's a disservice to the
client.”

Ironically, it was while teaching her
ADR class last fall that the news broke
about the terrorist attacks on New York
and Washington. After a few shock-
ﬁlled days, she tried to re-focus the
class on the topic. ”There was a lot
of resistance to talking about ADR in

this context, because their instincts
were saying; ’Let’s bomb the hell out of
them.’ And it's understandable. ‘

”I’m not so much questioning that .

response, but I’m— questioning if we
understand why we made that response.
And that's how I get back to trying to
understand the cultural question, why
theterrorists did what they did and

continue to do what they do. I

_ ”It’s. difficult for Americans to
understand; it's even unpleasant for
us to try to understand. But to merely
say, we can't understand, it's foreign,
it's not explainable, it's inhuman, does
nobody any good. A ' 

”I hope that we honor the humanness
of the terrorists — I realize that's a hard
view to take — but at some level we
have to try tounderstand the human
motivations that prompted their actions.
My assumption is that there are cultural
explanations for those motivations,

whether religious or political or what-

ever, and my main reason for trying to
understand their motivations, not to
justify them, is really to prevent other

RESEARCH NOTES

Common
treatment for
endometriosis
linked to
ovarian cancer
A commonly prescribed med-
ication for treating endometriosis
appears to increase the risk of
ovarian cancer, according to

ﬁndings presented recently by a »

Pitt Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH) researcher at
the 33rd annual meetinglof the
Society of Gynecologic Oncolo-
gists in Miami.

In the study, women taking
danazol, a synthetic version of
the male hormone androgen,
were nearly three times more
likely to develop ovarian cancer
than were women taking leu-
prolide, an anti—androgenic,
gonadotropin—releasing hor-

mone agonist. Both drugs are .

used to treat endometriosis, a
painful disease in which pieces
of uterine tissue migrate to other
parts of the body.

“Our previous studies have
found that women with endo-
metriosis are already at a 50
percent increased risk for ovar-
ian cancer, and treating. them
with danazol appears to further
increase their risk. This new

, result, even though it is prelimi-

nary, may factor into the equa-
tion when clinicians and their
patients with endometriosis are

. deciding on thebest treatment,”

said presenter Roberta B. Ness,
associate professor of epidemiol-

ogy at GSPH and director of
the school’s Epidemiology of

V .“Worrfeﬁ’s Health ‘Program: *~ "

The study analyzed pooled
data from two case-control stud-
ies that examined the relation-

. ships among endometriosis,

endometriosis treatments and
ovarian cancer. Among women
with endometriosis, 17 took

, danazol and 15 took leuprolide.

Analysis showed that the study
participants who took danazol
were 2.7 times more likely to have
ovarian cancer than were other
women with endometriosis who
did not take danazol. Women
taking leuprolide had no signiﬁ-
cant elevation in risk

“While the number ofwomen
studied is small, the results are
telling, and they warrant further
studies on a larger scale,” said

I the study’s principal investiga-
tor, Carrie Cottreau, assistant

professor of obstetrics and gyne-
cology at Pitt’s School of Medi-
cine. ~
Additional research studies
are planned at Pitt to further
investigate the link between
androgens and ovarian cancer.
Earlier this year, Ness and
colleagues published results
of a study showing that there
is no association between fertil-
ity drugs and ovarian cancer.
However, the study showed that
the.risk of ovarian cancer is
50 percent higher in women
with endometriosis than it is for
womenwithout endometriosis.

Sacks’ group is studying the

The_challenge, Sacks says, is
developing a thorough under-

standing of structure and func-
tion so replacement tissues can -

reach optimal efﬁciency. For
example, ‘no one has yet been
able to build a replacement
heart valve that can match the
performance of a natural aortic
valve, which functions to prevent
blood from ﬂowing backward
from the aorta ,to the left ven-
tricle.

The natural valve represents a
masterful interaction of ﬂuid and
solid tissue, and can withstanding
as many as 40 million cycles a
year — up to three billion or

more in a lifetime. Current tissue .

engineering materials, including

biodegradable polymer scaffolds,
require much more work in
order to provide both structure

Repairing liver

Repairing liver disease or
damage may become easier
thanks to research being under-
taken by George Michalopou-
lous, professor and chairman of
the pathology department, and
his colleagues.

They are studyingways to use
differentiated liver cells, called
hepatocytes, to reconstruct liver
tissue. Using several cell growth
factors, liver cells were encour-
aged to proliferate in culture.
After eight days, tissue growth
was sufﬁcient to cover the surface
of the culture.

Examination showed that the
cultured tissue displayed patterns
of cell division and cell death
similar to the natural growth
cycle. In addition, layers of
differentiated liver cells were
observed, including connective
tissue, bile ducts and other cells
that would naturally be associ-
ated with blood vessels within
the liver.

These experiments could lead
to further understanding of ways

to use such engineered liver

tissue to repair liver damage

and ‘disease.

Healing ofcommon sports injury

Healing of a common sports
injury may be significantly
improved by using a tissue-
engineered scaffold made of
cellular components found in
the small intestine, reports
Volker Musahl, a fellow in
the Musculoskeletal Research
Center.

Musahl presented ﬁndings of
a study using elements of small
intestinal submucosa, or SIS,
to boost healing of injuries to
the knee joint’s medial collateral
ligament (MCL). A common
sports injury, MCL tears account
for some 40,000 injuries a year
in the United States. Most such
injuries can be treated without
surgery, but the healed ligament
remains weak and is susceptible
to re—injury. —

Usingarabbitmodel,Musahl
and his colleagues used a tissue-
engineered scaffold made up
of SIS, a collagen layer in the
small bowel that already has been
approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration for clinical
use in vascular surgery, urology
and some orthopaedic cases.
After 12 weeks ofthealing, the
ligament tissue was carefully
examined for strength and qual-
ity. Both strength and quality
were doubled when compared

Research
suggests genes
for depression
differ in

men, women

Pitt researchers have found ,

evidence that men and women
have different genes that anchor
the roots of depression, a revela-
tion that could have a major
impact on the way doctors treat
patients in the future.

The researchers are the first to
report the results of a systematic
search for chromosomal regions
that harbor genes that affect
susceptibility to severe depres-
sion, the second leading cause
of disability worldwide. Their
results were published in the
April Americanjournal of Medi-
cal Genetics, and posted on the
journal’s Web site.

“We suspected there were
at least ajew different genes
involvediin making women
and men susceptible to major
depression,” said lead author
George S. Zubenko, professor
of psychiatry at Pitt’s School of
Medicine and adjunct professor
of biological sciences at Carnegie
Mellon University.

“The results of this study
suggest that sex—speciﬁc genes

for recurrent major depression
may actually be the rule rather
than the exception.”

For the study, funded by the
National Institute of Mental
Health, Zubenko and his col-
leagues compared genetic mark-
ers from 100 men and women
with recurrent, early-onset major
depressive disorder (RE-MDD)
and 100 people with no history
of this disorder, to ﬁnd out
which chromosomal regions
were associated with the illness.
RE—MDD is a severe form of
clinical depression that runs

in families and impairs the
health and life span of family
members.

Out of 19 chromosomal
regions that were associated with
the development of RE—MDD,
16 were signiﬁcantly associated
with the disorder in either men
or women — but not both.

. According to Zubenko, these
ﬁndings suggest important dif-
ferences in the molecular basis
of clinical depression in men and
women, or sex-speciﬁc differ-
ences that determine resistance
to stressful events. These genetic

factors also may contribute to
differences in the symptoms of
clinical depression in men and
women, differential treatment
responses, and the development
of additional psychiatric disor-
ders such as anxiety disorders,
alcoholism and other substance
use disorders that frequently
accompany major depression and
run in the same families.
Zubenko said this research
may provide an important step
toward changing the way doc-
tors diagnose and treat major
depression, which affects nearly

“Studies such as this one
are providing us with a better
understanding of the biology
of complicated disorders such
as major depression, which is
unlikely to represent a single
disease with a unitary cause,”

Zubenko said. “Instead, clinical ‘

depression is probably more like
anemia. Both of these disorders
are deﬁned by a collection of
clinical features that result from
different causes in different
people. Treatment or prevention

ported by the National Science
Foundation.

“Cells of the body ‘talk’
directly to one another,” Prentice
said. “By understanding the
language of this communication,
future studies will allow us
to control cell behavior, for

example, to stop cancer cells
from growing and spreading

throughout the body.”

Chancellor Mark A. Nor-
denberg presented the sixth
Global Peace Award of the
International Amateur Athletic
Association (IAAA) March 27 to
Rudolph Giuliani, former mayor
of New York City. a

The Global Peace Award
was established in 1993 initially
in. honor" of Olympic great
Jesse Owens and to recognize
individuals who best personify
Owens’s humanitarian spirit. It
is awarded to a person who “has
made a signiﬁcant and lasting
contribution of enduring quality
to peace” and who “has shown
distinguished leadership through
personal example of work, deeds,
or written and spoken state-
ments.” “ I

Nordenberg chaired the

award selection committee.

Joan M._Lakoski has been
named assistant vice chancellor
for academic career development
for the newly established Ofﬁce
of Academic Career Develop-
ment. . , - .

The ofﬁce has been created

I by the Schools of the Health

Sciences to establish, evaluate
and sustain initiatives that will
enhance the recruitment, reten-
tion and- academicsuccess of
biomedical scientists at Pitt. The
focus of the ofﬁce will be_ on
addressing the career develop:
ment and advancement needs

‘ of all biomedical researchers

from undergraduate students
to postdoctoral fellows and
scholars, as well as junior and
senior faculty.

The ofﬁce, which is believed
to be the ﬁrst of its kind in the
United States, also will provide
support for diverse populations
in the biomedical research com‘-
munity, including the provision
of opportunities for the engage—.
ment of women and minorities as
leaders in biomedical research.

Lakoski will join the Univer-
sity’s faculty in July 2002 from
Penn State College of Medicine,
where sheis interim chair of the
Department of Pharmacology
and professor of pharmacology
and anesthesiology.

She has received numerous
professional honors, including
appointment as a Committee
of Institutional Cooperation
Academic Leadership Fellow
and an administrative fellow at
Penn State.

She has served-as co-chair
of a committee on postdoctoral
fellows at Penn State College
of Medicine and has ‘pursued
long—term interests in the area
of professional development,
research ethics, responsible
conduct in science and the
enhancement of postdoctoral
education. '

Lakoski helped to organize

and administer a nationwide,
informal survey to learn about
administrative structures that
exist for postdoctoral students
across the country.

Results showed that many
institutions lacked the organi-
zational infrastructure to sup-
port postdocs and handle their
affairs.

“The academic community
is finally realizing that we need
to better support our faculty,”
Lalcoski said. “By developing
the Ofﬁce of Academic Career
Development, the University of
Pittsburgh has positioned itself
not only to become a leader in
emerging ﬁelds of biomedical
research but also to become the
best place to go if you want to
develop a career in research and if
you want that career to ﬂourish.
I am excited and honored to lead
this office.”

In addition to her duties as

‘ assistant vice chancellor, Lakoski

will continue her federally funded
research in neuropharmacology
and neuroendocrinology of aging
as a professor of pharmacology.

universities in bringing national
attention to alcohol and other
drug prevention on college and

university campuses. President’s
Leadership Group members also
will serve to further statewide
and regional alcohol and drug
prevention efforts, with members
adopting leadership roles in
existing regional initiatives or
taking the lead in states where
statewide efforts have not yet
taken hold. '
Pitt-Greensburg won a grant
from the Pennsylvania Liquor
Control Board in 1999 to estab-
lish a campus—community coali-

cally address alcohol abuse
and consumption among young
people in the community.
