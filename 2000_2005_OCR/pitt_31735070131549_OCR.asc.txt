Meetingraises questions about board makeup

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Meetings of Pitt’s board of trustees often
attracttconcerned activists, such as the protesters
who greeted trustees outside last year’s meeting
with complaints about the lack of a living wage
and same—sex benefits at Pitt.

Rarely do concerns about sensitive issues
come from trustees during the open board meet-
ing itself. When trustee Catherine DeAngelis
pointed out the absence of any women among six
re-elected executive committee members, she
broke the trend.

All 10 of the special, alumni and term
trustees nominated for election or re—election
were also men, as were the six University

Directors and 12 members of the Executive“

Committee of the UPMC board of directors.
“I’m not volunteering,” DeAngelis said, rais-
ing the first point of discussion more than an
hour into the meeting. “It’s 2003 and I’m just
pointing it out. There are no women.” ’

Although no trustee responded to her state-

ment during the board of trustees’ annual meet-
ing, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg later noted that
female trustee Suzanne Broadhurst serves on the

executive committee as chairman of the institu- ,0

tional advancement committee. She is in the mid-
dle of her term and was not up for re—election this
year. t V»

“I think neither the chief justice [Ralph
Cappy] or I would suggest there isn’t room [for
more women],” Nordenberg said. “But if you
look at the past years, you’ll see that there’s been
a real emphasis on diversity, including getting
women involved.”

Of the 50 current board members, not count-
ing “ex officio” members — members who hold
the position by virtue of their office — seven are
female and nine are black. Women chair two of
the board’s 14 ‘committees.

Aside from DeAngelis’ brief comment, board. 0

members this year conducted a positive, rather
quiet meeting — they voted unanimously to pass
every resolution. Speakers focused on the build-
ing projects that have been completed and will be
completed at Pitt this year and in coming years.
The board also elected Pennsylvania Supreme

‘Court Chief Justice Ralph Cappy as chair, replac-

ing William Dietrich; Dietrich, who will remain
on the board as an active member, said that, after
two years as chairand one as chair-elect, he did
not want toseek re—election to another one-year

‘ term. ‘ . '

Twofmajor building projects dominated the

board’s Property and Facilities Committee
report: the construction of a nine-story, 420-bed
residence hall on Pitt’s Upper Campus, and a
third biomedical tower on Fifth Avenue. But
since current students probably won’t have much
time to enjoy the buildings, which are slated for
completion in fall of 2004 and summer of 2005,
respectively, they might better appreciate the
committee’s plans to remodel many of the more
than 100,000 square feet of restroom space in
Pitt’s main buildings.

“In so many ways, this has been a difficult
year,” Nordenberg said, at the end of his opening
report to the board. He did not detail the events
or circumstances that complicated the year, but
chose rather to express his confidence and pride
in Pitt’s progress.

“We all know that more challenges lie ahead,
but because of the commitment we made eight
years ago, we are in ajmuch better position,”
Nordenberg said. “The best days of Pitt still lie
ahead of us.” » -

Although the board tends to focus on external

tissues, such as improving Pitt’s national reputa-

tion and garnering financial support, Nordenberg
said in a press, conference after the meeting that
he feels he keeps in touch with internal affairs
involving students, faculty and staff. '

trustees, such as the mayor, of Pittsburgh and the governor of Pennsylvania,
are those who hold a position on the board by virtue of their off1ce.'Tom

Pridefest celebrates 30th
anniversary with parade

ERIC SAPORITO
Staff Writer

Parade revelers twirled rainbow-
colored Mylar streamers while march-
ing on the quiet streets of a Shadyside
neighborhood Saturday morning, as the
gay and lesbian community of
Pittsburgh celebrated International
Pride Month.

Interpride, the International
Association of ‘Lesbian, Gay; Bisexual
and Transgender Pride Coordinators,
chose the theme “Pride Through Peace”
to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the
pride parade, which was sponsored this
year by Pittsburgh’s Gay and Lesbian
Community Center, located in Squirrel
Hill.

The focus of this year’s parade was
youth empowerment. The youth group
from the GLCC, joined by cast mem-
bers from City Theatre’s production of
“Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” led the
parade from behind a police escort.

As the parade wound its way
through Shadyside, drag queens in
rhinestones and sequin dresses and men
wearing black leather vests and chaps

danced in the streets,'rode in the backs
of pick—up trucks and waved to
bystanders.

The parade route has changed over
the years; it started Downtown and tin-
ished at Schenley Park in 1973.
Through the years, the parade under-
went many changes, from altered routes
to gaining and losing groups willing to
march in solidarity with the gay and
lesbian community. "

The parade ended in a street fair on
Ellsworth Avenue with games for chil-
dren of gay and lesbian partners,
singers on stage, and face painting. An
informational booth from the Allegheny
Health Department promoted safe sex,
while Pitt ,faculty member Deborah
Aaron recruited volunteers for a
women’s —— hetero— and homosexual —
health study to assess the prevalence
and risk patterns among women with
coronary heart disease. »

The white canopies and tables of
various community organizations lined
three blocks, offering services from
adoption assistance to the help of the
Gay
Development Association.

Steve Donahue was tired and
hungry, but after 25 hours of fasting
on Liberty Avenue, the constant
honking of buses and cars kept him
in good spirits.

“They’ve been beeping their
horns all night,” he said. “It’s a
great feeling of satisfaction.”

Donahue, who is active in both
Save Our Transit and the Thomas
Merton Center, was one of 13 peo-
ple who stayed up outside the State
Office Building from Monday at 11
a.m. until Tuesday at noon, many
with no food, to draw attention to
the pending cuts in funding for pub-
lic transportation in Pittsburgh.

“We’re very~serious — .that’s
the whole point behind staying out
here for 25 hours,” he said. “We
feel like we’re building a movement
here in Allegheny County.” V

Merton Center Executive
Director Tim Vining arrived
Tuesday morning to support the
activists still camped out on the
Downtown sidewalk. He said he’d
received several phone calls in sup-
port of the vigil, including at least
two from people who used

HARRISBURG, Pa. — College
students are often accused of being
politically apathetic, but nine Pitt
students —— including five Student
Government Board members and the
SGB president — helped break that
stereotype when they traveled to
Harrisburg Tuesday to meet with
members of 'Pennsylvania’s state
assembly. .

Their mission: encourage their
representatives to vote in favor of

increasing, or at least maintaining, .

state funding for public transporta-
tion and higher education.

The trip was only the beginning
of the “big things” many SGB mem-
bers promised to do after being elect-
ed in April, according to Board mem-
ber Todd Brandon Morris. He added
that he hopes Pitt has a sustained
voice in the capital now.

With the budget’s deadline
quickly approaching, many state
assembly members said it wasa good
time for students to lobby their repre-
sentatives in the state congress. The
assembly approved Governor Ed
Rende11’s proposed budget earlier
this year, which Rendell then vetoed
and returned. Pitt student Sharon
Paris and SGB member Jesse
Horstmann said that, according to

Penich family will sue Snider

cient evidence to convict her of
murder.

The only evidence the prosecu-
tion was able to produce was a con-
fession Snider gave to FBI investi-
gators after _a three—day interroga-s
tion in the United States, Kim said.

According to Snider, the inves-
tigators coerced her into giving a
false confession.

By Korean law, an acquittal
does not necessarily mean an end to
trial proceedings; the prosecution
was given seven days to appeal the
decision, and Snider could face a
retrial. ‘ "

The Penich family will seek a
civil suit against Snider regardless

of whether or not the appeal is
approved, according to a-June 20
article in the Pittsburgh Post-

Gazette. .

Snider washeld in a South
Korean prison throughout the trial

proceedings. After her release, she '

wrote an e-mail that said she looks
forward to taking a bath and eating
with a fork. She also has a craving
for cheese.

Snider and her mother, Heath
Bozonie, said they are very thank-
ful for Snider’s reasonable treat-
ment throughout her experience.
Bozonie, who stayed in South
Korea throughout the trial, said she
thought the prison guards, as well
as her lawyer’s family, made their
stay as comfortable as -it could be.

Kenzi Snider was acquitted in Seoul, South Korea, of all charges in associajtion
with the murder of former Pitt student Jamie Lynn Penich. ‘ . V

students frequently don’t grasp that drinking too

“My first thought, whenever I hear some-

Pitt’s alcohol education programs teach stu-

until investigators reveal more details of the
case, said Rev. Ronald Lengwin, spokesman for
the diocese. ,

This was not the first time "Krawcyzk came
under examination for being involved in under-
age drinking. Parents of an 18-year-old student
accused Krawcyzk, in 1986, of providing their
son with beer and marijuana while he was a pas-

drank the alcohol in his dormitory and eventual-

At about 10:30 p.m., City of
Pittsburgh police officers arrived at
Cumpie’s, which opened under new
ownership in January, after being
closed for eight months. Police said
the Liquor Control Board would
probably file a citation against the
bar after Friday’s individual cita-
tions. .

According to the Liquor Control
Board, the bar’s previous owners
faced many citations for serving
underage customers.

To prevent the loss of their
liquor license, registration for the

bar transferred from The Next /’

Decade to A.P.Q. Inc, listing Arthur

P. Quinn as the pr€sident,_ secretary,
treasurer and owner. ,

An LCB representative said such
transfers are common when ‘an
owner wishes to pass on a business
that faces many "fines without caus-
ing the license to dissolve. The LCB
performs background checks on
every person involved in -such‘ a

transfer, including Arthur P. Quinn, '

to ensure that the previous and new
owners are not related, the represen-
tative said. ,

The transfer to A.P.Q. Inc.,
which currently faces no citations,
was approved on December 18,
2002.

said he did not provide marijuana or make a sex-
ual advance, Lengwin said. ,

“It still was -not substantiated, especially by
the police,” Lengwin ‘said, explaining that the
student’s parents turned the case over to the
police, who never took action against Krawcyzk.

Vining: slow decreases in public transportation funding lead to false comfort

instance, their involvement led to a
regional convergence and brought
5,000 protesters to the streets of
Oakland last February. Activism for
public transportation, though, is dif-
ferent from protesting war, Vining
said.

Millions can die because ‘of

-poverty imposed by sanctions on a

country like Iraq, but it’s only when
bombs fall and everything happens
at once that large—scale activism
occurs, he said.

Vining compared the difference
to a frog in a pot of water on the
stove. If you turn up the heat just a
little bit — in this case, hike the
rates 25 cents or cut one bus line -
the frog will get used to the new
temperature. Continue doing it
slowly, and the frog — or the public
— won’t get very upset.

“Before you know it,” he said,
“the water’s boiling and the frog is
dead.” '-

Donahue wore a sandwich board

with the words “No rate hikes No ‘

service cuts” written on it in black
marker. After the each “no,” the
word “more” had been inserted.

“It can lull us into a sense that
things are okay,” he said. “They’ve
got us to a point where we’ll take
rate hikes if. there’s no service
cuts.”

Sean Glass, a Pitt senior who
had stayed the night, said that he
expected the outcry to grow if PAT
service is cut. . _ 4

“The people are the source of
the power that the governor wields,”
he said. “If our needs are not being
met, we are prepared to lobby the
people and vote him out of office.”

According to PAT spokesman
Bob Grove, PAT’s fiscal year fol-
lows the state’s, which ends on June
30.

state continues into July without an

approved budget, and, consequent-4

ly, there was no way of knowing
when the PAT budget would be
finalized. The vigil and other forms
of public response effectively drew
attention to the problem, he added.

“We at Port Authority appreciate
the efforts of the Save Our Transit
folks,” he said. _“I think they’ve
done a tremendous job.”

and agree to higher taxes when they saw the pro-
posed types of budget cuts. No such thing hap-
pened, however, leaving the state government to

Rendell’s unusual strategy drew a response
from assembly members. ’ .

“Anyone in political science knows that you
don’t send a budget to a republican House and
Senate and not mean it,” State Rep.‘ Richard Geist,

J R-Altoona,,said. “[Rendell] is like a Baptist minis-
ter — everywhere he goes people leave a believer.”

Geist said that, after 25 years in office, he has
never seen a governor like Rendell. .

If the assembly cannot pass a budget within the
next week, their session will be prolonged.

The federal government gave Pennsylvania
$900 million, and the assembly must also decide
how that money will be distributed. Some state
"legislators want it to go to programs that suffered
cuts —- including public transportation — while

. others have new programs they would like to see

funded. _ ,
SGB President Liz Culliton told a representa-
“ tive from State Sen. Jack Wagner’s, D—Pittsburgh,
office that Pitt might have to increase tuition
another 10 percent, after last year’s 14 percent
increase. « . .

After last year’s increase, State Sen. and Pitt
trustee Jay Costa Jr., D—Pittsburgh, said he “rarely’—’
heard from Pitt students about education spending.
He added he had never seen a Pitt delegation in
Harrisburg during his seven years in the capital.

“It’s as if the stuff that happens here doesn’t
affect them,” he said.

Costa added that the recent push for gambling
in Pennsylvania could help alleviate many of the
money problems. '

Pennsylvania is known for having a “brain
drain,” with many young people getting their edu-
cation within the state, then leaving for better jobs
elsewhere. D

With the cost of education rising, it is difficult
for graduates to stay in the Commonwealth’, where
many cannot earn enough to pay back the student
loans they took out, Morris said.

Between meetings, some students had the

opportunity to see Rendell in a press conference in
the Capitol’s entrance hall. According to him,

; Pennsylvania is ranked 47th out of 50 states for job

creation — a situation that adds to the brain drain.

“The time to change is now,” he said. “Some
say it’s too high a cost, but the cost of doing noth-
ing is higher.” '

Port ‘Authority recently proposed fighting
financial -woes by stopping service for certain
routes after 9 p.m. on weekdays and all day on
Sundays. The service cuts could strand many Pitt
students in Oakland, preventing them from explor-
ing the city and keeping off—campus students from
taking night classes or internships that end at 8:30
p.m. or later. V

The propo'sed ' cuts sparked interest among
many Pittsburgh students, who have ﬂooded their
representatives’ e-mail boxes with letters express-
ing their concern. The Democratic delegation rep-
resenting the Pittsburgh area sent a letter to the
governor about the spending cuts.

Pitt student Sharon Paris said cutting these
routes would further impair the economy by pre-
venting students from taking jobs in the city or
other commercial areas outside -of Oakland.

Geist’, the transportation majority chair and

R.

self-proclaimed biggest mass transportation advo-
cate in the House, said similar cuts in funding were

- taking place in Philadelphia. When asked if the

cuts were as severe there, he explained that each

'department was allotted a certain amount of

moneyfand that services could be cut as each
chose.

One proposal on the floor recommends amend-
ing the Pennsylvania Constitution to allow more
gas taxes to be used for public transportation.

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Pittsburgh, said the
amendment could not pass soon, because an
amendment cannot pass without two congressional
sessions and a statewide referendum. L

Another option, provided by State Sen. Sean
Logan’s, D-Monroeville, chief of staff, Kenneth
Varhola, involves ending a cap on how much
money from sales taxes can be diverted to public
transportation.

0 According to Varhola, 1.22 percent of
Allegheny’s 7 percent sales tax goes toward mass
transit. The total contribution, however, cannot
exceed $75 million each year. If the cap was taken
away, a few more million dollars could become
available.

Some offices, including State Sen. Jim Ferlo’s,
D—Pittsburgh, and Logan’s, also offered to help the
students later in a Get Out the Vote campaign.
They also offered discounted’ hotel rates for the
next time a lobbying group travels to Harrisburg,
to encourage students to get involved.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, whom Logan
described to the students as their lobbyist, was also
in the Capitol Tuesday. '

Three board members, Brian Kelly, Scott

Morley and Peter Stopp, did not attend because of ~

personal reasons, according to Morris and
Williams. — -

Court right in affirmative action ruling

Two days ago, the U.S. Supreme
Court held affirmative action — pro-
grams that take race into account as a
consideration, but not a deciding fac-
tor, in college admissions —— to be
constitutional.

In a 5-4 judgment, the Supreme
Court ruled that the‘ University of
Michigan law school could continue
such a program. In a related case con-
cerning UMich’s undergrad program,
the Supreme Court decided that point
systems were unconstitutional.
UMich had a system that automati-
cally awarded black students 20
points out of the 100 necessary for
admission.

Colleges should be allowed to
favor certain factors, including those
beyond the applicant’s control.
Affirmative action, as part of a thor-
ough review of applications, can
work to promote racial —— as well as
geographic and economic —— diversi-
ty.

The admissions process, when
dealing with qualities that cannot be
quantified, should not be mecha-
nized. Given the overall increase in
college and graduate applications,
time needs to be allotted to review all
applicants — beyond their test scores
and grades.

Admissions should be based not
on what applicants have done, but on
what applicants might do.

Universities should not dissociate
numbers from people, forgetting. that
they are admitting students and not
statistics. ' " ‘
Affirmative action seeks to fix
disparities in opportunities. That
said, it should be a finite program,
one that becomes unnecessary as
other areas of the education system
are fixed. This reflects that true
change takes generations, and that
measures must be taken to remedy
current inequalities. -
Racial inequality is not solely an
issue facing higher education, though
colleges seem to draw the most fire.
Addressing this, Pitt filed a friend—of-

the-court brief affirming that diversi-
ty should be a priority. In a press

release, Pitt commended the decision,

‘calling diversity “a crucial compo-

nent of a premier education.”
Pitt can benefit from the confir-

mation of affirmative action. The law '

school and the undergraduate College
of Arts and Sciences both hover
around 15 percent minorities, accord-
ing to a Fall 2002 head count.
Though these numbers do not reﬂect
local minority percentages, Pitt
should dedicate itself to making their
admissions process as equitable as
possible. A
Affirmative action acts as a
means to get the desired end: a
diverse and interesting student body.

“Harry Potter” should be celebrated, not immolated

There I stood at the Barnes and Noble inforrna-
tion desk at 6:30 p.m. last Friday, smiling ﬂirtatious-
ly at the 17-year-old clerk in a weak attempt to get
my hands on the latest installation of J .K. Rowling’s
phenomenon a few hours early.

I was shot down. _

Crossing his eyes’ to avoid eye contact, in an
awkward moment he mumbled something to the
effect that the company could be sued if they let go
of any of the copies even a few minutes before the
stroke of midnight.

I glared at the salespeople costumed
as Harry Potter, Albus Dumblerdore,
Severus Snape or Moaning Myrtle, as I
walked through the store imagining new, '
more aggressive ploys to get the book.

Alas, I wasn’t able to get hold of my

comic book movie “The Hulk.”

Saturday night, children were not asking their
parents for permission to stay up late to watch a
movie or play another round of Grand Theft Auto —
they were asking to stay up another 15 minutes to
finish off just one more “Potter” chapter.

There is a great thing taking place: This book —
along with the others in the series — is making kids
want to read. And this time they are tackling an 800-
page, pictureless novel.

But children are not the only ones
reading it and becoming involved in the
event. A

I saw at least 10 people between the
-bus and the line at Starbucks with this
book in their hands. College kids, pro-
fessors, businessmen and women were
all speeding through the pages while on
their way to class, work or during coffee
breaks. I

What makes this children’s book

catches my eye. .

No. I haven’t started
book. ,

I think lam afraid of it — it’s. just so big. Not the
actual book, I’m talking about the concept of the
book. .

To read a “Harry Potter” book is to have a glob-
al ‘experience. The book has sparmed the globe, from
a third-grader‘ in Tokyo to priests in the Vatican City
—— everybody isreading. “ a

What makes these books so special? Why has

reading the

iJ.K. Rowling become wealthier than the Queen of

England?
This past weekend, sales of “The Order of the
Phoenixf’ grossed more proﬁt than the opening of the

appealing to an adult audience? What
made me want to get my hands on it
early? And what about it has drawn so much fire
from groups worldwide that are opposed to its publi-

I cation? '

Is it because adults have become so involved in
the story that it has become such a controversy? _

Rowling has been accused of spreading witch-
craft — after the release of the previous book, it was
reported in the Minnesota Star Tribune that a New
Mexico town actually held a book burning.

In their last issue, People Magazine reported that

the books have been accused of being “anti-

Christian”, and parents across the country are seek-
ing to ban the book from their children’s school

libraries.

I wonder whether or not these people have actu-
ally read the books.

I can’t think of anything evil about inspiring kids
to want to read a book.

In a Today Show interview last Monday, mom-
ing, Stephen King talked about why he thought the
books have become so popular. He said he wanted to
ask Rowling at what point did she stop writing for
children? '

According to King, it’s this fact that makes the
Harry Potter story so successful. She writes for all
human beings, not strictly for kids. .

The “Harry Potter” series reﬂects on the human
condition, an aspect of the books that, acknowledged
or not, adult audiences can appreciate.

Her storytelling does not patronize. Rather it
welcomes at first, then it grabs the reader aggres-
sively and doesn’t let go until thevery last page of
the very last book —. which we are all anticipating.

These books are uniting us all; children have
found, in Harry Potter, someone who embodies their
fantasies about rising out of a limiting environment
through magic, while, for adults, it is reintroducing
us to a pastime many have forgotten: reading as a
distraction from the day-to-day stress and various"
insanities of our lives.

For all of you who still haven’t introduced your-
selves to Potter, I suggest you do, but start with the
first book. Don’t be embarrassed. Nobody has to
know. When you have quickly consumed them all,
you will know what I’m talking about. ’

The West began in the ‘Burgh

“Prologue to a Legend”
Lewis & Clark programs

at the Carnegie Science Center
(412) 237-3400

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A&E Editor

Next year marks the bicentennial of the Lewis
and Clark expedition that paved the way for
America’s rapid westward expansion during the
19th century. ’

But this year, Pittsburgh will celebrate its role in
the Lewis and Clark journey with “Prologue to a
Legend,” a yearlong commemoration through
numerous museums, historical societies and reen-
actments of local contributions to the expedition.

Anyone with a working knowledge of American
history knows that the Lewis and Clark expedition,
also known as the “Corps of Discovery,” was
launched in St. Louis in 1804. But what many may
not know is that the keelboat that the Corps of
Discovery used to traverse the
wilderness of the west, and to map

dramatic retelling of the expedition, highlighting
many of the important events during the journey,

A like their meeting with Sacagawea and the conclu-

sion of their expedition inipresent-day Washington
state. The film places emphasis on the natural beau-
ty, as well as the danger, that the western wildemes_s
presented. » _

This approach to the telling of the Lewis and
Clark expedition is a pleasant surprise because, as
21st century Americans, we take for granted land-
marks like the Rocky Mountains or the fact that
there are dangerous waterways that need to be
avoided — we seldom stop to consider what it
would be like to encounter these things without any
forewarning to their awesome scope. '

The film focuses a great» deal on this, showing
what the Corps of Discovery’s reactions were to
such natural formations as the Rockies, and, in/_ the
process, overcomes being a simple documentary and
accomplishes something very difficult: placing us in
the environment of the film and in the mindset of
Lewis, Clark and the rest of the Corps of Discovery.

The second piece of the Science Center’s cele-
bration is their planetarium show. Running close to

out a route to the Pacific Ocean,
was built’ on the shores of
Pittsburgh’s three rivers.
Meriwether Lewis completed most
of scientific and other training
here, and many of Corps of
Discovery’s crew were local.

“Prologue to a Legend” cele-
brates these important contribu-
tions to the Lewis and Clark expe- -
dition, with the first major event
coming from the ‘Carnegie Science
Center. ‘

The Science Center’s part in
this celebration is three-pronged.
The Rangos Omnimax Theater will
be playing “Lewis & Clark: Great
Journey West,” and the Buhl
Planetarium will add “Navigating
with Lewis and Clar ” to their line-
up. The third prong is “Meriwether
Lewis in Pittsburgh and Beyond”
— a photo exhibit presented in
partnership with the Photo
Antiquities Museum _ of
Photographic History -—— highlight-
ing Lewis, his local ties and other
parts of the mission.

The highlight of the series of
events is the Omnimax ﬁlm. The
documentary, presented by
National Geographic, is a 42-minute dramatic reen-
actment of the Corps of Discovery’s journey
through the uncharted west, the perils they faced
and their many encounters with Native American
tribes. J "

Meriwether Lewis and William Clarkilook to the West in the new Omnimax ﬁlm,
. “Lewis & Clark: Great Journey West,” now playing at the Carnegie Science Center

30 minutes, this show is meant to play up what the
Omnimax ﬁlm only touches on: Pittsburgh’s con-
nection to the Corps of Discovery’s journey. At the
same time, it shows the audience how the explorers
used celestial mapping to help get them to the
Pacific Ocean and create better maps of some of the

/

areas that would soon become incorporated into the
United States.

Unlike most planetarium shows, this one uses a I

slide—show approach to tell its story. There are
numerous images and drawings of places the Corps
of Discovery went and of where Lewis received his
training and had the keelboat built in Pittsburgh.

While “Navigating with Lewis and Clark” is an
in—depth look at the scientific end of the expedition,
it’s a much drier experience when compared to the
Omnimax film. This is to be expected; after all,
there is no comparison between a slide show and an
Omnimax experience. I '

However, the information is provided in a bland
way, akin to a classroom lecture, and struggles to be
interesting. This problem is further compounded by
the very little information given about Pittsburgh’s
ties to the expedition. It’s touched on at the begin-
ning of the show, returned to once or twice more,
then forgotten. , ’

“Navigating with Lewis and Clar is a show
that younger kids and those interested in gelestial
science would get more out of than the average
Science Center patron. It’s a good companion to the
Omnimax show, _however, and should be
seen first to make the Omnimax experi-
ence that much better,‘

The. final piece in the Science
Center’s celebration is “Meriwether
Lewis in Pittsburgh and Beyond.” This
exhibit consists of a wall of photographs
and illustrations showing where the Corps
of Discovery went, what Native American
tribes it encountered, communications
Thomas Jefferson had with the expedi-
tion, and various items concerning Lewis’
work in Pittsburgh prior. to the expedi-
tion’s launch. _ . . , —

While there aren’t many photos in

93

the second ﬂoor of the Science Center —
“Meriwether Lewis in Pittsburgh and
Beyond” is something "that history buffs
will enjoy more than anyone.

Additionally, there is a slightly more
local bent in some of the images in the
exhibit, which will give fans of local his-
- 'tory something to enjoy. It does provide a
good, final companion to the Omnimax
and planetarium shows, but it’s a less-
than—overwhe1ming contribution’ to the
overall Lewis and Clark event and is best
saved for the last stop after the planetari-
um and Omnimax.

The Carnegie Science Center’s con-
tribution to “Prologue to a Legend” is one
that whets the appetite for the rest of the
events scheduled around the area throughout the
second half of 2003. By way of its multimedia

‘ approach to telling the Lewis and Clark story, the

Science Center presents to its visitors, in a very

accessible way, an event of incredible importance to I

the history and direction of the United States.

- In 1910, the Associated Artists
of Pittsburgh held its first exhibi-
tion at Pittsburgh’s Grand Opera

House, while the Carnegie
International, another art
show, was held at the

Carnegie Museum of Art.
One year later, the Carnegie

show at the museum, and
there it stayed for,more than 90
years. —

This year, however, the annual
exhibition had to be moved to

"another location for the second year

in a row — last year it was held at
the Andy Warhol Museum — while
the Carnegie Museum of Art under-
goes renovations. *

For the 93rd Annual Exhibition,

 

Pitt invited the AAP to house its
show in the University Art Gallery
at the Frick Fine Arts Building. The
exhibition highlights local talent,
featuring works byartists‘ from the
city andthe surrounding area.

Laura Hoptman, curator of con-
temporary art at the Carnegie
Museum, and Elizabeth Thomas,
the assistant curator, were the
jurors for the exhibition.

The show includes paintings in
oil, watercolor and acrylic, sculp-

tures made of wood and steel,
“pottery, charcoal drawings
and even some works
made of fabric. ,Many
of the works are also
for sale, if you‘ happen
_ to find a piece of art that
you would like to add to

your collection.

But even if you don’t bring your
pocketbook, the exhibition is a hid-
den treasure that deserves a visit-.
It’s large enough to show a broad

ties worldwide, said
Sylvester.

Such is the inspira-
tion for photojournalist
Gideon Mendel and his
current exhibit at the

Kingsley

Association,
“A Broken Landscape.”
Photos and stories of those
in Southern Africa, where
HIV/AIDS rates are at
their highest, are the sub-
ject of this exhibit.
Graphic photos depict
the devastating effects the
disease has on the culture,
while others chronicle the
mission to raise awareness
, about HIV. A look at the
black—and—white photos proves that
no one is safe —— Reverend Gideon
Byamugisha of Uganda was the first
priest in Africa to go public with his
personal fight against the disease.
Timing for the exhibit couldn’t
be better. Friday is National HIV
Testing Day, and there are 10 sites

. HAPPENING ”

for free testing in Allegheny County.
For the squeamish, needles, for the
most part, aren’t going to be used to
test for HIV. The OraSure test will be
given instead.
A swab will be held between the
cheek and gums
r

approximately
three minutes. “What we will be
looking for are HIV antibodies,
which means that the body is fighting
the virus,” said Sylvester. 7
Because the tests are painless and
free of charge, and there is a testing
site here in Oakland, there is no
excuse not to walk up Lothrop Street
to the Pittsburgh AIDS Center for
Treatment and get tested. Results
will be given two weeks from Friday,
on July 11.

A Broken Landscape runs through
July 13 at the Kingsley Association,
6118 Penn Circle South. National
Aids Testing Day is June 27. For

28 days worth of scares

28 Days Later ,4

Starring Cilliain Murphy, Naomie Harris,
Brendan Gleeson

Directed by Danny Boyle

s2n2n.“r1/2

Hallelujah! At long last, hor-
ror doesn’t suck.

Faithful fans of the genre,
those of you who suffered
through “Final Destination 2,”
“House of 1000 Corpses” and
“Wrong Turn,” can thank director
Danny Boyle for delivering you from evil. Or
rather, delivering you to evil. “28 Days Later” is
his best film since “Trainspotting” and the best
horror film to be released in a long time.

It’s a zombie film —— sort of. The monsters
aren’t technically undead; they’re live humans in
the grip of a virus that permanently overtakes
them with violent rage. Structurally, though, the
film takes from the father of zombies, George
Romero “28 Days” is something like his
“Dawn of the Dead” and “Day of the Dead” in
one film. The 28 days Boyle skips over would
have been the “Night of the Living Dead” part.

Before skipping ahead those four weeks, we
see the outbreak begin: activists unwittingly free
lab chimps infected with the 'man—made virus,
which turns out to be highly contagious. _Cut to
Jim (Cillian Murphy) waking up in a hospital
and finding he’s got all of Britain to himself —
or so he thinks. “The infected” ferocious,
bloody—eyed maniacs who come out at night
looking for someone to tear apart —- are his com-

.w'.ov-»...«.......»...-.-.o»...u*§ 9

 

pany. Jim finds
other survivors:
Selena, a tough
woman with a
blade -— right out —
of ‘70s horror —
along with
Frank and
Hannah, an
e n d e a r i n g
father and
d a u g h t e r.
They have no
choice but to e
journey ‘toward
the source of a
repeating radio
broadcast that
promises “the
answer to infection.”
The drab photography ,that Romero used to
conjure dread is replaced here by low—grade dig-
ital video, which gives the film an appropriately
dirty appearance. Occasionally, it’s just blurry,
but most of time it lends a feel of urgency.
Where the film ends up might not look like
horror, but that’s just because we’re not used to
seeing the genre taken this seriously. The film’s
concern shifts to things darker and more imme-
diate, rather than resorting to zombie thrills, but
that doesn’t mean it isn’t horror; it just means it
isn’t cheap.
Go to the late show. And brace yourself: “28
Days Later” is scary stuff.

Journey with Styx on a Speedwagon

Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon
Saturday, June 28

Mellon Arena, $45, $55

All ages

(412) 323-1919

Arena rockers, mullet heads and ‘80s music
freaks rejoice! Heaven awaits you on Saturday
night when Styx, Journey and REO Speedwagon
invade Mellon Arena!

Three of the biggest rock
acts of the ‘70s and ‘80s,
these bands have combined
for numerous hits. Among
them are “Mr. Roboto,”
“The Best of Times,”
“Blue Collar Man (Long
Nights)” and “Too Much Time
On My Hands” from Styx;

Journey’s “Don’t Stop Be1ievin’,”
“Separate Ways (Worlds Apart),” “Lovin’,
Touchin’, Squeezin’” and “Open Arms”; and
REO Speedwagon’s “Take It On the Run,”
“Keep On Loving, You,” “Can’t Fight This
Feeling” and “Riding the Storm Out.”

The three bands have sold out arenas over
the past three decades, made oh so many cheese-
dripping videos and sported countless, ha1f-com-
pleted, business—in-the-front, party-in-the—back
haircuts.

There have been shake-ups with the lineups
for these bands -—— most notoriously, Steve Perry

coNc6KsT

   

journeying away from Journey to pursue a solo
career, only to come back for an ill—fated reunion
in the mid—‘90s — so the faces rocking out on
the Mellon Arena stage might look a little differ-
ent for die—hard fans. But the music will still pop
with the same electricity that makes these bands
staples for a range of radio stations, from classic
rock to light rock, and compilation CDs, from
‘S05 mixes and arena rock discs to those “best
of” love songs and ballads. ,

And as if there wasn’t already enough incen-

tive to head down to the Mellon ~’

, Arena on Saturday night — after
all, when will you next get a
chance to see these three
bands together — it’s an
affordable show. Forty-
five dollars for these three
bands isn’t all that bad when
you. consider that it breaks
down to $15 a band, a price you
would never have been able to pay to see

just one of these bands 10 years ago.

The only thing that could make this lineup
better would be an Earth—shifting appearance
from Steve Perry or a surprise visit from Bad
Company or Foreigner.

Dig that crazy

Spider

Starring Ralph Fiennes, Miranda
Richardson, Gabriel Byrne

Directed by David Cronenberg

awe: ﬁlm

David Cronenberg’s “Spider,” based F
on the novel by Patrick McGrath, is quiet and
sad, yet still manages to be pretty incendiary.

The title character, played with messy nuance by Ralph
Fiennes, has just been released from an asylum, though his
schizophrenia maybe not quite in check

He lands in a dingy halfway house run by the haggard
Mrs. Wilkinson (Lynn Redgrave) and immediately starts
remembering a childhood that may or may not have been
real, which he chroniclesin scrawls that aren’t really a lan-
guage. In hisymemories, several women take on the face of

his real mother (Miranda Richardson), whom he believes his
father (Gabriel Byrne) murdered and replaced with a nasty

“tart.” When the ending gives us a measure of deﬁnitive ’

information, it’s not all that sensational or surprising, but it’s
still aﬂecting. - — 1 -

Fiennes is fully on—board, carrying ‘ the ﬁlm — oddly
enough .— while saying almost nothing, and director
Cronenberg is still messing with our mindspretty hard even
when it seems he’s taking a break '

Gaines remembered for passion, drive

F1iE PHOTO

BillyGaines, shown here getting ready for a play last
August, died June 18 after suffering injuries from a fall.

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

For many football players, taking a bribe is ab
thing. ., ’

But at 9 years old and unsure if he wanted to play
the sport, taking a bribe from hisfather turned out to

be a good thing for Billy Gaines.

“I told him, if he ﬁnished the season, I’d give him

a hundred dollars,” Wﬂharn Gaines said. “He ﬁnished
the year and fell in love with [football] and played ever
smce.”

Billy, a 19-year-old Pitt sophomore, died
Wednesday night, June 18, after suffering head and
spinal injuries resulting from a 25-foot fall from a
crawl space inside St. Anne Catholic Church in
Homestead. ‘ ‘ .

It was during that ﬁrst season that Wﬂliarn noticed
that his son, who was a wide receiver and punt retum-
er in his ﬁrst season with the Panthers in 2002, had the
talent to play for along time. .

At 9 years old, Billy was playing on a team with
10- and 11-year-olds and, according to his father, had
no problem keeping up with them.

_ “I pushed him [to play football] ,” William said. “I
could see he had talent he didn’t know he had.”

. One play that stands out in Williarn’s mind came
late in that ﬁrst season, when Billy\ ﬁelded a muﬁed
punt. After scooping up the ball, William recalled,
Billy sprinted down the middle of the ﬁeld, outrunning
everyone else.

-“They called it back because it was a muﬁ°ed punt,
but I could tell then he had something special, ”
William said.

Despite playing other sports, football became
Billy’s favorite. He spent a couple of years playing
baseball in high school, enjoyed playing golf and even
helped his basketball team win a championship, but it
was on the football ﬁeld that he was at his best

As a wide receiver at Urbana High School in

Maryland, Billy helped lead his team to state titles
from 1998 to 2001. During his career at Urbana, the
Hawks never lost a game, winning a state record 50
consecutive games. He is also the only two-tirne con-
sensus All-State selection from Urbana.

In his ﬁnal high school game, Billy caught the
only touchdown of the game and helped Urbana hold
on to win the 2001 state title, 7-6.

“It seemed like every team he was on was suc-
cessful, they seemed to be good teams,” William said.

Even with his talent, it seemed that it might be dif-
ﬁcult for Billy, who was just 5-foot-7 and. 170 pounds,
to achieve his goal of playing for a Division 1 college
football program. »

But after impressing Pitt head coach Walt Harris
at a football camp, Harris offered the high school star
a scholarship. To‘Harris’ surprise, Billy began to cry.

“I said, ‘Billy, what’s the rnatter?”’ Hanis told the
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “He said, ‘I’ In not big and
I thought I’d have to walk on. This is a dream come
true.’ That really separated him from all the other kids
we had over the years. Now what’s happened makes it
even more difﬁcult.”

“I would want people to remember him as some-

one who overcame a lot of obstacles to reach his goal, '

and that was to play Division I football,” Wﬂliarn said.
“He was a great ﬁiend, always looking out for other
people.” V A -

It was a Fatlier’s Day gift that Billy had recently
purchased that Wﬂliarn believed was a perfect exam-
ple of What kind of person his oldest son was.

“The night he died, I found out he had my
Father’s Day gift in his room; it was a set of golf
clubs,”‘Wﬂliam said. “He couldn’t afford them but,
somehow, he found a way to buy them. That’s just the
kind of son he was, and when I heard that, it hit me
hard.” '

Billy spent his freshman "season as Pitt’s punt

time with my knowledge of

Plenty to gain by watching

-Last week, Joe Marchilena spoke for
the members of the male population who
believe Title IX means that women should
get naked at sporting events to further
equality. We all know those male streakers,
with their beer guts and hairy backs, are just
so attractive.

So, this week, I answer with two
words: tighter pants. I

Now, before I proceed,
don’t get me wrong — I
enjoy baseball as a sport I do
not go to baseball games just
to check out the players —
that is just a perk. I do under-
stand what is going on and
have been known to. shut up a
few drunken, male fans in my

the sport

So, with that said, if you
ladies that read the sports sec-
tion go to enough baseball

, games at PNC Park, you, too,

know exactly what I am talk-

ing about If you sit in leftﬁeld, where you
are, at times, about 10 feet away from the
players, you see and hear it too.

It could be the drunken women yelling
at Brian Giles for his “nice ass,” or the
groups of young girls checking out the
attractive ﬁeld security guards. Either way,

‘the leftﬁeld bleachers are the place for

action, and we are not just talking about the
game. ’

Now, if you guys expect women to
streak across the ﬁeld, I expect the leftﬁeld-
er to wear some tighter pants. He doesn’t
even have to get naked. I mean, Brian,
come on, we all know you have one awe-
some physique under that bulky uniform.
Take a lesson from Dodgers’ leftﬁelder
Brian Jordan and show off.

You shouldn’t have to be bending for
a baseball for the girls to be able to check
you out Jordan lets it all hang out, so to
speak. I-Iis uniform is sotight you can see
his muscles ripple when he moves. There
isn’t much more of a sexy sight than that.

Some other reasons to sit in leftﬁeld

include the Mets’ Cliff Floyd, the Braves’ -

Chipper Jones and, believe it or not, the

N. Oakland ~. Millvale Ave
at,‘ (Across from Pep Boys)

 

Spears Vnzvt

Shaunna 

Diamondbacks’ Luis Gonzalez. I have
caught all three of these outﬁelders check-
ing us ladies out whﬂe we are sitting in left-
ﬁeld.

I must admit, despite receiving glances

‘from Gonzalez and making the security.

guard blush, female baseball fans ﬁnd a
much greater joy in the leftﬁeld bleachers.
Pre-game warm-ups are awfully ﬁm to
watch. You have Giles and
Ararnis Ramirez going yard
and players signing autographs
around the ﬁeld. But the
excitement occurs for fans on

young and attractive pitching
staff warms up.

They stretch, they bend,
they run, they throw and they
wear tight pants. This is my
reason for going to the ballpark
90 minutes early. Not only do
they take their warm-ups seri-

. ously, but they also take time
_ out for the fans. '

I mean, Josh Fogg is seriously bending
that way for me to take a picture, right?
What other reason is there?

But I must admit I’ve witnessed Fogg,
Mike Williams and members XYZ of the
Pirates’ pitching staff sign autographs for
the fans and actually hold conversations
with them. I know this all too well, as my
mother told Fogg that she was “so excited
to meet her future son—in-law.” Yeah, I was
pretty embarrassed that game.

But there is truly nothing better at a ball
game, tight pants included, than to see a
young kid get a ball from one of the Pirates.
They just light up, making you realize what
the game is truly about Then people like
me feel guilty for talking about ‘why the
players need to show off their muscular
bodies more. It isn’t about streakers or tight
pants; it is about fulﬁlling dreams and
doing what you love to do.

But I still love looking at baseball play-
ers in tight pants. ’

Shaunna Stuck is at columnist for The Pitt
News and swears that she is NOT obsessed
with Josh F ogg. Nope, not at all. i

Pitt competes at championships

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer"

. Five Panthers participated in the
Women’s Track and Field NCAA
Championships on June 10th in
Sacramento, Calif. Two Pitt sophomores,
Maureen McCandless and Tamara
McGil1, placed in the top 15 in the coun-
try in their respective events.

After ﬁnishing 2l0tli nationally in
cross country this past fall, McCandless’
time of 17 minutes, 6.7 seconds in the
5,000-meter race during the season was
good enough to qualify her for the track
and ﬁeld championships.

McCandless did not disappoint in
Sacramento, placing l4tli in the nation in
the 5,000-meter race with F a time of
16:54:38. ,

At the Big East Conference
Championships last month, McGill won
the heptatlilon, qualifying her for the
NCAA Championships and earning her
the ‘Big East’s award for /Most
Outstanding Field Performer of the Year.
In Sacramento, McGill placed 14th in the
heptatlilon, scoring 5,162 points.

Also qualifying and appearing in the

NCAA Championships _for Pitt were.

sophomore Kimberly Lyles and juniors
Elizabeth Bayne and Melanie Carter.
Bayne qualified for the NCAA
Championship in the 400-meter hurdles.
At the East Regionals, Bayne qualiﬁed by
ﬁnished second, with a time of 57:58. She
was recently named the Mondo Mid-
Atlantic District Track Athlete of the Year.
Carter qualiﬁed for the NCAA
Championships in the triple jump. Earlier
in the season, Carter won the Eastern
College ' Athletic Conference
Championship and then the Big East
Championship in the triple jump. Her

jiunp of 12.76 meters in the East Regional _.

qualiﬁed her to go to Sacramento.

After participating on two winning
relay teams at the ECAC Championships,
Lyles qualiﬁed for the NCAA
‘Championships at the Big East
Conference Championships with a time of
23:25 in the 200—meter race.

Also receiving an award was Pitt head
coach Alonzo Webb, who received the
Mondo Mid-Atlantic District Coach of the
Year honor.

S Gaines was a punt returner as a freshman

was the youngest guy out there,” he said. “I
think he was going to be a great player. He
needed time to grow.”

‘ Billy had been using this off-season as
that time, adding about 10 pounds of mus-
cle, and he “really turned from a boy to a
man,” his father said.

“He would have done some special
things,” \V1lliam said. “It’s tough not
knowing how far he would have gone.”

Charlie Robertson of the Chicago
White Sox pitched a perfect game at
Detroit on April 30, 1922, and ﬁn-
ished his career with a 49-80 record.
