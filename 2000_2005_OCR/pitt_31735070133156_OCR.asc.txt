Friday night outside Pitt
Graduate School’s ._Public Health
Auditorium, Khadra Mohammed".
explained to Pitt students the survival
instincts that kick in-when war breaks
out in the neighborhood. V

“When bombs are dropping, you
just gotta run,” Mohammed said. ‘

The benefit concert Jamnesty
2003, sponsored by Pitt’s chapter of
Amnesty International, featured‘ the
rock bands Undermine and The
Channel, hip-hop group Universatile
and a speech by Mohammed.

Admission was a donation of $2
to $5, a canned good or an unused
toiletry item. Early in the benefit
concert, about 15 people witnessed

the rock band Undermine, who

pumped up the audience with their
heavy-driving rock sound. -._.. '

_“They have to be respectful of
other “cultures,” Mohammed told
Lauren Singer, the president of Pitt
Amnesty. “I don’t want someone to
tell them to go back home.”

Respect is an important prerequi-
site for volunteers who interact with
refugees because, as Mohammed
said, “You have to keep in mind the

trauma they have to-deal with [in]‘

leaving their countries.
“They were not prepared. They

Live librarians take tothe Internet

Housing problems. A

DYLAN HEIMBROCK
Staff Writer

VV1th the start of the new Ask—A—
Librarian LIVE program at Pitt, students
can ﬁnd out what books and magazines
the libraries on campus have without
leaving the comfort of their dorms.

According to Elizabeth Mahoney,
coordinator of the University Library
System digital reference service, Ask—A—
Librarian LIVE began as a way for stu-
dents who could not ﬁnd the time to go
to the library to access the electronic
card catalog from their own computers.

An easy—to—use interactive chat pro-
gram puts students in contact with librar-

ians who not only answer‘ their ques-
tions, but also show them how they can
ﬁnd the information they are looking for
themselves on the library’s Web site,
www.library.pitt.edu.

The librarians not only help students
ﬁnd information from all of the libraries
on Pitt’s Oakland campus, but they can
also help students request books from
Pitt libraries on other campuses, such as
the ones at Greensburg and J ohnstown.

Requested books usually make it to
Pittsburgh within a week.

The live interaction isn’t the only
part of Ask—A—Librarian. Since a librari-
an can’t be available to answer questions
24 hours a day, there is also an e—mail

portion of the service. To use the e—mail
service, a student must ﬁll out an e—mail
reference question form. VV1thin 24 to 48
hours, a librarian sends back an answer.
To spread the word about the new
service, the, library has given out mag-
nets and put up posters throughout cam-
pus. The library is also giving free T-
shirts to the ﬁrst hundred users of the
service. .
The service is available to all Pitt
students. The Ask—A-Librarian chat por-
tion is available Monday through Friday

‘ from 12 to 5 p.m. Students seeking help

at any other time will be automatically
bumped from the chat section to the e-
mail section of the service.

contribute to the fund.

In the event the union does not
strike, he said the money would be
donated to charity that supports
low—income people.

“If there’s going to be an
increase in money for the janitors,
it’s got to come from the big corpo-
rations,” he said.

Members of 32 union and com-
munity organizations — including

the Labor Religion Coalition of‘

Western Pennsylvania, the United
Food and Commercial Workers
Local 23,. the United Steelworkers
Women of Steel and members of
Pitt’s Students in Solidarity ——
came to support Pittsburgh’s jani-
tors Friday morning. Hoffman
added that Andrew Palm, interna-
tional vice president of the United
Steel Workers of America, was also
in attendance.

The grounds crew and janitors
at Pitt are also members of SEIU,
and though the union successfully

renegotiated their contract with Pitt
during the summer, several turned
out to support their fellow workers
Downtown. James Smith, a janitor
at the Graduate School of Public

_ Health, proudly wore his SEIU rib-

bon, saying it represented the fight
for health care for all working peo-
ple in Pennsylvania.

“This is the best health care that
we’ve ever had, butwe know it can
get better,” Smith said in reference
to Pitt’s'new contract and its provi-
sions for health care. “We only
make so much money, and the per-
centage they take_ out is too much.”

Hoffman did ‘not comment on
the current state of negotiations

with the building’ managers and"

cleaning contractors- of the down-
town office buildings, but he said
several negotiation sessions have
been scheduled for this week. He
added that SEIU will hold a Justice
for Janitors Defense Fund Benefit

for all ages at the Shadow Lounge ’

on Oct. 251:0 draw further support

for the fight for health care.

Prison work crews toclean up the state

Over the next six months, crews
of minimum-security prisoners will
be cleaning up Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania Department of
Corrections, together with PennDOT,
plans to have prisoners from all 25 of
the state’s prisons doing litter pick-
up, light sweeping and minor bridge
cleaning along the 40,500 miles of
state—owned highways.

Rather than these minor offend-
ers lifting in the yard or breaking big
rocks into smaller rocks, having
them do community service in such a
visible manner that benefits so many
people is an excellent way for them
to quite literally pay off a debt to
society.

With minimal security prisons

‘fueling the crews, it’s not as if

Hannibal Lecter is out there running
loose. The offenders who would be
eligible for the program would be
mostly repeat DUI-Offenders and
those who had committed minor
felonies. The program will begin in
sparsely populated areas until citi-
zens get used to seeing the orange-
uniformed crews out on the road.
Keeping the option to only mini-
mum—security offenders also pre-
cludes the possibility‘ of escape.
Simple arithmetic tells someone
serving a few years in a facility,
where they have the option of getting
out in the air occasionally, that bust-

ing out will result in a much stiffer
penalty, with many more years of
much harder incarceration. And it’s
not as if they won’t be supervised.

None of the labor that the prison-
ers do will supplant union jobs. This
program will allow PennDOT work-
ers to attend to more important
things, but won’t put them out of
work. i

Serving the community in this
way means that prisoners won’t just

be sponging off the state, getting

three meals and a roofover their
heads as a reward for breaking the
law. This should help assuage com-

plaints from some critics of the state

prison system.

_, With no money to spare, state”

citizens are probably suffering from
low morale. Seeing clean streets, at
minimal extra‘ cost, can only make
people feel better. Times are bad -
there’s no reason not to do something
cosmetic for improvement, especial-
ly one we don’t have to pay much
for. V

Released prisoners who partici-
pated in this voluntary program
could be better equipped to re-enter
society than those who didn’t.
They’ll be likely to take pride in the
area they cleaned. And, as anyone
who’s ever had cigarette-butt detail
will testify to, they’ll be much less
likely to litter themselves.

Dear Sex N’ at:

While I was standing around with some
of my co-workers during some down time,
one of my co-workers, let’s call him Jason,
asked me if I would “f——-” a female cus-
tomer he had just helped.

When I decided to just ignore the ques-

tion he asked me again. Afemale co-worker, -

let’s call her Lisa, had been listening the
whole time and had said nothing at this
point. She had been a topic of the same type
of discussion with Jason only a
couple minutes ago in which I
had again said nothing.

“I’d make her bleed,
wouldn’t you?” he prodded.
Granted, I would’ve liked to
have sex with this girl but I’m
not going to scream that in pub-
lic, nor would I’ve had
expressed it in those terms.

Lisa only smiled and said,
“What’s wrong, you got to tear
that s— up.” Then she said

ation. ,
Jason is disgusting, not for thinking he
like to make sweet love to —— or, ya know,
assault — an attractive customer. He’s a sad
little boy because he decided to foist his sex-
ual impulses on you and Lisa in the most

vulgar-terms possible. He has no conﬁdence ' W

in himself as a sexual being, and thus has to
resort to puerile displays of chest-pounding
and dick-showing. A
Look, we’ve all got sex drives. Whether
. A we act on them or r1ot, every-
.one’s_ had a moment where
they come across someone
who revs their engine and
makes all thoughts but those of
doin’ the nasty leave their head
This is normal and healthy.
Informing your co-workers of
such a moment shows a com-
plete lack of respect for social

retard Jason is. __
On to Miss Lisa. She has

someﬂiing that really burned
me. She said, “You’re just a ,
nice boy.” A
_ What irked me was the condescending
tonein which she said it and the fact that she
used the term “boy” to describe me. I don’t
have the sexual experience that either one of
them have by a long shot but it irks me that
people thinkyou’re still akidbecauseyou’re
not as sexually experienced as they are.
My question is, am I being a prude?
Am I taking some commonplace josh-
ing harder than I should? Should I lighten

up? Am I so far behind in the sexual revolu- ’

tion that women can joke about such things
but I can’t?

Confused and Pissed Olf
Dear CAPO:

What a revolting —— and unfortimately,
commonplace — scenario you’ ve

described. I don’t know who is more defec-
tive: Jason or Lisa Maybe she called you a
boy, but you were the only adult in the situ-

absolutely no self-esteem and

.she’s afraid to try relating to

men as a human being, -not just as a recepta-
cle for morons like Jason. She was too
scaredto stand upto a Neanderthal like
Jason, for fear of being branded —— heavens,
no! —— a feminist, or some otherspecies who

won’t let the Jasons of the world talk to her .

likethat. Shewastooaﬁaidtotellhimwhat
a  animal he was being, so she
played along, and you, the real man in the

.room,. provided an easy scapegoat so she

could further escape dealing with Jason’s
booiish behavior. ‘ w
The sexual revolution did indeed
up sexual discourse between men and
women. The _scenario you describe wasn’t
discourse. It was two immature idiots unable
to carry’ on any sort of‘ useful dialogue, so
they resorted to bathroom humor and ﬁnger.-
pointing. What a shame for them.

Congress and Bush:Aborting the trend,

It’s hard to say where the Partial-Birth Abortion

I Ban Act of 2003 is sitting today, somewhere among the

to the 108th, and so would be old news by now if
Clinton wasn’t such a quick draw with a veto pen. Add

gears and axles of government. No major newspaper 27 states with their own bans, and we’ve got ourselves

has come across any new information in the
past two weeks. But when we last saw it,
the Act was cruising through Congress and
heading for the president, needing only his
promised signature to become law. This
will happen — probably very soon — and 
when it does, it will solidify a point that
opponents and supporters can agree on:
George W. Bush is slowly, meticulously
dismantling Roe vs. Wade.

For the pro—choice comer, Bush’s
growing momentum against abortion sig-
nals a major threat. For tomorrow’s chil-
dren, it signals a major victory. Though the
partial—birth abortion ban will likely face legal opposi-
tion after its passage, it will have at least been passed,
becoming a new high point in the anti—abortion ﬁght,
and made all the more’ dramatic because it comes on the
30th anniversary of the decision that made abortion
legal.

Bush’s abortion policies are criticized from time to _

time, but never too ﬁercely. This is because they are
executed so smoothly that the critics and press barely
take notice, and if they do, each reform seems so
insigniﬁcant it barely warrants attention. But the par-
tial-birth abortion ban is different —- its passage will
raise hell.

In the coming weeks, liberal commentators .from
around the country will hit the keyboards, screaming
Bush’s evils. But when that happens, let’s not forget
that the President isn’t democracy’s only voice — ver-
sions of this act were passed by three congresses prior

a consensus.

Abortion supporters —-though I might
call them anti—life, since by their standards
I am anti—choice are quick to point out
that pa1tial—birth abortion is not a medical-
ly accepted term. It’s too controversial.
They would prefer something more neu-
tral, specifying abortion during or after the
second trimester. That’s the way it always
goes with pro-choice philosophy -——_— think-
ing on a theoretical plane makes it easier to
gloss over the cold, sterile ‘harshness of it
all.

The entire abortion movement is a
chameleon, changing its colors to match the environ-
ment. In ’73 it was about privacy, in ’03 it’s about
choice, in ~’33 — if it’s still around -- it will probably
be about population. But anti—abortion is consistent. It’s-
always been about protecting babies, about opposing
one of the greatest vices of our generation.

This ban, once enacted, will achieve two Very sig-
niﬁcant goals. The ﬁrst, protecting babies from being
killed, is pragmatic. The second is more general — it
will raise awareness about a terrible practice that peo-
ple love to sugarcoat.

During a partial—birth abortion — or whatever term
you choose — part of the baby’s body is actually deliv-
ered. Sometimes it’s the head, sometimes it’s the lower
half up to the navel. A few inches either way, and the
baby would be ofﬁcially born. After part of the body
has been delivered, the baby’s skull is pierced and a
miniature vacuum is inserted to suck out the child’s

saving the children

brain. Anti-abortion activists often display pictures of .

things like this in public. The most- moving shot I’ve
seen was of a baby’s tiny hand grabbing the doctor’s
ﬁnger, moments before being aborted. So -it’s no sur-
prise that activists often get kicked out of their venues.
People don’t want to see what their “choice” leads to.
In partial—birth abortion, murder and medical pro-

cedure are separated by inches. But those few inches

have been important because they deﬁne the subject. A
baby with its head delivered is just a fetus, part of the
mother’s- body and therefore part of her choice. But
move the child any further and it becomes a United
States citizen, protected by the Constitution. It’s amaz-

ing to me how the Democratic party "line supports .
. killing children, citing location — in inches — as a jus-

tiﬁcation. ' 

I think it’s a fair assumption that the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act of 2003 will pave the way for others
like it, each one a piece of legislation,30 years overdue.
Opponents are waiting in the wings; armed with fash-
ionable, highbrow arguments about a woman’s right to
choose, but they will never" approach the cold, hard
facts about our abortion institution. Doctorswho swore
to the Hippocratic Oath are willing to slice a defense-
less child’s head open and with callous precision rob
him of everything he has or will have, all before he can
open his eyes. i i

‘That is an evil I could devote my life to ﬁghting,
and George W. Bush is doing it, slowly, but more and
more surely all the time. '—

Eric Miller believes  a woman ’s_ right to choose and
live her own life, even if her heart just started beating.

Full of wires and weird science, monkey brains can move -matter

What would you consider the great-
est scientiﬁc achievement in the history
of humankind? Fire? Yeah, that was
pretty good, but I think some scientists
in North Carolina have stumbled upon
something much cooler. Granted, it
required some gruesome treatment of
defenseless animals, but the end result
was totally awesome. ,

Through the diligent efforts of
North Carolina scientists, monkeys now
have the ability to control robotic arms
with nothing but their thoughts.

I know, it sounds way too good to
be true. I read about it in a Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette article, though, so I am not
dreaming.

Miguel Nicolelis of Duke
University was the head of this exceed-
ingly silly experiment in which wires
implanted directly into the brain of a
monkey were directed into a computer,
which was hooked up to a robotic arm in
another room. Eventually the monkey,
whose name has gone unmentioned,
was able to watch a schematic of the
arm on a computer monitor and control
the arm’s movement simply by thinking.

But if you ask me, science like this
poses more questions than it answers.

For example, how does one connect a experiments.

I feel it has way ‘more commercial

monkey brain to a PC? Well, Nicloelis’s
group started by removing chunks of the
monkey’s skull to expose the raw brain
underneath. After that, about
96 wires were shoved mil-
limeters deep, directly into
the brain. A kind of monkey-
skull cement was used to ﬁll
the hole . in the animal’s
head.

Isn’t science fun?

While we are all
applauding the revolutionary
efforts of Nicolelis and his
monkey research team, I
thought it might be enlight-

   

ening to gain the monkey’s

perspective on the issue. I ponder how
an interview with the monkey would go.

Me: Monkey, how do you feel about
this whole robotic arm experiment?

Monkey: I’m tellinj you, Kurt, this
is absolute [expletive]. One minute I’m
swinging through my habitat, urinating
on intruders, picking lice out of my
buddy’s. fur, and the next minute I’ve
got some southem—fried eggheads shov-
ing wires into my brain.

Me: So you’re opposed to the

 

Kurt Esenyvein
Columnist

’Monkey: Yes. I mean, sure it’s great
that I’m part of some technological
advancement, but honestly I just wanted
' to use that giant robotic arm
to ﬂing my feces at those
Carolina nirnrods. I wish I
could’ve been trained to do
something more fun like
smoke cigarettes or ride
around on roller skates.
Say, could I burn a cig off
you? '_ -

Me:
smoke. _

Ironically, the robotic
arm was kept in a room
separate from the experi-
mental monkeys because, as Nicolelis
explains, “if you put a 50—kilogram
robot in front of them, they get very ner-
vous.” Apparently a monkey ﬁnds noth-
ing nerve—racking about having a hun-
dred wires jammed directly into its cen-
tral nervous system.

So what are we to do with this mon—‘
key—robot telepathy? The scientists
seem to think technology¥like this could
be used to help paralyzed individuals
operate tools or even lifeless ligaments.

potential. .

A friend of mine suggested that
massive robotic suits be made for mon-
keys, which they could use to do battle
with other robot—equipped animals
using nothing but their thoughts. I think
a cordless version should be made. VV1th
that, a monkey could use its thoughts to
control all electronic devices in the
household, from toasters to light ﬁx-
tures. ’-

“Monkey, turn on the television. I i

think the robot-animal ﬁghts are on.”
And with a grimace and a small amount
of concentration, the monkey would
activate your television and tune it to the
station of your choosing. -I

How to get a go] en tan t

ASHLEY MAGUIRE
Staff Writer

As the days grow shorter, your
skin glows paler. There are many
options, though, to fight the pasty
white look this fall —— and they
don’t all involve ultraviolet rays.
Here are the ways to stay sun-glis-
tened during the chilly months
ahead, keeping you hot and looking
like you belong in California rather
than on Pitt’s campus.

Don’t get me wrong. This is not
to say that you have to be tan to
look good. These are merely tricks
for those of you who obsessively
tan and think you know all there is
to know about looking bronzed.
And there are also guidelines for
those of you who have never had a
tan bum before.

First, tanning salons are one of
the most common ways to get a nat-
ural-looking, golden suntan.

Natural, if you’re going in only a
couple times a week at 48-hour
intervals. Beach Barbie who looks
like she’s wearing a leather jacket is
rather funky — and not in a good
way. Right here on campus, both
Oakland Oasis Tanning Studio and

Puccini are tanning salons you can
hit up on your way to class.

Drugstore self—tanners are
another option for you tan gods and
goddesses. Of course, you have to
be extremely careful when rubbing
this sunlight-in-a-tube on your skin.
You don’t want to give the impres-
sion that you have no running water
in your apartment and have never
heard of soap.

There are tricks to get around
this, too. Next time you’re about to
lube up, try putting a lotion all over
your body before you apply the
self-tanner. This will rid your arms
and legs of fingerprint streaks.
Trust me, there is nothing more
embarrassing than looking streaky
and freaky. Try Osmotics’
“Extremely Natural Self Bronzer”
from Sephora. This productis not
only long-lasting but also goes on
evenly and gives your skin a glow
that isn’t ﬂuorescent orange.

Note: If you’ve heard of the
recent excitement surrounding tan-
ning salons and the new spray-on
tan, I’m warning you right now —
be careful. Last week’s episode of
“Friends” showed David
Schwimmer five shades darker.

Remember Beach Barbie?

If you’re still walking around
Sephora, ‘pick up their skin illumi-
nator. Another rub-on lotion, it
gives the effect of just coming in
from the sun. At the. samegtime, i-t
gives your skini5a;f?s1rb.tle glow that
will show off your _best facial fea-~
tures and legs and shoulders;

While self-tanning isnftt for‘

everybody — you may be one of
those people who can’t seem to rid
yourself of those fingerprint marks.

thing, assuming

Comm.

There are certain films that are
enjoyable because of the actors
more than the story. “Runaway
Jury” is one such film —— a pre-
dictable work that has its moments,
but serves best as a showcase for
the talents of John Cusack, Gene
Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. .

Based‘ on the book by John

_ Grisham, “Runaway Jury” focuses
on the world of jury consults ‘—

unsympathetic, smarmy and willing
to do whatever it takes to secure the

The consultant on the prosecu-

Lawrence Green (Jeremy Piven) is
a‘ wide-eyed junior partner’-type
-who wants to get the gun compa-

prosecution is the prosecutor,
Wendell Rohr (Hoffman), a kindly,
moralistic Loilisianan that only
wants to get justice for the victim
and who’s being crushed under the
circumstances of the case and the
weight of his own morality.
Thrown into the mix is Nick
Easter (Cusack), a slacker who
doesn’t want jury duty —— or does

scene between Hoffman and
Hackman in the courthouse bath-
room. Hackman looms large in the
scene, thanks to his towering
stature compared to Hoffman and
the way director Gary Fleder
frames them in the bathroom mir-
ror: Hackman large and imposing,
Hoffman small and feeble looking.
They go back and forth on a moral
battle about juries and the system,
Hoffman fighting a losing battle
against a morally bankrupt and
nefarious Hackman.

It’s a scene that, like the scene
between Hackman and Cusack,
makes the film much better than it
would have been otherwise, allow-

ing these actors to do what they do
best. But the Hackman—Hoffman
scene in particular is more than
noteworthy —+ it’s the first
between two ofxthe best American
actors of-the past 30 years. And,
unlike the scene between Robert
De Niro and Al Pacino in “Heat,”
it doesn’t disappoint.
Unfortunately, the same cannot
be said about “Runaway Jury.” It’s
a typical Grisham adaptation that
never becomes more than a filmed
book. —— mostly because many
times his books are set—ups for a
future -adaptation.

‘ The Scarlet Knights have lost
25 ‘consecutive’ Big East
conference football games.

 

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA/CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Larry Fitzgerald caught eight passes on Saturday for acareer-high 207 yards and two touchdowns, but couldn’t quite
come up with this catch against Rutgers. Pitt hung on to defeat the Scarlet Knights, 42-32.

Pitt hangs on to beat Rutgers

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

PISCAT'AWAY, N.J. —— By the end of the
first half of Saturday’s game against
Rutgers, Pitt had surpassed its season aver-
age in offensive yards and points.

But someone forgot to tell the Panthers
there was still another half of football left.

Pitt gained just 67 yards on offense in
the second half, but the Panthers held on
and defeated the Scarlet Knights, 42-32, in
front of a Homecoming crowd at Rutgers
Stadium. ‘

The Panthers (4-2 overall, .1-0 Big
East) piled up 427 yards in the ﬁrst half,
including 347 yards through the air, to take
a 42-7 halftime lead. But Rutgers (3-4, 0-3)
found a way to get back into the game,
scoring 25 unanswered points — including
a 19-point third quarter.

“We played physical and gave 110 per-
cent, but something wasn’t right,” defen-
sive end Claude Harriott said. “They out-
coached us in the second half by making
adjustments.”

“It’s very frustrating because ..
they’re giving us everything we want, it’s
just we’re not executing,” quarterback Rod
Rutherford added. “It was going so well in
the ﬁrst half and to have it go so bad in the

second half is deﬁnitely frustrating.”

’ After running back Brian Leonard
scored his fourth touchdown of the game,
with 4:27 to go to pull Rutgers within 10,
Pitt was unable to nm out the clock.

The Scarlet Knights got the ball back
with 2:28 to go in thegame and quarterback
Ryan Hart wasted little time moving the
ball down the ﬁeld. Hart completed a pass
for six yards to wide. receiver Shawn
Tucker and another pass for ﬁve yards to
wide receiver Jerry Andre.

VV1th a little more than 90 seconds

remaining, Hart, who threw for a career-
high 384 yards, looked deep for wide
receiver Marcus Daniels.

Daniels had found his way behind the

defense, but Hart’s pass was too short and .

safety Tez Monis stepped up and made the
interception, sealing the win for Pitt. '
“It’s disappointing, but it would be
more disappointing if we lost,” head coach
Walt Harris said. “Obviously, we let

[Rutgers] off the hook  but it

wasn’t totally the defense’s responsibility.
They preserved the victory. [The oﬁense]
put them in some bad situations.”

For the. second week in a row, wide

receiver Larry Fitzgerald recorded all of his
numbers in the ﬁrst half, catching eight
balls for a career-best 207 yards and two
touchdowns. Fitzgerald has now scoreda

touchdown in a Big East— and Pitt-record
12 straight games, one shy of the national
record set by Michigan State’s Charles
Rodgers last season. 1

Rutherford also set a career high, pass-
ing for 381 yards to go along with three

_ touchdowns on 22-of-38 passing, however,

he completed just two passes after the ﬁrst
half

The Panthers’ nmning woes continued;
most of the tearn’s 113 yards rushing yards
came on nmning back J awan Walker’s 55-
yard touchdown nm in the second quarter.
The defense also struggled, and the Knights
became the third team to compile over 500
yards against Pitt’s defense this year, out-
gaining the Panthers 516 yards to 494. _

“First half seemed that everything, we
were doing was working,” olfensive tackle
Rob Petitti said. “It seemed a little too easy
and obviously, Rutgers went in and made
some adjustments. Their coaches did a
good job and made it a little harder for us.”

Pitt looked as if it would continue
moving the football in the second half,
marching down to the Rutgers’ 23 on its
ﬁrst possession of the half. But David
Abdul’s ﬁeld goal try from 40 yards out
went wide right and the Knights’ offense
took over. A ‘

Trying times in the City of Pittsburgh’s
economy call for novel solutions. And I’ve

got one.

Bring the Olympics to the ‘Burgh.

Of course the city itself wouldn’t be
able to foot the bill for such an event, what
with its current ﬁscal crisis and all, but there
are enough sponsors and private investors
out there that could be swayed into pledging
support with the right motivation.

Make local businesses realize the great
potential for gains that inherently exist in
hosting an international event of the
Olympics’ scale. Convince the airlinehubs
of the proﬁts to be made down the road.

. The earliest possible games — not
already contracted to a city -— are the sum-
mer games of 2012. But the deadline for city
applications is all but in the past, making it
close to impossible for Pittsburgh to join as
a prospective city. Therefore it is far more
logical t’o focus on the winter games
2014. ‘

Can it be done? Yes, butthe planning
must start immediately. Olympic bidding is
not arr overnight process, especially for

To Pittsburgh’s advantage, however, is
the fact that the Olympics are"set to take
place in other nations from 2004 through
2010. Additionally eight of the nine appli-
cants forthe 2012 games are not American
cities. If an international city wins the con-
test for the summer games of 2012, an
appeal for another American-hosted games
could be very plausible. ’

Does Pittsburgh have the facilities to
host the Olympics? Yes and no.

No, Pittsburgh does not yet have all of
the’ necessary structures for the winter
games. But no host ever does. Designating
construction for the Olympics, and out-
stretching the games to surrounding regions,
is far from unorthodox. V

Pittsburgh is primed for such an under-
taking. In comparison with Salt Lake City,
host of the 2002 winter games, Pittsburgh is
ahead of where it would need to be.

Easy victory over Rutgers turned into tough road win

Rutgers was just what the doctor
ordered. '4

At least for a half.

After last week’s effort —— or lack
of it —— in a loss against,Notre Dame,
and the loss against Toledo two weeks
prior to that, the Panthers needed a
boost to launch them into the second
half of their season, where opponents
the likes of Miami and Virginia Tech
await.

And what a boost Rutgers was to
the Panthers during the first half of
Saturday aftemoon’s game.

Quarterback Rod Rutherford

passed for 347 yards and three touch-
downs, wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald
caught eight passes for 207 yards and
two touchdowns, and running back
Jawan Walker rushed for 70 yards,
including a 55-yard. run, and two
touchdowns. .

The defense was equally impres-
sive in the first half. Rutgers was held
to 154 total yards and only four first
downs and the Panthers defense
caused three fumbles and recovered
two.

For the Panthers to play ‘as domi-
nantly as they did. against. Rutgers in
the second quarter was impressive.

The offense marched down the ﬁeld .

easily, drive after drive, and the
defense stopped all but one Rutgers
drive. 7

The first half ended with the
Panthers leading Rutgers by a score of
42-7, and it looked like the Panthers’
team that was supposed to compete
with the best teams in the Big East this
season was coming through on that
promise, even if slowly and against a

team like Rutgers. But the question

was being asked — are the Panthers
that good or is Rutgers that bad?
When the sec- ‘
0nd half began, the S 
team that scored 42
points and held its
opponent to seven
points was gone,

   

 isw-

on Saturday became a‘ game where the
Panthers showed just what kind of a
team they are. They showed that, while
hurting on the offensive line and from
the loss of . running back Brandon
Miree, Pitt is not only undeserving of
all the national champion talk of the
summer, but of even having a ranking
in the top 25. ‘

More surprising than the team
almost losing ‘ to
Rutgers — and
almost losing badly
— is the way the
team is handling
wins like these.

replaced by the ﬂat A f t e r
Panthers team that Saturday’s game,
took the field defensive lineman
against N otre Dame. Claude Harriott

They failed to make adjustments and
struggled to do everything at which
they are supposed to excel.

The Panthers scored. zero points,

had only 67 yards» and two first downs
and possessed the ball for only 10 min-
utes; Rutgers, on the other hand,
scored 25 points, had 410 yards of
offense to out gain the Panthers 516-
494, possessed the ball for 20 minutes
and made 21 first downs.
_ Now, the question is being asked:
Is Rutgers that good or are the
Panthers that bad?

What should have been a blowout

said, “We played physical and gave
110 percent, but something wasn’t
right. They outcoached us in the sec-
ond half by making adjustments. We
came out and put the pressure on the
quarterback. We had some intercep-
tions. Things are getting better. We
know our mistakes and we just have to
capitalize.  It’s not a different prob-
lem [every week]. It’s the same thing.
It’s just staying focused.”

It’s good to hear a player like
Harriott recognize that something isn’t
right, that having Saturday’s game end
the way it did is cause for alarm. But

it’s distressing that the same player
also said the problems they faced
against Rutgers are the same problems
with which they’ve been dealing.

This is a team that had the poten-
tial to compete for a national champi-
onship — mistakes shouldn’t be dealt
with, they should be fixed. To hear
things like the problems affecting the
team one week are the same as inpre—
vious weeks is more than a cause for
alarm —— it’s cause for wondering
where the heads of the players and
coaching staff are.

After six games, the national‘

championship talk has evaporated, as
has 'Pitt’s ranking in the top 25. And
deservedly so. If this team can’t
destroy teams like Rutgers and Toledo
and ‘beat decidedly a team like Notre
Dame, it shouldn’t be ranked.

And for a team that might be look-
ing for a new conference when the Big
East folds — which is by far still a cer-

« tainty — they shouldn’t be looking at a

conference like the Big Ten. That’s too
lofty.

The way this team’s playing, only
Conference USA could offer the same
amount of mediocrity this team has
played with during the past few weeks.

Dante A. Ciampaglia is a sucker for
mediocre football. That’s why he
watched the Steelers.

Pitt defense has trouble containing theScarlet Knights in second half

Win, page 14

Hart found Tucker in the ﬂat and, after picking up a
block from a lineman, Tucker ran 28 yards for the first
down.

Rutgers then handed the offense over to running back
Justin Hairston.

Hairston ran the ball ﬁve times on the drive for 35
yards, including a 4-yard touchdown run. Ryan Sands’ kick
was blocked by J .J . Home and Pitt led 42-13.

The Panthers failed to pick up a ﬁrst down on their
next drive and Rutgers put together a 12 play, 70-yard drive
that ended with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Hart to
Leonard. This time, Sands extra point was good and the
Knights trailed 42-20.

Rutgers would score again in the quarter after recover-
ing a fumbled snap at Pitt’s 24-yard line. Three plays later,

Leonard plowed his way into the end zone, carrying three
Panthers with him. Rutgers tried for the two-point conver-
sion, but Hart’s pass fell incomplete.

“It’s not a different problem [every week]; it’s the same
thing,” Harriott said about the defense. “It’s just staying

focused. Guys probably took their foot off the gas a little bit '

and so we relaxed. It’s surprising that we have so many vet-
erans on our defense, but we’re still learning.”

The Panthers started the scoring on their ﬁrst drive of -

the game. Rutherford was able to ﬁnd Fitzgerald early, hit-
ting the receiver for gains of 17- and 40—yards, the second
of which put the ball at the Rutgers’ 24-yard line.

Four plays later, Walker ran untouched behind the left
side of the line for the touchdown, the ﬁrst of his Pitt career.
Abdul kicked the extra point to give Pitt the 7-0 lead.

Rutgers was able to drive down to the Pitt 37-yard line
on its ﬁrst possession, but Hairston fumbled and comer-

“Clown Prince of Pocket
Billiards”  

back Shawntae Spencer fell on the loose ball.

On the ﬁrst play, Rutherford found Fitzgerald for a 47-
yard gain, but the Panthers could not advance any farther.
Abdul came on to try a 39-yard ﬁeld goal, but the kick
sailed wide right.

“If you know [what’s wrong with Abdul], I’d like to
know,” Harris said about the kicker, who has connected on
just 4-of-10 ﬁeld goals this season. “I think that he kicked
a couple better today, in terms of how he hit the ball, but
he’s got to be more consistent.”

The Knights were unable to move the ball, and
Rutherford.moved Pitt back into Rutgers’ territory, culmi-
nating the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight
end Kris Wilson.

The offense scored four more times in the second quar-
ter, providing Pitt with enough points to hold on and pull
out the victory. '
