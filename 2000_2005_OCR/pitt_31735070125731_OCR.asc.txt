Harsh winds unleashed their
fury on the William Pitt Union lawn
yesterday, not sparing one loose
edge of a tablecloth or one ﬂier at
the volunteer fair. Not even thick

The Pitt News

Pitt junior Jenna Morasca, who will be appear-
ing in a national magazine, television show and sev-
eral upcoming pageants, certainly seems to be on
the road to fame.

Morasca, 20, will be featured in the November
issue of Stuff magazine, appearing as “college coed
of the month,” a scholarship contest in which Pitt
will be mentioned in a feature article about her.

The zoology and archaeology major competed
against other entrants for the month, and was ulti-
mately chosen as “most attractive entrant.” Along
with other monthly winners, Morasca will compete
for the $5,000 scholarship awarded to the grand
prize recipient to be announced in January or
February.

Morasca will also be competing in the upcom-
ing Miss Venus Swimwear International Model
Search, which takes place between Sept. 23 and
Sept. 30. She has already won a preliminary com-
petition in Erie, Pa., in July, where she received
about $2,000 in cash and prizes as well as an all-
expenses—paid uip to the ﬁnal competition at the
Plaza Resort and Spa in Daytona Beach, Fla.

In the national contest she will compete for a
$300,000 prize package, which includes $50,000 in
cash, a spot as a model in the Venus Swimwear cat-
alog and numerous other prizes. The pageant

involves three areas of competition including day--

time fashion wear and sportswear, swimwear, and
“after ﬁve fashion.”
“It’s kind of like a job fair,” Morasca said.

THE PITT NEWS

“Basically everyone is competing for a modeling
contract, and most of the girls do get them.”

No stranger to beauty pageants, Morasca has
already won the title of Miss Pennsylvanian
American Coed 2000 and competed in the Miss
Hawaiian Tropic Pageant.

Morasca will participate in the Miss
Pennsylvania USA Pageant, where she will com-

' pete for the chance to represent Pennsylvania in the

nationally televised Miss USA Pageant. The
pageant will take place Nov. 9 through Nov. 11.

“It can be stressful at times,” Morasca said.
“It’s deﬁnitely hectic between school, photo shoots,
and obviously, exercising in preparation for the
swimsuit pageant, but it’s deﬁnitely worth it.”

Morasca will also host local television show
called “Nightlife,” the ﬁrst episode airing Oct. 5 at
12:30 a.m. on the WB television network. The show
will feature highlights of the hottest clubs, fashions
and restaurants in Pittsburgh. Morasca will host a
segment of the show covering the Pittsburgh club
scene.

“It is tough trying to ﬁt everything in, especial-
ly with the shoots for the television show, but

school has to remain my top priority,” she said.

When Morasca began modeling, she was just
trying it out. “I just wanted to see if I could do it and
how far it would take me. It just seemed like a good
opportunity,” she said.

Morasca is new to Pitt this semester, having
transferred from Duquesne University.

“Pitt is a lot more diverse than Duquesne. I like
being around a different variety of people,” she
said. i

After the attack, student  
perceptions have changed

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
The Pitt News

A week after the attacks on the

World Trade Center, Pitt students

have already begun readjusting to
life. But that readjustment has been
far from seamless as many still
have ‘concerns about long-term
safety. , .

“I think we’re just paranoid as a
whole,” sophomore Kevin McCuc
said. ‘.‘You kinda have to be. I mean,
the whole country’s going to war.”

Many students have fears that
Pittsburgh could be a future target
for terrorism;

“This is Pittsburgh, after all,”
freshman Ryan Scacco said. “It’s a
decent-sized city.”

Freshman Nigel Foucha dis-
agreed.

, “Downtown Pittsburgh’s not
that big a target,” Foucha, a fre-
quent air traveler, said. “There are
bigger cities they could hit. It’s just
kinda freaky that they could sneak
knives and stuff through [at the air-

port].” .
Others said Pitt and its land-
marks could be in danger, particu-

larly the Cathedral of Learning.

Even mental images of terrorist-
hijacked planes crashing into the
Cathedral have been plaguing the
minds of some students. ,

“I was thinking about how big
the dust/,cloud would be,” Scacco
said.

Some students thought that
because the Cathedral means so
much to Pitt students and faculty,

the impact of an attack would be
powerful. V ~

“It’d be a good symbol, and
[terrorists are] all about symbols,”
McCue said.

Media coverage has also shown
how everyday lives are likely to be
changed. ‘

“Watch Sportscenter — you’ll
see all the security guards,” fresh-
man Rick Jorietz said, after seeing
the return of baseball and other

Counseling Center plans
to help mourning students

CHIRAG DEVASKAR
The Pitt News

Pitt’s Counseling Center will be
hosting Grief Groups on Sept. 26,
Oct. 3 and Oct. 10 for any students
who lost a loved one or whose loved
one is missing as a result of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. .

The sessions will run from 4
p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and no scheduled
appointment is necessary.

“They might feel very different
than other people,” staff. psycholo-
gist Kevin Bursley said in regard to
students who lost friends, family

members or other people important’

to ‘them as a result of the attack.

“While some people may be try-
ing to get back to normal after all
this, they lost someone important
and they’re grieving,” Bursley said,
adding that he decided to assemble
the sessions so that grieving students
could talk about what they’re going
through. 3

The sessions aim to provide
opportunity for such students to

gather information‘ regarding the
process of grieving, gain emotional
support from others who are going
through the same situation, under-
stand how others deal with their loss
and develop new and effective ways
to cope with their pain‘, Bursley said.

While Grief Group sessions are

commonly held every term to help 3

students who are dealing with per-
sonal tragedies, Bursley said he felt

that the‘ large number of people .1

killed‘ or missing as a result of the
attacks warranted conducting special
sessions. .
Bursley said some students have
already visited the Counseling
Center to share their reaction tothe
events; '
V The Grief Group sessions will be
informal, confidential and moderat-
ed by Bursley. They will be held at

the Counseling Center, located at‘

334 William Pitt Union. Students
seeking additional information can
call the Counseling-Center at 648-
7930 or visit www.pitt.edu/~coun-
sel. ‘

THE PITT NEWS

SVO hosts volunteer fair

Volunteer, page 1

adding that the same agencies come
back year after year to introduce
students to their causes.

“They’re excited to get volun-
teers from Pitt,” she said. “It bodes
well that so many organizations
want to work with Pitt students.”

Organizations at yesterday’s fair
offered everything from health-
related tasks to child tutoring and
mentoring.

Some students said they see the
volunteer fair as an opportunity to
lend a hand as well as gain experi-
ence in their field.

Mal Rajagopalah, a freshman
majoring in pre-med, attended the
fair seeking early practice in a med-
icine-related area. “I did a lot of
volunteering in high school. I want
to continue with it, and I’ll get a ﬂa-
vor or some experience in what I
plan to do,” he said.

Junior Alexis Nutter said, “My
major is child psychology and I’ll
be able to get‘ firsthand experience

working with kids before I go out
into the workforce.” -

.But not everyone in attendance
came for the fair.

The aroma of fudge brownies
and chocolate chip cookies whipped
through the air with the help of
monsoon-like winds ' enticing
passersby unaware of what was
going on.

“Free stuff made us come,” 1

junior Aaron Chaney said. “But it
all sounds kind of interesting.”

Though a few students said they
weren’t ready to volunteer their
time, they stopped by to see what’s
available to them.

“I admire people that have more
dedication than I do for their com-
munities,” sophomore Caitlyn Stuff
said.

But many students said they are
prepared to fit volunteering‘ into
their schedules, and local organiza-
tions are more than willing to
accommodate students’ schedules.

“It’s not about having time. It’s
about making time,” Chaney said.

Some still unsettled after attack

Perceptions, page 4

sports to their regular schedules.

But most said that the changes
to their mindset are subtler, but
likely to be long lasting.

“Sometimes you take for grant-
ed that your building is a big, tall
tower,” freshman Joe Everhart said.

Some have a greater awareness
of the warning signs.

“In a way, I’m more conscious,”
Scacco said, recalling the few days
after the attack. “When a plane
would ﬂy overhead, we’d all look
up. Now I’m over it, but my eyes
are still opened.”

SUCH A DEAL!

The craning of heads at passing
aircraft seems to be a common trend
among Pitt students, even’ those
who don’t feel threatened.

“You see a plane and you just
think about last Tuesday,” freshman
Josh Kerfoot said. “You really don’t
think it’s crashing.”

Other concerns focus around the
possibility of infringements on
individual rights and protections.

“I think life is changed,”
Wentling said. f‘They’re gonna be
able to put taps in our phones. Our
privacy’s changed. It’s like that
movie ‘Enemy of the State.’ Not so
much safe, just more restricted.”

Naval ﬂeet
carries 15,000
Americans to
Middle East

Deployed, page 1 1 «»

Burkholder said. “Maybe if we did
more for the Cole, this wouldn’t
have happened.” A

This is the first deployment for
many sailors.

They are heading off to fight an
enemy with no standing navy, no

I fighter planes, not even a nation to

call its own. ’Many of the 15,000
sailors and Marines aboard the bat-
tle group are eager to avenge last

,week’s terrorist’s attacks. But most

don’t.know where, when or how. .

Included in Wednesday’s
deployment are the amphibious
attack ship USS Bataan, two cruis-
ers, a destroyer, a frigate and two
attack subs. .

Three more destroyers will
soon follow, bringing the battle

~ group to 14 naval vessels capable

of carrying more than 150 planes
and helicopters.

They are armed with cruise mis-
siles, torpedoes ' and guns.
Thousands of Marines are also on
board, ready to do battle on land.

The Roosevelt _saw extensive
combat in battles against Iraq and
Bosnia. More than 4,200 sorties
ﬂew from its decks in Desert
Storm, more than from any other
carrier. __ —

No ship in the world is larger
than its 1,092 feet, more than 3 1/2
football fields long. Eighty-five
aircraft sit ready to launch.

But for‘ all its might, no one

' knows how safe the carrier is from

the new kind of ‘war being fought
against the nation.
_“They say carriers are protect-

_ ed, but airplanes ﬂew into build-
ings. Who’s -to say one’s not going

to .ﬂy into the deck.” said Shelly
Mills, 29, who came to the pier
with her two children to see off her

. Another sailor, ' Matthew A
Poorman, 29, acknowledged he was
“scared, anxious,’.’ as he said good-' .

‘bye to‘ his wife and 5-"month-"old

son dressed in a sailoris hat.

“Pm proud --to be a part of it,’’' ;

Poorman said. “To know that no
matter what the mission is, whatev-
er the mission might be, we"ll
change the course of history.”

“I don’t feel that the world will

- be the same_ after this is over.”

EDITORIAL

Can we do everything it takes?

In the week since the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we
have seen patriotism manifesting itself all
over the country.

People clamor for revenge. Within
minutes of the attack, commentators com-
pared Sept. 11, 2001, with Dec. 7, 1941 —
the day Pearl Harbor was attacked.

But unlike Pearl Harbor, we do not yet
know our enemy. Most sources now say
Osanra bin Laden, the Saudi-bom million-
aire trained by the CIAwho has since turned
against the United States and endorsed ter-

rorism, is behind the attacks.

What we do know is thatAfghanistan’s
de facto ruling group, the Taliban — which is
not recognized by the United States as that
country’s legitimate government — has
admitted harboring bin Laden.

Where and how do we seek justice?
Last week, President George W. Bush said
the terrorists themselves are not the only
legitimate targets — so are the countries har-
boring them. Assurning that bin Laden per-
petrated this act — which, at the moment, he
and the Taliban deny — then Afghanistan
would be just as responsible.

But there is a problem: Not only do we
not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate
government of Afghanistan, but it is a gov-
emrnent completely unrepresentative of the
Afghan people.

The Taliban is a radical Islamic funda-
mentalist group that came into power in
1996. Almost immediately, this government
implemented its strict interpretation of
Islamic law. What has followed in the last
ﬁve years has been a catastrophe — women
have lost their jobs and can only leave the
home with strict restrictions, Buddhist reli-
gious statues have been destroyed, at one
point the Taliban considered forcing Hindus
to wear arrnbands, Afghanistan has almost
no viable economy to speak of.

Last week, thousands of innocent civil-
ians lost their lives in a most tragic fashion.
But almost irrrrnediately, people have called
for vengeance, some saying that we should
turn Afghanistan into a parking lot.

Do we want revenge on people who

' have nothing to do with the government that

oppresses them?

Afghanistan does not harbor bin Laden,
but its oppressive government that We con-
sider illegitimate does. The Taliban is a
group, not a place. Unfortunately, that does-
n’t seem to matter to those who want instant
vengeance.

Ten years ago, we watched avidly as
die United States and its allies defeated Iraq
in a seemingly sanitary war. The American
public has since grown to expect wars to be

The American public would love a
repeat of the Gulf War. That way, we can
have our revenge —'quick, easy, with few
casualties and broadcast live on CNN. Then
we can regain our sense of security.

But as the Soviets learned in the 1980s,
conditions are different in  It is
an incredibly mountainous country. It resist-
ed Russian and British attempts to conquer
it. We should not be so arrogant to think it
would be any dilferent for us. We already
had plenty of trouble in the. jungles of
Southeast Asia. ‘

Simply bombing Afghanistan will not
root out the terrorists. To protect ourselves
in the future, we will have to commit
ground troops. Though a horrible possibili-
ty, it is a necessary action if we are to pre-
vent future attacks. We will have to capture
or kill bin Laden and overthrow the Taliban.

But it carmot stop there. The only way
to prevent attacks like last week’s from hap-
pening again is to look at why they hap-
pened. After we defeat the Taliban, we
would have to rebuild the country, restore it
to what it was before the Soviet invasion.
We would have to try to make Afghanistan
an American ally.

In 1945, we defeated Germany and
Japan. But we helped them rebuild. They
now have prosperous econonries and are

two of our greatest allies.
The same can happen with
Afghanistan

Ifwestartthis,wehavetogoallthe
way. It may be tough, it may be bloody, but
in the long run, we can prevent a catastrophe
like last Tuesday’s from ever happening
again.

Knocked off our pedestal

America, the impenetrable —-
immune from all terrorist attacks from
other nations. .

America, the almighty and all-
powerful + loved by all people across
the globe. ' L

America, the last beacon of free-
dom and hope —,— the safest haven for
all those wishing to worship and live
under the absolute least threat of dan-
ger or persecution.

These are theassertions by which
the left hemisphere of our Earth’s brain
abides. They are also the

for mourning and solidarity. You and I

have just as much claim to “sleeping”-

as any CIA, FBI or military intelligence
agent.

But there are those who are mock-
ing the United States‘ right now. And
just as with the O.J. Simpson verdict
when many faces cheered against many
more faces frozen and appalled, there
are those who are —— surprise —— jubi-
lant amidst our time of grief and dis-
may.

Not all of those in celebration have

bronze skin and rough

assumptions that have been
the basis for how we
behave around and react to
the “others” who reside on
this planet.

_ These assertions are
the‘ reason we walk with
our heads high and our
chests puffed as we mingle
among those .from other
countries — or even when

beards, either, lest we forget‘

Koresh and Ted Kaczynski.

Some of us might ask
in pure amazement, “How
could anyone in the world
be content with the travesty
heaped upon our bright and
beautiful country?”

It is precisely that type
of attitude that does not aid

we visit other countries.

Unless we’ve forgotten, though,
they are also the same principles
resented and loathed by many who
‘have never shared in the richness and
glory of those residing in the west.
Some see our pride andwealth as pre-
cursors to prophesized biblical plagues
of death and ‘oblivion doomed to visit

- us in our sleep like thieves in the night-.

To say we slept severely under-
states. matters. We were comatose.
Drunk enough  our grandeur and
blinded enough by sheer confidence to
miss a band of terrorists hijack four

’ jumbo U.S. airliners and smack‘ them

into three of our most grandiose icons
of America’s greatness. .

Please don’t mistake my being dis-
appointed and confounded with being a
sardonic smart-ass in a time that calls

/

the American image in
shielding it from the type of attacks it
suffered last Tuesday.

Whether it’s in the name of jeal-
ousy, religious conviction, political
belief or just purejhatred for anything
American, there are those who thrive
on the notion that they are the ones who
must unseat the most powerful from its
throne. . r H

We see this type of sentiment-

. exhibited from an early age. Remember
the prettiest or the wealthiest kid in

your high school?

I can recall working in a city pro-
gram with the daughter of one of the
wealthiest families in my region. I can’t’
remember whether her family’s fortune
earned her more friends or gained her

THE PITT NEWS

Thursday, September 20, 2001

In time of crisis,

What has happened to our campus? College
students, where is your signature skepticism?
When did everyone become such war-heads?

Come on people! President George W. Bush
has declared a “war on terrorism.” What does that
mean? '

If we’re lucky, a war on terrorism will be a lot
like the war on drugs: expensive, more ‘
harmful than helpful and completely
ineffective. If we’re not lucky, a war on.
terrorism will be a lot like Vietnam:
long, bloody, impossible to win and
completely ineffective. -

Let’s get one thing straight. We have
not declared a war on terrorism. If’ we

on fundamental Islamic terrorism in
Afghanistan. We cannot win a war in

ism. Our government is still owned by insurance
and drug companies, Wal-Mart, Starbucks and the
NRA. Two weeks ago, most of my fellow college
students were equally as aware of this as I am.

Now everyone seems to be carrying around an
American ﬂag. People are proclaiming that we
must fight a war to stop attacks on America.

Terrorism should of course be.
fought, but not by going to war. It
should be fought the same way it has
always been fought: through govern-
ment intelligence agencies.

They’ve actually done an amazing
job so far preventing terrorist attacks,
considering that a ridiculous number of
countries in the world despise the
United States. Attempts at terrorism
will never stop. All the United States
can do is try to be less horribly oppres-.

 

Afghanistan.

There is a sudden resurgence of patriotism that
didn’t exist two weeks ago. It was certainly not
cool to love America two weeks ago.

I consider myself a patriot. A patriot is some-
one who does whatever he or she can do to make
the country better. I understand that this country
has enabled me to have a ridiculously high stan-
dard of living, and I am grateful for every blessin

V sive and make our intelligence agen-
cies as tight as possible.

People forget that war is not noble. War is
degrading. I do not consider someone who is will-
ing to blindly fight for his or her country nobler
than someone who refuses. - L

It is noble to investigate and find out whatis
right for you and fight for that, but it is not noble
to simply fight a war because our government pro-

deaths should not be used as fodder for propagan-

. da and as fodder for war. The national anthem

should not be used to memorialize them; they_ did

not die for our country. They died trying to live, .

trying to make a living, just going about their day.
That is a terrible V tragedy. It is disrespectful to
those people when we treat them like the first casu-
alties of a war they never got any chance to com-
ment on. - T

It is sick that so many people will jump at any“
chance for violence to be acceptable. There is graf-
fiti right outside St. Paul’s Cathedral on Fifth ‘I
Avenue and Craig Street that says “Kill bin Ladin.”
The person who wrote that may very well have
walked out of mass and scrawled those violent
Words. That is sick. That person surely only knows
that he is supposed to hate Osama bin Ladin
because the news and the government told him so.

I personally have no idea whether bin Ladin is

, responsible for the attacks and am not ready to kill

over it. Why should I suddenly begin to trust what
the government tells me without proof? I didn’t
trust the government two weeks ago. ,

This war would not be noble. Ipdo not wish to
fight it and I will not pretend I do. .My friends’
lives are worth more than this war. ‘

Columnist Melissa ‘Balick would like to thank

I’ve received.

But the U.S. government still oppresses other
governments. We still engage in cultural imperial-

' claims a “war on terrorism.”
I am very sorry for the people who died in the
World Trade Center and in the Pentagon. But their

more enemies. I do remember, though,
that when she got jumped by a bunch of
girls — ironically after a Martin Luther
King peaceful protest conference —
her snobby attitude proved to ‘be no
guard for her. I -

I’m by no means suggesting that
this girl, or America for that matter,
asked for the damage they both
received. No one deserves to be
attacked or viliﬁed for his or her eco-
nomic status. Most of us had nothing to
do with the fact that we were born into
the wealthiest nation.

What I’m saying is that we don’t

"help ourselves any when we hide

behind pillars of conceit and pomp.
People from my neighborhood
back home know, if they have money,
they shouldn’t constantly ﬂash» their
jewels and wave their cash rolls
around. They know that this will even-
tually get them robbed or, worse, killed.
Likewise, people in my neighbor-
hood don’t grow a new arrogant per-
sona as their bank account increases
because history has shown us that those
upon whom we may look condescend-
ingly will disown us and begin to hate

us.
Most importantly they will kill
over those very same sentiments,
regardless as to how petty we makethat
out to be. I

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

    

PG 1

Woes continue for men’s soccer 

MATT MILOSZEWSKI
Staff Writer

Wins have been difficult to come
by for the Pitt men’s soccer team this
season, and troubles continued to
plague the team last night as it lost to
West Virginia 2-0 in Morgantown,
W.Va. ,

The Panthers, in their first game
since playing in the Nike‘ Classic in
Alabama on Sept. 8 and 9, suffered
their fourth loss of the season. The
Panthers’ third consecutive loss drops
them to 1-4 overall and 0-2 in the Big
East.

This appears to be a rebuilding
year for the Panthers, who had a great
start last year, opening the season at 6-
0. Pitt ﬁnished the season 13-5 overall
and 7-5 in the Big East for one of the
team’s best seasons ever, being nation-
ally ranked throughout the year and at
one point as high as ninth in the
nation.

The Mountaineers struck early and
controlled most of the first half.

HUGH BURGOON/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

The Pitt men’s soccer team is just 1-4 early on_ this season after losing to West
Virginia. The lone win was a 3-0 victory over»St. Francis (above).

\a

recorded his first career shutout.

West Virginia finished the game
with 17 shots compared to just eight
by Pitt. The Mountaineers also com-
mitted more fouls, 22-18, but it was
not a hindrance for the team.

The game at Mountaineer Soccer
Complex was the conference opener

West Virginia improves to 3-2 overall
and 1-0 in Big East play. The
Mountaineers will I play again on
Saturday when they host No.11 Seton
Hall at 2:30.p.m.~

Pitt head coach,Joe Luxbacher and
his squad return to action this Sunday
in Pittsburgh at Quaker Valley High
School. The game will begin at 1 p.m.
as the Panthers look to get back in the
win column against Big East opponent
Villanova. The Panthers hope to get»

freshman Marco Carrizoles, sopho-
more Clay Haﬂich and senior Peter
Veltri.

Panthers had two games canceled, the

for the Mountaineers. With the win, '

' some goals outof leading scorers ,-

Because of last week’s tragedy, the A

Freshman Nick Burke scored the first
goal of his career, and it turned out to
be the game winner with 5:44 to play
in the first half. Burke took a pass from
Roberto D’Uillse and beat Panther
goaltender Justin Gaul for the tally.
Gaul finished the game with six saves.

The second half looked to be more '

promising for Pitt, with the Panthers
controlling most of the action. But the
Panthers’ comeback attempt was qut

short when senior Chin Orih scored his ‘

third goal of the year with only 26 sec-
onds remaining. .

Although the comeback failed, the
Panthers did have some chances. Pitt

_ took eight shots, four of which were on
goal, and forced four corner kicks-

against the Mountaineers. ~ West
Virginia sophomore goalie Chris
McKinney made four saves and

first of which was with Duquesne and
the second with Georgetown. As of
yet, there is no makeup date set for the
Panthers and Dukes. The Big East con-
ference game with Georgetown has
been rescheduled for Nov. 6 in
Washington, D.C' ‘

Never too old tobea giddy kid ata ball game  

Some people may think that autograph col-
lecting is just for kids, but I disagree.

I tend to get to the ballpark when the gates
open and make my way down to the ’

embarrassed that I was acting like a 5-year-old.

I waited somewhat impatiently as I leaned
over the railing to_ ‘scope out where

railing that holds back the mob of excit-
ed fans from the field. This was the
case on Monday night when my best
friend Shannon and I went to the
Mets/Pirates game.

I am a die—hard Mets fan and can’t
help feeling giddy when I go to a game.
I was wearing my old, very worn Todd
Hundley jersey that was signed before

by Al Leiter and former Met Turk sponfg vlgw

Wendell. But I forgot to bring a marker,

rowing” the one I used to sign a banner

landed a signature when Mark
Johnson came over. Later, Jerrod
Riggan signed a few balls but I did-
n’t want him to sign my_ jersey
because, wel1,‘he sucks. .

I maneuvered my way closer to
the dugout where I saw Bruce Chen
"and prepared by taking off my jersey
(1 had a tank top on underneath). A
guy standing next to me said, “Hey
Bruce, you better sign an autograph
for her, she’s taking her clothes off

for the people of New York.

I quickly decided that would be wrong and
once inside the stadium, Shannon bought me a
$3 Pirates marker like a parent would buy for his
or her kid. I handed her my pocketbook and
ﬂeece that I had been carrying and bounded

He came over to sign my jersey and two pho-

tographers followed, snapping pictures ‘ as
Shannon told him, “Hey, if I give you her num-
ber will you take her on a date?”

He just laughed.

I have a wide assortment of autographs that
I’ve gotten at games over the years. Usually I’m
not too" picky, but I do have a few guys suchas

Some of the other John Hancocks I boast are .

Tar Heels no match for tough Florida State

After a week without picks, the
Compulsive Corner is back. I suc-
cessfully picked Georgia Tech and
South Florida to cover two weeks
ago, but Army and Vanderbilt
screwed me over by tacking on
points at the end of their games.

So after two weeks of play I
have a 5-4 record against the spread
and an 8-1 record straight up,
although some of those games
include no‘-brainers such as the
Georgia Tech win over Navy.
Although 5-4 isn’t extraordinary,
anytime you’re batting over .500,
you’re making a little loot.

Florida State (-17) at North

Carolina

After _the death of
DeVaughn Darling and with
defensive end Eric Powell in
the hospital in stable condi-
tion after being shot, the
Seminoles have a lot to play
for this weekend at ‘Chapel

by Kenneth Paul

Hill.

Counted out of the national
championship since before the sea-
son even started, Florida State has
been dominating as it beat Duke 55-
13 and a tough Alabama-
Birmingham team 29-7.

 

How would you like to

play three of your first four‘ games
against Oklahoma, Texas and
Florida State? Well North Carolina
(0-4) faces another shellacking this
week it hosts the Seminoles.

tions.

Iowa State at Ohio (-'2)

Anytime I see a Mid-American
Conference team favored over a Big
12 team, my gut tells me to place a
call and fast. '

Iowa State (1-0), the team that

beat Pitt in the Insight.com Bowl

last season, is coming off of a 45-0
destruction of lowly Northern Iowa.

The big play guy on this team is‘

senior tailback ‘Ennis Haywood,
who had 20 carries for 105 yards
two touchdowns in the
Cyclones’ first game. . .

. Cyclones quarterback Seneca
Wallace doesnot make too many

mistakes, and he should pick apart

Ohio, a team that Iowa State defeat-
ed last year 25-15.

Ohio (0-2) lost at West Virginia
and at Akron. Make a note to your-

self, always bet against a team that

has lost to Akron. West Virginia
beat ‘em soundly, 20-3, and Ohio

‘ quarterback Dontrell Jackson was _'

quite ineffective as he threw the

ball just eight times. ' ~

Virginia Tech (-27 1/2) at ‘Rutgers .

Patemo emotional over attacks

ADAM GORNEY
. Daily Collegian

Joe Patemo had tears in his eyes
when he addressed the Penn State foot-

.ball team after the terrorist attacks in
.New York and Washington, D.C., last

week. _

For a man who has seen the
tragedies of World War II, John F.
Kennedy’s assassination, and the rest of
America’s tribulations for more than 70
years, Patemo was particularly emo-
tional, players said.

N Many former players worked in the
World Trade Center and although most
are accounted for, Paterno said it is. still
unclear whether former Nittany Lions
were in or near the World Trade Center
during the attack.

But Patemo’s closest tie to New
York City is Brooklyn, his childhood
home. Paterno recalled his memories of
the World Trade Center, going to church
and having relatives work in
Manhattan. .

“I’m having a very, very diﬁicult
time,” Patemo said at his weekly news
conference. “All of my background is
right around the World Trade Center.”

An emotional Patemo recalled
memories of Fulton and 32nd streets

and said he has walked the streets of
downtown Manhattan many times.

Patemo recalled two other events in
his lifetime that affected him as much as
the terrorist attacks did last week. The
74-year-old coach said he remembered
a newsvbulletin informing the country
that Pearl Harbor was under attack and
vividly recalls his memories after
President Kennedy was assassinated.

Patemo said former Penn State
football coach Rip Engle informed
everyone on the practice field that
Kennedy had been killed. He added
Engle was a conservative Republican
and thought the Kennedy family was
arrogant, but it was a moment Patemo
will never forget.

“He could not hold back the emo-
tion, and he didn’t even like Kennedy,”
Patemo said. “He thought they were
arrogant, but he“'was so moved.”

And now it’s Patemo’s moment to
feel that same gut-wrenching emotion.
The terrorists that smashed two air-
planes into the World Trade Center
attacked more than just New York City.
They attacked a place Patemo once
called home. ' i '

“He was in an emotional crisis,”
middle linebacker Shamar Finney said.
“He told us about the importance of life.

 
   
 

  

 

He told the guys football isn’t every-
thing. He couldn’t get a lot of words
ou .” o
Patemo said he ﬁrst learned about
the incident while he was in a meeting
with his coordinators as former Lions
quarterback Mike McQueary burst into
the room to inform the coaches that the
World Trace Center was being attacked.
The coach said he didn’t take

McQueary seriously and went back to V

work, but as other coaches interrupted
the meeting and told Patemo to watch
the television, he was stunned.
4 He told the team last week while it
was still being considered whether or
not Penn State would play Virginia that
he'wouldn’t be able to coach. His emo-
tions and mindset wasn’t on football.

But the Lions have to get past the
tragedy that has alfected some of their
former players and especially their
coach. Penn State must focus on open-
ing its Big Ten‘ schedule against
Wisconsin on Saturday and continuing
its season.

“He talked to us like he was our '

father,” F inney said of Patemo. “When
you see an emotional coach, you knew
something was wrong. He talked about
calling our families and just telling
them that you love them.”

Still enjoying the art of autograph collecting

Column, page 16

but we were born in the same hospi-
tal. Before the game Leiter was out
on the field, and my dad yelled,
“Hey Al, how about an autograph
for some kids from Jersey?” So
Leiter turned around and said,
“How about a ball?” and tossed one
to us. He later signed it.

For my_l6th birthday I went to a
Mets/Phillies game in Philadelphia.
It was a doubleheader, and in the
second game the Mets were being
beaten so badly that my brother and
I went down by the bullpen to get

some autographs. — _

Hundley was down there
because he had caught the first
game, and people were throwing
down balls and other random
objects for him to sign. I threw
down what I thought was my ball,
but it turns out it was my brother’s
and so he insisted that he should
keep it. I was pretty mad.

I was in Detroit six years ago
when the Tigers were playing the
Angels, whose closer at the time
was Lee Smith. He was more than
happy to fulfill our request —— he

started signing.

‘But the baseball autograph in
my collection that I am most proud
of would be a personalized card
signed by Mike Piazza in. 1995. I
had bought a book-that had the
home addresses of many of the
players in the major leagues, and I
had sent the card to him in the off-
season. -

I was so proud of that card that
I brought it to school and showed
everyone. And I mean everyone.

I also obtainedia number of
other autographs that way, but of
course not everyone isnice enough

 

to write'back.‘Another good method
is sending cards to the players in
spring training. _ '

This is how I came into posses-
sion’ of cards signed by Jim
Edmonds, J.T. Snow and a few oth-
ers 'I’m struggling to remember.
Among those to whom I’ have sent
cards and never heard from again
are Kirby Puckett and sadly enough,
Hundley. '

My card of Cal Ripken Jr. was
sent back with an Orioles sticker
and apologetic note saying that he
receives too many items to auto-
graph.

I haven’t bought an updated
issue of that address book, but you
can guarantee that I’ll still be out at

the ballparks, lined up against the ~

railings with all of the kids.

The Hokies are 2-0 after crush-

Connecticut 52-10. If you do the
math, they’ve beat their first two
opponents by a total of 83-10, and
Rutgers is not much of a step up
from either of those teams.

More bad news for Rutgers. Not
only do the Hokies have a hot quar-

Arkansas at Alabama (-91/2)
Alabama burned me two weeks
ago when they were favored by 10

only escaped with a 12-9 win. 0
Arkansas is coming off of a 13-
3 loss to Tennessee, which could be
looked at as some kind of moral
victory considering Tennessee’s tal-
ent. The Razorbacks’ defense is a
team that can cause a lot of prob-
lems on defense. Alabama’s defense

can’t boast —- it gave up 143 rush-.

ing yards and 253 passing yards to
Vandy. ‘
Alabama has not scored a rush-

ing touchdown yet this season, and 1
"Arkansas has only given up two

touchdowns all season. If you can-
not score, it makes it pretty tough to
win by 10. Arkansas will at least

, Auburn is making its first trip

’ north of the Mason—Dixon line in

almost 60 years when it goes to
Syracuse this Saturday. Auburn is
comingoff of a big win over
Mississippi, and Syracuse, a two-

point favorite, is having a lot of ‘

problems on offense.

Two other games to-keep an eye
on are Rice at Nebraska and Kent '

State at West Virginia. Nebraska
is‘a_ 35 1/2-point favorite at Lincoln
after a smashing of Notre Dame.
West Virginia is a young team who
is favored by 27 1/2 points. That’s a
lot to handle. The team did not look

impressive over Ohio and was beat— ,

en badly by Boston College, but

then again, Kent State is in the Mid- ,

Ever wanted to be a square?

You thought it was a bad thing to be square. Here's your chance to change
your mind. Hollywood Squares and the Pitt Program Council are hosting a S
college student contestant search on Monday, September 24. Bring yourPitt
student ID to one of two 75—person tryouts (comprised of people chosen in a
random drawing) in the WPU Lower Lounge, the first at 1pm and the second
at 4pm. Those who pass will move on to a mock game. Those who make
the out will then be eligible to participate in the Hollywood Squares college
game. Just goes to show that sometimes even squares can be cool. ‘
