Raising the ar since 1906

VOLUME IVC NUMBER 21

Senior Robyn Ostach, and sophomores Farrah Segal and Alissa Krutoff look at a photograph album at
Meet the Greeks last night, where fraternities and sororities gathered in the Union to recruit new members.

Friendly fraternization

Students attend Meet the Greeks event to
find out what Pitt’s Greek life has to offer

REBECCA HUDOCK
Staff Writer

The area in front of the Zeta Beta Tau table
was still empty as 8:30 p.m. rolled around. _,

“I have four guys wandering around here
somewhere. Right now we’re still really unorga-
nized,” said Rick Mallard,’president of ZBT.

What the four ZBT brothers were looking for
was the same thing representatives from all of
the campus sororities and fraternities were look-
ing for: potential members.

Meet the Greeks, held in the William Pitt
Union from 8 to 10 p.m. last night, was an oppor-
tunity for anyone, from incoming freshmen to
transfer students, to shop around and see what
each group has to offer.

And the people who were searching for their
perfect group were as diverse as the Greek com-
munity itself. v

As the night began, men and women separat-
ed‘ and headed into the Assembly Room and

Ballroom, respectively, where delegates from
each chapter schmoozed with prospective mem-
bers in front of tables adorned with trophies, ban-
ners and other awards.

But the scene in the two rooms was anything
but similar. While approximately 75 men wan-
dered- from table to table in the Assembly Room,
the Ballroom was buzzing with the voices of
hundreds of girls.

“Wow, it sounds like a henhouse,” said
transfer student Gabe Painton as he walked into
the room. . '

The massive volume of women obscured the
view of the accumulated awards on each table.

In the middle of the chaos stood Erin
Thomas, a . . visiting student from Sussex,
England. But unlike most of the women there,
she had no intention of rushing.

“I think they should have fraternity mascots
so I can just sit there and drink beer and party,”

Pitt to fans:
Penn State
cheer sucks

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

It’s taken a semester for students to feel the effects of a decision
athletic director Steve Pederson made last spring.

The decision was to cut the portion of Pitt’s ﬁght song during
which students are supposed to chant “Fight Pitt ﬁght, ﬁght Pitt
ﬁght, V-I-C—T-O—R—Y” because of its more_ recent manifestations.

Rather than the traditional chant, a vocal majority of students
replaces the reﬁain with “Penn State sucks, Penn State sucks, P-E-
N-N-S-T-sucks” during the ﬁght song.

Jack Anderson, director of Pitt’s marching band, said Pederson
made the decision last spring before basketball season began. .

Athletic department spokesman E.J. Borghetri said the decision
was made speciﬁcally to omit the “unfortunate vulgarity.”

The students’ version of the ﬁght song, he said, “is not repre-
sentative of a ﬁrst-class institution.”

He added that the “Penn State sucks” chant is unsportsmanlike.

Senior Max Smith, a triple history, English literature and
English writing major, disagreed.

“It’s the one tradition we have,” he said of the song. “It uniﬁes
the schoo .”

Anderson-said the football team and athletic department have
been working for some time to convince students to give up the
“Penn State sucks” chant

Borghetli echoed this sentiment, reporting that the department
gets “countless” complaints every year about the offensive nature of
the alternative chant

“I have a feeling there’s gonna be a lot of positive feedbac ” he
said of Pederson’s decision. “Vulgarity is a tradition we don’t need.”

Borghetri was unaware of any depanment initiatives to replace
the chant wiﬂr new words or to re—work the ﬁght song to include a
new chorus. But he said the department and football team alike both
encourage a “loud, active student body.”

“It all has to be done within a framework of good sportsman-
ship,” he said , . ’

Student Government Board President Jeﬁ Alex was similarly
unaware of any board projects to replace or modify the song. He said
the board will focus instead on increasing the number of student
seats for next year’s season.

“As a student,” he said of the chant, “that saying will always be
in my heart. I see the tradition from a personal standpoint.”

But, he conceded, “We [had] the ﬁnal say in the competition
with Penn State ... now it’s time to focus on this year.” ‘

Alex Alspach, assistant director of Pitt’s marching band, was
also unaware of any band plans to work around the omission.

“I don’t know if anything else will come along to replace it,” he
said.

University spokesman Robert Hill failed to retum phone calls
on the matter.

Rolling in it

Social work dean boasts  
$20 million in 20 days    

«SHANNON MCLAUGI-ILIN
Editor in Chief

Larry Davis has been the dean of
Pitt’s School of Social Work for just
20 days, and already the school is $20
million richer.

“That’s a million dollars a day,”
Davis said at a press conference yes-
terday, announcing one of the largest
grants awarded to Pitt in the
University’s history.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
also present for the announcement,
encouraged Davis to keep up the
tempo.

“You’ve gotta maintain this pace,
month after month after month,” the
chancellor joked.

Nordenberg announced first that
the School of Social Work had
received the $20.5 million grant from
the Pennsylvania Department of
Public Welfare and the United States
Administration for Children and
Families. The money will underwrite
the ﬁrst of a three-year statewide edu-
cation and planning program for pub-
lic child welfare. '

“[This grant] cements Pitt’s place
as the home of one of the nation’s
leading social work [programs],”
Nordenberg said.

The funds provided by the grant
will enable education and equipment
for students at 15 other Pennsylvania
universities, and will benefit children
and workers in all 67 Pennsylvania

counties, according to Nordenberg.
Edward Sites, a professor in the

School of Social Work, said the grant

money will fund five specific pro-

grams. The Child Welfare Education

for Leadership provides graduate pro-
fessional education for current
Pennsylvania county child welfare
agencies employees. Graduates from
this program have an 87 percent reten-
tion rate on the job.

The money will also fund a new
undergraduate version of the CWEL
program called Child Welfare
Education for Baccalaureates. This
training will be available at 14 univer-
sities statewide.

Laws require pre-service and in-
service training for nearly every child
welfare worker, and grant money will
also be siphoned to fund the necessary
Competency—Based Training and
Certification Program. A

Money will also go toward sup-
porting agencies that guide 18-year-
olds into independent living and out of
substitute families or group homes, as
well as a program to fund adequate
training for Pennsylvania’s extensive
information network on child welfare
cases.

“This is not a matter of the
University getting fat from grants,”
Sites said, stressing that students will
benefit most from the grant.

Nordenberg agreed.

“We will save and enhance chil-
dren’s lives,” he said.

Japan stops short of formal apology to
WWII POWs ' ,

SAN FRANCISCO — The foreign
ministerof Japan stopped short of issuing a
fonnal apology Saturday to thousands of
American prisoners of war for the suffering
they endured during World War I] at the
hands of the Japanese.

The Japanese media had reported a day
earlier that Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka
planned to apologize when she appeared at a

. ceremony marldng the 50th anniversary of

the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which oﬂi-
cially ended the state of war between the
United States and Japan. .
Instead, Tanaka took an incremental
step forward in the ongoing process of

‘ Japanese atonement for its actions before

and during ﬂie deadliest war in history.

“The war has left an incurable scar on
many people, including fonner prisoners of
war,” Tanaka said.

In the history of Japanese apologies for
wartime aggression, scholars and historians
said Saturday they do not believe that the
government has ever singled out prisoners of
war.

Anti-abortion groups hope
to rattle Capitol Hill

To persuade the Senate to
support an anti-abortion nominee when the
pivotal Supreme Court seat becomes avail-
able, a coalition of conservative groups is

delivering more than 20,000 baby rattles to '

Capitol Hill oﬂices. The slogan is “Shake
the nation back to life!”

The rattle is intended as “a noisy
reminder of the little ones who, because of

C abortion, will never live, love or laugh on

this earth,” organizers said

The campaign is accompanied by a
singsong television commercial featuring
frolicking toddlers who cry and disappear
when the Supreme Court approves legal
abortion.

New Patriot missile already has loyal fans

WASHINGTON —— From its ﬁrst ﬁery
launch 10 years ago during the Persian Gull
War, the Patriot antimissile system has been
tailed by controversy.

To admirers it was the hero “Scud
buster” that shielded U.S. troops ﬁom Iraqi
terror missiles; to critics, it was a hyped hard-
warethatmissedfarmorewarheadsthanit
destroyed. '

This month, the ﬁrst units of a new
Patriot missile will be delivered from an
Arkansas assembly plant to an Army air
defense battalion at Fort Bliss, Texas.

The new system has won wide praise
for its ability to protect troops ﬁom short-
range missiles, and some defense oﬂicials
said that after half a century of missile
defense research it is America’s first effec-
tive antimissile system.

Yet on the larger missile defense issue
—' whether the. United States should spend
billions on a system to protect the entire
country from longer-range missiles — it is
already clear that the new Patriot will be no
less controversial than ﬂue old. i

Advocates already offer it as proof that
the Pentagon can succeed at the much more
challenging job of dealing with high-speed,
long-range missiles.

Critics, likewise, hold it out as evidence
that such an effort will be considerably more
costly, diﬂicult and time-consunring than
advocates admit.

Some who attended, like freshman
Emily Avakian, said she enjoyed the
night of socializing but quickly

became befuddled by the number of
people and groups.
“It’s really overwhelming,”

Avakian said. “I’m not really good

with names, so I had a problem trying

to differentiate between all the groups
and the girls. Honestly, right now,
most of them seem the same.”

Avakian said she is still learning
all the names of her suitemates. _.

The atmosphere in the Assembly
Room was more subdued. But like
many of the women, many of the men

were not clued in to what they wanted men who will get involved and stay

in a fraternity.

“Penn State sucks, Penn State sucks,
P-E-N—N-S-T SUCKS!”

Sound familiar? If you’re a freshman,
it probably doesn’t. But if you’re an upper-
classman, you’re probably wondering
where it went.

Last year, the student section at foot-
ball games reverberated with this chant
every time the band played the ﬁght song.

The ﬁght song even has a part incor-
porated into it speciﬁcally for chanting.

That is, until this year.

This year, that part of the song is omit-
ted. Some still use this occasion to vocalize
their feelings about the school in the middle
of the state, but most just stand — or sit —
confused.

Some are apt to blame the band. But as
it turns out, the band was simply acting
under orders from the University.

The administration brags about how
each incoming class is supposedly smarter,
then doesn’t give students any credit.

Yes,- we know that the rivalry with
Penn State is over until at least 2008. But
that doesn’t mean we still don’t think Penn
State sucks. Considering the rivalry’s death
is J oePa’s fault, we have all the more reason
to chant.

Besides, it’s not like we’re the only
school that yells against other schools — in
fact, Penn State itself used to say, “Pitt is
shit!”

The administration has made a con-

P-L—E—A-S—E let us cheer

certed effort to attract larger crowds to col-
lege football games. But as laudable as this
goal is, it should not come at the expense of
the college atmosphere prevailing at col-
lege football games. College is not Disney
World, and college football games should
not be either.

Even Steelers games are known for
their rowdiness. Why should ours be so dif-
fercnt?

A reminder: We’re still the people the
University serves. We’re also the ones deal-
ing with the “What ﬂie hell happened
Saturday? South Florida has defeated how
many Division I—A teams?” questions from
our friends and relatives.

The “Penn State sucks” slogan is deﬁ-
nitely rough around the edges, but so is the
average Pitt student. Vlfithout the chants,
without the noise, without the standing, col-
lege football just isn’t the same.

If the administration won’t give us
credit to know that the rivalry is over, it
should at least give us an alternative.
Maybe someone should reinvent the ﬁght
song. Maybe a contest to name a new chant
or song would work Just give us some-
thing. »
First they took away our stadium. Then
at the new stadium, they didn’t allow us to
stand. Now we’re "not even allowed to
chant something that’s become a tradition

My fellow patriots: It is time for

of the evil scraping sensation that
had plagued me all last year.

Like many college students, the
thought of growing up and becoming: a
“real” person has very little appeal to
me. The question “What do you want to
do?” generally elicits either a shrug or an
attempt to create some sort of plausible
cover story. ‘

But I’ve finally ﬁgured it out: What
I want most to be when I grow up is old.

Here’s why I think “old woman” is
the perfect profession for me. I really
cannot imagine going into an ofﬁce
everymorning, doing some sort of work

- for a whole day and then going home.

I have no idea what that work would
be or what would possibly prevent me
from getting so bored with it . that I
would not end up poking holes in my
skull for fun. "

But old people can get up any time

they want and then stay in arobe and

slippers until noon or later. And since
old people do not need as much sleep,
waking up early is not the excruciating-
ly painful experience it is for most col-
lege students.

University calls “toilet paper.”

This bottom-of-the-line, cheap,
bastardized version of what I’ve
always considered toilet paper to be
—— a baby’s face — has caused an
epidemic around campus.

I strolled into Hillman Library

just the other day only to see every.

student there with a hemorrhoid pil-
low. This kind of cruel treatment on
the student body’s butt region must
stop immediately.

Upon further research, I found
that EcoSoft is 100 percent recycled
paper. _

But it.feels more like EcoSoft is
actually old newspapers pasted

Pitt will put Saturday’s loss to South Florida in the past and prepare to face
Alabama-Birmingham this weekend at Heinz Field.

Last week’s game is over.
The‘ score is in, and now it’s time to
move on, according to head coach
Walt Harris.

“I really don’t want to spend a
lot of time talking about last week,”
Harris said at his weekly press con-
ference. “I think last week was a
difficult day for all of us. I know

we can perform better and that’s‘our

task.”

~ Saturday’s 35-26 defeat by
South Florida was Pitt’s first loss of
the season and it brought up the
question about high expectations
for the Panthers this season. Is this
season a total loss now or can Pitt

regain its confidence? According to
Harris, high expectations ”were

“I’m not a part of expectations,”
Harris said. “We just go out there to
win every game.” i A

After the loss, questions also :

arose about who was to blame for
the loss. Was it a missed extra
point? Was it the inability of the

Cross country dominates in first meet

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Last year at this time, a small-
numbered Pitt women’s cross coun-
try team wasn’t much of a match for
the likes of Duquesne and St.
Francis College over the hills and
through the’ woods of Schenley
Park. _

But this year, the team added
some freshmen with credentials and
got back senior Amanda Schmidt,
who’s completely 8 recovered from
leg injuries. A e

What those additions and
returns summed up to was a 7-0
record for the women’s team
Saturday at the Duquesne Quad
Meet in Schenley Park.

Pitt beat cross-town rival
Duquesne along with St. Francis,
Robert Morris, Carnegie Mellon,
Wheeling Jesuit, Monmouth and
Niagara.

“The women started a new era
here today against some ranked
teams in the Mid-East Region,” said

V ; . . . , .

. : ; , . . . . . . ,

. . I . , / . . . . . . ,

..r ; . . . . .,

head coach Waddie Freeman. .

Leading the way was Schmidt,
who was never really challenged in
the 5,000-meter race. Every time
she appeared out of the foliage, her
lead had increased slightly, and her
winning time was 18 minutes, 3
seconds.

“We’ve got a whole new
Amanda Schmidt this year,”
Freeman said. “Her time was proba-
bly one of the best ever on this
course.” '

“We all felt good coming in,”
said Schmidt, whose time was a
personal best by over a minute. “I
just tried to get out strong, but I was
never really behind anybody.”

The only other runners to put up
a fight against Schmidt were her
new teammates, freshmen Lauren
Shaffer and Maureen McCandless,.
who finished second and third
respectively, giving Pitt a sweep of
the top spots and a stranglehold on
the scoring.

Shaffer, a graduate from nearby
West Allegheny and the reigning

state cross country champion, fin-
ished with a time of 18:28.
McCandless, the runner—up at the
state cross country championship
from Nazareth Academy . in»
Philadelphia, finished at 18:37.

“Those two don’t have any
fear,” Freeman said. “They don’t
even think about being freshmen.
They just stepped up big.”

Sophomore Dawn Hilgert
improved her time by 45 seconds
from last year, coming in at 19:21,
and freshman Mary Zettl finished at
19:53 to round out Pitt’s top five.

“Mary actually fell down during
the race and got back up and ﬁn-
ished strong,” Freeman said of the
Pittsburgh native from Thomas
Jefferson. “You can’t get any
tougher than that.” _

So out of the top five for the
women, there ‘ were two huge
improvements and three first-timers
who finished big, givingsome sub-
stance to Freeman"s prediction .a
week ago that this team could be
something special in the Big East

this year. - _

“I think our team has a chance
to improve a lot in the Big East,”
Schmidt said; “This is the best cross
country we’ve had in a long time.”

The women’s act was a hard one
to follow, but the men went 5-2 -and
had some bright spots.

The best among them was
sophomore Dan Hull who finished
with a time of 22:33 on the 10-l<ilo-
meter course.

‘.‘Dan ran his best and he
stepped up big,” Freeman said. 

V Freshman Nick Westerman from
Cincinnati was in an all-out sprint
for the last 200 meters of the irace,
caught a lot of people, and was the
second runner to cross the line for
Pitt at 22:57.

; Sophomore Mike Diano got off
to a bit of a rocky start to the sea-
son, ﬁnishing at 23:02. Freshmen
Darrell Curtis and Jeryl_,Wilborn
finished at 23:11 and 23:45, respec-
tively.

Pitt volleyball team as it played
three matches in the Michigan Pepsi
Challenge but couldn’t, pick up a
victory. ' .
, The Panthers fell to Michigan,
Georgia and Eastern Michigan to
drop to ;2-5 on the season. But there
was one.- bright spot as sophomore
Wendy Hatlestad was named to the
All-Tournament team.

Pitt vs. Michigan
Pitt began play Friday night
against the Wolverines but fell in
three games by scores of 30-18, 30-
20 and 30-27. Hatlestad had 16 kills
while sophomore outside hitter
April Puzauskas recorded 10 digs
for the Panthers.

tributed 27 assists but it was not
enough to overtake Michigan, who
received a double-double from
Jennifer Gandolph with 10 kills and
10 digs.
Chantel Reedus and Katrina
‘Lehman also reached double digits
in kills’ for the Wolverines while
Erin Moore chipped in with 10 digs.
The win was Michigan’s first of the
season as the team improved to 1-3
before a crowd of 783 at Cliff Keen
Arena in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Pitt vs. Georgia V

In their second matchup of the
tournament, the Panthers faced an
undefeated Georgia team who
entered Saturday’s play at 4-0. Pitt
took the first game 30-16, but the
Lady Dogs fought back to take the
next two games 30-19 andp30-23.
The Panthers answered with a nar-
row‘30-28 win but ‘dropped the fifth

game 15-13 to suffer another
defeat.

Puzauskas led Pitt witha dou-
ble-double, recording 14 digs and
10 kills, while Hatlestad con-
tributed a match-high 29 kills and
Norris had 55 assists.

IMelissa Whaley and Lindsey
Macke also contributed to the
defense, recording 18 and 12 digs,
respectively. .

Stacy Bueger picked up 20 kills
and Luresa Forsythe added 12 digs

to lead the Lady Dogs.

"Pitt vs. Eastern Michigan

Eastern Michigan opened the
match by taking the first two games
from the Panthers by scores of 30-
21 and 30-26, but Pitt fought back
to claim the next two games and
stay alive with victories of 30-17
and 30-22.

But the Panthers couldn’t keep

pace and ultimately dropped the
final game 15-9, suffering its third

defeat of the tournament.

Four Pitt players registered dou-
ble figures in kills, led by Hatlestad
with 19. Puzauskas added 15 while

the UPMC practice facilities to
watch hours of tape. More players
came on Sunday, and another
unnamed offensive player apolo-
gized to his teammates for his
responsibility in the loss.

“We had a wake-up call,” Harris
said. “It’s a team game and all three
phases must be clicking.”

Harris also reflected on the per-
formance of specific players. He is
convinced that the running backs
are still young and will improve
over time, but Harris is pleased
with wide receiver R.J. English.

“It was great to see R.J. step
up,” Harris said. “The run game is
just inexperienced and because they
are still young,_ they don’t know
what it takes yet.”

English became Pitt’s go-to
wide receiverrwith the absence of
injured Antonio Bryant. The ques-

'tion also arose if missing Bryant

affected the team.

“Any time you lose a special
player it affects the team,” Harris
said. “But it affected us more in the
first game because we had planned
to have him. It wasn’t as tough in

game two because we knew he was-
n’t going to play, but it is still hard
to replace that guy.”

According to Harris, Bryant is
still questionable for Saturday’s
game against Alabama-
Birmingham.

Bryant did break a sweat for the
first time in a week the other day
and was seen jogging up steps. If
Bryant can practice this week, he
will play Saturday.

Looking ahead to UAB, Harris
praised the Blazers’ wide receiver
Willie Quinne, saying he was the
fastest player in college football.
UAB coach Watson Brown would
agree with Harris, but is concerned
about his offense as a whole.

“We have an experienced
defense and good speed at wide
out,” Brown said. “But we have a
new, inexperienced offense.”

Saturday’s game has now
become a crucial point in Pitt’s sea-
son. How will the team overcome
the loss of last weekend?

“I won’t say this is the most
important game,” Harris said. “We
play'to win. We want to play for
four good quarters and that is some
thing we haven’t done yet.”

Walt Harris was pleased with the play of wide receiver R.J. English, who set

the lead, he and the entire Texas

team delivered. ‘
Longhorn fans cheered as quar-

terback Major Applewhite took a

knee on an extra-point attemptgwith
36 seconds remaining in Saturday’s
game against North Carolina. The
final score: Texas 44, UNC 14.

Everyone in attendance could
almost feel the spirit of Cole
Pittman, a former Texas defensive
end who-diedin a car accident on
Feb. 26.

‘ Saturday was Cole Pittman Day.
at Royal-Memorial Stadium, where
more than 80,000 fans arrived 20.
minutes early to be part of a cere-
mony to honor Cole, his brother,
Chase, and their parents, Marc and

Prior to the game, Texas

. head coach Mack Brown and the

Longhorn football team’ presented
the Pittman family with colt-rs No.
44 jersey, his T-.ring and his Texas
scrapbook. 7

JumboTron and_Brown_ and Marc

Pittman hugged each other at the

ceremony’_s completion.

“It was more ‘emotional than any
of us could have ever imagined
when we thought about doing this,”
Brown said of the ceremony.

Things got even more emotional
late in the game". Texas had a com-

. manding 38-14 lead with less than a

minute remaining in the fourth
quarter when fullback Brett Robin
scored on a 12-yard run to give
Texas 44 points. 1

_ At the urging of Longhorn play-
ers, the Texas coaching staff decid-
ed to take a knee on the extra point
and leave the score the same as
Cole’s number.

. Marc Pittman had a feeling
Texas would choose to score no
more points.

“After the 44' came on the
screen, I felt in my heart that they

The ceremony was accom-f
panied with a video tribute on the

would never do the extra point
before anything happened,” Pittman
said. “It was so fitting. It was like

Cole putting his stamp on the-

game.”

Next was the presentation of the
game ball to Marc and Judy Pittman
in the locker room after the victory.
All the players and coaches gath-
ered around the Pittmans as Brown
presented the ball. The entire team
began jumping and chanting “C.P.”

Pittman said the celebration by
the players lasted for a couple of
minutes.

“It had me stirred,” Pittman
said.

No Texas player will wear
Cole’s number at least until after
the 2002 season, which ‘is when he
would have exhausted his eligibili-
ty.

His locker, which is the same as
he left it before his tragic death,
will also remain that way until the
end of next season.

Brown said he and his wife,

Sally, have a tremendous amount of.

respect for the Pittman family.
“Sally and I have learned so

Longhorns win in honor of No. 44

much from them in the last six
months,” Brown said of the Pittman
family. “We’ve learned how to be
better parents. We call our kids a lot
more than we use to, talk to them,
and we hug them every time we see
them. The Pittmans are so tough,
and they’re such great role models.”

The Pittmans have received
thousands of letters since Cole’s
death, and not only from UT stu-
dents and alumni, but from people
all over the state of Texas and the
nation.

“You would not believe the
amount of letters we’ve received for
Cole,” Judy said. “Every day there
was just tons of mail. Most of the
letters were about how Cole’s death
affected their lives and changed
their lives.”

The football team will continue
to wear “CP” on the backs of their
helmets throughout the season.
Pittman said he still intends to
attend Longhorn games.

“Hey, Cole Pittman is on each
and every helmet,” Pittman said.
“Cole Pittman is out there, and I’m
going to be here.”
