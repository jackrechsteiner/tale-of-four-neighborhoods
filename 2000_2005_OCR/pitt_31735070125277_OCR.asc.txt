Search smcoraean

of social work school

itt has launched a na-
tional search for a new

School of Social

Work dean. _

The search committee‘ plans
a total of five meetings to hear
constituents’ recommendations
for what to look for in a clean.

Social work faculty members
were invited to address the com-
mittee on Dec. 6. Three sessions
for student groups — bachelor’s,
master’s and doctoral candidates
—- met with committee mem-

bers this week. A session for so-.

cial work staff will be scheduled

' ‘ for later this month, according

to search committee chair Rob-
ert Pack. Pack is vice provost for

, academic planning and resources

management. _

Social work constituents also
will have the opportunity to meet
with the linalists, who will be

invited to campus, Pack said. The A

committee plans to submit four
unranked ﬁnalists for the dean’s

position to Provostjames Maher‘

by the end of April. A new clean
is expected to be in place byjuly
1, Pack said. The dean reports
directly to the provost. '

So far, there have been no .

surprises at the meetings, Pack
said. “I think people are looking
-for a dean with a vision for social
work education, an understand-
ing of the,’ profession and where
it needs to move an for some-
one who understands how to in-
tegrate the ‘research, academic
and service components of the

school,” he said. -

Applications received by Feb.
9 will be given full consideration,
The committee will decide if
other candidates will be consid-
ered after that date. Candidates
must demonstrate a record that
warrants a tenured appointment
as professor in the school, Pack
said.

Ads have been placed in The
Chronicle of Higher Education
and social work professional jour-

nals across the country. In addi- .

tion, the job description has been
sent to all U.S. schools of social
work and all member institu-
tions of the Association ofAmeri—
can Universities.

‘ The new social work dean
will replace David‘ Epperson,
dean of the school since 1972,
who plans to step down at the
end of this academic year.

UnderEpperson’sleadership,
the school was ranked among
the top 10 percent of the 140

graduate social work programs-_

in the United States. Eight deans
of other U.S. social work schools
either are graduates of Pitt’s
School of Social Work or were
members of the Pitt school’s

«teaching faculty. ‘ '

Founded in 193 8, the Schoo

of Social Work enrolls about 1 50

Measures taken to alleviate Pitt
computer networking problems

itt’s computer net-
work problems have
been countered sig-
nificantly in recent weeks, in-

cluding improving the stability ‘

and efﬁciency of a popular in-
structional software program, ac-
cording to an official in the
Provost’s ofﬁce. .

' Plagued by network disrup-
tions and system failures
throughout the fall term, the
administration ordered an analy-
sis of network use and engaged a
three-pronged strategy to im-
prove network computing per-
formance.‘

Provost James V. Maher, in
an memo issued in October, told
deans, directors and department
heads that the administration’s
priority wasresolving three ‘is-
sues critical to the operation of
academic programs: providing
greater bandwidth (network ca-
pacity), improving the perfor-
mance of Courselnfo and ex-
tending external network access.

Two of the three priorities
have been addressed and the third

will be this‘ month, said Robert
Pack, vice provost for academic

' planning and resources manage-
ment. -

“We’ve had an significant
increase in bandwidth,” Pack
said, “and we’ve re-conﬁgured
the processors and re-organized

a some databases in the network.”

Pack said Pitt purchased from
the Pittsburgh Supercomputing

Center the equivalent of 45 _Mbps .
(million bits per second) to power
a secondary Internet connection.

(Bits per second is the unit mea-
suring a network’s capacity for
data transmission.)

The secondary connection
will bring “an alleviation of con-
current usage back-up prob-
lems,” Pack said. “We now have
a different Internet connection
for student resident hall users, so
there aren’t competing pressures
on the overall system between
the regular University commu-
nity users and student users.”

Student Internet trafﬁc will
be prevented from using the gen-
eral University Internet connec-

tion at the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center.—

The restriction applies to on-
campus computer lab users as
well. All computer usersstill can
access PittNet directly.

Additionally, ‘Pack said, Pitt
is increasing bandwidth by a to-
tal of 3 0 Mbps this month; 2 O are
in place and 10 more will be by
the end ofjanuary, bringing the

University’s total network ca—-

pacity to 125 Mbps.

Pack said Pitt also has im-
proved the Courselnfo system,
working in tandem with Black-
board, Inc., the software vendor
that owns the Courselnfo. copy-
right. ’ i .

Courselnfo is a much-use
integrated software package that
allows faculty to use web pages
for instruction. Courselnfo fea-
tures tools to administer, grade
and record quizzes, and facili-
tates instructors’ efforts’ to send
e—mail, transfer ﬁles to and from
students and manage an on-line
gradebook.

Joseph A. James

Public and International Af-
fairs professor emeritus Joseph
A. James died Dec. 23, 2000, of
cancer. He was 77. «

He served on the faculty of
GSPIA for more than 25 years,
retiring in 1984.

James helped to develop
courses in ﬁnancial administra-
tion and municipal management

at GSPIA. He taught courses in

1 ﬁscal management, intergovern-

mental relations, revenue admin-
istration and ﬁscal policy. He
was selected the school’s teacher
of the year in 1977 and 1981.

A former student of James’s,

GSPIA associate professor Kevin

Kearns, who is on a leave of ab— .

sence from the school to he_ad
the William J. Copeland Fund
and Elmer J. Tropman Non-
p_roﬁt Management Institute,
said, “Joe was a wonderful man.
He had a rough exterior, but
underneath was a heart of gold
and the sentiment of a teddy-
bear. He was an astounding
teacher. Probably the best I had
in my whole formal education.”

Early in his career, James
served as an assistant municipal
manager in Mt. Lebanon, and

Jack Matthews

Jack Matthews’s professional

’ credits at Pitt were impressive:

professor and chairperson of the
speech department from .1955
until his retirement in 1987; co-
founder of the Cleft Palate
Cranio-Facial Center, acting
dean of the humanities division,
1967 to 1968; University Senate
president, 1969 to 1972.

But in remembering
Matthews, who died on Dec. 18,
2000, friends and colleagues pre-
ferred to describe him in more
human terms: Renaissance man,
mediator, teacher, leader.

“He wasa magniﬁcent hu-
man being,” said Betty Jane
MCI/Villiams, professor emerita
of communication disorders and
a longtime colleague. “He was
such a caring person in addition
to being an outstanding leader.”

“Jack was a perennial, persis-
tent, ubiquitous scholar,” said
Robert Perloff, professor emeri-
tus of business and psychology.
“During the 1980s, when I gave
a seminar on program evalua-
tion, he enrolled as a student. He

was always interested in keeping_ '

up as a scholar.”
Matthews, ofVerona, died of
complications following surgery

while vacationing in Florida. He
was 83. ’
McWilliams called Matthews
“a great mediator” both as Sen-
ate president and in resolving
conﬂicts between the Pitt ad-
ministration and students dur-
ing the turbulent 1960s.
Matthews was a liberal who op-
posed the Vietnam War, but he
also opposed violence and
“helped to keep a lid on campus
unrest,” McWilliams said. -
jVVhile sailing on the spring
1983 voyage of the Pitt-spon-
sored Semester at Sea (SAS) pro-
gram, Matthews stepped forward
to stave off another potential di-
saster. VVhen the v/oyage’s aca-
demic dean died of heart failure,
Matthews agreed to serve as act-
ing dean and helped to salvage
the voyage academically. ‘
‘ “A lot of people looked up to
Jack,” said James Mauch, an
emeritus professor of education
and himself a former University
Senate president. “He was a
gentleman and a very conscien-
tious citizen of this University.”
Matthews and Mauch co-
authored a 1990 book, “The
Emeritus Professor,” which ar-
gued that universities should take

During World War II he
served as a research chemist at
American Cyanamid in
Bridgeville, Pa. After the war he
became assistant director of
chemical research at Reed and
Carnrick Pharmaceuticals inJer-

sey City, N.J.

Bianculli joined the Pitt fac-

ulty in 1948 as an assistant pro-
‘ fessor and, over the next decade,
he was named associate profes-
sor, professor of pharmaceutical
chemistry and chairman of the
Department of Chemistry. In
195 8 he was named acting dean
and in 1961‘ dean of the School
of Pharmacy. Shortly before the
death of his ﬁrst wife in 1976 he
stepped down as clean but re-
mained on the pharmacy faculty.
Although he retired-in 1981,
Bianculli maintained an ofﬁce-in
Salk Hall until shortly before his
death. ’ . ~
“He had, the ability to make
students who disliked chemistry
love it. VVhether they were lov-
ing chemistry or Dr. B., I’m not
sure,” said Randy Juhl, dean of
Pitt’s School of Pharmacy. ‘
Bianculli taught multiple gen-
_ erations of Pitt pharmacy stu-
dents. “It wouldn’t be unusual

his interest in blending academic
theory with practical tools for
effective government adminis-
tration. He authored or contrib-
uted to many publications deal-
ing with local government ad-
ministration, urban ﬁscal policy,
intergovernmental relations and
administrative codes.

James served on many gov-
ernment study commissions
dealing with issues such as coop-
erative purchasing, governmen-
tal consolidation, taxation and
urban ﬁscal problems. ‘

He chaired the Allegheny

County Government Study7

Commission in 1973-1974, an
early effort to“ develop a home

better advantage of the talents of
their retired faculty.

Matthews came to Pitt as a
post-doctoral student in 1948.
He was appointed as an assistant
professor in the psychology de-
partment in 1950 and became
chairperson of what was then the
Department of Speech and The-
atre Arts in 1955.

Matthews earned a bachelor’s
degree from Heidelberg College
in Tifﬁn, Ohio, in 1938. “He
earned a master of arts degree
from Ohio University in 1940,
and a Ph.D. in speech and psy-
chology from Ohio State in 1946.
Matthews also did graduate work-
at Vanderbilt and Purdue before
coming to Pitt. 1

IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

I have again become involved in a UPMC
Health Plan issue. The current problem is the
high volume of errors in the plan’s explanation of
beneﬁt forms (EOB). A number of plan beneﬁcia-_
ries have shared with me difﬁculties they have '
encountered because of such errors. I mentioned
V these EOB problems at the last two Faculty As-

sembly and Senate Council meetings. The errors
‘ are denials of coverage, or of full coverage, under
the HMO plan and the point-of-service plan. These errors place
medical expenses on plan members, rather than on the plan, and
have increased in volume because health beneﬁts for Pitt em-
ployees now are available only from the UPMC Health Plan.
' Steps have been taken to deal with this problem —— the
dedicated V-plan phone line for.Pitt employees to present their
problems; the opportunity for Pitt employees to meet with a plan
representative on campus. But the problems continue. In some
instances, aftera problem «seernin"gly' is resolved,-it recurs. ’ ' ’
In November I asked Don Williams, the plan’s manager of
the Pitt account, whether the errors wererpart of a plan strategy
to shift costs to its beneﬁciaries, or the result of a severely
deﬁcient information system. He assured me that the plan’s
errors in its favor were not intentional; he did admit problems
with its information system. J
In December, a high University ofﬁcial asked me why em-
ployees contacted me about their plan problems. I answered that
those who contacted me were frustrated because of the errone-
ous EOB forms, continuing to have to deal with plan represen-
tatives to straighten matters out, and that help from Human
Resources was limited to telling them to contact plan represen-
tatives. The University,,particularly Human Resources, has not
been sufﬁciently aggressive on behalf of the University’s em-
ployees. It is in the‘University’s interest to get tough. After all,
most of the time spent on the phone dealing with the plan is
during the Pitt employees’-workday, time that could be spent on ,
Pitt business. - _ ‘ 9
An employer that provides employee health beneﬁts recently
asked for my thoughts about switching from Highmark to the
UPMC Health Plan. Premiums would be substantially less. If
related my experiences, and.those of Pitt" employees, with plan

  

time its employees would use to deal with beneﬁts problerris, and -
weigh its value against the premiums saving. "

1 Improving the information system quicklyis in the interest of
the plan, Pitt employees and the University. Perhaps a few of the’
many dollars spent on media to extol the virtues of the plan and
its lack of interference with provider—patient relations could be
directed to the information system. Also, Pitt should insist on
some performance standard for the plan’s handling of beneﬁt
claims, and for a ﬁnancial penalty on the plan when the error rate
in its favor exceeds the ‘speciﬁed standard. Finally, data concern-

'ing plan failings should .be_ transmitted to the appropriate Com-
monwealth regulating body, which might pressure the plan to
do better. — 1 '

The response to the planned Feb. 15 special plenary session,

“The Open University: Is Pitt‘ Open Enough?,” has been disap-
pointing. Relatively few requests to speak at the plenary session
have been received. The Senate’s ofﬁcers may decide, unless we
receive more ‘requests to speak soon, to cancel this plenary
session. Perhaps we have misjudged the amount of interest of ..
Senate members in the subject; perhaps Senate members are
timid about publicly addressing an issue in a way that might be
viewed as critical of how Pitt operates. I encourage any Senate
member who wants to participate to promptly send a précis of
what he or she would say to the Senate ofﬁce._A decision will have

to._be made before the*end of January on whether to cancel. I

  STEPHEN
  THOMAS

Public health proﬁessor

sees progress toward   A

eliminating racial and

ethnic health disparities e

Gazin g from a window at Pitt’s,Graduate School ofPublic
Health (GSPH) at the hospitals and Health Sciences schools

that dominate the Oakland skyline, Stephen B, Thomas

observes: “In those buildings are some of the world ’s leading
health researchers. And yet, in neighborhoods that are almost
literally in the shadows of those buildings, people are dying of
diseases that are easily treatable or preventable. . .
“That” Thomas declares, “is no longer scientiﬁcally or
morally acceptable.” _ .
Thomas, 47, came to Pittsburgh_in August, after seven

_ years as director of Emory University ’s Institute for Minority

Health Research, to head GSPH’s Center. ﬁor Minority
Health. “One of the center’s chief missions, ” he says, “is to
build bridges so we can apply the scientiﬁc knowledge and
expertise at this University to health problems in the commu-
nities that are in greatest need of that knowledge, ” including
African—American ’neighho'rhood‘s"near Pitt.-I - P‘  *3 .. -e 2  A.

This week, the C enter for Minority Health; in conjunc-
tion with the National Institutes of Health ’s (NIH) Oﬂice of
Disease Prevention —— is conveninga summit here ofminority
health leaders and scholars from around the United States.
The theme of the summit, which began yesterday, ]an. 10,
and continues through j’an 12: eliminating racial and ethnic
health disparities. ‘ I

According to the NIH, the death rate from cardiovascular
disease is 40 percent higher for African-Americans than it is
forwhites. For all cancers, the death rate among blacks is 30
percent higher than fbr whites. The HIV/AIDS death rate for
blacks is seven times what it is for whites. _

“What isso perplexing and frustrating, ” Thomassays, “is
that we know how to prevent and treat these conditions.
Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes. Infant mortality. HI V-
AIDS, as devastating as it is, is totally preventable. Many
forms of cancer are preventable or can be treated early.”

Thomas wasa teenager, working asa respiratory therapist
(a job that, at the time, required no formal training), when
he ﬁrst encountered people dying’ of preventable diseases. “I
helped to treat a lot of people dying of chronic obstructive lung
disease, the results of 20 or 30 years of smoking. I saw ﬁrst-
hand how extremely eﬁfective medical science can be in the end
stages of life. But what kind of life were we saving these people

_’ for? A very crippled existence. I felt that, I was going to be
2 a health care professional, I wanted to get involved earlier

than at the end of the line. ’_’

His epiphany came during a 1976 visit to the People’s
Republic of China. Thomas, an Ohio State undergraduate at
the time, was the onlyvAfrican—Amer,ican among 20 U.S.
students on a cultural exchange program. "China was extolling
the virtues of its “bareﬁiot doctors” —- public health workers,

' trained in acupuncture and herbal medicine, sent to the

countryside to care ﬁor peasant populations. “In other words,
low—tech, high—impac't health care, ” Thomas says. “It'wa's all
very idealistic, but I was captivated. I/Vhen I returned to the
“ United States, I realized that prevention wasa legitimate wa
to focus one’s career. [discovered the field of public health, and
I ’ve never looked back. ”
Thomas grew up in Columbus, Ohio, one of six children.
- “My father was an accountant and my mother was a nurse, so
I was always being exposed to clinical kinds of things, seeing
her come home every day wearing her white nurse ’s uniform
and one {of _those starched nurse’s hats that they wore back
then. ” Today, Thomas lives in Highland Park with his wife,
GSPH associate professor Sandra Quinn, and his stepson,
Brian Quinn, 16. This ‘summer, ﬁir the fourth consecutive
year, Thomas and his stepson will participate in a cattle drive
in I/Vyoming. “It’s hard work,” Thomas says, “herding 500

_ This week, Thomas was interviewed by University Times
Assistant Editor Bruce Steele. l ,

.University Times: VVhy do so many African-Ameri-

cans fear and distrustthe medical community?

Thomas: One of the things I’ve discovered through my
research is that, among many African-Americans, there
is a genuine concern that the health care delivery system
will not treat them fairly. Much of that fear and mistrust
is’ rooted _, in the continuing legacy of the Tuskegee
Syphilis_Study, which took place from 1932 to 1972. It

iwasthe longest non-therapeutic experiment on human

beingsin the history of medicine, and it was stopped
following newspaper reports that nearly 400 black share-

. 3’croppers:‘fromi,Alabama 'h‘ad goneuntreated [by U.S.~"

public, health ofﬁcials] for syphilis, even though a treat-
ment for syphilis was available. . -

’ Out of that came Congressional hearings and new
guidelines and regulations for protection of human
subjects in research. But then, unfortunately, the

Tuskegee legacy did not become part of the culture of j

training researchers and health professionals. _So we
kind of forgot. Then the AIDS epidemic hit in 1981.

‘That required us to go into communities and mobilize

people to do what we knewwould prevent the spread of
the disease, and to test people for HIV._That’s when my
research team discovered that this legacy of Tuskegee
was still having its impact. African—Americans were
refusing to be tested for HIV. Many believed that AIDS
was a man-made virus designed to eliminate black people.
‘Since that time, our research has documented that this
fear of the medical community is not limited to AIDS,
but that it has its impact in other areas such as not seeing
a doctor on a regular basis or taking medications.
That’s the ‘patient side of the equation- On the
provider side, a growing body of evidence suggests that
there is a subtle form of racial bias in the doctor’s office,
that two patients coming in with the same symptoms get

i diagnosed differently or receive different treatment

options based on their race or gender.

‘ .As you said, the Tuskegee study gained notoriety in

the early 1970s. Were African—Americans less re-
luctant to participate in clinical trials or seek medi-
cal -treatment prior to that? ' A

I don’t know if the data is there to give a deﬁnite
answer to that question. One thing we do know is that in
1932, the men who joined the Tuskegee study did not
know theywere joining a research study. They thought
they were getting‘ treatment, and they showed up volun-
tarilyin droves. Those men trusted the doctors. The
irony is that today we’re dealing with diseases that are
preventable and treatable with segments of our popula-
tion who don’t trust doctors. Whereas, in the 1930s,
when this egregious event took place, there was a blind
trust. This trust that once" was given unconditionally
now must be earned. .

I think that the presidential apology on May 16, 1997
— when the president of the United States apologized

g on behalf of the American government to the eight

remaining survivors of the Tuskegee study —— provided
the opportunity for a new beginning. President Clinton
apologized to the men who actually suffered, and they
accepted the apology. VVhile a lot of people are still

understandably angry over what happened in the
Tuskegee study, we need to move forward. In order to

I eliminate ethnic.and racial health disparities, we have to
increase the participation of women and minorities in

clinical and public health research.

_i How do you counter their reluctance and mistrust? I

What’s your sales pitch?

Let’s take the example of breast cancer. More white
women develop breast cancer than black women, but
more black women die from it. In order to understand
why this disparity exists, black women need to be part of
research studies. Is it biology? Are black women’s bodies
so different from their white counterparts’ bodies that
they have different kinds of cancer and die? Or is it, as I
believe, that fear and misinformation are preventing
black women from accessing care early enough? That
black women who are diagnosed with tumors are not
offered the interventions that can make a difference? To

. answer these questions, we need to conduct research.

That’s my pitch. , ,
VVhy are African—American diabetics more likely
than white diabetics to have their fingers and feet ampu-
tated? Those kinds of disparities disappear among blacks
and _whites who participate in clinical research trials.
Why? Because everybody’s getting the same kind of
treatment. I suggest to people that, by participating in
clinical research, you’ll be getting state-of—the-art care.
Part of the solution lies in being offered the oppor-
tunity. Soine African-Americans don’t enroll in these
studies because they don’t know about them‘. So we’re
also saying to researchers: You cannot look at a person
and assume, j_1_1st because they’re black or Hispanic, that
they don’t want to participate in your research study.

Thereis an ar ment that sa s on can’t force’
8“ Y a Y

people to look after themselves and their loved
ones. How can any reasonably responsible citizen
today — even if they’re poor, even if they’re illiter-
ate -— not know that it’s dangerous to smoke ciga-
rettes, to drink alcohol excessively, to share hypo-
dermic needles, to have unprotected sex with people
they don’t know very well? Isn’t public health a two-
way street?

Yes, it is a tw_o-way street. But you must lookat the
social context within which these diseases exist. For
example, you mentioned cigarette smoking.'It’s true, no

I one puts a gun to your head and makes you light up. But

at the same time, there have been inner-city minority
communities’ that were literally inundated with bill-
boardadvertising for cigarettes. Pick up a black maga-
zine like Essence or Ebony. Who’s doing most of the

advertising? Cigarette companies. Alcohol producers.‘

You cannot separate personal behavior from the societal
inﬂuences helping to shape that behavior.

We have effective interventions to help people to
quit smoking. It’s an addiction. Stop. treating it as a
moral failure. People should be able to be treated for
addictions and not be denied treatment because they
don’t have insurance.

You also brought up the example of sharing hypoder-
mic needles. The science is clear that programs that
provide clean needles stop the spread of AIDS. Yet, it is
against the law to use federal funds to support needle

exchange programs; Some states have laws that say you _

cannot go into a drugstore and buy needles without a
prescription. These are policy barriers that are prevent-
ing people from taking more responsible action.

Last but not least, it’s not the individual’s fault that
there are waiting lists to get into treatment. These
things must be addressed from a broader community
and policy context. We need to move beyond victim-
blaming and look at what we can do to change the system
so people are encouraged to access care. I .

VVhat are you hoping this week’s summitwill achieve?
One of the unique features of this summit is that is
will include representation from the NIH, foundations,
several state offices of minority health, and other aca-
demiccenters for minority health like ours. And theii
you have the ethnic groups: African—Americans, Native
Americans, whites, Hispanics, Asian Americans. We’ve
never had all of the stakeholders in the same room at the
same time. This summit requires the scientists to talk to
the policy makers, and for both of them to talk to the
community organizers. '
Another factor is the national campaign launched last
year to eliminate ethnic and racial disparities in health.
This is a first. Before, the standard procedure was to set
national health goals for America, and then we would set
lower goals for minorities. VVhen President Clinton
announced the campaign to eliminate disparities, he said
that we are now going to have one set of health goals for
all Americans. The challenge is to close the gaps where
they exist, and make sure that all Americans are beneﬁt-
ing from what modern medical science has to offer. ’*"

G PH gets grant to study racial, ethnic  

differences in adult health service use

Pitt has received a $1.27 mil-
lion federal grant to study racial
and ethnic differences in health
status and the use of health ser-
vices among adults.

The grant is one of nine
awarded by the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services’
Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ) to address
ethnic and racial health dispari-
ties. The grant establishes Pitt as
a Center for Excellence in. Mi-
nority Health Research-

“We are very excited about
this grant, which will jump-start
the research program in our
Center for Minority Health,”
said Edmund Ricci, chairperson

of the Department of Health
Services Administration in Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH) and principal
investigator on the project.

“The research funded
through the AHRQ grant will
yield tremendous beneﬁts in
terms of the prevention, diagno-
sis and treatment of diseases and
disabilities that affect minority
adult populations in unnecessar-
ily large numbers,” said Stephen
B. Thomas, director of the Cen-
ter for Minority Health and co-
principal investigator.

Pitt’s program involves
GSPH and the schools of medi-

cine and social work. Each of the

program’s four projects will in-
volve a minority person as prin-
cipal investigator or co—princi—
pal investigator, and each of the
program’s three administrative
cores will have a minority direc-

tor or co—'director. Researchers-
will mentor minority health care .

students involved in the’ four
projects. Community members
will be involved at every level,
beginning with the development
of research questions. Commu-
nity members also will review
drafts of ﬁndings and conclu-
sions and have the chance-to of-
fer their own interpretations of
the ﬁndings.

The projects address four of

the six priority areas outlined in
Healthy People 2010, the Na-
tional Institutes of Health’s di-
rective for improving the public
health of all Americans by the
year 2010. Their titles are
“Elimination of Disparities in
Adult Immunization Status,”

“Patient Provider Communica-
tion Regarding Cancer Screen-
ing,” “An Intervention/Evalua-
tion Study to Control Lipid Dis-
orders and Hypertension in Af-
rican-American Males” and “Us-
ing Oral Histories to Improve’

Tribute to Slesinger set for Jan. 17

Pitt’s Department of Eco-
nomics will hold a tribute to the

late Professor Emeritus Reuben

E. Slesinger on Jan. 17 at 4 p.m.
in Heinz Chapel. ‘
-Slesinger, who taught eco-
nomics at Pitt for more than 60
years, died Oct. 30, 2000, at 84.
' Although he retired in 1986,
Slesinger maintained a regular
teaching schedule until the week
before his death. During his ca-
reer, Slesinger taught econom-
ics to an estimated 60,000 stu-

, dents

dents. ' ‘ -

Upon_ Slesinger’s ofﬁcial re-
tirement at age 70, a fund was
established in his name, enabling
the economics department to
recruit and assist graduate stu-
and to perpetuate
Slesinger’s scholarly legacy.

The family also is establish-

ing a memorial fund in

Slesinger’s honor at the Tree of
Life Synagogue, Wilkins and
Shady avenues, Pittsburgh

The national campaign has
identiﬁed six priority areas: in-
fant mortality, cardiovascular
disease, cancer screening and
management, diabetes, HIV-
AIDS, and adult and child im-
munization. In addition, there
are things like mental health dis-
parities that need to be addressed.

Part of the context of this
summit is that the U.S. Con-
gress recently passed legislation
establishing a new NIH Center
for Minority Health and Health
Disparity, with an initial budget
of over $100 million. That’s his-
toric, and this meeting is coming
right on the heels of the creation
of that center. In fact, as part of
the summit, on_]an. 11 there will
be a community forum in the
Hill House auditorium. At that
forum, the NIH will publicly
announce the creation of the new
center. . '

I see a paradigm shift in this
country regarding racial and eth-
nic health disparities. For ex-
ample, the theme of this year’s
American Public Health Asso-
ciation meeting was eliminating
health disparities. Later this year,
the Society for General Internal
Medicine will meet in San Di-
ego, and its theme, too, will be
eliminating disparities. It’_s more
than window dressing or politi-
cal rhetoric. I believe it’s a true

_ recognition that these dispari-

ties do not need to exist. It is
within our power scientiﬁcally
and politically to close the gap.

Will this “paradigm shift,” as
you call it, be affected by a
Bush administration?

That’s one of the issues we’ll
talk about at this summit. Does
the campaign to eliminate health
disparities belong to only one
political party? I would suggest
that the health of the American
people cuts across politics. Are
there different strategies or
methods that might be used?

Probably’. But even the new ad-
ministration is talking about how
they trust people at the local
level, and want to give more au-
thority to state government. We
just received a letter of endorse-
ment to be read at the summit
from Pennsylvania [Robert] Sec-
retary of Health Zimmerman.
Part of the key for any policy
initiative coming out of a bu,-
reaucracy like the federal gov-
ernment is that there have to be
stakeholders, there have to be
people in communities across the
country willing and able to-hold
the bureaucrats accountable. At
this summit, you’re going to see
the people who have committed
themselves to doing that.-
They’re coming from Boston,
from San Francisco, Nebraska,

Atlanta, all over. You’re talking ,

about people who have commit-
ted themselves to holding the
new administration accountable
for making sure that eliminating
health disparities is not rhetoric
but is real.

VVha_t tangible progress do you I

expect to see, say, in the next
decade? Will more African-
Americans be enrolled in Pitt
research studies and hired as
Pitt faculty members? Will
infant mortality rates among
blacks be lower?

,1 would say yes to all of those
things. It’s already happening.
I/Vhen I arrived in Pittsburgh
lastAugust, there were front page
newspaper stories about the
Healthy Start Initiative, focused
on improving infant mortality
rates, particularly among Afri-
can—Americans in Allegheny
County. It’s been quite success-
ful.

Let’s talk about the recruit-
ment of black faculty. This school

was established in 1948, and I

was the ﬁrst African-American
tenured professor in the history
of this school. Now, this week’s

summit will bring a diverse con-
stellation of minority folks to the
University of Pittsburgh. "You
want to talk about, “We can’t
ﬁnd qualiﬁed people”? They’re
going to be right here on cam-
pus. And this is just the begin-
ning. We have a summit web site
that will help to maintain the
conversation and relationships
that we’ll-build. Hopefully, mi-
nority and-women faculty and
potential faculty will come to
this summit and realize, even in
the winter: Hey, the University
of Pittsburgh is an exciting place,
where you can come and grow.
Last month, Dr. Arthur
Levine [Pitt senior vice chancel-
lor for Health Sciences] an-
nounced the recruitment of a
new chairman of the Depart-
ment of Family Medicine, and it
happens to be a female African-
American physician, Dr._Ieanette-
South-Paul. So there’s another
ﬁrst. I think this change is di-
rectly related to the leadership
here at the University. Dr.
Levine has been here for two
years, and he’s a real supporter
of what we’re doing in the Cen-
ter for Minority Health. Chan-
cellor Nordenberg has just es-
tablished the Chancellor’s Advi-
sory Group on Diversity, of
which I’m a member. I would say
to~you that there is leadership at

the top of this institution that ,

suggests we’re turning a" corner
here. ‘ ‘

Here’s another example of the
progress that’s being made: Our
center has just entered into a
partnership with the Epidemiol-
ogy Data Center that’s run by
Dr. Katherine Detre, which is a
premiere research engine here

' at the University. She and I have

begun collaborating with the
GatewayMedical Society, which
is the organization of black phy-
sicians in Allegheny County. It’s
easy to forget'that there was a
time when blacks could not be
members of the American Medi-
cal Association or its local coun-
terpart, so black doctors had to

form their own groups. At the 1
_national level,_it’s called the N a-

tional Medical Association; lo-

~cally, it’s’ the,Gateway Medical

Society. This society previously

had no formal relationship with I

the University of Pittsburgh.

‘Through this new partnership,

we will provide black physicians
with access to the computer back-
bone of the University. They

will be able to harvest the medi-

cal literature in our Health Sci— I

ences Library. In our visits to
some of these [African—Ameri—
can] physicians, we found that

ey were just not plugged in.
And it’s one thing to be plugged
in, andanother to know how to
ﬁnd the information you need,
so part of this project will in-
volve continuingmedical educa-
tion training on how to utilize
the Internet for health informa-
tion. ‘

dation recently released a report _

on computer use and technology
in Allegheny County, and one of
their ﬁndings was that comput-
ers were being underutilized in
the black community. We see
that digital divide as being seri-
ous, and our ﬁrst effort to close
the gap and build relationships
withblack physicians is through

this Internet project. Once that

bridge is put in place, we will be
able to ﬁnd out what their needs
and concerns are, what their re-
search issues are. I

GSPH to stud health
differences of chronically
ill elderly blacks, whites

Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH) has re-
ceived a $1.85 million federal

grant to study differences in-

health and self—care among
chronically ill elderly blacks and
whites in western Pennsylvania,
and the effects of these differ-
ences.

The study will compare long-
term changes in self—care behav-
iors of_African—Americans and
Caucasians, aged 65 and older,
who are suffering from at least
one of two chronic illnesses
prevalent among the elderly -
osteoarthritis and coronary ar-
tery disease.

Self-care behaviors are de-
ﬁned in the study as activities
that individuals perform incar-

ing for themselves as a result of V
their illness, such as exercising, I

modifying diets and taking medi-
cations, home remedies, vitamins
or other herbal or nutritiona
supplements. ’
“This grant-will allow us to
look at differences in how eld-
erly black and white patients care
for themselves and how these
self—care behaviors changeover

the length of the illness, and to ,
.. determine if those differences

affect health outcomes,” said
Myrna Silverman, professor of
public health ‘and anthropology,
and the study’s principal investi-
gator. ‘

Researchers will conduct four
personal and three telephone
interviews with each of 1,200
patients from Allegheny County
(half of them African American,
half white) over, 30 months. In-

formation from the participants
will help researchers deﬁne how
patients develop, maintain and
change their self—care, and how
these behaviors are affected by
changes in the disease, the
patient’s environment and his or
her‘ social and psychological
characteristics.

Results are expected to show '

how self—care behaviors affect the
patient’s long—term quality of life

and physical and mental health, *

and how racial differences in self-
care contribute to different out-’
comes.

‘_“We believe the results will
highlight some differences in
minority self—care and elderly
self—care in general, which could
provide clues for the develop-
ment of culturally sensitive pa-
tient e_ducation "programs on the
importance ofparticular self—care
behaviors for the management
of a speciﬁc illness,” Silverman

said. “This could lead to an im-
provement in health services and, ,

ultimately, the health of all older

. adults.”

This research is a follow-up
to a ‘previous study in which
Silverman gathered data on self-

care "behaviors and found_’sig-‘

niﬁcant differences according to
race. The current study will fo-
cus on the changes in these,be—
haviors over time, and the ef-
fects these behaviors have on
patients’ health.

The study, to be completed

‘in mid—2004, is funded through

a grant from the National Insti-
tute on Aging, one of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. I

JANUARY 1.1, 2001

Trustees approve FY01 salaries
for Pitt’s semor administrators

oing away with bo-
nuses for Pitt senior
officers, the~Board of

Trustees compensation commit-

tee on Dec. 7 raised Chancellor .

Mark A. Nordenberg’s salary to
$325 ,000 this year.

Trustees also approved, at
Nordenberg’s recommendation,
raises for seven other Pitt offic-
ers. See list on t/yispzzge.

The new salaries are retroac-
tive to July 1, the beginning of
Pitt’s ﬁscal year.

‘Nordenberg’s new salary is
6.6 percent higher than his pay
last year of $305,000, which in-
cluded a $40,000 “performance/
market adjustment,” as Pitt trust-
ees and administrators call the
incentives. 0

Trustees had awarded per-:

formance/market bonuses to
Nordenberg each year since
1997. _Last year, at the
chancellor’s recommendation,
trustees also gave bonuses to Vice
Chancellor for Institutional Ad-
vancement .Carol A. Carter

' ($10,000), Executive Vice Chan-

cellorJerome Cochran ($2 0,000)
and Provost James Maher
($25,000). —

But trustees said they won’t
award ‘any more bonuses to
Nordenberg and his team. Such
incentives are no longer‘ appro-
priate, board chairperson J.W.
Connolly said, now that the

V N ordenberg‘ administration has

established’aistitorigitiiaclérécord.

“The past year again estab-
lished all-time records for stu-
dent applications, the academic
credentials of entering students,
private fundraising, research sup-
port and total revenues,” said

Connolly, who also ‘chairs: the
board’s four—member compen-
sation committee. “In addition,
the Universi_ty’s facilities con-
tinue to be dramatically im-
proved and Pitt is taking an. in-
creasingly prominent position in
regional development. I

“These accomplishments are
a credit to everyone at the Uni-
versity, but there is no doubt in

my mind that the driving force”

behind them has been creative
and committed leadership.”
While current -Pitt officers

won’t receive future bonuses,

their ITIOSC recent ones were

, folded into their base salaries.

Previously, the bonuses did not
carry over from one year to the

next. Thus, Nordenberg’s new-

base salary of $3,25,000"is 22.6
percent more than" his base sal-
ary of $265,000 last year.

The compensation Commit-
tee met via a speakerphone
hookup in 159 Cathedral of
Learning. Committee members
did not stay on the line to answer
reporters’ questions following
the meeting.

But Nordenberg, who at-
tended, said: “To me, the use of
single-year performance pay-
ments probably was more ap-
propriate as this administration

began its work. It signaled that ‘

we would be focusing on par-
ticular objectives measured over
a_ rela_tively compressed period

of‘timve: We “:have’; njowg be"ei1~‘:at’

this task for a number of years.
The assessment of the leader-
ship team can thus be more eas-
ily measured in performance and
not just in potential.”

Pitt student awarded
Marshall Scholarship    

he British Embassy has
1,, , named Pitt senior
Andrew K._Petiprin as

one of‘40 Marshall Scholars na-
tionwide for 2001.

Considered to be one of the
most competitive and prestigious
merit scholarships in America,
the Marshall Scholarship was

treated by the British Parliament
in honor of General George
Marshall as a gesture of thanks
for U.S. assistance in the after-
math of World War II.

‘Like the Rhodes Scholarship,
the Marshall emphasizes char-
acter as well as intellect. But while

— avRhodes Scholarship restricts

study to Oxford University, a
Marshall guarantees access and
funding atany British university
for two years of study toward a
degree.

Pitt is the only public institu-
tion in Pennsylvania represented
among the Marshall winners this
year. The University of Penn-
sylvania is the only other school
in this state with a Marshall

V scholar’this year. _

« Only Harvard (with five
Marshalls) and Brown (two) had
more than one Marshall scholar
this year.

During the last 15 years, Pitt J

students have won more‘
Marshalls (six) and Rhodes
Scholarships (three) than any

other Pennsylvania college or.

university, private or public.
Fluent in French and Ger-
man, Petiprin has earned a 3.9
GPA while majoring in French
and history, with a minor in
German and classics.
In his hometown of Orlando,

‘Fla., he has helped to feed the

homeless and has tutored under-
graduates and high school stu-
dents. Petiprin also is active with
Pittsburgh’s Sixth Presbyterian
Church. ' 0'
“Andrew is the ideal Marshall
Scholar,” said Alec Stewart, dean
of the University Honors Col-
lege and Pitt’s Marshall repre-
sentative. “He is a socially com-
mitted intellectual whose talent

is informed by unbounded curi— .

osity and a deep desire to help
others.”

It is said that nobody wins a
Marshall or Rhodes scholarship
single—handedly, a statement

"with which Petiprintreadily

agreed.

He credited three faculty
members in particular for in-
spiring and encouraging him:
Renate Kosinski, of .the French

mended “somewhat larger than
normal” raises for Arthur G.
Ramicone, vice chancellor for
Budget and Controller (1 3 .2 per-
cent) and Treasurer Amy K.
Marsh (7.1 percent),-because of
the ﬁnance area’s strong perfor-
mance. Pitt’s endowment and

operating budget each exceed $1
billion, the chancellor noted.
The presidents of Pitt’s Uni-

, versity Senate and Staff Associa-

tion Council (SAC) welcomed
the elimination of bonuses for

officers. They also said the new .
salaries are fair,‘ given the Pitt _

administrators’ responsibilities
and job performances.

get rid of the bonus system,”

“The Honors College was

think that’s an appropriate con-
cept to use at an educational in-
stitution. It may be appropriate
in certain circumstances, but
when you’re doing it year after

Even building the bonus in-
crements into the salary bases
[of-Carter, Cochran, Maher and

Hershey added that “there’s
a serious imbalance” in a society
where Pitt’s chancellor earns
$325 ,000 a year and-a baseball
player — Texas Rangers short-
stop Alex Rodriguez — gets a
guaranteed 10-year, $252 mil-

SAC president Rich Colwell
said he was “pleased to see that
upper administration did not re-
ceive bonuses this year and are
treated the same as all staff. Their
salary increases are in ‘line with
those of staff who have also re-
ceived performance/market ad-
justments in their base salary.

“I would also echo board
chairperson J.W. Connolly’s
comments that Chancellor
Nordenberg and his senior lead-
ership team continue to spear-
head the efforts that are moving
our University to new heights of
excellence.”

Pitt’s budget for faculty and
staff salaries increased by 4.5
percent this year. Of that-, 2 per-
cent cost-of-living raises were
awarded to personnel judged to
have _done satisfactory work.
Another 2 percent was allocated
for merit, market and equity ad-
justments. Provost Maher__and

distributed the remaining 0.5
percent to targeted areas to meet

shape at this point,” Oshry said.
Last fall’s public announcement

of the $500 million Pitt cam-
paign, with 70 percent of the
goal committed, “brought us to
the stage where it’s clear that the
campaign will be successful,” he
said. _

The Carnegie Institute’s
campaign is in its “quiet phase”
preceding the public announce-
ment of a goal. Oshry said a-
major appeal of the Institute job
was getting in on the beginning
of a new fundraising drive.

“It’s the part of fundraising

that appeals to me the most,” he 1

said. “It’s. primarily where my
own background in fundraising
has been. I like the entrepre-
neurial aspect of starting a cam-

paign and getting volunteers in ‘

place, training them and getting
everyone on the same page.”
No goal has been set for the‘

Carnegie Institute campaign,
according to Oshry. “We’re lit-
erally in the beginning stages,”
he said. The institute.’s last cam-
paign, completed seven years
ago, raised $139 million.

Looking back on Pitt’s cam-

paign, Oshry said: “When we
firstkbegan discussing the cam-
paign in early 1997, my sense
was that it was going to be suc-
cessful. But I did not in my wild-
est imagination think that we
would do as well as we have done:
I think that success is attribut-
able to [Chancellor] Mark
Nordenberg’s leadership, it’s at-
tributable to a very dedicated
group of ‘development profes-
sionals, led by [Institutional Ad-
vancement Vice Chancellor]
"Carol Carter, and it’s attribut-
able to an outstanding group of
volunteers and to the
U_niversity’s own importance to
this community.

“This was the first Pitt cam-
paign to be run extensively
through the use of volunteers,
and I feel very proud of that. I
think that campaigns require
volunteers. They represent the
strengdi of an organization. Pitt’s
campaign involved somewhere
around .2 50 volunteers.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Postal rate increase not expected
to have major affect on costs here

 

ostal rates in some
classifications went
up this week, but a

Pitt mailing services ofﬁcial says
the increases will not have a major
impact on mailing costs for the
University.

Gus Tytke, assistant director
of University Mailing Services,
said “Right now, we don’t want
to confuse anyone, because it is a
complicated thing. But I don’t
see the increases as being overly
dramatic to the University.”

Mailing Services handles
about 28 million pieces of mail
annually, Tytke said. The high-
est percentage of mailing costs
are for bulk—rate mailings, he
said,_ which in some categories
actually went down in cost. .

Last month, the U.S. Postal
Service, a quasi-independent
agency that receives no” tax
money for operations, an-
nounced sweeping rate changes,
which were approved by the
service’s Board of Governors
December 5. The rate changes
went into effectjan. 7.

According to news releases
issued by the postal service last
fall, earnings for fiscal year 1999
topped $3 50 million; but the ser-
vice incurred a $1 99 million deﬁ-

cit this past fiscal year, which.

ended Sept. 30. The postal ser-
vice also carries a $3.5 billion
debt from prior years.

The U.S. Postal Service de-

livers about‘40 percent of the
world’s volume of mail. Rates
are set by class of mail with the
legal mandate that each class

cover its own cost. Overall, rates '

went up 4.6 percent.

First-class mail went upia_"

penny from 33 to 34 cents for the
first ounce, about a 3 percent
increase. But the first—class rate
for two ounces stayed at 5 5 cents,
and the per ounce rate above 1
ounce went down a penny from
22 to 21 cents.

The cost of mailing postcards
(20 cents) remained the same.

Tytke said there are cost
trade—offs _in the new rates. Al-
though rate increases were an-
nounced for bulk mail pre—sorted

by 3-digit (up 5 .3 percent) and 5- ,

digit (up 12.9 percent) zip codes,
the non—proﬁt bulk mail basic
rate decreased by 8.3 percent,
from 16.9 cents to 15.5 cents per
unit. “There’s just about an equal
trade—off in costs between these
two based on the volume of bulk
mailwe do,” he said.-

Tytke cautioned that there is
no quick formula for calculating
the cost an individual office may
have to bear. “I don’t want a
department to be saying, c ‘Be-
cause the ﬁrst-class [first—ounce]
rate is up 3 percent, we’ll have a
3 percent overall extra cost from
last year.’ It depends on the vol-
ume, the number of pieces, what

they weigh, a whole number of 3

things,” Tytke said.
High—volume mailing offices
such as Admissions and Finan-

cial Aid, the Registrar’s ofﬁce .

and Public Affairs have been

_notified of the rate increases, he

said. .

Mailing Services plans to dis-
seminate rate information cam-
pus-wide, including announce-
ments to deans and department
heads and posted ﬂyers in cam-
pus- buildings’ mail sorting
rooms.

Tytke added that his unit of- .

fers customized guidance to de-
partments on request. Mailing
Services gets an average of 3 0-40
calls» a week with requests for
advice from University depart-
ments and individuals, he said.
“We do want departments to
have some idea, for their budget
planning and so forth,” Tytke
‘said. “But, you have to realize,
the postal service sets standards
of what has to be mailed first-
class: statements, invoices,
printed matter that goes to stu-
dents, so in some classifications
there isn’t any leeway.”
Because only the ﬁrst—class
first ounce rate went up, he said

1 his office has begun delineating

the amount of first—class mail the

University sends out at one ounce
and at more than one ounce,
something that had not been
tabulated in the past.

Pitt will not be affected by
the increase in periodical bulk
mail rate, used by magazine and
newspaper publishers, or the in-
crease in express mail costs.

“We do not mail at the peri-

odicals bulk rate,” Tytke said. .

Periodicals such as Pitt Maga-
zine, a quarterly with a mailing
list of some 200,000, are mailed
straight non—proﬁt bulk, he said.

‘The University contracts
with UPS for its express mail
delivery service and rates are

negotiated with the carrier, he .

added.

$14.3 million grant
funds gene therap
use in cardiovasc ar
disease treatment

- itt has received a $14.3 V
million, five—year
. grant to treat cardio-

vascular diseases using gene ‘

therapy. , .

‘The grant from the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
(NHLBI) establishes the
University’s Cardiovascular
Gene Therapy Center to over-

see clinical and laboratory stud-

ies aimed at_ healing poorly func— .

tioning hearts and preventing
long-term damage to blood ves-
sels, among other projects. .

In addition, Pitt’s Human
Gene Therapy Applications
Laboratory will become the only
national facility producing viral
vectors (agents that carry genes
into cells) for use in future

NHLBI—funded clinical trials.,

The grant also will fund training
of clinical scientists in the latest
gene therapy technologies and
procedures. .

“There are two stumbling
blocks in the clinical phase of
gene therapy research. Oneis

paying for the clinical trial itself, 

and the other is paying for the
production of clinical- grade vec-
tor material that goes into the
patient. This grant covers both,”

, said Joseph Glorioso, principal -‘

investigator for the grant and

chairperson of molecular genet-

ics and biochemistry. - 7”’

“Unlike many gene therap A‘

grants, which are largely pre-
clinical —— in other words, devel-
oping technology and‘ showing

efficacy in animal models — this I

one is actually targeted toward
patients,” Glorioso said. _.

Just in the last year, Pitt has
attracted $30 million in new
grant support _for gene therapy
research, he noted.

Researchers say gene therapy '

has great potential to treat and

prevent a variety of cardiovascu- -

lar diseases ofthe heart, lungs,
blood ‘vessels and blood. I
Pitt’s NHLBI grant is the
largest’ of four awarded nation-
ally. Other recipients included
Stanford, Cornell and the Uni-
versity of Washington at Seattle.
. Despite advances in preven-
tion, diagnosis and treatment,
cardiovascular disease remains
the No. 1 cause of death in the

United States. For example,"

heart failure affects more than
ﬁve million people, accounting
for one million hospitalizations,
400,000‘deaths and $40 billion
in health care expenses each year.

l\Teasures taken to alleviate Pitt  
computer networking problems

CONTINUED FROM PAGE I

About 1,000 Pitt faculty
members are trained in use of
the software, and the package
serves about one—third of the stu-
dent population, according to the
University’s technologyweb site.

, In recent weeks, Pitt has up-

graded the Courselnfodatabase
indexes, which store, sort and
control the flow of information
among users. _ v

“We have had no reports’ of
Courselnfo problems [during the
first week of the new term] and
we anticipate none,” Pack said.
He added that A the latest
Courselnfo program, Black-

board 5.0, is expected to be up’
, and running by the fall, in antici-
_ pation of greater faculty use.

Pack acknowledged that a
contract with an information se-r-
vice provider (ISP) to improve
remote network access has not
been ﬁnalized, but said Pitt is
expected to announce a new
agreement by the end»of]anu—
ary. Negotiations have been sty-

mied throughout the fall.

Under the proposed ISP deal,
members of the University com-
munity would be given the op-
tion of paying a monthly fee for
better remote access to their e-
mail, the_web and other services

- ' available through Pitt’s network.

Faculty particularly have
complained about delays in re-

- mote access availability.

The University plans to mail
information on ISP subscriber
options once the deal is final-
ized, Pack said. _ ~

The provost—ordered net-
work analysis will helpguide the
technical policy committee’ that
Vice Provost Pack chairs. The
committee includes faculty rep-
resentatives plus staff from Com-
puting Services and Systems De-_
velopment (CSSD) and the Cen-
ter for Instructional Develop-
ment and Distance Education.

Following the replacement
this month of 176 older analog
modems (among the 800 total

. modems that Pitt maintains) with

digital modems, the committee
is expected to implement poli-
cies enforcing modem "connec-
tion time limits and the elimina-
tion of concurrent connections
by single users. A ,
The computer network

analysis was completed in No-

vember under the direction of
Jinx Walton, director of CSSD,
who oversees the newly consoli-
dated division 'that includes
CSSD and Network Services.

Among other information,
the recently completed analysis
of the network showed that:

° The average remote access
session time is 41 minutes.

° Connection time for 92 per-
cent of all users is less than 2
hours. «

° Despite a 43 percent in-
crease in the modem pool capac-
ity, the saturation point contin-
ues to be reached during evening,

peak hours (8 p.m. to midnight). .

° About 16,000 users access
the modem pool monthly.

° About 60 percent of the‘
modem pool usage is by students‘

and 40 percent by faculty and
staff. , A

’The data are posted on the
University’s technology web site
(www.pitt.edu/
technology.html). The web site
also posts up—to—da'te announce-
ments of computer network
news.

RESEARCH NOTES

Pitt reports
best gene

A delivery of

protein a missing
in Duchenne
Muscular
Dystrophy

. Pitt scientists have engi—.
V neered perhaps the best gene

therapy to date for Duchenne

'Muscular Dystrophy (DMD),_

the catastrophic muscle—wasting
disease that strikes thousands of
boys in the United States/each
year.

The Pitt team whittled down
the largest gene ever found (14
kilobases) and packaged its most
important components (less than
4.2 kilobases) into the smallest
— and arguably the safest -
viral vector ever used for gene
therapy. _ I _

With this work the investiga-

V - tors demonstrated, for the first

time, the minimal amount of the
dystrophin gene needed to
achieve functionalmuscle. The

gene vector used was a geneti-

cally engineered form of adeno-

associated virus, or AAV.
VVhen injected into the calf

muscles of mice unable to natu-

rally produce the dystrophin‘pr.o—i

tein, the “mini—gene” construct

I . resulted in the expression of func-

tional dystrophin protein in al-
most 90 percent of the muscle
tissue treated. The dystrophin
expression lasted at least one year
—— the duration of the experi-
ments.

V “This gives us great hope that

‘ we can use this gene therapy

strategyin a larger animalrnodel
of DMD and eventually treat
patients within several years,”
said Xiao Xiao, assistant profes-
sor in Pitt’s molecular genetics
and biochemistry department.
“With this work, Dr. Xiao
and his laboratory have really
taken the AAV vector to a new
level in its ‘application to the
‘treatment of DMD,” said Jo-
seph Glorioso, chairperson of

I the Department of Molecular

Biochemistry and Genetics at
Pitt and vice president of ‘the
American Society of_Gene
Therapy.-“At the same time, he

has shown exactly what compo— 

nents of the4 dystrophin gene
product are necessary for its lo-
calization and functional activ-
ity in muscle cell membranes.” A

The mini-gene AAV and a
new technology recently devel-
oped in Xiao’s laboratory may
also be applicable to other ge-
netic disorders involving unusu-

ally large genes, according to Pitt .

researchers.

. Considered the most com-
mon genetic ailment, Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy strikes one
of every 3,500 'boys worldwide.

‘ It causes progressive muscle

weakening and death, usually
before age 20. No effective
therapy exists for the disease.
Central to this research ac-
complishment was the work of

research associate Bing ‘Wang .

and senior, research associate

Juan Li. Wang and Li treated

DMD.mice with one of three
mini—gene constructs. Each
mini-geneconstruct contained a
truncated version of the full
dystrophin gene. Based on in-
vestigations performed previ-
ously in other university labora-

tories, Xiao’s group selected cer-

tain sections of the dystrophin
gene known to produce regions
of the protein essential to its func-
tion. DMD mice treated with
the rnini—gene constructs showed
evidence of stable, f_unctional
dystrophin, and their muscles did
not- degenerate, as typically is
the case. Although all three mini-
gene constructs were effective in
terms of reducing signs of muscle
regeneration, one mini—gene in
particular was best at entering
the greatest number of muscle
cells. . I
In a next step, Xiao’s. labora-
torywill collaborate with other
investigators in testing the AAV
mini—gene construct in a .dog
.-model of DMD. Other research
initiatives-include developing the
best ways of delivering the DMD-
mini—gene systemically, as op-
posed to performing localized
injections.
Support for the research came
‘from the National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal
and Skin Diseases and from the
Parent Project, a national ‘orga-
nization founded by parents.

, whose children have Duchenne

or Becker Muscular Dystrophy.

UPIVIC. to test
ene therapy
or blood
vessel grolnrth
The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center is one of six cen-
ters participating in a Genzyme
Surgical Products—sponsored
clinical trial of a gene therapy

designed to promote the growth . I

of new blood vessels from exist-
ing bl‘o‘dd‘v'essels‘around blocked
coronary arteries. M

The Phase 1 study will evalu-
ate the safety and efﬁcacy of a
gene therapy based on an engi-
neered form of the gene known
as hypoxia inducible factor one
alpha. HIF-la has been shown
in laboratory studies toturn on
the expression of many proteins
associated with the natural pro-
cess of blood vessel formation
called angiogenesis.

While angiogenesis takes
place when restricted vessels
cause tissues to be deprived of
oxygen, the process often is not
sufficiently robust for, adequate
blood flow. The..HIF-1a prod-
uct will be administered to pa-
tients with coronary artery dis-

-ease undergoing bypass surgery ’
who have an area of the heart .

that is not suitable for surgical
revascularization. It’s hoped that
the gene will stimulate a more
stable and robust process of blood
vessel formation.
_ Kenneth R. McCurry, as-
‘ sistant professor of surgery in
the division of cardiothoracic
surgery at Pitt’s School of Medi-
cine, is principal investigator at
the Pittsburgh study site.

The HIF—1a trial is distinct
among cardiovascular gene
therapies in development be-
cause HIF—1a turns on a cascade
of proteins associated with blood
vessel formation rather than
single proteins. In addition,
Genzyme researchers have en-
gineered HIF-1a to increase its
potency. ‘

The six centers involved in
the study, including Pitt, will
enroll 20-25 patients in the
double-blind clinical trial in
which patients, during their by-

pass surgery, will be randomized
to receive either a placebo medi-
cation orone of four doses of the

study medication consisting of -

an adenovirus vector with the
gene that codes for HIF—1a.
vCo—inves.tigators working’
with McCurry are Bartley P.
Grifﬁth, the Henry T. Bahnson
Professor of Surgery and chief of
cardiothoracic surgery; Joon
Sup Lee, assistantlprofessor of
medicine, division of cardiology;
William P. Follansbee, profes-

sor of medicine, division of car-

diology, 'and Diana ZaIdon_is,-

the study’s coordinator.

In addition to Pitt, other study
sites are Evanston Northwest-
ern Medical Center in Evanston,

Tamoxifen for
breast cancer
prevention has
no effect on
heart .
Tamoxifen, a drug used to
prevent breast cancer, does not
increase cardiovascular risk in
healthywomen orinwomenwith
coronary heart disease, accord-
ing to a study published in the

Jan. 3 Journal _of the National
Cancer Institute.

The study, the largest clini-
cal trial to assess the cardiovas-
cular risk of tamoxifen, is part of
the National -Surgical Adjuvant
Breast and Bowel Project Breast
Cancer Prevention Trial.

“We found that cardiovascu— ’

lar event rates were not statisti-
cally_ signiﬁcantly different be-
tween women assigned to
tamoxifen or placebo, indepen-
dent of pre—existing: coronary
heart disease,” said Steven Reis,
principal investigator ‘in the
study, associate professor of

medicine and director of the"
' Women’s Heart Center at

UPMC Health System’s- Car-
diovascular Institute.
Cardiovascular events in-
cluded fatal and non—fatal myo-
cardial infarction, unstable an-
gina and severe angina.
Between 1992 and 1997,
13,3 88 women, at increased risk
for breast cancer were randomly
assigned to receive tamoxifen o'r

a placebo. After four years, car-

diovascular follow—up was avail— '
able forl 3, 1 94 women. Of them, .

1,048 had a prior history of clini-
cal coronary heart disease such
as heart attack or- angina and

_ 12,1 46 women reported no such

history.

‘ The study found thatlwomen
who had coronary heart disease
when they entered the study had

a higher rate of cardiovascular

events than the women without
heart problems. However, within
each group, there was no differ-
ence in the rate of cardiovascular
events between those receiving
tamoxifen and those receiving a
placebo.

“Although the event rates in
the group of women with a prior
history of heart disease are
greater than those observed in
the group of women without a
history. of heart disease, these
data demonstrate that assign-
ment to tamoxifen did not affect
cardiovascular events in this high
risk population, ” Reis reported]

For the past seven years,
Connolly, an assistant professor
of physics and astronomy, has
worked on the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS),.which will map

one-quarter of the entire sky,.

determining the positions and
brightness of more than 100 mil-
lion celestial objects. The SDSS
telescope also will measure the
distances to more than a million
galaxies and quasars. '_

“One goal of the project is to
develop a virtual observatory.
Rather than going to an obser-
vatory, researchers will have their

own telescope on their com— «
- puter,” Connolly said. “Weare

trying to develop a system that
will be effective and accessible
for astrophysicists and graduate
students as well as undergradu-
ates and even high school stu-
dents.”

Connolly investigates how
galaxies. form and how gravity

I causes them to cluster in the sky.

He has developed techniques for
estimating galaxy properties that
could reveal their age and how
they evolved.

$100,000  to fund equipment

A Pitt alumna has given the
ﬁrst gift to the University that

will endow equipment in the .—

planned Multi-Purpose Aca-
demic Complex (MPAC).
Deborah Jeanne Gillotti has
pledged $100,000 to the Depart-
ment of Computer Science,
which will be housed in the new
academic building. ~-
Scheduled to open in 2002,

A MPAC will be a six—story facility

on Forbes Avenue, across South
Bouquet Street from the Law
Building. A '

The DeborahJeanne Gillotti
Endowed Equipment Fund will
furnish the Interactive Learning
Suite, providing the most so-
phisticatedand up—to-date soft-

. ware and equipment available for

student and departmental ‘use.
Gillotti, a 1977 Pitt graduate
who earned dual degrees in eco-
nomics and history, has served as
the chief information ofﬁcer for
Starbucks Coffee Company and
most recently as chief operations

ofﬁcer for Viathan Corporation.

I In announcing her gift,
Gillotti ‘said it’s important for
women in leadership positions
to be active and.-visible, espe-
cially in high-tech fields. “I
wanted to sponsor something
physically tangible and accessible
on campus — something that
could really make a difference
for students in the information
technology ﬁeld,” she said. “I
hope my gift will inspire other
alumni to consider similar be-
quests.”

Rami Melhem, chair of com-
puter science, said, “Both un-
dergraduate and graduate com-
puter science students will ben-
eﬁt from this facility, which will

be used for teaching Java and‘

web—based networking, advanced
computer graphics and interac-
tive collaborative computing.”
The Gillotti endowment is
part of Pitt’s capital campaign.
The University hopes to raise
$500 million byJuly 2003. I

Gift funds GSPIA 2 -year
pilot program in ethics

Pitt"s Graduate School of '

Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA) has received a $75,000
gift from .LaVonne. and Glen
Johnson to fund a two—year pilot
program on ethics and account-
ability in public and nonproﬁt

organizations.

The gift is the ﬁrst step by the

Johnsons to establish a trust for

‘ GSPIA. that will permanently

support a program addressing
issues of ethics and accountabil-
ity. LaVonne_Iohnson earned her
master’s degree in public admin-
istration from GSPIA in 1980.
The program, to be based in
GSPIA, will incorporate ethical
issues faced by domestic and in-
ternational leaders._ A partner-

: ship with several other schools at

Pitt will integrate issues facing
the private sector.

' According to GSPIA Dean
‘Carolyn Ban, the pilot program
will feature three components:

° A lecture series on ethics
and accountability, featuring
‘prominent speakers from
academia as well as leaders from
government, nonproﬁt ‘and pri-
vate sector organizations to

stimulate public dialogue among
scholars, policymakers, journal-
ists, students, public administra-

tors‘, watchdog organizations and ‘

the public; -
° A regional conference on

. teaching ethics and accountabil-

ity consistingof two days of pa-
pers and panels for faculty from
educational institutions in the
tri-state area interested in devel-

oping and teaching courses on 4

these issues, and , ,
° An international conference
on policy and research issues re-
lated to ethics, accountability and
social responsibility in the pub-

lic sector, designed to bring to—;

gether leading experts from the
U.S. and Europe.
“This pilot ,program will al-

‘ low GSPIA'to build on its capac-

ity to mobilize resources to ad-
dress ethics and accountability
issues ——-whether in university
teaching, public policy or ad-
ministrative practice,” -said Ban.
