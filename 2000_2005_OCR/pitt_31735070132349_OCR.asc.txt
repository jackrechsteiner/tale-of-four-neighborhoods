MARIAH MOORE KHANNA
Staff Writer

The words “Under the Tuscan Sun” ran

’ on the screen over the entrance of Theater

10, but the entertaimnent seen last Sunday
morning was not made in Hollywood.

Loews Cineplex Theater at the
Waterfront was providing religion in the
form of a non-denominational Christian ser-
vice -— on the big screen.

The Waterfront Christian Community.
has rented space from the cinema for the last
six weeks. In return, the group gets surround
sound, seats that accommodate the parish-
ioners’ morning cotfee, and, of course, the
“big picture,” with words to and from God.

Across the screen in bold letters read,
“Open the eyes of my heart,_ Lord,” while
footage of sunsets, cloudy skies and
American ﬂags was shown in the back-
ground There are no texts to read from at

Rodriguez talks
about America,
the color brown

HAL1 FELT
Staff Writer

Brazilian Portuguese has 300 words
for the color brown.

English has only one. V

Richard Rodriguez spoke about this
and a multitude of other implications of
the color brown to a crowded auditorium

in David Lawrence Hall on Monday,

night, as part of the Pittsburgh
Contemporary Writers series.

Drawing from his experiences as_ a
child in Sacramento, up to his current
interactions with people of various cul-
tures, Rodriguez slowly filled in the lines
of what became, by the end of the night,
a vivid portrayal of modern, integrated
America. ,

S’ America, Rodriguez said, “is not a
country that likes to talk about brown.”

Though not a country that likes to
talkabout brown,’ America is, he said, a
country in which things have been
“browning” for a long time. The United
States presents its mu1ti—racial citizens
with quite a predicament, he added. .

“When I tell you that Pittsburgh is
browning, that the World is browning, I
am not talking about Richard Rodriguez.
I am talking about you, and you, and
you,” he said, pointing to people in the
audience. _ '

Dwelling on the topic of the individ-
ual rather'than discussing an idealized
picture of what it means to be acertain

race, Rodriguez minimized the individ-

ual only to make a point, with a dry sense
of humor, about the subtlety of stereo-
types: ' l . .

The browning of America has been a
subject about which Rodriguezhas writ-
ten, though sometimes indirectly, since
his first book, “Hunger of Memory,”.was
published in 1982 . ,

“Brown means that we engage all

-- the issues of our lives, the issues of con-

the Waterfront church. Instead, one must
watch the screen for instruction, just as any
good moviegoer would. '

“We are trying to make things more
contemporary,” said Gray Drent, the
church’s pastor. He added that having his
congregation meet at the Waterfront, ‘near
Homestead, made things easy for everyone.

“They can come, go to church, go to a
movie, go shopping,” he said, adding that
the site of his service”makes it a “destination
churc 

Aynsley Diemert, a spokeswoman for
the church, said that its use of more modern‘
ideas was a “learning experience.” Diemert
said many people have needed some time to
get used to the contemporary music that the
church uses in place of traditional hymns.

In the congregation of about 40 people,
ranging from those with paciﬁers to those
with walkers, few. sang along. The music
conductor, a woman with a microphone,

moved and sang energetically, but often, it ‘

was a one-woman performance.

The day’s sermon also contributed to
the contemporary atmosphere. Drent used
props to illustrate the idea of being a real
Christian, versus maintaining the appear-
ance of one. He covered a hot dog with
chocolate syrup ——_ from a bottle that read
“ketchup.”

From his church in a theater, Drent also

  

discussed in his sermon the disappointment
that can result when things aren’t what they
seem. . A

Drent’s congregation, which has grown
from a dozen people meeting in homes to
about 60 people who come to his Waterfront
services, is not the only church located in an
entertainment atmosphere. In Butler,
Pennsylvania, a congregation meets in a

‘ Carmike Cinemas facility. ,
Drent commented on this new trend

with the enthusiasm of a pastor.

“I’d like to have people just as happy at
church as Kennywood,” he said.

With a philosophy of causal dress and
sermons that incorporate ketchup and make
comparisons between God and power tools,
Drent is approaching a more accessible idea
of church — not just in terms of accessibili-
ty for those who use public transportation,
but for those who seek shows instead of lec-
tures. .

Diemert, who works at Pitt, said the

church leaders hope to eventually move the ‘

church ﬁom its 300-"seat theater to one that
seats 500. Until then, she said, they will need
to do advertising. Naturally, they’ll advertise
on the big screen. According to Diemert, the
church will be somewhere between popcorn
ads and previews, as soon as they have
enough money. _ '

tradiction, the sense of irony that we_ have
about our lives, the sense of inconsisten-
cy in our lives,” he said in April of 2002,‘
speaking on the Public Broadcasting
Service’s ,“Nev_vsHour” about his then-
new book, “Brown.”

On Monday night, Rodriguez used a
somewhat more subtle approach to
explain his message, but he achieved the
same effect. .

“If I am here tonight to speak posi-
tively of brown, then I must also speak
negatively,” Rodriguez said, going on to
speak about the “grandson of an observ-

new

ing Jew who chose Hitler’s birthday” to
go on a shooting spree at Columbine
High School, and the heavy weight that
children with parents of both,Muslim and
Jewish faith have to carry in a post~Sept.

Rodriguez ended the night with a
story that displayed an outward sense of
humor, but summed up the deeper mes-
sage of his talk. He described his nephew,
who is of Indian, American Indian, and
South American Indian descent. ’

“So the Indian Indian Indian is a
waiter in San Francisco, and everyone
tells him he looks Italian,” Rodriguez
said. -

Ashcroft’s plea bargain one-size—fits-none.

One-size-ﬁts-all clothing tends not
to ﬁt anyone. It either bunches, bags or
constricts, thus tending to be unﬂatter-
ing, and is not worth the time or money.

One—size-fits—all sentencing is
much the same — unﬁtting and inex-
act. And that’s what U.S. Attorney
General John Ashcroft is trying to cre-
ate. -
In an order issued by the Justice
Department, Ashcroft attempts to elim-
inate many forrns of plea bargaining in
federal cases. Plea bargaining allows
defendants to plead guilty to lesser
offenses and accept lighter prison sen-
tences, rather than go to trial.

This will prove useless at best,
harmful at worst. First, it will . send
more people to trial, and juries, know-
ing of these new, harsher standards,
may be more hesitant to convict. And
those they convict will be in prison a
long, long time.

Most federal crimes are white-col-

lar —— nonviolent ones that involve a
dash of embezzlement or a smattering
of money laundering. Not that these
should be taken lightly; they can leave
the victims penniless. .
‘ Still’, jail time does not cure this
pennilessness. Rather than instituting
some means of compensating victims,
Ashcroft wants to give money launder-
ers and their ilk more jail—tirne than
they receive through plea bargaining.

Jail is .supposed to rehabilitate

rather than simply censure. Wouldn’t
punishing _ more people for less time
achieve this end, and punishing fewer
people for more time defeat it?

Prosecutors use plea bargains to
save time and money part of that
lovely “speedy justice” thing the
United States so prides itself on —* and
to ensure that criminals -are punished,
even for lesser crimes. Putting limits on
plea bargaining limits prosecutorial
discretion, and further mechanizes the
justice system.

This move comes with plenty of
opposition, particularly from former
U.S. Attorney J. Alan Johnson. “The
effect [is]  turning judges, prosecu-
tors and defense attorneys into a bunch
of clerks,” he told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, in a Sept. 30 article.

To ensure a fair trial, checks and
balances between the Executive and
Judicial Branches —— the former over-
seeing prosecutors and the latter the
judges —- should be effective. Limiting
judicial power, particularly the power
to set sentences, via the Justice
Department circumvents one of those
crucial checks. ’ V _

Ashcroft should not be making
prosecutors follow .a paint-by-numbers
system for trying cases. For the punish-
ment to fit the crime, each case should
be treated with individual care and con-
sideration — and not done withorders
handed down from Ashcroft.

Sharnu has been very naughty lately.
While this line may spark interest in the
legions of bestiality fans out there, I am
referring to his dietary habits, and not to
any of his other biological activities. a

I» A new theory appearing in a recent
issue of PNAS, the National Academy of
Science’s paper, suggests that the recent‘
depopulation of sea lions, sea otters and

seals may be related to a man—made .

mishap in the food chain.
According to the report, because of the
increase in commercial whaling after
World War II, the numbers of large whales,
such as blue and humpback
whales, have thinned to levels -
low enough to cause killer
whales to switch from their
main source of nourishment,
the large whale, to the more
plentiful — and more cuddly
— sea lion, otter, and seal.
Most of you Sea World-
visiting, self-proclaimed
marine biologists out there
probably assume the killer
whale’s diet is made up pri— ’

  

lmarily of ﬁm—sized ﬁsh, and

the occasional tourist, thrown
by a park entertainer. .

This is like assuming that lions can
talk and all beautiful women are virgins
simply because you own the complete
Disney library on DVD. In reality-land,
killer whales are vicious sea predators,
Sirnba is in a cage, four feet on each side,
at the zoo, and Ariel didn’t exactly have to

- wait to get on land to spread her legs.

High school logic applies perfectly to
this situation. Humans, the bullies of
nature, stole the lunch monies of the killer
whale so many times that he has no choice
but to turn to an even weaker ﬁeshman
and, in turn, steal his. '

Since the killer whale must consume
300,000 calories each day, not only did we
steal his lunch money, but also his Rolex
watch, Beemer, posh apartment and super-

Dresses, toenail polish, ballet do not diminish masculinity

My junior year of high school, my sister Keely
— then in her senior year — was doing some inex-
plicable project for school, apparently requiring her
and a friend to dress up in 15-year-old clothing
belonging to my mother, then to take pictures of each
other. V

Now, in my family, we rarely did projects by our-

selves. When Kelley, who is a year older than Keely,

had a biology project, I felt obliged to make the pro-
ject require twice as much work by insisting that it
should be done on Mario Paint and recorded on
video. I’m, pretty sure she got an A, even though her
two weeks of experimental plant growth were con-
densed to about 12 hours.

And, of course, I felt no less of a commitment to
Keely’s project.

When pictures of me in skirts and jewelry, wear-
ing lipstick, eyeliner and mascara, were passed
around to my friends, teachers and my ex—girlfriend,

I was amused but adamant: anyone but Dad could see '

those pictures.

I don’t know if he ever did see them, but I know
he knows about my toenail painting. I recently doffed
my shoes in front of a woman with whom he is

' friends. Theywere painted a vaguely pewter color

with purple racing stripes.

The first time I painted my toenails was my
senior year of high school, about the same time that I
borrowed a car to “go to the library to study” about
twice a week. At the end of the marking period, my
grade-point average was something like 'a-.C,-, so I
gather he knows I wasn’t studying. I was actually
leaving to go to rehearsals for, and eventually perfor-

mances of, “The Nutcracker.” j
By no means did I have secret dreams of being a
ballerina. My friend Dawn was in the ballet company
in question and asked me ifI would take a small role.
My mother and sisters knew, but not Dad; And
why not? .

Well, in the words of his friend who spotted my
nail polish, “What are you, some kind of f——ing
queer?” I

I This is really the only conclu-
sion that one could draw in such a
situation, short of deciding that I
was actually a ‘woman. As every-
one knows,when you go to a store
and try to buy, nail polish, ' they
demand photographic records of
you having sex with a man.

called gay. What really upsets me

my-senior year just to make the golf team. Kelley
also hunts and fishes, and I have quit both.

When I was still a hunter, I saw Kelley grab a

wounded deer by the head, slit its throat, then burst

into laughter; she had blood on her hands and cheek.
All in all, a very Hemingway moment.

There’s really no contest. Kelley is twice the man
that I am. '

My role in “The Nutcracker” wasn’tdiff1cult,
but I nailed it. I nailed it exactly the way I didn’t
nail my performance in any game for the first
two seasons I played little league football and
baseball. My teams did not win. a single game
those two years. a

Yes, the ballet was great fun, and significant-
ly less emasculating than the pee-wee football

to mention the implication that being homosexual
makes you less of a man. Granted, the woman in
question comes from a time when such ideas were
not yet widely regarded as ignorant.

The problem is that my father does, too:

I suppose he knows as little as he does about such
aspects of my life because I’ve always thought that
he places a great deal of emphasis on traditional mas-
culinity, and I don’t want him to think I’m not a man.

Despite being the only male child in my family, I
face some stiff competition in terms of traditional
masculinity. My sister Kelley, for instance, lettered in

ed the team party, that was the tape they put in

— though by no means intentionally. 
My father came to see almost all of my football,
baseball and basketball games, no matter how poorly

I played. I can only wonder if he would have come to '

see me in a ballet. As I remember, we brought the
house down. ’ ,
If only I had been man enough to ask him.

Suicide on stage: making a spectacle of death inFlorida

The council unanimously voted to outlaw
suicide conducted for “entertainment pur-
poses,” spurred to action by the industrial
band Hell On Earth, whose controversial
plan to conduct an onstage suicide pro-
voked community outrage.

“While I still think it’s a publicity
stunt, we still couldn’t sit idly by and-let
someone lose their life,” said Bill Foster, a
council member quoted in Associated
Press reports. For right-to-die advocates, of
course, Foster used the wrong verb, imply-
ing the man committing suicide would be
losing his life, rather than choosing to take
It.

Hell On Earth, whose principled
stands for artistic freedom have included
sodomizing skinned calves and putting
dead rats in a blender, vowed to continue
the show as promised. '

“This is about standing up for what
you believe in, and I am a strong supporter
of physician-assisted suicide,” says front
man Billy Tourtelot on the band’s Web
page. .There’s no explanation as to why
skinned calves are better for sodomizing.

_ The planned suicide, a terminally ill
member of the Euthanasia Society, wants
to raise awareness about dying with digni-
ty. To do so, he will die on stage with a

might be biased, because all of their songs
make me wish for’death.

Said the would-be suicide, “I thank the
Lord that Hell On Earth is giving me this
opportunity to end my suffer-
ing.” He doesn’t mention that the
band coincidentally has a new
album out, called “All Things
Disturbingly Sassy.” I suppose
he thought that would be crass.

Hold on a" second. Hasn’t
this been done before?

In 1998, during November
sweeps, 60 Minutes showed a
videotape of Dr. Jack Kevorkian _
killing terminally ill -Thomas
Youk by lethal injection. The same wave of
revulsion-slash-fascination swept through
the media-pundit world. When someone
dies on TV, they moaned, isn’t it just death
as entertainment, the ultimate spectacle? .

Actually, no. Suspend the peripheral
question of whether 60 Minutes had pan-
dered to a Jerry Springer audience, and

you’re left with the question of whether it

was right to let it happen. That’s a more

Happy Boy George Day. '

What? You don’t know about Boy George Day?
Some citizen of Pittsburgh you are. Everyone knows
who Boy George is _— lead singer of ‘80s staple
Culture Club, which won the 1983 Grammy for Best
New Artist. Boy George is a ﬂamboyant dresser, a
larger—than—life personality and, like so many other
“stars” of the ‘80s, a recovering drug addict.

Celebrate Boy George

In the fall of 2000, Boy George came to

Pittsburgh with the newly reformed Culture Club to
play a show at Metropol. Then-City Councilman
Jim Ferlo, now a state‘ senator, sponsored City
Resolution No. 901, declaring Oct. 1, 2000, “Boy
George ‘Tribute Day” in the city. of Pittsburgh.
According to a Sept... 20, 2000, Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette article, the resolution makes Boy George an
honorary Pittsburgher, but he doesn’t get a key to
the city, which can only be given by the mayor, or
special powers, like the ability to make citizen’s
arrests. ’

Can you imagine being arrested by Boy
George? _

The reason Resolution No. 901 was passed,
Ferlo said, was to honor George’s anti—drug mes-
sage and to “please Boy George’s fans.” The Post-
Gazette also ran a . A ’ - .   
piece that reported ' "
that Ferlo “sang the
opening» bars of
‘Do You Really
Hurt

   
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
   

   

  

mean that Ferlo, by
sponsoring the leg-
islation and doing
his impromptu
karaoke session, is
a fan of Boy  . . .,  . . ,
George’s 'work? I think it’s safe to say we have a
Boy George lover in Harrisburg. ’ _ _
‘To most people, Resolution No. 901 passed
under the radar despite the heavy press coverage.
The Post—Gazetteran four pieces on the resolution,
including an editorial where they referred to Ferlo
as “the well—known karma comedian,” and an inter-
View with George, in which he said “It’s very nice.

    

, I was like, OK. I’ve never had a Boy George Day

before.-I don’t know what it means you can get
away with. I won’t be taking advantage of it and
running through Pittsburgh in high ‘heels or any-
thing like that.” They also ran the actual resolution,
as it passed in city council. That’s a lot of ink to be
given to something like Boy George Tribute Day.
All of these articles can be accessed via the Post-
Gazette’s Web site by typing “Boy George” into the
site’s search box. They’re all worth reading.
0 But, unfortunately, no one has yet celebrated
Boy George Tribute Day in the city of Pittsburgh.
And why the hell not? It’s not everyday, or in every
city, that a citizenry can celebrate a day honoring an
‘80s icon.

God bless Jim Ferlo.

Boy George himself said that he’s never had a
day of his own anywhere, so we owe it to him to

every Oct. 1. It’s time that the decent, hard-working

people of Pittsburgh took time out to observe the

musical legacy of Boy "George and his achievements
in overcoming addiction. Think of it as celebrating
what we Pittsburghers usually celebrate — the ‘70s

and Lynryd Skynryd — except the shabby ‘70s are '

replaced with the excessive ‘80s, alcoholism is
replaced with heroin addiction, and Skynryd is now
a ﬂamboyant, cross-dressing, gay man instead“ of a
rough-around-the—edges country boy with a mullet.
How does ' one celebrate Boy George Day?
There are numerous ways. You can go the unorigi-
nal route and play his music. Hearing “Do You
Really Want to Hurt Me?” and ‘-‘Karma Chameleon”

blaring from stereos citywide would be a good first” ‘

step. » _ .

However, because ‘80s music is making a
comeback, hearing Culture Club music isn’t as rare
as it was in, say, the ‘90s, so people might miscon-
strue your intentions — you’re not really celebrat-
ing Boy George so much as being nostalgic.

No, we need to find other ways. You should

,.make gifts of Boy 5‘ﬁGeorge "and Culture Club CDs;

give them to friends and family. I’m sure everyone
would love to receive acopy of Colour By Numbers,

 
 
   
 
 

Tribute Day

Waking Up with the House on Fire or, for those
unfamiliar with Boy George’s work, At Worst The
Best of Boy'George and Culture Club.

And for those who are absolute die—hard fans of
the man and his band, you can make Oct. 1 the day
you scour thrift shops for vinyl versions of the
albums, either as gifts or for your own collection —-
though, if you’re a fan, you should already own
these albums in every form.

You can also tailor your Oct. 1 outﬁt to Boy
George styles. There are plenty of sites on the
Internet that have pictures of Boy George during the
‘80s, as well as images of his still-ﬂamboyant style
— he dressed like an ancient Egyptian hieroglyph
on “The Tonight Show” a few nights ago —— so you
can pick out your favorite style for the big day. This
would take a little work, I would imagine, so it
would meanyou would have to plan ahead if you
wanted to dress up. I ‘

We can send letters to Jim Ferlo in Harrisburg,

land-
scape of -acity
trying to rede-
fine itself, like
Pittsburgh. We
can make Boy George Day greeting cards and send
those to him. Maybe if enough people write, e-mail
or send cards, to him, we’ll get a statewide Boy
George Day now that he’s a state senator. And imag-
ine the national implications if Ferlo ever gets into

V the U.S. Congress.

A parade would be out of the question, at least
right now, thanks to the city’s budget concerns. But
we can petition our local leaders for something
down the road, when Pittsburgh’s finances improve.
Or we can hold our own parade, the way runners
held the Great Replacement Race when the Great
Race was cancelled.

These are just a few ideas. With a little ingenu-
ity, we can come up with more, even better ones.

But it all starts today, Wed.,,Oct. 1, 2003. This
is the first celebration of Boy George Day. And even
if the festivities don’t ﬂower that far from these
pages of The Pitt News this year, everyone will now
be aware of it so, next year, everyone can celebrate
and not have the excuse of “I didn’t know about it.”

With any luck,’ in a few years, and thanks to this

» first annual honoring of Boy George Day, Oct. 1

will be a day that Pittsburghers mark on their calen-
dars as a day to remember and observe the many
accomplishments of the man, the myth, the legend
— Boy George. ’ .

Aaron Lewis of Staind saw
something special in the five mem-‘
bers of rock band Lo Pro when he
decided" to sign them to his label,
413 Records. Lo Pro didn’tjust drop
out of the sky, though. Two of the
band members, Pete Murray (vocals)
and Neil Godfrey (guitar), played in

V the band Ultraspank throughout the

‘90s and attained a moderate amount
of fame. They gave up on
Ultraspank because of shady record
label politics that they didn’t want-to
be a part of. Eventually, they found
Tommy Stewart (drums), Pete Ricci
(guitar)_ and John Fahnestock (bass)
and began Lo Pro.’ /_

Lo Pro’s debut album, which is
named for the band,’ is meticulous in
that every guitar riff and drum beat
fits into the grand scheme of the
album precisely. Most of the songs,
especially “Sunday” and “Ignition,”
are driven by a wailing guitar.
Instrumentally, Lo Pro’s songs are

inspired with different backbeats.

» pain of the

Gray music to wallow in

and interesting breakdowns.
Unfortunately, as different as the
background music is from song to
song, lead singer Pete Murray’s
vocals strain the ears and are monot-
onous. One could find a certain

- solace in the silent spaces between

songs where your head has enough
time to stop ringing from the
screaming emotion in his voice.

On the positive side, Murray
does emit strong feelings through
his vocals and makes you feel the
lyrics, which are
extremely complex and deep. The
lyrical highlight on the album is on
“Thread.” Murray sings, “I weath-
ered another storm but it’s not the
last one/ I know this isn’t over, I
know it’s just begun/ I feel it getting
stronger, I see clouds behindgthe
sunl Breath out; take it- all in.
Patience gone south and the cycle
begins.”

There is a theme of depression"

and despair that runs throughout the
album, finding no~resolution, even ‘at
the end; Overall, the album is
mediocre. Listening to Lo Pro
makes you feel like you are walking
down the streets of Pittsburgh dur-
ing a rainy day — everything is just
gray. ’ '

What A Perfect Circle gives us
this time around is a concept album
anchored more by evocative themes’
and hypnotic melodies. than by
brazen lyrical venom and grinding
metal. It’s a convoluted story about
attempting to recover from a state of

the ambivalence, rage,_ longing and
utter loneliness that’ characterize a
punctuated emotional and intellectu-
al transition. It would make for
impeccable’ breakup music, but it’s so
emotionally raw and pure that it
would be slanderous to pigeonhole it
as an album about just that.

Lyrically, Thirteenth Step is bipo-
lar, oscillating between an almost
uncomfortable level of sincerity and
a pitch of irony so smart and taunting
that it’s difficult to distinguish the
album’s most earnest moments from
its most perverse. The confusion only
adds to the album’s emotional poten-
cy. , . 3

The thematic trajectory is pro-
duced not only by the brilliant lyrics
but by the sonic approach, as well.
Sometimes stripped down and sim-
ple, sometimes textured with infinite
complexity and other times synthetic
and tinny, the sound-scape is as
dynamic and varied as the dichoto-
mous lyrical voices. Standout tracks
“The, Package,” “The Noose” and
“Pet” manage to be all of the above.

all of these women. Whether it is
expressed through images or
through words, foliage is being
honored and nurtured. The gallery
reinvents itself as a kind of tribute
to the lush outside world. It truly is
a “garden inside;” the photographs
are what Sue Abramson, in the com-
ments she posts beside her prints,
describes as a “surrogate space for
those times you can’t be in your

yard.”
To complement Abramson’s
images, Christina Worsing put

together books filled with Sherrie
Flick’s garden text —— a verbal con-
text to embellish the visual.
According to Flick, who co—found-
ed The Gist Street Reading Series,
“You are a small creature easily
fooled into believing the gazing ball
in the yard can tell the future if you
just give it enough time.” It seems,
looking at the pictures, that
Abramson does indeed try to tame
the natural world, or at least inter-
pret and share her experience of it.
Abramson’s black—and-white
prints are of ﬂowers, twigs and veg-
etables — including a four-print

and perspective. Her choice of tech-
nology is reflective of her tendency
to surrender power. Just as she
rejects the control-filled world of
digital technology, Labrise also
abandons authority in her own gar-
den, which is entirely self—seeded
and wild.

The images that result, with
their blurred distortions and ‘con-
torted scale, seem to imitate the

imagined perspective of an insect. 4

The viewer is thrown into the gar-
den, left disoriented, and forced to
examine the flowers for the intrin-
sic value: the color, the shape. This
surrender is in stark contrast to the
emphasis on taming that Sherrie
Flick expresses in her _writing.
Naturally, it becomes clear that the
experience of a garden — the rela-
tionship between plants and the gar-
dener who tends to them —— can
vary greatly from one artist to the
next. But regardless of the differ-
ences in technique and aesthetic
result, the photographs of Labrise
and Abramson both exhibit and glo-
rify intimacy with plants.

.The sense of communion with
nature that blankets this exhibit is
probably best articulated by Flick
herself: “The world is beautiful and
it is yours.”

The Pitt volleyball team won both of its,

' winners of five straight and nine out of their last

10.

In their first match, the Panthers (11-3 overall,
2-0 Big East) easily dispensed of Providence
College (1-16) in straight games. The second
match of the weekend proved to be more challeng-
ing, but after losing the first game, Pitt swept the
next three to defeat Boston College'(11-4, 1-1).

Universities should consider giving athletes a little more

A couple of weeks ago, I wit-
nessed one of Oakland’s most col-
orful panhandlers put on quite an
interesting performance.

I’m sure you’re all aware of the‘

older gentlemen who likes to yell at

people and things that the rest of us ' »

can’t reallysee. On this particular

occasion, this man was standing in ‘

front of King’s Court,gyelling at
something that had made him mad
and swinging his fists in rage;

My first thought was, “what
could have made him so upset?” My
second thought was more interested
with what he was wearing.

Many Panther fans and anyone
who has attended a Pitt football
game in the past five years would
have identified his No. 12 Pitt jer-
sey as that of Panther quarterback
Rod Rutherford’s home uniform.
Except for one thing.

Rutherford’s name isn’t on the
back. '

It’s the same way with the Pitt
jerseys hanging in the campus store
windows that have the Nos. 19, 25
and 32 on them. You might say
those‘ shirts belong to Shawntae
Spencer, Brandon Miree and
Lousaka Polite, but in actuality,
they’re just football jerseys.

No different are the No. 20 bas-

ketball jerseys that Pitt began sell- ~
ring after Brandin Knight started

making a name for himself two
years ago. Not only that, but you
can buy yourself a nutcracker wear-
inga basketball jersey with the No.
1 on it. You can tell yourself it’s
Julius Page, but there’s no nameon
the back — never mindthe fact that

’ it looks nothing like him. ‘’
So you might ask,‘.what’s the‘
' big ‘deal? So Pitt is making money

off of replica jerseys of Rutherford
and Knight. How is thatdifferent
than. any other article of clothing
fans buy? . I ’ ’

Well, since their likeness is not
beingjused —_ in this case, their
names — nothing is owed to the
players. 1

Of course that’s a good thing,

because if the players were being
paid royalties for the jerseys ‘and

other items that they help the uni— L
. versity sell, then they’d be ineligi-

ble, which brings me to my point:
college athletes should be paid. -
And by paid, I don’t. mean they
should receive the multi-million
dollar contracts that the profession-
als make. That wouldn’t ‘make
sense. ' I

_ But they should receive some '
compensation for the time and

effort that they spend making their
schools millions of dollars, esp_e-
cially if the school is going to use

their uniform numbers to make

 

money.

Many would argue that athletes
are already getting paid with a free
education, and in most ca'ses, that is

true. There are a lot of athletes who
will not have to pay a dime for their
college education because they can
catch a football or bounce a basket-
ball. ‘ '

,But there are also athletes that
walk—on to teams and get absolutely
nothingfor their services. They put
just as much time and effort into
their sport —— in some cases, more
— yet they still have to shell out
thousands of dollars for their educa-
tion. -I
And most of them don’t have
time to get a job. '

Between classes and their-sport,

\

most athletes put in as much work

as a normal student who has a part-

time job, if not more. So why
shouldn’t they get paid for their
extra work like those students do?”

It’s not like Pitt or any other
major university couldn’t afford it.
With the money made from ticket
sales, merchandising and alumni
donations, there has to be some
extra cash that can go towards sup-
plying athletes with a little extra
spending money. _

leges that theygneedwto give their

THE PITT NEWS

Pelusi records her third career
shutout in Pitt’s win over Dukes

Soccer, page 11

receiving a pass from forward Sara
Gutting, Senger put in the shot from
25 yards out.

Hills put the nail in the coffin
late in the game, scoring on a direct
kick at 89:47 to give "Pitt a 3-0
advantage and secure the win for the
Panthers.

The Panthers offense produced
an impressive five goals over the
weekend to pick up both victories.
But what was perhaps even more
notable was the play of goalkeeper
Jamie Pelusi, who registered a total

of 15 saves in the two games and"

earned her third career shutout.

“ Jamie played great all week-
end,” Chin said. “She made things
easy for us.”

Play continues for the Panthers
Friday, as they host Miami in what
begins a six—game home stand. This
is the first home‘ game for the
Panthers since a Sept. 6 win over
Maryland-Baltimore County.

“It’s great playing at home,”
Chin said. “It’s very important, with
the conference being as strong as it
is. The girls are excited to get back.”

Friday’s game against Miami is
scheduled to start at 7 p.m. and will
be played at Founders Field. 4,,

athletes a little more money would-
n’t be easy, and it probably won’t
happen for quite some time, if ever.

But it just doesn’t seem fair that
a school can use a number that
every fan knows belongs to a cur-

-rent player and make a profit with-

out giving anything to that player in
return. ’

And it’s not like it’s any kind of
accident that a jersey with Miree’s
number is hanging in a store win-
dow. The peoplewho came 'up with
the idea know what they’re doing.

That’s why Ohio State is still
selling jerseys with the No. 13 on
it. Forget the fact that Maurice

Clarett, who wore that number for

the Buckeyes last season, is sus-
pended and will probably never suit
up for Ohio State again. He’s the
Buckeyes most well-known player
—— despite the fact that he hasn’t
played all year —— and having that
number on a jersey means it’s going
to sell. -
As long as schools are going to
use a player’s number to help sell
more merchandise, then maybe they

should consider thanking their ath- v

letes by giving them a little more
than the opportunity to compete at
the next level.
