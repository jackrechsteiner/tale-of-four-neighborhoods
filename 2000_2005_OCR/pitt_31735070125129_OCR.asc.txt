Judge rules for-Pitt in
same-sex beneﬁts case;
2 sides mum on plans

ttorneys from the
ACLU said yester-

day that they haven’t

decided how to proceed follow-
ing an Allegheny County judge’s
ruling that Pitt does not discrimi-
nate by denying health benefits
to employees’ gay and lesbian
partners.’ ‘ V

Pitt officials, meanwhile,
we'ren’t sayingwhether they plan
to file for a permanent injunc-
tion’ in a further effort to kill the
four-year—old same-sex beneﬁts
civil suit. ‘

fairs. .

Hill declined further com-
\ment, ~refer_ring the University
Times to Pitt’s April '20 state-
ment. For the complete text of the
statement, see page 3 .

Christine Biancheria, an
ACLU attorney representing
plaintiffs in the case, said: “If the

_ University thinks that the fight
is over, they’re wrong. We’re
discussinga number of options,
which I prefer not to mention at
this point.”

An interested party in the
case, Pittsburgh Human Rela-
tions Commission (HRC) direc-
tor Charles Morrison, predicted
-yesterday that the _plaintiffs will
appeal the judge’s decision and

S. that Pitt will file for a permanent up

injunction. “It’s just from what
I’m hearing; I don’t have first-
hand knowledge. But I don’t
think it’s over yet,” Morrison
said. I

Common Pleas Court Judge
Robert C. -Gallo ruled April 20
that the HRC must stop investi-
gating allegations that the Uni-
versity has discriminated against
one formerand six current”em-
ployees in a gay rights case that
has drawn national attention.

Pitt argued that the legisla-

tion passed by the Pennsylvania
General Assembly in November
superseded the 1990 Pittsburgh

city ordinance on which the case S

was based.

House Bill 115 says in part:-

“An ordinance adopted by a
municipality which requires, or

the provision of _health insur-
ance or other employee health
care beneﬁts shall not apply to a

Deborah Henson,- a former
legal writing instructor at Pitt,
ﬁled a complaint injanuary 1996
alleging that the University dis-
criminated against her in em-
ployment by denying health’ben-
efits to her lesbian partner. The
1990 Pittsburgh Human Rela-

tions Act prohibits discrimina— -

tion in employment, including
discrimination in compensation,
on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion. Six current Pitt employees
subsequently joined Henson in a
class’ action suit. .

“To tell you the truth, I think
we’ve been unusually fortunate
in that we’ve survived this long
as an «East Coast observatory,
when virtually every other one
has closed down,” Gatewood
said. “Even the larger, ground-
based telescopes on mountain
tops are beginning to see the end
of their time. We’re really in the
space age now. ‘

Washington, D.C., and the
Smithsonian Observatory in
Cambridge, Mass., will crunch
data received from the Full-Sky
Astrometric Mapping Explorer
(FAME) space telescope that
NASA plans to launch in 2004.
Gatewood said FAME is ex-
pected to measure activity
around some 40 million stars “in—
stead of the few hundred stars

' that we’ve been able to cover.”

And FAME’s observations are
likely to be 20 times more pre-
cise than images produced ‘by
the Allegheny Observatory’s leg-
endary Thaw 30-inch photo-
graphic refractor, he said.

Allegheny also will apply to"

space telescope project planned
for later in the decade: the Space
Interferometer Mission (SIM),
aimed at detecting additional
planets. (Of the 32 known plan-

ets outside our solar system, two

Reiland.)

Allegheny’s NASA funding
could total as much as $170,000
annually by the end of the'de-

cade if the observatory’s SIM
and other funding applications
are approved, according to
Gatewood. A

Frank Tabakin, chairperson
of.Pitt’s physics and astronomy
department, said he’s “guardedly
optimistic” about the observa-
tory’s funding prospects.

“There have been many cases
in this department where re-

search ‘groups’ have temporarily

lost their funding, and then came
back very strong a'year or two
later,” he said. “If, every_time a
group lost its grant we closed up

~ shop, we’d be in pretty bad shape.
We would have ..closed some‘

major, successful componen-ts of
our department.” Tabakin de-
clined to specify those groups. “I
don’t want to name names'b_e-
cause they’re not .particularly
proud of having that interlude,”
he said, with a laugh.

Tabakin and Gatewood
voiced concern about an April

them, but the headline: “Allegh-

Wages, health care stumbling blocks in

negotiations between Pitt, custodians

ontract negotiations
c continue between the

University and Pitts-
burgh campus custodians, who
have been working without a
contract sincejan. 1.

According to representatives
from both sides, health care costs
and wages remain the ‘biggest
stumbling blocks to a settlement.

The two sides have met twice
this month, with the next bar-
gaining session scheduled for
today, April 27. _

Both sides are hoping for a
multi—year deal.

Pittsburgh campus custodi-
ans, including cleaners, mainte-
nance workers, groundskeepers
and pool operators, are mem-
bers of Division 29 (formerly
Local 29) of Local 585 of the
Service Employees International
Union, AFL—CIO.

Mike Salmon, Local 585

union representative and nego-
tiator, said, “We have resolved
some issues. We have contract

language agreement on layoffs

and the grievance process, for
example. I think we’re trying to
develop a responsible and prac-
tical working relationship with
the University. But health care
costs and wages are still the big
concern.”

According to Salmon, the
union membership is ﬂexible
about the source of the money
— increased wages or increased
health beneﬁts payments — “but
that the bottom line is workers
cannot afford the health plans.
In some cases, [paying for] fam-
ily coverage puts our workers
below the poverty line,” he-said.
“Family coverage, even at the
lowest rate of $110 a month,
would probably’ negate any in-
creases in wages.”

He added, “Pitt talks about
parity: ‘Everyone pays the same
$110 [for family coverage].’ But
of .[Chancellor Mark] Norden—
berg’s $265,000 salary, it’s less
than one-half of 1 percent. Yet
we’re asked to pay at least 6 per-
cent of our salaries. That’s not

' really parity.”

Pitt spokesperson Ken Ser-
vice, director of News and Infor-
mation, said, “From the Uni-
versity’s perspective we agree
that there’s been some -progress
in the negotiations, but the ma-
jor economic issues are still to be
resolved. The University feels
that we’ve offered a fair total
compensation package and we
are optimistic thatwe will be
able to reach an agreement.” He
declined to give speciﬁcs of the
package.

Salmon said Pitt’s recently
announced three-year deal with

Ernst Knobil, who was Rich-
ard Beatty Mellon Professor of
Physiology at Pitt from 1961 to

I 1981 and chairperson of the

medical school’s cell biology and
physiology department, died of
pancreatic cancer April 13,2000.
He was 73.

Knobil died at The Hospice
of the Texas Medical Center in
Houston.

A pioneering endocrinolo-
gist, Knobil located the pulse
generator for a hormone that
regulates reproduction. Subse-
quently synthesized, the hor-
mone has since helped many
women become pregnant.

Born in Berlin, Knobil grew
up in Paris and emigrated to the
United States in 1940 with his

parents. After serving in the US. ”

Army, he completed his doctor-
ate in zoology at Cornell in 1951.
He taught at Harvard before
coming to Pitt in 1961.

Knobil is credited with build-
ing the Pitt medical school’s De-
partment of Cell Biology and
Physiology into an internation-
ally recognized program during
his 20 years here. He also
founded Pitt’s Center for Re-

The center’s current direc-
tor, Tony Plant, worked with
Knobil as a post-doctoral fellow
and later as a fellow faculty mem-
ber. “He maintained high stan-
dards in everything he did,
whether it was as a researcher, a
teacher or an administrator,”
Plant said.‘ “He was very tough’
and very candid, but also very
fair.

“If you were writing a paper
with Ernst Knobil and youwrote
something that was irrational,
he let you know. He didn’t try to
spare your feelings. But many
people, including me, learned a
lot from his criticisms.”

Formal in his classroom man-
ner and dress, Knobil intimidated
some students, Plant recalled.
“His course on the physiology of
mammals was famous. In many
cases, it wasn’t until years later
that his students appreciated just
how much they’d gained from
that class,” Plant said.

“It was rigorous course,” said
former student[_Selma Witchel,
now a Pitt associate professor of
pediatrics. “It was demanding,
but it was excellent.”

Knobil left Pitt in 1981 to
join the University of Texas-
Houston Medical School at
Texas Medical Center. He was
medical dean there through
1984.

In 1989, Knobil was awarded

Pitt’s Dickson Prize in Medicine '
_for his research on the neurobi-

ology of the menstrual cycle in
primates. He was a member of
the National Academy of Sci-
ences and the American Acad-
emy of Arts and Sciences, and
received honorary degrees from
the University of Bordeaux, the
Medical College of Wisconsin
and the University of Milan.

Academic
physicians
should be all 3:
teachers, ’
clinicians,
researchers

To the editor: «

I mayhave lied to my 6-year— ,

old daughter. At bedtime the
other night, she asked, “DaddyI
don’t know if I want to be a
doctor, a teacher or a mother.
Can I be all three?” I replied
with a deﬁnite “yes” citing a num-
ber of colleagues, including sev-
eral of her playmates’ parents,
who heal, teach and do outstand-
-ing research in their profession.

But, I may have to retract
that based on the April 13 issue
of the University Times. You
quote Jeffrey Romoff as saying,
“It is no longer feasible to do
what academic physicians always
thought and hoped that they
could do, which is to be a good

teacher, a good researcher and a ,

good clinician.iIt’s not only not
feasible. It’s actually bad.”

Dr. Romoff asserts that in
surgery I,would want “the guy
who’s doing this [operation] ﬁve
daysa week [to the exclusion of
research a_nd teaching] , who lives
and breathes the procedure
you’re going through.” Well
maybe, if that is what makes him
a better doctor.

But I also want him to be sure
this is the best procedure for me

and his is the best technique avail-

UPMC Health Plan is encour-
aging. He said the unionis not
necessarily committed to sub-
scribe to the UPMC Health Plan,
but that was the likely choice. “I
think it’s helpful to us to know
that the University would pick
up increases in the health insur-
ance premiums over the next
three years. Our [expired] con-
tract said that we had to pick up
35 percent of any increases.”
As a new tactic, the union
plans to lobby state legislators
who sit on the House and Senate
appropriations committees,
Salmon said. “We’re hoping to
get some support to make Pitt
earmark a certain part of their
state appropriations to health
care for workers each year.” He

said union members would ap-

peal to legislators in person.
_ ‘Salmon acknowledged that it
was probably too late inthe cur-
rent budget cycle to influence
the 2001 ﬁscal year budget pro-
cess, but said contract language
could be negotiated to ensure
future legislative action would
not be precluded by the con-
tract. _
“The overall goal is to get
Pitt to take care-of its workers.
We think we have some sympa-
thy for that goal in the state leg-
islature,” he said.

Asked to comment on the
union’s plan, Pitt spokesperson
Ron Cichowicz said, “We prefer
not to speculate on what the
union may do. We are actively
involved in the negotiating pro-
cess right now on current con-
tract issues, and hope to move
toward resolution.”

Also at issue for the union,
Salmon said, is the »Univer.sity’__s..
alleged slow compliance with a
December 1999 arbitration rul-

was

- "able. Furthermore, if he is in-

deed the ‘best guy for the job’
today, but if I need the proce-
dure ﬁve years from now and he
is unavailable, I want to be sure
that he has transferred his skill to
other competent physicians.

‘In fact, 20 years from now, I
want that doctor —— not the lab
guy who neverioperates in the
clinic because he was pegged as a
“researcher,” nor his colleague
who was only a “teacher” — to
have the freedom and the incen-
tive to instrucf my daughter so
that she can be the best person
for the job. .

. Perhaps giving our physician
more time to earn tenure IS a
stepin the right direction. Per-
haps the medical system needs
to offer physicians more creative
scheduling involving three-year

rotations of research, teaching .

and clinic priorities. To be true
to our mission, we must pursue
ways to help willing physicians

ing that ordered Pitt to pay back -

wages to certain employees who

had been asked to do work out— .

side of their designated work
groups. (See University Times,
Jan. 6, 2000.)

The union‘ ﬁled an unfair la-
bor practices complaint Feb. 15
with the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board (PLRB) alleg-
ing that Pitt has not honored the
Federal Mediation and Concili-
ation Service ruling.

Last December, arbitrator
Elliot Newman directed the

University to move the duties '
that had been transferred to work -

group I cleaners back to work
group 2 groundskeepers; to
award back pay to the cleaners
who performed groundskeepers’
duties, and to pay the pool op-
erators who re—bid jobs as clean-
ers back pay at the pool opera-
tors’ rate, retroactive to Feb. 7,
1999.

To date, no action has been
taken by the PLRB.

“We’re really trying to keep
that separate from the contract
negotiations,” Salmon said.
“We’ve had verbal assurances
that the University will comply.
At some point, though, you have
to take into account the behavior
of the University and how it ap-
plies to bargaining in good faith.”

Cichowicz replied, “We have

compliedwith those two areas of

.the arbitration ruling. It took

some time to calculate how much
back wages were clue, but if the
workers‘ involved have not yet
received their pay they soon will.”
Cichowicz added that “all new
positions have been bid and ﬁlled
under the terms of the contract

and. in compliance with; the»

arbitrator’s ruling.”

to achieve our vision of ourselves

F on an individual as well as corpo-

rate level.

It seems to me a great folly
(however proﬁtable it may seem’
in the short run) to resign our-
selves to a vision of individuals
who are either researchers, teach-
ers or clinicians but not all three.
We need to accept an integrated
view of each academic physician:
that he or she be a good teacher,
researcher and clinician.

It’s not only necessary,'.iit’s
actually good. Ifwe can’t see our
way clear to believe that, let’s
just call this the “PMC Health
System” and give the “U” to a
more daring institution that can
offer a deﬁnite “yes” to our chil-
dren as they look toward their
role in the future.

Pitt statement in response to

ruling in same-sex beneﬁts case

The University of Pittsburgh is gratiﬁed that the Court of
Common Pleas, after hearing arguments from both sides and
carefully reviewingthe extensive record in this case, has pro-
hibited Deborah Henson and the other six complainants from

‘proceeding with the action against the .University pending’
before the_Pittsburgh Human Relations Commission.

Pitt respects the Human Relations Commission and the
cityordinances that prohibit discriminatory actions, and we
are pleased that this ruling in no way reduces the protections
they provide. At the same time, this ruling clearly upholds what
has been the University’s position throughout these proceed-
ings — namely that the University’s health beneﬁts plan is legal
and non-discriminatory, that the extension of beneﬁts can
lawfully be based on marital status, and that there has never
been any intentto discriminate against individuals on the basis
of sexual orientation. The ruling also states that .there is no
jurisdictional. basis for the Human Relations Commission to

For well over two hundred years, the University of Pitts-
burgh has built a reputation as an institution that cares deeply
about its people, and it remains, today, an institution that
provides an open, caring and supportive environment to liter-
ally tens of thousands of individuals. The members of the
University’s faculty and staff reflect the full spectrum of diver-
sity and possess the broadest array of human talents. Some
measure of the value we place on our faculty and staff is shown
through a generous beneﬁts package thatis fair to all. It
includes health—insurance beneﬁts to all employees, regardless

Still there are individuals who continue to attempt tomake
the availability of same—sex beneﬁts the only measure of insti-
tutional humanity. Fortunately, most people realize that there
is far more involved in establishing and maintaining an envi-
ronment of inclusion and diversity. They also recognize that
such an environment exists at Pitt and will continue to be an
important part of the University’s bright future.

He added that the November

I on which the suit was ﬁled. “The

empted by the Act, provides no
jurisdictional basis for the Com-
mission to prosecute the case
before it,” Gallo wrote.

HRC director Morrison said
the commission is studying
Gallo’s ruling in consultation
with the HRC’s solicitor. After
that, the commissioners will dis-
cuss their options.

“We’re disappointed in the
judge’s ruling,” Morrison said,
adding it was the ﬁrst time in the
commission’s history that an in-
junction had stopped an HRC
hearing. “But I don’t believe the
ruling *- undermines the

Plaintiffs vow to continue ﬁght

I laintiffs .in a lawsuit
alleging that the Uni-
versity discriminates

by denying health insurance to
its employees’ gay and lesbian
partners expressed disappoint-
ment with an Allegheny County
judge’s ruling against them.

But they said they expect that
an appealvwill be ﬁled, and they
vowed to go on with the case.

“The judge’s decision seemed
convoluted and not very well-
reasoned to me,” said Deborah
Henson, a former Pitt legal writ-
ing instructor. In 1996, Henson
ﬁled a complaint with the Pitts-
burgh Commission on Human
Relations, arguing that Pitt vio-
lated the city’s anti-discrimina-
tion law by providing inferior
employee beneﬁts to homosexu-
als;

Six current University em-
ployees have since joined Henson
in what has become a class-ac-
tion lawsuit.

On April 20, Common Pleas
Judge Robert C. Gallo issued a
preliminary injunction ordering
the Human Relations Commis-
sion to stop its investigation of
the complaint. See related story
beginning on page I.

Gallo wrote that Henson’s
complaint alleged “a discrimi-
natory violation of health insur-

'ance beneﬁts only. There is no

allegation that Pitt discriminated
against the Henson defendants
on the basis of sexual orienta-

without any legal basis,” which
he said constituted irreparable
harm.

Gallo cited Pennsylvania Util-
ity Commission 12. Israel (1947),
which deﬁned irreparable harm
as follows: “VVhen the legisla-
ture declares certain conduct to
be unlawful, it is tantamount in
law to calling it injurious to the
public. For one to continue such
conduct constitutes irreparable

. harm.”

“Therefore,” Gallo wrote,

‘ “an attempt to disregard a statu-

tory mandate would constitute
irreparable harm.”

_ Gallo also stated: “Clearly a
continuation of this investiga-
tion will cause Pitt to endure
unnecessary inconvenience and
expense. The Commission could
continue this investigation that
is emotionally charged and

ﬁercely fought. At the conclu-

sion of its investigation, the
Commission, without a remedy,
would be unable to compel Pitt
to award beneﬁts to unmarried,
same sex domestic partners, mak-
ing Pitt suffer a ‘Pyrrhic vic-
tory.’ Therefore, in order not to
prolong needless litigation,
[Pitt’s] motion for a preliminary
injunction is granted.”

Plaintiffs’ lawyer. Biancheria .

disagreed with Gallo’s ﬁndings.
“The judge is clearlywrong on
the law..He misinterpreted the
law on irreparable harm, and the
recent legislation doesn’t apply
in this case. The judge made
rulings on matters that require
presentation of evidencein a trial

before they can be ruled on. And ‘

he has usurpedthe function of
the Human Relations Commis-

tion.”

Henson, who currently prac-
tices law in New Orleans, com-
mented: “To say something as
ludicrous as, ‘the defendants
never alleged discrimination
based on sexual orientation...’
That’s what we’ve been alleging
all along! Apparently, the judge
did not read all of the pleadings
that we have submitted to the
Human Relations Commission.”

Henson continued: “In his
ruling, Judge" Gallo got into the
merits of the case, which I think
was improper because we haven’t
had a public hearing yet. That’s
what we’ve been trying to get, a
hearing at which the commis-
sion could address the merits of
our case. But Pitt has been ﬁght-
ing that.”

In November, state legisla-
tors passed a law exempting pub-
lic universities from local ordi-
nances that would force them to

provide health beneﬁts to same- -

sex couples. That state law takes
away the Pittsburgh Human
Relations Commission’s jurisdic-
tion in the Henson case, Judge
Gallo ruled. He wrote that Pitt
would suffer “immediate and ir-
reparable injury” if the case is
allowed to proceed.

Plaintiff and associate pro-
fessor of history Bruce L.
Venarde said the decision is bad
for the city “because Judge
Gallo’s ruling undermines the
authority of municipal govern-

. beneﬁts case 

sion.”

Gallo delayed ruling on a
companion case involving former
Pitt trustee Judge James J.
Flaherty, who is seeking a pre-
liminary injunction to quash a
subpoena issued by the Henson
attorneys.

Cl

In April 1996, the Human
Relations Commission ruled
there was probable cause to be-
lieve that the Universityihad dis-
criminated against Henson based
on sexual orientation.

A motion by Pitt to dismiss
the case was denied by the HRC
in June 1999 and a second mo-
tion to dismiss was denied last
December. I

Since 1993, Pitt has provided
some beneﬁts to qualiﬁed same-
sex couples, including tuition re-
mission and library privileges for
employees’ partners and bereave-
ment leave for employees.

But the University has con-
sistently based health care ben-
eﬁts eligibility on marital status
(including common law mar-
riage). Pitt says it does not dis-
criminate against gays and lesbi-
ans and is not required by law to
extend medical beneﬁts to same-
sex partners (or unmarried, op-
posite sex partners) of employ-

‘ ees. .
Plaintiffs ‘in the Henson case

have argued that Pitt’s policy
discriminates’ against them be-
cause, unlike heterosexuals, they
cannot legally marry.

In 1996, Gov.’ Tom Ridge
signed into law a bill deﬁning
marriage as a pact between a
man and a woman.

ment to enforce civil laws. The
rationale — that allowing the
complaint to. go forward is harm-

ful to Pitt —— is terrifying in -its’

implications. Are institutional
interests to outweigh due pro-
cess and access to legal remedy
against discrimination?”

Plainti ff Ray Anne Lockard,
head of the Frick Fine‘ Arts Li-
brary, said she must pay for addi-
tional health coverage for her
partner of nine years, who is too
ill to work. “When Judge Gallo
writes of his concern that con-
tinuation of the investigation in
this case will cause Pitt to endure
unnecessary inconvenience and
expense, I’m really saddened,”
Lockard said. “What about the
necessary and, in fact, life—saving
medical expenses my family has
endured for nine years because
my family is not valued?”

Lockard and fellow plaintiff
Mark S. Friedman, a staff mem-
ber in the infectious diseases and
microbiology department, said
their lawsuit is basically about
equal compensation for equal
work. ’

“My partner Raymond and I
have been together for 12 years,”
Friedman said, “and we are in a
relationship every bit as com-
mitted and respectful and dedi-
cated as any heterosexual couples
Iknow. The man or woman down
the hall who is heterosexual can
get married and get these [health]
beneﬁts. But we are not able to
get these beneﬁts because we are
unable to marry.”

PlaintiffMark A. Stein,‘ also ‘

of infectious diseases/microbi-
ology, said controversy over the
lawsuit has had a chilling effect.
“I have seen more than a few Pitt
employees in middle— or upper-
level positions become scared,
over the course of the lawsuit, to
voice their opinions or to work
to persuade Pitt to alter its deci-
sion.” _

Stein claimed that resistance
to extending health beneﬁts to
same-sex partners is led by “a
small group of narrow-minded
individuals,” including Board of
Trustees Chairperson J. Wray
Connolly.

Plaintiffs said Gallo’s ruling
disappointed but did not sur-
prise them. “I am disappointed
that this ever became a battle to
be won or lost,” Stein said. “By
simply making the ethical deci-
sion from the start, Pitt clearly

could have turned this into a

win-win situation.”

Venarde called Gallo’s deci-
sion sad news for Pitt and the
city. “Instead of lowering the
stakes and offering a possibility
for resolution, Pitt’s ‘victory’
over its employees means the
debate already roused and the
evident resentment of the
University’s legal strategies will
linger. It is hard to imagine that
such a result is good for a univer-
sityentering a major capital cam-
paign.”

V Unlike Pitt, the plaintiffs are
not amassing legal bills as the
case drags on. The ACLU is pay-
ing out—of—pocket charges for the
plaintiffs, and their ACLU law-
yers — Christine Biancheria,
James Lieber and Roslyn Litman
— are working on a pro bono
basis. I .. . L .

ears, we’ve been hearing that
the violent breakup of Yugosla-
via was the inevitable result of
ancient ethnic hatreds which un-
dermined a so—called artiﬁcial
state.

“That’s nonsense. Over the
centuries, the south Slavic eth-
nic groups spent a lot more time
building inclusive and harmoni-
ous communities than they did
slitting each others’ throats.”

Yugoslavia was no less legiti-
mate than any other multi-eth-
nic, religiously diverse nation,
Talbott said. Even if the
country’s constituent republics
-— Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia,
Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia —
insisted on going their own way
after the fall of Soviet Commu-
nism, they could have followed
the examples of Czechoslovakia
and the U.S.S.R. itself in split-

’ ting up peacefully along existing

internal boundaries, according
to Talbott. '

But Yugoslavia was cursed
with four deadly “isms,” he said:

° Facism, including occupa-
tion by German Nazis and the
divisive legacy of Croatia’s home-
grown Ustache.

° Communism. VVhile the
regime of Josip Broz Tito was
less repressive than the old So-
viet government, it did not fos-
ter mature consideration of eth-
nic grievances. “The old man
still dealt harshly with those who
challenged his authority,”
Talbott said, adding ,half-
admiringlythat Tito “was most
inclined to crack heads when the
challenge was militant, atavistic,
divisive ethnic politics.”

 .°.. .(3.ha..uv,ini.$Li.c. .n.2i.tL0na1iSrI1§. 

“But even nationalism, in and of
itself, did not necessarily doom
Yugoslavia,” Talbott said.

° The utter cynicism of
Yugoslav leaders during the post-
Tito era. “Tito’s power was such
that his death in May 1980 left a
vacuum of the kind that nature,
and particularly human nature,
abhors,” Talbott said. “This led
to a free—for—all, a jockeying for
power and privilege among local
potentates and demagogues. . ..
They preyed on their constitu-
ents’ fears and insecurities, they
played one region’s fortunes off
against others and, last but not
least, they picked at the scabs of

\ old wounds.”

Talbott visited Pitt last week
in honor of the retirement of his
friend Dennison Rusinow, re-
search professor at the Univer-
sity Center for International
Studies and adjunct professor in

- the history department. Talbott

and Rusinow met in Belgrade in
197 1, when Talbott moved there
as Time Magazine’s Eastern
European correspondent.
Rusinow was therereporting on
current affairs in Yugoslavia for

the American Universities Field _

Staff (later the Universities Field
Staff International).

Talbott said Rusinow and his
wife, Mary, took him under their
wing — advising Talbott on
Balkan politics, helping him with
his “fractured” Serbian, treating
him to Sunday morning waffles.

‘After 21 "years with Time,
‘Talbottileft journalism for a job
, in the State Departrnent. He has

been deputy secretary since Feb- _

ruary 1994.,

Early on, Rusinow divined a
rat in ’Serbia’s Slobodan
Milosevic, Talbott recalled. ’

“It was Denny who called my ‘

attention to the meteoric rise of

_ this Titoist turned businessman,

turned Serb ji-ngoist "and. popu-
list. Long be fore Milosevic was a
household word, Denny had him
pegged as a snakeoil salesman,
peddling an especially noxious
brew of national pride and para-
noia.

“At the same time, Denny’

also-cautioned that we must not
regard repressive, regressive na-
tionalism as inherently, exclu-
sively or even mainly a Serbian
condition. Rather than demon-

izing the Serbs, he helped us to‘ t

understand .how and why the
Yugoslavian experiment went
disastrously wrong and who was
to blame.” ’

From 1965 on, Rusinow
warned — through American
Universities Field Staff reports,
mediaicommentaries and other
writings —— of a potential blood-
bath in Kosovo, Talbott noted,
addingthat Rusinow condemned
extreme Albanian nationalism in
that province as well as the
Serbianbrand.

D .

To a large extent, Talbott

maintained, “Yugoslavia was al-

” lowed to die by a short—sighted,

indecisive and distracted inter-
national community, and that
includes the United States.”

Distracted during the early.

1990s with the Gulf War and the
U.S.S.R.’s collapse, the West-
ern democracies failedfto see the
dangers of a Yugoslav meltdown,

,Talbott said. _“We should have

marshaled ourleverage-, which
was considerable, if not to keep
the old Yugoslavia intact, then at

iléast ..t‘9 irzsfsases the ishance that
its breakup" might occur peace-

fully,,,_  if ,

“Ifthe center of a post-Com-
muniststate cannot hold, better
it should come apart by mutual
agreement that converts old in-
ter—republic boundaries into new
international ones. That’s what
happened with the Czechoslo-
vak ‘velvet divorce’ and with the
dissolution of the Soviet Union.”

VVhen Slovenia and Croatia
first made clear their determina-
tion to gain independence, the
West should have withheld rec-
ognition and support until those
states ensured protection of mi-
nority rights and respect for new
national_ borders, Talbott said.
“But instead of setting condi-
tions, wesaid ‘yes’ first and asked
questions later. And we’re still
answering those questions to-
day.” i _ , . _

Cl

During the question-and-an-'
swer session following Talbott’s
lecture, Pitt’ political science pro-
fessor Jonathan Harris took is-
sue with Talbott’s equation of
the breakups of Czechoslovakia
(where Czechs and Slovaks were
concentrated in,separate regions)

’ and Yugoslavia (where, ethnic

groups intermingled throughout
the country). _ —

Talbott agreed that carving
new.nations out of Yugoslavia

‘ was more complicated than in

‘ “In our plate vault, there are
about 500,000 exposures of the

achieved,” Gatewood said. “Only
about one-third of those plates

Evidence of heretofore un-
known planets could be among
those plates, Gatewood said.

By its gravitational pull, a
planet orbiting a star will cause
that star to “wobble” slightly in
its own orbit. By scientifically
measuring microscopic wobbles
in the movements of distant stars
over years, astronomers can de-
tect new planets. That’s how the
two Ursa Major planets were
found, Gatewood pointed out.

usingforce that Milosevic and
‘ his forces finally agreed to with- _

draw from Kosovo,'let the [1.4
million Albanian] refugees come

back, and let the international

community come in._”
I Talbott said diplomatic ef-
forts to resolve the crisis elicited

only “cynicism, tactical wile and

stubbornness” from Milosevic.
“He was determined to complete

’ what he had begun 10 years be-

fore and particularly at the be-
ginning of last year, and that was

‘ a campaign of ethnic cleansing

and the utter suppression of the
Albanian majority in Kosovo.
“I can tell you, having worked
very closely with both our politi-
cal leadership and our military

~ leadership, that every effort was
’ made to minimize the harm and

damage to innocent civilians.
Nonetheless, there was damage,
and people were killed. But our
attitude, our intentions, our prac-
tices during the conduct of that
military operation were exactly
the opposite of Milosevic’s. His
purpose was to maximize the
damage and pain and suffering

Talbott said.

“It’s an open question,
whether the people who live
there are ever going to grow com-
fortable with the notion of some
sort of self-governing autonomy
short of total independence. The
answer is going to depend in
Large measure on how much
longer Serbia itself will be under
the sway of the tyranny and bar-
barism personified - by
Milosevic.”

D

In brief concluding com-
ments, Rusinow said: “I suppose
I must thank Strobe Talbott for
embarrassing me with personal
remarks that, believe me, grossly
exaggerate my really very mod-
est contributions to this place,
my discipline or disciplines, and
certainly to [Talbott’s] under-
standing of the area” of the Bal-
kans.

“I’m sure he was dishing out

‘at numberof things as my

today.” _

ulty in September 1988. He re-

ported on current affairs in east-
central and Balkan Europe for

casions 'and asked them for

“In our nextround of pro-
posals, we plan to go star-by-

and from that data we can deter-
mine the following things. . ..’”

Allegheny also hopes to in-
corporate data it’s collected over
the last 85 years with new NASA
information in the search for new
planets. “One of the drawbacks
of satellite—based telescope
projects is that they usually only
fly for about five years,”
Gatewood said. “That isn’t long
enough to detect ‘wobbles’ in
very slow orbits. But if you‘ com-
bined the data from our plates
with the data that will come from
the FAME project, it would give
us something like 90 years’ worth
of observations.” -

In addition to analyzing data
from space telescopes, Allegh-
eny Observatory hopes to con-
tinue training scientists to use

astronomical equipment, and to’

become a site where new equip-
ment is developed for use in
space, Gatewood said. - '
“We also will continue as a
tour facility for the people of
Pittsburgh, which was one of the

observatory’s~ main pu-«rposesn

when it was built,” he said.

As for Allegheny’s showpiece,
the Thaw refractor (with its 14-
year-old lenses and instrumen-
tation, added to the original 87-
year-old telescope tube. and

mount), Gatewood said: “I would
foresee that it will be used in
conjunction’ with the ‘satellite

telescopes and our computer
analysis work for at least the next
decade. Beyondthat, it’s difﬁ—
cult to say.” ' '

Gatewood said the 47-foot-
long telescope is unique: a large
refractor that works in the red
part of the light spectrum. “That
means it works well in a city
environment,” he explained.
“VVhen you look,at the red part
of the spectrum, the sky over
Pittsburgh is quite dark. -It’s al-

most like being out in the coun-

pollution in the valley below

will promote medical entrepre-
neurial knowledge and activities
among UPCI faculty and stu-

source support Initial funding
for the center has been provided
by a grant from Scott Limbach.

Educational activities of the
Limbach Center will include a
lecture series featuring success-
ful medical entrepreneurs, semi-
nars on business issues related to
entrepreneurship and a possible
degree program on medical en-
trepreneurship.

Ronald B. Herberman, UPCI
director, said, “The Limbach

Center will be a valuable asset in
assisting our faculty and re-
searchers in becoming more in-
volved in taking important ideas
from the laboratory to the mar-
ketplace. After the center begins
to achieve this goal related to
cancer research, we envision that
it will be broadened to encom-
pass a much wider range of op-
portunities across the Schools of
the Health Sciences at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.” L
Herberman said that UPCI
faculty have been successful in
innovative research and in ob-
taining more than $90 million
annually in federal and other
funding. “The Limbach Center
offers a very novel way to build
on that strong foundation and
spawn substantial growth in re-

over time. Even moving targets
like oil spills can be mapped us-
ing remote sensing data. '

‘ Closer to home, GIS images
are being used more and more
by Pitt’s Facilities Management
team for compiling physical plant
data. “You can measure how
many buildings are within a des-
ignated distance with pinpoint
accuracy,” said Nicholas Contis,

. systems supervisor. He said that

mosaics of fly-over images pro-
vide design blueprints for the
entire campus infrastructure. “It

» has University—wide application

and helps us do our job. You can
cut part of the image out of the
campus, superimpose it at the
exact latitude and longitude on a
fly—over image and study sewer
lines, electric, lines, water lines
and other physical plant sys-

, terns. ”

Some of the information

-would help with maintenance

and repair decisions, he said.

-_ “«Sa~y,'=you»-find water leaks; and;

through these maps you recog-

. nize a trend that the leaks are all.

in a-particular area. You may
decide the appropriate action is
to replace the large water main
in that area, instead of dealing
with the-problem leak by leak.”
, GIS began in 1990 when the
United States Geologic Survey,
the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Natural _Re-
source Conservation Service and
Farm Service Agency proposed
a national program to ensure the

public domain availability of digi- .

tal orthophoto quadrangle
(DOQ) data.
DOQS are aerial photographs

in digital form in which displace-

.ments caused by camera orienta-

tion and terrain have been re-
moved. These products combine
the image characteristics of a
photograph with the geometric
quality ofa map and canbe used
in numerous GIS ‘applications
either alone or in combination
with other digital data, such as
digital line graphs or digital to-
pographic maps called raster

‘ graphics. .

Harbert recently provided a
series of Pittsburgh fly—over digi-
tal images to the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Natural History’s new
Earth Theater, which produced

_'a 20-minute piece called “The

Millennium Show.” The show
whisks the audience through
some of the major events of the
geological history of the Earth,
including the birth of the moon,
the Ice Age, the Age of Dino-
saurs and the formation of the
continents and oceans. I
,- Part of the show includes a
Pittsburgh ﬂy—over that was pre-

pared by Pitt’s GPS department. .

According to Kerry Handron,
director of the Earth Theater,
“Bill Harbert gave these images
to us as a way to bring us up to

‘ the present. Data tells us that all

the rivers in this area used to run
north. Now we get a contempo-
rary, accurate look at the_Three

Rivers. Bill read the script I had .

written and matched the images
to fit,” Handron said.
The Earth Theater’s Millen-

nium Show is viewed at a210-

degree radius around the audi- ~

ence, with a 40-foot diameter

» screen viewed at audience level.
‘More. than. .1 .1',;O0.0._. :p.e‘opl‘e"_have

seen the show since the theater
opened~.i-n’December, Handron
said. i
“No tapes, no slides, no film,”
she said. “Only digitized images
from a very large hard—drive.”
Handron says the images run at
a speed of 30 per second.
Faster than the ol’ time clock,
anyway. '

Pittsburgh and nationwide. Root
is the 1 1th recipient of the award
in the society’s 26-year history.

“Under Root’s tutelage,” said
a society spokesperson, “the
University of Pittsburgh has
come to be at the epicenter of
activity in American music,” and
has prompted the society to re-

locate its offices to Pitt.
In 1996, Root ‘helped estab-
lish Pitt’s..Center for American

Airbags, seat belts
prevent spinal injuries

Airbags along with seat belt

use decrease spinal injuries in
automobile crashes, reported‘

William F. Donaldson III and
his orthopaedic research team

-from UPMC Health System.

Researchers analyzed medi-
calrecords of 7, 1 70 patients who
suffered spinalinjuries in auto-
mobile crash injuries. Patients
were divided into four groups
based upon protection devices
used — no protective devices
(4,636 patients); seat belts only
(2,268 patients); air bags only
(110 patients); and seat belts and
air bags(138 patients). I

When compared to individu- ‘

als using air bags: and seat belts
who were involved in crashes,
the researchers found patients
using no protective devices were
37 percent more likely to suffer a

‘ spinal injury; those using seat

belts only were 42 percent more
likely; and those protected by an
airbag onlywere 3 5 percent more
likely to suffer spinal injury.
“Not wearing a seat belt or
gettinginto a'car without air
bags greatlyincreases the chance
of having a spinal injury,”- said
Donaldson, who is associate pro-
fessor and chief of orthopaedic
spinal surgery in UPMC’s de-

‘ partment of orthopaedic surgery.

He noted that older persons were

more likely to wear a’ seat belt’
and drive an .automobile with

airbags’.

This 1'0-year, multi-center study, ~

funded by the National Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH), was pre-
sented by Molly Vogt, associate
professor of orthopaedic surgery
and epidemiology. — - '
Wrist fractures often are in-

dicators of osteoporotic bone, .

according to Vogt.

A total of 9,704 women aged
65 years and older were enrolled
in the study. They completed
questionnaires about their.age;

smoking history; exercise activi-
ties; functional impairments; his-

tory of selected medical condi-

tions such as diabetes, arthritis
and fractures; and family history
of fractures.

Ofthe 9,704women, 527 had
sustained a wrist fracture during
the 10-year period. The women’s
average age at the time of the
fracture was 76 years. 5

Researchers reported that key
indicators for wrist fractures in
women include low bone min-
eral density, recurrent falling,
prior fractures and no current
use of estrogen. “We now can
identify those individuals at in-
creased risk and be able to in-
struct them about preventive
measures earlyin life,” Vogt said.

Simple insulin
resistance test
predicts heart-
disease in type
1 diabetics

A simple series of questions
and measurements to determine
insulin sensitivity could help save
the lives of many people with
type 1 diabetes by identifying

7 those who are at an increased

risk of heart disease. ,

The new test is described by
researchers from Pitt’s Gradu-
ate School of Public Health and
School of Medicine in a paper
published in the April issue of
Diabetes, a journal ofthe Ameri-
can Diabetes Association.

I Dubbed the Insulin Resis-
tance Syndrome (IRS) s_core, the
test is a clinical_ means of rhea-
suring insulin resistance, a con-
dition that researchersbelieve
may be common, butoften over-
looked, in patients with type 1

- ’ ‘di‘éibete§.'.I,n.t1fefp;ist,. ;in.s.u1.i.n re-

with typ_e‘2_ diabetes.

In  1 diabetes, which af-
fects l0 to 15 percent of all'dia—
betics, the pancreascannot make
insulin to regulate, blood glu-
cose. The condition often devel-
ops in patients before the age of
30 and requires insulin therapy.

Insulin resistance occurs
when the body does not prop-
erly use insulin to metabolize
blood sugar. To compensate, the
body produces_more insulin, re-

weight; height at 25 years old; I-sulting mean oversupply"

Insulin resistance is associ-
ated with an increased risk of

coronary artery disease, a lead-

ing cause of death in people with
typeil diabetes. With the new
IRS score, physicians can iden-
tify irisulin resistant patients and
begin heart—saving treatment
including exercise, weight loss

a and medication. .
“Insulin. resistance has long

been recognized in type 1 diabe-
tes, but few studies have exam-
ined the association between
clinical IRS risk factors and in-
sulin resistance in this popula-
tion,”said Trevor J. Orchard,

_ professor of epidemiology at
' GSPH and senior author of the

article. «

This study is the first to de- 51

velop a method of estimating a

'patient’s insulin sensitivity and

validating it with the use of the
insulin clamp, a three—hour test
during which glucose and insu-_
lin are ad-ministered intrave-

I nously and adjusted to achieve
stable blood glucose levels. The I

clamp measures an individual’s
glucose disposal rate (GDR). A
low GDR shows that the body is
not using insulin effectively ‘to
process glucose, indicating insu-

lin resistance.
. “Up until now, the clamp has

i been the most accurate means of

determining insulin resistance,
but itpis used only in research
because it is expensive and time

consuming,” said study clinical"

investigator Katherine V. Wil-
liams, of Pitt’s division of endo-
crinology and metabolism. “But
our research study has shown
that the IRS score is a good proxy
measure, and the beauty is that it
is not costly, intimidating, inva-
sive or time consuming.”

The IRS score is based on
clinical risk factors in adults with
type 1 diabetes, including hy-
pertension, high waist—to-hip
ratio, family history of type 2
diabetes and glycemic control.

Th_e study was funded by the
National Institutes of Health and
UPMC Health System’s Gen-
eral Clinical Research Center.

logic and host factors involved in
HIV transmission in women.”
According to Gupta, the new

, model will help researchers de-

velop and test creams, supposi-
tories or other medications to

block the transmission of HIV. ’

Models to date have demon-
strated HIV transmission across
a single layer of human cells
grown speciﬁcally for that pur-
pose. The new Pittsburgh model
uses actual human tissue and thus
closely mimics the stratiﬁed cell
layers that are present at the sites
of sexual transmission in women.

Estrogen may
fuel lung
cancer grolnrth
Estrogen, long known for its.
role in fueling the growth of
breast cancer, may spur the same

, process in lung cancer, accord-

ing to_Pitt research ﬁndings pre-
sented this monthat the annual

_ meetingof the American Asso-V -
_. ciation for Cancer —'Research.,’

The results are the ﬁr_st_to

iiidirectly demonstrate increased
‘growth of .non—small cell lung
, cancer in the presen.ce.of estro- .

. gen.

“In our studies, we found
greater numbers of estrogen re-

ceptors on lung cancer cells than
on normal lungcells, strongly
suggesting a role for this hor-
mone in enhancing tumor
growth,” said]ill Siegfried, prin-
cipal investigator of the study
and vice chairperson of Pitt’s
pharmacology department.
Annually, lung cancer kills
about 60,000 women in the
United States, makingit the lead-
ing cancer killer of women. Non-
small cell lung cancer comprises

. 80 percent of lung cancer cases.

Some population studies have
suggested that women develop
the disease at an earlier age and
with less reported tobacco expo-
sure than men, prompting sci-
entists to search for biological
reasons that could account for
these discrepancies. Investiga-
tions by Siegfried and others have
indicated that lung cancer is dif-
ferent in women than in men,
both with regard to the type of
tumors that develop and the
molecular mechanisms underly-
ing the disease.

“Women have a naturally
higher circulating estrogen level
than men, and this difference
may contribute to their increased
susceptibility to lung cancer,”
Siegfried said. “As in breast can-

t. cer, blocking the effects of estro-

gen could prove an important
therapeutic strategy to halt dis-
ease progression or prevent re-
currence. In addition; blocking
estrogen receptors could prove
beneﬁcialinpreventinglungcan-
cer in women at high risk, much
like blocking estrogen’s effect

has been shown to prevent breast “ 

cancer in women at increased
risk for that disease.”

Siegfried’s research on estro-

gen is supported by the Univer-
sity" of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute’s Lung Cancer Program
and the National. Cancer Insti-
tute.

B pass more

e ective than
angioplasty in
protecting
diabetics from
heart .attack,
study finds

Diabetic patients on medica-
tion who have had coronary by-
pass surgery are more likely to
survive a heart attack than are
diabetics who have had
angioplasty, announced re-
searchers from Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health (GSPH)
in the April 6 issue of The New
England Journal of Medicine.

“Bypass surgery provides a
protective effect that accounts
for the dramatic difference we
found in the overall death rates
of diabetic patients who under-
went one of these two
revascularization procedures,”
said Katherine Detre, director
of the Epidemiology Data,Cen—
ter at GSPH and a principal in-
vestigator of the study.

This ﬁnding is a result of the
Bypass Angioplasty Revascu-
larization Investigation (BARI),
an international, Emulti-center
randomized study coordinated
by GSPH and funded by the
National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute. The study compared

"coronar arte b ass raftsur—
Y FY VP 3

gery with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angio-

plasty in patients with multivessel
coronary artery disease who had
not previously received either
procedure but who were medi-
cally qualiﬁed for both.

BARI researchers found that
mortality at ﬁve years was 8 per-
cent for the 2,962 patients with-
out diabetes and 20 percent for
the 641 patients with diabetes.
Mortality rates were 7 percent
for non—diabetics and 18 percent
for diabetics among those pa-
tients who underwent bypass
surgery, and 8 percent and 25
percent, respectively, for those
who had angioplasty.

However, among diabetic
patients who had heart’ attacks
subsequent_to the start of the
study, mortality at ﬁve years af-

ter the heart attack was 17 per-

cent for those who had under-
gone bypass surgery (similar to
the rate for non—diabetics), as
compared with 80 percent among
those who had undergone
angioplasty.

Both types of coronary

' revascularization resulted in an

immediate increase in the

0 amount of heart muscle receiv-

ing blood flow. Butinvestigators
noted that after one year, the
vessels of patients who had un-
dergone bypass surgery re-
mained open to a greater degree,
thus protecting them from the
potentially fatal damage brought
on by a heart attack.

An estimated 14 million
people in the United States have
diabetes. Diabetics are two to
four times more likely to have
heart disease than are non—dia-
betics, researchers say.

Nlenstrual
cycle may
affect success
of women who
are trying to
quit smoking

Research shows that timing
is everything for women trying
to quit smoking.

In research published in a
recent issue of the Journal of
Consulting and Clinical Psychol-
ogy, psychiatry professor Ken-
neth A. Perkins found that

women who quit smoking dur-

ing the follicular phase of the
menstrual cycle (1-14 days fol-
lowing menstruation) experi-
enced less severe symptoms of
tobacco withdrawal and depres-
sion than women who quit dur-
ing the luteal phase (day 15 or
longer post—menstrual).
According to Perkins, the dif-
ferences in symptoms could be

due to the menstrual cycle’s hor- ’

monal changes and their influ-
ence on mood. Negative mood
due to cycle phase combined with
tobacco withdrawal could make
sustained quitting very difﬁcult.

“One implication of these
results is that younger women
preparing to quit smoking should
select a quit day early in their
menstrual cycle_ to minimize

‘withdrawal symptoms and de-
pression,” Perkins said. “This

simple behavioral strategy for
timing the quit day may decrease
negative mood effects of cessa-
tion.”

Further study of hormonal
influences and sex differences in
factors affecting smoking behav-
ior may lead to improved treat-
ment of smoking cessation in
women, Perkins said. I

SUMMARY:

In 1918, Albert Einstein said his equations of general relativity possess so-
lutions for describing wavelike undulations of the gravitational field. These
gravitational waves are actually ripples in the fabric of space and time that
travel to Earth, bringing with them information about their violent origins
and about the nature of gravity. Now, for the first time, experiments using
new detectors with enough sensitivity to detect gravitational waves are
poised to test Einstein’s long-standing predictions. With such detectors,
scientists promise to open a_n entirely new window on the universe, where
we can “listen”,for the sounds of gravitational waves from distant cosmos. _

ABOUT BARRY BARISH:

Internationally regarded as a leader in the ﬁeld of elementary particle phys-
ics, Barry Barish- is the Maxine and Ronald Linde Professor of Physics at the
California Institute of Technology and the director of the Laser Interferom-
eter Gravitationa/-Wave Observatory (LIGO). At LIGO, he has led a team of
scientists and engineers from Caltech and MIT in the construction ‘of two
large facilities that will be used in coincidence for the detection and study of
gravitational waves from astrophysical sources. A 

This lecture is funded under the auspices of the Buhl Professorship in Theoretical Physics. which was established at
Carnegie Mellon in 1961 by The Buhl Foundation in support of an outstanding theoretical scientist who would both
impact theoretical researcli and help establish directions for experimental investigations.
