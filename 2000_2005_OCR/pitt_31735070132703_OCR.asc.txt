VOLUME XCVHI, NUMBER 134

Rap, ‘ 80s rock and traditional dance collide

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Staff Writer

Brittany Taylor stands at the
back Of the stage, microphone in
hand.

She epitomizes the style of the
‘80s, from top to bottom. Her
crimped hair and blue eye shadow
emphasize the statement made by
her bright-lim —green shirt, leopard-
print belt and purple, knee-length
skirt.

It’s clear from the hushed whis-
pers and darting eyes that the audi-
ence at the second armual
Multicultural Talent Show on
Thursday night doesn’t know what
to make of her.

But as the ﬁrst chords of
Madonna’s “Like a Prayer’ ’ play in
the background, excitement surges

- She struts to the front of the
stage, singing the lyrics to the song
and swaying her hips provocatively.
But almost as soon as it has begun,
the music changes to the slower and
sultrier “Black Velvet,” by Alannah
Myles. ' '

“Black velvet and that little
boy’s smile, black velvet with that
slow, Southern style,” Taylor sings,
slowly running her hand up her hips
and waist and through her hair.

The music stops. Silence. '

“Uh, oh,” she says, grabbing her
ﬁshnet-stocking-clad leg with her
right hand and holding it away from
her body.

The next song — this one with
a rhythmic rock beat — comes on as
she brings her left hand down and
strurns her leg as ifit were a guitar.

“Hit me with your best shot!”

Groups gather to celebrate Abu—Jamal’s new book

DANTE RENZULLI
Staff Writer

The event started in the early evening on Saturday and
went late into the night Loud music and chanting ﬁlled the
room, where some people wore beads. This was not how-
ever, a South Oakland party — the atmosphere was much
more serious. ~ -

Supporters of Murnia Abu-Jamal gathered in Alurrmi

  Hall to celebrate his new book, “Faith of our Fathers: An

Examination of the Spiritual Life of Africans and African-
Americans.” As described by the Aﬁican World Press, the
book is a moving portrayal of black faith, spanning 500

- years of history. This is one of the several pieces that Abu-
‘Jamal has written while serving time on deaﬂr row.

Controversy has grown concerning Abu-Jamal’s con-
viction for the 1981 shooting death of a Philadelphia police
ofﬁcer. A number of organizations have taken up his ﬁght
and hold demonstrations on his behalf.

Some of the ’ speakers at the celebration included
Founder of the Aza nia Heritage Mongezi wa’Nkomo, and
Renee Wilson, ﬁom People Against Police Violence.

Moderator Kenny Henderson summed up the move-
ment by saying, “Because of what we’ve gone through for
several centuries, it is up to us to refuse and resist.”

The Pat Benatar song proves

Talent, page 4

In addition to promoting Abu-Ja1nal’s latest work,

speakers at the book celebration praised Abu-Jarnal’s life

and said prayers for his cause. The night began with a pour-
ing of libations, in which oil or wine is poured out as a sac-
riﬁce to God in honor of a dead person. .While the libations
were being poured, the moderator asked members of the
audience to call out the names of the ancestors and “fallen
warriors” whom they thought would be supportive of
group’s interest Some of these names included Booker T‘.
Washington, Haniet Tubman and Ramses II.

Songs were also performed in tribute to “Brother
Mumia” by the band, Despite Our Best Intentions.

Since being sentenced to death in 1983, Abu-Jamal has
received international support to overturn his conviction. At
the time of his arrest, he was serving as the president of the
Association of Black Journalists and was a founder of the
Philadelphia Black Panther Party. ’

‘, Mumia Abu-Jamal testiﬁed that on the night of Dec. 9,
1981, he was driving through the red-light district of down-
town Philadelphia and heard gunshots. According to his tes-
timony, shortly after hearing the shots, Abu-Jamal saw his

‘brother, William Cook, stumbling in the street, With a gun in

his hand, Abu-Jarnal ran to his brother’s side and was shot
by Police Oﬂicer Daniel Faulkner, Abu-Jamal said. When
police arrived on the scene, both Murnia Abu-Jarnal and

 and Preeti perform in Thursday ni t’s
which included a variety of talents and inﬂuences.

 

Faulkner had been shot, and Faulkner later died Abu-Jamal
said that he fell unconscious and did not ﬁre his gun

According to a Dec. .18, 2001, story from theAssociated A

Press, Abu—Jamal was accused of shooting Faulkner in the

back and face when he saw the officer struggling with Cook

Although police found a gun-, registered to Abu—Jamal, with
ﬁve spent shell casings at the scene of the shooting, the
defense argued that his gun could not be positively identiﬁed
as having ﬁred the bullet that killed.Faulkner.

In 1999, Amold Beverly confessed to killing the police
officer. Later, the confession was supported by a lie detector
test, the event organizers said, but the Supreme Court reject-
ed the appeal and did not allow the evidence to be present-
ed.

According to the same Associated Press report, Beverly
said in his afﬁdavit confession that the mob hired him to kill
Faulkner after the ofﬁcer had interfered in the mob’s deal-
ings. Beverly’s confession was not deemed credible by Abu-
Jamal’s former lawyers, and the presiding judge refused to
order Beverly to testify, the story reported. I

Murnia Abu-Jarnal will remain on death row until all of
the appeals have concluded. .

The International Concerned Family & Friends

iMumia Abu-Jamal will hold a march and rally in

Philadelphia on April 24th for his 50th birthday.

Volkan examines regression,other results of trauma

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
__.,m__ A V Staff Writer

Dr. Varnik Volkan was in a Tunisian orphanage when he
first  ,cqg;d become a suicide
bonﬁen ..;:;;3,f;£§.?;,;;j'

It 171991‘-,‘@‘ttl-“th'e  a converted women’s
hospital lmown asthe,Home of Steadfastness, located in the
arid  there, he observed a
particular group of ﬁve orphans. He noticed that when they
played together, theirbehaviior  not unlike children play-
ing elsewhere. ' . I ‘

But when he separated and interviewed them individu-
ally, these same children became violently agitated, and even
had hallucinations. .

On March 27, Volkan visited Pittsburgh to give a lec-

I ture, “Societal Regression and Violence: Beyond September

11th,” sponsored by the Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic
Foundation, at the Rodef Shalom Synagogue.

As he told an audience in October 2001, while lecturing
on the same topic, ‘This is when I began to understand how,
in some people, individual identity is replaced with large
group identity,” he said of the ﬁve children. “When together,

normal. Separately, they were not.”

According to Volkan, this phenomenon results from the
way people around the world deal with trauma  on
them by others.

The parents of these ﬁve children had been killed during
a 1982 massacre in refugee camps in Lebanon, where they
had grown up. Because these displaced children were too
young to remember their parents or identities, they were all
given the surname Arafat, after the leader of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, which ran the orphanage.

“This was not a jihad factory where they raised the kids

to be suicide bombers,” Volkan said

Instead, it was a place where these particular individuals
had come together to form a new, extreme group identity to
help them deal withpast shame, humiliation or helplessness.
In these ﬁve children, Volkan found a microcosm for the
emotional condition of people around the world who join
groups for which they become willing to kill themselves and
many others. . -

This psychoanalytical description of suicide bomber
evolution may have been difﬁcult for some in the audience
in October 2001, because Volkan was giving this particular
lecture in New York City, only a month after the attacks ﬂrat
destroyed the World Trade Center.

But confronting massive shared traumas, like the events
of Sept. 11, 2001, and studying how diﬂerent groups and
societies deal with them is something Volkan has been doing
for decades. ' —

After a childhood spent growing up on the eastern
Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where Cypriot Greeks and

Turks violently split the nation down political and ethnic

lines, he grew up to serve as a consultant on a number of
United Nations commissions to areas ‘ umatized” by vio-
lence, such as Israel, Kosovo, Cold War-era Berlin and the
former Soviet Union.

As a professor of psychiatry and founder of the Center
for the Study of Mind and Human Interaction at the
University ofV1rgir1ia, Volkan has tried to explore the issues
associated with group trauma in several of his published
writings, including his most recent book, “Blind Trust: Large
Groups and Their Leaders in TIIIICS of Crisis and Tenor.”

As he told ﬂie audience in New York, regression occurs
when “you go back to utilizing mechanisms ﬂrat were avail-
able to you as a child, and they protect you from plunging
into fear.”

In a 2001 article he authored for the center he founded,
titled “September 11 and Societal Regression,” Volkan gave
the example of a woman he knew, who had been so upset by
the attacks in New York that she had “regressed” to eating
only macaroni and cheese — something her mother had
made for her as a child ——-I for weeks afterward.

In the same article, he asserted that strong leadership in .

the wake of nationally traumatic, events is essential to how a
society deals with widespread regressive behavior, including
acts more violent than ‘eating macaroni.

' When the popularity polls of President George W. Bush
dramatically increased in the wake of the attacks, Volkan
wrote that this was evidence that Americans were dealing
with their own anxieties and fears by “rallying around” a
strong symbolic ﬁgure of power, reminiscent of a comfort-
ing parent

Leaders in these turbulent periods, according to Volkan, I

have the ability to shape the emotional direction a population
will takeby using tactics like exploiting a “chosen” past
traumatic event, where a large group of people have been
made to all feel ‘shame, humiliation or helplessness, for a
variety of psychological purposes. .

He pointed to the tactic of comparing the recenttrauma

of attacks on the World Trade Center to the‘ “chosen” trauma
of the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor in .1941 as a way to '

help Americans make sense of the situation.
Alternatively, he also gave the negative example of for-

mer Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic using the ancient ‘ '

cultural humiliation of ﬂre Serb defeat by Ottoman Turks in

’ 1389, at the Battle of Kosovo, as a regressive tactic for inspir- '

ing violence against Bosnian Muslims more than 600 years
later.

gospel group, a violin player, rap acts, a ﬁve-
piece band and a spoken—word performance.

After Taylor, dancers listed only as
Kadita and Preeti took the stage in ﬂowing
ﬂoor—length gowns and began performing an
Indian-style dance.

At ﬁrst, the song was slow and sensual,
and the dancers moved accordingly, their
anns and legs making wide, sweeping ges-
tures. But asthe beat quickened, so did their
movements. '

They began to kick and twirl in unison
with the music before coming to a halt, and
the audience responded with enthusiastic
claps.

Later in the night, Nathan James
switched gears by performing a spoken-
word act, titled “Reparations.”

‘ He talked about the gifts he would buy
his girlfriend and the hubcaps he would get
for his new car. 4

‘‘So, basically, when I get me my repa- -

rations from the govemment,” he ﬁnished,
“I’m gonna give it all right back,” ‘ V, .

Several acts later, Joy Ike, « sister of
Peace Ike, who‘ had sung earlier, played the
piano and sang a song that she wrote.

As her ﬁngers glided over the -piano
keys, she crooned, “I am longing for love to
open ﬂie door to my heart”

“Come to me, all you are, andI will give
you all I  she promised.

As Ike left ﬂue stage, Myke Reiser, a_k.a.
Big Myke, took the stage in blue jeans, a
black T-shirt and a black beanie cap pulled
low over his forehead

Big Myke introduced himself, telling
the audience he would perform a rap ﬂiat he
wrote called “White Lightning.”

“It’s white lightning. I got you fright-
ened Sippin’ your food through "a straw,
takin’ V1codin,” he started, causing the
whole audience to break out in laughter.

Pretty soon,,the crowd began to chant,
“Yo, yo, yo,” as someone from the audience
asked, “Is someone taping this?”

After Big Myke ﬁnished his rap, he was
greeted with the second standing ovation of
the night

9 The night ﬁnished with a performance
by the dance group Yeah.

The three women of the group lay prone
on the stage in a line, each one halfway on
top of the next. The audience —— and the only
male judge — stood up to better see ﬂie
women. Slow, sensual music began to play,
and two men emerged from the sides of the
stage. They stood over the women, who
were gyrating their hips in time with the
music, and begin to undress, loosening their
ties and unbuttoning their shirts.

The audience went wild.

Women started screaming, and one man
held his cell phone high above the crowd to
take a picture. .

As the men unbuttoned their White
shirts, they revealed form-ﬁtting, black tank
tops. By this time, the women had risen,
allowing the audience to sit back down, and
were thrusting their hips forward

But the music changed from slow and
sensual to fast and titillating. The move-
ments becarne faster and even sexier, the
thrusts more urgent. ' _

But once again, the music changed, this
time to Usher’s “Yeah.”

The men" emerged from the wings,
doing back ﬂips across the stage. The danc-
ing became almost convulsive, anns and
legs shaking and lashing out before ﬁnally

clirnaxing with the third and ﬁnal standing-

ovation of the night '
During a ﬁve—minute deliberation,

judges Chase Patterson,‘ from the Black ‘

Action Society; Joyce Giangarlo, the SGB
adviser; and Courtney Richardson, ’a Pitt
alumna, decided that three prizes were not
enough for the night’s performances.
Instead, they gave out four prizes, with
fourth place going to‘ Taylor, third place

going to Joy Ike, second place going to’

Kadita and Preeti, and ﬁrst place going to
Yeah. ’
Each performer was given a monetary

award of increasing value, with ﬁrst place =

receiving $500. -

Or, as Semaia exaggerated, enough »

money to buy half of a textbook

Volkan explores “Terrorist mentality’_’

Volkan, page 2

According to Volkan, the effects of hav-
ing no strong leadership to guide a regressed
group through the aftermath of a trauma can
be disastrous. One example in his writings is
the corruption of a marriage tradition in
South Ossetia, a region in the Eastern
European country of Georgia

For generations, the ritual of men “kid-
napping” a potential spouse in order to
marry her had been an innocuous, if c11ltur-
ally peculiar, act in Ossetian society. But the

fall of the Soviet Union and ﬁghting with the ~

Georgian government in the early .1990s

triggered a socio-economic collapse, accom-

als  'r- L’. as r r¢,e.e-’-

panied by a notable power vacuum. ‘
Society, Volkan said, without the moral

compass of a strong leader, allowed the

once—romant:ic ritual to become something
much darker and more violent, with increas-
ingly younger girls being -taken indiscrimi-
nately_to be raped,_rather ﬂtan married.

According to Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic

Foundation President Sandra Kryder,
VoIkan’s psychological examination of what
creates a_ terrorist was one of the reasons the
organization brought him to speak. _
“This is an opportunity for people to
explore ﬂrings like the topic of the terrorist
mentality,’ and what causes people to be

Has yourprofessor murdered anyone?

- A state representative is working .8

on legislation that would require all
colleges and
Pennsylvania ' to do criminal back-
ground checks on any.new faculty or
staff before hiring them. , i

-State Rep. Matthew Baker, R-
Tioga, is drafting the legislation in
light of last summer’s revelation con-
cerning Paul E; Kreuger, a former
professor at Pennsylvania State
University. Kreuger had been convict-
ed of a triple murder in Texas almost
40 years ago and was paroled in the
late 1970s.

Kreuger, who wasn’t required to
undergo a background check prior to
his employment at Penn State, left in
August amid controversy. Penn State
has since instituted background
checks on ‘all applicants.

The law is a terrible idea and an
unnecessary intrusion into the lives of
potential hires, not to mention a terrif-
ic waste of money.

If Kreuger were such a menace to
society, he would not have been
paroled. He committed a crime,
served his time, and was found com-
petent to re-enter society. Part of his
re-entry was earning his bachelor’s
and master’s degrees, and contribut-
ing to the higher education system —
certainly bettering himself in the
process.

universities in .

iBaker compares college teachers
to jdaycare workers and elementary
school teachers, noting that, in
Pennsylvania, ‘ background checks are
required of all teachers in school dis-
tricts. This is .a comparison that is as
insulting as it is inaccurate.

Being a daycare worker. or school-
teacherimplies a far greater degree of
responsibility for the lives of their
young charges, and it is right to
require background checks on them.
Daycare workers spend as many as
eight hours a day with their children,
and they can have a profound effect
on shaping the child’s values.

College teachers, on the other
hand, might spend as many as five
hours a week with adults in a non—cus—
todial setting. College students, for
the most part, are older than 18, and
are thus considered to be adults — a
very different situation than being a
child in daycare.‘ A

"The proposed legislation displays
a profound disrespect for th‘e'd’ecision

of the parole boardthat set -Kruegerl

free before many of his students had
been born. It also effectively turns
any sentence into a life sentence —

background checks ensure past mis- ‘

takes will follow people around forev-
er. Let colleges make this paternalis-

tic ruling on their own, if they must,

but don’t mandate it statewide.

Where to find third-wheel happiness

THE PITT NEws

To effect change, direct action is

Toward the end of April, while
most! of us are huddled away in
secluded corners of the
library, praying for a
quick and merciful end
to finals week, thousands
of others will be gather-
ing in Washington, D.C.,
for a sardonic celebra-
tion of the International
Monetary Fund’s7 and the
World Bank’s 60th birth-
days. ' 6

Those assembled

preferable to negative protesting

To some extent, Mohandas
Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and
' Nelson Mandela had it eas-

ier.
They were surround-
ed by obvious '-oppression

easily enough.
When a group of
blacks walks into a white
cafeteria and sits down, an
onlooker can quickly dis-
cern the injustice involved.
They’re speaking out

will chant and jeer and
march around.

The protest will be peaceful, but-
some will be arrested. ,

On the whole, the protesters will
feel good about themselves.

When the end of the second day
comes, everyone will leave, and
nothing will change.

They will return home to news
coverage that depicts them as rowdy
anarchists and sets images of scream-
ing students with dreadlocksnext to

footage of well—dressed World Bank

officials with clean fingernails speak-
ing in mannered tones. ” ' '

The commentators — and most
of the United States — will write off
the protesters as radically idealistic
youths with no conception of how the
“real” world works. A

To some extent, they’ll be right.

The impotency of their voices
will frustrate some, and anger will
grow inside them. R : ‘

Others, will write off the failure

by saying they raisedawareness.

‘ .-This, too, will ‘be true to Hsomle,

' A “ extent’, but not the extent neededltoi '

make any significant difference.

I realize I paint a rather dismal
picture. I

I ask my fellow activists to for-
give me for that.

I realize other pictures can be
painted.

But the one Iihave here is one that
we need to come to terms with.

What we’re doing isn’t working
well enough. '

Marching outside of a meeting
and yelling for those inside to stop

what they’re doing says very little to .

the moderates of the “nation watching
on_ television.

v Sure, a. few of them might be
curious enough to look into things for
themselves,,but the majority doesn’t
see any injustice. '

The main objective of a demon-
stration should be to communicate to
all of those who didn’t come out to
participate. I

This goal is not as simply reached
as it once was.

against injustice, but more
than that, by going to
where the injustice is perpetrated,
they are revealing the injustice for all
to see.

This is direct action.

It’s the most effective form of
protest and a means that can’t be used
in the United States with regard to
the movement in question.

Sure, showing up at a meeting of
the WTO and yelling is direct in the

sense that they are there, and lam‘

here, yelling directly at them.
But that is only direct for the pro-
tester. .
It doesn’t appear direct to the
onlooker. ’ 6
It’s almost counterproductive in
the sense that it’s easy for a black
person sitting at a whites-only lunch
table, demonstrating for his rights, to
appear righteous, while ‘a white kid
marching, screaming anti-this, anti-
that, is more easily written off as rad-
ical. I h
A What we, need in this country are
more p:()S,iti;‘Ve demonstration-s. ,

‘3 “ We can’t directly‘ reveal the injus- if

tices being perpetrated, but we can
directlyreveal what people‘ should do
to wash their hands of it. 0

Two hundred students coming out .

for fair-trade coffee, a three-block

. line outside of Quiet Storm, would

make people think a lot more than
two hundred students pumping signs
that demand the WTO stop every-
thing. . 

Two hundred students lined up
outside of Kiva Han would say a lot
more than those same students across
the ‘street
Starbucks.

This isn’t a fix-all suggestion. It’s
really just a start, a recommended
first step.

Ultimately, we have to recognize
the place and effectiveness of what
we’re doing and reevaluate every-_
-thing.

Laughs aren’t plentiful in “Anarchist”

Accidental Death of an

Anarchist

Through April 4

Starring Robert Dorfman, Sean
Runnette

Directed by Ron Jenkins
Pittsburgh Public Theater
(412) 316-1600

am/2 ‘

Pittsburgh Public Theater’s latest pro-
duction, “Accidental Death of an
Anarchist,” tries to show the funnier side of
the world of government conuption, media
manipulation and, of course, anarchy.

The show tells the story of a crooked
police force in Italy that is trying to pull off
their biggest cover-up ever. As far as the
public knows, a suspected anarchist was
being questioned in police custody when he
suddenly jumped out the window and fell to
his death. The fall is ruled a suicide, and the
case is closed. But then enters “The
Maniac.”

The Maniac (Robert Dorfman) is a
crazed madman who comes across the actu-

al ﬁles of the anarchist’s case. The facts
don’t seem to match up, and he intends to
ﬁnd out the truth. Using a few clever dis-
guises and the help of a newspaper reporter,
he uncovers a web of lies within the case.
While the plot may not sound funny,
the script by Dario Fo combines oVer-the-
top characters and quick, witty dialogue to
ensure a few laughs on the way. Fo’s Italian
script was translated and adapted for this
production by Ron Jenkins, and the latter
does a nice job of updating cultural refer-
ences within the play. What would a play
about government corruption be without
mention of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger?
The bulk of the play rests on the role of
the Maniac, and Dorfman does his best to

against Dorfrnan in his role as Inspector
Bertozzo. Unfortimately, he’s missing from
the middle of the show.

The comedy in the show is also missing
at times. The humor seems to come in
waves, and there aren’t enough consistent
furmy moments. ’ The highlight of
“Accidental Death of an Anarchist” is a

keep the crowd entertained. Looking a little ‘  

like Martin Short, Dorfman uses crazed
eyes and wild gestures to bring out the
Maniac. His lines come spewing out of his
mouth at auctioneer speed. And while he’s
certainly crazy, it’s hard to keep up with
what he’s saying.

The rest of the cast do their best to
match Dorfman’s antics, but many times
ﬂiey just come across looking like slapstick
Sidekicks. Runnette  his own

wonderfully performed musical number '

halfway through ﬂie show. The actors sing a
medley of tunes, by artists ranging from
Buffalo Springﬁeld to the Rolling Stories,
that makes the entire audience laugh upmar-
iously. Unfortimately, it only lasts about ﬁv
minutes. -

Winning Daysisistart Of bright future for Vines
Winning Days      A

Curiosity something that leads usall to The

 Vines. Afterﬂthe release of Highly Evolved, The

" *5.  -_  Vines found.-étléierhselves in a whirlwind of press

.and fame. All of the countless interviews with -

lead’ I-__'s_p'7$ger Craig Nicholls leave a person
intrigued. A certain mystery leads all music crit-

 ics"_and fanatics to trace’ a cult-like following
" behind The Vines. ’

The Vines sophomore effort, I/Vnning Days,
is more melodic than their first release, but
retains the fury and confusion they are known
for. Versatility is what carries this album to its
tlrree-star status. It’s a fusion of music from

‘ every era of rock, and it takes you from heavy

and rough to acoustic and melodic‘ and back
again. V
The album starts with their ﬁrst ‘single, and
probably their most radio-friendly effort on the
album. It has a poppy, fim feel with a steady gui-
tar rhythm, making it- a smart decision to intro-
duce the album with this song. Melodic and fun,
this song is a great way to start off the album.
When listening to the second track, “Animal
Machine,” the fury and rawness of Nicholls’
scratchy voice truly radiates through the ﬁrst sin-
gle. This is more of a representation of their ﬁrst
efforts as a band.
“TV Pro” starts with a psychedelic, trippy aura
and then bursts into heavy guitars for an awe-

..i

feel to it; it is a good display of The Vines’ versatility.
“Amnesia” has the same feel but at a slower pace.
“Autumn Shade 2” is an acoustic track that slows
down the pace of the album. Like the calm before the
storm, this track holds the same quietness and peaceful-

' ness. You almost expect to hear birds chirp as the song

fades into silence. The title song, “Winning Days,” and
“Sunchild” also follow that calm, soothing, acoustic
sound that adds melody to the mix. V
. “Evil Town” is also one of the quieter_ songs on the '

album, but it’s the best display‘ of  in Nicholls’
voice. The guitars don’t show the vehemence and pain
in the track as much as hisvocals, which carry the feel-
ing from the beginning to the end.

“She’s Got Something to Say to Me” is reminiscent
of an old Beatles song. " - . .

The last track, “F—k the World,” is the perfect
bookend for this album. “F——-k~the ﬁelds and/Destroy
the ocean/Roll the wheels up/Forget thenotion/Life’s so .
dead and/The form is slow/Ihe mind’s peculiar so/F—
k the world up.” , _ ' T ‘

Just let the lyrics speak for themselves. It would be

. a great encore song at their show. Imagine the song trail-

ing on as Nicholls continues rolling around on thelstage,

breaking everything in sight. Isri’t rock just beautiful?
Vlﬁnning Days is a great display of rock versatility.

It has just a taste of what is to come from one of the few I

bands that are ﬁghting to bring pure, raw rock back ‘onto .

the scene. , .

Up—and-comerHowie Day comes to Mr. Small’

It was a little more than four years
ago when no one outside of Maine knew
who Howie Day was or what he did.

Now, after years of successful tour-
ing and spreading the word about his
debut album Australia, Day has become
a household name.

Releasing Australia in 2000 on his
own, later to have the album picked up
and released by Epic, Day has sold over
100,000 copies of this freshman
attempt. Graduating from that first year,
Day has become extremely popular,
especially among college students
across the nation.

His sophomore album, Stop All the
World Now, was released earlier this
year and has kept the buzz going ‘about
Day. His powerful lyrics about love lost
and love gained and being alone, backed
by his intricate and. incredible guitar
Work, have won fans over and over
again. '

- Day sings with a bit of a raspy
croon, at, times hitting a nice falsetto
sound to accentuate the emotion already
present in his songs. The track “She
Says,” which Day wrote at the age of 17
— he’s now 22 -— was originally placed on
Australia. But the new version is a
cleaner studio rendition with which Day
is much happier. It’s a powerful song

that Day sings with a ton of emotion:

“When she ‘says she wants somebody
else, hope you know, she doesn’t mean
you / and when she breaks down and
makes a sound, you’ll never hear her the
way that I do.”

Day started touring as a solo act —
using live loops and delays to give the
feel of a band being present — but he
does it all by himself with his guitar. It’s

a very impressive live performance, and ‘

it is one that is never the same. Each
time he plays a song live, it is complete-
ly different than the -time before.

' He is wrapping up a supporting tour
with Barenaked Ladies and is then
going off on a headlining tour that
comes to Pittsburgh Wednesday, March
31 to Mr. Small’s Funhouse. ‘

He is touring later this year with a
band, marking the first time that Day
has ever toured with a band. But hope-

fully, it will add to his live performance 0
. rather than hinder it. '

Don’t “worry, faithful Howie Day
fans; when he makes his presence felt at
Mr. Small’s, it wiH be solo — just him,
his guitar and his delay pedals.

Howie Day will play an all-ages show
at Mr: Small is F unhouse on Wed., Mar
31. Showtime starts at 8 p.m. Tickets _
are $16 advance and $18 day of show.

Pitt already looking to future

‘ When a season ends unexpectedly
early, it’s only natural for players and
fans to begin thinking about getting
back and competing next year, t

The Pitt men’s basketball team was
no different, expressing thoughts about
next season just minutes after the 2003-
2004 campaign ended with a loss to
Oklahoma State in the Sweet 16. A

“We’ve got to work on our perime-

ter shooting. We need to be more effec-

tive on the offensive end.” A

While the Panthers return the bulk
of their offensive attack, the glaring
holes will be on defense and trying to
replace two of the best defensive play-
ers inirecent Pitt history in Julius Page
and Jaron Brown. A A

Together, in their four seasons at

Pitt, Page and Brown have started in
more than 230 games and scored more 1

than 2,700 points. Page (1,512) ranks

12th on the all-time scoring list at Pitt, a

while Brown (1,258) is 17th.

Individually, Page ranks first in min- A

utes played (4,398) and three—point

field goals (209), while Brown is sev— A

enth in steals (192) and 14th in assists
(295).

And, with Toree Morris — who is
10th all—time, with 79 blocks —— the trio
has combined to win the most games
by any senior class, posting a 107-30
record during the last four years.

The three have contributed to other

man in school history.

After finishing second in EWL

weight class, Kocher earned an auto-
matic berth to the NCAA

High expectations end in extreme disappointment

 

It’s deja vu all over again —
another NCAA Tournament, and
another Sweet 16 loss for Pitt.

Leading up to the Panthers’ game
against Oklahoma State, there was a
feeling that things would be different
this year. They had a new coach and a
new point guard. The location was
closer to home, and Pitt was some-
what the underdog. If you really want
to get down to it, the Panthers were
even wearing their blue jerseys
instead of their white, ones. _

In the end,‘that feeling was right,
and things were different, just not in a
good way. Pitt was handed its worst
defeat of the season —— for a team that/
lost only four prior games by only 10
total points, having a team beat you
by 12 is a blowout. Pitt’s previous
two round-of-16 losses were by a
combined eight points.

With expectations through the

roof heading into the month of March,

where did this team go wrong? The

players even said it themselves,‘ that
they felt this was the best chance they
had at making the Final Four. V

Instead, Pitt spent the finalfour

weeks of the season looking like a‘

team being led by a first-year coach
and an inexperienced point» guard.
Everyone’s got to be a first-time
head coach at some point, and not
many of them can say theywon more
than 30 games like Pitt’s Jamie Dixon
can. Hopefully, the next time Pitt
makes it to the Sweet 16, he will
know what coaching maneuvers need
to be made in order to advance.
Krauser is in a similar situation.

It’s tough for Krauser to have to V
replace Brandin Knight, who had-

been the heart and soul of the team for

two years. At times, Krauser. also ‘

tried to take on too much. A good
example of that came in the first five
minutes of last Thursday’s game. ‘

With‘ Pitt trailing 7-4, Krauser
grabbed a defensive rebound and
brought Pitt down the court. Instead
of setting up the offenseand getting a
good shot, Krauser pulled up for a
quick three, and Oklahoma State got
the ball back.

But at least Krauser had the»;

gonads t_o~take the team on his back in
tough situations when no one else
would. He did it successfully‘ against
Miami, twice against Boston College
and not so successfully against
Connecticut in the Big‘East final.

‘ Good thing he was around for
those games. Remember the closing

‘ seconds of. Pitt’s overtime loss to»

Syracuse, in which Krauser fouled
out? _
Without their point guard in the
game, the Panthers passed the ball
around the perimeter like a hot potato
untilsomeone was forced to put up a
shot. In fact, the only other player
with the stones to take the ball at the

end of the game was freshman

Antonio Graves.
Ultimately what hurt Pitt was that
it peaked at the wrong time. A

This team surprised everyone by"

starting the season 18-0 and rising up F

the rankings almost every week until
mid-February. By that time, the
Panthers werefon top of the Big East
— not to mention the world — and
looked like a lock to win the confer-
ence tournament and grab a No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament. _

, But then something happened.

bad luck, tighter rims —— but the

Panthers forgot how to get the ball in
the basket. ’

Over its final 10 games, Pitt "shot
just 41 percent, including five of their
worst shooting performances of the
season —— all of which were worse

than 37 percent. As much as"Dixon, ‘

may not have wanted to admit it,
scoring is a’ huge part of winning
games. ‘

It’s hard to find fault with a team
that sets a school record for wins in a
season and comes within three victo-
ries of the school’s longest winning
streak. But by now, making the Big

East Tournament final and the Sweet ,
, 16 are old news.

Thank you, Pitt basketball, for all of the great memories

SPOR A VIEW

  

Dear Jaron Brown, Julius Page and Toree Morris,

Thank you for an amazing four—year run.

In high school, I can remember the headlines
of all the newspapers when Pitt basketball play-
er Fred Primus was arrested near Philadelphia.
Pitt was put to shame. When I came -to Pitt two
years later, I came to what—I thought was a foot-
ball school, but thanks in a major part to you

three, I can nowproudly raise’ my, head come__
March and say, ‘yes I go to Pitt». and ama proud 1

Pitt Panther fan.

As a freshman, I went  the Pit:zlgerald,_Field..;;.,

House and watched a young team begin to gel.
The moment in time that put Pitt’s basketball
program back on the map was
Georgetown’. 1 , . -.

On January 20, 2001, Pitt upended a then-
undefeated Georgetown Hoyas team that was
thought to be among the top teams in the coun-
try. But not only did Pitt land back on the bas-
ketball map with this win, at a moment in this
game, Page became a household name in
Pittsburgh, dunking the ball over 7-footer Ruben

As sports journalists, we only get to go as far

as the team we are covering goes. Starting in that

magical 2000-01 season, the run to the Big East
Conference Championship game began a stretch
of media opportunities I was given, thanks to the
will of a Pitt basketball team to win. ~
This year, Pitt played in its fourth consecu-
tive Big East Tournament Championshipggame.

How many student journalists can say they have ’

been to four conference championship games?
Not many.

But if that wasn’t enough, you three brought
Pitt to three consecutive NCAA" Tournaments
and three consecutive Sweet 16s.

Only four other schools in the nation can say
they have been to the past three Sweet 16s, and
for a program like Pitt’s to g-o from jail to three

The basketball program will move on. Chris

Taft‘, Chevon Troutman and Carl Krauser, just to ‘
. name a few, will not let this program go down-

hill, but while they are phenomenal athletes and
personalities, Pitt is losing three key components
of its heart and soul.

Not many college athletes stay in school for
four years anymore. This senior class kept all
three of you for your entire eligibility. That is
dedication and commitment. This city and school
has grown with you. You are a part of Pitt, a part
of Pittsburgh and part of our families.

After Pitt beat Villanova this year on Senior
Day, standing behind the’ scenes as he always
does was assistant coach Barry Rohrssen. As I
sat there trying not to cry during the emotional
senior day ceremonies, I looked to my right to
see Rohrssen, maybe one of the toughest charac-

j ters I‘kn.ow, sobbing, with tears rolling down his A

checks as*if he’d lost a loved one. Rohrssen and
Pitt hadn’t lost a loved one — they had lost three
loved. ‘ones.

».-Thank you Jaron, Julius and Toree. No mat-

_ t_er,_ho.w well Pitt basketball does in the upcom-
, ing-years, no one will ever match what the three
_1 of_,_you.. guys did for this basketball program and

this ‘ university.

Brian Goldman is a staff writer for The Pitt
News, and to say he is thankful to these _seniors
for giving him theopportunity to meet amazing
people and go amazing places would be an
understatement.

The Panthers could receive big

Guards Antonio Graves and Yuri

either one could be .a candidate to ﬁll

However, in order to do that, Pitt would
have to lose a current player who is
