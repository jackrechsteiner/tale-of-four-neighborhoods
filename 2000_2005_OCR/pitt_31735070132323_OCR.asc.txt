West Africa coniictroots examined

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

To solve conﬂicts in West Africa, Buba Misawa wants to
stop looking so much to other nations for help, and to begin
looking at the history of conﬂicts in West Africa.

“Ifthere are root causes, and those root causes are struc-
tural, than we have to examine those structural causes,” he
Misawa, an associate professor of political science at
Washington and Jefferson College, in Washington, Pa, joined
Dr. Jean-Jacques Sene, a visiting professor from La Roche
College, in speaking at_a forum titled “Understanding The
Current Conﬂict in West Africa” last Monday.

“ V During the forum, which was a part of the World Alfairs

Council of Pittsburgh, the two presented their views for an

s hour and took questions from a crowd of around 50. Many of

those attending the forum saw it as a way to better understand

the conﬂicts in West Africa.

‘Too often we get caught up ir1 our own corners of the
world here,” said Dr. Joseph K. Adjaye, a Pit professor and
Chainnan of the Department of Africana Studies. “A fomm
like this gives people an opportunity to understand the world
beyond our own borders — especially an area, _like West
Aﬁica, that  Americans don’t know much about.”

' Misawa, the second speaker and a native of Nigeria,
described sorn_e of the economic problems stemming from
conﬂicts in West Africa, and the measures that various groups
have taken to end these conﬂicts.

Over the last 12 years, conﬂicts between hard-line
regimes and ﬁequenﬂy brutal rebel factions in several West
African courltiies have increased, he said The conﬂicts hurt
the economies of the nations in which they occur, but put a
focus only on conﬂict resolution and not economic’ growth

Americans are making best  
beers in world, speaker said

Beer, page 1

and a bottle of Aquaﬁna to cleanse their

palates between beers, as well as a plastic 1

bucket for any brew that they found particu-
larly distasteful. But senior Mike Hamidi
said that he wouldn’t need his.

“I’m not going to spit any out,” he said

Having just ﬁnished an exam, Hamidi
was ready to unwind. While leisurely tasting
brews such as Perktmo’s Hammer Imperial
Porter and Hacker-Pschorr, one of the origi-
nal Oktoberfest beers, he became fascinated
as Knipling detailed the rich history of beer.

“Beer precedes wine,” Knipling said, as
he described how it probably originated
when grain was left out in the rain before
being eaten by ancient cultures that discov-
ered the resulting “grue ” caused a pleasant
sensation. .

He said the earliest known beer
“recipes” were found on Sumerian clay
tablets dating back to 1800 B.C.

He went on to detail how scientists have
recently replicated a beer from the oldest
known beer residue found on a clay pot
unearthed from King Midas’ tomb in Turkey
about 20 years ago. I

' Hamidi said he was also interested by '0

how the word “cas ” is derived from the
ancient Egyptians, who used a similar word
for beer, which they used as currency.

Those who built the pyramids were_sus— 4

tained, in part, by eating beer porridge.
Many other cultures used beer as food,
Knipling said. While they were fasting,
monks still drank beer that they brewed
themselves, which they called “liquid
bread.” Knipling used such stories to
demonstrate how European and other older

cultures have a deeper respect for beer than
Americans.

But that’s changing, he added, now that
“Americans are making the best beers in the
world American“ ingenuity is pushing the
envelope.”

The advent of microbreweries has made
it possible for this ingenuity to be noticed,
under the shade of more popular beers such
as the ones seen on commercials, which

Knipling ﬁnds inferior because of their use _

of com, a cheaper substitute for hops and
barley, in the brewing process.

“Prohibition ruined" the value of
American beers,” Knipling said. “When it
ended in 1933, everybody scrambled to
make beer as fast as they coul .” it

0 America’s mainstream beer culture '

never recovered from that “cheapness,” he
added.

Students asked Knipling questions as
they passed around fresh sprigs of hops only
an hour off the vine. 1

One girl screwed up her face at the taste
of He’Brew Genesis Ale, made by the

Schmaltz Brewing Company, although her ‘

ﬁiend seemed pleasantly surprised by it.
“I don’t expect them to like all-of the
beers,” Knipling said. “I’m trying to give

them a wide rangeof tastes,” such as the.

banana and citrus-‘ﬂavored Moonglow
Weizenbock and Troeg’s Oatmeal‘ Stout

from Pennsylvania and Rycerskie Strong, -

made by Poland’s oldest brewery.

Pitt senior’ Tanya McGregor appreciated
the diversity of the beers.

“You never really get the opportunity to

try something new like that —— you’ll just go

to the bar and drink Yuengling and Miller
Lite,” she said.

Bouquet, page 1

“We don’t like skinny people,” Molly
says laughing. “Wait! Except for Kiran!”

Back to latent “Inside Edition” infused
with discussion, the girls sort of watch the

dos and don’ts of creating soap opera love

scenes. _ .
They’re shocked that the man wears
ﬂesh colored boxers while the woman wears
only a g-string. Even more shocking is that a»
particular soap opera vixen shimrnied
around in her skivvies in nearly 15 “love-
' g” scenes. 1 0

‘‘Maybe she likes g—strings,” ‘Molly.

says. . V
“Yeah, it’s not like she was complain-
ing,” Kiran adds. “Fifteen! She’s like a soap
opera whore!” ,

Asthe show moves on to more impor-
tant topics, like the California elections,
Molly divulges that she’s the only
Republican_ in a group of seriously

 Women talk politics,   g—strings 1

Democratic popcom—eating, fondue-loving
girls. _
“I feel like it’s really hard to be conser-
vative in college,” Molly says.

And who can blame her? She’s obvi-

ously outnumbered in this group of girls.
Molly expresses the importance of the

fact that President Bush isn’t the only man
A nmning America, and seems to sympathize

with him because he takes a signiﬁcant
amount of the criticism. A H _ .
“I think 'he’s cute,” Molly says. “He

looks huggable.”

“I would never hug George Bush,”
Kiran deadpans. » .
» “I think he needs a hug,” Molly says
with a smile. _ ‘_ g
The girls begin debating doing some

» work, and Kiran thinks ofpgoing to the

library.
“Nothing ever gets done here,” Moira
says.
Well, yeah, but that’s reality.

The Economic Community of .West
African States, a loose organization of 16
.West African countries, has used military
tactics to attempt to stabilize the region since
1990. In the name of regional security, the
organization used its military branch to
deploy troops to Conﬂict areas. 3

Larger powers‘ in the region, like ,_
Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal, generally bear .-

most of the burden of  the
troops, according to Misawa ’ ' V

branch, he. said. The United States more fre-

The American government, Misawa_

said, has aided the orgarrization by.pI’0.V'idi'ng

direct aid, training,'a1ms and, injthe ’
case of Liberia, a small number of American '

peacekeeping troops. He. believes such

actions are meant to eventually establish

American  bases in West Africa.
More than 50 cease-fires have been cre-
ated in response to West Aﬁican conﬂicts
since 1990, according to Misawa. He said
West Africans see these conﬂicts as a “con-

' tagion” that can affect even seemingly stable

nations. - T .

He used the example of the Ivory Coast,
which was once seen as a model of eco-

Before Misawa spoke, Sene, a citizen of '

Senegal, described the historical issues that
have played a part in current social unrest
and war in theregion. According to Sene,
current conﬂicts in countries like Liberia

 from a long history of invasion and
exploitation of the region by foreign powers.

Sene used the “Dependency Theory” to
describe the currenteconornic problems in
the region in the context of European colo-
nialism. The theory states that imperialism

and colonialism carried out by European
' powers in places like West; Aﬁica create"

African colonies dependent upon the
resources of theirEuropean masters.
Even‘ after countries. achieved their

independence, Sene said, many did not have .

He compared the current turmoil in the .

countries that achieved independence after

' World War II to a mid—life 

. A “There’s a growth  Likea man
after forty years, many WestAfrican nations

The Cold War again placed West Africa -

in the role of a pawn to Westernnations,
according to Sene. The resulting ascendance

region should not have come as a surprise,
he added \

’ “West Africa became an entity where,

Limbaugh inappropriate, uniformed

. We all knew it was coming. Rush
Limbaugh, former commentator on
ESPN’s “Sunday NFL Countdown”
said something insensitive, displayed
his astounding lack of football
knowledge and, resultantly, resigned
from the show on Oct. 2.

His remarks concerned three-
time pro—bowler Donovan McNabb,
quarterback for the Philadelphia
Eagles. “The media has been very
desirous that a black quarterback do
well  he got a lot of credit  that
he didn’t deserve.”

Commenting on a player’s per-
formance is legitimate. Commenting
a player’s race, as a means of dis-
counting his performance, is not, and
Limbaugh’s comments were severely
out of line.

Limbaugh may not have intended
to make racist comments; he
remarked in a statement that they
“were not racially motivated.”

But accidental racism is still
racism. Remember, these remarks
come from a man who once said on
his show, “Have you ever noticed
how all newspaper composite pic-
tures of wanted criminals resemble
Jesse Jackson?”

Obviously, Limbaugh has issues
with minorities. And putting him in a
setting where he is discussing ath-
letes from all different racial and cul-
tural backgrounds invited controver-

sy — though that seems to be what
ESPN wanted. 9

Football — like all sports —-
relies on statistics to track exactly
how far its players run and throw,
and how much they win. By taking
these quantifiable things into
account, commentators can distin-
guish a good player from a bad one.
This is not to say that football is
without racial politics — but ideally,
it shouldn’t be. .

What Limbaugh said was repre-
hensible, and he was right in quitting.

Moreover, ESPN had no business
putting someone so far removed from
sports on a sports show. If the station
wanted better ratings, it should have
invested in people with actual sports
expertise, rather than a man with an
inﬂated ego andtlittle to say about
sports. .

If everyone were to follow this
poorly set model,_ Ann Coulter would
be hosting Trading Spaces, and
Michael Moore commenting on dog
racing.

Sports has its share of controver-
sy, without actively seeking it. Would
it have been so hard to find an actual
commentator — one with qualifica-
tions other than playing football in
high school? Why turn the camera on
someone who really has nothing to
say, and does so in the most offensive
way possible‘?

In Response to: “California recall good
for a laugh, at least’’ .

Allow me to start by saying that Mr.
Ferris’s factless article is typical of the lib-
eral/secularist ideology that is published
by The Pitt News on an almost daily
basis. .

I must remind you that in his article
Republicans were referred to by Mr.
Ferris as “the soldiers of darkness.”

Mr. Ferris states, “Do I know the
point of this [recall].” Let me begin by
saying that, in a new record, the number
of Californians leaving the state exceeded
new arrivals by over one hundred eight
thousand last year.

This is because California leads the
country in taxes, energy prices and work-
er’s compensation cost and average fami-
lies just can’t make it Davis engaged in
massive deception during the gubemator-
ial race by deliberately misleading the
public about the V magnitude of
California’s ﬁscal crisis, which suddenly
and mysteriously mushroomed after he
won reelection Basically, took'a 12
billion dollar surplus and then, in no time,
caused it to mushroom into a 38 billion,
yes billion with a ‘b,’ dollar deﬁcit He did
this through his socialistic entitlement and
social service programs, which the state
provides forever '30 million citizens, but
can’t pay for, even with taxes through the
roof! The ‘cost of doing business in
California is now 32 percent higher _than
the national average. State spending
increased 40 percent in four years under
Davis, even while less and less tax money
was coming in, because California busi-
nesses could no longer afford to operate
there due to Gray Davis’s policies.

Mr.Ferrisreferstotherecallan
“implosion of democracy” and “trying to
overthrow the republic” but this could not

 

be further from the truth. The California
recall represents democracy at its ﬁnest
The people in that state are fed up with_
how Davis has handled things, and they,
the people of California, have decided to
execute their rights as Californians and
Americans and vote to get Davis out of
there so that order can be restored to the
state.

U.S. invasion of Iraq unjustified, but has good, if unintended, effects

As of seven months ago, conservatives
and liberals alike knew that we were going to
invade Iraq. Conservatives proclaimed that,
in doing so, we’d discover vast stockpiles of
serious weapons. Liberals warned that the
war would undoubtedly leave Iraq in a
bloody civil war between Sunnis and Shiites
in the south, making a successful reconstruc-
tion nearly impossible. .

Well, the weapons aren’t
anywhere to be found and out-
side of Baghdad things are pret— ‘
ty much at ease. Even in
Baghdad things aren’t all that
bad. What the hell? i I

I’m not sure if our govern-

  

Americans should now agree that Bush was
wrong. But from  many people have
concluded that that means the pre-war liber-

.. als were right in all that they said.

Finding someone ready to recite that
we’ve madea mess of Iraq, that they don’t
want us there and our. forces do nothing but
antagonize the local population, is as easy as
taking a stroll through Oakland.

‘ " These ideas are just as
unfounded as the government’s

Regardless, it’s safe to say that they couldn’t

Iraqis for the attacks being sustained by

Rock ‘n’roll elementary

School of Rock

Starring Jack Black, Joan
Cusack, Mike White

Directed by Richard Linklater
ﬂrikikt/2

CHAD EBERLE
Senior Staff Writer

“School of Rock” could easily end up
being the biggest surprise of the fall — a
comedy, produced by a major studio, that’s
hip, smart, irreverent and hilarious, while all
the while family—f1iendly. And it’s the best
showcase to date for madman-savant Jack
Black. . , _

If Black doesn’t rise to movie star sta-
tus with this ﬁlm, he never will. And that
would suck. The actor — and rocker —— hits
home run after home run in this role, which
was \written expressly‘ for him by Mike
White (big, goofy comedies “Dead Man on
Campus” and “Orange Country” and indie
dramas “Chuck.'& Buck” and “The Good
Gir ”).

White ingeniously gives J.B. a class-
room full of kids as a forum in which to go
nuts —- the actor’s performance is far too
volatile to have been entirely scripted —
while inhabiting a persona that’s some-
where between the ferociously snobby
music fan he played in “High Fidelity” and
the obnoxiously cocksure “rock g ” he
becomes when rocking out with his band
— really just he and ' Kyle Gass —
Tenacious D. The maniac leaves so little

oxygen for anyone else on screen that Joan
Cusack’s performance is almost a casualty.
Almost.

Black’s character is Dewey Finn, a
deadbeat and rock music devotee who can’t
even pay his roommate Ned (writer Mike

White), an ex-rocker who sold outrand is on
his way to becoming a teacher, all the rent
he owes unless his band wins an upcoming
competition. After he’s kicked out _of the
band for his embarrassing antics, like 20-
minute solos and drunken stage—diving, a
chance phone call offers Dewey a way to
earn the cash: posing as Ned for an extend-

/ ed subbing‘ gig teaching ﬁfth grade at an

upscale private school. ,

The setup is silly and farfetched, but
once the ﬁlm gets rolling, you won’t mind a
bit.

Dewey’s initial teaching approach isgto
make the students have recess all the time.
That’s until he ﬁnds out that their intense
music classes havemade them skilled clas— ._,
sical musicians. Dewey needs ’ a band;
they’ll be perfect if he can just teach them to
rock. The School of Rock is born — under
the guise of a class project, of course.

Two kinds of music are used brilliantly-
in the ﬁlm. There are the ‘rock classics,_
songs by AC/DC-, the Who, the Ramones,
Led ~ Zeppelin and more, that place us in
Dewey’s world. Then there is the music that
we get to seecreated in the film. The child’
actors are the real thing — at age 10, they’re
accomplished musicians. The sequences in
which they and Black assemble and ﬁne-
tune songs —— often in real time — are enor-T
mously exciting. Indie director Richard
Linklater (“Dazed and Confused” and
200l’s “Tape” and “Waking Life”), ‘who is ‘
selling out in a most glorious fashion, keeps
these scenes, which are often lengthy and
conﬁned to the classroom,‘ incredibly loose
and lively. The result is magic.

“School of Rock” is the rare ﬁlm that I
feel comfortable recommending - to
absolutely anyone. It has the potential to be
a huge hit at the box oﬁice —" and it actual-‘
ly deserves to be. i »

Rising waters

Those living in the Pittsburgh area
have certainly heard of the famed Frank
Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater, an elaborate
house built in the 1930s. Even if you have
never actually seen the house up close
and personal, you have surely seen repre-
sentations of the architectural achieve—
ment.

Pitt Professor of Art and Architecture
Franklin Toker has dedicated 18 years of
research to the ‘book of all books on
Fallingwater. Released last week, The
New York Times gave rave reviews to
“Fallingwater Rising.” Not only does it
chronicle Fallingwater itself, it looks at
the man who commissioned Wright to do
the work: E. J. Kaufmann, of Pittsburgh’s
Kaufmann’s department stores. The book
also discusses the impact that the Great

Depression had on the renowned project.

Toker’s presentation of his extensive

_ research is sure to put Pitt on the map —.

not that it isn’t already. It will put us on a
different sort of map, not one of sports or
biomedicine, but on the map as an archi-

tectural artistry community — perhaps it '

will make up for Posvar Hall.

You may not be able to travel the 45 .

miles to Bear Run tovvisit the place, and
while it would be difficult to read all 479
pages of the book in two days, you can ——
and should -— get your fill of
Fallingwater knowledge this weekend,
because Toker will be talking about his
book in person.

The event takes place on Sat., Oct. 4 at 2
pm. at the Carnegie Music Hall.
Admission is free. Look for a review of
“Fallingwater Rising” in the upcoming
weeks in The Pitt News.

Benefit to pay tribute to The Clash

This Saturday, The Rex Theatre will host an elaborate tribute to
The Clash in which over two dozen musicians from various local
groups will come together to perform a lively set of Clash material,
largely as a nod to the band’s front man Joe Strummer, who died last
December. ‘E

Rod Schwartz, member of local band 11th Hour and one of the
primary planners of the tribute show, said, “Any of today’s bands, if

they’re being honest, would admit to being inﬂuenced by The '. if
Clash.” Schwartz is joined by a number of participating local musi-j _
cians in hoping that the evening will be an outlet for Clash fans to “ a

both pay their respects and enjoy themselves. I   »
According ‘ to Schwartz, garnering local participation , and

enthusiasm for the event hasn’t been difficult at all. Among the

musicians playing on Saturday are members of ATS, llth Hour,

The Spuds, Submachine, The Affordable Floors, The Cheats and

many others.

The evening’s performances will be divided into two sets, each
running an hour and a half. The ﬁrst set will be a much—practiced,
live run—through of The Clash’s classic album London Calling. The
second set will feature selections from The Clash’s other records.

Proceeds from the event will beneﬁt the Greater Pittsburgh
Food Bank and homeless shelter Bethlehem Haven. This, organiz-
ers feel, is in line with The Clash’s ideals.

. With all the energy and passion poured into this event, it’s look-
ing to be quite a lively celebration. As Schwartz puts it, it’ll be “Sort
of like a big Irish wake — with guitar!”

The Clash tribute concert will be held at The Rex Theatre on the
South Side on'Sat., Oct. 4., at 8 p.m Admission is $7.99 and will
beneﬁt the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank and Bethlehem Haven.

This is a conspiracy that isn’t a theory

Daybed

Wellwater Conspiracy
Transdreamer/Megaforce
Records

i‘4'i‘r7i‘r1/2

Recommended if you like: Pearl
Jam, Soundgarden

For all you conspiracy theorists,
there’s a conspiracy ﬂoating around
that is getting some attention. It has
been lying dormant since 1997, but
2003 is shedding some light on it.
Wellwater Conspiracy, headed by
current Pearl Jam drummer Matt
Cameron, Ben Shepherd of
Soundgarden fame’ and John
McBain of Monster ..Magnet, is out
to make you skeptics into believers.

The most recent album released
by Wellwater Conspiracy, Daybed,
is a sophisticated integration of an
abundance of different sounds. The
elements in each song make them
truly unique from one another. The
album begins with “Wimple Witch,”
which isreminiscent of l950’s surf
rock. You can almost imagine
Annette Funicello and Frankie
Avalon shaking it on the beach to
the catchy and almost frantic drum-
ming, which rushes the rest of the
song, giving it an upbeat,’ dance-like
quality. The opening bars of

“Galaxy” sound eerily familiar to
The Turtles’ “Happy Together,” but

that’s where the comparisons end,

The rest of the track goes on to have
a long jam with “Ooos” thrown into
the mix every so often.

The highlight of the album is the
airy cover of Tommy Petty and the
Heartbreakers’ “Something in the
Air.”.It’s a classic song that would
be easy to beat down in comparison
with other covers, but the
Conspiracy takes a refreshing angle.
But don’t think that all of Daybed is
evocative of earlier eras: “Rebirth”
is a lyricless, synthesized four-
minute-and-31-second-long, track
with a sense of «urgency. ,

~>.-:.,B‘aybed_,is ‘an eclectic journey
into the brains of talented musi-
cians. There is a lot of dissonance
on this album — arguably too much
dissonance, “which could strain a
sensitive ear, but here it just makes
the album that much more interest-
ing. With so many bands out there
trying to concentrate their efforts on
becoming a carbon copy of another

band, Wellwater Conspiracy is a a

breath of fresh air. The Conspiracy
is out there doing something that
many other bands are scared to do
— play exactly what they feel
inside.

Crochunis excels
onand off the field

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

Vince Crochunis has enjoyed
success on the football field, as well
as in the classroom. But the 6-foot-
4-inch, 290 pound, senior nose
tackle _has also had to endure hard-
ship; _

' At an age‘ when most kids are

only worried about getting their dri-A
ver’s license, Crochunislhadto cope ‘

with the passing of his father.

“He passed away when I was 15,’

and it wasjsomething that helped

me grow up real fast,” he said. “I ‘

had to take care of my Mom a lot.”

Crochunis’ father was always
therefor him while he was growing
up, and proved to be a positive role
model for his son.

‘ “He always supported‘ me and‘

that’s all that really mattered to me,
just him being by my side and mak-

ing sure everything went well for

me,” Crochunis said.‘

After losing his father,
Crochunis received guidance from
his high school football coach, John
Davis, who always made sure that

he kept his priorities straight.

“He taught me a lot about foot- 1

ball, and S a lot about 1 life,”
Crochunis said of his high school
football coach. . .
Crochunis has always Worke
hard and taken his studies seriously,
and last year, ‘he was rewarded for
his dedication. He was selected as a

superior performance in the class-
room. ’ _ .
Crochunis is proud of all of his

‘achievements, but being named an
fAcademic All-American holds. a

special meaning for him.

“I think it’s the best honor you
can get, because it demonstrates
that you can succeed both athleti-
cally and academically,” Crochunis
said. “I was pretty excited, when.I

found out I was an Academic All-I
, American.’ Coming into college, I

knew I was going to’ work hardin

school;--1. knew I was going to do

well. But the athletic part, I didn’t
know I would be able to succeed in

' that. I’m kindof humbled about it.”_

Crochunis also received the
Most Improved Defensive Player

’ award in 2002, but maintained the

same modest attitude when talking
about it.
“I was really surprised,” he

said. “It was kind of shocking. I.

thought someone else was going to
get it. There’s a lot of guys out
there with freakish talent and insane
abilities. I always thrived on just
working hard and always making
sure I’m where I’m supposed to
be.”

When Crochunis was deciding
which college to attend, he had
more than just athletics going for
him. His academic abilities were a
major strength and garnered atten-
tion from many‘ elite universities. -.

“I wasn’t a big time recruit,”

Crochunis said. “I had a lot of Ivy ‘

League schools looking at me. I vis-
ited a couple of [them], but I didn’t
really see myself fitting in.”

But looking back, Crochunis
thinks things might have been dif-
ferent. j

“That was when I was 18, but

“Coach [Walt] Harris and his staff
really sold me on what the future
would entail.” V
There is yet another quality that
makes Crochunis a unique individ-
ual. He is a triple major, which is
interesting, considering all of the
time he has to spend each week
doing football-related activities.

The Pitt .men’s soccer team (3-7-0) defeated
Niagara (O-6-1) Wednesday,isnapping the Panthers’
three-game losing streak. ~ I '

Pitt defeated Niagara 1-0 in what head "coach Joe
Luxbacher called a tough, close game.’ It was a repeat
performance for the Panthers, who beat Niagara 1-0
last year at Founder’s Field.

“When a team loses a lot of games by one point,
it starts to be expected,” Luxbacher said. “Our team’s

competitive, and we’re starting seven freshmen. To
win, a »team’s got to make the play; yesterday we made
the play and won. The team played better and more
consistent against Niagara.«We were solid from start to
ﬁnish.” A

Pitt outshot Niagara 15-12 to win the game. The
Panthers’ only goal came in the 44th minute,‘ when
forward Keeyan Young beat Niagara goalie Dan
O’Shea to the ball and ﬁnished the shot. More than
half of ‘Pitt’s shots were on goal, creating numerous
scoring opportunities. , -

Niagara came away from the game scoreless

Panthers snap losing streak with win over Niagara

whilepicking up three yellow cards. It had a total of
16 fouls to Pitt’s 20. ,

The Panthers’ keeper, Justin Lowery, recorded a
shutout by stopping all six of Niagara’s shots on goal.

“[To continue winning], our key players have to
play well in tough games,” Luxbacher said.
“Everyone else needs to continue playing solid. We
haven’t been getting that, and we need it. We’Ve been
in positions to win and haven’t had those plays, while
the other teams have.”

Pitt’s next game is Sunday at noon against Notre
Dame at Founder’s Field.

Notre Dame prepares for Panthers’ offensive attack

JOE HETTLER
The Observer (U. Notre Dame)

(U—WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind.-—
Kent Baer doesn’t consider the bye
week a week off. The Irish defen-
sive coordinator said the team
works just as hard this week as

weeks when there is a game.

“We work pretty hard during a
bye week,” Baer said. “[Tuesday]
was a long practice and a hard prac-
tice and a physical practice.”

The Irish have two weeks to
prepare for a road contest against
No. 18 Pitt on Oct. 11. Notre Dame

is coming off a 23-10 loss to Purdue
and is just 1-3 after losing three
straight games. _

Despite the poor start, coach
Tyrone Willingham was pleased
with the team’s performance in
practice Tuesday.

“[It was a good practice] for the
fact that we had an opportunity to
go out and start to get some work
in,” Willingham said. “Our young
men practiced very well and
brought a certain level of energy
and focus and that was good.”

Willingham said he looks at this
week and the rest of the season in a

positive light, rather than dwellingllii

on the losses. If the team begins to-
think negatively, the rest of :the;j: sea-

/at every position,” Diedrick said..
’‘‘It’s‘ ‘a similar format that you

would have during a normal week.

But the things you stress are a little

more individual than group.”
While the Irish offense’s ability

‘(may be questioned, the Panthers’ -is

not, led ‘by quarterback Rod
Rutherford and wide receiver Larry
Fitzgerald. Rutherford has complet-
ed 61.7 percent of his passes for
1,171 yards and 16 touchdowns
while only throwing three intercep-
Hisr favorite target is
Fitzgerald, who has nine touch-
downs and 32 receptions for 583

“[Rutherford] is a, great scram-

bler-and he_'has a good arm, but he

also has_a lot of weapons,” Baer
said. “He’s playing with a lot of
confidence right now.”

Baer also said containing
Fitzgerald will be a challenge.

“If [Fitzgerald] isn’t the best
wide receiver we’ll face, he’s darn

close,” he said.

’ Pitt opened its year with a 43-3
beating of Kent State before dou-
bling up Ball State 42-21. Toledo

then upset the Panthers 35-31. Last‘

week, Pitt had its “most impressive
game with a 37-26 victory over
Texas A&M.
