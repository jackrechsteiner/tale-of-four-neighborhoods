Draft of computin
spending $9.6

.long—anticipated
comprehensive plan
for improving Pitts-

burgh campus computer usage
calls for Pitt to spend $9.6 mil-

. lion over the next three years. .

Titled “An Information
Technology Foundation for the
21st Century,” a draft ofthe plan
has been distributed to several
University Senate committees,
the Dean’s Council and academic
units, according to Robert Pack,
vice provost for Academic Plan-
ning and Resources Manage-
ment.

The plan was prepared by the

provost-chaired Information .

tee (ITSC), which has been

Pitt’s infrastructure, computing
equipment and facilities, and
computing support on the Pitts-
burgh campus. (For details of
the plan, see box on page 3.)
Pack presented an overview
ofthe plan to the Senate budget
policies committee (BPC) Jan.
14; He stressed the document
was a draft. “Like the Facilities
Management plan, there will be
input from around the Univer-
sity. The provost plans to re-
spond in writing to suggestions
and say why some are accepted
and some rejected,” Pack ex-
plained. He said Provost James
‘M‘aher is asking for written re-
sponses by March 17. The pro-
vost is expected to present an
overview of the plan to Faculty
Assembly Jan. 25, Pack said.
“What is clear is that the cur-
rent levels ofservice are not ad-
equate or appropriate and the
University has not made consis-
tent levels of effort to keep us
competitive in this area,” Pack
told BPC. “The administration
recognizes this. Infrastructure
has been neglected. So signifi-
cant upgrades are needed and
new ‘services are required, and
it’s not inexpensive.”
‘ Pack said Pitt is in relatively
good shape because the campus
is heavily_ networked with fiber
as a result ofthe Campus ofthe
Future efforts of. the 19805.
“More good news is that most of
the'$9.6 million is for one—time
costs, with $1.1 million ‘of it in
continuing costs. We’ve also put
in for a $2.5 million one—time
request for state appropriations
for this, which, if approved,-

would make a big dent in the 

$3.8 million neededin year 1,”

 

Pack said. -

But BPC and other groups n

will have to grapple with where
the rest of the money‘ will come
from, he added. “In some in-
stances, money will have to be
moved from other lesser priori-
ties at the University. And in
some cases, costs will move to
the individual units.”

An unspecified portion of the
costs will be recovered by an
optional fee for faculty and staff
who want improved remote ac-

cess computer services, accord-
ing to the plan. Currently, the
University maintains 800 mo-
dems, not enough to prevent off-
campus users from getting an-
noying busy signals, especially
during peak evening hours.‘
Pack said Pitt is negotiating
with an Internet service provider
(ISP) .for a preferred partnership
that will offer a monthly fee op-
tion for employeespseeking bet-
ter service. A
“We hope to announce an

ISP vendor next month,” Pack
said, declining to name the ven-
dor. “‘We’ve been reluctant to
respond to individual issues, such
as a potential fee for facultyfor

remote access, without the whole

context ofthis plan. VVhat you’ll
be paying for, ifyou so choose, is
not the same service, but better
service.” _

He added that the University
will bear the cost for building a
tunnel to house wiring from the
ISP vendor to Rll)C Park in
Ilarmarville, where the Pitts-
burgh campus’s 0 central relay
computing facility is located.

The modem pool service also
should improve, Pack said, be-

Attending the Jan. 18 press conferenceannouncing the establishment of an International .
Traditional Chinese Medicine Center at Pitt were, from left: Ronald Herberman, Pitt associate
vice chancellor for Research, Health Sciences, and directcir of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute; Yongzheng Hui and Chuan-hong Chen, vice minister and director, respectively, of the
Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. ~

International center set up here to

ome of the 2 1st century’s
reakthrough drugs for
treating cancer and neu-
rological diseases could be de-
rived ’ from traditional remedies
developed in China over the last
3,000 years. ,
That’s the hope among re-
searchers at a new center to be‘

based at Pitt and the UPMC

_ Health System.

The International Tradi-

tional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 0

Center will use modern'fechnol—
ogy and research methods to test
the effectiveness ofTCM — and,
ideally, develop new drugs and
win U.S. Food and Drug Ad-

‘ ministration approval for mar-

keting them.

"As early as six months from
now, the center could launch its
first clinical trial of“at least one
or two” Chinese herbal mixtures

that appear to‘ stimulate the
body’s immune system to fight
cancer, said Ronald I-Ierberman.

Herberman, director of the
University ofPittsburgh Cancer
Institute and Pitt associate vice
chancellor of Research, Health
Sciences, was among the Uni-
versity and UPMC I-Icalth Sys-

tem administrators and faculty

members who met here on Jan. .

18 with representatives of local
foundations and China’s Minis-
try of Science and Technology.
At a press conference later
that day, meeting participants
described the International
TCM Center as the first system-
atic, large—scale international ef-
fort to develop scientific and
clinical standards for traditional
Chinese remedies. ‘
Among Western scientists,
opinions of TCM range from

study traditional Chinese medicine

“the utmost enthusiasm” to “pro-
found skeptieism,” said Thomas
Detre, UPMC executive vice
president for international and
academic programs and director
of international affairs..

“Yet we have, historically, in
China some 3,000 years ofexpe-
rience with plant products which
have been said to be helpful with
the treatment ofa variety ofcon—
ditions,” Detre said. “These ex-
periences cannot be ignored. But
they are, by themselves perhaps,
insufficient to [justify allowing
TCM to] enter the American

market and be safely consumed ‘

by large numbers ofpeople suf-
fering from various disorders.”

tivities will focus on:

  arguments

now before
Common
Pleas judge

he latest round of le-
gal briefs were filed in
theAlleghenyCounty
CourtofCommon Pleas recently
by attorneys for Pitt and the seven
complainants in the “llenson
case” —— a controversial civil suit
over the University’s denial of
health benefits to same—sex part-
ners of faculty and staff. .
Last month, Pitt asked Com-
mon Pleas Court _ludge Robert

‘C. (iallo to end the class action
suit, which was filed in l‘{‘)(i by

ifoi'iinei"l’litt legal writinginstruc-
tor l)eborah llenson..'lihe suit
alleges that the University vio-
lated the city’s l‘)‘)() anti—dis—
crimination ordinance by deny-
ing health insurance benefits to
her lesbian partner. Six current
employees have joined llenson
in the legal action.

Pitt argues that the city ordi-
nance (which forbids,dis'crimi—
nation based on sexual prefer-
ence) was not meant to compel
employers to offer benefits to
same—sex partners. Pitt also
maintains that state legislation
enacted last i\'oveml)er exeinpts
state—related universities from
city ordinances requiring such
benefits.

The I lenson case currently is
before the Pittsburgh Human
Relations Commission (I IRC).
But Pitt attorneys have taken
their_objections to Common
Pleas Court, arguing that the
IIRC lacks jurisdiction in the
case because the University is
exempt from the city ordinance.
(Pitt also notes that the HRC
itself, like most other city em-
ployers, does not offer health
benefits to same—sex partners of
its employees.)

The University has asked
‘Common Pleas judge Callo to
issue a preliminary injunction
ending the four—year-old legal
battle.

Lawyers for I lenson and her
fellow complainants argue, in
turn, that Common Pleas Court
itself lacks jurisdiction overithe
Henson case and that proceed-
ings should continue before the

and Lothrop Streets to minimize
dust getting into the building.’

Iixtra signs have been posted
around the buildings to urge
people to keep outside doors and
windows closed.‘“But much of
what we’ve done is word-of-
mouth to staff, in addition to
keeping them updated through
our weekly newsletter,”
Krystofiak said.

Lawrence Keller, director of
Pitt’s Department of Environ-
mental Ilealth and Safety, said
efforts of his staff during the
construction project are concen-
trated in Scaife, Salk and the
Graduate School of Public
I lealth, where some labs need to
be kept contaminant—frce.

“We reviewed all the build-
ings’ systems. We monitor those
continually, checking their ven-
tilation systems and setting the
filter capacities to their highest
levels.”

tractors also take precautions by
watering down dusty areas on
demolition sites. “And some-
times the prevailing winds can
help alleviate the dust concen-

Both Krystofiak and Keller
agree the greater danger is dur-
ing demolition, not construction.
“Demo"lition is more problem-

“There’s always a cloud of

bottom line is that the general
University population is not at

Charles Gray Watson

A memorial service for
Charles Gray Watson, a Pitt cli-
nician and surgery professor

since 1968, will be held this Sun- _

day at 1 1 a.m. in Ileinz Memo-
rial Chapel. ,

The service also will honor
his father and fellow surgeon,
_]ames Rose VVatson, who died
three months ago. I

Charles Watson, 63, died, of
respiratory failure at UPMC
Presbyterian I lospital onjan. 16,
2000, four months after being
admitted with a lung ailment.

Pitt surgery department
chairperson Timothy Billiar
called Watson a gifted endocrine
surgeon and “our pre—eminent

' surgical educator,” one who was

admired, and beloved by col-
leagues_and students alike.

“Dr. V1/atson was an out-
standingclinician and role model
for our younger faculty and stu-
dents,” Billiarsaid. “Students and
residents were always going to
him for career advice, and not

. just ones from our department-.”.

Last year’s School of _Medi-
cine griiduating class joined with
alumni in dedicating the 1999
graduation “To Dr. Charles

\’Vatson: In appreciation ofyour '

dedication to teaching both the
science and art of medicine to a
generation of physicians.”

‘‘It’s important to convey
what a dominant force Dr.
\’Vatson was in the surgery de-
partment and what a loss his
death represents for us,” Billiar
continued. “I Ie was 63 years old,
but he was still very active.
Clearly, he had not reached the
end of his productivity.”

I At the time of his death,
Watson was vice chairperson for
general surgery anda formervice
chairperson for surgical educa-
tion. In addition to his adminis-

 trative and teaching duties, he
 practifcerd at “Pre'sbyterian Uni‘-'

versity, Montefiore, Shadyside,
Magee—Womens and the Veter-
ans Administration Hospital.
Watson grew up in Rosslyn
Farms and graduated from
Phillips Andover Academy and
Princeton before earning his
medical degree from the Colum-
bia University College ofPhysi-

cians and Surgeons in 1961. Fol-

lowing internships and training
in Cleveland and Boston,
Watson joined Pitt’s surgery
department in 1968.

Isle won numerous honors as
a surgeon and teacher, including
a 1992 Chancellor’s Distin-
guished Teaching Award and
three Golden Apple teacher—of-
the—year awards, -presented by
medical school graduating
classes. ‘ .

Next year, Presbyterian Uni-
versity Hospital plans to open
the Charles G. Watson Center
for Surgical Education.

Watson is survived by his
wife, Nancy; sons Gray of Lex-
ington, Mass., and Andrew of
F,dgewood; a brother, William
of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister,
Aim Kaiser of Charlottesville,
Va.; and one grandson.

UI\IIVERSI‘TV SENATE

  

E R S I Nathan Hershey

IVIATT

The University Senate will be involved with

a number ofmatters in the coming months. My

goal here is to acquaint the University commu-

nity with some ofthem. The order ofsubjects in
no way is intended to indicate their relative
importance. _

At my urging the Senate bylaws and proce-
dures committee is preparing, and soon will
place before the appropriate Senate structures, a

Senate bylaws amendment to permit the removal of Senate

officers. The bylaws document does not now contain such a

provision. My experience in reviewing and drafting gover-

nance documents led me to propose such a bylaws provision.

Unlike some recent bylaws changes, the amendment is a

substantive change and requires a vote by the Senate member-
ship for adoption. . " '

The Senate tenure and academic freedom committee has
expressed approval of a proposal by Arthur Levine, senior vice
chancellor/dean, School ofMedicine, -to extend to 10 years the
period for making tenure decisions for School of Medicine I
clinical faculty.'Thi's is not a new idea. Thomas Detre, Dr.
Levine’s predecessor as senior vice chancellor, on several
occasions urged that such an extension of time for School of
Medicine tenure decisions be made. As this proposed tenure
change undergoes review, one may want to consider: 1. Should
the traditional “time ‘period for faculty in the tenure stream in
other schools ofthe health sciences, and other than School of
Medicine clinical faculty, also be considered for possible exten-
sion now, and 2. Should the tenure time period in the Provost’s
area also be evaluated? In short, is seven years realistic under
present circumstances, particularly since there are numerous
temporary transfers from the tenure stream being granted to
provide additional time for tenure candidates to build the
necessary performance record? ' ,

Other tenure—related thoughts come to mind. Most ofthe
School ofMedicine faculty and, as I understand it, most faculty
in the other healthasc,-iences schools, are not, when hired, placed
in the tenure stream. One may question whether there is a
tenure stream or track in some schools. About half the
Graduate School of Public Health faculty with tenure did not

‘ achieve tenure through the traditional seven-year period cul-
minating in a tenure decision, and I believe the same is true in .
most of the other health sciences schools. CMost faculty in
GSPH, for example, are not-tenured and.never.entered.tl1e.
tenure stream. aNote that the recent incentive plan to encour-
age tenrired faculty to retire was, in part, to provide the
opportunity to hire non-tenure stream faculty to replace retir-
ing tenured faculty. One increasingly wonders about the po-
tential effects on academic freedom, economic security and
protection from arbitrary administrative actions, at an institu-
tion where fewer and fewer faculty are granted tenure.

The Take a Board Member to Class program has been
proceeding at an active pace. On Jan. 7, board members who
had not yet chosen to participate were sent a letter inviting.
them to join the program. I want to encourage faculty who
have not yetjoined the program to make themselves available
for a class sessionor other academic experience with board
members. Reports I have received indicate the board members
who have participated so far appear to be very pleased with the
opportunity the program affords for interaction with faculty.

The next plenary session ofthe Senate will be held at 3 p.m.
Wednesday, March 22. The chancellor willpresent his vision
for the University’s future. Two faculty members will offer
responses to the chancellor’s remarks. One is Jim Holland,"
professor ofpsychology, who has been on the faculty for many
years and is a past-president of the University Senate. The
other isjeanette Trauth, an assistant professor in the Graduate
School ofPublic Health. Professor Trauth is representative of
the younger, energetic faculty who will be most affected by7the
chancellor’s View ofthe future, and responsible for the quality
ofthe University’s performance in the years to come. I encour-
age you to now make a note ofthe date and to plan to attend.-

There is much interest in the "presentation to be made by
Provostjames Maher at thejan. 2 5 Faculty Assembly meeting.
He is to discuss, and to respond to questions concerning, the
content ofthe draft ofthe Uni_~versity’s Information Technol-
ogy Strategic Plan.

Senate committees now are reviewing the draft ofthe plan.
Faculty members who want to review the draft should contact
the Senate office, 624-6505. Faculty members who, after
reviewing the draft, have any comments, should put them in
writing andsend them to the Senate office, 1234 Cathedral of.”
Learning. As everyone surely ‘recognizes, financial resources
will be needed to implement the final plan and the allocation
of costs among the University centrally, the various University
units, and individual faculty members is a key issue.

' Finally, the chancellor and I have established an ad hoc
committee ofadministrators and Senate committee chairper-
sons to look into the status and roles ofliaison persons selected
by the chancellor, who serve as resource persons to _the stand-
ing committees. An incident last fall led to the decision to take
a look at this subject. ' I

ISP, modem connectivity time
will improve.

Pitt will continue to maintain
its current 800 modems, accord-
ing to the plan, but will not in-

- crease thatnumber. “We’re look-

ing into further restricting the
connect time, as well. It’s now
two hours at peak times. Well,
that’s a lot. And some faculty
who need a lot oftime to down-
load huge documents, they can
set their computers to do it [at
off-peak hours],” Pack said.
VVhat the plan makes clear is
that e-mail and web access are
essential tools for faculty, the
vice provost said. “The question
is, what’s fair? As a philosophy,
we’re moving ‘toward heavier
users paying more for it. For
those who are satisﬁed with the
current service, who only use it
to check their e-mail for example,

  that will still be available. For

others, an option of a monthly
fee will be available. Not every-
one working ‘at this University
needs to access the Internet from
home for work purposes.”
According to theinformation
technology plan, each unit will
budget an amount to be used as
the source offunds for computer
hardware and software»acquisi-
tions for tenure and tenure-
stream faculty. The amount bud-
geted will range from $500-$750
per person per year, determined

, by the. discipline and/or. indi-
r vidual needs of the faculty.’ 9'

Pack also said the plan was
designed with an eye toward the
future. “We are not replicating
an old system, but building a
new environment. F aculty_want
to work faster; theyiwant up-
grades in software and hardware.
We have Ethernet, yes; but fac-
ulty want ATM (Asynchronous
Transfer Mode) capability, es-
pecially in engineering, the med
school and information sciences.
ATM is much better for video.
So we took advantage of the
Masonic Temple renovation for
ATM networks. And 50 class-
rooms are now like a ‘video juke-
box’: a video for a class is deliv-
ered automatically at the touch
ofa button from a server.”

Pack said the goal with the
ISP is to be better positioned as
new technology evolves. “We
want to support"it from our end,
but we can’t afford to build it
ourselves. So we want to partner
with businesses whose business
it is to respond to technology
changes. An ISP will add more
capacity as needed, for example.
It’s in their interest.”

Philip Wion, chair of BPC,
said that it appearedthe plan was
establishing the baseline service
for remote access as_ the 800
modems. “But I think it’s fair to
ask where should the baseline

be? If faculty need this, it seems

that to keep the baseline cost-
free, they have to work in their
office. To work off-campus, even
ifit’s the same work, means a fee.
If all 1,600 faculty [subscribed]
at, say, $40 per month, that’s
$700,000-something a‘ year in
cost. Is a compromise possible,
where faculty would pay some,
perhaps, and the University

would pay some [of the monthly
ISP fee]?” Wion asked.

“Again, I think it comes down
to who uses the service and what’s
fair,” Pack replied. “But that is
the kind of question this com-
mittee should put in its written
response to the provost.”

In other Senate budget poli-
cies committee business:

reported that international
phone rates could be coming

“there was a lack of real respon-

Highlights of ” computing plan draft

Some highlights of the draft of “An Information Technology
Foundation for the 21st Century” include:

' The plan provides a framework for further decision making;
a framework that clarifies the responsibilities of the central
University budget to provide the necessaryenvironment for the

the schools and other units to meet the needs oftheir missions,
and the responsibilities ofindividual faculty,”staffand students as
they plan to use University resources in their work.

“Placing the budgetary responsibilities at the correct levels
will allow the best possible decisions and thus optimize the
deployment of resources, but it is recognized that shifting
responsibilities to the unit level from central budgets will require
corresponding budget adjustments as the plan is implemented.”
(From the introduction)

°' All new computer ports will be 10/100 megabytes to

bandwidth. A new cost structure to pay for installation and
maintenance of ports breaks down as follows:

Port installation costs will be reduced from $550 to $306 for
10 megabytes and $400 for 100 megabytes; the current network
access charge ($120 annually per port) will be replaced with an

for 100 MBS. A total of$1.8 million is expected to be generated
from the dialtone charge; it will be used for network infrastruc-
ture and instructional technology. Ports in public areas such as
residence halls, computing labs and the University Library
System will be charged against the Computing and Network
Services fee.  ‘

° A security policy will be defined to govern accessibility to
the Pitt network. ‘

° A centralized software distribution system will be estab_-
lished for faculty. Access to this system will require the acquisi-
tion of one of three recommended computers. There will be no
cost for access to the software for faculty. The distribution
program will be available to staff, but a cost‘ model will be
developed to recover software and proportional server costs.

° The University will centrally fund software used to develop
and access enterprise systems. Oracle has been funded this way.

° Software site licensing services will continue to pursue site
licenses for software that is heavily used throughout the Univer-
Slty. v
° Anew facility will be identified for faculty presenting
research and course materials to colleagues. Campus computing
labs currentlyare used for these purposes. ..

° A faculty instructional development lab, a new facility, will
provide hardware, software and access to technology specialists
to assist faculty with the application of instructional theory,
learning theory, information technology and multimedia tech-

° Current University standards for classroom renovations
call for telephone and network port installation and terminals.
Guidelines and methodologies will be formulated that will allow
portable computer connectivity for faculty in these classrooms.

° University libraries will continue to provide a balance of
traditional research andinstructional materials and an expand-
ing digital library collection. The Endeavor Voyager library
management system will include electronic journal acquisition,
which is a high priority for faculty and students.

° The Help Desk has evolved into a 24—hour—a—day service.
New goals include increasing the staffing and technical expertise
levels and integration with other units__ providing information
technology support. . _

° Development ofthe Expert Partners program, to help units
that hire their own information technology staff, will be contin-
ued. This program provides access to industry support and
training programs and links to other University information
technology resources. _

° A University-wide strategy for use of the web will be
developed, including strategy for e-commerce and web support

for administrative applications. -

Pratt said B__l’;iC‘§had not been
kept up to" date on the negotia-
tions Network Services had with
AT&T. “I’d like to see the pro-
posals made to others than
AT&T, too, and I’d like to see
the rate sheets from AT&'l‘,”
Pratt said.

The committee asked Pratt
to pursue in formation from Net-

work Services officials and pos- ,

sibly invite Ilutchison and
Maurice Gordon, director of
Network Services, to a BPC
meeting to report directly to the
committee. “I'll -make sure it's a

° Wion reported that the
Office of Institutional Research
was ready to generatethe annual
faculty salary reports. He asked
Pack if BPC could request a
change in the report structure to
include salariesofthose whowere
promoted to a higher faculty rank
in the past year.

“To exclude them distorts
actual _inerit raise amounts,”
Wion, said. The number of the
promoted faculty is about 80 of
the 1,600 total faculty members,
or 5 percent, V1/ion said.

Pack said he would consider

therequest, and pass it on_ to the
provost, but cautioned that no
one should take the new figures
as a change in salary award prac-
tice. Pack noted that units differ
in handling promotions in re-
gard to salary increases. “In PAS,
a promotion usually means a 5
percent raise. In other units, it is
not uniform.” ,\’Vion and Pack
also agreed that-faculty on paid
leave or sabbatical, a category
previously not included, should
be counted in the annual salary
reports.

° fVVion also asked ifcatego-
ries in the salary increase report
could take into account a sepa-
rate raise categorv of() percent,

which BPC had i'ecommended_

be awarded to all employees
deemed to fall below satisfactory
'work level. “()ur recommenda-
tion does not carry the force of

law, but we did recommend it. lti

means that the number of fac-
ulty who got raises froin 0.1 per-
cent to just_below the satisfac-
tory level of 1.5 percent is clari-
fied. I just think the more infor-
mation you get, the better.”
Pack said he would pass that
request on to the provost, t‘oo.

Contract extended
for AD Pederson

he University has ex-
tended the contract of
Athletics Director
Steve Pederson, as a reward for

his job performance and to make
. surehe. stays at Pitt. .

Pederson and Pitt senior ad-
ministrators won’t disclose de-
tails of the extension, except to
call it “competitive”in terms of
compensation and duration.

Since his hiring in October
1996, Pederson has led the ath-
letics department through mo-
mentous times, including deci-
sions to:

°. Demolish Pitt Stadium and
move home football games to
Three Rivers Stadium next sea-
son, and to the Steelers’ new
stadium on the North Side in
2()()l. _

° Move Pitt’s basketball teams
into the new, $70 million john
M. and Gertrude Ii. Petersen
convocation center,’possibly by
January 2()()2.

° Hire coaches Walt llarris
(football), Ben llowland (men’s
basketball) and Traci Waites
(women’s basketball).

tuting an annual $1,000 per seat
fee for premium seats in

Fitzgerald Field Ilouse; negoti— -

ate deals to increase sales of Pitt
merchandise and apparel featur-
ing the University teams’ new

Those (and other) moves have
not been universallypopularwith
Panthers fans, especially the Pitt
Stadium demolition. But
Pederson enjoys the support of
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
Pitt trustees and many Univer-
sity students and employees.

“Steve’s performance has re-
ally exceeded my expectations,”
Chancellor Nordenberg said, in
a written statement. “He has dis-

played an amazingly high level

of energy, creativity and com-
mitment, right from his first day
at the University, and his pace
has never diminished.

ful new coaches and positioned
us to have the best new athletic
facilitiesin the country. He has
been a real force for improve-
ment and excellence, and 1 am
confident that the University will
continue to benefit from his com-
mitment.”

Pederson, also in a written
statement, said: “VVe’re pleased
that the chancellor is happy with
the direction ofour athletic pro-
gram and wants us to continue
the work that we have started.”

Susan Albrecht, an associate
professor of nursing who chairs
the University Senate athletics
committee, called Pederson’s
contract extension “absolutely
wonderful news.”

Committee members “spoke
very'positively” ofthe extension
at theirjan. l 3 meeting, Albrecht
said.‘

Albrecht maintained that
“Steve has re-energized and re-

focused the athletics depart-

ment” by helping to improve
playing and training facilities,
hiring outstanding coaches, and
increasing visibility for Pitt ath-
letics.

Whether or not you like the
new, darker blue-and—gold col-
ors and “Pittsliurgh” logo, “you
see a lot more ofthe new colors
and the new logo than you did,

the old blue—and_-l)right—yellowg

colors and the old ‘Pitt’ script,”
Albrecht said.
Better still, she added,

Pederson is “totally committed”

to winning within Pitt and
NCAA academic standards.
“There’s no waveringin his dedi-
cation to academics,” Albrecht
said.

Common Pleas

gal briefs filed with Gallo’s of-I

fice. . _

According to Henson’s side,
Common Pleas Court lacks ju-
risdiction in the case because Pitt
already has “adequate remedy”
under the law: It can exhaust the
city -or'dinance’s administrative
process and appeal any HRC
decision that goes againstthe
University. ‘

Also, Henson’s lawyers write
in their brief,’ P'it”t‘li‘a’s‘féii’l‘e'd“to
demonstrate that continuation

of the HRC proceedings threat-

ens the University with “irrepa-
rable harm.” Such a threat is
required to obtain _a preliminary
injunction. -

Pitt lawyers have argued that
continued HRC proceedings will
force the University to waste
money in defending against a
case “with no legal basis,” and
that such proceedings will “dis-
rupt and distract the time and
energy” of University officials
and trustees. '

. But, Henson’s side writes: “As
a matter of law, the expense and
inconvenience of defending a
lawsuit do not amount to irrepa-
rable harm.”

IfCommon Pleas Court sus-
tains Pitt’s motion, Henson’s
lawyers say, it would open the
doors for other “dissatisfied de--
fendants” to use the court in
bypassing agency and municipal
law. 1

Pitt’s briefcitcs a number of
‘cases in which Pennsylvania ap-
pellate courts “have not been
reluctant to issue injunctions

' enjoining administrative agen-

cies_[such as the HRC] from fur-
ther proceeding in cases where
they have exceeded or abused
their power or authority.” Uni-
versity attorneys write: “Defen-
dants’ assertion that the grant of
such reliefin this case will ‘open

the floodgates’ to similar requests.

ings before the Commission — I

to begin with — is refuted by

up venture founded by Cadu-
ceus Capital Health -Ventures.
Caduceus is a for-profit, Bos-
ton-based group that funds bio-

year, UPMC announced that it

Herberman said the TCM

"Center is recruiting a director

and plans to submit, within‘ the
next two months‘, a proposal for
the center to be named ‘a re-

no specialized expertise” of the
city HRC, according to Univer-
sity attorneys. I
Pitt maintains that Henson’s
claim under the city anti-dis-
crimination ordinance is “based
upon a fundamentally erroneous
premise, i.e/., that same-sex do-
mestic partners‘ of homosexual
employees are equatable with
spouses of heterosexual employ-
ees.” In truth, “the appropriate
comparison is between domestic
partners of homosexual and het-
erosexual employees,” according
to the University.
’ Lawyers for Henson’s side
argue that the city ordinance does
not require that employers pro-
vide health insurance or any other
specific benefit to same-sex part-
ners. Rather, the ordinance for-
bids discrimination in offering
such benefits‘. “The fact that a
law requires equal treatment does
not mean’ that anyone is required
to do anything; it requires only
that zfthey act, they do so in a
non—discriminatory manner,” the
Henson side’s brief states.
According to the Henson side,
Pitt has two legal options under
the city ordinance: It can offer

health benefits equally to het— '

erosexual spouses and same-sex
domestic partners (who, under
state law, can’t legally marry) or
the University can do away with

. health benefits entirely. What
— Pitt am’t legallysdo, under the

city ordinance, is provide un-
equal beneﬁts that discriminate
against homosexuals, according
to Henson’s attorneys. They say
their lawsuit is seeking to force
the University to eliminate dis-
crimination, not necessarily to
extend health benefits to same-
sexpartners.

Pitt’s briefdismisses that ar-
gument as “utter nonsense” that
is belied by the complainants’
claims. “Each ofthe seven com-
plaints in the Henson case al-
leges that the complainant has
been denied such benefits not-
withstanding that they are pro-
vided to the spouses of hetero-
sexual employees, and that such
denial violates the ordinance in

question,” the brief states. “Thus, ‘

And under last November’s
state‘ l_egislation, state-related
universities such as Pitt are ex-
empt from providing those ben-
efits to same-sex partners, the
Pitt brief argues.

The legisla_tion reads in part:
“An ordinance adopted by a mu-
nicipality which requires, for the

praised Pittsburgh’s biomedical
and pharmaceutical strengths.
They said researchers at Chi-
nese institutions will exchange
research findings with colleagues

Herberman said he was ex-
cited to hear Chinese officials

_say that TCM herbal mixtures

tend to work not by attacking
cancer cells or infectious diseases
per se, but by stimulating the
body’s natural processes,’ particu-
larly the immune system.

“I’m an immunologist my-
self,”‘he said, “and that is one of
the major res_earch strengths of
UPCI [the University of Pitts-
burgh Cancer In'stitute].” ’_

TCM center researchers
haven’t decided yet which herbal
mixtures to test first, said
Herberman, who cited confiden-
tiality considerations in declin-
ing to name the substances.

He did allow that they in-
clude ginseng and “various root
plants” — most of which,
Herberman said, he’d never
heard of before this week.

“Based on information from

the Chinese govern_ment,” he

added,’“I can say that some of
the more promising mixtures
show signs of being useful in
treating. lung and liver cancer
and limiting the spread of vari-
ous gastro-intestinal cancers to
the liver.”

It would be “absolutely won-
derful” to find cancer cures
through TCM, but researchers
here would be happy just to de-
velop new drugs to treat symp-

toms and alleviate patients’ suf-

fering, Herbérman said.

in treating epilepsy.” .
In gaining FDA approval for
testing TCM—based drugs in

humans, toxicity may not be a

majorhurdle, Herberman said.

“That’s because the Chinese, tra-
ditionally, have followed an en-
tirely different sequence _of re-
search and discovery” in testing
drugs, he explained. '
“The American or Western
approach is to do some screen-
ing in the laboratory, then in
animals, and then I in patients.
The Chinese approach has been
exactly the opposite. They have

taken these herbal mixtures or

recipes and tried them, first in
people, and they have been do-
ing so by trial and error «over
thousands ofyears,” Herberman
said. “Through this very long
experience, they at least know
what is safe and what can be
tolerated in people.”

— It’s only been in the last few
years that Western scientists have
taken T CM seriously, Herber-
man noted. “I think a lot ofit has

been related to not very good ‘
-communication between the

Chi-nese and colleagues in the
United States. There’s also been
a negative prejudice that needed
to be overcome here in the West.

“In our drug design, we tend
to go for defining a single chemi-
cal molecule [useful in treating
illness] and then taking that into
clinical studies, whereas the Chi-
nese have done it in the opposite
direction by prescribing unde-
fined mixtures ofherbs.”

Detre rejected a common
Western criticism ofTCM: that
Chinese physicians often pre-
scribe a single plant mixture for

selfa plant-based drug) likewise
has been used successfully by
Western doctors to treat various
conditions: pain, diarrhea, even
depression, Detre said.

JANUARY 20, 2000 ,

Three weeks into what has
been trumpeted as the Asian
Century, U.S. high schools and
middle schools still tend to teach
history, geography, economics
and world culture from a West-
ern point of view, many educa-
tors agree.

To help swing pre-college
curricula in a more easterly di-
rection, Pitt’s Asian studies pro-
gram is joining with the Allegh-

eny Intermediate Unit (AIU) to .

offer an eight-week seminar,
“East Asia: Yesterday and To-
day,” for local teachers.

The Pitt~AIU seminar is one
of 50 across the country being
funded this year by The,Free—
man Foundation. The family-
based charity specializes in sup-
porting educational programs to
increase understanding ofChina
and other Asian nations.

From Feb. 26 through May

13, some 20 teachers will meet in‘

Pitt’s Posvar Hall and an AIU
Downtown classroom to study
Asian history, philosophy, litera-
ture and politics.

After the seminar, teachers
will be expected to submit plans
for implementing Asian compo-
nents in courses at their schools.
Teachers will each receive $1,000
for their own books as well as
teaching materials for their
schools. For extra fees, partici-
pants can earn three graduate

credits from Pitt’s education.

Asian studies/AIU   seminar
targets pre-college teachers

school plus AIU in—service cred-
its.

Diane M. Wood, associate
director ofthe Asian studies pro-
gram, said school curricula in
Pennsylvania tend to focus dis-
proportionately on the United
States and Europe.

“There are pockets in our
school systems where teachers
are working very hard to deal
with non—Western parts of the
world,” she allowed. “But in the
typical world cultures course
that’s taught in Pennsylvania at
around the 10th grade level,
maybe three-quarters of the time
will be devoted to the West and

only one-quarter to Eastern .

countries.
“I think that's partly because

' teachers don’t feel comfortable

teaching about Asia. They don’t
feel knowledgeable about that
part ofthe world.” i

It is projected that, by the
year 202 5, China’s middle class
will outnumber theentire U.S.
population; that, by 2050, Asia
will account for more than half
of the world’s population, 40
percent of the global economy
and more than halfofthe world’s
information technology indus-
try. A
“These are realities that we
have to come to terms with in
the classroom, and not bury our
heads in the sand,” Woodsaid.
