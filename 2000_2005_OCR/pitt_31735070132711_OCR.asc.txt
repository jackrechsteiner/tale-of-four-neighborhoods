_ Staff Writer
Local outdoor adventurers ambled into the

Byham Theater Wednesday evening to witness a

stop on the Banff Mountain Film Festival World
Tour. ‘

_ The audience collectively ooh-ed and ahh-ed j

as shots of extreme sports, extreme conditions,
exotic lands and ‘endangered animals ﬂashed on
the big screen. A ‘ '
Mike Schiller, executive director of the
Western Pennsylvania Field Institute, opened the

evening by telling the l,300—person audience that

the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which helped WPFI
get the Byham Theater for the show, was initially
“amused by the suggestion that the film festival

Vwould sell out the house.”

“In fact, [we sold out the house,” Schiller said,
as the audience‘ applauded. .

WPFI, which announced its name change to
Venture Outdoors the same night, is, a member-
supported, non-profit organization that runs more
than 500 outdoor activities in.a given year, Schiller
said. Their mission is to “get people outside.”

“The world will be a better place when people
spend more time outside,” he added.

Schiller went on to thank the local sponsors
and the Banff Mountain Film Festival for their
help. V ’

“It took uslthree years to convince the [tour] to
come to Pittsburgh,” he explained. This is the sec-
ond year the festival has come to Pittsburgh, and
looking out at the sold-out crowd, Schiller

I ‘announced, “I think they’ll be coming back.”

This is -the 28th year of the festival, which is
held every ' year duringrthe 5 first weekend of
November, in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The festival
is an intemational film competition, and this year,
the organizers received more than 300 films, from
ﬁlmmakers, ranging from a 15-year-old amateur to
National Geographic professionals, representing
34 countries. ‘ I -

For some seniors, the count-
down has begun. For others, there

_ never was a countdown.
H But, ready or not, graduation

day is approaching, and for most,»

the reality of this hit hard on
Tuesday -or Wednesday‘ at
Graduation Central.

-“I know it’s official now. I have '

my cap and gown,” senior Michael
_, McCabe said.

According to MJ Lovett — the
adviser for the Blue and Gold
Society, the student branch of Pitt’s
Alumni Association — Graduation

- Central _ is “a. one-stop shopping

a

event for all of your graduation
needs.” -

- The first stop: several measure-
ment tables, at which students were
personally sized to ensure the per-

. fect fit of their caps and gowns.

From here, students followed the
panther tracks lining theﬂoor and
-leading the way to a succession of
different tables and stands in the
Alumni Hall Ballroom. ~.

With “The Electric Slide” play-

ing in the background, the room —"

adorned with bundles of ’ blue and
. yellow balloons — buzzed with
excitement as seniors ‘wandered
from tableto table, receiving infor-
* mation and free gifts such as key
chains, beach towels, Panther bob-

ble heads, candy and more.

Cecelia Frerotte, a senior

. majoring in Accounting, appreciat--

ed the organization of this event.
“I especially liked the setup of

I different booths. They all provided

useful information students need
before and after graduation,” she
said.

The Alumni Association,
Liberty , utual and Career
Services set up booths to assist stu-
dents. The athletics department
offered seniors an early opportuni-
ty to purchase Panther football

Staff Writer

Given one guess, which of the following has

» not been used as birth control in the past: gun-

powder mixed with camel foam, alcohol-brewed
with dried beaver testicles, or the element mer-
cury? ‘ '
“Actually, they were all used before — none
of which were effective,” explained Dr. Laura
Berman, sex therapist and correspondent for
ABC-TV’s “Good Morning America.”

This is how Berman opened her presentation
Wednesday evening at Magee-Women’s hospital.
The presentation focused on the impact of con-
traceptive options, and how they are re-shaping
women’s lives.

Berman discussed the different types of con-
traceptive options available to women today.
Some of these options include “the pill,” “the

patch,” “the ring,” SEASONALE, and intrauter-

ine devices, or IUDs. . V‘
According to Berman, 80 percent“ of all
women have been on the Pill, but this is mainly
because they simply take what the doctor offers.
' But Berman and Dr. Amita Murthy, the clini-
cal instructor in the department of obstetrics and
gynecology at Pitt’s Medical School, want
women to be aware of the many other options,

aside from the pill, that are available to them.

‘ “It’s the dawn of a new era in women’s
health, with important new developments hap-
pening almost daily,” said Murthy, who spoke
before Berman. '

Berman and Murthy discussed SEA-
SONALE,: the latest in new contraceptive
options for women, which reduces a woman’s

ond baby in June, stood behind the podium, she
informed her audience of the possibility that

women will have no periodsin the future.
“In 1960, the pill was actually designed to

eliminate periods, but doctors thought this would '

freak women out too much,” Berman said.

Women‘ also frequently ask whether the pill
affects fer/tility, once women stop taking it,
Berman said.

“No,” she replied, answering her own ques-
tion. “‘In fact, some studies indicate it might
actually enhance fertility.” ~

Murthy. informed the audience that the aver-
age American woman wants to have two chil-
dren, to complete her idea of the perfect family.

“This means that most women spend about
three decades trying to avoid pregnancy,”
Murthy said. . ‘

About 49 percent of pregnancies are unwant-
ed or mistimed, Murthy said, going onto suggest

that using any contraceptive method is better .

than using none at all.
Women attending the forum received signed

ter, Dr.‘ Jennifer Berman.

THE PITT 

Brothers give out more than $1,000
  in a purple—and—gold-painted house

NIKKI SCHWAB
Senior Staff Writer

The Omega ‘Psi Phi brothers gave
away more than $1,000 in scholar-
ships to six area college students at a
ceremony Wednesday night. ‘

The event took place in East-

Liberty, in the graduate chapter’s fra-
ternity house. While no brothers
reside in the house, it is used for
meetings and other events, and is
painted in Omega Psi Phi’s colors,
purple and gold. .‘
The undergraduate event began
with a brief history of the fraternity.
National Pan-Hellenic Council
President and Omega Psi Phi brother
Ron Coursey stepped up to the podi-
um and discussed the difficult job
market.
-‘‘It’s “scary, you .guys, these
days,” he said. “Even with a college

degree, it’s difficult and challeng-

1ng. . ,
Coursey explained that many
people "believed that his fraternity
was only about partying and stepping
— creating rhythms using your body
-—— but giving away‘ scholarships
showed that this was not the case.

, “We play hard, and we work hard
too,” Coursey said. “We’re all busi-

ness Monday through Friday.” _
‘ Brothers then took turns explain-

ing the importance of each of—their
“four cardinal principles,” which are
manhood, scholarship, perseverance
and uplift.

_ State Rep. Jake‘ Wheatley, D—.
District 19, acted as keynote speaker
of_,the evening. Wheatley is an-

Omega Psi Phi brother and member
of the graduate chapter.

“I struggled in life 4 some
mighty, mighty struggles,” said

_ Wheatley, originally of Detroit. The‘

32-year-old representative ~told the
small.audience that he had a felony

» on his record for “strong-armed rob-

bery,” and, “by fate,” a judge had
given him the opportunity to attend

college rather then serve time in

prison. A
Wheatley persevered and attend-
ed college in North Carolina and’

_ then came to Pitt for graduate school.

He ran for office in 2002 and now

represents the Hill District and parts

of Oakland. ' -
While facing -many barriers,

~Wheatley became an elected official,

and he encouraged the audience to
believe‘ that they can overcome
obstacles “no matter what the chal-
lenge.” _ «
‘»‘You have tomake that determi-
nation that you are as good as any-
body else,” Wheatley said. “They are
only human beings.” . 0

Wheatley also discussed how
important it is to give back to the
community. V

“You are receiving today,. but
tomorrow, maybe you will be giv-
ing,” Wheatley said to the scholar-
ship winners, 0

At this time, five of the scholar-
ship recipients were presented with
their checks. 7

“I -intend to persevere, keep
going strong,”-David Temple, a
junior mathematics and’ business

major at Pitt, said as he was given ‘

his $200.

Film, page 1

Wednesday night’s presentation
began with a film called, “Focused:
Shane McConkey.” The film showed
McConkey, an extreme skier, going
down huge, powder-covered moun-
tains on water skis while being chased
by avalanches and doing back ﬂips.
McConkey then chucked his ski poles
into the air, skied right off an enor-
mous cliff, and freefell for a while,
before throwing His parachute behind
him.

“Wehyakin,” involved a group of"

Norway, and kayak-surfing the Pacific

Next, the festival’s winner for best

climbing film, “Eiger North Face — In’

the Footsteps‘of Its First Climbers,”
showed two accomplished moun-
taineers climb Eiger, a mountain in”the
Swiss Alps.

Except these men did the climb‘
with the same type of equipment as the
pioneer ascenders used 64 years ago.
The men wanted to prove that “the
feats of today are nothing” compared

sports an

to things accomplished back then.
After ‘intermission, the film
“Rockstars — One, Steep Planet,” pre-
sented, a variety of wild stunts, like
biking down snow—covered ski trails
and cliff jumping, in the Swiss Alps.
The film, “Cost of Freedom,”
evoked the most -tears and -horrified

‘ looks of the night, as it presented both

sides of a controversial wolf reintro-
duction effort in Idaho. The insensitiv-
ity of both livestock owners, who were
against the reintroduction, and the
wolf recovery personnel shocked
many audience members. A

Next, the film “Janica Kostelic”

 

presented the perseverance and love
for skiing of Kostelic and her family
through hard times in Croatia.
Kostelic recovered from two knee
surgeries to take home three gold

her the first woman in history to take

Sanctioning for size of NPHC frats harmful, grad member says

Omega, page 3

Yancey received her check and thanked the broth-
ers. '

“Books aren’t cheap, so this will come in
handy,” she said._ A '

Other scholarship award winners in attendance
were, Pitt freshmen Adaobi Ezedinma and Teya
Calbert as well as junior Courtney Jarmon.

After presenting the checks, the brothers and
award recipients feasted on Subway subs, chicken
wings and a variety of deserts. .

Omega Psi» Phi Fraternity Inc., is one of the
seven organizations belonging to NPHC, the gov-
ernance group that oversees the historically black
fraternities and sororities. _

The recent University decision for NPHC

organizations to increase in membership had some
graduate chapter members worried. The
University wants each fraternity and sorority to
have five members by fall and possibly 10 mem-
bers by spring.

Graduate chapter Basileus Keith Clark,
explained that the University sanctioning is harm-
ful because of the short time frame the fraternity
has for compliance.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sad affair,” Clark said.
“We still believe that the black Greek organiza-
tions need to be ’on the University of Pittsburgh
[campus] for social and economic reasons.”

Clark was confident, however, that Omega Psi
Phi members at Pitt would persevere. .

“We’re going’ to do everything humanly possi-
ble to make that happen,” he said.

Wheatley also voiced his concerns, but added
that he thought highly of the administration.

“Dr. [Jack] Daniel is a wonderful ‘administra-
tor,” he said.

Wheatley added that the administration want-
ed to do what is best for the students but must find
a way to do that without eliminating NPHC frater-
nities and sororities.

‘He said the University should support the
“highly selective” process in which it takes to gain
membership to an NPHC organization.

Omega Psi Phi has a current membership of
six, with two members, including Coursey, gradu-
ating this spring.

This event was the first of its kind for Omega
Psi Phi, but the brothers plan to continue provid-

ing scholarships for the community. _

EDITORIAL

Finals week really a finals fortnight

Finals week: (n.) The period of
time in which students are given their
last exams of the semester.

At Pitt, this process goes on for
two weeks. Over the years, the tradi-
tional seven days set aside for testing
has become a finals fortnight, forcing
students to take and study for exami-
nations in the same time period.

Pitt’s calendar gives us a chance to
start summer vacation before most

other universities. We can bask in the"

warm sunshine and get some rest -
things we have missed for the two
weeks prior to the end of the second
semester because of the ambiguous
finals schedule for most arts and sci-
ences classes. ,

Why have finals week if there are
finals given before that time?

When one or two professors want
to have more time to grade exams and
papers, it is a relief to the student who
gets one thing out of the way before
being bombarded with other exams.
B_ut when almost every professor
starts moving final exams to the week
before finals week, we have a prob-
lem. _

Universities like Temple and the
University of Pennsylvania give their
students reading days — days where
students are expected to study because
classes aren’t in session, and tests
aren’t scheduled — in preparation for

finals week.

At Pitt, not only are we”denied
these days to prepare, but also we
have to recall an ‘entire semester’s
worth of information in less than a
week, which can count for up to 50
percent of our final grade. '

Be reasonable, Pitt.

We want to be good students and
do well in our classes. We just need
time to prepare.

How prepared can we be when we
are not getting enough sleep and expe-
riencing crunch-time jitters? I . .

Being tested physically, mentally
and emotionally is unfair and extreme-
ly stressful. Continuing to do this
demonstrates a major lack of foresight
— read: stupidity —— and resembles a
two-week hazing rather than a test of
knowledge acquired. '

There are those who have the
strengthfor such a process-

There- should be the option to
forego days of study for those few and
brave students to take an early final,-
but for the rest of us, a ﬁnal during
finals week is not too much to ask for.

Rather than the all too familiar
binge-and-purge method of learning
that occurs when finals are adminis-
tered before finals week, we would
have enough time to digest the infor-
mation.

Doesn’t that sound healthier?

The best: the choice of this generation

Perhaps it was The Who’s inﬂuence, or
perhaps I just read too many Google News
articles about the 18-to-24-year-old demo-
graphic, but whatever it was, I started think-
ing about my generation. We’ ve been called
a lot of things: media-savvy, ignorant, ideal-
istic, jaded, industrious; we’ve even been
called slackers, as if our predecessor,
Generation X, didn’t ride one of the biggest
economic booms ever.

Mostly, we’ve just
been called leaderless. We
are a generation lacking a
uniﬁed voice, but more
importantly, we are a gen-
eration lacking someone
(or some cause) around
which to rally, and then
speak. Usually, when we‘

Perhaps the problem with picking the
lesser of two evils isthat this “lesser” evil
proved to be, in fact,’rather conniving. And
now, again, we are picking the lesser of two
evils, Keny instead of Bush, and thereby not
getting what we want. But Kerry, who has
the credibility to take a stand on such issues,
needs to get oif the fence and speak out on
Iraq, just ashe has on the economy. Former
presidential candidate Howard
Dean may not be the best~exam-
ple to follow, but Kerry should
think about taking a page from
his book At least Dean had the
hubris to say what he meant.
« Instead, some of us are
stuck picking again, not who we
want, but, rather, not who we
don’t want, because Kerry
won’t take a ﬁrm stand.
Sure, I’m happy every

John Kermedy quote about
 not what our coun-
try can do for us, as if Kennedy’-s intent was-
n’t to galvanize a generation, but rather to
silence dissent. And for all that we, as col-
lege students, as_vAmericans, are doing for
our country f— getting an education, voting,
questioning, collating mass-mailings for
presidential candidates — it’s time to start
asking what our country can do for us.

With the Democratic Party’s future
presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry, D-
Mass., here today, gracing Bigelow
Boulevard, this seems like a good"stat1J'ng
point Our - generation has, too often, been
forced to choose the lesser of two evils.

‘ During the 20()O election, most felt that there

was really no true diﬂerence between the
candidates, and picked the most palatable
candidate, not necessarily the one they sup-
ported, but the one they (and I say they and
not we, because I was too young to vote)
thought would be the most innocuous.

Given a list of compromisers — compas-

sionate conservatives, centrist liberals —
they checked the box that they disagreed
with the least. _

V And they got Bush, who is by no means
a centrist or “a uniter not a divider.”

I paycheck Getting whatl want, out of poli-

tics at least, sounds like youthful optimism,
soon to be crushed by the ominous “real \
world,” if such a thing exists. But isn’t
youthﬁrl optimism the privilege of youth?
The fact is that we, as a generation, want
many things, among the least of which is, for
example, an affordable education. I pick this
topic because it’s already become an issue.

.During a visit to the University of Rhode

Island, Kerry stated his support for Various
tuition assistance programs, including
exchanging public service for tuition aid,
according to the University of Connecticut’s

student newspaper, The Daily Campus.

Perhaps this is just a tactic to win our votes.
Cynicisme aside, though candidates should
expect such cynicism —— we’re smart con-
sumers, in addition to being media-savvy —
it’s one that will work Too many ofus are

Kerry must be more than not Bush to Win

Everybody knows today’s big news: Jon
Bon Jovi (“on a steel horse he rides”) is here.
Though he’s wanted —-- wanted — dead or
alive, he pronrises to evade the law long
enough to rock your face with his band, The
Jon Bon Joviality Project.

With all the ballyhoo surrounding J.B.J.,
it’s easy to miss another visitor to our ﬁne carn-
pus: Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who sources
tell me is running for president. Kerry has
snuck in under the radar, like Springsteen used
to, barely advertising his visit. He’ll take the
stage today for a blistering set of favorites like,
“It is essential that we have a process in place

Bush administration slowly bleed approval
points without getting his hands dirty. Instead,
he’s focused on the economy, the huge deﬁcit
President Bush has run up, and tax cuts that
beneﬁt the rich (including Messrs. Bush and
Cheney). There’s a gathering charge in the air,
as though it might soon be third-rail time. Yet,
when I asked my ﬁiend what he thought about
Kerry, he replied, “Well, he can’t be any worse
than Bush.” Indeed. And it sounds as though, if
Keny is in need of a slogan, he might consider,
“John Kerry: The Lesser of Two Evils.” This is

. the problem with rrmning a campaign solely to

beat the other guy, as many on the left want

that actually empowers the Iraqi
people and legitimizes the trans-
formation of Iraq to that stabili-
ty,” and his now-classic cover of
MC5’s “Kick Out the Jams.”
Okay, he’s here and he’s
ready to rock for liberty. But who
is Kerry? This is the man
Democrats and Descartes-read-

 

Kerry to do. Voters have two choices;
Bush, and Anti—Bush. That works for
voters already rabid about overthrow-
ing King George, but it won’t bring in
those who normally don’t vote. “He
can’t be any worse than Bush” is not
a galvanizing slogan. '

It might sound as though I
don’t like John Kerry. Tobe honest,

ing liberals are pinning their
November hopes on. Does he
live up to the hype? The answer
is, of course, “it depends.” It
depends on what you think this election is
about. One thing it’s about, for many on the
left, is beating George W. Bush. Who can send
the Cowboy back to his hobby ranch? The
chant of “electability, electability,” is spoken in
quasi-mystical tones as, beginning with the
Iowa primaries, Democrats divined that Kerry
has the best chance of defeating the president.
They’re probably right — Kerry has lost only
one election in his career, when a member of
Nixon’s' dirty tricks crew sabotaged Kerry’s
ﬁrst run at Congress. After that loss, in which
his opponent tried to turn Kerry’s service in
Vietnam against him, Kerry left politics to
complete ‘law school and become a district
attomey. Ten years later, the political bug
struck again, and Kerry ran for lieutenant gov-
ernor. He won, and has been winning ever
since, despite the endless repetition of the same
old charges. He has a knack for winning, an
innate ability to recognize where and when to
make the decisive move. His former media
adviser, Dan Payne, calls these moments
“third-rail time” — referring to the electriﬁed

third rail of a subway; Kerry’s third-rail moves ‘

leave opponents shocked and smoking.

The back-story gives hope to those who
want Bush gone. For tlrerrr, the coming election
is about winning, and Kerry is a proven winner.
He’s refused to criticize the situation in Iraq
except in the most general terrrrs, letting the

Young voters should be asking what Kerry, and our country, can do for them  

But before I give up my bubbly, youthful
optimism, here’s one last plea: John Kerry,
‘it’s time not to ask what we can do for you,
but for you to ask yourself what you can do
for our country. '

most of his campaign has left me less

the whole “gravitas” argument -——if
it’s so crucial that a president have
gravitas, how do you explain the current CEO-
in-Chief? Don’t quote me on this, but I think
Bush would read “gravitas” with a Spanish
accent and wonder why no one is impressed.
But after doing more research, digging
below Kerry’s managed persona, I think he’s a
pretty good guy. As a prosecutor, he put mob-
sters behind bars; in Congress he opened the
probe that revealed Panamanian dictator
Manuel Noriega’s connection to the Reagan-
sponsored contras. He investigated the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International money-
laundering ring, which got him in hot water
with Democrats whose friends got caught in
the dragnet. In the past he’s had the support of
Kurt Vonnegut and John McCain, and that’s
good enough for me. John Kerry is fond of
resisting labels —— I hope in this campaign he’ll
resist the “Anti-Bush” label and deﬁne himself
as something more of a winner. Because in this
election, I want something more than themore
popular of two mediocrities; I — and the half
of Americans who don’t vote — don’t want
another human advertisement; we want some-
one who’ll bring substance and complexity
back to politics.
And that will make victory all the sweeter.

Kerry needs McCain to win in Nov.

Now that the 2004 election battles
are in full swing, we’ve been inundated
with television ads. Here are a two that
won’t air but should, and a last one that I
hope will.

“I’m Kim Jong ll, and I endorse this

The camera focuses on Kinr Jong 11.

Paid for by fgreign leaders Jason Lawrence
for Kerry’ Columnist

“I am Prince Bandar -
bin Sultan and I approved

this ad.” Cue images of the Bush family
and Saudi leaders on the Bush family
ranch. “President Bush has prosecuted

» the war on terror with remarkable force,

but is unwilling to do the one additional
thing to winit; weaken the oil economy.
It is no secret that Saudi oil wealth funds
terrorism.”

“'Ihe United States, with its econo-
my and research capabilities, a could
invent marketable alternatives to oil that
would markedly decrease the world
demand for oil and cripple our ability to
fund terrorism -— er, our economy.
Because President Bush is beholden to
oil interests in the United States, I
endorse his bid for the presidency.” This
ad paid for by oil autocrats for Bush.

Kerry’s foreign policy, as arriculat-_

ed, has our military playing too small a
role in ﬁghting terrorism. Bush, being
unable to distance himself from oil,
leaves himself unlikely to win the socioe-
cononric components of the war on ter-
rorism. We need a president and a vice
president —— like John McCain —- who
willwinthewaronterrorismbotlrmili-

I am John McCain,” (in unison) “and We
believe that an America at war requires a

united, not divided government. We
endorse this message of unity.”

Cue Kerry.‘ “Since September 1-1,
2001, we have been a nation at war, and
we will continue to  a nation at war
until citizens from Los Angeles to New
York, from London to Madrid, from
Istanbul to Manila, and everywhere in
between are safe from terrorism.”

“However, there is more to ﬁghting-
a war than the use of force. Part of war is

the sacriﬁce every citizen makes.
Both parties must do what

President Bush has,’ not,
and ask every American,
wealthy and not, to sac-
riﬁce for this war effort.
Companies‘ and CEOs
must_be willing to give up their
riches gained from tax-cuts so
that America may fund what
Middle East expert Thomas
Friedman terms ‘a second
Manhattan Project’ of ‘developing
a cheaper energy alternative to
oil. This is the only way to ‘truly
choke ‘off the oil money that
funds Al-Qaida and other terrorists.”
. Cue McCain. “Working class citi-
zens must also understand that the
‘export’ of blue-collar and service jobs to
nations around the world, no matter how
unpleasant in the short-ternr, improves
the quality of life in the developing
world. Economic gowth and the stabili-
ty it brings will give us more allies in the
war on terrorism In the long run, it also
means cheaper goods and services here.
Unions and those who are,committed to‘
‘protecting the jobs we have now’ must
sacriﬁce their vision of ‘an American
economy built on manufacturing and
simple service jobs, and embrace a ﬂuid
economy where education, creativity,

V and adaptability are the most prized char-

acteristics.” Cue Kerry and McCain in
unison.‘ “We are here to tell the powerful
interests on both sides of the aisle, those
representing big business, and  rep-
resenting the ‘little guy,’ that they must

“The Bachelor” just isn’t the same

“The Bachelor” was my island in an ocean of Why do we have to complicate a benign con-

reality show sea scum. It was nothing like its
awful and gimmicky spin-off shows

cept? _
Now we’ve got a situation where-

“Joe Millionaire” or “Average Joe,”
both of which play on some sick
public desire to witness, deceit,
manipulation and humiliation.
Besides the usual criticisms that
it makes-dating a competition and it
forces a guy to pick ‘a woman from
a chosen few, “The Bachelor”
seemed straightforward and benevo-
lent enough to hook even a staunch
reality-show hater. Yeah, sure, it all
takes place in TV land paradise —
where you have a live-in makeup
artist, ‘and every’ date is expensive,
well-planned and captured in cine-

 

Amatographic -excel1ence_,— but at-

the root, it felt like watching people just like us
searching for that special someone."

Then ABC raised the sea level. .

This season of “The Bachelor” is so ﬂooded
with ﬂashy ratings maneuvers that I might have

to abandon Wednesday girlslnights just to keep ‘

my head above water.

I mean, Jesse, Palmer? Is thisnecessary? Isn’t
if pretty obvious that this guy is going to have,
and has had, plenty of , opportunities to meet
women? This show used to be about finding
love, not getting rich and famous. Shouldn’t you
just watch, “American Idol” if that’s your thing?

in women who may not be completely
interested in the bachelor’s personality
turn into gold-diggers in hot pursuit for
all the wrong reasons. I’m not making
this up, it’s already happening with at
least onewoman on the show. ‘
It must not be entertaining
enough to have eligible guys like Aaron
Buerge or “bachelorettes" like Trista
Rehn on the menu — being a good-
looking, intelligent, financially stable
* professional just doesn’t cut it anymore.
The public demands a nationally recog-
nized millionaire sports figure to con-
‘fuse women with press, sports prowess
and the promise of loving her as long as
he doesn’t ha-vea game. We need special twists
that add unnecessary pressure and complications
to an already emotionally complex situation.
And now there’s a spy. She pretends to be
one of the women vying for J esse’s heart, though

  

‘she’s really his best friend, whispering back to
him all the dirty information she digs up when
’ he’s not around. It’s a good thing ABC didn’t let

us know who she was at first; blurring her face

and changing hervoice created a lot of nail-bit- _,

ing ‘suspense the first night. The fact that there
was only one woman wearing more than a size
three didn’t give it away at all.

Why didn’t they think of this sooner? Now I
can enjoy all the suspense of wondering if Jesse
will take his spy’s advice, if the other girls will
figure it out, or if Jesse won’t offer her a rose the
next time, so he can go at it alone. The possibil-
ities for drama are so great, my brain is over-
heating. I don’t even have to care about Jesse
finding a‘ woman he loves, I can watch in hopes
of tension between the spy and the women, the
spy and Jesse and the regular, inevitable cat-
fight tension. ,

And to top it all off, Jesse has already given

_out a-special, pre-ceremony, “first-impression

rose” that sparked some estrogen issues. He’s
“forgotten” one woman’s name, resulting first in

the extension of a rose to the wrong woman, and —

then the addition of an extra rose to compensate
for J esse’s true desires. If that’s not enough, pre-

views promise there will be. some sort of “stalk-

er” later on. - 0 _

It’s all justso exciting. I can barely keep my
finger off the channel-up button.

But I will. I refuse to abandon ship just yet.
There’s still hope for this show turning out to be
somewhat “normal.” Just as soon“as the spy’s
gone, the gold diggers get booted, the host stops
popping in with surprise roses and dating situa-
tions, and Jesse‘ becomes somewhat lovable. I
think things will get back to the good 01’
“Bachelor” beginnings.

Then again, there are reruns of “Seinfeld” on
at that time, too. »

These Irish boys make a greataddition to collection

Final Straw

Snow Patrol
A&M Records
sfnfnik

Recommended if you like:
Coldplay, Travis

Performing music both poetic and
endearing, Snow Patrol earns its place
in your CD collection. These Irish boys
— Gary Lightbody on vocals, guitarist
Mark McClelland and drummer
Johnny Quinn — got together in 1994,
and were soon signed on to Jeepster

Records. Inspired by such American ’

bands as Soundgarden, the Pixies and
Dinosaur Jr., their fusion of pop-rock
and steady, melodic guitar beats is a
perfect combination.

Not happy with their progress,
Snow Patrol parted ways from their
label in 2001 and joined A&M
Records. They were lucky enough to
get a chance to pair up with producer
Garret Lee, and went on to release
Final Straw, an album of Britpop per-
fection. They knew that this album
would bring them out of their indie-pop
scene in Glasgow, and to the success
they have worked so hard to achieve.

This album is chock full of the
British pop we have come to love with

bands such as Coldplay and Travis. It’s
not just Lightbody’s songwriting, but
also his delivery that wins you over. He
has the soft, melodic vocals to create
beautiful pop songs

The standout song on this album is
“Run.” Slightly reminiscent of
Co1dplay’s “Yellow,” it’s just as light-
hearted and romantic. Lightbody car-
ries his haunting voice over the song,
and brightens up just enough to perk up
the refrain, “Light up, light up/ as if
you have a choice/ even if you can not
hear my voice/ I’ll be right beside you

dear.” The touch of his accent makes ,

the romantic song a work of art.

Another song in which he uses his
vocals to his full potential is
“Somewhere a Clock is Ticking,” in
which his voice pleads, backed by an
interesting combination of strings and
echoing voices.

With these songs, there are the
feel-good ones, like their first single,
“Spitting Games,” which is just like
puppy-dog romance. It gives you the
same rush as forming a new crush.

The only flaw of Snow Patrol is

their tendency to get a little over-sappy.‘
Their tear-stained lyrics can be some- .

what overemotional at times. It wins
you over with its refreshingly light
sound.

There are exceptions, of course,

This second volume is 
another triumph for Uma

_Kill Bill Vol. 2

Starring Uma Thurman, Michael
Madsen, Daryl Hannah, David
Carradine

Directed by Quentin Tarantino
s2n:x«-a1/2 

If only “Kill‘Bill” had a third
chapter.

In the time of ‘.‘The Lord of the

Rings,” not to mention the marked-
ly less satisfying “Matrix”'trilogy
and “Star Wars” prequels, Quentin
Tarantino has fashioned an epic of
his own — in two parts, for better
or worse —— that is a veritable feast
for film—lovers.

Along with the blood-splattered.

quest ofthe "Bride (Uma Thurman),
“Kill Bill Vol. 2” brings to an end
Tarantino’s quest to put his own
stamp on his beloved bastard genres
of ‘70s ‘cinema. The cumulative
effect of “Kill Bill” is enough to
convert anyone to the belief that
indeed there can be honest-to-good-
ness poignancy ,buried deep in
grindhouse nastiness.

The film begins right where
“Vol. 1” left off, with the Bride en
route to the remaining three people
on her “death list,” Budd, aka
Sidewinder; Elle Driver, aka

California Mountain Snake; -and the
man himself, Bill. . 1
Budd (Michael Madsen) is a bit-
ter, retired gunman who is still ‘up’
forgetting sadisticif the opportuni-
ty presents itself. His encounter
with the Bride results in a sequence

that is every bit as rattling as the
torture scene in “Reservoir Dogs.”
Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is a
vicious, one-eyed, muscle-car-dri-
ving murderess, a character right
out of ‘70s -badgirl flicks like
“Switchblade Sisters.”

. And then '-there’s Bill, who is
played by the brilliantly cast David
Carradine. ~“Vol. 2” gives us some
insights into Bil1’s past and why he
put that bullet in the Bride’s head to
set this whole story in motion. In
fact, the film lets us get to know all
the characters a lot better .— at
least, the ones who aren’t already
dead. “Vol.” 2” will calm the naysay;
ers who’ve charged Tarantino with
abandoning his roots in dialogue-
heavy films — there’s a lot more
talking -and a lot less punching,
kicking and slashing this time
around. ‘ /1

While Tarantino performs mira-
cles behind the camera, Thurman,
who also co-created the Bride char-
acter, performs them in front of it,
carrying the whole beast across the‘
finish line. Her performance as a
revenge-seeking ex-profession’al-
killer is as wondrously complicated
as they come. The Bride is cool,
cold, real, sexy and tragic. It’s now
obvious why Tarantino was willing
to delay the film for nine months
while the actress had a baby. ,

The only complaint I have is
that the splitting of “Kill Bill,”

which was conceived as a single,

Dilated
I ' CHRIS REYNOLDS

Technician (North Carolina State U.)

L.A.’s underground rap movement has never really
gotten the credit it deserves, even though it has given

_ rise to a number of innovative artists.

Dilated, Peoples began as a series of impromptu »

freestyle sessions with the group’s MCS, Evidence and
Rakaa, in L.A.’s Hip-Hop Shop.. They eventually unit-
ed with turntable genius DJ Babu, formerly of the Beat
Junkies. ' '

After signing with small indie record label ABB
(now sporting Durham’s own hip~hop trio Little
Brother), Dilated Peoples issued several singles and
EPs throughout the late ‘90s, including “Third Degree”
(guesting Defari of the Likwit Crew), “Work the

Angles” and “Rework the Angles” (which featured_

artists such as A.G., Defari and Xzibit).
The hype surrounding Dilated
Peoples soon became too big for the
underground. Smelling fresh meat, the
major labels came down to snatch them
up. The trio signed with Capitol Records
and Dilated Peoples’ ﬁrst major label
full—length debut, “The Platform,” was
released in May of 2000. “Expansion
Team,” the group’s sophomore release,
came out only a year later in October of

 

\

“Expansion Team” featured a small
bus load of acclaimed rap producers like
DJ ?ue'stlove I (the Roots), J uJ u
(Beatnuts), Da Beatminerz, DJ Premier
and Alchemist. ' <

“Neighborhood Watch” ‘continue
the tradition with producers Joey Chavez
(Beastie Boys, Kool Keith), Rob Tewlow.
(Fat Joe, B Rich) and Kanye West (J ay-
Z, Cam’ron, Alicia Keys)‘ ——- who also
days down guest vocals on the album’s

“The production is something that
has always drawn people to Dilated,”
Babu said. “Even when We’re not mak-
ing atrecord, me and Ev are constantly
producing and putting down beats. We’re
always working on the next thing. ‘
Obviously, for me, being a\ DJ, I’m
always trying to keep my crates current,
so when We’re out ‘on the road, me-and
Ev go crazy record shopping. We keep it

   

Dilated,” he continued. . _ . -
DJ Babu’s beats, especially the ﬁre
alarm- ———— yes, fire alarm — driven

lism extravaganza “DJ Babu in Deep
Concentration,” show his innovations, -
and his ability to rock the‘tables. '1

‘ “We’re a group that’s constantly
evolving,” said Babu. “We’re always try- ’ I
ing to ‘teach ourselves new things in
every aspect of our game.” _

The trio has undeniably evolved
since the ABB days, piling on more and‘ p
more production, but somehow hanging
on to the roots of hip-hop, some MC
and a remarkable -DJ. , ’

Dilated Peoples has made it ‘a mis-
sion to keep rap’s roots strong while‘
making. sure the branches continue to

you need to push forward and be open to new things.
You have -to be willing to go new places.”
While a few of the tracks on “Neighborhood

-Watch” fall short of the ground-breaking innovations

hip-hop needs, it is still a refreshing contrast to some of
the bunk nonsense the scene has been turning out late-
ly. '
j°It’s still imagery, battle hymns and political poet-
1y,” Rakaa said. “It’s still big beats, big cuts. But hope-
fully we’ve gotten better as songwriters, as artists, as
people.” I e
A “Watch” is laden with political commentary, with
lyrics such as “If more than half the budget goes to mil-
itary spending / less than half goes to whatever it’s
defending,” and “Is the opposite of progress

Peoples has a mission to go back to,rap’s roots andkeep it real

Dilated Peoples’ awareness is also refreshing in a
genre over-saturated with “bling bling.”

Citing the KRS-One coined term “edu-tainment,”
Rakaa said, “You can write something completely ill
but also have some social relevance to it.”

Don’t expect “Neighborhood Watch” to be the last
thing you hear from the Dilated crew.

"‘The beauty of Dilated Peoples is that we haven’t
reached where we’re supposed to go yet,” Evidence

. said. “We’ve always tried to build on the last thing we

did ——- nurture that and make it grow bigger.”

If you like groups and artists like the Roots,
Blackalicious, Talib Kweli or Jurassic 5, you should
like Dilated Peoples “Neighborhood Watch.” If you
dig Babu’s scratching as much as I do, check out some_
of his solo recordings like l997’s “Wild Stylus,” 2002’s “

. “Duck Season” or 2003’s “Duck Season 2.”

Sometimes we just need some time
to relax — something that will make
us laugh, make us smile, or just help us
have a good time doing nothing. With
that in mind, and with ﬁnals and sum-
mer approaching, I’ve put together a
list of 10 enjoyable things in sports
that are available to us all in therweeks
and months to come—in no particula
order. _ -

1) The NHL playoffs are on. .
Which, of course, means full, 20-
rninute, sudden-death overtime peri-
ods. »Which, of course, means overly
defensive play. so while you’re up at 3
in the morning workingon that 15-
page paper or studying for that molec-
ular biology final, there will be live

hockey on television in the 4th over-
time, giving you one more thing to put

V off homework to watch.

2) The NFL draft is next week-
end. To satisfy the obsessive-compul-
sive side of every sports fan, ESPN
will offer its annual coverage of the

. more than 16 hours and 250 players

that comprises the NFL draft. While
it’s fun to see whom your team selects,
it takes a truly diseased individual to
watch the show in its entirety. While
"Chris Berman can be entertaining, and
anyone can laugh at how much Mel
Kiper’s hair looks like it could be a
football helmet, _l5 minutes per pick
makes‘ for television drier than a Jamie
Dixon press‘ conference.

3) Athletes Who have funny
names. Because deepldown inside we
all have a soft spot for‘ bathroom
humor, we love to see Rangers’ pitcher
R. A. Dickey, Bradford City striker
Dean Windass, former NFL running
backs Ben Gay and Marion Butts,
NASCAR driver Dick, Trickle, and
most of all, A.C. Milan’s one-named
Brazilian midfielder, Kaka.

4) EA Sports — It’s still in the

I

, B arkley   includes Yao  as European

game. I was hooked with the 1993
Super Nintendo "releases of NBA
Showdown and John Madden Football
‘93. Over the last 11 years, EA has
come to be the pinnacle of sports video
games, with annual releases in Sports

> p from golf to rugby. Many college-age

males can’t_tell you when their taxes
are due, but know what day NCAA
Football 2005 will be released — com-
plete with Larry Fitzgerald on the
cover. EA Sports makes games that
appeal to video game players of all
interests, ages and genders, and if one '
were to make a list of the top 10 all--
time ,sports video games, 8 or 9 would
be EA products — probably 10 of 10 to
someone who’s never enjoyed the ‘SOS
mayhem that is Blades of Steel or
Tecmo Super Bowl. ‘

5) Charles Barkley. The Round
Mound of Rebound has become the
Mouth of the South, and when Sir
Charles talks, people listen. He says
what he wants, when he, wants, and
most,of the time, it’s funny. My
favorite recent Charles moment was

N ,

  

It is hard to believe, but my time at
Pitt is winding down, and this is the ﬁnal
installment of Nash’s Nocks. ‘

I know — all of you are heartbroken,
but I will leave you with some thoughts.

Before I leave, I want to get one
thing straight. During the NFL season, I
was accused several times of being -
gasp —— a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. Well
let’s set the record straight; I AM NOT,
NOR WILL I EVER BE, A STEELERS

FAN!
This will not occur for obvious rea-
sons —- I was born and raised in

Baltimore, and I think it is a sin to be a
Steelers fan. And traitors from Baltimore
who are Steelers fans anger me.

Now that we’ve straightened that -

out, let’s continue with the NFL. Some
fans are under the misguided notion that
"wide receiver Terrell Owens will give the
Philadelphia Eagles that Super Bowl title
that they have been waiting for. Well,
Owens guarantees nothing. He and quar-
terback Donovan McNabb will enjoy

. many touchdowns over the years, but the

Eagles are not ready for a Super Bowl
ring just yet.

Running back Brian Westbrook may
be another Amos Zereoue, and crumble
once it is his time to shine. Furthermore,
the trend of the last four Super Bowl
Champions has been dominantdefenses.
Think about it -4- the Baltimore Ravens
won the Super Bowl back in 2001 with
arguably one of the best defenses ever.
The New England Patriots’ have won it
twice with a strong defense, and don’t
forget_ the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last
season.

_ So it is not offense that wins champi-
onships; it is defense. This is something
that Philadelphia will lack again after the
departure of linebacker Carlos Emmons
and comerbacks Troy Vincent and Bobby
Taylor, who teamed with safeties Brian
Dawkins and Michael Lewis to form

it even causes the Rutgers football team to prac-

With only five" spring practices left, the

However, one important spot on the‘ depth

chart up for grabs is the backup quarterback .-

position.-“With the graduation of Ted'Trump”,
Anthony Cali and Terrence Shawell areboth

vying for the position. At this point, however,

neither candidate is ahead of‘ the other ‘one.

“It’s.really close,” Rutgers head coach‘Greg

some terrific plays at practice. The offense ran a

NFL hopes that Maurice Clare

VIEW

  

When mock draft predictions turn
out wrong, it is often because these
predictions are made before draft-day
trades in which picks change hands.
Last year, mock drafts went awry
when the Minnesota Vikings took too

long to pick. --

This year, there is another little
twist that may change some predic-
tions.

On Monday, the National Football
League’s appeal on the a court deci-

sion that allowed Maurice Clarett and-
- several other players who are not

three years removed from high school
to enter into the 2004 NFL Draft, will
be heard.

This appeal. is being heard less
than a week before the draft because
the NFL would prefer that this be set-
tled before the draft occurs.
Representatives of the NFL went

before a three-judge panel of the 2nd

— U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals back on

March 30 to persuade them to reverse

. the lower court’s decision. The panel

decided that oral arguments would be
heard at later date — this Monday.

The panel could make an immedi-
ate ruling on Clarett’s eligibility in
the NFL draft, and chaos may ensue.

If the court rules in favor of the
NFL, any players who were ineligible
for the draft under the old rules who
went to the trouble of hiring agents
will no longer be eligible to play col-
lege football. ,

What will they do, and will the

tt decision is reversed

NCAA be forced to let them back in?

The decision will not just affect
the NFL. There is a lot more weighing
on this decision.

The commissioner of the National
Basketball Association, David Stern,
said on SportsCenter that he is wait-
ing for the ruling, and hoping that the

courts rule in favor bf the NFL; so’ A

that he can put an end to players com-
ing straight from high school to the
NBA. ’ V -A

He expressed his feeling towards
players straight out of high school in
the NBA, and admitted that he knows
players like LeBron James, Kobe
Bryant (at least on the court) and
Kevin Garnett have been great for the
game, but their entries have opened a
door for those who are truly not ready
to step into the world, of professional
sports.

The NFL is afraid of the same
thing occurring, and that is why it is
appealing the court’s initial ruling. -

And-if the courts read into case
law and ‘follow precedent set before
them, they should rule in favor of the
NFL. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation is allowed tokrefuse job
applicants lacking college degrees.
Doctors and lawyers are supposed to
have college degrees, so why not ath-

~ letes —— professional athletes at that?

For lawyers and doctors, the
nature of their job does make it more
important for themto have an educa-
tion as opposed to a football or bas-
ketball player, but the fact is, the law
does not prevent firms or hospitals
from‘ setting’ educational require-
ments. ‘ «

So why not the NFL or the NBA?

These are professional leagues,
are they not? A

' This is"why I hold that the NFL,
and in essence, the NBA, should win
their appeal on Monday. .

So’ what' exactly should be done?

The NFL and the NBA should be
allowed to set an educational require-
ment for players, which would, in
essence, set an age requirement.

I’m‘ sorry, Mike Williams.‘ I’m

,sorry, all you freshly graduated high
schoolstudents who applied for the
draft. And I’m sorry, Clarett. You all
will have to wait your turn and go
back, oreven, justgo to college for

“couple years. . ‘

It’s not that tough.

Larry Fitzgerald‘ did it. Donovan
McNabb did it. And, believe it or not,
Randy ‘Moss did it as well. ;

Jimmy Johnson is a staff writer for

Europeans in the NBA, that, “Any
player who ain’t from here, ‘they’re

6) NASCAR Post-Race
Interviews. If you’ve never heard one

of these, they are the height of unin-
tentional comedy. Certain rules apply,
like always referring to the car in the
third person —— for example, the No.
88 UPS Ford——but never as, “my car.”

‘After thanking the pit crew and the

No. 12 Alltel Dodge, a description of
the key moments in the race follows,
which includes no "pauses for sentence

I even if it is from a much better seat.

NBA games are the best for Stargaz-
ing, including_ Jack Nicholson at
Lakers’ games and Spike Lee at
Knicks’ games. Sometimes we even
get a special treat, like J ack’s on-court
rant at the ofﬁcials during a timeout
season, or Jimmy Buffett’s
allegedly drunken tirade during a
Miami Heat game, which led to Mr.

at Chicago Bears games last season

someone please explain to me how she

8) Mike Tyson. Combine Barkley
and the NASCAR interview above,
throw in a dash of unbridled rage and

insanity, then give it the voice of a .
. Teletubby. If Mike Tyson fights again,

enjoy it, because it may be the swan
song of the only quality heavyweight
not named Lennox in the post-Ali era.
because Tyson and
Michael Jackson battle constantly to
be the strangest American millionaire
since Howard Hughes, and you know
you can’t turn away and not watch a
train wreck.

arguably the best secondary in the NFL.
' Therefore, teams will not only run all
over the Eagles next season, but will be

able to pass more effectively, too. So,

T.O., enjoy that money, but don’t expect
to be a champion in Philly anytime soon.
Yeah, I said it!

Instead, I pick both the Washington
Redskins and Dallas Cowboys to ﬁnish
ahead of the Eagles in the NFC East next
season. If that doesn’t happen, one of
these teams will win that division.

As far as baseball goes, things are
just so unpredictable right now. I still will
stay with my pick of the New York

Yankees being the best team in the
American League East. Even though the
Yankees have stumbled out of the gate,
they have the most promise. As long as
pitchers
Vazquez stay healthy, and Mike Mussina
pitches to his potential, the Yankees
should ﬁnish on top.

The Anaheim Angels are the other
extremely talented team in the American
League. Anaheim swooped in and stole
outﬁelder Vladimir Guerrero _from my
Orioles, but I like its chances with the
additions of outﬁelder Jose Guillen, along
with pitchers Bartolo Colon and Kelvim
Escobar.

I expect the Angels and Yankees to

Kevin Brown and Javier-

face off in the American League
Championship Series, with Anaheim con-
tinuing on to the World Series. The
Angels will imitate the Patriots by taking
a year off from winning the champi-
onship only to return and win their sec-
ond title in three seasons. Who will they
face? Get back to me in September.

Well, that’s all I have to say. Even
though I know a lot of you have not
agreed with what I’ve written over the
past three years, I would like to thank you
for reading my columns anyway.
