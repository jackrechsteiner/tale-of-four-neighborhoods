Pitt senior Malachi Walker wason his
way to Uncle Sarn’s to get lunch, but when

he heard about Pawfest, he decided to stop " 0
-by because there would probably free

food. , ,

When he went to the Lower Lounge of
the William-Pitt Union Monday afternoon,
he not only found free food, but he also
found out about the career services available

—atPitt.

Throughout the room, tables and games
were set up to teach students about Pitt
Pathway’s four steps.

The Pathway teaches students the steps
toward getting a_, career ‘after college. The
ﬁrst step is getting to know yourself; second,
exploring career options; third, getting expe-
rience; and fourth, ﬁnding the right graduate

O school or career.

At each station‘, career counselors were
available to talk to the students about the
steps. -

Marvin Roth, director of career services,
said Pawfest was a way to publicize the Pitt
Pathway and to show students the resources
available to them. -

He encouraged ' students, even ﬂesh-
men, to use the service. V

Students at Pawfest enjoyed four different stations to guide them in careers.

event because she ‘wants to graduate within
four years.
“This is a good way to get on track and
ﬁnd out what I want to do,” she said.
Aftervisiting each table, Walker and the

other students got a sheet stamped by the

counselors. After getting stamps from the
four stations, students could use the sheet to
enter a contest for a Best Buy gift certiﬁcate.
The sheet gave students a second chance to
win, because upon entering, students could
also sign up for the prize.

“I’m here,” Walker said. “Now I have to
play along.”

y At the ﬁrst station, students could pick a
picture from among many on an easel. After
picking it, students received printouts about
what their picture selections meant about
them, and why they were drawn to them.

Walker said his description ﬁt him well.

At that step, students ‘could also guess
what some celebrities’ college majors were.

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Early Saturday morning, one person
was shot 'while visiting a house on
Semple Street in Oakland.

According to city police, around
1:05 a.m., four men entered the-house at
362 Semple St. and went up to the second
ﬂoor. They were told to leave the resi-
dence, but, at first, the four did not leave.

After the four men left, others who
had been in the house went outside. One
of the four men who had entered then
took out a gun and shot one of the people
who had come out of the house.

The victim, who did not live in the
house and is not a Pitt student, was shot
in his right bicep: After hitting his arm,
the bullet went into his chest.

Police did not release the victim’s
name. _

After the shooting, the four men ﬂed
the scene on foot.‘ They returned a while
later, though, and ﬁredmore shots before
ﬂeeing the scene in a Dodge Neon;

There were between 12 and 20 peo-
ple in the house when the four men
arrived.

Police have not caught the suspects’.

The suspect who ﬁred the shots was
described as a black man, between 20
and 22 years old, and about 5 feet 10
inches and 180 pounds. According to
witnesses, he has a dark complexion,
rounded cheekbones and closely cropped
hair.

Phase one of the construction,
known as the Second Century Campaign,
consists of creating a sunken walkway,
replacing the current entrance with
Romanesque pillars and developing a
welcome area, capped by a glass dome,
reminiscent of Phipps’ Victorian her-

"itage. ,

In addition, plans include the instal-
lation of a 75-seat, casual cafe, expanded
gift shop and visitor lockers.

Construction of the Tropical Forest,
a two-story education and administration '

Actress Reese Witherspoon was an English
literature major in college, and she went on

to be a movie star.

According to Debra Johnson, a career
cormselor, the activity was used to show that
the things people do after college are not
always linked to their majors. Self-assess-
ment and consideration of interests are
important parts to choosing a career, she
At the second stage, Walker, a ﬁnance
major, said he was interested in“ getting into
real estate. But he added, “I don’t want to
work for anyone.”

'Career”Counselor Kelli Robinson said
ﬁnding a job that ﬁts his personality is
important She advised him to network with
Pitt alums at a homecoming event.

At the third station, which focused’ on
getting experience, Walker learned about
long term and short term study abroad

opportunities at Pitt. Semester at Sea allows
students to go away for as many as 100 days,
while other programs, such as those orga-
nized by Amizade, go on much shorter trips,
some lasting only about two weeks.

Had Walker known about the shorter
trips earlier in college, he said, he would
have gone on one.

Between the third and fourth stations,
Walker stopped to play a game. Although he

didn’t win by throwing beanbags through a _

hole in a board, he still got a bag of prizes,

At the fourth station, Walker told the

Three years of high school not ideal

A law passed in Florida this
spring will permit motivated high-
school students to graduate in three
years, allowing them to bypass six
credits of art, gym and life—skills
classes but requiring them to double
up on English and take two years of
foreign language classes. It was
passed with several other laws as part
of a voter-approved initiative to
reduce class sizes.

On paper, the option to graduate
sooner is an excellent one, but in
practical terms, the law is shortsight-
ed and ill-advised.

The students most affected by the
measure — smart kids interested in
their own academic careers — are
often bored stiff in high school class-
es, and forcing them to linger in gym
class until they can get to college
seems pointless,

Some opponents of the law say
early graduation would deprive stu-
dents of the important social aspects
of senior year. No one is going to

force kids to take the option, so those‘

who would sorely miss the prom and
homecoming won’t opt out of senior
year, and the kids who would want to
forego senior year are likely the same
ones who’d rather stay home watch-
ing Dr. Who marathons and writing
computer code than dance
Macarena in arented tuxedo.
The unfortunate reality of the sit-

the h

uation, however, is that parents will
take over, and academic stage_-moth-
ers and -fathers will get overzealous.
Parents will pressure their children to
graduate sooner, as a mark of honor,
superiority and achievement. These
are the same parents who’ve been
forcing their children into ballet
lessons since age 3, living vicarious-
ly through their sons and daughters,
and early graduation would be just
another plume to feather their caps
with. ’ '

A very few 16- or 17-year-olds
are mature enough to handle ‘the
unique challenges of college — and
the kids who plan to graduate early
certainly are the ones who have col-
lege on the horizon. Most simply
aren’t up to the rigors of college life,
and the ones who get forced into
early graduation by their parents
have probably been dealing with
enormous pressure from their parents
for years. Such kids, in a university
setting, could be social and emotion-
al disasters waiting to happen.

Society is in enough of a rush to

“erase childhood. For a bright, moti-

vated high school student, serving
one more year in the prison known as
high school may be a pain, but it’s a
necessary one on the path to adult-
hood, and one that won’t prevent

them from having a brilliant academ- A

ic career — eventually. 4

An eventful summer of queer happenings

Finally, we subscribers to the

radical homosexual agenda can
begin considering new business.

The summer of queer happenings
was nothing less than active.

It was bookended by our very
own Sen. Rick Santorum; he began
the summer by attacking any right to
privacy we as citizens have and
ended it by rallying the troops to
destroy the notion of same—sex mar-
riage. P

So what happened in -
the meantime? -

The immediate back-
lash against  Santorum

decided to join the fray.

gay man to be a bishop.

There was overwhelming sup-
port for Father Gene Robinson, but
the loudest words of dis-
sent came from
Pittsburgh’s own Bishop
Robert Duncan: “May
God have mercy on this
church.” -

Quit emasculating the language, you Microsoft pansies

There’s no question that Microsoft is con-

trolling our language surreptitiously through its

Word program.
I noticed it for the first time last year, when

I typed in the word “man-hour,” and a thin green‘

line emerged underneathit. Word suggested I
change it to “person—hour.”

“Person-hour?”

You’re liable to get your ass kickedsaying
that hyphenated idiocy where I come from —
Powder Mill‘ Lane, the most badass neighbor-
hood in suburban Whiteyville.

There’s no denying that, with Microsoft
Word being the most widely used word process-
ing program —— short of spelling your name out
with doo-doo on. your finger‘ — they, as in
THEM, can change the way we talk.-

What gives them the right to" defenestrate an
ethos of integrity for such furtive machinations
to modify the American lexicon in the name of
their political latitudes?

I mean, what’s the deal with that, huh?
Here’s some of what I’m talking about:

Mankind to humanity, man-made to synthet-
ic, caveman to cave dweller —- a cave dweller?
What is that, a vegetable?

What’s the issue with getting rid of‘ the MAN
in every facet of our language? So what if it’s
politically incorrect, can’t we just call everyone

.a congressman instead of a “congressional repre-

sentative?”

Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not against
women —— some of my best friends are women ——
but I just love the word “man.”

That word was chiseled out of a monolithic

rock by awesome primitives with their huge,
meaty, unshaven wangs, forged \with sweat and
gusto for all to marvel at. _

When I think of the word “man,” I’m trans-
ported to a blue-collar factory, watching good,
honest, shirtless Joes forging steel for war-
planes, beating the metal into submission with
their proud, veiny erections with saucy li’l’ hard-
hats on them. Excuse these homo-
erotic descriptions, but I just love the

makes love to frogs — and I will not have his
sanctified memories besmirched by this devilish
bastardization of all that is good and honest

about doing it with li’l’ froggies in a pond, or in

the bathtub sometimes.
Besides, why should Microsoft decide on
“frog associate?” What about “frog compadre?”
I think the families of these strange but won-
derful frogmen who gave their lives
for this country should get together
and bitch a lot about this issue.
That would really be something.
Obviously, this filthy conspiracy
goes far beyond Microsoft. The white-
washing effect’ of politically correcting
our language is completely superﬂu-
ous, because it’s only nominal.
It’s not making people more
understanding or less racist, or helping

thought that one was clean. Isn’t
homemaker just another stupid euphemism any-
ways?

For instance, when I was a kid, janitors were
called janitors. Then, they were called custodi-
ans. And THEN they were called maintenance
engineering supervisors.

What was inherently offensive with the title
of janitor? If they’re‘ so freakin’ sensitive about
it, why don’t they just call themselves the “I Do

-Important Stuff and My Life is Meaningful’

Happy Brigade?” How does that sound?
Euphemistic enough for you?
“Frogman” to “frog associate” —damn it,

this one really pisses me off. My grandfather
died a frogman — as I understand it, a man who

phy, with his third-grade recycling project, no!

It’s just making some schmo feel really awk-

gives you the bag of peanuts on an airplane a

For the last time, you -sons of bitches, this
isn’t Pussytown — excuse me, Feminine

So get over it, you pansy stewardesses, and

While all of us queers sit on the

He is trying to collect enough
support to amend the e U.S.

When the gates open at a sporting event or
concert, people have generally been waiting out-
side for hours ahead of time. It isn’t just because‘
they are that gung-ho about watching the Panthers
kick the Golden Flashes’ asses, and it isn’t mere-
ly because they are that eager to hear Dave
Matthews perform. They’re there to tailgate.

Think about it. There’s something special
about setting up “camp.” From kegs and mini-
grills to fold—up chairs and the sound of battery-
draining car stereos blasting, tailgating brings
people together.

When I got to the parking lot at Heinz Field
on Saturday, the first thing I did was call some
friends to find out where they were tailgating.
Kick off was hours away, but the beer flowed
from kegs, and smoke wafted all around as burg-
ers_and hot dogs were cooked.

Your involvement with a group ‘can define
whom you will be tailgating with, and where. Our
first stop was the hockey team, who arrived there

hours before we did. They were already a little‘

buzzed, and the game-day energy was rampant."
Our next stop was to visit the people from the
frat that we hung out with in our pre-21 days.
Beer pong and flip cup games were being played
everywhere and" we “old heads” watched the
novices get some experience. As we walked from
one end of the parking lot,‘ to the other, cheers of
“Let’s ‘go Pitt!” and, everf still, “P-E-_N-N S-T

Some of my best memories from sporting
events and concerts stem from tailgating. Then
again, some of the best things I don’t remember
stem from tailgating, too.

Waking up at 7 am. to be among the first in
the parking lot for the last Pitt vs. Penn State
game until, at least 2008, I just couldn’t seem to
quench my thirst for a certain hoppy beverage.

beating down on us and wewere sweaty and sun-

— we were going to get tickets when we got there
— but we were having so much fun in the parking
lot that it just seemed pointless to pay to hear the
music that we already could for free from our

. prime spot.

Heck, even snow can’t keep tailgaters away.

_Just look at the parking lot before last season’s

Pitt vs. West Virginia University game. It was a
sea of blue and gold, and, despite the frigid
weather, fans were yelling at other fans about
their respective teams as a backyard brawl
unfolded in the parking lot. ’

A game wouldn’t be a game and a concert
wouldn’t be a concert without a tailgate. This
isn’t to say that alcohol makes the event. Sure, it

can make things a bit more fun and interesting, - ‘

but the camaraderie is what makes the event spe-
cial.

And at a tailgate party, there is always plenty’

It happens all of the time: An
artist takes a collection of great
music, strangles it, beats it up, and
releases a complete travesty of the
original collection to the public,

who, in turn, fail to realize the qual— V

ity of the collection in its original
form. Many Radiohead fans fear the
worst from a release like this, and
might wonder, “How could they do
this again to my beloved tracks from
0.K. Computer?” . —
Radiohead fans need not worry.
This time, the result is very satisfy-
ing. True Love Waits, named after a

Radiohead song .of the same name,

is a collection of 15 Radiohead
songs, chosen from the six albums
they have released so far, performed
solely by Pittsburgh native

"Christopher O’Riley on a grand

piano. Now you are asking, “How
could this work?”

‘ There are a few reasons. Anyone
who has seen Radiohead’s music on

songs are inherently classical pieces
of music. Because of this, they
transfer very well to classical piano.
Another reason is that Christopher
O’Riley is a trained classical
pianist. Amazingly, he plays the
vocal melodies, along with all of the
instruments in each Radiohead song,
on a single piano.‘Only electronic
layers are missing, and he even
includes those at times. t
O’Riley is not only a classically
trained pianist; he is also a huge
Radiohead fan. He can frequently be
found on many of their message
boards, conversing with other fans.

As a result, his interpretations of
their songs are refreshing, while still

The Pitt women’s soccer team
struggled to ﬁnd an offensive spark last
season, but this year, the team has had
no problem in that department.

Pitt (2-1) had no trouble offensive-
ly, or defensively, for that matter, in
Saturday’s 3-1 victory over the
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County at Founders Field. .

Senior Netta Agredano and sopho-
more Erin Hills led the way for Pitt
with a goal and an assist each.

Sophomore Jennifer DeLaHoz

noon. Also contributing to the scoring
were sophomore Sara Gutting and

Sue—M0y Chin said. “We worked hard
for 90 minutes, which we have worked
on, keeping the intensity and focus for
the entire game, and we did that
today.” .

The defensive group of Jacqueline
Reuter, Carli Brill and Courtney
Wrightson had a stellar performance,
as they only allowed eight. shots to
reach sophomore goalkeeper Jamie
Pelusi. Pelusi had ﬁve saves in the
game and only allowed one goal,
which was on a penalty kick.

« Pitt came out ﬁring and was able to
strike first in the game on a goal by
Agredano in the ninth minute of play.

Harris says Panthers won’t overlook any opponent

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer
Walt Harris had one message for fans and the
media at Monday’s press conference after Saturday’s
43-3 victory over-Kent State.

' He stressed that Pitt will not take any game for
granted and will look to improve and build upon its
first win of the season. .

“There’s no taken-for-granted games; every game
is a struggle,” Harris said. “Al1you’ve got to do is take
a look at the scores around the country and you’ll real-
izethat it [anupset] can happen at anytime.”

Panthers quarterback Rod Rutherford was able to
put ‘his off-the-ﬁeld incident aside and throw for a
career-high four touchdown passes on Saturday.

“I thought Rod came in and performed tremen-
dously,” Harris said. “He did ,an outstanding job of
keeping his mind in the rightarea. I thought [Rod]

threw some laser beams. The ball wasn’t in the air_

very long.” *

Aside from being enthusiastic about his team’s
performance, coach Harris was thrilled over the atten-
dance at Saturday’s game.

“I was most excited about this (holding up a copy
of the Pitt News) — not so much the picture of Larry,

but the picture of the crowd in the background,” Harris -
‘ said. “I think that’s so exciting for our football pro-

gram and our football team and hopefully for the city

I of Pittsburgh.” a

Coach Harris wasn’t the only one who was excit-
ed about Saturday’s turnout. Starting left guard Dan
LaCarte felt that the fans played a role in the team’s
success.

“To have all the fans support [Pitt] and to have
56,000 at the game for the first night is something we
didn’t have before,” LaCarte said. “It helped us get
excited and come out and get out of the gates quick.”

‘ The biggest area of concern for "coach Harris was
the special teams play. . '

“We want to improve our special teams the most,
especially the area of kick coverage and punt protec-

tion,” Harris said. “Those two areas We’re not pleased ’

with. We’re a lot better than that, and We’re going to
take care of that business.” _ '

One player who continues to demonstrate progress
is starting tailback, Brandon Miree. Dating back to last
season, Miree has rushed for 100 yards or more in four
consecutive contests. \

“I thought Brandon ran tremendously’ in, the
game,” Harris said. “I just  Brandon is making
the reads. Last year, he just wasn’t as consistent at
that.” I

Coach Harris also confirmed that Rutherford is no
longer a question mark as the starter.

“Rod will be our starting quarterback, and we plan
to play Luke [Getsy],” Harris said-. “We always like to
play our young quarterback because he is one play

, away from starting. I_ thought Luke did a-real good job;

we justdidn’t catch the ball. We had three drops..No

quarterback does well when you have drops.”

Harris was also impressed with first year starter
Brian Bennett, who had a big game at linebacker, lead-
ing the Panthers in tackles. -v

“Brian is an intelligent young man,” Harris said.
“He’s very energized to come and play, but he’s not as
big as some of the other guys we’ve played. He’s one

i of those high-energy guys who are excited about play-

ing. We think he’ll continue to get better.” ,

This week, the Panthers take on the Ball State
Cardinals, who are coming off a tough loss to
Missouri. .

“Ball State had a~good game against Missouri,”
Harris said. “Missouri is a ranked football team, and I
thought Ball State played them tough.”

LaCarte echoed coach Harris‘ belief that Ball State
must be taken seriously.

‘ “We don’t look past any opponent,” LaCarte said.
“I think Ball State is a very formidable opponent. They
won six games last year and have a lot of returning
starters on defense, so it’s going to be a tough game.”

Coach Harris shoulders, the responsibility of not
only getting the team prepared, but also making sure
that the team stays focused and ‘does not look beyond
any opponent. _

“The goal of the football coach is to get the play-
ers to practice like it’s a game,” Harris said. “Coaches
aren’t concerned about games down the road. They
better notbe, or else they’ll get beat. We know we
have an opponent that is going to be toughpto beat.”

Pant ers’ season rests onRuther ord3s toughness

If there were any doubts about Pitt
quarterback Rod Rutherford’s mental
toughness and ability to lead Pitt this sea-
son, hopefully those worries are now put
to rest. ' .

Less than a week after having sexual
assault charges thrown at him, Rutherford
stepped up. Yeah, Rutherford was facing
Kent State, but having to worry about
your future can mess with anybody’s psy-
che.

Backup quarterback Luke Getsy
started the game and did an admirable
job, but the chemistry did not seem to be
there. Getsy made good throws, but
receivers dropped passes.

Rutherford entered the
game in the second quarter
after serving his punishment
and immediately threaded the

needle with a 20-yard strike to A son, Rutherford will need to

face this:’season., Walt Harris has handled

the situation as well as could be expected.

Pitt has had enough such issues for
one season and it has only played one
game. Yes, the Panthers have shown their
resilience and mental. toughness thus far,
but they are only human, and if the off-
ﬁeld issues continue, at some point, the
team will suffer as a result.

I encourage all of ,Pitt’s athletes to
learn from the mistakes of. athletes such as
Kobe Bryant and Maurice Clarett, or to
read my column .from two weeks ago.
Teams have more to worry about, like
upcoming opponents.‘ S A

Walt Harris said in his press confer-

ence that the team will not be looking past

any opponent this season, but will be

looking to build from their ﬁrst win. The V

Panthers‘ need to take this advice serious-
ly.

The Panthers have owned Virginia
Tech the past two seasons, and.Miami did
not look very impressive in its win over

. Florida, despite its big comeback.

There have been too many upsets
during the ﬁrst two weeks of the season,
and we would hate to have a repeat of two
years ago, when Pitt lost to South Florida.

A AWhile many fans are probably look-

Tech, West Virginia and Miami," the
Panthers carmot look past. Boston
College, Rutgers or Temple — especially
since Boston College upset No. 25-
ranked Penn State, 27-14, over the week-
end. ‘

Over the summer, Pitt was receiving
a lot of national recognition, and I chal-
lenged Harris to capitalize on it. From the
looks of things, he has already taken steps
to answer the challenge.

He appears to be determined not to
repeat mistakes from the past, so that the

Panthers can have a proﬁtable ‘future. The‘

first step is having control of his team, and
Harris seems to have a good formula for
accomplishing that.

Panthers’ defense holds on in the second half for victory

Soccer, page 9

ball in from inside the six—yard line.

The Panthers dominated the ball in their offen-
sive end throughout the half, and any chance that the
Retrievers (1-2) had to move the ball was quashed by
Pitt’s defense and cleared back to the offense.

The intensity of both teams heightened after the
first goal, and the game became very physical for the
next 20 minutes. The Panthers took control of the
game when they scored their second goal, in the 32nd
minute of play, on a free kick from Hills to DeLaHoz.

Hills booted a free kick from 40 yards out to_

DeLaHoz, who controlled the ball and made a strong
run to the goal. DeLaHoz hammered the ball to the
left side of the goal past the outstretched arms of the

diving goalkeeper.

Pitt maintained its momentum during halftime,
and, although the Retrievers attempted to get scoring
chances early in the second half, the defense
remained solid- 7

Although Pitt was not as dominant early in the
second half, it did tack on a goal in the 51st minute.
Agredano retrieved the ball on the ﬂy and made a
race to the goal against a single UMBC defender.

The defender held strong to an alert Agredano,
who dropped a pass to a charging Hills. Hills took the
pass in stride and blasted a shot from 22 yards out to
the top right of the goal, extending Pitt’s lead to 3-0.

Pittgcontinued to stop all advances by the.

Retrievers until the 71st minute, when UMBC

received a penalty kick after an off-the—ball foul

occurred inside the 18-yard line. Missy Moore boot-
ed the ball to the right, past Pelusi, making the score
3-1.

The penalty, kick brought a new intensity to
UMBC, but Pitt equaled its intensity, returning to the
form they had in the first half by dominating the ball
for the remaining 24 minutes of the game.

“We scored on two set pieces today, a corner kick
and a_ free kick. At halftime, I said, ‘Let’s get one in
the run of play,’ and we were able to do that, which I
was very pleased about,”_Chin said.

The Panthers controlled the contest for nearly all
of the 90 minutes, holding the advantage in shots, 10-
8, and corner kicks, 3-1.

Pitt returns to action on Sept. 12, when they trav-
el to Lehigh for the first game of a six—game road trip.
