Professors for
Peace debate
war tactics  

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

Women, macroeconomics» and the
media all have one thing in common.
They are part of the debate over the war
on terrorism.

They were also among the many
issues discussed during a te~ach—in
Friday in Posvar Hall. The event, titled
“Why are we at war?” was sponsored by
the women’s studies program, Students
in Solidarity and the Arab Students
Organization.

But many of the presenters were
members of the newly formed
Professors for Peace and Justice, an
organization of faculty and graduate stu-
dents “distressed by the cyclical nature

" of violence.”

“We got together because there
were a lot of people against the war,”
said Carol Stabile, director of the

_;women’s studies program and member

of Professors‘ for'Peace. C _

- _ Clark‘ Henderson,’ a graduate ‘stu-
dent in the English department, said the
group -is in the formative stages.

,"“The ﬁrst phase of the organization

' is just to reach out topeople who might
‘be interested,” Henderson said.

 g Professors for Peace was brewing
for ‘several months before formally com-

- _ ing together as a Pitt organization.

. “It was mostly. a response to the
lack of sufficient response to 9-11,”

: Henderson said. “Especial1y.the lack of

response among faculty.”

 Professors for Peace is the ﬁrst

' “The students were so thankful for
faculty involvemen_t,”* Stabile. said,

’ “because they'don’t have tenure and a

lotof the protections that faculty have.”

The te_ach—in consisted of three
hour-longx breakout sessions during.
which participants could choose from

‘presentations on topics ranging from “A

Basic History of U.S. Foreign Policy” to
“International Criminal ‘ Court and the

College Bowl Tournament pits
the best against thebrightest

LAUREN BAN
I Staff Writer

“How fast can you think?”
This was definitely the theme of the

-annual College Bowl Tournament, held

Sunday afternoon in the Ballroom and
Assembly Room of the William Pitt
Union.

3 The competition, sponsored by Pitt
Program Council, featured 10 teams of

‘ four students. Teams were allowed only

one alternate, and one graduate student.

.’ The tournament took, the form of a

double elimination competition, with
two seven—minute halves. Players
buzzed in to answer questions ranging
in subject from movies, music, history,
sports and current events, to name a
few.

But onecould deny the excitement
of the Steelers game, and Pitt Program
Council’s recreation director Rebecca
Yates didn’t try to, as she started off the
toumament announcing that the game
would be playing on mute in the back
of the Ballroom throughout the after-
noon.

Indeed, the thrill of the tournament
was only matched by the excitement of
the football game, as students rushed
over to the makeshift television area in
hopes of catching a glimpse of the
game in between rounds of the compe-
tition. Halfway through the toumament,
students brought in a bigger television,

as more and more of them gathered

- around to watch the game on the bigger

screen. 1 . _

The students all had their own rea-
sons for competing in the tournament.

“I’ve never done this, but I found
out this team needed another person
and I really like to answer questions, so
I decided to do it,-” said Kristin Fino.

Players competed against each
other to try to win a spot in the region-
al competition, which will include
teams from other -surrounding P states,

and will be held at Pitt this year on Feb. '

15 and 16. '
Yates explained that the four stu-

dents chosen to compete in the regional ,

competition would not all be from the
same team. Rather, the judges would be

looking for individual students in, the:
competition who would represent “the -

best of the best.”

The panel of judges was ﬁve _mem- I
bers of Pitt Program Council, including ,
Yates, as well as Joe Cavalla, ‘Christina  V

Graham, Michelle Wydra and Tom
Misuraca.

Members of the winning team each
received a $25 gift certiﬁcate to Barnes

and Noble, while the second place team.  

winners received_coffee mugs.

The four chosen students to com-
pete in the regional competition will be
determined later in the week, after the
panel members compile and compare
results.

Issue of Military Tribunals,” each led by
a graduate student or professor.

One of the workshops, led by
Jennifer Lentfer of the Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs,
focused on the role of women in
Afghanistan and other fundamentalist
countries.

“Women’s oppression is an aquifer
running under everything,” Lentfer said.
She also called the media’s focus‘ on

.Afghan women a tactic to ensure sup-

port from American women.

“This is a way that women [in the
United States] will have an inner con-
ﬂict,” Lentfer said.

Stabile, whoparticipated in the lee-
ture said that treatment _of women is
often a warning sign for religious
extremism. ’

“One thing that fundamentalisms
have in common is a hatredof women,”

Stabile said. “'I‘here’-"s a strange strain of
misogyny in Christian fundamentalism,
Islamic fundamentalism, all of them.”
Other workshops included “VV1th
Malice Toward None,” a look at peace-
ful alternatives to the war on terrorism,
led by Henderson and‘ physics graduate
student Ramin Skibba..In the discussion,"

Henderson commented on an address by.

President George W. Bush, whom he

referred to as “a man of a rather simplis- -
tic nature?’, on. Martin Iéiuther King Jr

Day.   
“He praises King’s nonviolence
while he drops bombs,” Henderson said.
Henderson and Skibba also criti-
cizedthe media’s coverage of the ‘war on
terrorism. * _ .
.“The rhetoric of the war is such that

it will be waged justly,” Henderson said. ~

‘”I'hat’s just a lie.  I think that if the
media were to cover things objectively,
there would be a big group of people
against the war.” ' _

Sophomore Zainab Hassan spent yesterday afternoon studying, alone, on the
Cathedral lawn during the Steelers game.

Tailgating fans get

swung his Terrible Towel in the air follow-
ing the winning pong shot. Fans all over the

parking lot saw the towel like acall to arms. T

The crowd joined in. Those not annod with
yellow rags just shouted. L '

Across from the beer pong tournament,
a line of anxious fans waited outside a pair
of portable toilets. Too much, beer and not

enough facilities had a line of men watering '

a dumpster next to PNC Park.

Across the .parking lot, four large
speakers pumped Queen’s “We W111 Rock
You.” Fans held up their drinks to acknowl-
edge the sentiment. '

Scattered through the chaos, optimistic
fans held signs reading, “I Need Tickets.”

‘ One man in a tattered Stoelers jacketheld up

two‘ ﬁngers at a line of cars. Presumably he
needed two tickets. No one stopped Extra
tickets were as in demand as the portable
toilets.

The streets of Oakland were silent at
kickoff. Hcmingway’s, covered in black
and gold regalia, was closed, as was student
favorite Petcr’s Pub. A few people stood at
the bar at Prirnanti Brothers but the tables
were empty. Fuel and Fuddlc was also
deserted aside from a couple of patrons in
Ste'e1ers_hats at the bar and some disinterest-
ed students at booths around the restaurant
If Oakland had tumbleweeds, they would

’ have been rolling down Forbes Avenue.

But Fuel and Fuddle manager Vrc

Bovalino said  is nothing new.

“Because it’s a home AFC game, peo-
ple arc either Downtown or at big house
parties,” Bovalino said. “_,[t’s pretty common

, for playoff games, not so much with regular
‘season ones.”

Bovalino might be the only man in
Pittsburgh who wouldn’t mind if the
Steelcrs lose. If they do go to the Super
Bowl, he said, “It’ll be even worse than

Temperatures yesterday climbed into
the 60s, weather which, on any other day
would have Pitt students sprawled across
the Cathedral of Learning lawn studying,
chatting or sleeping.

But sophomore Zainab Hassan was the ‘
only person on the lawn yesterday, sitting

with her legs crossed and studying organic

chemistry in the afternoon sun.

Hassan said she chose to study rather
than watch the game because she had so
much work to do and the weather beckoned.

“It was such a beautiful day out,” she
said. “We won’t have another day like this
for a while. Pittsburgh weather is so iffy.”

The .commons room of the Sigma

Alpha Epsilon house began to ﬁll up just‘

before kickoff. Brothers, friends and girl-

‘friends « took their seats on the beat-up

Fans accept Steeler loss with anger, resignation

couches that had been arranged in theater-
like rows in front of the Toshiba big screen
television. Empty soda cans and plates of
microwaved wings _sat on coffee tables
throughout the room. ,

. “Let’s go Steelers!” senior Mike Lynch
exclaimed as Kris Brown sent the ball into
the opposing end zone. I

Lynch, a Bethel Park native and life-
long Steelers fan, was a member of the over-
whelming majority of black and gold faith-
ful. Wﬂd cheers erupted in response to any
big play by the Steelers, while roars of dis-

gust were issued after nearly every New '

England play.

The game, and everybody’s attitudes,
took a downward turn when Troy Brown
retumed a punt for a touchdown late in the

 ﬁrst quarter. Thrown cans accompanied a

collective “Bullshit!” ﬁom the crowd after a
Steelers drive was stalled when a catch by
Hines Ward was ruled incomplete. By the
end of the ﬁrst half, the heavily favored
Steelers were down 14-3, much to the cha-
grin of the SAE crowd. —

“I don’t know if my- heart can handle
this,” said Steelers fan Colin Mitchell.

Around 11:30 am., ticket holders head-
ed toward the gates. Fans packed up their
grills, scarfed down the/leftover hot dogs,

. i- and drank as much beer as possible before

  
 
  

they had to pay $4.50 for a stadium draft.

Fans, high on the prospect of a champi-
onship team and a trip to New Orleans,
cheered and chanted as they approached
Heinz Field.

" One of the lone spots of life in Oakland
was the Delta Sigma Phi house at 255 N.
Dithridge St. There, about a dozen brothers
recovering from a late night Saturday gath-
ered for the weekly ritual of the Steelers’
game. At halftime, when the teams were in
the locker room, the war between the
Steelers fans and the antagonists was still

g.

“I hope they f——ing come back and
win, so I can throw it in your face,” Sal
Piccola said to his housemate, “Thunder”
Dan Lyons, a Philadelphia fan who was

rooting for the Patriots just to anger Piccola. '

The house had big plans for an all-
Pennsylvania Super Bowl.

“We’re gomra draw a line down the‘

middle of the room,” said Lyons, the vice
president of the fraternity.

After Kordell Stewart’s interception
ended the ﬁrst half, most of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon brothers remained conﬁdent. Some
left the game, insisting they had homework
todo.Othersrnadean1ndowntoTheOor
Eddie’s to stock up for the second half. The
rest just kicked back to shoot pool and listen
to the halftime musical stylings of Sheryl

Crow.

Despite the strong‘Stee1ers presence,
there were some that were not totally pro-
Pittsburgh. Scott Furstenau was the lone
Patriots fan.

Furstenau described the house as ‘Very
hostile,” and sounded confident when he
said, “I’m gomra be hurt.”

Mark Pawloski was another out-of-
towner. A rabid Eagles fan, Pawloski col-
ored his face and arms with green and black
Magic Marker. He even sported a home-
made Eagles shirt. . '

“I’d like to see the Steelers win,
though,” Pawloski said. “'Ihey’d match up
better against the Eagles.” ’

The second half of the game brought
with it much excitement at Delta Sigma Phi.

“Yeah! What now, bitch?” Piccola said,
jumping up and pointing at Lyons after the
touchdown by the Steelers in the third quar-
ter. “Woo! Trrne to start drinking.”

Somewhere during the drive, the plans
for Super Sunday had grown more elabo-
rate.

“If the Eagles and the Steelers are in the
Super Bowl,” Lyons said, “we’re going to
f———ing New Orleans!”

“Yeah,” Piccola said, nursing his Colt
45. “We’ll put like 37 people in Jirn’s car
like the f——ing clowns.”

Piccola knew why Adam Vrnatieri of
the Patriots missed his 47-yard ﬁeld goal

attempt.

“What did I say,” Piccola yelled. “I
called him a c—tlicker! I yelled o—tlicker!
That’s why!”

But then Kordell Stewart threw a pass
10 feet over Plaxico Burress’ head for his
second interception in as many drives and
there was nothing but stunned silence from
Piccola and the others. After a few minutes,
he looked up from his beer long enough to
respond to Lyons’ smug smile with a mut-
tered obscenity about the Eagles before
going out to the backyard, no doubt with
plans for next season’s vengeance already
brewing.

Following the Steelers’ defeat, things
went back to normal at Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. A few guys decided to shoot pool,
Lynch dejectedly walked upstairs and the
remaining people switched to the St. Louis-
Philadelphia game.

“I was scared that Bledsoe would screw
up,” said Furstenau, the Patriots fan. “I’m
just glad the Pats won.”

Colin Mitchell offered some post-garne
analysis. -
“Take those two special teams touch-
downs away and the Steelers win.” '

Back to news after Steelers loss 2
_ L°.+et+‘;er4
1 It’s time to replace the black and gold . ‘ -(awaits
ﬂags with black ﬂags of mourning. V‘ John Walker Lmdh _

Yesterday, the New England Patriots
upset our Pittsburgh Steelers 24-17 at
Heinz Field to clincha spot in next week’s
Super Bowl against the St. Louis Rams.

In the last several weeks, as the
Steelers continued to show their dominance
over the rest of the AFC, fans draped the
town in black and gold. Steelers mania took
over the news in the last week.

Yesterday, an eerie silence could be felt
after Kordell Stewart’s second fourtl1-quar-
ter interception sealed the Steelers’ fate.

Now, the collective exhale has begun.
Within a few days, Pittsburgh will retum to
normal. To prepare you for your post-
Steeler hype life, here’s a roundup" of some
of the events you may have missed last
week, as well as whether they are on their
way up or down:

V Enron

More reports keep emerging, detailing
the extensive shadiness of this corporation
once thought to be one of the best—run in the
United States. Its stock prices dropped 99
percent, CEO Kenneth Lay resigned, a for-
mer executive committed suicide, manage-
ment tried to get a bailout from several
Bush administration oﬂicials and millions
of people lost their retirement ﬁmds while
top brass proﬁted. One can only hope that
the investigation of what happened here
will be thorough and lead to criminal
charges against any wrongdoers.

Walker, who uses his mother’s name
most frequently, has recently become
known by another name in the American
media: the American Taliban. While we
would like to congratulate him for his hair-
cut — trust us, John, the shaved head looks
a lot better than the scraggly hair and the
beard — he still has a tacky nickname.
And, oh yeah, he’s on trial and could face
life without parole.

‘ Port Authority bus drivers

According to yesterday’s Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, a large percentage of Port
Authority bus drivers earned overtime pay
— in fact, last year’s pay for the top driver
was $103,318. That includes an amazing
$62,000 in overtime pay, as he worked an"
average of 80 hours per week Perhaps
some of us are in the wrong line of work

‘ Afghanistan

This week, interim Afghan President
Hamid Karzai is in the United States to
meet with officials and lobby for aid to help
his country rebuild. He also wants peace-
keepers to prevent the slide into lawless-
ness that allowed the Taliban to come into
power, which gave al Qaeda a base of oper-
ations. Now that the Taliban is gone, the
country has hope for the ﬁrst time in a gen-
eration. One can only hope that the rest of
the world will not abandon Afghanistan

again.

  Middle Eastern ‘peace
process’ doomed from start

A good and true principle holds
that any state that gives aid and
comfort to aggression
and mass murder is every
bit as culpable as the
direct perpetrators. It fol-
lows that because of the
annual $5 billion subsidy
it provides to the aggres-
sor, the United States is’
culpable for the crimes of
the State of Israel.

It has been ‘15 years
since the outbreak of the

Columnist

After ‘nearly "a decade of a farci-
cal so-called “peace process” that
was doomed from the

start, the Palestinian
people are no less
oppressed, and the
aggressors —— and their
sponsors —-— are no less
guilty of infamous
crimes.

The current" Israeli
Prime ‘Minister, Ariel
Sharon, provoked the
Al-Aqsa Intifada + as

first intifada, the mass 
uprising of the Palestinians within
the Occupied Territories of the West
Bank and Gaza. Back then the
movement was spearheaded by the
“Children of the Stones,” who grew

up and lived their entire lives under ‘

the Occupation.

Many of the Children of the
Stones in today’s intifada were born
since the first. If anything, this one
is even more bloody and desperate.
The justified anger and rage of the
people, particularly the youth, only
enflamed as -the longest military
occupation of the 20th century
dragged into the 21st.

In the intervening years, there
have been the provocations and the

lies of the occupiers, the false

promises of an incompetent nation-
al leadership under Yasser Arafat
and above all, the constant grind of
the Occupation itself with its road-
blocks, detention and torture of dis-
sidents, curfews, housing demoli-
tions and petty indignities.

prime minister.
worked on both counts.

Yet Sharon would not have been
able to -pull off his initial provoca-
tion without _the connivance of the
previous prime minister, Ehud
Barak, supposedly a man of peace.
Indeed, only the most hopelessly

_credulous —— or the most patently

self-interested, like apologists for
the U.S. foreign policy establish-
ment — are still taken in by the

Israeli Labor Party’s image as a

force for reason and moderation.

settlements in the Occupied

Territories is emblematic of its

“How‘ much longer do we have to
wait in this line?”

. “Can this guy drive any more
slowly?”

“Can we get this done any more
quickly?”

Have you found your-
self uttering any of the
above statements? If so,
you are just one of the
many individuals afflicted
with a common, yet seem-
ingly incurable disease:
lack of patience.

Author Thomas Fuller
once said, “All commend
patience, but none can
endure to suffer.” To many

   

(ark McCu1lou

Columnist

It seems that speed and efficiency
have replaced attention and detail. The
continuous ticking of the clock domi-
nates and controls our lives. And no
matter what we do, there never seems
to be enough time to get everything
accomplished in one day.

As a result, we no
longer tolerate delay, has-
sle, or anything that slows
us down. If anyone gets in
our way, beware, for you
may get knocked out more
quickly than a manager at
a Mike Tyson press con-
ference. . ‘

I, for one, have been
afflicted with this epidem-

 

 

gh

in today’s society, the word

patience has become synonymous

with suffering and agony. In the past,
oppressed cultures and individuals had
the ability to wait -— decades, even
centuries -4 to accomplish their
intended objectives. Now, waiting in
line at the supermarket or having to
read the instruction manual to pro-
gram the VCR is considered more
twisted than Enron’s accounting
books.

ic. Though I seem to have
an advanced case of this malady, I
know from merely walking around
this campus that I am not alone in this
continuous battle against impatience.
Whether it is waiting in the line at an
extremely crowded bookstore or
attempting to get a cocktail at a typical
South Oakland party, I have as much
patience and tolerance as George W.
Bush had with Texas death row
inmates.

Let us take the stereotypical
example of old people. We detest old

people driving because they slow us‘

down. When we unfortunately must
share the roads with these geriatric
drivers, we must, in essence, fall
asleep on the horn in order to keep
them driving at the nice leisurely pace
of 12 miles per hour.

As we are forced to wait behind
these individuals at the supermarket
with their seemingly endless supply ‘of
coupons for cat food and Preparation
H, our blood begins to boil, our body
temperature rises and we begin to lose
control. Why does this happen?

We have no patience.

In an effort to find at least one per-
son or group of people with even the
smallest ounce of patience and can
restore peace and tranquility to our
chaotic society, I found one group that
goes against the grain and personifies
patience at its best. In the end, I found
this group to be jugglers.

Juggling is a talent that takes time,

dedication and perseverance — but ,

then, again, how many jugglers do you’
know? After a few dropped bowling
pins and several bruises, I would end

Excepting   jug glers, is anyone patient anymore?

my attempt at juggling and forgo my
desire to be a traveling circus freak.
Few jugglers exist because few people
have the patience to learn such a difﬁ-
cult art. After close examination of
society, I can conclude with conﬁ-

dence that no one besides a juggler is

a patient individual.

So another exception to the rule
may be the fans and managers of the
band O-Town. No matter how long
anyone waits, those five guys will
never be good.

In the end, is there a cure for this
epidemic that has infected millions of
individuals? Many people contend
that everyone should just slow down
and relax. I was trying to think of a
real articulate response to these people
who preach that we all calm down and
take things slowly. But as I attempted
to think of the perfect ending, I lost
my patience.

So, screw it.

Sharon not interested in peace

overall stance, which is more
rhetorically sophisticated but no
less oppressiveand arrogant than
the Likud of Sharon and former
Prime ' Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. The settlements are
enclaves usually composed of reli-
gious fanatics, ringed with fences
and barbed wire and guarded by
Israeli troops, drawing the lion’s
share of precious resources such as
water,— even as the surrounding
Palestinian communities are
increasingly impoverished.

Since that other famous Labor‘

“peacemaker,” Yitzhak Rabin,
shook hands with Arafat and signed
the Oslo agreement in 1993, the set-
tler population in the occupied
Palestinian territories doubled. By
2000, according to data compiled
by the Foundation for Middle East
Peace and taken from Israel’s
Central Bureau of Statistics, there
were approximately 200,000 Jewish
settlers in the West Bank and Gaza
— 78 percent of whom were born in
the United States or Europe.
Barak’s so-called “final offer”
in the failed Camp David talks in
2000 —— lauded in the U.S. media as
a generous offer that was turned
do::'n by a nefarious Yasser Arafat

V.-G‘ ‘alﬂﬂitllﬂlﬂlﬂ
I DQ004101-an

‘Dill N‘-‘"“
........... ..

— was in fact a preposterous sham
that no self-respecting Palestinian
leader — nor even Arafat — could
have accepted. A

In that offer, Barak demanded
permanent Israeli control over 69
Jewish settlements amounting to
about 10 percent of the territory of
the West Bank, as well as another
10 percent to be kept under Israel’s
so-called “temporary control.” The
result would not have been an inde-
pendent Palestinian state but a
South African-style Bantustan, with
Arafat serving as Israel’s quisling.

Despite Arafat’s incessant
attempts to placate Israel and to
curry favor with the United States
— always a thankless task, since
the Israelis loved to browbeat him
even when he was their “negotiat-
ing partner” -— the entire situation
has been taken out of his hands. The
Palestinian people "will no longer
submit, and Israel’s mask of moder-
ation lowered. The only peace in
which Sharon is interested would

be a peace of the grave — a_

Palestinian mass grave. And the
blood would not be on his hands
alone.

Respect life

During the days immediately
following the Sept. 11 attack on
America, when nearly 4,000 fel-
low citizens were violently and
horrifically killed by terrorists,
images were shown of some

violence and death inflicted on
America. They were disturbing
images. They were insulting
images.

I felt the same kind of feeling
when I opened The Pitt News on
Thursday, Jan. 24 to see the infa-
mous Roe vs. Wade decision cele-
brated prominently on the front
page (“After 29 years, Roe vs.
Wade still stands”). Regardless of
the political side you’re on, and
regardless of the philosophical

life, the issues are the same as the
aforementioned Palestinians and

Palestinians who celebrated the.

_ as long as that decision stands.

' Reverend afnes Farnan
side you take as to the origins of ’

   

Americans. One side sees the acts
as death and Violence, one side
sees them as a rightfully promoted
politicalcause. .

It is about time those interest-
ed in the right to life were givena
little more respect and considera-
tion in the pages of The Pitt News.

The most telling line for those
of us who believe unborn-babies
as legitimate forms of life was
attributed to La’Tasha Mayes, the
vice president of Students for
Reproductive Freedom.

She said, “We take [the right
to abortion] for granted because’
we’ve never known life without
it.”  ‘

And she may never know life '

NANCY REDDY
Staff Writer

Two guys and a girl. One walk—up
apartment in Manhattan’s East
Village. And a forged painting that

   

  

they hope will provide them with
enough cash to fund their real dreams.

The basic plot sounds simple
enough: all the three have to do is pull
off selling a forged masterpiece. But,
the plot quickly reveals a convoluted
love triangle of sorts that proves to be
more complicated than any of the
people involved could have imagined.

Michael ' McMillian plays
Winston, an endearingly distracted
painter who subsists on Ramen and
tap water so he can pur-
sue art, his obsession.

Jarrod Fry portrays
Jamie, his frantically
energetic roommate.

Amelia, played by Jaime St. _Peter,
creates an interesting portrayal of
what could be an otherwise cliched
role, the singer-tumed-actress. Ingrid
Sonnichsen’s portrayal of Tess, the
targeted buyer of the forgery, adds
both humor and depth to the plot.

Watch

“The Credeaux Canvas” places
the three 20-somethings — Winston,
Jamie and Amelia —— in the uncom-
fortable position of being trapped
between jobs they hate and the pursuit
of their true ‘passions.

Winston spends his every spare
moment painting, but is unable to gar-
ner any critical attention. Amelia
speaks of her failed singing career by
saying, “It seems like we keep play-
ing later at night, in worse parts of
town.” And Jamie, who
has no real passion of his
own, declaims at length
about the brillianceof the
, other two.

Winston, whose complete emo-
tional ineptitude becomes more and
more obvious, is by far the most com-
pelling character in the play. V

St. Peter works hard to make
Amelia stand up to the male roles, but
she never seems to quite become the

l’Hnm t‘Hl't<'l'l’S\
(‘rm ’IHl .\Hu

dedicated starving artist the script
wants her to be. Although her portray-
al of the confused Amelia isltouching,
she does not quite match Winston’s
artistic fervor and obsession.

The dialogue is at times slightly
trite — Amelia refers repeatedly to
herself as “a wreck” and “a shell” -
and awkward, but the cast manages,
with a heavy dose of angst, to make
these lines believable. .

The set,
Ferrieri, is wonderful -and carefully
chosen music adds to the Gen-X feel
of the play.

Starting with “The Credeaux
Canvas,” the City Theatre will be
holding a series of events called City
Specials. The ﬁrst will take place
after the Feb. 1 performance of “The
Credeaux Canvas”. and will feature
new paintings by T.K. Mundokeand
the local World Beat quartet Soma
Mestizo. Student tickets are $10.

Fashionableweb sites
for stylish students

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
A Staff Writer

I don’t know about you, ‘but I
absolutely love those catalog operators.
They’re so polite, energetic and eager to
take your order right over the phone.
Ordering clothing online is an especially
easy way to go shopping — it’s just

point, click and send — and you don’t

even have to leave your dorm room.
Ladies: Want to be a ﬂaming sex
goddess, an enchanted damsel right out

. of a fairy tale, or just anyone who isn’t

wearing a spaghetti strap tank top? Try
these Web sites for tops and bottoms,
dresses and accessories that will give you
a new reputation as the next Audrey
Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe. The best
part —- they won’t leave you begging for
money outside of‘ Joe'Mama’s.

‘Web sites like BabyPhat.com,
Bebe.com, Candies.com or XOXO.com
share similar tastes in their clothing lines.
But, each has its own uniqueness that any
girl in need of an outfit for a Saturday
night should check out.

Celebrities such as Alicia Keys, J-Lo,
Britney Spears and Pink helped make
Baby Phat famous by sporting sported
the sex kitten attire in some of their
music videos. Any girl who likes that
sparkle, rhinestone, denim and fur look is
recommended to visit this‘ site.

Looking for the romantic, feminine
look? XOXO and Bebe give you shim-
mer, glimmer and oh-so-many rufﬂes in
their collection. The girl going for that
subtle, underrated look should look here

for ideas. Their collections feature butter- .
ﬂy appliques, peasant tops, glitter and

pearls.

By far, probably two of the
most interesting Web sites are
Builtbywendy.com and
Spacecowgirls.com. In
Builtbywendy.com, not only
are guys’ and girls’ clothing
featured, but anyone musically"
talented and hoping to serenade
a crush might want to check.
out their handmade guitar. 
straps. The western— "
Bohemian look comes out
in this collection. ‘

Grab your cowboy hat
and check out the “mean-
est, baddest, low-down
clothin’ line this side of the
Great Divide,”l as featured
in Spacecowgirls.com. The
look is spicy and makes any-
one without a southern accent
wish they had one.

If for some reason
you’re not .a broke college
student, then check out
Girlshop.com and
Purpleskirt.com. They both offer
a retro look for the vintage

  

queens.
These aren’t the .
- only Web sites

 

offering you the look you need to make
your boyfriend or that guy in your psy-
chology class give you a second glance.
There are hundreds out there, but these
are the ones met by the approval of some-
one who wishes Joan Rivers was her
mom. ’

Just in case last week’s win over
Georgetown wasn’t enough, the
Panthers decided to punish the Hoyas

again. « -

A ‘Pitt used a brutal defense that“
included 13 steals to upend the Hoyas

67-56’ before a sold out ‘crowd of 6,798
at Fitzgerald Field House Saturday
afternoon. ' 1

Perhaps a greatdeal of credit for

the victory p can go to the self-pro-\
. claimed .“triple threat” of Julius Page,-
.vBrandin Knight and Jaron Brown.

Knight and Brown each recorded six

steals, coming up just one shy of the
school record» set last season by _

Ricardo Greer. 1

“We are the leaders on the team
and it’s up’ to us to shut them down,”
Page said. “We contested shots and
played solid defense.”

The Panthers shut down the

fifth in the conference in scoring and
led Georgetown in last week’s
matc‘hup with 24 points. He was held
to just six points and was subjected to
heavy double coverage.

wants, but we guard and don’t' let him
get to thebasket,” Pitt center Chevon
Troutman said. A

Braswell in check, holding him to nine

half and opening up a 10-point lead
that was reminiscent of last week’s
contest. But once again, the Panthers
chipped away and entered halftime
trailing by just two, 35-33.

The second half saw the Hoyas go
cold and the momentum switch to the
Panthers, as Page opened the scoring
by nailing a shot from three—point
range that gave Pitt a 36-35 advantage.
Minutes later, a Knight layup put Pitt

up 42-37 and produced a deafening V

roar from the pumped-up crowd.
“This is a great environment‘ for
college basketball,” Pitt head coach

1 Ben Howland said. “It was a help.”

Any chance Georgetown had of
regaining momentum was lost a

"minute later when guard Tony Bethel

had a break away opportunity and
missed a wide open dunk.

“The missed dunkrattled us and
you can’t do that against a good team,”
Georgetown head coach Craig
Esherick said. “It’s no ﬂuke that
they’ve won 18 games.” 1

But the Panthers suffered no such

What happens when the best offense in the Big
East takes on the conference’s stingiest defensive
team? ’ '

You get one heck of a basketball game.

Just ask the sold out crowd that packed Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday to witness Georgetown’s
offense, which averages 82.4 points a game, and Pitt’s
defense, which allows just 57.4 points'a game, duke it
out on the court.

What the crowd saw was the Hoyas’ offense,
which shot 58.3 percent in the first half, come out ﬁr-

Reasons to watchtennis:

Pitt loses late lead,
game to Syracuse

J OE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

The Panthers could probably sum up
Saturday night’s loss to Syracuse with
one word: almost.

Unfortunately, almost only counts
wh'en throwing horseshoes and hand
grenades.

Despite leading by as many as 13
points, the Panthers could not hold on,
falling 75-71 and losing for the ﬁfth
straight game. The loss drops Pitt to 6-13
overall and 1-7 in the conference.

Sharmon Perry led Syracuse with 28

' points, including 12-of-13 from the free-

throw line and 11 rebounds.

Laine Selwyn had a double-double
for Pitt, her fourth in as many games,
scoring 23 points and grabbing 11
rebounds, while Bettina Love added 18
points for the Panthers.

Although Pitt was unable to hold on
for the win, coach Traci Waites found
plenty of positives in defeat.

“I thought we came out and played
hard,” Waites said. “We played better
than we did the last game and I’m happy
about that.”

‘fAs a team, we all played well,”
Selwyn added. “We all were able to con-
tribute, which is what we’ve been lack-
mg.” '

The Panthers held Syracuse to just
28 percent shooting from behind the
three-point line, including just 17 percent
in the ﬁrst half.

But _the difference was free throw
shooting, as Syracuse converted on 19-

of-25, including ﬁve-of—six in the last
minute to put the game away.

“Syracuse is a very good team,”
Selwyn said. “They just beat two ranked
teams and for us to come out and play
like that, it shows that we’re just as
good.”

Pitt started the game strong, jumping
out to a 21-9 lead following a three-
pointer by Selwyn with 12 minutes, 27
seconds left to play in the ﬁrst half.

Syracuse cut the lead down to eight
following baskets by Chineze Nwagbo
and Jazmine Wright, making it 21-13
with 11:32 left in the half.

Pitt responded with consecutive bas-
kets by Selwyn and Jessica Ryndycz to
go back up by 12. Ryndycz ﬁnished with
10 points and ﬁve rebounds before foul-
ing out with 10 seconds left in the game.

The Panthers continued to pour it on,
matching Syracuse basket for basket and
increasing their lead to 13 points with
5:49 left, until the Orangewomen went
on a run of their own.

Syracuse ﬁnished the half with a 16-
6 run, as Perry connected on four free
throws and added three ﬁeld goals to pull
the Orangewomen within three at half-
time, 37-34.

Both teams started the second half
running, but neither team could find
away to score until Syracuse’s Leaf
Newman hit a three to"tie the game at 37
with three minutes gone in the second
half. . V

Tennis about
the play, not
just the outfits

Column, page 16

the sports fan in me to the man in me).

It was pretty easy to root for Hingis
for the ﬁrst hour of the match since she
was ‘dominating Capriati. Hingis frus-
trated Capriati to the point where
Capriati dropped the F-bomb on nation-
al television. Unexpected cursing
always gets my attention. .

So with Hingis up 5-1 in the second
set, I expected Capriati‘ to pack it in and
get out of the heat. It was 90 degrees in
Australia, but it must have like 110
down on the court. »

Capriati didn’t (what an understate-
ment). She fought off four champi-
onship points to come back and win the
second set. Hingis showed the emotion
this time, breaking one racket, then
later throwing another one when
Capriati won the set.

No one else has fought off four
championship points since 1889. I did-
n’t even know they played tennis back
then.

Hingis pretty much gave up in the
third set, but I thought it was amazing
that both athletes ﬁnished the match in
the intense heat. Capriati won the
Australian Open for the second consec-
utive time, and I’m guessing this will be
the match she’ll be remembered for.

Hingis cried on the award stand.
Capriati joked about having had a few
Heinekens the night before the match.

What great play. What drama. What
a weekend to_become a women’s tennis
fan.

I started out the weekend admiring
only a few “aspects” of the game, but I

' ended up liking everything I saw.

seven rebounds.

Troutman, who has been seeing
increased playing time -recently,
recorded a career-high nine points. But
to Howland, the secret to the team’s
success is not individual accomplish-
ments.

“We have a lot of good players
who are unselﬁsh and epitomize the
word ‘team,”’ Howland said. “They
are very mature, care about each other
and are easy to coach because they are
intelligent.”

The Panthers are now 18-3 overall
and 6-2 in the Big East and are closer
to solidifying a ﬁrst round bye in the
Big East Tournament in March. The
Hoyas drop to 12-7 and 3-4 in the con-
ference after being swept by the
Panthers for the ﬁrst time ever.

“Pitt is the best team in the league,
no question,” Esherick said.

While Pitt’s success may be a bit
of a surprise after the Panthers were
chosen to ﬁnish sixth out of seven
teams in the conference’s west divi-
sion, the victories don’t amaze
Howland.

“I thought we’d be 21-0,”
Howland said with a laugh. “To be 18-
3 is pretty special, but we’ve been
expecting to win since game one. I
never expect to lose.”

The Panthers must now prepare to
face the one opponent who beat them
at home this season — Notre Dame.
Pitt will look to avenge Jan. 12’s loss
when it takes on the Irish in South
Bend, Ind., Wednesday night.

“We’re just taking it one game at a
time but we know we’re good and can
win,” Page said. “We think we can beat
anyone in the Big East.”
