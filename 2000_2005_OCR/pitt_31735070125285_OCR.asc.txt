Pitt names new publi heal   dean

he director /of the
nation’s largest aca-
demic environmental

and occupational health program
will become the new, permanent
dean of Pitt’s Graduate School
of Public Health (GSPH) onJune
'1. -

The appointment of Bernard
D. Goldstein as GSPH dean was
announced by Arthur S. Levine,
Pitt senior vice chancellor for
Health Sciences and medical
school dean. . V

“The ﬁeld of public health is

now experiencing a rapid evolu-

' tion, requiring that the dean be a

person with broad and ‘deep ex-
perience in all aspects of public
health education, research and
service, but with the ﬂexibility,
vision and creativity to keep pace

with, and in fact to drive; the-.1
kinetics and shape of this evolu— _ .
' tion, Dr. Goldstein is just such a

person,” Levine wrote in aJan.
23 memorandum to GSPH fac-
ulty, staff and students.

Goldstein, 61, is currently A‘

‘professor and chairperson of the
Department of Environmental
and CommunityMedicine at the
University ofMed.icine and Den-
tistry of New Jersey — Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School

(UMDNJ—RVVJ).

In addition, Goldstein is di— V

rector of the Environmental and
Occupational Health Sciences
Institute, jointly administered by
UMDNJ—RWJ and" Rutgers.
Levine called Goldstein’s insti-
tute “the largest academic envi-

— ronmental and occupational
health program in the United"

States” and said “its multi—disci-
plinary approach includes fac-
ulty -from Dr. Goldstein’s own
department and from ﬁve differ-
ent colleges at Rutgers. Dr._
Goldstein established this insti-
tute as well as the partnership
between the medical school and
Rutgers. He was also the found-
ing dean of UMDNJ’s new
School of Public Health and pre-

sided over its initial accredita-

tion.” ‘

Goldstein’s research has fo-
cusedon biological markers in
risk assessment. He has authored
more than 200 articles and book
chapters on environmental
health_sciences and public policy.

Levine said Goldstein’s ca-_
reer “can be summarized as de-

. veloping multi-disciplinary aca-

demic research programs, in-
cluding basic science, that are
responsive to community needs,

and convincing faculty, policy-

makers and funding ‘agencies of

the value of this approach.”
As public health researchers
acquire new insights into the

human genome — and combine ~

those insights with knowledge
of behavioral and environmen-
tal risks associated with‘ diseases

J — schools such as GSPH gain
"unprecedented opportunities to
improve people’s health,
Goldstein said in a telephone
interview. . .

“I think Pitt is going to be
probably the best of all of them
in applying science to make a
difference in the public’s health,”
Goldstein said. “Pitt has a unique
blend of a strong medical school
and strong, basic public health
programs that will permit us” to
take the leadership role in an

area that could be called genetic

In December, 486 graduate
and ﬁrst-professional students
were enrolled in GSPH. The
school employs 3 09 faculty mem-
bers (including 120 primary and
89 adjunct faculty members, plus

100 with joint appointments in.

other schools), 441 staff and 39
research associates. Goldstein
called GSPH “a superb school”
with no weak or even mediocre
programs. “Of course, there are
always opportunities to improve
what you’re doing,” he added.

Pitt English department
chairperson David Bartholomae,
who serves on the MLA’s Ex-

tenure and protest low wages
paid to teaching assistants (T As)
and adjunct faculty.

“I’m just not convinced that a
ratio of 50 percent is either nec-

Bartholomae, in whose depart-

Comments still acce ted on Pitt

t’s not too late for faculty

and staff to comment.on- '

I the Pitt self—study being
prepared for the University’s cur-
rent accreditation review by the
Middle States Association of
Colleges and Schools.

The 126—page report, called
“Improvement of the Under-
graduate Student Experience:
Setting a Course for the Future,”
describes progress Pitt has made
since the early 1990s academi-
cally and in improving student
life conditions. . -

Vice Provost Elizabeth
Baranger, who chairs Pitt’s
Middle States self—study steer-
ing committee, ‘said the Univer-
sity plans to mail the report to
the Middle States Association in
mid—February. “At this point, we
can’t guarantee that any more
feedback we receive will be in-
cluded in the report itself. But
even if it’s too late to rewrite the
report, our committee welcomes
additional comments, which
would be useful later in the re-

view process.”

Contact the Provost’s ofﬁce
to obtain a copy of the docu-
ment.

For people who have been
around Pitt for several years,
“Improvement of the Under-
graduate Student Experience”
probably won’t provide any star-
tling new facts or insights. Nearly
all of the information has been
reported in earlier Pitt docu-
ments or in the media. For ex-
ample, the document describes
the University’s planning and
budgeting system, which is cred-
ited with making possible the
ﬁnancial reallocations that made
Pitt’s student life improvements
a reality. '

The University Senate’s bud-
get policies committee, one of
several faculty groups that re-
viewed the self—study, called it “a
highly detailed and informative
account of developments at the
University over the past decade
which have had an impact on the
experience of undergraduates.”

UNIVERSITY SEI\IATE

 

IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

I recently read “Beer and Circus,” subtitled
“How Big—time College Sports Is Crippling Un-
dergraduate Education,” by Murray Sperber, a
professor of English at Indiana ‘University in

' Bloomington. I became aware of the book during
’ an interview of Professor Sperber on C-SPAN.
He and his wife had been forced to leave
Bloomington indeﬁnitely after Bob Knight was
ﬁred as Indiana U.’s basketball coach, because
Sperber, who has written several books concerning intercolle-
giate athletics, and his wife had become targetsof threats and
harassment by Knight supporters. _ _
Sperber’s thesis is that second-tier public research universi-
ties, of which Pitt is one, are putting their resources ' into
expanding research and big—time athletics at the expense of
undergraduate education, to increase their standing and prestige
vis—a—vis their competition —— other-second-tier institutions --
and to improvetheir prospects for replacing a ﬁrst—tier institu-
tion. As he sees it, their game plan is based on the belief that it

 

_ is possible to focus on research and NCAA Division I athletics,

while satisfying most undergraduates by entertaining them with
successful, big—time football and basketball programs, and by not

pressing hard to limit their drinking, so that they do not recog— ’

nize, or care, that they’re being short—changed by large lecture_

classes, often taught by non—tenured facultyand graduate stu-‘

dents. .

After reading _Sperber’s book, I decided to attempt to gather
information so I could assess objectively whether Pitt, which is
hardly mentioned“ in the book, is one. of those institutions
Sperber criticizes. Florida State University, Ohio State Univer-
sity and the University of Buffalo, an AAU member, for example,
are prime targets of Sperber. 1 '

It appears that Pitt does’ not have the large number of
undergraduates that many of the “Big—time U.’s” have, and thus
does not generate the volume of revenue from undergraduate
tuition income that others do. Nor does it have a large number
of courses with very high enrollment numbers. Thus, a policy of
exploiting undergraduates for revenue production is not appar-
ent here. Also, Pitt does not fare badly, at least as compared to
other public research institutions, with regard to adverse com-

. ments in Peterson’s Guide, the Princeton Review, the annual

college edition of US." News and the Yale Daily News Insider’s

Guide, on which Sperber, relies for trfatings and comments about .

various universities". However, the Princeton Review’s picture of
undergraduate instruction here indicated a student view that
there is too great use ofteaching assistants in upper—level courses
and poor teaching: 2 i '
Sperber attacks the establishment of honors colleges, of
which Pitt has one. He argues that if there is so much to be gained
from being a student in an honors college because of the
educational experiences provided to their students, such as small
classes, frequent interaction with -tenured faculty, etc., those

beneﬁts should be provided much more broadly throughout the

, undergraduate community, rather than only to a select few.

Sperber points out that mostvstudents in honors colleges receive
scholarships, so that one could say the cost of the honors college
and its students is borne by the very undergraduate students who
are denied the "opportunity to enjoy those ﬁne educational
experiences. ' i

- NCAA Division I—A football and Division I basketball are

seen by Sperber as entertainment for the campus community,

alumni and the general public. They rely on recruited athletes,
rather than on the regular student body. He argues that the
athlete recruitment process has led to unethical conduct by the
institutions through their athletic department staff, cheating by
student athletes, and improper assistance to athletes in their
academic activities at some institutions. Pitt does not have a
record of problems with athletics and athletes like those of public
universities, such as the University of Minnesota, and private
universities, such as Boston College. 2 V .
Sperber ﬁnds big—time athletics a corrupting inﬂuence. ‘He
asserts that big—time football, because expenses for Division I-A
football at most universities exceed the revenue it generates, is a
substantial drain on resources that otherwise could be directed
to undergraduate instruction. As best I can tell, the revenue from
Pi-tt football was less than its cost in ﬁscal year 1999, and the same
was true for men’s basketball.’ In a future piece I plan -to address
the athletics issue at_Pitt in some detail. _ -
I strongly recommend that Pitt board, members, administra-
tors and faculty serving on committees concerned with budget,

_ athletics and instructional matters read Sperber’s book. It can be
i seen as raising a ‘note of caution about the direction this Univer-

sity appears to be taking. . I

Pitt surveys schools to see how  
they measure students’ learning

niversities award

grades and degrees.

But increasingly, par-

ents, employers and legislators

are asking universities: How do

we know your students are actu-
ally learning anything?

“This issue of ‘assessing stu-

dent learning outcomes’ is get-

ting a lot of attention nationally,

as well as at thﬁte and local .

levels,” said Jack L. Daniel, Pitt

_ vice provost for Academic Af-

fairs.

Since December, Daniel has
amassed stacks of documents
from Pitt schools and regional
campuses, ‘describing how they
assess undergraduate students’

learning and skills.

Daniel requested the data in]

his capacity as chairperson of the

University’s Enrollment‘ Man— ’

agement Advisory ‘Committee.
He concluded that ea’ch.Pitt aca-
demic responsibility center has
an effective system for assessing
student learning, or is working
on one. —

“It varies by unit,” Daniel
said. “Professional schools —"-—
engineering, nursing, informa-
tion sciences, CBA [the College
of Business Administration] -
have very formal standards for
assessment that are part of the

schools’ accreditation processes.

The arts and sciences, our most

complex unit, is at the beginning
of thinking through how they’re
going to do it.

“I wanted to make sure that
each unit either had a learning

‘assessment system in place or

was making plans for one,” he
said. “Now that I’m satisﬁed
that’s the case,_ we [Provost’s of-

ﬁce staff] aren’t going to inter— '

fere in how it’s actually being
done at the school level. It’s up
to the faculties of the schools to
articulate what they’re doing.”
Daniel noted that a section
on learning assessment is in-
cluded in the Pitt self—study re-

port being prepared for the
‘University’s current accredita-

tion review by the Middle States
Association of Colleges and
Schools. See Middle States update
on page 2. I V
“At the University level,”
Pitt’s Middle States report says,
“assessment takes the form of
student attitude and satisfaction
surveys, broad assessments. of
student achievement, ongoing
academic program evaluations,
and review and approval of new
academic program initiatives.
“At the unit level,” the Middle

States report continues, “schools '

and campuses are responsible for
assessing student achievement
within their coursework, evalu-
ating student satisfaction with
unit-level services, and review-
ing and modifying curricula to
keep pace with student needs
and the demands of each disci-
pline. Iii addition, many of the

units within the University main- '

tain regular compliance with

dozens of discipline—speciﬁc ac-
crediting bodies, whose assess-
ment requirements typically ex-
ceed those of the general educa-
tion program.” ‘

Vice -Provost for. Graduate
Studies Elizabeth U. Baranger,
whochairs Pitt’s Middle States
self-study committee, said most
Pitt ‘schools require seniors to
take “capstone” courses, which
often review material covered in
previous courses. By passing
capstone courses, students show
that they have acquired at least
the basic knowledge and skills
required for their degrees. _

Baranger said the University
has ruled out mandatory, make-
or—bre'ak senior exams, which
some private schools require stu-
dents to pass in order to gradu-
ate. Such exams wouldn’t be
practical at a complex institution
such as Pitt, she said.

National media coordinator hired
to increase Umvers1ty’s Visibility

11 1990, the head of public
relations at Syracuse Uni-
versity hired John D. Har-
vith to raise Syracuse’s then-

modest proﬁle in the national

media. .

By the end. of the decade,
Syracuse was scoring thousands
of “media hits” annually in A-list
publications such as The New
YorkTimes, on national TVand

radio, and through Internet news _

outlets.

On'March 1, Harvith will

begin work at Pitt in the new
position of assistant vice chan-
cellor -for national media rela-
tions.

His new boss-to—be, Pitt Ex-
ecutive Director of Public Af-
fairs Robert Hill, has high hopes

that Harvith will now help to‘

shine the national media spot-
light toward Pitt.

No surprise there. It was Hill
who, as Syracuse’s vice president
for public relations in 1990, re-
cruited Harvith to that school.

“VVhat we’d like, frankly, are '

thousands of, positive appear-
ances of the University of Pitts-

burgh in the national media an-

nually, apart from coverage of
Pitt athletics,” Hill said.

How many appearances does
Pitt enjoy currently?

“Well, let’s put it this way:
not as many as we’d like,” Hill
replied.

According to_the Pitt news
release announcing his hiring,
Harvith will direct a national
news program aimed at “sub-
stantially raising the University’s

positive visibility in the major.
national media. His responsibili— ’

strategy for institutional reputa-
tionjmanagement, and develop-
ing and placing national stories
that demonstrate the Uni-
versity’s excellence in research,

g education and regional develop-

ment.” ,

“This is not work for sissies,”
Hill said. “There are onlya hand-
ful of men and women inAmerica
who can do this work effectively,
with accountability and measur-
able effectiveness, and John
Harvith is the best among that
handful.”

Directing a successful na-
tional media relations operation
requires a unique “package of
competencies,” Hill said: the in-
telligence to comprehend some-
times—esoteric research and the
skill to summarize it in clear
English; the insight to differen-
tiate between stories with na-
tional_appeal and those of local
or regional interest only; aggres-
SivenessﬂndiWh¢n.appropri%!te.
patience)"in pitchin stories; tact
in editing faculty-written op-ed
pieces, and charm and candor in
cultivating contacts among the
media as well as within the Uni-
versity.

Today’s national media rela-
tions director also must be
Internet—savvy, Hill added. “The
most powerful communication
medium known to humankind is
the Web. Clearly, it is the me-
dium of choice /for many of our

potentialstudents. [Harvith] will .

work with members of our com-
munications team to package the
University of Pittsburgh on the
Web in ways that are appealing
and inviting, especially to people
aged 18 to 22.”

Hill said it is extremely rare‘ ,

for anindividual to possess all of
the abilities he cited — “but
Harvith has them.” ,
Harvith, 54, said his guiding
principles are “to do your back-
ground research, to know that
you have solid stories and then
to approach media people with
an eye toward meeting their

needs. I’ve worked hard to main-“

tain my credibility with editors
and reporters on the national
level by not wasting their time. I

. _ only approach them when I feel

I have something that is truly of
national interest.” ‘

~ Ray Walker, deputy editor
for Knight Ridder/Tribune
News Service in Washington,
D.C., said of Harvith: “VVhen
John calls, he has credibility. I

g always take time to listen to story

ideas he has to offer because,
even if we can’t always use them,
they’re very good ideas.”
Harvith said he will spend his
first few months at Pitt meeting
people and “looking for ways to
get national publicity that maybe

people there haven’t thought of
before.” v T
National media relations is
“a different game” from the 10-
cal kind, he said. “Actually, at
Syracuse, Robert Hillwas among
the first people to envision this

as something separate from the _

regular news operation of an in-
stitution. That was almost un-
heard of back in 1990, although

cluded interviews with 46 re-
cording ﬁgures, among them

Aaron Copland, Benny

The Harviths’ exhibition of _

Struss photographs toured coast
to coast. In 1995, CBS—TV’s
“Sunday Morning” featured the
Harviths as the rediscoverers of
Struss. '

Since 1997, the Harviths have
interviewed more than 50 TV
pioneers for Syracuse’s Center
for the Study of Popular Televi-
sion.

“I feel very strongly that, in

the line of work that I’m in, it is

irnportantto maintain an aca-

museum,” Harvith recalled.

As a boy, Harvith began col-
lecting records by the William
Steinberg—led Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Orchestra. VVhile Harvith
was working at Oberlin College,
he and his wife would visit Pitts-
burgh on weekends for concerts
and art exhibits.

Before going to Syracuse,
Harvith worked in public rela-

' tions at the University of Cali-

fornia at Santa Cruz, Oberlin
College, Interlochen Center for
the Arts, and the University of
Michigan. He also has served as
Michigan correspondent for
High Fidelity/Musical America,
and as music critic for the Ann

Arbor News. '

momentum as you proceed. I’ve

“Typically, national media
work gets folded in with other
work in an information ofﬁce.
Too often, with the push and
shove of everyday local crises,
[national media work] takes a
back seat.

“It’s a gradual process,”
Harvith continued. “You build
momentum as you proceed. I’ve,

" developed a fair number of con-

tacts over the years, and I’ll let

them know that I’m transferring 
to the University of Pittsburgh. ”

In addition to carrying over
contacts, Harvith plans to con-
tinue as a ﬁlm, photography,
music and television historian.
He and his wife, Syracuse ad-
junct professor Susan Edwards
Harvith, have co—authored two
books: “Karl Struss: Man with a
Camera,” which rediscovered the
earlystill photography of the leg-
endary Hollywood cinematog-
rapher; and “Edison, Musicians,

demic, cultural, intellectual life,”
Harvith said. “It helps, when I’m
working with ournalists and fac-
ulty members, for them. to real-
ize’ that I’m not just someone
who’s acting as a marketing
agent, that my wife and I do
research of our own.”

Susan Edwards Harvith’s
teaching commitments will keep
her at Syracuse for the time be-
ing, but the Harviths are hoping
Pitt will offer her a faculty posi-
tion in ﬁlm and television his-
tory.

Harvith’s maternal grandpar-

ents immigrated from Austria-

Hungary to Brownsville, P.a., at
the turn of the 20th century.
Later, the family moved to
McKeesport. “I have fond
memories of Pittsburgh from
when I was 9 years old and spent
part of a summer with relatives
there. I asked to stay longer be-
cause I was enjoying it so much.

Harvith earned his A.B. in
music history with high distinc-
tion, Phi Beta Kappa, from the
University of Michigan, and a
_].D. from the University of
Michigan Law School. ,

He also has studied piano at
the University of Michigan, the

UNIVERSITY TIMES

A critically ill woman lies in the _

intensive care unit, a tube trailing

‘ from her mouth.

Her throat itches and shetries to
scratch it, disturbing the tube that
helps sustain her life. .

Due to the tube, she’s unable to
give voice to the problem.

A nurse enters the room. “Are
you in pain?”

The woman shakes her head, no,
but has no way to convey the source
of her discomfort. ’

The nurse, concerned that the
patient will remove the tube, re-
strains the woman ’s hands.

Cl

“A voiceless patient is a vul-
nerable patient,” says Mary Beth
Happ, assistant professor in the
acute/tertiary care department
at Pitt’s School of Nursing.

Happ, who is trainedas a clini-
cal care nurse specialist, came to
Pitt last fall, following doctoral
and post-doctoral fellowship
work at the University of Penn-
sylvania. Her research there fo-
cused on criticallyill older adults
and their responses to technolo-

ies. -

“By technologies I mean the
hardware we practitioners rely
on to understand the micro—pro-
cesses that are going on in the
critical care patient and how to
treat those,” she says. “I’m inter-
ested in patients’ responses to
technology in a critical care set-
ting, what I call the interaction
ofthe technology-nurse-patient
triad.”

She says her work is particu-

larly concerned with the prob-
lem that nurses face with pa-
tients removing the tubesthat
keep them alive or aid in their
care.

Building on her dissertation
and post—doc work, Happ is re-

searching communication pat-
terns in the intensive care unit.

“I would like to improve com-
munication for all patients who
are unable to speak in the ICU.
They’re unable to speak because
of the technologies we use to
save their lives, such as breath-
ing tubes. Support studies in this
area clearly show that we aren’t
doinga good enough job at syinp—
tom relief in the end-of—life care
setting.”

At Pitt, Happis principal in-
vestigator for two feasibility stud-
ies testing an augmentative com-
munication device. One of the
studies, funded by the American
Association of Critical Care
Nurses/Sigma Theta Tau. (the
international nursing honorary
society), focuses on temporarily
voiceless patients in critical care.

It is a necessarily small study

(10 patients), she says, because ,

few patients in intensive care have
both the cognitive abilities and
the physical strength to commu-
nicate.

“It’s not targeted to dying
patients only, though a certain
percentage of them are dying. If

“a person is that sick, they often

lose some cognitive ability, al-

though we don’t know to what ;

extent because we can’t talk to
them,” Happ says.

“Critical care practitioners
use various means‘ to communi-
cate, but the repertoire is small
and limited to yes—no kinds of
responses. Patients can’t gener-
ate new messages and ask what
they want or need, they can only
respond.”

Happ is testing the feasibility
of the Dyna Mite device, manu-
factured by Dynavox Systems
Inc., whose programmers have

helped custorriize the options and

Pitt investigating use of
gene therapy as pain relief

n the last six years, Pitt clini-
cal investigators have ap-
plied gene therapies to
health problems ranging from
arthritis to cancer. This month,
the University received a $14.3
million, ﬁve-year grant to treat

cardiovascular diseases using"

gene therapy.

Yet another prpmising use of
gene therapy —- one that could
beneﬁt a wide variety of patients
—— is in treating pain.

I In experiments with animals,
Pitt researchers have blocked
pain by using viral vectors (agents
that carry genes into cells) to
transmit natural, opiate-like pro-
teins called enkephalins.

Joseph Glorioso, chairperson
of the molecular genetics and
biochemistry department at Pitt;

.explained: “In the spinal cord,-

there are receptors for pain—caus—
ing stimulae. VVhen these recep-_
tors sense stimulae such as in-
tense heat, for- example, they
stimulate neurons that send‘ a
pain-transmitting signal to the
brain. ' A

‘ “Well, there are natural en-
kephalin-producing neurons in
the spinal cord which, under cer-

4

tain circumstances, get a signal
from the brain to make enkepha-

lin. This enkephalin‘ binds to‘

opiate receptors on pain-trans-

mitting neurons, and blocks or ,

dampens the transmission of pain
signals. 

“In our experiments, we’ve
used viruses like the herpes virus
as vectors, to carry enkephalins
into the pain-transmitting neu-
rons. This blocks the pain trans-
mission.” . t

Enkephalins are as effective
as morphine in killing pain. But
unlike morphine, enkephalins
are produced naturally by the
body and don’t alter the brain,
Glorioso noted. Also, the body
does not develop a tolerance for

enkephalins, so there is norisk»

of addiction, he said.

“We’re currently testing this
therapy in primates. I would
guess‘ that within a year and a

. half, we’ll be ready to test this in‘ -

patients _in a Phase 1 clinical

trial,” Glorioso predicted.
“This is going to be great for

patients-with conditions that pro-

duce severe pain, such as bone

cancer,” he said.

After pushing three buttons,
the patient has described a par-
ticular problem that might have

takena much longer time to get

at through gestures or yes-no
responses. 1 ' -
“Generally speaking, the de-
vice offers limited options to"
avoid confusion,” Happ said.
“But higher levels allow patients,
who are able, to generatestheir
own questions.-Do they want to
see a particular family member,
for example.” ' i
The device, which has a 7-
inch—square screen, can be
mounted on an IV pole for pa-

in tient access. It features w.ord,pre—

diction capabilities and displays
words that typically begin ques-
tions.— do,.will, can — to help
limit the number of key strokes a
patientwould require to form a
sentence.

Happ says the device has been i

used with voiceless adults and
children for years, butnever in
the critical care genvironrrient.
She says, so far, there has been
only limited success. “I’m ﬁnd-
ing that these -patients are so
weak, even touching a screen is a

, great, time—consuming effort.

There is also the issue of cogni-
tive load; -many patients suffer

of the actions of potent medica-
tions, sedation or just the-physi-

I ology of critical illnesses.

ments rather than replaces other

forms of communication, such I

as pencil and paper at bedsides.

. Part of her study will mea—_.

I vention plan that I’m hoping to

build. That’s really the point of
this research.” ‘

Happ acknowledges that the
device may have more applica-

.bility for other populations of

patients, where cognitive and
physical limitations are less at
issue. i

'“I have funding from the

I Oncology Nursing Society to do

the same kind“ of feasibility test-
ing with post-operative neck and
throatcancer patients. They of-
ten do end up getting voice pros-
theses for speech, but immedi-
ately during post—op, there may
be swelling, for example.”

In both stud-ies, Happ has
permission_ from Pitt’s institu-
tional review board to testthe
devices, but since they are not
Food and Drug Administration-
approved for hospital use, she
also must secure patients’ con-
sent. ,

“They sign a- consent form
or, if they are not able to, the

. family signs. And we do want to

get family consent, because we

want to observe family/patient

A‘ communication as well,” she says.

“This research will provide im-
portant data about whether the

' devices are useful. ‘I don’t know

of any particular risks, and I
haven’t found any resistance to
using them. Nurses and physi-
cians have been open to it, too.”

Happ says she’s‘ begun col-
laborating with faculty at Pitt’s
medical school and the Center

for Bioethics and Health Law,

where she holds a secondary ap-
pointment, to develop a com-
prehensive communication plan
for end-of—life care.

“I foun ' my dissertation
research, whic was a longitudi-
nal study of 16 critically ill el-
ders, that any non—verbal behav-
ior was a communicative behav-
ior. Even the behavior of pulling

out the tubes, in the broadest-

sense, was a mode of communi-
cation. Patients would remove
their tubes to summon the nurse
because they knew they would
get-quicker attention than using
the call’ button. Patients may be
communicating pain or agitation
or delirium. I became aware of

the patterns during the inter— ‘

vening process when patients
were voiceless. And I’m con-
cerned that we aren’t enabling

communication, particularly in

the last stages of life.”

_ Happ’s research informs her
teaching, too, she says. She
teaches ethics in nursing and ’

health care, a required under-
graduate course in Pitt’s nursing

sues involving end—of—life care, ,

cedures and communication in- .

» Sabine von Dirke, chairper-
son of Germanic languages, and
literatures, pointed out: “VVhen
you begin to study a language,
it’s very important that you be
exposed to the language every
day, at least Monday through
Friday, which represents ﬁve
credit hours.” B

Von Dirke and Beverley said
that, in a typical semester, more
than half of their departments’
courses are taught by tenured or
tenure-stream faculty. But more
credits are taught by TAs, in-
structors and part—timers because
those are the people who teach
the‘ higher-"—enrolled, 5—credit
entry—level courses.

In contrast, Pitt non—West-
ern language departments fare
better under the MLA formula.

That’s because even entry—level

courses here in Chinese, Japa-

nese and Russian tend to be
taught by tenured/tenure—track
professors with help from TASe
who are native speakers of those
languages. V I -

David]. Birnbaum, chairper-
son of Slavic languages and lit-
eratures, explained: “These are
more difﬁcult languages for most
Westerners to learn, and incom-
ing students are less likely to

- have studied them in high school

than, say, Spanish or French.
“That’s why, unlike in some_

’ otherlanguage departments, our

ﬁrst-year, 5—credit courses are
often taught by tenured‘ profes-

‘ sors and have low enrollments.”

Dayle Barnes and David
Mills, coordinators of Pitt’s Chi-

. nese andjapanese language pro-
grams, respectively, said virtu-

. ally all of their programs’_ lan-
e guage courses are taught by ten-

ured/tenure-track professors
with TAs in supporting roles.

Arts and Sciences Dean Coo-
per commented: “I certainly be-
lieve that we should have as many
courses as feasible, taught by ten-
ured and tenure-stream -faculty.
But I also think that graduate

students, as teaching assistants’

and teachingfellows, have a very
important role in the’ curricu-
lum. ‘ I ‘

“The MLA vote was a rather
blunt instrument that lumped
TAs, TF5, part—time faculty and
full-time, non—tenured faculty all
together, when in fact those are
very different sorts of contribu-
tors to the curriculum.”

The MLA resolution was

motivated largely by concerns
that tenured professors who re-
tire or resign are being replaced
by non—tenure-stream faculty.
But according to Dean Cooper
and Bartholomae of the English
department, MLA voters didn’t
take into account initiativessuch

as one in the arts and sciences
— that has consolidated part—time
teaching positions into full-time .

ones.“ . «
“In our department,”

‘Bartholomae said, “it is true that

there are more full—time, non-
tenure—stream lines than there,
were in the past. It is not true that
tenure-stream positions have
beentranslated into non—tenure-
stream positions.”

In fact, he said, the new full-
time, non-tenure-track jobs were
created by merging part-time
positions. “These new, full-time

positions offer better salaries,

F beneﬁts and more assurance of

continued employment than the
previous part-time jobs,”
Bartholomae said. i

He also ‘noted that, for de-
cades, the English department
has. employed professional jour-
nalists to teach ‘newspaper and
magazine courses.

“We rely on them because

they’re excellent teachers, they;

bring real-world experience to
the classroom, and it’s economi-
cally beneficial to the institution

I to hire them, usually on a one

course—per—term basis,” Bartho-
lomae said. .
“It’s fundamentally wrong,”

he added, “to assume that the ,

quality of teaching is compro-
mised by the presence of non-

New center revolutionizing way

education students learn to teach

F been analyzing film as
Cleveland Browns owner Paul
Brown started doing it in the
late—1940s. ‘

Today, as sophisticated video
capability becomes more com-
mon in the classroom, informa-
tion technology is revolutioniz-
ing the way prospective teachers
are taught to teach, according to
Pitt School of Education Dean
Alan Lesgold.

“A student can go out and use
a low-end camera, take some
video in a classroom situation,
bring it back and talk about it in
a class,” Lesgoldsaid. “Or a su-
pervising teacher could go out
and film a. little bit of teaching
activity by one of our MAT stu-
dents or professional-year stu-
dents doing an internship and
thereby better connect the prac-
tical sideof teaching with the
theory side.” ,

Lesgold spoke Jan. 18 at the
dedication of, the education
school’s new Computer and Cur-

riculum Inquiry Center (CCIC).

The CCIC, located in room.

4B52 Posvar Hall, features 32
work stations equipped with

Apple G4 series I multi—media ‘

computers, financed by a
$650,000 capital campaign gi.ft
to the school from the Buhl
Foundation. V

“By putting these kinds of
tools in the School of Education,
where the teachers of the future
and those who teach those teach-
ers and those who do research in
education can use them, our goal

ootball coaches have ,

a teaching tool since

is not simply to make their lives
easier in doing what they always
did,” Lesgold said. “Rather, we
hope to leverage the informa-
tion technologies to change the
very”structure of the scholarly
enterprise and the learning en-
terprise.”

Lesgold said the center’s digi-
tal video component, particu-
larly, will help bridge the well-
acknowledged gap between
teaching practice and educational
theory.

“Anyone who is been involved
with education for more than

about 30 minutes has heard

somebody complain that they
take all these dry courses that
really have nothing to do with
teaching,” he said. “Our goal in
using video technology is exactly
the goal of changing the human
enterprise, in which the connec-
tions between the classroom and
student teaching experiences,
already strong, will be made even
stronger and more concrete and
direct.”

Susan Pittman, director of
technology and media services
at the education school, demon-
strated some of the center’s work-
station features at the dedication
ceremony. “VVhen we talk about

multi—media capability we mean '

more than words,” Pittman said.
“We mean photographs, short
movies, animation, interactive
conferencing, digital editing,_
camcorder compatibility, special
effects, zoom-in features, soft-
ening and sharpening focus, au-
dio capability, music, titles.
“You can download things
from the web; record your own

voice—over; create your own little
movie. You can take your movie
home and watch it on your VHS
tape player. You can e-mail it to
a colleague or friend.”

The Mac dual processor, 5 00.

megahertz G4 series is the latest
Apple has to offer, Pittman said.
“It’s got 256K memory, a zip
drive, a digital port so you can
attach your digital cameras, a
hard drive_scanner, a port to at-
tach camcorders, and DVD—ram
drive,” among other features.
Lesgold . cautioned that no
revolution takes place over night.
“I want to emphasize that
we’re just getting started,” he
said. “But if we ask ourselves the

 

question: What would be the
ideal way the let someone learn
to teach? Well, if technology is
part of teaching, then technol-
ogy ought to infuse everything
that teachers are exposed to. And
we want cooperating teachers in
the classroom, right from the
beginning, to know something
about technology.

“But faculty need time and
training to take full and continu-
ing advantage of the ways of or-
ganizing scholarly programs that
information technology affords.
I want to thank the Buhl F oun-
dation for helping us make this
important first step possible.”

. Doreen Boyce, Buhl Foun— _

dation director, said that the
foundation’s mission is to sup-
port education at all levels.

when I visited schools, I found

classrooms; I occasionally see
teachers who have imaginatively
and creatively used them, but
not always. I think you do have
some work to do and I’m de-
lighted that this school has taken
on the challenge. We at the Buhl

. Foundatfon are very proud to be
' partners in that.” . --

Boyce also is a School of Edu-
cation alumna, earning her doc-
torate in 1983.

Some of the Buhl money will
to used to create an archival da-
tabase that will track student in-
formation, including applica-
tions, admissions, registration,
enrollment and graduation rates.

Lesgold also said the school
planned to develop smaller
multi-media labs in anticipation
of the increase in demand by
faculty to use information tech-
nologies in their teaching.

“Our goal is to have a_ num-
ber of flexible spaces that allow
us to do classroom activities -and
other learning activities, that take

advantage of information tech-

nology tools,”’ Lesgold said.
“There is a lot of demand on this
kind of space. In tod_ay’s class-
rooms, demand for students to

be sitting at computers while

they’re in a classroom has risen,
pushingoutstudents who needed
the computers for analysis for

‘ their dissertation and educational , A

research, and things of that sort.”
As an example, the dean
pointed to the CCIC’s anteroom,

at 16-station facility using Win— '

dows platforms: “This ‘smaller
facility is well—suited to advanced
methodology classes,” he said.
“We want to have lots of differ-
ent sized spaces that would have
intensive and continual use.”

INCLEMENT WEATHER 
PERMIT PARKING

t In order to better serve our permit parkers, the University
Parking Office requests that personnel with permits in surface lots
utilize the Soldiers and Sailors Garageor the .O’Hara Garage on
days when snow makes the lots difficult to access- Arrangements‘
with garage attendants have been made for permit parkers on these

days.

Please do not use any open lots after midnight if snow begins 0
to accumulate. Your cooperation will assist Facilities Management
in clearing the lots of snow and ice in a timely manner. "

A If you have any questions concerning these arrangements
please call the Parking Office during business hours Monday.—
Thursday, 8:00 a.m’.—5:30.p.m., Friday 8:00 a.m.—5:00 pm.‘
at 624-4034. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

PPG fimds chemistry lab-

Faculty and students in Pitt’s ‘

chemistry department have pow-

‘erful new tools to explore the

composition of materials, thanks
to a $500,000 gift fr_om the PPG
Industries, Inc., Foundation to
create the PPG Materials Char-
acterization Laboratory.

The PPG Foundation admin-
isters the charitable giving of
PPG Industries," a global sup-

plier of coatings, chemicals, glass I

and fiber glass.

Pitt and PPG ofﬁcials dedi-
cated the lab last month.

“This generous gift from

“PPG strengthens the partner--

ship between PPG and Pitt’s
chemistry department that is
symbolized by the number of
our graduates who work at PPG, ”

said N. John Cooper, dean of .f
Arts-and Sciences. “The gift will .

help the department to maintain
its 125—year tradition of scien-
tiﬁ_c excellence, a tradition that

depends critically on cutting-

edge research facilities.”

‘‘We’re delighted to support
chemistry education and re-
search because these ‘ﬁelds of
knowledge play a vital role in our
success,” said Gerald W. Gruber,
vice president of science and
technology, PPG Industries.

Three instruments highlight
the new PPG materials labora-
tory: an X—ray diffractometer, an
atomic force microscope (AFM)
and a fluorescence system.

The X—ray diffractometer is
used in characterizing organic
and inorganic molecules, includ-
ing high-temperature supercon-
ducting materials and biologi-
cally important molecules. Re-
searchers used X—ray diffraction
to determine the structure of
DNA.

The  functions much as .
. an old-fashioned record player,
i where a sharp tipmovies across a '

bumpy surface to generate an
electrical signal describing the
topography of the surface. The

AFM is being used to image the

surfaces of muscle tissues and

new polymerstructures that en- .

able nanotechology.

The recently installed ﬂuo— «

rescence system will be used by
researchers working on biologi-
cally active compounds.

PPG Foundation also helped
to establish a laser laboratory for
materials research. Under the
direction of chemistry professor
Sanford Asher, laser laboratory

experiments cover a diverse _

range of materials research
projects, including identifying
and establishing the laws of pro-
tein folding, characterizing non-
linear optical materials used in
developing optical switches and

- ordering photonic crystals used

_for chemical sensing.

The PPG Foundation sup-
port is part ofPitt’s $500 million
capital campaign. . — I

Gunduz Caginalp, profes-

sor of mathematics, has been -

named the Maytag Family Foun-
dation Scholar for 2001 in rec-
ognition of his work on math-
ematical analysis of experimen-
tal asset markets. The work was
done in collaboration with Dave
Porter and Vernon Smith "of the
University of Arizona.
Caginalp, Porter and Smith
also received an award for 2001-

2002 from the Dreman Founda- .-

tion through the International
Foundation for Research in Ex-.
perimental Economics to con-
duct additional research in this
area.

In November, Caginalp was
named editor of The Journal of

Psychology and Financial Mar-’

kets. ,

Christopher C. Capelli has

been named director of technoI— —

ogy management effective
March 1. He succeeds Arthur A.
Boni, who is retiring from the
University on that date. I
Capelli joined Pitt’s Ofﬁce of
Technology Management in
September 1999 as technology
licensing manager. In that ca-

, pacity, he has been one of the

lead negotiators in‘ the licensing

. activities of the University.

A 1982 graduate of Massa-

chusetts Institute of Technol-

ogy (MIT) with a BS. in me-
chanical engineering, Capelli
earned his M.D. from the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin Medical
School in 1989, and he has a
medical license in the State of
Wisconsin.

He has been involved with
hi gih-technology startup compa-
nies both as a scientist and as a
businessman since graduating
from MIT. As a result of his
scientiﬁc work, Capelli holds
over 2 0 patents and patent appli-
cations ‘worldwide, and he has
been involved directly in the

startup of numerous biomedical '0

company ventures.

Provost James Maher said:
“Technology transfer is a major
area of emphasis for the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, and Dr.
Capelli has the combination of
education and experience that
will allow him to build on the
foundation that has been estab-
lished by Art Boni. We are con-

ﬁdent that our ever growing ef- _,

forts in this endeavor will result
in signiﬁcant benefits, not only
for the University, but also for
the entire region.”

Maher added that the Uni-
versity expects to see a number
of products originating in its
laboratories on the market in the
coming years.

Boni established the Ofﬁce
of Technology Management
when he joined Pitt in 1996. His
appointment reflected the major
commitment made by the Uni-
versity to exploit the commer-
cial potential of its scientiﬁc dis-
coveries and to make a signiﬁ-
cant contribution to the eco-
nomic development of the re-
gion._ .
During the ﬁve years that

Boni served as_ director, inven—'

tion disclosures and patents
tripled, the University entered
into over 100 licenses and op-
tions for its technologies with
corporate partners, and an eq-
uity portfolio -of 16 startup and
emerging companies has been

I developed. Additionally, the Of-

ﬁce of Technology Manage-
ment, in partnership with the
Katz Graduate School of _Busi—

ness, launched a new program —— -

Katz Tech Fellows — to assist
emerging technology—based
companies with MBA-trained
technology management exper-
tise. «

Personality
trait may
affect response
of immune
system - 4

Individuals may vary in how
well theycan protect themselves
from illness, depending on per-
sonality traits as well as on physi-

ological differences, results of a

preliminary study suggest.
Anna L. Marsland, of the
Behavioral Medicine Program at
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic, and colleagues tested

‘how participants responded to a

vaccine for the viral infection
known as hepatitis—B. This vac-
cination“ prompts an . immune

/system defense by introducing a
tiny amount of the infectious

agent into the body.

The study participants also
were given a test to measure a
personality trait called negative
affect,.or neuroticism. Individu-
als with high scores’ on tests of
negative affect tend to be moody,
nervous and easily stressed.

Those study participants with
higher scores on the neuroti-
cism test also tended to have
lower immune system responses
to the hepatitis vaccine, Marsland
and colleagues found. .

“The present ﬁndings sup-
port a link between trait nega-
tive affect and an objective health
measure '—.iantibody response to
vaccination — raising the possi-
bility that individuals high in trait

_negative affect or- neuroticism

may have less protectiveimmune
responses,” said Marsland.
Study participants were asked
to give a speech in order to mea-
sure their physiological re-
sponses to stress. Their immune
functions were reduced some-
what as a result of the speech -
those who had a lower immune
response to __-the vaccination
showed the most reduction.
Those who had a lower im-
mune response may be more vul-
nerable-to the effects of stress or
to the effects of a personality
trait like neuroticism and there-

' fore be more vulnerable to dis-

ease. “This study provides initial
evidence that individual differ-
ences in the magnitude of stress-
induced reduction of immune
function may be of clinical sig-
nificance,” said Marsland. I

Pitt has ‘received a $1.6 mil-
lion grant from the National In-
stitute on Disability and Reha-
bilitation Research (NIDRR) to
establish a model center on spi-
nal cord injury.

The center will conduct re-
search into a new generation of
wheelchairs and assistive devices
to improve mobility and inde-
pendence for persons with spi-
nal cord injuries. The new cen-
ter, called the University of Pitts-
burgh Model Center on Spinal
Cord Injury (UPMC—SCI), is the
first of its kind for this region.»

“Paralysis as a result of spinal
cord injury remains one of the
most elusive injuries to cure and
most expensive to treat,” said
Michael Boninger, associate pro-
fessor, Department of Physical
Medicine and Rehabilitation.

“For the 2 50,000 individuals
who are living with spinal cord
injuries in the United States,
costs for hospitalization, assistive
technology and home adapta-
tion can exceed $1 million over a
lifetime.

“Through this model center,
we hope to take the next step
forward in helping spinal cord-
injured patients achieve‘ and
maintain as much independence
as possible.” _
