Chancellor Posvar
remembered as
friend and mentor

EUGENE CROSS
The Pitt News

Several hundred people braved the cold and rain yesterday to
pay their respects to Chancellor Wesley Wentz Posvar, who passed
away July 27.

Posvar served as Pitt’s 15th chancellor from 1967 until his
retirement in 1991, arriving at the University after a highly success-
ful career in the Air Force where he served as a pilot and eventual-
ly achieved the rank of brigadier general.

The memorial service took place at Heinz Chapel and featured
speakers included Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, former head foot-
ball coach John Majors and several members of Posvar’s family.

“Chancellor Posvar, and those working with him, literally trans-
formed the University. For most of us who knew him, he was a
leader, a mentor and a friend,” Nordenberg said.

Trustee Emeritus Wﬂliarn Rea said that when Posvar arrived at‘ .

Pitt in 1967, the University was on the verge of ﬁnancial ruin.

Rea, who served as chair of Pitt’s Board of Trustees from 1967
to 1978, praised Posvarfs ability to handle Pitt’s ﬁnancial troubles.

“He paid off the debt in about three years,” Rea said. _

Posvar held ﬁve degrees including a master’s in public affairs
and a Ph.D. in political science, which he received from Harvard
University. He also won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University
and was the ﬁrst Air Force ofﬁcer awarded this honor. '

“As a friend, Wes was loyal. He displayed a passionate com-
mitment to social service,” said Pitt Professor Emeritus and ﬁiend
Dr. Jack Freeman. Posvar was also

known as a loyal football fan. He met "1 W05‘f0’'1Wat€ 10 W0Tk
s with the new football recruits every - With the man Whose heart

year. ' was as wide as the world

“W68 W35 fully C0mII1itt6d t0 the and whose soul was as

football program,” said former coach high as the sky ~

John Majors. He said Posvar loved to

show off his collection of charnpi- .

onship and bowl-garne watches. —Pitt Provost Emeritus

Majors said by the end of Posvar’s Donald Henderson

tenure as chancellor he had enough
tonmthelengthofbotharms.  "W
“He absolutely cherished the title that was put upon him as

I » Pitt’s number one fan,”Freeman said

When Nicholas Dean Rossi, the late chancellor’s son-in-law,

' stood to speak, he fought back tears while describing Posvar.

“Wesley Posvar came to  looking_for a challenge and
found a whole new -life,”_he‘ said; _ A » ~;.j‘-:  . .

Rossi spoke about the controversy that plagued Posvar in his
ﬁnal months as chancellor, when, according to news reports from
the time, the chancellor was awarded a hefty retirement package.

Rossi said that the controversy surrounding Posvar’s retirement
was very painful. '

“In fact it tortured him,” he said, referring to the criticism his
father-in-law faced from students and faculty.

night’s celebration of Banned Books Week at the Carnegie Library in Oakland.

Banned books

Local celebrities put the #*&! back into reading

RENEE ALBERTS
Staff Writer

A crowd gathered to celebrate explicit lan-
guage, sexual content and morally offensive sub-
ject matter ﬁlled the Gillespie Room of the
Carnegie Library in Oakland. Last night, the
ACLU and the»Oakland branch of the Carnegie
Library presented’ the “Read No Evil?” presenta-
tion in honor of Banned Books Week. -

The presentation opened with a disclaimer
warningof explicit content. Several local celebri-
ties read excerpts from their favorite barmed for
challenged books. The event’s ﬂier encouraged
guests to join “in the ﬁght against censorship” and
to “celebrate your freedom to read, speak, create
and express.” '

The ﬁrst speaker, Tom Sokolowski, director of,
the‘ Andy Warhol Museum, said he chose to read
excerpts from the Koran because he feels it is very
important now to understand Islam -——- one of the
world’s three major religions — when its follow-
ers seem “so ﬁerce and fearsome.”

While Sokolowski joked that he initially
wanted to reﬂect his involvement with the Warhol
by choosing something sordid, he said that he
changed his mind.

“The most important thing I thought I could

read from is a holy book,” he said. “What struck

‘me [about the Koran] was the poetic language of it

 but also how many ways we share [its ideas].”

The night’s second speaker, Kate Bradley, a
WYEP-FM radio DJ, had a more lighthearted rea-
son for her choice. She said she chose “How the
Camel Got His Hump” from Rudyard Kip1irrg’s
“Just So Stories” because she “wanted to choose
something fun and I-think it’s fun to say hump.”

Bradley said that the book was banned
because of, a different story that used “some
unfriendly language  and it wasfsupposed to be
a book for children.” '

Etta Cox, a local jazz vocalist, read ﬁve poems
from “My House,” by Nikki Giovanni, whom Cox
said is called the “Princess of Black Poetry.” The
book was also barmed for inappropriate language.

Cox, whose expressive reading prompted fre-
quent laughter from the audience, said she chose
the book because “I thought it was rather interest-
mg.”

Linda Dickerson, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
columnist, read from John Steinbeck’s “Of Mice
and Men.” She chose the book because she appre-
ciated Steinbeck’s description of “society’s sys-
tematic alienation of people who are in some way

Curtis came to the William Pitt Union

conductors attempted to regale the contes-
tants with tales of other college contestants,
including a University of Colorado student
who won a grand total of $86,000. __

“Oh, the money would be real good,”
Gorkin said “I always have bills I could

Gorkin was also intrigued by the lure of
the rich and famous. _

ties and everything,” said Gorkin, who

Curtis said she hoped an appearance on
television would be a springboard to fame.

“It’d be an excellent opportunity to get
into showbiz” Curtis said. “I’m really into
music and could get good exposure on tele-
vision.” , ‘ '

The roughest part of _the auditionscame
early as the 20.-plus applicants were subject-
ed to _a grueling 25—question true/false test.
Some questions, such as ‘The Stanley
Steamer was the ﬁrst steam powered loco-
motive,” were relatively easy. Others
proved less easy to master; _ ~

“Let’s just say I’m gladit was a 50-50
kind of test,” Curtis said. “They were such
random questions with weird stuﬁ”. If they
seemed totally oif the wall, I generally
agreed.” . . ‘

Curtis’s strategy was enough for her to
advance to the second half of the tryouts,
but Gorkin wasn’t so lucky.

“There ' were some tricky ones,” the
engineering physics major admitted, min-
utes before learning he hadn’t made the out

After the quiz period, the remaining 10
contestants were briefed on the} strategy of
playing Hollywood Squares. Since a con-
testant can give his or her opponent a square
if they answer a question wrong, a large part
of gaming strategy involves not only getting
one’s own questions right but also not help-
ing the opponent too much if you get a ques-
tion wrong. _

“The ﬁrst time it was explained to me,
I was totally blown away,” Lauri J anover,

the college search coordinator for
“Hollywood Squares,” said as she
explained the strategy.

‘ Another important strategy is knowing
which celebrities know what. “Whoopi’s
one of your safest bets,”‘Janover said. “She
usually gets about 80 percent correct. Some

Janover also served as the schizo-
phrenic nine-in-one celebrity during the
mock game show each prospective contes-
tant participated in. Two at a time, those

who had passed the quiz squared off against‘

one another in order to feel the rigors of an
actual show, where one hasto banter with
stars, strategize to make three x’s or o’s in a
row, and of course answer questions cor"-
rectly. The students also had todcmonstrate
positive energy and excitement A

“No one wants to see people on TV
who don’t look like they want to be there,”
J anover said.

Curtis enjoyed her moment in the spot— _

light.
“I loved being up there,” she said after
her four—question stint at the podium. “I
think being on TV would be even better.”

_ Curtis won’t know until November if

she is Goldberg’s newest chosen contestant.
The college-themed episodes of

“Hollywood Squares” will shoot over two

days at the end of January. '

“His decision to stay always came

As well as being an intellectual,
Posvar also crusaded for social equality.
He was determined to turn Pitt into an

For sale: integrity of academia  

“Welcome to Exxon University, for-
merly known as the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Does this sound preposterous to you?
It should. But it appears that universities are
the next institutions to sell naming rights.

Corporations are already buying nam-
ing rights to stadiums, the Smithsonian
Institution is selling sponsorships for its
galleries and a New York couple recently
tried to auction naming rights to their child.

Last Friday, California University of
Pennsylvania armounced that it would peti-
tion the state legislature to rename the
school Eberly University of Pennsylvania
after Robert Eberly, a natural gas mogul
whose family has donated vast sums to the
school.

Outgoing Gov. Tom Ridge has
endorsed the plan, and if passed, the name
change will take effect July 1, 2002.

The State System of Higher Education,
which ’ governs the state’s public colleges
and universities (Pitt, Penn State and
Temple are state-related), approves, and at
least one of its leaders said he wouldn’t
mind seeing other state schools follow
Califomia University’s lead.

At the time of the armouncement, there
was speculation — as yet unconﬁrmed —

that Eberly planned a $100 million dona- .

tion to the school.
While Eberly’s motives are doubtless
sincere, allowing someone to donate

‘soon.

enough money to have a school named for
him or her sets a dangerous precedent.

The renaming of California University
could set a trend whereby universities,
already strapped for cash (remember our
7.5 percent tuition increase this year),
would voluntarily rename themselves after
wealthy people or corporations that give
“donations.” _

Money already plays too large a role in
academia. Your family’s ﬁnancial status
determines where .you go to school.
Corporate and individual donors often have
a say in policies at universities, and spon-
sorships abound on campuses, Names
should not be the next aspect of academia
to fall to money.

While California University defends
its decision by saying the new name will
make it less of a regional school, it nonethe-
less is heading down a slippery slope.

Besides, aren’t there better ways to
improve your school? While the school has

been on the upswing the last several years, «

renaming it will not suddenly transform it.
Rather than legitimizing the institution,
naming the school for a wealthy donor
gives it an air of purchased gentility.
While ‘ California University of
Pennsylvania may not be the most fortu-
nate name, renaming the school after a
donor will do nothing to help it. Let’s hope
we don’t see Exxon University anytime

Feminism is about equality, not
burning bras and hating men

I recently overheard someone’ say
about her friend, “She comes off as some
sort of feminist or something.” She seemed
to think that it was totally inconceivable for
that category to still exist, or that if it did, no
woman would actually want to identify

But I identify myself as a feminist. And
I think it is important for our generation,
both men and women, to think about what
this label means. -

What do you think of when I say the
word “feminist?” I think for
most of our generation this
word evokes the image of a
horde of ‘angry man-hating
women burning their bras.

all, if my mother could earn more money
than several men in her office, how could I
say our society does not treat women equal-

I came to feminism for different and
personal reasons. I have seentoo many of

grade and everyone had to bring a book in
to school, my book was called “Girls Can
Do Anything!” So I grew up with the
assumption that being female could never

My mother’s accomplishments

seemed to prove this. She ﬁnished her mas- ‘

ter’s degree while raising two young chil-

small town so that she could have a better

enough to earn several promotions. She
was a great role model of a woman who is
successful professionally and also a good
mother.

me until recently to call myself a feminist.

I’m ~not your typical Southern
Belle. I don’t wear hoop skirts, I rarely
faint in public and I’ve never eaten
chitlins (for those of you who don’t
know, don’t ask). I don’t even have a

But there are still a few Southern
qualities firmly rooted in my personal-
ity. “Southern hospitality” is an exam-

Scarlett O’Hara wasn’t just sound-

ing sweet when she spoke about the

“kindness of strangers.” I was raised
thinking a Northern introduction con-
sists of an exchange of names and, if
you’re feeling generous, a firm stiff
handshake. It’s businesslike, proper
and completely inhospitable.

Mercy me —— in Dixieland this
would never do.

Southern folks expect to strike up
a conversation with the people that
they meet. Introduced as a little lass to
adults at my parents’ work, I was
expected to strike up a charming con-
versation. I think the art of chitchat

covered that the city has its share of
pleasant diversions — more than
enough to make up for the lack of rope
swings and barbeques. And I’m meet-
‘mg plenty of awesome people with
whom to enjoy the splendors.

Since my first night here people
have seemed to go out of their way to
make me feel welcome. My room-
mates are as nice as could be, and I
find that I have a lot in common with
my Yankee counterparts. New friends
have welcomed me into their apart-

Pittsburgh has three!

if we demand that she be beautiful and
thin as well as competent, are we really
treating her equally?

You can teach young girls that they
can become anything they want, just as
my mother taught me. But as long
Britney Spears is celebrated as the epito-
me of female beauty, this message will
be continually undermined.

Look at the women we make into
celebrities: Destiny’s Child, Jennifer
Lopez, Julia Roberts. All of them teach
us that it does not matter how intelligent
or hard—working a womanis, the thing
that ultimately makes her valuable is the
size of her waist, breasts or butt.

This is not to say that my argument
is restricted to eating disorders or other
areas of physical appearance. Rather, I
think that these issues are a subtle but
powerful indication of the ways in which

V our society is still fundamentally unequal

' and hostile to women. It pointed out to

me that the work of the ﬁrst and even
second generation of feminism is not
done.

Feminism is an important concept
for me because the work of feminist
writers has helped me to examine these
issues. And the feminism I believe in is
about freedom and choices.

It means a woman has the choice to
become the executive of a Fortune 500
company or to stay at home and take
care of her children.’ It means the choice
to get married young or not at all. And it
means being able to make the choice to
love and Value yourself, even if you are

If the loss to South Florida two weeks

it was also a setback for the Miami

The Panthers tried six times in the
school’s history to beat a No. 1-ranked team,
and failed to win each time. The last No. ,1
opponent Pitt faced was Penn State in 1997
and the Panthers lost 34-17.

The last time the Panthers defeated a top

New HR King? Will Mets take the division?-

No one asked for my opinion, but:

Warren Morris should be the
Pirates’ second baseman when spring
training starts next year

J ack Wilson and Abraham Nunez can
share time at shortstop, and Morris can
contribute much more offensively and is
good with his glove.

While Wilson and Nunez are great
defensively, neither is consistent enough
to be in the lineup every day. Two seasons
ago, Morris was among the top second
base players in the National League and
despite a disappointing 2000 season,
there is no reason to believe he couldn’t
perform at that level again. ,_

The only.other option for the Pirates
would be to give Pat Meares one more try
at second. But Meares will probably
never be the player he was before he
injured his hand. Making him the perma-
nent second baseman would be a step in

‘the season and will be placed

the wrong direction.

need is Carl Everett

A Lecture & ~ Learning
Series on Journalism

Tired of just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance
to make news.

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do
journalism. Come learn about how it’s done, and then consider
actually making history by doing it for the University’s only

independent daily newspaper.

Applications will be available at each talk in case you like
what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just
stop by, learn a little, and talk with the people who already
edit and write the newspaper.
