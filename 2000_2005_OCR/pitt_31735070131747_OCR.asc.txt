VoLtiME XCVIII, NUMBER -64

Crafts, polka,
kolbasi come  
to Pitt festival

MIKE MASLANIK
Staff Writer

Hundreds of people, most decked out
in colorful traditional Slovak garb, packed ‘
the  of Leaming Commons Room
Sunday." They feasted on stuffed cabbage,
enjoyed singers and dancers, and cel
all things Slovak.

People from all over the Pittsburgh
area, which has a Slovak population higher
than that of most cities, came to enjoy the
13th annual Slovak Heritage Festival. A

joint effort by Pitt’s Slovak Studies Program -

and the Pitt Slovak Club, the festival is an
expression of Pitt’s unique relationship with
Slovakia. "

‘There isn’t any other place in the
country where you can study ﬂre Slovak
language,” said Christine Metil, administra-
tor of Pitt’s Slovak department and director
of the festival.

' Pitt established the Slavic language
program in 1985, when the First Catholic’
Slovak Union, along with four other Slovak
fratemals, donated $500,000 to the
University to sponsor an endowment for the
program. Since then, the Slavic language
department has held the festival every year, .
in order to give back to Pittsburgh’s Slavi
community. - . . . 1

Among the tables selling decorative
Hungarian eggs and Slovak-made vases
and bowls, John Antonich of the
Slovakaires hawked a collection of polka
Christmas tunes.

‘‘We’ve been on all the TV stations that
play polka music,” he said, “and we’ve
recorded 10 albums.”

The producer, director, and singer in
the 10-piece, McKees Rocks-based polka
outﬁt proudly displayed his group’s two
most recent Christmas compact discs, one
dedicated to midnight mass and the other to
the Latin mass.

SALEM, ‘Mass. — Stands selling Salem

1 memorabilia, novelty items, costume acces-

sories and light-up toys and trinkets ﬁlled
every street. Local shops opened their door
and welcomed in the many tourists.

‘ Sight—seeing tours of the witch dim-
geon, villages, the original mansion, the jails
and the museums are offered daily from
April until November with the Haunted
Happenings feature around Halloween.

Thousands of people each year ﬂockto
Salem, Mass., to watch local townspeople
re-create the many historical urban legends
that exist within Salem’s city  This
Halloween did not prove to be an exception.

‘This timeoftheyearisgneat.As soon
as oneHalloween season ends, we begin
planning for the ne ” said Janet Middleton,
a lifelong resident of Salem.

N A spooky surprise seemed to wait at

- every turn — some part of the tourist atmos-

phere, others planted by someone just want-
ing to get a good scare out of someone.
Either way, there was noescaping the goose

Ghostly . moans wafted through the
crowds of people coming to check out ﬂue
legends of the town. Some dressed as witch-

- es, devils and angels, while others donned‘

costumes to resemble popular horror ﬁlm

A characters. Other people wore no costume at

all and just checked out the sights.
' Salem was more than the site of the

infamous witch trials of the 17th century.

According to some locals and tourists,
ghosts wander the area on a daily basis

because of the bad omens that trouble the

area.

Slovak Festival, which was held in the Cathedral of Learning last Sunday.

Dancers follow families’ steps

Slovak, page 1

“One time, a Pittsburgh priest heard our
tape,” Antonich recalled, “and he liked it so
much ﬂrat he took it to Rome and had it
played on Vatican radio for,the Pope.”

To pay for the festival, the Slovak
department sold raﬂle tickets for a _“basket
of Slovakia,” ﬁlled with Slovak beer, candy
and pins, along with Slovak food like halus-
ki, or cabbage and noodles, and kolbasi. The
Pitt Slovak Club contribmed by sponsoring
a pastry donation table, where patrons could
either drop olf a baked good or buy some-
thing someone donated. ’ _

“We’ll take any kind of pastry; it does-
n’t have to be sweet,” said Slovak Club
President Diana Pinchevsky,_ referring to a
plate of sauerkraut bread.

ThiswasthethirdtimeMaryCrilley
and Jermy Edwards attended the Slovak
Heritage Fest. Both have Slovak blood rim-

. ning through their veins, and Crilley is'tak-

ing Slovak language classes at Pitt.
“I ‘enjoy the dancers the most,”
Edwardssaid, “and the shopping is good,

Speaking of dancers, festival-goers
were entertained by the Pittsburgh Area
Slovak Ensemble cavorting near the rear of
the commons room. The girls Wore white
dresses and bonnets trimmed with multicol-
ored stitching, and the guys sported large,
_midriﬂ°-baring shirts and swung wooden
axes.
The 12-member dance troupe has per-
formed traditional Slovak dances in
Chicago, New York City, and Washington,
D.C., among other places, according to
Matt Pacacha, a’ Duquesne student and
ensemble dancer.

“Our grandparents started the group 30
or 31 years ago,” fellow dancer ’ Joe
Lipchick said. “It’s a family thing — I grew
up with it.”

It is important for Pitt  continue to »_
recognize" Slovak studies, Christine Metil

said, because the Pittsburgh area has the
nation’s largest concentration of Slovak-
 The festival brings peo-
ple together to share in the fellowship and
pride of others with Slovak heritage.

“I believe it is a very positive thing, that

way,” Metil said. - '

Ghosts rumored

Salem is best known, however, for the
witch trials that took place there in 1692.

Many women were accused of practic-

to   inhabit S alem
ing witchcraft and working at the Devil.

According to the account of the trials,

19 were hanged, and one old man was

according to the transcripts. - '

The type of cell each person got was
based on the amount of money the person
had. No money meant a tiny cell, and some
were so cramped that the prisoners could not
even sit down, let alone lie down.

In the Vlfitch Dungeon Museum,
tourists got to see a recreation of what these
dungeons looked like. These stories, along
with many others, shine some light into the
haunted past of Salem.

On each of the tours offered to Salem
visitors, all the participants were asked to
take pictures. 1 A '

Many of the creepy pictures that the
town has on record in Salem were sent in by

~ tourists, who were taking pictures in the
town and discovered when they got the pic-
tures developed that ghosts, fuzzy images of
distant people, smoke or ghostly ﬁgments
could be seen, _
_ , Whether or not ghosts exist, Salem has
built its reputation on ghouls and tales of
witchcraft.

Don’t miss a chance to get rowdy onTV‘

Pitt students have a reason to haul
themselves out of bed and start party-
ing a few hours early Saturday — as if
anyone ever needed a reason for that.

ESPN ’s College GameDay will be
broadcasting from Heinz Field from
10:30 a.m. until noon, before the
Panthers take on Virginia Tech at 7:45
p.m.

Finally, Pitt fans have a chance to
show the world what crazy, enthusias-
tic fans they are. This is a showcase for
gusto.

Tailgaters should think of this as
an audition. If they do well, Pitt will
look more attractive to numerous
publics. For instance, high school stu-
dents considering .Pitt may see the
show" and realize what a good time
Panther fans have before games.
Students at other colleges could see
how tremendous a Pitt pre-game
bonanza is, and be in awe -— as well
they should be. High school recruits
could see what passionate fans there
are in Pittsburgh, and that could sway
their school decisions — which leads
to better athletes, a better program, and
more money. And who can say no to
that? If the fans really wow the show,
Pitt will be remembered as a school
that knows how to put on a spectacle.
Maybe it would even lead to greater
coverage. —

ESPN’s choice is huge for Pitt. So
Pitt needs to make every effort it can to

get students crazy and riled up. With
all the resources the University has at
hand, there is no plausible reason for
the parking lot at Heinz Field not to be
packed. . ,

First, facilitate. Parking lots typi-
callyopen four hours before an event.
In this case, that would miss the show
completely, leaving ESPN with some
pretty boring footage. Get the lots
open by 10 a.m. at the latest, so stu-
dents can get a decent spot and begin
getting excited. ,

Then,-~ publicize. Get Mr. Audix to
leave a voice mail on every campus

phone informing students of their

chance at fame. Heck, get Audix to’
offer a wake-up call to all the on—carn-
pus students, too. Even better — get
the marching band. to blast in the
Ashtray. Post some ﬂiers. Rally stu-
dent groups. Transportation is always
an issue — get the shuttles up and run-
ning early. —
‘And if "all else fails, use bribery.
‘Students are suckers for free stuff.
Hand out T—shirts, ice cream, towels or
whatever else is lying around.

This is a huge opportunity for the
University to build prestige and excite-
ment. This game features two "of the
five front-runners for the Heisman
Trophy, and the ramiﬁcations for the
Big East -are huge. It’s an important
rnatchup and an important chance for
Pitt to shine. '

A realisrtic, firfiand look at the homeless

Until a few months ago, Charles
Chapman and I weren’t acquainted. I heard
about him when I mysteriously ended up on

spondence, I learned a good ‘

unusual — than a college sophomore who
spends the bulk of his free time playing cards
with drifters and addicts? 

On that Saturday evening, we met up at
the Quad and set out. We were picked upby
one of the two Mikes who also frequent the
shelters, and the four of us — Charles, Mike,
Mike and myself — spent the trip talking
about anything and everything except the
homeless, ranging from sports to relation-
ships to Madonna’s and Britney’s now-infa-

could repeat it with vigor — covetousness,

Charles and the Mikes were quick to point
out, talk and action are always two very sep-
arate concepts. ‘ ,

beenthere before and will be ﬂiere again.
Because no matter how well they may
understand the necessary steps to move on
up, many also understand that it’s easier to

their allotted time is up at one place, they
move to another, and so on. In most cases,

There simply isn’t enough kissing going on around here

Some of the best advice ever offered can be found on the
little candy message hearts that show up in the millions
around Valentine’s Day. The words of wisdom are a
short but powerful imperative statement: “Kiss Me.”

Not nearly enough kissing goes on in America, and
the kissing that does rarely receives enough praise.
When Europeans greet each other, at least one kiss on
the cheek is involved, usually more. Even if you’re
meeting for the first time, you can be sure lips will be
grazing your cheeks. Having experienced this in
Germany and Italy, my roommate and I often reﬂect on
the fact that the doub1e—cheek kiss evokes feelings of
welcome and warmth that an American handshake and
4-feet—between-us distance simply can’t

As for the kissing that does occur, it hardly receives
enough credit. Friends don’t want to hear about kissing;
only when things go beyond ﬁrst base are the stories consid-
ered interesting. While sex is an unparalleled act of love and
pleasure, that doesn’t mean kissing should be ignored or
underrated. However, there seems tobe such an emphasis on
everything after kissing that kissing itself doesn’t get the

recognition it deserves. Aside from the pleasure principle,

that inelfable kiss has plenty of other beneﬁts as well.
Kissing is good for your health. Once you’re kissing
someone regularly, attention to dental hygiene skyrockets.
You’re brushing every half—hour and you ﬁnally begin ﬂoss-
ing. Kissing increases saliva production, which helps prevent

tooth decay. Also, bad health habits don’t stand a chance
against a good make—out session. You can’t smoke cigarettes,
do drugs, drink alcohol, or eat
unhealthily while engaging in lip con-
nections. Furthermore, kissing can
burn around 100 calories an hour. Bye-
bye, treadmill; hello, tonsil hockey. .
Convenience is another one of
kissing’s great qualities. Vlﬁth cell
. phones, Palm Pilots and wirelessness
, everywhere, a portable mode of affec-
tion ﬁts perfectly into anyone’s on-the-
go schedule. You can usually kiss any-
. where without offending anyone and
still express your care for another per-
son. But _to avoid giving public kissing

‘a bad  keep it to quick, clean pecks. At the Pitt vs.

Syracuse football game, I witnessed a bizarre peck/tongue
combination that almost made me lose my just—eaten $3 bag
of Heinz Field peanuts. '

And who isn’t busy these days? With homework, class-
es, jobs and partying, ﬁnding time to be affectionate can be
stressful. Kissing is quick If you do it right, you can create
an incredible kiss in seconds, plus you won’t have to bother
showering or cuddling afterward.

T Additionally, relationships indisputably beneﬁt from a
strong emphasis on kissing. Let’s face it. One day you’re

going to be old and decrepit Kissing may be the-only act
you’re physically capable of performing with your equally
feeble partner. If you’ve spent your whole life perfecting and
enjoying kissing, having this as your only form of sensual

contact will be nothing to complain about ’

And unless you’re a really great ventriloquist, you can’t
argue when you’re kissing._Nothing seems to quiet even the

most riled-up person like a great kiss. The intimacy of kiss- -

ing exceeds any other ‘act. According to the Guide to Getting
It On, troubled couples stop kissing on the lips long before
they stop having intercourse. A friend of mine had mononu-
cleosis last year, a contagious disease that prevented her from
kissing her boyfriend for months. While she was able to do
“other stulf,” she told me she would have gladly given all
that up to be able to kissagain.

If you think kissing eventually gets boring, you might be

with the wrong person or lack creativity. One of the greatest ,

aspects of kissing is its vast range. There’s the quick greeting
peck And then there’s the mind-blowing, your-whole-bod -
feels-it, so—ﬂ1is-is-what-heaven-feels-like kiss. Not to men-
tion everything in between. Not that you ever needed an

excuse, but now that you know the endless beneﬁts of

smooching, make like a Hershey’s chocolate and kiss.

Maria wants her parents and brother, loyal readers of her

column, to know that she. has never kissed anyone. She. can

Taking a fair and balanced look at FOX News

Each day, millions of viewers tune in
for their daily dose of FOX News. Thank
the gods that such a huge number of
Americans are receiving as “fair and bal-
anced” information as possible. What
would we do as a nation if ’
we were deprived of the
paragon of objectivity that is
FOX News? Well, maybe
we’d actually know the truth

I At the beginning of
October, after a ﬁve-month

That is, until veteran newsman Chris
Wallace decided to leave ABC for FOX.
When asked if he had any concerns over
the purported biases of FOX News,
Wallace replied that FOX News had got-

ten an “unfair rap,” and that

they were really “serious,

thoughtful and even—hand-

ed.” This was too much for
Reina to bear. ‘

In an interview with

' Salon, ‘Reina describes the

FOX newsroom as a place

where the politics of the

' bosses are felt on a daily

Network, published the Columnist note listing which correspon-
results of poll that gave sub- “ . dents are stationed where

stantial evidence that FOX

News perpetuated misconceptions about
the war in Iraq. This does quantify pretty
clearly the sort of conservative bias FOX
News is accused of having. Since, with
good reason, nobody ever trusts statistics,
many still reject such arguments. Fine.

To this ever-growing heap of damn-
ing evidence, we can add yet another
smoking gun: the account of former FOX
News producer Charlie Reina.

Reina, who spent six years at FOX
News — in a variety of positions, from
copy editor and writer to producer, on
both hard news and feature -news pro-
grams — ﬁnally quit in April over long-
standing frustrations concerning salary
and respect. And, while the “fair and bal-
anced” debate over FOX’s objectivity
has been raging around him, he has kept
his mouth shut. 7

and what stories will be cov-

ered that day is distributed throughout the
newsroom. A

This is probably a completely normal

thing in any network television news-

room, except, according‘to Reina, any.

time a more controversial issue was
included in the editorial note, it was often
prefaced with what he describes as subtle
admonitions. ‘

' He cites the following editorial note: ‘

‘There is something utterly. incompre-
hensible about Koﬁ Annan’s remarks in
which he allows that his thoughts are
‘with the Iraqi people.’ One could‘ ask
where those thoughts were during the 23
years Saddam. Hussein was brutalizing
those same Iraqis. Food for thought.”
Later on in the interview, he recalls a
far less subtle statement of editorial ide-
ology. At one point, Reina was assigned

to do an environmental special. While
meeting with his boss to discuss what
sort of piece was expected, his boss said,

"‘You understand, you know, it’s not

going to come out the pro-environmental
side.” ’ '

When Reina balked, his boss said, I

“You can obviously give both sides, but
just make sure that the pro-environmen-
talists don’t get the last word.” Reina
would eventually refuse to do the project.

’ FOX, of _course, has responded by

"denouncing Reina as a disgruntled ex-

employee. However, they’ve kept suspi-
ciously mum about their editorial notes.
It’s questionable that Reina, who’s cur-
rently running all woodworking business
in New York, wouldembark on a base-
less smear campaign against FOX News,
given that it clearly jeopardizes ‘any
future news career prospects for him.

It’s OK for FOX to have a conserva-
tive editorial policy. That’s the beauty of

the First Amendment. But to proclaim.

itself as the quintessence of objectivity

sive '

of conservatives looking to have your
opinions validated by a partisan news
source, then, by all means, -watch FOX

A thankless urge
to share with those

less fortunate

Miller, page 

But you won’t ﬁnd that attitude among
the shelter staff, including the churches who

supply them with food, and guys like

Charles and the Mikes who donate their
time. They have no misconceptions about
those they work with, no romanticized
vision of helping the less fortunate. They

simply give their time and energy to a group '

of people who often don’t appreciate it, and
that can be thankless work. But then again,
this is not a project for praise 
OnNov. 15, Charles and theMikes will
host a clothing drive on the North Side to
beneﬁt Pittsburgh’s homeless. It will be an
exercise in community; ‘a reminder that,
even in the individualist empire, no man is

. an island. If you are willing and able, I’m

sure they will appreciate all the clothing
donations they can get. Involvement in
activities like this onewillplace youinvery

break the party-and-pleasure mold to ﬁnd
something more valuable; people who

understand the difference between talk and V

action. If you’re not careful, you may even
ﬁnd some of your convictions rocked, par-

ticularly the one that assures you an individ- ‘

3 While Fred Durst might hope that the
title Results May Vary connotes the inner
struggles of not being able to please
everyone, in turn hoping to milk whatev-
er empathy Limp Bizkit fans have left. for
the whining “M.C.,” it’s clear that the title
also functions as a disclaimer: Ifyou don’t
dig this album, then it’s just not for you.

In Limp Bizkit’s tenure as nu‘-metal
royalty, Durst and company have graced

stadium stages with their angst-ridden I
squirming and pyrotechnic gimmickry.

and offered up MTV-friendly radio farts
for an increasingly pigeonholed audience
of hormonal kids.

On Results May Vary, we ﬁnd a 31-

year-old Durst falling back on the same‘

profane proclamations, tired catch phrases
and laughable (arrogance that have sold
Limp Bizkit records for the past half-

i decade.

The album’s ﬁrst single, “Eat You
Alive,” starts out the belch-fest by ogling
uninterested women, as Durst chants,
“Damn/You’re so hot” and admits, “I’d
love to sniff on them panties,” while oscil-
lating guitars and corny drum thumps

‘slips into an improper ambience, with

uncomfortably sustained guitar chords
giving way to Durst’s sorry self-pity.
Tracks like “Down Another Day” and
“Build a Bridge” follow suit with lyrics
like, “Change is melting everything,” and
“It’s gonna fall apart/Break my heart.”

Elsewhere, Durst cries himself to
sleep, laments over a “lonely wprld,” and
thoroughly butchers The Who’s “Behind
Blue Eyes,” leaving the listener drenched
in a pool of his lyrical drool and tear
drops. V '

Results fails even to provide the
memorable, if classless, hooks and chorus
lines of a past Bizkit material. Instead, we
hear the rnish-mashing ofoverproduced
instruments and a surplus of shrug—off—
able convictions.

I suppose, then, that this album just

isn’t for me. It’s true that some people
might connect with its crotch-grabbing
machismo and aimless emotional slobber-
ing, but the fact remains that Results May
Vary is painfully fantastic example of why
Durst should grow up, get over the emo-
tional turmoil of his youth and stick it up
his — whoa.

Almost every track on this disc has one
interesting sample e be it of bagpipes, a
nice guitar ritf, or a big-band trumpet ﬂare
— but feels compelled to hide this tolerable

sound beneath layers upon layers of the most
hideous noise you could imagine. Wah bass,
‘80s hair metal, nails dragging across a

Quite honestly, I haven’t been able to
ﬁnd any consistency to this album. The song
“God Never Knows” manages to ﬂail
between soft chanting over techno, dark rock
music and bagpipe melodies straight from
the Scottish Highlands. No one knows why.
“Fragmentation,” which seems like it very
well should be some manner of rock piece,
sounds more like a cat chasing a laser point-

“Heat Guy J,” if I’m not mistaken, is a
show about an android detective in an almost
ﬁlm noir-esque setting, but what this random

such a premise is completely beyond me.
This album was so bad that I now have sec-

Reflections on the advice given to the Class of 1997

A friend of mine regularly reads my
writing, and he has commented a few
times that I can’t seem to write without
mentioning Kurt Cobain. After a
week in a drunken haze that began
with margaritas, I don’t have a single
idea for a column. Of course, the
obvious cop-out would be something
Kurt/Nirvana/Courtney—related. But I’m
not going to do it. ' '

Instead, I’m going to reﬂect on the
wonderful advice in ~Baz Luhrrnann’s
“Everybody’s Free to Wear. Sunscreen”
song, originally a column written by Mary .
Schmich — youcan thank my friend for
saving you from my ‘90s nostalgia.

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. 0h,
never mind. You will not understand the power
and beauty of your youth until they ’ve faded. But
trust me, in 20 years, you’ll look back at photos
of yourself and recall, in a way you can ’t grasp
now, how much possibility lay before you and
how fabulous you really looked. I do it already.
Every now and then, I flip through high school
photos and miss being so tiny. Sure, I’m still tiny,
but now I have hips, and I’m not as toned as I was.
I’m digging the bigger boobs I now have, though.
I can only imagine what I’m going to feel like
when I look at my college photos when I’m in my
40s.

Don’t worry about the future. 0r worry, but know -

    
  

Mvticll
A & El Editor

that worrying is as effective as
trying to solve an algebra equa-
tion by chewing bubble gum.
I’m still trying to take this one to
_ heart. I freaked out before moving
into my. first apartment because
IKEA didn’t have the -bed I want-.
ed, and I practically give myself
ulcers worrying about trivial
things like $15 parking tickets
and five-point quizzes.

Don ’t be reckless with other peo-
ple’s hearts. Don ’t put up with peo-
ple who are reckless with yours. A
stupid boy once hurt me-more than I
had ever been hurt in my entire life.
It was like he ripped my heart’ out of my chest and
stomped on it before putting it into a blender, then
cooking it. It was the latter part of that bit" of
advice that got me through it. Why on earth would
I mourn over someone who could be such an
insensitive jerk? ‘ -

Don ’t feel guilty if you don ’t know what you want‘

to do with your life. I began college an aspiring

lawyer. Then I was a writer. And then an infonna- ‘

tion scientist. We’re back to writing, and‘ who
knows, maybe after I move into the cubicle next to
David Fricke at Rolling Stone, I’ll get bored with
what I’m doing. Regardless, I’ll know it’s OK.

Enjoy your body. ‘Use it every way you can. Don’t

be afraid of it or of what other people think of it.
'It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own. This
is why so many of you have seen Laverne &
Shirley. They’re only breasts. I’ve used them‘ to
my advantage before, and I won’t care about doing
it again. Last weekend, I used themsabotage my
opponent’s shot in pool.

. Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your

living room. It has to be one of the best stress-
relievers ever. And if you can’t get down naked in
your living room, where can you get down?

Understand that friends come and go, but with a
precious few, you should hold on. You won’t have
to work hard to figure out who those precious few
are. They are the ones who you drink beer with at
3. pm. in a basement apartment while wearing
bathing suits for no reason. They are the ones you

’ run through the streets of South Oakland with,

holding hands and screaming the, lyrics to Andrew
W.K.’s “I Love New York City.” They are the ones
whose fights you break up, only to suffer a bruised
chest, messed—up arm and ripped stockings fro
tackling them in the street at 4 a.m. ‘ ‘

Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient,

with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nos-
talgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past
from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the
ugly parts and recycling_it for more than it’s_
worth. I’m not going to cheapen this with an
explanation. You get it.

Eels’ Everett talks

Last Tuesday, The Eels paid a visit to Pittsburgh.
Before arriving, the band’s front man and creator,
Mark Everett —— known to his legions of fans simply
as “E” — found the time to discuss depression and the
state of affairs in these rock—hard times.

A lot of your music is considered to be. pretty
depressing. Are you as depressed as you seem to be?

I think you have to pay closer attention to the '
music. It’s really not that depressing. I mean, there are
occasional songs that could be thought of that way, but
more often than not, there’s something going on in the
music, in particular, that’s looking for the light at the
end of the tunnel.

Do you have a favorite song that you’ve Written?

I’ve got a few favorites. We played this song,
“Climbing to the Moon,” from Electra-Shock Blues
yesterday for the first time in a few years, and I real-
ized that’s one of my favorites. I like a song called
“F—er” and “It’s a Motherf——er.” I like all those
songs with “f——” in the title. And “Daisies of the
Galaxy,” that’s another one of my favorites.

How did you get involved in music?

Well, by the time I was 20, everybody was going

off to college and I didn’t know what to do with my
life. I wasn’t interested in anything that everyone else
was interested in, it seemed. And the only thing it
seemed I really had a passion for was writing songs,
which I was doing all the time. I was really just con-
sumed by it, and I didn’t know where I was heading
with it, so it was really a scary and weird lost feeling.
But I just kept doing it and kept doing it, and didn’t do
anything else. I barely socialized or anything. All I
ever did was write songs and work jobs that I hated,
then go back and write more songs. \
I wanted to ask you What inspired you to Write
some of the songs on Shootenanny.’ The one that I
was really interested in was the song “Agony.” It’s
a pretty downer song.

Well, the reason why it’s not a downer song to me
is because I was not in a great frame of mind when I
sat down to write it, but a few minutes later, I had writ-
ten a song, and I felt much better.

How about “Love of the Loveless?”

“Love of the Loveless” isone of my favorites of
all—time, actually. Add that to my all—time favorite list.
I think it’s saying something I haven’t heard said in a
song before. I was just thinking about how some peo-
ple aren’t given the kind of love — or whatever they
need when they’re young — that will nourish them
into adulthood so they can survive and thrive in the
world. Those people have to find it for themselves,
somehow, and that’s no easy thing. But it’s a beautiful
thing.

What about “Restraining Order Blues?”
That is a character study. I’m happy to say it’s not
autobiographical. I get a lot of people who are really

COURTESY DREAMWORKS RECORDS ‘'

scared of me now, more so than usual, becauseof that
song. But it’s not based on any real situation. I just
wanted to write a song about someone in that situation.
You’ve got to find the humanity, even in your villains,
and it’s a more interesting way to find humanity, I
think, to write about someone like that, rather than
some more obvious situation.

Do you have any advice for aspiring musicians?
Stick to your guns. I don’t know; that’s such a

cliche. I think it’s harder now more than ever to make A

something happen in the music business, and it’s a mir-
acle that guys like me have gotten this far. I think it’s
really important to really try not to lose your last shred
of dignity in these rock-hard times. You’ve got to be
prepared to not be everybody at the record company’s
best friend and to be thought of as a difﬁcult artist and
that kind of thing because, really, that’s all a good thing
and a compliment in the end. . '

Industrial music from past decades compares to Nine Inch Nails

Mﬂecked

Pig "

WaxTrax!/T VT Records, 1997
Recommended if you like:
Ministry, Nine Inch Nails,_
Mudvayne, Static-X

Imagine for a moment that Trent
Reznor and Richard Wagner. had an
illegitimate. mutant child and raised
him in London on nothing but tequila
and peyote with plenty of "power tools
and knives to play with. Next, imagine
that they unleashed him on the unsus-
pecting world of underground "industri-
al music in 1988.

Raymond Watts, otherwise known
as Pig, is a veteran of the now effec-
tively defunct industrial music scene
that thrived during the heyday of
WaxTrax! Records in Chicago through-
out the ‘80s and ‘90s. Most of the par-
ties involved are either ‘officially bro-
ken up, past their prime or simply per-
sonae non grata these days.

For the uninitiated, _industri_al
music can be many things, but it is
most simply ‘characterized by the
fusion of electronic elements with
metal and heavy percussion. From that
point, there exists a great deal of possi-
ble deviance, of course — the premier
artists on the industrial scene included
a very wide variety ‘of sounds: the
power metal duo Ministry, the distinct-
ly Euro, beat-heavy KMFDM, the wild,
synthetic, gothic Skinny Puppy and the
sheet-metal banging Germans "known
as Einstuerzende Neubauten.

 Despite the decline of the Chicago I

Trax scene, industrial music today is
undergoing something‘ of a' renaissance
—— many of the bands are reuniting and

' generating new material, and the blend-

ing of metal and electronica has matric-

wulated into mainstream rock.. No,

Linkin Park didn’t invent that.
‘ Pig was a regular fixture of the
industrial genre throughout almost the

entirety of its existence. Emerging in .

1980 as a - member of KMFDM,
arguably the cornerstone of the scene,
Watts left the group and went solo with
A Poke inthe Eye  With a Sharp Stick
in 1988 and remains active to, this day
—— his most recent release being
Genuine American Monster in 2002.
For ' your post-Halloween con-
sumption,’ I give , you Wrecked, his

fourth major album; a freight train hor- .

ror show careening at a thousandmiles
per hour. Representative of the point in
Watts’ career at which his grandiose,

‘theatrical, industrial-goth—rock sound

reached critical mass, ‘Wrecked, is a
beautifully and relentlessly’-Vviolent,

messy, sordid album. It throws every-’

thing at the listener but still manages
not to be overbearing.
The album’s sound is truly. unlike

anything you’re likely to have ever‘

heard. The. knee—jerk reaction is to
compare Pig to Nine Inch Nails and,
indeed, similarities exist ——- grinding
guitar riffs, brooding lyrics, haunting
synthetic sounds and the destroy-
everything-in-your—path attitude are all
there. But the differences are rather
profound. While Reznor’s music is
introverted, personal and ultimately
thematically meek by its nature, Watts’
is ballsy, dramatic and tonally potent

I and evocative, while beingydevoid of

any coherent meaning. A
Pig’s sound is also just about ten
times‘ larger and more expansive than
any of his contemporaries. While the
staple guttural growling of Watts’ voice

and wild metal guitars often take the
forefront, equally prominent are blar-
ing homs,_ strings and other heavy,
symphonic explosions. Particularly
epic are “No One Gets out of Her
Alive” and “Save Me,” which feature,

over their dark’ choruses, thundering

horns and wispy strings, respectively.
Other tracks, such as “Silt” and
“Sanctuary” are equally tremendous,
but are a breed of more traditional,
synth-driven, ethereal goth.

It’s a shame that the same media
that pats Reznor on the back every time
hesneezes has overlooked Pig. But,
because Pig isn’t particularly label-
friendly in comportment or style, it’s

easy to understand how this fate could
befall such a truly original artist.

With a little bit of digging, Pig
albums can be found at local used CD
stores, as well as from online retailers.
Fans of aggressive, intense music,
regardless "of genre, owe it to them-
selves to check Wrecked out, as well as
Sinsation, the slightly, less refined
album that preceded this one. '

If you can be open—minded about
genre-shattering music, you’ll find
that, in terms of badass-ness, Pig can
rip the heads off of today’s most badass
bands. And that level of intensity war-
rants investigation, if nothing else.

Panther at Alumni Stadium, something

Adjustments helped in over

Staff Writer

If there was a key to the Pitt football team’s
24-13 victory against‘ Boston College last
Saturday, it was the adjustments they made.

Quarterback Rod Rutherford adjusted and
took what the Eagles’ defense would give him,
throwing for 156 yards to his running backs

alone.

The Panthers adjusted their offensive game
plan by running more sweeps to the outside
which not only softened up the middle of the‘
field for running back Tim Murphy, but also set
 up one of the game’s biggest plays — a 35-yard
halfback option pass from running back Jawan
Walker to wide_ receiver Larry Fitzgerald for the

game’s final touchdown.

Defensively, Pitt overcame a shaky first drive
to hold Boston College to just one touchdown

and 186 yards passing.

which hasn’t been said in awhile.

“It was Very exciting for our football
team to be back on that campus, on that
field, with a different result,’_’ head
coach Walt Harris said.

Perhaps the most encouraging thing
to be taken away from’ the game was the
running game, which continues to try to
produce yardage without starting run-
ning back Brandon Miree.

L “The toss-sweeps spread everything —
out more,” guard Dan LaCarte said.
“[Those plays] set up the big play to

Larry.”

All in all, it was a pretty good day to be a Pitt

Harris praised the work of his offen-
sive line. He also pointed out that his
receivers made several key blocks
downfield, most notably on Walker’s
47-yard touchdown catch. .

_ The Oakland Zoo is back, and this
year, it looks a little different.

The student group, created by Matt

has a new logo and plans to hand out
free T-shirts to any student season-tick-

this week. - ' P A

“We want to have them all ready
for Nov. 22 [the day of the 0

said; “We want them - to
bring their ticket or some-
thing that shows us they
have season tickets. We’re
not giving them away to
people that aren’t going to
wear them to the games.” .

The first tailgate will
take place from 3 p.m. until
7 p.m. in the upstairs of-Joe
Mama’s, before
Wednesday’s exhibition

' game against the 320 All-

will also be able to pick—up a shirt at
Qdoba between noon and game time on

bition game against the EA Sports All-

Panthers end their season with win over Orangemen

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Billy Brush recorded a hat trick to push the
Panthers past the Orangemen 3-2 on Sunday at
Founders Field.

The forward’s first of three goals came at 43:03
when he took the pass from midfielder Jeffrey Tidd
and blew the shot by Syracuse goalkeeper Alim
Karim. The shot, from 25 yards out, curved its way
inside the far post and tied the game at one before the
half ended.

Brush’s second goal came less than a minute
after Syracuse took a 2-1 lead.

. Brush worked himself away from the Syracuse
defense and shot the ball to the top corner of the net.
The unassisted goal came at 52:37.

Pitt (6-11-l overall, 3-6-1 Big East) forward
Keeyan Young recorded an assist on Brush’s third
goal. Young passed the ball over to Brush, who shot
it into an open net, as Karim was out of position.
With that assist, Young finished the year as the

. Panthers’ leading scorer, with six goals and three

assists.
With that goal, Brush became the 11th Pitt
Panther to record a hat trick.

The goal came at 59:29 and put the Panthers up
3-2. It was Brush’s fifth goal on the season and made
him the second—leading scorer on the team. Joe
Luxbacher, who just completed his 20th year as the
Panther’s head coach, explained how it was confi-
dence that helped Brush score three goals. He said
that, once he scored the first goal, the rest just fell
into place.

“Confidence is a big thing,” Luxbacher said.

Syracuse (4-8-5, 1-5-4) scored its first goal when
forward Jeff Evans took a pass from forward Kirk

Johnson and sent a shot past goalkeeper Justin

Lowery. The goal came at 24:57 and gave the
Orangemen the early 1-0 lead.

Midfielder Frank Bruno put Syracuse up 2-1
early in the second half with his team—best fourth
goal of the season. The play was set up by a pass
from midﬁelder Ilias Calaitzidis. Calaitzidis crossed

the ball to Bruno, who shot the ball just inside the

post for the go—ahead goal at 51:57.

Each team registered 11 shots on the day, with
Brush and Calaitzidis each recording five shots
apiece.

Lowery made four saves in the game, and fin-
ished the season with his sixth career win. Lowery
started all 18 games for the Panthers this season,

with a 1.82 goals—against average. He made 88 saves
on the season and recorded four shutouts.

“Good way to finish [the season],” Luxbacher
said.

Luxbacher explained that although this season
was_disappointing record—wise, they should be com-
petitive next year. He, spoke of his young players
who will be returning next year, and how he expects
them to come out next year with more knowledge of

the game. They will begin training in January for the

2004 season.

“Hopefully they learned [that] Big East soccer is
the best there is,” Luxbacher said.

Since the Panthers were eliminated from playoff
contention in their last game, the game against
Syracuse meant nothing in terms of standings, but it
did serve specialmeaning to one player in particular.

It was Clay Haﬂich’s last collegiate start for Pitt.
The senior defenseman did not record a shot or an
assist in the game, however. It was his 71st consecu-
tive start in a career that featured six’ goals, two
assists and numerous defensive plays that kept the
ball out of the Panther goal. ‘ ' .

“Clay has been a’ rock for us,” Luxbacher said.
“As a leader and a captain, we have never had.any—
one like him. We’ll miss him tremendously.”

Harris was also impressed

--:1» with the work of his secondary

players, who almost intercepted
Eagle quarterback Quinton Porter
on three occasions. As for that
shaky first drive, which ended
with three points for Boston
College, Harris placed some of the
blame on technology.

“On the opening drive, our
defensive coaches lost our
phones,” he said. “We lost com-
munication.”

While Pitt has exorcised some
demons the last two weeks with
wins at home against Syracuse and
at Boston College, it will be the
Panthers’ opponent this week that

_ will be looking to reverse a trend.

6»)

Despite being underdogs in
every game, the Panthers are 3-3
against the Virginia Tech Hokies
under Walt Harris and have won
two straight in the series, includ-
ing last season’s 28-21 victory in
Blacksburg, Va.

The Hokies feature a deadly
running attack, which is led by
running back Kevin Jones. ’

Jones has run for 904 yards
and 10 touchdowns this year and,
along with Fitzgerald," is a
Heisman Trophy candidate. '

Harris knows the importance,
and the difficulty of containing

Jones and the Hokie ground
attack.

“We (don’t have anyone that
runs as ‘fast as [Jones] does,” he
said.

Pitt may catch a break this
week_, with Virginia Tech-defen-
sive back and punt returner,
DeAngelo Hall suspended for the
first half of the game as punish-
ment for his ejection against
Miami last week. Still, Harris
knows that the Hokies present a
challenge on special teams.

“We have not been successful,
like a lot of teams, against.-the
kicking game of Virginia Tech,”
Harris said. .

Pitt will try to make it three in
a row against the Hokies in front
of a sold-out crowd and on nation‘-
al television. To top it off, ESPN’s
College GameDay will make its

j first-ever appearance at a Panther

game.
Harris is thrilled about the

. excitement surrounding the game

but knows that it is up to his team
to take care of business" on the
field. ‘

“I think all the peripheral
things are nice. It will help
recruiting, but we'got to play
good,” Harris said. “We’ve played
in front of a couple’ of sell-out
crowds here and haven’t gotten
the job done.”

Volleyball, page 14

game one 30-22. But this time, the
Panthers responded with three
straight victories with scores of 30-
24, 30-26, and 30-23, to win the
match 3-1. _ .

The Hurricanes’ loss was their
first-ever home defeat against a Big
East conference opponent.

Hatlestad led Pitt’s attack with
season-highs of 27 kills and three
service aces. .

Rollman and Miller each had
double-doubles for the Panthers,
with 15 kills and 15 digs, and 14
kills‘ and 10 digs, respectively.

~ Miller also tied for the team-high

with six total blocks.

L Freshman setter Azadeh
Boroumand, who saw. her first sig-
nificant action of the season, con-

tributed a match-high 54 assists.

“We needed a spark — we were
kind of lifeless in the first game —
and [Boroumand] provided it,”
Beerman said. “It’s a pretty big thing
for a freshman to go into there and
step it up like that, and it just uplift-
ed the whole team. It was a really
fun thing to watch.”

Outside , hitter Kim Norris
chipped in with eight digs and a
career-best six block assists, while
McGrane added a team-high 17 digs.
