Domestic partner health beneﬁts okayed

itt will begin offering

health insurance ben-

eﬁts for same—sex and
opposite—sex domestic partners
of employees Jan. 1.

Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg announced the decision
yesterday in a Sept. 1 campus
update.

The University has been
embroiled in litigation over the
issue since January 1996, when
an employee ﬁled suit against
Pitt, charging that Pitt’s denial
of same—sex beneﬁts violated
a city ordinance prohibiting
discrimination based on sexual
orientation. Six other employees
later joined the suit.

In yesterday’s update, Nor-
denberg noted. that nearly 80
percent of the Association of
American Universities and two-

   

  ,.109..,_.coII_1

employers, now offer domestic
partner beneﬁts. He cited Pitt’s
need “to protect our position in
increasingly competitive markets
for top talent.”

Pitt becomes the ﬁrst Penn-
sylvania state-related univer-
sity to offer subsidized health
insurance beneﬁts to domestic
partners of its employees, the
chancellor noted. “However, a
number of colleges and univer-
sities with direct commonwealth
appropriations do provide such

eneﬁts.”

In  the
decision, Nordenberg
cited Pitt’s need “to
protect our position ‘m
increasingly competitive
markets for top talent.”

The chancelloracknowledged
that the debate over providing
partner health benefits here
dates back more than a decade,
including “legal claims that Pitt
was engaged in discriminatory
practices,” charges “that were
rejected by the court,” Norden-
berg wrote.

Christine Biancheria, attor-
ney for the plaintiffs, said: “We
applaud the change in Pitt’s
policy. We applaud the Univer-
sity recognizing the importance
of equal employee beneﬁts. It’s
better late than never.”

However, she added, “This
announcement will not necessar-
ily end all litigation. I’ll need to
discuss this development with
my clients. But they have suf-

fered over a long time as a result
of denied beneﬁts.”

Oral arguments are scheduled
for Oct. 6 on the plaintiffs’ appeal
of a January ruling by Allegheny
County Common Pleas Judge
Robert Gallo. In that ruling,
Gallo permanently barred the
Pittsburgh Human Relations
Commission from hearing the
discrimination complaint against
Pitt, saying the commission lacks
jurisdiction to hear the case.

Two plaintiffs who spoke to
the University Times said they
felt vindicated by Pitt’s actions
in offering the beneﬁts.

Plaintiff Ray Anne Lockard,’

head of the Frick Fine Arts
Librar>ssaéd.f‘I’mv h ppy-I’m
way I read this, the beneﬁts will
be offered to opposite—sex domes-
tic partners as well, because that’s
the way it should be. I’m pleased
that Pitt ﬁnally came around to
offering these beneﬁts.”

Plaintiff Bruce Venarde, asso-
ciate professor of history, said,
“This is marvelous news. The
chancellor has chosen to agree
with the arguments presented in
the lawsuit, after all this money
was spent over almost nine years,
to bring the University up to the
standards of our peer universities
and national corporations.”

Both Lockard and Venarde
declined comment on further
legal action, pending discus-
sions with their attorney and
fellow plaintiffsb

 
 

A committee appointed in
2001 by the chancellor to advise
him on the issue predicted that
domestic partner health insur-
ance eventually would be the
norm among major employers,
including higher education insti-
tutions. The committee recom-
mended offering the beneﬁts, but
at some future date.

The committee concluded
in its ﬁnal recommendations
in April 2002 that offering the
health beneﬁts at Pitt “would
not be prudent” at that time
because “the prospect of a
harmful confrontation with the
.[state] legislature” might affect
Pitt’s state appropriation, among
other deterrents.

Committee chairman Wil-
liam Lieberman, a Pitt trustee,
said yesterday, “Naturally, we’re
concerned about the [reaction of]
the legislature, but the chancellor

felt, and I think rightly so, that
this was the appropriate move to
make at this time. I think Chan-
cellor Nordenberg exhibited
great leadership in this matter.”

Pitt’s chief spokesperson
Robert Hill told the University
Times yesterday, “We have no
assurances from the leadership
in Harrisburg on this decision.
We have kept them informed,
and we hope that they respect
the University’s decision, which
we believe was the right one to
make at this time.”

Lieberman’s committee also
recommended that Nordenberg
work with presidents of the
other state-related universities
to present a united front to the

update, Nordenberg’s efforts to
build a consensus — “a common

“We applaud the

the importance of equal
employee beneﬁts,”
Biancheria said.

solution” — among Pennsylva-
nia’s state-related institutions
failed because “each institution
in that group is different from the
others in a range of meaningful
ways.”

As to the potential cost to the
University of the new health ben-
eﬁt, Hill said there is no way to
predict costs with accuracy. “This
is new to us. We’ve looked at other
institutions that have offered
these beneﬁts, and typically,
there are many more opposite—sex
domestic partners than same—sex
domestic partners [who sign up
for these beneﬁts.] But we really
do not know.”

Other considerations out-
weigh costs, Hill said. “We’re in
a time and place where people
ask about beneﬁts in making
their employment decisions. It
is an important consideration.
This takes that off the table in

negotiations.”

Under the new guidelines
outlined in Nordenberg’s
update: “Employees must
demonstrate the existence of a
domestic partner relationship
by ﬁling an afﬁdavit of domestic
partnership.”

According to the update, Ur1i-
versity policies deﬁne a domestic
partner relationship as a commit-
ted and sustained relationship
between two adults, character-
ized by speciﬁed examples of
the interrningling of ﬁnancial
resources and responsibilities.
Those include joint ownership
of residential property and des-
ignation of one’s domestic parmer

“Eligible Pitt employees

N ordenberg stated.

A memorial service will be
held for W. Edward Sell, Distin-
guished Service Professor of Law
emeritus and law dean emeritus,
on Sept. 12 at 2 p.m. in Heinz
Chapel, followed by a reception
in the School of Law lobby.

Sell, the longest—serving fac-
ulty member in the law school’s
history, died Aug. 15, 2004, at
his home in Mt. Lebanon. He
was 81.

“It’s a terrible shock and a
great loss to the law school,”
said law Dean David]. Herring.
“Ed was in good health, and
in the best spirits I’d ever seen
him in, ready to teach three
courses this fall and a full load
again in the spring. It’s amazing
how much the students miss his
presence already, especially our
top students on the Law Review,
where he was an adviser. And they
miss him not just because of his
teaching, but because of the kind
of person he was, so committed
to students.”

Born on New Year’s Day, 1923,
in Hanover, Pa., Sell’s under-
graduate years were interrupted
in 1943 with his service in the
United States Army Air Corps.
He received a B.A. magna cum
laude, with honors in economics,
from Washington and Jefferson
College in 1944. He earned his

].D. at Yale Law School in 1947.
He also held honorary degrees
from W81] (1973) and Dickinson
School of Law (1968).
Joining the Pitt law faculty
in 1947 as an instructor, Sell
rose through the academic and
administrative ranks as assistant
professor (1949-1951), associate
professor (1 95 3- 195 4), professor
(1954-1977), associate law dean
(1957-1962), dean (1966-1977),
Distinguished Service Professor
of Law (1977-1994) and dean
emeritus (1994).

He also served as an attorney
forU.S.Steel Corp.(1951-1953),
as a visiting professor at the
University of Michigan School
of Law in summer 195 7 and as
senior counsel to Meyer, Unkovic
8: Scott, 1977-1997.

Sell’s primary area of teaching
and scholarship was in corporate
law, and he became known as the
father of Pennsylvania’s modern

business corporation statute.
That designation Wasn’t hyper-
bole, Herring said. “Ed was the
primary author of the Pennsyl-
vania corporate code.”

He also wrote several books

and scholarly articles on corpo-
rate law, including a three-volume
work, “Pennsylvania Business
Corporations,” published in
1969, that is still considered a
standard within the Pennsylva-
nia legal community.

Sell taught courses such
as Corporate Finance, Sales,
Accounting for Lawyers, and
Agency and Partnership. His
teaching was recognized with
the law school’s 1986 Excel-
lence in Teaching Award and the
University-wide 1990 President’s
(now Chancel1or’s) Distinguished
Teaching Award.

According to Chancellor
Mark A. Nordenberg, Sell is
credited as the driving force
behind the law building, which
was dedicated in 1976 during
his tenure as dean. “He was a
strong advocate who overcame
the reservations held by the [Pitt]
administration at that time, as
well as of those in Harrisburg,
convincing them of the need for
a new building for the school,”
said Nordenberg, one of Sell’s
successors as law dean before
becoming Pitt chancellor. “Ed
also was an innovator, reaching
out to alunmi groups for ﬁnan-
cial support at a time before
deans typically got into that.
The new building became the
launching pad for the modern
Pitt law school and permitted
the expansion of programs and
improvement in quality that we
see the effects of today.”

Nordenberg said that over
a quarter—century relationship
the two became close friends.

“During my ﬁrst year (1977) at
Pitt as visiting assistant profes-
sor of law, Ed took an interest in
me and we developed a very close
friendship. VVhen I became dean
[in 1986] he was a great supporter
and a source of advice, sometimes
sought by me privately and some-
times at his initiation. He knew
the challenges that being dean
presented. He also had a great
sense of humor and loved to
tell a good joke. He would say,
with a twinkle in his eye, ‘You
know, Mark, I joined this faculty
a year before you were born...’”
as though anyone would question
his knowledge and experience,
Nordenberg said.

The chancellor added that
Sell’s dedication to the law school
took several forms. “He showed
a great commitment to students.
And he showed how faculty mem-
bers at a professional school
should meaningfully engage in
the profession.”

As an example, Nordenberg
said that Sell and he co-directed
a trial advocacy forum for practic-
ing attorneys where local lawyers
were brought in to critique stu-
dents’ performance in moot court
and other presentations.

Sell also wrote the history of
the School of Law, titled “The
Law Down: A Century Remem-
bered,” which was underwritten
by the Obernauer Foundation
and published in 1995, the
school’s centennial year.

Sell held several positions of
leadership in the Pennsylvania
Bar Association (PBA), includ-
ing chair of its editorial board,
corporations committee chair
and member of the House of
Delegates. In 1995, he received
a PBA citation for special achieve-

ment.

Sell was a member of numer-
ous organizations, including
Phi Beta Kappa, the American
Law Institute (life member),
the American Bar Foundation
(life member), the American
Bar Association, the Allegheny
County Bar Association and the
Pennsylvania Society.

An ordained elder at South-
minster Presbyterian Church,
Sell taught adult Bible classes.
He also was active in community
affairs, serving on a number of
boards of directors, including
boards of St. Clair Memorial
Hospital, St. Clair Health Corp.,
St Clair Foundation and Little
Lake Theatre Co.

But Sell’s deepest feelings
and dedication were reserved for
Pitt’s law school, Herring said.
“Ed came into my ofﬁce practi-
cally every morning to offer his
insights or just share a joke. One
line I heard him say a number of
times: ‘Old deans don’t die. They
just lose their faculties.’ He was a
mentor to me and someone who
always had the best interests of
the law school at heart.”

Sell was preceded in death
by his wife of 52 years, Corde-
lia, and by his sister, Henrietta
VV1lliams. He is survived by his
sonjeffrey E. Sell and daughter-
in—law Christine, of Baltimore;
two granddaughters, Peggy and
Bridget; a grandson,]effrey, and
his sister Eleanor Sheeley ofYork
County.

Julia Ann Thompson

Julia Ann Thompson, pro-
fessor of physics, 61, died in an
automobile accident in Wood
River, Ill., on Aug. 16, 2004.

She always had a mix of stu-
dent papers and research papers
with her in the hallways. And she
wore her hair in pigtails for ease
and efﬁciency, said one former
student.

According to colleagues and
students, Thompson wanted to
see physics come to life, not just
in her research, but also in her
teaching and outreach to women
and other minorities.

A graduate of Cornell College
in Iowa and Yale University, she
joined Pitt’s Department of
Physics and Astronomy faculty
in 1972, specializing in experi-
mental elementary particle
physics.

“One of her goals was to get
diversity involved in science
— she was an awesome instruc-
tor and awesome mentor,” said
Nichelle Madison, 20, a Pitt
senior majoring in physics, math
and political science.

Madison traveled with
Thompson to perform physics
demonstrations for underprivi-
leged students in the Capetown
area of South Africa in 2003.

Madison and Thompson used
simple props like tuning forks and
Slinkys for their demonstrations.
“Students didn’twant to go lunch,
they stayed,” Madison said. So
did the Slinkys and other props,
which were greatly desired by the
South African teachers after the

demonstrations. r e tn e m b e r s

at sunset. “Then
she would cook
for us,” Madison
remembered.
“We didn’t go
to restaurants
thatmuch—this
Wasn’t a vacation to her. She had
a work ethic that was through the
roof.”

Thompson founded and
directed the REUP-FOM
(Research Experiences for
Undergraduates in Physics-
Focus on Minorities), a summer
program at Pitt for students
from both inside and outside
the University. The program
placed undergraduate students
in research groups during the
summer months. Supported by
the National Science Foundation,
REUP-FOM achieved a minor-
ityparticipationof60—80percent.
More than half the students in the
program were females. In 2001
and 2002 Thompson directed
a sister site of the program at
Southern Illinois University in
Edwardsville.

fessor emeritus Wilfred Cleland,

“She believed.
She was pas-
sionate. She
wasn’t doing
it out of some
sense of duty.
She wanted
to make life
better for the
disadvantaged.
It was public
service with a capital ‘P,”’ Cleland
said. In addition, Thompson was

a brilliant teacher and researcher, .

he said.

ClelandworkedwithThomp—
son on collaboration projects
with as many as 300 scholars in
a group. “Everybody had their
specialty and did their particular
part of the experiment. Her area
was data analysis. She would take
analysis, 11111 through computer
programs and reduce it into
meaningful results. This is what
she liked to do. Everybody had
to do some fraction of this for
his or her thesis. She was very
careful, very methodical -— it was
work requiring you not to make
mistakes.”

During her career she partici-
pated in experiments at several
particle accelerator laboratories:
BrookhavenNationalLaboratory
on Long Island, N.Y., CERN in
Geneva, Switzerland and the

Budker Institute of Nuclear
Physics in Novosibirsk, Russia.
Recently she had begun work
on an experiment at F ermilab in
Batavia, Ill. Over the years she
worked with several international
collaborations, ranging in size
from a few physicists to several
hundred. She made contribu-
tions to many of the important
topics in experimental particle
physics, published more than
100 scientiﬁc papers and was a
frequent speaker at international
conferences.

In 2003, she was appointed
adjunct professor of physics at
the University of Missouri at St.
Louis, where she initiated phys-
ics outreach activities to the local
high schools. This workis carried
out as part of the Quark Net pro-
gram, a national effort with the
goal to make elementary particle
physics accessible to high school
teachers and studenm across the
United States. Her experimental
research at Pitt provided access to
the Quark Net program.

Thompson is survived by
her husband, David E. Kraus,
formerly a researcher at Pitt.
Kraus also was injured in the
car crash.

Other survivors include her
parents, Erwin and Ruth Thomp—
son, of Godfrey, Ill., and two chil-
dren, Diane Thompson, also of
Godfrey, and Vincent Szewczyk,
of Bamhart, Mo.

University is being plarmed.

SEPTEMBER 2, 2004

Described as a rigorous
teacher and scholar, Hector
Correa, 74, died unexpectedly
in his Forrest Hills home on
Aug. 23, 2004.

He was a professor of public
and urban affairs at Pitt for 34
years, with joint appointments in
the schools of public health and
education. He was also director
of the Latin American Seminar
in ProjectDesign, Evaluation and
Implementation.

His areas of expertise included
the utilization of quantitative
methods and computers for
policy analysis, project and
program design, evaluation and
implementation.

One of Correa’s former
students, Kevin Kearns, a Pitt
associate professor of public
and nonprofit management,
remembered Correa as a rigor-
ous teacher in his GSPIA classes
in the late 1970s.

“Hector had the kind of course
you may have not liked when you
were in it. But when you got out
of school, you really appreciated
that class,” Kearns said.

Correa had high expectations
in the classroom that “pushed
us toward higher standards
of achievement and hopefully
excellence,” Kearns said. He was
also the kind of teacher alumni
the world over would ask about,
he said.

Hector Correa

“He used to terrify students
in the classroom,” Kearns said,
“but he had a great deal of human
caring.”

When Kearns became a
GSPIA faculty member, he had
the opportunity to see Correa
as a colleague with an incredible
work ethic. “No matter what time
of the day or day of the week,
you wouldn’t be surprised to see
Hector in GSPIA. He was avail-
able to students and dedicated to
his research.”

Many faculty and staff
remember Correa’s kind and
gentle demeanor.

“He was a quiet guy who
worked hard and people liked
him,” said GSPIA professor
Donald Goldstein.

“Hector always said he would
never retire and he didn’t, ironi-
cally,” Goldstein said. “Even

Brenda Berrian, professor
of Africana studies, remembers
Sizemore as an extraordinarily
dedicated teacher. “She was
convinced all students could get

students the chance to earn an
“A,” Sizemore put in long hours
tutoring her students.

Berrian characterized Size-

Robert J. A. Pratt, former
head of the Greensburg campus
management department and
a former professor at the Katz
Graduate School of Business in
Oakland, died Aug. 3, 2004. He
was 74 and had retired from UPG
in fall 2003.

Pratt’s legacy at UPG
includes the establishment of
the Robert J.A. Pratt Endowed
Student Resource Fund. The
fund provides selected students
in the Department of Manage-
ment with tuition assistance and
assistance for books, travel or
emergencies.

“Bob was a teacher who not
only excited students about
his subject, but also inspired
great devotion and fondness.
Years after they graduated, his
students still remembered both
his insights and his foibles,” said
Frank A. Cassell, president of
Pitt-Greensburg.

Carl F. Poke, professor of
political science, was the aca-
demic dean at Pitt-Greensburgin
1982 , when Pratt began teaching
there full time after teaching for
20 years at the Katz school.

“There was a period when he
was teaching at the Katz Graduate
School of Business and teaching
part tirne for us,” Poke said. “We
  to. move toward

the business program was the
largest single program in terms

Robert]. A. Pratt

of enrollment. We felt we needed
a full—time person in business,
and Dr. Pratt looked like a good
choice because he had developed
the undergraduate major that
Oakland had.”

Poke remembered Pratt as
someone who developed a rela-
tionship with his students based
on respect. “Among business stu-
dents, over time, he developed an
image as being very difficult in
terms of setting solid academic
standards, but, at the same time,
he was a compassionate human
being,” Poke said. “He applied
standards uniformly, and he
didn’t play favorites.”

Jason Gongaware, president
of the Pitt-Greensburg Alumni
Association and one of Pratt’s
former students, recalled Pratt
as being respected not only in
the academic community but
also in the business world.

“He was able to provide
students with real-world expe-
rience,” Gongaware said. “He
impacted students from the
beginning of his career until he
retired.”

Pratt’s teaching style and per-
sonality remained with students
long after graduation. “Among
Pitt-Greensburg alumni, he was
one of the most popular and the
mos_t asked—about professors,”
hieisaid.-‘~ 2 .         - . .

Gongaware fondly recalled
Pratt as “a real character.”

“VVhen you asked him how he
was doing, his standard answer,
no matter what, was ‘Terrible,’”
Gongaware said.

Will Hoffman, a ﬁnancial
planner from Greensburg,
graduated in 2001 with a degree
in business. Like Gongaware,
he remembered Pratt’s distinc-
tive personality.

“ [Pratt] definitely had a style
that was different from everyone
else’s,” Hoffman said. “I only had
him for three classes, and I really
began to appreciate his teaching
methods once I had a chance to
apply them.”

Pratt graduated from Carn-
egie Institute ofTechnology as an
electrical engineer and received
his M.B.A. from Carnegie Tech
in 1960.

From 1953 to 1957, he served
in the U.S. Air Force and was in
the Strategic Air Command as a
navigator on a B-47 aircraft.

He was the editor of the Pitts-
burgh Business Review, which is
no longer published.

Pratt is survived by Laura, his
wife of 49 years; three daughters,
and five grandchildren.

Effect of new federal
overtime pay rule
changes at Pitt unclear

Pitt staff will gain or lose
overtime pay under a new
federal labor rule.

An updated overtime rule in
the Federal Fair Labor Standards
Act took effect Aug. 23, poten-
tially impacting about 6.7 million
workers and their eligibility for
overtime pay, according to the
US. Department of Labor.

The new rule expands the
number of workers eligible for
overtime pay, according to the
labor department. For example,
workers paid less than $23,660 or
$455 per week are now guaran-
teed overtime regardless of their
titles or duties.

“The impact is fairly nominal
at Pitt,” said Ron Frisch, associ-
ate vice chancellor for human

It’s too early to know if any

resources. “I don’t expect signiﬁ-
cant changes. Our compensation
system is clean and accurate. It’s
been challenged and reviewed by
the Staff Association Council,”
be said.

Human Resources overhauled
its job classiﬁcation system and
pay ranges in 1999.

Human Resources will review
the classiﬁcations of approxi-
mately 6,750 full-time and part-
time staff to check compliance
with the new federal rules. The
review should take abouta year,
Frisch said.

Results of the review, accord-
ing to Frisch, will be reported to
University administrators.

One reason that the new rule
might not have a big impact at
Pitt is because the state has its

own set of labor laws, which are
more speciﬁc than the federal
rules, explained Frisch.

According to state Labor
& Industry Secretary Stephen
M. Schmerin, “The bulk of
workers will get the beneﬁts
of the changes to the federal
standard, without the negative
impact because an employer
must pay overtime if either
the new federal overtime rules
or Pennsylvania law requires
overtime payment.”

The new law is “admittedly
still somewhat confusing,”
Frisch said.

He expects some adjust-
ment time for the new rules,
as public and legal debates play
out nationally.

ULS touts speedy new search engine

Q can Zoom through a
research topic elec-

tronically?

Zoom, a custom-made search
engine for the University Library
System (ULS), debuted on Aug.
25. Users need only go to the
library’s homepage and click on
“Zoom.” Enter a topic to search
and within seconds, Zoom
produces a list of academic and
popular citations culled from ﬁve
popular databases.

For more extensive searches,
the new system can check the
library’s 400 or so databases and
electronic journals simultane-
ously.

“It’s going to shorten a user’s

director. “It does what Google
does but for licensed databases.”
Licensed databases are available
mostly through paid subscrip-

tions.

Google with academic quality
results,” said VV1sniewski. Quality
means peer-reviewed academic
journals, full—text newspapers,
transcripts from news organiza-
tions and popular information

sources such as Time, Newsweek
and USA Today.
In fact, .,,Z0om focuses on



scription-based databanks
— information niches not cov-
ered by popular Internet search
engines.

Online magazine noted the

difference between Google and
a search engine such as Zoom
in its March-April 2004 issue:
“Google, for the general public,
sets the gold standard for return-
ing relevant results. Federated
search (such as Zoom) offers
another opportunity for librar-
ies to out—Google Google, this

time by returning relevant results

that Google misses.”

How Zoom works: Say a
library user wants to search for
“ﬁrst lady. ” Enter those keywords
into a Google search and up pop
8.7 million hits. Users can ponder
an exhausting list of everything
“ﬁrst lady,” from the ofﬁcial
White House web site to an eBay
advertisement hawking “Great

Search for ﬁrst lady now.’ ”
Enter “First Lady” in Zoom
and 15,000 hits appear broken
down into ﬁve databases. The
database “ArticleFirst” holds

of new items by e-mail. ’ 

477 articles referencing “ﬁrst
lady.” A quick glance at one of
the database’s citations includes,
“An ‘improbable leap’: a content
analysis of newspaper coverage of
Hillary Clinton ’s transition from
ﬁrst lady to senate candidate,”
from Communication Abstracts,
2003, Vol. 26, issue 1.

Faculty and students famil-
iar with speciﬁc journals can
still access individual journals
electronically. But new search
options with Zoom include sub-
ject speciﬁc search pages; a quick
link feature using ULS’ ﬁve larg-
est and broadest databases, and a
“select all” database feature.

Coming this spring, library
users can save searches, then set
them to repeat at regular intervals

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Pitt moves up 1 place

in US. News rankings

itt tied for 66th among
P the nation’s Ph.D .—grant-
ing universities, and for
2 6th among such public universi-
ties, in the U.S. News & World
Report’s 21st annual “best col-
leges” rankings. Pitt’s placement
in each category is up one spot
from last year.

Tied with Pitt in the 26th slot
among public institutions were
the universities of Connecticut,
Delaware and Minnesota—Twin
Cities.

The same four institutions
tied for 66th among all doctorate-
granting national universities,
248 schools in all (162 public,
86 private).

Three years ago Pitt ranked
39th on the U.S. News list for
publics, while two years ago the
University was ranked 31st.

Last year Pitt ranked 67th
overall; in the previous two years,
Pitt ﬁnished in the second tier,
Nos. 50 — 125 plus ties, which the
magazine listed alphabetically.

The top spot among all
schools this year was jointly
held by Harvard and Princeton,
with Yale ranked 3rd, the same
as last year.

The University of Califor-
nia-Berkeley held the top spot
among the publics at No. 21
overall, followed by the Uni-
versity of Michigan-Ann Arbor
and the University of Virginia,
which tied for 2nd among the
public universities and for 22nd
among all institutions.

Pennsylvania institutions
ranked among the top 50 national
universities/doctoral were the
University of Pennsylvania (4th
overall), Carnegie Mellon (tied
for 22nd), Lehigh University
(tied for 37th) and Penn State
University (tied for 50th).

The overall college ratings
were published in the Aug. 30
issue of the magazine in abridged
form. Undergraduate business
and engineering programs, as
well as certain specialty areas and
programs ranked by U.S. News
are posted at the magazine’s web
site: www.usnews.com.

The extended rankings lists,
which were the source for this
story, can be purchased on-line
at the web site.

Kinds of institutions

U.S. News breaks down the
nation’s 1,444 national institu-
tions (935 private, 509 public)
into several categories: “national
universitiesl doctoral,” “national
liberal arts colleges/bachelor’s,”
“regional universities/master’s”
and “regional comprehensive
colleges/bachelor’s.”

Nationaluniversities/doctoral
is deﬁned by U.S. News as those
that offer a “full range of under-
graduate majors, as well as mas-
ter’s and doctoral degrees; many
strongly emphasize research.”

The categories, developed by
the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, were
adopted three years ago by U.S.
News.

The magazine has ranked col-
leges annually since 1983.

Methodology

U.S News annually gath-
ers data from the institutions.
According to the magazine, 95 .2
percent of the schools returned
surveys supplying data for this
year’s rankings. Missing data
are drawn from national sources
such as the American Association
of University Professors and the
U.S. Department of Education’s
National Center for Educational
Statistics.

The rankings for national
universities/ doctoral are derived
from a comparison of seven indi-
cators: academic reputation based
on peer assessment (25 percent
of total score), graduation and
retention rates (20 percent),
faculty resources (20 percent),
student selectivity (15 percent),
ﬁnancial resources (10 percent),
alumni giving (5 percent) and
graduation rate performance (5
percent).

The last indicator, graduation
rate performance, is deﬁned as
the difference between a school’s

six-year graduation rate for the "
class that entered in 1997 and 

the predicted rate for that class; *
the predicted rate is calculated
using a formula that accounts
for the standardized tests scores
of 1997-entering students and
the school’s expenditures on the
students.

If the actual graduation rate
is higher than the predicted rate,
the school is judged to have
enhanced the students’ achieve-
ment. For example, Pitt’s pre-
dicted six-year graduation rate
was 59 percent, while the actual
count was 65 percent, according
to the magazine.

Selected rankings

' Pitt’s Johnstown campus
again was ranked 3rd in the
northern region among public
schools in the sub—category
of comprehensive colleges/
bachelor’s, that is, those public
institutions that focus on under-
graduate education and offer a
range of degree programs in
professional ﬁelds such as busi-
ness, nursing and education, with
liberal arts accounting for fewer
than half of the bachelor’s degrees
awarded.

Nationally, U.S. News ranks
324 public and private com-
prehensive colleges/bachelor’s,
divided by four regions of the
country. In the northern region
there are 69 schools (14 public,
5 5 private) in this cate gory. Over-
all, Pitt-Johnstown ranked in the
third tier, Nos. 36 - 5 2, which the
magazine lists alphabetically.

The top spot in the northern
region for all comprehensive
colleges/bachelor’s was main-
tained by Stonehill College, a
private institution in Massachu-
setts. The top public school was
Ramapo College of New Jersey,
which was tied for 9th overall.

° Undergraduate business
and engineering programs on
the Pittsburgh campus also were

ranked nationally by U.S. News
and World Report.

Among the 375 accredited
undergraduate business pro-
grams nationally, Pitt’s under-
grad business program tied for
38th (tied for 23rd among public
universities).

Wharton busi-

spot overall in this category.

To arrive at the rankings,
U.S. News surveyed deans and
senior faculty at undergraduate
business programs accredited
by the Association to Advance
Collegiate Schools of Business.
Participants were asked to rate
the quality of all programs they
are familiar with on a scale of 1
(marginal) to 5 (distinguished).
The rankings are based solely on
this peer survey; 46 percent of
those surveyed responded.

° Among the 145 accredited
undergraduate engineering pro-
grams for universities that grant
Ph.D.s, Pitt’s program tied for
60th with 13 other institutions; it
tied for 33rd with 11 other schools
among public universities.

Carnegie Mellon ﬁnished tied
for 8th and Penn State tied for
16th overall in the engineering
program rankings.

Undergrad engineering pro-
grams are ranked solely on the
judgments of surveyed deans
and senior faculty who rated
each program they are familiar
with. Sixty percent of those sur-
veyed responded, according to
the magazine.

° In addition, U.S. News
included Pitt this year among
“programs to look for,” which
lists “outstanding examples of
academic programs that are
believed to lead to student suc-
cess.”

Pitt is among institutions
of higher learning nationwide
that excel in their “writing in
the disciplines” undergraduate
programs. According to the
magazine, “These colleges typi-
cally make writin g a priority at all
levels of instruction and across the

curriculum.” Fifteen other insti-
tutions nationally were similarly
recognized.

° Pitt improved from 8th to
12th among national public uni-
versities in the category of “most
debt” incurred by its graduates.

U.S. News annually ranks
institutions using data drawn
from the universities themselves,
ﬁnancial institutions, and from
federal, state and local govern-
ments. The data indicate 1)what
percentage of the student body
has taken on debt at graduation,
and 2) the “average amount of
debt,” that is, the average cumula-
tive amount borrowed by those
students who incurred
debt, not the
average

institutions on the “most debt”
list, improving from 2 7th overall
last year.

Temple, with 69 percent of its
students incurring an average of
$22,041, was 4th among public
universities and 29th overall;
CMU (52 percent, $21,235) ﬁn-
ished 37th on the “most debt” list.
Penn (43 percent, $19,579) was
5 7th among all national schools.
Penn State (70 percent, $18,200)
was 82nd overall and 36th among
public universities.

Center recognized for
research, clinical care

UPMC’s Amyotrophic Lat-
eral Sclerosis (ALS) program has
been designated as an MDA/ALS
Center by the Muscular Dystro-
phy Association in recognition
of its excellence in research and
clinical care.

UPMC is one of 33 centers
in the count:ry to receive the
designation.

Better known as Lou Gehrig’s
Disease, the disease most com-
monly strikes people between
the ages of 40 and 70. As many
as 30,000 Americans have the
disease at any given time.

Pitt’s ALS program is headed
by David Lacomis, associate pro-
fessor of neurology and pathol-
ogy and chief of the Division of
Neuromuscular Diseases of the
Department of Neurology.

Pittsburgh’s clinical services
include a multidisciplinary

approach with two neurologists
who specialize in ALS, a nurse
practitioner/clinic coordinator,
nutritionist, physical therapist,
occupational therapist, social
worker, specialist in internal
medicine and palliative care,
and medical equipment and
speech communication assistive
device consultants. ‘

Also, Pittsburgh is part of the
Northeastern ALS Consortium
for ALS Clinical Trials. Cur-
rently, Lacomis and his team are
completing a trial of Celebrex and
expect to participate in a study of
an antibiotic early next year.

In addition, a team of
researchers under the direction of
Robert Bowser, associate profes-
sor of pathology, is participating
in an ALS biomarkers study with
investigators at Massachusetts
General Hospital. I

CSSD offers VPN, software update services

wo new free computer-
related services for Pitt
faculty, staff and students

now are up and running.
“We’re offering a secure VPN
(virtual private network) service
that replaces the service previ-
ously provided by Stargate for
secure access to the University’s
network, and a new software
update service that automati-
cally installs the latest security
updates and service packs as
soon as they become available

from Microsoft,” said Jinx P.
Walton, director of Computing
Services and Systems Develop-
ment (CSSD).

Authorized Pitt account hold-
ers can access restricted on—line
resources, such as library jour-
nals, databases and application
software, from any off-campus
location free of charge.

There are a number of ser-
vices that the University wants
to restrict to authorized Pitt
users, Walton explained. “Some

of these restrictions are in place
because of licensing agreements;
others are for security reasons.
The library, for example, signs
agreements that certain journals
will be used only by members of
the University community.”

Pitt’s new VPN service is a
gateway that veriﬁes and authen-
ticates users, using the central
directory, she said.

Walton cautioned that the
new service still requires an infor-
mation service provider (ISP).

Day of Caring set for Sept. 14

his year’s Day of Caring,

I Sept. 14, features many

projects inspired by the
interests of Pitt staff.

“We’ve moving away from
just picking a project from a
catalogue supplied by United
Way,” says Steve Zupcic, one
of the coordinators for the 14th
annual Pitt/United Way Day of
Caring. The volunteer effort is
more customized to the needs
of an organization and to Pitt’s
resources, Zupcic said.

For example, this year Equi-
pose, a University organization
of African—American faculty and
staff, initiated the inclusion of
four volunteer sites for Pitt’s
Day of Caring:

° A reading project at the
Urban League Charter School
in East Liberty.

° Assistance with activities
for the residents of the Leming—
ton Home for the Aged in the

 :
services at thejob Links ofﬁce in
Oakland.

0 Help with job search skills
for women in transitional living
at the Alma IlleryMedical Center
in Homewood.

Many of Pitt’s Day of Caring
projects are ﬁlled, according to
Zupcic. “We’ve been so successful
in recruitingvolunteers this year,
there is just one project that could
use only a few more people, ‘Keep
it Clean Oakland.” The cleanup
project is sponsored with Oak-
land Planning and Development
Corp. —- a grassroots organiza-
tion dedicated to improving the
quality of life in Oakland neigh-
borhoods. "

More than 300 Pitt employ-
ees have volunteered for Day of
Caring projects with the Univer-
sity, according to Zupcic.

VVhen faculty and staff orga-
nizations identify sites in need of
help, there’s more “of a commit-
ment to a high quality of work
during the Day of Caring and
it leads to continued volunteer
effort throughout the year,”
Zupcic said.

There are other stories of

The service replaces Stargate’s
“VPN-only service”; it does not
provide such options as higher
speed DSL, for example.

She noted: “The new service
just uses a web browser, so it
does not require a client to be
installed on the computer, and
it is free.”

Walton noted that Pitt’s 800
modern pool continues as an
option for Pitt users who wish
to access the VPN service.

“The [modem pool] perfor-
mance has not been as poor as
it was previously,” she said. “I
believe the reason is that many
people are using an ISP because
they want the higher speed ser-

RESARCI-I NOTES

Morning
people may
have the upper
hand at work,
school

Morning larks may have an
advantage in work or school
because their body clocks make
it easier for them to arrive at work
on time. Those beneﬁts may
carry over into the rest of their
lives, helping them to maintain
regular schedules and even get
better quality sleep, according
to Timothy H. Monk, profes-
sor of psychiatry at the School
of Medicine.

The Pitt research, published
in Chronobiology Interna-
tional, studied the sleep-wake
and activity patterns of healthy
adults to determine the relation-
ship between “morningness/

eveningness” and the rhythms
with which daily behaviors take
place.

Lifestyle regularity relates
to the fact that people differ
with respect to how regular or
irregular their daily schedules
are. Simple observation reveals
that some people have very regi-
mented lives with events taking
place at the same time each day,
while others have much more
irregular schedules.

“Whether the advantage
morning larks have over night
owls is based on real performance
or merely perception is a matter
of opinion,” Monk said. “There is
a perception that morning people
are more productive than night
people and end up getting more
praise from their supervisors,”
said Monk. “This is certainly true
for the early morning hours, but

by mid—day everyone is more or
less up to speed.”

Additionally, because night
owls may be slower out of the
gate, their breakfast and family
interactions can become hectic
and missed in the rush to get out
of the house.

Still, while morning larks may
have an advantage at the 9 a.m.
staff meeting, they may lose out
on evening work-related activi-
ties, said Monk.

“Morning larks, in general,
do not do as well when asked
to entertain a client over dinner
or to participate in late-evening
training, sales or bargaining
sessions. Also, they generally
do badly when asked to be shift
workers.”

This is one of several studies
being done by Monk on behalf

of the National Aeronautics and

Much of Monk’s NASA work
involves the impact of sleep
and circadian rhythms on per-
formance and safety. NASA
provided primary funding for
the study. Additional funding
was from the National Institute
on Aging and National Institute
of Mental Health.
Other authors include Daniel
J. Buysse, Jaime M. Potts,

Interaction
of synthetic,
biological
molecules
studied

A group of researchers,
including two Pitt professors,
have been awarded a $2 .8 million,
ﬁve—year grant by the National
Science Foundation’s collab-
orative research in chemistry
program to study chemical and
biological self-assembly.

The research could lead to
smaller, more ﬂexible comput-
ers and clothing that monitors
its wearer’s health.

Anna Balazs, the Robert Von
der Luft Professor of Chemical
and Petroleum Engineering in
Pitt’s School of Engineering,
and Gilbert Walker, an associ-
ate professor in the Department
of Chemistry, are working with
scientists from the University of
Massachusetts, NASA and IBM
Almaden to create unique new
materials by exploiting syn-
ergistic interactions that arise
when two distinct self—assembly
processes occur simultaneously

V.  one: system.’ Researchers .are '

Working with two components:
chaperonin proteins that self-
assemble into ﬁbers, bundles
or sheets, and synthetic block
copoly1ners that form lamellar,
cylindrical, spherical and more
complicated phases. By linking
one phase to — or embedding itin
— another, one self—organization
process can inﬂuence the other
and lead to novel assemblies.
“Understanding how syn-
thetic molecules interact with
biological molecules is essential
to biomaterials and biosensors,”
said Balazs. “Potential applica-
tions of this research include
antimicrobial coatings, respon-
sive materials, drug delivery and
biomolecular electronics.”

I\Iano-metals
don't deform
in same way
that ordinary
metals do

Mechanical engineering
professor Scott X. Mao and a
team of researchers identiﬁed
a way in which nanocrystalline
metals deform, conﬁrming that
“nanostructured” metals don’t
deform in the same way that
ordinary metals do.

The ﬁndings should help
nanoscientists — researchers
who use atoms and molecules as
basic building blocks to construct
minute machines, create new
materials or perform molecular
tasks —- to develop new metals
and metal coatings.

The results of the team’s
research were published in the
article, “Grain Boundary—Medi—
ated Plasticity in Nanocrystalline
Nickel,” which appeared in the
July 30 issue of the journal Sci-
ence.

“These ﬁndings expand our
knowledge of the nature of defor-
mation in metals and will change
the traditional way of thinking
about the deformation process,”
Mao said.

Other Pitt researchers
involved in the project were
Jorg M.K. Wiezorek, an asso-
ciate professor in the School of
Engineering’s Department of
Materials Science and Engineer-
ing, and Zhiwei Shan, a Ph.D.
student in Mao’s lab.

People under
hypnosis feel
pain similar

to. those with

geniiiiine pain

A brain imaging study by
researchers at Pitt and the Uni-
versity College of London (U CL)
exploring the experience of pain
in hypnotized volunteers has
provided new evidence for the
basis of “functional pain” such
as chronic low back pain, whose
underlying physical cause contin-
ues to baffle doctors.

In the study, to be published in
the journal Neurolmage, volun-
teers who Were hypnotized into
believing they felt pain showed
strikingly similar brain activity
to those subjected to genuine
pain via pulses of heat at 48.5
degrees Celsius (119 degrees

Fahrenheit).

Strengthening undergradu-
ate education and faculty teach-
ing innovation are key themes
in Arts and Sciences (A&S)
this academic year, according
to Regina Schulte—Ladbeck,
recently appointed associate dean
for Undergraduate Studies.

One new initiative in under-
grad education this term is the
learning communities pilot pro-
gram, which features six groups of
18 freshmen enrolled in thematic
blocks of courses.

For example, students in the
contemporary culture learning
community enroll together in
courses such as political science
and contemporary art. They also
enroll in customized freshman
studies and English composi-
tion courses with the theme of
contemporary culture. “There is
a hope this will enhance their con-
nection socially and academically,
so they feel comfortable work-
ing in groups and developing
new social connections,” said
Laura Dice, assistant dean for
freshmen in Arts and Sciences.
“The goal is to improve academic
performance and increase reten-
tion, graduation rates and student
satisfaction.”

A&S Undergraduate Studies
will evaluate the impact that such
learning communities have on
students’ ﬁrst year of college life.
Administrators want to increase
the number of learning commu-
nities and develop new themes for
next year’s entering class.

In other developments,
Schulte—Ladbeck and her staff
plan to streamline the approval
process for new courses. The
goals are to encourage faculty
to develop new courses and to
achieve better faculty satisfac-
U011.

Schulte—Ladbeck also is-col-
laborating with A&S faculty and

10

 

staff to develop a new certiﬁcate
in scientiﬁc leadership program.
The certiﬁcate will combine nat-
ural science courses with courses
enabling students to develop the
technical and behavioral skills
needed to become leaders of
their future research groups,
academic departments, business
or government ofﬁces.

A&S Dean N. John Cooper
commented, “I am looking for-
ward to an exciting new year,
with a wonderful group of new
students and some exceptional
new faculty members joining
our campus community.”

There are more than 650 fac-
ultyinArts and Sciences, which is
second only to the medical school
in number of faculty. A sampling
of new A&S faculty includes:

° Gordon Belot joined the
Universityin February as an asso-
ciate professor in the Department
of Philosophy and fellow in the
Center for Philosophy of Science

New York universities before
returning to Pitt, where he
earned a Ph.D. in philosophy.
He has held a postdoctoral
fellowship from the Social Sci-
ences and Humanities Research
Council and a fellowship from the
National Science Foundation.

Belot’s primary interests are
in philosophy of physics and phi-
losophy of science, and his recent
work has been concerned with the
interpretive, methodological and
metaphysical implications of
symmetry principles.

' Cecil Blake, former associ-
ate professor of communication
at the University of Nebraska,
joins Pitt as an associate pro-
fessor with tenure, beginning a
ﬁve-year term as communication
department chair.

sin, is a scholar of rhetoric and
communication with a focus on
African-American and African
rhetoric and communication as
central elements in the histori-
cal development of theories of
African, African diasporic and

The new two-year M.B.A.
program at Katz Graduate
School of Business has intro-
duced a “coaching program”
designed to gauge and improve
competencies, such as interper-
sonal or writing skills. Employers,
professors, project teammates
and others provide the basis for
competency ratings for second-
year M.B.A. students.

The school also contracted
with the theatre arts and commu-
nication departments, as well as
other academic programs, to help
round out the future M.B.A.s.
Students meet either one-on—one
with faculty from other academic
programs or in special seminars.
“We’re making use of the entire
campus,” said Dean Frederick
Winter. He expects students to
reduce class schedules this fall
to accommodate time needed
for coaching.

M.B.A. candidates can expect
a “position coach” as well. Posi-
tion coaches, such as retired
executives and other seasoned

dents with expertise from their
respective specialties.

Also new for second—year
M.B.A. students, the school
has developed two non-credit
courses, Dealing With Ambigu-
ity and Business in the News.

The Katz school will extend
its reach internationally in 2005
by adding Manchester, U.K., as a
fourth location offering the inter-
national executive M.B.A. Cur-
rent locations for the program
include Pittsburgh, Prague and
Sao Paulo.

The school welcomed two
new full-time faculty this fall.

Mei Feng, assistant profes-
sor of business administration,
will receive her doctorate in
accounting from the University
of Michigan Business School
in the near future. She holds
a Master of Arts in accounting
from Renmin University and a
Bachelor of Arts in accounting
from Nankai University, both
located in the People’s Republic
of China.

Her interests include ﬁnan-
cial accounting and reporting,
voluntary disclosure, the role of
ﬁnancial analysts, ﬁnancial state-
ment analysis and management
compensation.

Tansev Geylani, assistant
professor of business adminis-
tration, completed his Ph.D. in
marketing at Carnegie Mellon.
He holds an M.S.I.A. from
CMU and an M.B.A. from Koc
University in Istanbul, both in
marketing, as well as a B.S. in
mechanical engineering from
the Middle East Technical Unit
in Ankara, Turkey. His research
interests include game theoretical
modeling, industrial organization

and marketing channels.

The College of Business
Administration joined with Pitt’s
School of Engineering for a new

VVhat’s new in the School of
Education includes a grant, a
master’s program with an inter-
national ﬂavor, expanded and
new laboratory facilities and
faculty hires.

The school recently received a
$236,3 00 grant from The Grable
Foundation to develop an elec-
tronic portfolio system support-
ing the preparation of teachers
and school leaders. This system
will permit students to learn to be
stronger educators by observing
and reﬂecting upon their teaching
or school leadership activities.

Over the summer, Dean
Alan Lesgold signed an agree-
ment with the University of the
Humanities (UH), Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia, under which Pitt will
offer a master’s degree in higher
education management on
the UH campus. A number of
courses will be taught in Ulaan-
baatar during summers by Pitt
faculty, and additional courses
will be offered during the aca-
demic year by recent graduates
of Pitt’s doctoral program who
now work in Mongolia.

“Mongolia, now coming free
of the Communist era, is also
seeing an expansion of universi-
ties and a huge pent-up desire for
further education,” Lesgold said.

VV1th the stafﬁng we can provide
and the training we offer, we are
conﬁdent that they too will be
extremely successful.”

The Center for Physical

for Macs and one for PCs, holds
20 computers, a podium, projec-
tor, smart board and printer. The
Macintosh lab computer operat-
ing system also has been upgraded
to Mac OS 10.3.

Three faculty have joined the
school sincejanuary, Consuella

Her interests focus on public
policy and higher education
access and retention, faculty
tenure and socialization, diversity
in higher education, leadership
and political economy of edu-
cation, and international and
comparative education.

Lewis received her B.A in
political science and an M.S.
in counseling and development
from Indiana University, Bloom-
ington, a certiﬁcate in manage-
ment development from Harvard
and a Ph.D. in higher education
from Claremont Graduate Uni-
versity.

Assistant professor Myers,
previously a project research
assistant at the University of
Toronto, joins the program in
social studies education in the
Department of Instruction and
Learning.

Fluent in Italian and Portu-
guese and with a basic knowl-
edge of Spanish, Myers spent
ﬁve months in Brazil investigat-
ing educational activism and
teaching for social change. He
also was part of a workshop for
UIVIICEF on global education in
Kyrgyzstan.

He received a B.A. in urban
history from Haverford College,
an M.A. in educational thought
and sociocultural studies from the
University of New Mexico and
is near completion of a Ph.D. in
comparative, international and
development education from
the University of Toronto.

Shivers, assistant professor in
psychology in education, recently
completed her Ph.D. in psycho-
logical studies in education at
UCLA.

Her research specialties
include child care policy, social
and emotional development of
low-income children of color,
effective early education in low-
income communities of color,
child care workforce issues, and
provider—child relationships in

with the Center for Race and
Social Problems in the School
of Social Work.

She received her B.A. in
English literature from Arizona

_. State University,_and.a_LD._,from

" Howard University.

“Over the next few years,
the School of Education will
be changing a lot, as we replace
those who recently retired,” said
Dean Lesgold. “Our goal is to
become even stronger in service,

teaching and research that aims
directly at improving education
for lifetime success and health
— both regionally and around
the world.”

nrigirie-ering
A new graduate computer
engineering program offering
both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
kicks off this fall semester. The
program is housed jointly in

30, 2005, to return to the full-
time law faculty. (See May 13,
Universigy Times.) _  

“‘As’I1ooktovv’ard bﬁrupcoiﬁl
ing year, I see three important
challenges,” Herring said. “One
is our dean’s search. Our school’s
reputation is ﬁrmly established,
and we have a great opportunity
to hire a real leader in legal edu-
cation.”

A second challenge, he said,
is building on the success of the
school’s student scholarship pro-
gram, which has contributed to
rising student qualiﬁcations.

“Third, I’m particularly
excited about our new clinical
programs, especially the estab-
lishment of the Community
Economic Development Clinic,
which takes us into transactional
law, a new area for our school.
The clinic will work with entre-
preneurs, nonproﬁts and com-
munity groups, particularly in
poor neighborhoods.”

The dental school continues
to expand its Multidisciplinary
Implant Center. For people with
tooth loss, an implanted replace-
ment tooth stimulates the bone,
ultimately maintaining the bone
and soft tissue and giving a more
natural look and feel.

Last year, the center’s inaugu-
ral year, 2,481 procedures were
performed and 2 78 implants were
placed, according to school ofﬁ—
cials. “As one of the most aged
populations in the country, there
is a particularly extensive need for
these services,” said Thomas W.
Braun, professor and dean. “The
volume of patients continues to
grow and we are doing everything
in our power to keep up with the
demand. Additionally, this is one
of the rare centers in the coun-
try that functions across each
specialty to educate the dental
student in management of all
aspects of implant placement,”
Braun explained.

This year, the implant center
plans to increase the ﬁrst-profes-
sional experience to 2 5 percent of
the class and clinical activityin the
center by 2 5 percent. The center
also plans to offer a three-part
implant continuing education
course.

Pharmacy

The school celebrated its
125th anniversary last year
capped by a gala in June that
raised more than $30,000 for
scholarships.

Effective May 1, Patricia D.
Kroboth was appointed dean of
the School of Pharmacy, having
served two years as interim dean.
(See April 29 University Times.)

The school joined other
schools of pharmacy this year in
implementing a shared on—line
application process, Pharm-
CAS. The result was an increase

 

in Pharm.D. program applicants
to 1,200 for the approximately
100 places in the ﬁrst-year pro-
fessional program.

Another new initiative is

tal health by creating a central
information resource, working
with partner organizations to
improve the availability of data
and increasing public aware-

ness. The center was made pos-
sible through funding from the
Heinz Endowments.

An important component of
the center is its adoption of a
community-derived deﬁnition
of environmental health to guide
its activities, which will include
socioeconomic as well as lifestyle
and behavioral factors that have
an inﬂuence on health.

The Health Policy Institute

(HPI), part of the Department of
Health Policy and Management,

Pitt—Bradford will dedicate
Blaisdell Hall, the campus’s
fine arts and communication
arts building, during the annual
alumni and familyweekend, Oct.
1 and 2.

As part of the festivities, Pitt
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
will present an honorary degree
to internationally known opera
star and Bradford native Marilyn
Home. Home served as honorary
chair of the Blaisdell Fine Arts
Challenge, which raised $3 .4 mil-
lion toward the new building.

The second phase of the
building’s construction, which
includes the 500-seat Bromeley
Family Theater and an art gallery,
was completed in April.

The building’s new art gallery,
with nearly 1,000 square feet of
exhibition space, will showcase
the work of students and invited
artists. This year the gallery
will feature the work of Bovey
Lee, a faculty member in Pitt’s
studio arts department, as well
as selected compositions from
Pitt—Bradford students.

A new residence hall, to be
completed next summer, will
help to accommodate the high-
est number of resident students
in Pitt-Bradford’s 41-year his-
tory, currently 5 85. The three-
story residence hall will feature
22 four-person suites and three
ﬁve—person suites. The corner-
stone of the building will be laid

Sept. 8.

The summer has seen a
number of construction proj-
ects, including reconfiguring
the road around campus (“The
Loop”), installing new lighting,
drainage and landscaping along
the road, and installing monu-
ment signage at the campus’s
second entrance.

Construction is under way
on a three—story, 96—bed, apart-
ment—style dormitory. The $4.2
million project is scheduled to be
completed next July.

The building will house
members of the Natural Sciences

and New Technologies Village,
one of four academic villages at
UPG that integrate curricular
and extracurricular experiences
of students.

Currently, natural sciences
and new technologies students
are housed at other dormitories
on campus, and the village’s
programming takes place in the
Lyceum.

A hallmark of the Natural
Sciences and New Technologies
Village, according to director
Kerry Holzworth, is the hands-on
approach to learning new tech-
nologies. Students are exposed
to digital movie—making, web-
page design, three-dimensional
environmental modeling and
animation design.

The number of resident stu-
dents at the start of the 2004 fall

term is expected to be about 5 80.

To accommodate the additional

96 students from the new dorm,

the Chambers Hall dining area is

being expanded. The completion

of this $3 .8 million addition also

is scheduled for next July.

In an artistic addition to

the Greensburg campus, UPG

alumnus Terry Bengel created

Upward to the Light, the stained

glass mural that now adorns the

tower of Nlillstein Library.

The work is inspired by the
Allegory of the Cave from Plato’s
“Republic,” with its central idea
of ascension and enlighten-
ment.

Pitt-Greensburg also hired;

two full—time faculty members,
Elisa E. Beshero-Bondar and

RESEARCH NOTES

This suggests that some forms
of pain that cannot be traced to
a physical problem may have a
neurological basis.

The study found that a third
group of volunteers asked to
imagine that they were experi-
encing the same pain had sig-
niﬁcantly lower brain activity
than the hypnotized and genuine
pain groups.

Stuart Derbyshire, Pitt assis-
tant professor of anesthesiology
and radiology, was principal
investigator, along with David
Oakley, director of UCL’s hyp-
nosis unit.

“The study provides direct
evidence of the brain generat-
ing pain in the absence of any
actual noxious input,” Derbyshire
said. “That is signiﬁcant because
many functional disorders, such
as ﬁbromyalgia, might rely upon
similar mechanisms. We are cur-
rently running studies to test that
idea with patients.

“Functional pain disorders
such as chronic back pain, facial
pain and ﬁbromyalgia have no
known underlying medical cause.
Conversion disorders such as hys-
terical paralysis, where someone
with a normal, healthy leg might
be unable to move it, are just as
poorly understood.”

Patients with
most severe
COPD more
likely to harbor
Pneumocystis
organism in
their lungs

VVhile smoking may be the
most common cause of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), severity of COPD

could be inﬂuenced by a common

organism that can colonize in the
lungs without causing outward
symptoms, suggest results of a
study published in the Aug. 15
issue of the American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical
Care Medicine, a journal of the
American Thoracic Society.

The organism, Pneumocys—
tis jiroveci (previously known as
Pneumocystis carinii), seldom
causes serious problems for
normal hosts, but in people with
suppressed immune systems, such
as transplant patients or cancer
patients undergoing chemo-
therapy, it can result in a deadly
lung infection. For patients
with HIV, Pneumocystis is the
most common and most serious
AIDS—defining opportunistic
infection.

The study, conducted at Pitt’s
School of Medicine, involved
68 patients with COPD and 44
patients with other lung diseases,
such as cystic ﬁbrosis.

Pneumocystis was more
prevalent in the COPD patients,
especially those with the most
advanced disease. Smoking
history, number of packs of
cigarettes smoked over time, age
and gender did not correlate with
the existence of the organism in
the lungs.

“Pneumocystis colonization
is associated with severity of
COPD, and airway obstruction
was signiﬁcantly worse in patients
whose lungs were colonized than
in those patients who had no evi-
dence of the organism. Moreover,
colonization did not appear to be
the result of other clinical fac-
tors or concomitant conditions,”
stated Alison Morris, assistant
professor of medicine in the Divi-
sion of Pulmonary and Critical

Care Medicine at the University

of Southern California. Morris
conducted the study while com-
pleting a fellowship at Pitt under
Karen A. Norris, the paper’s
senior author, and an associate
professor ofimmunology atPitt’s
School of Medicine.

“Further work will be neces-
sary to clarify whether the pres-
ence of Pneumocystis contributes
to worsening lung function or
whether patients with the poor-
est lung function are predisposed
to Pneumocystis. However the
correlation between the two
cannot be ignored,” said Frank
C. Sciurba, associate professor
of medicine in the Division of
Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical
Care Medicine at Pitt’s School
of Medicine.

In addition to Morris, Norris
and Sciurba, other authors from
Pitt include Irina P. Lebedeva,
Department of Immunology, and
Andrew Githaiga, Department
of Medicine.

The study was supported by
the National Institutes of Health
and the Canadian Institute for
Health Research.

“Construction projects
always disturb the landscape,”
said Rafael G. Quimpo, the
project’s principal investigator
and professor of civil and envi-
ronmental engineering in the
School of Engineering.

“In many ways the aesthetics
in highway alignment and design
can emphasize the harmony
between manmade structures
and nature, and a general rule
is that, in order to preserve the
ecology, a project must have mini-
mal impact on ﬂora and fauna in

Stretched
material could
lead to next
generation of
high-speed
electronic
devices

A team of researchers led by
scientists from Pitt and Penn
State University has created a

new material that promises to .

out—perform all other known
materials for use in high-fre-
quency devices.

“The technological impli-
cations are staggering,” said
Jeremy Levy, an associate
professor in Pitt’s Department
of Physics and Astronomy who
investigated the properties of
the new material, a novel form
of strontium titanate.

He and his fellow research-
ers transformed the normal
properties of strontium titanate
(a synthesized, crystalline mate-
rial made up of the metals stron-
tium and titanium, plus oxygen)
by stretching it, atom—by—atom,
according to a report published
Aug. 12 in the journal Nature.

The result is a form of stron-
tium titanate that is “ferroelec—
tric” — i.e., it has a natural,
spontaneous electric polariza-
tion that can be reversed by the
application of an electric ﬁeld
—— at room temperature.

The new material could have
a variety of commercial applica-
tions and might even lead to the
next generation of high—speed
electronic devices, researchers
believe.

Applications for the new
material could range from use
in cell phones capable of oper-
ating at lower power than current
models to high-density, nonvola-
tile storage media for computers,
Levy said.

Creating the stretched stron-
tium titanate is akin to stretching
a bed sheet beyond its normal
limits, explained Darrell Schlom,
professor of materials science
and engineering at Penn State,
where the stretched material was
synthesized.

In this case, the “bed sheet”

is strontium titanate and the
“bed” is a newly synthesized
crystalline material, dysprosium
scandate. “VVhat we are doing is
stitching, atom by atom, the ‘bed
sheet’ of strontium titanate to the
‘bed’ of dysprosium scandate,”
Schlom said.

“In doing so, we can prevent
the strontium titanate from
wrinkling or tearing, and we can
transform the properties of this
sheet of material in ways that are
impossible to do otherwise.”

The research was supported
by a $750,000, three—year grant
from the National Science Foun-
dation.

Condom use
decreases PID
recurrence

Women wishing to decrease
their risk for a common and seri-
ous infection of the upper genital
tract called pelvic inﬂammatory
disease (PID) should make sure
their sexual partners use con-
doms and use them consistently,
according to a multi—center study
from the Graduate School of
Health (GSPH).

Appearing in the August issue
of the Americanjournal of Public
Health, the report is the ﬁrst pro-
spective study to clearly show
an association between regular
condom use and a reduced risk
not only for recurrent PID, but
also for related complications
such as chronic pelvic pain and
infertility, said Roberta Ness,
professor and chair of the Depart-
ment of Epidemiology at GSPH
and the study’s ﬁrst author.

Consistent condom users
were half as likely to have an

episode of recurrent‘ PID as ‘

those Women whose partners
never used condoms, the study
found.

Significantly, women who
reported regular use of con-
doms were 60 percent less likely
to become infertile. The rate of
reported condom use appeared to
have no effect on future chronic
pelvic pain.

“Bacteria that cause cervical
infection can travel into the
upper genital tract and trigger
PID,” said Ness, who also directs
the women’s health program at
GSPH and is professor of medi-
cine and obstetrics, gynecology
and reproductive sciences at the
School of Medicine.

“Many different organisms
can cause the disorder, but most
cases of PID are associated with
sexually transmitted diseases
(STDS) such as gonorrhea or
chlamydia.”

While the study speaks
speciﬁcally to a decreased risk
of disease recurrence among a
population of women who have
already had at least one apparent
episode of PID, the results may
indicate a similar reduced risk for
PID acquisition in the general
population, Ness noted, adding
that more study is needed.

Other Pitt authors include
Richard Sweet, also of Magee-
Womens Hospital, Debra Bass
and Kevin Kip.

The Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality and from
the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases at NIH
funded the study.

Fluid derived
from aloe plant
prolongs life
after
hemorrhagic
shock

A novel resuscitation ﬂuid
derived from aloe Vera that was
developed by researchers at Pitt’s
McGowan Institute for Regen-
erative Medicine has the potential
to save the lives of patients with
massive blood loss, according to
results of an animal study pub—
lished in the August edition of
the medical journal Shock.

The ﬁndings could have a
signiﬁcant impact on the treat-
ment of hemorrhagic shock

caused by both civilian and '

military trauma.

In a rodent model of hemor-
rhagic shock, animals that were
given a very small amount of
the ﬂuid, an aloe Vera-derived
drag reducing polymer (DRP),
had signiﬁcantly longer survival
time and increased systemic
whole body oxygen consumption,
even in the absence of resuscita-
tion with blood or other ﬂuids,
compared to animals that did not
receive DRP.

“We hope this ﬂuid will offer
a viable solution to a signiﬁcant
problem, both on and off the
battleﬁeld,” said,_.sen1'0r author
Mitchell -P. Fink, professor
and chair, Department of Criti-
cal Care Medicine and Watson
Professor of Surgery at Pitt’s
School of Medicine.

“Typically, hemorrhagic
shock is treated by controlling
ongoing bleeding and restor-

ing blood volume by infusing are‘

lactate solution and packed red
blood cells.

“Soldiers wounded in combat
often lose signiﬁcant amounts of
blood, and there is no practical
way to replace the necessary
amount of blood fast enough on
the front lines. VVhen this hap-
pens, there is inadequate perfu-
sion of the organs, which quickly
leads to a cascade of life-threaten-
ing events,” Fink said.

“Medics would need only
to carry a small amount of this
solution, which could feasibly be
administered before the soldier
is evacuated to a medical unit or
facility.”

In the current study, led by
Carlos A. Macias, a visiting
research associate in critical
care medicine in the School of
Medicine, ﬁve of 10 rats that were
injected with a small amount of
a normal saline solution survived
four hours after hemorrhagic
shock.

Of the animals treated with
the same amount of saline and
the aloe-derived DRP, eight of
10 survived.

The animals treated with
DRP also fared better in another
experimentinvolvingmoresevere
blood loss; ﬁve of 15 survived the
two-hour observation period,
compared to one of 14 treated
with saline solution alone.

Seven animals receiving no
treatment all died within 35
minutes.

In addition to Fink and
Macias, authors of the study are
Marina Kameneva, research
associate professor of surgery
and bioengineering; Jyrki J.
Tenhunen, visiting research

associate in the Department of
Critical Care Medicine at Pitt’s
School of Medicine, and Juan-
Carlos Puyana, associate profes-
sor of critical care medicine and
surgery at Pitt and critical care
director of the trauma/surgery
intensive care units at Pitt’s
medical center.

The research was supported
by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

ACL injury
prevention
project gets
funding

U.S. Senator Rick Santo-
rum, R-Pa., presented a check
for $100,000 Aug. 24 to sports
injury researchers at the Uni-
versity and UPMC’s Center for
Sports Medicine. The money
will support continued research
examining risk factors and pre-
vention strategies for anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries
in female athletes.

Accepting the check was
principal investigator Scott M.
Lephart of Pitt’s Neuromuscular
Research Laboratory (NMRL),
located within the UPMC Center
for Sports Medicine on the South
Side.

Santorumsecured the funds
through the Labor, Health and
Human Services and Education
Omnibus Bill as part of the FY-
2004 appropriations bill passed
earlier in the year.

“This important and gener-
ous award serves female athletes
at a critical time as we continue
our ongoing Female ACL Injury
Prevention Project agenda, initi-
ated in 1995, aimed at examining
the epidemic of ACL injuries in
female athletes and exploring
methods to prevent the injury,”
said Lephart, who is director of
the NMRL. ,

Lephart also is an associate
professor and chairman of the
sports medicine and nutrition
department at Pitt’s School
of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences and associate profes-
sor in the orthopaedic surgery
department at the School of
Medicine.

“This research has signiﬁcant
women’s health care implications
as studies have shown that female
athletes are up to eight times
more likely to injure an ACL
than their male counterparts,”
he added.

The ACL is the main stabiliz-
ing ligament in the knee joint,
connecting the femur to the
tibia. ACL injuries are common
in fast-moving sports that involve
sudden starting, stopping, tum-
ing, jumping and landing, such
as in basketball, soccer and
lacrosse.

“ACL injury to a young
female is far more devastating
than simply missing a high school
sports season,” said Freddie Fu,
professor and chairman of the
orthopaedic surgery department
at the School of Medicine.

“This injury often requires
surgical repair and lengthy reha-
bilitation and begins a pattern
of premature arthritic changes
that can signiﬁcantly reduce the

physical activity of women as they
age, thus affecting their ability
to have physically ﬁt lifestyles,”
F u added.

CORE, UPIVIC
announce trial
for additional
renal call
center

The Center for Organ Recov-
ery and Education (CORE), the
region’s designated organ pro-
curement organization (OPO)
and oversight authority on organ
allocation announced that it will
partner with the transplant center
at UPMC on a 90-day trial for
the hospital to operate its own
extra-renal call center.

This pilot project is intended
to assess the potential beneﬁts of
an on—site call center managed
by UPMC for the purpose of
expediting the placement of
available organs imported from
outside the tri—state region with
qualified recipients awaiting
transplantation at UPMC.

During the 90-day period,
which began Sept. 1, CORE and
UPMC will concurrently moni-
tor organ matches to UPMC
patients through the University’s

extra—renal call center. Under
this trial, CORE will continue
to ensure the allocation of avail-
able organs to a descending match
list, thus protecting the integrity
of the donation process.

“CORE agrees this trial with
UPMC is intended to save pre-
cious time in the matching pro-
cess and will ultimately be helpful
to the patient candidate due to
the large numbers of transplants
performed at UPMC,” said Susan
Stuart, CORE’s president and
chief executive ofﬁcer. “Under
the trial process, UPMC and an
OPO from outside the region will
have direct contact. CORE will,
however, retain its oversight of
the organ allocation process to
ensure equitable distribution of
organs to the best matches,” she
added.

CORE remains the primary
call center and intermediary of
the organ retrieval and allocation
process with its own call center
serving 160 hospitals and nearly
6 million people in western and
central Pennsylvania, the state
of West Virginia and upstate
New York.

Since its inception, CORE

has helped to provide more
than 300,000 organs, tissue and
corneas for transplantation.

Fund set up to
support brain
tumor research

Pittsburgh—based railroad
equipment supply company
Wabtec Corp. has set up a memo-
rial fund to support brain tumor
research and physician education
at the University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute (UPCI). The
fund, created in memory of
former Wabtec president and
CEO Gregory T.H. Davies, will
help promote scientiﬁc and clini-
cal research on innovative strate-
gies to prevent, detect, diagnose
and treat brain tumors, diagnosed
in approximately 20,000 Ameri-
cans each year.

“A brain tumor diagnosis can
be devastating for a patient,” said
Ronald Herberman, director of
UPCI and the UPMC Cancer
Centers. “Not only do they inﬁl-
trate critical tissue quickly, they
also tend to resist a multitude of
treatments. We are extremely

grateful to Wabtec for the for-
mation of this fund because it will
allow us to pursue promising, new
approaches to brain tumors that
can translate into vast improve-
ments in treatment and possibly
even cures.”

The Gregory T.H. Davies

Fund will support the UPCI
brain tumor program’s ongoing
efforts in neuro-oncology, neu-
rology, neurosurgery, neuropa-
thology, neuro—imaging, radia-
tion oncology and translational
research with the ultimate goal
of reducing death and disability
from brain tumors.

Wabtec and its directors con-
tributed $300,000 to the fund,
established to honor Davies, a
graduate of Harvard Business
School, who also worked at Dana-
her Corp. and Cummins Engine
Co. Davies was diagnosed with a
malignant brain tumor in March
of this year and died inJuly at the
age of 57.

“Greg’s courage and strength
were an inspiration to everyone
at Wabtec, and his legacy will live

challenges.”

Ninety percent of all primary
brain tumors occur in adults 40-
70 years of age.

$10 million
grant awarded
‘C0 UPCI

The University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute (UPCI) has
received a five-year, $10 million
Specialized Program of Research
Excellence (SPORE) federal
grant to examine innovative
treatment strategies designed
to improve survival outcomes
for patients with head and neck
cancer. The grant, awarded by the
National Cancer Institute (N CI),
is the second SPORE awarded to
UPCI —- the first was awarded to
the cancer institute’s lung cancer
program in 2001 — and is one
of only four SPORE grants in
head and neck cancer awarded
nationally.

“Head and neck cancer is one
of the most physically and emo-
tionally debilitating cancers,”
said Jennifer Grandis, princi-
pal investigator of the grant and
professor of otolaryngology and
pharmacology in the School of
Medicine, and director of UPCl’s
head and neck cancer program.

20

“Treatment options are limited
and often leave a patient with dis-
abling side effects that can have
a devastating impact on quality
of life. This grant will enable us
to enhance the quality of life for
head and neck cancer patients and
greatly improve their prognoses
through the collaborative efforts
of our researchers in the labora-
tory and clinic.”

The grant funds four major
translational research projects
that focus on genetic changes
that are potential risk factors for
head and neck cancer, intracel-
lular signaling proteins activated
during head and neck cancer,
and new treatment strategies
designed to reduce the morbid-
ity and mortality from head and
neck cancer.

In the first major project in the
grant, Marjorie Romkes, associ-
ate professor, Center for Clinical
Pharmacology, Department of
Medicine, and Joel Weissfeld,
associate professor, Department
of Epidemiology, will examine
the correlation between prom-
ising genetic markers for head
and neck cancer and tobacco
and alcohol use.

“Eighty percent of head and
neck cancer patients are smokers,
chew tobacco and consume large
amounts of alcohol,” Romkes
said. “If we can determine who
among this population will most
likely develop cancer, we can
screen and treat them earlier.”

In another project, Grandis
and Daniel Johnson, associ-
ate professor of medicine, will
examine intracellular signaling
proteins called signal transducer
and activators of transcription
(STATS) that have been linked
to tumor progression in several
cancers, including head and neck
cancer. Albert DeLeo, professor
of pathology, and Robert Ferris,
assistant professor of otolaryn-
gology, will head up an additional
project to develop a therapeutic
vaccine that targets the tumor-
suppressing gene p5 3.

In a ﬁnal project, Jill Sieg-
fried, professor of pharmacol-
ogy, and Grandis will examine
multiple signaling pathways
implicated in the proliferation
of head and neck cancer.

With 36,200 estimated new
cases and 11,000 deaths in 2003,
head and neck cancer accounts
for 4-5 percent of all newly
diagnosed cancers in the United
States. More than two—thirds of
head and neck cancer patients
are at a locally advanced stage
when diagnosed and have a poor
ﬁve-year survival rate even after
treatment.

Genetic
contributor to
cleft lip, palate
identified -

A Pitt researcher was among
those, led by a team at the
University of Iowa, to identify
a genetic variation that sig-
niﬁcantly increases the risk of a
baby being born with cleft lip and
palate, one of the most common
birth defects in the world.

The finding helps explain
10-15 percent of all cases of the
common form of cleft lip and
palate and points scientists in new
directions for improved predic-
tion, prevention and treatment
of the condition. Study results
appeared in the Aug. 19 issue
of the New England Journal of
Medicine.Amajor contributorto
the paper was Mary Marazita of
the Center for Craniofacial and
Dental Genetics in Pitt’s School
of Dental Medicine.

Grant funds
research on
ovarian
function

The National Institutes of
Health (NIH) has awarded a
grant of nearly$ 1 .4 million to Pitt
and Magee—Womens Research
Institute (MWRI) for research
aimed at the basic understanding
of ovarian follicles — one of the
basic building blocks of life.

The ﬁve-year grant, through
the NIH’s National Institute
of Child Health and Human
Development, marks the larg-
est received thus far by project
principal investigator Elizabeth
McGee, assistant professor of
obstetrics, gynecology and repro-
ductive sciences at the School of
Medicine.

“The follicle is the ‘essential
ingredient’ of the ovary, pro-
viding both egg cells and the
hormones necessary for female
physical development and repro-
duction,” said McGee, who also
is an assistant investigator at
MWRI. “Depending on timing,
follicular dysfunction can cause
infertility and premature meno-
pause or derail puberty and result
in severe osteoporosis.”

In the United States, about
9 million women used infertility
services in 1995 , according to the
Centers for Disease Control, and
indications are that the problem
is increasing. VVhile infertility
is age-related, there are other
factors that are far less well
known.

“Modern infertility treatment
concentrates on the last two weeks
of follicular development, but it

actually takes six to 15 months for
follicles to mature to ovulation,”
said McGee. “That’s analogous to
getting prenatal care only in the
last two weeks of pregnancy.”

Very little is known about
how ovarian follicles grow in
their early stages. Research
into the genetic interactions of
this prolonged early period of
development could have signiﬁ-
cant impact on future infertility
treatment, she said.

Other Pitt researchers work-
ing with McGee include Jill
Brekoski, associate investigator,
MWRI, and Anthony Zeleznik,
professor of cell biology and

physiology.

Study looks at
how gender
affects living
with traumatic
spinal cord
injuries

Although men and women
who have suffered traumatic
spinal cord injuries (SCIS)
report comparable levels of
psychological well being, recent
studies have found that older
female SCI survivors experience
aging differently from their male
counterparts. For example, older
women with SCI have higher
incidences of pain, depression
and suicide than men, and are
less likely to hold a job and have
access to preventive health care.
In a new study, researchers at
the University Center for Social
and Urban Research (U CSUR)
hope to shed light on these dis-
crepancies.

The UCSUR study is sup-
ported by a $2 . 1 million, ﬁve-year

grant from the National Institute J

of Nursing Research.

Headed by UCSUR director
Richard Schulz, professor of
psychiatry, the study is designed
to provide information, resources
and support to older individuals
with SCI and their caregivers.
UCSUR’s study is one of the ﬁrst
aimed at providing a structured
intervention for the growing
number of caregivers of older
SCI survivors.

Over the next two years,
researchers at Pitt and the
University of Miami will collect
data on participants’ physical
and mental health status, as well
as levels of physical, emotional
and practical support available.
These factors will be examined
relative to participants’ gender,
age, health, degree of function-
ing, access to health care services
and social network integrity.

Biochemical
sensing
systems as
small as
fingernail tip?
The National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) recently awarded
Pitt a $1.3 million, four-year
NSF Nanoscale Interdisciplinary
Research Team (NIRT) grant to
develop plasmonic chip technolo-
gies for biochemical sensing.
Plasmonic chip technology
— which may someday enable
scientists to squeeze millions
of sensor elements onto a single
computer chip — promises to
create nanoscaled biochemi-
cal sensing systems, says lead
researcher Hong Koo Kim, a
professor of electrical and com-
puter engineering and co-direc-
tor of Pitt’s Institute of NanoSci-

ence and Engineering.

Kim and his colleagues also
will investigate the fundamen-
tals of plasmonic phenomena in
nanoscale metallic structures.

“If this nanoscaled biochemi-
cal sensing technology becomes
a reality, it would revolutionize
health care —- including diag-
nosis of disease and monitoring
of health status —— as well as our
ability to detect toxic and haz-
ardous biochemical agents for
environmental and homeland
security purposes,” said Kim.

Kim’s project involves cross-
school collaboration with Hrvoje
Petek of the Department of
Physics and Astronomy, and Rob
Coalson, David Waldeck and
Gilbert Walker of the Depart-
ment of Chemistry.

Placing relative
with dementia
in long-term
care facili

does little to
ease caregivers
emotional
burden

Results of a multi-site study
coordinated by Pitt in this week’s
Journal of the American Medical
Association OANIA) show care-
givers who place their relatives
into institutionalized care get no
relief from depression and anxi-
ety. In fact, they suffer additional
emotional trauma following their
decision.

This is the ﬁrst study to pro-
vide a comprehensive analysis of
the emotional turmoil caregivers
experience during the transition
of their loved one from home to
a long-term care facility.

Results from the four-year D

study of 1,222 "caregiver-patient
pairs found that for the 180
caregivers who had to turn
over care of their loved one

to an institution, symptoms of ‘ I

depression and anxiety stayed as
high as they were when they were
in-home caregivers. These ﬁnd-
ings stand in contrast to earlier
ﬁndings by lead author Richard
Schulz, professor of psychiatry
and director of Pitt’s Center for
Social and Urban Research, and
his group showing that death of a
loved one after caregiving results
in improvements in depression.

Schulz said: “They continue
to feel distressed because of the
suffering and decline of their
loved one as well as having to
face new challenges such as
frequent trips to the long-term
care facility, reduced control
over the care provided to their
relative and taking on responsi-
bilities such as coordinating and
monitoring care.”

In addition, cognitive and
functional declines are common
in patients who go into long-
term care, and caregivers often
blame themselves for this decline,
according to Schulz.

The patients in this studywere
all diagnosed with moderate to
severe Alzheimer’s disease and
had a median age of 80 years.

Additional authors from
Pitt include Steven H. Belle,
Kathleen McGinnis and Song
Zhang. Researchers from the
University of Miami and the
University of Alabama at Bir-
mingham also contributed.

The study was funded by
the National Institute on Aging
and the National Institute for
Nursing Research. I

PEOPLE OF THE TIIVIES  

Claudia Roth has been
appointed president of Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
(WPIC) and vice president of
behavioral health at UPMC.
Roth has been serving in this
role on an interim basis since
January.

Roth has been with VVPIC for
nearly 18 years. She has a Ph.D.

and has served in several WPIC
senior administrative positions
over the past decade.

Patricia Sweeney, visiting
assistant professor at the Center
for Public Health Practice
(CPHP) in the Graduate School
of Public Health (GSPH), was
recently awarded the nationally
competitive 2004 Pﬁzer Faculty
Scholar Award in Public Health
for her project “Public Health
Workforce Recruitment, Reten-
tion and Promotion in the Civil
Service System.”

The Pﬁzer Faculty Scholar
Awards in Public Health, part of
the Pﬁzer Medical & Academic
Partnerships Awards, are career
development awards intended
to support the development
and career track of junior fac-

ulty in public health interested

in pursuing community-based, __ _

These awa;-g1s-als'6"’are intended
to fofstei-'I“E§ollaborative partner-
 between accredited schools
of public health and state and local
departments of public health.

With the $13 0,000 award for a
two—year national study, Sweeney
will identify the procedures and
criteria utilized for publichealth
hiring and promotion within the
respective civil service systems
of the 50 states, analyze the laws
governing those systems and
determine the extent to which
these systems are supporting
public health competency—based
hiring and promotion. The study
is expected to result in a model
for competency—based assess-
ment of personnel that can be
incorporated into public health
personnel systems.

Sweeney, who holds an

‘appointment in the Department

of Health Policy and Manage-
ment at GSPH, worked as a
home—care and public health
nurse for 24 years before receiv-
ing her M.P.H. degree from
GSPH.

A 2003 graduate of Pitt’s
School of Law, Sweeney is a past
recipient of the Faculty Scholar
Award for Excellence in Legal
Scholarship for her research
on childhood lead exposure.
Her work includes serving as
program manager for several
Department of Justice-funded
studies in the areas of commu-
nity health planning, adolescent
problem behaviors and chronic,
violent juvenile offenders.

Sweeney’sresearchisendorsed
by the Association of State and
Territorial Health Ofﬁcials and
the National Association of State
Personnel Executives.

“Currently, state health agen-
cies are facing ﬁnancial cuts as
well as retirements of experienced
personnel on a massive scale,” says
Margaret A. Potter, director of
CPHP and Sweeney’s mentor on
this project. “Sweeney’s proposed
research will contribute critically
important information to help

these agencies to maintain and
to build their worlcforces with
highly qualiﬁed personnel.”

Also at GSPH, Charles
R. Rinaldo Jr., chairman and
professor of the Department of
Infectious Diseases and Micro-
biology, has been recognized
by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) for his superior
competence and outstanding
productivity through the grant
of a MERIT (Method to Extend
Research in Time) Award for his
research.

MERIT awards provide
long-term support to investiga-
tors with records of scientiﬁc
achievement in research areas
of special importance or promise
who have demonstrated a long-
term commitment to and success
in research. Less than 5 percent
of NIH-funded investigators
are selected to receive MERIT
awards.

The award was given for
Rinaldo’s NIH-ftmded research
on methods of improving
immune control of residual HIV-

1 viral infection during highly
active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART), in particular using
immunotherapeutic vaccines.

Rinaldo also is professor of
pathology at the School ofMedi-
cine and assistant director of the
clinical rnicrobiologylaboratory,
with primary responsibility for
the clinical virology laboratory
at UPMC. This laboratory per-
forms tests for diagnosis of viral
and chlamydial infections.

Thomas E. Starzl, direc-
tor emeritus of the Thomas E.
Starzl Transplantation Institute,
professor of surgery at the
School of Medicine and widely
known as the “father of liver
transplantation,” was among six
transplant surgeons recognized
at a special reception in July at
the National KidneyFoundation
2004 U.S. Transplant Games in
Minneapolis.

Starzl performed the ﬁrst
human liver transplant in 1963
and the first successful liver
transplant in 1967. Thirteen
years later, Starzl brought trans-

plantation a step forward when
he introduced anti—lymphocyte
globulin and cyclosporine,
the next stage in immunosup—
pressive medication after the
development of azathioprine
and corticosteroid. These dis-
coveries advanced the ﬁeld for
transplantation and became the
accepted form of treatment for
patients with liver, kidney and
heart failure.

By 1989, Starzl introduced
the anti-rejection medication
F K506, which served to increase
survival rates for liver and other
organ transplants. This led the
way to successful surgeries for
