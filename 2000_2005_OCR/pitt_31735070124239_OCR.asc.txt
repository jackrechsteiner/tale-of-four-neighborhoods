get creative with their

bids for the University’s
health insurance business.
_ Pitt’s exclusive contract with
UPMC Health Plan expires
June 30, 2003. The University
recently sent RFPS (requestsfor
proposals) to the major players
in western Pennsylvania’s health
insurance ‘market: UPMC Health

back to Pitt later this month. .

long-term staff, two social work
staffers learned recently.

In July, Pitt’s administra-
tion announced that $8 million
would be trimmed Univer-
sity—wide from the ﬁscal year
2003 budget. Chancellor Mark ‘
Nordenberg said at the time
that some Pitt units could reach
their reduced budget goal by not
ﬁlling open positions. “But this is
not a budget that is built around
the expectation that there will be

any signiﬁcant layoffs and posi-

tion reductions,” Nordenberg
added. ‘ r _

P This week, however, Provost
James Maher acknowledgedthat

‘ some staff layoffs‘ and position
-eliminations had already taken

place and others likelywill follow.
He declined to specify which
units have been affected.

“It’s no secretithat all units‘

have been asked to take budget

cuts,” Maher told the University A

Times yesterday. “How manywill
take cuts in the form of stafﬁng
changes, I don’t know at this
point. I do know that there have

 UNIVERSITY TIMES

Pitt could see more attempts by

legislators to “micro—manage”

I ast year, a Pennsylva-
nia legislator proposed
an amendment to the

University’s state funding bill

that would have required Pitt

to reimburse the state for legal
expenses incurred by the Penn-
sylvania Turnpike Commission
due to actions taken by Pitt’s

Environmental Law Clinic.

The amendment was aimed
at punishing the clinic for rep-
resenting groups ﬁghting the

Mon-Fayette Expressway proj-

ect. (State lawmakers already

had barred Pitt from spending
state money on the clinic itself
because it had represented groups
opposed to logging in the Allegh-
eny National Forest.)
Pennsylvania’s House of Rep-

resentatives initially approved a

Pitt appropriation bill with the

amendment included. But the

legislator who introduced the’

amendment, Rep. Thomas A.
Michlovic, D-Allegheny County,
later had second thoughts and
made it clear he would not ﬁght
for the amendment when Pitt’s
bill came up for a second vote in
the House. The state Senate cut
the amendment from Pitt’s bill,

. and the House concurred.

But that probably won’t be
the last time that state lawmak-
ers threaten to micro—manage
the University, ‘Pitt Harrisburg

tee (BPC) last week.

this money, and we have a right
to inﬂuence how you use it. And
it shouldn’t be used to take on a
commonwealth agency like the
turnpike commission.”

In recent years, the best-
known example of state interfer-

ence in the University’s internal -

affairs concerned health beneﬁts
for Pitt employees’ same—sex

partners. At one point, legisla-

tors threatened to withhold Pitt’s

I state funding if the University

extended the beneﬁts.
Currently, legislators are
taking a wait-and—see attitude
on the issue, said Supowitz and
Charles F. McLaughlin, assistant
director of commonwealth rela-
tions. » .
Supowitz told BPC: “I’ve
heard legislators who support the
concept of same—sex health ben-
eﬁts make one of the same points
that the University’s committee
[that studied the issue] made in
its report to. the chancellor last
year — that there needs to be a

coordinated effort by all four of »
’ the state-related universities” to ~

convince Harrisburg of the need
for offering the beneﬁts. -
“There are a few legislators
who are supportive [of allowing
state—supported universities to
offer same—sex health beneﬁts],
there are a lot who would ‘very
much frownon that kind of ini-

tiative; eandthere are probablya

good many in the middle some-
where,” said Supowitz. ’

He and McLaughlin quoted
James Carville’s description of
‘social. and politicalattitudes in
Pennsylvania: “You’ve got,Phila-
delphia atone end of the state,-
Pittsburgh at the other end, and
Alabama in the middle.”

Pitt has requested a 5 per-
cent increase in its state appro-

priation for the ﬁscal year that
begins on July 1, 2003. BPC
members asked: How realistic
is that request, given the grow-
ing likelihood that Pennsylvania
will face another $1 billion-plus
deﬁcit this year? ,

“I would say,’if the worst pre-
dictions come true in terms, of the
economy, that 5 percent probably
is unlikely,” Supowitz said.

On the otherhand, a 5 percent
increase “is not an unreasonable
request and it’s one that can easily
bedefended,” McLaughlin said.
“We can go to the legislature
and the governor’s ofﬁce and say,

- ‘This is really just 1 percent more

than the University was promised
two years ago” before lawmakers
imposed mid-year cuts.
Political and economic
conditions in Pennsylvania are
especially unpredictable right

now, McLaughlin and Supowitz I

said, citing an uncertain economy,
the upcoming election of a new

, governor and a new session of the

General Assembly.

The governor “sets the bar”
for state funding of higher edu-
cation when he announces his
proposed budget each February,

noted McLaughlin. Last year,_

for example, Gov. Schweiker
proposed cutting funding to
Pitt and Pennsylvania’s other
state—supported universities by
5_percent. Ultimately, Schweiker

* land the 'General~Assembly:com--- -

promised on a 3.6 percent Cut.
McLaughlin said: “Do you
think, if Gov. Schweiker had
come to the General Assembly
with his budget last year and it

had proposed holding our fund- - ’

ing even, with no cuts, that the
legislature would have cut us by
F 6 percent and gotten awaywith
it? Noway.” ,

UI\IIVERSITV SENATE

 

M A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

At the Sept. 1 1 Senate Council meeting, Chan-
cellor Mark N ordenberg vigorously_ defended
the University, in response to a Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette article describing Pitt’s practice of exclud-
ing the test scores of “special access” students
and athletes from the calculation of the average
SAT score of incoming freshmen. Although not

, speciﬁcally stated, the article intimated that Pitt’s
practice was misleadingto those interested in the
average SAT score for entering freshmen.

The chancellor’s statement at the meetingwas carefully phrased
and similar in approach to other statements he has made explain.-
ing and defending Pitt policies and practices. VVhether one agrees
or disagrees with the chancellor’s statements, almost everyone
would agree that he mounts as good a defense as one could hope
would be made by the University’s chief executive. VVhen I have
differed with a practice or policy the chancellor has defended, I
nevertheless have been highly impressed by the skill with which
he presented his, or the University’s, position.

Onthe same day the chancellor gave his response to Senate
Council, the Post-Gazette ran an editorial that follows the pre-
vailing pattern of Post-Gazette editorials and articles by its editor
John Craig. From reading editorials in other cities’ newspapers,

 

prone to snide and smug statements. For example, in the Sept.
1 1 editorial about SAT scores, the Post—Gazette pointed out that,
for the current year, 10 percent of the freshman scores were not
reﬂected in the SAT average, but that 18 percent had not been
included 10 years earlier. The editorial referred to this difference
with the words, “1O years ago it was worse.” I could see the use
of the term “greater,” but the term “worse” suggests that leaving
the 10 percent of the students out was bad, and not defensible,
and that when 18 percent were not included it was even more
misleading. One might have expected the author" of the editorial
to treat the reduction of the student scores excluded now as an
improvement and a positive development.

Several ‘faculty members asked me whether I knew that the
University had adjusted the SAT average score. I was not aware
of the practice, but knew that there were a variety of special
admission categories. All the faculty members with whom I talked

indicated that they had no knowledge of the practice, although

about a practice that is defensible or, even better, sound,’ why was
it not more widely known, since it apparently was in effect since
the 1960s?.Did the fact that the practice was not well—known
indicate that those responsible for creating and maintaining it
believed that, if known, it might diminish the positive meaning
the reported average score would have? ’ . I

. This question leads to a_ larger concern: , VVho determines
which information ‘is to be made widely available to the public,
which information is to be held closely, and which criteria are
applied in the decision-making process?  '

There isa tendency at the University. of Pittsburgh to be
somewhat obsessive about maintaining the secrecy of information,
unless it is clearly positive in nature, such as the award and size of i
a research grant,’ or an achievement of the chancellor or another
University leader." In fact, both at the University level and the
unit level, the idea of sharing information seems at times quite
foreign. One possible reason for the University to hold information
closely is bad experiences with media coverage. From my own.
experience as a--member of the Senate athletic committee during
a previous administration, it appeared theathletic department
was paranoid about the press, which frequently criticized the

ship as hostile to it and the University. _, . . .
Perhaps, at some meeting of the upper echelon of the Univer-
sity administration, a session might be devoted to the pros and
cons of being more open with the University community and the
general public. I believe the University has more to gain than to
lose by increased openness. Regarding the average freshman SAT
score, if each time it had been reported to the University board,
or otherwise made known, the score had been accompanied by

a footnote explaining the exclusions, the entire brouhaha might :-

well have been avoided. Experience suggests that when media
learn a fact that appears to have been kept secret, it seizes upon
the opportunity to portray the fact  the worst possible light.
Reporters know they are much more likely to win a Pulitzer
for writing about frailties of a person or an institution than for
a story about good works. Potential critics can be disarmed by
the University being forthcoming from the outset. Even a good
defense is just a defense. . I

director says.

The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are
expected to vote as early as today, Oct. 10, on a resolution
that would authorize President Bush to order unilateral
American military action against Iraq. ’

In a nationally broadcast speech Monday night, Bush
called Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein “a murderous tyrant”.

UNIVERSITY TIMES: Under what conditions, if
any, would you support a U.S.-led military invasion
of Iraq? a

KELLER: I can’t conceive of any conditions under which
I would support a unilateral U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
because I don’t thinkthe goal should be to depose Saddam

Hussein. The goal should be to re—institute inspections

Pitt’s William W. Keller agrees with the “murderous
tyrant” label but disputes Bush’s assessment of the threat
posed by Saddam. . ~

“I don’t think that Saddam Hussein now presents

any direct threat to the security of the United States,” .

said Keller, who is the inaugural holder of the Wesley
W. Posvar Chair in International Security Studies and
a professor in the Graduate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs (GSPIA).

Keller also is the new director of the Matthew B.
Ridgway Center for International Security Studies, part
of GSPIA and Pitt’s University Center for International
Studies. _ «

“Saddam doesn’t have ballistic missiles or aircraft that
can reach us,” Keller said. “And he doesn’t, according to
recent British intelligence reports and U.S. unclassiﬁed
material, possess nuclear weapons and isn’t projected to
have them for another one-to—ﬁve years, although he
does have chemical and biological weapons.

“The threat is that if we engage him militarily, he
might use his chemical and biological weapons against
us or our allies in the region — here, Israel is the obvi-
ous candidate.” ‘

Before coming to Pitt this fall, Keller was executive
director of the Center for International Studies at Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology and research director
of M.I.T.’s Japan Program. Prior to joining M.I.T. in
1997, Keller served for two years as associate profes-,
sor and deputy director at the Center for Trade and
Commercial Diplomacy in the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. ' »

From 1987 to 1995, Keller was project director and
senior analyst for the U.S. Congress’s Office of Technol-
ogyAssessment in Washington, D.C. He is the author or
co—author of numerous articles, reports and other pub-
lications and has written three books: “The Myth of the
Global Corporation” (co—author; Princeton University
Press, 1998), “Arm in Arm: the Political Economy. of
the Global Arms Trade” (Basic Books, 1995) and “The
Liberals and]. Edgar Hoover: Rise and Fall of a Domestic
Intelligence State” (Princeton University Press, 1989).
He co-edited the book “Crisis and Innovation in Asian
Technology,” which Cambridge University Press is
publishing this year.

Keller holds an A.B. degree in philosophy from Princ-
eton University (l975) and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
government from Cornell University (1985 and 1986,
respectively). ’

He talked with the University Times this week ‘

—-— Bruce Steele:

How should you do that? You should work multi—lat-
erally through the United Nations, even if it takes two
U.N. resolutions and the threat of measured amounts
of force to get the inspectors back into Iraq. We must
have open, impromptu, immediate inspections of any site,
including Saddam’s presidential palaces. If our inspection
teams are met with hostile forces, then we evacuate our
people’ and bomb the site or sites in question. -

The Bush administration says that Saddam Hussein
is a master at duping and stringing along the U.N.
and Western leaders who are all too willing to play
Chamberlain to his Hitler.
' The Hitler analogy really doesn’t make much sense to
me. I suppose you could say that when Saddam attacked
Kuwait, that was like Hitler going into the Rhineland.
But in the case of Hitler’s Germany, you had a very
powerful nation with overwhelmingly strong military
forces in the center of Europe. With Iraq, you have a
weak and rather disorganized military force that is no
match for our own. i V

I think Saddam is fairly well contained, atleast militar-
ily. He doesn’t seem to be seeking to invade other states
or impose an ideology, beyond his own borders. VVhat
we have to worry about are his weapons of mass destruc-
tion. That should be the focus of our policy in Iraq — to
remove those weapons, if necessary by force, the kind of
measured force I was talking about earlier.

The Bush administration claims to have clear evidence
of links between Saddam’s regime and al-Qaida.

So far, I haven’t seen any credible link between al-
Qaida and Saddam Hussein and his government. About
the strongest link that we’ve seen is Condoleezza Rice,
the national security adviser, saying something along the
lines of: There have been some contacts between al-Qaida
and Saddam’s government, and they go back quite a ways.
Well, that’s not very hard intelligence. And then you have
the secretary of state, Colin Powell, saying, essentially:
There is no smoking gun. We’re looking for one all of
the time, but we haven’t found it.

In hisspeech Monday night, President Bush likened a
pre-emptive strike against Iraq toJFK’s authorization
of a U.S. naval blockade in 1962 to prevent Soviet
missiles from reaching Cuba. Bush said: “Facing clear
evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the ﬁnal proof
— the smoking gun —— that could come in the form
of a mushroom cloud.” _

The two situations are hardly "comparable. In the

 §*

Cuban missile crisis, the Soviet Union was prepared to
base ICBMs —— missiles that could reach any part of the
United States — within 90 miles of our shore, and they
could have been carrying nuclear warheads. In the cur—
rent situation, there is an implied possibility that Iraq
could somehow get a weapon of mass destruction — one

of them, perhaps two, and not a nuclear weapon —— to
‘ CHE un11:E'a Dtdlcb. ’ ‘ " "   ’ = ' ‘» * 

In the case of the Cuban missile crisis, there was a
clear and present danger and there was hard evidence,
which Adlai Stevenson [U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations] showed to-the U.N. Security Council in the
form of photographs of the missile facilities in question.
With Iraq today, it’s more a question of what might be
possible in the future.

This doesn’t mean that we should do nothing about
Saddam Hussein. VVhat it means is that we should renew
our efforts to remove his weapons of mass destruction
and make that the focus of our energies rather than
attempting to topple his regime.

The Bush administration is having difﬁculty selling
the U.N. Security Council -— France and Russia,
in particular — on the need for stringent weapons
inspections in Iraq, backed up by the threat of an
immediate military invasion if Saddam doesn’t
cooperate. _

I think the Bush administration brought this trouble
upon itself. There has been some difficulty in getting
members of the permanent ﬁve on the Security Council,

other than Britain, to go along with us. This is partly.

because some of our diplomacy has been mishandled.

The Bush administration has gone to Congress and
said: “Give us tremendous war power to attack Iraq. We ’re
going in no matter what the U.N. does.” Now, this tends
to undermine not only the authority of the U.N. but also
our own negotiating position vis-a—vis our allies and other
members of the Security Council. Because, in effect, what
we’re saying” to them is: “We want you to make all of
these concessions to us. But in the ﬁnal analysis it doesn’t
matter what you do because the U.N. is irrelevant. The
United States is going to take matters into its own hands
if it believes that its security is at stake.”

Is the Bush administration playing a subtler. game
than it’s being given credit for? Maybe the president
is talking tough primarily to establish aviable-sound-
ing threat of aiunilateral U.S. attack, ‘so that other
countries can warn Iraq’s government: “Look, if you
don’t back down on weapons inspections, those crazy
Americans are going to destroy you.”

That’s a credible theory, except that the tough talk
has been going on for so long. It’s difﬁcult to think of an
instance where a president started talking months and
months before the fact that there was going to be a U.S.
attack on another country. ‘

Bush has created a viable threat of a unilateral attack.

But let’s look at the implications
of such an attack. If we go in and
try to topple Saddam’s govern-
ment, we’re probably talking
about an attack on Baghdad,
and this would be a very differ-
ent scenario than we saw in 1991.
Back then, Saddam moved into
Kuwait, dug into the sand and
waited. The United States and its
allies built up a very large inva-
sion force, and when they were
good and ready they attacked and

r routed Saddam’s forces.

Saddam learned from that
experience. Today, he doesn’t
have the same quality of forces
or the same abundance of equip-
ment that he had in 1991. A lot
of it was destroyed during the

-Gulf War and a lot of it has

deteriorated since then. This
time, he’s much more likely to
withdraw his forces into Baghdad
and force the United States into
a nightmarish scenario where
wewould be ﬁghting house to
house and street to street, and he
would pack the most signiﬁcant
targets with women and children.

‘In that case, we would have not

only hand—to—hand combat in
the streets but also a lot of body
bags and full CNN coverage. The
American people don’t- tend to
support their boys coming home

in body bags for very long.

What do you think of the vision
of toppling Saddam and estab-
lishing the ﬁrst Arab demo-
cratic republic in Iraq, the hope
being that democracies would
then blossom throughout the
Middle East?

Well, it’s a very ﬁne vision, and
it would be a very ﬁne thing. But
there is no history of democracy
in that region. There’s no par-
ticular reason to believe that the
people would know how to run a

democracy. It’s no simple thing. A

We have troubles with it all of
the time in our own democracy,
which is veryimperfect.

The Iraqis don’t have the nec-
essary institutions in place. If we
succeeded in toppling Saddam’s
government, there would be
quite a lot of instability inside
Iraq among the warring factions
and tribes that would emerge
almost immediately — and
perhaps instability between Iraq
and its immediate neighbors.
Remember, it wasn’t so long
ago that Saddam fought a major
war against Iran.

We might also see, during
the actual battle between U.S.
or coalition forces and Iraqi
forces, the use of unconven-
tional weapons. In that kind of
scenario, things tend to become
unglued and it’s very, very hard
to put them back together again.

So, if we were to go in and topple
the Iraqi government, that would

4

be the easy part. The hard part
would be the next dozen years
or so, when we would have to
reconstruct the country.

Could Saddam Hussein’s Iraq
be like Castro’s Cuba in the
sense that there’s the hope: If
we can keep the peace until the
current ruler dies, maybe his
successors will be less threat-
ening?

History certainly has some-
thing to teach us about this. I was

Weapons of mass destruction
tend not to get used by states.
Nuclear weapons have not been
used since the ﬁrst two U.S. uses
over 50 years ago. There is a tre-
mendous presumption and norm
against the use of chemical and
biologicalweapons, although that
norm was eroded somewhat by
Iraq’s use of chemical weapons
in the Iran-Iraq war.

The great problem is that we
are only at the dawn of nuclear
proliferation. We don’t have the
institutions or the mechanisms
yet to deal with the kinds of
proliferation we’re likely to see in
the future. That’s what we should
be thinking about: forming coali-
tions to make sure that terrorists
never get their hands on weapons
of mass destruction.

President Bush might reply

that that’s exactly why we
should not hesitate to act alone
and pre-emptively against Iraq
— because Saddam is fully
capable of turning his weap-
ons of mass destruction over to
terrorists who share his hatred
of America. , ,
A unilateral U.S. action is

“If we can remain calm and wait it

a child of the Cold War. I was
raised to believe that the Soviets
were the bad guys and we’ were
the good guys. As ‘I grew older, I
could see that it came down to a
great ideological battle between
capitalism and communism.

Somehow, about 12 years ago,
all of that disappeared. The Berlin
Wall came tumbling down, the
Germanys were reunited, the
Soviet Union came apart at the
center, and some form of capi-
talism began to insinuate itself
into the formerly communist
regime. _

That’s an example of a much
bigger threat than Saddam Hus-
sein coming undone by more or
less natural economic and politi-
cal forces.

I think this is a waiting game.
If we can remain calm and wait
it out, we’ll be much —better off.
But, having said that, if there
was incontrovertible proof that
Saddam Hussein had a nuclear
weapon, Iwould be for some kind

VVhat do you consider to be
the greatest threat or threats

to U.S. national security? Ter- V

rorism? Economic and social
problems? A military attack
against us or some ally we’d
be obligated to defend?

The greatest threat to the
United States would be a terror-

mosity against us in the Middle
East and the Persian Gulf, and
it’s also likely to break apart the

oalition of allies and friends
who would be willing to help us
in building the broader institu-
tions we need to ‘slow down
proliferation and curtail it i_n
the future.

I believe that the most prudent
course would be for us to wait
until after the elections and then
assemble the friends and allies
that we need to move against
Iraq in a way that will assure
successful inspections.

Unfortunately, I think the
president’s speech Monday
night will preclude that option.
Indeed, it seems likely now that
the Congress will vote to give
broad war power authority to
the president.

Are you surprised that almost

, 13 months have passed since

Sept. 11,2001, without a

' major terrorist attack against '

the United States?

I was one of the people who
was surprised that the attack of
Sept. 11 took so long in coming.
I had been expecting it for about

'10 years. So, I’m probably not a

very good authority on this ques-
tion. I’m certainly grateful that
another attack hasn’t happened.

Is it just a matter of time until
there is another attack by al-
Qaida or other terrorists
against the United States or
its military bases, businesses
and embassies abroad?

I think it is a matter of time,

yes. But there is a great deal that
we can do either to extend that
time or bring us closer to it. It’s
almost a stimulus—response kind

of exercise. If we have a bellig— A

erent foreign policy in which
we launch pre—emptive strikes
against countries like Iraq, we’re
likely to fuel the ﬁres of terrorism
around the world.

One of the principal beliefs
behind terrorism against the
United States is that we are a
kind of evil empire. Before we

‘launch what could appear to be

an unprovoked attack on Iraq or
some other country, we should
think about what the CIA calls
“blowback” — the notion that
there are consequences that
come back at a country because
of things it’s done in the past. 4

We have to start thinking very
carefully about our foreign policy
in terms of the responses it’s going
to elicit from terrorists. This is
very different from a policy of
Capitulation. One should never
negotiate with, or capitulate to, a
terrorist. But one can do an awful
lot about the underlying condi-
tions that tend to make terrorism
more violent.

VVhat forms are terrorist.

attacks against America most-
likely to take in the future?
That’s impossible to predict.
They could take any form at all.
And I don’t think it necessarily
has to be an escalating kind of
scenario. It might be weapons
of mass destruction or it might
be car bombs. It might be more
airplane hijackings or it could be
human beings blowing . them-

“ ‘ selves’-up in“ '1”imes“Square.  

As I study terrorism, I ,don’t
see a trend toward escalation,
with the one exception of Sept.
11, either in the frequency of
events or in their destructive
power. '

Prior to September 2001 ,
some policymakers and politi-
cal pundits were warning that
North Korea posed an imme-
diate threat’ to world peace.
Likewise, peace allegedly

would be better to keep a focus
on terrorism while also looking
at other issues that are crucially
important to the United States.

You mentioned our nuclear
deterrence agreement with
North Korea.

VVhen we thought that the
North Koreans were creating a
nuclearweapon, we agreed thatif
theywould cease their production
of such weapons we would help
them build nuclear reactors and
that the I.A.E.A. [International
Atomic Energy Agency] would
come in.

With North Korea, we
were able to,take a very back-
ward regime, work with it and,
hopefully, either slow or stop
their nuclear program. It didn’t
require an invasion. One would
think that we could have tried a
similar approach with Iraq.

Ifyou were to designate an axis
of evil, which countries would
make your list?
I would never designate such
‘a thing. It’s not a matter of good
versus evil. It’s a matter of states
behaving properly or not. It’s a
matter of international criminal
activity. Bringing in the question
of good or evil devolves it to an
emotional issue that might have
more to do with gettingvotes and
getting re—elected than it does
with solving the problem.
In that regard, something that
I think was, at best, a serious mis-
calculation and, at worst, thor-
oughly cynical was the decision to
begin this enormous debate about
Iraq just a few weeks before the

and by ethnic genocide, AIDS
and starvation in sub-Saharan
Africa.

One of the real problems with
our response to the horriﬁc events
of Sept. 1 1 was that other security
and economic issues were sent to
the back burner. The weakness
of the economy has been almost
ignored by the Bush administra-
tion. Our nuclear agreementwith
North Korea has not been looked
at very carefully.

This administration seems
to have a single-minded focus
on terrorism, so much so that
it makes a linkage that may not

weapons of mass destruction. It

professor emeritus says.

“This is particularly true for
the Department of Psychology,”
according to Merle]. Moskowitz.
Following his retirement from
teaching and administration,
Moskowitz has been writing the
last of four chapters of his history

A ~ of Pitt’s psych depart-

  

2004 will celebrate
its 100th year. Mos-
kowitz has covered
the ﬁrst 70 years in
chapters 1-3.
The book traces

the department’s cur-
ricula and programs,
ecords the numbers of
 graduates and faculty and
‘ ome oftheirachievements
from era to era, cites impor-
tant hirings and departures,
mentions certain “firsts,”
such as the first master’s

1913), and covers theshifting

the occasional per-

non—central orwhich had become
so strong within themselves that
they needed a separate depart-
ment, like neuroscience,” Mos-
kowitz says.

Other such spin-offs include
educational psychology, busi-
ness psychology and speech
audiology.

In addition, the department
and various segments of the mor-
phing discipline of psychology
were shuffled to and fro — both
physically and administratively
— over the years, until ﬁnally
landing this fall, more or less in
toto, in Sennott Square, Pitt’s
newest academic building.

Moskowitz is especially quali-
ﬁed to write this history, since
the department has been his
academic home for more than 50
years. After winning a four-year
undergraduate scholarship to Pitt
for earning the highest score on
a district American history test,
the McKeesport native earned a
bachelor’s degree in psychology
in 1950 and a master’s in ’52 . After
completing his doctorate at Har-
vard and teaching for ﬁve years
at Bowdoin College in Maine, he
joined the Pitt psychology faculty
in 1959 and has been here ever
since.

His love of history in general,
and institutional history in par-
ticular, coupled with many years
of teaching the department’s
History of Psychology course,

The first chapter, which
covers 1904-195 1, was written in
1987-1988 following a sabbatical
of research on the project. “My
job here for 22 years or so was as
associate chairman of the ‘depart-
ment. I was responsible for the
day to day operation, working
with ﬁve different chairs over
that time,” he says, which gave
him access to internal records
to supplement the University’s

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

In part because there were
no takers to publish Chapter 1
of the manuscript, and in part
because the succeeding years
included mostly people he knew
personally, Moskowitz shifted
his approach starting with chap-
ter 2.

“I decided to write the second
part(1952 — 1969) and succeeding
parts in a less formal and more
personal style, more memoir than
history,” keeping to the facts,
but adding his interpretations
of them, he says.

Moskowitz hopes to com-
plete the history in time for the
department’s 100th anniversary
celebration. The plan at this point
is to post at least the ﬁrst chapter
of Moskowitz’s history as a link
to the department’s homepage as
part of the celebration.

According to Moskowitz,
the two most important aspects
of the department’s history are the
strong personalities involved in
psychology and in Pitt’s admin-
istration “and the way the ﬁeld
of psychology is going at a given
time — the Zeitgeist, the spirit of
the times,” he says.

Since the department’s found-
ing in 1904 and continuing
through the University’s move
from Downtown Pittsburgh

to Oakland, Pitt had a strong
experimental psychology pro-
gram housed in what’s now Arts
and Sciences.

says, “ﬁ‘om about 1912, there was ‘

a clinical "program, technically
called the psycho-educational lab
and clinic. It was primarily geared
to testing children and dealing
with either retarded or superior
or handicapped children who
were in the educational system.
Somewhat later the program
moved into more clinical treat-
ment, that is, studying emotional
disorders.”

Wallace Wallin was the
founder of the clinic and he had

UNIVERSITY TIllIlES

UPMC alters Oakland plans but

Pitt biomedical science facility
still scheduled for construction

System and Pitt announced

a seven-year, $600 million
Oakland medical campus renewal
project with much fanfare. The
plans included construction of
three major new facilities, two
by UPMC and one by Pitt.

UPMC’s plans have been
altered radically as the result of
an August deal to purchase St.
Francis Hospital in Lawrencev-
ille and move Children’s Hospital
of Pittsburgh to that site. The
agreement also calls for construc-
tion of a new pediatric research
facility on the St. Francis site.

VVhile the new agreement
cancels UPMC’s plans to con-
struct an inpatient facility and a
child and ambulatory care center
near UPMC Monteﬁore, Pitt is
continuing with its portion of the
original project.

A new Biomedical Science
Tower 3 (BST3) will be built on
the site of the Lhormer Build-
ing on Fifth Avenue between
Lothrop and Darragh streets.

The property and facilities
committee of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees this week approved
the $188 million construction

I 11 June 2001, UPMC Health

project, which is expected to be
completed in 2006 or 2007. The
project could begin by the end
of 2002 with the clearing of the
Lhormer Building site.

BST3 will be a 10—story
(plus basement) building, hous-
ing some 50 research groups in
about 325,000 gross square feet
of space, according to informa-
tion distributed by the trustees
committee, which is authorized
to approve Pitt construction
projects over $1 million. The
new building will help allevi-
ate overcrowded lab space, and
better position the University
to capitalize on research funding
to further biotechnology-based
economic development in the
region, according to the trustees’
background statement.

The plan includes construct-
ing connecting bridges from
BST3 to Victoria Hall and to
the Biomedical Science Tower.

Funding sources for the BST3
include: $62 million in gift funds;
$80 million in debt ﬁnancing;
$45 .4 million in University funds,
and $629,000 in commonwealth
funds, according to background
information.

' According to Ana Guzman,
associate vice chancellor for
Facilities Management, Pitt
will develop a staging plan for
constructing the new bioscience
tower once a deal is ﬁnalized with
a construction management ﬁrm.
The staging plan then requires
city approval, she said.

“It is expected that now that
the Children’s construction
plans have changed, it will be
easier to stage the construction
of this project,” Guzman said.
“We expect to break ground in
March of 2003 .”

Pitt is close to signing an
agreement with Mascaro/Hunt,
a local construction manage-
ment ﬁrm, for the BST3 project,
according to Pitt spokesperson
Robert Hill.

As for UPMC’s revised plans,
Jane Dufﬁeld, UPMC Health
System spokesperson, said: “We

-don’t anticipate the new Chil-

dren’s in Lawrenceville, which
will include a pediatric research
facility addition to the existing St.
Francis facility, to be ready until
2007. But some decisions have
been made for the short term.”

Duffield said Children’s

Hospital in Oakland will remain
operational until the opening of
the Lawrenceville facility.

After the new Children’s
opens in Lawrenceville, the
current Children’s in Oakland
will be renovated and used by
UPMC Presbyterian to handle
patient overﬂow.

Dufﬁeld added that the sites
originallyscheduled forconstruc—
tion north and south of UPMC
Monteﬁore will be converted into
landscaped green space.

Clean—up efforts, prior to
the landscaping, have begun in
the area of Terrace Street and
Chesterﬁeld Road,'where some
houses had been demolished by
UPMC under the now-outdated
plan. Green space also will be cre-
ated at the intersection of Fifth

Avenue and Chesterﬁeld, which '

was to be the site of a new child
and adult ambulatory care center
prior to the UPMC agreement
with St. Francis.

It’s premature to determine
what the long—term use of those
spaces will be, Dufﬁeld said.

‘ Other plans now abandoned
as a result of the St. Francis agree-
ment include a second helipad
(the one on top of UPMC Pres-
byterian will continue in opera-
tion) and a pedestrian tunnel
under Fifth Avenue. The tunnel
was to connect the proposed
ambulatory care center to a

proposed underground parking

garage in the 3400 block of Fifth.
“There’s no need for the tunnel
now,” Dufﬁeld said.

A consequence of the new
plans, Dufﬁeld added, will be
much less trafﬁc congestion in
the Fifth Avenue corridor of the
medical campus. “To put in the
landscaped areas is much less
intrusive than major construc-
tion,” she said.

According to a UPMC
press release announcing the
Children’s/St. Francis agree-
ment, UPMC Health System is
investing $2 70 million in a com-
plicated deal that includes a $2 5 0
million investment by Hi ghmark
Blue Cross Blue Shield.

The majority of the UPMC
investment is going to the con-
struction on the Lawrenceville St.
Francis site, with some money
being used to acquire St. Fran-
cis Cranberry and to purchase St.
Francis Health System’s interest
in the Community Care Behav-
ioral Health organization.

Highmark is providing $233
million to Children’s Hospital
of Pittsburgh to purchase the
Lawrenceville site and toward
construction there. Highmark
is putting up an additional $17
million to Jameson Health
System for the acquisition of
the St. Francis Hospital of New
Castle.

Part of the deal includes a
10-year- contract between High-
mark and UPMC Health System
providing Highmark’s members
with access to UPMC facilities
and physicians, the Aug. 19 press
release said.

“The clinical psychology pro-
gram in education was put into
Arts and Sciences and was melded
with experimental psychology, or
what would be referred to then
as academic psychology,” Mos-
kowitz says.

Bowman then proceeded
to purge the department of its
clinical thrust by refusing to
offer tenure to anyone with that
focus. Faculty got the message
and moved on.

“Bowman had this strong
religious belief, saying some-
thing like, ‘One cannot take the
soul of man and dissect him on a
laboratory table,’ which iswhat
he thought the experimental psy-
chologists were trying to do.”

Eventually, Wallin, founder of
the psycho-educational lab and
clinic, left in disgust and the
Chambers, the dean of educa-
tion quit, Moskowitz says.

Following Bowman’s retire-
ment, the department was
rebuilt by its new chair, Wayne
Dennis, who by training and
ﬁeld research had a strong ori-
entation to developmental as well
as experimental psychology. “For
the next seven or eight years, he
seeded the department in his
image. And since he was build-
ing from scratch, the department
was [almost all] young faculty,”
Moskowitz says.

In 1946, the department
moved from the former Alumni
Hall (now Eberly Hall) to the

16th floor of the Cathedral of

Leaning, providing more lab and

dations, though, were inadequate
to handle the massive inﬂux of
World War II veterans coming
asstudents, which forced classes
to be held all over campus and in
off—campus locations, and gradu-
ate students to teach many of the
department’s offerings.

Also in 1946, the department
hiredjohn C. Flanagan, who was
the founder of the American
Institutes for Research (AIR),
which subsequently became
afﬁliated with the department.
AIR secured government
contracts to do research on a
variety of applied areas, such as
the development of performance-
rating techniques for pilots and
air trafﬁc controllers, the’ design
of ﬁrst-aid training courses and
the study of the effectiveness of
American high schools.

Psych department programs

grew and new ones were intro-

duced as a result of the afﬁliation
with AIR.

“Flanagan was a pioneer in the
ﬁeld of human factors research
— and he taught a bitch of a
graduate statistics course, I can
tell you from personal experi-
ence. AIR attracted a number
of talented experimental psy-
chologists, outgrew their space
in thevCathedral and built what
is now the Information Sciences
Building as their headquarters,”
Moskowitz says.

In addition to its association
with AIR, the psychology depart-
ment achieved national recogni-
tion for its annual symposium,
which invited national ﬁgures
to speak on current trends in the
ﬁeld. “Most of the big names in
psychology at the time came to
speak,” Moskowitz says.

Although AIR eventually
moved its headquarters else-

where, ‘, Robert _Glaser,j one of -

its senior ofﬁcials," stayecf'a'r‘1<il

"took a tenured professorship in

the department. “He developed
funding for a learning research
laboratory, and then by combin-
ing with similar efforts in edu-
cation, Bob Glaser founded the
Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center, and that really put
psychology on the map here, and
is a model for other universities
even now, 40 years later.

“In 1951, Bob Patton, who-
later hired me, became chair
and stayed for 15' years,”.Mos-'
kowitz says.

_ “He was studying the effects
of electric-shock therapy on rats
and doing split brain research on
rats and monkeys so the whole
department orientation was
moving more and more toward
the biological, the experimental
and toward a very strong applied
orientation.”

Succeeding department chairs
had other leanings and research
interests, Moskowitz says. A

“The point is, that throughout
the department’s history, and it’s
not unique to Pitt’s psychology
department, it’s the background
of the people, and the leader-
ship of Pitt at a given time, that
explains why the department
itself changed, and sometimes
radically.

“My interest is the depart-
ment’s history is a combination

of things: I look at trends and '
changes in history and, at the '

same time, I guess as the result
of my psychology training,Ilook
at the people who made the his-
tory and what motivated them,

why they did what they did, why '

they became interested in what
they became interested in, and
how they affected the ﬁeld.”

Upon request, Pitt will forward
e—mail of faculty who die, resign

‘ die, resign or other-
wise leave Pitt, the’

University normally terminates
their Pitt e—mail accounts within
two weeks.

But if account owners (or

a surviving family members and

colleagues) request an exten-
sion, e—mail may continue to

be forwarded for up to one year

from the account of a terminated
faculty member.
Such an extension gives ter-

V minated faculty or their survivors

uaeegﬁtkgigs

time to tie up loose ends, said
Susan Sereika, co—chairperson of
the University Senate’s computer
usage committee.

. . Sereika told FacultyAssembly

about e—mail account extensions
duringan Oct. 1 report on current
issues, in Pitt computing.

To request an extension, the
account owner or his/her survi-
vors should contact the e—mail
account administrator‘ in the
owner’s responsibility center,

Sereika said.

NSF project

The Learning Research and

will co-manage a ﬁve—year,5 $35’ .
million National Science Foun- ‘

dation—funded project to reform
math and science education
nationwide. - .

Pitt will join with the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin to form Sys-
temwide Change for All Learners

' and Educators (SCALE). The
partnership includes four urban

school districts serving approxi-
mately 900,000 students —— Los-
Angeles, Denver, Providence,
R.I., and Madison, Wis.

SCALE will focus on ﬁve
key areas: , I '

‘ °Implementingthe bestmath
and science programs;

' Implementing in-depth
science, technology, engineer-
ing and mathematics study;

0‘ Reforming teacher educa-
tion in partner districts;

° Mounting a program of

‘peer tutoring aimed at keeping
\high school students who serve ,_
as tutors intimately engaged in

mathematics and science, and
' Implementing a compre-
hensive program of research
and evaluation. -
SCALE is aimed especiall
at students from minority and
low—income families, including

non-native English speakers.

Lacking equal opportunities to
learn basic inath and science,
such students are dropping out
of these courses in discouraging

numbers, according to LRDC

director Lauren Resnick.
LRDC and its Institute for
Learning will receive $2.85

million annually for the project, 0

which will involve major science

L and engineering departments and

the School of Education. Resn-
ickand Christian Schunn, LRDC
research scientist, will co—direct
the project. I

She also reported that faculty
increasingly are exceeding the 80
Mbs of bandwidth that Pitt pro-
vides for network/Intemet access.
That’s largely due to faculty use
of peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing soft-
ware such as KaZaA, Gnutella
and LimeWire, according to
Pitt’s Computing Services and
Systems Development (CSSD)
ofﬁce.

“It is estimated that 99 percent
oftheuse ofpeer—to—peersoftware
is for locating and downloading
copyrighted movies, songs and
software,” Sereika said. “Once

downloaded, these ﬁles become‘

available from -the individual’s

computer to anyone else using

the peer-to-peer software. ‘
“Peer-to-peer software uses

all available bandwidth when

sharing ﬁles, straining network
resources and exposing users to

-co ri ht infrin ement com-
PY 8 8

plaints when copyrighted ﬁles
are shared.”

Using sophisticated new
search engines, copyright hold-
ers can easily detect and report

copyright violations, Sereika

warned. “Computer users are
individually liable for any copy-
right infringement that they
commit,” she noted.

' Students. likewise are
saturating their Pitt—provided
bandwidth but they’re not clog-

reported that: .

° CSSD provides facultywith
free CD3 and computer software
(includingweb browsers, browser
plug-ins, ant:i—virus software) to
facilitate access to Pitt network
and computer accounts. Faculty

may obtain the CD3 and software
at any Pitt public computing lab
upon presenting their valid Uni-
versity ID.

0 The University’s new
student Web portal service
(my.pitt.edu) permits students
to customize their View of Pitt’s
various web sites and services,
in addition to commonly used
Internet—based services. CSSD

projects that this same portal
service will be available to faculty
by April 2003. “One of the nicest
features [of this service] is thatyou
will be able to see your e—mail via
the Web,” Sereika said.

° CSSD is devoting “signiﬁ-
cant resources” to ﬁghting com-
puter abuse, security breaches and
copyright infringement. “Com—
puters whose security has been
breached are frequently used as
a masked conduit of copyrighted
materials,” Sereika said.

“The best method for pro-
tecting personal" computers
from, abuse is to make sure
that the operating system and

application software are kept
up-to-date by applying patches
and updates issued by the soft-
ware publisher,” she said. “If you
suspect your computer’s security
has been compromised, report
incidents at abuse@pitt.edu or.
the Technology Help Desk” at
412/624—HELP. ‘
She urged faculty with any
Pitt computing and networking
problems to contact the Help

® UNIVERSITY TIMES

Hillman Cancer center opens

..--~.« 1

u_ring its first 17 years in

the war against cancer,

the University of Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute (UPCI)
has conducted gene therapy trials,
discovered protein markers for
human prostate, bladder and
colon cancers, and developed
andclinically tested the ﬁrst
synthetic peptide vaccine against
advanced cancers, among many
other achievements.

Prior to a news conference
yesterday to mark the. opening
of the Hillman Cancer Center
at UPMC Shadyside, cancer
survivor Mark Kosanovich
talked about a comparatively
minor —- yet signiﬁcant — new
UPCI achievement: valet parking
for patients.

“It’s going to be fantastic,”
Kosanovich said of the Hillman
Center’s patient-friendly park-
ing system. “I was diagnosed
with melanoma in March 2000.
I received great treatment at
UPMC Monteﬁore and Magee,
but the parking situation at each
of those hospitals was a zoo.”

Kosanovich, a mechani-
cal-electrical supervisor for the
National Institute of Occupa-
tional Safety and Health’s Pitts-
burgh Research Center, pointed
out: “The battle against cancer,
although it occurs in the body,
affects your mind just as much.
The facilities that they’ve built
here and the people who are
utilized here put you so much at
case. It takes the mental strain

away from you and your family,
so that it actually helps you to

ﬁght the battle.”

The $130 million Hillman
Cancer Center — a 350,000-
square—foot, comprehensive
cancer center — brings UPCI’s
academic and research programs
under one roof and serves as the
hub for the UPMC Cancer
Centers, a network of more
than 30 ofﬁce-based medical
oncology practices and regional
cancer centers in western Penn-
sylvania. The network employs
2,100 health care professionals,
including 185 physicians and 20
radiation physicists. A

The collaboration between
clinical investigators and basic
scientists at the center promises
to accelerate the discovery and
implementation of cancer pre-
vention, detection, diagnostic
and treatment approaches, said
UPCI director Ronald B. Her-
berman.

It also will make life easier for
UPMC cancer patients and their
families, he said. The Hillman
Cancer Center brings together
cancer specialists from 12 dif-

j ferent UPMC hospitals. Even

patients whose treatment had
been limited to UPMC Presby-
terian often had been required to
“traipse around quite a number
of places” within the huge Presby
complex, Herberman said. “Now,
all of the doctors will come to the
patients in the same place.”
Joining Herberman at
yesterday's news conference was
Andrew C. von Eschenbach,

director-of the’ National Cancer '9

Institute (NCI), which sets the

 

national agenda and allocates the
large majority of federal funding
for cancer research and educa-
tion. NCI allocates $34 million
annually to UPCI, which is the
region’s only NCI-designated
comprehensive cancer center
and one of only 43 in the United
States. 1
Von Eschenbach called
the Hillman Center a “great
resource for the entire country”
and a model for other cancer
centers. “Not only is there the

“I met: 

opportunity for multi-disciplin-
ary, integrated care here,” he
said, “but what this center is also
implementing is an exceptionally
effective mechanism for distrib-
uting state—of-the—art care more
widely throughout the region.”

..The Hillman Cancer Center
houses both a research pavilion
and a clinical pavilion connected
by a three—story atrium lobby that
was designed to offer awarm wel-
come to patients, visitors, physi-
cians, scientists and staff.

The research pavilion is
devoted to basic and traditional
research programs in areas
such as immunology, molecular

oncology and drug discovery. It
can accommodate more than 450
laboratory personnel.

The clinical pavilion is the
center for patient care. It offers
cancer prevention, risk assess-
ment, detection, treatment, and
stress and symptom management
services. It also includes waiting
rooms equipped with televisions
and play areas for children and

- access to a kitchen stocked with

beverages and light refresh-
ments. ) , 1
Sophisticated radiology ser-
vices such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), ultrasound, com-
puted tomography _(CT) and
positron emission tomography
(PET) are offered at the center.
A pedestrian bridge connects
the center to UPMC Shady-
side, where cancer surgery and
Intensity Modulated Radiation

. Therapy (IMRT) are conducted.

An advanced imaging technology,
IMRT focuses radiation beams
to the precise shapes of a tumor,
delivering a higher concentrated
dose while minimizing damage to
surrounding healthy tissue.
Herberman noted: “Much,
of the Hillman Cancer Center
is designed foratthe healthy
population — for risk assess-
ment, preventionprograrns and
early detection and diagnosis of
cancer.” - -
In addition to valet park-
ing, center amenities include
a’ patient and family education
and information center, a garden
and meditation area, a café, a gift
shop and a salon where’ patients
can receive salon services and

purchase wigs, hats,  care _~ ,

products and prostheses." . ‘ ,

assistant vice chancellor for
employee/labor relations, also
attended the meeting.

Davis did not return phone
calls from the University Times
yesterday.

Yamatani said both of the laid-
off social work employees were

secretarial staff with long—term.

service to the University. “One
of the staff members was with
the University for more than 40
years, the other for nearly 30,”
said Yamatani. Both staffers were
at the top of their salary ranges,
he said. Yamatani said he didn’t
know if that was a factor in the
school’s decision to lay off the two
staff members.

According to Yamatani, the
staffers were given two options:
Accept other positions at the
school at approximately a 40
percent cut in pay, or leave the
University and take a severance
package, which he declined to
deﬁne. The staff members took
the severance option rather than
the pay cut, he said.

The two staff members
were notiﬁed Sept. 30 of their
dismissal, and given two weeks’
notice, Yamatani said. Their posi-
tions are not expected to be ﬁlled
this ﬁscal year.

Social Work employs about
20 staff, including several part-
timers, according to a social work
staff member.

16

Concerning the rationale
behind the staff cuts, Yamatani
said, “When over 95 percent of
the hard budget is in personnel,
that is, salary and ‘beneﬁts, its
particularly difﬁcult to cut from
other resources without sacriﬁc-
mg quality.”

Provost Maher said decisions
about where to make cuts are up
to the individual unit’s leadership.
“The mandate from my ofﬁce to

Institutional Advanc

CONT FROM PAGE I _
we’re trying to make this a seam-
less and smooth transition.”

Novak said he has been

' trying to attend as many IA staff

meetings as possible since the
announcement “so people can
ask me questions and build trust
for me in this new position.”
Novak said he doesn’t think that
Carter’s resignation will hurt Pitt
fund raising.
“In this business, it’s real
importantthatyou rememberit’s
not your money, it’s the donors’
money, and it’s going to support
the educational, research and ser-
vice missions of this University.
This [fund-raising] group has
always understood that. I said to
our staff: ‘Remember, we repre-
sent Carols legacy. Its incumbent
on us to go out and work hard
and carry on.’”

in units’attempts to absorb cuts

each unit is to look carefully at
all resources, which does include
looking at stafﬁng. While units
are mandated to look'at- staff
as well as everything else,” no
other guidelines regarding staff
are given, he said. “When the
dust settles, how many staff will

be involved, I just don’t know at c

this point.” ' c

He added that it is Univer- 1“

sity policy to place employees

The timing of Carter’s depar-
ture “gives us the chance to do
some introspection, tosee how
we’re doing things,” Novak said.
“If we need to make adjustments,
we will. It also gives the Univer-
sity time to do a serious, national
search” for Carter’s permanent
successor. “VVhether it’s me or
somebody else, you get the new
person in position and then you
run with it. I would much rather
have that happen now than two
years before the scheduled end
of the campaign” in 2007. s

“We’ve got a lot of momen-
tum. There’s still a lot of excite-
ment about the armouncement
[of Pitt’s $1 billion campaign
goal], so that will carry us for a
while. We make this change in
leadership and thenwe startliring
on all cylinders and go through

 in comparable positionsat the

University whenever possible.

9 Staff Association Coun-
cil" _(SAC) President Barbara
Mowery had raised a related
issue at; a public meeting in
September. See Sept. 26.Um'ver-
sity Times, www.pitt.edu/utime:/
bk_i.rruer.btm ' '

Mowerytold the Sept. 1 1 SAC
meeting that the staff association
had asked Ron Frisch, associate
vice chancellor for Human
Resources, to investigate claims
that long-term staff are being
targeted for departmental budget
cuts. .

Mowery later told the Uni-
versity Times, “We had been
contacted by staff who were

to the end.” , V A .

* As for Carter’s professional
future, Novak said: “My guess
is that since this hit the press,
she’s gotten phone, calls from a

dozen or so head-hunters at other .
mstitutions. She is a proven pro— :

fessional fundraiser. In our busi-
ness, it would not be that unusual
for Carol to take some time off
— it could be six months or a year
— becausein the interim, she’ll
be able to consult pretty much
whenever she wants. Her phone

will ring off the hook, asking for_

her’ advice.” _

Will Carter do any consulting
for Pitt? 9 A

“Actually, I suspect that she
will,” N ovak replied.

When Carter was hired as IA

vice chancellor injanuary 1997, it 1

was her second go-around at Pitt.

‘concerned about the termination
of long-time staff, especially [in
the context of] the budget cuts
and some reorganization which
was taking place.”

In response to a query about
Mowery’s statement, Frisch told
the UniversityTimes on Sept. 2 5, '
“I am constantly looking at staff
issues in relationship to termina-
tions. I will be working with the
leadership ofthe StaffAssociation
Council on this subject; however,
this information is conﬁdential

and will-remain so.”

1 Neither Frisch nor Human
Resources ofﬁcial John Greeno
returned calls or e-mails from the
University Times yesterday.

RESEARCH NOTES

Pitt leads 1st
overnment
unded study

of anorexia

nervosa

Researchers at Pitt’s School of
Medicine will lead the ﬁrst gov-
ernment-funded genetic study of
anorexia nervosa.

The National Institute of

» Mental Health—funded study is

a ﬁve—year grant, with more than
$10 million in funding, which
brings together 11 groups of
researchers from North America
and Europe (10 clinical centers
and one to analyze data) to ﬁnd
regions of the human genome
that contain genes that inﬂu-
ence risk for anorexia. To ﬁnd
these regions, the researchers
will recruit families with two or
more members, mainly siblings,
who have or had anorexia ner-
vosa, and analyze the DNA from
the participants.

“There is no known treatment
for anorexia nervosa. Studies such
as this one should help us under-
stand how differences in the genes
of some individuals contribute to

this illness. These ﬁndings should

help develop truly effective thera-
pies,” said Walter H. Kaye, Pitt
professor of psychiatry and co-
principal investigator.

The research will build on
recent genetic studies supported
by the Price Foundation, a pri-
vate, European-based foundation
that included most of the same
investigators. Bernie Devlin,
Pitt associate professor of psychi-
atry and co—principal investigator,
noted that the Price Foundation
studies already have pointed to
four regions of the genome to
look for genes affecting suscep-
tibility to anorexia. Because this
is such a complex disease, a large
number offarnilieswillbe needed
to understand the genetic basis.

According to Wade Berret—
tini, professor of psychiatry at
the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine and co-
principal investigator, ﬁnding
400 families with two or more
members with anorexia nervosa
will be a challenge. _

Anorexia nervosa is a poten-
tially lethal illness. The eating
disorder is characterized bythe
relentless pursuit of thinness, the
obsessive fear of gaining weight,

Prof gets grant

James H-C. Wang, an
assistant professor of orthopae-
dic surgery, bioengineering, and
mechanical engineering has been
awarded a $2 0,000 research grant

from the Alternatives Research &

Development Foundation.

The grant is titled “A Novel
Approach to Study Biological
Mechanisms for Tendinitis.”
Wang has developed an in vitro
model system that allows direct
cyclic mechanical stretching of
human tendon fibroblasts. and
allows study of the cellular and
mechanical mechanisms respon-

sible for the development of

tendinitis, a common tendon
disorder affecting millions of
people in the United States. _
The proposed studies will
offer insights into the genesis
of tendinitis and will potentially
offer new strategies to prevent
and treat tendinitis more effec-
tively. Wang is a faculty member
of the Musculoskeletal Research
Center (MSRC), Department of
Orthopaedic Surgery.

Banerjee was awarded the
fellowship for his abstract titled
“Targeted Cancer Therapy for
Human Prostate Cancer via
Sigma Receptor.” ‘

Banerjee’s research focuses
on targeted cancer therapy by
developing vectors, and with the
help of these vectors, to deliver
therapeutically important bioac—
tive molecules like anti-cancer
drugs and therapeutic genes to
the tumor.

He received his bachelor’s
degree in chemistry in 1992 and

. master’s degree in 1994, both at

Savio L—Y. Woo, the A.B.
Ferguson Professor of Orthopae-
dic Surgery and director of Pitt’s

Musculoskeletal Research Center ‘

(MSRC), recently was awarded a
$1 .3 million grant by the National

. Institutes of Health (NIH) for a

study entitled “In situ Forces
in Normal and Reconstructed
ACLs." . 0 V 0; _
Total NIH grant funding
for the MSRC now exceeds $11
million. Co—investigators include
Richard E. Debski, an assistant
professor in the departments of

orthopaedic surgery and bioen— ‘,

gineering, and Freddie H. Fu,
the David Silver Professor and
chairperson of the Department of
Orthopaedic Surgery at UPMC
Health System.

The research project is also
in collaboration with Scott
Lephart of the Neuromuscular
Research Laboratory and Molly
Vogt of orthopaedic surgery

and epidemiology, as well as,

with consultant Thomas Andri-
acchi of Stanford University.
Together, they will use innova-
tive approaches to determine
the in situ force distribution of
the anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL) and ACL replacement

- graft during activities of daily

living. This-marks the fourth
time that the NIH has renewed
this project. -

The incidence of injury to
the ACL has been increasing.
Further, in some sports, the
rate of ACL injury for female
athletes is three times that for
males. While ACL reconstruc-
tion is a common treatment for
such injuries, ACL replacement
surgery using autografts is being

performed 75 ,0O0— 1 00,000 times .

per year in the United States
alone, and the results have not
been consistent in restoring knee
function to pre—injury levels.
Over 35 percent of patients
have been reported to have
complications or unstable knees
shortlyafterreconstructionwhile
long-term follow—up at ﬁve to
10 years also has revealed that
15-25' percent of patients have
unsatisfactory results. There-
fore, research efforts to better
understand the forces in ACL

1 replacement grafts during in viva

activities and to compare them
with the intact ACL‘ are needed to
design better surgical approaches
and rehabilitation protocols.

The objective is to measure
the in situ force distribution in
the ACL and ‘ACL replacement
graft during activities of daily
living and rehabilitation exer-
cises. In addition, rehabilitation
exercises will be rank—ordered
according’ to the forces in the‘
ACL replacement graft.

A newly developed robotic/
universal force—moment sensor
(UFS) testing system will be
employed to determine the

force distribution of the ACL V

and ACL replacement graft in
cadaveric knees based on in viva
kinematic data obtained from
healthy volunteers and ACL-
deﬁcient patients.

Also, the data obtained
can contribute to the design
of appropriate post—operative
rehabilitation regimens that are
scientiﬁcally based. I
