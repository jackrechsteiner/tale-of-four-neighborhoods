T The Cathedral of Learning is slowly being treated
to $200,000 worth of reconstructive surgery. 0
‘But the changes aren’t in or .on the Cathedral,
they’re on the ground surrounded by orange fencing.
Pitt is replacing the sandstone walkways and drive-
ways surrounding the Cathedral of Learning. The pro-
ject’s completion date was scheduled for before the fall
semester.
Because of a delay in receiving the sandstone tiles,
the proposed finish date has been pushed back to Sept.
29. ' ’

According to Pitt spokesman.Ken Service, workers
have the materials and are working on the walkways.

The project should be finished by the newly pro-
posed date to alleviate the inconvenience and the eye-

sore caused by the blocked——off walkway. .

Some of Pitt’s students findthe blockade a prob-
lem, but the majority of students don’t seem to mind
the orange fence. , ' 2

Having built a car packing 75
horsepower, with a top speed near
110 mph, some would say that the
Pitt Formula Society of Automotive-
Engineering team is the fastest,
most powerful team on campus.

Last May, Pitt’s racing team
placed 9th overall at the Formula
SAE International competition in
Pontiac, Mich. It was the first time
in the team’s 12-year existence that
they accomplished that feat.

In a race against 114 other
teams, Pitt’s number 34 car sped

past the competition to capture

fourth place in endurance, and 15th
in the autocross for an overall rank-
ing of ninth. 0

The drivers for the 22 kilometer
endurance race were ‘Jeremy Himes
and Brian Tone, A both senior
mechanical ’ engineers. The
endurance race, which takes place
on a tight winding course, must be
completed with no pit ‘stops.
Drivers " must complete the race
without adding gasoline or air to
the tires, and can only legallystop
to switch drivers. The team’s car
averaged approximately 45 mph in

DON SZEJK JR.
The Pitt News

Stephen Jesz pumped  arms and
built speed with each powerful stride. He
carefully kept the wheels of his skates on
the smooth asphalt, bent his knees and exe-
cuted a perfect right-hand spin.‘ As he
screeched to a quick stop, a wide grin
spread across his face.

.Jesz, an artist from Pittsburgh, had
been on the Eliza Furnace Trail only twice,
but he vowed to come back for more.

“It’s ﬂat, it’s straight — it’s ideal for ‘

Rollerblades,” Jesz said-.

The Eliza Furnace Trail, sometimes

known as the"ﬁail trail,” is a single lane rib-
bon of asphalt that splits the Parkway East
and Second Avenue. The trail begins at the
lower end of Greenﬁeld, and runs to an
access point Downtown near the Allegheny
County Jail. ,
The multi-purpose nail, completed in

1998, features a ﬂat asphalt surface, which '

became popular quickly with in-line
skaters and cyclists. Rurmers also use the

padded gravel paths that lie on each side of
the blacktop. _

Named for the famous Jones and
Laughlin Steel Company blast furnace that

occupied the ' Monongahela river bank A

along Second Avenue from 1958 to 1979,

the Eliza Fumace Trail is part celebration of

the city’sjindust1ial past and pan wise use of
available space for the  _ .
It is also one stretch of the Three

I Rivers Heritage Trail System, which could
eventually link’ many city‘ neighborhoods .

together. -
“It’s-nice to have things like that in the
city,” Chris Keller said. A ‘

Keller, 22, works in Oakland and uses T 
« the trail frequently for Rollerblading. ;
According to Keller, the “jail trail” is one of 

few places you can strap on your skates,
and the trailis well maintained.

The Eliza Furnace Trail is a little more
than a mile from Pitfs campus. To ﬁnd the

, access point, follow Bates Street to the bot-

tom and make a left on ‘Second Avenue.
Trail ‘access is just past the Hot Metal
Bridge on the left side. Prominent signs will
point the way.

conc

program for athletes

ERIN LINDEMAN

Staff Writer

. The jPitt,Panthers football team

willsoonibeglin to reap the benefits‘

of a state-of-the—art Sports Medicine
Concussion Program at UPMC in the
South Side. I N

The program -employs standard-

N ized computer tests to tell athletes if
' they are ready to continue playing

the game without risk of further head
injury.
a" The ' Steeler-s are already using

_ the concussion program,‘ and Pitt

 athletes will begin using it in the
' spring, according to._Rob Blanc, the
I Panthers’ head athletic trainer.

.Pit.t football player Dustin

 V Picciotti has suffered through. the”
3 [preseason with a" reoccurrence’ of.-
S ~:  head injury symptoms.’

“The program would have

  

. -1h<:>11>.ed,us.knew-»Wh¢n..[1?icci9tti1was-.1
‘ ""‘re‘ady to"play""’again:"""Blane said.

“We would have had a measurement
of when it was safe for him to return
to practice.”

Instead, Picciotti was out" of

practice for 2 1/2 weeks with recur-
ring dizziness and headaches, and
returned on Tuesday. '
I Blanc said that determining
when a player who has suffered a
concussion can return to practice is a
“guessing game” without any aid.

“It’s always in the back of my
mind, ‘Is it a bit too early?_’’’ Blanc
said.’

A major part of the program “is
the Immediate Post-Concussion
Assessment and Cognitive Testing

' system.

First, the athletes must take a 20-
minute computerized test that mea-
sures brain processing, speed," mem-
ory and visual motor skills.

Then, when.an athlete suffersﬁa
concussion during the season, he or
she is retested and the.pos.t—concus-
sion data is compared to the “nor—
mal” data.

This helps to determine when it
is safe for the player to return to
active sports. _

Dr. Mark Lovell, a'national1y-
renowned . sports‘ concussion
researcher, has been named -director
of the concussion program. He also
oversees

“Nothing like this program

exists‘ anywhere else in the country,”

said Dr. Charles Burke, another
nationally known sports concussion

expert- Burke sis. ..a1(s.o,_.an, assistant

professor of ' oirthoipédici surgery at
Pitt, as well as the founder and
director of the National Hockey
League Concussion Program and
current president of the NHL Team
Physician Society.

Dr. Joseph Marron, a professor
and a vice chairman or neurosurgery
at Pitt’s School of Medicine and

team neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh,

Steelers, said thatnearly 10 percent
of athletes involved in contact sports

suffer concussions‘. Marron said co‘n- _j
cussions are the most frequent injury“

among those athletes.

Directors also hope to extend the
program to high school athletes in
the area. I

ASA ushers in new term with skits and plans

KATIE BATTISTA

 

The Pitt News

The Asian Student Association is
rhyming anddancing its way into a
new semester, with the board mem-
bers’ interpretation of Saturday Night
Live’s cheerleader skit, ‘‘Roll Call.’’

ASA started off the fall semester
at its first meeting Thursday night by
introducing new board members and
fresh goals.

“We want to get more members
involved,” secretary Julio Puth said
ASA’s main goal this semester. “We
are trying to get more support from
within, not just from the members of

the board.”
Margarita. Sarmiento, ASA’s
president, hopes for more member

involvement in the various commit-

tees within the organization.
Members have the opportunity to
participate in political action, com-
munity service, fund-raising, public
relations, or current events commit-
tees. .

Junior member Marie Salle,
hopes that having former ASA
President Shahrooz Bhopti on this
year’s Student Government Board
will give the organization more rep-
resentation on campus.

ASA is also promoting other
campus organizations this year. In

addition to signing up for Pitt

Pathfinders, members A were also
encouraged to join “Speaking
Partners,” a language ,program

designed to help teach English to for-
eign students. '

Some of this semester’s board
members show promise in improving
ASA in other ways.

At the meeting, both new and old
members participated in a series of
silly, but fun icebreakers that had
everyone mingling, dancing and
singing, “row, row, row your boat.”

The games. were lead by‘ the new
social chair, Victor Damien.

“Victor is a very passionate per-
son, and he adds to the energy that

ASA has always had. He inspires oth-
ers to be proud of the organization
that they are a part of,” Salle said.
On- Thursday night the ASA
board also announced its decision to
sponsor Julio Puth’s campaign for
homecoming king. ,
ASA will continue to participate
in Pitt’s Cultural Fair and the East
Coast Asian Students Union’s annual
conference. They will also hold their
usual events including parties and
workshops that address issues such
as cultural identity and race relations.
Students who are interested in
ASA should look for ﬂyers, log onto
www.pitt.edu/asians or e-mail the
organization at asians@pitt.edu.

Crime Tip

The Pitt police were informed of
a possible credit card scam that is
taking place on Pitt’s campus‘.
Reports have been made that an indi-
vidual is soliciting students outside‘
the William Pitt Union. The credit
cards supposedly carry no fee or
obligation, and the solicitor tells stu-
dents that the card will not be acti-
vated when it is received. However,
when students receive the cards they
“are already activated.

The Pitt police urge students,
faculty and staff to use caution when
signing up for credit cards, and to
report any suspicious individuals
immediately. ‘ ’

after this. the
new york times V
will be a piece

detours, and I’m always late for
class,” he said. . “

Working to remedy the situa-
tion, Mark Brochetti, a construc-
tion worker on the site, said the
handicapped entrance and walkway
should be completed within a
week.

Pitt’s focus is on completing
this phase of the project.

“It’s coming along, and we’re
waiting on some more stones,”
Brochetti said.

According to Joseph Fink,
director of administration of facili-
ties management, the sandstone

tiles are replaced in stages and sec-
tions as the sandstone deteriorates.

It’s an ongoing issue, but this
year, the University is trying a new
approach to replacing tiles.

Rather than lay the tiles direct-
ly onto the ground, workers pour a
cement pad that provides a solid
foundation for the sandstone.

“It is very expensive to main-
tain the walkways and sandstone
— this is a much better solution,”
Fink said.

The Cathedral, built in 1926,
was the University’s solution to the
critical shortage of classroom

space after World War I. r _ ‘

The stately building’s purpos
was to impress Pittsburgh visitors.

The architecture conveys the idea
that education was the conse-
quence of reaching up to vast, new
heights.

In keeping with the Gothic
form and the original materials,

sandstone is the only material the

University uses to-replace the tiles.
“The. Cathedral is in the
Historic District, so we have to

leave it looking like the original,”

Service said.

Historically authentic for the
most part, the Cathedral requires
thousands of dollars per year for
maintenance. 0

tions to heating, ‘wiring, elevators
and plumbing.

the endurance race.

Ron Josefczyk drove the car in
the autocross race, where the car
takes one lap around the course. He
finished in 15th place with 56 sec-
onds. H .

Due to the restrictions placed

‘FROM PAGE 1

on the specifications of the car; the ~

team spends much more time work-
ing on the vehicle than driving it.

The competition’s restrictions
“help to promote engineering rather
than just going out there and mak-
ing a monstrous motor,” said
Josefczyk, who is also the team’s
engine and electrical components
supervisor.

The Honda 4-cycle, 4-cylinder
motorcycle engine must be custom
outfitted with almost every part,
including the framework itself.
Fuel for the machine, 100 octane
unleaded gasoline, is specially pur-
chased for racing events.

Each year the team starts out
with a new motor and then builds
the rest of the car. The previous
year’s car is used as a guinea pig to
test new. parts before they are
placed on the new model. The team
can spend up to $30,000 on its car,
but with a limited budget. Last

T year’s team spent only $12,000.

“For as little as we spent mone-
tarily, this car ran exceptionally

well,” Tone said. Tone also stated ‘

that it was one of the least expen-

sive cars at the international event. -

The team has several sponsors out-

side ofithe University who help\

them obtain custom parts.
“The car is extremely fun to

drive,” said co-captain Tone. “It’s
like nothing on the road.” With a 0-
60 mph time of less than four sec-
onds that’s not hard to believe.

EDITORIAL  

  Nothing is

ever free,

not even T-shirts

So far this semester, anyone
walking along the ‘Fifth Avenue
side of ' William Pitt Union may
have noticed the increasingly
mall—like appearance of the area,
as solicitors have been‘ gathering.
every day to prey on unsuspecting
college students with the lure of
free goodies. -

But everyone must remember:
nothing is free. Although a free T-
shirt may seem like a nice thing —
after all, college students tend to
have a low clothing budget —— we
must all remember that we’ll pay
for that shirt in one way or anoth-
er, whether it be via a high interest
rate on a credit card or a massive
cellular phone bill.

Besides, if the vendors are
giving out something in exchange
for someone merely filling out a
piece of paper, how good could it
be anyway? - Either it’s worth
almost nothing or, as said before,
they regain that money somehow.
If you still have the desire for
something free, the University
gives out free things all the time,
such as T—shirts before football and
basketball games. Also, right ‘now
there are many a freebie to be
found at the Sports Illustrated

through this afternoon by the
William Pitt Union.

Also, everyone out there hark-
ing their wares is not entirely cred-
ible; some vendors have even gone
as far as offering false promises
for credit cards. Also, some do not
even have permits from the
University to be there. Although

' this may be a daunting task, Pitt
police need to enforce these per-

nuts.

College students do hover
toward freebies, and the vendors in
front of the Union can be a great
way to get them. But it has become
too much.

Here’s a suggestion: maybe
the University should set aside

certain times on certain days for a ,

marketplace, where vendors
(approved by the University of
course, to weed out scams) can tap

the valuable college student mar- -

ket. Hold it between Hillman
Library and Posvar Hall; it worked
for the Activities Fair. Plus, any
student could visit that place, as it
should be well-advertised.
Meanwhile, the rest of us will not
be hassled as we walk to class
each day. Other universities
already do this, and it could work

Dispelling the myths of diabetes

During high school, when I pictured going to
college, I foresaw some of the possible problems.
I imagined I would have to get used to sharing a
room With a stranger. I assumed that I would
spend more time studying than before. I pondered
the difficulties of showering in stalls and‘ even
thought about how difficult explaining my
bizarre taste _ for obscure music would be.
However, I have my high school friends so bro-
ken in that I completely forgot about explaining
diabetes.

I have been a diabetic since
third grade; understanding blood
sugar and insulin dosages has
become second nature. But people
without ﬁrsthand knowledge of
diabetes have their heads ﬁlled with misconcep-
tions taught to them by healﬂt teachers and Stacey
from “The Baby—Sitters Club.” As a well-educat-
ed and healthy diabetic, I feel a duty to dispel the
myths and set Pitt students straight on this topic.

I’ll begin with the basics. Diabetes is a dis-

’ case that occurs when the immune system, for

unknown reasons, ‘attacks the beta—cells on the
pancreas, causing them to stop making 
Still with me? Good. Insulin brings glucose
ﬁom the bloodstream into the cells. In other
words, without insulin, a person could eat forev-
er and never get any nourishment. Diabetics sim-
ply lack  . T j ’
No problem, right? A- ° 'c can just inject
some insulin and be ﬁne. Wrong! The problem is

that human bodies have a natural level of sugar '

(glucose) in their blood at all times. A diabetic
must artiﬁcially maintain that same amount of
sugar by balancing the amount of food eaten, the
amount of insulin injected .and the amount of
exercise done.

Too much insulin, too much exercise or. not
enough food can cause low blood sugar. Just the

same, too little insulin, not enough exercise or too I

much food can cause high blood sugar.
Okay, now onto the important stuff. No mat-
ter what anyone toldyou, diabetics can indeed eat

' sugar. In fact, diabetics can eat anything that any-

one else can cat.
As long as I inject the correct amount of
 to counter‘ what I eat, I could live entirely

off of doughnuts if so desired. Of course, that’s—

not healthy for me, or anyone else for that matter,
but itis my decision to eat whatl want just as it is
your decision to eat what you want. Please, please
do not ask me or another diabetic if I am allowed
to eat something, because the answer will always
be yes.

drink alcohol. This question is more complicated.

' Some ‘diabetics get high blood sugar when they

nﬂEussA

drink, others get low blood sugar.
While neither are healthy, it is much
more dangerous to have low blood
sugar. And if a person is drunk, it can

, sugar is low.

For the type whose blood sugar level
decreases when drinking, my personal recom-
mendation, and I believe my doctor would agree
with this, wouldbetonotdrink r .

However, for the diabetic whose blood sugar

level increases, I think it’s acceptable to drink ‘ ‘ I

sometimesfas long as’ he or she stays sober
enough to be able to test his or her blood sugar
and still be able to draw up and inject a shot.

Although it is not healthy for a diabetic to drink 4

often, it’s okay to drink occasionally. , V
If you know someone who is a diabetic,
don’t give uninvited advice about food,,and don’t
assume that he doesn’t know what he’s doing.
Don’t be surprised when he whips out a syringe
or starts prinking his ﬁnger, and odor to help if he

says his blood sugar is low. Low blood sugar can '

be treated with juice or any other food that is
quickly absorbed into the blood stream. ‘

1 It really is not that big of a deal to have dia-
betes, as long as the diabetic stays healthy and
informed, and that  is not very difﬁcult

Diabetes is not exactly a day on the beach, but ‘
staying healthy is doable. I’m healthy, and I get ;

annoyed when non-diabetics become preachy. A

_ rule of thumb about diabetes, as well as with just

about anything, is that a little knowledge can be a

dangerous thing. Don’t pretend  you under-.
stand, and please don’t be afraid to ask questions. .

that she dnd other diabetics lead nomzal lives.

Advice: don’t drink yourself into a hospital bed

' Maybe you’ve had the unfortunate
experience of waking up somewhere and
wondering how you got there. If so, you
probably had too much to drink the night
before. _

On Friday morning, I woke up in a hos-
pital and wondered how I had gotten_there.
Please, do not try this at home.

Thursday evening started off innocently
enough. I was having a few drinks in my
house with two very attractive young ladies
from Duquesne. Alright, so maybe it’s not so
innocent, but I certainly wasn’t planning to
wake up the next day with an IV in my arm.

I should explain that I have a problem
common to many drinkers: once I get drunk,
I know no limits. After I had become thor-
oughly intoxicated, I began drinking like I
was a rugby player. The ladies left because
they had class the next morning, and I con-
tinued drinking because I am an idiot.

I sat on my ﬁont porch talking with my
rniddle—aged neighbors as I ingested almost
a ha]f—gallon of vodka. I remember thinking
that I should walk around Oaldand in search

i of a party. However, my memory ends there.

I can vaguely recall telling a paramedic
later that night that I had been drinking

vodka and peach schnapps. I remember

answering unending questions about my dis-
position at the time, and I remember puking.

I woke up just after 6 a.m. with an IV in
my left arm and what I think were electrodes
taped to my chest. The nurse thanked me for

being a “nice drunk,” handed me a patient »

discharge sheet and sent me on my way.

' Oh, and I got a T—shirt; apparently the
one I had been wearing was covered in
vomit. So, in perhaps the one good thing that
came from my hospitalization, I’ve ﬁnally
found an alternative to ﬁlling out those

V pesky credit card applications!

V Then I walked home. Fortunately, I had
completely neglected to lock or even close
my front door the night before, because I had

neither keys nor a wallet when I left the hos- _
- pital. I wasn’t actually wearing underwear

either, but that’s not something I care to
explain in this particular column.

I spent most of my Friday in bed, think-
ing about my night in the ER and trying to
ﬁgure out exactly how I ended up there.

~ Normally I would suppose that I had an

I unfortunate encounter with a city or campus

polieexofﬁcer. A 200—pound college student
stumbling through the streets of Oakland by
himself, probably saying hello to everyone
he meets and possibly engaging in unlawful
amounts of public urination, tends to draw
attention from the law. However, if a police-
man did confront me, he was certainly good-
hearted, because as far as I know I was not
arrested or cited for "underage drinking.

And because I do remember riding in
an ambulance, I can rule out the possibility
that I walked into the hospital and asked for
‘a complimentary Breathalyzer test.

So my best hypothesis is that my walk
into Oaldand went something like this:
because I was drinking out of a cup the size
of a bucket, and because that cup is now

‘ , missing from my house, I suspect ﬂrat I was

not only walking the streets drunk but carry— -
ing and drinking alcohol as I traveled.

I’m fairly sure I didn’t ﬁnd a party,
because I doubt the paramedics would have
found me inside a house. My

I imagine that either a concerned passer-

had little luck, and in true Good Samaritan
style called an ambulance.

The nurse was extremely nice, and of course‘ /

there was the free T—shirt. However, it has
come to my attention that we don’t live in a
socialist society, and I will surely be receiv-
ing a bill for my stay at the hospital. Worse

yet, I believe my insurance company will be
footing a large part of that bill, which means

that mommy dearest will undoubtedly catch '

If you do drink, I strongly advise you to
avoid drinking so much that you wake up in’
the hospital. Try to be a little more responsi-
ble than me, and your college career will be
hospital—free. Drinking can certainly be fun,
but the amount of drinking I did Thursday
evening deﬁnitely was not.

The additional instructions listed on my

drink so much alcohol!” I think that’s an
excellent diagnosis. I

CHRIS DINARDO
The Pitt News

, Nestled between student housing and
the Oakland post ofﬁce, the Young Navy

' Thrift Store, where brand—name clothes are

sold for well under $10, is just waiting for
shoppers. '

Rich Engel, owner of Young Navy,
said that he was aware of his bad timing
when he opened the store on the same week

V as Pitt’s ﬁnals last spring. But he didn’t

have much of a choice since the storewas
being renovated during that semester.
Summer was not any kinder; as fewer peo-
ple carne by to browseand sales did not

The third eseasonis the" charm, and

C ' hopefully this fall, students will take notice.

Barefoot and sprawled out on a chair
behind the counter, dressed in a plaid shirt

9; and jeans, Engel, a computer software

tester, always wanted to open a store where
he could hang out and chat with the locals,
' and in between sell something.

Even with a relaxed demeanor, 31-
year-old Engel isn’t sitting around waiting
for customers to crowd in like they’re at the
Gap. He’s already posted a few ads, and
even threw a fashion show last Saturday,
where a crowd outside watched the models

through the windows. The store“ is also
open late, until 8 p.rn. on weekdays and
until 6 p.m. on weekends to
accommodate late—rising
students and beat out
local clothing store
competition.

‘ Young Navy
beneﬁts Pitt students .
with financial strug— -
gles, not only appealing to ’ ,
them in cost, but also in style.
From Levi’s to Abercrombie and Fitch, a
wide selection of pants, shirts and shoes are
available at Young Navy, and most are only
two seasons old. a

Accessories are available for women,
including scarves, necklaces and purses.
No socks or underwear, though ——- students
are on their own for those purchases.

A spoof on Old Navy, Young Navy
wasn’t Engel’s -ﬁrst choice for a name. He
wanted to call his store SmartypPants, a
name that he said is more suitable for a
business that sells fashionable clothes at

smart prices, but it was taken by another '

store in Pennsylvania Engel doesn’t con-
sider Young Navy a vintage clothing shop,

well.

“This place is ‘best of the Goodwill,’'’’

he said.

Not an expert, but more of an admirer A

of second-hand clothes, Engel searches for

speciﬁc looks by rummaging through the
racks of the Goodwill and Salvation Army

' stores. Even though the clothes are used,

Engel is careful with his selections.

‘No one will ﬁnd clothesiwith stains
on them,” he said.

All the wearable merchandise is
"cleaned, and pants and shirts are ironed.

Students can also make some fast cash
by selling their neglected clothes to Engel.

s Clothes also can be traded in for credit.

If students don’t purchase anything,
they will at least leave having been enter-
tained by the obscure surroundings of
Young Navy. A “Shoplifters will be execut-
ed” sign written in crayon is posted oppo-
site the entranceway next to other frantic-

looking drawings on the walls.
The most unusual decoration is the

‘naked, blond—hairedpbaby dolls placed on

the shelves throughout the store, cheering
the customers on like mascots. And if the
“Magic the Do ” marketing ploy worked
for Old Navy, maybe Engel is on to some-
thing with baby dolls.

For now, Engel continues his profes-
sion in computer technology, dabbling part-
time as college—friendly thrift store owner
and waiting for the day when hanging out
will be enough to cover his ﬁnances.

Through the cracks

The Slip

Saturday
Beehive, 9 p.m.

STEPHANIE TYREE

The Pitt News

A large void is appearing where a once rela-
tively popular genre, improvisational instrumental,
used to be in mainstream American music today. It
has been removed, largely, by the increasing inter-
est in electronica and-the progres-
sive forms of rock and rap.

Yet, with their
sophomore effort,
Does, the Boston— A
based band The Slip
seeks to tackle this
void, invading it with _
their own intensely per-
sonal form of freedom jazz.

 
  
  
  

The trio, brothers Andrew and Brad Barr, on .

percussion and guitars, respectively, and bassist
Marc Friedman first collaborated during their high
school years in the early ‘90s, and later attended
the Berklee College of Music in Boston together.
This endeavor lasted a little more than a year, and
as the three began to test the local music scene,
they found it increasingly appreciative.

After creating a large,’ stable fan base in the
New England area, The Slip began traveling all
over the country, filling a variety of rooms. In
1997 they released their first album, From the

Gecko, after
signing to
Flying Frog
Records, the
young label
headed by

Allman Brothers
Band member
Butch Trucks.
Now, with the
release of their
second LP, the
trio ‘seeks to
showcase their
talent as vocal-
ists, songwrit-
ers,‘ and innova-
tive musicians.

As the name
indicates, the
band slips
through a wide
range of musi-
cal styles in the
14 songs com-
prising Does. The 3’
album alternates between up—tempo songs, show-
casing much of the talent of the drummer and gui-
tarist, and slower, almost lilting songs that have
more emphasis on. the impressive bass work of
Friedman.

The major low point of.the album is the vocals,
provided by Friedman and Brad Barr. The basic
problem with these pieces is simply that neither
musicians are singers —- they’re musicians. Also,
the instrumentation ‘ is decreased to a simpler,
almost poppy sound that clashes with the instru-
mentals

GRAPHIC BY MICHELLE JOSE/GRAPHICS ASSISTANT

The most interesting song of the entire album,
especially for those listeners interested in percus—.
sion, is “Paint Cans.” Played by the brothers Barr,
this traditional Ghanian piece adds a world music

i ﬂair to the albumthat is also slightly witnessed in

“Catacea,” “A Crack in the Sundial” and “Tohu
Bohu.”

Overall, the album is an impressive piece of
work that will appeal to the musical innovator and
listener. Yet, one can only hope that, when The Slip
come to Pittsburgh, they pay more attention to the
paint cans and less to the microphones.

Are you ready for

Wow, I never thought I would be
back in Pittsburgh already. Two weeks
ago I was catching catﬁsh and going to
Cincinnati Reds games and now I’m
here.

It’s strange suddenly adjusting
adjust back to student life but I am
managing. The thing that still throws
me off at this time of year is the start of
football season. Call me old—fashioned,
but it has to be cold outside to‘ play
football.

It usually takes until about October
to get fully ﬁred up about the great
game of football. But after almost
freezing to "death Tuesday night I’m
ﬁred up now.

Last season was a great year for
football. It reminded us of the fact that
it is still possible for the underdog to
win. Never in my wildest dreams
would have I picked the St. Louis Rams
to win over the Tennessee Titans in the
Super Bowl, or put Virginia Tech under
the guidance of Michael Vick, a red-
shirt freshman quarterback, in the
Sugar Bowl against Florida State. Even
more, the Hokies played the Seminoles
tough for three quarters of that game.

And this season should not be a
disappointment for gridiron fans either.
The Pitt squad is primed and ready to
kick ass and go bowling this December.

humiliating losses to Southern Cal and

‘ Harris said Tuesday at his weekly

press conference that he still is not
ready to choose between junior David
Priestley and senior John Turman,
who both showed promise against
Kent State on Saturday, but on an
inconsistent basis.

“Right now, I’m not to that point
yet to know that we’ve got one guy
that can -handle the excitement or the
compliment or the aura that goes to
being a starting quarterback,” Harris
said.

Harris added that the indecision
does not have an entirely negative

impact on the team; _

A “If we want to be the kind of foot-'
ball program that we are capable of T

being  then’ they’ve got to step up
and that’s why I’m trying to keep the
competition factor in there,” he said.
“Thisis the way that I think is best
for us to bring the best out of both

‘those two guys.” ‘

The Red Flash was quiet in the first
period but managed to get on the board

in the second.

most dangerous running backs in the nation, Lamont

Syracuse is traveling to the

The competition between
Priestley and Turman has existed
since the start of last season, but
Harris said that he has “raised the bar”
of his expectations for the two players.

“I felt more guilty a year ago play-
ing both quarterbacks because neither

‘ one had played,” he said. “The reason

why I felt guilty was because it was
hard for the team, because one guy
was getting half as many reps, but I
wasn’t positive about who the guys
were.”

Harris reiterated his stance that
the depth of Pitt’s receiving corps is
one of the most dominating in the

nation. ,

“I’m excited. about Wide Receiver
U.,” he said.
R.J. English and Lamar Slade both

if asserted themselves against Kent

State, and Harris took note of the two
standouts.

“You couldn’t ask anything more
of R.J. English or Lamar,” Harris said.
“Both of them showed that they are
football players.”

To,add to the depth, Harris ‘said

. that Rod Rutherford, who entered

training camp strictly as a quarter-
back, will play wide reciever _in spots.

Wideout Antonio Bryant will also
play Saturday. Bryant, along with
Rutherford and three other Panthers,

‘K are coming off of a one-game suspen-

sion for disciplinary reasons stem-

tem. A
The running game was a pleasant
surprise on Saturday, led by Kevan
Barlow, who has moved from Harris’
doghouse in the spring of 1999 to a
leadership position in 2000.0
“Whatwas also very helpful was
that he a couple nice breaks in

I between with the lightning,” Harris

said. “Normally, I know We would

have played Nick Goings quite a bit ’

more.”

On the other side ‘of the -‘ball,
Harris praised the defense, which has
not received much attention in the
media thus far.

“Obviously we’re not ready for ‘
—‘ the Hall of Fame by any stretch of the.
imagination, but we sure did a nice

solid account for ourselves,” he said.
While he was, on the‘ whole, com-
plimentary his players, ‘Harris empha-
sized that the team needed to get out
on the practice fields at the UPMC
Sports Performance Complex and get

, some work done.

“We talked to our football team
about the improvement that good foot-

 ball teams make from game one to
' game two, [which] is the largest in the

season,” hesaid. “So, we’re hoping to

see that.”

0 Though Harris would prefer it
otherwise, he said that he thinks his
players are looking forward to the
Penn State game Sept. 16.

“Unfortunately, I think that we’re
still a young football team so I would
guess that’s a natural tendency,” he
said. '

He added that its the responsibili-

ty of the coaching staff to , impress
upon the team that the Bowling Green
game is very important.

“This is a big game for us, and
that’s not just empty words,” he said.

goal tries and three extra points

against Kent on Saturday. He was also

two-game suspension. Sophomore
Robb Butler, a reserve comerback, has
been practicing at free safety this
week. .

0 Harris said that in order to play a
game against a

Conference team, Pitt had to agree to
play one game as the visitor.
“Nowadays, because they have a

Mid-American _

lot of people interested in playing
them, you have to agree to one at
home, unless you pay them major
league bucks. Which, I guess, we’re
not doing quite yet,” Harris said.

The Panthers hosted Bowling
Green last season, and Pitt will play
Bowling Green again at home in 2006.

0 Harris was pleased with the
progress of Brandon Williams, who
moved from running back to strong
safety in the spring, and then moved to
linebacker in the fall. Williams had
seven tackles and a pass breakup, and
for his efforts, he was named defen-
sive player of the game by the coach-
ing staff.

“We thought Brandon Williams
really stood out,” he said. “He really
did ﬂy all over the ﬁeld and made
some plays for us.”
