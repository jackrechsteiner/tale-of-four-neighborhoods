2B|ue“and Gold awarded

The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s Blue
and Gold Society gained international
recognition earlier this month when it

was presented with the “Outstanding ,

Organization Award” from the Council
for the Advancement and Support of
Education.

Blue and Gold, a group of students
who serve as ambassadors and represen-
tatives for the University, was honored
at the CASE 2000 Association of
Student _ Advanﬁent Programs
International Assenﬂﬁy in Phoenix on
Sept.12. _ '

Accepting on the society’s behalf
was Blue and Gold advisor Mary Jean
Lovett and president Jennifer Smith.
They were presented with the honor in
front of almost 400 international schools
at the awards banquet in Phoenix.

“We were so proud to win this
award, we’ve worked so hard and the
kids have served as wonderful ambas-
sadors for the University,” Lovett said.

To become eligible for the yearly
award, the society submitted a Power
Point presentation to CASE that served
as a training guide for other student
alumni organizations. Due to their suc-
cess at the assembly, their tape will be

 

PAR Kl N G

on the Lower scarnpuis

distributed nationwide to such societies.

However, being honored by CASE
is not unfamiliar territory for Blue and
Gold. Earlier this year the society won
the “Outstanding Organization Award”
for its district, and in 1992 it was award-
ed the “Outstanding Advisor Award.”

According to Lovett, the Blue and
Gold Society’s involvement in commu-
nity and campus projects, as well as
their ability to relate to the student body,
allowed them to stand out over the other
300 organizations competing for the
award. 1 ‘

Projects that the society has taken
part in range from Big Brothers and Big
Sisters to a neighborhood cleanup
effort. Members have alsoserved as rep-
resentatives for visits by the President of
Ghana, the prime _ minister of
Luxembourg, former President George
Bush, Attorney General Janet Reno and
Gov. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., and former
Gov. Dick Thomburgh, R-Pa.

The Blue and Gold Society was
established in 1991 in order to allow
select undergraduate students the oppor-

_ tunity to serve as ambassadors for the

University. Ambassadors represent the
student body and the Pitt Alumni
Association at University and alumni
functions and seek to promote a positive
image ‘of the University and its student
body. V T A

Jumpstart offers volunteer
opportunities to students

PAVANA BHAT

Staff Writer

College is known traditionally as a
time for students to focus on themselves,
but for Liz Louik, the best times she had in
college were not when she focused on her-
self, but when she gave back to the city of

' Boston.

Louik found a “broader view” when

she started participating in the Americorps

program, Jumpstart. j V _ P‘

Louik said the program gave her the
opportunity to do something for commu-
nities she would'“never have seen if [she]
had just stayed_on campus.” q

She is now a Jumpstart program direc-.
tor at Pitt, and she looks back on the time
she spent teaching and mentoring Boston
children as “one of the best parts of col-
lege.’’

In 1993, two college students from
Yale spent the summer working with chil-
dren at a camp. Inspired by their experi-
ence, they created the Jumpstart program
to educate needy children. , ' .

Americorps member Patrick Noll is

. an Americorps Vista member. The Vista
9 program focuses on supervision, recruit-
rnent and member organization. He
described’ how Jumpstart was a part’ of the.

Americorps services.M“Americorps has
service in the areas of human needs, envi-
ronment, public safety, health and educa-
tion,” he said. “Jumpstart is one of the edu-

cational programs and is one of the newest;
. chapters in Americorps.”

Jumpsta'rt requires its student volun-
teers to commit to two years of service.
This includes a summer of 400 hours of
intensive training, when Americorps

_ members teach an entire classroom of chil-

dren. . » V ’
Americorps ﬁrst awarded Jurnpstart
with a grant in 1996. This ‘grant ﬁmded
“educational awards,” which are awarded
to volunteers after they have completed
their two-year“ service commitments. Most
students use ﬂiese awards to repay loans or
to put toward future tuition bills.
Throughout the school year, the mem-

bers are paired one-on-one with children, '_ '
‘and serve eight to 10 hours per week. In * ‘

total, the two-year commitment is equal to
900 hours. — _ ~ 1 ‘
Many students who are interested in
education participate in Jumpstart, but
Louik said that the program is not exclu-
sive to education majors.
“We have business majors, ﬁlm

majors, bio, and marketing majors, as well '

coming into the factory.

“Workers have been struggling

with [Chentex management} for

years, and working all the time.
They have no voice, and that’s why
we’re here,” she said. 4

John Lacny, a senior member of
Students in Solidarity, has been a
member of the group since its incep-
tion in 1997. i "

_“We want people to know that
hundreds of workers have been fired
and the’ terrible way they are forced
to work and raise their families.” He
also said that “bogus” criminal
charges have-been brought against
11 union leaders who could each
face up to seven years in jail.

The protest outside Kohl’s -lasted
just nine minutes while a‘ delegate
spoke to the management of the
store.

When asked about the brevity of

the protest, Robin Alexander of
United Electrical Workers said, “I
think it was very effective. The man-
ager was relatively cordial. We
wanted to send a message to upper
management that '

testersregrouped at the office ‘of
Hart to voice their opinions about
her workers’ rights voting record.
Members of SEIU protested Hart’s
opposition -to raising the minimum
wage, as well as her anti—union Vot-
ing habits. .- .

Both protests were held without ,

police interference.‘
“You have to plan ahead if

you’re going to get arrested,” Lacny '
said. “Many court cases have been‘

lost, and that. wasn’t the ‘point of
today.”

The manager of the Kohl’s store ’

in Cranberry said ‘she would pass
along the grievances of the group to
upper management of the store, and
the protesters believe that their cause

was helped by their actions. They‘

will also be protesting ' another
Kohl’s department‘ store next month.

EDITORIAL  

Pedestrian fines will ultimately
benefit walkers and drivers

City police have a lot on their
hands. There are plenty of bad guys to
catch — murderers to incarcerate,
thieves to halt in their tracks, drunk dri-
vers to get off the roads. And let’s not
forget pesky pedestrians who can’t
seem to ﬁgure out how to properly
cross a street.

From this perspective, taking
police action against pedestrians who
jaywalk or don’t otherwise obey traffic
signals appears utterly ridiculous. The
police, it seems, should have far more
important things to do with their time
and resources. I

But as Mayor Tom Murphy and
City Council have realized, traﬂic acci-
dents and delays caused by pedestrians
constituteserious business indeed. As
the city is preparing to begin work on
the Fifth—Forbes renewal plan and con-
struction on projects such as the Fort
Pitt Bridge ramps has forced more traf-
ﬁc Downtown, police have increased
ticketing of pedestrians who fail to
cross properly. Thankfully, due to a line
in the City Code uncovered Friday by
Chief City Magistrate William T.
Simmons, fees can be reduced from
$93.50 to $33.50 if appealed in Traﬂic
Court.

In choosing to enforce pedestrian
violations more heavily, the city’s
intentions are commendable. If more

people crossed at cmsswalks according
to the necessary signals, surely it would
be a step toward preserving safety and
lessening traﬂic. ‘

The city’s current attitude toward

enforcement seems appropriate.
Reducing the ﬁne of the violations
should aid in halting reckless crossing
without completely souring police-
pedestrian relations. In addition to the
tickets, according to Deputy Mayor Sal
Sirabella, city oﬂicials are also plan-
ning on taking more proactive mea-
sures, such as painting more cross-
walks signs in brilliant neon yellow-
green.

Furthermore, in an apparent dis-
play of leniency, Murphy. and the City
Council are considering the idea of
issuing warning tickets to pedestrians in
lieu of a fee for their ﬁrst violation.

The critical issue will be if police
continue to embrace a cooperative atti-
tude toward enforcement in the coming
months. A militant smack—down of
pedestrian hooligans might begin to
unnecessarily drain police resources
and cause even the most wholesome
street—crosser to tremble in paranoia.
But as long as police continue to main-
tain an appropriately lenientattitude,
the increased enforcement should

improve the city by fostering the well- .

being of pedestrians and drivers.

|ack|uster29-17 win over Rutgers

KAREN BIELAK

Staff Writer

Saturday’s football game against
Rutgers was supposed to be ugly. And it was,
but not quite in the way it was expected.

Pitt managed to come out victorious
against the Scarlet Knights, 29-17, despite

fumbling the ball ﬁve times and throwing.

two interceptions. The Panthers had been
favored by three touchdowns to easily defeat
this team which for the past few years has
been the doormat of Big East football.

But despite the sloppy play, Pitt head
coach Walt Harris was pleased with the team
and the win.

“We are going to be excited about any

victory,” Harris said. “It was not our kind of '

football, but we are tremendously excited”

Rutgers was unable to capitalize on its
ﬁrst possession of the game. The Panthers
took control of the ball and after the ﬁrst pass
from John Turman was incomplete, Pitt put
its nmning game to work

VVrth it 2nd and goal inside the 1 yard
line, Kevan Barlow carried the ball into the
end zone for his ﬁrst touchdown of the year;

After the extra point was kicked by Nick
Lotz, the Panthers took the early 7-0 lead.

Rutgers went three-and-out to give Pitt

the ball back. The Panthers. ﬂten started to

falter as Barlow fumbled the ball which was

recovered by Rutgers’ DeWayne Thompson.

Fortunately, the Panther defense contin-

. ued to play well, as ithas all season. The next

series for Rutgers -resulted in an interception ‘

of a Mike McMahon pass by’ Wlliarn
Ferguson, and the offense quickly had a
chance for redemption. 1

“Our defense was tough and stopped ,

them,” Harris said “It was similar to the

Penn State game in some ways because they 5

gave the offense chances.”

However, the offense continued to
make mistakes. A Turman pass that was
intended for wide receiver Antonio Bryan
was intercepted by Shahib White. ’

The defense was once again faced with
stopping the Scarlet Knights, but were
unabletodosoonthenextdrive. Rutgers put
together eight plays, /ﬁnished off by a 16-
yardpasstoErro1Jolmsonforthescore‘.

The Knights then kicked off, and the

Panthers quickly regained the lead when‘

Torrie Cox returned the kick 86 yards fora

Rutgers continued to be smothered by

the Pitt defense and on their next possession

Faced again with the 4th down a few
plays later, Lotz came on to attempt the 27-

went wide right. .

Men’s soccer tea

MATT MILOSZEWSKI

Staff Writer

The l4th—ranked Pitt men’s soccer
team had‘ a busy weekend hosting
Connecticut and. Seton Hall in a pair of
Big East Conference games.

The matchup with UConn pitted
the No. 4 Huskies against an undefeat-

ed Pitt squad, and UConn was able to
‘ pull out a 1-0 victory. But Pitt bounced

back yesterday to claim a 4-3 win over
the Pirates.

Connecticut 1, Pitt 0 .

Friday night,’ Pitt’s men’s soccer.

team had aspirations of knocking off
one of the premier soccer programs in
the land. However, No. 4 UConn had
other ideas, as they defeated the
Panthers 1-0 at Quaker Valley High
School. 9 6 ’ 9

The Panthers outplayed UConn for
most of the game, but with just two
minutes and 46 seconds remaining, the

tides changed. The lone goal of the '
game was scored when freshman for-

ward Cesar Cueller softly lifted a
crossing pass into the air and senior
defenseman Garrett Grinsfelder was
able to head it past sophomore" goalie
Justin Gaul.

Although the Panthers lost the
‘game, head coach Joe Luxbacher was
happy with his team’s performance.

“We played very hard,” Luxbacher
said."‘This was just a great game. I
mean, we had great chances to score,
but didn’t convert.”

While Pitt did not get on the score-

board, it did have several scoring
opportunities, the first of which
occurred early in the game.

Huskies defender Max Zieky was
called for a handball when the Panther
defense stepped up the pressure. This
resulted inta penalty kick for the

Panthers. Pitt elected to have redshirt p

sophomore Chris Churchill take the
kick. ' V
Churchill aimed for the lower left
side of the goal, but UConn goalkeep-
er Bryheem Hancock also guessed that
side. Hancock dove‘ and made a great

T save.

That was not the only scoring
chance the Panthers had on the play,
though. On the rebound of Churchill’s
shot, sophomore midfielder Bryan
Hopper quickly took a shot ‘of his own.
The shot got by Hancock, but hit the
goalpost. . ' '

' Saturday’s 29-17 win over Rutgers

that only two more wins are needed for
Pitt to become bowl-eligible. '

That’s a sad statement that shows
how easy it is to play in a postseason
bowl game in NCAA football.

There are currently 25 bowl games A
scheduled to be played at theend of the

season. That means 50 teams will have a
chance to play in a bowl game.

right if we’re going to play at a higher level
in our conference.” ,

A A_ Kevan Barlow fumble, one of two
for Barlow, was Pitt’s ﬁrst turnover of the
day. Although Rutgers got started out on
Pitt’s 40-yard line, it could not convert the
mistake into points, as quarterback Mike
McMahon was intercepted by V William
Ferguson at the 7-yard line. _

However, Rutgers, did capitalize on
Pitt’s second tumover, a John Turman inter-
ception that was returned 40 yards by
Shahib White to midﬁeld.

After a roughing the passer penalty,
McMahon hooked up with Errol Johnson
for a 16-yard: score to tie the game at 7. i

_ Pitt went into halftime with a 23-7 lead.
But before the half would end Priestley
threw a ball into triple coverage that was
intercepted by White, ruling out any chance
for Pitt to tack on extra points before the end
of the half. ‘

On the opening kickoff of the second
half, Pitt’s versatile ‘ slasher, Rod
Rutherford, returned the ball for 65 yards.
However, the return and nice drive were
annulled when Barlow coughed the ball up
on the Rutgers 8-yard line.

>“Things went well for a while,_ then all
of a sudden we were our own worst
enemy,” Harris said.

Rutgers kicker Steve Barone connect-
ed on a 22-yard ﬁeld goal to make it a 23-

turnovers. b

V On its very next possession Pitt went
three and out and was forced to punt.

FROM PAGE 10

Long snapper Kurt Johnson, a redshirt
freshman, high snapped a ball which Pitt
punter Jay Junko was unable to reach. The
ball soared into the end zone and Rutgers
safety Wes Lysack recovered it for a touch-
down.

23-17” game, with all 17 points coming off
of Pitt miscues,

‘Pitt’s 10th drive of the game resulted in 1

its third consecutive fumble, this time it was
a scrambling Rutherford who failed to pro-
teEt the ball. 1

Just as it did versus Penn State, Pitt’s
defense held up and bailed the offense out
throughout the game. Pitt’s defense silenced
Rutgers’ running gameas they were unable
to break into the red, accumulating 13
yards. _ A V
‘The defense stopped them, andkept
giving the offense chances,” Harris said.
“They got mad and turned it up.”

Pitt running back Nick Goings took.

over the duties for Barlow for the remainder
of the game. He ﬁnished with a career-high
110 yards on 23 carries.-'

After a fumble iby Schwenk on‘

Rutgers’ own 35-yard line, Goings and full-
back Lousaka Polite combined for 25 yards
to ice the game and give Pitt a 29-17 lead. .

“Frustration almost overcame us today.
We have to do a better job of maintaining
our poise,” Harris said. I 7
' _ Goings said,‘ ‘Maybe last year or the
year before we would ‘have found a Way to
lose it, but this year we found a way ‘to
Win ” . .

‘Although Pitt was able to get the victo— ‘ V

ry to move to 4-0, Hams noted that his team
has a lot to improve upon. 

 ' FROM PAGE 10

Rutgers again recovered, and on theensuing

A drive kicked a 22-yard ﬁeld goal to shorten

the Panther lead. = - -

VV1th Pitt set to punt, the snap sailed
over the head of punter Jay Junko and was
recovered by Rutgers in the end zone for a
touchdown. The extra point moved Rutgers
to within six, 23-17.

The Panthers could not hold onto the 7

ball, as Rutherford fumbled in the next series
to once again turn the ball over.

The next Panther possession resulted in
an all too familiar scene — a fumble, this time
by Bryant. 1 A

The Scarlet Knights then followed Pitt’s

_ lead and fumbled the ball, which was recov-

ered by Gonsales. On the ensuing posses-
sion, Polite ran the ball in for his ﬁrst career
touchdown. - _ --

Pitt was able to hold on for the ﬁnal
minutes of the game to seal the victory and
improve to 4-0 on the season and 1-0 in the

Big East. Rutgers fell to 2-2 and remained

winless in conference play at 0-2.

The defense held Rutgers to -13 rushing
yards, the lowest total since 1988” when the
team held Navy to a Tschool-record -33
yards.

The Panthers now have an off week to ._

address the problems and become more
focused. For now, Harris and the team are
happy to have escaped with the win.

 

“You have to give Rutgers  and
always give [head coach] Terry Shea credit.
They almost came away with a victory,”

, Harris said. “We have to realize there are '

bumps in the road and luckily we came out
with a win.”
