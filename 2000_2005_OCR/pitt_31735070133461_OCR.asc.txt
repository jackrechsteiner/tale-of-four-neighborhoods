Returning students need to know
that the new year isn’t just time for res-
olutions, it’s also time to reapply for
financial aid.

0 More than half of all Pennsylvania
students receive some form of ﬁnan-
cial aid, according to the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agency.
The United States Department of
Education‘ reports that this year, an

estimated $49.4 billion in federal fund-“

ing will be awarded to 8.2 million stu-
dents across the country for postsec-
ondary education.

“January marks not only the start
of a new year, but also the time to
begin the financial aid process,” said
Elinor Taylor, chair of PHEAA’s board
of directors, in a recent press release.
PHEAA, created in 1963 as an inde-
pendent non-profit public agency,
plays a big role in the financial aid
process.-

“If a student needs financial aid,
they absolutely must complete and
submit the [Free Application for

Federal Student Aid],” Taylor said."

“This year we’ve made this even easi-
er for students by providing online

federal government use the FAFSA to
determine a student’s eligibility for
various ﬁnancial aid programs.

The FAFSA must be submitted by
April 1. Renewal packages for the
FAFSA are automatically mailed out
after the first of the yearto returning
students who receive ﬁnancial aid. The
form can also be filled out online at

The Petersen Center has already
made an impact on the Pittbasketball
teams. According to men’s basketball
head coach Ben Howland, athletes are

wooed by the grandeur of the new A

facility and recruiting ‘haslbeen much
easier. , l

“I lost recruits because of the
Fitzgerald Field House,”'Howland

said.

The first words Knight heard three

‘years ago when former head coach

Ralph Willard recruited him to play
Pitt basketball were about the Petersen
Center being built where Pitt Stadium

“used to be.

Now Knight is a junior and led the

Panthers to a top 25 ranking and a 15-

1 record, but still hasn’t played in the
Petersen Center.

a “Coach Willard told ‘me the build-

ing would be ready by my junior year,_”

Knight said. “I wish we could play in

it now.” _

receive aid should have applications
automatically mailed to them.

There are many different types of ‘

financial aid available. from Pitt,
including scholarships, grants, loans
and work-study jobs.

Scholarships are gifts and do not
have to be repaid. Most scholarships
are merit based, but some can be
awarded on the basis of need. Outside
scholarships not awarded by Pitt can
also be applied to tuition costs.

_ Grants are another type of gift aid
that usually comes from federal or
state government funds or from Pitt
itself. Grants are usually based on
need. , »

Loans are the most common way
of paying for a postsecondary educa-

tion. Loans are need-based and must be

repaid after the student ﬁnishes school,
with interest added to the amount bor-
rowed. Loans are available through
many federal and state programs, as
well as through private lenders.
Work-study jobs provide assis-
tance through part-time employment.

The student ‘has the opportunity to —

work at various places on or off cam-
pus and receives a monthly paycheck
from the University. Pitt offers work-
study jobs in a variety of professional
fields, which can be a valuable experi-
ence for the student.

Students who reapply for financial
aid will receive an awards letter detail-
ing the amount and types of -aid they
have been awarded. ‘Unless there \has
been a dramatic change in the student’s
financial situation, mostaid packages
remain roughly the same from year to
year. ‘ ~

  PERSPECTIVES  

EDITORIAL . I ’

University must ensure Petersen
Events Center is student—friendly

Recently, students at Pitt have become
—— with reason +_— more excited about the
men’s basketball team. For the ﬁrst time
since 1998, it is ranked in the top 25. The
team is 15-1. Student season are tickets sold

out. The game against Notre Dame at the A
Fitzgerald Field House Saturday is com—'

pletely sold out as well.

’ Yesterday, the athletic department con-
ducted a tour of the new Petersen Events
Center, to be completed in time for the class
of 2002’s graduation ceremonies to be held
there on April 28 and the basketball teams
to play there during the 2002-2003 season.

But construction is already behind
schedule. Athletic director Steve Pederson
said it will “absolutely” be done in time for
graduation. The original goal was to have it
ready for this year’s basketball season, as
guard Brandin Knight said former coach

Ralph Viflllard told him it would be.

Perhaps the team’s current success would
be even more enjoyable in the new facility.

The class of 2002 anticipates graduat-
ing in the Pete. Iet’s hope graduating
seniors will not be disappointed either.

They opened their college careers with Pitt ‘
Stadium still there, and it would be only '

appropriate for them to close at the Events
Center. , ‘

While this new facility will be irnpres-
sive —— indeed, it will be a step up from the
old Field House —- there ‘is reason to be

concerned about its purpose, ,

Two years ago, the University tore
down Pitt Stadium and moved football
games off—campus_to the North Shore. This
happened despite student opposition. Now,
it appears the Events Center_has not been

designed entirely for students either. This

only further demonstrates that college
sports have become about one thing:
moneyf . .

The new facility will hold 15,000 peo-
ple for basketball games, but only 1,500 of
those seats‘ will be for students. So while
the Events Center will have more than
twice the capacity of the Field House, the
student section will only have 1,500 seats
——only one andahalftimesasmany asin
the Field House. '

Athletic director Steve Pederson said
that he hoped there would be a frenzy over
those l,500_ student seats. Why not simply
provide. students with enough seating to
watch. their own University’s’teams in the
first place? . '

The Events Center will have numerous
luxury suites, even courtside. But will stu-
dents ever see the inside of these? Not like-

ly. Instead, the suites will be revenue‘

machines for the athletic department.
The University needs to open more
seats to the students, keep those seats cheap

I and make sure they will forever  quality

seats.

A But let’s think back a moment to 1985, just
before most of us came of age.
At the beginning of 1985', Konstantin Chemenko

“served as leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist

Republics. President Ronald Reagan described that

’ country as the Evil Empire. Czechoslovakia was one

country and under communist rule. Germany was
two countries, one of them under communist rule.
Although the Soviet Union had weakened great-
ly, few in the West knew it. The Cold War seemed far
from over. Indeed, with the Reagan administration’s
proposed missile defense program and large-scale
military buildup, the Cold War appeared to be get-
ting hotter. But in March of that year, Chemenko
died and a new leader named Mikhail Gorbachev
took power. Although people knew Gorbachev
would be a reformer, almost no one could have pre-
dicted that he would be the last president of the
Soviet Union. _ ‘
In 1985, we supported groups that’ included
Islamic fundamentalists and a man named Osama bin
Laden in their fight against the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan. The occupation’s defeat was far from
certain. The Red Army had been there for six years
already, and no one knew how long it would remain.

Home for me is a small town
north of Pittsburgh; it’s quaint, safe
and generally deemed “a good place
to raise children.” Parents like it for
precisely this reason. Far from city ‘
lights, fast traffic and higher crime
rates, the people of my hometown
fall asleep with the doors to their
houses and cars unlocked.

After spending three weeks there
over winter break, I missed the city
and my regular choices of theaters,
events, parties and cool restaurants.

Pourquoi? .

Leslie Hoffman”

 

At home, my choices of enter— ,
tainment seem to be limited to the movie theater in the Wal-
Mart plaza, bowling or renting a movie with my friends.
Even though I may regularly just rent a movie with my city
friends or go bowling in Squirrel Hill, somehow simply liv-
ing in the city makes these mundane entertainment choices
more fun. Maybe the constant stimulation that comes with
urban living makes a night in front of the television more
enjoyable. _

But while home, I did have at least one special Saturday
night. _ ' . K '
One weekend while my parents were away, I was left
“in charge” at home. I had to see that my two sisters got to
the places they needed to go, and make sure that someone
was home for my youngest sister Bethany, who’s 13.

As Saturday night drew near, I was itching to get out of 1

the house. My 17-year-old sister Marta had already made
plans with her friends, leaving me to take care of Bethany. I
sadly foresaw for myself a lonely evening waiting in front of
the television for a phone call to pick her up. ‘ I

But then her plans changed. .-

“Leslie, do you want to go to a movie?” she asked.

We pondered going to dinner and a movie, but realized
we were too short on cash to do both. Finally, we decided to
get take-out and a video. -

We bundled up for the cold weather and climbed into
my dad’s old Mercedes for our trek to the closest sushi bar
~—- 25 minutes away. In the car, we traded off control of the
music, switching back and forth between ‘60s British pop
and Sum 41. We didn’t talk a lot and we didn’t fight overthe
music. ', 

At the sushi bar, we bargained with each other on how
many orders of sushi to get with fish vs. sushi without fish.

We climbed back into the sedan and drove the 25 min-
utes home, stopping to pick up a video on the way. We chose
“Heartbreakers,” a guilty title I had wanted to see but could"-
perfectone. _ ' _ .

After returning home, we set up our sushi in front of th

n’t without an excuse; my 13-year-old sister provided the

television and _ate_. as we watched Jennifer Love Hewitt and ,

Sigourney' Weaver seduce old, rich bastards.
Afterwards, we went out for ice cream.
There wasn’t anything wildly exciting about this night.
It wasn’t a crazy house party or an exotic restaurant (I guess
we did get sushi), but there was something special about it.
I shared it with good company.

Two of the teen movies released in the past month

— have different takes on the teen movie genre. “Teen

MTV movie features
MTV music

Orange County: The
Soundtrack
Various artists

Columbia Records
sﬁrvkik

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Staff Writer

The soundtrack to the movie “Orange
County” is odd. Most soundtracks have
either nothing or everything to
do with their movies, but this
soundtrack inhabits middle
ground.

For example, Prince’s soundtrack for
the ﬁrst “Batman” movie was excellent,
with songs from the movie that actually
had something to do with the movie. But
the soundtrack to ‘Batrnan and Robin” has
nothing at all to do with the movie and the
songs are uninspired. 4

The “Orange County” soundtrack!
departs from the “nothing or everything”
pattern, inhabiting a strange place where
few soundtracks exist. All the songs on the
soundtrack are in the movie, but not every
song has to do with the movie.

Listen

' The excellent tracks that compliment
the movie, including ones by Foo Fighters,
Social Distortion and Brian Wilson, could
easily stand on their own. When put with
the movie, though, they take on an added
dimension. ,

There are others, though, like “1st
Time” from Bad Ronald and “Stick "em
Up” from Quarashi that paint the movie as
something it’s not.

The movie is concemed with a high
school kid’s journey to realize that he does-
n’t need to get away from his eccentric
family to realize his dreams. But these
songs make the movie out to be about sex.
There is little sex in the movie and the
movie certainly isn’t centered on it. To
imply that the movie is about
losing your virginity, like
“1st Time” suggests, does
the movie a great injustice.

_ The only explanation for 'this is that
MTV, who produces the movie, thinks that
all teens embrace the “American Pie”
mentality so they should throw songs
about sex‘ in the mix. Or maybe MTV is
playing videos from these groups. Either
way, the songs hurt the soundtrack and the
movie.

Another big problem with the sound-
track is the inclusion of Crazy Town’s
“Butterﬂy.” It is in the movie, twice actu-
ally, and both times the song appears, the
movie grinds to a screeching halt. And so

does the soundtrack. The song has no place
in the movie and should not be included on
the soundtrack. There is a song by J immy
Eat World that is in the movie but not on
the soundtrack and should have replaced
the hugely overrated “Butterﬂy.”

With the exception of three tracks, the
soundtrack is a keeper. It could easily stand
alone as a compilation CD. There are some

songs, like Foo Fighters’ “The One” and
Phantom P1anet’s “California” that should
live on after the movie and soundtrack dis-
appear from the popular radar. The sound-
track is an excellent companion to
“Orange County.” As the liner notes sug-
gest, listening to the soundtrack after the
movie puts you in “the Orange County
state of mind.”

‘in the Bedroom’ more
promising than its
trailer

In the Bedroom
Starring Sissy Spacek, Tom

V Wilkinson, Nick Stahl, William

Mapother and Marisa Tomei
Directed by Todd Field
i‘n2n.“r1/2

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE
Staff Writer

First, a warning: if you’ve seen the
trailer for “In the Bedroom,” please
dismiss it. It doesn’t giveaway key
scenes or even the ending, but it
makes this remarkably intense little
ﬁlm look like a cheap domestic-dis-
pute-slash-psycho-stalks-family ﬂick.

And that it is not.

In fact, aside from being one of
the most intense films of the year, “In

the Bedroom” is the.most strikingly

human-level scenario the cinema pro-
ducednin 2001.

We’re shown early on that “the
bedroom” is a lobster trap that, when

more than one male lobster is trapped -

inside with an egg-laden female lob-
ster can become very lethal forthe
male lobsters. ‘

Next, cut to a family gathering
where young Frank Fowler (Nick
Stahl) has brought around I
his sweet and slightly older
new ﬂame Natalie (Marisa
Tomei). Parents Matt and
Ruth Fowler (Tom
Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek,,probable
Oscar noms) are a little worried, and
reasonably so. Natalie, with two chil-
dren, seems to be more than just
another ﬂing for Frank, which could
bring about every parent’s mini-night-
mare of their child ditching their col-
lege education.

On top of that, Natalie is techni-

cally still married —' the divorce has- .

n’t/ come through —.to the intimidat-
ing Richard Strout (William
Mapother), spoiled heir to the Strout
fish-packing empire.

"The opening’s focus on Frank is
one that could have easily made up an
entire film, following his struggle
between commitment to Natalie and
his future career, with Richard’s
obsessive behavior tipping the scales.
But the film then makes a devastating
plot shift that forces us to focus—on

Mom and Dad.
To his credit, Todd

 if Field, a ﬁrst-time direc-
 . tor and sometime actor

(the piano player from
“Eyes Wide Shut’?), made a film that
falls into that coveted groupof “faith-
ful movie adaptations.”

Based on Andre Dubus’ short
story “Killings,” “In the Bedroom”
unfolds with a pace and measure that
not only adheres to literary standards
but also holds true naturally, trusting
its characters to propel it to wherever

     

CO URTES Y WW W. Y.’-\ H()()M()VlliS .C()M

it is going. All of the performances are
strong and believable. Even the oft-
discredited Marisa Tomei proved" her-
self here; with this and “Happy
Accidents,” 2001 was kind to her.

In fact, it is only as “In the
Bedroom” ‘moves toward its climax-
that any sort of planned suspense
shows through. But the film builds
such a strong grip over the audience
up to that point that we’ve already
been affected, even drained, by its

every step. And at a 145-minute run-

ning time, that’s pretty good for a

- directorial debut.

A Heartbreaking and emotionally
visceral, “In the Bedroom,” like a few
other films this year (“The Royal
Tenenbaums7"and “Sexy Beast” come,
to mind), must be seen to even come
close to being understood. It rides on
the identiﬁable subt1eties.of family tri-
als and the simple helplessness of_par-
ents, while actually caring about story
and character motivation and perhaps

» this is why it was so difficult to mar-

ket. ‘

Here come 
the Wizards?

 

a Sports Vmw

Brian Goldman 1

With almost half the NBA season‘.

over, the biggest surprise of the season
has to be the success of the Washington
VVizards. Sure, I expected them the ﬁn-
ish about .500 on the season, but I never
expected them to play as well as they
have.

But, could the VV1zards make it to I

the NBA Finals?

It’s quite possible. Stay tuned. This
weekend will show exactly where the
\Vizards‘ stand. Friday night Washington
takes on the 19-13 Milwaukee Bucks,
who are in first place in the Central
Division. Then Saturday, the Wiz come
back home to play the 25-9 Minnesota
Timberwolves.

The Bucks are led ‘by “Big Dawg”
Glen Robinson, who averages 21.8
points per game and almost two steals a

' game. With the return of Sam Cassell

and Ray Allen this past week, the Bucks
stand tall in the Eastern Conference.

The Timberwolves compete in a
tough Western Conference where four
teams have yetito lose 10 games (L.A.,
Sacramento, Minnesota and San
-Antonio). Kevin Garnett, who leads the
team in points, steals, blocks and
rebounds per game, heads up the
Timberwolves.

For the Wizards, these two games
represent a chance for a matchup against
playoff teams, to see where the Wiz
stand halfway through the year. The loss
of Richard Hamilton and Christian
Lattener to ' injuries’ hurt Washington
tremendously. Yet, the VV1zards keep
winmng. ‘ . g . 1

Take away the Wrizards’ 5-12 start
and they are. 13-2 in their last 18 games.
Why the turnaround? Well, not only did

No, 18-ranked Pitt wrestling went into .

Wednesday night’s match against Slippery

Pitt was missing Dan Stine (8-4), Jacob‘

The Panthers started out down 0-3, but
immediately tied the match with a 6-4 deci-

Rock’s Adam Rerinerat 125 pounds. Shawn '
_Amistade (11-4) followed May’s victory

with an 8-2 decision over‘ Slippery Rock’s
Chris Matanese at 133 pounds.
The Rockets tied the match at six after

the 141 bout, but Justin Giovinco (9-4) put’ .

Pitt on top for good with a 3-1 overtime win

J ordan’s now
passing, not
just shooting

Column, page-A14

Jordan motivate the team by telling‘ them
they stink, but Jordan also helped out in

another way: he stopped shooting as

much and started passing.

Because of this “Pass” Jordan as
opposed to “Air” Jordan, MJ only scored
six points a couple weeks ago. And just
in case you didn’t believe Jordan could
carry a game or team, he decided to
score 96 points in his next two games.-

But Jordan does have some help in

Chris Whitney, Brenden Haywood and »

Popeye Jones. A

_Whitney and Jones have provided/ .
_ an inside or outside person for Jordan to _

dish the rock to when he drives in the
lane. This is the basic cause of Jordan
averaging a team best 5.4 assists per
game. . 9' ” A t
Then there is Haywood. Everyone
laughed at Jordan when he took
Haywood, saying that it was just Jordan
being faithful to his alma mater North

. Carolina. Well, to the people that .-

laughed at Jordan, I-say this:
1 Who’s laughing now?

‘ Haywood, in my mind, has been the A A

spark ever since Hamilton pulled his
groin. Haywood is averaging 7.6

rebounds per game and has 1.95 blocks .

per game while only turning the ball
over ‘less than one time per game.
Haywood is proving to Kwame Brown

that college will indeed make you a bet- ’

ter college player. .

, Washington is lucky ' to be in the '
Eastern Conference and Jordan realizes

this. When MJ ﬁrst decided to return to

_ the NBA,_he knew he_was only there for

a couple of years and histeam most like-
ly would never make the NBA‘ Finals.

Now all that -has changed. Jordan 1

now realizes he can indeed make it to the
finals and is in negotiations to trade his
pick 4. for

There aren’t _many teams that can
challenge the VV1zards.« The Bucks are
good, and Philly will be there in April,
but besides that, the Vlrrzards already

~ proved they are better than New Jersey ’

by beating them by more than 20 points.
Get Jordan into the playoffs and

‘ anything can happen. You know that, I—

know that and the league knows that.‘

1 Look for the Wtz in the NBA Finals

come‘ June, and watch this weekend to

see Washington take its first real test of V

the season.

Brian Goldman is a columnist for The '

Pitt News and is faithﬁtl that Pittsburgh
will eventually get a pro basketball
team. _‘

Carlo-Clauss 4-3 to earn third place.

Also at 157 pounds, freshman Justin
Nestor (4-1) saw his ﬁrst action of the year.
Nestor wrestled ﬁve matches andwon four,"

‘ which was good enough for a second place

ﬁnish. Nestor lost to 'Harvard’s Robbie
Griﬁin in the ﬁnals. _ ' ’

Pitt’s other second place ﬁnisher was
Giovinco at 149 pounds. Giovinco 'won‘four
out of his ﬁve matches before losing in the
championship 4-2 to Penn State’s Jason
Woodall.

Other place winners included heavy-

weight Lininger and freshman Ronald‘

rmnnn

Panthers top No. 17 Nittany Lions

oTarquinio at 141 pounds. Lininger placed
ﬁfth and Tarquinio placed sixth.
The Panthers followed up the victory by
defeating the Nittany Lions 18-12 Saturday.
Amistade got things started by beating
Penn State’s Marat Tomaev 5-2, payback

afterAmistade lost to Tomaev 7-6 at the Mat ,

Town Invitational earlier in the season.

Arnistade’s win was followed by three
consecutive Panther losses to give Penn
State a 9-3 lead going into the 165 pound
match. » S ‘

Fronhofer was able to get Pitt back on
track with a 9-4 overtime victory over Don
Vecchio. Catullo then tied the match at nine

with an 8-6 decision’ over Todd Brennan.

Just as Pitt regained momentum, Penn

‘State pulled oﬁ another victory at 184

pounds where Mark Beck earned a 3-1 deci-

‘ sion over Stine.

Again Pitt came up with a victory after
falling behind. At 197 pounds, Sandberg
earned a 3-1 decision over Penn State’s Pete
Mielnik, which tied the match at 12.

Lininger put the Panthers up for good
with a 4-3 victory over the Nittany Lions’
Josh Walker and May sealed the match with

s a 5-1 decision over Justin Kast.

The Panthers (4-1) won four meets in a
row and will now prepare for the Virginia‘
Duals, held today and tomorrow in
Hampton, Va.
