Tela Ropa

From the hippie—inspired clothing
to the ethnic tapestries that adorn the
walls, to the Beatles’ music playing
softly in the background, Tela Ropa
Inc. has what the company’s'presi—
dent, Kevin J aussen, would call a cer-
tain “mystique.”

The store caters to the Led
Zeppelin fan, the hippie and the pyro-
maniac. The future of the establish-
ment is up in the air — but not yet up
in smoke.

Located on.Atwood Street, Tela
Ropa greets customers with a psyche-
delic mural of the Mad Hatter and the
caterpillar, of “Alice in Wonderland”
fame, smoking from a hookah, encir-
cling the staircase that leads up to the
second story location.

The smell of cigarette smoke
wafts through the air in a room deco-
rated with designs and animation
reminiscent of The Beatles’ cartoon
movie, “The Yellow Submarine.”
This same room had previously held
display cases filled ‘with stickers,
patches, clove cigarettes and even
pipes for tobacco, but it now_houses
empty cases, surrounded by several
benches and ashtrays where cus-
tomers and employees can take a
smoking break. I ‘ V v

A sign written by the manage-
ment also greets the customers. It
confirms what has been rumored
throughout Oakland for the last few
months — the future-of Tela Ropa is
in danger. The store may close, for
good, but the company is trying to
renegotiate its lease.

The store holds merchandise rep-
resentative of more than 30 countries,

took over the stage of Club Laga
Wednesday night. a

Who knew the Greeks had such
an array of talents? _  . .

Pitt’s Greek community spon-
sored the annual Greek God and
Goddess talent competition to bene-
fit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation.

' Judges for the event included
Mike “the Miz” Mizanin from
MTV’s the Real World and Pitt bas-
ketball players Chevon Troutman
and Toree Morris.

Participants were judged on
their talents and in a question-and-
answer session. Judges also consid-
ered how the contestants’ looked in

togas and how enthused they made

the crowd.

During the first half of the
show, Sigma Delta Tau sister Shira
Feigelstein sang and played guitar
in a performance of “Puff the Magic
Dragon.” _ ' A

She instructed all audience
members smoking cigarettes to puff

Allison Earnest of Delta Zeta
sang “Sunday Morning” by Maroon
5 a cappella, and a Delta Delta
Delta sister danced and baton-
twirled to Britney Spears’ “Toxic.”
“Ice, Ice Baby” _— the acoustic
version —. was even played by
Terry Meyer of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
After the first portion of the tal-

ent competition, it was time for a
question-and-answer session
with participants decked out in
togas made of everything from toi-
let paper to towels. The judges
asked questions such as, .“What is
your favorite/animal, and why?”

and “What does the acronym MILF I

stand for?’.’ _ »
Theta Phi Alpha sister Lauren
Reighard replied, “Mother «I’d like

to...” refusing to finish the. phrase. ~ — » ‘

Mizanin, disappointed by her
refusal to use profanity, yelled,-“We
are not PG-13; we are rated R.”

Highlights of the second half of
the talent competition included a
performance in which Sigma Alpha
Epsilon member Evan Newman,
with » his “l60-pound, half-
P0lynesian” counterpart, rapped
and beat-boxed a cover of “Lodi

Formerly “depressed
Southern guy” returns
to Pittsburgh to speak

DAN HENSLEY
Staff Writer

When Tony Earley lived in
Ambridge, outside Pittsburgh, he
was “a depressed Southern guy
thinking about jumping _ off
bridges.”

“You take a depressed Southern
guy and drop him in Pittsburgh in
the winter, with all those bridges —
well, you do the math,” he said.

Immediately after stepping
onstage in the Frick Fine Arts audi-
torium Wednesday evening, award-
winning author and former
Ambridge resident Tony Earley
employed the dark humor that char-
acterizes his short stories.

“It’s nice to be back ’ in
Pittsburgh, although I never imag-
ined myself saying those words,” he
added. ‘ ‘ ‘ .

Earley, whose novel “Jim the
Boy” and collections of short sto-
ries and nonfiction .— “Here We Are
in Paradise” and “Somehow Form a
Family: Stories That Are Mostly
True,” respectively — have gar-
nered high acclaim from The New
Yorker and The New York Times,
among other publications. Two of
his stories have been included in the
Best American Short Stories
anthologies.

Earley visited Pitt on
Wednesday as part of the Pittsburgh
Contemporary Writers Series, spon-
sored by Pitt’s writing program.

_ Jeff Oaks, managing director of
the 1 series, was excited about
Earley’s reading.

“We ask a certain number of fic-
tion and nonfiction writers and
poets every year, and? we try to find
writers who are the most excellent
we can find,” Oaks said. “He was
one of our choices for this year.”

The reading, which was free and
open to the public,’ drew a diverse
crowd, ranging from undergradu-
ates to the elderly. Pitt’s own
award—winning. “ author . Buddy
Nordan enthusiastically introduced
Earley.

“If you don’t know his work or

don’t know it well, get to know it ~

— he is a great writer,” Nordan
said.

Earley read two short stories for
his presentation, punctuating the
narratives with terse but witty com-
ments. The audience was invited to
a reception immediately after the

reading and was given an opportu-

nity to meet Earley.

The Pittsburgh Contemporary
Writers Series continues next month
with two poets, Judith Vollmer and
Joe Weil, speaking on March 4.

    Decision to sell pipes

Friday, February 13, 2004

Tela Ropa, page 1

including a painted, blue, sun-shaped
mirror from Indonesia, hand—sewn
vmittens from Pakistan and embroi-
dered cotton purses from India.

There are tie—dyed T—shirts for_ the
whole family, including a wee one for
‘a baby. .

There are numerous sticks of
incense giving off fragrances of jas-
mine and patchouli.

The whole store is a hodgepodge
of ethnic and 1960s clothes, candles,

‘incense and jewelry for. the entire
body. .

But since Tela Ropa may be going

‘ out of business, everything is 25 to 75

percent off, and the shelves and dis-

. plays look a little emptier than usual.

The decision is hard for Jaussen,
he said. Tela Ropa is his livelihood,
and he started building it in 1989. The
company moved from Massachusetts
to Pittsburgh in 1991, and it moved
into the Oakland location later that
year. In 1995, Jaussen made what may
now seem to be a regrettable business
decision. Pushed by nearby competi-
tion, Tela Ropa began selling water-
pipes and wooden pipes.

Jaussen explained that he called
the Drug Enforcement Agency and
left seven messages. He also consult-
ed the Pittsburgh police before mak-
ing the decision to sell pipes.

“The Pittsburgh cops said it was
just a misdemeanor, and [selling
pipes] was a gray area,” Jaussen said.
So, to keep upwith area head shops,
Jaussen rented out another room on

the same floor as Tela Ropa and
began selling them.

“I did it because my ‘customers
wanted it,” Jaussen explained. Tela
Ropa continued selling pipes until
1999, when police gave a warning to
the company. Tela Ropa did not sell
them again until Christmas of 2002 —
to pick up business — this time only

_in a small section of display cases, he

said.

Customer Justin Blott, a former
Pitt student, remembers the pipe room
fondly. According to Blott, as he was
browsing the pipes several years ago,
he ran into actor Jason Mewes —
known for his. portrayal of “Jay” in

,movies such as “Dogma” and “Jay

and Silent Bob Strike Back.”

“It was 4/20, and we saw him in
the pipe room, and it was the coolest

thing ever,” Blott said. “I got his auto-
graph on a Taco Bell receipt.”

Blott acknowledged that he was
originally interested in shopping at
Tela Ropa because of its reputation
for being a head shop.

But on Feb. 24, 2003, as part of a
nationwide investigation entitled
“Operation Pipe Dreams,” Tela
Ropa’s reputation led police to raid
the store. Pittsburgh city police raided
the" store and confiscated the pipes.
Jaussen and 27 other individuals from
other establishments were charged
with conspiracy to sell and offering to
sell drug paraphernalia. v

sessed turned sour.

‘.‘It gave us a bad stigma.
Everybody thought we were closed,”
Jaussen said. “People kind of ran.”

After “Operation Pipe Dreams,”
Tela Ropa remained open, but cus-
tomers had already been lost. J aussen
admitted that, while the bust wasn’t
his primary reason for potentially
closing the store, it did hurt business.

“Retail is a very sensitive, fragile
balance between you and your cus-
tomers,” Jaussen said. “I took a
chance in selling those pipes, I made
a mistake, and I paid for it.” ,

Besides being unable to sell the
highly popular pipes and facing fines

_ from the federal government, paying

expensive utility rates forced J aussen
to consider closing the business. He

has devoted the past ‘several months.

to trying to rebuild Tela Ropaland

renegotiate the lease, while at the"

same time getting rid of the merchan-
dise. L

‘Jaussen explained that they are
remodeling the front room of the store
to draw a larger crowd of cigarette
smokers. He noted that they are
putting up tables, chairs and ashtrays,
and will possibly serve tea and coffee

to encourage people to come and chill '

at the store.

“We’re trying to rebuild, and we
still have great products at great
prices,” J aussen said.

J aussen said he realized he could
get stuff in to make the store more
like the retail chain Hot Topic, which
he said is very popular right now, but
that’s' not what he wants for his com-
pany. '

“I don’t want to sell ‘F—— You’
shirts,” Jaussen said.

Blott also wants Tela Ropa to stay
in business. '

“I was upset” he said of learning
that the store might close. .

“It’s always been a fixture of
Oakland,” he added.

In the next few weeks, J aussen
will have to make the decision about
whether or not to keep his business
open. For now, Tela Ropa is still try-
ing to stay alive and unique.

U.S. shou1dn’t ban cloning research

South Korean scientists have cloned
human embryos, in research they hope will
help to treat such conditions as diabetes
and Parkinson’s disease, but they do not
intend to clone humans with this discovery.
This research was published yesterday in
“Science,” and it has been hailed as “land-
mar ” and “amazing’_’ by American scien-
tists interviewed in The New York Times.

American opposition to this research
has already been voiced, particularly by the
chairman of the President’s Council on
Bioethics, who “calledfor federal legisla-
tion to stop human cloning for any pur-
pose,” according to The Times.

By calling for this, the chairman, Dr.
Leon Kass, is asking the United States to
remove itself from what has become an
international discussion on the merits and

« ethics of cloning. Rather than calling for _
sensible legislation that would ban human B
cloning for baby-making purposes, but not

for research purposes, as South Korea has,
he proposed an outright moratorium that, if
passed, would give the United States no
ground in arguing for reasonable research
in other countries.

Kass described the work at Seoul

A National University, led by Dr. Woo\Suk ,
Hwang and Dr. Shin Yong Moon, as part of

a slippery. slope, one that would lead to
eventual “Brave New World”-style baby
making. ’ s .

But these. scientists are clearly not

' playing God. They tried 14 different proto-

cols; they took 242 eggs, of which they

selected 176 to remove‘ genetic» material
from. Thirty of these grew into blastocysts
—- microscopic balls of cells — 20 of
which they could extract material from,
and only one of which yielded a stem cell
line. All of this was done in laboratory
dishes, yielding embryos of no more than
100 cells,ino bigger than speck of dust.

_ Dystopian visions of manufactured

babies do not match up with the precise '

science involved in these experiments.
These embryos, if implanted in a woman,
could yield‘ viable offspring,.as laboratory
growth and implantation is already used in
in vitro fertilization. Yet this was not the
intention of the experimenters, nor is it
their future goal.

And, if it is to remain this way, the

’ United States shouldldraw clear distinc-

tions between legitimate science and the
rogue experiments that could receive inter-
est and funding if stem cell research is not
allowed. This is no longer a national issue
— it’s an international one. _

There is a clear middle ground here.
As Gerald Schatten, an anirnal-cloning
researcher at Pitt’s School of Medicine told
The Washington Post, “It would be naive
to say this isn’t a step closer to irresponsi-
ble people attempting reproductive
cloning.” Yet the article also reports that he
“opposes human cloning but favors the
research,” The United States should do the
same, and do so quickly, in order to main-
tain its place in the w_orld’s scientiﬁc com-
munity.

Beer,kazoos clearly not meant for teens

Somewhere, a Clydesdale is crying.

He’s crying because he feels betrayed.
The company he works for — works long,
hard hours for — is under attack. Anheuser-
Busch, the brewing company who, for years,
has employed majestic Clydesdales as

Budweiser mascots, is being

sued for" $4 billion. The suit,

charges Anheuser—Busch with,
unbelievably, advertising to
minors. '’

Take a moment to appre-
ciate the absundity of this suit.
Steve’ Berman, a class-action
lawyer who successfully sued
tobacco makers under a simi-
lar law, wants us to believe
brewing companies target
minors. He claims they pack-
age their malt beverages to
look like soda, advertise on youth—favorite
television shows, and give away teen—friend—
ly promotional items, such as kazoos.

Let’s look at the facts. Anheuser—Busch
airedseveral ads for its popular Bud Light
brand during the Super Bowl. The ﬁrst fea-
tured a dog who’d maul your crotch just to
get a Bud Light. In the next, Cedric the
Entertainer accidentally gets a bikini wax —
which means they ripped all the hair off his
crotch,

In another, Bud Light turns an ordinary
chimp into a suave ladies’ man, in homage to
“Z001: A Space Odyssey.” The chimp puts
his aim around the sweet young thing next to
him and says, “How do you feel about back
hair?” The specter of impending bestiality
hovers over this ad’s ambiguous ending. In
another commercial, a romantic sleigh ride
turns foul when a wicked horse fart sends a
ﬁreball ﬂaming into the snowy night.

Are we really supposed to believe these
ads were aimed at teen-agers? Suggesting
that your average teen would have the matu-
rity and sophistication to appreciate a crotch-
biting dog or horse-fueled explosion is like

anced teen—age boys. Obviously these com-
mercials are pitched at intelli-
gent, museurn-attending adults
who appreciate the aesthetics of
a genital mauling. If any teens

Pllilll-90llllIB|'ll0illI: Pre-marital Sex

Maybe all men are dogs, but at

Pre—marital sex: Getting your
freak onbefore you put a ring on

The institution of marriage is getting
paid a lot of lip service these days.

Conservatives and moralizers every-
where bemoan that the “sacred institu-
tion” is being eroded by sex-crazed liber-
als — and sex columnists —— who would
dare to pollute the minds of the nation’s
youth with information about contracep-
tion and safe sex. In the face
of a worldwide pandemic of
sexually transmitted diseases
and unwanted pregnancies
clogging the welfare rolls, the
current administration wants
to tum its back on the exis-
tence of premarital sex, to
turn a blind eye to a glaring
need in youth education and
to ignore the opportunity to
do real good.

That is more perverted
than any kind of sex act, be it
in a marital bower, a college dorm or the
back seat of a tricked-out Honda Civic.

If waiting until marriage to have sex
makes sense to you, then, by all means,
keep your pants on. It’s a respectable deci-
sion, and one I would never impugn. It is,
after all, the best method of preventing
diseases or unwanted pregnancy.

That said, if you use your head, there
is no compelling reason to wait if you
don’t want to — not to please your parents
or potential mate, not to appease some
vengeful god and certainly not to keep
your own sexual currency high.

I’d like to think that anyone I would
choose to marry would trust me enough to
know that my premarital adventures aren’t
going to somehow sully our sexual rela-
tionship. I don’t have unsafe sex, and I see
my gynecologist every year. Disease is not
an issue. My exploits before marching
down any aisle will fade into pleasant
memory, and my partner will become my
sex life. -

I’ve sampled a wide variety of pre-
marital delights. I’ve explored some dark
places in my own sexual psyche, checked
out both genders and many permutations
of threesomes and more-somes. And
when I do decide to enter into a lifelong
commitment, that one person can rest eas-
ily knowing that I’ve seen what the world
has to offer, and have decided that what
that person has trumps it all. That, kids, is
romance.

Sex is powerful and important and
can be sacred. It’s also a lot of fun, and
unfortrmately, ﬂre subject of so many
hang-ups for so many people, people who
live under a tremendous burden of guilt
surrounding this giant, unknown quantity

that’s everywhere. It’s a big deal, but not
that big of a deal.

Most of us recall being young teen-
agers' and getting some urges we didn’t
quite understand. Some of us went on to
act on them. Others went completely
freaking nuts while thinking they were
horrible people for having these urges.

When a person waits,
who knows what they may
end up with in their marriage
bed? Imagine a woman who
waited, on her ﬁrst night with
her new husband, who’s
maybe a little kinky, or
maybe a complete jerk How
is she supposed to know that
it’s not supposed to hurt like
that, or that she’s entitled to
some soul-shaking orgasms?

Sex is the glue that holds
a romantic relationship
together. ‘It’s often the ﬁrst thing to go
when love dies. So, clearly, sexual com-
patibility is a huge issue in determining a
successful marriage. That’s something
that merits investigation before making a
lifelong commitment. Few people would
buy a car without taking a test drive.

Sex is a function of the human roman-
tic relationship. It’s what distinguishes
romantic liaisoris from others, even loving
ones. I have male friends I dearly love —
but I would never have sex with them. To
my mind, a romantic relationship is never
truly solidiﬁed until sex enters the equa-
tion.

Every individual has his or her own
threshold, his or her own level of relating
to another human where physical intima-
cy is appropriate. For some, that threshold
is marriage. For others, it’s mutually pro-
fessed love. And for still others, it’s the
ability to recall a potential mate’s ﬁrst

name. Within the conﬁnes of mutual’

thresholds, there is no such thing as per-
version, and no reason to feel’ guilty. ' 

Saving sex for marriage means that
sex will beisomething uniquely shared
between the spouses. It’s a nice notion, but
a bit antiquated. In my putative married
life, I’ll sharea mortgage, children, and
probably a dog. —I don’t need sex to be one
of our “onlies.” ;  , '

For those that choose to have sex
prior to marriage, monogarny and" matri-
mony are the ﬁnal sexual frontier, a fasci-
nating new world. I’m looking forward to
arriving there, but I’m enjoying the jour-
ney to the fullest.

least I’m one of the good ones

I got the inspiration for this Valentine’s
Day discussion on Nov. 3 of last year. That
was the day a girl wrote to Melissa saying
her boyfriend would be upset if he knew she
had slept with 36 guys by the time she
turned 19. In response, Melissa compared
the girl’s boyfriend to a monk and wrote
that, while 36 is a high number, it’s “not
unreasonable.” This exchange
surprised me because 1) 36 is
unreasonable, and 2) her
boyfriend did have a right to
ask. While I respect Melissa as
a writer and a friend, I don’t
support her weekly stance on
free, ﬁivolous sex. The oppos-
ing view, should be voiced, if
only once, in the course of the
year.

I’m a proponent of absti-
nence before marriage. In
preparing for our discussion,
Melissa had a number of pertinent questions
that helped to frame my column, and it put
me in the enviable position of one who gets
to educate the campus unlicensed sexpert.
When I say abstinence, I mean abstaining
from sex — oral, traditional, whatever —
until the wedding day. This is a personal
conviction that must be held on an individ-
ual basis, not something I want legislated or
forced down anyone’s throat, and no, I don’t
see sex as a simple means of procreation —

once rings are on ﬁngers, it’s anything goes.

I’ve chosen this stancefor a variety of
reasons — romantic, spiritual, conscien-
tious and practical. I like the idea of saving
myself for my Wife, the purity that comes
with conscious sacriﬁce and the assurance
that I will never contribute to the spread of
disease or to unplanned pregnancy.

I’ ve noticed the emotional baggage that
comes with “free” sex and_ the veriﬁable

connection between cohabitation and,

divorce — the more "we “try things out,” the
less we commit to anything lasting.“ I.
Andperhaps above all, Ipbject to the

 natureofoursexualclimate,perpetuatedby

opinions like Melissa’s. The prevailing sen-
timent is that promiscuous sexuality is
inevitable, that people are driven by instinct
and incapable of responsible choices.

In modern terms, sex is oﬁenvportrgfayed

as purely natural, which demands the argu-‘
ment, “Why deny our biological appetites?”
Well, ﬁrst we must ask ourselves how nat-
ural our appetites are, and how much they
are inﬂuenced by a culture ﬂrat markets to
them. Ifaliens were to'visitEarth, they
would probably ﬁnd our sex obsession con-
fusing. ' A

In one of my favorite illustrations, C.S.
Lewis describes the phenomenon in refer-

ence to strippers:
“Now suppose you came to a country
where you could ﬁll a theatre by simply

’ bringing a covered plate on to the stage and

slowly lifting the cover so as to let every one
see, just before‘ the lights went out, that it
contained a mutton chop or a bit of bacon,
would you not think that in that country
something had gone wrong
with the appetite for food?”

Certainly, then, our
national sex appetite has gone
wrong, and sexuality has taken
command with expansive,
unopposed authority. ‘It is a
foregone conclusion that
young people even
teenagers and pre-teens — will
begin having sex, _unques-
tioned by parents and school
nurses. In high school, we are
written, off immediately;
informed about our “raging hormones,” and
absolved of responsibility. When I was a
kid, we had a dog that would never miss an
opportunity to hump your leg; when I
turned 13, my health teacher explained to
me that, now, I was that dog.

I .Whenever sexual responsibility_ is dis-
cussed, in any forum, the speaker always
begins with the same sentence: “Of course,
the only 100 percent effective contraceptive
is abstinence.” That sentence is then fol-
lowed by twenty-ﬁve paragraphs of less
effective approaches that are, at least, “real-
istic.” In an environment with as many sex-
oriented problems as ours, why does the
sure-ﬁre cure get no love?

When considered logically, abstinence
is not only realistic, but also downright
smart. But since it runs contrary to our pop-
ular sexual discourse, it can’t seem to win a
strong endorsement from anyone hip.
Though Melissa is a talented writer, I doubt
her column would get read if it was called
“Chastity N’at.” '

I hope I don’t come off sounding anti-
sex, because that couldn’t be ﬁrrther from
the truth. It’s probably crossed my mind
close to a hundred times whﬂe writing this
column. I’m simply opposed to a discourse

thatcheapens sex.Tseeitasapowerful and

lasting bond between man and wife, not a
weekend party favor, and it concerns me
that We’ve reached the point where having
36 partners by the age of 19 is “not unrea-
sonable.” I understand the appeal as much
as the next guy, and whﬂe that probably
does make rrre a dog, I still choose not to

hump legs.

You want to start off kind of

then Old Blue. Eyes himself, Frank

you want them back, and then the next four songs
can hit them like a ton of bricks.

2. Alanis Morissette — “You Oughta

This is the “right after the
breakup” song. You’re still a little
sad, almost psycho—stalker. “And I’m
here/ to remind you/ of the mess you
left when you went away.”
Morissette shares a post-breakup
anthem that has had millions of the
broken-hearted singing along with
her.

3. Ben Folds Five — “Song for the

So you just got dumped. You real-

Only the lonely: games for the singles out there

For a good percentage of
video game enthusiasts, Feb.
14 is nowhere near as impor-
tant as Feb. IS, the day when
all the unsold Valentine’s
Day chocolate goes on sale.
To them, the red—and—pink—
and—white wrappers mean
nothing —— their only con-
cern is with the caffeine-
loaded block of sugary
goodness inside. We salute
these dateless devotees of
digital diversions by pre-
senting a few great games to

play solo.
“Super Smash Brothers
Melee” (Nintendo,

Gamecube) is a staple of
gamer gatherings, but loses
none of its luster in its sin-
gle-player offerings. With
three different one-player
courses — Classic,
Adventure, and Al1—Star —
and plenty of extras, like the
Home-Run Contest and
Event Mode challenges,
there’s plenty to do on your
own. Finishing certain goals
can even unlock new characters,
turning your time alone into an
investment in the future.

slips into a coma an hour into the the time of the incident. Thus begins

a four—chapter—long trek across
this game—within-a-game,
searching for answers and a way
to cure the coma victims. The
game as a whole takes about 80
to 100 hours to complete, and is

broken into four volumes, the A

first of which can be purchased
for about $20.

For those of you who want
nothing more- than to relive the
days of your childhood, salva-
tion lies with “Activision

PlayStation 2).,Travel back to a
time when gender relations were
less complicated with this beau-

designed to resemble your room
back in ’1985, complete with a
boom box blasting A—Ha,
Twisted Sister and a bevy of
other big ‘SOS bands. The classic
feel is replicated in everything
from the patches you can earn
by performing well to the origi-

A romantic dinner for two
requires plastic silverware

Did you open your wallet the
other day to find out you had a
stack of receipts and coupons, but
no cash? Experiencing poor college
student syndrome? And of all the
times 

Valentine’s Day is almost here,
and you need to woo your lovely
lady or man. Well, lift your head
high, because right before the light
at the end of the tunnel fades, you
remember you have your meal plan
— or if not, you could scrounge up
a'few extra dollars from a friend.
Say to yourself, “I will not be lone-
ly on V—Day!” You’re taking your
date’ —— or if you prefer your inde-
pendence, then yourself — to
Eddie’s.

The pros: A meal that provides
all the food groups, in which you
can keep it casual. No formal dress
is required to get in the door. And
the bestpart? There is no need to
tip. Save those few. extra dollars to
buy your date a rose. You’re not
responsible for paying a server who
forgot to get you that refill.

The meal: As in every classy
restaurant and every fancy meal,
you start off with your appetizer.
Fondue, anyone? Eddie’s has a sim-
ilar delicacy. Who can go without
those salted pretzel bites dipped in
a creamy,- nacho cheese sauce?

The part of the evening that
could get really fun is when you
and your date take turns feeding
each other. But turn down the wings
from “Sunset Strips.” You don’t

want to embarrass yourself or soil
your Febreezed white shirt.

Filet mignon or crab cakes, any-
one? Eddie’s may not have prime
rib, but it does have some great
alternatives.

For your main course, you and
your date could be adventurous and
get the “Meal Block Special” which
features one entree, two sides, and a
medium beverage. Similar to a
home—cooked meal, you’ll wonder

‘why your friends are spending big

bucks at coat—and—tie restaurants
when you have exquisite dining in
your own neighborhood.

Or perhaps you’re in the mood
for the ‘.‘Fiesta of Flavor.” But
maybe a more appropriate name
should be the “Fiesta of Love.”
After you bite into a chicken burri-
to, you may begin to get a little
sloppy, since it’s just that good.

As for dessert? Do I dare say
creme brulee? Eddie’s has the deca-
dent dessert of your choice. Grab
one plastic fork and share a slice of
chocolate cake. You know how sexy
fudge can be. Aphrodisiac, anyone?

Finish your meal off at Eddie’s
Cafe with a steaming cappuccino.
You and your date can stare into
each other’s eyes while sipping on
this hot treat. A

Perhaps you’ll wink, and your
date will nod, and you know what

— that means: a buffet brunch at The

Pitt takes

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

At stake in Sunday’s game against '

Connecticut for the Pitt men’s basketball
team is first place in the Big East confer-
ence, the nation’s longest home winning
streak, and a potential No. 1 seedin the
NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament
next month.

However, if you asked Panther head

coach Jamie Dixon, he would tell you that I

this weekend’s game is nodifferent than
any other game.

“We have to look at every game like
it’s just as important as our ﬁrst league

game,” Dixon said. “And if we don’t, we ’

wouldn’t be standing where we are in the
standings right now, because you can slip
up with a -lack of eﬁort in one gameor
two games. If you don’t look at every
game the same, then you’re going to fall.
And I think our league‘has proven that
day in and day out,”

Against the Huskies (19-4 overall, 7-
2 Big East) last month, Pitt lost to
Connecticut, 68-65, at the end of regula-
tion after freshman guard Antonio

Graves’ game-tying shot attempt bounced

off the rim. ,
While the Panthers (22-2, 8-2) felt
they should ‘have won the game, the close

score solidiﬁed their spot as a legitimate
contender for the Big East and‘National
titles. In Sunday’s game, Pitt will look to
employ a similar game plan against the

_ Huskies and hope for a better outcome.

“We’re going to just emphasize the
same things,” Dixon said. “Rebounding

and defending. And we did a lot of things
very well the last time we played
[Connecticut], but we could have done
some things better. And we go into every
game trying to think We’re improved. We

Time isrrunning out for the Pitt women’s basket-

With five games left in the season, the Panthers
(6-15 overall, 2-9 Big East) stand in 13th place in the Big
East Conference. Both St. J ohn’s and Providence are one
game ahead of Pitt in the conference standings. Only the
top 12 teams make the Big East Tournament in March.

Saturday, Pitt has another chance to pick up a vic-

‘ , Georgetown sophomore Carmen Bruce. Bruce’s father,

tory at home against Georgetown. The Hoyas (10-12, 4-
7), much like Rutgers, are a strong and physical team
that can wear teams down. But Pitt knows that if it is to
make its own conference tournament, the six—game los-
ing streak that the team is currently on must end
Saturday. A .
“This game Saturday is the biggest one we have
left,” junior guard Amy Kunich said. “You don’t want to
not get invited to your own banquet.”

Saturday will also be a homecoming for

Pitt still has

streak intact

Many Pitt fans probably have a
lasting memory of freshman Antonio
Graves’ missed last-second shot that
hit the back of the basket and rattled
out, ending UConn and Pitt’s first
nmwﬂng- .

The missed shot was a desperate
attempt to send the game into over-
time and to keep Pitt’s undefeated
streak alive. Unfortunately, Pitt’s
streak ended that night with a 68-65
loss at the hands of the Huskies.

Well there is another streak that is
still intact, and it would be unfortu-
nate for UConn to have a hand.in
snapping yet another Panthers’ streak.
The Panthers have won 39 straight
home games and have yet to lose at
the Petersen Events Center, which has
been their home for almost two full
basketball seasons.

If you remember correctly, Pitt
did not play well in the first half of the
two squads’ matchup earlier this sea-
son. As a matter of fact, guards Julius
Page and Carl Krauser got into early
foul trouble, which forced both play-
ers to the bench early.

Of course, the Huskies took
advantage of two Panther starters
being on the bench and built a big
lead. Pitt eventually had to play catch-
up and was able to get into position to
tie the game as regulation expired.

Another problem was there were
way too many uncontested shots in
the paint. UConn Center Emeka
Okafor scored nine in the ﬁrst half,
but was shut down in the second half,
being held to two points.

Pitt did a great job of making the
necessary adjustments to defend
Okafor, but appeared to forget that
there were other capable big men on

cares? The National
League, as we know it, won’t exist
next year. With ongoing labor dis-
agreements and ABC cutting its
contract with the NHL after this
season, professional hockey is
doomed.

But no need to ‘fear, hockey
fans, because college hockey is
peaking at just the right time. While
it’s not yet as popular as college
football or college basketball, the
number of people starting to recog-
nize college hockey is rising every
day. ‘

Last weekend in ‘Boston, the

annual Beanpot Tournament took_

"place. This is a tournament of teams
in the Boston’ area Boston
University, Boston College,
Harvard and Northeastern. Last
weekimarked the 52nd annual tour-
nament between thesefour teams.
The finals came down to BC and
Boston. Boston is a 25-time winner

a of this tournament, but had been

struggling this season heading into
the Beanpot Tournament.

When you think of rivalries in
college sports, one might think of
Michigan-Ohio State in football, or_
D‘uke—North Carolina in basketball.
But in hockey, one of the biggest, if
not the biggest, is BC against
Boston. On Monday evening, junior
Ryan Murphy scored with six min-

utes remaining in overtime to give,
, BC the victory over Boston, earning

the Eagles the
Championship. . L
After the win, BC also found out
it had reached No. 1 in the country,
edging out North Dakota, Maine
and Minnesota. [With only a few

Beanpot

weeks left in the season, conference .
— championships are also on the line.

take on i"n—state rival Minnesota-
Duluth twice this weekend. Duluth
is ranked sixth in the nation and sits
atop the Western Athletic Hockey
Association. Junior Lessard heads
Duluth with 38 points, and is second
in the conference. Right behind
Lessard, in third place, is Minnesota
rival Thomas Vanek, with 35 points.

Minnesota is in desperate need of a V

win over the first—place Duluth

squad to keep its hopes up for a con-

ference title.

The Hockey East Conference
boasts the games of the week Friday
and Saturday as No. l3—ranked
Massachusetts will.’ take on newly
crowned top-ranked.BC. While the
rankings might be a bit far apart,
UMass stands only one point behind
BC for first place in the conference.
The teams will play a home-in-
home series this weekend, where
UMass will look to gain at least a
win and a tie to take over first place
in the conference. 2

The Minutemen are led by
defenseman Thomas Puck. Puck has
14 goalsand 19 assists on the sea-
son and stands in second place in
the Hockey East Conference in
points. Meanwhile, the Eagles are
coming off of their Beanpot
Championship victory and are led
by forward Ryan Shannon, who has
30 points on the season.

While none of these games will
be nationally televised, the atmos-
phere at both Amherst, Mass., and
Chestnut Hill,’ Mass., will be elec-
tric. V .

Unlike college football, college
hockey does have a fair champi-
onship, much like college basket-
ball’s March Madness. The Frozen
Four, as opposed to Final Four, will
be played this year in Boston April
8th and 10th. ‘ ,

So just remember, hockey fans,
there is hope for next year. Next
year, we will watch college hockey.
They don’t argue over labor. These

1-are the type of players who ‘played

for Herb Brooks and the 1980 U.S.
Olympic Team. They play the game
for free, and they love doing it.

Center Chris Taft slam dunks over a St. John’s defender during the Panthers vic-

tory over St. J ohn’s.

have a couple of different emphases in
today’s practice and the next couple of
day’s practice where we’ll try to improve
on, but that’s what we do after every
game‘ and before every game.”

In "the first game, the Panthers, on the
strength of junior forward Chevon
Troutrnan’s defense, held Connecticut’s
leading scorer and National Player of the
Year candidate, junior Emeka Okafor, to
11 points, nearly eight below his average.
However, against Notre Dame on
Monday, Okafor’ registered 24 points,
nine rebounds, and four blocks in the los-
ing effort for the Huskies.

Another National Player of the Year
candidate leads Connecticut’s backcouit,
as junior Ben Gordon averages nearly 18
points per game and leads the Big East
Conference in three-point shooting, con-

necting on approximately 45 percent of.

his three-point attempts. However, in
J anuary’s game against Pitt, it was sopho-
more forward Denham Brown who led
the Huskies with a team-high 20 points
against the Panthers.

“[Connecticut is] very talented all the
way through,” Dixon said. “They obvi-

Panthers need to cover all five players

Nocks page 11

the ﬂoor. UConn forward Josh Boone espe-
cially took advantage of the attention
Okafor was getting as he scored 10 points
and grabbed five boards.

Forward Denham Brown was not a
problem in the paint, but was the main
Huskies’ player who was overlooked. He
was able to lead UConn in scoring, with 20
points, shooting 8-of-12 from the field and
2-for-3 from beyond the arc.

I’m sure when Pitt was going over film,
the last person they were worried about
was Brown. But that may cause the
Panthers to be vulnerable —— when they for-
get about a player and focus too much on a
team’s main threat. So the Panthers have to
cover all of their bases in order for Pitt to
rebound from another sloppily played
game that cost it the game against Seton
Hall. ‘ '

It is mind-boggling how 5-foot-l0-inch-

Andre Barrett -— if he is really even that
tall; he was just 5-foot-7 two seasons ago
—— drove the lane with ease and scored on
more than one occasion. Or how Grant
Billmeier, who averaged 1.5 points per

game going into the contest with Pitt,

scored eight points in the first half.
But this time, the major problem in
Pitt’s 68-67 double-overtime loss was not

forgetting about other players on the ﬂoor;
it was turnovers. A team cannot afford to
turn the ball over 24 times and expect to
win. That was the most appalling part
about the loss — Pitt could have dominat-
ed this game and never ‘been in double
overtime had it simply taken ‘care of the
ball.

Seton Hall only was able to score 68
points in a game that featured two overtime
periods, so that illustrates that, if Pitt had

.played its game, the game would have
never been in question. ,

One streak still remains, and the
Panthers need to protect that streak. The
brand of basketball that they have been
playing lately, where Pitt falls behind by
several points early, cannot continue. The
competition is getting ready to be a lot
stiffer than Notre Dame or Seton Hall. '

Both of the poorly played games in
question have been on the road, so if the
Panthers play their game, they should leave
the Pete on Sunday with the streak intact.
Pitt will have the crowd behind it, and the
Panthers have demonstrated time and time
again that they can force teams to play at
their tempo. At this point, the Panthers are
their own worst enemy.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports editor
for The Pitt News.

ously have a name. Tl1ey’re a major uni-
versity that attracts people from all over
the country and have very good players
and a very good coach with an outstand-
ing reputation. So they have a lot of great’
things going for them.” ‘

Like the Huskies, the Panthers will
also be coming off a Monday loss.
Against Seton Hall, Pitt lost in double
overtime by the score of 68-67. Troutman
and freshman forward Chris Taft both
recorded double-doubles with 10 points
and 11 rebounds, and 16 points and 15

rebounds, respectively. Sophomore guard ‘

Carl Krauser led the Panthers with 23
points despite fouling out late in the
game. ‘

Taft is looking forward to the
rematch with Connecticut and the excite-
ment that will engulf the Petersen Events
Center on Sunday afternoon.

“We just got to go out there and play
our game,” Taft said. “Everybody is
going to be hyped up for it and we just
have to be ready.”

The game on Sunday is scheduled to
begin at 1:30 p.m. and will be nationally
televised on ABC, with Brent Musberger
calling the play-by—play and Dick Vitale
providing the color commentary.

Choosing a place to live is difficult _but very
important and deserves the investment of your
time. We suggest you compare numerous
apartments, check out the reputations _of the
landlords, and talk to the existing tenants when
the landlord is not there. To start you off on
the “right” track, call our number (24 hours)
and leave your name and address (and your
parents?) so that we may mail you detailed
information for your consideration.
