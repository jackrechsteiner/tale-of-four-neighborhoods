The provost said he ‘has
ﬁelded many complaints about

the system in recent weeks, par- ,

ticularly from faculty who use

the Courselnfo system.
Courselnfo is an integrated

software package that allows fac-

V ulty to develop, manage and use
Web pages for instruction. It -

offers tools to administer, grade
and record quizzes, and facili-
tates instructors’ efforts to ‘send
e—mail, transferﬁles to and from
students and manage an on-line

gradebook. The service involves ’
‘ about 1,000 faculty members and

serves about one-third of the stu-
dent population.

“The fact that doubling the
number of processors in the con-
trol server that serves
Courselnfo, and in ﬁnding that
the system loaded down at times
since then, is an ‘especially bad
sign, because it does suggest that
we need to do some

' reconfiguring,” Maher said.

“And reconﬁguring is not some-

thing that can be done gracefully ’

during the term. We have to
handle this as fast as we can, so
we man go into the Christmas
holidays knowing exactly what
has to be done by January.”
Maher said the triumvirate of

 responsibility centers involved
in Pitt’s computer services, the"
Center for Instructional Devel- ,0
opment (CIDDE), Network Ser-

vices, and Computing Services

and Systems Development, was
, evaluating the whole network

operation. “We’re trying to get a
plan, staging all the things that
we really need to get done over

. the next few weeks. But at the

moment we’re studying the

the school’s prestige. 0
“Also, I have served on the
scientiﬁc review section for the

helped our research efforts here

‘”Clia‘ncellior Mark Norden- -

berg added, “We have _tried very
hard to do everything we can to
create a good learning environ-
ment, whether that includes
technology or otherinstructional
enhancements. We do feel we
fell short in this particular case.”

_ The two ofﬁcials were re-
sponding to remarks made at
Senate Council by faculty mem-
ber Jim Holland. Holland also
had raised the issue at the Oct. 3

’ Faculty Assembly, calling the

Courselnfo system “a nightmare
that has ruined my courses.”
Faculty Assembly _members
had agreed that the problems
should be discussed by the Sen-
ate educational policies and stu-

- dent affairs committees, in prepa-
.ration for Courselnfo offerings

in the spring term.

' Alsoat FacultyAssembly,]inx
Walton, director of Computing
Services and Systems Develop-
‘ment, said that two actions had
already been taken: purchasing
nearly double the amount of
bandwidth (network capacity)

and emphasizing to the Univer-

sity communitythat the network

Dean E|_Ien Rudy

should limit usage of bandwidth-
intensive applications.

' But at Senate Council'Maher
said, “We have succeeded in re-
cent years in providing training
in things like Courselnfo for so
many faculty and that involve so
many of our students. We think,
even though we’ve put a lot of
money into this, we have caused
ourselves some problems in the
course of the demand building
up. System failures are not just
related to the level of activity,
but when you strain a system,
you ﬁnd out what the weak points
are.”

Maher said he was conﬁdent
the network evaluation would
lead to a workable plan. “I think
we can to it in weeks, but we
can’t do it in days.”

Maher added that two com-
ponents of any plan will include
warning users of problems "and
training Help Desk staff to tell
users what to do. “The essential
coordinators for all users of the
network are Jinx’s Help Desk
staff. She-is currently organizing
all that and what has to happen.

to get this right, butl do ask you

INII a chair in
patient care?

To the editor:

I don’t mean to be irreverent
toward medical education or
oblivious to the immeasurable
contributions physicians make to
society, but I confess neverthe-
less how nonplussed I was by the
strange headline in the Sept. 14
issue of the University Times,
“Med school prof named to
nation’s ﬁrst chair focusing on
patient care” (page 4). A special
chair, I wondered? A chair?
Focusing on patient care? My
old—fashioned view of medicine
is that all physicians should fo-
cus on patient care, that medical
students across the board, in all
medical specialties, are indoctri-
nated in patient care. VVhy, then,
did Arthur S. Levine, senior vice
chancellor for Health Sciences
and medical school dean, in an
adjoining story, gush and bust
his britches over this chair, de-
scribing it as “a national mile-
stone in ‘bringing long overdue
attention to the doctor-patient
relationship. as the very soul of
the medical profession”?

_ First of all, is not the “doctor-
patient relationship” at the very
core, conventionally speaking,
and never mind a Vauntedchair,
of a physician’s medical prac-
tice? Next, since when is medi-
cine characterized with the word
soul? I thought that medicine

   
  as

was about bodies, not about souls,
the soul being the province of
theology, the clergy, or of pasto-
ral psychology. But leave that
be, a digression I could not resist
including in this letter, my main
purpose being to ask why the
doctor-patient relationship is
such a special alliance as to war-
rant its elevation, pedagogically
speaking, to the level of chair.
If a chair in patient care is
merited, then why not in arts
and sciences a chair in teaching,
or in engineering a chair in build-
ing safe highways, or in physics a
chair in matter that matters, or
in biology a chair in life, or in
mathematics a chair in numbers
that add up, or in business edu-
cation a chair in achieving prof-
itability, or in theology a chair in
faith?

rperloff@katz.pitt.edu

Arthur S. Levine, senior vice chan-
cellor for Health Sciences and dean
of the School of Medicine, responds:

Professor Perloff is quite cor-
rect that the doctor-patient rela-
tionship is what medicine is
about. However, there are a num-
ber of signiﬁcant aspects of this

    

relationship that have not been

illuminated, brought into focus, '

and studied analytically. For ex-
ample, young physicians dealing
with patients who are dying not
uncommonly react with anxiety,
denial, depression,identiﬁcation
and even anger. The psychologi-

cal transactions between the pa—_

tient, the patient’s family and
the doctor that provoke these
unproductive feelings in the phy-
sician are as much a substrate for

scholarship as any subject in 1

medicine, and perhaps more so
— given Professor Perloff’ s state-
ment that the doctor-patient re-

lationship is “at the very core of

a physician’s medical practice.”
With the emergence of man-
aged care, and the constraints on
a physician’s time arising in the
wake of this dramatic evolution
in health care ﬁnancing, it be-
comes increasingly important to
explore the doctor-patient rela-
tionship in a social, cultural, po-
litical, psychological and eco-
nomic context. Professor Perloff
has trivialized a scholarly topic
of great seriousness and impor-
tance which, fortunately, the
family of Dr. Leo Criep, which
endowed this unique chair, was
able to view with greater per-
spective and profundity.

building and running the center.
He was wonderfully effective in
working with faculty and he was
a great recruiter. He identiﬁed
and trained many of the talented
researchers now working at
UCSUR,” Schulz said.

“He was also a very effective
manager, with the rare gift of
being gentle yet ﬁrm and getting
the best job performances out of
people. Steve was a wonderful
sounding board, too. My inter-
actions with him were always
therapeutic because he provided
a sense of perspective, direction
and enthusiasm about whatever
challenges we were facing.”

Vijai Singh, Pitt associate
chancellor and former UCSUR
director, called Manners an ex-

cellent survey researcher and -

manager of large databases, who
also demonstrated great people
skills.

“He had this extraordinary
ability to get people to collabo-
rate on interdisciplinary projects,
basically by showing them. that

working together was in their
_ own best interests,” Sing_h said.

Manners negotiated with
funding agencies and lobbied for
money to hire undergraduate
students towork on UCSUR
projects. “He wanted under-

graduates to have the opportu-

nity to gain research experience

while getting paid for it,” .Singh
said. .

“But never did Steve request
anything for himself,” Singh
added.<“Given all that he was
doing for thevcenter, he could
have asked for higher pay_or perks
like more money for travel, but
he didn’t.”

Manners was a positive per-
son who never complained about
anything — including his own
health problems, said Singh and
Schulz, who worked with Man-
ners for 22 and 17 years, respec-
tively, but learned only recently
that Manners was diabetic.

“The University has lost a
gem of a guy. Personally, I’ve
lost one of my best friends,”
Singh said. '

Manners earneda B.S_. in bio-
logical sciences and chemistry
from Pitt in 1973 and did post-
baccalaureate studies in com-
puter science here between 1974
and 1976 before earning an M.S.
in radiation health physics from
Pitt in 1980.

He issurvived by his wife,
Barbara Manners, and a sister,
Katherine Manners, of Oakland.

UNIVERSITY SEI\lATE

 
M A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

The topic today is compensation, more spe-
ciﬁcally salary levels and salary increase policy.
There were at least two prompts for this: one was
a discussion at the Sept. 12 University Senate
Council meeting; the other was a conversation I
had with afaculty member in July."

At the Senate Council meeting, Professor
Phil Wion and the chancellor disagreed about
interpretation of University salary increase policy.

 

ments and individual merit. The difference between their inter-
pretations of the policy was on whether maintenance of real
salary is primary among the four elements. If it is, all employees
performing satisfactorily are entitled to receive increases that
match the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during
the preceding year, absent unusual circumstances, before funds
are assigned from the salary'inc~rease pool to the other elements.

The chancellor’s view is thatsalary maintenance is just one of
four elements, and he may determine how the funds in the salary

increase pool will be allocated among those elements.

It occurred to me that a policy on yearly salary increases must
take into account the effect on the recipients of an increase below
the CPI, when their performance has been rated as satisfactory.
Individuals who believe their real salary has been diminished by
an increase below the CPI, even though performance has been
rated satisfactory, will be disappo_inted and disaffected, particu-
larly if failure to meet the CPI occurs with some frequency.
Some may respond by lessening their commitment to their jobs
and the University in ways that may adversely affect University
objectives._ Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when inﬂation
was quite high, the University’s position was that, because of the
high rate of inﬂation (in 1980 the CPI rose 13.5 percent), it _was
not possible to maintain real salary. I ﬁnd it somewhat inconsis-

‘ tent for the University now, given the positive reports, about
fundraising, and a CPI of only 2.7 percent-, to decline to match
the CPI in awarding salary increases to employees who per-
formed satisfactorily. If the CPI is not matched when the CPI is
high, why is it not matched when it is at one of the lowest levels
in history, absent a depression? Matching the CPI in awarding

’ salary increases for satisfactory performance has important sym-

rily to regressiﬁnancially‘. ' ’ H  I W"   ’

A The conversation with the faculty member in July turned at
some point to the subject of faculty donating to the University,
sparked in part by an update from the chancellor indicating the
success of fundraising during the past year and the hopes for the
future. The faculty member I was speaking with said he did not
make contributions to the University because he feels he is
making a contribution by accepting a lower salary than he could
obtain at a research institute.or some other organization.

This raised in my mind the issue of whether the University
has clear goals for University faculty salaries. From what I can
tell, the goal is tohave average faculty salaries at the median level
for AAU institutions or, more likely, at the median level for AAU
public institutions. Some document should clearly state the goal,
if one indeed exists. Faculty -salaries at Pitt do not reach either
level now, except for a small number of facultyin a few disciplines
and schools. Some long—time faculty are told by their chairper-
sons that they are seriously underpaid, but that the amount of
money available for equity adjustments is too small to make up
substantially for lengthy prior periods of inadequate salary
increases. While it is heartwarming to’ have conﬁrmation of
one’s worth, it is transitory. Salary increases are not transitory;
an increase one year raises the base on which percentage in-
creases are awarded in subsequent years. 0

Should the difference between faculty compensation and
what faculty compensation would be if the “median goal” were
met be viewed as an in-kind faculty contribution to Pitt? I doubt
that the University management has ever given thought to this
notion. When the average faculty salary is below the target for
a faculty rank, one could reasonably conclude that, collectively,
the faculty at that rank has made an in-kind contribution.

While there is evidence that manyfactors, apart from com-
pensation, are relevant to employee job satisfaction, the impor-
tance of compensation cannot be denied. Apart from the psycho-
logical effect of salary increases below the CPI on a regular basis
for satisfactory performance, ﬁnancial hardship for some faculty

some faculty members to seek opportunities for compensation to
increase their incomes. The choices made to garner additional
income may come at the expense of theircommitment to the
University, particularly to students.

Awhile backl attended the dinner celebrating the 50 years of
teaching by School of Law Emeritus Dean W. Edward Sell. For
me, the most important statement in his remarks was that in his
50 years of teaching he never missed or canceled a class in the
interest of personal pecuniary. beneﬁt. How many faculty can
make such a statement about their commitment and priorities?
University salary policy should have as one of its goals inspiring
commitment like that of Dean Sell. The symbolic value of real

salary maintenance should not be overlooked in this context. I

Yearly salary increases take into consideration four elements: .

ofﬁcials in an employee discrimi-

nation lawsuit has until Oct. 23?

to ﬁle further briefs. In "response
to the allegations, lawyers for
the Pitt ofﬁcials entered a mo-
tion to dismiss all charges against
them. 0

Chiquita Lanier ﬁled suit
against the University and sev-
eral Pitt officials in U.S. District
Court for Western Pennsylva-
nia last spring, charging Pitt with
racial, age and appearance-re-
lated discrimination in its hiring
and promotion practices.

Lanier, employed at Pitt since
1980 in the division of Facilities
Management, alleges that ofﬁ-
cials in her department repeat-

edly passed her over for promo-

tion, denied her requests for
training, maintained a pay dis-
parity based on race and favored,

in promotion and hiring deci-
sions, younger, white employees
with less experience. She further-
alleges a pattern of racial and age

discrimination in the Facilities "

Management division.

In addition to the University,
the suit names as defendants: Pitt
Board of Trustees chairman J.
Wray, Connolly; Chancellor
Mark A. N ordenberg; Executive
Vice Chancellor Jerome
Cochran; Provost James V.
Maher; Human Resources Asso-

ciate Vice Chancellor Ronald,

Frisch and Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor John Greeno; and Facili-
ties Management Associate Vice
Chancellor Ana M. Guzman and
department directorsJoseph W.
Fink,John A. Sopcisak and Lewis
H. Brower.

Ofﬁcials in Pitt’s Ofﬁce of

' General Counsel declined com-

ment on the lawsuit, referring
the University Times to Ken

Service, director of News and
Information. Service said, “The

,University itself has. not been

servedwith any complaint. Gen-
eral Counsel has ﬁled a motion
to dismiss the case on behalf of
all the individuals who are
named.” '

The’51 year-old Lanier, who
is black, alleges in her civil suit
that Pitt ofﬁcials have ‘disre-
garded policies governing dis-
crimination resulting in “unde-
served demotions, undesirable
reassignmen_ts -... refusal to pro-
mote, [and] unequal pay [caus-

ing] an extremely hostile and ,

stressful working environment.”
She claims the University is
in violation of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act, the Age Dis-'
crimination in Employment Act,
the PA Human Relations Act
and the Fair Labor Standards
Act. A
Lanier wasrhired by Facilities

Management (then called Physi-
cal Plant) in April 1980 as an
administrative aide. Her job titles
included staff specialist II and
administrative secretary to the
director of operations and main-
tenance. Her current title is ad-
ministrative support staff III to

the division’s senior coordinator 0

of workcontrol.
According to,Federal Court

I documents, Lanier ﬁled a com-
plaint with theEqual Employ-.a

ment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) in March 1999. The
EEOC issued a “right to sue”

letter in March 2000.

Lanier ﬁled the lawsuit in fed-
eral court last May. In August,
she ﬁled an amendedtcomplaint
with the court providing a chro-
nology of alleged discriminatory
incidents dating back to 1981.

This September, University
attorneys ﬁled the motion to dis-

. miss all charges against the indi-

viduals in response to the
amended complaint.

In that motion, Pitt main-
tains the suit should be dismissed
“on a multitude of grounds, in-
cluding the inability to state a
claim as against individual de-

fendants, the failure to exhaust
administrative remedies, and
defective service of process to
non-ofﬁcer individual defen-
dants.” V '

Pitt further contends that
Lanier’s amended complaint
contains allegations not previ-
ously raised in her" May 2000
legal ﬁling,.that it’ attempts to
assert claims on behalf of other
individuals she does not repre-
sent and that it fails to comply
with applicable rules ofpleading
in a civil suit. /'

Lanier has ﬁled the civil suit
“pro se” (without a representing
attorney) and has requested a
jury trial. She seeks compensa-
tory and punitive damages to be
determined by the Federal
Court.

According to a U.S. District
Court ofﬁcial, Lanier has until
Oct. 23 to ﬁle documents in re-
sponse to Pitt’s motion to dis-
miss. The federal civil division
magistrate, Judge Kenneth
Benson, ~will rule on the
University’s dismissal motion
after the Oct. 23 deadline, the
court ofﬁcial said.

ployee enrolled in the POS plan
and self-referred (did not use a
primary care physician) the two
plans provided identical cover-

age. During orientation sessions

held this spring, UPMC ofﬁcials
freely admitted that there was no
difference in coverage. Appar-
ently the comprehensive cover-

. agevwas offered becauseof a

University requirement that a
fee-for—service health plan be
offered. J - 0 _

If the POS plan offers cover-
age identical to comprehensive
but at a lower cost, why did 170+

employees choose the more ex— -

pensive coverage? In early spring
I phoned Human Resources to

express my concern that un—‘

knowledgeable employees would
select comprehensive coverage
and in effect overpay for health
insurance. Iwas assured that all
employees selecting comprehen-
sive would be contacted and dis-
suaded from that selection.\If all
employees were contacted, why
did over 170 choose to overpay?

I asked one colleague who se-
lected comprehensive about con-
tacts from Human Resources
regarding that choice. He does

not recallariy'cioi1't'act'. I estimate P

that these 170+ University em-
ployees will overpay for health
insurance by more than
$100,000. Doesn’t the Ofﬁce of
Human Resources have an obli-
gation to minimize health-c_are_
costs for University employees?
How hard did HR try to explain
the problem to employees? A
detailed explanation seems called
for.
Joel‘ Falk
Professor and Chairman
Department of
Electrical Engineering

Ronald W Frisch, associate vice
chancellor ﬁor Human Resources,
responds? "

I want to alleviate any confu-
sion that may arise as a result of
Professor Falk’s letter to the
University Times, and I trust
the followingpwill do just that.

Let me ﬁrst say that with ‘over
12,000 University of Pittsburgh’

subscribers to the UPMC Health
Plan, thousands have been served
and are very satisﬁed.

« It is correct that the compre-
hensive plan offered by UPMC
Health Plan is the same as the
self—referred/out—of—network
option of the point—of-service

plan. One of the primary objec— ii
tives of the University’s faculty S

and staff medical advisory com-
mittee was to offer"‘choice” to

eligible faculty and staff. Profes- ,

sor Falk-may recall that both the
Faculty Assembly and Senate
Council strongly recommended
that the University administra-
tion should always offer an “in-
demnity” plan. (The compre-
hensive plan is an indemnity
plan.) ’

VVhy Professor Falk is chal-
lenging the method in which the

Universitycommunicatedinfor—
mation to faculty and staff mem-
bers about the two plans con-
cerns me. The enrollment ma-
terial, mailed to all eligible fac-
ulty and staff, deﬁnitively out-
lined the design ofthetwo health
plans. We took particular care
this year to design information
charts that clearly explained the
available coverage within each

plan as well as the associated.

employee premiums —— the self-
referred/out—of—network/point-
of-service coverage and the com-
prehensive coverage were shown
side by sideto allow for easy
comparison. Throughout the
months of April and May, the
staff of the Beneﬁts department
as well the UPMC Health Plan
"conducted numerous educa-
tional sessions where these two
plans were discussed.
Furthermore, at the recom-
mendation of the beneﬁts and
-welfare committee of the Uni-
versity Senate, the Beneﬁts of-
ﬁc‘e designed a question-and-

-answer brochure, including a

clear explanation of the two lev-
els of coverage within the point-
of—service plan. That brochure,
with an accompanying memo,
was sent to all medical plan—eli—
gible faculty and staff on March
3, 2000. Upon receipt of enroll-
ment forms, during the open
enrollment period, the staff of
the Beneﬁts ofﬁce attempted to
call those subscribers who chose
the comprehensive plan to verify
the selection before processing.

Although they attempted to ‘

speak directly-to the faculty or

staff member, they were not suc-

cessful in reaching all subscrib-

ers. Frankly, I think we have a ‘

success on our hands. Last year,
over 700 subscribers elected the
Highmark comprehensive plan.
Even at that time, Highmark’s
comprehensive and self—re-
ferred/out—of-network/point-of-
service plans were very similar.
With the University’s aggres-
sive education campaign,‘ there
are only, as Professor Falk has
indicated, less than 3 percent (just

over 140 subscribers) who have
opted for the higher cost com-
prehensive plan. At the same
time, choice among different

° plans prevails. Annually, eligible

faculty and staff have the option,
during the open enrollment pe-
riod, to change their health care

J plan if they wish.

’ On behalf of the 120 doctors
in Premier Medical and Alliance
Medical practice groups, and the

approximately 1,000 Pitt em-
ployees and their dependents '

who receive care from these doc-
tors, I want to express my appre-

. ciation to Nathan Hershey and

several Pitt faculty members who
championed continued access to
these doctors. Continuity of
treatment from doctors in whom
these patients have great conﬁ-
dence is very important.

I do want to take exception,
however, to one point inJerome
Cochran’s letter in your Sept. 2 8

major impediment to pro-

“negotiations” were required
over the summer months to bring

clusion in early September.

tients who according to our

records might be affected. On V
June 28, 2000, we provided —=

sources, said that Pitt had re-

ceived notiﬁcation of the signed

agreement between the two

health insurers that day.

Under the contract adden-
dum, about 1,000 UPMC Health
Plan subscribers at Pitt (approxi-
mately 600 employees and their
covered dependents) are eligible
to use doctors in Highmark’s
Alliance Ventures/Premier

practice groups —— about 120
physicians in all —- if they were
patients of the physicians be-

tweenJuly 1, 1999, andJune 30, ‘

2000. (See University Times, Sept.
14. ) s

Pitt’s contract with
Highmark expired June 30. On
July 1, a three—year, sole—pro—
vider deal with UPMC Health
Plan went into effect. The con-
tract limited Pitt health care sub-
scriber optionsto UPMC Health
Plan selections. -

But Highmark officials
agreed with UPMC Health Plan
ofﬁcials to allow Pitt patients
and their covered dependents to

continue seeing Highmark phy-
sicians in the two designated
medical practice groups. -

Spokespersons for UPMC
Health Plan and the Highmark
medical practice groups con-
ﬁrmed the agreement.

Frisch said that while the
amendment has not been ex-
tended for the life of the three-
year Pitt-UPMC Health Plan
contract, he is optimistic that
such _an extension will be reached.
He said that on Sept. 13, repre-
sentatives of the two sides got
together with him and other Pitt
ofﬁcials and reached an under-
standing. “I believe Lee Bowser

[chief operating ofﬁcer of the -

Highmark medical practice

groups] is personally committed

[to extend this] for the life of our
contract with UPMC Health
Plan,” Frisch said.

Attempts to work out such an
amendment have prompted
charges in recent weeks as to
which side was delaying a settle-
ment. Senate President Hershey

according to his information, the
two insurers had reached a ver-
bal agreement on this amend-
ment onJune 16. He said that by
mid—August, frustrated with what
appeared to him to be an im-
passe, he "took “matters into my

own hands as best I could.” (See

Sept. 1 4 University Times. )*
“Now, it may be that Pitt was
negotiating; with the UPMC
[Health Plan] p.eople to get them
to negotiate with Highmark, but
to the best of my knowledge there
were no negotiations between
UPMC [Health Plan] and
Highmark during this time,”

‘Hershey told Faculty Assembly.

Jerome Cochran, executive
vice chancellor, said in a Sept. 28
letter to the University Times
that the “major impediment to
progress” was Highmark.

OCTOBER 12, 2000 a

Conservative Novak picks Bush   Eh,  
  . , . - . U‘
as election s winner, but has httle     , .  
enthusiasm for either presidential candidate

eferring to the presi-
dential candidates in
both major parties as
“charismatically challenged,” a
national syndicated columnist
and CNN political commenta-
tor critiqued this year’s national
election. ,

Robert Novak, co—host of
CNN’s “Crossﬁre” program,
spoke on the major issues in the
presidential election as part of
Pitt’s American Experience dis-

tinguished lecture series. ‘The I

series, presented by the Univer-
sity Hqnors College with sup-
port from the Graduate School.
of Public and International Af-
_fairs, bi—annually invites national

ﬁgures to the Pittsburgh campus

for an address and question—and—

answer session. _

Cyril H. Wecht, Allegheny
County coroner and former
county commissioner, and Rob-
ert G. Hazo, American Experi-
ence program director, served as

, questioners following Novak’s

Oct. 4 lecture. .
An avowed political conser-

vative, Novak told the audience

that “government, especially at

the federal level, is the problem,
not the solution.” He said his

favorite presidents of the 20th
centurywere Ronald Reagan’ and
Calvin Coolidge, the only two
who really believed in limited
government.

“It’s the power of the presi-
dency that worries me,” Novak
said, “not the people we choose
to serve,” ﬂawed though they
may be. For example, he said,
the U.S, makes military deci-
sions based on national security.
“Well, the national interest of

the U.S. is whatever the presi-'

dent says it is. We use force one
that principle. Congress is sup-

. posed to have sole power to de-

clare war, but it’s the president
who has waged. the last several
wars.” ‘

Novak has covered the past
22 major party conventions over
the course of 1 1 presidential races
as a political journalist and com-
mentator. He said common to
every national election season is
that, after the conventions, vot-
ers askzi Are these really the best
two candidates? They also ask:
VVhat’s the difference; aren’t they
just Tweedledee and Tweedle-
dum?

“Those of you who came to
hear me bash Al Gore are going

_ to the bitterly disappointed. In

fact, I worship the quicksandAl

.Gore is standing in,” Novak

quipped. A .
“I’ve known Al Gore since he

“I was 12 yearsold. His father, Sen.

Al Gore Sr., invited me over to
dinner where they lived in Wash-
ington, at the Ritz Carlton Ho-

. tel. Well, I can tell you, very few

populists make their home at the

Ritz Carlton,” ’ Novak said, re-

ferring to the younger Gore’s

current political posture. .
.Novak joked that candidate

Gore “studied ‘Southern’ as a

foreign language,” having grown

_ up in Washington and having

been schooled at Harvard.

’ On the national scene, Novak
said, Gore’s biggest mistake was
running for president in 1988.
“He waged one of the worst cam-
paigns in history. He was con-
sidered ﬁnished. But in one of
those funny things that happens
in politics, Clinton picked him
as vice president, saved his ca-

reer, and essentially designated '

him heir, anointed the succes-
sor ” '

tion this year was. _a foregone

conclusion given the poor po- , .

litical strategy of his only real

challenger, former Sen. Bill Bra-

dley. “Famous ex—basketball
player Bill Bradley, mixing up

his sports, played ‘rope-a-dope,’ '

and let Gore continually punch
him while he took it.”

Novak said Republicans have
a tradition of picking the candi-
date by “whose turn it is,” disre-

igarding qualifications and

electibility. Candidates who were
also-rans in prior years are moved
up a notch. .“They picked
Reagan, because it was Reagan’s
turn; they -picked [President]
George Bush, because it was his

turn". Bob Dole, I think is a great ' if

American. But a lousy candidate.
They picked him. Why? It was
Dole’s turn.” I

And Gov. Bush? “Well, they
didn’t. have anyone. So, they
picked someone with the same
name as someone who’s turn it
[used to be]. Republican leaders
got together and plunked down

$100 million and designated

Bush as the candidate.” .

But, Novak maintained, the
two candidates are nothing alike,
personally or politically. “In fact,
it’s about as clear a choice as ever
this year. I was pleasantly sur-

prised by the [Oct. 3 presiden-
tial] debate. It was not exciting, _P

but they were debating in a seri-

ous way, serious issues, includ-

ing social security.” .
Novak said the one overrid-
ing issue in this campaign is what
toedo with the surplus, which is a
newissue to recent political cam-
paigns, given the chronic gov-
ernment deﬁcits. “Asurplusjust

_ means more money coming in

than going out. The Congres-
sional Budget Ofﬁce projects_ a
$5 5 0 trillion surplus over the next

* 10 years. VVhat should be done

with that money? Build new gov-

ernment programs or reduce.
- , Would overturning Roe v. Wade

taxes?”
Novak said Gore -has pro-

I posed some tax cuts, but only for

those who “need it,” meaning
people who qualify under-spe-
ciﬁc government programs he
favors, like those attending col-
lege or using daycare.

“He’s correct when he says
Bush wants to give about 40 per-
cent of the tax cuts to 1 percent
of the people‘. VVhy? They paid
40 percentof the taxes to begin
with, that’s why! Because it’s
fair.”

If the election were held
  at the time of the Pitt
lecture, Novak predicted,
Bush would win narrowly,
the Democrats would
re-capture a small
majority in the House of
Representatives and the
Republicans would keep .
  their small majority in th

pump money into federal pro-
grams under the mistaken belief

_thatgthe government can fix

whatever’s ‘ wrong, N ovak said.
“Of course they call it ‘invest-

. me‘nt,”’ he said. “VVhat Gore re— ,

allywants is a redistribution of
wealth. ~

“Bush says, give it back to the
people, all of whom are over-
taxed. ‘

“The most productive in this
society should get the most tax
cut. The rich will invest. Others,
the poor, the middle class,
won’t.”

In fact, Novak proposed do-
ing. away with federal income
taxes entirely in favor of a na-

' tional sales tax. “We need to talk

about tax reform, not just tax
reduction. We need a different
tax system, but nobody wants to
talk about that.”

A second clear—cut difference
between the two candidates is
their potential appointees to the
Supreme Court. “Bush clearly
would appoint judges to the Sn-
preme Court that would over-

_turn Roe v. Wade, though he

won’t say that. And Gore clearly
has Roe v. Wade as a litmus test
for the judges he would appoint.

would just beturned over to the
states. New York, New Jersey
would still have it. Would Penn-
sylvania? Well, we just don’t
know, do we?” V
At least three justices will be
appointed to the Supreme Court

- by the next president, N ovak said.

“The real danger is the overall
role the court plays. The court
was not meant to legislate; it was
designed to adjudicate. The way
things are now, Thomas

Democrats traditionally“

Jefferson is revolving in his
grave.” .

Democrats traditionally pick
safe Supreme Court judges,
Novak said. “The Republicans
have no idea what they’re doing
[as evidenced by President]
Bush’s selection of David Souter,

- the most liberal judge on the

bench.”

The role of the military after
the Cold War is an uncharted
issue like having a surplus, and

«neither candidate is well—quali—

ﬁed to make decisions. “Bush
doesn’t know what to do, and

Gore obfuscates on the issue,”

N ovak said.

The lecturer also said that
education is an overemphasized
issue in the national campaign.
“I keep a copy of the U.S. Con-
stitution on my dresser’ for when
I can’t sleep. And the federal
government has no duties to-

ward education,not even in in—.
visible ink;_ it’s a state and’ local ,

function,” he said.

“Education really is a ‘soft
issue.’ The only time it becomes
importantis when the economy
is okay and there’s, no war, which
is what we have now.”

- Novak’ said the issues he
would like to see addressed,
which so far havebeen ignored,
include tax reform, racial quotas
and school vouchers. “And I’d
like to see term limits discussed,
which has been surgically re-
moved as an issue from the Re-
publican platform, even though
most Americans think it’s a good
idea.” _

Another theme common to
every presidential election is

- hearing the candidates say, “This

is the most important election of
your lifetime.”
“Well, it isn’t,” N ovak said.

/

“It’s not important, except for
the politicians.-You’re safe, no
matter who wins. Even the los-

"ers are safe in this society. That’s

why there are no revolutions.”

I q Novak maintained that the
U.S. Constitution purposefully
limits the power of the federal
government. “Over 2 00 years ago

’ at the other end of this state the

founding fathers wrote the Con-
stitution in a mood of detesta-
tion of government. They de-
signed a system intended not to
work. And they did a pretty good
job of it, too! It’s so hard to get
anything passed. It’s frustrating
for both sides.”

As an example, Novak said,~it
now takes 60 votes in the Senate
to pass any legislation, practi-
cally speaking. “Forget the
simple majority; the formerly
little—used filibuster is now
dragged out with suchasegularity

I that nothing can get passed with-

out 60 votes.”

» Novak hedged about predict-
ing the outcome of the election,
but relented when pressed on
the question. 

He said if the ‘election were
held at‘ the time of the lecture,

Bush would win narrowly, the ‘

Democrats would re-capture a
small majority in the House of
Representatives and the Repub-
licans would keep their small
majority in the Senate.

Novak said about 90 percent
of voters had already made up
their minds and the race was a
virtual dead heat. “But what are
the other 10 percent looking at?
Do you think it’s the surplus? Is
it social security? Education? N o,
they’re looking at it like a job
interview, a beauty contest, I’m
sad‘ to say.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Older computers are revamped,
recycled, recirculated before they
end up in Pitt’s Surplus Property

t’s an environmental night-

mare: tons of obsolete, non-

biodegradable computer
equipment being dumped into
landﬁlls. .

But that’s not how the Uni-
versity deals with its own out-
moded computers, according to
Pitt information technology staff
and the manager of the
University’s Surplus Property
ofﬁce.

Surplus Property, located at
400 N. Lexington Ave. in Point
Breeze, is where Pitt’s old com-
puters go to die — or, more
often, to be reborn for resale to
departments and individual staff,
faculty members and students.

The warehouse-like. facility
receives, on average, 500 com-
puters and accessories annually
but discards few of them, said
manager Tom Heidkamp.

“Most ofthe equipment ﬁnds
a home,” he said. “There have
been instances where we had to
throw out broken monitors, but
the newer monitors can be re-
paired, so there is a market for
them.” _

As computer equipment ar-
rives at Surplus Property,
Heidkamp’s staff sorts and evalu-

. ates it, rebuilding computers by

combining parts and pieces from

‘ multiple systems:

“Our first approach is to of-
fer these computers and acces-
sories to the University commu-
nity,” Heidkamp said. “If that
fails, we have recycling and re-
sale companies as well as non-
proﬁt community groups look-
ing for used systems.”

‘Computers, like other Pitt
surplus equipment, are offered
for sale to departments for 45
days after the equipment has been
entered in the University’s recy-
cling program. Then it’s avail-
able for sale to individual stu-
dents and employees for an ad-
ditional 45 days. After the total
90 days, surplus equipment may
be sold to the general public.

Faculty, staff and students
with valid Pitt ID cards may shop
at Surplus Property for used
computers as well as surplus
desks, chairs, ﬁling cabinets —
even cars and vans, during Sur-

plus Property’s annual auction.

buy a used computer with a basic
operating system (software not
included) plus a laser printer,
machines that are ﬁne for simple
tasks such as word processing.

“We’re talking about equip-
ment that sold for maybe $2,000
ﬁve years ago,” Heidkamp said.
“We sell it ‘as is,’ with no war-
ranties, but we’ll let you plug it
in and try it out here before you
buy it.”

The amount of Pitt computer
equipment that ends up at Sur—
plus Property has decreased
slightly in recent years, accord-
ing to Heidkamp.

“Five years ago, a system was
outdated a month or two after it
was purchased and systems were
upgraded in a short time. With

the newer pentium systems, de-
partments are upgrading some
of their computers rather than
purchasing new ones,”
Heidkamp said. i

The increasing popularity of
laptops is another factor. “We
receive very few laptop comput-
ers,” he said. “Mainly because of
their size, departments tendito
ﬁnd a place to store them, rather
than turning them in to us.”

CI

Under Pitt’s Surplus Equip-
ment Recycling and Disposal
policy (University policy 10-06-
04), designated staff in each de-
partment are responsible for
identifying, and turning over to
Surplus Property, equipment
that is judged to be obsolete,
worn—out, no longer needed or

‘too expensive to maintain.

Each unit largely determines
for itself how to maximize its
computers’ lifespans. »

The Katz Graduate School
of Business, for example, seldom
buys new computersfor its staff,
said Frank Miller, the school’s
director of information technol-
ogy.
“VVhat we do is buy new ma-
chines for our faculty, who ‘use
computers for research as well as
e-mail and word processing;
VVhen these machines become
outmoded within two or three
years, they are still plenty strong
enough for a staff desk,” he said.

Like other schools, Katz up-
grades and cannibalizes machines
to prolong their usefulness. “To—
day, you canspend $500 to in-
stall a new processor that will
make an older machine as good

as a new, $2,000 machine,” Miller ‘

said.-

‘When computers are no
longer powerful enough for Katz
faculty and staff, the machines
are placed in Ph.D. students’ of-
ﬁces. “That's not giving them to
the students,” Miller noted.
“That’s making them available
to students for use within the
building, to get another six
months’-to—a-year’s use out of
these computers before we send
them to Surplus Property.”

By the time Katz does send
its old computers to Surplus
Property, the machines’ shells
‘and power supplies sometimes
are the only original parts re-
,maining.

“I have no qualms whatso- I

ever about getting rid of those
machines,” Miller said. “The
most beneﬁt they would be to us
would be as doorstops.”

Unlikeian individual school
or department, the University
Library System (ULS) serves the
whole Pitt community and must
maintain the latest generations
(or close to them) of hardware
and software.

ULS replaces it approxi-
mately 300 PCs — halffor use by
the public, the other 15 0 for ULS

personnel — every three years,‘

said Timothy S. Deliyannides,
head ofthe system’s information
systems department.

“A lot of the client software

that we use for accessing data-
bases has pretty rigorous hard-
ware requirements,” he said.
“We have to keep our comput-
ers up to date so that students
and faculty can access the data-
bases they need.”

Rather than send its old PCs

automatically to Surplus Prop.-*

erty, ULS hands some of them
over (in exchange for a budget-
ary reimbursement) to units that
are only too happy to adopt
ULS’s castoffs.

Several arts and sciences de-
partments have acquired former
ULS machines in recent years,
Deliyannides said.

' The College of General Stud-
ies employs a systems analyst to
preserve spare computer parts
for _use in new equipment“. Re-
cently, the college donateda half-
dozen computers to a program

that helps the unemployed ﬁnd

work.

“They may just need to learn
EXCEL or do word processing
to update their resume. We do-
nated the computers that were
not upgraded enough for our
internal systems,” said Joanne
Rosol, the college’s manager of
information evaluation and as-
sessment.

' Colleen Scholl, an adminis-
trative secretary in the "School of
Social Work, said the school
upgrades its computers year-
round. “We take a request, see if
the budget allows, and then or-
der new equipment or software
as needed,” Scholl said. “VVhen
machines are at their lowest end,
they are sent to the Surplus Prop-
erty warehouse.” 4

Richard Colwell, an elec--
tronic specialist III in the School
of Engineering, said he salvages
parts as much as possible for the
repair of existing computers be-
fore giving outmoded comput-
ers to Surplus Property.

Education school Dean Alan
Lesgold said, “We don’t keep
many computers of a generation
not made to handle networks.
There are actually a couple of
old 286s around the school, but
they’re okay for transcribing
taped material.

“You ﬁgure if there’s an ini-
tial investment of $1,800 for a
computer and standard software,
you have to factor in your bud-
get an equal amount each year
for maintenance and support,”

_ Lesgold added.

“So you’re got three, four or
ﬁve times the cost of the invest-
ment for maintaining a computer
over,say, ﬁve years. Then there’s
a decision: Is it worth it to con-
tinue this, or should we buy a
new one?” «

VVhile University policy re-
quires units to turnin old com-

puting equipment to Surplus

Property, regardless of how ob-
solete or beaten up it may be, at
least one Pitt. ‘school simply

original machine, but the Sur— ,

plus Property people don’t want
that stuff. It’s garbage for them,
too,” said the school’s informa-
tion technician, who asked that
he and his school not be identi-
ﬁed.

Surplus Property manager
Heidkamp disagreed. “We pre-
fer that all departments call or e-
mail us prior to disposing of any
surplus equipment or furniture,”
he said.

“Bib” DeLucia’s memory will
live on through anewly estab-
lished scholarship at Pitt’s Brad-
ford campus.

DeLucia’s brothers, I Elmer
and Augie, with help from area
veterans, have initiated the An-
thony “Bib” DeLucia Memorial
Scholarship, which will beneﬁt
undergraduate students.

Augie DeLucia is ‘a retired
Bradford campus employee.

“We truly appreciate that the
DeLucias have chosen to con-
tinue their brother’s legacy with
a scholarship at Pitt-Bradford,”
said campus President Richard
E. McDowell. “This scholarship
is a ﬁtting and‘-‘lasting way to
honor a hometown hero while

port to future Pitt-Bradford stu--

I dents.”

Bib D,eLucia was a staff ser-
geant with the U.S. Army Air

Corp during World War II. He '

was one of 10 crew members
aboard a B-24 Liberator when it
crashed intoia South China

. mountainside in 1944.

The remains of the crew and
wreckage from the plane went
untouched for 52 years until two

Chinese farmers came upon the ,

crash site. After his remains were
recovered, DeLucia was buried
in St. Bernard Cemetery in Brad-
ford. .

The initial contribution of
$2,000 to the DeLucia Memo-
rial Scholarship came from do-

New scholarship established on Bradford campus

nations raised by a committee of
Bradford-area veterans. A L

The goal is to raise a mini-
mum of $1 0,000 to endow a per-
manent scholarship fund at the
Bradford campus. The first
scholarship will be awarded from
earnings when the scholarsip
fund reaches this minimum en-
dowment level.

To ‘memorialize DeLucia,’ a
plaque bearing his name will be
added to the campus donor wall
of recognition. 2 .

Scholarship through the Institu-

tional Advancement Ofﬁce on-_.

OCTOBER 12, 2000

Legal case seen as possible threat
to academic freedom is explained

aculty were advised of a
potential legal threat
to the traditional con-

cept of academic freedom at last

week’s Faculty Assembly.

Pitt law professorjohn Parry
reported to the Oct. -3 assembly
on possible implications of a 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals Febru-
ary 1999 case, Uroﬁ/ey v. Gilmore.

The 4th Circuit decision de—
nied an attempt by six academi-
cians in Virginia to overturn a
state statute restricting state
employees’ use of state-owned
or —leased computer ‘equipment
to download sexually explicit

 

“matter.
The only exception the court .

allowed is if the explicit material
was part of a bona ﬁde, institu-
tion-approved research project,
where prior written approval was

I 4 granted by ofﬁcialsof the insti-

tution.

According to Parry, that de-
cision potentially means that a
state legislature could attach con-
ditions on faculty research done
by state employees. Further-
more, Parry said, universities
with an ideological bent could
restrict research by denying ap-

, provals, based on this decision.

Parry noted there is some
question, given Pitt’s state-re-
lated status, about whether Uni-
versity faculty would be consid-
ered state employees when ap-
plying type of statute. Parry

said his colleagues in the law
school advised him that Pitt’s
faculty would not be vulnerable,
but that their opinions were not
deﬁnitive.

Among the broader ramiﬁ-
cations of the decision, Parry
said, is that academic freedom

, for the individual is non-existent

as a matter of law. “Academic
freedom exists only as a matter
of-practice,” Parry said. “You

_ could get access to sexually ex-

plicit material if your dean or
department head approved it; but
that just means to me thatthe
censor is closer. If thisdecision is
[applied], it could mean that the
University could control your
research to ﬁt its mission and
vision. Academic freedom is the
University’s right, not yours,”
he told assembly members.

“I wouldn’t worry about it
necessarily,” Parry said. “I would
be concerned, but not alarmed.
There is no equivalent PA stat-
ute that I’m aware of. But it is a
signal to those who might _want
to ﬁght for restrictions. I also
think.it’s just a bad [legal] deci-
sion.”

Parry pointed out that the
court’s decision said download-
ing such explicit material at home
on a personal computer does not
violate the statute, because a pri-
vate citizen is protected by the
First Amendment, whereas a

In the suit, law professor

i .

Parry told Faculty Assembly:
“My only advice is that all of us
be proactive: Make a good case
for the value of your work and
why it’s a good thing, why it’s-
real research.”

Parry declined to handicap’

the Supreme.Court in the event
a challenge to the Virginia stat-
ute is heard there.

University Senate President
Nathan Hershey pointed out that

the courts traditionally have sup-

ported the freedom of universi-
ties to make the rules that gov-
ern certain actions within their
purview. A student may be ex-

pelled, for example, for violating
university policy,‘without fear-
ing the courts would step in.
“This is a different situation, of
course,” Hershey said. “But it’s
the same principle in that the

_ university is exercising academic

freedom.”

A Faculty Assembly member
then suggested that this issue be
a topic for a future plenary ses-
sion, to which Hershey agreed.

In other Faculty Assembly
developments:

° The Senate’s fall plenary
session_ is scheduled for Oct. 18,
3-5 p.m., William Pitt Union
Assembly Room. The title of the
session is “Are Scholars Under
Siege? The Scholarly Commu-
nication Crisis.” Provost James
V. Maher, University Library
System director Rush G. Miller
and history professor Evelyn S.
Rawski will be presenters.

° Senate Vice President Carol
Redmond, who sits on a com-
mittee studying Pitt’s research
integrity policy, reported that
she had gathered more than 20
major suggestions on amending
the policy. Her committee is tak-
ing these under advisement, she
said, before they ﬁnalize recom-
mendations. Faculty Assembly
agreed to form aworking group

< to review the suggestions.

° George Klinzing, vice pro-
vost for Research, presented for
discussion revisions in the Cen-

tral Appe.als.Pool and Appeals
Panel guidelines,‘ the mechanism
for faculty to challenge depart-

mental promotion and tenure de— .

cisions. . »

Klinzing said some schools
have their own provost-approved
policy for electing tenured faulty
in the school to serve on appeals
panels. 

Under. the modiﬁed guide-
lines, schools without their own
policy are subject to the Central
Appeals Pool, which will be com-
posed of all ﬁill-time tenured
faculty of the schools that do not
have an approved school—level
policy. Faculty who serve on ap-
peals o_r grievance panels will be
excluded from serving on the
Central Appeals Pool for three
years.

Faculty Assembly approved
the revisions, which then were
affirmed by vote at the Senate
Council meeting Oct. 10. The
modiﬁcations will be sent to the
chancellor for ﬁnal approval.

° Hershey reported that Sen- ,

ate bylaws had been amended by
vote to allow a Graduate and
Professional StudentAssociation
member to serve on Senate
Council.

° Hershey also reported that '

he was continuing’ to schedule
faculty and Board of Trustees

members for his “take a board-

member to class” program.

a fund through which the Pitts-
burgh Foundation aids non-
profit organizations. Albert
Wishart _]r., foundation presi-
dent and CEO, said, “Today, a
growing need exits to address
system-wide challenges and op-
portunities beyond those facing
individual organizations. We
want to promote excellence
among human and community
development organizations
through information sharing,
conferences on speciﬁc topics,
targeted grant making and advo-
cacy.”

To achieve this, the Pitts-
burgh Foundation is expanding
the Copeland fund. Kearns is

Ellis chair in hematology,

oncology

established in

Pitt’s School of Medicine

The University has received

a gift from an anonymous donor .

to establish the Lawrence Ellis
Chair in Hematology and On-
cology in the School of Medi-
cine.

Donald L. Trump, chief of
the Division of Hematology —
Oncology and professor of medi~
cine and urology in the medical

school, and deputy director for

clinical investigations at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, will be the ﬁrst holder
of the Ellis chair. -

Named in honor of Lawrence
D. Ellis, a alumnus of and pro-
fessor at Pitt’s medical school,
the chair was made possible
through the generosity of a do-
nor who describes himself as “a
grateful patient,” but who pre-
fers to remain anonymous.

“We are deeply grateful to

E the donor of the Ellis chair, be-

cause his generosity will help
ensure that others will be the
beneﬁciaries of both the pioneer-
ing efforts in health care research
being carried out here at the
University of Pittsburgh and the

world class medical treatment
being provided by our medical
faculty-through the UPMC
Health System,” Pitt Chancel-
lor Mark A. Nordenberg said.

Ellis, who specializes in he-
matology and oncology, holds
the titles of professor of medi-
cine at the School of Medicine
and medical director of the
UPMC Health System Down-
town. He has contributed more
than 40 publications to the medi-
cal literature in the specialty of
hematology.

Trump is recognized as an
international authority in pros-
tate cancer and clinical evalua-
tion of new anticancer drugs.
The author or co—author of nu-
merous chapters in textbooks on

oncology, he has published more .

than 160 papers in peer reviewed
cancer journals. He alsohas re-
ceived peer reviewed funding
from the National Institutes of

‘Health, National Cancer Insti~
A tute, the American Cancer Soci-

ety, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration and the Department of
Defense. . _

Bradford campus receives

The Bradford campus has
received nearly $1 ‘million from
the estate of Alice M. Meisel, a
Pitt alumna.

Meisel’s gift of more than
$928,000 represents the largest
bequest made to Pitt-Bradford
in the history of the campus. It
also is the second largest single
gift from an individual.

“The impact ofAlice Meisel’s
philanthropic gift toward Pitt-
Bradford cannot be measured,”

. said Richard E. McDowell, Brad-

ford campus president. “Her
level of generosity, coupled with
the unexpectédness of the gift,
amazed us. Alice Meisel was a
life-long learner, and her gift to
Pitt-Bradford will carry on that
legacy.”

McDowell expects the gift
from Meisel’s estate to be used
in the-college’s Plan 2000, which
includes academic support,

a study by Pitt researchers.

The researchers, led byArma
C. Balazs of the chemical and
petroleum engineering depart-
ment, and David] asnow, chair-
person of physics and astronomy,
used two—dimensional simula-
tions to examine how the tiny
rods interacted in mixtures of
two polymers.

Their ﬁndings, published this
summer in the journal Science,
could lead to faster and easier
production, of electrically con-
ducting pathways in insulating
materials or to the creationiof
reinforcing structures in ofganic/
inorganic composites. ..

_ Researchers found that
nanotubes embedded in the poly-

mers that naturally repel one
another can align end—to-end,
creating possible electrical path-
ways in the mixture. Rodlike
nanoparticles naturally arrange
themselves into percolating net-
works that strengthen the poly-
mer blend to which they are
added. 1

“Manufacturers are already
aware that adding larger particles
to polymers can increase the
strength. Anyone with a rein-
forced "tennis racquet or auto-
mobile tires is already taking
advantage of thisphenomenon.
We’re showing that it’s possible
on the nano-scale, as,well,”
Balacz said. ._

may lower
death rate

Minimally invasive surgery
for esophagectomy (removal of
the esophagus) may reduce the
death rate associated with open
esophagectomy, according to a
study by UPMC HealthSystem
surgeons. ‘

The study was conducted
from August 1996 to September
1999 and involved 77 patients
(average age: 66) who underwent
minimally invasive procedures
for esophagectomy. The pa-

tients’ average hospital stay was .

seven days. None died.
“The results of this study
show that minimally invasive

' esophagectomy is technically

feasible and safe in a center where
surgeons have extensive experi-
ence in both minimally invasive
and openiesophagectornyf’ said
James Luketich, principal in-

Team develops
nerve. agent
detoxifier .

A disposable washcloth and
foam are the newest weapons in
the ﬁght against chemical war-
fare, using technology developed
at Pitt. .

Alan J. Russell, chairperson

. of the chemical and petroleum

engineering department, and

former graduate student Keith
E. Lejeune, have developed a

' way to use enzymes to neutralize

and identify nerve agents.
Their invention — Agentase
EnzymeF oamD2-1 —was com-
mercialized by Agentase, LLC,
where Lejeune is now chief ex-
ecutive ofﬁcer. R&D Magazine
honored Agentase Enzyme-
FoamD2—1 as one of the top 100
innovations of the year. It was

'-tested Sept. 9 at Pittsburgh’s

domestic preparedness chemi-
cal weapons ﬁeld exercise.
Russell said the invention is
faster, more effective and more
convenient than other current
and proposed methods of nerve
gas detoxiﬁcation. ‘

' Those other methods include ,

incineration, ' hypochloride

bleaching and supercritical wa-

ter (which requires submerging
contaminated‘ equipment in wa-
ter in extreme pressure and high
temperatures). .

Each method frequently de-
stroys the contaminated equip-
ment. Each also destroys the “ﬁn-
gerprint” of the nerve "agent in-
volved, making it impossible to
do post-incident forensics. ‘

Convenience is another ad-
vantage of the foam and wash-
cloth method. The other meth-
ods have onerous requirements
such as holding containers and
large amounts of bleach and wa-
ter. . - _

Also, EnzymeFoamD2-1 can

be used to decontaminate sol— -

diets and emergency workers

themselves, something that can- ~

not"be done with bleaching, in.-

cineration or supercritical wa-

ter.

Low-dose oral
contraceptives
as protective
against ovarian
cancer as
high-dose pills

Low-dose contraceptives al-
ready on the market are just as
effective as older, high—dose
preparations. in protecting
women from ovarian cancer, ac-
cording to researchers at Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH). ’

“Our study shows that women
who are taking, or have taken,
low—d'ose oral contraceptives
have a 40 percent reduction in

. risk of ovarian cancer— the same

risk reduction provided by the
older, high—dose birth control
pills,” said senior author Roberta

. Ness, associate professor of epi-

demiology at GSPH.

In addition, researchers found
that this protection begins soon
after initiating use, and contin-
ues for at least 30 years after
stopping use.

Previous research has shown“

that women taking pre— 1 980 oral‘
contraceptives were less likely to
develop ovarian cancer than were
women who had never used

‘them. But in the last two ‘de-

cades, the amounts of estrogen
and progestin in oral contracep-
tives have steadily decreased, and
new progestins have been intro-
duced. Pitt’s study is the ﬁrst
population-based, case-con-
trolled effort to examine risk pro-
tection offered by the newer
preparations. '  ‘

Provost funds project to preserve

books in ULS Special Collections

Pitt’s University Library Sys-

' tern (U LS) has initiated a project

that will preserve thousands of
at-risk books and other materi-
als; somerof which date back to

the 15th century, in its Special.

Collections department.

I ULS Director Rush Miller
has designated the use of endow-
ment income to support the
project during the—next 10 years,
preserving about 50,000 books
at a cost of more than $600,000.
The materials include books in
their original bindings from the
Darlington Library (1 8th—19th

century Americana), the Ford E. A

and Harriet R. Curtis Theatre

, Collection and the Nesbitt Col-

lection (children’s books from
the 18th century to the present).

“We are committed to take,
the necessary steps to ensure that
our rich special collections are
preserved for future generations

of scholars and students,” said v

Miller. “This procedure will al-
low these books to last for centu-
ries instead of decades.”

The ,project’s ﬁrst phase will
deacidify approximately 5,000
rare and specialized books, with
funds allocated by Provostjames

. V. Maher. 4

"The deacidiﬁcation process
will be done at Preservation
Technologies in Cranberry, the
onlymass deacidiﬁcation facility.
in I the nation. Its Bookkeeper
process, developed in 1993, neu-
tralizes the acids in paper with-
out using heat, gasses or sol-
vents. The acid in paper, accrued
through the ipapermaking pro-
cess and environmental contact,
causes book pages to become
brittle and contributes to dete-
rioration. ,

“This deacidiﬁcation effort
by the University of Pittsburgh
further supports the University’s
leadership position in preserva-
tion‘ and attests its conﬁdence
level in our ability to handle even
materials .from the Special Col-
lections,” said Dick Spatz, Pres-
ervation Technologies’ CEO
and chairman of the board. I

School of Education receives‘
$100,000 Howard Heinz grant

Pitt’s School of Education has
received a $100,000 grant from
the Howard Heinz Endowment
to establish Professional Devel-
opment Networks (PDNs) to
strengthen the link between uni-
versity coursework and the pre-
service clinical experience in the
'teach‘e'r preparation program.

The PDNs will provide -for-
malized partnerships between
Pitt’s education faculty and col-
laborating teachers‘ from local
schools to explore teaching ap-
proaches that can lead to higher
standards of performance for
pre—servioe teachers and higher
achievement standards for K-12
students} ‘ .

Naomi Zigmond, professor,
Department of Instruction and
Learning (DIL), and director of
the project, said, “Part of our
learning curve over the next few
years of this project will be to
document and understand the
changes that need to be made in
University faculty roles and re-

sponsibilities to permit DIL fac-
ulty to become actively and suc-

cessfully engaged in the Profes- .
sional Development Networks.” .

Over a three-year period, 10
networks will be established at
both the elementary and second-
ary levels. The elementary net-
works; will be organized geo=
graphically and the secondary
networks will be organized by
subject area.

Meryl K. Lazar, research as-
sistant professor, DIL, and Brad
Minnick, research associate,

DIL, have been named co-di- ‘
rectors of the PDN project.

Lazar will direct the elementary
efforts and lVIinnick, the second-
ary efforts.

Each network will consist of
approximately two University
faculty and 25 teachers. VVhen
fully developed, all feacher edu-
cation faculty will be involved, as
will about 22 5 teachers in 70

schools in 23 districts in western . .

SIS wireless information
program gets NSF grant

A project to educate a wire-
information systems
workforce, submitted by the tele-
communications program in
Pitt’s School of Information Sci-
ences (SIS), will receive an esti-
mated $391,204 grant from the
National Science Foundation
(NSF). " V ~

The grant is administered
through NSF ’s new $90 million
Information Technology Re-
search initiative. ‘

According to SIS‘ faculty
member and principal researcher
Prashant Krishnamurthy, the
project’s primary objective is to
develop and implement a wire-
less information degree track that

. provides education in the devel-

opment, design and deployment
of wireless information systems
with an emphasis on emerging

wireless data technology.
According to the NSF, these
awards are intended to spur fun-
damental research and" innova-
tive applications of information
technology. More than 200
projects were selected from over
1,400 proposals. The newly
funded activities will promote
IT~driven science and engineer-
in .
Pitt’s wireless information
systems project also has received
grants from the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania’s Link-to—Learn
program, Microsoft Corpora-
tion, and the AT&T Founda-
tion. SIS faculty members David
Tipper and Joseph Kabara are
co-investigators for the project.
