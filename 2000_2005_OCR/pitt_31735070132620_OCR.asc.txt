Researchers to clone monkey

JONATHAN CHECK
Staff Writer

Armed with monkey sperm, rhe-
sus macaque eggs and mitotic spin-
dles, the Pittsburgh Development
Center is once again monkeying
around with genetics. And as

expected, PETA is going bananas.

The National Institute of Health
recently awarded the PDC a five-
year grant of nearly $6.4 million,
money that will be used to fund the
center’s' ongoing research on the
cloning of nonhuman primates.

The money refreshes funds orig-
inally conferred for the same
research in 1998, to principal inves-
tigator Gerald Schatten, Ph.D., and
a distinguished team of colleagues
from the PDC, a center with schol-

, rigorous

arly ties to Pitt. ,

The new five-year grant period
will be marked by ambitious and
science, as the team
attempts to overcome known obsta-
cles to cloning primates.

Previous efforts to impregnate

rhesus macaque eggs thru nuclear
transfers have failed because of
inadequate configurations of the
mitotic spindle, which is critical to
the process of cellular division.

Dr. Christopher Navara, .co—
investigator of’ the project, said that
the team has hypothesized that the
process of removing DNA from the
egg damages important proteins
critical to the formation of the spin-
dle. W -
The team will need to figure out
the reason‘ that this happened in

order to succeed.

According to a press release, the
scientists have a couple of new
tricks up their sleeves to help this
time around —— tricks they hope will
allow them to overcome these
genetic barriers and successfully
clone 10 monkeys, their ideal goal.

According to Navara, the pro-
ject will utilize the service of two
or three male-monkeys, who will
donate their sperm through “a stan-
dard ejaculation procedure.”

“Fairly routine,” he added.

But Mary Beth Sweetland,
spokesperson for People for the
EthicalTreatment of Animals, said
she would not be surprised if the

Blood shortage
delays some
local operations

AMANDA SAMMONS
Staff Writer .\

Patients slated ' for elective
surgery at area hospitals have to put
off going under the knife until the
region’s blood supply increases.

Central Blood Bank, a non-
profit» organization that provides
blood to ‘hospitals throughout the
tri-state area, told hospitals
Monday to postpone elective surg-
eries until the region’s “dangerous-

Sly low” levels of O—type blood
improve. r V '

“Our hands are sort of forced to
do this,” Deborah Ervin, _a CBB
representative, said.

The delay will only apply to
elective surgeries requiring type 0
blood. Elective surgeries include
procedures , that can be delayed

,without risking the patient’s life,
such as knee surgery. '

To meet regional demand and
maintain an adequate supply of
blood, CBB requires 725 donations
a day.

“We’re not seeing anywhere
near that,” said Ervin,.

‘According to her, the optimal
blood supply at any time would be
large enough to last for seven days.

“Right now, we’re not even see-
ing two days,” she said.

The blood supply in the area
has been low before, ,Ervin added.
In fact, the region had to postpone
elective surgeries in a similar effort
during July 2002.

Prior to that,_it had been ten
years since they had needed to
postpone surgeries.

“It had always been a seasonal
problem,” Ervin said. In the sum-
mer, with donors on vacation,
blood supplies would drop.

Blood supply

re—evaluated

Blood, page 1 I

‘But now it seems like a year-
round problem,” she added.
Dr. Joseph Kiss, CBB’s medical

.director, called the delays “a last

resort.”

“The decision to delay surgery
is not one to be made lightly,” Kiss
said. _

The supply of type 0 blood is
particularly low because it is the
most commonly used in surgery. 0
positive is the most common type

in people, and 0 negative is the.

“universal donor” and can be used
for patients of any blood type,
Ervin said. _
According to Ervin, CBB will
assess the blood supply on Friday
to determine if the delay will con-
tinue. They may also encourage
doctors to recommend direct dona-
tions, in which a family member or
friend donates blood specifically
for the patient, or autologous dona-
tions, in which the patient donates

bloodprior to surgery to be used

during the procedure.

However, what the bank really
needs is more donors, she said.

‘We’ll take anything we can
get,” she said. “But the most: criti-
cal right now is anything in group
O.” -

New and eligible donors can‘

schedule an appointment to give
blood by calling 1 (866) DONORS-
1 or logging on to www.central—
bloodbank.org. There are 22 donor
centers in the Pittsburgh area.

“Get your butts in here,” Ervin

said. “You can save up to three ‘

lives.”

 

 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  

Earlier this
week, there
was a blood
drive in the
William Pitt
Union. The ‘
blood went to
the Central
Blood Bank to
help replenish
the dwindling
supply of
blood locally,
which has
caused some I
elective opera-
tions to be
postponed.

“Yet many serious disorders often

Cloned monkeys, then, would‘

provide better_models for testing
treatments and monitoring human

But- the process of cloning
remains a controversial debate
worldwide.

D.A.R.E. to think of a better solution

Chartiers Valley School District
officials are concerned they may be
unable to continue offering the
D.A.R.E. program — formerly Drug
Abuse Resistance Education, but
recently changed to Define, Assess,
Respond, Evaluate because
Colliers township commissioners
have canceled their police depart-
ment’s involvement in the district’s
program, and Chartiers Valley primar-
ily drew its D.A.R.E. officers from
Colliers.

The commissioners say they don’t
want to cut the program and that
Chartiers Valley should just look to.
other local departments to find offi-
cers certified as D.A.R.E. instructors.

/‘ That’s easier said than done, of
course. '

Other nearby departments have.

few certified officers, and those offi-

cers have their hands full. What’s at .

the heart of this issue, like so many
others, lately, is money.

About two—thirds of the cost of
D.A.R.E. is paid for by the school dis-
trict, and the township picks up the
rest. D.A.R.E. isn’t cheap, and offi-
cers have said they routinely do more
work for it than they bill for. It’s a
huge financial burden.

. The unfortunate reality is that
D.A.R.E. doesn’t work. _

It has not been proven to reduce

drug experimentation among gradu-

ates. D.A.R.E. exposes kids to the
knowledge of drugs they" may never
have heard of, and scares them need-
lessly. I

For the federal government to
institute an anti-drug program in

"schools is noble. For money to be
poured into an ineffective waste of

valuable class time, however, is not.
The current monetary crunch

ought to be an impetus to find a more

effective method for preventing drug

abuse among teens.-Hardship is the

mother of innovation — why not use
this lack of resources to discover new
possibilities?

Rather than draining overtaxed
police forces with a six—week pro-
gram, why not have an officer visit a
class once or twice to provide a con-
crete heads-up to kids — present
them with possible consequences for
taking drugs and maybe tell a horror
story or two. Find recovering addicts
willing to speak to kids about what
they went through and the hardships
the kids can be ‘spared by avoiding
drugs. Have a unit in health class dis-
cussing the dangers of drugs.

Find a cost-effective‘ program that
actually works. Force the stoner kids
to go to the Salvation Army to find
D.A.R.E. shirts to wear while they sit
around smoking pot and thinking of
clever, alternative acronyms like
Drugs Are Really Exciting.

breasts, I simply say, “It’s not
your fault.” They can be diﬂicult to avoid. I
consider myself quite modest, so I hope I
didn’t give too much away about my body,
but just enough to give me credibility.
Outside of the porn industry, larger breasts
have no advantage over smaller ones. This is
a constant debate between my A and B
friends and I. '

Big breasts are a burden, not a blessing.
Jennifer Love Hewitt said in Seventeen
Magazine that she was once uncomfortable
with her 34C bust size, but eventually saw
her breasts as “accessories to various out-
ﬁts.” She must have been referring to topless
bathing suits. Because, pardon the allitera— -
tion, but bigger breasts make shirt shopping
suck When a top ﬁts my chest, it’s too long
in the sleeves and too baggy elsewhere. If it
ﬁts in the sleeves and torso, my chest is
always busting out enough for my mother to
say, _“Oh honey, I don’t think so.”

Another point my A and B friends think
they have in defense of larger breasts is their

surgery and the after-aﬁects. Is -

ﬁllingout a tube top worth an

early death?

I know there are plenty of women who
are just as unhappy with their less-than-large
breasts as I am about my more-than-small

ones. But as someone on the other, larger .
side, I implore you to cherish "your able-to— "

ﬁt-in shirts and every-bit-as-at11a'ctive, pain-

less breasts. And for those of you who are
observers rather than carriers of breasts, 8

instead of drooling at Pam Anderson, Fake
Boob 1 and Fake Boob 2, please tell your
signiﬁcant other how perfect her breasts are.
I can ramble on about adoring your breasts,
but what am I going to do in order to one day
adore my own chest size? ‘ j _

To avoid Pam’s out-of-control appear-
ance, I plan to become incredibly obese, so
my breasts blend in with the rest of my body.

Finding international illumination in a blackout

The next day, I would find a bill-
board on the side of one of Toronto’s

I a main power plants that boldly pro-

claimed, in white bold on top of a
black background, the slogan, “We
deliver exciting possibilities.”

But that irony remained still elu-
sive, as I fumbled my way_ down the
darkened staircase of my hostel to
learn that the power outage was city-
wide.

As the initial confusion passed
and the day subsided into an eerily
dark night, the city evolved into a
Lockean state of nature, where peo-
ple stood in offensively long lines to
pay for the cheapest and most basic
things.

There was no looting, no fire, no
rioting and no gunshots. It wasn’t
nearly as exciting as I hoped, at first,
it would be. I was surprised, when I
reached my friend in New York City,
to learn that New Yorkers, too, were
acting civil.

All this, I suppose, could have
been predicted by someone with
knowledge of our nation’s power
grids and an optimistic view ‘of
human nature. But what happened in
the hostel came as a surprise, to me,

at least. Something about the dark-

ness freed our conversations to grow

in scope. In a civil and intelligent

way, we touched on history, travel,

I everything. The two Dutch

politics, culture and education.

And being the only American, I
found myself the sole voice for a
way of life that seemed foreign to
the various accents I found around
me.

I tried to explain the nature of a
liberal arts curriculum, and A
Wolfgang, the German,
replied that it sounded like
we learned nothing about

girls were also confused,
and I conceded that, for
most people, that’s how it
ended up working out.

I asked what the main-
stream conception of the_
United States‘ was in their
respective countries. LA
drunk and high Canadian
rickshaw driver said the key differ-
ence between the United States and
Canada is that, at every party he’s
ever been to in the States, he’s found
guys yelling at girls to ﬂash them.
That, he‘ says, is unheard of in
Canada.

Wolfgang brought up the film
“Bowling for Columbine” and said
that it had been hugely popular all
over Germany. And that it had put a
new face on America and practically
defined Canada in the minds of most
Germans.‘ It was, apparently, the

Columnist

same way in the Netherlands.
“Bowling for Columbine” does
touch on some major issues in the
United States today, but the majority
of its particular pieces of informa-
tion are either fabricated or mislead-

» ing. As I said in a column I devoted‘

to it last spring, the
overall approach is more
cunning than coherent,
and there is, at present,
serious talk» of revoking
the .Oscar given to
“Bowling” director
Michael Moore.
As the night passed,
we talked about the mer-
its of federalism, global,-

 

ic imperialism it pro-
I motes, the lack of
responsibility in recent journalism,
drinking customs — they don’t have
pitchers in Germany — and lan-
guage. It was, apparently, a very
American thing to do when I joking-
ly told, a British girl that her pronun-
ciation of “schedule” just sounded
weird. ' I _
When the subject of the war in

Iraq came up, I held that most-peo- '

ple I know were against it but that I
believed that, in five years, the Iraqi
people will assuredly be better off
for it. Although I did admit that if

ization and the econom-

the weapons aren’t found, that
would prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt that we had no real reason to
go in and that we had been systemat-
ically lied to and manipulated by our

government, which is probably the‘

case. _
Eventually, one of the Dutch
girls asked me, point blank, why I
liked being American. I was quick to
note that our national consciousness
did have serious flaws. I mentioned
our false sense of entitlement, eth-
nocentrism, almost anachronistic
sense -of conservative values and the

_ fact that we simply don’t know how

to party.

In defense, I added that most
Americans -really do have a sense of
themselves as a free people. And
while, in actuality, we are less free,
in many ways, than the rest of the
developed,-’wor.ld, Americans tend to
define themselves with this concept.

And when people define them-
selves with a concept like freedom,
whether it’s justified or not, it adds a
sense of individualism and opportu-
nity to their hearts and minds.

Granted, a lot of bad comes with
those things, ‘as well. But she
seemed satisfied with that.

John Henry’s spiritual legacy to beer—chugging purist

Sometime around fourth grade, in the tall—tales
unit of history class, we learned of John Henry and his‘

from his mission.

Unconsciousness and nausea are all that can deter_ him test that deﬁned his mission, his faith, and his chug-
I ging ability.

valiant but ultimately fatal effort to defeat a steam-
powered railroad drill. In his ﬁnal stand against the
encroaching rise of technology, the mythical Henry
outlasted the machine at the cost of his own" life. Such
strength and perseverance rightly ensured John Hemy
a place in American lore and the hearts of all red-
blooded citizens. _
Although our society now embraces automation,
one man, in the mold of John Henry, has embarked on
a crusade against modern drinking technology. What
device, you ask, could so raise his ire? None other
than that most heinous invention, the beer bong. _
Our man is a purist. Blessed with the ability to
guzzle ungodly amounts in a single gulp, this modem-
day John Hemy rails against the ease of chugging con-
ferred by the funnel. In his view, chugging is a talent,

. and those who need to resort to a bong should not

attempt to swill so much so quickly. To prove the
superiority of the human spirit — and throat — our
hero challenges any and all bongers to a one—beer
speed-chugging contest; a duel, if you will. With
sphincters relaxed, he pours the Pabst unimpeded to
the depths of his bowels. _

Thus far, all challengers have been turned away in
shame. This proud American conquerorwill never be
stopped, not by Pabst Ice, not by American Light, not
even by Lord Chesterﬁeld. Not by German stout,
Belgian ' wheat ale, or Canadian lager.

Last weekend, John Henry’s spiritu-
al heir was challenged not once, not
twice, but four times to prove his swal-
lowing superiority.

The first three were not close.
Facing young women who were not pre-
pared for the juggernaut who is our man,
the beer ﬂowed like the proverbial
mountain stream on its way to ﬁnally
reside somewhere in the ironclad recess-

 

As the judge counted to three, he took
a mighty breath and raised his trusty plastic
cup. In _a ﬂash, both combatants had
downed their frosty beverages, the mechan-
ical power of the funnel narrowly edging
the natural ability of our man’s throat. It
seemed the champion had lost. '

But upon lowering his beer bong, the
treacherous Happy Valley resident’ was
revealed to have beer remaining in the

of a challenge. A visiting young man,
trained in beer bonging at the hallowed
drinking halls of Penn State and buoyed by the conﬁ-
dence that only alcohol can provide, dared confront
the champion. By this point, our hero was far beyond
any recommended dosage of cheap beer, but his pride
and his crusade could not be halted bymere intoxica-
tion. The modern John Henry had finally met his
match. I

The showdown at the South Oakland corral had
begun. The champion, with the home crowd roaring in
his ears, accepted the challenge with slurred speech
and squinting eyes, and began to pour what could be
his ﬁnal beer. Staring unsteadily at the upstart Nittany
Lion with his sneer and his funnel, our hero prepared
himself as best he could. He knew this would be the

Depp once again stealsthe show in mediocre film

Once Upon a Time in
Mexico

Starring Antonio Banderas,
Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp,
Willem Dafoe

Directed by Robert Rodriguez
ﬁnk 1/2

CHAD EBERLE
Senior Staff Writer

“Once Upon a Time in Mexico”
is the second sequel to director
Robert Rodriguez’ homemade shoot-
er “El Mariachi” (“Desperado” was
the first). The first two films in the
series were pretty simple.
“Mariachi” was made with an
unthinkably tiny budget of $7,000,
and “Desperado,” though produced
by a major studio, was still just a
film about a vengeful, gun—toting
guitar player taking on an army of
unsavories. They were “flicks” —
good ones.

Though Rodriguez’s first credit
on “Mexico” labels it"‘A Robert
Rodriguez flick,” the film —- regret-
tably —- tries to be something more.

The result is an overblown and
overcomplicated intrigue film, the
middle of which is bogged down by
convoluted exposition setting up a
stilted ending that’s supposed to be a
statement of Mexican nationalism.

And I was just expecting to see
Antonio Banderas shoot people.

The Mariachi (Banderas), going
by “El” this time around, is recruit-
ed by inexplicably depraved, albeit
charismatic, CIA agent Sands
(Johnny Depp) into a plot to allow a
presidential assassination to occur,
and then to foil a drug lord’s
(Willem Dafoe) subsequent’ coup
d’etat. E1 is on board because the
leader of the coup is an evil face
from his past, a.man from whom
he’d' like to take back a pound or two
of ﬂesh.

There are plotlines following not
only El and the rest of his band —
Enrique Iglesias appears packing a
flamethrower and a killer haircut —
but also the CIA, the FBI, a retired

FBI agent—turned—vigilante (Ruben,

Blades), the president and the drug
cartel, all crisscrossing in ways that
aren’t always coherent. And at

in

times, the film is actually dull, even and edited the film, and wrote its

with its frequent bursts of ultra—vio-

lence.

But there is a saving

Johnny Depp is cool
beyond all cool in this
film. Yes, it’s “Pirates of
the Caribbean” all over
again — when the actor
isn’t on screen, you’re
just waiting for him to
return. Alternately homi-
cidal and hilarious, his
character is guaranteed to

.be one of the sickest bas-

tards you ever root for in a
film. His work alone is
enough to make the film
required viewing.

Even when his ‘films
fall short, Rodriguez must
be saluted for how fully
engaged in the process of
filmmaking he is. On
“Mexico,” he not only
gets the “written and
directed by” credit, but
also a remarkable “shot,

«chopped, and scored by” 3

credit 4 he photographed

score.
And man, canhe make his —
actors look like badasses.

i3FiETl'Y G PLS MAKE-GRAVES
THE NEW ROMANCE

A wishy—washy message
can’t mar the good music

The New Romance
Pretty Girls Make Graves
Matador Records
7fr7i‘r1/2

It’s no coincidence that the opening
track on The New Romance is titled
“Something Bigger, Something
Brighter.” For Pretty Girls Make
Graves, a Seatt1e—based quintet with a

» penchant for explosive guitar riffs, this

title is a double-edged sword. While
Andrea “Don’t Say Corin Tucker”
Zollo pleads for the electrification of an
existential rut,‘ guitars pluck in the
background and eventually clash
together like ~ punked-out - sumo
wrestlers, showing us that there’s some-
thing “bigger” and “brighter” about the
band itself this time around.

Last year, the band dropped Good
Health on Touch & Go Records, which
established it as one of the more talent-
ed, diverse, and musically ambitious
groups of its kind. The New Romance

does nothing‘ short of maintaining that.

Whether guitars are crunching, dis-
torted organs are intervening, hand
claps are impatiently replacing the

drums, or Zollo’s vocals are adding

more vigor to an already bursting musi-
cal assault, Romance simply refuses to
stop. _
, ut with lyrics like “You’ll feel bet-
ter when you cannot feel,” and “Doctor,
do you have a Remedy?” and with
Zollo seemingly begging her way
through the album, it’s hard to gauge
exactly what she’s begging for. Youth
culture enlightenment? A new
boyfriend? Ritalin? A new president in
office? Whatever it is, it’s clear that it’s
desperately wanted. '
Though the message may seem

wishy—washy at times, Romance‘

remains a showcase for an incredibly
talented band with the musical and
social ambition to stick around for a
while. ’

Mercury, page 10
bands -9 owensring, sun Small
Voice and The Delaneys — we

often do some shows with if we
have some opening s1ots,” Morris

said. “They’ll be thefirst bands we;

call, because we like playing with
them for various reasons.”

But it’s the news that Morris’s
favorite local band, Grapevine, is
getting back together that has him

0 elated.

“We have a lot of people come
up and tell’ us, ‘Oh, you guys are
going to be huge; I can’t believe
you haven’t made it. I listen to your
CD all the time. I can’t stop; I can’t

take it out of myvCD player.’ It’s the

same thing when I would see those
guys,” he said. “Every time I see
them, I’m a fan for’ that two hours.
And then once I see them down-
stairs, I start bullshitting with them
again and it’s just back to, ‘Hey,
what’s up Kevin?’ I think there’s no
reason they ‘shouldn’t be big. But
we don’t make thosexcalls.”

Morris also got abitstar-struck
when“ Mercury opened up for.Live

this summer at Chevrolet
Amphitheatre."
“It was surreal,” he said.

“People were‘ so scared around us
and asking us for autographs. The
exact same feelingtthey had to us
was the feeling I had standing next
to Live backstage as they were eat-
ing sandwiches.”

Mercury has played for several
charity events, including The Jam
on Walnut for Cystic Fibrosis and
the Janiene Patterson Benefit. This
weekend, they are playing to bene-
fit the Lupus Foundation.

"‘We like to do as much as we

. can to help other people who might
, not necessarily be able to help‘
“themselves.” Morris said.

Mercury is playing at the
Pittsburgh‘Brewing Company on
Sat., Sept. 13 with Pittsburgh Banjo

Men’s soccer revives
offense but still loses 3-2

JIMMY JOHNSON
For The Pitt News

After being shut out in the
Mayors Cup last ‘weekend, the Pitt
men’s soccer team broke out of its
offensive woes Wednesday night

Junior defender Clay Haﬂich dribbles the ball downﬁeld: during the

against Robert Morris, but their

efforts were not enough to come

away with a victory — the Panthers
fell 3-2. ' -

The Colonials (2-2-1) applied
early pressure’ on the Panthers, but

moved the ball downfield to score
the game’s,first goal.

The goal was a result of a short
kick by Colonials’ goalkeeper
Tomer Chencinski. Panthers’ mid-
fielder Jeffrey Tidd controlled the
short kick and lofted it to Marco
Carrizales, who was
cutting between two
Colonials’ defend-
er_s. Carrizales set-

quickly.fired it past
the - diving

er at the 12-minute
mark.

With a few
minutes remaining
in the first half, the
Colonials took

. advantage of a
Panthers turnover
and broke downfield
on an odd—man rush.
Colonials’ forward
Said Ali carried the
ball down’ to the

right of Panthers’

goalkeeper Justin
Lowery.

He passed it
across the goalie

box to a wide-open

David Currie, who

booted the ball into
’ the back of the net.

The second
half did not bring an
end to the
Colonials’ offensive
success. Joe Di
Buono caught
Lowery out of posi-
tion and scored the
go-ahead goal into a
wide-open‘ net at the
53-minute
The open—net -"goal

rebound off of a

Rutherford
has yet to
prove mental

toughness
 vtsw

     

Before anyone begins organizing a
parade dedicated to the mental tough-

ness of Rod Rutherford or erecting

shrines to his emotional stability as a
player, perhaps the expression of a bet-
ter-rounded perspective is in order.

Yes, Rutherford did put up incredi-
ble numbers in Pitt’s season opener. And
yes, he has most likely been under a
great deal of duress as of late.

But how difﬁcult was Rutherford’s
opposition last Saturday? And how will
the future shape up for the currently
questionable quarterback?

Kent State University is not exactly
a defensive powerhouse. Last season,
Kent State allowed opponents to score
an average of 3513 points per game,
playing against teams like the
University of Akron Zips, who ﬁnished
the 2002 season with a dismal record of
4-8, but managed to defeat Kent State
48-10.

This year, Kent State edged out the
Zips 41-38, but it would be hard to
argue that they possess a defense to be
feared by Pitt.

I’1l jump on the bandwagon when
Rutherford throws for four touchdowns
against Notre Dame, or reaches 288

. yards in two quarters against 

Not that these kinds of numbers are to
be expected or taken for granted, but
before Rutherford proves himself
against the major players in Pitt’s sched-
ule, any talk of overcoming the opposi-
tion of the subconscious is premature.
Why is there any reason to believe
that, if Rutherford was under mental
strain in the Kent State game, he will not
be under additional stress in every game
to come, as his story off‘ the ﬁeld
unfolds? Whether Rutherford did or did

not do anything, the situation is not like-

Professional wrestling counts as a real sport

I don’t know a touchdown from
a touchback. I heard the Pirates are
getting -a new goalie, and Allen
Iverson’s batting average is through
the roof. '

For all my studied ignorance of
American sporting traditions, there
is one sport I can speak on with star-
tling, authority.

I may not know what RBI
means, but I can expound on senton
bombs, Asai moonsaults and dragon
suplexes with the best of them.

That’s right, my one area of ath-
letic , expertise is professional
wrestling. _

And don’t even try to say it’s not
asport. '

World Wrestling Entertainment
is not a sport, it’s a soap opera for
boys. But ultraviolent indie—federa-
tion, thumbtacks-and—light-tubes-as-

‘weaponry wrestling -—— now that,

ladies and gentlemen, is a sport.
I My accidental love affair with
underground, hardcore wrestling

began as a child. My older brother, a .
Hulkamaniac from before ‘ it was —
« retro—hip to be so, had always loved

wrestling, but the World Wrestling
Federation — the name of the WWE
before those environmental goonies
at the World Wildlife Fund rained on
their parade —— proved too tame for
him. 

. We»’re originally from near
Philadelphia, so Extreme
Championship Wrestling was the
obvious choice for him to feed his
bloodlust. He somehow managed to

find ECW tapes at video stores, and.

although I wasn’t allowed to watch
R—rated movies, I spent plenty of

time watching bloody cage matches

and seeing brutal chair shots to the
heads of such greats as Terry Funk
and Mick Foley as the irrepressible
Cactus’ Jack. A

Sadly, ECW wasabsorbed, along '

with WWE’s feeder farm—team fed-
eration, _World Championship
Wrestling, into the WWE. While
Vince McMahon attempts to congeal
all of wrestling into one slickly mar-
keted, kid—friendly amalgamation,

‘crazy young masochists all over the

nation are keeping the legacy of the
founding fathers of violence and
pain alive.

Haflich scored by redirecting a corner kick
with his head into the back of the net.
Haf1ich’s goal sparked a multitude of
offensive chances for the Panthers, including
one of his own shots that went off the cross-
bar and over the net. Haflich came close to
scoring again when he redirected another
kick with his head, only to watch the oppos-

In an attempt to create a stronger offense,
Coach Joe Luxbacher had the Panthers play
in a different offensive system than the one
they used for the first three games of the sea-
son, which produced only one goal prior to
this game.

“We did play better offensively,”
Luxbacher said. “But you cannot give up
three goals and expect to win.”

The new offensive scheme enabled a few
more players to move into the offensive zone
and allowed Pitt to place more pressure on

Rutherford’s test has yet to come

Fleming, page 15 '

ly to be resolved soon. And, short of a
lobotomy, not much will take the con-

‘ 4 ﬂict entirely out of his head.

How can we be sure that the game
against Texas A&M will not coincide
with a major revelation in the process
surrounding the charges filed against
Rutherford? .

When the pressure is turned up, and
the public has either rallied behind
Rutherford or torn him apart in effigy,
we will see just how tough Rutherford
is. I’m not saying that I believe
Rutherford will necessarily fail when
the challenge is raised. I simply would
rather wait and see.

The growing sentiment on campus
seems to be that the war is over. I’m con-
vinced it has only just begun.

Many facts surrounding
Rutherford’s criminal case and the

team’s punitive actions have been

guarded by silence and legality. But that
will not hold up forever.

Eventually, the full story will come
out. And when it does, will Rutherford

be the same? Will the team around him '

be the same?

Pitt’s schedule does not play well
into the hands of a starting quarterback
dealing with the long ' and strenuous
process of law. Autumn’s attrition takes

its toll. .

A second look at Rutherford in the
upcoming Ball State University game
may answer some questions, but for
those of us not coaching for Pitt, atten-
tion should be tumed toward the future,
beginning with Texas A&M.

On Sept. 27, Rutherford will have to
lead the Panthers on the road against a
team that beat Pitt by two points at
Heinz Field last year. .

Then Pitt must match up against a
formidable opponent — Notre Dame —
followed by seven straight‘ Big East
games, lasting from Oct. 18 to Nov. 29.

The season culminates with a dra-
matic close against ‘Miami. at Heinz
Field, in what is sure to be an immense-
ly important game. - '

' With an entire season’s worth of
bangs and bruises, from on the field and

off, Rutherford will have to face the T.

strongest team in Pitt’s schedule.

When the clock runs out in ‘late
November, then, and only then, will we
know how tough Rutherford really is.

Make no mistake; Rutherford’s test
is far from over. So before a chant,
rivaled in ridiculousness only by last
year’s “Bring in Palko!” begins through-

out Oakland, please, a little perspective.
