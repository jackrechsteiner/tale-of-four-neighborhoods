CMU rally focuses on peace

JARED SHELLY
Staff Writer

As Bob Dylan’s soft voice told the tale of “the
answer is blowin’ in the wind” over a loudspeaker, a
group of 150 students . gathered at Carnegie Mellon
University yesterday to push" one sentiment: peace. ’

Andress Appolon, a native New Yorker who is still
waiting to hear from ﬁiends in her hometown, served

as the peace rally’s emcee. She introduced 11 student /

speakers who offered opinions and rationale that
focused on peace as the only solution to the problem of

« the recent terrorist attacks in New York and

Washington.

“No peace was ever achieved from violence,” said
Stuart Anderson, a CMU student. “An eye for an eye
leaves the world blind.”

Another student, Quinten Steenhuis, stood looking -

at the American ﬂag at half-mast and asked whether
violence is really the answer.

“How could we say that we want to inﬂict ﬂue

same pain on another group of innocent people?”
Steenhuis asked.

Appolon, a CMU senior, then approached the
microphone to read a quote by Abraham Lincoln.
“Force is all-conquering but its victories are short-
liv ” she said.

The speakers stood in front of a fence at CMU,
which students had decorated with black paint and
white lettering, adorned with phrases, such as “We’ll go
on together” and “Feel the pain, share the love.”

The idea for a peace rally came after three -students
and a professor met last week to plan an event in the
name of peace. By Friday night, the group of four
turned into 15, and began calling themselves the Ad
Hoc Committee for Peace and Justice.

“This was not plarmed, it was out of necessity,”-
said Mark Egerman, a CMU student who said he was
personally affected by the tragedy. Egerrnan had a fam-
ily friend inside one of the planes that hit theWorld
Trade Towers.

When he found out that a friend of his family was
on the plane, his perception of the tragedy changed.

“It turned from a honible abstract tragedy into a ,

honible personal tragedy,” Egerman said.

Egerrnan said the loss prompted him to work with
others to hold the peace rally.

But not every student at the rally held the peaceful
opinions expressed by the speakers. '

“There’s good intentions, but it won’t lead to
peace, just more terrorist attacks, ” said Lawrence
Beasly, a CMU student who debated with others for an
hour after me event.

“If we do nothing militarily, will it go away?”
Beasly asked.

scholarship honors  

one student,  
rewards another

RENEE ALBERTS
Staff Writer

Aroomful of smiling faces watched the chance for one student’s
success’ grow despite the destruction of anoﬂ1er’s.

Yesterday, in a ceremony in, Allen Hall, Patrick Irvin received
the Emil "Sanielevici Undergraduate Research Scholarship.

Emil Sanielevici, a Pitt physics major, died when Ronald Taylor

. ‘allegedly opened ﬁre at a Wrlkinsburg McDonald’s restaurant in a

racially motivated shooting in March 2000.

, The scholarship awards a full undergraduate tuition for one temr
to the winning candidate. The application for the scholarship, avail-
able to physics and astronomy majors, requests infomiation on the
candidate’s coursework and experience as well as a description of a
proposed research project.

Irvin, a junior physics major, said he felt honored and surprised

' at winning the scholarship.

“It has inﬂuenced me to work harder,“ he said. “l’ve learned
more practicing research than I would have simply from class.”

The scholarship was made possible by the combined efforts of
several department employees, including Dr. Ralph Roskies, profes-

_ sor David J asnow and staff member Judy Stern.

- According to Pitt spokesman Robert Hill, the scholarship is a
result of a discretionary allocation by Chancellor Mark N ordenberg.
Nordenberg did not attend the ceremony, but in a statement
released by the department of news and information, he praised
Sanielevici. _

“Everyone who knew him believed that he reﬂected the best of
the human spirit,” Nordenberg said. “He was hard-working, bright
and inquisitive. It is particularly ﬁtting that we have this chance to
honor him this way.”

Emil’s father, Sergiu Sanielevici, expressed his feelings toward
the memorial scholarship in the speech he gave at the award cere-
mony. . .

“We, Emil’s family, are touched and gratiﬁed that this memori-
al will help other promising students continue where Emil fell,” he
said.

A He described Emil as having a physicist’s attitude, which

enabled him to separate his emotions and ego from his ability to

revise his ideas on the problems he faced.

“I often can’t help thinking that, were his physicist’s atritude
_more _ widespread in our society, Emil would 0 still be alive,”
Sanielevici said. .

Sanielevici also sees a possibility for prevention of further
tragedies. “[Emil] was a victim of a conﬂuence of racism, the cult of
violence-and guns, chronic poverty, mental illness and the inadequa-
cy of its treatment, of an individual’s’ failure to resist malignant and
destructive thoughts and of society’s failure to help him do so,” he
said. “Perhaps, if we work to cultivate this physicist’s attitude with-
in ourselves  we can use Emil’s own methods to help reduce the
incidence of tragedies such as the one that killed him.”

Few students present as SGB

prepares for vigil, relief efforts

‘ SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

Student Government Board members
Michelle Agostini and Kevin Washo were
surprised by the rows of empty seats at last
night’s board meeting. I

’ “It’s wonderful to see the place so
packed,” Agostini said.

Washo said, “I want to thank all the
die-hards for coming out.”

. After entertaining a packed conference

- room last week, only a handful of - students -
attended the board’s third regular meeting. .

Last week’s crowd was present for the
unveiling of the board’s ﬁrst resolution,
0007, introduced by Agostini and Heidi
Busche. .

The resolution recognizes that “large

increases in tuition without proportionate‘

increases in ﬁnancial‘ aid has [sic] system-
atically taken away the right to higher edu-
cation . . . from lower income students” and
calls on “all faculty, the board of trustees,
administration and especially Chancellor
[Mark] Nordenberg” to join with SGB in
an 11-point plan to, among other things,
cap tuition increases, implement retention
programs and lobby at the state level for
more University funding.

“Therefore, it is resolved,” the docu-
ment read, “that [SGB] ... will implement
a campaign to ensure that all students, irre-
gardless [sic] of race, ethnicity, gender, sex-
uality and/or class, will have the right to
higher education.” I _ _

Board member Lonnie Fish raised
debate relating to the amount of time given
to review the document ’

“[This resolution] was thrown on my
lap at the very last second and I’m not a fan
of that,” Fish said.

Washo agreed with Fish’s suggestion
to wait a week before passing the resolu-
tion to give the board additional time to
review it “It’s the responsible thing to do,”
he said.

Agostini apologized for the short

notice, but said the issues pertaining to it
aifect students daily, and asked the board to
pass it right away.

The resolution passed 5 to 3, with Fish,
Washo and John Algie registering the dis-
senting votes.-

Washo said the group was already
working on the list of 11 points.
At this week’s meeting, while not

,mentioning Resolution 0007, the board

focused primarily on today’s vigil and
other relief efforts.

President Jeff Alex opened with a
moment of silence for those touched by
Tuesday’s terrorist attacks on New York
City and Washington, D.C He also
armounced that the group is working with
the Pitt chapter of the American Red Cross
on a project called “Change America” On-
and off-campus students will compete this
week to see who can donate the most
change, to beneﬁt the Red Cross’s disaster
relief fund for the attacks.

Board members are continuing with
their individual projects as well. Agostini
reported that her ﬁnancial aid seminar is on
schedule, and Washo said he, President
Pro-Tempore Carrie Howard and Keriarme
Ludwig are working to plan a statewide
conference between’ legislators, adminis-
trators and students regarding ﬁnancial aid
and tuition increases.

Howard, Washo and Fish will also be
worldng to measure student opinion on
Van Call in the coming week.’ Busche
reported she is continuing her work to
compile an off-campus housing directory.
Ludwig is also working with the urban
studies department to identify and deal
with “irresponsible” landlords in the
Oakland area

Megan Fetzer and Washo attended
Saturday’s student forum and collected stu-
dent ideas for ways Pitt can help disaster
relief in New York and Washington.

- Algie reported that he is working on
revamping the Freshman Affairs commit-
tee, hoping eventually to expand several
subcommittees 
. Of the eight board members, two will
attend today’s student leaders meeting with
Vice Provost and Interim Dean of ‘Students
Dr.’ Jack Daniel. The meeting, which falls
on Jewish holy day Rosh Hashanah also
coincides with this moming’s silent vigil in
honor of the victims of Tuesday’s attack

“['Fuesday’s events] really put every-

thing into perspective,” Washo said. j

“Sometimes there are more important
things than student government.”

Corrections: . ,

In the Sept. 10 edition of The Pitt News, Dr. Jack Daniel was quot-
ed as a speaker at the BAS Indaba. Dr. Daniel did not attend the event —
his comments were made in a previous interview.

In the Sept. 11 edition, Pitt marching band director Jack Anderson
was quoted saying that the University’s decision to cut the “Penn State
sucks” chant was made by athletic director Steve Pederson. Athletics
spokesman E.J. Borghetti is responsible for this quote.

Local restaurant plays 

host to poetic passion

TRAVIS REAL
Staff Writer

In a dark, smoky basement of a
bar in the heart of Oakland, Pitt stu-
dents painted pictures in the minds
of their audience.

Thursday night was poetry night
at Fuel and Fuddle. And for those
who listened, it was a trip worth

taking.
“Whenever I have a free
moment I always come,” said

Malkiel Chaseed, an English gradu-
ate student pursuing a Ph.D. in crit-
ical and cultural studies of English.
“And then there’s mic night. I
haven’t .missed open mic for five
years now.”

Pitt has held poetry readings at
Fuel and Fuddle for seven years.
Every Thursday at 8:30 p.m., facul-
ty and students come together to
share poems and prose. The sister
event takes place at Hemingway’s
on Tuesday nights. The director for
both events is Pitt faculty member
Lynn Emmanuel, who also provides
the microphone equipment.

Thursday was Masters of Fine

Arts Night at which graduate stu-
dents shared their literary creations.
Cara Ford and Erin Teegarden,
both graduate students, hosted the
evening. Eight poets read their
work during the hour—long event.
Among the noise and chaos of the
basement, Teegarden explained the
reason and appeal of these events.

“First of all, the reason we have
these readings is mainly for enter-
tainment. It’s hectic being a gradu-
ate student and so this evening
gives us a chance to relax,” said
Teegarden.

“Second, it gives us a chance to
hear what our peers are writing so
that we might critique them and
help them to improve,” she said.
“Also, poetry is something that’s
just meant to be read out loud and
heard.” .

Teegarden said that the poetry
readings are open to everyone. She
said that there would be talent and
undergraduate nights on this term’s
schedule.

NYU students react

ELIZABETH KASSAB
Michigan Daily

New York University sophomore
Bryce Roebel said he attended class as
usual after watching from Washington
Square Park as United Airlines Flight
175 crashed into World Trade Center
Tower 2 Tuesday.

“During class they collapsed, so.
when I came out of class and looked
south, they weren’t there,” he said.

The collapse knocked out power in
four of NYU’s residence halls, including
the one Roebel lives in. .

Like thousands of other New Yorkers
who live in the vicinity of the World
Trade Center, Roebel has not yet been
able to return to his home.

Roebel said he has been staying with
friends, and NYU gave students some
money to buy clothes and other necessi-
ties they didn’t have. '

' The residence halls farther away
from the site of the terrorist attacks
remained open. NYU freshman Chris
Hale still has access to his residence hall,
located near Washington Square Park. He

I walked out of his room Tuesday morning

on his way to a class, not realizing what
had happened.

“I noticed a lot of people just stand-
ing around,” he said. “When I got to the
corner, I looked downtown and saw lots
of smoke.”

Second-year law student Denise
Ryan said she and her neighbors stood in
and around Washington Square Park
watching the destruction-of the twin tow-
ers last Tuesday.

In the streets, people clustered
around the cars that were stopped in the
road to hear the radios’ explanations of
the sight". '

Ryan said she listened in “complete
»di_sbelief” as the reports kept coming in.

She then went to the law school,
where televisions were set up in the
lounge. Some of the students watching
‘had ﬁiends or family who worked in the
World Trade Center. _

“When the ﬁrst tower fell, you knew
there were people, in there that you knew,
and there was nothing you could do,”

_ Ryan said.

Tuesday was ﬁlled with ﬁantic
searches, she said. Since virtually no tele-
phones were working, people were using

‘e-mail and instant messaging services to

try tolocate friends and family.
The rest of New York responded
with an outpouring of support, she said.
“People were just trying to ﬁnd out
how they could help,” Hale said. “They
told people they needed blood, and then

_ within an hour they were telling people

there were ﬁve-hour lines.”
Ryan said she is skeptical that the

I United States would commit to a ground

war, but she admitted she would never
have imagined a week ago that the twin
towers could be the target of a terrorist
attack.

“If we’ve ever been justiﬁed in going
to war in the past, we’re justiﬁed now,”
she said.

When he was growing up, Roebel
said he dreamed of being in the Navy. ‘
Though he didn’t pursue that ambition,
he said he is willing to serve his country
now. . I
“I’d do almost anything if they asked
me to,” he said. “It’s time for everyone to
come together.”

We cannot let the terrorists win

Yesterday USAirways armounced that
it would lay off 11,000 employees.

Continental Airlines laid off 12,000.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average
dropped 685 points yesterday.

Looking at numbers like that, some
might say the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon wrecked the
American economy.

But things do not have to shape up this
way. .
When terrorists crashed the airliners,
many believe they intended to" disrupt the
United States’ economy. We should not let
them have their way. -

When the economy takes a downturn, it
only lasts a short period of time. The United
States knows how to recover.

While everyone should brace for a
recession worse than already predicted, it
will not be the end of the world Ifwe act like
our economy will never recover, the terror-
ists will have won.

We should maintain our -faith in our
ﬁnancial system. Our money is as safe in the
bank as it was last Monday, and it is still
much saferbeinginabankthanunderour
mattresses.

Stocks may continue to lose value, but
they had already been dropping for some
time before Tuesday. We have systems in
place to prevent future crashes. Trading
stops after the market falls a certain amount.

Consider this: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal

of Saudi Arabia is not selling his stocks, val- '

ued at about $20 billion, in spite of the
doomsday predictions concerning the stock
market '
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve lowered
interest rates, and the -Securities and
Exchange Commission relaxed its rules on
corporate stock buybacks. ‘
In oﬂrer words, everyone with power

‘ over the economy is doing what he or‘ she

can to increase our conﬁdence. We should
reciprocate their eﬂbrts by having conﬁ-
dence in the economy. '

Even the airline industry will recover.
New security regulations are already in place
at airports and armed federal law enforce-
ment agents will soon be ﬂying on commer-
cial  Businesspeople still have to ﬂy,
and soon more individual travelers will ﬂy
again as well. While no security procedure
can be 100 percent effective as a deterrent
against terrorism, air transportation remains
a safer option than ground transportation.

Things will be tight for a while, but the
economy will recover. If we don’t panic, that
recovery will come more quickly.

The hijackings were shocking, -but we
should not let the terrorists win. Weshould
show them that the United States will recov-
er, that even though they may have
destroyed a symbol of our economy, they
have not destroyed our economy. _

We must have faith in America. We will
recover. We must recover.

Silence, not cliches, best for

unpredictable responses. The response that

night was different.

In the days following Tuesday’s
attacks, I have read nearly a dozen editori-

These cliches do nothing but pay lip ser-

every person in this nation
now feels.

As my ﬁiend Heather

cliches because they are com-

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, September 18, 2001

On Sept. ll, 2001, the world
stopped. The gravitational pull drew
people to their television sets. The
ﬂow and ebb of tides washed us with
anger and grief in alternating waves.

‘ And, for as many as 10,000 people,

the world will never start again.

Death is impossible to understand,
because it ventures into the unknown.
Still, what we do know scares us. We
know that 10,000 people will never
hear their favorite song on the radio
again. We know that they will never
brush their - hair 53 times every
evening or smell the ocean again. We
know that they will never see the Big
Dipper or taste lemonade again.

We know they will never walk the
streets of New York or Washington or
Boston or Newark or any of the thou-
sands of places from which they hail
again. We know that just as we feel
the concrete below our feet and see
the ceiling of the sky above our heads,
they will never touch, taste, see, smell-
or hear again.

When many of my friends heard
the news, they reacted by going to the
7-Eleven to buy cigarettes. They then

proceeded to chain-smoke them in the
Ashtray, sitting quietly amidst‘ stu-
dents desperately dialing cell phones
and battling tears.

Why did they turn to the Marlboro
Man rather than, say, a trained coun-
selor? There is nothing abstract about
smoking. It is immediate and con-
crete. .

I have been to more religious ser-
vices this week than I have attended
this whole year. Though neither a
Christian nor a particularly observant
Jew, I attended morning mass at St.
Paul Cathedral and a candlelight vigil

amorphous concept, in contrast to the

Those coping with death suppos-
edly go through four stages: denial,
anger, bargaining and finally accep-
tance. In the past week, I have seen all
but the last emotion painted on pass-
ing faces: denial that any force could
challenge the United States; anger
directed and misdirected at those
allegedly responsible for these crimes
against humanity; a sense that if they

offer themselves in the form of blood’

or money, that they will be spared.
We are young. The world is full of
potential and possibility. We are at a
university because we want to invest
money, time and energy in the future

Panhellenic leader praises Greek

Words not enough

system as support network

MEGHAN FETZER
Newsmaker

Editor’s note: The following is submitted by a student
leader who is playing a role in a campus event.

A Newsmaker columns will appear periodically in The

Pitt News.

At ﬁrst, writing this column about Greek rush
seemed to be the antithesis of appropriateness at a time
of national tragedy. Why would becoming Greek be
important now? Nothing really, I thought. But then I
realized what I went through last week and those with
whom I went through it.

I counted on my sisters for help, support, friendship
and understanding when it ﬁrst happened. I walked into
my room and talked all day long with people I could
trust and felt safe around.

Yes, I wished that I had my family near, but with a
group of friends like these, I didn’t miss my family so
much. We cooked spaghetti and sat around and
watched CNN. Tears were ﬂowing and the phones kept
ringing. But we had each other, and that was enough for
us right then. I can count on these people in good times
and bad, and not expect the normal superﬁcial relation-
ships of just acquaintances.

The week continued and so much needed to be
donated: blood, money, clothing, anything. And then I
thought, “The Greeks are having a blood drive in the

N.

Board, is the internal vice president of the
National Panhellenic Association.

middle of October; should I give now or later?” Mid-
thought, an e-mail popped up telling all of the Greeks
not to donate blood until later. The blood bank was
overﬂowing and they needed us to’ replenish the supply
later rather than sooner. Now I,wasn’t the only one
counting on the Greeks: the blood bank was too.

Then I had a meeting with some student leaders on
the campus and we talked about what to do about the
crisis. Again, I realized how important being Greek
was. Many people suggested donating clothing to the

workers in New York. But no one really wanted to take‘

on the task of a full-blown clothing drive. ‘

But the Greeks will. And We’ll do it well. We’ll do
what is asked of us, and much more. We’ll do what
We’re expected and We’ll do it for the guy next door too.

We’re all involved outside of our houses to make
the University a better place. We belong to many orga-
nizations including Pitt Pathfinders, Student
Government Board, The Pitt News, Heinz Chapel
Choir, Blue and Gold Society, Pitt Program Council
and many others. We‘ are being counted on as a com-
mtmity service group, as money donors, as blood
donors. But that’s what we do, and that’s what we like
to do. ‘-

I wanted to express my gratitude to the Greeks for
getting me where I am today, because I do not believe

that I would be where I am and doing what I’m doing ‘

had I not joined a sorority. But now I will express my
gratitude to the Greeks for doing what they do best —
being themselves. I have never seen a more caring pop-
ulation and selﬂess group of people who will do almost
anything to help out someone else, andl thank all of
you for that.
Sorority and fraternity rush starts this week

to describe tragedy

Reddy, page 6

or even to articulate my own response, I think we need to choose
to not ﬁll our minds with empty language that prevents us from
truly facing the ramiﬁcations of this tragedy. T

The most compelling student writing I have seen in response
to these attacks came out of an assignment, in my  class:
“Write about where you were, or where you went directly after
hearing the news, but without explicitly mentioning the news.”
The results were powerful because we were forced to address the
deeply personal ways the attacks had touched each of us.

One student wrote about a frantic telephone conversation I

with his mother, who had heard that a plane crashed in Pittsburgh.
Another wrote about trying to get intouch with her father, who

A had had an appointment at the World Trade Center but had been

late. The writing I heard in class was more powerful than all the
editorials in the world because it dealt with the speciﬁcs, the ways
that each student had been individually affected by the attacks.

As a nation, it will take time for us to deal with this tragedy.
It will also take time for us to transcend cliche and write and speak
intelligently about the shock and horror of what happened on
Sept. 11. ‘

We carmot take back what happened last week, but we can try
to make something good come of it. If all that results from last
'D1esday’s events is a ﬂeeting and superﬁcial sense of unity, then.

' those lives trulywill have been lost. We need to learn to speak

honestly about this tragedy; this is the only way any real unity can
result. . . '
If we cannot yet speak honestly and in a manner that is truly
respectful of the magnitude of this tragedy, let us remain silent.
Some sorrows are too huge to name. Silence may well be the most
powerful choice we can make. '

Pitt teams back in the

back.

KENNETH PAUL .
Sports Editor

As the rest of the nation tries to
bring a sense of normalcy back to
everyday life, the same holds true
for Pitt sports, which get back
underway tonight when Pitt volley-
ball hosts Robert Morris College.

Between Sept. ll‘and.Sept. 16,
Pitt winter sports, which include
football", volleyball, cross country
and men’s and women’s soccer had
a total of 10 games canceled.

The first team to feel the impact

. was the volleyball team, which’ was

supposed to travel to Duquesne
University last Tuesday. The team
also had its Pittsburgh Invitational
erased, which featured games
against Fairfield, Cleveland State
University and Georgia Tech.

The ‘team’ goes into tonight’s
game with a perfect record against
Robert Morris (6-2), who has failed

_to defeat Pitt (2-5) in 15 tries. The

match is slated for a 7 p.m. start.

Pitt football hadlast Saturday’s
game against University of
Alabama-Birmingham canceled.
The football team will practice
tomorrow at 6 p.m. and Thursday
and Friday at 4 p.m.

The Alabama-Birmingham game
was rescheduled for Dec. 1. Pitt
football will not play again until
next Thursday, Sept. 27, when it

(hosts the No. 21 ranked Miami

Hurricanes at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN.

Women’s soccer gets
underway this Friday, Sept. 21,
when it hosts Georgetown
Universityat Founders Field. This
will be the first Big East game for
both schools. Pitt has split its first
four games, while Georgetown is 3-
1. ‘ . ’

Last Friday’s women’s soccer
game against St. John7s and
Sund'ay’s match against Arizona
were postponed. On Friday, the

Panthers will look to rebound from-

their 3-1 loss to UNC Greensboro.

Men’s Soccer also had two
games postponed. The men’s team
was supposed to play at Duquesne
last Wednesday and host
Georgetown last this Saturday.
While there has been no word

the rescheduling of the
Duquesne game, the Georgetown
game has been rescheduled for Nov.
6, which would make it the last
game of the season.

The game’s time and site has
not been announced, and if the
game does not affect the Big East
Championship seeding or on quali-
fying for the postseason, it will not
be played. _

The men’s team continues their
season tomorrow when they travel
to Morgantown to take on West
Virginia University. This will be the
second in—conference game of the
season for Pitt (0-1, 1-3), while it
will be the first for the
Mountaineers (0-0, 2-2).

Arefreshing dosage of real life without sports

For the last week, I wavered on
what to write about in this column.
Even though the sports world
returned to action on Monday, it
still felt too soon to be discussing a
pennant race and. a home run record
or touchdowns and field goals.

For some reason, I thought it
would be different.

I am ashamed to admit that at
first I was upset to hear that every
major sport would be shutting down
until Monday. I looked forward to
watching‘ something entertaining to
take my mind off of the horrible
events of last week.

But after taking a moment to

could do something to help. Since
I’m not a firefighter or a doctor, it
seemed that collecting money was
