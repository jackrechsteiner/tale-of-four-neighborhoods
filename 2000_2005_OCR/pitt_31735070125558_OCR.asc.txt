Antonio Bryant, Pitt’s star .All-
American wide receiver, was arrested

Monday morning at Pittsburgh International

Airport for allegedly using a plane ticket that
was purchased with a stolen credit card.
Bryant, who had returned from his U.S.
Airways ﬂight. to Fort Lauderdale, Fla,
where he was attending a charity clinic, was
immediately arrested and charged with
receiving stolen property, then arraigned. He
was released on his own recognizance after
the anaignment. ‘
Bryant, 20, who is from Miami, used a

round-trip ticket that was worth $1,263. The
ticket was purchased through Heather
Levine-’s debit card, in his name.

According to police documents, Levine
said she had not purchased the ticket for
Bryant, nor had she given Bryant permission
to use her card or any’ information contained

onthecardﬂratcouldbeusedtopurchasetheé

ticket.

' The ticket was purchased by phone on
the U.S. Airways ‘,‘800” system. A caller
-using the nameHughLapaixmadethe call
and, said Bryant would be picking up the

ticket Bryant showed identiﬁcation to pick '

up the ticket and was detained when he
retlnned fromhis-trip.

director of media relations, said ofﬁcials
knew of a situation regarding Bryant but
they are still in the “fact ﬁnding” stage.

“We believe strongly in Antonio
Bryant,” said Pitt head coach Walt  “I
willnot— and Ihope others will not — rush
to judgment until all the facts are in. We will
stand by Antonio and we hope his name will
be cleared when this situation is resolv .”

In a just more than a month, the grind begins again.
Fall classes resume Aug. 27 — a sobering morning for many
5 students whose summer has been less than academic. But in the
ﬁnal 32 days of summer, much fun is still available. .
Oakland boasts six city parks, including Schenley Park,
where twice-weekly movies continue for the duration of the sum-

mer. Smaller parks on Dunseith, Ophelia, Niagara and Frazier

streets provide playgrounds and ball ﬁelds — Frazier Field even
has a continuously ﬂowing fountain where local kids escape the
heat — but Schenley stands out as the city’s star in outdoor recre-
ation.
» And with a skating rink, golf course, conservatory, swimming
pool, track, ﬁelds, courts, bridle trails and numerous playgrounds
and pavilions, it’s little wonder. -
Schenley’s seven pavilions can accommodate anywhere from
30 to 170 people and can be rented for between $42 and $212.
Park—goer_s whose summer thirst is truly great — and who are
legally allowed to drink alcohol — can pay an additional $50 for
an alcohol permit which allows them to bring booze into the park.
But for those students whose summer daydrearns aremore
, aerobic than alcoholic, Pittsburgh Citiparks offers one ‘major
Oakland event that promises to spill at least a few beads of sweat.
According to Jim Kline, who works in Citiparks’ special
events division, this weekend’s Great Ride — the city’s armual
5-, 20-, 30- or 50—mile bike race — will draw more than 2,000 par-
ticipants. Expert cyclists and novices alike can register between
now and Sunday for a fee of $18. *

The races on July 29, scheduled to begin on the 300 block of
Second Avenue in Oakland, cover portions of the Eliza Furnace
Trail that runs along the Monongahela River between Oakland
and Downtown. The registration fee includes a T-shirt, rest stops
in three Pittsburgh parks, and food and beverages for all partici-
pants.
After the race bicyclists and onlookers alike can take a dip in
Schenley Pool, open every afternoon at 1 p.m., for a $4 admission
fee. . ‘ * “ '

And for those brave souls who venture out of Oakland in
search of summer distraction, weekly concerts in Mellon Square
Park continue through August. The free concerts, held Thursdays
at noon, feature bands such as 3 Car Garage, Dharma Sons and
Sporadic. ’ .

offered by Citiparks, visit the organization’s Web site at www.citi-

Crime-free Panthers: endangered?  

Commitment. Teamwork. Pride.

That’s what athletic director Steve
Pederson ordered as the athletic depart-'
ment’s motto in 1997. But not even
ﬁve years later, some of our highest-

. proﬁle athletes have chosen to not fol-

low this creed.

.Last week, 77 athletes were
named to the Big East Academic All-
Star team But notably, none came
from the football or men’s basketball

So out of more than l00‘members
of these teams, not a single one had a
QPA greater than 3.0.

What a disgrace. What a letdown
to the countless students who maintain
a 3.0 QPA or better while holding
down part-tirne jobs and cheering on
the football and men’s basketball teams
every week Why can’t our “star” ath-
letes adhere to these same standards?

Ironically, both the football and
men’s basketball teams continually
receive the most ftmding, the most stu- '

_ dent support and the most publicity.

Our money gives these athletes
massive scholarships. Yet they are not
exerting the same commitment to aca-
demics that most of us have to practice

every day.

The 77 who were honored are _

very praiseworthy. But there is no rea-
son they should be exception to the
rule.

Ironically, many of the honorees
come from the soccer, tennis and track
and ﬁeld teams, which cunently have
nowhere to play on campus, while the

men’s basketball and football teams
will soon play in gleaming, multimil-
lion dollar venues. .

Both the football and men’s bas-
ketball teams have also been plagued
by scandal in recent years.

There was the phone access code
scandal two years ago. That showed
teamwork, but not the laudable kind.

Recently, football player R.J.i

English was arrested for verbally
assaulting a police oﬂicer.

So much for pride.

And then came Monday’s news
that Antonio Bryant, Pitt’s star wide
receiver, had been arrested for receiv-
ing stolen property — a $1,235 airline
ticket bought with a stolen credit card.

Thisisnottheﬁrsttimehehas
been in trouble. Before the football
team’s spring camp, he was suspended
for confrontations with other players
and a coach and for missing ‘the team
photo.

What happened to his
ment, teamwork and pride? ’

Bryant is innocent until proven

commit-

guilty. But if proven guilty, he should A

be held accountable for his actions, no
matter how much of an impact ithas on
the team’s success on the ﬁeld

The 77 athletes on the academic
all-star team are role models for all.
Other coaches, especially football
coach Walt Harris, should require their
players to live up to their standards.

Commitment. Teamwork. Pride.
It’s about time all our athletes start ful-
ﬁlling this motto.

destruction anymore

In light of the anti-globalization
riots during this week’s Group of Eight
summit in Genoa, Italy, during which

, Carlo Giuliani, 23,'was killed by a gun--

shot to the head, I feel obligated to
defend my fellow anarchists. Mind you,
I don’t feel the need to defend the vio-
lence, which has been almost exclusive-
ly attributed to anarchist groups, but the
validity of their arguments against.cor-
porate globalization. .

Now, I’m not what you might imag-
ine an anarchist to be. My body ‘is
noticeably lacking any tattoos, I‘ lack
body piercings (though I’ve
had my ear pierced several
times, I’ve never managed to
prevent the hole from clos-
ing) and I don’t wear black
on a daily basis.

If this conﬂicts with the image that
comes to mind of an anarchist, I am will-
ing to bet-that your perception of their
political and economic views fall conve-
niently ‘into the media-manufactured
stereotypes as well. . . »

Countless times last weekend I heard
news commentators refer to anarchists
as being anti-democratic, anti-capitalist
and bent on instigating violence. Two
out of the three are simply incorrect
labels, and one is correct but misinter-
preted.

Anarchists are anti-authoritarian, not
anti-democratic.» They know and fear
that globalization is being spearheaded
by anti-democratic organizations like
the World Trade Organization, ‘the
International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank. .

These international governing bod-
ies are the anti-democratic forces in the
globalization debate, not the ‘anarchists.
They have not a single popularly elected

not subject to media access and they are-
controlled mainly by top-level execu-
tives from international corporations
who have the convenient responsibility
of policing themselves. '
Anarchists are anti-capitalist, but not
in the same sense as the hard-line com-
munists who frequented this and like
protests in Seattle, Quebec and Prague,
Czech Republic. While they share a
commitment to end the exploitation of
the proletariat with communists, they do
not share a remotely similar View of how
to remedy the situation.
' Communistsiseek a cen-
tralized, authoritarian gov-
ernment to control the means
of production, a plan that
anarchists deride for being’
more oppressive than the
current capitalistic alternative.
Anarchists are in fact the true liber-
tarians in the ‘tradition of the ideals — if
not the outcomes — of the French and
American ‘Revolutions. As Max S_tirner ,
once said, “By abolishing all private
property communism makes me even
more dependent on others, on the gener-
ality or totality [of society], and, in spite ‘
of its attacks on the State, it intends to
establish its own State  a state -of
affairs which paralyzes my freedom to
act and exerts sovereign authority over
me.” ‘ »
Thus we learn that the anarchist is
neither anti-capitalist in the convention-
al Cold War—era sense nor protectionist
as President George W. Bush would have
Americans believe. .
One can hardly seek protectionist V
policies when one refuses to accept the
sovereignty of the state in the first place-
"Finally, anarchists are, generally

Growing pains 

~ My life as a reallytall 7-year-old   

Saturday night, 11 p.m. I had just able by the childlike things I do than often feel strangely fresh and magical. I

returned from watching movies at__ aa
fri'end?s house. The night was 
and still relatively young, and 
myself suddenly bored. _.; i

a good time. _ j

I am not sure what motivated me
to do this. It wasn’t to make a profit
-—- definitely a good thing, since the
night yielded zero customers. A few
people passed by and shot me a smile
or look of confusion, but no one actu-
ally wanted to purchase a glass.

Why might a soon-to-be college
senior develop the idea that she must
have a lemonade stand? This is a
question that I struggle to answer.
And the lemonade stand is certainly
not my only recent act of immaturity.

Everyone has an inner child. I am
beginning to think that mine is terri-
bly hyperactive.

.Even when I am around people
my own age, I tend to feel significant-
ly younger. Perhaps it is because there
are certain things that most big people
do from which I refrain. I don’t curse.

I don’t do my own taxes. I drive
rarely and have pumped gas exactly
once.

r . I he good thing about being truly
young: at heartis that you have the
ample opportunity to laugh and make
other people laugh. Anyone whose

age is..s,till in the single digits is prone "
to collapsing into a fit of giggles at I-

any given moment. The "stimulus can
be something as simple as realizing
you have ‘a dab of spaghetti sauce

dog lick your toe. Little kids and
grown—up kids alike can easily appre-
ciate the humor of everyday life.
Conversely, children are inherent-
ly funny, I think mostly because they
are not afraid to laugh at themselves.
This is a quality I am trying desper-
ately to maintain. .When I am walking
around Oakland by myself, running
errands or going to class, I often start
laughing spontaneously over a stupid,
inconsequential thought that for some
reason makes me happy, like the day I

“comment you just made,”
-or “I look up to you and
want to ask you for advice
about something impor-

  

 tant” or “I really respect you and want

‘to know your opinion on this Serious

But when your friends are accus-
tomed to you opening your mouth
only to say things that are funny" or
silly, you create a trap for yourself,
making it very difficult for others to
_take_ you_seriously. -

lamusedby a childlike sense of ‘whim- -

romantic interest in a girl whose ideal
date would involve playing UNO and
eating lots of sugary snacks.
Ultimately, for better or for
worse, I know this is who I am: a 21-

year-old who still~ sleeps with a.

stuffed panda, loves Disney movies,
asks fellow college students what
grade they are in and occasionally
operates a highly unsuccessful lemon-

Minutes earlier, my friends had‘ teased me about my fear of

going off the diving board.

Not that I was afraid. I was merely embarrassed.

When was the last time you stood in line with a half dozen
people half yourage and half your height to wait your turn to run
down a slippery board and soar through the air like an awkward,
oversized, gratuitously naked bird into the water? Most college
students simply don’t go off the diving board any more; most of
them don’t even go to the community pool. '

But I really wanted to dive oﬂ that diving board.

No ﬂips or cannonballs or ﬂying leaps. I-merely wanted to
dive gracefully (or not) oil‘ the board and feel the cool blue water

_ rush past my face. _

So I did, and harkened back to days when summertime enter-
tainment was so much simpler.

Today, summertime entertainment for college students seems
to be limited to going to movies, bowling or miniature golf. Or sit-
ting in a coffee shop and proving your intellectualism as you dis-
cuss the art ﬁlm you saw Friday. I suppose going to bars and par-
ties ﬁgures into that mix, too. .

But when was the last time you turned your living room into
a tent or painted your body with war paint and ran around the
neighborhood chasing your friends?

One muggy summer afternoon about 13 years ago, my sisters
and I fashioned paper bag dresses for ourselves and took silly pic-
tures; I like to think we were inventing new ways to recycle. My
dad took one of those pictures to work to show his boss and ask
for a raise. ,

In addition to paper bag dresses, we also possessed an arse-
nal of oversized glam dress—up clothes. It wasn’t until our feet
grew too big for every pair of metallic heels from the ‘60s that we
truly appreciated our collection. .

We especially missedthat collection of kitschy dress-up gear

 when we moved on to our home vidw “talk show” stage and

dressed as an Oprah or a Sally Jesse Raphael mimic and inter-
viewed one of our friends or cousins dressed as a glamorous
movie star.

After supper, as the day wound down, we played all varia-
tions of ‘ g” in the backyard until we were too dirty to go to
without a bath. . ‘

I. don’t even remember the last time I was so obviously dirty
it was apparent I needed to bathe. .

I thought about all these things as I bobbed up ﬁom the bot-
tom of the pool and swam back toward my friends, languidly
lounging by the side of the pool in the shallow "section.

And I got out of the water and got back in line at the board.

Senior Staff Writer -

The most decidedly convincing and altogether cor-
rect choice director Francois Ozon made in his new
drama “Under the Sand” is his use of microphones to
pick up every possible sound in the area

_That’s because “Sand” isn’t about peo-
ple talking or chemistry between charac-
ters, but about one woman’s ‘personal
struggles. For this portrayal, a deep sense of -
silence is important; the mere sounds of the
woman’s daily life acquire extreme value.

Charlotte Rampling —— still a tremendous and
beautiful actress — plays Marie Drillon, a middle-aged
wife married nearly 25 years to her husband Jean.
Unlike most ﬁlm couples these days, Marie and Jean
are still in love and still maintain a functional marriage.
At the start of the ﬁlm, the couple departs for their year-
ly summer vacation at the beach.

. On the ﬁrst day of their hiatus, they decide to
spend a day on the beach tanning, swimming and read-
ing. Jean asks his wife if she would like to go swim-
ming, and Marie replies that she wants to take a quick

nap ﬁrst. When she awakes, Jean is nowhere in Marie’s -

range of vision.

b He has disappeared. .
The movie continues with Marie’s struggles to let

‘kit

go, to step out of a state of denial and tell herself that
Jean is gone. She must decide to allow others to help
her mourn and to learn to love others.

It is in these scenes that the haunting absence of
dialogue intrigues the audience.

Rampling, who appears in every scene, and alone
in most of them, is fully prepared to show Marie’s pain
in new and true ways. _

Marie overcomes her sorrow not through a sloppy
mess of tears, but through laughter and fatigue, anger
and love, routines and visions of her husband that will
end as soon as she stops creating them.

Rampling’s startling performance touches the very -

core of the disappointment of loss — be it of money, a

prized object or the love of your life —— in a way

that seems to portray a new theme rather

 ' than one tl1at’s age-old. The supporting

1 a cast is often left in die dust and unable to

elevate their performances past cliche.

And as if a wonderful performance

isn’t enough, Rampling speaks throughout the ﬁlm in

two languages, her native English and a convincing

French. Often she will change in mid-conversation just
as her character — also born a Brit —— might do.

But, alas, one person can only do so much. Ozon
often makes decisions that only detract from
Rampling’s work, instead of enhancing it, such as by
using cuts that are too distracting or gratuitous nudity.

Still, he manages a rather solid job throughout. It
would take belligerent sabotage to ruin the highlight of
“Under the Sand” that is Charlotte Rampling.

titles. It is playing exclusively at Pittsburgh p

“The Crucible”

Directed by Timothy Douglas
O’Rei1ly Theater

HEATHER BOWLAN

Staff Writer

It is a difficult test of any company’s
skill. to produce ‘The Crucible,” Arthur
Miller’s classic play that is as famous for its
length as for its thinly veiled references to
the Communist witch hunt of the 1950s.

The Pittsburgh Public Theater’s
Young Company, a group mostly -
comprised of college and grad- 
uate students, has taken on the
challenge and their production  
demonstrates the difficulties of the
play as well as its ultimate rewards.

Written in 1953, Miller’s workis a trea-
tise against the abuse of morality to further
personal power. Set in Salem, Mass., during
the 1692 witch trials, “The Crucible” frames
the hysteria of the incident around the after-
math of an affair between a farmer, John
Proctor (Chris Cardenas), and the local
Reverend’s niece, Abigail Wrﬂianrs (Kelly
Tnrmbull). While the basic facts of the
witch trials are known to anyone who has
taken American history, Miller brings the

  
 
   

THEPHTNEWS

horror and irrationality of the event to life
through his characters.

Trurnbull’s Abigail and her fellow girl-
ﬁiend conspirators perfectly capture the
adolescent desire for attention and the talent

for manipulation that made high school (and -

the movie “Heathers”) so memorable.
Jonny Petersen as the priggish

Reverend Parris, so desperate for control,

andrespect of his parish, and guest actor
David Nevell’s Deputy Governor Danforth,

‘ whose justice is only blind to reason, are

convincing adult parallels to the scheming
girls.

But the standout here is Cardenas as
Proctor, the farmer who refuses to compro-
mise his morals at any point and so pays ﬂre
price. Cardenas keeps Proctor honest with-
out becoming righteous, and delivers lines
that could easily be over the top with a

resigned air, making a quieter but more
profound impact on the audi-
- ence.
Cardenas has such a pres-
. N  ence on the stage that it is easy
to ignore the few ﬂaws of this pro-
duction. While Petersen’s Reverend Panis
has the right air of haughty indignation, he
seems awkward moving about ﬂre stage.
Indeed, much of the blocking seems choppy
and mechanical. This is key, because with
the scenes of the play running so long, and
with tension building rather subtly through
the ﬁrst act, the moyements of the actors are
crucial to keeping the audience’s attention.

. Andrea Shockling’s set is sparse, as are

‘Janice Zeller’s costumes, which provide a
rather timeless feel, but don’t succeed on all

stand-up, not to mention that of
comedy and reality material.

Jeff Davis, Lance Krall, Mary
Lynn Rajskub and Wanda Sykes are
the featured players, a cast that
plays a little like “Saturday Night
Live,” incorporating a little “Mad

keep everything lightly ludicrous.

The rest of the inspiration and

entertainment is provided by men p

and women on the street who are
asked to weigh in on the “downer”
in question, offer their personally
relevant horror stories or somehow
contribute either knowingly or
unknowingly.

The effect is less cathartic and
more Monty Python-meets-Andy
Rooney at a screening of “The Jerk.”

“The Downer Channel” is a
blended version of a lot of familiar
shows and styles. And though it has
its edgy moments, where taste seems
about to ﬂy out the window, “The
Downer Channel” is actually a
mainstream show. Sure, the program
caters to a nation suffering en masse
from attention-deficit disorders,
with no segment lasting more than
90 seconds. But the point of View is
so broad-based the jokes generally
fall into the middle of the road.

A slice-of-life or two is seen in a

chologically abuse their children by

ducers of “The Downer Channel” is

receiver to class of 2002

KENNETH PAUL

Walt Harris got the quarterback he
wanted for his 2002 class when Pitt
received a verbal commitment from West
Allegheny’s Tyler Palko. Now he has his
coveted wide receiver, Billy Gaines.

Gaines, who gave a verbal commit-
ment to Pitt last week, will be ﬁnishing
his senior year at Urbana High School in
Frederick, Md. The 5-foot-8-inch, 165-
pound receiver is extremely fast, nmning
the 40-yard dash in 4.22 seconds.’

Gaines caught 32 balls last season
for a total of 528 yards and six touch-
downs. He chose Pitt over Virginia and
West Virginia. '

The newest "member of the 2002
class can also play defensive back, but he
has been recruited as a receiver and spe-
cial teams return man. . '

. He joins Palko, Andy Alleman and
David Abdul as the ﬁrst four recniits of
the 2002 class. Alleman is a 6-foot-5-
inch, 235-pound linebacker and fullback,
and Abdul is a kicker. Both hail from
Massillon High School in Ohio.

All four recruits must wait until
February before they can sign a binding
letter of intent.

Pitt women’s soccer goalie Rachel
Brown has been chosen as the Big East
preseason goalkeeper of the year.

Brown, a senior, was selected as the
2000 Big East goalkeeper of the year
and was also named to the preseason
All-Big East Team, which is selected by
the conference’s 14 coaches.

“It’s great for the team and the
University,” said Pitt head coach Roland

ors, which is proof of the types of play-

Last year was a honid year for me as far

Even more amazingly, they have done
this without any major free agent signings
and with the lowest payroll in baseball.

InspiteofbeingaTwir1sfan,Icanbare-
ly name anyone on the team’s roster.

The Twins, as well as the Phillies and
A’ s, two other low budget teams, seem to be
everyone’s Cinderella team. Here they are, a
team with no-name players who have come
together with all their hearts and souls,
putting aside individual eifort for the com-
mon good —— and winning.

But enough of the cliches to describe the
Twins. Being a great team of no-names is
ﬁne and dandy. Are the Twins bad for base-
ball?

Sure, seeing low budget teams sudden-
ly winning may help basebal1’s popularity
with those who feel that ﬂie game is only
about big-name players and owners making
a lot of money and ripping oﬁ the fans while
they’re at it '

In the shortrun, the Twins’ and Phillies’ A

success may help baseball. But in the long
run, it may hurt.
pAsmuchofaTwinsfanasIam,partof
me wishes they were having a season like
the Pirates are. Why?
' Next year, some of the debates tem-
porarily settled by the strike of 1994 —
including revenue sharing among teams or
the possibility of a salary cap — will be
revisited.

In other sports, salary caps have helped
maintain the competitive balance. In the
NFL, teams from small markets like the
Steelers, Saints, Ravens and even the
Packers from little Green Bay, VV1s., 
300,000), can and do compete with teams
whose owners have deep pockets and large
markets like Jerry Jones’ Cowboys.

Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, who
also owns the Milwaukee Brewers, a small
market team, has argued heavily for revenue

sharing. But owners like Steinbrenner argue '

that every team should be responsible for
raising its own revenue, and tough luck for
those teams that can’t. .
Unfortunately, the  and ‘Phillies
have provided fodder for those who oppose
revenue sharing. Because of them, one could

' argue that small market teams can compete

with small payrolls and no revenue sharing.
That school of thought prevailing will
damage baseball in the long-run.
After going through this ”moral debate

guys this year to help the good guys in the '

“I was very pleased with the number
of talented swimmers and divers we
signed,” Knoles said. “This class will be

another that adds to Pitt’s tradition of .

excellence.”

will make his impact in the 200—meter
freestyle, while Bast, a member of the
Pennsylvania state champion water polo
team, was an AH-American swimmer in
1997 and is a talented diver. .

“Brian is a great all-around swim-
mer,” Knoles said. “He comesto us with
U.S. Open time standards in the 100-
meter butterﬂy, 200-meter breast stroke,
200 IM and 400 IM. His versatility will
be very valuable to our program.”

Boone spent
Mercersburg Academy and brings quick-
ness to the 1-meter board.

‘ “Dustin’s strength on the board is a 2
1/2 twist in the tuck position on the 1-,
meter,” Knoles» said. “That dive placed

 him second in the state championships,

and we feel he’s'a great addition to our
diving program.”

' Brush was a two-time ﬁrst—team All-
Big 12 swimmer at the University of
Nebraska before joining Pitt. Grinstead
was a two—year section diving champion
while in high school and Empire State
Games participant. -

Hand was a member of the three-
time WPIAL champion Bethel Park
team.

Kilroy was a three-time All-
American in the 200 and 400 free relays
during his high school tenure in
Allentown, Pa.

Kohnke joins junior Max Von
