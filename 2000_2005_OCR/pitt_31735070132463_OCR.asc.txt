Budget cuts didn’t quite stop Great Race

JULIE BACHALIS '
Staff Writer

The memories were too good
and the tradition too strong for the
Richard S. Caliguiri/City of
Pittsburgh Great Race to fade away
simply because of a cut to the city
budget.

It survived for a 27th year,
although its form was markedly
dilferent. , _

 The Great Replacement Race
took place in Schenley Park last
Sunday, the same day for which the
original was scheduled. Also like
the original, it featured boththe 5-
K and the 10-K event

Missing, however, were the
oﬂicial race for juniors, the 5—kilo-
meter walk and the competition

. categories for wheelchairs, teams,

heavyweights and costumes. The
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation was the
featured beneﬁciary of the race. _.

' . The 5-K began at 8:30 am,

and the 10-K at 9 am. Both races’

started and. ﬁnished at Phipps
Conservatory. The route, which 10-

K racers. repeated, looped through

Schenley Park and surrounding ‘

roads.
Dedicated runners and com-
munity entrepreneurs worked hard

' since early August to organize the.

substitute race. It was then that
Mayor Tom Murphy armounced

the closing of the Citiparks Olﬁce‘

of Special Events, the government
agency that funded the Great
Race_,because of the city’s ﬁnancial
The closing of the office also
put an end to several other tradi-
tional city events, including the
_2003 tree-lighting ceremony
downtown, the 2004 Fourth of July
celebration at Point State Park, and

Furka moves. to  
Residence Life

J. ELIZABETH STROHM AND
GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Report

I Newly appointed Director of
Residence Life Deborah Furka

came to Pitt ﬁve and a half years _ -

ago to work as police chief.
Several years later, she
became the director of public
safety — a seemingly natural
transition to a position that she
will continue to ﬁll until Oct 1.
She will leave the position to
take on the role of director of

- , Residence Life — a less intuitive

transition — to ﬁll a job left open
when former assistant to the dean
for Residence Life "Denine
Rocco resigned July 25. _

' ‘Although he originally
opened the search for a new
director to outside applicants,
Dean . of Students Jack Daniel
said he decided to look at people
already employed at Pitt, after he

receivedsome applications from

“strong internal candidates.”
y. “I needed someone who was

‘ well experienced in dealing with

crises,” Daniel said, explaining
that Furka has frequenﬂy dealt
with students’ problems during

‘her time -at Pitt.

Daniel ' added that many
health and safety issues arose last
year, both in residence halls and
in fraternity houses. p

“Parents are ‘very concerned
with health and safety issues,”

. said Daniel, who is also vice

provost forundergraduate stud-
ies. - .
In addition to her. role in
public safety, Furka helped to

-» -review and construct recommen-

dations last year for improving

Pitt’s Greek and student advising

systems.
- - Those recommendations are
now being used to make “vast

improvements” to the Greek sys-
tem, Daniel said, adding that he
also anticipated “vast,improve-

ments for Residence Life at Pitt,” '

with Furka’s help.

“Deborah is very experi-
enced in managing diversity and
bringing diversity to her unit,”
Daniel said, explaining that
diversity at Pitt is reﬂected in the
daily issues in Residence Life
and'Student Affairs.

“We have a tremendously
experienced person,” Daniel said
of Furka.

Many of the issues ‘facing
people in Residence Life remain
the same on any campus, Furka
said, including a “global respon-
sibility for growth and develop-
ment of the students within the
residence halls, and taking the
residence halls and the students
through that growth.” 9’;

 But she added that Pitt’s

‘ urban campus adds more dimen-

sions to‘ the role of Residence
Life. 5 I ‘

“We-have to be more cre-
ative, but,it -also gives students
more opportunity to go out and
explore,” Furka said of Pitt’s sur-
roundings. “Policing ‘a college
campus in an urban environment

is diﬂ’erent.”

Furka pointed out that her
recent positions might not indi-
cate any experience in Residence
Life, but she explained that her
role in Residence Life as a stu-
dent" at Kent State, combined
with her time dealing with st11-

- dents through her security roles

at Pitt, has given her a good deal
of experience in the ﬁeld.
Furka’s change in position
might seem,near1y as abrupt as
Rocco’s summer resignation
from the position,-, but Rocco

Dinner opens Youth
Empowerment events

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

Under the soft glow of the
chandelier in the Vlfrlliam Pitt
Union ballroom, people dined on
lobster bisque and breaded chick-
en breast while conversing with
one another about the state of the
community in today’s society

This Friday night dinner was
the kick-off for the ﬁrst annual
Youth Empowerment Weekend,

- organized by community outreach

chairperson K Chase Patterson
and sponsored by the Black Action
Society.

After Patterson’s introduc-
tions, BAS President Vanessa
Gerideau spoke about the state of
black communities around the
country and the world. She said
more people should help today’s
youth achieve their goals.

Sharae Bryant spoke on
behalf of the Freedom Honor
Society, reiterating that the honor
society —— the ﬁrst minority honor
society at Pitt — works to help out
the community. She also described

its commitment to improving the
lives of the people it serves.

Next to speak were local high
school students, who addressed
topics ranging from various diﬂi-
culties in the community today to
their hopes for a better future.

One student could not ﬁnd the
words to speak after he came to the
lectem. The audience clapped and
cheered for him twice in encour-
agement, providing an example of
how important community is in
each person’s life.

When the student found the
courage to speak, Waynica Mclean
of the Oﬂice of Admissions and
Financial Aid, who is also a stu-
dent at Pitt, gave him some of her
time.

Rep. Jake Wheatley, D-
Allegheny County, was the
keynote speaker for the evening.

Wheatley, who grew up. in

experiences in that urban setting.
He said that after some difficult

Festival gives science human face

MICHELLE SCOTT
Staff Writer

Distinguished scientists, fac-
ulty members, students and
administrators listened wide—eyed
as biologist Susan Lindquist
explained how understanding pro-
tein folding may lead to treatments
for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
disease.

Later, nearly the entire audi-
ence — from eminentscientists to
undergraduates — poured out of
the auditorium and rushed down-
stairs for a_ pizza lunch.

Academic researchers, indus-
trial scientists, business people
and science lovers from around
the country came to ‘Pitt’s
Science2003 festival to discuss

new research developments re1at-‘ ’
. ing to this

year’s theme,
“Improving the I -Human
Condition.” The third annual festi-

val, which was. held last
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday

' in Alumni Hall, also put a human

face on the process of scientiﬁc
research by providing a social
environment where scientists
could meet and discuss their ideas.

This year’s theme celebrated
how scientists at Pitt and in the
overall Pittsburgh community are
developing new ways to detrxst,
control and eradicate disease, Dr.
Arthur Levine, senior vice chan-
cellor for the health sciences and

dean of the School of Medicine, '

explained via e—mail.

He also mentioned that other
local scientists are making
advancements in developing com-
puter technology and exploring
the human mind. ‘ 

The speakers, who came
from all over the United States,
highlighted this topic by dis-
cussing emerging themes in med-

icine, ecology and chemistry. For
instance, J eﬂiey Friedman, pro-
fessor at Rockefeller University in
New York, discussed his discov-
ery of leptin, a hormone that regu-
lates body fat, and its implications

for obesity.

David Suzuki, professor at
the Sustainable Development
Research Institute at the
University of British Columbia,
discussed his experiments, which
demonstrated temperature-sensi-
tive mutations in fruit ﬂies. This
may suggest that the environment
could directly contribute to genet-
icmutation —- possibly through
global warming. t,‘ V

of biology at MIT who discussed
how the way amino acids fold into
proteins can inﬂuence a person’s

IS CIRCUMCISIO

ETHICAL???

America is the only country in the world
where the medical establishment
- circumcises the majority of newborn
boys, even though the procedure is not
-recommended by any
national/international medical
organization--and some strongly oppose
it. Discuss the ethical considerations of
amputating a normal, healthy body part

Wright ﬂight remembered

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer‘

From the role of precipitation in the

construction of aircraft to the fact that an 18- ‘

year old Wilbur Wright lost several teeth in
a hockey accident, all kinds of interesting
facts about aviation history surprised and
enlightened the crowd in Benedum
Auditorium last Wednesday.

In honor of the 100-year anniversary of

. the Wright brothers’ historic ﬁrst ﬂight, Pitt

and Carnegie Mellon University held a
symposium in which four experts lectured
on the Wrights and important events in avi-
ation history.

The symposium concluded a day-long

celebration of the Wright centennial.
Throughout the day, CMU displayed a full-
size replica of the Wright’s plane on its

lawn. Meanwhile, in Posvar Hall, Pitt low-

ered Aerodrome #6, an early aircraft
designed by one-time Pitt professor Samuel
Langley in 1896. The invention usually
hangs from ceiling the of Posvar.

The ﬁrst speaker at the symposium, -

CMU engineering professor’ Dr. Arthur
Davidson, gave a brief biography of the
Wrights. He not only spoke of their ﬂight
expeditions,-but also presented trivia about
the Wrights — like the hockey injury.

Next, Dr.W1lliarn Soifa, a Pitt professor
of materials science and engineering,
described the importance of another devel-
opment in ﬂight technology that is marking
its centennial: the discovery of precipitation
hardening.

“It’s the reason you can sit and drink
your Coke and eat your pretzels and not
have to worry about the plane falling apart,”
he said of the process.

In precipitation hardening, metals are
soaked in water and heated in a ﬁrmace.
They then become ﬁrmer while cooling.
According to Soﬁa," the process is essential
for producing materials that are sturdy but
light, like the metals that make up modem-
day aircraft. .
. Third to speak was Nick Engler, direc-
tor of the Wright Bros.‘Aeroplane Company
in Dayton, Ohio. The company does not
 build commercial airplanes,’ but
reconstructs the Wrights’ design for educa-
tional purposes and runs a museum dedicat-
ed to the brothers. ,- ’

“The Wright story is extremely inspir-
ing to young minds,” Engler said. “They
were two uneducated kids with no money

who achieved a 500—year-old dream.”

Vrsibly enthusiastic, Engler gave --an
hour and 15 minute presentation on the
mechanics of the Wright plane and his
company’s efforts to reproduce it, while
paying little heed to Davidson tapping on
his watch.

The last speaker, James Tobin, author
of “To Conquer the Air: The Wright
Brothers and the Great Flight Race,” com-
pared and contrasted Samuel Langley and
the Wrights. -The historian argued that
Langley represented all that could be disad-
vantageous about education and prestige,
while the Wrights represented the value of
ingenuous adventurism and spirit.

loidosis, a rare disease in which vital organs

‘ are overcome with protein deposits. .The

1993, making the Richard S. Caliguiri.

“I’m glad for the Replacement Race,
but it’s just not the same,” John Kersey of the
North Hills said “I loved that [the Caliguiri
race] was allonthe openroad—no paths or
anything like Schenley.”

Other residents believed the
Replacement Race should have had another
name.

“What is it replacing?” asked Marcus
Westow, whose Oakland home was on the
route of the race. “It isn’t replacing anything.
Nothing can replace that race.”

“It was really phenomenal,” Shadyside
resident Daniel Nocera said of the original
race. The 25-year-old Pitt alumnus is a life-
long resident of the city and ran the event
ﬁve times during his days in cmss—country
track.

‘The entire community just came

together. You had some people doing it

because they were serious runners, others
doing it as a personal challenge, and families
just running for 

Nocera wondered whether the city’s
marathon will be the next event to lose its
flmding. ’

“I lmew the city was in a state of bank-
ruptcy,” he said, “but this makes you realize
in a very direct way just how serious that sit-
uation 

Mayor Ca1iguiri’s son, David Caliguiri,
never missed a race since‘ its dedication to his
father. To David Caliguiri, the Great Race
became a living memorial of his father’s
vision for Pittsburgh.

He said he is disappointed by its cancel-
lation, mostly because he thinks it reﬂects
upon the poor state of the city’s economy.

“In a sense it’s ﬁustrating, but at the
same time I can understand,” he said. “I
think my father would have supported the
money spent on the opening of the
Convention Center, because it is vital to the
city.” 1
. The son of the late mayor said he will do
everything in his power to bring back the
original Great Race next year. ‘

ment’ about any of our races,” Briel said

At Lindquist’s lecture, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg added that four Dickson
prize winners have gone on to win the Nobel
prize.

Scientists from Carnegie Mellon

University and Pitt also held “Spotlight

Sessions,” to discuss hot research topics
ranging from new microscopic and comput-
er technologies to infectious agents and vac-
cine development

But Science2003 wasnft all talk.
Between the lectures and presentations,
many attendees stopped by the Trade Show,
where they couldchow down on ice cream,
pizza and hoagies, and take a look at the new

‘ research gadgets and talk with their devel-

opers.

Jim - Mattison, a representative from
Pierce Biotechnogies, said that he enjoyed
the opportunity to have discussions’ with the
scientists who use his products. A

‘”Ihere’s a lot of exposure to the scien-
tists who do exactly this every day in the
lab,” he said.  i -

The festival’s larger social activities ‘

included the opening night reception and
Wednesday’s “First Look Technology
Showcase,” which displayed new technolo-
gies developed by researchers at Pitt and
CMU that are now available for licensing.

The organizers also put together a

“Science Roc ” barbeque on the Cathedral

Lawn on Thursday.

“One of the goals of Science2003 is to
give all of us who work in science a much
broader opportunity than we have on a day-
to-day basis to meet and share ideas with
other scientists, as well as with people who
support science and share a love of science,”
Levine added in his e-mail. “On a larger
scale, our intent is to make the University of
Pittsburgh a regional showcase of 21st cen-
tury science and technology.”

“interesting.”

The change in title will not,-be the only

Daniel said that the past year had
taught him a‘"good deal about students —
primarily about the quality and hours of

Qualified new director of Student Life

In a commendable move relating

to student safety, the University has
named a former Pitt police chief and
current director of public safety as
the director of Residence Life.
I The selection of Deborah Furka,
effective Oct. 1, to the revised’
directorial position demonstrates a
commitment to the quality of stu-
dent life — something that the
University has been lacking.

Furka has a master’s degree in
Educational Administration from
Kent State University, where, as an
undergraduate and as a graduate stu-
dent, she was involved in Residence
Life, holding positions similar to
that of Pitt’gs Residential Assistant
and Residential Director. As the

. chief of Pitt police, she supervised

101 officers. She also completed
last year's extensive review of
Greek life —— a potentially inflam-
matory task that she handled with

' relative aplomb.

‘These aspects of her career
highlight managerial acumen, "a
commitment to public safety and
sensitivity indealing with students
e- three obvious qualiﬁcations for a
position -overseeing dorm life.

Her experience as director of

. public safety is reassuring to stu-

dents and parents alike — no one
can learn from or experience college

 ,_li,fe  they donlt feel safe, and hav--

ing a_former police Chief in charge
of Residence Life isa huge st-ride
toward making consumers of dorm
life feel secure. ..

Supervisory experience over an
entire police force will translate

well into organizing a staff of RAs ‘

and RDs. Not only does Furka have
the tools to motivate and regulate a
staff, but the fact-that her experi-
ence is with law enforcement may
encourage a very safety-oriented
and law-abiding approach to man-
agement. -

The only question marring
Furka’s appointment is the change
in the title — and, likely, pay and
beneﬁts — of the position itself.
Previously, Denine Rocco held the
position of assistant to the dean for
Residence Life, which was not a
directorial position at the time,
though the equivalent_position was
prior to her employment, and is
now.

To revamp Rocco’is position
after she _resigned July 25 to work at
the University of Akron is, accord-
ing to Rocco herself, “interesting,”
to say the least. While no employer
should have to .make public the
details of personnel decisions, inthe
interest of transparency of the
administration, such an overhaul of
a position. should be accompanied
by at least some explanation.

We all have dreams. I’d like to bean

look at the universe from outside the

Neapolitan ice cream and try to convince
one of the female astronauts to have sex

_ Unfortunately, the dreams only wor
in the sanctuary of my head. Outside,'in
the crap, I have to ' work low-paying,
part-time jobs. Last summer, I found
myself gazing into the swirling depths of

- a mop bucket. The pail had a bottom

but so does my life, and I’m
just trying to ﬁll it with .
something good before I hit
the ﬂoor. So, in order to
afford the college life, over
the summer I became a jani-
tor at my old high school.

. I’ve had my ﬁngers in
all kinds of mild to severe
cleaning products. I’ve han-

    

and morons. After I worked with them, 
realized I was just a judgmental idiot.
Janitors are regular people like you and
me. Most are literate-, and they think
about things other than waxing ﬂoors
and pornography. That’s a lot more than
I can. say about myself sometimes. No,
children, janitors aren’t losers —-— they’re
just people who have a job that sucks.
Imagine waking up before six in the
morning and cleaning. feces-encrusted
toilets ﬁrst thing. Then you’d get to deal
with other people condescending to you
all day — in my case, school administra-
tors -and teachers, telling you
what a good job you did on
the bathroom ﬂoor while not
even trying to hide the smirk
on their face. As a janitor,

There is a deﬁnite stigma surround-

I’d run into old teachers and they’d
always ask me what I was doing. When
I’d tell them that I was a janitor at the
high" school, their eyes would glaze over
a little, like they were looking just
beyond me. They’d start talking to me in
pronounced, simple sentences as if I
were a child. If you clean up other peo-

~ ple’s messes for a living, you must auto-

Dearest freshmen, how are you faring in this strange new world?

So, chilluns, has it really been a
month already? An entire month of a
new semester. How’s it been, eh little
ones? Not too bad, I hope. I remem-
ber well the
difficulties
of the (not
so) diligent
student in

    

the early

years. Yes,l

too know

the hang- 
frvtfsrtratailgiii JP’ Fndy
y0u,re an Columnist
f e e l i n g

now.

I remember it well, my freshman
year. Quite honestly,.it was a com-
plete debacle. Alas, but it’s true.
Even I have known humbling defeat.
What a horrible effect it has, resign-
ing yourself to never going to class!
I can still remember the lame, cow-
ardly way I informed my parents of
my academic failures. But I digress.

If I recall correctly, laundry is the
bane of all existence. How many of
you are sitting here right now in pink
underwear? Ah, I could’ve guessed,
comrades. The sheer number of
blushing faces belies the truth. And,
judging from the small crowd of
frantic-looking people that just bolt-
ed from their seats, nearly as many of
you have forgotten your now—sodden
laundry languishing in that mildew-
breeding farm of a washer.

Oh, and how could .I forget the
joy that is living._.on campus? Then
again,,I wouldr1’t. quite know. I did,
afterjall, stay as far away as possible
from my closet-like room. Primarily

a. depository for my multitudinous ’

stuff, it quickly.,became a blighted
wasteland of tenuously “stacked
clothes, papers, and books. '

Nestled safely behind my fortifi-
cations of forgotten homework and
soiled dainties, .I would often inad-
vertently let the dayspass me by, only
to wake up in a twilit daze to man the
.battlements in futile search of. my
latest,.__a_ss_ignments. My feeble
attempts atidoing schoolwork never
amounted to much in that cursed
room. If anything, it sucked the _pro—
ductivity right out of me. That is,
unless you consider the irresistible
urge to fornicate productive.

Ah, productivity. At long last,
I’Ve come to terms with this ever-
elusive concept. Would that I hadn’t!
My life now isifilled with such a vol-
ume of reading, assignments that I
can. scarcekeep up. Each week,

_p another paper gleefully pilfers sever-

al..precious.hours. of sleep. And the
days of term paper research now
loom ominously close. Aha! You

there, marching to class with a lead-
en shuffle and a glazed stare! You
know what I’m talking about. Come,
kinsman! I know just what you need.
Take this beer and drizzle copiously
down your.throat until empty. Buy
more, and repeat at least thrice daily.

All this productivity has clearly
affected my judgment. It came to the
point where I just couldn’t be satis-
fied with being a diligent student
with leisure time. No, that would
never do. I had to complicate things
further, and get myself involved in
—— shudder —— activities. In what can
only be described as a brain _fart, I

actually chose to sacrifice several
hours a week to the greater integrity
of the University and myself. My
former slacking self is weeping for-
lornly in the dusty cobwebbed cor-
ners of my subconscious.

Well, boys and girls, there is a
moral to all of this. Despite the con-
spicuous lack of free time, which
manifests itself in a moratorium on
social interaction and basic hygiene,
I’m a happier, better person for all of
this. I no longer feel like a worthless,
stagnant schlub. I no longer agonize
over the legions of unfinished

assignments cursing my lineage from .

homework limbo. And, most impor-
tantly, skipping class to sip scotch is
no longer accompanied by wracking
guilt.

So, hie thee to class, littluns, and
take comfort in knowing that it gets
easier the more you do it. And
please, never forget that sometimes
social/chemical/carnal distractions
are way more important than your
three o’clock recitation.

he’s still a slacker; you’re probably

right. He can be reached at

Cultivate a stable of stallions for gratification

Dear Sex N’at,

I have a problem. I like sex. In fact, I like it '

a lot I would like to have more of it, but am
unable to do so for a couple of reasons. I don’t ’
want a boyfriend, and I do not want to have ran-
dom sex with random partners. When I ﬁnd
someone I think I might like to have sex with,
they tell me they need to be in a relationship,
are not ready or are (gasp) a  I mastur-
bate a lot, but right now, it just isn’t enough; I
miss having another person involved. What do
you suggest I do?

Lonely in the bedroom
Dear Lonely:

Wait, liking sex is a problem? Uh uh, girl-
friend. Liking sex is great; it’s a sign of life —
don’t let anyone ever tell you dilferently. I’ll bet
you can’t go to a lot of your friends with this
concem, lest they place a scarlet “S,” for “slut,”
on you. That’s bull. Just because you don’t want
a relationship doesn’t mean you have to become
best pals with your vibrator. I mean, you should
be pals with him (does he have a name?) any-
way, but he’ll understand that you need variety. —

On to getting you laid.

You don’t need to be in a Relationship, but
you do need to be in a relationship — or rela-
tionships. As in, you need to have a level of trust
and perhaps ﬁiendship — at least a level of
courtesy in terms of booty-call etiquette — with

 

 

the men you are going to put in your stable of
stallions. ' ' *

You need to cultivate a stable of eligible
sets of genitals, and you need an understanding
with the boys attached to them. As long as
everyone involved is quite sure of the parame-
ters of the lower-case “1” relationship, it’s ﬁne.
Find a few gorgeous
boys and. explain to
them right off the bat
that you just want a
friendly, booty-call
basis for friendship —
no more, no less.

Insist that they get
tested for sexually
transmitted infections,
and insist that they
wear condoms. You
aren’t going to be monogamous, so you can’t
expect them to be, and thus their clean bills of
health aren’t necessarily going to be permanent.

Come up with some protocol. For instance,
you have to agree beforehand not to get upset if
one of you shoots the other down on a given
occasion. We are, after all, trying to get educa-
tions here, too, so blasted schoolwork may get
in the way. .

Where can you ﬁnd these boys? I’d recom-
mend against drafting all but the most mature of
your male friends. When there is a pre-existing
relationship, things tend to ’ get complicated,
despite the best of intentions.

I’d recommend an advanced screening process.
Don’t.go home with anyone while drunk. Do
get phone numbers and make lunch—date inter-
views withthem. Then, if they meet your crite-
ria, draft ‘em. ‘

they should make you gasp, but in a good way.

“If money can’t buy happiness,
I guess I’ll have to rent it.”
Weird Al Yankovic.

Say “video game rental” to your
average Joe Gamer on campus and
he’ll recall painful memories about
the store down the street that
offered a terrible selection of games
at astronomical prices, and was
staffed by people who didn’t know
Genesis from their elbow.

Times have changed: Not only
do the major movie-rental chains
keep their game racks up to snuff
these days, but all sorts of online
sites offer rentals to the gaming
public for cut-rate prices.

The averagevideo game these
days costs somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of $40-$50, a hefty price
for the typical impoverished college
student. While there certainly are
many games that warrant spending
this much money, many of them
offer the typical “groundbreaking
game” front, while the only ground
broken is the hole it should be
buried in. As such, it makes good
sense to try out a game that you
might have heard some harsh words
about, or that you’re not sure you’ll
enjoy. Fortunately, your options for
renting said game are numerous.

The most obvious option is
good old Blockbuster. For six

bucks, you can keep the game of"

your choice for a
week. That

resorts to telling jokes
merely for shock value.
He instead aims for the
warm smile of recognition
or the knowing chuckle,
and doesn’t shy away
from inside jokes that will
be funniest to his fellow
Midwesterners. Hislhusky
and strangely melodic
voice draws the audience
into his world and forces
them to. slow
down to his mea-

storytelling pace,
echoing the slow—«

where he grew

Since 1969, humorist and best—selling author
Garrison Keillor has delighted millions of public
radio listeners with his radio show'A Prairie‘

critically acclaimed works of fiction including
“Lake Wobegon Days” and his latest, “Love Me.”

Tonight he will open the 2003-2004 Druer

storytelling and humor

THE PITT NEWS I 13

Gonna make you sweat

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
Staff Writer

You’ve been working hard. The
drops of sweat are running off your
forehead and onto your damp shirt.
I?ve got the perfect accessory forpyou
— wristbands. They soak up the
sweat pouring off your- neck and
make a bold fashion statement all in
one. .
Boys, there’s finally an accessory
out there for you. Trust me, it’s hot.
But it isn’t exactly new. Making their
way back from the aerobic-crazed
‘80s, sweatbands are showing up
everywhere. But they aren’t just
sweatbands anymore. Wristbands are
the new fad, taking on a whole other
look. Who would have thought some-
thing that soaks up your sweat could
be fashionable? --

There is just something sex
about a guy in a wristband. Perhaps
it’s just seeing an accessory on a guy,
and knowing that he knows how to
coordinate an outfit. Or maybe it’s
because he looks like a man who isn’t
afraid to work.

Junior Steve McCloskey agrees,
“There is a complete lack of accept-
able male accessories. So when
something like wristbands comes
back, most guys will use it.”

Running late to class? Grab your

wristband and wipe off the sweat
forming on your brow. Procrastinated
and let your philosophy paper go
undone until the night before it’s
due? Stretch out your wristband and
get yourself on over to the computer
lab.

Girls are starting to walk around
‘campus with them, too —— in baby
blues, stripes and stars; it’s the
hottest accessory in the fashion world
right now.

The term wristband is rather mis-
leading. Forearm—band may be more
appropriate. Placing it right below
your elbow and strutting down
Forbes Ave. -should get you several
looks and perhaps several numbers.

Work the stripes or just a simple
white one with a decal. Try Puma or
Adidas.

Any unisex store in the mall that
has at least a small section devoted to
a few accessories should be selling
wristbands, too. Check . out
Gadzooks, Hot Topic, Hollister, or
www.urbanoutfitters.com. On their
Web site, not only will you find
wristbands, but you’ll also see some
cuffs — which are hot for guys —
that will only make you take about
$12 out of the bank. ,

And a little more than $10 is a
small priceito pay for style. Your

"wrists/forearms will thank you for it.

 



Elegantly furnished one or two bedroom apartment suites include an
equipped kitchen, ﬂuffy linens, TV, VCR, cable movies, free local phone service and

Pitt quarterback. Rod Rutherford is driven out of bounds  to reach the end zone during Saturday’s 37 -26 victory
over the Aggies of Texas A&M. Rutherford finished the game with 283 yards and a career-high ﬁve touchdowns.

Pittcomes upbig late in win

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

COLLEGE STATION, ‘Texas — This ‘

time, the Panthers’ defense put the nail in
the opposition’s coffin.

After being the scapegoat of last
week’s loss, in which Toledo drove 83
yards for its comeback victory, Pitt’s
defense was able to step up at the end of
the game and come up with a big play,
despite playing without its twohbest play-
ers on defense in the Panthers 37-26 vic-
tory over the Texas A&M Aggies on
Saturday.

“We are thrilled about winning this
game. This is a very challenging atmos-
phere, and we had a very difﬁcult loss to
deal with last week,” Walt Harris said. “A
lot of people jumped off the bandwagon
[and] didn’t believe in us.” - .

. The No. 17 ranked Panthers (3-1) lost
middle linebacker Lewis Moore to injury
during the second quarter and defensive
end Claude Haniott in the third quarter.
Still, the Panthers’ defensewas able to
come up with big plays-

 Pitt up 30-20 and less than nine
minutes to go in the game, weak-side

linebacker Malcolm Postell intercepted

\-P-'-5.1’-fééf"’*"
'\Vl-ALVA A!

Texas A&M (2-2) backup quarterback
Dustin Long in Panthers’ territory to halt
an Aggies’ drive.

“We always have faith in one anoth-
er,” linebacker Clint Session said. “This
game showed our heart — whether we
are willing to ﬁght.” ,

Pitt followed up Postell’s interception
with a touchdown, when wide receiver
Larry Fitzgerald reached back over his
shoulder and hauled in a 49-yard touch-
.down pass from quarterback Rod
Rutherford between three defenders. Witll
the Panthers leading 37-20, they only had
to play defense and 11111 out the clock.

Prior to the end of the ﬁrst quarter,
Pitt’s defense had turned in a stout perfor-
mance. On their second drive of the ﬁrst
quarter, the Aggies had the Panthers’
backs to the wall, with possession of the
ball on the Panthers’ eight-‘yard line.

Texas A&M faced fourth-and-one,
and quarterback Reggie McNeal fumbled
the snap, which Moore recovered for his

ﬁrst ~ of two fumble recoveries of the

game. -

The ﬁrst score of the game followed
up the fumble recovery. Pitt got on the
scoreboard when Fitzgerald jumped
between two defenders and came down

with a 34-yard strike from Rutherford a
little more than halfway through the first
quarter. Kicker David Abdul’s extra point
attempt hit the right upright, making the
score 6-0.

But Abdul redeemed himself with a
45-yard ﬁeld goal later in the ﬁrst quarter,
after Moore stripped punt returner Jason
Carter at Texas A&M’s 29-yard line for
his second fumble recovery of the game.

The second quarter belonged to the
Aggies, as they scored 13 unanswered
points. Texas A&M was able to take
advantage of its speedy backﬁeld by
using the option. McNeal and running
back Courtney Lewis combined for 90 of
its 119 rushing yards in the-ﬁrst half.

Texas A&M was held scoreless dur-
ing the ﬁrst quarter, but opened up the
second quarter with a 10-play, 80-yard
drive, Which ended with McNeal connect-
ing with wide receiver Jamaar Taylor for
an 18-yard touchdown, cutting Pitt’s lead
to 9-7.

The Aggies drove into Panthers’ terri-
tory on their next two drives, but were
held to two Todd Pegram ﬁeld goals,
which sent them into the locker room

A&M, page 17

 

A&M win
a big one
for Pitt

 

COLLEGE STATION, Texas —
The Texas A&M offense racked up
544 yards on the Panthers’ defense
on Saturday, including 303 yards in
the first half. »

The quarterback combination of
Reggie McNeal and Dustin Long
threw for 317 yards and Jamaar
Taylor hauled in six passes for 110
yards and a touchdown.

But thanks to four Aggie
turnovers, including two fumbles
on punt returns, Pitt was able to
sneak out of Texas with a win.

How about that for Southern
hospitality‘? 7

Five years from now, Pitt sup-
porters will look back and call this
a great win for head coach Walt
Harris and his program. To travel to
College Station, a week after a
shocking loss at Toledo, and win in
front of one of the loudest crowds
in the country, is an amazing feat. It
would be difficult to find another
group of 80,000 people who care
more about a football team than at
Texas A&M.

Even right now, this win looks
good for Pitt. Any road win against
a team from a powerful conference
is a good win. ‘

But there are still plenty of
holes the Panthers need to find a
way to plug, and on the top of that
list is their sieve-like passing
defense.

Texas A&M head coach Dennis
Franchione took" a page out of
Toledo’s playbook, having McNeal
dump the ball off with short, quick
passes to his receivers and backs.
And when they weren’t throwing,
McNeal was running the option to

Cleveland State comes from behind for soccer win

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Pitt sports teams are finding lately that no
lead is safe in the state of Ohio.

The Cleveland State men’s soccer team won
3-2 in comeback fashion against Pitt, battling
back from a 2-1 deficit with ten _minutes left in
the game and scoring twice to steal a win away
from the Panthers. '

Stephen Ademolu led the way for the Vikings
of Cleveland State (6-3) by scoring two goals,
including the game winner, with less than three
minutes left on the clock. For Ademolu, his two
goals against Pitt (2-6 overall, 1-2 Big East)
placed him on top of all Division 1 goal scorers,
with 10 goals. -

Panthers defender Clay Haﬂich scored early
in the game to put Pitt up 1-0. The goal came at
17:50 when Haﬂich redirected the ball with his
head into the net, off of a penalty kick from
Brian Madden.

Cleveland State struck back and tied the
game when Ademolu scored his first goal of the

game. Ademolu took a pass from David
Carmichael and streaked in on net. He then got
past Panthers’ goalkeeper Justin Lowery in a‘
one—on-one battle’ andshot the ball in on the
open net at 36:29.

The Panthers broke the tie" just before the
half with a goal from sophomore Keeyan Young.
Young kicked a loose ball sitting in the box into
the net at 43:01 to put Pitt up 2-1 going into the,
second half. < ‘

The Panthers had a chance in the second half
to take a two-goal lead, but missed on a penalty
kick. ' '

“Could have sealed [the game],” head coach
Joe Luxbacher said after the game.

The Panthers entered the final 10 minutes of _

the game still holding on to the 2-1 lead, but the
Vikings turned on the offense.

Ademolu sent a low kick into the scoring
box. The ball bounced around and settled down
for Viking midfielder David Stewart, who wast-
ed. no time kicking the ball to the back of the net
at 80:10. -

The Vikings offense did not stop there.

Spencer Lappin took the ball at midfield and
worked it all the way down field, maneuvering

past two Pitt defenders. Lappin crossed the ball ’

to the middle, getting it to Ademolu, who faked
out Lowery and scored the game winner at
87:06. _ .

The Panthers were outplayed offensively in
the second half, being out-shot l4-4. Cleveland
St_ate’s Ademolu was too much for the Panthers’
defense to handle. , ‘ i

The Panthers’ defense has been in question
as of late. Pitt has allowed 49 shots in its last
three losses, including the 19 shots allowed to
Cleveland State. Pitt has been outscored ,9-5 in
those three losses. 6 A

The loss was made more difficult by the fact
the Panthers allowed a late-game lead to slip
away. . '

“When you’re ahead with 10 minutes left,

youhave to hold. onto the lead,” Luxbacher said.

A bright side for the Panthers is that the
offense showed some life, scoring two goals in

the first half. Young and Haflich each notched

their second goal of the season.

Pitt Wide/1 receiver Larry Fitzgerald pulls in the first of his three touchdown ,
receptions of the day. Fitzgerald caught seven passes for a total of 135 yards.

Backup J awan Walker key

A&M, page 15

with a 13-9 lead at halftime.

Texas A&M amassed 544 total yards
of offense, with 227 coming on the
ground and 317 through the air.

“We gave up some yards [and] our
defense held them to ﬁeld goals, [but] it
could have gotten out of hand earlier and
made it a lot harder [on us].” Harris said.

Pitt had possession first in the second
half and switched the momentum back to
its side. On third and 20, Rutherford
found wide receiver Princell
Brockenbrough in the comer of the end
zone. Brockenbrough made a diving
catch and managed to drag his feet in
bounds for the touchdown. The Panthers
were ahead 16-13 two minutes, 49 sec-
onds into the second half, and never
trailed again. I

‘Through all of the adversity, all of

* the noise, all of the momentum and a

bunch of good football players over there '

at Texas A&M, we found a way to come
back in the second half and win.” Harris
said.

The Panthers’ defense was not the
only side of the ball that was banged—u‘p.
Jon Schall had to make his second con-
secutive 1 start at center, and John
Sirnonitis beganthe game at right guard;
neither Justin Belarski nor Rob Frederick

were able to play. Most notably, starting
running back Brandon Miree did not play
because of a leg injury he suffered against
Toledo.

Jawan Walker stepped in at running
back and struggled early as the “Aggies’
defense held Walker to 15 yards rushing
in the first half. But the second half was a
different story.

Walker came out on ﬁre in the second
half, accumulating 72 yards rushing in the
half, and ﬁnished the game with 87 yards
rushing on 20 carries.

“We ended up running the ball for
195 yards, which is tremendous with a
back-up running back in Jawan Walker.”
Harris said.

Fullback Lousaka Polite rushed for
38 yards on nine carries, Rutherford
rushed for 37 yards on 11 carries, and
wide receiver Terrell Allen rushed for 34
yards on two end-arounds, giving the
Panthers 195 yards rushing.

Rutherfordﬁnished with 14 comple-
tions on 28 attempts for 283 yards and a
career-high ﬁve touchdowns. Fitzgerald
caught seven passes for 135 yards and
three touchdowns. He has now caughta
touchdown pass in 10 games in a row.

The Panthers have a bye this week-
end and will be back in action on Oct. 11
when the Notre Dame Fighting Irish
come to Heinz Field.

Pitt’sadj.ustments the difference in victory over Aggies‘

Marchilena, p_ag.e___15 ,  J,  ~

perfection. As 5‘ team, the Aggies’

averaged seven yards per"p‘1ay from
scrimmage.

But unlike in the game against
Toledo, Pitt made adjustments at
halftime. Both cornerbacks played
closer to the line of scrimmage, and
both outside linebackers found their
way into McNeal’s passing lanes,
forcing the Aggies to look else-
where.

-Also unlike in the game against
Toledo, the Panthers defense was
able to get off the field on third
down, forcing the Aggies to either

pu,r1t,_-or latitempti a field goalieoln
seven, of 13, drives. Three of those
drives‘ lasted seven plays‘ or ‘more,

. an‘d3h5d the Agg~iés found a way into-

the end zone on any of them, Pitt
would not have been able to recov-
er.

The players know they need to
improve on defense as well.

“The defense has got a lot of
work to do,” freshman linebacker
Clint Session said. “I think we have
to be a little more aggressive and
play harder. We had a lot of missed
tackles; we definitely need to work
on that even more.”

In its defense, Pitt played most

of the game without starting middle
linebacker Lewis Moore. Defensive
ends Claude Harriott and Thomas
Smith also missed part of the game
with injuries.

But the players can’t use those
injuries as an excuse and it doesn’t
seem like they will.

“We [redeemed ourselves]
somewhat, but if you look at the
stats, we’re still not pleased with
what we did, even though we won,”
free safety Tez Morris said. “We
gave up some points and some
yardage, and they were able to run
the ball, so we’re still not pleased.”

pleased with their defensive perfor-
mance, but because the offense has

so many weapons —-— see here:
Heisman candidates Rod Rutherford
and Larry Fitzgerald —— Pitt can

keep up with any opponent.

Come home games against the
defenses of Virginia Tech and
Miami, it’s going to be a lot harder
for the Panthers to rack up 35—plus
points every week. And with Pitt
done with a third of its schedule
already, which means the defense
needs to get better —— and soon.
