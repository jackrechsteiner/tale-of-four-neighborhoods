Many students’
lifestyles too A
busy forpets  

ROB GEBHART
Staff Writer

As the semester progresses, many students long for the
comforts of home: parents, brothers and sisters, old friends
and the family dog.

Most of these are irreplaceable; it’s difﬁcult to ﬁnd suit-
able substitutes for mom and pop, but as for Fido 

Every year college students who are looking for some
animal companionship rush out to adopt a puppy or kitten.

That is a trend dangerous to the animal, said Alyce
McKean, a 10-year volunteer cat catcher with Animal
Friends, one of Pittsburgh’s three animal shelters and the

only no-kill shelter in the city.

McKean said many students simply abandon their pets
at the end of the school term. Often, frugal students neglect
to spay or neuter their pet so that if the animal is left to run
wild, it also reproduces wildly. ,

? Every spring McKean ends up in Oakland with her
humane trap trying to catch these strays before they repro-
duce or spread feline leukemia, a cancer indigenous to cats.

, The trap is a cage baited with tuna or sardines. When the cat

takes the bait, the door snaps shut and the feline is trapped
inside. Generally, McKean ﬁnds colonies of eight to 10 cats
roaming the Oakland area. Since there are many food
sources around college campuses, the animals thrive and
reproduce.

When McKean traps them, she takes them to the shelter
where they _are spayed or neutered, given a rabies shot, test-
ed for feline leukemia and ear-tipped to show they are safe.
Kittens are rehabilitated‘afndc'cats ‘are re-released".

“Youare -too unsettled at 119 to take on the responsibili-
ty of a pet,” McKean said, and cited a variety of reasons.

‘Landlords bust some students and,.unable to ﬁnd a new
home for their pets, the students must turn them loose.

Often, at the end of the year, students cannot take the
animals home and are again forced to release their pet.

She added _that_ most students do not have .the time to
dedicate to car,in‘g. for“'a pet. For_ these reasons, Animals
Friends refuses to allow college students to adopt pets.

Tim Crum, spokesmen for the Animal ‘Rescue League,
agreed with McKean’s reasons against student pet owner-
ship, but said his shelter is still willing to adopt out to stu-
dents provided they meet requirements; , I -

Anyone adopting from Animal Rescue League must
have permission from their landlord to own a pet, must be at
least 18 years of age -and must pass an interview with an
adoption counselor. Adoption counselors pass ‘or fail appli-
cants-based on their own‘ judgment. . . 1

“We aren’t against college students,” Crum stressed. But
the lifestyle many students lead isn’t conducive to pet own-

CAS creates more
openings in classes  

ERIC LIDJI ,
SENIOR STAFF WRITER

Space.

That abstract entity is always in
short supply. Be it parking space or
living space, it is rare that there is
everjan abundance.

But Barbara Mellix, the_ assis-
tant dean and director of the
College of Arts and Sciences advis-
ing center and a team of about eight
advisers have been working for

.more than a year on a process to

create classroom space for students.
As a result, some of the more
popular required and introductory
courses have lots of empty seats
waiting to be filled.
“We did take note when stu-

I dents complained about not having

seats in courses,” Mellix said.

The idea originated last year at
the beginning of the fall term, “sit-
ting around the table for hours upon
hours projecting what we will
need,” Mellix said.

At that time, the initiative’s
goal was only to free up classes for
freshmen. But success has broad-
ened the project to include return-
ing students who wish to take intro-
ductory or general education class-
es as well.

These classes are only available
until Sept. 7, the end of Pitt’s
add/drop period.

The courses that are open right

a A t3’.?‘$§§y .I'.9.....?... ' x- ...

now are in the popular communica-
tion, psychology and sociology
departments. The advising center
only presides over introductory and
general education classes — those

big classes that can have as many as .-

400 students enrolled. ._

The process by which the
department opened some. of the
classes involved looking at course
registration and trying to project
which courses students will be tak-
ing and how many willbe taking
them.

There are many other factors.

-involved in the process, including

the fact that students in other col-
leges, such as the School of
Engineering or the business school,
sometimes cross over and take
courses like algebra or chemistry.

Also, in a field such as educa-
tional planning, Mellix said, there
never is, and never will be, a set
system of understanding which
courses will prove more popular
than others.

Over long periods of time, dif-

ferent paths of study and different .

courses become more popular.
Trends form and Mellix and the
team she works with always have to
adjust. « *

“It’s tricky,” Mellix said.

“You’re never going to be able to
give every student every course
they need and want, but we are
working very» hard.”

Most fakes don’t cut it

Fakes, page 1

Sometimes the difference
between real and fake can be subtle.

“New York IDs make this swish
noise when you run your finger over
it,” Damon said. “For some reason,
the fake ones don’t.”

A simple signature and photo
check can help a clerk to spot an ID
that is real but does not belong to
the purchaser.

To aid in their checking, the
University Beverage Center uses a
guide published by the
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board
that provides" photographs and
descriptions of the proper identifi-
cation for all 50 states. The guide is
updated yearly. .

In compliance with the Liquor
Control Board, the ' University
Beverage Center requires anyone
under the age of 30 to sign a decla-
ration of age card, stating that the

purchaser is over the age of 21 and _

recognizes the possible penalties for
presenting false identification.

At state liquor, stores, clerks
check IDs through a computerized
system built into the cash registers.
When a clerk swipes the magnetic
strip of a customer’s ID, that per-
son’s name, address and other iden-
tifying information such as height
and weight pop up in the computer
and print out on a receipt.

The customer is then required to
sign the receipt, acknowledging that

"he or she is that person, and the

clerk has the opportunity to verify

the information.

The Pennsylvania Liquor
Control Board requires stores to”
swipe the_ID of anyone who appears
to be under the age of 30.

IDs from Pennsylvania as well
as several other states, including
Ohio and West Virginia, are
scannable. State liquor stores use
the Liquor Control Board’s guide to__
verify IDs from states that do not
yet comply with the computerized
system. »

Most bars and clubs do not have
such high—tech systems.

At Peter’s Pub in Oakland, a
bouncer checks IDs at the door after
9 p.m. During the day, the responsi-
bility falls to bartenders and the
wait staff.

"Peter’s

Pub Manager Paul

-Vukmir said that the first thing that

bouncers examine when checking
IDs is the photograph, ‘followed by
eye color and height .

“People change so much that
you really can’t go on the picture
alone,”_ he said. ,

Vukmir said that most underage
people opt to use the real ID of an
older friend. ”“

When bouncers at Peters suspect
this, they request backup iden"tifica‘-
tion, and may ask the person to sign
a declaration of ‘age form.

Vukmir said i that Peter’s turns
people away because of false identi-
fication on a nightly basis. Even so,
he added, “You can’t catch all the
fake IDs.” . 7

“There’s just no way,” he said.

Fun 101; Finding classes to

DARLENE MONLISH
The Pitt News

Pitt students should not despair if
classes in subjects such as advanced
modern statistical computing have
them in a tizzy. There’s still a suffi-

cient amount of time to drop those »
‘ classes and add a course that’s sure '

to bring some fun to the fall semes-
ter. c s A
For those students searching for
a class—that will provide an escape
from the rut -of brain—numbing cours-
es are in luck. The following is an
abbreviated list of classes that are
not only student-approved, but that
will also broaden horizons. ‘

The College of Arts and
Sciences’ theater department pro-
vides students with the opportunity
to increase their theatrical skills in
its introduction to performance
course. According to the course
selection -guide, the class, which is

worth three credits, will help stu-

dents “develop through ‘improvisa-

tion and simple scene study, sensory

awareness, ‘emotional awareness,
vocal and physical expressiveness

*' and the ability to play given circum-
V stances.” '

‘ Doug Mertz, an introduction to

' “performance professor, hopes that

his students will “develop an appre-

. ciation for theatre and become more

comfortable expressing themselves
in front of an audience.”

Those in search of rest and relax-
ation should look to the physical
yoga I
course. The guide says that the one-

credit class will help students devel-I‘
op a stronger mind-body connection
and to ease ‘the tension of college

life.

Jiujitsu is another one-credit
course offered through the physical
education department. For those not
familiar with this method of defense",
jiujitsu involves no. weapons, but
rather, techniques. using hands, feet
and hips as a form of defense.

Interested in learning about what
makes good people go bad? If so, the
College of General Studies’ adminis-
tration of justice department has just
the class. Terrorism is a three-credit
course that studies the reasons for the
spread and development of terrorism
throughout the world.

For the musically inclined, histo-
ry of jazz -takes students on a journey
through time as they study jazz from

its early origins in the 1800s to the

present. The class, worth three cred-
its, covers blues, spirituals, ragtime

soothe the stressed student

and gospel, among other genres. Dr.
Nathan Davis, a history of jazz pro-
fessor, said his ultimate goal is to
“pass on the true history of jazz.”

Ever wonder about Pittsburgh’s
origins? In the history of Pittsburgh
course, students will not only exam-
ine the beginnings of Pennsylvania’s
second-largest city, but also learn
about how Pittsburgh’s past has
shaped the city today. «

Dr. Edward Muller, one of the
course’s professors, said that he
hopes Pittsburgh natives “gain a bet-
ter understanding of the city, its cul-
ture, values and landscape.”

For other students who do not
plan to make Pittsburgh a permanent
home, Muller said he hopes they
“gain an in—depth understanding of
how American cities have developed
and how they work.”

Also offered through the history
department, U.S. popular culture is a
three-credit class that enables stu-‘
dents to “understand how Americans
adapted to a rapidly changing and

increasingly uncertain world,”
according to the course description
guide. ‘

This course aims to help students
grasp an understanding ofhow the
United States became the country it
is today by focusing on events that
occurred from the Depression era up
to the present. ’

Childhood’s books is a course
designed to teach students the origins
of children’s literature and enable
them to understand its purpose and
history. In this three-credit class, stu-
dents are given the chance to read
novels, picture books and poetry
designed specifically for children.

Finally, Russian fairy tales
depicts Russian traditions and cus-
toms through stories. The class uses
a variety of resources such as.
posters, illustrations and slides to
increase students’ understanding of
this genre. ‘ '

So if students find themselves
sweating out a class that has them
wondering what they were thinking
when they concocted their fall sched-
ules, they should consider dropping
the problematic course before that
molehill becomes a mountain.
Although some of the more popular
courses on campus may already be
closed for the semester, students can
keep checking for openings.

The add/drop deadline is Sept. 7,
so if new strategies in heterocyclic
chemistry isn’t working out, there’s
still time to consideradding a little
fun to the fall.

Bronze panther arrives at William Pitt Union

A. crane lifted the newest addition to Pitt’s landscape — a bronze panther purchased
by Student Government Board for $72,000 — into place yesterday morning.

Some   students can’t
handle pet pressures

Pets, page 1

ership, he said.

Crum said he adopted his first dog
his during his junior year at Pitt, _but he
lived at home, and his brothers and par-
ents helped him care for the pet.

Because Animal Rescue League is
an open shelter, anyone who carmot
take care of his or her pet can take it
there and it will be accepted without
any questions.

Student year Samantha Schwartz

- recently adopted an 8-month-old white

pit bull named Juliet. She admits that
most students aren’t . responsible
enough to own a pet, but considers her-
self a unique exception because she is a
part-time student and has extra time to
care for Juliet.

- “Most of the summer was dedicat-
ed to the dog,” she said. “You have to
be sostable; it’s like having a child.”

Schwartz pointed out that difficul-
ties arise when two roommates adopt
together and later have to decide who
will take the animal when they move
aPa1't-. ‘

All too many students opt for the
solution of kicking their kitten out the
door, McKean said.

“My ultimate message is: Don’t
adopt,” McKean said. “If you adopt,
don’t abandon. If you are going to be a
responsible ‘pet owner get your pet
spayed or neutered.”

McKean suggested that students .
who wantto spend time with animals

volunteer at Animal Friends by calling
412-566-2103 ext. 225.

Ace the

Panther

spirit pop quiz

It’s time for your first pop quiz
of the year, and your existence as a
Pitt fan depends upon it.

True or false: You are going to
the first football game of the season
on Saturday with a horde of friends,
decked out from head to toe in Pitt
gean

That’s what we thought. The cor-
rect answer is, of course, true. And
for extra credit, you will spend some
time before the game scouring cam-_
pus in search of more Pitt parapher-
nalia. '

Remember, there is no such
thing as too much Pitt pride —
gaudy signs, blue-and-gold painted
faces and football-shaped Mardi
Gras beads are encouraged.

So here’s your game plan.
Kickoff isn’t until 6 p.m., so that
leaves plenty of time for pre-game
partying and tailgating.

Plan to spend the afternoon fos-
tering a festive spirit and taking part
in long-lived traditions, like the
Panther Prowl and FanFest.

You might even decide to finally
learn the real words to the Pitt fight
song.

Student parking is free, so
there’s no reason not to head out ear-

lier.

No car? Don’t want to drive to
the game? No problem. Pitt will also
run free shuttles to and from
Oakland. We especially encourage
those 21-and-over folks who are
planning to partake of mood-
enhancing beverages to take the
shuttles. _

When you head into the brand
new Heinz Field, marvel at the state-
of-the-art stadium and huge score-
board, which can expand to a display
size of 96 feet by 27 feet.

Take your seat and get pumped
to watch the best college team in the
state. Poised for exciting season,
coming from a bowl appearance last
year, the Panthers are. currently
ranked 31st in Division I and could
crack the top 25 this season.

Just visualize how sweet it will
be to see the Panthers’ winning score
flashing on that blue whale—sized
score board after they pounce on the
East Tennessee State Buccaneers. g

Chant, cheerand go wild during
the game. .

Remember, it’s your team, your

‘ school and your spirit. Be the 12th

man and root the Panthers on to the
first of many victories.

if Mandy ever saw me drinking or
smoking at a party, she was sup-
posed to snatch the source of
immorality out of my hand and
promptly punch me in the face, and
vice versa.

The idea was that when I recov-
ered from the punch and came to
my right mind, I would surely
be grateful that Mandy had
saved me from a life of
scandal and squalor.

The I punch
pledge is now null
and void. But I
played field hock-
ey‘ with Mandy,
and I know she is
strong. So in the
pit of my heart, I
still fear her right
hook, and that is
motivation enough to
abstain from smoking.

10. I like knowing that
there’s still a total mystery for me
out there, something I have never
tried or experienced. The knowl-
edge of that mystery makes every
day a little more exciting and helps
me to maintain a small sense of
wonder.

is as follows: Continue to wear an

Hedwig’s androgyny key to understanding film

1-ledwig and the Angry Inch”
Written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell
rfnihkt/2_ r

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

In some unnamed hotel room on the Kansas
City leg of the Hedwig world tour, we see a bed-
room ﬁlled with wigs. They are on shelves, on the
bed, on the ﬂoor, and all expressing different
images and looks.

On the bed in the middle of
the deluge of fake hair sits
Yrtzhak, a scruffy, stubble-faced,
bandana-wearing male rocker
played by Miriam Shor, a
woman. As he sits brushing a wig, he furtively
looks around and slips it on his head. He seems
happy until suddenly he hears his hermaphrodite
wife, Hedwig. Hedwig is played by John Cameron
Mitchell. To avoid being caught in drag by his
androgynous wife, Yrtzhak rips the wig off just as
Hedwig enters the room.

This concept of complete disregard
and utter obliviousness to the divi-

Watch

sions between man and woman is the very core
and catalyst for every theme, metaphor and analo-
gy that appear throughout “Hedwig and the Angry
Inch.” ’

The story takes place on Hedwig’s tour as she
follows big—time rocker Tommy Gnosis around the
country. Through her monologues at each perfor-
mance, we learn Hedwig’s story.

Born in Berlin as Hansel, the pro-
tagonist is trapped during the divid-
ing of the city. ‘One day while sun-
ning nude in a dump yard, he meets
an American soldier named Luther
who, after a short mistaken gender identity inci-
dent, falls in love and wants to marry him. But this
is a city in the middle of a cold war, and the only
way they can get hitched is if Hansel unhitches
what he’s got. In other words, he must become a

woman.

But the operation goes

Airstream brings books,

slice of life, Canadians

While sitting in the silverAirstrearn’s
homey interior, ﬂipping through a deli-
cate hand-bound book entitled “Borises
bythe Sea,”Iamtransportedbacktoa
time when I made small, fabric-covered
hand-bound books. They weren’t truly
artistic or anything like an intellectual
zine, but as I ﬂip through each book, the

    

author/artist in me can relate to the 
authors/artrststhathave designed these lrt- '
‘13b°°k5- ‘ Leslie Hoffman

This Airstream belongs to Projet
Mobilivre-Bookmobile Project, a Canadian—American joint effort to
expose communities to a collection of artistic books and zines from
across the country. For the last several days, the Airstream and its
overseers have sojourned in front of Hunt Library on Carnegie
Mellon University’s campus.

In ﬁont of the trailer sits Aya Kanai, 23, a graduate ofOberlin
College. She explains to me that the books in the Bookmobile are
there because of a contest supported by the project More than 500
people from the United States, Canada and ﬂre United Kingdom
entered, and a Montreal jury of ﬁve chose which books would go on
tour. About 100 books or so sit within the trailer.

Kanai, who is from New York, traveled to Philadelphia to join
the tour for two weeks. She travels with two other women, both
founders of the project. They live not out of the Airstream, but out of
the van that pulls the trailer.

Kanai emphasizes that they receive no grants, and therefore live
a sort of hand-to-mouth existence. For‘ example, the van is currently
experiencing engine trouble, and Kanai expresses concern about it

‘Thispieceof... shit,”she says. “Imean, weliveinthisvan 
I love this van, but it’s not going to get us over the Rockies.”

The tour began in Montreal in July and will travel in a big loop
around the country to the West Coast and back through Canadauntil
the middle of November, when it will end in Toronto. -

Despite the lack of funding and their current technical problems,
Kanai seems veryhappytobeapartofthisproject.

“It has been a massive success,” she says. “People seem really
excited about seeing [the books] .” C

“A lot of heart goes into making them,” she adds. A

KanaitellsmethattheycametoCMUbecauseoneoftheartists

. featured in the exhibit, Fereshteh‘ Toosi, is studying for her masters

of ﬁne arts degree there, and that she arranged for them to stay at the
university. .

Toosi’s book, perhaps appropriate for a technology-savvy..CMU
student, consists of brightly colored ﬂoppy disks bound together
by apiece of thread Each disk quotes a different statistic about
the type of people who are not yet online.

IaskKanaiifshehas abookinthevan, and she squinches
up her face, but reluctantly tells me yes.

I examine her book, which is not a book in the common
sense. It is instead a hinged box that opens to wooden, paint-
edpagesthatcanbeliftedﬁomtheboxtoberead

While sitting in the Airstream, I also examine the other

books. They’re very beautiful. It is true, what Kanai tells me,
that these books are like a “little window into someone else’s
soul.”

While the Bookmobile’s stay here in Pittsburgh is brief, Kanai
hinted that they might try to venture toward Pitt today. Stop by if you
see them; you just might get to peek into someone else’s soul.

“Hedwig and the Angry lnch” soundtrack

Hybrid Recordings
Songs written by Stephen Trask

Performed by John Cameron Mitchell

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

The kings of musicals -— those
Berlins, Lloyd Webbers and
Sondheims, the living and dead mas-
ters who reigned until the late 1960s
on the silver screen and have been
granted immortality on Broadway by
the audiences of the

world — should be
electrified.

Those hallowed
individuals of song

and dance should be dancing in their
studios and stages, or if they are
dead, rocking and rolling in their
graves, because John Cameron
Mitchell and Stephen Trask have
created a musical that could revital-
ize the concept and re-examine just
What the medium can accomplish.

And of course, the music is the
central element.

All of the highly satirized motifs
of the old Hollywood musical have
been removed or changed. The cast
never bursts into song and skedad—
dles in tap shoes down main street;
all the songs are in concert. The
lyrics are not catchy, they are solid
and good.

Yes, “Hedwig” is different.

These songs collectively stand
alone as a work of music, just like
any other album. But the lyrics tell a
story, and that story is carefully
planned to mimic the screenplay.
Whereas the standard musical was a
play with songs, in “Hedwig” the
songs add to the plot, they explain
the characters and the action, and
they dictate tone and emotion.

The songs change
as Hedwig
d o e s .

S o m e

lyrics are mad, while others become.

cynical. Some are sweet and others
are shocking. But regardless, they
are all laced with the glitz, glam and
Technicolor of punk rock that all at
once disgusts and delights — they
are both shocking and acceptable.

And just like the sexuality of the
character Hedwig, the songs are con-
tradicting. They have
the intensity and non-
chalance of rock along
with the pain and soul-
searching words of a
character in distress. The music and
the lyrics both ﬂow and contradict
— the whole experience is a paradox
and confusing in a provocative way,
and that makes it just right.

Whether it’s “Tear Me Down,”
the first song that introduces the
Hedwig situation by comparing her
to the Berlin wall, erected on the day
of her birth. Just as the wall was a
symbol of division that was torn
down, Hedwig is an area between
man and woman. A

Or “Wig In a Box,” about how
the different looks of each wig create
an attitude withinthe wearer. This
song is the catalyst for Hedwig’s
transformation from a genderless,
divorced housewife to a rock star
with a cult underground following.

Or “Origin of Love,” a look at
love from a standpoint of mythology.

Orthe intense love and desire of
“Midnight Radio” and the piano bal-
lad “Wicked Little Town,” recorded
in two versions on the album, and
close to tops on the album.

This is one of those rare enter-
tainment entities that, despite how
successful or remembered it is, will

definitely demand that the powers
that be in the musical world
rethink their methods.
I And that is a feat.

Since the 1980s, cities with high levels_
of pollution have embraced the oxygen bar
trend. From Las Vegas to Toronto to Tokyo
and San Francisco, these bars oﬁer their
clients short sittings in chic settings where
they can breathe pure oxygen. j

While the polluted Pittsburgh of the
past could possibly have proﬁted from
such late 20th century conventions, art
ﬁends looking for a ﬁgurative breath of
fresh air can ﬁnd three invigorating exhibi-
tions at the current Regina Gouger Miller
Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University.

“Aether,” which occupies the third-
ﬂoor exhibit space, features the work of
ﬁve artists: Paul Villinski, Paul Stremple,.
Shari Mendelson, Linn Meyers and Pitt’s
own Delanie Jenkins.

Whether it’s Mende1son’s bronze and
enamel sculptures that resemble pastel
doodles from an engineer’s notebook, or
Jenkins’ subtly glittering wall sculpture

composed of joint compound and threads
of monoﬁlarnent weighted by small lead
balls, each of the pieces in this ethereal
exhibit make the. most of both air and
space. i - ~
V1l1inski’s imagination takes us on -
excuse the term —— ﬂights of fancy. His
piece, “Spinner,” consists
of a gasoline engine
attached to a helmet. The
engine powers a smooth
wooden propeller on the
top of the helmet, and is ostensibly con-
trolled by a bike’s handbrake.

Villinski has also fashioned “Lament”
— perhaps a tribute to Icarus —— by sewing
knit gloves into the shape of wings
attached to a body hamess, while a balsa
wood sketch model for “Dreamer” could
carry someone off to sleep on its little bed.

“Aether” may exude a heavenly aura,
but one ﬂoor below, “Perspective,” by Paul
Warne, exudes a netherwordly one.

“Vocabulary” by Dale McNutt appro-
priately explores themes gathered from
childhood imagery.

The 121 pieces of paper are home to
vibrant, colorful and playful paint in bright
yellow, magenta, fuchsia, teal as well as
earthy tones. Objects both natural and syn-
thetic ﬁnd themselves on the papers in- the
way of a haphazard collage.

But “Vocabulary”, does not recognize

the word haphazard. Each of these cre-
ations may seem childlike, but McNutt’s
placing of polished stones and shells, bark,
wire, rusted tailpipes, and plastic cups is
not.

One of the pieces, “Saltwater Pond,”
features clear blue broken glass, a shell, a
beige piece of brick bark and sun yellow
paint.

“Mother Form” features paint and
objects in the shape of a woman.

For the McNutt, “Vocabulary” repre-
sents a new beginning. But all three of the
exhibits housed at the gallery present fresh
looks for Pittsburglfs art lovers.

Hedwig rocks

Hedwig, page 10

terribly wrong and Hansel, now
Hedwig, is left a hermaphrodite with
only a lump of ﬂesh between her legs,
which she cynically nicknames “the
angry inch.”

Once the newlyweds arrive in the
states, though, Luther leaves. Hedwig,
now dejected, decides to become what
she has dreamed of being from child-
hood, a rock star. Along theway she
meets Tommy, and, taking him under
her wing, the two of them start a group.
But when Tommy ﬁnds out Hedwig’s
secret during an embarrassing romantic

encounter, he leaves and starts his own
act, using all of Hedwig’s songs — thus
Hedwig’s story and her plight.

Because that mixture is what
“Hedwig” is, it’s about the mixture of
man and woman. _It’s a series of
metaphors and allegories that not only
accentuate the story, but also are the
story. It is a very complex tale in which
no one part can be removed, because it
is at its simplest form. ,

And so the title is perfect because
Hedwig and her angry inch are the sub-
ject of the ﬁlm, as well as an explana-
tion of it — everything in this world
comes full circle.

Panthers open new home vs. East Tennessee State

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

The countdown to the kickoff of
the 2001 football season at the new
Heinz‘ Field is quickly winding
down, and tomorrow at 6 p.m., the
Panthers begin their crusade toward
another winning season. I

The first roadblock of the season
comes in the form of I—AA foe East
Tennessee State; the meeting will be
the first ever between the two uni-
versities-

East Tennessee State, which
hails from the Southern Conference,
will have_its work cut out for itself
on Saturday as the team is much
smaller than the Panthers on both
sides of the ball.

The Panthers’ offense this year
will be little different because this
season offensive coordinator J.D.
Brookhart is going to a spread
offense, which spreads opposing
defenses out with wide routes for
receivers and wide sets. .

With a deep receiving corps that
includes "Heisman hopeful Antonio
Bryant, R.J. English and Lamar
Slade, the Panthers will widen the

weight advantage over the
Buccaneers’ left defensive tackle
Travis Williams. 

The size gap is similar across the
line — Pitt center Chad Reed out-
weighs Buccaneers nose guard Bill
Fells by 30 pounds. The size advan-
tage on‘ the line should open holes
for Panthers running back Ray
Kirkley.

Kirkley, a true freshman, was
named the starting running back last
week. The young tailback is a strong
runner, with a compact 5-foot-l0-
inch, 220 pound frame that’s made
for dragging runners as he did dur-
ing summer Scrimmages.

Backing up Kirkley is redshirt
freshman Malcolm Postell and true
freshman Mike Jemison. Both
should receive playing time.

Starting at quarterback for the
Buccaneers is Matt Wilhjelm.
Wilhjelm is undersized at 5—foot-10
and 170 pounds, but he does have
experience since he’s going into his
senior campaign. ’

The men going after Wilhjelm
for the Panthers are defensive ends

announced Wednesday night that
quarterback David Priestley would
start. But Harris did say that backup

Need directions to the game?

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Whether you’re leaving for tomorrow’s foot-
ball opener at noon to get an early start on tail-
gating or you’re leaving shortly before the 6 p.m.
start, there are plenty of ways to get down to
Heinz Field. S

The easiest way to get tothe game is to take
advantage of Pitt’s free bus transportation. Buses
will depart from Bigelow Boulevard throughout
the day to transport students to the Roberto
Clemente Bridge. .

The bridge is closed off for festivities, so
anyone going to the game can simply walk across
it.

If you are driving, get on Bates Street. For
those of you who don’t know where Bates is,
drive down South Bouquet Street, Atwood Street
or McKee Place and you’ll run into Bates. If you

1 don’t know where those streetsare, you’d better

take the bus. ,

Once you get onto Bates, go straight and take
a right onto the Boulevard of the Allies. Follow
signs for Route 376 West to Downtown. Take the
North Shore exit and follow signs to Heinz Field.
If you see a big yellow-seated stadium, you’re
there.

If you do not want to drive and you tend to
like the PAT buses more than the Panther shuttles,
you can catch the 96D to the Strip District or the
96X to Mellon Arena. -Panther shuttles will be
waiting at each location.

You cannot park in the Heinz Field parking
lot because all of the spaces there are reserved.
Student parking will be located behind PN C Park.
You can reach the lot via Federal Street or
Sandusky Street. Both are off of General
Robinson Street. .

Once you hit Federal or Sandusky, turn onto
Lacock Street and you’ve arrived.

Goldman’srecipe for the Heisman Trophy’s return to Pitt

Only three times in the history
of the Heisinan Trophy award has a
wide receiver taken the highest
honor. On top of that, six of the last
nine Heisman Trophies ~
were given to quarter-
backs, and two more given
to running backs.

Pitt is still a few years
away from being “it”
again, but redshirt junior
wide receiver Antonio
Bryant is beyond “it.”
Last season Bryant won
the Biletnikoff Award for
being the nation’s best
wide receiver, and now he
is considered a Heisman

  

spans Vlnw

Brian Goldman

since a wide receiver , Michigan’s
Desmond Howard, won the
Heisman.

I’m still not done with numbers.

‘ _When Howard won his
Heisman 10 years ago,
he did it with one year
of eligibility left.
Bryant also has one year
of eligibility remaining
after this season. It’s
quite a coincidence.

If these types of
numbers determined the
Heisman, Antonio might
be the front-runner to
win the trophy. But
since these numbers

 

Trophy candidate.

But I pose this question: Can a
wide receiver even win the Heisman
Trophy? And what does Bryant have
to do this season to win the nation’s
highest college football honor?

Before I get into how Bryant can
win the trophy, 1et’s play a little
numbers game.

Since Bryant is a Panther, we
will start with the only Panther ever
to win the award: Tony Dorsett.
Dorsett won the trophy 25 years
ago. It has been exactly 10 years

aren’t used in Heisman voting, what
does Bryant have to do to bring the
Heisman Trophy back to
Pittsburgh?

Let’s look at the. competitors.
There are three quarterbacks in the
mix this year vying for the Heisman
Trophy. Senior quarterback Eric
Crouch of Nebraska is looking to
take his team to a national champi-
onship this year. Bryant will need
Nebraska as a whole to falter this
year and loose to some teams they
aren’t supposed to lose to and push

Crouch out of the running no matter
what type of numbers he puts up.
Miami’s junior quarterback Ken
Dorsey and Oregon’s senior quar-
terback Joey Harrington sit in the
same boat as Crouch, but Bryant has
the distinct honor of‘ going up
against Miami this year, and that
game will be big, not just for Pitt,

.but for Bryant’s Heisman hopes as

well.

Harrington, on the other hand,
starts off the season with a huge
game against Wisconsin. Most peo-
ple think he and his team are over-
rated this season, so Harrington has
a lot to prove on Saturday.

The two running backs compet-
ing for the Heisman are seniors Lee
Suggs of Virginia Tech and Damien
Anderson of Northwestern.

Suggs has the most promise of
anyone towin the Heisman because
he’s now out of Michael Vick’s
shadow. This year the spotlight is

"on-him. Even if he puts up decent

numbers and Tech goes 9-2 or 8-3,
Suggs will be considered a savior at
Virginia Tech and will be praised
around the nation for saving a
school in need of a leader. Yet
Bryant will have his chance against

Suggs, just like he will against
Dorsey when Virginia Tech comes
to Pitt late in the season.

Anderson has a lot of ground to
cover. His team is on the verge of
cracking the top 25, yet with
Rashidi Wheeler’s tragic death,
Northwestern starts the season on a
low note.

Now what does Antonio Bryant,
the nation’s best wide receiver, have
to do for himself to win the
Heisman?

Let’s examine Pitt first. No"
Heisman winner comes from a
mediocre team. The Panthers need

to put on a show for the nation and -

get Bryant some recognition. Pitt
must beat Syracuse, Boston College
and West Virginia. I don’t think I
need to remind anyone that East
Tennessee State, Alabama-
Birmingham, South Florida, Temple

and Rutgers are all must—wins as

well.

Then comes Notre
Virginia Tech and Miami. Both
Notre Dame and Miami are already
on national television, so Bryant
will get exposure. I’m not going to

A look at Buccaneer football history

Dame, .

J OE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

This Saturday marks the start of a new era
in Panther football. Not only will Pitt play its
first game at Heinz Field, but it will also be
facing the first of three new opponents this
season.

‘ Say hello to the East Tennessee State
University Buccaneers.

The Buccaneers, led by coach Paul
Hamilton, are a Division I—AA team from the
Southern Conference. Hamilton, who is in his
fourth year as the Bucs’ coach, has complied a
23-21 record as ETSU coach, including two
consecutive 6-5 seasons.

Since 1920, when their first team complied
a 3-2 record against local colleges and two
high schools, the Buccaneers have been com-
peting against some of the best Divisionl-AA
teams. .

ETSU had its best season to date in the fall
of 1969, when under head coach John R. Bell,
the Buccaneers finished the season undefeated
with a record of 10-0-1.

The Bucs captured the Ohio Valley
Conference title that year with a 6-0-1 confer-
ence record and finished the season with a 34-
19 victory in the Grantland Rice Bowl over
Terry Bradshaw and Louisiana Tech.

The Bucs have recorded one other 10-win
season. ’

In 1996, ETSU finished with a 10-3 overall

record and finished second in the Southern
Conference. The Bucs made their only NCAA
Division I—AA postseason appearance that year
when they defeated Villanova in the first
round, before being defeated in the quarterfi-
nals by Montana, 44-14. J -

Along with those winning seasons, the
Bucs have also recorded three winless seasons.
The 1930 team went 0-7 under coach J.S;
Batey —— they were surpassed in terms of futil-

ity in, 1971, when ETSU finished 0-9-1 and . 
then again in 1985 by ‘compiling a 0-10-1-

record. _

ETSU has played, only three games against
teams that are currently in the Big East. They
lost twice to1Virginia Tech, and most recently,
the Bucs lost to Miami, 66-17, in 1998.

Six former Bucs have made NFL rosters,
most notably Tampa Bay cornerback Donnie
Abraham, who made his first trip to the Pro
Bowl in 2000. Pedro Edison, a former tight
end, currently plays for the Baltimore Ravens.

Another former ETSU player, George
Cimadevilla, holds the all-time scoring record
in the Arena Football League.

Despite losing quarterback Todd Walker,
who is the Southern Conference’s all-time

leader in passing yards, and eight starters on

defense, Hamilton expects his Buccaneers to
finish the season among the conference’s elite.
That challenge begins tomorrow against a Pitt
team that’s also looking to make a name for
itself. '

sacks last season and set a Big East
record for tackles for losses.

The heart of the Buccaneers
offense lies within its group of
receivers. Leading the squad is Cecil
Moore, who received an NCAA All-
American honorable mention last
season._Moore caught 58 balls last
season for a total of 883 yards.

Another capable receiver is
Charvin Clark, who is one of the
fastest players on the team. Flanker
Tim Turner is also a deep threat.“

Defending the Buccaneer
receivers for Pitt will -be safeties
Mark Ponko and Ramon Walker and
the cornerback combination of
Shawntae Spencer and Torrie Cox.
Walker is on the watch list for the
Jim Thorpe Award, which is present-
ed annually to the nation’s top
defensive back. —

Walker, a junior, has earned All-
Big East honors in each of his first
two seasons. He was the only fresh-
man defensive back in conference
history to earn first team honors in
his freshman year.

Cox gets the start after impress-

ing coaches during summer camp.“

He played running back sparingly
last season and was mostly featured
as a kickoff returner.

The linebacking corps takes a
little different shape for the Panthers
this season.

Redshirt sophomore Lewis
Moore will start at the strong side
position, taking over for his prede-
cessor .Amir Purifoy.

Junior Gerald Hayes returns at
middle linebacker, and Brandon
Williams, another former running
back, gets the nod_at the weak side
position. Brian Beinecke, Ryan
Gonsales and Purifoy will be rotated
in. Look for Brian Guzek and
Claude Harriot to see time at the
defensive end positions.‘

Pitt’s’special teams should be
solid this season. Cox will continue
to return kickoffs, Bryant will return

punts and Nick Lotz will return as '

the team’s placekicker. Andy Lee
will be punting for the team.

Con Chellis will be the
Buccaneers’ place kicker on
Saturday, with Aaron Bass punting.

say Pitt needs to win those games

because that’s a tall order, but

Bryant needs to put up great perfor-
mances in those two games, and Pitt

can’t get blown out.

Then comes the Virginia Tech
game, the last gasp of air before hit-
ting the road for the final two games
and what should be a bowl game.

Not only does Pitt need to sur-
prise the Hokies and beat them, but
David Priestley or Rod Rutherford
will need a monster game like the
performance Priestley put on two
years ago. And it goes without say-
ing that Bryant will need a couple
of touchdown grabs as well.

I believe that the Virginia Tech
game, possibly Bryant’s last home
game in a Panther uniform, will be
the most crucial to his Heisman
hopes. ’

If Pitt can go 9-2, the Panthers
will have placed Bryant in the hunt
for the trophy. Now comes the most
important part: Bryant’s perfor-
mance on the field.

Heisman winners need

All that Bryant ‘did last season
was catch 68 passes for 1,302 yards
and 11 touchdowns. He set the

record for receiving yards for the
Big East Conference and led the

nation with his 19.1 yards per catch.

Antonio, I’ve got bad news for you.
In order to win the Heisman Trophy,
you are going to have to prove to
everyone that the 2000 season was
not just a fluke.

In order for Bryant to be "a"

finalist in the Heisman voting, he
will have to at least match if not

beat the numbers from last year. ,
Bryant isn’t a surprise anymore. ‘

Everyone knows what he can do, so
he will be double- and triple-
teamed.

Bryant’s Heisman Trophy run
depends on a lot of other people and
teams. The road to the Heisman
isn’t easy, but that is why it’s the
hardest trophy in sports to win.

Brian Goldman is a staff writer for
the Pitt News and is ready to watch
Antonio bring the Heisman back to
Pittsburgh, where it belongs.
