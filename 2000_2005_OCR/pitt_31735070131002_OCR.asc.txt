Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme court denied a
petition filed by The Pitt News/VT he case, which
focuseson the constitutionality of a"law enacted

by’ the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, {will

return to District Courtin the coming months.
The Pennsylvania law at the heart of the case

is Act 199, a 199.6 statute that prohibits any

school-related publications from printing “all

I alcoholic beverage.and"malt;b’everage advertis- ‘
ring

The prohibition effectively illegitimizes
alcoholic advertising through school-affiliated
mediums including radio or television broad-
casts, newspapers,. periodicals, outdoor advertis-
ing, booklets, ‘fliers or “any other printed or
graphic matter.” A '

Vic Walczak, the
Pittsburgh American Civil Liberties Union, is

' The Pitt News’ lead counsel in the case. Walczak

saidhe was disappointed, but not surprised, by
the high court’s.refu,sa1-to hear the case“; ‘ S

WEATHER — Today: ostly Ioudy High: 30s Thursday:

    High   court rejects Pitt

“Personally, I’m not surprised,” he said. “We.

were not real hopeful that they would take our
case?’ -' ‘ V

The Pitt News’ petition maintains that by
dictating acceptable -advertisement content, the
commonwealth of Pennsylvania is effectively

limiting free speech, a constitutional guarantee

outlined in the First Amendment..Th_e paperand ‘

the ACLU as-sert that prohibiting alcohol adver-
tising minimizes potential profits,'j\thereby pre-
venting the ‘paper from keeping upwith competi-
tors. ‘ 1 . V 
According to Walczak, the length of each

‘issue of The Pitt News, as well as the paper’s

ability to purchase new equipment to -remain
competitive are both affected by the law.

The commonwealth defends its statute, hold-
ing_ that The Pitt News cannot assert the.First
Amendment ri_ghts of third parties. The common-
wealth said that the parties directly affected by

the statute are readers and advertisers, and that-
both are capable of bringing suit against the law

themselves. I v ,

News appeal

denied in April 2000 when Standish deemed that
the paper could not assert First Amendment
rights for a third party.

The case was again» denied in June 2000
when x the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that while The Pitt News does have standing, or

is an appropriateparty to file suit in the case, its

rights had not been violated.

Because the Third Circuit Court, which is
above the District Court, ruled that the paper
does have the right to assert First Amendment

rights in the case, Walczak now plans to return to

the District Court where he will present evidence
to substantiate the paper’s claim.

“[‘Standish] actually has not considered any‘
of the arguments,” rWalczak said.

Pitt News Editor in Chief Rehan Nasir said
the paper will continue to fight thestatute.

“I certainly hope that the court’s hearing will

take all of the evidence into consideration and

overturn this ridiculous law,” he said.
Nasir said he remains optimistic that the case

willbe‘ decided inpthe paper’s. favor, but is still .

disappointedthat other papers in Pennsylvania
didn’t join The Pitt News in its suit.

More than 100 people weaved
their way through the first floor of
Posvar Hall for the spring semester’s
Meet the Greeks night yesterday. The
event kicked off the spring rush sea-
son for the Greek community, which
runs through Jan. 26. ’

Eleven sororities and almost

the event, which ran from 8:30 pm.
to 10:30 pm. Each group set up a

turnout. Spring rush is usually small-
er than fall rush. ,

“Spring rush is always weak,”
said Pat Cleaver, a brother of Delta
Phi. Cleaver said the spring rush
turnout is smaller because there are
more new students on campus in th
fall than in the spring. A

For the sororities, another major
difference is that each sorority may
have a maximum of 60 sisters at any
one time. In the spring, there are
always a‘ few sororities who cannot
participate in rush because they
already have 60 members. '

Sororities want to be ‘able to
increase their total memberships, so
this spring each sorority is trying to
have 60 members. If they are suc-
cessful, the number of sisterseach
sorority is allowed to have will

jincrease.

Pitt Libertarians ho

ROB GEBHART

Staff Writer

Mark Rauterkus, mayoral candi-
date, calls himself a scraper.

He calls Pittsburgh a house with
peeling paint that needs to be
cleaned up, and the stay-at-home dad
and former swimming coach consid-
ers himself just the tool for the job.

Rauterkus, 41, took one of the
first steps in his “Quixotic Campaign
of Hope” last night, making his first
public speech to the Pitt
Libertarians.

Rauterkus announced his candi-
dacy at a city council meeting in
August, after his application to join
the Pittsburgh swimming pool task
force was rejected.

Rauterkus, who has never held a
public office, has yet to announce if
he will run on the Republican or
Libertarian ticket. But regardless of
which party he chooses, Rauterkus
acknowledges his campaign will be
difficult.

No Republican has been elected
to any Pittsburgh office — from
mayor to dog catcher — since 1932,
Rauterkus said. And though he has
been largely ignored by both the

Post—Gazette and Tribune Review, he
would receive even less press cover-
age as “the third party heck1er,” he
said.

Rauterkus spent most of the
meeting fielding questions from the
audience of about 20 students and
adults. His ideas at this point are
sketchy; he knows he wants to write
a book, which will say “Compelling
Sense” on the cover (a take-off of
Thomas Paine’s “Common Sense”),
but he isn’t sure what the pages in
between will say.

Several students asked him,
“What is your platform?” and
Rauterkus only answered with talk
of building a fantastic swimming and
fitness center Downtown, which
would be the “Eiffel Tower of
YMCAs.”

But Rauterkus has solid ideas as
well. He wants to eliminate the
sewer and water authorities, replac-
ing them with elected positions
rather than the government—appoint—
ed officials in charge at this time. He
has similar plans for the city’s parks,
and would like to give Mellon Arena
to the city’s public schools so they
would receive the Penguins’ rent
money. .

The speech nearly turned ugly

Pitt Pathfinders walk

KAT FIELDS

said.

The Pitt News

The Pathfinders enter Eddie’s,
which is full of college students
eating their chicken sandwiches and
laughing withtheir friends. As the
group works its way through the
crowded cafeteria, it’s not uncom-
mon-to see students roll their —eyes

a as aflock of high‘ school students

and their families pass by.
While college students may find
this common sight annoying, this is

how Pitt attracts prospective stu-

dents. .

The Pitt Pathfinders is a group
of undergraduate students whose
purpose is to" convey the “student
perspective” to high school stu-
dents and their families.

“The student perspective is
telling your own stories about Pitt,”
said Chris Meaner, president of
Pathfinders. The group encourages
its members to include personal
anecdotes when talking with stu-
dents.

“This

is what we tell our

VPathfinders to do to help the

prospective students get a different
View of the University,” Meaner

Tours begin every hour on the
hour from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

The “student perspective”
includes learning where the best
places on campus are to study, it
means learning_ I where the best
places are.to eat on Forbes Avenue
and it means visiting.a dorm room
in the infamous Towers. But most
importantly, it shows students how
things work at Pitt as opposed to
them simply reading about it in a
booklet. .

The 1 1/2 hour tour includes
information students might not read
in the traditional literature about
the University.

For example, prospective» stu-

‘ dents learn that the Cathedral of
Learning boasts 2,529 windows and —

that Babe Ruth hit his last two

A home runs at Forbes Field.

Pathfinders also telephone
prospective students to answer their

1 questions. Each Pathfinder devotes

at" least two hours a week to tele-

I marketing.

A Pathfinder must be willing to
devote a total of five hours a week
to the organization, which includes

through life backward

tours, telemarketing, attending on-
and off—campus recruitment pro-
grams and a weekly meeting. Most
of the people involved in the orga-
nization have other commitments,
so Pathfinders are willing to work
with people on an individual basis.
In order to represent the
University in style, the Office of
Admissions and Financial Aid gives
freeiuniforms to each Pathfinder.

But each member is responsible for .

50 hours of fund raising. This can
be accomplished by selling rafﬂe

tickets or being a security guard at _

a Pirates game. ‘
Pathfinders are enthusiastic
about Pitt and express their excite-

,ment when they explain why they

enjoy being a Pathfinder.

‘.‘When I took my tour my senior
year, I thought it was really some-
thing cool and knew it was some-
thing I wanted to do when I came to
Pitt,”~’ I said sophomore Mike
Jennings.

Other Pathfinders take pride in
helping high school seniors make
one of the biggest decisions of their
lives.

“I wanted to be involved in peo- ‘

ple’s decision to go to Pitt,” said
junior Myles Schwartz. “And the

Pathfinders are the best at what I
they do. You see that when you go

to other schools.”

A The Pathfinders have proven to
be the best organization on campus.
Student Government-Board award-
ed the organization -“Overall
Organization of the Year” in both
1998 and 1999.

Students interested in joining-
the 95—member organization can
pick up applications this week in
the Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid -in the Masonic
Temple.

But because of the large number
of responses that they receive each
semester, they have to make certain
limitations to who they hire. The-
Pathfinders have to take people
from certain majors and demo-
graphics in order to have as diverse
a group as possible so incoming
freshmen can relate to their tour
guide.‘

“We look for people who have
stories about Pitt to bring to the
organization. We _look for people
with great communication skills,
who havethe ability to listen well
and have the charisma to lead a

tour,” Meaner said.

  Go east, young men and women,
and watch the inauguration

Two major events will hap-
pen in Washington, D.C., this
Saturday: the inauguration of
George W. Bush as the 43rd
president of the United States at
noon and Pitt’s basketball game

against Georgetown at 7 p.m..
While the inauguration is just,

slightly more important than the
basketball game, the two events
combined should motivate you
to take that four hour drive. _

You should go to
Washington this Saturday. In
the United States, a president’s
term lasts from noon on Jan. 20
to noon on Jan. 20 four years.
later. Hence, it is a once-in-an-
olympiad event.

Whether or not you support-
ed Bush ‘during the election,
support him now.or even think‘
that he was legitimately elected

president, this is an event worth‘

attending. Any inauguration is
history. For most of us, this is
our only" chance during our
undergraduate’ careers to wit-

.ness something like this. And

who knows if-you will be living
this_close to Washington again?

Besides, no matter what
your political _ leanings,

‘ Saturday will be an exciting day

in Washington. There will be

massive partying throughout
the capital district, something
most college students cannot
refuse.

Many will be there protest-
ing the inauguration. While
exercising one’s right to free
speech is commendable,
attempting to disrupt the inau-
guration is not. The fact is that
George W- Bush is our next
president. We should respect
and accept this, and the inaugu-
ration should not be disturbed.
Besides, there will be plenty of
opportunities to protest in the
future and to.let him know if
you do not like what he is
doing. '

And then after you’ve
attended the. inauguration and
all the festivities, you’ll need to
find something to do‘ at night.
Unless you’re one of the few
invited to the Inaugural Ball,
Why not go to the MCI Center
by 7 p.m.« to attend the Pitt-
Georgetown basketball game
and cheer our team to victory?

So Friday or Saturday, get
onto the Pennsylvania Turnpike
and head east to Washington,
D.C. You may not have another
chance to see something this
big any time in the near future.

More reasons to love television

“Television: teacher, mother... secret
lover!” These immortal ‘words of Homer

Simpson sum up the relationship millions of

Americans share with television. TV programs
are of particular interest to First Amendment
activists such as myself; the constitutional guar-
antee of freedom of speech has given TV writ-
ers and producers the space to create some of
our culture’s most enduring, and
most inﬂuential, ﬁctional char-
acters.

Last year, the venerable TV
Guide magazine paid tribute to
this heritage of great TV charac-
ters in its Oct. 16-22 issue. In addition to Homer
Simpson, TV Guide declared such diverse char-
acters as Archie Bunker (“All in the Family”),
Mary Richards (“The Mary Tyler Moore
Show”), Hawk (“Spenser For Hire”) and Mr.
Spock (“Star Trek”) as numbering among TV’s
50 greatest characters.

I heartily endorse the editors’ selections.
And I would like to take this opportunity to
respectfully name my choices for numbers 51
through 55 of TV’s greatest characters.

#51: Natalie Green from “The Facts of
Life” e One of TV’s greatest failings has been
its tendency to focus on unrealistic images of
female body size. In Natalie, brought to life by
Mindy Cohn, adolescent girls finally got a role
model who was not only full—f1gured but fully
developed as a character. Natalie exempliﬁed
“girl power” long before the Spice Girls made
it a catch phrase.

#52: Louise Jefferson from “All -in the
Family” and “The Jeffersons” —- An upwardly
mobile black wife and mother, Louise, played
by the great Isabel Sanford, was a real ground-
breaker. I’ll never forget the “All in the Family”
episode where Louise, saying goodbye to her
white friend Edith Bunker, embraced her and
said," “I love you.” That powerful scene of inter-
racial friendship had a profound inﬂuence on
me.

#53: Apu Nahasapeemapetilon from “The
Simpsons” — Voiced by Hank Azaria, Apu is
probably the first fully developed Hindu char-
acter ever to appear on an American TV pro-

gram. I’m inspired by Apu’s ongoing struggle
to be true to his cultural and religious heritage
in the midst of rampant American consumerism
and xenophobia. He has a great singing voice
1:00. '

#54: The Robot from “Lost in Space” -
.Ironically, TV’s cheesiest space opera spawned
one of the medium’s most endearing characters.
‘ The combination of Dick Tufeld’s
expert vocal performance, stunt-
man Bob May’s work from within
the robot costume and the inspired
design of the “bubble-headed
booby” itself created an ur1forget—
table pop-culture icon. Unfailingly loyal, coura-
geous and honorable, the Robot was the best
friend every little kid should have had.

#55: Carl Kolchak from “The Night
Stalker” — The series may have been short-
lived, but the‘ legacy of its monster-hunting
hero, portrayed by Darren McGavin, lives on in

such pop-culture phenomena as ‘The X-Files.” I

An iconoclastic loner, Kolchak creeped me out
as he tenaciously pursued the truth about a
bizarre parade of vampires, demons and other
horrors. But none of these ghouls ever really
stole the spotlight from Kolchak, whose unique
mix of sarcasm and vulnerability made him one
of horror television’s most unusual heroes.

Each of these ﬁve characters was entertain-
ing in his or her own unique way. But for me
they went beyond mere entertainment; like
some of my favorites from TV Guide’s list,
-these ﬁve personalities reﬂected many of the
values and controversies that have shaped our
world.

Many of the insights I learned from
Natalie, Louise, ‘Apu, the Robot and Kolchak
continue to mold my moral vision.

And I thus leave you with my additions to
TV Guide’s top 50. Do, you have any to add to
these 55? If so, send your suggestions to The
Pitt News; if we get enough (and if my editor
likes the idea), maybe we’ll print our own sup-
plemental list. ‘ '

Mike Mazza may have spent lzis life watchin

far too much television. '

Billboard is not such a bad thing

Two years ago I took a gender studies
class that should -really have been called
Feminist Studies l0l. I decided not to drop
it, thinking that I, would learn something
about how the mind of the opposite sex
worked That class certainly was hell.

When I wasn’t being cruciﬁed for sim-
ply having a penis, I actually learned some
intaesting things. I especially learned about
women and how they are portrayed in ads.

_ You see, there is a long history of adver-
tisers portraying women in offensive ways. I

of this, such as ads of men’
beating women and of women
screaming in delight over a
new vacuum cleaner. But I
also saw people in that class
oveneact, especiallyif the ad made a joke
that could be taken the wrong way.
Oneadinpart;icularstoodout.Thisad
featured a supposedly dead woman with her
feet sticking out of a garbage can. Next tothe
can was a brokenshoe store window. with
women’s shoes strewn about.-The tag line
read, “These shoes are worth killing for.” j
I got the joke and, in fact, thought it was
pretty funny. But all the militant, angry fem-

LEE

vinists didn’tseeitthe samewaythatldidln

_fact, they didn’t like one single ad on display.
A So the fact that the billboard on Forbes
angered some people didn’t surprise me. I
didn’t think it was that bad —_I even found
some humor in it. It featured a healthy, toned
and attractive woman who was naked. All
the fun stuff was tastefully covered up. The
tag line read, “You could stop trafﬁc too.”
Wow! Do you hear that? That’s the
sound of every angry feminist screaming.

Do you hear what they’re screaming? .

They’re saying three things: 1) The ad is
exploiting women. 2) The ad is objectifying
women. 3) The ad is portraying an ideal that
is impossible to achieve.

Well, let me get serious now. Let’s arra-
lyze their objections.

1) The ad is exploiting women.

What? Did the photographer put a gun
to that mode1’s head and then say, “Strip!”
Did they not pay the model? Isn’t she likely
enjoying the exposure from the billboard?

Apparently most ferrrirrists ﬁnd it hard
to believe that women can enjoy their sexu-
ality. They ﬁnd it hard to believe that
women, dare I say, might enjoy posing nude
and getting paid for it. So they whine and say
that it’s exploitation. Well, I-don’t buy it. If
that’s the case, then I wish someone would
comeuptomewitlracamera,abagof
money and then proceed to exploit me over
and over again.

2) The ad is objectifying women.

Yes, the ad objectiﬁed the woman. (Oh
my god, I just agreed with the feminists.

STEIN

S’lI\I“l“  Rl'l’l{ R

 

Wait a minute, let me check if Mr. Happy is
still there. Whew!) But so what? So does
every other TV commercial, movie and
music video. The goal of advertising is to
present you with something (a car, a T—shirt,
a body) that you want to possess. T‘hat’s
what drives that thing called capitalism.

Besides that, every time you admire
someone, you’re objectifying him or her.
You break that person down by his or her
butt, legs, eyes or whatever, then judge that
person and decide which parts you like. It’s
normal. It’s human nature.
And despite what feminists
tell you, nothing is wrong with
doing it.

3) The ad presented an
ideal that’s impossible to
achieve and pressures women to look like
her.

Well, not really. The girl wasn’t anorex-
ic, she was just ﬁt. Sure, you nright not have
the genetics to have the “perfect 10” body,

but the whole idea of the ad was to present‘

you with a. picture of what you could look

. like if you worked out.

And if you’re the type of person that
seesanadfeaturingaprettygirlandthen
starves yourself you don’t look like
her, don’t blame the ad Blame yourself for
being so weak and easyto upset Ifyou are
that sensitive, how do you even go out dur-
ing the day? Doesn’t that bright ball in the
sky frighten you too? In that case, please
send me $100, care of the Pitt News, and I
will guarantee you eternal happiness.

Oh, and one last thing. I want to say
something to the person who defaced the
billboard.

You should be ashamed of yourself.
You basically said, “I’m irrrrnature. I have no
idea how to express myself in a proper way.
I could protest or write a letter to the local
newspapers or even lodge a complaint with
Idea Mill. But instead, it’s more fun to break
the law and look like a corrrplete idiot. So I’ll
go and deface it because I’m too stupid to do
anything e .”

You should realize that you could have
brought attention to this issue in a much
more  way. I’m sure there are reli-
gious organizations and feminist groups that
would have loved to protest this. You could
have even come to the Pitt News and written
an  All you have to be is a student
who likes to argue, which you obviously are.

Thankfully, yesterday there was a copy
of that billboard in the Pitt News. So now, I
can put it up in my room and objectify that
woman any time I want. ’

Is the Extreme Fitness billboard good or bad?

Billboard is wrong and offensive

Last week, the company Extreme

Fitness created quite a controversy with its _

ad of a naked model on a billboard Now
they have inserted that ad in a newspaper.

It wo11ld be nice if corrrpanies did not
think only about proﬁts, but actually cared
about the potentially negative ramiﬁcations
of their ads.

The emphasis that certain segments of
society place on having a beautiful body is
affecting college women who want to
appear slim and sexy to society. The bill-
board of the naked woman is supposed to
tell a woman that if she comes to Extreme
Fitness, she could have a body like that

Regardless of what companies do, not
everyone will look like the woman in the ad.
What nright-happen instead
is that people will become
anorexic or bulimic if they
become so obsessed with
having a ﬁgure like that

Andy Dehnart, a junior
at Stetson University in DeLand, Fla,
reported for Studentcom that college stu-
dents are particularly vulnerable to main-
stream notions of “perfection” as they try to
ﬁt into new adult models. A

Alma Smith, a clinical social worker at
Stetson, stated, “Popular media promotes an
image that equates everything with ‘the
look’ The way we value the body certainly
contributes to eating disorders.”

Everything should not be equated with
“the look,” as ads often tell us. Someone can
appear incredibly beautiful on the outside
but have a heart of stone. A godly character
is what should matter more than “the look.”

This does not mean that exercise and a
healthy lifestyle should be ignored. Personal
ﬁtness is very important, but not to the point
that a person becomes physically or emo-

tionally sick.

‘ Anadlikethatcanalsom akei itdiﬂicult"
for students who are offended by pomogra-

phy. Sadly, "it affects many men. The last

thirrg women need is for men to be looking
at them as pornographic ﬁgures. The ad
insert does not diminish that struggle. ‘
When that happens, women are not
loved for who they are, but for what men can
get out of them. I11 other words, women
beconre objects, exploited for men’s self-
gratiﬁcation. ~ _
A former student told me that she broke
up with her boyfriend because he cared
more for her looks than her personality.

" When she shared this with me, I was
taken aback by what she said but was very
impressed, because alﬂrough she was beau-
 she did not want to be loved forthat
reason. Often I hear students across campus
using slang terms such as “chick’ 7 when they
are planning to pursue someone. When I

RAMESH

S'riAr‘r‘ WRl'l'|{R

 

hear that, I think to myself that they are
going out with someone who they perceive
as beautiful on the outside without knowing
her character.

A When attention is focused on more than
a person’s character, low self—esteem or a
negative self—irnage can result

If any guy tells a girl to go to Extreme
Fitness, he does not have the right attitude
toward her. She is not an object to be shaped
like he wants her to be. Objects can be con-
trolled to ‘look like what humans want ‘them
to look like. But women are not objects.

When women are treated or seen as
objects by men, we have crimes like rape.

“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not
envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is
not rude, it is not self—seeking, it
is not easily angered, /it keeps no
record of wrongs. Love does
not delight in evil but rejoices
with the truth. It always pro-
tects, always trusts, always
hopes, always perseveres” (1 Corinthians
13:4—7).

Beauty does not always last, but a heart
of love does. True love can look beyond the
shape of a body. Women are not objects to be
showcased for other people’s gratiﬁcation.

When men go to strip bars and clubs, it
isnotjusttohaveadrinkorﬂirtwith
women, but instead to subconsciously enjoy
women who succumb to allowing tlrem—
selves to be exploited in their nudity.

I have heard interviews wiﬂr women
who were strippers because it was theorrly
way to ﬁnancially support themselves. This
ad is not far from that reality.

The ad is not about live women who are

showcasing their nudity, but about a woman
who agreed to showcase herself without
clothes to thousands of people. We do not

know why she‘ did it, but I repeat: It is T
V exploitation of her body for Iglroﬁt. .

Neither men ' nor worrien should be
treated as objects. Since this ad is about a
naked woman, you should boycott" Extreme
Fitness if you love your girlﬁiend or wife.
You should also tell everyone else to boycott
it,becausethatcompanytreats awomanas
an object and exploits her body.

Ifyouwantherto gotothatgym, Ifeel A
sorry for you. Ads like that make women -

look cheap to society and necessitate more
“Take Back the Night” rallies. Let’s be hon-
est: .Most of these  are more for
women than men. We would never need
these rallies if women were not exploited or
seen as objects.

Murphy’s law denies Pitvictor

All-American forward propels
Fighting Irish past Panthers

JON SOBOLEWSKI

The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s basketball team continued
its road struggles last night, falling to a pow-
erful Notre Dame team, 74-58. The 16-point
defeat was the Panthers’ fourth loss in a row
on the road and second in which their oppo-
nent held more than a 20-point lead.

Notre Dame led by 22 at the half, and the
game looked to be completely out of reach,
but the Panthers started the second half on a
12-2 run to cut the deficit to 12.

At the 13:08 mark, Toree Morris convert-
ed one of two free throws, and Big East
Preseason Player of the Year Troy Murphy
left the game because of blood on his jersey.

The margin was 11 at this point, with Pitt i

doing exactly what head coach Ben Howland
asked of his team.

“Our goal was to get the lead to ten with
ten minutes to go,” Howland said. “We just
didn’t make the shots to cut into the lead like
we had hoped to.”

On three different occasions the Panthers
could have cut the lead to single digits with a
basket, but they could never take advantage.
At one point with the deficit at 10, the
Panthers had four possessions but could not
score on any of them. With 11:15 to go, a

Ryan Humphrey basket, followed 23 seconds
later by a Murphy steal, ended in a fast—break
dunk, and Notre Dame went up by 14 points.

The Notre Dame lead eventually grew to
22, but two late three-pointers by freshmen
Jaron Brown and Julius Page in the last 75
seconds brought the final score to 74-58, the
second worst loss of the season for the
Panthers. ’ -

The Irish had lost three of four, including
an 82-71 loss to unranked Kentucky, in which
leading scorer Murphy was held to only 14
points on six—of-15 shooting. Last night,
Murphy got back on track, scoring 23 points,
right on his average. Murphy’s hard work in
the lane contributed to Panthers forward
Donatas Zavackas fouling out.

Zavackas, one , of the heroes of the
Panthers’ upset over Seton Hall, could not get
going on either end of the court, scoring only
three points. Zavackas waged war in the paint
with Murphy, but in the process he did not
catch many breaks, only a few elbows.

Howland commented on Murphy’s physi-
cal play, saying, “Murphy’s a real good play-
er, and he is going to get some calls.”

Howland appeared less concerned with
Murphy’s physical play and more with the
Panthers’ poor play.

Injury-plagued Panthers

Sports Editor

Pitt’s wrestling team took on
Ohio State last Friday in a dual
meet that was billed as a battle
between two nationally-ranked‘
teams.

But that was not the case, as the
24th-ranked Panthers wrestled
without all three of its wrestlers
who are each ranked in the top 25 in
their weight classes. No. 16 Ohio
State had all of its wrestlers
healthy. Despite the handicap, Pitt
stayed close throughout the meet

before losing 25-11.

“That score is very misleading,”
said Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. “We were wrestling
without a bunch of guys, and we
still had a chance to‘ win.”

Ohio State took an early lead
when Ryan Hieber defeated Pitt’s
Brendan O’Connell, 7-1, in the
174-pound weight class. The deci-
sion victory put OSU up 3-0 over-
all.

But Pitt came back with another
big win from junior Dan Stine.

The Pitt News

Pitt’s men’s swimming and div-
ing team returned from the winter
break ranked No. 15 in the nation.
The Panthers’ first test in the sec-
ond half of the season was against
23rd-ranked Penn State at State
College on Friday afternoon. ‘

The Nittany Lions dominated
Pitt in almost every event and set
two pool records doing it. The final
score had PSU on top, 140-98.

“They had a much better team
than I had thought,” said Pitt head
coach Chuck Knoles, who is in his
11th season as coach. ,

One bright spot for the Panthers
was the 400—meter freestyle relay.
The relay team of Mike Grube,
Miah Heath, Adam Webber and Max
von Bodungen set a McCoy
Natatorium pool record of three
minutes, 0.07 seconds.

Other than in that relay event,
the Lions clearly outswam their vis-
iting rivals.

“We got our teeth kicked in
there,” Knoles said. ”There’s noth-
ing wrong with that as long as you
learn something.”

The women’s swimming and
diving team had better luck and a
better outcome resuming their
schedule after the winter break.

On Friday at Trees Pool, the

women’s team hosted St. Francis
(Pa.).

The Panther squad was tri-
umphant, 134-79, improving its
record to 4-5 on the season.

On Saturday, the men’s team
had a shot at redemption for its pre-

‘vious outing, and the women’s team ‘ 9

had’ an opportunity to continue its
momentum in the pool.

Both teams, welcomed rival
West Virginia University to Trees
Pool in the swimming version of the
Backyard Brawl.

The Big East meet» began at
noon, with the two Panther teams
ready for competition.

“On the bus from State College
they [the men’s team] thought about
how to approach today’s meet
[against WVU],” Knoles said.

Apparently a tough defeat like
the one,agains't Penn State is just
what the team— needed.

A The men’s squad started hot out
of the blocks with the first race and
continued, until the meet was over.

 The first race of the afternoon
was the 400 medley relay. Pitt

swimmers Ken Shelhorse, Randy?

Gertenbach, Patrick Shedlock and
Heath were victorious with a time
of 3:26.78.

Shelhorse and Heath also won
the 200 individual medley and 200
free races, respectively.

The Panthers’ diving events
were led by_ junior Michael Wells,

who finished in first for 1- and 3-

Once again the men’s 400
freestyle relay team of Grube,
Heath, ‘Webber and von ‘Bodungen

set a record. -
They finished at 3:01.64, whic

is third fastest this season in the Big

East. The Panthers now own the
three fastest times this year in the
event.

Other notable victories of the
meet were freshman , Eric
Limkemann in the 1,000 freestyle
and Grube in the 50 freestyle.

The Panthers won all but one
race. The final ‘score was 142-91.

Don’t expect a h‘igh—scoring Super Bowl

Sunday’s conference champi-
onships affirmed a saying that has
been around for years. Defense wins
championships.

The Baltimore Ravens used the
league’s top defense to shut down
the vaunted Oakland Raiders’
attack. The New York Giants, while
displaying an offensive juggernaut
not seen during the regular season,
still punished the Minnesota
Vikings with an outstanding defen-
sive effort in a 41-0 win.

Since it has now been proven
that those two teams won primarily
with defense, let’s take a look at
what to expect when they meet up in
Tampa on Jan. 28. I

- Well, for one thing, expect ‘

more Budweiser commercials than
points in this game. I had already
determined that the score would be
3-2, but I wasn’t sure who was
going to win. So I did what any true
sports fan would do. I ﬂipped a
coin. Ravens 3, Giants 2.

“This was our worst game of the
year, and it was really disheartening
coming off of our best performance
of the season,” he said.

Howland said that the Panthers
have a lot to improve on after last
night’s game.

“We played bad in every phase
of the game,” Howland said. “We

could not finish on the break and_

missed a lot of open shots.”

The Panthers shot 31 percent
from the ﬂoor and could not create
many opportunities in the lane
because of H_umphrey’s and
Murphy’s shot—blocking ability. The
Irish finished with 11 blocks,
including four by Murphy.

Also, the Panthers continued to
turn the ball over, hitting their sea-
son average of 18 in the game,
which ranks second to last in the
Big East.

One of the major disappoint-
ments of the game was the surpris-
ing shooting struggles of the
Panthers’ second leading scorer,
Julius Page. i

The freshman managed to only

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 17, 2001'
score six points on two—of—six
shooting.

“We have got to get Julius more
aggressive. After he missed a con-
ple of open jumpers, he stopped
shooting,” Howland said. ‘

One of the few bright spots for
the Panthers was the play of red-
shirt freshman point guard Jaron
Brown.

Brown, who has now started two

consecutive games, scored a career— .

high 12 points and hit his first two
three—pointers of the season.

Pitt started the game shooting
zero of 11 from the floor and turned
the ball over four times before
junior guard Zelimir Stevanovic hit
a three-pointer from the wing with
14:19 to play.

After the 6:30 mark in the first
half, the Irish. outscored the

Panthers 17-5 to [make the halftime

score 40-18.

The Panthers will take on the j _

undefeated Georgetown Hoyasiat
7:30 ' p.m. on Saturday in
Washington, D.C. .
“We have to really regroup for
Saturday, we are playing the best
team in the conference,” Howland

~said.

points for those events and making
the final score closer than it could
have been.

The men’s team responded to
the pounding by Penn State in an
attempt to prove it belongs in the
top 25. '

The Panthers improved their
record to 6-2 and 3-0 in the Big
East.

“The guys wanted to show that

FROM PAGE 10

they remembered how to race. They-

wanted to show themselves and the
coaching staff that they had the
right attitude needed to swim fast
and get_ better,” Knoles said. “I
think they were successful doing
that.” .

Like the men’.s team, ‘the
women’s team also dominated its
Big East rival.

Head coach Marian Cassidy
Keen lead her team to a 141-75 vic-

tory. The win moves the squad to 5-
5 overall “and 2-2 in Big East.

The team received an outstand-
ing effort from Carolyne Savini. By
herself, she won the 200 individual
medley and the 200 backstroke
events. /

She was also victorious as a
member of the 400 medley relay,
with help‘ from teammates Ryan
Redman, Jaymie Van Kooten and
Lindsay 'Weaverling. E’

Both teams will take to the road
together swimming in dual meet
this weekend. ‘ ‘ .

The Panthers take onan out-of-
conference matchup on Friday at
Maryland. ’

Then on Saturdayboth squads
will battle in Philadelphia against
Big East competitor Villanova.

On Jan. 27, the men’s and
women’s swimming and diving
teams will wrap up their Big East
competition with a dual home meet
at Trees Pool against Virginia Tech.

WRESTLE

Knupp clinched iPitt’s comeback
win over Penn State the previous
weekend, faced off against Anton
Talamantes at the 184-pound divi-
sion.

Talamantes, ranked 16th in the
country, wrestled a tough first peri-
od that ended scoreless. Stine got
an escape to start the second period
and followed that up with a take-
down for a 3-0 lead entering the
third period. Then Stine dominated,
scoring eight points in the period en
route to a 11-2 major decision.

“Danny was amazing today,”
Stottlemyer said. “I don’t know
what else I can say about him.”

The 197-pound match

FROM PAGE 9

saw

OSU’s Nick Preston in control
throughout the match on his way to
a 9-4 victory over Pittfs David
Sandberg. The win put the
Buckeyes up 6-4 in the match.

The heavyweight matchup was

as tough as it was expected to be for,

the Panthers. OSU’s Tommy
Rowlands, a redshirt freshman,
came into the match ranked N o. 1 in
the nation with a 20-2 record. He
proved why he’s first in the nation
with a dominating 17-7 victory
against Jacob Lininger. The four
points earned from the major deci-

sion put Ohio State up 10-4 overall. '

With one match left before half-
time, Pitt needed to swing the
momentum. Junior Shawn Amistade
battled Kore Sharpley in a close
match, but a third period takedown

pushed Amistade over the top in a
4-1 decision to bring Pitt within
three points overall.

“Shawn did a great job in that
match,” Stottlemyer said.

Ohio State had a lineup that
included ranked wrestlers in the
next three weight classes, but that
didn’t deter the Panthers.

Jeff Ratliff, ranked 17th at 133
pounds, took on Joe Crecca, a fresh-
man who substituted for the injured
Rob Loper. Loper, - the nation’s

sixth-ranked wrestler, is out with a’

high ankle sprain.

A hard—fought first period saw
Crecca up 3-2, but then he dominat-
ed the second, winning it 5-0 to go
up 8-2 going into the third. Crecca
didn’t stop there, accumulating four
more points and giving up just one

escape point, to win the match in a
major decision, 12-3.

The 141—pound match was
expected to be a duel between 17th-
ranked Justin Giovinco of Pitt and
9th-ranked Robert Sessley of Ohio
State. But with Giovinco injured,
Pitt moved Zach Hasse up to wres-
tle in the contest.

Hasse, who weighed in around
133 pounds, was clearly overpow-
ered throughout in the 13-3 victory.

“Zach showed a lot of heart,”
Stottlemyer said. “But he just strug-
gled to compete.”

Ohio State’s 149-pounder

Keaton Anderson dominated that-
match. Anderson took on_Pitt’s Matt,

Kaus and ran_up 13* points in the
third period on his way to a 20-4
technical fall. Because Anderson
also recorded a near fall, Ohio State
added five points~1j.-o its team score
to make the score 19-11.

It appeared that the Panthers
would not be able‘ to come back
from the deficit, needing a pinfall
and a decision win to take the con-
test.

At 157 pounds, freshman Zach
Doll tried to fulfill half of the equa-
tion, going for an’ early takedown
and a near fall that almost resulted

\ in a pin for the Panthers.

But, then Doll’s inexperience
showed, as he let an 8-3 lead slip
away. Josh Janson ‘battled back to
win the third ‘period 8-4, and to take
the match 15-14. The win made the

"overall score 22-ll. ,

With the match already decided,
Stottlemyer decided not to start
Carl Fronhofer, ranked 13th at 165
pounds. Fronhofer’s replacement,
Matt Catullo, lost to John Clark, 13-
4, to seal the Panthers’ fate.

“We’re disappointed,”
Stottlemyer said. “But we’re getting
better.”

The Panthers are now 3-2 over-

all and will host Cleveland State
tonight at 7:30 p.m.
