Peace protestends in arrest

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

A marc_h against the United
States’ current occupation of Iraq
came to a sudden end when one man
was ‘arrested alongiFifth Avenue on
Sunday.

The march was part of an after-
noon that included apotluck picnic
and a rally,‘organized by the Thomas
Merton Center and the Pittsburgh
Organizing Group.

During the rally in Schenley Park, .

police cars remained stationed above
Flagstaff Hill, across from Phipps
Conservatory. But when the rally
ended and the march began, police
cars followed about one hundred

marchers through Carnegie Mellon

University’s campus, across Forbes
Avenue to Fifth Avenue, and toward
Pitt. -
After crossing Forbes Avenue,
many of the marchersbegan to walk
in the streets. But when the marchers
reached Craig Street, one of the police
officers following the group in his car
warned marchers to return to the side-

walk or be arrested.

Tim Vining, TMC’s executive
director, said the policeman’s request
that the marchers return to the side-
walk was reasonable, because the
marchers had not sought a permit
beforehand. ’

Marchers continued down Fifth

SGB-USSA Connection questioned

J. ELlZABETH STROHM
News Editor

When the Student
Government Board‘ orga-
nized a “Get Out the Vote”
campaign last year to

encourage students to vote-

in national, state and local
elections, they worked
with material provided by
the Unites States Student
Association.

Because USSA, ‘fund-
ed by Pitt through an affil-
iation with SGB, supports
Roe v. Wade and takes
other political positions,
they lost the support of

some students, including
current SGB member Scott
Morely.

“They’re basically, as

far» as I can tell, a socialist 0'
' organization,”
said, adding that SGB’s

Morely

support of USSA. is ‘‘way
beyond the realm of what
SGB should be doing.”

To earn campus mem-
ber status in the national
group, Pitt must pay annu-
al dues of $1,000, deter-
mined by the size of the
undergraduate student
body. The dues cover all
of the undergraduate stu-
dents at Pitt, effectively

giving membership to
every student.’

But Morely said that
not all students support the
ideas of USSA — a group

‘that he called “ultra-liber-

al” —-— and he believes the
group belongs among the

ranks of other independent
. student organizations.

Morely has suggested
that students vote in the
next‘ SGB election whether
or not to change USSA_’s
status.

' “It’s like we’re saying,
‘All students at Pitt
believe this,’” Morely
said. “There’s no way a

majority of this campus
agrees with‘ even half of

_ their stuff.”

USSA regional chair

_ Jen Stephan, a Pitt student

who attended this sum-
mer’s USSA national con-
ference in California with
SGB member Todd
Brandon Morris, defended
the importance of USSA’s
role in representing all
students in national issues
that make college a feasi-
ble option for many stu-
dents. ,

New computer  
Virus could slow
Pitt’s network

J. ELIZABETH STROHM..
News Editor

A worm gets into your system
and begins shutting things down. A
virus spreads to everyone with
whom you‘ come into contact.

These problems aren’t part of
an epidemic, plague or string of
STDs. They’re computer viruses
that technicians at Pitt’s Computing
Services and System Development
have battled for the past week.

Fortunately, for students, the
treatment for ailing computers isn’t
difficult or painful. With a» disk
available from CSSD, students can
clean their machines and download
a program, known as a patch, to
protect their computers from get-
ting the same viruses again.

But technicians still face the
problem of getting the disk to stu-
dents before the problems slow
down Pitt’s, network — and con-
vincing students that their comput-
ers might be infected, even if they
don’t encounter any problems.

“If you don’t have
machine patched, at-this point, you
have it,” Jinx Walton, director of
CSSD, said about the virus known
as the Microsoft Blaster Worm,
because -it affects Microsoft win-
dows. ’ -

Technicians in Schenley Quad

.and in- front of the William Pitt

Union handed out the disks and
ﬂiers, alerting students about the
viruses, duringthe student move—in
days last week. According to the
fliers, all students must call 4-
HELP to report when they have
cleaned and patched their comput-
ers. . ,

All students who do not report
that‘ their computers have been

cleaned will lose their Pitt account"

Man in South
Oakland dies

in shooting    

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

A fatal shooting in a house in the
3200 block of Ward Street left one
man dead on Wednesday, August 20
in the early morning.

Donald Love, 31, who was shot
in the head around 1 a.m., was not a
resident in the South Oakland house,
which is on a street populated by col-
lege students and older residents,
about a 10-minute walk from cam-
pus.

No other injuries were reported,
and police believe the death was
drug—related, but they do not have
any suspects at this time,

Pitt and city police responded to
a report of gunshots on the same
block of Ward Street less than a week
earlier, just after 10 p.m. on
Saturday, August 16.

USSA has politically active history

J. ELIZABETH STROHVM
2 News Editor

The United States Student

Association determines its agenda for
the upcoming year at an annual confer-
ence of student members. Many years,
Pitt students attend the conference to
represent the University.
0 This year, however, students’ atten-
dance at the conference has raised con-
troversy —— and led some members of
Student Government Board to question
SGB’s involvement with USSA. SGB
passed a resolution to spend $4,680 to
send four Pitt students to the national
conference at the _University of
Califomia—Riverside. Only two students
attended the conference.

Those members opposed to the
SGB’s involvement would like Pitt’s
student body to resolve the issue by
vote, but many students might be unfa-
miliar with USSA, its history and its
many positions.

In 1946, the International Union of
Students met in Europe to bring repre-
sentatives together on issues that affect
students everywhere.

When American representatives

returned from the conference, they
decided to have a meeting of their own.

The following summer, the National
Student Association, NSA, was formed

to represent students in national issues »

— particularly those concerning stu-
dents. Although some members argued
from the beginning against taking polit-
ical stands, others believed the organiza-
tion should address any political issues
that might affect students.

Through its history, NSA, which
merged with the more radical National
Student Lobby to become the United
States Student Association in 1978, has
condemned McCarthyism, the Vietnam
War and South African apartheid — but
only as it pertained to higher education,
according to the Web site. 2

USSA currently sponsors projects
including the Grassroots Organizing

Weekends; the Student of Color.
' Campus Diversity Project; the Lesbian,

Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Student
Empowerment Project; and the Student-

‘Labor Action Project. A 4
I The organization concentrates its

efforts in three areas, according to the
USSA Web site. The ﬁrst, and perhaps
the most relevant to the majority of stu-

wwW.pittnews.com

dents, encourages welfare and federal
funding for programs that increase edu-
cational access, such as the Pell grant,
high school outreach and support for
students with disabilities. The second
focus seeks to eliminate racial profiling,

both on campuses and in communities.
\ Largely inspired by the 2000 presiden-
tial elections, USSA’s third concentra-

tion seeks electoral reform.

Through lobbying last year, the
group raised the value of Pell grants for
Pitt students by $700,000, according to
USSA regional chair Jen Stephan. She
described the group as “the only organi-
zation that works solely on student
issues in D.C.”

USSA’s mission statement
describes the orgai1’ization’s efforts as
Working to ‘freveal the links between
access to higher education and the
socioeconomic inequalities of our soci-
ety.” The statement also says the group
is “committed to altering the relations of

power and creating long—lasting social

change.” ~’ ,

its history and its mission, students can

dents.org.

cation affects everyone,” said
Stephan, who is also president of
the Campus Women’s Organization.
She explained that USSA works to

' give more people access to higher

education, to decrease loan debt,
and to increase the number and
value of grants. V

Through lobbying last year, the
group raised the value of Pell grants
for Pitt students by $700,000,
Stephan said. 1 »

She described the group as “the
only organization that works solely
on student issues in D.C.”

Morris explained that SGB
members would not be able to work
on USSA-organized, student-cen-
tered events if the groups were not
affiliated.

“If it was an independent orga-
nization, I couldn’t work on ‘Get
Out the Vote,”’ Morris said. “All
students are members of USSA, and
all students can benefit from
USSA.”

Morris also believes that Pitt
must maintain its campus-wide
membership to preserve the repre-
sentation of Pitt students in national
decisions.

“It’s important because it’s stu-
dent-run,” Morris said. “We as stu-
dents decide the national agenda. If
we as students .are not there for that
decision—making, we as Pitt are not
a part of that agenda.”

SGB’s affiliation with USSA
does more than just involve board
members in USSA activities. It also
involves them in giving money from
the student activity fund to pay for
their involvement. '

When a recognized student orga-
nization wants money, a group
leader presents the request before
the Student Government Board
Allocations Committee. The com-
mittee listens to the reasons for the
request, and recommends to SGB
how much, money — if any — the

group should receive.
But the United States Student
Association is not a recognized

campus organization, and though a’

representative of the group must
still go before the Allocations
Committee to request funding, an
SGB member acts as a representa-
tive. L

In the same process as for any
allocations request, the board also
receives Allocations’ recommenda-
tion and makes the final decision 0
how much money to give. A

Though differences might not
seem like many, they’re enough to
lead Morely to suggest eliminating
the connection between USSA and
SGB —— leaving USSA, as an inde-
pendent student organization, to

fend for itself.

“They would never give any
other student organization that type
of money for a conference,” Morely
said, referring tothe $4,680 of stu-

vdentactivity funds the board voted

to give -— against Allocations’ rec-
ommendation — to send four stu-
dents to California for the national
conference. 0

“SGB overrides allocations all
the time, and they’re just not fol-
lowing their own rules,” he added.

The board voted 5-3 in favor of

the funding, with members Morely, '

Peter Stopp and Brian Kelly
opposed to the action. Only two stu-
dents,,Stephan and Morris, actually
attended the conference.

Though SGB‘ president Liz
Culliton agreed that the process
through which USSA requests
money from Allocations could be
improved, she said she has not cho-
sen a side on the particulars.

“They definitely have a different
stance from the College Democrats,
or 4 the College Republicans,”
Culliton said, explaining that USSA
is supposed to represent all students,
unlike student groups that represent
a particular political party or plat-
form.

access until technicians can verify
that their computers are safe,
according to the ﬂiers. As long as
the worm remains in Pitt’s network,
it will eat the bandwidth and
degrade the network, Walton said.
Like a virus, a worm — which
is often considered a kind of virus

—— makes working replicas of itself ‘

to infect more systems. But while a
virus exists only as an attachment
to other files or programs, a worm
is a separate entity. The MS Blaster
Worm exists in networks, so a com-
puter can become infected as soon
as the user logs on to the Internet.
Infected computers will often
shut down within minutes of being
activated, but not all infected com-

puters will display obvious symp-

toms, Walton said.

Less threatening to the network,
but more annoying to those affect-
ed, is the Sobig virus, which can
send hundreds of e—mails to an
account every hour. The virus —— a
true virus, and not a worm — can
travel through an e-mail account to
every person in that user’s address
book. '

“This virus is one of the fastest
e-mail—spreading viruses ever,”
said Walton, adding that, because
the virus is so quick and large, it
may take more than a week to die
down. Similar e-mail transmitted
viruses typically fade in a few days.

The disk containing cleaning
and protection programs for both
viruses is available for free at any
campus computing lab.

Phat Man Dee sings, criticizes Bush

Protest, page 7

afternoon, several people performed
for the group sitting in the park.

Phat Man Dee sang for the group
a collection of classic American songs
—-,with a twist at the end.

’ Dressed all in red, with two patch-
es of hair on the sides of her head,
Phat Man Dee, received applause
from the crowd at the end of her ren-
dition of “What a Wonderful World”
when she sang, “George Bush, in spite
of yourself; I. think to myself, what a
wonderful world.” A

After her song, she criticized the
current administration leaders for
thinking “thou shall not kill” applies

to everyone except them, and for leav-
ing the war in Iraq to be fought by the
poor

“Politicians hide themselves
away,” she said. “They only started
the war -—‘why should they go out and
fight it?”

POG activist and Merton Center
project coordinator Marie Skoczylas
said the day’s events were important
because, “The city is going to hell and
we’re continuing to fund this illegal
occupation.”

Billions of dollars are being
diverted away from important things,
such as the public transportation sys-

tem, police and education, Skoczylas ‘
-added.

Murphy’s not great, but let’s not terminate

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy’s
approval ratings have nose—dived,
largely because of the city’s fiscal cri-
sis, according to a Pennsylvania Poll
of registered Allegheny County vot-
ers. I

This begs the question: Will
Pittsburgh be caught up in recall mad-
ness, the latest fad to drift in from
California?

While no one has suggested that
Pittsburgh elect Gary Coleman mayor
—— yet — it is clear that voters’ dissat-
isfaction with Murphy will affect his
third term. , ‘

But, despite the numbers, there
should be no California-style, ejec-
tion—seat politics.

Seventy-four percent of city vot-
ers said that Murphy does not deserve
to be re—elected, as did 64 percent of
suburban ones. Still, a poll is not a no-
confidence vote, which, under parlia-
mentary systems, can dissolve the rul-
ing party’s government.

Though a recall is as close to a no-
confidence vote as U.S. democracy
provides, it is not one. California’s
potential recall of Governor Gray
Davis is estimated to cost the state $30
million. Clearly, if Pittsburgh is cut-
ting basic services like public trans-
portation, it doesn’t have that kind of
disposable funds —— for that matter,
neither does California. . V

Moreover, Murphy has not been

accused of the malfeasance that would
necessitate a recall. Sure, the
Pittsburgh budget is creeping further
into a deficit chasm. So is nearly
every other city’s and state’s. After
sevenfat years, the city must prepare
for the. lean ones, such as this.
Certainly, succumbing to a national -
and international — trend is not
grounds on which a mayor can be
thrown from office. -
That said, Murphy’s performance
has not been admirable. ‘He has earned

his approval rating or, rather, lack 0
thereof. But that isnot on par with‘

gross’, neglect or criminal activity —
valid reasons for a recall. It should be

‘noted that Davis is not accused of
 these, either.

Popularity oscillates. Murphy was
elected by a landslide —— after beating
his opponent in the primary by a hair.
Two years ago, Pittsburgh voters
wanted . him in office. Times, of
course, have changed. Given this,vari-
ation, it is not prudent to try to abort a

po1itician’s term because his populari-

ty has dropped.

Instead of flushing Murphy,
Pittsburgh voters should concentrate
on drafting a new person to head this
city, and then elect him or her when
Murphy’s term has ended. To do oth-
erwise would be a waste of time and
money, and give the California circus
a legitimacy it doesn’t deserve.

World’s youngest cantankerous oldster

Don’t be fooled by my facade ofyoung
ﬂesh — beneath it, I am a crusty, old troll.

I’ve always been a little crotchety, for
my age. As a toddler, I became. grouchy
when dinner was not served exactly on time.
Except my lack of armpit-reaching, old-man
pants, you couldn’t tell me apart from my
grandpa. I .

At recess, I would scowl when the dam

most of my high school parties because I

was too tired tostay awake. . .
_ But it wasn’t the discovery of a gray 
(senior year of high school) or
my failing eyesight (fourth
grade) that brought on my
most recent sense of crustiness.
It was freshmen. 4

years older than me.

Even if I’ve changed in my years at col-
lege, my attitudes are essentially unchanged.
I rriight notice a prominently‘ displayed

thong clinging above a freshman’s low-rise,

jeans and shake my head while my internal
voice —— my core of crustiness —— mutters
something about “kids, these days.” I prob-
ably would have done the same thing when
I was eight. . "
I’m not totally misanthropic. Whether

‘having dinner with friends or polishing oﬂ’ a

bottle of tequila with‘ a roommate, I enjoy
human contact. And I’m still
fond of going out — in theory.
I’m usually eager to see con-
certs or plays, and some of my
best days have been spent just
anticipating the awesome party
that promised to come with the
evening. -

But mgre and more, I ﬁnd
that I  just as content to curl
up and watch a movie with my

' relished my duties as a weathered sage, dis-

pensing bits of my vast knowledge. ,

This year, I couldn’t think of anything
wise to say._After getting through a diﬂicult
sophomore year, I felt less qualiﬁed to
explain the intricacies of college. Instead, I
just smiledegrimly at the young’uns, who
were all bright, fresh and ready‘ to be

ity at diﬂ’erent points in life. Some ﬁnd it
with regular frequency. I’m not the ﬁrst per-
son to realize that you can’t avoid some of
the morediﬂicult parts of growing up.

I’m not sure if Ikept ‘quiet because I-felt

Monday, K1igust23, 20‘O‘3 I L

Does engineering condemn a man to life without lovin’?

Dear Sex N’at:

So, the general idea I’m getting from
your column is that we’re supposed to be
having sex in college. Myself, I am an
engineer.

Have you been around this building?
There aren’t any girls at all — only those
on our raunchy desktops. How are we
supposed to be meeting these girls when
the only sexually active partner in my life
is Rosy Palm and her ﬁve sisters?

It’s not like I can get out of this place;
I’m always busy. I’m no social butterﬂy
by far, not to mention that any social
opportunity that presents itself does not
allow me to communicate with women
about anything other than academic
issues. ,

The bottom-line question is this:
Where do I go to meet these women," and
when I get there, surely all by myself,

how do I initiate conversation without ‘
giving the geek impression that engineers .

in my area of study always achieve? 2

If you’re good at this, surely you will
have some good advice, rather than,
“Well, you just need to get out more.”
—Homy in Benedum

Dear HIB:

Well, you just need to get out more.

 

Sorry, you walked right into that one.
A few things trouble me about your
question. First, you say that “the general
idea” you’re getting is that you are “sup—
posed to be having sex in college.” Do

— you want to get laid, or do you want to do

what you think you are “supposed” to do?
There’s no gen—ed requirement for
hookups, so if you aren’t get-
ting any and the only thing
wrong with that is what a snot-
ty columnist seems to imply,
you don’t really have a prob-
lem, do you?

And guess what else?
Your peers, for the most part,
are. probably having far less
sex than you might assume +
don’t think Rosy Palm and her
ﬁve sisters aren’t getting
action all day every day, from the booty-
shakinest ' fraternity house /to the A11-

Headgear—and-Body-Odor Floor of c

Tower C.

Then you say the only women in
Benedum are those on your raunchy
desktops, and you ask how you are sup-
posed to be meeting “these girls.” Are
you trying to meetyour desktop goddess?
I’m guessing that’s impossible, unless

. you have shots of random Oakland chicks

— I can’t tell you how to meet Milla

Jovovich, but if anyone can, e-mail me

posthaste.

 

 

Melissa Meinzer
Opinions Editor

,."t--~r-.-~‘-- "¢>3gvv‘$‘v‘-v-r4S5“7‘4‘P'€~‘r"‘fv'>‘.Ic‘ , ,_ ‘  ..

This brings me to another thorn in
your question. I sincerely doubt there are
“no women” in Benedum. I can buy that
most of them don’t look like Milla +
most women don’t — but they do exist.
You may be overlooking perfectly nice
girls because they are, well, geeks.

Don’t underestimate those “geeky”
chicks you deal with on an
academic level. They“ prob-
ably have the same con-
cerns as you, but, alas,
David Beckham doesn’t
hang out at Benedum either.
Just because a girl is bril-
liant and more concerned
with tangents than tan lines,
don’t think she can’t be a
total freak in the sack.
Some of the most sexually

' adventurous women I’ve known have

had bad hair and lame sweatpants. Don’t
write a woman off because she might be
— gasp — smarter than you.

‘I know engineers are busy beavers,‘

but you do leave Benedum occasionally.
Trust me, you do, even if it doesn’t
involve wild nights of doing lines off
strippers’ asses; Do you go to the grocery
store? How ‘bout the Laundromat? All
that nerditude must work up an appetite,
not to mention a sweat. You just need to
be more receptive and more open in your
day-to-day life, in B-land and out. Think

‘of yourself as a sexy beast, on the prowl
at all times.

You are hung up on the “geeky
impression” you think you radiate. To
paraphrase one of the most brilliant
philosophers of our time, Tyler Durden,

you are not your major. Sure, most of the

time you are HIB, Engineering Student,
but you don’t have to be. You have other
attributes besides dorkism. If you think
engineers are all nerds, leave your engi-
neer hat at home or in Benedum whenev-
er you aren’t studying. When you go out,
be HIB, Sex Machine. Or HEB, Sensitive
Emo-Hottie. Or HIB, Dashing » and
Mysterious Guy. Get the idea?

Here’s another thought. You are who
you are, and I’m thinking that’s an intelli-
gent, studious guy who is maybe a little
on the shy and nerdy side; There are
women —_and I’m looking at you, mirror
—— who love a dweeby guy" who can give
them a run for their conversational
money. A

Women are out there. They want to
meet, get to know, and havesexy sex with
guys like you. Just keep your eyes open.
Good luck. V

chological professional, wishes she ’d had
more questions to answer this week.

any question, no matter how ridicu-

put “stupid ques-
tion” in the sub- *
ject line. I’ll do
my best to find and
answer, or at
least a creative
excuse for why I
can ’t find one.

Sadly, the answer is more mun-
dane. According to. Pitt’s Office of
Public Affairs, no one can exactly
remember when the door became
off-limits, but the reason is simple
and twofold: safety and bureaucra-
cy.

Apparently, the concrete tiles,
which so beautifully adorn the plat-
form around the closed door, don’t
handle the cold as well as the intre-

of the Pittsburgh winter, the
droplets in those joints froze, caus-
ing the tiles to “bridge up,” making
the terrain hazardous_to any student
not looking where he or she was
walking.

While it might not seem the
most dangerous of Oakland’s many

hazards, one could easily envision‘
some stumb.1y,,butter-toed freshman’

falling on his face while walking

with the

extreme clumsiness. .
But, you ask, is there an end i
sight? Will we ever be able to use
the entrance as God intended us to?
Yes, says John Fedele of the
Officeof Public Affairs. The reno-
vations removing the treacherous
tiles and joints are scheduled‘ for
some time in “the next few years.”

« Why the vagueness? Hillman is
actually a state-maintained build-
ing, and, there-
fore, needs state
funding to be
freed up before
said renovations
can begin. If

What happened was this: Tiny

students, looked for homes in the,

The Pitt News helps you pick out your digs

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
The Pitt News

I’m looking out for you. And my
hope is that none of you end up with a
black strip over your eyes in the latest
fashion magazine’s section about what
not to wear. With the fall season
approaching, these tips will keep any
guy or girl looking hot.

We’ll use my experience — gained
while attending the
“Justified/Stripped” tour this summer
—— with articles of clothing you
shouldn’t be caught dead in, or ones
that, if you were, someone should dig
you out of your grave and give you a
makeover.

Faux pas No. 1: Wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl uniform if you are over the
age of 18. The only exceptions are for

girls actually attending a Catholic

school, hence the uniform, or appear-
ing in a Britney Spears video. I bowed
my head in shame at the 30-year-old
woman standing in the ticket line.
Fix: Try a rufﬂed or pleated miniskirt.
If you’re not looking to spend several
hundred dollars on Marc Jacobs or
Gucci, Charlotte Russe has some
minis that won’t leave you scrambling
for rent money.

Faux pas No. 2: Wearing a neon
orange, psychedelic ha1ter—top, accom-
panied by a lime green miniskirt with
your go—go boots. Only do this if
you’re planning on auditioning for
Austin Powers 4.

Fix: While the ‘60s look isn’t out,
dressing like an idiot is. The mod look
this autumn is a definite yes. If you’re
staying‘ in this Saturday night, rent
“The Mod Squad” for quick inspira-
tion. Also, remember these three key
words: bright, bold and basic. Ditch
the go—gos but not the boots. They’re a
yes. Any shape, size or color.

Faux pas No. 3: Ladies, undergar-
ments are strictly for under your gar-
ments. Who would have thought? Let
Vicki’s leopard thong remain a secret.
No one wants to see it. And if you’re
wearing leopard, honey, you missed
the bus. Animal print has been extinct
since ’98.

Fix: Zebra and cheetah prints are out,
as is showing your tush. Stay warm
this autumn, in a fitted coat, keeping
your bare essentials covered. Tweed is

hot this fall and will be showing up‘
everywhere. A form-fitting coat tied S

together with a skinny belt is the look.
But while your favorite department
store may not carry Prada or Versace,
they do have close imitations.

Faux pas No. 4: Gentlemen, Joe
Boxer was cool, what, five years ago?
But if you’re going to wear them, or
any type of loincloth, once again,
cover it up. No one wants to sit behind
you in statistics and have to see your
tightie whities — or learn you’ve
decided to take notes commando.

Fix: Buckle your belt one more notch.
One tip, though, and don’t be con-
fused: If your jeans are tighter than
mine, stick ’em back in your drawers
or on the pile of clothes in your room.
And let’s get a little more creative here
— stay away from basic Hanes T-
shirts and jeans. Sporty, zip-up jackets
and cargos are must-haves. To top off
your new style, you won’t be looked
down upon if you borrow from my
man JT. Go with the trucker’s cap -
trust me, they’re in. (Look to
www.urbanoutfitters.com for more
ideas.) ' -

Faux pas No. 5: Girls, if you’re going
to wear a skirt, try wearing one long
enough to cover a cheek. And I’m not
talking about the ones you rub your
rosy blush on. If the skirt“ isn’t big
enough to work as a headband, I high-
ly doubt it’s going to do your butt jus-
tice. ,

Fix: Believe it or not, tights are back.
Noticeable seams and fishnets,

maroons and charcoals are a few pos-
sibilities. Cover your legs in color and
top it off with a sexy, tweed skirt.
Knee—length skirts work with any body
type. This season is all about subtlety,
which, ultimately, is sexier than the
“Pm going home with you tonight”
look. Go for classy, not trashy.

Faux pas No. 6: Do I even need to
bring this to your attention? Ladies
and gentlemen, never pair socks and
sandals together. And if you’re going
to, anyway, at least wear this atrocity
in the privacy of your own home.

Fix: Ladies, pumps are in. Heels or
ﬂats, pointy—toed or rounded, suede or
leather. But while we can’t all afford
Sarah Jessica Parker’s Manolo
Blahniks, a couple nights of working
at the pizza shop can get you some
stylish—l,ooking Nine West or Steve
Madden ones. Guys, just remember:
suede or sneakers with some color.
Boring is a no—no. As always, you can
never go Wrong shopping at Journeys.

These are only a few tips to start
the fall semester off right, with some
style. Just remember to stay away
from leopard and you’ll be ﬁne. I’m
not being mean, I’m just being honest.

After all, I’m only watching out for’

your best interests.

The e I was, only two weeks away
from starting my life as a ﬁeshman at Pitt,
unsure of where college wo11ld lead me and
what I would do with my life afterward.
From a platform above a swimming pool-
sized puddle of mud, three dirt—encrusted

men —— dressed only in coarse, burlap pants ,

held up with rope — shouted out a sentence

that to this day gives me reassurance.
“Welcome to the Mud Show! Behold

the dangers of a liberal arts education!” they

said. And with that they began a portrayal of
Beowulf in mud. I knew my career future
was secure.
ThiswasmyﬁrsttasteoftheGreater
Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival, which
retumed this year to bring people a glimpse

A of life in the 16th century.

When you cross the gates, you enter a
village in the kingdom of Morlandshire.
This day happens to be the day when King
Edward and Queen Rosalind, the monarchs
of the land, will pay this village a visit, and
so a festival is being held in their honor. For
this celebration the Morlandshirelings have
assembled a collection of jugglers, comedi-
ans, magicians, musicians, dancers and a
wide array of other performers to entertain
and awe the royal pair, along with anyone
else who wanders about the festivities.

Strolling the paths and coves of the fes-
tival, you are likely to encounter sights rang-
ing from small skits and plays, such as The
Mud Show, to feats of magic and perform-
ers who put their very lives on the line to
entertain, such as Dai Andrews, who counts
among his talents magic, escapism and
sword swallowing — he’s one of only ﬁve
sword—swallowers to attempt downing a
curved blade. Some shows even encourage
visitor participation, such as the ongoing
Human Chess Match, where you can take
the place of the king or just stand as a lowly
pawn.

Market, a variety of booths and tents where
craftspeople show their skills and sell some

The festival also includes the Craft

of their wares, from bits of jewelry, pottery
or paintings, to weapons and blacksmithing.

The highlights of each day’s festivities
are the competitions and jousting matches
held before the king and queen. The com-
petitors take the ﬁeld three times a day, at l
p.m., 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., each time high-
lighting a dilferent skill, such as riding dur-
ing the Equestrian Games, or displaying
their battle savvy during the last competition
of the day, the Joust to the Death. Spectators
gather around the large ﬁeld to watch as
four knights on horseback charge, hack and
sometimes even underhandedly cheat to
win the day and the eye of the queen.

For those interested in a more speciﬁc
area of medieval and Renaissance life, each
weekend is given a theme that brings its
own special events and activities, such as
Wooing Contests during the opening,
romance—themed weekend, or a variety of
tests and trials during the weekend of the
Peasant Games. English and theater majors
might be more interested in the weekend of
September 13th, when the theme will be
Shakespeare, with an appearance by the
noted bard himself.

The Greater Pittsburgh Renaissance
Festival is located about 45 minutes south-
east of Pittsburgh, in New Stanton, and can
reached by driving, or riding your faithﬁil
steed, down the Pennsylvania Tumpike to
Exit 75. For more detailed directions and

311
Volcano Records
ﬁﬁﬁﬁ

If there is one CD that you must

. buy, provided you haven’t already, it is ‘

the new product from 311: Evolver. 311
has been providing a positive message
and feel—good vibe for a strong 13 years
now, and it’s only getting better.

Evolver may be one of 311’s most
intelligent albums to date. The mem-
bers have an uncarmy ability to use
what they feel and what’s going on
around them —— publicly or privately -
and turn it into a mesmerizing harmony
with a unique style.

The heart and soul of the band is in .

this album, from the lyrics and the
melodies, to Nick Hexum’s smooth
harmonies  S.A. Martinez’s ﬂowing
style and rhymes. The bass guitar,
pounded out by P-Nut, is easily recog-
nizable throughout the album. The
whole package is wrapped up with airy
riffs from Tim Mahoney, and the beats
made so special by the true technician
and master, Chad Sexton, on the drums.

Every song on Evolver is incredi-
ble. Key elements come from tracks
like “Still Dreaming,” “Don”t Dwell,”
“Reconsider Everything,” and probably
the best song on the album,
“Sometimes Jacks Rule the Realm,”
which closes out the album in an eclec-

tic, awe—inspiring way that only 311 ,

could produce.

A 311 don’t sing about hating their
parents or hating their lives; everything
comes from a positive perspective, and
that’s what - makes their music stand
out.

They are currently touring in sup-
port of the new album, and were just in
Pittsburgh this » summer with the
Rolling Rock Town Fair.
Unfortunately, they don’t have any
dates scheduled in Pittsburgh for their
headlining tour, which means only one
thing: road trip. And believe me, the
live show is well worth any dollar
amount and any distance, just like this
album. . '

The Boss shows the Bucs a thing or two about filling PNC Park

PNC Park lives a second life as a
concert venue. Maybe it always had
dreams of living the Mick Jagger
fantasy life. Maybe it was just so
used to having quite a few drunken
people in its belly. ‘Either way, PNC
Park has been reincarnated as a rock
‘n’ rollin’ doppelganger of its former
self. Well, at least every now and
then.

Bruce Springsteen is a cool guy.
In his great insight into, not only
rock and roll, but also being as all-
American -as ‘Chevy pickups, he
decided that he and his E Street band
would play a bunch of baseball stadi-
ums for their 2003 summer tour. On

_August 6, several members of the

Pittsburgh Pirates organization
watched in jealous amazement as
The Boss did" what the sad—sack
Buccos never could: fill PNC Park
with loud, proud people excited to be
there. ‘

As one of those “finally, there’s a
reason to come to PNC Park” atten-
dees, I made my fair. share of
“Springsteen will have more hits
tonight than the Pirates will all sea-
son” jokes and swaggered my way

from overpriced souvenir stand to

overpriced refreshment stand. I’m

from Pittsburgh, so of course" I had .

been to a fistful of Pirates games at
PNC, but the new concert seating
arrangements were foreign to me and
I was definitely taken aback by how
many people actually fit in the place.

After taking.‘ my seat, and, by
that, I mean standing in front of it,
on the then—metalized field grass, I
carefully scanned the sightlines from
my location toward where the out-
field would begin if a baseball game
were being played. Satisfied that I
could see past? the big—permed
women and over-mulleted men, I
questioned the coolness factor of
top of a
retractable, metal groundwork, as
opposed to the grass that lay under-
neath. '

While turf-standing would defi-

 
 

CHOCK our OUK
“MING 9051?.’

  

nitely have been much more fun, I
did have to concede that the Pirates
must maintain the illusion that they
are a professional ball club, and that
requires keeping their playing sur-
face urine- and/or beer-free. That
night, there was little difference
between the two substances.

While Bruce sang about the
“Glory Days” of high school base-
ball pitchers throwin’ the heat, it
became notable to me that all of
Springsteen’s old records were more
ingrained into’ Americana than PNC
Park. But the new stadium did have
one major benefit working for it —
space. Unlike several “classic” base-

ball stadiums, PNC is relatively
roomy, which was very important
for the severely intoxicated soccer
mom turned panty thrower, who
needed the entire aisle to dance
along to “Bobby Jean.”

After thoroughly getting my
rock on, I exited PNC Park that
night, wholly satisfied that PNC
could hold its own among concert
sites. It even beats Heinz Field for
intimacy and Mellon Arena for spa-
ciousness. I guess there actually is
a good reason we financed this sta-
dium.

THE BEST DAMN SPORTS SECTION PERIOD.’

Volleyball looks for a    
return to postseason 

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

The 2003 ‘Pitt volleyball team can be

described by one word: experienced.

The Panthers, who just returned from a
two—week exhibition tour in Eastern Europe,
return six starters from last year’s squad,
including two seniors and two juniors.

“We have everybody, back,” head coach
Chris Beerman said. “We are a veteran team,
and everyone on the roster is experienced at

winning.”

But the lone loss for the Panthers was a big
one. Setter Carrie Norris, the team’s all-time

assist leader, graduated in the spring.

Norris was valued for her leadership as
much as her on-court play, but Beerman says
that there are plenty of players on his veteran
squad that are capable of taking a more vocal

role on the team.

“We’ve got leadership by committee,”
Beerman said. “Between our large junior class

Replacing Norris at setter is junior
Lindsey Macke, who brings little experience
but 18 service aces to the starting lineup.
Junior middle hitter Megan Miller, who is a
preseason All—Big East selection, returns to
the starting lineup after ranking ninth in the
NCAA in hitting percentage in 2002 (.400).

Wendy Hatlestad, the 6-foot-3-inch,
senior outside hitter for the Panthers, was .
named as an All-Big East Honorable E
Mention last season after leading the team
with 3.76 kills per game. Sophomore Megan
McGrane, the Panthers’ versatile libero,
returns for her second year after setting a
school record--with 496 digs in 2002.

Rounding out the starting seven for the,
Panthers are junior outside hitter Gini Ullery,
sophomore middle hitter Madelyn Egan and
senior outside hitter Sarah Rollman.

. Rollman had an opportunity to play
against some of the top teams in Europe in
May, when she was selected by Team USA to
play in the 2003 European Spring Cup.

and our returning seniors, we are loaded with

leadership.”

6 Wendy Hatlestad (No. 6) and Madelyn Egan look to help the P
Panthers improve on last year’s 20-win season. ‘

Athletics director prepared for new challenges

Editor’s note: On July 17th, sports editor
Joe Marchilena sat down with new athlet-
ics director Jeﬁ‘ Long to discuss the future
of the program. The following is a selec-
tion of excerpts of the ﬁrst half of the
interview. .

The Pitt News: What made you want to
come to Pitt?

Jeff Long: We all have goals and aspira-
tions, and I had a goal to be an athletic
director at the Division I level. When the
opportunity presented itself to come to an
institution with the history and tradition
and prestige of the University of
Pittsburgh, 1 just felt it was one I needed
to take a look at. I knew that it was a pres-
tigious institution from my days in the
Big Ten, and I knew that it was a tremen-
dously well-respected educational institu-
tion, and that’s always been important to
me as I’ve worked in intercollegiate ath-
letics. T
When this opportunity came, I saw it
as a real chance to come to an exciting
city, come to a program that was going to

“begin to be reestablished, and I really

thought there was bright future and a

- great upside to the athletic program here.

TPN: How will your experience working
at other schools and other conferences
help Pitt?

JL: I’m very proud of every aspect of col-
legiate athletics I’ve worked in. I feel like
I have an appreciation and understanding
for every area of the department and what
their challenges are.

I think, as the leader of the program,
I can have a direct, firsthand knowledge
of what my staff people are dealing with
in those areas. I think that’s a great asset
to me and I think it’s one of my strengths
—— the fact that I have traveled to a num-
ber of institutions, seen a number of dif-
ferent ways to do things and approach
things, and seen success in a number of
different ways. Every institution is differ-
ent. .

Certainly, I’m a product of my expe-
riences, and I bring those experiences to
the University of Pittsburgh, and now I
have to mold those to this culture, this

environment, this market, and that’s‘

where I think the strength is.

, _ i I I r _
TPN: VV1th the recent success that Pitt has
had, is there any speciﬁc way that you can
continue that success? ' ' is

».]L: There is a lot of building left to do.

We’ve taken care of some great things as
far as facilities and such forbasketball, as
well as football. We have some more
work to do in facilities on our campus for
our total athletic program.

We need to build upon the attendance ~

at football. That is something that we are

focused on. Not just for the fact of putting t

more butts in the seats and generating rev-
enue, but_ enhancing the experience for
our fans and our student athletes. Student
athletes will tell you it makes a difference
when those stands are full and that parti-
san crowd is supporting them.

TPN: What are your plans for trying to

get sports like soccer, track and tennis

back on campus?

JL: Those are all things that we are very
much aware of, and we are very interest-
ed in improving that ‘situation. It is not an

. ideal situation where we have to travel

that far off campus. -

One of the most challenging things is
land, and the opportunity to secure land
and have land in proximity in a city.
We’re going to continue to work with
that, and we’ve identiﬁed that as some-
thing we want to improve, and we’ll put’
our efforts intodoing that. VV1th my new-
ness, I’m not even sure I’m aware of all
the options for the future, but it’s certain-
ly something we’re going to focus on.

TPN: Why should people believe that Pitt
is still a good up—and-coming program?

JL: It starts with the University of
Pittsburgh as an institution. Then it comes
to the progress we’ve made to our facili-
ties, the progress we’ve made in our foot-

,ball and basketball programs. I think

we’re also going to see a lot of progress in
our women’s basketball program, because
[head coach] Agnus Berenato is going to
do a wonderful job for us. I think that our
recent success should be very, very
encouraging to our fans and supporters
that we have here. ' "

Looking back on a summer’s worth of memories

A little less than four months ago, a
ﬁiend and I sat at a local bar, throwing back
a few pitchers of our favorite beverages and
decided that this was going to be the greatest
summer of our lives.

Here I sit, 117 days later, and I have to
admit that I must have been looking at the
summer that lay ahead of me through
extremely thick beer goggles.

Sure, there were some high points, and,
while those peaks of the summer were
incredibly high, the valleys were not far
behind.

But that’s my personal life, which I’m
sure none of you want to hear about, and
since this is the sports section and I am the
sports editor, I’ll share with you my favorite
sports memories ﬁom this summer, along
with some fearless predictions of the semes-
ter to come. '

0 Six years ago, an old high school friend ——
whois aRedSoxfan—andIdiscussed

‘how great it would be if Boston and

Pittsburgh could play each other.

We decided that destiny would put the
two teams in the World Series in 2003, the
year that marked the 100th anniversary of
the ﬁrst Fall Classic, in which both teams
played. .

While the Red Sox might have a chance
to be still playing in late October, the Pirates
are in the midst of their 11th consecutive los-
ing season.

But those crafty schedule makers did
not disappoint

During the ﬁrst week of June, the nov-
elty that is interleague play brought Boston
to PNC Park for a
three—game series ..
against the Pirates. For  
the ﬁrst time since
1903, the two clubs

  

night and saw a.car take a turn just a little too
fast As the driver sped on by, one of his pas-
sengers in the back seat leaned out the win-
dow and yelled “Hey, that’s that guy from
The Pitt News!”

E N A ,5  Everyone in the

 ,. .   .. .. car prgcggd to wavg,
including the driver,
although he stopped

played a game that once herealizedhe was
actually meant some— swerving into the
thing. wrong lane. _

While it would 
have been nice to see  °WhileIdidn’t experi-

the Pirates sweep the

series, seeing these two teams play each

other was an experience I will never forget
And that doesn’t mean I have to give up

hope for 2004. -

- One of the perks of this job — or one of the
downsides, depending on how you look at it
—- is that, sometimes, people recognize that
thepicturethatruns withthiscolurnnis areal
person and will occasionally say hello.

That hello is usually followed by the
person asking me some sports-related ques-
tion, and a discussion occasionally follows.

But there are some times thatthe person
doesn’tactually want to engage in.a conver-
sation but wants to be supportive or some-
thing like that * -

Like the time, a few months ago, when
I happened to be walking home fairly late at

ence it ﬁrst- hand,
Randall Simon’s whacking of a giant
sausage has to go on everyone’s memorable
moments list ,

Since I happened to be in a watering
hole when the incident took place, I initially
thoughtlhadhad afewtoomany to drink

But when it replayed about a thousand
timesthatnightand was allthattheradio sta-
tions could talk about the next morning, I
knew I hadn’t dreamed it

. SiInon’s arrest was pointless. Even the
woman in the costume thought it was funny.

And it’s ridiculous to think that beating
the meat will get you a three—game suspen-
sion, but corking your bat —- also known as
cheating -— will only get you seven.

- My ﬁnal memory comes from this past

evening and was a new and enjoyable expe- _

rience. ,

No, I didn’t have my ﬁrst threesome or
snort a line of coke 011“ of a bar.

I participated in my ﬁrst—ever fantasy
football draft .

Yes, I lost my draft virginity last night,
and, as far as I can teH, it was good. A

I hadn’t really thought much about it
heading into the day, but when I entered the
draft room to see more than a dozen people
huddled over magazines and rosters, drool-
ing over stats, Irealized I might have been in
over my head. ' I -

After I ended up with the 14th out of 14
picks, I didn’t thinkl was in good shape, but
I suppose only time will tell.

- And, ﬁnally, here are few things to look for
over the course of the next four months.

ThePirateswilltradeBrianGiles and
Jason Kendall. It’s inevitable, but hopefully
they willbe able to get more back than just a
jock strap and a bag of peanuts. ‘

Larry Fitzge1ald’s hamstring will bother
him for the remainder of the season. It’s
unfortunate, but. it’s easy to see how this
injury could end up like Antonio _ Bryant’s
ankle problem two years ago. ,

And, at some point this season, Walt .

Harris will refer to Pitt’s offense as “tremen-
dous.” ' s

' Joe Marchilena is the sports editor for The

Pitt News and he wishes you the best of luck
in the coming school year:

New coach lea

RYAN WALKER
STAFF WRHER

One look at Pitt’s women’s soccer team
would change the mind of anyone who still
holds the antiquated belief that girls don’t play
hard. '

The Panthers’ new head coach, Sue—Moy

Chin, has created a competitive atmosphere at I

practice, and it is that type of attitude that she
hopes will lead to success in games.

Although this is Chin’s ﬁrst head coach-
ing job, she has been an assistant with some of
the elite women’s soccer programs in the
country. She spent three years at Notre Dame
and, during her tenure there, the team was the
Big East champion three years in a row, went
to the Final Four twice and made an appear-
ance in the NCAA Championship game in her
ﬁnal season with the team.

From there, Chin went to Duke
University, and came to" Pitt from th
University of Colorado. ’

“The experience that I had at Colorado is
very similar to the one here,” Chin said. “We
went there to rebuild the team and we were
doing that. By the time I left, the team was
headed in theright direction.”

The players are already noticing the impact that Chin
has had on the team. Goalie Jamie Pelusi, who led the Big

OVCI.

“Whenever we’re in practice, it’s_100 percent focus,”

she said. “Even the little things, like tucking your shirt in

extremely long practices, but while you’re there,
you’re just working really hard. The atmosphere
- . around the team is just so much more positive. If we
start messing up, then she’ll jump in there and chal-
‘lenge us.” , ' _'
The intensity level is up and this team seems to
be buying into Chin’s way of doing things.
Sophomore Erin Hills, who was the team’s sec-

the team is only hr the preseason, the-new coaching

I  ' has already had a huge impact on player expectations.

“I think that weare going to do extremely we ,’l
Hills said. “We have a lot of talent coming in, and, if
we put our minds to it, we can deﬁnitely do a lot bet-
ter than last year.” I ’

Last year, the team ﬁnished a dismal 4-15 and
failed to win a single conference game. While Chin
has said that she wants to_ make an appearance, as
well as advance, in the Big East Tournament, she will
gauge the success of the team by more than just wins
and losses. V

“I’m looking for the attitude and the heart and the
desire,” Chin said. “I think, when you don’t have
much success, you get beaten down a little bit and
you lose your competitive edge. So I’m looking for
them to compete every minute of every game and
every practice.” 1 4 ‘
Assisting Chin this season will be Monica Gerardo,
who is a former Washington Freedom forward.

The ﬁrst’-coaching duo hopes they have the team on

 

ond-leading scorer last season, said that, even though '

East, last year, in saves per game, said that there have been
a lot of changes that have taken place since Chin took

when you come rtmning onand off the ﬁeld, every second

Long: BCS needs to be tweaked

Long, page 22

There has been confusion about the
Bowl Championship Series, and with
changes in the Big East, and if it will

.change our participation. It is not; we are

secure. Our football-playing institutions
are assured access to the BCS through
this current contract, which runs through
the 2005 season. At that point, the whole
BCS is open for discussion.

We are certainly a major player and
we are committed to that. As I looked at
this situation, I came from a number of
high-level institutions, and I came to
Pittsburgh to compete at that level and be
at that level. There’s no question in my
mind and no doubt in my mind that
Pittsburgh’s going to remain a major
player in collegiate athletics and th
NCAA’. '

TPN: Would you be in favor of keeping '

the BCS the way it_ is or switching to a
playoff system?

JL: Myposition at this point in time, with
the information I have, I’m not sure that a
playoff is in the best interest of intercolle-
giate athletics. I think there will be some
tweaking to the BCS. I certainly think that
the addition of another BCS game, to pro-
vide a little more access to other institu-
tions in other conferences, I think that will
certainly be discussed. .

There is some discussion about hav-
ing one more game after the bowls. Seed
everybody in bowl games, and then take
two teams after the winners of the bowls
games to another game, and that will be

- discussed. To be honest, I’m not sure how

I feel about that. I think there is going to
be some tweaking of the system. I do not
think we’re at the point where ‘a real play-
off system will be implemented.

TPN: Why do you feel that wouldn’t be
as beneﬁcial as the bowl system?

JL: I don’t like the idea. You have to take
into account that we’re at 85 scholarships
and we have redshirted [players], so we
don’t have a full 85 players to play each
year, which is difﬁcult. If you look at pro-
fessional football, they’re playing 16
games a year and they basically average
81 players on their rosters [during the
course of a season]. Theyhave the advan-
tage , of practice‘ squads and injured
reserves, and they can call up players.
Intercollegiate athletics, we don’t have
that, and, if we’re going now to 12 games,
plus a play-off system, we’re putting real
pressure on our student athletes and the
ability to withstand the pounding and the

pressure and the physical drain of a long

football season. ,

» I don’t know if that’s in their best
interest. I feel strongly about the bowl
system. I think it’s served college football
for a long time very well. I think we are
different than the NFL and I think that’s

‘ part of our uniqueness and that’s why col-

lege football is as strong as it is, because
it’s not professional football. I think
[that], every time we inch towards profes-
sional football, we may be hurting the
college game.

TPN: The NFL doesn’t have to worry
about ﬁnals that time of year, either.

JL: Exactly. You have the whole educa-
tional piece. Finals and, if this play-off

system were to go forward, you’re going A
into the beginning of the next academic '

semester. Some of the most important
time is the beginning of the next term. All
those factors lead me to believe that a
playoff system isn’t in the best interests of
our student athletes and college football.

TPN: VV1th Miami and Virginia Tech still
in the Big East this season, getting a BCS
bowl bid would mean a lot. Would getting
one the following year make it any less
satisfying?

JL: No, I don’t think there’d be any less
shine on that apple. 'Ihat’s a great prize,
and to be a BCS team is an outstanding
accomplishment. Going forward, we’ll
still have a conference — we’ll still have
a group of teams still tiying to get there
and win that BCS berth. By no means do
I think it’s going to be any less signiﬁcant.

 Why did the Big East decide to
wait until after 2005 to begin discussin
expansion? _ '

JL: If you analyze the way conferences
are set up, typically June 30th is the date

that a school needs to notify its confer— A ’

ence that they are going to leave follow-
ing that year, or‘even two years. To be
honest, it wasreally a no—choice, because
once we were past that June 30th deadline

and we knew that  and Virginia,

Tech were leaving the conference, there
was” really nothing we could do sooner
than that because the institutions that we
may be talking to —— well, I actually, I
should rephrasethat — that have been
talking to us about joining us, because
we’ve had a number of institutions
approaching us. We have not gone’ out
and recruited and tried to convince
schools to join us“. They are coming to us,
and that’s a signiﬁcant difference between
the way we’re going about our process as
opposed to the ACC.

At that point, you really have no

’ choice, because the schools, that would be

interested in joining you would have to
pay a fee to get out of their league. Really,
the option was to [begin our process to
look at adding schools for the 2005 sea-
son. I think the misunderstanding was
that it was communicated that we weren’t
going to look at institutions until 2005.
The process is beginning now, we just
don’t have the window of opportunity to

. add someone until the 2005 season.

Pitt returns with an experienced team for 2003

Volleyball, page 22

“She had a great experience in
Europe,” Beerman said. “She had 17
kills and hit for a .400 percentage
against Denmark, and, as a fifth-year
senior, she’s just a great athlete.”

Middle hitters April Puzauskas

and Jessica McDonald will provide

support off the bench. Juniors Abby
Fechhelm and Melissa Whaley round
out Pitt’s large class of 2005, and
sophomore Kim Norris, younger sis-
ter of Carrie, returns for her second
season.

The lone newcomer for the
Panthers is freshman setter Azadeh

Boroumand, a much—touted recruit
from Alberta, Canada.

Boroumand has played for club
teams since 1997, and led the nation-
ally ranked Red Deer Queens
Volleyball club to the 2001 Western
Canada Title.

“She’s a great person,” Beerman
said. “Azadeh is a tough competitor
and is Very charismatic in practice.”

Beerman said that the Panthers,
who finished tied for fourth last sea-
son and narrowly missed out on the
postseason, have one goal: to make
the NCAA Tournament.

Standing in their way is an out-
of—conference schedule that includes

national powerhouses Duke, Texas
A&M and Marquette. But Beerman
says that playing tough opponents
and winning go hand in hand.

“We want to play good teams,
because we want to improve as a

team,” Beerman said. “Our first six.

matches are against potential NCAA-
caliber teams, and that’s going to
help us in December.”

“Miami showed last year that
you can make the NCAA Tournament
without winning the conference. We
have to make the NCAA
Tournament, and a tougher schedule

will put us in a better position to do

that.” 0‘
