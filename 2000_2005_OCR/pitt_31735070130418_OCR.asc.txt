Asbestos removal to close
laundry facilities this week

DAVE HARTMAN

Assistant News Editor

Bruce, Amos and Brackenridge hall residents
may be without laundry facilities for part of this
week, as the University removes asbestos—con-
taining materials from the three dormitories.

Pitt’s housing department held an informal
meeting yesterday in the Support Services Office
Conference room, located below Eddies’ cafete-
ria. The purpose of the meeting was to address
students’ concerns about upcoming asbestos
abatement projects scheduled tobegin today.

According to Pitt Health and Safety official
Larry Keller, a number of Pitt buildings were built
with asbestos—containing materials. Keller said the
government banned the new use of asbestos in the
1970s.

“The University owns a lot of buildings that
were built before 1970 and have asbestos thermal
insulation,” Keller said.

Keller said that the government banned the
material when research determined that it caused
respiratory diseases and cancers. Since that time,
legislation required primary and secondary
schools to get rid of the material. However, public
buildings are not required to remove the asbestos
until the material has deteriorated enough to
become airborne.

Keller said the University’s Operations and

‘ Maintenance Program for Asbestos Containing

Materials is the basis for Pitt’s handling of
asbestos matters. The plan is reviewed yearly by
the Allegheny County Health Department.

The plan allows Pitt to conduct small abate-
ment projects by itself, and provides guidelines
for hiring contractors to conduct the larger
asbestos removal projects.

According to Keller, the University hires one
contracting firm to conduct the abatement, and a

separate firm tests the area for asbestos fibers after p

the abatement. .

“Once the job is finished, there’s a quality
control step where p  a company not involved
with the contractor or owner conducts air sam-
pling,” Keller said. ,

When asked about reports that employees of
two such companies that conducted" asbestos
abatement and testing at Pitt were closely related,
Keller acknowledged that a conﬂict of interest had
existed in the past.

Health department Asbestos Inspector
Supervisor Don Horgan, who also attended the
meeting, said the foreman of one of those compa-
nies and the owner of the other were brothers.
Horgan said that the problem has been taken care
of.

' The Pitt News

Dr. Reuben E. Slesinger, an economics professor at
Pitt for more than a half century, died yesterday morn-
ing after a short illness. He was 84.

Slesinger is remembered as a fixture in the depart-
ment of economics and as a nationally renowned foren-
sic economist. In addition to teaching both undergradu-
ate and graduate students here at Pitt, he also taught
continuing legal education classes -at Pitt and
Duquesne’s law’ schools, as well as a class in forensic
economics at Point Park College.

A retired U.S. Army Colonel and World War II vet-
eran,'he also lectured at the Army War College and the
Armed Services Staff College.  - -  ~   I 

His writings included articles
in the Journal of the American Bar
Association, the European Journal
of Law and Economics and the
Pittsburgh Law Journal in addition.
to his most recent book, 1995’si
fourth edition of “The Economic
Way of Thinking.”

The United States Justice
Department, the Federal Power
Commission and a number of pri-
vate companies used him as a con-
sultant for his work on forensic
economics during his career.

Slesinger began his Pitt career in the 1930s, receiv-
ing a bachelor of science degree in 1936, a master’s
degree in 1938 and a doctorate in 1940. Although offi-
cially retired in 1986, he maintained a regular class
schedule until last week. In the intervening years, he
taught economics to more than 60,000 students. Most
remembered him as an excellent and helpful teacher.

“More than any other faculty member that I have
ever known, Reuben Slesinger was beloved by his stu-
dents,” recalled former associate dean and department
chair Frank Giarranti. “He had a rare gift.”

“Whenever people think about economics at Pitt,
they think of Reuben Slesinger,” said economics profes-
sor Herbert Chesler. “Perhaps it is because his creed was
‘Students don’t fail. Only teachers fail.”’

According to Steve Lehrer, an economics graduate
student, Slesinger was never one of those teachers.

“I probably never met someone in a research univer-
sity with such a strong commitment to undergraduate
teaching,” Lehrer said. “He was a good guy.”

“When I meet a former Pitt student, I first ask if they
had been a Reuben Slesinger student,” said former stu-
dent Robert Sinclair. “I’m amazed by how many had
been and remembered him. I think Dr. Slesinger pro-
vides us all with an example of how to live.” V

Pitt Athletic Director Steve Pederson said he will
remember Slesinger as a great man.

“In the brief time that I knew Reuben, he was a great

Pitt trick-or-tre aters’

hit the   streets tonight

LESLIE HOFFMAN

Senior Staff Writer

Get your Batman pajamas out of
storage. Some Pitt students will be
celebrating Halloween in costume

.~,.t9n-ight as-they canvass the streets of
"North Oakland

.Pitt ‘freshmen Jason Knauf,

. Amber Herczeg and Sarah Wexler
,-_.have all decidedto continue the
I annual trick or treat tradition by
 ‘trick or treating tonight.

Dressed up like members of the
Scooby Doo gang, they plan to join

1 the ranks of Pittsburgh’s younger
"ghouls and goblins as they canvass
 North Oakland homes. A

According to Wexler, the group

_ was originally going.to include the

entire Scooby Doo gang: Daphne,
Velma, Shaggy, Fred and Scooby
Doo. Now they only have ‘a Daphne’
(Wexler), Velma (Herczeg) and
Shaggy (Knauf). _ _
Because they lack a “Scooby,”
the trick or treaters are going as
“Scooby Dooby Doo, Where Are
You?” and plan to tote a box of
Scooby Snacks in lieu of a Scooby.

 . ‘.‘We figure if we don’t have a
Scooby, that’s about all we can do,”‘

Wexler said. _
The three compiled their ‘70s-

style costumes from the Oakland-

vintage store Crimes of Fashion as
well as’ from their own wardrobes.

A They said they would probably still
 be working on constructing their
V Costumes today.

Wexler said she hopes their cos-

htumes will be perfect by the time

trick or treating begins tonight.

“Otherwise, we’re not going to
get much candy,” she said.

Wexler estimates that three will
haul in “one to two pillowcases full”
of candy from the night.

Knauf said he has a different

motive.
“We don’t care if we get any

_ candy or not. We just want to walk

around in costumes,” he said.

Wexler said that any candy the
group gets probably won’t last very
long. '

‘‘We’ll probably share it with
other students,” she said, adding that
the candy will take the place of on-
campus food for at least a few days.

Wexler said she didn’t see any-
thing wrong with collegiate trick or
treating- '

“I think there are a lot. -more
destructive things we could be doing
on Halloween ‘other than getting free
candy. I figure we should cash in
while we can,” she said.

The Pitt police said that they
didn.’t expect any‘ problems from
college students trick or treating

because they don’t expect many col— '

lege students to do it.

But Wexler, Knauf and Herczeg
won’t be alone in their quest for
candy.

Resident Assistant Susan Uhl
said that students in Tower B plan
on trick or treating in the building
tonight. ’ '

Half of the building will trick or
treat from 9:30 to 10 p.m., and the

other half will trick or treat between »

10:15 and 10:45 p.m.

No costumes are required, but
Uhl said that if students want to
trick or treat, they also have to hand
out candy. The event is open only to
residents of Tower B.

“I’m not sure what the demand
will be .. all the residents on my
ﬂoor are just pretty excited with the
prospect of Halloween in general,”
Uhl said. i »

Students interested in trick or
treating off’ campus can join the
ranks of the costumed from 5 to 8
p.m., Pittsburgh’s official hours for
trick or treat.

. removed from a University building

when it is damaged, when a renovation
that would disrupt asbestos fibers is
planned, or when an emergency repair
is necessary-. The abatements scheduled
this week are to repair water valves that
recently began leaking. '
Keller said that any time Pitt stu-

_dents or employees believe an

asbestos—containing material has been
damaged, they should notify the hous-
ing department immediately. He said
the housing department will then col-
lect a sample of the material to deter-
mine whether or not it is asbestos. If the
test results are positive, steps will be
taken to prevent further damage or
exposure. . ’ -
According to the Operations and
Maintenance Program, when the
University decides an abatement is nec-
essary, it must notify all building work-
ers, contractors and occupants of the
work. In the past, this notification
involved posting the required signs in
the area where work is being done.
Housing department zone coordi-
nator Ron Markovich said Pitt will now

‘notify all students with an abatement

bulletin, which will be placed under
students’ doors.
“Every occupant in the building

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2000 y

will be notiﬁed of any repairs that
housing is going to make unless we’re
talking about an emergency situation,”
Markovich said.

Keller said he isn’t aware of any
other projects scheduled in the next few
months that will require abatements.

'When questioned about reports of a
large—scale abatement project in the
sub-basement of Schenley Quad, he
affirmed that all of the asbestos in that
area is currently being removed by an
outside contractor. _

. Pitt senior Jen Anthony attended
the meeting because of concerns sur-
rounding her sorority’s renovation pro-
jects in Amos Hall. Anthony said that
she‘ and the other. women living in
Amos do their own renovation work;
from painting and wallpapering to
improvements to kitchen cabinets and
floors. V
“Is there -concern for us working
around that?” she asked. “I know our
walls crumble the second we put a nail
into them —— they’re very fragile.”

Markovich suggested ‘that V the
sorority provide the housing depart-
ment with dates during which they plan
to renovate. V '

“You should let housing know what
yOu’re going to do so that we could do
some testing‘ to find out if there is
asbestos,” he said.

“The bottom line here is to assure
you that we don’t believe that  any-
one on campus  is at risk because of
any of these activities,” Keller said.

Celebrate Halloween with
  creative trick or treating

Halloween is easy to forget about
when it does not fall on a weekend.
After a Friday and Saturday spent par-
tying in the guise of a ghost/toga-clad
person/Catholic school girl/drag
queen/other cheesy costume, many stu-
dents are bumt out on Halloween fun,
too tired to recognize the day itself.

Push yourself this year. There are
inﬁnite ways to expand the magic of

the holiday from the weekend through
Oct. 31. _ .
Pleasantly enough, most

Halloween celebrations involve food irt
sonre capacity. To start, you can carve a
pumpkin and bake the seeds with some
salt and savory seasonings. If you lack
the motivation to carry through with
this, just make yourself a jack-o’-
lantern anyway and have fun throwing
the pumpkin innards at your friends.
Apples can be used in a number of
Halloween-y ways — you can bob for
them or cover them with caramel for an
extremely tasty treat. If apples are too
healthy for your taste, then pop up
some buttery popcorn and throw your
favorite horror classics in the VCR.
The most obvious and ftm form of
Halloween-related edible pleasure,
though, is trick or treating. You have a
lot of options here. Trick or treating in
its most basic form involves knocking
on your neighbors’ doors and asking
for candy, which should be amusing if

your neighbors are fellow college stu-
dents. This segment of the population
tends to be low on food; you’re more
likely to end up with moldy unwanted
leftovers than scrumptious treats. '

Therefore, you might have -more
f_un with the reverse version — put on a
costume, buy some candy, knock on
people’s doors and offer them food
instead of asking for it. You can make
people smile by doing this to whornev-
er you come in contact with during the
course of your day — employees in
stores and restaurants, cafeteria work-
ers, security guards in residence halls,
classmates and professors.

It is regrettable that Pitt does not do
more to promote trick or treating. A
trick or treating extravaganza run by
student groups in the Wrlliarn Pitt
Union would be enjoyed by all.

For example, the study abroad
ofﬁce could distribute yummy candy
from around the world; the career ser-
vices people could hand out jobs and
the Student Govemment Board could
go off to work with a hi—ho as Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Don’t let this day pass by uncele-
brated. At the very least, buy yourself a
bag of mini specially-wrapped pack-
ages of Skittles and get one of your
friends to buy some Milk Duds, then
trade your candy back and forth and
devour it until your tunrrny aches. ‘

Liberal Democrats are extinct

In an attempt to secure his left ﬂank ﬁom a
united and burgeoning Green Party, Democratic
presidential nominee Al Gore has adopted a
brand of rhetoric that is populist in form but not in

substance. His record as a centrist is solid and his

self-imposed disassociation with President Bill
Clinton is a tactical maneuver, ‘not one of ideo-
logicalseparation. Gore’s run-for the presidency,

if successful, will be the death of liberalism,.notg

JEFF’

its deﬁning moment. ‘ '
Take, for instance, the abandon-
ment of national health insurance by

once steadfast liberal Democrat,
House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, recently stated, . “The Clinton plan
failed because it was too big and too scary.” Too
big and too scary for conservatives, perhaps, but
it certainly was not a socialized medicine model
so feared in light of the problems facing such
structures erected in Great Britain and France.

The current position of the Democratic
Party is to work toward coverage of all citizens by
a piecemeal approach. The plan would include
increased regulation of HMOs and insurance
providers and more tax breaks designed to relieve
the burden of rising insurance premiums.

Gov. George W. Bush responded to a
question of his position on a theoretical national-
ized health insurance policy during the third and,
ﬁnal presidential debate. He said that he opposed
such a policy because it would take medical deci-

sion-rnaking authority out of the hands of doctors '

and other health care professionals and put it
under the control of government bureaucrats.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

A nationalized health insurance plan, as
proposed by Clinton in 1992 and the Green Party
in this year’s election, would only take over the
insurance and HMO industries,~not the medical
profession itself. Doctors would be free to make
decisions concerning their patients’ care, and such
care would be provided at the expense of the gov-
ernment This differs from the current system,
under which doctors must ﬁght with a proﬁt-
motivated insurance industry to provide the care
they deem necessary for their patients.

What did Gore say when the question

RTURRAY

 

bounced to him in the debates?

He initially agreed with Bush’s statements, ~

then went off on a rant about piecemeal irnple—
mentation by such means as government tax
credits forheathcarecosts——asifthecurrenttax

code isn’t complicated enough. Gore proposes so

many exceptions and rules to the tax code that
apparently, while lost in that vast sea of confu-
sion, he fails to realize that the bureaucracy
required to work through such a
complicated tax code would be as
great ifnot greater than the one that
would be created with a one-sho
National Insurance Plan. » '
Another troubling issue for lib-
erals in this election is the possibility of several
seats opening ‘on the Supreme Court. It is with
this issue that the ever-defensive Democrats try to
persuade potential and current Green Party sup-
porters to hop aboard the Gore bandwagon. Their
arguments are based on fears emanating ﬁom
Bush’s commitment to appointing strict construc-
tionist justices in the mold of Justices Anton
Scalia and Clarence Thomas, whose views are at
odds with liberals’ interpretation of the
Constitution as a living and malleable document.
If,Bush has his way, it is conceivable that

' Roe vs. Wade could be overturned, and federal
regulations designed for enviromnental protec-

tion could be blocked for being violations of indi-
vidual state rights. ’ f

Democrats always fail to point out that Gore
voted to appoint Scalia and Democratic vice-
presidential candidate Joe Lieberman endorsed
the nomination of Thomas. Bush has only
promised to nominate justices in the Scalia-
Thomas mold, whereas the Democratic presiden-
tial and vice—presidential candidates have actively
taken part in creating that mold. _

Throw in Gore’s abandonment of lahor’s
opposition to the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the World Trade Organization,
and itis quiteclearthathewillnothaveaneasy

als that voting Democratic is much different than

The Church of Shakespeare: Join now! 

Readers of my past columns have prob-
ably ﬁgured out ‘by now that I‘ am fascinated
by new or unusual religions.

I’m sure those of you who heard of the
Universal Life Church, the Church of

\ Leonardo DiCaprio, the Church of
Euthanasia and other sects in
my columns may have won-
dered, “Why doesn’t Mike
just take his hobby to a new
level and invent his own new
religion?” .

Well, that time has come, as I would like
to unveil my own experiment in religious
freedom: the Church of Shakespeare.

The Church of Shakespeare (or CoSh)
has only one doctrine: “The literary works of

William Shakespeare are a source of wis—_

dom, beauty and joy.”

That’s it ——-I don’t claim that the Bard is
the only source of these things, or even the
best source of these things. Nor do I claim
any sort of divine status for him (although if
individual members want ‘to actually wor-
ship Shakespeare, they are welcome to do
so).

The CoSh has no commandments,
either. There are no restrictions on diet, dress
or other aspects of your lifestyle. There are
no requirements_ to send money or attend
meetings. Every “Religious Shakespearean”
(Shakespeareologist?
Shakespeareosophist?) may live his or her
religion in any way she or he sees ﬁt.

One individual practitioner may recite
one of the Bard’s sonnets every morning

upon waking. Perhaps another will perform
volunteer service at a local theater which
promotes the works of Shakespeare.

Local congregations might put together
a Shakespeare ﬁlm festival or publish a
Shakespearean journal. Perhaps they could
organize pilgrirnages to various “shrines,”
such as the Folger Shakespeare Library
(www.folger.edu/welcome.htrn) in
Washington, D.C.

The Church of Shakespeare, unlike

some other religions, does not require you to
repudiate your membership in any other
church. You can be part of the CoSh and
continue to be a loyal Roman Catholic,
Muslim, Jew, Lutheran or VV1ccan. Atheists
and agnostics, whether “churched” or
“unchurched,” are sirrrilarly welcome.

The CoSh does not discriminate on the
basis of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orien-
tation, veteran status, nationality, theological
inclination or other any consideration. As
long as you either love Shakespeare or want
to leam more about him, nothing else mat-
ters.

Of course, you may be saying to your- -

self, “That ‘sounds great, Mike, but why
Shakespeare? Why build a religion around
him?”.

I think the answer to that is obvious —
since the Bard began writing his-works in
Elizabethan England, he has become,
arguably, the most popular writer in the his-
tory of human literature. '

But he’s more than a great writer;

 

Shakespeare is also universally acknowl-
edged for his peerless grasp of the human
condition — that is why his plays and poet-
ry are beloved in every culture across the
globe.

From the Albanians to the Zulus, every

culture has found itself

MICHAEL J, enriched by the works of the
M Bard. And the success of such
AZZA recent ﬁlms as John Madden’s

STAFF WRITER “Shakespeare in Love”
demonstrate his continuing

relevance in popular culture. V
The CoSh, despite being a “new” reli-
gion, springs into existence with an honor-
able 400—year history. It has a collection of
authoritative texts — “scriptures,” if you pre-

fer the term — that have stood the test of
time. How many “new” religions can claim
that?

Some might be opposed to my venture
in religion. I am chastened by the words of
Aldous Huxley, who denounced
“Shakespeareolaters” in his 1933 essay
“I-Iamlet‘ in Russia” Huxley wrote, “No
book gains by being styled sacred, and the
attempt to turn Shakespeare’s plays into a
kind of bible of literary perfection is only
harmful.”

I think that Huxley’s concerns are legit-
imate. I am totally opposed to a rigid, author-
itarian, exclusivist approach to the works of

Shakespeare. I hope that the principles that I '

have stated above will prevent the CoSh

from degenerating into an oppressive, nar-
row-minded perversion of what it should be.

So, I invite you to join the CoSh today!
It’s easy; all you have to do is say that you’re
a member. If you want, you can notify me of
your decision at mjrr1st70+@pitt.edu. But
it’s not necessary.

So, fellow Shakespeareans, I invite you
to read a sonnet, to visit a Shakespeare Web
site or to rent a Shakespeare video. If you
think up some imaginative way by which to
practice our new religion, let the rest of us
know about it. The Church of Shakespeare
will be what you make it.

Mike Mazza encourages each of you to cre-
ate your own new religion

KRISTY GRAVER

The Pitt News

Pittsburghhas a long and proud her-
itage rich in cultural and historical signiﬁ-
cance. George Washington utilized our
three rivers to win the French and Indian
War. The world’s first movie theater
opened Downtown on Smithﬁeld Street.

Food fads such as the Clark Bar,
chipped ham, Heinz Ketchup and the
Klondike bar were titillating the taste buds
of yinzers long before the rest of the world

even got a whiff. Pop—cu1ture icons Andy f
Warhol, Gene Kelly, Sharon Stone and _

Mister Rogers are all native ‘Burghers’.

And the Steelers created an unprecedented A
Z ment gone horribly awry. The zombie epi-

football dynasty in the late ‘70s, winning
four Super Bowls in ﬁve years.

Yet, there remains one little-known
fact about the “Steel City” that overshad-
ows all of the other historical references

mentioned. Pittsburgli, my friends, is the

Zombie‘Capital of the World! . ‘*-

‘: ..... (

Yes, long before the city was national- 0 W

ly recognized for its health care system, it
teemed with the ﬂesh-eating, re—animated
corpses of the undead. Radio and televi-
sion stations frantically informed audi-
ences of the mayhem, warning, “Every
dead body that is not exterminated
becomes one of them — it gets up and
kills. The people it kills get up and kill!”

The bloodthirsty zombies reeked
havoc on the city, lumbering through the
desolate streets like drunken freshmen
stumbling home from a South Oakland
keg party.

Explanations for this gruesome phe-
nomenon were not rooted in voodoo or
witchcraft, an elaborate government
scheme or high school" chemistry experi-

dernic that ravaged Pittsburgh in 1968 was

-startedshy a Carnegie Mellon_:University I

dropout named George Romero:

- =j>.Rome_r'o,'.} his_;-fellow college -out-..
casts, de§:id_ed__to  their half-assed
ﬁlm school educations ..and make a full, . _

feature-length
movie that
reﬂected the
social turbulence
and political
upheaval of the
revolutionary

‘60s; a tongue-
in-cheek look at
the American
psyche. And
what better,
more satirical
way to capture
the essence and
crusading spirit
of the ‘love gen-
eration’ then
with a cast of rot-
ting, brain—dead
ghouls.

Filming for
“Night of the
Living Dead”
started in the
summer of 1968
at the con-
derrmed Gass
family farm-
house in Evans
City, Pa., just 30
miles north of

Pittsburgh. The premise, based on a short
story written by Romero, was simple: a
bunch of hungry, ill-tempered corpses rise
from their graves (apparently due to some
intergalactic radiation) and try to inﬁltrate
a farmhouse occupied by a ragtag assort-
ment of Zombieland refugees.

Production costs were a paltry
$140,000. There were no special effects
(chocolate syrup was used for blood), and
there were no big-name actors. The cast
was comprised mostly of Romero’s
friends, curious locals and strategically-
placed mannequins.

This shoestring, black-and—white pro-
duction about a cannibalistic smorgasbord
became an instant classic and opened the
door for more gratuitously gruesome
Hollywood horror ﬂicks.

Ten years later, Romero continued his
ironic look at the human condition with the
release of “Dawn of the Dead,” a campy,
cornic-book style gore-fest ﬁlmed on loca-
tion at Monroeville Mall. “Dawn of the
Dea ” is a highly comical, blood-and-guts

extravaganza, complete with gun—toting V

Puerto Rican militants, a creepy one-
legged priest, a renegade biker gang,
dozens of Iron-City—Beer-drinking zombie
hunters, kung fu ﬁghting, and an army of

marauding ﬂesh—eaters (including a Hare
Krishna, a nun and, if you watch closely, a
Pitt student).

Thanks to the special effects wizardry
of Pittsburgh-based makeup artist Tom
Savini, “Dawn of the Dead” offers some of
the most original, stomach-churning death
scenes in Hollywood history. Zombies are
pulverized by Mack trucks, peppered with
machine gunﬁre, decapitated by helicopter
blades, bludgeoned with machetes, disem-
boweled, dismembered and set ablaze -
all within the span of two hours!

Romero continued the Pittsburgh
bloodbath tradition in “Day of the Dead,”
“Creepshow,” “Monkey Shines,” “Night
of the Living Dead (the remake),” and
“The Dark Half.” The sick and twisted
mind of one CMU misﬁt. .has transformed
this blue—collar steel town into the
Hollywood of the horror genre and added
a quirky page to the annals of Pittsburgh’s
heritage.

Romero claims, “When there’s no
more room in Hell, the dead will walk the
Earth.” Fear not, Pittsburgh! Even if the
blazing inferno is bursting at the seams
with devils, demons and ‘N Sync devotees,
we can all take comfort in knowing that the
gateway to Hell opens up in Cleveland.

LESLIE HOFFMAN

Staff Writer

Oct. 31 is the best day of the year
to listen to Elliott _Smith’s music. So
Pittsburghers are extra lucky because
not only is’ Smith coming to
Pittsburgh, he’s coming tonight.

Smith’s music is perfect October
music; it embodies the turning point
of fall, that last day before the cold
winter sta:rts.'to take hold. ‘ -

Doleful and plaintive, Smith’s
music is the perfect soundtrack for
walking home late at night through
drifts of fallen autumn leaves that a
cold fall rain has brushed off the trees.
His music encapsulates that moment

of walking into a warm building and

looking out at the cold, dark night and
knowing safety and comfort are close
by. - '
Smith’s music, difficult to classi-
fy.in one specific genre, proclaims its
independence, never relying solely on
one instrument and often blending
strings and electric guitar, or electric

guitar and piano, or a tasty melange of
orchestral instruments combined to

form a wholly new and unique sound.

His music is that of the tortured,
artistic loner you loved in high
school; the one you always wanted to
go up to and say, “Hey, I know just
what you’re feeling,” even though
you knew you could
never truly under-
stand him.

Smith’s
lyrics are the
love poetry
the brooding
artistic‘ soul
would send to
you if you ever
had the courage to‘
approach him and

feelings.

“Say Yes,” from
either/or, and fea-
tured on the “Good
Will Hunting sound-
track,”, is a good
example of these
lovely, hopeful, yet
slightly sad lyrics.

Smith proclaims,
“I’m in love with the
world through the"
eyes of a girl/Who’s
still around the
morning after/We

ago and I grew up I

  
 
  
  
  
  
  

didn’t know/I’d be around the morn-
ing after.”

His clear, melancholyvoice com-
bined with the lonely lyrics makes the
listener wish they were that girl he’s
singing about.

Despite Smith’s independent
musical style, his music often brings
to mind folk inﬂuences like Simon
and Garfunkel, and even the
Beatles.

Listening to his newer
' albums, like Figure 8, the lis-

tener can even hear him refer-
L encing his own music.

the opening of “The Easy Way Out,”
from Figure 8 brings to mind that of
“Pitseleh,” on X0. '

Still, Smith’s music is at times so
wholly beautiful it is difficult to criti-

-cize him.

Smith’s pure and intense music
and lyrics pluck chords at the seat of
emotion, and like all truly good
music, the listener feels what he has

STEPHANIE TYREE

Staff Writer

I have a confession to
make. And though I
know it will forev-
er place -me
among the tragi-
cally unhip of Pitt,

   
  
  
 

the solo release, Sailing to
Philadelphia, by Dire Straits guitarist
and frontman Mark Knopﬂer.

Yes, that’s right, Dire Straits. You
may recall them as the band that sang
the “That’s the way you do it/Money
for nothing and chicks for free” song.
That is the infamous early 1980s
music video that features some very
basic computer animation of two
movers, well, moving stuff.

Though my elaborate description
may not be helpful in recalling the
video, I promise that if anyone who
watched MTV growing up as a child
heard the song, they would remember
it.

Regardless, the point is that this is
a band that invariably one that your
parents enjoy and that it is decidedly
not your standard fare of college
music. And yet, here I am, very much
a college student, who finds this
album not ‘painful to listen to and

. , . . . .

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2000

even, amazingly enough, ‘enjoyable.

' Sailing to Philadelphia is not a
stellar album — it does have its
moments of trite pop. Overall,
though, there is a distinct lack of

commercial appeal to this album. It"

has a prevailing feeling of folk to it.
This is especially apparent in the the
single “What It Is” (are those fiddles I
heard in the background?) and

’ ‘‘Baloney Again,” which begins with

a bar of melancholy harmonica.
Mark Knopﬂer has some of ‘the
most interesting vocal qualities I have
heard in a musician. .Even when

he’s singing about
shooting up in
“Junkie Doll,”

has that folky,
 laid—back sense
to it.
The
mentation of this album is
not extraordinary, yet, I could not
help enjoying the extended guitar
solos of “Junkie Doll” and “Sailing to
Philadelphia.” There is bluesy tone to
the solos. p’ '
Knopfler has been called the
greatest guitarist to come out of
England since Eric Clapton. Though

this may be a stretch, his talents make _

one think that it is not altogether
unlikely that some people could
believe this. _

I don’t expect to ever hear this

. album on WPTS, or any station aimed

at people younger than 30. And I
probably couldn’t even defend it
against attacks from the musically
“hip.” It’ll never be near the Aphex
Twin or Radiohead discs in my CD
collection. But I think I’ll keep it, and
I’ll listen to it whenever I need a dose
of folk, blues, and 60 minutes of
extended uncoolness.

Corey Layman is the singer/gui-
tarist for Hovland, one of Pittsburgh’s
more distinct bands. Playing dense,
textured songs that combine complex
guitar work, odd time signatures and
pop melodies, the band has been mak-
ing a name for themselves in the past
few years opening for bands like
Lenola, Joel Phelps, Bablicon and
Idaho. Most recently, they released a
7-inch record on Hope Records, a
local label dedicated to the idea of uni-
fying the Pittsburgh music scene. The
release party for the record will be
Saturday Nov. 4 at the Mr. Roboto in
Wilkinsburg and will feature Teddy

The Pitt News: So, I guess the ﬁrst
thing would be to talk about the new 7-

Corey Layman: Well, we put together
material for a full album at +/- studios,
and then Hope Records wanted to put
out a 7-inch, so we took a main song
from the album and used that as the A
side. Hope might actually release the
full album sometime.

TPN: Personally, I ’ve always assumed
that your songwriting came out of a
very Polvo/Seam tradition, and others
have noted that there are definite Hurl
references in your music; is that an

 

accurate reading?

Layman: Before I moved to
Pittsburgh I mostly listened to Polvo,
but _the background for Hovland most-
ly comes out of the slow-core tradition
with bands like Low, The Red House
Painters and Idaho. We got away from

the slow stuff, but kept the texture and

complex themes that are in their songs.
But, I’m definitely inﬂuenced by Hurl,
Seam, Karl Hendricks and Silkworm.

TPN: What kind of subject matter do
you use for the lyrics? I ’ve noticed a
more reality-based approach to your
lyric writing, especially in songs like

to put out the highest quality stuff. It’s
going to be a long hard road, but they
can pull it off.

goes, that was about the not-worth-

Don Cab left.

TPN: Do you think that attitude is
starting to turn around with clubs like
Mr. Roboto and with Hope Records
and their mission to unite the scene?
Layman: Hope is a big step along the
same lines as things like Roboto, +/-,
The 31st Street Pub, Rickety and
Manny [T heiner]. Things have been
looking better in the last year with
Sonnyboy Productions [who book a lot

Walt Harris walked into his‘

weekly press conference yesterday
with the excitement of a well-played
game against Virginia Tech, but the
agony of another tough last-second
loss. ‘

“We had a tremendous battle
against Virginia Tech,” Harris said.
“We gave them everything we had
to give. Unfortunately it wasn’t
quite enough. We are excited that
we have the ability to play top
teams. We just have to learn how to
finish games.”-

Harris was talking about the 37-
34 loss on Saturday to No. 2
Virginia Tech, This marks the sec-
ond time in three games that Pitt has
failed to get over that imaginary
hump, that one big game that will

make Pitt a recognized football

team. This week Pitt will face

another team in a similar situation.
“The University of North

Carolina can’t get over that hump

A like us,” Harris said. “You are going

to see two hungry teams out there
on Saturday.”

However, that was all Harris got
to say about the upcoming game

  
 

against North Carolina at 6:30 pm.’
in Three Rivers Stadium. Instead,
the members of the media bombard-
ed Harris with questions about the
loss to Tech. _ _

First, Harris spoke about the
injury to free safety Ramon Walker,
an All-Big East selection as a fresh-
man last year. ‘fRamon is an all-
conference player and one of our
best football players,” Harris said.
“Corey Humphries, who came in for
him, we thought did a good job as
well.” 

“Ramon is a special player for
us. I don’t think we had a big drop-
off in terms of execution, but we
lost one of our special players, so
there had to be some effect,” he
said. _ -

Walker was lost in the first half
of the game on Saturday and is list-
ed as out on the injury report for
this week’s game with North
Carolina. ’

“Ramon’s injury hurt us,” said
defensive end Bryan Knight. “He is
the heart and soul of our defense.”

Going into last week’s game
against Virginia Tech, the game plan
was to devote more time to the pass-
ing game than the rushing attack.

While the Big East Conference has been

Pitt’s volleyball team added two
games to the win column this week,
clawing its way closer to the covet-
ed NCAA tournament.

The weekend matchups with
Georgetown on Saturday and
Villanova on Sunday resulted in
wins for the Panthers, who still sit
in the No. 2 spot in the Big East.

The Panthersfnow 6-2 in the
Big East, are tied for second with
Rutgers. Undefeated Notre Dame
sits in first place.

This weekend’s action left the 7

team with three games to play in the
regular season.

The team will vie for a spot in
the Big East tournament in mid-
November as one of the four top
teams in the conference.

“We have got three games left.
We have got to take them one game
at a time,’,’ said head coach Chris
Beerman.

This weekend’s matches against
Georgetown and Villanova both
resulted in four—game wins. The
victories extended Pitt’s winning
streak to four games.

Pitt vs. Georgetown

Pitt lost to Georgetown last year
but had few problems containing
the Hoyas this time around.

The first game of the match
went to the Panthers, 15-13. The
Panthers then won another game
15-9 before losing the third game 9-
15. Pitt put the match away in the

fourth game, winning 15-5.

Stacy Renick, Marcia Thiesen
and Wendy Hatlestad led the team
offensively, with Renick and
Thiesen racking up 18 kills each
and Hatlestad putting down 11;

will truly be tested next weekend
when they travel to Tennessee‘ to
take on the first—place Titans. In
order for the Steelers to be a com-
petitive force, they are certainly

going to need to find some ‘steady
A offense.

A steady offense was something
the New Jersey Devils had Saturday
night, as they beat the Penguins 9-0,
handing Pittsburgh its worst home
loss in franchise history. _

It was the team’s first sellout
crowd of -the season, as well as the
night the Pens unveiled their new

alternate ‘jerseys. Apparently there-

was something about those jerseys
that made the Pens forget how to
play hockey.

The Devils found unlikely
heroes in Randy McKay and John
Madden, who each scored four goals
'apiece._ They were only the third
pairof teammates to each score four
goals in a game, the first since the
feat was accomplished in 1922 by
‘Odie Cleghorn and
Cleghorn of Montreal.

The scary thing is that the
defending Stanley Cup Champion
Devils were playing without three
of their top players —.— Jason Arnott
and Scott Neidermayer, who are
holdouts, and Petr Sykora, who
missed his second straight game

with a groin injury. That means in‘

addition to missing one of their best
defenders, the line of Sykora, Arnott
and Patrik’ Elias has been disman-
tled.

When these players get back on
the ice, you have to consider the

Sprague

Devilsto be a serious threat to win
back-to—back.Cups. , .

As for the Penguins, Saturday
night’s massacre was perhaps a rude
awakening, The team was off to a
solid start, but had played mainly

the weaker teams in the league.

Now the players realize they have a

lot of work to do, and at the same ,

time are sorry for what they put
Pittsburgh fans through. »
‘Pens defenseman Bob Boughner
agreed.» “Maybe we should take
money out of our next checks and
pay all the fans who stayed to watch
the rest of that game. It’s .a joke,”
Boughner said. 0

Hey, that wouldn’t be such a bad _

idea.

As a ‘Devils fan, the only disap-
pointing part of the night came. dur-
ing the third period, when the col-
lege football scores ﬂashed on the
screen. -When I left for the game,
Pitt and Virginia Tech were tied at
20. It was killing me not knowing
what had happened, but I had
thoughts of _a major upset swirling
in my head. _ .

Of course I was wrong, as the

scoreboard read Pitt 34, Virginia
Tech 37. 

I’m not going to pound this into
the ground’ because it’s been talked
about so much the past few’ days,
but just how incredibly heartbreak-
ing was Saturday’s loss?

This is no ﬂuke. The Panthers
are just ﬂat out a good football
team. That’s. what makes the loss so
hard to deal with, because it could
have easily been a victory.

The game wasn't supposed to be
close, and few thought it would be,
except for the dedicated Pitt fans
who watch the team week after
week. So when the team lost in the
final seconds of the game, it was
more ‘devastating than if the
Panthers had been blown out.

The Panthers will now look to
rebound this weekend against North
Carolina, but there is no doubt as to

what the bestremedy would be: a’

victory in Miami.

Karen Bielak is' a columnist for The
Pitt News and believes that the
Panthers will indeed stage an upset
against the Hurricanes.

and

 S FROM PAGE 13
After the game however, it’s hard

not to question Pitt’s game plan.
“We were going to throw more

» than run,” Harris said. “I can’t wait

until our run game is clicking,
because then our passing game will
get better. Anytime you lose by a
field goal, you are going to second
guess.’’. ‘

Harris was enthused by his field
marshall. Quarterback John Turman
is coming off -of two of his best
games and was named Big ‘East co.-
offensive player of ‘the week. He
shares the 0 award with Boston
College’s running back William
Green. ‘ '
“[Turman] improves every game

is an intense competitor,”
Harris said. “He had some fabulous
big-time throws against Tech. He is
playing like I expected and he is

developing confidence. He needs us ‘

to run the ball,'but he needs to
throw the ball away better.”
Coincidence ornot, these two

consecutive good starts for Turman
came after he was officially named
Pitt’s starting quarterback for the
rest of the season.

“I want to play up to standards,”
Turman said. “I’m more ca-lm-and
poised on the field. I’m just trying
to help us win every game. Tech is a
tough loss for us. We want to win.
This sets us back.”

At one point yesterday, Harris
grimaced as he talked about field
conditions in Saturday’s game. He

_ blamed the wind as the culprit -for a.

few of the bad punts by Jay Junko
Saturday.

“When they had the ball,” ‘Harris
chuckled, “the wind died.”

Overall, the Pitt coaches are
pleased with the teams’ efforts

against the No. 2 team in the coun-

try.
Harris agreed that there is room

‘for improvement, buthe liked what

he saw.

“I am tremendously proud of the
way we played,” Harris said". “It’s
hard to handle getting close and not
getting it done.”

 

MEET

recorded personal best times-

Gaining respect has been a goal
of the women’s team all year, and
they may finally have garnered
some from their Big East peers by
turning heads and passing some
teams that had run over them in pre-
vious years.

' “Overall, I can’t complain about
the women,” Freeman said of the
performance of, the women’s team.
“They moved up three spots. They
were only 26 points out of -eighth
place, not too far behind Virginia
Tech.” 3

Leading the way for the women
was junior Beth Rocks who had a
personal best time of 18 minutes,
21 seconds, on the 5,000-meter
course. For her efforts, she finished
37th. ‘

‘ Not too far behind her was
Amanda Schmidt, who relinquished
the lead spot on the team for the
first time this season with a finish
of 51st with a time of 18:51.

Dawn Hilgart and Sarah
McMillan also contributed their
bests to the Pitt effort, crossing the
line 62nd (19:19) -and 74th (19:37),
respectively. p “

The women also accomplished
one other goal they had been gear-
ing toward all year.

“We moved out of the basement
[in the Big East],” Freeman said.

The fierce competition did not
intimidate the Pitt men eithertas
they put together one of their most
consistent performances of the sea-

son. _

“Our first four guys ran their
best,” Freeman said.

Included in this group was
senior Mike Head, who finished his
crosscountry career in a big way by
running the 8-kilometer course in
24:59, coming in 33rd in the cham-
pionships.

“In any other conference, he
might have been in the top 14,”
Freeman said.

“Justin Wiley ran it in 25:46,
which was his fastest time,”
Freeman said of his other senior,
who finished 56th.

Sophomore Jessie Chalfant, one
of Pitt’s best half-milers during the
track seasons, stepped up by com-
ing in 71st (26:23), and freshman
Dan Hull rounded out the top run-
ners for Pitt with 77th place
(26:43).

The Big East championships
marked the last cross country meet
of the season for the Pitt competi-
tors.

They will spend the better part
of the month of November prepar-
ing for the indoor track season,
something Freeman said his runners,
are very much looking forward to
doing. . '

“That’s where they really
shine,” Freeman said, pointing out
that Head, Wiley and Chalfant are
the three returning members of a
3,200 relay team that had the best
indoor time in the nation last year.

The Panthers will next put on
the spikes at the annual Blue and
Gold scrimmage on Nov. 19 in
Fitzgerald Field House.
