‘Black Week’ jams with comedy show

difficulties of his life being a fat man.

BEN RUBIN

Staff Writer

At 7:50 p.m.on Saturday, a rnicro—
phone stood silent on the David Lawrence
auditorium stage. By 9:15 a mix of rap,’
song, poetry and comedy rushed from it.

Steel Silly Comedy Jam — part of
Black Action Society’s Black Week,
mixed loud beats with a compilation of
black entertainers, accompanied. by a
crowd of about 100 people.

Scratching R&B and rap remixes on
twin turntables was DJ Nate the Phat
Barber, owner of the Natural " Choice
Barber Shop. As he blasted songs by
DMX, Santana, Big Punisher, Eminem
and many others, groups of people trickled
in until the show began at 9 p.m.

Comedian host “Jimmy. Fast,” his
stage name, introduced Hot Commodity, a
two—man crew who rapped over DJ Nate’s
beats. Next’ came 14-year-old Kerry Allen,

who performed an a cappella version of '

Sisqo’s “Incomplete.”
After the singers, Fast brought up four

poets of differing styles who recited their

original pieces in open mic ‘forum.
“Victor” performed his poem with dra-

' matic inﬂections and motions. He spoke _

about a debate within him, and the differ-

ent “pieces of me” and how they connect-
ed to make his whole person.

James Perkins, stage name “Q,” recit-
ed two poems: One called “The
Pusherman,” about a pusher offering a
metaphorical drug, and “The Candlelight
Flame,” about the beauty of a woman.

‘Three Inches” was an original com-
positions by a student named “Mike,”
which described how he missed out on
being “a super model, like Tyson
[Beckford]” because he was three inches
too short.

Finally, Tarish Pipkins read three of
his poems. “Fruit” was an analogy
between many fruits and a woman’s body,
“Where’s the Love” was an emotional
poem about bringing continuity to the
black community, and “Concrete Jungle”
was a poem about famous blacks
described as numerous jungle animals.

John Jones, stage name “JJ,” who
came out dancing in his all-black
wardrobe, was the ﬁrst comedian to per-
form. He joked about collegiate problems
and mocked the audience.

“Sir” Troy Thomas took the stage
next and told jokes, rapped, and talked
about how a “mind is a terrible thing to
waste.”

“Chill” Bill, the final -performer,

cracked up the crowd as he told them the

“It was all right, but it could have
been better,” Fast said after the show had
ended. He talked about hopes for greater
attendance at Steel Silly’s upcoming show
next month.

 

Thomas said he felt a mix of the
poets’ and comedians’ performances
would have made the show even better,
but despite that, he though the show was a
good one. .

“It was pretty cool,” he said.

Tom Damski is hunting chipmunk.

, Not just any chipmunk, but a partic-
ular striped rodent who has-invaded his
home, otherwise known as the second
ﬂoor of Forbes Hall.

It’s not an ordinary day for Damski,
but as the graduate Resident Director for
Forbes Hall, there really is no day that
could be defined as “ordinary.”

“You have a schedule you try to
keep, but things just come up and the
unusual happens,” Damski ‘said after the
chipmunk hunt.

Many residents may think of their
RD as an urmeeded parent, the watchdog
out to bust students when they try to have
a little fun. For Damski, the position is
not about punishing students, but com-
municating and growing with them.

“You have to develop a dialogue
with the people living here.
Communicate with them, and over time
they really get to know you as more than
a watchdog,” he said. “Now people come
in and just talk to me all the time,”
Damski said, noting with pride that on
the day of the interview he took two res-
idents to lunch. “But you always have to
keep working. Even if you’ve met 100
kids, there’s still 172 to go.”

And today Damski has to communi-
cate with four students crouching behind
him in the student lounge. The dreaded
chipmunk has crawled behind the heater.

“He probably got in through the bal-
cony door,” Damski said. “If he doesn’t
come out of there soon, he’s going to
cook to dea .”

Damski was born in Castle Shannon,
Pa., a southemsuburb of Pittsburgh. He
graduated from Carlow College with a

‘ degree in art education but until becom-

ing an RD at Forbes Hall,‘ had never
lived in a residence hall.
“I used to think residence halls were

there so students could have a place to‘

live. Now I can see there’s a greater
need. In residence halls you develop,
make friends, meet people and really
grow into college,” he said. “When I first
got the letter that said I was an RD, I was
scared ,— I mean, Forbes Hall has 272
residents and I thought, ‘Man, how will I
ever be able to connect to all these kids.’
But now it’s an adventure for me. It’s a
good ﬁt.”

“Tom goes out of his way to make
sure we’re comfortable,” said Nick
Cooper, a sophomore who lives on the
sixth ﬂoor of Forbes Hall. “He’s easy to
talk to and very friendly.” A

A lot. of Darnski’s days are spent
dealing with residents’ problems. He
holds office hours for two hours every
day‘ when students can come and talk
about problems, introduce themselves or
justhave a piece of candy. Damski also
lines up speakers and workshops for

A Forbes Hall.

“I think having fun in the dorm is an
essential part of growing here,” he said.

And of course every now and then
Damski has to deal withtroublemakers.

“Being a disciplinarian is easily my
least favorite part of the job,” Damski
said. “But you have to expect every hall

will have incidents. A gratifying part of it '
’ is that the residents here know enough to

step forward and admit the mistakes they
made.”

“[Tom] makes us feel welcome here,
never like we’re punks,” _ said, sopho-
more Mathews Fessenbecker. “He
spends his own time and money on pro-
jects to help us get to know each other
and have a better time.” ,

“And,” added Fessenbecker with a
grin, “he has a really great beard.” '

“I have always loved working and
talking with people,” Damski said. “The
best part of being an RD is all the people
I get to meet and know.”

Damski’s goal of connecting with ‘

his residents appears to be paying off.
Repeatedly during an hour spent with the
RD, students stopped by to say hi or talk
about a problem. At one point, in mock
anger he even snapped, “Hey! Can’t you
see I’m being interviewed here?”

Besides being an RD, Damski is a
full-time graduate student, working
toward a degree in in administrative pol-
icy studies. In addition, he supervises the
Hand-in—Hand project, a festival for
mentally handicapped children.

Back in the student lounge, the fugi-
tive chipmunk fmally scurried out from
his hiding place, at last cornered behind
a door. Damski slammed a trash can over
the unwelcome critter, carried  out
back and released him in a grassy space
next to Forbes Hall.

“Look at him go,” laughed Damski

as the chipmunk ran alongside the white .

brick hall. “It’s like he’s trying to get
back in.”

Campus groups protest
the Electoral College

DAVE HARTMAN

Assistant News Editor

Nearly 50 protesters rallied in front of

I the Allegheny County Courthouse

Downtown on Saturday afternoon. One
man showed up to protest the protest.
The’group, including members of the
Campus Greens, the International
Socialist Organization and the University

. Democrats waved signs and chanted at

cars and passersby.

According to ISO member Sarah
Grey, the protest was organized to call for
a change in the Electoral College.

Grey said the Electoral College is an
undemocratic way to elect a president.
She said the process is left over from slav-
ery when it was used to prevent blacks
from playing a role in the election

.\ process.

“I don’t support [Al] Gore, but he

, won the popular Vote,” Grey said. “The

person who gets the most votes should be
president.”

With only one University Democrat
attending the event, most protesters
agreed with Grey. ‘

“I’m backing democracy,” said Mark
Yokim, president of the Campus Greens.
Yokim supported and voted for ‘Nader in
last week’s election, but said that it’s
important for the election‘ process to be

 carried out democratically.

“[George W. Bush] is trying to get a
federal judge to block democracy by not
allowing a recount by hand,” Yokim said.

Protesters chanted and waved signs
as three local television networks ﬁlmed

the event. “Bush: Concede with
Dignitude,” one sign read in response to
criticism that Bush makes up words like
“subliminable.”

Similar events took place in almost ‘

100 cities across the country. Pittsburgh’s
protest was attended by student groups,
concerned citizens, and even political
candidates.

Curt Larson, the Green Party’s candi-
date for Pennsylvania state representative

in Tuesday’s election, attended the event _

to increase public awareness about the
process through which elected ofﬁcials
are voted into office.

Larson proposed instituting a system
known as “Instant Runoff Voting,”
whereby voters rank candidates by their
preference, and the ballot is read electron-
ically, allowing voters to have a say in
their second and third choice of candi-
date.

One counterprotester showed up at
the rally. The man, who refused to give
his name, said that Bush is the rightful
winner of the election, and that by allow-
ing a hand count Florida is making itself
susceptible to fraud.

As protesters waved signs and
screamed, cars drove by and honked in
support. Only a handful of passersby
seemed to disagree with the protest. One
car, sporting a Bush/Cheyney sign, drove
slowly by the group at least four times
during their protest. .

Yokim said the goal of the protest
was to get media coverage and to “spread
support for a true democracy and not a
plutocracy or an oligarchy.”

“We got a lot of support,” he said.

requested. The Bush team asked for another machine
count in four counties while the Gore team requested a
hand count in four counties.

At 1:30 a.m on Saturday, three Palm Beach officials
voted two to one in favor of a manual recount which
began 2 p.m. that day. Volusia County has asked for an
extension on the hand-count deadline. If the county is
not able to finish the hand count in the allotted time and
an extension is not granted, the uncounted votes will not
be considered.

The unofficial preliminary results of the the manual
recount are showing that the original statewide recount
is flawed. In four precincts which, together account for
about 1 percent of the population of Florida, Gore gained
19 votes on Bush. A

Using that figure and estimating statewide result
some experts say that Gore could gain almost 2,000
votes on Bush. That would put Florida, and the presi-
dency, in Gore’s hands.

Yesterday, the Bush team filed a lawsuit to stop the
hand recount. Baker said that the lawsuit was filed in
order to “preserve the integrity, equality and finality of
the vote.”

The hearing will be held this morning in Miami.

Should they lose, the Republicans are hinting at
challenging narrow victories in several other states,
including New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Oregon and
New Mexico. ‘ -

New Mexico was originally given to Gore but then,
like Florida, was deemed too close to call. Now Bush is
ahead by only four votes, but some absentee ballots have
yet to be counted. “

New Mexico’s five electoral votes will only come
into play if other states’ results become reversed.

ballot.” At that point, the process could be delayed
weeks. » ~

If, on the other hand, Gore should come out vic-
torious, the Bush team has hinted that they will con-
test several states that Gore won by small margins.
States including Iowa, Wisconsin and, possibly New
Mexico and Oregon.are all considered to have been
won by Gore by a narrow margin. .

Such an outcome could take much longer.
Because there are more people involved, there exists
more potential for error, recounts, lawsuits and
counter—lawsuits,and allegations of fraud.

FROM PAGE 1

On Dec. 18, the electors will meet and vote for '

the president, but if Florida has not been decided by
then, further complications will arise.

A clause in the constitution allows the wirmer of
the majority of electoral votes, in this case Al Gore,
to become president in the case where neither can-
didate reaches the 270 votes necessary for a victory.

Bush and Gore could also conceivably tie in the
Electoral College, opening up even more possibili-
ties. V

One situation would make Bush the president
and Sen. Joe Lieberman the vice president. When

the Electoral College is tied, which could happen if ’

a number of states are contested and reversed, then

the U.S. House of Representatives, which has a"

Republican majority, would pick the president.

The Senate, which has no apparent majority as
of yet,‘ would select the vice president. In such a
case, Lieberman would likely win because of his
popularity in the Senate.

However, because Lieberman won aseat in the
Senate this year, there is question as to whether he

can vote for himself or not. Regardless, if the senate
vote ended in a tie, then the leader of the senate
would break the tie. Vice President Gore, the leader
of the Senate, would certainly pick his ‘running
mate. _ , -

Those are all fairly unlikely scenarios, _but a
more likely one would be that Rep.- Dennis Hastert,
R—l]l., would become acting president for an interim
period. As speaker of the house, Hastert comes after
the vice president in replacing the president.

For instance, if the president and the vice presi-
dent both die, the speaker of the -house becomes;
president. Likewise, if a president is not chosen by?-
Jan. 20, 2001, then Hastert could become the acting
president until the election is decided. 

Regardless of what happens, some experts have
projected that America will not have a working cab-*
inet until November of 2001. That date could easily:

1 be postponed a yearor more.

According to political experts, tremors like this
one generally bring about goodtgovernmental times
for the country. Usually‘ several bills get passed that
normally would not, because the Republicans and
Democrats want to prove to the nation that they can
work together. -

Another possible complication involves the
Electoral College itself. The electors who we vote
for are not legally bound in all states to vote their
party. It is very rare, and has occurred only nine.
times in our nation’s history, but with the recent inci-
dents it is possible that some of those electors have
become disgusted with their party and could change
their mind. ,

Most years it wouldn’t matter if one elector
changed their vote, but 2000 is certainly not most
years. 3

It is a year when “every vote counts.” ’

SGB presidential candidates face off

Este Grifﬁth, Michael Guss and Mike Unangst have chosen to run for Student Government Board president. The president’s term — a shortened one because of
the recently passed referendum —— will last from January to April. Another election will be held in April for a term that will last from May to the following April.

Last week, the three introduced themselves at Meet the Candidates. Students were also able to ask them questions at the first presidential debate Thursday night.
This evening all three will participate in Pitt Jeopardy, a new event this year. V

On Wednesday, students will be able to vote for one presidential candidate and ﬁve boardmembers to fill eight vacancies on the board. The Pitt News recently sat

down with each of the candidates and looked into their platforms.

—. Interviews by Rehan Nasir; Editor in Chief

Michael Guss. Este Griffith   Mike Unangst

Michael Guss said that there’s too much ﬁghting within
SGB and “they forget that we’re all students.”

“I’m running to unite the student body,” he added

Guss, who cunenﬂy has no ties to SGB, is planning on
speciﬁc changes if elected He wants to implement campaign
ﬁnance refonn, interrns of a spending cap. Presently there is
no cap, and Guss wants a $150 limit.

“Candidates should alsobe free to speakand notbelim—
ited by Elections Committee regulations,” Guss said

Guss also wants to reopen the nursing library. It was
closed during the summer, since the administration said
many of the journals and books were present in other
libraries and thus were urmecessary.

“Having only one book hurts students,” Guss said
“Also, [the students] have lost a place to study.”

Another area Guss wants to attack is extending same-
sex beneﬁts for faculty and statf at Pitt.
“I know that many faculty and staff support it,” Guss

said. “The board doesn’t understand how much it hurts the .

University. The SGB president should tell legislators and
lobby forthe beneﬁts.” ’ _

Other topics include making SGB listen to the “little
things.”

“We should change it from being about student govem—
ment to students’ needs,” he said.

Guss also believes that SGB should foster a stronger
sense of community by hosting events off-campus.

“They should be something specialand be alcohol—free
so that all students could attend,” he said.

Linking Greeks and non-Greeks is also important to
Guss, who says that both groups could work together to
advance their common goals as students.

While Guss has many goals for SGB, he believes ﬂiat in
the short amount of time, they can be accomplished

“They need to spend less time ﬁghting each other. It’s
self-destruction. We need to spend more time ﬁghting

“It’s going to take a lot of hard work”

Guss is a junior political science major who is running
on a slate with Rob Loper.

Este Griffith does not believe, the board can

accomplish its goals while working the way it is now.

“The board’.s role is to distribute resources and
tools to students so they can effectively organize,”
she said. “The board is more attached to the admin-
istration and isn’t using students to challenge the
administration. They’re not using the real power on
campus —— the students.”

Grifﬁth sees three vital components to student
government, “communication, information and
action.” _

Through an SGB publication, board members
and committee chairs would be able to write down
all of their activities — to clearly show what SGB
has been doing.

In addition to the reports, she wants to let stu-
dents know what is going on in the Faculty Senate
and Board of Trustees.

“We need to show the students where the tuition
money is going — how the money is directly affect-
ing students,” she said. '

_ In light of recent debate over Proposition A ’—
the proposal to change the time of SGB elections —
Griffith also wants columns in the publication, to
show both sides of the issues.

“The publication would also serve as a resource
to the students, including administrative Contact
information,” Grifﬁth said. “The information within
the publication would serve as a catalyst to help stu-
dents resolve their problems. It’ll also hold board
members and committee members accountable.”

Grifﬁth’s approach is a bottom—up one, a grass
roots method to cause change within the University.

“We’d like to go to students  [with] ways to
accomplish their goals,” she said. “This approach has
been seen in the past and has been very effective.”

Griffith, a senior political science major, is on
the Constitutional Review and Governmental
Relations committees. She is running on a slate with
Sarah Dadlani and Desiree Williams.

“I know what the role of president is,” Unangst
said. “It’s to manage the ofﬁce and ensure that they’re'
working hard and focused on their goals.” . V

Unangst wants each of the members of SGB to

eight board members focusing their energy on three or
more projects each.

“We must ﬁnd out what is important to the board
and then to the students, then prioritize the goals of the
board,” he said. “It’s more effective if you have eight
people attacking one major issue.” , "

Unangst said that SGB would poll students by e-
mail and continue finding out the major issues that
students have. ,

“We need to find the major issues and plan. Four
months is not a long time,” he said. ' .

something Unangst has done as a board member — he

EDITORIAL
Ruling prohibiting gay and
lesbian adoption is ridiculous

At this point in our lives, most
of us are finally mature enough to
acknowledge how challenging‘

‘ parenting must be. Devoting years

of one’s life to providing and car-
ing for a child until he or she is
independent enough to care for
him or herself is no small feat.
Doing so may be even more diffi-
cult for adoptive parents, who
have to undergo numerous back-
ground checks and legal proceed-
ings. Given the immense nature of
such a responsibility, it seems that
anyone who is willing and capable
of taking on the task should have
the opportunity to do so.

Unfortunately, the
Pennsylvania State Superior Court
does not seem to share this opin-
ion. Last week, it suspended adop-
tions by gay and lesbian couples
on the basis that since they are not
married, they do not comply with
terms of the state adoption law.
Formerly, gay and lesbian adop-
tions were permitted in 14
Pennsylvania counties, including
Allegheny County.

Such a ruling is a tragedy both
for both the gay and lesbian par-
ents who want to adopt and the
children who are up for adoption.
In particular, there is a dire need of
homes for older children, as many

couples desire to adopt babies or
younger children. Our state cannot
afford to turn away prospective
parents on the basis of sexual ori-
entation or marital status.

Furthermore, the court’s ruling
implies that not only gays and les-
bians. but all unmarried people are
unfit to adopt children. While rais-
ing -a child as a single mother or
father would certainly prove diffi-
cult in many respects, it is unfair
to assume that children with one
parent will automatically receive
an inferior upbringing. In our soci-
ety today there are millions of sin-
gle parents who do in fact meet
this challenge. Single people who
want to adopt should have the
right.

It is time that Pennsylvania’s
legal system realizes what most of
us have learned over the course of

our childhood and adolescence —'

that parental love comes in a vari-
ety of shapes and is manifest in a
number of ways. Over the years,
our parents have proven their love
by teasing us, feeding us, talking
to us, supporting us and embar-
rassing us. It is preposterous to
assume that only heterosexual
married couples are capable of
offering such a special type of sac-
rifice and care.

Election reflections

What a long,-strange trip it’s been. This
has been one of our country’s most amazing
and historic elections. Unfortunately, it has
also been chock—full of soft money, bad candi-
dates and erroneous statements (case in point:
Vice President Al Gore claiming that he

invented the Internet). Not to mention all the A

KATE  

voter apathy and possible voter

First of all, let’s take a look
at the money aspect. The major
-party candidates discussed
campaign finance reform '
somewhat but didn’t really put any kind of

A emphasis on it. .

Let’s get something straight here, guys.
Campaign finance reform should not be an
issue; it should be the only issue. More money
has been contributed to campaigns during this
election than in any other in American history.

Corporate political contributions are actu-
ally illegal according to a 1907 law. But, using
a loophole that allows for party building, cor-
porations can make unlimited donations to
political parties, rather than speciﬁc candi-
dates. Such contributions are referred to as soft
money. During this election season, huge con-
tributions were made to both parties by
Microsoft, AT&T, Motorola, Phillip Morris,
pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Meyers Squibb
and BP Amoco. ,

Soft money contributions for this election
were expected to be more than half a billion
dollars, and both parties are equally guilty of
receiving such funds. ’I'hat’s double the
amount spent in the last presidential election,
and six times the amount spent in 1992.

Think of what else could have been done
with all this money. How many schools could
have been built? How many people fed? How
many children vaccinated?

Then there is the Republican candidate,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. I am still won-
dering how this man got to be as close as he is
to being one of the most powerful people in

the world After all, we’re talking about a man ’

who until a few days before the election was
unaware that Social Security is a federal pro-

 

GIAMMARISE

gram. Let me repeat that for added emphasis
— we’re talking about one of our govem-
ment’s biggest programs, something that
accounts for millions in federal dollars, and
Bush isn’t familiar enough with it to know that
it’s federally-run. Also, remember that Bush is
a man whose own running mate didn’t even
’ a bother to vote for him.

Consider the Ralph Nader
factor. Consumer advocate and
presidential -candidate Nader’s
candidacy was probably one of
. the most exciting and energiz-
ing aspects of this election. N ader, being from
a third party, pretty much had only one chance

. of winning.— if there had been some kind of

terrorist attack on Washington, D.C., or per-
haps some kind of natural disaster, causing
both presidential candidates and many mem-
bers of Congress to die.

This is truly unfortunate, seeing as how
Nader was the only candidate who could hon-
estly say that he wasn’t for sale. Although the
Nader campaign failed to reach its goal of
attaining 5 percent of the popular vote (and
‘earning federal matching funds for the next

' election), Nader’s candidacy energized hun-

dreds of thousands of people. Although the
mainstream media largely ignored him until

the bitter end (when he started scaring Gore), .

Nader ran an amazing campaign. Had he been
allowed to participate in the debates, he may
have even taken a few electoral votes.

The way things look at this point, Bush
may likely be our next president. On that note,
I’d just like to leave you all with a ﬁnal
thought. During a Republican primary debate
in New Hampshire, Bush was asked what
would be the ﬁrst thing he would do if he were
elected president. Bush responded by saying
that he would get down on his knees and ask
God to help him. At this point, candidate Gary
Bauer interjected, adding, “If you get elected,
that’s the ﬁrst thing we’re all going do.”

Kate Giammarise hopes the election is
resolved by Jan. 20 -— otherwise Strom
Ihurmond becomes president. '

Lately, there has been much contro-

_ versy over the Electoral College, the

process we use to elect our president. I
believe that many of these arguments are
‘invalid and much of the public hasn’t

‘ heard both sides of the argument. The

Electoral College not only ensures
democracy, but it also ensures that the
presidential candidates earn not only the
voice of the majority, but the minority as
Well.

argues that the Electoral College is not
democratic and that it gives the people

no say in who becomes president.

However, this is not true. With a popular
vote, presidential candidates could real-
istically ignore the minority.

But under the current system, candi-
dates must tend to every group, whether
it be farmers in the Midwest
or the elderly in Florida. For

ulation is black. However, in
many southern states, blacks

I V constitute over half of the voters, making

it impossible to ignore the minority. In a
popular election any side could ignore
the black population. Is that democracy?

However, you cannot win an elec-
tion in Florida without tending to the
elderly. The Electoral College ensures
democracy by making the voice of the
minority important. It makes each vote

. count.

At the time of our nation’s birth,

‘many of the smaller colonies were con-

cemed-about not having equal represen-

s tation in government fearing that they

would be overpowered by the larger
states. A compromise was made with the
creation of the Senate and the Electoral
College. With;-the Senate, smaller states

' are given an; equal say in lawmaking...

With the Electoral College, smaller

The total ‘population of Wyoming,

; Montana and North Dakota is not equiv-

alent to the population of some major
U.S. cities. If we had a popular ‘vote, why
would any candidate visit. these states

when they could focus their energies on

urban areas? It would not be economi-
cally wise to. travel to the Midwest when

‘ a candidate could focus his or her ener-

gies on the national level- in urban areas.
A popular election would undermine the
participation of voters in small states.
Another concern of many of the
colonies upon—~,entering the union was the
separation of power between federal and
state governments. Many states were
afraid of a powerful. national goVem—

ment.

In a popular election, the concerns of
individual counties and states would be
ignored. It would transform the carn-
paigning from a grass roots effort to a
national effort. Focusing on the concerns
of each state and each country would not
be cost effective. Is that democracy?

The Electoral College forces each
candidate to respond to ' local needs
whereas in a popular election, that would
not be necessary. James Madison argued
in the Federalist papers that government
“is, in strictness, neither a national nor a
federal Constitution, but a combination
of both.” The selection of the president is
a plurality of the states’ opinion rather
than a simple majority of the people’s.

I would be lying if I claimed that the
current system is ﬂawless. The human

electors were created not to
. deceive the people, but
because large-scale cam-
paigning was impossible

_ . ‘ the 18th century. The peo-
ple were to select an elector whose opin-

' ion they trusted. This speciﬁc policy is

outdated, something that 26 other states
agree with by making it law that the elec-
tors stay faithful to the majority opinion
in that state. Judging from history, I
believe that faithfulness isn’t much of-an
issue.

In conclusion, the opposition claims
that the Electoral College is undemocra-
tic. This is not true. I believe that a pop-

. ular vote would be undemocratic.

I also find it interesting that as soon
as one person does not like’ the outcome
of the election, he or she opposes the sys-
tem. The Democrats did not seem to
oppose the Electoral College when it
looked as if Al Gore was going to lose
the popular vote and win-the Electoral
College. , I

I agree that the Electoral College has
its ﬂaws. But it is obviously impossible
to create a perfect electoral system. I
believe that the Electoral College has

worked well and still does. The problem.

with the election this year lies in the two-
party system (another topic in itself)
rather than the Electoral College. -

Lastly, it is imperative. that we stick‘

to a system; otherwise, any time a candi-
date does not like the outcome of an elec-
tion, he or she can challenge the system.
By challenging the Electoral College
after the election, the Gore campaign is

mocking the American political process.

The Electoral. College has greatly

DAVID

W. Bush, received a majority of votes in
Texas, he received all 32 electoral votes.

This system is inherently undemocra-
tic. The United States should operate on
the principle of one person, one vote.
According to, our. most fundamental
beliefs, every person in this country who
goes to the polls has an equal say.

But the Electoral College makes this
not the case. For example, I am a liberal
Democrat from Texas, a Republican
stronghold. Throughout the campaign (at
least after former Sen. Bill Bradley was
eliminated from contention), I supported
Vice President Al Gore. However, I knew
that my vote for Gore would not count
because my home state would go strong-
ly for Bush; thus, without committing a
crime or being the victim of racist laws or
anything like that, I was disenfranchised.

So I ended up voting for Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader in an attempt to
help him gain the 5 percent of the popular

vote he would need to qualify for federal .

matching ﬁmds for campaigning — at
least that way my vote would have some
P“1l30S3-

Sure enough, Bush carried 63 percent
of Texas‘ popular vote and thus all of its
electoral votes. But what’ about the 37
percent of us who did not vote for him?

Our voices are now silenced.

This is not democracy; this is tyranny
of the majority. Our democracy is based
on the principle that the majority will rule
but that the views of the minority will be
respected, listened to and considered. The
Electoral College does no such thing —-
instead, it gives the majority absolute
control and the minority no voice whatso-
ever.

Only a couple of states divide their
electoral votes based on a proportional
division instead of a winner—take-all sys-

tem. This is, however, just as bad, since it
still gives supporters of candidates such
as Nader and the Reform‘ Party’s Patrick
Buchanan no voice. Some would say this
is a good thing; indeed, many supporters
of the Electoral College say that it is
indispensable in marginalizing third—party
candidates, something they consider a
beneﬁt.

Marginalizing anyone’s voice should
never be considered a beneﬁt of a system.
No matter how much Buchanan’s views
scare me, they are his
views and should have a
place in the system. After
all, those who are alienated
by a system for long
enough will try to subvert it
'  ‘ from outside. _

In 1787, the United ‘States consisted
of 13 states that were practically indepen-
dent countries. The framers of the
Constitution originally wanted to say “We
the States” in the Preamble, but changed
it to -“We the People” at the last minute.
Although at the time they meantifor the
federal government to be more similar to
what the United Nations is — that is, a
grouping of somewhat autonomous states
— this is not the case today. Instead, we
are a nation-state.

In 1787, geographic-based represen-
tation may have made sense as each state
was much more distinct and homoge-
neous. However, this is no longer true.
The United States has the most mobile
population in the world. Many people live
in different states than the ones in which
they were born. 

State boundaries are arbitrary divi-
sions; thus, the views of almost everyone
in that state will not be the same. For
example, if largely poor and Hispanic
South Texas were its own separate state,
Gore would have carried it. But instead,
these people had no say. South Texas has
a larger population than a lot of states —
why should its citizens’ voices be silenced
while the voices of the citizens of
Wyoming are ampliﬁed?

Changing the system to‘ a popular
vote would eliminate this problem; every-
one, no matter in what state he or she
lives, would have the same voice. I real-
ize that this would take an amendment to
the Constitution, but is the process of rat-
ifying an amendment such a large price to
pay for righting an injustice?

Give democracy a chance.

David McKenzie doesn’t see why his
ﬁiends from Florida and Pennsylvania
have more of a voice than he does. After
all, he does have a rather loud voice.

Antonio Bryant jaws with Miami’s Al Blades after a war.

Miami defense too
much for Panthers

BRAD CUPRIK
Assistant Sports Editor

MIAMI — For Pitt wide receiver

Antonio Bryant and defensive back
Torrie Cox, the return to Florida was
not a welcome one.
Bryant and Cox graduated from
Northwestern High in Miami, and
chose to head north to Pitt to play
football. '

In Saturday’s 35-7 loss to the
Hurricanes, their return was marred
by dropped passes, overthrown balls
and the overwhelming speed of the
Miami receivers.

Bryant finished the game with
just four receptions for 31 yards, and
did not score a touchdown for the
first time since the 24-17 double-

overtime loss to Syracuse Oct. 17.

Coming into the game, Bryant
led the nation in receiving yards per
game, averaging 148.9, and also with
7.4 receptions per game and 1,042
total receiving yards.

“[Miami’s] defensive backs were
very quick,” Bryant said. “They got
to the ball and didn’t give me too
much room.”

The last time Bryant played a
game at the Orange Bowl, he was a
senior in, high school playing in the
Florida 6A championship game.

He was not recruited by Miami,
although he Wanted to play for them
badly. Last season, in his first game
against them, he caught just two
passes for 20 yards at Pitt Stadium.

Panthers fall victim to No. 2
Hurricanes in 35-7 loss  

MARIO MACHI
_§ports Editor

IVHAMI —Atrip to South Florida in
the middle of November can mean many
things. It can strike up memories of
beautiful vacations filled with palm
trees, 80—degree weather and bright blue
skies. But for the Pitt football team,
Saturday’s trip to Miami will be remem-
bered as a nightmare, as the No. 2
Hurricanes blew past Pitt, 35-7, before a
crowd of 47,520 at the Orange Bowl.

‘‘They’re just a great football team,”
Pitt head coach Walt Harris said. “That’s
why tl1ey’re ranked so highly.”

The nation’s leading receiver, Pitt’s
Antonio Bryant, was held to just 31
yards on four catches in his homecoming
game. Bryant attended F1orida’s
Northwestern High School and always
wanted to attend a Florida school. But
when the scholarship offers didn’t come,
he headed north to the Steel City. He said
that he thinks teams are starting to see
things in his game that are making it
harder for him to get open to catch the
ball.

“Yeah, they’re ﬁguring out what I
do,” Bryant said. “It’s frustrating,
because I couldn’t get open a few times
today.” .

Bryant wasn’t the only Panther to

have a bad day. Pitt quarterback John ‘

Turman had a tough outing as well, com-
pleting 17 of 31 passes for 177 yards and
two crucial interceptions. 'I‘urrnan’s first

interception made the ﬁrst points of the >

day. . A  *
In the ﬁrst quarter,  Pitt'.,was dri-
ving toward the Miami end zone,
Turman dropped back topass and was hit
just as he threw. His wobbling pass was
picked off by Phillip Buchanon and
returned all die way for a"71-yard touch-
down.   "
However, Buchanon wascalled for
an excessive celebration penalty for

dancing into the end jzoine, resultingvina;
35-yard extra point « for Todd ‘Sieversr’

Sievers pulled the kick wide to the left,
and Miami led 6-0.

Pitt didn’t give up after the touch-
down, though. The Panthers came right
back with a l0—play, 58-yard drive that
culminated with T‘urman ﬁnding tight
end Kris Wilson for a 4-yard touchdown

pass. -

But that would be the only real high-
light for Pitt. On Mia.mi’s next drive,
quarterback Ken Dorsey led the ‘Canes
down the ﬁeld before it appeared that
they were stymied by the Pitt defense at
Pitt’s 29-yard line. But a pass interfer-
ence call on third down against Pitt’s
William “Tutu” Ferguson prolonged the
drive, which eventually ended with

extra point was good, and Miami led 13-

 had a great opportunity to
score, but with fourth-and— goal inside the
l—yard line, James Jackson was stopped
by the Pitt defense with under a minute
to go in the half, and Pitt went into the
break with the momentum.

“Our guys stood in there and did a
helluva job,” Harris said.

When the teams came out of the
locker room for the second half, every-
thing appeared to be the same. The teams

were wearing the same uniforms and the 7

weather was still beautiful, but some-
thing had changed.

. The change. was on the field, where
the Miami Hurricanes showed why they
are the‘ No. 2 team in the nation.

Pitt received the ball first to start the
half, and on the first play from scrim-
mage of the third quarter, Kevan Barlow
broke free through the line for a solid
gain. But Barlow was stripped of the ball
at the end of the play, and Miami recov-
ered the fumble.

Miami began at Pitt’s 32-yard line,
and it took just six plays for the
Hurricanes to score. The key play of the
drive was a fourth-and-nine from the Pitt
31, where the Hurricanes went for the
conversion. Dorsey found tight end Ivan
Mercer for a 15-yard gain and a new set
of downs. Two plays later, the Dorsey-
Mercer connection resulted in a touch-
down from 12 yards out, and after
Dorsey ran in the two—point conversion,
Miami led 21-7.

“We just didn’t execute properly [in
the third quarter],” Pitt linebacker Brian
Beinecke said. ‘

Panthers defeat California Au.tars,ess?z:71

in 7 Senior Staff 

Ricardo Greer posted a triple-
double and junior.Zelimir Stevanovic
poured in 16 points to lead Pitt past
the California All-Stars,’ 87-71,
Saturday night at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

The All—Star team, made up of
former collegi-ate stars, , including
Penn’s Michael Jordan and
Mary1and’s Terrell Stokes, put up the
Panthers’ final competition before
their season starts Friday, against
North Carolina A&T State.

Greer, playing at his natural small
forward position, scored 19 points,
pulled down 11 rebounds and dished
out 10 assists. Stevanovic, who start-
ed the game at shooting guard, made
four of five shots from behind the arc.

Senior forward Issac Hawkins
finished in double figures with 11
points and point guard Brandin
Knight scored 10. Knight finished the
game with five turnovers to only one
assist.

“Ricardo’s triple—double was-

impressive,” head coach Ben
Howland said. “Although, I’d like to
see him save that.-for Big East play.”

Pitt’s offense struggled early, as
they did not score until the 15:19
mark of the first half.

Knight turned the ball over twice
and the All-Stars’ Kirk King threw
down two slam-dunks to put his team
up 10-2.

from the free-throw line to get Pitt’s”:
eoffense. in_motion. After the Brown

shot, Pitt reeled off six more points to
close the gap to 12-10.

The game went back and forth
throughout the first half with Pitt
always keeping it close. In the final
two minutes of the half, Pitt went on
a 9-2 run.

Trailing 34-28,"   Stevanoviciiu

knocked down a three pointer.

Following that; Knight drove into the

middle of the lane for a layup.

In Pitt’s final two possessions of
the half, Greer tipped in a Hawkins
miss and Hawkins threw down a shot
as time expired to give Pitt a 37-36
lead.

“Our guys responded well,”
Howland said. “We were real impa-
tient early.”

Three minutes into the second
half, Pitt’s center Chris Seabrooks
picked up his fourth foul and was
benched. The Big East has ordered
their referees to call games closer this
season. ' ,

“It’s no secret that they’re really
calling it tight this year,” Howland
said. ‘ ’

Because of Seabrooks’ benching,‘

Greer and Hawkins were forced to
play extra minutes. Both finished the
game logging 33 minutes played.

At the 13:50 point of the second
half, Pitt’s offense turned up the heat,
going on an 11-0 run, which included
a combined seven points from Brown
and swingman Chad Johnson.

Miami defeated Pitt, 35-7, Saturday at
the Orange Bowl. g

Those in the Steel ' City who
watched the game probably still don’t
think too highly of the citizens of this part of
the nation. But the Panthers have no one to - ,
blame but themselves for the loss to Miami. '

But the Hurricanes keyed on

   
  
  
  
    

blew open a close game at the half.

 -» What did Pitt do wrong? For starters,
 the Panthers failed once again to establish
-a running game. Kevan Barlow had his
first good run of the game on the first play of
the third quarter, but it was negated when
Barlow fumbled the ball away. A touchdown
on the ensuing drive put Pitt down by 14

points and led the Hurricanes to the blowout.
Pitt also had some key misses by Turman,
some that were his fault. There were at least
four dropped passes in crucial situations
during the game by the Pitt receivers, and
Turman missed Latef Grim early in the

31 yards in the game. ,

John Turman came into the game as the nation’s
third-leading passer, but he was just 17 of 31 for 177
yards. Turman also threw two costly interceptions,
including one on Pitt’s first possession that Phillip
Buchanon returned for a 71-yard touchdown.

have been a Pitt touchdown.

It was a beautiful day in Miami, yet I haven’t
seen an uglier performance from the Pitt team all
year long. Now, Pitt must correct its mistakes in
preparation for next week’s clash with Temple.

Pitt began the season 5-1, but three consecutive

losses have made a bowl game anything but a sure
possibility. The Panthers must make some serious
changes if next week’s game will be any different
than the last three games.

The changes that need to be made don’t neces-
sarily need to be made on the ﬁeld, although that
might help, too. The necessary changes involve the
team’s attitude. After Barlow’s fumble early in the
second half, the Panthers seemed to give up.
Cornerback Torrie Cox all but conﬁrmed that after
the game, saying the Panthers were “deﬂated” after
the turnover.

That should never be the case.

I don’t care what the score is. Pitt cannot give
up. Sure, the defense was on the field for most of the
second half, and that can be attributed to the
offense’s ineffectiveness, but that’s no excuse for a
team giving up. I know that Miami beat Virginia
Tech last week, and there is no doubt in my mind that
the ‘Canes are one of the best teams in the nation.
However, that doesn’t change my feeling that Pitt
isn’t as bad as it seemed in Saturday’s loss.

“I was too hyped in the game last
year,” Bryant said. “I tried to do too
much.”

But Miami’s defensive backfield
deserves credit, too.

One of the Hurricanes’ defensive
backs, Phillip Buchanon, intercepted
two John Turman passes. Buchanon
returned his first pick 71 yards for a
Miami touchdown to open the
game’s scoring.

It was the fifth time the ‘Canes
returned an interception for a score
this season, tying the team record set

FROM PAGE 12

g in 1967.

“The interception was big,” Cox
said. “But there were too many mis-
takes on both sides of the ball.”

Turman threw the ball over the
head of wide receiver Latef Grim on
several occasions and missed Bryant
in the third quarter on a pass that
could have gone for a touchdown.

“That was my fault,” Bryant
said. “I should have stopped and
turned around. It was there. I just
didn’t catch the ball.”

Grim said that Bryant told him
everything was fine and agreed about
the skill level of the Miami sec-
ondary.

“They were very talented back
there,” Grim said. “We didn’t exe-

cute, though, and that was a big dif-
ference.”

In Saturday’s Miami Herald,
Bryant was featured in a picture from
the game before the 6A champi-
onship, in which he caught a touch-
down on the game’s final play to win
it for Northwestern.

Also on that state titleteam was
Cox, a running back, who played the
same position for the Panthers for his
first season and a half, before con-
verting to defensive back.

Cox saw plenty of playing time
in Pitt’s 20-17 loss to North Carolina
last Saturday, and was victimized by
Santana Moss and Reggie Wayne.

Moss, along with Bryant, is a
semifinalist or the Biletnikoff
Award, given to the nation’s top wide
receiver. He caught six passes for
100 yards in the game, but did not
score on a reception or on a punt
return.

‘Those two are fast guys,” Cox
said. “Speed-wise, that’s the best
team we played.”

Cox was the team’s third—string
running back last season and with the
addition of Darcey Levy and full-
back ‘Dustin Picciotti, Cox felt the
switch to the defensive side of the
ball was needed.

“It wasn’t the homecoming ‘I
wanted,” Cox said. “A win would
have been better for me and

The fourth down conversion on the
drive was Miarni’s second in five
attempts on the day, as head coach Butch
Davis proved that the entire ﬁeld was
“fou11;h—down territory.”

Down 21-7, the Panthers just could
not get it going on offense. Turman and
his receivers were not on the same page,
and the running game was rendered inef-
fective by Miami’s front seven.

The game was, for all intents and
purposes, put out of reach with 6:17 left

in the third quarter when Reggie Wayne '

caught a 7—yard pass from Dorsey to
make the score 28-7 in favor of 

Jackson closed out the scoring on
the second play of the ‘fourth quarter
with a 7—yard touchdown run.

“We got up for this game,” Harris
said. “Our players were ready to play.’’

“Can we execute at this level? I
don’t know,” he said

The Panthers will now close out the
season with a game at Temple next
Saturday, followed by the annual
“Backyard Brawl” against West Virginia
on Nov. 24 at Three Rivers Stadium.
Pitt still needs one win to qualify for a
bowl, although one Win won’t guarantee
a postseason appearance.

“We just gotta win these last two
garnes so that we can play in a bowl,”
Pitt linebacker Amjr Purifoy said.

Johnson finished the game with eight
points and Brown finished with
seven.

“I’m pleased with our six perime-
ter guys,” Howland -said. “We don’t
have enough minutes to go around.

We might play Ricardo at power for-

ward so we can get them in.”

The run took the air out of the
traveling team, as their defense
slumped and Pitt continued to add to
their lead, until the final buzzer mer-
cifully sounded.

Pitt made 53% of its shots from
the field and out—rebounded the All-

the A1l—Stars 50-35, in the second

King had the game-high with 22

Greer played over 3OAminutes.

Howland said that the team still
hasn’t put all of the offensive plays in
yet. The team will practice for the

But I never thought I’d see the
Panthers play so poorly. Pitt has been

a team that plays better against the top-

teams (see Virginia Tech), while
underestimating the not-so—good
teams (see North Carolina). People

on the rise, but until the Panthers win. ‘
