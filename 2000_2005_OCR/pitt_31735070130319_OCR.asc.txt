If Joan Snyder has her way with
the fifth floor of the William Pitt
Union, it will soon become a “mecca
of student activity.”

The Student Government Board
president unveiled plans for renova-
tions for the ﬂoor at last night’s
weekly meeting. The fifth ﬂoor
serves as a home base for most of
Pitt’s student organizations.

“[We’re going to] spice up the

‘fifth ﬂoor with the limited space we

have,” she said.

, Snyder met with Vice Provost and
Dean of Students ‘Sharon Johnson last
Wednesday, and plans to draft a letter
to submit to Provost James Maher to
request funding for the project on
Thursday.

The refurbished ﬂoor will include A

storage areas for student groups, so
organizations could stow items like
skis and sports equipment.

A new work area will allow
groups the space they need to create
and decorate signs and posters. New
cubicles are planned, and new carpet-
ing is also part of the design. Desk
chairs will come with ports for laptop

 

computers. The Board isalso request-
ing a welcome sign in addition to dry
erase boards and calendars so that
student groups can coordinate their
events.

Snyder said. the architect could
have the ﬂoor work completed by- the
spring term, if everything goes as
she’s planned. '

“I hope everybody likes this,”

- Snyder said. “We workedreally hard

on this.” _

Another change proposed just in
time for the spring term is to Pitt IDs.

All student ID cards will be
replaced by January 2001. The IDs
will differentiate between student,
staff and faculty, and will also func-
tion at automatic teller machines.

‘“It’s really pretty,” Snyder saidof
the new design, which will feature
the convocation center and a panther,
among other things.

Snyder was also excited to report
on the status of this Sunday’s
Sisterhood: Empowerment Now!
women’s conference. '

The conference will feature a day-
of workshops, led by various women

from Pitt, Chatham College and the‘

Pittsburgh region. They will present

The effectiveness of defibrilla-
tors is slowly catching on in the
United States.

Hospitals have always had
them, only about 50 percent of the
nation’s emergency vehicles have
them.

Pitt is responding and will soon
install. four top—notch Survivalink
Automatic External Defibrillators
in Pitt police Vehicles.

‘‘All the training and paperwork
and certification is completed, we
just need the defibrillators,” said
Pitt police officer Robert Kolesky.

An AED is an electronic device
used to analyze the heart’s rhythm.
If the heartbeat is irregular, the
device tells the user to deliver a
shock — a defibrillation —- to the

patient. The machine is very simple
to useand walks users through,,step
by step.
“It’s foolproof,” Kolesky said.
According to Kolesky, the first
step when arriving on a scene is to

check for pulse and breathing and

administer CPR until
arrives with an AED.

Pads are placed on the patient’s
upper right portion and lower left
portion of the chest and the machine
starts up. _

The machine will advice users
to stand clear, analyze the patient
and one of two things can happen.

The device will either tell the
user, “shock advised and charging,”
or the device will say “check for
pulse, if no pulse start CPR.”

If the device deems it necessary
to shock, the machine will tell the
user to administer the shock. The
machine itself will not shock, the

SOIIIBOIIC

user must push the button. No one
may touch the patient, and everyone
near must report they are ‘‘clear’’ of
him or her. A

“When itshocks you, _it stops
the irregular beat and lets the heart
restart itself into a normal rhythm,”
Kolesky said.

Kolesky, a Pitt officer since
1964 and a volunteer firefighter

since 1953, immediately saw the

effectiveness and importance of

,AEDs after implementing AEDs. in

the Oakdale. Fire Department in
1999.

Soon after the installation, the
fire department saved an elderly
man who was suffering from respi-
ratory and cardiac arrest, and has
seen a significant increase in the
number of saved lives.

Thanks to Kolesky’s persistence
and a self-prepared proposal to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, the

devices added to Pitt police cars

Pitt police will soon install the
AEDs in some vehicles, as four
AEDs and a training model were
purchased.

“These are the Cadillacs of

AEDs, the others are the Chevys,”
Kolesky said. ‘.‘They work, but
they’re harder to use. With this one
it doesn’t matter.”

Kolesky, a certified Red Cross
emergency responder, and officer
Tracey Harsyn, have trained all _94
personnel in the Pitt Police Force.

The cost of the AEDS, AED
training, first-aid training and CPR
training is approximately $14,000.

“Basically, over the years we’ve
always maintained first aid and
CPR training,” Kolesky. said “With

the automatic defibrillators, the’

benefits are immense.”

Freshman Julie Moreau ﬁowns as
she scribbles furiously on her notebook
paper, desperate to keep up with seventh-
grader Jasmine as the two delve into
dividing fractions.

“It’s been a while,” Moreau admits.
She scratches out her work a few times
until she’s ﬁnally satisﬁed with her
answer and compares it with Jasmine’s.
The two ﬁnd a discrepancy and Moreau
examines how Jasmine completed the
problem.

‘‘There’s an easier wayto solve that,”
says Moreau and shows Jasmine a trick
she does remember on how to simplify
fractions. Jasmine reworks the problem
and this time the answers match.

From 34:30 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, between 10 and 15 Pitt stu-
dents enter the peach-colored room 212
of Wilkinsburg Junior/Senior High
School to tutor students there.

Across the room from Moreau,
sophomore Sarah Slinski discusses the
English project of a ninth-grader narued
Sapra. Sapra has to write a simpliﬁed
legal brief to bring Jack, the character
from “The Lord of the Flies,” to trial.

“What can you say about Jack.” asks
Slinski. “You told me he wasn’t a nice

guy. But what would a lawyer say about
him?”

“Well,” ponders Sapra, and then with
a giggle, “He was nuts.”

Slinski sighs.

“Okay, but how would you prove
that?” she asks. V

This is'Slinski’s second year at the
school tutoring through Pitt. - Like
Moreau she has no desire to be a teacher
but has always wanted to help children.

“It’s really enjoyable for me,” Slinski
said over the hum of rowdy students.

Vanessa Papalazaros has carted
tutors in the large white student volunteer
van from Pitt to Wilkinsburg everyday
for two years.

“Even if the kids never say it, I think
a tutor can see how they've helped them,
and I hope we’ve made some diﬁerences
in kids’ lives,” Papalazaros said.

Besides driving, Papalazaros coordi-
nates the tutoring program between Pitt
and the Hosanna House, an after-school
center for kids next to the Wilkinsburg
school, and sometimes gets involved in
the tutoring herself.

“These kids are wild, but they also
come to learn,” she said.

It takes the students several minutes
to settle down when tutors arrive. Some
dig through their backpacks, taking
extraordinary measures not to ﬁnd their
homework, others debate the merits of

Eventually, the 15 students who have
gathered in the room settle down, one or
two to a tutor, and begin to work, albeit

with some interruptions.

Outside the controlled chaos,

Wdkinsburg math teacher Joseph .

Newkirk, a tall man with a grating beard
and a pastel yellow sweater vest, checks
in on the progress. Newkirk serves as a
sort of unofﬁcial liaison between the stu-
dents and tutors. ‘

“I ﬁnd so many kids come into my
class unprepared,” Newkirk said. “So I
have to start at the very basics and show
themhowmathcanbeusedinthereal
worl .”

Newkirk praised the tutors for help-
ing move his students up to speed.

“I hope they can show [the students]
how math is useful and what they need to
be successful in the real world,” Newkirk
said.

Back in room 212, Pitt freshman
Carrie Pangbum and a seventh—grader
named Laneishi are tackling the task of
adding numbers with decimals.

‘‘You’re too good at this!” exclaims

Pangbum after Laneishi cruises through a '

problem. “Why am I even here?”
Laneishi runs. into difficulty when
the math problems are ﬂipped to horizon-
tal positions.

she hands Laneishi a sheet of scrap note-
book paper. As Laneishi rewrites the
problems, Pangbum checks over her

shoulder and makes sure she remembers J

to line up the decimal places correctly.

As the tutoring hour progresses, the
students become more restless.
Enthusiastic screaming erupts as several
students and tutors debate over state cap-
itals.

At last 4:30 p.m. rolls around and by
now the students can barely control their
eagerness to escape the hallowed halls of

academia. A whirlwind of bookbags, ,

notebooks and children ﬁle out of the
room. One student rushes off to find her
geography teacher‘ and show off her
improved knowledge of state capitals.
Several run and chase each other down
the hall. A couple actually thank the
tutors for their help.

As the tornado of students disappears
down the hallway, the tutors are left in the

dust, tired from the workout of junior.

high students.

    Pitt’s literaryoreview  

hosts poetry reading

MICHELLE SHIN
The Pitt News

Michaelangelo Monteleone stands
before a crowd of nearly 40 people in
the back room of HemingWay’S Cafe.

A thick‘ cloud of cigarette smoke
hangs in the air. There is not much noise
from the crowd except for a ﬂicker of a
ﬁghter, the striking of a match, or some-
one biting into the chips and pretzels
that lay on the table.

“Victor imagined great stone giants
seated and hunched over, their marn-
moth thumbs intertwined and clasped to
their bellies as they studied him intently,
and as he imagined this, he felt very,
very small,” Monteleone said.

Students who attended the Three
Rivers Review second Seasonal Release
Reading on the night of Oct. 11 heard
Monteleone and other writers read poet-
ry and fiction they and their friends had
written. ‘ '

The event‘ gave writers the opportu-
nity to read their,:.work, and also gave a
Voice to those writers who were not pub-
lished in the Spring 2000 edition of the
literary review. ‘

As Ian Douglas, editor of the Three
Rivers Review, explained, “The words
on the page are important, but the read-
.ing is an integral part.”

Some of those featured included 0

students Jerome Crooks,’ Marty
Mulligan, Brad ‘Coffield and Paul

- Siegell.

Those attending the reading heard
everything from a eulogy to a Buick
Skylark,_ to a look into what a cat’s life
might be like. i l i  '

The Three Rivers Review is a publi-
cation sponsored by the Honors College
that allows undergraduates — not just
from Pitt, but from any university inithe
area — the opportunity to get their work

V published in a literary magazine.

The editor’s notes from the review
said, “As always, this magazine has
done its utmost to bring you the very
best undergraduate writing to be found
in the city.” ‘

The Three Rivers Review worked
along with another organization that
allows undergraduates to read what they
wrote aloud.

The magazine is published once a
semester. This year’s magazine pub-
lished those writers who were chosen
last spring.

Those writers or aspiring ones have
a chance to get their work published in
this fall’s edition, which is expected to
be published in January.

The Three Rivers Review is accept-
ing undergraduates’ writing in poetry

and ﬁction until Oct. 24. The author of
the winning ﬁction entry, chosen by a
panel of judges, will be awarded $300.
The contest is open to all undergraduate
writers, regardless of experience or
qualiﬁcation.

After the reading last Wednesday,

Lisa Scheck said, “It almost makes me
think I can do it.”

For more information on the contest
or opportunities to hear students read
their work you can e—mail the Three
Rivers Review at crhst18+@pitt.edu.

Pitt writer wins $5,000

MARK TISDALE

The Pitt News

A constantly glowing computer
screen, a mug of cold coffee on a stack
of papers nearby, an empty box of
Chips Ahoy! cookies on the floor sur-
rounded by a pile of crumbs —— such is
the habitat of a busy ﬁction writer.

Keely Bowers‘ occupies such a
seemingly unsettled work space. A Pitt
creative writing instructor who recently

won the Nelson Algren award from the ‘
Chicago Tribune, complete with a‘

$5,000 prize, for her short story “A
Practice Life.”

The Chicago Tribune has spon-
soréd this award since 1986 in remem-
brance of Nelson Algren, a Chicago-
based writer famous for such books as
“Man With The Golden Arm,” now also
a film. Bowers was one of more than
750 writers to compete for the presti-
gious award.

A distinguished panel of judges
including Jean Thompson (author of
“Who Do You Love”) and R. Clark
(author of “River Cross My Heart,”
which made Oprah’s ‘ book club)
reviewed the stories for the contest.

Bowers has to ﬂash a smile when
she thinks back about winning the
grand prize in the competition.

“I was ﬂown out by the Tribune to

Chicago and put up in a great hotel.
There was an upscale awards dinner
with the CEOS of the Tribune present,”
she recalls. “I also had to give an accep-
tance speech in front of some award-
winning authors.” '

All that for aistory she had forgot-
ten to save a complete copy of; she sent
the original manuscript off to the
Tribune in the final days as the deadline
approached, but she was unsatisfied
with the story’s ending. Bowers imme-
diately began revising the manuscript,
trying out multiple endings, never per-
fectly satisfied with, any of them. It was
not until the story was printed in the
Sept. 24 Sunday edition of the Chicago
Tribune that Bowers was ﬁnally able to
read her story once again. Looking
back, she admits she made the right
choice with the original ending. The
judges agreed.

Wimiing awards, attending dinners
and meeting authors were great experi-
ences, Bowers admits, but for her writ-
ing is more than that. Writing is fulfill-
ing in and of itself, she feels. Bowers
said that she especially enjoys the feel-
ing when the characters are just right -

that they are moving through a story in

the right way, developing into what
they should be.

“There comes a time when you
know [the story] is good, it’s all coming
together. I like that part,” she said.

Monkeys and humans should be
wary of pot’s addictive qualities

It appears that Curious George
may be more curious than we imag-
ined. Not only is he getting into rnis—
chief as always, he’s been experiment-
ing with drugs lately, particularly pot.

A recent study by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse found that
squirrel monkeys repeatedly self-
administered THC, the main active
ingredient in marijuana. In fact, the
silly sirnians administered the drug
about as frequently as monkeys in
other studies have injected themselves
with cocaine. . A

While this does not automatically
mean that mary jane is as addictive as
nose candy, it does suggest that reefer
has addictive qualities, at-least for the
species of swingers used in the study.

While monkeys are our closest
relatives, they are different enough
from us that most things they do are
rendered inherently funny. The
thought of a high monkey — and not
high in the “soaring through the tree-
tops” sense — is most deﬁnitely
amusing. The monkey is, of course, in
a clinical setting; he’s getting injec-
tions of THC by pressing a lever, not
smoking a joint while listening to Bob
Marley or consuming “special”
brownies. But it’s a funny mental
image nonetheless. ‘

Animal rights activists may not
ﬁnd the idea of monkeys on drugs so

humorous. Indeed it does seem cruel

to take monkeys from their natural

habitat and breed them to be potheads.
But as far as animal testing goes, a

monkey can’t really get anyluckier. A - -

lab monkey’s ‘days are squandered
away in a small cage, his time most
likely devoid of fun, excitement or
even random tasks to keep him busy;
he might as well enjoy a little herbal
pleasure. It deﬁnitely beats having his
brains spliced in the name of science.

Lonely Weed . ﬁends may be
tempted to take advantage of the situ-
ation and ‘start acquiring squirrel mon-
keys as pets. Such monkeys would
make ideal bud-smoking. buddies,
always up for high times when other
friends are busy, unavailab1e.or jailed
for dealing. _

As intriguing and amusing as it is
to realize that monkeys as well as
Monkees like to get stoned, the squir-

rel monkey study should carry with it .

a serious and important message for
all ganja connoisseurs. It is a popular
rumor that grass is not as dangerous as
other drugs, because it is supposedly

not addictive. Monkeys, let it be-

repeated, are not that diﬁerent ﬁom
us. If they can get addicted, so can
you. Tempted as you may be to get
high as the forest canopy, think twice

before becoming another pothead pri- ‘

mate.

Higher education is a brutal game

As a student at this institution, you are part ,

of a herd of cattle. Having made the initial cut
and paying your tuition, you enter — along with
the rest of the herd —— excited about the prospect
of a glorious future. Whether you were initially

fed volumes of positive propaganda or someone ~

tried to scare you silly in regard to the ‘rigors of
college, you knew there was something in it for
you. Though having some preconception of such
a truth, you probably failed ‘to realize to what
extent college is a battleground that pits you in
guenilla warfare against all. ' V

The University tries hard to foster a sense of
community, but by mere virtue of it being such a
large campus, the irnpersonality of the game is

a few incidents in which you felt as A
if you were just another one of the
cows. You probably felt dehuman-
ized or limited, like a mere’ statis-
tic. Your identity is deﬁned more ‘ 
by your Social Security Number or your grades
rather than by your name or personality.

As the semesters pass, you  familiar faces
fade away without ever ' receiving the coveted
diploma All the extraneous ﬂuff is gone by now,

A right? Perhaps, but the competition only intensi-

ﬁes. Making the cut and truly enduring the race

into submission in hopes to have anupper edge
in your intended career or pursuit of further strid-
res.

Paradoxically, as you get closer to graduat-
ing, the unity of those within your major or inter-
est group increases while the rabid competition

- becomes overt Though honestly taking pride as

your classmates garner the respect of tire acade-
mic community, you secreﬂy envy them. Even
your teachers and professors, especially the
young ones without tenure or a respected name,
become your enemies. You may be the next indi-

Don’t squandieriiiiiour 

vote on Bush or Gore

' Face it: you’ve had enoughppof this
presidential election gnonsenseli ‘Many
people began ignoring it long ago, con-V
cluding quite reasonably that it  little
to do with them, and- even though you’re
still paying attention, you’re starting to
get that same sneaking suspicion.

Consider: Gov. George W. Bush has
a silver spoon so deeply lodged in his
throat that it is a wonder he is not con-
stantly hocking up gobs of his blue
blood. . ,

Perhaps he did his share of bloodlet—
ting via the nose during his
days as a coke-snorting play-

JoHN

stop our 1 self-appointed
guardians of “virtue” from
making the laughable con— . 
tention that Bush meets even their own
depraved standards of moral rectitude.
Such is the prerogative of the of
breeding. Local millionaire  ‘Elsie

Hillman (you occasionally check books I

out of the library that bears herfarnily

name), who is active in Republican party, i

circles, has dropped the gossip that
Laura Bush can  credited;.with a
domesticating inﬂuence on her ‘husband.
Having sown his wild’ oats, he now

embraces familial piety, or atleast pass- 

ably feigns as much. ~ r .
We could note that men of duskier

hue and/or smaller bank accounts might

have done a stint in prison for George the
Younger’s “youthful indiscrevtions/1.7’ But
that’s not the point, or at _least it‘ be,
because otherwise you might accuse me
of fomenting class warfare.

No, the point is that Bush is a faitl1— A

ful, if painfully dull, automaton for the
corporate interests he serves. Despite his
paucity of functional neurons, he does
have the ability to read a TelePrompTer,
and while he slips up occasionally, his
handlers must give him enough practice

sounding out the words so that he gets by '

most of the time.

Furthermore, his script -- is always
straightforward. At some point, he pla-
cates the ﬁrearms enthusiasts and fetus-
rights advocates that form his electoral
base; then he attends to matters nearer
and dearer to his own heart and the
hearts of his peers. Needless to say,
repealing the estate tax is something that.
Bush himself can relate to; it "seems to
bring a smile to his face even before the
cue—card prompts of his handlers.

When Bush gets his lines right —
roughly, “Nationalize the uterus; priva-
tize everything else” —- he provokes the

‘kind of applause that would please any-

one with the mentality of an actor in a
junior high play. At times like these he
must be thrilled at receiving the perks
afforded a senior member of tlie=exec1_1-
tive committee of the ruling class. ‘a '-

On the other hand you may have
been thrilled aboutiyice ‘President Al
Gore’s convention rhetoﬁc about “the
people and the powerful.” Gore has

described the Bush-Cheney candidacy as ' g I

the “Big Oil ticket,”1 whiéh is true,
although from such talk you would never
know that the Gore family has long held
substantial investments in."?fOccidental
Petroleum. 4

Occidental is currently engaged in
despoiling the ancestral home of the
U’wa people of Colombia, a fact that has
provoked‘ nary a peep of
protest from the putative
environmentalist Gore. The
company“: also won substan-
tial concessions in the U.S.
Naval oil -reserves once the
Clinton-Gore administration opened

them up for drilling  the largest priva— » ’

tization in American history.
Gore’s commercials assail Bush for

the fact that Texas has’ the worst air qual-‘ . C

ity in the country. This leaves out the
inconvenient truth that much of that

state’s air pollutionrg’:come§§.. from the 

, exploitative maquiladora  industries“
along the qMexican" border, , which ,0

received their greatest hnpetigs as a result 
of the ‘North American “Free Trade - ’
Agreement so enthusiastically backed by

Gore.

, On race Gore is anoted opportunist.)
', During his time in the Senate, Gore’s ,
father, Al Sr., at. least; had the gumption‘ 
to refuse to  the is-“Southern- 
Manifesto” of segregationist Strom" 

Thurmond. Gore Jr. has shown no simi-
lar scruples, as was evidenced by his
introduction of the “Willie Horton” issue
into the 1988 ‘presidential race —- a bit of
shameless race—baiting that was soon
employed by George the Elder to telling
effect. -

On the Middle East and on the mili-
tary—industrial complex Gore is, if any-
thing, even more servile to the Israeli
rejectionists and to the arms merchants,
respectively. Not only is Gore’s nmning
mate Joseph Lieberman in the pocket of
Connecticut military contractors, but

Gore has actually attacked Bush from the .

right on the issue of nuclear arms con-
trol. 1
So there you have it —— more proof
that politics is far too serious a matter to
be left to the politicians. Even the limit-
ed possibilities for political change
offered by the ‘vote should not be taken
lightly. Thousands, even millions, of
people have laid down their lives for it,
even in our lifetime. Do you really relish
the thought of throwing your vote away

whole college experience, from
“Leaving Home Unscathed” to
job—searching after graduation.
She addresses most of the major
issues of the transition between
high school and college. At the
end of the section on drug and
alcohol abuse she lists contact
information for assistance orga-
nizations. She also touches on
the issues of anorexia and bulim-
ia, as well as safe sex.

However, the advice she offers
is often bland and not very prac-
tical or wise. For the most part,
her suggestions do not reach
beyond common sense.

For instance, say you are feel-
ing lonely and having a hard time
meeting people at school. Dr.‘
Ruth suggests that, instead of
staying in your room all the time,
you join activities and clubs to
meet other people with similar
interests. Her advice‘ is really
nothing more than what anyone
with any sort of logic would fig-
ure out for themselves. Even her
case studies, the examples which

esting, are fairly generic. One
- girl complains about having a
hard time meeting people outside
her sorority; Dr. Ruth has the
insight to suggest she try going
_ out one night without her sisters.
Although her advice may not be
earth-shattering, the book is occasionally
entertaining. My favorite chapter was”The
Dating Scene,” where Dr. Ruth offers 16 tips
on how to avoid what she calls “the wallﬂower
syndrome.” Although some of her nuggets of
wisdom, such as practicing introducing your-
self to people in front of a mirror, or simply
walking up to someone and saying “hi,” are
, amusing, I don’t think you really want to scam
pick-up lines from a woman ‘old enough to be
your grandmother. ’ i
G In the end, Dr. Ruth’s advice is well-meant
but not very helpful. She really doesn’t provide
any particularly valuable informa-
tion or suggestions. If you
are already in college or
were paying any atten-
tion when the kids _from

of hair wax as well. .

So, in honor of the age-old tradition of road tripping, here are
my top ﬁve albums to listen to whilst driving six or seven hours
ridingbitch: ~ ‘

5. Guns N’ Roses  Appetite for Destruction. This album is

the perfect wind-up for pesky parkway trafﬁc during rush hour,
T especially its opening track, “Welcome to the Jungle.” Oh Axl!

4. Radiohead — The Bends. If you have the room, I recom-
mend bringing the entire Radiohead ouvre, but if you’re cramped
on space The Bends will serve you just ﬁne between the hours of
6 and 7 p.m., just as it’s starting to get dark.

3. Ben Folds Five —- Naked Baby Photos. With tracks like
“Satan is My Master,” and their cover of Built to Spi1l’s “Twin
Falls Idaho,” Naked Baby Photos is not only packed with rare

live tracks, but a lot of really fumiy spoken word comments —

before and after each song.

2. Def Leppard — Hysteria. This album shaped my elemen-
tary school years — it deserves to be listened to in the dark, with
the occasional street light creating a strobe effect inside the car.

1. Madonna —— Pick any and all of Madonna’s super hits
(except for Music) and play sporadically to wake up the driver
and spur conversations about the myriad of images that Madonna
has created over the past two decades.

One last thought, and I can’t stress this enough —— movie
soundtracks are one of the best accompaniments to any drive.
Aside from the variety, you don’t feel the guilt of skipping over
track ﬁve like you might if you were listening to your favorite
band’s album.

The semester is starting to wane, boys and girls. It’s time to

load up and haul ass — I promise that nothing will go wrong if «

you have the perfect soundtrack and destination in mind, and
bring some bungee cords, just in case.

Exorcised  

“Lost Souls”

Directed by J anusz
Karninski

it

OLIVER B. JOHNSON III
' Staff Writer 1

Hollywood has a philosophy:
Milk it ‘til the well runs dry.

With the coming and going of
the millennium, Hollywood gave us
an onslaught of biblical suspense
movies. “Lost Souls” was
scheduled for a 1999
release, with the
likes of
“Stigmata,” “End
of Days,” and
“The Ninth
Gate,” to name a
few. 

Strangely, it was- - '-

n’t until. last weekend that
“Lost Souls” hit the theaters. This
is normally a bad sign; studios have
been known to holdback “iffy”
movies for quiet weekend releases.
This would be the second time this
year for a Winona Ryder movie;
“Autumn in New York” was
delayed as well.

“Lost Souls” has the customary
plot of a biblical narrative. Maya
Larkin (Winona Ryder), the tor-
mented soul, and Father Lareaux

(John Hurt) start the movie with a .

routine exorcism on a serial killer.
During the process, Father Lareaux
is put out of commission, a la “The
Exorcist.” . .

Maya then finds .out that none
other than the Anti-Christ himself
has possessed the body of non-

believer," Peter Kelson (Ben
Chaplin), following the botched
rites. It would appear that Peter’s

' body would act as a doorway for

Satan to get into our world. Maya
was once possessed — that’s why
she knows so much about this stuff.

I On the outside, this movie is

just one big buildup of suspense,
with an ending that doesn’t really
deliver,.but — and this. is a big but
—~— this isn’t a bad movie. It man-
aged to break the mold in ways that

' kept me satisfied. The most noted

difference between this and the

other cropping of biblical suspense»

films is seen right away with the
cinematography.

The movie is faded with a dull 1

green tint. This could be seen
solely as a cosmetic

I 1 effect, however, the
-coloring had a
way of keeping
the viewers from
getting too deep

into the film’s
“reality,” a sort of
buffer zone that

allows them to keep an objec-
tive stance. I

Co-stars Ryder and Chaplin
have good on-screen chemistry. The
role of Maya seemed handcrafted
for Rider ——- she plays the introvert-
ed lunatic like no other. Chaplin
does a nice job with the dogmatic,
logical minded psychologist, as
well.

This movie is not only a fight
between good and evil, but also
between science and religion, even
touching on the fights within the
institutions themselves. Still it does
have its drawbacks —— films like
this take a very understanding type
of viewer. The premise of suspense
is building up the “boom,” and
“Lost Souls” lacks the expected
boom.  .

Bostonllge psets  
Pitt in mn’ssoeer, 1-

MATT MILOSZEWSKI

Staff Writer

The No.7 Pitt men’s soccer
team lost on Sunday to Boston:
College, 1-0, in Chestnut Hill,
Mass., snapping the team’s five-
game winning streak.

“We played all right,” freshman
defender Clay Haflich said. “But
not well enough to win.”

The lone goal of the game
occurred with just over 28 minutes
left. BC sophomore forward Casey
Schmidt took a pass from Adam
Pfeifer and put it past Pitt goalie
Justin Gaul. _

Pittrhad its chances, but the
Boston College offense dominated
the game. The Eagles outshot Pitt
28-10. Pfeifer led BC in shots with
five. Pitt was led by Ben Garry’s
three shots. Gaul had five saves,
the same number as BC goalie
Chris Hamblin.

Pitt is now 11-2 on the year, 5-
2 in the Big East Conference.

Harris announces that Turman will
start for the remainder of the season

BRIAN GOLDMAN

Staff Writer

Once again, the main topic at Pitt head coach
Walt Harris’ weekly press conference was the quar-
terback controversy. However, the controversy was
put to rest yesterday when Harris announced his
starting quarterback for this week’s Boston College
game and for the rest of the season.

“I am naming John Turman our starter, not just
for this game,” Harris said. “But I also reserve the
right to make a change, [to] bring in a relief pitch-
er.”

The starting quarterback position has been an
issue since before the season started. The first two
games of the season saw both Turman and David
Priestley get equal playing time. Since the Penn
State game, Turman has been getting more of the
playing time. Harris made his final decision after the

Syracuse game two weeks ago. i 2

“John has done a nice job in a lot of areas,”
Harris said. “The most important area is handling
the way I went about doing it [the game plan]. He
has worked hard to get better. He showed physical
toughness [against Syracuse].”

Harris had not informed Turman of his decision
when he told the media yesterday. .-

“I haven’t told John yet,” Harris said. “We prac-
tice that way though. I wanted to see him again.”

Now that the players know who will be their
starting quarterback, they can practice more with
Turman and build more confidence in him.

“I think it [starting Turman] affects us a little
bit,” said_Pitt starting center Jeff McCur1ey. “I think
he runs the huddle real well. I have a lot of confi-
dence whenever [Turman] is in there-."’

Pitt volleyball head coach Chris
Beerman did not expect to lose this week-
end when the Panthers went to Springfield,

Mo., for the Johansen Group—Dr. Mary Jo 1

Wynn Invitational hosted by Southwest
Missouri State.

E The Panthers wanted to continue their
previous domination of non-conference
tournaments. But, Beerman said, the team
seemed tired and he eventually wondered
why he didn’t schedule this as a bye week
after a mid-week fmatchup against St.

Francis.

In spite of the possible overload of
games this week, Pitt won it’s first match
against Belmont 3-O. Pitt then lost to both
Wichita State and [Southwest Missouri
State 1-3. Pitt finished third in the invita-
tional.

Pitt vs. Belmont

Stacy Renick led the team with six
aces, 13 kills and five digs. Marcia
Thiesen had a "double-double with 10 kills
and 10 digs. , 1

And Wendy Hatlestad, the 6-foot-3-
inch freshman, had nine kills out of 15
attempts. Pitt swept the.Bruins by scores
of 15-7, 15-5 and 15-2.

“Wendy -Hatlestad really stood out,”
Beennan said. ~ 

Everyone _ on the team contributed in
this match. The team attack percentage of
.299 and seven team blocks led to a win as
the team rose to 16-6 for the season.

_ Pitt vs. Wichita State

Pitt lost the match against Wichita
State in four games by the scores of 11-15,
10-15, 15-8, 15-13. Wichita State entered
the match with a 2-15 record.

“We just‘ didn’t compete hard,”
Beerman said of the loss.

The team was led by Thiesen who had
20 kills and 14 digs for her second double-
double‘ of the tournament. Renick also had
a double-double with 19 kills and 13 digs.
Carrie Norris had 56 assists and two aces
along with 12 digs for her double-double.
Jen Nickels had 14 killsalongwith two
kills and five block assists. ‘

The team combined for 14 blocks and V

59 digs before dropping the match to
Wichita State in an hour and 50 minutes.

wouldeasgsubway series begood forbaseball?

Well, it’ looks veréy much as though
the baseball [world 1Iiay..‘see a Subway
Series, Ofcourse the idea excites Mets
and Yankees fans, -but the question
ﬂoating around seems to be: Would a
Subway Series be good or bad for
baseball? I

A couple of nights ago I happened

to catch the last 10 minutes or so of —

“The Last Word with Jim Rome.”
Now, I never watch this
show, but as I ﬂipped 
through the channels, it

was this exact issue that

was being debated.

The panel was comprised

of two sports columnists, one

from San Francisco and one

from Denver (whose names I

can’t remember at this 
point), and former major

league pitcher Roger
McDowell.

One would hope that

these columnists would be at least
somewhat intelligent, but some of the
remarks they made in an attempt to
bash the Subway Series were just plain

, idiotic.

One went so far as to bash
McDowell, calling him slow.

McDowell, however, was the one
who came away looking the smartest.
He maintained his composure despite
the childish name—calling and made
some very valid points in defense of a

Subway Series being beneficial to the I

game. — . —
Perhaps the columnist from San
Francisco is just bitter, because the
Giants were knocked out of the play-
offs by the Mets, and perhaps the
columnist from Denver is bitter,
because the Rockies never had a
chance. But whatever the reason, I do
not find their arguments concrete.
The most stressed
 issue was that the World
Series needs to be played in

Among the reasoning was that
New York fans are negative
and criticize their teams, and
make signs just‘ to get on
television.

As McDowell argued,
‘ if baseball wants to have
' V the World Series played in
a two diverse cities, then
- why not just pick‘ two
teams to play? Why even bother play-
ing the season? The purpose is tolpit
the two best teams in baseball against
each other. It just so happens that this

year the two best teams may both be o

from N ew' York. - -

And yes, both Mets and Yankees
fans are known tobe vocal, butswhat

people can_honestly say _that they were

fans in Seattle or: St. Louis or any-
where else saints? It’s highly doubtful.

And since when is it a crime to
have a fan base, as these teams do?
Fans all over the country display signs
and banners at games, but of course,
New Yorkers do it to get on television.
How ridiculous.

There is incessant complaining
about the New York teams doing well
because they have the money to buy
the big—name players. Well, the Mets
outﬁeld of Time Perez, J ay Payton and
Benny Agbayani combined make less
than $1 million, compared to the aver-
age major league salary of $1.9 mil-
lion a player. This is a team that relies
a lot on talent, and the impact these
three players have made throughout
the playoffs is an example that money
isn’t everything.

The bottom line is that every base-
ball fan should, be intrigued by the
possibility of a Subway Series simply
because it would be a highly competi-
tive matchup. People can argue all
they want that it would be bad for the
game of baseball, but the fact is, these
teams are good. And the fact that they
hate each other only adds to the inten-
sity. ‘  '

Pitt vs. Southwest Missouri State

Pitt lost the match against the
Bears 1-3 and dropped to 16-8 over-
all and placed third in the tourna-
ment. The Bears won by the scores of
15-7, 14-16, 15-3 and 15-13 to beat
Pitt and take first.

Renick, Thiesen and Norris all
registered double-doubles. Lisa
Riggle, Heather Haff, Megan Miller
and Dionne Hayden also contributed
to the pool of 12 blocks and 82 kills.
Hatlestad had 18 kills for a new per-
sonal best and Norris had her best
game of the weekend with 66 sets.

Before this match these two
teams hadn’t met in over a decade
and Beerman isn’t sure if he will
schedule the tournament again next
year. The idea of non—conference
competition in the middle of the sea-
son may not continue as Beerman
looks for a different way to maintain
focus and concentration without the
physical exertion necessary for tour-
nament play.

“No more easy matches this sea-
son. This team has got to want it,”
Beerman said of the rest of the
schedule. “We control our own des-

the quarterback issue, there was a
football game to discuss.

Saturday, Pitt will take on Big

East rival Boston College. Last

year Pitt lost in a heartbreaker 20-

16 at Alumni Stadium. Pitt hopes to
get some revenge for last year’s
loss. '

“The Boston College game last
year was a game we thought we had
a chance-[to win], but they made
the plays when they had to,” Harris
said. “They had a huge ‘victory last

‘week over Syracuse, now it’s up to

us to get back to play what we do,
which is play Pitt football.”

Even though Boston College
defeated the same team Pitt lost to
two weeks ago, Boston Col1ege’s
coach Tom O’Brien isn’t taking th
Panthers lightly. ’

“They are 5 more experienced.
They have the same quarterback as
last year and they are much more
efficient,”.O’Brien said about Pitt’s
offense. The defense moved more
people. around. They are blitzing
and gambling and Ramon Walker at
safety makes up for any mistakes
on defense.” A

Walker agreed with the BC head
coach’s assertion about the Pitt
defense’s improvement since last

' season.

“Our defense is much better,
and our attitude‘ is better,” Walker
said.

Saturday’s game with Boston
College at Three Rivers Stadium
will kick off at noon. It will be tele-
vised by ESPN Regional, and can
be seen locally on WTAE-TV.

 f   AFROM Pace 12 ‘H

Boston College is 6-5-1 on the sea-
son, and 4-2-1 in the league. The
win was BC’s second straight
strong showing against a highly-
ranked team. Earlier in the week,

the Eagles tied No. .1 Connecticut, ..

1-1.

‘_Pitt now will concentrate on
winning thevconference champi-
onship. Forward Spencer Barton
and midfielder Nate Montgomery
returned from injury to play in the
game against Boston "College, and
they will be used prominently as
Pitt attempts to win the Big,East.

If the Panthers ‘win their

against Rutgers’, Villanova and
Syracuse, they will be the Big East
champions. V ‘T »

  This recruitment

for Pill-Islwrglt Post-Guzelﬂe

You can’t read a copy of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
without also reading what used to be The Pitt News. So
many P-G writers and editors began their careers at
Pitt’s student newspaper that you could practically
combine Homecoming with a P-G staff meeting.

Well, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration. But
decide for yourself: Matt Kennedy ‘77, editor in chief
back then, assistant managing editor now; Pohla Smith
‘71, news editor then, sports writer now; Tom
Waseleski ‘77, editor in chief then, associate editor
now; Susan Mannella, ‘76, copy editor back then,
associate editor for news now; Steve Sybert ‘7 6, sports

. editor back then, copy editor now; Bob Smizik ‘65,'
_ associate editor back then, sports columnist now.

So don’t let your student life be rated “R” for

V i “regret.” Come work for The Pitt News and begin what

could become a major metropolitan daily career.
