Defy: n g convention  
Pitt graduates create ‘Souf    
Oaklin fo’ Life’ spoof paper

MELISSA MEINZER
0 The Pitt News

If you actually place your garbage in a
garbage can on trash. day, own a car worth
more than $1,500 or get back your security
deposit on your apartment, you are not wor-
thy of South Oakland. .

This is the opinion of the newest author-
ity on all things South Oakland, the altema—
tive paper Souf Oaklin fo’ Life.

The satirical newspaper is the brainchild
of Pitt graduates Marc Wisnosky, Alex Dow,
Kelly Crawshaw and longtime Oakland res—

‘ ident Tom Stilley. Inspired by other altema—

tive papers such as Denver’s The Onion and
Pittsburgh’s The Go—Go, SOFL is “a labor of
love,” according to Wrsnosky. "

It began in June 2000 as a way for the

writers to keep in touch with each other and '

the goings—on in Oakland after graduating.
. At ﬁrst the publication consisted only of
stapled, photocopied sheets ﬁlled with inside

jokes. At a launch party about twoiweeks
ago, the publishers handed out 200 copies of L

the paper in its current eight-page newsprint
format.
Begun as a group of friends meeting

casually at The Second Plate in Posvar Hall,

- North Oakland and Gooski’s in the North

, the paper itself. The publisher’s note claims

the publishing staff of SOFL has grown to
include copy editors, content editors and a
layout Specialist.

The paper comes out about every six
weeks and is distributed in bars such as
Denny’s in South Oakland, ThirSty’s in

Side. Mellinger’s, a beer distributor in South
Oakland, also carries the paper. Wisnosky
said the publishers encountered some difﬁ—
culty in getting businesses to cany the paper
because of its controversial content.

Articles are printed anonymously, as is

Tom Stilley, a 1978 graduate of Pitt, as the
publisher. According to Wisnosky, Stilley is
actually more of an opinionated ﬁgurehead. ‘
The photograph in the paper of Stilley is
actually a modiﬁed photo of VV1snosky.

“[1-Ie is] a symbol of everything beauti-
ful about SOFL,” VV1snosky said.

The publishers all lived in South
Oakland as undergraduates. Despite partying
hard, they all graduated with -honors. .

“Our hearts are in Oakland,” VV1snosky
said.

When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat,

Graetz, who is white, took over an all-black
congregation in Montgomery, Ala., late in 1955.
Little did he know that one month later he would
be an integral part of the most famous bus boycott
in history.

On Tuesday night, he came to Carnegie Mellon
University’s McConomy auditorium to share his
experience with students from Pitt and CMU.

“I drove the streets, back and forth, Seeing

Graetz spoke to an audience of students active

Graetz congratulated the students on being the
first college in the United States to speak out
against the United States ﬁghting in Afghanistan,
and offered words of wisdom from his experience
as an activist. . _ ’

“Our real enemy is untruth and injustice,”
Graetz said. “Our adversaries are those who are
caught up_in the untruth and injustice.” _

Graetz, whose grandson Jared is a student at
CMU, is a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran
Church of America. He spoke at length about the
spiritual implications of attempting to change
minds through peaceful means.

Fraternity won’t go
home until members

REBECCA HUDOCK
Staff Writer

It’s 9 a.m. and Chad Keefer is
keeping vigil in front of an
American flag outside the William
Pitt Union.

He’s been there for two hours.

“One of the brothers called me
early this morning and asked if I
could find someone to take his
place,” Keefer said. “I just rolled out
of bed and told him I would be there
in a few minutes.”

Keefer and 69 other Pi Kappa
Alpha brothers have been holding a
flag vigil 24 hours a day since
Monday at 11 a.m. And according to
Keefer, they will continue to do so
until they raise $5,000, which will
be donated to the American Red
Cross’ relief effort to aid victims of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

The idea to raise money began
almost 2 1/2 weeks ago and stemmed
from an ,.e—mail received over the fra-
ternity’s national distribution list.

“A brother in another  chapter
lost his dad and an uncle in the
attacks,” said fraternity member
Greg Wilson. “They asked for help
and we decided to do something.”

The brothers are also trying to
make a good impression for their
generation.

“It’s a testament to our time,”
said Beau Kegler, the fraternity’s
public relations chair. “Our brothers
are willing to make a small sacrifice
for a larger principle, and the every
man’s quarter reinforces that every
little bit does indeed help.”

The fraternity‘ discussed ideas
for raising money at its recent chap-
ter meeting, like collecting dona-
tions in cans and Dare to Care,
where students dare brothers to do
something for a donation.

“There were only a few ideas,”
Keefer said. “We’re frat guys, we’re
not supposed to be creative. All we
know is, we go out, we collect
money and we donate it.”

The idea for the vigil came from.

a Pi Kappa Alpha alumnus.

“[He] heard that a chapter in
Virginia had held on and collected
almost $10,000,” said Rocco
Pacella, community service and
philanthropy chair.

After receiving permission from
the University, the brothers took up

raise $5,000  

Members of Pi Kappa Alpha plan to
man this table in front of the William
Pitt Union until they raise $5,000.

their vigil on the Fifth Avenue side
of the Union.

“When we first started we didn’t
have an official box so we just used
a big pretzel jug,” Mark Wong said.

Since acquiring the official Red
Cross collection box, many brothers
have noticed various nuances about
theart of soliciting.

“Lunchtime is really good for

collecting because of the amount of
people,” Wong said. “But between
classes is even better because you
can speak one—on—one to passersby
and let them know what you’re
doing.”

The brothers also benefited from
their location next to a booth con-
ducting psychology experiments on
the second day of the vigil.

“Everyone who participated in
the study got paid $3. A lot of stu-
dents then turned around and gave
the money to us,” Keefer said.

But not all students were equally
willing to ante up their hard-earned
dollars.

“Guys seem to be more willing
to donate money than girls. Maybe
they think a girl will see-them and
think they’re the sensitive type,”
Keefer said.

But since the start of the vigil,
the fraternity has collected a little
more than $1,000.

  ‘The University Responds’  
withcounseling, support U

CHIRAG DEVASKAR
The Pitt News

Students seeking ways to help the
nation heal from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks shorddflooki‘ no  than the
WilliamPitt' R ’ - ' . ‘

From 10 agmi to 5:30 pm. today, inwthe
lower level offtlre Union, the ‘University
will host a group of support organizations
gathered to help and educate students in the
wake of the attacks. " '

Among the organizations represented
are Allegheny County Department. of
Human Resources, American Red Cross,
Catholic Charities Diocese of Pittsburgh,
Center for Race Relations, Parental Stress

. Center, Salvation Army, United Way and

YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh.
Joe Dralmak of the United Way of
New York said after the attacks occurred,

these groups joined to provide an irrforrna-

tion session for students. The Salvation

Army is collecting money for the United .

Way of New‘ York in local businesses.
Students can also mail a donation. ’

“One hundred percent of the money
goes to the United Way of New York, and
87 percent of that will be distributed to the

, Various organizations,” Drahnak said.

Racial relations,have been an impor-
tant issue recently as well, speciﬁcally with
people who appear "to be of Arabic descent.
But Diane Hernon Chavis, director of the
YWCA Center for Race Relations and
Anti-Racism Training, pointed out that
racial issues are not unique to this time. The
YWCA brings people of diﬂerent races
together to discuss the issue as well as ways
of undoing racism and training anti—oppres-
sron.

“We want people to think of everyone

as the same and not divide them into racial
groups,” Chavis said, citing that Penn State
University’s minority students have
received death threats and hate mail.

The Allegheny County Department of
Human Resources also provides help for
people unrelated to the national tragedy.
The department provides assistance in heal-
ing after disasters, speciﬁcally for those
who lost a relative or friend.

“A lot of people need help getting over
a major crisis such as what happened in
New Yor ” said Lucille Underwood, who
is representing the department.

The group has several hotlines set up
for both adults and children, and it also pro-
vides pamphlets containing effective ways
to deal with a disaster.

Joyce Duriga of Catholic Charities
echoes Underwood’s sentiments. Like the
Department of Human Resources, Catholic

Charities provides information on coping _

in the Wake of the attacks.

- While the events in New York,
Washington and Somerset County, Pa.,
provided the inspiration for organizing this
gathering, the organizations emphasized
that their availability to help in these mat-
ters for reasons other than the terrorist
attacks.

Parental Stress Center is not directly
related to the attacks but provides infonr1a-
tion some students may ﬁnd helpful. The
center’s primary goal is to provide educa-
tion to help prevent child abuse.

In addition to gaining infomration on
these matters and making ﬁnancial contri-
butions, students interested can also volun-
teer to work with some of the organiza-

‘ -tions, including the Salvation Army and the

Allegheny County Department of Human
Resources when they visit.

Speaker battles evil with love

Peace, page 1

“The only thing that we can do to
battle the evil we are ﬁghting against is
use the power of love,” he said. “What
you do must be done with discipline and
determination to do it lovingly and non-
violently.’’ ‘ _

During a talkback session, Graetz
responded to questions about the current
war on terrorism.

“It’s appropriate to track down
someone who may be a criminal. But it
matters how you do it,” he said. “It
doesn’t make sense to drag the whole
world into war for the purpose of catch-
ing one man  The caring, loving cre-

ator did not put us here to go and bomb _

the hell out of Afghanistan.”
He also spoke of a longer-terrn solu-

tion to terrorism-

“You can’t destroy all the terror-
ists,” he said. “You can change the con-
ditions in the world that breed terror-
ism.”

Graetz made references throughout
his talk to leaders such as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Ghandi
as people who were willing to endure
what he called “voluntary sacriﬁce,”
which he said was a part of any
activism. He spoke about the civil rights
movement and “the realization that
some of us were going to die.”

Graetz, who has been imprisoned
three times for various protests, has not
given up his drive for activism.

“It’s unpatriotic not to be a citizen P

who speaks up and tells the truth,” he
said. — ' ,

Resident Student Association
retreat prepares students to lead

TARA SUTTON
The Pitt News

In a bonding teamwork exercise
designed to prepare them for a year as
building presidents for the Resident
Students Association, a van -load of Pitt
students spent last weekend at Seven
Springs.

Every year, the RSA executive board,
made up of newly elected RSA presidents,
the chairperson and the RSA adviser, go
on a retreat to elect positions and discuss
the agenda for the upcoming year. In the
past, these excursions have consisted of a
one-night stay at a local hotel. This year
was a little different.

Michele Grifﬁth, the RSA adviser,
transformed ﬂre simple overnight retreat
into a weekend of team building activities.
She decided to take the group to Seven
Springs for Tearnbuilding College

‘Excursions. These activities work to

strengthen skills such as leadership, team-
work and cooperation.

“Going someplace, staying two-nights
and participating in the ropes course was
the best thing we could have done,”
Griffith said.

The students participated in many low
element and high element challenges, test-
ing their strength as a group.

One such challenge, and perhaps the
most inﬂuential one for the group, was the
15-foot wall. The group had to ﬁnd a way
to get everyone over the wall without the
use of ropes. Although they were allowed
a maximum of three people at the top, the

RSA executive board got everyone over
using only two.

“I was very proud of them,” Grifﬁth
said. “After they did the wall they knew
they could do everything together.”

The board also elected officers, dis-
cussed the budget and set goals for the
upcoming year. _

One of the upcoming events is the
Heinz 57 Bus, which, in conjunction with

the athletic department and the Heinz‘

Corp., gives students a’ chance to tailgate
before the football games. RSA will be in
charge of the ﬁrst Heinz 57 Bus on home-
coming weekend.

RSA is also holding a non-alcoholic
mixer on the Towers patio tomorrow
night, and plans for the Holland Haunted
House and Nightmare in the Quad are

. already under way.

The weekend wasn’t all business. The
group stayed up all night Friday, talking
and playing cards.

“I made them go to bed at 3:30 a.m.,”

A Griﬁth said. On Saturday they went on a

hayride and went bowling.

The group exchanged e-mails as soon
as they returned to Pitt on Sunday.

‘‘I am sohappy to be part of such an
enthusiastic, determined and supportive
group,” said Kristin Kelly, president of the

“Let me add that this weekend was a
blast and I’m really excited for what we
can get done this year,” wrote Felix
Yerace, president of Tower C. _

Grifﬁth said, “One word to sum it up
— awesome.”

don’t worry about being sued for libel or

defamation because the paper is clearly satir- _

ical. He said it'would be hard to ﬁnd a read-

the opening of the new “Petersen Crack
House.” .

Wrsnosky said the publishers see them-

 selves as equal opportunity offenders.

“We’re not trying to point ﬁngers,” he
said “[We try to] spoof in a way people are
going to enjoy.”

According to Wrsnosky, the paper’s
publishers hope that everyone —— including
Nordenberg — will read the paper. One
writer claims to have put a copy in

Get some culture in your life

It’s Oct. 4 — six weeks into classes.
By now, you’ve probably had some
midterms. Freshmen and anyone else
new to Oakland have likely already
mastered what’s here and what’s not.

You know about the Original Hot
Dog Shop, you know about Hillman
Library, you know about Schenley Park
(at least we hope you do by now, as it’s
456 acres of green space right by cam-
pus). You know about Dave and Andy’s.

And you should also know by now
about using your ID as a bus pass. The
time has come for you to go out and
about and explore Pittsburgh. The
University has made that easier for you.

Did you realize that Pitt Arts allows
you to see plays, the symphony, the
opera and even art exhibit openings, all
for free? You still must go in your suits
and dresses, but you don’t even have to
be rich.

And even when Pitt Arts can’t offer
free seats to these events, it can at least
offer cheap seats. Often for $10 per
ticket, you can go to events that would
normally cost more than $50. Once
again, you can feel like one of the elite
without having to pay like one.

But even if the programs Pitt Arts
offers don’t fit into your schedule, you
can still take advantage of other free or
cheap alternatives.

Here in Oakland, right by that park,
there is the Carnegie complex, home to

the Carnegie Library, Carnegie

Museum of Art and Carnegie Museum-

of Natural History. The two museums
are considered among the best in the
country — and are, more importantly,
free to Pitt students during fall and
spring semesters.

That’s right — free. You pay no
admission charge to get into these
museums. And they’re not ones that you
can get through in just one afternoon
either - so you can take your time,
explore ‘the content and come back to
explore more another day.

But the Carnegie museums are not
the only ones in the city. The North
Shore is home to the Andy Warhol
Museum, also free to Pitt students and
easily accessible from the 500 bus.
There also are the Mattress Factory and
several other cultural amenities.

And in . Schenley Park we have
Phipps Conservatory, a greenhouse
open year-round "that houses exotic
plants. Its exhibits change throughout
the year, depending on the season. It’s
also free to Pitt students and just a short
walk from campus.

So now the time has come to
explore Pittsburgh. The University says
that the city isour campus — take the
establishment up on that. Don’t conﬁne
yourself to our little corner of
Pittsburgh — see the whole enchilada
while you’re here.

Limbaugh wannabe interrogates college kid

I try to stay away from politics, but
somehow it keeps pulling me back in.

Wednesday morning, I
received a message from some-
one at WPXI News that they
wanted to interview me in
response to a Perspectives col-
umn I wrote two weeks earlier
in The Pitt News. In this col-
umn, “In time of crisis, where
have all the skeptics gone?”
(Sept. 20), I conderrmed the
“war on terrorism” and
expressed distaste for the U.S.
government. I called the phone

back “I’m with the Channel 11 News, and
we would like to know if

you’re available for an inter-
view in about 10 minutes.”
- Confused and not knowing
what to expect, I agreed. ,
less than ﬁve minutes
later, I found myself speaking
with a news personality on
live television. I had no idea
to whom I was speaking. But
it was immediately clear that

machine.

He read a portion of my article, then

questioned me on how I could ﬁnd the U.S.
government “oppressive” — ‘a claim I had
made in my eolurrm. He also questioned
my assertion that the United States engages
in cultural imperialism.

I simply am not very politically mind-
ed. Politics makes me angry and upset
sometimes, and I write about it. But I have
a great deal of trouble holding my own in
political debates — I simply do not have the
memory for it.

When he asked about our govem—
ment’s oppression toward other countries, I
could only think about what was currently
on my mind: That the United States ftmded,

checking to make sure we agreed with his
politics. Now we plan to do the same for
Afghan rebels.

This is not exactly an example of ’

oppression. It works better as an example of
our country’s pride and ignorance.

He countered this by saying ﬂiat our
ﬁiends and enemies change all the time.
After all, didn’t I _remember that
Revolutionary War we fought, against one
of our current strongest allies, England?

What I should have said was that those °
two things are completely different. We
should never give people weapons while
ignoring their politics, especially people
who live in extremely politically turbulent
areas. Enemies and allies change, of course.
But does that mean that the U.S. goVem-
ment should train and arm the Michigan
Militia to help us ﬁght killer bears, or might
that be a tad risky to us in the long run?

V The thus-far urmamed television per-
sonality went on to say that US. business
does not engage in cultural imperialism
and, even more outrageously, stated that the
people of other countries simply adore
America and the way we invade their cul-
ture.

Oh please. I suppose next he’s going to
claim that guns don’t kill people.

After the interview ended, I scrambled
to ﬁnd the television station he was on to
see to whom I had been talking and what he
was saying about me now.

I learned later that day that it was one
Fred Honsberger, a local Rush Limbaugh
wannabe. When I found the show on the
television, he was talking to a woman who

I had called in. Both were more or less talk-

ing about what an idiotl was. Honestly, I

4 probably did sound like an idiot.

But I was completely unprepared.

intelligent than a ﬁfth grader ifI called one
up and started asking him questions in my
own forum without affording him the
opportunity to gather his thoughts too. '
Unfortlmately, people like this really
pose a threat to our world’s weH being.

On Honsberger’s Web site,

www.kdkaradio.corn/talk.html, he writes, »

“The peace-nicks have surfaced, telling us
how horrible a war against innocent people
will be.”

It’s ﬁightening that anyone could feel
such contempt for a person because he of
she wants peace and thinks war would
suck “Peace-nick” just doesn’t feel like an
insult to me.

I would call a person like this, who is
so eager to ﬁght wars against whomever we

head.” And that, to me, sounds like an
insult. ’ _ '

that needs improvement, but it is the one
that receives the most attention. I’m tired
of the whole “David or Rod?” debate. We
need one quarterback, and at this point,
that one should be Rutherford. '

I don’t have ' anything against
Priestley because he has at times put up
solid performances and shown that he
can be competitive. But the problem is
that -he is not consistent, and that is what
this team desperately needs.

Rutherford needs to be given a

The team needs constancy at the position, and
while Harris may be attempting to do this by keeping
Priestley as his starter-, it is not working. Ever since I

he may not turn out to be the_answer that the
Panthers are looking for, but the team will never

he is the future of Pitt football at the quarterback
position — this will be his team next year when

Priestley is gone, so why not break him’ in now? 1
Despite my lack of faith in the two-quarterback
system, I do believe that Pitt will emerge victorious

from this weekend’s meeting with the Fighting Irish.

Notre Dame is winless and 0-3 for the first time ever
in the school’s history. How that is possible still bog-
gles mymind, but the team is having problems get-
ting points on the board and the Pitt defense should
easily contain any attempts at offense. "

The Irish were beaten 24-3 last week by Texas
A&M, a school that’s 4-0 and ranked 22nd in the
ESPN/USA Today Coaches’ Poll but still fails to
impress me. The Aggies barely got by Wyoming a
few weeks ago, pulling out a 28-20 victory, and the
team’s opening win came against McNeese State.
Enough said. But even the score of that game was
just 38-24. ’ ' *

So if Texas ,A&M beat Notre Dame by three

touchdowns, it is certainly not out of the question for .

Pitt to pull. out a victory.
Pitt needs to fix all of the small miscues that

Men’s soccer wins double overtime thriller

‘ KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

No one ever said that wins were easy
to come by.

The Pitt men’s soccer team learned
that the hard way, battling Cleveland
State into double overtime last night
before claiming a 2-1 victory. The
Panthers’ gritty performance earned them
back—to—back wins for the first time this

- season after the team defeated St.

Bonaventure last weekend. .

. Pitt took an early lead on a goal by
Chris Churchill just 4 minutes, 20 sec-
onds into the game. After a shot by Bryan
Hopper hit the post, Churchill banged it
in past Vikings’ goaltender Josip

.Novkovic for the 1-0 lead and his third

goal of the season.

The Panthers continued to drive
toward the net, putting ﬁve other shots on
goal in the ﬁrst half and racking up six
comer kicks.

Cleveland State tied the game at the
70:18 mark when Josh Lidala found a
loose ball in front of the net and put it past
Panther goaltender Justin Gaul. The tally
was Lidala’s first of the year.

The teams remained in a deadlock for
the rest of regulation and through the first
overtime. The Panthers applied pressure
in overtime but N ovkovic made two

saves to send “the game into the second
overtime. ’

Gaul made ‘three saves before the
Panther offense took over. Pitt finally
sealed the victory on an unassisted goal
from Mark Sikora at 124256. Sikora took

a shot from the left comer 30 yards out _ A

and drilled it into the net for the 2-1 win.
Hopper led the Panthers with eight
shots while Churchill and Sikora each

had six. Pitt finished the game with a-
combined 22 shots, 12 of them on goal. H

Sikora’s goal was his second of tl1e[sea-
son ‘ 

eight shots and Joachim Walker added
seven. ’

Gaul and Novkovic each finished
with 10 saves.

Both sides had trouble with disci-
pline as Cleveland State players‘ _1\_:/Jlatt
Milcetich and Vetus Syracus_e§7“'both
received yellow cards and Pitt’s Jeff
Krause was issued a red‘ card. The
Vikings committed a total of 21 fouls
compared to 14 by the Panthers.
~ . The win improves Pitt’s record to 3-
6 while Cleveland State falls to 2-8. The
Panthers will return to action Saturday
afternoon when they travel to Syracuse
for a Big East matchup.

Panthers will choke
against Notre Dame

Last week I went 3-2, bringing
my season record to 10-8. But after
failing an _investment management
test miserably yesterday, I think I
migh_t have to.up the ante this‘week

.so I can pay for summer school.

Syracuse helped me out last
week, covering for the third consec-
utive week, while Nebraska and
Vanderbilt also covered.

The two losses are credited to
Miami and Boston College. Miami
was on its way to covering when

Rod Rutherford scored at the end of "

the fourth quarter and Boston
College beat Army by 21, missing
the push by four points. ,

There are a lot of intriguing
games on the slate, but before I get
to some of the more interesting
games, I must first take a look at
the Pitt game.

‘Michigan (-10) at Penn State
Penn State should continue its
losing ways this week when it hosts
No. 15 Michigan. -
In their two home games against
Miami and Wisconsin, the Nittany

, Lions have been smoked 51-13 and

have yet to reach the redzone at,
Beaver Stadium. .
Michigan looked pretty impres-
sive last week, when it pummeled
then-No. 23 Illinois. Quarterback
John Navarre is second in the Big
Ten in passing yards and running
back B.J. Askew leads the confer-
ence in‘ scoring. Askew has scored
six touchdowns this season, "with
five of them coming on the ground.
Michigan wideout Marquise
Walker is averaging 16 yards per
catch, and he has crossed the goal

line on four occa-

sions. .

As opposed to Pitt, Notre Dame
actually got some plays off last
week, but unfortunately for the
Irish, they could only rack up 191

total yards. The offense has been so .

bad that head coach Bob Davie is
going to take over as the offensive
coordinator this week.

Carlyle Holiday gets the start at
quarterback for the Irish, replacing
the ineffective Matt LoVecchio.

Notre Dame’s three losses have
all come to respectable teams. The
team lost to Michigan State at home
and was embarrassed on the road
twice, at Nebraska and last week-
end at Texas A&M. .

Under normal circumstances, I
would like Pitt to cover because the
offense can" only get better and
because this is an important game.
But. if Pitt can’t settle down and
execute in its own stadium, than I
can’t imagine that the team will
have more success in front ~ of
80,000 angry fans, in one of the
Meccas of college football.

Davie has a lot of pressure on
his shoulders, and I think the Irish
have to come out and make a state-
ment because their coach’s job is on
the line.

East Carolina at North Carolma

, I think I’m ready to jump on the
North Carolina bandwagon. The
team lost its first three games, but
the beginning of the schedule was
simply brutal as they faced
Oklahoma, Maryland and Texas.
The team’s fourth game looked
like it would be another loss but

UNC came out and obliterated‘

Florida State, 41-14. Many thought
that there would surely be a let-

week to host East Carolina, who is

Iowa will top Purdue

in Big Ten

Darian Durant are doing a fine job

- sharing time.

I like the Tar Heels.
North Carolina 31, East Carolina
20 9

Iowa at Purdue (-3)
As senile as JoePa is, he was
correct last week in saying that

~ Iowa cannot be called a “sweeper”

anymore because this team is legit.

With senior Kyle McCann lead-
ing the way at quarterback and fel-
low senior running back Ladell
Betts taking McCann’s handoffs,
Iowa has an experienced offense
that will not be easily shaken.

In Iowa’s win ‘over Penn State
last week, McCann looked sharp,
completing 16 of 25 passes for 225
yards and a touchdown. Betts
rushed for 95 yards.

Iowa has outscored its competi-
tion 119-37 this season.

Purdue comes into the game
ranked No. 23. Filling Drew Brees’
shoes at quarterback is freshman
Brandon Hance, who ranks fifth in
the Big Ten in passing yards. Hance
has done a competent job thus far
but he has not faced much competi-
tion.

A below average Minnesota
team took Purdue to double over-

‘ time, and the team almost dropped

its opener to a mediocre Cincinnati
team. This is Hance’s first big game _
and I’m not sure if'he’s ready for a
fierce Big Ten matchup.

Iowa 21, Purdue 20

matchup

Toledo (-12) at Ohio

Toledo is ranked in the top 25
for the second consecutive year,
bringing more respect to the Mid-
American Conference.

The team has one of the top
rushers in the nation in Chester
Taylor. Taylor currently ranks first
in the nation in scoring with 21
points per game, and third in the
nation in yards, with 145 per game.

Toledo has manhandled all of its

opponents up to date, putting up _

,167 points to the opposition’s 62.
Ohio has lost all of its games this
season as Akron, West Virginia and
Iowa State have all feasted upon the
woeful team.

Toledo 35, Ohio 14,

Extra, Extra

There are a couple of other real-
ly interesting lines out there. I like
Tennessee only giving 12 points to
Georgia with the game in
Knoxville. The .Vols have been
crushing everyone and covering
too. Syracuse is ‘giving 25 points
on the road to Rutgers. Rutgers
might be one of the most miserable
teams that I’ve ever seen and

Syracuse is really starting to play‘

well.

After easily beating Pitt, Miami
is giving 52 points to Troy State.
Have you ever heard of Troy State?
I haven’t. Anytime you see a 52-
point line, chances are you should
jump on it because it’s that large for
a reason. I also really like UAB to
cover the 2 1/2 points that it’s giv-
ing to Central Florida.

Panthersexplode on offense

two. On Friday, starting goalie
Chris Garmen stopped eight of nine

_ shots and Pitt took the 9-1 victory.

Brad Blum and rookie Kent Horner
had two goals each. Dave Konn led
the team with a four-point game by
notching three ‘goals and one assist.
Matt Hawryluk, Matt Ronan, Dan
Lenza and Derrick Baur helped out
with one goal each. -
Saturday night saw another Pitt
victory, this time by the score 5-2.
Backup goalies Pat Rall and Jon
McGrath combined to stop 26 of 28
shots with McGrath getting the Vic- ‘

tory. Richter got the Pitt scoring
started in the first period on ‘an
assist from Rall. In the second peri-
od Hawryluk and Lenza each
recorded their own goals, with
Blum and Sean "Kelly finishing off
the scoring in "the third period as
Pitt cruised" to the victory.

,“We looked good,”’ Richter
said. “Last year they beat us 9-0, so
we got our revenge.” - i

The home schedule starts Oct.
26 at 7:30 p.m. against Penn State.
