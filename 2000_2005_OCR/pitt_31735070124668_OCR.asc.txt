UNIVERSITY TIMES

Helping out

To the University community:

Many members of the Uni-
versity community_are by now
aware of the tragic accident that
happened last summer to Reema
Issa, the 2-year-old daughterof
Mohammed “Mike” Issa who
sells Middle Eastern food from
his truck near Hillman Library.
Reema put her right hand into a
working rnincer while her parents
were distracted and the hand was
sliced off. —

As an article in The Pitt News
of Oct. 1 3 noted, Mohammed had
been unable to get his HMO to
pay for a prosthetic hand, on
‘grounds that the prosthetic would
be simply “cosmetic.” The cost
of a non—ﬂexing prosthetic hand
would be about $7,000 and the

cost of one that would provide-

an elementary grip would be
roughly $11,000. Obviously,
the prosthetic would need to be
replaced as Reema grows.

We are glad to report that
there is now a good prospect of
Reema getting the less sophisti-
cated prosthetic. But it is unclear
whether a replacement will be

covered and we would like to be.

able to offer the family support
as Reema grows. We have there-
fore set up a special account, with
the assistance and supervision
of PNC Bank, that will provide

for Reema’s health, education,

— maintenance and welfare in the

coming years, and we are also in
the process of establishing a trust
fund for this purpose. .

If members of the University
community would like to assist
Reema, they may send donations
to the Reema Issa Fund, account

you can give.

To the editor:

Allow me to make one cor-
rection in Peter Hart’s interest-
ing article ‘.‘In search of secrets
of the Cathedral” (University
Times, vol. 36, no. 2 [Sept. 11,
2003]) about the unknown and
unseen corners of the Cathedral
of Learning.

VVhile there is a locked room
on the 3rd ﬂoor above the Yellin
wrought-iron gate, it does not
contain a pipe organ. The Com-
mons Room never had a pipe
organ. However, it did have a
Hammond Concert Model
electronic, organ installed many
years before I was appointed to
the-Pitt faculty (1962). It was
used to provide music for various
social and ceremonial occasions
— especially Lantern Night.

During the late ’60s, I came

into the Commons Room and -

turned on the organ in prepa-

ration for the ceremonial entry.

march. A few minutes later the
Hammond had overheated and
began to smoke. We discon-
nected the organ and I ran to

- the grand piano that used to be

in the Commons Room. In the
dark and out of sight, I began to
play the march.

A ‘benefactor immediately
came forth and gave the Com-
mons Room a second Hammond
electronic organ. Installed near
the Yellin gates, where the origi-
nal instrument had sat, it became
too convenient as a podiumsfor

studentdemonstrators during the ;
late 60s. To protect the organ, it «

was reinstalled in a locked room
on the 3rd floor overlooking the
Commons Room. It also was safe
from the University organist!

Determining
what is
inappropriate
To the editor:

I was immensely impressed
with the University’s laudable
efforts in accommodating those
with special needs,as described
in the University Times (Dec.
4, 2003). I am proud to be a
member of a community with

such comprehensive and, sup-_
portive solicitude for people
A with special medical and physi-

cal problems. Pitt’s heart is in the
right place. A

Button the other hand I.

take issue with the declaration

by‘Pitt’s Office. of Disability

Resources and Services that »

certain terms are considered
inappropriate, from which-I am

led to infer that the useof these _

terms should be avoided. At the
same time, however, I applaud the

-Ofﬁce of Disability Resources

and Services for its efforts to

 

come to grips with this situation

and for its praiseworthy sensitiv— ‘

ity to the feelings of those who
must navigate through life with
an array of obstacles intruding
upon their ability to lead fulﬁll-
ing and contributing lives, lives
that, but for the grace. of God,
are not trod by the likes of thee
and me.

Among the terms’ that are
designated “inappropriate” I
must say that I dissent vigor-

. ously from labeling these terms

inappropriate: afﬂicted, defec-
tive, deformed, helpless, invalid,
lame, maimed, paralytic, paraple-
gic, retard, stricken and victim.
VVhile any particular word might
be offensiveto some people, the
fact remains, nevertheless, that

‘that particular word does have

an acknowledged and explicit
denotation, aside from its con-
notation, a denotation that,
therefore, confers legitimacy
upon the use of that word. Thus,
to take an example or two from my
foregoing demurral with-words
that Pitt’s ofﬁce designates as
inappropriate, 1 say that if you’re
helpless, you’re helpless; if you’re
an invalid, then you’re an invalid;

ifyou were, say, stricken bya crip-

pling disease, then, unforttmately,
you were stricken. To say that_a

person is helpless, is an invalid ‘

or hasbeen stricken does not, in

and of itself, make that person an ‘

untouchable second—class citizen
who should be deprived of his or

A her civil rights and civil liberties;

As a matter of fact, I would go
so far as to say that the upfront
unapologetic use of words such

as afflicted, defective, deformed; ‘

helpless, invalid, lame, maimed,
paralytic, paraplegic, retard,
stricken and VlCt1I’I1 serves the
constructive and ameliorat-ive

goal of doing something about .

—. legislatively or" via employer
policies;-.— the special needs of
people with medical or physi-
cal problems. Calling a person

afﬂicted, acknowledging that he -‘

is deformedor that she is lame
sends a message to a caring’soci—

’ ety that the rest of us should step
up to the plate and help our less. _

fortunate brethren.

So, by way of summary, I wish
to emphasize these two -points’.
First, that its good intentions not-

withstanding, Pitt’s venerable and »
hard—working Office of Disability ‘

Resources and Services should be
cautioned against, as Isee ‘it, a
politically correct revisionism, its
inappropriate andpresumptuous
role as a language censor — a la
George Orwell’s “1984”and its
infamous newspeak; and, next, I

am convinced that straight-talk-"

ing is an instrument for helping
to address the problems that
people with special needs must

endure.

IVIATTERS

Following the Post—Gazette report from our,,Senate com-

munity relations committee’s December meeting on pedestrian’

safety in Oakland, I’v'e become even more insecure about walk-
- ing in Oakland. . .asking myself, like Laurence Olivier’s character
in “Marathon Man,” “Is it safe?” The answer, quite simply, is
“NO.” V
My e-mail in-box has seen asteady stream of pleas about any
number of potential pedestrian death stretches around campus: the
. lengthy gantlet across Fifth at‘Belleﬁeld; the jaywalk orgy across
Bigelow between the Cathedral and the VVilliam Pitt Union; the
obstacle course of a makeshift parking lot on hold that’s Clemente
Drive before evening classes. ' A
Anyone with even a modest tenure in Oakland can recount
personal near hits (not nearmissesl), friends or acquaintances
of friends who have been part of the pedestrian carnage or the
trauma of bearing witness to this human slaughter. In an hour
span one dayI witnessed: a young woman in hermaroon Chevy
speed up to run — not the yellow light, "mind; you — the red
light at Forbes by Hillman...a light that is a good 20 feet past
the pedestrian crosswalk that had a “walk” signal-, two people in a
red Taurus gingerly roll right through the crosswalk at this same
intersection in hopes of turning right on red against the posted
“No turn on red” sign, and countless left turns from Forbes up
Bigelow that were made right through the oncoming traﬁic lane.
Motorists aren’t the only culprits. One doesn’t haveto look
very far to see ﬂagrant jaywalking, even jaywalking with a decisive
death wish. It’s as if somewhere along the road to college, we
have unlearned the kindergarten lesson to “look both ways before

crossing the street.” And'let’s not even get into bicycles! Suffice.

it to say that, according to campus police, of the 10 pedestrian
accidents with -injuries around the campus in 2003, three were
bicycle related. And, yes, bicycles are street (not sidewalk) vehicles

, and subject to all traffic codes, the same as cars.

Some estimates note that nearly 70,000 folks travel Oakland’s

I '1 streets each daywith about 2 5 ,000-3 0,000 of these having a desti-

nation_ in Oakland. That’s a lot of trafﬁc coming in and even more

trying to pass quickly through ——. perhaps. too quickly. As I have-

come to learn, the state has jurisdiction over Forbes Avenue and
the City of ‘Pittsburgh over Fifth Avenue. Those two ‘streets are
designed with timed lights to make sure heavy traffic ﬂows through
smoothly and quickly, often at cross purposes to those in pedestrian"
_mode. As-the third busiest commercial district in Pennsylvania,
Oakland is truly an “accident waiting to happen.” 
That pedestrian safety issues ‘were raised at both University

. Senate and‘ Faculty Assembly-y tmeetingso late... this term.
prising, especially after the pedestrian fatality at the Biomedical’

Science Tower 3 construction site in October. This safety matter

was referred to the Senate community relations committee in 6 ‘

hopes of bringing together Pitt and community voices to identify
critical problem ‘areas,’ discuss. issues related to safety in these
areas, and recommend solutions. Already the Staff Asso‘ciation’s
safety committee has documented dangerous and poorly marked
intersections around campus and forwarded that information ‘to
the city— so‘ far without response — and local community groups
also have been pressing.for improvements in Oakland. ’

I At the‘December community relations committee meeting,

~ community representatives from the Oakland Transportation and

Management Association and Oakland»Planning and Develop-
ment Corp. came together with Pitt police, faculty, administra-
tion, staff and student representatives fora lively and pointed
discussion of numerous campus and community hot spots. It
was obvious from the long list of problem areas and situations
that this matter will require further study, priority setting and a
collective will to get action. . I - . _ 2
Issues were raised: How to reconcile the Fifth and Forbes
local vs. ‘through traffic? How to get the state and city together?
VVho’s going to pay for safety improvements? How can you get a
distressed city to ante up?'If the University takes the initiative does
that confer liability? VVho can andshould police motor vehicle
-‘violations? Can and should pedestrian laws be enforced? VVhat
can be done short term and what needs to be part of longer-term

"community improvement and public transit and other traffic plan- I

ning initiatives?’ Say, hasn’t the Allegheny Conference adopted
a campaign to make Oakland a‘ Showplace again, and shouldn’t

' /traffic and safety be another priority on that agenda?
That so many diverse interests are coming together to identify

common concerns and pool their efforts is a good start. Aworking

group has been established with the daunting task of examining . I

andmaking recommendations over the next several months. That
group will" report to the ‘community relations committee, which

I will take the recommendations to the University Senate and,

as needed, to city, stateand other authorities. Representatives
from the Mayor’s office, Pittsburgh police and other relevant

government and University offices have asked to be involved. _

The working group also will seek to pull in other expertise. If you
would like to add your voice to this mix, e—mails can be forwarded‘
‘to working group co-chairs Wes Rohrer, wmrun+@pitt.edu, and

ampus and community
cgroups are joining forces
to help alleviate safety con-
cerns, particularly for pedestri-
ans, on the Pittsburgh campus.
The chief of Pitt’s police
department, Tim Delaney,
addressed pedestrian safety and
related matters at the December

meetings of both the Staff Asso— '-

ciation Council (SAC) and the
Senate’s community relations
committee. vThe latter meeting
also included invitedguests
from two Oakland community
groups.
See Senate Matters column,
page 2. I . —
In the wake of last October’s
pedestrian fatality near the con-
struction site of Pitt’s Biomedical
Science Tower 3 (Oct. 23 Uni-
versity Times), campus safety
concerns. were raised at Faculty
Assembly and University Senate
‘meetings. The community rela-
tions committee, chaired by

' Tracy S_oska, agreed to tackle the

V issue by bringing community and
University leaders together for
discussion.

“There was a general con-
sensus [at the Dec. 8 community

relations committee .meeting] _

that while motorists ‘are prime

targets for action, pedestrians
"also are ripe foreducation and

‘ To the editor:

The strong reaction by Pitt’s
vice chancellor for research con-
duct and compliance, following
the University Senate’s plenary

session on shared governance 1

and reported in the University

0 Times on Nov. 20, 2003, came '

as something of a surprise. In a

- University Times interview, Vice

Chancellor Randyjuhl stated that
Ihad “bushwhacked the chancel-
lor and the provost at a public
meeting,” referring” to the plenary
~ session in which I was an invited
faculty panelist. As a matter of

fact, my remarks described a

number of problematic situa- V

tions for which an improvement
in shared governance might
have beneﬁted our University.
‘Such -unfounded criticism by a

' ' prominent member of the Pitt
V 1 administration can only inhibit-'

openidialogue with the faculty

1 on any subject. ' 5.
‘In a Iighter vein, my dic-_ -

tionary deﬁnes bushwhack as

(1)_ “to attack suddenly. from a 0

place of concealment”; and (2)
“to ambush.” Vice Chancellor

' Juhl surely must realize that the’

podium at a plenary session of
the Senate is hardly a place of
concealment, especially ‘before
an audience offaculty members
and administrators on a sunny
afternoon. Furthermore, this
ambush just might have been the
first ever to have occurred in the
student union. . I
Needless to say I have long
been an advocate -of faculty
participation in governance at

Pitt. As far backjas 1998, I had

called for a meetin

 

in constant need of education
was also ‘a common theme of
the discussions. The occasional
tragic incidents galvanize our
concerns.’’ 0
According to Pitt’s Chief Del-
aney, ‘-‘There were 10 pedestrian
vehicle—related accidents in 2003 ,
three of which involved bicy--
clists” within the conﬁnes of the
Pittsburgh campus. ”
Delaney reported on -recent
Pitt police initiatives at both the

' SAC and community relations

committee meetings.
These include: a
° 'Upgrading the campus-
wide ‘emergency phone system.
“There are about 430 emergency
phones [campus-wide],” Delaney
said. Following an alert from a
Pitt staff member of loose wires
and missing phones in the
O’Hara parking garage, Del-
aney ordered an overhaul of the
entire system. Pitt has ordered
new software that allows ofﬁcials
to check the phones remotely; it
is expected to be installed in the
near future, he said.
' ’ Installing pedestrian
right—of-way signs in ‘select
crosswalks, such as on Bigelow

University Senate, following
faculty complaints that they
were increasingly being left out
of Pitt’s decision—making process.-

The UniversityTimes headlined

the story, “Shared governance is —

topic for administrators, Senate
leaders.”-I reﬂected after the

is meeting that it seemed-to me to ”

be a‘ good beginning. ;

Five years later, I had ‘hoped
that ongoing dialogue on the sub-
ject of shared governance could
have occurred at the recent'ple-
nary session, the topic of which
was selected by the current presi-
dentof the University Senate, Dr. ,
Nick Bircher. Rather, I believe

‘that faculty efforts to‘ improve

shared governance at Pitt have
suffered a significant setback
or, based on the nature of what
I had said and on the response”

S by Vice Chancellor Juhl, I think

that sharedgovernance and open
dialogue with the administration
might even be dead-in-‘ the short
term. 0

First, the relationship between
the topic of the ‘plenary ses-
sion (shared governance) and

' Professor MacLeod’s recitation

of sensationalized allegations
against fellow faculty members

‘engaged in laboratory research .-

taken" from an activist web site

-is not clear to me. Second, in

the spirit of shared governance,
the courtesy should have been
extended to his colleaguesthat
this seemingly unrelated topic
would be raised and allow them
the opportunity to prepare for
the discussion. - ,

0 Our faculty and staff who
engage in laboratory research
are a very. responsible and

"honorable group of individuals

whose values run parallel to the
accountabilities we have to the
public in the conduct of this
very important research. The
committee responsible for deci-
sion—making about our ethical
and regulatory compliance in the
conduct of laboratory research‘
involving animal subjects is a
peer-review group composed”
primarily of faculty volunteers.

_ Through the concerted efforts of

_ faculty and staff researchers and

volunteer committee‘ members,
our programs ’ meet or exceed
the standards of our accrediting
body and remain in good stand-
ing with governmental regulatory
agencies. Like many components '

i’ of our society however, the level

of detail necessary to document
the operational,eleme_nts of our
shared values in the day-to-day
‘conduct of research is increas-
ingly challenging and occasion-

S allywe‘ are less than perfect. An

“We’re such a transient society,
and every year we get a new crop
of kids. We need to address the
safety factors in walking and
common courtesy when you’re
walking,” Delaney said._

-° Working with Pitt’s Park-
ing, Transportation and Services
on a plan to alleviate traffic and
pedestrian congestion caused by
Pitt’s shuttles, particularly on
Bigelow.

“It was my idea originally to
put the buses as close to the stu-

dents without-having them walk '

through too many intersections, ”
Delaney said. “If the bus pulls up,
picks the students up right away
and moves out of there, it’s not
such a problem. VVhat we can’t
have is them [queued] there on
Bigelow.”

Alternatives under consider-
ation are all flawed,'he said. The
driveway in front of the V\/illiam
Pitt Union is too narrow for easy
access by full-sized buses and too

‘ congested with students pouring
in and out of the WPU; likewise
less than ideal is moving the
shuttle stopacross the street to
adjoin the Pittsburgh Athletic

Association, which would force -

students to‘ cross_ heavily traf-
ﬁcked Fifth Avenue. ,
“Right now, I’ve asked drivers
to stage in front of Frick FineArts
near the water fountain, because
that does the least amount of
damage to the trafﬁc in Oakland,

_ but drivers ‘on break who want to

getsomething to eat have to run a
couple blocks,” Delaney said.
A ° Enforcing. double-park-

attendance at the plenary session
in placing Professor MacLeod’s
comments into context.

If "there is "concern on the’

part of Professor MacLeod, or
others, about the quality of our

' research programs or our adher-

ence to the attendant regulatory
responsibilities, I welcome the
opportunity to discuss them.
Alternatively, there are several
resources available to those
wishing to learn more about both
the value of laboratory research
involving animal subjects and
the corresponding ethical and

F regulatory requirements:

medical Research. The front

Blenk, executive director of Oak-

ing laws. “We do have ofﬁcers
driving around the block and
moving people who double-
park. We ticket if the vehicle is
left unoccupied,” Delaney said.
“But it’s like swishing water out
of a puddle. At rush hour, I’ve
got a group of people who want
to leave Oakland and a group
of people who want to get into
Oakland.” Oakland has a dearth
of convenient drop-off/pick-

_ up spots for passengers, and

almost no loading docks in the
commercial district, he pointed
out, both of which contribute to
double-parking., ’

Other problems peculiar
to Oakland include the large
volume of daily through trafﬁc
and the synchronized traffic light
patterns on Fifth Avenue that
favor vehicles at the expense of
pedestrian safety.

Also, no single govern-
ment entity has authority for

V Oakland’s streets, Delaney said.

Fifth Avenue, for example, is a
city street while Forbes Avenue
is a state road.

The police chief said that

enforcing jaywalking laws was

not a particularly viable option .

and ‘would require many -more
times the police force than cur-
rently is available. “The City of
Pittsburgh had a total PR mess
by citing individuals for jaywalk-
ing in Downtown,” he pointed
out. Rather, he advocated more
educational efforts aimed at
pedestrian safety.

Also addressing the»commu—
nity relations committee Dec. 8
meeting were SAC safety and
security committee chair James
Lyle, Mavis Rainey, executive
director of the Oakland Trans

 

land Planning and Development
Corp. (OPDC).

Lyle distributed a portfolio
of some 30 photographs docu-
menting poorly marked pedes-
trian crossings, unsafe surfac/es,
hazardous intersections andlpoor
handicap—access at crossings on
and near campus.

Rainey reported on OTMA’s
focus on pedestrian and bike
safety, as well as their involve-
mentinstudying Oaklandtrafﬁc,
parking and mass transit. OTMA
has petitioned PennDOT suc-
cessfully to eliminate synchro-
nized trafﬁc lights along Forbes
Avenue’s commercial district in
favor of alternating pedestrian-
phase only signals. OTMA also

has launched a bike safety cam- .

paign that includes a web—based

Q

  

resource guide (www.otma- .

pgh.org), she said.

Blenk said OPDC hopes to
address signage, walk-ability and
other physical improvements that
could enhance safety. Oakland as
a destination versus Oakland as
a major thoroughfare has made

I pedestrian safety a critical issue,

Blenk said.

Following the meeting, the
committee organized a working
group on trafﬁc and pedestrian
safety, co-chaired by Chief
Delaney and community rela-

tions committee member Wes"

Roher.
The next community, rela-

tions committee meeting, slated '

for Jan. 14 at 12:30 p.m., 2117

e CL, will. be devoted to.Oakland

safety ‘issues, committee chair

chancellor receiving a 3 percent
raise is very much in line with the

However, for many staff, a 1-3
percent annual raise will not offset
the increase in health care or the

UNIVEPRSITY TIMES

Major construction, renovation projects slated  

itt is revving its con- _

struction engines again;

. State-funded projects on

the Pittsburgh campus totaling
$42.5 million are on the docket
for 2004, according to Ana

Guzman, associate vice chancel— .

lor for Facilities Management.
Set for renovations and

upgrades are the Cathedral of

Learning, Chevron Science-

Center and Trees Hall. A major
addition will increase labora-
tory and related space in the
Clapp/Langley/ Crawford halls
complex.

Money to fund the projects
has been released by the state’s
Department of General Services ,
which administers the design and

construction of all state-funded
projects regardless of the percent-

age of the total cost that comes

from the commonwealth.

“In the next few months, the '

University community here in
Oakland will see considerable
construc-tion activity started, as
these projects go into construc-
tion,” Guzman said. “But Facili-
tiesManagementisworkingwith

the Registrar’s ofﬁce, the Arts and '

Sciences dean’s ofﬁce and other
relevant Universityunits, includ-
ing faculty in the affected areas
like chemistry and biological
sciences, to minimize the dis-
ruptions on campus.” ._
Following the ﬁrrning-up of
construction schedules, Facilities

Management plans to inform
individuals directly affected by
the projects in advance of any
disruption. “We do not plan
large moves of people as part
of the implementation of these
projects,” Guzman said. “How-
ever, it may be required that
some individuals share offices
or some laboratoryfunctions for
a few days while work is being
performed in their areas.” , .

- Facilities Management also is

establishing a web site to convey 7

information on progress of the
construction projects, she added.
The site (www.um‘c.pitt.edu/

__ renovate) will be on-line in about

two weeks. .

renovations projects are:

0 Phase I-A expan-
sion of Clapp/La_ngley/
Crawford (CLC) halls com-
plex; cost: $25.5 million.

This project will add 50,000

gross square feet of space to

Langley Hall for biologyresearch
laboratories and ancillary stor-
age spaces. The infrastructure
work will include installation
of new plumbing, HVAC, ﬁre
protection and laboratory sys-
tems on the 2nd and 4th ﬂoors
of "Langley Hall, in preparation

for future laboratory renovations
in those areas. ‘ '

“Once we complete the
renovation to the systems in the
CLC complex, the building’s
ventilation systems will have
considerable more capacity, so
as to meet present and future
research needs and also they will
be more economical to operate
and maintain,” Guzman said.

Construction bids for the

project areexpected to go out
in February; contracts will be
awarded in March, and con-
struction is" tentatively sched-
uled to begin in mid—April,
with a completion target date of
October 2005 .

Included in the renovations

iare the"installati'on of forced

air ventilation, air‘ conditioning

and related equipment and tem— '

perature controls, and upgrades
of electrical systems. The project

also involves replacing the ﬁre _
V sprinkler protection and obso-

lete air conditioning equipment

‘that feeds the 7th, _8th and 9th

ﬂoors. ' .
In preparation for the proj-
ect, temporary partitions were
installed last month on the 2nd
and 3rd ﬂoors to isolate the con-

»struction areas.- ‘ .
‘Also, an ongoing asbestos

removal effort is part of the
project, clearing some of the
Cathedral corridors’ plaster ceil-
ings to accommodate new piping
and ductvvork installation. Con-
tained areas forasbestos removal
will be cleared prior to work done
in those areas, Guzman said. '

' ' This renovation project is the

largest ever done in theCathe- .

dral of Learning at one time,

‘she said. “Originally, we were
looking at dividing the ﬂoors in

quarters and having four phases
of construction instead of two,

but this would have lengthened

the overall project schedule and I
the disruption to the building‘

and ‘it would have been more
expensive.” ,

Guzman praised the Reg-
istrar’s office’, which controls
the] scheduling of classes in
the Cathedral, for re-locating
classrooms to other buildings,
allowing Facilities Management

to compress the construction ’

schedule into two phases. (

0 “Having 49 classrooms in the
Cathedral with proper tempera-
ture controls and ventilation in

the winter and air conditioning
in the summer will be a real
improvement over the present
conditions,” Guzman said.

The majority of the CL
demolition workwill take place
during the 11.p.m.i to 7 a.m. shift
to minimize noise and disrup-
tions, she said. . .

Questions regarding the proj -
ect should be addressed to David
Bowers, "Facilities Management
project coordinator, at 4-9500.

The 15th annual long-term staff recognition reception honored Pitt staff members for milestone years of service. ChanceI_lor Mark
Nordenberg (center) called the event "one of the high points of each academic year, honoring -significant contributions over time
that make the University more than a place on the map, [making it] a shared vision." ' -» ' a

At the Dec. 11 reception,'10 staff members were honored for 40 years of service, 28 for 30 years and 68 for 20 years. An’ additional
179 staffers completed 10 years of service and 304 staff members reached the five-year milestone in 2003. ‘ ‘

The University of Pittsburgh
Press publication “Curative
Powers: Medicine and Empire in
Stalin’s Central Asia” by Paula A.
Michaels has won the Heldt Prize

‘ for the bestbookin Slavic, East

European and Eurasian studies
by a woman.

The prize is awarded annually
by the Association of Women in
Slavic Studies, an affiliate of the
American Association for the
Advancement of Slavic Studies.

In “'Curative Powers,”
Michaels reconstructs how the
Soviet government used medi-

cineand public health policy to .

transform the society, politics and

culture in the outlying region of

Press book wins prize  

Kazakhstan.- Michaels, who is
assistant professor of history at
the University of Iowa, exam-
ines how the Soviets used tech-
nologies, medical personnel and
public health initiatives intended
to win the people’s gratitude and
move the region toward civiliza-
tion and political enlightenment
—— as defined by the Soviets.
According to the Heldt cita-
tion, “Paula Michaels combines
detailed historical research with
ethnographic methods and the
judicious use of colonial and
postcolonial theory to argue
that medical initiatives played
an important role in spreading
Soviet power.” ' I

2 Pitt centers join forces with
World Affairs Council of Pgh.

Pitt’s Center for West Euro-
pean Studies (CVVES) and*Euro—

. pean Union Center (EUC) have

teamed upwith theWorldAffairs
Council of Pittsburgh in‘ an
expanded educational outreach
initiative focusing on European
affairs and U.S.—European rela-
tions.

In addition to its annual sup-
port of Pitt’s EUC, the European
Commission has pledged $3 7 ,41 7
to fund ‘outreach programs?
designed to educate area teachers
and students about the European
Union (EU), a changing Europe
and transatlantic relations.

“One of the reasons EUC was
originally funded was to better
inform the University commu-
nity and the region about the
increasingimportance andimpact
of the EU in world affairs,” said
Thomas Allen, a CWES pro-

gram administrator and graduate

adviser. “The new grant furthers '

the fulﬁllment of that charge and
simultaneously allows us to build
on an already strong relationship

, with the_World,Affairs Council

of Pittsburgh.”
Several activities are planned
for spring, including aroundtable

dinner program for teachers and
a fund-raising event to support
a visit to Brussels that will allow
area teachersand civic-leaders to
le-am first-hand about the Euro-
pean Commission. In addition,
graduate students affiliated with
CWES will give presentations
on EU and Europe to area high
school students. '

“This outreach is our bread-
and-butter,” said Schuyler
F oerster, president of the World
Affairs Council‘ of Pittsburgh.
“More than two—thirds of the
WorldAffairs Council’s program-
ming is dedicated to secondary
schools, reaching more than
12,000 students and teachers

each year. We are delighted to.

partner with CVVES and—EUC
in securing this generous grant
from the European Commission
to strengthenthis important out-
reach.” ” i

The World AffairsCouncil of

Pittsburgh is a nonproﬁt, non-

partisan organization designed to
promote greater understanding
of important international issues
throughout the community and

‘particularly within the region’s

secondary schools. I

UPB president pledges to new
technology fundat Bradford  

Livingston Alexander,
president of Pitt—Bradford, and
his wife, Evelyn, have‘ pledged
$5,000 to esltablish a new fund
that will enhance the university’s
technological capabilities.

“I worry a lot about the impact
technology is having on our col-
leges and universities and about

our ability to adapt,” Alexander‘

said. “We must begin to position
ourselves to effectively adapt to
these" changes. The funds gen-
erated through the Zippo Tech-
nology Challenge will enable us
to prepare for a vastly different
future, shaped in part by major
technological changes.”

The Alexanders’ gift will
be matched by the Zippo/Case
Technology Challenge, which

-was created with a $1 million

pledge from. Zippo Manufac-
turing Co., WR. Case & Sons
Cutlery Co. and the Philo and
Sarah Blaisdell Foundation.
The matching challenge is
part of Pitt-Bra’dford’s Com-

plete the Campus Campaign,-

10

which aims to raise $3 million to

enhance and maintain technology '

on campus. ._
“The Zippo technology
challenge/match will go a long

. way in assuring continued suc-

cess and assimilation of tech-
nology onto our campus,” said
Don Lewicki, assistant profes-
sor of business management

. and director of the management I

information systems -program at
UPB. * ' ,

Control Chief Corp., a wire-
less solutions company in Brad-
ford, also has pledged $5,000 to
the Pitt—Bradford technology
effort. '

. created from the funds will be

equipped with technological
enhancements, including a com-
puter, sound system, VCR/DVD
player, media cabinet, projection

units, screens and cont_rol—switch— '

ing matrix software.

of Philosophy, recipient of a
Mellon Distinguished Achieve-

.x.:~..

-ment Award in “recognition of n

his exemplary contributions to’

_ humanistic scholarship.”

The award is one of the larg-

of Library and lnformationsciences (SIS), was honored Dec. 17

$1.5 million each.

The foundation called Bran-
dom “one of the ‘most creative
philosophers of language and
mind working today.” Making
It Explicit” [Harvard University

Press, 1994], his ﬁrst book, is.

regarded as a leading contribu-
tion to understanding the nature
of norms, rules and commitments
in thought and action — one of
the most pressing problems in
philosophy and in the social sci-
ences — and has been compared
to landmark works from the pre-
vious generation of philosophers.
A forthcoming major work on
Hegel is much anticipated, not
least for its promise to offer a

comprehensive analytic read— “

ing of a markedly nonana_ly1:ic
philosopher.

" “Professor Brando'm’s teach-
ing and supervision of graduate
students manifest the same qual-
ity and rigor of his own scholarly
work,” the foundation statement
added.

The awards are designed to
underscore the decisive contri-
butions the humanities make to
the'nati_on’s intellectual life. The

- funds associated with the awards

are administered through‘ the
recipients’. institutions.

“One thing that is special
about this particular award is
the way it acknowledges the
symbiotic relationship between
thinkers and the institutions that
nurture them,” said Brandom, ”I
have spent my entire career in
the -philosophy department at
the University of Pittsburgh

, —— a department that has consis-

tently been recognized as one of
the top ﬁve in thenation. During
this period, Ihave beneﬁtedlfroﬁi
and appreciated its unﬂagging
support, as the department has’
beneﬁted from and appreciated
the unﬂagging support of the

A University. I want over the next

few years to ﬁnd creative ways

to expend’ the funds the Mellon H

Foundation has so generously
provided, both in pursuing and
developing my own philosophi-
‘cal ideas and in_ strengthening

those institutions, to whose»

research mission these efforts
contribute‘ and which make the

wofk possible.”

- Brandom, who has been a Pitt
faculty member since 1976, is a

fellow in Pitt’s Center’ for Phi-

losophy of Science and a fellow
of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences. He has served as
chair of the University’s philoso-

1 ‘ phy department.

Mellon award candidates are

invited by the foundation to’

provide statements describing the

' merits of the candidates they are

proposing. Additional references
are sought for the most promising
candidates. .These are reviewed
by the foundation’s senior advis-

SARS corona
vaccine

Research by scientists at Pitt’s
School ofMedicine and Graduate
School of Public Health (GSPH)
in collaboration with colleagues
at the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention in Atlanta has
shown that an adenoviral-based
vaccine can induce SARS—coro-
navirus (SARS—CoV)—specific
T-cell and virus-neutralizing
antibody responses.

The ‘study,’ which represents
the ﬁrst published work on'the
development of a SARS vaccine
and comes only a few months
after the SARS coronavirus was
identiﬁed and its genome was
sequenced, was reported in a
fast track research letter in the
Dec. 6 issue of The Lancet.

“It is our hope that this
research will lead to a’ protective
vaccine against SARS,” said proj-
ect leader Andrea Gambotto of
the departments of surgery and
medicine, Division of Infectious
Diseases and the Pitt medical
school’s Molecular Medicine
Institute 

In the study, researchers
immunized six rhesus macaques
intramusculhrly with a combina-
tion of three SARS-,CoVvectors.
Two. additional macaques were
immunized with the same amount
of empty adenoviral vector and
served as controls. After 28 days,
the animals received a second vac-
cination.

‘Six weeks after vaccination,
T-cells and antibodies against
SARS were detected in all six of
the immunized animals, but notin
either of the control animals. The
intensity of the response varied‘
among animals but generally was

largest after the booster vaccina-
tion, according to the Pittsburgh
researchers. Serum samples from

the vaccinated animals, but not ’

from the controls, showed strong
neutralizing capacity against
SARS—CoV. .
“From a scientiﬁc perspec-
tive, several points are impor-
tant,” Gambotto said-. “We
obtained’ the recombinant vac-
cine by" engineering a common

cold virus to express the SARS’

coronavirus antigens. This is a
successful strategy that we are
exploring for other infectious
diseases such as HIV. After injec-
tion, the vaccine acts as a Trojan
horse, ﬁrst by infecting cells in

the body, and then stimulating‘

an immune reaction to thedeliv-
ered SARS antigens, ultimately
conferring protection against
the disease. Also, the induced
immune reaction appears to be
broad: Both antibodyand cell-
mediated immune responses,
equally important for protec-
tion from viral infections, were
detected in the test animals.”
Gambotto said researchers
now will test the vaccine in fer-

rets, which have been shown by
a group of Dutch researchers to.

develop SARS symptoms after
SARS—coronavirus infection,
unlike the monkeys in the cur-
rent vaccine study. _ J
“This testing is important

to fully assess the’ ability of .our _

recombinant vaccine to protect
from subsequent exposure to
the SARS coronavirus. We also
are soon planning human clini-
cal trials in the near future here
at the University of Pittsburgh
as part of the MMI initiative,”
Gambotto said. The M1 is
the nucleus for gene and pro-
tein therapy research at Pitt and

provides the infrastructure and

resources necessary to translate
gene therapy protocols rapidly
from bench to bedside.

SARS emerged as a threaten-
ing and deadly infectious disease
last year in China. Wentao Gao,

. research instructor in the Depart-
ment of Surgery and co-author of .

the study, said his participation in
this research was especially mean-
ingful because SARS claimed
several livesin his hometown of
Changchun, Jilin. “I am proud
of what I have contributed in the
development of a SARS vaccine,
given that the adenoviral-based
vaccine is economical and suit-
able for a large population. I hope
we will soon be able to translate
this vaccine into clinical trials to
test its toxicity and efﬁcacy,” he
said. . ' - ' I ‘J

tially blinding eye disease that

affects thousands of premature’

infants can prevent severe
vision loss, a large clinical study
has found’.

Results of the National Eye
Institute—supported study, which
took place at 2 6 centers across the
United States, including Magee-
Womens Hospital, were reported
in the iDecember issue of the

Archives of Ophthalmology.

“This study deﬁnes new rec— X

ommendations for treatment and
expands the number of babies we
are able to help with retinopathy
of prematurity,”said Kenneth P.
Cheng, principal . investigator
for the trial at Magee—Womens
Hospital and a clinical instructor

in 'Pitt’s ophthalmology depart-.

ment. _

“The findings are very
important because they will lead
tofewer babies with vision loss
caused by this disorder.” ~ .

Retinopathy of prematurity,
or ROP, is a condition that
takes place in premature infants
of low birth weight ‘(lessthan
2.75 pounds) when the normal

development of the retina is inter— I

rupted, resulting in abnormal
blood vessels and scar tissue. In
severe cases, this scar tissue may
pull the retina, -the part of the eye
that functions much like the ﬁlm

' in a camera, out of position to

produce retinal detachment.
ROP is uiipredictable and will
regress spontaneously, sparing
vision in some. infants, while
progressing in others to damage
sight. This unpredictability can
complicate treatment decisions‘
since premature infants make
particularly fragile patients.
Previously, ophthalmologists
deferred therapy :until it was
clearly indicated by deteriorat-
ing vision. _ p"
‘ According to researchers, the
Early Treatment for 'Retinopa—

thy of Prematurity (ETROP)

study clearly demonstrates that
premature infants who are at
the highest risk for developing
blindness from ROP will retain

better vision when therapy is

administered in the earlier stages
of the disease.Just as importantly,
the study establishes the necessity
for improved assessments to more
accurately identify patients at the
highest risk for severe vision loss

‘ from ROP.

' Each year, ROP affects 

» estimated 14,000—1'6,000 prema-

ture, low birth—weight babies in
the United States and thousands
more worldwide,'makingitalead—
ing cause ofvision loss in children.

Of these, about 1,500 infants will .

develop severe ROP requiring
treatment‘. Despite available

' therapy, however, some 400-600

infants still become legally blind

— each year from ROP.

Traditionally, treatment
was indicated once the risk of
retinal detachment approached
50 percent. ETROP study par-
ticipants were assessed using‘ a
variety of indicators, including’
birth weight,ethnicity, being a
single or multiple-birth baby,

_ gestational age and ophthalmic

exam i ﬁndings to identify those
babies who were felt to be at _high
risk for blindness. _

Once identified, infants

‘were assigned to receive treat-

ment early or at the standard
threshold of 50 percent retinal
detachment. Researchers found

that early treatment signiﬁcantly .

reduced the likelihood of poor

. vision from 19.5 to 14.5 percent

at about 1 year of age. Early treat-
ment also reduced the likelihood
of structure damage to the eye by

a considerable amount —— from

15.6 to 9.1 percent.

Current treatments for ROP.

involve laser therapy, which
uses heat from light energy, or
cryotherapy, which uses freezing
temperatures, to slow the growth
of abnormal blood vessels. A side
effect of such treatment involves
partial loss of peripheral vision,
but the treatment is still consid-

eredvaluable because it preserves . J
the most important part of sight ‘

4- the sharp, central vision
needed to see faces, read or per-
form detailed tasks that require
hand—eye coordination.

The ETROP study will con-
tinue to follow enrolled patients
through age 6 to ensure that the
beneﬁts of early treatment persist
into childhood. At the Magee site,
70 babies were -enrolled in the
study over a period of two years.

Of those, 12 were assessed at high

risk for ROP.
Also participating in the
Magee study were neonatolo-

._ gist and co-principal investiga-

tor Beverly Bro'z”anski, associate

professor of pediatrics and obstet- '

rics, gynecology and reproduc-
tive sciences at Pitt’s School of
Medicine and an assistant inves-

Buliga, an assistant professor of
mathematics at the Bradford
campus, and Gregory Con-
stantine, a mathematics profes-
sor at the Pittsburgh campus, has

_ been accepted for publication in
‘ an upcoming issue of. the Inter- ,

nationalJournal of Mathematics

.The result presented in the I

paper, “Determinantal Generat-
ing Functions of'Colored Span-
ning Forests,” is a generalization
of a well—known theorem from
graph theory that uses colors,
Buliga said. .

Each edge of a graph is col- '

ored, and the paths that connect
pointson the graph, called span-
ning trees,- are colored in a speci-
ﬁed way and listed by computing
a determinant. An algorithm for
generating colored spanning
trees and colored spanning

forests, a set of different paths

that don’t have to be connected
between them, also is presented

in the paper.

As a possible application, of the ;

result, Buliga said, the vertexes of
the graph can be thought of as the
cities of a country, and the edges
of the graph could be different
types of merchandise that can be
sent from one city to another. The
colors.of the edges canrepresent
the type of merchandise.

I A spanning tree of a certain
color type could be represented

A by a path that will connect all

cities without creating a cycle

. such that the. merchandise sent
‘from a certain city has a speci-

ﬁed ‘type.

,I\Iitric oxide
therapy proves
effective for
newborns

An inhaled treatment for criti-
cally ill newborns is less invasive,
more effective and costs less than
the treatment that traditionally
has been used to treat apotentially
fatal condition called hypoxic
respiratory failure (HRF),
according to a study published
Dec. 8 in the journal Pediatrics.

The study reveals a rarity in
today’s world of rising medical
costs: a breakthrough treatment

that beneﬁts patients and is lese.

expensive than the standard
treatment. -

“It’s almost unprecedented to
hear of an advanced medication
that actually saves money com-
pared with an older treatment,”
said Derek C. Angus, the study’s
lead author and director of the
Clinical Research, Investigation
and Systems Modeling of Acute

Illness (CRISMA) laboratory at

Pitt. »

HRF develops in newborns
whose lungs cannot ‘deliver
enough oxygen to their bodies,
causing them to appear bluish
and endangering their lives.

‘ ,The condition often appears

on the ﬁrst day after birth, and
affects about 30,000 ‘full-term
and near-term infants each year.

i There is no way to predict which

infants will develop HRF, so there

. is no known way to prevent the

condition.

In the past, the only effective a

treatment for newborns with
HRF who did not respond "to
aftiﬁiiiail ventilation and supple-
mental oxygen was an invasive
surgical ‘procedure known
as extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO), which

.involves cutting a newborn’s

. jugular vein and putting the
~ baby on a ‘heart-lung machine

to oxygenate the blood. Besides
being invasive, the procedure
has_the potential to cause severe
complications. '

Nitric oxide, by contrast, is -
administered as an inhaled gas,_ —

and has few potential complica-
tions. But while hospital stays

V involving ECMO are rei1n—

bursed by private and govern-
ment insurance plans, experts
say that reimbursement for
inhaled. nitric oxide tradition-
ally has been inadequate. This

I is based in large part on the fact

that it is a newer treatment than
ECMO, and thus reimbursement
policies have not “caught up” to
the fact that the therapy is now
more- widely used. a

“Many therapies and life-
equipment. readily
accepted by society are quite
costly,” said Maria Hardin, vice

' president of patient services for

the National Organization for

Rare Disorders (N ORD). “Per-'

haps now that we have hard data
on the cost savings this treatment
provides, insurers will do a better
job of covering it.” .

" The ' new study shows that
inhaled nitric oxide actually
saves a signiﬁcant amount of
money when compared with the
older and more invasive ECMO
procedure: .

° For every‘ 100 newborns
with HRF, treatment with inhaled

nitric “oxide, resulted in a cost

savings of more than $440,000.
This savings occurred among
newborns who did not‘ need to
be transferred to another hospital

‘ for ECMO treatment.

0 Much of the cost savings
stems from the avoidance of
ECMO, a costly’ surgical pro-
cedure.

' Treating newborns with
inhaledlnitric oxide at local hospi-
tals (rather than hi gher-level hos-
pitals that also provide ECMO)
was most cost-effective, because
when the treatment prevented the
need for ECMO, it also prevented

the cost of transferring the baby V

to the ECMO center.

~ Using the data from two
randomized controlled trials and
other real-life experiences with
ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide,
researchers at the University of

Pittsburgh ’s CRISMAlaboratory

developed a cost-effectiveness‘

model that estimated treatment
outcomes and costs associated

with treatment and recovery.

The researchers looked at two
scenarios: a “base case” where
babies were transferred to
advanced-care hospitals where
ECMO was available, /and a
“reference _case,” where .,nitric
oxide therapy was administered
at local hospitals. Both scenarios
suggested that nitric oxide ther-
apy was cheaper and more effec-
tive than ECMO. The base case
study showed a savings of $1,880
per case, while the reference case
showed an even higher savings
 $4,400 per case. .

In December 1999, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved nitric oxide
fdfiiiihalatiori “ti(iﬁarke’t'é.d under
the trade name INOmax) used

‘in conjunction with ventilatory

support and other appropri-
ate agents, for the treatment
of term and near-term (less
than 34 weeks) neonates with
HRF associated with clinical or
echocardiographic evidence of
pulmonary hypertension (high
blood pressure in the lungs). The
drug works by relaxing smooth-
muscle cells in blood-vessel walls
in the lungs, allowing the lungs

to oxygenate the blood properly -

and provide it to the rest of the
body. This studywas supported in
part by a grant from INO Thera-
peutics, Inc., which manufactures
INOmax».

Nature shown
to increase
deadly effects
of pesticide
Professor Rick Relyea has
found‘ that low concentrations
of a globally common_ pesticide
can be up to 46 times more lethal
to amphibians when tested under
more natural conditions. Relyea’s
research was published in the
December issue of Ecological

4 Applications.

“VVhile pesticide tests have
been traditionally conducted
under highly artiﬁcial condi-
tions, researchers ultimately
want to know the impact of
pesticides‘ under natural condi-
tions,” said Relyea, assistant
professor in the Department of
Biological Scienpes. “By adding
one common environmental
stressor — predation — we ﬁnd
that a globally common pesticide
can be much more lethal than we
once thought.”

The pesticide tested, carbaryl, '

is one of the ‘most common insec-

ticides in the world and is sold".
commercially as Sevin. It is used 3

to control insect pests on more
than 100 species of crops and in
3 1 million gardens in the United

States _...Car.baryl, like many other V .

insecticides, acts as a toxin on the

- I'l€I'VO11S SySt€1'I1.

_ “Amphibians are experienc-
ing global declines, and in some
areas of the world these declines
appear to be linked to pesticides,”

said“Relyea. “However, pesticide "

concentrations in these areas are
often low and considered nonle-
thal, as deterrninedby traditional

_testing methods.”

Pesticide tests‘ usually exam-

ine the impact on animals in the.
absence of factors including the

stress caused by predators that
livein an amphibian’s natural

environment. To address this

issue, Relyea exposed six spe-

-cies of amphibianitadpoles to

predatory stress and varying
concentrations of carbaryl.

The red—spotted newt, a natural '

predator of tadpoles, was present
in the environment but separated
in a plastic container. The smell
of the newt in the water caused
the tadpoles to react to’ the newt‘

as a threat, even though it could
not actually harm them.
At low doses of carbaryl, there

was little mortality with either -

carbaryl or predatory stress, but
high mortality when the two
factors were combined. In all six
amphibian species tested, higher
concentrations of carbaryl caused
highefmortality.

Physicians .
influence‘ who
gets ﬂu shot

Patients who see physicians

" in clinic settings that promote

inﬂuenza vaccinations through
organized programs, provide
education about the vaccine
and provide easy access to the
vaccine are more likely to get
vaccinated, according to a Pitt
study published in’ the January
edition of the American Journal
of Preventive Medicine.

A decrease’ in, the number
ofpeople receiving the vac-
cine in past ﬂu seasons has, in
part, contributed to the current
shortage of ﬂu vaccines. In years

when vaccine rates are low, vac-

cine production is reduced for
the next year in response to the
lower demand, according to the

Centers for Disease Control and '

Prevention. '

“By studying what causes
‘people to get vaccinated, or not
vaccinated, against the‘ ﬂu, we can
develop ways to betterpromote

' vaccination,” said Richard Kent

Zimmerman, associate professor
of family medicine and clinical
epidemiology. “Just through
vaccinations we can, most
importantly, save thousands of
lives and tens of thousands of
hospitalizations.” ’ .

~ excess hospitalizations. In years

when there is an inﬂuenza epi-
demic, numbers can climb to
over 40,000 deaths and 300,000
hospitalizations. —- I
“The ﬂu vaccine is a simple
and inexpensive way to prevent
the ﬂu,” said Zimmerman. “We,
as doctors," need to educate our
patients about the ﬂu and about

_ the importance of the vaccine for

each patient.” ‘

This study, conducted before
this year’s inﬂuenza outbreak,
sought to identify factors that
inﬂuenced receipt of ﬂu vac-
cinations. .

The study found that patients
who had favorable opinions
towards preventive health
-measures, including favorable
opinions on the usefulness of
vaccines, were the most likely

to get vaccinated against the ﬂu. 5
Additionally, physicians’ offices.

and clinics that offered express
vaccination clinics had higher

» vaccination rates.

Veterans Affairs institutions
had the highest immunization
rates at 91 percent. Research-
ers credited‘ their success to a
comprehensive campaign that
created a culture that promotes
prevention by sharing respon-
sibility among team members
and facilitating immunization
services, such as by holding
express vaccination clinics.

The study was funded by the
Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality. ’

Fruits and vegetables are good
for overall health, and a newly
funded study at the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
(UPCI) may show that certain
vegetables, such as broccoli, also
offer protection against prostate
cancer. . A ,

UPCI researcher Shivendra
Singh, professor of pharmacol-
ogy and urology at the School
of Medicine, has received a $1.7
million grant from the National
Cancer Institute to study -pros-
tate cancer prevention by phyto-

- chemicals found in broccoli called

isothiocyanates (ITCS).

Singh, also co—leader of
UPCI’s cancer biochemopreven-
tion program, said, “ Our goal
with this study is to better under-

. stand thefunction and relation-
. ship of substances in broccoli that

appear to be linked to inhibiting
prostate cancer growth.”

ITCs are substances in
vegetables that are generated
when vegetables are either cut

. . or chewed. Previous research
~ has demonstrated that ITCs are

highly effective in affording pro-
tection against cancer in animal

models induced by carcinogens.‘

Epidemiological research also has

shown that increased. consump- .

tion of vegetables that contain

in :ITCs signiﬁcantly reduces the
risk for prostate cancer. ,

"that so_me naturally occur-

Secure-CITI
of Pittsburgh

Oil spills. Landslides. Tor-
nadoes. Plane crashes. Pile-ups.
Floods. These are just a few of

‘ the emergencies and disasters

that could occur — and have
occurred — in Pittsburgh. VVhen
the call comes in, emergency
management teams of Alle gheny
County respond.

_ Pitt researchers are devel-
oping a system that will allow
emergency managers in Allegh-
eny County to make timely and
better, planned responses.

The system, a Secure Criti-
cal Information Technology
Infrastructure ‘(S-CITI) for
Emergency Management, will
integrate incoming real-time
data from» cameras and sensors
and signal when data deviates
from normal activity.

Funded bya $2 .8 million grant
from the National Science Foun-
dation (NSF), S-CITI will be the
ﬁrst of its kind to simultaneously
integrate data from multiple

"sources. No city has a compre-
hensive system where data from
utilities, the National Weather

,SCI'VlCC and tI‘3fﬁC SCI1SO1'S are

«integrated in real time.’
Existing.electr'icity, gas, water

and temperature_sensors as well ‘i

as traffic cameras will be utilized
by S,-‘CITI, and new sensors will
be added. :

Daniel ' Mossé, associate
professor in <Pitt’s Department of
Computer Science and principal
investigator for S-CITI, and his
team are working with the chief
of Allegheny County’s Depart-

ment of Emergency Services,.

Robert Full. Talks are underway
to evaluate the ‘needs of the

county’s_ emergency managers,
fidentify security concerns and

: discuss "how S-CITI can best

accommodate the county.
“The computer scientists
will identify the most appropri-

ate ways to represent the infor- ,

mation, integrate it and merge
it Without revealing ‘anyone’s

’ secrets, but still be able to develop

coordinated action for multiple
organizations in emergency

situations,” said'Louise Com- ,

fort", co—principal investigator
and professor in Pitt’s Graduate
School for Public and Interna-
tional Affairs.

Securityiis quintessentially .
. vative multidisciplinary research

important, said Comfort. Allegh-

eny County has 130 municipali- ,

ties, each with its own a secure
information. In order for a central
system to be implemented, each
jurisdiction must consent volun-
tarily to release its information.
Mosse envisions a system that

uses the information without
releasing it, except in an emer-
gency when the data is needed
to coordinate a response.
“Computers can marshal all
kinds of complex and diverse
information, which can be pre-
sented to the decision-makers in a
clear, logical and timely way. This
will assist the emergency manag-
ers enormously,” said Comfort.
“They need to be able to review

the information in a way that’s 1

easily comprehensible, then make
a decision.”

A critical piece of the system
will be a learning module, which
will analyze post—emergency data
and use the results for future
pre-emergency planning. For
example, explained Mossé, if
one day the system detects much
higher than normal usage of gas

and water and lower than normal -

usage of electricity, it will alert
emergency managers.

“Maybe there was an earth-
quake or a landslide and some
electricity poles were downed

"and some water pipes and gas
lines were broken,” said Mossé.

If the change in sensor activ-
ity is not an emergency situation,

the emergency managers will be ,

able to program the system to
ignore certain signals at certain
times. The system will learn to

— alert the managers only in actual

emergency situations.
The system could be useful
in detecting such potential secu-

rity threats as harmful materials .1

entering the cityon trucks coming
through the tunnels. It also could
alert emergency managers when
information is not coming in that

. should be coming in, such as when

power lines go down. .
. .. Mossé’s.team will spend the
first few years of the S-CITI

- project building a prototype of
' the system within the Depart-

ment of Computer Science and
then Within part of the University.
Potentially, the system will have
directilinks with the Pit police.

, When the system is sufficient, it

will bedeployed in the city, and
possibly Allegheny County.
