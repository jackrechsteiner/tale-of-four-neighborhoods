Hotel Schenley: making an American city

ERIC LIDJ I

Senior Staff Writer

Across the world, cities have come to represent

much more than simply an urban area where People _     ' _  5

live, work and play. There is a noticeable aura sur-
rounding Athens, London, and New York. They‘
defy the restrictions of a literal definition of “city”
and achieve much more.

As the 19th century came to a close and the role
of industry increased, Pittsburgh stood at a take—off
point. The steel mills grew more and more success-
ful, and citizens became wealthier and wealthier. A
few visionaries

decided that
Pittsburgh, was
ready _ to

become the all-
American city.

The 10- .
story building
that sits on the corner of Forbes Avenue, Fifth
Avenue and,Bigelow Boulevard was once a catalyst
in that time period. The building that now plays host
to sandals and radio stations once had a guest book
worth hundreds of thousands in signatures. But as
Pittsburgh, along with its constituents, grew and
matured, thingsinevitably changed.

This is the story of the Hotel Schenley, a build-
ing with.a remarkable past; A’ building that ulti-
mately became the William Pitt Union.

In its heyday, Hotel Schenley — what is now the William Pitt Union — played host to presidents and baseball greats.

  Career services works

SYDNEY BERGMAN
The Pitt News

Free food, free clothes and a possible $40,000 a
year ‘— the three offers drew students to the William
Pitt Union’s second ﬂoor for placement and career
services’ Senior Day yesterday.

In addition to the miniature Cheesecakes and
Diet Pepsi offered yesterday, this office provides
students.with resume reviews and career counseling.

Seniors and graduate students can take advan-
tage of the services - offered by career services,
aimed at guiding them toward advanced degrees and
careers.

“We’re giving seniors an idea of where to start,”
said Jami Guddenburr, a practicum student from

‘ '~ ‘ Slippery Rock who works in the office.

‘“ Because on-campus job recruitment begins

Sept. 18, some seniors now find themselves in a
struggle to prepare their resumes and ready for
interviews. Firms in all fields —— from the DKW

Law Group to Ketchem Advertising — come to Pitt
in search of potential employees. Although some .

recruiting, such as -nursing and biotechnology, is

"major-specific, employers consider students from

all disciplines. . v

For instance, consulting companies hire those
with skills in problem solving and logic. Starting
salaries at these corporations are upward of $32,000
a year. . -

Teaching is another intensely recruited field.
Last year, Pitt attracted eight representatives from
Hawaii, who offered new teachers pay of $30,000
per year and the option of choosing the island on
which they wanted to live.

Placement and career services uses Senior Day

to prepare seniors for entrance into the world

to inform studentsabout its advising efforts, such as
Pawsfest and Creative Careers. Pawsfest introduces
students to Panther Tools for Recruiting and Career
Services, an online personalized pathway that
allows. Pitt students and alumni, access to job and
internship information. 0

‘The service boasts approximately 600 job and
recruitment advertisements; almost of 300 of those
postings are for part-time employment. Though
these notices tend to focus on engineering and tech-
nological fields, ads for communications and media
also make a showing. 0

The other program, Creative Careers, brings in

professionals from liberal and fine arts fields to talk
to students. As Barbara Juliussen‘, career services’
associate director, said, “It’s fabulous to hear the

Senior Jim Miller and Jason McAdams, a graduate-student at Carnegie Mellon
University, fight it out in a jousting match at Campus Fest yesterday.

Jousting and surfing J
offer midday break  

COURTNEY LYNN
TherPitt News

Surfing is back in style on.Pitt’s
campus.

So are jousting, free food and
phrases made popular by the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

“Cowabunga dude,” affirmed
junior Robin Gorjin as he rode the
giant Reese Sticks Surf Sensation

. on the William Pitt Union lawn yes-

terday. Gorjin, a native of Exton,
Pa., laughed as he called the ride,
“The best experience of my life.”

“I’ve surfed in Waikiki and Gold
Coast Australia and this topped it
off,” he said." .

Campus‘ Fest has invaded the
Union-lawn for the 10th year in a
row. ‘ '

The event, which includes infor-
mational booths, athletic challenges
and product giveaways for students‘,
will continue through today.

One of the more popular booths
is the Shot Clock Challenge, where
students test their free-throw skills
against the clock to win T-shirts,
basketballs and magnets.

Justih Davis, a transfer student
from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania who began school
here this fall, worked the Shot"

Clock Challenge. According to”

Davis, the booth saw students non-
stop all day. Davis ga,ve away 1,000
jugs of milk and at least 200 T-shirts
yesterday.

At the jousting booth, freshmanj .
Andre Szumylo took on his best 
friend, Chris Zieger.‘ The fight 
looked like life-or-death but turned 

out to be just -a friendlyjbattle
between classes. ‘

. “During the joust Chris hit mezin A }
the‘ head really hard, but I had-;zt_ 1;

really good time,” Szumylo, said.

Pitt’s assistant director of stu§ 0. 
dent activities, Tom Misuraca,Dsaidg" If
he was pleased that theievcnt is free 3 

for students. .

_ “Students seem to enjoy them; 
selves,” he said. “We’Ve S6611 a 1011"

THE PITT NEWS

From cars to kittens, kiosks have it all

J ACLYN LOGUE
The Pitt News 5

When Russ Schneider, a medita-
tion student since 1990, decided to
pass along his knowledge of the
“Meditative Way,” he ﬁgured the best
way to spread the word would be to
advertise on local college campuses.

Schneider placed his ﬂier atop
dozens of brightly colored signs that
decorate Pitt’s kiosks, which are locat-
ed around campus for student groups
to post ads and announcements.

The kiosks boast a variety of
ﬂiers, from the mundane to the bizarre.
Need furniture, a car or a ride home for
the holidays? Perhaps becoming
involved in a game of Assassin, a
friendly game of premeditated murder
sponsored by the Pitt Gaming Club, is
more appealing.

The kiosks also offer a wealth of
information on ways for impoverished
college students to make a few bucks.

Programs such as the America Reads
Challenge offer work-study positions
to students who qualify. Several online
casinos post ﬂiers promising $10
worth of free chips to those who join
their club. Students who qualify can
also participate in a variety of medical
studies that offer ﬁnancial compensa-
tion. ‘

Jonathan Fellion, the clinical
research coordinator for Pitt’s School
of Pharmacy, used the kiosks to search
for participants for a study at the
University’s research center in UPMC
Montefiore.

.“I’ve hung about 40 ﬂiers through-
out Oakland and the kiosks,” Fellion
said, adding that the ﬂiers had resulted
in approximately 15 calls in one week‘.

Frugal students may want to visit
the kiosks to peruse a multitude of
advertisements listing used furniture,
textbooks, cars, bikes and other assort-
ed goods for sale. One ﬂier advertises
a Pitt vs. South Florida football ticket

' Oakland Business

for $5.

But if $5 proves too ﬁnancially
draining, other options exist. Another
ﬂier offers a free one—bedroom mobile
home, listed in good condition, which
can be moved or kept on the lot where
it now sits.

As recently as two years ago, these

- ﬂiers could be found not only on cam-

pus kiosks, but also on telephone poles
throughout the Oakland area. Then the
Improvement
District began removing the ﬂiers
because they were hung in violation of
a citywide ordinance.

“The kiosks have helped our ini-
tiative in cleaning up Oakland,” said
Lori Kumar, the organization’s direc-
tor.

Although students must be willing
to wade through the layers of faded,
weathered ﬂiers, the kiosks house trea-
sures ranging from free homes to fur-
niture to fill them.

Just call for details.

The Steel City
turns into a
1900s hot spot

Schenley, page 1

favorite lounge spot in Oakland was
used for more or less one thing —
cows. A woman whose romantic life
provided a hotly debated controversy
of the day owned about 1,000 acres of
this area. '

This woman, Mary Schenley, left
Pittsburgh for London, where she
learned ‘an interesting land practice
that she would have her American
businessmen implement. She would
rent out parts of her land on long—term
leases. This allowed her to make
money off of .the land while she
resided in London, all the while, keep-
ing the land in her possession.

And it worked for a while, but
soon many of Pittsburgh’s industrial
big boys couldn’t wait. Folks like
Andrew Carnegie, Edward Bigelow
and Henry Heinz decided that
Pittsburgh was ready to grow, and that
Oakland was the premier place to
start. ‘

Plus, they had a fire underneath
them. Local housing developers were
also looking into the land, so Bigelow
hopped a ship to London and got
some face time with Schenley.

In 1889' she gave in and gifted the
city 40 percent_— 400 acres — of her

_ land. In the minds of many, Oakland

was already forming into the entity -it
is today. I _
And soon, things began changing

‘even more.

Pittsburgh prosperity

_' Around 1893, the Carnegie muse-
ums were built. They were filled with
Carnegie’s treasures and replicas
from around the world. Near the
southern border of the newly devel-
oped land, Henry-Phipps built a glass
conservatory to house beautiful plants
year-round. _

In 1898, a 10-story hotel was built
near a ravine. The Schenley Hotel,
named after the tract on which it sits,
is the keystone in an Oakland renais-
sance.

As streets began to fill out the
area and people began migrating here,
the Schenley Hotel became the place
where w.ealthy Americans stayed
when they traveled to Pittsburgh.

Another century brought even
more corporate prosperity. In 1901, a
“Meal of Millionaires” was held to
celebrate the beginning of U.S. Steel.
Pittsburgh became home to the coun—'

Step aside, controversy:
Time to embrace the panther

Want to get rid of those ratty old Pitt
boxers that your mom would never let you
wear outside the house anymore?

Then sacriﬁce them to the panther.

As everyone around campus this week
has undoubtedly noticed, the long—awaited
panther statue outside William Pitt Union
has arrived amid much controversy.

On Friday, when the statue was ofﬁcial-
ly unveiled, protests marked the celebration
and campus debate has raged ever since.

But no matter what your take on the
panther’s ﬁnancing, it is here to stay and we
should embrace it. Like the walls erected on
the Cathedral lawn that bear the University’s
name and seal, the statue helps deepen a
sense of campus identity, the sense that we
are, indeed, on Pitt’s campus. While an
urban school can almost never have a com-
pletely self-contained campus, it doesn’t
have to feel like it’s spread throughout a
neighborhood either.

Several other schools have statues of
their mascots on campus, which increase
school pride — something that Pitt desperate-
ly needs. And it’s unlikely that the Student
Government Board will spend another
$72,000 for another statue anytime soon.

If that’s not reason enough, just think of
all the ftm we could have starting new cam-
pus traditions.

Before games — or just for good luck

— students could kiss the panther. While
that may not be the most sanitary idea, even
shaking the panther’s uplifted paw would
suffice. , ‘

As winter approaches, the naked pan-
ther will undoubtedly feel cold, so perhaps
people oould help it by clothing it in the lat-
est Pitt gear. '

Perhaps fans could make sacriﬁces to
the panther, offering stuﬁed dolls with the
opposing team’s jersey on it in the panther’s
mouth or under its paw before each game. At
the least, this will give us a nice preview —
albeit metaphorical — of what’s about to hap-
pen on the football ﬁeld.

To add some color to the area, the
University could even add painted panther
prints around the statue like the ones that
usedtogracethepathtoPittStadium.

The panther could also become the
focus of this year’s homecoming festivities.
It could be decorated for the celebrations on
Bigelow Boulevard and somehow incorpo-
rated into them.

And ﬁnally, we would like to suggest
that everyone vote for the panther for home-
coming queen (for according to the
University, the panther is female). What bet-
ter way to inaugurate the panther than giving
it a crown and making it a monarch?

Maybe then, it will embrace your dirty
boxers.

The healing power of a package fror§riParisq

In retrospect, I guess it’s a little odd

that I thought nothing of paying the _,

equivalent of $75 for a round-trip ﬂight
between Dublin, Ireland, and Paris.

the reservations desk at Dublin
International, handing me my passport
and ‘boarding card. ’

“No worries,” I thought. I’d been in

— 25 minutes later — that I worried.
Forking over close to $20 each without
having made any headway was worri-
some, even without our typical
American, uptight alter egos.
I worried a lot that first night.
In our zeal to remain

by April, and already I was
envious of the relaxed, lais-
sez-faire Irish lifestyle. It
suited me and I was adapt-
ing well. *

It didn’t bother me to

true to our new, intemation-
al selves, ' we’d agreed to
follow the advice of every
budget European backpack-
er’s icon, Rick Steves.

In scores of years trav-
eling abroad, Steves had
never needed reservations.
If Steves didn’t need them,
why did we? After all, he
was the best-selling inter-

jaunt to “the continent.”

It didn’t even~bother me when the
jet landed two hours laterin the Huddle
of what appeared to be a giant ﬁeld, or
when Ryanair‘ —- the discount, seat-
assignment-free airline — forced us to
pay another $10 for a ride from what
was Paris-Beauvais to the Eiffel Tower,
Arc de Triomphe Paris of our collective
imaginations. ‘

In retrospect, I guess it’s a little odd
that I thought nothing of agreeing to let
a taxi driver persuade Kerry, Brenna
and I to go to the youth hostel on the
Champs-Elysees rather than the one
we’d picked out in the Latin Quarter.

“There is a much nicer hostel on
the Champs-Elysees,” insisted our dri-
ver as we made our way around the

’mind the fact that in subsequent chap-

ters, Steves suggested using old news-_
papers as rain gear during unexpected
storms or eating unﬁnished food from
cafeteria trays to save a few lire, pese-
tas or marks. ,

So after taking the, Metro to the
Latin Quarter, we marched into the first

hostel we saw, conﬁdent in our ability _
to procure three beds. We hardly batted -

an eye when the desk attendant told us

he only had one open bed and that we 4

trudged back to Young & Happy Hostel in the hopes
that two beds more might have magically appeared.

Taking pity on us, the Frenchman behind the counter_ - 

told us he probably had at least one other mattress
somewhere and that we looked tired and hungry, so

we should leave a credit card with himto secure ou .

When I reached into my jacket pocket to with-

draw my abused Visa and felt a lot of nothing, I was _

a wee bit beyond worried.

I imagine it is one thing to realize your wallet’s
been stolen while you are within a few miles —- or
even hours — of home. To ﬁnd yourself without cash,
or means of procuring any, in a nation whose lan-
guage you hardly have a functional knowledge of is
absolutely tenifying.

I’d lost about $300 in French francs and all forms
of identiﬁcation except» for my international student
village card for my apartment in Galway, Ireland. My
Social Security card, my credit card, my bank cards,
business cards, my Take 2 Video card — even my

Subway club card — were gone. Not to mention '

months worth of fortunes from nights out at Fuel &
Fuddle before leaving Pittsburgh.

My “no worries” attitude was gone. The courage
and independence three months of living alone in a
foreign country had produced were replaced with the
sole desire to call home, sobbing.

The crushing blow came when Michel told us
after dinner that he only had two mattresses available
at the hostel. So Kerry and I hunkered down on a sin-
gle mattress, on a grimy tile ﬂoor without sheets,

without blankets and without pillows. We didn’t even
bother putting on pajamas. Thanks, Rick Steves.

Within 48 hours, my parents wired me the rest of
my meager savings account. I would be remiss if I
didn’t remark on the mixture of wonder and gut-
wrenching nervousness produced when your entire
life savings are inside a money belt strapped to your
friend’s stomach. It is also quite a thing to watch said
savings morph into four different kinds of currency
over two weeks.

Amazingly, though, “no worries” prevailed. By
the time we smuggled liter steins from the Munich
Hofbrauhaus, the theft in Paris was close to forgotten.
“No worries” kept me sane on many an overnight
train, while ordering seafood -and having googley
eyes stare at me from in—the-shell-prawns in Rome
and getting drunk on Sangria in Barcelona, Spain.

So when I returned to Galway, penceless, I was
only minorly concerned. And my rapidly growing
credit card debt seemed faraway and more than

i worthwhile.- —

And part of what broke my heart about leaving
Galway — almost as much as the pain of leaving" the

true friends I made, almost as much as missing nights '

out at the pub and mornings in watching rugby —- was

my overwhelming fear that the crazy, fun, carefree '

girl who had had the best time of her life was going to
vanish the instant ‘she returned stateside.

’ So I came back, began working after five months
off, began paying bills after» a five-month reprieve.

And- slowly, even though “no worries” remained- in u

my" vocabulary, it began to fade from my soul. 1
But then one day in July, my parents called.
They’d received an envelope marked “official

American business,” postmarked Paris. Someone '

recovered my wallet — presumably from a trash bin —
and would send it home if I could supply the cost of

shipping. I did so gladly, and although my money

wasn’t recovered, my faith in humanity was (and so
were my fortunes, movie stubs and Social Security
card — and everything else for that matter). And my
original belief that had ﬂagged so recently — that
chaos piled on "chaos really does work out and that
worrying is wasteful and counterproductive —— was
reaffirmed. .

I’m leaving for Chicago tomorrow to interview at
Medill graduate school for journalism. And I’m
scared that I won’t know what decision to make, or
that I’ll make the wrong one for my post-Pitt life. It’s
been keeping me awake at night. Maybe I should just
relax and have faith without worries. . ’

Men’S Soccer heats up on St. Francis

' BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

- Former Pitt soccer goalie Adam 
- . Spitzer couldn’t help but “ooh” and

“ahh” at the physical game last night
between Pitt and St. Francis. Spitzer

Pitt win 3-0.

“I really wish I was back out
there playing,” Spitzer said. “I see
them whenever they are at Seton
Hall or Rutgers. The team is more
skillful now than when I played.”

Skillful was not the word to
describe yesterday’s game. The play
from both teams became intense
early in the first half. About five
minutes in, a defender elbowed Pitt

midfielder
in the face, forcing
Carrizales out of the game, the first
in a series of early penalties.

“I was just bringing the ball
down field when the defender

elbowed me in the face,” Carrizales :0

said. “They were trying to foul to
prove a point.” ~

Carrizales returned to the game
later in the half and his toughness
would prove in the end- The Pitt
offense dominated the rest of the
first half and the Red Flash never
got the ball_anywhere near Panther
goalkeeper Justin Gaul.

“Marco is a solid player and he

business and took time out to see

against the Red Flash.

is getting better,” said Pitt head.
coach _Joe Luxbacher. “He took
some physical abuse and he hung
with it.” p T

' Gaul made a play in the first half
on a miscue by the Panther defense.

The ball rolled into Gaul with St.
Francis’ Aaron Williams crashing
the ‘net. Gaul bent his back to pick
up the ball and at the. same time
ﬂipped Williams over his back and
on the ground. This would prove to

 

— be the final occurrence of the first

half, but not the last for the game. At
the half, neither team had mustered
a goal.

The second half opened with a
bang when the Red Flash took the
kickoff into Pitt territory and quick-
ly put a shot past Gaul. Luckily for
the Panthers, redshirt senior Chris
Churchill was standing on the goal
line and headed the ball out of
harm’s way.

The physical play continued
when Carrizales started talking
Portuguese to a Red Flash player
while he was on the ground, injured.
This confrontational exchange of
words may have been a catalyst for

' the events of the rest of the game.

Then, to make matters worse;
Carrizales scored his second goal of

 the season six‘ minutes after the
. taunting incident. He took a free

kick about 18 yards from the goal
and put it past the St. Francis goal-
keeper into the right corner of the
net. It gave Pitt a 1-0 lead with 27
minutes to play.

“We got a free kick and I saw the.

goalie on the other side of the net, so
I chipped it in” Carrizales said.

After Carrizales’ goal, the game _

got ugly. Just 29 seconds after the
goal, Carrizales was again pushed
from behind, kicked and elbowed by

Cross country team adds youth to

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Another cross country season is just
about to start, and the Pitt team hasbeen
busy attacking the many hills of
Schenley Park. With the best recruit class

"in years and the return of a healthy bunch -

of seasoned veterans, third-year head
coach Waddie Freeman is excited about
the prospect of vast improvement to both
the men’s and women’s squads this year.
“Everybody did what they had to do
over the summer and came back in great
shape,” Freeman said. “We’re deﬁnitely
looking like a better team this year.”
Although she was set back by sever-
al injuries, senior Amanda Schmidt is
leading the women’s team as she did last

\

percent healthy going into Pitt’s ﬁrst
meet — this Saturday’s Duquesne Quad
Meet in Schenley Park.

“She had a very good outdoor track
season,” Freeman said of Schmidt, who
ﬁnished 10th in the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Association 10,000-meter cham-
pionship at the end of the spring. “Her
conﬁdence level is ‘going to carry right
into this season.”

Senior Beth Rocks comes into the
season with high‘ expectations after an
overall excellent junior year. Rocks‘ went
to the national championship in the 800
meter. .

Dawn Hﬂgert had a good rookie
campaign in cross country and in long-
distance track events. Freeman expects
her to make more contributions as a

In addition to the returning stars, the
names of most of the recruits can be
found at the top of the lists of the
Pennsylvania ‘Interscholastic Athletic
Association.

Lauren Shaffer, out of West
Allegheny High, was the state champion
in cross country last year.

“Lauren is also the state record hold-~

er in the indoor 3,000,” Freeman said.
“We’re very excited to have her on the
team.”

Next is the runner-up to Shaffer at

the PIAA cross country meet, Maureen
McCandless, who hails from Nazareth

‘Academy in Philadelphia. McCandless

ran the anchor and mile legs of
Nazareth’s distance medley relay, which
was on display at the Penn Relays as one

“Maureen sho11ld be able to con-
tribute right away,” Freeman said.

-f Erin and Jessica Johnson, twin sis-
ters from York, Pa., were right up there
with Shaffer and McCandless at the
PIAA meet, as was Mary Zettl from
Pittsburgh’s Thomas Jefferson High.

Freeman thinks it’s possible that
these high school top ﬁnishes translate
into Pitt’s move into the upper echelon of
the Big East.

“I’m really excited about the
women’s team,” Freeman said. ‘"I‘hey’re
deﬁnitely looking at a great season.”

Sophomore Mike Diano will replace

the graduated seniors as the leader of the

young men’s team.

being able to name an entire

be the mark of an enthused
fan, but for others the love
goes much deeper.

Baseball is rich in histo-
ry and tradition, and some-
times one of the only ways to
understand it is through read-
ing. Many modern fans of

I One of the best ways to get
acquainted with the Black Sox and the

through Eliot Asinof’s novel “Eight
Men Out.” While there is a ﬁlm ver-
sion, it is limited in its detail and does
not fully explain the incident and the
impact presented by the novel.

Asinof does an excellent job of
retelling the infamous series between
the Chicago White Sox and the
Cincinnati Reds, which resulted in a
Reds championship. It was unusual for
any team to beat the 1919 White Sox

team, let alone take a series from them. ,

in throwing a game will
never play again. Among those players
was Shoeless Joe Jackson, who may
very well have been one of the best
players in the history of the game.
Because of his involvement in the scan-
dal, Shoeless Joe will never have a
chance to be inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame.

But the novel does not just tell of
how this brilliant career was destroyed.
It also describes how Shoeless Joe got
his nickname. Many people are under
the impression that it was derived
because he was too poor to afford shoes
and therefore had to go barefoot.
Actually, he got blisters from wearing a

them off instead of play in pain.

Asinof also brings to light the true
character of White Sox owner Charles
Comiskey, for whom the present—day
Chicago stadium is named. He was a
cheap man who paid his players far less
than they deserved, and sometimes did
not even wash their uniforms after
every game.

This helps to explain why the play-
ers wanted the money promised to them

for ﬁxing the game. They were without ,

a doubt the best team in baseball but
could not even afford a decent living.

Another novel‘ for the die-hard
baseball fan is Cal Ripken Jr.’s autobi-
ography, “The Only .Way I Know,”
which was published in 1998 and went
instantly to the New York Times best-
seller list.

The book deals with Ripken’s life
in baseball from a young age right to
the present day. He talks about team-
mates, discusses life with his father as
coach and manager and recalls playing
side by side with his brother Billy. He
reveals emotions he felt during that
time, and even includes excerpts from
journal entries. , .

' Ripken not only discusses the more
glamorous parts of his career, but the
struggles as well. At numerous times in

. grounding out.

the novel, he talks about batting slumps
and mentions the errors he often com-
mitted in the minors. He tells about his
ﬁrst weeks in the minors, when he

. called home feeling overrnatched and

depressed because he was not hitting,
constantly popping balls up and

The novel also reveals little bits of
information not known by the average
fan. For example, Ripken was a pitcher
throughout his youth. But while he con-
tinued to pitch in high school, he also
took up third base because he wanted to
play every ‘day and would therefore
rather be drafted as a position player.

Ripkenalso goes into detail about a.

nightmarish 1988 season, which began
when his father was ﬁred as manager
only six games into the season. He then
had a terrible year offensively, was
often the talk of trade rumors ‘and was
booed in Baltimore.

Women’s soccer splits

games over weekend 

MATTHEW SCHLIESMAN
" Staff Writer

Head coach Roland Sturk’s plan for
Pitt’s women’s soccer team is a quarter-
ly battle. Sturk divided the schedule
into four sections with different goals
for each quarter. .

The team’s goals for the first four
games are two wins and two shutouts.
The women achieved one of those goals
this weekend when,they beat Central
Michigan 2-1 Friday. Although they
suffered a 1-0 loss to Bucknell Sunday,
Sturk’s team is not defeated yet. “If we
accomplish what we want in each quad-'
rant, then we’re going to have a good
season,” Sturk said. ‘

Pitt 2, Central Michigan 1
The Panthers took a big step toward
their goals, Friday afternoon when

senior Cande Ruiz-Bradbury got a pass E

from senior Andrea Graybill and sent it
sailing into the net less than a minute

and a half into the game. It was a great

start for Pitt, but the action was far from

V over. 4

The Chippewas came storming
back when , midfielder Kjersten
Kuhlman knocked in the rebound off of
Jacqui Lorenzo’s shot to even up the
score with seven minutes left in the
half. I

In the second half, the Panthers
turned up the physical play by out-foul-
ing Central Michigan 9-4. But the
rougher play still couldn’t get Pitt any
more goals and as the final seconds
ticked away, the crowd at Founders
Field prepared itself for a showdown in
overtime.

But with ﬁve seconds remaining on
the clock-, Jacqueline Fix was 15 yards
from the net when she took a pass from
Kimberly Sturk and lofted it over
Chippewa’s goalkeeper, Elizabeth
Quincy, for the win. -« ’ V V

Serious doubts that Pitt can cover spread

I feel pretty good about going 3-2 last
week, since it was the first weekend of
games and it’s hard to make predictions
with nothing to base them on. ’

Unfortimately Adam Taliaferro got to
my heart and my brain last week and
Vlrisconsin put up more of a ﬁght against
Oregon than I had expected.

This week I really like three out of
the four lines that I picked. All of these
games take place on Saturday.

South Florida at Pitt (-21 1/2)

I like this game tl1e least of my four
picks. This line scares me a bit. It doesn’t
look like Antonio Bryant is going to be
playing this weekend, and I’m just not
sure if Pitt can blow out a Division I
school by more than 21 points.

East Tennessee State was absolutely
awful last week. Pitt did not play ﬂawless
football by any means, but it really didn’t
matter. '

In USF’s -20-17 loss to Northern
Illinois last weekend, wideout DeAndrew
Rubin had three catches for 121 yards and
two touchdowns. He is a legitimate deep
threat and a great kickoff and punt retum-
er, and I’d be surprised to see the Pitt sec-
ondary total_ly shut him down.

The Bulls have another scoring threat
in placekicker Santiago Gramatica.
Gramatica, who has two brothers who

kick in the NFL (Martin and Bill), has a 1

strong boot. I’m going with USF to cover.
Pitt 27, South Florida 10

Georgia Tech (-24) at Navy

Believe it or not, this is a big game
for Georgia Tech because it needs to send
a message this weekend to its competi-
tion. T . _

The team plays back-to-back games
against Florida State and Clemson, "fol-
lowing this weekend’s affair at Navy.

The Yellow Jackets have improved
over their last two games. The defense
was extra stingy in the team’s 13-7 win
over Syracuse and continued the trend in
the 35-7 victory against The Citadel.

Georgia Tech crushed Navy last year ‘

40-13, and there is no reason why it can-
not replicate that outcome this season.
Navy took a bad beating from
Temple last week, 45-26, and starting
quarterback Ed Malnowski was benched

aftera nine-for-15, 86-yard performance.

I like Georgia Tech big.
Georgia Tech 44, Navy 7

Alabama (10 1/2) at Vanderbilt

Vanderbilt lost to Middle Tennessee
State, who’s not exactly a powerhouse,
37-28, giving up 203 yards and four
touchdowns to running back .Dwone
Kicks.

Alabama should be looking for any-
one to hit after losing a tough opener at
home to UCLA, 20-17. The Crimson Tide
had a 10-0 lead before UCLA came back.

Alabama has two mobile forces on

offense — running back Ahmaad
Galloway and quarterback Tyler Watts
can both create problems for defenses on
the ground.

By the way, Middle Tennessee State’s
head coach’s name is Woody, and there’s
nothing good about that. If they have any
heart, ‘Bama should Win by more than 10.
Alabama 31, Vanderbilt 17

Cincinnati (-5) at Army _
Cincinnati was one play away ﬁom
leaving Purdue with a win last Saturday.
Faced with a fourth and 15, the
Cincinnati offense broke the huddle with
only 10 players on the field. Running

‘late and was not set when the 
hiked, which erased a pass completion
that would have taken the ball down to
the 6-yard line.

Instead, Cincinnati backed up 5 more
yards and failed to convert on the fourth

and 20 possession.
This is Aimy’s ﬁrst game of the
season, the won just once last sea-
son. Army has a lot of uncertainty
._-  at the quarterback position, and
{-2. the defense is really shallow up
_}§§‘front.
 Last season Army gave up 33.8
oints and more than 400 total
ards per game. If the Bearcats can

down, they should gain redemption from
last week’s debacle. An angry Cincinnati
team should come out and make a state-
ment.

Fix’s game-winner gave Pitt its
third-straight victory in season openers.

Quiney had nine saves for Central
Michigan on 18 shots. Her counterpart,
Gretchen Ross, had four saves on 13

Rachel Brown, who is outwith a medi-

Brown currently has trouble kick-

Bucknell 1, Pitt 0 A

Riding high on Friday’s exciting
win, the Panthers were looking to get
one of the , shutouts they longed for
when they took on Bucknell Sunday
afternoon. Things looked good for Pitt
during the first half as they out-shot the
Bison 10-2.

Solid ball control allowed the
Panthers to set the tempo for the game,
but Sturk’s crew couldn’t keep up the
pace and they started to fade down the
stretch. With six minutes to go in the
second half, Bucknell launched an
attack into Pitt territory and Megan
Farrell lobbed a shot from 15 yards out
over Ross’ outstretched arms to make it
a 1-0‘ game.

The Panthers desperately tried to tie
the game as they went on the full offen-

sive, but Bison goalkeeper Laurie Purse

denied all their scoring attempts.

“I think they were a lot ﬁtter than
us and we just ran out of gas,” Fix said.

Sturk agreed.

“We.were not as sharp as we want-
ed to be,” Sturk said. “We certainly had
enough chances [to win ].”

V Purse had 10 saves for the Bison as
the Panthers attempted 18 shots. Ross
made six saves for Pitt as Bucknell
made 10 shot attempts.

Pitt’s next home game will be Sept.
14 against Big East opponent St. John’s
at Founders Field in Indianola, Pa.
Game time is 4 p.m. ’

St. Francis’ Gary Burke. Burke, who
had already received one yellow
card, received a second and was
automatically thrown out of the
game. '

“It was a 50/50 challenge and
the player kicked me on the
ground,” Carrizales said. “Their
team went crazy, and we got lucky
their guy got thrown out.”

Carrizales and Burke then start-
ing jawing with each other in front
of St. Francis’ bench. Yelling and
screaming ensued until Red Flash
head coach Fernando Barboto real-
ized that Burke had been thrown out
of the game. Barboto hushed the
crowd and players when he explod-
ed onto the field and started scream-
ing at the head official. The official
immediatelythrew Barboto out of
the game. Barboto refused to leave
until his assistants escorted him to

“None of that should have hap-

us.” '
Play continued aftera 15-minute

delay. The Panthers dominated the 2

game, but the players continued to
get more physical. Someone pushed
Churchill from behind into a water
jug on the sidelines. Pitt played on
and Mark Sikora and Nate
Montgomery scored two goals with-
