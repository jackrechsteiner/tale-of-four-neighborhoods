Backhoes on the North Shore are used to prepare a spot of land next to Heinz Field for the creation
of, the new Three Rivers Park. Supporters say that it will revitalize an under-used riverfront area.

Students for Reproducﬁvefreedom threw a birthday party in
the Wllliarn Pitt Union Tuesday night, complete with cheerleaders,
testimonials, ﬂying condoms and a candlelight vigil.

Members of the group celebrated the 29th anniversary of the
Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion in

_ the United States, but maintained a cautionary tone about the future.

Discussing President George W. Bush’s anti—abortion» stance
and the possibility that Bush will have the opportunity to appoint as
many as three Supreme Court justices during his term in office,
La’Tasha Mayes, "Students for Reproductive _Freedom’s vice presi-
dent, urged those in attendance to remain vigilant. 

“We take [the right to an abortion] for granted because we’v
never known life without it,” she said V

Shivering cheerleaders got the party ‘started, urging the crowd to
join them as they yelled and tossed condoms into ﬂie audience.

“Gimme a C! Gimme’ an H! Gimme an 0! Gimme an 1!

Gimme a C! Gimme an E! Yeah choice!” p
“Notthe church, not the state, women will decide our fate!”
A candlelight vigil followed, during which members of

_. Students for Reproductive Freedom read the stories of women who

had died or suﬁered at the hands of illegal abortionists.

One woman spoke in ﬁrst person about a. bright young college n
. strident; who upon ﬁnding out she was pregnant, had someone insert
‘ a rubber tube into her uterus to abort herfetus. Infection "set ill, and’
. the woman diedwith a $700 scholarship check'—'—_‘her hope for the
a future  her pocket As the readers ﬁnished the stories, each blew

out her candle. _‘ , . «

The party moved indoors to the Lower Lounge of the Union,
Where Francesca Cantarini,- the Western Pennsylvania ﬁeld director
of the National‘ Abortion ‘and Reproductive Rights Action League,

spoke abolit‘clinic' violence. ,

. ‘Cantarini said that since 1977, there have been more than
55,000 actsjof -violence at abortion clinics’  the natioll, includ-
ing seven murders, 41 bombings, 100 acid attacks, 12 assaults and

Democratic _ gtibematofnol  léartdinziote”
Rendell sat  for an interview with Pitt
News Editor in Chiq‘ Shannon McLaughlin
on Tuesday. Here irz,‘p‘an‘ two of the'.int’er-

- view, Rendell discusses the job m_tirket and

the possibility of a Pennsylvania“ Super
Bowl. 5  c 

The Pitt News: The economy is another
huge concern, particularly to seniors. . .
who are going to be entering the job mar-
ket in just a couple short months. A lot of
us want to stay in Pennsylvania, and are

‘ﬁnding the job market not so‘ great.

ER: Our two biggest enduring problems are
the condition of public _ education in
Pennsylvania and the state of our economy.
You know, we are 48th in economic growth
out of 50 states. We are 49th in population
growth. And we’ve now become the sec-
ond-oldest state in the union in the percent-
age of old people  Behind only Florida.
And it goes without saying that people aren’t

' coming here to retire for_‘our weather.
What is happening that’s made us the J

second-oldest state is we’re losing our young
people ...People who are graduating from
high school look around and ﬁnd the tradi-
tional economy jobs not to be here in abun-
dance. They leave. Young people who come
out of our colleges or our grad schools look

‘around for the new economy type jobs and
, see very few of them present They leave.

They go to Boston or Austin or Chicago or
L.A. or New York, and we’re losing very
valuable people. 4 e -

Your ﬁrst question was talking about the
cycle. High-‘tech companies want to come _

I -where -there is a good  of knowledge

workers  If there are no jobs, you can’t
stay here. - .
You can talk about how our two major

cities have become inﬁnitely more attractive I .

places for ' young people; A ‘Look at
Philade1phia«20 years ago  it was a place
where a young person didn’t want to be
around -as a single young person. Pittsburgh
20 years ago —.— gosh — that was one of the’.
last places young’ people would want to stay.

I But I  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh

, have developed in terms of amenities, arts

and culture, sports, a feeling of you know,
dynamism.  But if there are no jobs, it
doesn’t matter. You simply can’t stay there. I

. mean, maybe you stay there for six months ~

and bum around on your folks, but eventual-
ly you’ve got to hit the road, right? So that’s
the key. And it is\rea11y crucial.

TPN: Obviously you’ve done a lot in the
southeast and your popularity in the
Philadelphia region is kind of a given. But
what about the center of the state and

' what about the west?

ER: Well, that’s why there are campaigns.
You know, people always ask me that ques-
tion. And I say,’ ‘Hey guys, did you forget
about Tom Ridge?’ When he started out he
was known by 2 percent of the people ‘of the
state. ‘ ‘ ' »
_ I’m starting out known by well over 50
percent of people in the state. It’s the time-
tion of a campaign. That’s why you raise
money,‘ tlrat’s why you come to different
areas so often yourself._ That’s why you do
interviews. That’s why you do TV and radio
and direct-mail. _ S I ‘
And we know that I have a heavy bur-
den because Bob Casey’s name at least is
known by almostall of the state. T'hat’s why

1 We’re spending money fairly early in the.

campaign to begin the process of getting
known-by the voters. And that  be an on-
going process." . ~ ,
And I am bound and determined that I
am going to talk about two things. One, the
things that I’ve done that I think qualify me

‘ to be governor -— the experience that I’ve
‘had —- because, you know, running for
ofﬁce is like a job interview, but it’_s a job

interview with 11.8 million people. It is, and

-there’s 11.8 million people that have got to

know what /my experience is . . . So I have to

-lay my experience out, and not just by

resume, but the type of leadership experi-z,
ence I had Making tough decisions, dealing
with a 2.4 billion budget ... taking over the
city of Philadelphia at the worst time in its
history — the worst crisis, really, that any
American city’s ever faced._And having the

leadership skills, willingness to make tough - '

decisions, the ability to. attract the best
women, the best men to work for the gov-
ernment, all those things are what leader-
ship’s all about. ‘ ' '

So that’s category one. I’m going to tell I

people what I’ve done and why that qualiﬁes
me to be governor. And then two, I’m going
to tell people what plans I have for
Pennsylvania if I become’ governor. '

TPN: Some native Pittsburghers [might]

tend to look’ at Philadelphia as the city
that‘ gets ‘ all the attention from ‘

Harrisburg, and tlrere’s almost a natural
animosity toward the east. What do you
plan {to say to citizens of Pittsburgh to up
your western appeal? ' '

ER: Well, basically, a common-sense argu— '

I ment IfI were to become governor  the

ﬁrst thing people would be looking at in my
ﬁrst term as governor is whetherl was fair to
the state, or did Izgive all the money to
Philadelphia and the southeast. ‘
And I think even my critics would agree

" that I’m a pretty smart: fella. And ifI would

hope to bere-elected governor, I’d have to
probably» lean over [backward] -to demon- '
strate that I was fair to the entire state. So

Pitt installs electrical

generators to combat
recent power outages

LAUREN UNGER

Staff Writer

Students who arrived for classes in Trees Hall on Tuesday were
turned away from the dark building because of a power outage.

According to junior Nick Cooper, the lights came back on at
about 5 pm, but practices, clubs and classes scheduled for the
evening remained cancelled. '

“I wish they had let studentsback in the building once the power
came back on,” Cooper said “There seemed to be ample time to
have classes and clubs.” 1 '

According to University spokesman Robert Hill, the power out-
ages began at about 6 pm on Monday and power was restored to
most locations by 3 p.rrl. Tuesday. Any remaining buildings, includ-
ing Trees Hall, had power restored by midnight.

The outages affected Trees Hall, Scaife Hall, Fitzgerald Field
House and the Cost Sports Center. Although ‘flmctions were can-

“ celled in Trees Hallfor the evening, there were no losses or disrup-

tions in the research at Scaife. Hall, or in the men’s basketball game
against Syracuse at the Field House.

Hill said the cause of the power problems is still unknown. To
keep the future outages from interfering with activities until the prob-

lem ‘is ﬁxed, he said Pitt has installed emergency generators and is

pursuing other temporary solutions. -

' “We are still looking for a problem with the power lines, but in
the meantime we are arranging to have a backup line so we don’t
need the generator,” Hill said. , -

New North Shore park planned

Three Rivers Park, page 1

ples emerged from l8(months of information gathering.
The guidelines called for organizational use of the water-
front, to increase the connections between neighbor-
hoods and the rivers and to establish Pittsburgh’s bridges
asimportant aspects ofThreeRiversPark. _ A

The task force believes that Three Rivers Parkcan
help the city of Pittsburgh establish a renewed're1ation—
ship with. its bridges. Viewed as landmarks and . city
icons, the bridges connecting surrounding neighbor-
hoods to the park will receive special attention in an

attempt to. make them more prominent by painting and ‘
- illuminating them in as many dilferent ways_ as possible.

The park design calls for the division of the 25 acres

of land between the two stadiums into 15 parcels. The

Sports and Exhibition Authority will hold the Pirates and
Steelers accountable for the development of each parcel.
Failure to complete parcel development will result in the
teams forfeiting the rights back to the stadium authority
in“ accordance with a deal aﬁirmed last year.

The Steelers consulted with -the development ﬁrm
of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler about potential land buyers.

John Pelusi, a Pitt grad and representative of the
ﬁrm, said that the goal of the Steelers is to produce a
master plan for each parcel by Jan. 1, 2003, and that they
wanted construction to begin as soon as possible there-
after in order to keep pace witll previous plans. -

“Neither our ﬁrm nor the Steelers are real estate
developers,” he said.‘ “So we’ve contacted professionals

to come in and evaluate the lots and other developers to ,

start up the plans to develop businesses on the ‘parcels?-’

attendee feedback and incorpo-

rated it into a draft of the park. She said neighborhood
development committees gathered viewpoints from
“anyone with an opinion.” 1 ‘

, Macey, a lifelong ‘Steelers fan, said he thinks the
park is a idea because it will add togthe game-day
experience for fans and out of town visitors, despite the
fact that he will lose his glorious view. . .

“They have a similar complex like this in Baltimore,
with Camden Yards and the Ravens stadium right on the
waterfront ' surrounded by malls and tons of [restau-
rants],” he said. “Should this turn" out as nice as that, it
will certainly put Pittsburgh on the map.”

Shannon Dernarco, a North Side resident for two’
years, also said the park is a good idea, but questioned
how long it would last. i .

‘The North Side needs the business,” ‘she said
“This will give people a reason to [go there]. But the

‘North Side is not one of the better neighborhoods and

there is notmuch money circulating in the community.
So if people quit shopping there, who is going to support
it?” V . ’ ' ' 1
James  also expressed concern for the park’s
effect on the North Side ‘A resident there for more than
45 years, he summarized, the problems with Three
Rivers Park with oneword. _ ' -

“Parking,” he said. “Where are all these people

going to park? I’ll tell__you where. In my driveway and _

on my curb and in my backyard. Knowing the way this
city operates, they’ll put 15-minute meters everywhere.
Now what good will that do?” ‘_ A A

Barbara Bums, City Council’s North Side represen-

tative, was unavailable for comment at the time of pub- ‘

lication. , .

The construction period of Three Rivers Park'will
have an effect on the accessibility of North Side busi-
nesses near the site. Restaurants near the area experi-
enced a dwindling customer base during the building of
PNC Park and.Heinz Field, and owners and managers
are preparing for a similar situation.

’ Kara Tolrner, general manager of Firewaters North

' Shore Saloon 7 BBQ, located at l20,Federal Street -near

the home plate entrance of PNC Park, said the restau-
rant’ s business is still experiencing diﬁiculties because of
the construction of the newstadiums. V ~

“We don’t anticipate any new problems. because
there are still so many problems still going on now,” she
said. “We had no input with any of the plans. VV1th PNC
Park\ construction, people were relocated and that took
away the majority of our customer base.” ’ .

Tolrner said Firewaters was forced to close the past

.two winters due to constant construction and inaccessi-

bility. ’ s C
The restaurant reopened at the start‘ of the 2001

Pirates season in April and sales volume tripled, Tolrner -

 but the numbers steadily decreased as the sea-
son progressed. _ ’

Tolrner said Three Rivers Park will help North Side 0

businesses tremendously and is’ looking forward to its
completion because it will bring customers back.

‘The North Shore is not adestination yet,” she said.
“If there are more restaurants down here, more people

i will come down. We welcome the competition. It’s good

for us and for everyone._” _ .

- The largest challenge lying ahead ‘of the project’s_
completion, according to Schroeder, is to continue devel-
_oping—and expanding on the progress made‘ thus far.

“We carmot keep this project on the shelf,” she said.

.“We have momentum of all kinds going for us. We have

public, ﬁnancial, and governmental support. We have to

keep pushing ahead with the momentum that exists and p »

see this project through to the en .”

Rendell says he’ll root for the
Steelers — but not over the Eagles

Rendell, page 2

that’s number one. It just stands to reason.
And then the second answer is, if you
live out in southwestern Pennsylvania, if you
believe that Philadelphia has gotten so much
of the state’s resources that Pittsburgh hasn’t
gotten its fair share, well we haven’t had a
Philadelphia governor since 1914. So it’s not
Philadelphia governors that have been doing
that to you  And maybe, just maybe we
need a Philadelphia governor to give the
southwest its fairvshare.
Andlwouldgiveathirdparttothat
answer. The problem is, take education —

the problem is not that Philadelphia gets
money for education. The problem is that
Philadelphia’s got a deﬁcit in its school dis-
trict, Pittsburgh has a deﬁcit in its school dis-
tiict, Harrisburg has a deﬁcit, Erie has a
deﬁcit, Chester- and N orristown have a
deﬁcit, Altoona has a deﬁcit, Wilkinsburg is
almost broke.

So the problem is not who gets the most
funding. The problem is we haven’t had peo-
ple willing to adequately frmd anything.
That’s the problem.

You know, if we do the job of govern-
ment right, there will be adequate resources

-in the southwest, the southeast and the cen-

ter, the northeast and the northwest. We don’t

’ need to pit region against region, city against

suburbs, urban and rural against suburbs. We
don’t need those type of divisions. Those
type of divisions have been holding
Pennsylvania back for a long time.

TPN: That’s almost all I have.-What do
you think, Steelers? Steelers or Patriots?

ER: I do my sports show back home. I think
the likelihood of a Steelers-Eagles Super
Bowl is stronger in the west than it is in the
east [laughter].

V I think the Rams right now are probably
the best team in football. But I think the
Eagles are so hot right now —- they’re on
such a roll —— that the  have a decent
chance against the Rams, but are [by] no

means a sure winner. . .

I think the Steelers would have to really
play a bad game to lose to the Patriots.

And if it happens that it’s Steelers-
Eagles . . . The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette asked
me this about the Flyers-Penguins last
spring. And I said of course I wouldn’t be
neutral.

And of course I wo11ldn’t be neutral. I’d
be for the Eagles. If the people of soutl1west—
ern Pennsylvania want me to be neutral, they
have to elect me governor ﬁrst. Then I’ll be
neutral. If it’s Eagles-Steelers, no disrespect,
but I’ve been a season ticket holder of the
Eagles for 25 years, so I’d be mating for the
Eagles. ‘

But I am rooting ‘for the Steelers on

Sunday. Good question. New Orleans would

EDITORIAL

Pittsburgh must improve urban life

Over the last 50 years, Pittsburgh’s
population has declined steadily.

Every so often we hear how many
of us will graduate from school here and
immediately leave.

Interspersed with this is news about
local politicians who promise to revital-
ize life in Pittsburgh.

Many also say the city is on the
rebound, in its third renaissance. But to
continue this trend, much still needs to
be done. .

Building a solid infrastructure is
essential to keeping people in a city.
They are not going to stay if they feel
they would have a better quality of life
somewhere else. To this end, the city
must continue to work on making peo-
ple want to live in Pittsburgh.

The proposed riverfront park is a
good start. When the Riverlife Task
Force announced its plan to make use of
the riverfront for the park, some imme-
diately compared it to Central Park in
New York. This plan should be imple-
mented so that, one day, people can
enjoy life along the rivers, seeing them
as essential parts of the city and not
simply barriers to be bridged.

Revitalizing Downtown is also
essential for keeping people in
Pittsburgh. Currently, Pittsburgh has a
commuter—based Downtown, where
people go to work and then go home.
This is different from cities such as

Philadelphia, New York and Chicago
that have brought their city centers back
to life in recent years. .

The Fifth-Forbes Plan ——— even with
all its ﬂaws — was a good starting
point. Free parking Downtown in the
evening and on the weekends during the
holidays helped attract more people
there. But Downtown needs to be open
in the evenings and on the weekends.
People must be lured to do things there.

There must also be housing options,
both Downtown and along the rivers,
where people can live affordably.

Pittsburgh needs more areas like
Walnut and Carson streets, main streets
where people will congregate for shop-_

' ping and entertainment. It also needs

distinctive restaurants and shops —
ones that can be found nowhere else.

Some neighborhoods in the city,
such as Shadyside and the South Side,
have already been revitalized. Because
of riverfront trails and an increased
emphasis on parks, recreational oppor-
tunities in the city are greater.

But once people want to stay, they
need to be able to stay for a long time.
This is where companies and the
University both come into the picture.
Pittsburgh is a corporate town, yet many
young people leave. Local corporations
and the University need to sponsor —
and market — job fairs for local corpo-
rations to attract young people.

Television lies. This should not
be news to anyone who bothers to

control, over what one ingests,
digests and excretes is a cry for help
in the way yelling “Help!” in a real-
ly loud voice is. Generally, people
— women, as well as a rising male
population —who starve, binge or
purge feel the need to exert control
over their lives, which they can only

More specifically,
one of the crimes that
television commits --
and keeps committing —
is its depiction of eating
disorders. Movies of the
week, after—school spe-

 

do through rigid rules.

~ tute vary from person to
person, but in general,
are as follows: Anorexics
want to control chaotic
situations, bulimics want

cials and extremely to live up to the.social
touching episodes of expectations of,’-having
“Full House” pump a SydneyBe1~gman both a healthy appetite
false image of people Columnist and a toned physique and

with eating disorders irrﬁ)

overeaters seek comfort

living rooms across the
nation.

Television fails to ‘recognize
that most people with these disor-

ders — like most people with‘ drug»

habits — are in some control of their
lives. They are not all waifs in need
of hospitalization or athletes and
supermodels run amok. “Functional
addict,” a term applied to those who
hold jobs and lead relatively normal
existences despite drug problems,
also pertains to.those who have eat-
ing disorders.

To clarify, it is not that an eating
disorder is a positive thing. It’s not
a hobby or pastime like, say, golf.
Obviously, disorders including

anorexia,‘bulimia, overeating or any‘

combination of the three —— for they

" often come in pairs — are detrimen—\

tal to the health, well-being and
sanity of anyone with it. ’
Fanatical control, or lack‘ of

in food when no other

outlet is available to them. ‘
Television shows none of this,
none of the underlying causes or

‘motivations that relate to food. The

whitewashed version follows a’ spe-

cific pattern. Namely, the relatively,

healthy "person begins to diet,
becomes skeletal overnight, then
after a touching confrontation with
a friend, coach or family member
goes back on the straight and nar-
row. “ ' . - .—

Forinstance, “Full House” had
older sister, D.J., worry, starve and
then recover in the course of an
episode. Countless other movies of
the week detailing the lives of
actresses, models, figure skaters‘
and gymnasts do the same.

With the exception of those akin
to “The Karen'Carpenter Story,”
few show hospitalization, intra-
venous feeding or death. Even the

The rules they insti-

Eating disorders badly portrayed on TV

ashy skin and thinning‘ hair that
accompany anorexia are censored.
Nowhere on television are the atro-
phying muscles, the dizziness or the
feeling of absolute terror that many
have when confronted with a meal.
‘Also absent are the smaller
casualties. One example ‘is the dis-
comfort of sitting down on wooden
and metal chairs becausetailbones
grind into these surfaces. Another is
the bad acne, rotting teeth and
bleeding esophagus li-ning bulimics
get from exposing sensitive parts of
their body to stomach ‘acid.

Similarly, television overlooks the

snide looks and condescending
manner of those who perceive all
eating disorders -— but especially
overeating — as weakness or lazi-
ness. ‘ '

Most. importantly, these repre- 

sentations fail to give a glimpse of
the length and breadth of recovery.
Then again, most revolutions are
not televised.-Recovery is not a
goal , .
It’s a process that lasts a life-
time. Alcoholics always remain
alcoholics. Some are ‘recovering
alcoholics, some are users. Eyen if
theyare not drinking, the addiction
is there, the temptation is there.
Anorexics are always anorexics,
whether they weigh 80 or .180
pounds, - — ‘

Eating _and weight are not”the_

issue. Self—perception and self-
respect are. ‘And these are two
things that are sorely missing-from
regularly scheduled programming.

Anti-Zionism is not racism

In response to Mark Shabason’s letter to the edi-
tor titled “Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism” (Jan. 18),
I disagree. Zionism was a movement started in the
late 19th century to establish a homeland for the
Jews. After World War II, many Jews immigrated to
Palestine and Israel was founded with the help and
support of the United States. Israelis did try to incor-
porate the Palesti.nians~into their government, but-
needless to say, this hasn’t worked. Basically, the

Jews of Israel took that land from the Palestinians. I
The Palestinians’ are fighting to get their homes back.

To put things in another perspective, groups of
people have previously taken_land from other groups
of people — most notably, the United States was
founded on the land of the Native Americans. Sadly,
the Native Americans were subsequently _slaugh-

tered. In retrospect, from'the I/collelctive conscious- '
-- ness of our country, many of us may look at this time

shamefully, but that doesn’t makeanyone anti-

You can judge for yourself the morality of the-
Zionist movement. I’m sure Israelis find it moral and‘
Palestinians don’t. The United States‘ foreign policy

~ supporting Zionism and Israel is largely responsible

for our current situation,’ in my understanding.

. In conclusion, I think Israel was aibad idea (call I.‘
that anti-Zionism if you will), and, more relevantly -_

to the United States, I think the U.S. foreign policy
toward Israel was a terrible idea. But I am not, and in

Wednesday night’s basketball, game

at Fitzgerald Field House was a meeting .

of two desperate teams. V
For both the Pittsburgh Panthers
and the Georgetown Hoyas, last night’s
matchup was a must-win. Both teams
rode three-game losing streaks, and

both teams sat near the bottom of the

Big East standings. '

‘ Most importantly, both teams need-_ '

ed. momentum heading into the home
stretch of the season. . .

' In the end,'the Hoyas scored a huge
road victory by, slowing down the
tempo in the second half and securing a
73-56 victory over the Panthers. . ,

Following the game, Pitt head
coach Traci Waites tried to name the
causes for Pitt’s loss. , i ,

“Intensity, turnovers... we just did-

_n’t make good decisions,” Waites said.

This was -the second contest this
season involving the two teams, and
Pitt’s lone Big East victory of the sea-
son came over the Hoyas on Jan. 5 in

vWashington D.C., in a close; 63-61 win.‘
Panthers,

Unfortunately for the
Wednesday’s game’ would prove notto

. be that close. ‘
Both" teams struggled offensively .

early in the game, and with 14:36 to go,
Georgetown called a 30-second timeout
with an 8-6 lead. The Hoyas soon
turned, their offensive woes around,
going on an 8-0 run to‘ increase their
leadto 18-8. , _ .
Pitt responded by speeding up the
pace of the game. The Panthers ran the

.ball up court in transition and threw

long outlet passes.
At the end of the first half, the

' Gecrgetown lead was cut to 29-25. '

. Pitt ended the game with 10 fast

break points, and Waites_acknowledged
Pitt’s transition basketball as one of the
few strengths the team displayed
against Georgetown. 5 .

“We had momentum and were mak-
ing good decisions when we were run-
ning,” Waites said.

Pitt started off the second half with
back-to-back unanswered three pointers‘
by freshman guard Haley Harguth, forc-
ing Georgetown to call a timeout just 45
seconds into the half, trailing by one. ,

Laine Selwyn grabbed two quick

steals in the open court, enabling Pitt to j
V ‘enjoy a 34-31 lead, two minutes into the
. second half.

But then the ﬂoor fell out‘ from
under the Panthers. . , .
' ‘ After trading baskets for two min-
utes, the Hoyas went on an 8-0 run to
grab a 50-40 1ead.,The Panthers tried to

made a layup with just one minute, 40
seconds‘ left in the first half. Pitt had just

i ‘ come back from an 18-8 deﬁcit to cut the

lead to .22-21. ’ . .
The Panthers" ten—point comeback
included a 7-0 rim, which started with
5:30 left in the ﬁrst half. Freshman guard
Haley Harguth and junior guard Laine

‘Selwyn both hit three pointers. Junior

guard Brooke Stewart came up _witl1_ a
steal, which she converted into one free
throw,-which set up Stufﬂet’s basket, get-
ting the Panthers to within one. , '
The Panthers had a chance to take the

' lead when Harguth came up with "a steal

but the Panthers were unable to capitalize.
They turned the ball over twice in the last
45 seconds. " -

This'lead to four straight points by
Zsuzsanna Horvath. Harguth answered
Horvath’s- scores. with a three but the
Hoyas came right back with a buzzer-
beating half-court shot by Hoyas guard
Mary Lisicky, which put Georgetown up

‘ 29-24 at the end of the first half. -

, “It’s funny because the same thing
happened at Georgetown,” Pitt head
coach Tracy Waites said. “It was like the
replay of a movie because Amy [Kunich]

did the same thing, but itwas us that
made that shot; we had the momentum

and we were up by 15 at the half.”

“It I was definitely a ‘momentum
swinger for them because we were com-
ing back on them,” Harguth said. ‘

After the last-minute breakdown‘ in’

claw their wayback into the game, but Georgetown
played an effective, patient ha1f—court offense and
dominated underneath the glass to match Pitt basket
for basket.

The deficit proved to be too much for the

Panthers, and Georgetown took advantage of some I

careless transition turnovers to extend their lead and
end the game with a 17-point victory.

Georgetown center Zsuzsarma Horvath led in
scoring with a game—high 24 points on 11 of 17 shoot-
ing. Selwyn led the Panthers with 16 points, 10 assists,
5 steals and 6 rebounds, but said that she would glad-
ly trade her individual stats for a Panther win.

“Every time I’ve had a double-double we’ve lost,”
Selwyn said. “I’d rather have no points and no assists
and win the game.”

Brooke Stewart added 13 for the Panthers at the
forward position, and Harguth scored 12 points on
four three-pointers, but that was not enough to make
up for Pitt’s 22 turnovers.

Those turnovers proved costly as Georgetown
scored 29 points off of turnovers, Georgetown out
rebounded Pitt 52-31, and they scored 19 second-
chance points to Pitt’s 4.

Waites’ disappointment following the game was
evident.

"‘They needed this win and we needed this win,
and inthe end they won because they played a more
strategic game than us.”

Pitt will host Syracuse on Saturday at Fitzgerald
Field House before traveling to Miami on February

 2nd to take on the Hurricanes. Harguth echoed the

  

 
         

team’s sentiments when she stated that the only way
for the team to turn their season around is to stay pos-
itive.

“I think we’ve proven to ourselves that we’re a
very good team and that when we '
play well, we can compete with anybody. We just have
to get into that mindset and get our conﬁdence back.”

Grapplers dominate quad meet I

Pinned, page 15

Rich Boden kept Pitt’s winning streak
going with a 15-8 victory over Brian Bricker
at 165 pounds. Boden’s victory was fol-
lowed by a forfeit by F&M to Catullo at 174
pounds. I

Once again, Pitt yielded its only loss at
184 pounds, where F&M’s R.P. Norley
scored a 16-0 tech fall in the third period over
the Panthers Steve Selcher, which made the
score 27-5.

But Pitt got back on track quickly with
back-to-back pins for the second time in the
meet. Sandberg and Lininger both pinned
their opponents in less than two minutes.

In the Panthers’ closest meet of the day,
they defeated Eastern Michigan 36-12.

Continuing the trend from the previous
match, Thornton started the Panthers oﬂ°
with a‘ pin. Thornton pinned Eastern
Michigan’s Gunterrnan in 1:18, which was
followed by a 9-2 decision by Arnistade over
Zac Pyles.

Pitt was quickly out to a 9-0 lead, but a
17-2 tech fall by‘Eastem Michigan’s Darnell
Rufﬁn over Villecco cut the Panthers’ lead to
four.

Giovinco and Doll proved to be too
much again as both had consecutive pins at
149 and 157 pounds, which gave the
Panthers a 21-5 lead. Giovinco pinned Josh

Wiles in just less than a minute and Doll col-
lected his third pin of the day in 3:56 over
Keon Suggs. ‘ ' V

Eastern Michigan’s Brett Fihnore had to
default to Fronhofer due to injury. Eastern
Michigan’s Ed Magrys had a 13-6 decision
over Catullo, followed by an 11-1 major
decision by Adam Gilmore over Pitt’s
Selcher. ‘

Pitt’s anchors successfully completed
the meet as Sandberg scored a 144 major
decision over Dane Bonnigson, which was
followed by a 15-0 technical fall in the sec-
ond period by Lininger over Travis Kraft.

World needs to 
realize that
Tyson is a fraud

. Paul, page 15

Expansion has diluted the league’s talent.
The league’s image is tarnished and
making the playoffs even longer by pos-
sibly stretching them deep into July,
could be suicidal.

- With a hearing with the Nevada
State Athletic Commission scheduled for
Jan. 29 quickly approaching, Mike
Tyson has once again made a fool of
himself.

In case you haven’t- seen it, Tyson ~ 9

and heavyweight champion Lennox
Lewis were at a news" conferenceto hype
their impending April bout. Tyson said
that both sides agreed on a face-off but

. when Tyson walked over to Lewis,

Lewis’ bodyguard shoved him.

Tyson, standing about two feet away
from the bodyguard, threw a left hook,
which missed by about three feet.

I am as big of a boxing fan as there‘

is and I’ll be the first person to become.

incensed when somebody says that the
whole sport is fixed, but this incident had’,
to be a set-up. Even though Tyson is
washed up, there’s no way that he could

have missed that punch, if he was seri-,.

ously trying to attack the man.

 It is now a prerequisite for thereto”
be some type of melee at a prep-ﬁght
press conference. But this mess, which,

was not done for publicity or because of
animosity took place because Mike-
Tyson hasn’t trained for the April ﬁght?
and for the fact that this ﬁght will never
happen. -’ ‘

Some people say, “Never say never,”
but I’m saying it.

Tyson had the chance to be the most '
dominating heavyweight ever, but that ~

was 15 years ago. He is now in his late
thirties and while Lewis has beaten every
young pedigree from David Tuaj, to

Hasim Rahman, Tyson has fought a wide ,

array of journeymen.

Tyson won’t ﬁght Lewis because he '
can’t beat him. He couldn’ t beat Evander A

Holyﬁeld in three tries and if he were to
ﬁght Lewis and lose, then he would
never be able to recover the ftmds that he
makes in ﬁghts against the likes of Frans
Botha and Andrew Golata.

On top of his ﬁghting woes, Tyson,
who served three years in 1992 for a rape
conviction, is on the verge of being tried
on a separate rape case.

Tyson is a criminal and an unstable
entity. His skills are worn, much like his
soul and with less speed, no direction
and no discipline, Tyson will never be a
champion again — unless he ﬁghts John
Ruiz.

Leave NBA playoffs alone

a Paul, page 18. q

The sad thing is, until the boxing

lemans realize that he is all hype, Tyson ,

will linger around. It’s a shame that there
are so few boxing enthusiasts out there
that know just how big of a fraud he is.

- Yesterday, the NFL’s director of
football operations, Gene Washington,
ﬁned Philadelphia Eagles defensive end
Hugh Douglass $35,000 for the hit that
he laid on Bears quarterback Jim Miller,
which knocked him out of last weekend’s
playoff game. 3

The play occurred after Miller had
thrown an interception, which subse-
quently made him a defensive player.
Miller moved toward Damon Moore,
who had made the interception and
Douglass, who assumed the role as a
blocker, took Miller down-

There was no penalty on the ﬁeld.

Football is_ the most physical sport
out there. The NFL has done everything

  
   

possible to protect its quarterbacks and in
doing so has taken away from the integri-
ty of the game. Football is ‘a ' game of
instinct and the NFL has done its best to
handicap defenders.

Douglass did not plant his hehnet
under Mi]ler’s chin. He did not rap Miller
up and drive to the turf either. Douglass
‘simply took Miller out of the play, like he
was supposed to do, and it was the frozen
ﬁeld that did the damage.

' It’s one thing to protect the stars of
your league. I can see Michael Jordan or
Brett Favre getting favorable calls but
Miller'is a bum, whi1ef'Douglass is a pro

0 bowler.

. The NFL can ﬁne players all that
they want, but I can guarantee that
$35,000 won’t keep Douglass from
going even harder at Kurt Warner this
‘weekend.

Pitt News. '
