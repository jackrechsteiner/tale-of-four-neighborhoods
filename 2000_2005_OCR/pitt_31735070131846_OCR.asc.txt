Project looks to bring arts to Pittsburgh

KATHERINE BRINTON
Staff Writer

Vibrant portraits gazed watchfully from their can-
vases at The Andy Warhol Museum on‘ Saturday
evening while a crowd of people with names often seen
as piintedtext in “Entertainment Weekly” were dressed
to the nines to discuss Pittsburgh’s next renaissance.

Hollywood heavyweights and local. leaders gath-
ered to combine their collective forces at Pittsburgh’s
first Entertainment ‘Summit, aimed at utilizing the
city’s cultural institutions.

Steeltown Entertainment Project, a newly formed‘

non—proﬁt organization comprised of writers, actors,
directors and entertainment professionals, hosted the
summit. _
Their goal is to turn Pittsburgh into a “thriving arts
and entertainment community” by providing support
and guidance to a variety of entertainment artists, who,

‘ like themselves, struggled at one point. ~

“If I could just help someone to fund their next
project, buy their next meal or get more studio space,
this would be worth it,” said David Conrad, who

costars on NBC’s “Miss Match.” Conrad’s Pittsburgh
ties, shared by others at the event, prompted him to
sign up for the Steeltown Project. *

“It’s all here,” Conrad said as he quoted from the
film “The Deer Hunter.” According to Conrad,
Pittsburgh holds so many untapped resources, the
greatest being its people. _

Jamie Widdoes, “Animal House” actor and direc-
tor of ‘.‘My Wife and Kids,” believes that the greatest
unutilized resource is the collective energy "of
Pittsburgh residents. ‘

“We all have a common bond, Franco Harris’s
Immaculate Reception and Bill Mazeroski —— we

' should draw on this,” VV1ddoes said.

Pittsburgh is a city brimming with firsts.

Thelfirst “moving picture” theater — known as a
nickelodeon — was founded in downtown Pittsburgh.
Also, being home to the first public radio station
(KDKA) and the first community-owned television
station (WQED) identifies, the town as a pioneer of
entertainmentraccording toa documentary shown at
Saturday’s event. A

Although Pittsburgh was once a Mecca for talent,

the city has seen little of the $130 billion revenue gen-

erated from the industry. Steeltown, still in its begin-
-ning phases, plans to bring back a portion of the multi-

billion dollar money pool by connecting new and
established artists to generate material that can be sold
to production companies, networks and producers.‘

‘ To do this, Steeltown plans to bring workshops and
instruction to Pittsburgh in a Sundance-style event. Its
purpose is_to help develop artistic vision and skill in
screen and script writing.

If there is a strong desire coming from community
leaders, an industry can be created and projects incu-
bated, Eric Gold said. Gold, manager of people such as
VV1ll»Ferrell and Jim Carrey, said Steeltown will be suc-
cessful in stimulating production.

Drawing young entertainment professionals to the
city is essential, according to Peter Ackerinan, screen-
writer of “Ice Age.” P '

“Many college students are, graduating and leaving
the city to go to places like Boston and Los Angeles,”
he said. According to Ackerrnan, Steeltown has the
potentialto draw a younger generation of entertainers
to Pittsburgh and keep them here.

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, October 28, 2003

Authors addressrace

HALI FELT
Staff Writer

Jamie Dawson was upset.

“This school sucks,” she said.
“Yesterday there was an article in
[The Pitt News] with people com-
plaining about diversity. And now
there’s no one here.”

Dawson is the education chair of
Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Society
Inc., and the “here” was in the
Cathedral of Learning on Friday‘
night, in a room that the society
reserved for a lecture on the nature
of friendships between black and
white women.

Slated to speak were Kathy
Russell and Midge Wilson, co-
authors of the books “The Color
Complex” and “Divided Sisters.”

Russell and Wilson began the
evening by talking about how they
got together to write their first
book, the “Color Complex.” The
book was Russell’s idea; she had
wanted to write a book about
“b1ack-on—black” discrimination for
some time because she saw that
there did not appear to be a signifi-
cant piece of research on the sub-
ject. Through working on the book
together, they became friends and
are, as they said, proof that a black
woman and a white woman can do
so.

That is what their second book,
“Divided Sisters,” deals with, and
also had to do with why Theta Nu
Xi asked the women to speak — to
promote cultural and ethnic under-
standing on Pitt’s campus. Other
than the sorority sisters, only about

eight students showed up for the
event.

But the small turnout did not
stop the group from engaging in a
lively conversation about the vari-
ous issues facing women within
their own respective cultures and
between races.

After Russell and Wilson dis-
cussed the ideas of critical race the-
ory and social inequality, they
opened the floor, and a discussion
about the experiences that the
women in the room had had with
friends or acquaintances of other
races quickly became the topic of
discussion. _

One young woman spoke about
her best friend in high school, say-
ing, “She used to tell me that I was
the whitest black girl that she knew.
I don’t think she really understood
what that meant to me.”

That comment led to a discus-
sion about the stereotypes people of
various races have about each other.
Among the topics discussed were
intelligence, sexuality and clothes.

Many of the black women in the
room expressed a concern about
black people being discriminated
against, in terms of intelligence, by
other black people and white people
alike. One talked about how she was
afraid to take honors classes in high
school for fear of being labeled
uppity by her black friends and
being looked down upon by the
mostly white students in the classes.

“Just because I’m African
American doesn’t mean I’m stupid,”
Russell said in response, “or that

Sierra Club rallies near Pitt,
protests Bush’s policies

LAURA JERPI
Staff Writer

Bill Arthur wants to clean up
the environment, but he thinks
President George W. Bush, is stand-
ing in his way. '

The slogan “Save a tree, remove
a bush,” was plastered all over
posters Sunday at the “Take Back
the Earth” rally at the Oval Grove
in Schenley Park.

About 100 people gathered
there to protest the way the Bush
administration’s environmental
policies are harming Pennsylvania
communities. The Sierra Club, a
nationwide grass-roots organization
with a strong focus on environmen-
tal protection, sponsored the event.

According to Arthur, who is the
northwest regional coordinator for
the Sierra Club, the Bush adminis-
tration is attempting-to prevent the
public from participating in acts to
clean up and protect the nation’s
clean air and water.

The standards for clean air and
water protection are weakening, he
said, adding that the Bush adminis-

tration is trying to make it more dif-
ficult to hold the government

responsible for polluting the air and,

water. A
There were five different speak-

ers at the rally, including Penn-

Future’s- Heather. Sage.

“Dirty air kills more people
than drunk driving and homicide
combined,” Sage said“

Other speakérsgave the audi— '

ence tips on ways they can help to
improve the environment, including
registering. to vote and not idling
their vehicles. After the rally, most
of the crowd split into groups to
walk through Squirrel Hill and edu-
cate the community about
Pen_nsylvania’s environmental prob-
lems. The groups worked to explain
to residents their reasons for dis-
agreeing with the Bush administra-

.tion’s environmental ‘problems.

Clare Sierawski, the public rela-
tions director of Pitt’s Free the
Planet Club,. said she hoped the
walkers would “make people more
aware of the environmental degra-
dation going on becauseof the Bush
administration.”

Stereotypes may cause higher
self—esteem levels, Wilson says

Theta Nu Xi, page 2

I’m what you see on the five o’clock
news. It’s horrible that blackness
cannot be associated with smart-
ness.”

According to Wilson, despite
these stereotypes, ‘ or perhaps
because of them, black women
“tend to have a much higher level of
self-esteem than white women.”

Russell then related a story
about listening to a radio call—in
show when women’s cattiness was
being discussed. A black ‘woman
called in to say, “I don’t hate. Girls
be hatin’ on me,” and when the‘ DJ
asked her why, she replied that it

was because she made good money
and was fine.

“I thought she was gonna say

she made like six figures or some-
thing,” Russell said. “And'then she
says, ‘I make $45,000 a year, I’m
five—foot—six, and I’m a size 18.’
Only a black woman could say
that.”

Although the two speakers had
little to offer by way of solution to
the problem they discussed, they

appeared to find power in simply.

remaining conscious of the differ-
ences that exist. :7
“We just have to talk about these
things so that [the situation]
becomes manageable,” Wilson said.

Candy, costumes and paranoid adults

This Friday, little ghouls and

goblins from sea to shining sea will A

abandon. their .rigorous grade-
school curriculafor a little good-
hearted revelry‘ and candy con1
sumption. .
_It’s Halloween again, and the

kiddies are ready to havela little.

fun. But if some, grumpy parents
have their way, revelry will be our-
tailed or even eliminated in some
public school districts. 8

There has always been opposi-
tion from a small group of ‘funda-
mentalist Christians who see the
holiday as a celebration of Satanism
and\ paganism. To a little kid,

I . though, Halloween just represents

Smarties and makeup. It’s the par-
ents who put the notion of evil in
their poor heads. However, if a par-
ent has legitimate religious objec-
tions, it’s within their rights to keep
the kid from celebrating. The onus
should be on them, though, and not
the school. ’ ‘

But the plain old anti-fun senti-
ment is spreading like caramel
candy left in the sun. I

Some parents claim schools
shouldn’t be supporting a commer-
cial behemoth. Halloween has, after
all, become ‘ second only to
Christmas in consumer spending.
Parading kids around in homemade
masks and giving them a few sug-

ary snacks is hardly forcing them to
participate in an orgy of expendi-
ture. A

Other parents object to sacrific-
ing valuable class time to some-
thing as frivolous as costumes and
SWCCIIBS.‘ Heaven forbid little
Johnny miss 45 minutes of instruc-
tion —' that could make all the dif-
ference in what boarding schoolhe
gets into in eighth grade. That time
he wasted eating candy, dressed
like SpongeBob and fraternizing
with other seven—year—olds could
cost him Yale.

Yet other grown-ups ‘object to
candy being passed out in schools.
"We are, after all, in the midst of a
childhood obesity epidemic. Of
course, any in—-shape kid who eats
decently and "doesn’t have a
PlayStation 2 controller grafted to
her little paw is immediately going
to become horrendously fat after
eating four fun—sized Snickers bars
once a year. '

Halloween is a fun little waste
of about an hour at the end of a
school day once a year. It’s a secu-

«lar holiday, motivated by nothing

but fun. It’ls.about nothing more
than participating in fundamentally
kid activities — eating junk and
playing dress-up. It’s a shame some
adults have to ‘be such witches
about the whole ordeal.

It’s the ﬁrst week of football season and

the Eagles are playing the -Buccaneers.

~ Being the loyal Birds fan that I am, I decide
to have some ﬁiends over to watch the game
and cheer on my favorite Eagles wide

receiver, James Thrash.

It’s supposed to be a total-
ly innocent evening. I’m a pret-
ty level-headed person. I'have
no intention of drinking, espe-

up early for class. ,

Well, at least my intentions
are good A friend of mine
comes over with a case of beer
and the cheapest bottle of
vodka that money can buy.

“Grab ‘a drink,” he tells -
me.

“No; I’m not drinking
tonight,” I innocently explain; He glares at
me.

“I brought this bottle for you as a house-
warming gift. You’re drinking!” Well, I’rn
not one to be ungrateful, so twist my arm,
why don’t ya? By halftime, I’m hammered
This Eagles junkie doesn’t handle her booze
well. As. the game rolls on and the Eagles’
playing gets worse, the more set I am in
drowning my sorrows. '

The game ends, and the crowd clears
out, except for a few stragglers who are as
obliterated as I. The rest of the night is most-

The next moming, I’m awakened with
an overwhelming sense of nausea —-you
know, the feeling of having a pool of cheap-
ass vodka festering in the bottom of your
stomach———and guilt. “I_ookatyou!”Ithink
“You got wasted on a freaking Monday

the night before, and decide that showing up

' for an AA meeting would probably be

urmecessary. I had a kick—ass time. Sure, my
apartment looks like a disaster area, and the
Eagles lost, but I had a lot of laughs with
some good friends. I decide,
isn’t that what college is really
about? Doing what you’d
never be able to get away with
in the real world?

College is the precious
four years where you can get
away with stupid stunts like
getting wasted on a Monday
night, rolling out of bed just
before noon the next day, and
not having to wony about any
too—serious consequences, like
getting ﬁred. Two years from
now, I’ll never remember a sin-
gle detail of what happened in that class, but
I know I’ll remember how much ﬁm I had
with my friends during the ﬁrst Eagles game
junior year of college. In the grand scheme
of things, which is more important?rI have
the rest of my adult life to be responsible. For
now, I choose to enjoy the last shred of
“childhood” I have. Sure, I’ll get my work
done and keep my grades up to standards
where I won’t have to face the wrath of my
parents, but I’m fully content to be immature
and have a lot of kick—ass times that I may or
may not remember fully with the people
who make college great — friends.

As Tom Petty says, “Quit worrying
about the stupid things. You have four years
to be irresponsible. Relax, work is for people
with jobs. You’ll never remember the class
time, but you’ll remember time hanging out
with your friends. So stay out late, go out on
a Tuesday night when you have a paper due
Wednesday. Spend money you don’t have.
Drink until sumise. The work never ends.
College does!” And naturally, what your par-
ents don’t know will never hurt them.

Colleen Bayus loves the Eagles, and so
should you. E—mail herat wb2357@pimedu

Woodland thievery best dealt with by vigilante justice

The weekend before last, my friend Sam and I
decided to head out of the city. We grabbed our pipes,
some tobacco, made a few tuna sandwiches, and were
on our way to Beam’s Rock, an old high school retreat

of mine on Laurel Mountain, about ninety minutes

east of Oakland. , A

Here is a tale of thievery and
vengeance in which the law should have
played no part. _

The drive was good. In the stretches
past Ligonier, the trees bowed over the
road, creating a canopy that’s especially
beautiful in the fall. Once on the rocks, we
relaxed for a while but when we heard the
friends who were supposed to meet us
would be about an hour late, we decided
to hike around for a bit to pass the time.

We stuffed all that we had into Sam’s
fairly nice backpack: a jar of mayonnaise,
some bread, my journal, my pipes and my
keys. We then hid the bag in some bushes and went to
explore the area. We climbed around, then returned to
ﬁnd a family on the main face. We talked with them
about Pitt and then went to grab the bag, which was
gone. ‘

There had been a couple on the rock when the
family arrived. When they left, the family said, the
man — a tall, blonde guy with camouﬂage pants on
— walked into the bushes and grabbed a bag. They
had assumed it was his. This wasn’t too long ago, so
Sam and I ran down the trail after them.

On the way, we passed our friends, who had just
seen the couple leave. When we got to the parking
area, they were gone, but they were nice/stupid

enough to leave my keys on a rock by my car. Sam
and I jumped inand sped after them, leaving skid
marks. in the gravel lot. It only took a few minutes,
going 70 mph on windy, gravel roads, to catch up with
a car holding a couple. The man matched the descrip-
tion given to us by the family.

I swung my car in front of them to cut \
them off. We got out, walked up to their V

‘ window and explained that someone had
stolen our bag. We asked if they could pop
their trunk to prove that it wasn’t them.
The man would later claim to be fright-
ened and confused at this point. He said,

ing about, and began to roll up his win-
dow. I put my hands on top of the window.
As he began to drive away, I yelled at him
and pulled down on the window. It shat-
tered. Glass ﬂew everywhere, and blood
began to trickle down my hands.

We got back into the car and began to trail them.
I called 911 and read them the license plate number.

They said they’d send an ofﬁcer to the scene. Just -

before the main road, I ﬂew around and cut them off
once again, better this time. Sam said, “I just want my
bag back,” and the man, a bit ﬂustered, replied, “All
right, I did ﬁnd a bag.” And, sure enough, there in the
trunk was Sam’s bag. ' ‘

Things should have ended there. They stole from
us; we got back what was stolen. Things were basi-
cally resolved. We could have climbed around for
longer, and I wouldn’t have had to _be late for work.

But,\ they called the police over the broken window, '

and our officer was already on his way.

“No,” he didn’t know what we were talk- --

What followed was the mundane tediousness of
formalities. We needed two officers, seeing as the
theft occurred in the woods and the property damage
on the road. They were separate offenses. One ofﬁcer
bandaged my hands, and the other explained that a
refusal to pay for the window on my part would lead

to a crirriinal mischief charge and a $380 ﬁne. And as.

cool as it would be to be officially mischievous, I did-
n’t need that. I Were Sam to counter with the theft

charge, then we would all have to come back out there i

to work it out in court. , -
One of the officers complained of us calling him

out towards the end of his shift, and when I expressed\

my confusion over being threatened with a charge,
considering the circumstances, he explained that it

was I who called him to look at my trouble. He didn’t,

volunteer to be there. V
Eventually, I agreed to pay half the cost of,» the

window. The ofﬁcer explained that Sam had two years -

to ﬁle the theft charge but added that any attempt to do
so at so late a date would make him mad, and he
would find every possible charge to throw at us.

I’m not going to say that cops suck. In general, I
think we’d all ‘agree, they’re pretty useful. But, it
should be remembered that, when it comes down to it,
they act more like people than instruments of the law.
They, like most members of bureaucracies, are more
likely to act or not act due to boredom or frustration
than due to the grand principles they’re supposed to

enforce. And because" of this, more often than not, -

they bring more confusion than resolution.

Troubled manfinds solace building, avoiding family

During the most awkward, pimply
phase of my life, my father could usual-
ly be found in the creek across the street.

The divorce was imminent, looming
over all our heads like a nightmarish,
cloudy specter. Everyone was on edge,
especially my mother, as every time my
dad entered the house, he’d ﬁnd_himself

, under the hot interrogation light:

“Shimon, why you do? What are
you the coming home _so late? Where
you beaaaan?!”

His answer was always the same.
He gruffly shrugged his shoulders and,
as he tried to shufﬂe away from the spit-
ting hydra, he muttered, almost inaudi-
bly:

“Jiffy Lube.” Always Jiffy Lube.

Immediately after, he’d have a din-
ner plate zip past his head, crash against
the wall, and a ﬁght, entirely in Hebrew,
sounding like two chickens hastily
clucking at each other, would break out.

The staunch, herrnit-like, balding
bear that was my father needed a
release. Growing weary and crazed from
the clumsy cycle of hate-repulsion-

— make up-quiet—repulsion-repulsion, he

evaded my mother by’ beginning the

- project that would change all our lives:

he started building a beaver dam.

Initially, it was a small endeavor.
He’d save himself a few hours of argu-
ments by going to the creek, piling
together a few small rocks as a rnini-bar- ‘
rier against the oncoming tides, and
every so often gaily splashing his feet in
the cool stream while plotting his
revenge. With any luck, by
the time he returned, my
mother was asleep on the
couch or too ensconced in
the latest Seinfeld to care.
His reverse siege was work-
ing splendidly.

But then the dam

    

usually never went, reacting with a mix-
ture of shock and perplexity, since he
rarely spoke to us and we’d forgotten»
what he lookedlike. He’d nod his head
apologetically and lightly penguin-shuf-
ﬂe away.

He’d spend every weekend out
there by himself, working
on the dam, building it,
standing back with arms
‘proudly crossed to behold
its majesty. Some nights,
the rain would wake him,
and he’d instinctually put

stoutly beaver-tailed engi-

neering, the stream slowed and swelled
on one side of the barrier and trickled
lightly on the bed of colorful rocks and
forest muck on the other. Every week-
end, he’d wake up at the first light of
dawn, come to his children and hesitant-
ly query (and just for reference, he
sounds like a mentally—deficient Dr.
Evil), “You guys warma go build da dam
wit your fadder?” Still, very sleepy, we

“No way, you succubus
bitch. I gotta go to da save dat dam!’.’
And as he rushed out of the bedroom, a
dinner plate would inevitably zip by his
head. Then, all night, he’d ﬁght against
the burgeoning waters, as out a rainy
window we would watch slivers of his
sedulous, deliberate movements under
the sudden ﬂashes of lightning, hoping
for his return. I '

As he gnawed on bark with both

hands, grew out his beard, and invited
over his wild animal friends, he had
become less a husband or a father, but a
Beaver Dad — and so that’s what ‘we
dubbed him. He’d spend almost every
waking hour pouring his love and efforts
into the dam, perfecting it, expanding it.

Then something broke. In the midst
of repulsion cycle ‘No. 2, a hurricane

‘blew a hair’s breadth away from our lit-

tle suburb, ripping open a full-force
tsunami on our street. The creek had
ﬂooded all the way up to its mouth. By
daybreak, the beaver dam was decimat-
ed, hollowed out — a remindful sem-
blance of its visage remained in tattered
shards of rock and dirt. We all came out
to see it. Viewing the carnage, my father
donned the stoic expression of a veteran
soldier seeing his closest friend gunned
down by enemy fire. There was so much
pain expressed in every tinge of his soft,
wrinkled skin, every pouting sigh of
relief and contempt.

It was over. The fever had broken.
We all shufﬂed back into the house
together and began to rebuild it again.

If you forced Death Cab for Cutie and
Mates of State to join" forces to create a
super—group, the result would be a smorgas-
bord of drippy guitars, quirky organ lines,
whiny _chanting and stretched-thin romantic‘

i metaphors about clothing. Itrnight sound

something like The Anniversary, and it def-
initely wouldn’t soundvery good. _
Still, both bands possess a certain
charm, which lies in their respective abilities
to evade the tags given to their contempo-
raries, and to team whatever comball vibes
they undoubtedly emit with a complete con-
ﬁdence. '
_ The members of Death Cab for Cutie
have become masters of  art, spinning

elaborately guitared and sickeningly catchy

- melodies under the conﬁdent lyrics of front

man Ben Gibbard.

On Transatlanticism, an album ﬁlled
with brooding indie—pop sing—a-longs, the
band dabbles in texture more than ever
before, sprinkling in the nylon-string guitar
and the glitchy snares for good measure, and

creates a sound that’s decidedly careful and .

ﬂawlessly produced. «

Though Gibbard gives us an earful ‘

about not having a New Year’s resolution,
ﬁnding pictures of his ex in the glove com-
partment and failing to think of .“something
charming to say,” the music never ceases to
draw us away from his half—baked emotion-
al dissatisfaction. .

Whereas Gibbard and company suck
the musical marrow out of being single,
Mates of State revel in their marital status,
banging on their instruments exuberantly
like newlyweds whose only wedding pre-
sents were a drum set and a keyboard.

In between cuddling for photo shoots,
the PDA—happy Kori Gardner and Jason
Hamrnel chum out delightfully urgent pop
songs littered with high-pitched vocal har-
monies and slapstick drums. It’s clear that, at
the very least, Mates of State are capable of

having way more
. fun than most

making us puke
_ from the constant

married couples,
and they manage
to do so without I

afterglow.

Team Boo,
the band’s latest
release, serves up
more of Gardner
and Harnrnel’s
distinctive sound.
On the opening
track, “Ha I Ha,”
the music stops to
bring forward the
harmonized con-
victions of the band, who sing, “This is the
blood that we’re made 0 ,” only to give way
to spastic, dancy organ twirls and jumpy
drums.

Shrugging off comparisons to Quasi
and the White Stripes hasn’t been hard for

 

»Mates‘ of State, as the lack of divorce-laden

content speaks for itself, as does the distinc-
tiveness_ of their sound
With Transatlanticism and Team Boo,

‘ we see two ambitious bands with big hearts,

unafraid to spill them onto their recordings.
Even if the subject matter gets predictable,
we’re always left tapping our feet when the
songs’ fade. '

Death Cab for Cutie and Mates of State will

play at ‘Club Laga tonight at 7 pm. Tickets
are $12-$14. For more information, call

Building,” according to an Oct. 24 story on MTV.com.
What the hell, Courtney? You
. have had a pretty messed-up life,
and despite everything, here you
are. After Kurt’s tragic suicide in
April 1994, followed by Hole bassist
Kristen Pfaff’s overdose that same
June, you were at rock ‘bottom. Two
people who were very close to" you
were ripped suddenly from your life.
We wondered how much longer you
were going to hold on to’. your own
life. . .
It wasn’t easy, but you picked
up the pieces. Hole’s 1995 perfor-
mance on “MTV Unplugged” was emo-
tional and, I am sure, difficult to do. You
cleaned yourself up and went on to star

year—old Frances Bean Cobain. Frances
Bean has been bounced around from Kurt’s mom,
Wendy O’Connor, back to the home she shares with
Love. Love has been ordered to move out while her
stepfather, Frank Rodriguez, a nanny and an aunt take
care of her. While Love has been permitted frequent
visits,_the detachment has left her darrm near suicidal.
She is reported to have left messages on various

friends’ answering machines saying things like, “I want

were designer gowns. Your hair was sleek and smooth
and there was barely a trace of makeup on your face.
You were mature. You were sophisticated. In 1998,
with Hole, you released Celebrity Skin, a calmer album
that sounded so different from anything that you and
your band had previously done.
You were back and better than ever. The headlines

you were making were all positive. And then we didn’t

hear much about you until you decided that you were
going to record a solo album. Props to you — it’s about
time that the world gets to hear the solo work of Miss
Courtney Love.

« So what happened? Your ﬁve-year relationship
with Barber isn’t worth this crap —- if that was the
impetus for it. You have an angelic daughter who is get-
ting more and more beautiful each year. Despite the
tragic events of her life so far, she’s a seemingly normal
pre-teen. I understand how much it must hurt to not
have her in your custody, but for God’s sake, don’t let
your emotions get the best of you and mess up your
chances of showing the courts what a good mother you,
in fact, are.

She needs you, and you need her. This isn’t the first
time you have had to ﬁght for custody of her. You have
proven to the world that you are capable of overcoming
life’s difﬁculties. Do it again. You are stronger now
than you were in 1994. Believe it or not, you are a bet-

ter person now than you were then.

I’m going to be a bit selfish and say that I am pret-

ty pissed off that, because of what has been going on, _
the release of your solo debut, Americas Sweetheart, ,

has been postponed until February.

I want to hear your new music. I want you to get
your daughter back. And most important to me, the rest
of your fans and your friends and family, I want you to
live. Don’t make the same mistake Kurt did.

Lang has grown in his

time away frommusic

Long Time Coming
Jonny Lang

A & M Records

<£n.“:<.‘r

With a four-year gap between his
sophomore release, Wander This
World, and his ‘newest effort, Long
Time Coming, Jonny Lang has had a
long time to grow musically. The
sophistication of this album reveals
that maturity. . _ i

From the time Lang, now 22, burst
on the music scene six years ago, he
created a buzz with this rough vocals
and way-beyond-his—years guitar
playing. The first time Lang ever
picked up a guitar was at the age 13,
and by 17, he had brought the blues
back to pop culture and received a
Grammy nomination.

Lang effectively displays his ver-
satility on Long Time Coming. He
wrote or co—wrote every song and

. served as a co-producer. With such a
strong hand in the creation of this CD, .

his interest in having his music reﬂect
who he really is is written all over this
effort. He creates an honest, real

sound and feel with every song on this

album.

The title track, “Long Time
Coming,” is a powerful and emotional
boost of bluesy guitar and heart-
wrenching vocals that make it a per-
fect example of Lang’s potential.
“Touch” is a sultry and alluring track
that shows the sensual side to Lang.
He sings, “I come alive with your
touch/Your touch, it always sets me

‘free/No, I can’t get enough/too much

of you is what I need.” The last tfack
on the CD is a live cut, “Livin for the
City,” which proves that his guitar and
vocals are as ﬂawless live as they are
on the album. i

Lang has been critically
acclaimed and a standout since he
began his career at the age of 16. Long

Time Coming lives up to the reputa- -

tion that he has maintained as one of
the few truly goodyoung talents in
music today. This latest effort proves
that Lang isn’t here to fit into an MTV,
pop-craving audience, but instead has
a sound that can ‘withstand the test- of
time.

Wolf,” a wrenching study of what it’s
like to be all alone in the world.

“Love of the Loveless” is unique
in that the singer for the Eels, Mark
Everett — known to his fans simply
as E —— is urging his listeners to get
out there and love people who don’t
have anyone else in their lives. He
reminds us of their plight in lyrics
such as, “All around you people walk-
ing/Empty hearts and voices talk-
ing/Looking for and
finding/Nothing.”

“Fashion Awards” is a biting satir-
ical look at the glitz and gaudiness of

the fashion industry. Everett plays

around with smart—ass lyrics like,
“Let’s go down to the fashion
show/With all the pretty people that
you don’t know/We’ll sit down in the
velvet chairs/They’ll hand out awards
for best hair/And if we don’t win,
well, then/We’l1 blow our heads off in

despair.”
And the rawest song on this
album is undoubtedly “Agony,”

whose harsh guitars combined with
Everett’s raspy voice will strike a
deep chord with even the most stony—
hearted listener.

We get a close look at his anguish
in lyrics: “Cause everyday I’m

here/All I feel is sheer/Agony/Friends
telling me that maybe I need/Some
psychiatric help/Yeah, they’re always
so quick to tell you/Just how to get on
with it/I look into the mirror/And all I
see is age, fear/And agony.”

The Eels are sure to rock hard
Tuesday night. Don’t miss this electri-
fying stage show by one of the music
industry’s most innovative bands.

The Eels will be at Rosebud in the
Strip District this Tues, Oct. 28, at 8
p.m. Tickets are $16. For more infor-
mation, call (412) 323-1919.

Tiger Woods golfs in cyberspace

Tiger Woods PGA Tour
2004 .
Electronic Arts, EA Sports

sfnfrﬂr 1/2

“Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004”
is the latest installment in what is
simply the best golf franchise ever
created. It’s unparalleled in terms of
game play, graphics and innovation,
and it’s impossible to put down.

This game has everything that
could be desired in a golf video
game. It boasts 19 different courses,
including real life, PGA—certified
courses, 15 PGA pros to play as or
against, including John Daly and
Adam Scott, a true 52-week PGA
tour mode and much more.

The single most innovative fea-
ture of “Tiger Woods PGA Tour
2004” is the Gameface mode. The
Gameface mode actually allows
players to create themselves within
the game with unbelievable accura-
cy. Every aspect about a player’s
model can be tweaked, such as hair
color, style and length; facial and
bone structure; skin tone and tex-
ture; body mass in specific areas;
height and weight. The mode is so
versatile that, with less than 20
minutes of tweaking, you can actu-

‘ golf game available. The greens are

ally put yourself in the game. This
aspect adds much to the real feeling
in “Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.”
Graphically, “Tiger Woods PGA
Tour 2004” is the most detailed 3D

beautiful to look at, and the frame
rate never drops below 60 frames
per second. The draw distance is
incredible. The sound is equally
amazing. Oftentimes, I was forced
to turn the volume down to see
whether the helicopter was ﬂying in
the game or outside of my apart-
ment. Feherty and McCord, who
always seem to comment when you
are headed for the bunker, provide
the announcing in the game.

The gameplay is what has set
the “Tiger Woods PGA Tour” fran-
chise apart from the very beginning.
“Tiger Woods PGA Tour” puts you
in complete control. There are no
excuses. If your ball goes into the
rough, it’s because you sent it there.
The control is excellent, as it is
intuitive for beginners and deep
enough to keep true gamers
immersed.

Buy this game. “Tiger Woods
PGA Tour 2004” is not only one of
the best games of the year, but it’s.
also the single best golf game ever
created and is extremely fun to play.

Across the sea: songs for those left behind While their loved ones study abroad

This August, a nice little slice of Pitt’s student body
hopped on airplanes en route to tropical islands, ancient
cities and obscure French towns as part of Study Abroad
programs, heartlessly leaving behind their loved ones.
While students sip on their Chianti, bathe in crystalline
oceans and go wild at foreign nightclubs, fathers, mothers,
siblings, friends and, most importantly for the sake of this
article, signiﬁcant others are left to lament in their absence.

So, in the spirit of what must be quite a large number
of abandoned “spouses” currently bumming around Pitt’s
campus, myself being one of them, here are seven songs
that might provide an apt soundtrack to your sobbing,
lonely bantering and/or neurotic insomnia

Magnetic Fields — “Come back from San Francisco”
Overtop the sedate acoustic guitar pluckings of song-
writer Stephin Merritt, vocalist Claudia Gonson assumes
the character of a wonied girlfriend in New York City call-
ing out for her lover to “Come back from San
Francisco/And kiss me, I’ve quit smoking!” Though deal-
ing with distance within U.S. borders, this song undoubt-
edly characterizes the woes of the unhappily separated, as
Gonson concludes, “Darrin you/I’ve never stayed up as
late as this.”
Likely to induce: all-nighters, self—pity, chain smok-
ing. a

Dismemberment Plan — “The City”

OH of the band’s fantastic Emergency and I album,
this song delves into the idea that one’s love for a place is
directly attached to the people in it. Front man Travis
Morrison sings, “I see why you left/I'here’s no one to
know/Ihere’s nothing to do/The city’s been dead/Since

you’ve been gone,” over.buoyant guitars and jazzy drums.

Likely to induce: Sulking, staring out the window for’ .

extended periods of time, existential anxiety.

Patsy Cline — “You Belong to Me”

Though having been covered by the likes of Bob
Dylan and that guy from Lifehouse, Patsy Cline’s classic
rendition of this tune is supremely charming. Backed by a

full orchestra of Nashville country musicians, Cline sings,’

“See the pyramids along the Nile/Watch the sunrise on a
tropic isle/Just remember darlin’ all the while/You belong
to me.”

Likely to induce: nostalgia, stupid grins, staring at pic-
tures. ,_ .

The Roots — “You Got Me”

Dealing speciﬁcally with a long-distance relationship
between a touring musician and his girlfriend, Black
Thought’s call-and-response duet with Erykah Badu, an
“Ethiopian queen from Philly/taking classes abroad,” is
sure to strike a chord with those detached from their loved
one. Badu sings, ‘‘If you were worried ‘bout where/I been
or who I saw or/What club I went to with my hornies/B aby
don’t worry you know that you got me.”

Likely to induce: Sighs of relief, constant re-listening‘

to make out lyrics.

Cake — “Never There”

A band best known for their ability to dream up deli-
ciously catchy choruses, Cake’s 2000 single found front
man John McCrea putting an unmatched level of energy
into maintaining a relationship. He sings, “On the
phone/Long long distance/Always through such strong

 you say you’re‘too busy/I wonder if you

even miss me,” while the band taps their feet to sliding

‘ ‘and wavering horn lines.

Likely to induce: tearing of pictures, angry phone

messages, dancing!

Everything but the Girl — “Missing”

This dance ﬂoor smash saw British Electro—diva
Tracey Thorn grieving over the loss of what could be any-
thing from a friend or family member to a lover who’s
simply disappeared. Thorn sings, “And I miss you/like the
deserts miss the rain,” overtop oblique synths and thump-
ing beats. a ' .

Likely to induce: more existential anxiety,‘ glow—stick
recreation!

Weezer —- “Across the Sea” .

' At the height of Rivers. Cuomo’s most emotionally
unstable period, documented by Pinkerton, this song
found Weezer’s front man calling out across the Paciﬁc
Ocean to _a 16-year-old Japanese girl with whom he shared
a platonic bond. While distorted guitars soar behind him,
he sings, “Why are you so far away from me?/I need help
and you’re way across the sea,” but ﬁnds solace in kI1ow-
ing that he has her “letters” and she has his “songs.” I

Likely to induce; staring at the ceiling, thepurchase of
black-rimmed glasses and black hair dye.

OK, so maybe four months apart isn’t going to kill a
relationship. Absence, if you’ll pardon the cliche, might
make the heart grow fonder, but it may also make it con-
fused, anxious, paranoid, or plain lonesome in the mean-
time. So, it’s nice to have the music to fall back on.

remain

perfect iinBig East

RAYMOND NEWBY
Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team swept both of

its matches this weekend, remaining
undefeated in Big East conference play
and extendingits winning streak to 12

matches. The Panthers (18-3, 7-0) have

won .10 consecutive Big East matches dat-
ing back to last season and have swept
their opponents in four straight matches.
On Friday night, the Panthers defeat-
ed the Seton Hall Pirates (16-10, 0-7)
three games to none, and continued their

_ winning ways on Sunday afternoon with a

straight-game victory over the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights (9,—14, 3-4) for their 16th
victory in 17 matches.

Pitt 3 Seton Hall 0
Pitt began their match against Seton
Hall. with a 30-23 victory. Tied at 18 part-

"Way through the game, the Panthers

seemed to take over at the end, scoring six
straight and 12 of the last 17 points.

The second game proved to be much
more of a test. The Panthers jumped out
to an early 6-2 lead, but the Pirates fought
back to knot-‘the game at 10. The rest of
the game was back and forth, with the two
teams tying each other 15 more times

before the Panthers were able to score
three straight points to win 30-27.

Pitt was in control of the third game
for most of the way, gaining as much as a
nine point advantage, but had to with-
stand a late charge by Seton Hall before it

i could win the game 30-26.

“We were pretty rusty against Seton
Hall,” said coach Chris Beerman. “We
had a 10-day layoff from playing. I think

we just had .a few more hitting errors than-

we usually do'[’and our] timing was a lit-
tle bit off. [It was a] pretty good win — I

wasn’t too disappointed. I just thought the

rustiness showed up.”

Outside hitter Wendy Hatlestad led
the Panthers’ attack with a match-high 14
kills and 10 digs. Middle hitter Megan

Miller added 12 kills and a match-high

five blocks.

Middle hitter April Puzauskas chipped
in with nine kills, three blocks and a
‘match-high .533 hitting percentage.
Outside hitter Sarah Rollman posted nine
kills, 11 digs and three blocks. , .

Setter Lindsey Macke, who was
named Big East co-Player of the Week,

‘had 41 assists, eight digs and a career-

best three blocks for the Panthers. She

Defense steps upin victory over theOrangemen

' JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

After falling out of the polls with
two non-conference losses early in the
season, the Pitt football team was‘ left
with two options: regroup during con-
ference play and make a 11111 at a major
bowl or risk having a very disappoint-

A ing and potentially damaging season.

»While huge games remain on the
schedule, the Panthers’ 34-14 win over

Syracuse on Saturday showcased what"

Pitt can do when it puts together two
solid halves of football.

Head coach Walt Harris, speaking
at his weekly press conference on
Monday, left no doubt that he was quite
pleased with his team’s effort.

“It was a really good win for us,”
Harris said". “Right now, with the way

college football is going, any win is a
really good win._”

Perhaps the most encouraging sign
for the Panthers on Saturday was the
defense’s ability to shut down the
Orangemen. Pitt held Syracuse quarter-

back R.J. Anderson to just 49 yards’ ‘

passing and intercepted him twice.
Anderson had not thrown a pick all sea-
son. -
_ The Panthers also played much bet-
ter up front. Anderson was only sacked
once but was under heavy pressure for
much of the game. Syracuse running
back Walter Reyes did run for 97 yards,
but Pitt did not allow him to break big
runs that could turn the momentum of
the game, a problem the Panthers have’
had this season. Overall, the
Orangemen were held to just 195 total
yards.

“[That was] by far the best we’ve
played this year on defense,” Harris
said. Harris singled out the secondary
for their work, saying that senior cor-
nerback Shawntae Spencer ‘had one of
the best games of ‘his career.

On offense, quarterback Rod
Rutherford continued his stellar play by

throwing for 310 yards and three touch- A

downs. Six different receivers caught
passes from Rutherford, who seemed to
be doing a much better job of hitting his
second and third options.

“A lot of people here did not
believe Rod could play quarterback,”
Harris said. “[Former Pitt quarterback]
David Priestley was an outstanding
quarterback. I think Rod felt like he did-
n’t have a chance, [but] something hap-
pened to him that summer [before his
junior season].” «

Another bright spot on offense for
the Panthers was the play of running
back Tim Murphy. Murphy carried the
ball nine times for 21 yards but made a
couple of tough runs when Pitt needed
them.

“[Murphy] is a change of pace, a
different kind of runner,” Harris said.
“It looks like he plays fasterjthan J awan
[Walker]- He showed great guts and
determination.” .

, Murphy is listed as a co-starter this
week, along with Walker, and he may

continue to see significant playing time

until Brandon Miree returns.

Pitt will travel to Boston College
this week to take on an Eagles team that
the Panthers haven’t beaten on the road

since 1989. The last time Pitt played at 1

Alumni Stadium, in 2001, Boston
College routed the Panthers 45-7.

Tuesday, October 28,3f)03

Unusual occurrences in the ‘Burgh and Bronx Saturday

Something unexpected happened at both Heinz Field and Yankee Stadium on

Saturday.

Pitt’s defense turned in a stout performance against a Syracuse team that put
up 39 points the week before against Boston College, and the hated
(well, at least I hate them) New York Yankees were unable to force
a pivotal game seven of the World Series.

Let’s look at the most important of Saturday’s happenings. The
Panthers’ defense was able to hold Syracuse to under 200 yards of
total offense. Is this the same defense that has been frustrating
Panther fans all season?

Yes, it’s the same one. The defense gave up 146 yards on the
ground with 97 of those rushing yards coming from Orangemen
running back Walter Reyes.

The key factor to the defense’s big performance was that it was
able to completely shut down the other facet of Syracuse’s game —— the passing
game.

Orangemen quarterback R.J. Anderson was held to 49 yards passing as he
completed only seven of 18 passes. And Pitt managed to force Anderson to throw
his first two interceptions of the season.

When you are able to shut down one portion of a team’s game plan it makes
it a lot simpler to play defense. Even though Reyes and Anderson ran with ease
during the first half, at some point, Syracuse had to come up with some plays
from its passing game.

Unable to do that, the Orangemen had to rely on a one—dimensional attack.
This aided the Panthers in holding Syracuse to one offensive touchdown —-
Syracuse’s first touchdown was scored when Syracuse’s Steve Gregory blocked
Andy Lee’s punt.

Maybe our young, inexperienced defense has finally grown up. Or the sec-
ondary, one of the more experienced areas of our defense, decided that it was
time to step up and take over. Whatever happened out there on Saturday, don’t
let it be a stranger. A smothering defense, along with Larry Fitzgerald, Rod
Rutherford and the offense, could be a lethal weapon.

If you would have told me at the beginning of Spring Training that the
Florida Marlins would be the 2003 World Series champions, I probably would
have laughed in your face. But somehow they ended up sending the Bronx

  

Bombers home for the winter, crying. Well, actually, only Alfonso Soriano cried

that I know of, but you get the picture.
Florida was the underdog during the entire postseason, yet somehow beat
three teams that it was not supposed to. When the Marlins got past

‘ V‘  the San Francisco Giants, it appeared that the Giants were the vic-

’ tims of being burned out.

Then the Marlins, not Steve Bartman, battled back against the
Chicago Cubs’ top two pitchers and won games six and seven at
Wrigley Field to win the National League Championship. ‘

Okay, ﬁne, the Yankees, will win their 27th World Series Title.
I’m sure that is what-most of America was thinking at the start of
the World Series. But Florida showed resiliency and a lot of heart.
The Marlins were not intimidated by the Yankees or Yankee
A Stadium and went in and beat Andy Pettitte, a pitcher who in his
career has been clutch in the postseason and also managed to shut down New
York’s power-packed offense.

The key things are the heart and desire, along with resiliency, that the .

Marlins showed. Pitt could take a chapter from the Marlins’ book, as they will
be underdogs in two upcoming games in November against Virginia Tech and
Miami. Pitt needs to continue to dd the unexpected because, while a national title
appears to be a long shot, the Big East title isn’t.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports editor for The Pitt News and is glad that Pitt’s’
coaching staﬁ‘ ﬁnally ﬁgured out that it needed to utilize tight end Kris Wilson
in the passing game.

Pitt’s lack of offense conti

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The men’s soccer team suffered
its fifth shutout of the year against
Ohio State at Founders Field on
Friday without two key offensive
players — their leading scorer, for-
ward Keeyan Young, and midfielder
Tyler Bastianelli — who together
account for eight of the Panthers’ 19
goals this season.

Despite missing those two play-
ers, the Panthers (5-10-1 Overall, 2-

5-1 Big East) played strong and
came up with several scoring
chances. ~

In the first half, Panther forward
Billy Brush had an open look at the
Buckeyes’ net, and fired a shot that
ﬂew just above the crossbar. "

Marco Carrizales created a great
scoring opportunity when he put the
ball in play on a corner kick to Pitt
defender Clay Haflich. Haflich took
the ball off the corner kick and got it
to midfielder Jacob Kring, who fired
the ball in on net. Buckeyes’ goal-

., ..—,,

nues in

keeper Raymond Burse, Jr. dove to
make the save. .

Just minutes after that, midfield-
er Zamahir Campos positioned him-
self all alone about five yards in
front of the goal, and midfielder
Bryan Headrick crossed the ball to

him. Campos controlled the pass and

got too much under his shot, causing
the ball to ﬂy high over the crossbar.

“[Ohio State] had a good chance
and scored. We had a couple of good
chances and didn’t. It’s been the
story of the season,” coach Joe

RACHAEL COUP/CONTRIBUTING EDITOR-

Pitt midﬁelder Tyler Bastianelli,’ seen in action in a game earlier this season, and forward Keeyan Young missed Sunday’s game,
in which the Panthers were shut out 1-0. Bastianelli and Young have accounted for eight of Pitt’s 19 ‘goals on the season.

1-0 loss to Buckeyes

Luxbacher said.
The first half ended with no
goals being scored by.-ei,ther.side.
Ohio State (4-9-3) had a ‘quality
‘scoring chance when midfielder
Taylor Korpieski controlled the ball

and used the back of his “foot to

move the ball behind him to Sammy
Tamporello. Tamporello took the
pass and quickly moved~_;,the ball
back to Korpieski, who wasted no
time firing the ball in on Lowery.
Lowery dove to make one of his five
saves on the day. S

The lone goal of the game came
right after a Panther scoring chance.

Haﬂich tapped the ball to mid-
fielder Brian Madden, who shot the
ball into the hands of a diving Burse.

Ohio State countered and took
the ball downfield quickly.
Buckeyes’ defender Dana York
crossed the ball to Tamporello, who
shot it past Lowery for his first goal
of the season. .

The goal came at 55:25, with
midfielder Rob Strachan and York
recording assists on the play.

Pitt midfielder Jeffrey Tidd gen-
erated a few chances to help his team
tie the game. On one play, a team-
mate kicked the ball toward the goal
and Tidd slashed in, deflecting the
ball just right of the net with his
head. a

With about nine minutes lef
Tidd crossed the ball to Brush who

fired a shot on goal that Burse

stopped with a diving save.

The game ended with Ohio State
outshooting Pitt 13-ll. Burse
recorded four saves and hissecond
shutout win of_ the season.

The Panthers ‘have two games
left on the schedule, and both are
against Big East teams.

“[We have] two difficult games,
but if we win two games, there isa
very good chance we make the [Big
East] tournament,-” Luxbacher said.

The Panthers next game is at
Virginia Tech on Wednesday. Their
final home game will be Sunday at 1
p.m. against Syracuse.
