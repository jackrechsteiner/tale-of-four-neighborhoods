“Don’t pick on Cumpie’s!”
This was owner Jon Genaro’s
response to the police’s second raid
of his bar within one month.
Genaro feels that his business is
receiving an unfair amount of criti-
cism from police and the communi-
ty because he is “the new “guy on
the block,” and‘because other bars
' want his business. ‘
“Ifr they raid ‘Cumpie’s, why
don’t they raid the dorms?” Genaro
asked. * .
Commander Tim Delaney of the
Pitt police responded by_ saying that
bar owners are prone to finger-
pointing when their bars are raided
and cited for» violations.‘ He- said
that they usually blame other bar
owners for accusing them of viola-
tions because of the competition
involved in the business.
On Saturday, April 29,» police
raided Cumpie’s Bar shortly after
midnight and found ,that- almost
' two-thirds of the bar’s patrons were
under the age of 21.

Pitt settles with

former football player-

DAVID TURNER

Managing Editor,

A former Pitt football player has
settled the suit he raised with the
University in 1997, which stemmed
from an injury that left him paralyzed.‘

The trouble is, no one knows for
sure how much the settlement is for.

Lawyers for Demale Stanley, the
23-year-old who broke his neck after
crashing into a wall in the Cost Center
during an indoor practice in March,
1996, claim that.Pi,tt will pay $31 mil-
lion in recompense for what Stanley
charges was “negligence” on the part

of the University and its staff.

University- spokesman Ken Service
in a May 2 release said, “The case res-
olution is less than one—sixth of the
amount wrongly publicized by Willie
Gary,‘ Demale Stanley’s attorney.”

Service did report through the
same release, however, that the
University will continue to fund all of
Demale’s medical expenses. Such

expenses are covered by a University-
paid NCAA catastrophic injury policy
that is provided to all varsity athletes at
Pitt.

The UniVersity’s statement further
claimed that Gary violated “the clear
terms of the conﬁdentiality of the set-
tlement and [asserted] improperly that
the University and its staff were negli-
gent.”

The football staff, including former
coach Johnny Majors, were implicated
in the lawsuit. 1 ‘ .

‘ The injury occurred March 23,
1996 when spring practices‘ were
moved indoors because of cold weath-
er conditions. Stanley, then a promising
19-year-old wide-receiver, crashed
headﬁrst into a padded wall While run-
ning a pattern toward the sideline.

Majors, now an assistant to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and
Head Coach Walt Harris, retired after
the 1996 season.

Service said that the University
was proud to reach “an amicable reso-
lution” to the suit.

THE P111 News 3

Pitt student named

“Rising star of justice”  

ERIN LINDEMAN
Staff Writer

On the heels of two local racial-

’ ly-motivated shooting sprees, mem-

bers of Pittsburgh’s peace—promoting
Thomas Merton Center gathered
Monday evening to celebrate some of
Pittsburgh’s most prominent fighters
for justice. Among those honored was
Pitt senior John Lacny, president of
Students in Solidarity.

Lacny was chosen as the rising
Star of Justice by the, center, which
offers Pittsburghers with diverse
philosophies and faiths a» common
ground in a non—violent struggle to
{bring about what it deems a more just
and peaceful work community. The
center is a grass roots‘ organization,

and 80 percent of its budget stems .

from membership and sponsored
events.
The 18 members of the center’s

 board selected Lacny and other recip-

ients from 126 nominations provided

a by members of the ‘Merton Center.

The awards were given to those
whose work has promoted peace and
justice in the Pittsburgh community.

' Lacny was selected largely due to
his work with Students in Solidarity,
specifically regarding the Living
Wage -Campaign. Lacny helped to

. form the social justice group during

hisfreshman year to focus on local
and national labor issues.

Those working on the campaign
are trying to get a‘ county ordinance
passed, requiring employers who
receive money from the county to
pay their workers at least $9.12 per
hour in addition to health care bene-
fits. L "

This ‘figure was determined dur-
ing a study performed by Ralph
Bangs at the University Center for
Social and Urban Research.

Lacny and fellow honoree Linda

»Wambaugh worked closely on the

Living Wage Campaignto reach four

' goals: public awareness of the issue

through popular economics work-
shops; support of the rights of work-
ers trying to preserve existing living
wage jobs; buildi_ng a movement of
both the employed and unemployed

through union, religiousjnstitutions ‘

and community organizations; and
the establishment of living wage leg-
islation covering employees receiv-
ing public subsidies and contracts in
Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and
across Western Pennsylvania.

Anne Feeney, a well-known
activist and folk singer, entertained
the crowd with her songs about
“true” activism. She was accompa-
nied by Cross'Current, a band whose
harmony and upbeat satire gave voice
to the peace and justice community.

Feeney began the evening with a
song she wrote, titled, “Have You
Beento Jail for Justice?” which gave
a time line of important activist
events in history, as well as sugges-
tions on methods of protest.

Pittsburgh Post—Gazette colum-"

nist Tony Norman, who also gave
opening remarks, presented the win-
ners of the New’ People Star of
Justice awards. ’

After receiving the award, Lacny
thanked those present for choosing
him.

“I feel incredibly honored,” he
said.

Maryellen Hayden, the center’s
coordinator, said Lacny was an
incredible and caring human being.

“He [and "Students in Solidarity

were] able to get over 100 people in’

to see my M film, “Global Village,
Global Pillage,” about the World
Trade Organization and sweatshops,”
Hayden said. “He is just a wonderful
person.”

” He also said that Cumpie’s had

/been mentioned at an Alcohol

Advisory meeting as a.bar that was

the age of 21.

University administrators, student
representatives and the Pitt police.
It addresses,-problems and creates

ing. . ' '

Genaro said he has no idea wh
someone complained. '

“I, respect every person that

“I treat them right.” A

The first raid of Cumpie’s Bar

‘occurred on April 7, during which
13 people were cited. Genaro said’
he received no fines or notices after _

the first raid and still doesn’t know
if anything will happen to his bar.

_ He said the police didn’t make
him sign anything and failed to

“We card everybody,” he said-

Lastpmonth Genaro purchased a
machine that swipes IDs and veri-

He said he has used it consis-
tently since then, but says that not
even the machine can spot every
fake ID. He added that the night of

.the second raid seven underage
drinkers avoided arrests with their

fake IDs. .
“Even the cops couldn’t tell the

difference,” Genaro said.

In addition to asfine of up to

FAKES

opposite sex, while the law prevents
you and others your age from joining in
on the fun.

It is being left at home, having
nothing else constructive to do, or per-
haps the sheer desire for a- strong drink
that prompts many underage drinkers to
devise some sort of fake identification
that will get them through the door of
bars and clubs.

The law prevents minors from
entering bars and clubs when not in the
presence of a parent or guardian.

The construction of fake IDs is his-
torically a major operation across the
country. The list of methods for design-
ing and creating them is a lengthy one.

Underagers have been known to

FROM PAGE 1

-. use the IDs of friends or siblings with

similar appearances who have already
turned 21 to gain access to alcohol. IDs
from different states or countries are
often used to mislead bouncers and bar-
tenders who may not be familiar with
foreign IDs.

Underagers, with computer know-
how have been known to scan their dri-
ver’s license onto their computer,

change the date on the screen, then print _

out a new license on a color printer and

-laminate it.

An obvious concern held by parents
and police alike is that students spend
so much time and creativity on the fake
IDs that they’ll neglect their school
work. _ I . _

But there are severe penalties for
getting caught with an ID that displays
a falsified birth date. '

Pennsylvania state law dictates that

the first time an individual is caught

with false identification, he or she is
guilty of a summary offense which
includes a $300 fine with the possibili-
ty of serving a 90-day jail sentence.

A second offense becomes a misde-
meanor of the third degree and man-
dates a fine of no more than $500. The
final amount of the fine and whether or
not jail time is to be served is decided
by the district magistrate in the area
where the offender was caught.

 .When alcohol is involved with the
use of the fake ID, underage drinking
laws are enforced, as well as the pun-

ishments associated with using false

identiﬁcation.-
This includes a 90-day suspension

of driving privileges and a fine of $300.
A second offense brings a fine of no
more than $500 and suspension of dri-
ving privileges for one year.

But it is becoming increasingly
more difficult for underage drinkers to
get into bars and to purchase liquor ille-
gally.

State liquor stores are now
equipped with scanners that read per-
sonal identification cards. Employees
of the store are required to scan the IDs
of anyone attempting to purchase alco-
hol who appears to be under the age of
30. '

By scanning the ID, liquor stores
are able to obtain the ID number, per-
sonal description and address of the
person purchasing alcohol.

The advent of these scanners has,

reportedly made underage traffic in
liquor stores nonexistent.

Sending friends who are 21 into
liquor stores to purchase alcohol is also
a prevalent method of obtaining alcohol
that police are cracking down on.

State, city and Pitt police are strate-
gically placing undercover officers
around the entrances of state liquor
stores to observe the behavior of the
people going in and out of the store,
according’ to Ed Ferchak, the acting
assistant supervisor of the Pennsylvania
State Police Bureau of Liquor Control
and Enforcement. .

“It’s based on what happens prior to
and after the purchase that draws suspi-
cion,” he said. “But it’s basically being
in the right place at the right time, for
the undercover officers.”

Some bars around Pittsburgh are
also beginning to use scanners similar
to the ones found in liquor stores.

These models are hand-held
devices that ‘are intended for bouncers
to use as patrons enter the bar.

Cumpie’s on Atwood Street is one
of the first bars in the area to publicize
that it has purchased a scanner and is
preparing touse it on patrons entering
the bar. - A ' _

- With underage drinking at bars
becoming more of a problem for own-

ers, these scanners would ‘prevent .prob— -

lems surrounding fake‘ IDs and under-
age drinking. . .
According to Ferchak, scanners.
will only become a standard in bars if
they are marketed correctly by their
manufacturers. ‘ '5

headquarters in Austin, Texas, told us that
press check—in would be held at 5 p.m. at
the AV Center, which is a hangar for pri-
vate planes on the back side of Pittsburgh
International Airport.

We arrived and parked amid the local
television satellite trucks that were raising
their antennae to prepare for a live broad-
cast duringmthe 6 o’clock news.

As we walked into the lobby of the
AV Center, there was a short line at the
desk, and to the left, a group of couches
with several well-dressed people who all
appeared to be very bored.

I got my press pass and we made our
way to the couches to join the bored peo

no unusual obtrusions in our pockets or
under our clothes.

Making our way onto the airport tar-
mac, the wind whipped at our clothes and
hair, making it almosta struggle to reach
the barrier that was set up to_ keep the press
at a safe distance from the presidential
hopeful.

It was 5:40 now and we weren’t
expecting Bush’s plane to land until after
6:30. It was at this point when the bore-
dom of reporting from the campaign trail
became apparent to me.

As excited as we were to have out
first encounter with big—time politics, it
was impossible to disregard the boredom
of waiting for a man on a plane, who
might not even have anything to say to -us.

An aide then told us that Bush would
be arriving in a purple and white 727 air-

ple, who turned out to be the other e ,

journalists who were waiting for Gov.
Bush’s arrival.

This was my first introduction to
the national political press corps.

We, the news editor,iphoto editor
and myself, sat down with the other
reporters and began waiting. I could
tell that the professional journalists
around me were not overly excited to
be there and were not willing to share
their insight about what might happen
at the meeting of Bush and Sen. John

By this time it was approaching
5:30. Secret Service men hustled in
and out of the door leading to the run-
way and Bush’s aides, who had come ‘
to Pittsburgh before their boss, worked
to register the remaining journalists. ' '

Finally, a large Secret Serviceman
motioned for us to hit the runway. On
our way out the door, they peered -into
the bags we had with us, and gave us a
quick sight check to make sure we had

We pushed through a crush of network "

television cameramen who had set up in
front of the large brass revolving doors of

, the Westin William Penn Hotel Downtown.

NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox News and
CNN had set up their crews on the velvet
rug outside of the luxury hotel, waiting for
a glimpse of Sen. John McCain, R—Ariz.,
the former prisoner of war who had sched-
uled a visit to Pittsburgh to sign copies of
his new book at Ross Park Mall.

Two dozen stairs below the main ﬂoor,
the ballroom and its equally grand lobby
were ﬁlled to capacity with journalists,
Bush campaign workers ‘ ‘ ’ ’ ' ‘
and members of the
Secret Service.

We got in line, offi-
cial Pitt News credentials
in hand, and waited to be
checked in, a process
required of each member
of the invited press, with
the exception of those
who travel continuously
with the governor.

At a long white

letter of identiﬁcation and
school IDs to one of the at ,
staffers. She read over them carefully and
eventually awarded» us with a fuchsia press
pass, made of oak-tag, emblazoned with
the word “Media.” She had hand-written in
our names, the date and our media affilia-
tion. I fastened mine to my Pitt lanyard and
slipped it over my head.

We walked, into the ballroom, which

_ was set with 70 red chairs in front of a

makeshift stage with  American
and Pennsylvania Commonwealth ﬂags
stood behind the podium, on top of it sat

several heavy microphones. Behind» the“

seats was a low platform set with lamps and
boom microphones ‘which reached almost

     
 

to the ceiling. Cameras were set at atten-
tion, waiting for the two men to enter.
Men and women from newspapers,
magazines and television stations across
the country circulated, carrying bags from
Bruegger’s Bagels, cups of coffee, briefcas-

es. No one was without either a copy of the -
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or the New York 9

Times. ,

At 8:05 a.m., the Secret Security ﬁled
inside and instructed us all to leave. It was
time for the “sweep,” during which they
were to ensure that the room was safe.

Outside, Bush campaign workers
walked briskly back and forth, talking into
staticky walkie-talkies, as men from the
Secret Service adjusted their spiral-wire
earpieces and led German Shepherd dogs

Many reporters took this
time to relax. Two camera-
men laid on their backs on
the thick periwinkle rug
underfoot.

A woman in a gray suit
walked by and mentioned
to her companion, who was
a staffer with Bush’s cam-
paign, “All these news peo-

"ple are making me ner-
vous.” _

She laughed and contin-
ued past. .

 About 20 minutes later,
the press began lining up to be checked and
let back inside of the ballroom. Policemen

"inspected cellular telephones and bags,

while Secret Servicemen used hand-held
metal detectors. _ » V _ _
Several reporters made jokes about the
herd-like style in which we were being
admitted to the ballroom.

went on to read the list of Pennsylvania
Republican Party dignitaries who would
be on the runway to greet Bush as he got
off the plane.

Someone. then asked what time Bush
had left New York, where he had spent the
morning attending the funeral of Cardinal
John O’Connor. The aide told us that he
had left New York at 5:00 and was expect-
ed to land in Pittsburgh around 6245.

At 6:05 someone spotted Bush’s
plane approaching the landing strip.
Quickly the local news stations contacted
their newsrooms to prepare for a live feed
directly for the 6 o’clock news broadcasts.

An air of excitement swirled around
us as Bush’s plane pulled up and a truck
with stairs mounted on the back of it drove
out to meet the opening door of the plane.

few comments.

As he approached the line of press, it
seemed like all the reporters began shout-
ing questions at him at once. Bush seem-
ingly put his foot down to this, quieted the
interrogators and began to speak.

“I was very fortunate to be able to cel-
ebrate the life of Cardinal O’Connor this
afternoon in New York,” he said.

Shortly after Bush began to speak; my

pnote—taking began to taper off and I can

only assume that I became caught up in
the moment. , ’

I was standing face—to—face with a
man of considerable legacy and power for
the ﬁrst time in my life, and I was, for a
short period of time, part of a group of
journalists who were there to experience
the happenings of the presidential carn-
paign and report their findings back to the
country. '

Bush was visibly relaxed, laughing.

In the brief, half hour press conference,
the men highlighted their similarities,

stressing the success of their meeting and _

their burial of the resentment that had
grown between them during the primary
race. '
“We had a very good meeting,”
McCain said. .

endorsement of Bush, describing it as his

repeated “I endorse Governor Bush, I

before Bush responded, “By the way, I

they were sharing an inside joke, but were

instead laughing at what would lead every ‘

EDITORIAL
Bob Knight is no longer suited

to coach Indiana basketball

Indiana University basketball

coach Bob Knight was in big
trouble. In a 1997 videotape,
Knight is seen grabbing player
Neil Reed by the neck, possib1y_
choking him. He’d reportedly

shrieked obscenities at media

people, thrown chairs into the

court, and — according to an arti-

cle in the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
—— “accidentally headbutted play-
er Sharon Wilkerson during a
timeout at Michigan State.”

After a seven-week investi-

gation, Knight was ﬁned $30,000

and was suspended for three
games. Once the issue was set-

tled, school president Myles
Brand initiated what he called‘ a

“zero-tolerance policy.” Let’s

hope president Brand can count.

This type of rampant, ongo-

ingviolence warrants a pink slip.
At best, Knight ‘should have

expected early retirement. But
the ﬁne is a paltry sum, barely a
scratch on his ATM card. And
suspension will only delay the

I inevitable outburst. The man has.

overstepped his limits for 29
years now, and if he weren’t so
successful, Knight would at this
moment be scanning the classi-
fieds.

Knight has a lot to brag
about: He won three national col-

lege championships and coached
a gold—winning team in the 1984
Olympics. But neither this record
nor the intensity of the game
should justify his actions. It’s
high time someone called him for
it. '

Reed should have pressed
charges three years ago when the
evidence was in. Clutching a
throat is grounds for assault.
Now that so much time has
passed, Reed’s_ case wouldbe
weaker, but it’s worth pursuing.
Knight didn’t even apologizeto
the individuals, deciding instead
to make a general announcement
claiming that he’s willing to
change. But is it sincere? More
importantly, will his newfound
humility last?

And frankly, rules are rules.
Brand is granting Knight a sort of
provisional immunity. Put sim-
ply: We’re laying down the law.
Zero tolerance" from here on out.
But we like you, so just don ’t do it
again, OK? , i

This issue should strike a
chord with Pitt athletics. Tempers
ﬂare in almost every game, but
it’s the coach who must cement
the team’s integrity. Should suc-
cess and‘ popularity override
University policy? Let’s hope it
doesn’t come to that.

“Relish

V Freshman orientation is not the most exciting
thing you will ever experience. Last year people
seemed to take it too seriously or not seriously
enough. They were either stressing out about
whether they could pass their placement exams
and take the classes they wanted, or they just went
out and partied and missed a few of the exams
they were supposed to take. That was really just
one guy, my next-door neighbor, who I think
came to college for the  do not
become one of these people; the beer atcollege
isn’t really that great, and paying thousands of
dollars for the privilege of drinking it seems a bit
much ‘

So just relax, sit back, and enjoy the tide of
ﬁeshman orientation. It can be a really fun time to
get to know the people who will
become your friends for eight months
or longer. It is a chance to just walk up
to new people, talk to them and ﬁnd a
connection. 7 ‘

When you’re sitting in a huge
auditorium, waiting for a lecturer to ﬁnish or tak-

ing an Englishtcomposition test, look around at ‘

the sea of faces surrounding you. See the two
guys sitting in the back making jokes? They’re
probably cool. See that girl who got here 15 min-
utes before you did and has her regular and spare
pencils out on her desk? She’ll be your study patt-

ner, if you’re lucky. See your best friend in the _

whole world? N 0, he or she is probably not going
to be there. There are people in the auditorium
who you will notice and never talk to again.
There are also people who seem to have nothing
in common with you. These are the people you
will eventually call up at 3 am. just to gripe about
your day. -

Speaking of 3 am calls, for me they usually
"involved a cigarette. As you will soon ﬁnd out (if
you haven’t already), college is a huge culture of

- smokers. Meeting people in the Towers ashtray
was one of the best parts of my -‘freshman year.
However, I recommend that you save the money
for books and try not to succumb to nicotine
addiction.

the universal nightmare come true. I realized that
there was nothing I could do about it, and I sur-

I remember the countless times. I could just

to get ice cream and ﬁgured out what classes I

Rep. Barr brews toil and trouble

May 18 marks the
anniversary of a holy war.
I’m not talking about the
conflict between Catholic
and Protestant extremists in

_ Northern Ireland, or about

the strife between Jewish and
Muslim militants in the
Middle East. I refer to a
“holy war” on American soil:

U.S. Rep. Bob Barr’s assault.

against Wiccansin the U.S.
Army.

Practitioners of Wicca, or
witchcraft, adhere_ to a
nature-based theology which
can be traced to pre-
Christian Europe. And like
those of other faiths,
Wiccans are welcome to
serve in the U.S. military. In

fact, the -military actively '0

supports the practices of
such individuals.

This policy of religious
tolerance, however, roused
the ire of Georgia
Republican Barr. In a press

0‘ release dated May 18, 1999,

the congressman announced
a virtual jihad against those
Wiccans who are honorably
serving in the U.S. armed
forces. According to that

I declared that sup-

press release (which is avail-
able on Barr’s official Web
site, www.house.gov/barr),

‘Barr demanded “an end to

the taxpayer-supported prac-
tice of witchcraft on military
bases.” V

In a letter to congression-
al and military leaders, Barr

 

transparent appeal to reli-
gious prejudice. The military
policy is very clear: As long
as military personnel prac-
tice their faiths within the
confines of military regula-
tions, they are welcome to
adopt any theological label
that suits them. Moreover,
the military chap-

porting Wiccan MICHAEL laincy has a poli-

dangerous prece— MAZZA religious needs of
dent that could COLUMNIST all personnel —
easily result in all - including those
sorts of bizarre practices who practice minority reli-

being supported by the mili-
tary under the rubric of ‘reli-
gion.”’

As an. Army reservist
with more than a decade of
service behind me, I have
followed the course of Barr’s
holy war with great interest.
And I am happy to report,

one year after Barr’s unpro- A

voked assault, that religious
tolerance still reigns’ in the
Army. Barr’s “war” has been
a failure. _

And it’s easy to under-
stand why both Congress and
the military establishment

gions.

In his attack on Wicca,
Barr failed to recognize the
fact that there is great diver-
sity within every religious

tradition. Yes, there are
Wiccans whose personal
practices and theological

interpretations make them
unsuited to military service.
But there are similarly
unsuited individuals within
the Christian and Jewish
communities, as well as
within other traditions.
Christians who interpret
the Gospel as having a mes-

example, could not
expected to kill or wound
enemy troops in combat. But
such individuals represent
only one strand of
Christianity. Just as it is
wrong to stereotype all
Christians based on t_he
beliefs of Christian pacifists,
so too is it wrong to stereo-
type the adherents of any
religion. Fortunately, mili-
tary Wiccans who have faced
such prejudice have a sup.-

‘port system not only in the

military itself, but also in
such private organizations as
the Military Pagan Network
(www.milpagan.org) '

I have, over the years,
been privileged to have
served with military person-
nel of all religious (and non-

religious) tpersuasions:
Jewish, Muslim, Roman
Catholic, Pagan, atheist,

Pentecostal ,Christian and
others. This diversity should
be celebrated, not feared.

I was thinking of Barr’s
“holy war” last winter, when

,I was designing the program

for my Army Reserve unit’s'
annual holiday party.

for Wicca

Mindful‘ of the military’s
proud tradition of religious
pluralism, I included a multi-
faith information supplement
on the last page of the pro-
gram. That supplement listed
the various holidays that
were being celebrated by

‘members of the Army family

that winter.
I included Christmas,

A Hanukkah, the Muslim holy

month of Ramadan and other
observances. And yes, I
included the Wiccan holiday
known as Yule.

You see, I’m proud to be
part of an Army that respects
the religious beliefs of each
soldier. I’m proud. to be part
of an Army that judges sol-

diers on their professional-

ism and integrity, and does
not allow religious bigotry to
poison our esprit de corps.
This is the Army that I
love. ‘And I respectfully
invite Barr to end this divi-

sive holy war, and to join us 0

in a" fellowship that tran-
scends religious boundaries.

Examining third party options may save country

I wonder what exactly our two
big-name" parties stand for nowa-
days. They have copied off each
other so much in their vying for the
middle ground and for corporate
donations that they often resemble

one another. Radio commentator
. and author Jim Hightower suggests

that what we need in this country-
isn’t a third party, but —a second one.

Eachparty has made enough
changes to deviate from its older
paths. The Republicans stand for the

wealthy and corporations and also

for a limited moral cause. The
Democrats once stood for Workers
and consumers, but in recent years
Bill Clinton and Al Gore have
pushed numerous pro—corporation
policies, backing the WTO and
NAFTA, reducing antitrust. and
environmentalist suits and increas-
ing the amount of corporate welfare.
They still talk the right talk, but
their actions speak louder — and
they act on the side of those with the
dough. Few people truly concerned
about-the middle- or lower—c1ass or
poor will buy it, which is why more
voters are willing to support a _Pat
Buchanan or _Ralph Nader in the
main election." ’ ‘ L .
The Republicans have aban-

doned their heritage by abandoning

' some,‘ of the social conservatism

they did possess. The party, under
the likes of Tom Ridge, has become
increasingly opposed to the life of
humans in the mother’s
(“pro-choice,” as they term it).
Many Republicans push the causes
of gamblers (to the disappointment
of moral Republicans, like
Frank Wolf) or corporate
admen seeking to brain?
wash kids into their line
of thought. With people
like Newt Gingrich, Bob
Packwood, David Duke and Helen
Chenoweth’ aboard the -ship, the
moral anchors have vanished. I

As the.Democrats ditch family.

farmers and unions and the

Republicans ditch morality, they,

arrive at the same point: pro—corpo-
ratist rule, anti—democracy and anti-
morality. We are left with a
Republicrat party. '

But we have another choice -—-—
the V true “second” parties that

all running candidates in
2000. These folks seem
honest about their views,

preferable to the “big two.”

The Greens are the most plausi-
ble option.rRalph Nader is running
ahead of the Libertarians and Pat
Buchanan in-thepolls. He has the

best track record of concern ‘for our.

country and is highly motivated,
intelligent, thoughtful and sincere.

‘ Hence, the media ignores him.

They likewise do‘ not give
Buchanan equal airtime. He has a
number of negatives for
instance, his plans to burn" the
Watergate tapes before they became
common knowledge, or his virulent

_ xenophobia. On the other hand, he

for long enough learns that the‘

actually gives a damn about work- .

ing people and calls for moral

and many’ are highly-

behavior. I can’t recommend voting
for a racist and sexist, but Bush has
the same qualities and other nega-
tives to boot. I

If conservatives don’t like
Buchanan’s hatred, they can go to
Howard Phillips and the
Constitution Party. For those to the
far left who think Nader is too con-
servative, David McReynolds has a
strong socialist and pacifist back-
ground and seems like the perfect
candidate. ‘

Third parties still stand for
something; the’ Greens for environ-
mentalism, consumer protection and

control of corporations; the
Constitution Party for small govern-
ment and social morality; the

Libertarians for the rights of the rich .

and freedom to do your own thing
(aka anarchy); the Socialists for
income equality and a non-market
economy; and the Natural Law Party
for small government and an end to
partisan politics. There’s something
out there for almost anybody once
you look beyond the horizons.

Mischa Gelman‘ invites Pitt students
to dare to look beyond the

Republicrats for the party that suits

their views.

Every passerby is cruel, every situation

“Road Trip” begs to be compared
with other teen slapstick comedies like

“American Pie”. and “Can’t Hardly
Wait.” It’s only redeeming quality is its
gutter humor — Rubin, a drifting

It’s just another example of vogue out-
rageousness, imitating the legacy of

Irony and sarcasm aren’tiusually in the
vocabulary of a young person out on the
town on a Friday night, trying to get laid.‘ So
they might misunderstand the lyrics that
John Hogg has so painstakingly written for
the debut, self—titled album of A ’
his band Moke. They might
think that words like “I drop a
pill, I drink, I smoke like a

reggae and soul inspired rock
are an invitation to imbibe.
They are not.

Make no mistake kids, Moke is not on a
mission to spread the word of sobriety, it is
only a suggestion. But they will be here on
Friday to spread the word about their new
album at Banana Joe’s Island Complex in
the Strip.

Fans of the Manic Street Preachers will
be delighted to know that Moke has utilized
Dave Enringa to co-produce their ﬁrst

Undertheinﬂuence

 

  

album, which was recorded in London’s
Chiswick Reach Studios on classic 1950s
and ‘60s recording equipment to, as they say,
enhance their soul.

The ‘songs are about over—indu1gence, »

about Hogg’s battle with drugs and depres-
sion, but layered over Moke’s sound, the
lyrics are a bit hard to swallow. What they
describe as testosterone-diiven, I ﬁnd
upbeat, what they see as
melancholy, I would describe
as just slow. Perhaps this is
the irony of it all, though,
which I don’t  a bunch
of drunken girls and boys in

get I wonder if they will realize that Hogg is
using his life, layering it over upbeat tracks,
and mimicking the atmosphere of any bar or
club where people drink their cares away.
Whether or not Moke gets their point
across, Pittsburgh doesn’t get many bands
ﬁom London over here, so this would be an
excellent opportunity to see how the other

side does it — the other side of the Atlantic, -

that is.

“Teen Love,” ‘Mazzy Star’

“Be Mine’-’ which I found

all I cared to
listen to Sweden’s The Concretes debut
Boyyoubétterrunnow, soon to be
released by Up Records. But, hey, in
my new—found singleness, I forced
myself to be experimental.

And maybe that’s why I was so sur-
prised by what I found. Excluding the
first song on the album, “Teen Love,”
which is a quirky rendition of any open-
ing theme song on a ‘70s sitcom, the
rest of the album did a pretty fair job of
quenching my thirst for something to
take my mind off of things.

Started by a trio of Stockholm girls,
The Concretes has swelled to include
up to 18 members at times, complete

with a horn section and many key-
boards. They are known to only travel
by train, and to only play when and
where they
feel, in order

cally wonder-
ful, without
feeling the
dirty guilt of
playing “Fade

over and
over again.
“Vacation” . v
is pure pop, complete with harmonica,
while the rest of the album ﬂows up and
down, darting between upbeat and
melancholy, all the while never jarring’
you too much. It’s an album that’s easy
to swallow, and so breathtakingly full
of girl energy that I couldn’t help but
start to feel my toes tingling. It’s not
perfect, but I’m starting to learn that
most things aren’t. In the pop sense, this
comes as close as I’ve heard to pop in a
long time.

XTC

“Well my friends all said/Just climb
back in the saddle/Well my friends all
said/You won’t sink if you paddle.”

The songs themselves start sound-
ing the same by track three. While the
band switches between horns and
organs between songs and even drops
in a string section on “The Wheel and

FROM PAGE 12

the Maypole,” it is never enough to dis- "

tinguish the songs from each other. .
“Stupidly Happy”, is the most radio-

friendly. The lyrics are upfront and

promisingly dumb, “I’m stupidly

happy/I roll like a train/l’m stupidly __
happy/With you on my brain.” The

drums pump out 4/4 time and the dis-
torted vocal solo makes the track
cheesy enough to becharming.

The one song that really shines. is
“Boarded Up.” Feet stomping quickly

moves into the chant “Music venue has. . ‘
had its day/Deathwatch beetle band‘
moved in to play/GroupsIdon’t; comef

down from London way.” For a few
minutes all the smiles come off to show
a band that has struggled to gain recog-

nition from an industry they never com— _
pletely wanted to be a part of. If for no
other reason, the song is good because
it doesn’t like the rest of the album.

Wasp Star drags. Listen in small
doses.

The Pitt baseball team needed at least
two wins and some help from several teams
this weekend to make the Big East touma-
ment, something just short of a miracle.

They got it

Boston College fell victim to a come-
back victory by the Panthers on Sunday, giv-
ing Pitt the sixth and ﬁnal spot in the post-
season toumament starting Wednesday in
Bridgewater, NJ.

The Panthers and Eagles. split two
games on Saturday, putting Pitt in a must-
win situation on Sunday. Third baseman Joe
Lydic delivered the heroics with a 10th-
inning single with the bases loaded.

The Eagles were already‘  the '

No. 5 seed in the Big East tournament and
decided to give eight pitchers work in
Sunday’s meaningless game.

Pitt countered with left-hander Kevin
Lazeski to counter BC’s ﬁve left-handed hit-
ters in the lineup.

After two scoreless innings, the Eagles
scored the game’s ﬁrst run in the top of the
third.

A leadoff single by Brian Durkin was
followed by a single by Mike Hubbard

After a double play
allowed Durkin to move
to third base, Mike
Quirk singled off of
Lazeski to plate Durkin
with the ﬁrst 11111.

two more nms in the top

Eagles a 3-0 lead .

Brant Colamarino then singled in

bases again, and then Lenhart was plunked,

The players rushed out of the dugout to
congratulate Lydic and Charis Britt, who
scored the winning run, but Rossi was the
hero. p I —

He allowed just two hits in 5 1/3

innings, walking zero and striking out three

batters for his second  of the season. V
A “I just triedto getit to the outfrel ” said
‘ydic of his 10th-inning single. “Something

'  enough to score the run.”

Pitt ﬁnished the season with a 31-22

also the last time Pitt made the Big East tour-
nament.  I

The Panthers will open with No. l

If Pitt defeats Rutgers, the Panthers will

None Dame or Boston College at noon

fewthings, but Jeremy came in and did a

der of the year. First baseman Katie Mitchell
and shortstop T'1ﬁ”any Barrett both had bouts
with mononucleosis that kept Mitchell out
most of the year and Barrett out for eight
games toward the end of the season.

The Panthers lost three of their ﬁnal
four games, but were still rewarded when
Robin Johnston and Amy Steich were hon-
ored with second-team All-Big East selec-
tions. .

Seton Hall 3, Pitt 2; Pitt 1, Seton Hall 0
Pitt closed out conference play with a

' weekend trip to Seton Hall and St. John’s on

April 29-30. 4
The trip began with a doubleheader
against the Pirates which saw Pitt drop a
— tough decision in game one, but rebound
strongly to shut out ﬂue Pirates in the second
game.
In the ﬁrst game, Pitt took advantage of
three errors by Seton Hall to take a 2-1 lead

of the seventh, when Seton Hall connected
on three straight singles, setting up Marlena
Kotynski’s ﬁelder’s choice. which sent the
game-winning run across home plate.
In game two, Johnston gave Pitt the
only /run it would need to defeat the Pirates
in the ﬁrst inning. -
She ‘reached on a /single and then sco
on a sacriﬁce ﬂy by Barrett. After that, it was
all Gina Bessolo. Pitt’s starting pitcher
picked up her second shutout of the season,
allowing just three hits in the victory.

St. John’s 6, Pitt 2; St. John’s 3, Pitt 2
The Panthers moved from Seton Hall

up the Jersey Turnpike into New York City’s -

borough» of Queens, where they took on the
Red Storm of St. John’s on April 30. V
_ In game one, St. John’sjumpe'cl out to a
3-1 lead after two innings. Pitt mounted a
comeback in the third when Johnston hit an
RBI single. V
However, St. John’s put three runs on
the board in the bottom of the ﬁfth inning to
secure the victory. - -
In the second game, the score was tied
at one in the seventh inning when McCann
singled in Steich with the ‘go—ahead run. St.

John’s wouldn’t give up, though, and used a

solo home run to even the game in the bot-

tom of the seventh to force extra innings.
The game lasted 10 innings, tying it for

the longest of the season for the Panthers.

home run was Haar’s eighth of the season
and 23rd of her career.

The Raiders couldn’t ﬁgure out the

pitching of Pitt freshman Nikki Gasti, who
earned her 10th win of the season and sec-
ond shutout. .

Game two was a battle in which both
teams laid it all on the line. Wright State was
up 2-0 going into the seventh and ﬁnal
inning, but Pitt was not done. Senior Lisa
Backstrom hit her ﬁrst career homer in her
last collegiate game to tie the score at 2-2.

First baseman Tawni Yarnauchi then
gave Pitt the go—ahead rim later in the inning
with an RBI single.

However, the Raiders didn’t roll over,
either. A walk with the bases loaded by
Bessolo tied the game, and then a single
gave Wright State the victory.

Pitt ﬁnishedits third season with a 21-
28 record, improving by about ﬁve games
over last year’s 16-34-1 mark.

After ﬂie’ season ended, Johnston and
Steich were awarded with ﬂie all-conference
selections.

“They totally deserve it,” Phalen said.
“Especially in conference play, they stepped

Q up their games.”

Phalen pointed out that J_ohnston’s base
stealing was a major asset to the team and
helped the Panthers win a few games.

Steich came to Pitt as a second base-
man, but moved to center_ﬁeld last year.

“For Amy to go from second base to all-
conference in center ﬁeld is an amazing
thing,” Phalen said.

COLUMN

You know you’ve seen a great hockey-

game when ESPN Classic is replaying it
the next night as an “Instant Classic.” Since
that game ended, I’ve realized thatl saw
one of the greatest hockey games of all
time. A '0

Whenl say greatest, I don’t mean great
play by both teams. In fact, the play was far
from great in the overtime periods, when
the teams resembled preschoolers on the ice
rather than professional hockey players.

The effect of that game will be felt for
a long time. Hey, it won the series for
Philadelphia. Sure, you Flyers» fans might
disagree, but if the Penguins would have
won the game, I don’t think the Flyers
would have bounced back to win three
straight elimination games.

Also, it may have added a few million 0

dollars to the contract that Ron Tugnutt
signs during the off-season. When the Pens
acquired Tugnutt at the trade deadline, he
was expected to be a veteran backup to
rookie Jean-Sebastian Aubin.

But when Aubin was injured, Tugnutt __

stepped in and helped the Pens qualify for
the playoffs, dominate Washington in the
ﬁrst round and nearly upset the Flyers in the
second round-

All of this because of a game that
seemed to begin just like every other play-

' off game. Actually, it began as a game that

I expected to miss because of a previous
engagement. I thought I might be able to
make it back home to watch the third peri-

od, but little did I know that I would actua1- ’

ly watch almost two full games of hockey
because of the ﬁve overtimes.

I arrived about two minutes into the
third period, just after the Flyers had scored
the tying goal.

The more and more I think about it, the
more I realize how amazing the game was.
It was seven hours long! I couldn’t skate for
seven minutes without getting tired and
falling down, much less seven hours!

Throughout the ﬁrst and second over-
times, I was very tense, hoping that the Pens
didn’t give up any easy chances for the
Flyers. T

After that,-there was the third OT peri-
od, in which both teams had power play
chances. After those failed, I gave up. I was
still cheering and hoping for a Penguins
victory, but my tense mood had changed. I
was delirious.

I began laughing at the futile attempts

Are You

by both teams to skate up and down the ice.

Passes were bad. Shots were even
worse. And the ice, on an already warm day
in the city, was about as soft and runny as
pudding.

Then there were the fans. By the time 0

Keith Primeau won the game for Philly in

the ﬁfth OT, Mellon Arena was two—thirds‘

empty. If you watched the game on TV, you
would have thought that number was even
less, because the Fox Sports Pittsburgh tele-
cast showed the same six fans the entire
game.

I’m sure the Penguins will look back at
that game and wonder, “What it?”

But they needn’t do that The mystique
of that game alone brought the Penguins to

the forefront of the news in the city. Even.

though the ﬁrst season under new owner
Mario Lernieux is over, it was deﬁnitely a
success. Season ticket sales went up, and

because the team won its ﬁrst round series
over the Capitals, early projections are that
the team broke even ﬁnancially.

Just think, if the Pens would have
missed the playoffs, we would be right back
Where we started. Lemieux might not have
been able to keep the team another year. But
this team is so much better than they were
at the beginning of the season that I see
nothing but a bright future for the franchise.

If you would have told me two months
ago that the Penguins would have made it
to the second round of the playoffs before
losing, I would have been happy. And that’s
all I ask for. V

Mario Machi is the sports editor of The Pitt
News and he wishes the game could have
gone to a sixth overtime so he could have

played the tiebreaking game of darts with

his roommate.
