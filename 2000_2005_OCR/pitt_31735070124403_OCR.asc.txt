Drunken college students chug beer
and grind together. '

“Lauren” is especially drunk. She
can’t stand up straight any longer. Her
thin shirt strap has fallen off her shoul-

g der. A

“Jeff” is hitting on her_. They. chug a
beer, then Jeff gives her a shot. , He
wants to get her out of the party.

' “We can go back to my place. My
roommates aren’t there,” Lauren says.

Back at Lauren ’:s suite, Jeff assaults her.

This ‘ is a scene .from Residence

the Public Health Building.

Though intended for freshmen,
anyone could come get something out
of the play, actor Nate .Fish said.

“Sometimes when you’re at a party,
you don’t seewhat is going on. When

you step ‘back and see it, you might

think about things more,” Fish said.
J The play explores some of the dan-

gerous situations in which someone

who drank too "much may find himself,’

from embarrassing ‘antics committed in

a drunken stupor to the real dangers of
assault and rape. _ '_

Staff Writer

Carol Knox came prepared to
attract attention.
a The founder of, the Blitz on
Banksville Beautification Project,
an organization devoted to cleaning

up Banksville Street near the Fort '

Pitt tunnel, wore large pieces of
pink cloth tied into small ﬂowers.

“It’s our foxglove outfit,”
explained Nancy Gusky, Knox’s
partner on this windy, day. “The
foxglove is a beautiful ﬂower, and
our organization is trying to beauti-
fy Pittsburgh.”

Knox wasn’t the onlyione trying
to catch the. eye of students as rep-
resentatives from 83 non-profit
organizations lined up on the lawn
of the William Pitt Union yesterday
for . the Student Volunteer
Outreach’s Volunteer Fair.

Latosha Means, a sophomore at

Pitt and a volunteer for the East
End Corporate Ministry, a division
of Americorps, tried a more direct’
approach than Knox’s eye-catching"

attire. ‘

“Excuse me,” she asked, ﬂag-_

ging down a . hesitant student,
“Would you be interested in volun-
teering to help the elderly or tutor
children?” '

Many organizations favored the
notion that the way to a student’s ,

heart was through his or her stom-

ach. Twizzlers, Tootsie Rolls,
Sweet Tarts and other candy treats
lined the various tables around the
lawn.

“No one’s even had a Tootsie

. Roll today except for me, I think,”

said the Rev. Bruce Foster. Foster is
also part of the ‘East, End
Cooperative Ministry, a program,
that sponsors both after school
tutoring programs for school-chil-
dren and adult day careprograms
for the elderly. Foster noted that

despite the total disregard for his’

candy," he had gotten a" number of
prospective volunteers.

Across the ‘lawn at the Greater
Pittsburgh Literary Cou_ncil’s table,
the ‘candy had to be "rationed.
Recruiters Janelle Thomas‘ and
Deborah Meade would only give
outcandy if a passerby asked them
a- question relative to their organi-

zation. - '

Despite such strict guidelines,

D Thomas had ‘fi11_ed'three“ ‘pages’ or a
legal» paper‘ with signatures before
. the day had ended‘. > ~ ' .

y “This is our third fair ‘in the pas
week,”»_ Thomas said.”And this has

been by the far ‘the best response 7

_.  into Oakland for the
kfirjst time, Nick Tagliela’s eyes
. wandered from the symbolic
"Cathedral of Learning to the three

buildings that he thought resembled
giant garbage cans. ' ‘

along Forbes and Fifth avenues,

:_.better known as the Litchfielld

Towers, arehome to the majority of

-Z _ _l?i-tt’s freshman population. r _
if ..".‘.'V,.ll_her;i_j’,_;f4,,I,,_.‘f7:i;,_rt_:_j_es,t got here, I thought

‘my room wasso small and I’d never

have enough room for “anything,”

said Tagliela, who lives in Tower B.
“But despite‘ size and appearance,
they are the best thing “on campus
for freshmen as far as meeting peo-
ple.” . . ‘

Although living in Towers can
make a person feel cramped and
desperately needing of privacy-,'not
to mention abathroom with soap

and paper towels, Tagliela’s opinion '

that the Towers are a safe and socia-
ble place for freshmen adjusting to
college is one shared bymany pre-
sent and former Towers residents.

I Jessica Fischer of Tower B said
that although her room is smaller
and less clean than what she is
accustomed to ‘at home, she is, for

. the most part, comfortable with her

living situation. . _
“My roommate and I get along
real well,” Fischer said. “I haven’t

gotten to know half my ﬂoor, but

everyone else is fine. We all go out

to dinner and go to parties togeth-

er.” I a - _ '
Tower A resident .Carrie

Peterson knew her roommatefrorn

high schoo1,gbut still becameclose

friends with her other ﬂoormates.
‘_‘Living here is definitely an

"easy way to make friends and meet

V, new people,” Peterson said.

Tagliela has formed close bonds
with people in his Tower as well.

“rm pretty tight with the guys

on the floor below me,” Tagliela
said. “If there» are ' any problems
security-wise with-people trying to
get onto. our ﬂoors, we take care of
it.” , .
Peterson,.however, said that she

‘feels safe»-and that security in her

     in    the"‘giant

 Tower seems sufficient.”

“It’s annoying to sign"-pero.ple in
all the time and also whenithe -card
swiping machines break down,”
Peterson said. “But 'it’s good that
they don’t just let anyone in.”

Other students like Fischer are I

disturbedﬁby‘ minor security prob-

lems that could be easily avoided-,i

butlmake some students feel unsafe.
‘‘I’m a little concerned about the
safety‘ here,” Fischer said. “Those
glass doors on‘ every third floor that
are supposed to "lock never; do
because people always b1oc_k€_them
off with shoes or other objects.”

Fires are uncommon and smok-e

ing is prohibited in the Towers as in
all dorms, b.ut proper precautions
are taken during potential emergen-
cies. V A

Hilary Herman, a junior now

~ living off-campus, said that false
fireﬁalarms were annoying when she

lived’ in Towers, but that she felt
very secure knowing that the alarms
worked. P .

“I never smelled smoke, but I

remember waking upvandjhaving to q

evacuate,” Herman said. “It was an

"jannoying process because there

were a bunch of really tired people
crammed into the [Towers patio] in
the freezing cold.” ‘
Herman also added that there
are many benefits of Tower life that
off-campus residents do not
receive, such as heat, air condition-
ing and a very convenient location.
“I” met all my best friends fresh-
man year,” she said. _ .
“Despite all the messes and bad

I smells coming form the bathroom, I

miss all my friends coming into my
room Wednesday nights to watch

-TV.aa ‘ V . V '
As far as ‘studying goes, some

students live on quiet ﬂoors, while
others are not disturbed by constant

chattering in the hallways or other
noises coming from the other -19
pie-shaped ‘rooms’ on every floor.

Still others opt for the ‘library.

But with so many neighbors,“ :5

easy Internet access anda cafeteria
and gym right downstairs, it is
understandable that some students
become preoccupied. _ ’

‘.‘I just procrastinate,” Tagliela

said. “I haven’t had to go to the" " 

library yet.”

It is a well—known fact that college
students love free stuff. What students
may not know is that free offers are

’ practically everywhere on the Intemet.-

This “free. stuff’ includes product
samples, catalogs, coupons and other
services like long—distance calling.

Whether you enjoy trying new
products, need to save money or just
enjoy receiving mail, these sites are
worth checking out .

“Free stuff on the Internet is great.
It’s great to send away for free stuff and
get mail once in a while,” said student
Maria Briski. “There’s so ‘much free
stuff on the _Internet,‘it’s not just about
getting free. product samples,” she said.

“Sometimes they offer great ser-
vices like free long-distance. Things
like that are great for students who are
far away from their family and friends,”
Briski said. I

Freesamples.com, a new site, lets

members select three or four samples.

per day from categories including beau-

, ty, health, entertainment, candy, food

and beverages, ‘household A items and
personal care. Sometimes, these prod-
ucts come in the mail—in sample sizes,

but sometimes the site sends a coupon

which is redeemable for a free trial
product. The samples from this site
come fairly quickly —' in about a week
-—— as opposed to other sites that may

-«take six to eight weeks to deliver.

Totallyfreestufﬁcom, another place
to ﬁnd free stuff on the Internet, adds
new free offers every day. It differs
from freesamplescom. in that it does
not provide the products itself. Instead,
it lists links to companies that have spe-
cial promotions on their Web sites.
Categories of links on this site include
catalogs, CD-ROMS, clothing, contests,

their
Phonehog.com offers 10 minutes of _

coupons, food, health and beauty,

posters and product samples. The site
V lists its best offers in its “featured free-

bies” section. ,
CoolsaVings.com offers a variety of
discounts and coupons. Although this
site primarily offers discounts for
online shopping, it also provides
coupons that can be printed from a

' computer or catalogs that come through c
the mail. This site divides its offers into .

a coupons and savings section and a
free stuff section. Categories in these
sections include back-to—school sav-

ings, books and magazines, clothing

and accessories, computers and elec-
tronics, health and beauty, music and
movies, dining and entertainment,

money and investing services and trav— —

el information. I

Members also earn “Cool Points”
for taking advantage of certain offers.
These “Cool Points” can be traded in
for gifts ranging from a $10

"Blockbuster Video giftcertificate to a

three—night vacation to one of the
Marriott Suites hotels. .

At Keldons.com/freebies, Web
surfers can select from_ an immense col-
lection of free offers. Hundreds of prod-

_ uct samples are divided into categories

including “coupon alley,” “the desk,”

“the kitchen” and “the medicine chest.” , ‘

Keldons.‘com/freebies also provides an
extensive list of products that are free
after rebate. Another list has contests
and sweepstakes. '

For students who need help with
long—distance phone bills,

free long—distance just for becoming a
member. Members can also earn extra
minutes for each friend they refer tothe

‘site. Phonehog.com ' also e—mails its
members with advertisements and 1

offers. Taking the time to read these e-

mails and respond offers earns extra _'

long-distance, minutes as well.

FAIR

huge success.
“It’s a beautiful day, and’ the
turnout is just fabulous,” she said.
Jean Park, volunteer coordina-
tor for SVO, thought‘ the event was
a great way for students to get
informed about the different oppor-
tunities available to them.
“Volunteering does a. lot for the
Volunteer as well as the organiza-
tion,” Park noted. '
“[It’s] a great way to develop
communication and leadership
skills, an easy way for studentsto
explore career opportunities, and
volunteer positions are great
resume builders.” -
Park said that many students
wanted to volunteer but were afraid

FROM PAGE 2

their schedules or lack of trans-

portation would limit them;

,~ “Many organizations are happy
to get volunteers whenever they are
available,” Park said. _

She also explained that SVO
provides transportation for students
to 70 percent of the off—campus vol-
unteer activities with which it is
affiliated.

Emmanuel Taylor, a junior
majoring in finance, "stumbled on
the fair while walking to class.

“I found a few organizations I
was interested in,” said Taylor, who
wanted to become involved with
youth and tutoring programs.

Taylor added that he was
impressed with the enthusiasm and
presentation of many of the organi-
zations that lined thelawn.

Students, who were unable to

attend the volunteer fair can still
V find places to volunteer throughout
‘Pittsburgh. . _, «

“But I’m a Cheerleader”
Directed by Jamie Babbit

tit

OLIVER B. JOHNSON Ill

Staff Writer

“But I’m a Cheerleader” opened July
15, so why am I reviewing it ._ .
now? Because some
movies tend to pass over
those of us in Western
Pennsylvania

So when ,j
“Cheerleader” ﬁnally
opened in Pittsburgh, I
decided to take a chance.

What’s the big deal? It’s just a
romantic comedy, right? Well, kind of ——

  

there are some new ingredients in this stew. ,

The girl doesn’t chase the guy, and the guy
doesn’t woo the girl, but the end results are
the same, in a way.

Are you confused yet? How does girl-

    
  
 
  

chases- girl or boy-c'hases—boy sound? This is
a romantic comedy about sexual disorienta-
tion; however, it is no “Boys on the Side.”
This is just a fun little story about ﬁnding
yourself and ﬁnding someone to share with;
in that way, it is no different from any other
teen romance. ’

Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is your nor-
mal high school girl 4 she’s 17, has lots of
friends, a nice boyfriend and she’s a cheer-

leader. But Megan is not all that she appears -

to be. Her locker is decorated "with pictures
of beautiful women, she eats tofu and thinks

about her cheerleadingiﬁiends while she ,

kisses her boyfriend. So it
makes sense that her par-
ents and classmates
would think she’s a
lesbian.

Andwhat would

any nonnal, loving
Catholic parents do?
Send her to a gay depre-

gramrmng camp to ﬁx her
“problem,” of course. i , . ,-
Thisbootcarnp-likeplaceisrunby
Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty). Mary is
ﬁerce as the stereotypical evil character, but
tl’l6 fact that her son might be gay heightens
the oornic effect. Moriarty’s brashness con-

trasts cornpletely withthe carnp’s decor, and
helps "keep the pace of the movie.

RuPaul, not in drag, plays the gay-
turned-straight instructor, Mike. Obviously,
Mikeisn’tas straight as-he seems, andrnakes
for an ironic role model. —

The way that “But I’m a ‘Cheerleader’
jokes about a such a serious" subject while not

overlooking its importance is well done.’

Some of the things that the characters do and
say are rather short—sighted, but remember
that some people really ﬂiink this way.

With cinematography straight from the
TV show “Clueless,” the writers intended to
express the fact that this is just like every

other romantic comedy. See it in theaters"

now because it may well become a, cult clas-

sic as “Welcome to the Dollhouse” did.

“Another Eart ”

Through Oct. 22

ERIC LIDJI
The Pitt News

If a lava lamp married a Nikon,
“Another Earth” would be their first
child.

“Another Earth” is a series of 28
photographs of regular and recogniz-
able landscapes and cityscapes, with
very irregular coloring, taken by Post-
Gazette photographer Bill Wade.
Skies are orange and pink, grass is
blue and rocks are green.

It was created using a technique
called cross-processing, in which

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
    
 
 
  
   

color negative film is devel-
oped as a positive transparen-
cy. This can be usedto make
regular images look wild.

The interesting thing about
Wade’s work is that while the color
is noticeably abnormal, it does not
immediately strike you as being out of
place. For instance, -Andy Warhol’s
series “Monroe,” where shocking col-
ors are painted on and outside the
lines of a photo of Marilyn Monroe,
definitely shows brashness. Wade’s
photos are more subtle. In what might

‘ _ be ,a mellow
tribute, one of
tWade’s pho-
tographs shows
Warhol’s grave.

The images
I are simple:
 ; Niagara Falls,
for example,
and
, Pittsburgh sky-
line. They are
not pho-

tographs of

*ble situ-
ations ,
but they
are not
.supposed to

be. Imagine waking
up one day to find the Earth’s colors
have drastically changed. —— every.-
thing becomes fascinating. The
impression the images give is one of
landing. on another earth. The exhibit
comes across as at documentaryof this
parallel World Wade stumbled across.

the ‘

incredi- '

That world is the main focus of
the exhibit. Of the 28 pieces, only two
include people. One is of retiredfolk

on Miami’s South Beach, and the

   

other is in O’Hare airport in Chicago. _

The majority of the work is either
forests, hills and open fields, or
famous places like the‘ Vietnam
Veterans Memorial and. :_ the
Washington Monument. - ‘
It’s not a “deep” exhibit — L did-
n’t walk away knowing anything‘
more about myself or the World -—— but
it is a very enjoyable and entertaining
one. I walked down the gallery hall

, several times andonly left because it

was getting late, and there were some
photographs that I wished I could take
home with me. ‘ , A

There will be a reception on
Friday from 7 to 10 p.m. with a mul-
timedia presentation at 8 p.m. If you
ﬁnd yourself looking for something to
do, do yourself a favor. and see
“Another Earth.” Maybe you’ll buy a
print. a ’
C It might even match your lava
lamp. ' I >-

The Greater Pittsburgh T

Renaissance Festival‘ I
Through Sunday

KATE WHITMORE

The Pitt News

Mark Haller doesn’t live anywhere, but
he has a passion for glass and a penchant
toward tunics. One year ago he packed his
bags, let his apartment lease expire and hit
the Renaissance Festival circuit

He currently shows off his glass blow-
ing talent at the Greater Pittsburgh
Renaissance Festival in—New Stanton, Pa.,
wherehe’s been joined by other artisans and
performers forisix weekends of mer— I
riment and revelry. .

Walkinginto the fes-
tival is like stepping into V
another era A shirtless, : .. ' 
sweaty man might
stagger drunkenly past
the entrance, but he’s
probably one of the “beg-
gars” hired to wander this village.

Chanting and cheering erupts to the I

right, in the directionof the King’s Field of
Honor. Sir James the Red anddhis nemesis
Sir Thomas, Knight of Wales, are jousting.
James is the crowd’s favorite — they contin-
uously shouting his name.

“Murder, murder, mutilate,” yells one
passionate fan as the knights get ready for
another pass. The jousting plays out like
medieval WWF, and the crowd can’t seem
to get enough ‘

The audience for “Mucksterpieoe
Theatre” has equal enthusiasm for a show
that sends people ﬂying into a pit of mud
“Head and face! Head and face!” chants the
crowd, urging one of the performers to fur-
ther drench himself with the slimy dirt. He
obliges but then promptly runs through the
crowd, smearing mud randomly on specta-
tors.

“This is a very unique experience com-

pared to other fairs,” said Mary Kirnmel of

 

the muckster’s antics. “I come back every
year.”

Kirnmel, unlike some attendees, chose '
not to wear a costume to the festival. The _

more adventurous lord or lady, however, can
always rent a frock from Jodie Boyd.

- Boyd runs the Gather in Time tent For I
$30 a day, adults can dress themselves in her

handmade gowns made in medieval and

A Renaissance styles.

“We try to stay as authentic as possible)’

- Boyd said. “The medieval outﬁts tend to be _
much more comfortable [than one might _ :

suppose.]’’_ » V g . .
I She said she. notices an 
transformation in her customers’ attitudes

once they’re wearing her garb, especially the I

teenage girls.

ﬁght over the nearest mirror and admire their

young girls from the hired help are the tell- ,.

tale platform sneakers undemeath

McMahon’s stat

One look into the newspapers
for the latest odds on this week’s
college fo_otball games has me

befuddled. '

, The (Pitt-Rutglers game is off the

line, which means there is no decent

estimate or line that the Las Vegas
oddsmakers can put on the game.

I know Mike McMahon, the
Rutgersquarterback, was in a sling
after’ Saturday’s loss to Virginia
Tech, but his coach said he’ll proba-
bly play. V ’ A V . ,

Regardless, most teams are start-
ing_ conference play, which means
closer games and more wrong picks
coming your way.

secutive week, -bringing my record
for the year to 10-7.

“This was planned by our cap-
tains during the summer,”
Pasqualoni said. “It came at a good
time after losing to Cincinnati.”

Mianiiready for impressive West
Virginia defense

Even though they are averaging
over 500 yards a game on offense
and have three talented running
backs, Miami head coach Butch
Davis thinks that the Hurricanes will
have to watch out for West
Virginia’s defense.

“They look like one of the better
teams we will play this year,” said
Davis. “Their defensive front seven
may be the biggest I’ve seen in the
past few years.”

Davis feels that the West
Virginia secondary is much like
Miami’s a few years ago .— young.

Even with that in mind, he doesn’t
expect to be able to go deep on them
often.

Hokies get help from everyone
against Rutgers
Virginia Tech head coach Frank

- Beamer was happy with not justhis

team’s win over Rutgers last week,
but also with the fact that everyone
contributed.

“It feltireally good to have.

everyone playing hard,” Beamer
said. Everyone is trying to get bet-
ter. Our offense made some quick
plays, and the defense took a big
step.” -

Beamer also thought his special
teams played extremely well in
Saturday’s game. ,

“We got a great game from our
kicking teams and coverage teams,”
Beamer said. “You have to have the
best people on special teams,
regardless of who they are. It takes a
lot of skill to make the kindslof
plays they make.”

And finally, does my picture
scare anyone else besides me? _

0 This weekend at Three Rivers
Stadium, Pitt (3-0) hosts the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights (2-1).
Saturday’s game isvPitt’s Big East
opener and it is a big one.

Pitt should‘ have no trouble

squashing its foe, but must avoid a’

letdown after the emotional victory
just a week ago. .
Last week was as emotional as a
game can get. .
A Many players compared the
feeling to the euphoric atmosphere
of last year’s Notre Dame game.
Pitt‘ and its fans were on a high.
But in order to be a. winner, one
cannot get too high or too low.

After a crushing 20-13 loss to
Penn State in 1998, the Panthers hit
rock bottom.

The team won just one more
game that season, finishing with a
record of 2-9. ‘ .

One of the many horrible losses
came to a team from New Jersey,
named Rutgers.

‘ After trailing most of the game,

.the Scarlet‘ Knights came from

behind and escaped from Pitt
Stadium with a 25-21 win.

Believe it or not, this game is
the momentum builder. With a vic-
tory, Pitt heads into Syracuse with a
4-0 record.

lesser opponents. If the Panthers
want to be a top 25 team they‘ must
demolish Rutgers.

And if the students of this uni-
versity want their team in the top 25
they must support their team more
than once or twice a year.

' There were over 60,000 fans
packed into Three Rivers for the

3' Penn State game.

It is no coincidence that Pitt

won. A team thrives off of the.

excitement from the crowd.

There is nothing better to do on
Saturday afternoons at 3:30 than to
watch live football.

Pitt has talent and there is no
reasonunot to go support this team.

Pitt should win decisively over
the Scarlet Knights.

Support this team. Pitt will

your team brings great things, right
