The statistics are numerous, and
they pile up until the women behind
them get lost.

0 Somewhere in America a woman
is battered, usually by her intimate part-
ner, every 15 seconds.

- Every 21 hours on each college
campus in the United States, there is a
rape.

- A woman is most likely to experi-
ence an , assault during her first two
months of college.

These statistics, from the United

Nations Study on the Status of Women’

in 2000 and Campus Outreach
Services, are the reason for V-Day, a

growing movement aimed at eliminat-;

ing violence against women. .

V-Day began with Eve Ensler, a
playwright, activist and ‘screenwriter,
who interviewed women from around
the world about the fundamental, but
taboo, subject of their vaginas and
named the resulting play “The Vagina
Monologues.” - .

Peppered with vitriolic rants and
words that would make a truck driver
blush, the play, ﬁrst performed in 1998',

has" been provocative from‘ the start; 0,

Titles of . scenes in the play include “The

' Little Coochii Snortcher that Could,”

and “My Angry Vagina.” In the spirit of
empowering women and 1 eliminating
violence. against them, A groups ‘across

the country perform ‘‘The ‘Vagina '
. ’ Monologues” on or around: Va1entine’s ’
"V Day. ’

by Ensler first performed the play as a
one.-woman ~off—Broadway. show, but
prominent ‘ actresses began asking if

they could perform it, and the script

was altered to allow for three actresses.
“The Vagina Monologues” are some of
the most. popular roles for actresses

these days, and Claire Danes, Calista

CSSD increases campus
computer system bandwidth

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer 0

For the connoisseurs of online
file sharing at Pitt, life is getting
good really fast. .

Computing Services and
Systems Development, the body
that manages computing and net-
working at Pitt, is in the process of
increasing the bandwidth available
to students and staff tenfold, from
100 megabits to a gigabit — 1000
megabits — of connectivity.

Bandwidth functions like a
highway for information and each

computer on the network is ad

metaphorical car. By increasing the
amount of bandwidth that the Pitt
network has available, CSSD is
‘allowing more space for each indi-
vidual user, much like widening a
highway would.

What that means for students in
practical terms is decreased down-
load times and better performance
from Internet applications.

Josh Hall, »a Residential
Networking employee, said that the
upgrade process will have varied
effects, depending _on the building
in which the network connection is
located.

“You may not see it as much in

the residence halls,’’, Hall said,"

“because they have to go through
the PPPoE.”

PPPOE, or point.—to-point proto-
col over Ethernet, is the server that
connects students in the dorms and
other buildings to the backbone of
the network.

“It’s kind of like a gateway,”
Hall said. ' -

There are six “hub” buildings,
according the information technolo-
gy Web site, through which the
backbone runs directly. -

“[The backbone] is our big
cable coming to [those sites] and all
of the branches off that are what go
to the buildings like the Towers,”
Hall said.

Even though the server may.

limit the speed ofyconnections in
the‘ residence halls slightly, Hall

said that the upgrade should still be

significant.

Hall also said that another
effect of the upgrade should be
increased stability of the network.

“Hopefully,3’ Hall said, “[the «a
‘ network] won’t go down as much.”

Just like widening a highway,
reducing network congestion and
wear and tear on the road surface,
increasing bandwidth should make
the network less prone to failure.

“It isn’t gonna be 100 percent
foolproof,...but it should be easier
on the network,” Hall said.

Students in the- dorms have
noticed improvements already."

“My things have been popping
up faster,” said freshman Kelley
Dimmick on the improved perfor-
mance of her Internet browser.

Nikole Kaiser, also a freshman,
said that downloading MP3 files
through-programs such as Kazaa
Media Desktop has been easier.

“I did one this afternoon,”
Kaiser said, “and as _soon as I

clicked over to traffic [status win-'

dow], it was done.” _
Not all students are impresse
with the improvements, though.
Gerrica Gramling, a junior, said
that she hasn’t noticed dramatic
changes in the labs or kiosks on
campus. . A
“When. it seems to be moving
slow, I just figure the -network’s
down or something,” Gramling

said.

She also said that the difference
might be difficult to notice in most
contexts. '

“If you were logging in before
and it took five seconds and now it
takes two and a half seconds,
you’re not really going to notice it,”
Gramling said. -

‘The upgrades are the third
phase of a larger,‘ multi—year plan to
keep Pitt’s network upto date.‘ The
plan, called the Gigabit Project,
was started in August 1999, with
the first phase completed in March

'2000; For more information on the

Gigabit Project, V visit ' the

Telep appointed unanimously  
to fill student governmentvid  

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

After scant open—floor comments from the
public at last night’s Student Government
Board meeting, it took the board just nine min-
utes to privately deliberate before naming
Rainbow‘Alliance President Sandra Telep as its
newest member.

“I’ve never seen our board so unified in
any decision,” said member Michelle Agostini.

Although the decision was formally
announced after just minutes, President Pro-
Tempore Meghan Fetzer announced that the
group met Sunday night for a lengthier private
session before coming to a conclusion. Fetzer
led last night’s meeting because President Jeff
Alex was in Harrisburg lobbying for funding
for the University.

The open floor portion of yesterday’s meet-
ing was an attempt by the board to allow stu-
dents to voice their praise or concern for can-
didates. Despite a full audience, only two stu-
dents took advantage of that opportunity.

The board was unanimous in its support for
Telep. The group agreed that the speed and
ease with which Telep was selected was
remarkable. Member Kevin Washo echoed the
sentiments of the rest of the board when he said
he was excited to work with her. “You brought

a lot of good ideas to the table,” he said;
Agostini said, 7‘This will be the first-‘time in
a long time that I’ll be able to go homeja'nAd—not  , i
be mad after a meeting.” ‘ ‘  I . V
Telep replaces President Pro—Tempore"
Carrie Howard, who was removed from. the
board after four unexcused absences from‘ pub-
lic meetings. The board held interviﬂewsgfor -
every student who applied for the position Jan. -
8. According to its constitution, only a simple 
majority vote is necessary.to name a replace-
ment for a member who has been removed. .
Telep said that given the brevity of her
term — it only lasts through this academic year
— she is choosing to focus on one issue. As
president of Rainbow Alliance, she said she
has done a lot of work to recruit and retain stu-
dents in the homosexual community. As a
board member, she saidfshe hopes to expand
her horizons and work on recruiting and retain-
ing all kinds of students. She also said that
because she graduates this summer,’ she does
not plan to use her new position as a spring-
board to a year-long appointment - during
April-’s election. A
After the meeting, Telep was still beaming.
“I’m honored, and I’m really touchedby the
support of the whole board,” she said. “I’m
going to do everything _I can to live up to that
enthusiasm.” V V ‘ '

Cruising even faster on the
information superhighway

More porn. .

Sadly, this has likely been the innate
response of certain Pitt students upon hear-
ing that Computing Services and Systems
Development recently increased bandwidth
for the Pit network tenfold.

For the technologically un-sawy, here’s
a quick overview. Imagine that bandwidth is
a pipe, and every time we access Internet
applications on the Pitt system, we cause
water to ﬂow through that pipe. When too
many people use the Internet at once, the
pipe becomes strained; consequently, it takes
longer to utilize applications.

With the increase in bandwidth from
100 megabits per second to one gigabit per
second, traﬂic should ﬂow much more
smoothly. Students using Pitt computers or
Ethernet connections should notice that
since CSSD’s upgrade, Internet activities
such as downloading songs or even loading
Web sites take considerably less time.

So, using the Pitt system, you can now
download more mp3s, send more
Valentine’s day e-greetings to that
long—distance lover or import more images
of your favorite Internet god or goddess in
less time.

There’s a caveat, though: even on our
new, faster superhighway, traﬁic jams can
still occur at rush hour. Certain activities —
such as video conferencing and, yes, down-
loading pom'— consume a hefty amount of

bandwidth.

Fortunately, the solution is relatively
simple. If you want to download Michael
Bolton mp3s because you’re too ashamed to
buy the CD in person, that is your preroga-
tive. Similarly, if importing “racy” pictures
from Web sites whose names are not meant
to be spoken in polite society is your thing,
then pursue your interests by all means.

But please try to avoid indulging in
these fascinating hobbies during peak hours,
like afternoon and early evening. lfwe all go
buck wild engaging in shady Internet activi-
ties 24 hours a day, high levels of congestion
will still occur —— making it more
time—consuming to , send a simple, honest
e-mail. ‘

Besides, should you really be spending
your prime socializing years in front of a
bright, blinking screen? And no, chatting on
Instant Messenger does not count as
socializing. '

CSSD’s continual upgrades are certain-
ly beneﬁcial, but their potential implications
are dangerous. In addition to being a center
of learning, Pitt is also proudly a party
school, a drinking school, a university with a
varied and vibrant social community. Big
bandwidth or not, we must keep our Internet
usage in check. . .lest we acquire a reputation
similar to that of a certain socially inept,
computer-crazed private university just up
Forbes Avenue.

Politicians would do well to remember

Happy New Year again? It’s about time

“Its all the samef—~-ing day, man. ” —Janis
Joplin

Today, besides being Abraham
Lincoln’s l93rd birthday, marks the start of
the Year of the Horse and begins the 15-day
Spring Festival for more than a ﬁfth of the
world’s people.

Gregorian solar calendar, now the world-
wide standard civic calendar, is Pope
Gregory XllI’s 1582 ‘revision of the Julian,
done chieﬂy to keep Easter from slipping
into surnrn er.

Our year probably begins on January 1,
as opposed to the winter solstice or spring
equinox, because that was

For those who don’t know,
the 12 animals of the'Chinese
zodiac represent years rather
than months. The Chinese cal-
endar is “luniso ,” meaning
it’s based on the 29.5 days
between equal‘ phases of the
moon as well as the 365.25 days
ittakestheearthtogoaround

 

when the Roman senate ses-
sion began. The reasons why
the months have different
numbers of days, and why the
extra day in leap year comes in
February and not at the end of
the year are similarly historical
"rather than logical. ‘
There have been more

added every few years tokeep it Columnist endars proposed, but I don’t

The Chinese system of numbering years _cosmic calendar that started with the Big

is not linear but cyclical. The Yellow
Emperor is said to have invented the calen-
dar in 2637 before common era. We are start-
ing the 19th year of the 79th 60 year—cycle.
That would make this the 4699th Chinese
New Year —— but who’s counting?

Because calendars serve political and
social ﬁmctions, civilizations have generally
marked some event of their own as so enor-
mously signiﬁcant that they reset the calen-
dar over it. The Chinese started again from
year one with each new emperor until the
throne was abolishedin l91l.Then time was
restarted once again, so in Taiwan we would
now be in Year 91 of the Republic of China

Ifthis all seems confusing and arbitrary,
consider our own system for measuring
time, which makes about as much sense as
the Electoral College. The Julian calendar,
Julius Caesar’s 46 B.CE. reform of the slop-
py old Roman calendar, counts years from
the founding of Rome. The Roman abbot
Dionysius Exiguus in 527 AD reckoned
Jesus Christ’s birth date as March 25 in the
754th year since the founding of Rome and
began numbering from then. Hence the
term, “Year of Our Lord” — anno Domini,
orA.D.

Christwas actually born atleast4years
earlier than he ﬁgured, but the Dionysian
“time mo” is the one we still use. The

Bang 15 billion years ago or so,_but I don’t

know if that would work for dental

appointments.

There are actually about 40 calendars in
use today around the world, some of them
pretty different from our own The Balinese
year has 210 days and a systemof weeks that
range from one to ten days long and may run
concurrently. The Islamic lunar calendar,
where we are now in year 1422, begins
counting the years with Mohamed’s move
from Mecca to Medina. The Jewish luniso-
lar calendar starts from no less important an
event than the creation of the world, which is
said to have happened 5763 years ago, on
Monday, October 7, 3761 B.C.E., a little

'after10p.m.

Particularly after a revolution, people
often get the urge to wipe the slate of history
clean and start from scratch. The makers of
the French Revolution declared 1793 as Year
One. These guys were so into the decimal
system that they made weeks 10 days long
and even redid the clock to 10 hours of 100

-minutes of 100 seconds each. I think it

sounds cool, but Napoleon didn’t. He did
away with it in 1806, shortly after he

_ declared himself emperor.

Po1Pot’s Khmer Rouge also said they
were starting time over in 1975. Yeah, right.
If I’m going to Y2K my stuff, it better be

over something really important, like when
man ﬁrst walked on the moon, or the ﬁrst
time the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan.

The day and the year at least make sense
asunitsoftime.Icanfee1those.Butinour
calendar the month has nothing to do with
the moon (who keeps track of the phases of
moon anyway?). The week is sort of a quar-
ter-month, maybe, but ever since Genesis it’s
mostly been a way of counting down until
somebodygetsadayoff. , p A

There is nothing “natural” about sec-
onds, minutes or horns, either. They’re all
just subdivisions of the sundial based on the
4000-year-old Babylonian habit of counting
in base 60. (And here’s me still using my ﬁn-
gers!) Worse yet, for the sake of more accu-
rately synchronizing our watches, the second
is now officially deﬁned as “9,l92,631,77O
periods of the radiation corresponding to the
transition between the two hyperﬁne levels
of the ground state of cesiurn-133.” What
ever happened to A “Mississippi one,
Mississippi two?”

ILLUSTRATION BY ROBBIE ALI/COLUMNIST

Bottom line: the calendar and the clock
are a strange mix of astronomy, math, histo-
ry and mythology,‘ but it looks like we’re as
stuck with them as we are with Microsoft
Windows. ‘Ifit’s any consolation, we all start
our own personal time zero the day we’re
born. I suspect we all, consciously or not, use
other, warmer, fuzzier points and units to
structure and measure our days and lives: the
heartbeat, the sigh of relief, the red light, the
between-meal snack, the end of ﬁnals, the
ﬁrst time...

Well, no matter where I start: counting it I p
or how I slice it up, my time is running out. .

I’d better get back to looking for what the
Chinese call “shunjian yu yongheng” — the
moment and the eternal. ‘

Anyway, ‘ Happy New Year again!
Here’s another chance to break our
resolutions.

High schoolers capable of making healthy decisions

fere with people’s rights —- rights such as the freedom to
make lifestyle choices —— unless those choices interfere
with someone else’s rights. ‘

If Satcher wants to battle national obesity, he should
encourage the positive choices people already make.
Plenty of high school students choose to be active, yet
many athletic programs remain grossly underﬁmded. By
increasing federal support to positive programs that work,
we could make physical activity a more viable option for
students. ~

To change the national attitude toward health food and

exercise, we should put more eﬂ"ort into elementary school
health programs. Children can be taught the beneﬁts of
healthy choices while their habits are still controlled by
their parents. In middle and high school, kids’ choices are
determined more by what is convenient than by a lack of
knowledge.

Though many students are at least somewhat health
conscious, cafeterias and vending machines rarely oﬂ’er
healthy alternatives. Faced with a choice of hunger or
Twinkies, teenagers naturally go for what’s available. If
better food were offered as an option’— not as a substitute
— many students might seize the opportunity to eat
more wisely. . ‘

Vendors should offer better snacks, like pretzels and
juice, for the same price as a Coke and candy bar. When a
can of 1 soda comes at half the cost of a bottle of water, stu-
dents will "generally go for the cheaper option.

We should improve the options available to kids, but
the choice must. remain theirs. Though it would be nice if
all high school students suddenly got the urge to exercise
and eat well, Satcher must recognize their choice to play
video games and pig out on doughnuts instead.

‘Selwyn sets Pitt recordwith triple double

KEVIN NASH
Staff Writer

A historic moment took place at Fitzgerald Field

House on Saturday afternoon when junior guard Laine «

Selwyn recorded the ﬁrst triple double in Pitt history dur-
ing Pitt’s 77-45 win over St. John’s Red Storm. Selwyn
scored 12 points along with 10 assists and 11 rebounds.

“I wasn’t really aware of it until the end of the game,”

' Selwyn said. ‘.‘VV1th, like, ﬁve minutes left they told me that

I need two assists and two rebounds. I kind of just played
and it happened.”

Selwyn’s accomplishment came with 3 minutes and
30 seconds left as she was credited with an assist on junior
guard Brooke Stewart’s three-pointer.

“That was a huge accomplishment. It was the ﬁrst time
in school history,” said Pitt head coach Traci Waites. “I
think that is deﬁnitely something that should be "discussed.
It was a good thing for her.”

The win snapped a seven game losing streak for Pitt,
which had dropped its record to 1-9 in the Big East VV1th
this victory the Panthers improve to 7-15 overall and 2-9 in
conference play. A

“I’m just happy that we won,” Waites said. “I’m real-
lyexcited for our athletes. I think at this point we had lost
seven in a row and to come out and play as hard as we did,
I’m really excited for them.”

The Panthers dominated the first half as they began the
game with a 7-2 lead but St. John’s showed signs of life as
they cut Pitt’s lead to 9-6. Yet the Panthers overmatched the
Red Storm early and often as they proceeded to go on an 8-
0 run.

Pitt ﬁnished the ﬁrst halfon a 26-10 run in the ﬁnal ten
minutes of the half. Both Stewart and freshmen guard
Haley Harguth hit two three pointers during the stretch.

Harguth ﬁnished the game as Pitt’s leading scorer with
20 points that included ﬁve three—pointers. Stewart fol-
lowed Harguth’s performance and senior forward Bettina
Love with 16 and 12 points respectively. Love also con-
tributed seven rebounds with ﬁve coming off of the defen-
sive glass. ‘

The Panther defense played_well throughout the after-
noon, as it held the Red Storm to just 16 ﬁrst half points.
The defense constantly swarmed around the ball and
deﬂected passes. St. John’s ball handlers were always
under pressure because Pitt consistently applied double-
teams.

Pitt forced 17 turnovers in the ﬁrst half, which led to
18 points. Its defense also came up with six steals.

Selwyn led the Panthers in steals with three followed
by Stewart, sophomore center Dallas Williams, and fresh-
man guard Amy Kunich who had two apiece.

“We just ran the game plan,” Selwyn said. “We came
out really strong. I think that we were really prepared. We

« were trapping and we knew that they had one speciﬁc ball

handler, so we really exploited their weakness.”

The Red Storm took better care of the ball in the sec-
ond half as they only turned the ball over six times. -

“Every screen on the ball we trapped [in the ﬁrst halﬂ,”
Waites said. “In the second half you noticed there were no
screens on the ball, so we couldn’t trap.”_- 0

The Panthers scored 15 fast break points on the after- \

noon and outrebounded the Red Storm 41-33.

“That was one of the things that they did not do well
was go to the boards. They didn’t have that many second
opportunities,” Waites said. "That gave us an opportunity
to" go to the boards and just look to run.” "

‘They do something odd; they don’t line up anyone on
the free throw line,” Selwyn said. “We basically boxed out.
I think we just played really hand. We just did the things that
we had to do,” Waitessaid. »

7 Thanks to a large lead throughout the game that
increased to as much as 28 points at one time, the Panthers
appeared to be more relaxed and played with more conﬁ-
dence than usual.

“I think we press a lot in trying to win and wanting to
win and I think they knew that they were going to,” Waites
said. “I don’t think we were any different than we have
been other than the fact that we were overly conﬁdent”

The tearn’s next game is'atV1llanova on Feb. 13. Tip-
oif is set for 7:30 p.m. .

Howland forced to work with depleted, seﬁsh roster

Rebuilding, page 11

Grgtuich, who I know real well, used to be the coach here,
so I knew a lot about Pitt. I knew what a great tradition it
had, and that the Big East is as good as it gets.”

Pederson sat down with Howland and his family at a '

restaurant in Flagstaff, and Howland “was just as good as
I anticipated he would be. He met or exceeded all my
expectations.” .

Pederson was sold.

Ben Howland was hired as men’s basketball coach at
Pittin April of 1999, and the long, arduous task of retum-
ing the team to respectability began.

“We won 20 games three years in a row [at NAU],

Howland said. “I took them to the NCAA tournament for _

the ﬁrst time ever andto the NIT, so I was ready for a new
challenge.”
And a challenge he would get.

The Introduction

Most fans got their ﬁrst look at Howland and the team
at Midnight Madness that year. It was the ﬁrst time the
event had been held at Pitt in years, and the fans came -to
Fitzgerald Field House in droves.

There were dunk contests and shooting contests.
Everything looked good, but underneath, the team was
still a mess.

“The ﬁrst thing was to get the guys I had in the pro-
gram headed in the right direction, because there was a lit-
tle bit of chaos at that time,” Howland said.

‘The "main thing was setting up the whole system of
what we were gonna do. I think the attitude when I ﬁrst
arrived was a lot of selﬁshness in terms of guys worrying
more about stats instead of W’s and learning how to play
as a team.”

Isaac Hawkins had to sit out the year because of a leg
injury, but Howland had Ricardo Greer, a perennial All-
Big East selection, to build around. Brandin Knight, Jaron
Brown, Chad Johnson and Donatas Zavackas, players

Pitt head coach Ben Howland has had three seasons to
groom the likes of Brandin Knight and J aron Brown.

recruited by Willard, were still on board, so the nucleus
was set for years to come. T

The Season -

There isn’t a particular moment from that ﬁrst season‘
with Howland at the helm that sticks out in Pederson’s
mind; neither the Midnight‘ Madness nor the big win over
Notre Dame. P ..

What he remembers instead is how he changed
everyone’s attitude about the team pretty quickly, even if
he had to do it the hard way.

“I told coach Howland when we ﬁrst talked about the

job that I want this program cleaned up,” Pederson said. '

“I want to win. I want to win the right way with the right

kind of people. I said I don’t care ifwe end the season "

playing ﬁve walk-on players.
' “What coach Howland did his ﬁrst season all the way
through was make long-term decisions for the program.”
One of those decisions included Kellii Taylor, a play-

 

er who as a freshman led the nation in steals but who also
ran into trouble oﬁ” the court while he was at Pitt.

During the long haul of the season, a player of
Taylor’s caliber could have easily helped Pitt win a few

’ more games, but Howland had no other choice than to

kick him off the squad. ,

. “A lot of the time we only had seven guys on schol-
arship,” Howland said. “Isaac got hurt, and I had to kick a
couple guys off the team for disciplinary reasons. I didn’t
want to waste scholarships just bringing in anybody, so it
was a tough ﬁrst year.” ,. i ,

As a result, the team suﬁered. Pitt lost its ﬁrst ﬁve Big
East games and won.only ﬁve conference games all sea-

son. The Panthers lost to Vrllanova in the ﬁrst round of the '

Big East Tournament and ﬁnished 13-15, a win of the
pace of the season before.

Despite all the distractions, injuries and losses, the
team showed some signs of the good things to come.
Notre Dame saw it ﬁrsthand when it came to the Field
House on Feb. 6, 2000 and lost 72-66.  '

“That was a big win for us, because they had a very
good team,” Howland said of the Fighting ‘Irish, who were
led by future NBA player Troy Murphy at the time.

' “We had a tough start [that year]. This is a tough
league, and it takes time to build. .

“We didn’t have depth, and we had a team with som
lirnitations. Donatas and Brandin got a lot of experience
that year, since they were thrustinto the situation right
away. And even though they didn’t play in the games,
Jaron and Chad were here, so having those four guys in
the three years that I’ve been here makes a huge differ-
ence. ‘ ' A
“Our guys played real hard. That was the bottom
line.”

By the end of his ﬁrst season at Pitt, Howland did not

yet have a team that resembled _a winner, but at least he

had something that resembled a team.

Pitt handed first league  

lossof the season

Despite the loss, Stottlemyer praised his
grappler’s effort. “Jimmy Thornton did an
excellent job,” he said. “He wrestled his
heart out.” . ,

Pitt got back on the board at 133
pounds. Panther Shawn Amistade was in
control throughout, and came away with a 4
0 win over Chris Spealler, making the score
19-6. ‘

In the ﬁnal two matches, Lock Haven’s

pounds, No. 9-ranked Mike Maney coasted
to an 8-0 victory over Pitt’s Blaise Mucci.
In the ﬁnal bout of the night, No. 3-
ranked JaMarr Billman had his way with
Pitt’s Justin Giovinco and sailed to a 12-4

win.

The loss was tough to take for the
Panthers, who headed into the match feeling
good about their chances against the higher
ranked team. “I’d be lying 'ifI said I wasn’t
disappointed,” Stottlemyer said.

Amistade echoed his coach’s senti-

ments. “It’s just disappointing,” he said,‘

“coming out and only winning two out of 10
matches.”

Stottlemyer pointed to mental mistakes
as the team’s downfall. “I just don’t think we
wrestled very smart tonight,” he said. But
Amistade was quick to give the Bald Eagles
credit. “Lock Haven wrestled their asses
off,” he said. ‘”That’s all you can say.”

Philly isn’t Kobe’s hometown

Paul, page 11

Why wasn’t Yuri -Demetrius on the
bench?

I know he’s 280 pounds, but could
Toree Morris be any slower? ‘

Do you believe that I’ve ﬁt the word
‘vagina’ into my column ﬁve times?

_All week long, the nation’s papers
made a big deal that Kobe Bryant was
returning to Philadelphia. It was trumped
up as Kobe’s homecoming and throughout
the week, ‘the questions revolved around
what kind of reaction he would receive.

Kobe had been booed before in

, Philadelphiaand everybody knew that it

was going to happen again. The Philly
fans had been stirred up all week ‘and
rightly so. '

An all-star game is always a special
time for its host city and its participating
players..Allen Iverson, _the league’s reign-

‘ing MVP, and Dikembe Mutombo, the

league’s reigning defensive player of the
year, were selected to play and this should
have been the city’s and their event to
share and enjoy. .

And its not like Cuttino Mobley,
Rasheed Wallace or Eddie Grifﬁn, players

' that are actually from the city, were getting

the hype. Kobe is from Lower Merion, not
Philadelphia. It’s nearby but it’s not the
city. This was never to be his day to shine
and the Philly fans made sure of that. ,
He’s never endearedhimself to the
city. Bryant is now a native of Los
Angeles. If he came back to the
Philadelphia area during the off-season,
that would be one thing but he doesn’t.
Bryant won the NBA championship

_ in Philadelphia, but he did it as a Laker
 and Philadelphians have never been fond

of the purple and gold.

I don’t look at the booing barrage 

another black eye on Philly. The papers
are always looking to blast the Phillyfans.
When the Cleveland Browns’ fans threw
bottles on the ﬁeld, Philly’s name was

I constantly brought up for no apparent rea-

son. . .

Kobe has never been a Philly boy and
he got what he deserved for claiming that
he was.

Philly is a loyal town, once you’ve
proven yourself and show that you display
the blue-collar workmanship that is
expected. Iverson is Philly. He’s a warrior
that ﬁghts every night and plays through
serious injuries. Kobe is a great player but
he will never be endeared by Philadelphia.

The media set Kobe and the city of
Philadelphia up and the fact that the pic-
ture is being painted that Kobe was deeply
hurt and that the fans are vicious is -a

pathetic notion.
