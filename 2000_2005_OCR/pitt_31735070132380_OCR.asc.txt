PATRIOT Act inspires discussion of civil liberties

ANASTASIA STERANKO
1 Staff Writer

Two librarians sit down for a cup of tea. The first
one asks the other, “How do you know‘ if the FBI has
been in yourlibrary?” The second librarian answers,
quaintly, setting down her tea cup.

“You can’t.” _

Librarian jokes like this one mixed with more
serious concerns at a free Civil Liberties forum held at
the Rodef Shalom congregation in Oakland last
Tuesday night. A

Before the passage of the USAPATRIOT Act on
Oct. 1, 2001, librarians and the American public did
not worry about whether conﬁdential library records
would be shared with law enforcement agencies.

Now, concerned citizens like Vic Walczak, the I

legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union
Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, are wondering how and
when the government gets access to that information.

Civil liberties concerns emerging after Sept. 11,
2001, were addressed by a panel of experts from the
FBI, media, ﬁeld of law and American Library
Association at Tuesday’s forum, which was sponsored
by The League of Women Voters of Greater Pittsburgh
and the Allegheny County Library Association.

Most of the 157 sections contained in the PATRI-
OT Act cover uncontroversial topics,_such as provid-
ing financial assistance to victims of terror and
increasing the beneﬁts of safety workers.

But a few parts of the act —— like Section 412,

which allows the government to detain aliens indeﬁ-

nitely — exposed conﬂicting views on the panel.
“There is no reason to hold people in solitary con-

ﬁnement over an expired visa,” said Jules Lobel, pro-
fessor of law at Pitt’s School of Law.

Lobel disagreed with other members of the panel
about the number of people detained as a result of the
PATRIOT Act. _

Section 412 is not the only see-

Act necessary to protect the lives of Americans, argu-
ing that the power to access library documents pre-
vents the use of public libraries to commit the acts of
terror.

about civil liberties. Sections 214
and 215 extend the govemmen_t’s

Some librarians are concerned about
the conclusions. the government
might draw from such information.

“Just because a person checks
out a book or explores a Web site
does not mean he or she agrees with the opinions
expressed,” Cynthia Richey, director of the Mt.
Lebanon Public Library and president of the
Association for Service to Children, said.

“He really put in a lot of heart

how Shepherd would stop what he
was doing if somebody needed his
help. _

iron, play a role in biology and the
function of biological systems.

“We’re going to miss him a lot,”
Pratt said, adding that he would
remember Shepherd for his enthusi-
asm and his “genuine spirit.”

Shepherd is survived by a sister,
who arrived in Pittsburgh from
North Carolina Thursday morning.

will be held on Monday, Sept. 29, at

Bioengineering has little to do
with Bouquet brownie baking

Insanity ensues, screams of
“She’s ironing! She’s ironing!” and
loud laughter, mostly Moira’s, can
be heard throughout the halls as
girls fall into pieces over Simpson’s
inability to open ‘her garage doors.

Let’s remember, though, that
roommate Jessica couldn’t figure
out how to open the downstairs door
from her bedroom. ,

“How does this thing work?”
Jessica says ,through the speaker

outside.
Maybe she should have her own
reality, TV show. Wait a minute...
As the show ends, and the girls
begin to see the bottom of the fon-
due pot, out come Molly’s custom-
made Twix brownies, still hot, on
which Kelly, one of the Bouquet
Gardens regulars, burns herself.
“We thought you were smart,”
Moira says. “You’re a bioengineer!”
“That has nothing to do with
eating brownies,” Kelly replies.
Really?

The Real Pitt: Bouquet Gardens will follow two groups of stu-

dents living in Bouquet Gardens throughout the fall semester. The

articles will appear in The Pitt News every Friday, and will alternate
between stories in an apartment of girls and an apartment of guys.

PA should redefine common law marriage

' Bad news for unconventional rela-
tionships — yesterday, a Pennsylvania
appeals court abolished common law
marriage. That is, marriage in which
both parties consider themselves spous-
es, but never obtained a legal marriage.

The court accepted John Kretz’s
claim that he should receive the pension
beneﬁts of his common law wife, Janet
Stamos, after her 1994 death.

But it then struck down the institu-
tion of common law marriage in
Pennsylvania,‘ saying that the designa-
tion was vague and confusing — which
could lead to fraud frompeople wanting
to proﬁt off another’s death — accord-
ing to a Sept. 18 Associated Press arti-
cle. ' .

It also included a grandfather clause
in the decision, meaning that current
common law marriages will be.protect-
ed legally, while future common law
marriages will receive no legal protec-
tion. ‘

In Pennsylvania,‘ common law mar-

riage applies only to couples living

together for a signiﬁcant amount of
time, who treat one another as spouses
and intend to marry. Given this vague-
ness, deﬁning when a common law mar-
riage began —— upon dating, cohabita-
tion or private vows — becomes difﬁ—
cult. _- q

The court’s role is to strike down
laws that it ﬁnds wanting. In this case, if
it found the law wanting, it is now up to

legislative bodies to reassess the laws
and determine how to clarify them.

Resultantly, the Pennsylvania
Legislature should draft a new, clearer
deﬁnition of what a common law mar-
riage is, and of the status of those in one.
Doing so would give the court a clear
guideline as to how to parcel out bene-
ﬁts and give people like Kretz and
Stamos a ﬁnancial safety net if their
partner dies. _ .

Common law marriage gave the
rights of legal marriage to people who
are not technically married — rights that
can include insurance coverage, tax
deductions and, in the case brought
before the court, a widower receiving
his —— common law — wife’s pension
beneﬁts. * -

Marriage, is a messy business.
Whether it’s treated as state or religious
institution, it engenders the issue of
what a married couple is. For instance,
is the union of two people of the same
gender less a marriage than that of a het-
erosexual couple married on an acciden-
tal night in Las Vegas?

And are two people who exchange
private vows, as Kretz and Stamos did,
but not officially married, deserving of
the same rights as people who schlepped
to the Justice of the Peace?

This court seems to think that
Pennsylvania requires a better litmus
test than currently exists, which the leg-
islature needs to provide. .

less sensitivé and more loath to cry than
most of the guys I’ve dated. I began drinking
black coffee when I was eight, after my par-

and stick to the habit. l’ve had just enough
hangovers that I should know I can’t keep

I’m sure my behavior is
really the manifestation of an

to life when I’m around other
girls. I remember realizing in

I realize most guys -do

    Focus: Ashcroftand the USA PATRIOT Act

    Justice Department showing no
regard for laws it should uphold

U.S. should reexamine
motives behind prosecutions  

Last June, in California, a man,
while sitting in his car, accidentally deto-
nated the homemade pipe bomb that he
had resting on his lap. He was arrested
and charged with “terrorism using a
weapon of mass destruction,” according
to a press release from the Los Angeles
Division of the FBI. t

On a‘ similar note,
Attorney General John
Ashcroft has just ﬁnished a
13—city, whirlwind tour, on
which he embarked in an
effort to squelch rumors that
law enforcement ofﬁcers
were using the newfound
powers granted them in the
USA PATRIOT Act too lib-T
erally.

Ashcroft, echoing senti-
ments Bush has repeatedly emphasized,
assured people that the law-abiding pub-
lic had nothing to worry about, that the
measures are meant only for bad guys,
and that all warrants require a court to
sign off on them.

I wonder if this unfortunate
Californian man — who knows what can
be injured when a pipe bomb explodes in
your lap —— is one of the 255 people who,
Ashcroft brags, have had criminal
charges brought against them using the
PATRIOT Act.

Or if, after the provisions of the act
labeled him a terrorist, he was subject to
one of the‘ 18,000 subpoenas and search
warrants issued under the act. I

Wait a second. That can’t be right —
18,000 subpoenas and search warrants
‘have led to only 255 criminal charges --
'a 71-1 ratio?

Not very impressive, but don’t
worry, Bush and Ashcroft have an
answer. That pesky “get a judge to
approve subpoenas” measure is their
stumbling block, and they want to elirni—
nate it.

At least, that’s what I imagine their
thought process to be, considering
Bush’s recent push to allow administra-
tive subpoenas to be issued in terrorism
cases. An administrative subpoena does-
n’t require a judge’s approval. Even more

interesting is that, when you receive one, .

you’re prohibited from telling anyone
except your lawyer.

“We don’t want to tie the hands of
prosecutors behind their backs,” Justice
Department spokesman Mark Corallo
told The New York Times.

' Now, I think a decent argument can
be made to prove that yes, tying prosecu-
tors’ hands is exactly what the law is for.
And that, when the law cannot hinder its

executors, they will, in turn, be able to
execute any law in any manner that they
see ﬁt, and without accountability to any-
one. But hey, that whole judicial branch,
checks-and-balances thing was going out

of style anyway. Administrative subpoe-
-nas are already available in 300 kinds of

investigations, such as health
care fraud and child sex

sorts of investigations pri-
marily end up in civil court.

Allowing such power as
a means to criminal proceed-
ings, is licensing judicial cir-
cumvention, by allowing it
access to a realm in which it
has no business being.

And combined with the
simultaneous effort, pro-
posed by Bush in a speech last Saturday,
to make it nearly impossible for people
suspected of being terrorists to get bail,
the result is that prosecutors can effec-
tively assume the role of judge and jury
in cases involving terrorism. _

Even Arlen Specter, who is sponsor-
ing legislation to expand the death penal-
ty to numerous terrorism—related charges,
thinks this is too much. He told The New

.York Times, “The Justice Department

has gone too far. You have to have a rea-
son to detain.”

\Perhaps, if the ‘world was a very dif-
ferent place and, therefore, our govem-
ment’s rhetoric was consistent with that

‘world, all this could be justiﬁed. If ter-

rorism was defined lirnitedly, still only as
embassy bombings and planes ﬂying into
buildings, then sure, allow certain extra
freedoms to law enforcement ofﬁcers.

But that just isn’t the way things are.
“Terrorism” has become a tainted and
elusive term more often used abstractly
by our leaders, to scare us into an obedi-
ent trance, than it is to describe a materi-
al threat. _ g

In courtrooms all around the country,
the terrorists we’re ﬁghting, with billions
upon billions of dollars, are revealed as
fools from California. And their weapons
of mass destruction are discovered as
amateur pipe bombs unable, even, to kill
the terrorists who make them.

VV1th' results like these, it’s no won-
der that the Justice Department, in its
effort to enforce thelaw more often, is
seeking to move further and further away
from the judiciary, the body created to
remind them what that law is supposed to
be.

Now is unquestionably a contempla-
tive, if not sorrowful, time of the year for
the United States. Just over two years ago,
a handful of terrorists plunged the nation
_into grief, perpetrating what is unequivo-

. cally one of the most important events of

modern time. Indeed, it’s clear that many of
its most profound ramiﬁca-
tions are, as yet, unrealized.

Understandably, the
American public ached for
strong leadership after this
traumatic event. The great '
American self-conﬁdence was
sorely shaken.

Engel’s ‘Communist Manifesto’ out from

Now, Ashcroft’s once-bipartisan sup-
port base has deeply eroded on both ends

. _ of the political spectrum. In
July, the House passed an
amendment, 309-118, to cut
funding for a part of the
PATRIOT Act allowing for

' Act II was leaked to the pub-
lic, even staunch conserva-

what could even remotely be
considered an act of war‘? We

A needed someone to assure us that this

would not go unnoticed, that we were not
nearly as vulnerable as we felt.

And regardless of what you may think’

of him, George W. stepped up to the chal-
lenge. Addressing us with the requisite
amount of outraged stoicism, he not only
comforted us, but also promised revenge,
declaring war on that politically—loaded,
ever—changing word: terrorism. Our ques-
tions had been answered. We looked rever-
ently, and with misty eyes, upon our new-
found father/defender, President George
W. Bush. --

But we couldn’t realistically hope for
this war to be over soon, which left us feel-
ing just as insecure, wondering constantly
whether tomorrow or the next day would
‘bring the ﬂaming apocalypse of nuclear

terrorism. Someone had to terror-proof the

nation, even while Congress bickered ‘over
the creation of the Department of
Homeland Security.

Someone? Well, John Ashcroft, of
course.

Taking advantage of a shell-shocked
legislature and nation, Ashcroft champi-
oned his pet project, the USA PATRIOT
Act, as if it would be the ultimate savior of
the nation. Fear not, dear Americans! By‘
adopting the tried—and-true tenets of ’ histo-
ry’s greatest police states, invading your
privacy and curtailing your civil liberties, I
will make our nation safer!

Yea, and it came to pass that Ashcroft’s
answer to America’s security problems, the
PATRIOT. Act, passed with exceptional
bipartisan support. And it was good.

That is, it was good until people actu-
ally started thinking about what they had
signed into being. Gradually, people came
to realize that they didn’t like the idea of the
Department of Justice constantly reading

'— over their shoulders.

tives like Bill O’Reilly were
appalled.

In response to this growing lack of
enthusiasm for his most beloved of poli-
cies, Ashcroft has taken to the roadto con-
vince the masses, or, more precisely, small
groups of invited lawmakers and police-
men, of its necessity.

Last Tuesday, just two days before the
event that spawned the now-waning sup-
port for his invasive policies, Ashcroft ﬁn-
ished up the tour in New York, addressing
the ﬁnal group of politely clapping, but
markedly unenthusiastic law enforcement
professionals. .

Obviously on the defensive, Ashcroft
implied in his speech that - those who
oppose the PATRIOT Act had forgotten
what it was like when New York was “hal-
lowed by the blood of innocents.” After

concluding his speech with an appeal to the .
“Providence which has bestowed upon '

America the ability to lead the world in lib-
erty,” Ashcroft endured several long
moments of awkward silence until one hes-
itant audienceimember stood and led the
audience in a smattering of polite applause.

Hopefully, the irony is not lost on us
that Ashcroft believes we “lead the world
in liberty” through inhibiting the very lib-
erties that make our country what it is. For
my part, Ashcroft dishonors those irmo-
cents whose blood hallowed New York, in
whose name he picks apart the ideological
foundation of the country in. which they
died.

Perhaps it’s time to realize that we
should start thinking for ourselves again.
Perhaps we should reconsider the unwa-

vering support we offered our father/pro- -

tector George W. Bush, and the cormsel he
keeps.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 7

Last Friday, a friend sent me an e—mail with a subject

1 line that read “A Sad Day for Cheese.” I didn’t need to open

it to know that the likely subject of the e-mail was the pass-
ing of John Ritter,‘ and I toyed with the idea of not opening
it — I don’t need to read any jokes about the death of a
funny person — and just deleting it. But my curiosity got the
best of me, and there it was, an e-mail poking fun at Ritter
— “Ritter is now in cheesy comedian heaven” was one of
the jokes. .

Asad day for cheese? Cheesy comic heaven? It was
rough. C L

Earlier on Friday, while I was still in my just-woke—up
stupor, I heard the words “John Ritter and Johnny Cash
died.” That was enough ‘to shake me awake.
I’m an unapologetic John Ritter fan, thank you very

It was upsetting that Johrmy Cash passed away 4— his

\ death marks a great loss for both the music world and soci-
\ - ety at large. But hearing about Ritter dying was more shock-

ing. He was relatively young -— only 55 when he collapsed
on the set of his TV show “8 Simple Rules for Dating My
Teenage Daughter,” before dying, at the hospital, of an aor-
tal dissection — and he was enjoying a resurgence in popu-
laritythanks to the show. Johnny Cash, on the other hand,
had been beating off death for the better part of a decade,
while being consistently successful since the ‘60s.

What made the death of Ritter all the more tough was
how genuinely talented, as both a comic and an actor, he
was. Those people who called him “cheesy” couldn’t see
past his work on ‘“Ihree’s Company” and the poor spin-off
‘Three’s a Crowd.” But he was more than Jack Tripper. .

That’s not to say his work on “Three’stCompany” was

bad. His style of
physical comedy
was one that tele-
vision had rarely
seen, and his abil-
ity to pull it off so
well makes up, in
a way, for the
“Three’s a
Crowd” debacle.

Ha programs that’s a

cultural relic of
ﬂue ‘70s and did-
n’t age well on
. A the whole.

I didn’t ﬁnd an appreciation for John Ritter from
“'Ihree’s Company.” It was a little before my time, despite
the show running into the ‘80s. However, I caught enough
of the reruns to appreciate Ritter’s comic ability and acting,
not just on the show, but in ﬁlms like “Stay Timed” -— a ﬁlm
about a guy who gets sucked into Hell via a-huge satellite in
his backyard and has to last 48 hours dodging — literally -
killer TV programs or have his soul stolen; it’s a movie in

which he performs one of the best moments of self-parody

ever. .

The moment of self-parody comes late in the ﬁlm,
when Ritter is going through the numerous channels on the
network — via the TV remote control, which works inside
the TV —- looking for his wife, who erroneously got sucked

. just one of those ’

Don’t say cheese if there’s no picture

into the satellite, as well. Every show on the network is a
parody of a real show or movie —- for example, there’s
“Dwayne’s Underworld” and “Driving Over Miss Daisy”
— and one of the shows Ritter lands in is a ‘j'Ihree’s
Company” riff.

Dwked out in a Hawaiian shirt and white pants, Ritter,
upon entering the program, trips over the living room couch
and looks around, dumbfounded. Right then, the theme
song for “Three’s Company” kicks in, and two women, one
blonde and one dark-haired, open the ﬁont door and

exclaim, “Where have you been?” Ritter screams loudly

and quickly changes the channel, leaving the program.

It’s a hilarious scene that allows Ritter to not only poke
ftm at himself, but also deal with the hell of having “Three’s
Company” hanging over his head — he’s a “cheesy comic”
because of the show.

' Only a comic genius could make a scene like that work
+ and Ritter nailed it.

More impressive, though, is how Ritter succeeded later
in his career in less ‘comedic roles in ﬁlms like “Sling Blade”
and “Tadpole.” He didn’t have the burden of having to be
funny to get in ﬂue way of acting —-— he could concentrate on
the craft rather than the next pratfall. In “Tadpole,” espe-
cially, Ritter showed off his acting chops, holding more than
his own alongside the likes of Sigourney Weaver and Bebe
Neuwirth — not bad for a cheesy comic.

Give Ritter credit He took all of that “cheesy actor”
criticism in stride, even making fun of himself at times, and
went out and continued to do what he loved, undeterred.
And he was enjoying more success than ever at the time of
his death, which might be the most unfortunate‘ loss of all:
the John Ritter projects that now will never be.

Big city to small town

. Cold Creek Manor

Starring Dennis Quaid, Sharon
Stone, Stephen Dorff, Juliette
Lewis

Directed by Mike Figgis ’

AMANDA S. WALTZ
Staff Writer

Cooper Tilson (Dennis Quaid) is
caught between his career as a ﬁlmmak-
er and the stress of his everyday life. But
when his son is nearly plowed over by
an SUV, he and his wife Leah (Sharon
Stone) decide it’s time to trade in the
demands of . their New York City
lifestyles for the safety and simplicity of
a small town. So goes the beginning of
“Cold Creek Manor,” a mediocre thriller
directed , by Mike _ Figgis, the
writer/director behind the Academy
Award-winning “Leaving Las Vegas.”

Evenbefore the opening credits, the

. ﬁlm paints a picture of the Tilson family _
as beingbombarded by the chaos of big- .

city life, so much, in fact, that in what
seems like an instant, they sell their
house and head for the small town of
Bellingham, New York. While in search
of a new home, they stumble upon the
abandoned Cold Creek Manor. Although
the history of the dilapidated estate is
shrouded in mystery, the Tilsons and
their two children immediately move in
and begin renovations. ..
Everything is going smoothly until

’ Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff of “Blade”

fame) forces himself into their lives.

‘Claiming to be the one—time owner of

Cold Creek, Massie offers to help
restore the house while he‘ recovers from
the loss of his family and unexplained

time in jail. Feeling sorryfor Massie’s ‘

bad luck, Cooper Tilson agrees to let
himstay, a decision that leads to disas-
trous consequences for Cooper and his
family. _

The mystery behind Cold Creek
Manor and Massie is hardly that. The
film is thick with foreshadowing and

leads its audience through a mess of
clues thatexplain Massie’s -past and the .

disappearance
of his family.
By the time the
Tilsons realize
what devilish
deeds have been
committed in
their house, the
a u d i e n c e
already knows.

Massie is — 
also overplayed
by Dorff as a
psychotic drifter
obviously out‘
for » revenge.
Since his performance lacks any sense
of subtlety, it leaves no question that
Massie is responsible for whatever mis-
deeds happen in the ﬁlm, diminishing
what little suspense the ﬁhncould have
had. Combine these two elements, and
one has the recipe for a very predictable
ﬁlm. ‘

However, one upside to “Manor” is
its effective cinematography. Figgis sug-
gests a sense of paranoia throughout the

ﬁlm by placing the camera at voyeuristic
angles over the tops of dressers, the tops
of cars and by ﬁlming through door-
ways. By using these methods, it seems
as if the Tilsons are constantly being

intruded upon in their own home, giving -

the ﬁlm an uncomfortable atmosphere.
If you -can ignore the tired plot,

laughable acting and ambiguous, cop- 

ou/t ending, “Manor” can be enjoyed for
its few stylistic accomplishments.

A young boy helps two old men over-
come their cranky attitudes and realize
that there are still things that make them

want to stick around. It’s not the most orig- .

inal plot line. Kids have been changing the
lives of adults throughout cinema history,
usually when they are dumped‘ at the

doorstep of a distant relative or even a T

stranger. “Secondhand Lions” uses this
formula and adds a little twist. ’

Instead of being just one story about
how young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is
sent to live with his crazy, rich uncles Hub
(Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael
Caine), the movie is split into three stories.

The first story features the older
Walter (Josh Lucas) reﬂecting on the tur-
bulent summer he spent with his great-

‘ uncles. The second story is a ﬂashback

about that summer, which is the bulk of

the movie. The .third story focuses. on  .

 

Great Uncle Hub’s past + tales ﬁlled with
sword ﬁghts, dangers, beautiful women
and lots of gold.

For a family movie, it has a lot of guns
and violence. Uncle Hub and Uncle Grant
sit on the porch and wait for door-to—door
salesmen to come by so they can shoot at

them and watch them scramble for safety.
The uncles also get into a scuffle with a
few teenage boys. When the movie goes
back in time to tell the story of Uncle Hub,
his sword goes into quite a few people.
However, there is never any blood and if
anyone gets explicitly hurt, it’s" because

they deserved it. The violence isn’t scary;
it’s meant to be comical. _ L
The mystery behind Walter’s uncles’

fortune is the driving force of the plot. J

Everyone knows that the two old men

’ have millions stashed away and each has a

different theory on how they obtained it.
Walter’s mother gives him explicit
instructions to find the stashed cash. Even

with all of this excitement, the movie

drags in some places, leaving the audience
restless and bored. Partsthat were sup-
posed to induce tension fall short because
they are predictable. T
Despite the lulls, there were qui a
few cute, funny moments. The pack of
dogs following: Walter around is a nice
touch. Walter’s relationship with the lion
that his uncles bought adds plenty of
humor. The best moments in the movie are
not forced; they simply highlight the
growing warm relationship between
Walter and his uncles. ; -
As an interesting, funny, exciting fam-
ily movie, “Secondhand Lions” tries, but it

doesn’t always deliver the amusement it’s -

striving for. However, the moviehas good

moments and the best intentions. For -

ing “Secondhand Lionsi’ is not a bad way

Dance production remembers important American history

taken form via note—taking and joumaling.
Michele de la Rcza and Peter Kope,
dancers and co-founders of Attack Theater,
reﬂect on the impact of the notebook.
Alongside, Mikuni Yanaihara of Nibroll
shares, from a non-westem perspective, the

' moments and memories that are associated

with time, be it the present, past or future.

According to de la Reza, “In creating
this piece, many questions arose for us,
questions that relate to how we cope with
the experience of devastating, life-altering
moments. Is the notebook the only place
where memories stay present or do these
memories fade away ?”

“No—to” delves into memories and
examines how time alters them, depicting

not only the devastating events of Sept. 11,
2001, but also other pivotal moments in his-
tory such as World War II. This production
uncovers shocking beauty in each instance
and period of time.

“No—to” is not linear but can be consid-
ered a narrative piece, inviting audience
members into the production, and onto the
stage, to make their own interpretations and
to open doors to reﬂective space. It has
been said by some that this production has
“brought "hope for the future.”

Both the Pittsburgh—based Attack
Theater and Tokyo-based Nibroll have per-
formed internationally and been considered
innovative groups. Both companies intro-
duce new styles of dance and interpretation,

welcome conversation and critique, and
open themselves to cultural exchange.

Both Friday evening performances
will have a post-show “talk back” session
where the audience will have the opportu—
nity to discuss themes, ask questions and
share visions and interpretations with
Attack Theater and Nibroll.

This is an international, multifaceted

performance, with masterful dancers. The

costume design is done in neutral colors
with khaki and cargo fashioned attire. The
movements are ﬂexible, energetic, mechan-
ic and moving. Overall, this production is a
versatile experience, broadening the minds
of viewers and offering a time and place for
meditation and discussion.

Panthers ready for first road game

RYAN FALOON
‘ Staff Writer

Pitt’s football team faces a
major challenge this weeke_nd as it
travels to Toledo (2-1) Saturday for
its first road game of the season. ‘S

The Panthers (2-0) must stop
the brilliant air attack of the
Rockets, led by quarterback Bruce
Gradkowski, a sophomore sensation
who has made an immediate impact
on the Toledo offense in his first
year as a starter. , “

Gradkowski, a Pittsburgh native
from Seton LaSalle High School,
poses a threat to the Panther
defense. In his first three collegiate
starts, he has thrown seven touch-

down passes with no interceptions,
averaging 173 passing yards per
game.

“He’s a real good athlete,” Pitt
head coach Walt Harris said. “He
can make some things happen when
there.’s nothingthere.”

The remarkable passing -attack
of Gradkowski may also be credited
to his offensive line. Averaging just
less than 316 lbs. per starter, the
offensive line of Toledo is the

On the opposite side of the ball,
the Rockets are just as intimidating.

Marshall, the Toledo defense creat-
ed five turnovers, forcing three
fumbles and two interceptions.

Senior cornerback Brandon

Hefﬂin, a four-year starter, leads.

the Rockets defensively. Already
with two interceptions this season,
Hefflin is in fourth place on
Toledo’s all—time interception list
with 13.

As a unit, the Toledo defense
has both depth and experience. It

includes nine seniors, six of which

are starters.

Neither the offense nor the

defense of the Rockets appears to
be something that the Panthers want
to overlook. Both sides of the ball
present great challenges that Pitt
must overcome.

team,” Harris said. “We know that it
is going to be a tremendous chal-
lenge for our football team.”

, In addition to playing perhaps
its most Worthy opponent thus far
this season, Pitt faces the challenge
of making its first road trip of the
year. Harris, thoughyfeels that his
team is up for the test, ,

“We like to play on the road,”
he said. “We welcome those chal—
lenges. Our guys like to play and
they like challenges. We’re looking
forward to playirig.” ‘

The Panthers face many chal— .

lenges this week and will be expect-
ed to live up to the recent media
atteniion they have received.

Over the past week, Pitt has
moved up in the rankings to the
ninth spot in the Associated Press
poll. Additionally, senior quarter-
back Rod Rutherford was named the
Big East Conference’s Offensive

Player of the Week after his perfor- ,

mance against Ball State.
Rutherford, an All—America

candidate, has appeared to perform

ﬂawlessly thus far this season. ~

However, to get past the Toledo
defense, Harris feels a need for
improvement out of his quarter-
back. 1-

‘‘He’s got along way to go yet,”
Harris said.“ “The fortunate thing
about him is he’s got. enough talent ’
to keep traveling thatﬂroad.”

If Rutherford can produce the
same statistics as he has done in the
first two weeks, the Panthers will
have no problem. To do so this

week, however, he will need to step

it up a notch and takeover with his
offense.

A _ As a team, the entire ‘Panther S
squad must be well -prepared and

‘ Going away for the first time as

“It’s going to be a test for us,”
Pitt senior cornerback Shawntae

Game against Cincinnati not as easy as it looks

The Steelers travel to Cincinnati -this Sunday to
take on the Bengals.

This is a statement that annually causes great joy
and hearty celebration in the pubs and streets of the
Steel City. But for those of you Steelers fans who have
already scribbled a “W”« next to this game on your
pocket schedules, you may want to start shaking the
White-Out.

These aren’t the same old Bungles.

Sure, they are 0-2, to nobody’s surprise. And yeah,
they still wear those hideous black and orange jerseys.
But new head coach Marvin Lewis has made his pres-
ence felt immediately on ._the defensive side of the ball,
as the Bengals have shut down two gun-slinging quar-
terbacks in the first two games of the season. And the
Bengals’ offense, which has been on the verge of
explosiveness over the last two seasons, finally seems
to be clicking on all cylinders.

Against Denver in the first week of the season, the
Bengals picked off Jake Plummer three times, and held

him to only 115 yards passing in his Broncos debut. \
Clinton Portis ran wild for the Broncos, and it’s obvi— '

ous that Denver won that game in spite of its passing
offense, not because of it.

And just to prove that their performance against
the Broncos was no ﬂuke, the Bengals’ defensive back-

ﬁeld proceeded to shut down the Oakland Raiders’ '

vaunted passing attack on the road in week two.

Cincinnati held last year’s Most Valuable Player
Rich Gannonlto just 103 passing yards and no touch-
downs through the air, as the defending American
Football Conference champs were visibly frustrated by
Cincinnati’s stingy defensive schemes and refusal to
give up a big play.

Like it or not, the 2003 Steelers, much like the
2002 Raiders, have a big-play offense. Pittsburgh ranks

Unlike the Broncos, however, the
‘Portis who can carry the load

. falters. The Steelers currently rank

first in the AFC in passing offense
and first in total offense after two
weeks, and has shown an afﬁnity
for airing it out early and often.

 

Steelers don’t have a Clinton
offensively if the passing, game

fourteenth in the AFC in rushing,

and continuous failure to establish the run early could

cause some serious matchup problems for Pittsburgh

against the Bengals. ’ 0
On the offensive side of the ball, the Bengals ﬁnal-

ly seem to have some weapons at all of their skill posi-

tions. Chad Johnson is a legitimate deep threat for the
Bengals. His 154 yards receiving against the Steelers
last season at Heinz Field is surely something that
Dewayne Washington and Chad Scott won’t forget
when they line up against him this weekend. -Peter
Warrick showed ﬂashes of brilliance last week in his
l09—yard receiving day against the Raiders, and his
weekly development could provide a speedy compli-
ment to J ohnson’s skillful route running.

Corey Dillon doesn’t hit the hole as quickly as he
once did, and he is coming off of an injury suffered
against the Raiders. But his 118 yards on the ground
and one touchdown .score are plenty impressive con-
sidering his limited action,‘ and Brandon Bennett pro-
vides a more—than—capable second option at running
back. ‘ ‘ .

And then there’s quarterback Jon Kitna.

Kitna has ﬂat-out owned the Steelers the last two
seasons. He has executed former Steelers assistant Bob
Bratowski’s dink—and—dump offense to perfection
against Pittsburgh’s confused defensive backs and over

  

pursuing linebackers, and his biggest
games of each season come against
Pittsburgh.

Many forget that in 2001,
when the Steelers went 13-3 and
reached the AFC Championship
game, one of their losses came late in
the season against the Bengals. Kitna
certainly doesn’t, as he hada career
day in front of a home crowd, throw-
ing for 411 yards and two touchdowns in the Bengals’
shocking upset. victory. What’s even more impressive
is that Kitna found nine different receivers in the game,
refusing to lock in on his first or second options.

Kitna picked up where he left off in 2001 against
the Steelers at Heinz Field last year. His 290—yard, one
touchdown pass performance was efficient enough to
almost bring the Bengals back from sure defeat, but not
explosive enough to seal the victory. And Kitna does-
n’t seem to be showing any signs of rust this season, as
he threw for over 300 yards against one of the best sec-
ondaries in the NFL last week in Oakland.

The Steelers are traditionally slow starters under
Bill Cowher, and they’ve yet to establish an identity
this season. Against Baltimore,’ their passing game
looked unstoppable, their run defense impenetrable,
and their secondary just as bad as ever, committing
dumb interference penalties against a rookie quarter-
back. Against Kansas City, Pittsburgh’s passing game
looked suspect, especially within the redzone.
Meanwhile, the Steelers’ secondary was solid, and their
run defense was as thin as spaghetti against Priest
Holmes and the hogs up front for the Chiefs. In fact,
the only constants for the Steelers through two regular

Toledo (3-2, 1-0 Mid-American
Conference) scored the game’s first
points on the first drive of the sec-
ond quarter when Rockets quarter-
back Brian Jones hooked up with
wide receiver.Carl Ford for a 44-
yard touchdown. Kicker Jason
Robbins missed the point after and
Toledo’s lead stayed at 6-0.

Ford finished the day with eight
catches for 103 yards.

Though Jones completed 14
passes for 154 yards in the first
half, the Pitt defense recovered two
fumbles and held Toledo to 31 rush-

ing yards on 15 carries before the '

break.

Despite leading the defense
with 12.5 tackles, cornerback Torrie
Cox said there were several things
the defense could have done better.

“We had a lot of missed tack-
les,” Cox said. “We just have to go
back and practice a little harder.”

Linebacker Gerald Hayes and

safety Tez Morris had seven and 10

tackles, respectively in the win.

When the Panthers (4-1, 1-0 Big "

quarter, their offense came alive.

A 15-yard completion to run-
ning back Raymond Kirkley set up
an 18-yard touchdown pass from
Rutherford to receiver Lamar Slade,
and the Panthers took a 7-6 lead.
Slade caught four balls on the day
for a total of 45 yards.

Two drives later, Pitt was facing
a third-and-five on its own 34-yard

‘line when Rutherford threw a 65-

yard strike to Fitzgerald who was
tackled at the 1-yard line. Kirkley
ran the ball into the end zone on the
next play and the Panthers went up,
14-6.

. On the following drive, Hayes
jarred the ball loose from receiver
Donta Greene’s hands and tackle
Dan Stephens picked it up to regain
possession» for the Panthers on the
Toledo 26-yard line. ‘

With 2:49 left in the half,
Rutherford engineered an eight-

11-yard pass to tailback Marcus

Combine this identity crisis with

touchdown pass to Fitzgerald.

“We came out focused, we
watched a lot of tape, we knew a lot
of play- action would get them,”
Rutherford said. “We just had to
execute well, which I think we did
today.”

In the second half, the Rockets
came out throwing. Jones complet-
ed passes to Manny Johnson and
Chris Holmes for gains of 13 and 15
yards respectively. Toledo drove 59
yards on 10 playsto the Panther 18-
yard line before an interception by
linebacker Brian Beinecke.

The Pitt offense took over and
marched 85 yards in just under
seven minutes on a scoring drive
that included a 39-yard pass to tight
end Kris Wilson. Rutherford fin-
ished off the drive with an 8-yard
touchdown run. Wilson caught two
passes for a-~total of 56 yards in the

Abdul also misfired on field goals
of 34‘and 23 yards, but was good on
a 37-yard attempt with 13 seconds
left in the game.

_ Down 27-6 going into the fourth
quarter, Toledo’s offense began to
show signs of life. Jones completed
22- and 13-yard passes to Greene,
and "tailback Quinton Broussard
threw a 25-yard pass off a ﬂea-
ﬂicker to tight end Greg Grothous.
Tailback William Bratton then
scored on a 4-yard run. Robbins
again missed the point after and
Pitt’s lead stood at 27-12.

Jones finished 31 of 45 for 306
yards, two touchdowns and an
interception. He also ran for 32
yards.

’ When the Panthers got the ball
back, tailback Brandon‘ Miree’s 39-
yard scamper set up a 26-yard
touchdown pass to Fitzgerald.

Miree finished with 48 yards on
six carries. to lead Pitt’s rushing

attack. Fullback Lousaka Polite

     

added 36 yards on 10 carries as the
Panther offense rushed for 153 total
yards. ‘

“We’ve definitely got to get the
running game going,” Rutherford
said. “That’s our focus from here on
out.”

Though the Rockets would
mount another touchdo_wn drive, it
would ' not be enough and the.
Panthers held_on to collect the vic-

The win was the Panthers’..third
in a row and keeps them a perfect

“These are the type of games,
that we need to get out of the way to

can’t wait for next week,” Cox said.
“We have a great team and when we
