ct. fatality prompts renewed

emphasis on pedestrian safety

ast month’s pedestrian
fatality near campus
as prompted renewed
attention to pedestrian safety in
Oakland. At the urging of Faculty
Assembly, the University Senate
community relations committee
will tackle the issue.

A pedestrian was struck and
killed Oct. 14 by a construction
vehicle at the intersection of
Fifth Avenue, Darragh Street
and McKee Place, near the con-
struction site of Pitt’s Biomedical
Science Tower 3 (BST3). See Oct.
23 University Times.

“But that’s certainly not the
only dangerous place for acci-

-dents or potential accidents,”

said Tracy Soska, chair of the
community relations committee,
at a meeting Nov. 10. “We have
the area in front of Hillman and
on Bigelow and Fifth and Forbes
avenues and their side streets.
And there are larger issues here.
I know we’re an urban campus.
But we’re also linked with the sur-
rounding community, and safety
issues extend to the community.
There are issues of enforcement:
What jurisdiction do the Univer-
sity police have for trafﬁc viola-
tions, for example. We need to
look at whether the problems are

city—related, community—related,

or University-speciﬁc.”

There are some things Pitt can
do, he said. As an example, Soska
noted that a campus police vehicle

_ is regularly stationed during rush

hour at Roberto Clemente Drive
and Pennant Place. Regional
public transportation issues,
including ameliorating traffic
congestion in Oakland, also
should be considered, he said.
Committee member Ken
Batista added, “Part of the
problem is also the mindset of
the pedestrians, not just [aggres-
sive or reckless] drivers. We ’ve all
seen people just walk out into an
intersection without looking. Is
the. ordinance against jay—walk-
ing ever enforced? It may be that
some of the answers are simple:
education of pedestrians and
enforcement of existing laws.”

The committee plans to invite
members of Oakland community
groups for feedback on pedestrian
safety problems. “A lot of these
groups —- the Oakland Task
Force, Oakland Planning and
Development Corp., Oakland
Trafﬁc Management Associa-
tion — over the years have done
studies on trafﬁcflow and trafﬁc
signage,” Soska said. “We should
get an update from them on their
latest data, as well as consult with
city planning and [Pitt police]
Chief Tim Delaney.”

The Staff Association Council
(SAC) has been looking at pedes-

trian safety for several months.

James Lyle, who chairs the SAC"

safety and security committee,
told the UniversityiTimes Nov.
12 that his committee met with

Chief Delaney to discuss a wide —

range of concerns on campus.
“Right now, we have not arrived
at particular recommendations
for the campus. But we plan to
work with the University police‘
and the community relations
committee to [investigate] what
can be done,” Lyle said.

Last month Lyle forwarded a
set of photographs of pedestrian
"trouble spots campus-wide to the

city’s Department ofEngineering

and Construction, which over-
sees trafﬁc issues and evaluates
dangerous conditions. -
According to Fred Reginella,
director of that city department,

trafﬁc qengineersmevaluate com-_.

plaints as ﬂ:“éy"“¢c5rhe’ia "to his
ofﬁce. “We have the expertise

but we don’t always have _the

resources in manpower,” Regi-

nella said. “We do investigate

complaints, typically with an
on—site visit, and we apply state

and federal standards [of safety] ,”

he said. Complaints are queued as

they come in, unless they appear
to represent an imminent threat
to safety.

Reginella said that the city
requires a trafﬁc study to deter-
mine if a controlled device is
warranted, such as a new traffic.
light or an exclusive walk phase,
which allows pedestrians a grace
period, typically 25-30 seconds,
to cross an intersection while all
trafﬁc lights stay red. a

Such a study, ordered by
the city, was completed last
week by Trans Associates trafﬁc
engineers for the intersection of
Fifth Avenue, Darragh Street
and McKee Place, the site of last
month’s fatality. Staging for the
BST3 construction at that inter-
section has forced the temporary
elimination of the sidewalk, the
bus stop and the northernmost
inbound lane on Fifth Avenue

between Lothrop and Darragh

streets, squeezing four lanes of
trafﬁc on Fifth into three. The
construction project also relo-
cated the pedestrian crosswalk
to the west side of Darragh/
McKee (running between the
Rangos Research Center and
the Kaufmann Medical Build-
ing), from its pre—construction
location on the east side (from
Hieber’s Pharmacy.to the east
side of Darragh). This shift forces
pedestrians to cross trafﬁc turn-
ing left from McKee and right
from Darragh onto Fifth.

The Trans Associates study
measured the impact on traffic of
installing an exclusive walk phase
at that intersection, according to
city trafﬁc engineer Darryl Phil-
lips. Some 40,000—5 0,000 cars use
the inbound Fifth Avenue corri-
dor on an average weekday.

As a result of the study, the
c’-ity-has decided against install-
ing an exclusive walk phase at the
intersection.

“There would be a very
substantial negative effect on
trafﬁc congestion of adding an
exclusive walk phase, not only
at thathintersection but on the

adjoining streets,” Phillips told “
the University Times this week.

The city had already okayed
a 5 —second “advanced pedestrian
phase,” which gives pedestrians
a head start into the intersection
before trafﬁc lights turn green.

-Reginella also approved a “no.

turn on red” sign for traffic
coming down Darragh toward
Fifth. Both of these changes will
remain in place, Phillips said.

_ In addition, Mascaro Con-
struction Co., the contractor
for Pitt’s BST3 project, hired
off—duty police officers to assist
pedestrians and direct trafﬁc at
the intersection weekdays from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

“We feel, based on our own
observations as well as the traf-
ﬁc study, which evaluated the
current trafﬁc ﬂow, thathaving
the police officer stationed at the
intersection for the duration“ of
the construction project is pro-
viding the safety for pedestrians
and‘ the efﬁcient trafﬁc ﬂow as

close to the ideal as you can get,”
Phillips said. “The police ofﬁcer
is holding. trafﬁc until pedestri-
ans can get completely across
the street, and controlling over-
aggressive drivers and, frankly,
over-aggressive pedestrians, who
start crossing too late.”

He added that the city will
continue to monitor the situation
and will re-evaluate it if any new
problems arise.

Reginella said, “We’ve not had
any complaints since the police

' ofﬁcer ﬁrst started there. My only

concern is that to keep a police
presence there from 6 a.m.- to
10 p.m. will cost [Mascaro] a lot
of money.” BST3 construction

is expected to continue until

2005.
SAC’s Lyle ‘agreed that the

police officer had effectively,

restored safety to the intersec-
tion. '

In my department, as I am sure
in many other departments, we
have a group of superb and highly
dedicated undergraduate teach-
ers. They repeatedly demonstrate
extraordinary skills at helping o11r
students to reach their full poten-
tial. If this were not the case, how

could we explain Pitt’s unmatched
success with Marshall fellow-
ships? Even though the quality
of our incoming students keeps
rising (they know we are doing
things right) it would be illusory

. to claim that Pitt systematically

attracts the very best students
in the nation. I/Vhence, short
of being an unlikely statistical
fluke, Pitt’s success with Mar-
shall fellowships owes equally to
our faculty. I am obviously very
proud of Cynthia’s success but I
am equally proud of my faculty. It

To the editor: .
The University’s Planning
and Budgeting System (PBS)
has been in operation for over 10
years. The system is designed to
offer faculty and staff the oppor-
tunity to participate in the process
through the planningand~budget-.
ing committees (PBCS) of their
units. The Senate budget poli-
cies ’ committee (SBPC) wishes

to call attention to the collegial _

and participatoryintention of the
PBS process. The PBS document
(available at www.pitt.edu/~jdl1/
PBSdoc.htrn) explicitly states,
“Planning and budgeting deci-
sions are legitimate only if they
are both based on full informa-
tion and arrived at through an
open, formal process.” Under the
PBS our committee “is respon-
sible for reviewing whether the
PBS procedures are followed
and whether all constituencies
involved are provided. adequate

opportunities to participate in the

process and to be informed of its

outcomes.”

The Senate budget’ poli-

cies committee is available to_

help in PBS implementation
and to provide information.
We are particularly interested
in hearing from any faculty or
‘staff members who are ‘aware

of anylinstances where the PBS 1

process is not being carried

NOVEMBER 20, 2003

Applications up here despite  
tuition hike for new students  

he news that Pitt’s Oak-

land campus will hike its

base tuition by $1,000
next fall for new in-state, full-time
‘undergraduates doesn’t seem, to
be discouraging high school
seniors from applying here.

As ofNoV. 7, some 9,3 3 5 pro-
spective new students had applied
to enroll at Oakland next fall.
That’s up from the 7,5 21 students
who had applied here at the same
point last year, said Betsy Porter,
director of Pitt’s Admissions and

A Financial. Aid ofﬂce.

The Oakland campus is on a
pace to receive a record 22,000
applications for next fall, up

from last ‘year’s best—ever total —
A of 17,494, she said. See chart at

bottom of page.
 Pitt announced last month ——

    

more than 10 months in advance
— that, beginning in fall 2004,
newstudents here will pay higher
tuition than continuing students.
Differential tuition plans already
are in place at Penn State, Ohio
State and the ‘University of Illi-
nois, among other schools.
.“The timing of our announce-

told the University Senate’s

budget policies committee
(SBPC) last week. Pitt’s new

“tuition system “won’t come as

any surprise to prospective new

students and their families,” she
said.

The announcement of Pitt’s
differential tuition plan followed
tuition hikes of 9.5 percent this

‘fall and 13.9 percent in fall 2002

for Pitt in-state undergraduates.

Nonetheless, the University is
not pricing itself out of reach
for qua-lified Pennsylvanians

- from lower—income households,

Porter said in reply to an SBPC

member’s question. '-
Many such students would

qualify for annual, maximum

. grants of $4,000 from the fed-
ment was pretty good,” Porter «

eral government’s Pell grants
program and $3,300 from the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA)
program, she said. “That’s $7,300
before the University provides
any assistance at all,” and Pitt
has been increasing its ﬁnancial
aid budget annually. ‘
But Pitt is becoming
increasingly, less affordable for

out—of—state students from less—'

than—afﬂuent households she

 

As these charts indicate,
Pitts remains a bargain for
Pennsylvanians, at least com-
pared with the nine schools
that Pitt now sees as its major
competitors in recruiting
students. Pitt’s out-of-state
tuition ($18,586) also is less
than in-state tuition at three
non-Pennsylvaniavuniversities
on the list: Boston’ University

_($28,906), George Washing-

ton ($_29,3 50) and New York
University ($28,495). But Pitt
can be a tough sell forstudents
from Delaware, Maryland and
Nlichigan, where tuition at the

‘ state university is less thanhalf ,

 

allowed. Non—Pennsylvanians
don’t qualify for grants or loans
from PHEAAand few other states
provide substantial aid for study
here. “Pitt can provide some help,
but there are only so many grant
sources to go to,” Porter said. ,
Currently, Oakland campus
tuition is $8,614 per year for

.full—time, in-state undergradu-

ates in the arts and sciences. For
out-of-state A&S undergrads,
tuition rose by 7.5 percent this
fall to $17,926..
I CI

The academic qualiﬁcations
of Oakland campus freshmen,
as measured by. SAT scores and
percentages of students who
graduated in the top 10 percent
of their high school classes, have
risen steadily since fall 1995.

Among current freshmen,
Porter said, 43 percent graduated
in the top.10'percent of their high
school classes (up from 19 percent
eight years ago) and the average,
combined ‘SAT score was 1213

-(up from 1110 in fall ’95).

Competitors

“What we say to prospective
students is, ‘Ifyour SAT score falls
within the 1140—to-1300 range
you’re in pretty good shape for
being accepted [at the Oakland

campus] assuming that your

, academic performance in high

school was pretty solid.”
To be a lead~pipe cinch for

acceptance here, an applicant '

would need to have scored
at least 1300 on the SAT and
graduated in the top 10 percent
of his or her high school class
— “although, there are even
some qualiﬁcations with that,”
Porter said. “For example, the

School of Engineering would ‘

be looking for speciﬁc grades in
a student’s high school math and
sciences courses.”

The ratio of in— and out—of-
state students hasn’t changed
much at the Oakland campus in
the last eight years: In fall 1995 ,
19 percent of freshmen here were
non-Pennsylvanians. This fall, it’s
21 percent. ‘

From serendipity to living
the American Dream:
Guy Nicoletti ‘

When the Greensburg
campus opened its doors to stu-
dents in fall 1963, Guy Nicoletti,
who is still teaching at UPG 40
years later, was there — all due

. to pure chance.

Months earlier, Nicoletti
(then a Pitt graduate student in

mathematics) had been walking ’

in Greensburg when he saw to his
surprise a “University of Pitts-
burgh” sign at 122 N. Maple
Ave, Curious, he entered the

“old bui1‘diﬁ'g,'1atef to be ‘named

Vogel Hall, UPG’s ﬁrst home. Its
wooden steps creaked, and paint-
ers were sprucing the place up.

“I guess I made some squeak-
ing noises,” Nicoletti remem—-
bered, because out of one of the
ofﬁces on the second ﬂoor came
Carl Poke, then "assistant to the
president for academic affairs,
and still on the UPG political
science faculty. Poke asked, “Can
I help you?”

The two got to talking
and Nicoletti, matter of factly,
reviewed his background in math
and engineering and his experi-
ence working for U.S. companies
in South America.

Suddenly, Poke told Nicoletti,
“Don’t go anywhere!” and left to
confer with UPG’s ﬁrst presi-
dent, Albert B. Smith. Nicoletti
recalled: “Later I met Dr. Smith
and he said, ‘Well, we’re starting
here in the fall, would you like to
join the faculty? We’d like you
to teach math, engineering and
Spanish.’ I guess he ﬁgured he had
three birds in one hand.” ‘

Not that Nicoletti was unique
for his versatility among the origi-
nal faculty, he said. “We had a
make—believe campus, but a real
multi-dimensional faculty. Most
of the original 12 of us‘ could per-
form the work of two or three
specialists.” .

’ VVith his first child on the way
and a Ph.D. still to complete,
Nicoletti wondered if he could
handle the teaching load, “but
this was one of those moments
in time where you say to yourself,
‘I have to start somewhere.”’

To bolster his nerve, Nicoletti
determined to take it one year
at a time at UPG. But one year
followed 1 another, he was pro-

moted and earned tenure, and
the dynamic teacher (winner of
the campus’s 2001 distinguished
service award), now 75 ,-is still
going strong. A

Nicoletti cited UPG’s
creation of academic villages
— where students meet for

non—classroom academic activi- .

ties centered around broad areas
such as the humanities and behav-
ioral sciences — as having had the
most profound effect on campus
education.

Regardless of era, Nicoletti

said, students are basically the

same, with the same drives,

aspirations, weaknesses and
strengths. “But the students of
yesterdaywere motivated bywell—
deﬁned objectives, whether they
were economic, political or social.

They knew who they were and
where. they wanted to go, and
there were thriving industries,

especially in this area: Westing-
house, General Electric, AT&T,

Bell Labs.

“In my ‘opinion things
changed with the Vietnam
tragedy; old values crumbled,
purposes became fuzzy, we had
uncertainties in all our thoughts,
and that includes faculty.”

Vietnam and its consequent
upheaval continues to affect the
social fabric down to this day, he
said. “We’re still struggling for a
sense of direction. It’s as though

“students are blindfolded and
the horse pulling the carriage is
blindfolded, too.”

But Nicoletti has no regrets

that his “one year at a time” ‘

became 40, with the promise
of more. i

Stanley Katzman ’
Humble beginnings for UPG
would be an overstatement, said
chemistry professor Stanley
Katzman, who came to UPG in
1967. Chem labsinahigh school,
which meant moving equipment
back and forth from storage and
keeping everything under lock
and key; a commencement_held
in a local hotel ballroom; make-

an inferiority complex. A
“We could hardly claim. we
were providing quality lab expe-
rience for students in those days,
butwe made do with whatwe had,
and I think those early students
really put in outstanding efforts
to learn,” Katzman said.

' “We didn’t have any new
buildings of our own until
Powers Hall and Smith Hall”
opened in the mid 1970s, which

at least quelled any rumors that i

the campus might be closing, he
said. “I think once we started con-
struction, we began to feel like a

real campus, but it wasn’t until the ‘

opening of the Millstein Library

that we could really call ourselves A

a fully realized college.”
Katzman said the 1995 dedica-

tion of the Nlillstein Library was

;; ,.',—'.-.=,‘<-l'..- ,»-:2» 7 -

;g_....

the campus’s proudest moment.

1 The 1993 library ground-break-

ing also marked the beginning of
his time as the unofﬁcial campus
photographer.

The late Guy Rossetti, who
served for 29 years as professor
of Hispanic languages and litera-
tures and later as. vice president

for administrative affairs at.

Greensburg, saw Katzman taking
pictures one day. They started
talking about how no one had.
been documenting the develop-
ment of the campus. Rossetti told
Katzman: -“That’s ridiculous. We
need to have an archive of that. I
want you to start taking pictures
of everything you can.” , ,
Now the Ofﬁce of Student
Life is always using Katzman to
shoot events. “It’s been a great
way to get to know the students on
more or less a calendarcyclez the
sports teams, the annual events
and so on,” Katzman said. “And
individual students will justcome

‘ up to me and say, ‘Can you take

my picture in front of this build-
ing? I want to send it home to my
parents or boyfriend.’”

Rossetti also should get the
most credit for the [campus’s
expansion, Katzman said. The
Rossetti House for International
Studies, part of the academic vil-
lages model, was named in his
memory in 1999. 

“It really was his master plan,
that he had to sell to the Univer-
sity, to the community and to the
state, that you see [the fruits of]
today. Now when parents come
to visit or high school students
lookin.g at colleges, their jaws
drop, it’s so beautiful.

“For the longest time even our
own community, literally, didn’t

1-

.  ,~.'.‘- ., ;-,.

know we existed,” Katzman said.
“I had a student tell me he used to
go by here twice a day the whole
time he went to Mt. Pleasant
High School, but never knew
we were here. Then the high
school sponsored college night,
and once he saw the campus, he
said he was ﬂabbergasted.”

Campus expansion also
promoted higher enrollment
and a better quality of students,
Katzman said. “Especially with
the academic villages, we’ve been
making a concerted effort to make
our students more cosmopolitan.
You couldn’t really do that when
we were mostly a commuter
school. And our relationship to
the community right now i_s the
best it’s ever been.”

Has the relationship of the
campus to Pitt’s central adminis-
tration changed over the years?

“I’ve never really concerned
myself with that,” Katzman said.
“I think of myself as ‘a grub in the
pits, and that’s not a complaint.

' Teaching my students is what this

place is all about for me.”

Award-winning staff member
and campus quilter:

Dolly Biskup started work
at UPG in 1980, when George
Chambers was named campus
president. “I’ve been in Lynch
Hall ever since,” she said.

VVhile -Biskup has stayed
anchored, -the campus has not:

Be’c"a”iﬁ-‘E
most of the 27 buildings on the
213 acres have sprung up while
she’s been working there.

“I also came here before com-

puters, ” Biskup said. “We had the

old AB’ Dick machine with punch
cards to keep our records. Things
have sure changed.”

But one constant, she said,
“is the slow pace around here.

You’re deﬁnitely not in a city '

when you’re on our campus.”

» ' "Biskup’s institutional memory
includes a winter day in the
1980s when Slate Creek froze.

“Overnightit rained, and I 

swear there wasa huge iceberg

on the sidewalk when we came .

into work. I.-felt likeyou had to
be a mountain climber to get into

-the building.”

She also recalled the now-‘
defunct Polar Club that would
raft on the creek in freezing
weather dressed only in swim
trunks, which made staff ques-
tion the rafters’ sanity. .

While she hasn’t encountered
any ghosts herself, Biskup said
some people on campus believe

"Lynch Hall and the Rossetti

House are haunted. “I know one
staff member who swears she saw
the ghost of Commander Lynch,

A and I’ve heard students talk about

strange noises in Rossetti House,
which originally was the home of
Mrs. Quinn.”

Every once in a while, students '
will bring a psychic to campus to
attempt contact with the polter- 1

second of three quilts depicting
campus history. The ﬁrst quilt,
“UPG Beginnings” and its fol-
lowup, “Building UPG,” now
hang in the Millstein Library.

Her volunteer efforts and pro-
fessional service to the campus
have earned her both the UPG
President’s Award for Staff
Excellence and the Chancellor’s
Distinguished Service Award for
Staff Employees.

“I just enjoy my job, and I
really love this place,” she said.

Changes for staff:
Joyce Bucchi

Even though she’s been at .

UPG for “only” 15 years, Joyce
Bucchi, director of Human
Resources, has seen signiﬁcant
changes. _

“I remember quite clearly
when I came here in 1987,
there were severe budgetary
constraints. We were counting
every pen, pencil and piece of
paper, and ordering» any of our
supplies needed to be approved,”
Bucchi said. “Now-we’ve been

. able to expand drastically with

new technology. I think staff
would appreciate what they

have more. today if they were

around then.”

Bucchi said there were 3 7 staff
in 1987, a number that since has
grown to 120. “In the past staff
had to wear four or ﬁve differ-
ent hats. They still do multiple
things, but they are not quite as
diverse in their responsibility.

“On the other hand,” she
continued, “today’s staff are
much more involved in campus

. and  activ.-iti,e.s=  in

United :“way,-  the smart
Growth Partnership, which has
its headquarters on campus, in
all sorts of charitable functions

like the Heart Walk. Our ‘staff .

are not just 9—to—5ers.”
She said that another change

during her tenureas director

of Human Resources has been ’

closer ties with the Pittsburgh
campus counterpart HR ofﬁce.

“They really makes us feel like
we’re part of the University; it’s
been verypositive.—An HR liaison
holds the beneﬁts fair with us.
They’ve offered our staff coun-
seling. It’s been a real change for
the better,” she said. ,

“Allin all this is a great place
to work,” said Bucchi, who was
honored with the 1998 UPG
President’s Award for Excel-

lence in Service and the 2002

UPG President’s Award for Staff
Excellence. —

A commitment to teaching:
Donald Reilly

The clock is winding down
on the teaching career of English
professor Donald Reilly, who is
retiringnext monthafter 3 8 years
at Greensburg. ._ V I

“It will be different for me
after « all this time, but that’s
okay,” said Reilly, whose teaching
honors include the 1997 Sigma
Tau Delta Honor Society award
and the 1999 UPG Distinguished
Teaching Award. He intends to
volunteer at the Nlillstein Library
and serve on campus committees
as needed.

Reilly “has held many posts -

since coming to Pitt-Greens-
burg in 1965, while ﬁnishing his
doctoral work at the Pittsburgh

campus. He served two six—year ‘

stints as chair of the humani-
ties division, and for a time was
the campus’s public relations
ofﬁcer. V

Reilly came to Pitt—Greens-
burg for ﬁnancial reasons, after
two years teaching at Bethany
College. “I came because of the
tuition beneﬁt while I was com-
pleting graduate school.

“Dr. Smith came to me and
said, ‘I want you to stay and grow
with this institution.’ I thought
to myself, ‘VVhere else could I
have’ such an opportunity?’ It
was agreat decision, I’ve been
very fortunate and I’ve never
looked back. I also appreciated
the campus-wide commitment
to high-quality teaching.” ~

Reilly said the camaraderie
among the original faculty, who
for the most part were similar in
age and who shared the enthu-
siasm born of starting a new
college, contributed to a sense
of community, even absent a
campus. _

And grow the institution did,
Reilly said, and not just building
by building. “I thinkwe’ve grown
in many ways: the number of stu-
dents, more diverse students, and
having students live on campus.
Higher SAT scores. More activi-

are more engaged in the com-
munity life of the campus.

(He was quick to defend
UPG’s earlier students, however.
“Students in the late ’60s and early
’70s were very hardworking and
really appreciative of their edu-
cation,” he said. “And since they
were commuters, they had to
commit more of their time, and

they often had jobs and families
to manage.’’)

The most important growth
in the campus, though, was the
gradual transition, to becoming
a four-year institution. “I give
all the credit for that transition
to Norman Scanlon, who was a
faculty person’s dream dean. .He

was an advocate for us, while still '

being no-nonsense.” .

The advent- of four-year
programs can be attributed to
Scanlon’s efforts as vice president,
Reillyosaid. “Or, at least, let’s say
he was a key player behind the
scenes,”in wrenching approvals
from Pitt’s administration and
the commonwealth, and lobby-
ing the Greensburg community
for ﬁnancial support.

“VVhen we were a two-year
institution and students knew
they had to go to Oakland for
the second two years, they usually
considered this campus as their

 

home. Our alumni are incredibly
loyal, and we’ve had constant sup-
port from the Greensburg com-
munity, and those are signs of a
healthy institution.”

As he faces retirement,
Reilly, who favors,19th-century
American writers, said he thinks
of Ralph Waldo Emerson ’s “Con-
cord Hymn” because his ofﬁce
in the Faculty Ofﬁce Building
overlooks a green bank by the
Slate Creek:

“On this green bank, by this soﬁ‘.

Behind the scenes:
Norman Scanlon

Long—time administrator,
sometimepoliticalsciende teacher
and even erstwhile interim presi-
dent are positions that reﬂect the
central role of Norman Scanlon
in the Greensburg campus’s insti-

. tutional history, earning him the

2 000 UPG President’s Medal for
Distinguished Service. .
Scanlon, who started in 1968
as assistant vice president to Carl
Poke (President Albert Smith’s
ﬁrst hire in 1962), succeeded

 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Poke in 1991 as vice president
for academic affairs. VVhile down-
playing his inﬂuence, Scanlon
acknowledges his part in build-
ing the campus faculty.

“Going to four-year pro-
grams particularly helped with
building and strengthening
our faculty,” he said. “We’re a
teaching campus, of course, but
we also have many examples of
quite respectable scholarship,
and that’s something we’re very
proud of.”

Greensburg campus faculty
have won 11 Chancellor’s Dis-
tinguished Teaching Awards.

But the process of building
four-year programs was some-
times disheartening because
of the slow pace, he said. “We
picked up steam when we moved
to our permanent home on the
Lynch estate, because it gave us
breathing room to expand.”

That expansion, coupled
with converting to a primarily
resident-student population of
mainly full-time students — just
the opposite of the campus’s orig-
inal make—up of mostly part-time
commuters -— helped build the
institution into a high-quality
small liberal arts college, which
todayis considered among West-
moreland County’s best.

i “It wasn’t until the 1980s that
we saw a 50-50 split of full-time
and part-time students. Now
that students are predominantly
full-time, student activities
have blossomed: intercollegiate
athletics have developed, the
academic villages have arrived,
there’s a much stronger sense of
community.”

That sense extends beyond

the campus, Scanlon said.
“Due to the efforts of President

‘’ ‘[Fra" 1‘ nrk” ]— Casé:eH,1%“»for  

are a founding member of West-
moreland Heritage,” a county-
wide organization dedicated to
raising public appreciation of
the historical assets of Westmo-
reland County and encouraging
tourism.

Does the sense of community
extend to Pittsburgh and Pitt’s
central administration?

“Truthfully, past adminis-
trations treatedus with benign
neglect. I think that started to
change when Don Henderson
was provost and now it’s as
strong as it’s ever been with
Provost Maher and Chancellor
Nordenberg, who were just on
campus in September helping us
celebrate our 40th anniversary.

“Our goals are generally in
line with those of the Univer-
sity: a focus on undergraduate
education, on increasing- the
quality of the student body, ‘and
on creating stronger new inter-
faces by integrating student and
residential life.”

But Scanlon feels nostalgia
for the early years, too. “I think
there was a sense of community,
even in the early years. Dr. Smith
was a great one for family-style
picnics,” he said.

Some of those picnics were
held on the campus’s Kenneth

. E. Bell Nature Trail, which was

dedicated in 1975.

“I remember we had to cancel
our picnic one day, when Don
Reilly was giving instructions
on how to use a machete to
clear brush on the trail and he
hit ‘himself in the leg. So, '1. guess
he was a trail-blazer in more ways
than one,” Scanlon quipped.

SAC wants more professional
development programs for staff

he Staff Association

Council (SAC) is push-

ing professional devel-
opment programs for staff.

“We all know it’s important,
no matter what your job is, to
look into programs that will help
your career, whether they are HR
(Human Resources) workshops
or College of General Studies
certificate programs or com-
puter quick—start classes,” said
Ann‘ Ostroski, who chairs the
newly formed SAC research
and information committee. “We
have many options at Pitt, but I’m

   

looking for input for new train-
ing seminars for career advance-
ment. What kind of workshops
and training would you like to see
available? VVhat kind of skills do
you need to develop?” she asked
at the Nov. 12 SAC meeting.

Ostroski is polling staff, asso-
ciate deans, directors and others
from the ﬁve Pitt campuses for
input. She said the committee
expects to develop proposals for
new training seminars over the
next few months.

and March 20, 2003 meetings were approved. Maher
discussed the general issues surrounding the FY 2004
planning and budgeting process. He distributed a draft
annual report to the chancellor for review and comment
by the committee members.

Discussion of F Y 2004
planning and budgeting parameters

Ramicone discussed the time 1 inc of the planning and

budgeting parameters process and background information
on the FY 2004 parameters. He then distributed the report
of the parameters subcommittee, including the following
major recommendations.

' A tuition increase of9.5% for in—state students
and 7.5% for out-of-state students;

6

° The assumption that the commonwealth
appropriation will decrease 5%;

' A projected 10% increase in grants and
contracts revenue;

° No change in gifts, endowment, and
investment revenues;

° A 3% increase in salary expenditures;

' No increase in supplies and services
expenditures:

' Increases in utilities expenditures, including
increased load factors on existing facilities, rate
increases for sewage and water, and new facility
usage:

' A $3 million increase in academic program
initiatives;

- A $500,000
acquisitions;

' A $1 million increase to the deans‘ share of
the research development fund; and

' An increase in financial aid equivalent to
the tuition increase.’

increase in library

Ramicone explained thatthe current draft parameters
still result in a $1.2 million deﬁcit, but that by the time
they are presented to the board for approval, adjustments
would take place to present a balanced budget. Cassing
moved that the committee approve the FY 2004 planning
and budgeting parameters as presented by the parameters
subcommittee. Dunbar-Jacob seconded.

Wion expressed concern that, given the 2.4%
inﬂation increase in the past year, thev3% increase in
salaries would not permit lhe university to give a full
increase for maintenance of real salary for satisfactory
performance and also provide adequate funds for
merit, market, and equity. He suggested that doing so
would require at least a 3.9% increase. Wion moved
to amend the parameters, changing the recommended
3.0% salary increase to 3.3% by moving $1 million
from the academic initiatives expenditure line and using
those funds for market adjustments. Cassing seconded.
Discussion ensued including the efforts made to keep
medical insurance costs to employees down (signiﬁcant
portion of the past year’s inflation increase), which
represents a prc-tax savings. Maher stated that few public
universities are currently investing as heavily in salaries
as the university. Cochran expressed concern over the
reduction of flexibility availablcito supervisors to address
salary concerns. Wion withdrew the motion to amend the
recommendation of thciparametcrs subcommittee. The‘
committee voted unanimously to approve the FY 2004
planning and budgeting parameters as submitted by the
parameters subcommittee. .

The committee discussed a recommended
distribution of the proposed salary increase.
Cassell moved that the committee recommend
a distribution of 1.5% for maintenance of real
salary, 1.0% for merit/market/equity, and 0.5%
for centrally-administered market funds. Cochran

UPMC minutes are available at:
http://www.pitt.edu/~jdl1/ UPBC-min utes.htm

seconded. Holderindicated that this distribution

was approved by the parameters subcommittee
in its final meeting. Wion moved to modify the

' recommended distribution to 2.0% for maintenance

of real salary and 1.0% for unit merit/market/equity

with no centrally-administered market funds with the ,

understanding that some ofthe academic initiatives
money could be used for this purpose. Cassing
seconded. Cassing stated that neglecting cost of
living increases is not a sound long-terr_n policy and
that maintaining real salaries is important to avoid
erosion of salaries as well as to promote employee
morale. Maher stated that adequately funded merit
increases also contribute to promoting morale.
Levine agreed, stating that it is intellectually and
psychologically attractive to lean toward merit
increases. The committee voted 6 to 11 against
the amendment. With no further discussion, the
committee voted 11 to 5 approving the original
motion (with one abstention).

Report of the chair
Maher distributed copies of the memo transmitting

the recommended FY 2004 planning and budgeting '

parameters to the chancellor. .

Presentation of report on
average faculty salaries by discipline, 2002-03

Maher distributed the report comparing average
faculty salaries at the University by discipline with
comparable salaries at AAU public institutions. He
explainedthat the rules govcmingthcAAU dataexchange
limit the distribution of these data signiﬁcantly. Maher
pointed outthe progress the University has made in speciﬁc
areas, such as the natural sciences where problems existed
hiring and retaining faculty. He indicated thathiring salaries

~ atAAU publics are now considered when faculty searches

are approved.

Cassell raised the issue of finding similar common V

understandings and peer comparisons for the regional
campuses. M aher indicated that some market salary funds
have been put into regional campus faculty salaries, but
that ﬁnding appropriate peer comparisons is made difficult
by the university’s geographical location between East
Coast schools (where higher costs of living produce
salaries generally higher than those at the University)
andMidwest and Southern schools (with salaries generally
lower than those at the University). Maher also cited the
need for more meaningful input into the discussion from
the regional campuses.

Members discussed other factors affecting the
data, such as the distribution of faculty by rank and early
retirement initiatives.

Presentation of the revenue and cost attribution study

Wion summarized the history of the study and
the rationales supporting its continued production. He
explained the types of costs delineated in the report and
the methodology used to attribute the costs of support
units. Wion particularly cited the improvement in
athletics funding in recent years. Members discussed
the methodology by which the costs of certain units are
attributed to academic unit. Wion indicated that efforts
will proceed this summer to review this and other issues,
and to explore ways to simplify the report and make it
more efficient.“

Court ban of death penalty for  

mentally retarded expected to be
limited in scope, lecturer says

recent Supreme Court
decision banning the
xecution of persons

with mental retardation is
unprecedented, but unlikely to
impact other kinds of capital
punishment cases, according to
a legal scholar lecturing here
last week.

“The decision of the court
[in Atkins v. Virginia] in 2002
does not rest on the traditional
model or usual line of diminished
responsibility, which has a rich
legal tradition, a rich philosophi-

cal tradition an_d has been stan- '

dard sentencing practice'in our
system,” said Richard]. Bonnie,
John S. Battle Professor of Law at
the University ofVirginia School
of Law. “The court [instead] used
a model of diagnostic exclusion,
that is, using the clinical deﬁni-
tion of mental retardation to
preclude capital punishment. I
think this is odd, and it’s com-
pletely unprecedented in consti-
tutional law; unprecedented, but
defensible.”

Bonnie spoke Nov. 13 at the
fourth annual Pitt School of Law’s
Distinguished Nordenberg Lec-
ture on “Diagnosis, Diminished
Responsibility and the Death
Penalty: Implications of the

, Supreme Court’s Decision Ban-
ning_Execution, of Persons with,

Mental Retardation.”

Some legal scholars see‘ the
decision inAtkins as a signal that
the Supreme Court will be more
likely to review capital punish-

ment cases, but Bonnie -thinks

that is unlikely. “The Supreme
Court might have said: The
Constitution precludes the death
penalty for those with diminished
responsibility or capacity to make
moral judgment due to: mental
retardation, immaturity, mental

. illness, mental disorder, whatever

the categories,” Bonnie said, but
instead the court limited the lan-
guage to mental retardation as
established in a clinical sense.
“It’s important to note, too,

_ that we’re talking about the

sentencing phase.here,” Bonnie

‘said. “In Darryl Atkins’s‘case, he

was found competent to stand

-trial, there was no self-defense

claim and his‘ criminal liability
seemed clear. Assuming that the
death sentence had been properly

imposed [at the initial trial], the '

  

Pa tria 'agle "

courtwas asked to rule if a person -

could be determined to be ‘not
competent for execution’ because
he did not understand‘ the nature’
and the purpose of the punish-
ment being’ imposed.” ’
"The court held in a 6-3 deci- ‘
sion that the 8th Amendments
clause banning cruel and unusual
punishment precludes the impo-
sition of ,the’death penalty on a 9

person with mental retardation,

/ which was a reversal of its 1989
ruling in a 5 -4 "decision, Bonnie’ _

said. »

sensus between,1989 and 2002 in, ’

sentencing phase,” Bonnie said.
“Presumably, if a person does
not understand the nature of
the execution punishment they
would not be competent to stand
trial to begin with, but we know
there are a lot of people on death
row with mental retardation.”
In fact the court in At/eins
h ld th’ d‘ ' ' b
up e e istinction etween
competence to stand trial and
competence to be executed.
' “Excerpting fromthe ‘deci-

, sion, theacourt said: ‘Mentally T

“In my opinion, the Supreme

.’Court was acknowledging a

concern that the system has
not worked properly in going
through those earlier stagesof
trial,” Bonnie said. “That has

Amendment.” A _
While state laws vary in their

sentence-phase instructions,

to juries (or, in some states, to
sentencing judges) among the 36
states nationally that allow capital
punishment, the prevailing model

a is the same: Weigh aggravating

circumstances (barbarity, bru-

tality, torture and whether the ~-
, defendant presents a -continuing

danger to society) against miti-
gating circumstances (typically
factors relating to responsibility,
culpability or lack of .pre—media-
tion) in deathpenalty sentencing
decisions. _ s I , 1 j

_ “The court observed that
'the're'are cases in which the

' mitigating -evidence of the most

severe diminished capacity might

also be the [cause] that results in

’ the most aggravating circum-

stance, in terms of brutality, for
example,” Bonnie said. ,

“I think overall the legal
system tilts toward the death pen-
alty. Jurors, particularly, tend to

devalue mitigating evidencegand

diminished responsibility in the
-face of evidence of aggravation.
They are discouraged from con-
sidering mitigating factors.”

Bonnie cited a Texas statute ‘

as Exhibit A. “The Texas statute

says, ‘If you ﬁnd this defendant '

likely to commit future violence,
if you think the answer to that is

a yes, you should impose the death

V penalty no matter the mitigating _
evidence.”’ A '

' VVhile thatstatute is uniisual,

“the tendency everywhere is to
favor aggravatingover mitigating
evidence,” he said. “Occasionally,
there is some relief from appel-
late courts who reverse a death
penalty, but that has never hap-

. pened in Texas or Virginia, and

only occasionally in Florida, to
pick three sample states not quite
at random.” ‘

A number of capital punish-
ment states also have accepted
verdicts of “‘ guilty, but mentally
ill,’ which give juries the idea that
they are showing some leniency,
when in fact they are not,” Bonnie
said. “The proof of that is that in
a number of cases defendants have
been found guilty but mentally
ill, then juries go on to the sen-

tenceephase and impose the" death‘-

penalty. The Supreme Court has
said to those states, ‘How can you
say‘ that the defendant is men-

tally ill, which obviously carries

somejmessage of less responsibil-
ity,‘and then“ impose the death
sentence?”’  ’ 1

development and moral’ matu-
rity, and of neural development
as the. underpinnings .of moral
judgment and moral cognition,”
Bonnie maintained.

“So, I delayed-onset _mental ’

disorders, for example, may
not-. actually, be —. ‘covered-,by this

    

they seem morally equivalent,
because the deficiency with
mentalretardation is moral
experience. Presumably, people,
with delayed—onset disorders
have had the moral experience,
so categorical exclusion of the

death penalty isn’t' appropriate,

although it obviously has to b
considered in cases.” ~ e I

To allow states to legislate‘

cut-off points in deﬁning mental

retardation, such as IQ levels of .

70, is too arbitrary, Bonnie
noted. ’

“The model  analogous’

to age,” he said. “There are
exclusionarycriteria on age. In
a typical state, if [a person] has
not reached 10, he can’t go>to
criminal court; if he’s 14 or 15
he’s subject to criminal court, but
not subject to the death penalty;
if he’s 18, in most ‘states, yes, he

can be executed. But what about _

._ the range of maturity? We know

there will be some variations,
some who are 16vwho are more

umature than some 17 year-olds, '
and so on.” V V’ ,»
Under long-standing legal

tradition, deciding the severity
of the sentence ought to relate
in some wayto the defendant’s
responsibility for the crime.
In Atkins, the Supreme Court
ruled that, by deﬁnition, mental
retardation means diminished
culpability. ' I V V ’ S
’ “My interpretation is that the
Supreme Court wanted a clini-

cal deﬁnition of mental retarda— ‘ .

tion, notwithstanding that we’re
applying this to the legal process,”
Bonnie said. “The decision is very
interesting and defensible, but
without a long reach.” 1 ‘

contempt, and holding a public

forum on shared governance
could have led to a brawl.

- V Well, maybe not a brawl.

But suggesting that faculty and

administrators work collegially’ t

together in governing Pitt surely
would have invoked sarcasm and
snide comments. .
In contrast, the Senate’s Nov.
6 plenary session, “Perspectives
on Shared Governance,” turned
out instead to be (apart from
occasional criticisms) “a love-
fest,” as moderator James Cass-
ing observed.

Cassing, an economics pro— '
fessor, was oneof four former.

University Senate presidents who

joined currentpresidentNicholas I
G. Bircher, Chancellor Mark A,"

Nordenberg and Provost James
V. Maher to ‘discuss the faculty’s
role in helping to run the Uni-7
” versity. i

“I would say that the processes

of shared governance here at Pitt
over the course of the past several
.,years have been productive and,
even when not pleasant, certainly
civil,” said Nordenberg, giving
“considerable credit” for this
civility to the Senate presidents.
James G. Holland, an emeri-

tus professor of psychology who

' clashed memorably with previ-
ous Pitt administrators When he

presided over the Senate in the
early 1990s, said the Universityis
“fortunate right now in having a
really great central adminis-
tration” —‘ although, Holland
warned, this “could easily lull
us into losing track of why it is
important to have an independent
Senate.” -

Even audience members

‘joined in the love-fest.

‘ “Shared governance at the
University of Pittsburgh does
work,” declared Rich Colwell,
president of Pitt’s Staff Associa-
tion ..Cs2unci1.(SA.(_3)..d11.tiI1g.t11c
quesu'on—and—ansWersessionthat

followed the speakers’ remarks. '

A SAC ofﬁcer for many years,
Colwell serves on various Pitt
governance groups, including
Senate Council and the Uni-

‘ versity Planning and Budgeting

Committee. ‘ A
John P. VVilliams, chairperson
of the University’s anesthesiology

department, favorably compared —

Pitt and the University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center (UPMC)
with his former employer, UCLA,
a school noted for its long tradi-
tion of shared governance.

“I can tellyouthat the level
of shared governance that I have
experienced here, both at Pitt and
inside the medical center, is head
and shoulders above what I saw

I go on at UCLA,” said Williams.‘
For example, Pitt and UPMC

administrators solicited and

I _: followed faculty advice in over-

hauling the UPMC central billing

i office, he said. ~

Shared governance within
UPMC and Pitt’s medical school
has improved at an evolutionary
pace rather than a dramatic one
“but it is getting better,” said
VV1lliams.

“Meanwhile at UCLA, the
medical school and the hospital
associated with it have been put
underoutside management,” he
pointed out. “That’s because
there is not this kind of shared
governance that goes on at
UPMC. And while it may not

‘be perfect, it is a heck of a lot

better than what I see going on
at UCLA currently.”
A El

In contrast to Williams,
Senate president Bircher rated
UPMC as being closer to the

“pure dictatorship” end, of the
governance spectrum thanthe
“pure democracy” end.
Specifically, Bircher — a
former lieutenant inthe, U.S. .
Navy’ i——‘ ranked‘  I gov: ‘
ernance system midway between

    
  
  
 
   
  
 
  
     

mber  asam;

the Navy’s (“if you know how to
work the system, the Navy has a
good process” and low—ranking
officers and seamen have “some
voice” in governance, Bircher
said) and the one aboard the
H.M.S. Bounty (scene of a notori-
ous breakdown in collegiality).
According to Bircher, accoun-
tants at UPMC “govern the

_ budget and generally are unavail- -

able for comment”. . . “lawyers are
the best listeners and the most
responsive if your case has been
made well”. . .and “expert medical
opinion carries no weight beyond
the advisory level.”

During the three years prior
to June 1999, when Williams
became chairperson of anesthe-
siology, that department suffered
a 200 percent turnover rate, as
82 faculty members left and the
unit was downsized from 68 to
41 full—time faculty positions,
said Bircher, who is an associate
professor of anesthesiology and
critical care medicine.

“I do believe that this is a
world’s record both in terms of
absolute numbers and in terms
of turnover,” Bircher said, blam-
ing the department’s problems
largely on high—handed man-
agement. '

Compared with governance in
UPMC and the medical school,
shared governance in the rest of
the University “really provides us
with a pretty good opportunity to
show up and speak up,” Bircher
said. He noted that the Senate
played a pivotal role several years

_ ago in forcing public discussions

of the contract negotiations that
led to the formaiion of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Physicians
practice plan.

Integrating writing
& speaking in class

f students developed and

reﬂected on both their oral

and writing skills in the
same class, would such integra-
tion increase the effectiveness of
those literacies?

Two‘ Pitt professors reported
on their efforts to answer that
question based on their project
called Integrating Oral and Writ-
ing Skills, one of 15 ﬁmded 2002
innovation in teaching proposals
presented at the annual Teaching
in Excellence Fair Nov. 14.

John Poulakos, Department

of Communication, and Patri-

cia Sullivan, English depart-
ment, team—taught a course in
speech composition. that asked

students to transform their

essays into speeches and their
speeches into essays; to reﬂect
on the complementary nature
of writing and speaking, and to
complete a questionnaire about
their educational experiences.
“I have for many years taught
public speaking, including speech
composition, but never from
the ground up,” Poulakos said.
“I paid almost no attention to
the instruction of writing, or
the mutually supportive aspects

Asof these two modes of commu-

nicating. Professor Sullivan has
taught writing for many years,
so we attempted to combine our
strengths.” .’ A -

Students were asked to pick’ a

s entire; *s,“ér'rrest“e1‘.-' * Sli'0’rt *

“Alarge part of the class was to
reflect on that,” Poulakos added.

' “At the end we gave them a survey

with many questions, including
some open-ended ones: Tell us
if they thought this was beneﬁ-
cial —— they reported that it was.
Should there be more courses of
this kind? —— they said yes. Did it
help their speaking skills? -— they
said yes. Did it help their writing
— they said yes.” A "
As a control factor, Poulakos
videotaped. presentations in the
class and . asked two outside
viewers to judge those against
videotaped presentations from
a class he taught by himself.
“Their report was that the
presentations in our class were
signiﬁcantly better than in my

. class,” he said.

Whether students’ writing
improved‘-was less clear, Sullivan
said. “Students were struggling
to move between modalities. At
ﬁrst writing is an obstacle to their
speaking, because they can’t get

outthe [same amount of material] A

in 5 or 10 minutes. If they’don’t
have a set thesis with a couple of
supporting points that animate or
sustain their papers, then they’re
really stuck when they go to give
the oral presentation.”

But it’s encouraging that
students felt their writing had
improved despite their opinion
that writing is the more difﬁcult
skill, Sullivan said.

A “The best papers _have_ the ,

— to having to give the speech, let’s

the student had to turn the same

topic into an essay for a reader."

“We discussed explicitly and

and differences,” Sullivan con-

tinued,’ “the different rhetorical

Sullivan said. “But then you

The professors agreed that the

have toiget up in front of a class
full of staring peers. “So even
though they said writing.-was
more difﬁcult, they were more
committed to writing a text that

enough instead of writing an
essay that would be viewedby
two [faculty] readers,” Sullivan
said. '

“It appears the kind of writing '

they were doing in our class was
often somehow biased or inﬂu-
enced by the idea that they were
going to present it,” Poulakos
said-. “They learned that to write
an essay that will be turned over
to readers and to write something

True to the tradition of faculty
sharing thoughts on teaching, the

I Integrating Oral and Writing

Skills presentation morphed into
a discussionAof speaking across

A the curriculum, when, following

their presentation, Poulakos and
Sullivan joined a separate teach-
ing conversation moderated by
Peter Simonson of the commu-
nication department. .
Simonson said thatthe move
to implement speaking curricu-

but has its origins in the early
1980s with the British model of
teaching language across the cur-
riculum. “It’s really a movement

to simulate the classic small liberal .

' arts college where students need;

A to learn to speakin alltheir classes .
to demonstrate their mastery of .
a subject,” Simonson said. “The 9

basic principle of this approach

Among the benefits of speak-
ing assignments, regardless of the

A discipline, are-5 aiding students in’

formulating their thoughts more

__clearly,_testing what they know):

and don’t know, and synthesiz-

ing material to communicate to ._

others’. These activities also pro-
vide opportunities for students to
improve thinking skills and to
engage in ‘problem—solving and

' other active learning techniques,

Simonson said. ' . ,
In adapting speaking to their

courses, he said, faculty should ‘
be awareof the variety of pos- -

sibili/ties, including speeches or
presentations, in-class ‘debates,

full-class discussions,’ small-
group or team—based oral work,
one—on-one presentations and
oral examinations. “Videotap-
ing students speak is very helpful
for the students’ self-evaluation,
and it’s relatively low-intensive
labor for the instructor,” Simon-
son said. V _
The group ‘of discussants
agreed on ' the importance of
learning speaking skills, despite
V I  ..of
public
dents.
Some highlights -of the con-
versation: A

0 “Being afraid of speak-
ing publicly is consistent with
developmental psychology,”
said Mary Margaret Kerr, asso-
ciate professor of education and
child psychiatry. “VVhen we’re in
grades 1 to 3 we think everyone
thinks we’re cute. But by third
grade, we begin to need peer-
approval. Speakingin front of
an audience of peers raises the
stakes that much higher.”

° “I didn’t become comfort-
able with speaking in front of a
class until I became a teacher,”
said Sullivan.“‘Once you’ve lived
through it, you gain conﬁdence, '
and you get beyond embarrass-
ment...So I think experience and
practice are very important. ”

° “One of the most important
things students need to learn in »
speaking is to stay With_ one
central point or idea,” Poulakos
said. “Students get very excited.
They want to tell everything: ‘I
found this, and I found this, and
I} found this,’ instead of staying A
with the center of gravity of what .

speaking among ‘stu-

A ”they’re reporting. Mind you, I
‘ catch. myself having the same

problem. You have to learn to
make judgments. Part of it is
time. restraints in a speech, and
part of it relates to the speciﬁc
audience you are addressing who
have to understand what you’re

talking about.”

° Simonson said ,he empha-
sizes paying attention _to the
audience in his communication
classes. “I tell students to be pre-
pared to speak on any of three

topics that I give them before-
hand. They-come into class and
pick one out of a hat. But then I
say: ‘Now explain that topic to a
lst—grader, or explain it to your
mother.’” ' *

° Kerr said that many students
resent being called on in class. “I
don’t care. I call on them anyway.
I want them to be able to think
on their feet and not be able to
hide.”

a lot of pressure to be able to
speak, which is appropriate to
a superintendents’ job. We do
simulated press conferences.
‘You’re going to be asked about
a teacher in your district who was
picked up on a DUI last night.’
They have about 10 minutes to
prepare. They have to be aware
of conﬁdentiality issues, parents’
concerns, and they have to face
merciless questions.”

° Sullivan reported a recent
example of a spectacular success
with students speaking in a writ-
ing course. “I assigneda 1-2 page
paper. Usually,‘ the assignments
are analytic, but sometimes I
like them to be creative. So
this time I offered extra credit
for students who would read
their paper aloud, and even
more extra credit if they would
memorize them or perform them:
say, write a song version based on
“Antigone,” for example. Well,
15 or so of them did-this! There

' is something about role—playing ;
+and perhaps, something about .

extra credit — something about

_ how when you role—play you are
not you, and therefore you are A
not responsible for opinions,” .

that helps overcome the fear of
speaking. I j

' Kerr said, “It just struck
me listening to this group, that

ins_truction in how to prepare ‘ ’

dissertation defenses. Maybe
there should be.”

° VVhile governance pro-
cesses are important, their
success depends on the actions
of the administrators in power.
“Their attitude and their abili-
ties can destroy, or at least greatly
weaken, the process and struc-
tures that have been created,”
Hershey said.

School of Dental Medicine
professor John Baker agreed.
Baker, who during the 19903
bitterly criticized his school’s
then-dean, Jon Suzuki, at meet-
ings of Senate Council and
Faculty Assembly, praised the
school’s current administration
under Dean Thomas W. Braun.
“People do make shared gover-
nance work,” Baker said during
the plenary session’s question-
and—answer period, “and I think
shared governance in the dental
school has worked very well in
recent years.” '

Hershey argued that “changes
in the University have altered
administrator-faculty relation-
ships. The tradition of collegiality
has been replaced in large mea-
sure by a management-worker
approach” in which department
Chairpersons evaluate faculty “in a
more formal and speciﬁc manner,
often with a quantitative grading
emphasis. This change has cre-
ated much greater potential for
conﬂict.” *

Hershey proposed thatPitt, in
searching for department chairs
and deans, adopt an application
form similar to the forms used
by hospitals in evaluating prac-
titioners seeking medical staff
appointments.

Prospective Chairpersons and
deans would be asked: Have you

ever been named as an offender I

in an action brought by a fac-
ulty member or student for
harassment, retaliation or other
improper behavior? Have you
ever been the subject of a griev-
ance complaint in a university or
civil process by a faculty member,
student or subordinate?

Under Hershey’s scheme,
candidates who answered “yes” to
either question would be required
to describe the nature of the legal
action and/or complaint and its
outcome.

“Academic administrators in
an increasingly regulated envi-
ronment have moredifﬁcult jobs
than theirpredecessors,” Hershey
concluded. “This helps to explain
the gulf that many see as being
destructive of collegiality. It may
be that shared governance is an
objective that’s increasingly out of
reach. Academic administrators
need to recognizethat to build
their own success, they need to
respect faculty for whom, and to
whom, they are responsible.”

Former Senate president
Gordon K. MacLeod, an emeri-
tus professor of health services

“academic commission” to
address University-wide issues.
Membership on each coun-
cil would be lirnited to tenured
faculty members and the dean

‘or campus president, with the

chancellor and provost as ex-
ofﬁcio members, MacLeod said.
The council would serve as the
governing board for its respec-
tive school or regional campus,
entrusted with matters of gover-
nance and education policy and
making recommendations to the
provost and chancellor for tenure
appointments.

The University-wide com-
mission could be composed
of one representative member
from each school or campus’s
council. _

“Professors on each council
and the commission could invite
other faculty members of any
rank to attend their individual
meetings,” MacLeod said. “At
all meetings, action would be
taken by a majority vote of a
designated quorum of those
present and voting.”

MacLeod argued that his
plan would provide for more
school—level autonomy in Uni-
versity governance. But Provost

 

 

Maher said Pitt’s system already
resembles MacLeod’s plan in
that the University’s schoolsand
regional campuses — and many
departments —— maintain their
own self—governance organiza-
tions, rules for awarding tenure,
traditions and administrative

A processes. All of these have been

reviewed by the provost’s ofﬁce
to make sure they comply with
general University guidelines,
said Maher, who also criticized
MacLeod’s proposed system for
excluding staff, students and non-
tenured faculty.

Maher said: “I think the
problem is, when you talk

about ‘governance’ too many

people think you mean only the
Senate. And the Senate is a’ crucial
part, particularly for its role in
criticizing how Well the system
is working or isn’t working” but
the Senate is far from being the
only player in shared governance
here, he said. '

In addition to describing
school and departmental systems,
Maher cited the following groups
— each of which is dominated by
faculty, many of them represent-
ing Senate committees: .

0 At the provost’s level, three

groups -— the Provost’s Advisory
Council on Undergraduate Pro-
grams, the University Council on
Graduate Studies and the Advi-
sory Council on Instructional
Excellence —— help to set teaching
and curriculum policies.

° Similarly, the University
Research Council, the Commit-
tee on Academic Computing and
various ad hoc committees advise
the-provost on research issues. ’

° The Information Technol-
ogy Steering Committee, chaired
by M-aher, advises the chancellor
on technology issues. “You’ve
seen enormous changes in the
last few years in our computer
infrastructure and in the use
and availability of computing
in the classroom as well as in
the research labs,” Maher said.
“That’s all come out of the delib-
erations of this committee.”

°_ The University Planning
and Budgeting Committee,
which Maher also chairs, annu-

. ally recommends a Pitt operating

budget to the chancellor. In some
years, the chancellor has accepted
these proposed budgets in their
entirety, said Maher. “When that
didn’t happen, the modiﬁcations

were really modest and frequently A

were driven bylegislalive changes
that came after the committee
had made its recommendation,”
he said.

“I don’t want to pretend that
everything is right” in University
governance, the provost said. “I
do want to tell you that I think

we have a wonderful system here .~

It comes awfully close to what
Gordon was recommending. It’s
just that you’ve got to spread your
arms a little wider and realize that,
for reasons of diversity that we
cherish, we have diffused it over
the schools rather than making a
one-size—ﬁts—all system.”
Maher called on Senate lead-
ers to respect the rest of Pitt’s
governance system, particularly

in supporting faculty with griev-

ances against their schools.

“We don’t hire anybody
around here who isn’t smart,”
he said, and smart people who
wind up ,on the losing end
of tenure and/or promotion
decisions often think of smart,
complex arguments to promote
their causes.

Sometimes, these arguments
can’t be reconciled with indi-
vidual schools’ policies, Maher
noted. “It’s my job to make sure
that the [school’s] process is
respected, and sometimes that
means saying: ‘Your colleagues
have voted, and even though I
may or may not agree with your
colleagues they’ve got a valid
process, they have followed it,
and you’ve been voted down,
and I’m sorry.”’

Other times, Maher said,

qfaculty grievances spark public

debates that result in the pro-
vost’s ofﬁce ruling either that
the school’s process was violated
or that, even though it wasn’t
violated, Pitt’s_ academic values
require overruling it.

Quasiparticles refer to
charges that carry electrical cur-
rent, or electrons, and vibrations
of atoms, or phonons, that cause
electrical resistance in semicon-
ductor devices. According to
the laws of quantum mechanics,
a yin-yang relationship exists

between electrons and phonons '

—— the decay of one generates the
other, and vice versa.
Understandinghowquasipar-

quantum mechanical principles
that underlie how electronic

understood how silicon behaves
_in the quantum mechanical
regime, it maybe possible to
devise semiconductor chips that
are more than a thousand times
faster than current chips.
Quasiparticle buildup has
been observed in other semi-

ultrafast lasers. The success of

Protein
biomarkers

accurately,
quickly

Detection of protein abnor-

malities in cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) of patients with amyo—
trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
may allow physicians to more
rapidly diagnose and better
monitor drug efﬁcacy in clinical
trials for the disease, according
to a study presented by a Pitt
researcher Nov. 17.

These ﬁndings may lead to the
ﬁrst test for early—stage ALS, also
know as Lou Gehrig’s disease. E

The study, presented by
Robert Bowser of Pitt’s School
of.Medicine at the annual meet-
ing of the International Alliance
of ALS/MND Associations and
International Symposium on
ALS/MND, identified ALS-
speciﬁc biomarkers by protein
proﬁling of cerebrospinal ﬂuid
from 25 ALS patients and 35
control subjects.

0 “There are no known diag-
nostic biomarkers for ALS and
no sensitive methods to deter-
mine whether a particular drug

is working in an ALS patient, nor «

any way to best test drug com-
binations for effectiveness,” said
Bowser, who is associate professor
of pathology and director of the
ALS Tissue Bank at Pitt. “A panel
of biomarkers would not only be
useful in a more rapid diagnosis of
ALS, but also would be a valuable

and the control groups, Bowser
and his colleagues identified
protein biomarkers that diag-

Bowser’s research is in col-
laboration with investigators at
Massachusetts General Hospital/
Harvard.

ALS is a fatal neurodegen-
erative disease that attacks nerve
cells and pathways in the brain
and spinal cord. VVhen cells die,

voluntary muscle control and

movement are lost. Those
patients in the later stages of
the disease are totally paralyzed
even though their minds remain
alert. The average life expectancy
of a person with ALS is between
two to ﬁve years from time of
diagnosis.

Unlike the fat that accu-
mulates at other points on the
"body, waistline fat surrounds
the abdominal organs, setting
off physiological changes that
can lead to a variety of diseases
and disabilities.

A percentage of women who

gain waistline fat at middle age"

develop high levels of insulin,
or insulin resistance, throwing
off their bodies’ delicate glucose
metabolism and triggering in
some the development of smaller

. and numerous low-density lipo-

protein (LDL) particles, which
can lead to the development
of coronary calcium deposits.
These deposits indicate risk of
heart attack. .

Kuller and his colleagues
have found that monitoring a
woman’s condition through a
few simple tests can signal when
action should be taken to stop

the cascade of events that could.

otherwise lead to heart attack.
Insulin resistance can be mea-
sured by testing blood levels of
insulin, glucose and adiponectin
-— a type of fat—storing cell.
Lipoprotein particles can be
measured from a blood sample
as well, and coronary calcium
deposits can be discovered via
electron beam tomography, a
quick and non-invasive scan. If
tests show any red ﬂags, therapeu-
tic interventions can be initiated
immediately. '
“There are very effective ther-

apies, both pharmacological and
nonpharmacological, to prevent
the_progression of insulin resis-
tance, the development of small
and numerous LDL particles
and, potentially, the progres-
sion of atherosclerosis,” said
Kuller. These interventions are
now being tested in Pittsburgh as
part of the Woman On the Move
through Activity and Nutrition
(VV OMAN) study, which Kuller

is leading.

Sex-specific

Researchers at Pitt have
identified variants of a gene
that if inherited by women may
contribute to the development of
depression. The same variants do
not impact men, the researchers
sa . a
The finding, published in
the current issue of the journal
Molecular Psychiatry, is the ﬁrst
‘time scientists have been able to
zero in on a speciﬁc susceptibility
gene for depression.

that disparity.

These latest results build on
research published by Zubenko
and his team in October 2002
that identiﬁed a small region of
chromosome 2 — equal to 0.01
percent of the human genome
—— as the potential hiding place
for ‘a susceptibility gene for
depression in women.

“These ﬁndings conﬁrm our
earlier research suggesting the
existence of susceptibility genes

that have sex—limited effects on

the vulnerability of women to
developing severe depression,”
said Zubenko. “More than 80
percent of women in our study
who inherited a particular variant
of CREB1 developed depressive
disorders, while a second version
of this gene appeared to have pro-
tective effects.” I

CREB1 is a gene that encodes

Depression is the second- .

leading cause of disability world-
wide, affecting nearly 10 percent
of the population. Accordingto
George S. Zubenko, professor
of psychiatry at Pitt’s School of

University, women are twice as
likely as men to develop depres-

V Findings from the ﬁrst major

’1*6v‘éd; "  "dér'rrénu’:;t  show

the vast majority of caregivers
need more support before the

death of their loved one.
The results appeared Nov. 12

in the New.England Journal of

‘ Medicine. , .
According to “lead author‘

Richard Schulz, professor of A

psychiatry at Pitt’s School of
Medicine, family caregivers of
patients with end—of-life demen-
tia endure a protracted and stress-
ful period of caregiving prior to
death, but after death" express
considerable - relief and remark-
able emotional resiliency. ‘

Schulz said: “It is possible
that caregivers who know. their
loved one is on a trajectory
towards death grieve for that
person before death.”

At the same time, the research
showed that after the death,
caregivers had clinically lower
depression within three months
and signiﬁcant declines in depres-
sion after a year.

Schulz and his colleagues fol-
lowed 217 family caregivers of

. persons with dementia during the

year before the patient’s death,
then continued to follow them
for a year afterwards.

Half of the caregivers reported
spending at least 46 hours per
week assisting patients with
daily activities that ranged from
preparing their meals to bathing
and dressing them.

“This study gives us insight
into the experiences of many of
the 6 million people who pro-
vide long-term, unpaid care to
disabled elderly persons in their
families,” said Schulz, who also is
director of the University Center
for Social and Urban Research
and associate director -of Pitt’s
Institute on Aging.

“The service, these people

provide saves the health care ’

system billions of dollars a year,
while‘ the caregivers themselves "
endure both emotional and ﬁnan-
cial stress. Because the number
of people in this situation will

increase markedly over the next

Downtown at the William

ney Dick Thornburgh was
attending a continuing legal
education program when it was
announced that shots had been
fired at President Kennedy’s
motorcade in Dallas.
- “You could feel’ a wave of con-
cern ripple through the meeting

remember was having any sort
of conversation about what it all
meant. It was just a pretty silent
ride.”

Sherry Miller Brown, direc-

recalls: “I was in_the 1 1th grade at ‘

St. Basil’s in Carrick. To Catho-
lies, the president was like Saint
John F. Kennedy. I remember
that, after Kennedy was elected,
there was a picture of him next to

Thornburgh gravitated on Nov.
22, 1963, to a house of worship

. —' in his case, Trinity Episcopal
Church, next door to his Down— —

town law office — to pray for the
nation. ‘

I “In 1963, the idea that the
president could be assassinated
was just unthinkable,” he points
out. “In 1968, we would have the
tragic assassinations of Martin
Luther King and Bobby Ken-
nedy. In later years, there would
be attempts against the lives _of
other American presidents. So,
the idea of political assassina-

. Cl

Baby boomers such as‘ Pitt
Chancellor Mark A. Norden-
berg were in elementary or
secondary school when they
learned ofJFK’s assassination. “I
was a freshman in high school in
Duluth, lVIinn., sitting in math
class with 30 or 40 other kids in
these old-fashioned desks, when
the news came over the school’s
public address system,” Norden-
berg remembers. A

At Squirrel Hill’s Taylor All-
derdice ' High School, Betsy A.
Porter was in swimming class. “It
came over the loudspeaker that

"the president had been shot in

Dallas,” says Porter, who today is

P Pitt’s director of Admissions and

Everyone was dumbstruck. And I
remember the nun in our class ran
across the room and fell on her
knees in front of the president’s
picture and said, ‘Forgive them,
Lord, for theyknow notwhatthey
do.’ It was very dramatic.” ' '
Like Porter, Brown vividly
remembers her father’s.reaction
to the assassination. _
“Later in the day, I was watch-

ing_TV with-my dad, who was ’

a World War II vet who never
- talked about the war and who
was very patriotic,” Brown says,
“I looked over andhe was crying.
I had never seen him cry before. I
said, ‘Daddy, what’s wrong? ’ And
he said, ‘I can’t believe I live in a
. country where someone would
kill the president.’ I never forgot

that, because that’s when it really ‘

hit me. I was 16 at the time and
wasn’t really into politics, but I
knew then that this was really
important if my dad was crying
about it.” _ . '
Donna Mihalik, office
manager for Pitt’s Student Gov-
ernment Board, likewise was

attendinga Catholic high school,

in J ohnstown, when she leamed_

that the president had been shot.
Butitwas a lay teacher who broke
the news. . » e V
' _ “He got called out into the hall
by one of the nuns, and remained
out there for what seemed like
a really long time,” she says.
“Finally, he came back into the
‘classroom with this look of terror
on his face, totally white. He told
us, ‘There are reports that the

president has been shot.’ We just

sat there, stunned.”
Class was d_isrnissed_ for the

 

rest of the day and Mihalik
went home to watch TV with
her mother. Hours later, her
father came home from work
and joined them. “We were in
disbelief, that somethinglike that
could. happen,” Mihalik recalls.
“It was like a nightmare.”
CI .

Nov. 22, 1963, promised to

be an important dayin the life of

17-year-old William A. Savage;

of Chicago. As president of his
high school’s student council,
Savage — who dreamed of a
career in politics, and whose

-heroes included President Ken-

nedy — would have the honor of
introducing a visiting Malaysian
diplomat to an assembly of about
800 of his classmates. A
Savage was in the principal’s
office, being introduced to the
diplomat prior to accompany-
ing him to the school » audito-
rium, when an assistant principal
rushed into the room and blurted
out, “The president has been shot
in Dallas. He’s dead.” ,
Too staggered to feel sorrow at
ﬁrst, Savage just felt-numb. And

then, ashamed. “Here I was, in

the company of this visitor from .-

another country, learning that the
PFESideI.1.t..QfII1Y °WI.1.CQ.1%..I1t1’Y. had

Savage, who today is assistant to

Chancellor Nordenberg and

director of Afﬁrmative Action.
Savage’sclassmates,assembled
in the high school’s auditorium,
still hadn’t heard the terrible
news. It fell upon Savage to tell
them. . .
Right until the instant he

‘opened his mouth to speak,

Savage remembers, he’d kept
cool. “But as soon as.I started to
make the announcement, I had
to ﬁght to hold back the tears,
trying to .be strong,” he says. “It
was like, all of a sudden, I realized

what a tragedy it was. For me, it ,

felt like a personal ‘loss. ” .
Savage still recalls the stunned

A silence that immediately followed

his announcement. The student
body at his school was highly
diverse, including many African
Americans like Savage as well as
students descended from Ukrai-
nians, -Italians and literally 30

other nationalities and ethnic_

groups, he says. “President
Kennedy had been very popular
among most of us.” ,

“At first, I’m ‘not sure if

everyone believed what I’d told’
them,” says Savage..“Remember, »

they hadn’t heard the news ofli-
cially on the radio or on T-Vyet. ”
But gradually, as it sank in that

Savage was serious and wasn’t

playing some bizarre prank, he
heard muffled gasps and snifﬂing
from the audience. One after‘
another, his fellow students had
begun sobbing.

In Seattle, Nicholas G.
Bircher’s 3rd grade teacher
was assigned the duty of telling

Bircher and his classmates that '

the president was dead. “Given

the time difference, we learned
about the assassination before
lunch,” says Bircher, who today
is a Pitt associate professor of
anesthesiology and critical care
medicine, and president of the
University Senate.

-“None of us was particu-
larly hungry that day,” Bircher
remembers,

, Half a world away, in India,
economics student Vijai Singh
was attending class at Lucknow
University when one of his pro-
fessors suddenly announced, “A
great tragedy has happened. We
still do not know exactly what is
going on, but President Kennedy
apparently has been killed.” The
professor did not yet know the
circumstances of Kennedy’s
death.

“We were in shock because
everybody in India knew who
President Kennedy was, and he

a was really idolized,” says Singh,

who today is Pitt’s associate
chancellor.

“Everybody admired him,
in some cases without lmowing
exactly what his policies were,
because he represented ideals of
democracy and decency, as well
as equality for the Third World.
Even poor people in India had
pictures of President Kennedy on
the walls of their homes.”

Among Indians, no American
president since has inspired any-
thing like the admiration they felt
for JFK, according to Singh.

“It was incredible, emotion-
ally, in class when we heard
the news he had been killed,”
Singh says. “We students were

disniissed. The class could not ~

have continued that day.”

Marilyn Alberter, who

today is" the registrar at ‘Pitts

Johnstown campus, was a 6th’

grader at'Westside Elementary

School in the Johnstown area on
Nov. 22, 1963.

“I remember seeing some
teachers whispering in the hall,
and then our teacher told us the
president had been shot. Then we
were sent home from school.

“I think we were old enough

_ to understand it, but still too

young to know the impact ithad
on adults. I remember my whole
farnilywatching black-and-white
TV constantly for the next few
days, including Oswald getting

shot. And today, when I think‘ of
the funeral, I think ofJohn-John
and how he’s dead now, too.

“Gosh, it’s been 40 years, and
I still think of that funeral and

John—John.”

Norman Scanlon, vice

president for academic affairs at
the Greensburg campus, says: “I
remember a weird thing, actually.
Iwas an undergrad at St. Vincent’s
College, and I was bumming a
ride home to Pittsburgh with a
history professor of mine. As we
‘were leaving campus, we were
ﬂagged down and told about
the assassination. Except, we
were told that both Kennedy
and Johnson were dead.”

Scanlon remembers his his-
tory professor exclaiming: “Oh,
my God! Then Mike McCor-
mack” — who was Speaker of
the House -at that time, andinext
in the line of succession — “is
president!”

“I remember we rode on in
silence the whole trip, just trying
to get any information we could
on the radio,” Scanlon says. “And
I remember being glued to- the
television for days after that.”

Greensburg campus English
professor Don Reilly remem-
bers: “I was teaching at Bethany
College then. A student came
into my ofﬁce, white and shaken,
and said ‘Have you heard?’ I said,
‘Have I heard what? ’ ‘That Ken-
nedy was killed.’ And Iremember
quite clearly telling him, ‘That’s
nothing to joke about.’

“Bethany’s administration
had to decide whether to cancel
classes, and they decided not to.
So, I met my Friday class that
afternoon. I went into class and
said, ‘You all know what’s hap-
pened. I don’t have ‘anything to
sayaboutit,'rnyself.’ButI’n17 going
to read you something.’”

Reilly read from Walt VVhit-
man’s “On the Assassination
of President Lincoln,” which
includes the lines: “He leaves ﬁ2r
Americai" history and hiography, so

ﬁzr, not only its most dramatic remi-
niscence — he leaves, in my opinion,
the greatest, hest,_most characteristic,
artistic, moral personality. ” .

Reilly says: “I knew Whitman
was trying to heal the country
with that piece, and it was the
bestI could come up with under
the circumstances.”

Pitt part of new NSF research center

Anew National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) research centerwith
promise to revolutionize product
design by making consumers and
manufacturers part of the design
process will be based at Pitt and
the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst. ~ ,

The Center for e-Design
and Realization of Engineered

' Products and Systems is an NSF

Industiy/UniversityCooperative
Research Center, merging the
strengths of the two universities
with a dozen industry partners.
The NSF, member companies,
government agencies and the
universities are providing ‘$3
million over the ﬁrst ﬁve years,
in addition to in—kind support;
More universities and companies
are expected to join the center.
“The center will revolutionize
the ways‘ products are conceived,
designed, realized and serviced in
the world and will spread this new
knowledge through programs
and training of a new breed of
product design engineers,” said
Bart Nnaji, center director and
Alcoa Fotmdation Professor of
Manufacturing Engineering at
Pitt’s School of Engineering.
According to Nnaji, the center
initially will focus on the aero-
space, automotive and medical
device industries. A dozen orga-
nizations already have agreed to
become corporate partners in

I the center: Wright-Patterson

Air Force Research Laboratory,
G.E. Aircraft Engine, Alcoa, Ford
Motor Company, AN SYS, Respi-
ronics, Lockheed ‘Martin, IBM,

Pratt 8: *VVhitney, vR,a_yt”he_on,_
W H ystems’ and .P‘§rametric

Technology.

“Industries are now begin-
ning to realize that the best way
to reduce life-cycle costs is to

 

5;‘

evolve a more effective product
design paradigm using the Inter-
net and web-based technologies,”
said Nnaji.

Among the most signiﬁcant
problems the e—design center
hopes to ameliorate are develop-
ment times prolonged by rede-
sign and rework, unacceptably
long break-even periods in new
design proﬁtability, the recur-
rence of earlier design problems
in later designs and lost expertise
owing to highly mobile careers.

As partners in this new design
model, consumers can ‘express
their opinions as to what com-
ponents and features are most

important, and manufacturers
can point out potential problems,
suggest ways to reduce costs or
improve products.

“One of the major issues that
industry members usuallywant to
address is being able to assure that
proprietary information from all
partners — consumers, design-

.ers and manufacturers — are

protected, while sharing enough
information to make the design
viable,” said Nnaji. “Fortunately,
the National Science Foundation
has worked out an acceptable for-
mula for industry over the last 30
years of setting up such centers
of excellence.” I
