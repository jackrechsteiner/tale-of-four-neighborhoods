Philosophy professor awarded
$1.5 million in grants for work

MICHELLE Scorr
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt professor Robert Brandom
admits to spending a lot of time, “staring
into space, thinking stuff up,” but appar-
ently, he thinks up the right stuff.

Brandom, a University of Pittsburgh
Distinguished Service Professor of
Philosophy, is one of four recipients of
the Mellon Distinguished Achievement

_ Award from the Andrew W. Mellon

Foundation. This award, established in
2001, will provide Brandom with $1.5

, million in grants, one of the largest grants

given worldwide for individual academic
achievement. .
Brandom, who received his doctorate
in philosophy from Princeton in 1977, has
worked in Pitt’s philosophy department
since 1976. He currently teaches courses
about the German philosophers Georg

Hegel and Gottlob Frege and- on the
philosophies of mind and language.

He explains that philosophy, particu-
larly the study of how humans u/selan-‘
guage, is part of our “self understanding,”

adding -that people are “interested in _

everything from what makes language
possible to what language makes -possi-
ble.”

Brandom is also a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences
and served as a Fellowof the Center for
the Advanced Study of the ‘Behavioral
Studies at Stanford Universityrfrom 2002
to 2003. He has written six books’ and
numerous articles on the philosophies of
language, logic and the mind, but he is,
perhaps, most renowned for his 1994
book, “Making It Explicit: -Reasoning,
Representing, and \ Discursive
Commitment,” which~explains the con-

In an otherwise unassuming coffee
shop in Shadyside, Lee Gutkind sat in a

brown chair in the middle of the store. He’

certainly wasn’t relaxing. He sat, dis-
cussing one of a multitude of his projects
with Tiki, a woman from his “Creative

- Nonfiction” journal, which is regarded in

the writing community as the first and

now’ most distinguished literary maga-

zine devoted to creative nonfiction.

“You can find Lee there often,” said
friend and colleague Bruce Dobler. “He
always stays to his schedule.” .

Lee wakes up at 4:30 a.m. every day
and begins writing. “I’m always Working
on something,” he said.‘ “Maybe it’s a
sequel to ‘Forever Fat [Essays by the
Godfather],’ or the immersion into robot-
ics I’m working on at [Carnegie Mellon
University], or even just a“ personal
essay.” Gutkind‘ also claims to be the first
one to get coffee at Starbucks, which

V opens at 6,a.m. A

’ At 7 a.m., he takes a break fromhis
strict regimen to wake his son, Ben. From
there, they head to Ritter.’s.Diner at about
7:30 a.m. and have breakfast before Ben
goes to school.‘ '

After that, break time is over.
Gutkind continues to write until about 11
am., at which point he usually focuses on
the “Creative. Nonﬁction Journal.” After
that, he might move on to any of a num-
ber of activities.

“One thing about Lee is that he is

modest.‘ He could be just back from
Geneva, [Switzerland,]t and you would
never know,” Dobler said. “I wouldn’t
have known of half of his accomplish-
ments if they weren’t listed on his Web
site.” A A

Gutkind maintains a Web site for his.

journal at creativenonﬁction.org.

When he’s not creating and main-
taining a whole new genre of writing,
Gutkind works for his Alma Mater, Pitt.
As- the former director of the writing pro-

gram and current professor, Gutkind .
keeps himself involved in many aspects

"of writing. “There isn’t anything: else in
the world that made, me happy.”

“When I was editor of The Pitt
News, Lee [Gutkind] did a lot to help
keep the paper independent,” said Cris
Hoel, who, among other things, is an
attorney who represents The Pitt News.
“He didn’t need three Ivy League degrees
to make a difference. Lee is more accom-
plishments, not pedigree.” ,

In fact, Lee grew up in Pittsburgh, in

. ‘the neighborhoods of Greenfield and
Squirrel Hill. As a kid, he was picked on '

for being overweight. “For my bar mitz-
vah, I had to get «a size 44 wool suit,”
Gutkind recalled. “I realized I was bigger
than all‘of the elders, and they were five
times my age.” ’

P Gutkind left for the National Guard

in Atlantic" City, N.J., not long after high
school — which he “left at 230 pounds.”

In his book, “Forever Fat,” he recounted
the abuse one blackcompatriot received
from a racist drill sergeant, and how that
inspired him to overcome his own strug-
gles. .

“I came slim with a ﬂat-top hair cut,”
Gutkind said. “I could never get my hair
to stick up before. I was a new man.”

After his term of service, Gutkind
chose to follow his dream of riding
around the country on a motorcycle.
Soon after, he turned that experience into

a book, titled “Bike Fever, An
Examination ' of the Motorcycle
Subculture.” I

Gutkind received. his bachelor’s
degree in general studies from Pitt and
has been a teacher here since 1970.
Throughout his career, he has written
several books, including “The Art of

Brandom plans to fund
many projects with grants

Brandom, page 1

nections between mathematical and
anthropological studies of languages. He
is currently working on a book entitled
“The Spirit of Trust,” an analysis of
Hegel’s “The Phenomenology of Spirit.”

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
released a statement describing Brandom
as “one of the most creative philosophers
of language and mind working today.
“Making It Explicit,” [Harvard
University Press, 1994], his first book, is
regarded as a leading contribution to
understanding the nature of -norms, rules,
and commitments in thought and action
— one of the most pressing problems in
philosophy and the social sciences, and
has been compared to landmark works
from the previous generation of philoso-
phers.”

Brandom explained that he plans to
use the funds from the award on several
projects, including hiring a professional
archivist to catalog the papers of Wﬂﬁid
Sellars, whom he described as “the
Pittsburgh philosopher” and “one of the
greatest philosophers of the 20th centu-
ry.”_Se1lars worked at Pitt from 1963 until
his death in 1989 and wrote “Empiricism

and the Philosophy of Mind.” By orga—
nizing these works, which are now in_ the
Archive of Scientific Philosophy at
I-Iillman Library, Brandom hopes to ready
them for scholarly use.

“His presence in the philosophy
department, more than anything else,
marked us as a world—class department,”
Brandom said of Sellars.

Brandom said that he hopes to use
part of the award money to bring visiting
lecturers here to Pitt.

He will also use some of the funds to
take three years off from his administra-
tive and undergraduate teaching responsi-
bilities to prepare for the John Locke
Lectures he will give at Oxford
University in 2006. This lecture series,
entitled “Saying and Doing,” will focus
on the “contemporary hard-core philoso-
phy of language,” he said. He added that
he also hopes to use some of-the grant

money to bring the John Locke Lectures"

here to Pitt for his colleagues and his post-
doctoral students to enjoy.

“I have spent my entire career in the
philosophy department at the University
of Pittsburgh —— a department that has
consistently been recognized as one of the
top ﬁve in the nation,” Brandom said.

Gutkind called the “godfather behind creative nonfiction”

Gutkind, page 1

Creative Nonfiction,” “The Best Seat in Baseball, But
You Have to Stand!” and “The People of Penn’s Woods
West.” He also has a Web site, www.leegutkind.com.
But there was one moment that really stands out in his
career. “It changed my life in many ways,” he said.

In 1996, on an otherwise normal day, Gutkind
received a call from a» friend, who directed him to the lat-
est copy of Vanity Fair. In this magazine, writer James
Wolcott declared Gutkind to be the “godfather behind
creative nonﬁction” as part of a rant Wolcott wrote about
his distaste for,modem forms of writing.

“I was embarrassed. I mean, he was attacking me; I

think he even called me a human octopus,” Gutkind’

recalled. “I had been writing for years, but this was a

wake-up call for me. I went from being a writer whose
work no one reads to the godfather. I also learned that,
while good publicity is good, bad publicity is also good.”

After that, there was nowhere to go but up. Gutkind
has given speeches and workshops in Paris, Australia
and Geneva, and at Harvard. He has even appeared on
ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“If you want a role model as a writer, this is him,”
Dobler said. “He’s a pro.”

As a teacher at Pitt, Gutkind is involved in all
aspects of the curriculum, building the largest and most
competitive masters of the fine arts, MFA, for creative
nonfiction in the country. “He’s a very serious and
demanding teacher because it’s a serious and demanding
world,” Dobler said. “He means it [writing] to be a
lifestyle.” I

Gutkind had such an impact on people that a
Pittsburgh city council member got a resolution passed
making the week of Nov. 2 “Creative Nonﬁction Week”
because he had enjoyed Gutkind’s book “Forever Fat.”

“I started out wanting to write ﬁction,” Gutkind said,
“but I didn’t think I had experienced life enough to do it
well, so I wanted to spend time in the world.”

Dobler elaborated on Gutkind’s ability by discussing
an experience Gutkind had while writing “Many
Sleepless Nights: the World of Organ Transplantation,” a
look into the world of organ donors.

“When Lee [Glutkind] was working on that book, he
did everything with the doctor,” he said. “He was in
scrubs, he was even handed a clamp once. He gave it
back, I believe, but it just goes to show you how well he
blended in. He was a perfect ‘ﬂy on the wall.”’

Executing the artificially sane in Ark.

On Tuesday night, the state of
Arkansas miscarried justice in an
irrevocable way.

Charles Singleton, a 44-year-
old schizophrenic man, was execut-
ed by lethal injection after being
forced to take enough anti-psychot-
ic medication to render him sane
enough to be killed.

The Supreme Court has stated
that it is unconstitutional to execute
the mentallyill if they are not capa-
ble of comprehending what is about
to happen and why.

A lower court ruled that forcing
medication on Singleton was appro-
priate and allowed for his execu-
tion, and the Supreme Court let that
ruling stand.

Essentially, Singleton has been
kept artificially sane while on death
row. Without the drugs, he had
reported demons and demon blood
in his cell.

These are not the notions of a
sane man, a man fit to be executed
by established Constitutional prece-
dent.

While the ideological argument
on the morality of the death penalty
rages, there can be little doubt from
either side that the execution of the
profoundly mentally ill is a barbar-
ic practice.

It is inhumane by any standard.

g If Singleton required forced
administration of psychotropic

drugs to render him “sane enough”
for execution, he clearly belonged
in a state hospital, not on death row.

Singleton was a murderer. He
stabbed his victim to death.

There is no doubt that he was
incapable of functioning in normal
society. .

He belonged someplace where
he would be unable to hurt himself
or anyone else, and he deserved
health care. The care he got, being
forced to be a candidate for execu-
tion, was a travesty.

The mentally ill are misunder-
stood in American culture. Few
people can comprehend what it is
like to be schizophrenic, to have
torments come from inside.

The American public often fears-
and loathes those who are different.
Singleton’s execution could further
fuel misconceptions of the mentally
ill as dangerous elements of society
that must be disposed of.

Disposal of “different” people
echoes the most loathsome chapters
of human history.

On the positive side, perhaps
Singleton needn’t have died entire-
ly in vain.

Perhaps enough people will be
outraged at the illegal murder of an
incompetent person that a great hue
and cry will be raised.

Perhaps this unfortunate event
need not be repeated. -

The city looks squashed. Blue
tarps covered gaping holes on a
smattering of roofs in every neigh-

months of cleaning the yard, my
parents still have a giant "root ball

My family greeted me with sto-
ries of trees crashing around them,
the noise barely audible over the

storm winds. I saw jun-

the people who were
killed when they went

I don’t think we’re in
Virginia anymore, Toto

Strohm, page 6

um had killed him, I became con-
vinced that I had narrowly escaped
a deathly illness — five times. After
Henson’s death and my revelation, I
began to pay attention to every ill-
ness I heard discussed and won-
dered if each would be the next one
to threaten my life.

My mom seems to have gone
through a similar experience. She
began watching The Weather
Channel’s “Storm Stories.” The
show ‘presents true stories in which
families were ripped apart, friends
slain and property destroyed by var-
ious natural disasters —— all to dra-
matic background music. With each
story, my mother learns about
another violent danger waiting to
kill the people she loves quicker
than you can say, “The sky looks
kinda funny.” -

I imagine that one particularly
poignant story was responsible for
the Christmas gift that resurfaced
many times this season. My aunt,
boyfriend, brother and father are
now proud owners of their own per-
sonal car hammers, thanks to my

mom. Never again will we be stuck
in the bottom of a lake or river,
unable to break a window and
escape the jammed doors of the car.

It’s no wonder I’m becoming a
paranoid person. I can no longer
assume that, ifI avoid coastal cities
and California, I’ll be safe from any
imaginable harm nature can send at
me. The threat lies in wait, and I
have no way of knowing how it will
strike.

Sure, Pittsburgh seems safe
from volcanic eruptions, but just
wait until the lava is at your door.

But I’m not worried. I’m sure
our engineers will soon create some
device to ward off lava and ash.

And when they do, I know my
mom will buy one for everyone in
the family.

J. Elizabeth Strohm is grateful that
her mother loves her enoughto
worry about natural threats that-
might strike Pittsburgh. If she ever
drives into a body of water, she’ll
thank her mother and retract every
hammer joke she's made in the past
two weeks. Share stories of para-

Nordenber ’s raise shameful in light
of current udget crunch

Dear Editor:

In a better time, long ago, those who served in
positions such as chancellors at publicly ‘funded
universities did so with a great degree of altruism,
the rewards of public service and accomplishment
being far more important than the financial rewards
and fringe benefits of the position.

Sadly, in today’s world, things are quite differ-
ent, as we learn with each public notice of the
obscene compensation packages afforded Pitt

."Chancellor Mark Nordenberg.

By every account, Chancellor Nordenberg is a
bright, highly intelligent, educated, dedicated,
industrious, hard—working chancellor, whose pres-
ence has benefited the University and the
University community immensely. .

Notwithstanding his unquestioned talent, how-
ever, where does reasonableness and fairness come

into the salary and benefits picture?

When one heads a public university which con-
sistently increases tuition, which always has its
hand. in the pockets of state taxpayers for massive
subsidies, and through its tax-exempt status, seeks
every benefit which companies in private industry
do not have available to them, when does a certain
amount of compensation become excessive?

Few would argue that Chancellor Nordenberg
does not deserve a comfortable living, an amount
of compensation that places him far above that of
most Americans. - ‘

His salary, however, has just been increased to
in excess of $400,000 per year, and he is provided
a benefits package that is the envy of those of us
who do not reside in a world of fantasy.

Few would contend that he is owed the life of
a king, particularly at the expense of students and
taxpayers who are subsidizing it.

Particularly at a time when the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania is sending the chilling message
that there is not adequate money available to fund

 

true regional assets, our public libraries, it is ,

shameful that the state stands fully behind paying
an amount of compensation to Nordenberg which is

a disgraceful affront to all of us who contribute to T

It.

Dating back to the disgraceful reign of greedy
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, Pitt University boards
have consistently demonstrated, that they will
always be inclined to expectorate in the face of Pitt

' students and state taxpayers by providing shameful

compensation packages to university chancellors.

It then becomes incumbent on the Chancellor
to say, “Enough is enough; I am not going to take
any more money.” '

Shame on Nordenberg for not having the
decency to diffuse this highly charged. issue by act-
ing honorably, and accepting a salary which is not
only fair and reasonable to him, but.to those who
fund it.

Burton’s

Big Fish
Starring Ewan McGregor, Alison
Lohman, Albert Finney, Jessica
Lange, Billy Crudup, Danny
DeVito,. He|ena Bonham Carter
Directed by Tim Burton
i‘ri‘rii‘r1/2

The role of the storyteller has
never been as whimsically and ele-
gantly portrayed in a film as it is in
Tim Burton’s latest, “Big Fish.” And
while the film celebrates the story-

teller, the film becomes almost an
allegory of how storytelling has

been forgotten in that most magical

of mediums, cinema.

Edward Bloom (Albert Finney in
the present and Ewan McGregor in
flashbacks) is dying. He’s lived a
full life, married the woman of his
dreams and has traveled the world.
But the one thing he wants most, a
relationship with his estranged son
Will (Billy Crudup), is something he
might not be able to have. They
haven’t talked in years, mostly out
of his son’s annoyance with he sees
as his father’s tall tales. For him, the
looming passing of Edward signals
the last time he’ll have the chance to
have the record set straight.

Edward’s travels have taken him
from a life as a “big fish” in his
small—town pond to working as a
carnival hand — where he first set
eyes on his soul mate Sandra
(Jessica Lange in the present, Alison
Lohman in flashbacks) —— living the
life of a paratrooper in the Korean
War and working as a traveling
salesman.

Such experiences might seem
anything but uncommon on their
own, but every story has its fair
share of colorful characters and
places to make them remarkable.
There’s the giant who “terrorizes”
Edward’s small town, the impish,
bombastic werewolf who runs the
carnival (Danny DeVito), the small
town out in the woods populated by
its fair share of interesting charac-
ters —— including a poet-turned-bank
robber whom Edward meets during a
stop in a small town during his trav-
eling salesman days and a woman
living in a dilapidated old house,
who may or may not be the witch he
claims to_ have encountered in his
youth.

‘ These stories, as visualized by
Burton, are indeed outrageous. But

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

they are never unbelievable. When
Edward talks of meeting a giant,

chances are the “giant” wasn’t quite .

so monstrous. But in a small,
Southern town in the ‘40s, anyone
much taller than six feet might be
seen as ghastly, with plans to terror-
ize the town. But hearing these fan-
tastic stories as Edward relates them
to his son, from the time he was a
young boy to the married father-to-
be he is now, becomes bittersweet,
because his son won’t allow the
magic of the tales to reenter him. He

becomes the naysayer, the skeptic”

who thinks his father was having an
affair during the weeks and months
he was on the road as a “salesman,”
not wanting to believe he was in fact
helping to save a small town lying in
ruin.

Burton directs the film with the
necessary whimsy the stories
require. Take the scene in which
Edward first sees Sandra at the car-
nival. Time stops, as does everyone
in the tent except for Edward and
Sandra. He tries to walk to her, but
in his way are people and popcorn
kernels thrown in the air. The use of
the stop—time effects made famous
by “The Matrix” have never been
used to such an emotional end.
Burton creates for the audience what
it must be like to have love hit you
square between the eyes. Burton

knows it’s not enough to just say “I‘

saw the woman I was going to
marry.” You have to show it. Burton

COURTESY COLUMBIA PICTURES

does this with a magic and charm
that flows throughout the entire film.

’ But while he injects this into the
film, you have to think that Burton is
atoning for the misstep that was
“Planet of the Apes.” A film of style
over substance, it tied his hands, not
allowing himto make the character-
and plot-driven films that are his

best, like “Edward Scissorhands”

and “Ed .Wood.” And though “Big
Fish” contains typical Burton'ele-
ments -— freakish outcasts, unbe-
lievable situations ‘and an embrace
of both — it seems as though he
made the film to show moviegoers

that he hasn’t forgotten the impor-

PAGE 10

latest fil iquite the catch

’ tance of stories and how.a good sto-

ryteller can‘ turn the mundane into

‘magic. Edward is such a storyteller,

as is Burton. And when“ the credits
roll, Edward Bloom might as well be
a cinematic representation of Burton
himself, fighting for the importance
of telling a good story ‘in a world
made cynical by fakery and cheap
bangs for big bucks. A .

Of course, all of this says noth-
ing of the performances. McGregor

‘ is, as always, on top of his game, /
and he’s dead-on as a young Albert ‘

Finney. But what this film shows is
McGregor’s knack for picking inter-
esting, diverse projects. From
“Velvet Goldmine” and
Rouge” to “Down With Love” and
now “Big Fish,” he has shown a
range and ability not present in
many other actors of his generation.

The other ‘ actors, Lohman,
DeVito, Bonham Carter and Finney,
are just ’ as. good as McGregor,
despite being pushed to more sup-
porting roles. Lange, unfortunately,
is underused in the film. It would
have been interesting to see more of
her character than we do, but it’s not
to be. ..

“Big Fish,” thanks to this acting

. work and the wonderful direction of

Burton, is one of the better films
from 2003, standing out brightly in a
crowded multiplex of loud clunkers
and explosive duds.

“Big Fish” opens in Pittsburgh the-
aters Friday. ' ‘

Commencing in 2003-04, based on the recommendations of the Enrollment Management

Steering Committee and Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies and Dean of Students Jack L.
Daniel, Provost James V. Maher allocated $25,000 per academic year for the Provost’s Book .

students who entered the University of Pittsburgh without a major scholarship, but go on to excel
academically and serve the campus community or the city. Students applying for an award are V
required to document their outstanding service to the University’s Pittsburgh campus community
or to the city, high academic achievement, and ﬁnancial need. Applicants must be currently
enrolled as full-time undergraduate students at the Pittsburgh campus, have earned a minimum of
30 credits at the Pittsburgh campus, and have a minimum 3.25 cumulative grade point average.

The Provost’s Book Fund will award 25 full-time undergraduate students a total of $1,000 each

enjoyable, dynamic and visually stunning
of the “Super Mario Bros.” games for the
NES. Gone were the clunky controls and
indefinite characteristics of the Mario
Brothers from the -first game. Replacing
them were tight controls that gave gamers
a better grasp on the action and the charac-
ter designs allowed you to make out
Mario’s pudgy face and odd-looking mus-
tache. 1

And he could ﬂy! Not only could he
get big and shoot ﬁreballs, but now Mario
could take to the skies to do battle with ﬂy-
ing Goombas and Koopa Paratroopers.

In nearly every way possible, “Super
Mario Bros. 3” was not only one of the

best games for the NES, but one of the best,

video games to ever be released for any
system. And if this most recent incarnation
proves anything, it’s that none of its fun
and allure has been lost since it was
released during the heyday of the NES.
Nintendo has taken the game and
improved certain aspects here and there for
the’ “Super Mario Advance 4” release. The
graphics have been tweaked, along with
the sound, to make it feel more like a Super

NES game and to make the, transition to"

“Super Mario‘ World” a little easier. But
this change isn’t blasphemous. -Instead, it
makes the game more appealing and
dynamic than it was before and gives. long-_

‘ time fans of the game new environments to

ooh and ahh over. _

5 Another positive change is one that
might sound trivial to non-fans — you can
get more than 99 lives. In the NES version,
there were areas where players could use

some nifty moves and tricks to rack up the '

extra lives, like jumping on the three skele-
ton Koopa Troopas in the first castle in
World ' 2. But after a while, doing this
becomes pointless — you can’t get more

than 99 1-Ups. That’s. all_ changed. In ,

“Advance 4,” you can get as many lives as
your playing allows. It makes the game
that much more fun when you’re trying to
get as many lives as possible wiﬂiout rim-
ning out of tirne in the level. ‘

The last major update to “Super Mario
Bros. 3” is that you can now save your
game and come back to it. If there was one

- lmock against the original, it was that you

had to beat the game in one sitting. It was
daunting, and if you had to shut it olf in the
middle of the game for homework or din-
ner, you’d have to start all over again. No
more of that. ' '
“Super Mario Advance 4” is a mar-

velous game that shows off Nintendo’s'

commitment to not only move into the
future, but also remember and bring along
its past. And they are succeeding better
than any ‘fan of Nintendo could have

' hoped. Just look at this game. Whoever

said you can’t improve on perfection has-
n’t played “Super Mario Advance 4.”

PS0 has been

opened up to
young people

' PSO, page 11

classical music. . p

In these introductions, he even
went so far as to encourage audi-
ence participation.‘ For example, he
told an anecdote about the premiere

of the Mozart piece in Paris and '

how the audience burst into
applause in the middle of the piece.
Sandow wanted the audience to do
the same. Loud, enthusiastic
applause and cheers came from
every corner of Heinz Hall, jockey-
ing with. the performing orchestra

for the loudest sounds in the audi- ,

torium. But the orchestra wasn’t

put off by this. In fact, they looked

like they were having as much fun
as the audience. _

This wasn’t your grandparents’
symphony.

The night ended with the scher-
zo of Dmitry - Shostakovich’s
“Symphony No. 10 in E Minor,
Opus 93” and a breathtaking per-
formance of Maurice Ravel’s epic
“Bolero.” In case the audience did-
n’t catch it early on in the evening,

these two pieces, performed so

masterfully by the PS0, demon-
strated why they are known and
recognized as one of the greatest

. orchestras in the world.

The second installmentlin the
“Symphony with a Splash” series,
“Classical Covers,” happens on
Thursday. Once again hosted by
Sandow and conducted by Meyer,
the program includes music by J.S.
Bach and Leopold Stokoski
(“Toccata in D-Minor”), Modest
M.ussorgsky (“Pictures at an

Exhibition”), Todd Levin (“Blur”)’

and Philip Glass (“Heroes

Symphony”).

“Symphony with a Splash” is a

-wonderful program for younger

people who want to give the PS0 a
listen without having to. worry
about many of the formalities of
going to a “normal” performance.

And like the first installment,-

Thursday’s performance will surely
be a memorable one.

Orangewomen
squash Panthers

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers’ Big East
Conference opener was a nail-biter
throughout the first half, but when the
chips were down, Syracuse handed Pitt its
second conference loss of the season.

After Jessica Allen’s three—pointer
early in the second half, the Lady Panthers
found themselves trailing by only a single
point, but it was all downhill ﬁom there.

Syracuse went on a few scoring runs
to win 71-51.

Syracuse guard Julie McBride led all
players in scoring with 24 points. Head
coach Agnus Berenato believes that
rebounding kept Pitt in the game, but
turnovers proved to be the pitfall. .

“We outrebounded them by 10,” she
said. “That’s what kept us in the game. We
outrebounded them, but what kept us from
being in the lead was our turnovers. We
had 12 turnovers.’-’

After shooting 62.5 percent from
three—point range in the ﬁrst half, the Lady
Panthers were a dismal 20 percent in the
second. LaToya Kincaid led all Pitt play-
ers in scoring with nine points.

Berenato stressed the fact that the
team is greatly disadvantaged without

point guard Amy Kunich in the lineup.
Kunich has been sidelined with a foot
injury and is not expected to be able to
retumto action for quite some time.

“It’s a minimum four-to-six-week
injury,” Berenato said. “Even when she
comes back, it will take another two
weeks for her to just be able to [bear
weight]. I’m thinking another mon .”

While last night’s loss was disap-
pointing, Berenato still has conﬁdence that
her team will be able to bounce back She
always expects to get the most out of her
players, and believes that a Big East
Tournament berth is within reach.

“Our goal is to get to the tournament,”
Berenato said. “I think, probably, if you
would have asked me at the beginning of
the season, my goals would have been to
win a game, because I didn’t think we’d
win a game. And that’s not being negative,
that’s just being realistic. And I’m very
realistic. But we’ve won some games now,
so now I’m going to get greedy. And now
my goal is to get to the Big East
Tournament.”

“But Syracuse and Pitt, we’re at the
bottom. And we’ve got to beat somebody.
So we’ve got Providence on Saturday. It’s

Pitt women stop Princeton’s streak with a win

BRIAN GOLDMAN

Staff Writer ~

\ ,

Participating in a dual meet for the ﬁrst time in over a ’

month, the Pitt women’s swimming and diving team ended
Princeton’s 47-meet winning streak, defeating the Tigers
165-135 to improve to 4-1 on the season- The Princeton

’ women’s team had not lost a dual meet since the 1997-98
season.

“We didn’t focus on [the streak],’’ head coach Chuck
Knoles said. “When I informed the girls of their streak, the
girls just said ‘oh well.’’’ '

An unexpected win for the Panthers, which propelled
them to victory, was the performance of senior Sarah Grant
Grant, who had placed fourth on PitI’s team in the 200-
meter breaststroke, won the event by a shocking .47 seconds
to give the Panthers the full nine ﬁrst-place points.

Pitt also had a one—two ﬁnish in the 200-meter freestyle.
Senior Carolyne Savini ﬁnished .7 seconds ahead of team-
mate Kristin Brown to win the event. Brown also won the
100-meter freestyle, while Savini also placed ﬁrst in the
200-meter backstroke and won a third event, the 200-meter

individual medley by .03 seconds over her teammate,
Jennifer Koch. ‘

Princeton dominated the two diving events, winning’

30 of the 38 possible points, but the Panthers won 157 of the
262 swimming events, capped by a win in the meet’s ﬁnal
event. The team of Brown, Jenny Livingstone, Kelly
Redcay and Savini won the 400-meter freestyle relay with a
time of 3:23:01. ,

“The women are making a big impact on the confer-
ence this year,” Knoles said ‘They proved they are a
powef’ S _

The No. 17 Pitt men’s swimming and diving team
defeated No. 23 Princeton by the slimmest of margins
Monday to improve to 4-1 on the season. .~

The diving team was a big key to the Panthers’ victory.
In both diving events, the Panthers earned a clean sweep —
ﬁrst, second and third place. Sophomore Dennis Nemtsanov
placed ‘ﬁrst in both the one- and three—meter dive.

“It was nice to see us perform so Well,” head coach

Chuck Knoles said. “The divers ﬁnishing one-two-three

was big.”

Pitt continued to dominate early inthe meet as the 200- _
meter relay team of Eric Bugby, Randy Gertenbach, Jason -
'Miller and Darryl Washington placed ﬁrst with a time of

1:33:40. Meanwhile, senior Eric Limkemann won the
10()0—meter freestyle event by more then seven seconds.

The Tigers began battling back later in the meet. Justin
Chiles got Princeton back on track with his victory in the
200-meter freestyle. The Tigers were able to ﬁnish ﬁrst and
second in the 200-meter butterﬂy and eam a win in the 50-
and 100-meter freestyle events.

Freshman Jeﬁ Lcath helped hold back the Tigers’ run

with wins in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke.’

Limkemann also won his second event later in the meet,

winning the 500-meter freestyle. . V .

Coach embarrassed by loss

Basketball, page 14

a new day, and we just: go right back at it.
It doesn’t get any easier.”

John and Gertrude Petersen, along
with President of the Alumni Association
Eva Bloom, joined Berenato on the bench
as honorary coaches. Although Berenato
had hoped for a better outcome, she was
honored to have the trio join her on the
bench. i

‘‘I’m embarrassed now, because we
lost by 20 points,” Berenato said. “But to
be honest with you, it was all inspiring for
me. I don’t think they realize how people
look at them, and the respect that they

command. I know that my team was real-
ly excited to have them, as well as Eva
Bloom, on the bench. And again, I think
it’s my job to bring [the team] great role
models and to show them where a degree
can get them.”

Berenato feels that the team is suffer-
ing from lack of conﬁdence. She said the
team is a lot better than it thinks, and as
soon as the players realize it and stop
focusing on the mistakes, that is when the
wins will come.

The Lady Panthers will be back in ' ‘

action this Saturday when they play host
to Providence. Tip-off is scheduled for 2
p.m.
