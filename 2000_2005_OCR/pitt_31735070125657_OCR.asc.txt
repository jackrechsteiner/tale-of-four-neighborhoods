l)r. Curtiss Porter, a founding member of Pitt’s
Black Action Society, challenged the current BAS to
understand the context of their generation at Friday’s

‘ \ Annual BAS Indaba at the Union.

“Where is your world going, and what is its rela-
tionship with the past and future?” he asked.

Porter began his presentation with a libation, the
ancient tradition of pouring water to the earth in
honor of something. It was an opportunity to connect
with ancestors of all black people. Porter then

recalled a more recent past: the founding of BAS in ,
»l968. '

“The Black Action Society was formed out of the

if spirit,“we must do something,”’ he said.

Porter said black consciousness--reached a high

‘level because blacks struggled to peacefully resolve

issues of beingstrangers in the United States. He
added that this resolution became impossible when
Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.

He encouraged his audience to ask themselves
what they should be doing in today’s world as a
young person with an education.

Other speakersof the evening included LaKeisha
Wolf and Sharleen Morris, former Penn State Black
Caucus executive board members.

Wolf told Indaba attendees how she was targeted
by anonymous hate- mail circulating through Penn
State’s main campus. She hid under hooded‘ sweat-
shirts, bulletproof vests and large security guards
throughout the 2000-2001 school year. '

The two Penn/ State grads took turns reading let-

   f H1ca11S.0nb1aCk Stud6I1tSt0 Create community

ters ridden with death threats and derogatory name-
calling. One letter"depicted the murder of a black
man on campus. A week after the letter was received,
Morris said the decaying body of an unidentiﬁed

' black man was found nearby.

“I cannot describe the psychological effect it has
on a person to fear for your life at this prestigious
school,” Wolf said.  '

Pitt student Jason Flint said that a great deal of
apathy exists within the black community.

“We don’t have a black community at Pitt,” he
said. “Black people at this campus don’t really com-
municate with each other.”

ShaDonna Jackson, a student at Pitt—Titusvi1le,
said her campus, which is located in a predominately

Sebastian Albu, a member of the band Esquevez, plays guitar on the William Pitt Union
porch. Esquevez played as part of the Business Student Council’s picnic yesterday.

On any Oakland Sunday

Weekly bustle takes a break for lazy afternoons

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
The PittNews ' A

Oakland on Sunday is quiet.

Traffic on Fifth and Forbes
avenues has slowed to an occasional
car orbus. There are only four people
on the benches outside Towers, and
even the oft-rowdy. Ashtray is barren
and quiet.

One Pitt freshman, Joe Scarfutti, is
on his way to Eddie’s for lack of any-
thing else to do’. ; ‘

‘‘I’m . going shopping with the
meal blocks that I haven’t used for
food that I won’t eat,” he says.

A few students are spread lazily
across the Cathedral lawn, taking
advantage of the warm weather for a
combination of study and recupera-
tion.

“Sunday is a day to get ahead for
the next week, study and sleep in,”
says Ayo Adebiyi a transfer student
from Alabama A&M University.

Across Bigelow Boulevard, one
spot of life for the Pitt campus thrives
on the patio of the William Pitt Union.
Gathered on the grass and at the tables
surrounding the patio are about 40
spectators for the musical act
Esquevez.

The band plays at the fourth aImu-
al picnic for the Business Student
Council, but most picnickers are not
business students. Many, in fact, are
not even students at all but friends of
the band.

The Business Student Council
holds a picnic every year to orient
freshmen and transfers with the vari-
ous parts of the business department.

_ Keri Buchanan, the chairman of
the Business Student Council, says the
picnic is designed to bridge the gap
between business students and the
department.

“[The picnic] is mainly geared
toward getting freshmen business stu-
dents out here to meet the faculty, staff
and organizations,” Buchanan says.
“We had some faculty and two of the
deans are here.”

But this year, Buchanan says,
opening day football and a housing
fire alarm cut into attendance.

 “Normally there are more business
students,” Buchanan says. “But we’re
battling the Steelers game and evacua-
tion of business ﬂoors in Tower B. It
was a good turnout considering the
adversity.”

Not everyone in attendance is a
business major.

“I just wandered by,” says student
Beth Depalma. “It was a happy sur-
prise. I just kinda snagged their food.”

A crowd of smoking and dancing
fans shout joking requests for “I Will
Survive” and catcalls of “Pomo!” and
“Uno mas” at Esquevez, who play a
set that includes psychedelic/funk cov-
ers of “Psycho Killer” by the Talking
Heads and “Take 5” by Dave Brubeck.

It’s the first appearance at the
Union for the band.

“We’ve played at the Scottish
games before,” says keyboardist Jim
Merenda. “But this is the first time
we’ve played on the patio. A lot of
these people have come to our other
shows, but there are a lot of new faces
also. People just wanna come out and
have a good time.”

Staff wake}  T

p The ﬂashing Violet light is visi-  
 b1e_ from, blocks away in the dark

Oakland night. The light nears and it

,‘is almost impossible not to look,
J,"-"dirfectly at the blinking while enter- '
‘i-T-‘Ting the bus. It_ looks‘-.1-ike a tour bus
cut in "half, featuring}-.padded ‘seats

and wide aisles, but no riders.

; The Ultraviolet Loop is a 21-seat V

luxury bus that is free to ride for any-

cone in the city. The bus leaves Pitt

and crosses the Monongahela River
on the Birmingham Bridge.’ On
Carson Street in the South Side, the
bus picks up four men in their early-
to mid— 20s.

The guys get in and marvel at the

existence of the bus.
‘ “I was just kidding around ask-
ing this bus for a ride,” says one
dressed in a black polo shirt“ and
dress pants. -

The guys begin to discuss their
night at Smokin’ J oe’s. One remarks,
“There’s booty by the pound,” yet
the men have brought no women
with them.

The group gets off the bus at the
costume shop right before M in the
Strip District. They are grateful for
the lift, and one throws a dollar into
the tip jar;

The bus travels through the Strip
and past Bar Pittsburgh, which is
hosting a live band on a stage erect-
ed outside. » '

Out of the Strip,_ the ride quiets

down. The lull of the tires on asphalt ‘

and the engine’s gears turning is
monotonous, until the rattling body
of the bus hits a bump or small hill.

Driver Tom Penny is on his sixth
loop of the evening.

“I’m feeling a little ﬂaky,” Penny
says, noting the empty seats on his
bus. ‘‘I think if it was better publi-
cized, there would be more riders.”

- On the ‘way to Shadyside and
back to Oakland, the bus pulls over
and sits idle at one of its stops. The
five-minute delay is meant to keep
buses on a 20-minute schedule.

The'UV Loop has two stops at

Pitt: Oakland and Fifth avenues, and -

Oakland and Forbes avenues. The
bus then stops in the South Side, the
Strip, Downtown, Bloomfield, East

. Liberty and Shadyside.‘

According to Gloria Forouzan, a
spokeswoman for the loop, the goal
of the bus is to provide people with a

safe mode of transportation that will_ '

get them out of their neighborhoods.

“We don’t strive hard enough'to
make sure that the word is passed on to
our fellow sister or brother,” Jackson
said.

-Abimbola Fakinlede said that to
promote black unity on Pitt’s campus, a
group called FREEDOM, Fundamental
Resources for Educational Enrichment
and Development of Mentors, ﬁghts
for the establishment of a local black
cultural center. The site would be used
for recreational and academic activi-

ties.

“There is a strong correlation
between schools with cultural centers
and higher GPAs,” Fakinlede said.
“Statistics show that Pitt’s black stu-
dents rank last academically. We have a
problem on this campus that we need to
address.”

edly made it further down the cylindrical
building, through Rooms 2001, 1901,
1801 and 1701, and even into Room
1601. .

“I woke up and I thought it was rain-
ing inside,” said James Rinker, a freshman
engineering major who lives in 1601. And
though alarms were already sounding
when Rinker ﬁrst awoke, it wasn’t the
alarms that roused him.

“I didn’t even hear the alarms, I just
woke up ‘cause it sounded like it was rain-
ing in here,” Rinker said. Dozens of stu-
dents conﬁrmed that alarms sounded only
in the hallways, and not in the bedrooms,
making the warning hard to hear.

Though the alarm ﬁrst sounded
sometime before 11 a.m., Anthony
Gualtieri was still in his bedroom well
after noon.

“You can barely hear it, there were at
least 10 people up here at 12:30 [p.m.],”
Gualtieri said. “It wouldn’t wake you up
out of a sleep at all.” But Gualtieri said
other factors contributed to. an unimpres-
sive building evacuation.

“There’s all the fake [alarms], and
then there’s a real one,” Gualtieri said,
referring to what many Tower B residents
said has been a frequent occurrence in the
last two weeks: false ﬁre alarms.

Carolyn Hoffman walked around the
22nd ﬂoor with her jeans rolled up above
her ankles, a preventative measure taken
to preserve the integrity of one of her last
dry pieces of clothing. She recalled recent
ﬁre alarms": one at 7:15 on a Friday mom-
ing, one around 10:30 a.m. on a Saturday,
and others she couldn’t remember as
clearly. '

But Hoffman knew yestcrday’s alarm
was to be taken seriously, a hallway ﬁlled

Monday, September 10, 2001

with yelling residents grabbed her atten-
tion, so she took her glasses and ran
downstairs, dressed somewhat atypically
for a Sunday morning.

Hoffman recollccted the “sheer joy of A
wandering around Pittsburgh in my paja-

mas” as she explained her morning
adventure, traveling from Towers lobby to
CVS Pharmacy, and then to Starbucks.

The athletic training major said she
smelled smoke as she ran out the door, a
story corroborated by a half dozen other
residents. But some students didn’t smell
anything, and Frye didn’t see a ﬁre as she
evacuated the room where the ﬂood
began.

University spokesman Robert Hill
said Pitt has yet to make any determina-
tions about the cause of the spn'nkler’_s
activation. Hill also couldn’t say whether
students who were still inside the building
long after alarms sounded would be
penalized. In the past, students who
ignored ﬁre alarms have. been slapped
with ﬁnes for failure to evacuate a
University building during an emergency.

Hill also couldn’t say whether the
University would be reimbursing students
whose items were damaged as a result of
the ﬂooding.

-Though some students were issued
$20 Pitt Fund credits to assist with laun-
dry costs — a number of Tower B resi-
dents spent yesterday afternoon washing
all the clothing they own — no one was
sure whether any further reimbursements
would be made.

' According to Hill, the building sus-
tained minor damage to the walls in the
rooms below 2201. He said the University
will continue to investigate the exact
nature of any damages as ﬁre ofﬁcials
continue to investigate the reason for the

alarm.

Provost urges black recruitment

Indaba, page 3

' had more to say.

BAS Vice President Kya O’Quinn,
who has attended four Indabas at.Pitt,
said people used to come solely for the
after party. Fifteen minutes past the
party’s scheduled start time, this year’s
attendees were still engrossed in dis-
cussion. O’Quinn said she hopes the
energy will not fade with time.

Dr. Jack Daniel, the vice provost of
academic affairs, interim dean of stu-
dents, chair of the enrollment manage-
ment committee and one of the night’s
speakers, praised the entire black stu-
dent body at Pitt, calling the current
classes “the best-qualified African-
American class in the history of [Pitt].”

“Nevertheless,” Daniel said, “it is
my belief that the University should
continue enhancing its efforts to do

several things with regards to African-
American studies.”

He urged the University to recruit-

academically talented black students,
to work to improve the retention rate of
black students and to increase the num-
ber of black students achieving degrees
in the natural sciences, engineering,
business and health science.

Daniel said the black community at
Pitt has had tremendous success but
they still have miles to go. He stressed
the importance of remembering the
accomplishments of Pitt graduates

such as Albert Wynn, a member of
Congress, and Bebe Moore Campbell, '

a ‘nationally known author.

“We now have Albert Wynns and
Bebe Moore Campbells in just about
every known profession,” Daniel said.
“The question is, how: do "we get
more?”

A sprinkling of disappointment

When freshmen ﬁrst move into Towers,
they should have certain expectations.

They should expect to be conﬁned to
small, pie-shaped rooms for eight months.

They should expect to share a bath-
room with 30 to 40 of their new closest
friends.

They should expect to learn to get along
with someone they’ve never met.

They should expect to live in old, unat-
tmctive buildings. _

They should also expect that the ﬁre
alarms in their buildings will be consistent
and that they will always wake them up.

They should expect that sprinkler sys-
tems will activate when where is an actual
ﬁre and only for the purpose of extinguish-
ing those ﬁres rather than ﬂooding people’s
rooms.

They should expect that their resident
assistants will bang on their doors and let
them know to evacuate.

They should expect that they won’t

" have to evacuate their building for several

hours when a sprinkler activates at the
wrong time without knowing when they can
retum. I

They should expect that when they get
back into their buildings, the elevators will
be functioning and they will not have to
climb several ﬂights of stairs to their soaked
rooms.

Unfortunately, the University did not
fulﬁll some of these expectations yesterday

when Tower B was evacuated after a sprin-
kler activation on’ the 22nd ﬂoor.

Some waited less than others because
they had not heard the alarms or had ignored
them and had not evacuated.

When they returned, they had to climb
the stairs since the elevators did not yet
work

Then they had to assess the damage.
Some had lost valuable notebooks and text-
books they had stored on their ﬂoors. Others
returned to damaged electronic equipment.
The University has not said whether it will
reimburse students for damages.

When a student moves into Towers, he
or she doesn’t have great expectations. But
no matter how bad the accommodations,
every student on campus has the right to
expect the basics — like ﬁre safety. Yesterday
safety’ measures malfunctioned.

But we must remember that even if the
safety precautions are in place, they are not
effective if people don’t follow them. Every
year we hear stories of incidents at other
schools. For example, three Seton Hall
freshmen died in a dormitory ﬁre last year.

The one time you refuse to evacuate is
the one time the alarm could be real.

Don’t let the numbers catch up with
you: ' When there’s an alarm, evacuate the
building. It may be a pain and the alarm may
be false, but isn’t spending a few hours
idling in Eddie’s on a Sunday afternoon bet-
ter than the alternative?

United States shows chauvinism in Durban

BRENTIN Mock
Columnist

I remember an argument with an
old ﬂame where I put my foot down
and declared that certain issues sim-
ply weren’t up for discussion. One
such issue was a case of infidelity on
my part that occurred early in our

’ relationship.

" I had taken the position that since
I had admitted to it, apologized and
vowed never to do it again, that was
the end of it. Our fight was over
Lucky Charms, and she was forbid-
den from somehow weaving my night
of philandering into the mix.

“As the man of the house, I am
entitled to the last of the Lucky
Charms!”

“Oh yeah? And I guess as the man
of the house you think you’re entitled
to other women’s lucky charms too,
don’t you?”

All I could retort to that was,
“End of discussion.”

I truly resented when she did that.
She could bring an argument about
any conceivable thing in the world
back to my act of adultery.

Looking back, though, I see how
all I was really doing wasfbullying my
way through our spat ensuring there
was no way I could come out as a
salty loser. As insensitive as this was,
at least I didn’t have to deal with a
topic for which I had no defense. And
I knew that in any and every quarrel
between us, she would use my one-
night affairas her trump card.

Watching how the United States
rudely excused itself from the UN.

Conference on Racism in Durban,
South Africa, last week reminded me
of my own chauvinistic approach to
debate.

It goes without saying that the
United States did not want to be there
in the first place. So it came as no sur-
prise when it pulled out at the first
hint of disagreement. ‘ ;

Apparently Michael Southwick,’

deputy assistant to the secretary of
state, and his league of low-level
American delegates got upset with the
language used in the "resolution that
equated Zionism with apartheid. A
clash between Israeli and Arab dele-

. gates at the conference appeared

irreconcilable about this matter, and
so the United-States took the high
road and decided to bail with Israel
(and its lobbyists, I bet) following
closely behind. _ ”

I can understand being upset over
this type of labeling. Such banal mea-

sures are counterproductive and mar.

reaching any kind of true accord.

On the other hand,*I can’t under-
stand the United States calling it quits
after the first little squabble that

arose. It’s obvious that the United ‘

States is using this disagreement
between Palestinians and Jews as a
reason to excuse itself from a table at
which it never wanted to sit anyway. I
refuse to believe that an issue of
words on paper is reason enough to
pull out from what potentially could

‘have been one of the most important

world conferences of this era.
Perhaps I would have granted my

Lovin’ Las Vegas: Sin City is absolutely fabulous

CLARE PERRETTA
‘ 'I'he.Pitt News

Nowhere else on earth can you
drive past the Sphinx, the Eiffel Tower
and Lake Como’s dancing fountains on
the way to the world’s highest thrill
ride, be asked if you’d like your toes
shaved during your afternoon pedicure
and dine on lamb chops beneath a real
Picasso — all in the same day.

I’m speaking, of course, about Las
Vegas.

' I can’t ﬁgure out why the protago-
nist of Sheryl Crow’s song “Leaving
Las Vegas” would Want to do such a
thing. Las Vegas is the perfect blend of
schlocky and opulent: In front of my
hotel — in the middle of the high desert
— an imitation Lake Como erupts every
15 minutes with fountains choreo-
graphed to Frank Sinatra and Luciano
Pavarotti songs. Down the street from a
phony, ﬁery volcano, Siegfried and Roy
make gorgeous, irascible white tigers
disappear and reappear nightly with the
power of “Sarmoti!”

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The true Las Vegas experience
begins on the plane ride. An unpleasant
ﬂight makes the very approach into Las

Vegas even more fabulous by compari- .

son. At nighttime, the view from the
plane of the Strip’s glittering lights is

THE PITT NEWS

phenomenal. Last month, my ﬂight left
Philadelphia in a driving rainstorm. I
cowered in my seat as we ﬂew past
clouds ﬂickering inside with crackles of
lightning. I groaned when I tasted my
ﬂavorless, specially—ordered vegetarian
dinner. After my miserable ﬂight
touched down at McCarran
International, I was ready to kiss the
dusty tarmac and devour some barbe-
qued pork chow mein at the chic noodle
bar in.the Bellagio, my hotel.

Once on the ground, trying to ﬁght
the urge to sing Elvis’ magnum opus
“Viva Las Vegas” is useless. Just give
in.

A cab ride down the Strip is an
abbreviated world tour. A black glass
pyramid with a matching sphinx sits
next door to a medieval castle. Three of
the feet of a scale model of the Eiffel
Tower disappear inside the casino and
the canal banks of the Venetian teem
with camera-wielding Japanese
tourists.

Part of Vegas’ special allure was the
rhinestone-covered,
haze of sleaze that covered the town
until the ‘80s. If you wonder where all
the showgirls went, in the mid-‘90s Las
Vegas marketers reinvented the city as a
family destination and not just a lonely,
horny conventioneer’s town. Topless

ex the chance to speak on my unfaith-
fulness only on the premise that she
wouldn’t refer to what I did as “cheat—
ing.”

Make sense?

Jesse Jackson, who attended as a
private citizen, said, “In many ways
the American delegation never
walked in.”

Other countries and civil rights
leaders seem to think, along with
myself, that the Unifed States really
left because it didn’t want to touch
other sticky topics such as an apology
for its involvement in the slave trade
and reparations for slave descendants.

Agreed, Arab-Jewish situations,
apologies and reparations are all suf-
focating topics to discuss — especially
if a resolution is to be found — but
what would one expect from this kind
of conference?

Symposiums such as these are
supposed to tackle the most contro-
versial and difficult tasks. Otherwise,
they may as well be vanity contests to
see who is the most eloquent or who
exudes the most charisma.

In wake of the political "disenfran-

chisement of blacks in Florida, police
brutality and -racial profiling, the
United States needs to be present as
much as any other nation. But we live
in a land where many believe that the
debt to blacks has been paid via wel-
fare and affirmative action — neither
of which blacks are the chief benefi-
ciaries.

But when you feel you’re the
most powerful nation or when you
think you’re the “powerful” one in the
relationship, you give yourself the
liberty to decide what is acceptable
for debate and what isn’t.

Wounds are left open and prob-
lems are left addressed. Another black
driver is pulled over and beaten while
10 more are killed in Jerusalem.

I never really gave my ex—girl—
friend a chance to really talk much
about how she felt about my cheating."
The shame and guilt I felt for doing it
is nothing compared to the pain she
felt with her trust betrayed and her
heart pierced

All I wanted to talk about was
Lucky Charms.

Las Vegas is quickly becoming a
paradise for foodies like me, too. Sure,
stufﬁng yourself at _a buffet on all‘ the
prime riband king crab legs you can
stand is an integral part of the true
Vegas experience, but the sheer number
of ﬁne restaurants is astounding. It’s
like New York, but without the attitude
or the litter.

Case in point: While I sipped my
icy vodka girnlet (Absolut? Ketel One?
The maitre d’ made sure to ask if I had
a preference) and waitedfor my parents
to meet me for dinner at Picasso, the
head chef kindly said hello to me as he-

over the evening’s reservations. '

I’d describe my dinner, but this
isn’t a restaurant review. I will share the
notes I took on my dessert, though:
“My chocolate terrine arrived, bleeding

its bitter chocolate heart out. A scoop of .

melty milk chocolate ice cream lay next
to it, separated by a slash of dark choco-
late sauce. It was like a glamorous,
chocolate ﬂavored crime scene.”

earth is natural scenery of amazing
beauty. -A day car trip through Death

Artist’s Palette and the barren salt ﬂats

Las Vegas is like the world gone
loopy. Complete strangers chat animat-

Roy’s brands of grandiose magic.
Amorous honeymooners snuggle in the
lounges and ignore the clanking of

Wide-eyed preschoolers and preten-

gling of nickels make fools of us all.

“Oh no no  in reality. If I kick the shit out of you, do I get the money?”

Child's play
Travel back to a simpler time at
Pittsburgh Children’s Museum

KATIE MAVRICH
The Pitt News

What has hands, but never washes
them?

_While many college students may
recognize immediately that the
answer is a clock, children visiting the
museum mull it over and over before
they discover the answer. This riddle
and many others grace the exterior of
the 25-foot tall pink “Poodle Sphinx”
who guards the Pittsburgh Children's
Museum.

Walking past a man sleeping on a
bench and up a sidewalk
covered with bright chalk
drawings, stepping into
the North Side’s
Children’s Museum is
akin to traveling back in time. Like
most kids who have grown up in the
Pittsburgh area, I have been to the
museum numerous times. This time I
could actually appreciate it.

On this day, children run all over
the first floor, squealing with excite-
ment. Here, the exhibits allow kids to
climb, learn how pulleys and ropes
work and finger-paint and express
their creative sides at a miniature art
studio.

Upstairs, I enter a room that trans-

ports me directly to a time when the

Roam

only things that mattered were being‘

tucked into bed at night and having
the crusts cut from my peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches. A model of
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood sits
here, complete with X the Owl and
Henrietta Pussycat in their tree and
the castle of King Friday and Queen
Sara.

It is not until I make my way A

downstairs that I am truly fascinated.
An exhibit called “Body Odyssey”
occupies half of the basement. This
interactive exhibit teaches children all
about their bodies and how they work.

Today, the whole lower ,_

level is empty except for
' the echoes of excited
children upstairs.

I sit down at an iMac
and go to work trying to choose foods
that would make a healthy breakfast.
My first try at constructing a balanced
breakfast—— skim milk, a banana, a
poached egg and a bowl of oatmeal ——
results in an inexplicable thumbs
down accompanied by an enthusiastic
“boo” from the computer. On my sec-
ond try, a poached egg, a banana, a
bowl of oatmeal and a glass of orange
juice gain the computer’s approval
and applause. .

Continuing to explore, I learn that
my heart beats 85 times per minute

f and that picking a scab isn’t a good

thing to do after all.

Next I try my luck with another
simulated game, this one called “Body
Battles.” The game requires players to
eliminate the infectious germs from a
boy named Chris so that he can play at
his concert the next night. I find I am
a little better at zapping germs than I
am at choosing healthful meals, and
meet with success on my first try.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Saturday’s runni

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt football team was sup-
posed to have a “soft” opening
schedule, but it underestimated at
least one opponent in South Florida.

The Bulls shocked the Panthers
35-26 Saturday afternoon at Heinz
Field as the Panthers were over-
matched by a program only in its
fifth yearof existence.

“It was a terrible performance
and I take complete responsibility,”
said head coach Walt Harris. “I
don’t have a lot of answers.”

Answers were not to be found as
the 39,452 fans in attendance saw
Pitt waste a solid performance by
quarterback David Priestley,‘ who
threw for 354 yards and three
touchdowns. It was also a career
game for wide receivers R.J.
English — who set new single-
game highs with 135 yards and two
touchdowns — and Lamar Slade,
who also set personal bests with
nine catches and 74 yards. -

South Florida stirred things up
early when it opened the game with
an onside kick, which it then recov-
ered. '

The defense came alive when
Mark Ponko intercepted a pass by
Bulls ' quarterback Marquel
Blackwell, but Pitt could not put
anything together on offense. After
rushing for minus 3 yards, the
Panthers had to punt and South
Florida capitalized by putting
together a scoring drive to take the
early lead.

Faced with third down and 4,
Blackwell hit DeAndrew Rubin
with a pass for 14 yards and the
touchdown. When they regained
possession, the Panthers continued
to try to run the ball but only gained
a few yards. Priestley was ineffec-
tive, throwing two incomplete pass-
es and getting sacked for a loss of
10 yards.

The Bulls answered with a 73-
yard drive to extend their lead to
14-0 as Blackwell connected with
Rubin for the second time for the
touchdown. On the ensuing drive,
Priestley completed two consecu-
tive passes to Lamar Slade, but the
Panthers soon found themselves
faced with third and 12 and could
not gain enough yards for the first

South Florida still defeated the Panthers 35-26 at Heinz Field Saturday.

Pitt unable to contain Blackwell and Rubin

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

The crowd was on its feet; Pitt had closed the gap
to a 28-26 deﬁcit and was one play away from getting
the ball back when DeAndrew Rubin‘ broke Pitt’s

back with a 53-yard reception.

The catch, which came on a third down and 3,
was Rubin’s 11th and final catch of the game and set
South Florida’s offense up on the 3-yard line and pro-

pelled the team to a 35-26 victory.

“When he [Torrie Cox] came up, I knew that he
was going to try to jam me,” Rubin said. “I knew I
had him, so I just put a good move on him, and tried

to get as many yards as I could.”

Rubin finished the day with 144 yards and two

touchdowns as he and South Florida quarterback
Marquel Blackwell worked over the Pitt secondary
throughout the afternoon. .
Blackwell threw the ball 65 times, completing 37
passes for 343 yards and four touchdowns.
Blackwell and Rubin went to work on the
Panthers’ secondary early and often. I
On the Bulls’ first scoring drive, Blackwell con-

with DeAndrew Rubin to tear apart the defense.

‘ nected with Rubin four times for 35 yards, including

a touchdown. After marching the ball down to Pitt’s
14-yard line, Blackwell and company faced a third
down and 4.

After the third down play seemed to break down,
Blackwell’ eluded two Pitt pass rushers and found

Rubin as he lofted a 14-yard strike that Rubin caught
in between two Pitt defenders, putting South Florida
ahead 7-0.

‘‘I rolled out and all I saw was him coming across
the field,” Blackwell said.

“I saw him scramble and I just came back to the
ball,’’ Rubin said.

South Florida head coach Jim Leavitt said he
knew that his offense had to expand the field and that
he was happy with how his offense opened up Pitt’s
defense.

“We knew the free safety [Ramon Walker] was
really aggressive and that he’d come downhill, so we
knew that we’d get in some seams and slants,” Leavitt
said. “I was surprised that they spread out so much to
match our offense.”

After Blackwell moved the offense successfully
on the first scoring drive, he did the same on the ensu-
ing drive, starting at South Florida’s own 27-yard
line.’

South Florida mixed it up on the second scoring
drive, keeping the Pitt defense on its heels as they

10 carries and Jemison collected 16
yards on six carries. ‘

Quarterbacks Rod Rutherford
and David Priestley combined for
13 carries and minus 13 yards,
although those numbers are distort-
ed because they include sacks.

— The offense ran a lot of sets out
of the shotgun, which meant that
almost every time Kirkley took a
handoff or a pitch, he was starting
out 4 yards. behind the line of scrim-
mage. He looked a bit timid coming
out of the backfield, and it didn’t
help that there were no holes to run

Jemison did not look as comfort-

Pitt needs to make changes to win

To get this season back on track,
Pitt needs to change things up a lit-
tle bit. At South Florida’s post-game
press conference, many players said
they were surprised that Pitt didn’t
throw any new looks at them. 4

The Bulls‘ knew’Pitt would load
up the box and‘ blitz a lot. They
knew Ramon Walker was an aggres-
sive safety and that he wouldn’t be

at the deepest part of the field at all

times. And they knew Pitt would not
jam their receivers on the line of
scrimmage;

Is it possible that Pitt took this
game too lightly? Yes. Does Pitt
have a lot of young players at the
skills positions? Yes. Should fans

write this season off because the -'

team lost to South Florida? No.

Pitt still has a lot of talent. The
team'may have come out ﬂat, but
that doesn’t mean the team can’t
rebound when it faces a tough chal-
lenge this weekend. In a matter of
five days, we will all see what kind
of heart and determination this 2001
team has. 4

age in that first half, catching 10 balls
for 91 yards.

“They were playing pretty soft in
the first half and we just picked them
apart,” Rubin said.

Blackwell distributed the ball to
three other receivers, including ﬁve

completions to Ryan Hearn.

He completed 22 of 38 passes for
178 yards and two touchdowns in the
first half.

Blackwell added two more touch-
down strikes in the third quarter, a 13-
yard pass to Hugh Smith and a 22-
yarder to Brian Fisher. ‘

“They didn’t try to jam our
receivers_,” Blackwell said. “They
blitzed almost every down which made
them soft.”

Blackwell put the final exclamation
point on the game in the fourth quarter
when he rolled into the end zone to put
South Florida up for good.

they took advantage of our mis-
takes,” Harris said. “Missing. that
extra point was big.” .

Chances of a Pitt comeback
were short-lived as the Bulls put
together another scoring drive with
the assistance of Pitt penalties near
the goal line. With first and goal at
the 1, Blackwell snuck into the end
zone to put the Bulls up for the final
of 35-26.

 .   Harris pleased with  
~    it way team fought back

“South Florida obviously domi-
nated us,” Harris said. “We weren’t
consistent and got too far behind.”

The Bulls picked up 443_ total
yards as Blackwell competed 37 of

65 attempted passes for 343 yards ‘

and four touchdowns. Rubin had 11
catches for 144 yards to set a new
school record for catches in a game;

The Panthers picked up only 12
rushing yards of a total 383 and
fumbled the ball four times. Pitt
played without star receiver
Antonio Bryant, who missed his
second game with an ankle injury,
and fullback Lousaka Polite, who
hurt his hamstring in practice.

‘‘We '. don’t have all of our
weapons but I’m not making excus-
es,” Harris said. ‘

The players also recognize its
effect on the team. '

“Depth-wise it hurts us because
we were getting tired,” English
said.‘ “But our confidence did not
go down.”

Mike J emison had six rushes for I
16 yards to lead the Panthers’ run- .

ning game while Kirkley had 9
yards on 10 carries. ‘ _

But Harris was pleased with one
aspect of the game — how his team
fought back. But it was apparent
that part of Pitt’s problem was a

' lack of proper preparation.

“We realize it was our prepara-
tion, and we need to practice bet-,
ter,” English said. “People were
thinking that they did enough but
didn’t. I sense it in me, I missed
reads" which means I was not in the
film room enough.”

The question now is how Pitt
will deal with the loss and move on
to next week’s matchup with
Alabama-Birmingham.

“It’s a tough loss but we can
still win every other game,”
Priestley said. “This lights a fire
under our belly. It could be a great
turning point for us because we
have some real ‘competitive SOBs~
on this team.” '
