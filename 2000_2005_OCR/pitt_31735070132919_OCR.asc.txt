Server blamed for ticket problem

WILL SCHEFF
Staff Writer

Like a horror movie that
spawns a sequel, “Son of the Pitt
Basketball Ticket Debacle” debuted
at Pitt last week ‘

But instead of a convoluted lot-
tery system, this time the “monster”
was a temperamental Web site that
made online purchases of Pitt men’s

basketball season tickets almost.

impossible.

Most of the students who tried
to buy tickets online ended up aban-
doning the site and going to the
Petersen Events Center in person,
calling the ticket office from cell
phones while they stood in line.

“I waited in line for "three
hours,” Junior Lindy Grone said
“Hopefully, the new athletics direc-
tor can resolve this situation._”

And that’s just what Pitt
Athletics Director Jelf I_.ong says he
hopes to do. .

‘Tm really disappointed by

what happen ” Long said in an
interview Monday. “I do believe that
it’s important to make things [the
best possible] for our students,
which is why I felt so good about the
plan I put together in Oklahoma”
Long brought the new system
from the University of Oklahoma
when he came to Pitt this year. Jelf
Johncox, sports editor of The

Oklahoma Daily, Oklahoma’s stu-

dent newspaper, said the online sys-
tem has worked ﬁne there for the
past two years.

. “Everyone who wanted tickets
has gotten them,” Johncox said.
"Ihe online system was pretty effec-
tive at ﬁrst, and now they sell all of
the sports tickets online. I’ve never
heard about any problems with [the
server].”

A writer for The Daily mistak-
enly reported that Oklahoma experi-
enced similar problerns with its serv-
er for football ticket sales, but it
turned out that the problems were
only with some people’s home com-

puters, Johncox said. . -

Long mentioned A that
Oklahoma has newer software than
Pitt for the online ticket sales. But he
said that Pitt’s online ticket sales
provider, the Paciolan company,

who provides “tailored ticket infra-_

structures” according to their Web
site, assured Pitt’s athletic depart-
ment that their older software would
work “That’s why I’m even more
upset,” Long said

Paciolan representatives didn’t
returncallsrnadetothemlateinthe
business day on Monday.

Some students were unable to

get season tickets because of the

online problems. But Jason
Heggerneyer, director of sales. and
ticketing, wants them to lmow that
they still have a chance to come to
games.
“We will have tickets on an
individual—game basis,”
Heggerneyer said “We encourage

Football fans in aisles

Marc Gutowski had been
waiting to see the big Pitt—Notre
Dame football game.

The season-ticket holder
even got to Heinz Field an hour
and a half before kickolf to
claim his seat

Despite that, he didn’t get to

» see much of the game.

Gutowski had picked up
standing-room tickets for a few
of his friends, so a few minutes
before kickoff, he left his girl-
friend, Melanie Linn, to save his
seat and went down to the gates
to give them their tickets.

“It was one of the games I
really wanted_to go see,” he said.

He thought it was going to
take about ﬁve minutes to bring
the tickets to his friends and
return to his seat, but when he
tried to return to his seat, the
guards told him that he couldn’t.

“As soonas we lefttogo to
the bathroom or concessions,
you gave up your seat,”
Gutowski said the guards told
him _

 was not a new prob-
lem,‘ according to Carol
Sprague, Pitt’s senior associate
athletics director. a

At Heinz Field there are
three student—seating levels on
the 100, 200 and 500 levels. And
most students want to sit as close
as they can so more students
than there are seats for go down
to the lower seating areas, she
said A

“It was not a surprise,” she"

said

‘When Pitt played in Three A

Rivers Stadium, they had similar
problems, she said

“What happened at the
game was not unlike what hap-
pened at Three Rivers Stadium

games when it was sold out,”
she said. “It just took longer [to
deal with it] because of the mag-
nitude of it.” .

Pitt Police Chief Tim

‘Delaney added that this type of

problem also occurred when Pitt
played in Panther Stadium years
ago.
Because of the lack of seat-
ing in the lower areas on
Sunday, students began to stand
in the aisles. The ﬁre marshal
then asked for the aisles to be
cleared because they were vio-
lating ﬁre-safety regulations.
Around kickoff time, a
Heinz Field ofﬁcial called
Delaney to report the problem,
this was the ﬁrst complaint

Delaney has gotten fromstadi—,

um officials in the three years
Pitt has played there.

When he arrived, he looked
at the lower seating, levels,
which were ,cornpletely ﬁlled.
He added that the seating sec-
tions were so packed that they
appeared to be one large section.

According to Delaney,
Pitt’s team was driving the ball
toward the students’ end of the
ﬁeld. Since the students were
very excited, he did not want to
send his oﬂicers down into the
large crowd Aﬁer the play, the
officers went down and told stu-
dents to get out of the aisles.

They did not care if more
than one student was standing in
front of each seat, so long as no
one was in the aisles, Delaney
added ‘

S “We weren’t doing a head— ‘

count,” he said. ,
While they cleared the
aisles, guards did not let any stu-
dents in, Sprague said
According to Gutowski, a
guard told him Pitt had oversold

He added that tickets for certain games
that aren’t picked up by season-ticket hold-
ers will be made available to students.While
many students expressed their displeasure
over the online problems, Long wants to
make it clear that everything will be doneto
rectify the situation for next year.

“I assure our students that we’ll do
everything we can,” Long said. “Before we
use the ‘online ticketing process next year,
we will have done everything possible to
upgrade and test the system” He said that
this process would include upgrading the
software, perhaps using additional hardware
and maybe looking for a different Intemet
ticket-sales provider.

Long alsosaidthathewantstoincrease
the number of students who come to the bas-
ketball games, since last year’s average stu-

‘ dent attendance was fewer than 800.

“I think the beauty of [the Pete] is that
three-quarters of our arena is surrounded by
students,” Long said. ‘They can be right

help Pitt’s undefeated home record last

Even though Gutowski already had a
seat, and Linn had saved it for him, he could-
n’t go back in. '

“It basically mined the whole game,”
Linn said. “It was just a bad situation all
aroun ”

Though he said he didn’t blame the
event staﬂ°, he said Pitt should have done a
better job managing the ticket sales.

“We took the bruntof it,” he said. “I
paid money for the tickets, I expected to see
the game.”

By halftime, the guards let him and oth-

he said. “The only two scores, I missed.”

“'Ihey’d never do this to a section where
they paid real money,” he addecLi“It shows
how much the University really cares for
us.” .

When people left their seats during half-
time, they got their hands stamped so they
could retmn to their seats without any trou-
ble. According to Delaney, there were no
major problems after they began stamping

According to Sprague, after the game, a
group looks into all of the complaints they
receive. There was not more than a normal
amount of complaints ﬁled from people sit-
ting in the non-student sections.

The committee is, however, going to
look into possible solutions for this problem
so that it does not occur during the next
home game, which is in about two weeks.

Delaney suggested a few solutions:
‘stamping students’ hands in the beginning of
the game, giving students bracelets or
assigning seats, so that students coming late
in the game would not take the seats of stu-
dents who came early.

Authorless letter from Iraq an outrage

According to a letter to the editor
published in 11 different United
States newspapers, things in Iraq are
just dandy.

Part of the letter reads, “The
quality of life and security for citi-
zens has been largely restored, and
we are a large part of why that hap-
pened.” Sounds fabulous. There’s
only one problem.

No one knows who actually
wrote the letter. Not one of seven
soldiers contacted by USA Today, all
of whom are in the regiment the let-
ter purports to have come from, has
any idea who wrote it. ‘

One soldier only learned of the
existence of the letter after his father
congratulated him on writing —— and
having published — such a fine letter
in their town’s newspaper. That par-
ticular instance highlights the despi-
cable machinations behind this bla-
tant piece of propaganda being foist-
ed by who—knows-whom on newspa-
per readers.

This fabricated letter is clearly a
piece of public relations puffery. It’s
not surprising to see such a patent
manipulation of public opinion in the
face of sagging public support for
the continued American occupation
in Iraq. The Bush administration, in
fact, is undertaking an image cam-
paign to bolster support. While
Pentagon spokesman Bryan

Whitman denies any knowledge of a
coordinated campaign, someone has
to be behind this calculated maneu-
ver.

“Hometown” newspapers have a
particular interest in “their boys” on
the front. Hearing from them makes
for a good story and tugs the heart-
strings, and showing support for
them is patriotism on the small scale.
Targeting such papers with this kind
of orchestrated falsity is appalling.‘

However, the papers themselves
cannot be absolved. No paper should
run a letter without verifying the
identity of the purported writer. Here
at The Pitt News, we have a policy
of, at barest minimum, voice contact
with letter-writers before a letter gets
published. Granted, soldiers in Iraq
aren’t exactly a phone call away, but
the letters had to be sent from some-
where. Most soldiers have at least
limited access to e-mail, and can
always get snail-mail. All the news-
papers should have made some effort
to contact the writers and verify their
identity and if they had, in fact, writ-
ten the letter.

Instead, 11 newspapers ran let-
ters bearing false signatures, misrep-
resenting soldiers and playing into
the hands of a campaign carefully
orchestrated by some unknown enti-
ty.

What a disgrace.

O,T’arking God, who artin heaven

0, God of parking, hear my prayer.
Smite all drivers before me, that I may con-
veniently station my vehicle within two
blocks of my apartment.

Please accept my love and adoration,
O vehicular deity. I shall present Thee with
offerings of pilfered hubcaps on the days of
street cleaning, to be consumed by the

brushes of the holiest of street cleaners, and .

thence transported to your holy realm. O,
that my endeavors may lead me someday
to parking heaven, where space is plentiful,

with many a tree under which to place my ‘

chariot.

I have begun, O benevo-
lent God of stationary vehi-
cles, to lead a group of the
most faithful of your worship-
pers in communal prayer and
adoration in the most sacred
of parking garages available.

This blessed structure,
with countless parking spaces
of immeasurable size and
comfort, defends‘ our inner-
most sanctum. Vlfith its
ﬁendishly confusing number-
ing system and cunningly
crafted narrow ramps to con-
found. the heathens, only a true believer can
overcome these obstacles.

It is on Tuesday, the holiest of days,

that we gather to celebrate your leadership,
for ‘tis the day on which You, in Your ir1ﬁ-
nite wisdom, created that shining beacon of
our faith, the parking meter. Those faithless
curs who shun these holy relics, and
neglect to offer up the requisite fee, are
deserved of nothing but your wrath. Most
fervently do I detest such ﬂaunters, who
rightly deserve your punitive miriistrations.

May their windshields be covered with‘

holy mandates for modest tithes.

May the wheels of hardened unbeliev-
ers be immobilized by your righteous
metal boots. These lost souls undoubtedly
do not deserve to reside in your sparkling
demesne. I only hope they see the light

before they are relegated to the infernal
impound lot of eternity, where even the
doughtiest of men tremble before the fell
beast Diemveelsebub.

I have heard, Lord, of peoples blinded
by a diﬁerent order, who believe in a vast
transportation pantheon: such gods as
Minivan, squelcher of egos, and Esyoovy,
scourge of self-respect. They abase them-
selves before the idols of these and count-
less other deities, in pure ignorance of the
truth. Theirs is a misinformed path.

These sufferers of untruth need stum-

Neo-soul queen is back

Worldwide Underground
Erykah Badu

Motown Records
ﬁikﬁﬁ’

The queen of neo-soul is back and she’s taking
no prisoners with the release of Worldwide
Underground, a 10-track EP that leaves all of her
hip-hop contemporaries racing to ‘catch up.
Worldwide Underground transcends the gap
between Herbie Hancock-style funk and modern
hip-hop sounds with unprecedented singing.

The latest release from Badu was inspired dur-
ing one of the best underground concert toms of all
time, which you may have caught when it rolled
through Pittsburgh last winter as the “Frustrated
Artist Tour.” Not many artists can leave the crowd
waiting for almost three hours in a club packed to
capacity and not have one person leave or try to start
a riot out of frustration. And not many artists can
make you forget you just waited tlnee hours to see a
show by hitting you over the head with a perfor-
mance that is so memorable, you would have wait-
ed three years to see it.

For those of you who missed the tour: Bad11, her
back—up singers, drummer, upright bassist, key-
boardist and sound crew collectively took an anx-
ious, sold-out crowd at Club Laga, blew them away,
and repeatedly reinvented themselves with a perfor-
mance lasting well over two hours. With each new
song, Badu and her band ushered in different moods
and visuals that included shedding attire and eventu-
ally even showing her huge afro hairdo. She ﬁnished
the night by stage diving in her blue jeans, sleeveless
T-shirt and bare feet.

The crowd also managed to shed gallons of
sweat, rocking away to new jams featured on
Worldwide Underground and a slew of classic cuts
ﬁorn her ﬁrst two albums that kept an energy and

pace to the performance that amrihilates most rock
concerts.

Worldwide Underground takes the energy of
Badu’s live show and magically packs it into one
unforgettable, 10-track journey. Vlfrth some songs
lasting more than 10 minutes, you can forget every-
thing you thouglrt you knew about conventional hip-
hop. Worldwide Underground shatters the verse-
chorus-verse-chorus structure and implements a
more progressive stance -— if it sounds good, use it.

- Songs like “Bump it” and “Back in the Day”
make your eyes water from the amount of ear candy
they possess. Each track is just the right mixture of
solid live instrumentation, seamlessly blended with
traditional hip-hop samples that capture the ﬂavor of
the ‘60s funk and jazzpmovements and bring them
up to 2003. Badu’s own production team,
Freaquency, quickly makes a name for themselves
as the best production team in the hip-hop world.

Erninem and Dr. Dre have absolutely nothing
on Freaquency’s beats, and the alburn’s production
makes 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” sound like a live

recording of a country jarnboree. Bad11’s ﬁrst single, ‘

“Danger,” is a riveting tale of a woman who is mar-
ried into street-hustling, which is also a continuation
of themes developed in her last album, Mama ’s Gun,
and her debut record, Baduism.

Expect to hear Hendrix-style guitars and
Aﬁican tribal melodies that will stay with you well
into the next track, and smooth rhymes and har-
monies from this pioneer. Her melodies are,power-
ful but not overbearing. The music in Worldwide
Underground seems to play on Badu’s words as she
progresses from one catch melody to the next. The
catchy, innovative, but not in-your-face sampling
deserves a Nobel Prize for music. Everything in this
EP is simply perfect. It’s almost scary how perfect it
is.

Badu’s vocals are powerful, sensual, unique
and, most of all, uncompromising, as she once again
reminds the hip-hop World

Upon walking into the bar, a
guy walked up to me, stuck his ﬁn-

My response was, “Oh, that’s
so embarrassing for you.”

like that?

And then there was, “Excuse
me, but you seem to have
dropped...” I began looking down
at the ﬂoor for whatever must have

_ fallen out of my purse. A few sec-

onds later, he ﬁnished his sentence
by saying, “your smile.” Let me tell

you, I certainly didn’t pick it up for _

Luckily, those guys quit while

The other persistent chaps_

don’t seem to understand what

means you don’t have a chance.
Because if the boyfriend actually
does exist, then she isn’t on the mar-

Cobain, Rotten characters in new rock book

Never Mind the Pollacks

Neal Pollack’
Harper Collins
2003

If there’s ever been a way to deﬁne
the term “megalomania,” it’s in this book.

The humorously pompous Neal
Pollack, whose writing constantly blurs
the linebetween joking and lying, has
come out with his ﬁrst novel, and it’s a
doozy. “Never Mind the Pollacks” is the
story of the self-proclairried “rock critic”
Neal Pollack —— not to be confused with
the Neal Pollack who wrote this book —
as mostly told by fellow rock critic and
alter—ego Paul’ St. Pierre. For the most
part, Pollack’s life is seriously exaggerat-
ed, but for comical reasons. The story
even starts out with an amusing ampliﬁ-
cation of real life (or a conceived situation
that never happened) when Neal’s neigh-
bor, Elvis Presley, runs over Neal’s
oppressive, patriarchal, racist father.

Pollack’s madcap rock ‘I1’ roll fable
continues with other such odd, larger-

than-life myths as he wanders through

cities like Detroit, where he “discovers” a
young James Osterberg and turns him
into Iggy Pop; Los Angeles, where he
tells Dee Dee Rarnone that music should
return to its working—class roots; and
Seattle, where he fmds a young Kurt
Cobain to mentor and sculpt in "his own
image. . ,

What’s funny about the story is how,
each time Pollack meets new musicians,
he turns them into the personas and

images that music lovers would later

know them for. For example, there’s one
scene where Pollack teaches a group of
Londoners that the world is corrupt and
self—destructive, but the solution to_ these
problems is rock ‘n’ roll. Among these
Londoners is a young and impressionable
John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten of the Sex
Pistols. Another example ‘is when he’s
mentoring Kurt Cobain; he explains to
Kurt that nothing is moreimportant than
being popular. Each character is aﬁected
by Pollack, whether it’s a mere nudge in
another direction or a complete tum-
around.

Even without the rock ‘n’ roll part of

. the novel, this story is well told. Pollack

makes the grandiose narrative subtle and
entertaining, especially when it comes to
his self—descriptions. Pollack’s character,
though obnoxious, is portrayed in differ-
ent lights: sometimes he’s a sympathetic
character, other times he’s an alienating
asshole, which takes quite a bit of talent.
Moreover, the transition he makes from
sympathetic to alienating happens so ﬂu-
idly that it’s like turning a light on and off.
Neal Pollack’s writing has the soft touch
that makes a story good.

But since it is a rock ‘n’ roll novel, a
soundtrack sounds like the metaphorical
trident needed to make a Satan costume

complete. That’s why Pollack’s own
band, The Neal Pollack Invasion, has
come out with an album to be released
simultaneously with the book. The album,
also titled “Never Mind the Pollacks,” is
expected to rock very hard and expand the
aesthetics of anyone who listens to it.

Pollack content, check out Pollack’s
online journal, at www.nealpo11ack.com.

The Neal Pollack Invasion, Goldblade
and The Dirty Faces will play the Rex
Theatre in the South Side tonight at 9 p.m.

Not Metropol,

not Mars, the

show is going on at Laga

At the Drive-In has been on hiatus
for a few years now, and the five-piece
band decided to go in two separate
directions: Sparta, with its straightfor-
ward rock style, and The Mars Volta,
with enough experimentation to fill a
lab with projects for years to come.
The latter group has toured the country
many times, but Club Laga will get its
first attempt to host these amazing fel-
lows, along with spoken—word sensa-
tion Saul Williams, for one night.

The Mars Volta transcends many
genres, touching on hardcore, rock ‘n’
roll, jazz and even Latin—based fusion
in their sound. The band never has
been one to allow itself _to be limited
by anything, including marketability.

The Mars Volta consists of two of
the five members of the former ATDI
lineup, vocalist Cedric Zavala and gui-
tarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. They
also had Jeremy Ward around for live
knob tweaking, but he passed away
two months ago from drug overdose.

De—l0used in the Comatorium was
originally written from the inspiration
of Julio Venegas, a close friend of the
band members, who committed sui-
cide.

On their debut full-length album,

De—l0used in the Comatorium,
Rodriguez—Lopez, Zavala and Ward
enlisted Flea from the Red Hot Chili
Peppers to play bass on the record, and
RHCP guitarist John Frusciante to
guest on a track(— “Cicatriz ESP” The
album was anything but mainstream,
with only one song clocking in at less
than five minutes, and received many
rave reviews around the nation.

Performing with The Mars Volta
will be the slam poet Saul Williams.
Williams, who has spent some of the
late summer and early fall touring with
The Mars Volta, won the 1996 Grand
Slam Championship for his unmatched
improvised slam poetry. It’s like a rap
battle, but with more poetry and less
insults. Thestranger.com describes
Williams as a “hip-hop poet-preacher-
actor—rapper-singer-musician” and
says his poetry is “full of love lan-
guage.” Williams will be performing a
spoken—word reading of some of his
work from his latest book, “Said the
Shotgun to the Head,” which is cur-
rently available from
MTV/Pocketbooks.

The Mars Volta spent a good part
of the year touring with Queens of the
Stone Age and the Red Hot Chili

Miller leads ‘Pitt  
toweekend sweep 

1 RAYMOND NEWBY
Staff Writer

Middle hitter Megan Miller’s perfor-
mance’ aided the Pitt volleyball team in
extending its winning streak to nine games
with two victories over Big East opponents
Connecticut and St. John’s this weekend.

The team started the weekend by beat-

ing Connecticut Huskies on Friday evening‘

in front of a wild home crowd, then swept St
John’s Red Storm on Sunday afternoon for
their 13th victory in 14 matches.
Pitt 3 UConn 1

T Pitt (153, so Big East) opened their
match against UConn with a decisive garne-

one victory, 30-19. The lively crowd made
up mostly of student organizations seemed

“ to energize the Panthers at the start" of the

match. - .

“When you get 500 people in the Field
House, in the blue—backs,. it reallymakes a
big difference. - The I enthusiasm really
brought out the best in us. It would be nice to

have that all the time,” coach Chris Beerrnan

said.

The Huskies pulled out game two as
they salvaged a 30-28 come-from-behin
victory. , *

“We kinda put it in cruise control, an

unfortunately, UConn is too good of
a team to do that against, and they
came back and got us in that game,”
Beerrnan said.

Pitt trailed UConn by two
points midway through the third
match when Beerman called a time-
out.

“I got a little intense with them
and challenged them. They just
responded the way they have all '
year —— they just got really ﬁred up
and they took control of the match,”
he said . 1

His challenge apparently
worked, as the Panthers rattled oil“
13 of the next 15 points to win 30-
21. They ﬁnished off the Huskies
with a 30-24 victory in game four to
take the match 3-1. ' -

Miller led the attack for the
Panthers with game highs of 27 kills
and a .500 hitting percentage.

Two Panthers recorded double— '
doubles, with outside hitter Wendy Haﬂestad
registering 17  and a game-high 21 digs,
and setter Lindsey Macke posting 12 digs
and a game-high 52 

p Also contributing forthe Panthers were
outside hitter Sarah Rollrnan with  kills
and nine digs, and libero’ Megan McGrane
with 18 digs.

The Huskies (ll-9, 1-3), who suffered a
loss when assist-leader Julie Erbez went
down with an injury minutes into game one,
were lead by Jamie Hadenfeldt with 16 kills
and 11 digs. _ 1

Boston College will leave Big East for “ACC

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

Boston College armounced that its athletics program,

will be departing from the Big East Conference and joining

Athletics Director Jeif Long addressed the media on
Monday and took questions regarding the situation the Big
East Conference is now faced with.

Long said that the Big East will continue on its path
toward adding additional schools to the conference. '

‘There are a number of schools that have expressed
interest in joining the Big East Conference,” Long said “It
would be premature to name those schools, but I will tell you
that I feel like the pace of our expansion has accelerated
based upon [Boston College’s] decision, and I think you’ll be
hearing things in a very short period of time.” -

As of right’ now, the Big East will most likely follo
through on its original plan of having eight football-playing
schools and eight non—football-playing schools. ‘

“At this point, I’m very comfortable saying that we will
be a conference of eight footba1l—playing institutions, as well
as playing all the other sports, and eight schools that do not

A play football but do‘ play basketball and all of the other
. I sports,” Longsaid

the Atlantic Coast Conference after the 2003-04 season on _»

Many people have wondered about the guaranteed bid

that the Big East currently has in'the Bowl Championship

Series and whether or not that guaranteed bid will still be
offered Jeff Long is not one of ‘ those people. _

“We are certain that our BCS membership is intact and
our place at the table is intact through this current contract,”
Long said “Beyond that, it is yet to be seen what the BCS

will look like at all, but I remain very, very conﬁdent that the A

new Big East will have a place at the BCS table, and we will
be a member of the BCS going forward” ‘ '

While the possibility of a Boston College jump to the \

ACC was ‘rumored to be in the works for quite some time, it
still came as a shock to the remaining members of the Big
East. . »
According to Long, Boston College’s chancellor, as

well as‘ its athletics director, sat  face to face with the

other Big East members and committed to stay.

“When you sit in a room and look at people eye-to-eye,
face—to-face, and they make the commitment to stay, you
have a tendency to believe those people,” Long said.

One of the main concerns surrounding the loss of
Boston College is the loss of its strong television market.
Long believes that with the addition of new schools, the
strength of Big East basketball could actually be a strength
for the football schools. ’

“We believe that, with the addition of four schools to the
conference, we will have a very strong basketball conference
and certainly the strength of that basketball conference will
cany over into those television markets and help us with our
football television package as well.”

In light of the decision made by Boston College, head
coach Walt Harris expressed disappointment in the school’s

leadership.

“The most disappointing part of Boston College is that
they were part of this Big East team,” Harris said “We all
agreed to stay in it, and Ijust don’tthink that thatpart speaks
very well about who they are.”

Pitt’s loss not due to lack of leadership

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

Head coach Walt Hanis entered his
weekly press conference at the team’s prac-
tice facility on Monday visibly discouraged
over Pitt’s 20-14 loss to the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish over the weekend, but he
insisted that the team was only a few plays
away from winning the game.

Harris said that, while the team was not
confused, hesitation led to the offensive and
defensive lines being physically outplayed.

“I just think that we got a little hesi-
tant,” Harris said. “We weren’t as physical
as we needed to be, especially on offense.”

Throughout the game, Notre Dame ran
various stunts with its defensive line, and
Harris said that Pitt’s offensive front ran
into some trouble recognizing blocking
assignments. The offensive line has had to
deal with a number of injuries, and Harris
said that they will continue to try to
improve their assignment recognition.

At the start of the season, Hanis said
that senior leadership would be instrumen-
tal in the success of the team. When asked
about how he would evaluate the team’s
leadership thus far, Harris said that the best

way for leadership to improve is to lead by’

example on the ﬁeld.
“When you’re 3-2 you probably would

ﬁt

generalize and say that you’re not pleased
with your leadership,” Hanis said. “I know
our guys care. I know our seniors care.
They’ve just got to lead by playing better. I
think that’s the best way to lead.”_

It appeared that the Notre Dame

offense ran the same few plays right at Pitt’s
defense for most of the ga‘rne.i'Hanis com-
pared the physical nature of the game to a
war. ~ 

The Panthers were  with long
downs and distances throughout the game,
due in part to the lack of production in the
running game, but also due to the physical

Pitt drops
two games
over weekend

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Offense continued to be a problem for
the Pitt women’s soccerteam in its two Big
East Conference games against Seton Hall
and Rutgers over the weekend. _

The Panthers have managed only six
goals in their last eight games leading up to
the weekend. After 180 minutes of regula-
tion play and two extra periods, Pitt had only
seven goals. I ‘

Seton Hall 2, Pitt 1

The Panthers (4-7-2 Overall, 1-1-1 Big
East) let a ﬁrst-half, 1-0 lead slip away, as
two late scores by Seton Hall ﬁnished the
Panthers (4-7-1, 1-2-0) on Friday night

Seton Hall forward Rita Massot awoke
the Pirates’ offense from ﬂieir near-80-
minute slumber when she assisted on the
game-tying goal and tallied the garne-win-
ning goal. .

VV1th a little over ten minutes left in the
game, Pirates’ midﬁelder Aubrey Ellezy
took a pass from Massot and tied the game
on a shot ﬁom ﬁve yards out The goal came
at 79:20. '

VV1th 2:58 left to play in the game,
Massot scored an unassisted goal on an open
net to put the Pirates up 2-1.

Seton Hall goalkeeper Buffy
Wojiciehowski recorded one save on the
day. Her supporting cast helped her shut
down the Panthers’ offense by stopping 13
of Pitt’s 14 shots.

The Panthers’ only goal came at 36:08,
when Erin Hills scored her third goal on the
season. The goal came on a direct kick that
ﬂew past Wojiciehowski.

“We thought we had the game in con-
trol,” Sue-Moy Chin said. “[We] got caught
applying too much pressure in Seton Hall’s
zone, and that was why two goals were
scored in the ﬁnal ten minutes.”

Rutgers 0, Pitt 0

Neither Pitt, nor No. 6 Rutgers, scored
a goal through 90 minutes of regulation and
two overtimes on Sunday afternoon.

Panthers’ goalkeeper Jamie Pelusi pro-
vided enough entertainment to make up for
the zeros on the scoreboard. She recorded a
season high 14 saves to keep the Scarlet
Knights (744, 1-1-1) off ﬂie scoreboard.

Pelusi came within one save of her
career-best 15 saves, which she recorded
against Providence back on Oct 11, 2002.

“[Pelusi] was very solid for  Chin

said. “She made excellent saves.”
Pelusi was not the only Panther busy

Turnovers a factor in Pitt’s loss

Harris, page 10

mismatch up front. Harris said he thought
that it was not one single aspect of the game
that was the problem, but rather a combina-
tion of things that led to the Panthers’
demise.

‘We just couldn’t keep our defense off
the ﬁeld, especially in the second half,”
Harris said. “So it’s a combination of
things, not just that we couldn’t stop their
running game. We just didn’t get it done.
We need to be more ready to play.”

Ham's also thought that Notre Dame
knew the Panthers’ weaknesses even better
than they themselves did. After facing two
spread offenses in Toledo and Texas A&M,

Harris felt that the pass defense was the
biggest area of concern. ~

“We thought that [run defense] would-
n’t be a problem,” Harris said. “We knew
they were good, though, and I tried to alert

V our players.”

Harris said the game was ultimately
decided by turnovers. The Panthers needed
to play mistake-free football in order to be
successful, and that will be Harris’ focus
this week, when the team prepares to begin
Big East Conference play at Rutgers on
Oct. 18.

‘The bottom line is that when we win,
we don’t turn the ball Over,” Harris said.
“That’s why we coach and that’s why we
practice. We practice to get better at it.”

Miller named the Big East Conference

out to an early, 14-6 advantage and went on
to win 30-15.

Game two proved to be more diﬁicult,
with the two teams ﬁghting back and forth,
matching each other point for point for much
of the game, but Pitt pulled out the 32-30
victory. ._

Game three was tight for most of the
way until the Panthers pulled out four
straight points and the 30-25 victory.

Miller had 15 kills, a game-high .444
hitting percentage and 7 blocks for the
Panthers, which, combined with her totals

In ﬁve Big East matches this year, she
has totaled 87 kills while hitting .429. ,

“She just took over. She’s really consis-

Rollman posted a double-double with
10 digs and a game-high 16 kills, and
Hatlestad added nine kills and nine digs.

Also contributing were outside hitter

high 11 digs and McGrane with 10 digs.

led by Jackie Ahlers with 13 kills and seven

stopping shots. Rutgers ﬁred a total of 25

shots. Midﬁelder Aimee Romasco and ,

defenders Jackie Reuter and Carli Brill were
were pivotal in keeping the ball from going
in the net They blocked several Scarlet
Knight shots to sustain what would be
Pelusi’s fourth career shutout. ‘

Although the Panthers did not defeat
the Scarlet Knights, the tie will give them a
point in the Big East playoff race.

“Getling a point in the Big East is
good,” Chin said A ‘

Chin was satisﬁed with the way her ‘

team rebounded after Friday’s late game let-
down to play solid defense against a very
good Rutgers team ‘
