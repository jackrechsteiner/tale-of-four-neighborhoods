Budget cuts library hours

MARIAH MOORE
Staff Writer

If you want to borrow a library book on
Sunday, you’re out of luck

Last Tuesday, the Camegie Library sys-
tem cut hours by an average of 21 percent and
suspended all outreach programs not funded
by grants. Unless state leaders amend the bud-

- get‘ for next year, the changes in the Camegie

system will last until the libraries receive more
ﬁnancial support

Governor Ed Rendell’s proposed budget

for next year reduces library ftmding ﬁom
$75.6 million to $37.6‘ million, including a

‘$2.4 million loss in funds for the Carnegie
' Library system. Although the budget has not

been approved, officials at Carnegie made
organizational changes as if it had.

A Before the budget cut, Carnegie reading
programs reached 60,000 school-age children,
in addition to the 50,000 children under the
age of 5 who participated in more than 3400
programs, according to Herbert Elish, director
of Camegie Library. Half of the 2.2 million
patrons of the Carnegie Library system are
children and parents. John‘ Cihon, who spends
as many as eight hours each weekend in the

library with his ﬁve—year—old son, said their
time at Carnegie has helped his son’s intellec-
tual development. »
‘The Carnegie provides services that oth-
erwise I could not afford,” Cihon said.
Resources for adults are also at risk Maria
Bethel, a Pitt student studying public adminis-
tration and a mother of three, - relies on
Carnegie Library’s Internet access to do school
work. A cut in library hours _worries[ Bethel,
who carmot afford a home computer. i
While Bethel uses the Camegie comput-
ers, her children take advantage of services
like story time and Intemet games. ”
“My four year old became computer liter-
ate since coming here, and I.use the Internet
for everything” Bethel said.
' If the budget cut goes through,‘ 100 com--

. puters will be removed from the library system

when their leases expire, according to Elish.

The cut jeopardizes plans at the Camegie,“
which had generated $15 million from a bond,
and plarmed to renovate ﬁve branches in the
next year. . '
V Those protesting the proposed cuts urged
patrons -to write their legislators. All the
changes made in response to the budget ‘cuts
can be found at www.camegielibrary.org.

Volume XVIII, Number 9
Service workers
sign a three—year

contract With Pitt

News Editor

-After several months of negotiations.

and protests over a proposed 75 percent.

health benefits cost increase, Pitt’s» ser-
vice workers agreed to a three—year con-

tract that provides higher salary rates to-

help employees cover the rising cost of
health care. - ~ F

The service workers, represented by
the Service Employees International
Union, ratified the new contract early
Thursday morning. For each of the next

three years, the employees will receive a

wage increase of 3 percent.

But although Pitt’s service employ-
ees were satisfied enough to sign the new
contract, SEIU spokesman Tom Hoffman
said the battle over rising health care
costs will continue. -

“The health care crisis goes on. The
raises will help protect the workers for a
year or so,” Hoffman said. “Who knows
what’s going to happen the next time
around?” ,

The contract is the best that service
workers at Pitt have received in the past
10 years, according to Gabe Morgan, the
building and service director for SEIU
Division .29.

In the past month, service workers
have joined supporters and union mem-

bers to stage several protests, including , .

one on May 17 that culminated in the
arrests of 17 people for blockingpearly
morning traffic Downtown. The protest-
ers had gathered outside the offices of
UBMC Health Plan, the provider of Pitt’s
health insurance. ' A

Other groups represented by SEIU,
including Pittsburgh’s Downtown jani-

‘tors, face the threat of unaffordable

health care in the coming months’ and
years.

“We will continue to fight for health
care,” Hoffman said, adding that the
Downtown janitors’ contract expires in
November.

Pitt Vice \Chancellor for Public
Affairs Robert Hill said that Pitt was
“pleased to have the agreement estab-
lished.”

_ He added that Pitt has always
enjoyed a good ‘working relationship
with employees who ‘are members of
SEIU and that the University .looks for-

ward to working with them in the future.

Port Authority budget waits
for state funding decision

I. ELIZABETH STROHM
* News Editor

Bus patrons aren’t the only ones wor-
ried about Port Authority’s proposed fare
hikes and schedule cuts.

Members of Port Authority’s board of
directors say they’re also concerned — con-
cerned enough to defer the adoption of their
2004 operating budget, which would have
gone into effect Tuesday, until state legisla-
tors determine the levels of state funding for
public transportation.

“It is vital for state elected oﬂicials to
fully understand and appreciate the grave
consequences [of the proposed cuts],” said
Estella Smith, the Port Authority board
administration and ﬁnancial chairperson, in
a press release. ’“Every Allegheny County
resident, whether they use public transporta-
tion or not would be affected, and for some
the consequences would be catastrophic.”

Facing a projected deﬁcit of $19 million
in the 2004 ﬁscal year, Port Authority exec-

utives have proposed a base fare increase of’

25 cents, to $2, and the elimination of

v Sunday service and nighttime weekday ser-

vice. ,
In addition to’ the public changes Port
Authority proposed to ease the budget crisis,
the company plans to save $5 million in

what it called administrative economies,

which includes the elimination of 21 ad1nin—

istrative and three non-operating positions.
These cuts, added to the 33 administrative
position cuts last year, create an 18 percent
cut to the total administrative work force.

To save money, Port Authority also
placed a freeze on hiring, wages and salaries;
reduced training, travel and marketing
expenditures; and laid off 88 employees.

Port Authority’s current budget woes
did not prevent it from wimring the
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award,
given by the Government Finance Officers
Association of the United States and
Canada, forgits ﬁscal year 2003 Operating
and Capital Budgets.

Port Authority stands among previous
recipients who “pioneered efforts to improve
the quality of budgeting. and provided an
excellent example for other governments
throughout North America,” according to a
press release from GFOA announcing the
award.

“It represents the commitment of [Port
Authority] and staif to meeting the highest
principles of governmental budgeting,” the
release stated.

Senate approves slot machines at race
tracks‘ '

Pemisylvanians are one step closer to
hearing the clink of slot machines in race-
tracks.

Senate, after debating until after midnight,
passed a bill with an amendment to allow
slot machines in racetracks. The bill passed
by a vote of 27-22

Pennsylvania tax- .
payers, according to the bill’s proponents.

The slot machine amendment, which
also passed by a vote of 27-22, is another
step toward Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell’s
plan to stimulate Pennsylvania’s struggling
racetrack industry while generating revenue,
which he said would be used to lower prop-
erty taxes. The plan to put slot machines in
racetracks, which was supported largely by
democrats, the minority party in the Senate,
spurred opposition from some religious and
anti—garnb1ing groups.

If the bill passes through the House
unaltered and is signed by the governor, each
racetrack in Pennsylvania could have as
many as 3,000 slot machines. The bill is
expected to generate up to $700 million each
year in tax revenue within three years,

 

They did, and Snider now
must remain in Seoul, the country’s capital,
until the appeal hearing in two to six months.

Prosecutors said that Snider, who was
held for six months in a Korean jail during
the trial proceedings, attacked Penich when
Penich made a sexual advance at her after a

night of dancing and drinking on St-

Patrick’s Day, 2001. Both Penich and
Snider, who was _a student at Marshall

University, were studying abroad in Korea.
Although Snider, in anAssociated Press
interview, expressed disappointment that she
would not be returning to the United States
as early as she hoped, she said she looks for-
ward to spending her time in Korea sight-
seeing with her mother, who has remained in
the country with Snider throughout the trial.

Kraft Foods, Inc. hides behind fat kids

It’s no secret that American kids,

a like adults, are getting dangerously

fatter and fatter. In fact, we’re the fat-
test nation on Earth. A combination of
sedentary entertainment options and
dino—sized portions of macro-cheese
and mega—pie are contributing to the
epidemic porking—up of the country,
and the health risks are indisputably
startling.

It would seem that any attempt by
a food manufacturer or marketer to
stop the insanity would be a step in
the right direction.

That’s not necessarily the case.

Kraft Foods, Inc., the nation’s
largest food manufacturer,
announced, this week, its plans to
combat childhood obesity by investi-
gating limits on portion sizes and
eliminating in—school marketing.

That means no more Oreo book
covers, no Nabisco posters, no Easy
Mac scoreboards and no product sam-
ples or contests in the classroom.

While Kraft will consider chang-
ing sizes of their snack-packs, the
treats will still be available in vending
machines in schools.

It may seem like a noble effort on
the face of this Phillip-Morris owned
behemoth, but in reality, Kraft is hid-
ing behind fat kids.

To say that sponsorship of a
scoreboard causes obesity is absurd.
Given the choice between an apple

and a cookie, just about any kid is
going to choose a cookie, regardless
of who paid for the scoreboard at
school. A recent study, done by
researches at the University of
Minnesota and published by the

. American Public Health Association,

shows that kids prefer cookies to
apples, no contest. . 

I Slimming down marketing efforts
is an easy way to pocket more cash.
It’s not, however, a benevolent out-
reach toward children’s health.

If Kraft were trulyjconcerned with
wellness, they could change. how they
spend their in-school marketing dol-
lars. Sink some cash into athletic
equipment. Publish food guide pyra-
mids. Heck, make some healthy food.

As ridiculous as they seem to us
now, corporate lawsuits are becoming
reality. What if, 10 years from now,
junk-food giants are on the receiving
end of tobacco—style liability judg-
ments, saying they knew all along
they were purveying a dangerous
product and marketing it directly to
kids, in schools, no less?

How convenient it would be for
Kraft to mention this anti-obesity ini-
tiative, this juggling of marketing
dollars —‘ because rest assured they
will still reach children through
advertising, in schools or not —— as
proof of their honorable, healthy
intentions.

Eugs, rocks dangers of helmet-less riding

CALEB WALLACE
For The Pitt News

I am writing in response to a [June 18]
editorial regarding the helmet law in
Pemrsylvania. I’ve ridden motorcycles for
almost as long as I’ve driven, and I can say
with total certainty that repealing the hel-
met law is not a great stride forward. In fact,
it’s anything but.

I can relate to the large population of
riders who feel it’s their God-given right to
ride without a helmet But the notion that
these people impose no greater burden on
the rest of us is simply wrong. Who pays
when a rider’s $10,000 medical insurance,
which might" pay for an ambulance ride and

half a day in the hospital, runs out? If you

want to ride without protecting
your dome, you should give up

window? I. can tell you from experience
that it stings and burns, even through a pair

of jeans, so what happens when it hits a

rider in the forehead?

You would be amazed at the things that
collide with your head when you’re driving
free of a steel cage and shatterproof glass.
I’ve got scuﬁs, chips and splatters all over
my helmet, and the bugs —— which many
shrug off as harmless — do not seem so
mild-mannered when a beetle hits you at 65
mph. _ .
I had cuts and bruises from the ﬂying
creatures before I bought the ballistic
armor, studded gloves and full-face helmet
that I wear every time I ride, 105 in the
shade or 55 and raining. ‘

Suggesting that helmets could be a

safety hazard is nothing short of
ridiculous. The trade-off for

the right to any additional aid. You would   vision is an inﬁnitely

ing for someone else’s reckless
disregard for safety.

What about the rider who takes an
errant rock to the face? Do you think he’s
going to maintain the same level of control

' over his bike as a helmeted rider? If you’re

driving a car and you hit me, I’m much
more likely to survive when I’m wearing
protective gear. What is ﬂre scene going to
be like when you tag someone without a
helmet, and he or she spills the contents of
his or her skull onto your windshield?
You’re not going to visit a dead guy in the
hospital, and most insurance companies
don’t appreciate vehicular manslaughter.
Even for people who don’t ride, I guar-
antee in the long run that they, too, will pay
for this law change. How about the high-
way driver who tosses a cigarette out his

» ent dangers that exist. The '

notion of “I might die” is entire-
ly too ambiguous to make an impact. Most
never take a safety course, and because it’s
so easy, some riders never even get their
license and opt instead to renew their per-
rnit each year.

i I understand that editorials are opinion-
based, but I hope you’ll at least reconsider
your stance on the matter. Riders with hel-
mets are much safer than those without,
both for themselves and the people around
them. Perhaps I’ll be proven wrong in the
long run. Right now, I’m gonna go order a
new helmet.

Where in the world did

It’s nearly 7 .’p.m. on _a
Wednesday night and the streets of
Bessemer Court at Station Square are
bustling with people attending the
Summer Concert Series. Digby from
105.9 The X is spinning X-music
near the small
stage. Several
teenagers sit at
tables close to
the stage, while
Marc Broussard
and his band
begin getting
ready to perform.

It’s a fairly
sparse crowd, but
that doesn’t
b o t h e r
the
21-year-old, up-
and-coming sen-
from
Louisiana who
plays a mix of
acoustic rock
blues spiced with
Cajun ﬂavor.

“lt , really
doesn’t make any
difference to me;
I’ve run into lots
of people who
have qualms
about who they
are playing with
or what time
slot,” Broussard
said. “Since I’ve
started touring,
we’ve pretty
much been the
first of three
bands. It doesn’t
make a differ-
ence to me, as long as I am playing.
I could play for 30 people or 1,000; it
doesn’t matter. It’s always a good
time.”

As he launches "into his set, the
teenagers sing every word along with
him. He croons the lyrics to his
album’s moniker song, “Momentary
Setback,” and rocks out to “The
Wanderer,” the album’s opening
track. The band members he is tour-
ing with, bassist Allan Maxwell and
drummer Stephen Chopek, only met
two weeks ago.

“At first, it was kind of scary.

Souhern

Before we played together we had a
rehearsal, and the rehearsal‘ room
that we were inwas really big, loud
and booming, and we couldn’t really
hear each other right. It was really
scary and it bummed me out a whole
lot. But the next day we had a show
and we rocked ass,” said Broussard.
Between unreleased songs and

event at Bessemer Court in Station Square last Wednesday, June 25.

tracks from his album, Broussard
said, “Since we’re near water, I’m
going to play a tribute to my ‘man,
Otis Redding.” He launches‘ into
Redding’s “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of
the Bay,” playing the tune with his
eyes shut most of the time, putting
everything he’s got into the song. .

The guys don’t launch into 15-
minute renditions of Broussard’s
songs, as time is a precious commod-
ity. H

“We like to play as many songs
as possible in the amount of time that
we have,” he said.

 

Broussard recorded his debut
album with the help of his father, Ted

.Broussard of Boogie Kings. The

recording process wasn’t easy.

“I think that he anticipated that
he was going to have a lot more input
than he did. “So it was a tough time
for both of us,” Broussard said‘. “It
was a time for him to say, ‘I guess
i - it’s time to step

back and let Marc
dohis own thing.’
At the same time,
for me, it was like,
I’m actually taking
away from 16 years
of tradition of me
and Pops playing

go through that to
get where we are
now. And where we
are now is probably
better than we’ve
been, ever.”

While his
father doesn’t regu-
larly tour with him,
he joined him to

play two shows
with Martin Sexton.
.“We had a

blast and the people
loved it,” Broussard
said. .
Ted will take
the stage with his
son for a L few
upcoming dates.
Looks like the tra-
dition ‘isn’t quite
broken.

Momentary Setback. It will hit stores
later this month. Broussard will go
back into the studio in December,
and that album will likely be released
next wi_nter. In the meantime,
Broussard will continue to tour
relentlessly to promote what he has
done thus far. ,

The Fourth of July is here, and a great
opportunity presents itself— a reason to set
ﬁre to  things. But while we are all out
igniting colorfullexplosives, canisters that
smoke and random pieces of lawn furniture,
let’s not forget that ﬁreworks can be dan-
gerous, and that some are illegal in
Pennsylvania

The types of ﬁreworks that most peo-
plewill light in their backyards are lmown
as consumer ﬁreworks. What most people
will see at professional shows are called dis-
play ﬁreworks. The laws that cover display
ﬁreworks are relatively clear — if you don’t
have a license to do so, lighting display ﬁre
works is illegal. » . ’ _

But the laws surrounding consumer
ﬁreworks are more involved. The U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission sets
a 50-milligram limit on explosive material
that can be contained  a con-
sumer device. Beyond that, the ‘
laws vary from state to state.
West Virginia and Marylan .
are two of the 37 states to
allow some or all consumer
ﬁreworks.
other end of the "\
spectrum are states , ‘
such as New York and New Jersey that do
not allow any consumer ﬁreworks, includ-
ing‘ those permitted by the CPSC.
Pennsylvania and Ohio, among other states,
fall into ‘a middle category that allows only

 
    
 
   

sparklers and other small novelties. A rule -

of thumb with this category is: if it’s sold at
the supermarket, it’s legal. '
._ Still, the fact that a ﬁrework is legal

According to the CPSC, a sparkler —— one
of the most commonly sold novelties —

can reach temperatures around 2,000»

degrees Fahrenheit", approximately the tem-
perature of lava as it erupts from a volcano,
and can easily cause third-degree burns. ‘

By following the laws and exercising
some common sense, such as keeping
water ‘nearby and not pointing ﬂaming
objects at fellow revelers, you can hopeful-
ly avoid injury and can have a fun, safe and
bum-free July 4. ‘ 1

It all

Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra

July 4, 8 p.m.

Point State Park, Free

The Fourth of July affords myri-
ad options to people who want to
take part__ in some activity. You can
watch fireworks, cook out, get
together with family or go to a park
with friends and play a pick-up game
of America’s Pastime.

But for those in Pittsburgh, the
Symphony provides one more
option. In what has become an annu-
al event, the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra puts on a free show at
Point State Park, per-
forming rousing
renditions of
music that
has come
to define
the nation,
as a prelude
to the always-
impressive fireworks .
display that caps off the holiday.

This year, the Orchestra, con-
ducted by Assistant Conductor
Daniel Meyer, will perform nine
pieces of music to warm up the
crowd for the crack, boom, bang_ of

   

that
Day. Among

help mark
the
pieces that will be performed are
“The Star—Spangled Banner,” selec-
tions from “The Sound of Music”

the fireworks
Independence

and “Raiders of the Lost Ark,”
“Yankee Doodle” and, concluding
the performance, Tchaikovsky’s

' “I812 Overture.”

If you can’t make this perfor-
mance but want to experience the
orchestra in a similar outdoor setting,
don’t fret. Their performance on
Friday is the first of three “Serenades
under the Stars.” The other two, on
July 5 in South Park and July 6 in
Hartwood, will be slightly different
programs but will still provide the

same excellent opportunity to
see’ the wonderful
orchestra outside
and for free.

T h e
P i t t s b u r g h
‘Symphony is one
of the best in the
world, and it’s_always a
treat to hear them perform.
It’s even better, though_, to hear them
play distinctly American music under
the stars as part of the celebration of

our nation’s independence.

Wilson named to Mackey Award Watch List

Miami to Big East:
ACC-ya guys later

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

After more than two months of
speculation, the Atlantic Coast
Conference’s plans to expand were
set in motion on Monday, when
Miami and Virginia Tech

announced that they had accepted -

invitations to switch leagues.
Their departure leaves the Big
East with six football.-playing
schools after the 2003 season and
puts the conference in a different
scenario than previously expected.
Originally, the ACC was inter-
ested in‘ adding Syracuse and
Boston College, along with Miami.
Instead, the league’s ‘members
opted to go with Virginia Tech,
extending formal invitations to the
Hokies and Hurricanes last week.
While Virginia Tech, a former
plaintiff in the lawsuit filed against
_the ACC, acceptedthe invitation
almost immediately, Miami waited
until the June 30 deadline to listen
to the Big East’s counterproposals

and goofy process,” Miami

President Donna Shalala said dur-

ing a press conference Monday.
“But it has allowed us the opportu-
nity to give ourselves some dis-
tance, so that we got a yiew of who
we are, where we are and where we
want to be.”

The Big East’s counterproposal
was supposedly financially greater
than the ACC’s, but it was appar-
ently not enough.

According to Big East
Commissioner Michael Tranghese,
the conference members have no
plan yet about what to do with what
is left of the Big East, and he said
that a plan should not be expected
soon.

“What we’ve talked about have
been concepts,” Tranghese said in a
teleconference on Monday. “We’re
not going to solve the problem by
the weekend. There are so many
details, we have to make certain we
make the right move.”

What Tranghese is sure of is
how the public View the leaders
and members of both conferences.

RYAN WALKER
For The Pitt News

Big East football suffered an enormous loss
when Miami and Virginia Tech opted to depart for
the Atlantic Coast Conference. The‘ question on
the minds of all Big East football fans is: What
will become of the conference? I

What this will mean for the Pitt football pro-
gram in the long run remains to be seen, but the
coaching staff and administration are confident
and optimistic. ’ _.

Recruiting coordinator Bryan Deal empha-
sized that last week and said that, while the situa-
tion has had “a little bit of an impact  it’s in
great hands with Chancellor‘ [Mark] Nordenberg.”

“We have full confidence in our administra-
tion, and {this is going to work out in the long
run,” Deal added. .

Chancellors and presidents of the other Big

S_ East football schools echoed Deal’s positive atti-
tude in a statement they made, vowing that the

Big East would become “even stronger.”

‘.‘The Big East remains _a strong, elite confer-
ence comprising some of the finest universities in
the-country,” the statement read. “[We] will con-

tinue to approach [competition] with .commit—

ment, creativity and a sense of urgency.”

Virginia‘Tech and Miami are two of the most
powerful footballprograms in the country. Miami
has the best record among all Division-I football
teams over the past three years. Together, the two
defecting schools account for nine of the 12 Big
East football championships.

With the departure of Virginia Tech and
Miami, the Big East football conference is in dan-
ger of losing all of its credibility. When the move
is made before the 2004 season, the only teams
remaining in the conference will, be Pitt, West
Virginia, Boston College, Syracuse and Rutgers,
while Connecticut is scheduled to join in 2005.
There has been some speculation that the replace-
ment teams might include Louisville and
Cincinnati.

The loss of Miami and Virginia Tech will
almost certainly have an effect on Pitt’s recruit-
ing, but Deal feels confident that this recruiting
class will remain strong.

“It’s amazing, kids are very resilient,” Deal
said. “They’ve been interested in it when they’re
here, they may ask a question or two, but they see
the sincerity in our eyes and in our voices that
we’re committed to playing football at the highest
level.” .

The resilience of the recruits will be tested,
and only time will tell what the future holds for
the Big East football conference. It will undoubt-
edly be a challenging time, with many questions
to be answered over the next few months, but the
leaders of the Big East and Pitt coaches alike have

"maintained their positive outlooks.

“We have a great university and a great foot-
ball program, and we’re going to continue to
build and just continue to rise the way we have
the last four or five years, and [the recruits] said
they wanted to be a part of that,” Deal said.-

T ranghese uncertain about what will happen to the BigEast

Big East, page 9

“I think the public is disgusted
with us all,” he said. “Institutions of
higher education are held to a higher
standard and I think people have
looked at us — and I don’t think in a
good way, me included.”

With the departure of the Big
East’s two most successful football
programs, the conference will have
six'members after this season, with
Connecticut scheduled to replace
Temple in football after the 2004
season.

Although it has not yet been dis-

cussed, Tranghese admitted that the
conference might consider moving
UConn’s admission to the league up
a year.

“We haven’t had discussions
about it,” Tranghese said. ‘‘It’s ‘a
subject we’re going to talk about and
it’s one of the things we’ll put” on the
table.”

Despite losing” Miami and
Virginia Tech, the Big East is safe as
far as keeping its automatic Bowl
Championship Series bid and its
television -contracts for both football
and basketball.

According to Tranghese, the Big

East is entering the first year of a
four-year basketball contract with
ABC/ESPN, along with a separate
agreement with CBS. The confer-
ence is also in the third year of a
football contract that runs until
2007.

Concerning the BCS, Tranghese
said he is not worried about the Big
East losing its automatic bid, reason-
ing that there is nothing in the legis-
lation that says the conference
should lose it. The current BCS con-
tract ends after the 2005 season.

“We’re in the BCS for the next
three years,” he said, I

One problem the Big East faces

is how it will remain a_major foot- _

ball conference. NCAA rules man-
date that, to be considered a part of

Division I—A football, the conference ,

must ‘have no less than eight mem-
bers by 2005. c

“We don’t have to do anything
right away,” Tranghese. said. “We
haven’t sat down and analyzed any
schools. There are schools that have
tried to approach us and they have
been shut down. We were not
involved in anything until we got a
final decision from Miami.” .

The one thing that Tranghese -

does not want to do is raid another
conference, the way he feels the
ACC did to the Big East.

“I talked to the commissioners
from two [leagues and I’ve given my
word that they won’t get blind-
sided,” he said. “I would let them
know who might -be involved. We
won’t do it the way the ACC did.”

While he would not comment on

‘ what teams the Big East might be ‘

interested in adding, Tranghese said
he has spoken withmthe commission-
ers from both the Atlantic—1O and
Conference USA. Louisville has
been rumored to be interested in
making the jump, but Tranghese
said, “the talk about Louisville has
come from that part.”

Tranghese considered" this year
the greatestin the history of the Big

East. After winning the 2001 foot-‘

ball national championship, Miami
lost last year’s title game to Ohio
State.

The Syracuse men’s basketball
team won anational championship

h and St. John’s defeated Georgetown

to win the National Invitational

Tournament. UConn’s women also '

won the basketball national champi-
onship, giving the Big East the
women’s champion for the fourth
year in a row.

“We went from total euphoria to

the deepest, darkest period in our _

league,” Tranghese said. “We coul
have stayed the way we were; no one
was threatening to get rid of us.”

Of all the options that the Big ‘

East will «now consider, the way to
stay successful, ‘according to
Tranghese, is as easy as winning
games. I ‘ '

“I guess it’s not any more com-
plicated than that,” he said. “We
don’t need to do anything other than
win games. We’ve got some good
programs and I don’t think there’s

any hidden magic ——. except win- ‘

ning.”
