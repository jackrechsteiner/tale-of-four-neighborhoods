UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

VOLUME 34 ' NUMBER 20 .

Due to state uncertainty, board  

postpones action on Pitt budget

ith Pennsylvania law-
makers potentially
still weeks away from

approving a state budget for the V

ﬁscal year that begins July 1, Pitt
trustees have postponed meeting

to approve the University’s own

budget.
The trustees’ budget com-

_ mittee had been scheduled to

meet today (June 13) to endorse
a ﬁscal ‘year 2003 Pitt budget
for consideration at next week’s
meeting of the full Board of

Trustees. 3
But because the Pitt budget
hinges largely on the University’s
state funding, trustees have
postponed their budget commit-
tee meeting until July 15.

onjuly 1 5, the trustees’ executive
committee (which is empowered
to approve University budgets)
would meet later that same day
to give ﬁnal approval, said board
Secretary Robert E. Dunkel-
man. ’

Meanwhile, full Board of
Trustees will meet as scheduled
onjune 20, but without consider-

said.

Pennsylvania’s revenue short-
fall for the current ﬁscal year
totaled $1.1 billion by the end of
May and is expected to reach $1.3
billion by theend of this month,
Chancellor Mark N ordenberg

noted at the June 10 Senate I

Council meeting.

“Despite the factfthat these
are big numbers, I’m not sure
that people within the University
appreciate just how serious the
situation is,” Nordenberg said.
“So, let me say: Those are really
big numbers, and this is a serious
situation for the commonwealth
and for the University.”

A cut in Pitt’s state appropria-
tion would hurt the University

“lon*ger-term’ implications 3 for
the structure of the institution,”
the chancellor warned.

“ He recalled a 1995 Pitt salary
freeze (necessitated, in part, by a
meager state appropriation) that
effectively reduced salary levels
here for years afterward, taking
into account inﬂation and the
fact that many peer universities
awarded raises that year.

Last summer, state lawmak-

ers approved a 0.6 percent
increase in Pitt’s appropriation
for the current ﬁscal year, bring-
ing it to $178.5 million. But,
facing a recession—related deﬁcit,
Gov. Mark Schweiker later
imposed 3 percent freezes on
funding to Pitt and other state-
supported universities.

For Pitt, the 3 percent freeze
amounted to $5.4 million. State

, ofﬁcials warned that they might

from Pitt’s ﬁnal monthly appro-
priation payment for FY 2002,
scheduled for late this month.
“We still have not gotten
deﬁnite word from the state that
it is withholding the f11ll $5.4
million from our June payment,
but all indications are that that

will be the case,” said Thurman ,

Wingrove, assistant vice chancel-
lor, Financial I-nformation, in an
interview yesterday.

To prepare for absorbing
the hit, the University’s senior
administration last winter
ordered unit heads to hold

3 percent of their centrally

budgeted funds in reserve-
On Tuesday, the state House
of Representatives approved

bills recommending appropria-
tion reductions of nearly 3.7
percent next year for Pitt and
Pennsylvania’s other state—related
universities (Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln). The state Senate
is now considering the’House’s

recommendations.
Schweiker had proposed an
even deeper cut —- 5 percent

— in aid to the state-related
universities.

In response to the House’s
vote, Chancellor Nordenberg
said: “Obviously, this is a very
difﬁcult budget year, and we’re
grateful for any help that we
are able to get from the state
legislature.” _

Assembly’s recent request that
employees and students be
granted equal access_to work
out at “The Pete,” Nordenberg
emphasized that students have
ﬁrst dibs on the center’s recre-
ation facilities. These include
racquetball and squash courts,
weight machines, a free—weight
area, an aerobics area and a
martial arts practice room. I

But Nordenberg did. not
rule’ out extending access to
employees, too, if a study’ of

student usage shows that such”

a move would not cause over-
crowding. At this point, no
one can accurately predict how
much students ‘will use the new
recreation center, the chancellor
told Senate Council June 10.
‘5We’ve never had a facility
like this one,” he said. “We’ve
never had a facility located at
the crossroads, really, of major
centers of student living on
campus. We need to see what the
demands will be and how usage
can best be managed, which does

' require experience.”

N ordenberg said Pitt admin-
istrators consulted with six
other universities that recently
opened new recreation centers.
“VVhen you look at the policies
implemented at-those institu-
tions, the one thing you cannot
ﬁnd is an equal-access policy like
the one that was the subject of the
Faculty Assembly resolution,”
he said. “Instead, what you
ﬁnd are policies restricting use
to students, imposing fees for
faculty and staff use, and/or
limiting faculty and staff use
to designated hours during the
day.”

Within the last year, Pitt
faculty and staff have gained equal

access with students to recreation
facilities in Belleﬁeld Hall, Trees
Hall and the Fitzgerald Field
House, Nordenberg pointed
out.

Economics professor Herbert
Chesler, co—chairperson of the
University Senate beneﬁts and
welfare committee that initially
pushed for employee; access
to Petersen Center recreation
facilities, said following the
Senate Council meeting: “The
Petersen Center is a major
showpiece and a symbol of the
University of Pittsburgh in" the
21st century, much like the
Cathedral of Learning was a
symbol of the University in the
2 0th century. To deny faculty and
staff open access to this facility
is, I think, an insult to us.

“However, having said that, I
am willing to grant our admin-
istration the beneﬁt of the doubt.
I hope that they will, indeed,
maintain [records of student
usage] so that if it becomes clear
that the facility is not being
utilized as extensively as they
would like to see it being utilized,
they will then say to the faculty
and staff: ‘There is room for
you, too.’ -

“And if the student utilization
is so high as to cause congestion
were faculty and staff afforded
the opportunity to exercise there,
then I can accept that decision,”

Chesler said. “The principal

users of the building should be I

the students.”

Barbara Mowery, president
of the Staff Association Council
told the University Times that
SAC has not received com-
plaints from staff about access to
Petersen Center ‘facilities.

ulty Assembly may press for

answer about same-sex beneﬁts

oes Chancellor Mark
DNordenberg favor or
oppose extending Pitt

health beneﬁts to employees’
same-sex domestic partners?

How, and when, will his
administration proceed on the
same-sex beneﬁts issue?

Faculty Assembly will press
Nordenberg to answer these
questions next fall, if the chair-
person of the University Senate ’s
anti-discriminatory policies
committee has his way.

Richard Tobias announced
at the June 4 Faculty Assembly
meeting that his committee,
together with the Senate’s ben-
eﬁts and welfare committee,
are drafting a joint resolution
for the Assembly to consider
at its next scheduled meeting
on Sept. 3.

The resolution, if approved
by Faculty Assembly, would rep-
resent the Assembly’s response to

a recent report by the University
special committee that studied
whether Pitt should extend
same-sex health beneﬁts.

In a later interview, Tobias
elaborated. “We’re going to ask
the chancellor to make a clear
statement of his own position”
on same-sex health beneﬁts,
he said. “Secondly, we’ll ask
him to tell us by Nov. 28, the
last scheduled Faculty Assembly
meeting of the fall, to report
what his administration plans to
do on this issue.”

During the June 10 Senate
Council meeting, ' Nordenberg
commented on the special com-
mittee’s report but did not
indicate how, or when, Pitt’s
administration will act next
on the same-sex beneﬁts issue,
except to say that he is discussing
it with the presidents of Temple
and Penn State.

After 10 months of study, the

special committee -— composed
of two representatives each from
Pitt’s administration, alumni,
faculty, staff, students and trust-
ees ——- concluded that “there
is no simple solution” to the
same-sex beneﬁts issue, and that
Pitt probably should offer such
beneﬁts eventually although
doing so now “would not be
prudent.”

The report warned of a pos-'

sible “harmful confrontation”
with the Pennsylvania legislature,
coupled with “a substantial ﬁnan-
cial penalty” because UPMC
Health Plan.likelywould insist on
renegotiating its current, three-
year health insurance contract
with Pitt. The contract runs
through June 30, 2003.

“At least two aspects of that
report were striking to me,” the
chancellor said: It was “very
thoughtful,” and committee
members endorsed it unani-

Former Pitt administrator
James Steele Gow Jr. of Allison
Park died June 6, 2002, after
a brief battle with cancer. He
was 83.

Gow was a graduate of Sha-
dyside Academy. He earned a
B.A. in political science from
VV1lliams College in 1941 and a
Ph.D. in political science from
Pitt in 1951.

Prior to serving in the Navy
during World War II, Gow
worked as a journalist. After the
war, he resumed his journalistic
career, serving as news editor
of both the Pittsburgh Press
and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
between, 1945 and 1955.

In 1955, Gow began his career
at Pitt, joining the faculty in
the political science department.
VV1th the exception of 1965-68,
when he served as vice president
of planning and development
for Bucknell University, Gow’s
academic career was spent at
Pitt. “He loved the University,”
said his daughter, Robin Gow

faculty and administrative roles
for over 2 8 years. His administra-
tive positions included: appoint-
ment in 1958 as head of the
Coordinated Education Center,
an earl y effort to link high schools
to Lll11\’C['S1t1CS to ensure C()nt1I‘1ll—
ous education; co—founder and
ﬁrst director of the Learning
Research and Development
Center (1963-1965); associate
provost (1968-1971); appoint-
ment as dean of the Division of
Instructional Experimentation
(1968); appointment as the ﬁrst
and .,only “Professor at Large”
at the University, enabling him
to teach in any department on
any subject he chose, and clean
of General Studies (197 1-1983).
Gow also co—founded the Univer-
sity External Studies Program.
He cited his position as
dean of General Studies as the
best, most rewarding job at the
University. Gow guided the
growth and adaptability of the
curriculum, introduced several
new programs (administration
of justice. legal studies, media
communications. computer’ sci-
ence and business accounting),
and established a faculty council,
a separate alumni group and a
student organization. Wingard
said her father loved the diversity
and commitment of the non-
traditional students he worked

. with as instructor, administrator

and advocate. -

Richard McDowell, president
of Pitts Bradford campus, praised
Gow’s efforts on behalf of non-

traditional students. “Dean Gow
intuitively comprehended the
adult student movement into col-
leges and universities beginning
in the 1970s,” McDowell said.
“He positioned the University
of Pittsburgh, as the dean of the
School of General Studies (now
College of General Studies), to
accommodate them. Thousands
of students in the Pittsburgh

rnarket anad"t-ihiiridreds‘ in "the

Bradford region were able to
complete degrees because of his
leadership.”

Psychology professor James
Holland crossed paths with Gow
during the contentious Vietnam
War era, when Holland was an
anti-war activist.

“Steele Gow was always the
person who could listen, who
could reason on tough issues,”
Holland said. “He was a real
team person. He never seemed

to operate with a lot of ego. He .

always listened to what -people
had to say. He was a mediator
and a real good citizen at the
University.”

Wingard said the value
her father placed on learning
throughout life was manifested
in retirement with his continued
proliﬁc reading on select topics
until resources were exhausted
and he was forced to select a
new topic. The University Book
Center became his greatest ally
in search of resources on such
topics as animal cognition, his
most recent passion, ahe said

Gow was preceded in death
by his wife of 53 years, Doris
Trayon Gow. He is survived
by three children, James Steele
Gow III, Robin Gow Wingard
and Donna Taylor; seven grand-
children; 1 1 great grandchildren;
two brothers, Robert C. Gow
and Don W. Gow, and two
sisters in-law, Helen Trayon and
Ramona Gow.

Following his wishes, there
will be no funeral or visitation.

mously. “Given the nature of
the issues presented and the
diversity of the group assembled
to deal with "them, I frankly
did not anticipate” approval
by all 12 committee members,
Nordenberg said.

“The report did not, of
course, please everyone,” he
continued. “And if it had, that
really would have been a miracle.
But my own sense,‘ from conver-
sations on and off campus, is
that people generally view this
as a highly responsible effort.
Certainly, it reﬂects the best
efforts of a group of caring and
committed individuals who want

this to be a warm and welcoming I

institution, as we all do.

“In fact, ,I think one of the
most telling aspects of the report
was the comrnittee’s expressed
concern that [unilateral] action
taken by this University ‘could
actually result in legislation that
would preclude the offering of
such beneﬁts by all state—related
institutions, legislation that
could eliminate any possibility
for any such beneﬁts for_a long
time here in Pennsylvania,’ to
use the report’s language.

“I share that concern, and
I also share the committee’s
belief that Pitt should work
cooperatively with the other
state—related universities .to
address this issue. In fact, the
presidents of Penn State, Temple
and I have been involved in
regular discussions of the issue. .I
have every reason to believe that
those discussions will continue”
— although “for the very near
term,” Nordenberg said, discus-

‘ ‘s'i‘orIs" among the‘ three ‘Will focus"

on their schools’ state appropria-
tions for the next ﬁscal year. See
story on page 1.

Following Nordenberg’s
report, faculty, staff andstudent
members of Senate Council had
the opportunity to question him
about same—sex health beneﬁts
(and other controversial issues,
including employees’ ‘access
to recreation facilities at the
Petersen Events Center) but did

not do so.

Meeting brieﬂy with report— 1

ers following Senate Council,
Nordenberg refusedto elaborate
on his comments. “I’ve said all
I’m going to say for now,” the
chancellor stated.

UPMC Health Plan ofﬁcials
have refused to comment on
whether -they would insist on
renegotiating Pitt’s contract —
a move almost certain .to raise
the University’s premiums —
if Pitt began offering same—sex
health beneﬁts.

But a Pitt spokesperson told
the University Times that the
special committee reached its
conclusion based on advice from
consultants VV1lliam M. Mercer,
Inc., and thatMercer’s advice was
“based on talking with people at
UPMC Health Plan.”

At Faculty Assembly last
week, Assembly member James
Holland said the [special com-
mittee’s conclusion contradicted
what a UPMC Health Plan
official told him when Pitt was
negotiating its current health
insurance contract.

Holland co-chairs the Sen-
ate’s beneﬁts and welfare com-
mittee and served on the Uni-
versity committee that advised
Pitt’s administration on the cur-
rent contract. Holland recalled:
“I speciﬁcally asked the repre-
sentative of UPMC Health Plan,
‘VVhat would be the impact on
our rates of providing health
beneﬁts to same-sex partners?’
He said, ‘None.”’

Each month, UPMC Health
Plan’s costs increase or decrease
slightly as‘ Pitt‘ ern'pl=o"ye‘es='marry,~
divorce, have children or other-
wise add to (or subtract from)
the number of plan participants
here, Holland pointed out.

Extending health beneﬁts to

Pitt faculty and staff members”

same-sex partners would be
equivalent, Holland argued, to
a small percentage of employ-
ees marrying and adding their
spouses to their coverage.

Chancellor defends Pitt’s

response to Hillel grafﬁti

hancellor Mark" Norden-
berg this week denied
accusations that his ad-
ministration responded apatheti-
c’ally to anti-Semitic graffiti
scrawled on the Hillel Jewish

University Center several weeks '

ago.
At Faculty Assembly on June
4, Richard Tobias — chairper-

son of the University Senate’s L

anti-discriminatory policies com-
mittee — called the Pitt admin-
istration’s response “bland,”
contrasting it unfavorably with
Carnegie Mellon University

President Jared Cohon’s ‘quick.

issuance of a campus memo
condemning the grafﬁti.

“All the University [of Pitts-
burgh] said was, ‘It’s not our
property, so it’s not our issue,”’
Tobias said. “Well, we think it
is our issue.” .

The Hillel center, located at
4551 Forbes Ave., serves both
Pitt and CMU students.

At Monday’s -Senate Council
meeting, Nordenberg said Tobi-
as’s criticism “simply does not
reflect the responses that the

[graffiti] incident generated

here.” Nordenberg» said he.

offered help and expressed his
personal outrage to the Hillel

V center’s director “virtually as

soon as we were made aware”
that someone had painted a
swastika on the building.

“A series of issues on the
CMU campus had led President
Cohon to draft a statement
that was essentially in ﬁnal
form”vby April 26, when Hillel
center vandalism was discovered,
Nordenberg said. “VVhen he
learned of the Hillel incident,
he was able to modify [his state-

ment] to include reference to‘

this recent incident.”
According to V Nordenberg,
Cohon offered to let him co-sign
the statement. But Nordenberg
declined — for two reasons, the
chancellor said: The statement
was “very CMU-speciﬁc,” and
one of the potential target audi-
ences at Pitt, the student body,
had virtually disappeared by the
afternoon of April 26,‘the Friday
before Pitt’s commencement.

Richard
McDowell

Pitt-Bradford’s
‘hometown boy’  
president looks back
on his 29-year tenure.

In 1973, at age 29, Richard E. McDowell took over the
reins at Pittk Bradford campus, becoming only the second
president in the institution ’s nearly 40-year history. Now, 29
years later; McDowell is stepping down to return to teaching
part time at Bradford, and to raise grant money and expand
the projects of the college’s Allegheny Institute of Natural

History, an interdisciplinary regional research center that he

helped establish in 1998. ,
McDowell, who holds a doctorate in biology from St.
Louis 'University, began his careeratPitt—Bradford in 1 970 as
assistant proﬁassor of biology‘ and clean of admissions. He served
as assistant to the president ﬁrr academic afﬁzirs from 1971
until he assumed the college’s presidency in 1973. _
“Originally, I came from Bradford and went to a Bradford

wouldn ’t have gotten the presidency without that connection, ”
he said. “So I get the presidency, and the ﬁrst day in that
chair, I sat down and I can remember saying to myself: ‘What
the hell do you do now? ”’ —

' On the other hand, being young and inexperienced
sometimes was an advantage, McDowell said. “I didn’t know
any better and was able to take certain risks in moving the
institution toward four-year status. But it was a wonderful
opportunity. I/Vhere else do you get the chance to build a college
and decide what direction it will go? ”

McDowell was interviewed last week by University Times
staﬁ’ writer Peter Hart.

University Times:'VVhat’s the ﬁrst thing you think
of when you look back over your long career as
Bradford’s president? V

McDowell: The early years were concerned with the
survival of the institution. Pitt-Bradford was formed
in ’63, and I came in as president in ’73. And in those
days, there was no money. The University actually
took the tuition taken in and gave us back only 80
percent of it. .

V The campus was in good shape in terms of having
good faculty. Don Swarts, the founding president, had
established a great relationship with the community,
including a fund—raising base.

- But you knew that the college, couldn’t survive as a

I feeder institution to Pittsburgh. So it was a matter of

ﬁguring out what the options were for the institution.

' This was the challenge.

So it’wasn’t always the plan to become a four-year,
degree—granting school? ‘,

Nooooo. In fact, there was no plan. Nothing. We
didn’t even do planning back in those days.

The campus was formed under [then-Pitt Chancellor
Edward] Litchﬁeld. VV1th higher education burgeoning

I at that time, there were not enough schools to take care

of the needs, and Litchﬁeld saw that if you have a pool
of students who could feed you during their junior and
senior year, you have a ' steady feed that comes into
your institution to ﬁll those dorms and classes, _and
ﬁnancially it adds to the viability of both the University
and the college.

Initially, then, the University established Pitt-
Bradford primarily to make "money?

I think so. That was the founding premise. But it was
very’ clear that a two-year feeding campus was not

going to survive. The demographics by the time I
became president indicated‘ that populations were
going down..The high school population was declining
precipitously. , .
There were two ways we could go: One was a
community college, staying as a two-year institution;
or becoming a four—year school. To fund a community
college, there’s a one-third local share that you have to
come up with. In order to raise enough revenue to do
that, you have to be a multi-county draw. The other
factor is creating technical programs, but that was not
something that Pitt knew anything about.
'_ And so my feeling was that the best route for survival
was to make Pitt-Bradford a four—year college. I could

   

The nearest institution is well over a hundred miles
from Bradford. —

We started four-year programs in ’76. I really give
a lot of credit to Steele Gow. (See obituary, page 2.) He
knew there was a greatemovement in higher education
for non-traditional students. This didn’t happen in one
meeting, but basically, I co—opted him ———- and eventually
he said to Pitt-Bradford: “You are now part of the
School of General Studies,” where he was clean. So
we got into these four—year programs sort of through
a back—door approach. _ -

Rhoten Smith, who was provost at the time, actually
suggested to me that we go to the Pitt Board of Trustees
and the State Board of Education and apply for four—year
status. We received four—year status in ’79.

Your tenure as president has spanned several Pitt
central administrations. How has the relationship
between this campus  ‘various administrations

. differed?

‘I think we’re, far more uniﬁed now. A university is
much stronger if schools are working in conjunction,
coordination and cooperation. And that’s what [former
Provost Donald]‘Henderson was able to create, or at
least to begin to create..Up until that time, we really

‘ were separate enterprises.

_I think there’s been a change in how we-view
each other. Don [Henderson] brought the deans and
presidents together. [Chancellor Mark] Nordenberg
and [Provost James] Maher have strengthened that.
Mark was clean of the law school at the time, so he was
right in the middle of that. Jim Maher certainly has
kept that same premise that the whole ‘will be greater
than the sum of the parts.

The ‘current administration’s attitude, I think, also
is reﬂective of the times we’re in, not just at Pitt. The
planning cycles in higher education are tighter and
resources are tight. So we have to zero in on what we
think is good or important and throw off those things
that are not important. There’s a plan for Bradford
and that plan has been signed off on by Maher and
the chancellor. , -

And it’s an iterative process. We annually update that
plan. We get feedback when I meet with Maher and [Vice

_Provost Robert] Pack about where we’re headed.

This isn’t true anymore, but it used to be at Penn
State that when burgers were served at State College,
burgers were served [at Penn State branches] all over the
entire state! I’m dead serious. Now that’s centralization!

The Pitt system is much more flexible than Penn
State’s. We have a lot of leeway in the planning and
the operational process. We hire our own faculty. We
run our own bookstore, our own food service, our own
housing. As long as we’re working within our plan there

' isn’t someone looking over our shoulder.

Obviously, we utilize people in Oakland and their
expertise when we need it. Computer systems have
become very centralized, for example, but I think that’s
in’everybo’dy’s best interest.

again in the fall. Any chance of you staying on
as president until a permanent replacement is
named?

No, l’ve thought about that. But no. There’s going
to be an interim president. I’m not involved with that
process at all. 'I’ve stayed out of it. Higher education
should be that way. Let somebody else do the selection
of the successor.

With an interim person, I want to stay out of the
way, and with the new president, l’ll certainly stay
out of the way. '-

You’ve said that you had-been thinking about
stepping down as president for a while, but were
waiting until the college was in good ﬁnancial and
programmatic health. Is it?

I’m leaving at a wonderful time. As far as our current
plan, the major projects are either funded or underway.
Major construction projects are set, and ﬁnancing
for the other projects is set. We still have to raise
some private money.

The other thing that went into my thinking is we
had some problems with declining enrollment, for a
variety of reasons, around 1998-99. We did not have
a consistent admissions philosophy. But enrollment’s

come back strong in the last couple years, as we’ve.

added programs and expanded the campus facilities.
Last year we had a record enrollment and it looks like
this year we will again.

Have the referrals, also called options students,
from the Pittsburgh admissions ofﬁce helped your
enrollment?

VVhen I got here [in 1970] all our students came
from referrals. We had no admissions ofﬁce at all.
My ﬁrst job here was director of admissions and that
was the beginning of going tint and recruiting our
own students.

Then, at one point, we took; no referrals at all from 1

Pittsburgh. The quality of stude' ts we were getting was
not good, I would say up until the early ’90s. So we said,
even though it’s going to drop our enrollment, by doing
that we’re going to eliminate some of the problems:
The students were not of the,’ caliber we wanted and
they didn’t want to be here. i ‘
Now, since Pitt’s been able to raise its standards, the
quality of students that they were referring meet our
criteria. So we’ve opened it up. We’ve said, e “If you

want to come here, ﬁne. But we
want you to come here for four
years. This is not a feed into
Pittsburgh. If you want to come
here and then go to the Oakland
campus, don’t come here.” And,
so far, the retention of our
options students has been as
good as that of our own area
students.

Admittedly, we’ve only done
this into our third year. But we’re
not putting pressure on kids to

come here. They could go to ‘

any number of institutions. So
it’s their choice. It’s not like a
second-class system.

Now, our application pool is
not at its highest point ever, but
it’s close. Next year, not even
counting the options students,
we’ll probably have the highest

application pool ever.

Pitt-Bradford has been ex-
panding with new programs
and majors for the last few
years. Is there a danger of
spreading yourselves too thin
and sacriﬁcing quality? ‘ .

  

That is one of the reasons
I stepped down. I think now
there’s a need to look internally
as to the next level of quality that
the institution is seeking, which
programs we really want to be
noted in, and what are going to be
the more reﬁned programmatic
levels. I think it’s more a case of
internal prioritizing.

We’re up to 26 baccalaureate

programs now, with two associate ‘

degrees. But there are no new
big programs in the hopper right
now. Part of that is because there
is interest and energy being
spent on the construction of

our new buildings, which will '

accommodate some of our recent
new programs.

How do you feel about retum-
ing to teaching?

I haven’t taughtin a long time.
I did participate in our team-
taught senior colloquium last

year teaching Darwin. Faculty-

were very kind to me. They

helped me say to myself, “Maybe

I. can do.  again.T’,...   

I’ve got a year’s sabbatical
[beginning this fall] and, honestly,
I haven’t laid _out my plans
completely. Part of it will be
catching up on the discipline.

I’ve found myself waking up
in the morning not worrying
about the institution, but wor-
rying about what I’m going to
be teaching. And that’s a good
change.

If there are misconceptions
about Pitt-Bradford that you
could dispel, what would they
be?

I think people in Pittsburgh
do not understand the beauty
of this campus, No. 1, and the
quality of this institution and the
quality of its faculty, No. 2.

We have been able to attract
very high-quality faculty, and

‘staff for that matter. Part of

that is that we are part of the
University of Pittsburgh. And
part of it is our approach to
recruiting faculty: We’re not a
“publish or perish” institution.
We want you to maintain your
interest in your discipline and do
research, and so if you want to go
to a small, college and teach and
still be part of a major research
institution, this is the place to
come. But don’t come here if
you’re locked in research mode
and you don’t want to teach, or
if you don’t want to deal with
students. ’

We want to attract faculty
who are mentors to students;
who can work one on one with
students and who enjoy that
contact. I think the result is
that we have produced a warm

Research shows children beneﬁt
from Early Head Start Programs

hildren who participated
cin Early Head Start pro-
. grams showed stronger
cognitive, language, social and

emotional skills than children ‘
in a control group of equal size, »

according to a seven—year study
conducted in Pittsburgh and 16
other U.S. cities.

Early Head Start promotes
healthy development of low-
income children younger than
age 3, and their families.

Besides beneﬁtinginfants and

toddlers, the federally funded ’

program helps participating
parents to become more eco-
nomically self-sufficient and
emotionally supportive of their
children, and less likely to hit
or yell at them, researchers
found.

Early Head Start ‘began in
late 1995. Today, the program

—— part of Head Start — serves
55,000 families (including 170
in Pittsburgh) -at a cost of $550
million annually.

“The Pittsburgh—based part
of this national‘ study involved
close to 200 families in this
area, half of whom were in the
program and half in the control
group,” said Carol McAllister,
the study’s principal investigator
in Pittsburgh and an assistant
professor of behavioral and
community health sciences at
Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health.

“This study involved the ﬁrst
group of children who went
through the program,” McAl-
lister said.

“VVhat’s very impressive about

the ﬁndings is how comprehen-

sive the positive outcomes are.
It isn’t just that children who

participate in Early Head Start
do better inlanguage develop-
ment. They also do better based
on measures of cognitive skills
and social and emotional devel-
opment.

“We also found that [partici-
pating] parents were more likely
to read to their children, to
pursue education themselves and
to be employed.”

The program had greater

positive effects on some sub-
groups (for example, African
American families and families in
which mothers enrolled during
pregnancy) than others, accord-
ing to study results. “The earlier
the better, in terms of enrolling
in Early Head Start, was one
of the important ﬁndings,” said
McAllister. ‘

Early Head Start also was
found to beneﬁt two difficult-

to—serve subgroups: parents at
risk for depression and teenage
parents.

Vivian Herman, Family
Foundations Early Head Start
director at Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Child
Development, said the study
“essentially conﬁrms what we
already believed, that the pro-
gram is making a difference, that
parents as well as children are
beneﬁting.’

“The fact that we can now
tell families, ‘Extensive research
has shown that Early Head Start
has positive effects,’ is helpful in
terms of encouraging participa-
tion. It’s also good for our own
staff morale,” Herman said.

McAllister and other
researchers have begun the
second year of a Health and

Human Services-funded fol-
low-up study of the same children
and families who participated in
the original study.

“We’re trying to see what
happens to the children after
Early Head Start, which they
exit at age 3. Some of them go
on to regular Head Start, but
some others don’t enter any kind
of pre-school or early childhood
program prior to kindergarten.
The followup study will see how
these kids develop right up to
the point at which they enter
kindergarten.

“We’re hoping this will .

become a long—term, longitudinal
look at these children as they
move along through school,”
McAllister said. ’

SAC president objects to
computer fee hike for staff

he president of the
StaffAssociation Council
(SAC) is protesting a

proposed steep increase in a fee

charged to staff who take classes ‘

at Pitt. Currently, all part-time
students, including staff, are
charged $30 per term for a
computer usage fee.

Under a recommendation
passed by a Board of Trustees
committee last month, the -fee
would more than double to $65
per term. The full board is
expected to vote on the recom-
mendation of its student affairs
committee on June 20.

-»..f:W§’I§.....Y€C0.E!11I}¢I1di_I}g.F113‘

either this fee be_waiveidifor'staff if

or at least it should stay at $30,”
staff council President Barbara
Mowery said at yesterday’s SAC
meeting. The fee for full-time
students would go up less than
20 percent from $110 to $130
per term under the student

‘ affairs committee proposal, .she_

noted.

Mowery is SAC’s representa-
tive on the trustees’ student
affairs committee. ,

‘.‘We get complaints from
staff about the fee to begin with,
since many staff already have
computer access at their jobs
and don’t ever use the computer
labs,” she said. '

The SAC president reported
that the student affairs com-
mittee, in recommending the
fee increase, reasoned that the
computer usage fee for part-time
students had not gone up in
several years; that Pitt had spent
considerable sums on upgrading
its computer facilities, including
providing e-mail kiosks and
upgrading classroom, computer
lab and dormitory wiring, and
that staff did not represent a
high percentage of the part-time
student population.

Mowery said that according
to ﬁgures provided by the Ofﬁce
of Institutional Research, 1,037
staff members took at least
one Pitt class during the 2001
academic year, accounting for
8,673 credit hours.

“That averages about one
3—credit course each over three
terms per year,” Mowery said,
adding that she did not have that
data at the time of the student
affairs committee meeting. “Now
we have data to show there are a
lot of staff who take classes and
have to pay this fee.” '

Institutional Research ﬁgures

also show that nearly one in 10 

of Pitt’s full-time staff annually
earn. $17,500 or less, Mowery
said.

“For those 9 percent of all
[full-time] staff who are making
$17,500 or less, they’ll be spend-
ing more for the computer fee
over a year than they are getting
in raises after taxes, based on last
year’s 1.5 percent increase for
satisfactory performance.”

Mowery said she sent a letter
last week to the administration
decrying the proposed fee hike
for staff.

 In other SAC developments:
‘ ° Two candidates are running
for the vacant vice president of
communications post — Angela
Peskie, Research Conduct and
Compliance Ofﬁce, and Rachel
Roebuck, Public Affairs — but
under SAC bylaws both are
ineligible to hold office until after
June 30, following completion of
their ﬁrst full year on SAC.

Elections chair Elizabeth
Homonai reported that ballots
will be distributed to SAC mem-

bers via e-mail and that the -

winner will take office ofﬁcially
at the July 10 new member
orientation meeting.

The winner will serve out the
term of Audrey Portis, who left
the University. Ofﬁcer terms
run two years.

° Mowery and Richard Col-
well, SAC vice president for
steering, reported on theannual
council of campuses, which was
held at the Bradford campus
June 5 and 6. .

° Gwen Watkins, chair of
SAC’s program and planning
committee, reported that ticket
sales have been brisk for the
annual Pitt-Kennywood Day on
July 27. “We’ve sold about 1,700
so far,” Watkins said.

T-shirts are available at 925
WPU for $6-$9.

Kennywood tickets will be
sold to Pitt I.D.-holders at the
WPU Ticket Ofﬁce until July
26. Costs are $12.50 per person
(discounted from Kennywood’s
regular price of $27.95) for all-

. day ride passes, or $5 for general

Tickets will be honored on

charge, and for a $5 additional

RESEARCH NOTES .

Physiological
changes during
pregnancy, _
preeclampsia
studied

Every six minutes, a woman
dies of a pregnancy complication
called preeclampsia, according
to the Preeclampsia Foundation.
Worldwide, the disorder, which
is linked to hypertension, leads
to an estimated 76,000 deaths —
30,000 in Africa alone.

Women who have experi-
enced the condition, also known
as toxemia, have an even greater
chance of developing the disorder
in subsequent pregnancies.

The results of several clinical
and basic science research studies
of preeclampsia were presented
by Magee-Womens Research
Institute faculty at the 13th
World Congress of the Intema-
tional Society for the Study
of Hypertension in Pregnancy,
which was held here recently.

Highlights of the ﬁndings

include:

Condition leads to increased
levels of sialic acid in blood
Blood concentrations of a
metabolic sugar called sialic
acid are increased in women
who develop preeclampsia with
preterm delivery but not term
delivery, CarlA. Hubel, assistant
professor of obstetrics, gynecol-
ogy and reproductive sciences at
Pitt’s School ofMedicine, and his
colleagues found. Preeclampsia
that takes place in preterm is
generally more severe than that

which develops later, and is_

more likely to be associated
with fetal growth restriction.
Elevated levels of sialic acid
indicate inﬂammation and are
associated with an increased risk

of atherosclerosis.

Blood samples were studied
from pregnant women who had
experienced preeclampsia in a
previous pregnancy. Women
were randomized into two
groups, receiving either 60
milligrams of aspirin, an anti-
inﬂammatory drug, or a pla-
cebo daily. Early results also
indicate that the low-dose aspirin
may lessen this inﬂammatory
response. 0

Preeclampsia heightens
risk for high blood pressure

Women who have had pre-
eclampsia appear to be at greater
risk for high blood pressure and
cardiovascular disease later in life,
Roberta Ness, associate profes-
sor of epidemiology and obstet-
rics, gynecology and reproduc-
tive sciences, graduate student
Patricia Agatisa and their col-
leagues found.

By studying heart rate, blood
pressure and forearm blood ﬂow
in pregnant women who had a
prior preeclampsia, women with
normal pregnancies, and never-
pregnant women when under
stress, investigators found that
having had a" normal pregnancy
was associated with a positive
long—term effect on blood vessel
behavior that was not present in
women who had previous pre-
eclamptic pregnancies or those
who had never been pregnant.

Smoking ﬁmnd to decrease
risk of preeclampsia

While smoldng during preg-
nancy has many adverse health
effects on mother and fetus, it
appears to decrease the risk of
preeclampsia, Kristine Yoder
Lain, assistant professor of
obstetrics, gynecology and repro-
ductive sciences at the School

of Medicine, and her colleagues
found. -

Uric acid concentrations in
the blood were compared among
women with normal pregnancies,
including smokers, nonsmokers
and smokers who had quit smok- ,
ing during pregnancy. Elevated
levels of uric acid are observed
during normal pregnancy among
smokers. Higher uric acid
levels also are observed in pre-
eclampsia. Uric acid concentra-
tions increased for all pregnant
women, but the rate of increase
was greatest among those who
had quit smoking at the onset
of pregnancy.

Other blood studies of preg-
nant smokers found that certain
cellular components associated
with blood-vessel activation
called ﬁbronectin, vascular cel-
lular adhesion molecule—1 and
intracellular adhesion mole-V
cule—1 were either reduced
or increased. Reasons for a
decreased risk of preeclampsia
among smokers remain elusive,
researchers said.

Vitamin C levels lowered
in women with condition

Even a mild deﬁciency in
vitamin C appears to negatively
affect vascular elasticity and func-
tion, Carl A. Hubel, assistant
professor of obstetrics, gynecol-
ogy and reproductive sciences
at Pitt’s School of Medicine,
and his colleagues found. By
comparing arterial pressure and
elasticity in pregnant and non-‘
pregnant rats that, like humans,

are unable to syﬁtliesiie vitamirfi‘

C, the scientists learned that
vessel stiffness increased in
pregnant rats when vitarriin C
concentrations were restricted.
Non—pregnant rats were not
similarly affected by vitamin C

restriction, however.

These results were observed
in spite of a natural physiologic
change initiated by pregnancy
that typically increases blood
vessel elasticity, which in turn
affects blood pressure. VVhile
researchers have long known
that vitamin C concentrations
are decreased in women with
preeclampsia, the speciﬁc effect
on vascular function remains
unclear.

New radiation
technique
promising in
reducing
treatment for
breast cancer

A new tumor site—speciﬁc
radiation therapy, MammoSite
Radiation Therapy System, is
now an option for breast cancer
patients with early and small
breast tumors treated at Magee-
Womens Hospital.

The new treatment, recently
approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, can
signiﬁcantly reduce the amount
of time patients spend receiving
radiation therapy because it
allows radiation oncologists to
speciﬁcally treat the tumor site
instead of the entire breast.

“MammoSite internally deliv-
ers radiation therapy directly
to the t11InOI‘ site where cancer
cells are most likely to reside,”
said Dwight Heron, assistant
professor of radiation oncology,
Magee-Womens Hospital. “It
allows for the safe delivery of
radiation to the breast in a
very shortperiod of time and, as a"
result, reduces the time, incon-
venience and side effects that
are associated with traditional
external radiation therapy.”

MammoSite is a type of breast
brachytherapy that uses a single
catheter inserted into the breast
following lumpectomy, or sur-
gical removal of the tumor.
Brachytherapy is a radiation
delivery technique that internally
targets radiation to a tumor
site. With MammoSite, once
the catheter is inserted, a tiny
balloon is inﬂated and ﬁlled with
radioactive seeds that deliver
prescribed levels of radiation to
the targeted tissue surrounding

V the tumor site. Because it is

targeted directly to the minor
site, MammoSite limits the dose
of radiation to nearby normal
tissues.

“MammoSite is an option
' for some women with breast
tumors that are small enough to V

be removed via lumpectomy,”
said Kristina Gerszten, profes-
sor and director of radiation
oncology, Magee-Womens Hos-
pital. “While not appropriate for
all breast cancer patients, it is an
easier and less invasive way to
deliver radiation directly to the
breast tissue.”

Gerszten added that before
MammoSite became a treatment
option, some women may have
opted for mastectomy (complete
removal of the breast) to avoid
standard postoperative radiation
treatment that requires at least a
six—week course of daily therapy.

Proper use of MammoSite
requires a substantial amount of
expertise and training for staff

Grant funds
study to stop
children's head
8; spinal cord
injuries

Researchers at Pitt’s Center
for Injury Research and Con-
trol (CIRCL) have received a
one—year, $68,000 grant from
Pittsburgh ’s FISA Foundation to
study the prevention of head and
spinal cord injuries in children.

This grant supports CIRCL’s

Think First for Kids Program, _ '

a school—based curriculum for
ﬁrst, second and third graders
that is focused on helping them
develop safety habits that mini-
mize their risks of sustaining
brain, spinal cord and other
traumatic injuries. Think First
for Kids provides enjoyable, age
appropriate activities that are
designed to be integrated into
school curricula.

According to statistics from
the National Center for Injury
Prevention. and Control, more
than 20 children‘ die each year
from playground-related injuries
in. the United States, and at

least 25 percent of all children

sustain an injury severe enough
to require medical attention,
missed school or bed rest.

' Additionally,’ more -than
200,000 preschool and elemen-
tary school children visit emer-
gency departments for care of
injuries sustained on playground
equipment.

“Our hope is to empower

children to think before they
participate in playground activity -

that might result in a traumatic

injury,” said DonaldVV. Marion,

professor and vice—chairman»
of neurosurgery at the School

of Medicine and director of
CIRCL.

In addition to providing head _

and spinal cord injury prevention
classes for children, CIRCL also
provides lessons on vehicular,
bike, water, sports, weapon and
playground safety. 0

Recipients of this year’s Excel-
lence in Education Awards were
announced at the School of
Medicine’s annual curriculum
colloquium last month.

The Distinguished Service in
Medical Education Award was
presented to Steven L. Kanter,
senior associate dean of the
School of Medicine and associ-
ate professor of medicine and
neurological surgery. The dis-
tinguished service award is the

highest honor in medical educa— P

tion given by Pitt’s medical
school. The award signiﬁes ﬁve
or more years of medical educa-
tion service at the University;
authorship of publications related
to the curriculum; teaching in
more than one course or clerk-
ship, or signiﬁcant administra-
tive responsibilities that extend
beyond a single course or clerk-
ship.

The Kenneth E. Schuit
Award, recognizing the dean’s
master educators, was presented
to James A. Shaver, professor
of medicine, and William C. de
Groat, professor of pharmacol-
ogy. This award recognizes
clinical and basic science faculty
for education—related contribu-
tions (teaching, planning and
organization of courses or course
sections) to the Pitt medical
curriculum.

Two new awards were pre-
sented this year. I

The Donald S. F raley Award
(School of Medicine, Class of
1968) was presented to Ross
H. Musgrave, Class of 1943,

executive director of alumni-.

affairs and clinical professor
of surgery. This award honors

individual achievements inc1ud— P
ing extended service as a student

mentor at the School of Medi-
cine, and signiﬁcant mentoring
contributions that extend beyond
a single student or group of
students. '

The Sheldon Adler Award was
presented toJohn B. Schumann,
associate professor of neurobiol-
ogy, for the development of
signiﬁcant innovative contribu-
tions to medical education at
Pitt.

Awards also were presented
at the colloquium‘ by ﬁrst— and
second-year medical students
to John B. Schumann, course
director; Gregory J. Naus,
course director; William C. de
Groat, lecturer, and Georgia K.
Duker, small—group facilitator.

Winning faculty members
were selected from ﬁrst— and
second-yearstudentnominations

to honor faculty and recognize,

their contributions and dedica-
tion to teaching in the basic sci-
ences and organ systems courses

in the School of Medicine.

Anthony Bauer, associate
professor in the division of
gastroenterology, hepatology
and nutrition at Pitt, has been
named the recipient of the Jans-
sen Award in Gastroenterology
for basic science research.

, “The Janssen Award is the
highest international prize in
this field, and the recipients

are chosen by a panel of senior ’

experts,” says David VVhitcomb,
chief, division of gastroenterol—
ogy, hepatology and nutrition,
Pitt School of Medicine. “Dr.
Bauer is the ﬁrst person from
the University of Pittsburgh to
win this award, and we are
proud that his groundbreaking
accomplishments are being rec-
ognized by the professional
community.”

Bauer will receive thejanssen
award for his team’s research
into the causes of post—operative
ileus, a condition that previously
confounded the medical com-
munity. An almost universal
complication of surgery, post-
operative ileus occurs when the
intestines stop working after
surgery. In most cases, the
intestines regain their function
after a few days. However, for
approximately 10 to 15 percent
of patients, post—operative ileus
can linger for weeks. Annually,
over 5 million Americans are at
risk. Treatment and extended
hospital stays due to the condi-
tion account for up to $10 billion
in health care costs each year.

Until now, it wasnot under-

stood why post—operative ileus

occurs. Bauer believed that it

nwas a" primitive response“ to

trauma. “In the pre-historic
environment, a caveman may
have been gored by a predator,
and it was advantageous for the
intestine to stop working to allow
for healing,” says Bauer. “Even
though a surgeon is performing
a vital operation, the surgeon’s
hand is probably interpreted
by the intestine in a similar
manner to a predator’s attack,
causingintestinal contractions
to stop.” ,

Experimental evidence from
Bauer’s laboratory has conﬁrmed
that the patient’s body sees the
intrusion as a major insult, and an
inﬂammation cascade develops in
the tissues temporarily shutting
down_ the organ.

Currently Bauer’s lab has

i been investigating the possibility

of enhancing the activity of

, anti-inﬂammatory pathways to

treat ileus, focusing on the heme
oxygenase pathway. Bauer’s

research has applications in other
inﬂammatory conditions includ-
ing sepsis, hemorrhagic injuries
resulting from automobile and
industrial accidents, and small-
bowel transplantation.

James Menegazzi, research
associate professor of emergency
medicine at the School of Medi-
cine, has won two awards from
the National Association of EMS
Physicians. _ -

Menegazzi won Best Scien-
tiﬁc Presentation for “Scaling
Exponent Prediction of Rescue
Shock Outcome in Out—of-
Hospital Cardiac Arrest,” and
Best Cardiac Arrest Presentation
for “Effects of Interventions
Prior to Deﬁbrillation in a Swine
Model of Prolonged Ventricular
Fibrillation.”

Menegazzi’s research focuses

on advanced cardiac -care by _

using information contained
in electrocardiographic (ECG)
signals to estimate how long the
heart has been stopped and to
predict if the use of automated
external deﬁbrillators (AEDS)
will succeed or fail. By using the
ECG signals, Menegazzi hopes
to identify which patients with
sudden cardiac arrest should
receive shock treatment with an
AED or receive cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) and/ or drugs
before a shock is attempted.
“The most common cause of

death in this country is sudden
cardiac arrest, with approxi-
mately 400,000 victims each
year. Menegazzi’s research has
the potential to greatly increase
the survival rate,” said Paul
Paris, professor and chairman of
emergency medicine.

“We envision that future
AEDs will have the ability
to advise rescuers, with more
detailed voice prompts than
today’s models, on whether to
deliver a shock or continue doing
CPR until paramedics arrive,”
said Menegazzi.

In 2000, the American Heart
Association published new guide-
lines for adult and infant CPR.
In the new guidelines, the AHA

acknowledged that the two-
thumb infant CPR, developed
by Menegazzi, was an acceptable
alternative to providing CPR
to infants via the traditional
two-ﬁnger method. Menegazzi’s
studies proved the two—thumb
method works better because it
combines simultaneous sternal
compression with lateral com-
pression, or squeezing of the
chest, unlike the two—finger
method, which uses only the
sternal compression.

The Blackboard‘ course management system has become a key instructional technology at the
University of Pittsburgh. Pitt's Blackboard implementation, called Courseweb, serves about half
of the University's 32,000 students. Since its inception in 1998, over 1,200 faculty members have
been trained in using Blackboard and they in turn have developed nearly 2,000 unique courses.

The Center for Instructional Development 8: Distance Education offers faculty training seminars
on how to use Blackboard and other tools to facilitate the creation of Web-base course materials.
The core Blackboard training is tailored to the individual needs of faculty by providing several
optional formats: standard (eight hours), novice (twelve hours with more hands-on), expert (one-
to-two hours with no hands-on), and online (one—to-two hours face-to—face with self-instruction

» via Blackboard). CIDDE also offers a refresher seminar for those who have not used it recently.

before City Council next week to
seek approval of next summer’s
construction.

Westwood also conﬁrmed the
streets to be re-surfaced in the
Oakland area this summer.

“The paving projects do not
have a ﬁrm schedule,” Westwood
said. “We need some ﬂexibility
because of weather delays. Each
project usually takes about two to
three days to complete, including
preliminary stripping of the old
pavement.”

Oakland streets expected to
be re-paved by city crews include:
South Bouquet Street, from
Fifth Avenue to Bates Street;
Terrace Street, between DeSoto
and Lothrop streets; Thackeray
Avenue, from O’Hara Street

paving planned

to Fifth Avenue; Bigelow Bou-
levard, from Bayard Street to
Parkman Avenue; North Craig
Street, between Bayard Street
and Centre Avenue; Melwood
Avenue, from Bayard Street to
Centre Avenue; Louisa Street,
from Atwood Street to McKee
Place; Ward Street, between
the Boulevard of the Allies and
Semple Street, and York Way,
from Bates Street to the dead
end of York Way.

None of the projects is big
enough to require nighttime
paving, Westwood said, which
typically is reserved for projects
with heavy trafﬁc How. Parking
will be prohibited during the
repaving, although the streets
will be closed to trafﬁc only
while crews are working during
the day. “In the case of some
of the wider streets, like North
Craig, trafﬁc will be restricted
but not prohibited during the
repaving,” Westwood said. “We
try to accommodate trafﬁc ﬂow
wherever possible.” Signs will be
posted at each site, she added.

VVhile the schedule for the
pavings is not confirmed, all
nine streets are expected to be
paved by the end of August,
Westwood said. “We try to do all
the projects in Oakland before
the students return for the fall,”
she said.

local street resurfacing, call
