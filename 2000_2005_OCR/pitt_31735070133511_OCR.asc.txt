New found friend

Pitt, CMU will combine their resources to foster

ERIC LIDJI ~-
Senior Staff Writer

From the Cathedral lawn you
can_ barely see Carnegie Mellon
University. But now, Pitt and CMU

are making efforts to reach across

the borders of Panther Junction.‘

In a press conference yesterday,
Chancellor Mark ‘Nordenberg and
President Jared Cohon‘ of CMU
announced the formation of a new
corroboration named the Regional
Economic Development Project, set
to galvanize the economy and job
‘market of Western Pennsylvania.

Nordenberg and Cohon appoint-
ed Donald Smith Jr., a CMU grad
and Special Assistant to the
President for Economic
Development there since 1998, to
head the project. His goal is-to coor-
dinate the economic‘. activities

between Pitt and CMU, focusing
primarily on using the high—profile.

departments of technology and

technological development and raise city retention

health sciences featured within the.
respective universities.

“We couldn’t be more pleased or
more excited,” Cohon said.

"‘[Smith] isan old friend,~and a
new colleague,” Nordenberg added.

Coming up to the podium with
his nameplate, which prominently
displayed the logos of both Pitt and,
CMU, Smith said that he wants to
make this position “the friendly
front door to the .univ'.ersities.”

Smith said\ that there were very
few people around the country.in the
same bi-campus position as him,
and “none of them can say they have

the _cash of resources under them as

I do now.” He continually referred

to his new position as “a whole,

greater than the sum of its parts.” _
This project will \work also

graduate students, to remain in

to “build the interaction with local‘
businesses” and to make_ sure that

Feeling the crunch: Pitt addresses classroom spacing

LAUREN UNGER
Staff Writer

Traveling through the halls of the
third floor of the Cathedral of
Learning, a student can move from
the elaborately painted Austrian
Nationality Room, complete with
velvet seats and chandeliers to rooms

packed with students using limited ,

technology and old, scarred desks.
This floor in particular illustrates
some of the wider problems that the

rUniversity faces in renovating old

rooms and eliminating overcrowd-
ing.

According to University
Registrar Samuel Conte, the biggest
problem the registrar’s office faces is
the growing demand for media
enhanced classrooms.

“This need is growing exponen-
tially while we can only work arith-

metically,” he said. p

Since updating the technology of
classrooms requires large funds,
money also slows the number of ren-
ovations that can becompleted. For

the 2002 fiscal year, 2.3 percent of ,

Pitt’s budget is allotted for facilities
and maintenance, according to the
2001-2002 Fact Book. About $1.25
million from this allotment is given
to the classroom management team
each year to completely refurbish
classrooms, according to Conte. That
amount means that the team can ren-
ovate six to eight classrooms yearly.
Renovations include a full makeover,
from new technology and computer
ports to the lighting and ﬂoors.

The classroom management team
considers a series of criteria in
choosing the order of room refur-
bishing. These criteria include how
heavily the classroom is used and

how heavy the demand for media is.
The team also tries to spread the
classrooms throughout the
University, and the most. recent pro-
jects include classrooms in the
Chevron Building,‘ the ' Music
Building and Posvar Hall.

Besides the problems in renova-
tion, there are some issues of over-
crowding. Andrea Sudik, a sopho-
more, spoke about her crowded
ethics class where there are not
enough desks. _

“Trying to pay attention to the

‘professor is difficult and side conver-

sations make it really tough,” she
said. t '

Lacy Thomas,.a junior, had prob-
lems with the many desks squeezed
into some of the smaller Cathedral
classrooms.

“It’s infuriating for me to have to
climb over desks every day,” she

said. ~

According to Conte, most prob-
lems in overcrowding are caused by
teachers admitting more than the
allotted number of studentslin their
classes and by the moving of chairs
from one room to. another. He also
added that overall class crowding is

' kept to a minimum: 75 percent of all

classes contain less than 35 students.

Classroom capacity is deter-
mined by suggestions of architects
whoporiginally built the classrooms,
combined with standard fire safety
regulations, according to Conte. But
as desk sizes continue to grow, the
capacities must be adjusted in time.

Overall, the improvements are an
ongoing process. a

“We are continuing to try to look
for ways to improve scheduling and
work with the various schools,”
Conte said. ,.

SGB members found not guilty for drinking citations  
District magistrate finds both not guilty, but a
one member’s judicial board hearing remains

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

One night in early October
2001, Pitt police cited Student
Government Board members Lonny
Fishrand John Algie for underage
drinking in two separate incidents.
Since then, the district magistrate
found them both not guilty in city
hearings. ’ / V

- Months after the initial citation,
no date is set for Algie’s hearing
before Pitt’s Judicial Board, accord-
ing to Neysha Sanders, Algie’s
advocate from the Pitt Law School.
The Judicial Affairs office reported
that it did not have a schedule of
any hearing dates available.

Algie’s citation resulted when
Pitt policeofficer Kevin Nemec
reportedly found Algie holding a
glass of beer in front of" his Delta

r Tau Delta fraternity house. Algie

maintains that he was operating as
the fraternity’s risk management
supervisor and presiding senior
executive officer, and therefore
wasn’t drinking. He added that he
had simply been moving the beer.

But Fish appeared before the
Judicial Board less than two weeks
after the incident.
acquitted him.

His citation came when. some-

one called the Pitt police ‘to report a
disturbance during a play in the
basement of the Cathedral of
Learning. “It was nice to see that
[the Pitt Police] reacted quickly,”
Fish said. V

The arresting officers in both
cases testified at ‘the hearings.
According to Algie, Nemec’s state-
ment contributed to his not—guilty
verdict. “When the magistrate asked
if I appeared intoxicated, he said
no,” Algie said.

SGB president Jeff Alex had
harsher words for the Pitt police

,and the publicity that these inci-

dents receivedithan either Fish or
Algie did.. “They were both
destroyed  then found not guilty,”
he said. . —
Neither said that he felt these
arrests affected their performance
as SGB members. “Every once in a
while, there would be a joke or
something,” Fish said, but he said

The Board‘

“It was at little ~
thing, a
small scale
thing.”

- Lonny Fish
SGB Member

the incidents go largely unmen—
tioned. “It was alittle thing, a small
scale thing,” he said.

Both Fish and Algie did express
concern that the police did not have
technical evidence against them.
They were not given Breathalyzers
or otherwise tested for their blood
alcohol levels.

- “It would have been better if
[the officer] had asked me if I had

0 ing

been drinking or Breathalyzedl me,”
Algie said.

Though Fish said that he repeat-
edly asked for a Breathalyzer test,
he was not given one. He said feels
that this contributed to his acquit-
tal, saying, “They needed scientific
evidence.” a '

Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney
stated that it is not standard policy
for the officers to conduct such
tests, though at times, -field sobriety
tests are given. .

“Do I want [my officers] to
walk around with 5,000 tongue
depressors and 5,000 tubes to stick
down people’s throats?” he asked.

Delaney continued, saying that
the Pitt police could potentially
conduct such tests through the
Pittsburgh police, which handle

DUI cases on campus. But, he said,"

the aim of such citations was to
steer_first-time offenders such as
Algie and Fish into alcohol educa-
tion programs.

Delaney said that he does think
about mandatory Breathalyzer test-

»“My guys are frustrated after a
long, hard night where everyone is
intoxicated and [they’re] picking
people off sidewalks,” he said. “Of
course I’ve thought about it.”

- Chancellor Nordenberg talks with\CMU president Jared Cohon before the two

men announced a new partnership between their neighboring universities.

Pa. governor says partnership will

ensure that future is invented here  

Pitt-CMU,_pa,ge 1

.Downtown, Smith willnow have a

new office on the first ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Learning.

“I expect to spend time in all
three offices,” Smith said; _ ,

Then Cohon, reading from a let-
ter by Gov. Mark Schwciker, called
Smith “a vital partner in shaping the
most aggressive state technology
agenda -in the nation.” The letter
also said that the ‘governor feels this
project_,“will help ensure that the
future is invented ‘right here ,in
Pittsburgh.” -

“So

spoke Governor

  Schweiker,’.’ Cohon said. ,“An‘d_I say, i

‘Here, here. _

Nordenberg remembered his
thoughts prior to the early stages of
the Regional ' Economic
Development Project. “You know,”
Nordenberg recalled saying to him-
self, “Pitt really needs a guy like

V Don Smith. Suddenly, Pitt does not

just have someone like Don ‘Smith,
wchave the Don Smith.”

Cohon credited Nordenberg with
the conceptualization of the devel-
opment project. “It was... like a
thunderbolt out of the sky,” Cohon
said. “A head—slapping moment:
What a great idea.”

Cohon and Nordenberg have
been acquaintances since the former
was just beginning as president-des-
ignate at CMU in 1997. This year,
Pittsburgh Magazine named them
joint Pittsburghcrs of the Year.
'‘‘Now, you can see the reasons

,._.

why,” University spokesman Robert

' Hill said. . ~ _,
' Nordenberg called the develop-

rnent unprecedented in American
higher education and noted “that
Lawrence Summers, president of
Harvard University, remarks on the
collegiate situation in Oakland, say-
ing that .“many areas of the country

would kill to have” the resources of A

two major colleges.

“This” is a very significant occa- ‘

sion not only for Pitt and CMU,”
Nordenberg said, “but also for the
entire region of Western
Pennsylvania. When we harness the
power of both, [we grow] exponen-
tially.” j_ _ _ P V ’
Nordenberg traced the ties‘
between the two universities back to
the 19,603 with the ‘Ben Franklin

Initiative,» which lead to Innovation

Works Inc., a nonprofit organization
‘created to increase job opportunities
for technology-oriented. start-up

companies. More recently, theﬂtwor .

worked, on an economic develop-
ment very similar to the present one
called the. Digital Greenhouse,
which Smith was also the president
of‘, . and the Life“ Science
Greenhouse, a $600 million biome-
chanical alliance betweenthe two
schools. '‘ ' T

“We each make our‘ own institu-
tions better through partnering,”

Nordenberg said.
And both universities want to

. continue this trend. ‘ ~‘

“These are just the beginnings,”
Nordenberg said.

1966 Pitt News side-
bar examines King’s
speech in Oakland

Editor is note: This story appeared in the
Nov. 4, 1966 Pitt News as an addendum to
another story running that day about the
Rev. Dr: Martin Luther King Jris speech
here.‘ In the interest of preserving historical
accuracy, it appears here completely
unchanged from the 1962 version.

Dr. King Confronts Questions
Friday, Nov. 4, 1966
By Fred Frank

Does the Negro hate the American Jew?
Will the election of Lester Maddox retard the
cause of civil rights? How is the war in
South Vietnam affecting race relations?
These were some of the questions ﬁred at
Martin Luther King while he was on campus
Wednesday. The working press found that
King ﬁred right back with deﬁnitive answers

_ on each subject.

The White Backlash ~

King claimed the California gubernato-
rial candidate Ronald Reagan “is seeking to
rise to power on the fears of the people.” “He
is a reactionary Goldwater Republican,”
charged the Nobel Peace Prize winner, “and
he is exploiting the housing issue.”

On the other hand, King felt “  ' 

could come fromevil if Maddox is elected
governor of Georgia. His victory will unite
Negroes and white moderates and willnot
hold back the. civil rights movement in
Georgia,” predicted King. ' '

The Vietnam War

"Ihewar plays havoc with our domes-
tic destinies,” exclaimed. King. He noted that
many of the programs that aid the Negro,
such as the Poverty Program, are being cut
because of rising Vietnam expenditures.

Commenting on the high percentage of
Negro soldiers ﬁghting in Vietnam, King

said, “It goes back to the basic economic ,

problem of the Negro. He has to turn to the
armed services to deal with these problems.”
King prophesized that the Negro soldiers
will return from Vietnam “with greater
determination for freedom and justice”
because they will have gained a “world per-
spective.”

Black Power

For King, black power is an unfortunate
choice of words. “Although I don’t disagree
with some of the concepts, Imust be con- '
cemed with the problem of semantics,” he
explained. “Ifit means the amassing of polit-
ical power for just goals, that’s one thing. But
the use of violence in achieving these goals

\ carmot be condoned.”

, The Rev. Dr. Martiri Luther King Jr.

spoke at Pitt Nov. 2, 1966.

King deigned newspaper accounts that
he was forming a counter-movement to the
Black Power group. “I feel a need to keep
lines of communication open even though I
must disagree with some of their principles,”
he stated. ‘W ‘ P _ -

Negro Anti-Semitism

_ King did not agree with the impression
made by a recent national television pro-
gram hosted by David Suskind. On the pro-
gram four Negroes from Harlem con-
demned the American Jew as the real source
of the Negro’s problem.

“Suskind was irresponsible -in putting
that program on,” King exclaimed. “I’d
never heard of any of those people before
and you can always get voices to say any-
thing.” ’ V 1

He further stated that he didn’t feel the
Suskind panel represented “the majority of
the Negro community.” .

“There is a revolt against the merchant
class and slum lords. Some Jews are now
caught in the middle of this,” King
explained. 2‘

King’s speech, page 1

“In the Negro middle class, con-;

ditions are improving, but the vast
majority of the Negroes are worse off
today than 30 years ago,” said King.
He continued, “If the whole nation

faced the Negro’s problem, we would ‘

be in the midst of a major, staggering

‘ depression.” __ _
Later on, the question and answer

period,qKing stated that one reason
why there are so many Negroes fight-
ing in Vietnam is because these
Negroes feel that the only path to
economic security is to join the mili-
tary.

A “massive action program” was
King’s solution to this problem. This
program is designed to end. blight in
the slums and to relieve the econom-
ic condition of the Negro. King
argued that such a program would
take billions of dollars. The only
question is, “Does .our nation have
the will to do it?” King seemed to
feel that the answer should be obvi-
ous

“If we can spend $24 billion a
year in Vietnam and $20 billion for a
space program, we can ‘spend the bil-
lions of dollars needed to put God’s
children in their rightful place,”
widespread

declared A King to
applause.

From the NoV., 1966 Pitt News:

Another prerequisite for the
assurance of justice and integration,
says King, is the explosion of
“myths” ‘common across the nation.
One of these is that myth that “tim
will heal all evil.” ’

“Time is neutral,” said King. “It
can be used for eitherﬂgood or bad. If
good people remain silent whi1e'big-
ots stand up and play on the fears of
the popular mind, time will cure
nothing.” ‘

Another myth attacked by the
speaker was the belief that civil rights
legislation is not useful because “it
doesn’t change the heart.” This is
partly true, said King. But he added
that “while _ morality can’t be
changed, behavior can be controlled”
Law can change the habit of men,”

‘continued the lecturer, “and, with

this, the attitudes of men will
change.”

King rejected the use of violence
to attain the ultimate goal of “equali-
ty of opportunity.” He insisted that he
is “militantly non-violent” and the
choice open to the Negro and all of
mankind today “is not between vio-
lence and non-violence, but between
non-violence and non—existence.” But
King also considers it an “obligation
to be firm when whites are more con-
cerned with tranquility and maintain-
ing the status quo than with justice.”

PERSPECTIVES

EDITORIAL

We still have a dream

On Monday, we’re going to have a
day without classes. But just like other hol-

V idays, the reason behind this particular one

has seemingly become lost in the fact that
it’s a day off. '

Since , elementary school, we’ve all
heard about the life of Martin Luther King
Jr. Many of us know lines from his famous
“I Have a Dream” speech. He’s among the
most recognizable ﬁgures in American his-
tory.

Few of us can forget the images from
his era, images of the struggle to ﬁnally
extend the 14th Amendment’s promise of
equal rights to everyone. -

We remember photographs of Gov.
George Wallace blocking the doorway of
the University of Alabama to prevent the
school’s integration.

We remember images of police using
ﬁre hoses and dogs against protestors in
several Southern cities. ‘

We remember seeing King standing
by President Lyndon Johnson’s side as he
signed a civil rights bill into law.

For our generation, these images seem
far in the past Yet, King was assassinated
only 34 years ago this April. legal segre-
gation was a way of life in many American
states until not long ago. Denial of the right
to vote and of the right to a jury of your
peers was a facet of life for many people in
much of the country. _ -

The very fact that King so quickly
joined "Abraham Lincoln and George

Washington in having a holiday for his
birthday is telling of the country’s
progress. The man who received constant
death threats and even had the FBI spying
on him — under orders from J. Edgar
Hoover — is now in our pantheon of
heroes. '

Today King would be proud of how
far our country has come since his era. But
he would teH us never to be complacent.
He would tell us that the struggle isn’t over.

Many forget that King also fought for
the rights of poor people. He believed that
the struggle against racial injustice is insep-
arable with the struggle against poverty.

Even though racism is less overt today
than it was when King was alive, it’s still
here and a major problem for many
Americans every day. Schools are no
longer segregated by law, yet so many of
our neighborhoods are willfully segregated
— and thus our schools too. There is still a
great deal of fear and animosity among
races. Racial proﬁling is a major problem.
Poverty is rampant in many minority com-
munities. f

So on this holiday, take some time to
think about King’s struggle. Try to imagine
what King would think about where we are
now and what he would say about it. And
most importantly, think about the world in

which you want your children to live, and .

what progress needs to be made in order
for that to happen.
King’s work is far from ﬁnished. -

It’s all for me

Bielak, page 6 ,

how harmful they really are. Sure, I knew these
weren’t exactly healthy for me, but’I didn’t real-
ize some of the effects. When I read that they
could cause seizures, heart attacks or even death,
I got scared. I threw my bottle of pills away short-
ly after.

I’ve also spent a good deal of money on a
variety of exercise equipment. Back during my
junior year of high school I was working at Sears
and decided to make good use of my employee
discount by purchasing my very own treadmill. It
may have been a great idea at the time, but I soon
lost interest and since then it-has only been used
occasionally, like that one day over winter break
when I felt motivated. .

I am also the proud owner of an ab roller,
Thighmaster, numerous sets of weights, a step
(for step aerobics) and a collection of various
workout videos. There’s nothing better than bust-
ing a move to Richard Simmons’ “Disco Sweat.”

I seem to be caught in the never ending cycle
of fat and thin, and sometimes I wonder if it’s
even worth the struggle. But I’m reminded of how
important it is to me every time I look in the mir-
ror or get dressed. I hate not only the way I look,
but it makes me hate myself. ‘

I hit a low when just days before Christmas I
put on my cute red winter coat for the first time
this year — and it didn’t fit. I wanted to cry and
more importantly, I was embarrassed. I had let

myself get Completely out of control and now I
was suffering because of it.

I realized just how much weight I had gained
and knew I had to do something about it. For me.
I had to make myself feel better.

It hurts every time my 17-year-old brother,
who is tall and athletic and has never had to worry
about his weight, calls me “fat ass.” It’s not his
taunts that get to me, but rather the rude awaken-
ing that it’s the truth.

I want to be thin and in shape again. I want to
be able to wear cute little shirts when I go out and
once again show off my belly button ring. I don’t

want to be self—conscious every time I sit down, ‘

wondering if my stomach is sticking out. I no
longer want to be appalled at how my thighs stick
out.

And‘ so, I’ve started working out again and

eating healthier. It’s not a decision I’ve made‘

because I feel like everyone else thinks I should
be thin, but rather it’s a step at feeling better about
myself and being happier. I’m determined to get
back the body I want and I know that it’s possible
because this is a battle I’ve fought over and over
again —- and have been able to win._
And I’m doing itgall for me.

Anti-Zionism is
anti-Semitism‘

Martin Luther King Jr. holds a
unique position both in American
history and world history. His inﬂu-
ence had impact throughout the
world, and he probably achieved
more for blacks than any other per-
son. He forcefully exposed to
America and the world the shame
and injustice of treating someone dif-
ferently because of the color of his or
her skin.

One fact that many people are
unaware of is that Dr. King was a
supporter of the Zionist cause and
declared so in a “Letter to an Anti-
Zionist Friend,” in Saturday Review
XLVII (Aug. 1967), p. 76. “Anti-
Zionist is inherently anti-Semitic,
and ever will be so.” King goes on to
say, “My friend, I do not accuseyou
of deliberate anti-Semitism. I know
you feel, as I do, a ckaep love of truth
and justice and revulsion for racism,
prejudice and discrimination. But I
know you have been misled —— as
others have been — into thinking you
can be ‘anti-Zionist’ and yet remain

 

true to these heartfelt principles that
you and I share. Let my words echo
in the depths of your soul: When peo-
ple criticize Zionism, they mean
Jews ‘— make no mistake about it.”

In a post-‘Sept. 11 society, it is
even a greater tragedy that people are
making absurd, unsupported and
hateful proclamations that “Zionism
is Nazism,” which should be identi-
ﬂed immediately for what they are:
anti-Semitism. I believe" that King
would agree and reject these state-
ments as simply being an announce-
ment of hatred toward the Jewish
people. These types of statements
mirror the propaganda heard from the
Nazis in Germany as a precursor to
their murderous acts during the
Holocaust. _ ,

We should all keep in mind when
hearing the typical declaration that is
purported to be merely anti-Zionistic
— either on the streets of campus,
Downtown, in a classroom or in- the
media — that it is actually a state-
ment that is racist and anti-Semitic.

Etrtaent  

      
 

PAGE 10

The other night, while trying to
procrastinate for just a few‘ more
minutes before starting my French
homework due eight hours later, I
happened upon an interview ‘with
The Strokes. Sponsored by America
Online, the “interview” was actually
just an excuse to play songs from
their album, Is This It.

Yes, that’s the key word, their
album. Is This It is ‘it’ for the band.

    

Pourqum?
and released it at the end of Leslie Hoffman
September. Aside from a single,
“New York City Cops,” that was removed from the
American edition of the album before its release after Sept.
11, the band doesn’t have that much extra material.

And it’s not that this is unusual; all bands go through a

-time when they have only one album released.

But Is This It is really big.‘Critics looove it. Is This It is
on most music critics’ lists of the best albums of 2001. It’s
No. 8 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 10 best albums of the
year. America Online advertises them. They’ll be on
Saturday Night Live tomorrow night. . ,

I have to admit, upon first listening to lead singer
Julian Casablanca’s sleepy, Lou Reed-esque rockstar
vocals,*I, too, felt that I was in the midst of a melodic
epiphany —— that I was listening to rock ‘n’ roll incarnate.
When I saw a photo of the band, I was convinced that they ‘
must know more about music than anyone else in the whole
world just because they dressed like they knew how to play
the guitar.

I felt like I had discovered something special and
unique, something that only I recognized the value of.

In November, I saw the band live at Nick’s Fat City.
Scanning the room of the of the sweaty club, with smoke so
thick I didn’t need to light a cigarette to feel the nicotine
rush, I saw hordes of Pittsburgh’s young and hip. Models
and black-clad hipsters filled the darkness, jostling for an
unobstructed view of the stage.

Suddenly, I didn’t feel so cool. If the band was already
selling out shows (in Pittsburgh, no less) two months after
the release of its only album, did I still think the band was
great? Were they actually great or was.I just a victim of
hype? -

, Somehow, now that I-couldn’t smugly say that I had
seen The Strokes without someone else asking “Who?” I
wasn’t really sure that I liked the band as much. By proxy,
if I think a band is special, and no one else knows about
them, does that make me special, too?

Next month, Weezer comes to town.

Not that Weezer has ever been one of those bands that
had a hard time getting MTV air time, but for a while they
held a kind of cult status. At least until they released their
weakest-but-best-packaged-yet green album last summer.

Now; when they come to Pittsburgh, they’re playing
Mellon Arena, the same venue that’s been occupied by U2
and Dave Matthews Band, as well as ‘MTV favorites ‘N

Are they still cool? Do I still want to go to the show?
Why am I so concerned with the fact that thousands of
other people like the same music I do? :

A I don’t know, but I’m calling for my Weezer tickets
b‘efore‘tln1ey sell out.k ‘

dren. Sometimes her staged photos look artifi-
cial and contrived, as in “The Toxic Calamity,”
where a blank-faced woman sits on a plastic-
covered sofa surrounded by vacuum cleaners
and cleaning supplies. V .

But the most moving and arresting images

are ones simply of families being together.-

They all have an outwardly Norman Rockwell-
esque element of warm togetherness, but there
is also a pervasive theme of isolation and lone-
liness. , _ ,

“John, age 47” is a striking photograph of a
man silhouetted against’ a tall, beautifully lit
and -decorated Christmas tree. The edges of the
photo are in deep shadow, but the tree glows as
if lit from within. The dark shadows and pin-

PCA’s current exhibit has artists collaborating

Collaborations: Double Vision

Through Feb. 10
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
(412) 361-0873

HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

Collaboration is a tricky thing.
Sometimes when "artists work together
they get great results. For example: the
joint efforts of the New York School poets
and the Abstract Expressionists. But, col-
laboration often has the potential for dis-
aster — another example: Donny and
Marie Osmond. , '

At the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts,
we ﬁnd “Collaborations: Double Vision,”
the fruits of a more local partnership of
members of the Craftsmen’s Guild of
Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Print Group.

Each piece in this exhibition is so var-
ied in intent and style from its fellows that
it’s impossible to lump the bad and good
together to come up with an average
score. But in “Collaborations,” artists
manage to work together to highlight their
weaknesses and their strengths, resulting
in some truly moving pieces.

This is certainly true of “To Forget the

. Extermination,” a hand-bound book with

‘ 

original etchings reﬂecting on‘ the
Holocaust. Artists Leonard Leibowitz and
Barbara Broﬂ’ Goldman pair drawings in
which lines swirl into each other and peo-
ple’s bodies are host to many lost faces,
with simple and powerful statements like
“Never again.” .

The pages are thick and hard to turn,
especially as the weight of the pictures
begins to sink in, and after the entire book
has been examined it’s almost a shock to
look up and see the art gallery surround-
mgs.

Words and art are not mixed so suc-
cessfully in a work by _a trio of artists,
Lauren and Sharon Wilcox and Tom
Norulak, in their piece, “I Am the One
Who Cannot Be Controll .”
While the etching and the
screen printing have been
well done ——-_ the images of
faces, teeth and trees of different colors
literally meld together — the poem that
covers this background is such a trite
‘statement of independence that it over-
whehns the original perspective of the
visual element.

ogy — from the wooden piece with pen-

of a more modern piece, to a plastic- and
coil-entwined piece whose ftmctionality
seems questionable.

Similarly, while the ﬁrst board is a
crude etching of the game piece, and the
second shows the game piece covering the
globe, the third board is black and, white
chaos, as lines run together in confusion.

You could say that an a11ist’s greatest
challenge is getting her vision from her
mind to the medium — quite a task for
one person. Just imagine how satisfying it
must be when two artists (like the

together, with results pleasing not just

themselves, but countless lucky gallery-

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE

In the high-speed world of busi-
ness, it often seems unlikely to find any
sort of feeling or emotion from the
given businessman. In fact, ﬁlms that
deal in it tend to probe the level of cal-

“The Business of Strangers” does this,

because it focuses on the world of busi-

But something seems to be missing

“Strangers” in their titles is that it has . - i

become instantly synonymous with

untrustworthiness, deception and the

lack of compatibility between the old

and the new. Or, as is the case with Paul

Schrader’s“‘T he Comfort of Strangers”

or Neil,-LaBute’s “In the Company of

Men” (or even Hitchcock’s “Strangers
on a Train”), they count on the down-

right duplicity and ruthlessness of a

“stranger.”

The only problem with this film -
director Stettner’s first —— .is that it
relies too heavily on peeling back the
layers of its heroines via long dialogue

scenes and forced

metaphors, a little more

stagy than cinematic. But

the performances are
‘ quite good, good enough
to recommend seeing.

And combined, with the authenti-
cally claustrophobic likeness of air-

ports, lounges and demographically ‘

pleasing hotel rooms it conveys,

“Business” succeeds in bringing us to a _

human level that eludes even the char-
acters at times, forcing us to acknowl-
edge that the people on the cell phones
have feelings, too.

Wrestling pulls out nrrow victory

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Staff Writer

Coming off a 2-2 finish at the
Virginia Duals meet last weekend, the
Pitt wrestling squad had plenty to prove
both to themselves and their opponents as
they headed to Cleveland last night to
take on the Cleveland State University
Vikings. The No. 20 Panthers responded
by edging out the Vikings 19-16 and
grabbing a solid road win as they head
into the home stretch of the 2001-02 sea-
son. -
Jacob Lininger got the ball rolling
early for the Panthers in the heavyweight
division as he scored a 5-2 decision over

CSU’s Russ Davie to give Pitt a 3-0 lead. —

The Vikings responded bywinning their
next two matches, as Rocco Mansueto
defeated Pitt’s James,Thorton in the 125-
pound weight class, and Cleveland

‘State’s No. 12 Phil Mansueto eked out a

2-1 decision over Shawn Arriistade.
Trailing 6-3, the Panthers -looked to
Blaise Mucci to build some momentum.

. Mucci was set to face Nick Boucher, who

is ranked 12th among college performers
in the 141-pound weight class. Mucci
responded by soundly defeating Boucher
13-1 and scoring four points for the

Panthers with a major decision.
7 Justin Giovinco, who ﬁnished with a
4-0 record at the Virginia Duals last

-week, kept his wining streak alive by

defeating Anthony Coleman in the 149-
pound weight division to give Pitt a 10-6
lead. - ‘

Pitt then started to pour on the points.
Zach Doll (157 pounds) pinned James
Greenwood to the mat at 1 minute, 39 ’
seconds to gain six points, and Carl
Fronhofer (165 pounds) kept CSU’s
Jason Effner at bay long enough to gain a
4-1 victory which extended Pitt’s lead to
19-6. .

But the Vikings did not show up to be
pushed around in their own building.
€leveland State’s Gerald Harris, ranked
16th in the 174 pound division, got a
solid 11-4 win over Pitt’s Matt Catullo to
cut the Pitt lead to 10, and Joe Phillips of A
CSU pounded Rob Black to score a
major decision in the 184 pound weight
class and ensure that the Vikings still had
a chance, trailing 19-13 with one match
left to go. -

Pitt looks to end losig skid against Georgetown

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

After losing two consecutive games with a lead

deep into the second half in each, the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team heads to Georgetown on Saturday with
hopes to end the skid. »

After breaking into the top 25 for the first time
since 1998, the Panthers yielded eight straight points

8 to Notre Dame in a 56-53 loss at the Field House last

Saturday night. Most recently, the Panthers wasted an

11-point lead against No. 24-ranked Miami on,

Tuesday night, losing after two overtimes.

The 76-69 loss to Miami was especially upsetting
because the Panthers had several chances to relin-
quish the lead, but squandered opportunities left Pitt
(15-3 overall, 3-2 Big East) with its ﬁrst back to back
losses of the season.

Contrary to Pitt’s latest fortunes, Georgetown
(11-5, 2-2) has won its past two contests. The Hoyas
took apart Seton Hall 84-58 Wednesday night and
crushed No. 22-ranked Boston College 70-43 last
Saturday. '

The Hoyas, who were ranked in the top 20 earli-
er this season, have a lot of talent and have faced a
much more difficult schedule than the Panthers.

Although they do_not have a win over a top 25
team, four of the team’s ﬁve losses have come at th

, Point guard Brandin Knight will look to return to

form against Georgetown Saturday afternoon.

hands of ranked opponents. The Hoyas have dropped
games on theroad to No. 20 Georgia and No. 9
UCLA, while losing games at home to Miami and
No. 10-ranked Virginia. Georgetown’s other loss
came on the road to a competitive Rutgers team.

-9~r—c-v.‘-9

The Hoyas can put up a lot of points, as they
average 83.3 per game. Kick-starting the Hoyas
offense is the trio of guard Kevin Braswell, forward
Michael Sweetney and center Wesley Wilson.

The wide-bodied Sweetney leads the team in
scoring (18.3 points per game) and rebounding (9.8
rebounds per game) nearly averaging a double-dou-
ble. At 6-foot-8-inches and 260 pounds, Sweetney
takes up a lot of space in the paint.

Sweetney ranks toward the top of the Big East in
several statistical categories, including scoring
(sixth), rebounding (first) and field goal percentage
(first). He leads the conference in offensive rebounds
and as if he wasn’t enough to bottle up, Wilson is
nearly seven feet tall and 235 pounds.

To balance the inside attack for the Hoyas,
Braswell takes control from the perimeter, as the
senior is putting up, 15.3 points and 5.3 assists per
game. Braswell’s backcourt mate, freshman Drew

. Hall, has also done an efﬁcient job distributing the

ball for the Hoyas. _

Pitt will need to play a fundamentally sound
game in order to take away a road win, as the Hoyas
are making 71 percent of their free throws, compared
to Pitt’s subpar 5 8 percent. '

The Panthers will also depend on Brandin Knight

Football playoffs can make you salivate

Football fans, this is the kind of against the Browns and 49ers, not in

weekend where you’re going to have
to tape your mouths shut to keep from
drooling all over your
inﬂatable NFL team
chairs.

Yes, I think these
divisional playoff games
could be that foaming-at-
the-mouth good.

For starters, you’ve
got the .Bears—Eagles
game (just going in order

of starting time here, not SPORTS VIEW

because of my allegiance
to the Birds. It’s still
funny it worked out that

my mind anyway. Those games were
the most exciting of any team all sea-
G son. ' ‘

And Chicago, as foot-
ball—crazy a town as they
come, finally has a decent
team to go crazy for again.

The New England
Patriots have to be a big~
ger feel-good story than
the Bears this season if for
no other reason than

No one knew Tom
Brady was good, at least

way, though).

Look at all the storylines in this
one. The two best defenses in the
NFC matchup, and it’s. a rematch of
the legendary Fog Bowl.

Donovan McNabb, who was an
All-American quarterback on .the
South side of Chicago, returns home.
The Eagles are 7-1 on the road this
year .
And as for the Bears, can this sea-
son be described as anything other
than magical? Not after those
improbable back-to-back wins

not that good. And he had
bigger cleats to fill than Kurt Warner.

Trent Green is a decent quarter--

back, but he’s no Drew Bledsoe.
Brady stepped in for the injured Hall

of Fame caliber si nal caller and took

the Pats from worst to first. He’s done
so well that the Pats actually look like
a Super Bowl team, and Bledsoe will
probably be in’ another uniform next
year.

The Raiders don’t look like the
same team they did at midseason, but
it’s never easy to count out a team

everyone already knew-
Brian Urlacher was good.j—

with Jerry Rice on it even if he was
on his way to Foxboro, in a West
Virginia uniform’ (I know it doesn’t
make sense, but I’m just doing my
part to spread‘ the WVU hate)’.

‘And Rich Gannon has some extra
motivation since he started on his
long road to success with New
England when they drafted him way
back in the late ‘80s. They never gave
him a shot and he’ll be looking to
show them what they could have had
and for some payback for the career
path they put,him on.

At long last, I’ve, been waiting to
see this since I, came to Pittsburgh —
the Steelers are in the playoffs.
Finally, I get to see how crazy this
town canget. “ x A

No more inept play calls by

Kevin 'Gilbride. No. more of “The

Graham Reaper.”
-And I’ve done more than my fair

.share of Kordell bashing, but I’m

now a firm believer he can lead this
‘burgh to the Promised Land. .

I’m‘ scared, though. The Ravens
look like they are clicking again and
they still have never lost a playoff
game. , V V
‘I hope the Steelers will end that

streak, and judging by their previous
performances against Baltimore this

‘season,’ it shouldn’t be too tall an

order. =

I don’t know how many of you
caught South Park the other night, but
I might start thinking like Kyle —' if
the Ravens win —- wondering how
there can be a God when good things
happen to peoplelike Ray Lewis and
Brian Billick. ’ C '

According to most of theexperts,
the Rams-Packers game is going to
be a stinker. The Rams will just have
too much Faulk and Warner for the

Pack to handle, and they’ll be on their _-

way back to the frozen tundra‘ by
halftime. '
But you can’t ‘rule out the Pack as
long as Brett Favre is around. He
could finish off the Taliban with that
arm and he\can single-handedly take
over a game. ‘

This one will probably end up ,

being the best of them all.
" Drool on, football fans.

Saturday to take on Big East rivals
the Mountaineers. Pitt (6-10 overall,
1—4,'Big East) and head coach Traci
Waites are looking to keep alive
hopes of the postseason by picking up
a key» conference victory. .

The Panthers are currently sitting
13th in the conference out of 14
teams, while the Mountaineers are in
the middle of the pack in eighth. Only
the top 12 teams make it to the Big
East Tournament in March, so every
conference matchup is critical. West
Virginia leads the all—time series 14-
12 including 8-4 at the Coliseum.

The Panthers are coming off
back—to-back losses to N o. 24 Boston
College and Rutgers and are without
the services of forwards Mandy
Wittenmyer and Sheila Stufﬂet.
Wittenmyer, a key contributor in both
scoring and rebounding, will miss
two to four weeks with an ankle
injury. Stufﬂet, who is suffering from

knee problems, is day to day.

’ But with their absence has come
the emergence of freshman three-
point shooter Haley Harguth. Harguth
set a career and season high with 21
points against the Eagles only to
break that record the next game by
sinking 22 points. She also hit a per-
sonal best seven three-pointers in
both contests.

The Panthers have been relying
heavily on the play of junior guard
Laine Selwyn, who had 17 points and
eight assists against Boston College.
Selwyn then recorded a double-dou-
ble with 16 points and 10 assists in
the loss to the Scarlet Knights. '

Senior forward Bettina Love has
stepped up to lead the Panthers in
rebounding the‘ past two games with
eight and seven. Love has also hit
double digits in points with 10
against Boston College and 11
against Rutgers. - ,

West Virginia and first year head
coach Mike Carey are sitting at 9-6
overall and 2-3 in the Big East fol-
lowing a 67-62 loss Wednesday night
at No. 21 Virginia Tech. The
Mountaineers gained 18 points from
freshman guard Sherell Sowho, but it
was not enough to overcome the

Although Knight pulled down eight

rebounds and dished out 11 assists

against Miami, he converted just one of
10 shots from the ﬁeld for five points.
