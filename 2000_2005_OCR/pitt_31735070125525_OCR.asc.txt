Pitt senior Teliah Walker pays for col-
lege through loans and earnings from
employment. Over the "course of her Pitt
career, she has worked as many as 60 hours
a week while going to school full—time.

When Walker learned that the budget
committee of the Board of Trustees voted to
raise tuition by 7.5 percent for the 2001-

' 2002 school year, she viewed the increase

as a challenge she was determined to meet.

“I have to graduate. Tl1at’s all there is
to it. IfI have to get another job, I’ll do it,”
Walker said.

The tuition hike would be the largest
percent ‘increase in 13 years. Last year, Pitt
raised tuition by 5 percent.

The budget committee approved the
increase at a meeting June 21 as part of the

~- University budget for the 2002 ﬁscal year.

The full board will vote on the proposed
budget on Thursday.

The proposed budget includes a $58
million increase in expenditures from last
year’s budget, with faculty and staff com-
pensation andstudent ﬁnancial aid account-
ing for.the largest increases.

University spokesman Robert Hill

commented that the tuition hike is‘ in part a

result of the amount of funding that Pitt
received from the commonwealth.

According to Hill, the University had
hoped for a 5 to 6 percent increase in com-
monwealth funding ﬁom last year’s appro-

priations, but instead it received an increase

of 1.2 percent. _

“What we’re committed to is improv-
ing the quality of the University of
Pittsburgh,” Hill said. “We’re in an expan-
sive investment mode, and in order to con-
tinuously raise quality, we needed to raise
the tuition to compensate for the allocation
of the commonwealth being lower than we
hoped for.” »

Hill added that though the amount did
not meet ‘expectations, the University was
grateful for the state fimding it received.

A 7.5 percent tuition hike translates to
an increase of $480 per year for in—state stu-
dents and $1,056 per year for out-of-state
students, bringing yearly in-state and out-
of-state tuition for Pittsburgh campus
College of Arts and Sciences students to
$6,902 and $15,160, respectively.

Walker said she wished that the
University would ‘Take into consideration

. the things people have to go through” to

meet the tuition raise.

“It would be great if all I had to do was
study, but it’s not like that for me,” she said.
Walker currently works about 30 hours a
week as an admissions representative for a
Downtown business school while taking
summer classes.‘_ ' —.

Former owner of C.J.
Barney’s arrested

‘CHARLOTTE TUCKER

Assistant News Editor

Former CJ. Barney’s owner Bernard
Silverman was arrested last week and
charged with 944 counts of failing to provide
workers’ compensation to his employees.

The arrest stems from an incident in
January 1999 when then—employee Jerome
Johnson sliced off the tip of his right index
ﬁnger while working in the kitchen of the
popular restaurant and bar.

According to an afﬁdavit ﬁled with
District Justice John T. Bender, Johnson

, missed 10 days of workbecause of his injury

and ﬁled a worker’s compensation claim
with the Department of Labor in August
1999 alleging the injury and the incurrence
of medical bills. ‘

Silverman was ordered to pay bills
totaling $482.75, but a discrepancy in the
accompanying paperwork led to an investi-
gation into Silverman and Barney’s parent
company, Stooges Restaurant Inc., which is
owned by Silverman. '

According to the aﬂidavit, Anna Geyer
of the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation

« Compliance Division discovered during the

investigation that Silverman was doing busi-
ness vvithout workers’ compensation at the
time Johnson was injured, a felony under the
Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act.
Geyer’s further probing revealed that

Silverman was allegedly without workers’ A

compensation insurance for a total of 944
days between January 1997 and February
2001.

According to the afﬁdavit, Geyer’sj

report said Silverman would obtain the

insurance for a while, cancel it, and then I
obtain coverage again. The aﬂidavit 

three companies from which Silverman

9 obtained coverage a total of ﬁve times, and
in each instance the policy was cancelled for ,

non—pay1nent of premiums.

The cancellation of the policies resulted A

in lapses in Silverman’s coverage accruing
to a total of 944 days. Each day he operated
his business without workers’ compensation
constitutes a separate felony offense.

This is not Silverman’s ﬁrst brush with
the law. On Feb. 22, CJ. Barney’s was
forced to close after a raid the previous fall in
which police and the Bureau of liquor
Control and Enforcement cited 121 under-
age drinkers and levied heavy ﬁnes. The

ﬁnes, in combination with taxes that forced -

Silverman to ﬁle Chapter 11 bankruptcy, had
become too much of a ﬁnancial burden.

After the February closing, Ken Steidl,
an attorney for Stooges, said the bar closed
because of ﬁnancial reasons.

“The rent was too high, they had to pay
those ﬁnes. There was just way too much
debt,” Steidl said.

Neither Steidl nor Silverman could be  

reached for comment.

 AIDS @ 20

es, college students’ use of protection wanes

Aftertwo deca

CHARLOTTE TUCKER

Assistant News Editor

Twenty years. .

Many college students haven’t ‘been
alive that long.

But something that seemed like an odd
coincidence 20 years ago — reports of 10 to
20 gay men sutfering from the same rare
form of pneumonia —. long ago exploded
into anepidemic.

Intl1e20years sinceAIDSjumpedinto
the national spotlight with those ﬁrst report-
ed cases, more than 450,000 Americans
have died and more than one million have
bee,ninfectedwithHIV;Andthenumbers
keep going up.

According to the Centers for Disease
Control, there are 40,000 new infections of
HIV each year. Statistics are showing that
afterﬂieinitialscaresinthe 1980s andallthe
hype about safe sex, college students are
growing more lax about protecting them-
selves. ’

“Because they hear about medications
that are available, young adults don’t fear the
disease the way they did when everyone was
dying ﬁom it,” said Nancy Commella, com-
munications director of the Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force. .

Commella said that the high proﬁle of
the many AIDS drugs, some of which can
prolong the lives of patients indeﬁnitely, may
have “led some young people to believe that
the risk of dying from thedisease is lower
than it actually is.

“Because they hear about the medica-

tions that are available, people may think
AlDSisnotas seriousathreatasitonce
was,” she said.

But according to Commella, the dr11gs
are by no means a cure, and many have
potentially crippling physical and psycho-
logical side effects, including anemia, liver
disease and depression.

'I‘he1ackoffearofHIVandAIDS may
be the reason students are being less cautious
in their sexual practices. A study of 290 stu-
dents conducted by Student Health Services
in the spring revealed that 40 percent ofPitt
students never use condoms. ‘

‘.‘I’d believe it,” said senior and Pi
Kappa Phi President James Angle, when
asked about that statistic. “I ‘have a ﬁiend
who just refuses to use them, and most of the
time he gets his way.”

Angle said that many people consider
protection to be the woman’s responsibility.

“Students tend to misperceive their fel-
low students’ use of protection,” said Shirley
Habemian, Pl1.D., Pitt’s health education
 Haberman said in that same
study, only 3 percent of students had accu-
rate perceptions of how many people never
use a condom '

“Ofcoursethisisofgreatconcemto
us,” Haberrnan said

Habermanalso saidthatinthe survey
90 percent of students admitted to consum-
ing drugs or alcohol, which are co-risk fac-
tors for unsafe sexual behavior. She added
that while under the inﬂuence, as many as
one-third of students surveyed had lmd sex-
ual contact that they later regretted

Haberrnan said that students must. pro-

tect themselves, not only from HIV, but also
from other sexually transmitted infections.

“Students need to keep in mind that they
can best protect ﬂrremselves by limiting sex
partners and using condoms during anal, oral
and vaginal intercourse,” she said. _

Haberman noted~ ﬂrat many students
who don’t use condoms practice what she
calls serial monogamy, that is, having sex
with only one person, but ﬂien stopping that
relationship and moving on to have sex with
someone else. Haberrnan said this practice is
dangerous because while the "couple may be
monogamous when they are together, failing
to use condoms with multiple partners
means STIs can travel between people easi-
ly.

But some good news did come from
Pitt’s survey. While 40 percent of Pitt stu-
dents may not use condoms, another 32 per-
cent attest to using them every time they
have sex. .

And while 9 percent of surveyed stu-
dentshad had sex with nine or more part-
ners, 73 percent reported having had three or
fewer partners.

The answer, according to both
Commella and Haberman, is education.

“Ifthereis awaytomakepeoplerealize
that the risk is out there then they’d be much
more likely to take care of themselves,”
Commella said. '

Educatingstlldentsisnotaseasyasit
sounds, but ﬂiere are ways. According to

Angle, fraternities sponsor member educa-

tion programs each semester focusing on
sexual health. Student Health also offers pro-
grams to classes and student organizations

conducted by a graduate student who dis-
cusses ST‘I prevention and contraception. ‘
Regular testing is also important. Today
is National HIV Testing Day, a nationwide
eﬂ°ort by the National Association of People
with AIDS to encourage all people to learn
theirHIVstatus. HIVtestsareavailableat
Pitt’s student health center as well as at vari-
ous sites in the community. In the past, tests

Chancellor Nordenberg, seated beside Children’s_ Hospital Pgesident

and CEO Ron Violi, at yesterday’s press conference

 

UPMC

said he hopes will begin with a ground-
breaking by Jan. 1, 2002. _
Construction will result in a new Pitt
Biotechnology Center, a new Children’s
Hospital inpatient facility and a Child and
Adult Ambulatory Care Center. The project
will include the construction of internal
walkways to connect the buildings of the
emerging “medical campus,” as well as

FROM PAGE 1

several green spaces.

Vroli said the project will provide the
nation’s ﬁrst “green” hospital, meaning it
will use environmentally ﬁiendly building
materials, and will incorporate large
amounts of natural light and green space.
The buildingwill also save a considerable
amount of energy and water.

Chancellor Mark N ordenberg was also
on hand to armounce the project,  it
as a success for the University. He cited the
aesthetic enhancements the project will
bring, as well as the new laboratory space
he’s hoping will lure top scientists — and
their grant money — to the campus.

‘Nordenberg said over the last two
years, Pitt has hired more than 60

their expertise and funding to the medical
school and other health sciences at the
University. He called Pittsburgh a “place of
special opportunity,” and said the project
will help turn Oakland into a “medical
mecca.”

Mayor Tom Murphy and County .

Executive Jim Roddey have also set their
hopes on attracting money to the region.
Both politicians bridged the partisan divide

and agreed that yesterday’s armouncement »

was an economically important one for
Pittsburgh, citing some 300 new construc-

tion jobs in addition to a hope for notoriety _

and grant money.

Roddey said the National Institutes of
Health has estimated that ‘it will soon dou-
ble its funding, and he hoped Pittsburgh
would get a large share.

Construction, while it will be limited to

a three-block area, is expected to inﬂame’

already tight traffic patterns in Oakland.
“We will do our very best to mitigate
the mess,” Romoff said. .
Nordenberg maintained that years of
constructionwill pay off in dividends of
medical breakthroughs similar to those
made by Jonas Salk at Pitt in 1955.
“The best news isyet to come,” he

acclaimed scientists, who have all brought said.

The cake sharing was part of an improvisation
class that the children participate in daily. The children
are also instructed in music and dance, and they
rehearse a play they will perform at the end of camp.

“It’s already the second day and they’re getting
along really well, just enjoying each other,” Critchfreld
says as he looks over the grouping of younger students
who are now playing follow-the-leader while imitating
different animal walks. “Our goal is to keep things
really fun, so the kids will look forward to coming to
camp every day. They enjoy themselves a lot more this

The child who delivered Critchﬁeld his imaginary
cake is Wesley, a button-lipped little girl who becomes
something of a ham on the stage. But when pulled
aside she can only nod enthusiastically when
Critchfreld asks if she’s enjoying the camp.

“She’s very talented,” he conﬁdes. “She loves
gymnastics. She’11 just do ﬂips and cartwheels all day.”

Down the hall the older children are in the middle
of their dance class. Their teacher is Maria Martin, a
psychology major and teacher who received her "ele-
mentary certiﬁcation from Pitt. -

“I used to teach musical theater at Maria’s moth-
er’s dance studio,” Critchﬁeld says. “I’ve known her
since she was a little girl and she’s always had a pas-
sion for dance.” A “

strutting ensemble dance, and the kids are picking it up

instructs Martin, demonstrating to the middle school
children an exaggerated strut complete with hip swag-
ger and shoulder dips. The kids laugh and quickly pick
up the maneuver. Before long the once-motley crew is
more reminiscent of the back—up dancers from a
Britney Spears video.

Critchfield hopes this new camp isn’t a one-sum-
mer only revue. He’s already making plans for next
year’s camp, hoping to double the size. He also hopes
to produce adult plays through the Actors Civic
Theater. ’ ~ ' _

The big production that will cap off the four-week
affair is “How To Eat Like a Child,” a musical produc-

. tion that Critchﬁeld animatedly describes as making

fun of adults.
“It’s just filled with silly stuff,” he says, “like how
children gross out parents by playing with food.” . '

board of trustees will meet on July 17 to

‘vote on the university’s 2002 budget.

According to an article in the Daily
Collegian, Penn State received $26 million
less in commonwealth funding than it
requested.

Consequently, the board of trustees
anticipated a tuition increase of at least 6.75
percent, which would raise Penn State’s
tuition to $6,988 per year for in-state stu-
dents at the University Park campus.

Consumer alert: a letter on
behalf of concerned students.

June 27, 2001

Via Campus Mail

Chancellor Mark N ordenberg
University of Pittsburgh

107 Cathedral of Learning
Pittsburgh, PA 15260

Dear Chancellor N ordenberg,

We are writing to you to voice
our concerns regarding the
impending tuition hike to be voted
upon by the Board of Trustees on
Thursday. While we recognize the
ever increasing costs of higher:
education and applaud the
University’s effort to improve the
quality of education at Pitt, we are
not convinced a 7.5 percent hike
(an extra $480 for in-state stu-
dents) has been justiﬁed.

A number of concerns come to
mind. For example, consider.Pitt
is raising tuition in order to offer
more ﬁnancial aid. Think about
that. It’s ludicrous to charge more
money in order to give more back.

Additionally, increasing
wages as an incentive to keep and
attract top-rate faculty is offered
as another reason. While the
largest funding increase would be
for faculty and staff compensation,
tenure rates are falling nationwide.
Pitt should do something to

purpose, but it hasn’t in years past.

counter that trend. Increased fund-
ing to faculty should serve this

Which leads to another major
concern: accountability. We didn’t
see the benefits of last year’s
tuition increase and now we’re
talking about even larger increase.

We the students demand to

know where the money is going. -’

When you buy a car, you want to
know exactly what you’re getting
for your money.

In fact, what other thing do
you buy that gets more expensive
unpredictably? And with little or
nothing to show for it? E

Show us the money. This year
in-state students want to get an
extra $480 worth of education.
Out-of-staters demand their extra
$1,056. Show us more and better
tenured and tenure-track faculty,
better undergraduate programs
and facilities and better advising.

And for our extra large chunk
of change, we best get a renegoti-

ated PAT contract for continued .

free bus fare. For that much, it’s
the least Pitt can do.

Very truly yours,

An everyday confrontation
, with racism

, College should teach us practical skills.
After three years of higher education I’ve got

I A more book knowledge than I know what to

do with. ‘

But recently I found myself in a situation
for which my education left me strikingly
unprepared.

How should we deal with
racists in our daily lives?

I was not raised to instigate

uncomfortable, and I avoid it

' whenever possible. But when someone

comes into my houseand hurls racial insults
around like they don’t mean anything, my
blood boils.

The person in my home was an invited

guest. Up until recently I would have even
considered him a friend. He has friends who
are minorities, and I have never seen Ku
Klux Klan regalia hanging in his closet.

But I watched as his baby face curled
into a nasty sneer and his easy smile mor-
phed into a look of contempt as he mocked
and derided a black television talk show
host. 
Watching «,_my friend undergo this
change, I alternated between a desire to yell
at him and a desire ‘to_leave the room rather
than bear witness to it all._ '

Yelling, of course, would have been the
more satisfying response -to his.behavior.’It

. would have conveyed my feelings about

what he ‘was doing, and out of embarrass-
ment he would probably have shut up.

But I can imagine the discussion that
would follow such an outburst.

He’d tell me I was just being politically
correct (a term that has become a dirty word
on par with the dreaded “1iberal”), while I

‘would vainly attempt to defend my position

using abstracts.

I’m not a debater, and I didn’t confront
him that night for many reasons. Desire not
to cause a scene. Uncertainty about his actu-
al motivations (was he a real racist or just a

product of our stereotype-laden culture?). A _

certitude that nothing I could say would
change his mind. .

I did leave the room when I was afraid
steam would come from my ears, but leaving
only made me feel like a traitor. Did my

‘ silent slink out of the conver-
sation make him think that I
agreed with what he said?

Would objecting have
changed anything?

I believe in the Kum Ba
Yah, make—the-world-a-better-place mentali-
ty, but some prejudices are too deep-seated
to ever be overcome. ‘

I’ve been there before. My own brother,
raised by the same parents who raised me,
had his brain kidnapped. He actually
believes that the TV show “Martin” is an
accurate picture of the lives of black people.
I’ve tried every form of lecture and discus-

sion to open his mind, but his ideas are set.

Only he can alter them.

I’ve never been a fan of being a mis-
sionary. The mindset that “I have seen the
light and I will guide you to it” has always
seemed heavy-handed and unnecessary.
Who’s to say that I shouldn’t just let my
friend continue to harbor his un-PC ideas
while I sit comfortably on my pedestal of
self-righteousness?

I don’t want to do that. And there is cer-
tainly nothing comfortable about racial mis-
conceptions, but when minds_.are shut,
there’s often little we on the outside can do to
open them. -

_Realizing that I can’t always change the
way people think, especially when their
opinions are deeply rooted in society’s age-
old misconceptions, was not a pleasant expe-
rience. ’

I’m left, in situations like the one with
my friend, to hope that some day he’ll come
around and that in the meantime he won’t' do

Giftedteducation not so special after all

I will never cease to be amazed by

. the number of people who simply

don’t believe that the rules or statistics
apply to them.
Turn signals are necessary (duh)

to let people know where you plan to‘

move your vehicle. Still, I’m begin-
ning to think that BMWs don’t offer
them with the leather package every-
one orders.

So I guess it shouldn’t be surpris-
ing that so many people want to tell

' professional educators — the experts,

if you will — what they want for their
very special kid. Their “gifted” child.
Have you ever met a parent who did-
n’t have a special or “gifted” child? I
haven’t. ,

They want special segregated
classes for their super—advanced chil-
dren. They want a special label that
means their kid can do whatever he or
she wants. Want to be the youngest kid
in ninth grade? Sure, no problem.

Nevermind studies on the effects
of tracking — segregated classes
equals long-term disparities.
Nevermind that psychologists have
long discouraged parents from label-
ing their kids. Nevermind anecdotal
evidence that living in a bubble fails

to prepare students for real life. What
possible expectations can you have if
you’ve never encountered a student
with an IQ of less than 130?

In , a three-part series,
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
detailed the delicate pol-
itics of gifted education
programs. The series
carefully detailed the
argument from parents
that their kids push them, not vice
versa. _ ’ ‘

But I was aghast by the tone and
attitudes that came with this argument
from so—called “gifted parents.” Note
the appropriateness.

For example, Ann Marie Breaux,
president of the North Allegheny
chapter of the Pennsylvania
Association for Gifted Education, said"
this: “There’s always the gifted
wannabes.”

This offensive statement annoys
me more than most I’d‘imagine, as
North Allegheny is my alma mater.
Yes, it pains me to admit it, but I went
to a rich, snobby suburban district.

From the articles it appears that
our Gifted Opportunities for
Advanced Learning program, more

the

SMITH

lovingly called GOAL is a model for
other districts, and a “gifted parent’s”
dream.

What a joke.

Essentially, there are two things
that factor in to your
admittance into the pro-
gram. First is an IQ
above 130 — the num-
ber that supposedly
indicates “giftedness.”
Second is a parent interested in

putting you in the program. Note:_

Actual classroom performance has lit-
tle to do with getting or staying in the
program.

Let’s digress and have a few notes
on the value of IQ testing as a form of
determining giftedness.

First,'there is quite a bit of schol-
arly discussion as to the value of IQ
tests for several reasons. What exactly
the test tests is debated. The five—point
margin of error (essentially the test
provides you with a 10-point range of
possibilities) suggests that the accura-
cy and legitimacy of test is question-
able.

Probably the greatest cause for
concern is the fact that white students
test so much higher than their black or

Hispanic counterparts. Does this actu-
ally mean that white kids are smarter?
Yes, the question is meant to sound as
ludicrous as it does.

To that end, some psychologists
have suggested that IQ tests may actu-
ally test your “white—ness,”' because
the test asks questions that may be
construed as culturally based.

Since I entered the district in sixth
grade, I will begin my tale there. In
the middle school years, GOAL meant
being “pulled out” of your English
class —- which was already segregated
by skill level — once a week or taking
an occasional field trip for “enrich-
ment” activities. '

Translation: You missed work in
your regular class to participate in
touchy-feely projects with a GOAL
teacher, who was, well, less than well-
regarded. ,

Ironically, because most of the
students in the program were identi-
fied early and because the program
has virtually no re-evaluation of your

.supposed advancement, there were

plenty of GOAL kids in my above-
average, but not most—advanced

Gambling

(U—WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -
Today I’d like to take the opportunity to
rave about the activity that remains

unchallenged as America’s favorite pas-

time: gambling.

Now don’t get me
wrong, I enjoy each sport as
much as the next guy. I just
acknowledge that without
gambling (and possibly
beer), these games would be barely more
entertaining than Chutes and Ladders.

Gambling is the spice of life. As
Homer Simpson once said — and I quote
very loosely, because I haven’t seen that
episode in a while — “Gambling makes a
good thing better,” and then went on to
compare it to putting sprinkles and nuts on
an ice cream sundae.

Placing a bet on anything suddenly
adds to one’s personal interest in the
event, and often- increases motiva-
tion as well. I once bet a friend
$5 that I could get at least '
half the score that he did on
a calculus test. When the
results were in, my 55 per-
cent was barely enough to

110 percent. Could I have _
mustered the ability to earn
that F without the added drive

Not bloody likely.
OK, I’ll admit that

gambling has an ugly side to it. Many lives
have been pushed to ruin by reckless and
excessive betting. But doesn’t reckless-
ness and excessiveness yield to disastrous
results when you apply
them to anything?

Sure, you could say that
gambling is horrible
because you heard about a
Mr. So-and-so who lost his
life savings by doubling-down on a 12 in
blackjack

But couldn’t you also claim that dn'- _ .

ving is evil because some hillbilly with
ﬁve gallons of vodka in his bloodstream
drove into a ﬁreworks "

warehouse just across the Indiana,/state
border, thereby blowing hirnse,lf'”and a
dozen Hoosiers into the stratosphere? I
don’t consider it fair (or wise) to judge an
activity by how its misuse’ hurts those who
misuse it. , "

Most forms /of organized gambling
are generally frowned upon and illegal in
most states ——+ these include casino games,
betting card games and sports betting. At
the same time, other forms of organized
gambling — such as lotteries or raffles —

-are widely ‘ advertised and considered

harmless fun or mere

  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
   

wishful thinking.

The stock market, which possibly
provides more opportunities. for reckless-
ness than every casino in Vegas combined,
has a reputation as being an arena of intel-
ligent decisions, insight and entrepreneur-
ship. One doesn’t bet in the stock market,
one “invests,” and these “investments”
don’t result in winnings or losses, but
rather yield different levels of “returns.”

The fact that NASDAQ has destroyed
more lives than the roulette wheel does not
seem to hurt the image of legitimacy that
comes with “investing.” .

It was with great accuracy that

Ambrose Bierce stated, “The gambling

known as business looks with austere

disfavor upon the business known as
gambling.-” -

I’m not asking you to push for the

widespread legalization of organized
gambling. I don’t have to. Laws
against gambling are so ridicu-
lously unenforceable that any-
one looking for an underground
poker game or a chance to place
a sports bet can ﬁnd one.
Opportunities to wager
are everywhere, but it’s up to_ you
to take advantage when you can.
So make the most of your solitaire
games, badminton matches and
cook ﬁghts, and put down your
stake today.

Serious re|ationships:worth the effort?

Ever since my sophomore year in
high school, I’ve had a steady stream of
serious relationships. The honest-to-
goodness truthis that I’m sick of it.

Oh, I know how good it can be to
snuggle up with someone '
you at least think you love,
to have someone to consis-
tently fall back on for
Friday night plans or to be
interested in how your day

went, but these reasons simply are not A

good enough to put the work into a seri-
ous relationship.

I used to think that when I got older,
I would be immune to the divorce virus
that has spread‘tl1roughout the world. I
thought that people were making the
mistake of marrying people they didn’t
understand thoroughly enough to love
or love thoroughly enough to make the
effort to understand.

‘ I thought that even those people
who married on practically a whim at a
young age could make it work out if
they tried, and that working it out can be
worth it; after all, my own parents mar-
ried young after knowing each other for
only a short time. ' - .

But then, to everybody’s surprise,
my parents divorced after --22 years
together the summer before I began my
college career. - \

Ah, but that did not faze me. I still

said that where there was a will, there
was a way. Marry someone you love,
don’t forget that you love that person
and it can work out. I thought that I had
the ' talent to be perceptive and under-
standing enough to really know a person
before marrying. A

I thought that in my relationships so
far, I had the ability to recognize a prob-

v lem and work through it — patiently,

with love — but also to know when
things had to end. -

But I made a dangerous assumption
that in more recent serious relationships

‘I found to be untrue: that my partner

will allow himself to be known and

_ equally desire to work through prob-

lems. _ .
In my most recent serious relation-
ship, I thought I knew the guy. I thought

he was crazy about me, especially if I ’

believed everything he said, which I had
no reason to doubt. When he suddenly
wanted to break up, it didn’t upset me
on any type of personal, emotional
level. _

l I did not feel that upset about losing
him. What bothered me was that I didn’t
see it coming. I didn.’ t see that aspect of
his personality at all, nor did I know

, what to make of the relationship alto-

gether.

The guy went literally from loving
me to despising me within a week -— he
wanted nothing at all to do with me.

So I misjudged him. Oh well. It’s
not as if I wanted to marry him.

about this decision. I wanted to do
what my friends were doing.

The irony was that I was doing
what they were doing. Though the
program boasts of enrichment activi-
ties, extra resources (a chess room?)
and opportunities for shadow studies
— a program where you follow a pro-
fessional around in his or her job — no
one I knew was doing much more than
I was.

Enrichment activities included
ﬁeld trips to do ice sculptures on tax-
payer money. And few students man-
aged to get a shadow study, since they
required, in addition to the normal
application process, teachers willing
to let you miss their classes every

All in all, the GOAL program
amounted to nothing more than a
fancy, elitist labeling system designed
to keep some students from accessing
some resources, like the shadow stud-
ies or from visits by college represen-
tatives from elite schools.

My GOAL friends didn’t graduate
higher in our class than I did, nor were
they better prepared for college than I
was, nor did the go to more presti-
gious college programs.

Katherine Kunkle, an eighth-
grade GOAL student, sums it up nice-
ly: “It’s like being part of a really big
club.” ’

any real and lasting damage.

For the near future, I only hope I
can find some way to respond to both
the outright racist comments and the
more subtle, subversive, but equally
ignorant messagesand attitudes that
stereotype and insult. '

My friend is only a symptom of a
much larger problem. He may not
belong to a white supremacist group
or espouse epithets, but his hurtful
and demeaning stereotyping can be
just as painful. I don’t know that it’s a .
problem that will ever be solved, but
we certainly don’t have to sit back

Timeless and nostalgic, Chabon’s
novel perfectly describes the areas of
Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, Downtown
Pittsburgh and, of course, Oakland.

“The Mysteries of Pittsb ” is
an important novel for this
University, and a must-read for its
constituents.

So as we, the current Oakland
residents, close in on the height of
summer, it seems appropriate to take
a look at some passages from
Chabon’s book, especially in light of
his recent award of the Pulitzer Prize

4 for ﬁction for his latest book, “The

Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and

ther into the national spotlight.

Ah, yes. Once again, one of our beloved
Pitt athletes embarrassed himself and the
University.

It’s almost like agame now — or
should I say a joke — among students. It just
doesn’t make sense. If you’re recognimble
and you represent something that is sup-
posed to involve class and tradition, then
chill out for four years and keep your mouth
shut

Of course, that’s the idealistic point of
view. .

It’s humorous now to gossip about the
latestescapadethatoneofourathleteshas
given us the pleasure of enduring.

And just when the buzz from one inci-
dent dies down, our athletes are considerate
enough to keep the dialogue going with an
even stupider display of charisma Yes, I did
say stupider — this colurrm is not for th
intellectual type. ‘

So, last week, Pitt’s wide receiver R.J.
English was amested for saying “f——— you”
to some cops.

here and there, but most of us don’t actually-

do it.

Robert, I will not chastise you too
much, since I have defended many of our
cherished athletes in the past

It’s cool that you separated yourself

. from your peers. You didn’t go out and steal

jewelry because that’s just tacky. You didn’t
park illegally or perform a classic hit-and-

it’s really commendable that you didn’t get

Pitt wide receiver R.J. English had his day in court yes-
terday, and as one police ofﬁcer put it, “He got off easy.”

On June 16 English was charged withdisorderly conduct,
a misdemeanor, at Donzi’s night club in the Strip District.

The police report stated that the altercation occurred at
approximately 12:40 a.m., when two oﬁ—duty ofﬁcers work-

V ing at the club at the time witnessed English try to jump in

front of 200 patrons who were waiting in line to gain adrnis—
sion to the Boardwalk complex.

The report indicated that several people complained and
when one of the ofﬁcers informed English to go to the rear of
the line, he became very upset.

According to the report, English responded to the officer
by saying, “I ain’t f—-ing going anywhere!”

After the officer ordered again to the rear of the line,
English stated, “F——k you,” and continued to stand in his

place. The report stated that the ofﬁcer told English that his '

behavior was disorderly and that if he continued he would be
arrested. 1 _ 1 -

. The ofﬁcer said that he ordered English for a third time to
leave and told English. he would not be admitted to the com-
plex. I ‘ . - i

The report states that at this point English turned around
and called the officer an “asshole” and walked up the steps,
ramming into a witness and forcing him backward.

According to the report, English proceeded to get into an
altercation with the witness,‘ after which one of the ofﬁcers
placed him under arrest.- I

The ofﬁcer’s report. states that English’s actions caused
public armoyance and alarm and that he continued using

Ricardo Greer during an Nl'I‘ game.

KENNETH PAUL

 

Sports Editor

After, four terriﬁc years at Pitt,
Ricardo Greer will ﬁnd out if all of the
hard work paid off, as he hopes to be one
of the 58 names selected at tonight’s 2001
NBA Draft, taking place in his hometown
of New York. ,

Greer is the only player in Pitt histo-

ry to rank among the school’s leaders in -

scoring (eighth, 1,650 points), rebound-
ing (seventh, 851 rebounds), assists‘
(eighth, 359 assists) andsteals (ﬁfth, 191
steals). .

According‘ to his agent, Warren
Legarie, Greer practiced for the New
Jersey Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers
but'all signs point to Greer not being
drafted. The best scenario, with regard to

playing in the pros, appears to be Greer
going to the Boston Celtics as a free agent

and trying to make the team as an

undrafted player. A .

The last Pitt player drafted was guard
Vonteego Cummings, who was taken by
the‘ Indiana Pacers with the 26th pick and
subsequently traded directly to the
Golden State Warriors. This draft is much
different from the one that Cummings
participated in. i .

The 2001 draft is overrun by under-

classmen. More than 50 of the players.

that applied for the draft left school early
and many are still in high school. It is
expected that there will be four high
school players selected as lottery picks

and youngsters Kwarne Brown‘ and ’

Tyson Chandler are forecasted to be

leaves team;
Pederson to Kansas?

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor I

There is plenty of news this week
in Pitt sports. Rumors about the pos-
sible departure of athletic director
Steve Pederson began to surface. A
Pitt basketball player left the team,
and Pitt basketball’s new schedule
was released.

- The Kansas City Star reported
that Pitt athletic director Steve
Pederson is a potential candidate for
the vacant athletic director position
at the University of Kansas.

The position opened on April 26
when Bob Frederick resigned as the
Jayhawks’ athletic director. Pederson
was an associate athletic director at
Nebraska before he came to Pitt in
the fall of 1996, and the job ,
would bring him closer to
home, since he and his

average of 30.3 points per game.
Stevanovic was rated the “Best
Outside Shooter” among the incom-

9 ing junior college recruits by The

Sporting News. i

As a forward, -Stevanovic got off
to a solid start at the beginning of-the
season, putting up 16 points in the
opener against North Carolina A&T
State and 12 points_ against Morris

Brown. But as the season progressed ‘

his playing time became erratic and,
at times, infrequent.
_ Stevanovic finished the season
averaging 4.8 points per game, but he
fell out of favor with Howland
toward the end of the season. He did-
n’t play one minute in the Big East
Tournament until ‘the championship
game, when Boston College had built
its lead to 22 points.
He will be eligible to play next
season if he goes to a Division II
or III team, but if he choos-
es to play Division I has-

by changing the colors

changed the look of the campus by

will house the men’s and women’s
basketball teams.

He established state—of-the-art
facilities for the football team by cre-

ating the Duratz Athletic Complex_

and the UPMC Sports Performance
Complex. '

Finally, on Sept. 1, he will see his
biggest orchestrated change come to
fruition, when thefootball _team plays
its first game at Heinz Field.

/0? After playing just one season on
the men’s basketball team, forward
Zelemir Stevanovic decided to trans-

fer from Pitt.

Stevanovic came to Pitt last. sea-

son from Gulf Coast Community.

College. The Yugoslavian was touted
as a scorer; he led the National Junior
College Athletic Association with an

Sponrss 

during the 2002 sea-
‘son.
The team is coming
off its most successful season
in a decade, posting a 19-14 record
and a "berth in the National
Invitational Tournament. '
Pitt plays in the Big East West
Division, ’ which consists of

Georgetown, Notre Dame, Rutgers,’

Seton Hall, . Syracuse and West
Virginia. Pitt will play each team
twice, once at home and once away.

The Panthers’ additional confer-
ence games will be against four
teams from the East Division. Boston
College, . Connecticut, Miami,
Providence, St; John’s, Virginia Tech
and Villanova make up the East.

From the East, Pitt will host St.-

John’s and Villanova and will travel
to Boston College and Miami. Dates

and times will be announced at a later 

date. _ ,
A This marks the second season
that the Big East will feature two

teams in each division will advance

Burn the ballots, no

Many all-star games are consid-
ered jokes to some, but perhaps none
more than Major League Baseball’s.

The purpose of the game used to
be to recognize those players who
were having outstanding seasons.
For some, it was a once in a lifetime
opportunity to rise to the top of the
baseball world. But the game has
changed, and now those players who
may be having that one great year of
their career are lost in the shufﬂe of
big names and even bigger bucks.

When the MLB‘ All-Star game‘ is
played in just a few weeks, it will
showcase many players who deserve
to be there, but also a number select-
ed based not on performance but
popularity. Fan voting corrupts the
selection process, ensuring that at
least one superstar who is having a

horrible year will be voted onto the
team. This season proves to be no

different.

Once again, Cal Ripken Jr. leads
American League third basemen with
429,525 votes. Ripken, a future Hall
of Famer known best for his 2,632
consecutive games played, has been
a deserving All-Star many times in
his career, but his numbers this year
are anything but stellar.

He is hitting just .210 with four
home runs and 25 RBIs, and has
announced that he will retire at the

. -end of the season. He is no longer
that player he used to be, and there-

fore no longer deserves to be a start-
ing All-Star. _
Instead, the starting nod should

1 go to Angels third baseman Troy

Glaus, who trails Ripken by less than
8,000 votes. Glaus is batting .265‘
with 18 home runs and 46 RBIs, and
while his average may not be all that
impressive, it is much more
respectable than Ripken’s. Glaus was
also the backup to Ripken a year ago,

despite hitting @284 with 47 home A

runs and 102 RBIs.

What is also a bit confusing is
how Boston’s Nomar Garciaparra
picked up 212,976 votes. While he, is
fifth among AL shortstops, he has not
played once this entire season, and
therefore has in no way proved he is
worthy of All-Star recognition. It’s
sad when fans cannot even vote for‘
someone who is actually playing the
game. ~
In the National League, Mike
Piazza leads ‘catchers with 679,287
votes. This comes as no surprise.
since Piazza is one of the best hitting
catchers in the history of the game,
but he is certainly not having a good

, year (.270, 19 home runs, 43 RBIs).

Yet he leads the second place catch-
er, Charles Johnson (.284, 12 home
runs, 41 - RBIs), by more than
500,000 Votes.

But the real mind—boggler in the

NL comes in the outfield. Ken
Griffey Jr.-, a man who has just 25 at-
bats the entire season, has a chance
to make the starting line- .
up at this year’s All-Star P ‘
game.
He spent much of the sea-
son on the injured list, and
when he does play, he is ,
unproductive, hitting .200 -
with no home runs and just
three RBIs. Griffey is cur-
rently fourth among NL
outfielders, about 1,000
votes away from Luis
Gonzalez, who holds third
place. Meanwhile, Gonzalez
is having another tremendous season

in-Arizona, hitting .356 with 28
home runs and 62 RBIs.
How anyone could vote for

Griffey over Gonzalez is
‘w beyond me, but today’s
.baseball fans are brain~
washed to follow stars like
_ Griffey, and will fill the bal-
 lots with his name. Barry
 Bonds and Sammy Sosa
 have secured the No. 1 and
 No. 2 spots, so now the
race is on between
Gonzalez and Griffey for
the final position in the
starting lineup.
Griffey does

   
  
  
      
 

Karen Bielak

not

deserve to be anywhere near the _

game, let alone be voted in as a
starter.

The All-Star game has become
such a joke that many true baseball
fans no longer even have an interest
in it. Voting needs to be taken away
from the fans with the hope that a
small amount of fairness can be
brought back. Some measure needs
to be taken to ensure that players
with nonexistent statistics are not
being honored as one of the sport’s
best.

Karen Bielak is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News and hates the
All-Star break because it means three
days without real baseball.

shorts.

No one wants to wait in line behind 200
people, and anyone with a clue has skipped
in ﬁont of people before. -

Now I’m not saying that I know every-

‘thing, but my inclination is that your judg-

ment was slighﬂy impaired when you cursed
at the officers. I don’t think it’s so bad that
you said “f—— you” the ﬁrst time, and the
second time you cursed at them could have
been viewed as a simple slip of the tongue.
Myhunchisthatthethirdtimeyoucursedat
the cops and called one of them an “asshole”
might have been the mistake. But that’s just
my observation, I could be wrong.

My question to Walt Harris and the ath-
letic department is what should be done? The
athletic department released a statement say-

the hell that means?

My opinion,_ which I can give because
thisisanopinionscolurrm,isthatthe
University thought the incident would fade
quickly like many buzzes of the past, but I’m
not so sure that it will. This isn’t a guy smok-
ing ajoint, not that I think a guy sho11ld be
kicked off of a team for smoking pot.

If you can smoke the defensive end
across from you, then I don’t care what
you’re smoking in your spare time.

But this is kind of a weird situation.

This is acasewhere ap1ayermadehim-
self look like a jerk in public, and if Harris
doesn’t confront the situation publicly, then I
think we all know What handling the situa-
tion intemally means.

. It would probably mean that Harris feels
he looked “stem” in suspending Antonio

Khiawatha Downey for a season, his track
record for being a “tough” reprimander is
proven —— Harris can Band-Aid the English
situation with his own reputation.

I think not. The people now know, Walt.
It’s time for you to check in and let us know
where you stand.

Everyone makes mistakes when they’re
young, and I hope English comes back ﬁom
his knee injury and has the season that he’s
capable of having. But people must be held
accountable for their mistakes — there
should be no plea bargains on the football
ﬁeld.

Kenneth Paul is the sports editor for The Pitt
News and he would have chosen to go to
Area 51 or the Lava lounge rather than
Donzifs’.

The number of underclassmen is not
the only hurdle for Greer. At the height of
6 feet 5 inches, Greer does not ﬁt the

I mold of any particularposition. '

Critics say Greer, who usually
played small forward in college, is too
small to play the position at the next level
and too slow to keep up with the quick
NBA guards. Many pre-draft publica-
tions also question Greer’s ability to cre-

ate his own shot as well as his perimeter .

shooting.

Greer was named the Big East Most
Improved Player in his junior season and
he ﬁnished last season averaging 16.5
points and 7.6 rebounds per game. He led
the team in scoring in 16 out of the 26
games that he played in.

If the NBA doesn’t pan out for Greer,
there is plenty of opportunity for him
overseas. Legarie is in Italy right now
working for Greer, and there has been
Contact between Legarie and teams in
Spain. '

Greer does have international experi-
ence. He represented the Dominican
Republic team twice and during the sum-
mer of 1999 he helped the team to a
bronze medal in the Central American
Games.

The two-time second team Al1—Big
East selection is currently playing in a
Pro-Am basketball league in New York,
competing against the likes of veteran-
NBA players Mark Jackson and Stephon
Marbury. Greer is the only player in Pitt
history to ‘score 1,000 points, 500

_ rebounds and 300 assists. ‘

There -are several other Big East
players who should expect to hear their
names called tonight.

Seton Hall’s Eddie Griffin, who
would be a sophomore, is expected to be
a Top 5 pick and Notre Darne’s Troy
Murphy should ﬁnd his way into the Top
10. Villanova’s Michael Bradley is

expected to go early and their are several .

other hopefuls including Georgetown’s
Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, Syracuse’s
Darnone Brown, Providence’s Karim
Shabazz and St. John’s Omar Cook.

ENGLISH

spent a night in jail for the incident,
won’t be penalized with less playing
time.

The 6-foot—3 inch, 215-pound wide
receiver is one of the fastest players on
the team and was an important part of
the receiving corps last season before
injuring his right knee in the ninth week
of the season.

FROM PAGE 14

In the eight games he played last '
. season, he made 15 catches for 326

yards, with three touchdowns. English
missed spring drills because of rehabili-
tation for his knee injury, but is expect-
ed to be healthy for training camp.
