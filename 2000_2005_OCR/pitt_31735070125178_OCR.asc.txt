Salaries

' The 4.5 percent increase in-
‘ the compensation base will be

allocated to cost-of—living and
merit raises," as well as market
and equity adjustments.

‘ How the 4.5 percent increase

will be distributed among those

components will be determined
by the senior administration later
this summer. Pitt cost-of—living
raises traditionally have been
based," on the previous year’s rise
in the Consumer Price Index.
For 1999, the CPI increase was
2.7 percent.

Market raises help to‘ retain"

personnel who might be re-
cruited by other employers. Eq-
uity adjustments address salary
compression and other situations
in which individuals’ salaries are

judged to be lower than merited. .

The University’s salary raise

._policy is performance-based,

meaning that no one whose work
is judged to be unsatisfactory is
supposed to get even a cost—of—
living raise. '

Increasing the compensation
base was needed to help make

‘the University more competi-

tive with respect to faculty sala-
ries, especially among Pitt’s fel-
low members of the Association
of American Universities (AAU),
Chancellor N ordenberg told the

tI“l.lStB€S .

"‘One of the most important

investments we can make is in
the peoplewhose workwill move

 

-us forward,” he said,

Duringthe ﬁscal year that
endedJune 30, the gaps between

Pittsburgh campus faculty sala-

ries and the AAU median ranged
from $3,600 for associate pro-
fessors to $5,800 for full profes-
sors. At Pitt’s regional campuses,
the gaps ranged from $600 for
Bradford campus assistant pro-
fessors to - $6,100 _ for associate
professors at Titusville.
Tuition and student fees
Tuition for full—time Penn-

sylvania residents in the College
ofArts and Sciences will increase
by $3 04 to $6,422 a year.‘Out—
of-state CAS studentsgwill pay

7 $14,104, or $670 more.
Full—time undergraduates-

pus (a $2 82 increase) to $18,026
for out-of-state students in the
schools of nursing and health
and rehabilitation sciences (up
by $85 8). 1..

Among Pitt graduate and first
professional programs, full—time
tuition for Pennsylvania resident
‘students will range from $8,754
in the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences and the schools of educa-
tion, social work, and public and
international affairs (an increase
of$416) to $22,420 in the medi-
cal school (up by $1,066).

Student fees will not increase
at the Pittsburgh campus, but
trustees approved hikes in fees at
the Greensburg,Johnstown and
Titusville campuses. ‘

called Pitt’s 5 percent tuition
increase “modest,” considering

the millions of dollars that Pitt

number of student applicants and
the academic credentials of Pitt
freshmen over the last ﬁve years
“provides continuing evidence
that we are recognized as an ex-

ary of each of the three years,
2000-2002. _ _ . .

The Pittsburgh campus cus-

In a vote last month, union
workers ratiﬁed the agreement.
The employees had been work-

since Dec. 31, when their con-

tract expired.

University spokesperson Ken
Service conﬁrmed the contract
details. “Members of local 585
are valued employees’ of the
University and we are pleased
that we reached what we feel is a
fair and equitable agreementwith
them,” Service said.

As part of the agreement, the

workers can choose from among

health beneﬁts options offered

by the UPMC Health Plan. Last
February, Pitt announced an ex-
clusive three—year deal with
UPMC Health Plan, which went
into effect July 1 .

and to say that we’re lucky to
have enjoyed his leadership. I

Dietrich, 62, has been a Pitt
trustee since 1991. He has served
on the board’s academic affairs/

Good, news,
bacl nevus

To the editor:

The front page story, “Chan-
cellor will consider group to
study same-sex benefits,” in the
University Times of June 22, is
good news and bad news.

1. The good news is the hon-
orable, responsible and gutsy
decision of Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg to consider the cre-
ation of a committee “to study
how Pitt might extend health
benefits to...same—sex partners.”
Honorable and responsible be-
cause such a move would not
only be the right thing to do, it
would also be consistent with
the way democratic institutions
address hot—button controver-
sies; and gutsy because the possi-
bility of creating such a commit-
tee will not make the chancellor’s
boss, the Board of Trustees, ex-
ult in paroxysms of joy. Atta boy,
Mark! I salute your inspired in-
tegrity and bold leadership.

2. The bad news is this oft-
repeated argument against same-
sex benefits: “Opposition to
same-sex benefits by some state
lawmakers who have threatened

to cut Pitt’s funding if it extends
health coverage to gay and les-
bian partners.” This argument
has been raised time and again
by Ken Service, director of Pitt’s
Office of News and Informa-
tion, and other University
spokespersons. 0

Does anyone in his or her.
right mind imagine that Harris-
burg would in effect shut down
the University, and with it the
education of thousands of stu-
dents (mostly Pennsylvanians),
not to mention community ser-
vices in medicine or otherwise, if
the University decided to.pro-
vide same-sex health benefits?
It just will never happen. Never.
Not ever.

Even if it were feared that the ,,

legislators would suicidally emas-
culate Pitt, were it to award same-
sex health benefits, I would hope
that our University would, un-
der the specter of this threat,
stand tall and battle vigorously,
bolstered by the moral principle
that treating homosexuals fairly
is, when all is said and ‘done, the
right thing to do. The right thing

berg has indeed expressed "his

Pitt trustee from February 1993
through December 1999. He

resigned upon taking office as

county executive on Jan. 1 to
avoid a possible conflict of inter-
est.

Four trustees left the Pitt

‘board because their terms ex-

pired: Paul Lego, Marvin Lieber,

a significant impediment to es-
tablishing the climate of open
and candid discussion that would
be a necessary element for the
success of any such effort.

2. Recognizing that Profes—.

sor Perloffs advice was well in-
tentioned, it nonetheless remains
true that it is easier for individu-
als who have no accountability
for the outcome to dismiss the
risks inherent in the course of
action that they advocate. Com-
monwealth officials have repeat-
edly stated that it would be con-
trary to state policy for state-
related universities to provide
same-sex health beneﬁts. Promi-
nent legislators have indicated
that to do so would jeopardize
state—related universities’ state
subsidies. And the Pennsylvania

House of Representatives is on

record as overwhelmingly sup-
porting a measure that would
have withheld state funds from
any ‘public university offering
these benefits. All of this has

been sufficiently convincing for

the leadership of Penn State to ~

publicly state it as the reason for
not acceding to requests for these
benefits. It has also apparently
been convincing to the members
of the Penn State campus com-

muni ,sincethe .have acce ted
Y P .

the decision without engaging
in ongoing criticism of their
university’s position. And
Temple, Lincoln and all of the
state-system universities have
refrained from providing these
beneﬁts. While Professor Perloff
may fervently believe the con-
trary, all of; the available evi-
dence clearly supports the view
that offering same-sex health

benefits would be a course of

action fraught with-‘ﬁnancial peril
for the University. I

ground through three of ' the
Cathedral).

Projects costing more than
$1 million are subject to review
and approval by the board’s prop-
erty and . facilities committee.

Of the total, state funds are
expected to account for $21.2
million. Another $13.8 million
will come from the budget of the
senior vice chancellor for Health
Sciences, $1 1 .4 million will come
out of Pitt educational and gen-
eral funds, $10.1 million will be
provided by gifts, and $2 million
will come out of auxiliary re-
serves.

Endowment .

Pitt’s endowment now totals

$1.02 billion, the first time it has
exceeded the billion—dollar mark.

That’s a 112 pe_rcent increase
since _ 1995, when the endow-
ment was $482 million, Chan-
cellor Nordenberg reported.
Last year alone, the endowment
grew by $150 million, he said.

Nordenberg attributed the.
growth to an 83 percent increase
in annual giving to Pitt since
1995, the bull market for stocks,
and a wise investment strategy.

Pitt’s invested wealth is
dwarfed by thatof the top ﬁve
endowed schools: .Harvard
($14.3 billion), the University of
Texas system ($8.1 billion), Yale
($7.2 billion), Princeton ($6.5
billion) and Stanford ($6 billion).
But regionally, Pitt’s endowment
exceeds those of Carnegie Mel-
lon ($870 million) and Penn State
($790.2 million). _

According to The Chronicle
of Higher Education, only 34
schools nationally had endow-
ments in excess of $1 billion as of
June 1999, although other uni-
versities (including Pitt) have
since joined that group.

Some 87 percent of Pitt’s
‘endowment is earmarked for spe-
ciﬁc purposes. Endowment in-
terest helps to fund scholarships,
equipment and some operating
expenses, Nordenberg said.

Fundraising
Private voluntary support has
increased by 83 percent since
1995, from $39.4 million to $72
million, the chancellor reported.
He announced that Bayer
Corp. will give Pitt $1.6 million

_ to endow two chairs. Most of the

grant will complete the endow-

,ment of the Bayer Chair in the

Department of Chemistry, held

by Dennis P. Curran. The rest

will endow the Development
Professorship in Chemical and
Petroleum Engineering, to be
held by Eric Beckman.
Clinical faculty

Tenure-stream faculty in the
medical school who have clinical
responsibilities now will be given
10 years, instead of the tradi-
tional seven years, to earn ten- .
ure, under a Pitt bylaws revision
approved by the trustees. -

Given the growing and un—“
predictable hospital workloads
of clinical faculty, a seven-year
probationary period for them is
no longer feasible, medical
school administrators have said.

An overwhelming majority of
voting faculty in the medical
school had endorsed the change,
as had’ F acultyAssembly and Sen-
ate Council.

claim the University discrimi-

is preparing and getting up to
date on things,” he told the Uni-
versity Times.

How did he react when the
Pitt board’s nominating commit-
tee" approached him about be-
coming chairperson-designate?

“Well, obviously, I agreed to
do it,” Dietrich replied, smiling.
“They had another candidate in
mind. That candidate didn’t
work out, so I was asked to do it,
and I’m pleased to do it.”

He declined to elaborate.
Board secretary Robert E.
Dunkelman said: “The nominat-
ing committee had two or three
unranked candidates in mind, any
one of whom would have been
qualified to fill the position. It’s
not that one was necessarily bet-
ter than another. But obviously,
you have to start somewhere in
determining whether candidates
are willing to assume the job,
and apparently the nominating
committee happened to ap-

7 proach another candidate be fore
they approached Mr. Dietrich.”

‘ Dietrich received his master’s

and Ph.D. degrees in political

science from Pitt in 1980 and
1984, respectively, and his un-

Babies and toddlers in St. Petersburg Baby Home #13 will be stud d by Pitt researchers.

Study of Russian orphanages may  

impact facilities there as well as 

child care centers internationally  

t first, Robert B.

McCall didn’t notice

I anything strange
about the way caregivers in a
Russian orphanage were feeding
their charges. Then he watched

a visiting mother feed her own

child.
The mother sat facing her

baby — talking to him, smiling, '

pausing to let him swallow be-
fore giving him another spoon-

ful. Caregivers, in contrast, sat,

side by side with children, quickly
and silently feeding them with a
utensil that resembled a small
shovel. There was no eye con-
tact, and much of the food ended
up on the children’s bibs. _

‘‘It’s not abusive, but it’s typi-
cal of the lack of social respon-
siveness you see in caregiving
behaviors over there,” said
McCall, who is co-director with
Christina]. Groark of Pitt’s Of-
fice of Child Development
(OCD).

Groark and McCall are lead-
ing an OCD project to improve
the social responsiveness and
stafﬁng patterns of caregivers at
Russian orphanages, and to study
the social, emotional, physical
and mental health of the infants
and toddlers in their care. 3

Research will focus on or-
phanages in St. Petersburg, Rus-
sia, where children up to 4 years
of age reside. About half of the
children have disabilities, rang-
ing from cerebral palsy to fetal
alcohol syndrome. ,

Funded by a" $2.8 million
grant from the National Insti-
tute of Child Health and Human
Development as well as grants
from the Howard Heinz Endow-
ment and the International As-
sistance Group, the project could
have wide—ranging implications
for child care internationally,
researchers say.

“Our hope,” Groark said, “is

that we can make improvements
in the Russian baby homes that
are sustainable and long-lasting,
but also that the‘méthods and
systems we develop can be ap-
plied to child care centers here
in the United States. Our Rus-
sian colleaguesare hoping that
they can adapt these. improve-
ments to .baby homes outside St.
Petersburg -and even in other
eastern European cities.”

American child care advo- __
cates wouldlove to get their.

hands on research results prov-
ing that children beneﬁt from

-better—trained, better-paid

caregivers, said McCall. “Right
now, there is no very good dem-
onstration of that, from the point

of view of well—documented re-

search,” he said. ’
That’s why the U.S. govern-
ment is funding a project that

will most immediately beneﬁt '

Russians, the OCD co-directors
said. “There is a humanitarian
aspect to it,” Groark noted, “but
our federal government also rec-
ognizes that, with welfare re-
form, it will have to put more
money into child care as more

‘parents go off to work and there’s

no one at home to take care of
the kids.”

VVhile the Russian system is
in some ways a throwback to the
America of 30 years ago, with an
emphasis on orphanages rather
than day care, conditions at the
St. Petersburg “baby homes” are
not so dissimilar from those”-at an
average U.S. child care center,
accordingto GroarkandMcCall.

Caregivers are mainly women

either in their early20s or middle,
aged, without college degrees.“

Payis low, the equivalent of $ 1 .20
an hour. Staff turnover is high.
But facilities are clean and un-
crowded.” V

“It’s not like the Romanian
orphanages that were uncovered

a decade or so ago, where things

were dismal in every respect,”

McCall said. “The kids in these
St. Petersburg baby homes are
well-fed. They get good medical
care. They have toys and equip-
ment — in some cases, they have
more F isher-Price stuff than the
average kid in an American sub-
urb. And ‘ they have roughly
enough caregivers. ' g *
“Everything is okay, except
that a kid who comes in before .4
months of age and who leaves
after 2 years will have had 60-
I 00 different caregivers, and it’s
unusual for a kid to see the same

.caregiver on two consecutive _

days. Also, the care tends to be
extremely perfunctory.” - -

Workers at Baby Home #13,
the main home to be studied,

seldom speak to their charges ‘

and respond to their behavior an
average of only 2.3 minutes over
a 3-hour period, the OCD
project has found. Babies sel-
dom ‘cry, and soon learn to con.-
form to rules. ‘ L 3

“If caregivers never respond
to you,you learn that there’s no
use in trying to interact with
them,” McCall said. “And how
do you learn to “develop relation-
ships when the cast of characters
is always changing?”

It’s not that Russian

,_ caregivers are unfeeling —— in-

deed, the opposite usually is true.
Groark ﬁbinted out. ’

3 “Many of the children in these
homes who are severely disabled
don’t relate back to the
caregivers, and some die.
Healthier “children are more
likely to be adop.ted by foreign-
ers, or they may go back to their
birth families. So, these women
don’t want to become too at-
tached to the children they work
with,” she said.

“We’re counseling the
caregivers about this. In training

sessions, we’ll talk to them about
the importance of emotional at-
tachments in the healthy devel-
opment of children, and how
these kids may come and go but
they do beneﬁt from social inter-
actionand seeing the same faces
over time.”

OCD staff are comparing
notes with American hospice
workers, who by deﬁnition work
with people about to die, “The

question is, can we translate what i

they’ve learned to a baby home
environment?” McCall said.
Some caregivers at Baby
Home #13 wondered aloud
whether providing an emotion-
ally supportive environment
might actually harm children
who move on to the next level of
orphanages, because conditions
in the latter generally are worse.
“Rather .than dismiss their
concern, ”McCall said, “we came
home and contacted three of the
world’s authorities on this. Then
we could go back and tell the

caregivers, ‘The preponderance

_ of evidence is thatolder children

are likely to fare better in a worse

A environment if they’ve experi-

enced a healthy environment at
a younger age.”’

Since 1996, Groark and
McCall have been going to St.
Petersburg once or twice a year,
staying for weeks at a time. “Bob
and I aren’t seen as visitors any-
more,” Groark said. “VVhen_we
go over there, we buy our food in
their markets, we‘negotiate their
public transportation —-— or lack
of it — and we live in apartments
that are within walking distance
of the baby home, just as the
caregivers do..VVe had to be able

to witness eve‘ry"thjng;‘to"be there”'

at the center during all of the
shifts to observe stafﬁng patterns
and details of the ways care is
provided.” .

McCall, Groark and their
Russian co-researchers drew up
charts detailing stafﬁng assign-
ments and where children were
located according to ages and
disabilities. Under the system
they are developing, pairs of
caregivers will work with the
same groups of children every
week. ‘ ~ _

OCD_will instruct teams of
Russian “trainers,” who in turn

-will teach caregivers practices

recommended by America’s

Council for Exceptional Chil-
dren and the National Associa-
tion for Young Children. Re-
searchers will view videotapes of
interaction between caregivers
and babies, and of staff supervi-
sion.

Development of infants in

3 Baby Home #13 will be moni-

tored and compared with that of
children in other homes.

‘Adopted children will be fol-

lowed up and compared to chil-
dren adopted from the same or-
phanage before the intervention,
and those adopted from other
baby homes.‘ Other comparisons
will be made with foreign—born
children adopted by families in
Minnesota and American par-
ent—reared childrenin Connecti-
cut. . V

_ “We'll start the intervention
this fall,” McCall said. “We have
every reason to believe that the
[Russian] children will show
some benefits fairly quickly. The
question is, how long willithose

beneﬁts last? And, how early do '

changes have to be made? Stud-

, ies in Romania indicate that kids

who are adopted [by foreign par-
ents] before they’ve been in an

orphanage for six months have '

no more problems than children
in their adoptive country. How-
ever, kids who spend more than

six months in those orphanage-se

do have increased problems.
They may have difﬁculty in mak-
ing friends or they may be indis-
criniinately friendly. They may
be exceedingly shy or very ag-

gressive.”

OCD researchers are cau-
tioning Baby Home #13 staff to
expect disruptive side effects

Currently, the Russian infants
and toddlers do what they’re told.
“When itfs nap time, whether
they re -sleepingjor not, they lay
there and they’re quiet. How
often does that happen in an

' American home, never mind in

an American child care center?”
Groark asked, laughing. “We’ve
warned our Russiancolleagues
that when you begin encourag-
ing these children to.be creative
and independent, the staff will
probably pay a price. It may not
be possibleianymore for one adult

to easily supervise eight ‘babies A

and toddlers.”

2 groups of cancer specialists to merge  

Two groups of area cancer
specialists are joining forces.

Oncology HematologyAsso—
ciates (OHA), a specialty prac-
tice of 30 oncologists working in
21 locations throughout the tri-
state area, intends to join the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute (UPCI), the area’s only
National Cancer Institute
(NCI)-designated Comprehen-
sive Cancer Center. A

UPCI has 27 faculty mem-
bers at Pitt’s School of Medicine
and 18 community physicians
who are medical oncologists.
Through this association, UPCI
will have more medical
oncologists than any other U.S.
cancer center.

Under the proposed agree-

current research endeavors as
well as participate inthe clinical
research projects of UPCI.

Arthur Levine, senior vice
chancellor for Health Sciences
and dean of Pitt’s School» of
Medicine, said, “UPCI is inter-
nationally recognized forits can-
cer research and' is among the
top 12 cancer centers nationally
with respect to research funding
from the NCI. For UPCI, the
importance of a strong network
of community physicians cannot
be overestimated. This compo-
nent is necessary for clinical re-
search to ﬂourish and to insure
that_the largest number of pa-
tients has access to new treat-
ments as soon as they become
available.” .

a director for medical oncology‘

president of OHA, will assume
the additional position of deputy

for UPCI.

In addition to the physicians, ’

OHA employs 260 staff mem-
bers. OHA currently is managed
by US Oncology Network
(USON) a national‘ for—proﬁt

oncology management com-

pany. UPCI is negotiating with

USON to provide management
services to UPCI’s community
specialty practices and explore
the development of regional can— ‘
cer centers. "
Based on last year’s statistics,

“the combination of these two

programs will mean that its 75
cancer specialists will see more
than 20,800 new patients each

ment, OHA would continue its Stanley Marks,. founder and year. . I

The University of Pittsburgh is an Aﬂirmative Action,
Equal Opportunity Employer

  JULY 6', 2000

Group urges measures to

control skyr

of scholarly publishing P  

greeing that “the cur-
rent system of schol-
' arly publishing has

become too costly for the aca-
demic community to sustain,” a
group of ‘university administra-
tors, librarians, publishers and
association leaders has issued a
set of principles intended to guide
the transformation of scholarly
publishing. .

Among the document’s 36”

signatories were Pitt Provost
James V. ‘Maher and Rush G.
Miller, ‘director of Pitt’s Univer-
sity Library System.
' The agreement, coordinated
by the Association of American
Universities (AAU) and the As-
sociation of Research Libraries
(ARL), calls on universities, pub-
lishers and faculty members to:
° Contain and even reduce
costs while giving scholars ac-
cess to needed information — by
using technology to streamline
publishing functions, for ex-

ample, and by purchasing elec-

tronic resources through library
consortia.

° Use electronic publishing
to provide wide access to schol-
arship, encourage interdiscipli-
nary research and enhance
searchability.

° Securely archive scholarly
publications.

° Continue to include pro-
cesses for evaluating the quality
of scholarly work, and provide
readers with information about
evaluation thework has under-
gone.

° Manage copyright, in the
digital age, in a way that assures
faculty access to, and use of, their
own published works. -

‘Negotiate publishing agree-
ments that promote ready access
to faculty members’ work. Fac-

' ulty are urged to choose journals

that make scholarly work avail-
able at reasonable cost.

° Speed up the time it takes
submitted articles to be pub-
lished. ‘

° Emphasize quality over
quantity of publications in evalu-
ating afaculty member’s work.

°_Assure privacy to scholars
and students in using digital as
well as print materials.

The document, “Principles

V ,for—Emerging Systems of Schol-

ocketing cost

arly Publishing,” notes that in-
creasing volume and costs of
scholarlypublications—particu-
larly in science, technology and
medicine — are making it im-
possible for libraries to meet the

8 research needs of faculty and stu-

dents.

Moreover, the pressure on-

library budgets from hi gh—priced

science, technology and medical

. publications has made it difficult V

for academic publishers in the
humanities and social sciences
to publish monographs or to find
the money to invest in migrating
to digital publishing systems,
according to the AAU/ARL
document.

“Numerous studies, confer-
ences and roundtable discussions
over the past decade have ana-
lyzed the underlying causes and
recommended solutions to the
scholarly publishing crisis,” the
document states. “Many new
publishing models have
emerged. A lack of consensus

, and concerted action by the aca-

demic community, however,
continues to allow the escalation
of prices and volume.” A

The AAU has urged creation
of campus forums to discuss the
scholarly publishing crisis. Pro-
vost Maher said he is consider-
ing holding such a forum at Pitt.

Maher emphasized that the
AAU/ARL principles represent
a starting point. “This is the
opening of a discussion that will
goon among the faculties of all
the major universities during the
next couple of years as they dis-
cuss‘ ways to make their pub-
lishe_d work accessible to their
colleagues, accessible to them-
selves when they want to use it,
and yet to be published in pres-
tigious journals,” he said. V

Tenure and promotion com-
mittees at Pitt focus on the sub-
stance of published research
rather than on the sheer number
of publications, according to
Maher. “But there is a general
perception that, at least at some
universities, there’s a tendency
to count papers,” he said.

The AAU/ARL agreement,
published" this summer, grew out

of a by—invitation conference in .

Tempe, Ariz. last spring.

UPB starts program for
students in high school

High school students can now
take advantage of academic op-
portunities at »Pitt’s Bradford
campus ugcller a nevyl program
announce ast mont . ‘

“Our new Bridges Program
gives local high school students
the chance to enroll in classes at
Pitt-Bradford and earn up to six
college credits each semester,”
said Alex Nazemetz, director of
admissions at UPB.

To enroll, high school se-
niors _ or second—sernester jun-
tors must be enrolled in a college
preparatory curriculum, be in the
top 50 percent of their class and

be recommended by their guid-

. ance counselor or principal.

“Students who take" advan-
tage of this program also qualify
for a discounted tuition rate,”
Nazemetz says. “Obviously, if
those students graduate from
high school and enroll at Pitt-
Bradford, the classes they’ve suc-
cessfully completed in the
Bridges Program will count to-
ward their graduation require-
ments. But even if they decide to
enroll at a different college, our
credits are easily transferable.”
