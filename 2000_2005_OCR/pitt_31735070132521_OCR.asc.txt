VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 23

Politicians propose
“do not spam” list

MARIAI-I MOORE KHANNA
I Staff Writer

You’ve got — way too much
—— mail. And when ‘the messages
come to your e—mail account, with
rapid abandon, from unknown or
unwanted sources, they’re called
“spam.”

Though e—mail spam has noth-
ing to do with the Hormel canned
food, it has everything to do with
the first amendment, the loss of

billions of dollars and, pe_rhaps,_

the endof e—mail itself.

From college students to
politicians, most everyonefwith
an e—mail account is affected’ by
spam. E—mail spam has united the
political right and left, to the
point where there are nearly a

‘spam

dozen bills waiting to be passed

that would curtail this problem.

The large number of unsolicit-
ed e—mails received this year by
businesses could end up costing
$10 billion, according to CBS.

Aside from the economic
problem, created when a busi-
ness’s e—mail ‘quota is filled by
spam and thus becomes disabled,
there is the moral agenda behind

the political crackdown on spam. ‘

Children are the concern.

Forty—seven ‘percent of all
contains pornographic
material, and 21 percent of chil-
dren with e—mail access have been
exposed to the pornographic
images found in spam, according

Pitt students,‘faculty and staff
members fill Oakland in the morn-
ing, waiting for buses or shuttles,
searching for parking spaces or
trudging to class on foot.

There’s not a “whoosh” in
Oakland. r I

But at one university i11
Southwestern , Pennsylvania,
school officials hope students will
be able to hop on a convenient,
elevated, magnetically propelled
train system. With frequently
scheduled stops, the system would
let students commute from one
end of campus to the other in a
couple of minutes.

rUnfortunately for. Pitt stu--

dents, this system is going up at

Pennsylvania, and.not at Pitt —at
least, not yet.

Urban Maglev is a train—like
system, where cars ride in near
silence, inches above a raised
guideway, or track. Cars travel on
waves of magnetic energy.

Unlike its faster (300 »MPH),
heavier (120 tons), and much more
expensive technological cousin
High-Speed Maglev, which was
created in Germany in the 1980s.
Urban Maglev technology was

conceived and built entirely in the

Spam bill may take long tim

Spam, page 1

to a report and recent survey by Symantec, an
anti—virus software company.

A recent anti-spam bill, supported by Sen.
Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Charles
Schumer, D—N.Y., would create a national “do not
spam” list that would work much like the national
“do not call” list that was passed last year.

Offenders violating the spam list could face

jail time and fines of up to $5,000, with harsher I

penalties for those who send pornography to
minors.

When will a bill on spam be passed? ' _

“Probably. not anytime soon,” according to
Prof. George H. Pike, who specializes in Internet
Law and Resources at Pitt.-

‘‘Free speech is at the heart of the issue,” Pike
said, explaining that any regulation concerning the
first amendment, which addresses free speech,
“takes time.”

No laws regulating spam currently exist.

For now, individuals and institutions must take
it upon themselves to regulate spam. E—mail filters
are an option for account users, though they are
notoriously imperfect.

Pitt has not yet applied an enterprise-wide fil-
tering system to its e-mail service Mulberry.

Most students do not know,,however, that they
can do so for free by. obtaining a “student tool
kit.” The kits are available at every campus—com—
puting lab and contain a compact disc that enables
filtering under the heading “e-mail client,”-
according to Jinx Walton, director of computing

services.

Walton said she sees e-mail spam as “an
annoyance,” but she believes people know to just
delete the unwanted messages they’re receiving.

This was probably not a good solution for the
Pitt professor who was receiving 16 e-mails an
houn

Geoff Bonina, the Web mas-
ter, for the English Writing
department, described the pro-
fessor’s situation.

Students who have called the
computing services help line
might have been told to “install
SpamCop at a cost of $9.99 a
month.” This is inaccurate infor-
mation, according to Walton, T
who said the SpamCop program does not cost any-
thing. Instead, it’s a service to which people can
report obscene or persistent e-mails.

SpamCop’s Web site does offer filtered e-mail
accounts — for $30 a year.

Mass marketing — and the money it generates
—- may also be a force behind spam. Osterman
Research, which publishes articles criticizing
spam laws, pointed out that it helps “organizations

Michael Osterman, who wrote the article, /

“The SPAM Act: it’s the new V-Chip,” said “l0
minutes of online searching and $29.95 (or less)

can buy you any of several very good c1ient—side»

spam filters that are easy to install and very effec-
tive at stopping spam.”

Whether you’re I looking at
Osterman Research advertising or
SpamCop, it is important to realize
that they are both businesses that

said Bonina, who filters’ com- . businesses, they essentially want your

Bonina said he did not know €'mall. . Schumef reported that his research’

user, if the rate of growth continues as
it has in the past several years. E—mail
users received an average of 40 spam
messages in 1999; the average total
\ should surpass 2,500 this year.

A new digital copyright act, in addition. to one
passed in 1998, may be necessary to regulate spam
on a federal level if the anti-spam bills pass, Pike
said. As he discussed the intricacies of such an
amendment, several pieces of mail appeared on
his screen in Russian, a language he does not
speak.

“This is spam,” Pike said.

optimum for short urban distances.
The other goes 300 miles per hour
and is meant for much longer dis-
tances.”

U.S. Congressman, and Pitt
Alumnus, Jack Murtha, D-12th dis-
trict, has championed Southwestern
Pennsylvania’s involvement with
Urban Maglev. 1

Murtha’ led the political effort to
secure _federal funding for local
Urban Maglev development and
construction, recently submitting a
request for $5 million from next
year’s budget to use toward com-
pleting the $188 million dollar
California University demonstration
system. Murtha said Urban Maglev
would aid transportation and ‘help
the local economy by easing com-
mutes and creating 300 to 400 high-
paying manufacturing jobs building
Maglev parts. . '

General Atomics, in San Diego,
Calif., created the modified system,
which would be constructed through
a joint venture by a number of local
companies, . including Hall
Industries“Inc., in Butler County,

Union Switch & Signal Inc;, PJ '

Dick Inc.
Company.
Supporters of the technology are

and Sargent Electric

counting on a few other financial ’

advantagesto sell it to cities like
Pittsburgh. Operating the system
entirely above city streets, on a
raised track, would sidestep expen-
sive insurance costs ,that light rail
systems, traveling at the same level
as city street traffic, have to pay,

since the elevated track lowers the

risk of hitting pedestrians.

Light rail and other current train T

technologies produce a lot of sound
and air pollution, and because of
federal environmental regulations
pertaining to noise abatement and

safety issues, at least half the train,

routes often must be built under-
ground. W

Building -and extending these
systems becomes extremely expen-
sive —— tunneling costs as much as
three times the amount as building
at street level, or grade. Urban
Maglev, which is completely above
grade, would not bring such high
costs. ,

Proponents of the system also
argue that Urban Maglev could pay
for itself. with low operating costs.
They believe it wouldcomplement,
not compete with, existing city bus
routes by relieving congestion with-
out taking tax dollars away from the
already strained bus budget.

Led by local developer U.S.
Maglev Development Corp., whose

vice-president is former

Maglev group of com-
panies are making their
way through a long-
term, four—stage plan

Getting the system ‘at

and running would com-
plete the third stage-—
demonstration. With the
challenging incline
grades and inclement
weather of the
Southwestern
Pennsylvania region,
Urban Maglev propo-
nents hope not only to
demonstrate the physi-

cal capabilities of the technology,
but also to show the positive socio-
economic effects of the system on
local residents, urban planners and
possible worldwide applicants.

“It’s a two-for-one deal,”
O’Loughlin said. “We get to demon-
strate the technology, and help an
up-and—coming university solve its
transportation and safety problems.”

,If the Urban Maglev trial is suc-
cessful, future Pitt students might be
able to take a ride on a system like it
from one end of Oakland to the
other — and make that class on time
after all.

A EDITORIAL

Wrongheaded attempt at curbing rising tuition A

On Sept. 4, two Republican repre-
sentatives published a report criticiz-

A ing rising tuition at American colleges

and universities.

The two, John A. Boehner, R-
Ohio, and Howard D. McKeon, R-
Calif., are proposing a bill to address
skyrocketing tuition rates at many
public and private schools nationwide.

The conditions of the proposed bill
state that if tuition grows ‘at more than

twice the rate of the Consumer Price

Index —— a figure, put forth by the fed-
eral government, denoting the cost of a
“market basket” of goods and services
purchased by the average American -
over three consecutive years, the insti-
tution in question must bring about a
plan for curbing costs.

The school then has two to three
years to implement the plan. If, after
this period, tuition is still growing too
fast, federal sanctions will be imposed.

To any college student -—— or col—'
lege student’s parents —~ this sounds
like a great way for the federal govem-
ment to step in and keep costs under
control. The report even states,
“decades of uncontrolled cost increas-
es are pushing the dream of a college
degree further out of reach for needy
students.”

Sounds like Reps. Boehner and
McKeon are really looking out for the
students’ bottom lines, right?

It does, until the sanctions them-

selves are considered.

A school that can’t get its tuition
under control would face, according to
the proposed bill, the loss of some fed-
eral student aid programs.

In other words, if tuition at dear ol’ .
State U. gets ridiculous, students will
. have less help paying it. ‘

’ This will help students to achieve
the dream of a college degree, how? _
There must be another way. The
goal of the proposed bill is admirable
— it’s just the means of carrying it out
that stink. '

Any financial sanction imposed on
a college \or university is ultimately
going to hurt students. Whatever mon-
etary penalties ‘ are imposed will be
compensated at the students’ expense,
either in‘, terms of further increased
tuition or a compromise in the quality
of education.

Instead of hurting those who the
bill claims to be aiding, why not
impose sanctions that no sane univer-
sity will be able to ignore?

Consider threatening schools with
a loss of accreditation. Without it, no
school can stay in business. Or the fed-
eral government could create a new
category and bestow upon or withhold
a title or particular standing from
schools, based on their tuition—raising
record.

Give the proposed bill some teeth
— just don’t bite students with them.

Asking me if your girlfriend’s nick-

homophobe, it just makes you an idiot. Gay
men don’t have girlfriends, sweetie.

Monogamy is sweet and rewarding —

for emotionally mature people who trust and

respect one another._ It’s also complicated
and can be taxing. It’s a decision two people
must make and a promise they keep. It’s
comfortable and allows for personal growth
for both members in said relationship.

Pint-sized whores think adults with Chipmunks tapes are weird

Some days my brain wants to feel sexy, like a
hot blob of gray matter just itching to try on some
new shoes and totally redecorate the apartment until
it screams “Fabulous!” It’s a weird feeling, but I
never argue with my brain. Suddenly, I find myself
reading the New York Times Fashion section, won-
dering why I wasn’t also drinking a cappuccino and
munching a bran muffin.

Two articles in the aforemen-
tioned section caught my attention.
The first was about the perennial
clash between mothers and daughters
over how much skin the youngsters
should be allowed to show. There’s
nothing really new about that, but
with the continuing popularity of teen
divas whose talent is measured by
cup size, that special age when a girl
buys her first thong is getting
younger. Not to make a broad gener— .
alization, but according to the New York Times, all
pre—teen girls these days want to look like whores.
Pint-sized whores. Interesting.

The second article, titled “I Don’t Want To
Grow Up,” chronicled the plight of upper-middle
class adults trying to reclaim their youth by buying
toys. Not. grown-up toys like SUVs or IRAs, but
actual children’s toys like Strawberry Shortcake
dolls and —— wait for it — a Honda—brand toy truck
marketed to extreme sports enthusiasts.

The article really made me feel for those young
urban professionals with plenty of money to spend
on reissued Care Bears. Then I grabbed my dictio-
nary, searching for the definition of “emotionally
retarded.” There it was: “buying dolls at age 35.’.’

  

Jesse Hicks
Columnist

There’s something vaguely disturbing about an
adult who finds the Chipmunks — those helium-
sucking rodents whose albums of novelty songs
were a kitsch hit when I was, like, 12 — “funny,
period.” The really mean part of me wants to say,
“You’re going to die alone, period.”- ‘

Incidentally, the children are with me on this
one. Said one consumer,.“I’ll be playing a
Chipmunk record in my car and, if a kid
hears’ it, they get seriously weirded out.”
Yes. Though, if you really want to weird
them out, maybe you should be driving a
dark—colored van with tinted windows. Then
park by a schoolyard and play your record.
You’ll get some attention.

Like me, you’re probably thinking,
“Where’s this going? What’s the connection
between dirty whorechildren and thir-
tysomethings who live in their parents’
basements, playing with GI Joes‘?’’ There’s
one obvious connection, but that’s a felony and it’s
sick that you would even think it. C _

No, the real connection is simple: marketing.
Both articles mention the marketing aspects of these
trends, with their accompanying and annoying neol-
ogisms. For the young girls, it’s “K.G.O.Y” — an
acronym for Kids Getting Older Younger, both in
their sexual expression and, more importantly, in
their purchasing habits. The oldsters who love toys
are “kidults” or “adultolescents” who need to soothe
their inner four—year—old with dollies and sing-along
albums.

Marketers know that both afﬂuent teens and dis-
illusioned Gen-Xers have mounds of disposable
income. And the golden rule of marketing is that any

 

insecurity can be healed with a MasterCard. The
hipsters try to recapture the freedom and fun of
childhood by buying its trappings,»while teens try to
attain sexual maturity by emulating its most garish
examples. And no matter what your fetish, be it lim-
ited-edition Masters of the Universe figures or that
Britney Spears postage-stamp bikini, there will
always be someone there to sell you a dream.
There is probably a serious point to be made
here, about the confusion of material goods with the
feelings they are supposed to provoke. Did you ever,
as a kid, play with toys because you wanted to feel
like a kid? So why, at 30, would a toy be symbolic
of your eternal youth? And isn’t there something
fairly shallow about an entire culture that wants to
be 16 forever? Maybe not, as long as it’s a sexy 16.
— You could probably make those fairly depress-
ing points about l3—year—olds who want to look 27
and 27-year-olds who want to feel 13. But I’m an
optimist, and I’d rather think that fashion — and
marketing — is pushing us toward a one-age-fits-all
future. Maybe if we all close our eyes and open our
wallets, we can be whisked away to a future of deli-
ciously hypersexualized grotesquerie: Everyone
will be the thong—snapping 16-year-old boy playing
with his action figures, or sexpot girl gossiping on
her cell phone and applying gratuitous7amounts of
blue eyeliner. It will be a land free of boring jobs
and student loans, cleansed of responsibility and
grocery’ store runs. All our anxieties will melt away,
the pressures and fears of adulthood buried in the
sandbox, and our hearts will worry only about
matching accessories and the possibility of cooties.

Wine and cheese and a new basis forintercultural comparision

Spending nine months in anoth-
er country does .a lot to change
one’s outlook. Particularly if it hap-
pens to be the same country many
Americans love to hate.

Yes, folks, we’re talking about
France, where I holed up to weather
the coming international storm,
concocted lovingly by W., brewed
from a recipe of certain American
foreign policies.

I went to school, consumed vast
amounts of wine and cheese, and

continued to lead'my otherwise.

uninteresting life in Grenoble, nes-
tled among the French Alps.

Leaving one’s country of origin
is, inherently, an experience that
changes one’s perception of all
things social and cultural.

Contrary to popular belief, the
norms of ‘American society are not
necessarily embraced or exercised
worldwide. '

For those strong enough to
adjust to — and absorb —— a new
culture, a part of their very identity
changes as they critically reappraise
aspects of their own way of life.

When I realized that I had stum-
bledlinto a country whose greatest

writers are revered as much.a_s our
current professional sports stars, I
felt an immediate affinity bud for
that culture.

On a similar note, having sam— ‘
pled French cuisine, I discovered
that ranch dressing is an utterly
tasteless condiment.

What people _tend to underesti-
mate is how this change in percep-
tion affects the road—weary traveler
returning home.

After the immediate joy of see-
ing friends and family, and tasting
with relish all the snack products
you’ve so missed, a handful of nig-

gling questions start to invade your

otherwise pleasant homecoming.

For me, the questions boiled
down to this: America, did I change,
or did you?

The answer is, most decidedly,
both.

A large number of such ques-
tions as, “Were Americans always
so willfully stupid?” or observa-
tions like, “Gosh, there sure are a
lot of fat people wandering
around,” can be chalked up to an
increased sensitivity to such things
on my part, having now acquired a

basis of comparison.
However, American culture has

unquestionably changed within the

past few years.

After all, how else could this
country, which decried a former
president for lying about having
sexual relations with a certain
intern, blithely
ignore the lies
and propaganda
used by our cur-
rent president to
rationalize a
war?

Undoubtedly,
there are many
aspects of
American culture
that will always
be a part of my identity, not the
least of which are my indelible mar-
riage to 24-hour instant gratifica-
tion and my unconscionable love of
American metal artists such as
Slayer.

Now, though, I ‘regard our
nation through a lens tinted by the
knowledge that, across the Atlantic,
there exist people whose culture is
as tangibleto them as ours is to us.

J .P. Fridy

Columnist

 

At the same time, while I was
abroad, Americans’ perception of
themselves —— and the role of their

nation in the world — has altered. I

So I find myself home, but also in a
country slightly foreign.

In addition, I sometimes find’

myself in the midst of a conversa-
tion regarding the evils of France
and the virtue of Freedom Fries.

So, both America and I have
changed in profound ways within
the past year. And I am constant-_
ly challenged when sorting out
Why I notice certain things more
now than I did a year ago.

emotional responses to those

things that have always bothered

me about American society have
shifted from mild irritation to
almost visceral rage.

' Things like crappy R&B, FOX
News, Ann Coulter books, anti-
intellectualism and athletic scholar-_
ships now send me into apoplectic
fits where growling and muttering
used to suffice. '

hat’s the deal with

Pitt’s mysterious undergroundtunnels?

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Editor in Chief

There is a tunnel that goes from Trees
Hall to the Fieldhouse (downstairs, by
the racquetball courts, in Trees —— it
goes under Aliquippa Street, and you
come out near the locker rooms in the
Fieldhouse).

Rumor has it that underground tunnels
connect many of the buildings on cam-
pus. Is this true? ‘

This is a great question for two rea-
sons: One, it’s a rumor that is thrown

around constantly and believed by many.

people and, two, it gives me a reason to
include the Druids in this column again.
In a word: yes. There are tunnels,
according to Laura Zullo, Pitt’s manager
of equipment preservations for Facilities
Management. Lots of tunnels, actually,
under lots of buildings. _
They’re steam tunnels, part of Pitt’s
heating system, and most of them are
under streets or sidewalks. And they’re not
new.
“Many of them have been in place for
lots of years,” Zullo said, adding that new
ones are constructed every now and then.
See, pipes in tunnels last longer than
pipes just buried in the ground because
there’s less moisture to eat away at that

oh—so—fragi1e metal. Most of the tunnels
connect steam vaults outside of Pitt build-
ings, as opposed to connecting the build-
ings themselves;

But are they used for transportation,
you ask. Are there Druids under my ﬂoor
right now, clad in black and wandering
through steam tunnels with swords
drawn? Is my favorite student leader
walking to herfavorite tree without ever
needing to see the light of day?

You can_walk in thetunnels, but you
probably wouldn’t want to, according to

Zullo, who’s been in the tunnels. They’re *

apparently dark, a little cramped and on
the warm, damp side. ~

' ‘They’re not a lot of fun to be in,” she
said.

, Which means that either the Druids
just walk around like normal people, trav-
el in relative discomfort, or — wait for it
— Zullo is a Druid and this is a cover-up.

The tunnel under Trees is not one of
these steam tunnels, but one of Pitt’s few

pedestrian ones. Zullo said’ she didn’t.

know of any others speciﬁcally, but Liz
Culliton, president of Student
Government Board, said she had been in
tunnels under the quad‘ that are used for
deliveries. They’re also used for Resident
Student Association’s armual Nightmare

, “The Magdalene Sisters” is a

A drama, based on actual accounts,

I that tells the haunting story of four

girls and their experiences in the
Magdalene asylums of Ireland.

The Magdalene asylums —

named after Mary Magdalene, the

COURTESY MIRAMAX PICTURES

er of Christ — were set up by the
Catholic Church as aplaoe to reform
“fallen” girls. Governed by nuns,
these institutions were nothing more
than laundry housesthat worked the
girls beyond physical exhaustion,
which was considered an “earthly
means to cleanse the so .”

The ﬁlm follows Margaret
(Anne-Marie Duffy), Bernadette
(Nora-Jane Noone), Rose (Dorothy
Duffy) and Crispina (Eileen Walsh)
as they work in silence and misery.

As we soon ﬁnd out, these
dredges of society are nothing more
than scared girls who have been put
in the asylums by their families and
their faith. I

she was raped, others are unwed
mothers and another still is there
because she was deemed a potential
temptress of boys. Set in 1964 —
when the wornen’s liberation move-
ment was growing in America -
this ﬁlm shows how girls were being
cut off from society, and verbally
and physically abused, in Ireland.
With the Catholic Church com-
ing under worldwide scrutiny for the
behavior of its priests, this ﬁlm can
easily be seen as another unmasking
of the injustices of Catholicism. It
questions the blind faith that these
people have in their spiritual leaders.

Subterranean mysteries

Timnels, page 10

Now, a skeptical person might read
this and think that a prominent student
leader informed about secret tunnels
can only mean one thing.

“I have never been in a Druid tun-
nel,” Culliton said, adding that such a
statement did not imply the existence of
such tunnels. The plot thickens.

There ‘are maps of these tunnels,
but they’re not public information, for
security reasons. Apparently, if one i
were so inclined, a person could use the
tunnels for secret access and then steal
or sabotage our steam vaults. Zullo did

give me“ some speciﬁc examples of
buildings that are connected by tunnels,
but then said that if I printed those, it
would be a security risk and she’d have
to kill me. ' 0

Okay, -I sort of inferred that last
part,but she sounded dangerous on the

phone. And, if she is one of the Druids, ‘

she probably has some serious connec-
tions.

So, yes, there are tunnels under’

Pitt’s campus. But to get in them, you
either need to work "for Facilities
Management, be a criminal master-
mind, or join a secret society. And that
last option’s not a sure thing.

MEGHAN MILLER/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

Larry Fitzgerald makes one of his three touchdown catches in the second quarter of Saturday’s game against Kent State.
The Panthers scored 43 unanswered points and improved to 7-0 all-time against the Golden Flashes. 3

~ DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Contributing Editor V

Only ten seconds into Pitt’s ﬁrst

A driveof the second quarter, the ques-

tion of quarterback Rod Rutherford’s
_mental readiness for the Panther’s
opener against , Kent State was
answered. 3 .

After sitting out the first quarter, a
team punishment for his off—field

transgressions, Rutherford, on his first ,

pass, connected with Princell

- Brockenbrough for a 20-yard touch-

down strike.

That began an offensive onslaught .

resulting in Rutherford completing 17
of 25 passes for 288 yards and four
touchdowns. The Panthers scored 43
unanswered points in a lopsided, 43-3
victory. S

“That was a real good win for us,”
head coach Walt Harris said. “I’m
really excited for our football team to

V be able to have won this game fairly

convincingly.”
The Panthers started slowly in
both offense and defense. On the first

drive of the game, Kent State moved

the ball easily up the field.

Quarterback Joshua Cribbs completed-

ﬁve of six passes for 45 yards and
rushed for 25 yards. '

But a Kent State false start penal-
ty at the Pitt 5-yard line,- and a 12-yard
sack delivered by Tyrone Gillard on
the next play, forced Kent to settle for
a field goal, the only points the
Golden Flashes would score in the
game.

“I think we were a little tired on
that first drive. I think some of our
players were in position to make plays
and they didn’t, make them,” Harris
said.

On Pitt’s first drive of the game,
the Panthers rushed the ball six times
for 39 yards with no pass attempts
from starting quarterback Luke Getsy.
The drive ended in a 37-yard punt by
Andy Lee.

Pitt’s‘ second possession of the
first quarter was more of the same.
After Bernard Lay’s interception, the
first of his career, Pitt rushed the ball
twice and Getsy threw two incomplete
passes, resulting in another punt, a 54-
yard blast off the foot of Lee.

Pitt’s third possession wasn’t

PittsnuffsoutFlashes,43-3

much different. The Panthers rushed
the ball once for two yards and Getsy
threw two incompletions to wide
receiver "Larry Fitzgerald, who
dropped both passes, forcing a third
punt,‘ a 52-yard, kick, from Lee.

“Because Larry has such great
hands, it was a little surprising [that he
dropped the two passes thrown to
him],” Getsy said. “But that’s just the
way it goes sometimes. You just got to
keep playing through it.”

“Not to say Luke 'did anything
wrong, or he didn’t make any-wrong
reads or anything like that. It’s just
that I’ve been accustomed to Catching
balls from Rod and doing everything
with Rod,” Fitzgerald said.

. Atthe start of the second quarter,
when Rutherford entered the game,
the comfort Fitzgerald -— as well as
the Pitt offense feels with
Rutherford was apparent.

After Pitt’s quick first touchdown
drive, Rutherford connected with
Fitzgerald six, times —— three of them
for touchdown —- including a 54-yard
reception in the second quarter, which

Kent State, page 17

Harris quiet
about QB ’s

  punishment

 

On his first pass attempt of
Saturday’s game, Rod Rutherford
found Princell Brockenbrough for a

20-yard touchdown.

On the next four Pitt possessions,
Rutherford drove Pitt down inside the
Kent State ﬁve-yard line. Three of
those possessions ended in touch-
downs, with only Brandon Miree’s
fumble keeping the Panthers from a
fourth. ‘ A

In less than two quarters,
Rutherford completed 17 of his 25

passes, for 288 yards and four touch-

downs. When he entered the game on
Pitt’s ﬁrst possession of the second
quarter, the Panthers trailed 3-0. When
he left with 1:25 to go in the third, Pitt

was ahead, 35-3.

So much for off—ﬁeld distractions.

As you probably already know,
Rutherford was charged with two mis-
demeanors — simple assault and inde-
cent assault — and summary criminal
mischief on Friday, stemming from an
incident that occurred early last
Monday morning, in the parking lot
behind Philthy McNasty’s.

As you also probably already
know, Pitt head coach Walt Harris
“punished” Rutherford by not starting
the senior quarterback against Kent
State. Harris presumably decided to
punish Rutherford because he broke a
team rule, although he won’t say
which one.

While the decision. to sit
Rutherford came before any legal
decision had been made, Harris knew
that his quarterback faced criminal
charges before he sent him onto the
field on Saturday.

With that in mind, should
Rutherford’s off—field incident have
kept him off the field?

Women’s cross country finishes first in season opener

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

The Pitt cross country teams
began their season on Saturday,
competing in the Duquesne Duals
Invitational.

The women’s team defeated nine
opposing »teams, including No. 30-
ranked West Virginia University,
while the men finished 5-3.

Pitt managed to get its first four
runners in the top 10 in the women’s
5-kilometer, a race in which close to
100 athletes competed.

Junior Maureen McCandless fin

ished first for the Panthers, and sec-
ond overall, with a timeof 17 min-
utes, 46 seconds. She improved her
time 46 seconds since the same invi-
tational last year.

McCandless held her spot
through the final straightaway, amid
the screams of supporters from the
Pitt track team _and coaches alike.

“Lets go Mo, come Lon Mo!”
head coach Alonzo Webb yelled,
noticeably louder than anyone in his
immediate surroundings. ’

Webb kept tabs on his runners
throughout the first race by inter-
cepting their course at several

points.

“Right around the mile point, we
were first, third and fourth,” Webb
said. “West Virginia was second and
then they had a pack of girls right
behind our fifth girl.”

In the second ha1f‘of the race,
WVU runners captured the first,
fourth and sixth spots. Pitt junior
Lauren Shaffer took third, senior
Rachel Rothe was fifth, freshman
Suzette Bossart came in eighth and,
rounding out the Panther’s scoring
five, freshman Nicola Angstadt
placed 12th. _

pack,” Webb said. “That’s what
we’ve got to learn to do.” , '
In the end, Pitt beat WVU by a

single point, 27-28. The women’s 0

team also defeated St. Francis,
Duquesne, St. Bonaventure, Robert
Morris, Carnegie Mellon, Wheeling
Jesuit, Penn State-Altoona and
Clarion.

The men’s team faced only eight
opponents; WVU did not enter a
team. Successful against St.
Bonaventure, Robert
Wheeling Jesuit, PSU-Altoona and
Clarion, the men’s team lost to St.
Francis, Duquesne and CMU.

-Near the halfway point of the

men’s 4.2-mile race, Pitt held a sub-.

stantial number of the top spots.
“We’ve got allfof our guys in the
front pack!” Webb said ‘during the
race. “We’ve got all five in the top
15!” .
‘ However, Webb then added, with
a seemingly prescient ability, “A lot
can happen in the next half.”
Pitt'finished the race with only
two of its runners in the top 15.

. Freshman Jesse Mang finished 16th.

“They were in a nice pack at the
turnaround, then they started to fall
apart,” Webb said. “Probably just

not focused,'we need a little more ,

focus during the second half of the
race when things get tough.”

Pitt’s top runner, Michael Long,
finished eighth in the meet with a
time of -21:56. He was 30 seconds

_ behind first place andonly a second

ahead of Pitt’s second runner, fresh-
man Andrew Tomawick;

I “On anygiven day anyone can
pretty much do everything,” Long
said. “Today just happened to be my
day. I was out there, I was in the

pack and I felt good so I went with 1

it.” ~ .
Despite the setbacks and resul-
tant three losses, the “men’s team
showed visible improvement from
last year. p
All five of the men’s scoring

runners recorded times faster than ’
I .Pitt’s second fastest time at the same

meet a year ago. In addition, with
the exception _of senior Clinton
Kotuby, Pitt’s top five this year were
all freshmen. _ /0

“We’v-e started a whole new
era,” Long said; “I’m told this is the
first time that we’ve been called a
team. We’ve always had a couple
good individuals, but our freshman
class coming in, supported -by our
senior leadership, I think we have
one of the best teams Pitt’s ever
had.”

Panthers rack up more than
500 yards of offense in win

Kent State, page 15

capped a 76-yard drive that lasted
only 50-seconds. ’ '

On Rutherford’s second touch-
down pass —— Fitzgerald’s first of the
game — Fitzgerald set a Pitt record by
catching touchdown passes in seven
consecutive games, a record formerly
held by Antonio Bryant.

With Rutherford as quarterback,
Pitt’s offense scored fiv"e touchdowns,
four thrown by Rutherford and one
rushing touchdown from running back
Brandon Miree, with no scoring drive
lasting longer than four and a half
‘minutes. .

“Rod Rutherford obviously ener-
gized us. He’s our starting quarter-
back. He’s been und_er a lot of duress
and pressure. He’s part of our family
and our players responded when he
got in there,” Harris said. “When he

got -in there, he looked like a fifth year

senior.” »

“Rod is our leader, he’s the gener-

al of our team, and you feel a little

more comfortable with him,”

Fitzgerald said. i
Rutherford led the offense until

the 14:22 mark of the third quarter. A-

Kent State holding penalty late in the
third quarter resultedin a safety, Pitt’s
first since September 2000, giving Pitt
a 37-3 lead and a comfortable cushion
on the scoreboard. Rutherford left the
game and Getsy returned to finish it.

Getsy’s fourth-quarter work was
decidedly better than his earlier
appearance in the game. He completed
3 of 7 for 32 yards, including a 16-
yard completion to Steve Buches that
helped set up a 22-yard field goal by
David Abdul.

“It gave me a chance toredeem
myself. It definitely helped me out to
get. back in there,” Getsy said.

= “Luke, for his first time, I thought
he did solidly. And when he got in
later, I thought he exhibited some real
good football sense, especially when
we’re trying to run the clock out,”
Harris said. ‘.‘Luke’s a cool cucum-
ber.” ‘ » '
Impressive as the Pitt offense was
— 522 total yards, five touchdowns,
34 minutes of possession and 43
points — the defense was equally as
imposing to Kent State’s offense.

After the first Kent drive that
resulted in a field goal, Pitt held the
Golden Flashes to six first downs, 105
yards of total offense, 20 minutes of
ball possession and zero points.

“I thought Kent State played hard
and I thought they had a good plan,
especially early,” Harris said. “I think
we settled down after that and did a
real nice job on defense.”

As convincing a win Saturday’s
game was, the team knows that it was
far from a ﬂawless performance. '

“We were all a little nervous com-
ing out. We just got to fine tune
[things] and not make the same mis-
takes next week,” Fitzgerald said.

“We had a few mistakes, but the
coaches cleared ‘ it up, the players
cleared it up, and we just came out
and had a great game,” linebacker
Clint Sessions said. “Well, not a great
game, but it’s a first game. It’s a first
win. It feels good.”

Harris should have given Getsy the chanceto perf

Madness, page 15

After the game, Harris was rather
secretive about whether Rutherford
would be punished further.

“There is some team discipline
that we have begun and that will
remain our information,” Harris said.
“Right now, I don’t want to say any-
thing more about it because there’s a
legal process going on right now.
[Rutherford] suffered an obvious
penalty and he’s being taken care of
with our team.”

An obvious penalty? It’s hard to

i believe that Rutherford is upset about

throwing for nearly 300 yards and four

scores.

A more obvious penalty would
have been to let Rutherford watch from
the sidelines as Pitt lost to the Golden
Flashes. I’m not saying that would
have happened, but it is a possibility.

Remember South Florida. two
years ago? Harris probably does, and
perhaps that’s,why he wasn’t goingpto
suspend Rutherford.

If he had suspended Rutherford,
Harris wouldn’t be the first coach to do
it. Virginia Tech head coach Frank
Beamer suspended backup quarterback
Marcus Vick and starting linebacker
Brandon Manning from the Hokies
game against James. Madison on

Saturday for violating team rules.

And how much would Pitt’s
offense have suffered without
Rutherford in the game? Luke Getsy
was a few dropped passes away from
putting the Panthers on the board in the
first quarter. » A

While his numbers weren’t spec-
tacular — Getsy completed justthree
of 11 passes — Harris didn’t give his
backup much of a chance to show what
he could do. ,

Pitt uncharacteristically started the
game with seven straight running
plays, and the Panthers kept the ball on

_the ground for nine of their 13 plays in

the first quarter. When Getsy returned
