health benefits ‘has been cause for

Much like the rest of Pitt’s cam-
pus, the Cathedral of Learning will
soon be under construction.

Already boasting 26 Nationality
Rooms, the University approved

‘the additionof a_Filipino nationali-
ty room earlier in May.

The announcement came after
several meetings with Filipino
community leaders, during which

commitment issues were discussed.

Warren Bulseco, an architect
with WTW Architects, initiated the
project, according to Maxine
Bruhns, director of the Nationality
Rooms and intercultural exchange
programs. . » '

Bulseco’s firm also suppliedan
architect to design the Indian
Room, which was dedicated in
January.

Bulseco studied the feasibility
of creating a Filipino room, and
approached approximately 20 lead-
ers withinrtheilocal Filipino com-
munity, including doctors ‘and
lawyers, Bruhns said,

Now that the room has been
sanctioned space on the third ﬂoor

     May showers

DAVE McANALL/ ASSISTANT PHOTO ED/TOR

April showers came aiew weeks late to the Pittsburgh area as the city was
doused with rain and severe thunderstorms on Tuesday night.

One more test  

JESSICA TURAK
The Pitt News

While most Pitt students were busy-

playing ultimate frisbee or volleyball on
the Cathedral of Learning’s lawn during
the last few days of April, ﬁve of their
schoolmates were on their way to Bentley
College in Waltharn, Mass. to compete in

“the varsity sport of the mind.”

The 2000 College Bowl National
Championship Tournament was held just
outside of Boston from April 28 through
April 30 and tested students on their
knowledge of history, science, literature,
religion, social sciences, the arts, sports,
current events, multicultural topics and
even popular culture.

Eric Steinhauser, Gerald Bergen,
Amie Dupin, Brian Jacobs, and Adam
Schaible opted to endure more testing
even ‘after their traditional ﬁnals had
ended. They were selected at an intramur-
al tournament held at the Wﬂliarn Pitt

,Union last fall. ‘

The winning students then competed
in the Regional Championship
Tournament. A win against Johns Hopkins
University landed them a spot in the
national tournament. 0

According to team member Brian
Jacobs, the ﬁve students were selected for

both their overall performance as well as
the subject areas in which they performed
best.

“We all have certain areas we are
strong in,” Jacobs said. “What the school

is looking for is a team that is well bal-

anced. You don’t want a team with ﬁve
English majors» or ﬁve science majors
because then the team may not perform as
well in other areas.”

‘Jacobs, "who is a dual chemistry and
anthropology major, says his strength is
science, while tearrrrnate Eric
Steinhauser’s expertise lies mainly in cur-
rent events.

“I read the newspaper, but other than
that, there is no real way to prepare for the
event,” Steinhauser said. “In the past,'I
have looked over a list of people who died
recently because those tend to be popular
questions.”

Having a well-balanced team certain-
ly proved beneﬁcial. At the end of compe-
tition on Saturday, April 29, Pitt was in
first place. During the final day of
competition, however, the team lost two
of its members, seniors Gerald Bergen and
Adam Schaible, ‘who had to ﬂy back to
Pittsburgh in time for graduation.

Virrthout two key players, the team
lost "all three rounds of the day. This

ence, — while others are returning for
their regular monthly treatment. In any

case, each patient is moments away '”

from being wheeled into the treatment
suite for their electroconvulsive thera-
py, more commonly known as ECT or
“electroshock.” It’ is performed at

Western Psychiatric. Institute and '

Clinic, which performs ECT on more
than 300 patients per year, about 40
percent of whom are outpatients.

The procedure lasts all of about 15
minutes. ‘

Patients are first administered a
general anesthesia and muscle relax-
ant.While asleep, two electrodes that
hang from wires ‘ strlmg to a machine
resembling a stereo receiver are placed
on the scalp, either unilaterally (on one
side of the head) or bilaterally (both
sides).

‘On the more, advanced computer-
ized version, like thoseat WPIC, the
.doctor sets the. dial to the patient’s age
and then hits the switch.-

‘ ' Depending upon one’s seizure
threshold, which is determined by a
gradual increase in voltage, a current
of approximately 140 volts passes
through the brain, triggering simulta-
neous nerve cell firing that induces a
seizure lasting about one minute.
Doctors know the seizure is occur-

. ring because the foot,.which does not

receive the muscle relaxant due to a
tight blood pressure strap‘ wrapped
around the ankle, begins twitching and
jerking.

It is unclear exactly how _a seizure
helps to relieve such symptoms of
mental illness as catatonia, delusions,

\ hallucinations and suicidal tendencies,

    

all of which are associated with
depression, mania and schizophrenia.

I But a series of between six and 12
treatments can normalize chemical

, imbalances within the brain, including
those that affect mood, appetite and,

sleep. , T V V
Relief for most people is only tem-
porary. Many patients return for multi-

7 - ple--treatrnents or are prescribed psy-

chotropic medications, following ECT
to." 1 help‘, prevent- symptoms ' from
becoming extreme. ‘ f . ,’

Wiskeman,‘ pro gram‘ director of ECT.’ at
WPIC, who works andfcommunicates
ECT ‘.‘treats’ the ‘affective compo-
nent only — not the personality,” she
said. “Can it change stressors at home
and .work? No.” If it could fix these
things, Wiskeman said she would start
at home. - \ , - .

The History , T 3 _
Despite the lack of definitive

understanding of ECT, it remains the .

longest-running organic psychiatric
treatment since it was introduced in
1938.

. Italian doctors, Ugo’ Cerletti and
Lucino Bini discovered shock to be a
potential treatment for psychiatric ill-
ness following a visit, strangely
enough, to a hog farm. I

Prior to being slaughtered, farmers p

would shock the pigs with a metal
prong to calm the squealing animals in

order to make the farmer’s job easier. ' /

They also knew that another doc-
tor, Laidislas Meduna had observed in

1935 that schizophrenic patients with ,

epilepsy were notably calmerjfollow,-'
ing a seizure. '
Meduna’s work opened a new era
of psychiatric practice. Other methods
to induce seizures, such as insulin
therapy and 'Metrazol, were also used,
but did not prove to be as safe as elec-
tric shock, which by the 1940s was
accepted worldwide and administered
regularly throughout mental hospitals
and institutions. _ .
But then electroshock acquired a
bad reputation because of abuses that
occurred in overcrowded, understaffed
state facilities. A I _

SHOCK

“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”
were not entirely unrealistic, though,
according to the Rev. George Deville,
who in 1964 went to work as chaplain
for Woodville State Hospital in
Pittsburgh. “It was like going back to
the Dark Ages. ‘Shock therapy patients
would have second degree burns on
their heads, and the doctor would say
give him more.”

Some doctors believed the more
severe the seizure, the more effective
the treatment, which later proved not
to be so, he said.

‘Electroshock became so widely
used in facilities that patients were
placed on maintenance doses. In 1955,
the United States housed more than
559,000 mentally ill patients, whose
average stay lasted about 10-12 years.
(Today there are approximately
130,000 with an average stay of three
to four months.) ‘

The introduction of tranquilizers
in 1954-55 reduced the use of ECT by
90 percent, as well as the number of
inpatient stays.

However, ECT remained the pre-
ferred choice for ‘many with severe
conditions or for those who did‘ not
respond to medications and other
forms of treatment even after the sig-
nificant drop in inpatients. V

These individuals were unable to
eat, sleep or function or those so

FROM PAGE 3

extremely suicidal or violent they

could not wait weeks for medication to
take effect. iii .

According to Wiskeman,ithese are
the same criteria WPIC looks ‘for
before administering ECT to patients.
In 1972, state mental hospitals devel-
oped a Best Practices edict, which
regarded ECT as being “fraught with
controversy and perhaps danger,”
according to Dr. James Baird,
Mayview State Hospital psychologist.

In light of the edict, malpractice
insurance for ECT was too expensive
for state mental facilities already
struggling to operate on limited feder-
al funding, thus marking the end of
shock therapy at Mayview and other
state-run facilities.

Mayview agreed to send patients
requiring these services -to WPIC,
which today ‘averages only one or two
patients .per year from Mayview, said
Baird. '

A concept known as patients’.

rights soon took hold, requiring mental
facilities to get signed consent from
patients before administering treat-
ment. However, under certain circum-
stances, a judge will give guardianship
to a family member or institution,
allowing them to sign on the patient’s
behalf.

Mayview does not get involved
with these cases, Baird said, because,
“we want the patient to agree.”

opposition to electroconvulsive
therapy.

Steinhauser and a few of his team-
mates were used to the competition before
even arriving at Bentley. Steinhauser also
competes more informally throughout the
year as member and president of Pitt’s

Organized through the University

Honors College, the club meets Thursday

nights during the traditional academic

year to practice. But _ even this gave‘

Steinhauser and his teammates no indica-
tion of what to expect at the national tour-
nament. V

, “It was very interesting watching the
people from Ford Motor Company, who
sponsored the event,” he said. “They were

ﬁlming and had all these PR people there.
It was very different. The whole thing had
a real corporate ﬂavor to it.”

Although the focus of the weekend
was on the competition, students were
given an afternoon to explore Boston. In
addition to seeing the city, they got to
know students from across the nation.

“We hung out with some students
from the University of Southern
California,” Jacobs said. “We also found
out that two of the students from Alaska-
Fairbanks were Pittsburgh natives. That
was interesting.”

5 Both Jacobs and Steinhauser plan on
competing in the intramurals again this
fall, in the hopes of making next year’s
team. _

“It’s not only a chance to compete and
have ftm,” ‘Jacobs said. “But you also get
to learn all sorts of fascinating, bizarre
information.”

CMU

Hospital and the University of
Pennsylvania.

What separates Pitt from CMU
and the nine other universities offer-
ing benefits to same-sex partners is
that Pitt is considered a public school,
while the others are private institu-
tions.

CMU’s status as a private univer-
sity allows for much more freedom
when making controversial decisions
because the university receives very
little funding from the public sector.

Carnegie Mellon receives only $5
million in state aid for its Pittsburgh
Super Computing Center and other
research projects.

FROM PAGE 1

“CMU is a private institution,
while we are state—related,” said Ken
Service, the University’s spokesman.
“We have to take into account the
views and policies of the state gov-
ernment when making these deci-
sions.”

Service said that the University
fears it would lose appropriations
from the state by extending health
insurance and benefits to same—sex
couples.

Last summer three—quarters of the
state legislature voted to completely

cut off state funding for institutions

that offer same sex benefits, but the
bill did not make it through the state
senate. ,

“That became a pretty clear indi-
cation of the members of the House of

Representatives’ opinion on the mat-
ter,” Service said. . .
Along with legal action, Pitt has
hosted rallies and hunger strikes
protesting the University’s decision
not to recognize employees same—sex

partners when doling out health care.

benefits.

Although similar protests never,

took place at CMU, the school did
hear some complaints from alumni.

Hail said that some alumni did not
support the measure, but never direct-
ly stated that they would stop con-
tributing money to the school.

“We studied other ' schools who
had gone through this same process
and over the long term alumni giving
and support to the institution had not
been diminished,” Hail said. I

* CMU grants same-sex benefits;

Pitt should follow example

Two days ago, Carnegie
Mellon did a good thing: after 90
minutes of discussion, the govern-
ing board voted to accept same-sex
beneﬁts for university employees.

Pitt has been fighting the same pol-

icy for two years.
While it may be surprising that
a conservative school like CMU

‘ would take such a liberal stance,

Pitt is embroiled in a very different
situation. CMU is a private school,
which means that state contribu-
tions are limited to very speciﬁc

' gifts and grants, whereas Pitt is

largely dependent upon state fund-
ing. Because the state doesn’t rec-
ognize same-sex marriages, Pitt is
not legally required to provide
benefits. And it’s possible that the
state would withdraw funding if
Pitt changes its practices.

Pitt could oppose the law, join-
ing forces with other state schools
and working to reform current leg-

islation. But instead the adminis-

tration has sought cover along with
Penn State, and now the trustees
are taking heat from faculty law-
suits. Never mind the fact that

some couples may not receive ade-

quate health care. '
Protesters have done a good
job of rustling up some media
attention. Newspapers across the
country covered the lawsuit, which.

at least‘ granted the issue the atten-
tion it deserved. But the adminis-

tration will not budge until the
. state officially recognizes same-

sex marriages.

And that should be the next‘
step of the Equal Rights Alliance:
rrrigrate protests from the William

Pitt Union lawn to Harrisburg, i

where progressives can battle in
Pennsy1vania’s main political
arena. The Board of Trustees has
sold out, true, but the problem lies

at the state level. You can’t put“

your opponent in checkrnate by
nailing apawn. ‘

CMU’s act is admirable, but
not exactly courageous. The gov-
ernment will continue to pump
money into its science departments
for military purposes regardless of
how CMU prefers to relegate its
own money. If CMU loses a couple
million dollars, it will more than
make up for it in tuition and pri-
vate donations.

But Pennsylvania will not risk
confronting all its state colleges at
once. Civil rights activists can’t be
modest about an issue of this polit-
ical magnitude, because more than

-health benefits are at stake. In

order to win the fight, the gay
rights activists must be visible on
campuses, in the workplace, and
on paper. '

Down  the mummy TV!

I am utterly appalled. I was watch-

hoping to, catch old episodes of my
favorite syndicated comedies, and out
of nowhere, some shriveled up old guy
is front and center on my 13-inch
screen. I quickly changed the channel.
After a minute or so of tired game show
reruns, I switched back to the channel
with the old guy. Admittedly, ‘I thought
it was going to be one of those special
real—1ife stories like, “When Shniveled—
Up Old Guys Attack.” » . .

Well, as it turns out, that wasn’t an 

old guy at all. At least, it wasn’t an old
guy that was alive. But, he was old all
right. About 5,000 years old! ’

watching a bunch of doctors poke
through some ‘Pharaoh’s busted yard
sale? Come off it! Sure, I could video-
\tape myself cleaning out my garage and
give it a few millennia, but why would I
care then? I wouldn’t be famous. At
least, not in a way that Icould appreci-
ate. ,

That’s why the networks are—choos-
ing now as the time to be tomb robbers.
They figure the statute of limitations

royalties, so they’re cleaning up. ‘And

.who foots the bi-llifor their archaeologi-

buys the adtime, but, in the long run,

 

   

 

hard-working American people have to
pay for it.

For my nickel, I want to see some
beautiful, voluptuous, tube top-wearing
brunette kissing some nerdy, big-eared
freak with a bad haircut. There are plen-
ty of shows that live up to that demand.

Or I’d like to see a sequel to that
movie they made ‘about millionaire
bachelor Rick Rockwell getting mar-

and some easy legal jargon. Now that,

In 129 years, Cedar Point has
added, six.-world record-breaking
rides to their park. On May 13, they
introduced yet another, the new
Millennium Force roller coaster.

Millennium Force is the park’s
14th roller coaster and breaks
numerous world records, including
the tallest coaster at 310 ‘feet, fastest
coaster — reaching speeds of 92
miles per hour, the longest drop on a
roller coaster 0-. 300 feet, first
coaster to top 300 feet, first coaster
to utilize and elevator lift chain sys-
tem and the steepest non-inversion
banked turn on a roller coaster —
122” degrees. . .

The coaster has been termed a
“giga-coaster” for its extreme height
and its record-breaking 300—foot-tall

Cruisin’ for abr’

ROBERT DITTMAN

Staff Writer

Memorable thrillers depend
on an impossible, or at least an
extremely daunting, task pitted
against suffocating time limita-
tions and a pessimistic outlook.
“Impossible” missions are a step
or two above very difficult mis-
sions and are best set against an
exotic background with irre-
sistibly colorful and resourceful
characters versus ingenious and
ruthlessly sinister villains. At
least on this score “Mission
Impossible: 2” starts off with a
bang. .

After Brian De Palma's 1996
feature film “Mission
Impossible”

   

became a
runaway hit,
a sequel was
inevitable
and now
arrives as
one of the
most eager-
ly awaited
films of the

summer movie season.

For fans of “Mission
Impossible” it may be the film to
see. Cruise (who also produced),
Ving Rhames and Anthony
Hopkins (in a brief but important
role) join a proven array of on-
and off—camera talent. Notable
scriptwriter Robert Towne
penned the screenplay.

Behind the camera is action
master John Woo, directing what
is an improbable but intriguing
plot dealing with the increasing-
ly topical biological warfare and
other cloak-and-dagger exploits.
He fills in the holes with trade-
mark stylishness and dizzying
action sequences; .At sever-
al points during “MI:2” Woo bor-
rows from his 1997 entry .“Face
Off.” Action, especially during
the second half, becomes non-
stop and details become vital. It
almost comes across as heresy to
point out ﬂaws, although there
are relatively few. I V

Predictably, Cruise, Rhames,

Dougray Scott and the rest of the

cast are in top form as are the
glossy tech credits. So why is it
that director Woo lets our empa-

‘a.n d

The Millennium Force uses a
newly designed elevator cable sys-
tem instead of the traditional lift
chain, to carry the coaster trains up
the towering hill. This new lift sys-

 

tem pro-
vides a

ride up
that first

A l o n g
with that smooth ride, the designers
built tiered-seats, similar to stadium
seating, into the coaster’s cars to
allow for better viewing

The “thrill ride” lasts two min-
utes and 45 seconds, covers 13 acres
of territory in Frontiertown and
takes the riders through two pitch-

1 black tunnels.

Top 0’ the drop: th vie fr atop the Mi|enniFrc

thy lapse at several important
points? It may be that even as a
renowned action director, Woo is
not as good with slower, more
thoughtful sequences.

“MI: 2” delivers a sizable
helping of the goods, but does
not do so consistently. Cruise
fans and Woo devotees will for-
give the film’s weaknesses in a
heartbeat, but that doesn’t
change the fact that Woo could
have made a tighter, more
involving film. It is really the
difference between pretty darn
good and great. Woo has set for
himself a standard to be fol-
lowed. This is no place for laps-
es. .

Perhaps the key is the differ-
ence between extraordinary and
breathtaking action sequences
and maintaining solid audience
involvement. There was no lack
of resources to draw from. The
film should have been left in the

oven just alittle while longer.

A final note, this review will

self-destruct immediately after

reading. The film will last much
longer, although not altogether
deservedly so. a

The Pitt News

I thought I liked folk music, or at
least I thought I knew what it was. After
all, my music collection contains the
requisite amounts of Bob ‘ Dylan and
Cat Stevens, and I usedto listen to
Peter, Paul & Mary with my parents. I
know that Woody Guthrie is considered

to be the founding father of this genre,

so how could E

 

performers as Bruce
Springsteen, Soul -Asylum’s Dave
Pirner, Indigo Girls, Guthrie’s son Arlo
and actor Tim Robbins. A

Springsteen contributed two tracks,
“Riding in My Car_’7tand “Plane Wreck
at Los Gatos,”. the latter only marginal-
ly less painful than the first. “Car” is a
children’s song, with lyrics like, ‘The
horn on my car goes beep—beep/ The
horn on my car goes beep—beep.” I
rolled up my own car windows while
listening to it, terrified of being busted
by someone I know.

The highlights of the album (or,

maybe just the anti—lowlights) were its
female performances. DiFranco’s
haunting performance of “Do Re Me,”

 

together to sing

and Indigo Girls’ “Ramblin’ Round”
were more loose adaptations of the
Guthrie originals. I found myself wish-
ing more of the artists had done this,

because it showed how Guthrie inﬂu-

enced their personal music styles.

The rest of the musicians, like Billy
Bragg singing “Against the Law” and
Dave Pirner with “Pretty Boy Floyd”
just seemed to be desperately imitating
Guthrie’s Vocal ‘style — it ‘was pathetic

Earl and Know win ECAC

MARIO MACHI
Sports Editor

Gaining momentum with wins by seniors
Chantee Earl and Gwen Knorr, Pitt’s women’s
track team garnered a second place finish in
the 2000 Eastern College Athletic Conference
Outdoor Track and Field Championships, held
last weekend in Princeton, N.J.

Senior leadership also showed on the
men’s side, as Jack Jeffreys and Bryan

Johnson, a pair of seniors, led the men to 21st‘

place in the Intercollegiate Association of
Amateur Athletics of America
Championships. *

ECAC Outdoor Track and Field
Championships

As usual, the story for the Pitt women was
Earl. She defended her title in the 800 meters
with a school record—breaking mark of 2 min-
utes, 3.14 seconds, which was over two sec-
onds better than the rest of the field.

Earl has not lost an 800-meter race this

season in either indoor or outdoor meets.‘

Also, Earl teamed with Mera Belisle, ‘Tia
Tabb and Tasha Peart to qualify for the NCAA
championships in the 4x400-meter relay

Knorr, who finished second at the Big
East Outdoor Championships in the javelin,
came through with a stadium-record throw of
47.64 meters to win her ﬁrst title.

Nicole Kelly, the Big East champion in
the heptathlon, finished fourth in the event at
the ECAC Championships, just behind team-
mate Bettina Lee.

Belisle and Peart each garnered three All-
ECAC honors. I

Belisle ﬁnished second in the 200-meter

. race with a time of 23.87 and came in sixth in

the 100, at 12.00 seconds. ‘

Peart, on the other hand, ran a time of
24.15, good enough for fourth in the 200, and
came in just ahead of Belisle in the 100, with
a time of 11.99 seconds. _

Pitt placed in two other events.
Sophomore Stacey Taylor came in fourth in
the high jump, the same finish she posted at
the Big East championships.

The Panthers’ A 3,200—meter relay team,
consisting of Earl, Neema Payne, Beth Rocks
and Dee Cole, placed fifth in the event.

Overall, Pitt totaled 67.5 points, ranking
the Panthers second, 11.5 points behind
Georgetown. The top six finishers were all
schools from the Big East Conference.

Usually when a team makes the news
for its off-the—ﬁeld actions, that’s not a
good thing. However, the Pitt wrestling

theory. Although, _the season‘ ended in

and skated off with help, a ‘blood-soaked
towel against his head. The gash, which
required 40 stitches, came only four days
after LeClair was inadvertently hit with

Devils’ goalie Martin Brodeu_r’s sticking a;

skirmish along the boards.

LeClair looked like the poster boy for
abuse. His right eye was swollen and the
“ringer” had "atwo-inch radius. His nose
was sliced open and also required numer-
ous stitches to close. , _ , ~- A

There’s little. the league  do to cut
down on the number of accidents like the
ones that happened ‘ to LeClair. and
N emchinov, but it still represents violence,
an aspect of the game that children should-
n’t be subjected to. ‘ .

I think that’s why the NI-IL“still falls
well behind baseball, basketball and foot-
ball in fan popularity here in the Unite

. States‘. ‘

In‘ baseball, players get hit with.pitch-
es and thereis an occasional bench-clear-

ingnbrawl, but rarely is the game viewed as f
‘violent. , v ‘ '

Basketball has; gotten progressively

worse with melees during a game, but the
only blood» is a scraped knee here and

—.I

there. ‘.

Football may be the most physical
sport, but violence is at a  during
the games. Football players have been
doing most of the violence off the ﬁeld, i.e.
Ray Lewis, Rae Carruth. 

Hockey sticks are dangerous, and it’s
the only major sport where players carry
around potential weapons as they are play-
mg.

_ Kids do not need to see NHL players
using their sticks in violent ways or they

will feel it necessary to do the same if they -

play.

, I’m not saying the NHL should stop I

using sticks, or that it should fold, but par-

ents should take some time to think about .

allowing their children to attend or watch
games on television. a

I love the game of hockey, but have
been appalled at what I have seen in the
past few seasons. The head is a ﬁagile
thing. It doesn’t.need large wooden and
aluminum objects being swung at it at high
speeds. _ ' .-

until the top of the fifth inning.

The Irish closed the gap to 5-4 at
that point, but Pitt struck back in the
bottom of the sixth with two more runs
to regain the three—run lead.

Britt and Mike Pokrzywinski had
singles sandwiched around a strikeout,
and Rykaceski followed "with a bunt
single to load the bases. Lydic singled
as well, scoring the Panthers’ sixth run
and Pokrzywinski scored the seventh
on a wild pitch.

Things looked good for the

Panthers, but Notre Dame put 11 runs '

across in the eighth to blow out Pitt, 15-
7.

Irvin started the inning, but gave up
three runs to tie the game at 7-7. Jeremy
Rossi came in, but could not record an
out and gave up three hits and four

runs, before Kevin Lazeski replaced‘

him.

Lazeski didn’t fare much‘ better,
getting one out, but giving» up four hits
and four runs in the process.

“It was one of those things,” said
Pitt head coach Joe Jordano. “It was
just amazing that we were one strike

away from getting the second out in

that inning.”
“But we’ll learn from that, and
improve next year,” added J ordano.

Coughenour lasted just 5 2/3
innings, and gave up 10 hits and seven
runs, six of which were earned. He
walked four batters and struck out two.

His counterpart, Brownlie, the Big
East Most Outstanding Pitcher of the

Year in the regular season, went 7 1/3 ,

innings, giving up 10 hits and three
runs, and struck out five Panthers,
while walking two.

Barry Walsh finished off the game

for the Scarlet Knights, earning the

save for his 1 2/3 innings of hitless
relief.

For Rea, it was his 10th home run
of the season and he ﬁnished the game
2 for 4 with two runs batted in.

Lydic, second baseman Scott
Folmar and outfielder Erik Katchur
also added two hits apiece for the
Panthers. 1

“We made a couple of errors in the

. first inning that hurt us a bit, and we got

behind,” Jordano said. “We were able

to out into the lead, but Rutgers is an

outstanding team.”

Rutgers went on to }win the Big
East ‘title by defeating Seton Hall, 1-0,
on Brownlie’s shutout.

Pitt finishes the season at 31-24 and
made its first trip to the Big East tour-
nament in five years.
