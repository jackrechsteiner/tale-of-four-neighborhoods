4 berg says he will con-

sider a recent -Faculty
Assembly proposal urging cre-
ation of a joint committee to
study how Pitt might extend

. health beneﬁts to its employees’

same-sex partners.

But’ according to Norden-
berg, two major impediments
stand in the way of the open
discussion that Assembly mem-
bers seek on the issue:

0 Opposition to same-sex

. beneﬁts by some state lawmak-

ers, who have threatened to cut
Pitt’s funding if it extends health
coverage to gay and lesbian part-

l'lCI'S.

ACLU challenges PA  

law 

 

n an attempt to chop the
llegal legs out from under\

the University in a contro-
versial same-sex beneﬁts lawsuit,
American Civil Liberties Union
lawyers have challenged the con-
stitutionality of a Pennsylvania
statute designed to end the law-
suit. _ ‘

The statute, passed by the
state’s General Assembly in No-
vember, was cited by Pitt in its
Dec. 21 request in Allegheny
County Common Pleas Court
for a preliminary injunction to

halt proceedings in the four-'

year—old civil suit.
On April 20, Common Pleas

' Court’ Judge Robert C. Gallo

granted Pitt’s request, halting
proceedings that the Pittsburgh
Human Relations Commission
(HRC) had begun on the case.
On May 23, University law-
yers ﬁled for a permanent in-
junction. In response, ACLU
lawyers ﬁled a reply this week.
The lawsuit itself alleges that
Pitt discriminates based on sexual.
orientation by denying health in-

. surance beneﬁts to employees’

gay and lesbian partners.
ACLU attorney Roslyn M.
Litman, who represents the seven
current and former Pitt employ-
ees who are complainants in the
case, said the state statute was a
special law targeted at the law-
suit against Pitt. That would

~make the legislation unconstitu- .

tional, she said.

The Pennsylvania statute
prohibits city ordinances from
requiring state-owned or state-
related universities to provide
employee health care beneﬁts.

Litrnan said: “In a nutshell,

  

_ ° The ongoing lawsuit against
the University by seven of its
current and former employees,
who allege that Pitt violates its
own anti—discrimination policy
as well as the city’s anti—discrimi-
nation law in denying health ben-
eﬁts to same-sex partners.

InApril, anAllegheny County
Common Pleas Court judge
granted Pitt’s request for a tem-
porary injunction, suspending
Pittsburgh Human Relations
Commission proceedings in the
case. -But the University’s vic-
tory did not end the litigation,
Nordenberg I reminded Senate
Council on June 12..

See story on this page.

what we’re saying is: If Pitt is
right in their interpretation of
the November statute, saying
that the statute’s intention was
to’ remove the city’s jurisdiction
—— and that is Pitt’s argument —
then the legislation violates the
equal protection clauses of both
the U‘.S. and Pennsylvania con-
stitutions. VVhat the state is do-
ing is putting at a disadvantage a
classiﬁcation of people, mean-
ing gays and lesbians, who are
unable to marry by state law,
without advancing a rational ba-
sis for doing that.” _

Furthermore, she said, the
action of the state legislature il-
legally undermines the ‘city’s
right to make and enforce its
own ordinances and the right of

 

the HRC to exercise jurisdiction‘

in a matter lawfully‘ conferred
upon it. '
As the UniversityTimes went
to press, University spokesper-
son Ken Service said that Pitt’s
legal counsel had not received a

' copy of the ACLU’s ﬁling, so he

could not comment on it.

A copy of the ﬁlingwas mailed
June 20 to University lawyers.
The -mailing included a notice
that’Pitt must respond in writing
within 20 days of receiving the
ﬁling. ' .

_Throughout the legal pro

ceedings, the University has

maintained that its health insur-
ance beneﬁts policy, which is
based on employees’ marital sta-
tus, is legal and non-discrimina-
tory. ‘

In his April decision, Judge
Gallo ruled that the Pennsylva-
nia statute pre-empts any com-

Is the chancellor ruling out
creation of the proposed joint
committee of faculty, adminis-

' trators and trustees until the law-

suit is over?

“I’m not going to offer any
odds,” Nordenberg said after the
Council meeting. “I’ve made my
statement. I think the litigation

_ is a major impediment to engag-

ing in thekind of free and open
dialogue that the [Senate’s anti-
discriminatory policies] commit-
tee is seeking.” _

It was the anti-discriminatory
policies committee that origi-
nally proposed the joint com-

mittee idea. Faculty Assembly».
endorsed the proposal earlier this

month. _ A
Assembly members cited the
precedent of a similar ad hoc
committee that addressed Pitt’s
policy on South Africa-related
investments. Nordenberg him-
self served on that committee. “I
didsee good come out’of that
process then,” he told Senate

Council, “but I also know that-

what can happen. . .is shaped to a
considerable extent by the envi-
ronment in which that discus-
sion takes place.”

He compared Pitt’s situation
with that of Carnegie Mellon
University. In May, CMU’s gov-
erning board voted to extend
same-sex health beneﬁts. But

Chancellor Willeonsider group to study same-sex beneﬁts

unlike Pitt, Carnegie Mellon is a
private institution that’s not as
answerable to state lawmakers,

and CMU was not sued over the '

issue. Even without those com-
plications, Nordenberg noted,
CMU’s decision came only after
four years of discussions.
Nordenberg said: “There is a
simplistic way of looking at the
CMU example that sometimes

_ surfaces in comments and con-

versation. And that is, basically:
‘They're good people at CMU,

*‘ and they know what they’re, do-

ing. And they’re’ bad people at
Pitt, and they don ’t know what

Freshman credentials continue to improve

his fall, for the ﬁfth
consecutive year,
Pitt’s freshman class
will have stronger academic cre-

dentials than the one that pre-

ceded it.  -
Among the approximately
3,000 freshmen entering the

University, 34 percent are in the .

top 10 percent of their high
school graduating. class and 62
percent are in the top 20 per-
cent.

That’s up from 30 percent
and 55 percent, respectively, for
last year’s freshman class, and an
increase from l9percent and 43
percent, respectively, for fall
1995 freshmen.

More than 1,000 of this fall’s

freshmen graduated in the top
10 percent of their high school
classes, more than double the
460 freshmen who were in the
top 10 percent ﬁve years ago.
This year’s entering students
have an average combined SAT
score of 1189, 24 points higher
than last year and 50 points
higher than ﬁve years ago.
Nearly one—quarter of this
year’s freshmen are eligible to
enroll in Pitt’s Honors College,
morethan double the 340 who

'were eligible in 1995 and an 18
percent increase over last year. _.

To be Honors College—eligible,
students must rank in the top 10
percent of their high school
classes and have an average com-

bined SAT score of 1335.

Pitt received 72 percent more
applications this year (13,492)
than in 1995.

Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg. announced the freshman
statistics at the June 12 Senate
Council meeting. '

Nordenberg attributed the
increases in numbers and quality

of applicants to a combination of -

factors: classroom renovations,
new and upgraded residence
halls, enhanced technological in-

frastructure, outreach efforts-

such as the Pitt Arts program,
and an increased emphasis on
students spending time studying
abroad. '

Discrepancies
in Pitt salaries

To the editor:
In the May 1 1, 2000, Univer-
sity Times we learned more

- about the way the University‘

spends its money on salaries than
we have known in the past. Most
interesting to me, we began to
learn more about how the huge
discrepancies among salaries
within the_ same division have
developed over the years. It
would appear that there are two
reasons for this state of affairs.

First, the University has long
admitted that the market is more
important than merit in deter-
mining‘ salaries. That means
higher raises for faculty who can
attract outside offers, and higher
starting salaries in trendy disci-
plines.

Now the. University Times
has revealed another reason for
salary discrepancies within divi-
sions. It would appear that the
administration routinely distrib-
utes to departments a standard,
average raise for the budgeted
number of faculty members, re-
gardless of how many of those
positions are filled. That means
the average increment to indi-
vidual faculty members is higher,
in terms ofpercentage, than the
increment allotted _to individual
departments.

I am not sure I understand
exactly what is happening here.
VVhen I was chair ofmy depart-
ment, I often fought for two or
three years to replace a retiring

colleague,‘ oirione who had left

for a more prestigious ‘position,

I 'or"one' who had been denied ten-

ure, but I never saw any addition
to, the pool for salary increments
during these periods. Does that
mean we were budgeted for a de-
crease in size even before the
end ‘of the recent planning pro-
'cess? Iwas never told. .

I VVhatever the case, it would
appear that there are always a
number of budgeted but unfilled
positions in FAS that always
make the FAS average raise

higher than our departmental

allocation. I cannot imagine that
the administration simply allows
the raise that would accrue to
these positions, were they actu-

ally filled, to be distributed to
continuing faculty. That might
mean that the University is plan-
ning to hire at a rate inferior to
the market when the position is
eventually ﬁlled, but this seems
to me to be highly unlikely.iOr
the administration may simply
be using this device to explain a
strategy of increasing the rela-
tive size of the salary pool in
select departments.

In any event, it has long been
the case that the average raise to
continuing faculty at the Uni-
versity has been much higher in
percentage terms than the
amount distributed to a depart-
ment like ours. This suggests to
me that the University is pursu-
ing a two-tiered policy for the
support of departments, and
makes no provision for reward-
ing individual achievement out-
side favored departments.

If I have understood the situ-
ation correctly, it urgently needs
to be addressed, for it probably
contributes much more to fac—
ulty dissatisfaction with the com-
pensation structure at Pitt than
any comparison with salaries at
other AAU universities, whether

i private or public. We all under-

stand that higher average sala-
ries in California and Boston re-
spond in some measure to a

higher cost of living, and a dif-

ferent competitive environment.

..A’ ﬁrst—rate university deals

wwith such matters in away that ,
"makes "university decisions, on

compensation for example, seem
rational to faculty even when an
individual faculty member may
disagree with them. I hope that
Pitt will soon begin to address
questions of faculty compensa-

     

tion and other matters of Uni-

versity governance in new and
creative ways.

Creating a crisis

To the editor:

Recent newspaper articles
revealed that Pitt’s football coach
is one of the four highest ‘paid
employees of the University. His
salary is higher even than that of
the chancellor. I remember that
when Babe Ruth was told that
his $80,000 salary was greater
than that of President Hoover,
he responded: “VVhat kind of
year did the president have?”

Ordinarily, I would assume
that the football coach had a bet-
ter year than the chancellor. ‘But
that’s not what the Board of
Trustees said when it gave the ‘
chancellor his financial rewards.
Because of his_great year, they
gave him._a bonus  and. a per-

,centage_rais,e greater than that

dedicatedito faculty. The answer,
of course, is in Pitt spokesperson
Ken Service’s statement that it’s
a question of the market: Good
coaches cost more than any old
chancellor. Of course, with a
coach whose record is at or be-

that Pitt has been more egalitar-
ian than our peer institutions in
distributing salaries, and this has
resulted in Pitt salaries for some
disciplines and professions rank-
ing lower than the overall Pitt
"ranking in the AAU. Since the
entire argument for comparing
our salaries to national norms is
a market argument, it makes

‘ sense that the University salary

policy includes a provision for
devoting some of the salary in-
crement pool to addressing mar-
ket issues of the sort that we have
identified. Only if we take cog-
nizance of these market issues
will we be able to attract and
retain the faculty we need in each
area of the University.

For all of us who are con-
cerned to keep".-the Universi-ty’s
salaries competitive, it should
also be regarded as a positive
element in our recent experi-

of confidence 1

low .500, one wonders about the

“good” part. I have often stated

my opinion: We should get rid
of such anofnalies and absurdi-
ties as coaches who are involved
in activities that have nothing to
do with the main purpose of the
University.‘ But it’s the market
that dominates, and the people
who run the University have, in
their wisdom, chosen _to accept
the market economy ‘model. I
assume that we are in market
competition with Nebraska,
Penn State, Notre Dame and
Alabama.

At least for football coaches.
But what of other people — like
professors? In the current dis-

cussion of equal beneﬁts for __

same—sex partnerships, the board
of that other university up the
street from Pitt (which doesn’t
have _a serious sports program to
speak of) announced that they
were in competition with
Stanford and MIT and Harvard,

and since those universities were

ence that the salary pool made
available for raises has always
been somewhat larger than the
announced fractional increase
wouldindicate because the pool
is calculated from the budgeted
rather than the ﬁlled positions.’ I
do not know exactly how “the
salary increases for Professor
Russell's department were
handled during his time as de-
partment chair, but I am confi-

dent that the funds available to ‘

the overall faculty would have
exceeded the announced frac-
tional increase because the cen-
tral budgeting adjustmentswas
calculated in the same way then.
I have required that the full
amount that is budgetedfor sal-
ary increases be distributed to

_ continuing faculty, which is why

theaverage annual increase ex-
ceeds the percentage that is an-
nounced as the raise pool. I

Carnegie Mellon had to do what

or not, what really is at stake is
the University. The trustees and
administration would like to de-

Professor emeritus Kenneth
D. Rogers, known for a career
devoted to community health,
died June 6, 2000, following
major surgery. He was 79.

Rogers earned his bachelor's
degree from Depauw University
in Greencastle, Indiana, in 1942,
and upon graduation enlisted in

the Navy and enrolled at the

University of Cincinnati, earn-
ing a medical degree in three
years. As a Navy surgeon, Rogers
served on active duty until 1948
and was a member of the Navy
Reserves until 1956. The Cin-
cinnati native did his pediatric
residency at Cincinnati’s
Children’s Hospital.

In 1952, Rogers enrolled in
Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health. He earned a master’s
degree in 195 3 and that year was
named assistant professor of
maternal and child health at
GSPH. He was named associate
professor in 1957 and in 1960
became professor and‘ chair of

. community medicine at Pitt’s

medical school, a position he held
until his retirement in 1988.

Rogers was named professor
emeritus of clinical epidemiol-
ogy and continued as professor
of pediatrics, teaching ﬁrst-year
medical students, and pediatric
residents and fellows at
Children’s Hospital until his
death.

7 1 Kenneth D. Rogers

Long-time colleague Jack
Paradise, Pitt professor ofpedi-
atrics, said Rogers was incisive
and analytical. “He had an ex-
ceptionally keen mind that cut
to the heart ofproblems,” Para-
dise said. “He was outspoken; if
he didn’t agree with you he had
no trouble letting. you know
about it. On the other hand, he
was very warm and caring and
took a great interest in his stu-
dents and trainees.” .. 1

Louise Rogers said of her
husband: “He got a huge charge
out of watching his students go
on to have triumphs in their own
careers. He also had a wonderful
sense of humor and he loved
children and loved to amuse
them.”

Paradise said Rogers was es-
pecially interested in commu-
nity health. “VVhat hewanted to
do most, I think, was to extend
the fruits of medical knowledge
to the community.”

At the medical school, Rogers
co—directed the Western Penn-
sylvania Health Preceptorship
Program, which provided com-
munity—based clinical experience
for about 70 students each sum-
mer. He also was director of the

school’s Stu-dent Summer Re-

search Program, which provided

basic and clinical science experi-

ence for 40 students annually.
In the 19605, Rogers helped

develop the Matilda Theiss Cen-
ter in the Hill District, one of the
city’s first health centers. He
served as the center’s director
for 19 years.

Rogers was aconsultant with
the Allegheny Health Depart-
ment’s Technical ‘Review Com-

mittee for Infant Mortality, as ’

well as for Pittsburgh Children’s
Hospital Institutional Board,
reviewing research applications
for their scientiﬁc merit.

“He was looked to. for advice
in a variety of research activi-
ties,” Paradise said. “He was just
a wealth of information in the
community health field.”

Rogers was an adviser to many
local agencies, including Allegh-

eny County Easter Seal Society,

the Pennsylvania Association for

_ the Blind, United Way of Al-

legheny County, Pittsburgh
Public School District, Keystone
Oaks School District and the

' Pennsylvania State Health De-

partment. .
He was on the board of Pitts-
burgh Black Action, 1970-1985,
serving as the organization’s
president from 1974 to 1976.
Rogers was a member of, or
consultant to, several organiza-
tions, ‘including the American
Public Health Association, the
American Academy of Pediat-
rics, the National Board ofMedi—
cal Examiners, the World Health

—Organization, the National In-

stitutes of Health, the Interna-
tional Epidemiology Associa-
tion, the National Academy of
Science and the National Cen-
ter for Health Services Research.

‘Among his many honors were
the President’s Award from the
American Academy of Pediat-
rics; Physician ofthe Year 1989
from Pitt’s School of Medicine
alumni; Pediatrician of the Year
1.995 from the Pennsylvania
chapter of the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics; a special award
forservices to the Navajo people
from the U.S. Public Health Ser-
vice; the University of Lourence
Marques Award for national
child health service ‘ to
Mozambique, and the Thaddeus

3 Campbell Award for his contri-

butions to the development of
the University of Pittsburgh.

Louise Rogers said garden-
ing was her .husband’s favorite
way to relax. “He loved the land
and he loved to work the land,”
she said.

In addition tohis wife, who
resides in Valencia, Rogers is
survived by his sister, Ruth R.

.diana.

I am disturbed that the Uni-

cause of the atmosphere created
by the board and the administra-

a malaise and an unhappiness
that mustbe taken seriously. One
young scholar goes off to the

that they are prepared to an-
nounce to the academic world
that YES! we are committed to

competition with the Bob-

When I came .to Pitt in the

mid-1960s, people still talked
about the vision of the late Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld: to make Pitt
the Harvard on- the Monon-
gahela. Later, Wes Posvar had
the vision of Pitt as an interna-
tional university. Some of these
men’s dreams were laughable,
some were exciting. But at least
they had dreams. They had vi-
sions of what the University

could be. Asanybody at Bob]

Jones University can tell you:
Where ther_e~is no vision, the
people shall perish.

U.S. auto manufacturers '—-— Ford,

that they did not want to lose

for sticking with this ﬁght, de-
spite Judge Gallo’s ruling.

At this point in this issue, it is

u-tterly amazing to me that Chan-
cellor Nordenberg and allies
continue to insist that denying

health beneﬁts to this group of

employees is not only non-dis-
criminatory, but right. VVhile the
chancellor may counter that he
has never stated that it is “right”
to do this, his actions and the
actions of the University mem-
bers who support this denial is
nothing less than benign neglect
of the needs of probably. hun-
dreds of University employees,

,?

ering that the‘University’s pri-
mary health insurancecarrier has
offered to extend beneﬁts, and it
has been-proven that offering
these beneﬁts will not greatly
increase benefit costs to the
University. .
I would like the chancellor
and allies (as well as all Univer-
sity employees) who are married
and able to have their spouse and
children receive health beneﬁts,
to imagine their situation with
one difference: that they have to
pay out of their own pocket

I have been in a committed ‘

years. My partner and I, like
many other Americans, work in
a two—income household, are
paying extensive student loans,
pay our taxes, volunteer in our
community, andlive a rather
average life...often times pay-
check to paycheck. After being
laid off last year, my partner is
now working as a p,ara-profes-

sional in her ﬁeld, but unfortu- _

nately with no benefits whatso-
ever. We pay $200 per month
for her health beneﬁts alone, and
as a result, we had to choose

between her health beneﬁts and ‘

her pension plan. While we of
course are still working towards

I the day when she will have an-

other professional position with
full beneﬁts, it has been some-
times difﬁcult adding that extra
cost to our monthly bills. Being
able to pay for -her beneﬁts
through my job at Pitt would
save us over $2 ,40O a year. That,
chancellor, is the reality of this
situation. My current commit-

'ment is no different thanjthe

employees who work hard for, I

and represent, this institution.
It is especially amazing, consid-

marriages of my friends and col-

have combined ﬁnances, have

neys for each other, share our
possessions and living space, and
plan our future and hopefully
retirement together around our
careers, dreams and potentially
raising children together.

If Chancellor Nordenberg
and the University chose to do
the right thing, it could be
worked out. If there are non-

of my colleagues in the same
level of a relationship receive as

ployment...based solely on a
piece of paper stamped by the

I urge the chancellor and

effortsand wordsof the Faculty

UNIVERSITY TIMES

- U. of Minnesotaisojciolo gist

chosen as director of UCIS

fter an international

search, Pitt has

named a new direc-
tor for the University Center for
International Studies (UCIS).

William I. Brustein, Distin-
guished McKnight University
Professor and a Morse—Alumni
Distinguished Teaching Profes-
sor of Sociology at the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, will become
head of UCIS on Jan. 1.

In 1992, Brustein was named
director of the Center for Euro-
pean Studies at Minnesota and
held that position until 1995,
when he became chair of the
Department. of Sociology. He
was a visiting scholar at the Free
University ofBerlin in 1989 and
at the London School of Eco-
nomics and Political Science in
1999.

In announcing the appoint-
ment, Provost James V. Maher
wrote, “I have great conﬁdence
in Dr. Brustein’s ability to pro-
vide the leadership that will en-
sure the "maintenance and
strengthening of the interna-
tional dimension at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. He clearly pos-
sesses relevant past administra-
tive experience and has demon-
strated an appreciation for the
accomplishments realized by the
University Center for Interna-
tional Studies as well as the chal-

.. leng¢$..that i,.t. is,.'faci_.ng-.1’ .- . -. . - _

Maher called Brustein a
scholar of international stature
in historical sociology. In addi-
tion to being UCIS director,
Brustein will be a tenured pro-
fessor in the Department ofSo—
ciology and a UCIS professor.

He will replace Burkart
Holzner, who will step down
June 30. Holzner will remain at
Pitt as UCIS professor and pro-
fessor of sociology and public
and international affairs. He has

been director of UCIS since i

1980. I

Maher announced that
George E. Klinzing will be UCIS
interim director, effectiveJuly 1.
Klinzing is vice provost for.re-
search and professor of chemical
engineering. He chaired the
UCIS director search commit-
tee.

Brustein said his priorities as
director will be to evaluate the
structure of UCIS; build on the
area studies programs to include
other regions of the world; de-
velop programs that reflect
transna-tional themes; expand
the Study Abroad program, and
develop fund—raising strategies.

“First I want to continue the
ﬁne work of Burkart I-Iolzner,”
Brustein said. “Pitt has an out-
standing reputation in interna-
tional studies and study-abroad
programs. There are many
strong points already in place at
Pitt including a commitment by
the Pittsburgh community. The
board of advisers, for example,
includes leaders in the corporate
ﬁelds, many of whom have inter-

. national connections.” -

Particularly noteworthy
Brustein said, is the National
Resource Center designation
enjoyed by the four UCIS area
studies programs, and the Euro-

4

 

pean Union Center, one of only
10 nationally, which is housed in
the Center for West European
Studies at UCIS. -

“I’d like to build the area stud-
ies focus into a strong global, or
what I like to call transnational,
perspective,” he said. “In today’s
world there are many themes
that cross national boundaries,
like genocide, for example. We
could also expand studies to cover
some other areas of the world,
includingthe Middle East and
Africa and the Indian subconti-
nent, by looking at issues in a
broad comparative perspective.
This could include building pro-
grams in areas not clustered in
regions. ,

“It won’t happen overnight,
but you publicize your programs,
you attract scholars and, eventu-
ally, you try for Title VI status,”
he said, referring to the Higher
Education Act under which the
U.S. Department of Education
authorizes National Resource
Center designation. .

“This does not mean you take
resources away from the area
studies programs that you have
already established; they are our
strength. But you can open them
up across the University. We
might eventually have transna-
tional programs, such as a cer-
tiﬁcate program in global stud-
ie5',’..". . .  . . I . ._ .

Regarding the structure of
UCIS, which coordinates inter-
national activities campus-wide,
Brustein said, “We are going to
look at it. It is always that way:
You can’t ever stand still, no
matter what, whether it’s at the
center level or even, in your own

research and teaching. We
should always be evaluating our-
selves. But we should not just
jettison the established model,
which, judging by what I know
so far, I like. And what I espe-
cially like is the full institutional
commitment to international
studies that I see at Pitt.”
Brustein said the ﬁrst step in
evaluating UCIS is to see how
the center fits into the
University’s institutional priori-
ties and overall strengths. “Then

you lool<.at_ whatis ..c_utt_i.ng-edge. .

in today’s world. By that I mean
emphasizing the transnational
and looking at expanding inter-
disciplinary possibilities, includ-
ing with Pitt’s professional
schools and the Honors Col-
lege.”

Brustein plans a new dimen--

sion for the Study Abroad pro-
gram. “You don’t throw out the
traditional model, which works
for many students: Go to a for-
eign country, live with a family
or in a dorm; go to the university’s
classes, learn the language and
the culture. Where our programs
have been failing, I think, is we
don’t involve our undergradu-
ates in what we as faculty do best,
which is research. We need to
get more students involved with
Pitt faculty who are doing out-
standing, leading research
around the world, and who could
beneﬁt from undergrads-work-
ingclosely under their supervi-
sion. The students, of course,

i beneﬁt as well.”

Brustein said he envisions
competitive funding opportuni-
ties offered in collaboration with
the Honors College to sponsor

student and faculty research ’

projects abroad.

The director-designate ac-
knowledged that he did not have
broad fund—raising experience.
“Mostly, I’m used to seeking fed-
eral funding and writing grant
proposals,” he said. “But I’m a
quick learner. I want to get to-
gether with the UCIS area stud-
ies directors and other leaders of
the center and the University
and talk about common issues
among them, including funding
sources. I also think foundations
are always looking for relevant

and useful things to fund; but

they’re also looking for excel-

lence, which UCIS has in abun-
dance.”

Brustein said the director of
UCIS is in a position to influ-

ence state educational policy. “I
have an abiding love for foreign

languages and their importance.
This country needs to model it-

self more on Europe as'far as

learning second languages and
exposure to other cultures. I
would hope state legislators and
educational policy-makers would

hear my arguments about that.”

Brustein earned a B.A. in po-
litical science at the University
of Connecticut, master’s degrees
in sociology at the University of
Washingtonand in international
studies atJohns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Stud-
ies, and a doctorate in sociology
at the University of Washington
in Seattle. '

,After serving on the sociol— -

ogy faculty at the University of
Utah from 1981 to 1988“,
Brustein was named assistant
professor in the sociology de-

partment at the University of ‘

Minnesota. He became an asso-
ciate professor in 1989 and pro-

ifessor in 1994. That year he also
was named adjunct professor in _

Minnesota’s Department of P0-
litical Science.

- Brustein was elected to the
Sociological Research Associa-

tion in 1996 and in 1998 was
« named a member of the National

Science Foundation Sociology
Panel, which advises the founda-
tion on which research projects
to fund.

His publications include
“The Logic of Evil: The Social
Origins of the Nazi.Party, 192 5 —
193 3,” which won the l997James

E S. Coleman Distinguished Con-

tribution to Rational—Choice
Scholarship from the American
Sociological Association, Ratio-
nal—Choice Section.

Brustein also received awards
for exceptional teaching while at
Utah and Minnesota. “I still love
teaching. I expect to eventually
work -my way back into it. But
I ’m not sure when. Certainly not
next spring when I ﬁrst arrive. I
need to get ‘up to speed ﬁrst on
being the director.”

_Asked his age, Brustein said,

i “I’m 52 -—' going on 28. I have a

lot of energy and enthusiasm for
this position and I can’t wait to
get started.”

Trial of plan for faculty evaluation

of department chairs set to be

I aculty would gain a
voice in evaluating the
job performances of

their department chairpersons,

«under a system proposed by a

University Senate task force.
The process would be similar
to the current student evalua-

tions.of teaching coordinated by
the Ofﬁce of Measurement and
Evaluation of Teaching. Sum-
maries of faculty evaluations (but

not the individual survey forms ’

ﬁlled out by faculty) would ‘be
forwarded to both deans and
chairpersons. ‘

University Senate vice presi-
dent Carol Redmond, who
chaired the task force that began

' studying the issue last fall, told

Senate Council members June
12: “We concluded that faculty
should have an opportunity to
assess the performance of de-

partment chairs, and that the
principle goal of the process
would be to provide deans with
faculty evaluations of the chairs’
performance which the deans
could then use as a component in
the annual evaluation of the
chairperson.’’ ,
Provost James Maher de-
scribed the proposal at the April
meeting of the Deans Council.
Deans of the engineering and
public health schools have agreed
to try out the system in their
schools during the 2000-2001

academic year. Other schools
also may participate in the pilot
tests, Redmond said, but the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
probably won’t be one of them.
“Some aspects of the system
require further discussion,” she
said. “For example, unlike most
other areas of the University,
thejappointment of chairs in F AS
is for speciﬁc‘terms,. usually no
more than three years. There-
fore, it’s likely the pilot test will
not proceed in FAS this year.”

conversation.” ‘

Locally, it was Pitt that, in
1993 , ﬁrst offered limited same-
sex employee beneﬁts, including
bereavement leave and ‘library
borrowing privileges, Norden-
berg pointed out.

“VVhen that happened, the
reactions of those opposed to
such beneﬁts were quite predict-
able,” the chancellor said. “That
is, there were some unhappy
donors. There were some un-
happy legislators. We took some

V lumps.

A “What was less predictable
was the reaction of those who
would have favored that step.

- And that is, we got sued. Because

even though we had taken a step
and even though we had taken it
earlier, we had not gone far
enough [according to those who

sued Pitt] . Over the course of the .

Medsger noted that leading U.S.

for same-sex health beneﬁts,” she
claimed.

The ACLU further said it
was unconstitutional to “deprive
[complainants] the ‘rights already
accruing to them prior to the
enactment of the 1999 Act on
which the‘ University re1ies.”
ACLU attorneys also chal-
lenged Gallo’s ruling that con-
tinuing the HRC proceedings

undertaken by the University to

The lawyers noted that, at
the time Pitt requested the pre-

ings were “on a hea'ring/resolu-

Civil War books
donated to UPB

The Hanley Library at the
Bradford campus and the Brad-
ford Area Public Library have
beneﬁted from a collection of

Civil War books.

Following Kenneth C..

-Heller’s death, his wife Maxine
donated his extensive collection
of Civil War books and materi-
als to the Hanley Library.

Trisha Morris, director of
Hanley Library, said: “We added
over 300 titles from the dona-
tion to our circulating collec-
tion. Had the library purchased
the books new, it would have
been over $4,000.”

Since some books were du-
plications of existing holdings,
the Hanley gave those to the
Bradford Area Public Library.

Heller spent his life amassing
the collection, his wife said. “We
used to take trips to Gettysburg
quite often, nearly once a year,”
she said. “He spent more than 30
years collecting those books. He
loved them. He’d be glad that

people are sharing his interest.”I

How the war changed the way

military

“The war in Korea formed a
bridge between the military-
media relationship of World
War II, during which coopera-
tion and a sense of shared'pur—
pose reigned, and that of the
Vietnam War, during which dis-
trust and hostility developed,”
said James Landers, a magazine
historian and former journalist.

At the start of the war, mili- .

tary commanders_ and journal-
ists cooperated to describe the
situation accurately, Landers
said. But their relationship soon
soured as U.S. and South Ko-
rean forces retreated before the
better-armed North Koreans —
and as criticisms of Gen. Dou-
glas MacArthur and other com-

manders by Gls and lower-rank-.

ing ofﬁcers appeared in Ameri-
can newspapers, newsmagazines
and radio reports.

“In the space of ﬁve months,
journalists in Korea went from
reporting with no censorship, to
reportingwith voluntary censor-
ship, to reporting with full ﬁeld
censorship,” Landers said. “Mili—

. tary commanders justiﬁed the

progressive restrictions on the
basis of operational security,
while journalists believed the
military sought mainly to pro-
tect its public image.”

Generals who had experi-
enced only positive reporting
during World War II were sur-
prised, then angered, as journal-
ists began reporting casualty rates
for speciﬁc units and portraying
American soldiers as ‘being
frightened, bewildered and de-
moralized, said Landers. “Some
of the descriptions were unlike

conﬂicts are reported

any published during World War
II, when journalists avoided deal-
ing with the emotional toll of
battle and the psychological
trauma that resulted.

“Also, photographs focused
more on the aftermath of com-
bat in Korea than in the previous
war, when concern for troop
morale and public reaction had
kept editors and photographers
from considering pictures of men
crying orotherwise distraught,”
Landers said. _

New, more sophisticated
lenses and ﬁlm processing, the
knowledge that good photos
boosted sales, and competition
from a new medium — televi-
sion—— led newspapers and maga-
zines to publish more dramatic
images, hesaid. (Fewer than 10
percent ofU.S. homes had a tele-
vision set at the war’s beginning
in 1950. Bywar’s end in 1953, 40
percent had a TV.)

Infuriated by negative cover-
age, Maclxrthur ordered man-
datory censorship to begin in
December 195 0. The system was
largely effective, Landers said,
because journalists in Korea had
to dictate their copy by telephone

. to ofﬁces in Japan, from which

the text would be radioed to the

i United States.
The U.S. Army Signal Corps ’

operated the only telephone sys-
tem connecting Korea to Japan,
so the Army could delete any

information it wanted, Landers

said —- although, he added, some
journalists would fly to Tokyo
and then deliver their text to a
colleague traveling to the United
States, where it would be pub-

lished.

“Censorship remained in ef-
fect until the armistice in July
195 3,” Landers noted.

The skepticism that journal-
ists acquired in Korea of U.S.
military leaders’ motives would

come back to haunt the generals .
.in Vietnam, he said. Battleﬁeld

conditions and new communi-
cation technologies virtually
ruled out censorship during the
Vietnam War.
Journalists
“would overwhelmingly comply
with restrictions necessitated by
operational security concerns but
would ‘adamantly resist any at-
tempts to prevent reporting of

information related to-t1;oop«V

morale, combat conditions", or

other subjects not considered

potentially harmful to combat-
ants,” Landers said. _
In U.S. military operations

. since Vietnam, the military has

reasserted a large measure of
control over reports from the
ﬁeld, said Landers and Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette reporter
Bob Dvorak, who was a combat
pool reporter for the Associated
Press during Operation Desert
Storm. ,
‘ Unlike Vietnam War report-
ers, who traveled freely to inter-
view soldiers, visit combat sites
and transmit copy, journalists in
the Persian Gulf were forced to
depend on the military to reach
otherwise inaccessible desert
battleﬁelds.
Dvorak recalled covering epic
tank battles in whi_ch U.S. forces
were killing Iraqis from three

miles away, while sandstorms V

reduced visibility to 1,000 yards.
In such a war, “the closest seat is
not necessarily the best,” Dvorak

quipped.

Gallant allies: The story

of the Turkish Brigade

:Arnong the Virtually forgot-
ten combatants in the “forgot-
ten war” were the 25,000 Turk-
ish soldiers who served in Korea.

Fighting in the U.N.’s ﬁrst
police action earned the con-
script Turkish Brigade a reputa-
tion for extraordinary valor (at a
cost of 3,277 casualties) and
speeded admission of Turkey
into NATO, said Fusun
Turkmen of Istanbul’s
Galatasary University.

On a deeper level, she said,
the Korean War furthered
Turkeyfs,“socio—psycho-histori-
cal quest_ for Western identity”
—— a quest that continues today
as Turkey seeks membership in
the -European Union. .

In the aftermath of World
War II, Turkey’s greatest for-
eign policy problem was the
country’s isolation, Turkmen
said. “Drained by two massive
wars —- World, War I and the

ensuing war of independence —‘

and in the process of building a
young republic on the vestiges
of the defunct Ottoman Empire,
[Turkey] had refrained through-

out World War II from being —

dragged into hostilities, espe-

' cially since she had not been at-

tacked this time.”
After the war, the interna-
tional community viewed Tur-

key as a neutral country. “That.

made her particularly vulnerable
in the eyes of the Soviet
Union. . .still eager to control the

Black Sea straits,” Turkmen said. '

Threatened by.Soviet de-
mands to share in administering
the strategic waterway, Turkey
sought closer ties with the United
States. _ i

Truman administration ofﬁ—'
cials, meanwhile, had concluded
byJanuary 1946 thatlthe Soviets
would attackTurkey unless faced
with strong U.S. resistance, said
Turkmen.

A symbolic gesture cemented-
the bond between Turkey and.
the United States, she recounted.

VVhen Turkish Ambassador
Miinir Ertegin died in 0 Wash-

ington in April 1946, President A
-Truman dispatched the U.S.

battleship Missouri to return his
body to Turkey. “Reaction in
Turkey was so ecstatic that since
then, some experts refer to the
Missouri episode as the begin-
ning of the love affair between
Turkey and the U.S.A.,”
Turkmen said.

VVith the declaration of the
Truman Doctrine the following
year, the United States began
providing massive economic and
military aid to Turkey and-
Greece.

Less than a month after
Turkey’s first democratically
elected government took power,
the Korean War broke, out. In
response to I a U.N. plea for
troops, the government sent a
5 ,000-man brigade — despite the
risk of Soviet retaliation, and
without demanding Turkey’s
eventual admission to NATO as
a condition, Turkmen said. ,

Although they had never
fought away from home before,
Turkish troops entered the con-
flict with style, charging uphill
with ﬁxed bayonets to push back
a Chinese advance at the Battle
ofWavon on Nov. 28, 1950. For

the next three days, the Turkish ~

Brigade helped to hold off Chi-
nese troops long enough for the
U.S. Eighth Army to retreat
safely. U.N. commanders would
credit the Turks with saving the
Eighth Army from destruction,
Turkmen noted. e _

The Chicago Tribune re-
ported the news under the head-
line, “Turks could be our best
allies.” A commentator for the
Soviet TASS news agency icily
addressed American troops:
“This time, it was the Turks who
saved you!”

Korean War veterans at last .

cious and dependable of

“Because of what ym
what happened to so

5 North and South Korean leaders held historic reconcilia-

tion talks last week, military historians from across North

America oined local academicians and Korean War veterans
at Pitt for a “History of the Korean War” conference. e

Presenters discussed the war’s origins and legacy, forgotten partici-
pants in the__“forgotten war” such as Turkish troops,’wartime relations
between military authorities and the press, and myths that have arisen in
the 47 years since the armistice. (T he war hasn’t formally ended yet, and
37,000 U.S. troops remain stationed in South Korea —— a token force that
serves as a “trip wire” against invasion but could not itself ﬁght off a
North Korean onslaught, presenters said.) I

The emotional high point of the June 15 & 16 conference came on
the second ‘afternoon, with an address by Washington state Sen. Paull H.
Shin, an alumnus of Pitt’s Graduate School of Public andlnternational
Affairs. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Shin was a 15-year-
old orphan, begging food to stay alive. “I had never had a home-cooked
meal. I had never gone to school,” he recalled. Shin ﬂed Seoul when the
Communists invaded, but returned after Gen. MacArthur landed at

. Inchon and reoccupied the southern capital. ,

For a while, Shin survived‘ on handouts from American GIs passing
by in truck convoys. “One day, I went out as usual, asking for handouts,”
Shin said. “One of the soldiers, who was unknown to me, raised his hand
to me. I thought he was giving me candy. But instead, when I reached my
hand to him, he grabbed me and lifted me up in his truck.

“Little did I know, he’ would later become my saviour.”

Shin got a job as a houseboy for GIs in the front lines. “I would watch
them head out every morning. Some of them wouldn’t come back. Some i
came back missing arms or legs. At night, I used to hear them crying,
praying for safety.” » I

Seasonal conditions ranged from mud to choking dust to subzero
cold, ‘ with the spectre of violent death never far away, Shin said.
Conditions were even crueler for Allied prisoners of war, as Shin learned
in later years by interviewing surviving POWS for a book he’s writing.

ttdid, look       a
many of as today.”

Because of the Allies’ overwhelming air supremacy, Chinese and North
Korean forces maintained only the most makeshift POW camps; in any
case, they did not honor the Geneva conventions on humane treatment
of POWS. Prisoners were marched from place to place, with many dying
of exhaustion, exposure and, all too often, friendly ﬁre from U.S.
bombers, Shin said. .
Shin himself was lucky. The GI,who had lifted him into his truck in
~ 1951 —— a Mr. Paull —— adopted Shin and brought him to the United
States after the war-. Shin took the man’s surname as his own ﬁrst name.

At age 18, Shin enrolled in school for the first time in his life. “I began
by learning my ABCS. Then, I got my G.E.D. Finally, I got my Ph.D.”

Addressing the white—haired Korean War veterans in the audience —
some of them still with straight-backed, military postures, a few stooped

’ and frail-looking — the bespectacled Shin, now a grandfather, fought
back tears to say: “I was a little boy. I watched you folks come to my
country as young men, even to sacriﬁce your own lives. Because of what
you did, look what happened to so many of us today.

“Thank you.” ’

Shin retired after a 31-year college teaching career to enter politics.
He was elected to Washington’s House and then to its Senate, making
him the highest-ranking U.S. elected ofﬁcial of Korean descent. The
South Korean ‘government invited‘him back to his native country two
years ago to celebrate the accomplishment. .

“When I arrived at the [Seoul] airport, I was met by the prime
minister, Congresspersons, radio and TV reporters,” Shin recalled.

“Toward the end of the meeting, the press asked me, ‘Dr. Shin, in
your district, are the constituents mostly Asians?’ I said, ‘No.’

“They said, ‘VVho are they?’ I said, ‘About 96 percent are white
Americans and 4 percent are minorities.’ The reporters said, ‘And they
voted for you? How could they vote for you?’

“I said, ‘That’s a living testimony that American democracy really
works.’” . -

Joanne Bartone/C/DDE ~

popular myth

OnJan. 12, 1950, U.S. Secre-

tary of State Dean Acheson de— ’
. livered a famous speech at the

National Press Club in which he
failed to include South Korea in
America’s defense perimeter in
the Paciﬁc.

, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower,
campaigning in the 1952 presi-
dential election, charged that
Acheson’s‘ omission “gaye the
green light” to a North Korean
invasion because itconvinced the
Communists that America would
not defend the south.

Historians and military ana-
lysts would debate the ~charge’s
merits,» but a public consensus
emerged that the Truman ad-
ministration had bungled-by sig-
naling North Korea, China and
the Soviet Union that the United
States considered South Korea
to be expendable. J _

_ However, recently declassi-
ﬁed Soviet documents and Chi-
nese documents available prior
to l989’s Tiananmen Square
indicate that
Acheson’s address “had little if
any impact on Communist de-
liberations,” said James Matray,
professor of history at New
Mexico State University.

Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin
“worried about U.S. military in-
tervention until the moment the

.Korean War began,” Matray

said. “Moreover, he feared that
North Korea could not survive
an attack ‘that he was certain
South Korea would stage in the
future; His approval of [North
Korean leader]'Kim Il Sung’s
plan was amistake, but it derived
from a sense of weakness rather
than strength.”

’ Acheson’s speech was, in fact,
a judicious statement that enun-
ciated Truman’s emphasis on
economic assistance in Asia
rather than military power, ac-
cording to Matray. “Outlining
the U.S. ‘defensive perimeter’

‘_was as secondary issue in

Acheson’s speech that reflected’,
in part, concern that President
Syngman Rhee of South Korea
might resort to military aggres-
sion against the north to achieve
reuniﬁcation. The secretary of
state was attempting to caution
the South Koreans that the
United States would not guar-
antee absolutely [South-Korea’s]

military security,” Matray said.

Acheson was outraged at be-

ing blamed for the war. He hadn’t V
speciﬁcally included Australia or

New Zealand in America’s Pa-
ciﬁc defense perimeter either,
he pointed out in his memoirs,
yet no one could have doubted
the West’s commitment to those
countries. The United States’
ﬁrst Asian mutual defense agree-

’ment had been with South Ko-

rea, something that the Com-
munists could not have over-
looked, Acheson wrote.
Acheson’s Press Club speech
isn’t even mentioned in Soviet
documents, Matray found in his
research. Instead, the volumi-
nous memos, letters and cables
show how cleverly North Korea’s
dictator played his mutually an-
tagonistic allies, Stalin and Mao
Zedong, off each other, Matray
said. “Kim Il Sung displayed re-
markable political talent, as he
manipulated his patrons into sup-

Historians debunk some
5 about the war

porting his plan for invasion. He
was able to persuade Stalin and
Mao that his forces would achieve
victory before the United States
could intervene, not because the
Americans would not act to save
South Korea.’’
a Cl

Stanley Sandler, recently ‘a
chaired professor at Virginia
Military Institute, detailed other
Korean War myths in his pre-
sentation, including the follow-
ing: ~ '
° U.N. forces fought “with one
arm tied hehind their hacks” —— a
comforting myth to generals in

the Korean as well as Vietnam

conﬂicts, Sandler said.

Indeed, U.N airpower was of-
ﬁcially restricted to the Korean
side of the Yalu’ River border
with China and the Tyumen
River border with the U.S.S.R.
But Communists planes rarely
ventured south of Pyongyang,
well north of the 38th parallel,
Sandler said.

“Joseph Stalin was as deter-
mined as Harry Truman to con-
ﬁne the Korean War to Korea,
and Stalin faced considerably
more provocation than did the
American president,” Sandler
said. For example, in October
1950, U.S. jet ﬁghters penetrated
20 miles into Soviet air space and
shot up a Red Air Force base.
“The Soviet government made
the expected strong protests, the
Americans expressed their re-
grets, paid compensation, and

the incident was closed,” said.

Sandler— wondering aloud how
the United States‘ would have
responded if Soviet forces, ﬁght-
ing a war with Canada, had
strayed across our border and
attacked New York’s Rome Air
Force Base.

° The United States engaged in
bacteriological warfare.

It’s true that America was test-'
ing bacteriological weapons in
the 19505, with a “criminally ir-
responsible” disregard for safety

‘by today’s standards, Sandler

said. And the United States had
“shamelessly and uselessly” co-
operated with the commander
of a secret Japanese chemical-
biological warfare research unit
that had experimented on Allied

POWS and Chinese civilians.‘

during World War II, he added.
“The United States was thus
at some disadvantage in its flat-

out denials” of employing ’bio- ‘

logical warfare in Korea, Sandler
stated.

But according to Sandler,
declassiﬁed Soviet security forces
memos indicate that the North
Koreans obtained plague and
cholera bacteria from Chinese
corpses and created false “infec—
tion regions” to be found by in-
spectors from international pro-
peace organizations. Communist
prisoners awaiting execution
were purposely infected, then
poisoned, so their bodies could
be found. -

In a secret May 195 3 resolu-
tion, Soviet leaders rebuked Mao
Zedong for having misled the
U.S.S.R.: “The spread in the
press of information about the
use by the Americans of bacte-
riological weapons in Korea was
based on false information,” the

JUNE 22, 2000

Kremlin complained. “The ac-
cusations against the Americans
were ﬁctitious.”

These and other documents
provide only fragmentary’ evi-
dence against U.S. use of bio-
logical warfare — but it’s a lot
more substantial than the con-
trary evidence, Sandler said.

0 Communist MiG jet ﬁghters
that dueled with U.N. forces were
ﬂown hy Chinese pilots.

Some 67,000 Soviet air and
ground personnel served in
North, Korea, Sandler ‘noted.
Stalin was so anxious to protect
this “secret” (widely, known
among U.N. forces) that he or-
dered his pilots to wear Chinese
uniforms and transmit in Chi-
nese —— “the latter anobviously
impossible requirement,”
Sandler said.

Sandler concluded: While the A

United States could freely bomb
a fraternal ally of the U.S.S.R.
and intrude on Soviet territory,
Stalin feared that Americans
might be provoked to nuke his
country if it became known that
Red Air Force pilots were flying
MiGs inthe war.

0 Communist “hordes ”over—ran
U.N. forces early in the war.

The Communists enjoyed
overwhelming numerical supe-

riority only in the opening stage I

of the conﬂict and during the
initial incursion of the Chinese,
Sandler said. U.S. and Korean
forces actually outnumbered
their enemy 2:1 during the des-
perate ﬁghting in 1950 around
the Pusan Perimeter, in which
more Americans died than at any
other time. in the wa"r,.Sandler
said.

Surprise, better discipline and
superior weaponry (particularly
the Russian T-34 tank, against
which the Allies had no defense)
gave the North Koreans the ad-
vantage in the war’s early stages,
according to Sandler.

° Mac/Irthurlshehind—the—lz'nes
Inchon lan/ding was a “desperate
gamhle.” .

MacArthur played up this
myth, but the main problem that
U.N. forces faced was the enor-
mous tidal reach of the Inchon
waterway, Sandler said.

“If MacArthur’s planners
didn’t get it exactly right, the
U.N. invasion fleet would be left
stranded on the mud ﬂats, sit-
ting ducks,” he noted. “But sit-

“ ting ducks to what? The Korean

People’s Air Force had been
pretty much shot out of the sky
by then, and the invasion ar-
mada contained several aircraft
carriers and their crack pilots.
The stranding of an invasion fleet
would have been a major embar-
rassment, certainly, but nothing
remotely like a disaster.”

°.MacArthur’s march to the
Yalu River triggered Chinese in-
tervention,

The Chinese were planning
to intervene long before U.S.
forces reached the Yalu, declas-
siﬁed documents show. “The
famous indirect warnings to the
Americans by Foreign Minister
Chou En Lai against approach-
ing the Yalu seems now to have
been merely a means to justify a
course already determined upon
by the Chinese,” Sandler said.

CO -soluble
maaterial
developed by
engineering
researchers

Pitt researchers have devel-
oped a highly carbon dioxide
(CO )—soluble material that is
much less expensive than previ-
ous versions. .

This new material could be
used as building blocks for prod-
ucts such as CO,-soluble soaps,
metal-binding agents, and addi-
tives for enhanced oil recovery.

Further, researchers believe
that the method they used to
create the new poly(ether-car-
bonate) copolymers holds prom-
ise for creating similar com-
pounds that will open the door
for CO, to be used in a variety of
manufacturing processes.

“Carbon ‘dioxide is consid-
ered an environmentally benign
solvent, but it is also rather
feeble,” said Eric Beckman, pro-
fessor of chemical engineering
at Pitt. “In order to dissolve even
small amounts of many com-
pounds, such as metals and pro-
teins, very high CO, pressures
are often needed, which makes
CO -based processing prohibi-
tively expensive.”

To capitalize on the poten-
tial of carbon dioxide as a sol-
vent, many ‘researchers turned
to fluorocarbons, which, though
highly CO,—soluble, are prohibi-
tively expensive to use in indus-
try if they cannot be recycled
efficiently.

RESEARCH NOTES

fessor of pathology and surgery
at Pitt’s Thomas E. Starzl Trans-
plantation Institute.

Using a polymerase chain
reaction method that detects the
unique proﬁles of genes, 81 heart
recipients, 29 organ donors and
50 control patients were
cytokine—genotyped. Cytokines
are hormone-like substances that
cells use to communicate with
each other and that modulate
immune activity.

‘Those recipients who had
multiple acute rejection episodes
— referred to as rejecters —- had
a markedly different proﬁle of
cytokine genes (lower levels of
Interleukin-10, or IL-1-0) than
did those who experienced few
episodes (higher levels of IL-10
and low levels of Tumor N CCI‘O-
sis Factor-alpha, or TNF-a).
Donor cytokine genotype had
little correlation with rates of
rejection.

Because the screening may
prove useful as a predictor factor
for the frequency of rejection,
Zeevi’s colleagues plan to evalu-
ate its value in a protocol that
involves weaning patients off
immunosuppression. Typically,
transplant patients are required
to take anti—rejection drugs for
the rest oftheir lives. Such drugs
can cause serious complications,
such as tumor growth, and make
patients more susceptible to in-
fections. ,

In another study, George
Mazariegos, assistant professor
of surgery at the Starzl Trans-
plantation Institute, reported

,that nearly athird of the 120 , 
‘patients’ enrolled ' in the physi-

cian—controlled protocol have
been completely weaned. Wean-

' ing was stopped in another third

who experienced acute rejection.
“VVhile these cases were_suc-
cessfully treated, usually by re-
instating their previous levels of
immune suppression with or‘

without steroid therapy, and no

grafts were lost, it would be ex-
tremely helpful to be able to pre-
dict in advance which patients

we can successfully wean,”'

Mazariegos said.

Brain center
gets $6 million
renewal grant
The University of Pittsburgh
Brain Trauma Research Center
has been awarded a $6 million
grant from the National Insti-
tutes of Health’s National Insti-
tute of Neurological Disorders

‘and Stroke to continue research

in the treatment of traumatic

. brain injuries.

The ﬁve—year grant allows‘
investigators to research the
causes of brain swelling follow-
ing head injury, why some head
injury patients experience a poor
outcome and the role that drugs
play _in treating brain injury.

“This renewal grant permits
us to continue our investigations
of basic molecular mechanisms
responsible for secondary brain
injury, and to identify new medi-
cations that will improve out-'
comes. We are focusing on the
causes of brain swelling soon af-
ter injury. Brain swelling is the
most important cause of death
and disability following trau-
matic brain injury,” said Donald
W. .Marion, professor and in-
terim chief of the neurosurgical

service in Pitt’s neurological sur-
gery department, and director
and founder of the Brain Trauma
Research Center.

The centeris one of only three '

National Institutes of Health-

designated head injury centers _

in the United States. It is closely
allied with the University’s Cen-
ter for Injury Research and Con-
trol (CIRCL), also directed by
Marion, and the "Safar Center
for Resuscitation Research, di-
rected by Patrick Kochanek.
In the United States, trau-
matic brain injury is‘the most
common cause of death, disabil-
ity and mental impairment in
people between 1 and 45, affect-
ing an estimated two million
people each year. Because trauma
disproportionately affects

younger individuals, it accounts

for more years of potential life
loss than cancer and cardiovas-
cular diséase combined.
Annually, 50,000 people suf-
fer severe brain injuries and re-
quire long-term care at a cost of
more than $20 billion, accord-
ing to the National Institute of

studies on the effects of lead ex-

posure on children that were in- _-
strumental in nationwide gav-

ernment bans on lead from paint,

gasoline and food and beverage

cans, examined 216 youths con-
victed in the Juvenile Court of
Allegheny County and 201 non-
delinquent controls from high
schools in Pittsburgh.

Bone lead levels,_ measured
by K X-ray ﬂuorescence spec-
troscopy of the tibi.a,~showed that
the delinquent youths had sig-
niﬁcantly higher mean concen-
trations of lead in their bones —

B _13.7 parts per million (pm) —

compared to the control group.
Those results were true for both
whites and African Americans
and males and females.

“This study provides further

evidence that delinquent behav- I

ior can be caused, in part,‘by
childhood exposure to lead,”
Needleman said. “Of all the

causes of juvenile delinquency,

lead exposure is perhaps the most-

preventable. These results,

should be a call to action for

legislators to protect our chil- :
dren by requiring landlords to c-

not simply disclose known in-

stances of lead paint in their prop- S

erties, but to remove it.”

While this study is the ﬁrst to
show thatlead exposure is higher
in arrested delinquents, it is part
of a_ growing body of evidence
linking lead to cognitive and be-
havioral problems in children.
In 1996, N eedleman published a
study of 300 boys in Pittsburgh
public schools and found that

those with relatively high levels I.

of lead in their bones were more
likely to ‘engage in antisocial ac-
tivities like bullying, vandalism,

Needle:;gan,_;;._-.
‘known for his groundbreaking”

- truancy and shoplifting. In 1979,

Needleman, using measure-
ments of lead in children’s teeth,
concluded that children with

‘high lead levels in their teeth,

but no outward signs_of lead poi-
soning, had lower IQ scores,

shorter attention spans and.

poorer language. skills.
The results of Needleman’s
latest study were presented last

» month.

- UPMC Presbyterian is one

undergoing cardiac bypass sur-
8e1'Y- ,
The multi-center~research
study is a phase III trial of
Oxygent, which was developed

by Alliance Pharmaceutical ’

Corp. as a means to reduce or
eliminate the need for donor
blood transfusions during sur-
gery or other periods of acute
oxygen deﬁcit. UPMC was one
of the ‘ﬁrst to enroll -patientsinto
the international trial, the re-
sults .-ref, w11i,Ch:  
possible U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval. .
'“We,are happy to participate
in_ this trial because’ clearly, an
alternative source of blood is
needed,” said Bartley P.
Grifﬁth, Henry Bahnson Pro-
fessor of Surgery and chief, divi-
sion of cardiothoracic surgery at

‘Pitt’s School of Medicine, and

the principal investigator for the
Pittsburgh site. _
Each year, more than 4 mil-
lion patients in the United States
require 1-4 units of donor blood
during surgeries, totaling about
11 million units. Increasingly,»
elective surgeries are being can-
celled or postponed because of

I shortages of donor blood. And

while sophisticated screening
measures are routine, they can
increase the cost of obtaining
donor blood and do not guaran-
tee the safety of the supply.

A phase II trial involving more
than 250 patients provided pre-
liminary evidence of the safety
of Oxygent and that it may be
more effective in improving oxy-
genation within the body than a
unit of fresh blood. The..,phase
III trial will enroll 600 patients.

Oxygent looks like milk and
contains no blood or blood prod-
ucts. Unlike donor blood, which
has a shelf—life of about six weeks,
Oxygent can be stored for about
two years and can be used for
patients of all blood types.
Oxygent is a perﬂubron emul-
sion that picks up oxygen from
the lungs and carries it through
the blood stream.

called HemoMax, developed by
Pitt’s McGowan Center for Ar-
tiﬁcial Organ Development, is
