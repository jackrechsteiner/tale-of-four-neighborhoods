“ Staff Writer . "

Would you like to be making $200,000
by your 26tl1 birthday? How about spending
only four months out of the year actually
working? If ‘so, you may want to consider
being a Liberty Tax entrepreneur, like
Pittsburghers Markques McKnight and TJ.
Tement. ’

and they don’t hesitate to mention that the.
“right attitude” is what Liberty really wants
in an entrepreneur.

McKnight said the attitude is “being.
committed to being successful.” He recited
Liberty’s motto of “set the standard, improve
each day, and have fun.” . ,. '

Although his new job might be difficult,

‘said McKnight, “no one is standing around

saying it  to be boring.”
A To promote his business,

Liberty Tax H Service,

franchises, recruits recent
graduates — those who
have graduated in the last
three to ﬁve years ——_— as
owners of their franchises.

Not only are good
grades not required, but

$25,000 to $50,000 that
Liberty provides to start up '
their entrepreneur hopefuls
— even if they decide the
position is not for them.’

After that, they will have to ﬁgure out what
to do with their $75,000, which, according to
Liberty’s C.E.O. John Hewitt, is what entre-
preneurs can plan on making their ﬁrst year.

Grades don’t factor into Liberty’s
choice of owners, but the right attitude -does.
Those who are ambitious, honest and willing
to take a risk are chosen.

Hewitt said that grades don’t always
show how successful people are. Instead, he
looks at other accomplishments. If candi-
dates have owned their own paper routes or
were leaders in a student organization, they _
are more likely to be chosen.

munity,” Higgins said, adding that straight membersidf

LGBTQ organizations and gay—straight alliances are some-

times refened to as  . _
Some straight members, as well as many people who

have not yet’come out as a part of what Higgins described as A

the “sexual-minority,” are active in the group, she said

“Obviously, we don’t ask them to check their sexual
identities at the door,” she added.

Addressing the term “queer,” which once seemed to
carry a negative stigma when applied to the LGBTQ com-
munity, Higgins said it is now an acceptable way to describe
“everybody who falls in the sexual minority.”

“We’re reclaiming the term,” Rabatin added. “It’s not a
taboo word anymore, when you’re describing the culture or
the community.” ,

But straight students aren’t the only ones who might
misunderstand the group, Rabatin said.

“I think a lot of people are intimidated,” Rabatin said.
‘They think if they’re still in the closet, we’re going to shove
them out” '

“We work so hard to make it an anonymous organiza-
tion,” Higgins added. “We all remember what it was like to
be coming out.”

Higgins explained that the group does not release mem-
bers’ names without their permission, and that those attend-
ing meetings are welcome to withhold their real names.

“We also get the stereotype that all of us are ridiculous,
feminine, white men who parade around in high heels,”
Higgins said, pointing out that she clearly did not ﬁt the
stereotype.

, Rabatin explained that the City of Pittsburgh passed the
Equal Rights Ordinance, which declared that no organization
could  based on sexual orientation.

Shortly thereafter, Carnegie Mellon University began
granting} domestic partner beneﬁts to employees, Rabatin
added. -,

In January of this year, Pitt challenged the ordinance,
proposing thatit is unconstitutional for a city, instead of a
state, to pass a civil rights ordinance. . I

But Rabatin and Higgins said that more than just sarne-
sex beneﬁts are at stake if the ordinance is repealed.

“It’s basically saying that they can discriminate if they
want to,” Rabatin said.

“The landlord could say, ‘I don’t think you’re of moral
standing to live in my apartment,”’ Rabatin added, explain-
ing that he could not take any legal action against such dis-
crimination if the ordinance was repealed. “I could be home-
less because of the fact [that] I’m gay.”

Sarne-sex beneﬁts aside, Higgins said that Pitt general-
ly supports the group’s existence, and that the group enjoys
the beneﬁts of being a Pitt organization. '

But she added that the University also beneﬁts from the
group’s presence.

“Because Pitt has a,Rainbow Alliance, they can adver-

‘ tise that they’re LGBTQ—friend1y,” Higgins said.

She explained that, last year, the group sought to add to
the roommate survey that all freshmen ﬁll out a question
regarding attitude toward sexuality. Such a question, she
said, would help prevent LGBTQ students from being
placed with roommates who might not respond well to their
sexual orientations. _

“You can’t really write your roommate and say, ‘Hey,
I’m gay, are you going to have a problem with that?’” she
said. “We run into people who have had terrible things hap-
pen to them.” ’

The proposal, she added, has not gotten very far.

“I think the~University climate is changing, but I don’t
think We’re all the way there yet,” she said.

Support from the student population, Rabatin added, is
often quite positive. I

“.‘I’ve had people come up and say, ‘Hey, I’d like to get

involved,” Rabatin said.

Rainbow-members just got through a number of activi-
ties organized for “National Coming Out Week,” but they’re
already looking ahead to World AIDS Week in December.

Members of Rainbow Alliance will hand out in Towers
lobby what Rabatin described as “bags and bags and bags of
condoms” donated by the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, as
well as irrformation about AIDS statistics and testing,
throughout the week i - ’

Group members will also help plan and participate in an
AIDS vigil on Dec. 1 on the lawn in front of Heinz Chapel.
The event, for which Higgins said she would do a reading,
will offer a memorial for people who have died of AIDS. The
vigil will also include a religious aspect, she said, adding that
religious leaders from the area will be present.

Rainbow Alliance meets every other Thursday. They

will meet this Thursday, which will be “Bring a Friend” H

Workers searchjfor Iraqi teachers

tion working with the U.S. Agency for
International Development for the
reconstruction of the secondary educa-
tion system — junior and senior high
schools — in Iraq.

The U.S. Agency for International
Development is a U.S. government
“umbrella” contracting group that over-'
sees the rebuilding of various Iraqi
national infrastructures

Dall, along with his ground. team. of ‘

150 nationals and 40 Iraqi expatriates,

 has been confronted with the once—high-

ly functional Iraqi education system that,
since the first Gulf War, has atrophied as
resources to pay teachers and maintain
schools were diverted by the govem-
ment of Saddam Hussein. .
“After this most recent conﬂict, the
education system went down even fur-
ther, or ground to a complete halt,’«’ Dall
said; “Ministries were bombed and loot-
ed, schools were destroyed, and children
were pulled out of any that remained.”

“security shield”» of coalition—guarded
urban areas and, at great physical risk,
scouring the length and breadth of the
various regions of the country to ﬁnd
schools, teachers and administrators,
from whom they could ﬁnd out what the
situation was and what they needed to
operate once more.

Dall had previously worked for
seven years before the war in Amman,
Jordan, as UNICEF’s senior education
ofﬁcer for the Middle East region. He
frequently dealt with Iraq’s Ministry of

‘ Education, and he said he was all too

familiar with what they might discover.
What they found were many empty
school buildings where looters had taken
and sold everything, from desks to the
wiring in the walls. They also found
many teachers and administrators who
were trying to make ends meet after
years of earning next to nothing for their

efforts, as well as students who had no ’

learning materials or places to go to
school. ‘

The infrastructure ‘would have to be
repaired, he said, but workers could
avoid the much higher costs of time and
effort required by “starting from
scratc ,” as leaders are currently doing
in places like Afghanistan, where there is
no precedent of a quality national educa-
tion system at all. .

education system in Iraq.
Aguilar stressed that, in countries in

gconﬂict, psychological ramifications

affect children who were indoctrinated
into cultures of violence. She said such
effects had to be taken into account in
education reconstruction efforts.

“How do you reconstruct the think-
ing of a child who, since the age of 7
years old, has had a machine gun in their‘
hand?” said Aguilar.

“You must have safe and healing

and he gave some sug-
gestions of how to
establish a long-terin, quality Iraqi edu-
cation system. . .

Method said that a focus on the

strengthening of infrastructure is the key‘

to creating any kind of a long—term, self-
sufficient Iraqi education system.

“It is not about paying teachers, but
about how you pay them when there are
no banking systems,” Method said.

He suggested the establishment of
national standardized exams with certi-
ﬁed committees to maintain their quali-
ty, a mobilization of resources to put
government education expenditures at
an average level of at least 25 to 30 per-
cent, and the continuation of traditional
Iraqi educational inclusion — relative to
the inclusion in some neighboring Arab
countries ——- of women as students and
teachers. ,

Method said such measures would
play a major role, not only in maintain-
ing the quality of the education system,
but in providing a symbolic’ national.val-
idation for an Iraqi government whose
country is under constant threat of dis-
solving along ethnic and religious lines.

Pilar Aguilar, who is a senior‘

research associate with UNICEF, was
the ﬁnal panelist of the lecture. Her orga-
nization, along with the Japanese devel-
opmental organization Japan
Intemational Cooperation Agency, has

heart of the Iraqi capital
of Baghdad. According
to a rriilitary coalition spokesperson, the
rocket attack killed one person and
injured 15 others, including 11 civilians.

During the question and answer por-
tion of the lecture, one member of the
audience touched on other long-term
challenges by asking. the panel how
much of a role they thought AIDS,
which is widespread ‘in Africa, would
play in the stability of an emerging Iraqi
nation.

Dall responded that a 2001, UNICEF
study, in which he participated, indicated
that, of the 270 million people living in
“Arab world” countries, about 400,000
people were infected with AIDS. The
“Arab world,” defined by the survey,
stretched from Morocco in the west to
Iran in the’ east. 1

Dall added that the total number of
cases could be 10 times as many, due to
the social stigma of publicly reporting
infection by the disease.

Infected Kuwaitis must ﬂee their
country for expensive treatment in
Europe out of fear of persecution, Dall
said. A largely conservative regional
mindset, “porous” national borders
allowing infected foreigners, and expen-
sive testing methods all played roles in
what he described as a growing regional
pandemic that calls for strong health and
education measures;

Pa. right to sue over new clean-air rules

of car exhaust and the slight tang of
ozone.

While some might complain about
Pittsburgh’s air quality — sixth worst in
the country, according to the hotly con-
tested Surface Transportation Policy
Project — the city has improved air qual-
ity and is no longer the “Smoky City” it
once was.

And we should keep on this track.

Pennsylvania, along with 11 other
states, a few cities and a coalition of envi-
ronmental organizations, filed a lawsuit
to reverse the changes to the Clean Air
Act that were finalized Oct. 27, accord-
ing to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Originally, the Clean Air Act man-
dated that major polluters — factories,
power plants, anything that spews a great
deal of smoke — clean up their act or
face sizable ﬁnes. Exceptions were made
for polluters with older facilities, grand-
fathering them so that they didn’t have to
change immediately. Instead, they could
implement these changes when they
modernized their factories.

The new rules state that, should the
modemizations cost less than 20 percent
of what a new facility would, the new
equipment doesn’t have to meet clean air
standards. These facilities are, in essence,
grandfathered ad nauseum —— until the
pollution actually makes us nauseous,
asthmatic and diseased, that is.

The Environmental Protection
Agency signed off on these rule changes
-—— did no one tell them what “protection”
means?

Protecting the environment should
be about sewing “up these loopholes.
About 540 power plants, which provide
about 51 percent of the nation’s power,
would qualify as grandfathered.

The riﬂes previously in place worked
— Pittsburgh may still have poor air
quality, but there’s less pollution than
there was. People no longer practice the
uniquely Pittsburgh custom of changing
their shirts midday because of soot.

To top off this smog—o-riﬁc policy
change, President Bush has appointed
Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt to head the
EPA. Leavitt’s appointment was stalled
in the Senate — Democrats there said his
refusal to answer direct questions, and
preference for ambiguous aphorisms
slowed the process — so we can only
speculate as to what his policies will be.

But his past shows a shady environ-
mental record;

While Leavitt’s supporters cite his
record of reducing urban sprawl and
keeping nuclear waste out of Utah, his
detractors cite his secret meetings with
the Interior Department to remove pro-
tections for wilderness areas, and his
highway project rtmning through wet-
lands around the Great Salt Lake.

It looks like it’s going to be a smoky
future. »

_ —— a non—partisan, non—proﬁt

Liberal media conspiracy? PIPA study says no

Is America, as a nation, gullible? Well,
based on the recently published results of a
large-scale survey, we certainly seem to be.

The Program on
International Policy Attitudes

research group that studies the
attitudes of the American public
and policymaking community
regarding international policy
issues —— joined Knowledge
Networks, a polling, social sci-

  

Given the profound inﬂuence the media
had on American popular support for the
war, it’s surprising that conservative dema-
gogues nationwide are still
decrying the media as liberal.
Over the past year, the United
States has been the center of

sy over its buildup to, and
involvement in, the war in
Iraq. Many otherwise inﬂuen-
tial nations were wringing

 

ence and market research ﬁrm,  " their hands in helpless conster-
to publish the results of a study J-R Frldy nation asAmerica pursued this
conducted from January to Columnist policy. Despite the vehement
September. The study dealt with opposition of the rest of the

the misconceptions Americans
held regarding the war in Iraq, and of how
different news sources aifected these mis-
conceptions. Choosing their large pool of
respondents randomly, PIPA took great care
to ensure that their results would be repre-
sentative of the entire adult population. Also,
being a non-proﬁt, non—partisan organiza-
tion, PIPA’s interests are not tied to the statis-
tics generated by this suryey. These statistics
draw into serious question the objective
integrity of American news media, and most
notably Fox News, with regard to the war in
Iraq. And they illustrate how willing the
American public is to accept at face value
whatever their favorite anchorman tells
them.

If nothing else, this report proves that
the American people need to be substantial-
ly more critical of their news sources.

world, a noteworthy majority

of Americans supported the war throughout
its every stage. At times of political contro-
versy, we carmot deny the powerﬁil inﬂu-
ence of mass media on the perceptions of the
general populace. As the major source ‘of
infonnation upon which members of the
public base their opinions, the media plays a
crucial role in deciding the prevailing char-
acter of the public’s perception of any issue.
It follows that news coverage throughout the
war, its buildup, and its aftennath, must be
considered among the principal inﬂuences
on American popular opinion regarding Iraq.
It’s unlikely that just any news coverage
would galvanize such widespread American
public support for such a controversial war.
If popular opinion is governed by the media,

then the media itself must have been in sup-

port of the war. However, short of a large-

ﬁerce intemational controver— ‘

scale survey, gauging the extent to which
people’s perceptions are inﬂuenced by news
media is a diﬂicult task Thankfully, we have
just such a survey. PIPA surveyed a total of
8,634 respondents over seven polls, regard-
ing three major misconceptions: that Iraq
was directly involved in the September 11,
2001, attacks and that there was evidence of
links between Iraq and Al—Qaida; that
weapons of mass destruction were found in
Iraq after the war; and that world public
opinion generally approved of the United
States going to war.

The results showed that 60 percent of
the respondents held at least one rnisconcep—
tion, of which 32 percent held one, 20 per-

cent held two and 8 percent held all

Not surprisingly, the greater number of mis-
conceptions held by any group of respon-
dents, the greater chance they supported the
war. To further elucidate these statistics, the
PIPA/KN polls conducted subsequent sur-
veys to detennine the primary news sources
of the respondents. Since 80 percent said
they tended more often to get their news
from television and radio, the polls focused
on the most popular news networks. '

With 18 percent citing it as their prirna— .
ry source of news, _Fox claimed the largest "

number of respondents. Of that 18 percent,

.80 percent held one or more of the three mis-

conceptions, more ﬂian any other group by

I at least 9 percent Respondents citing any of

the other networks as their primary news
sources, including print media, fell into a
range of 47 to 71 percent holding any num-

ber of the three misconceptions, except those
who preferred Public Broadcasting Service
or National Public Radio. Of the latter group,
only 23 percent held at least one of the three
misconceptions. The overwhelming majori-
ty of the news networks included in this poll
perpetuate misconceptions to substantial
portions of their audiences. They thereby
peddle popular support for President Bush’s
war. It’s times like these when the incessant
conservative griping about the so—called lib-

eral media seerns more ludicrous  ever.

Winning hearts and minds of Iraqi people harderthan just rebuilding

On Sunday, the Al Rasheed hotel, a temporary banacks
for United States military and civilian personnel, and which,
at the time, housed U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul
Wolfowitz, was hit by an early-moming barrage of rockets.
Though the rocket launcher was crude —— referred to as
a “science project” in Associated Press reports — it was
effective enough to wound l8 people and kill an
American colonel. In Baghdad on Monday, coordinat-
ed suicide attacks at the International Red Cross and
four Iraqi police stations killed at least 34 and injured
200. The attacks came within a 45-minute period, as
much as 10 miles apart

On Tuesday, a car bomb exploded near the police
station, killing at least four.

These are just a few of the total dead in Iraq. Pay
close attention to the news or go to httpJ/daily-
wamews.blogspot.com, which collects Iraq casualty
reports, and you realize how just how much blood is
being spilled every day.

“Deputy mayor of Baghdad assassinated in drive-by
shooting.” -

“Suicide bomber kills six at electric station in central
Fallujah.”

“Three U.S. and Polish soldiers killed in Karbala
ambus 

 That’s just part of T‘uesday’s entry.

President Bush’s response to the latest spate of killings
is that, “The more successﬁil we are on the ground, the more
these killers will react.” That certainly paints a rosy picture of
the current situation, along the lines of “with all these bomb-
ings, we must be doing something right.” The implication is

    

thatoontinuing onthispath—if, indeed, thereis apath-
will lead to the inevitable democratization of Iraq, with no
need to adjust our approach. This kind of faith-based foreign
policy makes it easy to avoid asking diﬂicult questions about
. _ the future of Iraq.

- One such question would be:
What, exactly, are we doing right?

In -the last six months, The
Toronto Star reports, Iraqi sentiment
has grown increasingly hostile. At the
end of the war, 43 percent of Iraqis
viewed foreign troops as liberators,
while 46 percent saw them as occu-
piers. Now, those statistics are much
more lopsided — 67 percent see them
as occupiers, with only 15 percent
believing them to be liberators.

It’s hard to argue with those kind
of statistics, at least not when they’re borne out by the
amount of explosions and sniper ﬁre takingplace on the
streets of Baghdad. This is the most vital battle for the United
States to win — the battle for the hearts and minds of the
people. “Without a concrete base ofgipport within the Iraqi
community, coalition efforts in Iraq will be plagued by guer-
rilla warfare. Right now, that base is speculatively, at best,
one-third of the Iraqi people. President Bush has argued that
the situation in Iraq is more under control than the media “lil-
ter” leads us to believe. He’s complained that for all the
media’s focus on dead Americans, they missed the bigger
picture. He’s not the only one complaining. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R—Wash., was quoted in his hometown paper,

Jesse Hicks
Columnist

The .Seattle’Post-Intelligencer, as saying, "The story of what
we’ve done in the postwar period is remarkable  It is a bet-
ter and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers
every day.”

Let’s assume tl1ey’re right — the American people are

a missing out on stories about the building of schools, the

restoration of electrical power in urban areas, the availability
of potable water. For the sake of argument, we’ll assume that
Nethercutt wasn’t being especially callous in his remarks and
that the progress in restructuring Iraq is obscured by the
smoke from all ﬂiose car bombs. We’re still left with those
dead soldiers. And those dead  They point to a much
deeper problem: the anger and resentment of a people who
view their former liberators as untrustworthy occupiers.

Rebuilding Iraq’s infrastructure is a — relatively --
short-terrn project It_will take billions of dollars, but it’s a
goal that can be accomplished with enough money and
enough materials. Convincing Iraqis that we have their best
interests at heart is a wholly different project But it is vital to
the success of those more tangible efforts.

. In the Bush administration and on the ground, there
seems to be very little understanding of this fundamental
need to build trust The President is content to slog ahead
with the same old strategy, and according to The New York
Times, is genuinely surprised to leam how poor the percep-
tion of American goals in Iraq is. Maybe tl1at’s because he
has his own ﬁlter: "The best way to get the news,” he says,

“‘is from objective sources. And the most objective sources

have are people on my staff.” , ’

Deceit on the We

Love and Revenge

www.|oveandrevenge.tv
Weekly
vkik

If you’re one of those people who
schedules their classes around their
favorite soap opera, here’s a new one for
you. But here’s the catch: forget trying to
dig your remote out from underneath your
couch cushions and go to www.loveandre—
venge.tv.

The beneﬁts: no commercials, no
drawn-out suspense that takes more than
several months/years to ﬁnd out which
mother is having her daughter’s
boyfn'end’s baby. You laugh, right? But
you know soap opera plots can take years
just to have a costume change.

Here’s where this newly anticipated
and riveting —— you’ll have to watch it for
yourself to see if wasting a box of two-ply
lavender-scented tissues is worth it —
soap opera comes into play.

The online soap opera, which, get
this, can be watched any time day or night,
premiered Sept. 25, with a cast of charac-
ters destined to win an Emmy. And if you
haven’t caught the sarcastic tone in my

voice yet, you would be the perfect fan for
this ridiculously plotted soap opera.

All right, now it sounds funny — or
serious if you really would use the two-ply
tissue — but I’m kind of hooked  the
tiniest bit. Who wouldn’t be when the ran-
domly issued episodes run between 12 and
20 minutes, and a new character is either
pregnant or dating their
boyﬁiend/girlfriend?

In every story, there are characters. I’d
like to say these characters aren’t ﬂat with
their layers of secrets, but it’s a soap opera.
If you don’t think these characters are ﬂat,
then you’ll love this online wonder. If you
do, you’ll ﬁnd it ﬁm to watch if you’re

ever having self-esteem issues: you’ll just

be thankful you didn’t hook up with your
brother, even if he isn’t blood-related. L
So, ﬁrst we have the Stratford family:
the powerful, wealthy family the online
saga. revolves around. The ﬁrst episode
(which is still downloadable — and free at
that) opens with Camille Stratford, the
daughter of Jackson and Elizabeth
Stratford, arriving home from college

abroad in Paris. Spoiled by everyone she
knows, she is the Gucci princess. Yet she

is heartbroken. And who wouldn’t be? She

child’s- . S 

just caught her signiﬁcant other, Jean-
Pierre, cheating on her with their English
professor. In coming back to the Stratford
household to gather peace of mind and
security from those she loves, Camille
returns home to much controversy.
Controversy, you ask? Well, mean-
while, her mother has taken an interest in
the 22-year-old coffee shop owner who is
in love with Camille. Her stepfather is
having an affair with his secretary, who is

me? Yeah, I hardly understand it, myself.
And to complicate matters, Carnille’s step-
brother, who is having an affair with his
father’s secretary and supposedly having
her child, is in love with his stepsister. If
you’ve lost me, his stepsister is Camille.
Trust me, watch this online soap
opera if you’re ever feeling bad about
yourself and need a good laugh.

Get spooked with the newest event

in American Shorts Reading Series

Does the thought of reading the

works of Edgar Allan Poe or Stephen ‘

King delight you? Are you unable to
live without regularly being scared wit-
less by creepy ghost stories? Are you in
the Halloween spirit and searching for
a way to be scared out of your mind?

If you answered yes to any of these
questions, you’re in luck. The newest
installment of the American Shorts
Reading Series, “Ghost Stories,” will
be held at Chatham College, the small
women’s college in the neighborhood
of Squirrel Hill, not far from Pitt.
Anybody who enjoys gathering around
a campﬁre and listening to devilish
escapades will be in his or her glory
tomorrow. V

Chris Josephs and Patrick Jorden,
both City Theatre and Civic Light
Orchestra veterans, will be lending
their vocal talents to the event. Josephs
will read Edgar Allan Poe’s tale of
‘revenge, “The Cask of Amontillado,”
and Jorden will bring to life H.P.
Lovecraft’s “In the Vault.”

Two American filmmakers will
also join in the fun. Martha Coleburn’s
short “The Evil of Dracula” — a mon-
tage of old—school horror images,
footage and advertisements —— is guar-
anteed to creep you out. And Stan
Brackhage’s ﬁlm “Dead,” which was
shot in a Paris' graveyard, will be
shown. Its

  Confessions of a rock novelist

Rock star; rock critic and rock novel-
ist Neal Pollack was in town on Oct. 14
with his band, The Neal Pollack Invasion. _

.He« managed to ﬁnd time to halt the rock-

ing and start the talking‘ before he got
 '. « W’ ‘:-.2,

In your story, there’s; a character with
your name. How muchof the story was
ﬁction and how much of it was humor?
It’s’ 100 percent ﬁction, I just use
humor as a literary device. It’s not humor
writing, it’s satire; it’s a comedy novel.

You  the story  told from the point

I of view of two fellow rock critics, name-

ly Paul St. Pierre and Neal Pollack.

. Considering you share your name with

one of them . . . .
He just has my name. I’m not really
goodwith coming up with names.

Between the character who shares your-
name and  character ‘Paul St_.:.i
Pierre,thereseemstobethis ..~. ”, I
Split personality? Well, eah, it’s true.
But the characters don’t really have that

. much to do with me, they’re based on

other rock critic characters from history.
There are little bits and pieces of my per-
sonality in them. In that sense, they’re a
split personality. In another sense, they’re
just ﬁctional characters. They don’t really
have that much to do with who I am at all.

So that’s why you kind of exaggerated
Neal Pollack’s character?

Yeah. I mean, that’s not really what
I’m like. There are a few things that he
does and says, that may be something I do
or say, but it’s not me. Paul St. Pierre is not
me. Although‘ again, every writer has a lit-
tle intellectual pretension, so, I’m a little
Paul St. Pierre. But for the most part,
they’re just ﬁctional characters based on
people I’ve, spoken to myself.

Why, exactly, is Neal Pollack’s charac-
ter so obnoxious? He does take advan-
tage of people — takes them for grant-
ed, at least.

I conceived him. as the ultimate
pathetic, drug—addict rock groupie. He’s
just like every rock stereotype rolled into
one. He’s just like a hipster who spans a
generation. So why is he so annoying? If
you’re going to write a comic novel, you
can’t have your character not be armoying.

What made you decide to write this
rock ‘n’ roll novel?

I read a couple of rock books, I was
looking for a topic for my next novel, and
I thought there was some room to make
fun of this sort of “genre” of rock writing.
I can’t remember one moment where I
waslike ‘Oh, this is what I must do.’

I What were some of the rock ‘n’ roll/

books you read?
“Please Kill Me” is an oral history of ‘

biography. “Positively

Greenwich Village folk

punk rock in the ‘60s
and ‘70s. Elvis Presley’s

4th Street,” which is a
story about the

scene. And then I

rock history, and I just  '
started - getting more I

critics to get the details right, because if
you’re going to do something like this,

you have to get the details right

You added a discography. Were any of
these albums an inspiration for writing
the book? 4

Every rock book has a discography at
the end, which is kind of ridiculous,
because it’s just a book, but it was also a
chance for me to take hot shots at bands
that I hadn’t been able to make fun of in
the book. I managed to get some addition-
al jokes in there. -

Tell me about the album

I know some musicians, and I.

brought them together to make an album
of some, of the ‘songs from the novel
because I wanted to provide a concrete
example of the rock I was both-praising
and making fun of, and I just wanted to
create a loud, fun garage record and a
loud, fun garage band. That was the inten-
tion, and it worked out very well. It was a
lot better than people thought it would be,
and the band was a lot better than people
thought it would be. We actually‘ put on a
lot of ﬁm shows on tour; it was great

your show, but it’s an adventure. That’s
something not a? lot of writers can say
about their book tours, but when you’re on
a rock .tour,'you’re always, on an adven-
Uure. Book tours are boring, and I don’t
wantltobore anyone.'Rock fn’ roll! Woo! ,

The Neal Pollack character claims that
rock ‘n’ rollhas to be awful. Does your
band follow this aesthetic?

Well, you know,‘ ‘good’ awful.
Unstudied, unpretentious, fun, dumb,
loud. That’s the idea. Then, of course, I’m
making fun of Pollack’s stance, too. Of
course, rock ‘n’ roll doesn’t have to be
awful. That’s just a kind of critical stance
a rock critic takes. But my band is pretty
close to his philosophy.

Is there anything else you’d like to add?

rve had some really great shows with
Pittsburgh, and I’d like that relationship to
continue. Don’t break up with me now,

Oh, we won’t.

Like father,
like daughter

It is just Jen Chapin, her body as her
instrument, and her bassist, _ -accompanist
and husband Stephan Crump by her side,
plucking away. As a team, they soul-
search, seek solutions for world problems
and devote time and relentless energy to
people — especially students. Tonight, the
New York City-based artist will share her
interpretations of her developed folky-
jazz style through music.

As the daughter of famous singer-
songwriter Harry Chapin, like any artist

’ coming from successful musical roots, she

was faced with the fear of potentially
standing in the shadow of her father.
However, when Chapin began playing her
earthy-toned urban—funk music in dive
bars or random garages, the audience
would listen intently and find her music to
be innovative. She pays homage to the
pathway that was left by her late father,
but curves from his legacy to create her
own masterpiece — her own music.

Chapin’s music is a statement, her
words precisely chosen to present and
portray city life, world hunger and what
the heart yearns for — connection and
love.

From a diverse background, Chapin
studied International Relations in Mexico
and studied jazz and funk at Berklee
College of Music. She taught music to stu-
dents in Brooklyn, performed at folk and
jazz festivals in New England and
Switzerland and has received various
awards. She has also performed at the
Sundance Film Festival.

Noted as a Norah Jones of the village,
she has a sensual and ﬂowing tone to her
voice, yet avfunky, whimsical and haunt-

ing lyricism in‘ her work. She conjures a‘

diverse spectrum of moods through her

"motif, noted as exquisite and potent.

Outside of music, Chapinis a social
activist, intensely devoted to education
and music making a difference in stu-
dent’s* lives. ‘She is also committed to
WHY (World Hunger Year), a nonprofit
organization which was founded by her
father and which works to build the bridge
between artists and grass-roots groups
ﬁghting against hunger and poverty across
the country. She also serves on the adviso-
ry boards of Kids Make a Difference and
Secret Smiles.

Her music seeks to address these
issues. Her voice evokes emotions
through words and somber tones.
Although currently Chapin has a small yet
devoted audience, her new CD, Linger,
intended to arrive on the shelves in

February 2004, is predicted to hit the pop

charts.

Jen Chapin will play at the Quiet Storm in

Friendship tonight at 8 p.m. - For more

Director misportrays poets

E3yhvka

Starring Gwyneth Paltrow,
Daniel Craig

Directed by Christine Jeffs
iksik

“Sylvia,” from director

Christine Jeffs (“Rain”), tells the
true story of the romance and mar-

riage of poets Sylvia Plath and Ted‘

Hughes. Plath, portrayed in the film
by Gwyneth Paltrow (“Shakespeare
in Love”), was an unbalanced
woman who attempted suicide mul-
tiple times over the course of her
life. She first met Hughes (Daniel
Craig) while attending Cambridge
—’ the two fell in love and were
married.

As they pursued their individual
writing careers, Hughes found suc-
cess while P1ath’s work met with
constant rejection. The strain that
jealousy placed on the marriage was
advanced by Plath’s fear that her
husband was having affairs. While
this was not initially true, her para-
noid accusations eventually drove
him to seek solace in the arms of
another. The two divorced, and
shortly after, Sylvia took her life by
sticking her head in an unlit stove.

The story is familiar; anyone
who has read Plath’s “The Bell Jar”
is aware of her famous suicide. The

point of retelling the story that
everyone knows is tobring to life
the passion of one of the 20th cen-
tury’s greatest romances and to pry
into the mind of a literary genius.
Unfortunately, this film accom-
plishes neither.

Under the direction of Jeffs,
“Sylvia” becomes a dull, shallow
representation of two truly brilliant
people. While Paltrow’s portrayal
of Plath is beautiful, it does not pry
into her psyche. Instead of seeing
an artist driven mad by genius, we
see an annoying, paranoid house-
wife. There’s no gradual downward
spiral into the abyss of depression
— instead, the director gives Sylvia
over in a few glaring moments with
blaring, melodramatic music. The
soundtrack, by the way, is pretty
bad. We don’t understand Plath, nor
can we even attempt to — the
Sylvia Plath presented by the film
doesn’t have the depth required for
understanding.Also. extremely
underdeveloped is the passion and
chemistry between Hughes and
Plath. In an attempt to capture. the
essence of their relationship, a
friend in the film says, “You under-
stand each other in ways that others
can only dream about.” Maybe, in
reality, this was true, but in the
film, any sense of understanding

between the two is lost after they

marry. Hughes is completely rea-
sonable,—Plath the opposite, and, as

‘a result, the two seem distant from

one another.'A great love stofy is
reduced to a mere going through of
the motions. .

This film is nowhere near as
good as it should be; however, it
does have its merits. ‘Both Paltrow
and Craig perform well, even if
they do lack chemistry. For viewers
not acquainted with Plath’s work, it

serves as a nice, though superficial,
introduction to her life story. If
you’re looking for a more in-depth
understanding, of Plath, however,

Cheap carves some Wooden
statues this weekend

This weekend, the Western
Pennsylvania Woodcarvers'Association
will celebrate their 10th annual wood-
cawing show, displaying intricate and
creative wood models as an art form.
The sole purpose of this association is
to promote woodcarv,ing. Carvers
nationwide join to display their works,
socialize and join in friendly competi-
tion.

Upon researching Woodcarving, I
found that there are speciﬁc wood prod-
ucts suitable for carving, such as
Cyprus knees, Diamond willow and
exotic wood. There are patterns to fol-
low and catalogs used to create works
of wood art. There are also woodcarv-
ing tools used by beginners and
advanced carvers.

This event is sponsored by Mon
Yough Woodcarvers from Elizabeth,
Pa., Pittsburgh Woodcarvers and
Beaver Valley Woodcarvers. Previous
years’ shows attracted woodcarvers
from the Pittsburgh area, Ohio, West
Virginia, New York and Michigan.

Woodcarving is an old-world tradi-
tion; the event gathers carvers of all

ages to join in social and artistic events.
This year will once again feature’
carvers competing in 11 categories.
Carvers will be evaluated on best carv-

ings in wildlife, caricature, real life,

waterfowl, birds, relief and chip carv-
ing. Demonstrations and techniques on

fine Woodcarving will also be part of

the weekend festivities. ;
The event will include hand—carved
door prizes, carving exhibitions and a
carving contest with cash prizes and
ribbons.If interested in exhibiting a
Woodcarving work of your own, contact
Pete Waslis at (412) 384-6867. For
more information on Woodcarving in
general, visit the informative Web site
www.woodcarving.org.

The Western Pennsylvania
Woodcarvers Association 2003 Show
will take place on Nov. 1 from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. and on Nov. 2 from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. at the Castle Shannon Volunteer

Halloween gets red hot at Sanctuary

On a typical_Th_ursday night, the I

dance ‘club Sanctuary is bursting at

Prancing through the opponents’
warm-ups. Kicking a pylon. Bumping
a referee. Calling Paul Tagliabue and
the rest of the National Football
League officers “slave masters.”

That’s what Tampa Bay defensive
end Warren Sapp has done in the past
few weeks, all but the last resulting in
fines from the league. On Sunday,
Sapp sat down with ESPN’s Michael
Irvin, a former pro, to talk about his
comments. In the interview, he said
that the league was against any form
of self-promotion by players and inter-
ested only in what it could market as
being “for the shield.” He pointed out
that players can no longer take their
helmets off, and most people don’t
recognize the faces of major football
players, as opposed to basketball play-
ers, many more of whom are identifi-
able.

In other words, the league hates
Sapp, not because he breaks its rules,
but because he’s more interested in
himself than making money for the
league, and that, even if it’s not about
race, it is about the people on top ver-

-sus the people working for them.

And he’s absolutely right.

I don’t like Sapp and I don’t sup-
port his actions, which I think are the
opposite of what sports are about. His
defense of those actions — that foot-
ball should be entertainment, so who
cares, as long as it’s fun —— is ridicu-

lous and shows a lack of understand-

ing about professionalism.

But he stumbled onto something
true, and it’s something that is true
beyond the NFL. Whether or not Sapp
meant his comments to be about race,

Tennisfinishes fall season with losses in tournament

AUS'I‘IN HERTZOG
Staff Writer

The fall season is over for the Pitt women’s tennis
team, and although it featured many victories as indi-
viduals and as a team, the final weekend allowed -nei-
ther, with no Pitt participant advancing out of the first
round.

Members of Pitt’s women’s tennis team traveled to
Blacksburg, Va., last weekend to’ play in the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association ‘Championship. The
tournament is the largest women’s tournament in the
country, featuring 45 different teams from the East
Coast, ranging from New -England to Virginia.

While this tournament was going on, eight other
tournaments of the same nature went onaround the
country. The finalists of the doubles and sin-gles ﬂights
of each tournament will then go on to the National
Indoor Championships in the spring.

“It was great to go to play in the best tournament in
the country. I knew we had a good chance to draw real-
ly tough opponents, and that’s what happened,” Pitt
head coach George Dieffenbach said. “Even though the
girls weren’t able to come away with any wins, it was
a good experience to see the next level so we can strive
to keep improving.”

In singles action for Pitt was Becky Emmers, who
was faced off against the Carolyn“Kramer of Virginia

Tech. Kramer proved to be too much for Emmers, win-,

ning the match, 6-0 and 6-2. . T V

The team of Hayley Hughes and Annie Davies par_-I

ticipated in the doubles flight-for.Pitt‘ and "drew

Beatrice Grasu and Meghan Wolfgram, the ninth-seed-‘

ed team from Richmond. The Richmond team con-
trolled the match, all-owing Pitt to win only one game
and taking the match over Hughes and Davies, 8-1.
“Our girls were very competitive, but [Grasu and
Wolfgram] had great shot—making ability and really
worked the angles of the court,” Dieffenbach said. “We
had won some rounds in past years [at the ITA

Championship], "but this year, it just wasn’t meant to

be.” —

The team will .have conditioning practice three days
a week until Thanksgiving, when tennis will give way
to academics. " P ’

“We will be in the gym working on ﬂexibility,
agility and becoming stronger and faster, but as our
season ends, this is truly the time" when "academics
should be their focus,” Dieffenbach said.

Practices on the tennis court resume in J anuary, and
the spring season begins on Feb. 21 against
Georgetown.

helping me out; the lack of help resulted in a j

parking ticket.

‘ Besides the fact I am now up to 18 tickets on

~FACT. Because of this, I have decided to call

once a day with a random question, just to be a

the same, and I urge you to do the same. Maybe .

many people can shoot the ball at once? Not
enough on several NBA teams.

With the addition of several players, how will
Dallas, the Lakers, Philly and Minnesota cope? I
think two will struggle — Philly and L.A. —-

but for now, the others.

Carmelo Anthony may be, the most complete

Darko Milicic may be the next Yao Ming, but
with five times the athletic ability. There are sev-

Pitt-Virginia Tech game
to be nationally televised

When the Panther foot-
ball team takes on the
Virginia Tech Hokies Nov.
15 at Heinz Field, they will
do so on either ESPN or
ESPN 2. The decision of
which channel will air the
game will be made‘ the
Monday before the game.
Kick-off is set for 7:45
p.m.

The Panthers are look-
ing to knock off the Hokies
for the third straight year
after defeating them last
year in Blacksburg, Va.,

28-21 — behind three
touchdown catches by
wide receiver Larry

Fitzgerald — and upsetting
Virginia Tech in 2001 at
Heinz Field.

Macke Named Big East
co-Player of the Week

a foes

Another school record
fell this past weekend, but
this time it didn’t fall to
Larry Fitzgerald.-

Lindsey Macke, a
junior setter for the volley-
ball team, was named Big
East co-Player of the
Week, making her the fifth
Panther to receive the
honor, this year, which
eclipses the previous
school record of four.

Macke, a Fort Thomas,
Ky., native, averaged
14.67 assists per game in
Pitt’s two victories this
weekend over conference
Seton Hall
Rutgers.

Her 1,165 assists rank
sixth all-time in the
Panther record books, and
Macke is leading the Big
East in assists per game
with 13.72, which also
ranks in the top 10 in the
nation.

Tlie Panthers are off to
their best start in years at
18-3; they have won 12
matches in a‘row and 16 of
their last 17.

and ‘

Lindsey Macke (No. 7), shown during action earlier this
season, was named Big East co-Player of the Week.

‘the soon-to—be free agent

Sapp: League does not want players to get recognition

Heller-LaBelle, page 14

people below are, largely, not. And the way the people on
top get richer is when they tell the people below exactly

what to do.

People don’t liketo talk about the fact that the vast

majority of professional athletes are not white, and that the
vast majority of the owners, commissioners, general man-
agers and executives are. And it’s hard to see how paying
someone millions of dollars to tackle someone else getting
paid millions of dollars could ever be construed as keeping
that person down.

Except that the guy paying those checks is getting
many, many more millions. And it’s in his interest that the
people he’s paying do as little to draw attention to them-
selves as possible. After all, don’t he treat his people good?

Or look at college athletics. Can you name a black ath-
letics director? And there, none of the athletes are getting
paid anything. They’re not even allowed to talk to an agent.
But they’re allowed to make millions of dollars for the men
in that big, clean, white office at the top.

How about the hip-hop industry? “But,” one might say,
“rap stars get paid millions to talk dirty to a backbeat.” And
it is all so the record executive, who is white, gets his tens
of millions. .

Wait, I’ve got one more: the next time you get pissed
off at a Pitt food service worker for making your sandwich
a little too slowly, think about all of the people making
money off of that worker. Think of how little of that money
the worker will ever see. And why not say it: that worker is
probably black, and the person making that money is deﬁ-
nitely white.

The NFL has very clear punishments for offenses.

. ~ » u . . . \

Bumping a ref is $15,000. The second time, $25,000. So
why did Tagliabue tell Sapp he was lucky to not be sus-
pended? Sapp’s a great player on a great team. He’s also
someone people love to watch. Love .enough to pay
Tagliabue for it. Who, again, is lucky Sapp’s playing?

One might argue that any player would be punished the
same way, regardless of race, as long as he had Sapp’s his-
tory. All Bill Romanowski did was break his teammates
eye socket this year, after a 15-year career of temper prob-
lems and continued unprofessionalism. ”

The NFL didn’t fine Romo for that little scufﬂe, which
put Marcus Williams out for six to eight weeks. They did

(ﬁne him in 1997 for spitting in the face of opposing receiv-

er J.J. Stokes —— $7,500, half of Sapp’s latestvfine. But if
you want history, Romo has been ﬁned by the league for
punching Tony Gonzalez, kicking Larry Centers in the
head, ripping Eddie George’s helmet off and three separate
illegal hits.

The only ﬁne of Romo greater than Sapp’s? Breaking,

Kerry Collins’ jaw in 1997, which cost him $20,000.
Collins, for the record, is also white. ,

But, really, can you expect the league to care about
white men ending black men’s seasons when there are black
men out there kicking pylons and bumping into referees?

Again, the NFL’s hardly the founder of the ideology —
they just perfected it. That’s why there’s no response to
Sapp’s statements. Who cares what he says, as long as he
shows up to play and people tune -in to watch? And all
Tagliabue needs to do is sit back in his chair, light another
cigar, and, as Ralph Ellison said, keep that black boy run-
ning. -

equal the hype, he will surpass it

Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant

Who can offer something that
equals Kobe’s value? No one. Who

Lakers? “

The Lakers, hhowever -——'pend— 1

ing a rape conviction for Bryant —
will _be a playoff force, and Shaq
and Kobe will play nice till the sea-

finals.

vNo. 1: Prediction time.

The Spurs will win the West and
go on to play the New Jersey Nets
in the‘ NBA finals. Since the
Steelers struggled, the sports Gods
will .finally stop teasing mehin the
NBA and give me this one —Nets
in seven games. 1

"Tim Duncan will win his‘? third
consecutive - MVP, and “King
James” will be the Rookie of the
Year and begin his reign as NBA
savior. The torch — ‘which Michael
Jordan left in the air — will be
grasped and taken to Cleveland.-
