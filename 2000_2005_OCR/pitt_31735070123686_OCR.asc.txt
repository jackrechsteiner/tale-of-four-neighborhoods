VOLUME 34 ° NUMBER 12 FEBRUARY21, 2002 UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Pittmum on what poor state  

budget outlookmeans here

nlike their counterparts _

in the State System of

Higher Education, Pitt
administrators aren’t speculating
publicly about how much they
would hike tuition next fall if
Pennsylvania legislators approve
Gov. Mark Schweiker’s recom-
mended budget. .

But the budget numbers
aren’t pretty. ,

Schweiker proposes cutting
state subsidies of Pennsylvania’s
state—related universities (Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln)

"by. 5 percent for the ﬁscal year
.that begins July 1.

Tuition income and the state
appropriation are Pitt’s twomain

sources of unrestricted funds,

"  
1» 1.e., money that’sinot earmarked
’ for speciﬁc research or building

projects.

To compensate for a 5 percent
decrease inastate funding, Pitt
would need to raise tuition
by 3.4 percent on top of any
inﬂation-based tuition increase
— assuming Pitt chose to make
up" for the Schweiker—proposed
cut solely by raising tuition,‘

said Vice Chancellor for Budget ‘
V and Controller Arthur G. Rami—

cone.

That’s not taking into account
the fact that Pennsylvania already
has imposed a 3 percent freeze
on current appropriations to

state—related universities. For

Pitt, the freeze amounts to nearly
$5 .4 million, out of an approved
$178.5 million appropriation. If
state revenues continue to fall
short of proj ections, which seems
likely, lawmakers _will withhold
the $5 .4 million from’Pitt’s ﬁnal
FY 2002 payment from the state,
in June. '

In the FY 2003, funding
request that Pitt submitted

to Harrisburg, the University

proposed limiting next fall’s
tuition increase to 4 percent, but
only if Pitt gets the full amount it
is requesting for next year: $186
million, or 4.3 percent more
than Pitt’s currentlapprovedi
appropriation.’ ~
Faced with a potential budget
squeeze similar to Pitt’s, leaders
of Pennsylvania’s 14 state—owned
universities said Schweiker’s plan
would force them to eliminate
programs and raise tuition by
nearly 13_ percent next fall. ’
Despite being “inundated”
with inquiries from the news

media, Pitt ‘(which hiked its

' tuition by 7.5 percent last fall)

won’t discuss possible‘ tuition

 

increases or program cuts yet,
Pitt’s chief Harrisburg lobbyist
told the University Senate
budget policies committee (BPC)
recently. A V

G. Reynolds Clark, executive
director of Pitt’s community and
governmental relations ofﬁce,
said: “It’s still early in the budget
process. The [budget] lines "that
Gov. Schweiker has proposed are
not castin concrete yet. We’re
taking a cautious and cooperative

1 approach.” .

But some faculty members

-. on BP_C'recommend_ed a noisy

approach instead: Detailing
publicly how state funding cuts
would hurt Pitt students and

  
   

   

     

Carr said?" “I understand the
need to be politic and to work
with the legislature. But to. say

that we will just absorb [funding

cuts] seems to me to be very
counterproductive. There should
be a visible cost or consequence
to these things.” .

Referring to this year’s 3
percent freeze, Carr continued:
“Either we are all deluded and
we have 53 percent fat in our
budget, or there will be rea_l
consequences” from cutting
Pitt’s budget by that percentage.
“I’m not in a position to know
what the real consequences are,
but I’m sure that ifyou ask
people they could come up with
Ronald Reagan-esque stories of
ﬁring people or cutting desirable

G‘. Reynolds Clark, executive
director of Pitt's community
and governmental relations,
office, told the Senate's
budget policies committee:
"It's still early in the budget

process. The [budget] lines

that Gov. Schweiker has pro-
posed are not cast in concrete
yet. We're taking a cautious
and cooperative approach."

     

programs or courses that would
have to be canceled.”

According to Vice Chancellor
Ramicone, most Pitt units would
absorb _a 3 percent cut this year
through one-time measures such
as deferring computer purchases
and reducing spending on travel
(which already was down at Pitt
by2 0 percent last fall, a reduction
that Ramicone attributed to
skittishness following Sept. 11’s
terrorist attacks). .

As for next year’s cuts, Rami-
cone warned: “We have to be
careful whafwe threaten. . . .If we
threaten layoffs, we have to be
prepared to follow through if the

state reduces our budget.”

on teachers’ competency exams

report released last
A month by the state’s
Bureau of Teacher
Certiﬁcation and Preparation
(BTCP) cited low passing rates
in certain required competency
tests taken for the ﬁrst time by the
state’s prospective elementary
and secondary school teachers.

' The report suggested that '

the state’s institutions of higher
learning are at fault for poorly
preparing their students.

_But School’ of Education‘

Dean Alan. Lesgoldisaid Pitt is"
P not part of the problem.” Pitt

education students who took the

~ tests last year did far better than if

the state averages ofiﬁrst—ti,me_
test—takers on virtually every
test. ’

Lesgold, however, cautioned

not to compare apples with
oranges.

The BTCP results, compiled-
by the state, record scores (either V

pass or fail) of those taking the
tests last, year for the first time
regardless of their educational
status. Anyone can take the

tests, not just those who are in‘
graduate education programs‘
A such as Pitt’s. In fact, many stu-

dents take the basic competency

tests as part of the graduate

admissions process, something
Pitt plans to start requiring next

year. ~

Lesgold said there ‘are plenty
of examples how ﬁrst—time test-

takers give a distorted view of the
quality of teacher preparation,
especially at a selective school
such as Pitt: _
“Suppose you’re a college
sophomore, and your adviser says
you’ll have’ a better chance to get
into aneducation school if you
pass some of the requirements
beforehand,” the dean said. “You
take one of these tests, fail -it
miserably, and .you decide not
to go into education at all; that

appears as aifailed test score [on ’ V

the BTCP report]. Or, you can

take it again, andpass it prior.
-to education school admission

and that would not be reﬂected
on the first-time scores although
you’ve demonstrated compe-
tency.” - .

To date, Lesgold said,’ Pitt
has strongly encouraged that
applicants pass the competency
tests prior to admission to most
of its programs. But Pitt plans
to make this a ‘requirement for
most applicants starting this
fall. “We may admit someone
provisionally, and ask that they

pass the tests before the start of *
the program to gain full status,” _
Lesgold said.

He noted that the compe-
tency tests are only one indica-
tor that point to good teacher
preparation. (See story on page

Pitt reports test scores of its
currently enrolled students as

required under Title II of the
1998 amendments of the federal
Higher Education Act. A

A Last year, Pitt education
students scored an equal or

, higher passing rate than the
‘ state average of the 92 teacher
preparation programs in 16 of
I the 17 tests in subjects for which

Pitt offers teacher "preparation.
That included a 100 percent

and no passing» rate lower than
91 percent. _

Of the 1,881 Pitt scores on
the exams _last year, only 45 were
not passing. (Most students took
more than one test.) 4 .

“Our scores are amazingl
good, even when compared
to those schools we consider

‘ our competitors,” Lesgold said.

Pitt’s cémpetitors include the
University of Pennsylvania, Penn
State, Lehigh, Indiana University
of Pennsylvania,- Duquesne and
Temple,'he said.

The dean suggested. three
reasons for Pitt education stu-
dents’ high passing rates. “First,
we have the post—baccalaureate
program, so that ‘our students
generally know the subject matter
they’re going to teach by the time
they get to us, and they’ve earned
a bachelor’s in that area. Second,
we’ve always had a relatively
high admissions threshold, so

His academic career began at
Harvard in 1968, where he was

appointed assistant professor of '

surgery in 1972. . I

In 1973, he joined the faculty
of the University of Iowa Col-

chief of transplant surgery at the
Starzl institute, said Corry “was
the epitome of the academic
surgeon, someone who was
respected by his peers and stu-

in patient care and the science
of surgery, someone who perse-

vered in,an_era of great uncer-

tainty. He was a cornerstone of

the transplant program here and '

will truly be missed.”

Corry performed the first
combined liver and pancreas
excision from a single donor and
transplanted the organs -into two
recipients. He performed more

than 350 pancreas transplanta— ,

University post-doctoral fellows

toral fellow here, he assumed
—- incorrectly — that he could
continue to ride Port Authority
buses for free, a perk enjoyed by
most Pittsburgh campus faculty,
staff and students. .

“I was surprised to learn that,
once I became a post-doc, I lost
this privilege,” said Assad, a
post-doc who spoke on condition
that his real name not appear
in print.

“Not only couldn’t I ride the
buses for free anymore, I was
no longer permitted to pay for a
space in the University lot
where I had been parking during
the summer. It was as if I was
being punished for earning my
Ph.D.” .

Actually, post—docs aren’t the
only members of the Pittsburgh
campus community who do not
qualify for free Port Authority
bus rides. Some 2,700 volunteer
faculty also are excluded, as are
hundreds of trainees, unpaid
staff and others.

But according to post-docs
seeking to organize a Pitt Post-
Doctoral Association, being left
out of the Pitt-Port Authority
agreement symbolizes their
outsider status.

“We sort of fall through
the cracks of the University’s
structure,” said Stuart Olmsted, a

Wpostzdoc"at*me~MageerWom:ens

Some “interesting dynamic

Reynolds Clark, exec-

G utive director of Pitt’s

0 community and gov-

ernmental relations ofﬁce, cited

what he called “some interesting

dynamics” in this year’s budget
process:

' Mark Schweiker is a one-
year, one—term governor who’s
not running for re—election and
therefore can take a harder line
in defending his budget recom-
mendations. On the other hand,
legislators know Schweiker won’t
be in ofﬁce next year to retaliate
for attacks on his proposals.

° Because the state economy R
has been strong in recent years,’

many junior members of the

1 General Assembly have no expe-

rience in hammering out a bal-
anced budget with decreased
state revenues, as they will be
forced to do this year.

0 A number of key legisla-
tors have announced that they
won’t seek re—election, including

Research Institute. “We’re not
students anymore, we’re not
faculty members yet, and we’re
not staff. The pay and beneﬁts
we receive vary. We don’t all get
the same compensation for the
same amount of experience.

“Most post-docs think it’s
ridiculous thatwe can’t ride
[Port Authority] buses for free.
But that’s a pretty small issue,
compared with salaries and work
conditions.”

To determine which issues
matter most to Pitt post—docs,
Olmsted and a number of his
colleagues are circulating an
e—mail survey. It lists post-doc
salary guidelines recommended
by the National Institutes of
Health (ranging from $2 8,2 60 for

first-year post—docs to $44,412

for those with seven or more
years of experience) and asks
respondents to indicate how
their pay compares with the
NIH guidelines. The survey also
asks post-docs about their fringe
beneﬁts, where they work within
the University, and issues of
concern to them.

Olmsted said a summary of
survey results will be presented
to Pitt administrators, includ-
ing the person hired to ﬁll a
new Health Sciences position:
director of career development.
Post—doctoral affairs will be
among the new administrator’s
responsibilities.

House appropriations committee
chairpersonjohn Barley. “Some
of these legislators are: going to
be voting on a budget for the last
time,” Clark noted. “VVhether
that’s good or bad, I don’t know,
but we have to be aware of that
dynamic.”

Approving a budget for the
governor’s consideration requires
a simple majority vote of both
the House and Senate. The
Republicans control both houses
as well as the governor’s ofﬁce,
but Clark said: “That doesn’t
mean they’re all in accord.

“I think there’s some dis-
agreement [among members
of the General Assembly and
the\governor’s ofﬁce and other
cabinet ofﬁcers as to where some
of these state monies should and
should not be allocated.”

of great interest to Pitt is the

800 post-docs are in the medi-
cal school, and another 130

Sciences schools, according

_to the University’s Office of

Institutional Research.

Olmsted said he and other
post—docs hope to hold an orga-
nizational meeting of the Pitt
Post-Doctoral Association in
March. Post-docs, unlike faculty,
staff, and undergraduate and
graduate students, do not cur-
rently have their own campus
organization and are not repre-
sented on University Senate
groups or—on Board of Trustees
committees.

Nor are there grievance
procedures for most post-docs,
as there are for faculty, staff and
grad students.’

“Right now, if you have a

problem with your boss -— your
quote—unquote ‘adviser’ —— you
have no one to go to,” Olmsted
said. “Graduate students who
haveiproblems with their faculty
advisers can go to their depart-
ment chairs, but we have no
one.”

“It’s not even that post—docs
have to begin speaking with one
voice,” Olmsted added, with a
laugh. “We just need to speak,

we should be treating better,

Steven Phillips, associate
dean for graduate studies in
Pitt’s medical school, called
formation of a Pitt post-doctoral
organization “a very good idea.”
Similar organizations, he noted,
are being formed at a growing
number of research universities
—— more than 60, including Penn
State and the University of
Pennsylvania, according to the
journal Science. _

Post-docs, Phillips said, are
“very vulnerable” because their
training is not governed by
uniform curricula or employ-
ment policies.

Phillips began his own post-
doctoral fellowship 3O years
ago, after earning his Ph.D.
in biophysics. “There was an
understanding that it would be
an intensive period of training
in a laboratory with a faculty
mentor, and for that I would get
a stipend,” the associate dean
recalled.

“Because there were no insti-
tutionalized standards of training
and compensation for post-docs,
individual investigators could
feel free to set their own policies,
to some extent.

“That’s still the way it works
today,” Phillips said. “A post-
doctoral fellow comes into a
laboratory and works there for
a mentor with no oversight,
really. The NIH has set national
standards for levels of post-

. doctoral fellows’ compensation,

but they’re only recommenda-
tions.”
According to Phillips, Pitt

 

..,._..' I
his
group’s survey of post-docs
indicate the same.

One reason it’s difﬁcult for
universities to impose uniform
standards for post-docs’ pay and
work conditions is that funding
to support post-docs comes from
various sources, Phillips noted.

“Funding [for post-docs]
can come_ through individual,
investigator-initiated grants.
There are also NIH training
grants for post-docs. And, in
some cases, funding for post-
docs comes from center or
departmental monies,” he said.

Baranger said Pitt professors
and/or administrators, includ-
ing members of the University
Research Council and the Uni-
versity Council on Graduate
Studies, have examined the status
of post-docs and recommended‘
actions such as designating an
individual in each school to
handle post-doctoral issues.
But little action has resulted
from such recommendations,
she said.

Nationally and at Pitt, aver-
age ages of post-doctoral fellows
are edging up into the mid—3 Os or
even older, as more professorial
wanna—be’s complete more than
one fellowship prior to gaining
faculty status.

According to Associate Dean
Phillips, “Doing more than
one post-doc appointment was
infrequently heard of 10 years
ago and unheard of 20 years ago.
The claim is that, to accumulate
the necessary credentials for
competing for academic posi-
tions at research universities
these days, you have to have
more than one post-doc.”

*3)

BY BETH J. HARPAZ

oes the reporter’s gender
make a difference in
news coverage?

Not when it comes to objec-
tivity, ethics, deadlines, respon-
sibilities, the skills and tools of
the trade, says veteran Associated
Press reporter Beth J. Harpaz.

But, some of the anecdotes
in her book about covering
Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2000
senatorial campaign suggest that
a reporter’s gender does matter
when the candidate is among the
most famous women in the world,
one of the most difficult to read
and has a staff of predominantly
women.

To wit:

° An off—the-cuff discussion

between candidate Clinton and ‘

reporter Harpaz about potty-
training, which, to Harpaz’s
horror, made the lead story on
an 11 p.m. local TV newscast
during the campaign.

° Companion incidents that
demonstrated the difference
between the way Clinton’s staff
and her Republican opponent’s
staff treated female reporters
while each candidate was seeking
votes from the orthodox Jewish
community.

° At the watershed moment
of the campaign, during the
first televised debate between
the candidates, Republican Con-
gressman Rick Lazio is perceived
as a bullying sexist.

Harpaz’s experience, chroni-
cled in the book “The Girls in
the Van: Covering Hillary” [St.
Martin’s Press, 2001], suggests
that a woman reporter does not
always have equal opportunity,
that issues traditionally more
important to women may get
more exposure from a female
reporter, and that women as a
voting bloc (or, more accurately,
two blocs, one of Clinton admir-
ers and one of Clinton haters)
were crucial to the outcome.

“I was never able to get editors
to admit that they consciously
chose a woman to cover Hillary,”

Harpaz told a Pitt audience at '

a, Feb. 12 lecture titled “Hillary
Clinton, the Voters and the
Media: AWoman’s Perspective,”
sponsored by the women’s studies
program. “The big three New
York dailies, the Times, the
Post and Daily News, all had
men reporters; but almost all of
the [other news services] sent
women.”

‘HILLARY

  n

Harpaz speculates that, con-
sciously or not, editors didn’t
want the same old campaignstuff
and were looking for the fresh
look of a woman’s perspective.

Harpaz says she wrote “Girls
in the Van” for three reasons:
to preserve the story of a ﬁrst-
of—its-kind campaign, where a
former First Lady won elective
ofﬁce for ﬁrst time in history;
to give an insider’s look at the
press corps’ role covering the

campaign, including choices of '

what to cover and what should
be the lead of a story, and to
compare the atmosphere, of ‘a

i mostly female press corps with its

mainly male counterpart typical
of most campaigns. -

Harpaz says the book’s title
intentionally echoes “The Boys
on the Bus,” Timothy Crouse’s
chronicle of press coverage
of the 1972 Nixon-McGovern
presidential campaign, in order
to draw then-and—now compari-
sons. ' A

“Some things are exactly the
same [as the “Boys on the Bus”]:'
the [eroding] emotionalmaturity
of the press corps —— 20 of us
packed in a van whining and
moaning as we traveled, breaking
out into silly songs, getting to
know the speeches by heart to
where we could mouth them
along with Hillary,” in short,
surviving the tedium of a very
long campaign.

“I’m not sure that the stories
we wrote were all that different,
but there was a different ‘feel’
[to them].”

That feel is partly due to
changes in technology from
generations past, which have
spawned what Harpaz calls “the
media beast.”

Live satellite feeds, 24-hour
cable news networks and the
Internet, where news is updated
constantly, have created a vora-
cious appetite for news, and
editors want something on their
news web site and they want
it now.

“We are required to feed the
need, and people who make news
know the need is out there. Every
time they open their mouths
they have a chance to get to the
next round of what’s posted on
a news web site,” she says. “So
a lot of times we ﬁnd ourselves
running‘ after what is not really
news to feed the hunger.”

Perhaps the biggest [difference

from the campaigns of 30-plus
years ago, Harpaz says, is that
that world was practically ‘all
male, candidates and press corps
alike. *

“Hillary’s staff was virtually all
female; Lazio had one woman on
his staff, essentially to accompany
his wife.” v

And the fact that one of the
candidates was a woman makes
a difference, Harpaz says. “One
funny thingithat happened:
VVhen I came back from a vaca-
tion I was telling my mostly
women colleagues that I had
potty-trained my 2-year-old. I

- guess that-’s the female» corollary

for men talking about sports.”
At that point Clinton joined

the group welcoming Harpaz

back‘ to the campaign trail. “I

' guess it was on my mind, so I told

Hillary the same thing. She told
the group, ‘This woman deserves
a round of applause!’

“The kicker was: that night at

a reporter to a‘ candidate she’s
covering. Had she herself crossed
the line of professionalism? “I
just told the most famous woman
in the world I potty-trained my
2-year-old. I kept thinking if the
candidate was a man, wouldI have
self—censored my response, or if
I had given the same -response,
would the conversation have
continued as it did?

“In a wayit’s a trivial example.
But, on the other hand, this is
a candidate who really appealed
to women, who really courted
women as a separate constitu-
ency with so many of her issues
— child welfare, health and
education, working families, day
care —— and in thinking about
that, it shows that even potty-
training becomes relevant.”

In retrospect, the incident is
symbolic of a trend, Harpaz says.
“It gets to a larger thing that’s
been happening in the news for
a while, that as more women get
into the position of reporting
the news, the deﬁnition of what
is news has changed.

“A1 generation ago, a story-

about breast cancer would prob-
ably not have been on the front
page or thesubject of editorials
in all the major newspapers. I
think what we might be seeing
here is that the deﬁnition of what
is newsworthy has changed as
women are more prominent in
the media, reporting the news
and producing the news.”

Even in today’s war—time
fervor, stories about Afghani
women have become important
news, she points out.

' 71‘:

‘ ‘‘ “Another -instance iI”i'*the=cam- 5 * 

paign where gender came into
play was when the candidates
were courting the orthodox
Jewishvote.

school vouchers, one of his big

to the same group. “Not only
that, but in talking about jobs,
housing,‘ health care, she got
the endorsement,” Harpaz says,
with a satisﬁed smile.

a 75'

As thejcampaign hit full stride
in fall 2000, a series of televised
debates separated the candidates
on more than the issues, Harpaz
says. In the ﬁrst debate, Lazio,
evidently trying to show he
could stand up to the more
well-known Clinton, crossed
the stage and waved a paper at
Clinton, demanding that she sign

a document supporting the ban -

of soft money in campaigns.

“We just thought it was

silly. We were laughing in the
press room,” Harpaz says. “We
thought that on issues Lazio
won the debate, or at least held
his own.” ‘

But Lazio misread the audi- '

ence’s reaction and kept pressing
the matter. Form took prece-
dence over substance. “Frankly,
most voters don’t care about
campaign soft money or cam-

paign ﬁnancing. All campaign ‘

money is dirty to them. In all the
focus groups after the debate,
people reacted very negatively
[to Lazio’s tactics], especially
women. Lazio even tried to claim
reverse sexism, that if a woman

did that move she’d be forgiven, ' 1

but a man can’t do it.”

Hillary also made mistakes,
Harpaz says, including referring
to a‘ gunshot victim who had
survived and was seated‘ in the
front row as a murder victim.
Harpaz says she wrestled with
her lead to that story. After

unscripted part of an otherwise
canned event. “The First Lady
supports gun control? We know
that already.” ‘ . ,
Eventually, she led her story
with Clinton’s mistake. “I think
in retrospect it was the right
decision. Wasn’t this symbolic
of a larger issue? She’s supposed

11:15, my mother-in-law called
and said, ‘Hillary was just on the
TV news talking about how you
potty-trained Nathaniel.’ VVhat?
How did that happen?

“Unbeknownst to me, the
cameras had been rolling, and
a woman reporter for the local
afﬁliate had capturedtthis on
tape, decided to include it in
her report on Hillary and the
producer of the broadcast used
it for the lead on the 11 o’clock
news.”

The reporter’s rationale,
Harpaz discovered afterward,
was that this was a good example
of “how Hillary, who had this
ofﬁcious reputation, who was
reserved, who was always ‘on,’
would drop the formality, raise
the curtain a little, be human and
sort of chat — and [the reporter]
was trying to capture that.”

This incident made Harpaz
reflect on the relationship of

issues,” Harpaz says. _

Lazio nonetheless had
arranged to speak before a group
of orthodox Jews. But when the

' press corps went to cover the
event, a rabbi barred the women

from attending.

“Lazio didn’t even know that
[certain events are] separated
by gender, so the women in the.
press corps were forced to wait
out on the street because he
hadn’t asked the rabbi to make,
some sort of accommodations
for us.

“Having covered stories [in
the Jewish community], I know
there are ways to accommodate

women. But we were left stand-

ing on the sidewalk. It never
occurred to anyone on Lazio’s
staff to call ahead in order to
accommodate us,” Harpaz says.

State competency tests measure

only part of what makes a good  

teacher, education dean insists

at makes a good
teacher?
There’s no simple

answer, of course. But according
to Pitt’s School of Education
Dean Alan Lesgold, there is much
more to teacher preparation
than what’s measured by state-
required competency tests.‘
“You have a lot of issues that
go into preparing a good teacher,
especially for the younger aged
kids,” Lesgold said. “Yes, you
want teachers to know math
and how to write and know
science, but you also want them
to know how to work With young
children, how to be loving and
caring.” ' '
Instructio-nal psychology,

s

. therefore, is an important com-

ponent of a. teacher’s training,
Lesgold said. "A ‘ - ,
“If you’re going to bexa
teacher, you need to know
something about how the mind
works, about learning habits,
about behavioral psychology,
and something about the main
ideas in instruction, including
certain basic issues like keeping
your class orderly. If you can’t

and a chair, you’ve got some
problems.” 0 ' ,

tion to prepare our students for
that part. But it’s a delicate issue:

V students and, third, we have a

very high—quality faculty here.”

According tojeff McCloud,
deputy press secretary for the
state Department of Education,
practically anyone can take the
basic competency tests, .a neces-
sary hurdle for earning teacher
certiﬁcation - and sometimes a
requirement for education school
admission. ’Tests can be taken
any number of times.

-In addition to demonstrating
basic_ skills in reading, writing
and math, passing a competency
subject—area test is required for
stateteaching certiﬁcation in that
subject (except for “emergency

' , exemptions” granted by the state

to mitigate teacher shortages).
General knowledge also is
measured, and knowledge of
pedagogy- is measured for those
seeking instructional certiﬁcates
in, for example, ‘elementary
education,‘ a foreign language
or music. Additionally, there is
g a detailed measurement of the
subject matter that the candidate
will teach, the BTCP report
said_. . « « ' '
Overall, about -5 5 ,OOO tests

V in. 58 areas (56 specialty areas

and 2 core battery tests) were

to just teach the stuff that’s on the
[competency] test, because it’s
not enough and not sufﬁciently
tied to teaching itself to be

I practically useful. On the other

hand, we also would like all of
our students to be certiﬁed to
teach, and that requires passing
these tests.” "

Anotherindicatorofteaching
success is the ability to absorb.
pedagogical strategies, Lesgold
said.

“Science teachers, for exam-
ple, need to learn what are
the dozen,_or so most difﬁcult
concepts in science and what
are some plausible teaching
strategies, for dealing with each
of those. -

“How do we use our knowl-
edge. of how learning works to
help us apply those strategies
effectively with real cases and
real -kids? —That’s the-part that’s
not very much on any exam but
is awfully important.”

Another predictor of teaching
success is an applicant’s own

' philosophy on the profession. ‘

“We pay very careful atten-
tion to an applicant’s statement of
goals,” Lesgold said. “The adrnis—
sion process is fundamentally
an act of integrity on our part
to ensure that people don’t

that that path is going to lead

takers last year, the BTCP report

“Most of this testing stuff is an

intuitively reasonable response

to an entirely legitimate demand
for accountability — by parents,-
by the state, by lawmakers who
give the school funding —- but
it doesn’t always work the way
people intend it,” Lesgold said.
“I think there’s been a" lot
of confusion over this,” he
continued. “People feel thatifwe

the Inclusive Parenting and
Visitation Access Program.

The new initiative will be part ,
of the Fathers Collaborative, a

coordinated, personalized case-
management system overseen
by OCD that provides a variety
of supportive services to non-

nowhere.

“We also come upon cases
where the person’s thinking
about what it is to be teacher
is so diffuse that it’s hard to be
convinced that they’re going
to hold up under what will be
rather strenuous activity,” he
continued.

Candidates entering the
masterof arts in teaching pro-
gram, for example, are facing _a
tortuous schedule just to keep

“They’re going to be taking
a pile of courses, at the same
time they’re going to be working
all year in a school. Sure, the
contract says ‘half—time,’ but
hospital interns have contracts
too and life is about the_same for
the two groups: They’re never

going to have enough time in the a

day, they’re going to be always
tired, they’re going to have a
really strenuous year.

ing that we have enough talent

fails if the restrictions we put on

Even the US. Department
of Education cautions about
reading too much into the Title

off,” the dean added, “it isn’t
responsible to admit them, to
take the tuition, and if they bag
it, say, ‘That’s that.’

“All of the screening we
do is ﬁrst and foremost being
responsible for taking people’s
money in exchange for preparing
them for a career as a teacher.”

Better candidates, Lesgold
said, are those who know early

" that they want to pursue a teach-

ing career and have realistic
goals and expectations.

“We try to talk to a lot of
people early on. I get e—mails
from freshmen: ‘I’ve just been
accepted at Pitt. I really want
to be a teacher, what should I
do?’ That’s exactly the person we
want to respond .to. Help them
work out a plan, put them in
the right position to succeed by

the time they come [to School
of Education graduate pro-
grams].”

_ Lesgold said the education
school’s admissions and advising
staff will go out of their way to
help qualiﬁed candidates who
may lack a particular credential
for admission to an education
program.

“For someone who obviously
should be a teacher, if theythave
some course they should have
taken, we’ll help them get signed
up, even if it’s not at Pitt,”
Lesgold said. “Our advising staff
will help people ﬁgure out how

to pick up those few loose ends
they may need.”

Lesgold also said that more
needs to be done to ensure that
good teachers of all ilks get certi-
ﬁed, including non—traditional
candidates who may decide they
want to teach after being in the
workforce.

“As a society we need to be
able to ﬁnd ways for good people
who are dedicated and caring
and who actually will become
good teachers to get there. You
hate to see screening‘ processes
that essentially force people to go
in lock—step through a sequence
of events or not be allowed to
teach, and of course the state
is trying to avoid that. But
sometimes those things are in
conﬂict.” _

People want the teaching
force to be qualified, ﬁrst and
foremost, Lesgold said. “On
the other hand, we want to
accommodate the person who’s
been a successful engineer or
policeman or electrician and
now wants to become a teacher.
We want to take advantage of the
talent and experience ofsomeone
who maybe didn’t have a 3.0

ed to know Hindi? Serbian? ASL?

University’s Less Commonly Taught
Languages Center probably can help

ngependa kujitundisha
kuongea Kiswahili?
Because if you do -
that is, if you want to learn
to speak Swahili — the place
to do it at Pitt is the Less
Commonly Taught Languages
(LCTL) Center.

The center, part of the linguis— .

"tics department, offers courses

in Swahili and 15 other foreign
languages not available through
Pitt’s other language depart-
ments.

“Less commonly‘ taught”
should not be mis—translated as
“less commonly spoken,” says the
LCTL Center’s acting director,
Dawn McCormick. VVhile some
languages taught through the
center are spoken by fewer than
a million people, primarily in
a single country (Welsh, for
example), others such as Swahili
and Arabic are spoken by tens of
millions worldwide. .

For a variety of reasons
— pedagogic tradition, ethnic
backgrounds of students and

teachers, job opportunities fol-

lowing graduation — foreign
language instruction in the
United States remains Eurocen—
tric, despite increased study of
Chinese and Japanese at some
schools.

So, for example, “German

(spoken by IAOI) rnilliori p€6j5Ie'

‘worldwide, according to the

World Almanac 2002) is com-
monly taught in this country,
from elementar-yschools to
universities. Whereas, Hindi
(with 300 million speakers, the
great majority of them in India)
is rarely. offered in U.S. public
schools. Pitt teaches Hindi
through the LCTL Center.
Thanks to Pitt’s strong area
studies units, some languages that
would be on the linguistic fringe

at other universities are offered ‘

here in the degree programs of
academic departments. Slovak,
for example, is taught here
by the Department of Slavic
Languages and Literatures.
Serbian, however, is taught
through the LCTL Center.

A Another departmental divide
separates teaching of ancient
tongues from modern ones at
Pitt: The classics department
teaches Sanskrit and ancient
Greek, but modern Indian lan-
guages (Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil)
and Greek are offered through
the LCT L Center.

The center’s most popular

    

course isn’t “spoken” at all. About
170 of the 300 students enrolled
in the center’s spring term courses
are studying American Sign
Language (ASL), the center’s
only North American offering.
“The majority of my students
are either looking to, become
teachers of the deaf or speech
pathologists, or they see ASL as

the best option to fulfill their

undergraduate foreign language
requirement,” says ASL instruc-
tor Robin Schmidlin, a 1983 Col-
lege ofA1ts and Sciences graduate
who began studying American

Sign Language through the

LCTL Center.

“Some of my students have

had family members and friends
‘ who were deaf,” Schmidlin adds.
“We’ve ‘had students who have
completely changed their career
paths after taking their first sign
class. It introduced them to the
deaf community and opened up a
whole new culture to them.”
The LCTL Center offers
courses for as few as ﬁve students,
occasionally even fewer, with
peak enrollments of 20 per
section. This term, ' Schmidlin
alone is teaching 32 students
in two sections of ASL. All
are American—born, hearing
students, but Schmidlin says deaf
__students sometimes enroll. 
- “Our students are —motivated
by any number of factors,” says
LCTL Center acting director

McCormick. “Some just want to

fulfill the CAS foreign language
requirementbytakingsomething
other than the usual Spanish,
French or German. Others are
what we call "heritage learners,’
students who want to learn a
language because their parents
or grandparents speak it, or to
otherwise congiect to their ethnic
heritage.” ' ' _

Clayton Wukich, a graduate
student in Pitt’s history depart-
ment, is studying Serbian for

personal as well as academic

reasons: His grandfather is
from the former Yugoslavia, and
Wukich himselfwants eventually
to, earn a doctorate and teach
Eastern European studies.
Wukich studied Slovak in
preparation for an internship
_in Bratislava; he’s also studied
Russian, French and Spanish.
“Of all the languages I’ve taken,
I’ve.retained the most in the
least amount of time studying
Serbian,” Wukich says. He
attributes this to small class sizes

A student practices American Sign Language.

(he’s one of only a half—dozen
students in his Serbian 4 course)
and excellent instruction. “I

“ probably have more personal

motivation, too, because of my
family background,” he says.

Like Wukich, Angela Sanders
is studying a less—commonly-
taught language — Swahili —
both for practical reasons and
because it fascinates her.

A junior majoring in English
writing, Sanders is taking Swahili
2 this term. She plans to earn_ a
teaching certiﬁcate in English
as a Second Language, then
travel and teach in East Africa
following graduate school.

“Structurally, Swahili is more
interesting to me than the other
languages I’ve studied,” says

Sanders, who also studies Spanish -

at Pitt; she took German in high
school. “ Swahili is complicated in
ways I’m not used to, and sim-
pler in other ways. For exam-
ple,_nouns have no gender in

Swahili, unlike in Spanish and

German.” I
Sanders’ Swahili instructor,

"Leonora A. Kivuva, says most of

her studeng have visited Africa
or hope to do so eventually, to
pursue careers or for personal
enrichment. Kivuva, a native of
Kenya, taught 40 students in

graduating seniors. This term,

her Swahili 2 course has 12_

students. , '
Swahili, with 50 million

. speakers, is the most commonly
spoken African language and

the only sub—Saharan African
language currently‘ offered at
Pitt, although the LCTL.Center

sometimes offers, Yoruba. Sur-

_ prisingly, perhaps —,given the

University’s increasing black
student enrollments and the
otential for herit e learners
P “E

in the local African-American"

community + only four of
Kivuva’s current students are
Af_rican—AInericans. “/Generally,
most of my students are not
African—American,” Kivuva says.
“I7rn not sure why. Maybe it is
because they have fewer oppor-
tunities to travel to Africa.”
Among colleges and universi-
ties nationwide, Arabic is the
fastést-growing less—commonly-
taught language, a trend attrib-
uted to heightened ‘academic
interest in Islam and the Middle
East in the wake of the Sept. 11-
terrorist attacks. Because of the
sequence in which Pitt offers
Arabic courses, it’s too early to
tell if the demand for Arabic
will increase here, McCormick
points out. _ -
During spring terms, the
LCTL Center offers one section

I‘ each of Arabic 2 and" Arabic
' 4. Students currently enrolled

in those classes were already
studying Arabic before Sept. 1 1.
The center teaches one section
each of Arabic 1 and 3 in the
fall. ’

“VVhen we see how many
students want to take Arabic 1
next fall, then we’ll know if there
is increased interest as a result of

Sept. 11,” McCormick says. “If

But no mystery of English so
eludes foreigners as the present
perfect "tense, says a veteran
teacher and administrator at Pitt’s
English Language Institute.

“The present perfect -tense

— is really hard for non-English
speakers to grasp, the fact that

when you want- to indicate that

 

said ELI Associa-te Director

Dorolyn A. Smith.

“In other languages, you
would say instead the equivalent
of, ‘Iwas here for three weeks’
or‘I am here for three weeks.’.
In Spanish, you would say, ‘It
makes three weeks that’I am
here.”’ 1

Mike Drazdzinski/‘CIDDE

The present perfect tense
mystiﬁes even speakers of other
Germanic languages, said Smith,

who came to ELI as a graduate *

student in 1982 and joined the‘
facultyin 1986, taking a few
years off during the last two
decades to teach in Germany,
Japan and on Pitt’s,Semester
at Sea shipboard education
program.

“This is not an indisputable

scientiﬁc fact, more a matter of .

what I have observed, ,butI have
found that there are more Ger-
mans, Dutch and Scandinavians
who really master English as a
second language, compared with
other nationalities,” Smith said.
“I think that’s partly because our
languages are closely related, and
partly because of the educational
systems in those countries and
the fact that people in northern
Europe generally assume that
learning another language is no
big deal. '

“Many people in Germany
speak excellent, practically
accentless English. But even
they rarely get the right usage
of the present perfect tense in
English.”

= At least Germans are not
stumped by phrasal, or two-
word, Verbs such as “take out”
and “turnoff” — another feature
of English that mystiﬁes many
foreigners. _

“Just changing the particle
can change the meaning‘ of a

two-word verb completely,’’ ‘

Smith pointed out. “‘Take off’
has a‘ very different meaning
from ‘take on.’ It’s a feature of
Germanic languages that other

Certain English vowel and
consonant sounds are difﬁcult
for foreigners to pronounce:

T ° Besides English, only a
handful of languages (including
Arabic, Greek, and Icelandic)
have the “TH” sound,‘ as in
“thing.” Smith said: “It’s uncom-

mon enough to have ' a single

consonant soundformed by two

- letters. The ‘TH’ sound is really“

uncommon. Even for native
English—‘speaking children, it’s
one of the last sounds.tl"iat

they learn to get right. Most.

foreigners mispronounce it as

Agczi or ¢D_7n

° Koreans and Indonesians

have trouble distinguishing~

between “P”s and “F ”s. “You’ll
hearthem say that some aspect
of English is ‘very dippicult,’’’

‘ said Smith. Similarly, Germans,

Russians and Indians tend to
pronounce “V” as “VV,” and vice-
versa, because their languages
group those sounds differently
than English does, she said.
And Spanish has no distinct “V”
sound. “That’s why our students
from Spanish-speaking countries
say things like: ‘I have problems
with my bowels in English,’

meaning their vowels,” Smith   

said. v , »
° The English “R” sound,

too, is unusual. “Among the

world’s languages, most ‘R’s are

some variant of a trill or a French

‘R,’ not the English ‘R’ that you
hear in the words ‘right’ and
‘wrong,”’ Smith said. -
Outside of Asia, most people
can recognize the English “R”
sound, even if they can’t pro-
nounce it, she said. But East
Asians, besides having difficulty
in pronouncing “R” as well
as “L,” don’t even have those

\\‘

sounds in their languages.
“Quite often,” Smith said,
“students from East Asian coun-
tries can’t hear the difference
between ‘rake’ and ‘lake’” -
hence, the (perhaps apocryphal)

accounts of Japanese supporters '

of Gen. Douglas tMacArthur’s
presidential aspirations declar-
ing: “We play for MacArthur’s
erection.”

English is simpler than many
other languages in at least one
respect, Smith noted: Unlike all
other European languages, the
gender of each noun in English
is determined by meaning, and
does not require a masculine or
feminine article — with a few

' sentimental exceptions, such as
referring to ships and countries
as “she.”

German, in contrast, uses
neuter as well as masculine and
feminine nouns and articles.
Thus, the moon (der Mond)
is masculine and the sun (die
Sonne) is feminine, while a
woman (das Weib), curiously, is
neuter, »a linguistic eccentricity
that prompted Mark Twain to

observe: “In German, a young
lady has no sex, but a turnip
has.’’- i ,.

. U .

As weird as English can be
(“weird” being an exception to
the “I” before “E” except after
“C” rule) cultural forces also
determine how well foreigners
learn to speak and read the
language.

Smithicited the example of
Japanese and Arabic—speaking
ELI students.

Japanese and Arabic both use

.,...dj.£ferent....writi;2g.. .$yS.ts;i_1;1s from 

English, and are about equally
challenging for English-speakers
to learn. Yet, according to Smith,‘
ELI faculty consistently ﬁnd that

Arabic speakers fromithe Middle B

East have a relatively easy time
‘with speaking and listening to

English but lag behind in writing
and reading. '

However, Japanese and other.
East Asians tend to excel in
reading and writing English, but
not 'in conversing. -

“For many Middle Eastern- .

ers, reading and writing tend to
be associated with the Koran,”

Smith said. “There is not so
strong a tradition of reading
for fun. VVhereas, speaking is
a highly valued skill. Being a
good orator_ gets you kudos in
the Middle East.

“The opposite tends to be
true in Japan, where I taught for
a couple of years, as well as in
Korea and, to a lesser extent,
China and Thailand. Students
who come to ELI from those
countries generally learn to read
and write Englishvery well. But
in East Asian cultures, people
who speak glibly are seen as not
being trustworthy. Also, because
of the Confucian concept of
humility, students don’t want to
appear to be showing off, so they
hold back in class.

“It’s the big complaint of
every [ELI] teacher: How do
you get theJapanese to speak up
in class? That’s one reason we
do a lot of instruction in pairs
and small groups, because’ East

‘Asians will speak up in small
groups, but they’re reluctant
to speak in front of the whole
class. Form is very important in
their native countries, where you
hesitate to say anything unless

_ you are absolutely sure you can

say it right.”

“Journalists are among the
least—able language learners”
of the working professionals
who have studied at ELI, Smith
said _ i

“It’s probably because their
personal identities tend to be
based on their ability to be
nuanced and fluent in their own

.languages. It’s hard to leave that
_i.d.en.tity.behind-A . .  *
“When you learn _a foreign
language, you are entering a
new culture and, in manyways,
taking on a new persona,” Smith
pointed out. Dignity must be
i surrendered, as beginners start
off with child—like sentences.

“You cannot discuss philoso-
phy in a language you can barely
speak, so you’re reduced to
mundane, general topics,” Smith

_ said. “It’s especially frustrating

for people like journalists, this
inability to express yourself
verbally in a sophisticated way.”

UPCI studying
new screening
tool for

lung cancer

As one of the deadliest forms
of cancer, lung cancer is often
detected after symptoms have
appeared and long after it has
spread, resulting in a 'five-year
survival rate of only 14 percent.
Whileuadvances in surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation may
increase the length of survival
in patients with advanced dis-
ease, they have not signiﬁcantly
reduced the overall mortality
rate from lung cancer.

Researchers at the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
(UPCI) are examining a technol-
ogy that may allow physicians
to screen high—risk people for
lung cancer before they develop
symptoms of the disease.

The new screening tool, spiral
CT (computed tomography), has
shown promise in early studies
in its ability to detect some types
of small lung tumors that could
possibly grow and result in the
spread of cancer. _ .

Through a large and com-
prehensive study that seeks to
recruit 6,000 smokers and ex-
smokers in the Pittsburgh area

RESERCH NOTES

over the next four years, UPCI
researchers plan to thoroughly
examine the efficacy of spiral CT
as a lung cancer screening tool.
If determined to be an effective
tool, spiral CT could be used in
high—risk populations to discover
and treat lung cancer before
the cancer has had a chance to
spread. . '

“We know that when lung
cancer is found and treated
early, the survival rate improves
substantially. As a result, there
is great need for an -effective
screening tool that we can use
to detect lung cancer earlier
in patients who are at risk for

developing the disease,” saidjoel
Weissfeld, principal investiga-
tor of the study and associate
professor of epidemiology. “This
needis especially crucial in our
community given that nearly
128,000 people in Allegheny
County are at riskfor lung cancer

by virtue of their advanced age“
and cigarette smoking history.” '

During a CT scan, X-ray
beams pass through the chest at
different angles and are processed
by a computer to produce cross.-
sectional images of the entire
area. Using a large machine with
a "hole in the center where a

patient lies on a table, CT is

preferred for diagnosing many
different cancers, including lung
cancer. It allows a physician to
precisely determine the location,
size and extent of a tumor.

Spiral CT scanners have

improved the accuracy of detect-
ing-anodule, or small spot on the
lungs, because they allow images-

I of the lungs to be obtained -in

a single breath hold (usually in
15-20 seconds). This decreases
the chance that a nodule would
be missed due to the respiratory
motion of the lungs during
breathing. A spiral CT scan
results‘ in a faster image with
a lower X-ray dose than a con-
ventional CT scan.

According to Weissfeld, who
also is leader of UPCI’s cancer
epidemiology, prevention and
control program, the current
study is using spiral CT differ-
ently than it commonly has been"
used. ‘ _

“Instead of using spiral CT

to diagnose lung cancer, we will

 . lje’ using itto ,scre,en, forynggules

in the lung, some of whichﬂcoiild
turn out to be cancer, “ Weissfeld
said. ,

“This potentially represents
a better way todetect and cure
lung cancer earlier, but we won’t
know for certain until we conduct
a thorough study to answer
important questions about the
use and efﬁcacy of this technol-
ogy. This study will help us
determine whether spiral. CT
can be used to detect lung cancer

the way mammography is being
used to detect breast cancer.”
The study is a major part of
the recently funded ﬁve-year,
$12 million SPORE (Specialized
Program of Research Excel-
lence) in Lung Cancer from the
National Cancer Institute. The
study is recruiting participants
who are current smokers and
ex—smokers between the ages of
50 and 79. who have smoked for
at least 25 years. In addition to
receiving a CT scan, participants
also will receive a pulmonary

function test. People interested.

undergraduate arts and sciences
curriculum are on the agenda of
a Faculty of Arts and Sciences
meeting scheduled for tomorrow,

discussion of changes in College

Masonic Temple renamed Alumni Hall

at used to be called
the Masonic Temple
is now Alumni Hall.

In voting to rename the Fifth
Avenue building on Feb. 14,
Pitt trustees said the change
recognizes “the devotion, sup-
port and esteem of the University
of Pittsburgh alumni.”

Pitt acquired the Masonic
Temple in 1993 and completed
a $16 million renova-
tion in 2000. Con-
structed in 1915, the
building is a Pitts-
burgh historic land-
mark. ‘

It houses the
alumni relations
office and alumni
center, the admis-
sions and ﬁnancial aid
office, the commu-
nity and governmen-
tal relations office,
the Katz Graduate
School of Business’s
Mellon Financial
Corporation Hall and
the part of the Center
for Instructional De-
velopment and Dis-
tance Education. The

Kuntu Repertory
Theater, among other
campus organiza-

tions, performs in the
building’s seventh-
ﬂoor auditorium.
The new Alumni
Hall is not to be
confused with Pitt’s
Eberly Hall, which
was called Alumni
Hall prior to being
renamed in Septem-

ber 1998 in recognition of the
Eberly farr1ily’s long-time ﬁnan-
cial support of the University.

Also at the Board of Trust-
ees’ winter meeting, the board
adopted a revised method for
electing alumni trustees — over
the objections of alumnitrustee
Woody Turner.

Under the new process, two
of the board’s six alumni trustees

Research Position

will be the two immediate past
presidents of the Pitt Alumni
Association. The remaining four
will be nominated by the Board of
Trustees’ nominating committee
from candidates identiﬁed by
that committee and the alumni
association’s nominating com-
mittee.

Turner, the only trustee
who voted against the change,

protested that it took away the
alumni association’s traditional
prerogative of nominating all six
alumni trustees. VVhile noting ~
that the alumni association’s exec-
utive committee had endorsed
the new election process, Turner
said: “I submit to you that
the alumni association board
of directors hasn’t even been
informed of this proposed
change, let alone had a majority
vote in favor of it.”

Turner, a former alumni
association president, pleaded
unsuccessfully with his fellow
Pitt trustees to delay voting on
the new procedure until after the
March 2 meeting of the alumni
association’s board. “It’s very nice
to rename the Masonic Temple
as Alumni Hall,” Turner said,
“but it also would be nice to slow
things down to give the alumni
association’s board and this [Pitt]
board a better opportunity to
discuss this change.”

Current alumni association
president Sam Zacharias, Pitt
trustees chairperson ~William
Dietrich and Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg all said the new
process was intended to “spread
the net” in recruiting alumni
trustees and to foster greater col-
laboration between the non1inat—
ing committees of the alumni
association and Pitt’s board.

I Association leaders and Pitt
trustees discussed the change
“at great length,” Dietrich said,
while Nordenberg noted that the

trustees’. nominating c.o.mmittee.—.11.-.

always has had the power to
accept or reject alumni trustee
candidates proposed by the
alumni association. _
Under the new process, the
association’s nominating com-
mittee “will continue to have as
much input into the selection
process for the six nominees as
it always has had,” Zacharias
said. ‘
