Jazz concert united innovators

NIKKI SCHWAB
Staff Writer

In 1970, Nathan Davis, head of Pitfs
Jazz Studies, founded an  seminar and
concert to bring well-known jazz talents to
Pitt to teach and perfonn for students.

This year, the 33rd seminar and concert
took place Oct 28 through Nov. 2. It featured
a concert with a montage of jazz greats.
Along with seminars and lectures, a jazz
exhibition and an outreach program to area
schools and community centers took place.

The Saturday evening concert, which
sold out the Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland,
featured saxophonists Davis, James Moody
and Jackie McLean; trumpet players Jon
Faddis and Randy Brecker; electric bassist
Abraham Laboriel; pianist Mulgrew Miller;

guitarist Pat Martino; and drummer Billy H

Cobham.

According to Davis, the concert was so
distinguished because all the players were
innovators, and the group had never played
together before — and may never asserrrble
again. _

“Each of the musicians that are invited
are handpicked. They are each leaders in
their own right, and now they come together
to form an all-star group,” Davis said. “In a
lot of other programs, they just invite a
ban 

Legendary trumpeter Clark Teny per-
formed and was honored With a lifetime

achievement award during the concert.
Davis said Teny inﬂuenced every trum-
pet player there is, including Miles Davis.
“He was sitting in a wheelchair and he
was playing his ass 0 ,” said Davis, a pro-
fessor at Pitt. “It just shows you the spirit that
was there.”
Also annourfced at the concert were this

ans,critics and musicians from- all over the
globe chose to induct bandleader Fletcher
Henderson, saxophonist Zoot Sims and
pianistHankJones. ‘

The seminars and lectures, held earlier in '

the week, were open to Pitt students and were
audio recorded and videotaped, to be added
to the jazz archives that have been collected
over the past 32 years.

“We might have one of the best.collec—
tions in the world,” Davis said. '

An exhibition, featuring a Leedy Xylo-
phone once owned by Lionel Hampton and

other memorabilia, such as Mary Lou

Williams’ piano, was on display throughout
the week in the Conney M. Kimbo Gallery.

Pitt jazz. students were able to perform
alongside ' the jazz musicians at various
schools and charities throughout the commu-
nity. The outreach program included concerts
at the Pittsburgh High School for the Creative
and Performing Arts, the Falk Laboratory
School, the Ronald McDonald House and
the Afro-American Music Institute.

Important traditions remembered

PolishFest, page 1

Chocolate peanut butter balls and lemon
cookies were just some of the sweets avail-
able.

And for those who weren’t into sweets,
there were many varieties of baked bread,
too. .

Anyonewho came to hear traditional
music was not disappointed, as Polish music
was always playing, either from recordings
or in a live performance. .

Florence Kozlowski, who perform
traditional music with the accordion, knows
ﬂue value of keeping traditions.

‘Traditions are what count, and that’s
what you pass on to your children,”

\

Kozlowski said. . A

“You have to respect each other’s eth-
nicity,” she added. ‘ A

Kozlowski also attributed the success of
the event to a few altruistic people.

“It is a success because of the help of a

few” Kozlowski said. “It was a truly cooper— .

ative eﬁort.” _

There were also many reminders of a
Polish holiday, St. Nicholas Day, as a tradi-
tionally dressed St. Nicholas roamed the
crowds, reminding people what to do for the
holiday. ’

“Remember to put your shoes out on
Dec. 6,” he said. “You will get candy only if

you were ‘good. If you were bad, all you will
 get is coal, and you have no use for coal.” _ 1

Contract beats expectations A T

SEIU, page 1

years ago, SEIU accepted a lower wage for
the janitors at the Mellon Service Center “in
a moment of weakness,” and that janitors

_ also receive pay below the standard rate in

other buildings, including PNC Bank
Firstside Center. 1
Anthony Faino, a Pitt senior and SIS
member who attended’ several of SEIU’s
Justice for Janitors ﬁmctions, admitted he
was shocked at the outcome of the .negotia-
tions. ‘ A
. “l ﬁgured the contractors would oﬂ’er
more than they offered before the contract
went up, but I didn’t think they would offer
as much as they did,” he said. ‘

T Faino added that, although he thinks the
janitors should be paid even more and have
full family health care, the new contract is
the ‘best they could have gotten. _ _

‘‘They’re the third highest paid janitors
in the country right now,” he added.

EDITORIAL

A day to reﬂect on the sacrifices of others‘

Today is Veterans Day.
For schoolchildren, it’s a day

off. It’s a day without mail or trash

pickup, and a day without liquor,

unless" you’ve stocked up or decide

to hit a bar. _ _ ,

It’s one more day of sales at the
mall, more consumerist salvos
lobbed right at the pocketbooks of
America.

It shouldn’t be just one more
useless date on the calendar. It’s
more important than Arbor Day or

g Groundhog Day or Secretaries Day.

It’s not just another creation of
Hallmark.

Divorce yourself from your per-
sonalpolitics today. Set aside your
View of the current conﬂict in Iraq.
Forget where you . stood on
Vietnam. V A

‘ Today is about pausing to
remember human beings who. put
their lives on the line for us. Today
is about recognizing men and
women who answered their coun-
try’s call.

, Veterans Day is less about poli-
tics‘ orpatriotism and more about
honoring ‘sacrifices made by our
fellow citizens and acknowledging
their service on our behalf. The hol-
iday is not even fully about
America. Our allies throughout his-
tory must not be forgotten, either.

Young people have served and died
for this country. Young people are
overseas now, fighting. We should-

Veterans make up our families and
our communities.
veterans every day, and they rarely
get recognition.

There is a parade Downtown at
10:30 a.m. If you can’t make it, find
some other way to acknowledge
veterans. Many institutions observe
a moment, of silence at 11:11 a.m.
Flying a ﬂag is always appropriate,
as is wearing a flag pin or yellow
ribbon. Give Grandpa a call, if he
served and you spent a lot of your
childhood rolling your eyes at his

such, the Pitt production does not

Missing the places that used to call Oalnd hoe

:.~u—-_-,—u-~ » ---~

About six years ago, I was a bright-eyed,
innocent teenager growing up in the _sub—
urbs of Pittsburgh. Trips into the city
were sporadic, but they almost
always included a stop in Oakland g
for one reason or another.

The Oakland we know today is far
different than the one I visited just over a
half a decade ago. I’m not talking about
just the loss of Pitt Stadium, changing
the name of Forbes Quadrangle to Wesley
W. Posvar Hall, the arrival of Bouquet
Gardens or the construction of Sennott
Square. »

I’m talking about the culture of
Oakland, about the loss of independent
stores that were a staple of the neighbor-
hood — the places that made Oakland Oakland.

We recently lost Bovvers, the shoe store that
was, for a long time, Pittsburgh’s place to get Dr.
Martens. Before buying things online was as

, easy as point, click and go, Bovvers was the only

place around I could go to search out a pair of
hot-pink Docs.

I can remember walking down Forbes
Avenue one November night all those years ago
and seeing that “The Big Lebowski” was playing
at the Beehive in the King’s Court building —
which closed its doors in May 2001. Since then,

it has been empty and, despite opening up for

one night last spring to host Oakland’s Flux
event, it still remains for sale.

I’m not encouraging underage drinking, but
C.J. B_arney’s was the best place to be if you did-

n’t possess a fake ID. Where
2 is it now? As aresult of one
too many raids by the Liquor
Control Board, C.J.’s was
forced to close their doors for
the last time. in February,
-2001. After’ standing vacant
for two years, it is only now
that another business is mov-
ing in — an 18-and-over estab-
lishment.

There is talk of closing
Club Laga ancl._.turning the
space into apartments. With the
loss of Metropol already, and the
impending loss of Project 1877,
this is just ridiculous. Of course,
Oakland needs more apartments, but it shouldn’t
come at the sacrifice of a great live music venue.
Why don’t they knock down some of the nearly
condemned apartments that students are forced
to live in now and replace them with multi-story
apartment buildings. ,

" And now, probably the hardest-hitting blow
to Oakland’s uniqueness is the closing of Tela
Ropa. The store that embodies the peace-love-
and-harmony theme has fallen victim to Bush’s
damn Operation Pipe Dreams. Due to the hefty
finesthe store had to pay as a result of last win-
ter’s paraphernalia bust, the store is going out 0
business. « -

Tela Ropa carried items that you had a hard
time finding elsewhere — some of my favorite

posters and T-shirts were purchased at Tela

Ropa,» and high school friends begged to know
where I found them. Tela Ropa was where my
roommate from freshman year and Iywent to get

’tie—dyed tapestries tofreplace. the dull, lifeless
white curtains-that were our “‘c1’osets.»” ‘It had. one

of the best candle and.incens_e selections around,

and the staff wasalways "extremely niceand

helpful. ‘ ‘ .

And then there was‘ the obvious perk of hav-
ing a place like Tela Ropa around —— what would
become itsdemise, however —— their selection of

pipes, bongs and bowls. For smoking tobacco, of A

course. _ _  .~ ,-

While we‘ still have at least the remainder of
November to take advantage of their going-out-
of-business sale, things just_won’t be.the same
when it’s gone. ’ ,

Sure, we can hop online and purchase the
exact same things that, Tela Ropa carried, but
we’re going to have to do it with a wait, and
shipping and handling fees. We’re going to have
t_o walk by that stupid'Cricket store knowing that
the space above it is vacant; that one of the most
eclectic shops Oakland ever had has been closed
down for stupid fines.

While nothing can be done to ‘bring back Tela
Ropa, C.J. Barney’s and Bovvers, we can only
hope that the buck will stop here.

In the meantime, take advantage of Club
Laga and places like The Original Hot Dog Shop,

Dave and Andy’s, Dave’s Music Mine, Kiva Han V

and Peter’s Pub. You never know when some-
thing ridiculous is going to cause them to disap-
pear. _ , ~

big in Pitt victory

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

Chris Taft is tough. Or so his team-
mate, Pitt forward Chevon Troutman,
says.

. “He’s all raw talent,” Troutman said
of Taft’s performance in Pitt’s 82-56
exhibition win over the EA Sports All-
Stars on Sunday. “I really think that he’s
going to be a big—time player for Pitt.”

Taft, a 6—foot-10-inch freshman
from Brooklyn, N.Y., ﬁnished with 10
points, three rebounds and two blocks
in only 17 minutes of play coming off

‘ the bench.

“[Taft’s] getting better each day,”
coach Jamie Dixon said. “He’s really
picking things up quickly.”

Four other Panthers ﬁnished with
double-digits in scoring as Pitt rolled
over the All-Stars.

Troutman‘ led the Panthers in scor-
ing and rebounding with 15 points and
nine rebounds, four of which were on
offense.

Guard Carl Krauser ﬁnished the
game with two three-pointers and a total

of 14 points.

Krauser also racked up a game-high
nine assists, including a behind the back
feed to Yuri Demetris with 16 minutes,
35 seconds left in the second half.

“Yuri’s so versatile,” Dixon said. “I
think he did a great job ﬁlling in for
[J aron Brown] today.”

“He does a lot of things that don’t
show up in the scorebook.”

Brown missed the game with ten-
dinitis, but Dixon said he would be able
to play in Friday’s season opener
against Alabama, at Madison Square
Garden.

The Panthers took a 29-point lead
into halftime, shooting just shy of 60
percent with six three-pointers in the
first half.

Forward Julius Page amassed three
baskets from behind the arc, leading all
Pitt scorers. But all three came for Page
in the first half, as Page finished with 12
points.

“As the game went on, my legs
started getting tired,” Page said. “I felt

Panthers prepare to avengeloss to West Virginia

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

Draped across aiwall in the weight
room in the Panthers’ practice facility is
a banner that reads “11—15-03.”

It’s been there all season and is a
perfect illustration of just how big of a
rivalry the Backyard Brawl really is. It
is safe to assume that the Panthers will
be fired up for Saturday’s game against
West Virginia.

Although Walt Harris is known for
keeping’ an even keel and taking one
game at a time, this is no ordinary
game. ‘

“They’re our biggest rival. It’s an
exciting game for both universities to
play in the Backyard Brawl. This will
be my seventh, and I’ve had some vivid
memories of some all—time highs and
some all—time lows,” Harris said. “Last
year was one of the all-time lows. It was
a heck of a game between two good

teams, but one found a way to beat
themselves, and one found a way to win
the game. We didn’t get the job done,
and that’s why we want to constantly
remind our football players the impor-
tance of that date and this game.”

, Senior, defensive back William
“Tutu” Ferguson knows that this is a big
game every year, no matter what the
circumstances are. Ferguson sees the
barmer as a reminder of just how much
the Backyard Brawl means. ,

“When you play the team that
you’re a rival against, man, you throw
the records out the window,” Ferguson
said, “Both teams are going to play hard
and play to the end. Putting that banner
up in the weight room is just a sign to
reiterate to everybody_ that this is a big
game.”

The Panthers are coming off a hard-
fought, emotional victory against
Virginia Tech. It was a game in which
the Pitt defense was able to dig deep

t.-.«\.,.‘n,.-K--o ..... ..v-».._--1.,—...4m ,.-- -...~...».,4> —-~— --~- -»»-- .. .. —. - »— - A

and come up with a huge stop late in the
fourthquarter. Harris was proud of the
way his team was able to respond in the
fourth quarter and said that when the
game was on the line, the players per-
formed.

“Our guys played their hearts out,”
Harris said. “We found a way to win.
They’ve got tremendous talent, but our
guys got it done when they needed to.”

This week, all Pitt practices will be
closed to the media. It is a move that

Harris says will help the coaches and_

players concentrate on getting the job
done.

“We’ve had a focused football team
the last four weeks. It’s a real big game
to us, and our guys seem to focus better
when there’s not a lot of distractions,”
Harris said. “We tried to reduce the
number of things that we focus on as a
coaching staff with our players. We see
[closing practice to the media as] being
helpful to us in our preparation. We

want to keep our eye on the bull’s-eye.”

. West Virginia plays an unconven-
tional style of football on both sides of
the ball. The Mountaineers effectively
run the no-huddle offense, which is the
same style of offense Toledo used to
confuse Pitt’s defense.

Harris is also worried about match-
ing up with West Virginia’s talented
offensive line. He said that their size
and athletic ability make it difficult to
come up with defensive schemes.

“[West Virginia’s offensive line]
does a real good job of blocking,”
Harris said. “They’re well-coached,
they’re very well-disciplined on their
footwork, and they do a real good job of
attacking your schemes. They dominat-
ed Virginia Tech up front.”

Defensively, the Mountaineers are
one of the only Division I teams that
line up with three linemen, five line-

Panther fans behave with class after upset, unlike WVU fans
 

Forget about West Virginia this
weekend. Pitt fans have already beat
them. The fans showed them exact-
ly why Pitt is better than West
Virginia. ‘

You see, after an upset victory
over No. 5 Virginia Tech, Pitt fans
did not storm the field and get
sprayed with mace in an attempt to
tear down a goalpost or two. They
did not go back to Oakland and set
things on fire. Pitt did not have a
large amount of students arrested
for disorderly activity.

When sitting in the press box,
watching the crowd of 66,000 plus
Panther fans going crazy, waving

those free towels, I envisioned them
storming the field and tearing down

the goalposts and mayhem ensuing,»

but I have to say, I’m quite proud of
what I saw.

Yeah, there were a few idiots
who jumped — I counted five —-
and they were all arrested right

away. Including the lone fan who
felt the need to jump on the field
near the open end of Heinz Field’
and trek about 80 yards just to pat a
Panther player on the back.
Congrats to you, my friend. I hope it
was worth it — 20 dollars for sea-
son tickets, couple hundred for that
pat on the back, and worst of all,
your 15 seconds of fame are coming
from me, and I’m making fun of
you. .
Still, barring the few incidents, I
was happy to see Panther fans
scream and yell and, most of all,
behave. I was happy to go home and
turn on the television and see high-

Rutherford throwing crisp passes to
receiver Larry Fitzgerald, and full-
back Lousaka Polite powering his
way into the end zone for the win-

"ning touchdown. They were just

football highlights. There was no
footage of studentfoolery, which
seems to occur during every upset,
or even near upset, that takes place
just an hour south of us.

In West Virginia’s upset victory
over Virginia Tech on Oct. 22, fans
stormed the field and tried to tear
down goalposts, but they were met
by police and mace. ’ A

Several students "took to the
street and set numerous fires. The
fire department reportedly put out
over 100 fires after the game, and at
least 40 students are being disci-

plined for their actions that evening.
“Somewhere on TV, I heard that

in the last seven years,-WVU has
had 900 fires and this year. has
brought about 150 so far,” Vice
President, of Student Affairs at West
Virginia Ken‘Gray.said in an article
in The Daily Athenaeum.

This kind of conduct is just
insane. I must‘ be honest and say

that I used to be one of the ones who

dreamed of jumping on the field
after an upset, win and pulling down
a goalpost. But my views changed
last year when I was watching
ESPN’s SportsCenter. They aired a

' . segment talking about students who

had been seriously injured during

these upset victory celebrations.
Students like Andrew Bourne, of

Ball State, who was standing in the

end zone celebrating a Homecoming,

upset win over Toledo on Oct. 20,
2001. His celebration came to ‘a

quick end when the goalpost came

crashing down and hit him on the
back. As result, he was paralyzed
from the waist down. ‘

There have been plenty of other
devastating injuries caused by these
celebrations, which is why I do not
condone storming the field any-
more. "

Don’t get me wrong. I’m still a
huge football fan, but you won’t
find me hanging ora goalpost,
burning my couch or being chased
by Pittsburgh’s finest.

You will find me cheering on.

Saturdays for the Panthers’ victories
and gloating when Penn State loses.
And you will find me saluting all
you Panther fans who chose to cele-
brate ina way that makes Pitt better
than West Virginia. ‘

“[The] best thing about us was the
improvement we made from the last'exhi-
bition game,” Dixon said. “I was pretty

pleased with the effort, especially from,

Carl Krauser.”

Although Pitt’s starting lineup current-
ly features ﬁve upperclassmen, its bench
holds eight freshmen.

Troutman asserted, however, that his
teammates already have a feel for one
another. . . pp

“Our chemistry isn’t there yet, but it’s
definitely improving everyday in prac-
tice,” he_ said.

Dixon said that he is expecting

Alabama to be an athletic team.

“We know their coach and we know.

what kind of stuff they’ve run in the
past,” he added. “We’ve been watching
ﬁlm all summer.”

All in all, Dixon ‘delighted in his -

team’s performance against the All-Stars.

that we emphasized a couple things in
[practice] and the guys responded,” he
said. “[They] took the one, being

ﬁeld—goal percentages, and we [reduced
them], especially early on.” i

. Pitt fmished with -13 tumovers while I
the A11—Stars shot 33.3 percent, and 20.8

percent from behind the three-point line,
in the losing effort. _

The Panthers are next in action on
Nov. 14' in the Coaches vs. Cancer
Classic at Madison Square Garden in
New York. Pitt will take on Alabama at 7
p.m. and the game will be televised on

backers, and three defensive backs.
Five linebackers swarming around the
opposing ball carrier make running the
ball a challenge. And attacking through
the air is difficult because of the way

the linebackers can drop into zone cov- ’

erage underneath, with the three defen-
- sive backs taking away -the deep pass.

“It’s a really tough defense to try to"

attack, and I don’t think anyone has ﬁg-
ured out any consistent plays,” Harris
said. “We’ve‘not seen anyone consis-
tently do anything against them, other
than have to punt.” ,

As Pitt prepares for West Virginia
behind closed doors this week, the
emphasis will be on focus and concen-
tration. Harris knows that this is a game
that neither team can afford to lose.
