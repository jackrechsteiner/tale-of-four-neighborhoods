I Pitt Pathﬁnders. '

Often seen giving tours to packs of
curious high school students and their con-

sentatives of the Pitt community. In C—Side
Cafeteria, the Cathedral of Learning and

_ Towers lobby, among other locations, they

devote their time and energy ,_to’ helping
guide high school students through the col‘-

lege selection process and promoting the _
 experience. .

‘Working’ under the University Oﬂice
of Admissions and Financial Aid, the
Pathﬁnders do more than provide tours.

conferences where incoming freshmen and

‘undecided college-bound. seniors get the

the Pathﬁnders, allow high school seniors

“I like giving tours because I love con-

Staff Writer

No one ever said college life
would be easy. Sure, there are bound
to be lot of good times, but there’s
also a lot of stress. Classes are hard,
and many students experience living
away from home for the first time.

To help students through rough
times, Pitt has its own Counseling
Center.

All students are encouraged to
meet at any time with a professional
counselor, free of charge, to talk
through any difficulties and find
better strategies for dealing with
life’s curve balls.

According to counselor Teddy
Wilkes, mental health issues,
depression in particular, affect many
students.

“Depression is most likely to
first occur during a major life tran-
sition,” Wilkes said. “There’s a
myriad of issues caught up in
depression such as searching for
identity and fear of how peers view
you, issues every student goes
through in college. There are all part

of a person’s normal development, ‘

but sometimes you can stuck in a
phase of development. And then
therapy can be helpful to get a per-
son back on track.” ‘

The Counseling Center offers
three techniques to help‘ students.
The first is individual therapy, in
which a student meets one-on—one
with a counselor to discuss issues.

First meetings are usually a feeling-
out period, so both the counselor
and the student get to know one
another before working on deeper
problems.

Second, the Counseling Center
offers group therapy sessions. In
this type of therapy, a counselor
meets with a group of students, who
talk about their individual problems
and offer suggestions and support to
one another.

The Counseling Center also pro-
vides ‘treatment -
to students with
chronic problems
and can prescribe ,

medication if
necessary.
F i n a l 1 y ,

because careers
and majors are
such a significant
cause of stress in
many students’
lives, the
C o u n s e 1 i n g
Center is aligned
with Placement
and Career
Services. Career
‘counselors offer
advice and sup-
port in many
ways, from ‘help-

Pitt offers an Internet connection, computers and classes to make sense of it all

DAVE HARTMAN

Contributing Editor

You have 900 sheets to go.

That works out to 1,800 pages, if
you print front and back.

It’s, your print quota in the
University computer labs this semester,
and if you use it wisely, you can do a lot
of damage with 900 pieces of paper at
your disposal.

Because you’ve registered as a stu-
dent at Pitt, computing services auto-
matically created an account, and prob-
ably already notiﬁed you of your very
own “@pitt.edu” e-mail address, which
is prefaced by a username consisting of
your initials and a number. A password
was also generated for your account —
but fear not — you can change that
password as soon and as often as you
like.

You now have free access to any of
Pitt’s six campus computer 1abs,‘which
house more than 600 computers. And
you still have 900 sheets to go. It’s time
to start working on that.

Some students are lucky enough to
have a computer in their dorm rooms,
and enjoy the beneﬁts of a lightning-fast
100-megabit-per-second ethemet con-
nection to the Internet. But for students
who aren’t fortunate enough to own a
computer, or for those who need access
to a scarmer or any number of software
programs, Pitt’s computer labs offer-the
same high-speed access.

Computer access is available some-
where on campus 24 hours a day, but the
labs can get crowded, so it’s a good idea
to check a few different labs at different
hours of the day. _

Once you’ve found a lab, sit down
at an available computer, enter your
usemame and password, and begin to
explore the programs and Internet sites
to which the computer provides access.

For starters, you can check out
www.pitt.edu/technology.html, which
provides information about the comput-
er labs, your account, the software avail-
able to you —— both for use in the lab or
as a free software package that you can
pick up to put on your personal comput-
er — and anything even remotely relat-
ed to operating a computer at the
University.

There's no need to print all of this
information, but just in case you should

want to, click on “print” and wait until a ’

computerlab employee brings out the
pile of recently-printed documents.
Each printed document comes with a
cover sheet that lists the usemame of the
student who printed it. The cover sheets
are color coded to reﬂect the day the

document was printed, so if there’s a

print backup, you can always come back
later to pick up your papers.
You have 754 sheets to go.
University computers come
equipped, with dozens of programs,

from the standard Microsoft Word fare.
to more complicated programs such as

Mathematica. Type a paper for class,
compile statistical information on a
spreadsheet or design a Web page, all in
the comfort of a plush swivel chair. Be
sure to allow at least a couple extra min-
utes to print your work, pick up the doc-
uments and notice your new print quota.

“Only 712 left.

The advent of e-mail has missed
few adolescents, but in case you’re new

to the game of electronic messaging, be‘

prepared to begin checking your Pitt
account at least every few days. Many
professors use e-mail to send pertinent
class information. or establish a rapport
with students.

But all work and no play makes for .

a dull college career.
So be sure to let your friends and

family know about your new address‘; -

Or if you’re attached to your current e-
mail account, you can forward all of
your Pitt e-mail to another address.

But regardless of where you read
your messages, you’ll find that a free
Internet connection can allow you to
keep in touch while maintaining a
respectably low phone bill. Of course, if
you’d like to check on that phone-bill,

on-campus students can visit
www.acus.com. ‘
Print your

phone bill. Print
your professor’s e-
mails about the
upcoming test, and
print all of the real-
ly good e-mails

Ofﬁce, Pitt sells advanced computer
programs at reduced prices. Those are
also available at most computer labs.
As technology continues to change,"
the University works to keep up.
Consequently, one-third of all comput-
ers in Pitt labs are replaced every year.
, And though the -machines seem to

become more user-friendly every"

minute, Pitt offers classes for those who
are lost in the changing technological
world. .
’ Quickstart classes are free, one- to
three-hour classes that are held in cam-
pus labs on weekdays. The classes
change based on the students’ interests,
which are gauged through an online reg-
istration process. The classes aren’t
graded and are non-credit, but are
offered each term to students who want
to further their knowledge of computers.

Friends will probably serve as the ’

best teachers when it comes to other
activities such as downloading mp3s.
The music ﬁles, which allow computer
users to listen to songs that are stored on
the hard drive, have stirred controversy
at others schools, but will remain avail-
able. on Pitt’s network. '

SUMMER, 2001

MELISSA DANEK

., Contributing Editor

Immersed in the excitement sur-
rounding the ﬁrst year of college, stu-
dents may be preoccupied with picking
meal plans and making new friends.
But that doesn’t mean they should
ignore the importance of the ﬁnancial
aid process. -

By now, all students — incoming
freshmen and continuing students alike
-4 should have submitted their Free
Application for Federal Student Aid
and the University’s Financial Aid
Application Supplement.

The U.S. Department of Education
uses a formula that considers factors
such as total income, federal taxes‘ paid,
family size and the number of family
members in college to determine each
student’s financial aid awards.

The University uses the informa-
tion compiled by the Department of
Education to determine a student’s
financial need. Financial need is the
difference between the actual cost of
attending college and what the stu-
dent’s family is expected to contribute
toward an education. Financial need
determines aid awards from certain

programs. -

After the University determines
what types and amounts of aid to offer,
the student receives a financial aid
award letter. Incoming freshmen should
receive this letter soon if they have not
already.

Based on that letter, the student will
need to return the aid offer response
card to the University, as well as com-
plete any promissory notes or partici-
pate in any interviews necessary for
federal loan programs such as Perkins
and Stafford.

The four major types of aid are
scholarships, grants, loans and work-
study. .
Scholarships do not have to be
repaid by the student. They are often
awarded for academic achievements or
special talents that students demon-
strate. Most students who are awarded
an academic scholarship by the
University will need to meet certain
grade and enrollment criteria to renew
the scholarship. The UniVersity’s' Web
site, www.pitt.edu/~oafa, offers a list-
ing of scholarships with qualiﬁcations
and award amounts.

Grants, like scholarships, do not
have to be repaid by the student. But in
contrast to scholarships, most grants

are awarded based on a student’s ﬁnan-
cial need. Grants can be awarded by the
state and federal governments as well
as by the University. _
Loans are issued by government
programs and by private lenders to
assist students in meeting the costs of
higher education. Loans must be
repaid. While terms vary accordingto
the type of loan and who issues it, cer-
tain loans may stipulate that students
must maintain full- 5
time status‘ (at least
l2 credits). Other
types of aid may
also be affected if
the student’s
cumulative GPA
falls below a cer-

students work a maximum of 20 hours
per week during the academic year,
with the federal government paying up
to 60 percent of the students’ salaries.

If the amount of financial aid
offered by the University is not as
much as a student was expecting, he or
she can" look into loans from private
lenders or tuition payments as solu-
tions.

student falls below full-time status.

Work-study is a federal program
that allows students to earn part of their
financial aid through part-time jobs
within the University. Students who are
offered and accept'work—study aid are
responsible for finding jobs on campus
and negotiating the terms of employ-
ment with their employers.

A list of jobs is made available in
the fall through the ﬁnancial aid Web
site. Under the terms of this program,

; “Students and
parents really need to read everything
we send them,” she said. '

McCulloch V added that students
should keep copies of all forms and get
the names and phone numbers of peo-
ple they contact about their ﬁnancial
aid.

‘ Additional and more detailed infor-
mation can be obtained by calling or
writing the Ofﬁce of Admissions and
Financial Aid, and is also available on
the Web site. '

department at the Semester at Sea ofﬁce.
According to Byme, the voyage is only
marginally more expensive than Pitt’s

The standard
cost without a work-

$13,750 for the fall

Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and Israel.
A range of courses are offered, such

countries that are visited from the
Department of State and voyages are

about potential safety and health con-
cems.

“It’s a learning and growing opportu-
nity that you would never be able to ﬁnd

outside of college,” Byme said. “[You

can] visit three diﬂerent continents and

eight to‘ nine different cultures in 100 days '

during the fall and spring, 65 days in the
summer.” . - _ V

The Study Abroad Ofﬁce supplies
students with information on how to,pur-
sue an educational experience for one or
two semesters almost -anywhere in the
world. Some of the more popular places

to study abroad include England,

Australia and Japan.

According to Elizabeth Royal, an
adviser in the Study Abroad Ofﬁce, over
600 Pitt students study abroad each year.

“My study abroad experience in India
has been the most beneﬁcial part of my
education so far at Pitt,” said Nicole
Kelley, ajunior who attended.Pitt in India,
a summer study abroad program in the
city of Hyderabad.

“The daily experience of interacting
with Indian people was just incredible,”
she said. “I felt like  made a connection
with everyone who I came into contact
with. My experience in India really awoke
my senses and made me feel more alive.”

Although there are over 100 pro-
grams that cost approximately the same as
Pitt’s room and board and tuition,‘ most
programs cost more The price varies per

 program. Typically, students’ ﬁnancial aid

will transfer, ' except‘ for Work-study‘

grants.

Students are encouraged to apply for

study abroad one year before they intend
to‘ go. Freshmen are not eligible. to study
abroad, but are encouraged to apply as

’ soon as possible for their sophomore year.

“Freshmen should be coming up as
soon as they get here,” Royal said. ' '
Students must be in good academic

standing to be eligible. Usually a student 7

must maintain a 2.75'GPA, although the

requirements differ between the different ‘ V_
on campus. 
Engineers, for example, are required to ‘

colleges and - schools

maintain a-2.5 QPA. Knowledge of a for-

eign, language is encouraged but not‘

required for-most programs.

After a student applies to study
abroad, he or she must attend meetings to
get credits approved. They must also go
over safety and health information, travel
insurance and any information speciﬁc to
the destination. VV1th the approval of cred-
its, courses taken" abroad count at Pitt

ture requirements simply by studying p

abroad.

Whether they’re looking for
Chinese food, a home-style meal or a
frozen yogurt sundae, students can
find the perfect place to satisfy their
hunger, right here on campus.

Pitt’s five main cafeterias
Eddie’s, C-Side Cafeteria, Schenley
Cafe, Cathedral Cafe and Sutherland
Cafeteria —— offer a variety of foods,
including those that satisfy students’
special dietary needs.

Eddie’s and C-Side are both locat-
ed in the basement of the Towers,
while Schenley Cafe is in the basement
of the William Pitt Union. The
Cathedral - Cafe and Sutherland
Cafeteria are housed in their respective
namesake buildings.

Students with meal plans can pur-
chase food a la carte at Eddie’s and
Schenley Cafe with meal blocks and
dining dollars. Only dining dollars are
accepted , at Cathedral ' Cafe.
Particularly hungry folks can indulge
in an all-you-can-eat meal at C-Side or
Sutherland Cafe for one meal block or
the equivalent in dining dollars, $4.85.

Pitt’s food service provider,
Sodexho Marriott, strives to continue
the quality and consistency of their
services. Betsy Sallade-Farina, direc-
tor of food services, urged students to
voice their concerns and suggestions. ‘

More than 11 campus libraries meet students’ research needs

CHARLOTTE TUCKER

Contributing Editor

The -Internet truly ‘does put the

A world at our fingertips,’ but some-
. times even the most Web savvy stu-

dent must venture from his or her

_ room and go to the library.

L But where should you start? Pitt
has more than 11 libraries, each
serving a distinct purpose, so here’s

a guide to the stacks across Pitt’s

campus.‘

The largest library on campus is
Hillman Library, located at 3960
Forbes Ave. Hillman is home to
more than 1.5 million -volumes, 200
computersand lots of quiet corners
for studying, spread throughout the
five floors. .

Hillman focuses primarily on
the humanities and social sciences,
and-has numerous special collec-
tions in topics ranging from social
work to East Asian studies. If

you’re not sure where to find some- _

thing, the people at the ground ﬂoor
information desk_should point you
in the right direction. ' .
The ground ﬂoor of Hillman is
also where 'you’ll find the library’s
latest renovation, a Starbucks coffee
shop playfully nicknamed Cup_,and
Chaucer. The cafe is also home to, a

detailed illustrated replica of
Geoffrey Chaucer’s “Canterbury
Tales.’.’, _

Science students, though, will
have little luck at Hillman, and
should instead lookin libraries
geared toward more specific "stud-
16S. -

_ Engineers will want tolhead to
the Bevier Engineering Library in

.126 Benedumi Hall. With 65,000

books and more than 1,000 journal
titles, engineers in every concentra-
tion should be able to find what
they’re looking for here.

While the engineers do their
research in Benedum, physicists and
astronomers can go to 208 Old
Engineering Hall to find more than
41,000 books and 340 subscriptions.

, Chemists and computer scien-'
tists can do their research in 200

Eberly Hall. Though there are reno-
vations going ‘on now, the library
will remain open, with various sec-
tions closing as those parts are
remodeled.

If quadratic equations.- and

advanced calculus are your bag, the V _

Mathematics Library in 430
Thackeray Hall can help you with
the trickiest of problems and
research. , f
But if you’re more interested in

Sigmund Freud or fight or ﬂight

reﬂexes, then the library in 217
Langley Hall should help you out.
With 70,000 books and 650 journal
subscriptions, there’s enough infor-
mation to keep any budding. psy-
chologist happy. 0

Looking for information on
library science, information science
or telecommunications‘? The
Information Sciences Library is the
place for you. Located at 135
Bellefield Ave., the library has
70,000 volumes and 470 journal
titles. And for some unspecified rea-
son, the Information Sciences
Library is also home to a collection
of children’s , literature.

The Frick, Fine Arts Library is
on the first ﬂoor of the Frick Fine

Arts Building, and while the collec— '

tions in this library don’t circulate,
students in history of art and archi-
tecture, fine arts and studio arts
classes can do research here.
Decorated with 1920s era ﬂair,.the
carved- wood and wrought-iron
stairs leading to the balcony make

'Frick’_s library unique on campus. ,
Libraries are generally a place’

for quiet, but there’s one place you
can go to listen. The Music Library
in Room B28 of the Music Building
houses more than 25,000 sound
recordings as well as a diverse col-
lection of early American hymnals

and sheet music.

0 Finally, there’s Pitt’s best-kept
library secret. The Darlington
Memorial library, on the sixth ﬂoor

of the Cathedral of Learning, is rich _

in information" pertaining to the
French and Indian War and the his-
tory of the Pittsburgh region. While
history is the main -focus of the

library, there is also a collection of

rare maps, atlases and Victorian lit-
erature. _

Too‘ much information here to
digest? No worries, all Freshman
Studies classes tour the library dur-
ing a class period, and any student

who is not enrolled in the class can -

get a walk-in tour simply by asking.

“Students should know that they
can always contact a librarian if
they have questions or to get them
started on‘ research,” said Amy
Knapp, the coordinator of library
instruction. -

But if students trying to do their
work are still striking out at finding
the right information, they’re not in
trouble just yet. The interlibrary
loan system allows students to bor-
row books from any of Pitt’s cam-
puses by filling out a form in person
or online. It can take a few days for
a book to arrive, though, which is
yet another good reason not to pro-
crastinate.

Towers lobby

Sparkly pants, barely-there sparkly
shirts, even sparkly eyes mix with ﬁeshly-
gelled hair and the scent cologne. It’s a
Friday night in Towers lobby.

At about 10:30 p.m., trafﬁc starts to pick
up '

meeting place before students head out for a
night of merrymaking.

A large group of pledges from Alpha
Kappa Psi, a co-ed business fraternity, con-
gregates near the chairs by the vending
machines, holding random items —— a
broom, a hanger, a giant cardboard sham-
rock —- the results of the scavenger hunt
they’ve been doing since 7 pm.

The group of eight or so pledges‘ bugs
their brothers for the next clue. Their fresh-
man brothers Amy Blecher and Mac Igi
look at each other before Igi decides with a
smile, “Why don’t you give us a cheer  one.
for Alpha Kappa?”

In need of the next item, the pledges

‘ bust some moves that could land them spots

on Pitt’s cheerleading squad. As their hunt
continues through the night, pledges can be
spotted leap-frogging and burmy-hopping
around the lobby. ’ '

Meanwhile, groups of people stand

’ talking or waiting for friends.

' Not everyone goes out on the week-
ends, of course. A group of students hangs
out by the benches near the laundry room,
playing a lively card game called Pittypat

Freshman Yorni Ogwirnogela looks up
brieﬂy from squabbling with one of his fel-
low card players to explain that they’re not
going out tonight because there is “nowhere
to go.” Ogwirnogela and his friends decided
to play cards instead.

Dwain Newell, also a freshman, joins
the group. He adds “There ain’t shit to do
here  it’s socially depressing.”

He explains. that the group often brings
a television to the lobby and watches a

- The weekends turn the lobby into a '

movie. They’re usually there until the clean- '

ing crew comes at about 4 am
At 1 am., the laundry room is empty:
Many students have retired to their pie-
shaped rooms and are being entertained by a
movie rental. ‘
The card players still man their spot,

and party-goers are starting to trickle in. «

Some people try to act more sober than they
otherwise seem as they scan their IDs and
enter the domrs. ‘

Save some burmy-hopping and leap-
frogging, it’s ‘been a typical night in the
Towers lobby. Main desk clerk Floyd’
Jackson says, “There’s not as much going on I
as you think, just a lot of moving around.
The kids are generally pretty good.”

Antoon’s, Atwood Street

Antoon’s pizza shop can be a scary
place to a ﬁrst-tirne customer.

As the smell of dough, spices and melt-
ed cheese hangs in ﬂre air, students pour in
and shout their order numbers over the ring-

ing of the phone, a sound. that doesn’t stop V

all night Most customers are upperclass-
men, somecome with ﬁiends and some are
in a hurry, but the very  amount of
space doesn’t stop them from trying
squeeze everybody inside. V ‘

But the employees never miss a beat.
When a number is announced for pick-up,
the pizza is already sitting and waiting, still
piping hot. Behind the counter, ﬂour—cov-
ered hands move too quickly over, the
dough, sauce and cheese to discern where
one pie ends and another begins. Their only
statement besides “Thank you” and “Have a
good night”~ is 7’Ihis isn’t a good time —-
we’re really busy right now.”

This action-packed atmosphere doesn’t
faze veteran customers. They come in with
$4.06 in hand and theirorder-number mem-
orized. Ten seconds after their arrival, they
are back on Atwood Street walking the pizza
home to friends. .

Senior Arush Panduia comes in at 9:30
pm, which he says is earlier than usual for
him .

' “I usually get here around 2 am. when
the bars close,” he says. “It’s good, cheap

pizza.” ‘

About 15 minutes later, three guys lean
against the pizzeria’s brick wall, patiently
waiting for their order to come up.
Graduates Wayne" Chang and Vinny Raj
accompany their senior friend Vasu
Gadiparthi to Antoon’s while reminiscing
about old times.

“I actually live in North Oakland,”
Gadiparthi says, “but-this place is so cheap,
and I’ve been going here forever.” Their pie
marks the beginning of a night of partying
and seeing old friends. 1

Most students who come to Antoon’s
think of it as a staple of their lives at Pitt.

isﬁed customer sums the place up in one

Sutherland  I

A cluster of shivering, giggling girls
huddle together to keep warm. Two_ wet-
headed guys slap hands while their Mardi
Gras beads sparkle in the street light. Getting
an early start, one hooded Pitt student‘guz-
zles‘ the last of his Natural Ice before tossing
the ‘canonto the Cathedral lawn.

Between cigarette drags and lotion
swapping, mild inquiries about Friday night
plans can beheard.."‘Yo man, where you

. going tonight? Delta Tau Delta or the dental

ﬁat?’ . .
VV1th the left turn onto Bigelow
Boulevard from Forbes Avenue, the head-

lights of the Sutherland Express become vis- ,

ible. The party-hungry crowd rushes the
shuttle, and the fun begins. "

Shuffling to the shuttle door, bodies col-
lide and the scents of hair spray and cologne
clash: ~ g _ *

. ‘ Pitt freshman Dana Minucci whips out
her compact to get one more glance. A

touch-up on the sparkly eye shadow here, a ’

' hair out of place there, and she’s set.

‘,‘We’re just gonna celebrate a long
week of school and hope we don’t pass out
because we gave blood today,” says

“Sony my jacket smells like smoke,”

says freshman Elizabeth Cooper to her-

neighbor on the shuttle. “I usually don’t
dress like this. My friends inﬂuenced me,
though. I hate frat parties. T‘hey’re meat fac-

tories, but I just want to dance,” she explains

After the threenstops on the hill, the

shuttle heads down to Forbes Avenue— and '
back to _the Wlliarn Pitt Union to make '

another delivery. The cycle continues ‘until
11:45 p.m. ’when the lull begins, and the

pack waiting for the bus  out. These ‘
groups are composed of party suagglers an 1

those in no hurry to get home. . t

p_ /’ Observing quietly ﬁom his backseat
vantage point, freshman "basketball player ‘
Chebon Troutman comments on thebus’ '

fashion runway center aisle. ‘They’re all

right. She’s nice, got the tight jeans, the wide _

hips and the big butt. But I’m going to sleep
now, sports get fatiguing.” V

 At 1:15 am, a group of South Oakland
informants catches the shuttle back to their

dorm. Freshman Nick Libeg says he wasat ..
‘ a party that “just got bus .”

“But it was one of those parties that
needed to get busted, ya’ know? Fat girls in
vinyl pants, and the keg line — I’m lucky I
can get by on my personality,” he says.

By now, the smell of stale french ﬂies 1

‘ and beer has replaced the 10:30.p.m. smell .
of hair spray and bubble gum. Pitt students. 1
stumble onto the bus and fall into a seat, '
some disappointed withthe night’s tumour, '

some simply exhausted. -

painted to match the purple ceiling circulate

the aroma of ﬂesh roasted coffee beans

throughout the warm, brightly lit building.
Unsuspecting groups of people gather.

.Four rniddle—aged adults, dressed in black

discuss the ﬁlmthey just saw. Two gray-
haired women huddle by the front window,
adopting “coffee posturez” shoulders
hunched, chest concave, mug of coffee
clasped between both hands. Three students
study, each alone, at tables along the farthest
wall of the room. . '

Above the din of conversations on
Polish ﬁlm and sounds of the two employ-
ees beginning to clean up for the evening,
the music of Duncan Sheik blares.

Two men share a table and drink coffee 3

over a chess board. A gray-whiskered man
sporting a tan Stetson hat, a leopard print
scarf, brown barn jacket and cowboy boots

‘ controls the white pieces. His companion, a

younger man with a smooth ponytail, sports
all black, except for red and white boots that
could be taken for clown shoes.

Anthony DeAngelis, one of the two
employees behind the counter, identiﬁes the
man in black as a‘“regular.”

“He always gets a ‘Shot in the Dark,”’
DeAngelis says. ’ ' '

A Pitt sophomore, DeAngelis works at
Kiva Han four days a week and has been
working since 3 p.m. He comments on the
concentration of older individuals and the
lack of Pitt students he sees tonight. i

.- “IthinkPitt students liketo drink——
more than ClVlU students,” he says.

When asked if. he thinks Pitt students

” just frequent Starbucks instead, he says, “I

hope not.”

DeAngelis isn’t bothered by the fact
that he’s ‘working on a Friday night; he
works almost every Fridaynight. .

“I don’t really go out that much,” he
says, and reveals he will most likely return
home to play video games. ~

, Cathedral of Learn” mg’ L

It’s no surprise that the Cathedral of
Learning is virtually empty on a Friday
night Most students, it would seem, have
had enough of the tower of tests and teach-
ers, and instead opt to spend the ﬁrst night of
their weekends elsewhere.

But for those seeking quiet or large

' open spaces in which to engage in activities
like practicing skits, the Cathedral is the _

place to be.

The commons room is eerily quiet.
About 10 students sit with noses in books,
and the hum of the overhead lights is ‘dis-
tractingly loud. 1

On ﬂue second ﬂoor, a man and a
woman huddle together on a bench. His face
is sorrowful, her eyes are puffy and red-
rimmed. They glare at passersby who inter-
rupt their private pain.

Other ﬂoors‘ are even quieter. The new

tTHEPnTNEws-NEWSIUDENTGUIDE

white paint job on the 10th ﬂoor is so bright
that staring directly at the walls could dam-
age one’s retinas. The smell of carpentry is
almost overwhelming on the 24th ﬂoor. The
Honors College is closed  evening, and
in the elevator bay of the 36th ﬂoor, a group
from the business fraternity declines to com-
ment on the Britney Spears skit they
rehearse. . ,_

But the real action in the Cathedral is on
the ground ﬂoor. Here, a group of black—clad
students meet every week from 7:30 p.m to
midnight for Live Action Role Play. The
group has between 20 and 50 members who
participate in the improvised skits titled
“Vampire: The Masquerade.”

Some go all out and wear realistic fangs
and blood that dripsdown their faces, while
others don a simple black uniform. A

“We just pretend to be vampires and act
out their interactions,” says Adam Fleming,
a player in the group.

Members come and go, but many stay
for quite a while and have been involved in

other role play activities. Fleming has been 3

involved for a little over a year.

“Yeah, .we’re a little weird,” he says,

"but it’s a lot of fun.”

‘University Beverage Center

There is one thing that is certain about
Oakland — its citizens buy a lot of beer, and
after 10 p.m. there is only one place to do

By 10:15 the line at the University
Beverage Center stretches from the counter
to the back of the store, and uncountable gal-
lons of alcohol are on their way out into the
world.

Two cases of Natty Ice for a frat boy in
Old Navy cargo pants and a ratty baseball
cap. .

One ball tap, no keg, for a short chubby

' man with a 5-inch—tl1ick Afro.

One case of Budweiser bottles for a

.-woman dressed entirely in gray and red:

gray sweats, red T-shirt and cap, and two-
tone sneakers to bring it all together.

The last two cases of Straub belong to a
man-in an old Tar Heels cap and brown cor-

" duroys.

Sixty‘ cans of Budweiser to a young
man who bears a striking resemblance to
Brett Favre. _

One case of Heineken to a woman who
is loud, obnoxious and seems to already be
drunk. “It’s like -— it’s like —-— it’s like the
islan ,” she says, stumbling to the counter.

One keg of Bud light and a tap for men

dressed in Abercrombie and Adidas, plan— ‘

ning their party while waiting in line.

Wall of Shame: where fake IDs go to die.
The wall is covered with them, mostly from

that any hologram is better than none.

A South Oakland party

Crarnmed sardines into a sweaty,

I unfurnished basement only to wait for a sin-

gle cup of cheap beer for half an hour — it
can only be a South Oakland party, a cor-
nerstone of Pitt’s Friday nightscene.

The fun starts with tossing $5 —— $3 if
you’re a woman — at a fellow Pitt strident
He’ll toss back a two-cent plastic cup, but
don’t let the cheap payback fool you, it’s the
ticket to party.

Semple Street Friday night

Chilly, but not unbearable, the night

sees small groups of students ﬁom as far as ‘
' —— Benjamin Rubin, stqﬁ’wn'ter

Duquesne University clamor into the house,
with its grimy walls and dirty, beer-soaked
ﬂoor.

People enter the house in sporadic
surges. Attendance reaches its peak of near-
ly 300 by the time the police arrive at 12:20

Still, before police arrived, people
crowd into two ﬂoors of the house that holds
almost no furniture at all. The kitchen is
abhorrent. The bathroom’s ﬁlth is unrivaled.

The dungeon-like basement boasts only
one light bulb in the center of the room.
Smiling drinkers bask in its light. Students

play beer pong with overwhelming serious- ~

ness in a connecting room. Every so often,
cheers erupt ﬁom the room as a skillful team
member sinks the dirt—encrusted pingpong
ball into a foamy cup of brew. .

As he works the door, Allan Sumner,
one of the house’s residents, explains the
intricacies and high proﬁt margins of throw-
ing a patty-

“On a real good night, we can make
about $800 total proﬁt,” Surrmer says.

Sumner said that since this house is a
party house, there is almost no fumiture in
order to accommodate both the volume of
people and the ﬁlth they create during the
parties. He and his housemates live upstairs
and don’t use the party ﬂoors during the
week »

In the incredible body heat and stench
of cigarettes and beer stands Mike Hritz,
proudly working the keg with speed and
determination while being swamped by a

. pack of drunks.

“It’s a good night, ‘dude, what can I
say?” Hritz exclairns.
“This is the longest time I’ve had to

wait for my ﬁrst beer,” says a bitter Joe

Jankowski.

Soon, there is little room to move.

But shortly after midnight, the police
arrive, more than happy to ﬁx that problem.

As a huge crowd of frowning faces
spills out of the house on Semple, the night

ends early and students must wait until the
next night to party all over again.

Neighborhood bar tour

There are two pool games going on in
the brick-lined back roorrr of Bootlegger’s
on Sernple Street, one game for each table.
College students sit around the perimeter
singing along to the last choruses of “Dream
On.” At the tables, Jon Stalrna sinks a two
ball. ’

"Ihere’s deﬁnitely a lot of  com-p

petition here,” he says and points to a mid-

. dle-aged man in a loose blue dress shirt who -

stands conﬁdenﬂy at the other table.

“He’s good,” Stalrna says, “but there’s
about every "skill range represented here.
 a good place to come if you’re 21 and
want to shoot pool.” »

Out in the main room, men and women ‘

talk in groups around the long bar in the cen-
ter of the room. The room smells faintly of
cigarette smoke, perfume and, of course,
alcohol.

' Three televisions ‘deliver March
Madness, and by one of these stands Sean
Boynes, 22. Tonight he’s in the middle of a
bar-hopping tour of South Oakland with his
ﬁiends. '

“South Oakland is the place to be,”

_ Boynes says. “It’s close tohome, so ‘you

don’t have to worry about driving drunk”
Across the room, Erin Glowczewski

and Heather Boylan sit together surveying

the room, waiting‘ for some ﬁiends.
Glowczewski, who plans to spend between
$12 and $15 tonight, says that she usually

goes to Denny’s Bar. She’s used to a more’

familiar crowd.
It’s about midnight now, prime time for

bar hopping. A few streets away at Denny’s,

people ﬁlter in. Inside, the bar is bigger than
it seems ﬁom the street, but it’s deﬁnitely a
small, cozy-looking place.

Johrmy Cash plays on the jukebox. On -

the stained wood walls hang several Pitt-
and alcohol-related items. There is a picture

Freshman Chi Omega sister Dana  touches up her makeup aboard the

 

of the crowd storming the ﬁeld at the ﬁnal
game at Pitt Stadium. Apiece of the stadium
hangs from it on a string.

The 38-year-old bartender, Gene Ney,
greets everyone with a large smile. He
makes friendly, easy conversation with his

' customers as he pours baer from a 1ong-han- c

dled tap. He seems to know everyone by
name. -

“We’re a small bar, we’re a friendly
bar,” he says proudly. “I always say we’re a
neighborhood bar for college students.”

Ney claims that his liquor license is the
oldest in Oakland. He brings several antique
licenses from the ‘40s and ‘50s out from the
basement as proof. They are age-browned
cards marked with fountain pens.

Near 2 am., the crowd has thinned. One
of the last customers, referred to as “Billy,” a
man in his late 20s, _rests his head on the bar,
a little too drunk. He fumbles fora cigarette
inside his blue jean jacket, "ﬁnds nothing-in
his pack, puts it back, then tries again-. '

Outside, along the street, people are’

attacking pizzas from Antoon’s as they walk
home. Others are talking in too-loud voices
about going to “after hours” at Laga. The
bars may have closed, but there’s still a lot of
drinking to do.

Groove is an all-ages, after-hours event

' from 11 p.m.-5 am. that showcases popular

rave DJs. The DJs spin all forms of elec-
tronic music: house, techno, drum and bass,
trance and breaks. DJ Knowledge is on the

tumtables, making most people dance, while _

some people cringe at his small mistakes.

Of course, a club night dedicated to rave
music will have a lot of ravers, but‘ frat boys

‘brings 500 people, and the dance ﬂoor can
become crowded.

“In the beginning and end of the night

there’s lots of room to dance,” said Perry.

At the bar, there isless motion than on
the dance ﬂoor. Those under 21 have to stay
on the dance ﬂoor, but patrons 21 and over
can ﬁnd a small - bit of sanctuary in the
caged-in bar from the calamity on the dance

Schenley Park

. Don’t worry about the sign at the
entrance to that park that says, “Park closed
11:00 pm to 5:00 am.” Just ignore it.
Because it’s a quarteriafter 11 on Friday and
no cops are going to come in" and give any-
one any trouble. 0

While, walking down the broken con- 0

crete stairs to the cement pond at the bottom
of me hollow, a transcendental bliss settles
over all visitors. Though Schenley Park is in
the city, it feels like it is miles away from civ-
ilization, and the soul joins with nature. ‘

But. the hum of the beehive city is
inescapable. R’ed lights glow above the trees,
and only one star is visible-in the sky. Sitting
on a wall by the pond, Posvar Hall leers over
the hillside to the west, like a giant concrete
disease eating the last rerrrrrants of nature.

. A pair of brown ducks ﬂoat across the
pond, breaking the layer of thin scum as they
swim. They are ﬂre only sign of life.

It is dark except for a few dim street
lights. Paranoia begins to set in.

There. There was a noise in the woods.
What was it? A deer? Rabbits? Boﬂr are
doubtful; little wildlife seems to live here.
More likely the sounds are that of a home-
less man erecting his shelter for the night out
of some sticks, bark and perhaps a piece of
twine discovered on the sidewalk back in
Oakland. , '

At this time of night, all the exercise
enthusiasts are long gone. The park is now
only ﬂre home of nature-ﬁiendly lovers and
dope ﬁends. _ -

Out of the hollow and a half mile down

«Schenley Oval, a trio of youths stand behind

the majestic fountain, passing a glowing red
ember around between them. When
approached by visitors, they turn and ﬂee
into the -woods. ‘ '

' The park is quiet again, but not asleep.
Though its life is hidden, obscured by dark
shadows and tucked behind trees and bush-
es, the park never sleeps.

ELIZABETH BOWEN ‘

Managing Editor I

When sophomore David Vanyo

arrived at Pitt as a freshman, finding“

a barber or stylist capable of cutting
his blond, luscious locks certainly
wasn’t his first worry.

In about a month, though, it was
due time for a trim. .

Vanyo takes his hair fairly seri-

' ously. “It’s pretty important because.

it’s right there on top of my head —
it’s the first thing people see,” he
said.

An Allentown, Pa., native,
Vanyo was not initially hip to the

advice of an upperclassman friend
and went to Supercuts, where he has
been rather satisfied withthe ser-
vices.

Supercuts may be a good option

for other students looking for con-
venience and affordability. Located
at 3611 Forbes’Av_e., Supercuts is
open 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p-.m.
Saturday and» 10 a.m. ‘to 5 p.m.
Sunday.
_ Students can only schedule an
appointment within one hour of
their phone call. Prices range from
$11 for a basic haircut to $22 for a
shampoo, cut and blow-dry.

“We’re kind of ala carte —-— you
pay for what you want separately,”
explained Kari Harris, a_stylist at
Supercuts. ‘

In terms of convenience, Pizazz
Hair Fashions, at 33708 Fifth Ave.
(next to Student Health Services), is

‘another viable , option for students
' living on campus.

Pizazz’s doors are open‘ from 12
to 7 p.m. Monday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Tuesday through Friday and 8 a.m.
to 2 p.m. every other Saturday.

' “Forbes Field is one of the great
bal1parks,” said Bob Friend, a right-
handed pitcher who started for the
Pirates from 1951 to 1966. “ Th e
players liked playing there because
it was such a unique field,” Friend
said. _ A

The infield was grass, “firm and

hard” as Friend remembered, but,

‘_‘everyone complained about the
crooked third base line.”

The route between home and
third was notorious for its uneven
bumps and even more uneven
bounces it caused batted balls to
take.

knocked out New York Yankees

shortstop Tony Kubek during the

famous last game in the 1960

“The ball jumped off the ground
and hit him in the throat,” Friend"
said. “That was Forbes Field. That
was part of the charm.”

The outfield was even distinc-

ter would be awarded a ground-rule

“sight.” 7
Friend said that Forbes Fiel

was thought of as a hitter’s park. “It 4

had ivy spreading up the [outfield]
wall and players could pick the ball
up well [against the dark green—con-
trast].” .

Forbes seated anywhere from

35,000 to 40,000 fans, many of‘

whom were from the "local colleges
and surrounding area.

“There were 50-cent seats in
left field,” Friend said. “Most of the
people out there had no shirts, and
were drinking beer and raising hell.

. It was great.”

The Oakland community played
an important role in the success, of
the ballpark and gave it its sense of
home. Many players would go to
Frankie Gustine’s, bar on Forbes
Avenue‘ after games. Gustine played
third base for the Pirates from
1939-48. ,

Likewise, many players from
opposing teams could be seen in" or
around the Schenley. Hotel, now the

William Pitt Union, where they ,.

would stay becauseof the build-
ing’s prestige "and convenient
access to the park.

But while Friend and his team-
mates were emotionally attached to
Forbes Field, they recognized that it
had its problems. Among them were

a series of poles and posts that ’

blocked the View of many fans.

. “I think most of us felt pretty
bad about it, ‘hoping they might be
able to modernize it,” Friend said.
“But they left Oaklandand Forbes

‘Field for‘Three Rivers Stadium,’

which hasn’t been a good baseball
field.” ‘ - . e _

And that is why the Pirates are
leaving it for PNC Park, a throw-

back ballfield that was constructed .

on the North Side.
“You know, it’s amazing that
_after all these 30 years, the fran-

chises are going back to the older-‘

styled stadiums,” Friendsaid. “The

‘new one_,is’ going to be aebeauty,“

with the grass, the intimate seating
and the fans close to the players.

’ And that’s' the way the ‘game was

supposed to be played.” ~

Starting in 1895, a small arena
on Fifth Avenue and North Craig
Street named the Duquesne Gardens

V housed several Pittsburgh hockey '

teams and hosted some of the most
prominent boxing matches of the
day until it was destroyed in the
1950s. . A
Tom “Scoop” Saulsbury remem-
what he did when . the
Duquesne Gardens ‘was’ ‘knocked
down in 1956." _- .
“I cried,” said Saulsbury, who
first worked at the Gardens in 1952
as a stick boy and assistant trainer
for the Hornets, Pittsburgh’s

American Hockey.League team.

“Hell yeah, I did. I got a brick
around here somewhere,” he said.

The Gardens,‘ which housed
most of Pittsburgh’s hockey games
until the Civic Arena came into
existence, had an unusual start.

“It was an old streetcar barn,”
said Saulsbury, who worked with
the Hornets until they disbanded in
11967. He then worked with the
Penguins at the Civic Arena until
his.l985 retirement. '

The Gardens, which sat on the
property on Fifth Avenue where the
Park Plaza Condominiums and ,
Duranti’s Restaurant sit today,‘ was
constructed around '_1890 for the
Duquesne Traction Company.

Then, five years later, the two-
story brick building was converted
into a skating rink and auditorium.

The single tier of, bleachers
could seat about 5,000 people, who,
Saulsbury said, were “really stuffed ‘

“The bestseat was behind the
goal. .When I was in the eighth
grade, when I started going to
games, I’d get the 60-cent tickets to
sitbehind the goal.”

But the Duquesne Gardens was
not only a home to hockey. “There
was always something going on
there,” Saulsbury said. '

The Ice Capades, the roller
derby, the circus and the
Metropolitan Opera all held their

events at the Duquesne Gardens.
Before the Civic Arena’s construc-
tion, Duquesne University’s basket-
ball team played its home games"
there. Before Sau1sbury’s time, in
1938, there was even aqmarathon
dance competition,‘ in which Art

Ferrar of Shaler won. by moving .

around for 523 hours.

And, of course, there were also
many boxing fights, headlined by
bouts including,Fritzie Zivic and
Billy Conn.

But while the sporting events
and fans» made the Duquesne
Gardens such an endearinglplace to
people like Saulsbury, the Oakland
community was also part of its
charm. I

“A lot of the guys would go to
Mass at St. Paul’s Cathedral before

' games, like I did,” Saulsbury said.

He also mentioned that after
games, Mitchell’s, Luna and
Frankie Gustine’s bar on Forbes
Avenue were all popular venues to
visit. _

“Oakland was a~~different' place
back then. The businesses there

'were all family businesses. There
'were

no chains then
McDonald’s,”- Saulsbury said.

The Gardens were gone by the
time O’Brien came to college, but
Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field suf-
ficed for his sports experience.

“I grew up four miles from Pitt
in Hazelwood, but it was as if
Oakland was another world,” he

said. .“I" thought it was the greatest \

‘ while, but I felt comfortable getting
it done there,” she said.

A few minutes’ walk from the
Cathedral, two salons are located in
the area of South Craig Street.
Veraldi Salon is located at 4606
Winthrop St., about half a block
from South Craig. Hours of opera-
tion are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday
through Saturday, and appointments
are preferred. Including a student

“discount, haircuts start at $17 for.

' men and $20 for women.
“We cut a lot of students’ hair —
both Pitt and CMU,” said stylist
Marla Degenhardt, who emphasized

to basic cuts.

Mark Anthony Hair Salon, at
311 S. Craig St., is open from 7 a.m.
to‘ 6:30 p.m. Tuesday through
Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday and
Saturday and Sundays by appoint-

’ ment only. Prices for haircuts range

from $18 to $30, with student dis-
counts varying with the cut, and styl-
ist. Mark Anthony also offers color
and hair relaxing treatments.

A quick jaur\1t"on- the 61C bus
can transport one to Philip Pelusi, at
1814 Murray Ave. in.Squirrel Hill.
This establishment is open from 8
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.‘ Saturday
and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.

 

and women’s haircuts are between
$21.95 and $40, depending on the
experience of the'stylist, and a stu-
dent discount varies accordingly.

Of course, for the utmost in con-
venience and affordability, finding a
hair-savvy friend to trim one’s
tresses is always an alternative.
After. a few . appointments at
Supercuts, Vanyoultimately found
his hairdresser of choice in his pal

“The first time he did it I was

But Mc.Cormick clearly had one bi
advantage over Supercuts. '

“He did it for free,” Vanyo

explained with enthusiasm.

ished by the beginning of the year, the
facility will help to eliminate excess clut-
ter in Hillrnan Library.

“We have owned a warehouse  that
we are doing a lot of work on for storage
facilities,” Pack said “The goal  is to
relieve the density of Hjllman signiﬁcant-
ly so that we have more room for readers

and support space for students and facili- .

“You’ll see the environment in
Hillman become much nicer than it has
been just in terms of how overcrowded it
is,” he said.

While the_erecting of new facilities is
exciting in its own right, the campus
improvement process also works in much

humbler areas, like the classrooms and _

overall aesthetics of the University.

“We started about six years ago a
classroom improvement project, on
which we spend about a million_and ahalf
dollars every year on classrooms,” Pack
said. Under this program, thejclassrooms
that need the most work are renovated,

' and some of of the money goes to upgrad-

’ .

ing classroom technology.

The ﬁrst step taken each year is
improvements‘ to the large lecture halls in
which introductory classes are typically
taught. ..
“In the large lecture halls we will put
in  computer ports, network ports, so the

faculty can bring in a laptop ‘and work _

directly ﬁom that. There will be a projec-
tion system built into [the lecture hall] —-
tl1ere will be full AV support,” Pack said.

Once the larger classrooms have
been taken care of, the smaller classrooms
are updated in a progression based on
size. -

Pack said the theory behind furnish-
ing small rooms is “to try and match the
technology with the classroom.”

“You constantly need to keep invest-
ing in your classrooms,” he added.

Pitt is unique because it is an urban
campus. Located between’ the residential
district of Squirrel Hill and the businesses
of Downtown, Oakland is home to the
University. And while it is pleasant to
have so many parks and stores nearby, it
is also very easy for an urban campus to
get swallowed up by the surrounding
areas. ’

_ “What the University has tried to do
is present a greater sense of campus,”
Pack said. “When you’re an urban school,
obviously it’s hard not to just have every-
thing just sort of blend together.”

The University’s solution has been to

mark the geography of the campus “so A

that the students and everybody else
knows when they are on the University of
Pittsburgh campus.”

Toward this goal, the University has

hung banners aroundcampus. __

~ “We are such a signiﬁcant part of
[Pittsburgh] that we really wanted to mark
it out so that students really know when
they are on campus,” Pack said. “And it
looks attractive.” '

A free ride: the  

PAT bus

MAC BOOKER

Staff Writer

It happens all the time. You need to go
somewhere, say to the Monroeville Mall to
inﬂate your credit card bill or to _a job inter-
view so the debt can be relieved. The bus
goes there, sure, but you haven’t gota nick-

‘ el to your name.

Have no fear. If you are on top of
things, you will have already visited the ID

center and picked up your new Pitt ID.‘

Terriblepicture, perhaps, but you now have
your ticket to ride to the farthest reaches of
Allegheny County, not only on buses, but
also on the Port Autl1ority’s Light Rail
Transit.System, the T, and the Duquesne
and Monongahela inclines. I ‘

Pitt has an agreement with the Port
Authority of Allegheny County, in which
the University paid $3.8 million for the last
two years, and in return anyone with a Pitt
ID can ride all over the county on PAT trans-
portation for free. ~

According to PAT spokesman Bob .

Grove, 98 percent of buses — and 100 per-
cent of buses that run on weekends —— are
handicap-accessible. ‘

The T is Pittsburgh’s light rail system,
which would be called a subway if most _of
it was underground or an el if it ran on raised
tracks. It runs from Downtown to South
Hills Village mall. I I

The inclines" are unique to Western
Pennsylvania. An incline consists of two
cars on tracks, counterbalanced with a
cable. The two inclines in_Pittsburgh take
you to the top of Mount Washington. The
Monongahela Incline goes ﬁom the shops
and restaurants at Station Square’ to the
incredible views. on Grandview Avenue.
The Duquesne Incline departs ﬁom an
abandoned building surrounded by a huge
gravel lot and arrives ‘at a less impressive
stretch of Grandview. ' ,

To get to the Monongahela Incline, take
any of the 61 or 71 buses that run westward
(going away ﬁom the Cathedral) on Fifth
Avenue. Then walk across the Srnithﬁeld
Street Bridge — interestingly, built by the

same guy who died building the Brooklyn ,
Bridge. ‘

After crossing, look. for the tracks on
the side of the hill. This is the incline. Hop

, on, forfree. Waming——thecarstarts witha
‘ jerk Enjoy the View on the way up and at
L the top. A -

To continue your exploration of

Pittsburgh, walk across the street and hop on g

the T to head back Downtown. Make sure

system

you go the right way, toward Downtown, or
you’ll end up in Mount Lebanon.

There are plenty of other reasons to
take the bus. The 28X Airport Flyer comes
to the rescue when you need to catch a ﬂight
home for vacation. If you would like to see
a movie, the 61C to Squirrel Hill and
Homestead will put you close to no less than
three theaters. Or, if independent and for-
eign ﬁlms are more to your liking, you can
ﬁnd them Downtown at the Harris Theater,
taking any bus in the 61 or 71 series. '

PAH‘ provided special bus service from
Oakland to the North Side for Pitt football
games last season.

“We anticipate doing that again,”
Grove said. _ 0

If you wish to do other things that
require leaving Oakland, you can ﬁnd bus

schedules and maps on the mezzanine level .

of the Wrlliarn Pitt Union or in the parking

and transportation ofﬁce, located in

Brackenridge Hall. ‘ ' h .
Alternatively, you can call PAT’s cus-

tomer service number, 442-2000. This is

useful if you want to get from point A to
point B but do not know‘ which buses con-
nect the two places. In addition, you can

ﬁnd bus schedules online at www.ride- V

gold.com.

Pitt and the Port Authority plan to rene-

gotiate theircontractthis summer.’ Two of
the ﬁve years provided for in the armually
renewable agreement have passed. Port

Authority would like more money this year, ’

citing rising fuel costs and decreased state

funding, and would like to start negotiations - ‘
- immediately. '

Pitt would like not to pay more money,

and Pitt spokesman Ken Service said that

the University hopes that the ridership ﬁg-
ures for the ﬁrst quarter of this year will be
lower than they have been in the past.
Representatives of the University and Port

Authority believe the negotiations will be '

ﬁnished by the July 31 deadline.

Wherever a Pitt student is going, he
should think each time he sees one of the
Port Authority’s 1,000 buses, 55 light rail
trains or four incline cars, “I could be riding
that.” .

A ﬁnal warning ——-‘buses going east on
Fifth Avenue have their own lane. When
crossing, be sure to look both ways. It is
easy-‘to forget that Fifth Avenue is not entire-
ly one way. Even if one does not step into
the street, bus mirrors extend over the curb
and could hit someone who is standing too
close to the edge. ’ 0’

Schenley Park allows one to take in a gorgeous glimpse of the the city’s skyline.

Pittsburgh geography

provides stellar views

DAVIDVMCKENZIE

— Contributing Editor

One ' of the great things about
Pittsburgh is its topography. The city is
uniquely located at the conﬂuence of three
major rivers in the Allegheny Mountains.
These mountains are not very high -
many from the West would be apt to call
them hills —- but they are high enough to
provide breathtaking views.

_ Take, for instance,
Washington. At the top of it, on a street
aptly named Grandview Avenue, you can
stand on concrete overlooks and gaze
across the Monongahela River at down-
town Pittsburgh, eye level with the tops of
the skyscrapers. , a

You can go for a walk, admire the
million—dollar homes and take a date —— or
get your parents to take you — to one of
the many dining establishments, all of

'- which provide an excellent View of the

c1ty." .
You can easily get to Mount

. Washington by taking any of the buses

that run through Oakland to Downtown,
getting off at Smithﬁe1d'Street, crossing
the Smithﬁeld Street Bridge and taking
the Monongahela or Duquesne incline.

A few hundred feet below Grandview
Avenue lie the Fort Pitt Tunnels, which
allow I-279 to avoid climbing Mount
Washington. On one side of the tubes, you
feel as if you’re in a suburban or even rural

A area. But as you go through the tunnels,

your radio signal peters out for a few sec-
onds, and then, seemingly instantly, you
are immersed in the sparkle of Downtown.

Mount’ V

You can also get a spectacular View of
the city a mile or so away from the Fort
Pitt Tunnels on the Boulevard of the
Allies. The Airport Flyer takes this route.

Located high above the Monongahela

River, you can see the river below and the
South Side, withits magniﬁcent churches
and houses. South Side itself, especially at
the tops of the slopes, offers some breath-
taking Views of the city.

Close to campus, Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park provides a good view.
Located across Panther Hollow from the

Carnegie museums and the Frick Fine

Arts buildirig, you can study there or play
a game of frisbee or football. Duringthe
winter, Flagstaff Hill is an excellent spot

for sledding. From here, you can see all of A

Oakland and even the tops of buildings
Downtown.

Pittsbu1gh’s great views don’t just

come from streets and hills — the city’s

' tall buildings can also offer ideal vantage

points. From the top of ‘the USX Tower -
the tallest building between New York and
Chicago — you can see for miles on‘ a
clear day. .

For another breathtaking and conve-
nient view, simply venture to the top of the
Cathedral of Learning. The top ﬂoors —
especially the large windows in the
Honors College on the 35th ﬂoor — offer
phenomenal views of Pittsburgh and the
surrounding area D V

Pittsburgh has a multitude of places
for you to peer out over the cityf Because
the views are so wonderful, you really feel

a as if the city is at your doorstep. When you

can see everything, it doesn’t seem so
huge. ' '

_THEPrrrNEws-NEW STUDENT GUIDE

SUMMER, 2001

‘To know the ‘burgh is o explre s nighborhoods

LESLIE HOFFMAN
Contributing Editor

My friends from ﬂat, neatly planned
cities such as Chicago, Atlanta and
Columbus, Ohio, frequently curse
Pittsburgh’s eccentric driving conditions.
But its narrow, hilly roads do not phase
me, its mere four—lane highways only
amuse me and its relative lack of a city
plan merely interests me.

In fact, Pittsburgh’s city plan is actu-
ally quite friendly. Just like “Mr. Roger’s
Neighborhood,” ﬁlmed here in the city,
we Pittsburghers like our neighborhoods,
and this is how we have arranged our
Clty.

Fortunately, as Pitt students living in
the heart of Oakland, we are absolved of
the frustrations of driving in this city by
the exhaustive number of buses that pass
through Oakland on their way to the
other neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. At
least, one bus route passes through
Oakland on its way to one of the six
other main parts of the city. Sometimes
more than one bus goes to the same part
of the city.

So where can you go from Oakland
and how do you get there? '

Downtown
While Downtown often takes some
ﬂack from Pittsburghers for not being as

exciting as other parts of the city, it is
deﬁnitely the center of the city, and
understanding Downtown can lead to
proper orientation and understanding of
other parts of the city. »
Downtown is most active during th

day, and becomes relatively dull at night.
But Downtown is most active at night

ELIZABETH BOWEN/MANAGING EDITOR

The Byham  is one of the ﬁxtures of Downtowifs Cultural District.

when the theaters have a show, and the
most action after hours can likely be
found in the Cultural District, whereethe
Benedum Center for the Performing
Arts, Heinz Hall, the Byharn Theater and
the Pittsburgh Public Theatre reside.
Several of the city’s nicest restaurants
can be found Downtown, as well as all of

the city’s department stores.

The famous three rivers converge at
the Point, represented by the fountain in
Point State Park. From the Point, to the
left across the Monongahela River, the
South Side is visible. To the right, across
the Allegheny River, the North Side can
be seen.

While many buses head Downtown
from many parts of the city, those that
travel through Oakland most often and
go Downtown include the 61 series, the
71 series, the 100 and the 500. Catch
these buses on Fifth Avenue opposite the
Towers.

The North Side V

The North Side is rather simple to
reach from Downtown, and at times it
may be easier and faster to reach by tak-
ing a bus Downtown and then walking
across one of the three yellow bridges,
rather than taking a bus directly to the
North Side.

Here, the Pittsburgh Pirates play at
PNC Park, and the Steelers ‘and the Pitt
Panthers ‘will play at the new football
stadium this fall. ‘

Despite its general devotion to ath-
letics, opportunities for cultural and
intellectual immersion also exist on the
North Side, which is home to three
museums, an aviary and the Carnegie

Science Center. _

. The Andy Warhol Museum, the
avant-garde Mattress Factory and the
Children’s Museum all occupy space
close to the North Shore. The aviary can
be found close to the Children’s Museum
and the Mattress Factory.

The science center, however, is adja-
cent to the football stadium, and actually
perches on the shore of the Ohio River. It
hosts an Omnimax theater, a planetari-
um, a retired military’ submarine and
"constantly rotating exhibits.

The 54C and the 500 buses travel to
the North Side. Take the 54C which
leaves from the William Pitt Union sid
of Fifth Avenue. ‘

The South Side I

Technically, the South Side can also
be reached by walking from Downtown,
but there are two very different parts of
the South Side: Station Square, which
can be reached by foot, and Carson
Street, which cannot.

Station Square, which hosts many
restaurants and several boutique-type
stores, actually caters more to adults than
college students. The Gateway Clipper
Fleet, Pittsburgh’s big white river-boats,
launches from Station Square, and mod-
erately well-known bands perform at the
IC Light Amphitheatre.

In addition, the Monongahela and
Duquesne lnclines are located here. The
inclines provide access to Mt.

Washington and a scenic, photogenic
view of the city.

Carson Street has a different, more
bohemian atmosphere than Station
Square. While heavily populated on any
given day with both shoppers and work-
ers, the South Side’s “main street” also
boasts a busy night life. Bars, cafes, chic
restaurants and diners provide abundant
opportunities to drink, satisfy your sweet
tooth, sip an expensive espresso or just
eat a sandwich.

The shopping on the South Side is
very unique as well. Here, bibliophiles
can peruse‘ selections in several different
used book stores. Music lovers can comb
used record stores and a guitar shop.
Sty1e—conscious students can choose
from choice vintage threads, slacker
wear or slick duds at the numerous small
clothing boutiques along Carson Street.
Or you can get pierced or tattooed at any
number of specialty shops along the
street.

In addition, various antique stores

can be found here, and so can several art ’

galleries. The best part of Carson Street
is that all of these places can be found on
this specific street itself.

The South Side can be reached in
about 10 minutes by taking a 54C bus
leaving from the Athletic Association on
Fifth Avenue. Station Square can be
reached by taking the subway from
either the Gateway Center, the USX sta-
tion or the Wood Street station.

Walnut Street in ‘Shadyside boasts a variety of shopping venues.

I The Strip District

Ah, the Strip District  from the
fresh wholesale produce and meat mar-
kets to the bars and clubs, and all its

_ exciting sights, sounds, scents and tastes,
the Strip is perhaps the most exotic of, all

of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods. .
Located on the Allegheny River, the
Strip can be found by walking, driving or
taking a bus through Downtown, or by
driving or taking a bus ‘behind North

: Oaklandand other small neighborhoods.

The Strip is also more industrial than
the other major neighborhoods of the
city; it is organized to promote business
transactions. ‘Warehouses are a common
sight, and many of the shops are located
in buildings which used to have more
practical functions, like the furniture
manufacturer whose showroom used to
be a ﬁre station at the turn of the century.

The Strip District can be reached by
the 500 and the-54C. Catch the 54C on
the same side of Fifth Avenue as the
Union. '

Squirrel Hill - —
Relatively close to Oakland, this res-
idential area also boasts many specialty
shops including placesjto ﬁnd books,
music, shoes, ice cream and groceries.
The Squirrel Hill Giant Eagle sup-
plements the cupboards of many a Pitt
student who cannot abide by the dining
plan, as well as those students who have
moved ‘off-campus. In addition to
Oakland and Shadyside, many students

and members of the University call this . if

area their home. _
Catch the 61A and the 61C on
Forbes Avenue to go to Squirrel Hill.

Shadyside

Similar to Squirrel Hill, Shadyside is
also a residential area with several streets
full of prime shopping and eating estab-
lishments. Walnut Street offers the con-
veniences of the Gap, Banana Republic
and Ann Taylor as well as more high—end

fashion such as boutiques touting the lat-
est styles‘ from Fendi, Prada, Dolce and
Gabbana and other European designers.
Ellsworth Avenue, slightly quirkier
than Walnut Street, is home to two spiffy
vintage stores, antique shops, a Japanese
grocery, cute delis and cafes and A an
unconventionally stylish laundromat.
Ellsworth Avenue, though very unique,
is also rather quiet and peaceful.
‘ The 71C and the 71A both transport
passengers to Shadyside. I

Oakland

As weinear the end of our whirlwind
tour of the city, we return to our home,
Oakland. So big that it’s often divided

' into two parts, North and South Oakland,

all Pitt students grow to become vastly

familiar with this part of the city._.Pift-

itself is spread out through what one
could call central Oakland, ' loosely
bound by Forbes and Fifth avenues.

The shops and restaurants bordering
these two avenues house the hangouts of

many a Pitt student. Here, Pitt students ,
‘can clothe themselves with the garments

from such shops as Avalon, The $9.99
Stock‘ Room and Young Navy (technical-

ly in South Oakland, on South Bouquet
Street). Typical college hippie stores like
Tela Ropa feature‘ all the Phish apparel
and incense money can buy.‘

Students looking to escape from the
dining halls can also survey the menus of
tons of restaurants that make their homes
in Oakland simply because of {the
University. Aside from American dining
available at popular student hangouts
like Fuel and Fuddle and Hemingway’s,

Oakland features an abundance of ethnic .

and international ‘restaurants, such as the
Spice Island Tea House and Ginza.
Many restaurants such as Fuel and
Fuddle, Hemingway’s, Mad. Mex. and
India Garden offer ha1f—price menus after
10 or 11 p.m. _

South Oakland also plays host to fre-
quent house parties, which many, stu-
dents consider to be a staple of the Pitt
experience. _ . .

Also, after ayear or two of residence

' hall living, scores of students migrate to

South Oakland’s- off-campus houses and

apartments. _
North_Oakland, which is essentially

considered” to be the area close to the

‘Carnegie Museum and the area opposite

Fifth Avenue, tends to have nicer hous-

-ing and trendier shopping‘ and restau-
rants. Craig Street, which intersects, ‘

Forbes and Fifth past the museum, is
another cute street with good restaurants,-
used book and music stores, an art store,

video rental places and several specialty f
gift shops. A '

Many students also choose to live in
North Oakland, and several- apartment
buildings and houses provide students
with residential options. Our collegiate
neighbor Carnegie "Mellon can be found

several blocks up Forbes Avenue as well. -

And so ends our rapid tour of the
city. As I’m sure you’re’well aware, this
has .~ been merely an overview, and as
time will show, you will learn much
more about the city’s other neighbor-
hoods that I do not have time to ramble
on about. Buy a map, take the buses,
don’t be afraid to ask for directions or go
to new places. Have f11n learning about
and exploring the city that will be your
home for the next four years.

One of Claude Monet’s waterlily paintings is among the highlights at the

Carnegie Museum of Art.

Cultural opportunities
abound in Pittsburgh

KAREN HINTZ
Contributing Editor

If you think ‘Pittsburgh lacks reﬁne-f

ment and that the peak of sophistication
here is Steelers fans drinking Iron City beer
at a football game, you’re mistaken. Both
the city and the University offer a remark-

able variety of art,‘ music and other cultural‘ ‘

venues.

On Forbes Avenue stands the Carnegie
Museum of Art, which houses one of the
widest—ranging collections in Pennsylvania.
Along with Impressionist paintings and
American and European art, the museum
has Japanese prints, African art and works
on paper. The white marble Hall of
Sculpture replicates the interior of the
Parthenon in Athens, Greece. In the Hall of
Architecture you will ﬁnd the largest col-
lection of plaster casts of architectural mas-
terpieces in the world. «

The museum also contains a cafeteria,
a gift shop and a cinema that shows ﬁlm
and video presentations. Next door, the
Carnegie Museum of Natural History is
renowned for its Dinosaur Hall but also has
exhibits ranging from anthropological phe-
nomena to minerals and gems to insects
and wildlife.

Pitt features two art galleries of its
own. The University Art Gallery, located in
the Frick Fine Arts building, displays draw-
ings, prints _and paintings by well—known
American and local artists. The Conney M.
Kimbo Art Gallery on the main ﬂoor of the
Wﬂliarn Pitt Union holds various art shows
sponsored by Pitt Program Council and
sometimes features student work , U

_ Popular Pittsburgh art galleries include
the Mattress Factory, with contemporary

art and large installation pieces, and the

Andy Warhol Museum on the North Side.
Dedicated to the area’s most -‘famous artist,
the Warhol contains about 500 of his color-
ful works, plus temporary exhibits.

The Stephen Foster Memorial, a his-
toric landmark located beside the

Cathedral, houses the Stephen Foster .

Museum and the Center for American
Music, a collection of antique instruments
and sheet music. Pitt’s theatre department
puts on shows in the Fo_ster’s proscenium
theater and in the new intimate Henry
Heyrnann Theatre downstairs.

Students in Pitt’s Repertory Theatre
regularly perform plays and musicals.
Theatre faculty assist the productions, labs
and workshops every semester. Another
performance group is the Kuntu Repertory
Theatre, an arena for black writers, actors
and directors. , A

Other theater venues in the Pittsburgh
area include the City Theatre in the South
Side and the'O’Reilly Theater, which is the
home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater,
located Downtown. Opened in December

' 1999, the O’Reilly.has 650 seats in a thrust

stage conﬁguration, allowing the audience
to enjoy performances from three sides of
the stage.

If you dig poetry, check out the
International Poetry Forum. Through the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, you can lis-

' ten to internationally recognized poets,

actors and musicians read their award—win—

ning p0ems-     A
Those who are musically inclined will

ﬂock Downtown to the Benedum Center

for the Performing Arts. The Pittsburgh

Ballet, Pittsburgh Dance Council and
Pittsburgh Opera perform here, as does the

Civic Light Opera, whose summer season .

of Broadway musicals includes
“Brigadoon,” “A Chorus Line” and “South
Paciﬁc.”

Heinz Hall is a majestic concert hall on

a Penn Avenue and is home to the Pittsburgh

Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra has a
yearly program of classical music, pops
and chamber music.

A perpetual slumber party favorite, this
coming-of-age story hit the theaters when
Tom Cruise was still riding high off of his
“Risky Business” tighty-whitey, butt-

steel town conﬁnes to go to college —- it’s .a
must-see for any die-hard Cruise fan.

Pittsburgh is typecast as other cities and

Greek life: more than just socializing

COLLEEN CLINTON

‘\

Most people picture parties and
pledging rituals when they think of
Greek life, and these traditions are
definitely a part of the Greek
lifestyle at Pitt. But fewer people
realize that Pitt’s fraternities and
sororities are philanthropic organiza-
tions as well. ” ' A

the governing body for sororities,
Greeks are some of the biggest con-
tributors_to charities on campus.

Busche said each house has a
specific charity that it collects funds
for each semester. In addition, during
Greek Week the entire Greek com-
munity raises money for a charity
chosen at the beginning of the semes~
ter. '

V Greek Week events include a
dancing/singing contest and a dance

marathon. Prizes are awarded and the
money raised goes to the selected

charity. All the money raised is pre-

' Each fraternity and sorority has a

Advice on learning to live witha stranger

DAN GROFT

Contributing Editor

You’ve just taken your clothes, com-

. puter, stereo, refrigerator, dishes, CDs, tele-

vision, VCR, videos and school supplies out
of the yellow cart you rented in the Towers
lobby. Now what?

Do yourself a favor and put everything
except your clothes and your computer back
into the cart and send all that stuff back
home -with Mom and Dad. Weeks from
now, you’ll be glad you did it.

If you brought all these appliances with
you to school, planning to share themwith
your roommate, you may be asking for trou-
ble.

Before you know it, he or she will be
slarmning the microwave door each time he
or she uses it, until the door won’t to open
anymore. Or you might ﬁnd your roommate
stocking your camping-size’ refrigerator
with PowerBars and tvvo-liter bottles of Diet
Coke, and watching endless episodes of
“Law and Order” on your television, while
coughinggall over your cordless phone.

Or perhaps you plarmed ahead, com-

promising with your roommate to deter--

mine who would bring what before coming
to Pitt. Kudos on the prep work, but in real-
ity, you’re probably not better off than the
fool who brought everything.

Your roommate may decide that he or

\ she wants to listen toihis or her stereo while

you’re trying to study. You fear that if you
ask him or her politely to put on head-
phones, you’re going to get the it’s-mir1e-I-
can-do-what-I—want reaction, especially if
you’re already sensing tension. The last
thing you want to do is exacerbate the situa-
tion between the two of you.

So what can be done to prevent this
from happening? The least you can do is
take the roommate contract that your resi-
dent assistant gives you seriously, and let
your roommate know from the start what
you like and don’t like.

Don’t push the seriousness aside by

planning to “wing it” later on. What are the

chances that you’ll be able to compromise
fairly when the time comes to “wing it?”
Not Very high, I’m afraid.

Also, don’t be too generous with your
stuff. Ifyour roommate asks to see your CD
collection, you might say, “Sure, any time.”
That inevitably translates to “sure, you can
look through them and take as many as
you’d like, especially if I’m not around.”

Your new roommate may seem friend-
ly and compromising at ﬁrst, but depending
upon your personalities and how the ﬁrst
few weeks go, you may both wind up agi-
tated by each other’s very presence. Despite
the preferences you selected when subrnit—
ting your housing paperwork, your interests

  
 
  

 

 

may not always correspond with your
roorr1rnate’s. . ‘ .

As you ‘begin living with your new
roommate, you will slowly discover a num-
ber of truths about him or her that may or
may not coincide with your beliefs and
tastes. Each passing day is like peeling an
onion. VV1th each layer removed, - you’re
closer to the core —- the true nature of your
roornmate’s being.‘ ,

Each day, you become more kr1owl—
edgeable about your roornrnate’s habits,
actions, opinions and so on. You might ﬁnd

 t that you have a lot in common, or you might

discover that you simply don’t.

It’s imperative that you make an effort
to work‘ out any differences or conﬂicts you
might have. If tension arises, swallow your
pride and work out your problems by dis-
cussing them. You’re going to spend a total
of eight months with this person, so you
need to establish common ground.

Classes will cause enough stress, and
roommate tension can be avoided. If you
ignore problems between you and your

A roommate, they won’t just go away. Instead,

they’ll fester until you’re so infuriated that
you blow up and say more than you intend-
ed to. Meanwhile, you’ve made a fool of
yourself and have only caused more aggra-
vation.

Ultimately, by setting your boundaries
from the start, you can save yourself ﬁom a
lot of hassles.

Pitt tradi

~. DAVID MCKENZIE

Contributing Editor

When a university reaches the ripe
old age of 214, as Pitt did in February,
it has likely acquired it's share of tradi-
tions. Some are relatively new and
others are practically ancient, but all
are an integral part of the Pitt experi-
ence.

- Naturally,. many traditions at Pitt
revolve around athletics. Athletics are
currently in a state of transition at the
moment. The football team will not
compete against its old rival Penn

   

THE Prrr NEWS - NEW STUDENT GUIIDE

State until 2008 and will be playing in
the new Steelers stadium on the North
Shore this year.

But these changes don’t mean that
the old traditions are dead.

Since 1893, Pitt football has had a
rivalry withPenn State. Although that
rivalry has died down in recent years,
since Penn State and Pitt no longer
play in the same conference, students
still rallied around the football team
each time it played the Nittany Lions,
chanting “Penn State sucks, Penn State
sucks, P—E-N—N—S—T sucks” to the tune
of Pitt’s fight song. '

In fact, Pitt students are apt to

chant the “Penn State sucks” cheer at
virtually any sporting event, regard-
less of who the opponent is.

The Panthers also have other
rivals. For years, Pitt and Notre Dame
have been battling it out on the foot-
ball field and the basketball court, and
Notre Dame was the football team’s
final opponent in Pitt Stadium. This
year, the Panthers will take on Notre
Dame in South Bend, Ind., once again.

In the absence of Penn State, Pitt’s
foremost rival is arguably West
Virginia University, located just 70

"miles away in Morgantown. Every

after Thanksgiving.

Last year, Pitt defeated WVU at
Three Rivers Stadium. This year, the
backyard brawl will take place at
Mountaineer Field in Morgantown.
Hick jokes run rampant on campus
around this time of year.

Pitt hosts a slew of Homecoming
festivities. Homecoming is when
alumni return to the University to meet
up with old friends and, with any luck,
watch the football team pound its
opponent. The festivities _include fire-
works on the Friday night preceding
the Saturday home football game.and
the election of a Homecoming court.

Joe Cavalla, director of student
activities, said Homecoming is a good
time for both alumni and students.

"This year, Homecoming will take

place Oct. 12-13, with the game
against Syracuse capping off the
weekend.

For decades now, freshman
women have had the chance to partici-
pate in Lantern Night. Held in Heinz
Chapel just before the beginning of the
first semester, the event gives fresh-

man women the opportunity to put on ,

semi-formal clothes and experience a
ceremony marking their entrance to
the University. '
More recently, the University
added a similar ceremony for male
freshmen, Night of the Panther. Held
at the same time as‘ Lantern Night,
male freshman who participate receive
nifty panther lapel pins. '
Another tradition in which many

students participate is the Honors
Convocation. Held every year on«or_

around Feb. 28 — the anniversaryof

the University’s founding -in 1787 -

this ceremony honors undergraduates,
graduates and faculty who have
received awards in the past year. '
One of Pitt’s newer traditions is
the Bigelow Bash, which Pitt Program
Council puts, on every year in April.
This event is a Saturday full of food
and music, capped off‘ with an end-of-
the-day outdoor - concert. In recent

_ years, bands such as The Clarks have

performed. __
Many of the schools“ at Pitt have

. their own traditions. For example,

every spring the _ School of
Engineering hosts E-Week, which pits

‘the various engineering disciplines

against each other in a variety of
wacky competitions, such as a ,_talent
show and balloon toss. I '
In addition, clubs and student
organizations also" have unique tradi-

' tions. Black Action Society, for exam-
ple, celebrates Martin Luther King ~

Day in January and Black History
Month in February, putting on shows,
hosting guest lect11rers and organizing

After procrastinating as long as
possible, junior Jennifer Hoffman likes
to buckle down in the quiet solitude of
her room. _. .

“‘I like to study there because
there’s good lighting and there’s not all
the distractions,” she said. “It’s ' just
more conducive to learning in your own
environment.”  '

But not everyone finds a peaceful
or productive study zone in his or her
room, especially if he or she lives in a

» dorm. Often times students- encounter _a

multitude of distractions, roommates in
particular.

. Sophomore James Martin said he

'can’t get any work done in his Forbes
Craig apartment because his roommates
are so distracting.

“Noisy!” he said about his room-
mates. “The one sleeps all the time and
the other listens to ESPN radio like it’s
a sermon.” _

Like manystudents, Martinescapes
to Hillrnan Library. He said his favorite
place to study is the fourth ﬂoor, facing
the parking lot.‘ “There are no stupid,
annoying people withicell phones,” he

V said. “The student constitution is most-
‘ ly grad students who are more serious

about their studies.” .

Gina Sciarrino prefers to study in
Hillrnan for similar reasons, but opts for
the third ﬂoor. ’ ' . i

,“There’s nobody there. It’s also
where I go because there are computers

and no one knows they’re there,” ‘

Sciarrino said. ,
In addition to appreciating the quiet
she finds in the library, Leah Seuss, a
senior, said she likes‘ to work there
because of “instant access to informa-

Another student favorite is the A

their favorite study places. In fact, the
Cathedral" was voted “Best Place to
Study during Finals” in a Pitt News
readers’ poll last N ovember,

Many» students spend most of -their

class time in the Cathedral, so it is not ,

surprising that the Cathedral Commons

— Room is always packed. Plenty of the

students seen working there will have
stopped at the Starbucks on the ground
ﬂoor before settling in.

On sunny days, many studious col-

‘ legians _are apt to populate Oakland’s ‘

grassy areas, from the Cathedral lawn
to Schenley Park.

“I just like to be outside, on the ‘

lawn. I get lots of energy from being in
the sun,” freshman Audrey Woosnam
said.

Kate Cosgrove, a sophomore, likes
to spend sunny days on Flagstaff Hill, a

‘large grassy area in Schenley Park,

located close to Carnegie Mellon
University’s campus. She said she likes
to pack up and spend entire Saturdays
there.

, Despite her love for the sun,
Cosgrove said the Starbucks on Forbes
Avenue is her favorite place to camp
out with a cappuccino and her books.
She remarked that she likes the cafe
atmosphere and constant ﬂow of peo-
ple. .

* “I« can’t study in silence,” she said.

“Plus, it really helps that there’s a con- _

stant supply of caffeine.”

Other students prefer more unusual

venues for studying, such as the bench-
es outside of -Phipps Conservatory and

. various area restaurants. ‘
Athea Thomas, said she» likes to A

hang out at Pamela’s, a diner—style

restaurant on Forbes Avenue, between »

classes. “I get some food. I sit there, eat
and study.” A‘

Regardless ‘of where a student.

chooses to study, there is ultimately
only one factor that -matters.

‘«‘The key.to studying effectively is
focus. It doesn’t matter where you
study as long as you get your work
done,” Woosnam said.

“I think freshmen should take a sernes

them, both personally and academically,” he

“Go to all the meetings you can,” Khan

Petersen Center

generates excitement 

BRIAN GOLDMAN

Staff Writer

Its opening might still be more than six
months away, but the effects of the John M.
and Gertrude E. Petersen Events Center are
already being felt by PitI’s students, staff and
sports teams.

The demolition of Pitt Stadium ended
an era and opened up the future for a more
modern arena to be built. With the Pitt foot-
ball team scheduled to play its games on the
North Shore in another brand new stadium,
the land that once was occupied by Pitt
Stadium became vacant.

“We had all this land to use,” said Marc
Boehm, Pitt executive associate athletic
director. ‘The land was there and the timing
was right for a new, more modem facility.”

The Petersen Center will be the home
for Pitt men’s and women’s basketball
teams. The center will seat approximately
12,500 fans, almost doubling the number of
spectator seats available in the Fitzgerald
Field House now. But basketball isn’t the

  

only event that will take place in the Petersen
Center. Pitt representatives are on the phones

and online, booking events to take place in

the new arena.

“The new center will hold graduations
and concerts as well as basketball games,”
Boehm said. “I imagine we will get some big
name people to perform.” .

Along with all the events that will take
place in the Petersen Center, the Center itself
will rarely have its doors closed. At any time
of the day, Pitt students will have access to
modern, high-tech weight rooms, food
courts, merchandise shops and even a Pitt
hall of fame.

“ThePetersenCenterwillbeagreat
recreation center for students,”

Boehm said. “This place is being built for the

students, and we want to
encourage them to come and check it out.”
A fear of building a convocation center
is the question of parking. Fitzgerald Field
House only seats about 6,000 fans, so park-
ing was never anissue, but now an events
center with more than 12,500 seats is being
built and will have to accommodate all the

drivers.

0 ‘ The University doesn’t ﬁnd this to be a
problem. No parking garages are even being
considered by University ofﬁcials.

“We have the OC lot, and parking to the
left of the stadium,” Boehm said “We got
more people into Pitt Stadium so parking
isn’t even an issue.” .

Not only are students and faculty excit-
ed about the new cornplex, but both Pitt has-

ketball teams are excited as well. Once in the -
Petersen Center, both basketball teams won’t

volleyball and gyrrmastics teams. The plan is
to keepthe Fitzgerald Field House for the
other Olympic sports, leaving the Petersen
Center for basketball teams only.

The projected completion date for the

Petersen Center is January 2002. Boehm
said he believes that the ﬁrst basketball
games will be played in the new facility,

starting with the 2002-03 season, 10 months ‘

So long. Farewell. Goodbye.

For the last time in the foreseeable
future, Joe Patemo and his Nittany Lions left
Pittsburgh Saturday with no bragging rights
and no points on the scoreboard as Pitt
trounced Penn State 12-0 in ﬁont of a crowd
of 61,221 at Three Rivers Stadium. _

“How ‘bout those Panthers!”- said head

’ V coach Walt Harris, who led Pitt to its ﬁrst vic-
, tory over the intrastate rival since 1988,
snapping a seven-game losing streak to Penn '

State in grand fashion.

‘On defense, ﬂie Panthers pressured the
Lions throughout the entire game, forcing
bad passes, containing the rtmning game and
accumulating ﬁve sacks.

_ Junior defensive end Bryan Knight had
three sacks and a tackle for a loss, highlight-
ing the shutout performance.

On the other side of the ball, the
Panthers were paced by redshirt freshman
Rod Rutherford.'Rutherford was utilized all
over the ﬁeld at quarterback, kick returner
and wide receiver, the position where he
broke the game open by weaving through
the Penn State defense for a 62-yard touch-
down reception. -

Barlow’s gains of 25, 21, and 10 yards
v aided a 62-yard drive that ended in a 29-yard
Nick Lotz ﬁeld goal putting the Panthers up
3-0.
The score remained the same until half-
time, when the Panthers led VV1tl'l an identical
3-0 score at the break

After receiving Penn State’s only kick- 9

off of the game, an 82—yarder that was
downed in the end zone by Rutherford for a
touchback, the Panﬂrer oﬁ"ense exploded at
the start of the third quarter. —

On the ﬁrst play of the opening drive of
the second half, Barlow found another hole

in the Penn State line and rushed 18 yards for ‘

aﬁrst down.

On the next" play, quarterback John
Turman threw a pass to Rutherford as he cut
across ﬂre middle of the ﬁeld.

' Rutherford evaded one defender, made
his way up the sideline, then back across the
ﬁeld and into the endzone for a 62-yard
touchdown as the Panthers needed a mere 45
seconds to corrrplete their scoring drive.‘ .

“I don’t think they were confused,” said

I Rutherford of the Lions defense which was- _ C

“It’s just that, how are you going to stop it?”

On the very next drive by Penn State,

Pirates comfortable in newhoe

KAREN BHELAK

- Contributing Editor

The "Pittsburgh Pirates may not have
one of the best records in major league

baseball, but they do have one of the best

stadiums. :

The Pirates welcomed a number of
changes to start the 2001 season, including
new manager Lloyd McClendon, but none
were as signiﬁcant as the team’s move to
its new home, PNC Park. —

' Located on the shore of the Allegheny
River, PNC Park is in no way comparable
to Three Rivers Stadium, where the Pirates
played for the past 30 years.

The cookie—cutter stadium, which
seated about 60,000 fans, was imploded in
February. The old stadium had artiﬁcial
turf and alienated baseball fans with an
environment that was better suited for the
Steelers games that were also played there.

In contrast, PNC Park seats slightly
more than 38,000, creating a cozy atmos-
phere appreciated by baseball fans and
making it the second—smallest stadium
after Boston’s Fenway Park

The stadium is located on Federal
Street on the North Shore just across the
parking lot from where Three Rivers once
stood. Fans coming from Downtown can

enter the stadium from the Roberto’

Clemente (Sixth Street) Bridge into the
main concourse.

PNC Park boasts natural grass and
resembles old-time ballparks with its
asymmetrical outﬁeld dimensions. It is a
mere 320 feet down theright ﬁeld line and
slightly farther, 325 feet, down the left-
ﬁeld line. Straightaway center is 399 feet
and the outfield fence peaks at 410 feet in
deep left center. The right-ﬁeld wall_ stands
at 21 feet to honor Pirate great Roberto
Clemente who wore jersey No. 21.

PN C Park’s intimacy results from its
two—tier design, with the highest seat being
just 88 feet from the ﬁeld, ensuring that
every fan has a great view. It is the ﬁrst sta-
dium to use this layout since Milwaukee’s
County Stadium opened in 1953. Seats
behind home plate are only 50 feet from
the batter’s box, while those along the
lines are just 45 feet from ﬁrst and third
base.

While ticket prices may be higher
than they were at Three Rivers, they are
still affordable, especially considering the
accommodations. Seating prices range
from $9 for left- or right-ﬁeld grandstand
seats to $35 for dugout boxes.

The stadium also does not disappoint
with its concessions, harboring a wide
variety of restaurants and beers that could
keep a fan busy for innings. Among the
attractions is an Outback Steakhouse
restaurant, located behind left ﬁeld.

Groundbreaking for PNC Park took
place on April 7, 1999, and ofﬁcial con-
struction began a week later. Less than two

years later, on March 3l, 2001, PNC Park
opened its doors for the ﬁrst time for an
exhibition game. against the National
League Champion New York. '

Mike Piazza hit the ﬁrst home run in
the new stadium to lead the Mets to a 4-3
victory. The Pirates may have come up
short on the scoreboard, but the event was
nonetheless a huge win for the team and
the city of Pittsburgh, as it went oﬁ with

 

s- w

If you listen closely enough...

the need for only minor adjustments.

The Pirates played their ﬁrst ofﬁcial 1

game at PNC Park on April 9, 2001, host-
ing the division rival Cincinnati Reds.
Though the Pirates lost the game 8-2, it is
undisputed that the opening of the stadium
has_ brought excitement back to Pirate
baseball, and has given baseball fans
everywhere a beautiful new place to see a
game.

THE PIIT NEWS - NEW STUDENT GUIDE

SUlVIl\/IER, 2001

City boasts four pro sports teams

MATT MILOSZEWSKI

Staff Writer

Pittsburgh is home to four pro-
fessional sports teams, three major-
league teams and one minor—league
team, options to appease any sports
fan’s liking.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are the
professional football team in town,
and they will begin the season this
fall at their new stadium on the
North Shore, which has yet to be
named. In fact, the stadium is locat-
ed right next to the spot where Three

Rivers Stadium, the Steelers’ former
home, which was_ imploded in
February. '

Coming off of a 9-7 season, the
Steelers will look to get back into
the playoffs after a two-year
absence. The team had reached the

postseason for six consecutive sea-

sons until its recent faltering.

Kordell Stewart returns at quarter-
back, and the Steelers re—signed run-
ning back Jerome “The Bus” Bettis
in hopes that his running game will
help open things up for Stewart and
the young receiving corps.

The Penguins, owned by player

Mario Lemieux, are Pittsburgh’s
representative in professional hock-
ey. Known to locals affectionately
as the Pens, they play their home
games at the Mellon Arena
Downtown‘. .

Under Lemieux’s leadership, the
Penguins hope to return to their
Stanley Cup championship years of
the early 1990s and have maintained
a streak of 12 consecutive playoff
appearances.

Mellon Arena seats about 17,000
people, and the Penguins have a stu-
dent rush program that sells tickets
for $20. Students can purchase these

discount tickets at Mellon Arena an
hour before game time or at Music
X on Forbes Avenue after the com-
pletion of the previous game.

The Penguins’ exciting brand of
hockey features some of the
league’s most explosive and high-
scoring players. Winger Jaromir
Jagr led the NHL in scoring again
this year, and assisting Jagr was

newly unretired owner Lemieux..

The third-ranking offensive threat
the Penguins have is Alexei
Kovalev, who enjoyed a breakout
season this year and received MVP
attention. ‘

Pittsburgh’s professional base-
ball team is the Pirates, who are also
the city’s oldest franchise. After
more than 30 years in Three Rivers
Stadium, the l13—year-old team has
a‘ new home in PNC Park.

The new stadium, which sports

‘natural grass, is located on the

North Shore of Pittsburgh. The
Pirates have been known as a.small—

market team and are hoping that the _'

additional revenues from the new
stadium will pay off. ‘

With a new inﬂux of money with
which to work, general manager
Cam Bonifay will have a shot at
keeping the high-profile players that
the Pirates used to lose to free
agency. _ '

With the hiring of new coach
Lloyd McClendon' and the contract
extensions of outfielder Brian Giles
and catcher Jason Kendall, Pirates

owner Kevin McC1atchy is looking.

to restart the winning tradition of
the Pirates.

The professional soccer team in
Pittsburgh is the Riverhounds. The
minor-league team came to the city
in 1999 and recently drafted Pitt
standout Ben Garry. After making
the playoffs in , 1999, the
Riverhounds went 1,0-14-4 in 2000

and fell short of making the play-_

offs. ’

The ‘Hounds are looking to
build a new stadium for themselves,
but until. then the team willcontinue
to play at Bethel Park High School

in the South Hills. Tickets prices

range from $8-10.

Most people think of the college week

schedule on certain Satmdays for something
that maybe as much of a University institu-

THE,Prrr NEWS - NEW STUDENT GUIDE-

SUMMER, -2001

llnaking the m0

I think I know how you might feel
right now. I remember being incredi-
bly freaked out at my Advising
Testing Registration session.
Surrounded by hundreds of strangers,
it hit me that I would be spending the
next year of my life in a wedge-
shaped room only slightly larger than
a closet with a girl
from Mississippi who I KATE
had never met before.

Here are a few
pieces of advice to help
you through those first
few weeks of school. After that, I’m
sure you won’t need much help. You
will adjust faster than you thought
was possible, and your freshman year
will ﬂy by.

- Get involved. I can’t stress this

"one enough. Go to the Student

Activities Fair and put your name on
every list they have. Joining agroup is
the quickest way to make friends.
There are literally hundreds of -organi-
zations to choose from. I have fond
freshman year memories of passing
out ﬂiers for Ralph Nader with the
Campus Greens and building houses
with Habitat for Humanity.

- Explore Oakland. There are tons
of cool restaurants and stores within a

GIAMMARISE

S'r/trr‘ VVRITER

 

few blocks from your dorm. I made
getting ice cream from Dave and
Andy’s a regular part of my freshman
year routine. When I got tired of C-
Side Cafeteria I ate dinner at Lu Lu’s
Noodles. I also recommend checking
out Oakland landmarks like “Dippy,”
the dinosaur at the Carnegie Museum,
the
Schenley Park and
Phipps Conservatory.

0 When you’re done
exploring
explore the rest of
Pittsburgh. Go shopping Downtown.
Eat lunch in Shadyside. As Pitt stu-
dents, we’ve been blessed with free
transportation in the form of access to
an extensive bus system.

- Do something cultural once in a
while. Take advantage of the Carnegie
Museum —— it’s right down the street
on Forbes Avenue and it’s free. If that
doesn’t grab you, try -the Andy Warhol
Museum or the Heinz History Center.
You can also take advantage of the
free and low—cost programs that Pitt
Arts offers. .

i - Don’tskip class. As tempting as
it may seem to not go to that 500-per-
son Intro to Psychology lecture, skip-

" ping can quickly become a bad habit.

playground in ‘

Oakland, '

If it helps, remind yourself that you
are paying a lot of money -for the
opportunity to take classes.

0 Watch out for the salespeople in
front of the William Pitt Union. I
don’t mean people like the guy who
sells posters or used CDs, I mean the
ones selling credit cards. They prey on
naive college students with little to no
income. It’s easier than you think‘ to
get into debt.

- One of the things I dreaded most
about coming to school was doing my
own laundry for the first time. It’s not
too hard as long as you remember to
separate the whites and darks. Also,
things are more likely to shrink when
you wash them in hot water, so when
in doubt, use cold. ' _

- I remember being shocked at the
number of people asking for change
on Forbes Avenue. "If you Want to,
give your spare change to the panhan-
dlers. Don’t let your cynical friends
tell you that they don’t‘ need it or
should just get a job. Obviously you
don’t have to give anyone money, but
know that you can make an informed
personal decision about this.

- Think before you get any body
piercings. If you feel that your college
experience will not" be complete

st of the freshman experience

unless you put an extra orifice some-

’ where on your body, at leastmake

sure you go someplace that’s clean.
Also, if you think you will be able to
hide a belly button ring from your
mother, you’re wrong. Trust me on
that one. '

- You’re going to be able to drink
and go to parties a lot more than

you’re used to. Have fun, but in mod-

eration. .
- If you have a question, just call

624-FACT. They know everything. '

Really. ~

- Take the time every once in a
while to go stand in the commons
room of the Cathedral and marvel at
how lucky you are to have access to
higher learning. Only. an extremely
small percentage of the world’s peo-
ple go to college. _—

These next four years are going to
be _a unique opportunity in your life —

you will be free to think and question. I
This’ will likely pbe‘the only .time in‘
A your life when you will be so open to

new ideas or have so many opportuni-
ties for learning, travel and friendship.

Kate Giammarise warns you that your
freshman year will go by faster than
you think. ‘

Pitt a|um’s humble advice: Getinvolved now

In the course of my time at Pitt, I have occasionally
offered advice to friends who have had some difﬁculties
adjusting to the social scene. Some were freshmen, rook-
ies to the college life. Others were transfer students who
perhaps did not have the energy to go through

making a new set of friends for the second  
. /

time in a few years.

So I would like to humbly offer to
you the same piece of advice that I
have given to my closest
friends: Join a student activ-
ity.

One of the outstanding
qualities of this University is
the sheer multitude of
options it offers. Not only do _
the course manuals have far

take, but there is also a considerable num- ,
ber of student organizations that could inter-

est you.

This may actually intimidate some people. -
But joining a group really is not difficult. Stop by

ﬁrst ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union andpick a
pamphlet that lists all of the registered student
groups on campus. Take some time to choose the
groups that interest you. From there, either meet
some of these people at the Student Activities Fair,

or call or e-mail them to ﬁnd out when the group

meets .

I have been an advocate. of joining student activities
since I went to my ﬁrst rehearsal of the Heinz Chapel
Choir more than three years ago. Since then, I have joined

Before I go any further, let me explain that I am not
promoting involvement in multiple groups. That
is a path I took, and I had to sacriﬁce time that
could have otherwise been spent on
schoolwork, relation- R
ships, learning how
to shotgun a beer in"
less than four sec-
onds and so on.

Also, I am not sug-
gesting thatvyou commit all of your
_ . energy to the group you choose. I

'   " group, at whatever level of com-
mitment you desire, is a necessary
' and helpful aspect of the collegiate

Since it was the first group with which I
became involved, allow me to explain how the

I heard the choir sing before, and when I saw a sign for it
‘9 '*‘_ on a table during the Student Activities Fair in the
'  beginning of the semester, I signed up to try out.

I remember everything about the ﬁrst rehearsal,
even which person I was sitting next to and what we were
singing. We started 011' as strangers, but instantly and nat-
urally, we were working together. We had the same goal. '

. And I think it is deﬁnitely possible to make friends in '
the classroom. When you sit next to someone or are paired '
with a person, or if you recognize someone from a class
you were in together before, small talk can
easily lead to a friendship. But for_ me it’s
much easier to converse with people in 'a les
formal setting. 4 -

If you wish to take‘ your involvement

further and become a ‘leader of your organiza- -
tion, you will meet other student leaders, opening yourself
up to an entirely diﬁerent group of potential friends. .
Try it out. And if you don’t like the group, well, ‘the

is very true, but it should not be your motivation. 
It’s safe to assume that employers’ smiles would be
even broader if they saw that you have won a prestigious
scholarship than if you are the business manager of the
botany club. So if enhancing your resume is your fore-
most goal, maybe you should spend most of your time in

Succeeding in college is simply a matter of balancing
all of the things you ‘want to do, with your responsibilities.
If you can strike that balance, you will truly live out the
fabled “best days of your life.” - _ -
