Students across all five Pitt cam-
puses were unable to use on-campus
computers and Internet connections
for more than nine hours yesterday.

According to Jinx Walton from
Computer Services and Systems
Development, the outage ‘began at
approximately 6:30 a.m. Pitt’s depart-
ment of network services worked all
day to correct the problem. Walton
said campus computers were working
again by about 4 p.m., although some
students were still reporting lingering
e-mail difficulties at 9 p.m. last night.

The cause of the outage was
apparently a routing protocol prob-
lem. Walton said network services
was still trying to determine whether
the problem originated from a hard-
ware or software malfunction. Once it
is determined where the problem
originated, Walton said network ser-
vices will make every effort to make
sure the problem doesn’t occur again.

“They are aware of how severe
this problem. is and how it affects
people,” she said. “They are doing
everything they can to make sure it
doesn’t happen again.”

Walton said that the network had
been experiencing some problems
earlier in the week. A number of stu-
dents reported slow access to the
Internet Monday evening, but the net-
work didn’t actually shut down.

Sophomore Sarah Grant said the
disruption was, a slight inconve-
nience. ’

Lingering problems were still

preventing Grant from accessing her I

off—campus e-mail account at 9 p.m.
yesterday.
Pete Walsh did have one good

thing to say about the networking

problems. The sophomore informa-

tion science major works for Resnet, ,
but got the day off because of the

shutdown. \

But even Walsh found the shut-
down to be a problem, as he couldn’t
access his e-mail account. “It wasn’t
a big deal, it was mainly just an
inconvenience,” he said. »

Students warned of rapist

TATIANA ZADONY

alert.

Staff Writer

Pitt police, Sexual Assault Services and the vice
provost and dean of student affairs all have the same
message for students: Be aware of your surroundings
at all times.

A crime alert was recently posted in residence
halls and off-campus facilities informing students of
four rapes that occurred during the summer and urging
students to use precautionary measures. The sexual
assaults occurred in Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Edgewood
and Swissvale and are thought to have been committed
by the same person. r A ‘

According to Deborah Furka, the University’s

chief of police, all of the information that the police .

wanted the‘ public to know was released in the crime

“Crime alerts are put there to heighten awareness
and give direction, information and guidance,” Furka
said.

The Pitt police. and the office of student -affairs did
not want to sensationalize the issue or cause alarm

within the Pitt community, but they attempted to

inform and promote awareness about the issue.

, Dr. Sharon Johnson, vice provost and dean of stu-
dents, said that it’s not a good idea to walk around
Pittsburgh at night alone or leave doors and windows
unlocked. Keeping the student body informed is very
important, especially “for the new students who have
never livedin a city before. 3

Another resource for students who would like
more information is the Sexual Assault Center in
Room 4926 of the William Pitt Union. The center is
open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

‘Students can pick up ﬂiers on a variety of topics

including date rape drugs, medical attention and
straight talk for men about rape. Students can make
one-on-one or group appointments with Mary Koch
Ruiz, coordinator of sexual assault services.

In dealing with rape situations, very little informa-
tion is given to the public in order to protect the vic-
tim’s feelings and identity. Ruiz explains to the student
all of his or her medical and police options.

Ruiz also coordinates peer education programs,
where students undergo a semester of training on sex-
ual assault, dating and building stronger relationships.

Integrity. Excellence.’ Service before
self. These are just a few of the Values cen-
tral to the Air Force ROTC.

Recruitment Squadron Commander
Shawn Daniel described the ROTC program

5 as more of a‘ lifestyle. “[ROTC] is learning

how to be a leader — how to run the show,”
he said. " \
Leadership is not the only reason that
Daniel turned to ROTC. He said the Air
Force has given him more security about his
future. “It [allows me] to be a part of

something that’s positive, and it has strength-
ened my character,” Daniel said 7

Daniel is not a traditional student. After
leaving college once, he retnmed to Pitt and

«met Capt. Wayne “ ne” Mattingly, unit

admissions officer, and joined ROTC.
Daniel said that he now has better grades.
He said that many people have miscon-
ceptions about the Air Force. “You don’t
need to have perfect eyesight, or want be a
pilot, or even be a science or engineering
major to join,”v he" said,  to some

Daniel, a communications major, is
interested in computer science for graduate .
school, 75 percent of which ROTC will have
paid for upon completion of his four years of
service. He described other ﬁnancial beneﬁts

» that students in ROTC receive during their

undergraduate years. ‘

United Campus Ministry

Life as a cadet  

   
 

Scholarships ranging front $15,000 to
full rides, money for books and $200 of
monthly spending money “are just the ﬁnan-
cial beneﬁts,” Daniel said. A

The “smooth ride,” Daniel said of ~

ROTC, “is that I don’t need toistress out like
my friends who are looking for jobs, because
I already have one waiting for me whenl
ﬁnish.” ' '

Senior Wing Commander Michael
Stock said that ROTC has taught him to hane
dle stressful situations with a clear mind He
said, “It’s a challenge being ir1 charge of
about 90 cadets, canying 23 credits and
being an RA, but I have learned time man'-
agement skills that I can apply to my life.”

For Stock, the Air Force ROTC is more
than just a job commitment. “It’s like a fam-
ily,” he said. “Everyone sticks together and
we have a like mind and attitude. We are
leaders in all we do.” ‘

“We have opportunities to meet people,

go overseas, attend jump school and be -

shadow assistants. [ROTC] is like an intern:
shiptoseeifthisiswhatyouwanttiodo,”
said  Burkey, vice wing comman- 3
der. Both Burkey and Stock are attending
ﬂight school" to get private pilot licenses
through the ROTC. '  , '
ROTC students undergo intensive»
physical conditioning during ﬁeld 
after their ﬁrst two years and have a- ﬁtness ’
test every semester. Yet they do know how to

relax and have fun. “We enjoy doing things -

like skydiving, laser tag, paintball and ﬂag
footb ” Daniel said » -

Pitt plans more buses for PSU

Pitt’s parking and transportation
department has added another alterna-
tive for students to leave Three_Rivers

Stadium after the game against Penn.

State on Saturday. .
According to John Morgan, assis-
tant director for transportation services,
15 buses will ‘be available on Liberty
Avenue just outside Point State Park.
“Students can- just walk over the
footbridge after the game, head through

.the park and get on a bus,”_Morgan
said. “We just want to give them more 4

options.” , T .

Morgan said the Downtown buses ‘

should return to Oakland very quickly,
since there are only three traffic lights

"on the Boulevard of the Allies and then

a short trip on the Parkway.

Police will be along the walkway .

and in the park to help direct foot traf-

ﬁc. Cards will again be handed out to,

help students navigate their way back to
Oakland. , -

BAS holds activities fair

MICHELLE SHIN
Staff Writer

As part of a week—long series of
events, the Black Action Society
sponsored, an activities fair in the
William Pitt Union Tuesday.

The Black Student Activities
Fair was one of the many events
BAS planned for Homecoming
Week. Students who attended the
fair came together to find food,
music, free T—shirts and plenty of
information on the many student
activities geared towards black stu-
dents. 0

Executive assistant Shaun
Plummer said he felt there was a
need to hold an activities fair
geared specifically to black stu-
dents.

“At the regular activities fair
there were so many people, so many
organizations that you kind of get
lost in the fold,’’ Plummer said.

BAS felt thatholding the Black
Student Activities Fair in addition
to the regularly scheduled campus

‘ activities fair would_be helpful to
black students.

Plummer ‘said the fair was espe- -

cially geared toward freshmen who
are interested in becoming involved

RAPIST  

Then the students give speeches to
Residence Life, Freshman Studies,
the Interfraternity Council and other
interested organizations. Each peer
educator averages about 60 presen-
tations a year. T -

Ruiz gives some basic advice for
dealing with sexual assault situa-
tions. She instructs students ‘ to
assess the situation, and if they
believe they won’t be in physical
danger, t-ry to getout of the situation

by running, screaming or shouting
“fire.” Some victims use passive
resistance by telling the rapist she
has an STD or is menstruating.

“If the person is armed, .. then
don’t. You have to consider your
life,-” Ruiz said. ,

' A composite sketch of the rapist

stress the sketch is ambiguous. « -
“Composites help distinguish
who the assailant isinot, but not nec-

essarily who it is,”vsaid Timothy A

Delaney, commander of the Pitt
Police. T -
‘‘Everyone’s perception is a real-

ity, but how you see it is how you’

see it,”_agrees Furka. “It’s notTsay-
ing the reality was not correct, it’s

just how they saw it at the -time.’’,

with black organizations.

“They might not know that
there are black organizations that
are there for them as a support sys-
tem,” he said.

A number of ' organizations
passed out information at Tuesday’s
fair. ‘ -

Among them was Anointed

Steps of Faith, which is a Christian

step team that became an official
organization this year.

Anointed Steps of Faith will
perform in front of the William Pitt

Union on, Sunday. Their perfor— ,

mance will be held in conjunction
with a cookout on the WPU patio;

' The Black ‘Dance Workshop

viding students with information on

As Mike Varshine turned the corner
from Bayard Street onto Dithridge

block from his car, he could see that his
brake lights were on. I

“I ran after it, but I couldn’t catch

up,” said Varshine, who had just left a
fraternity meeting. “They’d already
taken off with Junior.”

Junior, Varshine’s red 1990 Pontiac

Varshine’s opinion that student
parking in Oakland is unsafe and incon-
venient is one shared by many students
who choose to keep cars at school.

“When my brother was here, his car

. was broken into also,” Varshine said.

“Parking here is unsafe, but ifI lived on
campus I would never pay so much
money to park in one of the school’s
lots.” - ‘

The OC lot and Towerview parking
garage, located near Trees Hall and the
Cost Sports‘ Center, are two places
where many campus residents are per-

kéi’ ' "

mitted to park. They are both far from
most residence halls, with the exception
of Sutherland, and can cost up to $300
per semester. ‘ .

Another resident student parking.

lot is located behind Forbes Hall, but it
is often difficult for Forbes residents to
get permits to park there. Christina
Solomon, a junior who now lives off
campus, could"never get a spot behind
Forbes Hall, even after living there for
two years.

“It was so inconvenient for me to

' run up to Towerview every time I need-

ed my car,” Solomon said. “Then I had
to get it out every Friday afternoon and

put it back every morning because I
couldn’t go in and out on the week-
ends.”

Between weekends, classes -and
working, Solomon did not always have
adequate time to find a legal parking
space and received about $500 in park-
ing tickets on top of what she was
already paying for her spot in
Towerview. ‘

Varshine also had eight parking
tickets, which were reduced after he
fought them in court.

“Now I don’t have a, problem,”
Solomon said. “I’ve “saved a lot‘ of
money and I can park wherever I want.
I‘ know it’s more dangerous here, that’s
why I have an alarm system/and The
Club.” I
Solomon still thinks that there

should be more parking options closer -‘

to residence halls, although she does
not know -where there would be room

- for another lot or garage in Oakland. '

Jan Thomas, the assistant director
for parking, said that all campus resi-
dents must apply for parking in advance
and that spots are given on a first-come,
first—served basis. That is why so many
students cannot park closer to their
dorms and others are placed on waiting
lists. 

“Our total «number of spaces is '

about 4,600, including faculty and
staff,” Thomas said. “Because our

demand exceeds our supply, we like to

encourage everyone/to either leave their

cars at home, or for commuters, find an 

alternative way» to campus like Port
Authority, Pitt’s van and carpool pro-

grams, or even biking.”

Thomas added that other than the
Multi~Purpose Academic Complex,
which is presently under construction
on Forbes between South Bouquet,
Street and Oakland Avenue, there are no V
plans to construct more parking lots.

N Because so many people park ille-
gally, Pitt strictly enforces parking tick-
ets and booting cars. A car can get the
boot any time after its driver has

- received four tickets or $100 in fines.

Parking enforcement can also tow the
car or prohibit students from registering
for classes if they do not pay their fines.
For many students, parking in ,
Oakland is a nightmare, but Solomon is

still thankful that she can have her car at ‘

school. A

‘‘I wasn’t going to leave my car at
home,” Solomon said. “I paid for it
myself and I wanted '-to use it. It’s also
good that I was able to have it here as a
freshman. I don’t think many schools
permit that.” ,

Even Varshine, who is extremely-
protective of Pip, Junior’s replacement,
agrees that there are beneﬁts to having
a car at school. ' A

“Parking is inconvenient, but hav-

Sing" a car here_ is not,” Varshine said. “I,

OPINIONS  

EDITORIAL

  Crashing computers may

be a blessing in disguise

 Much to the annoyance of
anyone who tried to type a paper at
a lab or surf the Internet yesterday
between the hours of 6:30.a.m. and
4:30 p.m., the Pitt network was
down. Feelings of panic and refer-
ences to the situation as crisis

. material abounded in the hearts

and brains of technology lovers
everywhere, as student after stu-
dent was tumed away from the

non-functioning labs, their hopes

of sending an e—mail, having an e-
chat, performing -an _e-anything

completely shattered.

 Luckily, this unfortunate inci-
dent taught most of us a valuable
lesson: that life really does go on
without computers. Computer
inaccessibility is a blessing of
sorts. It forces one to relax, to do
something fun instead, maybe
even something outdoors; or else it
forces one to embark on an excit-
ing challenge, to accomplish said
c0mputer—oriented task sans com-
puter.

The Intemet—less might have
used yesterday to enjoy the crisp
September air, catch up on read-
ing, get some exercise or sleep, the
universal favorite.

If communication was really
of the essence, students might

have tried spending ,a few bucks
on alow-rate phone card and actu-
ally calling‘ their friends. Or they
could have visited their professors
during ofﬁce hours and experi-
enced the ‘human touch in lieu of
using e—mail to contact them.

_ Those who wished to conduct
research using the Internet might
have instead made friends with our
helpful librarians. _And 'it__ is our
hope that professors were patient

with students who were forced to

hand-write papers and projects.

In the face of computer t:rau— '

ma, it’s important to keep perspec-
tive and realize that Pitt’s comput-
er system is actually pretty decent._
Our. servers are relatively speedy,
we have ample computing facili-
ties and such massive network
shutdowns are rare occurrences.

The servers at a lot of other

schools are much slower, and
some universities, such as Virginia
Tech, do not even have computer
labs. .

Still, no one has it as bad as
Penn State, where “advanced com-
munication” has something to do
with branding messages onto the
hides of moving cows, a practice
that is both cruel and inefficient.
They really suck.

that supposed to mean? Because
they are considered “laborers” (who tend to sup-
port the Democratic Party) and not white-collar

professionals (who tend to support the _

Republican Party), they shouldn’t be allowed to
voice their opinions at a political event? Such
ignorance makes me ill. Does being a “laborer”
mean that you can’t take an aftemoonoif or that
you don’t manage your own time?

In my opinion, Havens and anyone else who
would allow  to representhis or her views
(e.g. the College Republicans) should consider
what happens if Gore is elected-president." Do
they really believe the country would be in the

hands of extremists? Certainly, no logic would

dictate that. This makes-it sound as if Gore and
other Democrats are anarchists or socialists, try-

ing to dismantle the state as we knowit.»

I_et’s get somebalance here. How about if
all sides stop insulting people on the grounds of
character and start debating the issues? I would

love to have read Havens’ opinionson the issues,

even if they‘ differed from mine. It would have
been a big step up from insulting the opposition. /
Maybe Havens should have-considered that his
statements implied he had nothing substantive to
say about the race. A

The Pltt News

When prompted with the phrase “monster truck,” I am

_ struck with imagery both cheesy and strangely _nostalgic. As

children, my friends and I had small, battery-powered mon-

" ster truck toys. Redneck culture was dispensed via ‘The
‘ Dukes of Hazzard” and the overtly gratuitous rumblings of

Saturday moming.monster truck  These shows were
awe-inspiring, ranking in programming history right
alongside “American Gladiators.” ' V 
Lucky for me the Carnegie, Science
Center has just added a new attraction: -
a monster truck and roller coaster sim-
ulator, a 21st century virtual version of 2’
pre-adolescent ridiculous fantasy.

 

The Science Center is just the place for

, grown—ups who miss playing with toys, a giant
‘ romper room replete with a giant lunchroom-style cafeteria

on the bottom ﬂoor and a variety of interactive toys mas-
querading as science.

.T‘ne\simu1ators look like giant egg cartons, but with
room for only two eggs — lucky for me I brought a date. The
cartons split horizontally in the middle with a single door that
opened up Dolorean style. ,

I was sadly informed that my monster truck" passenger

on a track on an island As two employ-
ees of the Science Center were on the ride
ahead of us; we watched television
screens depicting the course they were

upside down. I couldn’t wait. '
Once inside, we were strapped in
and ourisland was projected on a screen
in front of; us. The ride started and sud-
denly we were out of control. I couldn’t
accomplish anything with the wheel or
the pedals, and I couldn’t even stay on the
racetrack I started looking for trees and
hillsides to drive into, hoping to

‘ wreck of burning
ﬂames, submerged
in water, broken into
srnithereens. No use
simulating the mundane, that’s what
suburbia is for. Eventually the ride ends,
but I could have done this all day long. _
A Next we were off to the roller coaster sirn—
ulator. One of the ride options is the Steel Phantom from
Kennywood Park —-the real one is to be dismantled, the vir-
tual one just designed to keep nostalgia alive. This was all
warm and cozy, but I wanted to design my own roller coast-
er. My girlfriend and I programmed in ﬂip after ﬂip after
loop, and then programmed it to go backwards, just to shake
things up. I really wanted to go upside down, and my dreams
were totally fulﬁlled

The call to arms for the aging indie

response: “GBV! GBV! GBV!” In

a Pavlovian exercise. People

from the opening of the

Guided By Voices is the
brainchild of Dayton, Ohio,
native Bob Pollard. Although usually
having around ﬁve members, GBV is
his band, his outlet for creativity.
Because of this, the band has gone
through more lineup changes than
“Kids Incorporated.” The current mem-
bers include ex-Cobra Verde guitarist
Doug Gillard and ex—Breeders drummer

is the short song. All Pollard needs is a .
vocal or instrumental riff, or even just a
song title, and he can create an entire
tune. This makes him one of the most
prolific songwriters of the past 50 years.
Pollard said that he can write ﬁve songs
while using the bathroom and three of
them will turn out to be good.
Recently, the band has abandoned

their fan base. However, the abstruse

Some‘ rhetorical
questions on the
world of sports‘

This week’s rant consists of alook at
this weekend’s big game at Three Rivers,
a look at Dennis Miller’s work on
Monday Night Football and some

rhetorical questions.

.0 First off, some rhetorical questions:
Is Bobby Knight God?
How inept did he make Jeremy

Schapp look?

Was Ralph Willard a candidate for

Knight’s job?

Does anybody care for Dennis

Miller?

Does watching Monday Night

Football now require a dictionary?
How dumb is Darryl Strawberry?
Does JoePa’s recent whining have
anything to do with his team’s 1-2

record?

Will Ramon Walker be rusty

Saturday?

/.

Who will start at quarterback?

Does it matter?

Will Pitt be 3-0 going into the

Rutgers game?

Do you believe?
Are you ready?

- Since ABC announced that Miller
would join Dan Fouts andAl Michaels in
the Monday Night Football booth, there
has been a steady ﬂock of controversy
surrounding the decision.

It is clear that Miller still hasn’t
gathered his bearings within the three-
man team and is still ﬁshing for his

niche.

It is very possible that Miller will not
ﬁnd a comfort zone in this ﬁeld.

Miller has done over 100 shows on
his HBO series, “Dennis Miller Live.”
He produces his show, which cultivates

all of his talents.

The show has political subject mat-

Pitt's Chad Porter took five shots.

MARIO MACHI
Sports Editor

Last week, Pitt’s Chris Churchill
was honored as the Big East co—defend-
er of the week. But yesterday, Churchill
proved that he can play offense, too.

_ Churchill recorded his first Panther
goal just over 24 minutes into the game
to 1 put Pitt ahead, allowing the No. 18
Panthers to stretch their season-opening
winning streak to four games with a 3-
0 win over Duquesne at Shaler Area
High School. _

The 4-0 start is Pitt’s best since
1986, when the Panthers started the sea-
son by winning ﬁve straight games.

‘ Sophomore goalie Justin Gaul, who
was named goalkeeper of the week by
the conference for his performance last
week, made six saves to record his sec-
ond straight shutout. ,

 Churchill’s goal was unassisted as
the junior got the ball in front of the net
after a corner kick and blasted a shot
past Duquesne goalkeeper Terry

McNelis.
The Panthers were up 1-0 at the
half, but two scores made in the second

‘ half by forward Ben Garry sealed the

victory.
At the 68-minute mark, Garry
headed a ball past McNelis after a nice

' pass from Spencer Barton on a free

kick. Barton’s assist was his third this
year.

Just 11 minutes later at the 79:17
mark, Garry put Pitt up by three goals
with a shot from the left side of the box
about 10 yards away. The goals were

. Garry’s first two of the season.

The Panthers dominated all around,
taking 18 shots to Duquesne’s 12. Pitt
attempted four corner kicks, while the
Dukes did not try any. ,

There was only one yellow card
issued, and it went to Duquesne’s Mike
Baleno in the 70th minute of the game.
The fouls were fairly even, with Pitt

"being called for 17, while Duquesne

was cited 15 times. However, 10 of

Editor’s note: This is the third in a “Greatest Games” series
that will appear in The Pitt News the day before each Pitt foot-
ball game, except for the Penn State game. This week, the three
greatest games against the Nittany Lions will be reprinted.
Each part in the series will detail Pitt’s greatest game against
that week’s opponent, and will contain the original game story
as it appeared in The Pitt News. This story was written by Matt
Martin and was published Nov. 14, 1988.. ’

You might have called it a defensive struggle —— a repeat of
last year’s Pitt-Penn State game at Pitt Stadium.

You might have called
it a cliffhanger, an edge-
of-the—seat, hair—pulling ’
brawl on the natural grass
of Beaver Stadium.

Call it what you like,
but call it a 14-7 Pitt victo-
ry over the Nittany Lions
Saturday evening before a
national viewing audience

 

85,701, the sixth-largest attendance ﬁgure %ever at Beaver
Stadium.

Pitt’s fourth consecutive victory pushed its record to 6-3
and the team toward what is becoming an elusive bowl situa-
tion, while Penn State fell to 5-5 and, with next week’s game
against No. 1 and undefeated Notre Dame, dangerously close
to its ﬁrst losing season in 23 years under coach Paterno.

“One of the things I was thinking aboutijicoming up here

was our young players,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried said. “I was

concerned about
the stadium here,
[and] how we
would play on
the road after
seven home
games. I felt that
if we could win
this game up
here, it would be
a giant step for
us.”

Lest you for-
get, this was a
game neither
team could
afford to lose -
“This game is
played like the.
Super Bowl,”
said Pitt fresh-
man linebacker
Curtis Bray. With possible bowl bids waiting in the wings and,
above all, the opportunity to beat archrival Penn State,
Gottfried had reason to worry about his young players.

But it was the Panthers’ younger players — if they can
indeed be termed that after nine games — that sealed Pitt’s sec-
ond victory over Penn State in as‘many years. ”' ‘

Miller’s opening rant, an interview with the guest. of the

The show is directed toward a sophisticated crow

The Monday ‘night ‘show is a prime-time football
show. It has a tradition unmatched by any spo1ts—orient-’
ed show to this date. ,

Miller has been unable to reach the show’s audience

But then it happened. The camera slowly but sure-
ly focused away from Michaels and Fouts and cruised
toward Miller’s gray beard. _

And then the unthinkable happened. Miller began
to rant. Before the Rams and Broncos had evenbegrm

Miller had already lost them. »

What’s even worse is that the ratings are dropping.

The defense’s main objectives should be to shut
down Penn State running back Eric McCoo and‘ to keep
quarterback Rashard Casey contained in the pocket.
Stopping the running game will be a tough task.
Pitt’s defensive ends Ryan Smith (6—foot-4, 255 pounds)
and Bryan Knight (6—foot-2, 230 pounds) are both
undersized. They are matched up against the Nittany

‘ Lions bookends Kareem McKenzie (6—foot—7, 314

pounds) and Imani Bell (6—foot-4, 305 pounds).

If Pitt can keep Casey and McCoo quiet, and the
Pitt quarterbacks can pull through, Pitt should be able to

one touchdown, giving him 1,112 yards
in ﬁve starts and making him only the
24th freshman in NCAA history to accu-

'mu'late over 1,000 yards, and Bray was
‘ credited with a safety on Penn State’s

first possession of the game.

The game may have been defined by
what could have been, not what actually
was. Quarterback Darnell Dickerson
went deep all night, but a tenacious Lion
s/econdary kept the ball just beyond the
fingertips of the Panther receivers.

“We could have made a couple of
plays here and there if we would have
extended ourselves,” senior ﬂanker Billy
Osborn said. ‘ _

“We had a great game plan and we
worked hard all week,”said Richards.
“We Wanted to run against them and
come up with the big plays, the big pass-
es.” - .

“We were just trying to set some-

' thing up,” offered Dickerson, who

passed for 104 yards on nine completions
and ran for an additional 62 yards.

“We had a couple of chances to put it
away early. You’ve got to give the Penn
State defense credit,” Osborn added.

‘ Patemo did just( that, even though
Pitt racked up nearly 30 yards more than
Penn State usually allows, thanks largely

‘to Pitt’s 272 yards on the ground.

“I thought we played solid defense.

,We played hard against a team that is a L
fgood offensive team, particularly with

the quarterback that theyhave.”

Pitt was ranked 15th in the nation in
total offense prior to the game, averaging
450.9 yards per contest. .

Offensively, the Lions struggled.
Kicker Ray“ Tarasi missed three ﬁeld
goals, one a blocked attempt by Panther
comerback Cornell Holloway.

The Panthers blocked. two Penn

1 ~ State ﬁeld goal attempts in their 10-0 win

last year. .

The Pitt defense held the Lions to
220 ‘total yards, only 106 on the ground,
between a total of seven runners.

“I felt like our defensive_ line must
have played well,” Gottfried understated.

If playing hard can be measured in
penalties, then the two teams should both
be in the hospital today. Five personal
foul’ calls were levied and 13 total penal-

— ties were marked off for 124 lost yards.

Somewhere in between, Lions quar-

terback Lance Lonergan managed to ‘

throw three interceptions, and the Lions
fumbled the ball away once. Pitt gave the

‘ball up on fumbles twice.

“There were a lot of mistakes made

today,” Gottfried said. “Certainly there

were a lot of turnovers. We put ourselves
in the hole penalty—wise. You can’t do
that. We had. a chance to put the game
away a little earlier, and Penn State made
some great plays.”

But those plays were few and far
between. , ~ j

The Panthers opened the game with

I

1 three first downs on their first possession

but could not advance past the Penn State
41. Yusef Washington’s punt was
downed at the PSU 3—yard line.

Two plays and two yards later,
Lonergan found himself staring Bray in
the face in the end zone. Instead of taking
thesack and resultingsafety, Lonergan
chucked the ball toward the Penn State
student section, not a receiver.

Intentional grounding was called
against Lonergan, and Bray was credited
with a safety, the first two points of his
Pitt career. I

. “I went to hit him, and I couldn’t tell
whether he threw it or not. I grabbed his
legs and I wasn’t sure if they said his
knee hit. I thought he threw the ball,”
Bray said.

Pitt’s lead wasn’t threatened until
Tarasi attempted a 40-yard ﬁeld goal

with 3:36 .to play in the first quarter.

The kick went wide right, however.
Tarasi found himself on the ﬁeld three
minutes later, but his ﬁeld goal attempt
was blocked by Holloway and recovered
by Bray on the Pitt 32.

Eleven plays later, the Lions found
themselves inside the Pitt 10, thanks in
large part to a 38-yard pass completion
from Lonergan to David Daniels.

On third and goal from the 1-yard
line, Sam Gash went over the top, and
the PAT gave'Penn State its only points
of the game and a 7-2 lead with 10:15 to
play in the second quarter.

Pitt answered on its next possession,
sending Richards around left end for a 6-
yard touchdown run.

The two-point conversion attempt
failed, and Pitt led’ 8-7 with 5:11 remain-
ing in the half. . ‘

After a Penn State punt, Pitt took
over on its own 32. Dickerson -marched
the ball upﬁeld to the PSU 22, where
Richards needed only 1 yard to surpass

i the 1,000 yard mark.

The Panthers apparently caught the
Lions in that mind—set as fullback Ronald
Redmon took the ball for a 13-yard gain

' to the Penn State 9. '

On fourth and goalfrom the 1, Scott
Kaplan booted an 18-yard ﬁeld goal to
give the Panthers all the points they
would need.

But Kaplan added another three
points at 9:31 of the third quarter to pro-'
duce what would be the final score.

Penn State mounted a furious come-
back early in the fourth quarter with a 39-
yard Tarasi ﬁeld goal attempt that fell
wide left. .

. The Lions never threatened again.
