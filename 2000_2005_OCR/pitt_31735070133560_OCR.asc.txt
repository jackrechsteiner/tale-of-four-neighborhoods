men falling Onto Forbes Avenue and being struck
by a passing vehicle, according to city police

According to Bryant, an eyewitness told police
that pedestrian Wayne Brandt was standing at the
curb on Forbes Avenue near McKee Place, waiting
-to cross the street when a Pittsburgh Steelers hard
hat he was holding- struck the back of a passing car.

Daniel Clemmons, the driver or the car, pulled

‘Boondocks’ cartoonist speaks on race and terror

LAUREN KOCH/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Aaron McGruder, creator of the syndicated cartoon strip “The Boondocks,”
spoke at Pitt last night.

CHRIS GRISWOLD
For The Pitt News

“Why are you mad at the man’

who says, ‘I hate America’ and is
attacking America, but not at the
man who says ‘I love America’ and
does nothing?”

Aaron McGruder, creator of the
popular but controversial comic
strip “The Boondocks,” spoke can-
didly Tuesday about politics, terror-

ists and Hollywood.

, Shortly after taking the William
Pitt Union‘Assemb1y Room podium,
McGruder decided to skip the nor-
mal routine of speaking and instead
headed straight for the question-
and-answer session,‘ allowing the
approximately 50 people’ in the
audience to shape the course -of the
dialogue.‘  ‘

Quickly, discussion turned
toward the eventsof Sept. ll,-and
McGruder’s ruminations on the

' attacks in the strip. The question

seemed inevitable, considering the
amount of controversy the strips
stirred up, even more than his high-
ly publicized anti-George Luca
diatribes of 1999. ’
The strip "depicts the daily lives
of Huey and Riley, two black chil-
dren now living with their grandfa-
ther in a predominantly white sub-
urb. While Riley embraces “thug
life,” taking gangsta_s as role mod-
els and bullying, Huey plays the
precociously cynical political
activist, decrying the production
values of black-targeted movies and

Black Entertainment Television.

Shortly after Sept. 11, Huey
turned his attention toward the gov-
ernment, and media’s handling of
the events. In McGruder’s strip, he
called the FBI, reporting the terror-
ists’ accomplices: the government.
McGruder jokingly pre-empted his
strip for the more .Bush—friendly
“The Adventures of Flagee and
Ribbon,” whose. inanimate charac-
ters spouted patriotic slogans and
catchphrases.

The day of * the attacks,

Universal Press Syndicate canceled
‘McGruder’s looming deadline;
, “I sat and watched television for
the next five days. I called my
friends, and we were seriously‘ say-
ing, ‘OK, we’re two hours from the
Mexican border,’ hoping to escape
what mayhappen.” -

Once the Mexican border shut
down, McGruder focused on his

new deadline. Hecalled the syndi- '
cate to discuss covering the attacks". .

“ ‘‘What’s [Doonesbury’s] Gary
Trudeau doing?”
“Gary’s not touching it.”
“What? Gary’s not touching it?”
McGruder ‘said his decision to
do a satire ‘of. the Sept. 11 media
aftermath “will go a down‘ as a
defining moment,in my life.”
’,“Seeing, the direction that the

c government and media iwerfe goi’ng',”

Mcgruder '-“said-,”““Yo'u' ‘knew it was

Hostage negotiator dispells  
myths about crisis situations

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

2"

Robert Swartzwelder stood back .

to back with someone for eight
hours, and he wouldn’t talk to him.
He could ask how he was, what he
wanted, how he ‘could help him or
anything else and the answer would
be the s_ame: “Uhn.”

He was in training to be a crisis
negotiator, and it was just one of
the many patience-building exercis-
es he went through. Swartzwelder
related those and other experiences
at an invitational lecture to Lambda
Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity of the
‘American Criminal Justice
Association, on Thursday night.

“I want to dispel some myths,”
Swartzwelder said. “Not all situa-
tions can be solved by crisis negoti-
ation.” ' --

Swartzwelder also said that the
common conception of the insane
hostage—taking criminal is false as

well. Sixty percent of “subjects,” or '

suspects, in hostage situations have
no known or current mental prob-
lems, he said. ,

“That’s why it’s called crisis
negotiation; it’s people_in a crisis,”

Swartzwelder said. “That’s any of '

79

us.
Common crises include job loss,
divorce or the death of a loved one.
Swartzwelder also explained the
30-yearvhistory of ho'stage negotia-
tion. At the 1972 Olympics in

Munich, a group of Arab terrorists‘

took hostages as part of an anti-
/Israel campaign. New York, the site
/ of the next Olympics, developed a
system of negotiation in case such a
thing "should happen in 1974. After
trials, authorities discovered that
they had more than_an 80 percent
success rate when they used negoti-
ation, compared to a 40 percent
successrate-when they used force.

For 25 years, negotiation was the

standard procedure. 1
“That was they way to do it,”

\

   

www.pittnews.corn    i

It’s better than your mother’s mashed potatoes.

Swartzwelder said. “Then, on April

20, 1999, two boys walked intoga 1

school in Colorado.” C
Listeners in the small room on

\

the first floor of the William Pitt 1

Unionvwere handed around pictures

taken from the Columbine High-\

School security cameras. .

“Klebold and Harris brought it
to the front page,” Swartzwelder
said.—“Why? Because it happened in
one of our safe havens. It happened
in the suburbs. It wasn’t in the.inner
‘cities. [At schools like Columbine],
no one knows what a junkie is.”

Shaking their heads and sighing
at the picture of two" boys with
machine guns, the audience contin-
ued to listen as Swartzwelder
explainedhow the Littleton shoot-
ings changed negotiation. ‘

“We developed
response t'actics,”“ he said. “We now
send law enforcement to dangerous
situations where ‘the delay of time

increases life-threatening jeop-

Modern negotiation divides sit-

tions, whererthe subject threatens

money, asylum, etc. —‘ from- the
authorities, and “non-hostage’—’~.situ-
ations, where the victim is all that
the subject wants. A 4 _ '
In‘ those latter situations, - an
assault usually results. And the
safety of the subject is always
fourth priority, after the victim,
innocent bystanders and law
enforcement officials. [A .
“We’re paid to take risks,"
Swartzwelder said about the safety
of law enforcement officials as the
number three priority. “Calculated
risks, but we’re paid to take ‘emf,’

Tamara Lefcowitz, ‘vice-presi-
dent of LAE’s.Pitt chapter, said that

‘she’ invited Swartzwelder to speak

Poet, dreams of miniature
ponies and anti-depressants

MARTY FLAHERTY
Staff Writer

The poetry lasted only about 25 minutes
Thursday night, and began nearly 20 minutes
later than scheduled, meaning that many of the
audience members, around 60 in number,
devoted almost as much time to the compli-
mentary desserts and beverages as they did to
listening to poetry.

But when the reading began, the audience
was so silent that during the readers’ pauses,
the only audible sound was the gentle hiss of
the public address speakers. An attentive audi-
ence hardly ﬂinched as the first poet, Cynthia
Arrieu-King, read from her own impassioned
works. \

Later, the evening took a decidedly lighter
tone when poet Matthea Harvey was intro-
duced as “here and available, 10 bucks a pop.”

Harvey, the second of two readers at the

event, read selections from her published col- ' '

lection, “Pity the Bathtub Its Forced Embrace
of the Human Form,” among other works.
Many of her poems were what she called
“swing poems,” where the last word or phrase
of one line doubles as the beginning for the
next. -

Audience members laughed frequently
during many of her poems, which included a

pieceititled “The Crowds Cheered as Gloom

' Galloped Away,” apoem she said was based on
“a dream I had that antidepressants came in a,

large case with little ponies.”

Another of her poems dealt with the inter-
actions of three characters, first person, second
person _and third person, where different parts
of the poem used first, second and third person
pronouns accordingly. Listeners chuckled at
lines like, “third person thought first person
was the toilet paper trailing from her shoe.”

Harvey graduated from Harvard University
with a bachelor’s degree in English, and
earned a- master’s in poetry from the
University of Iowa Writer’s Workshop. She

currently teaches at Warren Wilson. College‘

and is the poetry editor for~American Letters
and Commentary. ,
Arrieu-King, who earned a master’s in
poetry from Pitt, read before Harvey, sharing
poems dealing largely with race relations.
In one of her poems, the narrator recalled a
person asking her if she was of Cherokee
descent and then insisting, in spite of repeated
objections, that she was. “You’re Cherokee,
you just don’t know it yet,” the segment con-
cluded, drawing laughter from the audience.
The reading, which was sponsored by Pitt
Arts and Pitt’s writing program, took place in

A State of the Union to remember

President George W. Bush will address
both houses of Congress and the nation
tonight at 9 pm.‘ for the armual State of the
Union. One might expect the speech to be*
easy both to craft and to deliver, granted
Bush’s sky-high public approval ratings.

But even Bush’s top aids are voicing

concern about the spwch. The details of two
topics — national security and the economy
— have the administration concerned.
And with good reason. The nation has eager-
ly awaited the President’s remarks since the
last time Bush addressed a joint session of
Congress after Sept. 11. And so should you.

In assessing the state of the union, Bush
will be forced to tackle a number of ques-
tions and will provide the public with a
glimpse into the direction the national lead-
ership is heading. This State of the Union
promises to be quite different from past
years, meritorious of a larger public audi-
ence and more public debate.

What will be done to stimulate the
economy? What will the administration do
to help create jobs? Will there be an increase
or extension of unemployment beneﬁts in
response to the economic downturn? What
about those who lost huge portions of their
retirements in the Enron bankruptcy? What
about Enron in general?

What else is being planned or done in
the name of national security? Does Bush
believe airports are safe yet? What else does
Bushpioposeinordertobeefup airline
security? What are Homeland Security

Director Tom Ridge and his staff up to?
Speciﬁcally, what is being done to stream-
line the numerous homeland security—related
agencies?
HowfarisBushwillingtogoinhis
quest to rid the Earth of “evildoers”? Will
Saddam be our next target? What other
nations might the United States target? To
what extent will the United States fund for-
eign nations’ efforts to remove terrorists?

‘ The nation should watch for Bush to
lend insight into his plans and goals for the
country in the coming year. Watch for him to
address not just national security and eco-
noniic issues, but also more standard topics
such as education and the environment.

_ The national signiﬁcance of what
promises to be a historic State of the Union
address should be enough to motivate most
to "tune in. But for those who are either total-
ly pained by politics or completely disinter-
ested in national affairs, The Pitt News offers
a suggestion: the State of the Union drinking
game. T <

The game may take many forms. Try
either drinking every time Bush bungles one
of his lines, or every time he squints at the
TelePrompTer.r If you’re advanced, you
might even try drinking every time he breaks
for applause, for the whole length of the
applause. And for the ultimate in college
patriotism, stimulate the economy by pur-
chasing a $7 case of anAmeiican brand beer.

Regardless, the State of the Union
promises to be a memorable one.

Because he has set a dangerous precedent where
terrorists start wars, President George W. Bush now
finds himself in an awkward position. Given what
the United States has done in Afghanistan, it will be
hard for him to convince India of an ethical ratio-
nale for restraint against Pakistan —— our new ally
— without sounding hypocritical.

According to the ground rules Bush laid out for
his “War on Terror,” the United States will make no
distinction between terrorists and countries that
harbor them. We will decide what evidence our
demands to hand over suspected terrorists requires.-
We have shown we will also, if our “fair warnings”
go unheeded, act at our own discretion and begin
bombing.

Terrorists attacked India’s Parliament on Dec.
13, leading to 14 deaths — including their own.
India’s government feels that the responsible
groups are based in Pakistan and represent a contin-
ued threat and that Pakistan has not adequately
responded to India’s demands to apprehend mem-
bers of these groups. According to the U.S. model,
the next step is to get ready for war. This is what
India is doing. ’

A similar logic may have led to Israel’s recent
bombing of Palestine in retaliation for terrorist

attacks.‘ Should the United Kingdom likewise start

bombing Ireland after the next Irish Republican
Army attack in London?

How are the positions of Israel, India, and the
United Kingdom different from America’s? Why

ignore international protocols because we can? Or
worse yet, do we consider America above the rest of
the world and American lives more valuable than
other lives?

People in other countries —.— and here as well — ,

in. When my white friends surround
me, my caramel-toned skin surely
sticks out, not indicating a person of
Dutch descent. I also find myself sub-
consciously reinforcing my black per-
sona, stepping up the tendency to dis-
play the certain “ghetto” traits as to
silently proclaim my “blackness” and
not be seen as an “Uncle Tom” or a
token minority;

With my black friends, I stand in
my curve-hugging jeans and my but-
ter-colored Timberlands, silently try-
ing to decipher the slang terminology
and decide to not acknowledge my
affinity for Neil Diamond by singing
his songs as a commercial for his CD
appears on TV. This spectacle would
doubtless fill the room with laughter,
puzzled looks and prompt taunts. I can
deal with the one-on-one teasing, like
from Sabina, but when the jokes come
in a collective cluster, it has the sting
of a lynch mob. So I hide myself.

Soon after Tiger Woods became
the first minority person to win the
Masters in 1997, he said on Oprah that
he considered himself “cablinasian,”
enraging the black community. But I
think almost every American can be
found to be a “cablinasian” like Tiger
or a “dublananish” like me.

From the darkest. “black pride

brotha” to the most anemic white Wall ,

Street broker, there’s a mixed ancestor
somewhere down the history line.
Most likely somebody’s slave—owning
great grandfather snuck down to the
slave quarters of somebody’s great
grandmother —— the split family tree

started from there. And if you are still’

a disbelieverfask Thomas Jefferson’s
family —— both colors. .

Too melanin enriched to even
think of blending in with whites. Not
able V to fully fit in with blacks. It
would take a drastic change of locale
to begin to fully understand my Native
roots.

In the latest issue of the Black
Action Society’s magazine Blackline,
Nicole Hillman also discusses what
it’s like to be mixed and standing at a
medium between her two cultures, like
a “little bit of gray between the dis-
tinct black’ and white areas.” But she
does not stand alone. According to the
2000 census,. 2.12 percent of
Americans ﬁlled in the “two or more
races” bubble.

So what direction do I go?

Nowhere. ~

I stand exactly where I am an

MATT FRANKLIN/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

Sophomore Jacob Lininger recorded his 17th career pin during Pitt’s meet at

Virginia Tech. He is eighth all-time-gin pins at Pitt.

JASON BARRANTI O
The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestling team fought
back from a 12-9 deficit midway
through itsmeet Saturday and main-
tained its No. 21 ranking.

For the second time this season,
Pitt knocked off rival Virginia Tech
as the Panthers came ‘away from
Blacksburg, Va. with a come—from—
behind win.

Pittsburgh started the meet with
a heavyweight victory from Jacob
Lininger. Lininger pinned Tech’S
Pete Pool at 2 minutes and 50 sec-
onds to give the Panthers a 6-0 lead.

For Lininger, a sophomore, the
fall came early in the match, much

. like his previous 10 pins this season.

Lininger’s latest blowout gave him
his 29th victory overall.

Lininger, who has 17 career pins,
now ranks eighth among the
Panthers all-time and he still has
time to improve upon his mark as the
team has four more meets remaining,
plus the Eastern Wrestling
Championship ‘ League
Championships and the NCAAS.

But the 6-0 lead would not hold

James Thornton at 125 pounds
was the first Pitt grappler to lose a
match, going down to Geoff Head by
an 8-4 decision.

Shawn Amistade failed to turn
things around as he followed
Thornton’s loss with a loss of of his
own at 133 pounds. Amistade was
defeated by No. 19—ranked David
Hoffman. Tech then took a six—point
lead in the 14l—pound bout, when
No. 2—ranked Sean Gray pinned
Blaise Mucci in 3:49.

Though he lost, Mucci’s fight
against Gray saved his team two
points. .

“By not allowing Gray to get
him on his back, Blaise helped a
lot,” said Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemeyer. “He can wrestle much,
much better, but he got too aggres-
sive and out of control.”

. Nevertheless, the Panthers
quickly turned things around after
the three losses. Justin Giovinco, at
149 pounds, recorded a 6-5 decision
over Reed Carpenter.

Zach Doll followed Giovinco’s
effort with a major decision over
Mike Cox at 157 pounds, shutting
him out 8-0. Doll’s trouncing over

Pitt speedsters excel at Penn State National Open

There’s nothing like a trip to State College.

Well, at least not for the Panther track team.

Runners and throwers have gotten some of
their best marks at Penn State’s outstanding track

, facility the past few years, and this week, one run-
, ner got a provisional qualification for the national

championship meet and some others took home
some victories, during Penn State’s National Open.

Beth Rocks got her second qualification in two
weeks in the 800«with a time of 2 minutes, 7.45
seconds, improving on her time of 2:08.12 from
last week. Rocks took third in the race.

. “T hat’s where Beth ran her best time last year,”
head coach Steve Lewis said of the Penn State
track. 1

“We had great performances all around,” he
said.

Janine Jones just missed out on a provisional
markplacing seventh (2109.89). Elizabeth Bayne
placed eighth (2/‘:12.35). '

Amanda Walker took fourth in the shot put,

with atoss of 14.68 meters, not quite a provisional 4.

J

mark but still one of the best throws in school his-
tory. R
“She had a good throw,” Lewis said, “an inch
off the school record. And that’s one of the oldest
records in the books.” ,

Patrick Harding bested the competition again
in the men’s «shot, beating his nearest opponent by
almost a full foot. Harding won with a throw of
16.48 meters. ,

“He’s nowhere near peaking,” Lewis said of

" Harding, the defending B-ig East indoor champion

in the shot. _
. Mike Stellefson placed eighth (15.08).

The women’s mile relay got a win over Big
East rival Georgetown and the rest of the field,
with a time of_3:42.93, inching closer‘ to a qualifi-
cation. The women’s relay made it to the national
meet last year. 4 .

Jones, Bayne and Lamoy Stephens joined Mera
Belisle on the relay. Belisle also finished third in
the individual 400 race (56.63), an event in which
she was Eastern’ Collegiate Athletic Conference
champion last indoor season. Stephens finished
sixth (57.18).

“Stephens is a freshman we’re really excited

about,” Lewis said. “She did a great job.”

On the men’s side, the team of Anthony
Pelham, Ryan Smith, Jesse Chalfant and Jeryl
Wilborn placed fifth (3216.39). Pelham took fifth
in the 400 for the men (48.61). _

Lewis has been giving Wilborn time to concen-
trate on the men’s 800, and he has been making

7 good use of it. He took third, with a time of

1:51.42, a little _over a second from a provisional.
Chalfant, a provisional qualifier in the event last
year, placed eighth (1:52.77).

Kim Lyles pulled double duty in the 60 dash
and the 200 again, and she finished both with good
results. Lyles took third in the 200 with a time of
24.27. A couple tenths of a second less, and she’ll
qualify for nationals. Lyles also finished tied for
fourth in the dash (7.62).

Maurice Patterson finished eighth in the men’s
dash (7.01).

“The whole team performed better than last
week,” Lewis said. 3

Now the Panthers move from one rival school
to another, heading to ‘Morgantown this weekend

I for the WVU Adidas Classic, where Lewis said the

focus is to “regroup and have some fun.”

Parents showing ability as worst sports of all

All right ladies and gentlemen,

let’s strap on our hard hats
and safety goggles and
jump into the time machine.
Remember when you ‘
were a youngchild playing
in that Little League or soc-
cer or Pop Warner games?

that always sat in the back
of the stands, screaming at
the coaches, referees or hot
dog vendors? ‘
Everyone always felt

Spears VIEW

Joe Marchilena

It was the parents sitting behind

me that I could have done
without.

While watching a soft-
ball game that would
eventually send Mi1ford’s
12- and 13-year old team
to the national tourna-
ment, I could overhear one
mother whisper to another
that she was so nervous
about the game that she
had not slept in three days.

Are you kidding me?
Did this woman expect to

mom that was. It must have been tough be called in to close the game? Was she
listening to your parent’s obnoxious the power hitter waiting to pinch—hit,

voice come roaring over from the side-
lines.

Those crazy parents used‘to say .

the damedest things, didn’t they?

It never amounted to anything,
though. Sure, Dad may have said he
was going to find the umpire after the
game and show him what a strike real-
ly looks like.

But nothing ever happened. That
would have been really crazy, right?

Just ask Thomas Junta how crazy
parents can get. ‘

Unfortunately, because ‘ of Junta,-
Michael Costin will never get to watch
his son play hockey again.

On July 5, 2000, Junta became

upset when he felt that the play on the
ice of a practice session that Costin .

was running in Cambridge, Mass. got
too physical. Junta confronted Costin
on the ice and after the two exchanged
words, Junta, who outweighed Costin
by about a hundred pounds, attacked
the smaller man. , ‘ '

\~ ,Witnesses said that Junta knocked
Costin down and continued to beat him
senseless on the ice. Medical examin-
ers would later determine that Costin

suffered severe brain damage before he

died. ‘ ‘

All this took place in front of
Costin’s four children and Junta’s son.
Junta’ was sentenced on_ Jan. 25 to six
to 10 years after being convicted of
involuntary manslaughter earlier this
month.

Adults are supposed to be th 

rational ones, the ones who calm the
kids down when they get upset, about a
bad call or a coach’s decision.

They are supposed to be the ones
who tell their children that it’s only a
game. At least that’s what my parents

always did.

That doesn’t always happen.

I had the opportunity recently to
watch a couple of youth sporting
events in my home state of New
Hampshire, and I must say that the
«competition on the ﬁeld of play was

How could something like this

      
 

sitting on the bench because she could-
n’t play the ﬁeld? ,

Crazy parent sighting number two
occurred at a basketball game that
needed overtime to decide the out-
come.

The game was even longer after
one of the high school players was
knocked upside-down and landed on
his neck. The entire gymnasium was
‘silent for close to 20 minutes while the
paramedics raced to the school to cart
the young teen to the hospital.

Well, everyone was quiet except
for the woman sitting behind me. After
screaming at her son’s team for more
than 90 minutes, this woman was

 

.. Live. in all catty

thoughtless enough to let everyone in
the near vicinity know that the kid’s
parents should just pick him up off the
ﬂoor so the teams could finish the
game.

Whatever happened to parents
teaching their children good sports-
manship?

Apparently it has been locked
away in the closet along with that old,
blue shirt my dad just won’t give away.

Joe Marchilena is a columnist for the
Pitt News and he would like his dad to
know that he does not have a problem
with the shirt; it must just be Mom that

Stiff schedule set for

2002 Pitt football    

Kama ATPIJPAULC
Sports Editor
. After. ﬁnishing the season with six
consecutive wins, its best‘ ﬁnish in 18

V ' years, including a 34-19 victory over

North Carolina State in the Tangerine
Bowl, Pitt must look forward to a strong
2002 schedule.

Next season’s schedule includes 12,

regular-season games, including seven

a home games at Heinz’ Field. ’

Seven of the teams on the slate had
Winning records last season,_ with six
teams making a bowl game. '

 ,_ Among the teams visiting Heinz
Field" are Big 12 power Texas A&M,
Boston College and_ Toledo. All three
teams were victorious in postseason play
last season.‘ Also, the tradition of the

g Backyard Brawl continues as’ West

 makes: the short_,tn'p to ‘Heinz
Field for the season _f1_nale. - V’
 --Pitt’s meeting‘ with Texas A&M-,

_ -which takes place ‘on’-Sept. 7-, is a
_ rematch of the 1989 John Hancock Bowl

that saw'Pitt win 31-28. The Aggies
defeated Texas Christian in . the

Ga1leryfurniture.com Bowl ‘last season,

28-9.  

9 Boston College enjoyed a 20-16 Vic.-
tory over Georgia in the 2001 Music
City Bowl, while “Toledo beat
Cinncinnati, 23-16, in the Motor City
Bowl.‘ _ , ‘

V The road schedule will present some
major challenges for the ball club, none
more so than the team’s Nov. 21 meeting
at Miami, the reigning national champi-
ons. Pitt will also visit Syracuse, Virginia

Tech and a second consecutive trip at ’

Notre Dame. , ,

The Panthers are scheduled to make
at least two national television appear-
ances. Pitt. will make its return to
ESPN ’s Thursday night football for a
record ninth time, when -it heads to
Miami, inthe Orange Bowl. The game at
Notre Dame will appear on NBC.

The combined 2001 records of Pitt’s
future foes is 76-62, but that statistic
takes into account Rutgers’, Temp1e’s,

Ohio’s and West V1rginia’s records, who '

were a dismal 10-34 overall. :

Additional television dates and start-
’ times will be armounced at a later date.

Fronhofer, Sandberg stay hot on mats

I Pinned, page 11

Cox gave the Panthers a one-point
edge overall; they wouldn’t lose the
lead again.

No. 17-ranked Carl Fronhofer
recorded another Pitt victory in 6:46,
with a pinfall over Shaun Guttridge.

“Carl solidified the meet for us,”
Stottlemeyer said.

The _ 165-pound Fronhofer
increased his record to a dominating
20-4 with his win. Matt Catullo fol-
lowed with a major decision over
Tomas Ovalle in the 174-pound
bout, winning by the same 16-5 mar-

gin as in their first match.

“Matt was able to control his
opponent and that was big,”
Stottlemeyer said.

The Panthers commanded an 11-
point lead over Virginia Tech after
Catullo’s win.

Scott Justus of Virginia Tech
proved to be the only pest during the
Panthers’ late surge.

No. 3—ranked Justus recorded his
20th victory and is undefeated this
season. Justus recorded a 24-9 major
decision over Pitt’s Rob Black, who
has struggled as of late for the
Panthers.

Though Virginia Tech earned
four points and closed the gap to a

seven—point margin — it proved to 1

be too little too late. ,

Pitt’s No. 19-ranked David
Sandberg finished out the meet with
a decision over Canaan Prater. The
197-pound Prater fell to Sandberg 2-
1 in the decision.

The Panthers 10-point comeback
win over Virginia Tech improves
their record to 11-3, and they are
now 3-0 against teams in the EWL.
Pitt returns to action Feb. 8, when it

takes on No. 11-ranked Lock Haven .
