One of America is greatest student newspapers —- since 1906

VOLUME XCVHI, NUMBER 109

MICHELLE SCOTT .
Senior Staff Writer

A Penn State senior said that
she was sexually harassed while
beingichecked by a security guard
on her way into Heinz Field at the
at Pitt vs. Miami game on Nov. 29.

The Penn State student, Lucy,
who asked that her actual name not
be used, explained that she ‘and her
friends arrived at Heinz Field about
five minutes into the game’s first
quarter. ‘By that time, she said, it
was dark, and there wasn’t anyone
around. She added that each of her
friends went to different guards and
that she was one of the last people
to pass through the gates. ‘

“As I put my arms up to be
checked,-the guard checking meran
his hands up the front of my body
and , over my breasts,” »Lucy
explained in an e-mail. “In doing
so, he said ‘Oh, yeah, baby. That’s
real nice.’ He then ran his hand
back down my body and gave my’

‘waist a squeeze when he was fin-

ished. He then told me to ‘have a
nice night.’ I was so. shocked that
this was happening that I couldn’t
even say anything to him.”

Lucy said that this was the first
time she had ever been checked by
security at a game, explaining that.
guards don’t conduct body searches
at Penn State’s Beaver Stadium’.
She, said that she wouldn’t have
been able toaidentify the guard after
she had walked away and. thus did
not report the incident while she
was at the game.

She did write to Jim Earle,’

Pitt’s associate athletic director for
New Business and Fan
Development, as well as ‘several

other members of Pitt’s athletics.

staff, on Dec. 1, 2003. She said that
Earle responded about two or_three

 

  Student allegedly
harassed at game

days later, assuring her inian e-mail

that he would address the incident

with Heinz Field staff immediately.

“This is,’ the first harassment
complaint I have hea‘rd,of in the 10
years I have worked here,” Earle
said. He explained that Pitt’s athlet-
ics department informed its contact
at Heinz:F-ield of the incident and
that it would be addressed at the
season wrap—up meeting between

/Pitt athletics and Heinz Field staff

sometime in the next month.

Earle said that the guards are
part of a-“private security company
employed by Heinz Field, and,
therefore, are not Pitt employees.

This same security company works. a

at the Petersen Events Center,
though the guards there check
patrons differently. He explained
that guards at Petersen ask patrons

to unzip their coat and check the"
coat itself rather than checking it on

the person’s body, so as to ‘prevent
situations similar to Lucy’s.

“We can’t dictate thepolicy at

Heinz Field, but whenwe review
the season with [Heinz Field staff,]
We will stress this as a better way to
check for security,” Earle said,
referring to the coat removal sys-
tem.

“This is definitely something
we don’t .want for the University,
for the patron, or for" us,”a said
Jimmie Sacco, executive director
for stadium management at the

Local restaurants start buying into the Atkins diet

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

For more than 53 years, F.
Tambellini Ristorante on Seventh
Street has provided the people of
Pittsburgh with Italian dishes,
including pastas, parmigianas and
marsalas.

Recently, though, Tambellini
started to offer a weekly low-carbo-
hydrate buffet featuring meat
entrees, domestic and imported
cheeses, fresh salad greens, Atkins-
approved vegetables and specialty

«dishes such as pasta-less lasagnas

and seafood frittatas —— all created
as an alternative to its high-carbo-
hydrate menu of pastas and fried
foods.

“We’ve seen the trend,” said
Tambellini owner Charles
Pellegrini. “People were going low-
carb, and we even heard about it in
the news.”

The trend springs from the
increasing popularity of the Atkins
diet and other low-carbohydrate
diets, which are beginning to affect
businesses — such as Italian restau-
rants, bakeries and pastry shops -
that rely on high-carbohydrate
foods for success.

Originally detailed in a book
published in 1972, the Atkins diet
emphasizes replacing foods that are
high in carbohydrates with high-
protein and fatty products.

The theory E is that eating
reduced amounts of carbohydrates
forces the body to burn fat and shed
weight. V -

If dieters stick to specific types
of food, mostly meat, eggs and
dairy products, they can eat as
much as desired and still continue
to burn fat, according to Atkins.

According to Atkins
Nutritionals Inc., about 25 million
Americans are on the Atkins diet,

while nearly 100 million are fol-
lowing some form of reduced-car-
bohydrate diet.

Tony Benjamin, an operations
manager at UNICCO in Ohio,
offered his story as evidence of the
diet’s effectiveness and an example
of why it’s becoming so popular.

“I lost 180 pounds three years
ago, and I’Ve since put 60 of it back
on,” Benjamin said.

“I went no carbs. It took eight
months to lose 180 pounds. [Before
the diet,] I was borderline diabetic,
and then my blood sugar was per-
fect —— and my blood pressure was
perfect at the end of the diet. It’s
kind of addictive.”

Benjamin and the’ millions of
other people on the Atkins diet are
the driving force behind the shift
that has occurred in the American
appetite, which has‘ moved from
high-carbohydrate foods, like
breads, pastries and pastas, to low-
carbohydrate products, such as
eggs, cheeses and meats. .

Last month, Tyson Foods, one
of the world’s largest manufacturers
of meat products, announced a 75
percent increase in its fourth—quar-
ter income — probably in some way
a result of the high-protein regi-
mens prescribed by the Atkins diet.

Like Tambellini, other owners
of Pittsburgh—area high-carbohy-
drate businesses have taken steps, to
survive in a low-carbohydrate
world.

“Most bakeries are reactive, and
they try to promote the old-fash-
ioned food pyramid,” said Nick
Mancini Hartner, a baker at Mancini
Bread by McKees Rocks Bread
Company in the Strip District.

“They try to throw the old stuff
at [the customers], and people
aren’t reacting to it. That’s been the
bakery trend for the last three
years.” I

»1y.n .

According to the National Bread
Leadership Council, 40 percent of
Americans are eating less ‘bread
than they did a year ago. Of that 40
percent, 63 percent say they are eat-
ing less to control their daily carbo-
hydrate consumption.

“Itcame to the point where you
start to see the numbers actually in
your sales,” Hartner said. “-So at
that point, we decided to finally be
proactive about [the trend] and get a
product out that is low-carb, and
give the customer what he wants,
instead of trying to tell the cus-
tomers what they want.”

Mancini produces two types of

low-carbohydrate breads to" meet»

the demands of its customers. The
first is an ultra-low-carbohydrate
Italian bread with four grams of
carbohydrates per slice — one-
fourth the number of carbohydrates
in Mancini’s regular Italian bread.

The second is a reduced-carbo-
hydrate, multi—grain bread with
eight grams of carbohydrates per
slice. E,

To make each style of bread,
Mancini substitutes therecipe-pre-
scribed ﬂour, which is 95 percent
carbohydrates, with destarched
Wheat, a high-protein by—product
created in the production of flour.

The result, when prepared and
baked conventionally, is a low-car-
bohydrate, 'low—fat, high-protein
bread that Hartner said has been
extremely successful.

“It’s very popular,” Hartner
said. “We sell out every day, usual-

Other bakeries and pastry shops
in Pittsburgh have noticed the low-
carbohydrate trends induced by the
Atkins diet, but they have not made
any changes to their menu as a
result. .

In fact, according to Dave
Brown, owner of Craig Street

Coffee and Deli in Oakland, the.

impact ofithe diet on his business
has been mostly a change in the
popularity of his offerings.

“We’ve probably sold more
chicken salads‘, tuna salads, and
once in a while we’ll have people
come in and ask for a grilled chick-
en sandwich without the bread,”
Brown said. “Last year atthis time,
we weren’t selling hardly any
grilled chicken salads, and [now]
we sell a dozen or two a day in the
middle of winter.”

“We’ve never done that before,”
he added, “so that’s an item on the ,

menu that’s selling verkywwell, prob-
ably because of the Atvlcilrisidiet-.”

According to Larry ‘Lagattuta,
owner of Enrico’s Biscptti in the
Strip District, he has noticed no
decrease in his sales as a result of
the increasing popularity of the
Atkins diet.

Lagattuta said he has no future
plans to offer any low-carbohydrate
alternatives to his customers. 9

“We only use real stuff:’ real
butter, real‘ eggs, real’ flour,"real‘

-sugar,” Lagattuta said: “I don’t like ’

the way that stuff [low-carbohy-
drate ingredients] tastes, and.we’re

_ trying to be as authentic as we can.”

Lagattuta attributes the success
of his business to the willingness of
people to indulge in buying his bis-
cotti.’ 

I He says that while there are
plenty of people onthe Atkins diet,‘

. there are ‘millions more not on the

diet.

- I-“There is some ' percentage ‘of
people [who] are on the Atkins diet,
but, gosh, there is certainly a whole
large percentage who comes in here
and says, ‘I can’t have this ../. give
me six of them,”’ Lagattuta said.
“I’m a carbohydrate ‘pimp. You
smell the smells and see the stuff
and I say, ‘Come on!”’

Peer—to—peer sexual harassment common form for undergrads

MICHELLE SCOTT
Senior Staff Writer

Sexual harassment doesn’t just happen at the
office. It can happen in the classroom, the cafeteria
or even a sports complex.

- “You never assume anything like that is going to
happen to you, so when it happens, you justkind of
shut down,” said Lucy, a Penn State student who
asked that her actual name not be used. Lucy said
that a guard at Heinz Field sexually harassed her
when she attended a Pitt football game last fall.

But although sexual harassment can happen just

about everywhere, you don’t have to take it any-'

where.

“Sexual harassment is unwelcome _and it’s sexu-
al in nature,” said Elaine Frampton, associate direc-

tor for Pitt’s Office of Affirmative Action. This def-=

inition covers a broad range of cases. « .
According to Pitt’s official definition, sexual
harassment can occur when there is a power’ differ-
ential between the people involved, or when they
have the same status. It can occur‘ between people of

different genders, or people of the same gender. For _

instance, in 2002 the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission received
14,396 complaints about sexual harassment, 14.9
percent of which were ﬁled by men. It can occur on

University premises or off campus at University-

sponsored events, as was the case when Lucy visit-

ed Heinz Field. _ _

Sexual harassment can fall into two categories,
said  Koch Ruiz, coordinator of Pitt’s Sexual
Assault Services. According to Pitt’s definition, one
form occurs when conduct of a sexual nature unrea-
sonably interferes with an individual’s work or aca-
demic performance, or creates an intimidating, hos-
tile 'or offensive ‘work environment.

Pitt’s deﬁnition also states that unwanted sexu-
al advances, requests for sexual favors, and other

verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature qua1i- ‘

fy as. sexual harassment when submission to such

- conduct_ becomes a, condition of employment or ac-a-_

This also includes instances when
the acceptance or rejection of such
conduct becomes the basis for an aca-
demic or employment decision. Ruiz
explained that this form of harassment
is known as “quid

is treating a certain student different-

“The [sexual harassment] cases
that are more serious start as consen-

common type of
sexual harass-
ment is peer
harassment,”
Koch Ruiz said, addingthat the most
common form of peer harassment was
group harassment.- For example, she

‘explained that when she was an under-

grad, a group of men would call out
ratings on" a scale from one to 10 as_
she and her friends walked past their
table in the cafeteria. . -
“What was interesting was that no
one defined that as sexual harassment
at that time,” Ruiz said, “but it was so

, intimidating to be rated as you walked

by that particular table.” _
Consensual’ relationships between
faculty and students can also become
related to sexual harassment. Pitt’s
policy on consensual relationships
prohibits intimate relationships
between a faculty member and a stu-
dent whose research, academic work

,or teaching is being evaluated or

supervised by that faculty member.

Frampton explained that when
these consensual -relationships do
develop, the student is supposed to
remove himself or herself from the
class or, in some cases, to get a new
adviser. ‘ ‘ V A ’ '

“If either side is not having a’
problem, then we don’t‘ interfere with
personal relationships,” Frampton
said. She explained that, in many
cases, complaints about consensual

relationships come from third parties,

Consequences of refusing a drug test

It’s dangerous to appear stoned
in junior high school these days.

A staff member at North -Hills
Junior High who suspected a stu-
dent there of using drugs sent the
kid to the school nurse.

After the student was asked and
refused to take a drug test, the
school contacted the student’s par-
ents, who stood by their child’s_
decision. .

Under the current disciplinary
code, without proof that the student
was actually on drugs, the ‘school
couldn’t pursue any action more
severe than a warning.

But superintendent John_ D.

Esaias wants a student’s refusallto I

take a drug test to have the same
consequences as flunking one —
immediate suspension followed by
an “alternative education program.”

If the student refuses to attend
bad—kid school, the board sets up an
expulsion hearing.

So, the precedent being set here
is simple: if a kid looks like he
might be smoking the dope, he’s
guilty until proven innocent. A

Do these administrators remem-
ber what it was like in junior high?

The intoxicating brew of hor-
mones coursing through everyone’s
bodies coupled with the stultifying
— to junior high kids, atleast —
content of the classes can ‘make just

about anyone seem a little loopy.
So, if a single teacher thinks

that Mary Jane was acting a little

strange during social studies, she’ll

be called upon to prove that she’s.

not on drugs, or accept the conse-
quences of actually being on drugs.

Teachers are often thefirst line
of defense against youngsters’

developing drug. problems, and that
fact shouldn’t be denied. ’

However, there are those teach-
ers whojmightanot likea particular
student or his choice‘ of dreadlocks
and Grateful Dead T-shirts.

That teacher could be granted
tremendous and arbitrary power
over the kid’. 7 " , _

If the school district wants to
take steps to curb student drug use,
they must come up with a fair and
codified protocol for forcing the
student to decidebetween a drug
test or bad—kid school or worse.

For instance, if three teachers
independently refer a student to the
nurse for a drug test, then perhaps
calling the student in for testing is
appropriate. ,

Assuming this guilty-until-
proven—innocent measure is passed,
it is incumbent upon the school dis-
trict to notify kids of the terrible
consequences of trying to makea
stand in defense of their own priva-

cy.

Beware the grasping ambition of llamas A

As a paranoid, white, Jewish

existence of mankind.

In our fast-paced
society of “Inter—net,”

grown neglectful "of the
more than immediate
threat of takeover posed
by other species. ,. -'

Of course they understand how

They have huge, shiny eyes,

Making a connection with a good man who’s gone

I was at my aunt’s house on a
recent trip home when I unwittingly
made an unnerving discovery: a jour-
nal kept by my uncle, who had been
dead for more than twelve years. On a
drive home from where he taught
music at a high school in Morgantown,
W. Va., my uncle had pulled over to
offer a ride to a hitchhiker, an example
of the random kindness that seemed to
characterize my uncle’s days, accord-
ing to all family accounts. In this
instance, his selﬂessness was met with
a gunshot, and my uncle was left for
dead alongside a lonely country road,
his car and money stolen. Amazingly,
he was able to crawl several miles to
the first house in sight and was imme-
diately rushed to the hospital.

The next year was a trying one for
the family, to put it mildly, as my uncle
was kept on dialysis and cared for by
my aunt while she simultaneously
watched over her elderly mother and
teenaged children. My uncle was able
to return home from the hospital even-
tually, but was forced to undergo treat-
ment each day. He was also extremely
limited in his actions, as the shooting
had left him virtually paralyzed.
Despite his incessant treatment, my
uncle passed away after several
months. »

This has all been told to me, of
course, my only memories of my uncle

being vague ones. Because of my age,
my family decided ‘against
explaining what exactly
happened; my uncle just
seemed to have suddenly
gotten very sick.

I knew as soon as I
found the journal, I wanted
to read it. I was hesitant to
ask my aunt, not wanting to
appear morbid or intrusive,
but she didn’t seem offend-
ed when I finally asked‘.
The reason became appar— '
ent when, on one of the ,
first pages, my uncle established his
primary motivation for writing as
being able to give his children and
“hopefully grandchildren” (he now has
two, too young to read) a better per-
ception of who he was in the months
following the accident. While I didn’t
exactly fit into either of these cate-
gories, I now felt sufficiently guilt-
free to continue reading.

The fact that he chose to use the
word “accident” when describing what
had happened to him is very telling
about my uncle, a man who didn’t
think of himself as unfairly victimized
or punished by a cruel world. To my
uncle, his misfortune was merely an
accident in the plan he had outlined for
his life — no reason to ‘remain bitter.
This was the last direct reference to

    

Daron Chritopher

Columnist

the shooting in the journal. No damna-
tion of the culprit or pon-
dering of injustice. Given
that the journal was intend-
ed to be read by future
generations, . it’s under-
standable for a positive
outlook to be emphasized.
I’m certain that my uncle
had to have had some
sleepless nights of ponder-
ing such questions. He still
maintained a facade of
strength, the bulk of his
entries circling upon the
mundane aspects of everyday family
life, every entry ending with “Best
Wishes.” I don’t mean to suggest that
my uncle hid his true feelings --
rather, he found solace in focusing on
the things he loved in his life that he
stillhad, the pages filled with pride

when his son passed his drivers’ exam, ‘

anxiety when his daughter called from
summer camp homesick, affection for
his ever-loyal wife. The fact that I’m
only mentioned in passing once, in the
guise of the unruly 6-year-old I was,
makes me feel robbed of ever getting
the chance to know him. Of course,
“robbed” is not a. word my uncle
would have chosen to use. This is but
one way I wish to emulate him.

Years of being weaned on “carpe
diem” and “make each moment count”

have forced me to put far too much
emphasis on my current state, and
keep me constantly worried that I’m
missing out because I’m not doing
something more productive — or more
fun. Whenever I get the feeling that I
am wasting my gift of life, I now try to
think of my uncle, who, in the face of
imminent death, harbored hope for the
future —— my heart ‘ached during an
entry about attending his high school
reunion when he said he was looking
forward to attending the next event in
2001 — while remaining content and
happy in some of the most unfair cir-
cumstances imaginable. Confined to a
wheelchair, my uncle was happy to
have a View of his garden. "Surely, I
can weather the storms of bad grades
and petty heartache if my uncle could

smile through such canyons of poten- ’

tial misery.

My uncle’s spirit brought out the
best in a family that came together to
care for him — and _ to protect- me.
Another humble journal entry con-
tained the entry, “I believe people are
basically good,” a sentiment my uncle
not only believed, but proved. As
Albert Camus might have said, in the
depths of his winter, I learned there
was in him an invincible summer.

Ranch — it’s the only safe way

Wein, page 6

group of semi-drunk college students found
that llamas do not like Doritos. 4

They don’t hate Doritos, they simply
won’t eat them.

That said, our first safety precaution
should be to make as many things as possible
out of Doritos so that we might begin to
llama—proof our society.

It’s imperative to_ start with everyday
items such as shoes, pens and compact discs
before even so much as attempting full scale
replications of buildings like the Cathedral of
Learning or the Statue of Liberty.

The researchers also discovered in llamas
a passionate disdain for David Bowie’s newer
work —— specifically, tracks off of Hours and
Heathen. V

When said music was played, the llamas,
which had been grazing in close proximity to
the researchers’ car, all trotted in terror to the
opposite corner of their enclosure.

Apparently, llamas gave up on Bowie
after “China Doll,” but you can hardly fault
them for that.

The threat these beasts pose to our way of

life is not to be taken lightly. Roughly 4,000
years of domestication would make anyone
bitter enough to plot against his or her oppres-
sors, and that’s just what the llamas may be up
to right now.

People from all walks of life are certainly

capable of joining hands to fight back the‘

impending llama invasion. ,

Here in America, Congress could llama-
proof the country_with two easy amendments
to the USA'PATRIOT .Act, mandating that
every citizen own copies of Outside and
Reality, and that the only legal ﬂavors of any-
thing be Nacho Cheesier and Cooler Ranch.

With just a few easy adjustments, we
should be able to enjoy our day—to-day lives
without the ever—present threat of llama
takeover.

At this point, you must. ask yourself if it’s
really worth the effort. After all, you simply
can’t forget: these multi-billion dollar precau-

tions may save society, but llamas are so

damn cute.

llamas and welcomes both their rule and your ‘

According to “Donnie Darko,” schol-
ars once said that the words “cellar door’
were the most perfect pair of words in the
English language. John Vanderslice’s new
record, Cellar Door, doesn’t quite reach
that magniﬁcent peak, but it’s still a pretty
solid record. V

The clumsy rhythm of the opening
track, “Pale Horse,” kicks off the disc with
a‘g'alloping feel. Throughout the CD, you’ll
ﬁnd the usual guitars, drums, bass and
vocals, but you’ll also hear keyboards and
electronic drums. Vanderslice really sets
himself apart from other singers and song-

writers with his unique work. The songs
have delightful hooks, and he really varies
the tempo and styles, writing ambient
pieces such as “Wild Strawberries,” com-
plete with reverse samples and distin-
guished by his sullen voice. He then switch-
es to acoustic folk with songs like “My
Family Tree,” only to changeto a delight-
fully poppy sound in “They Won’t Let Me
Run.” And the best part is that he doesn’t
seem like he’s forcing these styles; rather,
he lets them ﬂow naturally without wearing
himself too thin. -

The fact that Vanderslice toured with
other well-known bands, such as Sunny
Day Real Estate, The Mountain Goats,
Pedro the Lion, should let most know that
he could be a household name at any point,
at least as far as the indie and emo scene are
concerned. Formerly in the experimental
indie-pop band MK Ultra — which, despite
the fact that rm well-versed in the armals of
indie music, even I am not familiar with —

And the solo
route seems to be
suited to him, as
this‘ record is
pretty danm
good. As men-
tioned previous- '
ly, Vanderslice worked plenty of variation
into this album, allowing for the irnagina-_
tion to wander while actively listening to
this album. It’s mellow enough to play as

 

background music, yet adventurous enough -

to actively listen to. At times, his voice even
hits sounds reminiscent of Ben Gibbard of
Death Cab for Cutie and (the artists forrner—

Delightfully poppy, but bittersweet

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2004,

enough in lyrical content to avoid coming
off as a contrived record, Cellar Door does
what it can to stand out from the pack. As
long as Vanderslice keeps his material var-
ied, he should ﬁnd plenty of success with-
out being pigeonholed and written off as yet
another indie-pop nobody. This is a good
record to put on for these cold February
nights, for sure. ’ A T

There was a time when televi-
sion sitcoms and dramas focused on
plot, setting and character develop-
ment. Then companies observed the
power of synergy. Shows like “The

Real World” started featuring blatant’

advertisements from companies like
Pepsi and Sony, and the whole
advertisement world was shot into a
tailspin. What does this have to do
with eastmountainsouth‘? '

For starters, EMS is a folky, and
sometimes country, adult contempo-
rary band that would fit in perfectly
on soft rock radio stations _.around
the country. Not too shabby, but
unfortunately,’ it feels like it belongs
on weeknight drama shows like
“Smallville” and “One Tree Hill.”
Oh, wait.

The band has been featured on

P vocal ' harmonies

shows such as these, furthering the
trend of combining tele—visual enter-
tainment while marketing the “next
big band.” What S
EMS does, it -
does very well:

over folk rock
son-gs on an
album. that runs
close to an hour.
But at the end of
the hour, you
won’t feel ful-
filled. Just like a
good book needs
a plot, EMS
needs some sort
of conflict and
resolution for it
to be more than a
mediocre album.

Tracks like
.“Too Soon” more
or less give you
the feel of the
record. Its-slow-
to-mid—tempo jams play out perfect-
ly for weeknight drama ‘shows, with
a feel that the band was originally

writing music for television. Their
songs seem like they would fit- the
ending credits of a show or as back-

ground music. during conversation.
The overall somber tonealmost
lays itself out like the introductions

of songs by boring artists such as
Nickelback and Creed, but at least
those two artists make the music go
somewhere, albeit in a downward
direction. eastmountainsouth retains
the same tempo in every song, har-
monizing vocals the entire time.
Every song feels more or less the
same. Its sleepy-time" formula was a
nice attempt, but there’s also some-
thing called diversity that this band

. severely lacks

If you’re looking for something
in the adult contemporary section
that will attempt to pluck your heart-

..'l > strings, by all means give this record
a spin. The voices are-pretty, but eas--
ily forgettable in the annals of popu- .

lar music. But the swooning vocal
harmonies might keep you interested

‘enough to continue. ’

I advise all serious music fans to

-look elsewhere, such as" Sun Kil
Moon’s fabulous Ghosts of the Great -

Highway. But perhaps with their
next record, eastmountainsouth will

‘ _define themselves as a band instead

of merely providing background
music. A ’ ‘

This decade-old indie synth-pop band is My Favorite

The Happiest Days of Our
Lives
My Favorite
Double Agent Records
7,‘i'7’.‘r‘£(1/2
Recommended if you like:
New Wave in the vein of Joy
Division

A decade ago, depending on the
channel you were listening to,
grunge and gangsta rap were slam-
ming the conventions of authority all
across the airwaves. Music fans ate
it up as the antidote to those ‘80s
hair metal bands and synth-pop’ one-
hit wonders. A band like My
Favorite, who began as a band at the
same time, wouldn’t be able to crack
the mainstream airwaves — they
were too busy creating the kind of
music that grunge and rap were
reacting to. "

They weren’t able tocrack main-.
stream radio then, so not recognizing
them or their sound isn’t surprising.
And with a synth—heavy, new wave
sound — they’ve been labeled new
new wave — My Favorite _isn’t like-_
ly to make it on Top 40 radio any-
time soon. A T ’

Unless, of course, an ‘80s retro
revolution happens and people start
listening to thembecause they sound
like Joy Division, New Order and
early Depeche Mode. But that won’t
happen anytime soon, either

But, even still, they’re creating

music. They’ve released numerous

EPS and one LP, Love at Absolute
Zero. All are stellar albums with an
ethereal, almost otherworldly sound
that concerns itself with placing the

listener in places, like clubs, airports .

and small apartments or
dorms, and various mind-
sets and emotions. Now,
a collection of three of
their limited edition EPs 4
— Joan of Arc Awaiting
Trial, A Cult of One and
The Kids Are All Wrong
— and one “lost” session
— Famous When Dead
— have been collected in
The Happiest Days of
Our Lives.

This set is a nice
package for the few fans
of My Favorite and a
wonderful introduction to
the band for new listen-
ers. By collecting the
three EPs in this one set,
My
Favorite are spared the
legwork of having to .
track down those three of
the band’s albums —

able only on the band’s Web site, so
they were difficult to procure then,
,,and, because they’re no 1onger’pro—
Sduced, even harder to get now. And
it was a nice move on the part of the
band to include the “lost” Famous
When Dead sessions to appeal to
their fans — this way, fans don’t feel
like they’re buying a repackaging of
what they already own.‘

Even better, some of the best
tracks on the album come from those
lost sessions. “James Dean
(Awaiting Ambush)” is a track that

__moves the listener from a lonely,
"dark road to the inside of a teenag-

er’s room, using the death of James
Dean as the vehicle. Lyrics go. from
the crash that killed Dean. (“There

was aterriblecrash/They found his .

still-beating heart in the ash/He’d
turned down a dark road, and was
blinded by a dizzying flash”) to the

reaction ateenager ‘would have to 
the memory of a long-lost idol (“He 1

was a sacred’ disgrace/His eyes as
cold and black as space/And since

his poster came down they’re all I)
can recall of his face”). And while '

such lyrics seem a bit depressing,

they’re sung in an upbeat tempo and _

are. backed by._re.verently upbeat syn’-

thesizers, guitarsand drums that dull -

the pain of whatisbeing sung.
Another standout) from the
Famous‘ When Dead sessions is the
title track. A very upbeat track that is
about as “hard”. as a band like My
Favorite gets, the track ‘concerns a
longing for things long since lost
and other, even more uplifting ‘things
like one’s own mortality and dealing
with death. ‘ -
But . a lyric in the ‘track,
“Nostalgia for meaningful things is
all I’ve ever known,” is emblematic

of this band’s: message. So  of
their -songs are dripping with a’ nos-

talgia) for times and momentsithat
«, don’t exist anymore. A track like
f“Hom’eless" Club Kids” deals with
ghosts of “dead”‘ teenagers dancing

in an otherworldly club. ‘But the kids
aren’t dead; ‘they’ve‘ just grownup.
They’re the kids who dancedwto. the
new wave hits in ‘80s clubs; the kids’
who ’ would’ve appreciiated and
danced to the music My Favorite
makes. But they’re lost to time. §_.

Other tracks, like “L=P” and

“Half There and Dancing,” are won-
derful songs about the power and

pain of loss, compounded by their
lingering presence and the knowl-
edge that nothing‘ can be done to
bring that person back .to you. And
while these are of a melancholy sub-
ject, to say the least, they are some-
how uplifting. They don’t brood on
theloss. Rather, they ponder ques-
tions of the future and,’ despite its
being an imperfect one, the hope it
holds. _

My Favorite is a band that stands
out from the pack, not only because
of their sound, but also because a
range) of emotions and feelings are
conveyed so poignantly and believ-
ably.‘ Many, of their songs might
sound depressing on first listen. But,

. after listening to them a few times

and getting a handle on what the
lyrics are saying, the listener doesn’t
feel down so much as, hopeful with-
out optimism. ,

The Happiest Days of Our Lives
is a collection that might not be for
everyone. But if you give it a chance

'— and you give My -Favorite a
‘ chance —’ you might be_surprised by
‘how good the music is. It isn’t the

bubblegum synth-pop of the ‘80s.
Instead, it’s an arty synth-pop with

A an unconventional way" of getting its

THE PITT NEWS

This party ended three sequels
ago. So everyone go home!

Mario Party 5
Developed by Hudson Soft
Nintendo Gamecube

i‘r1/2

When Nintendo unveiled the
first iteration of “Mario Party” back
in 1999, it was an incredible innova-
tion. Quick, spastic and fun mini-
games were wrapped together in the
form of a board—game track, with the
winner being whoever had the most
stars and coins at the end of a set
number of turns. It was another one
of those “What were they thinking?”
moments that turned into a smash
hit.

However, after 4 more rehashes
of the same. theme, the creative
wellspring seems to have run dry.
“Mario Party 5” is just another in

the progression of cookie—cutter‘

“Mario Party” games, introducing
new elements that provide five min-
utes of freshness for an otherwise
stale game. »
The gameplay hasn’t,changed
since the days of the Nintendo 64.
You roll dice, you move around a
board, you play a mini—game at the
end of each turn to amass coins.

These coins let you buy stars, and .

the player with the most stars at the
end of the game wins. As with any
Mario game, there is a diverse array
of power—ups and familiar characters
to help you slow down, torment and
downright rob your competitors,
though it’s nothing that hasn’t been
done in “Mario Parties” 1 through 4.

This is a game designed to bring
up to four players together, and
you’re going to need all of them. By
leaving just one controller
unmanned, you’re allowing the
near-perfect AI players to invade
your gaming experience with their
uncanny‘ accuracy in what are sup-
posed to be “random” selections.
For your safety, always play with 4
players.

Perhaps the most disappointing 4

aspect of this new incarnation is the
library of rather uninspired, mini-
games. I’m sorry, but there’s noth-
ing fun about choosing a ﬂying ves-
sel at random and sitting around to
watch the race.

All the fun of off—track gambling
withno actual payout!

Add to this a few sub-standard

www.m’:m::ews.eem

 

competition modes ——- like playing
four—player Reversi — and a “card
game” that makes little sense and is
not very fun anyway, and you have a
perfect picture of what the end of a
road looks like.

With the money you’d spend on
“Mario Party 5,” I’d highly recom-
mend buying a used Nintendo 64
and the original “Mario Party.” It’s
just as fun, more enjoyable as a sin-
gle—p1ayer experience,’ and the extra
controllers are cheaper.

sees the word ‘classic’ attached to a —

piece of literature, a certain stigma

the book will be boring, like that

. Charles Dickens crap he read in high

school, or too symbolic, like that
book by George Orwell with all the
animals, .or just too complex, like
the stuff that Ayn Rand person
writes about.

Have a little faith in your own
brain! You made it into college, even
with Pitt’s rising academic stan-
dards, so there has to be at least
some sort of activity going on in that
cranium of yours. And some master-
pieces aren’t difficult to read at all.
Look at “The Catcher in the Rye” or
“To Kill a Mockingbird,” for exam-
ple. These are ‘straightforward sto-
ries that will no doubt leave you
thinking about your world and how
it works. ~

All I’m saying is that a book
doesn’t have to be recent to be inter-
esting. or, compelling. So take a
chance and head to the library for a
little brain food to unwind with once
you’re through cramming for
midterms. ‘

Despite Amy Ku_nich’s best per-

lineup, Pitt was unable to pull out a
win against ‘Rutgers Wednesday night,

falling 75-61.

Playing in her‘ sixth game back
from a foot stress fracture, Kunich

played the entire game, the first time .

this season any Pitt player has played

‘‘I couldn’t take her out,” Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said. “She was
our leader and handled Rutgers’ pres-

, sure really well.”

“I could go another 40 minutes
right now,” said Kunich, answering
any questions about her endurance
coming off the injury.” A

.Kunich and LaToya Kincaid
chipped in with 1.4 points each for Pitt,
while.Cappie Pondexterled all scor-
ers, dropping in 21 points to go along’
with nine rebounds andiseven assists.

seventh in a row and eighth straight to the Scarlet Knights,
drops Pitt to 6-15 overall and 2-9_ in the Big East, while
Rutgers improves to 14-8 and 6-4 in the conference.

Scarlet Knights too physical for Panthers inside

1 RYAN WALKER
— Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
knew it would be in for a physical battle
as it prepared to take on the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights. ‘But as much as they tried

to match up physically, the Lady Panthers‘ -

just could not play the same rugged style
of basketball that Rutgers brought to the

‘ Petersen Events Center on Wednesday.’ 1.

Head coach Agnus Berenato’s
biggest concern ., was , that her _ players
would be intimidated. She wanted to
make sure that her team would be ready
for a battle. 1

“I think Rutgers is one of the more
physical teams we’ll face,’7 Berenato said.
“I’ve watched an awful lot of ﬁlm over
the past three days, and I just knew it was
going to be a slug fest. I just felt like, if we
weren’t intimidated and we went up
strong, then the ofﬁcials were going to

. have to call fouls.”

Pitt was successful in getting to ﬂue

free-throw line, shooting a total of 28 foul '
, shots in the game. The problem was that,

as a team, Pitt was outscored 34-12 in the.
paint. Points in the paint proved to be the ,

difference as tl1e Panthers did not have an
answer for the size and strength of the

' Scarlet Knights. .

Berenato is looking ‘for her team to

play a more physical style of basketball.

Physical play is commonplace in the Big

East Conference and, if the Panthers hope

to be more competitive, they are going to
have to play a more physical game. _j
“We have to get more physical,”
Berenato said. “We have to get more
mentally toughf’
Cappie Pondexter, one of the premier

guards in the country, scored a tearn-high -

21 points, had nine rebounds, seven
assists,’ and three steals. Despite those
strong numbers, ‘Berenato felt that her
team did a good job keeping Pondexter in
check.

“I thought we did a really nice job on
[Pondexter],” Berenato said. “She truly is
one of the best players in the nation.‘ She
had 21 points, but she worked for those
21  . '

Whi1e~Pondexter did put up numbers
well above her season averages, Pitt did
step up and play a more physical game.

The attitude and the intensity were
there from start to ﬁnish. Pitt was hustling
down the ﬂoor trying to score points even
when there was no more than a handful of
seconds left on the clock.

' The Panthers just could not match up
with the -physical ability of the Scarlet
Knights. The mental toughness that

‘Berenato is looking for is starting to show

up. But the size and strength and ability is
still lacking.

Between being out-rebounded 38-29
and being dominated on the inside, Pitt
still has a long way to go before it will be
able to match up with some of the
stronger Big East teams.

Case opens

way for

youngsters 
A A stew

   
 

Last Thursday, U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled in‘
favor of, former Ohio State running
back Maurice Clarett, stating that
the NFL rule prohibiting players
from entering the draft until they
are three years removed from high
school violates antitrust laws. "

The NFL has tried unsuccess-
fully to have that decision suspend-
ed until after an appeal has been
filed, saying that it needs a stay to
avoid “profound adverse conse-
quences.” _

Judge Scheindlin disagreed.

She feels that Clarett has will
be the one most harmed if he is left
out of this year’s draft. While that
may be true, the first signs of trou-
ble for the NFL "have already
appeared. .

Adrian Peterson, Oklahoma’s
top recruit this year, has said that

- he is faster than anyone currently 9
._on the Dallas_Cowboys’ roster. And

if he was shown the money, well,
I’m sure you can figure the rest out
for yourself.

While NFL officials might only
be looking to keep their free minor
league system —- which the rest of
us know as the NCAA — NFL play-
ers are also very upset over the pos-
sibility of high schoolers entering
their league. .

Comments at the Pro Bowl last
weekend ranged from expressions
of sympathy for high school ath-
letes who would consider the jump
to feeling disrespected by them.
The bottom line is that NFL players
want draftees to have paid their
dues just like everyone who came
before them.

Fitzgerald’s stay full of excitement and respect

 

One of the best wide receivers in
college football history sat in front a
crowd of reporters on the South Side
Monday and told them that he will,
without a doubt, return to school to
get his degree, just not this year. He
made a promise to his late mother and
plans on keeping it, no matter how
long it takes.

What is it about Larry Fitzgerald
that makes me believe him?

After weeks of speculation,
Fitzgerald officially announced that
he will forego his final two years of
college and enter the National
Football League draft in April. Now,
while everyone, including myself,
should be happy that Pitt had him for
those two, no one can help but wish
Pitt had just one more. ' t

On the field, he will be missed.

Off the field, he may be missed even
more. Fitzgerald brought more posi-
tive attention to this University than
anyone since Dan Marino and Tony
Dorsett, and those two were on teams
that seriously contended for the
national title.

Fitzgerald played on a team that

’ many believe cost him the Heisman

Trophy. Individual awards or not,
Fitzgerald stood as a figure that kids
— or adults — could look up to. "

Watching grown men swoon
while waiting in line behind a group
of five—year—olds for his autograph at
a Pitt basketball game was priceless,
but how can I make fun of them? ‘I
got his autograph as well. A friend of
mine grabbed his John Hancock dur-
ing a fire drill. _

Fitzgerald made a splash in the
national media by handing the ball to
the referee after scoring‘ touchdowns
instead of pulling out a Sharpie, cell
phone, two—way pager or anything
else people can find.

He was nearly perfect during a
time that featured Kobe Bryant being
accused of rape, _St. John’s players
allegedly sneaking out of the hotel to
go to a strip club before ending the

night with group sex, and Miami’s
top football recruit violating his pro-
bation. The recruit had been arrested
10 times between 1999-2002.

NFL analysts have compared
Fitzgerald to Jerry Rice, widely
acclaimed as the best wide receiver to
ever put on a helmet and shoulder
pads. Fitzgerald is too modest to
accept such a comparison, but he also
isn’t t_oo shy to make sure everyone
understands he has confidence. He
made it clear to the media on Monday
that he believes he can play at the
next level and be successful.

Again, what is it about Fitzgerald
makes me believe him? ‘

During the press conference
Monday, his beaming father, Larry
Fitzgerald Sr., stood off to the side
silently supporting his son as he
made a life-altering decision. His
father was instrumental in keeping
Larry Jr., focused this season after his
year started out worse thanrimagin-
able.

Before the football season even
started, Larry had lost his mother, and
friend and teammate Billy Gaines.
Undoubtedly, it was a tough time for

Larry, but he maintained his goals

and vowed to accomplish them.

Mission accomplished.

Pitt fans will always remember
his elegant, jaw-dropping catches,
like the one in traffic against Texas
A&M or the one against West
Virginia where he got spun around
and interfered with but managed to
catch the ball and, of course, hand it
to the referee. 

Numerous students will forever
tell stories of their “run in” with
“Fitz,” whether he was in their psy-
chology class or lived in their apart-
ment building. Fitzgerald said
Monday that Pitt has done a lot for
him, but the truth is, he did :way more
for Pitt than possibly any Panther in
history. -

Fitzgerald could have proclaimed
that he lived by the’ creed, “Ask not
what your school can do‘ for you but
what you can do for your school.”

I would have believed him.

Matt Sortino is a staﬂ writer for The
‘Pitt News, and will forever remember
being at Pitt while Fitzgerald was
here. He wishes him all the luck and
thanks Larry for being who he was.

Nothing needs to change —-— hockey is fine the way it is

    

I’m dropping my gloves.

You may throw me in the penalty
box for five minutes or even give me a
game misconduct, but it must be done.

I’m fighting for hockey.

Hockey is an amazing game and
this past weekend featured "the 54th
NHL All-Star game. Even though it
wasn’t as exciting as last year’s
shootout, it was still a great game.

Qn Tuesday, all 30 general man-
agers met to see if they could come up
with ways to “fix the game.”

What did these 30 geniuses come
up with?

First of all, they want to make it
illegal for goalies to touch the puck
after it passes the back—end red line,
which means behind the net. NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman said that
they are looking at making it a two-
minute penalty if the goalie breaks
this rule. 7

The GMs also said they would like if

to cut down the size of goalie pads
from 12 inches to 10. L

What else was on their list of pos-
sibilities?

They had ideas like three points in
the standings for a victory instead of
the current two points and a two—point
award to a team who wins in overtime
or in a. shootout.

Also in the running was the rein-
statement of tag—up offsides. This
allows someone who is offsides to go
out and re—enter . the zone without a
whistle blowing. \

An outrageous suggestion was for
teams to be allowed to have a power

A play for the full two minutes, even if

they score — it would be like a five-
minute major, Where the penalized
player has to stay in the box no matter
what. . V

Why is Bettman doing this?

Because scoring is down and so is
fan support. Only diehards and
Canadians _are finding the game ‘enter-
taining to watch and Bettman is doing
what he thinks is best to make the
game more “watchable.”

But one question remains: Will it
work? ‘

Not exactly. I do think the game
would be better off with a shootout to
decide overtime and get rid of ties, but
other than that, there is no need for
change.

Bettman is under the impression
that it takes scoringpto make hockey

exciting, but that is not what this game
is all about. There are so many other
little things that make hockey one of
the best sports out there, such as hit-
ting, great moves, great shots and
great saves..

Hockey fans don’t just cheer when

»a goal is scored. Hockey fans are

much like the players on the ice; they
keep going, whether applauding a
great play or a hard, exhilarating,‘ hit
or even just chanting an opposing
goa1tender’s last name to get into his
head.

So what needs to be done? The
rules should stay the same. The only

problem needing attention is the finan— V

cial disparity between different NHL
markets. It’s the same problem Major
League Baseball needs to deal with.
There are powerhouses with money,
like the New Jersey Devils and
Philadelphia Flyers. And then there
are the great sports towns that cannot
compete financially, like Pittsburgh.
The NHL: needs to follow the
example of the NFL, so that small
markets can be competitive, too. They

need to bring hope to these small mar-‘

kets in order to get more people inter-
ested in the game. Once the NHL does
this, fan support will grow because

small ‘markets —-— like Pittsburgh,
whose home attendance has dropped
for six straight years — will have a
,chance to contend and then people
will head ‘to the arena to see their
home team.

Well, I’ve made my argument for
hockey. We’ll just see if the players
‘fight as hard as they do on the ice to
keep the gamethe way it is.

Jimmy Johnson is a staﬁ writer for
The Pitt News and  it weren’t for
hockey, Canada would just be good
for its Molson and Labatt’s Blue prod-
ucts.

JESS COFFEY/FOR THE P177 Ilhsws

LaToya -Kincaid tries to go up through two Scarlet Knight defenders during the
Panthers’ loss. Kincaid and Amy Kunich led Pitt with 14 points each.

Scarlet Knights dominate
Panthers inside the paint

Loss, page 15

Kunich said. “We have to score to
win, and we haven’t been scoring that
many points the past couple of
games.”

' The teams would trade baskets for
the first‘ eight minutes of the game,
with Rutgers holding a 16-14 advan-
tage with 11:51 remaining in the half.

But the Scarlet Knights 1 would
score 11 of the next 12 points to grab
a 12-point lead that the Panthers
would not be able to overcome.
Rutgers was able to keep a double-
digit lead for most-of the half, but Pitt
would not go away quietly.

Katie Histed cut the deficit to nine
points with 4:38 remaining in the first
half after scoring on an outlet pass
from Stacey Moore, After the Scarlet

Knights built their lead back to 11 .
points, the Panthers cut it to five with ‘

less than a minute remaining follow-
ing two free throws and a layup by
Kunich. ‘

Pitt looked to cut the lead down
even more ‘before halftime, but
Rebecca Richman finished a layup to
give Rutgers a 38-31 lead at halftime.

The Panthers used the momentum
to cut into the lead in the second half.
Histed nailed a three-pointer to open
the half to pull Pitt within four, but
that was as close as the Panthers
would get.

Rutgers went on a 15-5 run to
build its lead up to 14 points follow-
ing a three-pointer by Pondexter —
one of three she hit on the night.

Pitt scrapped back, pulling within
11 after another three by Histed cut
the lead to 57-46 with 10:56 remain-
ing in the game. But the Scarlet
Knights were able to use their height
advantage inside the paint to increase

‘their lead to 17 points with 4:38

remaining.

Rutgers outscored the Panthers
34-12 in the paint and out—rebounded
Pitt, 38-29. The Scarlet-Knights also
blocked five Pitt shots, led by
Richman who had five.

The‘ Panthers seemed to gain a lit-
tle hope when they cut Rutgers’ lead
to 12 after five quick points from
Sheila Stufﬂet, who finished the game
with six points.

“Sheila is the glue to our team,”
Berenato said. “She is a sense of bal-
ance to our team. I was happy to see
her score. She must look to be more
aggressive.”

But it wasn’t enough as the
Scarlet Knights held on to win the
game.

The Panthers will return to action
on Saturday to face the Georgetown
Hoyas. Tip—off is scheduled for 2 p.m.
at the Petersen Events Center.

Players should have to prove themselves in college before becoming pros

Walker, page 15

Oops, did I say everyone?

There once was a young man by
the name of Andy Livingston.
While his name might not ring any
bells yet, it soon will. You see,
Livingston is the man the NFL
doesn’t want you to know about, the
man the league tries to forget about.

The reason?

Livingston was the first player
ever to govfrom high school straight

‘ into the NFL.

He was married and had a child

V while still in high school and was

never able to graduate. The com-

 

' -.’

s  .

. man are: ;i?;pi;§;g2i;ii1.!:;lé‘l«

 ,I8Ll

   

missioner of the NFL at the time,
Pete Rozelle, gave Livingston a
hardship exemption.

Livingston went on to have a
fairly successful NFL career. The 6-
foot-1, 235-pound fullback played
seven seasons with the ‘Bears and
Saints between 1964 and 1970.

But the NFL was a different
game back then. T 1 .

There isn’t an 18-year-old on
the planet that could‘ handle a hit
from Ray Lewis or fight through an
Orlando Pace block. The NFL is not
the NBA. Football is a game that
requires physical maturity and
durability.

     
       

 

  

‘ though,

Maybe there are a handful of
guys who could make the jump and
turn out all right. In the long run,
if such a move were
allowed, it'would do a lot more
harm than good.

It seems as though the current
regulations will have to be modi-
fied, which is the right move. Three
years removed from high school
does seem unfair. Why not one or
two years?

Clarett’s attorney has stated that
he will ,,be in this year’s draft.
Clarett had an amazing freshman
season and helped lead his team to a
national championship. But after

Tired of searchingfor the
    perfect apartment?  

sitting out last season, many are
unsure as to just how high of a draft
pick Clarett will be.

Players must prove themselves
at the college level before turning
pro. As of now, the door is open for
anyone who wishes to declare him
or herself eligible for the draft.

But hopefully, for the sake of
the game, the NFL will win its
appeal and not allow -high school
kids to turn pro.
