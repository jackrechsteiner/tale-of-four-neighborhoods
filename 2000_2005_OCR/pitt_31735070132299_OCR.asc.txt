Freedom A Company, a part of , the 28th

Signal Battalion, spmializes in providing _

communicationsicapabilities to the soldiers.

“Most likely, the soldiers would not be
patrolling,” Company Commander Capt
John Prendergast said. However, A
Company faces the same threats as the other
soldiers in the theater.

“We have to be soldiers ﬁrst,”
Prendergast said. '

Before ﬂying to Baghdad in the spring,
the soldiers will undergo intense training at

...Fort Polk, La., where they will have a mis-

sion rehearsal exercise.

Mimicking the conditions the soldiers
will likely face in Iraq, the n1ission—rehearsal
exercise will feature mock terrorist attacks

preformed by a group of specialized sol—'

paid to portray authentic civilians, who the
solders may encounter while deployed in

Iraq. -

Communication is essential to a suc-
cessful campaign in Iraq, according to
Prendergast

“If the enemy destroys communica-

tions, he can destroy what we are trying to
accomplish,” Prendergast explained.

The struggle of the black community
at Pitt is storied and ongoing, Bebe Moore
Campbell said on Wednesday.

“For you who came after, I want you
to know, we had you in mind,” Campbell

_ said. , .

Campbell, a novelist and Pitt alumna,

her current passion for educating people _

about mental illness.

In the second event of BAS Black
Week, a weeklong program of events to
celebrate black history and culture,
Campbell described the ﬁght in the late
1960s to force the University to hire more
black faculty members and recruit more
black students.- “We read [our demands

proudly,” Campbell said. “And he listened
to us. ’

Pitt makes instant coffeehouse

MALLORY WOMER
Staff Writer

On Wednesday night, the Pitt Club
ceased to be the Pitt Club. " I
- For one night, it became a coffee-
house — with the help of Jude‘Kastle
and Hannah Rowley.

Kastle performed Wednesday
night at the Pitt Club in an atmosphere
reminiscent of an intimate coffee-
house. Pitt Program Council sponsored
the event. _ I

“One of my goals coming into "this
year as Arts Director was to get a cof-
feehouse done,” said Rowley, the arts
director for Pitt Program Council.

' “There’s something about being in col-

lege and hearing underground, up—and—
coming stuff.” Kastle kept the perfor-
mance casual by chatting with mem-
bers of‘ the audience. She shared
details about her trip to Pittsburgh,
describing how terrible the’ Yahoo!
Directions were, and she joked about
her songwriting process. ,

“I think when you write a new
song, it becomes your favorite, -at least
for the moment,” Kastle told the
crowd. “I wonder if it’s that way with
kids — I don’t have any.” -'

“And I don’t think that I’d make a
very good mother!” she added, after

thinking for a moment.
Although the room was not
packed, those in attendance seemed to

greatly enjoy what they heard.

“She was amazing,” said'Eva

Kokopeli, a Pitt student. “I loved her

covers, but I loved her own stuff even
more.”

Others heard Kokopeli raving
about Kastle and decided to join in.

“You could connect so well,”
Abby Awosogba said.

“I listened to some of her clips
online, and she exceeded my expecta-
tions,” Megan Chananie added.

Kokopeli, Awosogba and
Chananie agreed that the room should
have been packed with Pitt students.

According to Rowley, the excite-
ment in the Pitt Program Council
office prior to the performance equaled
the excitement exhibitedby Kokopeli
and her peers.

For Kastle, the experience of play-
ing in front of college students is a rel-
atively new one. Though she has only
been touring universities for about a
year, her performance Wednesday was
another instance of her achieving a
lifelong desire. ’

“My father is a preacher,” she said.
“I grew up singing in a church. I’ve

always wanted to be a singer.”

nonﬁction look at the changing dynamics
of gender roles in the family.
Campbell concluded her speech by

discussing her most recent works, her ﬁrst .
play and children’s book, both of which"

dealt with mental illness.

Campbell read the book, titled
“Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry,” to
her audience. P -

“We don’t talk about [mental illness]
in the black community,” Campbell whis-
pered sarcastically. “There should be no

\ ‘stigma about mental illness.” _
She then explained the steps someone »

could take to assist a family member or
friend suffering with a mental illness.
“My journey from Pitt student to ele-

mentary teacher, to writer, to editor has 1

been uphill, downhill, smooth and
rugged,” Campbell said. “I’ve struggled,
but I keep on climbing. ‘

“For those of you who came after,
you’re on your journey now, making
memories, shaping your future with each
choice that you make. So I challenge you
to be bold and wise, to tryharder [and] to
prepare yourselves,” she said. _ ,

“And know that we who came before
you are watching you.”

Police: Your Rights and Responsibilities.”
The event ﬁlled Room 207 of David

capacity, as Emery and speakers from the
American Civil Liberties Union and Black

. The Pitt Police were invited to speak,
but declined, citing a scheduling conﬂict
“You need statistics; you need to pre-
pare yourself,” said Pitt Police Chief Tim
Delaney. “I just can’t devote any time right
now.” ,. ‘
Delaney added that he encourages dia-

-logue between the Pitt police and students,
not only as a “one-time affair,” but armual— ‘

ly. He said he frequently meets with groups
at the beginning of the school year, and
again at the end, to review the year. 

_ “For it to be a positive, interactive
thing, I’m not going to debate anybody,” he
said, addressing the possible format of the
forum. — 1

One thing that the groups at the forum

N.Y. kids should be tried as juveniles

Three Long Island high school var-
sity football players are being tried as
juveniles for alleged sexual assault of
their freshman teammates, as reported
in a Nov. 13 article in The New York
Times.

The ruling, made in Wayne
County, in northeastern Pa., upset the
freshmen’s relatives, most of whom
didn’t supply their full names. Neither
the names of freshmen nor the accused
were included in the article, because
all were juveniles.

In light of the crimes, the ruling
made by Judge Robert Conway was
fair. The crimes they committed were
juvenile — horrible extensions of haz-
ing at its absolute worst. The players
are accused of sodomizing their team-
mates with broomsticks, pine cones
and golf balls, and, if convicted as
juveniles, may be detained until
they’re 21.

Looking beyond the gruesomeness
of the crime, Conway’s decision was
the right one. If tried as adults, the
players could have been imprisoned
for up to 20 years.

These kids’ alleged actions were
mistakes — terrible, brutal ones —
and, if responsible, they should be held
culpable for them. No one is contesting
this.

But prison should not be
vengeance — no amount of time‘
behind bars will undo what has been
done.

Convicting 16- and l7—year—olds as
adults essentially means throwing their
lives away —— and 20 years in prison at
a young age would be just that. As it is,
if they’re convicted, they sacriﬁce high
school, college and much of their lives.

Much will be made of who’s
responsible for these crimes, if the
upperclassmen are convicted.
Whenever groups of teen—agers act in
inexplicably vile, violent ways,
responsibility always rests not only on
the shoulders of the teens themselves,
but also on their parents, the school
district and the other adults supervis-
ing them —- in this case, ‘coaches,
who’ve all been removed, as the foot-
ball season at their high school was
cancelled.

Were these alleged crimes part of
football culture and the permissiveness
given student athletes? Were they tra-
dition run horribly awry, initiation
taken to an awful extreme? Did the
accused lack,a solid contract delineat-
ing players’ conduct and punishment
received, so that behavior will never
again begin to approach what hap-
pened?

Perhaps it is a mixture of all three.
As long as the reports remain vague,
it’s hard to tell. But it seems necessary
for schools to hold athletes to the same
standard as all other students —-— and
for thealleged crimes, a few lessons in
human decency would have gone a
long way. 2

It looks like Chi Chi’s will be reopening.

For those of you who have no idea what I’m talking
about, I am referring to the Chi Chi’s restaurant in Beaver
County that is suspected of spreading Hepatitis A to an
unsuspecting public. <Insert joke relating to diseases in
Beaver here.>

According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, there are currently 340 con-
ﬁrmed cases that have been linked to the
same outbreak. Several» of the more .
severe cases are right_here in Oakland —
UPMC Presbyterian has ﬁve patients in
fair condition and two in critical condi-
tion -— and another 8,230 people who
had possible symptoms were immu-
nized. One person even died.

The question then becomes,
“People are eating at Chi Chi’s?”

Oh well, I guess it was_ Ronald
Reagan who said “He who lives in sin
will die in sin,” though that comment

was a conﬁrmed fabrication by the mak- . V
have it up? What happened to the streets and cars lined with

ers of the CBS “Reagan” movie. But it still sounds good.

In all seriousness though, this is a sad situation. People
are sick I’ve heard of a case where a family of four is sick
with Hepatitis A, the father and mother too sick to care for
their children. 0 _ . \

No matter what happens, the psychological impact on
people from this event will no doubt cause other Chi Chi’s
restaurants and even other restaurants in general to see a
drop in customers and more scrutiny of food handling poli-
c1es.~ »

I After all, how many of you are reading this while eat-
ing a sandwich and wondering what might lurk within?

According to several medical Web sites, Hepatitis A is

“It would be
safer to stay
home and eat

- burritos.”

Nick Kratsas
Contributing Editor

tasteless and odorless, is contained in feces and an infected
person can spread the virus for up to two weeks before
symptoms appear. ‘

When an employee with the virus prepares food, and
does not wash his or her hands well after using the bath-
room, the customer is exposed to the virus by eating cont-

aminated food or placing a contaminated uten-
sil or other object in his or her mouth. The
virus incubates in’ an infected person for an
average of 28 days.

Surely, the more paranoid restaurant goer
will see this and say, “I guess it would be safer
to stay home and microwave processed burri-
tos.” Many people will stop eating out for fear
of being sick Even more will stay indoors for
fear of being infected wit.h Hepatitis A from

0 anyone. , ‘

But like the surge, then wane, of the
patriotism America saw after Sept. 11, 2001,
this toowill go away. After all, how many of
those people who rushed to stores in the weeks
following Sept. 11, 2001, to buy a ﬂag still

red, white and blue? We are a people of short-term memo-
ry, and in time Chi Chi’s will shrug off thisproblem and
return to its prominent position as a purveyor of mediocre
Mexican food.

An interesting fact that people in the press gloss over
is that the corporate headquarters closed the Chi Chi’s vol-
untarily. According to Chi Chi’s Website, physicians, to
ensure healthy conditions, are investigating the restaurant
privately, and the particular restaurant in question had
scored 94 out of 100 in recent health inspections prior to
this incident.

Soon the restaurant may be opened with a clean bill of

Reaffirming your faith in mediocre Mexican restaurants

health.

Bill Zavertnik, the Chief Operating Oﬁicer of the
restaurant chain named even went as far as olfering apolo-
gies to victims, even though there is no deﬁnite link that the
restaurant caused the outbreak, according to a release on
the company’s Web site. _

Even today, Center for Disease Control ofﬁcials are
saying that the conﬁrmed cases, 340, far exceed the normal
amount of cases from one restaurant, and the number of
conﬁrmed cases appears to not be peaking.

Because of this, the CDC is investigating other causes
for the outbreak, as reports of conﬁrmed cases of Hepatitis
A in other restaurant employees in the area pour in.

Most recently, oﬁicials are saying it could have come
from contaminated green onions that were the cause of
recent Hepatitis A outbreaks in restaurants in Georgia and
Tennessee, according to the Post-Gazette.

So now I guess we wait for the lawsuits. After all, this
is the United States, where everyone is litigation-happy.
I’m all for people getting monetary reimbursements for
medical bills and lost work, but I don’t believe in the idea
of “pain and suffering.”

A company that is sued for making people sick should
take care of those people, but the notion that someone
needs vast amounts of money beyond their medical bills
and lost wages is wrong. That’s why our state is in such a
mess with malpractice suits.

And since Chi Chi’s is attempting to handle this situa-
tion as openly as possible, there is no reason to hold
mosity to the restaurant chain.

In fact, to survive perfectly in this paranoid world, you
probably shouldn’t be going out of your house in the ﬁrst
place.

U.S. motives for deporting Canadian man to Syria unclear

Over the weekend, news broke about _

Maher Arar, who has Canadian and Syrian
dual-citizenship, but lived in the former
country until he was arrested by ofﬁcials in
the United States and deported to Syria in
2002.
A His comments about his forced sojourn
— read: imprisonment and torture — in
Syria prompted the Center for
Constitutional Rights to demand an investi-
gation by Attorney General John ‘Ashcroft
into Arar’s treatment. . '
The first question that springs to my
mind is: How‘ could the United States
decide the country of which Arar was more
a citizen? Syria clearly won, but why?
President Bush has criticized Syria for
its links to terrorist organizations. Amnesty
Intemational’s Web site provides a laundry

list of Syria’s infractions — torture and‘

arresting “prisoners of conscience” seem to
be recurring themes. Why, then, did the
United States send ‘Arar there, rather than
pleasant, death-penalty-free Canada, the
country in which Arar chose to live?

The answer appears to be that this
country now has outside contractors for its
dirty work The Eighth Amendment pro-
hibits torture? No problem! Syria has no
such qualms or judicial hang-ups.

Now, I like my soapbox. I’ve grown

into it —— it has little outlines where my feet
go, and “Life Buoy” written on the side.
And when I heard about Arar’s case, I knew‘
that I could easily rant about the decline of
the justice system and blah blah blah. I’m a
college student, and a college journalist, so
part of my job is railing against what I see
as the Great‘ Injustices of the
World — note the capitaliza-
tion; there will be a test. '

But for all the outrage, lit-
tle is done. The Pitt News ran a
U-Wire story Nov. 7 about how
protestors need a uniﬁed mes-
sage to avoid the appearance of
being a bunch of longhaired
idiots with puppets. Style
issues aside, the writer did have
a point — there needs to be a
rallying cry, one felt both on the
streets and in the polls.

And so here is Arar’s case; he seems
like a worthy poster—boy for addressing the
GIotWs. ,

_ To kick-start this, I did a bit of research.
All political action should begin with prop-
er research. One of my activist friends

' spends most of her days reading newspa-
pers, both domestic and foreign, trying to
piece together truth ﬁom slanted reporting.’
As a result, she can talk about any political

issue with authority, citing multiple reliable
sources, the benchmark of a good argu-
ment.

‘So in an effort to get people not only
outraged, but also informed, I researched. I
don’t pretend to be unbiased — this is an
Opinions column after all. But my sources
are mostly Canadian, with the
occasional U.S. or English
newspaper thrown in.

I didn’t include what Al-
Jazeera said, because it was a
rundown of what everyone
else said, and, on a search, the
Pittsburgh Tribune—Review’s
and The Washington Times’
Web sites didn’t yield any
articles concerning Arar.

Here’s what I found:

Arar wasarrested in New
York in September 2002, and
deported to Syria, where he said he was tor-
tured, beaten and kept in a cell he called “a'
grave,” according to an article in the Nov.
11 edition of The Washington Post.

The article also termed the process of
deporting people to countries known for
their lovely torture practices as “rendition”
— because giving it a totally nondescript
name makes this totally gruesome proce-
dure more palatable, of course.

_ Arar’s already got a lawyer, Lorne
Waldman, and a list of complaints concem-
ing how the media is handling his case,
according to the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation.

And others are using his case as an
example of unfair treatment and detention.

The Globe and Mail, based in Toronto,
listed the others who, seeing Arar’s case,
hope to use it as an example of the dubious
detention practices. Some of the complaints
are on behalf of people on the FBI’s Most
Wanted List.

The London Free Press reported that
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
demanded answers from U.S. Secretary of
State Colin Powell, but Canadian Foreign
Affairs Munster Bill Graham stated that
these answers might never come, according
to The Ottawa Citizen.

Got that? Arar’s case provides a lot to
digest, and even more to understand.

But outrage without‘ backing facts is
just hot air. So before you start growing
your hair and damning the man, start read-
ing. You just might learn something.

assert that it may be long, but it does not
smell like hippy. Both she and it can be

Austrailian ro

Garage Days

Starring Kick Gurry, Maya
Stange, Brett Stiller, Marton
Csokas, Chris Sadrinna, Pia
Miranda, Russell Dykstra
Directed by Alex Proyas
ﬁt} 1/2

“Garage Days” tells the story of a
band in Australia trying to hit the big time
in an environment where live music has
taken a backseat to Pokies, a type of slot
machine popping. up in. bars and club
across the country. . ,. c

The end result isn’t as promising as
the set-up. .

The undeniable focus of the ﬁhn is the

band, comprised of four different person-.

alities. Freddy (Kick Gurry) is the wide-
eyed dreamer, lead singer and guitarist.
He’s in a relationship with bassist Tanya
(Pia Miranda), a girl a little too antsy and
wild for Freddy’s more grounded, sexual-
ly boring lifestyle. Tanya lusts after drum-
mer Lucy (Chris Sadrinna), a crazy, drug-
dealing type who lives life on the edge —
which he regularly arrives at via various
colorful pills. Rounding out the group of
musicians is lead guitarist Joe (Brett
Stiller), a socially uncomfortable person
with a splintered psyche and a girlfriend,
Kate (Maya Stange), who’s better adjusted
and is lusted after by Freddy. But it just so
happens Freddy and Joe are best friends,
so a Yoko situation is brewing within the
ranks.

Compounding all the problems within
the band itself — friend lusting after
friend’s girl (or guy), clashes of personali-
ties and other normal band stuff —— they
can’t ﬁnd anywhere to play. And when
they do get a gig, their manager Bruno
(Russell Dykstra) ﬁnds a way to screw it
up. In one case, he sends the band to the
wrong club, thus blowing the gig. To rem-

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

edy this, Freddy seeks out hot manager
Shad Kern (Marton Csokas). But that, too,
poses its own set of problems. ’ '

This band can’t get a break, and the
loud, obnoxious lights and sounds of the
Pokies are all around to mock.

But there’s a problem facing the audi-
ence, too —— ﬁguring out why we should
care about the band, their problems and
the Pokies.

Watching the ﬁlm, you ﬁnd yourself
wanting to see more of the struggle of
bands like this one against the environ-
ment of the Pokies. Instead, all we get is
the blah tale of the band and its members.
The characters are uninteresting on the
whole, and as a result, their situations are,
too. This isn’t the fault of any of the actors.
They all pull more than their weight, with

Dykstra, Stange and Miranda being the
standouts. It’s just that they have nothing
to work with. .
This becomes all the more frustrating,
because the ﬁlm ‘is wildly, wonderfully
directed by Alex Proyas. “Garage Days” is
shot, at points, like a music video and, at
all times, like the ﬁlm is happening in
some weird, non-existent fantasy land.
There are places in the ﬁlm devoted to a
single character, where the action happens
in slow motion while we hear the inner
monologue of the in-focus character.
While these moments add a little to the
narrative, they’renotable for how dynam-
ic they are and how fun they are to watch.
Worse, the ﬁlm_has ,a killer sound-
track. True, the one thing a rock ‘n’ roll
picture can’t screw up is the soundtrack,

“Our freedom of speech is freedom or
death. We got to ﬁght the powers that
be ”

— Public Enemy, ‘-‘Fight the Power”

kers ompete wit slots

but this one excels, with a good smattering
of eclectic bands and styles of rock. It’s
just too bad the soundtrack doesn’t have
anything to support.

There are parts to “Garage Days” that
work really well. But when they are put
together with the aspects of the ﬁlm that
don’t work, the ﬁlm fails to please.
“Garage Days” is fLm to watch, but is ulti-
mately a disappointing and unfulﬁlling
experience.

Pit Bull of Comedy is sure to offend everyone

Everyone loves a good laugh, and it’s even better
when it’s a dirty laugh. Bobby Slayton has been dubbed
as “The Pit Bull of Comedy,” and is notorious for his
ﬁlthy sense of humor. .

Slayton has been doing standup for 25 years and
has been heralded as extremely energetic and one of the
best known on the road. Slayton is touring in support of
his upcoming comedy CD, Raging Bully. The one—hour
live disc will contain topics such as the death penalty,
romance, porn and even sexism.

Slayton has even been in ﬁlms; he starred opposite
Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton in the ﬁlm

“Bandits.” Also, he was in the David Spade movie
released this year, “Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.”
He’s had minor roles in “The Rat Pack,” “Loser,” “Get
Shorty,” “Ed Wood” and “Wayne’s World 2.”

Besides his ﬁlm career, Slayton has a HBO series
called “The Mind of a Married Man,” which airs on
Sunday nights at 10:30 p.m. Slayton has been on tele-
vision talk shows such as “Laterl,” “The Tonight
Show” and “Politically Incorrect.” His radio career also
has A—List shows such as ‘The Howard Stern Show,”
“Tom Leykis” and the “Kevin & Bean Morning Show.”
This is quite an ambitious man when it comes to com-

edy. ~
S Slayton has also won the American Comedy
Awards’ “Funniest Male Stand-Up Comic of the Year.”
In any case, it should be a memorable night full of
laughs and gags at the theater this weekend.

Bobby Slayton will perform at the Improv in
Homestead tonight at 8 p.m. and I0 p.m., tomorrow at
7p.m., 9p.m. and I] p.m., and Sunday, Nov. 16, at 7

Matt Sharp, formerly of Weezer

Pittsburgh tonight, armed with songs
off of his solo EP, Puckett Versus the
Country Boy, and his forthcoming
fu11—1ength solo album, Matt Sharp.

Sharp’s sound on his EP is some-
thing different from his previous
work. It’s a stripped-downlsound that
features‘ only the essential instru-

ments. On the four tracks, it’s rare“ to"

hear anything other than a lone
acoustic guitar, muted drum work, a
piano and a background instrument

establishing a feeling of escape. He’s
able to do this through the one—two

his strong lyrics. The four tracks on
the EP are rich songs that leave the

  Nineties nostalgia beginning to setin

Ahh, the 1990s. I know you get nostalgic
thinking about those days at the lunch table,
Simpsons lunchbox in tow, munching on a Fruit
by the Foot, sipping your Snapple and fighting
over whether Tonya Harding was behind the
attack on Nancy Kerrigan. Whether you want to
fess up or not, the ‘90s were a kick—ass decade.

These were the thoughts I had a few days ago
as I zoned out in front of yet another “I Love the
‘80s Strikes Back” marathon on VH1. They’ve
done the ‘80s, tackled the ‘70s and served up sec-
onds of the Age of the Yuppies —— so it’s just
inevitable that there will come a day in the future
when you can watch endless hours of B—list
celebrities dish about everything ‘90s. So I decid-
ed to get a little nostalgic and reminisce about the
good old days —— or, just the old days. I mean, it
wasn’t all good. Remember Furbies?

The decade was full of historical moments.
The Berlin Wall fell, Bill Clinton was elected
president, Princess Diana died and everybody
thought the world was going to end at the stroke
of midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, because of the Y2K
bug. The O.J. Simpson trial captivated America,
and when the verdict was announced, it became
clear that racial tensions were still very real in our
country. Dolly the sheep grew out of cloned eggs
and El Nino rocked the Weather Channel’s world.
The Unabomber turned out to be a crazy,
unshaven man who lived in a shack in the woods
and two Colorado students opened fire on their
classmates and teachers as the _decade wound to a
close.

Grunge broke out onto the scene at the begin-
ning of the ‘90s, with Nirvana at its forefront. Rap
came of age during the decade. Gone were the
days when DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince
rhymed about how parents just don’t understand;
now we heard groups like Public Enemy fighting
the power, and we witnessed the East Coast-West
Coast rap wars. As the decade steamed along,
society was inundated with cheesy bubblegum
pop music acts: Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Spice
Girls, Christina Aguilera, and, of course, Britney
Spears.

I’ll never forget the first time I watched
“Silence of the Lambs” —— just typing-the title
makes me shiver. Even though the movie came out
in 1991, I was only seven at the time — not exact-
ly mature enough to hear about Hannibal Lecter’s
fondness for Chianti and fava beans. It was not
until five years later that I let a girl I was baby-sit-
ting talk me into watching it with her. As you can

probably guess, her parents
came home to her and me
huddled together on the
couch, her head practically
molded to my ribcage. It’s
still the scariest movie I’ve
ever seen.

The first Star Wars pre-
quel, “The Phantom
Menace,” was released in
1999 amid much fanfare
and —- once everybody saw
it — really loud boos, at
least in the theater where I
saw it. “Jurassic Park”
allowed dinosaur geeks’
minds to run wild with the possibility that one day
we could bring those gigantic lizards back to life,
“The Blair Witch Project” took a camcorder into
the woods and scared the hell out of America in
the process, and “American Pie” lovingly chroni-
cled what happens when you mix adolescent boys’
with baked goods. Oh, and this little movie called
“Titanic” came out, too.

Television expanded its horizons in the ‘90s.
NBC introduced the concept of Must—See TV, with

 

Christina Cann

  

“Friends” and “Seinfeld” anchoring the two—hour ’

comedy block to smashing success. It became
possible to get your news fix anytime, anywhere,
with 24-hour news channels like CNN, CNN
Headline News, and — if you want a “fair and
balanced” look at events — Fox News. Jerry
Springer showed America just how trashy life can
be on his talk show, whose guests regularly came
to fisticuffs.

Plenty of fads came and went during the
decade. Every woman in America wanted a
“Rachel” haircut, people embraced fanny packs
until they realized just how damn stupid they
looked wearing them, and mehndi tattoos were the
rage circa my seventh—grade year. The ‘90s decade
brought with it a whole new set of vocabulary,
such as “da bomb,” “my bad,” “as if!,” “all that,”
—- which sometimes carried the attachment “and a
bag of chips” — “bling bling,” and, my personal
favorite, “whatever!”

I know I’ve probably missed some of your
favorite ‘90s moments in this column. You can’t
possibly expect me to encapsulate every single
thing that happened in the glorious days of our
youth. If that’s what you want, I have just one
thing to say to you: talk to the hand, because the
face ain’t listening. B

Japanese contemporary
dance troupe performs

Fluorescent lights streak the backdrop. Dancers
move like robots across the stage like graceful
swans, in the techno-theatrical experimentation that
is emerging in Japan today. “Dumb Type in
MemoRandum” introduces to us the aftermath of a
fairy tale and how our minds distort these memories.

The Kyoto-based contemporary performance
ensemble Dumb Type, formed in 1984, is one of
Japan’s leading ensembles. In its Pittsburgh debut,
MemoRandum presents this narrative by twisting
classic childhood stories together to trigger our
fondest — or our most feared —— memories.
“Goldilocks and the Three Little Bears” and “Jack

and the Beanstalk,” among other stories, unravel in I

a unique form onstage.

The opening scene involves a layered text pro-
jection and vocalization based on the fairytale
“Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” Dancers sneak
onto the stage, crawling, while the images; of the
dancers climbing words until they reach the top of
the screen is projected. The vocalization in the back-_
ground hits decibels and tones that are high enough
to cause audience members to cover their ears.

Next is the strange retelling, of “Jack and the
Beanstalk.” The movements throughout this piece
are frantic, yet stylized enough to evoke go—go danc-
ing patterns. Then, a group of slow, hypnotic
dancers introduce a romantic section, tainted by
self-destruction and a co-dependent voice-over. It all
seems crazy, nutty and disorganized as the projector
screen ﬂashes words, and the three frolicking, little,
brown bears come back onstage to join the frenzy.
And wait — there’s a fourth bear, following the pre-
vious three with a vacuum to clean up the mess left
behind.

While critics are hesitant to call this type of
medium “dance,” it is indeed a form of creative
expression —— a movement of art.

MemoRandum creatively tackles our fragment-
ed and tangled memories.

This performance unites languid dance move-
ments with a techno—based soundtrack. Dumb Type
introduces a modern form of dance to our conven-
tional theatre experience. . '

Dumb Type in MemoRandum is playing at the
Byham Theater tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.
Discounted tickets are available through Pitt Arts,
located in 929 WPU. '

Pitt looks to solve defensiv puzzle

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Panthers head to Morgantown, W.Va., on
Saturday to avenge a loss that came late in the season last
year to West Virginia.\ -' ,

Pitt has been waiting for this game since the fourth
quarter expired in last year’s game. A banner in the tearn’s
weight room that reads “11-15-03” reminds each Panther
of the importance of this game.

Practice was closed to the media to calm the hype for

I _ the game, and the Panthers play it off as just another game.

“This is the next game, so this is our biggest game,”
free safety Tez Morris said.

This is Pitt’s biggest game to date. There is a lot at
‘stake in this year’s edition of the Backyard Brawl — not

~ _ just bragging rights, but the top spot in the Big East is on

the line. .
The West Virginia team Pitt will see this year is justas

dangerous, if not more so, than last year’s team that won, ,~

24-17, at Heinz Field.

After a rough 1-4 start, the Mountaineers have won
four games in a row, including their own upset of Virginia
Tech in the national spotlight.

In this streak, the Mountaineers averaged 33.25 points
on offense and 18 points given up on defense.

“Nobody, so far, has any answers [for the West
Virginia] defense,” head coach Walt Harris said. '

. Harris spoke of the 3-5-3 base 1 defense that the
Mountaineers run. It involves three down linemen, ﬁve
defensemen undemeath and three men deep. It’s eﬁective
against the pass and has allowed the Mountaineers to inter-
cept 15 passes this year.

West Virginia’s defense is not the only wony for Harris
and the Panthers. The Mountaineers use a spread offense,
and they run it efﬁciently. It’s ‘a type of spread offense that
Pitt saw in its loss to Toledo back on Sept. 20.

The most dangerous
part of their offense, howev-
er, is not the pass, but the
run. West Virginia is averag-
ing 210.7 yards per game,
as compared to its 152.2
passing yards per game. '

Quincy Wﬂson has
1,018 yards and eight touch-
downs on the season. He’s a
fast, powerful running back
who has bowled over sever-
al defensemen standing in
his way, and is just licking’
his chops to get a piece of
Pitt’s defense, which allows
an average of 170 yards per
game and has allowed two
running backs to gain more
than 200 yards in a game.

“He’s going to come
after- us at full throttle,” line-
backer Brian Bennett said
of Wﬂson.

The other offensive

threat for the Mountaineers

is  quarterback Rasheed
Marshall, who sat out the
last game against Boston
College because of a con-
cussion he suffered in a win over Central Florida.

“I’ll never forget the throw he made against us last year
in the second half [of the game], when he faked one of our
players up in the air and threw a strike 40 yards downﬁeld,”
Harris said about Marshall’s touchdown pass, which would
prove to be the decisive score in last year’s game.

Marshall can hurt teams with the fun, but he is not a

upset of the Hokies.

V MEGHAN MILLER/PHOTO EDITOR

Tight end Kris Wilson tries to fight off two Virginia Tech defenders during;Pitt’s

big threat passing the ball. He averages only 133 yards
passing per game and has nine touchdowns.

The Pitt defense has to stick to its assignments and
keep Marshall and Wilson contained. '

“As long as we’re accountable [and] everybody plays
their position, like they’re supposed to, like we practiced,
then we should be all right,” Monis said.

._ For 105 years, West Virginia was Pitt’s
second-biggest football rival.
B“-L»   , and
Penn State I decided to bow

ed since 1893, the “Backyard Brawl”_ took
‘on a new meaning for Pitt fans. . I I
And now that both programs A have
become annual contenders in the Big East
conference, the stakes have been raised a
notch higher. A
Pitt meets West Virginia for the 96th
time this Saturday night at Mountaineer
Field in Morgantown, W. Va. The Panthers
have dominated the all-time series, 58-34-
3, and are 20-12-3 all-time on West

' Virginia’s home turf. But the two schools

have split the last six games, and current

Pitt and West Virginia head coaches Walt
Harris and Rich Rodriguez have stalemated
each other at 1-1. ' A _

I The . ﬁrst meeting between the two
squads ca_me on Oct. .23, 1895, when the
Mountaineers" shut out the Panthers 8-0 to

 1 Victory in the “Backyard

Bra,wl.”,The series was interrupted with the
outbreaks of both World War I and World
War II, but since 1943, the two teams have

met annually,‘ making the rivalry the oldest .
9 among Big East Conference schools.

The game has always been the biggest
of the year for West Virginia fans. The week
leading up to the “Backyard Brawl” is
annually celebrated in Morgantown as “Pitt
Week,”. and legendary West Virginia head
coach Don Nehlen was notorious for cir-
cling the Pitt game on his schedule each
season and giving his players legendary
pep talks when Pitt came to town.

. Virginia’s  p _ 9 V
Rodriguez has made this just as big a game I

In ‘fact, when Nehlen was hired at West
Virginia in 1979, the boosters demanded
only that Nehlen win the Pitt game, saying
that the other 10 didn’t matter. 7‘-

The combination of Penn State’s

absence from the schedule and West
competitiveness

for Walt- Harris. Since last year’s 24-17 loss
in front of'66,73l fairs at Heinz Field; the
Panthers have had a sign in their weight

room that has tomorrow’s date on it, to.

remind them of last year’s setback. In addi-
tion, Harris has closed off Pitt’s practices to
the media this week, in order to sharpen his
tearn’s focus. ' ‘
The current head coaches for both

» squads made big names for themselves

tories. In 1997, Pitt quarterback ‘Pete

Panthers a trip to the Liberty Bowl. The ,

postseason berth was Pitt’s ﬁrst » in eight

Panthers ready to open

RYAN FALOON
Staff Writer

The future is now.
From the time Carl Krauser arrived at
Pitt two years ago, Panther fans fell in love

  . with him, ‘nicknarning him “the future,”

and having high expectations for Krauser
to be the next bright star. .

With the graduation of former point
guard Brandin Knight, the time has ﬁnally
arrived for what Panther fans have been
waiting to see — Krauser will take over
the point guard position and bring a new
look to Pitt basketball.

Though Krauser has big shoes to ﬁll,
he’s thrilled about taking over for Knight
and does not let the pressure get to him.

“I’m like Pac-Man,” Krauser said,
laughing. “I like eating up the pressure.”

The Panthers kick off the season with
a new team as well as a new coach tonight
in New York City, taking on Alabama in
the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic at Madison
Square Garden.

This will be the first game for Jamie
Dixon at the head coach position, marking
the beginning of a new era. Though the
Panthers are starting the season earlier than
usual, Dixon feels honored that his team

/
l

131

mu . 2on3  

 season in New York City

was invited to such an elite event and is
excited about his first game.

, “It’s a little early for a start, but our
players deserve this,” Dixon said. “They
weren’t calling us three or four years ago
for this, so I  it’s deﬁnitely a sign of
respect.”

Dixon will have his hands full this
weekend, when he and his team face a very
young but talented Alabama team coached
by Mark Gottfried, who led the Crimson
Tide basketball program in a remarkable
turnaround during his six years there.

The Panthers are young as well,
returning only two starters and adding six
freshmen to the roster. However, the
returning players learned a lot from past
seasons, and remember much success at
Madison Square Garden, where they took
home last year’s Big East Championship
title.

“It means a lot because it’s like our ‘

second home,” Krauser said. “We have
good memories there, so we’d like to keep
it that way.”

Returning to the Panther lineup this
season will bealaron Brown and Julius

" most fantastic come-

” of those passes pulled

Oct. 19, 1970:

Editor's note: This is the 10th in a
“Greatest Games” series that will
appear in The Pitt News the day before
each Pitt football game this year. Each
part in the series will detail Pitt’s
greatest game against that week ’s
opponent and will contain the original
game story as it appeared in The Pitt
News. This story was written by Jerry
Myers on Oct. 19, 1970.

In an unprecedented comeback,
the Pitt Panthers shell shocked the
West Virginia
Mountaineers before
44,479 screaming fans
at Pitt Stadium
Saturday, 36-35.

Erasing a 27-point
Mountaineer lead,
which was recorded in
the first half by a
fired-up WVU squad,
the Panthers exploded
for four big touch-
downs in the last 30
minutes of play to cap. _
what coach ‘Carl ‘ ‘
DePasqua called “the

   
   

back I’ve ever experi-
enced in my 17 years
of coaching.”

With Dave
Havem at the helm,
the Panthers ground
out 259 yards on the
ground, complement.-
ing Havern’s ll-for-
16 passing day. Many

the Panthers out of
third-and—1ong situations, and
Havern’s final completion was the
five—yard pass to Bill Pilconis that put
the Panthers ahead with only 55 sec-
onds left in the game.

— As effective as the offense was, the
defense was the squad of the day. The
defense held the Mountaineers to a
total of 15 plays in the second half,
allowing the offense to grind out 61
plays in that half, seven more than
West Virginia had the entire game.

Summing up the difference
between the two halves defensively,
George Feher, the big middle line-
backer who replaced Ralph Cindrich
early in the second quarter, said,
“Everyone took turns making individ-
ual mistakes in the fist half. In the sec-
ond half, we put it all together.”

The Panthers, now 4-1 on the sea-
son, looked like anything but winners
for the entire first half. West Virginia
moved the ball at will against them,
pilling 351 net yards rushing and five
touchdowns. Ed Williams (106 yards
rushing in the first half) and Bob
Gresham (135 yards, first half) kept
the Panthers on the run. Exploding for

Pitt steals win

long gainer after long gainer, the
Mountaineers appeared unstoppable.

With Sherwood directing trafﬁc,
the Mountaineers cashed in on Pitt pay
dirt four times on the ground and once
in the air. Williams scored on 2-yard
and 1-yard dives followed by
Gresham’s 1—yard skip less than three
minutes later.

Then, with 29 seconds left in the 9

half, Sherwood passed to tight end Jim
Braxton, who sprinted down the mid-

dle for WVU’s fifth and ﬁnal touch-

GREATEST

down of the day.
Pitt’s. lone
score of the first half
came on Denny
Ferris’ 1-yard plunge
into the end zone with
4:21 gone in the sec-
ond quarter. Havem

‘ point conversion run.
Ferris was

game’s’ outstanding
player by the» press,
onlytwo votes -ahead
of Havern in the tally-
ing. Havern was
given the game ball
by the players.

The second
half belonged to the
Panthers. Roaring
back in what fullback

“the best team effort I
have ever seen in my
life,” the Cats pro-
ceeded to_do just what
Duke did to the
Mountaineers one week ago —— they
rammed the ball down WVU’s throat.
Engineering four straight sus-
tained touchdown drives, the Panthers
scored every time they had the ball in
the second half. The Cats took the
opening kickoff of the half and drove
58 yards in 14 plays, culminating with

a Ferris touchdown. Ferris fought for - ‘

144 yards rushing in the contest.

DePasqua managed to rotate his
backs to perfection, allowing Dave
Garnett to get a chance to show his
ability. Garnett charged through the
Mountaineer line for 81 yards, many
of which came on tough third-down
situations.

The team effort rolled on like a big
machine, with Esposito bouncing back
from a very subpar first half to roll up
48 tough yards on the ground. Havem
picked out certain receivers on big-
yardage, third-down situations to keep
the drive moving, while Ferris, Gamett
and Esposito picked apart the
Mountaineer defense.

A last desperation move by the

Greatest Games, page 12

followed with a two-

later named the

Big East title and BCS
berth on the line this year

Backyard Brawl, page 9

lifetime allegiances to earn football schol-
arships.

West Virginia quarterback Rasheed
Marshall is from Pittsburgh’s Hill District,
and Washington, Pa., native Dan Mozes is
a starting offensive lineman for the
Mountaineers. Mozes was passed up by
Pitt in recruiting, and he has expressed his
desire to let the Panthers know what they
missed out on this Saturday.

West Virginia natives have made a big

impact on Pitt’s roster as well; starting
strong safety Tyrone ‘Gilliard and starting
defensive tackle Dan Stephens both hail
from the Mountaineer state.

This year’s “Backyard Brawl” is for
ﬁrst place in the Big East conference and an
inside track on a Bowl Championship
Series berth. And with both schools com-
mitting to the Big East for the long term
despite drastic Atlantic Coast Conference
expansion, the heated Pitt—West Virginia
rivalry should remain unimpeded and grow
in importance for years to come.

had preseason injuries and are not expect-
ed to be 100 percent. ‘Page, who has been
slowly recovering from an ankle injury,
has also been ﬁghting the ﬂu all week.

Also back this season is Toree Morris,
whose outstanding preseason play has
earned him the starting job at center.

“I think conditioning has been his
biggest improvement,” Dixon said. ‘_‘Now
he’s getting more minutes and he’s
responding to those.” ‘ ‘

Also playing impressively in the pre-

duced lO points in just 17 minutes in Pitt’s

Mountaineers was putting their injured

game to try to halt the Panther

momentum, but the Cats proceeded to
cash in on a Havern—to—Pilconis game-
winning touchdown pass.

The Panthers final drive ate up
over eight minutes of the fourth quar-
ter and characterized the Pitt strategy
that prevailed for the entire half. When
WVU finally did retain possession
with 55 seconds left, its drive was
doused when John Stevens recovered

4 a fumble by Mountaineer Wayne

Porter on the Pitt 36, and one play
later, the,Cats-had their fourth victory
of the year and the fourth in a row.‘

‘There wasn’t too much that
DePasqua could say during a pande-
monious locker room scene.

“We controlled the football and
ended up putting points on the score-
board,” he said. “There’s no use talk-
ing technicalities inia game like that.”

And the final score supports his
assertion. ‘ '
