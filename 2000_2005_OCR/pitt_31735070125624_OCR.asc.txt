Tabula rasa: It was philosopher
John Lockeis depiction of a child at
birth, a blank slate. Lockeis blank slate
acts as a canvas, on which the colors of
each individual is unique life combine to

form the portrait of who and what they
are.

And though freshmen entering Pitt
are far ﬁom blank slates — eiqoeriences
throughout their lives have shaped
each student — their collegiate experi-
ence began a little more than a week I
ago. That ﬁesh start, in most cases,
miles from home ana' high school mem-
ories, begins a chapter that many con-
sider the best years of their lives.

Therefs much to do andmuch to
learn. And two freshmen, who agreed
— somewhat reluctantly —- to open
their lives to the campus community,
will spin that tale over the next eight
months as part of a semi-regular fea-
ture in The Pitt News. From Oakland
parties to sorority rushes, break—ups to
hook—ups, The Pitt News plans to pro-
vide a glimpse into the lives of two

Finding time to study,
party and iron her jeans

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

Five ﬂoors above the Towers patio —
better known as the Ashtray — the three
women spend their days and nights in
Holland Hall studying, watching television
and getting to know each other. Things stay
lively in the small three-person bedroom,
but when there’s a lull in the action, one
ironclad standby reinvigorates the freshmen
women.

“We just yell at people,” she says, indi-
cating the window that opens to students
congregating below. “It works at 2 o’clock
in ﬂie morning when you’re real bored.”

She is Raven Christmas, an 18-year-old
freshman from New Jersey who says her
ﬁrst few days at Pitt — though a major
change from high school life — have been
good ones.

“I didn’t have to study in high school,”
Raven says as she glances at a reading from
her comparative politics class. “I think I just
sucked up to my teachers a lot,”

VV1th 15 credits ranging in focus from
trigonometry to French, Raven says she was
forced to learn how to study in the last week
and a half. Most of her classes, though
intense at times, are going well. In fact, she’s
only unhappy with one.

“I’m really not going to like freshman
studies,” Raven says of the one-credit
optional class designed to- orient ﬁrst-year
students to the University setting. “It seems
pointless.” '

But all work and no play isn’t the way
Raven lives her life. Deceptively ‘quiet at

ﬁrst, she stays up late and has spent parts of .

the last two weekends partying.

Josh Stein, a 19-year-old freshman from Ohio‘

Of worldly journeys,
friendships and dreams

CHARLOTTE TUCKER -
7 * Assistant News Editor

Josh Stein wasn’t impressed with the
tumout at Pitt’s ﬁrst game at Heinz Fiel
on Saturday. . 

Josh, a freshman, is a native of
Columbus, Ohio, home of Ohio State
University and football games with regu-
lar attendance of 60,000.

“I laughed when I was getting my
tickets and I saw that ESPN would be at
one football game this season,” Josh says.
“[Ohio State] is always on ESPN or
CBS.”

A self-effacing guy who likes to party
and who has played music since he could
read, Josh is enjoying his freshman year at
Pitt so far. He says he chose to come here
because Pittsburgh is just the right dis-
tance from home.

Friendly and open, he plays the trurn—
pet, guitar and drums and has already been
part of unstructured jam sessions with
friends he’s met in his residence hall. He
came to Pitt to try something new, leaving
behind parents who divorced when he was
8 years old and an older brother who
attends the University of Cincinnati.

Josh, who plans to major in business

and psychology, is single, courtesy of a

policy reﬁned after a 2 1_/2 year relation-
ship went sour. ’
“She wanted me to stay at home for

, school,” he says. “But I like hemp around

my ankle, not balls and chains.”

Staying in one place isn’t part of Josh’s
personality. He loves to travel, having
spent time in London, Italy, Hawaii,
Mexico and Canada. Most recently he

Pitt asbestos abatements abate for now

P JARED SHELLY
Staff Writer

A year ago, warning signs hung
from the walls of residence halls and
other buildings. “Danger —
Asbestos,” the signs read. “Cancer
and lung disease hazard.”

The signs have since been taken
down. Abatements, the process by
which asbestos is removed from an
area, were completed in Amos,
Bruce, Brackenridge and
McCormick Halls last year, and
work continued through the summer
at numerous other locations.

According to Larry Keller, the
director of environmental health and
safety at Pitt, abatements become
necessary when repairs are being
made to a building.

. “Once things pop up like a door-
way being changed, we test the plas-
ter [for asbestos],” Keller said.
“We’ll then do an abatement if it’s
necessary.”

According to Keller, a private
contractor abated the tunnels under-
neath Schenley Quad and the
William Pitt Union. There, a network
of hallways allows underground
access to numerous buildings.

“It was a large job last year and
part of a continual working at this

problem,” Keller said.

Keller said that no abatements
are planned for the near future
because the buildings are generally
in good condition.

“It’s a continual job and a_ real
challenge for housing,” he said.
“They have been and continue to do
a good job [when abatements are
necessary].”

Laurel Johnson, the resident
director of Holland Hall, said that
the end of scheduled abatements
should allow for the return of
Haunted Holland, a haunted house
that takes place in Holland’s base-
ment. The event, in which Holland



 Pinsaunen

GZIHE

residents create their own haunted
house, was . cancelled last year
because of heavy asbestos removals
in trash rooms and bathrooms.

Keller said that if workers'need
to abate a part of the residence halls
where students would often be, such
as a bathroom or trash room, the stu-
dents living there would be notified.
But,,he said, if that job is done in the
basement of a building, there might
not be signs in the lobby of the
building, but rather near the job
itself.

“The signs will probably be in
the areas that lead to [the abate-
ment],” Keller said. “But any job

will be done under containment and
separated by plastic sheeting.”

Asbestos was a common building
material for builders in the early- to
mid—20th century because of its insu-
lating properties. The material
becomes dangerous only when it has
an outlet for release into the air,
which can happen during renova-
tions or when a building begins to
deteriorate. '

People exposed to high levels of
asbestos can develop a disease
known as asbestosis, a lung thicken-
ing that develops many years after
the person’s contact with asbestos
and is nearly always fatal.

 Possible int‘ern‘ship* '

Finding the furnishings

JACKIE MARTIN
The Pitt News

Pitt students who choose to live in off-
carnpus residences rarely get to move into
furnished rooms. Unlike the students who
move into the University’s residence halls,
they have to ﬁnd and purchase beds,
desks, dressers and other essentials for
their new abodes. -

Finding suitable furniture is a chore in
itself, but having to stay within a college
student’s budget adds a whole new set of
worries.

Off-campus residents have many
choices when it comes to acquiring furni-
ture. The ﬁrst option is to buy new furni-

ture. Buses that run on Fifth and Forbes -

avenues can take students to a Variety of
furniture stores. *

The 57A goes to Penn Center and
Monroeville Mall. There is a Sears locat-
ed in‘Penn Center, and Monroeville Mall
is home to several furniture vendors,
including J .C. Penney.

A J .C. Penney’s ﬂoor lamp and clip-
on lamp sell for $30. This lamp contains
three spotlights that can be adjusted to
point in any direction.

J.C. Penney also has mattresses that
range in price ﬁom $150 to $500. Sealy
makes one of the least expensive mat-
tresses. It’s_ called the Edge and costs
$169.95. .

To cover the mattress, Angel Botti, a
J .C. Penney sales associate, recommends
a Bed in a Bag set because it “comes with
pretty much everything.” The set contains
a sheet set, a bed skirt, a sham and a com-
forter. ABed in a Bag made for a twin bed
sells for $79.99. . A

J .C. Penney also carries a wide vari-

ety of nightstands made of everything

from wood to metal and glass. One that
falls in the lower price range is the

Sweetheart nightstand. It retails for
$99.99.

“With these items m the basket the
total is $379.93.

Another store that offers furniture
similar to that of J .C. Penney’s selection is

Ikea. The estimated cost for a bed, dresser, ,

computer desk, sheet set and ﬂoor lamp is
$406.90.

The price rises drastically when stu-
dents add accessories. The cost of a bed-
side table is typically about $59, but some-
times can be a lot more. Table lamps
range from $10 to $30 or more.

While lkea and J .C. Penney offer a
wide variety of higher quality furniture,
some students might ﬁnd that the cost is
just too high. _

The next choice is to check out a used
furniture store. There are several choices
in the Pittsburgh area. Their names, loca-
tions and phone numbers can be found in
the Pittsburgh yellow pages.

Apple Furniture Rentals on Bigelow
Boulevard near Polish Hill is one of the
used fumiture stores in the Pittsburgh area.

Apple sells a bedroom set for $199
that includes a dresser, mirror, headboard
and two nightstands. ‘ .

While cutting cost comers can save
precious dollars, it’s important to careful-
ly check out any furniture you buy.

"‘I got a futon from a wholesale place A

and I had to put it together without direc-
tions,” said sophomore Dan Levine.

Some students, like freshman Daniel '
_ Robinson, ﬁnd their furniture at garage

sales and auctions, or even in the base-

ments of family friends. Robinson said he ,

Amsterdam
ﬂops, Towers
life suffices

Josh, page 1

spent the summer in Israel touring and
hiking across the country. Though Jewish,
he describes himself as “not very reli-
gious.”

He had plarmed a trip to Amsterdam,
but he didn’t get to go because of ﬁnancial
reasons. When pressed for his reasons for
wanting to travel there, he pauses, chuck-
les, ﬂashes an ambiguous grin.

“I like canals,” he explains.-

In many ways Josh is a typical fresh-
man. Pictures of underwear models and
Radiohead posters adorn the walls of his
Tower B room, and he often joins a group
of friends in the Ashtray for a smoke. His
room is neat, a quality he attributes to his
roommate, but random items are rr1is—
placed. As he ﬂops on the bed he pulls a
tube of toothpaste from under a pillow
and smiles, embarrassed.

‘ Josh didn’t know his roommate when
he moved into the room, but says the two
respect each other.

“He goes to bed earlier than me. I
come in at all hours,” he says. “We have
separate friends, but we get along.”

Typical freshman issues aside, Josh
cannot be so easily pigeonholed.

“I’m a little psychologically unique,”
he says.

He likes playing with words. _

“These dry erase boards that every-
one has on their doors, they crack me up,”
he says. “People will have whole ﬁghtson
them without ever speaking to each
other.” His favorite game is to write an
ambiguous word on someone’s board, just
to give them something to think about. *

_ ’Josh’s favorite word of the moment is

_ - “hamsa.” It has no meaning to him or any-

one else, but the word fascinates  .
“It just sounds cool,” he says.

College classes prove easier than high school life

Raven, page 1

“I’m not as quiet as I seem like I am,”
she offers. T‘wo roommates unanimously
agree, and the room is abuzz with further
testament to Raven’s demeanor.

The three women seem to have known
each other for years, but swear they met
only at the beginning of the semester. Raven
says they “get along perfectly.”

“Except for one of her friends,” she
says, indicating one of the roommates. “I
can’t stand her.”_ Laughter ensues. .

But Raven takes ﬂack as often as she
can dish it out. She boasts about a new iron-
ing board —‘ a full—sized model that stands
on the ﬂoor — to the delight of her two

roommates who begin making fun of her
intensive ironing habits.

“But now my jeans won’t be so wrinkled
anymore,” she says.

“How ‘bout your underwear?” jokes
one roommate. Raven swears she doesn’t
iron what lies beneath.

Through all the ironing, studying and
freshman worrying, Raven says her life has
gotten easier since she moved into Holland
Hall. -

VV1th two half—sisters to take care of,
meals to cook and a dozen high school
activities to attend to, life in New Jersey
wasn’t exactly laid back She’s since decid-
ed that involvement in too many college
activities is nearly impossible and signed up

for a meal plan that eliminates cooking from
her life altogether. .

“Coming here was kind of a break for
me,” she says.

But though she’s wary of over—extend-
ing herself through joining too many orga-
nizations, she does hope to join a sorority.

.“I might want to wait till next year,
because I have to make up my mind in like
two weeks,” she says. “My aunt was in a
sorority, my ﬁiends liked it. It’s something
to do,” she says.

In addition, of course, to attending
classes, studying, meeting friends, doing
laundry, watching television, bonding with
roommates, yelling at random passersby
and ironing jeans.

How not to grace the blotter

Memo to freshmen: Congrats on
being the most academically successful
incoming class this University has ever
seen. We’ve also been impressed so far
by your outgoing nature and interest in
getting involved on campus.

But judging from the Pitt Police
Blotter, these few weeks away from the
parents have left you wandering astray.
It seems that Towers and Towers lobby
have been the hot spots for Pitt police to
pick up underage drinkers. Apparently
those high SAT scores didn’t translate
into too much common sense.

So let The Pitt News clue you in on
how not to ﬁnd your name featured in
the blotter while still getting your
groove on. -

Cool: Safety in numbers.

Uncool: Wandering lost by yourself.

Cool: Keeping the house party
inside the house.

Uncool: Flaunting your open con-
tainer while party hopping in South
Oakland.

Cool: Being an individual.

Uncool: Riding the freshman party
train while looking like a stereotype.
(Girls, forget the glitter and hooker
boots, and guys, say good-bye to the
visors.)

Cool: Mastering ‘Pitt and Port
Authority transportation.

Uncool: Chanting drunkenly on the
bus in the wee hours of the night.

Cool: Using the campus blue lights
in an emergency. .

Uncool: Puking in the yellow box.

Cool: Hanging out with friends in
the Ashtray.

Uncool: Screaming in the Ashtray.

Cool: Hooking up with a hottie. -

Uncool: Not listening when he or
she says “no.”

Cool: Using Van Call to get home.

Uncool: Getting so drunk you can’t
remember how to get home.

Cool: Making informed personal
choices and respecting those of your
house or dormrnates.

Uncool: Getting the sixth, seventh I

and eighth ﬂoors high.

Cool: Looking hot when hitting the
party scene.

Uncool: Impersonating Eminem or
Britney Spears.

Cool: "Being sober enough to get
into the elevator.

Uncool: Urinating in the elevator
(or any other public place for that mat-
ter).

Cool: Helping a friend get home or
help in an emergency. _ I

Uncool: Forgetting your friend at
the party. V

What do Butch Cassidy andtthe

They were all responses that I got
when I told people that I was travel-

Bolivia, one of South America’s
two landlocked countries (the other
being Paraguay), is_ indeed ‘where

Before leaving on Aug. 8 for the
Bolivia Service Learning Program
through the Global Service Center,
what I knew of the country came
mostly from classes on Latin
America. ._

I knew that Bolivia is statistically
the poorest country in South America
-—— a continent not known for wealth
and prosperity.

I also knew that it
holds the world record for
coups. It has had more

independence, and a book

than a month before being
overthrown.

I knew that Bolivia is

So for Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid, Bolivia would
be the perfect place to hide out. Here
is a country that has been cut off in
some ways from the rest of the world.
Even today, looking down over the
Cordillera Real on a ﬂight from
Cochabamba to La Paz, one can see
villages surrounded by mountains
with no roads leading into or out of
them. A A

The times are changing — now
even the small town of Vintohas an
Internet cafe just outside the main
plaza —— but one can still see the
effects of isolation. Because of its
historical lack of contact with the
outside world, the country has devel-
oped its own traditions. For example,

a country notorious for
cocaine production, although not as

much in recent years _as production»

has kicked up in Colombia. I also
knew that much of the coca has been
eradicated in the last four years,
thanks to former President Hugo
Banzer’s administration and its
efforts to cooperate with the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration.
An important note on this is that the
cocaine itself is only produced, not
consumed, there —— Bolivia simply
provides the supply for our demand.

notions about the country, about
Latin America and about the so-
called Third World in general.

~ Signs of poverty are everywhere
— street vendors abound, the only
roads outside of the cities that are
paved are the major ones, beggars
come up to you in plazas and ‘on the
street asking for change, children
swarm whenever they see a “well
dressed” person, offering to shine his
or her shoes for one Boliviano —
about 15 cents.

But yet there is a saying that no
one starvesin Bolivia. Even after for-
mer President Victor Paz
Estenssoro’s market reforms in the
mid-1980s, reforms that attempted to
turn Bolivia into a capitalist, every-
man-for-himself society, people still
look out for each other.

In the bustling market of La
Cancha, a place we visited in the city
of Cochabamba, our group noticed
how vendors ‘watched out for each
other’s market stalls when another
was away. The neighbors _of the

orphanage at which we worked in the

town of Vinto would regularly bring
food for the children.

Frequently I fouhd that I was sur-
prised by how little culture shock I
was experiencing. Before the trip I
had the impression that the country
would be completely different from
the United States, but upon getting
there I realized it wasn’t that differ-

Part of the similarity comes from
modernization even in

out the city. A large part of the simi-
larity also comes from a common his-
tbrical legacy. Hailing from Texas, a

ter of Spanish America, I felt some-
what at home.

After three weeks building an
orphanage, traveling to a rainforest,
spending time in a major city and
even visiting Cuzco and Machu
Picchu, Peru, I didn’t want to leave.

Bolivia is indeed a country that
does fit many of the stereotypes that
people gave me. It is a country that

produces cocaine. It is a country with .

mountains and with poverty. And it is
where Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid ﬂed.
But Bolivia is also a country with
a people who are kind and caring: :
It’s a country of contrasts and
extremes, but it’s also a country of

survivors, people who have made the '

best of what they have.

It’s a country that can bring both
hope and despair. ,

And finally, it’s a country to
which I hope to return one day.

Disappearing act

“Ghost World” criticizes everything
  "’Ghost World”

Directed by Terry Zwigoff

Written by Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes

vi‘r71‘r7i‘r1/2

KEVIN KOU
Contributing Editor

It’s easy to forget what differenti-
ates an individual from everyone
else. A group relates to one another
when they scrutinize others.

But advertising conditions
Americans to believe that it’s health-
ier to give in to conformity. Buy
khakis from the Gap. Drink a cup of
joe at Starbucks. Become another
number in the corporate machine.
“Ghost World” writer and creator
Daniel Clowes fights against these
restraints that contemporary society
creates for itself.

Based on the comic with the
same name, the movie remains true
to the comic. Made by a major stu-
dio, this is one the few teen films that
doesn’t climax at the prom where the
popular boy prefers the “unpopular”
protagonist over the homecoming
queen.

Centered around two girls who
have graduated from high school
with questionable futures, Enid
(Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett
Johansson), this ﬁlm relates and seg-
regates those who don’t fit in_. The
girls have planned to get jobs and
share an apartment, but become dis-
tracted by amusing themselves at the
expense of others.

The girls are also disenchanted
by the bombardment of today’s pop
culture. Cynical Enid can’t hold on to
a job at many franchises. Rebecca,
however, is willing to compromise
and reform to “healthy” living.

Steve Buscemi gives an incredi-
ble performance as Seymour, the
most rounded character of the movie.
He says he’s a guy who “obsessively
collects stuff because he can’t relate
to others.” His collection of nostalgia
and his out-of—print record collection
entice Enid, who connects with this
outsider on many levels.

Thora Birch continues her role as
an outsider from “American Beauty,”
but instead of trying to hide her inse-
curity, as Enid she ﬂaunts it as sar-

casm. When everything she counts
on disappears, she gives in and
decides to go to college. The problem
is that she can’t graduate without a
summer art class.

One aspect that makes “Ghost
World” worthwhile is that it’s a satire
that challenges the system. As
Seymour says, “People still hate each
other. Now they can hide it better.”
This movie is all about showing the
hypocrisy of being politically cor-
rect. Seymour explains to Enid that a
time when racial discrimination was
accepted is better than today because
people now just hide their st-ill-exist-
ing prejudices. When Enid displays a
politically incorrect" piece of artwork
at a student art show, the show’s
attendants misunderstand Enid’s
message and censor her contribution.

Terry Zwigoff is the ideal direc-
tor for “Ghost World.” Zwigoff spent
six years filming his last work
“Crumb” (1994), a documentary
focusing on the underground comic
legend Robert Crumb. With the joint
effort of Clowes, Zwigoff uses the
artistic license that fiction permits.

Rather than the ﬂashy camera
work and editing in most movies out
now, “Ghost World”, remains rather
conservative in its presentation.
Composition and cropping of the
frame has been stressed with figures
ﬁlling the screen, similar to Clowes’

illustrations in the comic. The colors’

are washed out from the warm colors

during the day to ﬂuorescent blue in

a porn shop.

Much like the comic, ﬁctional
brand names, and franchises are min-
imized, like pop art, to lose any emo-
tional meaning they could have.
Andy Warhol would have been
proud.

As witty as it is deep, there has-
n’t been a movie about the faults of
obsessively indulging in a capitalis-
tic society since “Fight Club,” and
without the fighting and the
fascist/communist undertone.

Catch “Ghost World” before it
disappears from theaters.

For those college students having a
hard time adjusting to life in a new city, a
new exhibit at Pittsburgh Filmmakers in
North Oakland may give you the jump-
start of Pittsburgh pride you’ve been look-
ing for. Organized by local artists ‘Rob
Long and Alexi Morrissey, “Faces of
Pittsburgh” makes it possible to. View
thousands of Pittsburgh residents, and
realize how familiar their faces are. .

Long and Morrissey’s project is to

. document the, diversity of the people and

neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. The exhib-
it’s photographs of residents of Pittsburgh
and the surrounding neighbor-
hoods are just the ﬁrst part of a
plan _to document the areas
these people come from,
through photographs and writ-.
ten scenarios. ‘After they have taken
10,000 photographs, they will put the pic-
turesit<5getl1eri‘n77al4bool<, hopefully culmi-
nating 1in_;_a national"-"tour. ‘  A

A map of Pittsburgh is immediately
visibleupon entering‘ the New Gallery. A

long strip of computer paper on the oppo-

site wall‘ lists‘ the names and neighbor-
hoods of all those who have posed for the
project so far. Further in, one encounters
projections of slides displaying a person’s
photograph, name and neighborhood. The
slides are diﬁ“erent sizes and displayed dif-
ferently —— some fade in and out, while
others sharply change, as in at family slide

show. In this way the presentation of the .

photographs makes them‘ seem less for-
mal, more everyday; _ . ‘ ‘

Blow It Out Your Ass
Flipp

Rock Steady/Boxov Records
72:1/2 A

Try to imagine the sound of a group of high school

dropouts who found some instruments and started hitting.

them as if they were musicians. Disappointingly, that’s

what most of Flipp’s new album Blow It Out YourAss! ' -

sounds like.

The album is full of mediocre guitar rifts accompa-
nied by bad vocals, haphazard percussion and an
absence of a bass line. Most of the vocals have been
composed of simple, repetitive lyrics, sung by an out—of-
key singer. The band sounds worse than most of the
shows you went to in junior high.

But the key is in Flipp’s live performances and
music videos.

The band ﬁrst gained notoriety by doing a music
video remake of The Who’s “My Generation” The
audio version of this video can be found at the very end
of the last track on the album. «

Unfortunately in order to get to this song you mus
listen to six minutes of silence, and worse than that you
have to ﬁrst listen to the ﬁrst four minutes of the song
“Whole World’s Sick,” which is the last oﬂicial song on
the album. When “My Generation” kicks in, it’s a sur-
prise to realize the band is covering a classic.

Flipp doesn’t just make a mockery of classic rock
songs, they spit in pop culture’s face, too. At one of the
band’s regular appearances at the popular alternative
music festival Edgefest, they hired ﬁve boy band look-

THE PITT NEWS

 

alikes to go on stage in their places. As the crowd began
to show their disappointment, the four members of Flipp
ran onto the stage and proceeded to “beat up” their
impersonators. «

Perhaps Flipp isn’t such a bad group of guys after
all, just a really bad group of musicians.

Some of the other songs on the album are worth
hearing, though. The third song of the album,
“LaDeDa,” has some good vocals and nice guitar rifts.
The song sounds like the theme music to some cheesy
coming of age movie starring too cool teens rebelling
against  whatever. A '

Another tolerablesong is “Psycho Babble.” It has
some above—average guitar rifts and talented singing that
must have been performed by someone other than lead
singer Brynn Arens. This song is the most original one

. on the album and probably the best.

But listening to the music without accompanying
gimmicks proves tiresome, and as long as Flipp prefer to

' focus on their image, their music will always be a ﬂop.

Short for “emotional,” emo began in the
late ‘80s under the more melodic, post—har -

Spring and ‘Moss Icon, and continued into
the ‘90s by the likes of Still Life and Indian
Summer.

Emo songs maintained the upbeat
tempo and screamed vocals -of hardcore
while the angry lyrics turned more emotion-

Around the same time, the more poppy
sounds of Cap’n Jazz appeared in basement
shows and on turntables. The offspring of
Cap’n Jazz, bands such as Promise Ring,
Joan of Arc, Boy’s Life and Jimmy Eat
World, became what is generally known
today as emo. Emo shifted and blended from
emotional hardcore into pop music with dis-

The newest album in Etta James’
career of almost half a century, Blue
Gardenia proves that jazz is still a very
vibrant form of music in today’s pop—domi—
nated market. Although the album has no
new material, the soul—sweet sound of Etta
James’ full, deep voice gives each song a
new life.

‘Even those unfamiliar with jazz and

. soul music may recognize the 1960 classic

“At Last,” a favorite among Sunday after-

I genius reaches deep
into the song—writing

like “when I let you
closer/I only want
you closer/you rip
my heart right out”

Or better yet, “do
your best/do everything you can/don’t you
worry what their bitter hearts are going to
say” ﬁom “The Middle.”

I know exactly what he’s saying; I was
there too, when I was 12. Upon the third lis-
ten to the album I felt embarrassed that the
band members are older than age 14.

I guess it pays to take one’s own advice
as “Your New Aesthetic” says, “You
better sing while you can/imitate and water
down.”

Jimmy Eat World didn’t waste a single
second or note avoiding doing so. Bleed
American falls a little short of everything one
should consider emo, or even remotely'emo—

Blue Gardenia, however, samples much of

Many of the songs, like “In My

are slow, calm ballads that ﬂow effortlessly
from James’ voice and die musicians back-

The live album is becoming a lost
art. A
There are a handful of artists who

. understand and capitalize on the con-

cept ofchanging an already loved song
and elevating it to something unique.
An experience that will not occur the
next time the song is played. An expe-
rience where the song is no longer a
musical piece, but molded as a
response to the situation and the envi-
ronment.
The song becomes a living entity.
Dan Hicks is one of those elite
artists. In fact he is one of the few who
is better, and actually better live.
When Hicks does a live album,
which is more often than many artists,
he uses the song as a starting point. He
changes lyrics, he improvises riffs, and
he plays off of the audience and intro-
duces songs at a casual level that
teeters on deadpan, but always
exudeslO0 percent cool and comfort.
His wit is evident from the lyrics,
but he can pull it off in monologue and
off-the-cuff responses as well.

One of the great things about his ‘

live albums is that interplay with the
audience as a group. Listening to the
album, you can sense their anticipation

of a punch line, a familiar lyric or mid-

song solo. -
He has the ability to inspire and

encourage crowd to interact, be it

singing along, finishing a verse or ask-
ing questions. All that gets picked up
on the recording.

I Hicks is known for the unique

mixture he created of country, jazz and.

gypsy folk combined with his fun and
character—driven lyrics and backed up
by the Lickettes, a set of female back-
ground .vocalists who add a nostalgic
and harmonic feel ‘to the songs to
which they contribute.

Unlike Beatin’ the Heat, his album
from earlier this year, Alive and
Lickin ’ is not really original Dan Hicks

so much’ as good Dan Hicks. Only four A

of the 13 tracks are new songs, ‘and
Hicks has not really changed his style
in the more than 30 years he’s been
playing (of course, he doesn’t need to,
either).

' Alive and Lickin’ is almost a Dan
Hicks sampler. If you don’t like any of
the tracks on this, then move on and
forget it, because he’s not yourtype.
There is a mix of some of his oldest
material, like I “Where’s the Money”
and “How Can I Miss You When You

,Won’t Go Away,” to the title song from

his last live album, Shootin’ Straight.
He has also included songs from
Beatin’ the Heat such as “The Piano
Has Been Drinkin’” and “My Cello,”
and even a couple new songs.
This is some of the best of what
Hicks does best.
And his delivery is always perfect.

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Coach Antonio Bryant? Last
Saturday, after injuring his ankle,
Bryant became a coach on the side-
lines according to head coach Walt
Harris. With the tutelage of Bryant,
Pitt wide receiver Yogi Roth shined
in his first game as a Panther.

“Coach Bryant in the locker
room after the game commented on
how well [Roth] played because he
prepares,” Harris said. “Yogi and
A.B. are road hotel-mates, and they
have a very good relationship. Yogi
has had a tremendous amount of
impact on our football players.
They love the guy.”

Bryant also has a‘ tremendous
impact on the Panther football
team, but his status for Saturday’s
game against South Florida is ques-
tionable. According. to Harris,-

Bryant won’t play unless he is 100 »

percent healthy.

“I don’t think we should play a
guy unless he is 100 percent,”
Harris said. “The way [Bryant]
plays, he’ll push himself. He’s got
to feel like he is ready to go, but
that’s really up to the doctors and

trainers.”

Even without Bryant in the
game, the Pitt offense scored 31
points against East Tennessee State.

But Harris wasn’t very pleased with V
_ the way- his quarterbacks played,

and he was especially upset with the
Panthers inability to perform on
third down.

“David [Priestley] was 15 for 20
and one of those was a drop, but he
didn’t play like I know he can
play,” Harris said. “We had too
many three and outs. That’s what
we can’t have. We didn’t have one
good third-down conversion at all.”

Harris was thrilled that he stuck
to his game plan and got backup
quarterback Rod Rutherford into
the game, even after Priestley’s 85-
yard touchdown run.

“I want to make sure Rod can
trust me,” Harris said. “Now‘I’ve
got to make sure Rod trusts what

.I’m coaching him to do, and that

comes -with experience.”

“He. got his first completion on
his first play in there Saturday. We
came out there throwing with Rod,
and that was for a reason. We want
our opponents to understand he’s
not in there just to run the ball. He

is not a spot player,” he said.

This Saturday Pitt takes on
South Florida at 1:30 p.m. at Heinz
Field. Harris said South Florida will
be tough, but one person on its spe-
cial teams worries him the most.

“We really have a challenge

because of DeAndre’w Rubin,”
Harris said. “He is such an out-

Let’s start locally with the

Steelers. Out is last year’s opening
day starter, Kent Graham. In is XFL
most valuable player and former
first—round pick Tommy Maddox.
. Keep your fingers crossed that
Kordell Stewart stays injury-free
for one more year. All that’s behind
him is Maddox, who hasn’t played
in the NFL since 1995, and Tee
Martin, who hasn’t played in a
meaningful game since college.

Speaking of guys who haven’t
played in a while, Mark Rypien
makes his return to the NFL in
Indianapolis. Unfortunately, Rypien
will never set foot on the field
because starter Peyton Manning has
never missed a start since joining
the Colts in 1998. . -

Staying close by, the Cleveland
Browns appear to be going the same
directionas the Steelers; First—year
coach Butch Davis traded his only
experienced backup, Ty Detmer, to
Detroit, hoping that the often-
injured Tim Couch can make it
through the season. Last year’s
backup, Doug Pederson, returned to
Green Bay to serve as Brett Favre’s
backup, which usually means he’ll
be holding a clipboard on the side-
lines.

Baltimore revamped the posi-
tion, letting go of starter Trent
Dilfer and backup\Tony Banks" in
favor of former Kansas City Chief
Elvis Grbac and Randall
Cunningham, who spent last year as
Troy Aikmen’s backup in Dallas.

Dilfer, who spent most of train-

ing camp without a team, now calls

Seattle home, playing behind
unproven Matt Hasselback, who
was acquired in a trade with Green
Bay during the off—season. Last
year’s starter in Seattle, Jon Kitna,
is now Cincinnati’s starter by
default. Kitna won the job after
both Akili Smith and Scott Mitchell
were injured during the preseason.
Meanwhile, Banks, who signed
with Dallas to replace Aikmen, is
now a Redskin after the Cowboys
released him in August. Banks will

replaced Germaine by signing

After faltering with second-year
starter Shaun King, Tampa Bay
signed Johnson during the off—sea-
son. The Buccaneers. also brought in
Ryan Leaf to be their third—string
quarterback. But Leaf didn’t pass
Joe Hamilton on the depth chart and
was released.

The Chargers also released Leaf
earlier this year, along with Moses
Moreno and Jim Harbaugh. San
Diego hopes to replace the trio with
Doug Flutie and rookie Drew Brees.

this weekend by releasing Jeff
Lewis, who many expected to

Syracuse tries to avoid 0-3 start

The Orangemen will try for their

Central Florida Saturday at the

Pasqualoni knows it will be no easy
task and that his players will have to

“Central Florida is an awfully

Pasqualoni also added that the

four games       ,.,“‘*‘-"..E..‘;*:§E..2°°2

in tourney  

game of the five—game match, with
Pitt coming up short by just four
points.

Nonetheless, there were kills
aplenty, with Hatlestad registering
16,» Hayden 15, and Puzauskas 13.
Miller got in one kill before tearing
her anterior cruciate ligament dur-
ing the game. Five players had dou-
b1e—digits in digs. B e e r In a n
thought his team adjusted well to
the new rally-scoring‘ format in col-
legiate, where every time the ball
hits the hardwood, it’s a point. He
thought it may even have given his
team an advantage early on.

“Beating Ball State right off the

bat, we were a little bit more com-
fortable with it than the other
teams,” Beerman said of the new
and substantially quicker scoring
format.
‘ “We adjusted well, and it’s
something we like. We’d like to
have that Alabama game back, but
you’ve got to move on.”

The team will do just that when
it travels to the Michigan AllSport
Challenge this weekend in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
