More than $117 million in box-
office receipts, racked up for “The
Passion of the Christ” over" the
course of its opening five days,
show that a lot of people walked into
movie theaters to‘ see the Mel
Gibson film. ~

But the story they are walking
out with has been loudly contested,
and critics, religious scholars and
moviegoers are at odds over whether
“The Passion” lives up to the stan-
dard of validsinterpretation.

The film, which portrays the last
hours of the life of Jesus Christ, has
no shortage of detractors. But
despite the harsh reaction to the film
in op-ed columns and film reviews,
viewers filled many theaters to
capacity at the _film’s opening last
Wednesday.

Scores of viewers used tickets
that were reserved, either individu-
ally or through church congrega-
tions, like Pitt’s Roman Catholic
Newman Club.

Pitt undergraduate and Newman
Club _ President Philip Magcalas
praised the film, which he watched
with group members at the Loews
Waterfront Theatre. A I

“I think it’s a message of hope,”
Magcalas said. “It’s the foundation
of what God gave for the world —-‘— I
think that’s hope right there.”

“It should be an interesting
experience for anyone of any reli-
gion,” he said. A

According to Rabbi James
Gibson of Temple Sinai, a Shadyside
synagogue, the large, nontraditional
audience for the film does not neces-
sarily indicate a widespread accep-
tance.

“I think the people who came
with a particular belief walked away
with a validation of their beliefs,”
Rabbi Gibson said.

Rabbi Gibson suggested that
many among those who do not sub-

scribe to the Christian faith__are"”f

questioning the film’s c/gntroversial
content and are concefned about its
“broad /t/o.ucli'e’s” and violent
imagery." A

“Passion” creates hopeand concern

Stopping short of calling direc-
tor and producer Mel_Gibson an
anti—Semite, Rabbi Gibson instead
criticized his sources for the story as
told in the. film’s script, especially

the writings of a »l9th century 9,

Catholic nun‘,m_. Anne ' Catherine
Emmerich. Emmerich’s ecstatic
visions were recorded in the book,

“The Dolorous Passion of Our'Lord

and-Savior Jesus Christ.” ,
“Those I-visions are graphic and

lurid-,” Rabbi Gibson said. “And. her’

visions are anti-Semitic.”

Rabbi Gibson’s comments
echoed those of Anti-Defamation
League National Director Abraham
Foxman, who has restricted most of

his criticism to the film’s interpreta;-r— 

tion of events. 
“Per se, I don’/t/Think that Mel
Gibson is ~ar,1ti»-/S/emitic,” Foxman

said to/the’N’ew Yorker. “I think that

/he-—i"s7 insensitive.” ,
Rebecca Denova, an instructor
in Pitt’s‘ Religious Studies

Department, believes that the story

LAURA J ERPI
Staff Writer

On top of all of the pressuresthat
classes, homework and life in general
bring, having an internship can really_
build up stress.

The students in Robert Gi1bert’s

Advertising’ and Sales Promotion - I "
class do not have to worry about this. _ ‘

They have formed an’ in-house
agency to develop an advertising cam-‘
paign promoting Citibank’s Credit

Education programforstudents. Their T’

agency, which the class named PROS
in MOTION, is made up of . the
approximately 40 juniors and seniors
from the class. ’

“This project will look great on a
resume and is something that future
employers will undoubtedly be inter-
ested in,” said Nicole Leister, who is
in charge of the public relations

department of the agency. “It is giving E

us a lot of real-world experience. Not
only do we get to‘ actually create. and

implement a marketing campaign, but '
we also have to deal with the real--

world complications of time crunches,
approval processes and client rela-
tionships.” 1 - _

Last Wednesday, the students held

’ a video conference call with Vaseem

Baig and Leah Scodras of Citibank.
Baig and Scodras oversee and

do.

The class developed a presenta-

tion to show the progress that they
have made so far. .
Ashley Wingert, the CEO of PROS in
‘MOTION, compared the agency to
that of other schools and said that Pitt
is “setting the bar for everyone else.”
He added that he is proud of his class-
mates’ hard work and success.

Wingert gave the introduction and
an-overview of the presentation.

Passion, page 

of redemption and forgiveness of
sins in»“The Passion of the Christ” is
not valued universally, which may

explain the adverse reactions to the

film. _ V
“Forgiveness assumes guilt. The
idea that Christ died for the sins of
the world is a Christian belief,”
Denova said. « .
Contemporary Christian theolo-
gy has recognized the tension this
worldview creates, ac_cording to
Denova, “and tried to solve the

"problem through Christian-Jewish

relations.”
‘Denova does not want to see the

conversation end’, and to that effect

she is participating in a series of
religious discussions in Pittsburgh,

- one of which will be hosted by Pitt’s

Denova: Christianvalues  
spark different worldview

University Honors College later this
month.

Admirers of the film, like Pitt
undergraduate Jason Hursh, praise
the cinematic realism of “The
Passion of the Christ”. and believe
that concerns about the ,film’s. his-

toricity are misplaced. Hursh, presi- _

dent of Pitt’s chapter of Campus
Crusade for Christ, applauded what
he considered a’ message of evange-
lization. _

“The overall effect of the movie
has people settling back to what they
really believe,” he said. “I think the
truth of the events was played out.”

But, like Denova, Hursh
believes that the film also presents
an opportunity for discussion.

“I believe that, for all faiths, this
is good for getting back to talking,”
he said. ’

EDITORIAL

Reality show mocks Amish culture

A new reality series is in the
works from UPN,‘ and it sets the bar
at a new low.

Tentatively titled “Amish in the
City,” the show’s gimmick places.
Amish teen-agers in an urban setting

and follows them around through"

their culture shock.

Representatives for Amish
groups are up in arms, as well they
should be.

This show represents exploita-
tion and discrimination. It wants to
hold up a people who are different
from those who’ll be consuming the
show for ridicule. The hook of the
show is seeing people in a fish—out—
of-water situation, which can be
funny, but not when it is done in a
spirit of mockery.

The Amish choose to live the
way they do because, to them, it is

" right and proper that they do so.

They aren’t unsophisticated hayseeds
for the rest of society to laugh at.
Their way of life has served them for
centuries. I

They are motivated by their par-
ticular interpretation of the Bible, so
this show amounts to laughing at
those who have chosen a different
religion. Would a show that followed
observant Jews around at a pork bar-
becue make it to television?

The Amish have isolated them-
selves from the ‘rest of society —

they call non-Amish people
“English” -—. to keep free of what
they see as English impiety, and as a

result, they don’t face a lot’ of the.

same problems. This show wants to
take people out of ‘ their sacred
enclave and throw them to the
wolves for cheap laughs at their
expense. ’

The teens who participate in the
show will surely face family and
community repercussions. The Old
Order Amish avoid being pho-
tographed as an interpretation of the
Biblical proscription against making
graven images. Surely these teens
being videotaped and exhibited for
the enjoyment of the English will
draw the ire of some of their older
peers.

Of course, the participants in the
show had to have agreed to do it, but
how could they know what they were
in for? The Amish don’t use electric-
ity and so probably haven’t caught
the last season of “The Simple Life“
and “Who Wants to Marry a
Millionaire?” They probably don’t
realizewhat a vapid and demeaning
genre reality television is. '

It will be nothing short of mirac-
ulous" if this show indeed depicts the
Amish with the “utmost respect and
decency,” as a release from UPN
claimed — let alone if the show is
even remotely good.

I recently attended the
Pittsburgh Auto Show with my
father. As we perused the various
companies’ offerings, I was dis-
tressed to see that several of the
vehicles didnv’t list their miles per
gallon. I had believed that, legally,
a company had to list this sort of
information.

But, much to my surprise, I
found‘ that this is not 4
always the case. Not only
does the government
allow the makers of the
Lincoln Navigator and the
H2, among others, to
choose not to list their gas

And people were crawling all

I have to say that I am disgust-

should expect nothing less from a
culture of wastefulness, where
spending $75 on an Abercrombie

admirable; and bothering to sepa-

too much of a hassle.

Haiti in political upheaval, U.S. policy misguided   

Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western
Hemisphere, finds itself in political upheaval
once more. 1

After 200 years of tyranny, 1990 brought the
first free vote and the first democratically elected
leader to Haiti. Jean—Bertrand Aristide, a slum
priest who speaks seven languages and preaches
nationalism, populism and democracy, was elect-
ed with an astounding 67 percent of the popular
vote. They dubbed him the “Haitian Mandela,”
expressing the hope his election infused into the
country.

Last week, Aristide gave in to international
pressure and violent opposition at home, stepping

down as Haiti’s president. The restoration of hope‘

is long gone and has been replaced by a familiar
sense of despair for the future of a nation with a
sorrowful past.

Eight months after his election in 1990, a mi]-
itary coup overthrew‘Aristide, killing 5,000 peo-
ple before a Clinton-led intervention returned him

V to power in 1994. At the end of his term in 1996,

Aristide peaceably stepped down from his posi-
tion as president, in accordance with the Haitian
constitution. It was the first peaceful transition of
power in Haiti’s history, ‘woven in among 30
coups. -
In’2000, Aristide was once again elected the
president of Haiti. It is here that the legitimacy of
his rule begins to be disputed. Rivals domestical-
ly —— and many of those in international circles -—-

~ contend that the parliamentary elections conduct-

ed that year were fraudulent. While that much
appears certain to an extent, the implications of
this discussion are greatly exaggerated.

Most importantly, the issue does not concern
the legitimacy of Aristide’s own. presidency.
Rather, it surrgunds seven candidates from
Aristide’s\ party who were given Senate seats
though they only won by pluralities —— not the
required majorities ‘stipulated by the constitution.

_puted outcome resulted in

However, theseats did not grant Aristide’s party
the majority of the Senate; — .
it had already held it firm-
ly in grasp. Still, the dis-

the Bush administration
imposing a near embargo
on Haiti and refusing it
$500 million in promised
loans for development and
education —— a death sen-
tence for Aristide and
Haiti both.

Still, this is not a
defense of Aristide. His
rule had become increas-_ T
singly‘ autocratic during his regime and he did not
succeed in raising the economic status of his
country. Maybe it was time for Aristide to go; his
rule had shown itself to be unproductive at the
very least, oppressive at worst. It may have been
time — but not like this. » ~

— Not with the Bush administration effectively
giving a green light to the overthrow of a democ-
ratically elected leader by granting rebels the per-
mission to refuse any political proposal. Not with
hundreds of Marines being dispatched to maintain
peace only after Aristide had stepped down and
left the country — showing Bush’s backing of the
rebels’ efforts. Not if we preach democratic val-
ues; certainly not if we consider who these rebels
are — a series of convicted murderers, butchers
and cocaine dealers—- affectionately deemed
“thugs” by Colin Powell himself. '

Who is to fill this power vacuum? With a
worthless constitution, a nonexistent infrastruc-
ture, and competing rebel factions politically the
strongest, the prospects of a successful Haitian

’ Columnist

democracy certainly do not seem better now that

Aristide has been forced out.
There were other options; Bush could have

done things differently. He could have sent troops
to maintain peace before the current state of chaos
developed, and he could have listened to Powell’s
early calls for a diplomatic solution and exerted
political pressure on the rebels to accept an agree-
ment that would have provided a voice for the
opposition while preserving the Haitian democra-
cy.

Instead, Bush has once again allowed a per-
sonal distaste for another leader to mold his poli-
cy. As president in 1991', George H. W. Bush
watched the first overthrow of Aristide. It was
backed -—- if not actively, at least politically — by
the right wing of American politics because
Aristide’s leftist nationalism was viewed as dan-
gerous, resulting from his relationship with Fidel
Castro and the institution of socialistic policies in
Haiti. .
9 Rather than the embellished impactof fraudu-
lent parliamentary elections, it is these persisting
sentiments among current policymakers within
the Bush administration that have resulted in
refusal of economic aid to Aristide’s regime and
favored -— therefore ensuring —— his removal as
president of Haiti.

Before the election of Aristide in 1990, Haiti
was ruled by the Duvalier family. “Papa Doc” and

his successive son killed 60,000 people during ‘

their 30-year reign of terror. This despotic regime
we both installed and supported throughout its
existence as it served American interests —— the
Duvaliers were resolutely anti-communist.
Aristide is now gone; so what if democracy in
Haiti might be too? After all, it is just Haiti —
who will even remember six months from ‘now?
No one, of course, until the next boats full of

refugees start landing on Florida, that is — and

even then, we will just see which Haitian leader
looks best for us in America.

Starsky & Hutch
Starring: Ben Stiller, Owen
Wilson, Vince Vaughn
Directed by: Todd Phillips
i‘ni‘r

The Cannibals that run Hollywood love

' movies based on long-dead TV shows.

They’re the next safest betsto sequels and
remakes, though they usually suck just as
badly. Anybody remember 2002’s “I Spy”?

“Starsky & Hutch” isn’t exactly bad;
it’s just standard — too much so for
comedic talents Ben Stiller (Starsky),
Owen Wﬂson (Hutch), Vince Vaughn and
Wﬂl Ferrell, all of whom are hung out to
dry by a script. with an embarrassing num-

V ber of bits that never pay off. The audience

at a local preview was unusually quiet dur-
ingmuch of the ﬁlm, which is lightly plot-
ted with an unobtrusive “reluctantly-
paired-cops vs. cocaine kingpin” scenario.

Thank God, the actors break free of the _

mediocrity here and there. Stiller and
Wilson are a natural comic team when
they’re‘ allowed to be; you get -thegfeeling
their funniest moments in the ﬁlm weren’t
in the script Take the scene in which they
attempt to question a cheerleader as she

disrobes in front of them. It’s a stale bit, but
the pair’s banter and facial expressions
make it one of the few memorable scenes
in the ﬁlm.

Ferrell comes out OK, making the
most of his ﬁve or so minutes of screen
time; these days, the man could probably
get laughs reading obituaries. Vaughn, on
the other hand, playing the villain, gets so
little to work with, it’s a crime.

Co-writer/director Todd Phillips is
noticeably constrained by the ﬁlm’s PG-13
rating, which was no doubt insisted on by
the studio. One of the director’s biggest
charms in past ﬁlms (“Road Trip” and “Old
School”) was his penchant for utterly gra-
tuitous foul language and nudity. “Starsky”

“Starsky & Hutch” shold tik t

, proves Phillips is no ftm when he’s behav-

ing. He re-enlists the profane wedding
singer from “Old School,” but for seem-
ingly no reason, since “hard cursing” is out
of the question.

Phillips resorts to hit—and-mostly-rniss
bits -such as a running gag about Starsky
living in the shadow of his cop mother, a
scene in which Huggy Bear’s (Snoop
Dogg) thugs show off their surprisingly
high IQs, a dance contest shamelessly
ripped from Stiller’s own “Zoolander” and

 

the use of music to indicate that Starsky
and Hutch may be gay (“Can’t Smile Carmen Electra to make out, though. I

Fans of the Mavericks, get ready for their makeover

The danger of a group redefining its music is
that people don’t know how to classify them— or
in what genre to place them— if they change too
much. This wastlie fate of the vibrantly innovative
group the Mavericks. ‘ .

After a five-year hiatus, they’re back together
and on tour in support of their sixth album, The
Mavericks. This coming Tuesday, that tour brings
them to the Byham Theater.

After releasing their first album indepen-
dently in 1990, Mavericks signed to the 'pre— '
dominantly country label MCA. The
Mavericks soon outgrew the “country” tag
that went with their music. A blend of Latin,
roots, rock, pop, R&B and Tin Pan Alley
along with country, their music was outside of
what is traditionally played on most radio sta-
tions. Unable to find their niche, the band
members separated and waited for the rest of
the music world to catch up. i

Now, as the Mavericks reappear on the
scene, they do so within a new genre —— rock
‘n’ roll— and on a new label, Sanctuary
Records. Their new sound doesn’t betray the
old Mavericks style of upbeat rhythms,
vibrant melodies and catchy lyrics. The rich
influences gained in the pre—hiatus days
remain and are enhanced upon as well as

applied to songs with more of a rock and pop
sound.

The impetus behind reuniting was Mavericks
front-man Raul Malo, who brought fellow former

band members bassist Robert Reynolds and drum-

mer Eddie Deakin, along with new guitarist Eddie
Perez, together while recording his latest solo
album In My Dreams. The members hadn’t been

too distant from each other. They’ve worked on
several projects together, including a tribute to the
late Johnny Cash. They also have their own ven-
tures, such as Reynolds’ participation in the multi-
band conglomeration group SWAG and Malo’s
work in Los Super Seven along with his well-
received solo career.

If the Mavericks don’t provide enough country,
then you might be able to get
your fill with BR549. This ener-

getic honky—tonk band from
Nashville will be opening for
the Mavericks. The band’s sixth
album, and first containing all
original songs, Tangled Up in
the Pines, goes on sale March 9.

The Mavericks with BR549 will
be appearing at the Byham

p.m. with doors opening at 7
p.m. Tickets are $28.75 in

thing less than extraordinary.
Vocalist Deb Cohen layers her
tenacious Jacob Bannon—esque

Josh bangs the skins for some of the
most ridiculously amazing percus-
sion to date, creating a_ powerful
backdrop with bassist Chris Repko.

melodic than ever before. The CD
itself is very brutal, with tons of
murderous screaming’ and tougher-
than-you playing. However, the
band has always been on the cutting

edge of music and puts together a
show that cannot be competed with.

Their best work really comes
through in their more delicate sec-
tions, however. Deb’s voice carries
the band along, .with' the music
accentuating every breath she takes,
creating a package that is just
absolutely mind—blowing. On previ-
ous works, her scream was toned
down and she let a lot of her
R&B/soul inﬂuence meander
through the recording. On this EP,
however, she demonstrates that she
can scream just as well as the boys.

It focuses more on her no—BS-

singing, which is extremely under-
rated.

At points, you’ll be hearing a
heavy Glassjaw inﬂuence, and it’s
no surprise. The band seems to take

punk rock up for the cabaret

Dresden Dolls
Dresden Dolls

Eight Foot Records
sfriiksik

Strap on your seat belts, kids;
you are in for a wild ride.
Completely unexpected and fantasti-
cally ‘fun, the Dresden Dolls arrive
on the scene. Their sound is almost
like punk music, but not all punk.
Completely original and fun from
start to finish, their self-titled debut
album is a necessity in the collection
of anyone who is completely open to
imaginative punk rock.

Cabaret punk rock? Do these
words go together? I never would

have thought so, until now. With’

heavy piano and drum beats, but
singing like a show_ tune, the
Dresden Dolls manage to make these
worlds collide with the raw fury of
PJ Harvey. Lead singer and pianist
Amanda Palmer can make her voice
be completely frantic and raging and
then take on a calm, smooth and
soothing sound. The combination of
the heavy drum beats and the furious
piano rival many of the piano greats

who helped create rock ‘n’, roll.

The standout on this album is the
second track, “Girl Anachronism.”
You can literally hear and feel
Palmer lose sanity with this fast-
paced song. It’s over before you
realize it started. It leaves you con-
fused and disheveled —— but in a good
way — like a wild Saturday night you
have to piece together the next day.

The tracks “Missed Me” and
“Coin Operated Boy” are sultry and

seductively piano—soaked. It has the A

aftertaste of the songs from the
Musical Chicago.

Their live shows are just as
intense as their music. They sell out
shows all over their Boston home-
town and in New York and beyond.
In the only way possible they can to
show off their music, they dress up
avant-garde and rock out in a cabaret
style for the crowd.

This dynamic duo is way ahead
of its time. They have a cult-like

crowd growing behind them, and’

you can slap some Cabaret make—up
on, because you just may Want to
join them, after a listen.

Not even Bob Marley would turn the lights down low for this concert

coming to Mr. Small’s Theatre this
Saturday.

The smallest venue where Ziggy
and friends will be performing on
their tour, Mr. Smal1’s brings a cozy
atmosphere to Marley’s and
Spearhead’s concert schedule.

Having had Bob Marley as your
father, it can’t be too difficult for
Ziggy to get his name out in the pro-

and R&B.

While you may be familiar with
Ziggy, or at least his father, you may
be less aware of artists Michael

Franti and the members of his band
Spearhead.

Combining the sounds of funk,
hip-hop and soul, Spearhead sings
strong political lyrics about hopes
for a world where racial and social
equality exist.

And the men have rocked the
stage with other genius lyricists,
such as Ani DiFranco, Trey

Anastasio from Phish and Dave
Matthews.

Spearhead came about back in
1994-,-when Michael Franti signed
his new band to Capitol Records.

Michael Franti & Spearhead
have made quite an impression in
the professional music world.
Starting in 1999, trying to get away
from the grasp of big music, Franti
began focusing his lyrics more on

Needless to say, their lyrics pro-

the program in shambles, which is probably the
number one reason why she was shown the door
after five ..years.

0 Berenato’s bunch finished the season with two

[Big East wins, but got those wins with only one

player who even sniffed the ﬂoor last season. Give
Berenato a few years; she’ll turn things around.

0 So much for the theory that Pitt’s men’s bas-
ketball team was slumping at the worst possible

time.‘ The Panthers played-:wh.at: wasquite possibly

rove women’s basketball over time

their best basketball of the season Tuesday night at
Providence. A conference win on the road against
any top-25 opponent is atmajor achievement. But
to blow out the No. 12 team in the country 88-61
on its home court shows that this Pitt team is for

A - real. 

0 Pitt fans would call Tuesday’s win at
Providence a dominant performance by the Pitt
offense. That’s not the way ESPN analyst Jay Bilas
saw things. Bilas said that Chevon Troutman and
Chris Taft’s combined 47 points were a result of
Providence’s worst defensive performance of the
year. ' —

0 Does it really matter if the Panthers win the
Big East Tournament again this year? The stark
reality is that people will only remember this team
for what it does in the NCAA Tournament.

0 Speaking of the NCAA Tournament, who cares‘
if Pitt gets a No. 1 seed? The team has gone onthe
record saying they don’t care. And neither should
anyone else. In all likelihood, St. Joe’s will finish
the season undefeated and be given the No. 1 seed
in the East. Pitt would have a much easier road to
the Final Four as a N o. 2 seed in the East than as a
No. 1 seed in the Mid-west. V A ' __ _

- Pitt’s men’s swimming and diving team just

finished winning its eighth consecutive Big East
title. Does anyone care? I think so. While swim-
ming is obviously not a big spectator sport, most of
the student body and faculty take pride knowing
that Pitt has one of the strongest swimming and
diving programs in thecountry.

0 Another gifted Pitt athlete you may not have
heard of is senior gymnast Alyse Zeffiro. If all
Chris Carter does is catch touchdown passes, then
all Zeffiro does is break school records. Zeffiro
owns the school records for the vault and floor
exercise and is the first Panther ever to win East
Atlantic Gymnastics League specialist of the week
honors on multiple occasions.

Many are wondering if Pitt’s baseball team will
break the 36-win plateau this season. The answer is
yes. It looks like Nick Evangelista has picked up
where he left off last year. And if P.J. Hiser stays
healthy, the Panthers should definitely win more
games than last year  as long as this Pittsburgh
weather cooperates.

Wrestling looks to excel t EWL Championships

ALAN SMODIC
Staff Writer

After a strong regular season, which
saw the team ﬁnish third in the Eastern

Wrestling League, Pitt looks to send as 1

many wrestlers as it can to the NCAA
Championships.

Pitt’s wrestlers will travel to
Bloomsburg, W.Va., this weekend to
compete in the EWL Championships.
There are 37 wrestlers from the EWL
who will qualify to advance, including
the top three in each weight class and
seven wi1d—card berths.

“I always tell my guys to never
depend on the wild card,” head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “Just go out and
ﬁnish in the top three.”

At 125 pounds, Pitt freshman Drew
Headlee is the man to beat. Headlee (17-
5) rolled through the dual meet season
this year undefeated. Peter Derstine,
from Clarion, is a strong favorite to meet
Headlee in the finals.

“[Headlee’s] the No. 1 seed and he
obviously gets that,” Stottlemyer said.
“He’s had a great year and has beaten
everybody.”

At 133 pounds, David Hoffman of
Virginia Tech looks to be the No. 1 seed
with Edinboro University’s Jacob Gray
right behind him. Pitt’s Mike Ciotti (5-4)

have a legitimate shot at advancing.

Two-time NCAA All-American
Mike Maney from Lock Haven
University aims to take home the EWL
gold at 149 pounds. Mike Torriero from
West Virginia University, however, has a
dual-meet win over Maney and has a
legitimate shot at the title. Pitt freshman
Matt Kocher (27-10) will definitely be
heard from.

“[Kocher] actually took a couple of
losses and didn’t get a chance to wrestle
the number one seed from Lock Haven,”
Stottlemyer said. ‘‘He’ll be right in the
West V1rginia’s Matt Lebe will be
the No. 1 seed at 157 pounds since he has
beaten everyone else, but he is not head
and shoulders above everyone else. Lock
Haven senior CharlieBrenneman is also
capable of grabbing the crown. Pitt’s
Justin Nestor (24-13) is as well. T h e
best 165-pound wrestler in the EWL is
considered to be Edinboro’s Matt King.
King, however, has swapped wins with
Virginia Tech’s Chris Stith and will face
tough competition from the rest of the
ﬁeld, including Pitt’s Zach Doll (18-6),
who has held national ranking during the

digits for the Panthers. Also, Sumpter
averages more than seven rebounds
per game for Villanova.“[Ray’s] got-
ten better and better,” Dixon said.
“He’s really improved his outside
shooting since high ‘school. He’s really

' improved his range. He’s a tough kid -

and he’s been well coached and he

I played at a very good high school pro-

gram.”

Recently Villanova has struggled,
as it has won only one of its last ﬁve
games. In their last loss to Miami, the
Wildcats didn’t score a field goal in
thelast 6:18 of the game. Despite the
scoring drought, Ray recorded, a
career—high seven three-pointers and
finished with a ‘game-high of 27
points.’ ,

However, none of that may matter
as Brown, Page and Morris will look

(to add a victory in their final home

game to their four—year record. Over
the past four years, the class of 2004
has compiled a record of 102-28, mak-
ing them the winningest senior class in
Pitt basketball history.

Brown, Page, and Morris have
been the cornerstones of the transfor-
mation of a basketball program that

was struggling when they arrived and e
now is a national powerhouse regular- '

ly mentioned in the same sentence as
Duke, Stanford and Kentucky. Brown,
Page and‘ Morris are proud of their
achievements and hope what they have
created can be sustained by those they
leave behind. '

“It was fun,” Morris said. “It just_

was fun coming to a program and help-
ing it and just watching it grow into
something good. It’s just been fun.”

This weekend’s game will be tele-
vised on ABC Sports on Saturday, and
tip-off scheduled for 1:30 p.m.

top-10 national ranking, looks like the
strongest EWL 174 pound wrestler this
season. Two guys with a shot at the finals
are Pitt’s Francis Iorﬁdo (23-8) and

‘ Clarion University’s Aaron Wright.

A “Francis, has wrestled pretty well,”
Stottlemyer said. “Hopefully he’ll have
good focus. That’s really important.”

NCAA champion Greg Jones from
West, Virginia leads the Way at 184
pounds, followed by Alex Clemsen of
Edinboro. Jones is undefeated this sea-
son and holds the nation’s number one
ranking. Pitt’s Mike Croyle (10-11) will
take aim at defeating the former charnpi—
on.

1 “Greg Jones is a pretty tough guy.
He’s in a class by himself,” Stottlemyer
said.

In the 197-pound class, it will be
anybody’s title. Each wrestler has beaten
each other throughout the season and it’s

1 hard to say who the No. 1 seed will be,

but Pitt’s Josh Birt (19-8) is a favorite for
it. The other two in the mix will be Matt
Daddino of West Virginia and Joe
Phillips of Cleveland State University.

A Nationally ranked, heavyweights
Russ Davie of Cleveland State and
Edinboro’s Joe Hennis ﬁgure to get the
top two seeds. Pitt’s Travis Shirley (17-
15) will be in the mix as the top two are
very beatable.

“Shirley could easily ﬁght for third,
if not ﬁrst or second,” Stottlemyer said.

The most wrestlers Pitt has sent to
the NCAA Championships in one year is
eight and Pitt has a realistic shot at
exceeding that this year, as well as walk-
ing away as the EWL tournament team
champions. ' ‘

“It’s a crazy tournament. You know
the basketball 64-team tournament in
March? It’s just like that,” Stottlemyer
said. “Crazy things always seem to hap-
