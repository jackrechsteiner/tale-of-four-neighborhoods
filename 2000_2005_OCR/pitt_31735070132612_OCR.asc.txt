The events of Sept. 11, 2001
served to both unite the people of
our nationand tear them apart

a While many people pulled togeth-

er in a time of grieving, others
lashed out at their fellow
Americans. -

In the following ‘weeks and

months, American Muslims
became the targets of hate crimes
across the nation.

In anniversary of Sept. 11,

2001, Donna Pople made the
spontaneous decision, after seeing
a ﬂyer promoting ' the event, to
attend the Islamic Center of
Pittsburgh’s “Growing Stronger
Through Understanding”, pro-
gram, held Thursday night

“I couldn’t think of any better
way to spend today,” she said.

By ‘learning more _ about
Islamic culture, people can make
something positive come out of the
deaths of Sept. 11, 2001, she said.

“People tend to think in
stereotypes,” Pople said, explain-

ing that they lump  Muslims into _

one category.

But -the Muslim community
has members of many diiferent
cultures and races, she said, includ-
ing black and white people.

The Islamic Center set up
“conversation stations,” where
people could learn more about the
Islamic religion. The stations cov-
ered issues such as basic Islamic
religious beliefs, who Muhammad
was and the role of women accord-

of Islam and some common miscon-
ceptions of the religion among non-
Muslims.

He added that, though the media
tends only to focus on Arab
Muslims, there are many different
Muslim groups in the religion.
According to Slater, African-
Americans make up 42 percent of
Muslim Americans, and Islam has

been in the United States since the

Bekir Aksoy, president of the
Golden Generation Foundation, also
spoke during the evening, focusing
on how Sept. 11, 2001 has affected
Islam.

Aksoy began by comparing the
lack" of an open dialogue between
Muslims and non-Muslims after the
attacks to the situation that arose
after the publication of Salman
Rushdie’s “The Satanic Verses.”

“Sept. 11 is so deep that -we can-
not analyze it tonight,” Aksoy said.

Aksoy stopped speaking for a

- moment to honor the attacks’ vic-

tims with a prayer recited in Arabic.

Aksoy also took a moment to
acknowledge the hard work of
Fethullah Gulen. Gulen travels the
world, meeting with top religious
leaders to open up dialogue between
Muslims and members of
world’s other major religions. He
also has written many pieces on
communication between Muslims
and the rest of the world. _

After his speech, the audience
was allowed to ask the speakers

supervisor and two fellow officers in
the attacks, asked how the attacks
had affected the integration of Islam
into American society.

According to Slater, “The people
who are truly most affected are the
children.”

Aksoy answered Strachan with a
personal story.

He and his brother—in-law, Emin
Arslan, were driving at night when

their car broke down, forcing them '

to pull over to the side of the road.
There they waited for about an hour
for help. Finally, a police car pulled

_ The officer asked them what
their problem was. After hearing
their explanation, the officer looked
into the car and saw a book called
“Taliban” by Ahmad Rashid. Aksoy
said the officer then treated the two
with extreme suspicion.

‘_‘I hope and pray to God that this
will be temporary,” Aksoy said. a

Koran hit bestseller list after Sept. 11, but questions remain

Center, page 1

ing to Islam. ,

Posters and brochures were set out as
visuals to provide easy access to knowl-
edge, and Muslims were available at the sta-
tions to answer any additional questions.

For example, one ‘station contained
information on the term “jihad.” The word
translates from the Arabic language to mean
“struggling” or “striving,” not, as is popular
misconception, a “holy war.”

This struggling, according to the infor-
mation provided, can  to an internal

' struggle  one’s self, concerning one’s .

own morals; a struggle to resist external

. pressure to conform to principles contrary

to one’s own; or a defensive ﬁght against
others. .

The term jihad, as well as many others,
has taken on a different meaning after poor
translations of the Koran, Omar Slater, pres—_
ident of the Islamic Council, said.

The Koran is the holy book of ﬂie
Islamic religion, detailing what the angel
J abril —— or Gabriel, in western tradition -
said to Muhammad as‘ a message ﬁom
Allah, the Arabic‘ term for the Judeo-
Christian god. '

Other cultures put their own meaning
into translations of the Koran, Slater said.
The word “kaﬁr,” for example, is often

translated to mean inﬁdel, but it actually '

means ‘ilnbelieverf’ Slater said.

The connotations of the two words are

’ very different, he said.

“The words that people use carry
images and meanings,” he said. “People
take those words to push their agendas.”

To avoid this, Muslims are encouraged
to know Arabic, in order to read the exact
text of ‘the Koran, which has not changed
since its inception. ‘

The Islamic Center holds Arabic lan-
guage classes to teach both Muslims and
non-Muslims.

“A1abic’s suddenly become popular,”
Slater said, noting the increase in non-
Muslims taking the classes. ~

“It’ll get you a good job with the FBI,”
he joked

“We as Muslims need to understand
Christians,” he added. “It behooves us all to
understand where people are coming from
in their religions.” ,

The discussion session held in the base-
ment of the Islamic Center yesterday night
was designed to help people understand
each other, Slater said. , - A

. There seems to have been an increase
in understanding and knowledge of Islam",
according to Domia Thomas, who helped
explain Islam at the event Thomas helped
answer questions of attendees at one of the
conversation stations. .

But Pople, who was just visiting the
center, said she did not have the same
impression. ‘ '

“I think the edge has been taken off the
anger and hatred,” Pople said, adding, “I
don’t think‘ we’re that much farther in
understanding.”

Thomas said that sales of the Koran,
which jumped to the bestseller’s list after
Sept. 11, 2001, signiﬁed that people wanted
to learn more about the religion of Muslims.‘

Slater recommends that_ people who
want to read the Koran to go to

Vamazoncom, and not the Pitt Book Center.

The Book Center, he "said, does not sell
good translations of the Koran. Good trans-
lations include those done by Yusif Ali,
Maulana Maududi and Muhammad Ali,
Slater said. .

Slater encouraged people of all reli-
gions to read the Koran in order to better
understand the culture of others.

“It’s not about pointing ﬁngers,” he
said “It’s about being part of the solution,
and not part of the problem.”

Specter’s bill shows vengeance, not justice

Sen. Arlen Specter, R-PA, wants
stop to terrorism. He introduced a bill
that would allow prosecutors to pursue
the death penalty for any person who
commits a terrorist act resulting in the
death of a US citizen, funds terrorism -or
tampers with national defense, nuclear
or power facilities.

Specter’s desire to end terrorism is
understandable. But applying the death
penalty to a broader range of crimes will
neither deter more fanatical terrorists nor
win the United States approval with the
world community. ‘

Moreover, the broad terms used in
the bill —- scare words like “terrorism”
and “espionage” without discreet defmi-
tions —— would open others, perhaps
innocents, to the possibility of being
convicted and sentenced to death for
crimes that would not otherwise carry
the death penalty.

Specter issued a press release on
Sept. 10 that described the bill and quot-
ed President Bush, who called the bill
“ultimate justice.” Whatever _ justice
incurred would be ultimate, and in cases

.so swayed by emotion, that could lead to

innocent lives lost — Compounding
those lost in Sept. 11, 2001 and other ter-
rorist acts.

We do not need to create more vic-
tims; this war needs no more lives lost.

This is notto say that people who
are tried and found guilty of committing
acts of terror should not be punished to

the fullest extent of the law. But we
should not confuse punishment with
vengeance, with the former giving forth
justice and the latter resulting in the
potential martyrdom of the guilty —
which would not dissuade further terror-
ist actions, and thus defeat the bill’s aim.

The United States has a justice sys-
tem in which the innocent remain inno-
cent unless proven otherwise. Lengthy
appeals processes and other safeguards
against wrongful conviction should not
be prematurely terminated by the death
penalty’s ﬁnality. ~

Further complicating matters, the
bill could. be paired with a Specter-
authored law, the Terrorist Prosecution
Act of 1986, which allows suspected ter-
rorists to be extradited from their coun-
tries, tried and put to death here.

The United States has a right to try
crimes committed here in our country.
But trying crimes committed elsewhere,
especially if that elsewhere does not
have the death penalty — and most
developed nations don’t — becomes a

murkier matter.

An ounce of prevention is worth far
more than a pound of ﬂesh, and

‘ Specter’s bill demands far more than

one. Rather than focusing on punish-
ment, Specter and other national leaders
should work to prevent terrorism. And
not angering the rest of the world by
overstepping our judicial bounds would
be a good start.

alumni and staff —
expressed concern and
disappointment yester-
day with our decision
not to dedicate more
of our coverage to the
anniversary of Sept.

clarify that the decision was a con-

nearly inconceivable.

I was very disappointed and
shocked to see that the schedule of
Sept. 11, 2001 anniversary events

about cloning was the top priority.

After Sept. 11, 2001, the
University held numerous events
and ceremonies that were
extremely moving and showed
care and consideration for all the
victims of this tragedy. One event

in particular was the 3,000 ﬂags,

on the Cathedral lawn to com-
memorate all of the victims, and
the ﬂags were specially tied with
blue and gold ribbon to remember

THE PITT NEWS

A time for quiet remembrance

Heller-LaBelle, page 4

photo essay in today’s paper.

This seems to be a year in which
people remember Sept. 11, 2001,
but not make it the dominant part of
their day. .

This is healthy, not disrespect-
ful.

Of course, it would have been
easy to make it the central focus of

our paper; nearly every other paper

did. It is always easier to make
noise than remain silent; and it is
especially difficult to accept that
silence is what is called for.

But we felt silence was called
for —— instead of engaging in mass
mourning, which would have felt

_ false.

It goes without saying that
merely giving lip service to such a
tragedy would have been the great-
est sacrilege imaginable, far less

respectful to the victims than our-

decision not to. .

Perhaps it is worth saying that
newspapers are often more inclined
to focus on the present, to focus on
the actual world left in the wake of
Sept. 11, 2001, whether that con-
cerns terrorism or cloned monkeys.

Still, most journalists are
among the most nostalgic and sym-
pathetic people in the world, and
we, The Pitt ‘News, were far more
concerned with not doing a disser-
vice. to those we wished to remem-
ber than we were with any Student
Government Board meeting or
research study. .

In short, we didn’t think there
was anything left to say that hadn’t
already been said dozens ‘of times
over, so we chose to let everyone
say it for and to themselves.

As a nation, I think we’re ready
to make the transition to memory
instead of memorialization, as diffi-
cult as that may be.

And if we feel, guilty about not
feeling the same sting we did one
year ago, let’s not deny that.

Whether we like it or not, Sept.

11, 2001, is one year farther away,
dulled by time and experience.

, Politics have changed, names
have been recited and honored, and
I know I feel guilty all the time.

Because, when you come right
down to it, there are classes to
attend and blood drive feature pho-
tos to take.

At some point, we came through
the stage where everything about
Sept. 11, 2001 needed to be accom-
panied with loud, universal cries.

Instead, it is now something
that each person takes with him- or
herself, keeps in his or her head as
a reminder of ‘individual lessons
and experiences.

The fact that we all felt some-
thing deep and human on Sept. 11,
2001 does not mean that it needs to
be that same feeling now, just so
long as it’s there and we remember
it. ‘ ‘

How many of us think of Martin
Luther King, Jr. on the holiday
associated with him? How many of
us think of our founding fathers on
Presidents’ Weekend? How" many of
us honor our service workers on
Labor Day?

September 11, 2001 is not about
ceremonies-, trite words or press
photos, and I hope that it never will
be. 4

Rather, I hope that, unlike the
other days, of “significance,” it for-
ever remains a time when we think
about what we’ve lost,,how much
we still have and the people who
die so that we might live just a little
bit longer or a little bit better.

I know it will be for me.

Greg Heller—LaBelle is the Editor in
Chief of The Pitt News, and yester-
day was one of the most moving
days of his life. He ’d like to thank
Shannon McLaughlin and Michelle
Wydra for making him organize his
thoughtslong before he knew they’d
become a column.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 6

Feeding the conversation meter

One of the joys of parking a car on the streets of
Oakland is the walk back to the distant location of your
automobile, to reﬁll the meter so those unforgiving parking
authorities don’t ticket you. '

Sure, it’s armoying to do when it’s cold outside or if the
weather is wet. But, on any other day, it’s nice to get out of
the stuffy conﬁnes of whatever building you’re in, and get
some fresh air and exercise, trying to beat the clock and
pump a bunch of quarters into the parking meter.

Usually, the fresh air and exercise are the only high-

lights of this walk. But on my most recent meter—feeding

excursion from the William Pitt Union, I was struck by two

A small conversations I had on the way to my car, which was

parked comfortably in front of the Phipps Conservatory.

Getting on the elevator with another person on the
fourth ﬂoor, I fell into my usual routine: Press the M but-_
ton, lean against the wall and stare straight ahead.
Somewhere between the third and second ﬂoor, though, the
girl on the elevator said, “No one ever talks in these eleva-
tors.” S .

Somewhat startled, not only by the accuracy of her
statement, but also that someone was actually talking

- I’ve become accustomed to no one talking on the Union’s

sardine—can elevators —-I said, “Yeah, you’re right. Being
in these elevators is like being in an iron lung. Then you
have the pinging as you go from ﬂoor to ﬂoor, which

. sounds like a submarine’s radar. These elevators really

aren’t conducive to conversation.”

She replied with a “Yeah. People just get on these ele-
vators and stare straight ahead.”

By this point, we reached ﬂoor M, the doors opened
and we went on with our lives.

Fast—forward a few minutes. I get to my car and, as I’m

putting thelast quarter in, I hear 0

someone saying “Hey” behind
me. Again startled — I don’t Q ‘

  
 

expect to nm into people I know
over by Phipps —- I turn around,
ﬁrst in the wrong direction to ﬁnd
no one there, then in the other
direction to see a man I don’t rec-
ognize, with a slight smile on his
face. _ P
I say “Hey” back and he
asks if I go to school here.

I say I do. He asks me what
year I’m in, what I’m studying’
and what I hope to do when I get

g . sations in my head a few times. I thought

9 about the iron—lung elevator »-and the ﬁst-

ﬁ "pounding handshake, the conversation

% talking about my unset future plans.

As I got closer to the Union I wondered

- how people could initiate a conversation

with a total stranger so easily; It’s something

I can’t do — I need to be prompted ﬁrst,

after that I can talk and talk. But what those

two people did was something almost

out of school. I tell him I’m a
senior; I’m studying ﬁlm, history

, and a little journalism, and I have no idea what I want to do
when I’m done with school.

After I answer his’ questions, he does that ﬁst-pound
thing that people do in lieu of a handshake, as if to say
“Right on” to my answers. He then asks me again what

year I’m in at school — he thinks I said sophomore, and I

politely say, “No, senior” — before asking what my name
is.
I tell him, and he says, “It’s nice to meet you.”
‘He tells me his name and once again does the ﬁst-
pound thing. ‘ .
He then asks in which direction I’m walking and I
point back toward campus. He says, “Cool, have a nice
day” and does one last, parting ﬁst-pound before walking
toward Schenley Park as I walk back toward the Union.
On the way back from my car, Iran over both conver-

bus with headphones on, never looking in
the direction of anyone, opting instead to
stare into space or burn an invisible hole into the ground.
There are times when you’ll see people talking to others,
but take a look around the 54C or 71A or whatever bus you
ride. VV1th the exception of a vocal minority, no one talks to
anyone else. *

Imagine, however, how much more pleasant a bus ride
or that time before class would be if people talked to one
another. That Union elevator ride went a lot faster, and was
much more pleasant than most of the trips in that pinging
tin can. And the mundane act of feeding a meter was that
much more interesting because of the conversations I had
with these total strangers. _

I’m not advocating becoming ﬁiends with everyone
you meet; that’s ludicrous. Instead, acknowledge the pres-
ence of this other person in the universe with a simple
“Hello” —- it could go a long way if enough people did it.

with it comes another year of shows at

_ through the transition of summer to fall is

a show from the greats known as Cursive,

The members of Cursive made a name

The Blood Brothers, on the other

two-singer attack. They’ve toured with
everyone, and everyone has either. loved or .

Matchstick Men

Starring Nicolas Cage, Sam
Rockwell, Alison Lohman
Directed by Ridley Scott
72r‘L‘n’.‘r

Given Ridley Scott’s penchant for
making action-oriented ﬁlms like “Alien”
and “Black Hawk Down,” it’s morethan
a little strange to see him as the director of
a heist/con artist comedy like
“Matchstick Men.”

It’s not unlike other heist/con movies.
There’s the veteran con artist, Roy Waller
(Nicolas Cage), and his less experienced
partner, Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell),
who pull smal1—time cons despite the
younger partner’s visions of the big score.

In this case, Roy and Frank call peo-
ple up, tell them they’ve won one of three
grand prizes in a contest and, to get
around paying huge taxes on their prize,
convince the people they call to buy
water filtration systems at hundreds of
dollars a piece, when, in reality, they cost
$49.99.

The twist here is that Roy’s a mess.
He goes through various obsessive—com-
pulsive motions —-—. like opening a door
slightly three times, saying “One, two,
three,” before fully opening the door, and
making sure every ﬁber "of his carpet is
perfectly in place —— before leaving his
house. Instead of saying the F-word, he
says “pygmies” over and over again. He
takes mystery pink pills to curb his obses-
sive—compulsive behavior and the various
ticks he has.

After accidentally dropping his pills
down the drain, Roy becomes even more
of a mess and Frank suggests he see a

psychiatrist. Roy begins therapy and, d11r- ‘

ing a period of introspection, decides to
call his eX—wife to see if he has a child —
when she left him she was pregnant -
but he can’t make the call. Roy then gets
his shrink to call and, through him, finds
out he has a daughter named Angela
(Alison Lohman); »

Roy meets his daughter and begins to
loosen up. He even goes along with a plan

Frank has to bilk a wealthy businessman
out of hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and, in the process, shows his daughter a
thing or two about being a con artist.

But this is just the set-up to a bigger,
nastier plot in the ﬁlm, one that must not
be spoiled -4 to do so would be to thwart

the ﬁlm’s ftm and punch — despite its at-

times predictability.
What can be said, though, is that

' Nicolas Cage is a perfect ﬁt in his role -as

Roy, and Scott impressively directs this
ﬁlm, although isn’t action oriented.

‘Cage appears to have a lot of fun with
his role. He doesn’t play Roy’s ticks and
marmerisms for huge laughs. Instead, he

makes them natural, yet they can still be
used for a laugh if need be. Roy is a char-
acter that wins the audience’s sympathy
easily, and Cage upstages the excellent
Sam Rockwell, a. feat not easily accom-
plished.

For Scott’s ﬁrst non-action ﬁlm in a
long time —- perhaps ever — it seems like
he watched “Catch Me if You Can” for
inspiration. The world of “Matchstick
Men” is open and airy, allowing the char-
acters room to grow and exist, rather than
wallow away being two—dimensional.

Scott handles the characters and story
carefully. He knows this ﬁlm is a comedy,
but he never allows it to devolve into

like a little OCD to spark a ﬂame

manic, comedic nonsense. The characters
are normal people, just with quirks, in a
situation that isn’t exactly normal. And
there’s a smooth soundtrack of Sinatra
and jazz that heightens the enjoyment of
the film and makes the connection to
“Catch Me if You Can” that much
stronger.

“Matchstick Men” could have been a
run-of-the-rnill heist/con ﬁlm. But,
thanks to the work of Cage, Rockwell and
Scott, it’s a much more enjoyable ﬁlm
than it would have been in less capable
hands.

Expectations are extremely high for the Pitt foot-
ball team’s performance in the game this Saturday

, when they host Ball State, an unranked, minimally rec-
- ognized opponent from the Mid-Atlantic Conference.

After blowing away Kent State in their season
opener, in front of a crowd of over 56,000, the Panthers

heavily favored over the Cardinals this week. The
crowd may be smaller this week, and little attention
seems to be given by the fans.Many predict Pitt to walk
all over Ball State.

Recent criticism has been aimed at Pitt’s schedule,
which has the Panthers playing three MAC schools in
non-conference games, teams many feelare not worthy
opponents for the Panthers. Pitt head coach Walt
Harris, however, sees things differently. - _ e

“The MAC has knocked off good football teams,”
Harris said. “We know we’ve got an opponent that’s

going to be tough to beat.”

The Cardinals (1-1) are sturdier than they have
been given credit for. They blew awaylndiana State in
their season opener, winning 31-7. Last week, they

, played tough in a 35-7 loss to Missouri, a team that just

missed being ranked in this week’s, polls.‘-

- Ball State has both depth. and experience‘. iniits «

quarterbacksflt is questionable whether senior Andy-
Roesch, ‘who started the second half of last season and
the first two games of this season, will play Saturday.
However, the Cardinals have just as much experience
in backup Talmadge Hill, a ﬁfth-year senior and former
starter who started 23 consecutive games from 2000-

, 2002. ‘

coach Brady Hoke is
still concerned about his

“We haven’t done a

Athletics department needs to schedule stronger teams

The Pitt football team entertains the
dreaded Cardinals of Ball St. this weekend.

Another September weekend, another
MAC opponent »

And when I say MAC, I’m not talking
about pimps or burgers. I’m talking about
football’s anemic Mid—Ame1ican confer-
ence. '

For those of you who don’t know much
about the MAC, it is an association of rela-
tively small, mostly Midwestem schools
that can’t compete ﬁnancially with college
football’s powerhouse conferences, but
have enough support and recruiting clout to
remain in NCAA Division I-A.

Which comes as something of a surprise,
considering that the Panthers have played
seven MAC teams in the last four years.
Pitt is 20-0 against the MAC, which is
presumably why it keeps on inviting those
trembling MAC foes to come to Heinz Field
and get crushed. The only problem with this

ﬁx in 2006. Once the Big East’s two-head-
ed monster of Virginia Tech and Miami
heads south for the warmer waters of the
Atlantic Coast Conference next year, the
Panthers will not be able to get any respect
by strictly playing their conference foes and
a few laughers. Once the BCS contract
expires in 2005, the Panthers’ scheduling

' strategy will directly aifect its national title

hopes.

Pitt can’t keep playing two or three
MAC teams each year. It’s wimpy, it’s bor-
ing and it’s bad business. If the Panthers
really want to get respect as a program, and
not a one-year wonder, they have to play
some tougher non—conference regional
opponents. This would be more interesting
for the fans, so the Pitt athletic department
wouldn’t be forced to sell season tickets for
next-to—nothing to sell out Heinz Field. And

it would be more interesting for the poll-‘

sters, who have the ultimate power in deter-
rriining Pitt’s national title hopes, and who
dropped the Panthers’ one slot in the
Associated Press poll last week despite a
ﬂawless, 40-point victory over Kent State.
Why.not play a hom_e-and-home with
defending national champion Ohio State
each year? The Buckeyes are right next-
door, and their fans travel extremely well.
With both programs on the rise, it would
create a nice, important non—conference

regional rivalry that would garner national

attention

Obviously, once Penn State gets over
itself, the Panthers should renew that rivalry
as well, and they should keep playing tradi-
tional conference foes Virginia Tech and
Miami each year, regardless of any bridges
burned. And if you’re going to play a MAC
team each year, why not play Marshall? The
Thundering Herd are just down the road in

West Virginia, and they recruit great athletes ’

year after year.

Throw in a home-and—home with a
Southeastern Conference team here and
there, and you’ve got a non—conference
schedule that would include teams like

V Miami, Virginia Tech, Marshall, Penn State,

Ohio State, Notre Dame and Georgia, a tra-
ditional bowl rival for the Panthers. That
might sound like a death march on paper,
but the Panthers are going to have to do
something comparable if they want to stay
in the national title hunt when the Big East
looks more like Conference USA in two
years. More importantly, losing to power-
houses each year builds more character,
earns more money and gamers more nation-
al respect then winning nine games against
MAC teams and a weak Big East schedule
each season. ,
It’s great to imagine a day when Pitt

, will play Ohio State to ‘open up its football

season. But until that day comes,‘bring on
ﬂie MAC. ‘

Pitt—Penn State rivalry on hold

Greatest Games, page 9

in the Penn State line and rushed 18 yards for
a ﬁrst down.

On the next play, quarterback John
Turman threw a pass to Rutherford as he cut
across the middle of the ﬁeld.

Rutherford evaded one defender, made
his way up the sideline, then back across the
ﬁeld for a 62-yard touchdown catch as the
Panthers needed just a mere 45 seconds to
complete their scoring drive.

V “I don’t think they were confused,” said
Rutherford _of the Lions defense, which was-
n’t able to come close to him on ﬂie score. “It’s
just that, how are you going to stop it?” 1

Harris praised Turman for his toughness.
Despite being sacked six times, Turman still
amassed 272 passing yards, including 62 of
the most important to Rutherford on the
touchdown play. a

“Turman stood in there and took some
shots ... and when he had some time, he was
delivering the football,” Harris said.

‘The offense struck when we needed to,”
Turman said.

The Panthers failed to complete a two-
point conversion as the ball was intercepted
by Penn State comerback Bruce Branch, leav-
ing the score 9-0 in favor of Pitt.

On the very/ next drive by Penn State, Pitt
defensive end Ryan Smith forced a fumble
with fellow end Joe Conlin recovering the
ball, stopping the Penn State offense in its
tracks.

Late in the third, Penn State tried desper-
ately to get on the board by attempting and
failing to convert a 50-yard ﬁeld goal, which
sailed wide right

With the Pitt defense continuing to stiﬂe
Penn State, Pitt was able to get on the board
again early in the fourth quarter with Lotz hit-
ting a 39-yard ﬁeld goal, raising the score to
12-0 and culminating a drive that was pow-
ered by the rushes of Barlow.

On its ﬁnal possession, the Nittany Lions’

hopes of getting on the scoreboard came up

short as Knight made his presence known one
last time, disrupting a pass that fell incom-
plete.

Turman got the ball and took a knee, run-
ning out the clock

“Last year, we were so close [to beating
Penn State],” Turman said. “We were able to
finish it off this year.”

Pitt ﬁnished with a total of 379 yards,
yielding 225 yards to Penn State. ‘

Barlow led all running backs with 99
yards, while Pitt sophomore wideout Antonio
Bryant led all receivers with 70 yards in the
contest.

With the win, the Panthers improved their
record to 3-0 for the ﬁrst time since 1991 and
will face Rutgers next Saturday at Three
Rivers.

With Penn State’s non-conference sched-
ule ﬁlled up until 2008, that was the last time
the two teams will meet for at least eight years.

At least for the next eight years, Pitt has
the last laugh.
