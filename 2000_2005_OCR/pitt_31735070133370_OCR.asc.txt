Having missed its own Thanksgiving deadline, the
University is now close to finalizing new guidelines governing
vending on Pitt’s campus. '

According to University , spokesman Robert Hill, the
guidelines are “near completion” and the committee’s chair,
Associate Vice Chancellor Eli Shorak, “has enough input and
information from members that he can ﬁnalize the policy.”

The committee met once before Thanksgiving, and a sec-
ond meeting has not been scheduled.

The panel also solicited, recommendations from Pitt
Program Council and some "Student Government Board com-
mittees, prioritizing what types of goods students are interest-

. ed in, SGB President Jeff Alex said.

Though Hill said that the committee is close to a decision,
not all members of the panel were aware of that. When reached
for comment, neither Alex nor Vice Provost of Academic
Affairs and Interim Dean of Students Jack Daniel was aware
that vending rules were close to being ﬁnalized. Both are
members of the committee that was set up to study the issue of

known book is “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.” Look for the story in Thursday’s edition.

In an effort to reach and even

v exceed the goal of $500 million set

at the beginning of Pitt’s capital
campaign, the University has sup-
posedly published a list detailing
the prices to obtain naming rights
for various campus buildings.

‘In a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
article published Nov. 20, the list,
contained in a fund-raising publica-
tion called “The -World of Giving,”

is said to offer up the naming rights_

to campus buildings such as the
Masonic Temple and the University
Library System. ‘

The Cathedral of Learning
though, is off-limits, according to
the article.

“The World of Giving,” accord-

’ ing to University spokesman Robert

Hill, is sent “to donors of the

"University and donor prospects.”

According to the article, the fall
issue of the mailing supposedly
contains the first list that Pitt has
ever made public concerning the
prices to obtain naming rights for
University buildings.

“We’re not selling anything. I’m
not going to discuss that list,” Hill
said. “Naming rights are not sold.” ‘

He added that the naming of
University buildings is honorary,
noting that Wesley W. Posvar Hall
or Litchfield Towers are both
named for former chancellors. ‘

The Katz Graduate School of
Business, though, was named after
Joseph M. Katz, who donated $10
million in 1987. About the naming
of that school Hill said, “That is the

' only example.”

Many of Pitt’s ‘largest donors
are alumni of the University. The
Alumni Association did not return
phone calls regarding whether"‘Thé
World of Giving” was sent en masse
to alumni. , ~

In the year since the start of the
capital campaign, Pitt has raised
$445 million. The campaign is set
to run through June 30, 2003. In the
Post-Gazette article, Carol Carter,
vice chancellor for institutional
advancement, said the University
would like to name at least one col-
lege or school by that date.

Carter refused to comment to
The Pitt News.

‘ The Post-Gazette article report-
ed that the honor of having a med-
ical school personalized is the most
costly, reported at upwards of $100

million. A school of arts and sci-
ences is $50 million, and the list
continues down to sports lockers,
which can be purchased for $2,500.

David Kielman is secretary of
the Scottish Rite, a Masonic temple

' located in Ross Township and a

member of the board that runs the

p new building.’

He said that some of the Masons
had discussed the possible naming
of the campus building. .

“I can’t fathom anyone having a
problem with it,” he said. “If you
came out and named it ‘Pitt’s Little
Whorehouse’  some alumni might
have a problem with that.”

One in four gay or bisexual men

STDs.

“There’s nothing I like to talk
about more than sex,” Sickler said.
“I like teaching people, and this
way people don’t feel like anyone is
talking over them. We have fun
with this.” . ’

Sickler also discussed the effec-
tiveness of different condom
brands. She said Durex and
LifeStyles ranked the most reliable,
with a failure rate of one or two out
of every 100. Trojan_ ranked the
worst, with a _failure rate of four or

Student volunteers   learn with

SUSANNA FORLANO
\ Staff Writer

Charlotte Savage is a 6-year-old girl. She likes
to play with her sisters, read books and watch
“Winnie the Pooh,” but she has gone through much
more than a normal 6-year-old —- Charlotte is autis-
t1C. »
Elizabeth and Kirk Savage first learned of their
daughter’s disability when Charlotte was 3 years
old.

“Her speech and social skills weren’t develop-
ing normally for a 3-year-old,” Kirk Savage said.

-Though Charlotte’s disability was not properly
diagnosed until she was 5 years old, the Savages
did not waste time to help Charlotte improve.
Within six months of her third birthday, Charlotte
underwent an intense learning program.

In order to continue aiding their daughter, the
Savages looked for outside help in the formof vol-
unteers. ,

The Savages made their opportunity known by
asking Pitt’s Student Volunteer Outreach and the
psychology department to advertise their request.
The Savages also have volunteers from other uni-
versities, but most of their helpers are Pitt students.
Right now there are seven volunteers, five of whom
are from Pitt.

Senior Becky Goldman has volunteered for two
semesters. She found out about Charlotte through
the psychology department. ‘ ’

Goldman volunteers because, as a psychology
major, she wants to focus on autistic children.

“Working with Charlotte is different than any. ’

other volunteer opportunity available because this
is one—on-one opposed to a group of autistic, chil-
dren,” Goldman said. “I’ve learned how to read her
body language, and she’s made me much more
comfortable around autistic children.”

Even though the Savages didn’t fully under-
stand Charlotte’s disability, they began a program
they learned from reading the book “Son Rises” by
Barry Neil Kaufman, the father of an autistic child.

After reading the book, Elizabeth Savage trav-

PHoTo COURTESY THE SAVAGE FAMILY

Pitt senior Becky Goldman works with 6-year-old Charlotte Savage, who has autism. Goldman met Savage through
Pitt’s Student Volunteer Outreach program and hopes to use her psychology degree to work with autistic children

eled to Massachusetts to participate in a training
program taught by Kaufman. She learned that vol-
unteers could help in Charlotte’s development.

Kirk Savage said that spending time with an
autistic child and simulating his or her repetitious
acts allows for an environment that is stimulating
and fun. _

“If Charlotte was walking back and forth, we
would do the same,” he said.

In addition to the Son Rises program, the
Savages implemented various techniques from

Growing Minds, a program that focuses on cogni- V

tive development’ and motor -skills. They have

taught Charlotte to count, to match by category and
_to imitate movements nonverbally. ‘ ‘
The Savages said that working with the volun-- '

teers has helped Charlotte develop mentally and
socially. She can communicate what she wants,’ and
is more affectionate and accepting. , .

Kirk Savage said the amount of love and ener-
gy volunteers give to Charlotte is the amount they
receive. ‘

Goldman agreed, adding that she has learned a
lot through her volunteer experience.

“Charlotte has taught me patience and the abil-
ity to be calm in all situations,” she said.

 

Vendors may return   in spring

on-campus vending. «
When asked for more speciﬁcs about when the
guidelines would be‘ ready, Hill "said it is the
University’s hope that “vendors wishing to do busi-
ness on campus will be able to do so in early
spring.” -
The vendor situation became an issue in late

October.- In an Oct. 24 interview, Director of 1

Student Activities Joe Cavalla cited a city ordinance
as the reason vendor contracts were not being
renewed. A week later, Hill atuibuted the policy
change to large contracts the University has with
companies such as PepsiCo Inc. At a Nov. 2 press
conference, I-Iill cited those factors in addition to a
change in leadership within the Office of Student
Affairs, an unspeciﬁed number of complaints about.
vendor merchandise and the aesthetics of the envi-
ronment created by the vendors.

Many vendors were upset about the way in

which they were informed that their contracts were
not being renewed. Dan Fallon, who sold posters in
front of the 'VV1lliam Pitt Union, said he was never
told why he and other vendors would not be
allowed back. Vendors complained that they
received no written notiﬁcation about the decision.

In clarifying some of the forthcoming vending

policies, Hill said that eight spaces will be available.

for use by vendors outside the Union. Vendors will
be subject to an application process that includes a
background check “similar to when someone
applies for a jo ,” and will be required to satisfy
minimum insurance requirements.

In addition,,the vendors must have “uniform,
sturdy and attractive tables and signs.”

Should more than-eight vendors apply for the S‘

available positions, Hill said, “Some judgments will
be made based on how well the vendor is able to
meet student needs. For example, if students want

to buy gloves and the vendor is selling swim trunks,

then we obviously wouldn’t want that.” ~

Alberts wrote that in 1985, ‘Gulf Oil‘ moved from

area.and the University. Chevron.Oil, which acquired
Gulf, had a research facility in Richland and “had no
need for ‘the Gulf research development center in
Harmarville  The center had a replacement value of
$100 million. Pitt proposed that it be given the
research center, pointing out first that the community
would benefit if -the ‘center remained open and second
that Pitt had the array of academic, research, manager-
ial and financial resources to undertake the responsi-
bility of such an operation. Gulf and Chevron agreed to
that proposal. Chevron added a $3 million start-up
grant and the commonwealth offered a $3 million
matching grant for economic development.’.’ ’

University sells self, refuses
to tell students

A year ago, the University kicked off its
capital campaign, designed to raise $500
million. On Nov. 20, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported that it’s already reached
$445 million and that, in order to make the
goal, the University has now released a price
list for naming rights.

For $100 million, the School of
Medicine will become the “[your name]
School of Medicine.” If you’re not as rich,
you, can name the Masonic Temple for $25
million, the'University Honors College for
$20 million or the Music Building for $5
million, among others. Those of still more
modest means can name an athletic locker
for $2,500. V

Although the Cathedral of Learning is

supposedly off-limits, it would not be at all

surprising if that were next. a

As much -as the administration doesn’t
seem to realize this, Pitt is a university, not a
business. It’s one thing to buy naming rights
to a stadium — after all, sports is a business.
Education should not be. _ '

Even the NBA recognized sonre things
are sacred when it prevented the Memphis
Grizzlies from becoming . the Memphis
Express, after Federal Express. Why can’t
the University?

hi the past, buildings have been named
for individuals who leave their legacy at the
University. For instance, Forbes Quadrangle

was renamed in-honor of former Chancellor
Wesley Posvar’s years of service to the
University. In fact, chances are that you’ll be
familiar with many important names from
University history because of current build-
ing names. -

Contributing money is not the same as
contributing hard work and service. Yet the
University is making it the same.

rWhat is even more shady about this is
the way that University officials are trying to
keep this a secret from the student body.
They seem to think we would be unable to
ﬁgure out what happened the ﬁrst day we
walk into the Trojan Cathedral of Leaming
(yes, Dr. Freud, phallic reference intended).

Last week, several oﬂicials told, the
Post—Gazette about‘ this. But this week,
University spokesman Robert Hill contra-
dicted himself when he denied the list’s exis-
tence to The Pitt News. Vice Chancellor for
Institutional Advancement Carol Carter was
candid with the Post—Gazette, yet declined to
comment to The Pitt News.

While many Pitt students do read the
Post—Gazette, its main demographic is the
wider community. The Pitt News is speciﬁ-
cally the student newspaper. By not talking
to The Pitt News, University officials are
once again showing they do not care about
keeping their own students informed and
prefer to operate behind a veil of secrecy.

keys and inanimate objects

I was not surprised to
learn that this ﬁlm and the series of books
that inspired it have caused some contro-
versy. A million different voices raise a bil-
lion different opinions whenever children
and books come together. This is especial-
ly true when the story revolves around
witches and wizards. If nothing else, it is
simply magical how these beings make
would-be censors and book burners come
crawling out of the woodwork.

BBC News reports that a movement to
ban Harry Potter books from library
shelves is still strong in the American
South. Elizabeth Mounce, a parent from
Columbia, S.C., said, “The books have a
serious tone of death, hate, lack of respect
and sheer evil.”

that talk — and it runs perfect- ‘

ly parallel to Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of
the Moon.” If ever a movie was capable of
converting our children to wizardry or
drugs, it was this ﬁlm But for some reason,
Dorothy makes her trek down the yellow
brick road in homes across America every
day without fear of punishment.

Judy Blume, the author of many of the ‘

books you read in elementary school, com-
mented on the Oz books in The New York
Times: “You know what those subversive
tales taught us? That we loved to read! In

those days I used to dream of ﬂying. I may .

have been small and powerless in real life,
but in my imagination I was able to soar.”

It’s a little disappointing that people
are still trying to recklessly ban books.

 

witches, wizards, ﬂying mon-V, 

Apparently we haven’t learned anything
ﬁom the days when “The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn” was branded as racist.

‘ If the trend continues, we will have to take

it all the way and outlaw everything from
the Hardy Boys to Count Chocula.
Unfortunately for the children, every-
thing they do or experience is closely mon-
itored in hopes of ﬁnding a cause to vio-
lence and pain in society. If a kid takes a
gun to school, it must have been the video
games that made him do it. If your daugh-
ter is getting into ﬁghts, you better throw
away her CD collection or make sure she
doesn’t watch PG-13 movies. When that
doesn’t work, maybe you could just spend
more time with_,her. Many parents would
be surprised to learn that taking an active

role in a child’s life is the best way to raise ’

that child right

Harry Potter is the victim in this par-
ticular scenario. He’s not looking to brain-'
wash children or turn them to the dark side.
He’s just trying to ﬁgure himself out and
learn more about the untimely demise of
his parents and the rich legacy of wizardry

that he inherited from them. In that regard, a
‘ maybe there is a little Harry in all of us. _
Many who protest the movie contend

that it farniliarizes kids with paganism.
This is possible, but I wouldn’t start gath-
ering wood for witch burning just yet. Kids
are interested in paranonnal stuff ' like that

because it is food for the imagination —
they don’t put much thought toward the
prospect of dabbling with Satan. .

. Ifyour young son is heading out to see
Harry this weekend, you should be more
concerned for his heart than his soul. The
real danger that the movie presents to little
Trrnmy is found in Hermione, Harry’s _
female companion. If she hasn’t started
breaking hearts yet, she certainly will.
Hermione is smart, adorable and she packs
the most charming British accent. She’s
like an Olsen twin, only not made of plas-
tic and not a robot. Harry Potter will not '
seduce your son in the name of the black
arts, but it might be worse — he may dis-
cover girls.

Give Harry a break. Sure, he’s a wiz-
ard, but he’s a good wizard. You probably
didn’t know that good wizards exist -
especially if you are a basketball fan — but
the movie will assure you otherwise. Do
everyone a favor by not developing a rock
hard opinion on Harry Potter until you’ve
given it a whirl,- and let’s put an end to the
reckless banning of great books and
movies. It has to end now, before Gummi
Bears and Muppets start dropping like
ﬂies.

Tribunals appropriate

In response to David McKenzie’s edito-
rial opposing the Bush administration’s
decision to utilize military tribunals in the
trials of terrorists (“Military tribunals deny
civil rights, principles of the American jus-
tice system,” Nov. 20), I would like to be
blunt and point out that these terrorists are
not American citizens entitled to the same
rights and protections we are.

They have styled themselves soldiers in
a war against the American way of life. As
such, military tribunals are the appropriate

forum for these killers. As Vice President’

Dick ‘Cheney noted, “Those who plot
against our country will not be allowed to
abuse our protections or our freedoms.”

' It defies common sense to apply our
domestic laws_to this situation. Think about
it: To put Osama bin Laden on trial, must
the U.S. soldiers who capture him read him
his Miranda rights? The Constitution -
specifically the Sixth Amendment — also
gives the accused the right to confront his
accusers in court. If the information the
prosecution uses against bin Laden comes
from a source within his organization, to
expose that informant in open court would
be ludicrous. It_ would be tantamount to a
death sentence to that informer and it

would prevent future informers from pre-
senting information to the United States
ever again. ‘

The effect on America’s intelligence
gathering services and our national securi-
ty would be catastrophic‘.

Other problems are presented: Trials
are lengthy events. While bin Laden is on
trial in New, York, what is to stop fellow
terrorists from hijacking airliners to gain
his freedom? The jurors, the judges, the

prosecutors would all be targets for retribu- A

tion,

Further, there is precedent for Bush’s
actions. In June of 1942, a group of eight
German agents lande.d in Florida to engage
in sabotage. They were captured and the
government tried these men in a military
tribunal. The U.S. Supreme Court denied
their appeal; The tribunals were a rare
instance dictated by necessity, and they
hardly tainted the American legal system.

The notion that these terrorists must
have their day is court is promulgated by
liberals with more concern for the form of
justice than its substance. Bush has the
right idea. ' C

we need someone to perform fellatio on Dick Cheney. I know it’s
unpleasant, but that’s the way politics wo .” ‘

A fat man in jeans stands up. He removes his lO—gallon hat and
holds it to his chest, which shows a picture of a Spurting oil derrick
“Aw hell, 'I’ll do it. I’ve been in bed with good ol’ Dick fer years.”

' An awkward silence ﬁlls the room. Neutron Jack ﬁnally says,
“Uh, thank you, Exxon Man. Now second, exploit consumer patri-
otism. Every TV commercial has to display at least one American
ﬂag. And refer to sales promotions as ‘supporting the country.’”

“I have an idea!” shouts Marlboro Man. “Why don’t I change
the name of my company from ‘Phillip Morris’ to “The Altria

Group’ so consumers don’t associate my company with cancer any- ’
' more?” ‘

Neutron Jack says, “Well, that’s not really \what I had in mind,
but sure. This is the time for us all to turn tragedy into opportunity.

We have a Bush in the White House, a war in the East and oil sur- A
veyors in the Arctic. No one cares what we do as long aswe are

‘ﬁghting terrorism.’ Iflohn Ashcroft can void the Constitution, then
surely we can exploit the war a little.”

Suddenly, AOL Man bursts through the door. With a broad
smile on his face, he shouts, “Good news. The stock market soared
on reports that our companies just laid off everyone and that the gov-
emrnent is giving us billions in free money as a reward for our inef-
ﬁciency and ﬁscal inesponsibility.”

The CEO Superfriends suddenly erupt in cheers. Neutron Jack

, says, “Hear that boys '— layoffs and bailouts mean CEO bonuses for _

all of us. Gentlemen, I think we’re going to be all right after all.”

The Man Who Wasn’t There

Starring Billy Bob Thornton and Frances
McDormand

Directed by Joel Coen

Written by Joel and Ethan Coen '
<£n2ri‘r1/2

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

When James M. Cain published “The
Postman Always Rings Twice” in 1934 he creat-
ed a new standard.

It was a type of noir novel that took the
crimes out of the detective’s office and '
police stations, and placed it in the
familial setting. The concept Wasn’t of
solving a crime,‘ the reader learns
“who done it” in the first few chapters, _
this type of crime novel was built upon motiva-
tion, lust and back stabbing. The private eyes
and coppers are a faceless die casting infinite
automatons.

But the criminals were interesting. Sure,
they always lost in the end, but watching them
get there became a new pastime.

Part of the Coen brother’s career aesthetic
surrounds this style. The adulterous couple of
Frances McDormand and John Getz in “Blood
Simple,” and William H. Macy’s bumbling plot-
ter in “Fargo,” stand as classics in the genealogy

of criminal ‘motivation. But in their latest, “The
Man Who Wasn’t There,” they don’t just sample
from that school of writing. They base the plot,
the dialogue and every other facet of production

on the Cain methodology, and then they make it .

their own.

Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is a barber in .

his loquacious brother-in—law’s shop. He talks
only when he has to, and smokes whenever he
can. His wife is sleeping with her boss at the
department store where she works. And for
Crane, today is just the day before tomorrow, an
endless cycle. But then he is confronted with a
business opportunity and for fund-raising, he
decides to blackmail his wife’s lover to get in on

the deal. But instead, the act sets off a series of C

more and more unfortunate actions that never
seem to end. ‘

Black and white photography seems to work
well on a big budget scale about once a decade,
witness “The Last Picture Show,”
“Raging Bull” and “Schindler’s
List.” But Roger Deakins’ work is
perfect. The reminiscent and still
innovative use of shadows and
shades of gray stand to hearken back to noir’s
heyday, while at the same time propelling the
genre forward. . '

The photography is carefully controlled so
that it never dips into the technique of film in
color, reduce to black and white, scratch the film
and talk with static television and local car com/—
mercial attempts at retrospective vintage.

The result is a modern-day noir that both
mimics and pays tribute» to the classics of the
genre, while at the same time adding elements
that are wholly novel.

_ best local bands in the

for a while after Thanksgiving ends, there’s' always a
strange mixture of food in the fridge, and until the leftovers
disappear, meals are sometimes a strange mish-mash of nour-

ishment. Suddenly, mashed‘ potatoes and gravy become accept-—

able breakfast foods, cranberry sauce can double as jam or ice
cream topping andtwho knew turkey was so versatile.

This year, WPTS has planned its own Thanksgiving
Leftovers, a rnish-mash of local bands and musicians and other
acts you might not expect to see perform at the same venue.

A Loud and rocking yet strange and beautiful locals, the
Microwaves ,will clash with the cool and hip beats of Mind

Boxing Alliance. Former members of the

1985, the quirky Microwaves have

released, an EP on ,local record label
Cenotaph. Mind Boxing Alliance has

Locals Pikadori and I0 add to the strangeness" with their
screams and much thrashing about. Pikadori has a reputation as
a great local band that plays energetically and is best catego-
rized as post-hardcore rock ‘n’ roll. Io, comprised totally of Pitt
students, plays intensely, loudly and brutally, with plenty of
screaming. But you can take it.

If the interesting melange of local bands isn’t enough. of a
lure, add inthe Campus Fools juggling brigade. Ever seen
them practicing on cam-
pus? Now see them in
action in between band
sets. '

WPTS. Promotions’
Director Ned Douglass .
said the station has been
planning the "show for
about a month and a half
and relied on the sug-
gestions of WPTS disc
jockeys to choose the

city. The station decided
to ask the Campus Fools
to perform —-— “not to be
corny” — but to break
up the monotony
between sets.

Should you get {a -hankering for a piece of leftover pump-
kin pie, the station has a better offer — "fresh, .free Krispy

And with a Pitt 1]), like all leftovers, these Thanksgiving
Leftovers are free. _ .

Voices in your head

The Calling
Tomorrow, 9 pm.‘
Nick’s Fat City
(41 2) 481 -6880

Modern rock needs a large dose of
originality. From the moment Eddie
Vedder graced us with his presence, rock
bands across America have strived to copy
his every move.

While The Calling may not aspire to
ﬁll Pearl Jam’s shoes, they certainly
attempt to ﬁll the shoes of everyone else
who has ever wanted to be the Seattle
grungesters. Part Creed, part Matchbox
20, The Calling represents everything
mainstream about rock music today.

The Calling is a quintet of guys who
hail from Los Angeles. The band is based
on the friendship of lead vocalist Alex
Band and guitarist Aaron Kamin. The duo
writes all of the group’s songs and went
through many band mates before settling
on the current trio that backs them up.

Pleasant optimism

Fools for the Radio
Mike Plume Band

Steelbelted Records
i’.‘n’.‘r‘£X'

To gain the full effect of Mike Plume Band’s lat-
est album, blast it in an old pick—up truck on a dusty,
southern road. Try to embody the essence of Jerry
McGuire in the scene where he listens to Tom Petty’s
“Free Falling.” Speed. Tap to the beat. Think about
past relationships gone awry. And decide to move on.

Fools for the Radio, Mike Plume Band’s sixth
release, takes modern rock and combines it with
country ﬂair. Folk also greatly inﬂuences the style, as
well as the lyrics. In the tradition of folk music, many

of the songs tell stories.

The CD is an economical investment; no need to
buy several CDs to suit many moods. Have a signif-
icant other? Listen to “DiMaggio” and identify with
the lyrics. Break up with that signiﬁcant other?

°«€iS".i‘<.'t»§€‘¢'z
'~¢€'.‘Q$‘¢("\"“'_.

On The Calling’s ﬁrst release, Camino
Palmero, Band relays drone stories of
heartbreak and lost loves as his four other
band members make noise behind him. _

The album’s opening track
“Unstoppable” has promise. Drums and
guitars break open the track and quickly
fade to reveal Band’s enjoyable but all too
familiar voice.

“Wherever You Will Go,” the album’s
ﬁrst single, is a stale ballad ﬁlled with drab
lyrics like, “Way up high or down low, I’ll
go wherever you will go.”

‘The best track on the album is the
appropriately titled “Nothing’s Changed,”
in which Band states, “The louder that we
scream, the more invisible we seem.”

Anyone who is sick and tired of the
dreary state of rock music should pray that
Band’s statement stands true. They can
scream all they want and faithful rock fans
will ignore them.

But for those rock fans who enjoy the
revival of mainstream alternative music,
the Calling will appear tomorrow night at
Nick’s Fat City.

Going bananas

Deep Banana Blackout
Tomorrow, 7 p.m.

M, $11 in advance, $13 day of
show

(412) 261 -2221

Did you ever wonder what it would
sound like if the Dave Matthews Band and
Stevie Ray Vaughan teamed up to do a
pomo soundtrack? How about a Chi-Chi’s
commercial? Well, fortimately or unfortu-
nately, we’ll probably never know.

In the meantime, the band Deep Banana

Blackout may offer us a sneak peek Their
wild blend of jazz, funk and soul sounds like
it came from a Mexican food commercial or
‘70S adult ﬁ1m-.M2!Y.1’¢.1?Q¢l1:..1!Ei§ 3180 rclia
    
Jameson eating a burrito while praying at
peace rally. Then think of what kind of
music rnightbe playing" in the background.

Founded in 1995, Deep Banana
Blackout have been rockin’ all over the
Northeast for years. They pack a large,
diverse set of musicians with an even wider

 

set of instruments. Ranging from bass to
tuba to congas to “dead insect cocoon rat-
tles,” Deep Banana Blackout have all the
bases covered.

Such a wide selection of sounds and
equipment usually produces an ass—kicking
performance. Think Dave Matthews Band
"and Rusted Root. Combine that with the fact
that they have two live albums, which have
sold a combined 20,000 copies, and you
usually get the recipe for in—person success.

The eight men and women of Deep
Banana Blackout certainly have a few things
to sing about Their lyrics, which include
quite a bit of harmony, are reﬂeclive and
interesting. They describe everything from
Jesus to social change.

They speed up and slow down, but
always «keep it mellow. Lines like
 was  suggest that the Bob

 7-maybe be in
effect. Either way, their psychedelic vibe is
blasting loud and clear — Deep Banana
Blackout just want to have ﬁm. Be prepared
to kickback and let them clear your mind.

This may mean you. have to stop tl1ink—
ing about Jameson and that burrito.

“DiMaggio” will offer solace. The song’s soft guitar Generic-sounding “Walkin’ By” and “Fly in‘ the

chords and sweet lyrics tell the story of a couple Ointment” do a disservice to the rest of the album

compared to Marilyn
Monroe and Joe
DiMaggio. It is up to the
listener to interpret
whether the narrator is
reminiscing about a past
relationship or if he and
his lover are still together.

Despite the reoccur-
ring theme of troubled
relationships, the songs
are pleasantly upbeat.
Tambourines, harmoni-
cas, guitars and a strong
drumbeat give several of
the songs a country sound
minus the twang. Other
songs sound more like
average rock.

But these are the musical duds of the album.

with their ﬂat melodies. On
the other hand, “She’s Still
Everything to Me” and
“Promise Me You’ll Never
Tell” skip along the musi-
cal scale with beautiful,
narrative lyrics and folksy
optimism.

Mike Plume Band
offers a style that is becom-
ing obsolete in the world of
mainstream rock. A bit
bluesy, a bit folksy, full of
optimism and stories, this

. album differs drastically
from the dreary lyrics of
many of today’s depressed
boy-band rockers.

In a good way. -

Humbling hurdle

Sebastopol
Jay Farrar
Artemis Records
vi‘ni‘r1 /2

Experimental is fine, but leave
the failed experiments off the album.

On his new solo album,
Sebastopol, Jay Farrar is afraid_to
part with a few blotched tracks that
taint the rest of the album.

Farrar took the auspicious road
to the top, strumming a six-string
and moaning his woes through a
microphone. His former bands,
Uncle Tupelo and later Son Volt
established Farrar as an important
singer/songwriter for rock and coun-
try fans alike. With commercial suc-
cess and Artemis Records supporting
him, Farrar approached his newest
project with liberated creativity. He
used everything from alternate tun-
ings to a sitar-like steel guitar.

The album proves two things.
The sitar has no place on a Farrar
album, and “stick with what you
know” is a cliche because it’s good
advice.

Sebastopol incorporates too
many unrelated sounds in a musical
style that thrives on simplicity.
Certain Farrar elements shine
through and save the album from
disaster. But too often, Farrar’s
experiments go awry.

A saving grace for Farrar is his
poetic aptitude. The lyrics ﬂow in a
river of images and obscure ideas
that expands into a subtle cry for
attention. Farrar chokes on his
small-town, Midwest pessimism in
“Dead Promises” and “Feed Kill
Chain,” but saves himself from these
dark laments with the other ‘tracks,
which hover near depressed but
avoid any subjects too morbid.

The steady guitar that made
Farrar great is the backbone of
Sebastopol. Unfortunately, certain
extraneous elements hinder the
acoustic ‘timbre; On songs such as
“Feel Free” and “Damaged Son,” the
synthesizers threaten to drown
Farrar’s strumming.

Steven Drozd of Flaming Lips
adds his keyboards toseveral of
Sebastopol’s songs. Despite his
musical talent, Drozd adds unwel-
come ﬂavor to a potentially appetiz-
ing endeavor.

When Farrar reverts to his roots,
the album shines. “Damn Shame”
and “Outside the Door” showcase
the caliber of songwriting that put
the spotlight on Uncle Tupelo eight
years ago.

Sebastopol is a hurdle in the
road to'solo success for Farrar.
Although not his best effort,
Sebastopol suggests that with time
and a more selective" approach,
Farrar’s creativity can take his music
to new levels.

Better off red

For Nearby Stars
VPN

Evil Teen Records
79n1‘r7’.‘r

During World War II, the term “very pleas-
ant neighbor” was a code—phrase used to
describe a group of people coined as “friends of
the communist party.” Bringing back this war-
time moniker, VPN has created a diverse album
full of guitar, piano, synthesizer and even a
Wurlitzer organ.

VPN’s’ second album, For Nearby Stars,
combines their original post—punk sounds with a
bit of melodrama, especially in their lyrics.
Oddly enough, references to war-related terms
and items blanket the lyrics throughout the
album.

' Eerie church bell sounds start off the album
in “Flypaper,” a mellow, distracted song with
lyrics such as “We don’t hide ourselves, from
spies like you.”

Track five, titled “Ten Years from
Tomorrow,” is a slow, serious song that brings
alive the fear of being caught during war. “The
guards are sleeping, we can sneak right in.” And
later “They’re awakening now. Are you in? Are
you out?” The song relies heavily on harmo-

nious vocals to carry the emotion in the song
with only an occasional guitar strum to mark a
chord change.

The awesome harmonies are by far the

band’s strongest point. These harmonies are
intricate and complex, often with multiple vers-
es being sung at the same time, and beautifully
done with the contrast of pitch between the male
and female voices.
_ Maybe their voices work so well together
because they’ve been together for so long. And
not just as a band. Although the group has been
part of the New York scene for almost 10 years,
the three core members of the band are siblings.
Lead singer Austin Hughes joined up with his
twin sisters in the early ‘90s.

In any case, VPN does an excellent job of ’

creating a unique, sound throughout their entire
album, moving from the dragging sound in
“Flypaper” to a pop-funk one in “The Flood.”

A ﬁnal interesting element on For Nearby
Stars is a short, hidden track that starts about
seven minutes in the 11th track, presented in the
form of an answering machine message.

In one of the only‘ comic elements on this

- very serious album, Hughes calls one of his fel-

low band members. As the message relates,
Hughes wanted to go over a “vocal part over the
phone.” He then proceeds to sing the verse in
his best female voice, ending the album.

Booty-bouncin’

Dark Days, Bright Nights
Bubba Sparxxx

Uni/Beat Club

7,“i’7fr‘7i‘r1/2

Ifyou mix a rhyme—slangin’ white boy
with a slow country twang ﬂow from the
backwoods of Georgia with a slew of the
hottest producers in the rap industry, you
are sure to get a genuine head-bangin’ and
booty—bouncin’ hit to bang in your Cadillac
as you ride into the new era of hip—hop
MCS.

Bubba‘ Sparxxx, the newest white boy
to enter the rap arena, emerges with
Tirnbaland’s Beat Club and Organized

Noize in his comer. “Ugly,” the first single ‘

airwaves and clubs. This 'TiInbala‘nd—“pro'—
duced track with an up-tempo, rough-
edged, Middle—Eastem feel is knocking out

everyone who is skeptical about white rap— :

pers and upper cutting all who dismiss
southern l1ip—hop music. _ - .

V Sparxxx was born Warren Anderso
Mathis, the youngest addition to a working

class family of seven in the rural southemr

town of LaGrange, Ga., just 65 miles south
of Atlanta, the hot spot where some south-
ern rap legends have launched their careers.

In an extremely rural area where
neighbors could live a mile or so apart,
Spa1xxx’s closest neighbor was a black kid
whose cousin sent mix tapes down from

 

New York. These-mix tapes were Spa1xxx’s
ﬁrst exposure to rap music, since cable and
urban radio weren’t available in his area.
Far from the rhymes Sparxxx wrote for
battle sessions in his high school gym and
cafeteria, in Dark Days, Bright Nights,
released on Sept. 25, Sparxxx lyrically
transports listeners into the roads of the
rural south from the perspective of a white
boy who grew up broke in “Bubba Talk.”

._.-‘3
‘.3

‘ Listeners will ride shotgun with Sparxxx on A

a’ spiritual journey in "‘Well Water” and
through the not so upscale rural southern
strip clubs in “Betty Betty.”

As long as Sparxxx is blessed with
tight beats and lyrics, he will deﬁantly rise
in the rap game and pave a golden brick
road for more talented white rappers to skip
down.

Bully
Sugarbomb
RCA Records
<£ni‘n2r

Have you ever’ wondered what
Queen would sound like if they were
still around today? Me either. But for
those who actually are wondering, your
wait is over — ‘Sugarbomb have
arrived.

Hailing from Fort Worth, Texas, the
band was formed in 1998 and eventual-
ly signed to RCA records in 2000. The
band’s RCA debut, Bully, is an alt-rock
smorgasbord with songs ranging from
deep orchestral sounds. and harmonies
to infectious pop beats and lyrics.

www.nittnews.cnm

read WBBKBIIII listings every
lfillall. W311 more Slllﬁ than
llI)ll'|I find in the mint edition.

The tracks “What a Drag”, and

“Motor Mouth” sound like the
Barenaked Ladies collaborated with
Queen, and speak of the inevitable
twists and turns that life takes.

The album is full of surprises, set-
ting Sugarbomb and Bully apart from
the other alt—pop acts that seem to turn
up every week on radios throughout the
country. One minute the band is belting
out crowd—pleasing, sing—along
anthems, then they change entirely and
go for a melodic and introspective feel.

Just when you think you figured out
the next logical step Sugarbomb will
take, they change their direction com-
pletely. The title track falls somewhere
between a Weezer and Sonic Youth feel,
while Sugarbomb shamelessly takes a
page from Ben Folds Five in

“Posterchild For Tragedy.”

With songs like "‘Clover” and
“Gone,” we hear a resounding emo
inﬂuence with a heavy emphasis on
their keyboards. These tracks are in
stark contrast to the heavy hitting, gui-
tar immersed “Waiting,” which could
be passed off as a Stone Temple Pilots
song.

“Hello” is deeply inﬂuenced by the
songwriting side of thelband, and could

be compared to Jude. There’s the unex-

pected and out of place song “Mail
Order Girlfriend,” which has an eerie
organ that you might expect to hear on
the carousel of your town fair.

Sweet but not mawkish,
Sugarbomb is sure to have a bright
future

Four down, and one to go.

After starting the season 1-5, Pitt
football won four consecutive games to
even its record at 5-5 after it beat West
Virginia, 23-17.

Now Pitt stands one win away from
becoming bowl eligible, and most likely
earning a spot in the Tangerine Bowl.

On a warm and breezy day at

Mountaineer .Field. Saturday, the’
. Backyard Brawl was all that it was

cracked up to be. There was trash talking
in the stands and on the ﬁeld, hard hits
and lots of eye-opening plays.

Saturday’s key matchup was between
the Bryants: Pitt’s wide receiver Antonio
Bryant vs. West V1rginia’s defensive back
Richard Bryant. During the week before
the Backyard Brawl, the Mountaineers’
Bryant said, “I’ll be the best_Bryant on the
ﬁeld.”

When all was said and done, Pitt’s
Bryant wouldn’t state who he thought
was the better man. He let his play do the
talking.

best Bryant today,” he said after the game.
Pitt’s wideout left little doubt "about
who was the better Bryant on the ﬁeld as

Pitt took a 7-0 ‘lead in the second

halfback option play for the first ‘score of

_Mark Schmidt, in his head-coaching debut for the
Colonials, “knew that_Knight_was a heck of a player.”

' Knight hit six of 12 three-pointers and .c_l_ished--out’

double ﬁgures in all of Pitt’s ﬁrst three games. 

Coach Ben Howland had high praise for his ﬂoor
general. _ '

“Brandin had another great night,” Howland said.
“He’s playing with a lot of confidence.” '

Forward Donatas Zavackas also played well, after
sitting out the Panthers’ ﬁrst two games for violating
NCAA regulations. He hit four of eight from the ﬁeld,
scoring 13 points. , '

The game seemed out of hand at first when the
Panthers (3-0) took a 21-7 lead halfway ‘through the
ﬁrst half while the Colonials went six minutes without
scoring one point. .

But Robert Morris (0!-1) went on an 11-2 run with
5 minutes, 35 seconds left in the half, leaving the

/

Panthers looking confused with the various sets‘ the
Colonials were giving them. . ,

“They gave us a little bit of trouble because of the
different looks,” Knight said. “Especially when they
started to switch defenses.” '

Knight then hit two of his six long-distance shots,
giving the Panthers a 35-24 lead at the half. ‘

The second half . was more up-tempo as the
Panthers outscored Robert Morris 51-38. Knight took
advantage of the fast style of play by hitting three of
ﬁve from behind the arc and shooting ﬁve of seven
from the ﬁeld.

“In the second half I kind of picked it up a little
bit,” Knight said. “I was just taking what the defense
was giving me.”

Pitt shot better than 50 percent from the ﬁeld and
made 35 percent of its shots from three-point territory.

The Panthers also played tough defense, holding
the Colonials to less than 40 percent from the field and
out-rebounding them 39-28.

“We’re playing good team defense,” Howla‘nd.said..

The win was Pitt’s 21st consecutive against Robert
Morris and 51st against Northeast Conference oppo-
nents. ”

For every great athlete or team, there is that one
unlikely adversary that just seems to step up and domi-

adversary has become South Florida.

The next day, the Panthers faced off against Illinois

Pitt’s offense came into the season
without a running back that had seen any
playing time in a collegiate game.

It would be a season of learning for
Pitt’s arsenal of green freshman tailbacks,
but during the tearn’s 10th game of the
season against_West Virginia, the seeds
sprouted._ _ I f V

After three quarters, the game was
knotted at 17 points each. It was the run-
ning of freshman backs Marcus Furman,
Raymond Kirkley and Mike Jemison that
allowed Pitt to march inside the

sions in_the final frame to secure a 23-17 .

After a 16-yard Antonio Bryant

go ahead 23-17.

“Any time you can help your team

As thrilled with the running game as
Harris and his troops were, opposing head
coach Rich Rodriguez was very disgrun-
tled with his teain’s attempts to wrap up
Pitt runners.

“I was very disappointed in our tack-

across the end zone, his right shoe fell off, yet Bryant still
leaped in the air, came down with the ball in hand and
kept his feet in bounds for a Panther touchdown and a
17-14 lead to take into halftime.

Three minutesinto the second half, West Virginia
knotted‘ up the score at 17-17 on a 23-yard-ﬁeld goal by
Brenden Rauh. That would prove to be the only scoring
in the third quarter. .

Tlie_only excitement in the third quarter happened
when referee Penn Wagers turned on his microphone to
tell West Virginia’s band that they couldn’t play when
Pitt’s oifense was set at the line of scrimmage. The
armouncement sparked a loud crowd reaction and two
sacks by the Mountaineers, causing the Panthers to punt.

When the fourth quarter began, the Panthers had a
third and goal from the 6-yard line. Priestley attempted
to go to his tight end VV1lson, but Rick Sherrod broke up
the pass. Pitt settled for a 23-yard ﬁeld goal by Lotz, giv-
ing the Panthers a slim 20-17 lead; «

‘They did an outstanding job all game keeping us
from scoring touchdowns,” Pitt head coach Walt Harris
said. “We kept their fans in the game.”

The Panther defense then forced a three and out by

down caused by a roughing the passer call on the  

Panthers, the Pitt defense tightened up.

Pitt defensive end Bryan Knight stopped Avon
Cobounie after only a 1-yard run. The next two plays
saw the defensive backﬁeld apply perfect coverage, forc-
ing two incomplete passes by Marshall and a West
Virginia punt.

The Panthers started their drive from_their own 11-
yard line and tried to run out the clock. On a second and
10 from the Panthers’ 26-yard line, Furman received the
ball and ran down the left sideline for -44 yards, down to
the Mountaineer 30. Furman rushed for 72 yards on the
‘day and threw a 13-yard touchdown pass.

After three Mike Jemison canies and another recep-
tion by Bryant, the Panthers had a ﬁrst and goal for the
third time inside the 5-yard line. Three times the Panthers
failed to get in the end zone and were faced with a fourth
and goal with only 24 seconds remaining.

Harris called a timeout as the play clock wound
down to one and consulted with his defensive coordina-
tor. When play resumed, the Panthers opted not to kick a
ﬁeld goal and were stopped on the 4-yard line with 18
seconds remaining in the game.

“I went to the defensive coordinator,” Harris said.

unanswered points as part of a 7-2 run in
the ﬁrst 2 1/2 minutes of play.

Illinois State cut Pitt’s lead to seven
points but couldn’t maintain a competi-
tive pace, and Pitt ran away with the vic-
tory, 65-46.

Knight ﬁnished with l3 points, nine
rebounds and ﬁve assists during his 34
minutes of play. Zavackas and Page each
added 11 points for the Panthers.

After the game, Pitt head coach Ben
Howland was impressed with his play-
ers.

“I thought we had a lot of good
efforts tonight, but basically, it was a
team effort,” he said.

Howland also praised Page, who has
emerged as a defensive presence.

“I’m really upset, «because tonight
his guy had two; last night he had zero.
What more can you ask? We’re putting
him on their No. 1 gun each night and
he’s doing a great job,” he said.

Pitt’s two straight wins gave them a
spot in the tournament championship
game. But it wasn’t just any champi-
onship game. This championship game
had “revenge” written allover it.

The only team standing between the

Panthers and asweep of the University

school whose football team, just a few
short months agoidefeated the Panthers
at Heinz Field in what proved to be the

first in a series of disheartening -and .

shocking losses. _

The Panthers stayed competitive
with the Bulls for most of the first half,

Despite the loss, Howland was

pleased with his team’s effort.

» “~We dida good job of handling their
pressure  I feel good about our team
and where we are right now,” Howland
said after the game.

- Knight is eager to put the loss
behind him.
“This one’s gone and we can’t get it

_ back,” Knight said. “We have to work

harder and pick up our intensity on
defense earlier in the game.”
Jackson talked about South Florida’s

continued success against Pitt after the -

game. ‘

“Before we came out here, before
the break, the football team said we’ve
got to beat these guys because they came
out here and beat them. So now I can go

back and say we beat them too,” he ‘said.
