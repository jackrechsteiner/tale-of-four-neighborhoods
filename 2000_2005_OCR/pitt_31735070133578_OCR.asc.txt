The Ballroom of the William‘

Pitt Union was ﬁlled with art and
music courtesy of Pitt ‘students on
Wednesday_ night, when Student
Government _Board’s Multicultural
Committee presented its ﬁrst annual
Pitt Diversity Talent Showcase, an

-event leading up to.the Diversity

Conference on Saturday.

The standing-room-only crowd-
was entertained with acts ranging
from the powerful blues melodies of
Green Tea, and 2 Deep with.Ben“
Geise, to the tap-dancing masteryof~ ‘

Swing Set. Students in an enthusias-
tic crowd bobbed their heads,
clapped‘ their hands, and issued

thunderous applause aftereach per- Y
formance. Green Tea especially _

charmed the audience with her

heartfelt anthem about overcoming C
 a broken heart. ‘ ’

, “Theshowis interesting,” said
senior Ryan Smith, who heard the
show while picking upa newspaper
in the Union and decided to stick

’- around for the performances.

“I’m really impressed. No, make
that very impressed,” Smith said.

During the short intermission,
‘emcee Rob Brown urged the audi-
ence to partake in some refresh-
ments and check out the visual por-

"-*’i’l‘tion‘of theshow. The artwork, while
varying in styles, focused on cele-

brating diversity. Senior Marcy
Foy’s black and white painting of a
-black man, entitled “Justus,” was
one such work. _

Foy said she was inspired by
“the total culture shock of coming to
college i from a closed-minded
town.” ‘ A ' ‘

Current Oakland zoning outdated and wrong, officials say

\

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND

Staff Writer
Oakland’s about to get a
makeover, but it will only be visible

on a map.

City planning commission offi-
cials unveiled a detailed plan
Tuesday to rezone Oakland. But
according to the project’s designers,
the new "zoning designations won’t
affect current land—use so much as the
regulations will be adjusted to reﬂect
the actual shape of the neighborhood.

Bob Reppe, the designer in
charge of the project, said, “[We’re]
trying to match the new zones [with]
what’s there. The idea [behind the
rezoning] is just trying to clear up a
mess that’s been made over the last
40 years and give us abaseline to
work with.”

Zoning regulations restrict the
use to which landlords can put their
property — commercial and residen-
tial — governing everything from
how many people can legally live in a
building to how tall a building can be,
as well as whether a building can be
used as a store or house or for other
uses.

Plans to rezone Oakland have
been in development since 1998,

THE PITT NEWS

when officials decided to re—map the
entire city, neighborhood by neigh-
borhood. At the same time, various
Oakland‘ committees developed the
Oakland Improvement Strategy, a
plan that also called for a re—mapping
of the area to improve‘ the neighbor-
hood and attract more businesses.

Many buildings in Oakland don’t
comply with the "existing zones. For
example, a building may be zoned as
a “single family home” but used as
apartments for students, which would
require it to be classified as “residen—
tial multi—unit.” I

But the re-mapping is not intend-
ed to evict landowners or dramatical-
ly reshape the neighborhood. Reppe
said most zones were determined by
looking at the buildings already in the
area. Provided landowners and home-
owners already have a certificate of
occupancy, Reppe said, their build-
ings’ current status won’t change
under the new zoning designations.

Beyond homes, the new zoning
code will establish boundaries for
institutions such as Pitt and the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. All three Towers, as well as
the Multi-Purpose Academic
Complex, still under construction on
Forbes Avenue, for example, are cur-

rently not in areas zoned as
Medical/Educational Institutes.
-“They ‘are zoned as residential

"buildings and Pitt has legal residency

permits that allow them to be used in
a different manner,” Reppe said-. The
new maps will simply “further legit-
imize the uses that are there right
now.’.’

Reppe said the rezoning will help
solidify Oakland as a neighborhood
and attract new families and busi-
nesses. Drawing a line around Pitt’s
institutional boundaries will “give
people a good idea of where the
University is and the knowledge that
it won’t be able to encroach upon
them.” - '

“There is no magic bullet to clean
up Oakland,” Reppe added, “but
rezoning will allow for businesses
that the current zoning doesn’t.”
Reppe also suggested that rezoning
would help put a halt on absentee
landlords and stop the breaking-up of

‘single—family homes into ‘multi-per-

son dwellings. — -

Other plans called for ‘in the
rezoning‘ plan include allowing build-
ings on Fifth Avenue to be allowed to
be as high as the Iroquois Building:
85 feet. Reppe noted that many build-V
ings are already that tall, because

Thursday, January 31, 2002

they were builtbefore the last zones

4 were enacted.

Also, on the Boulevard of the
Allies, all new construction would
have to be built set back from the
street and landscaping to be, devel-
oped along the roadside. ‘

The meeting Tuesday was the
first in a four-part ‘action to imple-
ment the new zo_ning_ rules. ‘During
the next planning commission meet-
ing, scheduled for Feb. 12, the com-
mission will vote on amendments to
the rezoning plan and “then send the
measure to City Council.

.The City Council must have its
own‘ public hearing on the issue,
where the council wil1'then be able to

Pitt Greeks say they’re working
their image, planning for future

CHRISTINE CLAUS
For The Pitt News

The Interfraternity Council and
the Panhellenic Association are try-
ing to make students across campus
more aware of what is going on in
Greek life.

IFC and Panhellenic Association
are self-governing student groups
that are_ trying to show students all
the different things that fraternities
and sororities have to offer, both
academically and socially.

IFC and Panhellenic Association
govern 17 fraternities. and 12 sorori-
ties, respectively. 2

Tom Calhoun, president of IFC,
said that for most students, joining a
Greek organization is a positive
experience. .

“It can help you out in many
aspects, socially and scholarly,” he

said. “You can make connections
and contacts that cannot be made at
a job fair or otherwise. It can only
affect you positively.”

Calhoun said he got involved in
the Greek system his freshman year
and worked his way to the top
because he wanted to improve the
Greek system. He suggested that
people get to know the different fra-
ternities and sororities. and what
they stand for before they decide

which one they want to rush.

“There is a house for everyone.
To come in and only rush one house
would be cutting themselves short,”
said Calhoun, who is also the presi-
dent of Pi Kappa Phi.

Panhellenic Association
President Jessica Belles feels that
the image of Greeks /on campus
needs to change. .

“We are the largest organization
on campus, and we want to be able
to get more of a positive spin on
Greek life,” she said.

Belles said she joined her soror-
ity because she loved doing commu-
nity service work.

“I found the Greeks and it
became a perfect outlet to get
involved and [find] out what’s going
on iii the University,” she said. “You
can get involved in so many differ-
ent things all through one organiza-
tion.”

“We want to get a positive image
out to everyone instead of all the

coverage on the hazing and drinking A

that happens at a minority of houses,
yet thatseems to be all that makes it
into the news,” Belles said. “We do
dance marathons, blood drives and
charity events along with what each
individual house is doing.”
Educational sessions addressing
issues such as alcohol awareness,
diversity, and AIDS and safe sex are
in the planning stages. Calhoun
explained that these sessions will be
directed at all brothers, not just

- freshmen. -

IFC isalso implementing sever-
al new rules- regarding fraternity
parties. Fraternities will hand out
wristbands at the door to those over
21,‘no_ new guests will be admitted
to parties after 1 a.m., no alcohol
can be served after 1:30 a.m., and
all parties must end by 2 a.m. The
new rules also require parties to

‘keep guest lists to make the.

University aware of who attends
parties. Guest lists must be turned in
to the office of student activities in
the William Pitt Union on Fridays
and returned by the following
Monday.

IFC and Panhellenic Association
will host many events this semester,
including the ‘ Greek God and
Goddess charity event on Feb. 4 at
Club Laga. Each fraternity and
sorority sends a member to compete
in the talent show.

What are they trying to hide?

For eight decades, the executive
branch of the U.S. government has
cooperated with investigations by the
General Accounting Ofﬁce — until now.

Yesterday, the GAO announced that,

. for the first time in its history, it is suing

an administration in federal court.

"According to The New York Times, the

reason for the suit is to compel Vice
President Dick Cheney to turn over doc-
uments concerning the formulation of
his energy plan earlier this year.

The GAO is interested in which
energy company executives participated
in these discussions and what inﬂuence
they had.

The GAO is especially interested in
inﬂuence exerted by the now—infarnous
Enron Corporation. Critics of Cheney’s
plan believe it is overly friendly to ener-
gy corporations.

Cheney and his boss, President
George W. Bush, refuse to turn over the
documents because they believe they are
conﬁdential and that if the GAO was
able to access this information it would
damage their ability to receive “unvar-
nished” advice in the future.

But are they really just trying to hide
something?

As the Watergate scandal unfolded,
the U.S. Supreme Court compelled
President Richard Nixon to release tape
recordings of Oval Ofﬁce conversations.

Nixon’s reason for not handing over
the tapes was national security. He

claimed, perhaps with some reason, that
the release of the tapes could reveal state
secrets.

The content of the tapes — includ-
ing a long silence on one of them — ulti-
mately brought down his administration.

Cheney has a much less valid
excuse than -Nixon did.

These documents concern energy
policy, something with nowhere near the
sensitivity of top-level discussions over
national security.

We mustn’t forget that even with the
latter circumstances, Nixon was still
forced to turn over the tapes.

Thus it stands to reason that Cheney
will eventually be compelled as well.

By dragging his feet —— especially
on something that he will likely eventu-
ally lose —— Cheney is wasting valuable
time that he could spend running the
country. ‘ ' .

One also carmot help wondering
exactly why Cheney refuses to reveal
these documents.

What does he have to hide? Did cor-
porations, especially Enron, exert undue
inﬂuence over the energy plan? ,

White House spokeswoman Claire
Buchan told the Times that the adminis-

7 tration believes “there are important_
principles at stake which we will vigor-

ously defend.”

Is the administration really trying to
defend important principles or is it
merely covering something up?

Seven steps forrecovery
from Steelers’ loss

On Sunday, Jan. 27, the Hindenberg
crashed into downtown Pittsburgh.

A volcano erupted in Point
State Park

Godzilla, King Kong,
Jaws and a giant version of the
kid from the Dell commercial

felt like. Monday’s front page
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
bore the simple headline “The
Steelers Lose.” To many, it

 

David J. McCarthy

Colurrmist

Steelers addict, the habit can be tough to

kick Simply trade one drug for another.

Swap out your “Steelers
crack” for “Penguins smack”
Go see Mario Lemieux ﬁll
the nets. Take out your
aggression by violently
insulting the opposing goalie.

‘ Let’s not forget about Pitt

Panthers are kickin’ Big East
ass. .

‘ If you really need an
additional sports ﬁx, Pirates

held the same signiﬁcance as

“A-Bomb Dropped on Orphanages” or
“Acid Spill Demolishes Nurmery.” It was a
sad state of aifairs for Pittsburghers every-
where.

Now, the rebuilding process must
begin. Like a drtmken street bum, We
Steelers fans need rehab. The following. are
the seven steps to recovery from this trau-
matic event:

° Steps 1-3. Anger; First, do some
heavy—duty scapegoating. Three steps
worth. Just choose any one of the partially
responsible parties and let them have it. Yell
things like “That damn Kris Brown! Why
must his kicks be blocked?” or “That damn
Kordell Stewart! Why must he throw so
many interceptions?”

Most of us are already past this point.
If you’re not, you probably should stop
soon or things could get out of hand. If
you’re at “That damn SpongeBob
SquarePants! Why must he secretly per-
form black magic on the Steel City?” you
probably nwd help. Move on to the next
step.

0 Step 4. Substitution. For a hardcore

' training camp isn’t that far
away. Who knows, maybe the Bucs will

-win it all this year. You have at least until

the second week of the season to keep
telling yourself that.

. - Step 5. Perspective. Let’s keep
things real here. Sure, the _Steelers ‘did get
embarrassed on national television, but hey,
at least we get on national television. Just
imagine the poor slobs living in Montreal.
They have to watch Canadian football.

Also consider the fact that you don’t
live in a scorched earth NFL town like
Buifalo or Cleveland. Not only do their

teams suck, most of each city’s residents .

have to actually wake up and go about
spending their lives in Buffalo or
Cleveland.

Are those weird Philadelphia Eagles
fans, or “douche bags” as I like to call them,
giving you some crap? Remind them that

their team also choked as bad as Dubya on

the Super Pretzel’ factory tour.

wants to start something, just say that Kurt

Beware of threesomes in your relationships

Is it possible to not have a threesome?

To be completely honest, I would have
to say no.

All of my past relationships have been
threesomes. I

I recently came to realize that anytime
I was part of an “us,” there was always a
dark ﬁgure lingering close by. There was a
constant reminder of something or some-
one that I could never be.

Recognizing that my brief excursions
into the realm of “us” shouldn’t be any-
one’s aspirations, perhaps they can serve as
warning signals. These examples should
serve to have you back-pedaling faster than
a cocaine addict coming down runs to the
bathroom. I

My ﬁrst threesome was with an idea
so encompassing and universal, that I
never had a chance. During my summer as
a camp counselor, I met a guy named
“Tom.” I didn’t know it at the time, but at
age 18, I was the ﬁrst person he had ever
kissed. He felt guilty and shameful about
the idea of sex. He wouldn’t even allow

himself to kiss me without spending the
next day in prayer.

It became quite clear that the mountain
footpath I was on was far from the pristine,
glorious, harp playing, holy path of
‘”I‘om’s.” My open mind and free will

pared to a woman that I wasn’t. Why
would I want to even try to be his mother?
How could I ever be as wonderful as the
woman who brought him into the world?
Most recently and shamefully, I found
myself involved with “Jason,” a man in the

clashed harshly with the strict
dogma he had internalized in
the womb. “Tom” turned out to
be the most devout Bible-
banger that I have come across
in 21 years.

Then there was my three-
some with “Jeff.” At ﬁrst, I
thought it was endearing that
he talked to his mother every
day. Initially, I took it as a good

  

sina lp

midst of a breakup with a
woman he was with for two
years. A fact that remains a
footnote in my mind is that
they still live together.

My live loudly, jump-
now-ﬁgure-it-out-later phi-
losophy has proven once
again to kick merather ﬁrm-
ly. It’s become more than
clear that this threesome

 

sign he was so close with his
mom that his day wasn’t complete unless
they spoke. But things soon took an abrupt
turn, as they so often do when I am in the
relationship equation. “Jeff ’ had to leave a
three-day camping trip early to “get back.”
I knew the reason immediately.

In the end, I was always being com-

wasn’t right.
“Jason” took months in ending a rela-
tionship with his girlfriend. Go ﬁgure that

I ending a relationship with a non-medicated

psycho is harder than trying to maneuver a
Pinto on the parkway after a four-inch
snowstorm during rush hour.

My Grandma tells me that it’s not so

much meeting the right person as it is the
right time. It has become quite clear to me
that this was not the right time for me to
start a relationship with him.

In the end of each of these relation-
ships, I was waving just over the horizon. I

. constantly felt that I was struggling to ad-

lib a scene that everyone else was already
holding the script to. With “Tom,” I was
attempting to be holier. With “Jeff,” Iowas
attempting to be like his mother. And with
“Jason,” I was tiying to give him more
space and- time to end a relationship.

God, a mom and a quasi-ex each kept
me safely sitting the bench. I was little
more than that almost afterthought.

I felt that this was all I deserved — that
it was OK for me to not be in the picture.

I’m not saying that I want to be any-
one’s mother or God; I would just like to be
on the ﬁeld to play a few innings. But how
brief the innings turnfout to be. c

Black and gold rehab
needed for Pittsburgh

McCarthy, page 8

‘Warner will be eating the Patriots for lunch like he does in his ,

Carnpbell’s Chunky Soup commercial’. Soon, you will hate oppo-
nents with all the potency of a rabid grizzly bear listening to Rage
Against the Machine —-,which is just as things should be. '

0 Step 6. Distraction. After you’re done making enemies with .

surrounding cities, remember to start a new love alfair with the
greatest pastime of all: the idiot box.

February is fast upon us and that means new episodes of your
favorite shows. This nationwide paciﬁer called “sweeps month”
will ease your football tensions. Within minutes, your brain will
return to loveable mushand you will cease to be able to accom-
plish simple tasks, like “lather, rinse, repeat.”

Ah, television. Without it, we would be forced to think and
thinking gives way to bad mental pain.

- Step 7. Preparation. Hey, spring break isn’t that far away.
At least that’s what those advertisements keep telling us. Kill your
black and gold blues by blowing that college savings on a some-
thing foolish and impulsive. Tell yourself that women really do act
like the ones on that “Girls Gone Wrl ” video, even if all you end
up doing this March is sitting in your parents’ basement watching
the aforementioned tape. , _

Soon thoughts of you and your old high school buddies throw-
ing that inevitable beer-heavy sausage party will give your old
Steelers thoughts the ﬁnger. For those of you actually going some-
where tropical and warm, remember that crying about football will
quickly take a backseat to trying to remember whom or what you
slept with the previous night and why you have so many rashes on
your legs.

Don’t wony -— something else will quickly become an emer-
gency this spring’ and football will only exist in video game format.

Checks for your rehab bill can be made payable to Dave
McCarthy ’s “I Need Some New Xbox Games Fund. ” Five percent
of the proﬁts will be used to aid local victims of Jan. 2 7. Email him

-Don’t pick and choose — just
choose Christianity?

In “Don’t Just Pick and“Choose Your

Religious Beliefs” (Jan. 25), Eric Miller

calls on college students to be thoughtful in

selecting a religion. ,
His column appears to me as an effort

‘to convince students of the “truth” of

Christianity. For those of us who practice
religions other than Christianity, this col-
umn has a number of troubling arguments
and conclusions. Miller argues that because
of the importance of religious questions,
people must acknowledge that the internal
logic of any religious answer dictates that
other answers are wrong.

As a Jewish student, one “benefit of the
Enlightenment that affects me‘ daily is the“

development of religious toleration. I am
free to go to class, engage with my peers
(evidently not Miller), professors and
friends without feeling compelled to
engage in religious polemics. I

W It is a rare day that one challenges me
to “prove”- the “truth” of my faith. While I,
as a religious minority, findtolerance to be
a wonderful thing, I simultaneously wonder
why Miller feels differently. Why does he
feel the need to write a column proclaiming
that all religious views that aren’t truth
(who is the arbiter?) are wrong?

There are so many social problems that

face us these days. Does increased reli-
gioiis intolerance need to be another? When
is religious chauvinism beneficial? When

 

' groups of people firmly hold that their reli-
' gion is the only right answer, and that all

other religions are “false,” tragic things
tend to happen. History provides us with
countless examples of what religious intol-
erance leads to: crusades, pogroms and
often war. Do these outcomes make reli-
gious intolerance desirable? ' 1
Additionally, while Miller does not
state his religious views, his argumentation

is distinctively Christian in nature. Is his , ’

claim “People should only accept one reli-
gion as truth” or “People should only
accept Christianity as truth”? .

Miller’s explanations for why the reli-I

gious question is of the utmost importance
are all grounded in Christian understand-
ings of religion and the world. He speaks of
pondering “what lies above” in reference to
heaven, which is a fundamentally Christian
idea. When questions about an afterlife are

posed in distinctively Christian terms, only

distinctive1y.Christian answers can follow.

He also discusses how “your afterlife is
on the line” and “eternity may depend on
it,” other signposts of Christian thought. I
disagree with Miller’s contention that ideas
about divinity should be “hot topics on
campus” and his thirst for debates about
the ” veracity of different religious
approaches. I believe that when Miller
frames these questions in specifically
Christian terms and then asks for debate, he

is asking for people to be intolerant of non-

Christian religions. p . '

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Don’t  
sleep on
Pitt ballers

 

Spears Vrzw

Kenneth Paul

Note to Pitt students; I hope you all
have your senses primed and ready.

Make sure you keep your eyes wide I

open, your ears focused on the buzz,
while being ready at all times for
screams and high-ﬁves, inhaling the
smell of victory. ‘

There is something very“ special on
our campus right now and that is the Pitt
hoops. »

It is hard to actually see greatness I 

and understand and realize that you’re
seeing it at the same time. It’s very easy
to take things for granted when it comes
to a winning sports team, that you’ve suf-
fered with for a long time.

All of you diehard Steelers and
Eagles fans. out there know what I’m
talking about. When you stick with a

team for a long time, claiming that you’

bleed in its colors, religiously watching
week by week and year after year, it
becomes a part of your life.

Many people claim that Pitt is not a

‘ basketball school, but you cannot blame

people for not attending games, when the
product on the court has been so poor for
so long.

Things have changed.

In my four years here, I have never
had the privilege of witnessing a team, in
any Pitt sport, that played with such a
united character, consistently buying into
its coach’s strategies, for a whole season.

This Pitt club is the» best that I’ve
seen in my time covering Pitt sports and

- I advise you, a Pitt fan, not to sleep on

this team.

Pitt fails to Solve Irish
puzzle in South Bend

WES BRYANT/PHOTO EDITOR

Ryan Humphrey (4), shown here defending against Brandin Knight during the
teams’ Nov. 12 meeting at the Fitzgerald Field House, scored 17 points last night.

J OE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

After knocking off some of the best
basketball teams the Big East had to offer,
the Panthers got a taste of their own medi-
cine Wednesday night, falling into a huge
hole early in the ﬁrst half ending in an 89-
76 loss to Notre Dame.

The Panthers were unable to stop
Notre Dame early, and unable to ﬁnd a way
to score baskets of their own, as the Irish
shot 67.7 percent in the ﬁrst half and led 49-
21 at halftime.

Notre Darne’s ﬁrst half output was just
eight points less than the Panthers’ defense
gives up on average per game. The Irish’s
49 points totalled more than Savannah
State, Illinois State and Northern Arizona
could score against Pitt in 40 minutes of
basketball. -

Meanwhile, Pitt shot just 33.3 percent
in the opening half, including just one-of-
10 from behind the three-point line.

“People get excited to play you when
you’re ranked,” Pitt coach Ben Howland
said during his postgame radio comments.
“We were poor in every facet of the game
early and they were good.”

Ryan Humphrey led the ﬁrst half
charge, scoring 15 of his 17 points before

Oakland Zoo gets wild at Field House

JEREMY JESTER
Staff Writer

When Notre Dame invaded the
Fitzgerald Field House Jan. 12, star for-
ward Ryan Hurnphrey heard chants -of
“Ashley, Ashley,” hismiddle name.

Syracuse player DeShaun Wiﬂiams,
previously arrested for drunk driving,
was heckled with “D-U-I! D-U-I!”

And West Virginia forward Chris
Moss, who spit on an opposing team’s
cheerleader,,was tortured with jeers from

"people wearing black plastic bags. '
One might think these actions are

coming from people who belong in a"
zoo. And they are. That is, the Oakland

Zoo.

Whether initiating “Let’s go Pitt”
cheers or isolating and irritating a'visiting
player, the Oakland Zoo is at every men’s
basketball game.- Donned in matching
gold shirts, the throng of approximately
40,students does whatever they can think
of to support the Panthers.

Sitting behind the visiting team’s
bench, a ‘growing handful of Panther
faithful, wearing anything from blue and
gold scarves to Julius Page—sty1ed “JP1”
headbands, cheer the team they love.
Sophomores Matt Cohen and Zach Hale
founded the Zoo through their enjoyment
of college basketball last year. ‘

“We both loved college hoops,” Hale

said. “We really didn’t have a student_

section and we were just sitting around
and it hit us. ‘Why don’t we just roundup

some people and have a good time?”’

Both admit that they were not always
Pitt fans, but they wanted to support their
college.

“I came here as a Vrllanova fan,”
Cohen said, “but it was obviousl had to
change my allegiance.”

The Zoo’s inception came from
Hale’s and Cohen’s disgust of a calm stu-
dent section.

' “Last year’s game against Syracuse
was when I got the idea,” Cohen said. “It
was quiet as usual, when my friends and
I saw we were the only ones cheering. So
we decided to get together and work
something out.”

After some thought, they settled on

Irish forward David Graves scored a team-high 19 points during Notre Dame’s 89-76
blowout of Pitt last night. Graves’ kept the Irish on top with his perimeter shooting;

Sharp Irish {shooting-in

Sports Editor

A quick Julius Page layin gave
Pitt a 2-0 lead. Donatas Zavackas
followed with a three-pointer and

Pitt looked like it was off to a great _

start. They were ahead 5-4.

That first minute of the game
was the first and last optimistic
moment of the night for Pitt as
Notre Dame trashed the Panthers in
the first half, en route to an 89-76
victory. The game was not nearly as
close as the score indicated.

Pitt was slow, sloppy and off
with its shooting in the first half,
while it seemed as though Notre
Dame was shooting through. hula
hoops as everything dropped for the
Irish.

It was a game of runs; unfortu-
nately for Pitt, none of them includ-
ed the guys from Western
Pennsylvania. ‘

The Irish had the inside-outside
game working to perfection as the
Pitt defense couldn’t stop Ryan

perimeter. Notre-Dame connected
on an alarming 67 percent of its
shots in the first half. .

And while the Panthers kept
coming close to making plays, the
Irish were executing, on their way
to leaving the Panthers in the dust.

Two runs keyed the Irish’s
assault.

Down 4-3 early, the Irish went
on a 17-0 tear, capitalizing on every
Pitt mistake. Jaron Brown turned
the ball over, and Thomas exploited

‘ the mistake, with a dunk.

Toree Morris grabbed an offen-
sive rebound and abruptly lost it.
That falter was followed by four
consecutive points from Humphrey,
a fifth-year player who was unstop-
pable as Zavackas and several Pitt
defenders failed to put up a chal-
lenge.

Pitt showed poor. court aware-
ness throughout the game, having
several rebounds poked away and
by making several.un-forced errors
as Julius Page-and Ontario Lett both
stepped out of bounds with the ball.

led the Irish with 19 points and Matt Carroll
chipped in with 15 points and six rebounds.

Brandin Knight was able to rediscover
his scoring touch, leading all scorers with
20 points, however most of them came in
the second half after the game was out of
reach. —

Knight also had six rebounds and seven
assists.

‘Tm glad we showed some pride in the
second half,” Howland said. “We had not
faced that kind of deﬁcit and we battled
back”

Unfortunately, it was not enough.

The Panthers started the game on a
good note, as Julius Page drove through the
Irish defense for a layup, giving Pitt its
biggest lead at 2-0. ‘

Notre Dame answered with a three
from Tonian Jones, but Page, who had
seven points, put Pitt back on top, 4-3, with
a reverse lay-up for the Panthers’ last lead
of the game.

After an Irish steal, Thomas put the
Irish up 5-4 with a fast "break dunk. The
Irish then caught ﬁre, going on a 15-0,
which the Panthers never fully recovered
from. .

Pitt cut the deﬁcit,to 12 with baskets
from Chevon Troutman, who had a career-

high 12 points, and J aron Brown, who tied

continued to pour it on.

Jones hit another three, this time from
the comer, to put Notre Dame up by 17.
Humphries followed that by scoring the
Irish’s next six points before Knight hit a
jump shot to put the score at 38-16. '

The Panthers looked to draw closer as i

the half came to a close, but a steal by
Graves with less than 30 seconds left in the
half led to a basket by Thomas and the Irish
went in at halftime with a 28-point lead.

Page gave the Panthers some hope by
opening the second half with a three, but the
Irish answered with a lay-up by Jones and a
three—pointer by Carroll. - '

The Panthers were able to muster an 8-
0 run midway through the second half, cut-
ting the Irish lead to 23, on two baskets by
Ontario Lett and a three from Donatas
Zavackas.

Notre Dame came right back, taking
advantage of Pitt’s inability to make free
throws and keeping the lead around 20
points for most of the half.

‘ The Panthers made just nine-of-19 free
throws in the second half, with many of
their misses killing what could have been
promising runs. . ' »

“It has been a problem from the free
throw line all year and we didn’t do a good
job,” Howland said.

An 11-2 run pulled Pitt within 17, and
the Panthers cut the lead down as low as 12

Despite loss to Irish,
2001-O2 Panthers are a
special teamin Oakland

Paul, page 11

This team has been able to do things
that no other Pitt team has been able to do
in years.

' The new—look, no-ﬂash Panthers control

games. They are patient shooters that
continuously eat up the shot clock, like a
kid with the munchies crushing some

«o» ﬁies.

The team returned without its two
leading rebounders from last season,
Isaac Hawkins and Ricardo Greer, but
have crashed the boards with a cockiness
unseen at Fitzgerald Field House as the

players seem to expect to pull down.

every board.
Effort. ‘
Jaron Brown exempliﬁes the 2001-

- 02 Panthers. At 6—foot-4 inches, he leads
‘ the team in rebounding.

Brandin Knight, who can also be
found in the paint following shots, is a
point guard’ in every sense of the posi-

tion, arguably the best general in the Big

East.

Knight, who also leads the team in
scoring, has been relentless on the court,
playing just about every minute of every
game. , ,
What can you say about Knight’s
backcourt mate, Julius Page? He is

shooting as well as ever, as he haunted;
Georgetown twice and put several dag-

gers through the heart of Syracuse.

The bench has performed all season,
with all types of unusual suspects step-
ping up. Redshirt froshes Mark
McCarroll and Cheyy Troutman are blos-

soming, while Chad Johnson and Ontario ;

Lett have effectively relieved starters

Donatas Zavackas and Toree Morris.
This Pitt team, unlike many in the

past, has proven that it can handle adver-

"sity. It won two seesaw battles at Boston

College and Rutgers, while ignoring the
fact that Syracuse‘ was supposed to be a
powerhouse. ‘

The losses at Miami and at home to

Notre Dame, woke the team up a bit and
taught_ the young squad how to win.

» Notre Dame has Pitt’s number, but every

team has "its kryptonite.

Though it has become customary to
constantly rave about a winning team’s
stats, that is an issue that I will bypass.
There is only one statistic that matters
with this team and that stat is the one in
the win column. ' ‘

With one of the best defenses in the
nation as I selectively forget about last
night’s results, Pitt has climbed to No. 21

in both nationally recognized polls. After

winning 18 games, the team has some
very winnable games remaining.

‘Pitt has seven games remaining, with
two games against Seton Hall, two
against West Virginia, one at Syracuse,
and home games against Rutgers and

Villanova, which takes place this

Saturday.‘ ‘

There is no reason that the team can’t
win ﬁve of its remaining seven, though
every game is winnable. S

The liberally predicted ﬁve wins
would put Pitt at 23 for the season,
thoughall the team really needs is anoth-
er three wins, plus a win in the Big East

toumament to lock up an NCAA touma- ' .

ment bid, Pitt’s first since the 1992-93
campaign. «

Ben Howland has done a marvelous 2

job up to this point, and I fully expect for
him to have his team’s psyche recuperat-
ed from last_night’s Notre Dame debacle
by the time they lace their sneakers for
the ‘Nova game. i '

The ‘Nova game, like the previous
four Big East home games, is sold out,
but this Monday you’ll have another

chance to get your hands on tickets for ’

next Thursday’s Seton Hall matchup.
Get ‘em while you can because once
March Madness comes around, you

‘won’t be able'to catch a shuttle to get to

the game.

Irish capitalize on Pitt errors,
build big lead in first half  

First half, page 12

we were dropping the ball and not
catching passes,” Pitt head coach
Ben Howland said during his post-
game radio comments. ‘‘All of a
sudden they just went on a roll.”

Graves walked -freely through
the lane for a layup, putting the Irish
up 14-4. Another Pitt turnover, this
time in the form of a Brown travel,
permitted Harold Swanagan and his
injured ankle to hit a turnaround
jumper over Mark McCarroll to
extend the lead to20-4.

Pitt would fight back, cutting
the margin to a 25-13 deficit at one
point, but Notre Dame’s Tom
Timmermans, who had played in
just six games this season, took the
baseline to the hoop, scoring over
Toree Morris. It was just that kind
of night for the Panthers.

Timmermans’ score ignited
another run as the Irish scored 16 of
the next 19 points. _ »

Torrian Jones followed
Timmermans’ basket with a three-
pointer, which was proceeded by

nine straight close-range points
from Humphrey, who finished the
half with 15.

It seemed as though the first half
could not go any more poorly for the
Panthers, but it continually did.

Knight and Brown missed con-
secutive layups and once again, the
Irish took advantage as Graves

scorched the nets for six more“

points, giving his team its largest
lead, at 47-21.
Pitt looked as though it would

refused to let Pitt get away that eas-
ily. He hit a baseline jumper as time
expired. The 49-21 first half deficit
that Pitt had to endure proved to be
too large.

“I don’t think I’ve ever been
down 28 points in a game at the
half,” Howland said.

Thomas’ last-second basket
gave him 11 points for the half,
while Graves finished the half with
nine.

Panthers in scoring in the first half
with four points apiece.

The Oakland Zoo has become a vocal part of basketball games at the Fitzgerald

fan frenzy in stands

the current name. Cohen believes it rep-
resents “a bunch of kids in a zoo acting
‘crazy?’

Their first appearance came when
the Panthers upset Seton Hall last year.
The then small group painted their eyes
black in reference to a ﬁght that occurred
between Pirate players Eddie Griffin and
Ty Shine a few days before the game. I

Ever since, the group has grown.

Coming into this season, the Zoo
was hoping the Pitt athletic department

would sponsor free T-shirts for the stu-' -

dents with the Oakland Zoo logo embla-
zoned on them. But the athletic depart-
ment refused to embracethe diehard stu-
dents and gave away Aeropostale ‘_‘Aero
Zone” shirts instead.

“We’re absolutely in favor of our
students in support of the Panthers,”
Director of Sports Marketing Chris
Fenis said. “But as «far as us in distin-
guishing every single faction of students,
it’s just impossible for the athletic depart-
ment.” . V i 

“We want to work with our stu-

_ dents,” he said. “What they are doing in

support of the Panthers is great.”
' The Zoo persevered. '

“We have not gotten a lot of support
from the athletic department,” Hale said.
“We would like to have their support, but
they have their corporate sponsors. We
want it to be for the students, not corpo-

rate run.”

“They just didn’t agree with us,”
Cohen added. “But at least we are getting

along with them now.”

Seemingly on their own, the Zoo has
grown and earned the respect from Pitt
players and coaches.

“I appreciate their enthusiasm,” Pitt

~ head coach Ben Howland said. “They’re

having fun and that’s what college is all
about. We’re just glad they’re with us
and not against us.”

“We see them on campus,” guard
Julius Page said, “and they are always
here for us. We love them.”

The Zoo recently received" money ‘ ’ I

from the Student Govemment-Board and
is planning to hand out more than 450
shirts. They are hoping the shirts will
help build the small group of friends into
an intimidating fan‘ base.

“It’s . not just a group of friends,”
Hale responds to the notion. “Heck, I
don’t even know everyone’s names now

that it is so big. We just want to have our .
' own student section.”

Cohen enjoys. all aspects of the Z0
not just the heckling. ' =

“It’s cool because we meet the visit-
ing team’s players, friends and family,”
he said. “When we do research on them,
we learn a lot of interesting infonnation.

. It just feels like We’re part of the game.”

,4 The future of the Zoo is still in the
air, though.,While “trying so hard to get
fans into games and them not respond-
ing” frustrates Cohen, his fellow Zoo
member is more optimistic.

“We just want to have our own sec-

tion,” Hale explained. “You would have ,

to have a shirt on to get in. We’re just try-
ing to get people interested in college
basketball.” --- .
