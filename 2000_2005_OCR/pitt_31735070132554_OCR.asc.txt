against alcohol  
in grocery stores

JONATHAN CHECK
Staff Writer

Eggs. Milk. Bread. Whiskey.
Could you buy it all on a future
visit to your local Pennsylvania
grocery store?

Possibly, if some state officials
in Harrisburg have their way. While
the sale of alcohol in Pennsylvania
is limited to state—owned stores for

now, you soon may be able to find ‘

your Jack Daniel’s next to your

Apple Jacks at supermarkets across

the “Keystone State.”

But two groups have joined
forces to fight this pending legisla-
tive change, claiming it will have
sweeping social and economic
repercussions for the residents of
Pennsylvania. "

The Independent State Store
Union, along with Pennsylvanians.
Concerned B About Alcohol
Problems, demonstrated outside the
State Office Building Downtown
with; an informational picket last
Monday and Tuesday, Aug. 25 and
26. »
Passing out ﬂiers that read,
“Say no to liquor at grocery stores,”
the coalition promoted its bifurcat-

ed mission to maintain job stability‘

for liquor employees,. whose jobs
might be ‘threatened .if alcohol
became available in places other
than state stores,_and to limit the
expansionof alcohol availability
for the general public.

_ The Pittsburgh picket followed
a’ similar demonstration at the
Pennsylvania, Liquor Control Board
Northwest Office Building in
Harrisburg, on Tuesday, July 1, by
the Pennsylvania Alcohol Control

Team, a group comprised of state-
store union and PCAP members,
along with members of United
Methodist Witness of Pennsylvania.

PCAP, a non-profit organization
with non-denominational ties to the
church, maintains an abstinence-
based philosophy regarding drink-
ing,‘which it teaches to youngsters
through its school program.

The group supports the state-
owned system currently in place,
believing its regulatory practices
help to moderate drinking and curb
the social problems associated with
alcohol abuse.

But that regulation would
decrease if _liquor were put on
supermarket shelves, said Brian
Smith, executive director of PCAP

and spokesperson for PACT, who

was in town for the two-day picket.
Proponents for the decision, he said
in a press release from the ISSU,
are newspapers “that are eager for
and currently deprived of alcohol

‘advertising “dollars.”

Efforts to expand the sale of

alcohol-by what the press release‘

calls “The Out of Control Board”
have coincided with a $104 million
out in drug and alcohol treatment
services, according to the state-
ment. ‘ ‘

The sale.of alcohol, he said,
should not be rooted in profits, but
responsibilities. ,

While Smith admits that the

. state—storesystem, with its limited

locations and hours, affords an
inconvenience to adults, he says it
is an inconvenience that responsi-
ble adults should be willingto

Meal blocks rise in value, a

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

The recent buzz around campus
has been that the worth of blocks
from the meal plans has gone up by
25 cents.

Students seem to be concerned
about why the prices have gone up
and where the extra 25 cents are
coming from — dining dollars,
their meal ticket or Pitt funds.

The answer is that, now, a block
on a meal plan is worth $5.25 — as
opposed to last year’s $5 -
because of a rise in the cost of some

. foods, according to Marty Millner,

general manager of dining services
at Sodexho. Sodexho is Pitt’s on-
campus food provider.

“There are over 500 items you
can purchase on campus with meals
plans and dining dollars, but the
cost increase only affected about 50
food items, mainly deli items,”
Millner said. ‘

“We try to do a little tweaking
of the menus each year, so we are

sure to improve the menus in each

dining area on campus,” Millner
said.

- “Any changes we make, either
to the menu or in prices, must first
go ‘through Eli Shorak at Pitt,”

Millner added. Shorak is Pitt’s

 

few foods also rise in cost

associate vice chancellor for busi-
ness. .
There are currently two “all-
you-can—eat” resident dining halls:
Jock’s Place in Sutherland Hall and
C—Side at the Marketplace in the
Towers. All other dining halls are
retail facilities where you pay per
item.

The area in Posvar Hall that was
once occupied by The Second Plate
now contains an Einstein Bros.
Bagels shop, and other Einsteins
will soon be popping up around
campus.

Pitt is also looking to build new
eateries in areas on campus that
currently do not have any, including
putting another Einstein Bros.
Bagels in Benedum Hall and a con-
venient snack shop serving pizza,
hot dogs and other snack items up
at Sutherland Hall.

“The snack shop [at Sutherland]
will be a nice, little hangout for the
folks up there on top of campus,”
Millner said.

These projects should be" com-
pleted by this coming January.

“We also want to improve the
look and ﬂow of the Schenley Cafe

in the William Pitt Union, along,‘ 5

with renovating the Marketplace__in
the Towers by’ next summer,”
Millner said.

Who deserves the blame for tragic death?

On Wednesday, Allegheny County
District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr.
announced that Rev. Henry Krawczyk
will be charged with involuntary
manslaughter, among other charges, in
relation to the June 18 falling death of
19-year-old Pitt wide receiver Billy.
Gaines, who was intoxicated —— from
alcohol provided by Krawczyk — when
he fell.

Gaines, along with place-kicker
David Abdul, had been staying — with-
out diocese permission, which church
ofﬁcials say would not have been grant-
ed, had it been sought —— at the rectory of
St. Anne Church after his Oakland apart-
ment caught ﬁre.

Apparently, Krawczyk was in the
habit of hosting booze—soaked cookouts
for Pitt football players. Krawczyk
asserted, in an afﬁdavit, that he was
aware all the players he provided alcohol
to were under 21.

Krawczyk had converted part of the
rectory laundry room into a bar, and
often took particular drink orders from
the young men.

Gaines’ death is a terrible tragedy, a
promising young life ended far too soon.
N 0 one debates this, and it’s difﬁcult, in
the face of such heartbreak, to consider
pointing ﬁngers. But, in this case, blame
needs to be laid, and forcing Krawczyk
to answer to legal charges is at least a
start.

This incident is not the first time

allegations of misbehavior have been

leveled at the reverend. In 1986 and

1992, complaints were made against
-Krawczyk, alleging that he provided
alcohol to youths. After Gaines’ death,
police seized more than 100 bottles of
alcoholic beverages from the rectory.

Clearly, Krawczyk is not the respon-
sible, trustworthy A adult ﬁgure society
expects clergy members to be. His posi-
tion in the community implied that he
had a certain degree of maturity, and he
fell disastrously short of that. He’s clear-
ly a troubled, irresponsible man.’

Setting his lack of reliability aside,
though, there are other disquieting
aspects of this case.

Two separate complaints, six years

apart, were made against Krawczyk.
These should have been investigated.

Two young men staying at a church
rectory should have raised ‘a few eye-'
brows among their peers —— although,
from the sound of it, the rectory was a
pretty close approximation of a swingin’
bachelor pad, and perhaps no one want-
ed to “ruin it” for Gaines and Abdul.

The specter of alcoholism, if not
something more sinister, seems to hover
above Krawczyk. His peers "must have
been aware of this character defect.

Too many blind eyes were turned on
this man over the years, and, as a result,
a life has ended. Krawczyk should face
scrutiny, but so, too, should the commu-

mty.

This guy is what encouraged my best
friend and I to venture beyond the Oakland

scene, to Shadyside, to try our luck with an

older crowd — the mysterious graduate

themselves as the bar—guy type.

In Shadyside, I was
expecting the well-adjusted
law, business or medical
school type: suave, future in

reality really does bite — hard.

my tastefor the bar scene and any desire to
make an attempt to meet a member of the
opposite sex. I’m not kidding.

Back up —— yes, the bar-guy has turned
me off to guys in general -—— at least this
week.

My best friend and I thought, igno-

reserved for a particular breed of South
Oakland-based Pitt undergrad, whose
stomping grounds located him within the
conﬁnes of the Forbes Avenue strip of bars.

My bubble has burst, and I am left
frustrated and alone, wondering if I will
ever meet a genuine and attractive man,
and whether it is really worth the effort.

I will never peruse the supermarkets

on the bus, I generally avoid eye contact. ’

I don’t want to say that the bar—guy has

A summer immersed in the black arts of retail doublespeak

Do you need any help reading this column? Are you
sure? If you do, please don’t hesitate to ask either me or
any of our helpful associates.

If you’ve ever bought a television, these questions
should sound familiar to you. They’re standard procedure
in the world of retail sales. If any of your friends haven’t
read this column yet, tell them to grab a copy today. We
can only guarantee its price until tomorrow.

This summer, I worked for a large, corporate, elec-
tronics retailer. Now, it’s probably not fair to tell which
store — especially if I ever want my job back — but, as
the narrator of “Fight Club/” says, it was “a major one.”

While employed there, I was taught the black arts of

retail-sales technique, better known as “lying.” The first

thing they told me was that there is_ no customer who can-
not be sold something. Are you an Eskimo? You need a
microwave. An Arabian prince? You need. a freezer.
Anyone else, you need both. Actually, you also need a
Palm Pilot. Better make that two Palm Pilots.

Nanoseconds after being hired in the television
department, I was bombarded with propaganda on the
importance of surge protection. First off, I learned, at
[retail store], we don’t sell “surge protectors,” we sell
“clean power centers.” ' ,

If you combine the words “trained” and “brain-
washed” you get “trainwashed,” which is how I classify
this reprogramming. “Clean power centers” don’t just
protect you against big storms —— they also improve your

1 electronics’ performance in ways you’ll never notice, like

ﬁltering the audio reception by 0.0006 percent on your
1972 black-and-white mono Zenith. We’d tell the cus-
tomers horror stories of our uncle Gus, who didn’t have a
power center, and thus not only lost his television in a

storm, but also contracted genital herpes and sponta-

neously combusted.

By rnid—June, I realized that I was in the business of
selling lightning insurance. Maybe next summer, I’ll sell
a device that protects against shark attacks or winning the
lottery too often. 1

When it came to actual television selling, I learned
that it.was more important to sell the extended warranty
than it was to sell the set itself. My trainwashing provid-
ed me with the term “performance service  1
plan ”

    

Side note + I’d love to be the guy who
gets to come up with‘those names. “What
do we got today, Ned?” “Well, this is a
device that punches you in the testicles.
Hmm, let’s call that the ‘voice performance :
remodulator.”’ -

OK, back to televisions. It’s important
to remind the customers that the set they
are buying today is an obsolete piece of

example of this than when a man who used to work for
Sony tried to buy a DVD player from our sales manager.

Educated customer: “Excuse me, I’d like to buy a
DVD player today, I was looking at the Sony model over
there.” 

Sales manager: “That model? You don’t want that
model, you want this one, it’s much more expensive.”

E.C.: “Um,»that model is progressive scan. I don’t
have HDTV, so I don’t need it.”

S.M.: “Really? Well, I guess you
haven’t heard that progressive scan makes
your penis larger.” - ,

E.C. “That’s the boldest, most overt lie
I’ve ever hear .”

S.M.: “I can tell that you’re man who
knows what he wants. Why don’t you just give
me your debit card and PIN and I’ll ﬁnish your
shopping for you.”

Cases like that of Samuel Desiderio,
who was awarded nearly $50 million in a
medical malpractice case, have provided
those who support a malpractice cap with
ammunition, not so much because of the
amount awarded, but because the jury-
approved amount was signiﬁcantly less than
the eventual amount of the award. '

» Doctors and politicians have been con-

single-payer system, in which every U.S. cit-

U.S. government, which, to cover the costs,

I’m sure he’d agree that the ideal situation
would be a method for distinguishing which
malpractice claims are valid and which are
ﬁivolous. S '

Plaintiﬁs considering malpractice law-
suits understandably think somebody should
be blamed, but have no clue whether the
medical procedure was carried out improp-
erly. Doctors will assure them that the best
possible effort was made, and lawyers will
guarantee a  of $500,000 in dam-

ages. Such lawsuits, even when unsuccess-

ful, greatly increase the expense of health
care, and, while plaintiffs should be entitled
to pursue damages, it would be beneﬁcial to
avoid these lawsuits as much as possible.

If an unbiased, knowledgeable third
party could investigate cases of alleged mal-
practice and inform these consumers as to
whether their lawsuit was viable or frivolous,
such costly lawsuits might be reduced.

Even beyond ﬂris, in our modern era of
specialization, the idea of a trial by a jury of
your peers might best be replaced by the idea
of a trial by a jury of people who know a
damn sight more ﬂran you. In simpler terms,
medical cases could be judged by juries of
medical experts. Not doctors, of course —
one would be hard—pressed to ﬁnd a doctor
who _is unbiased on the issue of medical mal-
practice. Rather, the jury would consist of
people trained in the same way as doctors,

and who are as knowledgeable concerning

proper procedure. .

Granted, it might be deemed unconsti—-
tutional, but then, the U.S. Constitution was

written more than two hundred years ago
when, if you needed an operation, you were
probably going to —die, so malpractice was
not a real factor. The Constitution was writ-
ten in a time when “doctors” knew little
more than their patients and thought it was a
good idea to slash their patients’ wrists in

Michael Tenaglia’s first
novel, “Anti Hero,” has a warn-
ing on the cover: “This book may
be offensive to the following
groups: religious fanatics, actors,
fat people, NYC cops, conserva-
tives, Russian cab ’ -drivers,
lawyers, heroin addicts, members
of the religious right, yuppies, lib-
erals. . .”,etc. These are just _a few
of the groups he names, and it is
clear from the very beginning that
Tenaglia’s work is full of life and
humor.

Billy Donovan, who
describes himself as an “anar-

lives iniNew York City and is at

true bohemian — not because he
aspires to be one, like the subur-
ban white kids trying to be gang-
ster rappers whom he rails
against, but because of his princi-

ples and choices. Majoring in the-
atre on scholarship from the
bricklayer’s union, he learns that
he is six credits short of graduat-
mg.

Deciding that experience is
better than a degree, he forgoes a
diploma and rents a dilapidated
apartment in Greenwich Village.
While this starts the story off, the
novel is not about Billy’s struggle
to break into show business. In

fact, he doesn’t perform for fame -

or fortune, he performs for the

novel is essentially about a work-

In Small Rooms
Disband

Ernest Jenning Record Co.

In Small Rooms, the new release
from the North Carolina foursome
Disband, is ﬁlled with punchy, amped-up
rock sounds, a fine example of what has
been a six—year, uphill trudge through the
music industry for this aggressive band.

“Capture the Flag” is a song with a
political message; it’s a song about war,
but it doesn’t reek of a manifesto, a la
Rage Against the Machine. Disband
stays away from screaming, blatantly
anti—govemment lyrics, and sings
poignant reﬂections on government and
war. I
Disband has ﬂourished through the
underground music scene since their
inception. In Small Rooms is the album

  Dis-band?Not this band

that shows perseverance pays off.

Filled with intricate guitar lines and
a strong rhythm section, In Small Rooms
is a powerful album. Over the guitar riffs
beam screamo vocals describing the
frustrations that come with being down
so long, struggling through the under-
ground of the music world, needing free-
dom and having that freedom in music.

It’s hard to say what or whom
Disband sounds like;it’s powerful and_
punchy music. It could be punk ifyou
really wanted to label it so, although giv-
ing music a certain label dilutes the true
music that is being produced. For exam-
ple, everything emotional has been
labeled “emo” and everything punchy is
“pop-punk.” _

Well, forget all of that. What
Disband sounds like is four guys from
North Carolina who can produce some
pretty decent music that is worth a listen.
And that’s more than can be said for
some bands , that haven’t struggled
through the underground music scene.

Pittsburgh’s Grand Buffet
open and readyto serve

Cigarette Beach

Grand Buffet

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

Looks aren’t what bring people to
listen to Nate and Matt Kukla, also
known as Grape—A-Don and Lord
Grunge, or by their given names
Jackson O’Connell—Barlow and
Jarrod _Weeks. Instead, people listen
to these two white rappers from
Pittsburgh because they are creative
with the beats that they use —‘ loop-
ing a lot of different sounds and beats
over each other — and because they
can rap. i ‘- ‘

Their newest release, Cigarette
Beach, is long for an EP'in terms of
tracks— there are ten —‘but in terms
of minutes, it falls right where most
normal five— or six-song EP’s do —
around the 25-minute mark.

One track, titled “The Old Folk
Smasher_s,” a quick song about
smashing old folks with one punch

 

because they have weak bladders and
fragile bones, is only 41 seconds
long, and has .a fun beat. '

S Another track, “Nate and Matt,”
is strong, with solid beats, though
it’s pretty basic —— they say ,their
names a couple times over. Yet it still
works. They mention Batman a cou-
ple of times in a few of the songs,
and, at the end of ‘the album, they
mention how much they like Batman
— because he is that cool.

Cigarette Beach is a lo-fi album
— it sounds like it was recorded in
their parents’ basement on a four-
track recorder, and that is nothing
new for Grand Buffet. Their sound
has always been lo—fi, and they like it
that way. It’s what makes thema
unique act‘, besides the fact that they
are two white guysfrom Pittsburgh.

Grand Buffet is no stranger to the
University of Pittsburgh campus —.
they usually play once or twice a year
here ~— and, every year, they play ‘a
show put on by the University’s stu-

vgdent-run radio station, WPTS.

Two white guys from this Steel
Town can indeed rap.

Moodring

Ashley Ruszkowski
Staff Writer ‘

With lyrics like “I hope you come
and spend the night” and “I hope you
have an appetite,” you are surely

- moved, or‘ rather aroused with Mya’s

latest release, Moodring. This ‘album
sends a‘ message of womanpower and
dominance — mostly sexual — in a
relationship. However, the attempt to
create this image was lost between her
whining voice and her zealous ambi-
tion to follow patterns established by
innovative pop artists like Mary J.
Blige and Missy Elliot.

The song “Fallen” has a great beat
and is sensual and sultry a standout
on the album. Also, “No Sleep
Tonight” is another pick with a little
more variety in rhythm that can easily
make bodies sway. Both songs are
catchy, but the 14 other songs sound
like something heard before: com-
plaints about other women stealing
men, infidelity and bitchy girlfriends.
Mya, however, stands out as a

has hit up Rite Aid and CVS trying to

“Sophisticated Lady,” on track 5. She
may need to get over herself before
she can concentrate on keeping her
man happy. V

Mya explores lovemaking and the
consequences of the act in “Late,”
when she confesses that she is overdue
for her monthly visitor, and that she

figure out when “he took a dip.” She
confesses “I know my body and it’s
driving me crazy.” A

Well, surely her body is driving
her crazy after all of the singing about
sex. At least this song is a trip for
many girls who have experienced
being late —— surely it will bring back
memories or even arouse some laugh-
ter. Finally, someone sings about that
predicament. Realize, though, it is
more of a laugh than an artistic accom-
plishment. ~ «

As Mya says, “My main goal is to
please you.” Mya is still young, but
maybe next time, she will not worry as
much about pleasing others and focus
more on her art form. She has a unique
voice and some decent lyrics. She just
needs time to fully develop as an artist. »

All in all, Moodring made me
more moody than moved, and I don’t
need an extra dose of that emotion.

sexy, sexy ﬂower. So, to satis-
fy my hunger for art—rock
pollen, I purchased tickets to
Radiohead’s performance in
Ohio last week. Because I
was involved, and because my life imitates
a wacky, prime-time sitcom, zaniness
occurred on my pilgrimage. To the moon,
Alice!

Many of you probably recognize this
situation: you want to go to a concert, so
you look for a friend to accompany you.
The only friend you can ﬁnd asks you to
buy the tickets on your credit card and tells
you he or she will pay you back Now, typ-

ically, said chum actually gives you the ‘

money in atimely fashion and the two of
you live happily ever after. My friends
agree to pay me, disappear into Canada for
almost a month, are unreachable by phone

the show starts, to conﬁrm that they are

One MapQuest later, I’m on the open
road, bound for the Cleveland area with
my absent-minded friend riding shotglm.
Luckily, despite the fact that he disappears
more frequently than Bigfoot in a game of
intraforest hide-and-go-seek, he was quite
adept at directing my vehicle. The ride was
going smooth enough . until the races
began. -

For some bizarre reason, every large

Oddly] enough, once in the

a bit of serendipity; however, because my
selection provided me with the experience
of hearing our 45-year-old waitress, Rita,
describe the cucumber sauce as “da
bomb.” Laughter —— and a big tip —
ensued.

Blossom Music Center, venue of the
show, is the coolest place ever. Not only
was the parking free, but the two cops in
attendance were letting everything go. I
mean everything. ‘Large-gutted frat boys
were toting a case of beer down a hill. Two
girls shared a KFC bucket. A group of high
schoolers openly packed a bowl in the mid-
dle of the lawn seating. All we needed was
someone doing a line off of -a stripper’s ass
and we’d-a had a Snoop Dogg party.

Radiohead took the stage to a huge
array of light and smoke effects, playing
exclusively to the substance~abusing
crowd. While being treated to an amazing
set of music, I felt bonded to my father’s
generation of pot-smoke trip music and
pictured a previous generation nodding
along to the likes of Pink Floyd or The
Grateful Dead. I felt elated to have road-
tripped to a concert. I could tell my chil-
dren about it someday. It could have been
the second-hand high I was getting, but I
have a feeling it was at least a little pride.

“Anti Hero:” a work of fact or fiction?

Anti Hero, page 7

As he paints rooms, teaches boxing at a
gym, acts and bartends, he ultimately
decides that writing will become his artis-
tic outlet. _

Like Billy Donovan, who likes to hear
and tell stories, Michael Tenaglia writes
with an easiness that lures the reader in and
places him or her on a bar stool in an Irish
pub called the-Blarney Rock. Much like-a
crowded bar, “Anti Hero” is f11ll of funny
and endearing characters that move in and
out of the story. One of the most amusing
and notable characters is Anthony, an
Italian with attention deﬁcit disorder who

advertises penis enlargers in porn maga-
zines and then sends his buyers magnify-
ing glasses. VV1th the last chapter of the
novel titled “I’m a Misﬁt and My Story is
Not Special,” Tenaglia spells out what is
apparent throughout the book: his story is
just that —— a story.

Based on Tenaglia’s biography, how-
ever, one can’t help but wonder how much
of the novel is ﬁction and how much is
fact. VVrth a narrator that is in some ways
reminiscent of J .D. Salinger’s Holden
Caulﬁeld, Billy Donovan makes us want
to shake off the conventions of society,
trust in true love and ﬁnd our own adven-
tures, wherever they may lie.

While it’s rare to see a

there were plenty of reasons
why Pelusi was the Panthers’

more. You can be crazy, and
that ﬁts my personality.

I goalie and the rest of the team?

JP: You have to be the crazy
person in the back that can just
throw I yourself into the play
and save a goal. Risk bodily
injury to make a save. I think,
as far as the team’s relation-
ship to the goalie, I think it’s

just kind of like the central

back player that can kind of be

a leader and director of play,

because we can see the whole
field.

TPN: What’s your favorite
sport, other than soccer?

JP: Slam ball or, ,well, I
like American Gladiators,
but I don’t know if that’s a
sport. We watch that all the
time. I also like_ gymnas-
tics. That’s weird, but I
like going to the gymnas-
tics meets.

TPN: What’s the most ‘embar-
rassing thing that’s ever hap-
pened to you while playing
soccer? ' -

JP: One time I went to punt a
ball and I kicked my shoe off.
It went all the way down the
ﬁeld, and my mom came and
had to put it back on and tie it
for me. That was pretty embar-
rassing. I

TPN: What’s’ the funniest or
oddest-sounding soccer term
that you use?

JP: I could tell you it, [but] it’s
censored. [laughs] I don’t
know, “boot it,”- I guess;

TPN: What goes through your
mind when someone is about
to take a shot on you?

JP: A million things, I think.
At one point, I’m thinking of
so many things, but on the
other hand, I’m trying to be
calm.-I think it’s a mix of that,
me over—thinking and me try-
ing to calm myself down.

TPN: What do you do in your
spare time?

JP: Hang out with my friends,
do arts and crafts, and watch

--television.

NCAA 2004 predicts Heisman Trophy for Spencer

“EA Sports. It’s in the game!” At least that’s
the saying that goes"along with EA Sports’ NCAA
2004, but is it really true?

‘I played the entire Pittsburgh Panthers’ season
already, (actually, I have played three seasons, but
who’s counting) and if it is “in the game,” then my
results should be what the expec-
tations are for the Panthers. OK,
well maybe it’s not 100 percent
accurate, but it is still fun to see
what could be.

According to my game, the
Panthers open up with two huge
blowouts with Kent State and
Ball State. By scoring 63 and'7O
points respectively, the Panthers
put themselves on the map, and
improved in the rankings up to No. 5 nationally.
This was helped by Ohio State’s early-season los
to Washington. I

Shawntae Spencer exploded onto the scene in
those two games, scoring five total touchdowns
and recording four interceptions. Spencer, who
returns kicks and punts, ran two punts back for
touchdowns against Kent State and had a third
called back because of a holding call on Malcolm
Postell.

“I’m OK in the game. I won’t say I’m real
good. I am not bad. I am an 88 overall, that’s not
bad,” Spencer said. /

In the next game, after struggling in the first
half against Toledo, the Panthers’ defense took
over in the second half. After knocking out two
quarterbacks — oneiwith a broken jaw, courtesy of

 

sPoR.x

   

Claude Harriott, and another with a mild concus-
sion delivered by Joe Dipree ——Spencer took over
again. Two more Spencer picks, one of which he
took to the house, sealed the deal and officially
made Spencer a Heisman Trophy candidate.’
Following the 3-0 start, the Panthers finally
' came into the meat of the sched-
__ ule. Fortunately, they were able
V   to handle Texas A & M and Notre
Dame with no problem, and thus
skyrocket the Panthers to No. 3
in the country, behind I only
Miami and Virginia Tech. _
Rutgers, Sy_racuse, and
Boston College were next on the
hit_ list, and they were no match
for the vaunted Panthers offense.
Rod Rutherford dominated by having his first
300—yard passing and 200-yard rushing game of
the season against Boston College. The option,
featuring Rutherford and running back Brandon
Miree, was almost unstoppable when run correctly.
1 Virginia Tech was next and was a slight strug-
gle for_ the Panthers and me. Following
Rutherford’s two first-half interceptions — the
only ones he threw all season — Rutherford rekin-
dled that magical spark with Larry Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald. was matched up against two—way
player DeAngelo Hall, but Hall could not match
the godlike video-game Fitzgerald, who caught 16

 

‘ passes for 283 yards and five big touchdowns. The 1

Panthers were victorious once again, and now
ranked No. 2 in the Bowl Championship Series.
West Virginia and Temple were both obliterat-

ed by the Panthers. Spencer continued to add to his
Heisman resume by making four picks and scoring
two touchdowns in each game.

The cover of Sports Illustrated, shown after the
game, featured Spencer, with the headline: “Once
an unknown, now Spencer is on everyone’s
Heisman ballot.”

At this point, all that stood in the way of a
berth in the Sugar Bowl and the nation’s champi-
onship game was a date with No. l—ranked Miami.
No reason to panic here, as the Panthers rolled to a
37-17 victory, which was not even that close. .

Brandon Miree’s big day — 212 rushing yards
and threetouchdowns — was the difference, since
the defense held Miami’s Frank Gore to a mere 37
yards rushing on 13 carries. Spencer added anoth-
er interception and all but locked up the Heisman.

Miami’s loss was Ohio State’s gain, by the
slimmest of margins. With Miami out of the pic,-
ture, only two teams had a chance to ‘play the
Panthers: Ohio State (11-1) and Central Florida
(12-0). The BCS computers left Floridians angry
and Ohio State was selected to play in the Sugar
Bowl. — 1‘

Shawntae’ Spencer won the Heisman trophy, A

set a national record for interceptions in a season,
with 19. y p .

“You won a Heisman Trophy with me? How
the hell did you do that?” Spencer asked. “It feels
real good [to win the Heisman], I am proud of you

[Milo], and I want to thank you first. I hope I play ‘

that good this season. 19 picks, ten touchdowns —

Panther mentand women to open
season at Duquense Quad Meet

. Cross Country, page 11

“To see them practice is one’

thing,” Webb said. “How they ‘compete

- is totally different.”

Webb said that the women still
appear to be a little better, overall,
entering the season, but he’s excited
about the men’s prospects. .

Two years ago, the women placed

seventh in the region. A number of’

players redshirted last season, and the
women dropped to 10th in the Big
East, but Freeman expects the squad
will rebound this year.
_ “They have a great opportunity to
have a special season,” Freeman said.
As far as Freeman can tell from
watching the men run in training camp,
he feels that they may be the best
group of men’s distance runners Pitt
has had since 1986-87.
Freemancredits Webb for focusing

on recruiting the men who can live up
to that team. He said that last year was
the first time during his four years as

Pitt’s cross country coach that the track -

and field coach made a major effort to’
recruit men’s distance runners.

Last year, Webb was named coach
of the year in the Mid American
Region. He is in his second season as
head coach at Pitt after spending three
years as a top assistant at Kent State.

Both coaches expect the freshmen
to make an impact this season.

Pitt begins its competitive sched-

- ule with the Duquesne Quad Meet, in

Schenley Park, on September 6.

The meet will feature Pitt, CMU,
Robert Morris, and St. Francis in a
match—up of 7 area
Joseph’s may also attend.

Freeman expects his runners to do
very well against the local competi-
tion. .

Gymnastics and
Slam Ball among
Pelusi’s favorites

Pelusi, page 11

TPN: If you could meet anyone in his-
tory, who would it be?

JP: I don’t know of one person, but I
would want to meet someone who was

' like a cross between Mother Theresa

and Jim Carrey. [laughs]

TPN: What’s something that people
would‘ be surprised to know about
you? '

JP: That I am like avlittle kid, I like
watching cartoonsand being goofy.

TPN: What kind of cartoons?
JP: Anything on Nickelodeon, like
Rugrats. Oh, and I am an amazing

dancer. [laughs] I love interviews.

TPN: We kind of like them, too.

man, I hope you are on to something.
I hope I can do it. You must be pret-

pty damn‘ good,” said Spencer.

Maybe I am that good, but so are
the Panthers, who finished a perfect
season with a 41-28 Sugar Bowl vic-
tory over Ohio State and the national
championship. Maybe the best news
of all came after the season, and after

two more seasons, when Larry,’

Fitzgerald graduated after four years
at Pitt. Since all that was in my
game, I hope it is “in the game.”

Matt Miloszewski is a staﬁ writer at
The Pitt News and feels he can take
down anyone in NCAA 2004, or
Madden 2004, and truly believes that

, the -Panthers will win the National
Championship. To issue a challenge"
