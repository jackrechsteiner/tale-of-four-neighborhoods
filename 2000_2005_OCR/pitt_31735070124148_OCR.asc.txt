Grade INFLATION:  Does

Pitt have the prob em others do?

“There has been a steady increase
in high grades (/1’s and B ’s) over the
past eight years at the University of
Pittsburgh and at most universities

in the United States. . ..High grades '

should he used only to symbolize
outstanding academic achievement
and not to reward students fbr
satisfactory work or to compensate
for a variety of non—academic
factors. . ..This phenomenon ofrising

‘ grades has been widely recognized

and reported in many media includ-
ing the daily press. Ithas been vari-
ously identiﬁed as ‘grade inﬂation’

and ‘grade erosion. ”’ -
—from the Feb. 2,1976,
report by the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences committee on
grading.

“Grade "inﬂation is back in
the news,” noted an opinion

piece in the April 12 Chronicle’

of Higher Education. Some say
the controversial issue never
went away, following an initial
wave of reports such as the one
by FAS’s committee on grading,
showing a pattern of inﬂated
gradingsince the mid-1960s.‘
Last week’s Chronicle was
referring to two recent reports:
a well-publicized HaI‘VaI‘d Uni-
versity study showing that, in
2001, half of its undergraduate
0 grades were A or A-minus, and a
report by the American Academy

statistical evidence of grade
inﬂation at U.S. colleges and

Pitt has not looked broadly

at undergraduate grade patterns
here since the 1976 arts and
sciences study. (Among the
Pittsburgh campus’s 15,367 full-
and part—time undergrads last
fall, 9,583 were enrolled in the
arts and sciences.)

Provost James Maher called I

grade inﬂation “an important

1 issue” but not an urgent concern
_ here. '

Toni Carbo, outgoing dean’
of the School of Information
Sciences, said: “It’s troubling to
me that we’re not looking at all
of the factorsthat may go into
what is called grade inﬂation.
To simply pull out grades and
say, ‘We’re awarding more A’s,
so there must be grade inﬂa-
tion’. is both simplistic and inac-
curate. Especially as we recruit

Starting salaries in 4

inimum’ salaries in
at least four of the
University’s 12 staff
pay grades fall below the recom-
mended living wage for Allegh-
eny County workers, as set by

' Pitt’s own University Center for

Social and Urban Research.

A 1997 study led by UCSUR
research associate Ralph Bangs
set recommended minimum

living wages for county workers, '

based on meeting the basic

  

  

Basic needs”
deﬁned as food, housing, health
care, transportation, clothing,
personal care, child care, life
insurance, a telephone and a
newspaper. ’

As of 2000, when Bangs last
updated his ﬁgures, the recom-
mended minimum living wage
for an Allegheny County worker

receiving health beneﬁts was’

$9.12 an hour — or $17,784 per
year, based on Pitt’s 37.5 —hour
work week for staff.

That’s more than the current
minimum salaries in Pitt pay
grades 1 ($11,040) through 4
($1 5,780).

Bangs said it’s likely that the
currentminimum salary for Pitt’s
pay grade 5 ($17,916) also would
fall below the current minimum
living wage, if inﬂation over the
last two years were ﬁgured in.

Except for the midpoint salary

        

for pay grade 1 ($16,344), the
midpoint and maximum salaries
for all Pitt pay grades exceed the
$9.12-an—hour living wage. See

Arts and Sciences faculty to review
proposed curriculum changes

rts and sciences faculty

will consider modiﬁed

College of Arts and Sci-
ences (CAS) general education
requirements at a meeting tomor-
row, 1:30—4 p.m., in the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room.

If faculty approve the modiﬁ-
cations and related administrative
changes, the revised curriculum
would apply to students entering
CAS next fall. The current CAS
curriculum was adopted in 1981 ,
and last modiﬁed seven years
ago.
Faculty shot down the most
controversial change that had
been proposed by CAS’s cur-
riculum review committee —
reducing from three to two
the required number of natural
sciences courses — but the
surviving changes number in
the dozens.

Among other things, the
proposed changes call on faculty
and departments to:

° Integrate oral, written,

information technology and"

quantitative skills across CAS
courses. ,

The associate dean for Under-
graduate Studies would get
$100,000, taken from FAS’s
savings from the faculty retire-
ment program, to support these
efforts. ‘

0 Develop courses that
address issues of diversity such as
race, gender, sexual orientation
and religious differences.

0 Implement discipline-
appropriate capstone experiences

for all majors. These experiences ,

might include senior seminars
requiring major papers, intem-
ships or laboratory research
experiences with written or oral
reports, or portfolios of artistic
work.

° Drop courses periodically
from the CAS general education
catalog if they have not been
taught at least once duringthe
previous ﬁve years.

The curriculum review com-

mittee did not reach consensus
on whether to afﬁrm, abolish
or strengthen CAS’s foreign lan-
guage requirement. So, faculty
will be asked to approve creation
of a committee to examine the
requirement. This group would

report to CAS Council on or _

before the council’s April 2003
meeting.
The new CAS general educa-

, tion requirements would include:

an introductory composition
course; two writing-intensive
courses; a quantitative and formal
reasoning requirement; one
course each in literature, music
or art, and philosophy; a second
course in literature, music or
art, or creative expression; a
sequence of two foreign lan-
guage courses; three foreign
culture/international courses;
a non—Western culture require-
ment; -one course each in histori-

cal change and social science, and -

three natural sciences courses.

Eaxtend belnefits to all partners V

To the editor:

As the University adn1inistra— .

tion comes to a decision about
same—sex partner beneﬁts, we
urge them to heed the ]many
voices within the University
community raised in support of
these beneﬁts. Faculty in the

medieval and renaissance stud-

   
   

ies program, the 
program and the women’s—stud—
ie_s program support the right
of same—sex partners of Pitt
employees to receive all the
beneﬁts available to employees’
spouses. As an equal opportunity
employer, the University of
Pittsburgh claims to support
principles and practices of equal-
ity in the workplace. Beneﬁts
such as health insurance and
tuition remission for family

members are important elements »

of compensation for faculty and

staff. The University’s practice ,

of denying these beneﬁts to
same—sex partners contradicts its
commitment to fair and equal
treatment of its employees.
This denial also undermines the
University’s ability to attractand
retain talented workers. -

The University of Pittsburgh
should stand by its commit-
ment to the achievement of

A campus memorial service
was held this week for John
K. Hall II, a lecturer in the
Department of Psychology, who
died April 2, 2 002, at his parents’
home in‘ Elizabeth, Pa. He was ‘
37.

Hall was teaching three
courses this semester — Intro-
duction to Clinical Psychology,
Introduction to Psychology,
and Abnormal Psychology —-— to

.more than 500 undergraduate

students.

“He was extraordinarily
popular with his students,” said
Anthony R. Caggiula, chairof
psychology. “He used alot of
humor in his teaching, was very
well organized and thoroughly
prepared, and was very open

Hall H J  

to his students —-— he really
connected with them.”

Hall earned a B.S., magna
cum laude, in psychology; an
M.S. in psychology, and a Ph.D.
in clinical psychology, all from
Pitt. He was a teaching fellow and
teaching assistant here before’
he left to work brieﬂy at La
Salle University as an assistant
professor. He returned to Pitt
in 1999, where he worked ﬁrst
as a part-time instructor, then
as a lecturer.

.Hall’s main area ofresearch
was schizophrenia and the sib-

APRIL 18,2002

Legislators say they will look
into additional Petersen costs

0 state legislators plan
to press Pitt’s adrninistra-
tion for more details on

ﬁnancing of the Petersen Events
Center, following reports that
the University is seeking an
additional $10 million on top
of the $53 million that the state
already has committed to. the
project. I

1 Pitt had hoped to inaugurate
“The Pete” by holding April 2 8’s
commencement convocation
there, but the ceremony was
moved back to the Mellon Arena
when it became clear that the
new facility would not be ready
intime.

State representatives Don

Walko (D—North Side) and Bill
Robinson (D-Hill District) said
they need to know more about
Pitt’s plans for funding the events
center.

“I don’t want to make a
mountain out of a molehill,
and I absolutely support Pitt

 

and I support the [Petersen]
center,” Rep. Don Walko told
the University Times yesterday.
“But when I was asked for
information by a reporter last
week and I didn’t know the
answers, I felt there was a lack
of communications between Pitt
and the legislature. I just want to
understand what’s happening. I
was asked why we appropriated
$15 million [more], and I said,
‘No, we didn’t.’ I think there
was some sort of disconnect in
communication there.

“Now, as I understand it, Pitt
is asking for $10 million more,

. whether it’s for a food court or

a ﬁtness center or whatever,”

yWalko said.

He said he expects to clarify
speciﬁcs on Pitt’s request at a
scheduled meeting tomorrow,
April 19, with Jerome Cochran,
Pitt’s executive vice chancellor.

duced a bill, supportedin» the

would retain the power to

is expected to exceed $96 inil—
lion, up ﬁ‘om the projected $52

ofﬁcials had adjusted estimates
of the cost to $79 million.

lower than are

“Although I sometimes wonder
how people can live on these
salaries, what Pitt pays [its
lower—salaried staff] is the going
wage locally for these types of
positions.” .
Ramicone urged BPC to look
not just at salaries but also at
fringe beneﬁts available to Pitt
staff -— beneﬁts that include
the University’s comparatively

‘generous, contributory. pension

plans; free Port Authority bus and
trolley rides; access to campus
recreational facilities, and tuition
beneﬁts that enable staff, their
spouses and children to earn
University degrees at.a small
fraction of full tuition.

Ramicone cited an office
in his administrative area (he
declined to specify which ofﬁce)
that is, he said, staffed almost
entirely by single or divorced
women with children. “These
staff tell us that what they are
most concerned about are the
tuition benefit and medical
coverage,” he said.

To date, $83 million has
been spent on construction and
other costs, according to the
state’s Department of General
Services. I

In January, Pitt requested
permission from the governor’s
ofﬁce to use $15 million of this
ﬁscal year’s $20 million state
capital project appropriation
toward the cost of the events
center, which the governor’s
ofﬁce approved, according to Pitt
spokesperson Robert Hill.

Last week, Pitt requested an
additional $10 million in new
funding from the state legislature
for the events center project,
Hill said. “We are projecting
that we will need another $6.2
million,” he explained. “That
is related to'moving some activ-
ity from Trees Hall to the
Petersen Center in this expanded
recreation facility. We have asked
for $10 million in case we need
more than the $6.2 million. If
we do not, the remainder would
go to offset other projects where
the costs are greater than what
the projected costs were.” Hill
declined to specify‘ those proj-
€CtS. ' '

Rep. Walko said of his interest
in the Petersen center funding:
“I don’t want to make this seem
negative. I just think it’s our
ﬁduciary responsibility to see
where money for capital projects
is going. We just need to keep
a closer eye on things. I think
maybe this is a weakness we have

V at the General Assembly.”

_ Walko said he supports the
bill introduced by Robinson to
establish a state board to oversee


O r I

“T ere are policy issues
here as well: job creation goals,
aesthetics in the neighborhood
where capital projects are going
up, minority and women goals
[for construction opportunities] ,”
Walko said. “I just think it’s our
duty to keep on top of these
projects all the way through the
process, when we appropriate
money and while the projects
are underway.” A

Robinson‘ said he fully sup-.

It’s not unusual for secretaries
and clerical staff to leave higher-
paying jobs at banks and other
Downtown employers in order
to work at the University and
utilize its tuition beneﬁt, said
Ramicone. '

UCSUR’s Bangs acknowl-
edged that “having a good ben-
eﬁts package compensates for
low salaries to ‘some degree. But
in setting a minimum living wage
you’re talking about ‘meeting
basic needs such as housing and

food, and beneﬁts may notmeet

basic needs.

“For example, getting free
[Port Authority] rides is a nice
fringe beneﬁt,” Bangs said. “But
not everyone can use public
transportation to get to work
or to meet basic needs such as
shopping for food or visiting
their doctor.”

UCSUR’s 1997 living—wage
report concluded that in Allegh-
eny County,. 200,000 working-
age adults and 111,000 children
were livingin families that lacked

  

ported the building of the campus
center. “I’m a big Pitt supporter,
including their athletic teams,
and Pitt had a legitimate need
for the center to be competitive
in the Big East.”

Pitt’s basketball teams will
begin play this fall in the Peters-
en’s 12,500-seat arena.

But Robinson insisted that
higher education institutions,
including Pitt, are driven by
athletic, rather than academic,
priorities, creating what he

' called a “sportsocracy,” a term

coined by a Temple University
professor, he said.

“We need a new relationship
between athletics and academ-
ics,” Robinson said. “You only
have to look at when Pitt brought
back Johnny Majors as football
coach and upon his arrival he
was making way more than the
chancellor of the university,”
Robinson said. “Sports programs
are driving college campuses.”

Robinson acknowledged, but
dismissed, Pitt’s position that
the Petersen Center is more
than a basketball arena and will
serve students in a wide range
of ways. ‘

“I don’t agree with Pitt on
that,” Robinson said. “I’m uneasy
with the budget situation, where
it appears Pitt will increase
tuition, but also is asking the
state for more money for its
athletic facilities. The Petersen
family gave money for naming
rights, but in terms of the whole
project, it was a small amount.

They get their name plastered
on this building, and I’m sure
the University will be selling

the building, and I think the

state should get a cut of -that.
I think the state should have a
better business relationship in
the public—private deals where
so much taxpayer moneyis
involved.” .

Robinson said he intends
to meet with Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg during the next few
weeks to discuss Petersen Center
ﬁnances. 5

The Alliance for Progressive
Action, a coalition of groups
pushing for living—wage initia-
tives, made UCSUR’s study a
cornerstone of its campaign.

That campaign was stopped in

its tracks last month, legislation-
wise, when. Pittsburgh City
Council effectively killed the
city’s living wage requirement
(which had been set to go into
effect April _1) by voting 5-4
to delay implementation until
Allegheny County approves a
similar policy. _

With city and county living-

Bangs characterized it, the Alli-

focused on pressing Pitt and
other individual employers to

at is the litmus test
to determine if an
action is unethical?

“Ethically, I can’t kill you,
but I can take your job,” Pitt
professor Steve Farber pointed
out at last month’s conference
on ethics sponsored by Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA).
“Taking your job certainly has
an adverse effect on you, but
it’s not considered unethical: It’s
just part of the game.”

Farber, who is director of the
public and urban affairs program
at GSPIA, said his background
in economics leads him to see
most issues through the prism of
cost—beneﬁts analysis. .

“I thinkof ethics as a trade-off:
something that’s a beneﬁt to one
group, but with repercussions
for others. Most of us would
agree that something is unethical
when there is a huge human cost
or egregious ﬁnancial cost —-'
like the Enron scandal. But is
the cost a matter simply of the
magnitude of adverse impact?
In the classroom, when we’re
teaching ethics, where do we
draw the line?”

Farber’s was one of many
questions raised at the all-day

Leaders: Helping Faculty Bring
Ethics Into the Classroom.”
Some two dozen presenters from
area universities, nonproﬁts and
government agencies focused
on various ethical components
in the workplace and how to
educate future professionals in
the rules and standards that
govern members of a profes-
S1011.

William Frederick, professor
emeritus at the Katz Graduate
School of Business, maintained
that Farber’s question was subtle
and difﬁcult. “As a society, we’ve
always said to ourselves that
ethics is deﬁned byvarious social,
cultural, religious and familial

conference, “Educating Ethical

 

   
  
 
  
 

anelists at a recent conferences on ethics agreed that in them}!

professionals from the working world can add signiﬁcantly

to the in-class experience of students by discussing real-life
events and ethical dilemmas. '

In practice however, the panel agreed, the system of employing
adjuncts was rife with pitfalls.

“Ideally, every course that touches on professional ethics should
be team-taught,” with an academici-an there to cover the conceptual
and a professional to cover the experiential,,according to VV1lliam
McKinney, dean of the College of Humanities, Fine and Performing
Arts at Slippery Rock University. “If we’re serious about getting
more ethics in the classroom, then both should be there all
the time. -

“In reality, of course, it’s too expensive and will never happen,”
he quickly added. '

McKinney was joined by other regional educators, including
several adjunct professors, at the session titled “News From
-the Front: Adding Value by Engaging Practitioners,” part of an
all'—day conference on educating ethical leaders sponsored last
month by Pitt’s Graduate School of Public and International
Affairs (GSPIA). .

David Korman, who holds a law degree, is a hearing ofﬁcer in
the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County and has been an

adjunct professor at Pitt for 16 years. “An adjunct professor brings ‘

real-world experience different from regurgitated facts,” Korman
maintained. “I think it’s sort of like hitting a baseball: You can read
all the books in the world about it, but that isn’t as valuable as an
hour watching Ted Williams in his prime.”

But Jim Weber argued that a practitioner is not necessarily
equipped to handle teaching. “When you invite a guest speaker
to come and tell ‘war stories,’ which I’ll admit are fun and usually
engage the students, that’s one thing. But what about the application
of a concept? Do the students learn anything?”

Weber, who is professor of business ethics and management, and
-director of the Beard Center for Leadership in Ethics at Duquesne
University, continued, “Also, we need to make a distinction:

rules that have evolved out of
philosophy or social science; that
anaction is unethical when a
basic human right is trampled,
be it little or big,” said Frederick,
who pioneered the teaching of
Business and Society at Pitt in
the 19505. “I believe we have
a built-in predisposition deep
in our brains that causes us to
react when something une_thical
happens, that stirs us up to say to
ourselves, ‘That’s not right.”’
But a comparable human
predisposition might well be

the source of why unethical -
I activities in our society continue

without abating, Frederick said.

the past 5 0 years, he said there are
three dominant explanations -—
summarized as character, culture
and nature — for unethical
behavior. -

“Was the Enron scandal
caused by men of ﬂawed char-
_acter? Are they just crooks?”
Frederick asked. “Or did Enron
happen because of the prevailing
corporate culture? Are there
flawed social values in corpora-
tions that pit one employee
against another: in this case, the
top dogs against the core people
at the bottom who lost their

retirement savings?”

Or, the third alternative,
recently put forward as the

result of studies in evolutionary
biology: Are there biological
roots for unethical behavior? In
other words, are some people
cursed with ﬂawed genes?

“The constancy of problems
over the long term gives evidence
that they are endemic to the
system itself, “ Frederick said.
“The problem of Enron and
Arthur Anderson is not new.
It’s spectacular, dramatic and
disgusting, but not new.” To back
up his claim, Frederick listed
his personal “dubious dozen”

i corporate scandals in the last 50

years, including Hooker Chemi-

cal and Love Canal; GM and

the Corvair; Union Carbide’s
Bhopal, India, gas leak; Ford
Pintos’ exploding gas tanks; Wall

Street insider trading; the Exxon‘

Valdez Alaskan oil spill, and
others of more recent vintage,
such as Ford’s SUVs versus Fire-

_ stone Tires culpability battle.

“I have come to conclude that
there is something innate in the
system of business,” Frederick
said, “and innate in many of the

people who are in business, and

it’s not just corporations: We
have the Olympics committee,
the Red Cross, the "Catholic
Church and some universities

Unlike an accounting class, where your can hire an accountant
easily, in business ethics you can’t ﬁnd too, many adjuncts off
the street, especially if they’re supposed to be full-time in‘ the
classroom.” - ‘ _ “

Weber added that universities sometimes hire adjuncts “if they
have a pulse and a social security number. [At Duquesne] we’ve had

Nancy Koerbel, an adjunct in Pitts English department, agreed.

“I wasa warm body working as a free-lance technical writer. .

The department agreedto let me teach written professional
communication,” Koerbel said. “I think we’re questioning, very.
basically, the ethics of using adjuncts to begin with. The English
department [at Pitt] needs them to meet student demands, but
they’re second—class citizens, with-little or no training and
much less pay.” « i j » V ‘ ‘

I Allyn A Morrow, associate professor and director of the Master’s '
of Business Administration Program at Chatham College, agreed
that using adjuncts merely as cheap labor is counterproductive,
although she said that it was much less common in professional
schools than at the undergraduate level. “We need to‘ have better
adjunct orientation and preparation,” Morrow said. “I think it’s
the responsibility of college administrators to interview them
thoroughly, before and after they teach; to look at their exams; to sit
in on a class now and then. And don’t rehire disasters.”

Morrow said that Chatham’s was a small enough program“ that a I

more hands-on observation of adjuncts was manageable.

Korman -added that most of what he learned about teaching
came from trial and error in the classroom over 'a number of
years and from his own initiative to use resources at Pitt designed
to help teachers. _ .

“Looking back 16 years ago when I started,” Korman said. “I
see that there’s a lot Pitt could have done: Faculty development, not
required; continuing education, not required. But using adjuncts ,
is here to stay in. our educational system and I think they make a
valuable contribution -— when it’s done right.”

that are all in trouble.”

Which explanation V an
instructor accepts will affect
what lessons should be taught in
training professionals-to-be in
the classroom, Frederick noted.

“If ﬂawed character is your
causative factor, you would look
to philosophy as an. academic
discipline and try to teach -virtu-
ous. personal traits: honesty,
trust, fairness, respect, justice,
honor.

“If you choose to focus on
corporate culture, you would
look toward the social sciences
and focus on organizational
values, such as community,
caring, diversity, equality, human
rights. V

“And if you believe ﬂawed
genes and the human hard-
wired brain are responsible, you
look to the natural sciences ——
evolutionary psychology and
biology, neuroscience — to
discover the biological roots of
unethical behavior. We now have
studies showing that many of
the things we admire — parental
care, alu'uism, nurturing of the
family — are indeed hard—wired,
that we carry a brain today that is
between 50,000 to 200,000 years
old without change. Biologists
say we still have Paleolithic
hunter-gatherer brains.”

This last, rather pessimistic
viewpoint,  not deter educa-
tors at the conference from

,,l,sugges»ing.f}leth0ds..for

“ethical principles.

Peter Madsen, executive
director of the Center’ for the

Advancement of Applied Ethics A

at Carnegie Mellon, told the
‘conference plenary session that
CMU recently decided to inte-

grate ethics across the cur-

’ - riculum, and appointed his center

to design and implement a pilot

program for the university. .
The program, dubbed ethi-

cal decision making (EDM),

uses inter-active web—based case

’ studies chosen by faculty to focus
on developing cognitive skills -

useful in real-world decision-
making. ‘ . '
“Bill [Frederick] is offering

categories that explain unethi-

cal behavior,” Madsen said of
F rederick’s presentation. “EDM
focuses on cognitive issues-rather

' than conduct issues.”

In the pilot program, a group
of faculty engineers, architects
and computer scientists ﬁrst
attended workshops .on ethical
theory and concepts. Faculty then
were asked’ to choose examples
of ethical dilemmas that are
relevant to their discipline, such
as causes of the 1986 explosion
of the Challenger space shuttle
for engineers, and then to put

the case studieson the web ford

decision analysis.

“In the old version of prob-
lem—solving, you start with an
analysis, look at alternatives, do
afeasibility study, then choose
among the alternatives,” Madsen
said. “But ethical decisions are
much more complex.’ Making

them is not a linear process. '

There are several ‘decision
points’ along the way, and there
are contributing social; contex-
tual and historical factors,’_’
including real-world pressures

to compromise ethical conduct,
such as meeting aggressive ﬁnan-
cial business objectives, meeting
schedule pressures and staying
ahead of the competition.
Madsen added that accredit-
ing agencies, including for engi-
neering programs and business
programs, more and more are
requiring that schools teach a
non-technical component in

‘professional ethics “to train

students in not just academics but
in their real-world professional
responsibility.” t

Three faculty from different
disciplines picked up on the
theme of teaching real-world
issues in one of the ethics con-
ference’s side sessions, titled
“Teaching Breaking Issues.”

Dane Claussen, associate
professor and directoriof the
graduate program in journalism

and mass communication at

Point Park College, said the chal-
lenge to teach ethics to‘ journal-
ism students is formidable.

“On the whole, journalism
students, who are in the midst
of a 50-yearincreasein their
numbers, do not see a distinction
between law and ethics or the
importance of either,” Claussen
said.

“There is cynicism among
journalists in the ﬁeld, and
they’re rather poor at reading
news themselves. Most students
say ethics is a matter of opinion

they even took one, didn’t solve
roblems.”
As of 1996, only 39 percent
of journalism programs even
offered an ethics course, Claussen

said. “VVhy? They say, ‘We talk

about this in every course.’ But ‘

that, to me, says it’s really not that
important to the program.”
Claussen also decried the

current tre_nd of the media

covering itself as news. “You
have- Koppel versus Letterman;
you have the Harvard -Business
Review writer who had an affair
with Jack Welch when she was
interviewing him. Are these
newsworthy?” he asked.
, Even worse, he said, are
news directors and reporters, in
deathlyfearof“gettingscooped,”
who are careless in their decisions
and sloppy in their reporting.
“Does the public really care
who gets scooped? Doesn’t the
public prefer having a. fair and

accurate story the next day?”

Claussen asked.

Despite the bleak picture,
Claussen said there were some
workable techniques for teaching
ethics to journalism students.

' “First, you have your own
ironclad standards in the class-
room. Sources have to be legiti-
mate and backed up, for example.
Second, you should expose
students to organizational codes,

' such as the one published by

the Public Relations Society_of
America. Third, you have to
expose the tendency to lump all
mass media together, when there
are major differences.”

In addition, students must be
made to develop personal ethical
standards that they can justify
and explain. “Pin them down.
And show them that there is
damage done by transgressions

that is more than the reputation
of the writer or the paper,”
including the reputation of
someone who is inaccurately
depicted.
“Finally, teach them .that
' professional competency is a core
value and that professional com-
petency and ethics are insepa-
rable,” Claussen said.
Lawrence]. Metts, instructor
in non—Western geography in
the regional planning depart-
ment at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania (IUP), cautioned
that ethics can be a relative
term.
-“Ethics are founded in the
culture of a society and so are
different from society to society,”
Metts said. “With my students,
I use the analogy of the U.S. as a
one-way mirror. Other countries
are always looking inside‘ our
borders for what’s going on, but
we seldom look outside those
borders. I tryto open that view to
students by looking at examples
in the news of regions we’re
studying.
, “For example, when we talk

‘about AIDS in sub—Saharan

Africa where there is no money
to treat it, I ask students, ‘Should

 

the countries treat it at the
expense of clean drinking water
or food?’ This opens their eyes

to ethical dilemmas they don’t

normally have to face as Ameri-

- cans and exposes them better to

the world.”

Metts said he’s had to train
himself to beable to say “I
don’t know” "when ethical issues
come up, including the events
of Sept. 11.

“Everyone was very upset.
But when students asked, ‘VVhat
should we do? VVhy did this
happen?’ I had to say I didn’t
know. In today’s society, where
time seems compressed, we
don’t always have a long time to
think about an ethical decision,
there’s more pressure on us as
individuals to act quickly, and
we sometimes have to weigh the
risk of thinking things through,
butI believe even thinking about
that is important in talking about
ethics.”

Mary Jane Kuffner-Hirt,
associate professor of political
science at IUP, said she demands
active participation in her classes.
“I don’t ‘feed information’ in
class, we develop it together,”
she said. “I require my students

to read at least one newspaper
every day, and to be prepared to
discuss whatever’s in it in class if
I call on them.” ' '

Kuffner—Hirt said that to

her, civic responsibility is not just
an intellectual subject, but an
important part of living an ethical
life, whatever one’s profession.
She awards bonus points for
students who can prove they
have voted, for example.

“In political science, you
can expect a certain amount
of built-in interest in ethics
in the students, even though I
believe ethics_should be covered
throughout all courses.

“But I want my students to
look at how ethical decisions
can put others at risk. And in
making those decisions, how do
you isolate the risks? How do
you evaluate them? VVhen the
government builds a road that
seemingly benefits the com-
munity, I ask my students, ‘What
if it’s your house they have to tear
down? VVhat if you’re displaced?’
I want to get the students to
‘feel’ what is happening. I try
to put them in others’ shoes,”
Kuffner—Hirt said.

She added that the teacher is
fair game for the students in
this regard. “I think it’s okay
to let them -ask the same ques-
tions of me, including personal
questions.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES,

...—...—..............—r-.._-M-err:

A look inside Pitt’s ﬁrst “green

itt is about to open its
academic “greenhouse,”
with more than 150,000
gross square feet of energy-
efﬁcient ofﬁces, labs and class-
rooms. . _
Over the next few months,
several Pitt academic. units
are expected to move into the
new Multi-Purpose Academic
Complex (MPAC), according to
Facilities Management ofﬁcials,
who led the University Senate
plant utilization and planning
(PUP) committee on a tour last
month.
FacilitiesManagementarchi-
tects Vl/"illiam Heaton and Park
Rankin, along with David Van
Dusen, project superintendent
for Turner construction com-
pany, showed off the new six-
story facility. ”
According to Heaton, Pitt
made efforts to make the building
“as ‘green’ as possible,” including
using recycled material for all the
carpeting and installing state-
of—the-art motion detectors for
the internal lighting system,
presence sensors for thermostat
control, and the latest electric,
computer-wiring and insulation
systems for maximum effi-
ciency. Permanent recycling

bins are located on every ﬂoor,

he added.
The MPAC building is bor-

‘dered by South Bouquet and

Sennott streets and Oakland
and Forbes avenues. The main
academic entrance is on South
Bouquet, with access to both
stairs and elevators to the upper
floors.

Pitt academic units will
occupy ﬂoors 2-6. The 1st floor,
currently being used as a loading
and construction staging. area,
will be leased» as retail space.

The main commercial
entrance is on Forbes Avenue.
The first floor can accommodate
as many as four stores, Pitt
officials said. Depending on
the number of stores that agree
to lease space, individual store
entrances may be added to the

Oakland Avenue side of the
building. The retail loading dock
will open on Bouquet Street.

Pitt ofﬁcials said the Univer-
sity is negotiating with Panera
Bread, a combination bakery-
cafe, but’ that no ﬁnal deal has
been inked. They declined to
specify other prospective ten-
ants. t

Short—term public parking —
20 surface spaces and 72 garage
spaces — will be accessible from
Sennott Street.

The College of Business
Administration (CBA) is moving
its administrative operation
from Posvar Hall to MPAC’s 2nd
ﬂoor in May,- according to CBA
Associate Dean Edward Palascak.
CBA admissions, advising and
placement will occupy the 2nd
floor, while CBA faculty ofﬁces

    
 

Top of ipage: The academic entrance to MPAC is on South Bo

will remain in Mervis Hall,
Palascak said. Classes will be held
in the new building beginning
this fall.

The psychology department
will be housed on ﬂoors 3 and
4, while computer science will
move into floors 5 and 6. ,

Psychology currently is
spread around the campus-with
ofﬁces and lab facilities in Lang-
ley Hall, Clapp Hall, Old Engi-
neering Hall, the Belleﬁeld Pro-
fessional Building and Gardner
Steel Conference Center.

The department expects to
begin moving at the end of this
month and to be moved in by the
end of May, accordingto Anna
Halechko, assistant department
chair. “We’re pleased that each
lab was made to particular speci-
ﬁcations,” Halechko said. “For

who have joint appointments

According , to Susan
McGregor, assistant dean for
administration, the Civil Practice
Clinic Program will be moving
to MPAC in mid—June. Accom-
modations are being made for
the program’s'clients, she said,
who often schedule consultations
after business hours. “A few
spaces in the garage are being
reserved for clients,” McGregor
said. “We also will be getting a
computer system from the I.D.
center that allows us to print
out authotizations for clients to’
enter the building.”

The space in the Law Build-

ing that will be vacated when the \

program moves across the street
already has been spoken for,
McGregor said. “Our informa-
tion technology department and
Professor [Alan] Meisel’s health
law program will be ﬁlling that
space.”

Robert Hoffman, director of
operations for the Department
of Computer Science, said his
department should be all moved
by June 15. The chemistry
department will take over the
space in Eberly Hall vacated by
computer science.

“We’re moving in stages,
beginning as early as April 24,
according to the most recent-
schedule,” Hoffman said. “I’m
particularly happy that we’ll
have our own top-of—the—line
computer network.”

According to architect
Heaton, different units expressed
different needs for their allotted
space. “For example, business

said. “Computer science wanted

space. We tried to respond to
each department’s needs for

space utilization.”

V PUP committee chair Atillio
Favorini pointed out that con-
sulting departments, especially
faculty, on their needs was an
important step in the process.
“In my experience, it’s a rarity for
faculty to be consulted regard-

Pennsylvania’s Department
of General Services kicked in
$20 million for the building,
which took more than two years
to construct. Although ﬁnal costs
are not yet determined, Pitt is
expected to pay about $9 million
for construction and at least
$1.2 million for furnishings and
equipment, ofﬁcials said. The
Universityis putting all new
furniture in the building. ‘

be open 24 hours, but valid
Pitt I.D.s will be required for

South Bouquet Street entrance.
After business hours, authorized
swipe cards will be needed to

Pitt received ﬁnal Pittsburgh
City Council approval for the
MPAC project in June 1999.
Construction began in January
2000 with the demolition of the
buildings on the site. 1 -

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Study shows almost 1/3 of non-medical
faculty received raises below inﬂation rate

early one—third of Pitt’s

N 1,652 full-time, continu-
ing faculty members
outside the medical school got
salary raises last summer below
the previous year’s 3.4 percent
inﬂation rate — even though
their supervisors judged that they
had done not only “satisfactory”

, but “meritorious” work.

Meanwhile, 378 of the 1,652

‘faculty members got raises of

more than '6 percent — in
some cases, considerably more,
although not all raises came
out of Pitt’s salary pool. For
example, a dozen dental medicine
professors paid thr‘ough the
VA Hospital got 25 percent
raises last year, one reason the
dental school boasted the highest
percentage increase in salary
budget (nearly 9.6 percent) of

any Pitt school. See cbzm‘.

Those facts appear in an
analysis of last year’s salary
increases for full-time continuing
faculty, prepared by Pitt’s Office
of Institutional Research for the
University Senate budget poli-
cies committee (BPC). School of
Medicine faculty were excluded
from most of the report’s tables
and charts because medicine is
not covered by the University’s
salary policy. (Unlike other Pitt
schools, medicine is entirely
self—supporting.) '

Some of the report’s revela-
tions pleased BPC members. For
example, most of the faculty
who got raises of more than 6
percent were in the middle salary
ranges, not the most highly paid
professors.

Also, the report showed that

the average salary raise for full-
time, continuing faculty outside
the medical school was 5.38
percent, which actuallywas more
than the 4 percent increase in
the pool of money for salaries
last year. Institutional Research
attributed that anomaly mainly
to the fact that each unit received
at least a 3.5 percent salary budget
increase based on its budgeted
number of ﬁzculty members, regard-
less of how.many of those posi-
tions were filled at the time. The
more vacancies a school had, the
more money there was to spread
around for raises to the school’s
continuing faculty.

Two BPC-members, English
professors Phil Wion and Ste-
phen Carr, said there was little
consolation in learning that the

average raise was 5.38 percent‘

when 526 faculty members took
cuts in real pay, despite perform-
ing meritoriously. .
Wion’s comments at -BPC’s
April 12 meeting echoed the
following paragraph from a letter
he wrote to Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg last summer: “It
cannot be good for the University

_ if signiﬁcant numbers of hard-

working, deserving faculty and
staff are repeatedly required to
sacriﬁce their material well—being
in order to subsidize significantly
larger increases for colleagues
or expenditures for other pur-
poses, no matter how worthy in
themselves.”

The chancellor, distributed
last summer’s 4 percent salary
pool increase as follows: 2.5
percent for “maintenance of
real salary for doing satisfactory

work”; 1.0 percent for unit-level
merit increases; and 0.5 percent
for market and equity needs in
certain schools, as determined
by Pitt senior ofﬁcials.

Prior to
announcement of how he would
distribute salary raise funds,
BPC had grudgingly endorsed
a 2.5 percent “maintenance”
component but protested that

a 4 percent salary pool increase '

wasn’t enough to meet Pitt’s
salary policy goals. I .
Stingy state appropriations
represent the biggest hindrance
to awarding adequate‘ mainte-
nance, merit and equity raises,
administrators and faculty here
agree. Pitt salary funds come
almost entirely from two sources:
the state, appropriation and
tuition revenue. Pitt’s overall
state appropriation increased
by just 0.6 percent last year,
prompting a 7.5 percent tuition
bike, Pitt’s largest in-13 years.
Gov. Mark Schweiker has recom-
.mended a 5 percent cut in Pitt’s
appropriation for next year.

see more A’s?” .

Arts and sciences Dean N.
John Cooper said: “Grade inﬂa-
tion is one of those areas where
there tends to be a lot of anec-
dotal concern, but we have not
instituted any systematic study
of it during my time at Pitt.”
Cooper joined the Department
of Chemistry faculty in 1986,
and chaired the department for
ﬁveiyears before becoming clean
in 1998.

“It may be something that
we should look at,” Cooper
said,,“but we have been rather
wrapped up with the College
of Arts and Sciences [CAS]
curriculum review during the
last few years, and we haven’t
prioritized [an examination of
grading patterns] at this point.

“VV1thinmy personal expe-
rience, I haven’t seen much
problem with grade inﬂation,”
Cooper added. “As chair of
the ' chemistry department, I
was occasionally concerned
about equity in grading because
sometimes you can have a faculty
member, especially a new faculty
member, who miscalibrates by
grading a little too easy or too
hard. I have at least as often been
concerned about people grading
harshly as grading leniently.”

V t a full faculty meeting
in 1976, FAS approved
. series of resolutions

aimed at reversing grade inﬂa-
tion.
“An immediate goal is to

V . reduce «the: number» of A «and -19} --

grades in undergraduate courses
to no more than 50 percent of the
total on average,” one resolution
read. A’s and B’s had comprised
52.1 percent_of all CAS grades
during 1968-69, 61.5 percent
in 1973-74, and 58.2 percent
in 1974-75. A
Faculty also called on the

. dean’s ofﬁce to publish, in the

FAS Gazette, undergraduate
grade distribution numbers for
each term — a practice that
ended after spring 1998; current
dean’s office personnel say‘ they
don’t know why.

During that term, 53.6 percent
of all grades in College of Arts
and Sciences courses were B’s or
better—- up from 49.1 percent in
spring term (their called winter
term) 1990.

Those percentages don’t
include B-minuses, which rep-
resented 7.5 percent of all CAS
grades during fall 1997, and 8.5
percent during spring 1990.

and A—minuses also increased —-
from 22.9 percent of all CAS

were A’s. '

A minor scandal erupted
when The Pitt News quoted the
writing program’s then-director
as saying, essentially: Awarding
lots of A’s and B’s encourages

students and creates a positive
classroom environment.
“Those statements were the
vestige of a feeling among some
progressive teachers that grading
gets in the way of teaching,” said
the English department’s current
chairperson, David Bartholomae.

.“I don’t think thatattitude is '

Bartholomae saidthe depart-

same time,” he added, “it is the
case that in small-enrollment

do a lot of revising of their work,
the opportunity for students
to do A-level and B-level work
increases.” ‘

Alexander Orbach, profes-

religious studies, sees a difference
between grading lower— and

’ upper-level courses. “I think

professors tend to be more
generous with freshmen, but in
1000—level courses they want
their students to really work for a
good grade,” Orbach said.

and so forth). But C’s appear to be

than in the humanities.
“At least in my department,

I have not seen grade inﬂation’

during the eight years that I
have been teaching here,” said
Chandralekha Singh, of physics
and astronomy. “For large,
introductory courses, our depart-
ment has a rule that, at most,
40-50 percent of grades may be
A’s and B’s, and the rest must
be C’s and below. There’s some
ﬂexibility, but not much. For
example, if we have a really
strong group of students, we may
award more A’s than B’s among
that top 40-5 0 percent.” '
By enforcing such guidelines
department-wide, physics dis-
courages students from shop-
ping around for reputed “easy
graders” among faculty, said

Singh.

1 Biological sciences professor
Iain Campbell said: “In the
sciences, we stick very tightly to
that scale where a C is the mean
grade in the course. I’ve been
working with that scale since I
came to Pitt 37 years ago.”

In contrast to humanities
courses in which students may
raise their grades by revising their
work, science courses require

“There was a fair bit of flack
aboard the ship over that.”

I Chemistry professor David
Pratt said he and his colleagues
frequently discuss grading issues.
One of the emotionally tougher
situations faculty face, he said,
is when a student pleads for a
higher grade in order to qualify
forgraduate school.

(English professor Richard
Tobias recalled: “During the
Vietnam War, it was: ‘If you give
me a C, my draft board will send
me to Vietnam and I’ll be killed,
and it will be your fault!’ At least
faculty don’t have to deal with that
kind of pressure anymore”) -

“QPAs really matter in this
world,” Pratt said, “especially
today when the focus is on
quantitative measurements. I
have good students who want to
go to medical school who aren’t
going to make it because their
QPAs aren’t high enough.”

Rather than cave in to stu-
dents’ sometimes-tearful pleas,
Pratt and his teaching assistants
compile positive information
about his students — awards,
volunteer activities, academic
accomplishments apart from
grades — for use in writing
letters of recommendation to
graduate schools and potential
employers.

“I try to bring these other
factors in, so that the grade is not
so dominant,” Pratt said.

“Professors do

of mechanical engineering. “We

. knowledge before moving on to

the next level, Campbell pointed

out. “That’s why it’s vital that.

our students not fall behind in a
course. Otherwise, they may not
be able to catch up,” he said.

While.volunteering as a biol-
ogy tutor at the faculty help desk
in the Cathedral of Learning’s
Commons Room, Campbell
overheard conversations among
non-science majors indicating
that “all they really needed to do
was go to every scheduled class,
and they would get a passing
grade without needing to do a
lot of work,” he said.

But it wasn’t until last fall,
when Campbell sailed as aca-
demic dean on Semester at Sea,
that he encountered a similar
attitude , among non-science
faculty from schools around the
United States. i

“There was a general feeling
among the humanities faculty
that the only grades [faculty
should give] were A’s and B’s,”
Campbell recalled. VVhen Camp-
bell declared that a C should be
the mean grade in a class, “some
of them were shocked,” he said.

and they’ll say: ‘We don’t want
to see anybody with under a
3.0 or 3.2 average’....So, there
is temptation there, knowing
that a grade has a real-world
implication.”
Barbara].Juliussen, associate

director of Placement and Career ,

Services at Pitt, said: “With
the exception of the big ﬁve
accounting ﬁrms and some other
top employers, the rest say
they’re not all that concerned
with grade averages. As long as
a graduating student has a QPA
over 3.0 from a good university
and can articulate what his or her
skills and interests are, they’re
well—positioned for interviews
with most employers.

. “On the other hand, having
a 3.9 QPA may earn you an
interview, but it doesn’t guarantee
your getting hired.”

A recruiter from one local
corporation even speciﬁed that
he wanted to interview graduates
with QPAs between 2.8 and
3.5. According to Juliussen, the
recruiter told Pitt: “Anybody
with a. QPA above 3.5 is probably
out of my price range.”

UNIVERSITY TIMES

AAAS study ﬁnds clear evidence
nationwide of inﬂated grades  

re college students
smarter than they used
0 be, or are A’s and B’s

just easier to get these days?

It’s the latter, according to
national study.

A report by the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences
(AAAS) offers clear evidence
of grade inﬂation —- deﬁned as
an upward shift in grade-point
averages without a corresponding
increase in student achievement
— at U.S. universities.

The authors of “Evaluation
and the Academy: Are We Doing
the Right Thing?” are Henry
Rosovsky, the former dean of
Harvard University’s Faculty
of Arts and Sciences, and Mat-
thew Hartley, a lecturer at the

. University of Pennsylvania’s

Graduate School of Education.
The study reviewed literature
from severalnational surveys to
draw some of its conclusions.
In one survey, covering the
years 1960-1978, with the sample
size of 180 colleges, the survey

A author concluded that grade

inﬂation continued unabated
between 1960 and 1977. From
1960-1974, the average GPA
increased nearly half a letter
grade, the survey found.

A second survey gathered:

data from 4,900 undergraduates
in the years 1967, 1976 and 1993 .
Data indicated that the number

‘of A’s increased n'"ca‘1-ly fourfold

(from 7 percent in 1969 to 26
percent in 1993) and the number
of C’s declined by 66 ercent
(from 25 percent in 1969 to 9
percent in 1993).

A more recent survey of
52,256 students comparing
the periods 1984-1987 and
1995-1997 showed that college
GPAs increased on the average
from 3.07 in the mid—’80s to
3.343 in the mid—’90s.

“When considered alongside
indexes of student achievement,”
the report stated, “these increases
in grades do not appear to be
warranted. During the time
period in which grades increased
dramatically, the average score
on the .;. SAT actually declined
5 percent (1969-1993).”

The A8 study cites a
variety _of possible causes for
grade inﬂation, including:

° Higher education’s response
to the Vietnam War and the
turmoil of the 1960s;

° Changes in curricular and
grading policies;

0 The advent of.student
evaluations of professors; ’

° The rise, in the 19805,
of consumerism — universities
operating” like businesses with
students as the customers; ‘

° The watering down’ of
course content, and '

° The increasing use of
adjunct faculty members.

Harvard report details its
own rising grade problem

he American Academy of Arts and Sciences study said

U that grade inﬂation appeared most noticeably at Ivy
League institutions, particularly Harvard. A study of
undergraduate grades at Harvard, released last November
by that university’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, showed
that almost half of all grades were A or A-minus. The
report details 16 years of _grade inﬂation, including the

° In 2000-2001 less than 12 percent of grades were

The study also found that mean grades for students in
small classes — 24 students or fewer — were almost 10
percent higher than those of students in large classes -

° Ninety-one percent of Harvard’s seniors last spring
graduated with honors (deﬁned as B—minus average in their

(According to an October Boston Globe story on grade
inﬂation at Harvard, by comparison, 51 percent of Yale
students graduated with honors; 44 percent of Princeton
' seniors, and 40 percent of Dartmouth seniors. In 1946,

undergraduate honors at Harvard were awarded to 32 percent
of the graduates, the Globe reported.)
As a result of the study, Harvard now is providing academic
‘ departments with their grading histories so faculty can discuss
departmental grading trends and policies._ ‘
Harvard also began requiring all faculty in its College
of Arts and Sciences to report their grading policies to a
supervisory body. That group, led by Dean of Undergraduate
Education Susan G. Pederson, is looking at the issue
. I

The Harvard faculty’s Education Policy Committee also is
looking at the data and is expected to make-recommendations
on grading in the coming months.

one reason commonly suggested

for grade inﬂation —' the increas— —
ing number of students from ~

diverse socioeconomic and ethnic
backgrounds.

The current trend of grade 1

inﬂation began in the rnid—1960s,
the study asserts, when minority
and lower income students made
up a small fraction of students
in higher education. That fact,
coupled with evidence that

minority students did less well .

than their white counterparts
with the same SAT scores, “does
not support the idea of faculty
favoritism toward minorities,”
the report said.

In advocating the importance
of meaningful grades, the report
stated, “ [Grades] inform students
about how well or how poorly
they understand the content
of their courses. They inform
students of their strengths,
weaknesses and areas of talent. . . .

' They also provide information to
external audiences: for example,
to colleagues not only in one’s
institution but to those in other
institutions, to graduate schools
and to employers.” A

The A3 study also explores
the potential consequences of
devaluation of grades, from
an increasing reliance on stan-
dardized test scores to more
dependence on personal and
professional connections over

  

ate school opportunities.

The A5 report offers some
recommendations for institu-
tions of higher learning:

0 Faculty members ought
to know how their grading
standardscompare to those of
their colleagues in their depart-
ment and at peer institutions.

° “The academic profession
is the only one that provides
virtually no formal training
or guidance to new entrants

concerningone of their pri— ,

ymary responsibilities: teaching
and evaluation.” Expectations,
responsibilities and standards
ought to be discussed -at the fac-
ulty committee or departmental
level.

0 Expand student transcripts
to include more information
on the meaning of a particular
grade, such as the number of
students in the class, and the
average,grade given.

° Establish standard grade
distribution (curve) in large
classes.

The A8 report also con-
tains a warning: “It is most
important to stress that, once
started, grade inﬂation has a self-
sustaining character: it becomes
systemic, and it is difﬁcult for
faculty to opt out of the system.
Vlfhen signiﬁcant numbers of
professors adjust their grades
upwards  others are forced
to follow suit. Otherwise, some
students will be disadvantaged,
and pressures from students,
colleagues and administrators
will soon create conformity to
emerging norms.”

s Pitt recruits more
undergraduates with
ky-high SAT‘sc_ores and

hypertrophic high school QPA’s,

: some professors have noticed

increasing shock, disbelief and
anger among students who earn
lower—than-A grades in their
courses. '

Indirectly, the profs say, stu-
dents’ indignation can translate
into grade inﬂation, as faculty
face the choice: Appease students
by awarding high grades, or risk
negative teaching evaluations.

“This is really getting to be a
problem,” said David’ Brumble,
who’s served on the English
department faculty since 1970.
“We’re getting more and more
Honors College students -— don’t
get me wrong, I’m delighted by
the kids I’m getting in my honors
classes — but these are kids who
are used to getting nothing but
A’s and A-pluses. ‘

“Just because they’re bright,
though, doesn’t mean they have
mastered acquired skills such
as writing,” Brumble noted. “I
see them in my Introduction
to Shakespeare class, and a fair
number of them don’t write very
well. I’m the one who gets to
tell them, after their high school
teachers have been praising them
for the last four years, that they
really need to work on their
writing. It comes as a _shock
to them when I give them a

' C on a paper. Some really get

incensed.”
That attitude can extend

to students’ parents, Brumble
found when he served during the
late—1’990s as associate dean for

- Undergraduate Studies in the

College» of Arts and Sciences.

‘_‘I recall one conversation in
particular with a parent, who
made it very clear to me thatthe
family was paying a lot of money
in tuition, and they expected
their child to get good grades,”_
Brumble said. “By that, they
didn’t mean that the student
ought to be doing better. VVhat
they. meant was: ‘Look, we’re
paying a lot of money for this,
and we expect a good transcript
to show for it. How dare you give
my child a low grade?” .

' Biological sciences professor
Iain Campbell, a 37-year veteran

at Pitt, said he’s noticing, “an .

awful lot of students who think
they’re a ‘lot better than they
are.” . ,
Richard Tobias, of English,
rememberedstudents’responses

to a question on his teaching '

evaluations last term: VVhat
grade do you expect to get in
this course? ’ .

“Half of the students wrote

that they were expecting to get .

an A,” said Tobias. “The other
half ‘said they expected a B. I
ended up giving several C’s and

two D’s to that same group of 9

students.”

Tobias, a Pitt English depart-
ment faculty member since 195 7,
said he’s seeing more undergrads
who, upon receiving a C on a
paper, respond: “This is the ﬁrst

APRIL 18,2002

 

C I ever got in my life!”

David Pratt, a chemistry
faculty member here for the last
32? years, said: “Many students
today seem to believe, ‘There’s
this safety net that is going to
catch .me, no matter what I do
in class.’ I think that’s different
from, say, 10 years ago.

“I have to be careful about

this, because I’m going to sound -.

like a grumpy old man,” Pratt
added. “It’s just that I’m seeing
more students whose high expec-

tations aren’t connected to ‘

reality. Occasionally, when I’m
forced to fail a student, the
student will say to me: ‘VVhat do
you mean you’re giving me an
F? I didn’t get an F!’ -
‘‘I’m ‘not sure where this
comes from, and I’m not being
critical. It’s just an observation.
VVhat’s important about this,
from the faculty point of view, is

' that we should be aware of these

attitudes and make a greater
effort to engage students into
really thinking about the course

material. It makes teaching more ,

challenging.”

Michael Kolar, a professor
in mechanical engineering, said
the attitude of today’s students

reﬂects a change in society. “I

really believe the world is differ-
ent from when I was growing
up. Parents these days are having
one, maybe two kids, and they
lavish attention on them. That
is the child’s only experience.

. There isn’t a sense of achieve-V

ment apart from parents’ praise,

which may be exaggerated. They :
develop an expectation that-
their teachers.will follow that
pattern.” ' . .

- Kolar, who has been at Pitt»
since 1986, said earlier genera-
tions of professors tended to be
harder graders. “A few years back,
when several of the engineering
faculty took early retirement,
I‘ think we lost many of the
hardest graders,” he said. “We
had one professor, who even
won a ‘teaching award, who was
very tough. If he had a 9 a.m.
class, he’d lock the door at 9
and not let anybody in, and —he
counted attendance toward the
grade.”

Professors said it can be
tempting, even for senior faculty,
to award higher-than-deserved
grades. (“It’s much more pleasant
to run a class when you’re
handing out all A’s and B’s,”
Brumble observed.).VVhere stu-
dents’ “grade expectations” really
threaten to produce grade inﬂa-
tion, they said, is among_young,
untenured faculty members.

“VVhat really matters,” Pratt
said, “is being fair with students,
making sure they understand
what you expect of them and

_ that you respect them. If you can

do that, the grade issue should
become less important. But that
can be hard to communicate to
a junior faculty member who
doesn’t have a track record and
confronts these kinds of pres-
sures” to award high grades.

Provost Maher on grading at Pitt

In an interview this week,
Provost james Maher talked about
Pitt grading policies and practices.

“I don’t think there would be
anything to he gained from my
oﬁice accusing certain professors or
academic units of inﬂating grades,”
Pitt’s chief academic oﬁicer said.
‘My approach is_ to press faculty,
generally, to keep looking at their
grading, to make sure it’s fair and
consistent and appropriate for their
disciplines. ”

But the provost did not rule out
a University-wide study of grade
inﬂation, faculty helieve strongly
that such a study is needed.

He noted that Pitt has no oﬁfcial,
percentage—hased grading scale (such
as 97-1 00 percent equals an A—plus,
80-82 percent equals a B-minus,
etc. ), and that grading standards

A can vary hy discipline.

-— Bruce Steele

University Times: Is grade
inﬂation a problem, or issue
of concern, at Pitt generally?
In certain units? Or, is it not a
problem at all here?

Maher: I think it’s an important
issue forus to think about, as we
try to make sure we’re doing the
very best we can by our students.
The grading system has at least
two purposes. One is to give the
student an indication of how his
or. her performance compares to
the professor’s expectations, and
the other is to give the student
a credential in the world. In
each case, it’s important that the
evaluation be fair and clear. So,

“v‘v”€ should think  
- we’re doing those things right. _

gh an opinion of their work is

'I’m not aware of anything
at the moment that is badly out of
line, either with national norms
or with the two goals of infor1n—
ing the student and informing
the world about the student’s
performance.

So, you don’t think Pitt should
undertake a comprehensive
study of its grading policies and
practices, similar tothe study
Harvard recently did.

I don’t think it’s urgent. If

each of our schools looks over ,

its own gradingisystem andasks
the two questions of whether the
system is succeeding in inform-
ing the students of their own
progress and giving the students
the credential they will need to
move on after they have gradu-
ated, I  that will be all we
need to do. And that is, of course,
part of the annual planning that
each of the schools does.

But if there is faculty concern
with this — and I could imagine,
given the fact that the grading
system at the undergraduate level
is demonstrably different from
what it was 20 ori30 years ago -
then I would welcome a careful
look at exactly what we are doing,
across the University. '

VVhat steps does-v Pitt take to
discourage grade inﬂation?
Every year, as part of the
annual planning, each school has
to review each of its programs.
The questions that must be
addressed have to do with the
appropriate education of the
students, as measured in a number
of ways, but basically looking
at the success of the students in
meeting the academic goals of

the program, they’re enrolled in.
The grading system is intrinsic
to that.

Given the improvements in
academic quality of fresh-
man classes here in recent
years, has Pitt — or will Pitt
— “ratchet up” its grading
standards for undergraduates?
Will it become harder for
students to earn high grades
here?

I would put a little bit differ-
ent emphasis in that question.
I think it’s important that every
student in the University be
challenged intellectually by the
courses that he or she takes.
Any professor who ﬁnds that the
students in the room are capable
of doing more than the students
who’d been in the room several
years earlier is going to want to
stimulate and challenge those
students to do their very best.

It’s hard to predict, discipline
by discipline or profession by
profession, how that’s going to
work its way into the grading
system. But the important thing
is that students feel challenged
and that they grow intellectu-
ally and personally. I would
be inclined to let the grading
follow in whatever way seems
most appropriate, as long as the
faculties of the schools are being
sufﬁciently reflective about the
way they are delivering their
programs, grading included.

During your career, have you
witnessed grade inﬂation? Do
A, B, C, D and F grades today
carry the same value they did
when you began teaching —
or, for that matter, when you
were an undergraduate?
Since my department, phys-

I ics, does have guidelines for how

grades should be distributed over
a large class, I don’t think there
has been very much grade inﬂa-
tion. I know that FAS [Faculty
of Arts and Sciences] ‘used to
publish grade distributions
within the different FAS divi-
sions, showing changes over
time, and that grades‘ in some
parts of the arts and sciences
became, during the 19805, sig-
nificantly higher than they had
been in the 19605.

In a recent Chronicle of

Higher Education op-ed.

piece, two College of New
Jersey professors contended
that U.S. colleges and univer-

_sities give students passing

grades for merely “going
through the motions of leam-

ing.” They also noted what
they called the metamorphosis
of F from an academic grade
for “failing to do acceptable
college-level work” into a

‘ disciplinary category for “fail-

ing to come to class” or “failing
to submit assignments.” Do
either of those statements
apply to Pitt?

Those statements are not, in
my experience, a fair indictment
of the grading system here. I’m
not aware of anyone at Pitt who
would pass a student merely for
coming to class,'and I also am
quite conﬁdent that most of our
faculty are setting a reasonably
high standard for acceptable
performance in their classes.

But if a student comes to every
class and turns in all of the
assignments, even if [those
completed assignments] are of
high school quality, wouldn’t
that student get a D rather
than an F these days, at Pitt or
most other universities?

I certainly gave F’s. I think
each professor has an under-
standing of what is the minimum
performance that should carry
academic credit. And that’s really
the test I always used in deciding
the difference between a D and
an F. I think that’s true of most
professors. .

Now, there are differences
in the perceived difficulty of
courses. Some courses may be
sufﬁciently easy to pass that the

- ..P¥.°_f.¢SS9F mightdo YV9_.“. F9..ElI3I1l‘
"a’bou‘t"whe’ther‘ the" minimum‘

standard for awarding academic
credit should be changed. But in
general, I think most professors
have thought it through rather
carefully, where the D/ F line
ought to be drawn. The distribu-
tion of A’s, B’s and Cs is more
the area where there has been
demonstrable grade inﬂation in
some areas of the University.

. How do grading standards
differ for undergraduate and ‘

graduate students?

I At most schools, and certainly
here ‘at Pitt, the grading system
in terms of letter grades is very
different for graduate students
than for undergraduates.

In the arts and sciences here,
an A-minus is the lowest grade
that says a student’s performance
is what onewould expect of
someone who should eventually
get a Ph.D. When a professor
gives any kind of a B to a graduate
student, the professor knows
that that student is going to
need to offset that grade with
some A’s in order to get the QPA
up high enoughto get a Ph.D.
eventually. Similarly, a B-minus
is too low of a grade to get a
master’s.

To a graduate student, a B is
‘what a C is to an undergraduate
student; Because, to graduate
with a ‘bachelor’s degree it’s
necessary to carry a 2.0 QPA,
which is a C. VVhereas, a 3,0
QPA is required for a graduate
degree. _ I

At Senate Council on April

two reasons for the University’s

policy:

0 Network security. If Pitt
allowed multiple connections to a

not ensure network security at
a level that would allow the

allow those researchers to do
their work. “Daisy—chaining
computers to a single port

represents a serious challenge

to the security integrity of the
network,” the provost said. '

0 Network speed. In addition
to replacing thin—wire ports, the
point of the upgrade is to create
a truly high—speed network,
Maher said. “We’re delivering
gigabit service to every build-
ing, and the functioning of a
high—speed network is seriously
compromised by units that have
multiple connections to single
ports.”,

Each of those reasons would
be sufficient for insisting on
dedicated ports for each com-
puter, said Maher.

"Port charges may be coming
down, he added. Computing

Services and Systems Develop-‘

ment is considering “a signiﬁcant
reduction in the cost of a port, and
theyintend to make it retroactive
to Jan. 1, when the port charges

came on,” the provost said. .
Cost reductions would result
from installing uniform ports
and charging a single price per
port — which can only be done
if each port will be handling a

single computer, Maher said.
* “The cost is a challenge,”

he allowed, “and we have been
working with the responsibility
units to try to ﬁnd ways to get
some reasonable schedule for
the switchover and yet not break
anybody’s budget.”

Maher’ urged faculty to con-
sider whether all of their comput-
ers really need to be connected
to Pitt’s network. Of the 20
computers in his own lab, he said,
only two are on the network.

In other Senate Council busi-
ness, Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg and six other administrative
members of Council abstained
from an otherwise unanimous
(19-0) vote approving a resolu-
tion onindemniﬁcation of Pitt
employees in research miscon-
duct cases. ‘

The . resolution recom-
mended increasing from $15,000
to $30,000 the maximum amount
that Pitt will reimburse employ-
ees for legal fees incurred in suc-
cessfully defending themselves,

V charges.

Nordenberg said he would
discuss the proposal with attor-
neys in Pitt’s General Counsel’s
ofﬁce. “I’m not opposed to [the

resolution],” the chancellor said, '

prior to the vote. “But having

experts at the Center for Sports
Medicine’ offer. the following
tips for marathoners and other
distance racers.

Fluid replacement and nutri-
tion: “If you are dehydrated, you
will not ﬁnish the race,” says
registered dietitian Leslie Bonci,
director of sports, nutrition at
UPMC Health System. “Drink-
ing water before, during and
after a long-distance race is
absolutely crucial.”

Bonci adds:

° In addition to water, lemon-
lime PowerAde will be the ofﬁcial
sports drink available to runners

during the marathon. Runners

should prepare their systems for
PowerAde prior to marathon
day.

0 During training, runners

' should practice how to drink,

swallowing in gulps (not sips)
out of paper cups while running,
and not just poured" over the
face or head.

° Runners should not con-
sume any new foods onirace
day.

° For instant energy, try
small packets of sports gel or
honey. ,

° At the ﬁnish line, runners
should continue drinking water.
They also should eat something
within 15 minutes of ﬁnishing

the marathon. A salted bagel-
or salted pretzels are good

choices.
Injury prevention: Brian Klu-
cinec, certiﬁed athletic trainer

and physical therapist at UPMC '

Center for Sports Medicine,
says the most common running
injuries usually are preventable.
Klucinec offers the following tips
for common injury prevention:
' Runners should wear a
running shoe that ﬁts their foot

on race day.

0 Alternate terrain and run-
ning surfaces during training.

° Many runners experience
overuse injuries by training too
intensely without giving their
bodies easy days in between. Also,
a sudden signiﬁcant increase in
mileage or a severely intense
work-out session could cause
injury. A couple of weeks before
the marathon should be spent
actually tapering mileage.

° Runners should be aware of

and address weaknesses in their ‘

own body biomechanics.

Recovering ﬂom the marathon:
‘‘It’s not over when you cross
the finish line,” said Susan
Mackey, certiﬁed athletic trainer
at UPMC Center for Sports
Medicine.

° At the ﬁnish line, continue
to walk around or og slowly, cool
down and then stretch.

° Runners should examine P

their feet after the race. Do not
try to treat a blister. Puncturing
a blister could lead to infection

and 1T101‘€ SCVCIC SOI‘6I1€SS. There '

will be podiatrists in the medical
tent to treat blisters properly.

° Stay with others for at least
six hours after the race in case

, medical problems develop.

.0 Drink plenty of ﬂuids
immediately after the race and
for several days thereafter.

5 ° Avoid fatty foods and main-
tain a high carbohydrate diet for
two to three weeks. '

° Treat the usual aches and
pains by ﬁrst applying ice.

° Take a short, slow run of 1-2
miles the day after the marathon.

p This will help in muscle stretch-

ing and recovery.

0 Avoid competitive long-
distance races for at _least two
weeks. I

will offer genetic testing and
counseling and conduct research
on the disease that affects 30,000
Americans, with as many as
1,500 western Pennsylvanians
considered at risk for developing

_ the disease.
A fatal, degenerative brain .

disorder that primarily strikes
men and women between the
ages of 30 and 45, Huntington’s
disease causes involuntary move-
ments, severe emotional distur-

bance and cognitive decline. As
. their bodies and minds deterio-

rate, affected individuals often
die from complications such
as choking, infection or heart
failure. .

Center (CLC) is offering two
new certificate programs in

In addition, the center has
become an approved education

. provider under Pennsylvania Act

48, which requires an educator
to set aside 180 hours for profes-
sional development activities
every ﬁve years in order to
maintain a teaching certiﬁcate.
The certiﬁcate in business

, software is .a noncredit program

that teaches students how to
create a‘ budget and ﬁnancial
analysis, develop presentation

information both on the Internet
and amongdatabase records.
To earn the certiﬁcate, students

spend 72 hours in the classroom ,
_ and present a portfolio of com-

also offer diagnosis; medication
for movement disorders; cogni-
tive and psychiatric evaluation
and treatment; physical, occu-
pational and speech therapy;
caregiver and social services,
and nutritional counseling. The
center also will be the only one
in Pennsylvania to offer clinical
trials to HD patients.

Robert Y. Moor_e, Love
Family Professor of Neurology,

‘departments of neurology, psy-

chiatry and neuroscience, is co-
director of the clinic with Eliza-
beth Gettig, assistant professor
of human genetics and director of
the genetic counseling program
in Pitt’s public health school.

2 “Although in 1993 research-
ers identiﬁed the gene that causes
this devastating disorder, there
is still no cure,” Moore said.
“There is hope as genetic testing
is available for family members
of Huntington’s patients, and
only a handful of specialized
clinics in the United States offer

treatment and research.”

In addition to 30,000 Ameri-

cans with the disease, another
15 0,000 are at risk because family
members have a 50 percent
chance of inheriting Hunting-
ton’s from an affected parent.
, “The personal stories of HD
families are compelling,” Gettig
said. “This is a complex disease
involving movement, mood and
heredity. Even if you escape the
disease yourself, you clearly are
not free as brothers and sisters
and other loved ones remain at
risk for developing HD. The
experience of living in an HD
family is a powerful one.”

The HD clinic will become
part of the Huntington’s Study

2 Group, a non—proﬁt group of

physicians and researchers in the

RESEARCH NOTES

Breaking the
rules leads to
faster chemical 1
synthesis .
Chemistry professor Dennis
Curran has found that sidestep-
ping one organic chemistry com-
mandment meant ﬁnding a faster
and more efﬁcient way of creat-
ing new chemical compounds

e and, potentially, new drugs.

Curran presented his radical
chemistry methods in a lecture,
“Fluorous Mixture Synthesis
Approaches to Natural Product
Libraries,” April 8 at the Ameri-
can Chemical Society’s national
meeting in Orlando.

Curran, Pitt Distinguished
Service Professor and Bayer
Professor of Chemistry, was
looking for a way to speed up the
process of synthesizing complex
molecules when he decided
to challenge an old chemical
adage: Never mix pure organic
compounds.

“The synthesis of complex
molecules like natural products
is painstaking and difﬁcult and
has always been done one at a
time,” said Curran. “In other
words, if you want to create two,
or four or eight compounds, you
have toperform two, or four or
eight painstaking syntheses.”

The problem with mixing
pure organic compounds is that it
is extremely difﬁcult to separate
the ingredients completely after
they have been mixed.

“We solved the separation
and identiﬁcation problem by

introducing ﬂuorous. .—..—. ..high1y.. 

ﬂuoiinated -——— tags, ” Curran said.
“These tags allow us to reap the
efﬁciency of mixture synthesis,
making more compounds each
time, yet we are still able to
separate and identify the mixture
components on demand.”

The process involves mixing
two or more compounds at the
beginning of the operation, then
performing only one synthesis. At
the end, the researchers de—mix,
or separate, the products.

“So, we get more than one
product from one synthesis, and
the ﬁnal products are individual
and pure, as if they were made
by separate syntheses,” Curran
said.

Curran’s methods work espe-
cially well for synthesizing

. models of active natural products

or other compounds to ﬁnd the
best drug candidate.

“Our new mixture methods
should help to discover drugs
more quickly,” he said. “Perhaps
even more important, they could
lead to better drugs, since more

compounds will be tested prior
to selecting a drug candidate.”

Curran and his colleagues
have started a Pittsburgh-based
company, Fluorous Technolo-
gies, Inc., to commercialize this
technique and other ﬂuorous
discoveries. ‘

UPCI scientists
present

Researchers at the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
(U PCI) presented their ﬁndings
at the 93rd annual meeting of
the American Association for
Cancer Research, held April
6-10 in San Francisco. '

Highlights of the presenta-
tions included the following:

Estrogenic activity discovered
in several commonly used
medicinal botanicals

Plant extracts often are used to
relieve gynecological conditions
such as menopausal symptoms
as well as depression and other
chrome illnesses. Although used
widely, many of these remedies
have not been thoroughly exam-
ined. Researchers at UPCI are
studying several plant extracts
to learn more about their safety,
potency and hormonal proper-

’ ties.

In one such study, UPCI

researchers found evidence_

that some of these extracts
interact with estrogen receptors
and induce strong estrogenic
responses in female rats whose

“Our resuls indicaitieiwthiaiti
some herbal remedies demon-
strate measurable estrogenic
activity, in spite of the fact that
they are not traditionally used
as such,” said Pat:ricia.Eagon,
associate professor of medicine
at Pitt and principal investigator

of the study. “This is important -

since it suggests that some
extracts may not be appropriate

for women who have a family”

or personal history of cancers
that are linked to higher levels
of estrogen, including breast
and uterine cancer. While plant
extracts can alleviate symptoms
for a variety of conditions,
women should practice caution
when using them and may want
to avoid their use for condi-
tions in which estrogens are
contraindicated.”

Of the extracts studied, moth-
erwort leaf, saw palmetto berry,
rhodiola rosea root and red clover
blossom were the most potent in
terms of their estrogenic activity,
and extracts of maca root, cramp

Critical cells in immune
response found inhibited for
tbeﬁrst time in prostate cancer
, Dendritic cells, as the pace-
makers of the immune system,"
play a critical role in the primary
immune response. They are the
ﬁrst cells to recognize antigens
and to assist in the production of
an immune response by helping
to produce antibodies to ﬁght dis-
ease. Pitt researchers have found
that prostate cancer tumors
produce factors that inhibit
the growth and proliferation
of dendritic cells and induce
apoptosis (cell death) in dendritic
cells. , A —

“Our data may explain the
strong immunological non-
responsiveness that we often
see in patients with advanced
prostate cancer,” said Nlichael
Shurin, Pitt associate professor
of patholo gy and associate direc-
tor of clinical immunopathol-
ogy. “For the ﬁrst time, we have
discovered that a systemic inhibi-
tion of the dendritic cells system
occurs in prostate cancer.”

In the study, prostate cancer
tumor cells were injected into the
bones of mice and had a direct
effect on stem and hemato-
poietic precursor cells (the
basic cells from which all other
cells develop). The interaction
between the tumor cells and
the hematopoietic precursors
resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition
in the cells’ ability to differentiate
into’ ‘fi1rfC!io‘I1‘al” “ dendi-it‘rc ‘ cells.
The study demonstrates that
the generation and function of
dendritic cells is signiﬁcantly
suppressed in prostate cancer
and suggests that stimulating
the growth of dendritic cells
is a promising area for future
research in prostate cancer

therapies. . -

Protein found to play A

" important role as molecular

‘switch’ in survival, demise
of dendritic cells

Pitt researchers have discov-
ered that a protein, cdc42, plays
an important role in the survival
of dendritic cells in cancer. Their
study showed that cdc42 was
upregulated in dendritic cells
treated with tumors, suppressing
their activity, and that dendritic
cells grew when the expression‘
of cdc42 was decreased.

The study further demon-
strated that dendritic cells treated
with tumors not only expressed
higher levels of cdc42, but

a cdc42 inhibitor (Rho—GD—1)
and 5.7—fold more of a cdc42
activator (ezrin).

“The discovery of an increas-
ing number of genes regulating
dendritic cell activity and a better
understanding of the molecular
interactions between immune
cells has provided the molecular
basis for specific approaches
of active immunotherapy in
cancer patients,” said l\/Iichael
Shurin, Pitt associate professor
of pathology and associate direc-
torofclinicalimmunopathology.
“This new direction, which
one could term ‘therapeutic
molecular immunopathology,’
will allow us to identify new
molecular targets in dendritic

cells and to possibly design‘

new therapeutic approaches for
cancer by genetically engineer-
ing the cells to protect them
from tumor-induced apoptosis.
This can translate into new

‘ possibilities for the creation

of highly efﬁcient vaccines for
cancer therapy.”

Study shows 
why heart
transplant
patients start-
smoking again

Nearly half of ex—smokers
who receive heart transplants
resume smoking at some point
after their life—saving operation,
and now researchers have good
evidence to suggest who is ‘at
risk of relapse.

Results of a Pitt studygpre-_,_

isenredrat 
and scientiﬁc sessions of the
International Society for Heart
and Lung Transplantation out-
line for the ﬁrst time the strongest
predictors for smoking relapse in
heart transplant patients.
Leading the list: ' a short
abstinence period before trans-
plantation, bouts of depression
or anxiety within a few months
of the transplant and a caregiver
who smokes. a
“Understanding which pa-

 

tients go back to smoking should .

help us design more effective

‘ intervention strategies to aggres-

sively target high—risk patients as
well as their caregivers,” reported
Carol Stilley, an assistant profes-
sor of ‘nursing and psychiatry

‘at Pitt’s schools of nursing and

medicine.

“Among the general popula-
tion, about 90 percent of those
who tryto quit will relapse within
a year, so in many ways our
transplant patients are showing
much greater willpower. Yet the
detrimental effects of smoking
depend on how much and for
how long someone smoked, and
in an immunosuppressed patient,
these detrimental effects’ are
likely to be much greater,” said
Mary Amanda Dew, professor
of psychiatry, psychology and
epidemiology, and the study’s
director.-

Drugs that transplant patients
take to prevent organ rejection
suppress their immune systems,
making these patients more
susceptible to infections and
cancers. A smoking history
and relapse; to smoking could
compound cancer risks for trans-
plant patients. In recent years,
transplant teams have seen more
of their heart transplant patients
develop inoperable lung tumors
— all previous smokers —~ four to
ﬁve years after their transplants.
Smoking reduces survival.

Studies conducted in Europe
have indicated a 37 percent
ﬁve—year survival rate for heart
transplant patients who smoke,
compared to an 80 "percent
survival for their nonsmoking
counterparts.

The Pitt researchers studied
202 heart transplant recipients
for up to three years. Of these,
144 (71 percent) had a history
of smoking, from two to more
than 95 pack years, a calculation
based on the number of packs
per day times the numberiof
years smoked.

Aspartofalongitudinal study
about health habits following
transplantation, the researchers
conducted in—depth interviews
with the patients, their family

I caregivers and the patients’

transplant nurse coordinators at
two, seven, 12 and 36 months
after transplantation. A
Fifty—ﬁve recipients (27 per-
cent of the sample of 202 par-
ticipants) started smoking at
some point after their transplant,
and of these recipients, 45 (82

percent) who started within two

.months. One patient who had

not previously been a smoker
{took up smoking an occasional
cigar. Throughout the three—year
period, 25 smoked .10 or fewer
cigarettes a day, nine smoked
between 11 and 19 a day, and
four smoked a pack or more
daily. The amount was unknown
for the remaining 11 who were
mostly cigar smokers.
Based on the series of inter-

‘ views, researchers also were able

to perform statistical analyses
indicating the strongest predic-
tors to smoking relapse. Patients
who quit smoking for a period of
less than six months before their
transplant (as opposed to those
who quit for longer periods of
time) were much more likely to
start smoking earlier and more
often. Depression and anxiety

within two months after the '

transplant also made it more
likely that relapse would occur
early, and these patients reported
smoking the most -—— more than
a half a pack a day. _ . _
Having a’. caregiver who
smokes was less‘ signiﬁcant but

. remained a strong predictor,

say the researchers. Of 194
caregivers who took part in the
study, 50 were smokers. Of the
55 recipients who ‘smoked, 21
had a smoking caregiver. I
