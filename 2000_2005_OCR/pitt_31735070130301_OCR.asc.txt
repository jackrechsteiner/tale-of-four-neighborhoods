_ The huge vinyl tent in the Cathedral of
Learning lawn isn’t for an arts and crafts show,
book sale or ordinary picnic lunch. Instead, the
tent will be used Saturday night to host 1,500
prominent alumni, donors and ﬁiends of Pitt as
they partake in an international buﬂ°et. ’

Following the buffet, the Cathedral will be
illuminated by a spectacular light show. -

The buffet is just part of the Discovery
Weekend, which begins Friday at 10 a.m. with a
presentation by Pitt alumnus Pat Croce, president
of the Philadelphia 76ers.

The mission of the Discovery Weekend is to

armounce Pitt’s Capital Campaign, which will .

attempt to raise $500 million for the University.
The invited guests —- mostly Pitt alumni -

have a full schedule for the weekend, including a

state of the university address by Chancellor

Music Hall which will combine theater, music,

“We want to thank the donors for their sup-
port and let them see ﬁrsthand what’s going on
here at Pitt,” Pitt Spokesman Ken Service said.

Service added that students will directly see
the impact of the donations; in terms of "endow-
ments for scholarships.

“We’d like to increase the number of schol-
arships by 50 percent,” Service said. “We’d also
like increase the nunmer of endowed chairs and
professorships. {This will allow the University to
continue to recruit and retain the best faculty.”

An institution invests endowment money
and uses the income to ftmd programs and schol-

arships.

At last night’s four—party debate and roundtable dis-
cussion, moderator Rehan Nasir referred to the six-
minute open discussion period as a “free-for-all.”

_ Each of the four parties represented by student
debaters —— the Greens, the Libertarians, the Democrats,
and the Republicans — were allowed one minute to
respond formally to each of four questions, followed by a
six—minute discussion period.

Comments during the “free-for-all” were often argu-
mentative, a result, many agreed, of the addition of the

‘ Green and Libertarian parties, which were not represent-

ed at the previous debate.

Nick Havens, president of the College Republicans,
agreed the debate was “more dynamic.”

‘‘[I] liked the heated discussion,” Libertarian debater
Bill Laboon said.

The ﬁrst question debaters faced washow their party
addresses the growing prison population.

Roxarm Favors and Jay Ver, representing the
Democrats answered ﬁrst, citing the prison system’s

“revolving door,” through which 80 percent of prisoners .

return after their release. Democrats stressed the impor-
tance of rehabilitation, making prisoners “productive

members of society.”

Greens, represented by Sam Cogan and Paul Cooley,
followed, promoting the legalization of marijuana and the
end of the drug war, which they say would lessen the
prison population in the United States.

Libertarians Matt Weiner and Laboon said the United
States has the highest per capital incarceration rate in the
world. They attributed this fact to the jailing of “non—vio-

nthe debate

lent drug offenders,” and called the war on drugs
“insane.” .

The "College Republicans, represented by Ed
Lepczyk and Kyle Slaughter, cited Gov. George W.
Bush’s endorsement by the Fraternal Order of Police as
evidence that the Republican party was up to the task of
decreasing the prison population. '

Gun control was the topic of the second question,
which the Greens answered ﬁrst. Cogan said the issue of

whether gun control infringed on Second_Amendment ‘

rights was not a hot one within the Green party. He said

0 they stress gun education, but that the ultimate decision

should be left to the local and county governments.

Weiner said that any gun control legislation would be
a “severe»violat:ion of the Second Amendment,” and pro-
posed a strict interpretation of the constitution, similar to
the Republican plan.

Republicans favored “limited, common-sense gun
laws,” saying though, that the second amendment is not
just about hunting guns.

Democrats proposed upping the waiting period to
purchase a gun to ﬁve days, in addition to instituting gun
safety tests among other things.

During the “free-for—all,” Cooley wondered aloud
whether gun-owning was a “macho” thing.

Staff Writer

Beginning today, Posvar Hall’s
ground-level lobby will become an exten-
sion of Pitt’s ID center.

Students can visit tables set up in
Posvar to pick up their new student
“Panther Cards” between 7:30 am. and
6:30 pm. Monday through Friday, today
through Nov. 22. .

According to Joseph Phillips, the vice
chairman at the office of budget and con-
troller, the University has redesigned stu-
dent DS in an effort to expand their use-
fulness and attractiveness.

The new IDs, known as Panther
Cards, rather than Pitt lDs, will feature a
graphic of a Panther head, against the yet-

to—be‘-constructed John M. and Gertrude’

E. Petersen Events Center.
The cards will
also have expiration
dates. Phillips said the ,
dates, which will dis-
play expected gradua-
tion dates _ for each
student, will ’ prevent
non—students from

cards for free or dis-
counted programs
through PitI Arts and
the University.

Mostly, however, the dates will be in place
to stop non—students from using old IDs to
ride Port Authority buses for free.

Students will have the opportunity to
have their pictures retaken when they pick
up their IDs, or at another date during the
spring term that is more convenient for
them, Phillips said. This is todiscourage
students from neglecting to pick up their
cards if they’re not feeling especially pho-
togenic on a given day. _

In addition to the new look, which
was designed by BSF Graphics, thenew
Panther Cards will be linked to PNC
Bank’s Student Plan, allowing students
with the plan to use their ID as an ATM
card as well. PittFunds will still be avail-
able on the card. The new ID will be
linked to an online enviromnent, making
electronic banking an option for students

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:

A comic strip that appeared in the Sept. 25, 2000 issue of The Pitt News
contained an unfortunate reference to The Original Hot Dog Shop. After
reviewing the cartoon, The Pitt News has concluded that the cartoon’s humor
missed its mark and exhibited poor taste. ' A

The Pitt News did not intend to create the impression of any unsanitary con-
dition at the ‘—‘O,”.:arid no reader should draw any inference along that line. We
know of no basis in fact for any unfavorable impression concerning The
Original__Hot ‘Dog “Shop. "The _‘ Pitt News regrets any possibility that a reader
might have mistaken the cartoon for anything other than a poorly conceived

The Pitt News has learned that the cartoon caused anguish for the owner of
The Original Hot'Dog Shop, Sidneyisimon, and his family. This is a particu-
larly sad point for us because Mr. Simon and his late wife, Esther, have long
been important contributors to the Oakland community. The Simons’ restaurant
has beena landfmark meeting place for students and the larger Pitt community
for 43 years.7We"va1ue’Tlie Original Hot Dog Shop’s contributions to our com--
munity, and we regret the pain this incident caused among members of the

The Pitt News apologizes to Sidney Simon, his entire family, and The
Original Hot Dog Shop for the lapse in judgement that permitted the cartoon to
be published. We are grateful for Mr. .Simon’s willingness to work with The Pitt
News to set the record straight. We hope —— and are sure '—— that the University
and Oakland communities will continue to hold The Original Hot Dog Shop in
the high esteem that has marked the “O’s” role in Oakland life for decades.

Correction:

In an Oct.l8 story entitled “Glass gallery promotes women artists,” Steve
Mendelson’s name was incorrectly spelled. Also, the name of Amy Morgan’s
glass show was inadvertently capitalized. The show’s name should appear

“for/about/by women.” The Pitt News regrets the errors.

Senior Staff Writer

Tom Weyant I told the Student
Government Board at last night’s meeting
that the student body views the board as
“petty and ineﬁ“ective.”

In a prepared statement, Weyant, co- S

chair of SGB’s public relations committee,
addressed a board comprised solely of men.

President Joan Snyder and President
Pro Tempore J o’ie Taylor, were both absent
due to other commitments. Board member
John Voinski presided over the meeting.

Weyant’s comments stemmed from the
results of the public relation committees
ﬁrst student forum to kick off SG ’s “What
Can We Do for You?” campaign.

.Weyant said that “some of the board

memberswere upset with the tum—out,” but .

that their complaints "were unfounded
because none of the board members volun-
teered to help with the forum
, He said that the board members ’ unwill-
ingness to help exempliﬁed their attitude
toward the student body.

“The board sits up in [the SGB] ofﬁce

and says ‘come to us if you have a problem,’ I

or ‘you didn’t ask me,’” he said

I Weyant also commented that the st11-
dents don’t know how to utilize SGB
because they don’t know who the members
of the board are or how to contact them.

He cited an example of a girl at the stu-
dent forum who asked, “Can we have SGB
show up at these forums so they can hear our
concerns?”

Weyant said the girl was sitting next to
Joan Snyder when she made the remark

To ﬁnish, Weyant implored the straight-
faced board members to take a proactive
stance in the lives of the student body.

When he ﬁnished, the audience and the

board members applauded him.

SGB presidential candidate Mike Guss
stood up and said, “I, too, View this as a con-
cern” ‘

Guss pledged -that if he is elected to
SGB, he will listen to. students’ comments
and concerns.

He ﬁnished, saying, “Stop the ﬁghting,
start working together.” =

Board member Jonathan Hoffman
admitted that he was bothered by Weyant’s
remarks.

“My personal stance is that I do go out.
I do listen, and I do try to get results,” he said.
“Everyone up here has their faults, but they
also try to help.” ~ I

Board member Mike Unangst said hei

felt that the members of SGB do make an
effort to communicate with the student body.

Unangst added after the meeting, “I
think it’s a Valid concern, but I think we also
need to realize that most board members
spend 25 hours a" week [in the oﬂice].” V

Unangst also said that SGB members
used to have office hours in the Towers and
in the downstairs of the Union, and that stu-

dents were more willing to approach SGB

members.

“It’s something we’ll deﬁnitely have to I

address,” he said.
“[Weyant’s remarks] were directed at all
of us for not doing our part,” Hoffman said.
Voinski disagreed. He felt the com-
ments were pointcd at one person,but that he_
did think the issue would be resolved.
Weyant responded to the comments
board members made during the meeting.
“The reason I did not point ﬁngers  is

I because it’s a problem that exists across the

board, [in all of the committeesl,” he said.

Weyant said that he too “felt hurt” when A

he heard the student forum’s comments.
“This just needs to be brought to every-
one’s attention,” he said. ' I ’

 

DEBATE

“It’s pretty sick,” he said.
The ﬁnal question asked the parties to
outline their speciﬁc policies regarding

FROM PAGE 1

changes in the way. natural resources

should be used.

Republicans proposed eliminating
“groundfrlls,” while the Democrats were
in favor of taxing oil and natural. gases in
order to reinvest in the conservation of
public lands. The Greens proposed phas-
ing out the use of all fossil fuels and
increasing methods of public transporta-
tion whﬂe forcing automobile manufac-
turers to produce vehicles that get 45 miles
to the gallonin gas. Libertarians proposed

increasing the use of nuclear power and I‘

called the fear of such an increase
“technophobia.”

Weiner also said the public should
“trust in the ingenuity capitalism breeds,”

letting people develop alternative energy _

sources in a “free and open market.”

The debate opened to audience ques-
tions relating to crime. and the environ-
ment after that. -

The Libertarians held that environ-
mentalism is a political agenda, and there-

’ fore should not be taught. Their platform

supports the abolition of public schoolsin
favor of private schools. » -

“It’s not agenda .., it’s a fact,” Cogan
said, on behalf of the Green party.

The ﬁnal audience question was how
to address white collar crime.

The Greens said their platform called
for “legislation with teeth.”

A Libertarian Weiner» responded,
“Incarceration of executives? Come on —
are there socialists here?”

The large proportion of Greens sup-
porters clapped and laughed.

The next debate between the organi-
zations will be held next week.

  OPINIONS

  EDITORIAL,
Get ready for your new,

VV1th the onset of the new mil-

lennium, it seems that everything is ..

being revamped, replaced and
reevaluated. Even that trusty piece
of plastic that allows you to access
PittFunds and get into your" resi-
dence hall is about to undergo a seri-
ous transformation.

Beginning today, you can pick
up your fresh, new Pitt ID on the

- ground ﬂoor of Posvar Hall. The IDs

are different in both appearance and

- the features they include.’

On the superficial level, the new
IDs are more aesthetically pleasing.
A head shot of your fine self will be
displayed against a gently ‘faded
image of the John M. and Gertrude
E. Petersen Events Center, while the
Pitt panther roars above the -scene.
Your new ID will read “University
of Pittsburgh Panther Car ,” in soft
gold lettering across the top.

1 Fortunately, the University had
the», foresight to attend to students’
vanity needs. When you pick up
your ID, you have the option of
keeping your old picture or having a

" new one taken on the spot.- But if you
' happen to pick up your ID at a

moment when you are not experi-
encing peak attractiveness, do not
fret; Pitt is providing everyone, with
one free retake. Therefore you can
still pick up -your ID on a day when

  somewhat improved Pitt ID

you don’t feel pretty and vogue for
the camera when you’re good and
ready. ~ _

’ Furthermore, yoiir Panther Card
will come with a special superpower
— as long as you havea checking
account with PNC Bank, you’ll be

able to use the card to access Cash at .

ATMs. . -

Sadly, this option really isn’t
that convenient for anyone. Those
students who don’t bank with PNC

are completely denied the ability to

use their IDs as“ATM cards. Even for
PNC customers, an extra ATM card
really isn’t all that handy. If Pitt and
PN C are going to go to the trouble to
provide this option," they might as
well strive to make it a check card, a
feature that more students would
truly ﬁnd convenient. .

I Finally, like yogurt and drivers’
licenses, the new IDs come with
expiration dates. This means that
you can’t scam Port Authority for
free bus rides after graduation or
continue to enjoy the host of other
beneﬁts that your Pitt education enti-
tles you to, such as complimentary
admission to Phipps Conservatory
and Pitt Arts events. VVith any luck,’
though, all Pitt students will get
rewarding yet high-paying jobs upon
graduating, so bus fares will be mere
drops in the proverbial bucket.

The mind for th bsent-minded

The other weekend I built a nest It was a bit-
terly cold Sunday, the heat wasn’t on in my house

bed, piled up my pillows and wrapped myself in
my cozy green sleeping bag. Nearby on the bed I
formed a stack of homework and study supplies

-— textbooks, binders, highlighters and those

brightly colored mini Post—It notes of which I am
ever so fond. Tucked safely inside my study nest,

‘ I was in academic heaven.

The only problem was that I kept losing

things. The minute I put.down my
highlighter, it was instantly and ELIZABETH

BOWEN

magically absorbed in the plush
folds of my sleeping bag. I tore
piece after piece of loose-leaf out of
mynotebook, each time forgetting
where I put ﬂie last. The baby Post—It’s, sneaky lit-
tle devils, were impossible to keep track of.

Slightly frustrated, I was once again con-
fronted with the realization that I am utterly, hope-
lessly absent—minded.

I would like to pretend that my absent-min —
edness is an unfortunate side effect of me being a
pure genius. I want to claim that my mind is over-
ﬂowing with important thoughts about morality,
chaos theory, complex mathematical formulas,
world peace and the recipe for cloning chimps,
and that I cannot be troubled with such mundane
ﬂiings as where I last put down my highlighter.

Iwish that were the case, but sadly that is not
true. Like most college students, my brain is ﬁlled
with thoughts of food, the opposite sex and acad-
emic matters when appropriate. It just so happens
ﬂiat a haze of pure spacey-ness pervades ﬂiese
shallow, un-genius cognitions.

Case in point: My roommates laughed con-

fusedly the other week when.they discovered a

solitary bagel placed atop a jar of peanut butter. I
recall getting the bagel out but  distract-
ed when‘ someone walked into the room. When I

Ol’lNl(’)NS EDl'l‘()R

that makes friends and family exc1aim,”Wow, it
looks like a tornado blew threw here!” when they
step in and gaze upon the rubble. Sadly I am not
one of those people whose room appears messy
but they really know exactly where everything is.
I arn.just a pure slob. Last weekend I was feeling
contemplative and wanted to light some candles,
but gave up on that idea when I couldn’t remem-
ber where I kept my matches.

My absent-mindedness has led to occasional
problems with my interpersonal relationships.
Some folks have trouble remember-
ing faces, some have trouble
remembering names; I have trouble
remembering people. Every day
people who I do not recognize say,
“hi” to me; I am never sure if they
are just friendly strangers or pwple I should know
but can’t recall meeting.

I am perhaps as bad as my friend Matt, who
has “met” my roomrriate Mandy at least three
times. Good-natured soul that he is, he continues
to say “Hi, I’m Matt. What’s your name?” when-
ever he sees her, apparently not remembering that
tl1ey’ve been through this ritual before. ‘

Over the years I have attempted to ﬁnd the
method to my mad forgetfulness. I used to think
that it was a manifestation of stress, as I seem to
be exceptionally out of it during rnid-terms and
ﬁnals. But I am no longer sure that this is true, as
my single most spacey moment occurred in the
summer, a period in which my free time is plen-
tiful and my worries are few.

It was a pleasant summer evening, and I
decided to go for a walk with my dear dog Pelle.
When I walk Pelle, I like to make it worthwhile;
we go far. So I had to make a few preparations. I
put on comfortable shoes, inserted fresh batteries
in my Walkman and chose a musical selection.
Grabbing Pelle’s leash I headed out the door.
Halfway down the driveway, I realized that I did-

“The Contender”
Directed by Rod Lurie

‘kit

ROBERT DITTMAN

Staff Writer

Navigating politics is like cleaning outhouses —
one can scrub endlessly but there is no way to ﬂush.

_ Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) ﬁnds this out the hard way

as she works her way through vice presidential conﬁr-

mation hearings in the new movie “The Contender,” a’

darkly ironic reference to one woman’s supposed
unsuitability to be the first female vice president of the
United States. ’

As the film opens, the V. P. to President Jackson
Evans (Jeff Bridges) is recently deceased. In the wan-

ing months of his administration, Johnson is
trying to leave a clean, heroic post- Clintonian
legacy. Several candidates for the job are
highly touted, highest proﬁle among them
Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), consid-
ered a clinch for the spot, especially consider-
ing his heroic, if ill—fated, attempt at saving a
woman trapped in a submerged car.

Unexpectedly, Evans nominates
Hanson, opening the ﬂoodgates for the conﬁr-
mation hearings from hell, presided over by
Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman),
who not only has another candidate in mind,
but also intensely dislikes Hanson.

Welcome to Washingtonian politics
—_—- take your seats and let the mud ﬂy.

Soon, Hanson’s obvious leadership
I qualiﬁcations take a back seat to vicious alle-
‘ gations regarding her sexual escapades during
college that may have gotten out of control.
For Hanson, it is a subject that will not go
away, despite her repeated argument that her
private life is no one’s business.

Director Rod Lurie treads on topical
ground and manages to hold our interest with
material that, while ﬁctional, is an
' unsettling mirror of fact. Lurie
wrote “Contender” with
Allen in mind and she

plays Hanson with a

sense of stalwart feisti-

ness, portraying a per-
son who will not back
down under withering
ﬁre.
Allen makes us forget we are
watching a movie — this could be any one of
us ﬁelding needlessly invasive questions.
Lurie’s script creates a bold candidate, one who is both
atheist and pro-gun control, when both subjects raise
hackles.

Bridges’ Johnson helps us to see the president
under fire in a human light — exploding in ﬁts of rage
without losing his presidential quality. A strong sup-
porting cast helps us to feel the ingrained, but seem-
ingly unavoidable, muckraking that is the way of polit-
ical life best known in but not conﬁned to Washington,
D. C. Screen veteran Oldman has had his share of
unsympathetic roles, this time as the scheming, politi-
cally driven chair of the conﬁrmation hearing. Oldman
gives a new meaning to the adage, “the end justiﬁes the
means.”

“The Contender” is a gutsy, if slightly ﬂawed, ﬁlm
that occasionally depends on lucky coincidences and
heroic speeches where logic would dictate otherwise.
In trying to humanize the doggedly persistent Hanson,
Lurie lets his ﬁlm bog down periodically but makes up
for it in the lighter parts. Weaknesses not withstanding,
“The Contender” should open the ﬂoodgates for other
political ﬁlms that scorn the idea of business as usual
and hiding behind cinematic stereotypes.

All in
family

Beginning last week, Wednesdays
belong to the Sheen family. From 9
to 10 p.m. Martin Sheen stars as

President Bartlett on “The West
- Wing” and from 9:30 to 10
’ p.m. Charlie Sheen stars as the
deputy mayor of New York,
Charlie Owens, on “Spin City.”
The fact that both play political

Eric Lidji characters is the most recent in a

line of Sheen role coincidences.

This kind of stuff keeps happening with this
family — for some reason they can’t stop playing the
same (or similar) characters. I thought long and hard,
and the following are the three best examples of
Sheen character similarities.

To start us off are the classic Vietnam War ﬁlms
both were in. In 1979 Martin played Capt. Benjamin
L. Willard in Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse
Now.” Martinfs character was sent to seek and
destroy a rebel commander who has been shooting
down his fellow Americans. Seven years later,
Charlie starred as Pvt. Chris Taylor, ayoung soldier
overwhelmed by the horrors of Vietnam, in Oliver
Stone’s “Platoon.”

Both played men on killing sprees —— Martin
played Kit Carruthers in Terrence Malick’s 1973
ﬁlm “Badlands.” In that he was a cowboy who,
along with his wife, traveled through the badlands of
Montana leaving behind a trail of victims. In 1986,
Charlie played Bo Richards in Penelope Spheer’s
ﬁlm “The Boys Next Door.” Bo and a friend take a
road trip after graduation that turns into a massacre.

They each tackled the world of conspiracies. In
1991 Martin narrated the ﬁlm “JFK,” directed by
Oliver Stone, about a lawyer who begins to uncover
the real circumstances surrounding the assassination
of President John Kennedy. Three years earlier, in
1988, Charlie played Hap Felsch in the John Sayles
ﬁlm “Eight Men Out,” about the 1919 Chicago
Black Sox scandal in which eight players were paid
to throw the World Series.

On a final note, who can forget the best of the
nine ﬁlms Martin and Charlie starred in together,
l987’s “Wall Street” directed by (who else) Oliver
Stone. It’s the one where Charlie plays Bud Fox, an
up-and—co1ning stockbroker who gets in a little too
deep, and Martin plays none other than Carl Fox, the
father.

Forget about Kevin Bacon — the Sheen family
might just spawn a whole new kind of parlour game.
So remember, when “One Degree of Separation”
becomes the next big hit, you heard it here first.

Two senses

“Visual Sound”

The Mattress Factory
Through July, 2001 '

WWW. mattress .OI' g

RYAN ANDERSON

Staff Writer

Installation art is set up to create an
atmosphere — art that is an environ-
ment. You can walk through it, some-
times inside it and every so often play
with it.

The Mattress Factory specializes in
installation art. Its current exhibition,
“Visual Sound,” is the first half of a two-
part series exploring the relationship
between sight and sound.

When you make the trek into the

North Side’s historic Mexican War,

Streets, you enter a very different world
from the rest of Pittsburgh. By the time
you set foot inthe first installation, a
production of a room from the Belgian
comic book “Tin Tin” by Frances
Patrice Carre, you have taken the first
step in the exploration of many new
worlds.

The artist has brought Tin Tin’s
world to life, and each person visiting
can play out the role in the comic book.
This piece had a very immature, recov-

ery-of-the-lost—world-of-
childhood feel, which gets
lost on grouches like me, but
seems to be all the rage with
most college students (fresh-
men girls moving in with
their teddy bears, and boys
with Transformers T-shirts).

Two rooms are created by
Takehisa Kosugi, a Japanese
artist who fuses electrical cur-
rent with lights and
speakers to create a
light/sound sym-
biosis. Kosugi
has set up two
connected rooms
that shine colored
lights that mirror
the rhythm of the

W’ electrical sounds. One room
has seats and within minutes
the sound and light show
becomes very soothing.

The two rooms by
Canadian Robin Minard work ‘ —
with stringed speakers that are stretched
between panes of Plexiglas, and draped
on the ﬂoor. The first room works with
natural light turned blue by the
Plexiglas, and is complete with fresh,
comfortable white carpet. The speakers
are about the size of a half—dollar piece
and look like ivy crawling up the win-
dows. They emit a strange electrical
toned-down hiss that combine together
to sound very natural and watery.

The second room has the same

speakers laid on the ﬂoor almost like -a
thick section of lily pads. These rooms
are amazing in the level of harmony
they generate between nature and sci-
ence, sight and sound, organic and syn-
thetic. .

The importance of the artist’s con-
trol of the entire environment carmot be
stressed enough. This is why installa-
tions at the Mattress Factory Work so
well. Art is contextual, and when the art
is forced into a museum it is often cor-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
        

_ rupted. Here the art deﬁnes itself, and -

the only intrusion is the visitor, free to
interpret and experience. If you have
been there before, then I say that the
Mattress Factory has added five new
installations that rival all their others.

If you haven’t been there yet, take a
few hours to explore the North Side, the
Mexican War Streets and, nestled on
Sampsonia Way, inside an industrial
relic of Pittsburgh’s former. life, a place

, you cannot experience anywhere else.

So many questions, so little time
for answers. In the middle of 44 shows m
55 days, the FENIXtx and New Found
Glory U.S.tour is stopping in Pittsburgh to
play at Club Laga tonight. Both bands will
be performing their version of modern
punk rock, and will be answering a lot of
their fans’ burning queries. .

After moving to San Diego, the band drew
the attention of Mark Hoppus of Blink 182.
Together with The Tahoe Agency, FENIXtx

_ After_converting to MCA and Drive-

on the Blink 182 and Bad Religion tour this
summer. The band also re-released their

Taking over on drums is Damon Depalaz,

guitar.
The reason for his removal is not exact-

mainly because Depalaz wanted to play

The No. 9 Pitt men’s soccer team
suffered two crushing losses this week-
end, both onthe road against Big East
rivals. The Panthers were shut out in
both matchups, first by Rutgers and
then by Villanova.

Rutgers 2, Pitt 0

The Panthers entered Friday
night’s game against the sub-.500
Scarlet Knights having only been
defeated once on the season. But Pitt
came out ﬂat and was unable to solve
the mystery of Rutgers’ goalkeeper
Ricky Zinter.

Rutgers opened the scoring 32:29
into the game, when Dustin Sheppard
put one past Pitt goalie Justin Gaul. It
was Sheppard’s ninth tally of the sea-
son, and David Boutilier and Josh Gros
picked up the assists.

The score remained close until the
80:37 mark, when Sheppard once again
found the net, putting the Scarlet
Knights up 2-0. Gros picked up his sec-
ond assist of the game, and Johan
Stausland picked up one as well.

Gaul made four saves in the game
and Pitt recorded 13 shots but were

making seven saves.

unable to provide any support. Ben
Garry and Spencer Barton led the way
with three shots apiece, and Peter Veltri
and Chad Porter each added two.
Rutgers was led by Sheppard who,
in addition to scoring two goals, had
nine shots on net. Overall, the team
recorded 16 shots. Zinter was perfect,

The win evened Rutgers’ recordiat
7-7-1 and 4-4-1 in the conference. Pitt
fell to 11-3 and 6-3 in the Big East.

Villanova 3, Pitt 0 -

The Pitt scoring drou-ght continued
against Villanova, as once again the
team was unable to find the net.

The Wildcats jumped out to the
early lead with a goal from Joe Carvolo
just under six minutes into the game.
Carvolo took’ a feed from the right side
from Tim Marciejak to put it past Gaul.
The scoring held off until thesecond
period, when goals from Joe Noonan
and Chris Edger put Villanova up 3-0

and the game out of reach for the
Panthers.

Gaul made just three saves’ on the
afternoon, while Villanova goalies
John Williams and Sean Teesdale com-
bined for nine saves and the shutout.
The Panthers outshot the Wildcats 19-
10, but struggled to get the ball into the

goal.
Garry, Porter, and Chris Churchill
each recorded three shots, and four
other players chipped in with two each.
In addition to their goals, Noonan and
Carvolo each had two shots for
Villanova, while Colin Raws and Jim
Curtin also added assists.

The victory improved Villanova to
5-7-2 and 2-5-2 in the Big East, while

Pitt fell to 11-4 and 6-4 in the confer- _

ence.

The Panthers will return to action,

Women’s soccer wraps up

season with win over Dukes

MATTHEW SCI-ILIESMAN

Staff Writer

From the look of the scene after Pitt’s 1-0 vic-
tory over Duquesne Sunday, you’d have thought
that Pitt head coach Roland Sturk just lead his
Women’s soccer team to a Big East championship.

He was mobbed by his girls, giving high ﬁves
to everyone around, and even received the tradi-
tional Gatorade bath that goes to a coach after a
big victory. But Sunday’s win was only the end-
ing note to a weekend series that resulted in a 2-1
loss to Syracuse on Friday and a unexpected 6-12-
1 record in the 2000 season.

“The biggest thing for us is we came in here
and hung together for better or for worse,” Sturk
said. “We didn’t have anything to play for but
ourselves.” . -

The Syracuse matchup was once again a
repeat of every other Big East contest the

Panthers participated in this year, lots of shots and
a couple of bad breaks. The Orangewomen came
into the matchup with a 11-6 record but had trou-
ble early on establishing any offense. They ﬁnal-
ly drew blood at the 37-minute mark when Erin
O’Grady dished a pass off to Jen Mena who post-
ed a goal past Pitt goalkeeper Rachel Brown.

Syracuse got their clinching goal .a minute"

and a half into the second half when senior Cindy
Wolf, in her ﬁnal home game, was awarded a
penalty kick and ‘then promptly cranked it past
Brown for a 2-0 lead. Jacqueline Fix made it a 2-
1 game at the 60-minute mark when she marked
up an unassisted goal, but Syracuse’s penalty kick
was too much for the Panthers to overcome.

Pitt was outshot 12-8, but held a 11-6 advan-
tage on comer kicks. Brown had three saves while
her counterpart, Katie Karlander, had four.

“Our games have been carbon copies because

Harris has plenty
to say about Vick

BRIAN GOLDMAN

Staff Writer

With the Pitt football team now 5-1, respect for the
team is growing. The Panthers are now ranked 27th. by the
Associated Press and 28th in the USA Today/ESPN
Coaches Poll..The respect was even more evident in the
turnout at head coach Walt Harris’ weekly press confer-
ence. .

“Looks like our press conference is building,” Harris
said. “More people are coming to hear about the
Panthers.” ‘ - i . ,' 6

For a change, there was no talk about Pittsburgh quar-
terbacks. Instead, the quarterback talk was all about
Virginia Tech’s Heisman Trophy candidate Michael Vick.

“[Virginia Tech has] the best player in the league, I
believe,” Harris said of Vick. ~

Vick is known as a superior athlete, Harris said. He is

Gametwo of the Subwa

,jA.lthough a number of baseball fans
were disgusted.by the idea of a Subway
Series, there’s certainly no way they could
be disappointed with what has unfolded so
far. .

The difference between the Yankees
being up 2-0 and the
Mets being up’ 2-0
could be a matter of
inches. Just ask Todd Zeile.

The Mets hurt them-
selves early in the first
game with mistakes on the
bases, for which there was
no excuse. A solid per-
formance from Al
Leiter was wasted, as it
has been so many times
this season. The prob-
lem was that the big.bats V . . .
of Mike Piazza and Edgardo Alfonzo were
quiet. They were unable to ﬁgure out Andy
Pettitte, who had a strong outing until he
got in trouble in the seventh inning.

Right now, the fact that Zeile is 4 for 9

  

so far in the series probably means nothing

to him. Instead, he is wondering why a lit-
tle bit of luck couldn’t have been on his
side. Had his ball left the yard, it could
have set up a big inning for the Mets and

. the chance to break the game wide open.

Instead, the Mets later held the slight
3-2 lead going into the bottom of the ninth.
Normally that means the game is over
when Armando Benitez trots in from the

bullpen.

Wrong. ’

I had a horrible feeling when Benitez
took the mound. It was the same feeling I
had in the second game of the National
League Divisional Series. And we all

know what happened then.

Benitez has not pitched well at all
recently, and has never had success
in the postseason. So was it a smart idea

to bring him into a one-run ball game?
Not really. '
Of course it’s easy to say that now, ‘but
seriously, the guy has not been any
good. ,

And then when Jose Vizcaino

came to the plate with bases loaded
and two out in the bottom of the
‘l2th, I had that horrible feeling
again. I knew that Vizcaino, who
probably had about four hits all season,
would be the ’one to ﬁnish off the Mets.
And of course he was.

One smart move that Valentine did
make was making Piazza the designated
hitter and letting Todd Pratt do the catch-
ing. Pratt is a much better catcher than
Piazza, who is also bothered by tendinitis
in his right knee. ' '

' Why Valentine didn’t keep that
arrangement for Game 2 is puzzling to me.
Having  Harris DH is not beneﬁcial
to the Mets, and it showed. '

But of course the big ‘hype about
Game 2 was the matchup of Roger

Clemens and Piazza. ,,

In case you’ve been living in a cave,
Clemens nailed Piazza in the head with a
pitch in a game on July 8 — an action
which certainly looked intentional.

‘And in the ﬁrst inning of Sunday
night’s game, Clemens continued to dis-
credit himself.

Piazza connected with a Clemens
pitch and his bat shattered into pieces, one
of which landed near Clemens. As Piazza
trotted down the line toward ﬁrst, Clemens
picked up the bat piece and threw it at
Piazza. ‘

All I could think of was how incredi-
bly immature and unprofessional this act
was.

It’s certainly easy for Clemens to get
away with such episodes, considering he
never has to take a turn at bat. That’s why
he was conveniently the starter for Game
2. Everyone knows that if he had to step up
to the plate at Shea Stadium, he would
promptly be knocked ﬂat on his fat ass_.

Mike Hampton was just not on for the
Mets. When you give up a home run to
Scott Brosius, you know you don’t have it.
Not even close. .

"When Hampton hit David Justice in
the bottom of the sixth, it was obviously
not intentional. If he was going to retaliate,
he would not have waited so long. He just
did not have control of his pitches, which
was obvious by his performance through-
out the entire night.

13
 

Of course the Mets had to make things
interesting in the ninth. Why is it that they
always get going at the end of the game?
Just a few innings too late guys.

Just when it seemed like the Amazin’s
were going to pull off another miracle,
Zeile once again comes within inches of a
home run.

Can he possibly get any more
unlucky?

Valentine should have pinch hit for
Harris when he came to bat with one out.
Harris is not much of a hitter and this was
a crucial situation when the Mets really
needed something to happen. There were
plenty of guys available, including Bubba
Trarnrnell, Darryl Hamilton, and Pratt. '

But what is even harder to believe is
that with two out and the tying run coming
to the plate in the form of Kurt Abbott, that
Valentine did not go to a pinch hitter then.

Abbott is a weak hitter. The Mets
were staging a miracle comeback,and in
this spot, needed someone who could hit
one out of the park. Abbott is not your
man. "

The scene will now shift to Flushing
and the series will likely only become
more intense. The Mets may be down but
they are certainly not out. It’s time to show
the world who really rules New York.

Karen Bielak is d columnist for The Pitt
News, and still stands by her prediction of
Mets in six.

HARRIS

in awe of Vick's ability to run and
pass the ball with great efficiency.

At quarterback, Vick is in every
single play and will force the Pitt
defense to be on their toes at all
times.

“I don’t think we have‘ ever

i ' FROM PACE 12

’ played against a player of that magni-

tude,” Harris said. “He has athletic
ability, quickness and strength, com-
petitiveness and he touches the ball
every down. We are going to have to
play position defense. We got to sur-
round him and chase the ball like

- we’ve never chased it before.”

Virginia Tech head coach Frank
Beamer is also excited about Vick. He
said that he enjoys coaching him and

watching Vick play on a day to day

' basis.

“He is very talented,” Beamer
said. “He has the ability to hurt you
every single play.”

A lot of the talk yesterday was
about the performance by Antonio
Bryant on Saturday against Boston
College. ~

Last year Bryant had his best per-

formance of the season against

Virginia Tech when he had 13 catches
for 215 yards.

That was his personal best show-
ing until Saturday, when his eight
catches ‘totalled 222 yards against
BC. ’

“He is athletic, and a tremendous
competitor,” Harris said.”He is a very
smart person and extremely competi-
tive. He has taken the game to anoth-

'er level and he understands what we

want done.” A 2 _
‘Harris reserved his highest praise
for the running game. Kevan Barlow
had 209 yards rushing, and in Harris’
mind, was the key to the victory.
“The most important thing is to
run the ball,” Harris said.
With Virginia Tech having one of
the best _ special teams units in the

country, the Panthers are going to t

have to step it up on special teams so
the Hokies don’t block punts or field

' goal attempts.

‘Harris knows about the Hokies’
special teams and wants to avoid get-
ting to fourth down.

“We thought about punting and
just converting every third down,”-
Harris said. “That would help a lot,
but I don’t know if Coach Beamer’s

guys would let us go along with that.”

Last year Pitt lost to Virginia
Tech 30-17 in Pitt Stadium. This
coming week Pitt looks for only its
second—ever win over Tech in eight
tries.

The game will start at 3:30 p.m.
and will be broadcast on - CBS-.
According to Beamer, Pitt is in the
driver’s seat. .

“Pitt is waiting for us,” Beamer
said. “They wore us out last year. We
were lucky to get out of there with a
win.”

 FROM PAGE 12

we’ve been in every match, but
we’ve either beaten ourselves, or the
referees have us, or we’ve just had
some bad luck,” Sturk said.‘ “You go
back and look and this was our 13th
one-goal game, several of those
games we’ve outshot the other team,
but the ball hasn’t fallen for us.” _

On Sunday Pitt honored its two ’

' senior players, ’ redshirt juniors
Cand_e Ruiz and Keeley Tobler,
before the game. Ruiz and Tobler are
seniors that can graduate in‘ the
spring, but are still contemplating
whether or not to go on into the busi-

ness world or return for theirfourth
year of eligibility. They will have
until the first of the new year to
make a decision according to Sturk.

“Both of them are pretty acade-
mic so they might go on to other
things,” St11rk said. “We hope they
stay.” _

‘ The only goal of the game came
at the 70-minute mark when Melissa
Smith found a ‘seam on the left. side
of the field and ripped toward the
net. She banked toward the center of
the goal and cranked a powerful kick
from 24 yards out past Duquesne_
goal keeper Kristin Scarphorn-

Pitt outshot the Dukes 18-8 and
held a 12-1 edge on comer kicks.
Scarphorn had 10 saves while

saves and Ross had one. ~
“We kept setting goals all season
long and we set one for the last four

games that we wanted to win two-
and get another shutout,” Sturk said.
-“I’m happy we stayed together as a
team and didn’t let adversity break
us up.” ' ’ -
The Panthers may have fallen
short on some of their expectations
this season, but the possibility of an
‘ entire starting lineup returning, all
with a year of Big East action under

ed recruits, ‘ has Sturk looking very
brightly at the road "ahead.
