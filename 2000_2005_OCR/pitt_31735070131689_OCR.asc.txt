Summer car crash

Power tools — especially those
that could speed up his many building
and repair jobs. Cold pizza for break-
fast in Venice. A Wandering alone
through the streets of European cities.
Building computers from scratch for
his friends, for free. Sailing, skiing and
cycling. Designing a machine to clear
away unstable housing developments
in an environmentally—friendly way.

Though Christian Bryan Jones did
not dedicate his life solely to any of
the things in that list, they are the
things that his family remembers about
him. Known to his family and friends
as Chris, the Pitt engineering student
died in a car accident just after rnid—
night on Thursday, Aug. 7.

He was driving home "from visiting
friends at a camp outside Philadelphia,
and wrecked when he swerved after
almost falling asleep at the wheel,

according to his friend, Brian White,
who was not in the car.

Another friend, who was riding in
the passenger seat, survived the acci-
dent.

At age 7, Chris learned to field-
strip and clean military weapons -
skills he picked up from soldiers

. returning from the first Gulf War while

he was traveling to Europe on a mili-
tary aircraft.

Through his father’s military ser-
vice, Chris’s family traveled overseas
about once a year. Over the past 15
years,‘ Chris and his older sister,
Carrie, clocked more hours in military
aircraft than many people in the mili-
tary, according to their father, Captain
G- Bryan Jones. '

_During his travels, Chris took
pride in learning about the transporta-
tion systems of the cities he visited.

He continued to feed his interest in

If you’re not happy with the results
of your investment in clothing, ‘elec-
tronic equipment or undercooked meat,
you can usually hopefor a refund.

If you’re not happy with the result
of your investment in a college educa-
tion, you’re probably out of luck. .

While there’s still no satisfaction
guarantee for college I students,

Congress recently enacted the Higher‘

Education Act, which has been dormant
1965, to hold universities
accountable for their graduates’ success.
By publishing testing scores and
encouraging parents to notice increas-
ing university tuitions, the Act seeks to
embarrass the schools with facts, as
there is not yet any legal or monetary
punishment. ‘ s
“This is all very new,” Barbara

Colleges held responsible

' Mellix, the assistant dean and director

of the College of Arts and Sciences, said
of the Higher Education Act. Mellix
added that more networking programs
and graduate services will allow for stu-
dents to be “ready upon graduation with
careersto pursue,” though she does not
believe the new programs are directly
related to the Act. '

Pitt’s new resources include net-
working systems and more personal
interaction -— especially with students
advising students. A

“Alumnet,” a computerized net-
working program recently improved by

developers at Yale University, serves as.

a line of contact between students and
500 fellow alumni. The program will be

getting around cities after he came to
Pitt.

“He readily took advantage of the
transit pass available to Pitt students
and seemed to have learned more
about Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County than many folks who had lived
their whole lives there,” Jones wrote,
recalling memories of his son.

Even at home in Philadelphia,
Chris found places to explore.

During lunch and after class in
high school, Chris and his friend,
White, would often venture through
crawl spaces and pipes leading to the
service basement beneath‘ the school.
When caught one day, school officials
accused the two of trying to plant
bombs beneath the school, White said.

They were actually exploring and
taking photos, he explained.

Before learning to care for
weapons from returning servicemen,
Chris learned to read and write from
his sister before he started school.
Chris, 19, had a close relationship with
his 22-year-old sister, who was one of
the most important people in his life,
according to his father, .

Chris and his father also spent a
good deal of time learning together,
working on building projects and per-
forming home repairs. p

“He also became so much more
skilled than I was, in almost every-
thing he undertook, that I often
became the overeducated helper,”
Jones wrote, describing his most
recently, completed project with Chris
—-— the reconstruction of the Victorian
front porch on their home outside
Philadelphia.

When not investing his time in a
building project or passing hours at the
Philadelphia Naval Base, where he
worked this summer, with the Naval
Sea Systems Command, Chris spent
time with friends in his third—ﬂoor

bedroom, watching movies and enjoy-

ing “general good times,” Jones wrote.

“He valued these i friendships
above most other things in his life,”
Jones added. “He would do anything
for his friends, and do it gladly.”

White described Chris’s dedica-
tion to friends, explaining that he was
always interested in other people and
spent most of his free time at friends’
houses‘.

Chris was well-liked, but “people
didn’t like him because what he did
was popular,” White said, describing
his‘ friend’s affinity for orange clothing
and thrift-store shopping.

“He made connections wherever
he went; he just had friends every-
where,” White added.

“Chris was always doing crazy
things,” White said, adding that Chris

had been planning to build a fireproof
suit, so he could light himself_ on fire
and jump into a pool at an end—of—sum—
mer party. - ‘

“He lived to build things. What I
know about carpentry, I learned from
him,” said White, who got to know
Chris in high school, when the two
spent hours in a crawlspace under a
stage, building theatre sets.

Religion was also important to
Chris, who was very active in his
youth group at church. He made three
mission trips to North Carolina and
West Virginia, where he repaired hous-
es for poor and disabled people. He
was planning another trip for 2004.

Pennsylvania and 200,000 worldwide,
according to Leland Patouillet, execu-
tive director of the Alumni Association.

In addition to the improved net-
working, which Patouillet considers
“most important” in job searching, he
called attention to “Graduation
Centra ,” a program that originated two
years ago to organize graduating stu-
dents picking up their caps and gowns.
Students can also sign up for an online
directory for alumni, exchange business

,cards and obtain information about

short-term medical insurance there.

Anthony Dicicco, 27,- graduated
from Pitt last December with a B.A. in
economics. “I spent literally hundreds
of hours, evenxdays,” Dicicco said of the
job search. His search began the August
before graduation and included visits to
career services

“But they weren’t much help at all,”
said Dicicco, who received career coun-
seling from them at least twice. “They
didn’t know of any companies outside
of the area.” 3

Local employment, said Dicicco,
was not available. g 1

“Going through Pitt just didn’t
help,” Dicicco said, ‘adding that he

I found his current job, working in cur-
‘ rency exchange for a boutique" firm in

Monterey Park, through family friends.

Not all Pitt graduates spend months
looking for work. Joan Snyder, who
served as Student Government Board
President in January 2000, began her
job as a neuroscience sales representa-
tive with Eli Lily within two weeks of
graduating from Pitt with a degree in

marketing the spring of 2001. Like

Dicicco, Snyder said she put “a lot of
hard work” in ﬁnding a job, but Snyder
came away from the experience with a
different opinion of Career Services and
the Alumni Association

“They are great services.” Snyder
said, adding that she had to do her own
networking research. “They aren’t

going to baby you —— you have to go out.

and do it yoursel .”

Snyder said she utilized counseling
sessions and job training sessions
through Career Services, but relied
heavily on direct networking - with
potential employers by repeatedly mak-

‘ ing phone calls, e-mailing and eventual-

ly ﬂying to at least ‘30 interviews in
cities from Atlanta to Boston.
According to the “Class of 2003
Preliminary Grad Report,” compiled by
Career Services representatives survey-
ing students at Graduation. Central, 50
percent or the- 349 students who
responded reported obtaining post-grad-
uation employment, with an average
overall yearly salary of $41,259.
Although nobody in Career
Services knew how many graduates

used their services before graduation,

Barbara Juliussen, director of Career
Services, reported there were more than
3,000 hour-long student appointments
and 1,880 walk-in appointments this
year. '

Pitt began a peer advising program last
September, where students trained by
Career Services help fellow undergrad-
uates through the registration process
and inform students of available ser-
vices.

For students interested in working
as engineers before they graduate, the
Cooperative Education ofﬁce, in B80
Benedum Hall, organizes a program for
students to spend a semester working

 

For those who have yet to graduate,

with professionals, followed by a sec-
ond semester of school. According to
Maureen Barcic, director of
Cooperative Education, about half of
Pitt’s engineering student body, or
between 500 and 600 students, partici-
pate.

The experience provides an oppor-

tunity for students to explore their _

intended careers before they make a
complete commitment.

Melissa Roos, who graduated in,

1993 with a B.A. in biology, thought it
would be easy to find a job. Instead, she
said she found she could work at a lab
and earn about $13,000 a year. '

Roos originally hoped to study pre-

Programs assist Pitt grads, but many still have trouble finding jobs

veterinary medicine, but after interning
at a clinic, she discovered she hated it.
Roos currently works as a manager at
Pet Supplies Plus in Bridgeville. ’

“I really don’t use any biology for
it,” she said, adding that if she could do
it over again, she probably wouldn’t

' have gone after a biology degree.”

But Mellix is hopeful that, by offer-
ing more opportunities for students to
work and communicate with profes-
sionals, more graduates will find well-
paying, satisfying jobs.

“Before the institution wasn’t inter-
ested,” she said of ﬁnding partnerships
for students. “The transition from col-
lege to a job really hits you in the face.”

Abercrombie’s “22” lawsuit frivolous

We are getting worried. Today is our
16th edition of the semester, meaning
that, in just a few days, we will be -pro—--
ducing our 22nd edition. Normally, we
would approach our 22nd day-iversary
without trepidation. We, as a paper, are
friendly to the number 22 — partial to it,
even, seeing that many on the staff will
turn 22 this year. —

But clothing retailer Abercrombie &
Fitch has thrown a monkey wrench in
our number—22 lovin’ ., The chain is suing
American Eagle Outfitters, another
clothing retailer, over American Eagle’s
use of the number 22.

Apparently, Abercrombie claims
that people associate 22 with Hollister
C0,, an Abercrombie-owned company
that started in 2000 and caters to a

, younger crowd than its parent chain.

Twenty—two refers to 1922, when
Hollister was fictitiously. founded,
according to the Aug. 26 edition of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

For those who associate the number
with, say, Dallas Cowboy Emmitt Smith,
Pitt football player Reggie Carter or the
product of two and 11, the fact that such
a numbercould be one company’s prop-
erty comes as a shock.
Abercrombie has not registered the num-
ber, nor is it the grand Pooh-Bah‘ of num-
bers. In fact, if we were to list number
Pooh-Bahs, Abercrombie would be
lucky to be in the top 22, er, 20.

It claims that, because Hollister T-

shirts had 22 printed on them before
American Eagle started printing shirts
with a variety of numbers, the latter
company is infringing on the rights of
the former. 1

So they started the legal version of a
stripper-ﬁght — a lawsuit.

Keep in mind that Abercrombie did 2

not invent the number 22. It is not
responsible for the creation of the
numeral ‘2’ or any of its permutations.
That credit belongs to whomever
invented the Arabic numeral system. It’s
possible that, if he knew it would prompt
such frivolous lawsuits, he might scrap
the whole thing and open a taco stand
only to be sued -for using the letter ‘a’,
clearly also Abercrombie’s property.
People havebecome accustomed to
frivolous lawsuits. “E pluribus unum”
narrowly beat out “when in doubt, sue,”

for what would be stamped on our cur-

rency. But this takes ridiculosity to a new
level. Abercrombie has no legal right to
the number, and ‘should sit down and
shut up. '

Since claiming numbers is now a
national trend — we are in the city that
Heinz 57 helped embiggen — The Pitt
Newsjwould, like to ofﬁcially plant its
flag in 1906. Any numbers containing
those esteemed digits are hereby proper-
ty of The Pitt News, at least until our
lawyer reminds us that newspapers, like
T-shirts, are not legally binding docu-
ments. «

Bush’s proposed malpractice awards not enoughto live on

Note: This column is the ﬁrst of a two
part series about health care reform.

Those around the nation who have
been increasingly unable to afford health-
care over the past few years should notice
that George W. Bush, along with other
Republicans, is trying to alleviate the
problem.

They should scrutinize Bush’s meth-
ods, but not his motives. A bill awaiting
the Senate’s consideration would, if
passed, limit awards for pain and suffer-
ing in medical malpractice cases to
$250,000. ' .

Doctors are having almost as much
trouble paying the increasing premiums
for malpractice insurance as their patients
are having paying for health insurance.
The former is one of the causes of the lat-
ter; in order to pay malpractice premiums,
doctors simply charge their patients more.

But many doctors ﬁnd their practices
less than viable, which has led to protests,
like a few here in Pennsylvania, where
doctors have picketed or closed their prac-
tices. On April 28, Philadelphia-area doc-
tors closed their practices, shrewdly call-
ing it a “protest” — it is illegal for doctors
to strike. And, according to a Feb. 19,
2003 article in the Arizona Daily Star,
“Doctors in Bisbee, Ariz., stopped deliv-
ering babies last year in response to a 500
percent increase in their premiums.”

Resultantly, Arizona resident Melinda
Sallard ended up giving birth to her child

‘ “tn'ckle—down” effect would be «

in her car, on the side of the road. The
nearest hospital was some 40 miles away,
according to the article.

Sallard is something of a poster child
for the Republican contingent supporting
the bill. She has been portrayed as the vic-
tim of rising malpractice costs.

The thinking, then, is that reducing
malpractice premiums will
result in lower doctor’s bills,
and, therefore, lower health
care costs for the nation as a
whole.

Right. To describe this as a

to make Bush seem
Reaganesque, which I’m com-
fortable with. This assumes
that doctors and insurance
providers, on the whole, don’t
want to make more money and would
gladly pass their savings down to the con-
sumer. I’m not comfortable assuming that.

Such an assumption is rash, and the
facts do not seem to bear out the conclu-
sion that Bush has drawn.

According to an article published

_ June 30 by U.S. News & World Report,

limits already been imposed in 19 states
“have failed to prevent increasing premi-
ums,” and “in states with caps [on ma]-
practice awards], malpractice premiums
actually grew faster than in nearly three

dozen states without them.”

This is not to say that such award lim-

its always exacerbate the problem — in
California, a cap equivalent to Bush’s plan
is in place, and, according’to a June 30
article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, mal-
practice premiums in Los Angeles are half
that of equivalent coverage in
Philadelphia. However, California also

has legislation limiting attomeys"fees for

malpractice cases.

Bush is on the right track
—— the issue of malpractice
expenses needs to be
addressed — but certainly
not this way.

Aside from the fact that
it simply won’t work, the
plan would be indiscrimi-
nate, punishing’ legitimate
.. claimants as much as it
. eliminated the effects of
“frivolous” lawsuits.

In "the case of Samuel Desiderio, for
instance, the punishment would be severe.

Desiderio was born with a congenital '

condition called hydrocephalus, an fail-
ment that necessitated the insertion of a
shunt to alleviate pressure on his brain. In
October 1990, shortly before his fourth
birthday, Desiderio underwent an opera-
tion at New York Hospital to restore the
shunt. The operation went awry, and
Desiderio suffered brain damage. He now
has a permanent tracheostomy, receives
food from a gastrostomy tube and suffers
from a disorder causing seizures that stop

his breathing. He must be resuscitated
after each seizure, which sometimes hap- ,
pens multiple times in a day. I

The defendants, Dr. Robert L. Ochs
and others, did not contest the charges of
malpractice, but later appealed the amount“
of the award.

The New York Court of Appeals
recently upheld the award given by a jury,
in which the jury estimated that medical
costs for Desiderio’s life span would total
$12 million in current U.S. dollars, and

some $50 million when inﬂation is taken ‘

into account.

This ﬁgure was calculated for an
expected life span of 55 years, 16 of
which have elapsed, meaning that, on
average, Desiderio’s would have $128
million per year for medical expenses —
not so much, when you consider that he
needs constant nursing care. _

That’s only, however, if one includes
the $4.5 million that Desiderio was
awarded for both past and future pain and
suffering. ‘

_ Situations like Desiderio’s provide
the most compelling reason why Bush’s
plan will not work, even if it succeeds in
reducing health care costs for the
American people.

If Marty Flaherty were deathly ill, he’d
pull the plug and pass the savings on to
you. How’s that for health care reform? E-

Clown Paintings: From the.Coi|ection
of Diane Keaton and Others

Through Oct. 26

Andy Warhol Museum

117 Sandusky St., North Side

(412) 237-8300

DAWN DIEHL
Staff Writer

It’s easier to offer a definitive statement on
clown painting at the Andy Warhol Museum than
it is to place clown painting in the context of
high art. ’ —

At Saturday’s opening of “Clown Paintings:
From the Collection of Diane Keaton and
Others,” one viewer remained skeptical, saying,
“I don’t know if this would be at the Warhol if it
weren’t for Diane Keaton.”

Another viewer, perhaps someone more
enthusiastic for the big—top ambiance, enjoying
the popcorn and snow cone cocktails, said,
“Clown paintings are an amplification of an
amplification. A clown is an actor in makeup
portraying an exaggeration of a human emotion.
A painting of a clown exaggerates it even fur-
ther.”

The kitsch of clown painting — an excep-
tionally garish form — is at home at the Warhol,
particularly as the last exhibit of “Summer of
Andy,” a series of programs in celebration of
Andy Warhol’s 75th birth-
day. By considering low
art what’s cheaply
manufactured, tacky, and,
more importantly, in
demand —— Andy Warhol
contributed to a more
complete picture of mod-
ern American culture.
Legend also has it that, at
the beginning of his
celebrity, Warhol would
sometimes ask staffers at
the Factory to stand in at
his appearances — even a
university lecture — in an
Andy Warhol costume: a
white wig, glasses and

makeup.

But both. Diane
Keaton, who owns 300
clown paintings, and
gallery owner Robert

Berman, who owns more
than 1,000 clown paint-
ings himself, have lofty
aspirations for clown art.
After realizing that their
competition to own clown
paintings had driven up

Berman met, discovered their shared passion for
clown art, and organized an exhibition of their
prized paintings at Berman’s gallery in Santa
Monica. Keaton assembled a book, “Clown
Paintings,” of clown painting reproductions and
essays from famous, funny people who mostly
don’t like clowns.

In “Clown Paintings,” Berman writes, “Even
the most awful clown paintings can convey

, depth and value.’’ And, according to Keaton,

“These rank amateurs’ [the painters’] dogged
attempts to put a stamp of personal expression
on the map links us to them.” '

This is sympathy art. It’s not good art
because it’s popular; it’s not bad art because it’s A
popular. It’s bad art because it’s not linked to us.

‘The painted emotions in the portraits are exag-

gerated and sentimental, not unlike the “more-is-
more” effect of reality television. A man who
comes home after losing his job at the "circus
does. not offer his loved ones a Big Frowny.
Because we are complicated and subtle beings,
carrying many simultaneous emotions, w.e can
relate to an ,artist’s representation of quiet des-
peration. .
Clowns aren’t linked to us. That’s probably»
why many people are afraid of them. They are
people removed from us, covered in a disguise.
In his essay from “Clown Paintings,” Chevy
Chase notes the “disparity between that huge,
painted grimace covering the lower half of his
face, and the small, inexpressive mouth lost in

prices in the Los Angeles
market, Keaton and

the grease —— but not lost on the confused child
who, at a glance, duly notices this inhumanity.
‘Who is this guy? What does he want?  Is he
really happy or is he angry and unbalanced? 
Where are the real people?’’’

So, why the fondness for clown paintings --
which are now sold as collector’s items on eBay
— in previous decades? Many of the works in
the exhibit were painted in the late 1940s and

is a duality of repression and emotion — an
image of a mask of joy or sorrow, or an actor
who paints his “true face” on as a release.

In conservative times ‘like the 1950s, an
image of a clown, cavorting or crying behind a
mask, could have appealed to the modern
woman living behind her own happy-“housewife
mask. Plastic proxy emotions in hyper clown
colors hanging on the parlor wall expressed oth-
erwise unfashionable nonconformity in a plastic
era; crying when she must smile, laughing when
she must be demure.

lar culture. Sometimes they act for good, such as
Jesus in “Godspell,” or for evil, as in the case of
the Joker from “Batman.” And then there’s the
ambivalent Ronald McDonald, who invites usto

cartoons and an exhibit examining the “projec—
tion” of Farrah Fawcett, is undoubtedly worth
seeing at the Warhol for the pop culture the

COURTESY or RCA RECORDS

Rockin’ refreshment

Youth & Young Manhood
Kings of Leon

RCA Records

aaaa

What rock needs is ‘a retum to the
sounds of the ‘70s — a refresher course on
what rock ‘I1’ roll used to sound like and
just how damn good it was. A young, fresh
rock band from ‘Memphis must agree with
that sentiment, as the debut album from
Kings of Leon, Youth & Young Manhood,
is a crash course for all those folks who
forgot what great rock ‘n’ roll sounds like.

Kings of Leon was formed by three
brothers — Nathan Followill on drums
and vocals, Caleb on vocals and guitar,
and Jared on bass — who got their musi-
cal education riding in the backseat of cars
and vans, and from thepulpit. Their dad, a
traveling Pentecostal minister, would let
them listen to The Rolling Stones and Neil
Young whenever their mother wasn’t
around to object.

Their father encouraged Caleb to play
the guitar and Nathan to play the drums,
and they would hone their skills playing
during church services. After settling
down in Memphis, their drive to play
music grew stronger, and they recruited
their first cousin, Matthew Followill, to
play lead guitar. _

VV1th the inﬂuences that they grew up
with, it’s only natural that that their 11-

song debut album sounds the way that it
does — bouncing drum beats instead of
banging, and smooth, airy guitar riffs that
ﬂow and produce the toe-tapping rock ‘n’
roll that has been lacking in music of late.

In February 2003, “Rolling Stone”
hailed Kings of Leon as one of the top
bands to watch in 2003, and this was after
hearing only the band’s f1ve—song ER
Holly Rollér Novocaine. Four of those ﬁve
songs made it to the full—length album,
with the addition of seven more, powerful,
guitar-driven tracks, Kings of Leon is def-
initely the band to watch this year.

Standout tracks include “Holly Roller
Novocaine,” “Molly’s Chambers” and
“Wasted Time,” all of which were on the
EP, as well as new tracks “Joe's Head,”
“Trani,” “Happy Alone” and “Spiral
Staircase.” '

This entire album is ﬁlled with incred-
ible songs blasting with emotion and blues
sounds mixed with garage-rock guitar
riffs. And this all coming from a band in
which only two members are of legal age
to drink — Nathan is 23 and Caleb is 21
—- one is just old enough to vote -
Matthew is 18 —— and Jared is just old
enough to get his leamer’s permit —— he’s
16 years old. ‘

But don’t let their ages fool you.
Kings of Leon play their songs with the
soul of a 50-year-old blues singer.

The TRL sensation that isn’trocks Metropol

Tonight, 8 p.m.

(412) 323-1919

Jason Mraz took _his sweet time creating
a buzz for himself. He didn’t pick up a guitar
until he was 18. His debut album, Waiting for
My Rocket to Come, came out last October,
and it took him the better part of a year to rise
enough in popularity to make it to TRL. One
might purport that it’s because Mraz doesn’t
produce music that teenyboppers can appre-
ciate. More  for funky coffee houses
than TRL, Mraz’s music traverses the frat-

boy—hippie genre.

Think John Mayer, Dave Matthews,
David Gray and Ari Hest. These are the kind
of live shows that are rave—wo1thy, not just
for the stellar performers they feature, but
also because they don’t need much more
than their bodies and guitars to captivate the
audience. . p h

C On Waiting for My Rocket to Come is
Mraz’s TRL hit, “The Remedy‘ (I Won’t
Wony),” a song about a friend who has
recovered from cancer. Not getting exces-
sively serious, the tune is a catchy mix of toe-
tapping percussion beats, some guitar chords
and, of course, Mraz’s coffeehouse vocals.’

“No Stopping Us”.has a funky, hippie-

vibe feel to it, while he sings each word
with passion and soul. And he has the
uncanny ability to get fairly ftmky without
losing the acoustic feel that is his music, as
on “Curbside Prophet,” his autobiographi-
cal tune. Background female rap vocals
rhyme things like, “Yo, that kid is crazy,”
and ‘‘What’s up with M-R—A—Z.” on the
tune. .

After studying performance and
musical theater in New York, it was time
to abandon the books and hit the streets.
Tonight, he hits our streets, as he performs
with Norwegian pop sensation Sondre
Lerche at Metropol in the Strip District.

So the ‘rents left, dropped you off
in Oakland about a week ago with
funds that, technically, should last
you at least until you return home on
Labor Day weekend. As we all know,
budgeting’ money can get difficult
when unexpected expenses like a
late-night trip to Fuel and Fuddle or
$5 bucks for a plastic cup at a "shady
South Oakland house party“ are
thrown in. ’

Fear not, Cheap is back!

This weekend, you can delight in

also as a preseason candidate for the

His best performance came against
Virginia Tech, who, at the time, had the
nation’s No. 1 rushing defense.
Miree ran for 161 yards, averaging
7.0 yards per carry, including a 53-yard

Panthers search for leadership, new goalkeeper

J OE/MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

No matter how well or poorly a collegiate sports
team performs, there is always a complete turnover of
the roster in the course of four or ﬁve years.

This off-season, the Pitt men’s soccer team learned
that the hard way. 9

After losing 10 seniors to graduation and adding 14
freshmen to a team that ﬁnished last season 8-9-1 and
missed the Big East Championships, head coach Joe
Luxbacher will be relying on a small group of experi-
enced players to try to lead his young team back to the
upper echelon of the Big East.

Pitt’s biggest question this season will center on the
goal, as Luxbacher tries to ﬁnd a replacement for four-
year starter Justin Gaul. , ’

Gaul, who was named Big East goalkeeper of the
week three times during his career, started every game
last year for the Panthers.

Battling for the starting spot are redshirt freshman»

to Luxbacher, either player is capable of stepping up
into the starting spot.

“It’s early in the season, so they’re both working
hard and they’re both very capable,” Luxbacher said.
“Typically, you don’t alternate goalkeepers, so they’re
both looking to come to the forefront. Both these guys
can do the job.”

“We train together and we push each other,” Cooke
said. “We’re making each other better. It's ultimately

the coaching staff that makes the decisions on what’s ~

best for the team.”

As for the’ guys in front of the goalkeeper,
Luxbacher feels the returning players are experienced
enough to help the younger players along. ’

“We have a solid core of returners,” Luxbacher
said. “We don’t have a large one, in terms of numbers,
[but] they’re all solid guys and key guys.”

Among that core group of players is defenseman
Clay Haﬂich, the team’s captain and only senior.

Having started all 18 games last season, Haﬂich
enters this season having played in 53 straight games.

J ason’ Cooke and sophomore Justin Lowery. A_ccor_ding.  A. _Haf_lich ,helpedggFfit_t’V_sgdefen<se record seven shutouts

last season, and his only goal of the year proved to be
the game winner in a 3-0 victory over Cleveland State.

Gone from last year’s defense are Miles Dowiak
and Josh Whitham, both of whom started all 18 games
last season, along with Toure Weaver and Mike Doe. «

Replacing them will be freshmen Zamahir
Campos, Brendon Gardner and Jonathan Lauchner.

While he doesn’t expect them to lead the team right
away, Luxbacher does expect them to contribute.

“We have a good freshman class,” he said.
“Definitely, we’re looking for some of those guys to
contribute signiﬁcantly. However, we see them doing
that_around our core of returners.” .

On theoffensive side of the ball, the Panthers’ top
two scorers from last season return.

Junior midﬁelder Marco Canizales —- who led Pitt
in goals (eight), points (16), game—winning goals
(three) and shots (40) in 2002 — returns, along with
sophomore forward Keeyan Young, who was second on
the team, with ﬁve goals and 13 points.

V Barkley). ~ i

Sampras deserves credit for accomplishments on the court

Pete Sampras retired from the
sport of tennis Monday, ending a
career that spanned three decades.
During that time, Sampras set the all-
time record for men’s Grand Slam
titles, with 14, and finished the season

‘ as the No. 1 player in the world a

staggering six straight years, /from
1993 to 1998. With the exception of
his inability to _win the French Open
on the clay courts of Roland Garros,
Sampras had a blemish-free career
that will most likely never be dupli-
cated. 1 -

And nobody cares. '

Why? .

Because Pete Sampras is bland.

Like most pop culture phenome-
na, America likes its athletes to be
larger thanhlife. Long-touted concepts
of work ethic and technical prowess
have gone the way of the Pokemon
card. The American sports fan wor-
ships the charisma of a Muhammad
Ali, the brashness and instability of a
Mike Tyson,and the spectacle and
self—promotion of a Terrell Owens.

All ‘that Sampras ever did was
pick away at his tennis-strings, stick
his tongue out in a confused manner
and dominate his sport the way no
other athlete has ever done. ‘

More than ever, sport is marketed
for its entertainment Value. Selling
tickets and merchandise is the main
motivation of promoters, owners and
administrators of sport, and the so-
called “Y Generation” likes its prod-
uct flashy and quick, like at video
game. Market value in the sporting
world supercedes athletic value. To be
promoted as an icon, an athlete has to
either have freakish athletic ability
(Michael Jordan, Michael Vick),
unique physical characteristics
(Dennis Rodman, Yao Ming), or an
intriguing personality (Tyson, Charles

Sampras had none of these. He
was an average-sized man who played

» a now—antiquated serVe—and-volley

style and never ‘said too much, on or
off the court. . V

"Even within his "own sport,
Sampras’ popularity was far exceeded
by several of his peers. Sampras did-

n’t have the emotion or charisma of «

Andre Agassi, who was, by ‘far, the
most popular American tennis player
of the ‘90s and ’ Sampras’ biggest
rival. He didn’t have the love of fans
like Boris Becker did, and he never

ls displayed the fiery, fist—pumping,

win—or-die attitude of Jim Courier.
As a tennis fan in the mid-‘90s, I
never heard anybody say that Pete
Sampras was his or her favorite play-
er,'even though he routinely dominat-
ed the three men listed above, en

_ route to losing only’ oneimatchg at

imbledon in (eight years. He was

just so  boring.
Further weakening Sampras’ star-
dom is the general deterioration -of

 

men’s tennis over the last five years.
As is the case with baseball, the tech-

nology in tennis has so greatly
impro_ved that it has compromised the
integrity of the game and hurtits pop-
ularity. Huge service winners with
lightweight aluminum rackets have
replaced the long, exciting rallies that
are common in the women’s game.
The retirement of Becker and the
. aging of Sampras and Agassi have left
the men’s tour with some huge shoes
to fill, and ratings for men’s tennis
have steadily decreased with its
inability to create new stars.
This leads me to one question: in
a world dominated by popular culture,
does winning even matter in sports

anymore? . A

Certainly, some of the athletes
listed above were praised for their
abilities to contribute to winning
teams. Jordan won six National
Basketball Association titles, and
Rodman won five. But winning does
not account for the fact that Anna
Kournikova, who has never won a
singles title but has the looks of a
model, has created more buzz in the
tennis world over the last five years
than Sampras. Nor does winning
account for the fact that the Kobe
Bryant sex scandal, which hasn’t even
