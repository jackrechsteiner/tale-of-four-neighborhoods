A Making the most of an abnormally warm autumn

WES BRYANT/PH00 EDITOR

According to Accuweather, the high temperature in Allegheny County yesterday was 58 degrees. '
According to Charlie Patterson, a Woodland Hills High School sophomore, that’s perfect weather for
jumping a bike on the Cathedral lawn in shorts and a T-shirt. . .

Artexhibit acts
as therapy, too

LAUREN UNGER
‘Staff Writer

John couldn’t stay within the lines. At 46, he would scribble
uncontrollably, creating pictures that reﬂected the mental develop-
ment of a 3-year-old.

His concentration level in art was mimicked in his social inter-
actions as John had trouble focusing on one task and would wander
out of his assigned area .

It was around this time that he began working in the art thera-
py program atgthe Arc Westmoreland 4- formerly the Association
of Retarded Citizens _—— which provides a number of services
including housing, therapy and vocational training for mentally
challenged individuals of all ages.

After spending time in the art therapy program, John’s concen-
tration slowly improved. He colored in smaller and smaller set
frames until_he could stay within a small area without coloring out-
side of the lines. Eventually he was given a circular frame and now
he can identify and draw a circle, representing his greatly improved
comprehension. I.-Iis social skills also improved during the therapy.

The artwork of clients 4 like John —— of the Arc
Westmoreland art therapy program is on display in the William Pitt
Union’s' Conney M. Kimbo Gallery. The exhibit, titled “Eclectic
Voices: Speaking a Visual Language,” runs through Dec. 8.

Bright colors and large splashes of Tempera paint dominate the‘

paintings, which are neatly flamed. The Pitt Program Council arts

director, Lisa Nguyen, solicited the exhibit. ,

Nguyen said she was inspired by a television commercial to

research an exhibit dealing with mentally challenged art therapy.
“['Ihe exhibit is_] a great way to show that people may be men- _

tally challenged, but they can do wonderful things,” Nguyen said.
J eﬂ° Guy, one of the art therapists who created the program, also

cites a larger message behind the art. “The exhibit helps to form a

common bond [between the public and mentally challenged peo-

’ ple],” Guysaid. “It breaks down the stigmas some people have

UPMC docs work to identify
possible heart failure triggers

RYAN MCLIMANS
Staff Writer

In an endeavor to locate the causes of

. congestive heart failure, a disease that each

year claims half of its 5 million victims, a
cardiology lab full of genetic researchers
examines microscopic strands of DNA as
Medivac helicopters buzz by and cold winds
howl at their window high atop UPMC’s
Biomedical Science Tower.

Recognized as a center of excellence in
gene study, the lab’s goal is to understand the
biochemical changes that occur during heart
failure and to develop methods of identify-
ing the speciﬁc trigger of the disease.

“Patients suifering from heart failure
experience a progressive decline in their
health possessing this disease with a mortal-
ity rate that is as bad as many cancers,” said
Dr. Charles McT1ernan, the lab’s director
and a professor of genetic studies at Pitt’s
School of Medicine. ' '

Aperson with congestive heart failure is

' recognized as having signiﬁcant deteriora-
tion in the function of their heart accompa- 4

tried by scarring of the heart muscle, making
it susceptible to malfunction. A bad diet,

. viral infection, high blood pressure, extreme

stress and a family history are among the
many factors that lead to a person develop-
ing heart failure. . ‘ .

‘The problem is many people don’t

_ know they are_ having difﬁculty retaining

normal heart‘ function,’’, Mc'I'1eman said.

. “Iheirhearts  benmning at only 50 per- i

cent capacity while other people around
them are rrmning at 90 percent, and then they
dash for the «bus or run up some stairs and

they end up extremely out of breath and in

the doctor’s oﬁice.”

McT1ernan said it’s always easier to pre— _

vent a disease than it isto repair it, but
because most of the cases of heart failure
consist of people who have advanced symp-
toms, the lab is focused on developing ways
to preserve and repair damaged muscle tis-
sue in the heart with therapeutic intervention.

VV1th transgenic technology, which is
the use of animals that genetically replicate
human diseases, researchers discovered that
the gene most responsible for the muscle
scarring and heart failure is TNF—Alpha.
TNF-Alpha causes the heart muscle _to

become larger and interfere with the heart’s .

ability to pump and feed needy organs and

systems with blood.  was discovered ‘L

with the creation of the tran' " sgeiuc‘ mouse. 
Transgenic mice are born with the

human replicated DNA strandspthat were “

created‘ ‘by researchers in Mc'I'1eman’s lab
and exhibit abnormal heart patterns associat-
ed with congestive heart failure in humans.
The mice have become an important
tool in developing two methods of treatment
for heart failure: an antibiotic, soluble recep-
tor and an intravenous injection. According
to McT1ernan, the soluble receptor is intro-

,/duced to the mice and links up with cells in
' the body “like a key through a. door lock”

Mariah Preston boarded a Greyhound
bus in Boston Thursday evening and
attempted to sleep as she made the long trek
to Pittsburgh. She canre to Pitt to attend the
Graduate_School of Public and International
Atfairs’ Open House for prospective stu-
dents on Friday.

Preston was among the many studerits
from all over the nation and the world who
came to Pitt to see what GSPIA had to oifer
at its open house Friday, held in Posvar Hall.

Barbara Porter, Pitt’s assistant dean of
student services, said organizers of the open
house hoped to attract students who want to
change the world. Students with that goal in

' mind have come from around the world to

attend this nationally recognized program.
It is GSPIA’s cosmopolitan student
body, Porter said, consisting of 25 to 30 per-
cent international students creating an inter-
national classroom perspective, which sets
Pitt’s program apart from others. ’
In addition to the intemational perspec-

tive, Sue Scheeren, the director of external ’

relations, said she feels GSPIA is so high]

      GSPIA hosts open house

recognized because’ its  size creates an
intimate student-faculty ratio. Professors
here are friendly and helpﬁil, she said.

Jessica Hatlrerill of Pittsburgh did her
undergraduate work at Pitt She explained
that one of the reasons she chose‘GSPIA is
that students and faculty “are helping each
other out. It’s not a rat race.”

According to Bryan Marcus, a second-
year international affairs major ﬁom
Alabama, many of the currently enrolled stu-
dents at the open house wanted to impart the
message to perspective students that people
are ambitious and driven, but they channel it
into a commitment to help. _

Andrea -Foessel, originally from Chile,
said she is studying public administration
and environmental management with hopes
to return to Chile to initiate change there.
Foessel said the southern part of Chile —. an

- area where rainforests thrive —— is being dev-

astated by timber companies. She hopes to
return with the educational backing to regu-
late logging and prevent deforestation.
Porter said the open house seemed" to
attract the type of students it is looking for —+

as she put it, “students [who] have a person-

al mission.’.’~ v - . .

In the wrong hands, data can be dangerous, speaker says

Privacy, page 1

, She also cited rumors of credit card
tweaking in Maryland, where a. credit card
company allegedly reduced the credit limit
of a terminally ill man after discovering
his condition. A »

Sweeney said the problem arises fro
a failure to comprehend the difference
between “de-identiﬁed” and “anonymous”
data. She said that when policymakers
and authorities arrange for the release of
data to researchers and marketers, they
sometimes mistakenly believe that by
removing a name or other explicit infor-
mation, they make it impossible to identi-
fy someone. .

It has to do with uniqueness, Sweeney
said, citing _the example of Cambridge,
Mass. According to Sweeney, only 12 per-
cent of the residents have unique birthdays
that would "allow them to be identiﬁed
immediately. But with the combination of
a birth date and ZIP code, that percentage
of unique instances jumps to 69 percent,
Sweeney said. Add to that the full postal

code — another four digits to the ZIP code V

— and the number of individual and
unique combinations increases to 97 per-
cent.

The U.S. government lags behind
European nations and Canada in the area
of data privacy, Sweeney said. According
to her, Canadian privacy law allows for the
immediate blockage of data sources that
are proven to be re-identiﬁable. U.S. law
has a similar rule, but makes it more difﬁ-
cult to protect privacy by requiring proof

that the loss of anonymity has a harmful
effect. - '

While most of the data that can be
used to re-identify people has always been

_ available as part of the public record, start-

ing in approximately 1996, the prolifera-
tion of cheap computers with large storage
capabilities has led to an explosion in data
collection, according to Sweeney.

Sweeney said electronic birth certiﬁ- \

cates in California now include more ‘than
226 individual pieces of information, up
from the approximately 50 before.«They

form part of the public record available to A
everyone and already include items such.

.as mother—-’s maiden name, which credit

card agencies sometimes use as pass-
words, history of alcoholism and prelimi-
nary intelligence tests of children.
According to Sweeney, another rea-
son for the massive increase in personal
information stored by govemment agen-
cies and private organizations is the atti-
tude that information can solve problems.
“If we have a problem, the answer’s
easy. Just collect more data,” Sweeney
said. ,
Sweeney said when government
agencies decided to investigate why the
cost of health care rises, they began to col-
lect hospital discharge data. The records,
she said, include diagnosis codes and

demographic information.

When a hospital releases information,
it generally does not contain names or
Social Security numbers, but she said data
detectives can apply re-identiﬁcation tech-
niques to the de-identiﬁed information in
order to link it to a speciﬁc person.

According to Sweeney, data is not
always used in a negative way. She said
researchers rely on data to research envi-
ronmental safety issues, such as cancer
frequency and health epidemics. Sweeney
also said government agencies are using
data analysis to track thethreat of bioter—
rorism.

But the ﬁeld of data privacy is. work-
ing to ﬁnd computational solutions, that

would remove enough information to
make it impossible to re-identify individu-
als without distorting it so much as to lose
its research value, Sweeney said. Such
solutions include removing single digits
from ZIP codes, providing only a birth
year or eliminating references to gender or
race, depending on researchers’ needs.
Apart from paying out of pocket for
such items as hospital bills and not partic-
ipating in discount shopping programs that
track purchases, such as Giant Eagle’s
Advantage card, Sweeney said there is lit-
tle an individual can do to protect his or
herprivacy.
~ ‘Some of these problems have to be
solved on the larger scale,” she said.

Pitt takes dangerous first step in
erosion of academic freedom

Imagine that you’re interning some-
where and suddenly you’re told the
University will no longer support you. Why?
Someone in Harrisburg didn’t like what you
were doing.

It’s already happened to
Environmental Law Clinic.

Like internships, law clinics are ways
for students to gain practical experience
while working for a cause. Pitt Law School
houses ﬁve clinics, which represent those
who Couldn’t otherwise afford lawyers.

The Environmental Law Clinic agreed
to help groups opposing logging in the
Allegheny National Forest and the proposed
Mon-Fayette Expressway.

Because of certain legislators’ ire at
these causes, the legislature ordered the
University not to use any state ftmds for the
clinic. University Spokesman Robert Hill
told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that it was
impossible to distinguish state ftmds —
which constitute $180 million of Pitt’s $1
billion-plus budget — ﬁom other funds. As
such, the University simply cut off its fund-
ing of the clinic and billed it $62,559 for
administrative and overhead costs ﬁom the
year before. .

, Wrlliarn Luneburg, the director of the
environmental law program at the law
school, said this could force the clinic to shut

the

down» within two years. V -

$62,559 out of a budget of more than $1
billion is but a drop in the bucket of the
University’s coffers. The University has a
large accounting department — is it impos-
sible to ﬁgure out what money comes from
the state and what does not? After all, state
money from year to year typically represents
only one-ﬁfth of the University’s ﬁmding.
Couldn’t the University ﬁmd the clinic with
money that does not come from the state?

Yet, the University administration refus-
es to take a stand to defend its professors’
academic freedom. ‘

The Environmental Law Clir1ic’s possi-
ble demise, and Pitt’s refusal to stop it, could
be a ﬁrst step in eroding academic freedom.
The University is also selling out its students.

Ifthe administration is willing to cave to
legislative pressure this time, no one lmows
what would be next What if some legislator
didn’t like something the American Civil
Liberties Union did and threatened to cut off

Patriotism the latest commercial fad this holiday

This year’s holiday colors are red,
white and blue.

maybe the store can award a limited-
edition ﬂag stand with purchases of
$100 or more, just like the

Walking around
Downtown, you can see
just about every storefront
ready for -Christmas. But
while the companies’
favorite color - green — still
weighs heavily on their
minds, you might be seeing
less of the traditional holi-
day hues than usual.

Patriotism has become
the biggest marketing ploy

handbags that you get with
make-up purchases.
Stores have already
mercilessly commercial-
ized Christmas — now
they’re after patriotism. In
the months since the Sept.
11 attacks, nationalism has
become the new chic.
Businesses seem engaged
in a battle to plaster more

since the creation of
Mother’s Day, and businesses are los-
ing no time in capitalizing on it.

I’m anticipating the arrival of the
holiday catalogs. I can already imagine
what they’ll say. “Love your country,
shop at [insert store here],” followed
by a nice tagline like, “You owe it to
your nation.” A picture of a gleeful
child — reverently waving an American
flag while sporting the latest red, white
and blue holiday garb — might accom-

pany the slogan. As an added gimmick,

American ﬂags on their
logos and billboards than the competi-
tion, as if to show that they love
America more than the next corpora-
tion. NBC has ﬁlled the clear peacock
it places on the bottom of the screen in
its programs with stars and stripes.
Less subdued ads have become a bar-
rage of red, white and blue lights. A
recent Saturn commercial even sug-
gested that this is “the perfect time to
buy a new car.”

I’m not criticizing those who have

 

taken to displaying the ﬂag out of gen-
uine pride. At worst, our nation’s new-
found affinity for ﬂag-print neckties,
jewelry and clothing is a little corny.

But when worn proudly, the sincerity V

outweighs the silliness.

In a capitalist society hinged on
supply and demand, we can’t condemn‘
a store for responding to consumers’
patriotic cravings for tacky, ﬂag-fes-
tooned merchandise. ‘But companies
should not exploit the ﬂag to make a
proﬁt. Lately, we’ve been bombarded
with the message that to support our
country we must spend money. Many
banks now display posters reminding
us of our national duty to put our
finances in their hands.

Patriotism is a tremendously
strong sentiment, and it’s unfair for
businesses to take advantage of its
power of patriotism over people.
America will not ﬂourish if we
become a nation of patriotic debtors.

I ﬁnd .it difﬁcult to believe that
Uncle Sam will love me more if I
deposit all of my money at the

Waterfront instead of in the stock mar-
ket. But the government only encour-
ages the companies’ behavior by
reminding us that economic stability
depends on our shopping expenditures.

In the past months, the president

and top government officials have .

reminded us that it is our duty to spend
money and keep the economy going.
To a certain extent this is valid — the
last thing that our economy needs is
for people to panic and pull out on all
of their investments. A strong economy
requires consumer confidence.

But we don’t owe it to the country
to overspend this Christmas. We
should be encouraged to go on with
our lives as we did before the attack.
We should not be told that it’s our
patriotic duty to shop or to spend more
than ever before.

will be conserving her money as tight-
ly as ever this season. Reach her at

Not leaving after all:

‘One Eye’ not reﬂective of BAS

On Friday, Nov. 9, we, the Black Action
Society, held our armual talent show. Participation
in this event was open to all individuals who
wished to stage an act. This year’s show featured
positive and talented acts such as vocal and instru-
mental presentations, hip-hop, a dramatic reading,
performance poetry and dance.

But the last perfonner, a comic who goes by
the stage name of “One Eye,” took the program on
an unfortunate turn. He began his set with several
insensitive comments regarding the Sept. 11 terror-
ist attacks and anthrax.

BAS does not, nor did we ever, support the
statements made by “One Eye” that night. At both
the talent show’s audition and dress rehearsal, pro-
ceedings at which his content was reviewed, he
made no such remarks. When he went into his
improvised routine at the actual event, we were just
as shocked as everyone else was, and he was
promptly removed from the stage.

While we respect the feelings of those who
were traumatized by “One Eye,” BAS does not
assume accountability for his ideas. We allowed
him to participate in a contest that was open and
indiscriminate to anyone interested, so long as his
or her act was assessed for inappropriate material
beforehand. The impromptu remarks made by
“One Eye” when he got on stage went beyond our
control, and his views on the Sept. 11 attacks do not
in any represent those of BAS. Our sincere sympa-
thies are with those who lost loved ones in the
tragedy.

Jesus would protest the war

I just read the Nov. 12 article in the Pitt News,

.“War Protest Draws More Than 300.” By all

accounts, this would seem to be a success. Despite
the fact that I might draw a little ﬁre, I can’t help but
wonder why there were so few people at such an
important protest. People’s emotions run high at
times like these and it doesn’t come as a surprise
that those in support of our actions in Afghanistan
are in the majority here on campus, assuming
Bethany Sarnuels (“We’re representing the patriotic
majority on campus”) is indeed correct?

There is another majority here on campus:
Those who identify themselves as Christians. I’m
not a Christian, but I’ve studied the religion exten-
sively. The Bible is very clear on the act of killing
others: “Thou shalt not...” Jesus was very clear on
the act of violence: “...Tum the other cheek.” God
does not say, “Thou shalt not kill (unless you’re
convinced that you’re killing a bad guy).” God just
says not to do it.

It’s very diﬂicult being a Christian. But if you
consider yourself a Christian, you’d be hard-pressed
to ﬁnd a better place to be than at the next war
protest Religion is about faith. Have some faith that
your God knows what he’s doing. And if you have
a faith other than Christianity, see what your faith
says aboutkilling. I bet it will be pretty clear.

It takes one hell of a lot of moral fortitude to be
peaceful in such times. But if you’ve got a question
as to what you should do, ask yourself, “What
would Jesus do?” I bet he wouldn’t send in
bombers.

late 20th century. At least, not yet.

But you can ﬁnd a play about her
predecessor, Jacqueline Susann, right
now at the Pittsburgh Public Theater.
Best—selling author of the ultimate
trashy beach read, “Valley of the Dolls,”
Susann was just as famous for her spunk
as she was for her tales of glamorous,

drugged-up, sexed-up starlets.

People have seizedthe novelty of a
writer with personality and are milking
it for all it’s worth. A '
biopic about Susann star-
ring Bette Midler, “Isn’t
She Great,” came out last
year. Some poor sap actually wrote a
sequel to “Valley of the Dolls” (does
anybody remember “Scarlett?”). And
now, at the Public, venerated actors
Marlo Thomas —— yes, she’s “That Girl”

“ — and F. Murray Abraham —-— who won

an Oscar for his performance as Salieri

in “Amadeus” — are having a ball

going retro and talking dirty as Ms.
Susann and her husband Irving
Mansﬁeld. '

Nobody can say a word against

Watch

Thomas and Mansﬁeld in this produc-

tion. They are both at ease moving
about the stage and they have great
chemistry ——-not only with each other,
but the rest of the cast" as well —- includ-
ing the adorable poodle that plays
Jackie’s dog Josephine. —

Joanne Genelle knows how to use

body language and distinctive accents to
give personality to her three different

characters, including Bree, a prosti--

tute/Jacqueline Susann fan.
Armando Rodriguez is
harmless and forgettable as
Jesus, Ms. Susann’s dog-
walker, although the script is partly to
blame for the lack of his character
development. _

Indeed, the script is the only thing
to blame for not elevating this play from
the theater equivalent of paperback
bestseller to a hilarious comedy with
class. Writers" Mark Hampton and
Barbara J. Zitwer, while great at witty
one—liners — “I don’t know any ordi-
nary people,” Jackie declares, “Thank
God” — were lazy when it came to-

making Susann’s character more than a
good-time character. And they deﬁnite-
ly prefer monologue over dialogue —-
the audience is constantly getting talked
at.

J The darker side of the writer’s life
such as her struggles with her autistic
son and cancer is mentioned, but it’s
never really explored — the happy end-
ing with the glittery dress and the danc-
ing shows up before there’s a chance;
the second act remains shockingly
short.

‘ So while the audience gets to laugh
at the dirty jokes and admire Michael
McGarty’s wonderful 1960s style ' set,
which includes a “Star. Trek”-style
chair, ﬂashing colored wall panels and a

. shag rug and takes full advantage of the

Public’s two—tiered stage, we don’t
leave knowing much more than an inter-
view in Cosmopolitan would tell us.

But what’s the point of ‘making a
play based on a person’s¢fabulous per-
sonality if you don’t really consider
what made her fabulous in the first
place?

Digital images beg for
interpretation

Time and Data
Jim Campbell
Through Dec. 22
Wood Street Galleries
(412) 471-6070

ELIZABETH CowAN
The Pitt News

From a battered Webster’s dictio-

nary comes an almost sinister whisper, ‘

filling the quiet gallery. It is Jim
Campbell’s voice accompanied by the
broken sounds of Mozart’s
“Requiem.” The work is titled
“I Have Never Read the
Bible,” a book that is being
read electronically — one let-
ter at a time —— all 3,186,313 of them.

A small picture of Campbell’s father
ﬂashes in and out, beating to the rhythm
of Campbell’s heart. The photograph of

his mother fades more gently, directed ~

by the rhythm of his breath.
Symbolically reminiscent of life sup-
port, a digital memory of Campbell’s

own life force sustains the image of his‘

parents.
Campbell’s exhibit “Time and Data”
is a world of memories — digitally

recorded memories. These memories are
hidden, taking unusual forms; they are

View

transformed into art. Campbell turns to
his Massachusetts Institute of
Technology background to work with
his electronic medium, but the memories
he translates are fundamentally human.
Campbell is both a hardware engi-
neer and artist. This show offers the
opportunity to see Campbell donning his
artist hat in work that fuses these two
roles. Such a combination seems natural
to Campbell, who ﬁnds information pro-
cessing to differ from art only in its goal.
Some of the 24 works on display are
interactive pieces. One-pulls from the
immediate past, projecting a delayed and
broken video image of the room. The
“memory” of people walking past is
captured, realizing Campbell’s goal:
“The idea of your body being under the
control of something else.”
The images are seen
through the ﬁlter of a pock-
et watch, distorting the past
as memories often distort
the truth. _
“Untitled (for Heisenberg)”
involves what Campbell calls “sublimi-
nal interaction.” -In a dark room the
images of two “intimate dancers” are
projected onto a bed of salt (chosen for
its connection with human sweat). When
viewed from a distance, both ﬁgures are
clearly perceived. But as .you step
toward the images, the pixels becomes
so enlarged that the intimate act is no
longer perceived. .
Campbell’s experiments with per-
ception continue on the gallery’s third

ﬂoor. The moving images created by

light emitting diodes force the brain to.

add detail and interpretation; Distortion
is a key component and many of the
LED images are seen through a ﬁlter.

What fascinates Campbell about its.

effect is though “the ﬁlter takes infor1na—

tion away, you‘ see more.”

"Campbell’s artwork takes some-
thing familiar and then “represents it in a
non—literal way.” He turns to ﬁlm in a
number of pieces "and gives them a
unique delivery. Many of his LED
images are based on ﬁlm, though they

are delivered in a way: that demands
more of the audience. '

Campbell’s exhibit also uses popu-
lar ﬁlms “Psycho” and “The Wizard -of
Oz.” He takes these motion pictures and

The door to Dennis Bergevin’s studio
swings almost imperceptibly. Suspended
from the ceiling, not hinged to a frame, the
door is obviously held by only a tenuous
mechanism. Beyond the door, the trap-
pings of a life made in the theater are
exposed: vanity mirrors, wigs, auto-
graphed headshots — including one

drugs.

This is the make-up artist/wigmaker’s
professional life, mocked up for all to see,
one of eight works on display at the
Mattress Factory for “Gestures: An
Exhibition of Small Site Speciﬁc Works,”
which runs through Dec. 8. .

“Gestures” exists as a series of rooms
in a three-story house about a block away
from the Mattress Factory"s main complex.

It seems like just yesterday that music fans
around the globe were clamoring around
Ticketmaster booths and threatening each
other with nuclear weapons to somehow
capture that one last ticket to the greatest
show ever produced by anything in the
universe — including the circus.

But, dry your eyes, hard rock fans.

Converge is promoting their late

new for all you crazy ‘rock fans.

These , patriotic Bostonians take
Hagar’s keen pop sensibility and gracious-
ly intertwine inﬂuences from other nice,
down—home, rock ‘n’ roll bands like the
Bleeding Fetus Organs, Cap’n Gruesome
and the Gore Whores, Dillenger Escape
Plan and Blatant Crap Taste — a band that
Listen.com describes as “everything
you’d expect from a group with such a

With melodious songs like
“Concubine,” Converge mixes home-
cooked guitars —— distorted as hell —— with
just—like—mamma—used-to—make vocals
that scream bloody frigging murder like

Ratt 2

With Relapse

Friday, over 21,8 p.m. 1
M, $15 in advance, $17 at door

  (412) 261-2221 » A

Ratt should lay the smack down on

the English language for spelling “metal” 1

with only one ‘"I‘.” 1

After all, consider the rodent—based
etymology of the band. Formed in the
1970s under the name Mickey Ratt, the
band morphed into their whiskered name-
sake in 1983, at the forefront of the glam
rock revolution. Their ﬁrst album, 1984’s
Out of the Cellar, sold more than 3 mil-

lion copies and the band’s first single,

“Round and Round,” hit No. 12 on the
charts.

Ratt released three more platinum
albums, nine more singles and several
music videos before taking a seven-year
hiatus after the release of their ﬁfth album
Detonator in 1990. They'- released a
comeback album, Collage, in 1997, and

. in 1999, all original members teamed up
' for an ill-fated reunion tour that left them

battling over the ownership of the band’s
infamous, name.

Ratt embarks on their latest tour with
only two original members, Pittsburgher
Bobby Blitzer. on drums, and guitarist

Warren Demartini, who join newcomers 1

Jiz_zy Pearl on vocals, John Corabi on
background ‘vocals and bassist Robby
Crane. Pearl is.a former'L.A. Gun, while
Corabi fronted the short—lived reunion of
Motley Crue sans Vince Neil, and Crane

‘ played with Vince Neil’s band after Neil’s
separation from the Crue. P

But since acid-washed jeans, snap
bracelets and ‘—‘ratted out” hairdos are long
past their heyday, can Ratt still attract a
rabid following or are they at the tail end
of their fame? Fans will decide if this hair
band of the ‘80s can pass itself as hard-

T core metal today.

If you’re ﬁending for the nostalgic
days when mullets ﬂowed proud and

folky fracas  

Michael Fracasso
Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
Rosebud

(412) 261-2221

When, singer-songwriter Michael
Fracasso arrives in town, expect to see
a convergence of hemp—bedecked neo-
hippies and old-school folk rockers‘
alike lining up at the door of the Venue
to celebrate the release of Fracasso’s
new live album, Back to Oklahoma.

Recorded live at ‘Oklahoma City.’ s’

Blue Door along‘ with noted folk gui-
tarist Charlie Sexton, Fracasso’s musi-
cal stylings on Back to Oklahoma can

best be described as a cross between the _

young Bob,Dylan and ‘an acoustic

, Stevie Ray Vaughn, with just a hint of

down-to-earth bluegrass thrownfinto
the mix. Fracasso fits the label of
singer—songwriter perfectly as his pro-

liﬁc and emotional lyrics bend and

twist throughout solid chord progres-
sions, beautifully arpeggiated melodies
and soulful blues licks. i
A few sure-to-be featured tracks
from Fracasso’s new album include
“Nervous Mind” and “Gypsy Moth‘,”

which have a rather Phish-ey, jam-band. ' _

feel to them, as well as “Never

» Enough,” which has the easily_enjoy—

able feel of a good Tom Petty song.
Fracasso then shifts gears on the
emotional title track, where a harmoni-
ca punctuates his bluesy acoustic guitar
to achieve his characteristic dry, travel-
lin’-man country-folk sound. It is in this

track, as well as in the angst-ridden and .

edgy “Elizabeth Lee,” that Fracasso

Areﬂects his blues influences, which
most probably include notables such as .

Muddy Waters and the late -John Lee
Hooker. “Brazos River Blues” stands

alone as the bluesiest song on the V

album. Somewhere, blues legend
Howlin’ Wolf is smiling. ' ‘

Aside from “Big Sister” and “When
I Lived in the Wind,”Fra’casso seems
void of the optimism of his folk-singer
ancestors Harry Chapin or Cat Stevens.

He prefers to take on more of the down . _

and out, “let’s get the hellout of dodge”
sound of Neil Young. ~_
So if you’re a folk fan or a blues

' baby, plan a trip to the Rosebud this
Friday to treat your ears with an intense V

fusion —.of ‘the two styles. Grab a beer or

j a dry gin drink and drown your troubles

in the acoustic ecstasy of Fracasso. 9

It is always important to make a
good first impression.

Brandin Knight and Julius Page
helped the men’s basketball team do
just that Friday by combining to score

32 points, leading the Panthers over

Morgan State, 76-55.

Despite missing three starters
from last year’s team that lost to
Boston College in the Big East cham-
pionship game, Pitt had its way with
the Bears, holding Morgan State to

just 36 percent shooting from the field ‘

and outrebounding the Bears, 42-29.

“Their team executed really well
early in the game,” said Pitt head
coach Ben Howland. “They didn’t
know that we’re supposed to win, and
they showed up ready to play.”

“I think coach Howland can be
pleased with what they did tonight,”
said Bears’ head coach Butch Beard.

Knight, who had eight assists, and
Page, who had a career-high six

» rebounds, , scored 16 points each to
lead Pitt, while J aron. Brown added 14.

points and Mark McCarro1l chipped in

nine. Curtis King led Morgan State

with 13 points and seven rebounds.
“[Julius and I] seem to find each

 

other, especially in transition,” Knight
said. “I kind of always know where
he’s at and he lets me know where,he’s
at.” «
“[We] pick each other up every
game,” Page said. “We tell each other
what we have to do or what we_’re
doing wrong in the game. We know ‘
we’re going to have to carry most of
the load.” _ ,

Pitt played without forward
Donatas Zavackas,_ who was suspend-
ed for the ﬁrst two gamesof the sea-
son because of an NCAA ruling.
Zavackas played 10 games in 1996-97
for Neptunas Klaipeda of Lithuania,
which the NCAA considers a profes-
sional team. _

“I’m not happy that Donatas has to
sit the first two games,” Howland said.
“He’s one of our top players. I was
glad we were able to get a win without
him. In some way it helps because it
gives Mark [McCarroll] and Chevy
[Troutman] more of an opportunity.”

The Panthers got off to a slow start
offensively but kept the Bears in
check, trailing by just three, points at
the 12 minute, 47 second mark of the
first half.

When Dallas Williams walked into the press conference
following Saturday night’s women’s basketball’ game, team-
mate_Mandy Wittemnyer ran over to give her a huge hug.

Williams had a breakout game, scoring a career-high 21
points, but that was where the celebration ended. Her efforts
were overshadowed by Pitt’s 77-72 season-operiing loss to
William and Mary at Fitzgerald Field House. »

“It doesn’t mean anything if we don’t get a win,” said
Williams of her accomplishment. , ' ‘

The Panthers led by as many as eight during the ﬁrst half
but relaxed enough to let the Tribe tie the game at 37 enter-
ing halftime. Pitt then struggled to open the second half, not
scoring until the. 15 minute, 12 second mark when Laine

_ Selwyn sunk a shot from the free throw line.

William and Mary took its largest lead of the game, 13
points, with less than eight minutes remaining. But the
Panthers began to chip away, and a three-pointer by Brooke
Stewart made the score 72-70 in favor of the Tribe with 58
seconds to play. '

Pitt couldn’t get any closer despite aggressive play and

a high level of intensity, and the team suffered its ﬁrst loss of
the season. I ' ' O - i
“I know we were prepared -and I’m really disappointed
about ﬂie loss, but we still have a lot of growing to do,” head
coach Traci Waites said. “We can’t wait for the last three
minutes to try to win games.” ‘
Williams’ 21 points led all Panther scorers and obliterat-
ed her previous career high of 13 points in a game against
Duquesne on Jan, 1, 2000. She averaged just 2.6‘ points per

game last season after missing the first half of the year recov-

ering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

“It was nice because they were guarding me heavily and
it left [Williams] open,” Wittenrnyer said “She took advan-
tage of a great opportunity and I’m so proud of her.” '

Selwyn ﬁnished second with 15 points and added six

assists while VV1tIenmyer contributed a double-double with .

12 points -and 13 rebounds. She was not in her customary
spot in the starting lineup because she has not been practic-
ing because of problems with her ankle, which she has had

Music blared over the Fitzgerald Field House
sound system in between races Thursday night.
Head track coach Steve Lewis acted as master of
ceremonies, welcoming back old friends who sat in
the stands and warning that records could fall in the
next race on the track. , .

This was the track tearn’s 16th annual Blue-
Gold Meet, and although the atmosphere was fes-
tive, there was still some serious track and ﬁeld
going on.

There were four records broken as well as
some close calls, and Blue got the betterof Gold
this year, winning 145-122.

“It’s just a lot of fun and it’s our first chance to
take a peek at the team,” Lewis said.

Things got started well. before freshmen
Courage Otaigbe and Amanda Walker sang the
national anthem, as the ﬁeld events were held a few
hours earlier. Senior Patrick Harding of the Blue
team, who made his first impact for Pitt at the
Blue-Gold Meet last year after transferring from
Stony Brook, N.Y., broke his own meet shot put
record with a toss of 15 feet, 9 inches.

“I’m in better shape than I was in last year,”
said, Harding, who was the Big East indoor cham-
pion in the event last year. “I’m stronger and my
technique’s looking good.” A

Blue senior Nicole Kelly tied the meet record

Panthers beat Northern Arizona for second win

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The men’s basketball team deﬁned the
meaning of “crashing the boards” last night
as they defeated Northern Arizona 58-47.

The Panthers swarmed all around the
basket, making it difﬁcult for the
Lumberjacks to get any opportunity for a
second shot. Pitt dominated the rebounding
category thanks in part to the play of
Ontario Lett, Jaron Brown, Toree Morris
and Mark McCarroll.

Collectively, the four Panthers used‘
their size to their advantage. Brown and
Morris led the Panthers with eight

Waites has a rule that if a’ player does

« said. “IfI could have played her 20 minutes,

I would have, but we were trying to win the

' One factor was in the ‘ineffectiveness of
junior guard Stewart, who was just one of

point attempt late in the game. .
William and Mary was led by Quintina
Walker, who put in a garne-high 25 points

Move the brawl backa week

Column, page 17

It’s been easy to put West Virginia on the
back burner in past years because we had Penn
State to hate. We can still hate Penn State,Cbut
there is nothing we can do about it, since a cer-
tain decrepit old coach holds a grudge against
Pitt because Pitt got into the Big East confer-
ence. Penn State didn’t.

So Penn State, led by a stubborn corpse of
a JoePa, is off getting its ass kicked by some-
one other than Pitt for at leastthe next eight
years, but West Virginia is not going anywhere. .
It’s just too bad it doesn’t look like the date of
the brawl is going to be moving’ anytime soon,
either.

I actually stayed out here for the Backyard
Brawl last year. It was a good game, too.
Kevan Barlow had a career day.

And at least for that single day, I did hate
West Virginia, not because it’s Pitt’s archrival,
but because my Thanksgiving dinner ended up
consisting of some subpar Chinese food.

I’m not making that mistake again. I’m get-
ting my turkey this year, even though it means
going home to the cat I’m violently allergic to

(damn you, Sneakers !).

But I’d still rather have red eyes, itchy skin
and a wheezing cough than to miss out on my
turkey again.

Maybe I’ll snap out of my tryptophan-
induced coma by Saturday in time to watch the -
Backyard ‘Brawl on ESPN.

It’s just a shame that’s the way it has to be.

I have to watch the game on television.

I credit all you locals for going to the game
and all you brave souls who decide to do what
I did last year. I’m also sure that there are plen-
ty of Pitt fans in the same boat as me —-— want-
ing to go to the game, but overpowered by the
need for turkey.

Thanksgiving "rivalries are OK for your
high school. Everybody’s close to home. It’s
not the same in college.'We’re spread out all
over the place. _

Why can’t we move the Backyard Brawl
back a week, closer to finals? I know during
that time I’m usually thinking, “Man, I just got
back from Thanksgiving break, and I don’tfeel
like doing anything. But I’ve got five papers to
write and four exams to study for. God, I hate
school! I just wish...I just wish I had some-
thing to take my frustration out on.”

Why can’t that something be West
Virginia?

_ Now that would be’ a Backyard Brawl ——
stands filled with howling, exam-maddened
Pitt students thirsting for Mountaineer blood.

But that’ll never happen as long as people
like me are at home watching the game on
ESPN.

Whoever is in charge of scheduling games,
please move the brawl‘ back a week. -

. Give Pitt a rivalry.

. Give me another team to hate.

Shaun Griffin is a columnist for the Pin‘ News.
He loves turkey and hates his cat.

Knight, Page combine

to lead Panthers in win

Morgan State, page 16

early minutes of the game on a three by Knight, making the
score 19-17. The Panthers would not give up the lead
again, going on a 15-6 run and taking a 38-25 lead into the
locker room at halftime. _.

Knight carried the team in first half, scoring 13 points
on five-of-eight shooting from the ﬁeld.

“Brandin, early in the game, really settled the team
down with his leadership,” Howland said. “[He] really is
the key to our team and he’s playing like it.” ' '

The Bears came out ﬂying to start the second half,
matching Pitt basket for basket and cutting the lead to 11
with 12:20 to play in the game.

Pitt responded with a three by McCarroll to go up by

14, 54-40.

“When they picked up their intensity [in the second
half], we didn’t match it at first,” Knight said. “[Then]
Mark’.hit the big three and we started to push the lead back
up.”

McCarroll’s basket started a 20-7 run by the Panthers
that putthe game out of reach.

Page, who was playing with an injured right calf mus-
cle, picked up the offense in the second half, scoring 12 of
his 16 points in the final 16 minutes of the game.

“I thought we defended well, especially in the second
half,” Howland said. “I was really pleased with Julius get-
ting a career high in rebounds. We need him to do that
every night.”

“Their bodies were bigger than I anticipated,” Beard
said. “I think [Howland] is pleased with some of, their
effort. They’ll be OK in the Big East.”
