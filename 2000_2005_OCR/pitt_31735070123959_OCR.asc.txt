GSPH dean to step down

raduate School of Public
GHealth (GSPH) Dean

Bernard D. Goldstein is
stepping down as dean effective
Aug. 31,2005.

Goldstein will remain on the
faculty and continue his scholarly
activities as a professor in environ-
mental health and public policy.

During his four—year tenure
as dean, GSPH has risen to third
among the 36 schools of public
health nationwide in funding
from the National Institutes
of Health  behind only
Johns Hopkins and Harvard,
making the school the top state-
related school in competitive NIH
research ﬁmding. In FY03 , GSPH
received $44.9 million in research
funding from NIH, a 50 percent
increase since 2000.

The school also has increased

expanded its facilities to 18 differ-
ent locations throughout Oakland
and nearby areas.

“During his tenure as dean, Dr.
Goldstein has taken the Graduate
School of Public Health to a new
level of excellence in research sup-
port, in community outreach and
service and in the development of

its student enrollment by 25

curricula that meet the needs of the
future public health workforce,”
said Arthur S. Levine, senior vice
chancellor for Health Sciences.
“He has also put the school’s
work on the global public health
map. I’m pleased that Bernie will
remain on the GSPH faculty, so
we’ll continue to beneﬁt from his
expertise in environmental health
and public policy, his vision and
passion for the future of public
health and his wise counsel.”

In announcing his decision
to step down as dean, Goldstein
said: “Working with the faculty,
staff and students of this school
has been the high point of a long
career. I take particular pride in
noting the increased recognition
of the accomplishments of GSPH
by its academic peers and by the
Pittsburgh community.”

As an example, Goldstein

the University Times. Similarly,

credited $76 million in total
research dollars involves faculty
from other Pitt schools. “So,
on balance, we come out very
well,” he said. “Tabulating those
things shows the importance of
our faculty’s research efforts. It
also shows that, more than any
other institution I’ve ever been
associated with, the University
of Pittsburgh engages by far in
the most extensive research col-
laboration.”

Goldstein said his love for
Pittsburgh ﬁgured into his deci-
sion to stay at GSPH. “I love the
town, and one of the factors in my
decision is that my wife convinced
me that I was not taking enough
advantage of the area’s [ameni-
ties],” he said.

As for disappointments as
dean, Goldstein said, “One

out of the way of my faculty and
let them do the important work.
I’ve been saying, ‘I’m going to step
up to the faculty, not step down
as dean,”’ he quipped. “My only
regret is not having come to the
GSPH at a younger age,” said
Goldstein, who is 65.

Will Pitt,
non-proﬁts,
help out city
ﬁnancially?

ittsburgh’s oversight
board is asking tax-
exempt organizations

such as Pitt to help the city crawl
out of ﬁnancial ruin by agreeing
to a new payroll tax or some other
form of contribution.

VV1lliam Lieberman, who is
chairman of the city’s oversight
board and a Pitt trustee, favors the
payroll tax option. Participation
by non-proﬁts would be voluntary
and employers, not employees,
would pay the tax, he said.

The oversight board was
appointed by the state earlier this
year as part of the city’s distressed

status under Act 47 . The oversight
‘lTti*a?d'c?ﬁi“ﬁ1ake‘recommendaﬁons
to the state legislature, which has
the authority to change the tax
structure of the city.

“I’m a trustee and I’m not
interested in adding expense for
Pitt,” Lieberman said. “But we’re
in a difﬁcult time —- every part of
the community has.‘ to feel a little
bit of pain to help the city get out
of its problem.”

To that end, leaders from Pitt,
hospitals, religious organizations
and other tax—exempt groups in
the city met Nov. 17 to discuss
how they could contribute. Pitt
representatives included G.
Reynolds Clark, vice chancellor
for Community and Governmen-
tal Relations, and Paul Supowitz,
associate vice chancellor for
Commonwealth and City/ County
Relations.

“We’re committed to partici-
pating in the process,” Supowitz
said. “We’ve said all along that
it’s important to the University
to have a healthy city and vice
versa.” Supowitz declined to dis-
cuss details on if or how much Pitt
might contribute to the city.

According to Lieberman, the
tax—exempt groups are working
together but have made no deci-
sion on a possible tax rate.

“We’ve asked the non-proﬁts
to come up with a formula to
contribute collectively $6 mil-
lion to the city for unrestricted
use,” he said.

On for-proﬁt businesses, the
oversight board had proposed and
the state legislature passed a 0.5 5
percent payroll tax to be paid by
employers.

The non-proﬁts could pay a
portion of the new 0.55 percent

N ordenberg compensation packa e

ranks 8th among public higher e s

hancellor Mark Norden-
cberg can count himself
among the academic ﬁnan-
cial elite —— he was ranked by The
Chronicle of Higher Education as
the 8th highest paid leader of a
public university nationally.
With a total compensation
package of $553,414 for ﬁscal
year 2003, Nordenberg easily
surpassed the median compen-
sation package of $328,400 for
academic leaders surveyed from
131 public research universi-
ties and public-college systems.
In that same category, Mark A.

Emmert of the University of
Washington, with a compensation
package worth $762,000, topped
the Chronicle’s list for executive
compensation.

The Chronicle deﬁnes execu-
tive compensation as the sum of
salary, beneﬁts, deferred income
and, sometimes, reimbursable
expenses. The newspaper listed
executive compensation in
multiple categories including
public and private institutions
separately.

Generally, compensation
packages are higher for private

institutions than public higher
education systems. According to
the Chronicle, 17 chief executives
earn more than $5 00,000 in public
universities while 42 presidents
from private colleges are above
that same benchmark.

Although Nordenberg ranked
8th in total compensation of an
academic leader at a public insti-
tution, he is by no means in the
ranks of the highest paid execu-
tives in academe. According to the
Chronicle, the top earner across
all categories is Maurice Samuels

New trafﬁc light for Bigelow?

itt has proposed a new
solution to a long-time
pedestrian trouble spot.

Pitt Police ChiefTim Delaney
wants to have an additional traf-
ﬁc light installed in the Bigelow
Boulevard block between Fifth
and Forbes avenues, something he
says will improve both pedestrian
safety and vehicular trafﬁc How.

A Nov. 12 pedestrian trafﬁc
accident (one of two that week
on the Pittsburgh campus) on
Bigelow Boulevard between
the Vi/"illiam Pitt Union and the
Cathedral of Learning once again
has broughtincreased attention to
the crosswalk area there.

Delaney has proposed to city
and Oakland officials install-
ing an additional trafﬁc light at
the crosswalk. He also wants a
“counting signal,” in addition to
a “walk, don’t walk” alert system,
that would count down the sec-
onds prior to the light changing
to alert the pedestrian.

“We have so many students
who in a normal crosswalk
[governed by a trafﬁc light] start
running across even if the light
is changing. I think this system,
along with educating them,
would help if they see: ‘4, 3, 2, 1’
they will wait and not just run 20
yards putting themselves at risk,”
Delaney said.

The proposed traffic light
would be synchronized with the
light at the corner of Bigelow
and Fifth Avenue, he said. VVhen

the light at Fifth for trafﬁc on
Bigelow is green, all pedestrians
at the Bigelow crosswalk would
have a red light. VVhen the light
at Fifth is red, the crosswalk light
also would be red for trafﬁc on
Bigelow approaching the cross-
walk from either Forbes or Fifth
avenues.

Vehicles by law are supposed to
stop for pedestrians, but pedestri-
ans trickle through that crosswalk
and vehicles try to pass through
between them, Delaney pointed
out. “Right now, there’s the uncer-
tainty,” he said. “We always think,
‘Safety ﬁrst.’ But we’re trying to
reach a balance, because vehicular
trafﬁc has to be able to proceed
through the area, too. I think this
would help increase safety as well
as [improve] trafﬁc ﬂow.” 

Officials backing the plari
include City Councilman Bill
Peduto and Maevis Rainey,
executive director of the Oak-
land Transportation and Man-
agement Association (OTMA),
Delaney said.

“We’re working with Maevis
Rainey and [staff from Pitt’s]
Community and Governmental
Relations to get the money for
this,” Delaney said.

Potential funding sources

include Gov. Ed Rendell’s home-

town streets and school safety
program, Delaney said.

Dan Gilman, a spokesperson
in Peduto’s office, said, “The
councilman believes the area can
be both safe and drivable, and he
supports [installing] a trafﬁc light
there, although the project may
include moving the crosswalk
more toward the center of the
block to allow more cars to turn
from Fifth onto Bigelow.”

Gilman added that a left-
turn-only green arrow also could
be added for Fifth Avenue trafﬁc
turning onto Bigelow.

“Right now, we’re working
with OTMA and other Oakland
community groups, like the
Oakland Community Council
and the Oakland Task Force,

astwell. as P,ennDOT. to. reach, a
consensus on this,” Gilman said.

“We’re in the process of schedul-
ing meetings with those groups.
Then the project will be brought
to trafﬁc engineering at the [city]
Department of Engineering and
Construction for approval.”
Delaney also is pushing for
sidewalk cut—outs on the William
Pitt Union side of Bigelow to add
more room for queuing shuttles
that currently inhibit vehicular
trafﬁc ﬂow.

payroll tax on for-proﬁt organiza-
tions. If the non-proﬁts were to
pay 2 0 percent of the new tax, that
would translate approximately
into a 0.1 percent payroll tax,
he said. “We want to implement
this tax uniformly, across the board
—— the same rate for non-proﬁts
whether they have 10 or 10,000
employees.” Lieberman added
that he wanted the non-proﬁts
to commit to a payroll tax rate
byJan. 1.

Payment and disbursement of
the non—proﬁt payroll tax would
most likely go through the Pitts-
burgh Foundation, Lieberman
said, although the details are not
yet worked out.

And if a tax-exempt organiza-
tion opts out of the payroll tax,
there is no hammer to legally
enforce compliance, Lieberman
acknowledged. “Non-profits
have to agree to this, we can’t force
them,” he said. “But non-proﬁts

that decline to participate, in my
view, do so at peril. The legislature
is looking to them to help out and
the legislature will be unhappy if
they don’t help out — there are
potential consequences.”

If Pitt agrees to a new payroll
tax or another form of payment,
it won’t be the ﬁrst time.

Pitt and two University health
center hospitals agreed in 1988 to
give the city $11 million over the
course of a decade to offset the
cost of municipal services.

The University’s last payment
in lieu of taxes to the city was for
$85,000 in 2001, according to
Richard Fees, city treasurer. But
he added that officials from the city
and Pitt discussed the issue and the
city sent a request for payment for
the subsequent years.

Pitt ofﬁcials could not conﬁrm
that information before the Uni-
versity Times went to press.

whose compensation package
topped $35.1 million in FY03.
Samuels is senior vice president
of international fixed-income
investments.

In Pitt’s own backyard,
Duquesne University Chan-
cellor John Murray’s earnings
package totaled $977,827 in
the Chronicle’s category of pri-
vate institution compensation.
Among public universities and
colleges, Penn State’s Graham
Spanier received a compensation
package of $399,489 (in FY99,
the most current information
the Chronicle could secure) and
Carnegie Mellon PresidentJared
Cohon’s compensation package
totaled $480,953.

The Chronicle’s compensa-
tion summary for Nordenberg in
FY03 listed a salary of $390,000,
$144,2 89 in beneﬁts and deferred
compensation, $11,257 in
expenses and $7,868 in tuition
beneﬁts for dependents.

Pitt was one of three insti-
tutions surveyed in the public
university/college category that
did not disclose current com-
pensation ﬁgures, saying it was
a “quasi—public” institution.
Instead, the Chronicle used data
from the University’s federal tax
ﬁlings for FY 2003.

Campus reaction to Norden-
berg’s ranking was positive.

“Chancellor Nordenberg is
worth every penny,” said Senate

Council President Nicholas
Bircher. “He is scrupulously fair
and scrupulously honest — quali-
ties which are not guaranteed at
any price in the corporate world.
As an attorney, if he were the man-
aging partner in a billion-dollar—a—
yearlaw ﬁrm, he would be making
much more, I suspect.”

Bircher said N ordenberg’s
skills as an attorney and a manager,
coupled with his background as a
faculty member, give him “exper—
tise much greater than some of his
corporate counterparts.”

Staff Association Council
President Rich Colwell also
praised Nordenberg’s track
record, but said he would like to
see staff recognized as well for the
University’s successes.

“This year has been touted as
being one of Pitt’s best in a variety
of measures: increased applica-
tions, increased research funding
and NSF rankings, quality of stu-
dents and a rise in endowments,”
Colwell said. “These achieve-
ments could not have taken place
without the hard work of dedicated
staff members,”

Colwell added that faculty sala-
ries have gained ground but “it is
time for staff to be recognized for
their contributions to this effort
and staff salaries ranges to be
increased along with the increases
of faculty and the upper adn1inis—
tration.”

Raising regional faculty salaries

To the University community:

Certainly all faculty at the
University of Pittsburgh’s regional
campuses were gratiﬁed by the
news, as reported in the Uni-
versity Times this past summer
(May 27, 2004) that Pitt’s central
administration had succeeded
in reaching its goal of raising
salaries of Pitt professors on the
Oakland campus to AAU median
levels. This is a ﬁne achievement
by the central administration and
the obvious result of careful plan-
ning and speciﬁc redistribution of
resources.

At the same time, regional
campus faculty were appalled to
learn, in the same Times article,
that regional campus salaries
languish at the very bottom of
those same AAU rankings. We
hope that the central administra-
tion has already developed a plan
similar to one used in Oakland,
to raise regional salaries to AAU
median levels as well.

Respectfully, we, as regional

Internal investigation counters
CI‘1t1C1Sm of communication dept.

n internal investigation
debunked allegations
that faculty in Pitt’s com-

munication department routinely
engage in consensual sexual rela-
tionships with graduate students,
according to the University.

A routine external review
panel concluded last spring that
the Department of Commu-
nication fostered a “culture in
which senior faculty routinely
and repeatedly have engaged in
consensual sexual relationships
with graduate students.”

According to sources familiar
with the report’s conﬁdential con-
tents, the resulting climate created
an unsafe environment for female
students, the reviewers contended.
Their report further criticized the
faculty as generally resistant to
diversity efforts.

The University’s policy on fac-
ulty-student relationships (Policy
02-04-03) prohibits a faculty
member from having intimate
relations with a student whose aca-
demic work, teaching or research
is being supervised or evaluated by
the faculty member.

_ Upon receipt of the exter-
nal reviewers’ report in .March,
Arts and Sciences Dean N. John
Cooper requested that Pitt’s Ofﬁce
of General Counsel conduct an
investigation into the allegations.
Cooper said the investigation
included interviewing all current
and a number of former com-
munication graduate students,
all tenure-stream faculty and

  r 

and the three external reviewers,
among others.

In a statement released Nov.
8, Cooper acknowledged that
Pitt investigators had uncovered
evidence of past faculty—student
sexual liaisons and had discovered

“The broad
generalizations by the
external review
committee regarding
the atmosphere within

the department were
not supported by the
ﬁndings of the
investigators.”

—-Dean N. j’o/an Cooper

“allegations of harassment from
several years ago” that had been
investigated and addressed, but
that had nonetheless left “residual
effects” on the department.

(For ﬁtll text of Dean Cooper’s
statement, see box on this page.)

But Cooper’s statement
disputed the generalizations
regarding the current depart-
ment atmosphere as depicted in
the reviewers’ report. “The inves-
tigators uncovered no evidence of
any current faculty/ student sexual
relationships,” Cooper stated.
“And the investigation deter-
mined that the pastsexual relations
between faculty and graduate stu-
dents within the department that

critically, the overwhelming bulk
of male and female graduate stu-
dents within the department do
not agree with the characterization
of the current climate provided by
the external reviewers,” Cooper
stated. He added that allegations
about resistance to diversity also
were not supported by the inves-
tigators’ ﬁndings.

The Pitt investigators rec-
ommended actions to avoid
future mischaracterizations of
the department, which are being
implemented over time, Cooper
stated. He declined to specify the
recommendations.

In response to a question about
why his public statement was not
released when he received the
General Counsel report in late
spring, Cooper told the Univer-
sity Times, “Nobody asked for a
statement. And I wanted time to
digest the ﬁndings of the [inves-
tigators’] report, and to work
with the department in sharing
these ﬁndings before I released
a statement.”

CI

The external reviewers’ conﬁ-
dential report followed a routine
audit that included a two-day site
visit in February. Such external
reviews typically are done every
1 0 years by communication faculty
from three other universities.

The reviewers’ report, which
was distributed to the departments

leaked to some media, including
The Pitt News, which broke the

report’s allegations that the

buildings

Pitt has received a $150,000 grant from the Getty Foundation
to support a comprehensive inventory of historic buildings on the
Pittsburgh campus. Grant ftmds will be used to assess exterior and
interior conditions of the structures, develop a comprehensive preser-
vation manual for Pitt’s Facilities Management division and produce
cost estimates for recommended conservation work.

Ron Leibow, senior project manager in Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Facilities
Management, is working with the architectural ﬁrm of Pfaffmarm
and Associates to conduct an extensive exterior and interior review
of the Cathedral of Learning; extensive exterior and cursory interior
reviews of the Stephen Foster Memorial, Heinz Chapel, Clapp Hall
and the Music Building, and cursory exterior reviews of Belleﬁeld
Hall, the Vi/illiam Pitt Union, Schenley Apartments, Alumni Hall

and the log cabin.

“The greater endgame is that some sort of best practices are
written down for when the University undertakes signiﬁcant capital
projects on these historic buildings,” said Leibow.

Currently, Leibow’s group is conducting historical research to
understand how the buildings were designed and the importance of

certain design features.

I’ll just say that the department I
read about in the newspapers is
not one that I recognize. There
was just this amazing spiral of
misunderstandings feeding on
each other.”

For instance, Lyne said, Dean
Cooper’s statement pointed out
that the reference to an “unsafe
climate” was based on a hypotheti-
cal concern posed to one external
reviewer. “You have to wonder
how we got from there to the sto-
ries we saw [in the newspapers],”
Lyne said. “I was pleased to see that
none of the graduate students who
were contacted by the newspapers
indicated that they were unhappy
with the department.”

Lyne added thatThe Chronicle
of Higher Education story, quot-
ing directly from the reviewers’
report, said that “by virtually any
relevant criterion, the department
today is healthy and signiﬁcantly
improved since its last review.”

Lyne further expressed relief
that allegations in the reviewers’
report proved unfounded. “It was

University, butI think the dean got
the answers to the questions that
had been raised. I am, of course,
relieved to see the dean’s public
statement about his findings, and I
don’t thinkit would be appropriate
for me to comment further on that.
Our concern now is to be proactive
in trying to avoid further conﬂicts
or misunderstandings.”

Regarding resistance to
diversity, Lyne said that two of
the 14 full-time communication
department faculty are African
American. “And we have faculty
with joint appointments with a
number of diverse areas, such as
cultural studies, women’s studies,
bioethics, Africana studies and his-
tory and philosophy of science.
Our 30 graduate students also
are a diverse group, representing
a number of countries.”

Lyne added that the Depart-
ment of Communication houses
one of the top doctoral programs
of its kind nationally and that
with 650 undergraduate majors,
the program is among the most
popular at Pitt. “I’ve very proud of
this department’s achievements,”
he said. “We have internationally
recognized faculty, who present all
over the world, who are authors
and who are editors of leading
journals.”

Dean Cooper’s Nov. 8 statement
regarding communication dept.

The Department of Communication in the School of Arts
and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh plays an important
role in both our undergraduate and graduate programs, offering
one of our most popular undergraduate majors and a doctoral
program that has an outstanding record of placing its graduates
in faculty positions in major universities and colleges throughout
the country.

'  i i The school routinely reviews each of its departments to ensure

that our goals for the educational, research and scholarly programs
of that department are met. Reviews blend internal and external
review processes, and the external component of a review of our
Department of Communication last spring generated a report
that contained allegations of a culture of routine and repeated
sexual relations between faculty and graduate students that gave
rise to an unsafe environment for female graduate students. The
seriousness of these allegations, and their incompatibility with
our commitment to the maintenance of an appropriate academic
environment that functions in a manner consistent with the poli-
cies and procedures of the University, led me to request that the
Ofﬁce of General Counsel investigate the allegations. I received
that report in early summer.

The investigation by University Counsel was both extensive
and thorough, and involved interviews with, or communication
with, virtually all of the current graduate students, a number of
former graduate students, all of the Department’s tenure stream
faculty, some non-tenure stream faculty, the external reviewers
and others.

The broad generalizations by the external review committee
regarding the atmosphere within the department were not sup-
ported by the ﬁndings of the investigators. Most critically, the
overwhelming bulk of male and female graduate students within
the department do not agree with the characterization of the
current climate provided by the external reviewers. The investiga-
tors uncovered no evidence of any current faculty/student sexual
relationships, and the investigation determined that the past sexual
relations between faculty and graduate students within the depart-
ment that allegedly determined the climate of the department could
not be characterized as either routine or repeated. No current
student has indicated that any faculty member has approached the
student in a manner that was inappropriate or made him or her
feel uncomfortable, and the language in the report implying that
female graduate students feel unsafe was based on a hypothetical
concern posed to one external reviewer. The reviewers’ statement
that there was a “resistance to diversity generally” also was not
supported by the ﬁndings of the investigation.

The investigation did uncover evidence of past faculty/ student
relationships and determined that there were residual effects from
these relationships and from allegations of harassment from several
years ago (allegations that investigators concluded had been appro-
priately investigated and addressed). Investigators recommended
a number of actions to help the department move on from its past
and avoid future conflict, and these conﬁdential recommenda-
tions have been accepted by me and are being implemented on
an appropriate time scale. I

 

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Senate committee declines to ask

provost for student survey info

he University Senate’s

educational policies

committee (SEPC)
backed away from requesting
undergraduate student satisfac-
tion survey results, following a
discussion with a senior official
from the Provost’s ofﬁce.

SEPC had been urged by
Faculty Assembly to request
from Provostjames V. Maher the
survey results to aid in evaluating
two separate documents that offer
recommendations on improving
the campus climate for students.

(See Nov. 11 University
Times.)

Pitt surveyed freshmen,
sophomores and juniors from
1997 to 2001, and then again
this past spring, according to
Jack L. Daniel, vice provost for
Undergraduate Studies, dean of
students and chancellor’s liaison
to SEPC.

Daniel said the survey had
some 5 0 questions covering eight
domains of student satisfaction.
“The problem with sharing the
results is that this was done strictly
for formative purposes and its con-
ﬁdential information was meant
for the eyes of the provost and his
senior staff,” he said. “That was
the purpose of the survey. We’re
not trying to be secretive. We’ve
used it to guide our interventions
as necessary.”

In addition, students who con-
sented to be surveyed were assured
that the results of the survey would
not be made public, Daniel told
the educational policies comrnit—
tee Nov. 16.

SEPCmemberspressedDaniel

about providing an overview or

summary of the survey, but Daniel
countered that a summary would
only force further discussion.

For example, Daniel said,
what would happen if he told
SEPC that the survey showed a
particular school to be a much
worse environment for students
than other Pitt schools?

“People would demand
answers: VVhy is this so? VVhat
are your data? What’s being done
about it? Who’s responsible? That
was not the purpose of this forma-
tive survey, and I think the request
(to the provost) is inappropriate,”
Daniel said.

SEPC members then voted
to report the gist of their dis-
cussion to Faculty Assembly for
further instructions, which could
include requesting resources from
the Provost’s ofﬁce to perform a

separate student survey.

The committee will continue
to evaluate the recommenda-
tions of the two campus climate
documents under its review, SEPC
chair Thomas Metzger said.

The documents are the 2001
“Campus Climate Survey,” which
was published by Pitt’s women’s
studies program, and “Campus
Climate” by Susan Rankin, which
is a report of the Policy Institute
of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force issued in 2003.

“We still will work with the
anti—discriminatory polices com-
mittee to look at these documents”
as they apply to current student
satisfaction on the Pittsburgh
campus, Metzger said.

° The committee discussed
Pitt’s academic integrity stan-
dards, particularly whether poli-
cies applying to student cheating
are uniform.

Daniel pointed out that
the Provost’s office web site
(wvvw.pitt.edu/ ~provost/ ail .htm1)
posts guidelines on student cheat-
ing and other academic integrity
issues, including the grievance
process and sanctions.

Those guidelines, which were
approved by Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Gen-
eral Counsel, were distributed to
all deans, who were charged with
preparing school-speciﬁc policies
based on that model, Daniel said.
“There may be some differences
regarding the curriculum or what
r11les govern a practicum or a lab
depending on the school,” Daniel
cited as an example.

“All schools have prepared
a policy and those have been
approved by General Counsel,”
he noted. The information is
well disseminated, Daniel said,
including at faculty orientation,

in faculty and student handbooks

and on academic unit web sites.

' The committee accepted the
conclusions of the Nov. 8 report
issued by Arts and Sciences Dean
N. John Cooper on the Depart-
ment of Communication. That
report countered allegations in a
conﬁdential — but leaked to some
media — report by outside review-
ers that the department had a cul-
ture of intimate relations between
faculty and students. Pitt’s Policy
02-04-03 forbids relationships
between a faculty member and
a student whose academic work
is being evaluated by the faculty
member. (See related story on page
3.)

In April the SEPC took a
wait-and-see stance pending the
report from Cooper. (See April 29
University Times.)

“His report said this did
happen in the past, it’s not hap-
pening in the present, and so we
have nothing more to do with that
as a committee,” Metzger said. “If
those problems had continued, we
might have pursued something.”

the most popular foods on the
Thanksgiving table and weighs
in at 200 calories per 1/2 cup.
Although very fattening, stufﬁng
remains a holiday rite that few
pass up.

So what can be done to atone
for the Thanksgiving feast?

Parker’s advice: Eat only three
big meals (Thanksgiving, Christ-
mas and NewYear’s Day); exercise
more or just move around for at
least 3 0 minutes after eating to aid
digestion; cut back food intake on
non-holidays and realize that “it’s
just a meal,” she said.

Other strategies: Even though
a vegetable may be sprinkled with
a fattening sauce or cheese, a larger
portion might prevent you from
eating something more fattening.

 

 

Skip the cranberry sauce and eat
fruit. Take a smaller piece of
pumpkin pie. A second helping
of white meat with a little gravy
packs less of a caloric punch than
a similar serving of stufﬁng and
mashed potatoes with gravy.

And what does one eat for
Thanksgiving after spending 30
years as a nutritionist?

“I cook the way most people
cook, I don’t really modify much.
But I try to modify portions,”
Parker said.

“Dressing is my favorite food,”
she admits. And Parker said she
still uses meat in her stufﬁng, but
moistens it with broth instead of
butter — hence, choosing her
fats wisely.

RESEARCH NOTES

Patients who
get breathing
tube prior to
hospital arrival
fare worse

Emergencymedicineresearch—
ers at the University have found
that patients with similar trau-
matic brain injuries who receive
an emergency breathing tube at
the scene of an accident fare worse
than those intubated after arriving
at the hospital.

The researchers also found
that these patients’ neurologic
and functional outcome was nearly
twice as bad. These ﬁndings are
reported in the November issue of
Annals of Emergency Medicine.

Endotracheal intubation is an
emergency medical procedure
whereby trained medical person-
nel place a ﬂexible, clear, plastic
breathing tube down into the
trachea to help air pass freely to
and from the lungs. Often patients
with traumatic brain injury need
help to breathe to prevent further

While out—of—hospital intuba-
tion is a valuable interventional
tool in helping to save patients’
lives, earlier studies had suggested
that this rapid intervention might
be more harmful than helpful.

The Pitt researchers con-
ducted a retrospective analysis
using data obtained from the
Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome
Study between 2000 and 2002
and studied adult patients with
severe head injuries.

The primary outcome for
most of these patients was death,
with secondary outcomes being
various types of neurologic and

4,098 patients who were
intubated, odds of death were
about four times greater if they
were intubated out of the hospital.
Neurologic and overall functional
impairment also was greater.
“These findings present
important challenges to the
emergency medicine profession
and EMS communities,” stated
Donald M. Yealy, professor and
vice chairman of the Department
of Emergency Medicine at the
School of Medicine and one of
the study authors. “Paramedics,

program has announced that Pitt
researchers will receive more than
$1 million in grants for breast
cancer research.

The awards, given to only 14
percent of grant applicants, will
allow Pitt researchers to initiate
six original projects on breast
cancer prevention, detection and
treatment.

Pitt projects funded by the
DOD grants include:

Laparoscopic
gastric bypass
effective for
recurrent GERD

Laparoscopic gastric bypass
surgery can effectively control
gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
(GERD) symptoms in morbidly
obese patients who had previous
antireﬂux surgery, with the addi-
tional beneﬁt of weight loss and
improvement of co-morbidities,
according to a study published in
the November issue of the journal
Obesity Surgery.

The School of Medicine study
found that gastric bypass is feasible
and effective in controlling GERD
in patients who had previous anti-
reﬂux surgery and who have subse-
quently gained signiﬁcant weight,
and in obese patients who have
had previous antireﬂux procedures
and continued to have problems
with GERD.

“Despite a morbidity rate of
42.8 percent, this study showed
that all patients did well with
zero mortality and were satis-
ﬁed with their condition during
the follow—up period, suggesting
that the long—term outcome of
laparoscopic gastric bypass in

 hast. eteviees

~   ajnrrf“   "   "      em of’B‘i'ostat1's’-"-

antireﬂux surgery is promis-
ing,” said Ioannis Raftopoulos,
assistant professor of surgery in
the Division of Thoracic and

Foregut Surgery at the School of
Medicine, and principal author of
the study. “There also was a sig-
niﬁcant improvement of GERD
symptoms following the laparo-
scopic gastric bypass, which was
maintained during follow—up.”
In addition, 70 percent of
associated co-morbid medical
conditions were either resolved
or improved signiﬁcantly.
“Although a direct cause-effect
relationship between obesity and
GERD has not been clearly estab-
lished, obesity is often associated
with GERD. Up to 5 5 percent of
morbidly obese patients present-
ing for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass have symptoms of

' chronic GERD,” said James D.

Luketich, professor of surgery,
chief of the Division of Thoracic
and F oregut Surgery, co-direc-
tor of the Mark Ravitch/Leon
C. Hirsch Center for Minimally
Invasive Surgery and senior author
of the study.

GERD is a signiﬁcant public
health problem affecting up to
40 percent of the American adult
population.

Laparoscopic gastric bypass
after antireﬂux surgery is a tech-
nically more difﬁcult procedure,
which is reﬂected in the prolonged
operative time (mean 372 min.)
and length of hospital stay (mean
4.8 days).

“It is important to emphasize
that success rates for first time redo
antireﬂux surgery, which would
be the alternative to laparoscopic
gastric bypass, range between 60
percent and 80 percent and fall to
50 percent for second time redo
antireﬂux surgery,” Raftopoulos
said.

“This degree of weight loss
ishegpalj _ to _ that experienced

y patients who undergo gas-
tric bypass surgery primarily
for obesity, and is enough to
impact dramatic improvements

in obesity-related co-morbid
medical conditions. ” said Anita P.
Courcoulas, assistant professor of
surgery, and director of bariatric
surgery at UPMC Shadyside and
a co—author of the study.

Omega—3 fatty acids for neck

according to a study presented
at a recent annual meeting of
the American College of Nutri-

Clinical Nutrition.

Joseph C. Maroon, professor
and vice chairman of the Depart-
ment of Neurological Surgery in

Who loses when U.S. cles its doors
to international students & workers?

urrent U.S. immigration
cpolicies threaten Ameri-

ca’s standing in the world
by stiﬂing the needed infusion of
international talent in academia,
research and commerce, two local
educational leaders warned.

Alan Lesgold, dean of Pitt’s
School of Education, and Stewart
Sutin, presidentof the Community
College of Allegheny County and
former senior vice president and
international department head for
Mellon Financial Corp., addressed
“America’s Reverse Brain Drain,”
offering gloomy prognostications
for the American economy, labor
force and higher education sys-
tems.

“Unfortunately, the prevailing
public view today is that we need
to lock our doors,” said Lesgold
at the Nov. 17 brain drain forum.
“The level of misinformation and
distrust is so great that altruistic
arguments won’t work [to coun-
termand thatview]. N 0 one seems
to care that it is simply the right
thing to make it easy for students
to study here and for intellectual
leaders to work here.”

A 2.4 percent decline in 2003-
2004 in the number of interna-
tional students enrolled in U.S.

institutions of higher education
—the first signiﬁcant decline since
1972 — is one tell-tale sign of a
weakening United States. Other
signs include expanded research
and commerce opportunities in
a growing number of countries

worldwide, extensions of global
connectedness that  policies
are thwarting, and p rceptions
abroad that the United States is
inhospitable to internationals,
including the brightest students,
leading scholars and technology
experts.

(See sidebar story on Pitt’s recent
international student enrollment
statistics.)

“In the academic world, the
situation is urgent,” Lesgold
maintained. “Once the U.S. was
the sole source of advanced study
and knowledge. If you wanted a
great education in technical areas
you had to come here. Today, in the
information age, this is changing
very quickly.”

Now, competition from a
growing number of first-rate
institutions globally is increas-
ing options. Moreover, increased
knowledge-sharing across tradi-
tional borders also diminishes
the U.S. role as the only game
around.

“A cognitive science doctoral
student today can study anywhere
in Germany with an Internet
connection to any adviser at any
other university in the country,
and this will soon expand to the
entire European community, I’m
sure, and then to the rest of the
world,” Lesgold said.

But while the rest of scholarly
world is becoming ever more
interconnected, “We’ve slammed
the doors on students who want to

come here, and we’re not making it
to easier for students to learn from
us over the Internet either because
of restrictions on software that the
federal government enforces,” he
said.

U.S. policies also inhibit
scientiﬁc presenters from shar-
ing knowledge within the U.S.
borders, he pointed out.

After 9/1 1, the U.S. Depart-
ment of State sent a cable alerting
American consular officers around
the globe that any ofﬁcial granting
a visa to a proven terrorist would
be prosecuted for negligence,
Lesgold said.

“Look at the fundamental
mindset we’ve created: Ifyou have
the slightest doubt about anybody,
use any excuse possible to prevent
an international from obtaining a
visa. The result [of that mindset]
in fact is that people will choose,
are choosing, other countries. The
economy of Asia is booming and

“We are shooting
ourselves in the
foot by pretend-
ing that stopping
technical scholars
will prevent
terrorist attacks.”
—Dean Alan Lesgold

we are starting to see an intel-
lectual gold rush to that region,”
he said.

“A number of high-tech com-
panies are starting to complain to
the government that they can’t get
enough skilled workers now that
our doors are blocked,” Lesgold
said. VVhile well-connected com-
panies may have restrictions loos-
ened, he said, “a true free market
economy requires that economic
forces, not government and lob-
bying, determine who comes here
to Work. That is not the case at
present.” '

Nor is America’s brain drain
a short-term problem, pending
victory in the war on terrorism,
Lesgold said. “Perhaps it is worth
temporarily falling a bit behind
to be absolutely sure we don’t let
in any bad guys,” Lesgold said.
“That’s a very weak argument.
We still have a porous border.
People can get in, and surely those
willing to die for their beliefs are
also willing to risk going to jail if
caught. Hassling the best students
around the world, those who are
working on their studies rather
than being destructive, will not
reduce the dangers we face. We
are shooting ourselves in the
foot by pretending that stopping
technical scholars [from entering
U.S. borders] will prevent terror-
ist attacks.”

U.S. restrictions are sure to
come back to haunt Americans,
Lesgold said. “Why should anyone

. .. .._.. ...; .J-~a\. ~/44.: Ax:

believe that we in the U.S. will
continue to enjoy free entry with
minimal hassle everywhere while
we dump on those countries’
citizens who want to come here?
Reciprocity is on the ways, folks,
and we’re teaching a kind of inver-
sion of the Golden Rule, teaching
lessons to our neighbors today on
how we should be treated tomor-
row. We have locked the door and
it locks us in at least as well as it
locks others out.”
Ci

CCAC President Sutin said
that the lack of trust in immi-
grants is embedded deeply in
the history in the United States,
often with serious negative rami-
ﬁcations such as the internment
of ]apanese—American citizens
and the treatment of German-
Americans in the 1940s, and the
“Red scare” of the McCarthy era
in the 195 Os.

“After 9/11, it was a miracle
that the reaction wasn’t worse
toward the domestic Islamic
population,” he said.

“However, we’ve developed a
bureaucratic thinking - mindless
stuff under the rubric of national
security. Instead of offering visas
for those who deserve them, we’re
saying: ‘We don’t know who the
enemy is, so we’re keeping every-
body out.”’

This head-in-the-sand stance
has serious consequences for the
U.S. economy both home and
abroad, Sutin said.

NOVEMBER 24, 2004

Immigrants traditionally have
supplemented the American—bom
labor force throughout U.S.
history, Sutin noted. Western
Pennsylvania is a classic case of
employing waves of immigrant
laborers who became the human
backbone of the local and regional
economy, he said.

But with the baby boomer
generation facing retirement age,
immigration restrictions will kill
the ﬂow of replacement laborers.
“We’re sitting on a demographic
time-bomb,” Sutin said.

Moreover, he said, the Ameri-
can attitude of “going it alone” is
doomed to failure in the global
economy. “We’re beating our
chest and saying we don’t need
foreign partners, but 40 percent
of our economy already is tied up
in international markets,” Sutin
said. VVhile the global economy
is expanding and strengthening,
the United States is hindering its
role with isolationistimmigration
policies, he said.

How is the world intercon-
nected? “We are girded to the
international economy. There
are global environmental issues.
There are global health issues:
AIDS, TB, and inﬂuenza do
not honor borders,” Sutin said.
“Yet in education we have this
schizophrenic behavior: Foreign
language instruction here is weak,
so is instruction for social studies,
history, geography. We’re becom-
ing mono—cultured.

“VVhere do we go from here?
The Current polices are harmful,
but if we sit back and wait for
change, we become part of the
problem,” Sutin continued. “If
we have to wait for,policy—makers,
either in the federal government
or the state level, it won’t work.
The educational community has
to take the lead.”

The biggest obstacle for the
education system is mono-cultural
thinking, he said. “In education
we need to prepare ourselves, not
passively, but to embrace a multi-
cultural environment where race,
ethnicity and other outward char-
acteristics are not determinant,
but where the value of one’s soul
is. We can use this discussion as
a springboard for serious intro-
spection: of our underlyingvalues,
our lack of trust and conﬁdence
in people.”

VVhen he was an adjunct
instructor at Pitt’s Katz Gradu-
ate School of Business, Sutin said,
his goal was to provide ideas that
shook students out of their Ameri-
can-centric viewpoints.

“I told my students to read
about events somewhere in the
world and think about rimning a
company in that country —— put
yourself in their shoes. How do
these events affect your com-
pany?” he said.

American educators also need
to push international experiences,
such as study—abroad programs in
non-English-speaking countries,
where students have to learn the
local conversational languages and
customs.

At CCAC, Sutin established a
diversity council “to create a sensi-
tive, inclusive environment driven
by the value of the soul and not
the letter of the law.”

The Nov. 17 forum, held in
recognition of International Edu-
cation Week 2 004, was sponsored
by Pitt’s Office of International
Services and the University Center

Pitt’s international enrollment falls by 4%

nternational student enroll-

ment at Pitt has dropped by

almost 4 percent in the last
year — the largest percentage
decline in 20 years, according to
the University’s Office of Interna-
tional Services (OIS) and Office of
Institutional Research (OIR).

This year’s fall (ﬁscal year 2 005)
enrollment of international stu-
dents saw drops in both graduate
and undergraduate admissions:
Pitt enrolled a total of 1,667
international students at its Pitts-
burgh campus, down from 1,734
last year. Graduate enrollment of
international students slipped by
3.2 percent (from 1,590 students
in FY04 to 1,540 in FY05) and
undergraduate enrollments fell by
almost 12 percent (from 144 stu-
dents in FY04 to 127 in FY05).

Although undergraduate
enrollment of international stu-
dents accounts for only about 8
percent of the current interna-
tional student population, the
downward trend in admissions is
alarming, particularly over the last
fewyears, according to OIS direc-
tor David Clubb. Undergraduate
enrollment of international stu-
dents at Pitt has plummeted 32.4
percent over the last two years
from 188 to 127 students.

But Pitt has not been as hard hit
by declining international student
enrollment as most major univer-
sities, according to Pitt Provost

James Maher. -

“We at Pitt have such long
standing relations with interna-
tional universities ’th'at"we have
not experienced as severe an effect

of these problems as most major
universities, but we are concerned
about the trend,” he said.
According to Maher, the
national decline in international
student enrollment appears to
be driven by the combination of
post 9-11 difficulty in securing
visas and the ﬁnancial hardship
of the new $50 federal fee for a

visa application.

“The University is working”

actively with the Association of
American Universities to discuss
with federal government ways to
expedite the visa process for legiti-
mate international students,” he
added.

Last year, Pit’s total interna-
tional enrollment actually rose
by 0.2 percent while nationally,
international student enrollment
slipped 2.4 percent. This was
the ﬁrst nationwide decline in
32 years, according to the Open
Doors report from the Institute of
International Education.

The Open Doors report, which
gauges international student pres-
ence in the United States, found
that international undergraduate
enrollments decreased nationwide
by almost 5 percent while graduate
admissions rose by 2.5 percent.

According to the study, the
decline in international students
enrolled in U.S. colleges and
universities has been attributed
to a variety of reasons, including

real and perceived difﬁculties in
obtaining students visas, rising
U.S. tuition costs, vigorous
recruitment by other English-
speaking nations and perceptions
that international students are no
longer be welcome in the United
States.

also found that most patients had
no side effects and that 86 per-
cent planned to continue the use

Discogenic disease is one of
the greatest causes of pain and
disability in the United States,
affecting approximately 1 out
of 4 people at some time in their
lives. Many studies have shown a
marked inﬂammatory reaction at
the site of the herniated lumbar
discs, according to Maroon.

“It is important for patients
to understand that less toxic alter-
natives to anti—inflammatories are
available,” he said.

“Previous studies have shown
that omega-3 EFAs prevent blood
clots, reduce pain, enhance the
immune system and cause dila-
tion of the blood vessels. In fact,
as of September of this year, the
FDA now recognizes that omega-
3 EFAS can prevent coronary
artery disease. Two clinical trials
also have shown that arthritis
patients who take ﬁsh oils could
eliminate or sharply reduce their

use of N SAIDS.”

Tiny exosomes
ma be ‘magic
hul et' for
drug-free organ
transplants
Bubble-like nanoscale par-
ticles that are shed by dendritic
cells may hold the key to achiev-
ing transplant tolerance — the
long-term acceptance of trans-

of the first information aboutwhat
these structures called exosomes
actually do.

Exosomes are no larger than
65-100 nanometers — 1,000 times
smaller than the diameter of a
human hair — yet each contains a
potent reserve of major histocom—
patibility complex (MHC) mol-
ecules. MHC molecules are gene
products that cells use to deter-
mine self from nonself. Millions
of exosomes scurry about within
the bloodstream, and while their
function has been somewhat of a
mystery, researchers are begin-
ning to surmise that they play an
important role in immune regula-
tion and response.

Adrian Morelli of the Thomas
E. Starzl Transplantation Institute
became intrigued by the tiny exo-
somes while researching ways to
harness dendritic cells, specialized
white blood cells that present
antigens to other immune system
cells, as a means to donor-speciﬁc
immune tolerance.

Considered the “Holy Grail”
of transplantation, tolerance
means a recipient’s immune
system fully accepts a donor
graftwithoutimmunosuppressive
drugs and without compromising
its ability to respond appropriately
to infections.

Because certain dendritic cells
have tolerance-enhancing quali-
ties, several approaches under
study involve giving recipients
donor dendritic cells that have
been modiﬁed in some way. The
idea is that the modiﬁed donor
cells would convince recipient
cells that a transplanted organ

for drugs, according to a study
by Pitt researchers published in
the Nov. 15 issue of the journal
Blood. The results provide some

foreign.

“VI/hat may be a more effec-
tive approach is to make use of
these tiny, MHC-rich vesicles

that we can siphon from donor
dendritic cells and that we have
found are captured by recipient
dendritic cells and processed in a
manner important for cell—surface
recognition,” explained Morelli,
assistant professor of surgery at
the School of Medicine. “VVhat
this means is that we can efﬁciently
deliver donor antigen using the
exosomes as our magic bullet. Fur-
ther research will determine if we
can actually inﬂuence transplant
tolerance.”

The function and mecha-
nisms for dendritic cell-derived
exosomes had never before been
elucidated, so Morelli and col-
leagues sought to do so by fol-
lowing the fate of exosomes that
they extracted from dendritic cells
of one mouse strain and injected
into the bloodstream of mice of a
different strain.

The exosomes were labeled
with a dye, and methods such as
How cytometry, confocal n1icros—
copy and immuno-electron
microscopyhelped the researchers
track their every movement and
activity within the mouse.

Very quickly and efﬁciently,
the donor exosomes were cap-
tured by one of three recipient
immune system cell types: anti-
gen-presenting dendritic cells and
macrophages, both originating in
the spleen, and Kupffer cells of
the liver.

Of particular interest to the
researchers were those exosomes
that were caught by the dendritic
cells of the spleen, the site where
dendritic cells typically present
antigens as bounty to T cells that
dmheir part«‘~.'Q.—deSIr9¥ thsforeign
invaders. Yet, what the researchers

discovered was that these dendritic
cells internalized the exosomes

instead of displaying them to T

cells, this despite the exosomes’
rich endowment of donor MHC
molecules.

Once internalized, the exo-
somes were ushered inside larger
Vesicles, special endosomes called
MHC—H enriched compartments,
where they were processed with
the dendritic cell’s own MHC
molecules.

This hybrid MHC-II mol-
ecule, now loaded with a pep-
tide of donor MHC, was then
expressed on the cell’s surface.
As one family of MHC molecules,
MHC-II serves as a beacon for a
speciﬁc population of T cells
called CD4+ T cells. Such cells
are activated during chronic rejec-
tion in a process associated with
the indirect pathway of immune
recognition.

“This ﬁnding is signiﬁcant
because current immunosuppres—
sion therapies used in the clinical
setting are not able to efﬁciently
prevent T cell activation via the
indirect pathway. Perhaps the
CD4+ T cells normally involved
in this pathway would retreat from
attack if they encountered a cell
surface marker that is of both
donor and recipient origin, such as
that which we observed following
the dendritic cell’s internalization
of the donor—derived exosomes,”
said Morelli.

Also signiﬁcant, the research-
ers report, is that the process of
internalizing the donor exosomes
does not affect maturation of the
dendritic cell. Only immature
dendritic cells can capture anti-
gens efﬁciently and are believed
to participate in the induction of
transplant tolerance. By contrast,
once mature, dendritic cells are
capable of triggering the T cell

enhance the likelihood that an
organ transplant from the same
donor will be accepted. Under a
recently awarded National Insti-
tutes of Health grant, Morelli
plans to address this question
with studies involving mice that
receive heart transplants following
infusion with exosomes from the
same donor.

In addition, animal stud-
ies conducted at Pitt by Paul
Robbins, professor of molecu-
lar genetics and biochemistry,
provide evidence that exosomes
can reverse arthritis. Morelli and
Robbins plan to collaborate on
future research.

“This is an exciting new area
of investigation, which appears
to hold great promise in the area
of transplant tolerance,” com-
mented senior author Angus W.
Thomson, professor of surgery
and immunology at the Starzl
Transplantation Institute and
the School of Medicine.

“So much more remains to be
understood, but this current study,
whereby we have offered the ﬁrst
details about the mechanism of
dendritic cell-derived exosomes,
is a signiﬁcant start.”

According to the Pitt authors,
few research groups are engaged
in active study of exosomes with
most of the research taking place
in Europe.

Student finds
new genus,
species of
amphibian

VVhile on a geology class trip,
a Pittundergraduate student came
across a previouslyunknown genus
and species of a 300—million—year—
old amphibian.

Adam Striegel, a Pitt senior
liberal studies major, found a fos-
silized skull of an ancient meat-
eating amphibian with a vicious.
set of teeth.

The fossil is only the third
300—million-year-old amphibian
skull ever found in the world,
according to David Berrnan, cura-
tor of vertebrate paleontology at
Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Museum of
Natural History.

Charles Jones, lecturer and
undergraduate adviser in the
Department of Geology and
Planetary Science, last March
led his class on a ﬁeld trip to a
newly cut road near the Pittsburgh
International Airport. During
the outing, Striegel picked up a
grapefruit-sized rock on which he
thought he saw the imprint of a
fern and showed it to Jones.

Jones immediately knew that
what Striegel had thought were
fern fronds was actually a double
row of jagged teeth — and the
rock was actually a skull. “I knew
at that moment that this would be
the nicest vertebrate fossil that I
would probably ever touch,” said
Jones.

Striegel will donate the fossil to
the museum. After the museum’s
scientists ﬁnish preparing it and
publish their ﬁndings, either the
genus or the species will likely be
named “Striegeli.” I

PEOPLE OF THE TIIVIES

George E. Klinzing, vice
provost for research and professor
of chemical engineering, has been
awarded the Particle Technology
Forum Lifetime Achievement
Award.

The award recognizes
Klinzing’s distinguished career,
contributions to particle tech-
nology research and scholarship
and outstanding leadership in
the worldwide particle technol-
ogy community.

Klinzing, who also is a fellow of
the American Institute of Chemi-
cal Engineering, has logged more
than 30 years of research and
lectured nationally and interna-
tionally on particle technology,
speciﬁcally pneumatic convey-
ing. He has authored more than
2 50 peer-reviewed papers and ﬁve
books and holds ﬁve patents and
eight copyrights.

The lifetime achievement
award was sponsored by E.I.
duPont de Nemours 8: Co.

Paul Supowitz, associate vice
chancellor for commonwealth
and city/ county relations in Pitt’s
Ofﬁce of Community and Gov-
ernmental Relations, has been
appointed to investigate irregu-
larities in Allegheny County in the
recent general election, particu-
larly those involving provisional
ballots. He was appointed by
County Executive Dan Onorato.

Prior to joining Community
and Governmental Relations,
Supowitz served as associate gen-
eral counsel at Pitt for ﬁve years.

He joins Bob King, an attor-
ney with Reed Smith law ﬁrm,

who was appointed by Country

- —Gouncilman Dave F-awcett to— the-

two-person panel.

An internationally renowned
structural biologist has been
recruited from the National Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH) to direct the
new structural biology program at
Pitt’s School of Medicine.

Angela M. Gronenborn,
professor in the Department of
Pharmacology, will oversee the
development and growth of the
structural biology program as
well as its move next year to the
Biomedical Science Tower 3.

Structural biology is a disci-
pline that explores the architecture
and organization of proteins, lipids
and nucleic acids — the building
blocks of cells —— and how they
move and interact within the cel-
lular environment.

Gronenborn is considered
an expert in nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a
method that provides information
about the physical and chemical
properties of molecules.

For the last 13 years she has
served as chief of the structural
biology section in the laboratory
of chemical physics at NIH’s
National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

While at NIH, Gronenborn
and her lab team developed 3-
and 4-dimensional NMR meth-
ods and, more recently, techniques
for macromolecule alignment
— approaches that provide sig-
niﬁcantly more detailed informa-
tion about protein structures and
are widely used by laboratories
worldwide.

In 1988, the ﬁrst protein NMR
structures to appear in the Pro-
tein Data Bank, an international
resource for biomedical research,

came from her lab. In addition, she
is credited with developing a novel
way to label DNA with isotopes,
which has made it feasible to use
heteronuclear, multidimensional
NMR spectroscopic methods
to study nucleic acids and their
complexes.

Gronenborn attended the
University of Cologne in West
Germany, where she received
undergraduate and master’s
degrees in chemistry, and a doctor-
ate in organic chemistry, sumrna
cum laude.

J. Timothy Greenamyre has
joined the faculty at the School of
Medicine as professor and chief
of the new movement disorders
division of the Department of
Neurology.

Greenamyre also will direct the
Pittsburgh Institute for Neurode-
generative Diseases, which brings
together clinical and laboratory
investigators to develop new
understandings, treatments and
methods of prevention for a wide
array of neurological diseases.

Greenamyre comes from
Emory University, where he was
professor and vice chair of neu-
rology, co-director of the Center
for Neurodegenerative Disease
and director of the movement
disorders program.

He chairs the research grants
subcommittee of the Huntington’s
Disease Society of America, and
was a member of the National
Institutes of Health Parkinson’s
disease research agenda planning
committee, the Parl<inson’s dis-
ease implementation committee
and the neurological sciences and

disorders B - study. 1 section-ofsthe.

National Institute for Neurode-
generative Diseases and Stroke.
Greenamyre’s research in-
cludes mechanisms that cause
nerve cell death in disorders such
as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and
Alzheimer’s diseases.

He received his B.S. from i
Michigan State University and '

his M.D. and Ph.D. from the
University of Michigan.

A new trail that connects
Pitt’s Bradford campus and the
community has been named after
Richard E. McDowell, president
emeritus, to recognize him for his
leadership and service both to
UPB and to Bradford.

The trail, 1.5 miles long, has
ﬁve raised walkways and three
bridges, which are being funded
through donor support and named
by the donors.

The trail extends about one
mile from the north side of the
west branch of the Tuna Creek
directly across from Onofrio
Street to Blaisdell Hall on the
Pitt-Bradford campus. After pass-
ing Blaisdell Hall, the trail crosses
a 70-foot bridge then continues
an additional half mile to Clarks
Lane on the south side of the creek
through a natural scenic area.

“I have been a longtime
advocate for the development
of a community trail, which will
connect more safely the Pitt-Brad-
ford campus to the community,”
McDowell said.

In addition to McDowell’s
longtime service as UPB presi-
dent, he also was instrumental
in establishing the Allegheny
Research and Development
Center at Pitt-Bradford, which
provides assistance to various

    

businesses and industries in
northwestern Pennsylvania.

Colleen Motter has been pro-
moted to director of the George].
Barco Center for Continuing Edu-
cation at the Titusville campus.
The continuing education ofﬁce
is part of the Department of
E n r o l 1 III e n t
Management.

Motter is
responsible for
the recruitment,
advisement and
retention of
part—time stu-
dents and for
~ . . adultenrollment
activities.

In addition, she will assist
the admissions ofﬁce with high
school visits and college fairs for
traditional students during the
peak recruiting season. Motter
will continue to manage the Barco
Center’s requests for non-credit
courses for regional businesses
and the public.

Motter has been employed at
UPT since 1992 and previously
served as assistant director of con-
tinuing education. She is a 1991
graduate of Edinboro University
of Pennsylvania.

Services.

Brian Potoski and Blair Capi-
tano, both assistant professors of

pharmacy and therapeutics, and
David Paterson, associate profes-
sor of the Division of Infectious
Diseases, School of Medicine,
received the ﬁrst-place Presi-
dent’s Award for Quality at the
UPMC Quality Fair for their
project, “Promoting Optimal
Use of Antimicrobials Through
Implementation of an Antibiotic

Amy Calabrese Donihi, assis-
tant professor of pharmacy and
therapeutics, was presented with
the inaugural 2004 Chairman’s
Award. The award, established
by Robert Weber, chair of the
Department of Pharmacy and
Therapeutics, recognizes Donihi’s
contributions to the residency
research program.

Donihi also received the ﬁrst-
place Presidential Performance
Improvement Award for Patient
Safety at the UPMC Quality Fair
for her project, “Development and
Implementation of a Standardized

gram.

Claudia Leiras, a doctoral
student in epidemiology at the
Graduate School of Public Health,
has been honored with the Ruth
L. Kirschstein National Research
Award, an individual fellowship
from the National Cancer Insti-
tute. Her research interest is in
ﬁnding markers for early cancer
susceptibility.

The primary objective of
the Kirschstein award program
is to support those with excep-
tional academic credentials and
potential for careers that have a
signiﬁcant impact on biomedical

research.

Transplant pioneer Thomas
E. Starzl, professor of surgery
at the School of Medicine and
director emeritus of the Thomas
E. Starzl Transplantation Institute
at UPMC, received the John
Scott Medal Award Nov. 19 for
his achievements in the ﬁeld of
organ transplantation.

Starzl was honored at the
American Philosophical Society
meeting.

He performed the ﬁrst human
liver transplant in 1963 and the
ﬁrst successful liver transplant
in 1967. Thirteen years later,
Starzl brought transplantation a
step forward when he introduced
anti—lymphocyte globulin and
cyclosporine, the next stage in
immunosuppressive medication
after the development of aza-
thioprine and corticosteroid.

By 1989, Starzl had introduced
the anti-rejection medication
FK506, which served to increase
survival rates for liver and other
organ transplants. This led to suc-
cessful surgeries for other types
of organ transplants, including
pancreas, lung and intestine.

The John Scott Medal Award
is given to persons whose inven-
tions have contributed in some
outstanding way to the comfort,
welfare and happiness of human-
kind. The medal carries a $15,000
award. The award committee said
Starzl’s inﬂuence on transplanta-
tion and surgical science, par-
ticularly in the area of liver and
kidney transplant, has made him
one of the most important ﬁgures
in modern medicine. I

Computational biology dept. set up

The School of Medicine has established a Department of Com-
putational Biology, making it one of the ﬁrst U.S. medical schools to
assign this newer discipline the same status as more traditional clinical
and basic science departments.

The depart1nent’s primary mission is the creation of efﬁcient
computational models that aim to identify more rational approaches
to the understanding of human biology and disease processes, and to
the development of new therapies, including drugs and vaccines.

Computational biology brings together computer science and
biological science, as well as physical and mathematical sciences, by
developing physically inspired computational models and methods
to address key biological questions and to assist in gaining better
understanding of the molecular basis of complex cellular events. Such
insight can help pinpoint the speciﬁc ﬂaws in biomolecular structure
and dynamics that are associated with genetic disorders and disease
so that more effective therapies can be designed.

The department will focus on three areas of research: computational
s“tﬂ‘tI'Ctt1‘ratl‘l3i‘0logy,‘computational genornics and systems biology with
applications to cell signaling and regulation.

Ivet Bahar, founding director of the Center for Computational
Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB), has been named the chairperson
of the new department as well as professor of computational biology.
Bahar has been a professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics
and Biochemistry.

“Our goal is to focus on the structure and interactions of proteins
and their complexes in cellular environments, and to build multi-scale
models and theories that will permit us to simulate, understand and
control biological mechanisms of action,” said Bahar. “Close coor-
dination between experiments and computations emerges as a key
requirement for accelerated progress in biomedical sciences, as the
complexity of biological events becomes clear with the rapid accu-

mulation of biological data.”
The computational biology department has seven core faculty and
more than 30 associate and afﬁliate faculty members. I
