You can put off laundry. You can

A put off sleep. But this finals week

there “is one thing you do not want to‘
put off: claiming your lostiproperty.
— That’s because the Pitt pdlice

V are having their biannual clearing of

the property room. Friday; Dec"! 15

g. ‘is the last day to claim lost goods
 before they are destroyed‘; ‘ ’

' When an item is found on cam-
pus, there are several locations in
residence halls, the
Cathedral of Learning and other

C campus. buildings where the finder

can turn in the item. People who lost

thingsshould check those bins first.

“If no oneclaims stuff after a
amount of time,

[as

iPitt policeto destro

University employee will] call us to
come pick it up,” said Lt. Ronald
Machesky, the officer who oversees
the property room.

Machesky said the officers write
a police report on the recovered
property and log it into the recov-
ered property room through a series
of locked‘. drawers. The drawers
open on two sides, much like post
office boxes.

The Pitt police are located on
ﬂoor G-1 of Posvar Hall.

Once inside, the procedure to
reclaim items is simple.

Machesky said claimants must
first check with the station’s secre-
tary, who references the item in the

station’s reporting system.

“If she can’t‘ see it there she’11
notify myself or [Sgt. Vernon
Barkley], who’«s my sergeant in

i

/

recovered property; 

charge of evidence,” Machesky

said. _ ,

In order to claim a lost item
from the property "room, students
must provide proof of ownership
and sign several papers.

“If it’s things that have a name
on it, or anything‘ like that, they’re
going to have to produce identifica-
tion for it,”VMachesky said.

Claimants, however, are
required to produce photo ID
regardless of what the item is to
provide all of the information the
police need to create a record of
who retrieved the lost property.

Police fill out a property receipt
form with every piece of evidence
that comes into the station. The
property is also tagged with a num-
ber and a court case number. When
someone claims the property, police

\

complete a property return form. ‘

The propertylreturn form reports
the item’s case numbers, the date
the item was returned, a description
of the item returned to the claimant,
as well as the; claimant’s name,
address and othejrinformation.

The individual must also sign
that they received the returned prop-
erty. _

Claimants also sign the station’s
copy of the police report and the
evidence card or the property card,
as well as the copy of the police
report that accompanies the evi-
dence. 

. The property room is not just for
lost and found, though. Any seized
illegal goods or court evidence also
goes to this department.

Professor calls for a

BRENTIN MOCK

Staff Writer

Rob Penny’s name is synonymous
with Pitt’s Africana studies department and
Pittsburgh’s Hill District. If poetry and
drama in Pittsburgh are discussed, Penny’s
name would also inevitably surface.

This unblemished name and reputation
precede the upstanding yet admirably mod-
est man who goes by, like the play written
about him, “Just Rob Penny.”

As he ﬂows into a discourse on the pre-
sent state of the black student, the passion
he exudes for the future of black youth
emanates. The spirit of struggle permeates
throughout everything he shares.

“[Students] need to ﬁnd out what their
mission is,” he said, referring to the apathy
he sees. “Their mission, of course, can’t be
the same as those in the ‘60s and ‘70s.”

The primary focus he sees for black
students is what he calls the “re-
Africanization of black people.” At the
same time, Penny sees many plights worth
upending, including International
Monetary Fund and World Bank economic
exploitation, Third—World debt, police bru-
tality, racial proﬁling and liberating political
prisoners.

Besides teaching, Penny also has
established himself as a renowned poet and
playwright. His love for poetry and drama
led him to establish the Kuntu Writers

Workshop, a staple of the Africana studies
department since its debut in 1976. The
workshop acts in conjunction with the
Kuntu Repertory Theatre run by Dr.
Vemelle Lillie. V

Under Penny and Lillie, both Kuntu
programs have produced countless novel-
ists, playwrights, poets and theater shows.
Penny, has written several plays that ran
through Lillie’s Kuntu Theatre program.
Plays like “Lil’ Willie (Armstrong Jones),”
“Diane’s Heart Dries Out Still More” and
“Good Black Don’t Crack” have all lent

completes my life and makes it perfect.”
During his sabbatical last spring, he
penned “Nefertari Rising” which ran
through Kuntu. The play dealt with a new
concept he has been pushing — what he
refers to as the “African goddess para-
digm.” He explained how he wishes for the
black female to be removed from the nega-
tive portrayal she’s usually given. _
The creative and artistic spirits over-
whelming Penny keep him from taking
more charge in the Africana studies depart-
ment. Although he was the longest running

Penny a reputation rec-
ognized across the
nation.

“Rob Penny always
wanted to write plays
that would. make people
sit up and take notice of
the social, economic and
political problems that

plague African Americans,” said Genea
Webb in an article she wrote for the
Pittsburgh Courier. ‘

Many of Penny’s colleagues said that if
he had commercialized his plays he would
be a millionaire. But Penny’s decision to
remain community-based prevents him
from chasing commercial dollars. Few
know that famed playwright August
Wilson was once an understudy to Penny.

Penny, who married as a teen—ager, has
beenwith his wife, Betty for 41 years. He
calls her “Trmamu,” Swahili for “she who

that “it is the poet in [him] which makes it
hard for [him] to be an administrative per-
son.” -
~ “Pitt gives very little recognition or
respect for the Africana studies depart-
ment,” he freely admits. “They see us as a
marginal department on the periphery of
their [European—centered] curriculum.”
Penny feels there is a gloomy relation-
ship between the Africana studies depart-
ment. and Pitt’s College of Arts , and
Sciences. He will admit, though, that there

have been certain individuals who have

more balanced curriculum

worked extensively with the department.
He credits professors like Marcus Rediker
of the history department who helped by
bringing in speakers and raising awareness
at Pitt of Mumia Abu J arnal’s case.

“Rob is like the grandfather of our
department,” said Marcia Spidell, adrninis—
trative assistant of Africana studies, “We all
look up to him, and he was my first ﬁiend
when I came here.”

Still, Penny wishes the Africana stud-
ies departrnent he entered into in the ‘70s
would have been cultivated more by th
University. -

His Kuntu Writers Workshop has
helped many poets, novelists and other
writers to get published. Rob has been
instrumental in guiding many playwrights
and having their works brought before the
public. Not only does he work closely with
Kuntu Repertory Theatre, but he also
helped establish the Black Horizon Theatre
in 1968.

. Students of the social sciences looking
to change or impact society need to know
Penny. He is a leader in his community.
Through his affiliation with the National
Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in
America, the Black Radical Congress and
the National Involvement of Afrikans, Rob
has proven himself to be a soldier for jus-
trce.

Nordenberg officially accepts a bid

for Pitt to play Iowa State in. the V

Insight.com Bowl in Phoenix on Dec.
28, ensuring Pitt’s first trip to a bowl
game since the 1997 Liberty Bowl.

Dec. 4 — Pitt’s Habitat for Humanity
Chapter begins construction on its
“Habishack,” a small plywood structure
on the Union lawn where members will

live during the week to raise awareness _

about the group and its purpose.

PROPERTY

_ Case evidence ‘is placed in a secondary, alarm-
rigged room that is more secure than the recovered

property room.

“There’s an evidence card prepared for-each piece
of evidence that lists everything that’s in the evi-

dence envelopes.

That evidence is sealed and left ‘in the evidence
room until it’s needed for court,” Machesky said.

When the case is closed, relevant evidence can be
disposed of. The evidence cannot be destroyed or'dis—
posed of until after the pending case is resolved. V

‘_‘Once the case is over and the evidence is free to
be returned, the [person] would need to be given a
court order to get it back,” Machesky said.

‘When the Pitt police seize drugs, weapons, alco-
hol and other illegal items, they are also placed in the
V secondary room.

These items are not returned, but are destroyed
with other items at the biannual clearing. The illegal
items, however, must be securely destroyed.

“We take themxto a steel mill and  we throw
them into steel furnaces and they’re burned up,”_

Machesky said.

Students who wish to claim recovered property
should contact the property room at 624-4040. _

10   OPINIONS  

EDITORIAL  
Your resolutions for 2001

The year is coming to a close, and
with ﬁnals looming, you probably
desire to indulge in a little procrastirIat—
ing. This means that it is high time to
take a few moments to re-evaluate the
past year and set goals for the next. To
help you get started, we have some sug-

‘ gestions for resolutions that everyone .

should make in 2001:

- Rally around the vendors‘ Who,
after Jan. 1, are going to be prohibited
from parking in metered spaces by a
city ordinance. The vendors are apart
of our campus community, and we
should show them our support.

° Go to Student Government
Board meetings. Get proactive instead
of just complaining about problems and
annoying things on campus.

- Ifyou are a smoker, stop smoking
under the tarps. There is not enough
ventilation and the rest of us do not rel-
ish breathing in your smoky air. Better
yet, stop smoking completely. If pre-
serving your health isn’t a good enough
motivation, then quit to save money.

0 Practice better dental hygiene. Go
beyond brushing twice a day and make‘
time in your schedule to ﬂoss.

0 Rejoice in football euphoria
when Pitt beats Iowa State at the
Insightcom Bowl on Dec. 28. Then,
continue the excitement by supporting
Pitt’s many other sports teams —‘the
soccertearns,thesvvimtearnsandso

    

on. We have a lot of non—football athlet-
ic talent at our University that tends to
be under—recognized.

- Brush up your safety skills,

Namely, look both ways before cross-
ing the street, and make sure the batter-
ies work in your smoke detector.

- Make classes more fun. ‘Start
singing spontaneously and see who
joins in, or bring candy to share. Doing
so will create a positive learning envi-
ronment from which all will beneﬁt.

- Unite to get a grocery store clos-

er to campus, so we don’t have to I I’ =  f i‘

choose between taking a bus or shop-
ping at Eddie’s.

0 Root against Penn State when
they play in a bowl game on New
Year’s Day. What? Pardon? Penn State
isn’t playing in a bowl this year? Sorry
about that.

9 Create a rivalry with Carnegie
Mellon University. The conditions are
right — CMU is right up the street from
us, and its students are easy to make fun
of, as they are nerds. Think of creative
ways to compete against them and
prove that we are better.

- All the stuﬂ you read in brochures
when you were applying here is actual-
ly true — Pitt is a close-knit communi-
ty of talented and committed students.
Let’s resolve to become even more
united, active, spirited and caring in the
coming year. A

has become increasingly enamored with “think
tanks,” citing them as a valid source of policy
evaluation and recommendation. Nothing could
be farther from the truth. Think tanks do a lot,
including obscuring thought. Many, perhaps
most, exist solely to justify some ideology. This
rationalization and justiﬁcation is the polar oppo-
site of the thought so essential to 4

good policy formulation. MISCHA
For years, universities were the
primary source for examining poli— GELM AN

cy issues. This was far from ideal,
given the ivory-tower distance from
normal life and a general left-wing bias. But, it
was far preferable to our time. Professors and old-
time scholars generally practiced free thought _—-
if they came across evidence that contradicted a
previously held assumption, they would rethink
their beliefs. '
Butthisisnotthecasewiththinktank
“scholars.” If Charles Murray found that welfare,
worked, he would have been out of a job. If
Dinesh D’Souza found that aﬂirrnative action
was beneﬁcial, he would have to kiss his fame in
right-wing circles and his wealth good-bye.’
Instead, folks like Murray and D’Souza are’ pres-
sured to selectively use facts to support their case.
The pressure is not just on the individuals but
on the think tanks themselves. The American
Enterprise Institute could never become a pop-
ulist organization, largely due to the source of
their funding. Michael Lind, a former neoconser-
vative editor, points out that “one by one every

leading neoconservative puhli cation or think tank ’

over the past decade has come to depend on
money from a few key foundations: ‘Olin, Smith-
Richardson, Bradley, Scaife  the editors have
censored themselves for fear of appearing ‘liber-
al’ and losing that critical annual grant.”

Such an arrangement is not freedom of
thought, but propaganda reminiscent of
Stalinisrn.

Thought consists of taking in all available
information and objectively analyzing it, which is
exactly what the modem think tanks do not do. If
you know what"thei;r answer willbe before they
do their research, you know the research was only

Faith supersedes fact. You know ‘a Cato -

‘report will ﬁnd that welfare is bad or that pollu-
tion will best be handled by the market. You
know the Economic Policy Institute will ﬁnd that

 Think tanks are valuable in that
 they can help take nuts out of

   
 
   
 
  

that soccer is a socialistic vice or
D’ Souza saying that the Civil Rights
Act was a bad idea. For such loons,
a sheltered environment is helpful
—— but it also is problematic in that such lunacy is
encouraged by like—nIinded folks.

Even scandals fail to shake the media’s faith
in think tanks as supposedly unbiased places of
thought. For instance, libertarian think tank
Citizens for a Sound Economy got $1 million

from Philip Morris to -oppose cigarette taxes,’

$700,000 from three Floridian sugar barons to
oppose an Everglades reclamation project and
almost $400,000 from Microsoft to oppose the
antitrust suit. Is this objective thought? As the
National Journal reported, Citizens for a Sound
Economy has often been “a ﬁg leaf for corporate
lobbying efforts.”

It’s not conservatism or libertarianism or lib-
eralism or socialism that’s wrong (though I don’t
care for any of them) — it’s that the institution of
the think tank is wrong, as it encourages any of
those mindsets to become more set ‘

Andrew Bard Schrnookler wrote, “My expe-
rience in the world of Washington think tanks
showed me that ideas often become prominent

not so much in proportion to their intrinsic merits ,

but in proportion to the wealth of the interests th
ideas serve.” _ I

So, you’ve partied like it’s 1999, and
you’ve just about eaten all your supplies
from your Y2K closet. You may ask your-
self, “What’s left to do?” Well kids, 2001 is
the start of the real millennium, and there are
plenty of cool parties and events, even in
Pittsburgh.

While most Pitt students will still be at
home on Christmas break, all of you off-
carnpus folk and commuter students are
within driving or busing distance of most of
Pittsburgh’s events. So start making plans!

- Ifyou’re looking for something to give
a charge to all your creative arts inclinations,
you need not travel any further than
Downtown. First Night Pittsburgh is going
to be a blowout this year.

First Night Inc. sponsors the event. The
non-proﬁt gnoup’s sole purpose is to. get
artists of all kinds together and throw a fam-
ily-oriented, artsy New Year’s party. First
Night is going into its seventh year in
Pittsburgh and over 200 North American
cities have their own Erst Night celebra-
tions. Over 300 performers will strut their
stuﬁ at one of 50 Downtown venues.

The event covers a huge area of
Downtown, from Stanwix Street to Seventh
Avenue. A shuttle is being provided to get.

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
   
 
   

you from event to event, which will be held
both indoors and out. It’s kind of like the arts
festival but with snow.

If you choose to come to First Night,
expect the unexpected. Everyone from the
Boilermaker Jazz Band to Elvis irnperson—
ators to Joe Grushecky and the
Houserockers will be performing. Country
western, swing and Irish/Celtic dancers will
be stomping and clopping all over the place.

The Beat 104.7 is providing the dance
party from 7 to 11:30 pm. Pitt’s Kuntu
Repertorywillbeperformingat10p.m.in
the Reed Smith lobby.

First Night Pittsburgh begins at 3 pm.
and things should die down at about 1 am
Forgoing the normal ticketing route, First
Night instead sells buttons. You can buy a
$10 button at Giant Fagle, Kaufrnanns, The
Andy Warhol Museum and lots of other
places. When you buy a button you can park
in  Downtown lots for a buck.
After Christmas the price of an admission
button goes up to $15, so don’t procrastinate.

By the way, First Night Pittsburgh is an
alcohol—free event, perfect for all you young-

sters and straight-edgers out there.

0 Carnegie Science Center is planning a
New Year’s Eve party with your brain in

mind.From8pm.until1a.rntherewillbe.

live science theater demonstrations, laser
shows in the planetarium, Ornnirnax ﬁlms
and raffles for prizes. If the weather isn’t par-
ticularly ugly, the observatory
will be open. The event is all
ages and refreshments will be

punch! Tickets‘ are $10 per
person, $8 in advance.

0 Ifyou’re more interested
in feeding your ears than your
mind, there are some local
bands playing too. The Clarks
are playing at Oakland’s Club
Laga this New Year’s.

, The Clarks have been
churning out records since
1988. The foursome‘ tour all
over the tri-state area and

have built up a loyal follow-

ing. A
They will be performing

and tickets to the all-ages show are only $12
if you buy in advance, $15 at the door.

- Nick’s Fat City in the South Side is
having a $10 show this year with Mercury,
Voodoo Babies and Engine 34. , ‘

Voodoo Babies, fronted by a very Baby
Spice—esque Lori Bernish, is a quartet of gui-

, tar-led, altema-pop. The group has played at

most of the big Pittsburgh concert events,
-including M-Squared, Three Rivers Music
and Rib festival and the Gateway Clipper
New Rock Cruise. -

The band has also toured up and down
the East Coast promoting its first album,
Super Fine Thing. It has opened for every-
one from The Marshall Tucker Band to
Christina Aguilera, and twice was the house
band for the Jenny Jones Show. 8

Voodoo Babies are anticipating the
release‘ of their second rock—, blues— and
funk-inspired album in February. Doors
open at 8 p.m.»Call Nick’s Fat City for tick-
ets. 3.

you must come to 31st Street Pub on Penn
Avenue and see The Ultimatics. These guys
won the Graffiti Rock challenge by being the
rudest, loudest, most talented guys in the
joint. The Ultimatics will be joined by
Submachine and Silver Tongued Devil.

The Ultimatics recently released their
second album, Dolls and Skulls. These
Pittsburgh guys have stayed true to their
local roots. These guys are angry and anti-
establishment, but they’re witty too.

Submachine, friends of The
Ultimatics, will be playing as well.
Rounding out the lineup is Silver Tongued
Devil. Also local, the ﬁvesome brings rock
inspired by the Stooges, The Ramones and
Motorhead. This year’s album, Red-Eyed
and Tongue-ﬁlled ' has stuff you probably
haven’t heard, but you should .

Concerts at 31st Street Pub usually start
late, 10 pm. or later and the cover is cheap.
Call for concert details but be warned —— the
bathrooms are a little, um, untidy.

0 If you aren’t interested in live perfor-
mances or ﬁnd that drinking is a form of live
entertainment, several clubs are throwing
New Year’s parties.

and DJ Derek will be spinning in the Alpine
Room. Festival Hall is for families, so you
might want to skip that room unless you like
stepping over children. There’s a teen dance
in the Rathskeller in the ski lodge, as well.
Admission is $5.

Seven Springs will be keeping its regu-
lar hours for skiing. The day session is from
9 am to 7 pm. and costs $40. The twilight
session begins at 1 p.m. and continues until
10 p.rn. and is the same price. The night ses-
sion runs from 4:30 p.m. until 10 p.rn. and
costs $25.

- Ifyou really want to impress your date
(or his or her parents) you could go to the
New Year’s Eve party at the Radisson Hotel
in Monroeville. This event is pretty swanky
for poor college students, but if you’ve got
the means, why not waste your money?

The Radisson has two overnight pack-

0 ages. Package No. 1 has entertainment by Jill

West and The Blues Attack If you choose
package No. 2, Disco Mania with DJ Bobby
V will drive you into a frenzy. This package
is a more dance—oriented event, so it will
probably also draw the younger crowd

Both packages cost a mere $219 plus
tax. This price covers overnight accommo-
dations, dimer for two, New Year’s dessert,
party favors, 10 drink tickets (there’s a cash
bar for when yours run out), a champagne
toast at midnight and a balloon drop.

If you want to upgrade your accommo-
dations, an overnight stay in a suite will run
you $239 — plus tax, of course.

- If you have the means to leave the
state, keep your eye on the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame in Cleveland. 'lhe_lineup is not
yet conﬁrmed but Ticketmaster is selling
tickets for $50 each and they’re guaranteeing
live bands. VV1th the clout the museum has in
acquiring musical stuff, it should bring in
some good bands.

0 Suppose you are of the somewhat pen-
niless persuasion —— you could throw your
own party. Mellinger’s in South Oakland
features holiday beers, The Wing Pitt has all
the wings you and your drunken little friends
could devour and Subway and Giant Eagle
both have party trays available. One tip -—
don’t call at 10 pm. on New Year’s Eve
unless you want a platter full of sourdough
crust and leftover pepperoni.

Papennart touts its extensive collection
of holiday decorations, if you picked through
a few dollar stores, you could probably
scrape together the rest of the things you
need for a kitschy party.

Don’t moan and complain about the
lack of stuff to do for New Year’s. There are
plenty of activities going on and more and
more venues are announcing their holiday
festivities every day. So, go out, have some
shrimp. Just watch yourself on the slopes,

and try not to puke off the side of the boat

Contributing Editor

It is not terribly difﬁcult to make a
run-of—the—niill adventure—type movie
these days — especially one called
“Proof of Life."

Begin with an aging hippie with
bouncy blond tendrils and a penchant
for wearing outrageous weight—lifting—
type belts (Meg Ryan, ,as Alice
Bowman). Pair her, with’ an ex—Peace
Corps husband (Peter Bowman,
played by David Morse)
who has now turned to
the “dark side” by
building a darn sub— A‘
contracted by an oil .
company.

Add typical marital
stress and let stew in a
humid South American
Third World nation dubiously named
“Tecala.”

Introduce some desperate Tecalan

IRA-types to kidnap said husband and
hold him for outrageous ransom.

“(.¢‘I':!-‘:)l-',
;’r:r::ya444/a..11.4,.)/4 vv./.

rt:-44; it-v.:,ii/...

  
  
  
   
  

Enter a tall, dark and handsome
Australian expatriate (Russell Crowe, as
Terry Thorne) who has abandoned his
life as a British soldier to pursue work in
the field of “K&R” (kidnapping and
ransom). His job is to negotiate with the
terrorists to bring Alice’s husband home.

Now throw in husband’s borderline
psychotic older sister (Janis Bowman,
played by Pamela Reed) and a trigger-
happy vigilante sidekick named Dino
(David Caruso). Add a few pedestrian
plot twists, spice things up with some
constantly brewing sexual tension and
close with the requisite tug—at—your—
heartstrings ending.

Given the lackluster plot and tweak
romantic subplot, it is not surprising that
most of the pre—release buzz concerning
“Proof of Life” focused primarily on the
real—life romance of stars Ryan and
Crowe. ' A

In an ironic turn of art truly irnitat-

ing life, Ryan and Crowe —
who share a small on-
screen, adulterous
ﬂirtation — were
reported to have
shared a serious
0 f f — s c r e e n
romance leading
to divorce for Ryan
--" and husband Dennis
Quaid. Reports: of . the romance
surfaced long before film trailers did,
and will likely outlast the film itself.

However, despite the typical brood-

ing outback accent that so many Crowe

fans are fond of; most will be disap-
pointed that the on-screen romance
pales "in comparison with the off—screen
one. -

Ryan does an adequate job of por-
traying the tom, nearly bereaved"wife,
jaunting through Tecala in ridiculous
get-up after ridiculous get-up and
matching ‘hiking boots.

‘The best performance in the film by
far is given by Morse, playing the
abducted husband. He morphs from
upstanding, quasi—businessman to

hunched over, hairy abductee with
seamlesls grace. ,

Most surprising, though, is the re-
appearance of,Caruso as wild man Dino.
Spouting lines like “Got ‘em!’’ and
“That was fun” while gunning down
dozens of Tecalans; he comes off as ‘a

funny stereotype of ethnocentric

American capitalism. , .
Given the ho—huin plot and script,

unless you salivate upon hearing an

Aussie accent, save your money and’

wait to watch “Proof of Life” on video.

The album does have its high
points, or high point, with the first
track, “Christmastime.” It begins
with an old—style “Fa la la la la”
carol featuring violins, a viola and a
cello and explodes into a pop song.
Complete with a rap for a bridge, it
should crowd the airwaves as radio
stations play Aguilera at an alarm-
ing rate. ’ .

The problem in starting the

album off with the best song is it .

makes it hard to resist the urge to
shut it off afterward.

Aguilera had a hand in writing
“This Year,” another of the new
tracks. It’s a love song about wanti-
ng to avoid spending Christmas
alone. The only thing halfway
decent about the song is a kinky

line toward the middle, which was

probably Aguilera’s only contribu-
tion to the lyrics: ‘‘You’ll be my

a high voice range, she tries her
pr-best at “Oh Holy Night”__ — with
j very little success. It-sounds like a
.. warm—up test to make sure she can
 "hit the ‘highest notes possible.
‘Aguilera recorded the album
while onaworld tour. This makes
the album lack continuity and feel
thrown together.

She even has the gall to recite
the “Our Father” prayer in the mid-
dle of “Oh _Holy Night.” If you
haven’t caught Aguilera’s act on
stage in her skimpy outfits and
vixen attitude, you might be fooled
into thinking she’s quite the-re1i—
‘ gious follower.

The closest Aguilera gets to
doing a tolerable rendition of a
carol is “The Christmas Song.”
Then she ruins it with the album’s

_ ___finale, the amusing “The Christmas
Song (Holiday Remix).”

A holiday remix of a traditional
song is the best way to alienate tra-
ditionalists and get radio play. So
toast your next glass of eggnog to
Aguilera’s marketing directors, but
you should hope for a lump of coal
instead of this album as a Christmas

gift.

You can bet that Pitt’s opponent in
the Insight.com Bowl on Dec. 28 will be
very anxious come kickoff time.

Iowa State, out of the Big 12
Conference, has not been to a bowl
game in 22 years.

The Cyclones’ last trip to the
postseason was in the 1978
Hall of Fame Bowl, in
which they fell to Texas

A&M, 28-12.     _.

yards and eight touchdowns. He also ran
for 10 touchdowns and 381 yards on 78
carries. ’
Rosenfels has an All-Big 12 receiv-
er to throw to in J .J . Moses, who had 53
receptions for 775 yards and four touch-
downs in the Cyclones’ 11 games.
The Cyclones also feature a top-
notch running back in Ennis Haywood.
Haywood appeared in 10
games, averaging 123.7
yards a game and
scored eight touch-
downs on 229 carries.
Haywood is also very

 

In fact, the Cyclones
have never won a bowl

game in four chances
between 1971-1978.

Former Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors
led ISU to its first ever I
bowl in 1971 in the Sun Bowl
against Louisiana State, where the
Cyclones lost, 33-15.

A year later, ISU fell to Georgia
Tech in the Liberty Bowl by a slim, 31-
30, margin and lost the 1977 Peach
Bowl as well, to North Carolina State,
24-14.

This year, the Cyclones (8-3) defeat-
ed the teams they should have and lost to
the three teams ranked above them.

The game, held in Bank One
Ballpark in Phoenix, is the first meeting
between the two teams.

Iowa State is led by quarterback
Sage Rosenfels. Rosenfels completed

172 of 333 passes this season for 2,298

careful with the ball as are
the Cyclones as a team.
They fumbled the ball just
seven times all year, losing
five of them.

On defense, Iowa State is led by
Reggie Hayword. Hayword led the team
with 90 tackles for a loss, including 55
unassisted tackles, and led sacks with
seven.

James Reed added 86 tackles, 46 of
them unassisted to place second on the
team.‘

In the secondary, Marc Timmons led
the Cyclones with three interceptions,
one of which was returned for a touch-
down. He also added 58 tackles.

Iowa State defeated just one bowl
team, UNLV, which the Cyclones
topped in the second game of the season,
37-22. -The other three bowl teams the
Cyclones played all resulted in defeats.
Nebraska beat the Cyclones, 49-27,
Texas A&M topped ISU, 30-7 and
Kansas State ran all over Iowa State, 56-
10.

For the Panthers (7-4), stopping
Haywood and keeping Rosenfels in the
pocket will be the keys to a successful
day on defense.

To do that, defensive end Bryan
Knight must be able to put consistent
pressure on Rosenfels and force him to
throw or run out of the pocket.

Also, the Panthers’ secondary must
not let the speedy ISU receivers behind
them for an early score.

"Pitt will have an “ace in the hole” in
Paul Rhoads, Panthers’ defensive coor-
dinator. Rhoads was on the Cyclones
sideline for the last-ﬁve seasons, serving

DAVE MCANL/PHTO D10

Mark Ponko, and the Pitt defense will look to shut down the ISU attack.

as their secondary coach for the previous
four years.

Rhoads knows many of the
Cyclones’ players, and said that should
help in preparation for the game.

“On defense, you want- to know
everything you can about what you’re
going up against, so I’ll help any way I
can on both sides of the ball,” Rhoads
said.

On offense, Biletnikoff Award win-
ner Antonio Bryant should be able to get
open against the Cyclones, giving John
Turman or David Priestley a big target
downﬁeld. If Bryant is double covered,
as he has been throughout the season,
senior Latef Grim will be a threat
against 1-on-1 coverage.

The decision on whether to start
Turman, a senior, or Priestley, a junior,
has not been made yet, but both will
probably play.

If running back Kevan Barlow has a I

game anything like his regular-season
ending performance against West
Virginia, Iowa State will have its work
cut out.

Pitt topped two bowl teams in
Boston College and West Virginia, while

losing to two bowl teams in Virginia
Tech and Miami.

All four of Pitt’s losses came against
teams with winning records, however.
Syracuse and North Carolina went 6-5
for the season, but were shut out of the

. bowl games.

The Panthers are looking for their
ﬁrst bowl game victory since a win in
the 1989 John Hancock Bowl over
Texas A&M by a score of 31-28.

Pitt’s last bowl appearance was a
41-7 defeat at the hands of Southern
Mississippi in the 1997 Liberty _Bowl.

Kickoff is scheduled for 7:15 p.m.
and the game will be broadcast live by

’ ESPN.

The BOB, as Bank One Ballpark is
known, will be hosting its first football
game. The stadium serves as the home
park for baseball’s Arizona
Diamondbacks, and temporary bleach-
ers will be added along the ﬁeld to make
it seem more suited for football.

“We’re very excited about playing
in the city of Phoenix, playing a talented
team like Iowa State and competing in

the Insight.com Bowl,” said Pitt head _

coach Walt Harris.

Thiesen perseveres to lead volleyball team

FRAN AIELLO

Staff Writer

Marcia Thiesen and Pitt’s volleyball team
enjoyed a special season this year. With some
tremendous action and great talent, the Panthers
went to the Big East Tournament with Thiesen lead-
ing the way, setting numerous records and making
countless great plays on the court against some
tough Big East competition. U

Thiesen, an outside middle
hitter from Chatham, Ontario, fin-
ished her career with some very
impressive stats and set herself
apart from all other female athletes,
being voted to numerous All-
Toumament teams, All-Star teams
and finally being voted Female
Athlete of the Fall by the Pitt News
sports staff.

Pitt’s No. 11 continued this year
right where she left off last
year. As a senior, Thiesen averaged a
team high of 3.33 digs per game overall
and 3.45 in Big East action. Thiesen post-
ed 19 double—doubles for the 2000
Panthers and was second on the teamwith
3.99 kills averaged throughout the season.
She led the team in kills in the Big East, averaging
4.48 per game. .
She was also twice named Big East Player of the
Week. ‘

Thiesen made her mark in the Pitt record books

   
   
 

as the third player in history to have 1,000 career
kills as well as 1,000 career digs. Reaching this in
late October, she was honored before a home game
and then went on to win Co-Player of the Week
that same weekend. ~

Even as a freshman and sophomore Thiesen had
some impressive stats. As a sophomore in 1998,
Thiesen saw action in 29 of the Panthers’ 30 match-
es and lead the team with 3.47 kills per game in
matches overall and 3.50 kills per game in Big East
competition.

She also led the team in
attempts and earned Big East Co-
Player of the Week for her efforts.

Her freshman year, Thiesen

started in all of the Panthers
matches. She finished among the
league leaders in digs with 360 in
conference matches as well as
leading the team. She also served up 27
aces and made an early appearance to_
the All-Tournament Team at the
University of Wisconsin Invitational.
Thiesen’s position as outside hitter
has been kind to her over her four years /at
Pitt. A coveted spot among volleyball
players, she has been able to compete at
the position for the entire time.

In high school Thiesen was named a
National All-Star her junior year and contributed
greatly as a member of a team in the 1997 Canadian
Games. ' ..

Thiesen plans to continue to study here at Pitt in
order to get a degree in business management and

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM

The Pitt News

Lousaka Polite is a man of focus.

This focus permeates itself on and off
the ﬁeld. Upon ﬁnding out that he had
been voted Male Freshman Athlete of the
Year’ by the Pitt News sports staff, the
Woodland Hills native responded with
appreciation and modesty.

“This is really a great honor for me. I
am very pleased, but basically my job is
just to go out and work hard to help my
team win. Anything on top of that is just a
bonus,” Polite said.

Polite has come a long way, consider-

success keys Panthers

He also caught 16 passes for 118 yards.
"And on a team that included the likes of
Antonio Bryant, Latef Grim and Kevan
Barlow, Polite ﬁnished ﬁfth. in total
offense.

But the contributions Polite makes_to
the Pitt football team go far beyond the
oﬁensive statistics. Polite is a classic,
workhorse player who does the little
things that don’t show up in the stats.
Often lining up alone in the backﬁeld in
three and four wide-receiver sets, Polite
did a tremendous job of picking up the
blitz and giving John T‘urman and David
Priestley time to throw the ball to any
number of Pitt’s tremendous wide
receivers and tight ends. He also proved to
be a solid run-blocker, helping Barlow to
rush for over 1000 yards this season.

Despite his image as a guy who can
get it done in the trenches, Polite doubled
his value this year as not only a great
blocker, but a legitimate multi-purpose

back who can come up big in the clutch. »

Polite can catch the ball out of the back-
ﬁeld, as he showed in a big way against
arch rival Penn State. In a game that was

characterized by great defense, Polite V

caught three passes for 40 yards in the 12-
0 shutout victory, Pitt’s first over the
Nittany Lions since 1988.”

Polite’s biggest game of the season

against Rutgers. After turning the ball over
seven times, Pitt allowed Rutgers to nar-

. row the Panther lead to .23-16 late in the

game. But with 4:48 left in the fourth
quarter, Polite scored his lone touchdown
of the season with a 1-yard plunge that put
the game out of reach and helped secure a

’29-16 victory for the Panthers. He also

rushed the ball eight times for 43 yards
and caught two passes for 10 yards again
the Scarlet Knights. ’
Polite says that his coaches and team-
mates such as Barlow and running backs

coach Kenny Carter were instrumental in '
helping in his adjustment and securing his »

success‘ this season.

“Kevan Barlow really took me under
his wing this year, which was huge
because he was a senior and a really good

. back. He helped me out and made me feel

comfortable in the offense,” Polite said.
“Coach Carter also helped me out tremen-

. without question came in a Big East battle a -

dously in teaching me offensive concepts .

and schemes.” '

Polite neglected to talk about the

. prospects for Pitt next season, instead
V looking toward the bowl game.

“Well, I’m obviously looking forward
to next year, but we’ve still got ‘one more

/game left. Right now I’m thinking more

about that,” Polite said.

Polite has a rare combination of nat-’
ural ability, a great attitude and a tremen-

dous work ethic. \V1th three years of eligi-

— bility left and the Pitt football program on
the rise, Lousaka Polite should prove to be.
a force to be reckoned with at the fullback '

position in the Big East.

Agredano leads team in points in first year

MATTHEW SCHLIESMAN
I Staff Writer

Annette Agredano was playing

in her first ‘game of her soccer career _.

at Pitt in her hometown of Tucson,.

Ariz., when she found herself racing .
. toward the goal during overtime in a

1-1 tie with Arizona. »
Leah Greenspoon was in the
vicinity and dished a pass to

Agredano who’ then» promptly sent
I the ball sailing past Wildcat goal-

keeper Shannon Monti forthe game
winner. And in almost storybook
fashion, Agredano’s rise to the top

_ of Pitt’s women’s soccer began.

Agredano is proudest_ of that
moment in her first year of competi-
tion at Pitt, but her performances in
the 15 other games she played in for

A the women’s soccer team earned her

the title Female Freshman Athlete of
the Fall by the Pitt News sports
staff. ' .
Agreda-no lead the Panthers in
points this season with 11. She is
tied with Cande Ruiz and Jacqueline
Fix with four goals as the team’s
leading scorer -and also had three
assists in a (6-12-1 overall, 1-7-l

’ Big East) year for-the women’s soc-

cer team. . _

“The season didn’t go as
planned,” Agredano said. ‘‘‘I wish we
could have won. more games. But we
did well and I think we’re rebuild-
ing every year. I just wanted to do as
much as I could for the team.”

The Tucson native soon proved
she didn’t need the desert heat to

score when she had 10 shots and a -
Robert A

goal in a 3-2 victory over
Morristhe next week. -

9 Over the next two weeks she
pitched in an assist in games against
Seton Hall and Rutgers and had a
goal and assist in a 3-2 double over-
time victory over Villanova. After a
two-week dry spell she finally
scored her fourth goal of the year in
2-0 victory over Sacred Heart.

. Agredano’s road to Pitt started
when she was a freshman in high

school; She had been playing soccer
since youth, and she was invited to

participate in the Arizona Olympic '

Development Program. .

The program gathers girls from
around the nation and trains them on
regional teams in the hope that one.

day they can be good enough to play 1

for the U.S. Olympic team.

‘Agredano’s regional ODP team head

coach was Amy Almond, a member
of the national team. .

Yet even with all of her impres-
sive ‘soccer skills, it was tough for
Agredano when she arrived at Pitt
last season. She was forcedto take a

“We might not have

up against that kind of com-
petition,” Agredano said.

 

“I’ve played with some of the girls

regional team.” ,

The season has been over for

Agredano has been hard atawork lift-

Although the team failed the next
week against North Carolina, Bryant
didn’t stop putting up big numbers.

He was named Big East
Offensive Player of the Week after
making eight catches for 212 yards,
including an 84-yard touchdown. _

That set up a showdown on Nov.
11 at the Orange Bowl against the
No. 2 Miami Hurricanes. Bryant,
who played high school football at
Northwestern High in Miami, was
excited to be playing with his friends
and family in the crowd.

' But the excitement came out neg-
atively, as Bryant suffered from a
few drops in the first half and fin-
ished the game with just four recep-
tions, as the Panthers fell to the
Hurricanes, 35-7.

The loss was Pitt’s third in a row.
The Panthers needed to win at least
one of their remaining two games to
have ashot at a postseason ‘bowl
game. Bryant made sure of that, as
he had two" more solid games en
route to a pair of Pitt victories, giv-
ing the team a 7-4 record at the end
of the regular season.

Against Temple on Nov. 18, the
Pitt offense struggled for the entire
game, but a 15-yard touchdown
catch by Bryant was all of the scor-
ing that was necessary for a 7-0 vic-
tory. »
