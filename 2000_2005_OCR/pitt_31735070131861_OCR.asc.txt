Motorists on Centre Avenue last Friday

morning might not have cared about ser- ~

vice employees’ health care costs — but
they did care about being late to work.

Police arrested 17 people for blocking
traffic and failing to disperse from a rally
that drew more than 200 members of
Pittsburgh’s chapter of the Service
Employees International Union. The mem-
bers, representing Pitt "service workers as
well as Downtown janitors, gathered out-
side the ofﬁces of the UPMC Health Plan
to protest proposed cost increases for
employees’ family health care.

“One of the issues is that health care is
becoming unaffordable for someone who
makes $500 a week —— that’s what their
people make,” ‘Tom Hoffman, a deputy
trustee for the Service ' Employees
International Union, said. “What we want
is affordable family health care, and this is
not.” E

The service workers arrived around 8
a.m. at the UPMC Health Plan offices,
located Downtown at. One Chatham

‘ Square, to deliver an open letter addressed

to Pitt and UPMC. Hoffman said the letter
contained “thousands” of signatures and
represented Pitt service employees’

demand for affordable family health care. I

Members or the Service Employees International Union blocked traffic outside the_UPMC Health
Plan offices Downtown, protesting health insurance cost increases for Pitt service employees.

 

I.«~« 13.2-e IL

When building officials would not per-
mit the employees to deliver their letter, the
group instead rallied on Centre Avenue,
drawing attention by blocking the ﬂow of
traffic and causing delays all the way up
the street. ‘ , .

UPMC declined to comment on the
rally, saying it was a matter between the
employees and Pitt, and referring all calls
to Pitt Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs
Robert Hill. Hill could not be reached for
comment.

. .‘‘Pitt is the employer, but Pitt and
UPMC are pretty closely related,”
Hoffman said about UPMC’s response.

According to a proposed employee
health care plan scheduled to go into effect
July 1, service workers will go from paying
$110 a month to $192 a month for the most
popular family plan — a cost increase of
75 percent. UPMC Health Plan will contin-
ue to provide the health insurance -exclu-
sively. ' '

The service workers, who have not yet
agreed to the new healthplan, have been
negotiating a new contract since last year,
to replace the current 3-year contract with
UPMC that expires in June. They are on a
month-to—month extension and plan to seek
an injunction to delay the contract agree-
ment past July, according to Hoffman.

Cigarette tax
could reach
four dollars

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

Students often comb the convenience
stores of Oakland, in search of cheap ciga-

rettes. Their quest could soon become even _,
more difficult. The tax on cigarettes may rise ’

once more.

» Pennsylvania’s cigarette tax is currently a
dollar per pack. In July 2002, Pennsylvania
increased the tax by 69 cents per pack, and
state legislators are considering raising the
tax again.

Recently, in a letter to Gov. Ed Rendell,
Sen. Vincent Hughes proposed an increase in
cigarette taxes to help meet the basic health
insurance needs of Pennsylvania citizens.

The money will go toward offering
health beneﬁts for an additional 800,000
adults, providing prescription drug coverage
for low—income disabled adults, and pro-
grams aimed at reducing the number of teens

' who smoke.

A bill including a $1 cigarette tax
increase will be sent to the Senate Public
Health and Welfare Committee some time
this week, ‘according to Niles Schore, the
minority chief counselor for_ the committee.

“I would imagine some college students
would stop smoking due to the price increase,
but if people want to smoke, they are going
to,” Schore said. “Certainly, this will not
eliminate young people’ from smoking, but it
will deter them from starting to smoke at all.”

E The Campaign for a Smoke Free
Pittsburgh, the American Cancer Society and
other anti-smoking activist groups are also
campaigning for and supporting the tax
increase, according to Schore.

“They are less interested in how the
money is used. They just want to see people,
young kids especially, stop smoking,” Schore
said.

Outside of the legislative office,
Pittsburghers’ thoughts on the issue stretch
across the board. Most of the time, opinions
are divided between smokers and nonsmok-
ers.

“I think it’s a good idea to raise the taxes
[on cigarettes], because it’s a bad habit, and
this will give smokers a reason to quit,” Pitt
senior Lauren Ohaya said.

 Emergency contraceptive pill   

challenged atVirginia schools

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

To say that pregnancy is life-chang-
ing is an understatement. .
The Student Health Center offers

. emergency contraceptive pills to prevent

pregnancy among students. Failure to
offer these pills would greatly impact the
lives of the young women requesting
them. 

For some time, Student Health has
offered emergency contraception, also

. known as the “morning-after pill,” which

cuts the risk of pregnancy when taken
within 72 hours of unprotected sex. For a
victim of assault , or a student whose
method of birth control failed —— or didn’t

exist — emergency contraception can
prevent the life-altering effects’ of preg-
nancy.

But after recent pressure, largely
from abortion opponents and pro—choice
politicians, many college administrators
have questioned whether student health
facilities should continue to offer this
form of emergency contraception, which
was developed more than 30 years ago.

James Madison University, a tax—sup-
ported state school in Harrisonburg, Va.,
stopped offering the pill in April, after
Delegate Robert Marshall, a republican
from northern Virginia, sent a letter about

‘ the drug to  President "ll-,;"'inwood
‘Rose. In the letter, Marshall claimed that

emergency contraceptive pillsca. se abor-
tions. 
’According to federal regulations,
emergency contraception prevents preg-
nancy and does not tenninate it. The med-
icine, which is taken in two‘ doses, 12
hours apart, blocks the ovary from releas-
ing an egg or prevents an egg’ from attach-
ing to the uterus and growing. Studies
have shown no increasedriNsl,<, to, afetus if
the medicine is taken onciefpregnancy is
established,‘so it carmot cause ‘an abor-
tion, according to Pitt’s Student Health
Service Web site: www.studhlth.pitt.edu.

On April 18, JMU’s board of trustees
Voted 8 to 6 in favor of ordering the carn-
pus health center to\stop supplying stu-
dents with emergency contraception,
which had been available at the-‘school’s
health center for eight years.. ” i

In response to student protests and a
petition, JMU’s trustees have since per-
mitted the school to resume distribution
of the pill. The controversy, "however,
remains an issue for universities in
Virginia and across the nation.

Officials at Pitt’s Student ;;Health
Center have not felt any pressure to stop
offering emergency contraception, said
Dr. Kanitta Charoensiri, a senior physi-
cian with Student Health Services. She
added that students can now purchase a
prescription in advance, for use on week-
ends" or holiday, when Student Health is

closed and the medicine might be more
difficult to find. While some universities,
including JMU, encourage testing for
sexually-transrnitted diseases and require
students to undergo counseling, Pitt limits
counseling for students seeking prescrip-
tions to a brief discussion about the med-
icine and the proper way to take it.
Included in each package is a pregnancy
test, according to Charoensiri.

I Pitt ofﬁcials revised the school’s pol-
icy on prescribing emergency contracep-
tion in June, 2001, after more than two
years of student lobbying. Although the
pills were available before 2001, the
school did not have a written prescription
policy, and 1 students reported frequent
problems getting prescriptions, which
were not available in advance.

According to a Student Health
Service classroom survey of about 290
students at Pitt, 11 percent of sexually
active students said they or their partners
had used emergency contraception.
Charoensiri did not‘ know how many stu-
dents request prescriptions for emergency
contraception each year, but described the
number as "‘quite a lot.” She said she does
not believe the drug encourages unpro-
tected sex, but instead functions as addi-
tional backup for students at risk for preg-
nancy. '

In May, Virginia Attorney General
Jerry Kilgore issued a memorandum to
state colleges, asserting that university
distribution of emergency contraception
does not violate V1rginia’s informed con-
sent abortion law, which requires women
to ‘review information about abortion
risks and alternatives and wait 24 hours
before undergoing an abortion. The deci-
sion to distribute emergency contracep-
tion lies in the hands of each college’s
board of trustees, according to Kilgore.

‘Pennsylvani'a’s informed consent
law, which closely resembles the law in
Virginia, requires any woman seeking an

abortion to undergo counseling on risks '

and alternatives, ‘then wait 24 hours
before having the abortion.

Emergency contraception is available
at Pitt’s Student Health Service
Pharmacy, weekdays from 9:00 a.m. until
5:00 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am.’
until 3 p.m. _

Both Preven and Plan B contracep-
tion are available at the pharmacies at
Rite Aid and CVS in Oakland, for a
slightly higher price than offered by
Student Health Services. More informa-
tion about emergency contraception is
available from the Student Health Service
ofﬁce at (412) 383-1800, or the 24-hour
Emergency Contraceptive Hotline at
(888) 668-2528.

The pill is for emergency use only. It

does not work as well when used as a,

standard birth control method, and is not
recommended for regular use. '

Semple residents use caution

JONATHAN CHECK
Staff Writer

Angelo Harris wasn’t surprised by the
three incidents of armed robbery that
occurred within hours of each other on his
street.

S “It just makes me aware that Semple is
one of the most shady, ghetto streets in
Oakland,” he said.

Harris, a Community College of
Allegheny County’ student, has grown
accustomed to hearing about occasional‘
incidents of robbery’ and violence on his
street over the course of the  years he
has lived in South Oakland.

A The recent attacks are just another
expected feature of living on the weathered
Oakland street ﬂanked by McKee Place and
Meyran Avenue, hesaid. But other residents
reacted more seriously to the robberies.

“It’s scary,” said Pitt senior TJ. Hoopes.
“It makes you think twice about going out.”

Hoopes has been more vigilant since the

robberies, closing and locking the door of his

Semple Street house more often than he
usedto,butheiseagertogetonwit:hhis
everyday life. .

He added that, like Harris, he knows
crime sometimes comes with the turf on
Semple. . »
Carl Manawelian, who graduated in
May, was less acquiescent about the rob-
beries, which he said changed his opinion of

the neighborhood.

“I was shocked,” he said. “I always

thought this neighborhood was safe.”
.. Manawelian expressed concern about
the violent nature of the crimes .— the fact
that guns and knives were involved —- and
the short time frame and close proximity in
which they occurred.

“We always say it’s just a community of
students who live together, but now it seems
like something diﬂ’erent," he added.

“It’s kind of disappointing that it could
happen in such a small area,” said Brian
Jourdan, one of Manawelian’s housemates.
He added that he thought some of the inci-_
dents could have been prevented.‘ ~

Manawelian suggested beeﬁng up
police presence with foot and bike patrols to
secure the area and make residents feel safer.

These Semple Street residents exhibited.
a range of emotions, from resignation to ﬂre

fact that violent crime occurs in Oakland,‘to _
fear about the likelihood of future incidents. P

. But, for the time being, none of ﬂreir
comments indicate that they feel corrrpletely
safe. ' , '

While Manawelian and  housemates
attested to seeing more patrol cars on the
street recently, and Harris noticed a broken.
streetlight was repaired after the incident,

none of them has seen enough of an increase » '

in police presence to calm their fears or
change their opinions about their block

But there’s more to the operation than
meets the eye, according to Pitt police Chief
Tim Delaney.

Delaney described a uniﬁed and com-

prehensive eifort by both city and Pitt police
to secure the area Police cars patrol more
frequenﬂy, while ofﬁcers in unmarked police
vehicles, parked in inconspicuous locations,
watch the streets into the early hours of the
morning, as do plainclothes-police working
the beat on foot. .

The message is in the medium, he said.
By patrolling the area covertly, the police
can ensure an optimum‘ level of protection
while allowing residents to return to their
daily lives. - - .

“There is a ﬁne line between public
safety and civil rights,” he said, referring to
the careful balance police must achieve
between vigilance and reason. The police do

Pittemployees call on state

to ease health care problems

Rally, page 1

“On one hand, you look at being
arrested for one day; on the other hand,
you see going 365 days without health
care for your family.” Hoffman said,
relating his response to a person who
asked why the employees chose to pre-
sent their complaints by sitting in the
street.

Neither UPMC nor Pitt has
responded to the rally, Hoffman said,
but the union members plan to rally at

the state ofﬁce building on June 13,
when they will call on the state govem-
ment to get involved in the general
problem that Hoffman called a “nation-
al crisis in health care.”

Of the 1,270,000 people living in
Allegheny County, 150,000, or 12.5 per-
cent, did not have health care in 2002,
according to a report from the
Allegheny County Health Department.
Among all Pennsylvania residents, 9.2
percent lived without health care in
2002. A ~

Money from cigarette tax to fund
health benefits, medical programs

Cigarette, page 1

or not, many students seem to be con-

‘ fused by the motivation behind the pro

posal.

“It’s backwards that they are taking
money from cigarette taxes and putting it
toward health beneﬁts,” Julia Wilson, a
nonsmoking senior at Pitt, said.

‘”I'hat’s like taking proﬁts from diet
supplements to open a restaurant,” Wilson
added. '

Many smokers, both on and off cam-
pus, are unhappy about the proposed tax.

“Who do they think they are? I
already pay too much for a pack of
smokes now. It’s almost $5 a pack now,”
Pitt sophomore Gary Ellis said. “There
has to be some other way the state can
raise the money for other people’s health
beneﬁts.” p

0 Although the current proposal sug-
gests raising the state cigarette tax from

$1 to $2, eﬁective July 2003, Schore said
another proposal that would eventually
raise the tax to $4 is in the works.

“We want to make smoking as unap- ‘ H

pealing as possible to young teens,”
Schore said.

Although raising the cigarette tax
might deter young adults from adopting
the habit, there are many dissatisﬁed
adults who have been avid smokers for
years and feel that they should not have to
pay additional taxes.

“I’ve smoked for years and prices
keep going up for stupid reasons,” Chad
Young, a 2001 Pitt graduate, said. “If
you’re going to tell me that they are rais-

ing cigarettes costs to make cigarettes bet- I

ter or stronger, okay then, but not to pay
people’s health insurance.”

Petitions, both in favor of and against ,

the tax,» are circulating throughout the city.

students can forge a strong, formidable net-
work to ﬁght crime, -assisting each other in
the future to ensure the safety of Semple
Street and the well-being of its people.

“I hope the real story for us is not

Racetrack should be built without mining

In order to cash in on the. slot
machines that the State Legislature may
or may not legalize at racetracks, the city
wants to build a horse-racing track on an
area in Hays overlooking East Carson
Street.

Mayor Tom Murphy advocates
clearing this area by allowing a Beaver
County developer to go forth with his
proposed plan — peeling rock, soil and
trees off, excavating coal found there via
strip mining and leveling it for develop-
ment.

Although this project, should it be
approved, would be overseen by the
Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources, the environ-
mental impact of this action would not
justify the limited returns reaped by the
Clty. V

Charles Betters, the developer,
wants to strip mine the area in a process
that would remove 13 million cubic
yards of earth, according to a June 3 arti-
cle in the Post-Gazette.

The area in question was previously
the site of a coal mine. Betters plans to
tap into the remaining coal seam. In
addition, he proposed remedying prob-
lems left behind by the other mining
companies, such as extinguishing an
underground mine fire and ﬁlling pollut-
ed mine shafts. There are also plans for
a 200—acre park surrounding the area.

These measures are not enough to
quash concerns surrounding strip mines.

Coal mining of any sort entails environ-
mental problems: sulfuric acid runoff
into surrounding rivers, erosion when
root systems are removed and pollutants
leaking into groundwater.

Murphy supports the plan, saying it i

would garner revenue for the city. These
revenues would be temporary, as the
mine would "be ﬁlled in after the. coal
was ‘excavated. Also, should mines pro-
duce runoff or erosion, the city might
have to shoulder the clean—up cost,
which would consume the revenues col-
lected.

The racetrack, and the possibility of
the slot machines, would be the city’s
main beneﬁt from the mine. Building a
track is already a risk — public interest
could make or tank the track, making it
a revenue source or drain. Moreover, it
would be in direct competition with
established tracks, both in- and out-of-
state. A

The mine would beneﬁt the compa-
ny, not Pittsburgh. Jobs would be tem-
porary and workers could be imported
from outside of the state.

On top of taking an economic gam-
ble on the racetrack, this city could suf-
fer severe environmental damage to its
landscape and waterways. Strip mining
pits ﬁnance against environmentalism,
with the former winning. Murphy
should end his support of this plan and
the planned track should move else-
where.

Outdoor reading room indicative of coming recession

The Bryant Park Open-Air Reading
Room is scheduled to re-open this month
in New York City. 1

The original reading room stood as
an illuminant innovation of the Great
Depression. But today, its presence
seems a frightening coincidence in the
dimming light of our nation’s faltering
economy.

According to an article published
last week in The New York Times, the
outdoor reading room was first opened
during the 1930s as part of a collabora-
tion between the Parks Department and
the New York public library, and was
intended to stimulate the minds of an
ever-growing unemployed population.

The comer of the park — framed by
weatherwom seats, book carts and gar-
den umbrellas -— served as a place
where people could spend their after-
noons under the maple trees, distracting
themselves between the pages of a
bound Joyce or Fitzgerald. The reading
room presented an alternative to the
monotony of the soup kitchen lines and
the day-to-day job hunt.

Now, the Bryant Park Open-Air
Reading Room will again offer to
engage New York’s temporarily idle, as

Cooperation, anticipate some-

well as those just taking their lunch
breaks. V .

But, as our nation’s economists
focus their fears on an imminent deﬂa-
tionary recession, could such a move
foreshadow a great downward
plunge towards 4 dare I say it
— a second Great
Depression?

Do today’s sponsors, the
New York Public Library and
the Bryant Park Restoration

thing that the rest of us only
conjecture?

Daniel Biederman, the
executive director of the
Restoration Cooperation, told
The Times that “the timing is coinciden-
tal,” but he went on to say that “in a bad
time, it’s nice to have a good book, and a
nice place to read it.”

Though it seems far-fetched to pre-
dict another economic collapse equal to
Black Tuesday, it is impossible to ignore
the current unemployment rate, the
decreasing value of the dollar and the
deﬂation associated ‘with what critics call
the White House’s weak dollar policy.

Furthermore, President Bush’s lat-

 

Christian Schoening
Contributing Editor

est tax cut could be the straw that sends
our economy to the breaking point,
rather than jump-starting our failing fis-
cal engine. 5
Tax cuts can boost consumer spend-
’ ing and ultimately lead to a
new, stronger-standing
economy. But, in today’s
economic environment, is
such a solutionviable?
' People simply are not
able to spend the,kind of
money they did ﬁve years
ago. In the last 12 months,
' the number of personal
bankruptcies has set a new
record, rising to 1.5 rnil—
- lion across the country.

N o matter how deep the tax cut, peo-
ple are ﬁnding themselves in debt, and
are less inclined to go out and be con-
sumers. _

In light of our role in the global eco-
nornic community, I also question the
White House’s stimulus plan. This is
where the weak dollar ﬁgures in. The
Times noted that, as of rnid-May, the dol-
lar hit an ‘all time low, in comparison
with the Euro, down’ more than 10 per-
cent. ~ g

A reduced-value dollar might stimu-
late U.S. trade export, but, according to
USA Today, this could discourage global
investors from considering U.S.
Treasury securities. As a result, the
United States will have a continually
limited monetary amount contributing to
our increasing deﬁcit. _~

Therefore, the reopening of the
Bryant Park Outdoor Reading Room
may not prophesy another great econom-
ic depression, nor, apparently, will it
serve the same purpose as its predeces-
sor.

Its resurrection, however, will serve
a new purpose, it seems: a distraction
and a place of solace for those caught up
in the storm of doomsday economic the-
ories. . .

Underneath the maple trees, those
with jobs’, without jobs, or those simply

in need of an afternoon off, will be able _

to divert their attention from the latest
financial predictions to the less-frighten-
ing world of a Steinbeck novel.

Martha Stewart trial should be kept from press to

America hopes to indict Martha
Stewart on charges of insider trading.
This isnot new information, as the
issue has been quite public since the
investigation began more than a year
ago.
Freedom of the press demands that
this information be made public, but
for Stewart, such publicity might be
unfair punishment. Given the value of
her reputation, it is possible that such
information should be private until she
has either been acquitted or convicted,

possibly years from now.

My familiarity with Martha
Stewart is limited to having purchased
her plates at K-Mart. Also, bowls and a
platter. They’re good plates and bowls,
and the platter is also good, as mea-
sured by their, ability to have food
products on or in them.

The quality of her products has not
been affected by the controversy sur-
rounding her sale of 4,000 shares of
stock in December 2001. People pur-
chase her products because they bear
her name. Now that her reputation is
not as pristine as her silverware, the
same people seem to have taken their
shopping dollars elsewhere.

Innocence until the proof of guilt
is a virtue of the American justice sys-
tem, not necessarily of the American
populace. V

Since reports of the alleged insider
trading, stock in Stewart’s company --

Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia —
fell from $19 per share, to an October
low of $5.47, according to a June 3
New York Times article. The same
article also noted that, on June 3, the
stock fell by a margin of $1.89 per
share. This drop came, consequently,
on the same day that her company
made public the expectation of an
impending criminal indict-
ment.

Clearly, Stewart has
taken a hit as a result of the
investigation.

Stewart ' sold 4,000
shares of stock in ImClone
Systems, at about $58 per
share. Allegedly, she did so
in order to preempt stock
losses resulting from the
announcement that Erbitux

My perspective of the American
ideal leads me to find Martha Stewart
—_ though not her kitchenware --
rather distasteful. But the same ideal
leads me to believe that the investiga-
tion has been inherently un-American,
merely because it has been public.

The nature of celebrity in America
is such that there would be a scandal. if
Stewart blew her nose on
her shirt. She has a partic-
ular image,‘ and failing to
live up to that image will
cost her dearly. I

It comes as no sur-
prise, then, that being infa-
mous for alleged insider
trading has._ had severe
financial repercussions for
her. _

rejected by the Food and Drug
Administration.

Assuming the extreme scenario
that, as a result of this announcement,
the stock would have fallen to a price
of $0, she stood to lose about
$232,000. Judging from the stock loss-
es her company has suffered, I imagine
she has lost more than that as a result
of the public investigation.

Serves her right — if she’s guilty.

But her guilt has not been deter-
mined, yet the punishment ensues.

mind, however, that she
hasn’t actually been proven guilty of
anything. Most Americans, I imagine,
would be more than capable of pre-
suming innocence in the jury box. It’s
expecting a lot, however, to ask us to
be objective on a daily basis.

In cases like this one, where objec-
tivity is the American way of doing
things, the American thing to do would
be to keep the investigation quiet.
Otherwise, Stewart is being effectively
punished before her guilt is certain.

At the same time, freedom of the
press, equally American and equally

ensure fairness

guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, is
essential to make sure our courts are
accountable to the public. .

These guaranteed rights, in this
case, seem to be at odds. It’s simply
not fair to say that the rights of the
individual supersede those of the pub-
lie or vice-versa.

Moreover, her crime was not a vio-
lent one, and while her alleged crime
may have hurt others, no one is in
immediate danger of losing life or

limb. She is not a menace of whom the

public needs to be aware.

For my money, defendants in cases
such as this should have the right to
decide. The absence of press coverage
at a trial may compromise the fairness
of the trial, but the victim, in this case,
would be Stewart. Moreover, as a
friend of mine suggested, the revela-
tion that Stewart had chosen a private
trial would convince consumers of her
guilt — even if Stewart were acquitted.

It seems clear, then, that Stewart,
and defendants in the same position,
should have the opportunity to decide
whether public defamation would be

worse than a judge with the gloves off. ,

Marty F laherty hopes Martha Stewart
is guilty. He’s wondering how she
could make a prison cell seem homey,
and if her silverware works well for
shank purposes. Reach him at

WEDNESDAY. JUNE 4, 2003. “Open the door, get on the ﬂoor; everybody walk the dinosaur: ” —— Was (Not Was), “Walk the Dinosaur”

Denver wasn’t the last dinosaur

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A & E Editor

Walk around Pittsburgh this sum-
mer and you’re sure to bump into a
prehistoric creature or two in your
travels.

Through early September, the
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
will install 100 unique, hand-decorat-
ed, fiberglass tyrannosaurs,
stegosaurs and torosaurs, crafted by
local artists and students, sponsored
by businesses and philanthropists,
throughout Pittsburgh. The first
round. of dinosaurs is being installed
this week.

The dinosaurs will “add a splash
of color and prehistoric panache to
our already diverse landscape,” said
Bill DeWa1t, director of the Carnegie
Museum of History. DinoMite Days
will also offer “a fun and exciting
opportunity‘ for anyone interested in
art, history, dinosaurs or the
Pittsburgh region,” DeWa1t said.
Judging from the first 12 of these pre-
historic works of art, this is certainly

the case. _
The first group of dinosaurs to be
installed around the city is as diverse
as the prehistoric creatures from the
Cretaceous and Jurassic periods,
ranging in subject and style from
Pittsburgh history and things of local
importance to the vastly creative.
Local artist Jennifer Urich
worked on a stegosaur, titled
“Untitled,” that reﬂects what might
now ’ ‘be considered prehistoric
Pittsburgh history. Coating the
dinosaur in a light—sensitive, gelatin-
based mixture and using a photo-
graphic process, Urich decorated her
dinosaur with black—and-white
images of abandoned steel mills,

including the Homestead Works and ~

Duquesne Works.

‘‘It’s kind of like dinosaurs on
dinosaurs,” Urich says. “I think [they
are] a key element to the history of
Pittsburgh and I wanted to capture

and document that before the evi—'

dence is gone.”
~ Rick Bach, a local artist from the
Art Institute of Pittsburgh, also

focused his attention on Pittsburgh’s
steel past, but to a very different
degree. His torosaur,
Crusher,” is a fiberglass dinosaur like
the others, but is encased in a large
steel shell, causing the torosaur’s tail
and horns to protrude sharply into the
air. ‘

As an artist familiar with steel
sculpting, Bach said, “It was just log-
ical for me, when I found out what
they were doing, to build a giant steel
one over top the [fiberglass dinosaur].
My original design was to cover it in
steel and have holes cut into it to see
pieces of the other one, but when I
got it, it just had so much volume and
roundness that I decided to build
something over it and open the mouth
real big. My goal was to make the
most f————d up one, and it is.”

While almost all the dino-artists
had three weeks to complete their
dinosaurs, Bach’s massive dinosaur
has been in production since February
and was completed only a day before
its May 15 unveiling. Thisvisually
catching piece is on display in

“Nino the

FreeMarkets Center, Downtown.

Not all the dinosaurs were crafted
by adult artists. One torosaur,
“Imagine Thatl,” was created by 14-
year-old Alexander Overby. He is the
youngest person to individually
design a dinosaur.

His torosaur includes many col-
ors, ranging from green, the color the
dinosaur’s skin might have been, to
fiery orange and red, to represent the
asteroid that likely wiped the mam-
moth reptiles off the face of the
Earth; Overby’s goal with his
dinosaur was to convey as’ much
information as possible about
dinosaurs, be it factual and scientific,
or feelings humans have for the
extinct beasts.

“I’m really proud of myself that I
made it,” Overby said of being the
youngest person with work included
in DinoMite Days. His idea for the
dino began as a two-dimensional
drawing of a dinosaur with ﬂames on

. it but, through “adding stuff to it as I

went along, like the stripes and the
greens and the different words that
come to mind when people think of
dinosaurs,” the idea was transformed

from a drawing to a three—dimension-

al object. “It was pretty tough,”
Overby admitted, “but it worked out.”

As if it weren’t enough of an "I

accomplishment to be the youngest

‘ person with work in DinoMite Days,

Overby’s" “Imagine Thatlf’ will be on
display in heavily trafficked
Downtown Pittsburgh. “I’m really

happy,” Overby said. “My friends and ,

my family will be real proud of me.”
. Other young people were
involved in the creation of DinoMite

A Days, though their contributions were

part of school-wide participation. -4
A City of Pittsburgh school,¢Phillips
Elementary, led by art teacher". Carl

Goldman, crafted a torosaur, titled’,

“A1phabetasaurus.”- It’s. decorated

with numerous letters and unique

variations of letters of the_alphabet.
'O’Hara Elementary _School also

has a dinosaur, a tyrannosaur called , A

“Elementarysaurus” designed" by
fifth-grader Madeline .. Docimo.

. “Elementarysaur_us” is covered in a.

jects students likely encounter in
their school days: math, science, lan-
guage arts, music, art and social stud-
ies are all represented on the

Luck be a lady tonight

lntacto ~

Starring Max von Sydow, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Eusbio

Poncela, Monica Lopez

A Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo

iﬁrfrfr e

;‘..F2lrn&‘.-y

Atziiié

In an age when thriller movies are domi-
nated by serial killers and criminals, it is
increasingly difficult to find a film that lives up
to the genre while carving its -own mark in it.

Enter “Intacto,” a ﬁlm about luck, who has
it and what those fortimate people do with it.

After surviving an airplane crash, Tomas

t (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is approached by two
people while recovering in the hospital. The
first, Sara (Monica Lopez), is a cop coming to
arrest" Tomas for robbing a bank; the other,
Federico (Eusbio Poncela), is. a man who

3 . claims Tomas is lucky and can use his gift of

luck to win his freedom, money and whatever
 else he desires.

What Federico doesn’t ‘tell Tomas is that
he, too, was once endowed with the same gift.
All of that changed, though, when his father
ﬁgure/boss, Sam (Max von Sydow), stole
Federico’s luck and kicked him out of
Uncanca, a mythic casino in a moonscape-like
desert, which serves as a sort of paradise for
the luck-endowed.

Now, Tomas and Federico gamble in

i games ranging from simple chance to perverse
contests that border on the ﬂesh trade — one’s
luck grows by winning photos of people in
these chance games because, we’re told, the
pictures steal a person’s luck — in order to

‘reach the ultimate goal: beating Sam, the king
of luck, in a reverse—style Russian roulette,
while avoiding the policewoman, who also
possesses the coveted gift of luck.

‘ “lntacto” is as original a thriller as you can

find in today’s cinema. Luck as something

you’re born with, while also a trait that can’ be .

accentuated or eliminated ‘by someone with
more of it_ than you, is a theme that’s intrigu-

ing. Director‘Juan Carlos Sbaraglia makes the
most out of it by crafting a taut thriller that
builds to an amazingly tense climax at Sa1n’s
casino. A .

The film is a slow starter, almost lulling
the audience into complacency with more ded-
ication to character development than story
and extended moments of beautiful cinematog-
raphy, but as the film unweaves its mythology
of luck, the pace and tension increase feverish-
ly. -
The acting from Sbaraglia, Lopez and
Poncela is as strong as the writing and direc-
tion. Von Sydow steals the show, despite func-
tioning as the ﬁlm’s tragic villain and being in
a more supporting role. He turns in another
commanding performance as Sam, the sullen,
aging casino owner and concentration camp
survivor. He’s sage-likewhile being brutally
calculating and callous. Von Sydow handles
the role brilliantly,.: and it’s hard to imagine
anyone else playing his part.

“lntacto” is a ﬁlm that’s been a long time

in coming for Pittsburgh audiences, but the
wait has been well worth it. It’s a thriller that is
entirely fresh, conjuring up reminders of direc-
tors like David Fincher, Carol Reed and
Stanley Kubrick without ripping them off. In.
his first film, Sbaraglia has given ﬁlm fans
something new and exciting in an all—too-often
stagnant genre. , ‘

“Intacto ” will be playing at The Oaks Theater
beginning June 6. The theater is located at310
Allegheny River Boulevard in Oakmont. For

“Marynell, Jeff and Karen bring a wealth of veter-

' . an experience to our staff, both on and off the court,”

Berenato said. “They will definitely help me to get the
resources we need to produce a viable product on and
off the court.” ’

Meadors,'who will work withthe guards and assist
‘with recruiting, began her coaching career at
Tennessee ‘Tech and coached there for 20 seasons

before moving on to Florida State, where she coached

-for l:0’year_s. _

OE MCA/POTS EDITOR

Brandon Miree and the Panthers look to dance around the competition this
season. Pitt football landed on two preseason top 25 polls.

“I look at this as a great opportunity to get the
women’s basketball program on the right track, and I
know that we are going to be able to accomplish that,”

S Meadors said. “I am really excited to bring Pittsburgh

to the top of the Big East Conference and I know, with
the great facilitiesand administration, we will be able
to bring in the top student—athletes.”'

In 1997, Meadors became the head coach and gen-
eral manager of the Charlotte Sting of the Women’s
National Basketball Association. After leading the

Sting to the playoffs in each of her three seasons,

Meadors became the director of scouting for the

Rematch of first World Seriesshould excite

In 1903, the ﬁrst World Series of base-
ball pitted the Boston Red Sox against the
Pittsburgh Pirates. This week, 100 years
later, interleague play has those two teams
playing a three-game series in Pittsbmgh.

Since the only other way the Red Sox,
an American League team, can play the

Pirates, a National League team, is in the ‘

World Series, it’s also the last time they’re
likely to play each other for about another
hundred years.

My allegiance to the Bucs makes sense;
I’m from Pittsburgh, I returned here for col-

. lege and I’ve considered it home more than

anywhere else I’ve lived. I I grew up in
Pittsburgh during the golden years of
‘Bonilla, Bonds, Van Slyke, Drabek and an
armual playotf exit, courtesy of the Atlanta
Braves. '

\ The Red Sox, on the other hand, ‘are a
team for which I can’t honestly justify my
fandom. I’m not ﬁom New England and
I’ve never even been to Boston. I have no
roots there, and this series is the ﬁrst time
I’ ve seen.the Sox play. Still, there is a strange
logic to being a fan of both teams.

I think I was ﬁrst attracted to the BoSox
because all of my teams love tragedy. Just as
the Pirates of my childhood had the toma-
hawk—chopping nemesis year after year,

‘ Boston has had the Yankees, the evil empire

of the baseball world. Both the Yanks and the
Braves are consistently among the richest
and best teams in their respective leagues,
gleaming and bland in their dominance.

The Pirates and the Sox, on the other
hand, are almost always underfunded and
‘composed of players who are before and

after their
_ primes.
The good
years are
al w a y s
surprises,
the bad
y e a r s
al W a y s
excused.

    

Spolrrs Vnrw the Phil

Greg Heller-LaBelle _

Mickelsons of the baseball world, playing
with nothing but heart and always coming

. up one break short of the shining boy won-

der.

Maybe because of that, both teams are
teams of potential. I know people who say
that potential is the kiss of death for any play-
er, because it only means you could be good
and aren’t.

Still, there’s a part of me that loves hop-
ing every game will be Jeremy Giambi’s
breakout game, that the next start will the
beginning of ﬁve consecutive dominant sea-
sons for Kris Benson. It’s not that I expect it
to happen, it’s that there’s always a seed of
hope. The Pirates’ seasons are like the Red

They’re .

Sox’ playotf chances — always just close
enough to success to disappoint when they
don’t quite touch it.

The martyrdom of Pittsburgh and
Boston fans is something that we wear as a
badge of courage. “Sure,” our frayed, black-
and-gold caps say, “it would be easier for me
to have pinstripes and a big New York logo
on ﬂiis hat, but I am a True Fan. I endure
your sighs of pity out of my boundless devo-
tion. My team may not always be good to
me, but I love them anyway and know that
somewhere, someday, they’ll change.”

Boston has now fallen a game and a half
out of ﬁrst place, and I’d like to believe the
Sox will overtake the Yankees. I’d also like
to believe that the Bucs, spurred on by
Reggie Sanders’ amazing turnaround, will
take the pennant from those stupid, chanting
fools in Atlanta. I. V

So, as I take ,a week off from work to go
to all three games at PNC Park, I’ll be able to
rejoice in every sttikeout, every comeback,
every blown save. Every play will be asign
of progress for one team, and there will
always be something to cheer for.

And even though the series will not end

in a rejuvenation of glory for either of my
history-burdened teams, there will be more
than enough hope for a lifetime.
