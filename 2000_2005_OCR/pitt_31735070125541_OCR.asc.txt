$2.28 million later, Pitt’s contract with Port Authority will continue

DAVE HARTMAN

News Editor

Nothing in life is free.

But when Port Authority Transit
votes on Friday to renew its contract
with Pitt, as it is expected to do, the
free bus rides that students, faculty
and staff currently enjoy will be pre-
served for another year.

The free ride allows beneficiaries
to travel on any PAT vehicle with just
the ﬂash of an ID card. That privilege
includes not only the authority’s

-more than 1,000 buses, but also more

than 50 light rail cars and two
inclines, and is paid for by Pitt’s $55
per student, per semester transporta-
tion fee, a cost that is the same for
both full- and part-time students.

And according to Pitt spokesman
Ron Cichowicz, that fee will stay the
same even though Pitt will shell out
an additional $380,000 this year to
continue the contract with PAT. The
20 percent increase to last year’s $1.9
million contract is reﬂective of PAT’s
company-wide 20 percent fare hike
last April.

But the increase is not reﬂective
of the amount PAT initially sought,
which would have taken both the
authority’s rate changes and recent
Pitt ridership figures into account.
PAT keeps track of the number of rid-
ers utilizing the free service so that it
can bill the University accordingly.
And by the authority’s calculations,

ridership is up.

The amount required to adjust for
both fare and ridership increases —
$2.52 million annually — will be

Oakland bank robb i

DAVE HARTMAN

News Editor

At 1:40 p.m. yesterday, a man
wearing latex gloves and a black
face mask walked into the National
City Bank on Fifth Avenue in
Oakland, approached numerous
tellers and, brandishing a gun,
demanded cash.

Neither the FBI, city police nor
National City Bank could specify
the amount of money that was
stolen.

The FBI has released a descrip-
tion of the robber, who entered the
bank alone.

No witnesses were able to veri-
fy the direction in which the man
ﬂed after leaving the bank.

He is described as a black man
in his 20s or 30s, between 6 feet

and 6 feet 3 inches tall, 150 pounds,
wearing a white or cream colored T-
shirt and faded blue jeans.

According to Jeff Killeen, an
FBI agent who is working on the
investigation, the robber repeatedly
threatened to shoot tellers if they
didn’t hurry up.

National City. Bank spokesman
Bill Idler verified that a robbery did
take place, but stressed that no one
was hurt, and that the bank would
open today at its usual hour.

Idler said National City is work-
ing with local authorities in order to
catch the suspect. _

The city robbery squad and the
FBI will continue a detailed investi-
gation into the heist.

Anyone with information about
the robbery ’ should contact city
police or the Pittsburgh branch of
the FBI at (412) 471-2000.

paid throughout the five-year con-
tract. This is provided annual renego-
tiations do not result in a new con-
tract, as was the case this year.

Pitt and PAT first offered unlimit-
ed free rides to University affiliates
in 1998, when a similar five—year
contract mandated that both institu-
tions renegotiate the contract annual-
ly, in order to account for unantici-
pated ridership changes. Since that
time, Grove said, Pitt ridership has
averaged nearly 450,000 rides per

month, a cost of approximately 35
cents per ride in the last fiscal year.

According to PAT spokesman
Bob Grove, the deal isn’t designed as
a money-making venture, but rather,
an investment in the future.

“We think the value in this is
exposing a large number of younger
people to public transportation,”
Grove said, adding that PAT is a non-
profit government-funded institution

Staff Writer

Pitt’s food services provider ‘has
ended its controversial ties to the busi-
ness of private prisons.

On May 30, Sodexho Alliance
armounced that it would sell all shares
of stock that the company owned in
Corrections Corporations of America, a
company that runs private prisons.

Sodexho A1liance‘Is also the parent
company of Sodexho ‘Marriott, the
company contracted to provide all of
Pitt’s food service.

“Sodexho was never involved in
[CCA]’s management,” said Sodexho
spokeswoman Leslie Aun. Aun said the

company had purchased the shares as a -

blind investment. .

Private prisons are those that are
owned and" operated by corporations
under government guidelines and
supervision. ‘

The company that owns the prison

is paid to house imnates. Critics of '

such prisons claim that the privatiza-
tion of jail cells creates an unfair con-
ﬂict of interest between the legal and
private sectors.

In a Pitt News story published ear-

lier this year, Students in Solidarity
member John Headley criticized
Sodexho’s practice as “students build-
ing prisons.” Headley and other
Students in Solidarity members gath-
ered more than 1,000 signatures on a
petition protesting Sodexho’s involve-

.ment with CCA.

In ending its ties with private pris-

- ons, Sodexho did not change the way it

provides food at Pitt.

But at the beginning of the fall
semester, the food service provider will
take over a popular food venue in the
William Pitt Union. . 0

WEDNESDAY, JULY 18, 2001

Pitt recently announced it would
close the snack shop on the lower level
of the Union within six weeks.

' The shop was run by the Student
Organization Resource Center.

A SORC representative refused to
comment on the shop’s closing.

The snack shop will be replaced by
another food vendor, dubbed Sub
Connection and run by Sodexho, that
will make prepared foods such as ‘subs
and pizzas. Depending on student
demand and use, the shop will be open
late at night for students returning from
clubs and parties.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill called
the shop “a wonderful opportunity to

create more responsive food services ‘

for the students.”

Hill’ said there were no plans to re-
open the snack shop, which sold sodas,
candy bars and magazines and provid-
ed picture developing services.

Hill said students could purchase
candy at local retailers and get pictures
developed at the photo store just down
the street. The Sub Connection will be
open in the fall.

The Sub Connection is the first
step of “Vision 2001,” a game plan cre-
ated by Frank Caru-so, the newly
appointed head of Pitt’s Sodexho oper-
ation. Part of . “Vision 2001” will
include adding more vegetarian dishes
to the menu and adding “sports bar
food, less the alcohol.”

“Eighteen to 24-year-olds prefer
‘comfort foods,”’ Caruso said over a
lunch-time meeting several weeks ago.
“Meat and potatoes, nothing too

' fancy.”

Caruso, who has worked in food
services for universities all along the

East Coast, also plans to incorporate 7

some of his own recipes, including one
for buttermilk pancakes, into dining
hall menus. '

CORRECTIONS

In the July 11 edition of The Pitt News, an article titled “Pitt to offer emergency
contraception in advance”- incorrectly identiﬁed the method by which emer-
gency contraceptive pills work. Pills prevent pregnancy by thickening the lin-
ing of a woman’s uterus so that eggs are not able to attach to the lining.

Also in that issue, the -editorial illustrator was incorrectly identiﬁed. Last
week’s editorial illustrator was Jon Fischer.

that derives only about half of its
revenue from bus fares.

Cichowicz applauded the renego-
tiation, citing the benefits that it
gives Pitt students and staff and
explained the lack! of an increase «to
Pitt’s transportation fee as the result
of good planning.

According to Cichowicz,‘ Pitt
engineered its transportation fee
three years ago in anticipation of ris-
ing PAT costs. Though that planning
will allow fees to stay the same this
year, Cichowicz advised that the sur-
plus could run out before the five-
year contract expires. He said only
time will tell whether increases
would come in the future.

WEDNESDAY, JULY 18, 2001

For now, the $55 per semester fee
covers Pitt’s agreement with PAT, as
well as services such as Van Call and
"the North and South Oakland shut-
tles, as well as the safety lighting
installed around campus. Both full-
and part-time students, as well as

'what Cichowicz called “fu1ly bene-
fited faculty,” can take advantage of
the free bus pass using student and
faculty IDs. Only temporary employ-
ees who don’t receive benefits from
the University are excluded from the
free ride.

Cichowicz said Pitt sees the con-
tract as a benefit to both students and
faculty who can more ‘easily access
the many attractions Pittsburgh has
to offer.

“The city is our campus,” he
said.

For fun, free‘ riding pleasure,
just get on the bus

On Friday, the Port Authority
Board of Directors is expected to
approve a new contract with the
University extending the free mass
transit service that Pitt students, facul-
ty and staff currently enjoy through
the 2005-06 school year.

The Pitt News applauds the
University and PAT for reaching this
agreement. The free-ride program is
not only a convenience for those who
take advantage of it, but it has also
helped alleviate parking and trafﬁc
problems in Oakland and throughout
the city.

PAT receives only roughly half of
its funding from rider fees —— the
other half comes from government
and private grants. To encourage
more people to ride mass transit, the
state and federal governments should
give PAT‘ more funding to make mass .
transit even more accessible.

No matter how cheap mass tran-
sit is, sometimes people still don’t like
to use it. But how you feel about rid-
ing the bus depends on the attitude
youtake about it. Admittedly, walking
to. stops can sometimes seem like a
hassle and the buses can be crowded.

But there are plenty of reasons to
enjoy mass transit.

To begin, buses are environmen-
tally friendly; a bus carries large num-
bers of people who are not driving
cars and thus not pumping pollution

into the atmosphere.

Bus riding also helps people
make better use of their time.‘ Rather
than having to stay focused on the
road, youcanread or study—or even
just think, daydream or nap on the
bus. Just don’t miss your stop.

Often, riding the bus is quicker

than - driving, especially from
Downtown to Oakland. It can also be
much less_ aggravating.

By riding the bus, you also get to
glimpse a unique slice of city life for
a few minutes. What better place
allows you to observe — and interact
with — people from all walls of life
and all sorts of different back-
grounds?

The contract renewal doesn’t just
beneﬁt Pitt students; it also beneﬁts
PAT. Every year, the University grad-
uatcs thousands of students, many of
whom will still work in the Pittsburgh
area. Having grown accustomed to
riding PAT‘, many may continue to
patronize mass transit systems in
other cities.

Additionally, employers can
receive tax deductions by purchasing
mass transit passes for their employ-
ees.

In the three years since Pitt made
its deal with PAI‘, other area schools,
including . Carnegie Mellon
University and West Virginia
University, have struck deals with
transit authorities. We should be
thankful that Pitt let us keep ours.

Making lemonade from summer

NORRISTOWN, Pa. — I’ve never been
that good at incorporating proverbial expressions
of the English language into/my speech. Only in

' . the context of conversation, normally with an

adult who tends to be over 40, do I actually hear
and understand the use of the aphorism.

I know the cliched sayings about leading a
horse to water and the shit hitting the fan, but
somehow vocalizing them feels like playing
dress—up when I was ﬁve, knowing that the high
heels don’t really ﬁt and that the makeup looks
really cheesy. In fact, the images that these say-
ings bring to mind don’t always comfortably
match my rendering of the way life goes.

_My mom’s friend told me today, ‘They give
you lemons, and you make lemonade.” Still
unclear of what my lemons are, I assume that
means I’m maldng the most of what I’ve got. But

'‘ lemons are sour and, thankfully, I

haven’t much reason to complain. MONICA
FAUST

, So I wondered how one would
consider lemons to be the metaphor
of my recent summer days at my
parents’ house, waitressing, taking a
long-dreaded surmner math class at community
college and replaying my memory’s footage of
six unique weeks in Brazil.

Each time I point out faces and struggle with
statue names in photos for a curious onlooker, the

I’ve been spending every chance I get at the com-

My need to grasp my count1y’s historic and

for a few hours each day.

like to consider a cross-section of America.

Single moms, college kids and oﬁice people
who work there on the side compose the domi-
nantly female wait staﬂ’. Young couples from
some of the wealthier suburbs of Philadelphia
head out to the King of Prussia Plaza to check out
Williams and Sonoma or the Baby Gap, and then
stop in for a $9 salad and milkshake.

VVith the combined effort of the mid-life cri-
sis managers, pinstriped servers and our all-
Mexican kitchen staff, we try our best to send
shoppers home happy.

What’s going on that makes so many young
Mexicans, male and female alike, come to work
here? What is the situation that compels them to
leave behind-their families and everything.they
know at such a young age? Does the fact that
shoes made in Mexico cost more there than they
do here have anything to do with
it? Probably, yes.

Napster is stealing  but-

what’s wrong with that?

About 14 months ago, I got caught
shoplifting.

It happened at Camelot Music in the
Westrnoreland Mall. I had been on a
kick of stealing CDs for the past year or
so, and I got a little too cocky. I had four
CDs in a small paper bag and I was tear-
ing the security tag off a ﬁfth one when
an employee came up to me.

I should’ve run out of the mall, but I
didn’t. I_was too intimidated. Mall secu-
rity took me back into their ofﬁce and I
had to ﬁll out forms. They
called my parents, even
though I was 20 years old at NAT
the time. It was humiliating.

They even wrote down SOLTESZ

the names of the CDs I was

trying to steal on the report. God knows
why I tried -to take the ones I did.
Electric Light Orchestra, Vitamin C and
The Venga Boys? It all seemed like a
good idea at the time.

But it’s over now. I paid a small fme,
and that was that. It’s probably on some-
body’s records, somewhere. Maybe it’ll
come back to haunt me in the future. I’ll
cross that bridge when I come to it.

These days I use more sophisticated
methods of thievery, like Napster and
other such Internet programs that allow
large groups of people to freely distrib-
ute songs and other forms of media.

Make no mistake —— if you’re down-
loading mp3s, you’re stealing, just in a
different form.

What’s the difference between
covertly taking a CD in a store and
anonymously downloading it on the
Internet? Just that there’s less people
watching you.

I prefer the program Gnucleus, now
that Napster sucks. You should try it, it
works really well.

The ease with which one can steal
media is sickening, but it’s only going to
get easier. But I don’t feel badly about
doing it. As far as my klepto guilt goes,
I feel worse that I stole from a small,
struggling CD store chain like Camelot
Music than I do about “sharing” files on
the Internet.

In a way, the mp3 revolution is vin-
dication, revenge against the corporate
advertising machine that has had free
rein to inﬂuence me since I was born.

I can’t help it that I want things. We
are all consumers. It’s just a fact of life
in this day and age. We define ourselves
to various extents by the things we buy,
the clothes we wear, the education we
purchase, the music to which we listen.

It’s not a totally bad thing. I wish
that capitalism didn’t exist. I wish that I
grew up in a lush jungle as part of a
tight—knit clan that would teach me to
live off the earth and respect my natural
resources.

 

Reality is what it is. And I like the
way I look in the clothes I buy, I enjoy
the music I now purchase at the CD
store. There’s no use getting too worked
up over the capitalist system that
oppresses us all.
Well, maybe there is. But it’s just so
huge that I can’t see how it could ever be
reversed. Marx tried, and look what hap-
pened. I’m sure it seemed like a good
idea at the time for him.
I can’t help thinking, though, of
what could have been:
human potential unburdened
by the barrage of ads and
~ corporate propaganda per-

petually thrown in people’s
. faces. People deﬁning their
relationships by something less shallow
than what clothes they wear or the music
to which they listen. No cars. Christ, I
hate cars.

Napster and its ilk have taken a cap-
italistic venture (the sale of music for
individual use) and turned it on itself.
Now one can simply download the
music they have been selling us all our
lives without having to pay for it. It’s a
beautiful thing.

It’s also a problematic thing.
Somebody loses out. Before it was the
consumer, now it is the artist. Artists
probably should get paid to do their
work. Art is important, and if the econo-
my doesn’t foster artistic growth the
whole industry could die.

It’s like all these lawsuits on the
tobacco industry. I suppose I should feel
equally vindicated that huge corpora-
tions that pushed their ‘product — and a
potentially deadly product at that — on
an unsuspecting public are now paying
their dues.

But I can’t help but wonder what
will happen to all the people who have
jobs in the tobacco industry. Weren’t
they just as unsuspecting as the people
who bought their product? Capitalism is
a two-way street, baby. If a brand sells
out, people are most definitely buying
in. Mass thievery and the destruction of
industries threaten the lives of real
working people.

I say, “so what?” Bring on the next
phase. If what I’_1l be listening to in my
next life is a bunch of nobody bands
playing just for fun, I’1l enjoy it for what
it’s worth. Free trade of media is here to
stay, whether people like it or not,

So bite the hand that force-feeds
you. Grab as much as you can before
they ﬁnd a way to make you pay for it.

Just don’t get caught. And if you do,
leave me out of it.

Nat Soltesz encourages readers to take

advantage of free media sharing before '

it’s too late.

Everybody’s been forced to do
something that they didn’t want to do

i at _least one time in their life: take out

the trash, walk the dog, rob a high-
security bank. It’s all good.
“Sexy Beast” is mar-
keted as a gangster ﬂick,
but the man-.caught-in-

_ _ Hitchcockian suspense. The undesir-

able situation appears in two forms: a

film opens with Gal Dove
‘ nd““”"hi's-»-‘porn ustar
wife, Deedee (Amanda Redman). Gal

 

  
  

has made quite a life for himself.
Retired from crime, he and Deedee
inhabit a villa in Costa del Sol, Spain.
While they are relaxing at home, out
of nowhere rolls a boulder that just
barely skirns him and then ruins his
pool. This catastrophic scene acts as a
metaphor for the entire movie; the
camera shot is the point of view of the
boulder as it rolls down the hill.

Cut to an airport.

A close-up of the back of a’ bald

belongs to Don, a former associate of
Gal’s, with far more destructive intent
to persuade Gal to do one more job.
If the film’s title refers to Don, the
word “beast” is an understatement.
He’s got battery acid ﬂowing through
his veins. He’s come to piss
on everyone’s. perfect

Gal’s bathroom ﬂoors.
Kingsley plays his
role as vile and psychotic as

“Final Fantasy’: The

Directed by Hironobu

BRLAN EASTON
The Pitt News V

“Final Fantasy: The Spirits
Within,” like “Tomb Raider” released
earlier this summer, shares its name
with a video game. But that’s where
the similarities stop. '

Unlike “Tomb Raider,” which
attempts to use real live-action people
to imitate characters in a computerized
game, “Final Fantasy” imitates real,
living people with computer-generated
images.

"With so many action blockbusters
using computerized and digital ‘editing
and effects, making a totally computer-

generated movie makes‘ sense.

The only question that remains is
if it succeeds in imitating ‘life? The
answer is a resounding, “kind a
of.”

There are ' times
throughout the movie
where one would be hard‘

-pressed to say that it was computer-
generated. Unfortunately, the opposite.
‘ is also true as there are times where it

Fantasy’s” unused potential.

The film’s plot involves a far—off
future where aliens have landed on
earth, launching what seems to be a
full—scale invasion. The aliens, called
Phantoms, are nearly invisible and
able to pass through solid objects.
Humanity has been reduced to cower-

way to combat the alien menace. What
follows is an action-scene-filled race
to save the world from both the
Phantoms and the military.

If‘ “Final Fantasy” is any indica-
tion, then look for great things to come
from the realm of computer animation.
Traditional actors have nothing to fear
from the likes of main character Aki
and her computerized thespians.

If anything, humans willbe needed
more than ever to furnish the voices
for these characters. One look at the
star-studded cast list, including Alec
Baldwin, Steve Buscemi andfMing-
Na, should prove that.

Computer graphics and hype aside,
in the end “Final Fantasy” is an enjoy-
able movie that is above par when it
comes to summer blockbusters.

Wright stuff

Poses

Rufus Wainwright
Dreamworks i Records

‘ktti

MELISSA BALICK
Staff Writer

Most musicians could not pull off
an album like Poses. It’s dramatic,
diverse, unusual and very sophisticated.
Rufus Wainwright, however, with his
rich, drawn-out vocals, skill with lyri-
cal wit and tendency toward vaudevil-
lian melodies, pulls it off seemingly
without effort.

Wainwright’s self-titled first
album, although a truly great work,
sometimes went a bit overboard, sound-
ing as though it was a soundtrack to a
Broadway play instead of a pop record,
or it lyrically tackled topics like the
Shakespearean character Desdemona
instead of something more familiar to
both the listener and the musician.

In Poses, he uses more modern
techniques sonically but still retains his
classical feel. And, thankfully, he cut
down on the melodramatics of the first
album by writing about young urban
men such as himself instead of literary
characters or myths.

Wainwright has grown up a great
deal between these two records. A case
could be made that he purposely tried
to avoid being too personal on the first
album by hiding behind fancy
metaphors. While he has not given up

any of his lyrical prowess for this
album, he brings the subject matter

down to earth sometimes, meaning  ’:
he’ll throw in a line about comparing; /

new brand-name sunglasses or arm
wrestling one’s own mother every so
often.

The best part of a Wainwright song
is its undeniably catchy yet unusual
melody. Every original song, on
Poses sounds possibly like
nothing else ever recorded
and definitely like nothing
else that has hit pop music in
the last few decades. Add to that
Wainwright’s unmistakable vocal style,
which takes center stage on every track,
and the listener can barely help but get »
completely drawn in. .

On this album, Wainwright has
chosen to include “One Man Guy,” a
song that has been a live favorite. for

   
  

some time. “Guy” was written by his

_.father,__folk singer Loudon Wainwright

Since his father’s style is so differ-
ent from his own, the track adds yet
another level of diversity to an album

that is already unusually diverse. For

instance, in the opening track,

“Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,” the

speaker wittily goes through a

A ' list of his vices. The song

I has a completely dif-

ferent mood than the

sober “Tower of

Learning,” and both

songs have a completely different
sound than the dark “Evil Angel.”

Poses shows that Wainwright will

be around _for a while, making interest-

ing and insightful albums for many»-

years to come.

Staff Writer

A few years ago, I happened upon a restaurant
whose house band was, unfortunately enough, a
Jimmy Buffett cover band. Comprised of a gaggle
of middle-aged Bible thumpers and their young,
impressionable Stepford-esque brood, the troupe
swayed together and sang off—key with a collec-
tive glazed look in their eyes.

Imagine the von Trapp family serenading
unsuspecting eaters with
“Cheeseburger in Paradise,” and
you’ll get the idea.

While this group had passable
musical skills, they didn’t mesh as a
collective, and the grating vocals made for an
unpleasant dining experience. I wished that I
could mute them out, but I wasn’t so lucky.

Thank goodness for stereos. Not only do they
have mute buttons, but eject buttons, as well.

More recently, I tried to like Deep Banana

more than a smattering of the Hammond organ.

of salsa and funk.

Unfortunately, the music never reaches that

MELISSA BALICK
Staff Writer

U.S. Maple makes me feel like I’m hav-
ing the wool pulled over my eyes. I desper-
ately want to understand and like them,
but with every listen, I become
more and more convinced that
there is nothing spectacular
about U.S. Maple or their fourth
album, Acre Thrills.

But enough about me. To imagine what
U.S. Maple sounds like, ﬁrst forget about
time signatures. Next, imagine that a giant
snake decided it wanted to sing in a band
Naturally, the snake wouldn’t be much for
lyrics. Lasﬂy, think what would happen if a
band only had only a very rough plan as to
how each song would go and thenlhad each
member allow each other memberto try to
pull the song into whatever direction he per-
sonally wanted it to go in.

The vocals are probably the least
appealing part of this band I cannot imagine

Maple has no regard for classical  » "T

Unlike the Shaggs, though, it is obvious 7
that the members of U.S. Maple are at least

listening and reacting to each other.
AmImissing.something?Imustbe, because
there are a: lot of people who love U.S.
Maple. Perhaps I just can’t open my
mind enough to enjoy music that
is so purposefully alien. But
then again, maybe musical
conventions exist for a reason,
the same reason human beings
don’t like the sound of nails on a chalkboard
is because’ certain sounds are naturally pleas-

ant and others naturally unpleasant

Acne Thrills is not all bad Certain
stretches within certain songs actually sound
good But then, suddenly, it will sound as
though one of the guitarists decided to pull
all of_his strings off the guitar or the drum-
mer thought it would be cool to throw a bar-
relfullofapples atthedrumset.

The band should get points for original-
ity and fearlessness, though..This is the type
ofbandlimaginegetsbooedoffalotof
stages, but they keep coming back for more.
Acre Thrills is their fourth album, after all.

So U.S. Maple, I take my hat olf to you,
but I reserve my right not to listen.

Revolution is packed with heart-
pounding, blood-churning energy.
‘Musically, Insolence puts forth the
ideal rap-rock album. The downside
to the band’s newest release is the

ambiguity of this revolting energy.
, At times the listener is left drowning

in a pool of negative and positive
emotions, not knowing which way to
swim for air.

Insolence, aka The I.N.S. Crew,
is set on creating a sound of their
own, and the band has made a very
respectable go at it. But even the

hyper—speed bandwagon
of rap—rock slows

~ genres of music are

paired together, the style
that is provoked can fluctuate only
so much. It’s when a band expands
on this combination that new sounds
begin to evolve. Insolence could
emerge as one of the forerunners of
that scene.

Sylvia Massy-Shivy, who is best
known for her work with Tool, pro-
duced Revolution. With appearances
by Rob Trujillo (Suicidal
Tendencies, Infectious Grooves),
Angelo Moore (Fishbone) and Sen
Dog (Cypress Hill), the supporting
crew is a tantalizing portion" of the
album. '

The album begins with a funky,“
and (highly synthesized, “Death

Threat.” The band then initiates a “

“Revolution” with references « to
Rastafarianism and instructs every-
one to stand up and “Get Up.” It is in
these three songs that ambiguity
runs rampant. ,

I_t is unclear who they are revolt-
ing against and why. But it is evident

I that their music is loud and exciting;

and regardless of Revolutionls mean
side, it is rather uplifting.

‘Lead singers Mech 1 and Mark
Herman provide the sound with a
raw edge. While Armando Cardenas
and Jerry Dalalo maintain the hip-
hop foundation on the drums and
turntables. Paul Perry (bass) and
Mike Rowan (guitar) supply some
occasional funk, but devote most of
their time to keeping this album dis-
tinctively hard.

Insolence’s previous albums
were under an independent and now
out-of-print label, which may
explain their limited impact on the
alternative scene. Up until

Maverick label, the band’s fan base

of academic work.

This year marks the fourth consecu-
tive year that the University increased its
highest number of honorees. Out of the
77 recipients, 35 have been Big East
Academic All-Stars in previous seasons

baseball and women’s basketball, while
a total of eight athletes made it from soft-
ball. Eleven men made the team from
swimming and diving, three from
women’s track and field. Women’se
swimming and diving led all teams with
20 honorees.

Harding, who was one of three hon-
orees from men’s track and ﬁeld, is a
native of Guyana, South Africa. He was
named to the All-Eastern‘ College
Athletic Championships team, finishing
fourth in the event.

Renick, who just ﬁnished her sopho-
more year, led the volleyball team in
kills and was named to the All—Big East
team. Gasti, Pepe and Bessolo made up
the softball team’s pitching staff last sea-
son. Gasti’s 2.45 ERA led the team.
Bessolo also sported an ERA well under
three and Pepe’s was at 3.04.

Grube was easily the top performer
in the pool this year. He ﬁnished in the
Top 50 in the NCAA Championships in

and five earned their fourth nomination.

Tim Montgomery of the men’s soc-
cer team, Katie Hunter and Amanda Lyle
of women’s swimming and diving,
Lindsay Carlson of women’s tennis and
Jennifer Nickels of volleyball are four-
time honorees.

“We are incredibly proud of these
outstanding student-athletes,” Pitt athlet-
ic director Steve Pederson said. “They

 

embody the unyielding commitment to
success that drives our daily efforts at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Some notables from the list of hon-
orees are Matt Irvin and Chris Papst
from the baseball team; Mike Grube and
Eric Limkemarm from men’s swimming;
Nikki Borza, Dana Jafarian and Jill

Nine athletes made the list from
each of the men’s and women’s soccer
teams. Three players made the list from

 

the 50-, 100- and 200-meter freestyle.
His teammate Limkemann was a Top 50
ﬁnisher in the 1,650 free. Emily Collie,
another honoree, also ﬁnished in the Top
50 in the 1,650 free, representing the

“We are very gratiﬁed that our rising
performances on the ﬁeld have been
matched by rising performances in the
classroom,” Pederson said.

Top 220 womenhoopsters attend Adidas camp

KENNETH PAUL

Sports Editor

Tennessee’s Pat Summit and approximately 300
other Division I women’s basketball coaches are
focused on the Fitzgerald Field House for the next
week as Adidas and the All-Star Girls Report are
putting on the Adidas Top Ten Girls’ All-American
Basketball Camp.

The invitation-only camp attracts the top 220
female scholastic players in the nation. Though only in
its second year it is already giving the Nike camp
strong competition with respect to recruitment.

Mike White of Monroeville, who is the president,

author and publisher of the All-Star Girls Report, got ‘

the camp started along with head scout Brett
McCormick.

“There were so many girls that weren’t getting
into the Nike camp, so we decided to start this camp,”
McCormick said.

McCormick is the scouting director for the camp
and he travels around the nation in search of the top

220 girls.

Lindsey Harding, who will be a senior at her high
school in Houston, is currently being recruited by
Duke, Colorado, North Carolina State and Kansas
State.

“I love the competition, these girls are the best and
I want to be the best, so you have to play har ,”
Harding said. “There are coaches out there that I deﬁ-
nitely want to impress.”

Rick Kabellis, a friend of White, is a high school ‘

coach from Chicago who also serves as a coachvduring
the camp. The 220,girls are split up into 16 teams that
share the names of current WNBA teams. Kabellis

coaches the Shock, a team that features Tyesha Fluker.‘

Fluker, who stands at 6 feet 4 inches tall, and
weighs 190 pounds, is one of more than 30 girls who
have already committed to a school. Fluker will go to
Tennessee after this season and is said by several
scouts to be the top low-post player in next year’s
class. ..

Fluker was not the only top recruit there.
McCormick said that Erlana Larking and Erika
Aniaran are also going to be impact players. Arriaran

Larking will be a sophomore.

Another soon-to-be sophomore, Sade Wiley-

“Last year I signed four kids from this camp and
we had a Top 25 recruiting class,” South Florida coach
Jose Fernandez said. “We’re looking to sign four more

Too many triumphs plagued by skepticism

In a week full of surprises,
celebrated accomplishments,
conspiraéies and shocking

deals, it is impossible to ignore
three issues to discuss only one. i
Therefore, in an unorthodox man-

8” ‘

   

net, I will go over three issues
occurring in three different sports:

baseball, NASCAR, and hockey.
I’m going to start with accom-

plishments and no one ﬁts this
category better then Cal Ripken
Jr. Not an All-Star? Oh con-
traire! I’d have to say that
thinking he isn’t an All-Star this

year or any other year is as
inconceivable as Ripken drinking sour

im. 11

 with players like

 

Game.

Cal proved his All-Star
status and much more, passing "on his

This year’s All-Star
Game was as perfect as
i could be. It brought inter-
national ﬂavor into the game
Ichiro
Suzuki, Chan Ho Park and all
the Japanese media taking over
the pressrooms. But it was
Ripken who was the big
star of the game by hitting
a home run off Park in the
third inning, on the ﬁrst
pitch of his ﬁnal All-Star

knowledge of the game to his proteges
Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter, who are
now following in Ripken’s footsteps as
powerful shortstops.

The second half of the season is a
time to celebrate what’s right in the game
of baseball. The celebration stopping the
All-Star game for Tony Gwynn and
Ripken was perfect. It is absolutely
astounding to see Ripken and Gwynn get
standing ovations at each and every ball-
park they play in. Keep up the good work
baseball fans and continue to show your

. appreciation for the last two heroes of the
a national pastime.

But any good feelings people may
have about Ripken or anyone else are

quickly replaced by conspiracy or drama.
Just two days before Ripken hit his third
inning All-Star Game home run, Dale

. Earnhardt*Jr. won at the Pepsi 400 on the I

same track that his father lost his life on
months before. Since Eamhardt’s win and
Ripken’s All-Star MVP, conspiracy theo-
ﬁes have proliferated claiming that these
two events were rigged.

PUH-LEASE! How conceivable is it
for six cars going about 180 MPH to all of
a sudden slow down simultaneously with-
out crashing and let the No. 8 Budweiser
car pass within the last few laps? Saying
that the restrictor plate on‘Earnhardt’s car
had bigger holes is garbage. Earnhardt
wo11ld have gone faster the entire race if
that was true. Besides, no driver in the
right frame of mind is going to want to
ﬁnish second and lose out on the
$100,000 difference between ﬁrst and
second place.

Now, do I really have to go into the
Ripken controversy? Yes, he won MVP at
the All-Star Game because ‘he was the
obvious choice in a game where few play-
ers had astonishing stats. I can guarantee
that Park didn’t lob the ball over the plate
for Ripken to smash. And, even if by some
minute possibility Park did lob the ball, it

just isn’t that easy to hit a home run. Come

on now, Ripken’s back up in the game.
Troy Glaus participated in the home rim
derby the day before the game and could-
n’t even hit one homer off a pitcher trying
to feed the ball over the heart of the -plate.

Conspiracies? All I have to say about
conspiracies is talk to the hand because
the face don’t wanna hear it.

Now to Pittsburgh’s own little issue.
This guy named Jaromir Jagr was traded
to that team called the Washington
Capitals. Sound kind of weird to anyone
else? Jagr —— Capitols. It just doesn’t mix.
Well it’s true, Jagr is a Capitol.

i Congratulations Capitols, you now have

the best player in the game. Yet, somehow
deep inside I have a gut feeling another
loss to the Pens in the playoffs is
inevitable this year.

’ The Caps/Pens rivalry seems one-
sided because for the last 10 years the
Pens have won every series. The’ Jagr
trade just put lighter ﬂuid on the Pens’ side
of the spectrum and should boost this
rivalry to an all-time high this year.

The Penguins have their worktcut out
for them as they try to replace a living
hockey legend. They must first sign
Kovalev and then pray that Milan Kraft
puts up the numbers that the Pens are hop-
ing for this season. By the way, a goalie
and some defense would be nice too. But
the Penguins played without J agr while he
was injured and they won, so why should
this year be any different?

Brian Goldman is a staﬁ’ writer for The

T Pitt News and is balled up in a corner of

his house near Washington, D.C., wishing
for the Capitals fans to JUST GO AWAY!

Gymnastics adds depth;more honorsfor Bryant]

KENNETH PAUL

‘Sports Editor

- .Pitt’s head gymnastics coach
Debbie Yohman announced the signing
of ﬁve recruits for the upcoming season.
The ﬁve additions to the Panther gym-
nastics team are Sarah Gibson, Alyson
Marquez, Kristen Marquez, Ashley
Petten and Leila Tait.

Gibson, who originally hails from

'Kent, England, brings eight years of

experience with her to Pitt." » Gibson
trained under Paula Gehman and John

Wotczuk at the North Stars Gymnastics-

Academy. During her tenure with the

North Stars, the all-around gymnast won V

state and regional awards.

“We’ve known-— Sarah for a long
time,” Yohman said. “We’ve watched her
struggle through many injuries and we’ve
seen her come back from those injuries.
She’s one of the most determined people
I know and her perseverance will
undoubtedly be a great asset to our team.”

Tait, who attended school at Pittsford
Sutherland in New Jersey, was .a three-
time county and section champion. Tait

‘ received all-county and all—league honors

this year for another top class.”
According to Ohio State assistant
Mike Kushkin, the game is becoming
more physical and quicker and now that
the girls can look forward to the
WNBA after their college career is

over. - ,
Sara Brown came all the way from

I Orange County, California. She will be

a junior this season and is already being
recruited by Duke, Ohio State, UCLA

and USC.

“AH the players are great. I’m real-
ly enjoying the experience,” Brown
said. “You got girls that are at the high-

est skill level and everyone steps it up. -

It’s hard but it’s‘fun because the camp is

‘ the best.”

Pitt head coach Tracy Waites was

also in attendance. She noted that it was

an advantage having the camp in her
own backyard. 1

“We definitely would -like to land
one or two recruits from this camp,”
Waites said.

“It’s great exposure for our campus
and for a whole week they can get a feel
for what we have to offer. There might
be kids that weren’t'initia1ly interested
in Pitt that might have a change of mind

_ after their arrival,” she said.

Twenty Adidas. Top Ten Camp
MVPs will be selected to play in the

Adidas Top‘Ten Camp All—Star game.‘

The game takes place Thursday night at

‘ 8 at the Field House. The camp rims

through Saturday.’

three years in a row and was named all-
state twice for her work on the balance

0 beam. She was the 2000 state vault chain-

pion and the 2000 Region Six balance
beam champion. '
“Leila had an out-

standing senior year in  
in Pill-
Sports

‘ Level 9 while‘ competing for Midwest

high school,” Yohman
said. “It was just one suc- ’
cess after another and we
plan on building on her
successes _ here at
Pittsburgh.”

The Marquez, twins come. to Pitt
from nearby North Catholic high school.
Both trained under Gary Stam at
Gymkhana Gymnastics of Pittsburgh and
were estate and regional "qualiﬁers for

Level 9 and 10 in the vault and ﬂoor exer-
cises.
“We are excited to have Alyson and
Kristen on board as a representation of
the local area,” Yohman
said. “We plan on using
the twins along with
Ashley Petten to add
depth to our squad on
special events.” ' _
Petten was a 2000
national qualiﬁer "for

Gymnastics in Ohio. She placed second
in the all-around and won the bars com-
petition at the regionals in 2000.‘

- Pitt wide receiver Antonio-Bryant

and defensive end Bryan Knight are con-
tinuing to add to their preseason acco-
lades.

Bryant was named a ﬁrst-team selec-
tion by Football News, while Knight was
a second-team pick. _

Bryant, a 2001 Heisman Trophy can-
didate, won the Biletnikoff° Award last
season, which is given to the nation’s top
receiver. '

Knight, who is on the Lombardi
Award watch list for the nation’s top line-
man or linebacker, recorded 11.5 sacks
last season. ' —

The team will try to improve on last
year’s 7-5 season, Sept. 1 when it opens
up the season against East Tennessee
State at its new home, Heinz Field.
