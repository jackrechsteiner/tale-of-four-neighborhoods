Student Government Board member Sandra
Telep sat straddling a‘ folding chair, with her bobbed
black wig askew, her hand clawing her upper thigh.
She threw back her head, arched her back and
moaned a deep, guttural sound. V

It was a far cry from the SGB meeting Monday
night, where Telep grinned and clapped like an
excited child when she was appointed the board’s

- newest member. This Sandra Telep, onstage at
Campus Women’s Organization’s Wednesday night 1
production of “The Vagina Monologues,” was a
dominatrix. \ " - 0

S Last year, 15 actresses performed “The,
Monologues” for one night in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom, a room that comfortably seats 150. By the -
start of that show, all of the seats were filled and
people stood with their backs against the walls. This

L year, the 34 actresses moved the show to the audito-

. rium in David Lawrence Hall, and nearly 400 people
turned out for the first of three performances.

Center stage was empty except for four micro-
phones. At the back and on the sides of the stage
stood 10 life-sized, red cardboard silhouettes of
women, each bearing the name of a woman from the,
Pittsburgh area who had been the victim of violence.

 After 87 years, Masonic Temple getsa newname

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

A historic Pittsburgh landmark
located on 200 feet of Fifth Avenue
received a new name yesterday._

During yesterday’s winter meet-
ing, the University’s Board‘ of
Trustees approved a resolution to

officially change the name of the‘

Masonic Temple to Alumni Hall. _At
the meeting, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg called the Masonic
Temple an “architectural and func-
tional treasure” and said that it was
.“a home away from home” for visit-
ing alumni.‘

In the resolution, the Board of
Trustees credited much of the
University’s overall success and

prestige with the “success and
accomplishments” of Pitt’s alumni. 1

Nordenberg said he knew’ that
Pitt needed a modified alumni cen-
ter, - but that he wanted to‘ avoid
locating it someplace isolated from
the rest of the campus. He said that
since the alumni association already
shared the building space with sev-
eral other groups such as. the Office
of Admissions and Financial Aid
and the Office of Governmental
Relations, it seemed right to further

recognize the former students,

rename the building and base it
around the alumni constituency.

William Roberts, treasurer of ‘
the Scottish Rite, a.Masonic Temple ’

in Ross Township, said that he has
not heard of any Masons who were

even "a little upset by the name
change.

“They could call it whatever
they wanted,” Roberts said. “It
probably will always be known [as
the Masonic Temple] in Masonic
circles.” _

Roberts said that hethought the
University would choose to rename
the building after someone for
endowment ‘purposes. .

Built separate from the
University , in 1914-1915, the
Masonie Temple originally served
as a community center for Masons,
a famous, but closed, brotherhood.
The. University purchased the

Masonic Temple in 1993, and in‘

1998, spent $16 million in renova-
tions. Following the precedent set

by the William Pitt Union in the
early ‘80s, the_Masonic Temple’ was

'not only altered to accommodate

University organizations and adapt
it to the future, but also to reclaim
the charm of the original building.
By 2000, the renovations were com-
plete.

The Masonic Temple still con-
tains the long halls, marble ﬂoors

and mirrored walls, but its also has

speedy elevators, an auditorium
capable of hosting plays and
screening ﬁlms in several formats
and classrooms with audio-visual
support. The Masonic Temple has
nine ﬂoors, boasts more than
100,000 square feet of "total floor
space and is the main location for
eight University organizations.

Pitt to offer first-ever System on a Chip class Tuesday

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

Pitt-will hold its first short class
on the innovative System on a Chip
at the ' Holiday Inn Select on
Tuesday. The course is held in con-
junction with the Pittsburgh Digital
Greenhouse, a nonprofit organiza-
tion that works with Pitt, Carnegie
Mellon University, Penn State and
several private technology busi-
nesses to spur economic growth in
Western Pennsylvania.

The SOC is “a touchstone cir-'

cuitry and the next generation in
integrative technology,” according
Greenhouse Vice
President of Education and Training
Dave Landis. The SOC can fit hun-
dreds of millions of transistors on a
single chip, drastically reducing the
size of various products that run off
circuits.

Pitt professor Thomas Cain and
Landis will teach the course. It is a
graduate level course advertised via
e—mail and open to professionals
looking to gain experience in the
burgeoning new field. «Enrollment

. was limited to 24, and, at “press

time, wasnearly filled.

The Digital Greenhouse was
launched in June 1999. The course
Tuesday will be the first of three
short SOC courses to be offered as
part of the project’s continuing edu-
cation program. Pitt begangoffering

an alternative master’s certificate in
SOC Design last fall.

Landis said Pitt was one of sev-
eral universities and private corpo-
rations to place a bid to teach the
course.

“The University has a large
stake in the [PDG]” said Cain, who
noted that Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg was the co—chairman of
PDG.

“We want the [PDG] to succeed
and hopefully provide a number of

_jobs to the community.”

The course will be divided into
three sections: an overview of the

entire program, a look at the
process used for designing SOCs
and a look at the present and pro-
jected markets for SOC.

“There will be a great focus on
getting your system, particularly
consumer products, to the market
quickly,” Cain said, noting that the
typical turnaround for a SOC prod-
uct from conception to final pro-
duction was 18 months. By compar-
ison, the Pentium 4 processor was
in development for 10 years.

“You must move quickly to be
competitive or you’ll lose market
shares,” Cain said.

Cain cited two case histories to
show how an effective use of SOC
can lead to huge business success.
One of the cases was the VisorVoice
Recorder System Module, which
was designed at Pitt as part of the
development of the three short
courses. The VisorVoice can store
up to two hours of a meeting or 120
individual messages that can then
be stored or uploaded on to a com-
puter for later playback.

PDG will offer two week—long
courses at Pitt in May that will
cover more in—depth design aspects
of the project.

tion of life in another kind of garment, the tent—like
covering that women in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan
were forced to wear. Actress Marsha Walsh read the
skit, and as she spoke, two ghost-like ﬁgures clad in
burquas climbed onto the stage and stood silently
beside her. - ,

‘‘Imagine you went mad, but
you did not know you were mad
because you had not seen the sun in '
years. You stopped trying to kill
yourself because it would be redun-
dant,” read Marsh. _

Other skits were more light-
hearted, drawing belly laughs and
claps from the audience even when
the subject matter was less than
pleasant. In “The Little Coochi
Snorcher That Could” La’Tash-a
Mayes related the tale of a woman
discovering‘ her love for another
woman after years of abuse at the
hands, of men. Mayes’ character
described her first sexual experi- -
ence with that woman, and the way she learned to
appreciate her “coochi snorcher,” a part of her body
that had, in the past, brought her /only pain.

“She transformed my sorry-ass coochi snorcher
and raised it into a kind of heaven,” she said.

One of the best-received skits was Shereena
Morrow’s “My Angry Vagina,” in which she
described her vagina’s feelings about sex, gyneco-
logical exams and tampons that she called “f—-ing

Temple’s new name honors alumni

A rose by any other name would
smell as sweet, and the same goes
for Pitt’s beloved Masonic Temple.

After school trustees voted to
change the building’s name to
“Alumni Hall,” Chancellor
Nordenberg explained the decision.
“It’s clearly a sign of our respect
and gratitude to our graduates,” he
said.

If a building is to be set aside in
honor of the alumni, the Masonic
Temple is a ﬂattering choice. With
the exception of the Cathedral of
Learning, no building on campus
carries such a commanding appeal.
The marble and brass-clad temple is
decked out with finery from floor to
ceiling in every room, and it comes
complete with accommodations fit
for a king, and of course, a presi-
dent

Aside from computer labs and
classrooms, the building is home to

the Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid, the Center for
Instructional Development and

Distance Education and, appropri-
ately, the Alumni Association. The
seventh floor ‘boasts an art exhibit
by Spanish artist Felix de la Concha
titled “One a Day: 365 Viewstof the
Cathedral of Learning.” It features
one portrait of the Cathedral for
each day of the year, and was
assembled over the course of two

years from 1997 to 1999. -

It is, entirely appropriate that
one of Pitt’s most beautiful build-
ings should be dedicated to the
roughly 200,000 Pitt alumni. It’s a
much—anticipated and welcome
change to see a_ building named in
honor of the graduates instead of
big money. Alumni Hall is a pleas-
ant alternative to “The Yahoo.com
Temple” or “Scrooge McDuck
Hall.” - ,

Pitt graduates don’t h_ave to
donate money to support their alma
mater and it now seems that the
administration actually believes
this.

In fact, a prosperous and pro-
ductive life after Pitt may do more
to support the University than a sin-
gle hefty donation. Gene Kelly
made the University proud, -not by
donating millions upon millions of
dollars, but by making great
movies. ,

Other Pitt grads do the same,
and this building is a tribute to-
them.

Only time will tell if the name
will catch on. For many students,
Posvar Hall will always be Forbes
Quad, and perhaps Alumni Hall will
always be the Masonic Temple. But
regardless of _what people call the
building, it’s big, beautiful, and
now it belongs to the people.

The hype of reactionary
  commentators

Our society, like any other, is sus-
ceptible to the occasional irrational
panic. Urban legends of peo-
ple drugged by strangers
who cut out their organs to
sell them on the illicit trans-
plant market. _

Yet no panic is more
irrational or fantastic than
the sort that is "created,
stoked and maintained over -
a long period of time by elite
opinion-makers and mass
media commentators. And

Columnist

At this point there is a statement of ‘

exasperation. “This time they’ve gone
too far!” “What will the
P.C. police think of next?”

now have become tenured

of these, none is more spe- - -

non of “political correctness” at U.S.
universities.

An incalculable number of column-
inches in U.S. newspapers large and
small have been devoted to the subject
of “RC.” over the past 10 years. By the
looks .of the most recent output, it
appears thatthe leading pundits of the
right have developed a computer pro-
gram that allows them to randomly gen-
erate a standard denunciation of the
specters of _ subversive and “anti-
Western” tendencies in U.S. universi-
ties. _ ' ~ I

Such columns inevitably begin with
a standard byline —— like George -Will
and William Safire. They proceed to an

anecdotal story about a supposed cam- ,

pus P.C. horror — the student who got
in trouble for calling‘ some other stu-

The column then wraps up with an
ominous speculation about the implica-
tions for the culture — students will

know more about Frantz Fanon than

George Washington, “relativism” will
replace “objective truth” and so on. As
anyone who has spent more than ﬁve
minutes on a university campus knows,
there’s a major ﬂaw with this line of
analysis: It bears no relation to reality.

In reality, universities are not run by
the left, but are bulwarks of the status
quo. Our own University, for instance,
has a board of trustees staffed mostly by
corporate executives and by politicians
like Dick Thomburgh, who crushed the
now-defunct state student association
when he was governor and went on to
become U.S. Attorney General under
Bush the Elder. V ’

Our administrators angle for corpo-
rate dollars andtherefore attempt to run
the University on principles congenial
to corporations, e.g., deliberate efforts

THE PITT NEWS

Milosevic must be punished for his crimes

During most of the 1990s, Slobodan
“Milosevic stood addressing thousands of
cheering supporters as president of the
Republic of Serbia and later of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. A
Now he stands addressing an intema-
tional criminal tribunal as a defendant
His fall from glory was swift. In
October 2000, he lost a presidential election.

Although he tried to invalidate the results, a.

popular revolt forced him from ofﬁce. On
June 28 of last year, the new government
extradited him to The Hague, Netherlands,
to face trial before the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

This week, Milosevic became the ﬁrst
former head of state to face trial for crimes
committed while in oﬂice. Only one other
leader, Gen. _Augusto Pinochet of Chile, has
even faced the risk of this fate. »

If convicted of such charges as crimes
against humanity and genocide, a man who
was once one of the more recognizable
world leaders could spend the rest of his life
in prison.

Critics charge that his trial before the
tribunal is imperfect justice. As Bill Keller
of The New York Times noted in his Feb. 9
column, many allege this is thejustice of the
victors.

The critics are right. NATO defeated
Milosevic in a bombing campaign in

Kosovo in 1999. The indictment came_

down at that time. So it is the justice of the
victors, which is always imperfect
But it is better than no justice at all.
Throughout the 1990s, this man

allegedly spearheaded one of the largest’

, campaigns of genocide in recent memory.
The ethnic wars in Croatia, Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Kosovo left scars that may
never heal. ‘Thousands lost their lives, many
in massacres. Europe had not seen carriage
of this scale since World War II.’ , »

After that war, the victors “tried the
defeated, executing many of _ them. The
world reached a consensus that certain
crimes were so horrible that no one —
whether acting in an oﬂicial capacity or not

.—- should ever be allowed to get away with
them. The Nuremberg trials were intended
to show the world that these crimes should
never happen again. '

But they have. They’ve happened all
around the world. In 1994 in Rwanda, for
example, about 800,000 people were killed.
Thanldully, an international tribunal exists
in Tanzania to deal with this.

Someone needs to answer for what
happened in the Balkans. The culpability for

_tl1e crimes leads all the way up the ladder to
Milosevic himself. So it stands to reason

- that he should face trial for this. His leader-
ship was what caused these things to hap-
pen.

Milosevic’s trial should set an example
for leaders around the world that the inter-
national community will not tolerate geno-
cide and crimes against humanity. It shows
that no one should be unaccountable for his
or her actions as leader of a country.

A Jean—Claude

Or at least it’s a good ﬁrst step in that dered is the poorest in the Western

direction.

Obviously many other
leaders have gotten away with
quite a bit. Pinochet, during
whose dictatorship at least
3,197 people were killed or dis-
appeared, was arrested in '
London in 1998, only to be

released because of health prob- _ H  »

In many other countries,
the perpetrators of great

or even running the country.

now have the fear of being dragged in front
of an intemational court to face intemation-
al justice.

This trial could lead to greater scrutiny
of other leaders’ actions. It will open a
Pandora’s box.

And it’s about damn time that this box
opens. If Milosevic’s trial prevents even one
world leader from committing one atrocity,
it will be worth it '

Columnist David McKenzie hopes that
Henry Kissinger is next to face a trial for his
actions while in oﬁice, specifically placing
Pinochet in power in Chile. He can be

THE PITT NEWS

Leftists don’t run American universities

to attract a more affluent clientele in the
form of "more and more well-to-do stu-
dents, and a hostile anti—union labor pol-
icy that seeks to keep wages as low as
possible and to outsource work to out-
side ‘ﬁrms where feasible. By and large,
our administrators hobnob with corpo-
rate ﬁgures on a regular basis, go to the
same parties and play on the same golf
courses. They are of the corporate
world.

Our most ' high-proﬁle Vice
Chancellor, Jerome Cochran, opposes
the collection of statistics to determine
whether the Pitt police engage in racial

proﬁling. There’s no need to do so since
the Pitt - police don’t engage in racial
proﬁling. How do we know this?
Because Jerry Cochran says so. '

It’s true that the occasional radical
can be found on the faculty of a number

.of university departments on this carn-

pus and on many others. Though con-
trary to myth, most ‘60s radicals either
got more conventional occupations or
found jobs in “movement” institutions
like community ,organizations, civil
rights and other nonproﬁt groups,’ and
labor unions. Yet they draw the ire of
political commentators, not because of
their dominance, but because of their
visible‘ marginality.

The left has been driven from near-
ly every opinion-fonning institution in

l the country from radio to newspapers to

television.

' The exceptions prove the rule:
Michael Moore’s “TV Nation,” for
example, was popular as a pilot on both
Fox and ABC, but never made it as a
regular show. Moore was later relegated
to the more marginal Bravo network. A
few radical professors hang on in the
universities, but their presence hardly
interferes with the agenda of those who
really run the academy.

V regard to the hemp protests,

 

Hemp foods do not
contain THC

I’_d like to respond to a
recent article on the subject
“What happened to all the real
protesters.” First, perhaps the
author should take a break
from making fun of the protest-
ers and try actually listening to
why they’re protesting. With

hemp foods do NOT contain
THC. In fact, hemp is a differ-
entpart of the marijuana plant
altogether and contains an
agent in it that counteracts the
effects of THC. The reason the
illegalization of hemp foods
makes people so angry is not
that they now can’t buy foods
with marijuana in them (they
couldn’t do that before), but
that hemp foods and products
4 are an environmentally friendly
and healthy alternative to typi-
cal manufactured,“ chemical-
infused’ products. Eating a
hemp granola bar will not give
you a high no matter how
funny a column it might make
to assume it would. Illegalizing
hemp is like illegalizing wheat.

Tuesday morning brought with it
the armouncement of the 74th annual
Oscarnominations, and with it, conﬁr-
mation for many critics — this one,‘
included — that all conventions of taste
have suddenly‘ gone out of fashion.

Through the year, my interest in
ﬁlm has suddenly skyrocketed; during
November and December, a barrage of
ﬁlms that set my heart ‘a-ﬂutter hit the
theaters. Never in my life have I felt
more compelled ‘to go see movies on
opening day  and lots of them, too.

Pourquoi? if

Les|ie.Hotiman

 

I didn’t waste my time on ﬁlms
that I didn’t think weren’t worthwhile, either.

Granted, I could never be a successful film critic; I only see '

what I deem worthy of my presence. I stuck to the ﬁlms I felt

sure would leave a lasting impact on cinema forever.
Apparently my judgment is not on par with the Academy’s.
I forsook “A Beautiful Mind” and “Ali” — nominated for

eight and two Oscars, respectively — for the darker themes of

“The Man Who Wasn’t There” and “The Royal Tenenbaums,”_

which carried one nomination apiece. I shied away from the
ﬁlms that screamed, “I am an Oscar-winning machine that will
carefully manipulate your emotions so you feel what we want
you to with a happy ending” and instead saw the ﬁlms that were

subtle, tasteful and unique, ﬁlms that I thought truly bettered the ,

art

then I must have missed something in “Bridget Jones’s Diary”
— somehow Renee Zellweger’s leopard panties must be more
tasteful and “real” than Gwenyth Paltrow’s Lacoste dresses,
black eyeliner and sense of loneliness in “The Royal
Tenenbaums.” I suppose they did both play characters who just
want to be loved.

But the Academy doesn’t judge ﬁlms this way; the people

in the industry who create the ﬁlms vote for the Oscar winners, -
not small, erudite audiences with a proclivity for quirkiness and

originality. _ »

This shouldn’t surprise me, though. This is what the media
does. It’s a vast, endless, self-congratulatory consuming god that
manipulatesthe public as much as they allow it. Television,
Hollywood, magazines of all shapes, sizes and genres, indie
zines, radio, themusic industry, newspapers ——_ even The Pitt
News —— comprise this never-ending ﬂow of ‘information in
ﬂux. ' 1

While some media sources attempt to seek the truth, for the
most part, intelligence, goodness and purity don’t matter to the
media as a whole. This machine builds up and tears down what-

ever and whomeverit wants",/,largely in the interest of making.

That’s why blockbusters {such as “Lord of the ,_,Rings”

received 13 Oscar nominations, and “A*Beautiful Mind,”. ‘=‘Ali” I

And while I can perhaps criticize women’s“magazines' for
their unrealistic portrayal of women, television news for its sen-

Sciences for its Oscar nominations, there’s not much I — or you

Staff Writer ‘

If when twilight crawls into the city tonight and
you ﬁnd yourself in the mood to take off the gloves for

some bare-knuckle, no-holds-barred American rock

‘n’ roll, thengthumb on down to the South Side’s

5Brewhouse. Local-hard-rockers Modey Lemon will be
celebrating the release of their new self-titled CD ~

(released by A—F Records) by headlining a show that
includesguests Lord Grunge, The Human Brains and
Crucial Unit. If you’re sick of listening to top 40 radio
garbage, a good stiff shot of Modey Lemon (chasers
are for sissies) may be just the thing that you need.
Their ﬁst-pumping sound cuts straight to the bone —
as if Mr. Modern Rock himself came up and kicked
you squarein the t¢e.th with. lll§‘big.b4d.§i%§.12S-,". , .

 _ names; .'

Modey Lemon doesn’t fool around; these boys are-
sick of the pop rock and MTV music scenes,‘ and they
make no bones about playing their hard rock tunes.
with all the energy that they can muster up. Born and '
bred on ‘70s classic rock, Modey Lemon describe ~
themselves as being inﬂuenced by “the violence and
turbulence of bands like The Who or The Stooges, and
the weird darkness ofThe Doors or Black Sabbath.”

Fusing that with pure rock ‘n’ roll energy is no
small feat for the Pittsburgh-based duo, but th‘eir"musi—
cal depth (Phil Boyd — guitar, vocals, moog synthe-
sizer + Paul Quattrone ——- drums harmonica) helps
them to roll up their sleeves and get the job done.

Songs like “Big Bang” and “Recycler” are hard-
rock battle cries, with a touch of punk thrown in the
melee, while “Cofﬁn Talk” and “Jesus Christ” demon-
strate the darker, broodier side of the band. No matter
which tracks the band showcases, their heavy distorted
guitar and primal drum beats will be sure to shake the
foundations and rattle the pipes. And, no covers will be
heard here — Modey Lemon only comes in one ﬂa-
vor: 100 percent pure, complete with little bits of citrus
pulp to grit your teeth on. , I

Ifyou’re feeling up to the challenge tonight, put on _
your studded leather and roll on down to the South

Back to the table. The little girl asks Phat Man Dee to
perform at her ninth birthday party, and Phat Man Dee con-
curs with gratitude.

“I would love to play at your birthday party. Just call me
a little closer to the big day.”

Phat Man Dee pulls a small red notepad out of her
pocket. She jots down her number and chuckles. Not too
many kids will be coming to that party ——. for fear of their
entertainer.

But Phat Man Dee doesn’t need any reassuring.
Originally Mandy Kivowitz, Phat Man Dee was born an
entertainer. She sings in seven diiferent languages and plays
eight diiferent instruments. She does a variety of perfor-
mances, but specializes in jazz.

“The beauty of jazz is that you can put your own mark
on it,” Phat Man Dee says. VVrth her noticeable eccentrici-
ties, this certainly isn’t a problem for her. She continues,
“Jazz isn’t a what. No one can tell you what jazz was or is.
It’s not what you’re doing it’s how you’re doing it.”

Some of her other performances include eating light
bulbs, belly dancing with her boa constrictor, Cat A.
Strophic, and doing strip shows for bachelor and fraternity
parties.

“I don’t do any penetration. I strip off a clown suit . .. I

Bruiser

George Romero premiere
Tomorrow, 8 p.m.
Masonic Temple

George Romero, a master of cinematic
horror and a legend in the ﬁlm industry
thanks to his groundbreaking ‘Night of the
Living Dead,” will premiere the 35mm ver-
sion of his latest work, “Bruiser,” at the
Masonic Templetonight at 8 p.m.

Romero is an oddity in the ﬁlm world.
Once a Pittsburgher achieves fame, he bolts
for New York or Los Angeles -—- Michael
Keaton and Jeff Goldblum are good exarn-
ples of this. But Romero, like his frequent
collaborator and horror makeup icon Tom
Savini, lived here before achieving fame and
notoriety and still takes up residence in
Pittsburgh.

Originally from New York, Romero
came here to attend Carnegie Mellon
University. He is not a born and bred
Pittsburgher, but, as is our custom, we claim

him as our own. And why shouldn’t we? By
staying here despite his success, he shows
love and respect for the city that helped build
up his name.‘ ‘

Pittsburgh’s inﬂuence on Romero and .

his work is very evident. “Night of the
Living Dead,” “Dawn of the Dead” and
“Creepshow” are three of his biggest works
and, coincidentally, were all ﬁhned in
Pittsburgh or in its surrounding areas.

While Pittsburgh has played host to
many major ﬁlm productions in recent
years, such as “Silence of the Lambs,”
“Wonder Boys” and the recent “The
Mothman Prophecies,” the local ﬁlm indus-
try was severely hurt by the ﬂow of ﬁlm-
makers to Canada, where it’s less expensive
to ﬁlm. '

For example, Romero’s latest ﬁlm,
“Bruiser,” was ﬁlmed in Ontario instead of
his own backyard and released as a direct-
to-video product in 2000. In spite of these
circumstances, he still thought Pittsburghers
are worthy of being the ﬁrst to see his latest
masterwork the way it was originally
intended to be seen.

Getcheap at Dance
Alloy this weekend

Big Brother hovers over the dancers, his
voice resonating from above, his presence
ﬁngering as though he is really there.

In this case, Big Brother is Mark Taylor,
artistic director for Dance Alloy’s “New
Directions: Dance d Video,’-’ which
runs through tomorrow. It is an inter-
active performance examining ~
perspectives of reality. 

In the ﬁrst segment of the &
program, “What if: ~ "
Translations,” Taylor plays ‘ 
with what is preserved by video and
what is happening live. The large

overhead projection of him directing the j _

dancers is accompanied by a pre—recorded
video of a very similar performance wiﬂr the
s_ame dancers. This piece provokes question
as to what’s really happening and what’s not

Pat Hart, public relations director of
Dance Alloy, explains that Taylor’s motiva-
tion for the piece came from an exhibit of a
tilted room at Carnegie Mellon University’s
“What’s On” festival, which introduced a

   
  

“skewed perspective.” '
“We’re trying to get the audience more
involved in the dance experience,” Hart

' explained. “This piece is very involving.”

In this performance, the audience focus-
es on more than just a single image and
ﬁghts the battle between the performers and
the “larger thanlife video character,”_ Hart
notes.

Three other segments of the program

V deal with subjects such as confusion of
movement and time as well ‘as the
exploration of the dignity of
life as it’s set against the natural
world. I
» . As a prelude to the perfor-
 mances, excerpts from “Full
' iMoon” will be shown. “Full
Moon” is a computer-animated piece by
Pittsburgh Center of the Arts 2001 Artist of
the Year, Paul Glabicki, who has taught art at
Pitt for 25 years. It incorporates forces and
relationships between objects, images, expe-
riences, space and time. ’

“New Directions: Dance and Video” is the
second of this seasons SH0Wm0m__ Series;
The pmgram begins at 8 p.m and admission
is $12. _ ‘ ' L

Hey Pens fans:
no reason to
boo Lemieux

 

Spears Vrzw
Shaun Griffin

People, I’m a Philly fan and conse-
quently an expert in the art of booing. Just
ask Kobe Bryant how seriously Philly fans
take their craft.

Now that I’ve presented my creden-
tials from the famous Boo-Bird Academy,
let me send a big boo out to any and all
Penguins fans who have been bad-
mouthing Mario Lemieux for making the
Olympics his top priority.

It’s not like you haven’t heard this
from a Flyers fan before, but what’s wrong
with you people?

Through the years, Mario has given
you everything. He is the only reason you
still have a team to complain about.
Otherwise, the Penguins would be slump-
ing in Portland right now.

And yet you fault him, because he
wants to spread the wealth to his fellow
Canadians and bring them home a gold
medal. What’s wrong with showing a little
patriotism even if it isn’t for the United
States?

Yes, he’s missed some games, and the
team is in danger of missing the playoffs
for the ﬁrst time in over a decade.

But at least Mario’s honest about it.
He doesn’t make excuses, unlike so many
NBA all-stars this weekend who sat out of
the game with various toe injuries (Vince
Carter was the leading vote—getter from the
fans, and he didn’t even have the decency
to show up).

Mario said the Olympics were No. 1

. and he also said that he would probably

play every game for the rest of the year for
the Pens, so hold him to his word.

The Pens aren’t out of it yet, and I
think everyone will be singing a different
time if and when Mario wins gold and
takes the team to the playoffs.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORT S NEWS

Big East clash in Morgantown

MATT WEIN . . ’

Staff Writer

It’s time to talk about numbers. Fourteen is the number of the
Panthers’ latest national ranking, four is the number of regular sea-
son games remaining and two is the number of times that the
Panthers (21-4 overall, 9-3 in the Big East) still have to play-West
Virginia

The ﬁrst of the two bouts will_take place tomorrow as the

Mountaineers (8-15, 1-10) host the Panthers in a game that will be _

nationally televised on ESPN.

Pitt enters this match having won six of its last seven games.
Pitt’s last win, a big win over Syracuse on the road, is considered by
many to be the team’s most impressive performance of the season.

Pitt’s recent brilliance has all but guaranteed it a berth in
March’s NCAA Championship Tournament and the team looks to
sustain its on-court success in hope of securing a ﬁrst round bye in
the Big East Tournament, which is to be held in New Yorkin early
March.

The Panthers’ conference play this year has been very good, as’
they have already swept three Big East rivals (Georgetown, Boston
College and Syracuse) this season. Should the Panthers go unde-
feated in their ﬁnal four games, they will have swept a total of six
Big East opponents over the season. . -

The Mountaineers, whose 2001-02 campaign thus far has been
nothing short of a disappointment, will look to play the role of spoil-
er to Pitt’s late-season aspirations. West V1rginia’s one Big East win
in 11 attempts is a conference worst this season.

Senior forward Chris Moss leads WVU. Moss is the team’s
leading scorer (18 points per game), rebounder (8.2 boards per
game) and shot blocker (21 blocks on the season).

Freshman guard Jonathan Hargetfs play has been another
bright spot for the struggling Mountaineers. Hargett averages 13.4
points per game and shoots a phenomenal 90 percent ﬁom the free-
throw line. ,

Senior guard Lionel Armstead is an additional scoring threat,
averaging 10.7 points per game. He has also been very successful

Panthers ride momentum into meet

 

 

KEITH PARADISE
The Pitt News .

The men’s basketball team isn’t the
only team on campus that’s getting better
as the season rolls along.

Two weeks ago, the Pitt women’s
gymnastics team upset a nationally ranked
Auburn team at the Cat Classic at the
University of Missouri. Last weekend, the
Panthers recorded a season-high team
score of 194.35 as they blew away the sec-
ond closest competitor, Rutgers, by more
than two points.

This weekend, they hope to continue
to build momentum and conﬁdence as
they take on Central Michigan and
Ursinus College at the Fitzgerald Field
House Saturday at 7 p.m.

While the Panthers (5-5 overall, 1-2

East Atlantic Gymnastics League) either
tied or topped tearn-high scores in all four

* events, they continue to strive for

improvement. Head coach Debbie
Yohman said that the team has been prac-
ticing relentlessly this week on their bal-
ance beam and vault routines. .

On the vault, they have been working

on increasing the complexity of their rou-.

tines. The team doesn’t want Saturday’s
score of 48.75 to be the tip of the iceberg.

“We scored a team high on vault,”
Yohman said, “but [the team] wants to go
for more.” V .

-That philosophy may be important on
Saturday. ' . .

Central .Michigan (4-6, 3-3 Mid-
American Conference) comes to town
after having posted its second highest
score of the season in a 193.25 to 190.675

victory overj-e MAC rival Western
Michigan. The team also posted season-
high scores on the ﬂoor exercise‘ (49.1)
and vault (48.55) routines.

The Chippewas also bring with them
the MAC “Gymnast of the Week,” Kara
Reighard. The freshman received the
honor for the second time/this season after
a season-high 9.825 on the uneven paral-
lel bars propelled her into ﬁrst place for
all-around points with a total of 38.6.

“_She’s a real good gymnast,” Yohman
said. “She was really good when she was
in high school.” ‘

Reighard was not highly recruited by «

many schools since it was assumed that
she would be attending Central Michigan
where her father, Jerry Reighard, is the

Snowboarding club takes on competitive edge

‘ COURTESY OF JOE BERGER

Pitt’s Erin Hoban placedfirst in the Women’s divi-
sion at the snowboarding competition held at Penn
State on Jan. 19. ’

 

RALPH MASTROMONACO
The Pitt News

Snowboarding is no longer just a pastime for Pitt stu-
dents. The Pittsburgh Intercollegiate Snowboard Team has
brought competitive snowboarding to the University.

Tom Miaskiewicz, Geoff Stilley and Brandon Shaffer
founded PIST in 1999 after strong dissatisfaction with the
Pitt Ski and Snowboard Club’s limited variety in resort
selection.iThe trio wanted a bigger challenge than Seven
Springs, the prominent local resort

PIST is a twofold operation — a club for snowboard-

, ers of all skill levels and an eight rider competitive team.

The riders from Penn State and WestV1rginia are PIST’s
main competition. The team traveled to Tussey Mountain,
a resort close to Penn State, for their main competition of
the year. PIST also tries to hold a competition every year at
SnoZone, a board-park in Finleyville, Pa. This year’s com-
petition was canceled due to inclement weather.

_ The team is made of the club’s eight best riders, usu-
ally consisting of six men and two women. Tryouts are
held at the beginning of the season to determine who is on
the team.‘The eight selected riders receive the beneﬁt of
having their entry fees paid for by the club, which club
members areresponsible for if they wish to enter competi-
tions. .

PIST enjoyed some success at the recent Tussey
Mountain Big-Air competition on Jan. 19. Tyler Calabrese,
one of PIST’s top riders, placed second in the men’s divi-
sion, and Erin Hoban placed ﬁrst in the Women’s division.
Dania Rudolph was not so lucky, as she tore her anterior
cruciate ligament practicing for the ﬁnal event; She placed

. fourth unaware of the injury.

The competitions usually consist of a big-air contest
and sometimes a half-pipe or boarder cross competition.
The hosts of the competition usually appoint judges for the
big-air and half-pipe competitions. According to PIST
president Pat Lanigan, this was a source of controversy at
a recent Penn State competition. According to Lanigan, the
judges at the recent competition were guilty of some
“home cooking.” ‘

PIST has also been successful in that membership has
steadily increased since the establishment of the club. Also,
Lanigan is optimistic about the club’s chances of receiving
increased ftmding from Student Government Board which
already supplies transportation to all of the trips and com-
petitions PIST attends.

The club usually takes weekend trips once a month to
locations in New York, Vermont and West Virginia. They
also try to attend a local resort, such as Seven Springs, once
a month. Larger trips over winter and spring break take
place atmually to such places.as Canada and Switzerland.

PIST has been able to secure discounts for its mem-
bers from several manufactures, such as Sims Snowboards
and Droors Clothing Co. as well as local retailer The
Headboard Shop. Membership dues are $25, and both men
and women are welcome to join at any time.

PIST Vice President W111 Hancock perhaps said it
best: “PIST is a vehicle to help broke college kids to go to
resorts and mountains not usually accessible through other
means, and to meet people interested in things you are.”

Interested students can visit the PIST Web site at
www.pistsnowboard.com or can contact Lanigan at
pres@pistsnowboard.com.

said it’s a shame that the NHL  a back .

. seat to the Olympics. I can’t make any

sense out of that and I can’t believe _

Mario’s actions are being questioned in
Pittsburgh.

Pens fans: you deserve a boo that
makes Kobe sound like Philly people actu-
ally like him. '

Now, let’s look at some good fans.
How about those Charlotte Hornets fans?

Here are some fans who are absolute-
ly,loyal to their team — they just-hate

owner George Shinn and for good reason. ’

Shinn is a guy who tried to move the

team before. He refused to sell part of the’

team to Michael Jordan, who could proba-
bly be governor of North Carolina if he
really wanted. And he’s been accused of
sexual misconduct.

Shinn’s just not a nice guy and the fans
don’t want him "around anymore. So they

stopped going to games. They denied his ‘
repeated requests for a new publicly-ﬁmd- .

ed arena. .

Recently they’ve approved a new
arena under one condition —— Shinn sells
the team. Shinn has stated he has no such
intentions. A

Now NBA oﬂicials have actually had

i»’."4 11'}!-‘!"_:’ «T 3 ‘

the nerve to criticize these fans, because

their actions toward Shinn might scare off

other owners.

Yeah, it would certainly be a shame to
scare oﬁ other greedy, sexual harassing
owners. '

If the NBA officials were smart
enough to think of the fans for once, they
would see that there are some great ones in
Charlotte. The Hornets led the league in
attendance back in the late ‘80s and early
‘90s when they stunk..

Hornets fans are the type of fans every 1

team should want. They stick with their
team through thick and thin, and they let it
be known when they don’t like something.
Their possible replacements, New Orleans
fans, don’t even bother to pack the

Superdome for Saints’ games most of the

time.

So _if the ‘NBA does approve the
Hornets’ move to New Orleans, it deserves
what it gets  low attendance in another
city that’ll come to hate Shinn.

And, of course, it deserves a boo of
my expertise.

Ahem. . .boo!

Shaun Grzﬁin is a columnist for The Pitt
News. He thinks Mario doesn’t deserve a
single boo. «

from behind the are, having made 47 three-
pointers this season, good for a 38.5 percent.

Panther guard Brandin KI1ight’s play
has remained solid of late, despite his being
nagged by a myriad of minor injuries.
Knight" leads the Panthers in scoring with 15
points per game and has a team high 57
steals on the season. ‘

The superb play of guard Julius Page
and forwards J aron Brown and Ontario Lett
has spearheaded Pitt’s defensive effort. Lett
has been solid oil’ the bench, averaging 8.5

For the Panthers to be successful
against WVU, they must continue to domi-
nate the boards, continue to actively involve
their bench and not rely too heavily on the
three-point shot While the Mountaineers
will have their hands full trying to keep up
with Pitt, they may ﬁnd some success if they
can replicate the jump defense that None
Dame‘ used against the Panthers and if they
can signiﬁcantly improve their rebounding.

Tip-off for tomorrow night’s game is 9
p.m.

‘ Rounding out the trio on Saturday
will be Ursinus College, a’ small school
near Philadelphia that is ranked No. 1
among Division III schoolsand ranked
fourth among all schools in the northeast
region. The Bears (8-4) are led by Jumaah
Johnson, who is ranked second among
Division III gymnasts for all-around
points with an average of 36.6 points per
meet.

Much like the Panthers, Ursinus’
scores have also been slowly improving

during the season.

Last weekend, Casey Aivazian
recorded a school record 9.6 on her ﬂoor
routine to lead the team to a school high
47.075 total score for the event, but it was-
n’t enough as the Bears lost to Temple
187.50 to 182.375.

Saturday should prove to be extra
special since many alumni of the
Panthers’ gymnastics squad are expected
to attend Saturday’s meet. Yohman feels
they won’t walk away disappointed. A

“The kids are really motivated right
now,” Yohman said. “I feel like we’re on a
