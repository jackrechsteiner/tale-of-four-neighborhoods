It was not certain by 5 a.m. which
candidate had become president-elect of
the United States. After an initial con-
cession by Al Gore at 2:30 a.m., news
sources declared the race was too close
to call and may involve a recount of
Florida’s votes.

Sources initially declared that the
state’s 25 electoral votes helped George
W. Bush to edge Gore in his race for
270 electoral votes needed to win the
election. At press time, Wisconsin,
Oregon and Florida were still unde-
clared. Gore rescinded his concession
near 3 a.m. ,

This year’s presidential election
had been hailed as the closest in 40
years, since John F. Kennedy defeated
Richard Nixon in 1960. As the night
unfolded though, this year turned out to
be the wildest election yet.

By 7:45 p.m., Bush had obtained a
large lead. Kentucky, Indiana, South

-Carolina, Virginia and Georgia Agave

Bush a total of 54 electoral votes as
compared to, Gore’s three from
Vermont. 

Then during the next hour, Gore

, won, among others, Michigan and

Pennsylvania, two. of the “swing state
tri—fecta” and considered crucial for any
chance of a Gore victory.

Missouri started the craziness of the
evening at 8 when the polling stations in
St. Louis were packed and local offi-
cials opted to keep them open for three
more hours. Immediately, the
Bush/Cheney lawyers contested the
decision, but they were overruled. Bush
ended up winning ﬂiat state.

North in Maine, the only state in
which the electoral votes can be split
between the candidates, Gore had only

  

Editor’s Note:

As of press time, the outcome of the’
presidential election was uncertain.

The race had quickly turned from a

predicted Bush victory to an appar-
ently mandated recount of the popu-

lar vote in Florida, one of the swing

states. Some of the stories in the

paper dealing with the election were

written in accordance with the

national media’s assumption of
Bush’s victory. The results of the

election will not be officially known

until after votes in Florida are

recounted. The president-elect will

then be named at that time, which

may be sometime this afternoon.

three of a possible four votes for most
of the evening. It took most of the night
for him to get the fourth one.

But the most bizarre events of the
night happened in Florida.

Near 8 p.m., networks reported that
Gore carried Florida in what looked like
a huge tumaround for him.

Bush’s advisers claimed on the air
that the decision was rushed and incor-
rect, and at 10:20 p.m., Florida was
taken away from Gore and remained
undecided. ~

_ NBC reported around midnight that

ballot boxes from Miami, Tampa Bay

and Palm Beach County were missing.
After the boxes had been found‘ and
checked for tampering, Florida voting
officials announced that the mishap was
a result of “human error.”

Confusion in the voting booths
reportedly caused people who thought
that they were Voting for Gore to vote
for Reform party candidate Patrick J.
Buchanan. .

Florida’s results were delayed even
further, because the actual number of
absentee ballots was double than esti-
mated. The nearly one million ballots
were each sealed in separate envelopes.

As of 4 a.m., Florida remained-

undeclared, as the difference in votes
was less than one—half of 1 percent.

Under Florida state law, a recount is ‘

mandatory when decided by such a
small margin.
There were also strange events here
in Pittsburgh, where more than 1,000
voters were tumed away at the polls
because of problems with registration
papers. Some of the voters claimed sab-
otage, but local attorneys said that
glitches like this happen at every elec-
tion and that the votes will be counted.
A As expected, Bush won his home
state of Texas, but he also won Gore’s
home state of Tennessee and Clinton’s

home state of Arkansas. Bush called the 0 =
victory in Tennessee “interesting,”_ ’

while Gore called it “crushing.”

Gore and Bush exchanged leads
through the night until 1:30 this mom-
ing when Gore won Washington, tying
the candidates at 242 electoral votes
each. At that point, only ﬁve states were
left. — Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida,
Nevada. and Oregon.

Oregon did not get its votes count-
ed in time because of its mail-in system.
Wisconsin also did not fmish counting
in time. __

As of 4 a.m., Nevada’s four elec-
tqral votes were awarded to Bush, while
Gore won Iowa’s seven, giving Gore a
249-246 lead, with three states’ votes
remaining to be counted.

Turning out in record numbers, Pitt
students went to the polls yesterday to cast

‘ their ballot for the presidential election.

More than 900 students in the 4th
Ward, 7th and 8th districts, pulled levers
at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial between
7 a.m. and 8 p.m. '

While 900 is not a large portion of
students on campus, it greatly exceeds the
60 students who voted in the 1996 presi-
dential election. Plus, there, were numer-
ous voting sites in Oakland where off-
campus students voted. -

Many attribute the increased turnout
to the tight race between George W. Bush
and Al Gore. Many polls, including
Gallup, had the two candidates at a dead
heat up until Election Day. However,
there is speculation, because of the margin

of error in poll participation-, the results

may not be truly accurate.

Issues such as gun control, education,
foreign policy, Social Security and taxes
can also be credited with student turnout.

Ruth Mouly of Oakland, a longtime
voter and poll volunteer, was thrilled with
the youth-voter turnout.

According to Mouly, among the
groups of voters, more younger people
voted today as compared to the past. She
credits the increase to all of the attention
paid to Pittsburgh by the candidates, espe-
cially in Oakland.

“Our state carries so many electoral
votes, it’s the ﬁfth-largest state,” Mouly

said. “It’s important to vote ir1 this elec-

Klink inlsenate race

tion, because it’s going to determine a lot
of things in our country.” _

Mouly, who is most concerned with
the issues of Medicare and prescription
drug proposals, expressed her support for
Gore.

“Gore has so much more experience
in domestic and foreign aﬂairs,” Mouly
said.

First-time voter Derek Vogclslog, a
freshman ﬁnance major, has not paid
much attention to the election but is inter-
ested in financial aid for students and
Social Security, two issues which will
affect him in the future. He declined to to
say whom he voted for.

Freshman Elizabeth Brightbill was
adamant in her support of Gore. 0

“Hc’s just a lotsmartcr and his
stances on everything are just better,”
Brightbill said.

Brightbill was also encouraging oth-
ers to get out and vote yesterday. I

“I’m surprised more students don’t
vote,” Brightbill said. “It’s a chance to
make a difference, and it doesn’t even
take ﬁve minutes.”

Tara Herman, a student at the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, has always Voted
and made her way to the polls yesterday

to cast her vote for Nader.

“I feel they are both evil,” Herman
said of the other candidates.

“I am basically hoping the third party

will get 5 percent of the vote,” Herman
said. “This two—party system is ridiculous.

Republicans celebrat town

DAVE HARTMAN

Assistant News Editor

Dark suits, dark dresses and dark
beers filled the 17th floor of the
Westin William Penn Downtown last
night. A crowd of hundreds gathered
in the grand ballroom amid balloons,
television sets and reporters to wel-
come Sen. Rick Santorum, R—Pa., to
his second six—year term in office.

Santorum won the race for senator
with approximately 53 percent of the
vote, edging outDemocratic nominee
Ron Klink.

The supporters, many wearing
“Bush 2000” pins or toting signs,
began assembling in the ballroom
early in the evening. A jumbo—sized
television screen broadcast the latest
news on the election. as the crowd
waited in anticipation for the results.

“Run, governor, run,” Santorum
campaign manager Keith Schmidt said

into a microphone as the latest elec-
toral count appeared on the screen.
George W. Bush led Al Gore 190 elec-
toral votes to 183, maintaining the
slight lead the Republican candidate
had enjoyed almost all evening. The
crowd screamed in excitement.

“I’m a big supporter" of the
Republican Party,” said ,Pitt junior
Kimberly Barron. “I came out tonight
to support [Santorum] and Bush and
the other Republican candidates.”

Barron worked for Santorum’s
campaign as he sought re—election to
his second term as U.S. senator.

Part way through the evening, the
major television networks adjusted
their electoral distributions, removing
Florida from the list of states that

Gore had won. The crowd again went,

wild, screaming and waving signs.

“I am hearing the networks are up
to some ‘fuzzy math,’” Schmidt said,
referring to what has become a Gore
catch phrase during this campaign.

Nick Havens,
president of the
C o 1 1 e g e
Republicans,
said he liked

Bush’s chances
‘ in the election.
But, acknowl-
edging a close
race, he insisted
that the College
R e p u b l i c a n s
would not leave
until the bitter
end.

“I don’t think
we’re going to
leave until
every last vote
is counted,”
Havens said.

MIKE Horz/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITO

Rick Santorum was re-elected to the U.S. Senate last night.

As martini glasses accumulated on
nearby tables and chairs, the crowd
became increasingly excited about the
night’s events. But Santorum had still
not appeared.

“We want Rick. We want‘ Rick,”
the crowd chanted.

Allegheny County Executive Jim
Roddy then took the stage to introduc
the incumbent senator. , *

“There is absolutely no one that is
as tenacious a competitor and cam-
paigner as Rick Santorum,” Roddy
said.

His endorsement of Santorum
came alongside a plug for Bush.

“George W. Bush has [shown]
how he can do it in Texas, and pretty
soon he’s gonna do it all over
America,” Roddy said.

Night of stress ends abruptly for

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
News Editor

At 1:05 am. — and withAl Gore and
George W. Bush at a dead heat, each post-
ing 242 electoral votes — a mysterious
voice echoed through the Democratic victo-
ry party in the South Side.

The party was over and the
International Brotherhood of Elecuical
Workers Union headquarters was closing hr
10 minutes.

House lights came up and the volume
on the large screen projecting CNN’s live
election broadcast went down. Volunteers
began taking down pro-Ron Klink signs
and other Democratic posters.

Theiremaining crowd of nearly 150
stood dumbstruck Television crews, dor-

mant for hours while the tie persisted, sud-
denly scrambled for video of the disap-
pointed crowd scurrying out of the union
building.

It was an anticlimactic ending to a night
full of false victories and ﬂayed nerves.

What began as a pre—emptory victory
party for Klink ended by 10:30 p.m., when
he conceded defeat to his Republican oppo-
nent, incumbent Sen. Rick Santorum.

University Democrat Meghan Rice
commended Klink for his graciousness.

“He took it very well,” she said. “His
speech was very good.”

Rice and University Democrat Megan
Johnson agreed that Klink maintained
extraordinary poise, despite the fact that his
children were so upset.

“We saw his daughters crying,” Rice
said. “They were hysterical.”

Even though the crowd at the union
headquarters in the South Side hadgthinned
out after Klink’s concession speech, loyal
Gore supporters had remained with hopes
of celebrating his victory.

“It’s gonna be very very close,” said

Seth Tryninewski, a sophomore business
major. “But I think it’s gonna go Gore.”

red for Bush and blue for Gore, and as the
tally of each candidates’ electoral votes
revealed a tie, the crowd grew restless.

"This atmosphere is really uptight,”
Rice said. ‘

President Stephanie Strazisar looked
pale and nervous.

“I’m scared. I’m so scared right now,”
she said

She wasn’t alone.

Across the auditorium, Gore supporters

Roddy encouraged supporters to
congratulate Democrats who voted for
Republican candidates in yesterday’s

election. He pointed out that there are

500,000 more registered Democrats
than Republicans in Pennsylvania and
applauded all those who helped re-
elect Santorum.

After two videos about Santorum
were projected on the giant television
screen, the candidate addressed the
crowd in- a brief victory speech.

“Just a couple of minutes ago, I
received a call from Congressman
Klink, conceding the race,” Santorum
announced to the enthused crowd. A

dential election.

More than 900 students in the
4th Ward, 7th and 8th districts,
pulled levers at Soldiers and Sailors

— While 900 is not a large portion

there were numerous voting sites in

Student takes to the streets to drive the vote home   

KATE WHITMORE
The Pitt News

It’s 4 p.m. on Election Day. I have a
full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes,
and I’m driving voters to the polls.

I followed the “Honk for Gore”
signs down Frankstown Road yesterday
to state Rep. Tony Deluca’s headquar-
ters in Penn Hills. Located in a strip mall

next to the Phat Hair salon, I walked in

with no idea what to expect.

Part of me was expecting the
Pandemonium of ringing phones and the
bustle of people, but it wasn’t like that at
all. After checking in with three union
representatives, they informed me that
nobody needed a ride at that time.

, A little bummed, I took a look at my
surroundings. Folding chairs and tables
were scattered across the room, and
signs touting Democratic candidates
such as Bob Casey Jr. and Ron Klink
adorned the white Walls. There were
only two phones in the place, and they
were both silent.

I took a seat with the other volun-
teers, who were in the middle of a dis-
cussion about Bill Clinton’s role in Al
Gore’s candidacy. People were pretty
passionate, but aspiring lawyer Dana
Richardson said that things were sub-
dued compared to earlier in the day.

“People were really pumped up,” ”

Richardson said. “They were also pretty

scared about the way things could go in

the polls.” Since 1 p.m., Richardson had
only given two voters a ridehto the polls,
and I wondered if I’d getfmy chance.

Donna Dow was similarly satisfied‘

with her volunteer efforts. ‘She took the

H day off work to canvass Wilkinsburg
with her husband John, urging people to

get out and vote. Dow said that she got
a lot of positive "responses from resi-
dents about the state of the economy
during the last eight years. _
“For lower—class people to recog-
nize that makes us feel good,” said Dow,

looking haggard with blond hair ﬂop-,



with her cousin’s baby in tow. Nay—Nay,
she called her, looked smashing in a.
Blue’s Clues hat, and at six months was
already half the size of the diminutive
Meredith. Once in the car, she told me
that she still didn’t know for whom she
would vote.

‘‘I’d vote for Clinton again if I
could,” Meredith lamented. “I think that
everyone made too big a deal about him
messing with those women.” _ .'

We chatted while trying to find the
Johnson School. Meredith had never
voted there before, and this was also her
first time having someone else take her.
After several wrong turns and a phone
call back to Deluca headquarters, we
finally found it.

Gore/Lieberman signs decorated the
school’s lawn, and a group of smiling
volunteers ushered us in. I took over
Nay—Nay duty, and sat with her in a
metal chair while Meredith stood in line.
The baby garnered lots of attention from
the poll workers and she also tried to eat
my hair.

At first, part of me wondered why
Meredith needed a ride (it turned out
that the school was only two blocks
from her house), but after holding Nay-
Nay for 10 minutes, I couldn’t imagine

_ toting her one block, let alone two, and I

didn’t see a stroller in her apartment.
After voting, Meredith told me that

she voted for Gore. “I’m happy with the

way things are going,” she explained.

My next stop was Montier Street,
and the home of Josephine Zelleous.
Her neighbor, Doris Wilkerson, also
came along for the ride. But I didn’t
think twice about Zelleous’ ability to get
to the polls as she struggled down the
steps of her house with a cane.

“My legs were never bad enough to
need a ride before,” Zelleous said, as
though she needed to apologize for
accepting a free ride.

We started off to St. Mark’s Church
but had to turn around because Zelleous
forgot her glasses. I volunteered to get
them, and got my shock for the evening.

and politically pumped up, and for most
of the evening I didn’t feel at all worried
for my safety. But in a house full of
feisty children, one of whom gladly let
me in, I saw a pistol lying on the coach
in next to an overweight young man. I
quickly retrieved the glasses and hurried
out of the house feeling very out of
place in a neighborhood less than two
miles from my own.

FROM PAGE 9

I mentioned nothing to Zelleous or.

her companion, and high-tailedit to the
church.

St. Mark’s was a hub of activity. We
arrived at the same time as a bus of

senior citizens, all of whom needed a

hand getting around.
“No miss, you have to getback in

line!” yelled one worker as she gently
steered an elderly woman wearing a col-
ored track suit back to her place.

A teen-age girl slumped beside me
and stared languidly at the wall while
waiting for her mother. Businesswomen
held younger childrens’ hands and old
men in glasses nodded to their neigh-
bors.

Wilkerson, who hadn’t voted in
years, said she was glad she broke tradi-
tion tonight.

“People kept telling me I helped
some presidents get elected by not vot~

'ing,” Wilkerson said, explaining her

return to the polls.

Both women agreed that health
care, Social Security and Medicare were
their chief concerns.

Zelleous defended her vote for
Gore.

“I’m a widow with a fixed income,
and I want to know that someone will
stand up for me,” she said, adding that
without government help, her prescrip-
tion drugs would cost more than $500 a
month.

Even though I was driving forthe
Democrats, it was obvious that senti-
ment in Wilkinsburg, Pa., was similar to
Zelleous’. From the mumblings and dis-
cussions I overheard at the polls,
nobody was championing Bush.

Zelleous said that people don’t'nec-
essarily understand the concerns of
senior citizens, and she echoed
Meredith’s sentiments that things have
been going pretty well under the current
administration.

“We don’t need things to get better,”
she said. “We just want to survive.”

‘ Voter turnout was commendable

Perhaps it was strictly because
the 2000 elections included a presi-
dential race. Perhaps it was because
the 20()() elections included what was
anticipated to be an extremely close
presidential race. Perhaps it was
because volunteers across the country
worked especially hard to register vot-
ers and campaign for their candidates.

Whatever the reason, voter
tumout yesterday was considerably
largerthanithas been inpast years, in
the area and across the nation.

One factor behind the high
tumout was a record number of voters
using absentee ballots. Thirty-one
thousand people from Allegheny
County requested absentee ballots,
slightly up from the norm of 25,000 to
30,000.

In most states absentee ballots
have to be mailed in well before
Election Day; Pennsylvania residents
voting absentee had to send theirs in
before the end of October. It is inspir-
ing to know that so many people pri-
oritized voting enough to meet these
deadlines.

Absentee ballots were an option.
for the many Pitt students whose per-‘
manent residences are located in other
states or districts, and it can be hoped
that there were many Pitt students
among the absentee voters. College
students tend to be perpetual procras-
tinators; it is rather amazing that a por-
tion of us became organized in time to

vote absentee. 8'

In the future, though, there is an
easier option — just re-register in
Allegheny County. If you are already
registered in your home district, this

involves ﬁlling out just one simple A

form; after doing so you can vote at
convenient locations on and around

campus for the duration of your resi- '

dency in Pittsburgh.

Checking boxes on an absentee
ballot can feel a bit anticlimactic; by
voting locally you are entitled to
choosing your candidates in a charm-
ingly old-school metal booth. More
importantly, you get to vote for the
local politicians who will be repre-
senting your interests as long as you
are living and studying in the area.

In the future we may see the
emergence of even more convenient
methods of voting. You can now ﬁle
your state income taxes online; voting
via the computer could be the next
step in this trend. Online voting would
be particularly beneﬁcial for elderly
and severely disabled people, for
whom getting to the polls may pose a
signiﬁcant challenge, as well as for
busy, computer loving collegians. *

Willi such innovations, we might
witness even higher numbers of peo-
ple voting in years to come. But in
terms of sheer excitementtas well as
turnout, the 2000 race has already
established itself as a tough act to fol-
low.

Coopring with Christians

As a non-Christian, I ﬁnd one of the most
troublesome passages in the Bible to be the fol-
lowing command, attributed to the apostle Paul:
“Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbe-
lievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness
with‘ unrighteousness? and ‘what communion
hath light with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14,
Kinglames Version).

Let’s set aside for the moment the fact that I
don’t appreciate being equated with

—— and don’t, for that matter, appre-
ciate having billions of Hindus,     
Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, indigenous
religionists, atheists and agnostics
similarly viewed. Instead, I wonder“. Just what
does this verse mean‘?

Some  View it as a condemnation
of interfaith dating and marriage. Others view it
as a warning to avoid involvement with interfaith
organizations. I suppose that extreme radicals,
like the late David Koresh and his Branch
Davidians, seeitasacalltomilitantseparatism

Because we were trainees, none of us were
allowed to leave our company area alone, and so

_Evan needed a “buddy” to accompany him to

evangelical Christian services on Sunday morn-
ing. I gladly volunteered for the job. Although

A meal plan is better than grocery shopping

Even if you think the cafeteria food is

absolutely horrendous, there are actually,

beneﬁts to having a meal plan. I lived in the
donnsforthelastthreeyears andgotpretty
sick of the meal plan: I was tired of Schenley
and disgusted by Eddie’s, and I hadn’t been
in C-Side since I was a freshman.

When I was ﬁnally out of the dorms and
into an apartment with a bright, shiny
kitchen, I was thrilled — especially since I
was a block away fnom_Giant Eagle. I ﬁg-
ured my roommates and I could stock up our
cabinets with a variety of tasty food. This is,
however, more easily said than done.

Upon entering Giant Eagle, I was
awestruck by the variety. Schenley was
familiar tenitory: There was the same old
Manchu Wok, pasta with marinara sauce and
sandwiches wrapped in dilferent colored tin

I foil just sitting there -getting soggy.

I passed produce, snacks, chips, pret-
zels, milk cartons,7.;eggs, cheese, soups, sal-
ads, beans, candy, "frozen entrees and butter.
What should I buy? I knew I needed milk,
bread, meat and other staples, but somehow
I was sidetracked from my ﬁrst entrance.

Istartedoifattheproduceaisleandwas
immediately drawn to the grapes, so I picked
up a package of the red, seedless variety and
headed over to the chip aisle. I spent a lot of

time looking at the dilferent brands of potato
chips, Doritos and pretzels, then looked for
the ones on sale. But I decided that it was
junk food and therefore I shouldn’t buy it.
Next I arrived in the candy aisle, and
since I wanted to buy gum and Twizzlers, I
said, “To hell with it” — the chips did look
good, so I went back to pick up some;
I Iﬁguredthatbecauselwasbuyingallof
this junk food, I should buy more fruit since
that would somehow oﬁset it. So I had to go
backtothe produce section While looking at
apples, I bumped into an old friend, Donald,
whoIhadn’tseeninayear. Hetoldmehe
had graduated, was working and also lived
across the street. Ilookedto see what he was
buying, and all that he had were two giant
bottles.of Coca-Cola. So I decided to buy
some pop and some bread too.
By the time I got to the checkout line, I

’wasﬂustered.Ihadtakenalongtimetrying

todecidewhattobuy andthenlhadto stand
in line with my bread, chips, cheese, apples,
Twizzlers and Diet Coke.

And then I discovered ﬂiat I had forgot-
tenmyGiantEaglecardandhadtopayfull
price for everything. When I came home, it
seemed like I had nothing to eat even though
I just went to the grocery store.

I looked in my cabinets. There was

nothing but pancake mix, and there was no
way Iwas going to put any effort into cook-
ing pancakes. Another problem with not
being on the meal plan: You have to cook.
After a long day of classes, you usually
come home dead ﬁred with no inclination to
lift your ﬁnger, much less get out pots and
pans to make a full dimer.

The next day, I woke up and realized

New IDs need to be
re-evaluated

A Pitt ID should be just that: some-E
thing that says ‘fMy name is Joe Godzilla‘
and I go to Pitt}? These new IDs, however, 
let you have bank information and who
knows what else hibernating in them. I can
only speak for _myself, but there is no way I want Pitt
having any information concerning my bank statements.

Think about it: Do you want Pitt to know that on
Oct. 31, you made a purchase of $22.50 at Bob’s Mothra

- Shop? What’s  scary about this whole new ID is

that it's mandatory to get a new one. Mandatory? This
isn’t a vaccine: It’s an ID. _ -

Is it so important that everyone must have it by next
semester? It seems to me that the powers that be are just
trying to see how much they can abuse the student pop-
ulation. Inch by inch they’re taking the little freedoms we
have.

One day, you’ll wake up and they’re going to have
mandatory microchips being put into our skulls. But it’ll
betoolatetodo anything. - ~

So here are words of wisdom: Do not take your free-

. dom for granted — it is not indestructible and ‘one day it
might notbe there. ~

It’s good tohsee Mischa Gelrnan addressing an issue

V like population (Oct 26, “The real population problem”),

something rarely covered in the media. He does make some
good points about things such as declining fertility and
unequal distribution of food, but unfortunately his article
mimics the same oldconservative dogmas.

Overpopnlation is worrisome .

lation to reach one billion. Now, over the last 40 to 50 years,
the population of this planet has doubled.»

He echoes the conservatives’ pipe dreams by saying,
“The world can support eight billion people living an Indian
lifestyle.” Last time I checked, even Indians living the
Indian lifestyle weren’t doing great. People there still live
and die on the streets, forests are still being decimated,
rivers are being polluted Even if~we could feed eight billion
people, where would they live, work, dispose of their
waste? .

Even since ancient times, there have been many cases
in history where humans, by sheer numbers, have overtaxed

ple, _in the case of Easter Island, the natives were unable to
escape to anywhere else. When ﬂie population pressures got
too great, they resorted to cannibalism and warfare. Perhaps
this should serve as a lesson for modern culture.

the population issue is practically invisible in our culture.

, I have these views? I think not.

Women’s conference
was not inclusive

When I read the article on the
women’s conference (Oct. 23,
“Forming the old girls’ club”), I was
 not surprised to hear that what was
,  acclaimed as a wonderfully diverse
event where all kinds of women could revel in their
sisterhood actually fell very short of this diversity.
Upon reading the list of campus organizations
involved, I noticed that the scale was signiﬁcantly
tipped toward the liberal side, and there was a lack
of religious and more conservative groups, groups
I’m sure would have jumped at the chance to be
involved in a women’s conference if asked.

Why were these groups missing, one might ask?
Is it because they have no female members or are
not concerned with “women’s issues?” I don’t think
so.

I know that, as a Roman Catholic woman who is
pro-life and opposed to birth control, I do not feel
welcome at events or meetings that are supposed to
be open to all women. Am I less of a woman because

Am I less of a woman because I want to be a
stay-at-home mom because I still believe in tradi-
tional values? Certainly not.

My suggestion is that next time an event is being
planned that is for women, it should be for all
women. Why not have a conference that has work-
shops run by Students for Reproductive Freedom
and another by Students For Life? Then true diver-
sity will be reached and we can escape our limited
viewpoints.

Swimmers Miah Heath and Mike
Grube are as close to a sure thing
when meet time approaches as men’s
head coach Chuck Knoles can get.

Heath won the l00—yard butterﬂy
in Friday’s 149-91 win over North
Carolina State in 50.88, seconds and
was the anchor on the 200 medley
relay team that finished in first with a
time of 1:34.26.

Grube edged out Heath in the 50
freestyle with a time of 20.84. Heath
finished in second place with a time of
21.20.

“We’re learning to "be able to rely
on them in dual meets,” Knoles said.
“As a team, that’s nice to have.”

In Saturday’s three—team meet
with North Carolina State and
Rutgers, Heath and Grube competed
well again.

Both competed in the 400 medley
relay, and finished in first, along with
Steve Siler and Randy Gertenbach
with a time of 3:25.31.

Grube then picked up a victory in
the 200 freestyle, beating Siler by 19
hundredths of a second.

3 in ALHOTO ED 0

Max von Bodungen earned a surprise victory in the 200 individual medley.

Heath was the top Pitt swimmer in I
the 50 freestyle and second overall
behind the Wolfpack’s Greg Solt.
Heath’s time of 21.35 barely beat
teammate Mike Demos, who finished
third with a time of 21.42.

“The thing about those guys is
that they work off of each other,”
Knoles said. “At St. Bonaventure
early in the season, Mike nearly
ripped his toenail off and still won the
100 free, and at Syracuse, Mike

slipped off the block and Miah picked
it up and won the race.”

Transfer Max von Bodungen
cruised to the victory in the 200
freestyle with a time of 1:40.85 and
was part of the winning 800 freestyle
relay team.

“Max really stepped up for the
meets this weekend,” Knoles said. .

The Panthers topped the Wolfpack
again on Saturday by a score of 146-
95 and beat Big East foe Rutgers, 177-
65, to move to 5-0 on the season and
2-0 in the conference. '

Michael Wells won ‘the 3-meter
diving event, a day after finishing
behind the _ Wolfpack’s Patrick
Roberts. Wells scored 275.15 points,
topping Roberts by 2.20 points- ‘

After the 400 medley relay and
200 freestyle victories, von Bodungen
won the 200 individual medley, a race
he doesn’t usually run.

His time of 1:54.23 topped Braden
Holloway of the Wolfpack by 0.72
seconds.

“He’s a tremendous asset to our
team,” Knoles said. “And to think,
he’s not an IM’er.” *

Pitt’s women’s tennis team wrapped up its

In the singles competition, Nikki Borza
played Kyli Lasalle of Seton Hall. The Pitt
sophomore came out on the short end of a 6-1, 7-

the Pirates.

“Lasalle was very strong,” Dieffenbach said.
“She was an intense player who hit the ball pret-

ty hard and didn’t miss too much.”

The singles competition consisted of 80 play-

Renick finally settles on uide of hings

FRAN AIELLO

Staff Writer

Stacy Renick got her first varsity
volleyball starting position as a
sophomore at Eagan High School in
Minnesota. She had been playing the
game since the eighth grade and was
awarded a starting spot under the
close scrutiny of her coach.

Even though she loved the game
and she worked hard to be the best,
Renick had trouble understanding
why it was so tough to please her
coach.

It all turned out for the best,
though. As she looks back now, six
years later, she feels that the coach
really helped build her confidence and
make her more aggressive.

“I got yelled at for stupid stuff
like missing a pass or missing a hit,
stupid stuff that I shouldn’t have been
doing,” Renick recalled. “But I was so
nervous that it just happened.”

Her desire to stop the small mis-
takes her coach “fussed” about and
her pure enjoyment of the game kept
her from quitting and also helped her
to develop into the collegiate volley-
ball force she is today.

Renick and her teammates are
preparing for the Big East Conference

postseason tournament, and she feels
that all the scrutinizing has helped her
to have faith in her coaches’ actions as
they switched her through positions
and even made her sit out.

Aside from playing for her high
school team in Eagan, Renick also
held a spot on a club team in the
Northern Lights Club League, a team
that was ranked ninth in national com-
petition in 1995.

After her successful pre—collegiate
career, she had her choice of schools
and went about her decision by con-
sidering educational as well as volley—
ball programs.

“I wanted to go into engineering,”
Renick said. “This college was my
favorite by far. I liked the atmosphere
here.” , _

Renick also liked the coaching
team that was here when she started
and they liked her, too.

Head coach Cindy Alvear, now
retired, didn’t take as long to put
Renick’s name in the starting lineup.
She appeared in every 1997 game, her
freshman year, playing middle hitter.
Renick continued playing her normal
position until the middle of her sopho-
more year, when she got switched to
the outsidehitter position. ~ . V

“I was hoping _to play theimiddle

position the whole time, but,now I like ’

the outside a lot better,” Renick said.
Alvearl kept her ‘in the outside
position until the middle of Renick’s
junior year. She led the team in hitting

set career highs in five separate cate—

  Look to Aleutians
for cause of demise

Puzzled by the Steelers’ and
Panthers’ losses this past weekend?
Looking for answers to why the

‘ Steelers’ defense could blow a lead

in the final minutes and
how the Panthers could
lose to North Carolina
while being nowhere near a
basketball court?

Well it took some dig-
ging and some imagina-
tion, but I’ve found your
answer, and it lies only 0
about 4,000 miles away.

Yes, that long 331141111 Urlfnn stop ,0 the Titans’
Alaskan archipelago that offense in the waning

stretches into the Bering Sea, that’s
what I’m saying. '

In an article from
Angeles Times on Monday, Marla
Cone described how the Aleutians,
once home to more than 100,000
sea otters, have undergone drastic
ecological changes in the past 10
years. _
The sea otters have all but dis-
appeared along with the luscious,
submerged forests of kelp.

Killer whales and sea urchins
now run amuck around the islands.
The aquatic life on the Aleutians
has been turned upside down.

Cone wrote, “If this rugged,
remote ecosystem is collapsing, can
any place on Earth be safe?”

No, when such an ecosystem’

collapses, there are global conse-
quences, and they finally rippled
down to the fragile Pittsburgh foot-
ball ecosystem this weekend.

How else can you explain two
dropped punts by Tim Stein? A lack
of concentration? A bad week of
practice?

Stein’s botches have been the
result of a phenomenon more than
20 years in the making.

Sea lion numbers in Alaska
started to dwindle right around
1977. Sea lions were the main.sus-
tenance of killer whales, so when

moments of the game, but there
were unusual ecological factors at
work.

The Aleutians were also affect-

ed by a mild rise in temperature in"

the late ‘70s. Just a two degree
Celsius increase .killed all the
plankton, shrimp and crabs.

So wouldn’t that slight rise in
temperature on the Aleutians
explain why the usually superb

Steeler defense couldn’t keep up

with Titan receivers?
I don’t know. These ecological
explanations might sound a little

.unbelievable. Maybe there is some

other answer for why both teams
suffered baffling losses this week-
end. .

But it’s better than hearing
about how a bad week of practice
accounted for a loss.

Can the Pittsburgh football
ecosystem rebound from such cata-
strophic events? I hope so,.but only
time will tell.

Before you put the ‘Panthers

ahead of the Hurricanes or the

Steelers ahead of the Eagles this
week, think to yourself: “What’s
going on in the Aleutians today?”

Women’s swimming and diving

The Panthers women’s team com-
peted in a quadrangular meet on
Friday at Miami (Ohio), along with
Kenyon and N otre Dame.

Pitt defeated the host Redhawks,
157-126, but suffered its first two
losses of the season to Kenyon and
Notre Dame.

The Panthers lost to Kenyon, the
defending Division III national cham-
pions, 148—143,’and were defeated by
the Fighting Irish, 196-98.

“It was a little disappointing,”
said women’s head coach Marian
Cassidy Keen, “but we certainly
learned a lot from racing ‘against
N otre Dame and Kenyon.”

Pitt crushed the Ladies last year,
225-75, but Cassidy Keen said she
thought that Kenyon was more pre-
pared for the meet this year and that

_travel caught up with the Panthers a

bit.
“We were a little off in places and

' that added up,” Cassidy Keen said.-

Senior Katie Hunter finished in
second place in the 50 free, trailing
only Beth Galloway of Kenyon in the
standings.

She also finished a close second
to Danielle Hulick of Notre Dame in
the 100 freestyle.

Her times of 24.40 in the 50 free’
and 53.63, in the 100 free were a com- _

bined 0.18 seconds off the lead.
“I was very pleased with most of

' our efforts on Friday,” Cassidy Keen

said. “Especially in the second half of
the meet.” ,

Freshman Jen O’Brien was a sec-
ond—place finisher in thel-meter div-
ing event, while teammate Moreen
O’Brien- finished in fourth place.

Sophomore Lacey‘ Hlavka was

one of four Pitt swimmers to finish in
the top seven in the 400 IM. Hlavka’s
time of 4:33.93 was good for second,
while‘ Karen Thibodeau, Kristina
DeWitt and Maryann Spindler fin-
ished in fifth, sixth and seventh,
respectively.
. “Our freshmen are exciting to
watch, and they make my job a little
Cassidy Keen said.
“Sometimes, we have to stop and rec-
ognize what we have.”

The Panthers lost to .both the
Wolfpack and the Scarlet Knights on
Saturday. North Carolina State topped
Pitt, 133-110, and Rutgers won, 138-
105.

Jen O’Brien won the 1-meter div-
ing event with a score of 255.85, more

than 14 points better than second-
place finisher Erin Bailey of North
Carolina State.

Other top finishers included
Hunter and sophomore Lindsay
Weaverling in the 50’ freestyle with
times of 24.20 and 24.74, respective-
ly.

Freshman Jaymie Van Kooten was
a second-place finisher in the 200 but-
terﬂy, just 0.28 seconds behind Mary
Mittendorf of the Wolfpack.

“Jaymie is racing at her career-
best. times in the 200 ﬂy, so I have to
be pleased with her,” Cassidy Keen
said.,

The Panthers are now 3-4 on the
season and 1-1 in the Big East.

Both the men’s and women’s
teams will host Virginia on Saturday
at Trees Pool.

there.

“They had me sitting out a lot
when I [switched for the second time].
I watched the outside players and I
think I learned a lot from watching
them,” Renick said. “Seeing how they
moved to the ball, it’s completely dif-
ferent.” .

The 2000 Panthers volleyball
team underwent a coaching staff
change over the summer and Renick,
Marcia Thiesen, Jennifer Nickels and
Lisa Riggle became the returning
seniors set to play for new head coach
Chris Beerman.

“He is a very good coach, proba-
bly the best coach I have ever had,”
Renick said. .

At the beginning of this season,
Beerman switched her over to the out-
side again.

“I just wanted a position to play
and [Alvear] wouldn’t give it to me,”
Renick said. “Now I have a little more
confidence because I’m not getting
switched around.”

She claims that her confidence has
jumped greatly since the start of the
season and has thrived throughout the
year from playing the same starting
position consistently.

Beerman values all of the player’s
contributions, but singles out Renick
as a big reason for the success of the
Panthers this season.

“The outside hitter right next to
the setter is literally your big gun,”
Beerman explained of the switch.
“You try to get your best athlete in

that position.”

In practicing with the new coach
this year, Renick feels that everyone
has begun to push each other more.
Thiesen and Renick motivate each
other and the players in other posi-
tions as well.

Despite the fact that this is her last
chance to get to the Big East tourna-

ment, Renick feels that there is little 0

pressure and just continues to have
fun. ' p
“I have definitely had a career
season this year,” Renick said. ,
Renick‘ has had numerous double-
double performances, set the Panthers
record for attempts with 90 against
Boston College and also was ranked
as high as second in the Big East in
kills.
0 Thiesen, who plays the other out-

side hitter position, feels that as a
senior, Renick has taken responsibili-
ty for leading the team and working to
make it_ a good ‘last season.

“We have the most responsibility
and we’re both on the same page,”
Thiesen said. . ‘

As far as Renick’s transitions
between middle and outside hitter,
Thiesen has seen her develop over the
past four years without a lot of coach-
ing. But she feels that Beerman really
helped when he switched her over to
outside for the entire 2000 season.

After the tournament, Renick will
continue to study toward a civil engi-
neering degree. She also looks for-
ward to healing the aches and pains
that have built up over the season.

“It’s a long season, so we tend to '

get beat up by the end.”

said. “They played very aggressive
and ‘attacked throughout the match.
They didn’t make many mistakes and

hit a pretty good percentage of their ~

first serves in, which is a winning for-
mula most of the time.”

Dieffenbach said that he didn’t
think Williams and Jafarian’s inexpe-
rience as a team had anything. to do
with the loss. '

“They practiced hard and played.
well together in the week they were
with each other,” Dieffenbach said.
“They play well together.”

Williams and Borza are two of the
younger players on the team, and '
Dieffenbach said that he was happy to
bring them on the trip to help them get
a glimpse at some of the country’s top
players.

“Younger players go to an event
like that and they can really see how
strong the competition is in the East,”
Dieffenbach ‘said.

The tournament wrapped up the
fall season, in which the Panthers
compiled a record of 3-1. Dieffenbach
was very happy with the play of the
team in the fall, especially because of
two victories in particular. ‘

Pitt defeated both Duquesne‘ and
in the fall. Duquesne defeated the
Panthers twice last season and Pitt had
been winless against Bloomsburg in
five previous meetings. 0

“Those two matches show that we
have improved, progressed and gotten-

_ stronger,” Dieffenbach said.

Overall, the coach feels that the
team has a lot of momentum heading
into the spring campaign.

“It was an excellent fall season,”
Dieffenbach said. “We had a good
tournament to set up our lineup. We
competed hard and got a 3-1 record.”

The Panthers will not compete
again until a home match against the
University of Missouri on Jan. 27 at
10 a.m.
