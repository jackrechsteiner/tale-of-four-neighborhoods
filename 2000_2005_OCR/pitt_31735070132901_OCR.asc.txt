This week, in an isolated stretch of the
Gobi Desert in northwestern China, a rock-

the Chinese equivalent of an astronaut —
into space. The successful launch made
China the third country, after Russia and the
United States, to accomplish such a feat. -

The Chinese-rnade Long March . 2F
rocket, carrying the Shenzhou V spacecraft,

9 a.m. on Oct. 15 at the site of the launch —_

Beijing. The craft carriedone taikonaut, air

One of the biggest mysteries had been the exact date and time

A of takeoff. The govemment’s latest statements put the launch date

between October 15 and 17, but it would not specify whether it
would be during the day or at night, when the other four Shenzhou-
class launches took place.

The identity of the ﬁrst taikonaut was not expected to be
revealed until the last minute, much like the situation surrounding

Feagin urges anti—racism

MIKE MASLANIK -
Staff Writer

By the year 2030, the majority of
children 18 and under will be non—white,
and by the year 2050, the majority of
Americans will be non-white.

Those are the ﬁndings of University
of Florida graduate research professor
Dr. Joe Feagin. Feagin talked to a packed

William Pitt Union Ballroom last‘

Monday about the upcoming “browning
of America” and how the historically
white power structure will deal with it.

“Either whites can accept that, or
there will be a lot of conﬂict,” Feagin
said.

Feagin, author or co-author of more
than 40 books dealing with racism, ‘for-
mulated his theories from more than 500
ﬁeld interviews that go back to 1988. He
found that there are two ways white
America can respond to these demo-
graphic shifts: white people can either
resist changes and face backlash, or they
can accept the changes and work to build
a “democratic, multi-racial society.”

“In many white minds, there is an
exaggerated fear of what the browning
of America is,” he said.

Feagin cited a recent Los Angeles
survey that found six out of 10 black
people experienced workplace discrimi-
nation. The rate of discrimination

increased with the level of education.
Findings were similar with Asians and
Latin Americans.

Negative attitudes toward immigra-
tion also fuel resentment, Feagin said.
VV1thout the mostly black and Latino
immigrant populations of New York
City and Chicago, those cities would be
deserted, he said. He argued that immi-
grants who come to large cities are vital
to the economy.

Feagin referred to predominately
white, gated communities, militia
groups, and anti-imrnigration books by
talk show host Pat Buchanan and Forbes
editor Peter Brimelow as counterproduc-
tive. -

“This is all about social justice,” he
said, “This is all about building a multi-
racial democratic society.”

Feagin argued that Americans of all
races must prepare for the upcoming
demographic shift.

Diversity training and anti—racism

education are necessary if the United,

States is to remain a powerful and pro-
ductive nation.

“The school that makes a serious
effort [at anti—racism education] will be
put on the map,” he said.

Feagin is a past president of the
American Sociological Association and
one of his books, “Ghetto Revolt,” was
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

Technology helps Schenley 

ISRAEL GUZMAN
Staff Writer

Deep inside the kitchen at Schenley
Cafe, past stacks of Dole and Fruit
Works juices, lies a machine that looks
more like a Star Trek instrument than a
detector of cleanliness. _

This detector lent a helping hand to
Schenley Cafe’s presentation, making
them big winners in Allegheny County
Health Department’s 12th Annual
Excellence in Food Protection Awards.
Schenley Cafe won, not only because of
the detector, but also because of its
strict rules regarding the handling of
food by workers and management.

Out of 27 ﬁnalists, only 10 came
back with a plaque of excellence.

“This may be the ﬁrst time a facili-
ty on a college campus has been recog-
nized for the award,” said Guillermo
Cole Jr., spokesman for the Allegheny
County Health Department over the
telephone.

“All the home cooked meals are
prepared in this section of the kitchen,”
said Dan Policce, a unit manager at
Schenley Cafe, walking alongside
Abdou Cole, Sodexho’s Food Services
Director through a busy Schenley
kitchen.

They credited teamwork from staff,
as well as procedures and systems con-

trolling food handling, for their award.

“This is a hand—washing detection
machine,” Cole said, pointing to a shin-
ing silver machine that looks like _an
upside down hand dryer, which shoots
ﬂuorescent light through a circular win-
dow. 1

“I don’t know if there is anybody-
around here who uses it in Allegheny
County. This is real new, brand new
technology,” Cole said of the device. '

Cole demonstrated how the

- machine would test cleanliness.‘

“Dan, as a manager, will pick an
employee, and he’ll bring him over
here, and what you have to do is put this
on your hand.” Cole soaped up his
hands, then washed them with water.

Cole then put his hands palms up
inside the detector, which revealed
spots of color on his hands.

“See, my hands are dirty. That’s
what the ﬂuorescent shows,” he
explained. “If_ it shows spots, my hands
are not clean.” .

Cole added that, were he working
at the time, he would have to wash his
hands again.

Cole_ said the machine, which costs
a few hundred dollars, is safe for hands.

“What we have found in our ‘indus-
try is most food—bome illnesses, where

Mono—Hodgkin’s link suspected

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

According to Dr. Kenneth Foon,
co-director of the Leukemia and
Lymphoma Program for Pitt’s
Cancer Institute, who was not
involved in the study, mono-suffer-
ers should not be panicked by the

As if suffering from a bout of
mono" wasn’t bad enough.
According to a recently con-

ducted study coming out ‘of - results of the study.
Denmark, people who contract “Having infectious mononucle-
infectious mononucleosis have osis does not mean you will defi-

more than two times the risk of
developing Hodgkin’s Disease, a
treatable-cancer of the lymph sys-
tem, compared to those who don’t
get the virus.

The study, published in the Oct.
2 issue of The New England Journal
of M’edici'ne,' was an effort--on the
part of several health groups and
agencies inDenmark and Sweden
involving more than 62,000 Danish
and Swedish people.

According to the National
Cancer Institute, the ‘disease makes
up less than 1 percent of all cancers
contracted annually.

Those in the study with the
“mono” virus, though, were found
to contract the rare cancer at a rate
of l in 1,000.

The study looked at patients’
risks for developing Hodgkin’s
lymphoma during the two decades

nitely get Hodgkin’s lymphoma,”
Foon said. “What this study has
done, through historical research
data, is prove one link that’s been
suspected for awhile.”

One factor in convincing study
researchers of the connection
between the two was the discovery
that of those in the examined group
who had developed Hodgkin’s lym-

cent, contained the Epstein-Barr
virus.

The Epstein-Barr virus is an
exceedingly common virus spread
through saliva through acts like
kissing. While relatively‘ harmless
to children, it can cause infectious
mononucleosis in those of puberty
age or older, with symptoms of
fever, extreme fatigue and swollen
glands.

a large zone in Irmer Mongolia, a sparsely
populated region of northern China.

On the verge of China’s ﬁrst manned
space ﬂight mission, NASA remains in the
grips of an estimated 18-month shuttle mis-
sion delay, sparked by last -February’s
Columbia shuttle crash.

The current situation for the two coun-
tries is similar to one that existed in 1986.
That year, following the Challenger explo-

sion, the United States announced a sus- '

pension of shuttle ﬂights while China
announced it would begin sending up com-
mercial satellites.

China launched its ﬁrst satellite in
1970. Propelled into orbit by a reﬁtted bal-
listic missile, the small satellite transmitted
the song ‘The East is R ” for a little under
a month. A

After an ambitious period of growth in
the 1980s, the initiative — dubbed Project
921 —- tolaunch a manned Chinese space
program was approved by Chinese govem—
ment leadership in 1992.

On Nov. 20, 1999, China sent up the
first of its Shenzhou missions, carrying
plants and animals, but not humans, into
space to test performance and life-support
systems.

On Tuesday, 9 October 14, China’s ‘

live television coverage of the event. Some
have speculated this is a precaution after a
failed 1995 Long March-class rocket
launch, which crashed soon after takeoff
and killed six people on the ground. The
crash was broadcast live to a television
audience, and some suspect that it hurt per-
ceptions of the program.

Many pundits see it as a self—conscious
demonstration of China’s technological
prestige, as well as -a legitimizing factor for
the incoming “fourth generation” adminis-
tration led by new President Hu Jintao and
new Premier Wen Jiabao.

The Chinese government heavily pro-
moted the mission, with unprecedented
state media coverage and a television doc-
umentary on the space program’s history
that will, according to Xinhua, begin airing
on state—rI1n television next Monday.
Ofﬁcials have planned to launch more rnis—
sions, including a possible space station
and several unmanned probes to orbit the
moon, within ﬁve years.

There has been speculation that
China’s increased space efforts will have
military implications, including increased
spying and intelligence capabilities in
efforts against Taiwan.

Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang
Qiyue last week said that China would not
engage in a space “arms race,” according to

adult years.

Bar, club talk tough for some

leave their e—mail addresses, which
allows them to be members for the
remainder of the membership drive.

Pitt professor Newell, who
developed the idea for Mywitz, said
the idea came to him when he asked
himself what there was to do
between classes. -

To Newell, the library is a good,
quiet place to read a book. The com-
puter lab is a good place to check
one’s e-mail. The coffee shop and
bar are places to drink a beverage,
but to Newell, none of those places
could guarantee an environment in
which students could strike up a con-
versation and receive a warm
response. _ .

“In a coffee shop, one has‘an
obligation to buy a cup of coffee,”
said Newell. At Mywitz, he added,
the only obligation is to interact with

others. Newell, who spent time in.

Syria with his wife Leila, said that
people in cultures abroad View life
differently than people do in the
United States. —

“We spent a lot of time in Syria.
Their lifestyle is different,” he said.
“It wasn’t one based on electricity,

‘but instead on hospitality.”

Newell recalled a street vendor
in Syria who invited him in for a cup
of coffee so that the street vendor
could practice his English with a uni-
versity professor. Newell said that if
the vendor had been someone who
knew him well in Syria, the ritual for
inviting him in would‘ have been
much more complex and elaborate —
all for the simple pleasure of a cup of
coffee.

“American culture has developed
a lot of energy in blocking people
out,” he said. “At a bar, it’s so loud,
how do you even say hi?”

“A concert, you can feel it, but
it’s not a community experience. In
traffic, you’re in cars surrounded by
1,000 other cars, but everyone’s hav-
ing a private experience,” he said of
human contact and interaction.

' As the founder of Mywitz,
N ewell also has to pay the bills. Rent
costs $2,200 a month, plus utilities,
he said, adding that he hopes stu-
dents and non—students alike will
take tours and sign up as members.

“It’s paid 100 percent by mem-

voulz

bership dues. It’s not for profit,”
Newell said. He added that he
received an offer to teach a few
classes this semester, but that he
turned them down to concentrate on
Mywitz.

Newell said he sees Mywtiz as a
space where foreign students can
master their English, while learning
things they don’t learn in class, like

slang, technical jargon and regional

dialects.
In return, these students can
share their experiences and perspec-

tives with those who might have

never ventured beyond Pittsburgh’s
city limits or traveled in an airplane.

Janet Zhao, who is from China,
said she enjoyed Mywitz’s atmos-
phere more than that of a bar.

“Bars are too loud,” she
explained.

“You can see this is not possible
in a bar,” said Jose Anchorena, a stu-

dent at CMU who is originally from

Argentina.
“No smoke,” Lihua Zhang added.
Dyala Aboud, ‘a Pitt student

I studying pre—dentistry, said students

should visit Mywitz because, “It’s a
new kind ‘of place. There hasn’t been
anything like this in Pittsburgh yet.”

To Aboud, the membership’ fees
are a bargain. _

“It’s a very comfortable environ-
ment to be in. It has a gfeat view, and
[it’s] a cheap place to hang out at,”
he said. “You meet new people of
diverse backgrounds and just have
somewhere to practice your speaking
skills. The prices are very cheap,
there’s cookies, cakes, and coffee
and tea present, where can you spend
less than a dollar each day of the
month.” I I 1 ;

When interviewed Tuesday, Dr.
Newell said they would close early
on Friday. He added, though, that
Fridays might have a happy hour. A

suggestion box has been added for ,

ideas, and the free membership trial
has been extended for another week.
The more potential members who
sign up, the lower the membership
rates will be, Newell explained. I

For Dr. Newell, this is important
because soon enough, the rent "will
be due. Hours for the upcoming
week will be from noon to 8 pm.‘

said, explaining why the device is
important for food safety.

In an industry where one sick cus-
tomer can end a restaurant’s life, hand
washing and food handling are of ‘high
importance to managers like Cole and
Policce.

“Even when the Health Department

comes in to do an inspection, that’s one
thing they look for, in terms of obser-
vation '—— to see employees washing
their hands,” Cole said; ‘

The managers also showed their '_

time logs, where temperatures are
recorded for all their foods. Managers
and employees’ use thermometers to
make sure cold food is always under 40
degrees, and hot food is always over
140 degrees. A

The awards were given at a recep-
tion at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto in

Hodgkin’s affects mostly young adults

Mono, page 3

mononucleosis leads to a higher
rate of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and
say it is by no means the only cause
of the cancer.

Hodgkin’s lymphoma affects

the body’s lymph system, a part of

the body’s immune system.
According to the UPCI.Web site,
the lymph system is made up of thin
tubes that branch, like blood ves-
sels, into all parts of the body.
Lymph vessels carry a colorless,
watery fluid containing white blood
cells called lymph. Along the net-
work of vessels are groups of

organs called lymph nodes. Clusters
of lymph nodes are found in the
underarm, pelvis, neck and
‘abdomen.

, The lymph nodes make and
store infection—fighting cells and
are generally where signs of the
cancer are fist seen.

According to UPCI, Hodgkin’s
lymphoma most commonly affects
young adults and those older than
55, although there are childhood
occurrences of the cancer.

Signs of the disease include
swelling of the lymph nodes, fever,
fatigue and weight loss without
dieting.

Severe obesity rate grows enormously

So the United States is getting fat-
ter. Well, not the country; our borders
are still slim and trim as ever.

We, as a people, are fatter than we
were a mere 17 years ago.

Santa Monica, Ca., researchers
found that the number of people who
qualified as severely obese —— having
a body mass index of 50or greater —
went from 1 in 200 people in 1986 to
1 in 50 in 2000. That’s four times the
number of severely obese people in
the time it took the Olsen twins to go
from squashy—faced babies to twin
empresses.

BMI is a measure of height to
weight ratio, and, while useful, is not
entirely accurate. It fails to take into
account differences in body-frame —
some people really are big-boned —
and muscle mass. '

But a BMI above 50 indicates
something beyond simple fuzzy cal-
culations or needing to lose 5, or even
50, extra pounds. Severely obese peo-
ple tend to be «more than 100 pounds
overweight. A 5-foot 10-inch, 373-
pound man, for instance, would quali-
fy as such.

According to an ‘Oct. 14 article in
The Washington Post, severely obese
people are at risk for any number of
chronic illnesses, including arthritis
and diabetes.

What’s more, because these ill-
nesses are chronic, rising numbers of

severely obese people will lead to ris-
ing health care costs.

Moreover, current health care cost
estimates are probably‘ underesti-

mates. Before this study, the severely _

obese were not counted, since they‘
were considered outliers.

But because the severely obese
now comprise about 2 percent of the
population, they can no longer be con-
sidered as such. I

It’s no surprise that Americans are
fat and getting fatter. We’re a nation
of cheese—covered, chicken—fried
steak and deep—fried candy bars,
where the norm is extra large, not
medium, and size really, really mat-
ters.

We’re under lots of stress and
cope by eating fattening — rather than
healthy, — foods, a Sept. 10 article in
the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

In a sense, We’re overfed and
undernourished, and that leads to big-
ger waistlines and even more stress.

This is _a national problem —- we
have a fat culture, one that’s passed
from generation to generation.

Indeed, analysis of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health showed that fat teens tend to
be fat adults.~ _

So it seems we are facing two
options — make obese people get
healthy, or pay for it in the long run.

A typical day in the life of two lazyguys 1?

«As columnists for The Pitt News, 1 9:15. Breakfast: grits, fatback '

we get manyrcurious inquiries about
our craft, ranging from “Just how big
of a penis does it take to be a colum-
nist?” to “What are you guys going _to
wear to The Source Awards?” This
week, we have decided to answer one
of the most common questions: “Are
you two dudes gay or what?” The
answer is “No -—— not that there’s any-
thing wrong with that.” Seeing as
how that took up no space, we will
answer a second 1 question: “Good
sirs, allowing that you are v
models of perfect colle-
giate behavior, what is
your typical day like, so
that I can change my life '
to _become more like ?

Every day, it gets harder and harder for
the male marijuana enthusiast to reproduce.

First, there was the whole thing about
having to go ﬁnd a mate. Kind of a hassle
there, since it means leaving the house and
speaking coherently enough to seduce a
woman. Better to stay put, pondering the
possibilities of asexual reproduction, like
how amoebas do it, or a service that would
just let you rent a baby.

Even if you do manage to woo a
woman with the offer of a quick boink,
researchers at the State University of New
York in Buffalo say sperm from heavy mar-
ijuana smokers regularly fails to reach the
egg, making conception impossible. Most
people would chalk this up to laziness or a
lack of direction on the sperm’s part.

But because they are scientists, the
Buffalo researchers looked beyond such
easy answers.

They found that — in much the same
way marijuana users often have bursts of
energy, talking about “Hey, let’s put on a
Broadway show,” only to collapse listless
on the couch ﬁve seconds later — the mari-
juana sperm start too quickly and ﬁnd them-
selves burnt out. Instead of pushing on to the
egg, they break for Cheetos and to debate
the greatness of “Apocalypse Now.”

No, wait, those are Film Studies sperm.
The marijuana sperm argue about “Waking
Life.” And whether or not I could, hypo-
thetically, vibrate my body at the perfect fre-
quency and pass right through this bong.

But that’s another column.

The study reminds me of that old anti-
drug commercial in which this guy is sitting
around in his basement, watching TV or
otherwise wasting his life away. He’s prob-
ably mid-30s.

Then there’s a voice-over along the
lines of, ‘My uncle smoked
weed all the time and nothing
ever happened to him.” The
camera zooms in on the griz-
zled old pothead, ominous
music. swells: nothing ever
happened to him.

They should bring back
that commercial, but with one
additional line, “This man is
your sperm.” Unfortunately, I

Standingup for my right to piss like a man,with,out a trough

The male ability to pee standing up
deﬁnitely has its advantages, both in the
realms of convenience and efficiency. The
latter of those two put me in an awkward
position last Saturday at Heinz Field.

If you were not on hand to witness the
Panther’s humiliating defeat, then you were
also not around to experience the debacles
that took place inside the lavatories.

While I have been at Heinz Field many
times before, I had never been there under

such populated and intoxicated conditions. ,
It was then that my upright—urinating self '

was forced to reconcile with the demons
surrounding “the trough.”

For those of you either crafted without
a penis or just scared of large, athletic-cen-
ter bathroom facilities, “the trough” is an
unknown monster. “The trough” is quite a
trough that wraps itself around the men’s
room wall with the intention of ﬁtting as
many male units in front of it as possible.
Designed to be the ultimate model of uri-
nary efficiency, the trough does make for
speedy evacuation rituals. But on Saturday,
I would have gladly sacriﬁced a few more
seconds to keep my privacy and my digni-
ty intact.

The conditions were chaotic. Halftime
produced its usual mass exodus of fans
from their seats to their sexually designated

restrooms. The men’s room, in turn,
became full of males with engorged blad-
ders, all muscling their way for a few inch-
es in which to insert their reproductive
organ and make with the pissing. It was a
pure, animalistic, every-man-for-himself
wizz—a—palooza.

And there I was, smashed in the center
of it, struggling to keep my bal-
ance, aim and’ tiny shred of
decency. Of the some million
times I’ve gone to the bathroom
in my life, this was the least
pleasant.

Since the invention of the
trough, public restrooms have
become a bit too public. As a
man, having the ability to evac-
uate body waste in a timely
manner, I’m all for a facility
that allows us to do so. A quick
look» over to the women’s side of things
always conﬁrms this.

But the trough is just plain wrong.
Imagine the next time you have ten or so
guests over your residence for a party and
the time comes for them to relieve them-
selves and so, to maximize eﬁciency, you
ask them to stand around your bathtub and
just let ﬂy. You’d probably, at the least, not
be asked to host again.

 

David J. McCarthy

Columnist

But this is exactly what the builders of
athletic stadiums ask us to'do on a regular
basis. Is the return of urinals too much to
ask for?_ Urinals do not allow for insane,
penis—char‘ging free-for-alls and provide the
necessary four inches of ceramic privacy.
Efficiency is only slightly reduced.
Granted, the stalls are still provided in all

* facilities, but as any female
will tell you, they are land-
marks of inefﬁciency. '
You may ask yourself,
_“Why wasthe trough created
in the  place?” I’ll tell
you why: to avoid the notori-
ous “gang piss.” The gang
piss is rare, but still docu-
mented._I was on hand to
witness such an event senior
year of high school.

. j “ After a long evening of

drinking, my crew ‘headed to a near-by all-

night diner. Immediately entering the

men’s room, my mates came to the quick A

decision that there was not enough desig-
nated urination destinations and that irnpro—
visation must take place to avoid any fur-
ther delay. The following things were used:
urinal, toilet, sink, garbage can, wall, paper
towel dispenser, door. While you might
think this was an isolated incident, I have

witnessed similar actions at sporting events
throughout my lifetime.

The efforts to avoid the gang piss are
noble, but the trough is demeaning. If efﬁ—
ciency is one’s only goal in designing a
public facility, why not go beyond even the
trough? Why not just place a large storm
drain in the middle of the ﬂoor and let
everyone gather around in a massive circle
and piss all over the place? Better yet, why
not just hand out buckets and let fans just

- go in their seats? Clearly, the engineers‘

were not concerned with privacy and dig-
nity. .

Such situations should not arise. The
fate of American dignity is at stake here. I
ask that the distasteful trend of the trough

.discontinue and the old ways of the urinal

be resunected.

Sort of like what would happen if the
Catholic Church were put in charge of
bathroom construction, only with less
molestation and sexism. ‘ V _

Well, I guess with current bathroom
conditions the way they are, only slightly
less molestation and sexism.

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A&E Editor

In the hands of just any director,
“Mystic River” would be exactly
what it should be — a typical, B-
grade genre picture. ,

But Clint Eastwood isn’t just an
director. . « » ‘J

Eastwood’s latest effort tran-’

scends the crime film genre and
becomes something else entirely —
an exploration of the genre, from the
inside out.

It doesn’t look this way at first
glance. You’ve got the main charac-
ters, who would seem decent enough
if not for one shared event in their
past that changed their lives forever.
Here, it’s Jimmy, Dave and Sean
(Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin
Bacon, respectively), three guys who
grew up together in a rough Boston
neighborhood. One afternoon, Dave is
abducted by a couple of cop imper-
sonators and molested for four days
before escaping his captors.

Then there is the present-day
tragedy that brings the three long-
since—parted
friends back
together. In
this case,
J i m m y ’ s
daughter is .
brutally mur-.

dered. Sean,
now a
Massachusetts

state detective
is called in on
the case. And
Dave is look-

ing like a
prime suspect.
He comes

home the night

armed with a

cataract!-nun;

plus he’s a bit unstable thanks .to
the abduction and molestation he
endured as a kid.

Finally, there’s the third act of
this played—all-too-often tragedy —
the betrayal-revenge portion where
everything is set right until it’s
revealed that things have only been
made worse. .

A This story’s been played a
thousand times before, from the
days of Shakespeare to the gang-
ster days of the 1930s to the pre-
sent day. It’s only fitting that an old
Warner Brothers logo opens the ‘
film 4 Warner «Bros.,is the studio" Q

But not so fast —.—}E,astwood 
has -something else in mind than 4;}
telling the same old story.“ ,  

With “Mystic River,” he does "
for the crime film What he did for
the Western in “Unforgiven” — he
explores a tired genre, its insides,
who populates these films, why they
do what they do and what the cost of
their actions is.

Jimmy, Dave and Sean are neither
heroes nor villains. All three have
their faults, some worse than others,

but they don’t make the characters i
any better or worse — at least on their .

own. It takes a couple nudges from
fate. .

Jimmy, for example, did time in
jail, among other, «worse things. But
that doesn’t stop us from caring for
him when he’s reeling after the death

;.uuKlilll~

of his daughter, or from hating him
when he decides to take the law into
his own hands. Similarly, Dave comes
across as a bit of‘a weirdo, but we feel
for him, at least initially —- it’s only
after-the insinuation and innuendo do
We start to question who this guy is.
Eastwood handled the - characters in
“Unforgiven”- in the same way. .
Penn and Robbins are called on to

do the emotional heavy lifting, and,

boy, are they up tothe task. Penn has
never been better. The scene between
Jimmy and Dave near the end of the

lay “Mystic” e

    
  

\.

film is wrenching and allows Penn to
show off his range. And Robbins is

amazing in playing against type as a
big, aloof, wide-eyed child of a man. ‘

Dave needs to be menacing and sym-

_ pathetic simultaneously and Robbins

nails it.- . —

— Through these characters, -the
cyclical nature of crime —'—~ how, once
it affects one generation, it inevitably
affects , future generations — is
explored by Eastwood in moments

like the beautifully constructed final

parade scene, which is too good to
spoil.

Eastwood did the same
exploration of the violence of
the Western in “Unforgiven.”
Heconcludes, in that film, that

violence, comes to an end
-through violence perpetrated
by‘ people who want to live
without it? -But the person —
William Munny in this case .—

stop the violence. Theending is

film — a tale of people stuck in

made worse by hopeless human
beings.
“Mystic River” is a beauti-
ful, mesmerizing film that stays

Dando rocks Rosebud

Before now, I don’t think I’ve
ever used, or heard anyone else use,
Evan Dando’s name in the same sen-
tence as Vic Chesnutt’s. The two
singer—songwriters hail from very dif-
ferent musical backgrounds —
Dando is the former ringleader of
grunge-era band The Lemonheads,
and Chesnutt is one of the most cele-
brated Southern—folk songwriters of
the past 15 years.

After disappearing from the pub-
lic eye for a number of years, during
which he wrestled with a drug prob-
lem, Dando returned with a live
album in 2001, in which he played
through much of the Lemonheads’
catalog. This spring, he returned with
Baby I’m Bored, a well—received
album that found Dando collaborat-
ing with Ben Lee, Jon Brion, and
Spacehog’s Bryce Goggin.

Chesnutt, whose musical craft is
as revered as his ability to construct
enthralling lyrical narratives, is also

touring in support of a new album,

Silver Lake, his ninth full—length to
date. The musician first rose to popu-

‘wlarity in the late ‘80s, when he

became acquainted with Michael
Stipe, who ended up producing
Chesnutt’s first two records. But it
wasn’t until 1996, when artists like
Madonna, Smashing Pumpkins, and

R.E.M. covered his songs for a bene-
fit album, that Chesnutt became a
bona fide star. In fact, taking into
account Chesnutt’s widespread
recognition, one might wonder why
he isn’t the one headlining his tour
with Dando.

Inasmuch as these two musicians
differ in their stylistic leanings, the
similarities they share are compelling
in their own way. For one, they hap-
pen to have both taken small roles in
mid—‘90s Hollywood blockbuster
films, with Dando having appeared in
“Reality Bites,” and Chesnutt in
“Sling Blade.” Both musicians, too,
have reverted to releasing albums on
fairly unknown labels after flirting
with the majors for a few years.

Still, they remain in sharp con-
trast with one another: Dando is a
heartthrob with a penchant for jangle
pop and Chesnutt a paraplegic south-
ern folk star. At the very least, this
show will offer an interesting musical
mix and is sure to draw as eclectic a
crowd.

Evan Dando and Vic Chesnutt will
play at Rosebud in the Strip District
on Oct. 15 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $25-
$28. For more information, call
(412) 261-2232.

How not to stay in bed  

Two Point Perspective
Life in Bed

72:71‘: e
Recommended if you like:
Admiral Twin and Phish

Visions of plain, white sheets and a
breeze blowing white curtains into your
room make the idea of spending your life in
bed a pretty romantic one. Though, as a col-
lege student, spending your life in bed seems
like a great idea because of the pure exhaus-
tion college causes. But being conﬁned to a
bed, realistically, would be pretty tenible.
Life in Bed’s album Two Point Perspective
is somewhere in between the romantic
imagery, pure exhaustion and torture.

Almost every song on Two Point
Perspective starts off sounding like chill rock
with a breezy, .mellow quality.
Unfortunately, a dissonant guitar adds itself
to many of the songs, changing the whole
vibe of the song and exhausting your
eardrurns. On the song “Gun,” the guitar
doesn’t mesh well with the song and takes
away from the overall experience. The best
part of the song is the lyrics, something com-
mon to many of Life in Bed’s songs. A par-
ticularly poignant lyric in “Gun” is “Lie ﬁrst.
It’s a graceful crime.” The lyrics in Two
Point Perspective make you think about
things from a different perspective, hence the

album’s title.

The band also shows that itlhas some
Pittsburgh in them when they sing “Dying to
live there home enough great for yinz too
loud for ban ” on the song “Weight of an
Atom.” The guitar in . the song is again
painfully repetitive and distracting from the
lyrics. The background instrumentals sound --
like pure chaos. The best part of the song is .
adecentdrumbreakthatbuildsto acrescen-
do. By the end of the song, the guitar calms
down a bit and ﬁnishes outon a pretty mel_- >
low tip. The lyrics ir1 “Weight of an Atom”
are interesting. A few choice lyrics are ‘5It, -
happened again wrong, wrong way out.
Unstoppable in dreams, I am unstoppable in "
my life in 

On Two Point Perspective, ﬂ'1e musi-
cianship is lacking and not up to par with the
lyrics themselves. Really, Life in Bed just
needs to chill out a little bit and stop playing
their guitar and other instruments so urgent-

ly.

Life in Bed will play an all—ages CD release
show on Fri., Oct. 17 at 8 p.m at the
ModemFormations Gallery, located at 4919
Penn Ave. They will be performing with The
Wynkataug Monks and Arrivals and
Departures. For more information, call

Everybody Loves a Winner
Jeff Klein

One Little Indian Records

7i‘r7.“r7L‘r ’
Recommended if you like: Tom
Waits, Bruce Springsteen,
Lucinda Williams ‘

On his beautiful,  lyrics-driven album
Everybody Loves a Winner, Jeff Klein tackles

subjects not unfamiliar to ordinary people —— '

hopes, dreams, love and loss. These may be

common themes in the world‘ of music, but -

Klein, with his scratchy voice and few instru-
ments, makes it his mission to evoke strong
emotions from every listener.

“I’m Sorry Sweet Emily” is an apology a
man makes for abandoning his lover when he
feels he can’t contribute anything more to
their relationship. He writes eloquently, say-
ing, “I’ve got a hunger as big as my eyes/And‘
a promise that I’ll never keep/I know I
shouldn’t be out here/Cause no one loves you
more than me/But I don’t think I’m coming
home tonight/I’m sony sweet Emily.”

“California” is Klein’s tongue—in—cheek
nod to the excess and glamour that pour forth
from Hollywood and Los Angeles. It begins
with a heavy electric guitar riff, a stark con-
trast to most of the other songs on the album,
which have quiet, unassuming openings, and

the lyrics open with “There’s a buzz hanging

Singer-songwriter Klein is a winner

over my head/From my broken neon
halo/Like a movie that I slept through/I just
don’t get the point.” Patty Griffin joins him
on the chorus, singing “But if I get to
California/Before I lose‘ my mind/I’ll lay my
burden on you/For one last time.”

Klein is a dead ringer for Bruce
Springsteen on “Another Breakdown,” a
song searching for meaning in a monotonous
life. He is examining the life he leads in lyrics
such as “And me, myself I’m arrogant/But
I’ll always admit it/Cause it’s*the one last
thing that I/Can hold onto anymore/And I’ve
been waiting patiently behind/Yeah another

breakdown/Yeah I wish they’d come put me I

away.” .

On the softly melodic “Five Good
Reasons,” Klein is trying to ﬁnd his own
voice in the world, expressing emotions typi-
cal of late adolescenceand early adulthood,
singing “I’ve got ﬁve good reasons why,I
never sleep at home/And I’ve got four more
people telling me I am wrong/And I’ve got

_ three more wishes, God I wish that I was

gone/I’Ve got two more fears left and I fear
that I am one.” . '

Jeff Klein is undoubtedly a very talented
singer and songwriter. Everybody Loves a
Vlﬁnner will envelop you in emotions and per-
haps force you to dig a little deeper when
contemplating the essential issues of love,
loss, hopes and dreams.

Get Born puts Jet into orbit

Getlfﬂorn .
Jet \
Elektra Records

» DOUG RUTSCH
The California Aggie (U. Califomia-Davis)

U-WIRE—Garage—rock,ha's a mantra
akin to that of a Navy SEAL -— get
in, rock hard and get out. There’s not
a lot of time to dawdle and reminisce
over atrocities committed in the past
'— things have to come loud and
come fast. . ' ~ -

Jet, the next group of greasy
rockers to come along the Elektra
records pipeline,-sways dangerously
far from this idea with its album Get
Born; Or, as it should be called, The
Album That Contains “Are You
Gonna Be My Girl,” the endlessly
catchy single that got ample radio
play. 5 J A

First off, a discussion of the sin-
gle. It’ has everything that makes
garage rock’ unceasingly accessible:
an addictive guitar line, simple yet
heavy drums that echo the vocals
and, of course, ' the voice of lead
singer Cam Muncey driving the song
with a tune that the most tone—deaf
fan can sing along with -— perhaps

even better than Muncey himself.

, The single isjdefinitely a fun
song, but it’s probably, superceded by
its bookends, intro “Last Chance”-
and track three, “Rollover DJ More

A than ‘,‘Are You Gonna Be My Girl,”

these tracks bring enjoyable energy

to the opening of Get Born.

Then, taking a word from Rob
Gordon in. “High Fidelity,” Jet makes
sure not to blow its load too early by
keeping the fourth song, ‘fLook What
You’ve, Done,” on the slow side.
Unfortunately, the band lacks the

technical ability to bring the song_

into the same level as the previous
tracks. , ' ’

After that, though, the momen-
tum of'the album is gone and Jet
never reaches its initial energy level.
Songs extend from three minutes to
four, and there simply isn’t enough
happening to warrant that extra
minute; There are a few brief high-
lights, like the soulful “Move On,”
and a possibly Stones-inspired “Take
It Or Leave It.” Jet’s'attempt to add a
more powerful r.ock tune is
admirable, and while it’s not bad, it’s
not great either. But the first three
tracks alone makethe album worth-
while.

4 Young scores twice in

Panthers’ overtime win

JACKIE HOTECK
Staff Writer

Keeyan Young scored two goals,
including the game winner, to help the

Pitt men’s soccer team defeat
Georgetown, 2-1, in double overtime
Sunday.

With the win, Pitt’s record

improves to 5-8-0 overall and 2-4-0 in
the Big East. The Hoyas dropped to 4-
7-2 overall and 1-5-0 in conference
play.

“[Georgetown] is competing with
us for a spot in tournaments. We’ve
struggled with them in the past, so it
was a big win,” head coach Joe
Luxbacher said.

Georgetown advanced early with
a goal in the eighth minute of play.
The Hoyas’ Ricky Schram ﬁnished a
corner kick from teammate Daniel
Grasso to give Georgetown the 1-0
lead.

Just 13 seconds later, Pitt evened
the score, when Young broke through
the Hoyas’ defense for his ﬁfth goal of
the season.

With the score even at one, the
Panthers’ defense came up big.

Steelers problems harder to fix than in past seasons

Think that the game of football
isn’t won and lostin the trenches?

Tell that to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Steelers are no strangers to
slow starts under Bill Cowher. In
1995, Pittsburgh started off 3-4 before
going on an eight-game winning streak
en route to a Super Bowl appearance.
And just last season, the Steelers stum-
bled out of the gates at 1,.-3, only to win

the AFC North division in the first.

year of its existence.
Usually, these losses can be attrib-

‘ uted to alack of rhythm, inability to

establish an offensive identity, minor
injuries, and the like. .
And inevitably, Cowher waves his

.magic bye-week wand, the team

makes‘ adjustments, .and like a, corpse
in J a Michael Jackson video, A the
Steelers ‘rise from the ashes to pummel
their inferior AFC foes week after
week'”‘on the road to postseason-con-
tender status. ‘

But if you think that history will
repeat itself ‘ for this season’s 2-4

. Steelers, you are sadly mistaken.

This year’s Steelers have a prob-
lem that runs deeper than minor
injuries or, an inability to gel early.
Pittsburgh has seriousepersonnel defi-
ciencies on its offensive line, and it is
too late in the season to correct them
with a motivational speech or a bye

week. ,
Thanks to the offseason exit of
offensive tackle Wayne Gandy, as well
as injuries to offensive tackles Marvel
Smith and Todd Fordham, the Steelers
have the most unstable "line in their

 

history under Bill Cowher. As a result,
despite still having some of the most
talented offensive skill players in the
AFC, Pittsburgh has been unable to
establish either a passing or running
game. " ‘
Tommy Maddox was sacked seven
times in Sunday’s loss to the Denver
Broncos. In that -game, the Steelers
used at least five different offensive
line combinations involving Alan
Faneca, Keydrick Vincent, Oliver
Ross, Jeff Hartings, Kendall Simmons,
Chukky Okobi and Mathias Nkwenti.
Hartings and Faneca played multiple
positions during the course of the
game, and as a result, the right side of

the Steelers’ offensive line was thinner
than Lara Flynn Boyle.

A lot of Steelers fans have been
down on Maddox the last few weeks,
and while his performances have been
less than spectacular, his hogs up front
deserve most of the blame. Maddox is
a pocket, three-step and release passer.
He is not - a scrambler like Kordell
Stewart,‘ and he tends to make dumb
decisions in lieu of taking a sack when
he is forced out of the pocket.

He has a quick release and he
throws to spots instead of receivers;
you’re not going to see a lot of pump-
fakes from the Tommy gun. Maddox
needs a solid offensive line to be suc-
cessful, something he had last season
when he replaced Stewart as the
starter.

Maddox has been sacked 20 times
this season, the most of any quarter-
back in the AFC, and no quarterback
can get comfortable under that kind of
pressure. When he’s not getting
sacked, his passes are getting batted
down by defensive linemen who are
pushing the Steelers’ front four off of
the_ball, and many of his eight inter-
ceptions this season have come while
he was on the run. .

When it comes to runningthe foot-
ball, the Steelers, who are traditionally
one of the league’s rushing power-

"llhe. ClZli3l<;  ;§)£;”1l“lil.i;.S 

houses, have been completely shut
down. They rank 27th in the league in
rushing offense, managing an abysmal
88.3 rushing yards per game. Jerome
Bettis used to average 88.3 yards per
game by himself, and the onus of
responsibility for this failure should
again be placed on the offensive line.

Whether Cowher or Bettis will
admit it, the main reason that Bettis
was benched at the beginning of the
season was not because of his inability
to start, but because Cowher knew that
the Steelers’ offensive line wouldn’t
be able to open up holes for him.

As a result, Cowher went with the
younger, shiftier Amos Zereoue to
compensate for the Steelers’ impend-
ing lack of a power-running game. The
only problem is that the offensive line
hasn’t opened any holes for Zereoue
either.

Both Zereoue and Bettis have been
dead where they stand nearly every
time they get the ball this season.
Neither guy has even had a chance to
make a cut or stick his head down
before he is swarmed upon by a defen-
sive lineman.

Zereoue, who has run mainly
sweeps, presumably so that he can cre-
ate some space for himself, has looked

Zimmer showed loyalty

Falcon, page 15,

The coach lunged at Martinez in
a notable fashion, but was quickly
halted when Martinez stepped aside
and nudged Zimmer to the ground.

While some blame Martinez for
triggering Saturday’s chaotic
events, others have questioned the
sanity of a very old coach in his bla-
tant efforts of assault. .

Personally, I think what hap-
pened was great. It’s baseball.

For starters, this series is
undoubtedly the biggest rivalry in
baseball and probably all of sports.
What Martinez d-id when he hit the
batter in the back is something that
happens in baseball on a daily
basis; .
While he may lack class, with
his loud mouth and cocky attitude,
hitting the opponent has been a part
of baseball since the game began
and it was bound to happen at some
point in the series. .

As for Zimmer, he is not the
crazed lunatic many have made him
out to be from this single confronta-
tion. I found what he did to be not
only humorous, but- adorable as
well.

Many may argue that Zimmer
had no right to react the way he did,
but why not? A

It is common courtesy to stick
up for your teammates and *-have
their back in the heat of battle in
any sport. It was clear that nobody

else was going to do it from the ‘

Yankees organization. In my opin-
ion, Zimmer was the only one on
the team with extreme passion to
win the game. He showed his loyal-

.ty to the Yankees and the heart of a

true competitor.

What Martinez did was distaste-
ful tothe Yankees, but the team did
nothing but argue. There should
have been 20 guys on the back of
Martinez, not a solo 72 year-old
man lyingon the ground on his own
back.I F . ’

Hats off to Zimmer for’ being a
man and taking one‘ for the team.

As forthe series, I think the
fights, the shouting matches, and
the tight competition between the
Yankees and the Red Sox are irre-
sistible, and represent. professional
sports‘ at their finest.

Clemens summed it up best at
the end of game 3 when he said
“Great theatre, whatever you want
to ‘call it. I think it’s great baseball.”

Ryan Faloon is a columnistfor The
Pitt News who chose to come to Pitt
over Morehead State because of its
outstanding intramural program.

Young eamsBig East honors

WIPS, page 15 I

Y0ung’s three goals earn Big East
honor ' ’

,- For the third time in his career,
Pitt sophomore forward Keeyan
Young has earned weekly « confer-
ence honors, having been named Big
East co-Offensive Player of -the
Week. Young scored‘ three goals in
two games — both Panther Victories
— against Bucknell A and
Georgetown.

Young’s career—high two goals ,.

accounted for all the Panther offense

T in a 2-1 double overtime win over

Georgetown. Young leads the
Panthers in scoring with six goals
and he also has one assist.

His 13 points match last year’s, I
‘ blocks with 16 in 2003, giving her

scoring output. Three of Young’s six
goals have been game winners and
two of the three game—winning goals
were the difference in both of Pitt’s
Big East Conference victories.

Young received conference. hon-
ors twice last season when he was
named Big ‘East Rookie o’f‘the Week
on both Sept. 9 and Oct. 7.

Miller named Big East C0-Player
of the Week for the third time in
career /

For the second straight week, a
Pitt volleyball player was named Big

East co-Player of the week. Last .

week it was Wendy Hatlestad, this
time it’s junior middle hitter Megan

‘Miller.

‘Miller helped the Panthers to
two victories this past weekend
against Connecticut and St. John’s.
Against UConn, Miller finished with
27 kills, just one shy of her career
best. ‘

On the season, Miller is one of
the top hitters in Division I at .408
with a total of 234 kills and just 38
errors in 480 attempts.

She also leads the team in Solo “

44 for her career, the 10th most in
Panthers history. ' A
The Panthers are unbeaten in Big

» East play at 5-0 and have won eight
straight conference matches dating

back to last year. They have also
won their last nine matches and 13
of 14 since a 2-2 start to the season.

like he is running for his life half of
the time,_ trying to find even the small-
est crease to squirt through. I would

say that Bettis, the power back, does— '

nft hit the hole as quickly as he used
to, except for the fact that there
haven’t been any holes for him to hit
this year. '

Preliminary reports suggest that
Smith will be back in the lineup for
the Oct. 26 game against St.‘ Louis,
and the Steelers have a bye week to
continue to shift their shaky line and
find the right combinations. But the

‘bottom line‘ is that the Steelers don’t

have the talent in the offensive trench-

es this season to protect their quarter-‘

back or establish ‘a running game. And
in an AFC North filled with good
defenses, that lack of talent is not
going to result in many Steelers’ vic-
tories.

Michael Cunningham is a columnist
for The Pitt News, and he is tired of
watching miserable line play on

Pittsburghis football teams.

back, going on a 6-2 run to pull within
in one point before Pitt called a time-

The Dukes tied the score at 26 after‘
the timeout, but Pitt regrouped and
went ahead, 29-27, before Duquesne
called a timeout.

“I- trust this team a lot,” Beerman

‘said. “This team has earned my trust;

they come through always composed,
and all I told them [during the timeout]
was ‘let’s settle down and take care of

. the ball a little better.’ We just wanted

to make Duquesne earn their points if
they were going to get them, and I
think we did that at the end.”

Duquesne: scored first after the
timeout, but Pitt was able to put the
game away, winning 30-28.

“[Duquesne] did all the things that
I would do against us,” Beerman said.
“We were just a little sporadic with the
ball tonight — too many errors giving
Duquesne points.”

The Panthers started ‘off the match
strong, jurnpingout to a 12-4 lead in
the first game before the Dukes called

held on for the 30-23 win.

In the second match, Pitt was able
to ﬁght its way to a 13-7 lead and held
on for a 30-23 win.

The 10-match winning streak is
Pitt’s longest since winning 11 in a row
during the middle of last season. The
Panthers now have 10 days off before
"returning to action, and Beerman plans
to give the team some time to rest.

“We’ve had quite a haul here,

when you count [the preseason trip to]
Europe,” he said. “It’s been a little bit
longer — season than most teams,
because we played eight matches in
Europe. We’re going to give [the play-
ers] a little rest and then come back
refreshed on Monday and head into
another Big East week.”

Pitt returns to the court on Oct. 24
when it resumes Big East play by host-
ing Seton Hall at Fitzgerald Field
House at 7 p.m.
