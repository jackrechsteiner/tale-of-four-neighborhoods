increase isn’t enough to make a difference

KATE GIAMMARISE
Staff Writer '

Bill Parrish is a Pitt sophomore
with blond hair and a wide smile.
He is also one of the 3,750 students
on Pitt’s campus who receive a fed-

eral Pell Grant as part of a financial '0

aid package to cover tuition costs.
“Without it, I’d haveto take-out

I more loans,” Parrish said.

Rodger Murphey, a spokesper-
son for the U.S. Department of
Education, said President Bush’s
proposed budget for next year
includes an increased amount of
funding for. the Pell Grant program.
’ But according to Suzanne
McColloch, an associate director in
Pitt’s office of admissions and
financial aid, her office is “not esti-
mating any significant increase” in
the number of students at Pitt who
receive Pell Grants, despite the pro-
gram’s proposedpincrease in fund-
ing. ' j ‘ '
The total amount of funding

allocated in the new federal budget
is $10.9 billion, a 5.3 percent
increase from last year.

“We estimate it will be a less
than 5 percent increase,”
McColloch said. ' ' ’

Murphey , also said the‘ Pell
Grant program is facing a funding
shortfall because of the country’s’
economic downturn.

“Mo-re students applied for Pell
Grants than we anticipated,”
Murphey said. » A I ,

Because of the shortfall, the
Department of, Education is
requesting an additional $1.3 bil-
lion in funding.’

According to Murphey, in the
next .fiscal year, nearly 4.5 million
students nationwide will receive

[Pell Grants. The average grant is

$2,409 and the maximum Pell Grant
pa student'can receive is $4,000. '

c‘ Murphey said the Pell Grant
program is the largest federal grant

program in the Department of

Education. ’

THE PITT NEWS

Dropping the usual sexual labels

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING ,
Staff Writer "

Mark Friedman has a question: How do
adolescents know they’re gay?

During a luncheon presentation sponsored
by the Center for Research on Health and
Sexual Orientation, Friedman, a doctoral candi-
date in Pitt’s Graduate School of Social Work,
outlined his pilot study examining that ques-
tion. - '
Friedman said the mission of his study was
not to find an answer to the question, but was
instead to find a better way to determine how an
answer to such "a question could be formulated.

An answer, according to Friedman, would
lead to the improvement and understanding of
an individual’s health and development through
health research, teaching and services related to
sexual orientation.

In the presentation, Friedman said that cur-
rent measures of sexual orientation are not
accurate. The- problem, heisaid, is that these
measures only examine a small portion of the
gay, lesbian and bisexual population. This pop-
ulation includes only adolescents who have
come out and openly admit their sexual prefer-
ence to themselves and others.

Friedman explained that there is a grave
danger in using this limited data because the
larger populations of homosexuals who'have
not acknowledged their sexual orientation are
the ones with inner turmoil. According to

Friedman, people who fit into this larger group '

are far more likely to experience depression and
other health risks as a result of confusions about
their sexual identity. '

Friedman’s study sought to develop a ques-
tion that would better determine the sexual pref-
erence of adolescents without using the conven-
tional labels associated with individual identi-
ties.

Friedman argues ‘that sexual identity and
sexual orientation are two separate topics and
should be studied as such. Through interviews
and focus groups, he was able ‘to determine that
students may consider themselves heterosexual

‘while still harboring feelings of attraction

toward members of the same sex.

Based on his research, Friedman was able to
conclude that a question examining the strength
of a person’s physical sensations associated
with sexual attraction is a more accurate mea-
surement of his or her sexual orientation than
one that asks whether a person considers him-
self or herself gay, lesbian or bisexual. _ i

This determinant of a person’s sexual pref-
erence would better represent the larger popula-
tion who do not want to associate _themselves
with a particular sexual group, Friedman said.

Though these adolescents do not consider
themselves gay, they may still have‘ sexual feel-
ings or experiences that will contribute to their
development and health. .. V

It is especially important, Friedman said, to‘

understand this group and consider them in the
development of treatments for adolescent health
risks.

RSA helps students figure

MONICA HERSH
For The Pitt News

As students begin their searchfor
on-campus housing for next semester,
the Resident Student Association hopes
that recent changes will help students
with their decisions. * -

RSA, a student-run organization
dealing with students’ problems, con-
cerns and questions about on-campus
housing, wants students to know that
the group exists tohelp with housing
decisions.

Sophomore Amy Nelson, president

of RSA, said that she’s disappointed —

with the small number of students who
come to them for help.

“The whole reason we are here is to
help students make a decision about
where .to live,” she said. “It really
upsets me‘ that they don’t take advan-
tage of it.” - . ‘

RSA consists of 10 board mem-
bers. Each residence hall on campus
has a hall council that includes a presi-
dent, vice president, secretary, treasur-
er and public affairs representative.
Each president, , representing their
building, makes up RSA’s executive
board. .

Nelson said that she became
involved in RSA her freshman year and
has worked to make. the group more
accessible to students. Board members

out the on-campus shufﬂe    

are required to have office hours

throughout the week and have been

. actively trying to get students involved

in their residence life.

RSA held a non-alcoholic drink
night in last semester and plans to ‘host
a day-long carnival in the Ashtray con-
cluding with an evening luau in the

beginning of April. Individual resi-.

dence halls also plan to hold special
events including Valentine’s Day activ-
ities, springtime outings and ﬂoor par-
ties.

An RSA award, still in the planning
stages, will be offered to resident stu-
dents based on leadership qualities and
academics. The "award will go toward
on-campus housing for fall 2002.

“Nothing like this has ever been
done by RSA before,” Nelson said. “I
thought‘ it would be a good idea to give
something back to some of the student.
leaders on campus who have been
working so hard and receiving little
recognition.” ‘s

Nelson hopes that these changes

will encourage students to stop by the ,

ofﬁce and talk with any of the board
members. ‘

Students with any concemsl about

residence life or questions about hous-
ing for next year can stop by the RSA
ofﬁce located in Towers lobby across
from the laundry room or contact any
of their residence hall representatives."

 

 

 

Many employers  say study abroad  
experience is attractive on a. resume

Study abroad, page 1‘

Placement and ACareer Services,
agreed thatpstudents benefit from the
challenges they face while learning

_ abroad. ‘

“Employers are telling us l’——
because they are competing globally
— that they are very attracted to
applicants who have traveled outside
of the U.S. who have a sense of cul-
tures and languages other than our
own,” Juliussen said. “The student
who has done that has the advan-
tage.”

Students were also able to learn
about a variety of international
experiences they could have here at
Pitt without going abroad‘. Staff
members from UCIS spoke with stu-
dents individually about a ‘variety of

opportunities, such as UCIS certifi- _

cate. programs. -

These programs enable a student
to enhance his or her degree with an
interdisciplinary set of courses relat-
ed to a foreign culture. _Students
interested in earning. such ‘a certifi-
cate are encouraged to study abroad,

.but not required.

Staff Writer

The first things you see are its red eyes. Not its head,
not even its body or its 7-foot wingspan, but two red orbs
ﬂoating in a sea of blackness. They are hypnotizing.

When you’re able to tear your gaze away from the
eyes, the next thing you notice is the wings, ashen in
color, growing from the back of what looks like a giant
man — a man with wings and red eyes standing at least
seven feet tall in front of you.

. This shocking image served as the inspiration behind
the movie “The Mothman Prophecies” and equally
shocking were the daily sightings of the movie’s star,
Richard Gere, running around Pittsburgh and nearby
Kittanning, Pa., with a camera crew in tow last spring.

‘”Ihe Mothman Prophecies” is based on actual
events that terrorized a small town over the course of a

year in the late 1960s. The movie —— though set in Point , 

Pleasant, W.Va., —— was ﬁlmed for the most part in

. Western Pennsylvania, so naturally a curiosity arose as to

where the story behind this strange and haunting movie
began. , '

The first sighting of the creature that became known
as the Mothman occurred at about 1 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 15,
1966. Behind the fairgrounds on the very outskirts of
Point Pleasant, two couples were out for a drive along
Lover’s Lane.

The road they were on crossed the path of an old
Army TNT storage warehouse. The warehouses were
built in the shape of an igloo and were covered with dirt
and grasses to better hide them. Linda Scarberry, one of
the women who was in the car describes the evening: “It
wasn’t raining, or foggy at all. It was a very clear, cold
night.”

As the couples approached the abandoned building,
they were struck by what they saw.

“When the headlights of our car hit it, it looked
directly at us, as if it were
scared. It had one of its

A memorial commemerating the battle between the Shawnee American-Indians and the Point Pleasant, '

Prophecies,” parts of which were filmed on Pitt’s Oakland campus.

Christrnastime rush hour onDec. 15, 1967, a stoplight

went out._ ‘
That stoplight was located at the end of the Silver
Bridge, which was built in 1.928 and carried hundreds of
cars across the Ohio River from Point Pleasant to Ohio.
As the number of cars stuck  on the bridge grew,
so too did the weight and

wire near a section of [the]
road, and was pulling on
its wing with its hand, try-
ing to free itself,”
Scarberry said. i
What they reported
seeing was a winged man
with giant red eyes.
Eventually freeing itself,
Scarberry says the winged
ﬁgure pursued the car, ﬂy-
ing overhead and chasing
the couples up the road.
Similar sightings con-
tinued as the year pro-
gressed. People claimed
they saw the winged man

thenext day inthe Point

?scene_ was described: “The
collapse of a towering sus-
pension bridge over the
Ohio River here Friday
plunged an estimated 60 to
70 vehicles into the cold

with red eyes crouched on
rooftops, shivering in the
cold. Others saw it walk-
ing around the forests near the TNT warehouses. One
man said it attacked and killed his dog while he was out
hunting in the woods.

In addition to Mothman sightings, people all over
Point Pleasant reported seeing UFOs ﬂying through the
sky. There are also rumors in town of men dressed in
black investigating barns and the old TNT buildings.

Almost a year after the Mothman’s ﬁrst sighting the
town was hit by acatastrophe. During the height of a

It took authorities three,

about the cause of the collapse:
According to a woman living in the town at the time,

weren’t sure. v

One popular theory that could help
explain what the Mothman could have
been traces it back to the end of the 1700s.
In 1750, a battle was fought on the land
that is now Point Pleasant.‘ The battle,
fought between the Shawnee American
Indians and Point Pleasant colonists, is
considered by Point Pleasant historians to
be" one of the bloodiest battles ever fought

between the two groups.

may have hidden out in the abandoned storehouses in the 1960s.

Point Pleasant profits from
the Mothman’s recent return

Out of the battle emerged a hero: a
Shawnee warrior named Comstalk. After
the battle, he hoped to make peace with
the people of Point Pleasant, but the story
of Comstalk explains that his aspiration

. was not fulﬁlled.

On Nov. 10, 1777, Comstalk was
lured into town after being told that he was
on his way to sign a peace agreement. But

instead of signing a peace treaty, .

Comstalk was violently murdered inside
Fort Randolph in Point Pleasant.

On his deathbed, legend has it that he
cursed the town of Point Pleasant for the
next 200 years. Almost 200 years later,
many people in the town believed the
Mothman was Comstalk coming back to
terrorize the town responsible for his
death.

Academic speculation
Smith, a professor at West Virginia
University, developed a second explana-

_ tion of the Mothman. He rationalized that

the creature was not a man with wings and
red eyes, but instead was a rare bird
migrating south for the winter.

Smith said that he thought the

Mothman, marijuana came to town at the same time, local waitress says

Mothman, page 9

Mothman was more likely a rare and
endangered sandhill crane that got lost in
Point Pleasant. Smith described the crane
as “6 feet tall with a bright red patch of
feathers on its head.” The historian posits
that the red feathers were mistaken for red
eyes, and the Mothman prophecies began;
The birds are known to land near humans,
strut, spread their wings and draw their
heads to their chests in a colorful display.

Point Pleasant today

Whatever the Mothman really was,
people living in Point Pleasant today have
mixed feelings toward it. Most people are
happy the events of 40 years ago have
shined a spotlight on their West Virginia

. town. Black and white block-print signs

decorate storefront windows throughout
the town reading: “The Mothman has
come back to Point Pleasant.”

, Two local merchants are especially
grateful to the legend. Jeff Warnsley and
Donnie Sergent Jr. are co-owners of a
Mothman souvenir shop in the historic

district of town. They admit that since the A

release of the movie, business has been up
dramatically. Warnsley is also the author
of the book, “Mothman: The Facts Behind

the Legend,” and he says his book sales on

Amazon.com have also been doing much
better.

Business has also increased at local
restaurants and diners, and local waitress-
es are more than willing to offer their

opinion on the Mothman. Dana Kebler, ap
' server at the Iron Gate Restaurant on Main

Street offered what she-. knew about the
Mothman. .

“I’m serious,” she said with one hand
on her hip, “ he killed a dog, back in the
‘60s about the time that marijuana got
really popular.”

“We think it’s a joke,” Kebler admit-

ted. Then, looking over at the bar across

the room she yells, “Hey, Holly, what do
you think the Mothman was?”

Holly’s answer: “I have no idea.”

As a result of the recent movie

release, many Point Pleasant residents are

‘ angry and offended about the fact that it

was not filmed in town.
'“We were irate, even though I don’t
believe in it,” Kebler said.
While pouring coffee and serving up

A platters of biscuits swimming in sausage

gravy, Sheryl Johnson, a waitress at
‘Melinda’s Diner, advised tourists not to
tell locals they are .from Pittsburgh. She
admitted that a lot of people are very upset
that the movie wasn’t filmed in Point
Pleasant. '

But despite their frustrations, they
have to be happy that the movie was
filmed in the ﬁrst place. The ﬁlm put Point
Pleasant on the map: day after day, tourists

-/

ﬂock to see the former stomping grounds
of a red—eyed man with wings.

’ Driving out of town across the'Silver
Memorial Bridge — the 1960s version
was rebuilt a few hundred yards down-
stream — it is hard to miss the newest
Mothman. Towering 15 feet in the air, he
waves goodbye to visitors. His eyes glow
red and his body twinkles in green. He is
a giant Mothman made from strands of
red and green Christmas lights.

The Mothman of the 1960s will like-
ly remain a point of speculation in histori-
cal accounts and diners, but one thing is
clear in the small town today: The
Mothman has returned to Point Pleasant,
W.Va.

If you vote, they will Come

Dear Bob Casey Jr.:

Tonight, Ed Rendell, your rival for
the Democratic nomination for gover-
nor of Pennsylvania, will speak at Pitt.
Where will you be? .

1 From what we understand, you
were invited to speak here, yet you
declined.

Meanwhile, this will be Rendel1’s
second appearance at Pitt. President
George W. Bush even spoke here
Tuesday. You’ve recently been to
Pittsburgh, yet not to Pitt’s campus.

Why not?

Other media outlets constantly tell
us that your strongest base is in Western
Pennsylvania, while Rendell’s is in the
east. Rendell is trying to reach out. Why
aren’t you?

Some might say this is_ arrogance -
on your part. Between-your. fa‘ther_’sc

name and your Western Pennsylvania
roots, perhaps you feel you have
already secured this region’s votes.

Don’t forget that students are a
large population. Also, don’t forget that
Pitt students come from all over the
Commonwealth — including from
Rendell’s strongholds. By not showing
up here, you’re losing potential voters
and a way to chip away at Rendell’s
stronghold.

Sincerely,
The Pitt News

Dear Students:

When you turned 18, you became
legal adults. Wltil the exception of drink-

ing, you received the same rights and v '

privileges that your parents have.

One of these is the right to vote. '

That’s correct — whenever there’s an
election, we can go out and vote in it. We
can walk into a voting place and, as long
as we’re registered — which is easy —
we can tell those in power how we feel.

Unfortunately, it seems that few of us
do. Except for the presidential election
between George W. Bush and Al Gore in
2000, voter turnout on this campus‘ has
been incredibly low. .

' No wonder Bob Casey Jr. won’t

come to speak on campus.

, ‘He must think it’s not worth his time.

Ar1dit’s hardto blamehim. ‘ .- - g - ’
¥We' have to‘ showpoliticalf candidates

that it’s worth their while to comehere.‘

These two men have different views
on many things.

Do you realize how important that
position is? In some ways, the
Commonwealth government affects our
lives more than the federal government.

So on May 20, get out and vote in the
primary for your party. Show those in
power that we do care and that they have
to listen to us.

Sincerely,
The Pitt News

Ashcroft cover—up: Attorney general needs makeover

For centuries, American men have
paid good money to see women expose
their breasts. Unforttmately, a few weeks
ago, our great nation took a giant step
backward.

Attorney General John
Ashcroft, after being pho-
tographed in front of a par-
tially-naked female statue in
the_Hall of Justice, commit-
ted the heinous act.
Apparently having never
seen a breast before, Ashcroft
became outraged at the pic-
tures that ran in several news-

 

David J. McCarthy

Columnist

His appointment as Attorney General
by President Bush outraged many
Democrats and liberals.

Ashcroft’s mega-conservative,
deeply religious, homopho-
bic, gun-friendly, sexist,
racist freak show might
have something to do with
it. Several prominent politi-
cal ﬁgures called Ashcroft
“unfit” for the job of the
country’s primary law
enforcer due to his close-
minded views.

Now, his recent cover-
up could be “curtains” for

“Not a fan of the ladies,”
as Darrell'Ham1nond"wt‘)'i‘1ld say, Ashcroft
ordered the “perverse” ﬁgure be covered
up. The fact that the statue-has been there

for over 100 years and“ represents" the

“spirit of justice” didn’t~.seem to faze
him. Shopping at Uncle -Sam’s Drapery
Gouge, he racked up a bill for $8,000
worth of curtains for that and another

statue. Surely that money*couldn’t be put

towardgreater things, such as, say, ﬁght-
ing terror.  ~

Veiling a few women will ' send‘ ’a"

strong message that oppression won’t
work in the United States. Oh, wait.

Ashcroft certainly didn’t need this
controversial move right now, consider-
ing over the past months he ’s been stock-
piling controversy.

his reputation. Note to

see that as a clothing line — or gtm line
— one day. After he achieves stardom on
MTV, Ashcroft can start rappin’ out his
life in the ‘hood: Toolin’ smack and
bustin’ caps.vThis is sure to improve his
relations with “home-boys,” or at least
white kids who want to be Eminem.
Maybe after his album, White Man

he can afford to have other deeply mean-

_ One last point: Does anybody think
that covering up a statue that represents

ment prepares to hold military tribunals
means anything?.We’ll just have to wait
and see. "

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

Morgantown, W.Va. — The
Panther. track team’s bus pulled up to
West Virginia University’s
Natatorium on Saturday, but no one
stepped off for 15, minutes.

“Rocky IV” was playing on the
VCR and Rocky Balboa was about to
knock out Ivan Drago.

When Drago finally hit the mat,
there were some laughs, there were
some half-hearted cheers and head
coach Steve Lewis pumped his fist
and said, jokingly, “Let’s go!”

_ But maybe deep down the
“Italian Stallion” did have an effect
onthe Panthers since they had some
performances at the State Farm
Classic worthy of allegiance changes
from the West Virginia faithful (like
when the Soviets started rooting for
Rocky). -

In a place that hasn’t changed
much since the fall of communism,
the Panthers came away with eight
first places and something special in
just about every event they entered.

Jesse Chalfant galloped out ahead
of the field in the 1,000—meter run
and stayed there for the six laps win-
ning with a time of 2 minutes, 29.56

seconds.

“I knew the field wasn’t that
strong,‘so I wanted to get out fast and

I take the wind out of the _ guys,” said i

Chalfant, who isn’t sure if he’ll be

concentrating on the 800 or the 1,000 '

from now until the Big East

. Championships. /
Chalfant used the same strategy -

in the mile relay, and he, along with
Anthony Fulton, Ryan Smith and
Marcus Walker, got the same result
winning the event (3:20.57). 1
Fulton led off strong and handed
off to Smith, who made his move to
the front of the pack in the last few
meters. That was all Chalfant needed
and it was a race forsecond by the
time Walker received the baton. ~
Beth Rocks’ strengths lie in the
middle distance events, like the 800,
where she’s provisionally qualified
for the national championships. But
on Saturday, she widened her range

to distances shorter and longer.
Rocks finished first among all
college runners in the mile and sec-
ond overall (5:06.34).
Later, Rocks was called into the
mile relay. Kim Lyles started off the

relay and handed to Rocks, who

never relinquished the lead. Not
many runners in the country have a
shot at catching Mera Belisle, the
third leg, who had a big lead and no
one did in Morgantown. Elizabeth
Bayne ran a smart anchor leg as Pitt
won.

Lyles also won the 400, while
Bayne finished fourth in the 800, just
behind teammate Janine Jones in

third. Belisle finished fourth in the 60 1

dash and led off the victorious shuttle

hurdles relay. ‘
The women went unchallenged in

the distance medley and took theponly

' place they could get with a time of

12:31.21

Dan Collier ran a great 400 leg
for the men’s distance medley, catch-
ing two runners and putting Pitt in
the lead. He was joined by Robert
Edgar, Jeryl ‘Wilborn and Mike
Diano, finishing second with a time
of 10:41.56. ,

Nicole Van finished second over-
all to an unattached runner in the A55
hurdles (8.17).

In the field, Amanda Walker just‘
edged out her nearest competitor by a
centimeter and» won the shot‘ put
(13.21 meters).

And an opponent finished ahead
_of Patrick Harding in the shot put for
the first time -this season. But
Harding didn°t go quietly. Hehad his
longest throw of the season on his

last attempt and finished a close. sec- 1

ond (16.97). i’ .
' “‘He beat me by about 20 cen-
timeters,” Harding said of Brian

Hallett of Kent State. “It was my best...

throw this season, though.”
Rounding out the top v finishes,

Lamoy Stephens took home second 

place in the long jump and the
women’s 3,200 relay finished second.

They’re on a roll.

The Pitt men’s ice hockey team, winners in nine
of their last 10 games, takes on Indiana University
of Pennsylvania tomorrow at the Airport Ice Arena.
Game time is 8 p.m. A .

The Panthers (14-10) will have their hands full
with a tough IUP squad (16—9—2). IUP was the last
team to down Pitt, 4-1, on Jan. 21.

The Division H Panthers started off the season
with a respectable 5-4 record, having played a num-
ber of Division I schools. The team later became
mired in a five-game losing streak, including an 11-
0 trouncing at the hands of West Virginia Dec. 1.

According to defenseman Shawn Bieber, the
team wasn’t playing together.

“We struggled because we weren’t playing as a
team,” he said. “We were playing as individuals.”

A week after the loss to WVU, Pitt traveled to
Penn State and came away with a 3-2 victory.
According to Bieber, the win was the turning point
in the season as it started the Panthers on their cur-
rent hot streak.

. “Everyone’s coming together,” forward Matt
Ronan said. “_We’re playing well and doing the lit-
tle things right.”‘

Head coach George Pavlic attributes the recent

- success to goaltending. “Chris Garman has been

unbelievable,” he said. The young goaltender has
11 of the team’s wins in goal.

Matt Hawryluk, who has 30 points, including
11 goals, leads Pitt on offense. Team captain Jake

Richter solidifies the defense.

Pitt is coming off a hard fought win over
Robert Morris Friday night at the Airport Ice
Arena. In a game that featured plenty of hard hit-
ting and defense, Pitt skated away with the 5-3 vic-
tory. '

Pitt was aggressive from the start of the game,
throwing its weight around and showing its team
speed. A hooking penalty against Robert Morris
less than four minutes into the game gave Pitt the
man advantage.

The Panthers capitalized on the power play
when forward Mike King snuck a shot by Colonial
goaltender Mike Wodzinski.

After a scramble down low, the puck slid to the
right of Wodzinski, where Hawryluk pushed it
across the top of the crease to King, who slipped it
across the line for a 1-0 lead.

Pitt added to its lead when Craig Halitsky, posi-

‘tioned down low along the boards and hit a cutting

Joe Perpetua, ‘who wristed the puck past the goal-
tender with 7 minutes, 6 seconds remaining in the
first period. King also assisted on the play.

Robert Morris got its first stab at the power

play when Pitt defenseman Kevin Konn was called

for holding at the 4:48 mark.

On the ensuing power play, Colonial Chris
Durko picked up a loose puck at the top of the right
circle and let loose a low wrister that beat Garman
short-side for an unassisted goal.

Sloppy play by the Panthers allowed Robert
Morris to control much of the play in the second

seriously in my job.

 

Spun-rs Vlnw

David McKenzie

That plan was only abandoned — at least for a

year —— two days ago when the
Minnesota Supreme Court refused to
grant a stay of an injunction forcing
the Twins to play the 2002 season in
the Metrodome.

Ever since Selig announced the
contraction plan, a plan the owners
approved .28-2, the commissioner has

with reason — that the _,Brewers
would be the main. beneficiaries of
_the 'I\>vins’ demise. In this case, the

So why, then, does the commission-
er of baseball not have to abide by rules concern-
ing conflict of interest? -. .

After leading an owners’ revolt that forced
Fay Vincent to resign as commissioner, Bud
Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, took the
office on an interim basis. He later became the
full-time commissioner.

To do this, he put his shares in the Brewers
organization into a trust and left the team to his
daughter’s administration.

Supposedly, this erases any potential conflict
of interest. But it is not nearly enough.

Brewers’ market would extend fur-
ther west. '

Then, last month, the Minneapolis Star-
Tribune discovered that Selig had accepted a $3
million loan from Twins owner Carl Pohlad in
1995 — when Selig was both an owner and act-
ing commissioner. '

This is a violation of baseball’s conﬂict of
interest rules, as owners — whoare supposed to
be competing -with each other .— cannot make
loans to each other.

It also makes one suspicious of the money
Major League Baseball is offering to Pohlad to

taken more and more fire for conflict .

fold the team —- much more than its market
value. .

While owners are supposed to watch out for
the individual interests of their respective teams

first and foremost, the commissioner’s job isto _

protect the interests of baseball as a whole."
Often, the interests of the, say, Brewers and

baseball in general can be in conﬂict with each -

other. Or,‘ the interests of the Brewers and, say",
the Twins, could be in conﬂict.

Both of those cases are why we have a com-
missioner.‘ The commissioner is supposed to be
above these squabbles, to act in the best interests
of baseball as a sport. By being an owner —— even
if not officially — Selig cannot do that. 9

Even if he is some sort of superhuman who
can put those conflicts aside, the appearance of a
conﬂict of interest is all that is needed for him to
lose his credibility. . ,

As such,.it is time for Selig to resign as com-
missioner of baseball and for the owners to
appoint someone more impartial as commission-
er. .

Either that, or perhaps they should just con-
tract the Brewers. After all, what place did the
Twins finish in last year? And what about the
Brewers? ‘

Manga had a double—double

_against the Fighting Irish, though
his efforts have not been able to
keep Seton Hall from being outre-
bounded throughout the season.

Sophomore center Toree Morris,
Zavackas and sophomore forward
Jaron Brown will be key factors in
the rebounding aspect of the game.

Morris dominated the boards
with 10 rebounds in the teams’ last
meeting. The 6—foot-4-inch Brown
leads the Panthers in rebounds with
an average of six per game, fol-
lowed by Zavackas with 5.3 per

tributor off the bench for Seton Hall

“He’s a guy who’s committed to the pro-
gram. He’s really had to rise to the occa-
sion.” ,

Of course, Harris had to ﬁeld ques-

A tions about the quarterback situation. ’

When spring practices begin, Harris will
have ﬁve quarterbacks in his arsenal
since Rod Rutherford, Pat Hodemy, Nick

Rizzo, Palko and fellow recruit Luke,

Getsy will allbe vying for the top spot.
‘ “We’ve graduated our starting quar-
terback. We’ve got some guys who’ve

been here and I want them to compete .
" against themselves.”

Harris continued, “Rod [Rutherford]
is competing against where he should be
as a redshirt junior and Pat [Hodemy] is
competing against where he should be as
a redshirt sophomore. I’d like to redshirt
them [Palko and Getsy] but I’d like them
to prepare as though t_l1ey’d start.”

With last season’s place—kicker Nick _
- Lotz graduating,‘ Pitt hopes that David

Abdul, Ohio’s aH-time leading kick scor-
er, can ﬁll the Void. Abdul kicked four
ﬁeld goals overi5O yards in his senior
season.

, _ Another Ohio product, Andy
Alleman could be effective immediately
in’ the‘ rotation at defensive end, a posi-

_ tion vacated by Bryan’ Knight. Alleman .
«is big, standing at’ 6-feet-4-inches and so

2335 pounds. .

v on the opposite side of the line is ' 0

Jason _Capizzi, a monstrous 6-foot-9'-
inch, 300-pound offensive lineman from

.Gibsonia, who was also a mid-ye,arv

signee. '

‘  “We’re real proud of Jason.’Capizzi.
He weighedgin at 263 pounds last year"

and  over 300 now,” Harris said. “It’s a
great tribute to him and [strength coach]

Buddy [lVIorris.]” .  .

, Two other local products, Steve
Buches‘ of Central Catholic and Jawan
Walker of Cathedral Prep will make their
way-toi~Pitt. -Buches was the top pass-
catching tight end  the WPIAL in 2000
 ‘2001, V while ’Wa1ker set the Erie

' County record with 2,430 rushing yards

last season.  V . . .

Joining Fitzgerald as a top-receiving
recruit: is Billy Gaines, who won three
state championships in Maryland.

When asked if recruiting has gotten
easier over the last ﬁve years for Harris
and his staff, he replied, “It’s easier but
harder. ~Wé have more respect but weive
upped our sights against more challeng-
ing, better schools for better players.”

Pitt’s recruits represent eight differ-'

ent states, including eight signees from
Pennsylvania, ﬁve from Ohio, one from
Texas, two from New Jersey, three from
Florida, one from Minnesota, one from
Maryland and one from Rhode Island.
The breakdown has Pitt signing four
offensive linemen, four linebackers, four
defensive backs, two receivers, two

, quarterbacks, two defensive ends, two

tight ends, one defensive lineman, ' one
running back and one place—kicker.

Recruit Josh

period.

Robert Morris knottedthe score-

on a delayed penalty with 14:48 to go
in the period, when Bob Smith
banged a shot in off the inside of the
right post.

Pitt jumped back ahead with two
minutes remaining in the period,

-when defenseman Derrick Bauer

notched his second goal of the season.
Bauer skated in from the right face-
off mark and put the puck past
Wodzinski on the near side.

Despite being outplayed much of

THE PITT NEWS

the period, Pitt took.a 3-2 lead to the
locker room. ' ‘

"Pitt scored what turned out to be
the winning goal with 11:51 remain-
ing in the game, when forward Bob
Mirzabeigi tallied his first goal of the
season. Scott Holtzer assisted on the
play. , 0

Robert Morris drew to within one
when Colonial Adam Ligman picked
up a rebound and shoveled it past
Garman for a power play goal.

Pitt put the game away with 2:28
remaining as Hawryluk broke in on a
two on one with Kent Homer and
roofed a shot into the top corner over

  i§“EAj\:RE         

Wodzinl<si’s glove hand. Dave Konn
also assisted on the play.

Pitt generated 34 shots to Robert
Morris’s 28. Garman was solid in

goal, making 25 saves.

Pavlic admitted that the A team
came‘ out sluggish, and may have
been taking Robert Morris for lightly
but that theteam “did what we had to
do to win.”

Pitt will follow the IUP game

with a contest against Washington and
Jefferson, a tough Division Iffoe,
Saturday at the Ice complex at
Southpoint. Game time is scheduled
for 7:30 p.m.
