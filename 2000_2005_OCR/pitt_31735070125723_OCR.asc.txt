Tuesday morning vigil honors victims
The PittNews

   
   
 

One week after the terrorist attacks that
paralyzed the nation, students, faculty
and staff gathered on the Cathedral of
Learning lawn yesterday morning to
mourn those lost.
Student Government Board held
the event from 8:45 am. to 10:37
am., from the time when the ﬁrst plane
hit the World Trade Center to the time
the last plane crashed in Somerset, Pa.
“It is diiﬁcult, none of us have been
through this before,” said Dennis
McManus, director of Pitt’s
Institute of Politics.
The vigil started with bag-
pipers playing “Amazing
Grace” followed by

“I thought it was important to remember
those who were killed,” senior Kaitlyn

SGB provided sheets of paper for
mourners to write journal entries about their
experiences and thoughts on the events.
SGB President Jeif Alex called the journals,
sponsored by the board, “a chance to vent on
paper-”

The journal entries will be bound along
with articles recently published in The Pitt
News, The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette and
other newspapers, and kept on public record
in Hillman Library.

“Besides being a priceless timepiece, it
can be a reminder of how Pitt’s campus

Taliban puts bin Laden’s fate in clerics’ hands

RAJIV CHANDRASEKARAN
The Washington Post

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The leader of Afglranistan’s
ruling Taliban militia rebuffed a demand by Pakistani ofﬁ-
cials to surrender alleged terrorist Osarna bin Laden to save
their impoverished country ﬁom a U.S. military attack, gov-
ernment sources here said Tuesday. ._

The Taliban leader, Mohammad Omar, has formall
shifted responsibility for deciding bin Laden’s fate to a coun-
cil of senior Islamic clerics. But a source familiar with the
talks Monday between a Pakistani delegation and the
Taliban leadership said Omar told Pakistan’s intelligence
chief, Gen. Mahmood Ahmed, that “Osama will be the last
person to leave Afghanistan.”

The clerical council was supposed to convene Tuesday,
but reports from the Afghan capital, Kabul, said the meeting
was delayed because of challenges in assembling the sever-
al hundred men who will decide the fate of bin Laden, iden-

tiﬁed as the prime suspect behind last week’s terrorist attacks

in New York and Washington. Taliban oﬁicials said the

meeting could be held Wednesday or Thursday.

As the clerics converged on Kabul, the Taliban urged"

Afghans to prepare for a holy war, and residents fearing U.S.
military strikes ﬂed the capital for the Pakistani border and
mountainous rural areas. UN. refugee oﬂicials estimated
that tens of thousands of people have left Afghan cities in
recent days. Reports of disturbances along the 1,500-mile
frontier prompted Pakistan to attempt to close all border
crossings Tuesday.

Though the council still has formal responsibility for
 bin I.aden’s fate, Omar has been the Taliban’s
undisputed leader since its formation seven years ago. Bin
Laden, who has lived in Afghanistan since 1996, has pro-
vided money and troops to help the Taliban, earning him
substantial support within the radical Islamic militia.
Analysts suggested Omar is unlikely to sunrender him vol-
untarily. "

handing him over to the United States would betray a tenet
of Islam. Even if a narrow majority of clerics decided to sur-

need medical attention

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

When underage Carnegie
Mellon University students who
have had too much to drink call
their campus police for help,
they’re guaranteed not to receive a
citation.

And if a drunk-yet-concerned
friend is the one who makes» the call
for help, he won’t be cited with
underage drinking either.

According to Sgt. William Ricci
of the CMU police, the policy has
been in effect for years, but is now

‘being widely publicized in an effort

to prevent students from falling
deeper into trouble they’ve already

gotten themselves into.

Ricci said the department will
overlook offenders when someone’s
life is in danger, regardless of a
state law against the offense.

“This is to save a life,” he said.
“Our message is that we don’t want
anyone to be in danger of losing
their life, and have someone who
isn’t willing to make that call.”

Ricci said CMU’s policy is that
there is “zero tolerance for under-
age . drinking on our campus,”
adding that the policenever hesitate
to cite underage students who they
find in possession of alcohol. _

Ricci said he recommends the
initiative to all university police
departments. “This really comes
into play on college campuses,” he
said, referring to the large number

of students present in a university

setting.
But according to Pitt’s interim
Chief of Police Tim Delaney, Pitt’s

. policy on alcohol is one that won’t

change.

“We have a zero tolerance poli-
cy at the University,” Delaney said.
“The purpose of a citation is for
education and rehabilitation, not to
punish [the students].”

Delaney said that in order to
maintain consistency, and in order
to make decisions more cut and dry
for responding officers, all alcohol
violations are treated as such.

“It’s the easiest and most suc-
cessful way to deal with the prob-
lem,” Delaney said, adding that Pitt

vvvvvv-pittnevv s - corn  

police efforts are heavily coordinat-
ed with Student Health Services
and the local magistrate.

Delaney said students in need of
medical attention might avoid
receiving a citation if they call 911,
but that often paramedics will actu-
ally call police, who then issue a
citation. He said that if police did-
n’t cite students who drank them-
selves into the hospital, they
wouldn’t be helping .them.

“The real question is are we
helping this kid along the way?”
Delaney said. ‘.‘I believe in our sys-
tem.”

Sophomore Laura Sitar is less
of a believer.

Pitt police carted an intoxicated
Sitar to the emergency room on
March 24. Then 18, she left the
night with three bills to pay.

The first, $490, paid the emer-

_ gency room bill. Another $225 went

toward a physician’s bill. And the

third, at a cost of $390, was the fine

for her underage drinking citation.

Sitar, now 19, said she finished
paying the bills only last month.
The political science major decided
to stay in Pittsburgh during the
summer, leasing an apartment here
strictly to prevent the three bills
from being mailed to her parents.

Sitar said she was nabbed with-
in 10 feet of her residence hall,
cited, put on a stretcher and
checked into the hospital with no
choice but to comply.

And though she thinks CMU’s
policy is a good idea, Sitar said the
greatest strife she endured as a
result of her citation was the hun-
dreds of dollars in hospital bills.-

“There’s no way I’d take any-
one to the hospital unless they were
on the verge of dying,” she said.
Sitar said that while some students

"might have more givinginsurance

plans, she wouldn’t want to bring
such financial problems upon a
friend. .

But, Sitar said, in an actual
emergency, CMU’s policy would be
a helpful one.

“My friends have passed out
before, and we’Ve said ‘Don’t call
the police, don’t call the police,”’
she said. “I think [CMU’s] policy is
a good one.” ‘

Pitt students help Red

Cross with disaster relief

LEE ANNE HUTCHISON
The Pitt News

“Hi, I’m an American. How can I

' help?”

This is what Pitt student Rob Roscioli
heard on the other end of the line while
answering phones at the local Red Cross

. Chapter in Pittsburgh last week.

“It’s amazing how many people
locally want to contribute to the relief
effort of last week’s terrorist attacks,” said
Roscioli, business manager for the Red
Cross Club. “I think this man’s call sums
up the attitude of the entire nation.”

Until Friday, club members will con-
tinue to volunteer at the Red Cross’

. Pittsburgh chapter Downtown by answer-

ing phones and entering data. A

“It’s overwhelming how many peo-
ple want to help,3’ said Katie Stehle, pres-
ident of the Red Cross club. “I answered
a call from a couple who wished to adopt
an orphaned child whose parents were
killed in the attacks. Another woman
called, asking where her father should
drop off a truck full of boots he recently

.. bought.”

_ ‘ The club received hundreds of e-
mails last week from students on campus
asking what they can donate and where
they can give blood for the thousands of

people injured in last week’s attacks on
the World Trade Center, the Pentagon_and
in Somerset County, Pa.

“It’s so encouraging when people
who are complete strangers will see me in’
a Red Cross T—shirt and instantly come
over and ask about what they can do,”
Roscioli said. “The whole nation is
responding.” - -

The Red Cross club reacted quickly
to last week’s attacks. On Friday and
Saturday, members ﬁom the club hopped
on the new UV loop, a free bus that stops
in Shadyside, the South Side, the Strip

District and several other popular \

nightspots. At each stop, members col-
lected money for the National Disaster
Relief Fund. They received a very posi-
tive response from the community,
according to Stehle.

“Some of our members had to go

home early because their cans were so. '

stuffed,” Stehle said. “I saw several $20s
and even $503 being donated.”
The club, along with Student

Government Board, is also sponsoring ‘

“Change America,” a competition fund-
raiser between on- and off—campus stu—
dents. The fund—raiser runs all week in the
Towers lobby and in front of the William
Pitt Union. A blood drive is also sched-
uled for Oct. 15 to aid in the relief effort.

They came in a caravan. ' ' - »

A group of 50 to 60 students, parents, P

teachers and youth ministers from
Fairﬁeld Christian Academy in Lancaster,

. Ohio, came to Pitt to take a tour of the

Nationality Rooms. It took them three
hours to .travel to the Cathedral of

, Learning yesterday.

The high school students toured the
Cathedral, listening to members of Quo
Vadis recite the history of each room. Quo
Vadis means “Where are you going?” in
Latin

' Ouo Vadis, a group of about 30 stu— ,

dents, gives tours of Pitt’s Nationality
Rooms in the Cathedral; its members have
been doing so for decades.

, “I wanted to learn more [about the
Nationality Rooms]. I have a travel bug, so

I wanted to learn about all the different‘
. countries,” Quo Vadis member___Christine

work-study job I could ﬁnd. Also, I like to

Kathie Fritz, the Quo Vadis adviser.

’ There are 26 Nationality Rooms, 24
of which are open for tours 360 days out of

An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people
visit the Nationality Rooms a year. Visitors

have come from as far as Korea and

Russia to visit the Cathedral.

Quo Vadis plans to host the Christmas‘

es the Nationality Rooms.

Fritz said the rooms originated with
Chancellor John Bowman, who wanted to
put Pitt “on the map.” In the early 1920s,

Five months in, SGB
without committees

ERIN BRACHLOW
Staff Writer

According to Student Government
Board president Jeff Alex, SGB is ﬁve
months behind in the formation of its
committees. A

In past years, the 11 committees,
which cover areas from freshman affairs
to the environment to technology, were
formed in January and disbanded in
December. .

But with the new election cycle —

with board members in office from April ’

to April — the board wasn’t formed until
the end of the spring semester. Alex said
the change gave SGB members little time
to advertise for the various committees or
interview potential chairpersons.

“We lost ﬁve months of committees,”

- Alex said. “There just wasn’t - enough
time.”

Being behind schedule with the com-
mittees means SGB has to work even
harder to meetthe demands of its agenda.
Normally, committees are made up of a
group of non—elected students who work
toward further goals of the board, as well
as taking on other projects. But without
committees, SGB’s agenda is left to the
board. ' V »

“The committees supplement the
board as well as complete individual pro-
~ jects,” Alex said. “'I‘here’s alot more work
now for board members because we’re
picking up all the slac ” ‘

Finding students to make up the dif-

ferent committees is not the hard part -

students can ﬁll out an application and
join at any time. But selecting a commit-
tee chair is more time-consuming.

After reviewing an average of ﬁve
applications for each chair slot, a ﬁve-per-
son selection committee sets up inter-
views and makes the ﬁnal decisions. The
selection committee — made up of Alex,
a committee liaison from the board, a sec-
ond board member, a former chairperson
and a former committee member — looks
for different qualities in a chair depending
on the committee.

“It varies for each position,” Alex ’

said, “but we basically look for a chairper-
son that can fulﬁll the obligations of that
committee.”

The selection committee must also
name all the members of the allocations
committee, in addition to its chair, because
of bylaws that ljmit_the committee to 10
members. Allocations is currently the on]
standing committee. A‘

Not only has the new election cycle
hindered the board’s progress, but the
count1y’s recent tragedy has put a hold on
operations as well. Just as the rest of the
nation paused to mourn and comprehend
the situation, Alex said, so did student
government.

Because of these events, Alex and fel-
low board members have extended the
due date for applications until Friday, and
the chairperson interviews will be held
within the following two weeks.

“We are behind and we need to form
these committees as soon as possible,” he
said.

pr CWO hosts Ember Swift concert  

\ EMILY SCHMITZ
The Pitt News

A Following a week of destruction and

tragedy in the nation, Campus Women’s
Organization unleashed its energy
Monday night at the Ember Swift-Kitty
Pryde beneﬁt concert.
" The concert was held to beneﬁt
IXCHEN, a women’s center in Nicaragua
that CW 0 president Andrea DeChellis has
worked closely with in the past. The con-
cert served as a reunion of sorts, as mem-
bers came together to kick off CW O’s
activities for this semester.

Kitty Pryde, a three—woman,
Pittsburgh-based band, opened the night
with a handful of rock tunes before Ember
Swift and her two bandmates took the
stage. The musicians peppered the band’s

_ set with anti—war- messages that sent
cheers through the crowd.

“I don’t want to be righteous up here
by myself,” said band member Lindel

Montgomery. “I want-you to be righteous ~

with me.” — .

As CW 0 members circulated through
the crowd with donation buckets, Swift
tossed her hot pink braids over her shoul-
der and walled, “A freak is__ a freak is a

freak is a freak.” Swift’s combination of [

folk, rock and punk sounds kept the crowd
moving as the night wore on.
As the event neared its end, Swift

called for what she referred to as “crowd f
participation,” yelling, “You girls can 
dance.”
' The dancing crowd took the stage en -‘

masse as the band ﬁnished up their set.

bers of the band signed autographs and 3:"

Sodexho switches it up

Jooi WEIGAND
Staff Writer

On Friday, a big chicken pranced
around Eddie’s, and on Thursday the yellow
block road will lead to Kansas. '

Some students might win a cardboard
cutout of Wizard of Oz characters Glenda or
the Wicked Witch of the West.

The activities and events are part of One
Wild Week at Eddie’s, a celebration that has
continued into this week because of the ter-
rorist attacks on Sept. 11. '

Frank Caruso, senior operations rnanag-
er of food services provider Sodexho
Marriott, created Wild Week to promote the
four new concessions — Sunset Strips,

Kansas, Selona grill and La Vmcita. /

The week began last Monday with a
chance to win a pizza party from La Vmcita,
and on Thursday $25 cash prizes as well as
rubber and beanie chickens were given
away to promote Sunset Strips. 

Students could enter the grand prize
drawing on Friday for a chance to win some-
thing from all four concessions.

The new concessions and the diﬂerent
layout of Eddie’s are the result of a customer
satisfaction survey given last October.

Sodexho gives the survey every
October and asks students about the fresh-
ness and quality of the food and employee
courtesy, among other things.

Jodi Ludovici, Sodexho marketing
director for the University, said two of the
biggest complaints were that the pizza was
terrible and the lines were too long.

Sodexho decided to improve the pizza
and give the concession a “new name and
new image so people would know it was dif-
ferent,” Ludovici said. i

To reduce the lines, Sodexho changed
the dining hall’s layout.

From the sales information,. Ludovici
said that about 44 percent of students were
getting food mainly from concessions to the
left of Tierra del Sol.

To even out the traffic, Sodexho moved
the Spit Fire Grill to the far left of the Eddie’s
and renamed it Kansas.

For the most part, Ludovici said, things
have evened out.

Sophomore Leslie Harris doesn’t think
Eddie’s has improved that much.

“It’s getting too crowded . . . and I don’t
think it’s any different really, the selection is
the same to me,” she said.

While some students may agree with
Harris and Azeles, junior Meghan Matthis '
enjoys eating at Eddie’s. 0

“I like it, it gives you a good variety of
places to choose from; that’s where we eat
most of the time.”

Whatever the opinion, Ludovici said,
“Fill out the-survey, because we are reading
them.”

had the opportunity to talk to the band and
sign up for its mailing list. CWO officers
were busy helping the bands pack up and
thanking them for being a part of the con-
cert.

“Ember is awesome. She’s so person-
able with the crowd,” DeChellis said after
the concert. “I hung out with her all day,
and she’s really an amazing person; really
earthy and fun.”

In addition to annual events such as
the upcoming Take Back the Night March
in October and its presentation of “The
Vagina Monologues” in February,
DeChellis said CWO hopes to
new directions this year.

“We’d really like to get away from

groups and asked them if they wanted a
room in the Cathedral to represent their
heritage. Bowman told the groups they
would have to raise the money to construct
the rooms on their own.

In .the 1920s, it cost $20,000 to

  $25,000 to build one room. Each room had

head in’

done in the past,” she said.

She said that the organization hopes
to work with other progressive groups on
campus, such as the Asian Students
Association and Students in Solidarity. In
addition to coupling their efforts with
other groups, DeChellis said CW 0 hopes
to work more actively on campus and in
Pittsburgh communities.

She said she hopes to see more talent
from within the group and within the com-
munity come forward with ideas.
DeChellis said that she’s seen many peo-
ple take powerful stands in the communi-
ty and that she’d like to see them become

- a part of CWO’s efforts.

“We’re all really excited about this
year,” she said. “I think this is our year to
experiment and to maybe get in over our
heads a little, but to really learn a lot.”

Bowman’s brainchild comes to life

a committee‘, and each committee worked
to employ artists, craftsmen and architects
from around the country.

But things aren’t ascheap anymore.

The University dedicated the Indian
heritage room in January 2000,‘at a cost of
about $500,000. Fritz estimated that it‘
would, be ﬁve to 10 years before the
University could dedicate another room.

render bin Laden, oﬁicials and analysts said,
he is believed to have as many as 3,000 well-

arrned Arab ﬁghters under his command

inside Afghanistan, as well- as the support of
many of the Taliban’s soldiers.

“It would not occur without a ﬁght,”
said Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani journalist

.and analyst “Ifthemoderates weretotryto

get him handed over, it would lead to a civil
war.”

Some Taliban oﬂicials repeated sugges- .

tions Tuesday that bin Laden could be trans-
ferred to another Islamic nation to face trial
in exchange for international recognition of
the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate gov-
ernment and a lifting of UN. sanctions on
Afghanistan, Pakistani oﬁicials said U.S.
oﬂicials, who have demanded bin Laden’s
unconditional surrender, have said such an
offer would be unacceptable.

Pakistani oﬂicials said their delegation

blunﬂy told the Taliban that if they did not
turn over bin Laden, ﬂiey would face certain
attack by a multinationalforce led by the

0 United States.

“Our delegation conveyed in stark
terms the gravity of the situation’ and what
the international community expects from
the Afghan leadership,” said Riaz
Mohammad Khan, a , spokesman, for
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry. . ‘

Before leaving Kabul, the‘ Pakistanidel-'
egation met with eight foreign aid workers
being tried on charges of illegally preaching

Christianity, a Pakistani oﬂicial told “the

Associated Press. Pakistan asked Taliban
auﬂiorities to release the aid workers —— two
Americans, four Germans and two
Australians —— and the authorities promised
to consider the request, he said

With a U.S.-led attack appearing
increasingly likely, Taliban leaders called on
Afghans to prepare for a holy war against ﬂie
United States, the oﬂicial Bakhtar News
Agency reported Tuesday. * '

“IfAmerica attacks our homes, it is nec-
essary -for all Muslims, especially for
Afghans, to wage a holy war,” state—run
Voice of Shariat radio reported Moharmned
Hasan Akhund, the deputy Taliban leader, as
saying. “God is on our side, and if the
world’s people try to set ﬁre to Afghanistan,
God will protect us and help us.”

In Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, about
5,000 people staged a boisterous demonstra-
tion to protest possible U.S. military action
against Afghanistan The protestors, chanti-
ng “Qsamais ourbrother” and ‘An attackon

A life—threatening policy

Imagine for a moment that you’re
sitting in your room or apartment, drink-
ing with a few of your close friends.
Imagine that one of them has had too
much to drink and suddenly passes out.

You’re afraid that your friend’s life
may be threatened. What do you do?

The logical answer would be to call
campus police. After all, they’re there to
help us, right? .

But then one of your other friends
points out that you are all underage.

And unfortunately for Pitt students,
it is the policy of Pitt police to cite any
and all underage drinkers they discover —
whether the drinkers are walking down
Forbes Avenue with an open- beverage
container or calling to seek help for a
friend. _ .

If a student calls to ask for assis-

tance, the police will help but will issue a '

citation. If the police find someone
passed out on the street clearly in need of
medical attention, the police will cite the
person, then take him or her to the hospi-
tal. .

But at Carnegie Mellon University,
students have the option to call their cam-
pus police for help — without being pun-
ished for it — when someone is in danger.
CMU has had this policy for years.

This policy saves lives, in itself, and
publicizing it saves even more lives as it
assures that students will not be afraid to

call the police if they need help. In fact,
the police will not even cite the person
making the call, no matter if that person
is underage and has been drinking.
Everyone should remember that the
legal drinking age is 21. Pitt police say
they cite all underagedrinkers because
they should be punished for breaking the
law and a citation serves as a deterrent.
But by issuing citations even when a
student’s life is at risk, Pitts police create
an atmosphere where students will be
afraid to call on them in their time of
greatest need. The police know how to
care for someone suffering from alcohol
poisoning, while most students do not.
Pitt police need to acknowledge that

.— gasp — college students who are not 21

will drink, and sometimes too much.
They can still cite drinkers who aren't at
risk of alcohol poisoning. . .

But when someone is in a compro-
mising situation, saving lives is much

more important than being concerned

with whether people broke the law.
Aren’t the police here to “serve and pro-
tect” anyway?

Pitt police should adopt a policy like-

the one at CMU, before someone dies.

Besides, wouldn’t almost losing your
life, waking up with tubes in your arms
and having to pay massive hospital bills
be enough of a deterrent without a cita-
tion on top of it‘? I

The rudest awakening
Attacks rattle MTV generation’s apathy

In light of last Tuesday’s terrorist
attack, my fellow columnists have devot-
ed much of this space over the last week
to venting an assortment of emotions.
And it was hardly two hours before I
wrote this that my column was going to

place to live. And_tl1en it happened.

As I walked down Fifth Avenue
between classes, Inoticed the ﬂags pro-.
truding from backpacks, watched them
ﬂutter in the wind from the '

ians. Just asthose clips would end, I’d '

turn almost on cue to Dad — a teacher,
principal and educator for more than 30
years — and ask him “What the hell was
that all about?” To this he would often
shrug his shoulders and reply, “I just
don’t understand it anymore.”

never bothered to further educate -myself

school history courses focused primarily V

needed the entire attack to evaporate from

was then I realized the cowardice in try-
ing to swallow the brackish tang of blood
lingering still in my throat.

My father and I used to sit and watch
the evening news together over TV din-
ners each night. As the national news
inevitably turned its coverage to the
Middle East I would watch live footage of
a tired, haggard correspondent standing
on a desolate piece of land billions of
miles away with a name he could barely
pronounce. .

We then watched in horror the clips

two minutes about the Middle East and
you will hear the stillness of silence.

The first nine months of Bush’s presidency yielded a A

nation polarized by politics. His enviromnental policies
angered millions. His unilateral approach to foreign
affairs isolated America from the global community. His
compromise on stem cell research satisﬁed few.

But since the attacks, Bush has managed to live up
to his previously ironic self-description of being a
“uniter.”

As a country, America has been drawn together by
the events of the last week. Bush, for his part, has deftly
guided our country during this time, relying not on the
charisma of John F. Kennedy or the dramatic courage of
Franklin Roosevelt but rather on a simple steadiness that

More than anything else, the Bush of the last week
has been human. His leadership has been inspirational in
part because he feels the same shock, grief and outrage
that the rest of the country feels. By continuing in’ the
face of such loss, Bush has managed to be a mirror for
the American people. His steadiness is the steadiness of
the policemen, ﬁreﬁghters and rescue workers. He is just
like any other man, struggling to do his part.

and most of the voters in this country, did not vote for last

Roosevelt’s gravity.

But in our nation’s darkest hour, when the American
people cried out for compassion, steadiness and humani-
ty, Bush will be remembered for lifting his head and say-_
ing, “I can hear you.”

When can I watch   ‘The Simpsons?’

Typically on Tuesdays at 5:30 p.rn., I,

serve to stop time and not enjoy our lives? If
anything, we should learn about the fragility

n’t force ourselves into a protective comer of
society where enjoyment is lacking.
America acknowledges that we were
brutally attacked, and we will never forget
that day. But I feel that as individuals and
more importantly, as Americans, we have to
resume our ways of living in a free society.
We will always remember those who
died that day. We will always stare in amaze-
ment at the footage of those two gargantuan

structures toppling down. Our actions

rise above those of any terrorist group.
How we must act can best be summed
up by a line ﬁom _our Pledge of Allegiance:

“IndiVisible, with liberty and justice for all.” '

My advice is that, as soon as possible,
we all move on with our lives and look for-
ward with hope for our great nation. So go.to
your local store, buy an American ﬂag and
wave it proudly, but don’t feel guilty about
moving on with your life.

Ben Folds Five minus Tour
’ Just like Michael Jackson

Rockin’ the Suburbs

Ben Folds
Epic Records

ﬂrﬁrﬁr

LESLIE HOFFMAN
A&E editor
Go to any Hallmark store, any card stationin a mall
or a supermarket, and you’ll ﬁnd an abundance of birth-
day cards whose total focus is to mock the idea of grow-
ing old. How can this phenomenon be? After all, birth-
days bring with them cards, presents, cake, goodwill,_etc.
But this year I lose my teen—ager status and am ﬁnal-
ly beginning to realize that each additional year marks

T another added responsibility. Growing up requires a cer-
‘ tain solemnity,‘a seriousness; growing up requires mak-

ing decisions. In addition to being n1iddle—class and
white, I very much identiﬁed with Ben Folds and his
recent release, Rockirz ’ the Suburbs.

The album’s cheeky title track pokes ﬁm at being

A male, middle-class and white. Ben Folds assures his lis-

teners, “It’s a bitch if you don’t believe/listen up to my

_ new CD.”

I hear ya, Ben. My biggest problem right now is the

A fact that I’m depressed about getting another year older

— and I’m not even 21 yet Therefore, I -was especially
moved as I sat -on my Ikea bedspread, ﬁnishing my

. homework, when opening strains to “Still Fighting It”
. started.  E -

' ter. Folds’ piano has always been what sets him apart

Folds bewails the trials of growing up, moving
away from home and growing apart from friends. He
sings, “Everybody knows it hurts to grow up/but every-
body does/it’s so weird to be back here.” It is true; grow-
ing up hurts, and this song is actually very touching.

Folds’ clear voice and his simple piano make
“Annie Waits,” the album’s opening track, serious yet
hopeful. Folds revisits the Ben Folds Five album
Forever and Ever Amen with “Fred Jones Part 2.” This
sad song visits the pain of actually growing old. It’s Fred
Jones’ last day at his job where he’s worked for 25 years.
For Jones, “today’s just a day like the day that he start-
ed/and no one is here that knows his ﬁrst name.”

Rockin’ the Suburbs’ lyrics on the whole are better
than Folds’ albums with Ben Folds Five. Sometimes his
lyrics would fall just short of being truly clever. The ﬁrst
album is riddled with songs with detestable lyrics; prime
examples include “Sports and Wine” and “Uncle
Albert.”

This album also shows Folds’ maturation as a
dynamic pianist. Some melodies from his songs bear a
resemblance to previous work, but he’s made them bet-

from other white, rr1iddle—class male pop stars, but his
piano melodies have suddenly become less show—oﬂish,
yet more complex and more developed. His playing is
more humble.

A common thread rtmning through Rocldn’ the
Suburbs is the theme of growing up} and dealing with
what life requires of us. While unmistakably Ben Folds,
this album is cleaner and more interesting than his previ-
ous albums. '

Maybe Folds just grew up.

The liner notes to Dave Douglas’
IVtness say, “How do you protest a system
that co-opts and marginalizes almost every
unique and original thought that conﬁonts
it? And how do you stay silent?”

"Advertisers market any challenge to
the status quo within two weeks as a T-shirt

or bumper sticker. Teen-agers, at shopping,

malls sport Rage Against the Machine T-
shirts plastered with Che Guevara’s face.
We can say whatever we want. We are
guaranteed that. But there is no guarantee
that anybody will listen. More likely, our
voices and desires will be fashioned into a
new logo, worn by those who agree.
Together we gather at concerts and coffee
shops with our rebel clothes and spend
most of our energy trying to get laid.
Douglas created a very good album of
music without lyrics, inspired by radical
politics and struggle. The music jumps
between beautiﬁil and ugly, until these
adjectives seem to become interchange-
able. The music provokes questions about
ideas of beauty and about music, but with-
out the liner notes I am lost as to the poli-
ties. The album’s struggle, and indeed the
artist’s struggle, is to ﬁnd a way to express

‘easily fall into the category of radical poli-

THE PITT NEWS

politics without the message becoming co-
opted.

In the music listeners ﬁnd minute
squeaks and sounds, snippets of beats and a
little blare of a horn. You can hear hum-
ming and clapping and samples. In a 24-
minute song, Tom Waits’ voice drifts in and
out. At one point a violin plays rapidly. The
effect is similar to someone masterﬁrlly
orchestrating samples and drum machines,
electronically altering each sound and fas-
tening them together into a collage of
music. V "

But here, there is very little of that. The l
violin’s tempo is not mechanically altered,
but played rapidly originally. There is some
sampling, but the album consists mostly of
playing, and the diiference is notable. The
horns sound beautiful when they aren’t
canned and looped. Each player goes where
he wants, in tangents, then silent, and back
loud and discordant. It creates an awesome
dynamic. .

With Witness, Douglas attempts to
bring politics to the forefront of jazz. Each
song is a kind of ode to a different person or
movement who has politically inﬂuenced
Douglas. For example,‘ the song “Ruckus”
is named for the Ruckus Society, a group
that trains direct action protesters.

The album liner notes list books and

political struggles, "each of which would

Temptations

Eternal

The Isley Brothers
Dreamworks
virsﬁrik

VV1th Mario Lernieux’s comeback and Michael
Jordan’s anticipated return, it’s easy to overlook the
rebirth of the Isley Brothers. But it’s impossible to for-

get these icons’ impact on rock ‘n’ roll.

The immortal Isleys are still making music after

 

more than 40 years. Their new album, Eternal, splash-
es onto R&B charts with the hit single “Contagious,”
which is just that: A case of funky beats and erotic
betrayal. -

At ﬁrst listen, the music on this album seems like a
distant cousin of 1969’s It’s Your Thing and 1973’s
Who’s That Lady. But once you become more familiar
with Eternal, the similarities surface. There is still that
certain groove in their music that made those oldies
timeless.

The Isley Brothers have taken their renowned sexy
and soulful mood, and chiseled it into an acutely distin-
guishable style of music. If you are planning to woo
your latest crush this weekend and you are a zealous stu-
dent of the late, great Wilt Chamberlain, this is the CD
you want and need. It’s certainly sexy, it’s intoxicating,
and most of all — the message is love.

“See, if it’s loving you/taking care of you/or being
true to you/I’ll do whatever you want me to.” These
lyrics from “You Deserve Better” and other romancing
lines are delivered in style, f111l of soul. Ronald Isley, aka
Mr. Biggs, still has that same Rock and Roll Hall of

Fame voice that helped induct the brothers in ‘1992.

The Isleys also interpret the Chicago song, “If You
Leave Me Now.” Other tangible attractions are the
music to “Think,” which is written by Curtis Mayﬁeld
and the track “Contagious,” which is both written and
produced by R. Kelly.

Adultery, secret getaways on yachts, commitment
and passionate lust are only a few of the tempting sub-
jects covered in these 14 tracks. But these subjects
would make rather intriguing themes if it weren’t for
their regularity on this album. Eternal consists of a
homogenous collection of sensual love songs, which
leaves the album feeling a bit bland.

Despite these few faults, it is still amazing to see a
band with such a fantastic history inﬂuence popular
music.

But if anyone can make a successful retum to
music, it is surely a few of the fathers (or shall I say
brethren) of rock ‘n’ roll. The Isley Brothers might just
make it to 50 years. Let’s just hope.

The Crystal Method
lnterscope Records

a-at/2

Four years since Vegas, the boys of The Crystal Method have
produced a sophomore album with the intent of being better and
more aggressive. But along the way, they created something with
less emotion and humanity. I

Tweekend is a rare electronica album with barely any progres-
sion. The songs in this album do not have many climaxes. The
instruments, beats and other random noises build up, but the tempo
and mood of all songs remain consistent throughout. As control
freaks, the men behind The Crystal Method, Scott Kirkland and Ken
Jorda_n, are too conoemed with perfecting the beat,‘which has result-s
ed in too much science and not enough philosophy. .

Tweekend is far more aggressive than Vegas. But the intent of
the group remains pop—on'ented. The whole album sounds like a
knock-oﬁ‘ of Depeche Mode or New Order. -The inﬂuence of the rap-
rock movement, which lingers due to Limp Bizkit, is noticeable in
some songs, especially on the ﬁrst single, “Name of the Game.”
Sadly, the song works best for the Powerade commercial that uses it.

Vlfrth all the guitar riffs and big beats, The Crystal Method tries
to whole their sound to those who wouldn’t normally listen to it.
There is nothing wrong with creative experimentation, but Tweekend
is the same sound with different instruments and a variation of riifs.

VV1th the addition of the guitar and big beats, the album also uses
layers of the random noises everyone associates with techno. But
these noises are used to complement the guitar riffs. In some songs

Volleyball takes out Robert orr 

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Staff Writer

The'Panthers volleyball team kicked
off their home schedule last night with a
3-0 (30-21, 30-21, 30-27) sweep of cross-
town foes Robert Morris at Fitzgerald
Field House.

The Panthers (3-5) ended their.pre—

season schedule on a positive note after

going winless at the Michigan Pepsi

- Challenge 10 days ago.

Robert Morris boasted a 6-2 record
coming in, but a long layoff because of

the tragic events of last week gave Pitt

plenty of time to prepare for the
Colonials, who have never defeated Pitt.

“It’s good to get the win,” Pitt head
coach Chris Beerrnan said. “That’s a very
good team; they control the ball well and
they are well-coached.”

The Panthers kicked off the first
game with two consecutive points before
jumping to a 4-1 lead. But the Colonials
kept it close early on, and midway
through the match Pitt clung to a 15-12
lead.

The Panthers proceeded to run off
ﬁve unanswered points to grab an eight-

point lead, their largest of the evening.

The Colonials responded with a mirii-run
but Pitt ended the game the same way
that they started it, scoring the last two
points of the contest and guaranteeing the

30-21 victory.

Pitt sophomore Wendy Hatlestad
was a force at the net in the first -game
and ended her evening with a team-high
41 touches on the attack. A .

The Colonials led off the second

game with a service error into the net and.

it looked like smooth sailing for the
Panthers once again as they jumped out
to a 3-0 lead. But Robert Morris would-
n’t go away, and while Pitt never trailed
in the first game, the Colonials scored
four straight to grab their first lead of the
night.

“The bottom line is they played bet-
ter after the first game,” Beerman
explained. “We kind- of stayed at the
same level while they kept getting better
as the match went along.”

The two teams traded the lead four
times before Pitt grabbed another 15-12
lead at the midpoint, and a couple of
Panther rims increased - that margin to
eight late in the game. .

With a 28-21 lead, the’ Panthers
showed their defensive prowess in a
sequence in which the 6-foot-3-inch
Hatlestad and 6—foot-1-inch senior
Heather Haff stood side by side at the net
andlblocked everything that came their
way. . .
The Panthers clinched yet another

In the third game, Pitt jurnped:anoth-

midway through the game led to ,a 22-14
Pitt lead. It looked like business as usual
for the Panthers, but this would prove to
be the closest game of the evening. ‘

After trading points, the Colonials
went on a ﬁve-point run of their own to
tie it up at 24 late in the game.

The teams traded blows once again,
and Pitt clung to a 28-27 lead. But the

West Virginia gets time to heal during
canceled weekend
West Virginia took advantage of a bad

situation by nursing its players back to health .

so that they would be ready for this week-
end’s home game against Kent State.

“A couple of our guys are back practic-
ing,” head coach Rich Rodriguez said.

' Wide receiver Antonio Brown, defen-
sive tackle Antwan Lake and defensive end
James Davis, the “ankle guys” as Rodriguez
referred to them, return this week from
sprained ankles.

Linebacker Grant Wiley is questionable
_for the game, while comerback Shawn
Hackett is expected to play. Both suffered
from strained harnstrings. Freshman quarter-
back Rasheed Marshall is most likely out for
the season with a broken wrist.

“We’re excited to be playing again,”
Rodriguez said “The time off might help us
with players recuperating but it also might

_ disrupt our rhythm.”

For a few weeks Rodriguez had Derek
Jones at wide receiver, but he has since
moved the athletic. Jones to quarterback to
make up for the loss of Marshall.

“He’s done a good job of grasping the

I system and we’re getting more conﬁdent in

him, and he’s getting more conﬁdent in him-
self, but Brad Lewis is our starter right now,”
Rodriguez said

Rodriguez saidhisteamisstillinthe

“We had some good practices and
we’ve got a lgt of young guys playing, so we

he said‘ _
Unlike many programs in the confer-

ence, Rodriguez did not. send any of his .

coaches to recruit over the weekend
Last week’s postponed game against
Maryland will be played on Sept 29.

Beamer pleased with Hokies’ quarter-
-backNoelastc.-amheads togRutgers
' Virginia Tech did not have a game‘
scheduled last weekend, so theteamhas had
two weeks to prepare for Rutgers. The
Hokies have defeated Rutgers eight straight
times, most recently defeating the Scarlet
Knights 49—01astseasoninBlacksbmg.
“We had three good practices last
week,”Beamer said “Rutgers is a team

that’s excited about their program They play _

hard and we’ve got to expect the unexpect-
ed” .

’ In its ﬁrst two games against
Connecticut and Western Michigan, Virginia

Tech outscored its opponents 83-10. _ '

Leading theteaminthe two lopsided victo-
ries was quarterbackGrantNoel, who is in
hisﬁrstyearasastar1:er,afterMichaelVrck
left to become the No. 1 pick in the NFL

draft.

Noel has completed 29 of 45 passes this
season for 411 yards, four touchdowns and
no interceptions.

“Grant has been excellent,” Beamer
said. “He’s got a conﬁdence about him, and
he understands that he’s not Michael Vick.
He’s looked forward to replacing Michael,
and he’s done very well in the ﬁrst two ball
games.”

The Hokies also have some players
recovering from injuries.

VV1de receivers Richard Johnson and

 

Emmet Johnson will be back along with
defensive end Jim Davis for the Rutgers
game, while linebacker TJ. Jackson is still
questionable.

Pasqualoni gets Syracuse ready for
another tough SEC foe in Auburn

Syracuse head coach Paul Pasqualoni
didn’t hesitate to say that this year’s schedule
is among the toughest that he’s ever had to
face as a coach.

“We’ve played high—powered non-con-
ference opponents over the year,”

Fasqualoni said

“My ﬁrst year we played Florida and ‘

Florida State and we’ve played Michigan
and Tennessee in the same year before,.but
this year we’ve played Auburn and
Tennessee. But the kicker is that Central
Florida was a good team and so is East
Carolina and Georgia Tech, so this non—con-
ference schedule is absolutely the toughest
that I’ve faced,” he said.

Auburn is the second team from the

tle shaky with our conﬁdence, and with a
young team, you’ve got to get back on
the winning track as soon as you can,”
Beennan said.

“I thought the practices were really
focused on certain areas and we did sev-
eral things well in practice,” Beerman
said. “It really gave Gini a great chance
to get in our starting lineup for long
proactive periods of time. And you could
"see that tonight she really felt a lot more

‘ comfortable.”

The Panthers kick off their Big East
schedule on Saturday at Providence.
Despite Pitt’s dominance over Robert

Morris, Beerman saw many things he
would like to work on heading into con-
ference play.

“We need to pass a lot better. We had
way too ‘many errors...we’ve got to be

‘smarter as situational hitters, and that’s

another thing that comes with experi-
ence. Those things will keep getting bet-
ter with time,” he said.

Beerman said that he is excited about
his team’s prospects in conference play,
and is looking forward to the challenges
the Big East will bring.

“It’s really the end of our preseason,
and we’re really excited to get into our
conference play and see what the Big
East will be like this year,” he said.

The Syracuse coach did note thathe had
a great defensive player of his own in line-
backer Dwight Freeney.

“He plays with his motor going at 100'

mﬂes per hour at all times, regardless of
what play number it is,” he said.

RJ. Anderson will start at quarterback

Freshman quarterback gets  against .

Bowling Green
Temple will look to rebound from a 33-

-7 loss to Toledo this weekend at Bowling

Green.

“Bowling Green has a tremendously
improved football team as they beat
Missouri and Buﬁalo,” Temple head coach
Bobby Wallace said. “Their defense is real-
ly hard-hitting, starting seven seniors.”

Bowling Green is going to the spread‘

offense, like many schools, including Pitt.

Wallace said that it will be good for his
team to get away as a group.

“We have a lot of potential and we’re
starting our freshman quarterback, so hope-
fully we’ll come together,” he said.

Starting at quarterback will be freshman
Mike McGann. McGarm _played in the
Toledo game, completing ﬁve of 17 passes
for 60 yards, one touchdown and two inter-
ceptions. ‘ ‘

Rutgers goes for ﬁrst win against Virginia

Tech since 1992

The last time Rutgers beat Virginia Tech
was in 1992, when it came away with a 50-
49 win.

“Obviously they’re a very talented foot-
ball team,” Rutgers head coach ‘Greg
Schiano said. “We’re very -excited to play
our second top 10 team, and it’s_ going to be
a great challenge”.

The ﬁrst top 10 team that Rutgersfaced
this season was   crushed the

- Scarlet Knights 61-0.

“We have so many things to improve

on, it’s not like we’re'in a program that’s- 2

established and V we’re‘ just ﬁne tuning
things,” Schiano said. “By the end of the
week we’ll be ready to play.

VV1th regard to the tragedies from the
previous week Schiano said, “It did effect

our players. We’re the closest to the situation 2

out of the teams in the Big East, but we’re
staying focused even though many of our
players are from the New York area.” '

Rutgers’ postponed game against
California has been rescheduled for Nov.
