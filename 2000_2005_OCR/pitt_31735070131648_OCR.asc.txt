FBI looks for
commitment,
technical skill

HALI FELT
Staff Writer

Preparing for a career with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is harder than some

aspiring students might think

And only after reaching the ripe old age

of 23 can the quest begin.
According to special

agent James

Knights, Pittsburgh’s FBI applicant coordina-
tor, the age requirement is designed to ensure
commitment — the kind of commitment that
someone fresh out of college might not be

able to make.

“We are looking for people who are look-

ing for careers,” he said.

That means applicants must prove their
unwavering interest in their discipline by
having a significant amountof work experi-

ence before coming to- the FBI.

The FBI seeks only applicants who pos-
sess certain “critical skills,” Knights added.

Such skills come from degrees in computer."

science and engineering and physical sci-_
ences, as well as foreign language ﬂuency

and military, law enforcement, intelligence or: .

counter—terrorism experience.

:

In other words, the FBI does not simply
look for people with criminal justice degrees.

“Majoring in criminal justice creates ‘an
unrealistic expectation,” Knights said.

He recalled many applicants who had
been told by someone, at some point, that get-
ting a degree in criminal justice would help

them get jobs with the FBI.
They were wrong.

“It’s easier for the FBI to teach a comput-
er scientist or an engineer about criminal jus-
tice, than. to teach a criminal justice major
how to be a computer-scientist or an engi-

neer,” Knights added.

Once applicants have met the,_age and

critical skills requirements, they’ must go
through a comprehensive background ‘check,

as well as physical fitness, drug and poly- _

Chinese raid newspapier,idetain seven

reported, and seem to be escalating.

For those who thought authoritar-
ian rule in China had released its grip
on the country, a police raid, along
with the subsequent questioning of
seven newspaper officials, shows that
whatever advances the country has
made toward opening to .»the world,
China has not improved its policies
concerning freedom of the press.

The raid occurred at the Southern

A Metropolis Daily — a Chinese news-

paper based in Guangzhou that
recently broke the story about an
unpublicized - Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome case at a local

‘hospital. The Daily also found itself

in political jeopardy last year after
reporting on the death of a man in

' police custody.

According to the state-owned
Nanfang Daily Press Group, of which

» the newspaper is "part, the raid was

ordered under the pretense of
inspecting the company’s financial
practices. _

But, as The New York Times
reported Jan. 7, this is standard prac-
tice when the government disagrees
with a state-owned company.

Two other of the Group’s mem-
bers —— Southern Weekend and 21st
Century World Herald —- have been
censured for the political tint of their
articles, and the latter was "shut down.

Clearly, China doesn’t want its
people to know about potential health
risks — ones that have been widely

The government seems desperate to
maintain its facade of infallibility, no
mater what the cost to its‘ citizens.

Authoritarianism isn’t dead just
because there are free trade zones
and most-favored—nation trading
privileges, the latter of which the
United States continues to confer to
China.

Yet, the question arises: What can

the United States do in light of these '

events? ,

_ Issuing , a public statement —
supporting the arrested officials, and
espousing the virtues of _an unhin-
dered media —— would be a start, but
there would be no guarantee that it
would reach the people at whom it
was aimed. .

Still, if President George W. Bush
cannot speak to the Chinese people,
he can speak to the world communi-
ty, and condemn China’s actions.

Freedom of the press is crucial to
a modern society. China’s recent
trade developments — such as open-
ing certain sections of the country to
capitalism — demonstrate that the
country must adapt to modern eco-
nomic demands. I *

But if China wants to modernize
its economic practices, it must also
update its civil rights policies. .

_ And part of that is not silencing
newspapers that dare to report the
truth.

“Sex” addresses complex love issues

With seven HBO channels now to
choose from on digital cable, I often catch

up on the latest episodes of “Sex and the

City.”_ _
.“Sex” is a comedic-dramatic mini-
series, in its ﬁnal season, about four fash-
ionable -— and rather sexual -— women liv-
ing, working and dating in Manhattan, and
sharing their sexual secrets with half of
America.

Sarah Jessica Parker plays the lead
character, Carrie Bradshaw. Carrie is a
columnist for a daily newspaper in New
York City and draws on the
problems and events of her
own life, and those of her close
friends, as inspiration for her
columns.

Carrie and .Miranda
Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon),
along with their two closest
friends, Samantha Jones and

and Kristin Davis, respectively
— discuss everything from dat-
ing and relationships to bed-
hopping and being single — all
while being fashionably accessorized and
maintaining successful careers.

None of the four women seem quite
satisﬁed as they bounce from one man to
another, looking for anything from the
biggest and best orgasm — Samantha’s
quest — to the picture—perfect family,

g which is Charlotte’s goal.

So, how did four women in their mid-
40s and then some — Kim Cattrall is near-
ly 50 —,— seem to steal the hearts of their
viewers?

Despite the characters’ ages, many of
their viewers are much younger. Some say

9 it doesn’t matter, because relationships are

complex at all ages. But could these images
of being single and still bed-hopping in
your 40s give wrong impressions to those
in their teens and 20s? I think tl1at’s a very
valid claim, but at the same time, we must

. , . . . . . . V . . . . . . .

 

Christine Claus
For The Pitt News

remember that people like Samantha are
extremes.

So what keeps viewers so eager to time
in to “Sex”?

Is it Carrie’s persistence to ﬁnd out
what love really means? Samantha’s
shocking sexual comments and actions?
Miranda’s need to be a successful career
woman? Or Charlotte’s desire to be happi-
ly in love? Whatever it is, millions of
Americans tune in to HBO every Sunday
night to see what these women will do next

Perhaps many viewers want to see
Carrie back with Mr. Big.
Mr. Big, a former love inter-
est of Canie’s, is the one that
got away —— or rather the one
that won’t go away.

Many viewers can relate
to her feelings toward Big
and maybe even have caught
themselves in that scenario.
Once Carrie gathered up the
courage to say goodbye to
Big for good, it wasn’t the
end. She asks, “Just how
dangerous is an open heart?”

The episode “ e” caught my atten-
tion. Miranda was having a diﬂicult time
saying, “I love you” to her boyfriend,
Robert, perhaps simply because she does-
n’t love him in return.

feels ir1 words, but in chocolates. He buys
her a large cookie that says, “I love you” on
it with chocolate chips. Miranda got the
message. Unsure of how to react, she

She kept hoping that the right man

Bush’s proposed immigration policy evicts potential workers

Note: This is the ﬁrst part of a two-
part series dealing with the United
States’ immigration policies. The second
part will run on Monday.

President George W. Bush, on Jan. 7,
proposed changing the United States’
immigration laws. Bush’s plan would
permit workers illegally in the United
States to join a temporary labor program,
granting them tllree-year worker visas,
which could be renewed once.

The newly-legal temps would be
guaranteed wage and employment rights
as long as they were working, and would
be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship at
the termination of their visas, though
they would be granted no preferred status
in the lottery that all would-be immi-
grants must enter into to become
Americans. If the immigrants lose in the
lottery, or if they lose employment dur-
ing the term of their visas, they would be
obligated to return to their country of ori-
gin.

It’s good to see the president putting
the revision of immigration law in the
political spotlight, and surely this pro-
posed relaxation of the law is a step in
the right direction. But Bush’s proposal
is at best a half measure, and insufﬁcient
for fairly reforming America’s immigra-
tion policy.

There are conservatives in Bush’s
party who think even this is going too far.

Their arguments center on the notion that
immigrants are a burden on the United
States’ economy.

Ilnmigrants make a great contribu-
tion to America’s econo-
my. In the most thorough
survey of its kind to date,
the National Academy of

he’s already overseen the loss of 3 ml-
lion jobs in America, which I suppose
equalizes things a little. Way to help out,
George! 4

In any case, the argu-
ment that immigrants are a
burden on the U.S. econo-
my simply isn’t true. Wltll

Furthermore, the U.S. Bush’s plan does noth-

dicted, at the time of the survey, that
between 1998 and 2008, 20 million jobs
would be created in America, with only
17 million native-bom Americans avail-
able to ﬁll them, prompting Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
say that, “there is an effective lilnit to
new hiring, unless immigration is
uncapped.”

Now, the president is doing what he
can to make up for this labor shortfall by
eliminating jobs in the U.S. economy ——

citizenship of those who would partici-
pate intlle temporary workers program,
which . has drawn criticism from
Democrats in Washington. As presiden-
tial hopeful Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-
Conn) pointed out, “George Bush’s plan
leaves foreign workers as fodder for our
ﬁelds and factories, without giving them
a path to legalization and a fair shot at the
American dream.”

Since many of the illegal immigrants
eligible for Bush’s temporary visas

would be those already employed in the
United States, it’s safe to assume that
many of them have been contributing for
years to the U.S. economy without
receiving any of the beneﬁts that U.S.
workers enjoy.

Additionally, after receiving a visa,
even newly anived immigrants would
spend up to six years contributing to the
economy. To think this doesn’t entitle
them to preferential treatment in the
bestowal of citizenship is patently unfair.

Furthermore, the same NAS study
found that, during their ﬁrst years in the
United States, immigrants tended to be a
net cost to the economy. After 10 or so
years, however, they tended to be a net
gain. If the country goes ahead with the
Bush plan, it would be evicting tens of
thousands of productive workers just
before they were able to start to substan-
tially contribute to the American econo-
my. ‘

And so the Bush plan only reasserts,
rather than corrects, the ill-inforlned idea
that ilnrnigrants carmot make a lifelong,
long—term contribution to America.

low Democrats to vote for Joe
Lieberman in the coming presidential

A few day_s before the rush

that many retailers had simply

I do suppose there are some
downsides to the iTunes music store,

Oncethe novelty wears off, the real impact
of downloading on the way musicians create,
package and promote their music will be shown,
and I feel as though that’s something to be excit-
ed about. People look at the record album as
though it were integral to our concept of reality.
For us, it’s something that’s always been there.
Inasmuch as welisten to, and love, albums that

Obviously, such a fear is ultimately
what drove Metallicainto the court-

about 4 the music industry has
changed ‘before and it will change
again. The only difference is that, this
time, the change in technology wasn’t
instituted by the industry itself, as it
was with the introduction of cassettes

It astounds me that it took so
damned long for the music industry to
really understand the '-

squirming around and

Ruckus Roboticus receives national acclaim

KATIE RIFE
THE Posr (OHIO U.)

(U-WIRE) “And just one day, I was
like, ‘I want to do music with
scratching,’ and I didn’t know any-
one who played turntables,” Dan
Haug, also known as DJ Ruckus
Roboticus, said, explaining why he
bought a set of turntables in high
school. Haug is best known in Athens
as a DJ for Dance or Die.

Haug is casual about his skill as a
DJ, but he’s been getting attention
for it lately, winning two national -
and international — DJ contests in
the same month. In early December,
he won first place in the Upload III
contest sponsored by Rockstar
Games, the video game company
famous as the creators of “Grand

Theft Auto.” The Upload III Web
site, www.rockstargames.com

“The Record Playa,” as a “frenzied
mix describing what it’s like to be a
‘record playa’  file under un—easy
listening.”

A copy of the same mix was also
chosen as the No. 1 mix of the year
by listeners of Solid Steel, a radio
show associated with Ninja Tune
Records and based in London.
Darren Knot, the show’s producer,
said Solid Steel receives mixes from
around the world, “from big—name
artists to bedroom DJ s.”

“Dan’s mix was exceptional and
totally encompassed what the show is
all about,” he said, “which is mixing
different styles of music together.”

“Just seeing my mix next to Kid

said.

Haug got into spinning records
five years ago when he was interest-
ed in composing experimental music.
He started
turntables, and eventually, “it just
took over,” he said. He practices for
at least a half an hour every day, and
said it takes him about six hours to
put together and practice a typical
Dance or Die set.

other people’s art, like collage,” he
said. “Taking something. ’someone"s
already done and making it my own.
So DJ,-ing applies perfectly to that.”

Haug is going to keep performing
after he graduates from Ohio
University this year, continuing “in
theory, forever.” The music might be
in a different form, however, because
in the future, he wants to spend more
time composing hisown music.

“I’ll find out if my hobbies will
become my day job,” he said. ~

Haug said he “probably” likes
playing live shows best because his
favorite part of being a DJ is inter-

The Forms may just rock your world at Mr. Roto’

’ With a Steve Albini—produced debut
album under their belt and an efferves-

cent fountain of critical adoration coming.

from all angles, The Forms have become
one of the most celebrated new acts to
come out of Brooklyn in the pastyear, a
credit to their lively stage performances
and their experimental songwriting.
Mysterious and quirky, its members

adopt aliases like “Aquaman,” and its

press release notes that a Catholic geolo-
gy teacher and a computer scientist help
comprise the band’s roster. In short,_ the
group’s sound could be described as a
ﬁeld study in the remaining possibilities
of the traditional rock palette: guitars,
bass and drums are thrown _around like
splatter paint, somehow landing on the
ears with beautiful precision. .
A Icarus, the band’s early 2003 debut,
is more of an instrumental brainstorm

. than a cohesive compilation of songs. Its

10 tracks span a mere 18 minutes, and its
songs defy the very concept of what a

song should be. They are void of verses,’

choruses, hooks and coherent lyrics. Few
of them last any longer than two minutes,
with one track being more than sufficient
with little more than 30 seconds of guitar
harmonics. But despite their seemingly
messy compositions, a brainy, mathemat-
ic audacity unveils itself.

The Offspring make a comeback    

Splinter
The Offspring

Columbia Records
‘2i‘n,‘r

Bands get older, and for most,
it’s a battle to keep younger listen-
ers listening to their music.

The Offspring have somehow
figured out how to steer around that.
They have gotten older but have
found‘ a way to keep their music
ringing in the ears of the youngsters,
as well as all of those fans who have.
been listening to them for the past
decade.

With their latest release,
Splinter, The Offspring looked back
onto their older material to try to
grasp a little of that ﬂavor. And
what they -pulled from the old, they
mixed nicely with the new.

Splinter has a feel to it that is
reminiscent of tracks from the
band’s 1994 release, Smash. The
album contains energetic rock songs
that have both humorand serious-
ness to the lyrics, much like their
smash-—-ehits “Come Out and Play
(Gotta Keep ‘em Separated)” and
“Self Esteem.”

On the new release, they sport
their first single, “Hit That,” which
has gotten The Offspring back on
the radio stations. But Splinter has
so much more that may or may not

find its way to radio.
Songs like “Worst Hangover

I Ever” and “When You’re in Prison”

are humorous tracks that keep the
album _ light-hearted. “Worst
Hangover Ever” may very well be
the anthem for the day after for col-
lege students worldwide. “I’ve got
the worst hangover everl I’m crawl-
ing to the bathroom again/ It hurts
so bad. that I’m never gonna drink
again.” - .

The album ends with “When
You’re in Prison,” a funny track that
is just guitar and vocals and record-
ed to sound very lo—fi, much like an

‘old record found in your parents’

attic. “When you’re in prison, don’t
pick up the soap, pick up the soap;
because it is bad for you/ When
you’re in prison, don’t pick up the
soap, pick up the soap; someone
will be waiting there for you.”
Other tracks on the album have a
darker feel. “The Noose”. and‘ “Spare
me the Details,” for example,’ are
less humorous ‘tracks. “The Noose,”

_-a song about death, is hauntingly
only feeling ‘

serious.’ “You’re
stronger cause you’re b‘ody’s getting
numbl Now I lay you down/ Put the
coins, in your eyes/ And. blow ‘th
candles out.” ’
“Spare me the Details” is an
acoustic track» reminiscent of
Weezer,about -a girlfriend getting
too drunk and sleeping with another

n

guy. “I’m_not the one who acted like
a ho/ Why must'I be the one who has
to know/ -I’m not the one who
messed up big time/ So. spare me the
details, if you don’t mind.”

Going back to their older style
of ‘mixing humor and gravity, The

Offspring have touched on some-
thing. They have also found some-
thing of a fountain of youth, at least
for a band trying to keep their fans
while appealing to new, younger
ones. '

Off the Wirei Ohio U. considers

LIA SESTRIC
THE Posr (OHIO U.)

(U-WIRE) - Although some people
are still enjoying the free file-sharing
networks available, recent reports
show many are switching to new,
legalized alternatives.

Programs such as Apple’s iTunes,
MusicMatch, RealOne and America
Online are all new, legal options for
music downloading. The program
iTunes offers gift vouchers and a par-
ent-controlled allowance feature so
that 12- to 17-year-olds, who typical-
ly don’t have credit cards, can choose

‘to use its legal service rather than

steal music.

A quarterly digital music behavior
report from Ipsos-Insight research
firm shows that 16 percent of
American music downloaders ages 12
and older — some 10 million people
— had paid to download the music
online.

The Recording ' Industry
Association of America has _been
going after illegal file-sharing net-
works and individuals of all ages, as

well as the popular file-sharing net-
work, Napster. .

Napster, now made legal after
previously being shut down following
efforts bythe RIAA, is contributing to
the movement for protecting music

artists’ and record companies’ rights ‘

by -teaming up with one American
university.

On Nov. 6, Pennsylvania State
University announced its ‘agreement
with the online music service Napster,
becoming the first university in ‘the
nation to offer its student body a legal
alternative for downloading music.

The -Penn State agreement is
worthwatching, said Ohio University
President Robert Glidden. . _

“The university definitely has the
responsibility to monitor and to stop
illegal activities,” he said. “What’s
difficult is educating people, not just
what the legalities are but what the
ethics are of this.” i
V With the Penn State—Napster
agreement, the cost of downloading
music is included in students’ tech-
nology fee. They will be able to freely
download music from a library of

responses to illegal file-sharing

more than 500,000 songs and will
have other features available to them.

-Students can choose to purchase

downloads to CDs or other devices
for 99 cents per track. ‘ ,
“I_ would use a program like this
at our school because it would be eas-
ier to download music as well as be
legal_ and not have to worry about
viruses,” said OU audio production
freshman Dustin Ford.” ‘ a
Before considering" something
like this for OU, Glidden said he

would question if students at Penn,

State will comply and, pay 99 cents
per song, and how Penn State will
monitor the program to ensure that it
is occurring.

“There needs to be some mecha-
nism to make this thing work,”
Glidden said, “but in order for it to be
fair, there has to be some way to mon-
itor it.” .

This school year, OU has consid-
ered monitoring computers, because

V T1 lines — the university’s Internet

pipeline — have been constantly tied
up by students leaving their comput-
ers running and downloading. This

causes the university to lose money.

“If someone is using the comput-
er more than what seems reasonable
for educational purposes, we’ll start
charging them,” Glidden said.

The RIAA has been persistent in
targeting individuals for illegal music
downloading, and eventually may be

prosecuting institutions. This will *0

occur if the institutions are not coop-
erating and do not educate the stu-
dents and police the situation,
Gliddensaid. ’

Illegal file-sharing takes up a lot
of Internet bandwidth because stu-
dents download music that is being
shared with everyone else, said -Sean
O’Malley, public relations’ manager of
Communication Network Services.
Students using a legal music program
would not affect the bandwidth as
much. i ‘

The Pitt men’s basketball team
will travel outside the city limits for

j the first time in nearly two months

when it plays at Miami on Saturday
afternoon. V

, Coming off a 78-59 victory over‘
.Virginia Tech on Tuesday evening,

the No. 15 Panthers look to improve

their conference record to 2-0 while

maintaining their unbeaten streak.
Against the _ Hokies, senior

guards J aron Brown and Julius Page _
.led Pitt with 21 and 20 points,
- respectively. Freshman forward

Chris Taft chipped in 17 points to
help the Panthers improve their

_’ recordto '15-O. Brown also played,-A

tough defense against‘ Virginia
’Tech’s leading scorer Bryant
Matthews, holding him to 22 points,
two below his average.

_“We"knew [Matthews] was
going to take a bunch of shots,”
Brown said. “We just tried to get a
hand in his face and contest his
shots.”

-Head coach Jamie Dixon praised

‘Brown, who scored" the 1,000th

point of his career during the game,
for his basketball sense‘ and quick-
ness; ~

“He has a knack for finding the

ball,” Dixon said. “He’s a step

Senior guard J aron Brown looks to make a pass during Pitt’s 78-59 victory over

Virginia Tech Tuesday night. - A

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

This year’s’ Pitt gymnastics
team willilook to its senior class to
provide the leadership needed to

‘ ensure improvement.

The team returns nine letter-

' winners and will be looking to fin- ,

ish higher than last y-ear’s 7-19
mark. Top returning letter-winners

include seniors Alyse Zeffiro,
-A Diandra O’Connor, and Erika”
Goldberg,

Zeffiro was named to the A11-
EAGL First Team for balance beam
and ﬂoor exercises, as well, as the
All-EAGL Second Team for the

vault. She also set ‘a school record»

last year, posting a 9.95 in the floor
exercise. ' »
O’Connor boasted a 38.785

average in the all-around, while
Goldberg averaged a 9.779 on the
ﬂoor exercise.

Despite the individual acco-
lades, head coach Debbie Yohman
says that it is up to the senior class
as a whole, not any one individual,
to. set the tone and lead by example.

"Yohman said that, right now,
she is cautiously optimistic about
the team’s chances. A

“If we can avoid some of the
pitfalls thatsnagged us up last year,
we’ll be" fine,” Yohman said. “Bars
are much better than they were last
year, but vaulting is maybe a little
questionable. We were worried
about floor, but it looked good in
our intersquad meet last week.”

Yohman’s biggest concern is
with consistency in the team’s

depth. She hesitantly described the

Pitt looks to improve this season

freshmen. gymnasts as immature,
but said that it was more of a matter
of them buying into the system.
“Theeveterans have made the
changes that they’ve needed to
make,” Yohmansaid. “The fresh-
men have been working very hard,
but need to work on being more
consistent. The senior class leads

this team. It is a large and talented '

group. They’ve had many ups and
downs and are finally where they

«need to be.”

Yohman has her team perform-
ing not only in the gym, but in the
classroom as well. ‘Eight gymnasts

earned NACGC/W Scholastic All—‘~~

America Honors. And the team’s
3.45 GPA is ranked 13th in the
nation and No. 1' on Pitt’s campus.

Gymnastics, page 14

Panthers will
exceed critics’
expectations

 

Former Pitt guard Brandin Knight
graduated and ex—Panther head coach
Ben Howland stiffed the program for
his “dream job” at UCLA at the end of
the 2002-03 ‘men’s basketball season.

Now -Jamie Dixon is the coach,
and the team features a freshman in
the starting lineup. So Pitt should
revert back to the struggling program
that it was for several years prior to
the Howland Era, right?

Wrong.

The No. 15-ranked Panthers are
not that much different than the teams
from the past two seasons. There are
obviously some noticeable absences
—— former Pitt players Ontario Lett
and Donatas- Zavackas graduated

along with Knight.
But this team still has the same
philosophy —. they play tough

defense, and it is someone different
every night who elevates his game in
order to help Pitt win. Sophomore
guard Carl Krauser has taken Knight’s

_ place this season and is actually aver-

aging more points per game than
Knight’s 11.2 points per game last
season. '

Krauser is averaging 15.6 points
per game, which is the same number
of points that Knight averaged in his
junior year. But Knight’s leadership
on the court can’t be questioned, and
quite naturally, Krauser needs more
experience to match that.

The thing that is so impressive,

about this team is their resilience. On
Tuesday night, Pitt went into its game
against Virginia Tech without
Krauser, who is their main ball han-
dler. Things were shaky at first —
freshman guard . Antonio . Graves

‘ turned the ball over three times in the

first half, which allowed Virginia
Tech to hang around longer than they
should have.

Philadelphia Eagles will be one-and—done in playoffs

  

   

People. It feels so good to be
back. After an eight-month hiatus,

-the Israeli Rebel is back and better

than ever. I want to make my come-
back with something rash and aus-
tere. Iwant to stir up some contro-
versy and get people reallyriled up,
or maybe make some people really
love me. So here we go.

My first bold statement of 2004
is that the Philadelphia ‘Eagles will
lose to the Green Bay Packers on
Sunday. Wait, before all you Philly
fans go get your guns and knives to
kill me, hear me out. I don’t want to

get» any hate e—mail or phone calls "

or any response whatsoever until
Sunday night. If the Eagles win, I’ll
take all the hate e—mail that you can
give me.

But when the. Packers win, I
only want responses praising my
wonderful ability to predict profes-
sional football games. Face it,
Philadelphia; this is the one team in‘
the playoffs that. can beat the

Eagles. You know it.‘I know it.’ The ‘

country knows it.

So why, exactly, do I believe the
Eagles will lose? I could go through
the whole destiny thing, saying that

Super Bowl after losing his father a
few weeks back. I could even go as
far to say that there is an angel on
the Packers’ side after
Arizona successfully win on a Hail
Mary to bump Green bay into the
playoffs.

Then, the heck with angels, God‘

was on the Packers’ side last week,
letting Al Harris intercept a pass by
Matt Hasselback andreturn it for a
touchdown in overtime to force the
Philly-Green Bay matchup this
week. I’m even thanking Detroit for
beating St. Louis in week 17,

‘because by doing that, the Eagles

got the No. 1 seed, forcing the
matchup of the Eagles and Packers
this weekend.

So, why will Philly lose? Well,
Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, and
people in Pittsburgh, as well as
those in Philadelphia, know that
sports teams in this area love to get
your hopes up, then lose before get-
tingto the championship game.

But -‘no, all you Philly fans
believe Donovan McNabb is a saint.
He can’t lose to Green Bay. He is
going to win the Super Bowl this

year. Wait, weren’t you booing this

guy when he was drafted and after

the Eagles started off 0-2? Oh yeah,
I bet you forgot about that. You
have been too busy booing Santa
Claus lately.

So for my friend Matt Milo, I
say this. McNabb is just like
Kordell Stewart. He is a pretty good
quarterback who will never get
Philly to the Promised Land. When
has McNabb won the big game?
Never. He has yet to get
Philadelphia to where they should
be.

Yohman said that it is no coinci-
dence that her team performed so
well scholastically.

“Strong students are what we
recruit,” Yohman said.

The team has been putting in 20
hours per week for the last four full
months. And because of the physi-
cal demands, gymnasts spend a lot
of time in the training room going

through rehab.

“Since way back in September,
we’ve been putting in our hours,”
Yohman said. “We’re excited to see
how we do, and we’re excited about
our home schedule.”

The gymnastics team opens its
season this Saturday at Ohio State,
where the Panthers will take on the
Buckeyes and the Maryland
Terrapins in a three-team competi-
tion.

Toree Morris.

The Panthers enter Saturday’s
game looking for their fifth consec-
utive road victory, dating back to
last season. Redshirt sophomore
guard Carl Krauser remains listed as
day-to—day with a pulled groin,
which may force freshman guard
Antonio Graves into seeing extend-
ed playing time. Graves scored
seven points and dished out five
assists in 29 minutes against
Virginia Tech, despite six turnovers.

“He’s a great kid and he had a
great practice [on Monday],” Dixon
said about Graves. “It’s a great sign
of maturity for a freshman player to
overcome some early struggles and
play a good game.”

The last time Pitt played at
Miami, in January of 2002, it lost
76-69. The Panthers avenged their
loss against Miami in the 2002 Big
East Tournament, but this year’s
game will be a significant harbinger
of the rest of the Panthers’ season,
since it will be their first road con-
test in a hostile environment.

Nevertheless, Page is aware of
the challenges that accompany the
Panthers’ Big East schedule.

“Each team you play [in the Big
East] is a good team, and that’s just
how the Big East Conference is,”
Page said.

Tip-off is scheduled for 2 p.m.
and will be televised on FOX
Sports.

Pitt is made up of different cast
but concept is still the same

Nocks, page 11

But seniors Jaron Brown and

Julius Page stepped -up their game and

contributed 21 and 20 points, respec-
tively. These are two players who
don’t average 15 points per game, but
they stepped up and nearly doubled
their typical point totals. That is senior
leadership and a great example for

‘ players such as Graves, who eventual-

ly settled down and even hit a couple
of shots. It appeared that their
resilience even rubbed off on him.
Then there is freshman center‘
Chris Taft. What can you say about
him? He does not have the experience
that Lett did, but he is taller, at 6 feet
10 inches compared to Lett’s 6-foot-6-

’ inch frame, and actually stays out of
foul trouble, which will be huge as the ‘

schedule gets tougher down the
stretch. ’ I " . 4

Against Virginia Tech, Taft scored
a career-high 17 points and appeared
to be veil-y comfortable as a starter --
he was able to score several baskets

A while being double-teamed. He also

contributed four blocks, four
rebounds, and a steal.
On defense, the Panthers still

swarm to the balland play physically.

In the second half, Pitt’s defense made
a few adjustments and held the Hokies.
to 26 points, compared to 33 points in
the first half. . ‘
Opposing teams were averaging
53.4 points against Pitt going into
Tuesday night’s game, compared to a
school-record—low 59.2 points
allowed per game, which was set by
last year’s squad. But the Panthers
still have a lot to prove, as they have
not really played tough competition.
Defense will be the key in evalu-
ating this year’s squad. Can they keep
up their caliber of playon defense?

Krauser’s ability to run the offense’

effectively and Graves’ ability to con-
tribute valuable minutes without tak-
ing anything away from the Panthers’
attack will also be crucial.

The team consists of players like
Page, Brown, Krauser and Chevon
Troutman, along with some youth.
Even though some of the players have
changed, the concept is still the same.
A lot of people donot think much of
Pitt, but look out, because this team
will still be one to be reckoned with
this season. ’

Playoff teamshave noticeable trends

Goldman, page 13

reason the Eagles will lose is the
Packers’ two—headed monster. Favre
is due for a bad game, I know. But,
the Eagles are going to be so
focused on Ahman Green that Favre
won’t have to play especially well
to win. Hepis going to be facing sin-
gle coverage most of the game, and
Favre’s receivers are good enough
to go get the ball in man coverage.

When Green Bay and Philly met
earlier in the year, Green ran 'for
almost 200 yards. This will force
the Eagles to play with eight men in
the ‘box. If the secondary backs up,
then Green will run wild. They
move in, and Favre will throw for
ridiculous numbers.

For the Eagles, McNabb is
good, but he can’t account for the
loss of Brian Westbrook. I know the
Eagles have two other decent backs,
but only one team in the history of
the NFL (the New York Jets) has
ever won a playoff game with their
leading rusher on the sidelines.

The Eagles.aren’t just hurt on
offense; their defense took two big
blows. Troy Vincent is listed as

questionable for Sunday. If he

plays, one can_ only imagine how
good he can be with his hip injury.
The other Eagle that is injured is

linebacker Carlos Emmons. With
Emmons out, Favre will have more
time to throw, be able to throw
down the middle, and get more run-
ning room for Green.

Then there is Harris, a former
Eagle, who will not only be looking
to have a big performance against
his old team, but will be riding high
off his winning interception from
last week. The whole Packers
defense will be riding high after
last week.

The winner of this game will be
the team that doesn’t give up the
big play. Both these teams blitz and
take risks in the secondary. It will
be a great matchup, b_ut I believe
the Packers have ‘away-too-= many
weapons and way too much on their
side to lose this game.

Plus, have you noticed the trend
of teams playing each other for the
second time in the playoffs? The
Colts beat the Broncos after loosing
to them in the regular season, and
the Panthers beat the Cowboys who
had beaten them in the regular sea-
son. I’m just saying, look out
Philadelphia, here come the Pack.

Brian Goldman is a staff writer for
The Pitt News and wants Green Bay
to win just so the Philadelphia peo-
ple at Pitt will shut up.

“SMART FALL”

Choosing a place to live is difficult but very
important and deserves the investment of your
time. We suggest you compare numerous
apartments, check out the reputations of the
landlords, and talk to the existing tenants when
the landlord is not there. To start you off on
the “right” track, call our number (24 hours)
and leave your name and address ( and your
parents?) so that we may mail you detailed
information for your consideration.
