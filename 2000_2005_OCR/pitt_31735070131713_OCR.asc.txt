“We don’t know what’s going to hap-

hospital workers in the Pittsburgh area

_ have already encountered major increases
in the cost of health care. She said she
attended the rally to increase awareness
among employers who are “pricing people
out of health care.”

“I know some people who have to
work two jobs to get health care,” Cleary
said. “Lots of people employed in health

Cappynominated Board of Trustees chair

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Pennsylvania Supreme
Court Chief Justice and Pitt
Board of Trustees member
Ralph Cappy put himself in a
vulnerable position last
January, but it doesn’t seem to
have hurt his reputation.

Cappy,- who has served on
Pitt’s board since 1992, wrote
a letter to the editor of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
defending the Board’s deci-
sion to give large‘ raises to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and other top Pitt executives
during a time of tuition
increases and economic pes-
simism. .

On Tuesday, June 10, the
Board’s Nominating
Committee nominated Cappy
to lead the trustees as chair of
the board. Cappy would
replace William Dietrich, who
has served as chair for three
years, including one year as
chair—elect. Dietrich will
remain an active member of
the Board.

The Board of Trustees is
responsible for, among other
things, making essential deci-
sions to advance Pitt and pro-
tect its freedom and integrity.
Although the board delegates
authority to Pitt’s chancellor
and chief executive officer,
the 36 voting members of the

board retain ultimate responsi-

bility for University affairs,
according to Pitt’s rules of
governance. ’

The board shouldered the
negative side of that responsi-
bility, with public criticism
and the disapproval of — the
Faculty Assembly, when it
approved the salary increases.
The increases, which included
a 14 percent raise for
Nordenberg, were determined
after a professional consulta-
tion firm surveyed executives’
salaries at peer universities.

Cappy publicly defended
N ordenberg and explained the
Board’s decision in his letter
to the editor; In spite of public

criticism from students, who

~ . . V . -

tuition increase the previous
year, and staff, many of whom
received minimal
increases, Vice Chancellor for

Public Affairs Robert Hill did

not indicate a connection
between Cappy’s nomination
and his letter, which described
Nordenberg’s resistance to
receiving a salary increase.

The letter led the Faculty
Assembly to request that the
Board “give greater heed in
the future to the chancellor’s
concern.”

Sworn in as chief justice
in January this year,’ Cappy

degree in psychology in 1965

CGS students work, raise
families and attend classes

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

After 15 years in the U.S. Navy,
Charles Ritz is looking forwardto
teaching and settling down in
Malaysia.

The small catch is that he never
graduated from college and has
never taught in a classroom setting.

The middle—aged former service-
man has now returned to school as
one of about 3,000 students enrolled
in Pitt’s College of General Studies.

CGS students — mostly non-tra-
ditional students —— have lifestyles or
schedules that make attending school
more difficult for them than for tra-
ditional students. Often older, they
might have a full-time job, children
or a commitment to the military,
according to Trina Walker, the direc-
tor of marketing for CGS.

Ritz, who has completed 15 cred-
its, hopes to continue his public ser-
vice by becoming a not—for-profit
teacher in Malaysia, his wife’s home
country, after he graduates from Pitt
with his bachelor’s and master’s
degrees.

Having a wife and a young
daughter makes his situation a bit
difficult. Ritz leaves for work at 8:30
a.m. and does not return home until
after 9 p.m., when he has finished
classes. But he said he knows his
hard work will help his family live a
better life later. A J

“I find whenever _I look at my
daughter —— who’s not but two -—
any motivation [is] there,” he said.

Unlike Ritz, Nancy Kirkwood
Raynovich had experience in her
field before going back to school.
Also‘ a CGS student, she had no plans
to return to school until she separat-
ed from her husband.

“Life had been pretty full until
then,” she said, explaining why she
had not thought about going back to
school earlier.‘

Both students said their families’
support has been essential in main-
taining their new schedules.
According to Ritz, he could not have
made or stuck to his decision to go
back to school without his wife.

Kirkwood Raynovich studied
English writing, with a focus on
poetry, at Pitt before she left to
marry and raise a family, which now
includes three daughters, ranging in
ages from 11 to 15. She added that
she has become an example for her
daughters because she believes
women need to be independent,
financially and otherwise.

Kirkwood Raynovichwasa stay-.

at-home mom, so her return to school
was a “big shock” to her children,
who had to adjust to not having their
mom there for everything, she said.
Now they are excited to see her grad-
uate next year.

Originally, she attempted to take
classes during the day, while her
children were also at school. She ran
into a problem with teachers who
allowed students to miss only a few
classes each semester, because she
had to miss class whenever her chil-
dren were sick and home from
school. '

Going back to school later inlife
gave Kirkwood Raynovich an oppor-
tunity to focus on herself more. She
added that if she’d had the same
focus years ago, she would have
worked while raising her children. »

1 Until two years ago, Kirkwood
Raynovich had not been in school for
about 20 years, although she contin-
ued writing poetry and received
awards for it during those years.
S_ince‘returning, she has decided to
focus on a career in freelance maga-
zine writing.

Being in classes with students
much younger than she is has been a
culture shock, she said. When she
first returned to school, there were
more students in her classes who
were her age, especially women in
situations» similar to hers. -

gAs her classes became more spe-
cialized, she said, the number of
older students dropped. Some people
she went to school with years ago are
now professors at Pitt, ‘and, this past
year, her niece became a freshman at
Pitt.

“Culturally, it’s weird,” she said.

People at Pitt have told Ritz that
age does not matter, he said, but he

realizes that it is much easier for »

someone to go to school as a 20-
year-old than as a 40-year-old with a
family to raise. 8

For that reason, he,had reserva-
tions about going back to school,
particularly with no official back-
ground in his field of study.

“Believe me, I wish I could take
time to smell the roses,” he said.

Finishing school when she was
younger would have been easier,
Kirkwood Raynovich said, but it was
difficult to realize that at the time.

Sitting in classrooms and over-
hearing students about 20 years old
talk about their problems and makes
her realize that college life is usually
quite stress-free.

“It’s ‘so relaxed,” she said of ,a ,-

college student’s lifestyle. “It’s noth-

.ing like life}? .A L .

protesters say they’ll keep fighting

Rally page 1

Pitt service workers and city janitors were
other members and employees of the Union,
as well as sympathizers and other support-
ers.

Billie Terry, the widow of a former vice
president of a local chapter of the SEIU,
spent part of her birthday participating in the
demonstration /for affordable family health
insurance.

“I have health care, but low-income
people don’t,” said Terry, who, like many of
the protesters, canied a large sign with a pic-
ture of a Pitt service worker’s family-—— the
people who might lose their health care cov-
erage under the new plan.

“It’s all part of the same mindset -—
keep the poor people down,” Terry said.

Ken Love, a rally participant, added that
his message was directed at politicians.

“A nation is judged by the way it takes
care of its elderly and its young,” he said.

Calling the rising price of health care a
“moral violation against mankind,” he said
he frequently participates in rallies and
protests. .

“Our CEOS are responsible [for the
problem], but they have to be forced by the
law to do right,” Love said, blaming
Ame1ica’s political leaders for not regulating
health care costs.

State Sen. Jay Costa Jr. (D), who did not
attend the rally, said he believes Pitt will ﬁnd
a viable solution. V

“I have to put faith in the people on both
sides of the negotiating table,” Costa said,
adding that he believes Pitt’s leaders will
make good decisions. \‘”I‘hings are tough —-—
the economy’s very tough right now.”

State Sen Jim Ferlo (D), whose statf
reported he was at the rally, could not be
reached for comment.

Justice for Janitors Day, a national day

of action for SEIU janitors in America, com-
memorates a rally of janitors in Los Angeles
about 10 years ago. Although the Los
Angeles rally began peacefully, the mood
changed when police attacked the janitors,
beating some badly, according to Tom
Hoffman, the SEIU spokesman.

Pittsburgh police monitoring Friday’s
rally did not interact with ﬂue protesters,
except to keep them out of the building’s
lobby. SEIU labor lawyer Cindy Goldstein,
who regularly brings her young son, Ben, to
SEIU protests, said the protesters and the
police generally interact well.

“Overall, the police have been very
sympathetic. Most of them are in unions and
are facing the same issues,” Goldstein said,
while Ben giggled and played a harmonica
to join in the noise of the protesters. A

Goldstein added that the police treated
the SEIU protesters like they would anyone
else, regardless of sympathy they might feel
for the group. ~

“For the most part, it’s i11formational,”

.Goldstein said of the rally. “It’s designed to

be confrontational, but not in an aggressive
way.”

_ As the protest concluded in the median
of the busy Downtown intersection in front
of Fifth Avenue Place, near the Point, the
group began chanting, “We’ll be back.” A
man with a megaphone spoke of the contin-
uod battle lying ahead, and the protesters
nodded and clapped when he said the
protests would continue until the workers
received affordable health care.

Until then, workers like Thomas will
either rely on state—fundcd health care pro-
grams for their children or go without any
coverage at all.

“I don’t think they care about the little
people,” Thomas said of politicians and cor-
porate leaders, “because if they did, we
wouldn’t be here now.”

Many nominees are corporate leaders _

Trustees, page 1

and from Pitt’s law school in 1968.

“Cappy is somebody that’s been’

very dedicated to the University’ of
Pittsburgh,” Pennsylvania State ‘Sen.
Jay Costa said. “For such a young man

to be chief of the [State] Supreme ,

Court — he’s always performed
exceptionally well.’’

Cappy will turn 60 in August,
which means he can serve 10 more
years as chief justice before reaching
the mandatory retirement age of 70.

As chief justice, Cappy could face
a conflict of interest if any state court
case involving Pitt, such as the same-
sex beneﬁts case against Pitt, reached
the state supreme court. But both
Costa and Hill expressed faith that
Cappy would respond appropriately
and not preside over such a case if the
situation arose.

“If any case involving Pitt reached
the court in ways that would represent
any potential conﬂict, the judge would
handle himself accordingly,” Hill said,
adding that Pitt has no pending cases
before Cappy, and that he doubts the
justice will face such a situation.

. In addition to Cappy, the nominat-
ing board suggested the election of
fivenew members for the Board of
Trustees, as well as the re-election of
five current trustees, including Cappy.
Most nominees are corporate leaders.

The full board will act on the nom-
inations at its meeting on Thursday,
June 19.

“Ex officio” trustees —-— members
of the board who no longer have vot-

Helmet laws may fall by the wayside

The Pennsylvania Senate voted 29-
20 on Monday to repeal the state’s 35-
year-old motorcycle hehnet law. The new
bill, which would require only riders age
21 and younger and those with less than
two years riding experience to wear pro-
tective headgear, unless they take a state-
run motorcycle safety course, is now

headed for the House. Governor Ed-

Rendell says he’ll sign it into law if the
legislature approves it. ’

If the new bill passes, it will be a
great stride for our backward, patemalis-
tic state. Pennsylvania is notorious for
interfering in the affairs of its citizens, and
allowing bikers to make their own deci-

sions regarding personal safety would be

a huge step forward.

Unlike laws prohibiting driving
under the inﬂuence of chemicals, the law
requiring anyone on a motorcycle in
Pennsylvania to wear a hehnet is arbitrary
and meddlesome.

A biker without a helmet poses no
more of a threat to others in anaccident
than a helmeted biker. A driver, on the
other hand, is responsible for all the pas-
sengers in the car and can easily endanger
others on the road by not being restrained.

It’s a common saying among bikers.
that they come in two types: those who’ve
crashed, and those who haven’t yet.
Motorcyclists have no illusions that theirs
is the safest mode of transportation. It’s a
dangerous hobby, much like rock climb-
ing or bungee jumping, and those who

enjoy it come into the sport well informed
of the dangers. If they pose no threat to
others, however, it should be up to them
to make an informed decision to wear
protective gear or not.

The case could be made that hehnets
impede safety; they certainly detract from
visibility- and hearing. Regardless, the

decision belongs in the hands — and
Vi heads — of riderstlremselves. i

While the number 21 may be arbi-
trary  after all, 18-year-old citizens are
expected to vote, pay taxes and possibly
serve their country as adults in allways
except raising a toast to their great state
—— it’s a wise idea to impose an age
restriction on the privilege to go helmet-
less on a hog.

VV1th agecomes experience and judg-

' ment. Mature adults should be able to
mindfully take risks with their own health '

and well-being. Adults often make rules
for children with “I say so” as the stated
rationale and a child’s safety as the true
reason. In this scenario, the state isn’t
being unfair to impose rules on the young
for their own good. -

Requiring riders to have two years of
experience can be seen as a ‘rite of pas-
sage, something to aspire to. It can be an
obvious mark of experience, a way to dis-
tinguish skilled riders from neophytes.

If Pennsylvania keeps up this trend of
having rational laws and repealing offi-
cious ones, what could be next? Liquor
on Sundays?

Waifishness irrelevant ‘to war heroism

During every war, the-media yearns for
a hurnan-interest story. As weapons become
more mechanical and battle more imperson-
al, there is an urge to put a face on a cause, to
give the abstractions of war — courage, pain
and hope — a symbol. ‘

In the Iraqi conﬂict,
Jessica Lynch, a 20-year-old
West Virginian private first
class, is that symbol. Since her
rescue from an Iraqi hospital,
the media has surrounded
Lynch with a deluge of hype.
Her story is told in jump—Cuts,
stitched together from sources
reliable and not, and custom-
polished by a press eager to
make this woman, so often

Opinions Editor

and not something that withers and folds.
Lynch’s ordeal was just that: an ordeal.

It takes guts to go through whatever she did

— for her story has been subject to multiple

revisions —- and survive. Being injured
severely in an unfamiliar country where you
wereboth welcomed and hated

would be terrifying. Bitch
Magazine, one of my favorite
outlets for wholesale, um,
bitching, has a list where peo-
ple post...comp1aints about the
media. One stated that media
coverage, particularly ' the
Newsweek cover story in
which Lynch was featured,
_, turned her“into little morethanl
a marketable symbol of

described as “waif-like,” into a
symbol of wholesomeness and bravery.‘

As the details of her capture and rescue
are revealed, I believe that the courage the
media ascribed to her is true. It’s the rest of it
that I don’t believe. I like descriptions. They
are whatturncatching aﬁsh into harpooning
Moby Dick’s little brother. Yet if the words
waif-like are mentioned in conjunction with
Jessica Lynch again, I’m going Dog Day
Afternoon. A '

Waif-like is more than a physical
description. It indicates weakness, frailness,
a tendency towards pallet and big, searching

_ eyes. These are not -attributes ﬁtting with

Lynch’s actions. .

Lynch went through boot camp. She
marched all over the desert. She sustained
severe injuries when her Humvee collided
with a tractor-trailer. There were bone frag-

ments sticking through her skin. She-

received medical care that one of her Iraqi
doctors admitted to The Washington Post, in
a June 17 article, was “substandard”

These details do notaddup to aquaking
ﬂower. If the United States’ viewing and

reading audiences want to hear about the-
girl-next-door’s rescue, then they’re going to .

have to accept that next door lives a soldier

, _ American virtue,” raﬂier than
the “bona ﬁde war hero” she should be por-
trayed as. . ‘

Lynch was no Andromeda, chained
helplessly to a rock, about to be devoured by.
a sea monster until Perseus rescued her.‘

jMythology is full of rescues, epic efforts,

and the maiden falling into the bulging anns
of hero. '

But Lynch’s’ story should not be A
. mythologized before it is told accurately. »
The Washington Post printed a long article ,

recounting this happening’s reporting and
misreporting, saying that much of her report-_
ed trauma was embellished and exaggerated
This doesn’t detract from Lynch’s courage; it
merely raises -questions about the press’

credibility. ’

Shouldn’t going into war, being wound- ‘

ed and living through it be enough? Why
sentimentalize, editorialize and assign ill-ﬁt-
ting descriptions? Why must she be waif-
liketo be sympaﬂietic, or passive to be
rewarded with coverage? If we want some-
one to represent our ideals, he or she must be
portrayed accurately.

Financial independence: acircle filled with squares

Every night, I say the following prayer:

Most high God, Jesus of jack rabbits,
Jesus of grace, please, when I wake up, let
my mattress be stuffed with Benjamins.
And, please, bless the money, make it clean
and non—sequential, spare me from having

they may never be able to open their bill-

Pain was expected, but not indifference to the sport

Somewhere around the 22nd
mile, I stopped wanting to run.

Pain, stress and a packed sched-
ule couldn’t cure me of my running
addiction, but a marathon almost did.

I expected the pain before I
began the race. After all, the first
marathon runner, who completed the
26.2 miles in ancient Greece,
promptly keeled over dead, as my
boyfriend reminded me whenever he
could. -
But I’ve dealt with pain. I ran
track in high school and "did horrible,
frequently running-related things to
my body.

Growing up as a Calvinist, I
adopted the philosophy that strug-

gling and suffering could make me a,

better person. ‘

Even if I’ve grown to the point
where I can question my childhood
philosophy, I figured I could take
whateyer the marathon could give
me.-

Except indifference to the sport
itself. ’

When my body began telling me
to walk, or to give up and wait for
the truck —— for people who dropped
out of the race — to come and pick
me up, I didn’t consider quitting
because of the pain shooting up my
legs and neck.

I wanted to give up because I
wasn’t sure if I really cared about
running. ,

I finished the race. I didn’t want
to ride home as a quitter after all the
teasing I’d taken from friends who
couldn’t understand why I would
want to run for four hours. -

But, when the thought
of drinking the complimen-
tary Yuengling offered to
runners around the 23rd
mile marker turned my
stomach, I knew I was in
trouble.

Concerned, beer-loving
readers need not worry —

I made up for my mid-
race temperance later.

My appetite for run-
ning has yet‘ to recover. .

I’ve heard of people who, in
bouts of youthful naivete, consumed
a pound of chocolate or a gallon of
soda in one sitting and have never
been able to stomach the food or bev-
erage since. \

My parents survived on canned
mackerel for a year while my dad
was in grad school .— fortunately,
before my time — and my mom still
can’t_handle the smell of the conve-
niently packed fish.

.runs, culminating in 22 miles of fun
_and 4.2 miles of hating myself,

maybe I just overdosed on running.

Fortunately for my friends and

my mom, none of them -ever defined

themselves by chocolate, soda or
mackerel. While I’d like to think my

pletely rooted in my
daily running ritual, it’s
not far from the truth. ' 
I Running pleases my
Calvinist soul.

It’s cheap and ‘simple
—— give me proper shoes
and a sports bra, and I

can do -it. anywhere. It

requires hard work and -
dedication. If .I’m
lucky, it’s inconve-

nient, difficult and painful. We
Calvinists consider that a bonus.

It sets me apart and occasionally
makes trouble, and I’m ashamed to
admit that I kind of enjoy that. My
religious sensibility tells- me that
something is worth doing only if it
involves climbing a" tricky, thorny
path. ,

» Maybe it comes from growing up
in a brown church, with the increas-
ing sense that I am probably not on
the list of the 160,000 faithful souls
that John Calvin’s, God- plans to

sense of being isn’t com—‘

redeem.
Realizing that I might not like

running anymore makes me feel like 3

‘a’ Catholic schoolgirl who’s realized
she doesn’t really believe in God‘. .
I’m pretty scared by the possibil-

ity of not liking something that pro- 3

vides the basis of who I am and what
I do. I guess my case is reasonably

mild, compared to other undesirable

addictions on which I might have
based my identity. - '

But as someone who’s completed 3

several year-and-a-half streaks with-

out missing a day of running,-.I’m '

intimidated by the gaping Void that
would replace my morning runs.

At this point, I’m still running
every day, but I think I’m getting
used to the idea that I might not be a
horrible person if I stop. Maybe, as-
the aches weareoff, I’ll get back to
the peace and self-awareness that I
used to find while running. .

Or maybe I’ll find that I like
sleeping in the extra hour.

J.‘ Elizabeth Strohm realizes that
John Calvin would probably. not
approve,of her public exhibition of
skin and sweatiness while running,
so it’s a good thing she’s not really

doing it for him. Share yourwisdom

  Quiet
Exhibit helps kick off
the “Summer of Andy”

‘Where is Elvis? The Man

and His Reflection
Through Aug. 31

The Andy Warhol Museum
117 Sandusky Street
(412) 237-8300

_ DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A & E Editor

America is a nation with a history of
unhealthy fascination with celebrities,
whether stars of stage, screen or music.

But few stars are as important to the
American cultural ‘ landscape‘ as Elvis
Presley. From his hip~shaking appear-
ance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” to well
beyond his death, The King has driven
hordes of people to obsess over him,
including pop artist Andy Warhol, who
printed large, silver silkscreens of
Elvis”? ‘ ‘

It’s only appropriate, then, that
“Where is Elvis? The Man’ and His
Reﬂection,” an exhibition of Elvis pho-
tographs from his first days as a rock ‘n’
roller through his enlistment in the
Army, is housed at The Andy Warhol
Museum and kicks off the “Summer of
Andy,” a celebration of what would have

been Warhol’s 75th birthday.

Elvis photographs from numerous
photographers, including Alfred
Wertheimer, Gabi Rona, Roger

Marshutz, Robert Stinnett and Norman
Bergsma are located on the first ﬂoor of
the museum, in a room graced by
Warhol’s own “Elvis (Eleven Times).”

Vifith an eye toward showing Elvis
as the star, constantly in front of the cam-
era both onstage and backstage, his
appearances on “The Ed Sullivan
Show,” “The Steve Allen Show” and at
state fairs are all documented. There are
also photos showing Elvis away from the
limelight — rehearsing with musicians,
taking a breather at home or carousing
with a couple of the many girls who
caught his shows and his fancy.

But what these photographs also
capture, and what makes these images
far more fascinating than a mere docu-
ment of a rock star persona as large as
Elvis, is the god-like status his fans
attributed to him and the toll it took on
him and his family.

"*3

“I don ’t know anything about music. In my line, you don ’t have to.” —— Elvis Presley

your suspicious minds

As disturbing as this
image is, a series of two
photographs taken by dif-
ferent photographers
paints an even bleaker,
more heartbreaking pic-
ture of Elvis’ career.

The first is an image
titled “Clean Underwear

t One of the first images in the collec-
tion is a photograph dating from 1955-56

-by Stinnett, titled “Untitled (Elvis on

chair with fans leaning over balcony).”
Elvis is the smallest object in this image,
sitting on a chair offstage with an excit-
ed look on his face, ﬂanked by numerous
security guards. Seven
young girls, holding pic-
tures for Elvis to sign,
lean over a railing, look-
ing for the rock star. There
is a great distance
between the viewer and
The King, despite the
vastness of the open space i
of the stage, the open door
and Elvis’ good-natured
look inviting us closer.
Contrast that image
with a photo even further
down the Elvis timeline,
taken by Marshutz in ,‘ A _ 
1956, titled “Elvis Presley ‘ '  1

. in Tupelo, Mississippi.” Taken at nearly

the same time as the Stinnett image,
Marshutz captures how high the star rose
in mere months. A

In the image, Elvis is the largest
object in the frame. His band, buildings
in the background and things like tele-
phone poles and light posts are insigniﬁ-
cant against the stature of The King, who
is singing to a throng of fans with arms

     

outstretched. Unlike in the Stinnett
photo, we are uncomfortably close to

-Elvis. Gone are the calm fans that simply

want an autograph. Th_ey’ve been
replaced by a faceless, mob—like mass of

extended arms desperately reaching out

to touch their rock deity.

While “Where
is Elvis?” chronicles
this meteoric rise in
Elvis’ celebrity graph-
ically, it also captures
the darker moments of
his early career.

of this comes from a
photo taken in 1956
by Wertheimer, titled
,“10' cents a print,
Colonel Tom Parker,
Elvis Presley’s man-
ager, hawks 8x10

Memphis.” Elvis is nowhere to be found
in this image, other than in the numerous
headshots that Col. Parkeris passing out
to a horde of girls. Elvis’ absence from
this image is startling in light of the way
his manager has commodiﬁed him, even
at this early stage in his career. It’s a
striking image made all the more nefari-
ous by Wertheimer’s capturing of Col.
Parker in shadow.

One example-

glossies of his’, star at
Russwood Stadium, .'

tograph, taken in 1958 by
Norman Bergsma, shows Elvis and his
parents in a seemingly constructed pose,
devoid of any kind of spontaneity like
that in Wertheimer’s image. And unlike
in the previous photo of Elvis kissing his
mother, Gladys Presley’s face is tired
and sunken. She isn’t basking in the kiss
of her son. Rather, she appears bored by
it, as if this scene has been done so many
times for so many photographers that
this relationship has become a chore.
When the two images are considered
together as showing the destruction of a
familial relationship so close to Elvis,
the group of photographs takes on a dif-
ferent tone. We’re no longer looking at
the mere documenting of a rock legend
— we’re looking at the destruction of his

personal life ‘from the earliest moments

of his storied career.

“Where is Elvis?” is more than the
title of the exhibition; it’s a question
viewers must consider when looking at
these photographs. We’re used to seeing
Elvis the performer and the star — the
Elvis that America consumes through
movies and records. But that Elvis isn’t
in this exhibition.

The Elvis here is a person who per-
formed, certainly, but did so at a very
human cost ——straining himself and his
relationships with those closest to him as
he was becoming “The King,” a god of
rock and roll.

The Golden Age of Grotesque
Marilyn Manson
Nothing/lnterscope Records
skim/2

In the May 15, 2003 issue of Rolling
Stone, Marilyn Manson wrote a column
titled “The Dead Rock Star” in which he
reflected on rock stars becoming immortal
by dying in their prime, a la Jim Morrison
and Kurt Cobain. After the Columbine
High School shootings on April 20, 1999,
it seemed as if Manson and his music were
only going to be immortalized by infamy.
Record sales were down and death threats
were up as blame for the shootings was
pointed toward the shock rockers. VV1th
the release of the band’s latest album, The
Golden Age of Grotesque, don’t look for
Marilyn Manson to burn out or fade away
anytime soon.

As introduced in the second track,
“This is the New S—,” Manson indeed
gives us a taste of what’s to come on the
album. The album’s tone is less dark than
previous releases, but profanity, vulgarity
and growled lyrics still ensue, with an
abundant amount of sexual references
throughout the album.

Probably the most blasphemous track
on the album is “Para nior,” where girls
list reasons for screwing Manson. In “Slut
Garden,” Manson sings about a church, a
steeple and a lewd act making everyone

The coming of the golden age

“God’s people.” It doesn’t take a listen to
the song to ﬁgure out what exactly that act
1S.

On “mOBSCENE,” the ﬁrst single to
be released off the album, the old tradi-
tional cheer “Be Aggressive” is revamped
by Manson’s cheer squad to say, “Be
obscene, be be obscene.” It’s extremely
catchy. Who ever thought Marilyn
Manson would produce catchy music?

This is the ﬁrst Marilyn Manson
album to be recorded without bassist
Twiggy Ramirez, who was fired by
Manson because of his lack of devotion to

the band. I-Iis replacement, Tim Skold, the —

former bassist for KMFDM, produced the
album. »

Before Manson made it as a musician,
he was a writer who enjoyed a brief stint
as a music journalist. His penchant for
writing stuck with him, ashe brilliantly
penned all of the songs on The Golden
Age of Grotesque. I

The music is inﬂuenced by a plethora
of 19th and 20'thcentury movements such
as surrealismhanddandyism. The illegal-
in-America liquor absinthe also played a
key role in the outcome of the album.

But wherever Manson sought his inﬂu-
ences, the ﬁnal product is soaked with
rnind—titi1lating tunes that are merely a
preview of what’s to come in terms of
Manson’s ever-evolving musical style.

Go Big Records

Have you listened to the radio lately? Have
you noticed how all the bands sound exactly alike?
Have you noticed how sometimes things get so bad
that you confuse bands for one another? Shortie
may very well be part of a commission designed to
proliferate this similarity. With their debut LP,
Worthless Smiles, Shortie proves they were proba-
bly kings of the karaoke clubs, singing everybody
else’s songs and sounding just like them.

A quick glance at Worthless Smiles’ cover art
immediately hints at the band’s lack of originality.
The Talking Heads/Green Day—style censored
faces have been done a million times. When you
_ L M V _ put the CD into your player, the trend“ continues.
I ' ’ "’ 1', ' I 4 5"” Huge, distorted few-chord guitar riffs greet you

“we must scream our lyrics because we’re an angry
rock ban ” parts come in. That practice works if

Worthless Smiles

you’re Systemof a Down. It works if you’re Fear
Factory. Shortie isneither. V.

If it weren’t for the brief pauses between the
tracks on Won‘hlesstSmilés§ you might not be able
to tell when one track ends and the next begins.
Half of the songs begin with similar-sounding,
drawn-out, single chords. The same guitar rilf
seems to run through the entire album, varying by
a few strings here and there. The vocals are horri-
bly hook- or harmony-free, and the lyrics are notl1—
ing special. Basically, you get an album with 10 dif-
ferent takes on the same song, which wasn’t good
to begin with._

For more proof of carbon—copied mediocrity,
let’s examine the song titles. We have “The One,”
“Getting Over You,” “Waiting” and “Kill The
World,” among some of the gems. The biggest
travesty comes in the form of “David Bowie,” a
song that bears no similarity to the rock legend,
except for having the phrase “you’re changing on
me” repeated throughout And, just for fun, it still
sounds exactly like the other nine tracks.

In a world of copycats, Shortie is that really
faded picture that comes after you make a copy of
a copy of a copy. All this band needs is a new name.
Staind Bizkit would do just ﬁne.

Directed by Troy Miller

When the movie ended, four teenage girls sit-
ting behind me said, in unison, “That movie was
cute.” ' '

Cute? A cute movie is something like “Finding
Nemo” or “Rugrats Go Wild,” not, “Dumb and
Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.”

No, this movie was not cute at all. And it was-
n’t funny either. Mind you, I overheard these same
girls, who thought this movie was good and cute,
using the _word “like” a billion times in a five-
minute conversation.

The premise of “Dumb and Dumberer” is that
before Harry Dunne and Lloyd Christmas went

- through their dumbrhijinx in the original movie,

starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, there was
high school, where Harry and Lloyd met.
In this prequel, Harry (Derek Richardson) and

Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen) meet on their way to

.g- ,1.

monotony of the confined setting is

the first day of class. Harry has been home-

schooled all his life (he is supposed to_ibe;1i8).»a‘nd _,
has no friends, with the exception of  ifmag.inary' 

pirate that he calls Captain Rob. ,. _ 
Lloyd, on the other hand, lives in the-basement
of the school with his father, Ray (Luis Guzman)

the high school janitor. Even though Lloyd livesin»

the school, we see him leaving the schoolutogo

catch a bus to come to the school —— I hopeeI' did-‘_

n’t lose you there, it’s dumb I know. , .
On his way to catch the bus, Lloyd ypliterally
runs into Harry, chipping his tooth and putting a
knot in'Harry’s forehead. The two become} instant
friends. i ‘

Principal Collins (Eugene Levy)_5 and 

Heller, the cafeteria lady, played by Cheri"Oteri,
plan to steal money from the school by forming a
Special Needs Class, then move to Hawaii togeth-
er. All they need is to find some special needs stu-
dents. Who better than our two moronic protago-
nists?

The script for this movie was terrible. Simple .

sight gags were used to try to get laughs and, basi-

cally, this was a movie that shouldn’t have been

made. Olsen and Richardson had the look of the
characters, but there is no way anyone can dupli-
cate what Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels did in the
original. This is clear when Harry and Lloyd are
eating dinner at Harry’s house and Lloyd says the
classic line, “I like it a lot.” Olsen tried his best,
but “You can’t triple stamp a double stamp.”

nicely broken up by cuts to the
novel’s developing storyline.
Wilson keeps the comedy particu-
larly fresh by narrating over the
scenes from the novel, and Hudson,
through quips and comments,
clearly demonstrates the humor
inherent in reality as well as in
romance. Constantly playing off
one another, these two characters
demonstrate how love requires a
balance of practicality and
romance.

Witty and romantic, “Alex and
Emma” will appeal to a variety of
audiences on a number of different
levels.

avers‘: ’

According to the “Dirty Blonde” script, “A
tough girl doesn’t care if you think she’s a nice
girl. A tough girl walks with her whole body and
says it like it is. When presented with two evils, a

tough girl will pick the one she hasn’t tried

before.”

Mae West was the ultimate tough girl of classic
Hollywood. Her raunchy, bold and often hilarious
tough-girl attitude is brought to life in “Dirty
Blonde,” Pittsburgh Public Theater’s production
that follows the lives of two West fans.

The show opens in the present day, where we
meet Jo,— an aspiring actress, and Charlie, a film
librarian. As their individual stories and obsessions
with West develop, they venture to their idol’s
grave on the anniversary of her de_ath. Their mutu-

al love of the blonde bombshell brings them
together and the two begin to find themselves, as
well as each other. .

The show moves in and out of the experiences,
past and present, of both Jo and Charlie, while
weaving in the story of West’s provocative acting

A career. West,‘ who began performing at age 5,

became known for her buxom curves and sexy
comedy, and experienced hard—earned success on
both stage and screen. Sprinkled with upbeat musi-
cal numbers, “Dirty Blonde” humorously explores
the ideas of friendship, love, obsession and what it
means to be a tough girl. , '

Ryan Dunn tackles the roles of. both.Jo and
Mac, successfully creating separate personas for
each character. Dunn seamlessly moves from one
character to the other in mere seconds, as the show
switches from present to past and back again.
Combining West’s classic, seductive sashay with
her husky Brooklyn accent, ‘Dunn brings to life

West’s inherent sexuality, playing the role to per-

fection. —
Lucas Caleb Rooney takes on the role of
Charlie, as well as other ‘small, male roles.

Rooney’s comedic timing is excellent, as when we ~

see Charlie ﬂounder as an awkward teenager and
mature into an awkward adult. He brings a vulner-
ability and uptight insecurity to Charlie that stems
from a removal from the world around him.

Acting as musical director and playing numer- ’

for. While Jo and Charlie grapple with an uncon- ;

West is much more than just a “Dirty Blonde.”

Pitt and West Virginia line up for a play during last year’s Backyard Brawl. As members of the Big East, the two teams
face each other annually on the football ﬁeld. -

Blumenthal set for discovery

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

The attempt to prohibit the Atlantic
Coast Conference from expanding took
another twist last Thursday, thanks to
Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal.

On June 12, Blumenthal filed a
motion in Hartford Superior Court to
expedite discovery in the lawsuit
against Miami, Boston College and the
ACC, which was ﬁled on June 6 by Pitt,
Rutgers, Virginia Tech, West Virginia
and Connecticut. The motion, if grant-

ed, would force the three defendants to _'

produce documents and give deposi-
tions much sooner than would normally
occur. I

The motion seeks a variety of doc-
uments, dating back to Jan. 1, 1997,
from the three defendants, as well as
Syracuse and the 3ACC’s member
schools. Despite also considering leav-
ing the Big East for the ACC, Syracuse
was not listed as one of the defendants
in the lawsuit. B

“Our legal cause remains clearly
urgent and immediate,” Blumenthal
told ESPN .com. “In two separate let-
ters, we gave the defendants a chance to
voluntarily cooperate with our discov-
ery request. They have provided no
acceptable response.”

scan:

Among the requested documents
are:

- The ACC’s plans to expand its
conference membership to other
schools.

0 Plans by the defecting schools to
leave the Big East.

-Any Big East member’s intentions
to remain, or not remain, in the confer-
ence. .

- Efforts by any of the defecting
schools, the ACC or any current ACC
member to persuade any other Big East
schools to depart from the Big East.

0 The future composition of the
Bowl Championship Series or the
potential impact of any conference
realignment on the BCS, including any
potential impact on television contracts
or rights. ’

0 Any studies of the impact, ﬁnan-
cial or otherwise, on the ACC, Big East,
or any member school of either confer-
ence or any Big East schools joiningthe
ACC. ’ _ .

0 Any direct or indirect communica-
tions between or among the ACC, any
of its member schools, the defecting
schools or any television or broadcast
network regarding any potential impact
of any conference realignment on the
ACC or Big East.

‘ “We say, in our lawsuit, that these
defendants deliberately schemed to

 

destroy the Big East and take for them-
selves the value of what has been creat-
ed if the Big East loses its stature in the
BCS or disbands,” Blumenthal said.
“We want these schools and the ACC to

pay for false statements that they know-

ingly made that we would rely on.”
Blumenthal was not the only one
adding his name to the lawsuit on
Thursday, as Virginia Attorney General
Jerry Kilgore joined in the lawsuit, sid-
ing himself with Virginia Tech rather

-than_ACC member Virginia.

Kilgore’s decision could become
even more important because Virginia
president, John T. Casteen III, is
believed to still be unsure about the
conference’s plans for expansion. The
ACC needs seven of its nine schools to
vote for expansion; Duke and North
Carolina are reportedly against it.

While the ACC members will vote
on adding all three Big East teams
before the end of the month, it is likely
that the conference will settle for
expanding by adding only  By
doing that, the ACC would add to its
football prestige by having two nation-
al powers, with Florida State being the
other.

The Big East would probably
accept losing one school because it is

Will this be the year that Miami
footbal1’s reign over the Big East
comes to an end?

It could be for one obvious rea-
son — Miami wants to jump ship
and run over to the Atlantic Coast
Conference. This is a move I am not
in favor of, but I am not going to
rant and rave about it.

~Miami’s dominance may come
to an end because Pitt may have the
team to beat them for the first time
since 1997.
Pitt lost a heartbreaker to Miami
last season, after quarterback Rod
Rutherford overthrew 5-foot-l0-
inch wide receiver Yogi Roth in the
end zone.

This season, Miami returns to
our house. Pitt is a year older, a
year wiser and has already received
several accolades during the off-
season. Most notably, The Sporting
News ranked Pitt’s coaching staff
No. 3 nationally. This ranking is
ahead of Miami, whose coaching
staff is ranked No. 6.

The Panthers finished 9-4 last
season, won the Insight Bowl and
have been ranked as high as No. 8
nationally in CBS Sportsline’s pre-
season poll.

The Sporting News ranks their
special teams N o. 2. Also ranked by
the magazine are Pitt’s backfield
and wide receivers at No. 9 and 10,

respectively.

Miami lost more key players to
the draft and graduation: quarter-
back Ken Dorsey, running back
Willis McGahee and wide receiver

Get naked and run around

Mark Sunday’s date down in
your book of history. On June 15,
2003, men and women reached
another level of equality,‘and it took
place at golf’s'U.S. Open.

No, Annika Sorenstam didn’t
compete in another PGA event. _

As eventual champion Jim Furyk

prepared for a putt


on the 11th hole, a

woman left the
stands ’ and
approached the
golfer with two

roses. That’s nice,
you might say, but
what A does that ’ g 
have to do with " 
equality? That’s

just like thosewomen who run onto
baseball fields to give players a
smooch on the check.

Except there was something
noticeably different about this
woman, especially to the male popu-
lation in attendance. With that said,
we’ve narrowed it down to knowing:
She didn’t have a new pair of shoes
and she didn’t just get her hair done.

"It. wasn’t so much what was dif-
ferent about her; it was more like
what was missing. A I

Yes, sports fans, it was a female

streaker. -

Forthe first time in recent mem-

cry, a woman bared all —-— well, actu-
ally just her breasts — and interrupt-
ed a professional sporting event.

To that, I have only two things to
say: I can’t believe I just used the
word “breasts” in a sports column,
and it’s about freaking time.

For years, we’ve had to deal with
middle-aged men, parading around
in nothing but their shoes while you-
know—what ﬂops around the field.
Finally, we get to see some —-— wait.

I mean, urn, shame on "her.
Running,around without a top. I hope
the police at the U.S. Open arrested
her on the spot and took her to jail.
Hmm —— that means they would have

had to use handcuffs.

Anyway, while some will say
what the woman did was wrong, I
think the greater issue is the way
Furyk responded.

"I was definitely caught off
guard,” he said afterward. “I just
wanted‘ to back off from the situation
and get back‘ to
playing golf.”

Are you kid-
ding me? Get back
to playing golf?

If a topless
woman comes out
of nowhere and
runs toward me,
the last thing on
- my mind is
whether or not I’m going to make the
putt. In fact, I probably wouldn’t be
thinking about much of anything at
that’ point. p

All right, so his wife was watch-
ing from the stands, but he could
have at least accepted the roses from
his fan. Instead, she probably had to
give them to some grubby police
officer who kept her from putting her
top back on so he could stare at her
goods while drooling all over him-
self.

But back to the issue at hand —
we need more female streakers.

Title IX brought a new, albeit not
nearly perfect, form of equality to
sports."-There are now professional
women’s sports leagues in basket-
ball, soccer and football. ’Women
have also participated with men in
minor league hockey and baseball,
along with professional golf.

It is now time to bring streaking
to the same level. Men and women
could even pair up for some synchro-
nized’ streaking, and judges could
award points, or bail bonds, for style.

Just don’t ask me to be the first
one to do it. A

THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, June 18, 2003

Offensive linemen Matt Morgan’ and Bryan Anderson show unity in the huddle,
which is something that could be lacking in the Big East. '

Virginia attorney general gets
involved in Big East lawsuit.

Big East, page 15

likely that Louisville would replace
Miami. This way, the conference would
be able to keep its BCS bid and would
improveits standing inibasketball. It is
also possible that the Big East would
try to expand to 16 teams for basketball
by adding Marquette and Xavier, as
well. . '

If Syracuse and Boston College do
join Miami in the ACC, it is likely that
the Big East would try to replace them
with Louisville and two of the follow-
ing four schools: East Carolina,
Cincinnati, South Florida or Central
Florida.

If the ACC votes against expansion
— or if the Big East is able to find
replacements for Miami, Boston
College and Syracuse _— the lawsuit

JOE MARCHILENA/SPORTS EDITOR

would stand, according to Blumenthal.

“We would still hold accountable
Boston College and Miami and the
ACC for the costs [of _rebuilding the
conference],” he said. “There is no
assurance as to what’ they will do at this
point.”

The lawsuit claims that both Miami
and Boston College made promises to
remain in the Big East, prompting other
members to spend “hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars” on new or expanded
facilities. UConn spent $90 million on
its new football stadium, while Pitt
spent $100 million on the Petersen
Events Center. '

“The cost of the stadium and the
upgrading of the [UConn] football team
was done on false promises,”
Blumenthal added. “The other schools
have similar damages and each upgrad-
ed their facilities.”

Miami weakened by draft, graduation

Nash, page 15

Andre Johnson on offense. Vince

Norfolk is the only starter from last
season’s defensive line.
Pitt is returning most of its

starters on both sides of the ball.

And even though some key players
were lost, the Panthers have capable
players to fill those Voids.

‘ The offensive line is an area of
concern, but Rutherford has
emerged as a potent quarterback and
running back Brandon Miree proved
that he could take over games.

Also, look for wide receiver
LarrytFitzgerald to be even more
explosive as a sophomore. .

Replacing Gerald Hayes in the
middle of the defense will be a
tough task, but Lewis Moore seems
capable of being the leader this
year. i A

The linebacking corps will be

inexperienced,» since Moore will be

the only returning starter. Moore
will have to emerge as the leader of
what appears to be a young group of
linebackers, and the secondary
should be dominant as it returns
Shawntae Spencer, Tez Morris,
Tyrone Gilliard, William Ferguson
and Corey Humphries. A

Claude Harriott, ranked as the
nation’s third—best defensive end by
The Sporting News, will lead the
charge on the defensive line and,

hopefully, will be ready to return to .

form by Sept. 6.

Several other Panthers are
ranked in the top 10 at their posi-
tions. This list includes wide receiv-

er Fitzgerald, ranked No. 5; offen-

sive tackle Rob Petitti, ranked No.
6; tight end Kris Wilson, ranked No.
9; fullback Lousaka Polite, ranked
No. 5;" punter Andy Lee, ranked No.
6; and strong safety Gilliard, ranked

'No.l0.

Well, Walt Harris, let’s not
make liars out of The Sporting
News and other publications that
think highly of the Panthers. They

have predicted that Pitt has some of
the nation’s best players and coach-
ing staff.

Miami is limping into this sea-
son after losing the national cham-
pionship and valuable players. Pitt
has the advantage because it has
grown together as a unit over the
last couple of years.

The Panthers have all the tools
to beat Miami this season and make
a serious run at a Bowl
Championship Series bid. It is time

for the Panthers to return to an era

of excellence on the football field.
