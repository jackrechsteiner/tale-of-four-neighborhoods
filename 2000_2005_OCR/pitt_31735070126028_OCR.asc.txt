Drue Heinz Prize
Winners read
from short stories

reading in the Masonic Temple last night celebrating the
award’s 20th anniversary. . ’

“All the writers here, I’m told, have something to do with

Pittsburgh,” said George Plimpton, editor of The Paris
« Review, while introducing the ﬁve writers.

Brett Ellen Block, this year’s winner, read first from her
collection of short stories.

Brushing her long, brown hair from her face, she told the
story of a woman dealing-0 with a burglary and unfaithful
boyfriend by confronting a hit-and-run driver. /

“I’m just driving, I don’t know where,”_ Block read soft-
ly into the microphone. “I straightened her out — she knows
where she’s going now.”

Past winners Stewart O’Nan and Jane McCafferty also
read from their current works. ,

O’Nan told a story about a teen-ager’s reaction to death,
and McCafferty read about a preteen dealing with her alco-
holic veteran father.

The Drue Heinz Literature Prize, which is open to anyone
not afﬁliated with the University, has a list of famous judges
that select the winners. The list of judges includes Raymond
Carver, Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff and
John Edgar Wideman. Wolff and Wideman both read last
night. ~ ’

y  w“This is a remarkable list of judges,” Plimpton said as

 ..W,o.lff-took the podium. . A
* f ‘ Swaying back and forth, Wolff got into character as he

toldthe story about dying thoughts of a literary-critic. -"

0 ‘ “You like me, brightboy? Youwarma suck my dick?eYou i

think you can f—-- with me?” Wolff read, eliciting laughter and
bouts of spontaneous applause from the audience.
.- Pittsburgh native Wideman, who recently edited “20: The

.. » best of the Drue Heinz Literature Prize,” read last.
_ _ _ -“This is not about getting the prize, it’s the fact we par- '
' ticipate in this activity that keeps the language“ alive,”

Wideman said. “We touch it, feel it, dance to it. If we do it
right the language thrives. If the language falters, then we
fail.” * ‘

' Unfolding a yellow-lined sheet of paper, he read a short
story about two enemies embracing, grasping hands and leap-

‘ _. ingto their deaths off a World Trade Center tower on Sept. 11.
V  y 2 The audience was silent when he ﬁnished, then‘ broke into _
‘ louthd.-applause.

I ' Plimpton ended the reading by thanking local, philan-
. thropist Drue Heinz and invited the audience to the book sign-

. ing“ that followed. '

The winner of the 2002 Drue Heinz Literature Prize will
be announced in February. The prize carries a cash award of

L $10,000 and publication by the University of Pittsburgh Press.

Electronic beat, all-night

parties beckon ravers

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer

, What hits ﬁrst is the beat.

_ Beyond the green light-stick streaks and orange
glow of cigarettes cutting through the darkness, beyond
the baggy pants pooling at the ankles of both sexes,
beyond the squeak of athletic shoes on concrete ﬂoors
and thick smell of sweatﬁslick bodies, it’s this beat that
draws the crowd together, makes them bob their heads

, and tick their hips like human metronomes.

DNA, an electronic music/record release party,
held on Oct. 20 at Club Liqueﬁed Downtown, is just
one example of the local electronic music scene.’ This
movement encompasses paitiesstaged in nightclubs,
DJ battles and raves —— all night parties staged in ware-
houses, ﬁelds, and other often illegally occupied
venues.

Still, the term “raves” is often applied to the former
two. Aside from diﬁerences in location, parties, raves

. and battles often share much in common: electronical-
ly producedmusic, young people dancing for hours

and a barrage of lights, colors and sounds merging into
sensory feast. . v .

One thing is for sure: This ain’t your daddy’s sock
hop. .
For one thing, this party features 11-year-old DJ
Bass Invader. Ron Czamecki -— Bass Invader’s father
and co—owner of NRG Productions along with his wife,

_ ., Velvet— organized DNA and had his son spin there.

And though Czamecki is quick to clarify that his
party is “not a rave, it’s a full-blown production,” the
lines between party and rave blur. .

The National Drug Intelligence Center, in its
Pennsylvania Drug Threat Assessment, deﬁnes raves
as “all-night dance parties [that] feature. . .techno-music
[held] in established facilities such as dance clubs or i
 . .warehouses or ﬁelds.”

DanceSafe, an organization that promotes drug
education and awareness, distinguishes between raves
and nightclub-based parties, noting that the ﬁrst are
held in warehouses and ﬁelds and the second in more
legitimate venues.

The drug culture often associated with electronic
music further complicates matters. Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette colunmist Brian O’Neil1, in a Jan. 28, 2001,
column, said, “with the unening wisdom. . .of a mid-
dle-aged man who has never seen a rave up close,” that
a rave is an “all-night party that attracts young people
who like to dance and do drugs.” ’ ' '

V Drugs like MDMA, GHB, ketamine and LSD —
better known as Ecstasy, Liquid X, Special K and acid,
respectively —— are an intrinsic part of the electronic

‘ music and dance culture.

Because‘ organizations like DanceSafe work with
people who attend raves, their work binds the issues

Debating Union debates causes of terrorism

MELANIE DONAHOO
Staff Writer

What caused the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11?
How can further attacks be prevented, and should
Americans get back to “business as usual?”

These were the topics of debate Monday night
during a forum on terrorism hosted by the William
Pitt Debating Union.

Held in the Kurtzman Room of the William
Pitt Union, students participating in the event pre-
sented three-minute speeches about terrorism and
its causes. Gordon Mitchell, director of the debat-
ing union, said that public discussion is invaluable
during times of war.

“There’s a lack of quality public discussion on
this, that’s why we convened tonight,” Mitchell
said. O

Peter Klein, a member of the debating union,
suggested that by trying to understand the terror-
ists and the motivation behind the attacks, the
public could put together a more effective
response.

Other students cited religious beliefs and
Osama bin Laden’s manipulation of those beliefs
as the reason for the attacks.

“Osama bin Laden has hijacked Islam, just
like the terrorists who hijacked the planes they
slammed into the World Trade Center,” Klein said.

Rachel Brinson, another member of the debat-
ing union, said, “Bin Laden has used religionas a
vehicle to gain support in his quest to remove U.S.
involvement with the Saudi Arabian government.”

To prevent further terrorist attacks, Jason

Lawrence suggested tightening airport security
through the implementation of face recognition
technology. Denise Olczak, another debating
union member, said we first need to understand
our enemy before we can formulate a response.

' “We must remain fully aware that violence
breeds “violence,” Olczak said. “We’re not going
to prevent further attacks with military action
unless we understand the current grievances
against us.”

But in the meantime, should the United States
go back to business as usual?

Andy Stephany and Kevin Ayotte think so.

“We cannot give in to the fear terrorism is
meant to inspire,” Ayotte said. “Paranoia, in this
case, accomplishes nothing.”

Stephany said he believes that before we can
go back to business as usual, we must first deter-
mine whether that business was right to begin
with.

“We cannot assume that the U.S. can impose
its values on the world,’’ Stephany said. ,

Ayotte agreed. “One thing that disturbs me is

, the absence of reﬂection of our own government

on foreign policy,” he said. “We cannot start this
discussion about how to respond before assuming
our current policy is correct.”

Ken Boas, a representative of the Thomas
Merton Center for Peace and Social Justice,
agreed with Mitchell that more open discussion
forums are needed.

“George W. Bush should listen to us,” Boas
said. “We put him in office and we can take him
out of office.”

Union graveyard marks
death of affirmative action

ERIN BRACHLOW
Staff Writer

Students wandered around a somber
graveyard on the William Pitt Union
lawn as they mourned the death of an
important icon of higher education.‘ .

That icon, now gone according to
some students there, was educational
access.

The Union lawn was the site of

_ more than 20 gravestones that marked

the wrongful death of equal educational
access for minority students at Pitt and
other universities across the country.
Some of those tombstones dis-
played statistics about racial disparities
in Pitt’s student body, including the 1
percent decrease in black professional
students from 1996 to 2000, while oth-
ers described how 89 percent of engi-
neering master’s degrees went to male
students in 1998. The remaining plots

marked ‘ the “death” of fundamental’

principles like the right to an education.

Student Government Board, the
academic affairs committee and the U.S.
Student Association in Washington,
D.C., coordinated the event to endorse
National Take Affirmative Action Day
yesterday. USSA, an organization that
works with the student governments and

«groups of colleges‘ and universities-

nationwide, is starting the Student of
Color Campus Diversity . Project, a

national campaign to push schools to

increase affirmative action efforts.
“Diversity is important for enrich-
ing a campus,” USSA President Julia
Beatty» said, “and educational access
dies when we do not support affirmative
action.”. ’

USSA also encourages the support ,

of recruitment and retention programs
for underrepresented students and has

. pushed for funding and legislation for

various universities based on each stu-
dent body. , . ‘
“We interpret [our job] very broad-
ly,” Beatty said. “We realize students
come in all shapes and sizes.”
Continuing Pitt’s 10-year involve-
ment with USSA, SGB planned
Tuesday’s Halloween Fest. '
“We wanted to increase awareness

_ about affirmative action and recruitment

and retention programs,” said SGB
member Kerianne Ludwig, who also
serves on USSA’s board. “We wantvto
look at the problems with the‘ current
system.” A

Ludwig said she wants the campus
to challenge states whose legislation is

questioning what she called a necessity.

for affirmative action.
“Our response is race should be a

‘ factor because racism is a factor,” she

said. .

, In addition to disseminating infor-
mation, SGB and USSA focused the
event of Halloween. in order to incorpo-
rate “the death of education,” according
to Beatty. Students could bob for apples,
bite edoughnuts hanging from a string
and eat plenty of candy and cookies.

The event also occurred after SGB
passed a new resolution to create a
recruitment/retention task force. Passed
Monday, the resolution, introduced by
Ludwig and fellow" board member

AMichelle‘ Agostini, lists the obstacles

affirmative action has faced recently,
along with a plan to implement new
standards at Pitt.’

“[The task force] will make sure we
realize the impact institutionalized

racism has on students,” Agostini said. 

The task force will investigate Pitt’s
current recruitment and retention pro-
grams and report any suggestions for
improvement to Chancellor Mark j
Nordenberg, the Board of Trustees and
the public. J" I

Although this is a step in 'SGB’s
ongoing racial proﬁling "agenda started '
last semester, Beatty emphasized that

affirmative action is not an issue solely

basedhon race. V ,
“Affirmative. action has benefited

women the most — of all colors,” she 0

said. “The cause has a lot of voices 
it’s an issue of education.” "

In light of recent national events,‘
Beatty said she thinks affirmative action
awareness is even more important at ”
Pitt, where she said some students have
fallenvictim to racial proﬁling.

“We need to have a.campus climate ~ .

that’s welcoming to all students,”> she

said. “We need to focus on underrepre-up ' 

sented students and we need to help.” "

Sorority sells candy to raise
breast cancer awareness

REBECCA HUDOCK
Staff Writer

Some people work hard on
Halloween by going door—to-door to
collect candy. V

The smart or lazy people can just
go to William Pitt Union and buy a
boo bag from Alpha Kappa Alpha.

But Alpha Kappa Alpha, the
nation’s oldest black sorority, isn’t just
selling the candy—filled bags to make
students’ Halloweens sweeter, they’re
raising money and awareness for
breast cancer.

The sale, which began on Monday,
will continue today on the ground
ﬂoor of the Union. .

In addition to the bags, on sale for
$1.50, information on screening and
self-checking for lumps is available at
the table.

“Breast cancer affects everyone.
Even men need to be informed so they
can tell their girlfriends and mothers,”
said Monica Lamar, Alpha Kappa

Alpha’s graduate adviser. .

On the first day of the sale, the 70
‘bags the sisters prepared sold out.

“We made 32- more bags that night
and then 55 more while we sat at the
table yesterday,” said Alpha Kappa
Alpha president Angela Elam. “We
sold them as we made them.”

The sorority will donate all the
money made from the three—day sale
to the Susan G. Komen Foundation,
the organization that hosts

. Pittsburgh’s annual. Great ‘Race, an

event in which Alpha Kappa Alpha
sisters participate. -

In addition to their work for breast
cancer awareness, the sisters hold an
average of two service events a month.

“We have targets that we try to
focus on, like health, arts, economics
and the black family,” Elam said.

In the coming months Alpha
Kappa Alpha will participatein a coat
and clothing drive and blood pressure
screening and will hand out informa-
tion promoting diabetes awareness.

concerning drugs to these events. Such
drugs, termed “club drugs,” though used in
a wider arena, have recently attracted the
attention, of police and government ofﬁ—
cials.

As a result, both DNA and Cloudbreak
Production’s Record Breakin’, a DJ spin-
off held at the Shadow Lounge on Oct. 6,
stationed security at their entrances, frisk-

' ing the Ecko— and Adidas-bedecked atten-
,, dees.

Looking into pockets, feeling under
hoodies and even removing hats to run their
hands through spiked, beaded and dread-
locked hair, they conﬁscated drugs and
related paraphernalia. Guards also milled
around inside, keeping an eye on the crowd.

But the guards did not take bottled
water or sports drinks that the National
Drug Intelligence Center listed as indirectly
promoting drug use.

The National Drug Intelligence Center
maintains that because such drinks manage
dehydration and hypertherrnia that come
from dancing for hours in closed condi-
tions, partiers are more likely to take drugs
when they are available. -

DanceSafe reports that more than 100
of the Ecstasy-related deaths_in past years

can be attributed to heat stroke, rather than ‘

overdoses of the drug itselﬂ
But even after the thorough pat—downs
at DNA, a young man sporting sideburns

Security watches parties closely

and a blue T—shi1t asked DNA partygoers if

they wanted to roll, which means to take‘

Ecstasy. Still, few at the event bore the
olive—sized pupils or chattering teeth symp-
tomatic of Ecstasy use.

The lack of what are idiomatically
known as e—tards indicates the trend in the
greater Pittsburgh area. Czamecki said he’s
noticed that there has been a decline in
MDMA and ketarnine use in recent
months. ,

Two factors conuibute to this: city
crackdowns on raves, and divisions in the
scene itself. As O’Neill reported, last
January city officials shut down the Neville
Ice Arena, saying that the arena, which had
staged raves and other parties, had violated
its lease.

Splits exist within the scene based on
the type of music, which can be broken into
categories such as trance, drum and bass,
jungle, breaks, house, two—step and so forth
according to the speed measured in beats
per minute. A

Greater divides also permeate the cul-
ture, such as age differences, especially
between older more established DJs and
their younger listeners. As a local spinner

DJ Hooker, 23, said, “I don’t want to see A

some 14-year-old f———ed up, can’t walk,
taken out by paramedics.”

, Even so, many in the scene bring the
focus back to the music. DJ Kingpin
emphasizes that he spins “for the love of the
music.”

Tricks and treats
Oct. 31 a perfect day for revelrjy

Boo!

Did we scare you? OK, maybe not.
But today is the day to be scared.

It’s Halloween. And although we’re
not little children anymore, Halloween still
provides ample opportunities for fright-
making and frolicking.

Many students may have the urge to‘

go to one of the nearby neighborhoods and
trick or treat. But we’re in college, and
being that we’re supposedly mature, this
newspaper has a better idea: reverse trick
or treating.

Reverse trick or treating?’That’s right
— rather than going around a neighborhood

and asking people to give you candy, you -

should go around, say, your residence hall
ﬂoor and give other people candy. Not
only is this a great way to meet your neigh-
bors, it will also make you instantly popu-
lar. .

Also, take this opportunity to spread a
little Halloween goodwill. Reverse trick or
treat the people in your life who you appre-
ciate but rarely thank, like the woman who
swipes your card at Eddie’s or the boy who
sits next to you in astronomy class and
keeps you from falling asleep.

, Since the unveiling of the panther out-
side William Pitt Union, students have
occasionally decorated it for football
games. Halloween is another great time to

give it a costume. You could dress the pan-
ther in the normal garb of this holiday, such
as a witch, ghost or Catholic schoolgirl.

But our suggestion for a costume for
the panther is Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg. While we’re not sure of the
logistics of such an undertaking, it can be
done, perhaps with a dapper suit and plas-
tered smile.

Dress yourself up in the wildest cos-
tume you can irriagine. Short of ideas? In
the spirit of Pitt pride, try dressing as
prominent ﬁgures from the University.

An obvious choice would be the pan-
ther — just beware of people protesting
how much you spent on the costume.

. Or dress as your favorite Pitt athlete.
Or your favorite Oakland beggar. You
could dress as a Pitt police officer. Or as
your favorite nationality room. You could
even be your favorite homecoming candi-
date. I

But our N o. 1 recommendation — dis-
guise yourself as The Pitt News, i.e. dress
only in The Pitt News. It can be done —
trust us. But please, use more than one
newspapen ' . --

A final warning — beware of the
ghosts of Oakland past, especially when
walking past the former locations of places
such as C.J. Bamey’s, Music X and the
Beehive. They could be haunted.

A tribute to a devoted mother

It’s about six in the evening and- I’m
in the intensive care unit of Riddle

Memorial Hospital standing next to my -

sister, my father and my granthnother.
My mother is lying before us in a clut-
tered hospital bed, and there is no sound
but that of the respirator, hissing and
clicking, pumping 70 percent oxygen
into her bloodstream every few seconds.

Tomorrow, the doctors will increase
it to a hundred. ,

Reality hasnot yet settled in. I think

ble, but victims of serious head trauma, I '

learned, can still function in a bemused

state of mind, acting as if nothing at all i_

has occurred.‘

The commotion awakened my father
and, seeing her in this state, he dialed
911. The paramedics rushed her to the
hospital.‘ _ .

Iarrived a few hours later on an
emergency ﬂight from Pittsburgh. My
mother was kept alive on the respirator
for two days and, trust me, you will

’this is a joke. I think she .

will rise up at any minute,
wrench that ghastly tube
from her mouth, and we’ll
laugh at what a great joke it
really was. Something

were meant to be.

my parents and I were sip-

My sister and father, as usual, went

‘to bed the night they" returned to

Philadelphia well before my mother did.

She’d always had a penchant for work-:

ing late into the night.

The doctors at Riddle Memorial
speculated that somewhere around 2 or 3
a.m., my mother suffered a very sudden
brain aneurysm. She fell to the ﬂoor,
severely fracturing her skull. Somehow,
she managed in this condition. to crawl
back into bed.

devastating. The source, the very nucleus

within my mother’s heart.

True confessions of an admitted Halloween addict

I’m not talking about the 13—year—olds solidified my opinion of

Halloween based on All Hallow’s Eve,
which served as a prelude to Day of
the Dead and is still sacred in some
places. That Halloween is filled with
myth and mysticism, blends local lores
and "Christian traditions, honors the

. spirits of those who’ve’ passed and cel-

ebrates the return of shapes, shades
and shadows to our earthly plain.

The Halloween I speak of can be
found at Kmart, Wal—Mart or any other
fine retail establishment of that ilk.
Though as a good socialist, I can’t
advocate anyone actually going. to
these stores. Shop small local busi~
ness! ' ‘

After an extensive survey of the
local Rite Aid, I’ve concluded my
Halloween involves stupid stuffed

witch heads that make cackling noises; V
, one—eyed, one—horned ﬂying purple

people eaters that vibrate while

"singing the kids’ song and several

dump truck loads of pumpkins.
It’s a celebration cloaked in minia-

‘ ture Snickers bar wrappers with blink-

ing orange icicle lights for eyes. and a
vampire—toothed grin. This holiday is
freer than trick or treating and as light

. as cotton candy. And my Halloween is

nothing more than that.

My holiday has nodeeper reli—
gious implications, no moral mes-
sages, no revolution that will not be
televised.

Craptacular in both content and
execution, it’s a day to wear the most
bizarre combination of clothes avail-
able. Halloween is a time to juxtapose
my normal role as writer, roommate
and outlaw extraordinaire with ones
that I never had the balls to assume
before — and those are metaphorical
balls because of, well, that whole

being a girl thing.

Last Friday I became a cop.

l Perhaps “became” is the wrong word

for it. On Friday, after returning from
the upstanding operatic, choral and
dance performance “Carmina Burana,”
I grabbed the handcuffs tacked to my
door, took my “Special Officer” badge

, out of the tin atop my dresser, ‘snatched

my highway patrolman glasses and
became the coolest law enforcement
agent since Jack Webb.

Back to the topicat hand, which
was — oh yeah — Halloween. Costumes
serve the function of letting people
forget the roles they adopt or are
shoved into, letting us escape from
them like circus clowns from a tiny
car. Good girls become hookers. Bad
girls can be nuns. And those in
between, such as myself, can settle for
kicking ass and taking names.

Getting bombed: Can Mary Jane save the world?

‘ For me, few musicians can evoke

the sense of peace and
calm that Bob Marley
could when he sang,
“Everything gonna be all
right. Everything gonna
be all right.” Marley him-
self was no stranger to
turbulent times, but he
still retained his simple,
peaceful beliefs.

‘ Was this inner calm
attributable to his kind,
gentle soul? Perhaps, but

I’d be willing to bet that all the mari-
juana had something to do with it too.

M. Derek Care
Columnist

' With this in mind, it has occurred

to me that America should
try an unorthodox marijua-
na—based approach to
fighting the war against
terrorism. Maybe instead
of bunker—busting explo-
sives, we drop packages
containing a little taste of
Humboldt County’s finest.
Maybe instead of bombing
Afghanistan, we should be
getting Afghanistan
bombed.

My justification for this mission,
which I propose to call _“Operation

Inhaling Freedom,” is this: Stoners
cannot do anything. This scientific
law has been proven hundreds of
thousands of times on college cam-
puses across, America. I know for a
fact that this experiment has been
conducted countless times by Pitt’s
own “unofficial scientists” and the
results of the experiment are always
the same. Stoners can not do any-
thing. Period.

By dropping THC—laden care
packages onto Taliban and al Qaeda
strongholds, America might do what
economic sanctions and bombing
raids have not been able to — cause

terrorists to lose the motivation and
ability to fight. In my mind, the situ-
ation would play out something like
this.

Osama: “Yo dudes. You guys feel
like blowing up an embassy or some-
thing?”

Mullah‘ Omar: “No way man.
I’m not doing anything that doesn’t
involve Cool Ranch Doritos__ and a jar
of nacho cheese.”

Osama: “Check it out. ‘I was
gonna smite the infidels, until Igot
high. I was gonna fight the great
Satan too, but then I got high.”’

. And so on. Naturally, the ultimate
goal of this operation would be to
force bin Laden to call Papa John’s,

I thus allowing the CIA to triangulate

his position. Then, while he sat
around his cave with a large pepper-
oni pizza and a box of breadsticks on
his lap, a special covert operations
group consisting of Army Rangers,
New York City policemen, several
Hell’s Angels and Mike Tyson could
be sent in to finish the job. "

Of course, I am not foolish
enough to truly believe that dropping
packages of marijuana on
Afghanistan would cause al Qaeda
and the Taliban to suddenly become
peaceful. Before that can occur, they
would need some “killer tunes.”

Blackhawk helicopters could be ‘

outfitted with massive speakers that
would blast nothing but “Fire on the

Mountain” over and over again. Not
only would this pacify those who
(‘consumed the care" packages, but
those who chose to stay sober would

also be driven to the brink of insani-
ty.

‘Naturally, this program -would i

have to extend outside the borders of
Afghanistan. To sedate only the ter-
rorists in Afghanistan is to ignore all
the Muslim militants in Pakistan,
Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.
America’s war with drugs must be
prolonged and persistent if it is to
succeed.

It is not enough to simply get
Afghanistan high. America’s enemies
must be‘ sought out in whatever holes
and bunkers they may hide. Then, we
have to greenhouse those bunkers.

So can Mary Jane save the world?
Common sense and practicality say
that this is a ridiculous solution to a
serious and complex problem. But
there is always a chance that Marley
was on to something when he predict-
ed, “And then Georgie would make
the fire lights...Oh, everything gonna

.be all right. Everything gonna be all

right.” .

- Mixing a tape is an art form. It
requires» the utmost respect, thought
and consideration. .

You have to factor intoyour tape-
making equation a few key elements:

Vwhere the tape will be played, for

whom‘ the ‘ tape will be played, and
most importantly, when the tape will
beplayed, especially if it is intended to
be a part of anA event. ~ ’ V

V Compiling a tape for an event
requires the incorporation of both the
obvious and obscure. You need to
incorporate elements of the event, as

well as artists normally associated with

said event.

With all that in mind and the
upcoming parties that are bound to
happen in the name of Halloween, I
present to you the ultimate Halloween
mixtape.

The first song will be something
obvious. I suggest the use of Ray
Parker Jr.’s “Ghostbusters.” Your
intentions should be understood at this
point.

It’s possible that the audience will
not realize your objective, so make
“The Monster Mash” by Bobby Boins
Picket the second track. It’s corny, but
if you have the balls to include this on
your tape, your theme will be clear
beyond ashadow of a doubt.

Now we need to move into the
songs that speak of the customs associ-
ated with the holiday. You need multi-
ple examples in order to show every-
one you didn’t try to just slip one by
‘em. I recommend “I Want Candy” by
Bow Wow Wow, “Murder Was the
Case,” by Snoop Dogg and “Santeria”
by Sublime.

In just three songs you cover trick
or treating, demonic conversation with
Snoop Dogg and a form of voodoo.

_ _ If you’re feeling creative you can
go for the double point score and use

. Rob Zombie’s ‘_‘Dragula.”

Now you need to bring it home
with a strong effort before the grand
finale. Go with “Hell” by the Squirrel
Nut Zippers, something by Trick
Daddyto fulﬁll the need to throw in a
song where the artists name is the rea-
son for including the song, and the
painfully ’ obvious “Halloween” by
Dave Matthews Band.

Finish it off with the mother of all
Halloween songs, Michael ‘Jackson’s
“Thn'1ler,” and your tape is complete.

By now you are undoubtedly say-
ing there is room for a song or two that
should be on the tape. Hey buddy, VI -can
only do so much. Halloween isn’t
exactly -known for having a lot of
anthems. A A A

THE PITT NEWS

v.  ‘ . .- ‘ _

Ghost stories are as much of Pittsburgh’s heritage

as complaining about the Steelers. South Parkis part of _

that tradition ~— it is home to Charlie No Face. These
days, old Charlie is known as the Green Man. Of
course, these days the Green Man is also quite dead.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean he won’t pay you a
visit.

Talk to enough kids at South Park High School
and they’ll tell you the legend of the Green Man. A few
decades ago, some poor sap got struck by lightning and
his skin turned green. He took on ghoulish physical fea-
tures and was considered a monster. At night, he stum-
bled around the woods, scaring unfortunate-trespassers
to his home. He later came across the old B&O railroad
tunnel and crawled in there to die.

Talk to enough grandparents in South Park and
they’ll tell you that the story of the Green Man is true.

Tales of Raymond Robinson’s electrocution were the '

talk back in their high school days. Charlie N 0 Face, as

he was called, lost his arm and had a disﬁgured head. A
Shunned from society, Robinson was forced to, roam A
the roads of South Park, trading photo opportunities for '

beer from strangers. His green ﬂannel earned him his
nickname. He died in 1985, but many say  ghost still '

. haunts South Park.

The home of the Green Man packs plenty of shiv-'
er—inducing qualities. The road to the tunnel, Piney

Fork Road, takes you through a twisty,'one-lane under- '

pass. As soon as you make it through, the eerie roar of
the nearby creek surrounds you; Cryptic" messages‘ like
“Metallica Rules”, and “Jake Was Here” cover the

inside of the tunnel. Because no high school senior _
would ever dare write grafﬁti on a wall, the Green Man p .
himself must have written the messages. The inside is '

full of rock salt that packs a scary“ echo when walked’
upon. It deﬁnitely sounds like you are not alone in
there. 1 . 1 i_ V .

If you plan to visit Green Man’s tunnel, make’ it
quick to avoidthe police, Also, wear old shoes because
they’ll get caked with mud and salt. If you’re one of the _

brave ones, the ultimate dare is to walk through the
nel in the dark. You have to do it by yourself, unless“:  ,  H ,_

Standing in the courtyard of the ‘Allegheny County
Courthouse, eerie silence fills "the air, despite”the fact that
on the other side of the thick stone walls a bustling city
goes about its day. i ' ‘ —

to get down there. ; -

izomlties continue to haunt Monroeville Mall        E

I - It’s been24 years since the living-dead-of George

I Romero’s.second zombie ﬁlm classic “Dawn of the j
I Dead” ﬂocked to Monroeville Mall insearch ‘of the lat-

I estdesigner fashions andrscrumptious human ﬂesh. In
I deference to recent _rea1¥life terrors, the
I mall is not using this year’s Halloween to
I cash in on its legendary standing in horror
I ﬁlm lore. ,

I Even as a non-horror fan, I’ve always enjoyed
_I Romero’s “Dead” trilogy. A Pittsburgh native, Romero
I decided upon the mall as his f1lm’s primary setting
I after observing the blank —— one might say zombie—like
I —— faces of shoppers as they trudged from store to
I store. With the frlm’s overarching metaphor in place,

Roam

he began shooting in late 1977.

Littleat the mall remains from the ‘70s save some .
‘ external ambience and the J '.C. Penney store. As in the

-ﬁlrn, the surrounding trees’ had succumbed to the sea-

leaves, most were bare. A typical 
and overcast Pittsburgh sky added the right

infused into his exterior scenes.  _ » ’ . . I »
I recalled even‘ less of the inside of thefmall. As far

as I could tell, only" J .C. Penney, Ia keyplot ‘location, ‘
I survived" the last _two decades‘. I immediately recog-

nized’ the Penney’s_ second-ﬂoor entrance. I stopped

therefora-bit, contemplating that chunks of___f_ake zom-I '

son. While a few retained their colorful fall :

touch of hopeless despair that Romero

bie brain had once splattered where I stood. Inside the I
store,-I resisted the temptation to slide down the esca- -I
lator divider a la Roger, one of the f1hn’s protagonists. "I

The only‘ other reminders‘ of the  in the entire I
mall were Spirit and Spencerfs Gifts, two Halloween" I
stores which sold zombie masks alongside the likes of I

 ‘,‘Funny_,Bor1es,_” an evil clown, and ?‘Jug_r1_lar Jabber,’.’“I

Majestically wicked

“Nosferatu” and the Alloy
Orchestra

Tonight, 3 p.m.

Byham Theater, $10

(412) 456-6666 s

The shadowy eeriness of black and
white‘ ﬁlm and the frightening image of
vampire Count Orlock combine with an
original live score by the Alloy
Orchestra to present a unique produc-
tion. If you are looking‘ for a scare this
Halloween, the classic silent ﬁlm
“Nosferatu” will be shown at the Byham
Theater tonight, accompanied by a live
orchestra. _. ,

As the ﬁrst ﬁlm in a six-part series’
of events sponsored by The Andy
Warhol Museum and Pittsburgh
Filmmakers, “Nosferatu” features one
of the most frightening vampires in the
history of film. With his pointed ears,
bulging eyes and long, claw-like ﬁngers,
actor Max Schreck creeps among ‘the
shadows to create a character who will
haunt the minds of the audience long

after the ﬁlm has ended. German direc-

tor F.W. Murnau filmed in Transylvania -;
' for the movie, and his dark images of the

Transylvanian countryside are just as
haunting as Count Orlock himself.
‘ The musical score that accompanies

it further enhances the frightening mood .

of the ﬁlm. .Without any sound, images

» such as Orlock’s dilapidated castle may

appear forbidding, but musical accom-

paniment enhances the experience to the‘
point where it encompasses the audi-_

ence in the chilling atmosphere of the
film. '

The Alloy Orchestra, from
Cambridge, Mass., is a three-piece
group featuring electronic and home-.
made percussion instruments. They will
perform an original score. Geralyn
Huxley, the curator of film and video at

the Warhol, said the museum is always -

interested in different ways of present-
ing music with film. ‘
Whether you are enjoy movies,
admire live orchestras or just want to be
frightened on Halloween, “Nosferatu”
and the Alloy Orchestra will sufficiently
satisfy all those tastes tonight.

_ 1/2 "star A

During October even book stores get

into the Halloween_mood by spotlighting
the scariest titles by classic authors such

as Steven King, R.L. Stein and director ‘ I

Tim Burton. Picking up one of these
books is a good" alternative way to get
into the Halloween mood since trick or
treating isn’t appropriate past grade
school. I p ,

In the 21st century classic Halloween
tales such as Edgar Allen Poe’s “Raven,”
Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” and

Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Dr. Jekyll and p 

Mr. Hyde” are still popular.

up Drew Yeager’s first book, “Bitten by ’
Evil,” is a modem-day adaptation of the
A 19th century Stevenson tale of split per-

sonality. But this time, Derrick Vaughn, ’a
tortured artist, is the disease’s victim.

Derrick witnesses the deaths‘ of his

parents. He then baffles psychiatrists by
refusing counseling and locking himself
in his roomfwhere he paints canvas after

“canvas but never finishes‘ a single one.
He gro'ws_frustrated and drops out of .

art school" . to. move to San Francisco.
There he meets Tricia, a young therapist.
The two begin a romance‘, but when

Tricia confesses ‘her love for'Derrick she '
encounters his other personality '—- a dan-Y

gerous, abusive monster. _. .
. Derrick’s alter» ego harasses Tricia’s

best friend, assaults her grandmother and

threatens totake his own life if she con-

" tinues to love him. I _
Tricia is desperate to ﬁgure out V '
~Derrick’s sudden change, ‘and’ using her ’

experience as a therapist, Triciabegins to.

make sense of Derrick’s split personality,

—— it’s love he can’t handle. The therapist
then undertakes a scheme to get Denick

back and to break the spell of his spilt per- .

Basketball team getsfeet wet  

WES BRYANT/PHOTO EDITOR

Panthers’ junior point guard Brandin Knight works
on Chevy 'I‘routman during last night’s annual Blue-
Gold game at Fitzgerald Field House.

JEREMY J ESTER
Staff Writer

The men’s basketball team played its first game
last night, the annual Blue-Gold scrimmage. Even
though the team is young, coach Ben Howland is
pleased with his teams’ play.

“We’re further ahead.than years past,” Howland
said. “I’m excited about where we are right now.”

The Panthers played two 15-minute games. The

Blue team won both games with scores of 39-26
and 40-29. The teams changed as five players
switched teams between games.

In the first game, Donatas Zavackas hit all three
‘shots he attemptedfrom behind the arch. Brandin
Knight also continued his good shooting from
Midnight Madness as he was five for seven from

A the field and three for four on three—point attempts.

The Second game was sloppy as both teams
looked tired. Knight and Zavackas only shot one of
six from the field.

A bright spot was a Mark McCarroll powerful
tomahawk jam that wowed the crowd. J aron Brown
played well as he handled the ball for his team. He
drove to the basket and drew fouls while leading
both teams with seven attempts from the foul line.

Julius Page, last year’s second leading scorer, is
expected to be a scoring threat for the Panthers this
year. Last night, . though, he was inept, shooting
three of 13 from the field and was poor from behind
the arc, missing all six of his attempts.

Howland, though, is not worried. “Even though

Julius didn’t shoot well tonight, he’s been shooting
great in practice,” he said. , 

Chad Johnson, who is in his second season with
the Panthers after transferring from Nebraska, is

the team’s lone senior. Howland said he is pleased ‘

with how the juniors and his senior are taking
charge. '
“-They know the system, they are smart and are
helping the younger kids along,” Howland said.
Even though players such as McCarroll and
Chevy_Tr0utman are freshmen, they benefited from
practicing as redshirts for all of last year.

“Having guys that have been in the program .3

really helps,” Howland said.

This year, freshman Carl Krauser istmuch like
McCarroll and Troutman, in being an academic par-
tial qualifier allowed only to practice. I

Krauser took advantage of the opportunityto
play in front of fans last night. He forced many
turnovers and shot six of seven from the field, hit-
ting three shots from three—point territory. , ,\

Ontario Lett, a junior college transfer, was
impressive as he used his thick 260—pound frame to
cause havoc in the paint. During the season,
Howland hopes to use -him and Toree Morris as cen-
ters. , »

“We got a -pretty good one-two punch wit
Toree and Ontario,” Howland said. _

Howland admits his teams have lacked _a “big-_‘
‘_ man, presence,” and he hopes to use Lett and Toree

Volleyballcan’t take the heat downin Florida

NATALIE KRASMAN
The Pitt News

Pitt’s volleyball team added two more games to the
loss column this week, slipping ﬁiither down the list in
the Big East rankings.

The weekend matchups with Florida Intemational
on Friday and Miami on Saturday dropped Pitt into a tie
with Virginia Tech for the No. 7 seat in the Big East.

The Panthers, now 4-5 within the conference, will
face four rivals before the Big East Championship,
which will be held at Fitzgerald Field Houseon Nov.
16-18.

“With this team you never know what you are going
to get,” head coach Chris Beerman said. “We have day
to day confidence issues that need to be worked out
before we can win.”

The Panthers (7-14 overall) suffered a tag-team
beating in Florida when’ the Florida International
Golden Panthers administered a sweeping upset at the
Golden Panther Arena in Miami 3-0, and the Miami
Hurricanes followed with a 3-1 victory at the Knight

Runners excel at Big East Championships

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

After’ already securing wins.
against rival West Virginia twice this
year, the Pitt women’s cross country
teamfinally got to see what it could
do against the Big East as a whole at
the Big East Championships in the
Bronx, N.Y.

The women wanted to finish in
the upper tier of the conference, and
they did, coming in seventh place.
The men’s team, despite losing two
seniors from last year’s team, stayed
consistent and took 11th place for the
second year in a row.

Head coach Waddie Freeman
commented that no runner on the
women’s team ran her best race of the
year, but the consistency of the run-
ners that gave the team its highest fin-
ish in years.

Only about 19 seconds separated
Pitt’s first runner from its fourth run-
ner.

That first runner was senior
Amanda Schmidt, who finished the
6,000-meter course in 34th place with
a time of 22 minutes, 17 seconds.

“Usually we get a really strong
race out of Amanda,” Freeman said.
“But we still performed well, and
that’s a good sign.”

There wasn’t much of a gap

between Schmidt and Pitt’s second
runner, freshman Maureen
McCandless, McCandless, who has
been either the first, second or third

finisher for the team all season,.

placed 35th at 22:18, just a second
behind Schmidt.

Not long after that, freshman
Lauren Shaffer crossed the line in
43rd with a "time of 22:33.” Senior
Beth Rocks cemented herself into
Pitt’s fourth position early in the sea-
son and has held onto that spot ever
since. Rocks finished just behind
Shaffer in 45th with a time of 22:36.

Not a minute later, Pitt’s consis-
tent fifth runner, Dawn Hilgert,
crossed the line in 63rd at 23:26.

“We were shooting for sixth,”
Freeman said. Sixth-place Virginia
Tech was only eight points ahead, and
fewer points means higher place.
“Last year, the women had 304
points, this year 203. That’s a big
improvement. It was definitely, so far,
the women’s best season,” Freeman
said. 0 -

The season’s not over yet for th
cross country team as the NCAA
regionals still remains.

“Our best finish ever there was
14th or 16th,” Freeman said. “We’re
going to top that this season.” -

Since captains Mike Head and
Justin Wiley graduated last year,

some sophomores, and freshmen led
the men’s team this year. But despite
the lack of experience, Pitt still
equaled last year’s effort at the Big
East championships, taking 11th.

Sophomore Mike Diano had his
finest race of his sophomore cam-
paign coming in 50th for Pitt on the
8,000—meter course with a time of
26:35. Fellow sophomore Dan Hull,
who has been Pitt’s top finisher in a
few races this season,- wasn’t far
behind Diano, taking 53rd with a time
of 26:43.

Freshman Darrell Curtis had some
big races this year and took third for
Pitt this time around with a time of
coming in 59th. Nick
Westerman has- been another key
freshman for Pitt, and "he placed 80th
at 27:26.

Sophomore Clint Kotuby kept '

Pitt’s top five within a minute of each
other by finishing at 27:32, good for
82nd.

“The men were only nine points
out of eighth place,” Freeman said.
“That’s good considering we lost two
seniors.” L

The Big East houses about five of
the top 20 teams in the nation on both
the men’s and women’s sides, and the
competition doesn’t get any easier as
the teams move on to the NCAA
regionals.

Even with its inexperience, the

players such as Lett, redshirt fresh-
man Yuri Demetrus, Johnson and
McCarroll, Howland is pleased with

Even though Howland,.who sat at

Journalism I01  

A Lecture & Learning
Series on Journalism

Tired of just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance
to make news.

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do
journalism. Come learn about how it’s done, and then consider
actually making «history by doing it for the University’s only
independent daily newspaper.
Applications will be available at each talk in case you like
what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just

stop by, learn a little, and talk with the people who already
edit and write the newspaper. ’

, “It’s Always About People:

Writing Better
Features and Profiles.”

P Presented by Marty Levine,

news editor and writer, In Pittsburgh Weekly ‘
