All shacked up
Habitat for Humanity members spend a
week inside the ‘Habishack’ on Union lawn

MAC BOOKER

The Pitt News

It is V cold outside. Very
cold. Some might say it is too
cold to spend a week in a ply-
wood shack. The Panther chap-
ter of Habitat for Humanity dis-
agrees. . '
Its members erected a
structure they call __ the

. “Habishack” on the lawn of the

William Pitt Union on Monday.
They will live in ‘it until Friday,
when it will be disassembled
and relocated. In the meantime,
members hope the shack’s high

visibility will raise student and

community awareness of the
organization.

. Habitat Education Chair
Josh Winans is the only mem-
ber who plans to stay in the

shack overnight for the entire
week.

“This is above and beyond
the call of duty,” said Habitat
President Chris Meaner as he
prepared to bed down on the
ﬂoor of the shack Wednesday
night. . '

Meanwhile, the four other
members spending Wednesday
night in the shack lined the
ﬂoor with a tarp and unread
copies of The Pitt News,fthen
burrowed under a layer of blan-
kets at least a foot thick... “I
want to. sweat in my sleep,”
said one.

The next day, Winans is left
by himself, pacing and circling

the shack to keep warm. “I

hope people drop by,” he said.
“Just to keep me company,
really.” His aspirations for the
shack, however, go beyond per-

sonal conversation.

“We just want people -to
realize that there are a lot of
people who need help and
we’re trying to do it,” Winans
said. “Anybody can join us. We
really appreciate anyone who’s
stopped by to drop off food or
anything.”

Responses have ’ been

‘mixed. One woman came out

on her~lunch break and made
balloon animals for everyone
around the shack. .

There was at least one stu-
dent who was less than enthusi-

. astic.

,“Are you crazy?”, asked
Jaime Anderson. ‘‘Shouldn’t

_you have done this in June? Oh ’

my god
“Well,” Winans answered,

“nobody would have been

around then, would they?”

Bowl ticket prices
halved for students-

MARIO MACHI
Contributing Editor

As a reward for the support they showedthe team dur-
ing its 7-4 season," Pitt is offering students half-priced tick-
ets to the Insight.com Bowl in Phoenix on Dec. 28.

“We appreciate the great support our students have dis-
played this year,” Athletic Director Steve Pederson said.

The tickets, normally $48, will be available for $24 with
a valid Pitt ID at ticket offices located in either the William
Pitt Union or in Sutherland Hall. Students will receive a
voucher that can be redeemed on Dec. 27 at the team’s hotel
(the Doubletree Paradise Valley Resort in Scottsdale) or on
game day at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.

\ “[The students]. have made a tremendous investment in
our football program and were ‘a big reason for our success
this year,” Pederson said. “Offering half-priced tickets is a

way to say thanks and make their trip to Phoenix a little eas- —

Business as usual for
the “chicken guy”

ROB GEBHART
Staff Writer

As a crowd of people drift along
the sidewalk past Hillman Library
toward the busy corner of Fifth
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard, the
man behind the grill calls out to
them, “Dad! What do you want?
What do you want to eat?”

He picks a kid out of the crowd
and asks him, “Dad! What do you
want to eat today?”

“I don’t have any money,” the
kid says.

“I didn’t ask if you had any
money,” the vendor replies. “I asked
what you wanted to eat.”

The young man leaves with a hot
dog and a promise to pay the money
back later on in the day.

That is how business Works for a
hot dog and chicken vendorpeddling
his wares at the heart of Pitt’s cam-
pus inthe shadow of the towering
Cathedral of Learning. Every cus-
tomer is different and each receives
the special treatment one can only
get from a man doing something he
loves and acting as his own boss.

But all patrons must follow the
rules. You can shoot the bull and
joke, but don’t ask any “PQs,” short
for personal questions. _ .

He’ll tell you his name is Scott,
but his last name is a PQ. When he
says, “Everybody’s married. No man
can make it without a good wife and
be happy and successful. You can do
a lot of things but you won’t be ful-
filled,” the assumption is he’s mar-
ried. But when the question is put to
him directly, he just says, “PQ.”

“All I hear is mustard, ketchup,
relish,” Scott says.

He starts each morning as early
as possible and works as late as pos-
sible, cooking as many hot dogs,
chicken breasts and sausages as the
people will buy.

For nearly 12 hours a day Scott is
in his outdoor office, a tight square
space formedby two kerosene grills
and a large chrome vending cart con-

taining the food and condiments. A ‘

giant umbrella above him provides
protection from the sun, snow and
rain.

He can’t remember how long ago
he started vending on the corner but
guesses it’s been five years. Before
that he worked in East Liberty, leav-
ing when the stores closed and traffic
stopped. ‘

Scott began vending in 1983
when the business he worked for

folded. He says he got the idea’ for

‘ his new vocation when he saw a ven-

dor during a trip to New York City.

Scott displays his New York
know-how, calling out, “Hot dogs,
hot dogs, get your hot dogs!” at the
top of his voice.

A 20-something passerby walks
up while Scott is fixing another
man’s dog and and asks what is on
the grill.

The vendor finishes fixing the

frankfurter and turns to an onlooker. ’

“He wants to know what’s on the
grill. But don’t you have to wait in

line at McDonald’s? Anywhere you‘

go you have to waitgin line.”

He turns back to the- man and-

asks him what he thinks is on the
grill. .

The man guesseshot dogs, and
Scott asks him why did you ask if
you already knew.

Don’t ever (ask what is on the
grill. It’s the No. 1 rule everyone

mustifollow. Any violators can’

expect to be harassed.

A hungry college student makes 

this mistake. Scott says, “Now what
do you think is on the grill? You
walk past here everyday and you
don’t know?”

Hamburgers, the student guesses.

Scott points at Fifth Avenue.
“McDonald’s is that way,” he says.

The student asks for a hot dog
and gets it, after Scott collects $2
from him.

The question is why people still
relinquish their two bucks. Why take
abuse from a sidewalk vendor when
most eating establishments promise
service with a smile?

“Best damn sausage,” Matt
Janson says, preparing to devour a
sandwich.

"‘Good chicken,” Jim Presley
pronounces, about to tear into his
grub. “

Throughout the day people yell.

greetings to him from cars zipping
down the street. Pedestrians stop and
chat, not even buying anything. Scott
stops a passing Pitt Pathfinder tour to
ask the visitors where they are from
and to give away some chicken. He
speaks in ﬂuent Spanish with a high
school class in town on a field trip.

He grins the entire time he
works. His eyes are hidden behind a
pair of dark sunglasses, but you
know they’re. shining even without
seeing them. . '

“It’s a choice to be happy. You
can choose to be happy,” he says. It
seems obvious that Scott has made
that choice.

enforce it,” said Councilwoman Barbara
Burns, who represents the North Side dis-
trict. “If it’s not being enforced then
change itto make it ﬁt the needs of today
—— that’s why we ﬁxed it.”

Vendors parked in metered parking
spaces feed the meter all day, effectively
reducing the turnover of the valuable

FROM PAGE 1

_ spaces in front of Hillman Library to zero.

This problem with parking, especially in
Oakland, was the main motivation for
councilman Dan Cohen, who represents
the Oakland district, to add the parking
amendment to the ordinance.

“The No.1 problem with vending is
that they take very valuable parking
spaces,” Cohen said. “Parking is in such

I - demand in Oakland that even taking six to

eight parking spaces makes a difference
every day.”

The parking amendment was added to .

the ordinance right before it was passed
and came as a suiprise — especially to_the
vendors. ‘

“After going through 14 months of

S working on this vending legislation, I

agreed with it 100 percent,” Bonasorte

said. “At the very last meeting they decid-

ed to change the ordinances and drop a
time bomb on everyone — it came from
left ﬁel .”

The new additions to the ordinance,
such as the increased cost of permits allo-
cated to vendors and the creation of a
vending hot line and education services,
pose no threat to current vendors. It is
speciﬁcally the parking issue that has
stirred uneasiness in the vending commu-
nity —— especially the vendors located in
Oakland. Almost all of the vendors in this
area use metered public parking spots.

It is because of the parking amend-

" ment that Bonasorte is suing the city of

Pittsburgh.

“Filing this lawsuit is a 1ose—lose—lose
situation —— we’ve been backed into a cor-
ner,” Bonasorte said. “I’m an American
citizen‘ that is paying everything in life
right here in Pittsburgh and I can’t use a
meter?”

. The legality of allowing certain parties
to park in metered spots was the main rea-
son Mayor Tom Murphy vetoed the legis-
lation. The veto did not stop this legislation
from passing into law, and now this ordi-
nance has spawned what could be a class
action suit with about 15 vendors suing the.
city.

“We think that they are going for the

. jugular vein with the parking and we’ll

take this to the Supreme Court if need be,”
Bonasorte said. “I am very saddened and
disappointed that council feels so strong
and negative against entrepeneurs.”

City council does not seem to be wor-
ried about this lawsuit. Council members
stand conﬁdently behind their ordinance.

“We have the right to say about who
gets the parking,” Burns said. “There is a
lack of enforcement and consistent
enforcement is needed with the parking
problem.”

\ Dan Cohen also stands behind his
amendment. “I think that [Bonasorte] will
lose if he and his attorney are planning to
say that this legislation is illegal or uncon-
stitutional.”

With a slight smile stretching across
his face, Bonasorte offers a temporary
solution to the parking problem. “Maybe
city council should give up their free park-
ing spots downtown.”

More than anything, Bonasorte wants
to remain in his vending location. He is
motivated by his love for his job and the
loyalty he has to the area from which he
and his fellow vendors sell their wares.

“These food vendors have special
types of food and if their clientele wants to
walk to them, wants to stand in the cold,

- wants to sit on the steps or sit on a, park

bench in the rainy cold days, then that’s
what America is all about,” he said.

OPINIONS

EDITORIAL

A possible solution to the
vendor controversy

For a long time, there has
been controversy surrounding the
use of parking spaces by food
vendors outside of Hillman
Library. This controversy reached
a boiling point when the city

9 passed Ordinance 26, which will,

in essence, prohibit the vendors
from doing business where they
are located, effective Jan. 1,
2001.

The main reason cited by the
ordinance’s proponents is that the
vendors use precious metered
parking spaces for their trucks.
While this is a valid complaint,
the parties involved need to reach
a better solution.

The vendors are, after all,
people trying to make a living
just like the rest of us. People also
love the vendors; where else can
you get good, cheap exotic food?
The lines outside the vendors’
trucks at lunchtime prove this.

Plus, Pittsburgh does not
have a reputation for shady ven-
dors like cities such as New_ York
do.

Perhaps a good solution to
this controversy could be to set
up an alternate area for the ven-
dors to hawk their wares. This
way, the vendors would still be in.
business and not lose their liveli-

hoods, and the parking spaces
would be preserved. The vendors

would not have to resort to play- _

ing “musical parking spaces” in
order to keep within the two—hour
parking limit.

Some have suggested the

green plot of land between
Schenley Drive and the Schenley
Plaza parking lot as ideal.
However, we have a better idea:
Why not the space between
Hillman Library and Posvar Hall?
This is currently a vast waste of
space, and putting vendors there
could be a way to not make it as
useless as it is now. It is very
close to where the vendors are
now and would allow them to
keep the same levels of business.

Vendors who could park in
suggested space should, of
course, be regulated by the
University so that it doesn’t
become too crowded. But since
there aren’t that many vendors
out in front of Hillman in the first
place, that should not be a prob-

Hopefully, this is a solution
that would satisfy everyone. The
vendors would still be in busi-
ness, the parking spaces would
still be available and the useless
space will finally have a use.

are, tied to the tracks of obligation as the runaway
train of the holiday season bears down upon us.
Now don’t misunderstand me. The holiday

But there is no one reading ﬂiis right now
who, if he or she were really honest with himself

Thisis especiallytrueinlightofthefactthat
after you spend hours searching online or, even

But you can’t not give your friend or your

cheap that the label reads, “Wine or Dessert Fruit
Topping.” Or — and this takes audacity — green
bean casserole.

Of course, if you spent nine hours cooking ‘

dinner, you probably spent at least 14 decorating
your home and yard. If you ask me, there’s noth-
ing like gloriﬁed aluminum foil stnmg over every
square inch of available woodwork, compliment-
ed by multicolored lights blinking on and olf at a
nauseating 435,000 ﬂickers per second, to make
‘ ’ someone curl into the fetal position
and pray for June.

Of course, such things are
nothing compared to the artiﬁcial
deerherdsthatcanbefound staked
out in suburban lawns across the
United States. Apparently someone misguidedly
decided that such deer were “classier” than your
average Christmas decorations, which, admitted-
ly, have the class of a glob ofused chewing tobac-
co on the ﬂoor of Windsor Castle. . -P

These “classy” decorations look just like real
deer, if real deer were hollow constructs of wire
left over ﬁom summer PennDOT projects, glow-
ing with tiny light bulbs. It’s funny that nature did-
n’t come up with this evolutionary trait on its
own. .

, However, I believe that it was one of these
festive creatures that provided me with the great-
est decorating nuance I have ever seen during the
holidays. While driving through my hometown, I

saw one such deer planted ﬁrmly in someone’s .

yard, except that the front and middle sections of
the light string had burnt out

This, I believe, was the most touching
method I have ever seen someone devise to com-
memorate the birth of my Lord: a glowing deer’s
ass. God bless us, everyone. I

I could go on, but what’s the point? I’ll still
have to buy gifts, mingle with my family and dec-

orate my surroundings, and so will you. Perhaps ,

you don’t even ﬁnd fault with such things; per-
haps you like them. Perhaps you think this col-
umn is blasphemy. I hope you do, because it was
a blast for me too.

Sabrina Spiherir heart is unlikely to grow three
sizes on Christmas morning.

Florida is good

Go outside. That’s right, go out-
side, right now. Feel that? That’s called
cold. Now you’d better get inside again
before you freeze to death.

Imagine, however, that you’re in
Florida. You know, they don’t call it the
Sunshine State for nothing. They call it
that because it is sunny and warm. If
you were in Florida, you wouldn’t be
shivering in the cold like an idiot right
now.

T here’s been an awful lot of
Florida bashing going on lately, and I,
for one, refuse to join in. Who cares
about politics anyway?
Personally, I would rather
watch the Disney Channel
than CNN. Say what you
want about Disney, but
anyone who claims that he
or she didn’t have a hoot at Disney
World is a liar. And where can we find
“The Happiest Place on Earth?” In

. Orlando, Fla., that’s where.

The next time you go to Schenley
Cafe and put an orange on your tray,
stop to ponder it. Admire its perfect
shape, its delightfully craggy surface
and its luminous hue. Perhaps you
should consider shedding a few tears
over its beauty. Do you know where
that orange probably came from? Hard-
working Floridian farmers probably
picked that orange especially for you.

Pennsylvania’s state capital is
Harrisburg. While there is nothing
wrong with Harrisburg, the word lacks
the musical quality of Tallahassee. Go
ahead, say it out loud, I know you want
to. Feel the way it rolls off your tongue.
Try to list in your head how many other
words you can think of that have three
different pairs of double letters in
them. There aren’t many, are there?

Admit it, you went through a phase
when you wanted to be an astronaut.
You have a secret desire to walk on the
moon. You may even have a picture of
Neil Armstrong in your wallet. So you
are probably aware of the historical
importance of Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
the site where NASA launched_ many
rockets, including Apollo 11. That’s
right, Apollo 11, the first manned rnis—
sion to the moon. People walked on the
moon, and it would not have been pos-
sible without the wonderful state of
Florida.

According to my roommate,
Florida also boasts the oldest city in the
United States, St. Augustine. She
seems to think that is pretty cool. And

MELISSA

BALICK

S'r..m«‘ WRITER

 

if she thinks that is cool, then probably
some of you readers do as well. Could
we give it up for St. Augustine, please?
It must be pretty tough to be the oldest
city in the United States. It probably
doesn’t get away with stuff that the
younger cities do, and I’ll bet that it has
to look after Los Angeles and Reno
when the states go on vacation. Then
again, I’ll bet that Seattle and Chicago‘
are pretty sick of hearing, “Why can’t
you be more like St. Augustine?” all
the time.

My grandparents live in Florida,
and I’d be willing to bet that
yours do too. Grandparents
are good, right? For some
reason, they’re still fond of
you despite the fact that
your own parents have dis-
owned you. They may even send you
birthday cards with money in them. I
went to Florida to visit my grandpar-
ents when I was about 5 years old, and
not only did they seem to like me a lot,
but their friends did too. One of them
gave me this really cool stuffed dragon
that has made its way through life with
me, currently living on my bed in my
dorm room. Let me ask you, where
would the grandparents all live if it
weren’t for Florida? 0

Now, as if further proof were need-
ed that Florida is a terriﬁc and Vital
state, I offer you this fact: Florida was
the 27th state to join the union. I know,
it doesn’t sound remarkable, but look
at it from a numerologist’s point of
view. Twenty—seven, when broken
down, is three times three times three.
Three is the mystical perfect number in
numerology. Coincidence? I think not.

Let’s look at the facts. Without
Florida, there’d be no oranges, no
Disney World, no lunar landing, no
oldest city in the United States, and our
grandparents would probably be shiv-
ering to death in Montana right now.
There would be no 27th state to join the
union; we’d just have to skip from the
26th to the 28th. My favorite stuffed
animal might have been something
really boring, like a bear instead of my
funky Floridian dragon.

We’re talking complete chaos here.

We as a nation should be thanking our ‘

lucky stars for having been blessed
with the gift of Florida.

Melissa Balick encourages all readers
to e—mail her at 0ogle_Monster@hot-
mail.com.

POINT coumspomr

Florida  is itworth anything?  

Florida is bad

Florida, how do I loathe thee? Let me
count the ways:

To start, the big limp love organ factor.
If one looks at a map, he will see that
Florida is the enormous ﬂaccid penis of
North America. Perhaps Florida’s limp-

ness makes the country impotent as well.

Otherwise, we would be able to better pro-
tect our interests in other parts of the world.

I also hate Elian Gonzalez’s family
and the whole embargo thing. I really like
Cuban cigars, and I can only get them in
Europe, where I don’t have the wherewith-
al to go regularly. ,

Also, there’s the old peo-

ple factor. I hate them, and
they’re everywhere. They also
have disproportionate inﬂu-
ence and they are greedy. “I
want my drugsl I want my
money! The government should pay my
rent! What do you mean the coﬂee isn’t
included in the buffet? Give me my dis-
count!”
' Where are my free drugs? The gov-
ernment has never offered, nor have I
asked for them, to buy me any of the many
drugs I use to kill me pain of a worthless
existence. At the very least, Congress
could buy the next round for me.

And tl1ey’re slow at everything. I
don’t know if they always drove this badly,
but if so the world must have been a horri-
ble place 50 years ago. And they are loaded
with diseases. I don’t want to see that. So
they run to Florida to disintegrate and die.

I loathe the weather. In Florida, they
have hurricanes, ﬂoods, heat and humidity.
The sun beats down on the concrete that
covers 95 percent of the state and the pop-
ulation lives in a continual sweat bath bro-
ken only by huge killer storms.

I loathe the models. South Beach is
full of those beautiful, anorexic heroin
addicts. They are fascinating and’ exciting.
But not one of them will have anything to
do with me.

I loathe Disney World. If this isn’t the
magic of Florida, what is, right? Well,
although it looks good at first, in the end it
all comes down to unhappy people in

MAC

uncorrifortable suits and a bunch of crappy A

rides. News ﬂash: Space Mountain sucks! .

I loathe spring break in Florida. ‘As
Allen Ginsberg might have said: “I have
seen the best minds of my generation /
Getting mad wasted at Daytona Beach /
And showing their breasts to cameras /
Videos for $19.95 on this one—time TV
offer.”

I loathe Florida’s ass-backward geog-
raphy. Northern Florida is the Old South.

BooKER

 

Southern Florida is the cosmopolitan
North. This is all just to confuse the rest of
us.

have two basic sorts: One is Art Deco, and
this is what serious architects  of as
the Florida style. This is also what brought

aquamarine into our lives. But, the Deco 0

buildings are mainly either falling apart or
have been ﬂattened by hurricanes. ,

The more prevalentfstyle is Modern
American Strip Mall. This has been around
since the late 1960s and is easily recog-
nized by itscinder block construction and
“nasty-ass box” shape.
Buildings in this._style can be

ways, which are all 12 lanes
wide and criss—cross the state
_ in such a tight pattern that one
can never be in Florida and be more than
six ‘miles from a highway in any given
direction. The upside is the ﬂat roof inher-

ent in the Modern American Strip Mall

style. This ﬂat roof gives middle schoolers
a place to get high and try to forget that
they live in Florida.

I loathe "Florida’s college football»

tearris. Could the rest of us have a chance
for a change? I mean, they have the Florida
Gators, Miami Hurricanes and Florida
State Seminoles, three teams that dominate
college football almost every year. Just
because it snows here, there’s no beach,
there are no long—legged ladies in bikinis
Rollerblading through the streets and we

don’t even have ourown stadium any-'

more, that doesn’t mean this isn’t a good
place to be a college, football player.
C’mon. Please? ,

And ﬁnally, I loathe the Everglades.

‘The environmentalists will tell you we

must preserve this because it is one of our
precious and disappearing wetlands. This
is a misnomer. “Precious wetlands” are, in

‘fact, swamps. They are full of alligators,
V malaria-carrying mosquitoes, hillbjllies
and mud. The Everglades are Very nasty .

and will kill you if they get the chance.
Stay away if you valueyour life and don’t
happen to have a bulldozer, a bug Zapper,
all of your shots, some mosquito netting
and a very big gun. If you have the chance,
build some sort of chemical plant; ‘

I Clearly, Florida is an -horrible, evil
place. Never ever go there, unless of
course, your only other choice is Texas.

Mac Booker can be contacted at mac-
booker@hotmail.com, unless you ’re from
Florida, in which case you can send him a
carrier pigeon.

I loathe Florida’s architecture. We 9

Violence

“No One Knows”

NANCY REDDY

Adam Perry’s poetry is an intense and
often urmerving mix of violence and sexual
content. Perry jumps from one surreal
scene to the next, blending
images as diverse as
Jehovah and his choir, a
murder and a romantic

poem His language is
rich and descriptive, with

- lines as enigmatic as “a

ghostly sanity will juxtapose
a sweet undertow” and “a cool organ hums

in the dark Dylan dogma.” V
Perry is an undergraduate at Pitt. This
summer, he worked with fomier beat/hippie
poet Charles Potts. “No One Knows,” his
ﬁrst chapbook, was published by D Press in
November. Perry was also published in
“The Temple,” “Kitty Litter
Press,” ”Adirondack
Review” and other publi-

cations.

' At their best, the
poems are vivid and use
shock value to force the
reader’s attention. Lines like
“And when your face was full
of blood and tears/I pushed open your thighs

and  you remember me” are disturbing
but powerful. However, the lack continuity

throughout the poems is confusing and occa— f

sionally  to distance the reader from

manner that prevents the reader from form-
ing any concrete idea of where the poemis
or who the people involved are. Perry’s atti-
t11des towards women and sexual situations
display a kind of bravado that sometimes
 the reader: However, he moves
away from this in “Suck to Breathe,” the
strongest poem in the chapbook, which uses
violence as a metaphor for the pain of a
breakup. Lines like “I canfeelherinmy ﬁn-

      

  

gers, shaking/trembling” display the kind of
emotional sincerity some of his other work

f , ‘;‘I..ove-Struc ” marks a diiferent tone
from the rest of the poems in the chapbook
This poem describes a kind of archetypal
artist whose touch “brings joy, sadness, and
confusion.” The tone here is idealistic,
almost dreamy, a relief from the tension of
the other poems. This tone also extends into

. “B1onde Ecstasy,” which attempts to

describe the speaker’s idea of a perfect
world. The contrast between celestial
imagery and physical details effectively
work out the contrast between the dream and
reality.

The Rose That Grew
From Concrete

  Vol. I

Tupac Shakur

Amaru/Interscope ‘Records

NANCY REDDY

Staff Writer

Earlier this year, a book of Tupac
Shakur’s poetry, “The Rose That
Grew From Concrete,” was released.
The CD, The Rose That Grew From
Concrete Vol. 1, features 25 of these
songs read or performed by various
artists. The album contains an interest-
ing mix of artists, from Q-Tip and
Quincy Jones to poet Nikki Giovanni
and actor Danny Glover. The second
CD includes. a question and answer
session with Afeni Shakur, Shakur"s
mother.

The album is surprising because
most of it, with‘ the exception of “In
the Event of My Demise” performed
by Outlawz and Geronimo Ji Jaga,
sounds nothing like Shakur’s rap.
Many of the songs feature African

drumming and chanting. However, the
strongest tracks are the simplest.
“The Rose that Grew From
Concrete,” read by Giovanni, is the
strongest on the disc and includes
Shakur reading sections of the poem
himself. The only accompani-

ment is a simple beat

chorus.
“Sometimes I

and a

markedly different
song with a kind of
country/pop ﬂavor to it. .

The album includes two versions
of “Can U C See the Pride of the
Panther,” performed by Mos Def,
which are labeled the “male” and
“female” versions. Afeni ‘Shakur says
that the first, the male version,
“missedlthe intention of the poet” She
explains that the first version is “a
song for the brothers who are in the
party, in the movement” while the sec-
ond is about “the reality of the pain.” I
wonder how she is so sure, four years
after his death, of the’poet’s inten-
tions.

Also, she makes the selection
more political than it really is. At
times, Afeni.Shakur uses her son’s
work as a platform for her own agen—
da. The question and answer disc fails
to reveal anything new or interesting

Old tricks

Chicago the Movie  

Dave Hollister

\

, DreamWorks Records

it

. with

GREG ANDERSON
L, V Staff Writer
When . listening to Dave
Hol1ister’s sophomore album,

Chicago 85  the Movie, it’s hard to
escape the feeling of familiarity that
comes with the bulk of the album’s
13 tracks. .

That’s because you’ve heard it all
before.

There isn’t a sound or style that ‘

hasn’t been used to death by other

V R&B singers. While no one is

expecting Hollister to reinvent the

= wheel, a few surprises or a taste of

originality would be more than wel-

. COIIIB. ‘

t The first song, “Keep on Lovin’,”
is a tired attempt at a danceable club

. ‘ tune. The repetitive hand claps and

guest vocalist K Ci’s unnecessary
background wails and grunts will

T only move people to push the skip

button.

This mistake is quickly corrected
“Take Care of Home” and
“We’ve Come Too Far.” Both songs
feature minimalist production as
they’re backed by sparse drum pat-
terns and a pitch-changing synthesiz-
er melody. Hollister’s voice graceful-
ly rides the tracks that perfectly
match his sedated Vocals and relaxed
presence. '

» After these two songs though, the
album gets caught in a string of
monotony with “You Can’t Say” and
“Don’t Take My Girl Away.” All
three songs share the same .falling-
out-of-love theme and offer little or
no variation in the lyrics.'The mellow
vibe reaches a moment of stagnation
as listeners beg for a change in temp
that never occurs. . A

The clichedsubjects explored on
“Yo Baby’s Daddy” and “I Don’t
Want To Be a Hustler” serve -as
excellent filler“ ‘material. With these
issues being addressed by almost
every R&B singer today, Hollister
would have been better off avoiding

‘them altogether.

The album’s climax, “Doin’
Wrong,” is where,Ho1lister shows his
potential. His songwriting hits the
Ifiark over echoing violins and a
funky bass line — “Mama always
told me ,1 would be just like my
father/Sneak just like him/Creep just
like him/Cheat just like him/Be just
like him.” '

As good as this song may be, it

overall

cannot save the album from being
an;ything‘more than an average effort.
Hollister has to dig himself out of too
many holes; with every quality track
there is a stretch of lazily written
verses and uninspiring production.
 The former Blackstreet member
has potential, and it shows on songs
like “On the Side” and the slow bal-
lad, “Destiny,” but he isunable to
maintain a level of consistency that
would give his
songs any last-
ing appeal.
C h i c a g o
85 ’s subject
matter and
vibe
are too basic to
push Hollister ahead of
an already overcrowded R&B world.

Mountaineers top Pitt
in women’s basketball

KAREN BIELAK

Staff Writer

Poor shooting was the ultimate
downfall for the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team last night, as it lost its Big
East opener to West Virginia, 65-58.

Despite a tied score at halftime,
the Panthers were unable to keep pace
with the Mountaineers, who entered
the contest with a four game losing
streak. But West Virginia found a hot
hand in freshman Kate Bulger, who
propelled her team to its third victory
of the season.

“Tonight’s win was total desire
and determination,” West Virginia
coach Alexis Basil said. “The team
gave all they had. We scored well in
transition and it is just a great way to
start our Big East schedule.”

With the score tied at 41, the
Mountaineers put up 13’ straight
points, including 11 from Bulger, to
take the lead with 7:43 left to play. Pitt
was able to close the gap to ﬁve with
just 47 seconds left on the clock but

could not overtake the Mountaineers.

The Panthers shot just 33.8 percent
from the field and 25 percent from
three-point land. Brooke Stewart con-
tinued to struggle for Pitt, as she sank
only one of seven three-point attempts.

Despite the poor numbers, Pitt fin-
ished with three players in double dig- »
its. Monique Toney led the Panthers
with 13 points while Laine Selwyn
added 10. Mandy Wittenmyer record-
ed 11 points and 12 rebounds for the
double—double.

Bulger led the Mountaineers, who
attended nearby Oakland Catholic
High School. Bulger’s 22 points were
a game-high, as she shot 59 percent
and was two of four from behind the
arc. The Panthers » were able to
force 25 Mountaineer turnovers but
were hurt by fouls, as West Virginia
made 13 of 15 shots from the charity
stripe. ,

The loss drops the Panthers to 3-3
and winless in the Big East at 0-1.

The Panthers will try for a winning
record once again Saturday afternoon
when they host Delaware State.

Panthers have a chance
in tough western division

The current sports scene here at Pitt
is the healthiest it has been in quite
some time. The football team will finish
up its exciting season Dec. 28 at the
Insight.com Bowl, and the
basketball team has gotten
off to a good start as well.

Most critics consider the V
Big East a weak football con-
ference, but basketball is a dif-
ferent story. Currently Seton
Hall is ranked ninth in the
nation, Notre Dame’s ranked
10th, Connecticut is 13th,
Syracuse ‘is 14th land St.
John’s is ranked 24th.

Not only does the Big
East have five teams ranked in
the Top 25, but Villanova and
Georgetown are also receiving votes in
the polls. For the first time, the Big East
has split into two divisions —East and
West.

Rude awakening

Pitt falls behind by 16 at half
en route to 88-74 loss to PSU

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

For a few precious seconds, it
appeared that the Pitt Panthers might
do it again.

Pitt, the last non-conference team
to defeat Penn State at State College,
was behind for the entire game until
Zeliinir Stevanovic hit a three-point-
er to cut the lead to 64-59. Then,
Penn State came back with a 10-2 run
to put the game away, as the Nittany
Lions won their 51st straight home
game against a non-conference oppo-

nent, topping the Panthers, 88-74, at

the Bryce Jordan Center. T

“We’ve gotta improve,” Pitt head
coach Ben Howland said on his post-
game radio show. “It all starts with
our practices.” - -

Senior guard Joe Crispin scored a
career-high 36 points, including
seven three—pointers, to lead the Penn

State attack.

“Crispin’s a good player,”
Howland said. “We just didn’t do a
good job defending him.”

Ricardo Greer and Isaac Hawkins
led the Panthers, who dropped in 17
and 14 points, respectively. The only
problem with the two seniors perfor-
mances’ is that both players were
held scoreless in the first half.

Penn State dominated the first
half, and led 39-23 at the break.

“The first half was where we lost
the ba1lgame,” Howland said.

The opening three minutes of the
game were a sign of things to come
for Pitt, as Joe Crispin hit two three-
pointers and dished _off an assist to
brother Jon Crispin, who nailed a
shot of his own from behind the arc,
to put the Lions up 17-8.

Seabrooks gave the illusion that the

finishing last season with a 22-10
record and reaching the Sweet Sixteen
of the NCAA tournament.

Freshmen Andre Barrett and Eddie
Griffin have already made big impacts
on the team. Griffin was named Big
East preseason rookie of the year. The
Pirates come to Pittsburgh Jan. 13.

Troy Murphy, the_.1999—2000 Big
East player of the year, leads Notre
Dame’s hopes of winning the West this
season. The Irish have eight players
returning, including riflemen Matt
Carroll and Martin Ingelsby.

Mike Brey replaces North
Carolina’s Matt Doherty as head coach.
The Irish come to Fitzgerald Field
House Feb. 3. 1- '

— After losing Etan Thomas to the
NBA and Jason Hart to‘ graduation,
amazingly Jim Boeheim has Syracuse
in contention. Boeheim, entering his
25th season at Syracuse, has his team in
the Top 25 with only one returning
starter, Darnone Brown.

The Orangemen come to town J an,
6. ’

Ruben Boumtje Boumtje and
Kevin Braswell are two of the four
returning starters, coming back to
Georgetown this season. The Hoyas
finished the season strong with a win
over top—seeded Syracuse in the Big
East Tournament and an NIT berth.

The Hoyas, who are off to a fast
start,-cometo Pittsburgh Feb. 5.

. The two teams that Pitt should be
able to overcome in the West are
Rutgers and West Virginia, though
Rutgers may prove to be tough.

The Scarlet Knights have four
returning starters, but losing Dalmtay
Jones will hurt the team. Rutgers comes
to town Feb. 24.

The Mountaineers ﬁnished last sea-
son with a 14-14 record. The team lost
last year’s leading scorer and rebound-
er Marcus Goree to graduation. Head
coach Gale Catlett will rely on center
Calvin Bowman for leadership.

West Virginia travels to Pitt on Jan.

It’s hard to know what to expect
from this Pitt team. There are eight new
faces on the ﬂoor, and the team hasa
lot of work to do before it can be con-
sidered a contender. A

One thing that can be expected is a
tough schedule. In January, Pitt hosts
Miami, Syracuse, Seton Hall and West
Virginia, while
Connecticut, Notre Dame, Georgetown
and Providence. V

Pitt has a good balance of youth .

and veterans, and the team definitely
deserves the samesupport that the foot-
ball team received.

Kenneth Paul is a senior staﬁ’ writer for
The Pitt News and urges everyone to go
to a game for no other reason but to
watch freshman Julius Page in action.

Hoops

Panthers were back on track on
offense, but after two more three-
pointers by Joe Crispin, PSU led 31-
13.

Pitt was down 39-17 .when
Stevanovic made a pair of shots from
behind the three-point line to close up
the score for the half.

The Panthers awoke from their
Rip Van Winkle-like slumber in the
second half, as Greer and Hawkins
stepped up to boost the Pitt score.

Hawkins and Greer, with-some
nice assists from point guard Brandin
Knight, started slowly but surely
bringing the Panthers closer to Penn
State on the scoreboard.

With the score 53-33, Greer went
to the foul line for two shots. The
first one fell, but the second one hit
the front of the rim. Greer got his
own rebound and laid it in. The three-
point play made the score 53-36, and
the comeback was on.

A no-look pass from Knight to
Greer resulted in a dunk, and the lead
was down to 16 points. Two inside
baskets by Hawkins made it a 12-
point game, and Penn State coach
Jerry Dunn called a timeout.

After a hoop by Greer, Pitt was
only down 60-50, making the score
the closestiit had been since the game
was only five minutes old.

Pitt didn’t stop there. A dunk by
Hawkins and three free throws by
freshman guard Julius Page made the

three-pointer, which was the end of
the efforts by the Panthers to come
back. .

Pitt would only get into single
digits once more, when Page made a
layup to make the score 78-69.

Besides Joe Crispin’s career-high
night, Gyasi Cline—Heard scored 18
and Tyler Smith scored 132 for the
Nittany Lions.

Greer ended up with a double-
double, scoring 17 points and pulling
down 10 rebounds. Knight finished
