Car theft, robberies stir Oakland

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Senior Staff Writer

After waking up Tuesday morning, Pitt student
Toni Eckstein was surprised to ﬁnd that her car was no

longer where she had’-left it.

Her 1990 Dodge Spirit, which she parked in front
of her apartment building on Ophelia Street, was

_ stolen sometime between late Monday night and early

Tuesday morning.
“All this time, I’ ve been worried about the home

invasions, and they took my car,” said Eckstein, a ‘

senior social work student “That was kind of a slap in
the face.” ’ : ‘ »

But Eckstein is only one of a number of recent
theft victims. A A A

’ A car jacking occurred on Monday night around
seven A man took the car from the emergency park-
ing driveway at UPMC Presbyterian At the time, the
victim’s granddaughter and grandson * were in the
backseat of the car. ‘ e -

After driving the car a block away to a secluded
area near Children’s hospital, the man stole a coat and
two purses ﬁom the car. He then ran down Fifth
Avenue. ' .

A suspect has been identiﬁed through UPMC’s

surveillance cameras, but has not been apprehended

yet 
Also, an armed robbery was. committed at
Hieber’s Drug Store at 3500 Fifth Ave. at 3 pm
Wednesday. A

The suspect, who police said might be responsi-
ble for“ four other Oakland store robberies, was
described as being a black male between 35 and 40

years old, with curly black and gray hair. He is about
5’8.”, light-skinned, and has a pockmarked face. He
typically wears bright—colored shirts, carries a plastic
shopping bag and displays a, long-barreled black gun.
Hehas not been apprehended.

Thefts have also been occurring on a smaller
scale on Pitt’s campus.

“The majority of our problem is theft,” Pitt police
Chief Tim Delaney said.

To keep their belongings from being stolen, stu—
dents need to be more aware of what they do with
ﬂreir possessions, he said. »

Students tend to be forgetful and leave Valuables
in classrooms and the library, he said, and are then sur-

. prised to later ﬁnd them gone.

Stolen books are a common problem, because
students know the value of textbooks and how to sell

* them , Delaney said. «

“Theft is an opportunity crime,” he said. Don’t
give criminals an opportunity to steal, he added.

Students can protect theirbelongings by leaving
valuables at home or locking them in the trunks of
their cars, instead of leaving them in plain sight,
Delaney said.

But Eckstein, who had her car stolen, said she did
not think there was anything she could have done to
prevent the theft. She had locked her car, and the
police oﬂicer told her the suspect probably snapped
the door handle oﬂ’ to break into her car, she
explained. . e .

. Ecksteindoesnotknow whenorifshewillbe
getting her car back, but she did have insurance on it.

“I’m working on getting a rental right now,” she
said

When Monica Higgins, presi-

. dent of Rainbow Alliance, decided

it was time to tell her mother that
she was a lesbian, her mother react-
ed calmly. ." , _
“I had a feeling,” said
I-Iiggins’s mother to her daughter.
“Monica, you went through an
entire phase in fourth grade when
you wore nothing but sweat pants.”
Higgins’ mother’s accepting
response was followed by a state-

ment of concern —— she feared for

her daughter,’  to Higgins.

. Her mother wondered what

Higgins would encounter in a soci-
ety where “people make assump-

tions based on everything but who «

you are.”

Theta ‘Nu Xi, a multicultural
sorority, presented a forum on
Wednesday to discuss the “societal
 of homophobia. A collection of

'diverse panelists discussed with ‘

students their experiences with the
hardships of coming out, or being

V openly gay.

Elise Delong, a lawyer and
board member of The Gay, Lesbian

‘ and Straight Education Network,
labeled herself as formally t1ans— .

 

sexual. Delong remembered a “par-
ticularly nasty” custody case when,
the very night before a key testimo-
ny, a client called her to confront
her sexuality after the opposing
lawyer had told her client that
Delong used to be a male airline
pilot. The next day, Delong
approached tl’lC lawyer to straighten
things out.

‘,‘I just wanted to clear up a few
misconceptions. I wanted to let you
know that I am not a pilot,” she
recalled telling him. a.

Delong shared other stories
about her 15-year transition into
transsexuality and recalled the
prices she has paid. '

“I still remain an outsider to
my family, and that’s a shame,” she
said. j '

Delong said that after she sent
out hundreds of applications,
prospective employers ignored her
based on her transsexual reputation.

She also lost ﬁve close friends
to suicide because of their inability
to deal with their sexuality, she
added.

I “It would be lying to say that
I’m immune to the feelings of
hatred and rejection,” Delong said.

The term homophobia, accord-
ing to one panelist, covers all fonns

Forum targets   homophobic notions

of ignorance and discrimination
toward homosexuals. T
Homophobia felt like a dis-

ease, said Helene Gosselin, a mem-

ber of Parents, Family and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays, or PFLAG.
Only after it is cured, she added, do
you realize that you had it
Gosselin spoke of her son,
Phillip, who after one semester at
college told her he was gay. She
reacted with shock and denial,

( which led to depression, she said.

Her son realized his mother’s
ignorance of homosexuality and
referred her to PFLAG, an organi-
zation that “promotes the health and
well-being of gay, lesbian and
bisexual persons.”

Upon leaving her ﬁrst support
group.meeting at PFLAG, Gosselin
concluded that gay people were
nonnal people.

“I understand the injustices that
they endure,” Gosselin said, refer-
ring to the gay community. “We
must not wait to aifect change.”

Sean McCarthy, of Rainbow
Alliance, said a homophobic per-
son can break through the per-
ceived notions and false portrayals
of homosexuality through educa-
tional events like Wednesday’s
forum.

Baseba]_I., channel surfing
and a 40 round out night

I Bouquet, page 1

He’s been busy with the fraterni-
ty he is pledging.

Bob has barely had time to
settle in when Jirni asks, “Bob,
wanna play 40 pong?”

“-Do I wanna play 40 pong?
N 0,” Bob replies.

Instead, he heats up some

' leftover ravioli for a late night

snack

“Yo, whose bread is this?”
asks Bob, while he searches for
more food in the refrigerator.

“It’s Chad’s. Go ahead and
eat it,” Aaron replies.

With all the talk of food,
Jirni begins to boast about his
cooking skills. He says that a
few days ago, he made jarnbal—
aya for the group. Desert, too.

_ “You’_re Betty Crocker,”
Gina and Jenni croon. ’

As the night wears on, Gina
leaves, and Chris and Joe arrive.
Seems with the amount of trafﬁc
going through the apartment, the
front door -should be replaced
with a turnstile and manned by a
cigarette smoking, ticket-taking,
mulleted carnie.

Chris begins to eat spoon-
fuls of peanut butter, so he “can
drink more,” while a disgusted
Jenni looks on. Joe talks about
his beloved Boston Red Sox
while Aaron, a fan of the
Oakland A’ s — the team Boston
eliminated in the American
League Divisional Series —
slouches into the couch, dis-
pleased.

As the peanut butter runs
out and the pain of playoff elim-

inations slip their minds, Aaron, .

Bob, Chad and Jirni decide what
to do next.

“I’m doin’ a good job,” he
says.

Hey, guys you wanna go to the malt
shop? How ‘bout we kick off our shoes
and do the hop? Wouldn’t that be neat?

Fifties nostalgia is back in
Westchester County, N .Y. In an effort to
curb underage drinking, county ofﬁcials
are beginning an ad campaign, using
Archie Comics characters as spokes-car-
toons. Bus advertisements featuring
Archie and the gang will be out this
month, admonishing kids not to drink or
use fake ms.

The county seems to think that recall-
ing those glorious times of poodle skirts,
segregation and fallout shelters —— times
that even Nick At Nite deems too outdat-
ed to broadcast — is the key to keeping
kids off booze.

Westchester County has severely mis-
judged the generation gap. The kids
they’r_e targeting have barely heard of MC
Hammer, much less Archie and Veronica.
And who wants to retum to a bloodless
Nation of Stepford anyway?

The National Academy of Sciences
has recommended a saner, but not more
favorable approach. Its National Research
Council and Institute of Medicine pro-
posed a raise in federal excise taxes on
beer — which, in a Sept. 9 press release, is
cited as young people’s preferred alcohol
beverage. This, it said, would lead to a
decrease in underage drinking.

It, in fact, will lead to people drinking
cheaper beer than they currently are.
Teenagers have more disposable income

than almost any other demographic, so

while the rest of us are drinking Crap
Brand Beer, will this actually act as a
deterrent?

The Academy reports that the United
States spends an inordinate amount on
enforcing drinking laws — money it
wants to recoup with a higher tax, though
the report does not suggest an amount.

In Pittsburgh, recent raids on Oakland
bars such as Curnpie’s Restaurant and
Lounge, Denny’s Bar and Bootleggers,

show exactly how this money is being A

spent — on Bureau of Liquor Control
Enforcement ofﬁcers and state police.
Stopping underage drinking falls to them,
and taxpayers already pay for their ser-
vices. .

Why doubly charge the of-age citi-
zenry — in both general and speciﬁc lux-
ury taxes? ‘ ' .

It’s true that the country needs the
money, with states going bankrupt and the
economy sluggish. Despite our desire to
return. to the prosperous, puritanical ‘50s,
we can’t, not with everyone having budget
crises. '

Why not just be honest and say that
the nation needs the money .—— to pay for
underage drinking enforcement, education
or other under—fr1nded programs?

Both methods — taxes and comic
book ads — seem to only tangentially
address underage drinking-, through
watered-down dissuasion rather than
enforcement.

Do we really need another Starbucks?

Common knowledge dictates that in
densely populated areas — cities and
especially college campuses — things
spread quickly. Diseases like the Black
Plague and gonorrhea have done the most
damage in crowded localities. The latest
epiderrric to sweep Pittsburgh is some-
thing even more sinister — Starbucks.

Starbucks’ presence in this city is
obviously nothing new. It’s practically
law that, if a place is developed enough to
have paved roads and trafﬁc lights, it
must also have at least two Starbucks.
Part of what initially attracted me‘ to
Pittsburgh when I was apply- ‘
ing to colleges, though, was
the relatively low ratio of
Starbucks to other local,
independent cafes.

I have been here not two

ratio is changing. Starbucks
apparently has some sort of
radar. This piece of equip-
ment must be more thorough
than even the CIA’s most
technology,
and it has unfortunately.
detected not just one, but two

coffee shops on Craig Street.- Both are

making money —- and neither are
Starbucks. ‘

This is obviously a problerrr, and so
Starbucks is doing what they do best:
opening up right across the street from
locally owned and ﬂavored businesses,
selling essentially the same product, and
charging more for it.

Let me assure you, I have done my

I research. A Kiva Han cappuccino, while

$.06 more expensive, has an extra shot of
espresso in it, and their caramel late, the
equivalent to Starbucks’
Macchiato, is $.83 less.

Both Kiva Han and Craig Street
Coffee are just as suited for sitting with a
laptop and a coffee or something to eat as
any Starbucks. More importantly, the

proﬁts both places earn stay local instead
of being ferreted away to corporate bank
accounts across the country.

As these suggest, there are alterna-
tives to the bland, faux—cozy decor, which
has become standard-issue in just about
every coffee-selling national chain.
Starbucks is using your money to buy the
same shades of beige and brown paint
and slightly_quirky larnpshades that are
blanketing the entire country, if not the
world. Wouldn’t you rather your money

be spent right here in Pittsburgh, on non- ‘

crappy—looking lamps?
Anyone near" Craig

Street clearly has options if ,

they want to squelch their
caffeine cravings. There is no
need for another coffee
place, and in fact, there may
not be enough demand _for
lattes and hot chocolates to
support three businesses in
such a small area. This isn’t a
concern for Starbucks, which

nite amount of time.
' Even if the new’ shop

Starbucks’ pockets are deep. There may
never be crowds of people huddled under
ugly lamps, but every cup of hot choco-
late and slice of biscotti means something
to a small business. Another coffee shop
on the block,’ especially one with a well-
known name, will slowly siphon cus-
tomers from their usual haunts. These lost
customers will not go unnoticed.

The simple answer? Don’t go to the
new Starbucks. If you simply must have
a brand-narne cup of coffee, there are
carts in practically every campus build-
ing. Or, if you're feeling especially
adventurous, try going somewhere new.
You might just like it.

Hitler, J and Amold: image shouldn’t control politics

Sure, I’d heard about the recall. I’d even heard that the
guy from “Jingle All The Way” was one of the candidates.
Then I heard it wasn’t Sinbad running, but Arnold
Schwarzenegger, world traveler and bon vivant, star of

_ “Hercules in New York.” So I snuggled under my Sinbad-_

themed bedspread and went back to sleep.

Weeks later, I woke up and John Goodman was the
president on “The West Wing.” Perhaps more
importantly, Arnold Schwarzenegger had
been elected governor of California. The
Office of Homeland Security raised its
Absurdity Alert Level to orange, urging citi-
zens to don protective masks of ironic detach-

So for those of you like me, with heads
spinning from this blink-and-you’ll—miss—it
campaign, I’ ve pieced together _a quick analy-
sis. There will be no discussion of the issues,
because they are boring and complicated, and
Arnold says he’ll explain everything soon

  

J ess/Le iH1Cl(S

Columnist

Arnold’s detractors refused to acknowledge 

sophistication, but he has a better grasp of modern politics
than most people realize. The New York Times quoted a
gushing Arnold, from his book proposal, “The feeling like
Kennedy had, you know, to speak to maybe 50,000 peo-
ple at one time and having them cheer, or like Hitler in the
Nuremberg stadium. And have all those people scream at

you and just being in total agreement with

‘ whatever you say.”

Sure, there’s a fair amount of political
space between Hitler and Kennedy: one
started World II and the other averted the
third. History might remember one as a mass
murderer and the embodiment of evil and the
other as the ﬂoppy-haired King Arthur of ide-
alism, but, hey, they both got people to cheer.

Arnold understands that modern politics
aren’t about history. Tlley’re about movies.
In movies, it doesn’t matter if you play the
hero, Kennedy, or the Villain — tl1at’d be

 

enough.
' Let’s start with the masterful use of
movie references. His catchphrases, running the gamut

from “The Terminator” to “Terminator 3,” were subtly re-

contextualized —— to refer to politics! The genius in this
strategy is that ‘Total Recall” now referred to his political
adversaries, whom he would “terminate.” The California
Voters uttered a collective, “Oh, yeah! Like that movie!”
And the media went, “We love movie puns!”

'VV1sely, though, he distanced himself from “Batman
and Robin.”.Admitting to that movie would have been a
political mistake not even a sophisticated Austrian accent
could undo. / .

Hitler — as long as the people cheer. Actions

don’t matter as much as adulation; star power

trumps substance. The goal of the Schwarzenegger cam-
paign was to keep them clapping. '

A quick example of how this works: during the cam-

paign, a lot of people, women mostly, complained about

’ being groped by the govemor—to-be. A serious accusation;

how do you defuse it? By making sure women holding
“Remarkable Women for Amold”. posters showed up at
every rally. And they were clapping! The message: There
are women here and Amold’s not groping them — isn’t
that remarkable? Now don’t you feel silly for asking about
those sexual harassment accusations? Just go with the

ﬂow, babe. - ’ '
If you don’t go with the ﬂow, you get into messy

questions of character and leadership. You’d have to ask if -

character is more than being charismatic for the camera -
ask Hitler documentarian Leni Riefenstahl about his

, onscreen presence. You rrlight realize there’s a difference

between fantasy and reality, and even if there weren’t,
would you really want the T-800 rtmning your state? A
machine whose sole problem—solving skill is to put a bul-
let between the eyes of whatever gets in its way?

You’d have to ask whether a celluloid leader is any
leader at all. .

Then again, he can lift a lot, and most political battles
are settled in the gym, where the guardians of the Republic
gather to bulk up and snap towels at each other. Gray
Davis and his tiny Tyrannosaurus arms never ﬁt in there.
He wouldn’t stand a chance against a liquid metal T1000.

Oh, there I go confusing politics with movies again. I
suppose it’s because they both trade in dreams. America
itself is a dream, but a difficult one because it has no
Hollywood ending —- the dream is ongoing, moved for-
ward by the true leaders and visionaries. And citizens.

The movies offer a much easier dream, where the
action hero is always right and every solution comes out
of the barrel of a gun. They are escapist, a two—hour
reprieve when the real dream gets too diﬂicult or complex.
Screen heroes are two—dimensional by nature’; their power
lives only in scripted fantasies, not in the real world. On
the screen is where they belong.

addressed here.
Compounding the issue is
that cab companies claim
that their drivers are not

therefore the companies can-
not tell the drivers when,

Norrington, “Pirates of the Carribean”

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2003

Last week, the Motion Picture
Association of America decided to
ban ' the distribution of VHS and
DVD screener copies of movies to
members of the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences for
their consideration come Academy
Awards voting time.

Previously, studios would send
copies of their ﬁlms to Academy
voters so that they could win one of
the coveted Oscars, or at the very
least a nomination — both sure-ﬁre
ways to boost the amount of money
a ﬁlm makes at the movie theater.

This year, however, the MPAA
and its chief, J ack Valenti, have
made the monumentally awful deci-
sion to stop this practice. The MPAA
claims screeners are being used to make pirated copies
of ﬁlms that get downloaded off the Internet and,thus,
effect how muchmoney a film makes at the box ofﬁce.

While the decision isn’t a surprising one —- we are
a nation in the grips of pirate fear, after all — it’s just
the latest poor choice made by Valenti and the MPAA.

The ﬁlm industry is one that has struggled since the
‘50s to make enough money to stay solvent and to keep
people coming back to the movie theater. The biggest

Yet another Internet piracy ﬁght

hurdle the industry has had to over-
come is home video technology.
When the VHS tape and recordable
VCR were introduced, Valenti went
on the offensive, saying the technol-

back of the dying motion picture
industry camel. He took a similar
stance when DVD technology
began to gain a foothold in the mar-
ket and the recordable DVD player
loomed on the horizon.

Both of these technologies are
the reason the industry stiﬂ exists.

‘Studios got the ingenious idea
that by co-opting the technology
rather than ﬁghting it, they could
make big bucks in a largely
untapped secondary market. A film

doesn’t do all too well in theaters? That’s OK, put it out ‘

on video or on a special edition DVD and recoup some
money that way. _

On top of these problems, the MPAA, through its
-antiquated ratings system, has alienated adults —-
adrnittedly only a minority —.— as well as ﬁhnmakers, by

‘ forcing edits in sexual content in ﬁlms that are geared

to a more adult audience. If a ﬁlm gets tagged with an
NC-17 rating, most theaters won’t run the picture and

ogy was the straw that will break the .

industry worse. ‘I .

chain video stores, like Blockbuster, won’t stock it -— -
studios lose money, thus they succumb to the prudish V

pressure of an aging authority group.

In the case of the screeners, the MPAA is combin-
ing both of their failures — technology and ﬁlmmaker
relations — into one nasty, ugly package.

. By prohibiting the distribution of screeners, , the
MPAA is taking a retroactive approach that will do
more harm than good to-a problem that does need to be
addressed, just not this way. The irony here is that the
actions of the MPAA are meant to strengthen an indus-
try constantly ﬁghting for its existence — but the
actions they have taken to do it are going to make the

Piracy of ﬁlms is a problem. But it’s oiie that is
much easier to curb than downloading music. At sneak
previews now, security awaits audience members to
search for recording devices by means of looking
through bags, waving the metal detecting wand over
you and patting you down if necessary.

Obviously, you can’t pat down a DVD. But you can

electronically code the things individually so that if a ‘ I

pirated copy of a ﬁlm made from a screener shows up
on the net, then the MPAA can know exactly from
whose screener the copy was made and the appropriate
action can be taken. Sure, it’s an expensive proposition

Intolerable Cruelty

Directed by Joel Coen
7i‘rsi‘r1/2

Writers/directors the Coen brothers go
frighteningly » mainstream with
“Intolerable.Cruelty-.” It’s a pleasant com-
edy, but it’s rather below the brothers,
whose best ﬁlms are small, dark, intelli-
gent, edgy and unique. “Intolerable” is

big, bright and easy entertainment.

The ﬁlm has some distinct Coen
moments — a producer stabbed with his
‘daytime TV award, an elderly woman tes-
tifying the details of being her husband’s
sex slave, a show-stopping misfortrme
involving an inhaler. But even those are
played more broadly and eagerly than
you’d ever expect from ﬁlmmakers who
gained a following making decidedly
cerebral ﬁlms. '
‘ The discrepancy may be due to the
fact that the Coens originally wrote the
film eight years ago .— for someone else
to direct. The script is nowhere near as
daring or intricate as the ones they rou-
tinely write for themselves. '

x

Miles Massey (George Clooney) is
the ﬁlm’s central contradiction: a romantic
divorce lawyer. He’s at the top of  game
— his notoriously “impenetrable” prenup-
tial agreement is on the. curriculum. at

Harvard Law — but he’s bored and look- i ii

ing for something more. While foiling her
attempt to take all of her husband’s money
in a divorce she manufactured, Miles inad-
vertently becomes obsessed with
Marylirm Rexroth (Catherine Zeta—J ones).
Miles wants love, but Marilyn’s still deter-

mined to get her fortune — she  
ately goes on the hunt for another rich hus- ,

band to swindle — and wouldn’t'mind
beating Miles at his own ‘game while she’s
atit. . - _

C1ooney’s typical swagger works well
here — his version of the ace leading man
who goes soft is ' appreciable enough.
Likewise, Zeta-Jones is ﬁne as the beauti-
ful ﬂower that’s really a predator. Neither
of them has to do much stretching.

It’s the ‘supporting cast that disap-
points. When you’re actors’ favorites like
the Coen brothers, you can get pretty
much get anyone you want for even the
small roles, but that doesn’t mean the parts
deserve the actors. In particular, Geoffrey
Rush and Cedric the Entertainer have pre-

cious little to do. Their scenes tease the
audience with characters who deserve
more depth- »

On the technical end, the whole affair
is well executed. Both frequent Coen col-

laborators, cinematographer’ Roger
Deakins gives the ﬁlm a bold, surmy look
and composer Carter Burwell lends a live-
ly score that’s frequently punctuated with
Simon and Garﬁmkel songs.

   

Overall, the ﬁlm is reasonably high- ‘

end in the spectrum of recent romantic
comedies, if not in the Coen spectrum. But

_ really, . when ﬁlmmakers like Soﬁa

Coppola, Clint ‘Eastwood and ‘Quentin
Tarantino are currently coming through
with the goods, how_liigh is “The Coens
go to Hollywood” — I mean “Intolerable
Cruelty” -— on your list? ~ ‘ ‘

' between two kinds of product: studio ‘

‘ are made — on stupid assumptions.

Odissi dance entices the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater

Graceful and dramatic, “Shatarupa:
Splendorous Myths and Divinities of India,” comes
to the Kelly—Strayhorn Theater this weekend to cul-
tivate our minds and enrich our knowledge of Indian
dance and celebration. This production is a collabo-
ration of dance, drama and classical Odissi choreo-
graphies led by artists from India and Pittsburgh.

_The program features the Kanchi Abhijan dance

performance while the entrancing mythology of
India comes to life on a colorfully costumed stage.
The ensemble creates the grace and beauty of
the Odissi style, an Indian classical dance from the
eastern Indian state of Orissa. There is evidence that
this particular style was performed in temples of
Orissa as far back as the second century B.C. and
originally served as a sacred ritual dedicated to the

gods. Odissi stands out as a sensual, lyrical, and soft
dance that captures the devotion and divinity of the
temples of Orissa. I

In the Shatarupa performance, dancers entice
the audience with their eyes and the subtle, tech-
nique—oriented gestures made with their hands and
manifested in their precise footwork. There are five

wondrous legends in this program about Indian gods ,

and goddesses. The Mardala, also known as
pakhawaj, small cymbals, a flute and veena — a
stringed instrument similar to the sitar — typically
accompany the Odissi dance.‘ «

Srishti is a Pittsburgh—based dance company led
by Sreyashi Dey, an accomplished dancer in the

Odissi and Bharata Natyam styles. She has been

recognized, through many prestigious dance

awards, for her noteworthy footwork technique,
graceful movements, gentle hands and alluring
eyes.

The company’s mission is to present India’s cul-
tural heritage through dance, music, theater and col-
laboration with artists from around the world. This
show will feature two dance troupes from India:
Dey with Guru Manoranjan Pradhan, and the Odissi
Troupe. The show will have English narration.

“Shatarupa: Splendorous Myths and Divinities of
India ” plays at the Kelly—Strayhorn Theater, located
at 594] Penn Ave. in East Liberty, Sat, Oct. 1] at 5
p.m. and Sun., Oct. 12 at 3 p.m. Admission is $8for
students. Call (412) 363-3000 for more information.

for studios to take such an action. But in
the long run, the money studios spend to
prevent people for seeing their movies
for free will be recouped either at the
box office or when the DVD is released
for sale. Again, working with technolo-
gy rather than ﬁghting it could do the
trick. ’

The bigger issue isn’t the monetary
hit, despite the claims of Valenti —-— who
needs to step down from his post,,not
right now but yesterday; he’s out of
touch and is holding back the industry
—— but the effect this will have on inde-
pendent and small—budget ﬁlmmakers.

Studios can afford’ to put a lot of
money behind a big budget film to get
Academy voters ‘a chance to see it so
they can, hopefully, vote for it. But .
smaller production houses and indie
ﬁlmmakerscarmot. The only way that
voterscan seethe smaller films, in many
cases, is by receiving these screeners.
What results, then, is a disparity between
the small, really good movies that can’t
be seen and the larger ones that mightbe _
good but are easier to see. Big movies
will make money and smaller ones
won’t, thus effecting what kinds of films
get made. . .

Robert Altman was quoted on the
Internet Movie Database on Oct. 2, say- '
ing, “It will create this separation

product and independent product. It’s
just a stupid assumption that this will
stop piracy.”

Indeed, the MPAA’s decision is
based on a “stupid assumption.” But
that’s how most of their major decisions

Unfortunately, this time around, not
only will struggling filmmakers — writ-
ers, actors, producers, directors and tech-
nicians — be harmed by the MPAA and
Valenti’s wrongheaded decision, but
films deserving to be seen and recog-
nized will not receive their audiences
and accolades. ‘

A bourbon, a princess, a beer

Lancaster, Pa. native Monique
Oritz and her accomplices will bring
the sultry and grimy sounds of
Bourbon Princess to Busker’s Friday
night.

Sometimes, a performer’s
moniker can be entirely indicative of
his or her style, and such is the case
with Bourbon Princess. Fronted by
the seductive Oritz on vocals and
bass, and featuring the ambient tones
of former Morphine members Dana
Colley on sax and Jerome
Deupree on drums,

Bourbon Princess
comes off like the
sonic equivalent
of a good bour-
bon —- simulta-
neously harsh and

soothing, with a lush

and heady ﬂavor.

Having moved from

‘Pennsylvania to Cambridge, Mass. a

few years prior, Oritz released the
first Bourbon Princess album,
Stopline, in 2000 as a largely solo
effort —— both financially and artisti-
cally. Since then, Deupree has
become a permanent fixture of
Bourbon Princess and the band has
garnered a record deal with
Massachusetts indie label Accurate
Records.

The band’s latest release, Black
Feather Wings, sounds like pure noir
for the ears. The bassy, dark rhythms
of the album evoke images of smoky
rooms and shadowy, figures.
Lyrically, themes run the gamut from
sex and drugs to hypocrisy, and all of
the other moody fodder provided by
the underbelly of the human condi-
tion. A sort of new—age jazz pervades
the album, the kind of sound that
must be heard live to be truly appre-

ciated.
B o u r b o 11
Princess, pos-
~  sessed of a
very unique
sound per-
fect for the
small club
atmosphere, is
more than ="ener—
getic enough to entertain
and should provide the perfect
sounds to chill to for the evening.
Catch the performance, have a stiff
drink and brood away with the best of
them.

Bourbon Princess plays Busker’s in
the Strip District Friday night at 9

—p.m. Tickets are $5. For more infor-

mation, call (412) 355-0911.

Panthers p
P for Fightinglrish

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

As the Panthers get set to take on the

Fighting Irish this Saturday, they can’t help
but feel some of theadded excitement-that
comes with a game against Notre Dame.
Notre Dame (1-3) is one of the most sto-
ried and proliﬁc programs in the country, and
although the Irish are otf to a slow start, the
Panthers know what a great opportunity they
have in front, of them. Seniors like fullback
Lousaka Polite know what a momentous
occasion this is, especially after letting the
“_ game slip by the two previous years. 1
“When \you’re younger, all you hear
about is Notre Dame,” Polite said. “Just the
opportunity to play them is an honor, and to
beat them would be an even bigger memory,
so a win against Notre Dame would be

prepare

huge.”

Senior wide out Yogi Roth was actually.

on the sidelines for a recruiting trip when Pitt
last beat Notre Dame in the ﬁnal game ever
played at Pitt Stadium. Roth shared Polite’s
outlook and knows just how much gam
means for the program. . '
“ThisisthereasonIcametoPitt,”Roth
said. “It’s like I told‘the guys, I remember
every single play from every time we’ve
played them. This is a game that we’re going
to remember for the rest of our lives.
Hopefully we can do what we did four years
ago.” . ‘
For the Panthers to be successful on
Saturday, they will need the defense, the sec-
ondary in particular, to improve. In the last
two games combined Pitt’s secondary has
allowed 778 passing yards, ﬁve touchdowns,
70 completions, only three pass break—ups,

 

and have had no interceptions by comer-
backs. V C
In order to slow the Notre Dame aerial

THE PITT NEWS

Irish try to bounce back

JoE HETTLER
The Observer (U. Notre Dame)

(U-WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind. - At 1-3,
many Notre Dame football fans may not
like the team the Irish put on the ﬁeld every
Saturday.

Coach Tyrone \V1llingham couldn’t
disagree more.

“I’ve gone on record at some point of
saying that I like our football team,”
VV1Hingham said. “We could be very easily
sitting here right now being 3-1 and not 1-
3. I like a lot of the things that I’m seeing
from our football team.”

Willingham believes the biggest task
facing his team is staying positive in the
midst of the adversity they, are facing this
season. If the Irish can do that, Willingham
thinks the team can turn around their slug-

-gish start.

,“I would like to believe [staying posi-
tive] is a natural process of who I.arn and
what I do because I think I’ve ﬁgured out
there’s not much you can accomplish by
being negative,” Willingham said, “Even
though there are many around you that
choose that, maybe even wish you to go
that route, I don’t think you can accomplish
anything.

“Hopefully our football team is paying
attention to its leadership. If it does, it will
stay on the positive track.” _

Wﬂlingharn has a history of turning

around poor starts. His 1999 Stanford team '

started the season losing several games
before ﬁnishing 8-4 and 7-1 in conference
play — good enough to reach the Rose
Bowl that season. ‘

Willingham said he thinks the Irish can

have that same type of turnaround, but they ‘

can’t try and win all their remaining games
at once. The team must take it one game at
a time.

“What we have to continue to do is
continue to improve, believe in self, the
individualand team, and I think we can get
some things done,” Wﬂlingharn said. “But
it is impossible to write that story that
you’re writing unless we do it game by
game. I

“Our focus carmot be all that we have
in front of us, but simply Pittsburgh this
week.” 1

Notre Dame had its ﬁrst of two bye
weeks last week, and that gave the coach-
ing staff a chance to reevaluate goals and
set new ones for the remainder of the sea-
son.

“We set goals for the season, which
obviously have to be readjusted as you go
through the season. We set goals for indi-
vidual areas that we look at each and every
week to see if we can hit those targets,”
Willingham said. “We’re constantly doing
that, constantly trying to provide goals,

areas for our team to really point, direct
themselves to — direct themselves to help
us be a better football team.”

But Wllingham knows that none of
the team’s goals will be reached unless
they begin acting on them instead of

believing in them. _

“Obviously we’ve got to do some
things better,” he said. “That is the key to
what we’re doing. Believing and not doing
things better doesn’t get us anywhere. We
have to put it all together.”

Defense looks to stop freshman quarterback

Notre Dame, page 9

Moore went down with an injury at Texas
A&M, freshman Clint Session ﬁlled in bril-
liantly with a team—high 12 tackles. The
promising young_freshman will be a player
to watchon Saturday. '

On the other side of the ball, the‘

Panthers will look to continue to put up
astounding numbers. 

Quarterback Rod Rutherford is averag-
ing 316.75 total yards per game and contin-
ues to lead the nation in passing eﬂiciency
with a 182.64 rating. . -

Lany Fitzgerald hasbeen Rutherford’s
favorite target and is leading the nation in
receiving yards per game with 145.75.

The Panthers should have starting tail-

back Brandon Miree back on the ﬁeld for

Saturday’s game. Miree was forced to sit out
with a calf injury against Texas A&M, but
was able to practice this week with the aid of
a brace. — p

“I got the results back from my MRI
and they were negative,” Miree said.
“There’s no fractures or anything, so I’ll be
ready to go.” ' ‘

The bye
week came at the
right; time, giving
the Panthers an
extra week of
much needed
rest.

After two
consecutive road
games, the
Panthers return to
the ﬁiendly con-
ﬁnes of Heinz
Field and will be
playing in front
of a sellout crowd
on Saturday. The
veterans on the
team "appreciate
the newfound
home ﬁeld advan-
tage even more.

“It’s been a complete 180,” Polite said.
“When I came here in ’99, we’d be lucky to
get 20,000. But now pretty much every
game is close to ﬁlled up and that’s exciting
and it shows that our program has turned

yard completion for the touch-
down. Sanson added the extra
point, and after a Panthers punt,
he hadpa chance to put the Irish

in the lead with a ﬁeld goal.

On the last play of the ﬁrst
half, Sanson’s 45-yard ﬁeld
goal was blocked by freshman
Scott McCurley, giving the
Panthers “added momentum
heading into the locker room

“They never went away,
though,” said quarterback
David Priestley, who did not
play against the Irish. . _

Priestley had started the
previous three games, but
injured his throwing shoulder in
last week’s loss to Miami and

A was unable to play.

The third quarter was all
offense for both teams; 27
points were scored in the frame.

Pitt tallied ﬁrst when
Barlow scored the ﬁrst of his
two touchdowns on a three yard
run. Lotz added his second extra
point to put Pitt up, 17-10.

The Irish ‘came right back

to tie the game on a trick play.
David Givens received a
pitch on what appeared to be a

reverse play, but he stopped and ,

found Bobby Brown open in

the end zone for a 21-yard

touchdown pass. V
Brown had a career day for

the Irish, with 12 receptions for

208 yards and the touchdown.

' Brown’s 12 catches put
him one reception short of the
school single—garne record at
Notre Dame.

Pitt scored on its next pos-
session, as Lotz kicked his sec-
ond ﬁeld goal, a 33-yarder. It
was set up by another trick play,
this time by the Panthers.

Turman gave the ball to
Barlow, who ﬂipped it back to

Turman then launched the
ball downﬁeld and found Grim,

who made a 47-yard catch even

after being interfered with.

Pitt got the ball back after
an Irish fumble, and the
Panthers turned it into seven
points.

Bryant scored his second -

touchdown of the day, catching
a 23-yard pass from Turman on
a sideline route. The Panthers
had their biggest lead so far at
27-17. -

“I can’t say enough about
Antonio and Latef,” Harris said.
“They’ve both stepped up game

I after game.”

Notre Dame clawed its
way back into the game with
another trick play. Jackson
found‘ Givens in the end zone
for a 27-yard touchdown on a
ﬂea—ﬂicker play. Jackson gave
the ball to Tony Fisher, and he

ﬂipped it back to Jackson.
Givens got behind the Panthers’
secondary and cut PitI’s_lead to
three.

The teams traded ﬁeld
goals, a 44—yarder by Lotz and a
39—yarder by, Sanson, and the
Panthers were up 30-27.

Jackson made his only mis-
take of the day on the next’ drive,
when he ﬁred a pass into the

middle of the ﬁeld. Ramon‘

Walker drilled the intended
receiver and the ball popped
into the air. McCurley came
down with the ball and ran it 15
yards into Notre Dame territory.

Pitt then took time elf the
clock by running Barlow. He
picked up two hugewﬁrst downs-
and culminated the drive by
scoring from two yards out with
a little more than two minutes
remaining. "

It turned out to be the last

touchdown scored in Pitt f

Stadium. The Panthers won, 37-
27. ‘ ,

Notre Dame turned the ball
over on downs after the Barlow
touchdown, but. the students
rushed the ﬁeld and tore down
the goal posts.” ,

Notre Dame .head coach
Bob Davie conceded the game
rather than try toget the students
off and ﬁnish the nine seconds.

Turman» led ‘the offense,
completing 10 of 27 passes for

231 yards and two touchdowns.

Pitt also got big games
from Bryant and Grim, who
each caught four passes. Grim

had 120 receiving yards and

Bryant had 95.

Barlow led the rushing
attack with 71 yards on 19 car-
ries. Goings had 65 yards on 15
carries.

Walker and McCurley led
the Panthers’ defense. ,

“Those two guys were

incredible,” Harris said. “How A
, about that interception?”
Harris asked the media-

members questions after the
game, at a loss for words on
what some say was his biggest
victory as-the Panthers’ head

7 coach. - ,

“We couldn’t do anything
else but win,” Harris said. “Our
guys would not be denied, and
ourfans would not be deni .”.

The Panthers are 5-5 on the

season and have a slim chance
. of making a postseason bowl

game. They will have to defeat
West Virginia in the season

«ﬁnale on Nov. 27 and hope

Notre Dame loses one of its two

. remaining. games.

“Talk about pressure,”
Harris said. “We had to play in
front of 400 former letterrnen.

“It was a great college foot-

ball game, and I’m glad it went .‘ .

our way.”
