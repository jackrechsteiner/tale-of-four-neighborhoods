Phipps houses more

ERIC LIDJI

Staff Writer

“Luxor,” “Vesuvio” and “Collossus” may
sound like characters on American Gladiators, but
they are actually three of the 69 varieties of
chrysanthemums at Phipps Conservatory’s Fall
Flower Show: Oktoberfest of Flowers.

This year’s fall show is themed after
Oktoberfest, the yearly celebrations in Munich,
Germany, which is highlighted by parades, con-
certs, rides plus lager and bratwurst in epic pro-
portions. The exhibit is predominantly chrysanthe-
mums, with more than 6,000 of the plants on dis-
play.

Chrysanthemums, or mums as they are more
commonly called, are fall ﬂowers that are found
all over the world. The mums in this show are
from the Far East, northern Africa and southern
Europe. .

Miranda Sutton, the Phipps communications
manager, said the mums were chosen because of
their great diversity.

“[Mums] are so varied, from very large [bulbs]
to tiny one’s. Most of them don’t look anything
alike,” Sutton said.

The smaller mums look similar to theidaisy;
both flowers are in the same family.

The show, which is free to Pitt students, begins
in Phipps’ Palm Court, where two l7-foot tall ele-
phant facades dressed in 18th century German
clothing have their arms raised in greeting. The
elephants were donated by nearby Woodland Hills
High School.

"Serpentine Room alone

The exhibit contin- 
ues into the Serpentine 
Room which has been
decorated li_ke an old
Bavarian street, com-
plete with sidewalks and
street signs. The

   

houses more than 1,500‘
mums.

Next is the Sunken
Garden, a long pool sur-
rounded by bouquets of
flowers trained by
Phipps’ botanists to
grow either upward or
downward.

“We are breaking out
of our mold this year,” _ A
Sutton said. “We are  .
going with more yellows    ” .
and brighter colors than  if   
pinks from past years.” V

Botanists have found mums in every color
except blue. The ﬂowers at this show are red, yel-
low, purple and gold.

"The East Room boasts the show’s main attrac-
tion; the model of the glockenspiel. Loosely based‘
on the original glockenspiel located in Munich, it
has 43 bells that chime periodically as 32 figurines
dance on a stage. The performance ends with the
crowing of a golden rooster placed atop the glock-
enspiel. -

The Railroad Garden, brought back from last
year, was added in order to match the rest of the

than 6, 000 Chrysanthemums

O A  gm
show. Now three trains circle a model of the Alps
surrounded by plants.

Included in this year’s Fall Flower Show are

weekend classes and events. They range from
“Home Beer Brewing” to “Dried Weeds Can Be
Attractive.” Also, every Sunday until the end of
the show, local musicians will hold Bavarian
music concerts. ' A

The Fall Flower Show will be displayed until
Nov. 5. For more information, call 622-6914 or

Staff Writer

Kathleen McHugh-Pemu has trou-
ble sleeping. In fact, Monday and
Wednesday nights are the only nights
she doesn’t spend tossing and turning
until morning.

McHugh-Pemu, a Pitt epidemiolo-
gy graduate student, practices yoga
every Monday and Wednesday evening
with instructor Anu Monroe through
Pitt Program Council’s leisure learning
program.

“I am really relaxed when I come
out of class,” McHugh-Pcmu said. “I
really like [Monroe] as a teacher.”

Pitt sophomore Tori Corrandi
McH_ugh-Pemu’s
Monroe.’

“I think she’s a really good instruc-
tor. She focuses attention on each of us
individually,” Corrandi said.

Monroe learned yoga from her
grandfather at age 5 in her native coun-
try, India. At 20, she decided to pursue
a literature degree in the United States.
She was accepted into UCLA,
University of Iowa and Pitt. Monroe
chose to attend Pitt because her
friend’s brother was than living in
Pittsburgh.

She said she has never regretted
her decision.

“I loved [Pittsburgh] from the very
first moment I got here. I love the city.
It’s physically very beautiful, coming
from India,” Monroe said.

According to Monroe, India is a
country where women do not enjoy
much independence. She said coming
to America was a huge change from
what she was used to.

“I could just do anything I wanted.
I thought I’d wandered into some kind
of paradise,” she said.

After receiving her bachelor’s
degree in literature from Pitt, Monroe
decided to pursue her doctorate. She
chose this path because both her par-

cnts were academics in Eastern litera- '

turc, and she always enjoyed reading.

But her pursuit for literature excel-
lence didn’t tum out how she had orig-
inally planned. She came to a road
block along her journey’ which she
called her “grad school crisis.”

While writing her final disserta-
tion, she developed a severe case of
writer’s block. In an effort to free her-
self from the “crisis,” she began prac-
ticing yoga and meditation as therapy.

“Yoga is personally a form of ‘wor-
ship. Through it I connect with a deep-
er part of ‘me and a deeper part of
everything. I feel connected toward a
living source,” Monroe said. She calls
this living source “the mystery.”

Eventually Monroe abandoned
both her dissertation and graduate

View of

school to go on a meditation journey.
For several years she explored alter-
nate practices in health, meditation and
Indian spirituality.

She ‘eventually went back to
school, only this time literature was not
her focus. Monroe studied yoga at the
Himalayan Institute and has been
teaching yoga for 5 1/2 years in places
such as the Jewish Community Center
and a fitness center, both in Squirrel
Hill. Currently she teaches at a
Unitarian Church in Shadyside and for
the Pitt Program Council.

She jumped at the opportunity to
teach for PPC.

“It’s a great opportunity to work
with college students and share yoga
with them,” she said. _

Monroe is not surprised at the
classes’ popularity.

“It’s very effective, based on sound
principles of holistic mind and body
care,” she said.

And Monroe follows these princi-
ples in her instructing. She leaves the
lights off in her classroom on the fifth
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union and
plays very -soothing instrumental

_music. Then she ties her long black

hair into a bun, showing her gold hoop
earrings and pearl necklace.

Her students sit Indian style and
bare foot on towels on the ﬂoor, keep-
ing their backs straight, closing their
eyes, relaxing their hands and breath-
ing deeply. ,

Monroe talks in her soft voice to
help ease her students’ minds.

“Feel your body dissolving away
like salt,’ slowly melting in water. Feel

like you are ﬂoating in the sky and the E

sunset of colors ﬂows through you,”
she instructed.
Monroe helps each of her students

reach the goals of yoga training. She '

explained that physically it strength-
ens, stretches, maintains weight and
eventually leads to weight loss.
Emotionally, yoga is a mind-body con-
nection. It has a relaxing effect that
gives yoga users a sense of deep well-
being. -

“They are able to connect with
their inner core,” Monroe said.

Many of her students said they are
very satisfied with her instruction.

“I never feel she’s not paying
attention to us. Unlike a lot of previous
aerobics instructors I’ve had, she really
cares,” McHugh-Pemu said.

Monroe enjoys watching her stu-
dents as much as they enjoy her
instruction.

“I like watching them grow minute
by minute. It’s a creativevprocess,”
Monroe said. ,

Students interested in registering
for yoga classes for next semester
should contact the PPC in January at
648-7900. A

New endowment fund to

provide books for students

LARA HUFFMAN

Staff Writer

Pitt Program Council is now hr the tele-
marketing business.

The PPC Endowed Book Fund is a
campus—based, grass-roots effort designed
by students to beneﬁt other students. The
fund is being set up to provide ﬁnancial
assistance for students who don’t qualify for
other forms of aid

The endowment marks the ﬁrst time in
the history of fund raising at the University
that students have launched a fund-raising
initiative that directly helps their fellow stu-
dents regardless of their school or college
affiliation.

“Knowing that we, as students, have
created something that will help our class-
mates today, as well as future generations of
Pitt students, is a a great feeling,” said Jen
Ressler, executive board director of the pro-
gram.

In order to be eligible for the grant, stu-
dents will need to‘ be in good academic
standing and apply through the ﬁnancial aid
otﬁce. The grant is designed to help students
afford textbook costs. p

The office is still establishing the exact
criteria and qualiﬁcations for the award

Also, the exact amount of the award is still
being determined

The University’s department of Armual
Giving approached PPC with the idea of ore-
ating the fund PPC then formed a partner-
ship with Pitt TeleFund, the telemarketing
division of the University’s department of
Annual Giving, in order to raise the mini-
mum $10,000 required for an endowment
fund.

As soon as PPC approved the plan,
TeleFund began raising money for the cause.

Since the fund drive began in mid-
August, more than $8,300 has been raised
including contributions from faculty, staff
and parents of current students at the
University.

The PPC book fund is the ﬁrst part of
the what the Oﬂice of Institutional
Advancement hopes will be a much larger
campaign called the Student Fund. The stu-
dents at Te1eF1md may soon get in contact
with other organizations to discuss the possi-
bilities for other campaign opportunities.

“TeleFund [is] primarily handling the.

creation of the Student Fund, that is, a new
fund set up for students to contribute to, any
area of the University that interests them,”

said junior TeleFund employee Megan ‘

Dabkowski. “This idea sort of spun olf of the
idea for the PPC book fund”

DEBATE

the minimum wage?
When asked whether the govern-
ment should support a “substantial”

FROM PAGE 1

increase to the minimum wage,‘

Laboon immediately responded,
“The Libertarians favor repeal of all
minimum wage [legislation].” His
reasoning was that such legislation
interferes with corporations’ ability
to make money.

However, both Republicans and
Democrats favor an immediate $1
increase to the minimum wage.
Socialists also agreed that the mini-
mum wage should be increased
immediately.

Mark Yokim, representing the
Campus Greens, advocated raising
the minimum wage to $7.13 per hour
—— a “living wage” which wouldn’t
interfere with the profits of execu-
tives, Who he said are making “475

times” the average salary of an

entry-level position at their compa-
nies. He also said American laborers
are working 160 more hours per year
because of mandatory overtime.

Should the government allow
same-sex couples to be joined in
civil union ceremonies? '
Supporting their unions, Moreau
said, “This is about how we want to
treat Americans. This is about giving

everyone equal rights.”

-“It’s really not a controversial
topic,” Havens said. He continued
that ‘most Americans are not in favor
of granting homosexuals the right to
civil union ceremonies.

Grey said, “Banning [unions] is
absolutely pure and simple bigotry.”
She added that Pitt should also grant
the same-sex partners of its employ-
ees health care benefits.

Cooley called current laws ban-
ning the unions “complete bu1l.” V

Libertarians agreed too, as
Stacey Steggert said, “The govern-
ment should not be able tomandate
who you want to _marry.”

Should Social Security be priva-
tized?

Representatives next responded
to whether or not citizens should be

allowed to invest their own Social '

Security funds in the stock market,
as opposed to the current federally-
overseen system.

Gross held that the stock market
is not stable enough for people to
trust investing their retirement nest
eggs in, as did the Democrats. Alex
Osgood said that no one knows what
will result after investing such a

huge chunk of money in the stock’

market.
Yokim said that investing the

house. This event took place in a back room
of the cafeteria and included a mass of mon-
sters and strobe lights.

According to Jess Schroth, president of
Sutherland’s RSA, the board had planned for
this event since the beginning of October.

“Food Services was a big help, and the
ladies in the Sutherland cafeteria were really
cooperative,” Schroth said.

Janisak said that the RSA and resident
director John Janisak were both very helpful,
and that Pitt Arts provided movies for the
celebration.

“Monday night, we played ‘The
Shining,’ and on Halloween we played none
other than ‘Halloween,’” she said.

According to Janisak, Oktoberfest also
served to kick off the Lothnop Challenge, a
competition where each residence hall
devises creative fund-raising ideas for a
charity of that hall’s choice. The hall that
raises the most money per resident will win
the challenge.

The challenge began today. V

J anisak said that the RSA board decided
to collect money on behalf of the Make—A—
Wish Foundation.

She said she is excited about the ftmd—
raiser and about all of the RSA board’s plans
for the future.

“Ending one month with an awesome
event and leading right into another is some-
thing the board is proud to bring to our resi-
dents, and Ijust hope they all had a great
time tonight.”

DEBATE

money in the market would only add
to the pockets of the big corpora-
tions who are in charge on Wall
Street, while Steggert said she and
the Libertarians favor the “immedi-
ate privatization” of Social Security.

Korns said that the lowest return
ever given by the stock market is 6
percent, which is still better than the
average 2 percent return most
Americans receive today.

“The people sitting in this room,
under the current administration,
will not get a penny,” he said.

Moreau and Yokim countered
that the average American worker
does not have the time to investigate
his or her options to invest that
Social Security money anyway.

FROM PAGE 6

How does each party stand on

publically—financed‘ campaigns?

Yokim was also a proponent of
publically—financed campaigns.

Laboon disagreed, citing the
Supreme Court’s ruling that contri-
bution money is a form of free
speech and to restrict that money
would be akin to restricting free
speech.

Democrats advocated a ban on
all soft money, as well as full disclo-
sure by lobbyists, detailing how
much money they donate and to
whom. Republicans also favored full
disclosure, but said that “soft

.. money” contributions made by «pri-

vate citizens makevirtually no dif-
ference in campaigns anyway, and to
ban themwould be.senseless.
Giving the Socialist side of the
argument, Grey said, “We don’t even
have a chance,” referring to voters
who aren’t represented by affluent

lobbyists;

“Our voice is so limited,” con-

tinued Cooley, saying that lobbies‘

dictate issue discussion, restricting
many other important topics from
public debate.

Should the government institute
harsher hate-crime laws?

Libertarian Weiner said‘ that by
prosecuting perpetrators of hate
crimes more harshly than other
criminals, the government is exer-
cising a violation of free speech.

Moreau called hate crimes a
“crime against a community,” saying
that free speech did not include mur-
der.

Ed Preston of the College .

Republicans said, “A crime is a
crime, no matter what that crime is,”

advocating the same punishment for‘

convicted perpetrators of. hate

crimes as any other criminals.

Gross also said that hate-crime
legislation is not the best way to
quell hate crimes. Yokim agreed,
saying “an ounce of prevention. is
worth a pound of cure.” ._

Grey said she could not advocate
giving more power to police forces,
because “the police havepproven that
they don’t deserve it.”

Korns_ advocated using the death
penalty in necessary situations,
including punishment of criminals
perpetrating hate crimes.

Roxann Favors of the
Governmental Relations Committee
of the Student Government Board
was glad to see the crowd of approx-
imately l0O, students, and said she
hoped the information would help
students to make informed decisions
when voting on Nov. 7.

“Vote for the candidate that best '

reﬂects your views,” she said.

Asbestos meeting was
inconvenient and uninformative

There is a very special place at Pitt
called the Support Services Oﬂice con-
ference room. This little space is tucked
away below Eddie’s, a largely unchart-
ed part of campus. Chances are, you’ve
never heard of it, muchJless been there.

Thus it seems more than a bit
strange that this room was Pitt’s choice
location for Monday’s meeting about
asbestos abatements in Bruce. Amos
and Brackenridge residence halls.

Asbestos is dangerous stuff, and
we’d like to believe that Pitt cares

‘ enough about its students to ensure that
everyone is given ample opportunity to
learn the truth. Judging by the way that
the University handled Monday’s
meeting, though, it’s difficult to main-
tain conﬁdence in this.

Most likely a result of the inconve-
nient location, only five students
attended the meeting — a disturbing
fact, considering that the number of stu-
dents who live in the Quad is more than
20 times the attendees.

Those students who did attend
may have been confused by the matter
in which information was presented.

For example, in explaining abate-
ment procedures, Pitt health and safety
official Larry Keller stated that after an
abatement is completed, a neutral third
party not connected with the abatement
company tests the area to see if asbestos
has been adequately eliminated.

‘Keller was then questioned‘ about
reports claiming that the owner and
foreman of two companies that have
conducted abatements and asbestos
testing at Pitt are brothers. Keller and
Don Horgan, Allegheny County Health
Department asbestos inspector supervi-
sor, responded that while the owner of
one of the ﬁrms and the foreman of the
other are indeed born of the same par-
ents, the brother at the testing company
no longer works there. Certainly ﬂiis
was a compromise of neutrality to a
considerable degree.

The information delivered at this
underpublicized, inconveniently locat-

ed meeting was clearly less than what_

students need and deserve for a matter
this serious.

Pitt should publish fact sheets,
clearly stating the status of the presence
of asbestos at Pitt, the associated health
risks and the precise removal proce-
dures, and distribute them to all stu-
dents in affected residence halls. Before
each abatement, they should hold heav-
ily—advertised public meetings in more
obvious locations such as the Wﬂharn
Pitt Union or in the residence halls.

Students, in turn, should take a
proactive approach by attending the
meetings and becoming as informed as
possible. It can be hoped that in the
future, the University will make doing

’ so a little less challenging.

I was in the Kentucky Fried Chicken/Taco
Bell/Pizza Hut restaurant ‘the other day to  one
of the new Twister Wrap Chicken thingies from
KFC when, much to my dismay, I discovered that
the menu item in question did not have a combo
meal to go wiﬂi it. I realized there was no need to
panic and decided I could essentially make my
own combo, which is what people did in the old
days before combos. '

My “com ” wasn’to1iginal
at all — it consisted solely of the
sandwich, ﬁies and a drink Now
here came the problem: My serv-
er asked, “Do you want small or
large fries with that.”

Quickly pondering this dilemma (there was a
line’ behind me), I considered that in most fast-
food restaurants the small was stuck in kiddie
meals and not nearly large enough for a strapping

’ young lad like myself. So without much hesita-
tion, I ordered the large.

My eyebrow was raised slightly when I was
charged $6 for the meal, but I rationalized that the
chicken wrap thing was special and thus expen-
sive; also, I didn’t have the usual beneﬁts of sav-

ings that official combos regularly provide. But
then I was quite shocked when my order arrived
andmylargeﬁies wereinaKFCboxnormally
used» for whole combo meals. ~ _

’ Halfof those fries are still sitting in my ‘fridge
in the growing pile of leftovers I’ll throw out
someday. This situation started me pondering a
huge problem I feel is taxing every’ Amen'can’s
mental capacities: No one truly knows what size
is what anymore. v _

I think the problem began with 7—Eleven
(although it is not exactly a fast food distributor)
selling different sizes of fountain drinks.
Someone in the head office had the bright idea to
market an extra-large cup, but instead of calling it
“extra—large” they dubbed it the trendy “Big
Gulp.” Now the idea must have worked well
because, lo and behold, 7—Eleven followed up
with the “Double Gulp,” which was intum fol-
lowed by Wendy’s “Biggie Size,” McDonald’s
“Super Size,” Burger King’s “King Size,” etc. ,

All of these are cute names, but do you see
the problem? Suddenly, there is no standard—bear—

  

There re no sandas ’ in sizing

er to match the name “extra large.” How can any
person be expected to keep track of the fast—food
restaurants’ myriad of catchy names for their
super big drink cups (and fry containers)?
It’s_.gotten to the point where any food work-
er will tell you one of the most popular orders is,
“I’ll have the largest drink you carry, whatever
you call it.” Back» when I was a movie theater

popcorn pusher, I was among the ﬁrst to make

fun of the massesl served.
However, I honestly couldn’t

who just wanted the biggest
but couldn’t for the life of them

fathom what to call that drink size.
This wasn’t exactly my problem with the

ﬁles, but it leads directly to it: Once you start

shifting the names of one size, it’s not so hard to
start shifting the names of all the sizes until the
point where everyone is so totally confused that

they have no idea what they really ordered. How 3

many restaurants have three drink cup sizes, none
of which they call “medium?” . ‘
Why would anyone bother to call their sizes

“small,’.’ “large” and “hungry man” when com- ..

mon sense dictates that in a three size selection
the, smallest drink size, no matter the actual

amount it holds, should be called “small,” the 9

middle size drink should be called “medium” and
the largest drink size should be called “large?”
You know there’s a problem when a compa-
ny has a size called “large” and it’s actually the
smallest size they offer. Something deﬁnitely is
amiss with the standards we hold clear if we’re not

sure whether a “large” fry is really large or puny.

I don’t even know if KFC is to blame for dar-

ing to have a “large” fry that was actually large.‘
Should they" catch up with ﬂie times and make ,

their “large” more consistent with the “larges”
everyone else has come to recognize as “large”
(which is somewhere in the middle of the size
spectrum)?

I’d like to ponder this question further, but I
have some ﬁies to ﬁnish. 9

Justin McClelland knows that size, really does
matter

Vote for good, not the lesser of two evils

A Catholic acquaintance of mine tells

me he often feels like saying confession after A

voting. Given the usual slate of candidates, I
can deﬁnitely see his point — while I do not
say confession, voting certainly gives me a
queasy feeling. That is why I’m
so happy that we have some
superb candidates for once ——
in the presidential race, we
have Ralph Nader, and in the 1

Supporting Nader is easy when you

' look at what the Democrats and Republicans

have to offer us. The Democrats have nomi-

‘ nated Al Gore-, a second—generation career

politician who believes in corporate welfare,

A supports the democracy—undermining World

Trade Organization and NAFTA and who
has, at best, a passing acquaintance with the
thing we call truth. A

The Republicans have nominated
George Bush, a third—generation career
politician who believes in corporate welfare,
also supports the WTO and NAFTA and
who hasn’t shown that he can successfully
run a business, let alone a country. Not to
mention, we kicked out a George Bush just
eight years ago for causing a recession —
why would we want another one?

Both Bush and, Gore back the death
penalty, erroneously claiming it deters

, crime. Both have used drugs. Both are
bankrolled by the same corporations, who   ;
realize they win no matter which one of i

these two win. If the corporations win, we -

deﬁnitely lose. _

Meanwhile, the Greens offer us a real
alternative — Ralph Nader, who has spent
the last 40 years helping the American peo-
ple. He has been at the forefront of the cam-
paign against NAFTA, the WTO, Channel
One and stadium welfare.» He led the ﬁght
for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, safer cars, the CleanAirAct,
the Freedom of Information Act, the Safe

Nader doesn’t lie like Gore, nor does he

instead. He is a millionaire (earning his
money rather than inheriting it or taking
from the public trough), but gives away
most of his income and doesn’t even own a
car. He might not be a religious man, but at
least he doesn’t tarnish religion like Gore
and Bush, who claim biblical values while
routinely violating them. _

Nader prefers the competition of pure
capitalism to the bribes and subsidies of cor-
porate capitalism that Bush and Gore use.

Nader realizes the death penalty has
ﬂaws. Nader thinks democracy is more
valuable than a couple more trade dollars.
About the only ﬂaw I can see is his willing-
ness to sanction abortion and other immoral
 acts, but this is hardly enough

to outweigh his virtues.

Yet some folks claim we
shouldn’t back such a great
candidate. They claim that we
.  i - need pro-choice supreme court
justices, even though a) Bush doesn’t claim
he’ll only pick pro—life justices, b) the
Republicans won’t conﬁrm a liberal justice,
c) it’s dumb to support a candidate that
enjoys infanticide, cl) we should appoint the
best candidates rather than one who agees

   

with us on a single issue and e) the party
aﬂiliation of a president has had little corre-
lation with the ideology of the justices they
select.

San Francisco Examiner colurrmist
Harley Sorensen comments that the ‘lesser
evil’ crowd would have us pick Mussolini
over Hitler when a good candidate was
available. Why must we settle for the lesser
evil whenwe can vote for good?

Others say that by voting for Nader
we’re throwing away our votes. This is just
not true — instead, we’re throwing away our
votes by picking a democracy—ba'shing,
Bible—ignoring second— or third—generation
career politician over a man who has spent
decades making this country, a better place.

In the Senatorial race, we have another A

candidate available for whom we can vote
without saying confession: Ron Klink.
Klink is the rare politician who follows a
moral code. While Republicans back proﬁts
over people and Democrats back infanticide
and ﬁght the Constitution, Klink has been a
staunch backer of labor, the Second
Amendment, is pro-life and works for a
moral economic system. Finally, I can pull
the lever for a major office candidate without
any obvious ﬂaws. Shouldn’t you do the
same? Why settle forevil?

Theﬁrst time he voted for President, Mischa
Gelman threw away his vote by picking Slick
Willie. He has learned his lesson.

Isaac Hawkins returns after missing last season with a knee injury.

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Staff Writer

With preseason All-Big East First Team
selection Ricardo Greer, a healthy Isaac
Hawkins, and a much improved Chris

A Seabrooks leading the way, the Pitt men’s

basketball team’s frontcourt is ready to give
its opposition ﬁts at both the offensive and
defensive ends of the court. 0
“The key to our team is balance,” said
second—year head coach Ben Howland.
Having both Seabrooks and Hawkins

healthy and solid at the center and power I

forward positions, respectively, allows
Greer to ﬁnally play his natural small for-
ward position, which means nothing but
trouble for the competition. ’

“He’s a great rebounder, relentless,”
Howland said of Greer, a 6-foot—5—inch
senior.‘ “He’s good at posting guys of equal
height. He’s a hard rnatchup for the three
men on the oﬂier team. He’s just so strong,
and he’s got a lot of conﬁdence.”

Howland expects Greer’s numbers to
be better, because “he’s going to be on a bet-
terteam.”

Greer will get a lot of help from
Hawkins, Seabrooks and other returning
players as Well as some promising freshmen.

Hawkins, who was named to the All-
Big East team before the beginning of last
season, had to sit out all of last year with a
leg injury.

Hawkins, a 6—foot-8-inch senior, is back
at full strength now and is poised to start hit-
ting jumpers, racldng up rebounds,‘ and
receiving alley—oops again.

“I have no qualms about his health,”

Howland said. “His leg’s been ﬁne.”
With an asthma problem and a hurting

knee last year, Seabrooks is no stranger to J

injury himself, but he comes into this season
looking better than ever with a strong knee
and strong lungs, and should be up with the
Big East leaders in ﬁeld goal percentage
again this year. ‘

“Seabrooks has made strides}?

Howland said. “He’s taking off more on ‘

defense than he did a year ago. He’s doing
a nice job at the offensive end; his jump
hook is really effective right now.”
Sophomore Donatas Zavackas, senior

When the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team takes the court this
season, head coach Traci
Waites will have to be con-
cerned with who is on the court
as well as how they play.

The two probable starting
forwards .are. both nursing
injuries as tip-off approaches
Friday against the Premier All-
Stars in an exhibition.

Sophomore Mandy
Wittenmyer led the team last
season in both scoring and
rebounds,-with 12.1 points and
7.8 rebounds per game. She
saw action in 28 games, starting
27 of them, and played an aver-
age of 29.4 minutes. As a result
of her stellar play, Wittenmyer
was named to the All-Big East

Freshman Team.

However, Wittenmyer had
reconstructive ankle surgery in
April, and it has limited her
practice time. Although Waites
knows it will .,be a factor
throughout the season, she still
has confidence that Wittenmyer
will be a key player on the
team.

“Last year, she led our team.

in scoring and rebounding, and
as of right now, she’ll be a
starter this year, too,” Waites
said.

Wittenmyer acknowledges
that she must step up and take
on a leadership role this season.
She said that overall, the team
is very excited about the sea-
son, and motivated to get to the
Big East tournament and to
record a respectable number of
wins.

“As a team, we’re much

more complete. lt’s a much
more positive, energized atmos-
phere this year,” Wittenmyer
said. “All of us as players, we
have nowhere to go but up.”
Also suffering from injury
is senior Celeste Barkley, who
saw limited action in the 1999-

2000 season because of a per-

sistent knee injury. She aver-
aged 13.1 minutes of action,
with 3.5 ‘points and 2.7
rebounds per game.

Waites noted that during
last season, Barkley never real-
ly got ‘a chance to rest, but this
year, rest will definitely be part

’ of the agenda. More thanlikely,

she will also ﬁnd herself in the
starting lineup.‘ .
The ﬁnal returning forward
is sophomore Dallas Williams,
who last year suffered a torn

MATTHEW SCHLIESMAN
Staff Writer

Traci Waites is a spirited and
vibrant coach that shows her true feel-
ings with full color and emotion at the
exact moment she experiences them.
So when her backcourt for Pitt’s 2001.
'women’s basketball team is men-
tioned, her eyes brighten and an ear-
to-ear grin immediately spreads
across her face.

The third—year coach of the
Panthers has every right to be pleased
at the beginning of this season
because she has a talented bevy of
guards returning, all with NCAA
experience. But she also has some tal-
ented forwards returning as well that
will fit nicely into her rotating guards
and small forwards system.

“One through three don’t make a
bit of difference to me,” Waites said.
“They’re all interchangeable.”

The one or point guard position
will be led by sophomore point guard
Laine Selwyn. She averaged 6.3
points and 2.9 assists a game for the
Panthers last season‘ as a backup to

_Gina Montesano, one of two senior

starters the team lost from last season.
Her speed and excellent court vision
should benefit the Panthers greatly
this season.

“She’s [Selwyn] going to do an
excellent job for us,” Waites said.
“She’s showing all the concepts of a

leader.”

The shooting guard will be senior
Monique Toney. She averaged 10.4
points and 4.3 assists a game while
shooting 35 percent from three-point
range for the Panthers last year, her
first full season as a, starter. As a
sophomore, Toney came off the bench

for the Panthers, sparking vmany
offensive pushes. She is sixth on
Pitt’s a1l—time assist list with 274 and
was named to the Big East/Nike All-
Star tour as a sophomore.

‘Sophomore Brandin Knight in action last season

tures three of those new faces.

The team . lost both Jeremy
Holmes and Jarrett Lockhart to gradu-
ation.

Holmes came off the bench last
season, averaging just five points a
game. Lockhart, a gunner, averaged
close to 12 points a game last season
but was inconsistent throughout his
career at Pitt. He
is currently play-
ing in the
C o n t i n e n t a l
B a s k e t b a l l
Association.

The only
returning guard
from last season is
s o p h o in o r e
Brandin Knight.
Knight, who is the
brother of the
NBA’s Brevin
Knight, started 25
of 28 games last
season as a true
freshman.

K n i g h t

backcourt

learned on the job, as he faced such
Big East foes as Khalid El-Amin,
Erick Barkley and Shaheen Halloway.

In his first season, he averaged
8.5 points per game and led all Big
East freshmen in averaging almost six
assists. He ranked second in the Big
East with close to three steals per
game as well. .

Knight showed plenty of signs
that he could be a star in the Big East.

He scored a career-high 24 points
last season in a game against
Georgetown and accumulated 11
assists in a game against St. John’s.
Without a doubt, Knight is the ﬂoor
general for the Panthers according to
Pitt head coach Ben Howland.

“Brandin is a very unselfish play-
er,” Howland said.

Joining Knight in the backcourt
are Julius Page, Yuri Demetris and
J aron Brown.

Page immediately made himself a
fan favorite at Midnight Madness
when the high-ﬂyer was throwing

    

Howland does
right things at
right times

I’ll just come. right out and say it: I like
what men’s head basketball coach Ben
Howland is doing for Pitt. ‘

I’m not looking at the team’s record in
Howland’s ﬁrst year, or at how he brought
‘back Midnight Madness, or at how he’s
been able to draw some big name recruits to
the program. i

All that stuff is great; that’s what a good
coach is supposed to do. _

. But the best thing Howland’s done for

Pitt has been returning respectability to the _. . i

men’s program, not in its on-court record
(not quite yet), but in its character. A

He’s put his foot down, weeding out
some bad elements and not letting his play-
ers get away with ﬂiings. _

I don’t think too many Pitt fans can dis-
agree with me when I say that when Kellii
Taylor was at his best, he was the most
explosive player on the Pitt team He always
found a way to poke the ball out of the oppo-
sition’s hands, and he could rip down the
court on afastbreakforadunk

But too often Taylor imploded olf the
court, his steals and dunks being overshad-
owed by problems vvith grades and alcohol. ’
And _ when ‘Taylor failed a drug test,
Howland had had enough. _

He cut Taylor around midseason last
year, ending the college career of an athlete

, who had so much potential but could never

quite ‘get control of his problems.

In terms of the team’s standings at the
time, kicking _a game-breaker off a team that
could’ ve used another able, dribbling, steal-.
ing, dunking body was not the smartest
thing to do.

But Taylor was becoming too much of
a distraction and probably should’ve been
gone well before then, and Howland made
the right decision for his team. Either way,
keeping Taylor around wasn’t going ‘to
make the team’s character look any better.

Derrick Worrell was also let go for not
"listening to Howland and for not following
team policy. Howland lost another player,
but he also got rid of some of the negativity
along with him.

ward slots.

After sitting out last year because of ,

NCAA rules regarding transfers, Johnson,
who played two years at the University of
Nebraska before switching to Pitt, is looking
very eager to be back in the game through
his practice habits, Howland said.

“I-Ie’s played really well in practice,”
Howland said. “He gives us good depth.”

Howland also believes the year off

actually allowed Johnson, who graduated

from high school when he was 17, to catch
up with everyone in terms of age.

“['Ihe year off has] been a good thing
for him,” Howland said.

J aron Brown, who redshirted as a fresh-
man last year, also beneﬁted from a year’s
worth of practice experience, and it shows in
comparison to the true ﬁeshmen.

‘‘Just being here and having been
through it for a year deﬁnitely gives them an
advantage over the guys [who are coming
into the program this year],” Howland said

Although the freshmen are having
some trouble adjusting to the system,
Howland said that was to be expected But

- he also expects big things from some of the

newcomers immediately and others a little
further down the line.

Toree Morris, a 6-foot-10-inch, 285-
pound center from Clinton High School in
Oliver_SpIings, Tenn, is a big body, who
will be an immediate defensive presence in
the post. «

“[He’s able to] contest shots, block
shots,” Howland said. “He’s big all the way
around; you’re not moving him off the
block”

Mark McCarroll, _out of Milford
Academy in Connecticut and New York
City’s Christ the King High School, is 6-

foot-10. He is 75 pounds lighter than _

Morris, and Howland said he needs to get
stronger and bulk up some.

“‘McCarroll really needs to get in the
weight room,” Howland said.

Pitt will miss the play of highly—touted
freshman small forward Chevy Troutman
from Wﬂliarnsport High School in
Williamsport, Pa, who will be redshirting
this season. '

While they won’t have Troutman and
his renowned skills at their disposal this
year, the Panthers will have Zelimir “Z”

_ Stevanovic, whose hefty scoring average of

30.3 points per game last season at Florida’s
Gulf Coast Community College led the
National Junior College Athletic
Association.

From the looks of the statistics, Greer
and Hawkins will get a lot of help in terms
of boards and baskets from their ﬁontcourt

mates, and it leaves open the possibility that -

both could make the All-Big East First

. Team at the end of the season.

But Howland is ‘stressing the impor-
tance of the team over the individual. His
players don’t have any problem with that

“It all comes down to your team and the
success you have,” Howland said. “If you
don’t have team success, you won’t get the
individual honors.”

INJURY

anterior cruciate ligament in her knee.
Before the injury, she averaged 13.1
minutes a game with 6.7 points and 4.3
rebounds. She was a steady presence at
the free throw line, hitting 68.1 per-
cent of her shots.

According to Waites, Williams
will not play until sometime in
December, as she is still recovering.
When she does return, she will be
someone who provides depth off the
bench.

“We’ve got to be very careful
about how much we push those people
that are injured, and right now that is a
concern,” Waites said. “If we can limit
their practices, and if we can get 20
minutes out of those guys, then our

FROM PAGE 16.

freshmen can get some backup min-
utes.” »
After transferring from Old
Dominion, junior forward Bettina
Love is ready to play. She played 23
games for the Monarchs in 1998-99,
and contributed two points per game.
The 6—foot-2-inch Love will give
the Panthers more size down low and
help the team capitalize on rebounds.
Leading the incoming freshman class
is Sheila Stufﬂet, who will have an
opportunity to show a lot of backup
time, and is a player that Waites is very

excited about. Jenean Ford is another

newcomer who Waites called “the
most athletic.” Although she has a lot
of things to work on, she will be called
upon to do a lot of rebounding.
Freshman forward Jennifer
Kelleher, who hurt her knee during

practice, will most likely be given a
medical redshirt and miss the season.

The Plymouth, Mass., native led
her high school team in points and
rebounds in both her junior and senior
years. «

For now, the impact of the injuries
is the most pressing issue on every-
one’s mind. Wittenmyer noted that in a
way, it brings the team together
because they are just trying to stay
healthy, pick each other up and learn
from one another. . _

But Waites knows that it is a tough
situation, and that it allows little time
for the freshmen to become familiar
with the program.

“They have to play whether
they’re ready or not,” Waites said.
“They have to because of our
injuries.”

Hopefully, no more cuts will be needed,

Demetris has some size as well
for a guard at 6-foot-4. He will most
likely back up Page.

The final guard is a big one.
Brown, who is 6—foot—4 and 245
pounds, sat out last season, as he was
academically ineligible.

Brown showed some of his attrib-
utes at the Midnight Madness scrim-
mage, as he exhibited his ability to
handle the ball and power his way
into the key. '

Brown, who is from Kentucky,
was chosen as a McDonald’s honor-
able mention All—American as a
senior. He practiced with the team all

last season and knows the offense.
Brown still has four years of eligibili-
ty. V

“Just being around for a year def-

An attribute that the team did not
have last season is depth. Although
Knight, Page, Demetris and Brown

has the option to play swingman

doing a great job," Waites said. “She
has gotten better over the summer and
I’m looking forward to a great, great
year from her. She’ll be a major
impact at the two position.”

The three position is slated to go
to ' sophomore Brooke Stewart, but
Old Dominion transfer Bettina Love
will see ample time at the position.
Stewart averaged 8.2 points a game
and shot 33.3 percent from downtown
last year while Love sat out due to
NCAA transfer rules. , ’

Love’s 6-foot-2-inch height
makes her more apt for small forward
and Stewart’s effortless shooting abil-_
ity makes her a natural for the two
spot. Love is having trouble adjusting
to Waites’ system, so she will split
