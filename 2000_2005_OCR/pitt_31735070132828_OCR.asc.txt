I AMY CHIAVERINI

According to a team of civil engineers,
ﬁve “ways to get over stage ﬁight are naked-
ness,_counting, thinking, looking at an object
and peeing.

As an E—Week event, student represen-
tatives from each engineering department
participated in a humanities homework rally
Thursday morning in Benedum lobby.

The rally was a relay race to complete a
collection of homework assignments taken
from actual School of Arts and Sciences
classes — with a few connect-the—dots puz-
zles and mazes thrown in.

The participants’ had 15 minutes to

complete as many assignments as they

co11ld and were only allowed to write in
crayon.
Christopher Wﬂson, co-chair of E-

" Week, proposed the idea for this new event .

“Not only does the rally provide an
academic, non-engineering event, it’s a sar-
castic attempt to poke fun at the stereotype
that engineers study all the time,” he said.

Teams of four were divided into pairs to
work on each assignment. Each pair had to
ﬁnish an assignment before they could
change places with the other pair.

The competition became ﬁerce, as stu-
dents jumped over chairs to save time when
switching positions. Cheers and frustrated
yells ﬁlled the lobby as the students raced to
ﬁnish assignments from classes in subjects
such as public speaking, economics and for-
eign languages. '

While one of the less”’demanding exer-
cises asked participants to color a picture
with their crayons, a more challenging
assignment came from a Japanese language
class. V t ' A _

Array of food given for free

_ When Zoe Buda and Caitlin" Kelly
heard there would be free food at
Wednesday’s International Food Fair, they
knew where they would be having lunch.

“Free food and college kids — it’s just
a logical combination,” Buda said. -

Declaration
brings message

MARIA NICOLE SMITH
For The Pitt News

I - - v The Declaration of Independence is on

tour again. _

In 1776, horsemen rode from town to
town with copies of the declaration, reciting
its historic words. Since it was considered

- treason to distribute information about inde-

pendence, the horsemen had to deliver a

memorable performance, and then quickly

leave town. .
These days, an original copy of the dec-

laration travels from campus to campus on a‘

tour bus. It is even on display in broad day-
light, and college students are encouraged to
read it freely.

The copy that made it to the Assembly
Room yesterday is one of 25 known copies
of the original 200 printed on July 4, 1776.
Found behind a picture purchased at a ﬂea
market for $4, the document was most
recently purchased by television producer

S-Norman Lear for $8 million. He was so

moved by the words that he created the non-
partisan, nonproﬁt ‘ Declare V Yourself
Campaign.

The Declare Yourself Campaign is a
one—year effort to register young people
between the ages of 18 and 24 and mobilize
them to participate in the 2004 election. The
college tour is visiting 18 campuses across
the country. ‘

“It is an honor that the Declare Yourself
Campaign has chosen to visit our campus,”
said Jocelyn Brown, the program coordina-

> tor of the Pitt Program Council.

The tour not only brought the document
to campus, but it included a live spoken-
word and music show, on—site voter registra-
tion, touch-screen voting booths,‘ and MTV
Road Rulers Susie Barker and Sarah
Greyson. ,

“[Young people] can have a tremen-
dous impact on politics in America,” Road
Ruler. and Pitt alumna Barker said. “It’s a
matter of young people being motivated
enough to realize what they can do.”

Friday, March 26, 2004:

Politicians discuss black Democrats

ROCHELLE HEN’/FGES
Staff Writer

State Rep. Joseph Preston Jr., D-24th
district, still recalls ﬁre hoses being turned
on him when he participated in civil rights
protests during the 1960s.

He still bears marks on his back from
being hit with nightsticks during a protest in
1968, he said Wednesday night in a three-
person panel discussion about black peo-
ple’s involvement in the Democratic Party.

State Rep. Jake Wheatley Jr., D—l9th
district, and Pittsburgh City Councilman
Sala Udin, D-6th district, were the other two
panel members.

Preston said that black voters today
don’t have the sarrre ﬁre to mobilize and
ﬁght for their rights.

“You have something different than
what we had,” he said. “You have freedom.
You have a different level of freedom.”

As a young adult, Preston said, he could
not even go into any restaurant he chose.

“That lack of freedom caused people to
say, ‘Damn it, we want our freedom!”’
Preston said, emphasizing his statement by
pounding his ﬁst on the table.

But that same urgency is not there in
young adults and black people today, he
said.

“I don’t think either [political] party
effectively pursues young people or black
people,” Udin added, offering another rea-
son these groups are not involved in politics.
“They lack any outreach.”

Voter registration is not organized by

political parties, either, he said. Other
groups, like the NAACP, instead organized
registration.

“There’s an active resistance against
us,” Brian Byers, an audience member, said
to the panelists.

Byers said he had tried to become
involved in the Allegheny County
Democratic Committee, but was told he was
too young and inexperienced, and that they
already had enough people.

The Allegheny County Democratic
Committee could not be reached for com-
ment.

Wheatley referred Byers to people
from his ofﬁce, with whom he could talk
about getting involved, but he added that
people should not wait for doors to open for
them.

“Believe that if anything is going to -

happen, it’s going to happen because of
you,” he said. ‘People are not going to read-
ily embrace you.” I 5' ,
“Sometimes you have to bang the
damn door down yourself,” Preston said.
_ The panelists also said that black people
should make politicians more accountable.
“We need to negotiate hard with candi-
dates before the election and hold them
accountable after they’re elected,” Udin
said, in regards to a quote from a politician
who had said, “I don’t want to buy the black
vote, I just want to rent it for a day.” ‘
“That’s how we avoid being bought,”

Udin said, adding, “If we are dumb enough A.

to sell our souls for a couple of dollars, then
weldeserve what we get  don’t think we’re

that d11m .”

But the Republican Party has started to
appeal to more and more black people and
college students, Wheatley said, because too
many college students aspire to become
wealthy — something. that ﬂre Republican
Party emphasizes and beneﬁts from, the
panel members suggested.

Instead, people should be ﬁghting to
make healﬂrcare, food and education acces-
sible to everyone, Wheaﬂey said. ‘

Many black people did not have oppor-

tunities at education when they were young, .

leaving them in poverty and with .low or no
healthcare coverage, Udin said.“ ‘

“[There are] more black millionaires 5

today,” Udin said, “but there are also more
black people in poverty.”
Udin also added that 3 million jobs

have been lost since George W. Bush t

became president. ,

“It’s absolutely necessary to send
George Bush back to Crawford, Texas. Let
his ass be unemployed,” Udin said, which‘
elicited laughs and clapping from the audi-
ence. “He’s an absolute disaster for this
country.” '

Udin noted that he only gets invited to
Pitt every three or four years. If he were
invited more often, he said, he would be
willing to do more panel discussions or
training sessions.

“We come when we’re invited,”
Preston said, adding that both he and
Wheatley had been in Harrisburg earlier on
Wednesday, but they made the trip to visit
Pitt. “You’re important.”

Statistics reach beyond number—crunChing

J. ELIZABETH STROHMP
News Editor

Jessica Utts is looking for proof of the
paranormal.

She doesn't turn to photographs of
ghosts or communications with dead rela-
tives for evidence — she uses statistics.

“Using the standards applied to any
other area of science [that uses statistics], it is
concluded that psychic ﬁmctioning has been
well established,” Utts wrote after serving as
a statistics consultant in a classiﬁed govern-
ment investigation of psychic phenomena.
Utts, a professor in the University of
California at Davis’ department of statistics,
spoke yesterday aﬂemoon in a seminar orga-
nized by Pitfs statistics departments.

“Statistics really can’t tell why” things
happen, in any ﬁeld, Utts said. By perform-
ing a probability test, she can use statistics to
tell her whether the potentially psychic sub-
jects are beating the odds.

In the experiments conducted by the
government, which were declassiﬁed in

1995, hundreds of photographs were divided

, into packets of four dissimilar photos. A

packet was randomly selected by a research
assistant, meaning each packet had an equal
and separate chance of being chosen, and a

single photo from the packet was then select-
ed .

In a separate room, the test subject was
askedtodraw the selectedtarget—inthis
case, the photo that had been selected. In this
way, researchers tested each subject’s clair-
voyance, or ability to receive information

‘ from another place. The subject would
receive no information, except that the target ‘

was a photo.

Since the subject’s drawing could not be
objectively analyzed using statistics, experi-
menters then gave the drawing to a judge.
The judge would receive the original select-
ed packet, including the selected photo-
graph, and choose which photo had been
selected, based on the subject’s drawing.

According to random probability —— if
the subjects’ drawings were of no use to ﬂre
judges, and the judges were randomly select-
ing the target: — the judge would select the
correct photo about 25 percent of the time.
According to the experiments, however,
judges selected the correct photo more often
than random probability would allow.

By comparing the predicted probability
and the actual probability, Utts concluded
that “there was something going on in the

“People are either totally convinced that

it’s real or totally convinced that it’s not real,”

Utts.said, adding that “it’s so easy to lose »

credibility in this ﬁeld” ._

A Utts’ use of statistics in the realm o
extrasensory perception — which is some-
times called psi, to remove the implication of
sensory involvement — illustrates one of
many applications of statistics, according to
Pitt statistics Professor Nancy Pfenning.

“I think there are a lot ofissues in stu-
dents’ lives that can be understood through
statistics,” Pfenning said.

Students can ﬁnd  more ir1ter- '
esting, she said, “if they pay attention to all

the types of problems that can be studied in
statistics, instead of getting -bogged down
with crunching numbers.” ~
’ Pfenning also pointed out that knowl-
edge about statistics can help students under-
stand which studies to trust, and which to
consider with skepticism.
“If you’re too naive, you might believe
everything you read in the paper,” she said.
Addressing Utts’ research, Pfenning
said that the experiment “deserves to be
taken seriously.” _

' A “Statistics is not a black-and~white kind
of subject, the way math is,” she said. “We
can’t expect Jessica Utts to stand up there
and prove [the existence of the paranormal].

what they were expecting. ,

Chuck Jae, a senior, participated on the
computer and electrical engineer team.

“I was expecting things more like basic-
level algebra, but we were playing connect-
the—dots instead,” he said. “It was interest-
ing.” A

Each homework assignment will be
given a score from one to four, based on

effort, completion and accuracy.

“The students are just supposed‘ to put
forth their best effort and make educated
guesses in getting the work done,” Wilson
said. 1

The winning team will be chosen for '

having the overall highest score. _ ' .
Carrnin Sbarro, a junior civil engineer,

I watched the event and commented on it

“This event shows the engineers at our
best,” he said.

Huge crowd comes for free food

Food, page 1

Diversity  Brennan Rhodes explained
the purpose behind the event as attempting
“to get students and faculty to taste and

sample different ethnic foods and to realize

there is diversity on this campus.” - -
Kelly agreed with Rhodes. “We hope
that someone who says ‘I hate Indian food’
will come and if the food’s ﬁee, try it and
realize it is really awesome,” he said.
Many students have had Indian or
Chinese food before, but while both Jimmy
Tsangs and India Garden had tables — they
didn’t serve their most commonly ordered
dishes. Their tables gave students a taste of
various ﬂavors, including Tandoori chicken

and vegetable pakora from India Garden '

and paper-wrapped chicken and Crab
Rangoon from Jimmy Tsangs.

Five other cultures -were represented at
the fair. Ali Baba’s Middle Eastern hum-
mus and stuffed grape leaves attracted

many students, just as Cozumel’s Mexican

cheese quesadillas and chicken taquitos
did. Kazansky’s, a Jewish delicatessen,
gave students the opportunity to sample
corned beef sandwiches and Noodle Kugel.

Most students did not expect to ﬁnd
soul food or Polish food, but SGB covered
all regions. The Bloomﬁeld Bridge Tavern
supplied the fair with traditional Polish
foods, including Halushki and pierogies, a

favorite hometown cuisine. The ﬁnal table
was from Flora’s Catering, a soul food
business. Students were exposed to the

tastes of fried ﬁsh sandwiches, macaroni .

and cheese and greens seasoned with
smoked turkey. 1'

SGB was impressed by the turn out.

‘This is a huge crowd,” Rhodes said.
“It’s an intercultural affair brought together
by food,”

The event wasn’t just about food

though, according to Libby Waldrop, a
member of the Diversity Committee.
“This is about diversity on campus.
There is a lack of minorities, and I wish
more people would get to know other cul-

A tures,” she said. 1 A

The plan worked. Appetites surmoun -
ed racial boundaries as students from dif-
fering ethnicities broke bread together.

Daniel agrees with Wadrop.

“We live in what people commonly
refer to as a global world order,” he said.
“In order to work together effectively, we
need to cross social diﬁerences, religious
diﬁerences, political differences  We are
preparing students for world citizenship,
rather than for Pittsburgh, Allegheny
County, Pennsylvanian or United States cit-
izenship. When I talk about diversity, it’s
not just a buzzword for me. I am hoping a.
week like this willfoster understanding
across cultures.”

believe in the signiﬁcance of their votes.
Another challenge facing young voters is the
feeling that they are uneducated about the
issues and candidates. To alleviate that prob-
lem, the Web site www.declareyourself.com
was created as a resource for those who want
to educate themselves about the candidates
and their platforms. There is also online
voter registration available at the site, along
with information on Voting.

Technology is making an impact on
participation in politics. ‘ The -touch-screen

voting booths, which are not currently used.

in Pennsylvania elections, gave students the
opportunity to practice voting. After choos-

ing a candidate and selecting answers to two
survey questions to determine what matters
most to young voters, a review page appears
on the screen, and the vote is registered. ‘

Alﬂiough the technology is changing, _'

students were reminded thativoting is con-
sistently important when the Declare
Yourself spoken—word artists took the stage.
They said that voters are the “movement
behind the leaders,” while stating that 61
percent of eligible voters do not vote. The
poets then told the audience, “Apathy is

_ unsexy.” Their closing poem compared vot-

ing to any of life’s many necessary acts.
« “Voting is like breathing. You can

_choose not to breathe, butthen you die.”

And “all we got” are these lousy T-shirts

It was a great season, and a close ﬁnish,

6 but once again Pitt was stuck at the Sweet

16. In spite of last night’s loss, the men’s bas-

I ketball team played consistently throughout

the season —— and will only improve next
year. Let’s go Pitt!

But before we become observers of,
rather than participants in, March Madness,

‘ we should reevaluate some of the slogans

Pitt uses, especially “We all we got!’.—’ _

Apparently, we are not the only school
to be all we got. The University of Florida
also is all they got, and  it as a slogan
until they were upset by Manhattan in the
first round of the NCAA tournament. Shirts

were printed, spirit shouted and “We all. we

got!” was their rallying cry. .
And it was ours, too, unfortunately.
This is not to cast any disparagements

on the team. The Pitt men’s basketball team -

is the quintessential Pittsburgh team -
strong defense, team players and a perpetual
underdog status. During the current season,
most of the Panthers’ games have been rivet-
ing, and the team needed something as a bat-
tle cry. . . r

“We all we got!” shouldn’t have been it.
Aside from it being shared with Florida, the
slogan, catchy as it is, makes us look, frankly,
stupid. It’s a spoken expression, from many
songs, but looked, well, silly printed across
the back of T-shirts on national television.

And if we’re a tournament team, we
sho11ldn’t look silly. A ' t~

As a chant, it works. It’s loud, percus-

I sive and hammers the point home —— much

like P-E-N-N S-T Sucks. And the spirit of

~-the phrase is certainly alive in the  and

in Pittsburgh.

Newspapers, are sticklers, for grammar,
and we’re no exception. But objecting to
“We all we got!” is not a mere grammatical
quibble. It’s about ﬂie image the University
projects for itself. Pitt has invested an enor-
mous amount of time and money in making
itself a major research and academic ir1stitu-
tion. Printing ungrarnmatical T-shirt under-
cuts the image of both the University and its
athletes that Pitt worked hard to present

And it perpetuates stereotypes about

athletes. In recent years, much fuss has been .

made about scholar-athletes, especially
UConn player Emeka Okafor, who was
named Big East Scholar-Athlete of the Year
for 2002-03. If Pitt’s athletes are to be taken
seriously as scholars, the slogan should be
dropped from shirts and jerseys next year.
Would we all gather behind “Ymz can’t
beat us” or ‘This needs done?”. These would
only reinforce popular stereotypes about
Pittsburgh, and we wouldn’t scrawl them on

posters or print them on jerseys. Similarly,

“We all we got!” should go.
There’s a serious difference between
written and spoken communication. “We all

~ we got!” is good as a chant, but it doesn’t

translate well to print. We’re going to come

back next year, and hopefully with a better

slogan. Lastly, why improve on the original?
Let’s go Pitt! '

Afterlife has always been one of my
favorite computer games. In the game, you
are given the responsibility of building
Heaven and Hell simultaneously, as the
world you are “derniurge” of begins to
spawn people with souls that eventually die.

It’s SirnCity for the afterlife — instead
of building ‘banks and residences, you build
rewards and punishments. Rewards in
Heaven include a baseball game where
nobody is picked last. Punishrnents include
standing in an amusement park line that
stands still, while the others around you
move quickly. It’s utopia and
dystopia for you to create — or
destroy.

Unfortunately, my utopian
afterlife still doesn’t resemble
my utopia. After all, there’s
nothing in the computer version
about the Cubs winning a World
Series. Moreover, «I have no
chance at becoming some sort
of demigod. On earth, I could,
potentiallyﬁnd myself in a posi-

tion of political powerwhere 

could create my own utopia.

Since I never wish to live through a
Pittsburgh winter again, my utopia would be
somewhere much further south, nearing the
equator. My kingdom has to be in a desert,
Not only does it add mystique, but it also
allows for some great golf courses. Instead

of grass fairways, I would have desert fair- «

ways. Given how I play golf, it’s not uncom-
mon for me to get my ball on the green wiﬂr-
out it touching grass. Hitting the ball in sand
has become a specialty, one so well devel-
oped that may even be ableto beat Tiger
Woods on my utopian desert golf course.
Since it’s my utopia, I would have to be

problem with being a royal leader these days
— the common man wants freedom and

outside of my utopia. Marx got at least one
thing right when he deemed religion the opi-
ate of the masses. Those living under my
rule would experience a puritanical high that
would make Cheech and Chong jealous.
My utopia would also be rich. But soci-

eties, utopian or not, don’t get rich on their '

own. They need something to sell. What bet-

as there will be people stuck in Iowa, oil will
be a needed commodity.

La Roche responds to the Peter Okema Otika pro-
file

In my seven years as head of the media—relations
office for the University of Pittsburgh, I interacted
with The Pitt News on virtually a daily basis. And
while, candidly, I wasn’t always overly happy about
the subjects that were being pursued, I did at least
feel conﬁdent that I would be given a chance to
respond to any charges or statements made about the
University and that those responses would be fairly
represented in the ensuing articles.

It was with some surprise and disappointment,
then, that I discovered upon reading the article about
Peter Okema Otika that The Pitt News had apparent-
ly abandoned the tenet of journalistic fairness when it
decided to publish Okema’s exaggerated and mis-
leading allegations about La Roche College, without
even making any attempt to verify those allegations
or to get a response to them;

Okema was admitted to La Roche College in
1999 on a scholarship provided by the Pacem In
Terris Institute. Founded in 1993, the Institute brings
to the La Roche College campus selected groups of
promising, college-age women and men from con-
ﬂict, post-conﬂict and developing regions of the
world. The scholarships they receive cover tuition,
room and board, books, medical insurance and a
small monthly stipend.

In return, the students agree that, upon comple-

tion of their studies, they will return to their home-
lands and use the education they have received to
contribute to the peaceful development of their coun-
tries of origin. Okema was aware of and agreed to
this commitment prior to accepting the scholarship,
and at no time during his two years at La Roche did
he ever express any concern about returning to
Uganda.

Since 1993, almost 400 persons have participat-
ed in the program, the vast majority from Africa.

To date, more than 150 have graduated and 225

are still enrolled. Over the history of the program,

only 10 have been dismissed prior to graduation,
most of those for academic deﬁciencies.

Okema’s scholarship was revoked and he was
expelled from the college for having a live-in girl-
friend in college housing ——_- a clear violation of col-
lege rules — which Okema himself acknowledged in
writing after it came to the college’s attention fol-
lowing the issuance of a warrant for his arrest by

Ross Township police on charges of indecent assault‘

and attempted rape. . ‘ .

Even though there was no requirement to do so,
La Roche bought Okema a ticket to return to Uganda,
following his expulsion, because there was no evi-
dence that he had sufﬁcient fimds to acquire a ticket
on his own.

At no time was Okema forcefully taken any-
where by La Roche College personnel.

Two security officers in plain clothes provided

 

Okema with transportation to the airport. On the day
he left, he had a conversation with the president of
the college. At no time during that conversation did
he request any appeal of his expulsion, nor did he
express any concerns about returning home.

In fact, he requested the president’s assistance in
gaining admittance to the national university of
Uganda upon his return. No one was more surprised

‘V than our security personnel when he decided at the

last minute that he was being “kidnapped.”

As far as his lawsuit against the college goes, that.

too is without validity.

La Roche College has assisted any number of our
international students who have experienced prob-
lems ranging from potential deportation because of
visa irregularities to difﬁcultie§,,:re;t1irning to..the col-

lege followingvisits home.

Peter Okema had a wonderful oppdrtunity to
study in this country on a full scholarship. . r , I _

_ It is a shame that he lost that opportunity through

his own actions. It is a greater shame that he is now
trying to place the blame for his trouble on others. i

And it is perhapsthe greatest shame tha,_t_The;Pitt.  ‘
News saw ﬁt to print his..’r-jnisleading exaggerations ‘

without any attempt: atveriﬁcation.

“George” not crying wolf: an allegory in oneact, with sheep   

George stood over the dead body of
the sheep. The sheep at his feet was one
of the 200 sheep that died that day.
George’s body felt cold and weary.

George turned to the sheep that had
survived the wolf attack and shouted,
“How many of us are left?” There were
only 30 sheep still alive.

“George, what will we do? Who did
this?” the remaining sheep asked him.

“I will determine who did this and
decide what is best. I will have an answer
at sunrise tomorrow,” George said.
George turned and walked slowly off into
the ﬁeld by himself.

The next day at sunrise, all the sheep
gathered around the large rock where
George would speak. A hush fell over the
sheep when George climbed atop the rock
and raised his head. i

“I know who did this,” George bel-
lowed. “It was the same man who killed
my father. It was the farmer!” The
group’s eyes widened and they began to
talk among “themselves. George contin-
ued: “We must rid our world of this evil
threat to us and to all the animals of the
farm. We must ﬁnd the farmer and kill
him.” The sheep’s conversations grew
louder, so loud that George had to ask the
group to quiet down before he could con-
tinue.

Silence came, but one of the sheep
near the back of the crowd shouted, “This

wasn’t the work of the farmer. This was
the work of a pack of wolves!” George
quickly replied, “Yes, you are correct.
The farmer is in league with the wolves to
wipe all of us animals out. The farmer is
evil and conspires with all those who are
evil as well.” This sent the sheep into

frenzy. . it is our duty to protect our-
“Kill the farmer!” th selves and all the other ani-‘

group shouted. ' mals of the farm by destroy-
In the following months, ing the threat of the farmer!”

George organized all the
sheep into an army, despite
the fact that some sheep did- .
n’t wantto join. First, he had
them locate the ,farmer’s
house. Now, he ‘was creating
a plan to kill the farmer. He
would ﬁnally be able to
avenge his father’s death.
Unfortunately for George,
more and more of the sheep were starting
to doubt whether the farmer had anything
to do with the attack. After rumors started
to spread, .some sheep questioned
George’s ideas, and dissent was growing
in the ranks. George decided to give
another speech. .

“Fellow sheep, I know some of you
have doubts about whether the farmer
was to blame in the vicious attack on us
sheep. Let me assure you, it was the
farmer who attacked us. I heard him con-
spire with the wolves. I’ve seen him buy-

ing more guns and he is readying to attack

us again! We must kill the farmer before’

he can kill any more of us. The farmer is
a vicious man. Have you seen the way he
treats his own family? He beats his wife
and takes his belt to his children’s backs.
The farmer is a cruel and vicious man and

‘That night, the sheep
killed the farmer. In the days
that passed, some of the
sheep had to stay‘ at the
farmer’s house and care for

' his family. Without the
farmer, the house was in dis-
array. Back at the ﬁeld,

George was back on top of

the large rock, speaking
again to the sheep.

. “Fellow sheep, the threat of the
farmer has passed. But we still must care
for his family because we have a respon-
sibility to help all creatures of the farm. I
am sending 10 more sheep to the house
this afternoon toaid in the family’s recov

ery. '

The sheep who remained in the ﬁeld ,

were unsettled by George’s plans. “You
are sending too many sheep to care for the
family. There is no one left to guard us if
the wolves should retum,” one of the

sheep said. The other sheep agreed with

Z “The wolves are not a major threat to
us. Once the farmer was destroyed, our
only major threatlwas destroyed. I will
take care of the wolves myself. Don’t
worry about them. Go and care for the
farmer’s family,” George commanded.
And the 10 sheep went, leaving only 10
remaining in the ﬁeld.

That night, while the sheep in the
ﬁeld slept and the sheep in the farmer’s
house cared for his family, the wolves
returned. The sheep in the ﬁeld were
awakened by screams of agony from the
sheep around them, as the wolves tore
into their ﬂesh. As the pack of wolves
devoured the sheep in the ﬁeld, the sheep
from the house saw what was happening
and hurried back to the ﬁeld to attack the

wolves. The sheep from the house were »
disorganized and came at the wolves in

packs of 10, the ﬁrst 10 having leftthe
house faster thanthe second 10. As each
group arrived, the wolves gobbled them
up until all the sheep had been eaten. The
wolves licked their lips hungrily and
grinned evil grins. “Foolish sheep,” they
said. The wolves moved over .the ﬁeld.
The cows were next.

COURTESY BURNINGEYE. COM.AU

The Icarus Line joins The Distillers at Club Laga on Sunday.

There are very few shows left to be played
Club Laga. Most people will be griping that they
wanted to see The Darkness there. Or Saves the
Day. Or Death Cab for Cutie. Well folks, there’s
one amazing show coming to town that nearly
slipped under everyone’s radar, including my
own. This show features The Distillers, The Lot
Six and one of my personal favorites, The Icarus
Line. I g

The Distillers features the lovely Brody
Dalle, who was quite the topic of discussion dur-
ing the past year or so. She was married to Tim
Armstrong, and is thus known around the punk
community as Brody Armstrong. However, the
two had a messy falling out, and as of late, Brody
has been spotted with Nick Oliveri, formerly of
Queens of the Stone Age.

But enough about her love life; can she rock?
A resounding “Hell yes!” as her looks are just as
appealing as her vocal bite. The Distillers have
been playing for a number of years, and they
show no signs of slowing down.

While Coral Fang received many good
reviews, their big hit was 2002’s Sing Sing Death

House. A brutally honest record
about how Brody’s life went
from disastrous to wonderful, it
shows the true depth of the
band. A

The reason that many of
you should be there, however,
is The Icarus Line. Besides
containing a member of the
Web zine Buddyhead, this band
will rock your face off. When
asked to describe the vocal
' - stylings of Joe Cardamone, I
tell others that he sounds like
Dave Grohl on the seminal Foo
Fighters hit, “Enough Space.”
Imagine Grohl screaming as he
does on that song, only all over
the place and with even more
intensity. That’s The Icarus
Line. The band rocks, doesn’t
give you any BS,‘ and is full of
energy and intensity.

There have been stories
about how the band played a
show at The House of Blues
out in California, and Aaron
“Icarus” North, who was also a
writer at Buddyhead, broke a
glass case containing Steve
Vai’s guitar. He then proceeded
to plug it in and jam. The band
was immediately ejected from
the club. They’ve apparently
also been banned from other
clubs in America. These guys
truly know What it means to
rock the hell out. Not only that,
but they
, have also
been found defaming The
Strokes’ tour bus by spray-
painting a large penis on it.

Can you get any more
rock ‘n’ roll?

The Lot Six will also be
on the bill, bringing a retro
indie-rock-with-a—punk—
hybrid sound, which is also
quite underrated. There’s
nothing more that should
stop you from going to a
show that should be selling
out in every city.

The Distillers, The Icarus
Line and The Lost Six will
play Club Laga on Sunday.
Doors open at 6 p.m. and
tickets are $12. Go for a
night of great rock, with no
strings attached.

-Adam Rauﬁ staﬁ‘ writer

More than a
few punkers

The sound of the Boston—based band The Lot Six
has been likened to “ a three—way death match
between The Beatles, the Jesus Lizard and the Pixies”
by Alternative Press magazine. This March, the publi-
cation has also listed the band in the “100 Bands You
Need to Know in 2004.” That’s a pretty big accom-
plishment for the five members, who didn’t release any
music until 2002 with the companion albums Gwylo
and Animals. ,.

According to the San Francisco Examiner, The Lot
Six is “unlike the scores of. affected indie rockers mak-
ing the rounds...” This might be because of the band’s
method of piecing together different types of genres
within its music.

Since 1999, the band’s frantic punk energy, cou-
pled with a honky—tonk country ﬂavor, has garnered
fans from New York to the South. Their signature
sound is most apparent in their recent album, the 2003-
released Major Fables.

The 10 tracks range from fast punk-scream fests
like “Autobrats” and “Out of Control” to “My Baby’s
Gone,” a ballad that sounds like something out of a
Willie Nelson songbook. The album even features
tracks that play with a slow reggae guitar —— “Go to
Sleep” —— and the harsh, walkie—talkie vocals reminis-
cent of The Strokes — “X-Rayted.”

As of this spring, The Lot Six embarks on a nationwide
tour. On March 28, the band will hit Pittsburgh, play-
ing some of its high-energy music at Club Laga. For
more information, call (412) 687-4636.

Magick Fire Music & Wow
JOMF

Touch and Go Records
scam/2 _ 4
Recommended if you like“;
Godspeed You Black '
Emperor!

When I first read this band’s
name, I wasn’t sure what to expect.
Actually, I didn’t even have: any
press on it. I thought, “Is this band
hip-hop? Nu—metal? What could it
be?” JOMF ended up not being any
of these. The last thing I expected
was a band reminiscent of Godspeed
You Black Emperor! But that’s what
it was. In fact, JOMF even toured
with them.

The album features guitars,
vocals, turntables, reeds and more. In
a live setting, the band uses video as
well, which is “played” by one of the
instrumentalists. As I sat down to let
the double album Magick Fire Music
& Wow LPs fully soak in, I was not at
all prepared for the journey. JOMF is
a little bit more accessible than
Godspeed at times, with some
melodies that develop quickly. Most
Godspeed songs involve long exposi-
tions, where you might be waiting up

until the eighth minute of a song to
get the main riff going. JOMF has
long songs, but the melodies don’t
try to stay hidden from you at the
start. This can be a good or bad
thing, depending on your mood.

While I'm used to acts that make
long songs, such as Godspeed, A
Silver Mt. Zion, Fly Pan,Am, Set
Fire to Flames, Sigur Ros, I was lis-
tening to the songs, waiting for
intensity to build up. Halfway
through disc one of JOMF’s release,
I was noticed that the band used sax-
ophones and what sounded like field
recordings in order to make the
music get weird.

J OMF would be so much better if
they allowed songs to develop
instead of just blowing their wad in
the first few minutes and then just
going to the weird to close out songs.
If they would spend some time really
getting that intense buildup, and then
going weird on top of it, this would
be one hell of a band.

There were a few songs that did
this well, though, such as “Jugband
2000” and “Quaker” on disc one, and
“Black Squirrels” and “Wow” on
disc two. Actually, to tell you the
truth, the two discs are like Jekyll
and Hyde. CD No. l spends more
time on the weird across seven

J OMF, a band name you can’t say to your mother

tracks, whereas the second excursion
is only three tracks. The latter disc
allows the band to further develop
the material, which makesit so much
better and easier to consume.
However, you’re looking at the first
two tracks clocking in at a massive
33 minutes combined, while the last
track clocks in just past the 17 mark.
The reason for this disparity is that

the double disc is a" reissue of two
out-of—production vinyls that were
manufactured one year apart. This

can explain the odd transformation, T

but if I had to rank these two discs in
order of preference, I’d give disc two
a spin first. It will probably prove to
be a more enjoyable experience, with
disc one being a good follow—up.

WPT S presents night of in—your-face indie—rock bands

With a powerful and interesting
approach to making music, Mates of
State makes some pretty impressive
music. Fortunately, you get the
chance to experience it in person
tonight at 8 p.m. The band will be
heading the WPTS—sponsored show
at the Public Health Auditorium.

After years of playing in count-
less different bands, Kori Gardner
and Jason Hammel hooked up at the
University of Kansas in 1997. After
their meeting, they decided to ditch
the guitars that they wielded in pre-
vious bands to take a new approach
with their music.

They left Kansas for California,
where Gardner learned to play a
big-ass organ and Hammel worked
on his skills behind a drum set. The
result was beautiful music and the
formation of a band. Now the two
have three full—length albums.

Not only do they work together
making music, but they also coexist
as a married couple. But unlike the
White Stripes, they don’t deny that
they are married. They sing about

their love, making it especiallyi

clear in their song “Gotta Get a
Problem.”

Leaving guitars out of the pic-
ture, they work on using their
vocals as another powerful instru-
ment. They both share vocal duties,
singing over top of one another and
taking turns with verses. It brings
the music to an entirely different
level; it’s a beautiful change of pace
from the typical mold of making

music.
Mates of
State has been

touring recently
with Death Cab
for Cutie, helping
to get the word
out about them-
selves a little
more. They will
then go on to
open some shows
for The Strokes,

show that comes

Panthers lassoed by Cowboy

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The
Oklahoma State Cowboys advanced to
the Elite Eight round of the NCAA
Tournament, while sending the Pitt
men’s basketball team home from the
Sweet 16 for the third year in a row.

“I’m upset. I had a good career,
but never made it passed the Sweet
16,” Pitt guard Julius Page said. “It’s
going to stick with me for a while.”

After trailing at halftime, 28-26,
the Cowboys (30-3) found themselves
tied with the Panthers with 7:53 left in
the game. With the score knotted at 42,
Oklahoma State went on a 21-9 run to
propel itself to a 63-51 victory over
the Panthers last night at Continental
Airlines Arena.

Pitt (31-5) out—rebounded
Oklahoma State 20-15, in the first
half, and scored 10 second—chance
points as compared to the Cowboys
eight.

The second half was a different
story, as Oklahoma State out—rebound-
ed the Panthers, 15-13, and limited
them to just four second—chance
points. _

“I thought in the first half they just
beat us to death on the glass,’’
Oklahoma State head coach Eddie
Sutton said. “I think in order for
Pittsburgh to win they have to get sec-
ond shots.”

Oklahoma guard Tony Allen was
responsible for 13 points in the game’s
final seven minutes. Allen finished
with 23 points and seven rebounds.

“I just took what the defense gave
me,” Allen said. “I felt like if coach

[Sutton] called my number, I’d come
through.”

Oklahoma State forward Joey
Graham, who scored nine points,
began the Cowboys’ run with a layup.
That was followed by another basket
in the paint from Allen off a Chevon
Troutman turnover that put them ahead
46-42. Troutman followed with a

layup to cut the Panther deficit to two-

Graham scored another bucket for
the Cowboys, which made the score
48-44. On Pitt’s next possession,
Panther guard Carl Krauser, Pitt’s
leading scorer with 15 points, stood at
the foul line and missed both his free
throws.

After Krauser’s missed foul shots,
Oklahoma State was able to put some
distance between itself and the
Panthers. Graham nailed a jumpshot to

put the Cowboys ahead‘ by six, but
Panther ‘forward Jaron Brown hit a
three-pointer to cut Oklahoma State’s
lead to 50-47.

Allen responded at the other end,
knocking down a three-pointer with
Brown in his face. Brown spent most
of the first half on the bench in foul
trouble. He did not start the second

half, because he picked up three fouls

in the first half.

“It was very frustrating,” Brown
said. “When I picked up two fouls, it
really frustrated me, [but] I tried to
keep motivating my team.”

After a steal by Allen, which was
converted into a basket by Janavor
Weatherspoon, Allen, again, connected
on a shot from beyond the are that put
the Cowboys ahead at 57-47.

“[In] the second half, because we
took control of the boards a little bet-
ter, we were able to run,” Sutton said.

The Cowboys finished off the

Panthers with a jumper from guard
John Lucas, which was followed by a
basket by Troutman. Allen was inten-
tionally fouled, but knocked down
both shots from the charity stripe.
Brown followed. Allen’s free throws
witha layup. Oklahoma State forward
Ivan McSar1in capped the 21-9 run
with a dunk.

“In the second half, they got a lot
of layups when we were trying to
overextend,” Pitt head coach Jamie
Dixon said. “We gave them some
layups that we normally would not
[and] we were a step late on a couple
of things.”

Pitt began the game trailing 7-2, as
Allen scored four of the first seven
points. I

Tale of two

halves for

the Panthers

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor .

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ.) —
Through one half of Thursday night’s

‘game, Pitt had the Oklahoma State

Cowboys right‘ where it Wanted them.
The Panthers he1d_a 28-26 lead at
the half while holding Oklahoma
State’s offense to just 30 percent shoot-
ing from the ﬁeld. On the other end,
Pitt was shooting 37 percent '— a blis-
tering number considering the

Panthers’ offensive woes heading into-

the game. ~

Against an offense that averaged
78.3 points per game and had won its
first two NCAA Tournament games by
a combined 36 points, Pitt looked like it
would force the Cowboys to play its
style of basketball.

For the first 20 minutes, Pitt held
Oklahoma States’ transition game to
zero points and had its way inside,

‘outscoring the Cowboys 18-10 in the

paint and out-rebounding them by five.

But there was still another 20 Inin— I

utes to go.

“I thought their defense was out-
standing,” Oklahoma State head coach
Eddie Sutton said. “We’re a lot better
basketball team when we can get the

ball and run with it. We got some bas-

kets there.”

Oklahoma State solved the mystery _

that had been Pitt’s defense, connecting
on 64' percent of its ﬁeld goals in the
second half and knocking out the
Panthers, 63-51. The Cowboys
bounced back on the boards, grabbing a
15-13 advantage in rebounds to go
along with outscoring Pitt in the paint,
22-14, and picking up 11 points in tran-
sition.

“We definitely had them where we
wanted them,” said Pitt point guard
Carl Krauser. “It’s crazy. We felt com-
fortable in the first half, holding them
to that low of a percentage [in shoot-
ing].” -

The loss was Pitt’s third consecu-
tive in the Sweet 16 and, after losing
four games by a combined 10 points
this year, it was the Panthers worst loss
of the season.

Lower seeds should not receive home court advantage

L SPO  VIEW

  

And you thought higher-seeded Pitt had it bad last
weekend, ‘having to play against Wisconsin, in

4 Wisconsin.

In the women’s NCAA Tournament that started
last weekend, there were numerous unfair home court
advantages handed out to lower seeds..

For the first time in a long time, the Connecticut .

Huskies were not a No. 1 seed in the tournament,
because of a loss in the Big East serni-ﬁnals and _a few

* bad losses down the stretch. Instead, Penn State was

given the nod for its terriﬁc season. .

So what was Penn State’s reward for receiving the

No.’ 1 seed? It was a trip to Blacksburg, VA,‘ to play
‘Virginia Tech in the Hokies’ home arena. The Hokies
were given a No. 8 seed, yet they somehow received
home-court advantage. Just like Pitt, ‘Penn State over-
came this hurdle and cruised into the Sweet 16 a few
nights ago. You’d think that Penn State would surely

have it easier on their road to the Final Four now, _

right?

Wrong. _

Penn State’s reward for winning on its opponent’s
court in the round of 32 is a trip to Hartford, Conn.,
where UConn is the No. 2 seed in the Lady Lions’
bracket. Barring a monster upset the size of Joe
Patemo’s ego, Penn State will have to play the
Huskies at UConn. Even though we saw Duke upset

UConn in Hartford earlier this year, don’t expect Penn -

State to be in the Final Four with this roadblock in its
way. ' A

But Penn State Wasn’t the only school that got
screwed No; 2 seed Kansas St. is in a stateof denial

this weektafterlosing to No. 7‘ seed Minnesota in‘=the ’

round, of 32. They_laren’t in denial because they lost.
Rather, they are in denial because the loss came on the
Gophers’ home court in Minnesota. Meanwhile, No. 6
seed Ohio State got home court advantage,,but No. 3
seed BostonvColle'g’e prevailed and advanced to the
Sweet 16. ‘

So now I’ve told you about a No. 6,'N_o.._7 and a

= No. 8 seedreceiving home court advantageini the ﬁrst

round, butit gets even better.

For some reason, not known to man or woman in
this case, No. 11 seeded California-Santa Barbara
received home court advantage in the first two rounds.
And, would you believe‘. it, the Banana Slugs — yes,
that’s their mascot — after pulling an upset in round
one, moved on to upset No. 3 seed Houston to
advance to. the Sweet 16 as No. 11.

But wait, I’ve got one more involving the site for
the Sweet 16. The Midwest bracket’s site is in
Norman, Okla., home of the Oklahoma Sooners. The
Sooners, a No. 3 seed in the tournament, would-
receive home court advantage in the Sweet 16. But
that’s not the shocking part. What is shocking is that
the No. 1 seed in this bracket is Tennessee. The
Volunteers got dissed by the tournament committee.

Why is this shocking?

For years, it has been Tennessee vs. UConn to see
who is the best in women’s basketball. You’d think
Pat Summit and the rest of the Volunteer nation
deserve a little more respect than to be put in a situa-
tion like this one.

Luckily for Tennessee, however, the No. 6 seed
Stanford took out Oklahoma in the round of 32 before
the Sooners could even get to their home court.

Here’s a little message to the NCAA women’s .
Tournament Committee: Your sport is growing in ’

interest andthe competition is beginning to even out.
Try some neutral sites for next year’s tournament. No
one wants to watch a home team win, it’s just not
exciting.

- As for Penn State, sorry, you’ll have to wait until
next year. ‘

Friday, March’26,=2o0h r

 

Hold off on the bobble—head dolls.
Forget about the free dufﬂe bags. There
is something else dragging Pittsburgh
Penguin fans to Mellon Arena nowa-
days — a good hockey team.

Since their National Hockey
League record of 18 straight losses,
which included an overtime loss, the
Penguins have circled the Zamboni and
posted a record of 10-3-2-0. They are,
by far, the hottest team in the NHL,

' with the Stanley Cup Playoffs just

around the bend.

But they are not playing for a better
playoff position or for a division title
this year. The Penguins are just trying to
migrate away from the South Pole of
the NHL standings.

They’ve been in dead last for a
while now, but after their recent suc-

 

cess, the Penguins find themselves
three points away from stepping ahead
of the deteriorating Washington
Capitals. ‘

This excites many Penguin fans,
but at the same time poses the question:
why win now?

The Penguins had, the best chance at
getting the No. 1 pick in the 2004 draft
solidiﬁed months ago, but then they
started winning. If they overtake the
Capitals for second-to-last. place, the
Penguins will only have a 18.8 percent

chance at receiving the No. 1 —,

because of the lottery system the NHL
uses — as opposed to the 25 percent
chance they could hold if their status in
the standing was to remain the same.‘
By winning, the Penguins could
miss out on the player deemed to be the

‘best available in the 2004 draft, forward

Alexander Ovechkin. The 18-year-old
Russian, who now plays for Moscow’s
Red Army team, is said to have the
potential to become a better player than
At1anta’s Ilya Kovalchuk.

Ovechkin is described as a fran-
chise player by scouts. And if the
Penguins were able to acquire this
prospect, they would have drafted two

“franchise” players in the past two
years —— the other being their 2003 first-
round draft pick goaltender Marc-
Andre Fleury.

The last franchise player the
Penguins drafted, Mario Lemieux, led
them to two 1 Stanley Cup
Championships.

Imagine what two new, high-caliber
players could do for the Penguins with
the elder franchise player suiting up for
another NHL season. [

Barring a lockout, these three play-
ers could combine, with the current
team of rising stars, like Ryan Malone
and Ric J ackman, to form a playoff con-
tender next year.

And that is what’s at stake if the
Penguins keep winning. ' '

So why don’t the Penguins just
lose? V ‘ 1

Because the team has heart and
their new first-year head coach Eddie
Olczyk will not give up so easily. This
is why the Penguins took to the ice,
sporting a 20-45-7-4 record and blew

away the Rangers 5-2 on Tuesday night. I

This is why they will play hard until the
ﬁnal horn sounds tonight and tomorrow
night in their home-and-home series

  No. 1 draft pick in jeopardy if the Penguins keep winning

with the Buffalo Sabres.

The Penguins are filled with youth;
_ and they are all ﬁnally coming together

and looking like an NHL hockey team.

Led by first—year player Malone,
who has had a stellar rookie season with
22 goals and 20 assists, the Penguins
now have a power play that has been
ranked among the best in the NHL since
mid—January.

However, if the.Penguins continue
to win games and in turn, lose the No. 1
pick in the draft, they could still luck
out come draft time because there is
another Russian making noise in the
2004 draft. He is Evgeni Malkin, and
European scouts have described him as
a_ scary power forward, who works
extremely hard — just like Olczyk’s
crew does right now.

And with five games remaining for
the Penguins, there is only -one certain-
ty. The Penguins will not go down qui-
etly.

Jimmy Johnson is a staﬂ writer for The
Pitt News, and if the Penguins keep
winning, he is, positive that he will be
the second overall pick in the 2004
draft. 8

Sweet 16 loss, page 12

defensive stands by both teams,

Pitt center Chris Taft cut the .

Cowboy lead to 7-4 by putting the
ball back in off of a missed three-
point attempt by Krauser. Krauser
made the score 7-6 with a basket,
but he fouled Weatherspoon on
Oklahoma State’s next posses-
sion. Weatherspoon connected on
both of his foul shots.

The score remained close
with a couple of drives in the
paint by Krauser that resulted in
layups.

With the score tied at 13,
Krauser gave the Panthers their
first lead of the night at 15-13,
with two converted shots from the
free-throw line.

Both teams ended the first
half scoring 13 points apiece and
made the score 28-26 in Pitt’s
favor.

“We thought we had them
right where we wanted them,”
Krauser said. “We out-rebounded
them and we were shooting well.”

Krauser believes Pitt needs to improve its shooting for next year

First half, page 12

After trailing by three with 13:23 to
go, Oklahoma State scored the next nine
points to swing momentum in its direc-
tion and go up 42-36. Pitt battled back
and looked like it regained momentum
after a three-pointer by J aron Brown cut
the lead to three.

But on the Cowboys’ next trip down
the ﬂoor, Chevon Troutman grabbed a
defensive rebound and appeared to call a
timeout while crashing to the ﬂoor. The
officials signaled a traveling violation
instead, and Oklahoma State kept posses-
sion of the ball.

Seconds later, Tony Allen, who_

shredded Pitt’s defense for 23 points,
nailed a three from the comer to put the
Cowboys back up by six with 4:02
remaining. . .

“That was a really bad possession for
us,” said Krauser. “Chevy got a great
rebound and got pulled tothe ﬂoor. It’s
rough to get a change like that. You’re
doing so well and you get stabbed in the
back. You just have to bounce back from
it.”

Pitt was unable to comeback, con-
necting on just two—of-eight shots down
the stretch and all Oklahoma State had to
do from there was run out the clock.

“It was very frustrating because I
know it’s my last game to probably play
and we got beat,” Brown said about the

scoring quickly was something that Pitt
needed to improve on for next year. i
“We need to work on our perimeter
