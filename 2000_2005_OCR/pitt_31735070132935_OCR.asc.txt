Oakland saw a rise in violent
crime from 2002 to 2003, with" a
particularly large increase in South
Oakland. - ,

Tim Delaney, chief of Pitt’s
police department, said that the pop-
ulation of student residents is rising
in South Oakland — which, in the
department’s reckoning, is the part
of the region south of Forbes
Avenue — and that this is one possi-
ble reason for the rising crime rate.

“The nature of students is that
they are concentrating on their stud-
ies and parties and aren’t concen-
trating on the shady individual
standing around who looks like he
isn’t doing ‘anything productive,”
Delaney said. .

He said that the area’s burgeon-
ing‘. bar scene also draws in more
people from throughout the city,
thus causing more crimes.

“Things go in cycles in the city,”
he said. —

“A few years ago, it was really
quiet in Oakland, when all the activ-
ity was in the Strip District or
Station Square.” 9 _

Amnesty
International

AMY CHIAVERINI
Staff Writer

A small group of Pitt students are
trying to change the world, one letter
at a time.

Composing political letters of
conscience to various governments at
weekly meetings is just one way that
Pitt’s chapter of Amnesty Intemational
works to prevent and end abuses of
human rights throughout the world.

Through intimate coffee shop
meetings, members discuss the pro-
motion of rights not only in the United
States, but intemationally. The group’s
goal is to spread the word around cam-
pus about these issues.

Lauren Singer, a junior, is the
president of the group.

“We‘re just trying to get people'at
Pitt to increase their awareness in
terms of global events, and let them
know how privileged we are, as a
country, that we can express our
beliefs," she said.

More speciﬁcally, Amnesty works
to hold human rights abusers account-
able, stop violence against woman,
protect the environment and end the
death penalty, among a host of other
domestic and international issues.

This week, the group is helping to
sponsor Amnesty lnternational”s
Pittsburgh Film Festival, along with
Carnegie Mellon University and
Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

The event works to use the gener-
al popularity of film to promote
Amnesty’s cause.

Katie Shuler, a sophomore and
member of Amnesty. thinks the festi-
val plays an important part in sparking
public interest in the promotion of
human rights.

"The goal of the festival is to get
people angry about violations of
human rights,“ she said. “The films
use specific cases to get people to feel
something about injustice.”

Amnesty holds another event,
Jamnesty, on Pitt’s campus each
semester. In past years they went at it
alone, but for their latest event, held
March 27, they joined forces with
Amnesty groups from Pitt-
Greensburg. CMU, Duquesne
University. Carlow College and St.
Vincent’s College to produce a live

dancers.

The event worked to raise money
for one of their most prevalent causes
this year — teaching people about the
civil war in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo.

According to Amnesty

Internationals Web site, this violent .

conflict has claimed the lives of more
than three million people since‘ 1998
and has involved at least eight coun-
tries and numerous armed groups.
“There’s not a lot of reports about

what’s going on over there. It’s a‘

major civil war — one of the bloodi-
est wars in the history of Africa,”
Singer said. “We feel that if more peo-
ple knew, they would want to do
something about it.”

Past Jamnesty shows concerned
HIV/AIDS awareness, as well as rais-
ing concem about the situations of
international refugees.

Pitt’s Amnesty chapter also partic-
ipates in the yearly Write-a—thon, put
on by Amnesty Pittsburgh. This major
letter—w1iting campaign is based on
human rights themes to promote
change in govemments all over the
world.

A large part of the Amnesty’s
active work involves participation in
demonstrations. Last fall, members
attended an anti—death penalty march
in Harrisburg, hosted by Pennsylvania
Abolitionists United Against the
Death Penalty. as well as taking part in
many campus marches.

This year, the group hopes to raise
enough money to send representatives
to Amnesty’s annual general meeting
next month in Brooklyn. The meeting
brings all the Amnesty chapters
together to get in touch with the
national agenda this year — the war
on terror and respecting human rights.

Concerning the war on terror,
Singer said the Pitt Amnesty chapter is
more specifically concerned with the
loose language of the USA PATRIOT
Act, which she said allows for the
invasion of privacy.

V Not only does Pitt’s chapter work
actively on campus, but they also pro-
mote the importance of a responsible
government to students and others.

Kate Dalton is in charge of public
relations for the group.

“its important for each one of us
to step up and work for the fundamen-
tal rights of everyone —- to give our-
selves a globalist perspective and not
be so apathetic," she said. “It’s easy to
get sucked in by everyday stuff, but
we just think it‘s important to expand
your horizons.“

Pitt’s Amnesty chapter holds
meetings on Wednesdays, at 8:45
p.m., at Kiva Han on Craig Street. For

tival this week, go to

Scientists questioning the
effects of anti—depressants

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

When teens in the United States feel
the need to do something about depression,
many tum to a class of prescription anti-
depressant medications known as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIS),
which, for the past 15 years, have been the
most widely prescribed drugs for depres-
_sion.

Through television commercials and
print ads, the American public has become
familiar with SSRI names like Prozac,
Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor, Lexapro, and
Celexa.

But questions have been, raised in
recent years by government health agencies
from Washington to London about the
effectiveness, and even possible dangers, of
this class of drugs for adolescents and teen-
agers who take them.

The question of whether they should
be used by people younger than , 18 has
been met with a recent hard-line stance
from the United Kingdom where, from
June through December of 2003, the
British Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency, the British equivalent

, of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,

barmed all of thehbove named SSRI drugs

except Prozac. The agency cited study
results showing that not only were such
drugs not beneﬁcial to children, but that
young people taking these SSRIS were
twice as likely to commit suicide, at a rate
of 3.2 percent, compared to non—users, at
1.5 percent.

Since the fall of 2002, the FDA has
investigated the side effects of Paxil, result-
ing inia series of subsequent warnings to
doctors. In July 2003, the FDA cautioned

doctors about prescribing the drug to young —

people, due to a possible increase in suici-
dal thinking. In October, they found that all
the above named SSRIs, except Prozac,
were no better than a placebo, at treating
depression in young people.

SSRIS make serotonin more available
to receptors in the brain by blocking its re-
uptake. ‘

Prozac is currently the only SSRI that
has received official FDA approval for the
treatment of adolescents and teen-agers,
largely because Prozac has had two posi-
tive studies published by its makers in that
area —— something no other SSRI has done.

According to Dr. David Brent, the
Academic Chief of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry at Western Psychiatric Institute

Alumnae celebrate women

LAURA J ERPI
Staff Writer

As the first woman police offi-
cer to ‘ever patrol the streets of
Pittsburgh riding in a police car,
Gwen Elliot was already making
history on her_ first night of duty.

But apparently this was not
enough for her. ‘

That evening, Elliot caught four

male thieves red-handed and became‘

the first woman to arrest four felons
in Pittsburgh.

The Pitt Alumnae Council cele-

brated Women’s History Month with
“Strong, Smart,
Successful: Women in the 2'1 st cen-
tury,” on Tuesday evening in Alumni
Hall’s Connolly Ballroom. A

A panel composed of Elliot, Kim
LaScola Needy, Terry Miller and
Rev. Catherine A. Munz, spoke at
the event. These women have all
Worked verylhard to earn the success
they have achieved. They spoke
about the ways in which they stay
motivated, in order to maintain their
hectic lives. ' _ ‘

Needy is an associate professor

and" the undergraduate program
director in the industrial engineering
department of Pitt’s School of
Engineering. She discussed the
ways in which she balances her fam-
ily and career. a

“Work is more like a gas than a
liquid or solid; it tends to expand,”
Needy said.

She warned the audience to ask
for help when dealing with the
everyday stressful occasions that
life brings, because no matter how
hard people try, they can’t do it all
alone.

Elliot is the former commander‘

of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police
and the founder of Gwen’s Girls, a

non—profit independent agency help— ,

ing at-risk girls in Allegheny
County. She spoke about achieving
success while trying to overcome
what she called the two’ major
strikes against her -5 being black
and being a woman. She emphasized
the idea that young girls need to be
taught to live up to their potential.

“You have to find your soul to
give you strength,” "Elliot said.

and Clinic,’ that doesn’t necessarily mean Prozac is better.
He pointed to ﬂawed studies for drugs like Celexa, which,
he said, had one positive and one negative study. The neg-
ative study had a 40 percent dropout rate, Brent explained,
and the group taking Celexa actually showed a lower rate
of “suicidal ideation,” than those taking a placebo. ,

“So, then, how can they say it’s causing suicidal
ideation?” Brent said. “It’s 

He added that, while he thinks the British medicines
agency “has a point” that SSRIs -don’t work well for
youths, he also believes the agency is wrong in associating
the drugs with suicidal behavior. ’

“It may be that, in one kid, that happened,” he said.
“But if you’ re talking statistically, in any of the studies they
reported, I Went back looked at the data, and there aren’t
statistically signiﬁcant differences in the rate of suicide.”

Another issue, according "to Brent, is that young peo-
ple generally metabolize the drugs more quickly than older
people. Each drug has what is called a half—life, which
refers to the period of time it takes for half the drug to be
eliminated. He said that, while Prozac has a relatively long
half—life, other SSRIs like Celexa and Paxil have much

shorter ones. This means that missing doses can make

painful symptoms of withdrawal more likely.

‘ ,“I’ve had patients who would forget to take [Paxil] for
a day, and they’d feel really bad, and they’d feel suicidal,”
he said. “Whereas with Prozac, I’m not encouraging peo-
ple not to take their medication, but forgetting it for one
day, youialmost can’t withdraw, because the half—life is 5
days.” _

iWhen Prozac was introduced in the late 1980s, it
replaced a family of drugs called tricyclics. According to

 

the public’s acceptability of SSRI drugs

Dr. Michael Thase, who is a professor of psychiatry at the

7 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the major down-
side of tricyclics was their potential lethality.

p‘”I‘he SSRIs were a whole lot easier to use, and almost '

inﬁnitely safer in terms of the likelihood you could kill
yourself with an overdose, which was the tragic irony of tri-
cyclics, as they were effective treatments of depression,” he
said. _

According Brent, however, there was one important
segment of the population in which tricyclics were not
effective. . .

, “They were very good drugs in adults, but they don’t
Work in kids,” he said. “We don’t really know why.”

Controversy over the effects of SSRIs is not new. In
November of 2000, prominent British Psychiatrist Dr.
David Healy had a ﬁve-year job offer withdrawn by the
University of Toronto for, among other things, criticizing
SSRIs as causing suicidal tendencies in some people. He
also spoke out against drug companies’ practice of selec-
tively releasing information about their drugs.

Dr. Thomas Laughren is part of the FDA’ s advisory
panel, which has been trying to determine the beneﬁts, as
well as the risks, of anti—depressant’use in young people by
going through study data released by drug companies.

The opening of hearings by the FDA on Feb. 2, in
which the FDA heard from the families of children who
had committed suicide after taking SSRIs, followed a ‘
J anuaiy memo that Laughren sent to members of the advi-
sory panel in which he claimed to ﬁnd little evidence that
anti—depressants are effective in children at all.

« The American College of N europsychopharmacology,
after doing its own study, released a report of its ﬁndings in
January, claiming that there is evidence that SSRIs are
effective for treating depression in children and teens, and

that they don’t increase suicidal behavior. But the neu-
ropsychopharmacology study did not have the same access
to drug companies’ unpublished data that the FDA has.‘

In a current study, sponsored by the National Institutes
of Mental Health, and called Treatment of Resistant
Depression Ir1 Adolescents, Brent is exploring the issue of
what to do -when children don’t respond to SSRIs.

He said that there has been a notable shift recently in
the public perception of the relationship between SSRIs
and psychotherapy. .

“In 1989, when [SSRIs] were ﬁrst introduced, people
were very reluctant to take them and very much more into
psychotherapy,” he said. “Now it’s the reverse, with people
much more wanting the pill and not wanting to put the time
in for psychotherapy.”

According to James Cox, the director of Pitt’s

—University Counseling Center, about 25 percent of the
roughly 2,000 students who come through Pitt’s counseling
center each year take some kind of prescription medication.
He said that the power mass media has over American soci-
ety’s perception of anti—depressants has played a part in the
popularity of such treatments.

“Today, there is a little more pressure on you to make
that decision about utilization of medication, and, as a ther-
apist, I think as we see more commercials on television,
there’s going to be more pressure,” he said.

’ Regardless of what appears in the media, Thase said
that people should not dismiss anti—depressants or psy-
chotherapy.

effects —— but the odds are that if you’re treated, you’re
going to do better than if you’re not treated,” he said.
‘Treatment doesn’t have to be medication. It can be thera-
py. It can be bo .”

Crime in South Oakland rises again

Beware of Oakland. South Oakland in
particular. There ‘was an increase in violent

crimes in 2003 compared to 2002 through-.3
out this area of Pittsburgh. And already in?

2004, there has been a rash of crimes report-
ed. The bulk of these crimes were commit-
ted in the area immediately surrounding Pitt
—-— South Oakland. I-"ff
If a violent criminal wanted to do some
evil deeds, South Oakland is a prime loca-
tion. Landlords, who should be concerned
with the upkeep of their neighborhoods, do
not live in the neighborhood. Some over-
charge their tenants and under—manage ‘their
buildings. Students populate the area
because Pitt has inadequate housing, so they
ﬂock to South Oakland for that oﬂ°-, but not
so oﬂ’-, campus space. The bar scene is one
of the best climates for criminal activity, and
South Oakland has its share of bars, too. '
South Oakland looks shabby, and the
majority of the residents do not have vested
interests in the neighborhood. It is a back-
drop for the campus community and rests in
the shadow of the Cathedral of Leaming.
This seems like an opportune time for Pitt to
launch a campaign: “South Oakland: Safe
for Students.” , '
The University already owns quite a bit
of Oakland. It is about time Pitt take owner-
ship of and clean up its backyard Otherwise,
the crime all around Pitt will continue to
increase as the standards of living gradually
decrease.
South Oakland is deﬁned as the part of

Oakland that lies south of Forbes Avenue.

‘ That is the same Forbes Avenue on which

Sennott Square,“ David Lawrence Hall,
Hillman Library, Litchﬁeld Tower and

'-‘Schenley Quad areall situated.

If Pitt would buy and manage some
more South Oakland real estate, making it a
student community, the crime rate could
quite possibly decrease.

As an urban campus, Pitt does what it
cantoensurethisisasafeplacetobe.
However, most of the students are not on
campus, and the violent crimes happening
around campus aifect 'Pitt’s clients — the
students and their families. As for communi-
ty decor, there are Pitt Project and Clean Up
Oakland efforts. However, South Oakland

should not just be a volunteer site; it should ‘

be recognized as a part of home. _
Imagine a South Oakland where there
are University lampposts and emergency
call boxes — not just in Bouquet Gardens,
but everywhere. It would be a place where
garbage . pick-up happens consistently.
Sidewalks and streets would be cleared and
salted during -those memorable winter
months. It might actually be a safe place .for

i the large number of Pitt students who live

there, and these students —— and their parents
— could thank Pitt for making and keeping
South Oakland safe.

Go ahead Pitt, invest in South Oakland.
The catchy slogan has already been created
for all marketing materials: “South Oakland:
Safe for Students.”

Dear Editor,
A few words by Associate  for
Student Affairs Birney Harrigan

(“University asks NPHC to expand,” The
Pitt News, March 23) got me thinking.
Harrigan stated that certain administrative
moves are motivated by a desire to make
the fraternities and sororities more
“vibrant” and “eﬂ.°ective.” I just wanted to
publicly question some of these more
recent moves, focusing on Zeta Beta Tau,
as it just made The Pitt News headlines
for a questionable suspension elongation.
_ As it has come to the attention of
myself and everyone else who read The
Pitt News on March 25, ZBT has received
an extra semester of suspension. What
was the reason for this suspension?
Apparenﬂy, overzealous ZBT brothers
broke a small hole in a door in their own
house to, of all things, obtain access to
cleaning supplies to clean their own house
so the school cleaning staif would not
have to do so. 0
Was this smart? For a chapter histor-
ically ranking among top ﬁatemity QPAs

0 — ironically no.

Was this noble? Under today’s set
conditions of heroes — not at all.

Was it warranting of anoﬂier entire
semester of suspension? In efforts to keep
fraternities more “vibrant” and “strong,”

I the University seems to think so.

ZB'T, in addition to not being allowed
to “host, sponsor, co-sponsor or partici-
pate in any social activity with non—mem-.
bers ANYWHERE [sic],” is not allowed
to participate in IFC events. This means
no Greek Week. For those of you who do

not know what Greek Week is, it’s a year- _

long University event ﬂiat raises money
for charity via the work of fraternities and
sororities — around tens of thousands of

 

dollars each year. The University no
longer wishes ZBT and other suspended
fraternities to contribute to this ﬁmd. ZBT
is also not allowed to sponsor their third
armual beneﬁt concert for-the Leukemia
and Lymphoma Research Society. Not to
mention that suspended fraternities are
barmed from other non—alcohol-related
events, the very events I wo11ld suspect
the University would want to encourage,
namely sports. '

Even though I am now no longer

active, but an alum of Pitt’s Greek system, '

I wanted to still toss in my two cents and
commend" the University for such a
valiant effort of cutting down these threat-
ening groups — stopping them from
throwingiregulated parties in ﬁre-coded

v buildings with police walk-throughs —

it’s much better for students to party in a
South Oakland ﬁretrap. I want to bless the
University for stopping multiple fraterni-
ties ﬁorn participating in intramurals —

the Cost Center is a much safer place now. -

And ﬁnally and foremost, on behalf of
charitable organizations in the greater
Pittsburgh area and beyond, bless the
University of Pittsburgh for cutting these

organizations ‘off at the knees when it

comes to raising and donating money.
. I’m sure the “vibrant ’ and “effective”

groups that rise out of these well-thought-.

out punishments will be very thankful to
the wise administration in the end. Which

raises another interesting situation. When '

these suspended groups’ memberships
fall so low dueto near-irnpossible recruit-
ing under their suspensions, will they then
be punished once again for not having
enough members? i

THE PITT NEWS 

Thursday, April l,‘2004

I took a puff, and then the girl
you have seen on the commercials
and I made beautiful love and creat-
ed a baby.

We would not have done it oth-
erwise, you see, but the irresistible
aphrodisiac of marijuana —— and
marijuana‘ alone -—— led to the
inevitable baby-making procedure
and thus ruined both of ourlives.

Furthermore, there is a distinct
possibility that the inhaling of the
green substance alone impregnated
her — not the act of copulation
itself.

Down the street, a posse of
smokers ran over a little girl on a

bike while exiting a drive—through_

window.
A small child drowned while her
babysitter smoked a joint and Ganja

fired a loaded gun, killing a teen_’s,

smoking partner.
While these sorts of things play

down the everyday depictions of the

dangers marijuana presents, the one
that really convinced me of the

society—ruining impact widespread_

marijuana use can have was the new
commercial of a high school swim
team left without an anchor while
their teammate smoked up.

That, friends, we just cannot
have.

The incidents I cite are, of

"marijuana, as www.medi-.

course, the more, uh, creative part
of the government’s ongoing media

campaign against drugs, with mari-
juana being the primary target.
These outlandish situ-
ations are apparently
“realistic portrayals” of .
the harmful effects of

acampaign.org states,
intended to show . the
“benefits of a drug-free

lifestyle.”
So how successful has
the Drug Czar John

Walters been in his cam-

paign?

An independent ‘study
by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse found that, $185 million
later, “there is no evidence consis-
tent withpa desirable effect of the
Campaign on youth.” 9
Additionally, teenagers who saw

the advertisements. most often

“tended to move more markedly in a .

‘pro-drug’ direction.”

Needless to say, ‘$185 million
was not needed to achieve these
results. ' I

We could have just bought an

eighth. W

Not only has this struggle
against marijuana been tremendous-
ly ineffective —— as the figures

above, its rise in popularity, and its
easy ac_cessibility show.

The focus on marijuana itself
has clearly been misguided. ‘

Anyone seriously
interested in the ongoing
debate already knows
that the ‘dangers associ-
ated with marijuana have
long been exaggerated,
especially considering
the legal status of tobac-
co and alcohol, both of
which are arguably more
dangerous to the health
of an individual.

While the physiolog-
ical addiction myth in
particular has been dispelled, the
“gateway effect” remains the chief
concern of the opponents of relaxed
laws on possession of marijuana.

However, of the 70 million plus

 

Americans who have’ tried marijua-

na, 83 percent have never tried
cocaine. , ’

And in» 1991 — when the
Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse started collecting its data —.
the use of marijuana has climbed,
while the cocaine rates remained
steady. ' ‘ .

While these numbers certainly

do not support the validity of the

gateway effect, the success of other

An honest look at the real dangers of marijuana

governments in handling identical
concerns should serve as a model.

Legalizing marijuana in govern-
ment-regulated coffee
order to discourage the use of hard-
er drugs — the drug policy of the
Dutch — has been a success.

While there has been an
increase in marijuana use, a similar
result has been "conspicuously

’ absent in the case of serious drugs.

. This war onlmarijuana has
shown itself. to be misguided,’
wasteful and, ultimately, a losing
cause. ‘

Instead of continuing to pursue
a fleeting goal of eliminating its
presence as a popular recreation
drug, we should cease the silly
media campaign that has succeeded
only in amusing the vast majority of
people.

We should follow the example
of other Western countries and
make the sensible choice on mari-

juana, lfocusinglmore on the serious

drugs. - q

Urban fright pervades, andnot just on Devil’s Night

When you say scary, what holiday do you most
often think of? Halloween? Devil’s
Night? For most communities, the
most dangerous and frightening of
holidays is Halloween. You see lots
of pranks, paintball attacks, broken
windows and the like.

However, such is not the case in
my neighborhood. _ .

While most of my friends were
out partying this New Year’s Eve, I
worked until 11 p.m., and decided to
just head home for a nice quiet night
with my parents, a night full of Asti,
video games, and my date for the
night, Dick Clark.

It was a busy night at the hospital where I
work, and I joked about not wanting to stay past
my shift for fear of getting shot at while coming
home. The sad thing is, I was serious. My mother
is the president and dispatcher for our city’s Crime

Resistance Committee, so she had her police scan-

ner on.

Sure enough, right after the big ball dropped up
in Times Square, we began hearing calls for shots
fired on almost every street in the lower part of

, town. We laughed them off, half expecting to hear

these calls throughout the night. We went about our
business, watching television and, later, playing
Mario Party 5, until a little before 1:30 a.m.

 

Daveen Rae Kurutz

All of the sudden, ;we»heard a call come over
the scanner~about,o'ur neighbors ~having a
drunken manpounding on their door. Out
of nowhere, weheard shouts and pound-
ing footstepsoutsideiour house. ‘Within a

We observed the man! pinned on the
lawn of our 90-year-old ‘neighbor’s house,
and couldn’t believe this was happening
at 1:30 in the morning. We later found out

the man also tried, to; jump our "5—foo»ti

came home to find that an abandoned, stolen car

generously air—conditioned our living room by
throwing a brick through our front window.

66The

“The Reckoning”
Starring Willem Dafoe, Paul Bettany, Brian
Cox A

Directed by Paul McGuigan

71‘s'1/2 '

After a medieval acting troupe spends decades
performing Biblical plays, who can blame them
for trying to spice up the stage with a secular
scandal? But when the new play proves to be bet-
ter suited for an episode of “Law and Order,”
audiences past and present may wish they’d stuck
with the classics. . 9

Set in 14th-century Britain, Paul McGuigan’s
“The Reckoning” follows the evolution of a play

from a reenactment of Genesis to an effective‘

homicide investigation; The result is an unlikely
fusion of early morality plays and forensic pathol-

°gY- . » . .
In the first moments of “The Reckoning,”

Father Nicholas (Paul Bettany) succumbs to
temptation, and falls into bed with a married

woman. Defrocked and on the run, he stumbles
upon a band of traveling actors. After winning the
favor of the leader, Martin (Willem Dafoe),
Nicholas puts his past behind him and joins the
troupe. V

Nicholas and company arrive in the next town
just in time for the condemnation of a deaf-mute
woman accused of murdering a young man.’ While

 

‘townsfolk about

ering material for a new
play, Nicholas’ first gig
becomes a quest for
redemption. The W
woman (Elvira
Minguez) proves her
innocence to the
strangers, and the fall-
en-priest-turned-actor
willstop at nothing to
rescue her. To win- the
support of the towns.-
folk, Martin’s ' gang
decides to perform -her
true story.

Before adapting the
tale .to the stage,_ V
Nicholas must find the
victim’s actual killer,

murder is disjointed

and poorly paced, leav- .
ing gaps of absolutely no action and overcompli-
cating the events of the crime. Nicholas attempts
to establish suspects and a timeline, but gets
nowhere without the help of a King’s Justice. The

officer occasionally drops by with enough hints to

get Nicholas back on track. , .
When the meetings start to add up, we can’t
help but ques-

face of the potentially dramatic issues. Sadly, as
soon as we meet Nicholas, the priest falls from
grace via a sordid affair told through choppy cuts.
After the life-altering event, McGuigan never
gives us more of the character than a perpetual
frown of remorse. While Black Plague Victims are
offhandedly mentioned, “The Reckoning” doesn’t
come close to capturing the epidemic’s devasta-
tion.

Interaction between the main players leaves
much to be desired. Nicholas and Martin are
instant friends’, yet their ‘personal contact mainly
consists of exchanging smiles and lucky pen-
dants. The rest of the nomadic troupe, with the
exception of grumpy Tobias (Brian Cox), is about
as talkative and engaging as the horse pulling
their wagon of props.

Before Martin and Nicholas try to enliven the
stage, “The Reckoning” gives us a highly stylized
glimpse of morality plays. The exaggerated
movements and colorful sets seem to hav_e fallen
straight out of pre—Renaissance paintings.

When demonstrating the morality play’s poet-
ic dialogue and ethereal atmosphere, the one-
dimensionality of “The Reckoning” is appropri-
ate. However, McGuigan’s method is ineffective
when the troupe steps off the stage and tries to
tackle real-life drama.

The Reckoning opens in theaters Friday.

IAN REED
Staff Writer

Yes, the Recording Industry Association of
America has sued almost 2,000 people to date.
Most of these suits have been brought against col-
lege students. They have sued students who have
become accustomed to peer—to-peer file—sharing
services over the past few years and now expect to
get music for free. _

Downloading music is like shoplifting. In fact,
downloading music is like stealing anything +
it’s wrong. Yet so many people do it. The worst
part is that they think that it’s OK.

Many of these students say, “Look, they are
charging too much for CDs, so I’m not paying.”
What’s up with that? What would happen if I went
to the bookstore, decided that they were charging
too much money for a book, then stole it? I’d get
arrested. Just because I think that something costs
too much doesn’t meanthat it’s fair game for
theft. ’

And wait until you hear this one; it’s my-
favorite. “Downloading music is like borrowing a
book from the library. They don’t charge you at

the library, so you shouldn’t have to pay to down-

load. What’s the difference?” The difference is ,

that when you borrow something from the library,
you have to give it back.

Another classic is, “Artists don’t make any
money on CDs. They make all their money on
concert tickets. When I purchase a CD, the artists
are only getting a fewcents. Would Eddie Vedder
pick up a few cents if he found them on the street?
Probably not.” 

I have a couple of problems with this logic.
First, it doesn’t matter how much you steal from
someone, it’s still wrong. And those few cents add
up quickly. Second, Eddie Vedder probably would
pick up a few cents if he found them on the street,
if that’s what he did for a living. He makes music
as a career, and all of those “few cents” are being
taken from him.’Third, CD sales mean-power. If

-you don’t,sell CDs,_ you are not going to get the

opportunity to get money from concert tickets. CD
sales also mean more freedom. For example,
because Radiohead’s 0.K. Computersold well,
EMI let them take» as long as they wanted with
their follow-up album, Kid A. And we all know

j what a masterpiece that was.

Thou shalt notdownload songs fromthe Internet

Many an artist has fallen prey to downloaded
music. Some say, “Hey, downloading music
increases sales.” A quick look at the CD sales
charts proves this theory wrong. ‘CD sales have
been on the declinessince 2002. I am willing to
admit that, in some strange circumstances,
Internet distribution may be fruitful for the indus-
try. But for every artist who gets anywhere as a
result of Internet distribution, there are 10 or 20
who get screwed.

One last thing — What is going to become of
our beloved album? I fear that artists will only
release singles. And it’s a shame. A great album of
musical pieces is much greater than the sum of its
parts. When we are old and gray, we will be telling
our kids about something “called an “album.”

“What’s that, daddy?” your child will ask. _ ‘

“Well, it used to be a collection of different
musical pieces packaged together,” you’ll reply.
That’s a horrible future to even consider.

So, what’s my solution? I don’t have one. But
I can recommend this golden rule: Do not down-
load a song instead of purchasing it. Therefore,
there should be only one way to download music
—— if you already own the CD.

The David Bond Group
isn’t all that jazzed

The Spirit Speaks

David Bond Group
Vineyard Records

'7i‘r1/2

Recommended if you like:
The Bad Plus, some John
Coltrane

The current college generation
doesn’t seem to have a deep—rooted
love for jazz. Then again, no one
can wear a Charles Mingus T—shirt
or have Thelonious Monk patches
or pins all over his or her backpack,
so it’s not like anyone can wear it
on his or her sleeve. V

Regardless, jazz is something
that shouldn’t be "taken for granted.
Artists like Ornette Coleman, Bo
Diddley and Dave Brubeck should
be played on more radio stations —
not just by the poorly funded jazz
stations of today. However, the
David Bond Group isn’t Mingus. It
isn’t Coleman or Monk. This jazz
quartet isn’t really anything special.

The band plays well together.
David Bond, the saxophone player,
is decent at what he does, but some-

times his music sounds like
elevator music. Meanwhile,
pianist Bob Butta does a
pretty good job of mixing
things up, but doesn’t do
anything that screams —
“this is what makes me a
great piano player.”

The rest of the band sits
idly in the background doing
what they do——not much.

To listen to a band that
doesn’t do much in terms of
their music isn’t as much fun
as, say, watching grass grow.
It’s too much small change
that doesn’t do anything. It
becomes too consistently
inconsistent, and thus bor-
ing. Smooth, but still boring.

However, the music is

rather pleasant. It’s not’

something that’ll_ distract
you from work or keep your
mind on your radio — dis-
tracting you from the road,
causing a four—car pile-up.

It’s suitable for easy listening kind of record you’d really pick out Group. ,

and eating at a nice sit-down restau-

of a crowd and listen to because you
rant like Joe Mama’s, but not the can’t get enough of that David Bond

Achy, breaky hearts are finding a new love for country music

If you had asked me three years
ago what kind of music I liked, I
would have told you, a little bit of
everything except country. I’d heard

_a couple country songs here and

there. They sounded like real gun-
toting hick music. I assumed that if
it wasn’t downright redneck stuff, it
was whiny garbage about being
dumped and having your _dog run
over by a pickup truck.

But then the strangest thing
happened. My best_friend started
dating a “country boy.” Of course, I
was then forced to listen to the
country radio stations whenever I
was in the car with her, since this

guy’s taste somehow
wore off on her. Before I
realized it, I knew the
lyrics to some of the
songs well enough to
sing along. And I liked it.

Granted, I grew up in
a small, rural town, so
maybe I was primed for
this musical conversion
through some kind of
cowpoke genetics. But I
grew up listening to my

mother’s Zeppelin and

‘Rolling Stones, g my
brother’s rap, and I soon

thing from hard to punk
to the occasional dread-

covered country music in
the summer of 2001, it
was totally unexpected.
Country crept up on
me. The music is
absolutely infectious.
It’ll get under your skin
and get stuck in your

ly. You can’t listen to a

lines. It is quite possibly the best
music to sing along to. _
"Part of the reason for this is

because, contrary to popularbelief, V

there is musical skill involved in
this music. No, it’s not blow-you-
away complex and innovative
instrumentation,’ but it’s not bland
guitar—plucking either. Country falls
somewhere in between,‘ in a. place
where you" get a good balance
between‘ lyrics you can hear and
instruments that can rock out. And,
hey, country mus_icians actually
pick up their instruments and play
their songs, which is more than I
can say for the “musicians” in some
genres. And when it comes to
singing, country’s got the good
stuff. What you hear on the radio or
an album is exactly what you get in
concert: singers with genuinely
pleasing and strong voices. Go to a
concert lately and find out that your
favorite lead singer’s voice gets a
big makeover in the studio? What a
shame.

However, I’m not going to deny
that some country music really is
hick stuff. There are songs about
tractors, bars, growing up on farms
and loving America. But there are
also songs’ about the very same
-things you’ll hear in other music
genres, like love, being _young,
being mad, or any of the other ran-
dom things songwriters come up
with. As for the “_my dog got run
over” stereotype (that Iheard only
one week ago), it is complete bull. I
doubt I’ve ever heard a country
song about a dead dog. And when
the songs are sappy or sad, they’re
no more “depressing” than what

you’ll hear in other genres. If any- 5

thing, country musicians can make
these songs enjoyable, ‘too. (Listen
to Gary Allan and Tim McGraw).

Of ‘course, I’m not, saying all
country music is good. Sometimes
country’s tendency to tell along
narrative tale in a four-minute song
works on my nerves, too.
Sometimes the point of the song
just seems stupid. Sometimes the
over-the-top-political message of
someone like Toby Keith makes me
want to throw up. But do you love
every band or singer in your
favorite genre? I don’t even love
every song by my" favorite band
(which is not a country band, by the
way-). It’s really not fair to pigeon-
hole an entire style based on such
anomalies.

Tune to a country station while
you’re driving in your car with the

windows down. Try some Tim.

Formerly lknown as “The Bachelor,” Bob

Guiney isn’t kissing women anymore

Before he was the funny guy on
the ABC’s “The Bachelorette” or

.kissing all the women on “The

Bachelor,” Bob Guiney was in a
band called Fat Amy. After two
independent album’ releases, a slew
of Midwestrtours and several
record—label rejections, Fat Amy
went on hiatus. But now Bob’s back,

he’s got a nationally released album,.

and he’s coming to the Rex Theatre.

In the wake of the Bob craziness
sparked by the ABC shows, Wind-
up Records signed Guiney to its
label after rejecting his band five
years earlier. In November,
Guiney’s album, 3 Sides, which fea-
tures songs written and co—written
by Guiney, was in your local record
store." "On April 1, he and his four-
member band —'— including two orig-
inal Fat Amy members, and Joel
Ferguson of The Verve Pipe on gui-
tar — will hit Pittsburgh with songs
off the 10-song release as part of
their national tour. The lead single
off the album, “Girlfriend,” is repre-
sentative of their Badlees-esque
sound, and features lyrics like

“Bring me my girlfriend/And a bot.—»

tle of wine/Bring me her future/Just
make sure it’s mine.” .

To preview Guiney’s sound for
yourself, check out his Web site at
www-.bobguiney.com. It boasts
music clips, the. music video for
“Girlfriend,” and video interviews
with Guiney and his band. In one
interview, Guiney states, “Music

pittnews.

has always been my first love. I cer-
tainly did not do a television show
to try and amount to anything with
music.” V '

In 2003, Guiney also published
his first book, “What a Difference a
Year Makes: How Life’s
Unexpected Setbacks Can Lead to
Unexpected Joy.” He says that writ-
ing this book really jumpstarted his
songwriting for 3 Sides.

PharrellWilliams has anew q
band he wants fans to hear about

Sitting Around Keeping
Score
Spymob
Ruthless Records
Recommended if you like:
Guster“ instrumentation with
Jamiroquai vocals ‘

Most people in the 16-30-year-old
age range have heard of Pharrell Williams

of the Neptunes. On the other hand, ever
having heard of the band Spymob seems

’ highly unlikely. ,

Perhaps that’s because Spymob has

- just recently released theirdebut album

Sitting Around Keeping Score. Making a
name for itself in 2003 as the band behind
N.E.R.D., Spymob is quickly becoming a
name less likely to forget.

The group brings a unique combina-
tion of rock, jazz and soul together, along
with the vocals of lead singer John Ostby
— reminiscent of the vocal stylings of
Prince and J amiroquai. _

A Drawing on the inﬂuences of Steely
Dan‘ and Jellyﬁsh and sharing the stage
with Jay-Z and David Bowie, the group

‘ has a rather diverse background.

Add to that the band’s usage of vin-
tage instruments, and you hear the unique
sound behind the band. Ostby keys a
Rhodes piano, guitarist -Brent Paschke
strums on a vintage Fender Strat, bassist
Christian Twigg plays a Fender Precision
bass guitar and Eric Fawcett completes
the four-man band on antique Ludwig
d_rums. A

The group has a style all its own —
which is one of the reasons why Williams

chose Spymob to bring live instrumenta-
tion on N.E.R.D.’s recut debut album In
Search Of’. i‘. V_ V  

Rolling Stone Search Of?

for its .incorporation. of Spymol!),,;:—wiiting,

“Credit has got.to:;goe to  'I\vigg
and Eric Fawcett for supplying Search
with dexterous, downright joyful bass and
drums.” '“  ‘A '

Perhaps there was no better time for
Spymob to launch their debut _albu1_r_t than

‘ now, as the group is beginning to mob the

music scene. _

The 11—song debut album begins witl1
amost appropriate visionary song “Z040.”
Much like the rest of the album’s songs,
Ostby tells a story through the lyrics.
“2040” combines e1ect:ronica with jazz to
predict the future.

“2040” is followed by one of the
catchiest songs on the album —— a track

David Bowie may have inﬂuenced —— “It .

Gets Me Going.”

Several tracks later, “On 1 Pilot
Mountain” makes you feel as if Guster is
teaming up with Phish on the Farmhouse
album.

, “Walking Under Green Leaves”
walks you through the winter months to
spring, with the combination of Ostby’s
keyboarding and vocal talents, while gui-
tar strings go wild in “Thinking of
Someone Else,” mixing jazz and pop
together. ' V

Hi There is no,doubtW1lliams is talented
in producing projects that may be around

for a while, and if that says anything for V

the future of Spymob, we may still be
hearing the band in the year “2040.”

A steady rain and a chill breeze
couldn’t cool off P.J. Hiser’s bat, as he
helped lead the Pitt baseball team to a 3-
1 win over Kent State in ﬁve innings on
Wednesday. -

.1-Iiser went two-for-tWo,. including
the garne-wiririing two-run home run in
the bottom of the fourth inning for the
Panthers (15-4) — his tearn-leading ninth
round-tripper of the season.

Pitt starting pitcher Paul Nardozzi

pitched. four innings, striking out three . A. if P A.

and walking two, while allowing one run
on four hits to pick up his second win of
the season. Evan Smith picked up the

loss for Kent State despite having retired

seven Panthersin a row at one point. ,
“It’s a matter of getting a feel for the

_ other pitcher,” Pitt head, coach Joe
J ordano said. “When you’re  Z1’ situation ,
that you have a feel for who’s on the‘

mound, you can take some good hacks.”
Pitt freshman second baseman Jim
Negrych singled up the middle to lead off
Pitt’s half of the fourth inning to become
the Panthers’ ﬁrst base runner since the
first - inning. The single extended
Negrych’s hitting streak to 11 games.
After taking a ball, Hiser —— who was
named Big East Player of the Week last
week ——- drilled Smith’s next pitch‘ to'left

ﬁeld. Kent State left ﬁelder Chad Kinyon -

Jordano said. “He’s been great, obvious‘-

This just in: Don’t play with guns, espe-
cially if you’re drunk

Unfortunately for former New Jersey
Nets center Jayson Williams, that advice
came too late —— not that he would’ve
adhered to it anyway.

Williams’ defense attorney, Billy
Martin, continues in his attempts to con-
vince jurors that the shooting death of chauf-
feur Costas “Gus” Christoﬁ was accidental.

. Williams is currently facing seven charges,

including aggravated manslaughter and wit-
ness tampering. If convicted on all counts,
he could face up to 55 years in prison.

As of now, experts have determined

« ‘ that debris found in the 12-gauge Browning

shotgun could have caused it to ﬁre without

. the trigger being pulled. A
Be that as it may, why was Williams, .

who, according to testimony, had alcohol in

his blood, fooling {around with a shotgun in
the middle ofﬂie night? A  

To make matters worse, witnesses have
come forward stating that Williams tam-
pered with evidence to make the shooting
look like a suicide. John Gordnick and Kent
Culuko, both friends of Williams, have
agreed to testify against Williams in
exchange for a plea-bargain deal.

Prosecutors have painted a pretty ugly
picture of Williams, while the defense main-
tains that this was-nothing more than an
accident

Thetrutliistliattliiswasfarfromthe
ﬁrst time that Williams had a mishap that
involved ﬁrearms. This was in no way an
isolated incident. '

Back in 1994, Williams was charged
with reckless endangerment after he acci-
dentally ﬁred a .45 caliber pistol and a bullet
struck an unoccupied vehicle in a parking
lot. He avoided a felony conviction by

Victories in college sports often come
down to small margins,‘especially this time
of year, when it seems like there is a basket-
ball game decided by one point on television

every day, breaking the hearts of the losing

school," coaches and, most of all, players.

The Pitt gymnastics team certainly
doesn’t need to be told how devastating one
point can be. So much less can be just as
heartbreaking. _

When NCAA regional qualifying
scores came out last Week, Pitt was left on
the outside looking in by the smallest possi-
ble margin — 0.005 points — ending its
year without the postseason appearance the
Panthers sought all season.

“It’s not even a fall  that’s one little
misstep, one little step out of bounds, one
stumble on a landing, even just one judge’s
bad decision,” said head coach Debbie
Yohman, on just how close her team was to
extending its season. ‘

Pitt was beaten to the ﬁnish line by East
Atlantic Gymnastics League rival New
Hampshire, despite ﬁnishing ahead of the
Wildcats in the EAGL championships. New

Hampshire beat the Panthers in a dual meet

Spring season brings pleasantmemories of baseball

 

Whether it snows next Monday or the
temperature blows past 90, that special feel-
ingisintheair.All 30MajorI_eagueteams
will be suiting up, which means it’s time for
baseball.

The smell of the freshly cut grass and

_ the cool spring breeze that oftentimes blows
through the air bring the promise of a long
summer spent listening to the crack of a
wooden bat and the smack of a leather glove.

There really are no ﬁner smells and
sounds than the ones that baseball brings
with it.

This time of year always brings back
memories of younger days: the ﬁrst time I
put on a glove, the ﬁrst time my bat connect-
ed with a ball, and the last time I ever stepped
up to the plate.

But one memory that stands out makes
my passion for this game even greater than
any sight, sound or smell ever co11ld

It was my last year of little league, and
my team stunk. Actually, most of our league

The city that I grew up in divided up its
youth league into four sections — north,
south, east and west.

Although the location of my parents’
house put us in the southern part of the city,
they decided that my younger brother and I
would play in.tl1e eastem district The com-
petition irr our district was ﬁerce, and rather
than teach us that winning was the only
thing, my parents wanted us to go out and
have fun.

’ My ﬁrst two years of little league were
spent cowering in the far comer of the bat-
ter’s box, scared to death I would get hit by
a pitch and die. I must have set some kind of
world record for plate appearances without
ever having the bat leave my shoulder.

Finally, in my last at-bat during that sec-
ond season, I ﬂailed at the ball and actually
got a hit My parents and coaches were
shocked So wasl, asljust stood there inthe
box, not quite sure what to do.

Fast-forward a little less than two years.
I had gone frompbeing one of the youngsters
on the team to the oldest I’d say I was one
of the bigger guys on the team, too, but
you’d never believe me.

I had gone from being the kid the coach
stuck in right ﬁeld to the tearn’s regular
catcher. ‘

i In those days, playinglthe outﬁeld was
either a punishment or the spot where you

on a consistent basis — especially to right
ﬁeld — and playing anlinning out there usu-
ally meant kicking at the weeds.

Likelsaid, ourtearnthatyearwasbad
— how ﬁtting was it that we were named the
Bears? We had one pitcher who could con-
sistently get the ball over the plate and there
were only three of us who could hit the ball
out of the inﬁeld on ﬂre ﬂy.

Among my teammates was one guy
who couldn’t have stood more than four and
a half feet tall. He looked so young that it
didn’t seem possible that he could have
made the age requirement to play in this
league. ' I

But he was — the number of kids with
false birth certiﬁcates was fairly low that
year — although I never knew exacﬂy how
old he was. ‘

I always thought he was much younger
mainly because of how short he was. I’m not
close to being tall, and this fellow barely
came up to the top of my chest. Tough to
strike out someone that short, but just as dif-
ﬁcult for him to get a hit.

But that — along with the position in
right ﬁeld —— sure didn’t keep him from try-
ing. . .
As the season wore on, we became
friends, chatting it up. when our team was at
bat and throwing each other words of
encouragement on the ﬁeld But while I was
having one of my best seasons on the dia-
mond, he struggled, mainly due to his short

stature. _

I wondered why he never seemed ﬁns-
trated and how he could continue. After
striking out three times on my birthday that
year — which I thought had to be the worst
birthday present in the history of the world
—-—. I nearly decided to quit out of frustration.
But he kept going. ’

Two things happened toward the end of

- that season that helped me understand why.

VV1th about eight games left in the sea-
son, I was hit square on the ankle with a pitch
—- what a surprise, I didn’t ‘die. The other
catcher on the team didn’t show up that day,
so I had‘ to continue playing the rest of the
game. . ’

My ankle swelled up to about the size of
a baseball, and I had a hard time buckling the
guards on that leg by ‘myself. Seeing .how

much pain I wasyin, ﬂie kid helped before -

and after every inning — he didn’t make _it
into that game, despite our team having only
10 players — making sure they were fas-
tened and secure before I went out on the
ﬁeld.

Then, in the last game of the season —

‘my ﬁnal little league game — our coach

became ill and sent his wife to the ﬁeld in his
place. Having never really watched us play
before, she put together the lineup on a

Kent State threatened in the top of the
fourth. With one out, Adam Crowder
dropped a single into shallow left center
ﬁeld. Holick followed by drawing a walk

Emmarmuel Burriss worked the count

second, doubling up Holick and helping Pitt
get out of the inning unscathed. e _
" Both teams went down in order to com-
plete the fifth inning and they tried to get
through the sixth before the umpires called
the game.

“It was the right decision [by the
umpires] to stop it at the spot that we did,”
said Jordano. “Right now, home plate is
under water. When the turf is wet, it
becomes a faster game. Youtry to keep it
dry but that’s a difficult thing in a steady

Guns and alcohol a bad combination

Walker, page 19

V New Jersey newspaper.

Williams’ ﬁm ‘n’ gun anticsVdidn’t stop

' ' e target shooting on his riﬂe range,
he accidentally  his gun , only-inches
away iﬁiom "New York Jets star Wayne
Chrebet, leaving the wide receiver knocked
out, with gimpowder on his face.

In his autobiography, titled “Loose
Balls” -— “Loose Cannon” might have been
a more ﬁtting title ——‘ Williams admitted to
getting drunk and aiming an unloaded gun at

J ‘ former NBA player Manute Bo1’s uncle.

And’ as if that’weren’t enough, in 2001,
Williams really lost control. '

According to court _ documents,
Williams spent a‘ night drinking with former
teammate Dwayne Schintzius. After losing a
bet that hadsomething to do with his rot-

tweiler, Zeus, Williams shot the dog twice V

with a double-barrel shotgun. According to
Schintzius, after the second blast decapitated

the animal, Williams then reloaded the shot- '

gun, pointed it at him and said, “get ﬂiis
(expletive deleted) dog oﬁ my porch or
you’re next.” .
Even with his past cases of showing a
blatant disregard for human ‘life, Williams
still might get off scot—free. Check that; this
incident will cost him, and more than just
legal fees. He’s already settled a wrongful
death suit with Chn'stoﬁ’s family for a
reported $2.75 million. Williams says that he
felt it was the right thing to do. But if he was
so worried about doing‘ the right thing, why

not come forward and tell the truth from the-

beginning  of trying to rub Christoﬁ’s
ﬁngerprints on the gun and make it look like
a suicide?

. _No,'W1lliams is not looking to do the’
right thing. With his warped mind, I doubt he

even knows what it means to do the right

thing. ,We’re talking about; a man who A

allegedly jshot his dog’s ,hea_d V. off and ' then
tumedtl1eg1monhisﬁiend.I’dhate tobehis
enemy-.__.      ’~(" ‘

‘Williams likes, to live life on the wild
side, to ﬂy by the seat of his pants, so to
speak. Only this rich guy—tumed—bad boy

poses a serious danger‘ to society. He’s not ‘

just another athlete who indulges himself in
sex, drugs and alcohol. His fetish is mixing
alcohol and guns, and that is a deadly com-
bination, to say the least. .
A few weeks back, Williams sat down

for an interview with Barbara Walters in.

which he confessed that he was “terriﬁed” at
the possibility of going to prison.

. “I have a beautiful family,” Williams
said. “I want to be here for my family. I want

to be here for my baby. I want to see the birth ' i

of my baby. Hopefully it’s a boy. He can play
for St. John’s. I don’t want to ever leave my
family over this accident”

I’m sure Christoﬁ had a beautiful fami-
ly that he didn’t want to leave either. I bet he
thought he had a pretty decent gig as the
chauffeur for a former NBA star. His life was

‘ unjustly cut short, and Williams does not
‘ deserve to walk ﬁee.

in the Northeast — to participate. Likewise,
the best individual on each apparatus not on
a qualifying team is invited. Zeﬁirds scores
put her atop the Northeast in botl1 her events.

To advance to the national competition,
0’ Connor — who is fourth regionally and
71st nationally — mustbe one of the top two
all-around gymnasts whose team was not

one of the two teams that will advance to ‘

nationals. V
Zeﬂiro, on the other hand, faces a
tougher road to nationals, although her

- coach disagreed _

“Alyse can do it on ﬂoor, because she’s
gotten a 10 before, she’s beaten most the
people she’s competing against, _and she’s
conﬁdent right now,” Yohman said of her
senior ‘specialist.

ForZefﬁro, who is ranked No. 1 region-
ally and 10th nationally on the ﬂoor, to
advance as a specialist, she must win each of
her events. Zeﬁiro is also ranked third hi the
region and 48th nationally on vault.

Madness, page 22

behind the plate, I was stuck in no man’s
land — tight ﬁeld. ‘ _ " 2

I couldn’t believe it. Four years later,
and there I was, back in the same spot: I had
started out. in. I sulkcd; I complained; I Went
back to kicking the weeds. ’

Running onto the ﬁeld near the end of
the game, Ilooked overtowards center ﬁeld,
which was where the kid was playing. I
wondered how he could take playing the
outﬁeld every game. Didn’t he get bored?
Didn’t he want to be involved in more of the
action? ' A

I watched him, in between pitches, ho
he’d run in behind second base, just in case
the catcher’s throw got past the pitcher and
the second baseman. Before every pitch,
he’d crouch down, just in case the ball came
to him — which it didn’t. And he did all of
it with a smile.

iFans enjoy the game, ratherthan players  

I

« As I watched, Ibegan to understand that
he didn’t care how far below .300 his batting
average was or if he made the game-winning -
catch.

He was enjoying himself wheﬂier it was
standing on top of the mound or siding on
the bench, cheering on his teammates. _

It wasn’t just a game — it went beyond
that And I’m sure he wasn’t the only young
‘child in this country that felt that way.

That’s why, today, despite the millions
spent and supplements popped, people still
go out to baseball games. They can’t relate to

, the players on the ﬁeld —— how many fans

are millionaires? ,\

But they can relate to the game, and
what it has meant to them since those early
days, when they were kicking the weeds.

Joe Mamhilena is the sports editor for 
Pitt News and wants to let everyone know
about his secret love qﬁair with baseball.‘

New HQ for secret society

NIKKI SCHWAB

The mansion will still be green.
V However, after a month-long
bidding war, Pitt’s newest fraternity,

I 1’ Delta Chi, has been outbid by Pitt’s

  

, ‘Chancellor

tin.

‘pong in the base-

 _ _oldest_secret society in an effort to
takeover the green mansion.

The green mansion, located on

 Dithridge Street in North Oakland,
‘ was. formerly occupied by Delta
 Sigma Phi, but after it was suspend-
edfrom, the University and had its
 charter revoked in the fall, the house
 was ’up~for grabs among other frater-
nities and student organizations.

That’s when the Druids stepped

Druid adviser Jack Daniel

explained that the decision simply.

made sense.

_ “To hell with IFC; the Druids’
have been representing the finest

young men and women this
University has to offer, and the base-_
ment is a perfect size for their
Stonehenge monument,” he said.

Daniel explained that the chan-
cellor wrote a $25,000 check as a
security deposit for
the mansion,

C h a n c e l l o r
Mark Nordenberg
would not comment
on the matter, but
Robert Hill, vice
chancellor for public
affairs, said that the
_ p was
looking forward to
good times at the
green mansion.

ment of one of our
finest residences in
North Oakland? It’s

tion for him  a

home, per se,” Hill
said. ,

The Druid presi-

dent, a tall male who can be seen fre-

,quently at the Student Government
Board office and drinking -at
Hemingway’s, who asked to remain
anonymous, explained that the deci-
sion was also made after the Druid
.“holy temple” was relocated from
the Cathedral of Learning to an
undisclosed janitorial closet on the
fourth floor. of the William Pitt
Union.

“Do you know how hard it is try-
ing to perform rituals, put on our
cloaks and kiss ass to the administra-
tion in a 4—foot-by-4-foot janitorial
suite?” the Druid president asked.

Druid Editor in Chief Greg
Heller-LaBelle explained that the
move was notnecessary.

, “I liked being in the closet. It
was convenient for me. I could stash
my cloak right in my office. Now
I’m going to have to walk all the way
to North Oakland and perform rituals
in a buildingthat permanently smells
like beer,” Heller-LaBelle said.

Heller-LaBelle added that the
Druids were looking into getting the
entire green mansion Lysol-ed.

“We wouldn’t want to get any
STDs,”-Heller-LaBelle said.

Druid Pledge Master Steve
Mihlfried, who was formerly IFC
president and a Pitt basketball play-
er, said that the Druids would be
moving into the mansion in late
August and would throw one hell of
a party once established.

“It’s incredible that we got such
a fantastic house; the basement is
large enough - to fit both the
Stonehenge monument and our beer
pong table,” Mihlfried said.

He added that the Druid pledges
had built the pong table during their
pledge process with the aid of their
mothers.

‘ “After what happened to TKE,
we realized that family involvement
can really improve an organization,”
Mihlfried said.

Basketball player and
Interfraternity Council President
Chevon Troutman explained that,
while he was disappointed that Delta
Chi lost the mansion, he sees good
things happening in the next year at
the green mansion.

“These Druids are hot man; they
are definitely Phi Slamma J amma
compatible if only they took off
their cloaks,” Troutman said.

T routman

takes over
as IFC head

GREG HELLER—LABELLE
One Editor to Rule Them All

Following the expulsion of every major
and minor Greek organization from Pitt’s
Student Life, Interfraternity Council
announced yesterday that it has named its
interim chair.

Chevon Troutman, of Pitt’s Phi Slamma

J amma fraternity, will take over as the inter— ~

im head of Pitt’s fraternity governance group.

“I’m really excited about this opportuni— -.

ty,” Troutman said at a press conference yes-
terday. “I have always wanted to be more
involved with Greek life on ‘Pitt’s campus.”

Troutman replaces Steve Mihlfried, of
Lambda Chi Alpha, who resigned last week
after allegations that he lost most of his fra-
ternity’s funds during a late—night poker
match with an alligator. The card game,
which was in violation of Pitt’s student code
of conduct, resulted in his fraternity’s suspen-
sion for 87 years.

“That,” Mihlfried said, “was a crazy
game of poker”

Troutman, meanwhile, said he already
has plans to rebuild Greek life on campus,
starting with the formation of partnerships
between Phi Slamma Jarnrna and the Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority.

“We have very compatible‘ organiza-
tions,” Troutman said. “I think we have com-
mon goals and can go a long way together.”

Vice Provost of Undergraduate Studies
and Dean of Students Jack Daniel said he

‘could not comment on any of the recent deci-
sions for legal reasons, but said he is looking

forward to working with Troutman.

“Chevy has shown great leadership on
thecourt,” Daniel said. “We fully expect him
to bring that leadership to Student Life.”

Daniel would not comment on whether

or, not Troutman was being considered for the
vacant position as head of Judicial Affairs,
which has been empty for three years. The

. fact that no one noticed until recently, Daniel

explained, was that no one was allowed to
talk about his or her decisions, anyway.

“Well, it’s like that situation where a tree
falls on a beer pong table, but if no one hears
it, it’s not really hazing,” he said.

The alligator could not be reached for
comment. —

Donkey Kong Jr. Math: The pyramidsgot nothin’ on 

Donkey Kong Jr. Math
Developed by Nintendo
Published by Nintendo
NES

7i‘n.‘r<L‘r.14159265

I don’t care about how “World
of Warcraft”’s demo test is going. I
don’t need a new “Final Fantasy” to
be happy. “Grand Theft Auto,”
“Gran Turismo,” “Need for Speed”
 They can all just drive off of a
cliff and die. I searched for a savior
on this dark and dreary day, and
what did I find hiding away on my
copy of “Animal Crossing”?

This little beauty.

The premise is simple. As
Donkey Kong Jr., you are charged
with appeasing your tyrannical

gorilla of a father by competing in
simple mathematic challenges

. against your evil purple doppel—

ganger. You put together a mathe-
matical equation in an attempt to
output the number that Donkey
Kong holds up on a sign. Seems
simple, right?

Keep in mind that all of the
mathematical operators and num-
bers are held up by antigravity and
the only way to grab them is to
climb on vines conveniently hang-

ing from the forest canopy. Your‘

reward for successfully navigating
the rainforest and beating your
opponent into a bloody pile of 
um, arithmetic residue? An apple.
What we have here isn’t just a
simple run-and-climb-and—number-
crunch piece‘ of edutainment won-

der from the heyday of the NES. It’s
a poignant look into the worlds of
child abuse, illegal cloning of pur-
ple mutants, theoretical physics,
rainforest conservation_ and a
healthy diet including atleast five
fruits and vegetables a day. These
are all important issues to this day,

and as such, I implore each and-

every reader to take heed, lest they
come face—to-face with a flying,
tree-hugging, lavender reﬂection of

_themselves. Scurvy is not a pretty

thing. ' - .
The graphics, while displaying a
marked lack of blood, violence and
full-breasted women, are sure to
delight children and the elderly
alike, as they watch gorilla—lets
romp and frolic under the supervi-
sion of a competent adult — who

happens to have a weekend job_
abducting plumbers’ girlfriends and ,

bludgeoning Pikachu’ with an
umbrella — while‘ affording the
opportunity to learn at the same
time._The controls are simple, as

‘was the norm when controllers had
but four buttons — including the _

start and select buttons -— and a
directional pad. ‘

.I can say, without a doubt, that
“Donkey‘Kong Jr.~Math” is twenty
times better than being hit in the
shins with a frozen pike eel. You’ll
wantto pitch your PS2, your XBox
and perhaps even your brand new
TI-93 calculator in the garbage dis-
posal after you play a couple hun-
dned hours of this Nintendo classic.

I know I have.

YOU THOUGHT WE WERE KIDDING?
All your activity fee are belong to us

After a pathetic showing in’ an
Alcoholic Olympiad last weekend,
Student Government Board, as per the
rules of the Olympiad, has surrendered
the entire Student Activities Fee to the
editorial staff at The Pitt News.

While it would be in poor taste to
reveal speciﬁc failings, if you ever need
a laugh, challenge Brian Kelly to a game
of quarters. You’d be unwise to choose
Todd Brandon Morris to be on your beer
pong team, and Liz Blasi can’t ﬂip a cup
to save her life.

But enough of that — no one can be
too surprised that The Pitt News kicked
the crap out of those pansies and drank
them under the table.

Now, with all the Student Activities
Fee money at our disposal, The Pitt
News would like to announce our well-
considered and fair choices of _how to

I disperse the zillions of your dollars that

we wrenched from the hands of that bas-
tionof. media conspiracy, SGB.

First, we are moving our editorial‘

ofﬁces ——- complete with the full bar and
the catwalk with the poles and "neon
lights — to the Green Mansion, and
erecting our Greek letters, Tau Rho Nu,
out front. We’ll begin holding Natty Ice
parties in a few weeks. Fo’ shizzle,
biatches. _ G ‘
Next, We’ll make sizeable campaign
contributions to the two candidates we
feel best represent our interests and our

huge editorial biases: George W. Bush
and Dennis Kucinich.
We will buy the rights to the

smoothest sippin’ whiskey this side of

Tennessee — Jack Daniel’s, of course.
We’ll copyright the name and all permu-
tations thereof, such that Dean of
Students and All Kinds of Other Stuff
Jack Daniel must pay a fee each time he
utters his own name. To compete
with our arch—enemy, Carnegie Mellon
University, We’ll be stepping up technol-
ogy. We will connect all buildings in the
Quad by way of elevated moving side-
walks -— how’s that for campus unity?
We ' will also install robotic, armed
guards —— all named Gunter —— in the
lobbies of all dorms. Take that, Valerie!

Pitt Program Council will only
receive enough money to sponsor week-
long Spring Break debauches in Mexico,
and only students associated with The
Pitt News — this includes having been
cited more than ﬁve times in the Police
Blotter — will be eligible.

And, in a nod to the little people
who so often get overlooked in the mys-
terious allocations process, The Pitt
News will build a micro-stadium for the
rugby team, right on the Cathedral lawn
where they’ve been forced to‘ practice
for years. _ ’

Anyone else needing money is wel-
come to check out the “research studies”
portion of the classiﬁeds.

Dear bullies: I’m as mad as heck,

Can’t anyone walk through an air-
port these days?

A lot of attention has been given to
me “bitch slapping” that slob of a man
Chris Famey as I sashayed through Sky

Harbor International
Airport in Phoenix.
OK, maybe not

sashayed — but it was
certainly a graceful,-
“Look at me; I’m fabu-
lous!” kind of strut. ,
All I wanted was to
board my ﬂight. The
autograph hounds and
amateur! paparazzi,
annoying as they are, I .
can deal with. But a’

andI’m not taking it anymore!

I planted on Farney was more in jest
than out of ill will — I thought it would
give him a funny story to tell all of his
fellow sweaty hog dealers and
wrestlers. But he took it too far. He’s
pressing charges. Why?
Is it because I have
money or because my
playful slap-slap dimin-
ished his manhood?
Either way, Richard
Simmons has been
called out, and Richard
Simmons isn’t taking
this lying down. _
Editor’s Note: At this
point, we ’d like to
advise anyone reading
this that Mr. Simmons
becomes quite irate,

sometime cage wrestler
making fun of my ‘
career and lifestyle?
That’s where I draw the line.

It’s been all over the news that
Famey -heckled me rather loudly in the
airport as I was seeing to my adoring
fans. I’ve.been told he said, “Look!
Richard Simmons. Drop your bags;
let’s sweat to the ‘50s.” It ~ sounds
vaguely familiar, but I honestly can’t
remember anything between the time I
was signing a copy of one of my work-
out tapes and when I was putting the
ﬁnishing touches on that love tap I put
on that face of Famey’s.

I guess you could say Isort of
blacked out.

I’ve also been told that I said, “It’s
not nice to make fun of people with

issues.” That would make sense .— it’s

a credo I’ve lived my life by. But what’s
the point now? All I do is try to help
overweight women with self—esteem
issues. I think I’m doing the world a
much-needed service. And what do I
get for it? A big jerk makes fun of me,
Richard Simmons — just a little exer-
cise fan in a tank top and sparkly shorts.

I’ve been made fun of before, but
this time was different. Sure, the “slap”

and his comments may
be unsuitable for small
children, people with
heart problems and anyone who sweats
to the oldies.

What’s the matter? Ashamed that a
guy half your size schooled your ass? I
read somewhere that your face was
slightly red after the slap, but it proba-
bly wasn’t from my love-tap beat-
down. What, were you crying? Were
you choking back the tears, remember-
ing those days you talked about in the
news when you’d watch my f tapes?
Could it be that you’re upset because
oneof your childhood idols laid the
smack down on you? Or is it that some-
one ﬁnally stood up to you and your
bullying ways? You stupid meathead!

How do like them apples? This
isn’t your mama’s Richard Simmons.
You’ve stirred a slumbering beast, and
it’s not going back to sleep until it’s
taught your punk ass that Milton
Richard Simmons is no one to be triﬂed
with. You big meanie.

Richard Simmons is a renowned ﬁtness
expert and celebrity. He wants you to
get out and shake your booty in the face
of bullies everywhere.

Hello sexually—active—yet-still-religious folks
out there. I bet you’ve been wondering: how you
can enjoy sex and still be a good Catholic. The
answer is, you can’t! That’s why The Pitt News
has a new advice column, Catholicism N’At, an
interesting look at sex and religion and why the
two don’t mix. If you’re even reading this, you
should feel guilty.

Dear Catholicism N’At, A _

Dear Never,

I’m so glad to know that you’ve been feeling
gay lately, it must be because you have the love
of Jesus in your heart. But even
though Jesus loves you, our 1 Lord
and Savior doesn’t love sodomy. To
avoid the eternal damnation of hell,
please refrain from both of your cur-
rent sexual practices. .As-for your
problem with your fellow male sin-
ner, try recommending marital sex
with a woman. May God be with
' you.‘ I

Dear Catholicism N’At,

ing for “someone else” in the bed-
room. Of course I’m assuming that
the two of you were married in a church because
if you weren’t, the sex you’re having is a terrible
sin, but since I’m sure that’s the case, let’s talk
about your third person in the sack. You really
should have tried this sooner, because you, your
husband and the Lord Jesus Christ should always
do everything together. Try making room for the
Holy Spirit next time you’re getting intimate.

Dear Rope,

I’m a bit unclear by your phrase “bop the

bishop.” If you are implying that you regularly
assault members of the clergy, I urge you to stop
immediately. I once heard that “bopping the bish-
op” was Satan—talk for the great sin of masturba-
tion. If this is want you are referring to, then I

recommend you start loving Jesus Christ more
and yourself less. Reading the Bible seven times
a day is just fine (although lotion won’t help

Dear Trying, 7 ‘ . ' ., . -
- Praise be to God that you are still in the most
blessed form of virginity. My advice to. you .
would be to buy a good lock for your door and-
confine yourself inside with only food, water,-'

avoiding menall together, you make the temptae , ,
1 tion to fornicate disappear! Even though you run _.

NICK KRATSAS

Demogogue

Friends, Pittsburghers,
muters—lend me your ears.

I write this column not to praise
Murphy, but to defeat him in 2006.

First of all, I want to thank all of
you who have given me your support.
Together, we will save this city.

For those of you who haven’t
given your support, I ask this simple
question: Why not?

I offer change and a new direction
in city politics, and all I ask for in
return is your support. As I stated pre-
viously, I will run for mayor in 2006,
but only if the citizens of Pittsburgh
want me to. ‘

I realize that you may .. wonder
about supporting an untested politi-
cian to be mayor of a somewhat major
metropolitan city, but have no fears.
Here’s what it comes down to:
Compared to what we have, anything

com-

would be better.

So, in this final plea for support, I
want to lay down a few things so that
you understand where I am coming
from.

Get ready to meet Nick Kratsas,
the candidate.

Since Democrats won’t support
me, and no one will vote for me as a
Republican, I plan to start my own
party. Populace of Pittsburgh, prepare
to embrace the Yinzer Party. While
this name may conjure up images of
Pittsburghers sporting mullets,
Wrestlemania T—shirts and driving
around our pothole-plagued streets in
a Camaro, I embrace this as a piece of

our culture and heritage. By redefin-

ing this term, my party and I will
show‘ that “yinzer” stands for
progress, not pierogies. The Yinzer
Party will follow the ideas of fiscal
conservatism to manage the city’s
finances while broadening social pro-
grams to entice people to come to the

city. —
“Fiscal responsibility? What’s
that?” you ask. ‘

It’s the exact opposite of when
Murphy gives a few tax dollars here
and there to encourage businesses that
lose money for the city, while not pay-
ing the city bills. See, instead of stop-
ping costly, risky projects, he contin-
ues them. And when it’s time to pay
the bills, he doesn’t cut spending or
raise revenue; he raises taxes and

blames everyone else for his misman-

agement. _ -

While the city sinks deeper into
financial debt, Murphy makes up_bud-
gets that operate as if the city has
money. What kind of mayor
announces that the city is in such
financial straits that the current city
budget will cause Pittsburgh. to run out
of money to operate by mid-summer,
and then gives out raises to city work-
ers like the'Parking Authority employ-
ees?

It’s timefor someone to stand up!
It’s time to stop this self-destruction
of our city! Its time for change in

‘ Pittsburgh ! —

.It’se-time for the Yinzer Party!

We’re gonna get him in Squirrel
Hill! ‘We’re gonna get him in Oakland!
We’re gonna get him Downtown!
We’re gonna get him in North Side
and East Liberty and Manchester and
Lawrenceville and South Side  the
Strip, Hazelwood, Shady Side!!!

RUUUHHHAAAAA! RRRUUU-
UUHHHHHAAAAAAAAA!!! I

Support regime change in
Pittsburgh NOW! Stop Murphy’s
weapons of mass taxation!
Vote Nick Kratsas for mayor in
2006! "

Harris, Athletics reveal new slogan, “strive to be mediocre”

J OE MARCHILENA
Normal People Hands

Change is in the air on the South
Side of Pittsburgh, and it’s not for the
better or the worse.

1 It’s to_ stay the same.
On Wednesday, Pitt football head

coach Walt Harris announced that there «

will be a change to his team’s philoso-
phy for the upcoming 2004 season.

No longer- will the team slogan be
“Commitment. Teamwork. Pride.”
Instead, Harris decided to use some-
thing that better fits the performance of
his team over the last four years.

“We’ve been to four consecutive

no-name bowls, and that’s a tremen-
dons accomplishment for our pro-
gram,” Harris said. “Since we can’t
seem to_ improve on -that, I’-ve decided
to change our team motto to
‘Commitment to Mediocrity.’ ”

The change comes. with complete
support from Pitt administration and
the athletics department.

“We support this change 100 per-
cent,”, said athletics director Jeff Long.
“Walt Harris is a tremendous coach
and a tremendous recruiter. He has
brought this program to a successful
level of mediocrity and we stand
behind him.”

In his seven years at Pitt, Harris

has ‘compiled a very mediocre record
of 44-40, including a 2-3 record in

‘bowl games. Included in that win total

is a 9-1 record against teams from the
Mid-American Conference and ‘wins
over Division I—AA schools like
Villanova and East Tennessee State,
not to mention three. consecutive wins
over an overrated Virginia Tech team.

“Year in and.year out, we usually
beat the teams that we’re supposed to,”
Harris said. “Sometimes we don’t, and
that’s probably my fault. But every
once in a while, we go out and win
tremendous football games.”

In a related story, Harris’ entire
staff has decided to leave Pitt, citing

. . \ . \ \ . . . .

the change in team philosophy as the
reason. ‘

“You play to win the games,” said
former Pitt defensive coordinator Paul
Rhoads. “Our time at Pitt has been
tremendous, but it really is time to
move on.” .

While there is no definite destina-
tion for Harris’ former coaches, it is
rumored that they will all become
coaches at Nebraska.

Harris, though, said he thinks the
changes will help Pitt accomplish its
new goal. ' ,

“Calling plays is real hard with
those guys,” he said. “Without them,
we’ll be mediocre for sure.”

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Man of Gold

Carl Krauser made it official
yesterday that he is transferring
from Pitt after his sophomore year
to go to Notre Dame — as a mascot.

Krauser has accepted the job of
official leprechaun at the University
of Notre Dame. On Feb. _7, the
Fighting Irish announced live at the
Pitt/Notre Dame game that the old

leprechaun would be retiring, come
. season’s end.

Krauser was approached after
the game about becoming the mas-
cot. Without thinking twice, he
accepted the job.

“I like the color green,” Krauser
said. “Growing up in the Bronx,
people always talked about the
green stuff, so when my chance
came to put on a green uniform I
jumped at the chance.”

The Irish held a ‘press confer-
ence this morning to officially
announce Krauser as their mascot.

.Whi1e most mascot roles and cheers

will stay the same next year in
South Bend, there will be some new
cheers Krauser intends to implement
in his first year as mascot.

“Instead of doing the leprechaun -.

march like Notre Dame has done for

Krauser leaves
Pitt to don a little,

the past century,
the Irish fans will
now put an ‘X’ sign
up every time the
opposing players
are introduced,”
Krauser said. “This
will make it
extremely intimi-
dating for opposing
teams to play in the
Joyce Center.”

This wasn’t the
only new cheer
Krauser talked
about this morning.
Instead of the nor-
mal two hands in
the air for a three-
point attempt, now
fans will make a A
big “X” with their
arms after a three-
pointer. And a free
throw. And a steal.
And a turnover.
And a timeout. And
a bad call.

Even Notre
Dame’s football helmets will have a
logo on them for the first time ever.
You guessed it, an “X”.

Krauser is looking forward to the
first time Pitt visits Notre Dame,

. which will be in football in the fall.

Pitt’s football squad hasn’t won in
South Bend, Ind., in years, and

Krauser’s heart, and .he doesn’t

expect that to change this fall.

“We will win this fall,” Krauser
said. ‘-‘Come on; it’s football. We all
know Pitt football has no chance-
against Notre Dame.”

Brown’s pending graduation, has allowed the

Brown, who was not on the All’-Big East First
Team, said that he agreed to be the subject for
the tests after “a shady man in a trench coat”
approached him last year and asked him to serve

‘his country.

“It was a real honor,” Brown said at the press
conference yesterday. “And I figure, it just
makes me harder to defend.”

Calhoun echoed sentiments about Brown’s invis-
ibility. '

“We had no information on J aron Brown, and
that made it tough to beatthem,” Calhoun said
via teleconference from San Antonio. “They
aren’t the most talented‘ team in the Big East,
just the least visible.”

U.S. President George W. Bush, also in
attendance at the press conference, gave Brown
the Medal of Honor for service to the country.

“Jerry is a real instoperation to our children,
the seeds of our fruits, and compatriatic
Americans everywhere,” Bush said. “I’m ‘sure he
will continue to be amodular American as he
services with the troops in Iraq, and then on
Mars.”

“Say what?” Brown said, before Langolier
ended the conference prematurely._

Pitt football coach Walt Harris told the press
afterward that Brown’s cloaking” was “one small
step for man, one tremendous leap for men.”
