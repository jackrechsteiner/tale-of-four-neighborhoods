Constitutional
glitch creates

SGB confusion

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN & ELIZABETH BOWEN
Contributing Editors

As Student Govemment Board President Jetf Alex and his
board attempt to get down to business this summer, a single consti-
tutional technicality looms as a possible roadblock.

Though SGB bylaws state that the new board should take
oﬂice on the ﬁnal day of classes of the spring term —— a change
brought on when students voted in October to move the election
dates —— the constitution still reads that the board takes ofﬁce on the
ﬁrst day of the winter term.

Article VIII of the constitution states that when the bylaws and
the constitution conﬂict, “the constitution shall take precedence.”

The practical result of these speciﬁcations is that in order for
Alex and the new board to ofﬁcially take oﬂice, the constitution

must be amended.

Pitt professor keeps a watchful
eye on North Pacificvolcanos

EDWARD HUMES
Staff Writer

Michael Ramsey, an assistant professor of
geology and planetary science at Pitt, spends his
days studying volcanoes and thermal ﬂuctuations
in the North Paciﬁc He does this all from his lab-
oratory at Pitt and hopes his research will some-

‘day save lives.

The trans-Paciﬁc corridor, made up, in part,
of the Aleutian Islands and the Bering Sea, boasts
the world’s most heavily used air route. Twenty-
thousand people per day make the trek across the
same path Asian natives are believed to have
used to settle North America — but today the
travelers ﬂy 30,000 feet above the ancient land
bridge.

According to Rarnseythe route is in constant
danger from the area’s volcanoes. .

“One is usually erupting at any given tirn

because there are so many up there,” he said.

When these volcanoes erupt, dust clouds
spew into the air in giant plumes.

“If a plume gets about 30,000 feet, you’re
right in the path of where 747s'ﬂy,” Ramsey said.
“It’s like pulling sand through your engines.”

The complications resulting from ﬂying
through a volcano’s plume could cause planes to
plummet into the ocean. E ’

« An early warning of the position of volcanic
plumes might give air trafﬁc controllers time to
divert trans-Paciﬁc ﬂights around these hazards,
eliminating the possibility of pilots chancing a
ﬂight through the dust clouds. ‘

But because the volcanoes’ locations are so
remote, the most efficient way to study their
activity is by satellite. - A A

Bomb scare on Fifth.
snarls rush-hour traffic

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

Rush-hour commuters were routed away from Fifth Avenue in
Oakland for more than two hours Friday aﬁemoon because of a
report of a “suspicious package” — which tinned out to contain
nothing more than porcelain.

’ According to University spokesman Ken Service, a witness
reported seeing a woman place a newspape;r—wrapped package
inside a trash can on Frﬂh Avenue across from the Masonic Temple.

inside. _

Just after 3:30 pm, city and Pitt police closed Fifth Avenue
between Lytton Avenue and Belleﬁeld Street so the bomb squad
could conduct an investigation. After X-raying the package on site,
police extended the blockade to Bigelow Boulevard, rerouting traf-
ﬁc and pedestrians. By 5:30 pm, police evacuated the.Cathedral
lawn, and the growing crowd was forced behind wide bands ofye1—
low police tape.

As news helicopters buzzed overhead, oﬂicers yelled “ﬁre in
the hole” before shooting a mixttme of carbon dioxide and water
intothepackagetobreakitopen.

Upon fmther inspection, olﬁcers learned that the package was

“We’re happy that it tumed out to be not more serious than
that,” Service said of the Friday afternoon disruption.

University spokesman
has the final word

DAVE HARTMAN A

News Editor

After serving as Pitt’s director of news
and information for seven years, Ken
Service will leave the .
University this _ week to
pursue a career at another
local college. At press time,
Pitt had yet to name his
successor.

Service came to Pitt in
1994 after serving as the
director of corporate infor— '
mation at Duquesne Light
Company. Before his
Duquesne post, he worked
in public relations posts at
universities both in
Pittsburgh and neighboring
states, including Duquesne
University and Carnegie Mellon University.

Eifective July 1, Service will begin
work as La Roche College’s vice president
for institutional relations. He has served on
the college’s board of trustees for four years.

According to Service, whose work at
Pitt has required him to provide comment on
anything from same-sex beneﬁts to the pro-
posed grassing-over of Bigelow Boulevard,
the years he spent at. Pitt have been good
ones. p .
Service said that he’s enjoyed helping

    

Ken Servi  

both the University and Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg continually improve during his
time at Pitt. And though he imagines his new
job will prove equally as challenging, it will
likely accompany fewer late-night phone
calls to his home.

“Hardly a night went by
that I didn’t get calls from the
media or someone at the
University,” Service said At
times, those calls came in the
wee hours of the moming.

In his position at La
Roche, Service will oversee
the college’s communications,
marketing, public affairs,
development and government
and community relations pro-
grams. Service said he is
excited about the opportrmity
to work with the college, and

is particularly interested in its .

worldwide outreach programs.

“While small in size, La Roche is
nonetheless having a signiﬁcant effect and
growing inﬂuence in promoting intemation-
al understanding and providing the hope of
better lives for many in developing nations
of the world,” he said

Service’s last day at Pitt is Friday, after
which time Robat Hill, Pitt’s executive
director of public aifairs, will make an
announcement regarding the vacated posi-

Sodexho hosts cookout
for Pittsburgh’s homeless

The Pitt News

Sodexho Marriott services held a cook-
out for the homeless on Friday at the
Vretnarn Veterans Pavilion in Schenley Park.
Burgers, hot dogs and plenty of entertain-
ment were all part of the day planned for
needy families in the Pittsburgh area.
Hundreds of volunteers helped to bring
together the families and the event.

The idea for the cookout originated
from the S.T.O.P. Hunger campaign that is
sponsored by the foundation Sodexho
Teams Our People. The nationwide lun-

cheons are normally held twice around the
holiday season and once during the spring.
The Pittsburgh area Spring Serve-A-'Ihon
was a success, and the volunteers wanted to
have another feast during the summer.

Everything from the food to the enter-
tainment was donated by Pitt, Wholeyfs,
Giant Eagle, Pepsi, Schwebel’s, Sister of
Moonstone and many other organizations.

“I was shocked to see how many people
participated You think at least a few people
will help and then 300 show up,” said Jodi
Ludovici, Sodexho Marriott’s marketing
manager.

. Jubilee Kitchen, St. Joseph’s House of
Hospitality, Miryam’s Women’s Shelter and
Bethlehem Haven coordinated the cookout.

Kids enjoyed face painting while all
ages played games and listened to music
spun by a local DJ throughout the day.

“I think we will be having these more
and more often,” Ludovici said “Everyone
isverysupportive,anditisgreattoseeso
many people coming together for such a
good cause.”

VOLCANO

ASTER. The 14-color imaging instru-
ment is housed on NASA’s earth-moni-
toring satellite, Terra, launched in
December 1999.

ASTER helps scientists understand
volcanic activity by creating detailed
maps of thermal phenomena, eruption
plumes, sulfur dioxidc gasses, lava
ﬂows and the historic activities of vol-
canoes.

Although ASTER is not a good
device for immediate warning, Ramsey
explained, when used in conjunction
with other tools on Terra, scientists are
able to make detailed observations of
eruptions as they occur.

These observations will allow sci-
entists like Ramsey to better understand
eruptions and warn people of pending
disasters.

As a member of the ASTER science
team and director of the Image
Visualization and Infrared
Spectroscope laboratory at Pitt,

FROM PAGE 1

Ramsey is able to analyze data about
Aleutian Island volcanic activity while
still in Oakland.

Ramsey explained that the ASTER
information is first received by NASA,
then sent to Japan where it is decoded,

I and ﬁnally delivered to his lab.

He hopes in the future data will be
sent directly to scientists in the ﬁeld,
where the information on active volca-
noes will have immediate effects.

While Ramsey has focused his
research on 22 active volcanoes in the
Aleutian Island chain, he is‘ quick to
remind people that volcanic activity
does not exist in just the Northern
Pacific.

About 500 million people world-
wide live on or near volcanoes, and
nearly 100 volcanoes erupt each year.
According to Ramsey, the budgets of
many Third World countries’ do not
allow for detection systems.

' “Our goal is to watch as many of
these volcanoes as we‘ can and give
warning to people who live close by,”
he said. .

SGB

SGB named a Constitutional Review
Committee last year, responsible for shifting
the date of elections from November to
April. But the committee neglected to
amend the constitution to reﬂect the date on
which the new board takes oﬂicc.

Changing the constitution toreﬂect the
election date involves two steps. First, the
change mustbc proposed by either a peti-
tion signed by 5 percent of the non-CGS
undergraduate“ body or a Constitutional
Review Committee, appointed by a majori-
ty of the board. Regardless of which avenue
is used to initiate a change, it must be
approved by a student referendum held dur-
ing the fall or spring term.

Last year, then-president Mike Unangst
and his board appointed a Constitutional
Review Committee, but to remain in exis-
tence to oversee another constitutional ref-
erendum, the committee must be renewed
by the current president and board.

Alex said he plans to rely on the
Constitutional Review Committee to call a
referendum to again amend the constitution.

“They’ll deﬁnitely be renewed,” he
said, although there currently is no timetable
set for such action. 0 ,

Constitutionally, Alex and the new
boardhave yet to assume the power needed
to renew the committee. '

I In May, while he was still president,
Unangst issued a three-page executive order
declaring his intention to immediately
swear Alex into olﬁce as SGB president

Unangst said this action gave Alex the
authority to renew the Constitutional
Review Committee to change the constitu-
tion.

“It was a decision between a technical-
ity and student intent [that was] measured
by a referendum election,” he said, noting

FROM PAGE 1

‘.. ,1

that a constitutional technicality should not
interfere with changing the election cycle.

Alex said he expects members of
Unangst’s board to question whether his
board has the authority to renew the com-
mittee. '

“There will be some confusion,” he
said. “I guarantee that.” He stated his inten-
tion to renew the committee, but conceded
that the friction between his board and the
last presents “an issue that needs
addressed.”

Alex said that in the meantime, he

' plans to appoint board members as liaisons

to student groups at SGB’s next training ses-
sion. At the board’s armual retreat, to be held
in late July or August, Alex said members
would begin to crack down on deadlines. ‘
Board member Kevin Washo Jr. said

the constitutional error was not preventing ,

him ﬁom working on the goals he estab-
lished during the campaign, including col-
laborating with Pitt administrators and the
athletic department to ensure effective
transportation to the new football stadium.
-“Students elected us. If we turned our
back on this, we wo11ldn’tbe doing our jo ,”
he said. “The mailboxes are even changed.
Jeff has moved into his oﬂice. We’re mov-
ing forward.” I

A SGB adviser Joyce Giangarlo stressed S
the importance of bringing the students’ will . A

— as expressed in the referendum in
October — to fruition.

“You have to go with what the students
want,” she said -

Ifthe board can’t resolve the confusion,
the Ofﬁce of Student Activities, the body

that oversees SGB, could step in But Joe‘

Cavalla, director of student activities, admit-
ted a reluctance to intervene.
“We like [the students] to have self-

govemment and do the best [they] can. '

We’d rather the organization work it out
themselves.”

Tokyo’s crow woes grow

TOKYO —— Other great cities battle
rats or pigeons. But the scourge of Tokyo is
crows. Large, black, winged bullies with a
chilling caw and a look-you—in—the-face,
beady-eyed arrogance.

The Tokyo government commissioned

extenninators to dismantle nearly 250 nests '
. throughout May, disposing of 642 chicks

and 93 eggs in the process.

The exterrninators are ordered out only
in cases of attacks on people. That still
leaves them with plenty of work; there have
been hundreds of reports of birds swooping
down on people during the spring nesting
season. Crows usually attack from behind,
kicking or pecking at the victim’s head.

“We’ve had an increase in violent
attacks. We’ve had l0to_20thathave drawn
blood,” said Kunio Momosawa, the director
of the wildlife control program in Tokyo.

Paying off the competition .
WASHINGTON — The Democrats’
takeover of the Senate will help them raise
money, but it may not translate into a sig-
niﬁcant strategic advantage because
the power shift is expected to
motivate donors to both sides.
Business will likely
increase donations to
Democrats, but that could
be offset by a surge in giv-
ing by smaller Republican
donors anxious to see the
GOP regaincontrol, accord-
ing to political strategists,
fund—raisers and academics who
study campaign donations.

McVeigh executed for Oklahoma
bombings - '

TERRE HAUTE, Ind. —At 7:14 a.m.,
watched by 10 victims here and hundreds
more ' on closed-circuit television in
Oklahoma, Timothy James McVeigh was
executed Monday by the government he
hated.

' A series of three chemical injections
coursed into his right leg, ending his life, but

leaving‘ unresolved questions some still ‘

have about the April 19, 1995, bombing.
The death toll from the 9:02 a.m.
explosion that day was 168, including 19

  
   

children. More than 500 others were
wounded — some losing limbs, others their
eyesight — when McVeigh parked a rented
Ryder trunk in front of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building and detonated the 4,800
pounds of fertilizer and fuel inside of it.

High court backs marijuana grower’s'

right to privacy

WASHINGTON — The police may
not use heat detectors and other such high-
tech devices to look inside a person’s home,
the Supreme Court ruled Monday.

In a surprisingly strong defense of the
right to privacy, the court threw out drug

evidence against an Oregon man who was.

growing marijuana plants in his house and
ruled that law enforcement agents violated

his rights by using a thermal imager on a, C

public street to spot his hothouse.

Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative
who usually supports the govemment in the
war on drugs, said spying inside a home is
a different matter. He spoke for the 5-4
majority.

“The Fourth Amendment draws a ﬁrm

line at the entrance to the house,”
he said. “That line, we think,

also bright.”
Scalia said such
surveillance constitutes
a “search and is pre-
sumptively unreason-
able without a warrant.”
- The , ruling
appears to put a‘ signiﬁ-
' cant limit on the govem-
_ ment’s use of new technologies
that can pick up sounds or images inside a
home.

Insurers must cover birth control,
federal judge rules

A federal judge ruled for the ﬁrst time
Tuesday that a company must cover contra-
ceptives in its health insurance plan because
it covers a widerange of other products and
services designed to prevent illness or pro-
mote general well-being. _ ,

The court’s ruling against Seattle—based

Bartel] Drug Co. handed a victory to

women’s groups that have argued that cov-
erage for birth—control pills, diaphragms and
other prescription contraceptives was a fum-
damental health issue,

The ruling by the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Washington fol-
lows a ﬁnding last year by the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission
that, though not legally binding, advised
employers and courts on the issue of con-
traception‘ coverage. The commission said
two employers violated federal anti-dis-
crirnination law because they provided
health insurance coverage for things such as
blood-pressure medicine and anti-irnpo—
tence drugs, but not contraception. _

About 72 percent of workers have
health plans that cover oral contraceptives,
according to a 2000 survey by the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation.

McVeigh execution coverage
simply outrageous

On Monday, the federal govern-
ment executed Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh.

You probably already knew that.
In fact, you would have to be living in
some cabin in the middle of nowhere
with no contact to the outside world to
not know this. 9

You probably also know every
minute detail about the execution, such
as how large McVeigh’s holding cell
was, the route he took walking to his
death, the color of the tile on the walls
of the death chamber and even what he
ate as his last meal.

Whenever a major story like this
occurs, media outlets race to see who
can provide the most “extensive” cov-
erage. This coverage typically includes
ﬂashy graphics and live reports from
large numbers of reporters. One station
even offered a computer simulation of
McVeigh’s ﬁnal walk

Whatever your views on capital
punishment, an execution is a major
event. The state has no power greater
than the ability to end a life. But
because of that fact, an execution is a
somber occasion, not something meant
to entertain.

An execution is not the same as
the NBA Finals, yet the two events
have received a similar style of cover-
age. One could even say the sensation-
alism resembled Fox’s infamous

The behavior of the pro-death

penalty crowds outside the prison, who
counted down the seconds to the exe-
cution and then cheered, only illustrat-
ed this all the more.

Some members of the media
could state that they covered the execu-
tion the way they did because that’s
what sells, and since the media is a
competitive business in the United
States, it must make a proﬁt. 8

Does, the American public really
want this though? Unfortunately, it
seemsthatwedo,b'ecausemanyof_us
willingly turned on our televisions.

Following the execution, family
members of McVeigh’s victims were
paraded in front of the cameras, almost
as if to show that the execution was
about “closure,” about “healing” the
society’s wounds from the bombing.

Possibly, there is a way to cover an
execution in such a manner that it will
“heal a society’s wounds.” By report-
ing on the execution the way it did, the
television media only fed into
McVeigh’s desire for attention. The
crass sensationalism offered no chance
for healing at all. It wasn’t about the
victims, it wasn’t about healing society;
it was only about proﬁt

So what did ‘the coverage of
McVeigh’s execution offer? Absolutely
nothing but sensationalist coverage of a
sombar event. ‘

But it created some good proﬁts
for the media. And apparently that’s all
that counts.

I miss my flannel andgrunge rock

“It’s tearin’ up my heart” every time I turn
on the radio these days. I can’t even twist the
dial without giving myself a pep talk ﬁrst.

“Just ignore it, it’ll go away.” But it’s
always the same, no matter what I
tell myself. There are always some
pre-pubescent 12-year—olds whining
about their long-lost love. 6

Or even worse, ﬁve 25- to-30-
year-old men painstakingly profess-
ing their undying devotion to their ﬁrst love,
some teen-age virgin, because tl1at’s where they
get their money. c

What happened to music with meaning? It
doesn’t seem to have any place on Billboard’s
charts these days. I feel like a middle—aged hip-
pie. complaining about how my kids don’t

   
 

appreciate good music. But ‘someone comparing '

the Beatles to Nirvana is a bit different than try-
ing to compare Led Zeppelin to the Backstreet

- Boys. «

While my parents weren’t exactly big fans
of gnmge rock back in the early 1990s, they‘ at
least recognize the fact that most of the lyrics are
more intelligent than Britney Spears wailing,
“You drive me crazy/I just can’tsleep/I’m so

-excited, I’m‘in too deep.”

Very deep. Moving, in fact —-— if you’re 15.
But what about the rest of us? Those of us who
managed to graduate high school might "want to
listen to slightly more intelligent lyrics. '

Sure, the boy and ' girl bands have catchy

I tunes-, but more than half of them don’t even

write them or play their own instruments. Wait,
who learns to play their own instruments these
days? That’s why we have studio musicians.

When I was only 14 or 15 myself, Ifell in

love with Nirvana. Not because other people
did, but because their music spoke to me beyond
the ramblings of some heartbroken teen-ager.
Most of their lyrics, in fact, are very simple, but
not completely familiar and deﬁnitely unique.
In “Serve the Servants,” Kurt Cobain
wrote, “I tried hard to have a father, but instead

I had a dad/I just want you to know that I" don’t ‘

hate you anymore/Ihere is nothing I could say
that I haven’t thought before.” There’s nothing
ﬂowery about these lyrics, they’re highly relat-

able and they have made many people like

DIAN
TUORTO

myself take a second look into their lives.

Anyone can relate to a lovesick teen-ager,' I
but there’s a deeper level of relation that Nirvana ,

and other bands have offered that is neglected in
' today’s popular music.

One artist who earns my
‘ respect for saying whatever is _on
his mind, whenever he feels like it,

_ I loved 10 years ago, heconnects
with people on a more intimate level by saying

anything, by taking personal and often painful

experiences and releasing them out into the

open. ’ _ ~
Some of my favorite lines comes from the

song “Criminal,” when Erninemshows what he -

thinks of religious and moral hypocrites.

He states, “Please Lord, this boy’ needs
Jesus/Heal this child, help us destroy these,
demons/Oh, and please send me a brand new

car and a prostitute while my wife’s sick in the _

hospital/Preacher preacher, ﬁfth grade teacher,
you can’t reach me, my mom can’t neither/You

,can’t teach me agoddamn thing cause I watch
_t TV and Comcast cable.” ~

Not only are Eminem’s lyrics funny and
bitingly cynical, but many people, whether they
admit to itor not, can relate to his social com-
mentary. ,

And if you don’t relate, Eminem doesn’t
care. He’s not in the industry just to sell records;

. he wants his voice to be heard At least artists

like him realize that music isa form. of free

expression, and to simply say whatever a record -
_ company is paying them to say isn’t enough to

satisfy them. . ,

Sowhile I’m not so unrealistic as to say that
boy and girl bands do not have their place in
today’s music, I wish that powerful, lyric-driven
rock music could ﬁnd some room on the charts
today for those of us over 16 and under 60.

Meanwhile, I’ll be_ wandering the streets

wearing an old ﬂannel, humming the words to l 4
Pearl Jam’s “Jeremy” as a car speeds by blast— ‘

ing, “I’m a geniein -a bottle, gotta rub me the
right way, honey.”

Diana Tuorto gets bitter every  she hears
the BackstreetBoys.

is Eminern. Like the grunge bands .

Brazilians place more emphasis on body

SAO LUIS, Brazil — Everyone has a
premature vision of what certain places in
the world must be like. Brazil often stirs up
colorful images of the Amazon and rain for-
est, pinkandgreenfruitsthatcanbeshaken
from a tree and the Carmen Miranda-like
ﬁgure of a bronzed woman with gyrating
hips.
Having been here for four weeks now,
I’d venture to say that there is some accura-
cy in each of these images.

The sensuality rooted in this culture,
ﬁorn the mixing of Aﬁican, indigenous and
European bloods and customs, is especially
noticeable in the female attire. Mindful of the
fact that the tropical climate in Sao Luis
doesn’t allow for trendy long-sleeve clothing
or anything that covers much skin, the dress
— particularly for women — is short and
tight.

My fellow Pitt colleagues and I can’t
help but notice Brazil’s emphasis on the
female bunda. — ass, heinie, back-side, butt,
booty, behind, bum, rear-end, tail, tush —
whatever name you give this cushioned part

of the body, it will surely be welcomed to
this national obsession with the

viola or guitar—shaped woman. MON] C A
FA UST

Various TV shows air dance
contests or a half-hour solo
samba routine by a dark-haired
woman in a string bikini.

Mannequins in lingerie shops bear
almost nonexistent chests and what seems to
us to be some kind of optical illusion with an
exaggerated bunda.

Some Americans ﬁnd ﬁo dental (dental
ﬂoss) bathing suits, ultra low-rise, body-
slurping shorts, skirts and pants worn by all
shapes of women particularly fascinating.
Forthisreason,thereisnosuchthingasan
eyesore on the beach. Seeing a 70-year-old
lady expose layers of her skin gets you think-
ing about how relative beauty is.

Touching is an important part of cultur-
al communication here. Pulling in with the
arms and lending checks for two kisses is
expected. Hug-tackling and two-cheek kiss-

on the shoulder to stress a
‘key point is quite all right.
In order to avoid being

The physicality of this culture offers
some luxuries of comfort I wouldn’t mind
taking back with me. My newfound appreci-
ation of the bunda would probably be very
well received here. Even more received
would be the sun and sea, that unfortunately

Out of time

No Such Place

Jim White

Luaka Bop
Playing June 16
Club Cafe .

NANCY REDDY

Staff Writer

“Nothing’s prettier than a pretty girl, dig-
ging a heart-shaped hole in the ground.”

These are the memorable opening lines to
Jim White’s‘ ‘.‘The Wrong Kind of Love,” a
song from his second album, ‘No Such Place.
White certainly does have a taste for the
bizarre, and wild imagery such as this is only
par for the course. His music is almost every-
thing but what you would expect from a musi-
cian from Pensacola, Fla., who has been com-
pared to both Nick Cave and Tom Waits.

White is the classic Southern storyteller,
always sporting his cowboy ‘hat, sideburns and
half-smile. He draws from the roots of tradi-
tional country music and instruments, such as
banjos and slide guitars, but incorporates pop
and even hip-hop beats to create a fresh sound.
His music is quirky and extremely unique.

I White’s second album, No Such Place, is
an eclectic mix of songs ranging from the
upbeat “Handcuffed to a Fence in
Mississippi” to the twangy, mellow
“Corvair.”

This album finds him doing
everything from contemplating a bro-
ken-down car, which is now just a home
for birds, to painting a strangely sympathetic
portrait of a woman who kills one husband
after another and throws them into the river,
blaming “a condition she picked up as a child
 the wound that never heals.”

Although at times he becomes a little slow
and creaky, White has more than enough
upbeat songs and dramatic tales to make up
for these lapses.

As a songwriter, White is sharp, witty and
poetic. He has a great talent for melding tru-
ism with completely surreal story lines and
images. For instance, the narrator of
“Handcuffed to a. Fence in Mississippi” who
finds himself quite literally in this situation,

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 

observes that “Freedom’s just a stupid
superstition, cause life’s a highway
that you travel blind,” all the while

insisting that “thing-s are really better than
they seem.”

This mix of aphorism, metaphor and lyri-
cal, albeit extremely strange, storytelling cre-
ate the effect of an auditory Salvador Dali
painting for the listener.

White seems like the kind of man you
could meet in a diner off the side of an inter-
state somewhere, someone you would want to
sit with and talk to all night.

His appearance at Club Cafe on June 16
affords his listeners the opportunity to do just
that, to be drawn into his ‘compelling story-
telling and rhythms.

Jim White’s world is a crazy place, and for
a night at least, we’re invited to inhabit it.

 

 

 

Me driving crazy

i are
‘ ‘ ’ '5 ing recording an album right
now, and I have gotten to listen
to pieces of it as it has been created.
I asked him the other day if they
used any samples of police sirens in
the album, and he informed me that,
no, there are no police sirens on this
album.
One of my biggest pet
peeves is listening to an album
in the car only to be surprised by
an alarming sample of emer-
gency vehicle sirens. I ﬁnd myself blindly steering thecar
while staring over my shoulder or into the rearview mirror
and scanning the disappearing black highway for glimpses
of ﬂashing red and blue lights.
I have been looking over my shoulder a lot lately, and
not just because I have been listening to a symphony of

My boyfriend’s band is finish-

sirens, but because I was actually pulled over for speeding ’

a couple of weeks ago. ..

While returning to my parents’ home in the suburb
after seeing a show in Pittsburgh, I hit 80 mph in a 65 zone
while accelerating down a hill.

The road was completely dark, but I saw a pair of lights
at the side of the highway.

I thought, “How strange. Maybe it’s a police car.”

Although I slowed to the speed limit, my heart rate dou-
bled as the car whipped onto the highway.

‘It followed me until I thought it wasn’t a police car and
then it ﬂipped on its lights. My heart rate doubled again.

When I dutifully pulled over to the side of the highway,
I turned off my mixed tape of falsely cheerful British bands
and silence ﬂooded the car. The policeman knocked on my
window and I handed him my license and registration.

This was the first time I had ever been pulled over, and
I had only ever been in another car that had been pulled
over once. That driver hadn’t received a ticket. As I sat there
in silence, I said to myself, I don ’t have any other driving
violations, and heck, I ’m a good kid; he won ’t give me a
ticket.

After an extended period of time, however, which I con-
cluded the policeman was not using for soul-searching, I
realized that I was going to get My First Speeding Ticket.

I imagined a hypothetical scene where I played the fem-
inine stereotype, releasing a waterfall of tears, convincing
the solid—looking man in uniform to give me only a warn-
ing. . .

But alas, tears would not arrive.

Instead, my hand merely shook as he handed me the
thin yellow paper ticket and I swallowed diyly, took the
ticket and drove home in a jumpy daze.

"Of course, I drove below the speed limit all the way
home, glancing over my shoulder every so often.

I remarked to myself how ironic it was that .despite the
fact that I was speeding to return home quickly, the trip took
much longer and was much more costly because I had sped.

Because of the trauma of that night’s experience, I
vowed I would never speed again. ' ~

Until I got pulled over the next day.

. Senior Staff Writer

In a fit of classic? sitcom-like
coincidence and chance for bond-
ing, my stepfather and I drove six
and a half hours to Red Bank, N.J.,
to see America and Al Stewart per-
form. And then we drove back.

I learned of both musical acts
through my stepfather, who had
made mix tapes of both before he
sold his record collection. I had
been listening to his America tape
since I was 2 and he wasn’t even my
stepfather yet. I began listening to
his Al Stewart tapes last year.

So on Thursday afternoon,
armed with cheese sandwiches and
more tapes from the featured musi-
cians, we hopped in his red
Maxima.

And, after promising my mother
that we'd call when we arrived, we
took off.

Six hours, two wrong turns and
directions from one non-English-
speaking gas station owner later, we
ran into Red Bank’s Count Basie
Theater only 10 minutes late.

The ticket lady thought that we
were absurd for having traveled so
far, but running into the thick- dark
of the concert hall and seeing
Stewart in the spotlight playing the
most gorgeous melody on his
guitar was reward enough
for our journey.

Our eyes were barely
adjusted and we couldn’t
find_our seats, so we merely
stood in the aisle watching him. He
moved closer to the microphone 
The fishing boats go out across the
evening waters ...” he sang.

The theater erupted in applause.

By the time he finished “On the
Border” an usher decided we were
blocking the entrance, and showed
us to our seats. Stewart talked about
coming to America for the first time
in the late-’60s, and how the first
greeting he received was from a
New York cabbie who said, “You
British? I hate the f—-ing British.”

He said that he met a girl from
Pittsburgh who let him stay on her
couch for 10 days and then she told
him he had to leave. About the time
the girl from Pittsburgh was trying

to get him to leave, Paul Simon
called the house and asked for him.

The girl from Pittsburgh was
shivering with excitement, “You
know Paul Simon?” she said.

Stewart shared a ﬂat for several
months with Simon when Simon
and Garfunkel were in London. He
finally got a place of his own and he
wrote “In Brooklyn” to commemo-
rate the 10 days he spent with the
girl from Pittsburgh. _ V

Then he played some riffs, and
explained the fundamentals of
country-western songs. He, per-
formed a song called “League of
Notions” which he claimed is “the
only country-western song ever
about the Treaty of
Versailles.”

“He is so coo1!” was all I could
say. '
‘He played a beautiful rendition
of his “Roads to Moscow,” and then
ended his guest appearance with the
mandatory “Year of the Cat,” only
he asked us to sing the chorus for
him. When he left, everyonefelt far
from quenched. '

It was the best performance I’ve
ever seen. ‘

Then America came out.

Like I said, I have been listen-

ing to America since I was 2, when '

I would dance around the one-level

house we had in Dallas singing,

“You can do magic!” and

_ “Won’t you be my woman

- tonight!” i

‘  When America began

the Red Bank rendition of

their 3-0-year tour, I was treated

to “Riverside,” and my favorite,

“Ventura Highway.” When they

played, “You Can Do Magic.” I

finally got to hear a sound biteil
missed all those years.

When I was about 4 or 5 I acci-
dentally erased about five or six
seconds of the song from the mix
tape. I never heard the lyrics until
now. My version always went, “And
when the wind is beating upon the
window pane, and when the ni-
(sounds of me fumbling with the
tape) here, who would believe it.”

They played everything.

An hour later when they
wrapped up the show with “Sister
Golden Hair,” groups of 30- and-
40—somethings were dancing down

the aisles and cheering. As a teen

After suffering through abysmal
summer blockbusters during the last
few years, I fondly recall a time when
big, dumb action movies didn’t take
themselves too seriously. Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and
the days of carefree —- though violent
—— fun action ﬂicks complete with pre-
dictable one-liners began to fade around
the beginning of the ‘90s.

Today’s big, dumb action film is’

se1f—conscious in a different way, and
now comes complete with a constant
stream of past ﬁlm and pop-culture ref-
erences. The action genre as a whole
has become mean—spirited and self-
important, as if each ﬁlm assumes it is
more than just a junk action ﬂick.

' It pretends it didn’t get the green
light on the promise of things like, say,
a topless Halle Berry. That ’ said,
“Swordfish” is a joyless, pulseless

enough of? the “Phenomenon” and
“Michael” angel motif.

For his latest scheme, Gabriel hires
ex-con computer hacker Stanley Jobson
(Hugh Jackman, “X—Men”). Nowadays,
Stanley is a good-natured, shirtless
golfing kind of guy, but could use the
money to retain lawyers good
enough to gain him his
daughter’s custody from
his pom-star ex-wife. But
other than scenes featuring
8—year—olds on cell phones,
that’s irrelevant. Because,
again, this is a big, dumb action movie.

Actually, for all the trumped—up
computerspeak thrown about in
“Swordfish,” the only hacking that
seems apparent is in the filmmaking.

Dominic Sena directs his second
summer movie after last year’s “Gone
In 60 Seconds,” employing virtually the
same stock of characters he did last
time around only with different actors.
That means the use of Travolta, who’s
quickly building a bad-movie resume to
rival that of “60 Seconds”’ Nicolas
Cage.

But as for Sena’s direction, he has a
few problems with making a movie like
this as slick as it should be. He espe-
cially has trouble performing tasks like

There’s really not much to say

Even the thrill of watching things

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Last week, Pitt head football
coach Walt Harris announced that he
suspended junior offensive tackle
Khiawatha Downey for the 2001 sea-
son for violation of team policy.

The recent news comes as a big
blow because Downey was one Lof
just six starters returning to t is
year’s offense. Downey started” on
Pitt’s offensive line for the last two
seasons.

The redshirt junior has one year
of eligibility remaining. Downey’s
been attending summer classes and
lifting weights with teammates. But
Downey will no longer be allowed to
participate in any team activities,
including workouts.

The loss of Downey immediately
makes summer camp more interest-
ing. Downey was an important part

of the team in each of the last two
seasons. He played in all 11 games in
1999 at the left guard position and
played a vitalrole at the right tackle
position during the 2000 season JM.
San Francisco - 49er Kevan
Barlow once ran behind Downey en
route to a 1,000-yard season.
Downey also aided the Panthers’
nationally ranked passing attack.
Last year when Downey went
down with an ankle injury, freshman
Matt Morgan stepped in and held his
own, starting the first five games of
the season. It was thought that
Morgan, now a sophomore, would
take over Mark Browne’s left tackle
position, making Downey and him
solid bookends of the offensive line
Now it looks as though Morgan
will step in for Downey and that
there will be a lot of competition for
the left tackle spot.
Redshirt junior Joe Manganello
is definitely a candidate for the job.

Do-y    

 Of_fensive tackle suspended for one year

Manganello played in three games
last season against Bowling Green,
Boston College and Miami. Redshirt
freshmen Saul Freund and Mark
Caldwell might also get looks. _
Pitt did recruit two big offensive
tackles this year. Jason.Capizzi (6
feet 9 inches tall, -265 pounds) and
Dale Williams (6 feet five inches tall,

290 pounds) will both get chances to

show off their skills. Williams led
Cathedral Prep to the Pennsylvania
Class AAAA Championship, and
Capizzi was a Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette All-WPIAL selection.

The suspension of Downey raises
a lot of questions about the offense.
Downey and returning starters Jon
Schall and Bryan'Anderson were
going to be the heart of Pitt’s offen-
sive line. _

Sophomores Lousaka Polite and
Dustin Picciotti’ are the only two
returning running backs with any

_ COURSY Prrr ATHLETICS-
Khiawatha Downey _
Postell will get plenty of repetitions

during summer camp, and Mike
Jemi-son, who heads Pitt’s seven

recruits that make up the 2001 class,

will also get a chance to earn playing
time. " ' '

With camp just .two months
away, the 2001 season is already
accumulating question marks. The
offensive line lost one of its anchors,
and the running back depth chart is
far from solidified. V

collegiate experience. Malcolm

Wow! Sammy Sosa just hit a touchdown

My older sister lacks a sweet tooth. In theory,
she can appreciate the tastiness and ascetic value of
treats like butter pecan ice cream and chocolate
peanut butter pie. But when dessert time rolls around
after lunches and dinners at our house,
she just can’t seem to get excited about
the imminent sweets.

Essentially, this is a metaphor for
how I feel about sports.

I am glad that sports exist. From football
to basketball to hockey to the more obscure
games and -forms of athletic competition, I
have witnessed how merely watching
sports has infused great joy into the lives
of many of my friends.

Sports — on professional, collegiate
and local levels — undoubtedly make
many people happy, generate immense
amounts of money and provide people
with heroes.

But learning to partake of sports-generated joy
has been a personal, lifelong struggle for me.

When Pitt played Penn State last fall, I wanted to
be a football fan so badly. The spirit of rivalry and
excitement that overtook the campus in the days pre-
ceding the game was incredibly contagious, to the
extent that I was inspired to purchase season tickets.

  
   
   
 

On game’ day, I woke up practically bursting
with Panther pride. I borrowed a vintage Sugar Bowl
T-shirt from my roommate and prepared mentally for
an afternoon of athletic bliss.

Before the game, I chatted excitedly with
fellow fans on the shuttle bus. After the
game, I yelled and cheered and hugged
other people in the stands.

But the game itself. was no different
from my previous unsuccessful forays into
the mystical world of football. I did not
understand what was going on; I was com-

pletely unable‘ to make intelligent com-
ments and was thus reduced to uttering
bashful “wooooooooo” and “yeaaaaah”
noises at moments I could only hope
were appropriate.

student worth his or her salt, but that did
not change the fact that I was, and still am, utterly
clueless and apathetic about the actual sport of foot-
ball.

After Penn State I basically gave up on the world
of sports. It was only on a recent Midwestern journey
that I remembered the one thing that could save me
from a life of absolute athletic dispassion: the
Chicago Cubs. '

I hate Penn State as much as any Pitt ’

My family used to live in.a small Illinois town
about two hours from Chicago, and my childhood
memories are speckled with happy recollections of
venturing to the city to cheer on the Cubs at Wrigley
Field. The White Sox were never an option; we have
always been a Cubs family.

Perhaps it is simple geographic loyalty, or maybe
it is their perennial underdog appeal, but I have

maintained a lifelong affection for the Cubs. They '

are the only professional sports team for which I
have a genuine emotional investment. A

While visiting my grandparents in the Chicago

suburb of Joliet last weekend, I had the good fortune

of catching part of Chicago’s own backyard brawl on ~

television. It was my baseball-savvy grandmother
who ‘informed me that the Cubs were taking on the
evil Sox at Corniskey Park for three games of inter-
league play, beginning last Friday.

My dad, grandmother and I gathered around the
television to watch the first game. I rooted for my
team and actually paid rapt attention, even managing
to make a little low-tech sports talk with the family
elders. My grandma hadmade an apple pie, which I
sampled during commercials, and I was ﬁlled with a
very delicious sense of feeling consummately
