THE PITT NEWS

The best of journeys

Every day for two weeks, I strode
gleefully past my Pitt News mailbox,
extracting a heaping pile of best of bal-
lots. I glanced over them to take prelimi-
nary stock of the leaders in each catego-
ry. I silently thanked the students who

voted for The Pitt News as the best free ‘
thing Pitt offers. I laughed out loud at

other entries - like the ones
you’ll find beside this col-
umn. I began piling them all
in my office.

And I forgot about
them. And the pile grew and
grew, and ﬁnally the day of
ballot reckoning came. _

We officially closed the

 

porting their brotherhood as

 

polls Nov. 2 at 5 p.m. — just Shannon months, I’d probably offer
after Phi Kappa Theta deliv- McLaughlin all of my worldly goods to
ered a box full of entries sup— Editor in Chief be awake and counting votes

remaining uncounted votes, we were all
ready to begin a new Pitt tradition — bum-
ing best of ballots.

We thought better of it, and as I fell
asleep on the couch in theofﬁce, I was
comforted by the fact that at least one

student was getting some joy out of the '

contest — Danielle Porreca. It was her

- ' name ‘I pulled randomly
from the pile —, she was the
lucky winner of a trip for two
on Pitt Program Council’s
spring break journey to
Florida. But I thought better
of my bitterness too, realiz-
ing that after graduation in
just less than half a dozen

in the wee small hours of the

best fraternity and member Lonny Fish
as best SGB member.

Then we had to begin counting.

At first this was an entertaining
proposition. Who wouldn’t want to know
what students thought was the best way
to confuse aifreshman? Would Mindy
Peskie really win for best celebrity? I
couldn’t wait to see if the rest of the stu-
dent body agreed with me that the best
Pitt tradition was chanting along to
“Penn State sucks!”

But by 4 a.m., with hundreds of

morning with this same group of people.

So thanks to the tireless efforts of an
often-underappreciated staff spanning
the editorial, business and professional
divide, votes were compiled and winners
tabulated. We present them now to you,
with all of the requisite kudos. And kudos
as well to our fabulous electorate, partic-
ularly those of you who were creative
enough to keep us awake and‘ laughing
while counting votes.

Danielle, enjoy your trip. I enjoyed
mine.

square inches of skin on‘the body, how is a
student to decide which body part to get '

Walking around campus, it’s hard not to

Of all the potential spots, the navel has
triumphed as the top place to pierce, and the

that contributes to their popularity — after '

requires a certain type of clothing, or the lack
thereof. 0 ' '

It’s OK. Let yourself be lulled to sleep
by the sweet sounds of a trained meteorolo-
gist quoting barometric pressure and tem-
perature readings over your cell phone. You
can dial (412) 936-1212 — or’ any other
number in the local Pittsburgh area —'— and
listen to your heart’s content, or until your
battery runs out, for that matter. .

-Unlike many other cell phone company

one monthly fee for  calling with-

CVS  

3440 Forbes Ave.-

D With aisles wide enough for two ,
carts to pass and a selection of products

ranging from condoms to coloring
books, CVS has a loyal following
among Pitt students.

Located slightly past Forbes Hall,
CVS is a bit of a hike from campus —
especially considering that both Eckerd
and Rite Aid are located on Atwood
Street — but students are willing to
make the trek.

The decor is simple and quiet; gray
rugs cover the ﬂoors and red and white
displays draw the eye to various prod-
ucts. But the real draw of CVS are the
aisles of groceries in the back of th
store. - ‘

Long ago South Oakland had a gro-
cery store, but since its demise students
have had to travel to ‘North Oakland or
Squirrel Hill to purchase products such
as macaroni and cheese and Ramen
noodles. With the opening of CVS a
new option was born, and crowds of
Pitt students have ﬂocked there since.

Crimes of  
Fashion

4628 Forbes Ave.

Aside from turning your dirty
clothes inside out, the best solution to
putting off the laundry is simply buying
more threads. Crimes of Fashion, a vin-
tage store, provides a funky, stylish and
inexpensive avenue for accomplishing
this. '

Stroll past the shop on any after-
noon and scan the choice picks of the
day, which the owner hangs on the
fence by the entrance. Need an orange
plaid jumpsuit? A beaded mohair
sweater? How about an oversized army
jacket? If you’re lucky, a rack of “spe-
cial” sale items hangs outside, too.

Inside, the close, warm, dry scent of
wool, cigarettes and perfume particular
to old clothes permeates the air. College
students can be found crowding the nar-

7-Eleven  

(412) 682-6108

Whether you call it “The Sev,” the
“Seven-E,” or more simply “that place with
the Slurpees,” 7—Eleven is the nurturing’
caregiver for Pitt students with late—night
needs. 0 _

Be it a midnight beef jerky attack or a
4:30 a.m. emergency need for Pepto-
Bismol, you can always count on 7-Eleven

to be there when the family doctor or your '

morn isn’t. _

At any hour of the night, you’re bound
to run into other night owls seeking to satis-
fy their Twinkie craving. Sometimes, it
seems that the store rivals the now—deﬁmct
Stratus nightclub for over-occupancy haz-

ards. This little convenience haven also has

TV dinners, noodle cups, cappuccino
machines and to the delight of sugar junkies
everywhere, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.

- The name may be 7-Eleven, but in Pitt
students’ minds, it’s No. 1. '

SIl0I'IS team  
Steelers

There’s no denying that Sundays in the
‘Burgh are dedicated to one thing: Steelers
football.

Football season is always an important

time in the Steel City, but there is something
to cheer about this season as the Steelers are
oﬂ’ to a great start and have fans wondering
about that elusive thing called the playolfs.
Tickets to brand new Heinz Field are
hard to come by, but that doesn’t stop crazy
fans from tailgating at all hours of the mom-

. ing in anticipation of another black and gold

victory. .
The Steelers are led by head coach Bill
Cowher and prominent players" such as

- Jerome Bettis, affectionately known as The

Bus, and Kordell Stewart.

And so, the question on everyone’s
mind this season — will the Steelers retum
to the glory days of the ‘70s, or will they be
watching the playoffs from home?

—Karen Bielak, assistant sports editor

BIIS route  
54c  

. Ifyou were stuck on a desert island and ‘

could only take one bus route with you,
which one would you choose?

The 500 travels Downtown and to the
North Side, the 61C runs 24 hours a day and
goes through the neighborhood of Squirrel
Hill and the 71C travels to the quaint shops
in Shadyside. It’s a tough choice.

But aside from the fact that if you were
stuck on a desert island, a bus route would
be totally irrelevant, you would probably
choose the 54C. _

This nifty route travels through a gamut
of Pittsburgh’s coolest» neighborhoods: the
South Side, the North Side, Bloomﬁeld and
the Strip District, as well as Oakland. And it
now runs 24 hours a day.

And it’s free, too!

Don’t forget the interesting characters
you’re sure to encounter on the 'bus as well.
The more neighborhoods a bus route travels
through, the more unique individuals you
see on the bus. Not to mention if you’re on
the bus in the wee hours of the morning, you
will meet all kinds of people. ‘

Shadyside

Located just north of campus,
Shadyside is a relatively upscale,
eclectic neighborhood. Although
generally pricier than South Oakland,
many students who live there believe
it is worth the extra cost. The houses
and apartments tend to be in better
shape, and the neighborhood itself is
more quiet and residential. It is also a
great place to take a walk, especially
along Devonshire Street, Bayard
Street and Ellsworth Avenue.

And then there’s Walnut Street.
The brick sidewalks of this store-
packed street have trees at the curbs,
and even if you can’t afford anything
in the more expensive places, win-
dow—shopping is _still fun. The block
is also dotted with a mix of restau-
rants offering different cuisines rang-
ing from American to Thai to French
to Chinese to Mexican. Ellsworth
Avenue past its 5700 block also has
an intriguing blend of bars and
shops.

—David McKenzie, perspectives editor

Sombrero Man  

As voted by you, our readers, the
strangest thing in Oakland is our beloved
Sombrero Man. Did I say beloved?‘

, There is nothing more delightful than
walking down Forbes Avenue and hearing
the little old man slurring, “Spare some
change-change?” or another one of his
trademark lines, D “Got any change-
change?” .

So what if he doesn’t strum a guitar or
tap dance or paint or do anything remotely
talented? He’s got a kick-ass sombrero hat
and if you’re lucky, sometimes you’ll spot
him shaking maracas. '

Sombrero Man is always well—dressed
and he keeps his look rugged for the ladies,
as he seems to strategically shave about
once every four days.

The strangest thing about him is that he
is a traveling panhandler. I saw him on the
West Virginia University campus last: year.

Lots of UPMC Presbyterian employ-

even though the service is a little slow on
weekdays at lunchtime .— only two wait-
resses cover the 15 tables in the dining
room — the portions are big and the food
is tasty.

The menu includes traditional Middle
Eastern dishes like hummus, falafel and
shish kabobs. The pars1ey—intense tab-
bouleh is a standout. If you aren’t feeling
particularly adventurous, or you just need
to get your cholesterol ﬁx, cheese steaks
and burgers are on the menu too.

If you’re hungry and alone, that’s OK
— you may ﬁnd yourself dining alone

THE P1TT—NEws

Roughly 45 Mexican food fans at a
time can’t be wrong. - -

' That’s because there’s only about 45
seats inside Mad Mex, the delicious,
cramped, incredibly loud, venerable,
Mexican restaurant — nay, Pitt tradition -
on Atwood Street. And with good reason ——
the food is may delicioso.

If any other restaurant were as dark,
loud and cramped as Mad Mex is, they’d
never have any business. But those who fre-
quent Mad Mex — trendy people and cash-
strapped college students — love the chic,
dark restaurant, with its curvy copper bar
and throbbing sound system.

Meat eaters and vegetarians alike (veg-

’ ans, too) can enjoy Mad Mex’s dishes,

which range from traditional burritos and
giant plates of nachos to toﬁi enchiladas
made with soy cheese. Almost everything
on the extensive menu is half price after 11
p.m. And everybody can enjoy the fresh,
chunky guacamole.

Another factor that makes Mad Mex
popular with the Pitt crowd (ﬂie over—21-
year-old Pitt crowd, of course) is the happy
hour drink special ~—-— all the margaritas are
half-price from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday through
Friday. After a few of the enormous, tasty
margaritas, you’ll ﬁnally ﬁgure out what the
hell that blinking sign in the window is.

Viva los nachos.

Lulu’s Noodles

The‘ simple factis that if you go to

i Pitt and have never eaten at Lulu’s, there

is something very, very wrong with you.
Lulu’_s has always been the premier alter-
native for Pitt kids who want Asian food

that is a cut above greasy dining hall egg
rolls. Every night, college students who
know jam the Craig Street restaurant _and
eat huge bowls of impeccable noodle cui-
sine. .

Lulu’s doesn’t serve just Chinese
food; their menu also contains dishes
from Thailand and other Southeast Asian
countries. Everything they serve is good —
big chunky veggies, hot spices, peanuts,
cilantro. and fantastic noodles. A menu
with a description of each dish helps you

toorder something you’ll love instead of
something you’ll poke at. pp
These cold autumn nights are an

‘especially good time to head to Lulu’s.

Bliss is walking six‘ blocks in chilly air
with your jacket wrapped around you,
then barging through the doors and scarf-
ing a big fat bowl of steaming Dr. Pho’s
Special.’ Be sure to look at the bizarre pic-
tures of half—naked people covered in
noodles adorning the walls. Between
well—priced yet really good food and the
noodle fetish, there is truly something
here for everyone. I

If your idea of Italian eats is the
stuffed shells at Schenley Cafe,
here’re two things you should
know: That’s sad and you need to
get yo’ ass to Joe Mama’s immedi-
ately.

The readers’ pick for the best"

Italian food is a restaurant that

looks less like a fine eatery and i

more like a roadside diner. But
looks can be deceiving, as Joe
Mama’s pr-oves.

The interior is decorated with
pictures of’ world—famous people
next to photos of some of Joe’s
loyal Pitt students and customers.
Where else can you see Frank
Sinatra next to that girl in your
organic biologyclass?

Candles light_ the tables, big
band music plays in the background
and cans of roasted peppers stretch
as far as the eye can see. The place
has a great ambiance and .an
authentic Italian feel —- this ain’t
no Olive Garden. '

The staff is friendly, the mood
is relaxed and the food is unbeliev-
able. From pastas to pizzas to
herbed chicken sandwiches, they’re
all Italian eats, with a touch of
American flair.

For those of you who can drink
legally, the classic Peroni beer is a
great pick and if a brew-dog isn’t
your drink of choice, they have an
extensive wine list. Water and soda
is available too for the kiddies.

Any way you slice it — get it?

. ‘they serve pizza — Joe Mama’s has

the best Italian food in Oakland. '

slightly from the previous $4.06 (tax

a cold January night or a lazy drunk-

Amid a variety of places offering

one of few Oakland restaurants that caters
to people’s breakfast needs. The long lines
of hungry patrons awaiting meals on

reasonable prices and, of course, the food. A

The restaurant is open seven days a week
from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and breakfast is
served all day — a great asset for those
who are not early risers. ’ .

Meals range from the traditional eggs,
lyonnaise potatoes and toast at $3.25 a
plate ‘ to 'a spinach and feta omelette at
$5.25. Pamela’s is also famous for its hot-'
cakes, which are served in a variety of ﬂa-
vors including chocolate chip—banana,
strawberries and cream and spiced apples
and nuts, at $5.25 a serving.

Another appealing aspect of Parne1a’s '

is that it accepts Pitt ftmds and allows cus-
tomers to call ahead for take-outs. It also
offers a 10 percent discount to all students
who present their 12th Man Club discount

  CeIica—  
  Thelnside Story

On the outside, it's easy to see that Celica‘ is race—track
inspired. But the real excitement is onthe inside..-under the
hood -' Take the Celica GT—S...Toyota worked with Yamaha to
build a 180 HP engine redlined at 7800 RPIv\...equipped it
with "Variable Valve Timing with inte||igence...a computer
that constantly monitors"and retunes your engine for maxi-
mum performance...a cam with tvvo sets of lobes to provide
two ranges of valve lift and duration for more usable horse-
power. There’s~direct ignition for greater reliability...
iridium—tipped spark plugs for reduced maintenance...a
stainless steel exhaust manifold---a water—cooled oil cooler. .
And mated with Toyota's 4—speed electronically—control|ed ,
automatic ”Sportshift”, you get transmission shift switches
on the steering wheel...just like Formula 1 race cars. Sweet.

  www.gettoyota.com

Driving a new Toyota is easier than ever —
because now your Toyota dealer has a special college graduate

financing program available thru Toyota Financial Services

So if you're within 4 months of graduation... or if you graduated
within the past two years...See your Toyota dealer for details.

      
 

that offers a lot of great advantages.

Tavern

4632 Centre Ave.
. (412) 682-9530

With several drinking establish-
ments vanishing from our campus over
the last few. years, Mitchell’s is a bar
that remains a ﬁxture.

If you want to sit down at a bar and ‘

not worry about a sorority girl vomiting
on you or having to wrestle your way to
the bar itself, Mitchell’s is a great place
to be.

Located on Centre Avenue,
Mitchell’s Tavern brings together an
eclectic group of people who make for a
pleasant and diverse atmosphere.‘

With great specials every night,
Mitchell’s is .a real lifesaver during this
time of recession. Among the special
highlights are $3 pitchers of Yuengling
and karaoke on.Wednesdays and $3.50
pitchers of Ki1lian’s on Thursdays.

Mitchell’s also attracts original
local bands on Thursdays, and it’s a
great place for pregame on Saturdays
with $1 Kamikaze shots.

All specials run from 10 p.m. to
midnight, so next time you want to
watch Monday Night Football and drink
$1 Rolling Rocks — or if you just want
to get sloppy and sing your ass off —
head to Mitchell’s Tavern.

  Mike Niemiec

If you’re over 21 and it’s beer (or
another tasty alcoholic treat) you want,
then “big” Mike Niemiec is the man to

- talk to. This former Somerset, Pa., resi- A

North Oakland. Praised by his patrons
as being kind, courteous, funny and

hard-working, big Mike ‘is one of the 
main ‘reasons many students go "to.

Mitchell’s. '

Having worked at Mitchell’s for
more than a year, Niemiec’s job
description is bartender, bouncer and
overall friend of customers and work-
ers. In addition, the University can be
honored by the fact that this year’s best
local bartender is also a Pitt student.

Mad Mex

370 Atwood St.

(412 681 -5656,

- If you haven’t been to a Mad Mex
happy hour, you’re just wasting your time,
because it’s a must on this campus.

According to any bartender there, each
margarita is spiced with 4 1/2 shots of tequi-
la. The happy hour lasts from 4 to 6 p.m., but
if you want a good seat, you’d better get
there a little early.

Included in the experience is free chips
and salsa, and a margarita for a little under
$5 —— about half off the usual price. Any bar-
tender will tell you that the original frozen
margarita has the most alcohol in it but you
can also choose from margaritas on the
rocks, and frozen strawberry or kiwi mar-
garitas.

Intoxication obviously varies with body
weight but for me, one margarita equals
“that was good, let’s get another one.” Two
equals, “I’m feeling decent (on deﬁnite
verge of being wasted), let’s go for three.”
After the third one comes irrational yet fun
behavior, and if you’re a nut and dare to
have four, then you have oﬁicially ended
your evening at 6 p.m.

——Kenneth Paul, sports editor

Ice cream  
Dave & Andy’s.

207 Atwood St.
(412) 681-9906

Homemade wafﬂe cones, stuffed
with mouth-watering homemade ice
 cream, ought to be enough to massage
your frozen dairy fetish. Let’s not for-
‘ get about the best part of the luscious
combination — the M&M wedged at
the bottom of the cone, preventing the
sugary treat from staining your

t Abercrombie & Fitch garb.

Where can all of this happen? At no
other than Oakland’s finest, Dave &
Andy’s, your ice cream dreams can
come true. They’ve got exotic ﬂavors
and jimmies to satisfy each one of your
taste buds. The sweet scent of the waf-
ﬂe cones in the place will surely dis-
tract you from deciding on which con-
fection you want most.

So treat your tongue ———_ stop by

. Dave & Andy’s and find that M&M.
They have milkshakes, too.

Wings
The Wing Pitt

424 Semplel St.
412) 581-3713

For the second straight year, The Wing
P'tt is tops for wings with Pitt students.
And it certainly deserves the distinction,
although one has to doubt whether voters
were swayed by its name. The Wing Pitt
serves a wide variety of wings, each dis-
tinctive and delicious.

After sampling six different, delec-

table ﬂavors, teriyaki emerged as a person-
al favorite, although their basic, traditional
hot wings are also excellent —— the key to
any good wing place. And if their sauces

» are too hot for you, they’ graciously provide

a generous amount of cucumbers to cool
off your mouth, in an innovative and suc-
cessful departure from the classic celery
formula.

Sure, Quaker Steak and Lube has an
all-you—can-eat special once a week, but
The Wing Pitt is withiniwalking distance,
the prices are reasonable and the counter-
top atmosphere is intimate and friendly.
Plus, with free delivery, The Wing Pitt is
sure to satisfy the cravings of any broke,
hungry, carnivorous college student. .

women’s basketball games, graduation
ceremonies and special events, in addi-

anyone who happens to pass by. The

giving Pitt the opportunity to host larg-

for a more exciting experience.

Even ‘though some were not happy
about the decision to demolish Pitt

The Ashtray

Lung cancer, schmung cancer.

Whether it’s menthol or non-men-
thol, 100s or 120s, lights or full ﬂavor,
nothing says lovin’ like a sweet, sweet
drag of smoke. Like the U.S. Postal
Service, these nicotine ﬁends brave
sleet, snow and’ rain for the soothing
pleasure of a cigarette.

The Ashtray, as it’s endearingly
called, is the patio outside of the
Towers_lobby. While enjoying their
Marlboros and Camels, chain puffers
can watch fellow students scurry to
class, laugh at people trying to cross

Forbes Avenue and meet people who
share a similar vice.

The non-smoker walking through
the Ashtray may spot ﬁrst—thing—in—the-
morning smokers stumbling around in
their jamnries, grumbling and irritable
until ‘they quell their morning jitters.
After—sex smokers can be seen with
their clothes on inside—out and hair
disheveled, lighting a square with shak-
ing hands. It’s enough to send a
reformed smoker dashing to 7-Eleven.

" To make sure the Ashtray will
always live‘ up to its name, smokers

must resist pressure to quit their dirty, ‘

delightful little ﬁxation. And if you’re
among the quitters, it’s never too late to
start again.

Atwood. Street

Nestled in South Oakland and home to
some of the neighborhood’s most high—pro-
ﬁle restaurants, Atwood Street is the best off-
campus street.

A tour of Atwood Street begins at Fifth
Avenue near Children’s Hospital. Between
Fifth and Forbes avenues is the University
Beverage Center, which in addition to sell-
ing beer displays many of the fake IDS con-
ﬁscated by proprietors over the years.

The stretch ﬁom Forbes Avenue to
Sennott Street includes not one but two

. drugstores, a Starbucks, a liquor store and a (

bar. Just on the other side of Sennott Street is

Holiday Inn Select

 University Center

100 Lytton Ave.
(412) 682-6200

The Holiday Inn Select is nestled away
on Lytton Avenue in North Oakland, near
Clapp Hall. Though the hotel is only two
stories high and does not usually have an
abundance of vacant rooms, it makes up for
in quality what it lacks in quantity. 1

The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff are
friendly and almost over—accommodating,

and the meals are killer for a hotel restaurant. t

Also, your parents will surely admire you

for selecting a hotel in such_a prime location _

— convenient, but in one of the more scenic,
better-smelling parts of Oakland.

—-Brandon Waloﬁf assistant photo editor

The Ashtray» 

To some it’s a place to smoke. To oth- V

ers, it’s simply a. walkway connecting
Schenley Quad to the bridge over Forbes

Avenue. To most, though, the Ashtray is ren—  ' If

dezvous central. .
Ifyou are one of the masses living in the.

Quad, whether you’re looking to burn a cig- ,
arette or just to hang out with friends, i P’

chances are you’ll head to the Ashtray. On
any given weekend night, mobs of students
dressed to be seen congregate on the cement
in -search of tips on places to party. .

And as any Quad resident knows,‘ peo-

3812 University Drive

Last spring, the brothers at Phi Kappa
Theta hauled in 11 tons of sand for their
annual luau. They completed the theme
by planting palm trees and building a tiki
hut on the dance ﬂoor of the fraternity
house.

And surely, more than a few pairs of

couples surrendered themselves to the
hookup—inducing vibes of a Phi Kappa
Theta party. "

The thought and plamiing that goes
into Phi Kaps’ parties is what makes their
house the best place to hook up. And it’s
not just the luau either. The brothers host
theme parties sporadically throughout the
year, including one on Halloween where
everyone dresses up. i

Parties routinely ﬁll to capacity ——
500 attended last year’s luau '— and
brothers often have to turn away latecom—
ers at the door. The dance beat is loud and
insistent; partiers dance almost without
intending to as the beat creeps into their
bones. . .and their hearts palpitate with the
prospect of some hookup action.

Cancun, Mexico

If water slides in bars and dance ﬂoors
covered in foam make you giddy, save up_
your money and go to Cancun. .

Wake up around noon to the sound of
the ocean. Sit on the beach or by the pool
sipping a pina colada. After this exhausting
afternoon, it’s time for siesta. Three hours
later, everyone is showered, starving and
sobering up and you eat a late Mexican buf-
fet outside. P \_

Then head to dozens of bars ranging
from Senor Frog’s with yard glasses of Dos
Equis to La Boom with its infamous Screw
Party.

Every Cancun bar packs its spring ’
breakers in like sardines so, you’re guaran-
teed to see someone you know — or at least

someone’ you’ll know a little better  a

few more tequila slammers.

Schenley Park provides a place where’
you can escape the hustle and bustle of

There are several hidden treasures‘
tucked away in the park, including a

And once you get tired of walking,

The Andy Warhol Museum

117 Sandusky St.
(412) 237-8300

If you’re from anywhere near Western Pennsylvania and
you become famous, watch out. We Pittsburghers will immedi-
ately claim you as one of our own and broadcast it around the
world that you are from our glorious city. - ~ ‘

Andy Warhol left Pittsburgh for New York in the 1960s,
but we’ve got his museum. The Andy Warhol Museum on the
North Side is the largest one-person museum in the country.

Fluorescent cows, silk-screened Maos, silver clouds. . .ﬁnd
these lovely pieces of Warhol’s artwork all throughout the
seven-story building. I

But don’t think that the museum is just a one-person mau— -

soleum, either — it hosts several unique exhibits throughout
the year to challenge the way its patrons think. The Warhol also
regularly hosts avant-garde performers, musicians and other
artists. -

If you’re feeling hip and with it, the museum remains’ open
until 10 p.m. for “Good Fridays” each week, with special per-
formances or events taking place. It’s often the swankest place
to be on a Friday night in Pittsburgh.

Who knows, you just might discover the artist within —
after all, we all get our 15 minutes of fame.

Benedum Center for

the Performing Arts

Seventh Street and Penn Avenue

(412) 456-6666

The beauty of the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts is
unmatched by anything in Pittsburgh. Whether it’s your ﬁrst time
or your 31st, you will ﬁnd yourself in awe. I-am often spellbound
by the 500,000-piece crystal chandelier as I wonder how the the-
ater production I’m about to see will be accentuated by it.

From the voices of angles like Sarah Brightman to grand
musicals such as “Beauty and the Beast,” the Benedum has been
host to many unforgettable moments. Originally called the Stanley
Theatre, it was built in 1928, the name changing to the Benedum
Center after a $42 million restoration. The Benedum, which seats
2,885, is registered with the National Trust for Historic Places.

It is easy to see why the Benedum Center was voted the No.
1 live theater in Pittsburgh by Pitt News readers. Even with new
arrivals such as the O’Reilly Theater and old classics like Heinz
Hall, the Benedum is in a league of its own. Ifyou haven’t been to
the Benedum Center, I recommend seeing “Les Miserables,”
which will be showing there from Nov. 20 to Dec. 2. What could
be better then ‘seeing one of the greatest musicals in Pittsburgh’s
most stunning theater? A

Loews theater on the Waterfront is
an ideal setting to watch a movie.
Pillars outside add to the futuristic look
of the theater. Along with the fascinat-
ing atmosphere, Loews offers very
comfortable seating — even more com-
fortable if you spend the extra money to
get into the reserved section with the
leather easy chairs.

The “hot new release” of your
choice is always showing on one of
their numerous screens. At $8 a show,
the quality of the sound and picture is
worth a trip on the bus.

Watching people

Oakland is a magnet for the city’s
unique individuals. Maybe it’s because col-
lege students are so accepting, or maybe it’s
just because there is a high concentration of
people living in a small area. But regardless
of where you look, Pitt’s best free entertain-
ment surrounds us daily — just sit down and
take in your surroundings.

Whether it’s that girl in your biology
lecture who always shows up 10 minutes
late talking on her cell phone, or the “starvin’
artist’ 3 who's always asking for change with
his green plastic piggy bank, Pitt has no lack
of interesting people.

Pick any seat on campus and sit there

for 15 minutes; you are guaranteed to see
something that you did not expect.

Sit outside Hillrnan Library at
lunchtime and watch Scotty the chicken
man remember all the orders of a dozen cus-
tomers huddled around his grill. Observe the
people sitting on the strip of grass eating
lunch. Are there people passing out pam-
phlets?_ ' ~

Walk down Forbes Avenue. Stop and
talk to the hippies sitting with their dogs on
the stoop of the old Beehive theater. Listen to
the blind man loudly singing on the corner
by the drug store. _

Stop, listen and watch. It’s better than a
movie — it’s life.

With so many talented bands pop- .

ping up in Pittsburgh, how is a music

answer to one’s musical longings.
Known as a heavy rock band, the
musical stylings of Throttle Audio have

left their mark on the Pittsburgh music.

scene. The band plays original songs as
well as renditions of old favorites such as
David Bowie’s “Ziggy Stardust.”

Throttle Audio performs at numer--

Are you a Britney Spears fan? How
about ‘N Sync? If so, then you probably

won’t want to listen to The X, the no—non-- I

sense, kick-ass source for alternative music
in the ‘Burgh. _

The explosive 105.9 mixes hits ‘from
new artists like Seven Channels and
Flickerstick with the ‘90s gnmge tunes of
Smashing Purrrpkins and Nirvana. Added
are the antics and attitude and of DJ Alan
Cox, who‘ tends to offend listeners so much
that most might describe him asa trash-talk-
ing prick . .

The X boasts features such as “double _

Xs at noon,” in which they play back-to-

back songs from the same artist, and “pick

of the litter,” where a new song is played at
9 p.m. and listeners can call in to give their
opinion. ‘
Other features include contests, live
broadcasts and X Low Dough shows — local

concerts that The X sponsors at a cheap .i

PU°°- .
So if you’re looking for the latest in
alternative music or longing for the days of
ﬂarmel shirts and ripped jeans, The X is the‘

The Pitt News Best of

Antonio Bryant

Legit. .

That’s the one word that comes to
mind when thinking of Pitt’s star
wide receiver Antonio Bryant.

Some Pitt alumni tell stories of
how great Tony Dorsett was. Others
talk about Mike Ditka or Curtis
Martin. Our generation will have the
right to say that we saw the best wide
receiver in Pitt history, A.B.

He was the recipient of the Fred

Biletnikoff Award last season, given
to the nation’s bestwide receiver,
because he toasted secondaries for
big plays all season long.

A 200-yard game against Boston
College, another against North
Carolina, three touchdowns at
Virginia Tech — the numbers from

his 2000 season are just awe-inspir-i

mg. .
And he’s back to 100 percent
now, a factor that surely contributed
to Pitt’s mid-season turnaround.

Enjoy him while you can. He’s
something special.

those topless photos?”

And no one knows it better than
Pitt senior Mindy Peskie. .

In an all—out effort to win a spot
on Pitt’s 2001 homecoming court,
Peskie posted topless photos of her-
self — with brightly colored roses
covering her breasts ‘  around
campus in October.

Though the photos didn’t serve
their intended purpose, as Peskie

was never named to the court, they ,

certainly brought her attention.

But a week after homecoming
had come and gone, the attention
reached a new level. .

The original, topless photo of
Peskie left much less to the imagi-
nation, and copies of it were soon

circulating around the Internet,.

both in e—mails and on Web sites.
But, it was arguably all ‘worth it:
Peskie beat out star athletes, home-
coming royalty and thousands of

other students for the title of best»

campus celebrity.

Professor
Jonathan Harris

Professor Jonathan Harris under-
stands that when teaching, time is of
the essence — that’s why he prefers
50-minute classes to the more
unwieldy hour and 15 minutes.

“You can’t sustain the lecture very
well for longer than 45 minutes. The
downside of the course is that you end
up having classes on Friday, and no one
likes that,” he said.

Harris‘ down-to-earth approach to
teaching has made him a favorite of
students. He specializes in intemation—
al politics, particularly the former

THE PITT NEWS

USSR and now the Russian Federation.
He also teaches comparative and world
politics. ,

“I pay a lot of attention to students’
writing and helping them to improve,”
Harris said. “And I try to make my lec-
tures clear and comprehensive. I try to
make the material as dramatic 2, as ‘I
can.”  " e -

administrator
ennis Donham

Before leaving Pitt on medical
leave, Judicial Affairs administrator
Dennis Donham made quite an
impression on students; It may have
been his Abraham Lincoln ‘quotes
that did the trick.

Student Government Board

’ President Jeff Alex had particularly

kind words for the readers’ choice for
best administrator.

“He has always been more than
willing to help students,” he said.
Alex praised Donham, saying he
often makes appointments to talk to
students to do anything he can to
help them out. '

Laughing, Alex also described
Donham as “adamant” about quoting
the 16th president as often as possi-
ble.

Perhaps Donham would have
summed up his best of election with
a Lincoln quote as well: “Public sen-
timent is everything. With public
sentiment, nothing can fail; without
it, nothing can succeed.”

Pitt notice
otlicer
Tim Delaney

Tim Delaney is Superman.

Like the Man of Steel, Delaney routine— '

ly switches identities. At time he is police
chief, atﬁother times he is interim police
chief, and at still other times he is just the
mild-mannered Tnnrny D. And though he
has yet to prove _that he can leap tall build-
ings in a single bound, he’s still the most
popular oﬂicer on the Pitt police force.
Notorious for calling the students of Pitt

his “kids” and for his continual elfons to lay ,

the smack—down on those hasty drivers who
repeatedly ignore the shiny ‘yield to pedes-
txian” markers on Bigelow Boulevard,
Delaney is always looking out for us little
Panthers.

Delaney has been with the Pitt police
for more than 28 years. During that time he
has been.a regular season ticket holder for
Pitt football and basketball.

So while he may not be more powerful
than a locomotive ——- or spawn a legacy of
comic books and bad TV spin—olfs —
Delaney is still our local hero, and we are his
Jimmy Olsens.

organization  
Pitt’s best studentorganization,
Student Government Board, holds a
massive amount of power on campus
for one main reason — they ultimate-
ly control the money allocated to other

student. groups. If an organization
needs money for a project oran event,

they go to SGB for funding. SGB’s-

“yeas” and “nays” can dramatically

alter an organization’s direction.

The board holds public meetings
every Monday night on the sixth floor
of the William Pitt Union, in which
routine business is sporadically pep-
pered with moments of intense drama.

There’s more to SGB than the nine
elected board members —— there are
also l0‘committees, such as freshman
affairs and an environmental commit-
tee. '

Chairs report back to the board at
the public meetings every week. At

. the conclusion of the meeting, board

members make their closing remarks
‘and next Monday, it’s back to bylaws
and procedures as usual.

Place to stmlv
Hillman Library

In the not too distant future, as ﬁnals
week approaches, droves of students will be
searching for the perfect place to study.
Many will ﬁnd the solitude of a dorm room
appealing, or will be drawn to the serenity of
the Cathedral of Learning commons room.
When the studying gets tough, the tough get.’
to Hillman Library.

At Hillman, students can browse
through four ﬂoors of books on a variety of
topics from media effects to the Bible.
Hillman also offers material on microﬁlm,
videos and an extensive. but perhaps under-
used listening center where students can lis-
ten to their favorite music CDs.

If information and great tunes are not
enough, Hillman also boasts The Cup and
Chaucer, a ground ﬂoor coffee shop that
provides a relaxed environment where stu-
dents can grab a bite to eat or check their e-
mail. Hillman has a computer lab on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor for students who need to do online
research or write papers. ‘

Although some students may be enter-
ing thelibrary for the ﬁrst time during ﬁnals
week, they are sure to ﬁnd that the quiet,
calm atmosphere and abundance of infor-
mation make Hillman an ideal place to work_
on a paper or hit the books.

ping you off where you want to be.
Whether it’s the daily commute to
your job Downtown or a buck—wild
shopping trip to Ikea in Robinson
Town Centre, PAT transportation is
fabulous, fun and free.

If taking the upper campus
shuttle to Trees Hall is as far from
the Towers as you are willing to
stray, you are seriously missing
out.

Grab your Pitt ID, pick a stop at
random, put on your “adventure”
cap...and see where PAT takes you.

Bad directions  

“Wl1ere’s Victoria Hall?”

“Right down there at the comer of Fifth
and Forbes. It’s a large glass building — you
can’t miss it!” , ._

If you’ve asked such a question and
received a similar response, you’ve been
had. Welcome to Pitt, freshmen. Receiving
wrong directions is merely a rite of passage;
you’re bound to encounter cunning upper-
classmen among your travels about campus.
You’re better off acting as the stereotypical
man, refusing to stop and ask for directions
— study that graphically intensive campus
map tl1at’s printed on the back of every sheet
your resident assistant gives to you and nav-
igate with conﬁdence.

Unfortunately, the campus map won’t
help you much in Posvar  so here’s my
advice: If you’re looking for Room SG58,
that means you’re really looking for Room 5
on the. ground ﬂoor that seats 58 students
comfortably. .

Cathedral  

So’ your parents here hand you

A haven’t got a clue what to do with

them.

The Cathedral of Learning is
always a hot spot among parental tyjpes.
While showing them the myriad of
Nationality Rooms, they’ll be amazed
that you picked such a cultural school

as you hide yawn after yawn and dream‘

about lying around lazily in pajama
pants. _ .

The Cathedral is the tallest educa-
tional building in the western herni-

sphere, quite a factoid to throw out to

the parents on their next visit.
There are always students studying
in the commons, and the grassy areas of

the lawn are constantly filled with the '

outdoorsy types playing Frisbee, rugb
soccer and football. '
Visit the Cathedral when those
unexpected parental drop-ins occur,
and smile in relief that we have it to
show off. - A

Greek 1  
tradition
Greek Week

It was either Vlrrlliam Shakespeare
or Twiggy who once said, “Between
parties and ﬁ1nd—raising, it’s a shock
those Greeks ever sleep.” Actually it
might have been Winnie the Pooh.

Anyway.

Regardless of the author, it’s true
that while Greeks love their parties,
they also pool their resources in a fes-
tive tradition known the nation over as
Greek Week.

The annual competition between
the 22 national fraternities and 14
national sororities may be structured as
a contest, but the results are impressive.
In ﬁve years, Greek Week has raised
$475,000 for charity and donated more
blood than any other organization in
Allegheny County.

Kappa Delta

At 60 members strong, Kappa
Delta might seem an intimidating place
for a young college co-ed. But accord-
ing to its members, the thing that makes
Kappa Delta such a great place is the
fact that it’s all one big family.

“For someone coming into college,
it’s a smaller group of friends within a
university,” said Kappa Delta member
Erica Aderhold. “A sorority like ours

. promotes friendship.”

“We’re the best because we’re fun,
we’re down.-to-earth,” said Tanya
McGregory.

The Kappa Deltas are known for
both their social outings and philan-
thropy. The ladies hold a number of
date parties and social outings. They
also raised more than a thousand dol-
lars for Prevent Child Abuse America
via a talent show they held with frater-
nity Pi Kappa Alpha. _ ,

Kappa Delta .promotes campus
leadership and involvement. Each sister
must belong to a campus group outside
of the sorority. “We pride ourselves on
diversity, so a lot of people know who
we are,” said Kappa Delta president
Jessica Belles. “Our sorority isn’t cook-
ie cutter at all.”

PhiKappa

Theta

Ah yes, fraternities —— thégproud, vir-

tually timeless tradition of brotherly love

and gentlemanly bonding.

Phi Kappa Theta can boast being
honored by the powers that be, earning
two mighty recognitions from the voice of
the people. Not only is it recognized as the
best place to hook up —— Pitt News read-
ers have also praised Phi Kappa Theta for
being the best fraternity this side of
Sparta

In addition to community service, the
image of this fraternity invokes the proud,
timeless tradition of. . partying.

If one needs to relax with the fore-
most authority on partying and fun, he or
she need only visit 3812 University Drive.

|I00|lI  
Italian

The Italian Room, Room 116 of the
Cathedral of Learning, welcomes students
and visitors with the peacefulness of a
Tuscan monastery, after which the room
was inspired. The style of the room’s design

is 15th century Italian Renaissance, a period

when Italian society was devoted to educa-
tion, religion, art and music.

The seats, designed after monastery
benches, have the names and founding dates
of universities in Italy carved on their backs,
the oldest being the University of Bologna,
established in 1088. All the seats face front
toward the closed wood cabinet that encases

' the blackboard. The eyes of Dante, the

author of “The Divine Comedy,” observe all
who enter the ‘classroom as the bronze bust
sits above the blackboard. .b

As Dante looks over the students ﬁom
the front_ of the room, the painted portrait of

Elena Lucrezia Comaro Piscopia .—~ the ﬁrst —

woman in the world to be awarded a uni-

versity degree —-— watches them from the -

back wall. The University of Padua granted
Comaro both a master’s and doctor of phi-
losophy in 1678.

An authentic Florentine ﬁreplace stands
to the right of the room, bearing the carved
Latin ‘inscription “O Lord, Do Not Forsake
Me,” a sentiment mirrored by students on
test days.

David  
Lawrence

When you took your tour of Pitt

, ‘before you came here, the Pathfinders
likely advertised it as the only 24/7

computer lab. Even at 3 a.m., the

David Lawrence lab still hums with ’

activity as procrastinators try to "fin-
ish their papers for their 8 a.m. class-

es. Thankfully, there’s always a com-

puter open at that time of morning, as
well as at most other times of the day.

Located at the confluence of
David Lawrence Hall, Posvar Hall
and the pedestrian bridge to the
Towers, this lab is situated in an
ultra-convenient location. It’s easily
accessible from anywhere on campus
and it’s also in a secure and well-lit
area, -
As extra amenities, David
Lawrence features a multitude of
scanners and CD burners.

Sleep  

To skip, or not to skip: That is the ques-
tion;

Whether ‘tis nobler to make the grade
and pass the class, or to seek shelter under
the warm covers of sleep and solitude, and
by sleeping, fail class.

To sleep — more, and more —- and by
sleep we say to end the countless profes-

sors, tests and notes that students are heir to!

‘Trs a time to be cherished, sleep.
~ To sleep — perchance to sleep through
an entire day’s classes: Ay, there’s the rub,

for in that deepest of sleeps, the dreams that ‘

come are of spring breaks, weekends and
relaxation.

When we have shuﬁled through. this
academic tumstile and into the world of
daytime jobs and responsibilities, fondly
will sleep be remembered. And so, let us
give pause to the beautiful, best reason to
skip class: sleep.

P—E—N—N-S-T
sucks 

nothing to do with our school anymore.

' Even though the administration has
silenced our band by not letting them
play the infamous part of the ﬁght
song, they can’t stop us, the student
body, from knowing that Penn State
really does suck. '

It7s always great to take time out 1

from your day to chant P—E—N—N-S-T
sucks. I can’t explain why— it’s just
invigorating. .

I know it and you know it. It’s just
a simple fact. They’re in the middle of
nowhere, worshipping a man who
probably no longer has control over his
bladder, doing things to farm animals
that I don’t want to talk -about.

Our football team kicked their -

asses 12-0 last year and unfortunately

‘ we won’t have the pleasure of seeing

our team do it again, at least not for
another eight years. But their basketball
team comes to the Fitzgerald Field
House on Dec. 8, so we will have at
least one more chance to let them know
that they suck.

  Cathedral  

For more than 60 years, the
Cathedral of Learning has graced the
Pit-t campus and Oakland at large.
The famed Cathedral is a massive
structure — so massive, in fact, that
it is the tallest educational building
in the United States, standing 535
feet with 42 floors.

The Cathedral is home to a three- ‘

StOI‘y COHIIIIOIIS I'0OIII, a COIl’lpl1ICI'

lab, the 26 Nationality Rooms, a’

cafeteria, and numerous administra-
tive offices, libraries and classrooms.
But perhaps the most intriguing fea-
ture of the Cathedral are the

restrooms — youhave to see them to

believe the size.

Construction on the Cathedral

started in 1926 and lasted until 1937,
due to the Depression-. To pay for the
building, the University organized

fund-raisers that included asking

children to pay 10 cents for bricks
used in construction of the landmark
in return for certiﬁcates proving they
bought the bricks.

Australia

The emotions you experience when
traveling abroad are often indescribable.
Especially at our vulnerable age, these
events help shape our lives. I

So how do you narrow down what
country to study in? Surely there arefac-
tors that inﬂuence our choices — climate,
language, opportunities to meet members
of the opposite sex. These all play an
important role, but for Pitt News readers,
Australia remains the top choice.

The climate is gorgeous most of the
year, the people are beautiful and the lan-
guage is an exotic twist on English. Good

on, ya’ mate! The people are overly f1iend- .

ly as long as you don’t ﬂaunt the assump-
tion that us Americans are loved every-
where. Australia is backpacker—f1iendly,
with affordable hostels everywhere. Head

down unda’, mate; I reckon the choice is,

obvious.

If you’ve ever walked past Clapp.
Hall and been run over by a mob of

, hundreds of students ﬂowing out onto

Fifth Avenue, you probably know two
things. One, that the mass exodus was
probably from the ending of an intro-
ductory psychology class. Two, that
the ﬂood was coming from this year’s
best classroom, L-9 in Clapp Hall.

* The amphitheater-style auditori-
unrcontains an ocean of comfortable
blue-cushioned seats with retractable
writing surfaces and" the front‘ of the
room holds the standard teaching
island and set of ‘slide-away chalk
boards.

The famed L-9, which you can
enter from sets of doors in either the
front or the back, hosts mostly intro-
ductory psychology classes, includ-
ing so.me that fill the room to its sev-
eral hundred—person capacity.
