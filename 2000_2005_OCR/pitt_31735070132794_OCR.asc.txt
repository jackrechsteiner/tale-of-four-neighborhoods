Professors for peace,not war

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

A troupe of demonstrators circled

the Cathedral of Learning "Duesday, to

protest U.S. military intervention in
Afghanistan and Iraq. The day marked
the two-year anniversary of the United
States’ first bombings in Afghanistan,
which launched the current military
campaign against terrorism.

Local activist groups, the Thomas
Merton Center and the Pittsburgh

Professors for Peace and Justice, orga-_

nized the march. p

“[What] we are here to show is that
we are still vigilant,” said Tim Vining,
executive director of the Merton Center
“We are watching what is happening in
Iraq and it has become clearly an occu-
pation and is not about liberating the
people of Iraq, so we are here to say that
it is time to bring the troops home.”

Ken Boas added that, “We need to
make our voice heard — that we oppose
this war, we oppose this occupation, and
we oppose the policies of the Bush
administrationﬁ’

Boas, a Pitt English professor and
member of the Pittsburgh Professors for
Peace and Justice, added that the Bush
administration’s policies are against
democracy, free speech and human
rights.

Protesters were about. evenly divid-
ed between students and older communi-
ty members. Many carried signs with
such slogans as “Bush lied. They died.

' U.S. out. U.N. in” and “Money for jobs

not war.” Two demonstrators wore T-
shirts advertising Dennis Kucinich, a
Democratic presidential hopeful, who
has been strongly anti-war.

“We need to be aware of the under-
belly of the actions that have been taken
in Afghanistan and Iraq,” protester Tom
Blancato said. “People are buying the
Fox News channel version of -. ‘We are
out there saving the world.’ The truth of
the matter may be very very different.”

“I believe that the sanctity ‘of life
should be the top priority of any govem—
ment,” Craig’ Dicht, another protester,
said. “I don’t believe preventable deaths
should be allowed to happen, and I

believe that, in this war, every conﬂict.

has been a perfect example of a govem-
ment disregarding that very fact, that
every life is precious.” V
“It’s an over-simplistic view of the
world when you feel ‘you have to
respond to violence with more vio-
lence,” he added. V '

After unsuccessfully trying to get basketball tickets online, some students went
up to the Petersen Events Center or tried calling their box office to get them.

tern could not handle the amount of
traffic on the site early this morn-
ing. We contacted the company to
try to increase the bandwidth, and
they were able to get it up and run-
ning.” _

But some people were still hav-
ing problems. Bob Bagaley tried to
register early Wednesday morning,
but every time he tried, the Web site
would not-work. ’ _

“It told me the site does not
exist,” he said. “I came back later
and put the stuff in, and it told me
the server is busy, and it had a timer
that said it would take 60 seconds. I
sat there forever.”

While some students had trou-
ble with their ID numbers, that was
not the main problem. According to
Earle, the number of students who

_ could not get their IDs to work was

small, and it was most likely due to
the fact that their IDs were fairly
new. _ (

“Some people with new IDs are
still in the system with the old
code,” Earle said. “The issue was
not with the codes; it was with a
system overload.”

Earle continued by saying he
Wanted to apologize to students and
hoped that the athletics department
was able to take care of everyone.

“I feel bad for the students,”
Earle said. “We really worked with
[Student Government Board] to
hear the concerns, and once again,
we’ve made’ it difficult. I think it
was a great setup; the system just
couldn’t handle the traffic.”

But not everyone agreed with
Earle.

“They said this was supposed to
be so great,” Bagaley said, “but
there’s nothing great about it.”

Few attend, movement -

continues in new forms

Demonstration, page 2

According to Bell, these images indicate
that a plane did not cause the damage
and that the attacks were part of a con-
spiracy.

“Nobody can answer my question.
Why I can see no wreckage whatsoever
of a Boeing 757?’? Bell said. “The hole is

smaller than a Boeing 757. The wall did- -

n’t fall down for half an hour, and when

it did fall down, it was a very tidy heap,

and there is no [plane] wreckage.”
Tuesday’s protest consisted of 50

people, a tiny tumout compared to the .

5,000 who demonstrated in Oakland last
January or even the 200,’ according to the
Merton V Center, who gathered in

’ Schenley Park in August.

According to Vining, the anti—war
and anti—occupation sentiments have not

Adwiridled; they have just taken different

forms.
“I think what’s happened is that the
peace movement has become much

more mainstream,” he said. “You hear,
-the mainstream press and people who

are not normally anti—war who are now
questioning the occupation in Iraq, ‘who

- are questioning the amount of money

we’ve spent there and who are realizing
that there are no. weapons of mass
destruction. It doesn’t make the news

' because they are not organization rallies

but when we have the majority of the
people [questioning the occupation], that
speaks for itself.” .

Boas said; “The peace movement is
regrouping. They ' are‘ talking amongst
themselves how to best reorganize and
oppose what will be a long—terrn struggle
to overthrow these forces of repression.”

MRI affects Pitt, doctors care

does the value of a degree,” he said.

Recalling what he described as
a favorite saying of Chancellor
Mark,Nordenberg, he added, “Many
of the University’s greatest accom-
plishments come through the life
work of our alumni:”

But while Lauterbur’s award
has had a positive effect on Pitt, the

discovery that won him the prize

has changed the way many doctors
perform certain examinations.

“It’s had a huge impact on med-
icine,” said Jordan, the chair of
Pitt’s chemistry department.

Jordan described his experience
with MRI technology when he lost
the use of his arm from a pinched
nerve. ~

Doctors used MRI on the back
of his neck to find the nerve, and he
has since regained the use of his
arm.
Without MRI, Jordan added,
doctors would have needed to cut
open a patient to find the pinched
nerves, which can cause loss of
mobility or back pain.

” Lauterbur, who is a professor of
chemistry, biophysics and computa-
tional biology at the University of
Illinois at ‘ Urbana‘-Champaign,

-received his doctorate from Pitt in

1962. a

He began his work toward MRI
about the same time;

According to Jordan, Lauterbur

got his idea from nuclear magnetic‘

resonance, or NMR — a research

tool used in chemistry to under-

stand the molecular composition of

compounds.
“[NMR] hadn’t been used in
biology,” Jordan said.

“He had this idea that you could .

use it to get biological pictures.”

NMR uses chemicals to identify -

the wave patterns from which

chemists can deduce molecular

composition.
MRI, however, uses the reso-
nance of the protons in water to

indicate the composition of the

object being examined.

Since water. makes up 66 per—.

centof the human body, almost any

organ in the bodyis a prime target -

for MRI examination — without

requiring any chemicals or invasive

surgery. ‘ I » ,
Seong-Gi Kim, a professor in
the Neurobiology Department of
Pitt’s medical school, has used MRI
in his research on brain function
since about 1991. I
With MRI, he produces color
maps of thelbrain, with different
polors indicating different parts.
“Different parts of the brain

lead to different functions,” he said, .

explaining how the MRI—created
maps help people to see where dif-
ferent functions originate in the
brain. _ I

In 1973, Lauterbur created two-
dimensional structural. images by
altering a magnetic field, then

recording the emitted radio waves.

_ includes a student’s QPA, an essay about

their goals and a letter of recommendation
from a professor. .

The scholarships were made possible
by a donation from Hall’s family. His
father, John Knox Hall Sr., a retired histo-
ry teacher and principal, attended the
reception. /'

“We wanted to do something to
memorialize him,” Hal1’s’father said. “It
seemed apropos to his life to have a schol-
arship to the University; He loved Pitt -
all of his degrees were from Pitt. And he
loved teaching, no matter if the class was
500 students or ﬁve.” _

Hall had been a member of the psy-
chology faculty since 1999. Department
Chair Anthony Caggiula said the scholar-

ships are a “ﬁtting tribute” to a professor ,
' who was “extraordinarily popular with his ,

students and really connected with them.”
Fischer and N adeau will each receive
$5,000 for tuition through the scholar-‘
ships. Both students are planning on
- attending ‘graduate school, where Fischer
plans to study, neuropsychology and
N adeau to focus on terminal illnesses.
‘”I‘here’s so much uncharted territo-
ry,” Nadeau said. “I just want to be a part
of expanding the knowledge of disease
causality and psychological illnesses.”

Hall died in April 2002 of cardiac I

anhythmia and myocardial ﬁbrosis — a
heart attack, according to a coroner’s
report. ' ‘

Fischer added that, the scholarships
would help Hall’s memory to ﬂourish.

Fischer said.

But Jordan said the 30-year

accomplishment and his receipt of

“In the medical field, .they’re

they spend anywhere from a week
to a month discussing a candidate
for selection.

Jordan ‘added that recent devel-

opments in computer technology’

have played a critical role in the
visual display of MRI—produced

“This depends on development
in computer software and computer

Once again, a basketball ticketing mess

What initially appeared as a
much-welcomed gesture of goodwill
toward students’ ticketing concerns
seemed, at the end of the day, like a
gesture of another kind — a big,
extended middle finger.

To avoid a repeat of last year’s
basketball ticketing debacle —
which ended with a lot of unhappy,
diehard fans without tickets, and a

, lot of “just lucky,” lottery-winning,

casual fans with student season tick-'
ets they didn’t really want — ‘the
department decided to implement a
new system, wherein students could
log on to the official department
Web site at 8:30 Wednesday morn-
ing, enter their valid Pitt e—mail
addresses, student ID numbers and
credit card numbers, and, if they
were among the first 1,400 to do so,
get the coveted student tickets.

It seemed so simple. So elegant.
So fair.

Students were trying to pre—reg—
ister as early as midnight.
Wednesday morning, the site was
crashing because of excessive traf-
fic, the ticketing window wasn’t

coming up, and refreshing the site’

often proved futile.

Some frustrated students called
the box office at the Pete, or even
hiked up to the box office there. In
an astonishing display of preference
for ticket revenue over any sem-

blance of fairness, the Pete box
office sold tickets as early as 8 a.m.

During the time tickets were sup-
posed to be available online, the
department realized —— shock! —
that the site couldn’t handle the traf-
fic and called the company that runs
the site in an attempt to get an emer-
gency increase in bandwidth. Let’s
see if we can think of a better time to
have made that call - how about at
the time when the decision was made
to offer tickets through the site?

What should have been an auto-
mated, calm, fairway to distribute
tickets to those most desirous of
them turned into a free-for-all.
Offering tickets at the Pete was a
gross injustice to those fans who
attempted to follow the set guide-
lines.

But after all is said and done —
and it is; nothing can be done to rem-
edy the situation now -— Pitt sold all
the tickets. They made all the money
they could from student seating.

‘ A monkey could have figured out
that the Web site might have had

no investigation into the capabilities
of the site and no contingency.plan,

The Faketrix is real,

By Virtue of me being close
friends with enough women for my

— parents to question my. heterosexu-

ality on an almost hourly basis, I’ve

become privy to certain information

that I doubt most men realize,

though should: women are faking it
. a lot. ,

Buddy, I guarantee you’ll be
unpleasantly surprised at just how
many girls have dramatized a sigh
or contrived a few pants in the pres-
ence of your whirlwind of
Casanovarations.

The truth is that, in a

, recent survey, more than

70 percent of women
admitted to faking  at
least once, with a hearty

ing they imitate sexual

There are -books at
your local Barnes and
Noble with titles like,
“365 Ways to "
‘Counterfeit an Orgasm” ‘
and “Why Can’t He Find
my Clitoris?” .

This isn’t just’ some minor

‘ issue; it’s a goddamn institution.

Granted —— as my penis denotes
— I am no woman, and I can never
really understand the intricacies of
what exactly.leads a woman to fake
it. -

I’ve never been in the situation
where I’m getting pounded for a
goodhour, the lube ran out 40 min-
utes ago, and I surmise that I might
be able to speed things up with a
couple imitation ‘oohs’ and ‘work
me, grandpas’ so I can watch Conan
already. I’ve never had to deal with
a pipsqueak boyfriend who never
lasts a minute but I make him think
he’s a freakin’ dynamo because I
like the kid. I’ve never had sex that,

at times, feels good, but does not
FEEL GOOD.

Though these are valid reasons,
it doesn’t change the fact that fak-
ing it is undoubtedly a deceptive
practice. It’s creating a world

_ around us blinding us from the truth

— the ‘truth that we’re not getting
women off. I call it the Faketrix,
and, Neo, it is loco. " M ‘ “

. A harried impulse from men
would be to blame this entirelyon
women —— they are the ones faking
it, right? To that I say, “Bah, you
foo-ls!” That’s like blam-
ing your cat for dying
when you’re the one who
didn’t feed it.

I wonder if much of’
the problem is related to
the sexual apparatus in
question. I don’t mean to
insinuate that the vagina,

zlebox rife with switch-
es, levers and labia majo-

mess of wires, bellow.-

where!”

Comparatively, the human

wang’s instruction manual is so

short that it_ can be written on the
shaft of even the daintiest of penis-
es: “Pull me till I jizz or b1eed.”'

Ergo,’I‘ theorize that most men lack V V

the definitive programming to work

that ‘gina because their own sexual",

contraptions are stuck inthe techni-
cal Stone Age.— seriously, they’re
just skin sheaths with balls for gar-

A way out of America’s cultural hole

Comrades, are you feeling
bored, listless and irritable? Do you
curse daily the futility of your own
existence?

You’re not alone. We
all need something new
to redefine ourselves
and catalyze the next
great American social
revolution.

For years, this coun-
try has suffered from a

 

behavior and the last several

albums of Metallica, not to mention
the shamefulness that is Linkin
Park.

Now, the next obvi-
ous step is to examine
those cursed sports that
dominate the thoughts
and aspirations of the
average American. True,
for better or worse, foot-
ball, baseball and basket-

vast cultural void, ball make up a noticeable
despite the valiant chunk of American cul-
efforts of television and _ ture. Our childish obses-
movie producers to fill it J-R Ffi_dY , sions with everything
with teen comedies and ‘ C°'""""5‘ sports is known and

heartwarming Robin
Williams films. 7

What about music, you say?
True, we’re attributed with some of
the very pillars of modern music:
jazz, blues, and rock ‘n’ roll. Yet,
just look at how they’ve degenerat-
ed.

The day that “R&B” started

referring to craptastic singing

ensembles who pride themselves on.

the masterful use of the inter-
minable, noodly, faux—soul trill,
was the day that America divorced
herself from her rich blues heritage.

And don’t even get me started
on rock ‘n’ roll. It’s as if all evolu-
tionary offshoots of rock got cocky
during their narcotic—hazed hey-
days. Punk has regressed into an
intolerable, 'saccharine—sweet,
whiny poppiness thanks to the
damnable influence of Green Dayin
the ‘90s.

Meanwhile metal has totally
discredited. itself with disgraceful

ridiculed worldwide. But
is this a good thing, comrade? Let
us transcend the sadly accurate
stereotypes of meat-headed
American ignorance.

We need something with. as“?

much appeal as football that can
creep subversively into the homes
of every American and thereby con-
vert them into supporters of the rev-
olution. Yes, you’ve guessed it:

- bridge!No other game is as perfect-

and entertaining as this, the highest
evolutionary step of card games.
It’s the very culmination of game
development. Not one soul to whom
I’ve introduced this great game has
failed to be at first intrigued and
later obsessed. ' " e ~

What’s more, we.can use it as _

inspiration in organizing our revo-
lution. We shall organize cells of
four, each person with the name of a
cardinal direction. They’ll commu-

nicate the secrets of the revolution‘

to each other with a complex,

seVen—level, five-denomination sys-
tem of bidding. The winner of the
bidding — we’ll call him the
declarer — will communicate with
the declarer of another closely
related cell, and so on, thereby
secretly passing on all important
revolutionary information, until it
reaches me, the Lord Declarer.

We’l1 create a new American
society, a true meritocracy. Anyone,
regardless of race, creed or profes-
sion, shall be able to compete in
nationally organized bridge tourna-
ments. Those of greatest prowess
will be granted high-level positions
in our ﬂedgling government. Of
course, being the Lord Declarer, I’ll
be gracious enough to take on the
responsibilityof leading our new
nation. _

Sure, bridge isn’t technically an
American game by origin,
we’ve already adopted it and have
been revolutionizing it for decades.
Grandmothers across the nation can
attest to that very fact as they rub
their hands in anticipation of the
privileges they’ll enjoy in our new,
bridge—based society. ’

So, comrades, the time to rise
up has come! Who will join me in
the greater glorylof our country?

Who will take part in the bridge_

revolution that’s already sweeping
acrosscampus today?  anyone?

JP Fridy, the Lord I?eclarer, doesn’t
judge you foryour obsession with
football or Blink 182, since he real-
ly isobsessed with the game of
bridge. He can be reached ‘at

jzf7@pitt.edu.

 

but"

Dear Editor:

It is an absolute outrage how this supposed “eas-
ier” system of getting basketball tickets worked out.

You wake up really early and keep clicking on -

refresh on your computer while watching reruns of
SportsCenter just to keep yourself awake while
pulling out your hair because every friggin’ Pitt stu-
dent is trying to access the same Web site as you, and
that results in sheer disappointment and a lot of
built-up frustration.

Yeah, everyone thought the lottery last year was
such a horrible idea, and they thought this year’s
idea would be the savior by easily clicking a few but-
tons on your computer. Uh, no, not even close. V

At least in the lottery last year, everyone had a
fair shot at getting tickets, but this year’s process is
such a joke and totally not expected. Even calling the
box office serves no purpose, because the automated
machine ironically says, “For convenience, log into

our Web site, buy your tickets without waiting,
you’ll get our best available seats for the events you
want and get immediate confirmation.” .

Convenience? What convenience? The
University must rethink this new, unjust way of buy-
ing tickets, and figure out a more efficient, fair way
(hint, hint: like the lottery). It’s just really sad when
I’d have a better chance at seeing Pauly Shore get-
ting mauled by a bear in the Hillman Library ground
floor than being able to purchase tickets.

There will be a lot of pissed off, bitter people, .

including myself, walking around campus for a_ while
due to this failed system,» and if this happens to be
the permanent wayof obtaining Pitt tickets of any
sort in the future, I’d rather resort to eating ketchup
packets from the Union in my room than to even,
attempt to buy tickets.

both parties included. ’ - ‘

While greater communicative-
ness could be key ‘from the
woman’s side, I think, for men, a
simple heightened sensitivity in
-attentiveness and empathy -— a
modified mentality of just a little
subservience —— could significantly

Look, fair enough, I don’t real.-
ly have all the answers.

But I know we all need to get

out of this frickin’ Faketrix, so let’s

try doing it together.’

Who knows, it’s worth a shot.

female orgasm, Ben Rubin just

might have done his job. E—mail

History comes alive  

California has earthquakes,
Kansashastomados and Floridahas
hurricanes. Living in Western
Pennsylvania, we don’t really think
of ourselves as residing in a place
where natural disasters occur. On
May 31, 1889, the residents of
Johnstown, Pa. didn’t either. Oh,
how wrong they were.

On that fateful day, the

Conemaugh Lake dam burst,‘
unleashing 20 million tons of water’

that ﬂooded the 18-mile valley
between the lake and Johnstown,

A leaving 2,209 dead.

_ As hard is it is toimagine what
that amount of water would lookalike
even 18 miles down the valley, a
DVD entitled -“Johr1stown Flood”
depicts it all too vividly. Narrated by
Richard Dreyfuss, the DVD chroni-
cles the events leading up to the
ﬂood — the all-too—familiar story of
“The Boy ,,-Who Cried Wolf’ — the
ﬂood itself, and the devastating after-
effects.

Residents ignored the warnings
to evacuate. One man tells another
that the ﬂood is coming, and the lat-
ter replies, “I call you»and your horse
a coward. I’m staying.” He perished

in the ﬂood. Fami lies were separated ‘

from each other, sometimes ﬂoating

‘on pieces of wood to safety, others
A being carried to their deaths. The

documentary points out that most of
the victims perished due to blunt
force to the head, rendering them
unconscious and proving to be the
Cause of their subsequent drowning.
Robberies ensued, with some rob-
bers slicing olf women’s ﬁngers to

. steal valuable jewelry.

' The DVD is ﬁlmed in black and
white, which adds to the depiction of
destruction. -Drawings and pho-

_ tographs of the aftermath ‘are also

used. Actors playing survivors of the
ﬂood give their testimonies of the
events as they saw them, some even
smoking cigars. A

The documentary has
Pittsburgh roots. It was ﬁlmed par-
tially in Pittsburgh, and the founder
of Pittsburgh’s Inecom
Entertainment Company —‘ who
distributed the documentary —
Michael Bussler, received a bache-
lor’s degree from CIVIU. W

The producer/director of the
ﬁlm, Mark Bussler didn’t have it
easy whﬂe ﬁlming the DVD. His
biggest obstacle in ﬁlming the docu-

mentary was ﬁlming the summer »

events in winter —— braving the ﬁigid
winter weather and hiding snow in
the shots. To bring‘ viewers
back to the present, the black and
white cinematography gives way to
color shots of » the area today: the
drained reservoir, the solemn-look-'
ing Plot of the Unknown Dead in

Johnstown’s Grandview Cemetery A

and the lush colorful landscapes.
The documentary clocks in at a

little over an hour, and not a minute

is wasted. It is full of historical facts,

‘but  t0,qbnVey them in an

interesting, fast-paced manner.

The only downfall of the docu-

mentaryisthatit failstomention the
Johnstown Floods of 1936 and
1977. Perhaps second and third

installments of thedocurnentary will I

follow.
On I ‘Saturday, ,, Oct. ; I1,
produc r/director Mark Bussler will
give a talk about the making of the
“lohnstown-“Flood. ” It will take
place at the Barnes .& Noble book-
store at the Waterﬁont in Homestead
at] pm. For more information, call

The undisputed heavyweight
champion of funk,- George Clinton, is
coming to  Small’s Theatre Friday
night, and he’s bringing Parliament
Funkadelic along for the ride.
Although ticket prices may seem a little
steep at 40 bucks a head, try to keep in

mind that Clinton is the reason we have"

funk. If Dr. Funkenstein wants, 40
bucks for an intimate appointment with
only 549 other concertgoers —— 550 is
the maximum capacity for Mr. Small’s
— you should consider yourself lucky.
There is no other artist in the histo-
ry of music who has played a more
inﬂuential role in the development of
funk. Traces of Clinton’s unprecedent-

ed work have found their «way ‘into
nearly every genre of popular music we
love today. Whether it be in rhythms
used by Eminem or in the music of
Lenny Kravitz, it’s not hard to ﬁnd
traces of Clinton’s work in popular
music today. It’s also not a coincidence
thatmost successful pop music artists
have George Clinton listed on their list
of most inﬂuential artists of all time.
Parliament Funkedelic is a collec-
tion of some of the most gifted‘ and
awe-inspiring funk musicians around
today. This band will spurt out more ear
candy, whether it be avant-garde guitar
and bass sounds mixed with a live drum
set or horns and electronic keyboards,

than a morning radio DJ reading off a
list of school cancellations during a
blizzard. '

Let’s face it, folks —— you can beat

‘ around the bush, you can tell yourself

you shouldn’t spend the cash, but come
9 p.m. Friday, there are going to be 550
concert—goers who are going to be the
envy of Pittsburgh’s night life. We have
all been to parties and heard the ques-
tion “Who wants the funk?” Not
uncommon. But when was the last time
you heard it directly from the lips of the
man that made it cool for the rest of the
world to say for the last three decades?
While you’re standing in some
cramped line in a poorly lit, damp base-

George Clinton is going to intimately funkify Pittsburgh

rnent, waiting an ungodly amount of
time for \a single warm beer from an

almost—kicked keg of Milwaukee’s Best '

Ice during a ‘campus party Friday night,
try. not to think about how much fun I’ll
be having yelling, “Ain’t no party like a
P-funk party, cause a P-funk party don’t
stop!” with the Doctor Of Funk him-
self.

George Clinton and Parliament
F unkadelic play an all ages show at Mr.
Small 3" Theatre in’ M illvale Friday, Oct.
10 at 9 p.m. Tickets are $37.50 and can
be purchased by calling (888) 549-

intriguing and mysterious feeling to‘

the nine tracks on this album. One
that a sticks out in particular is

“Homestead Goldmine,” where the
seductive Meeks lures you in with not
only his voice, but with the bluesy
guitar that sets the mood of the song.

After several different lineup
changes, The Close settled with gui-
tarist/singer Meeks, bassist Dustan
Nigro, and the newest additions,
drummer Keefe Justice and vocal-
ist/keyboardist Fedor.

It’s A Secret to Everybody is a

to the ‘70s

great addition to a CD collection if
you are interested in a touch of some-
thing different to spice it up and add
a little flavor. The lyrics seem very

simple ._ and can be quite whiny at A

points, but overall, it’s a mixture of
blues and classic ‘rock that has a
sound unlike anything around today.
In the end, it’s a one-of-a-kind blend

that definitely works.

Anyone who has ever listened
to the Hilton sisters talk knows
that beauty and brains don’t usual-
ly go hand in hand. Anyone who
has ever heard the music of pro-
gressive rockers Kill Hannah
knows that the key word is “usual-
1y” —— because it’s been a long
time since a band this brilliant has
come around-

Although the members of Kill
Hannah must collectively own .
enough eyelinerand hair products to
last a normal girl a lifetime, and the
vocals sound unmistakably female,
all five have one X and one y—chro—
mosome.

The band’s major—1abel debut
release, For Never & Ever, puts pop
ﬂavoring into the cult—rock sound.

The opening track, “They Can’t
Save Us Now,” sounds like ‘80s new

“Unwanted” is Kill Hannah’s answer
to Good Charlotte’s “The Anthem”
— it’s something that social rejects
can listen to, and take comfort in the
fact that there are others like them
out there and maybe they aren’t the
rejects after all. A
While listening to the tracks,
there is evidence that the vocals
aren’t being done by an unknown
female ——- Devine sounds masculine

every now and then.

The members of Kill Hannah
make music that is almost as stun-
ning as their looks. They don’t

sound like anything else ﬂoating in

the airwaves right now, and it’s
probably going to be a while before
their underground style catches on.
But now is their time, despite
sounding ahead of their time and
behind it simultaneously.

Directed by Prince Chatri

“He will bleed from the nine ori-
fices until he dies.” -
This looksas painful as it sounds,
and Thai director Prince Chatri
Chalerm Yukol lets us see the results

of a king being poisoned in intimate 1
detail. He also gives us a smallpox»

epidemic, the ceremonial execution of
a deposed child king and happier
events, like an elephant roundup, all

in equally vivid detail, in his film_

“The Legend of’S_uriyoth’ai,” which
opens Friday A at '@Pittsburgh
Filmmakers Harris Theater down-
town- . a . . ’
“Suriyothai” is a kind of film
almost-unique to small‘, national cine-
mas. Made withthe assistance of the
Thai royal family — to which Yukol
belongs —_it cost a fortune, broke all
domestic box—office records and prob-
ably eludes most American audiences.
' The .main character is Princes-s
Suriyothai, who turns down true love

at.the story’s beginning to preserve
peace in her kingdom. This is, we are
told, the first of many sacrifices she
makes for her country. We have to

take this on faith formost of the pic-’ A’
:ture’s runtime, as she takes a back
seat to the Shakespearean intrigues of .

other characters vying for the throne
of the “First King of Ayuthaya.”

The result ‘is a confusing, sprawl-
ing epic in the. -spirit of Cecil B.

Demille, featuring "a cast of V thou-_‘

sands. The nearest American, equiva-
lent is last year’s “Gods and
Generals.” Both» films take on an

Pitt forward Keeyan Young attempts to steal the ball from a Bucknell defender during the Panthers’ 3-2 victory over the

Bison. Young scored a goal in the contest.

Pitt beats Bucknell by one goal

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Panthers’ men’s soccer
team rallied to score three goals in
the second half en route to a 3-2
victory over the Bucknell Bison last
night at Founders Field.

Junior Forward Keeyan Young
ignited the. Panthers’ offense by
scoring 42'seconds into the second
half. The play developed when mid-
fielder Tyler Bastianelli flipped the
ball to Young who slashed in on net
and fired the ball past Bison goal-
keeper Adam Edwards.

A few minutes later, midfielder
Shawn Wildman moved the ball to
Johnathan Clow. Clow shot the ball
on net, forcing Edwards to make a
diving save.

Soon after that, Young worked
the ball across the middle and
passed it over to Wildman, who was
slashing ‘down the right side of the
field. Wildman moved the ball into
the box to the left of Edwards and
crossed it to Clow. “ '

In an attempt to shoot‘ the ball,
Clow deflected the ball on to Bryan

Headrick. Headrick wasted no time
in shooting the ball to the back of
the net. The goal came at 50:34,
with Wildman and Clow receiving
assists on the play. _

The third goal came at 60:17,
when. Headrick worked the ball

down the left side of the field and '

out of the corner. He worked his
way toward the net, but stopped and
passed out to Bastianelli.
Bastianelli took the pass and quick-
ly shot it from 25 yards out.
Edwards dove to make the save, but
was unable to get a. hand on it.

The Panthers (4-8 Overall, 1-4
Big East) had several more opportu-
nities in the final 30 minutes to add
to their lead over Bucknell (6-5).

Panthers’ midfielder Marco
C_arrizales was all alone as he head-
ed toward Edwards after receiving a

. pass from forward Jeremy Gillespie

with about 25 minutes left, but the
play was blown dead on an offsides
call. , ' _

Young had the same experience

twice inthe final ten minutes of the _

game, when play’ was stopped due
to an offsides call as he was head-

ing toward the net all by himself.
“" Even though the Panthers were

‘scoring goals by the bucketful in

the second half, they still had "to
worry about Bucknell’s offense.
Bucknell’s first goal came 12
minutes into the first half,’ when
Panthers’ defensemen Clay Haflich
turned the ball over to Bucknell,
which allowed play to remain in the
Panthers’ zone.
The Panthers regained possession
only to lose it on a misguided pass
through the middle. Bison’s for-
ward Chris Beekman took the errant
pass and attacked the net. He kicked
the ball from five yards out while
being taken down by a Panthers’
defender. The ball soared past
Panthers’ goalkeeper Justin Lowery
to give the Bison an early 1-0 lead.
Bucknell joined the early sec-
on-d—half scoring party when Bison
midfielder Scott Visnic scored on a
breakaway two minutes after the
Panthers’ third goal. Visnic con-
trolled the ball on a clear by mid-
fielder Mark ‘ Mascarenhas.

Pitt shafts
fans again

 

Oops, Pitt athletics did it again.

The athletics department managed to a,

screw over Pitt students again this year
with men’s basketball student season tick-
ets. This year, it was supposed to be differ-
ent It was supposed to be a fair way to dis-
tribute tickets.

Well, you messed up! You messed up
big time.

The athletics department came up
with a new idea this season in distributing
season tickets to students.

Beginning at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday
morning, students were supposed to be
able to go online to the athletics depart-
ment’s Web site, punch in their Pitt ID
number, Pitt e—mail address and a valid

credit card number. The ﬁrst 1,400 stu- - ’

dents to do this were supposed to get tick-
ets.

Unfortunately, there was a malfunc-
tion. Students began going on the Web site
to register late Tuesday night.

By the time I went on the Web site at
8:20 a.m. on Wednesday, the site had
crashed. I sat on the Web site for close to
two hours while the loading progressed
slowly. ’

The furthest I got was the screen that
was supposed to allow me to begin order-
ing my season tickets, but it kept refreshing
every 60 seconds, and there was no pro-
gression after that. ‘

Finally I had to go to class. After my

_ ll a.m. class, I went to the Petersen Events

Center and also called the ticket oﬁice. The
Pitt Police had closed down the ticket lines
by the time I arrived at the Pete, and it took
forever to get through to the ticket ofﬁce.

When I ﬁnally did get through to an
operator, I was told that season tickets were
sold out.

What’s wrongwith this picture?

Well, there are several things wrong.
The major thing being that the ticket office

' had no business selling any, tickets over the

phone or at the Pete on Wednesday morn-

ing without some type of announcement-

that they were doing so.“

Staff Writer

Every member of the Pitt
women’s tennis team was able to
come up with at least one victory
when the Panthers competed at the
Women’s Eastern Collegiate in

 West Point, N .Y over the weekend.

The individually contested
Eastern Collegiate Tournament,
which is played with four singles
and two doubles ﬂights, is the
largest college tennis tournament in
the country, bringing together 24
eastern U.S. teams.

Pitt entered five players in the
tournament, which was the third
tournament that the Panthers have
participated in to prepare for the
regular season.

Pitt’s highlight of the tourna-

ﬂment was provided by the doubles

team of Anne Davies and Hayley
Hughes, who made ‘it to the semifi-
nals of the No. 1 doubles ﬂight.

Davies and Hughes began their
run with a dominant first-round
effort against Rhode Island’s
Meredith Haas and Becca Hedden;
the Pitt team prevailed 8-0. The
second round had the Pitt women
set to face the No. 1-seeded team of
Alina Balasa and Jill Markowitz of
Rutgers.

Davies and Hughes were able to

U come away with an 8-6 victory after

taking down the top seed.
“This was a big win, which gave
us confidence -andshowed that we

could play with the best,” Head
coach George Dieffenbach said,

In the quarterfinals, Davies and
Hughes took on Christi Lazar of
UConn and Sara Markiewicz of
Army and defeated them, 8-3.

In the semifinals, Davies and
Hughes were matched up against
the No. 4-seeded team of Jenny
Munroe and Stephanie Price of
UMass. They played to a very close
result," but could not come out on
the winning side. UMass won the
match, 8-6, ending Davies’ and
Hughes’ run. ' -

“This was a really good accom-
plishment for the girls,”
Dieffenbach said. “There was one
team in the 1980s that reached the
finals at this tournament, but this
was definitelytthe best result Pitt
has had in recent years.”

With the run of wins, Hughes
now has 93 career wins and will
probably break into the 100-win

club at the beginning of the regular

season.’ According to Dieffenbach,
Hughes’ could also have a chance to
break the school record of 124
career wins.

Becky Emmers represented Pitt
in the No. 1 singles ﬂight and came
away with two wins on the week-
end. In her first-round match, she
was defeated 7-5, 6-3 by Hofstra’s
Erika Reggiani.

» Emmers then moved to the con-
solation round, where she defeated

Army’s Leah Gaunt, 8-2. Emmers_

then took on Rheanna Gaskin of

Bucknell in the consolation semifi-
nals, but was defeated, 8-5.
At No. 2 singles, Emily Hughes

began her tournament against Long‘

Island’s Merve Koksal. Koksal won

the match 6-0 and 6-0, sending“

Hughes into the consolation brack-
et.

In her first consolation match,
Hughes defeated Providence’s
Cheri Lapane, 8-6. In the consola-
tion quarterfinals, Hughes was
knocked out by Bucknell’s Tanya
Sichko, 8-6. -

Konita Jude, Pitt’s entrant in the
No. 3 singles, had a difficult time in
her opening-round match against
Marist’s Yana Krugly and lost, 6-3,
6-0. -

In the consolation round, Jude
was ready to face L_oyola’s Gina
Turturiello, but Turturiello with-
drew because of injury, moving
Jude into the consolation semifi-
nals. In that round, Dorothy
Iwanowicz of UMass defeated Jude,
8-2.- I .
“The girls have been" working
hard, and this weekend, it showed
that we areimproving. We were
able to win some matches, and with
some more work, we will "definitely
be ready for the regular season,”
Dieffenbach said.

Pitt will enter the team of
Hughes and Davies in doubles and
Emmers in singles at the remaining
tournament of the fall season,~the
ITA meet, which will be held at‘
Virginia Tech. on Oct. 24.

time of 22:35.

The Pitt men’s and
women’s cross country
teams competed at the Paul

Lehigh last weekend. Pitt’s
women’s team was able to
finish in the top half of the
competition, despite miss-
ing Maureen McCandless.
Although the men’s team
did not fare as well, fresh-

season—best time, and
junior Nick Westerman

It was the spring of my junior year. Our -A
high school tennis team limped into the sec-

ond and ﬁnal round of the conference play- ‘

offs, expecting a quick defeat and another
season closed; We’d played our ﬁnals oppo-

nents twice in the regular season. They’d

given us our only two losses‘, 5-2 both times.
They weren’t us and we weren’t them.
Ourteamheardthatseven oftheir 10 starters
took private lessons. None of ours did. We ,
used bargain and borrowed rackets. The
windbreakers around our courts were tat-
tered. We shared buses to practice with other
Yes, we played hard and we trained, but
never at_ the expense of a good time. We’d

often rather drive balls into the pond, a la 1

Barry Bonds, than work on backhands.
We’d drill shots at one another until some-
one went down with the word Wﬂson tat-
tooed on his gut.

Our jokes were crass, our language
crude. We discussed professional tennis
close to never. A crowd of misﬁtson the
court, we shared even less olf. But on that
day, something ﬁt together. ‘

The wind crept through the wetlands 'of
Cow Meadow Park, our territory. Then the
enemy’s big, yellow monster pulled into our
parking lot.

Having only six courts for seven match-
es, one contest would have to wait for anoth-
er match to ﬁnish play before it could begin.

"The coaches’ picked second doubles, my

spot Mypartner Ryan and I took spots on
the bench to watch our ﬁrst singles player
take on a genuine titan of tennis in our con-
ference. ’ ', ,

Realizing that, in all probability, every

one of the other six. matches would ﬁnish '

before us, Ryan and I knew that for our
match to have any signiﬁcance, our team
would have to win three of six. Then fate
showed up. I . »

The other tearn’s ﬁrst singles player
went down with an injury. He cut his ﬁnger
while opening the can of tennis balls. He cut
his ﬁnger and couldn’t play!

Our captain won the match against their
substitute handily, 1-0. We were on top.
Ryan and I took the court. While we were

playing, our second singles team lost, 1-1,

third doubles won, 2-1, ﬁrst doubles lost, 2-
2, and third singles went down, 2-3.

last forever
Fleming, page 16 ‘

When our fourth singles player came
up with a win, evening the score at 3-3,
Ryan andl knewthe entire team match was
ours to win or lose. It was just the way we
wanted it

The ﬁrst set of the best-of-three match
was close. They played us well. But we
came out on top. The combination of my
quickness and Ryan’s blunt, dominating
power proved to be too much for them.

In the second set, we drove straight
through them. The match ended with a serve
from Ryan and a poor retum from our oppo-

nents. Standing on the left side of the court,-

I watched the ball come over the net I

watched it drift toward the out-of-bounds '

line and across the whiteness that divided
success and ‘failure.

I’ve never prided myself on having a
strong memory, but I can still feel today
what I felt back then, three years ago. Pure
excitement, it was like ﬁre. We celebrated
for weeks.

I’ve yet to tire of telling that story, and I

can’t foresee that I ever will. It’s still so .

vivid, even if the exact details have made

‘way for nostalgic speculation. .

There are few moments in my life that

stand out as important, and if asked why, I’d I

probably be hard-pressed to justify why that

game meant so much to me. There was ‘
something indescribable about it — some»
thing that taught me more about myself then

all the hours I spent in a classroom.

But standing there, holding my racket
in sheer disbelief, -watching my teammates
ﬂood around us wildly, Irealized that I’d lost
something. .

For me, the greatest moment ever in

‘sports was now a thing_of the past Nothing

I’ve seen has compared, not Todd Pratt of
the Mets homering in the 10th to putdown
the Diamondbacks at Shea Stadium, not sit-
ting in the press box at Heinz Field, nothing.

And so this is why I keep going back, to
watch and to play. And sometimes I feel like
the cliched old man, scanning the horizon
for a long—lost friend, continuing to look for

' something to give me half of what I felt back

then on those old green and red courts, try-

‘ ing to take back what I lost.

Maybe I’ll get older and maybe, one
day, I’ll stop wanting to be in that park
watching thatball slip out of bounds. But I
doubt it.

Nash, page 15

As soon as they realized that they
messed up, the athletics department should
have canceled the sale of the tickets. Then
they should have put their heads together
and come up with a new plan — preferably
trying it again and preparing the Website
for a larger volume of traffic, or coming up
with a different method of selling tickets.

I guess nobody had the foresight to see
that this plan might not go off without a
glitch and might have been in need of a
backup plan.

But Pitt is so worried about making a
buck that they just sold tickets to whomev-
er showed up at the Pete after failing online

or were walking through, noticed the line,
then decided to hop in it. . '

. What about those who had classes and
had no way of getting to the Pete’ before the
tickets were sold out? ,

Publicity was a problem all along.
There were people who did not even know
tickets were going on sale on Wednesday,
then, to top it off, you just start selling tick-
ets to people who show up.

Unbelievable! As long as you made
your money, it doesn’t matter who bought
those tickets. It could have been somebody
who doesn’t even know what basketball is

'or_ ‘somebody who just wants to make a

proﬁt by selling their tickets.
Well, last year’s lottery system isn’t

  Fond memories Pitt athletics drops ball in student ticket controversy

‘looking so  right ;r1ow.’_, At least it was
somewhat fair. At least everybody had -

equal opportunity.

Wayﬁtop go, athletics department. You
rip us off by not even offering us one fourth
of the stadium’s capacity in tickets, when it
is our tuition that helped build the arena,
and now you pull this. *

The athletics department really
dropped the ball this time and, in all likeli-
hood, has no way of correcting this prob-
lem. Keep it up; eventually your despicable
greed will catch up with you.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports editor for
the Pitt News and is disgusted with the lack

concern that Pitt has for its students.
