Tough issues
debated from
many ‘angles  

ANDY MEDICI 
Staff Writer V

The Litchﬁeld Towers Lobby was
the site of a spirited debate Wednesday
afternoon as four student organizations
debated issues ranging from the war on
terror to free trade to same-sex mar-
riage. "M

The debate, organized by Student
Citizenship Alliance, featured two left-

leaning groups, the College Democrats ’ A

and Students in Solidarity, and two
right-leaning groups, the College
Republicans and Panthers for American
Values.’ ‘ '

‘ Student

Government Board

President Brian Kelly moderated the

debate. .

The first topic was thewar on terror.

Brandon Boyd, a senior at Pitt and
president of the College Republicans,
spoke about ﬁghting the terrorists on
their home ground, and how’ terrorism is
present throughout the world.

I “We have to take the ﬁght to the ter-
rorists," he said. “It’s not just-' Iraq; it’s
the entire worl .”  .

Katie Emery, who, along with
William Gardella, represented Students
in Solidarity, spoke of the need to
change tactics andseek helptfrom. the
international community. ‘ A '

“The war.on terrorism isia ﬂawed
concept. You can’t make war ‘on a con-
cept,” Emery said. ‘,‘We need to stop iso-
lating: ourselves from the international

2 community.”

‘Free trade‘ was. also a subject of

. debate, as both sides -differed on

, ing from a free-trade policy. . V

Cristal beer signs and Cuban culture greet diners

KEVIN FUNK
Staff Writer

While Cuba and the United States
continue with their decades.-long polit-
ical spat, their cultures are uniting at
Kenny B’s Eatery in downtown
Pittsburgh.

Inside the Cultural District diner, a
bright red Coke refrigerator shares
wall space with pinned-up_ maps of the
socialist island and ads for the Cuban
beer Cristal.

“Verano Cubano A es Verano
Cristal,” or “Cuban summer is Cristal
summer,” reads the forest-green ﬂier,

an icy cold bottle reclining in the back-
ground.

On the buffet counter, a thick, all-
American mashed corn dish sits next
to the typically Cuban “moros y cris-
tianos” — black beans and white rice.
Then there’s the chef/owner’s wife,
Cuban-American Susana Rodriguez
Myer, effortlessly switching between
her rapid-fire Spanish and equally ﬂu-
ent English — “Cuidate, nos vemos --
take care!” she says to a departing cus-
tomer.

This is not an everyday American
diner.

Susana’s husband, Ken, opened

the place six years ago on the site of an
old Greek restaurant when he decided
to try a new career in the culinary arts.
In_ the beginning, the menu consisted
of mostly American fare, with only a
few Cuban items — items that did not
sell.

Despite Pittsburgh’s small Latino
community, the Cuban food — which
includes “pan con lechon” (fresh roast-

ed pork on a hoagie bun) and_

“tostones” (fried green plantains) —
started to catch on, and it now com-
prises 60 percent of the menu.

“Cuban [food] is taking moreand
more momentum,” Susana says, sitting

“Now, Cuban sells more than any-
thing else,” Ken adds, emerging from
the bitter cold outside in his stained

white T—shirt, and slowly rubbing his _

cheeks.

“I’m the Cuban inﬂuence,” she
brags.

While Kenny B’s continues to

serve customers with Cuban delica-
cies, it was a customer who sold

Susana on her need to go back and
visit the land she left some 40 years
ago.
The gentle-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer,
of the Grarmny-winning Cuban group
Buena Vista Social Club, who came to
Pittsburgh in early February last year
for a concert, was that customer.

“It sparked something in my
heart,” she says of Ferrer and the
group’s visit, now commemorated on
the restaurant’s rippled, creamy yellow
walls by a" signed “Greetings from
Buena Vista” poster depicting a typi-
cal, crowded Old Havana street. “I had
to do it.”

After many months of navigating
through paperwork and U.S. travel
restrictions, Rodriguez left on Dec. 7,
2003, for her native Caribbean island
with her daughter and her husband,
whom she met while she was a student
at Pitt.

“This is the house  this is the

beach,’.’ she says, scanning‘ through a -

photo album from the trip and remi-

niscing about her past. “When I finally

got there, I couldn’t believe it.”

Growing upin the northern coastal
- town of Puerto Padre in the eastern

province of Las Tunas, Rodriguez
found herself in ‘a Cuba that was going
through revolutionary — and, in her
family’s eyes, negative + changes. In

the aftermath of the 1959 triumph of- .

the Cuban revolution, Rodriguez’s

_ family decided to leave the country.

“We’re the ones that were against
the revolution,” she ‘says, remember-

ing a one-year waiting period to. leave ‘

the country, in which her family’s
assets were frozen, leaving them so

they could not legally earn any,
income. “We want to run our own_

lives.”
‘ Leaving in 1963, the 10-year-old

Rodriguez arrived with her family in .

Ann Arbor, Mich., where her father
had contacts from pre-revolution trips
to the United States.

“We came with nothing,” she says.
“Two changes of clothing, no money,
nothing.” .

But if she does have a certain
antipathy for the revolutionary Cuban
government —- “socialism is a good
concept, but let’s face _ it —— _it’s not

Pleated, lime—green, zebra—striped, 

rufﬂed, silk or bow—tied. Hijab — the
practice of wearing headscarves
observed by many Muslim women ——,
serves the physical purpose of concealing
the head and neck from public sight in an
act of modesty. ‘
But according to some, it is an

I. American symbol of oppression. 2 ‘

A panel discussion, presented by th
Women’s Studies Program Wednesday. in
the William Pitt Union, sought to exam-
ine these Western assumptions from a
feminist perspective by bringing together
two women from the Islamic community
in a formal discussion.

Dalia Mogahed — panel member,

practicing Muslim and self—proclaimed

ardent feminist -— said that for her, hijab ’

is the ultimate profession of her faith.
Hijab, she said, brings her dignity and
respect, and is meant not to conceal,’ but
to make her body her own private busi-
ness.

Hijab, according to Mogahed, gives
Islamic women the opportunity to be
judged based on their true selves as
human beings, and not on their physical
exteriors.

the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, said she

The idea of the panel discussion was

Hija doesn’t mean oppression, women say

yarmulkes, large Cruciﬁxes, and other
visible signs of faith. According to panel
moderator Carol McAllister, who is an
assistant professor of Health Services
Administration in Pitt’s Graduate School
of Public Health and the Women’s
Studies Program, enacting the ban would
be a feminist victory to some, but a vio-
lation of religious freedom to others.
McAllister explained that some
women of Malaysia adopted hijab as a
sign of sincere religious commitment.
She added that images or pictures in con-
sumer cultures or in the media undermine
the true meanings of Islam and hijab.
Both Mogahed and McAllister
explained throughout the discussion that

»women of Islam" are afforded equal

rights, dignity, autonomy and inﬂuence
— but that in some Islamic nations, such
as Afghanistan, both men "and women
have -been oppressed.

Riffat Chughtai, a panel member and
executive director of Pittsburgh Muslim
Family Support Services, said that young
women of Islam, specifically ‘in public
schools, are unable to identify with cul-
turally accepted clothing trends, such as
bikinis, tank tops, or even shorts. Hij ab,
she said, givesyoung women the oppor-
tunity to gain an identity by “going back
to their Muslim roots.” .

After the panel presentation, a round
table discussion ensued. '

answered. Estimates of the cost toclean‘ up the island
range from the local claim of $160 million to the U.S.
govemment’s allocation of $26 million, as of July
2003. The eastern tip of Vieques, a small, triangular
patch of land beyond OP 1, is still littered with explo-
sives. Chemicals from detonated» __an'd undetonated

explosives have seeped into  ground water. The._

Debate, page 1

“When [President George W.] Bush
says that Working at a McDonald’s is a
manufacturing job, that’s insane,” said
Jared Solomon, a freshman and vice
president of the College Democrats.

The organizations also discussed
Bush’s economic policy, and the rifts
between the left and right were obvious.

, Emery stated that the country’s eco-
nomic policy, is not working and that
more has to be done to help.

“It’s hard to lift yourself up by boot- ‘

straps if you don’t have shoes,” Emery
said. A A .
Bill Bradley, a junior and member
of Panthers for American Values,
defended the administration’s handling
of the economy, and compared it to what
would happen in“a liberal administra-
tion. '
“When liberals are in charge, there

 are more costly policies that lead us fur-

ther and further into debt,” he said.

2 On the topic of affirmative action in
relation to college admissions, Bradley
stated that it was just another kind of
discrimination. .

“What afﬁrmative action does is

‘that it discriminates ‘based on race,” A

Bradley said. - -

’ Laurel Schwartz, a freshman and
business manager for the College
Democrats, talked about the need to help
minorities receive an education.

“It is true that minorities are held
back in this country; this is just one way

to help,” Schwartz said.

Gay marriage was the subject of
heated debate, as events and court deci-
sions around the country have made this
issue a prominent one.

“Marriage has always been between

a man and a woman,” Bradley said,‘ _
adding that same-sex marriage -goes

against many people’s beliefs. “We
should not be forced to embrace this.”

Solomon spoke out in support of the.

subject, rejecting arguments that it
would lead to incest and polygamy.

“I find it appalling that opponents ‘

list all the traits they say gay marriage
will lead to, such as incest and
polygamy. I guess if you are gay, you are
all those things,” Solomon said.

The "last topic was the only issuethat
all involved could agree on, that being
how Pitt was better than Pennsylvania
State University. ‘a

Gardella criticized the school’s
Nittany Lion mascot. -

“That’s just a miscolored panther
with a stupid name,” he said.

The audience was then allowed to
submit questions to the groups, with the

majority of questions revolving around H

the economy and free trade.

Boyd defended his position on free
trade, and argued that everyone has a
choice of what to buy, and if they did not

believe in companies moving to third- ‘

world nations, they should not buy their
products.

“If you don’t like what’s made in ‘

China, don’t buy it,” he said. “I don’t.”

sees positive aspects in Cuban society.

“In spite of the need, there’s so
much joy,” she says about the concur-
rent presence of both a generalized
poverty and of happiness amongst the

‘Cuban people’.

“Even though they may have this,”
she says, clutching salt and pepper
shakers in her hands to demonstrate
the little that most Cubans have,

‘.“they’ll share it.”

And though she_ places signiﬁcant
blame» on the Cuban government,
Rodriguez also faults U.S. policy.

“The embargo has got to go,” she
says, referring to the U.S. govem—
ment’s policy of banning most travel
and trade with the island, which lies
just 90 miles south of Key West. “It
hasn’t accomplished anything  and

A there’s too much suffering.” .

The embargo has also affected he

 as a Cuban—American.

' “We have an open society, but the

Joy remains in Cuban society, restaurant A

U.S. government is telling me I can’t

go to my home country more than 21 V

days in a year,” she says of the U.S.’s
policy of capping visits of Cuban
nationals to three weeks out of a year,
as the ranging ﬂutes of Latin"-ﬂavored
easy-listening music eased from the
circular‘ cream speaker panels on the
ebony—speckled ceiling above her.

“My chorizo!” .=.she says," ﬁnding
sausage waiting for her on the counter
after running off to turn up one of,-her
favorite songs.

The language, like the decor and,
most importantly, the food, is born of a

combination of two cultures, two

nations and two peoples. It’s the taste
of a jam-packed Central Havana street,
on 123 Sixth St. Pittsburgh, and one of
which Rodriguez is extremely proud.
“We’ve always strived for authen-
ticity,” she says of their efforts at
being as true to traditional Cuban cui-

. sine as possible, which entails having

to. obtain Cuban-style coffee and
sausage from Union City, N.J. “Our
goal is to have an all-Cuban place.”

No credibility gap in massacre pictures

There are certain words that carry
more weight than pictures: “mutilate ,”
“insurgents,” “bodies.” These are just a
few of the thousands of words dedicated
to reporting the recent deaths of four
American contractors in Falluja, Iraq.
The four contractors were burned, their
bodies mutilated, dragged through the
streets and then hung.

And accompanying words such as
these are pictures — of crowds cheering,
of violence, of humans celebrating the
deaths of other humans.

Already, according to a Reuters
report, some «news sources have tried to
tone these pictures down, but thanks to

the Internet, they are available to all who_

seek them.

The same report quotes a former
CNN correspondent, who’s now a pro-
fessor at the University of Delaware, as
saying that Falluja has the potential to
form a credibility gap. “It would be inter-
esting to see if this is  a turning point
where people start to think that the Bush
administration’s arguments that things in
Iraq are generally going well do not
match what they are seeing on TV.”

Yet there isn’t a credibility gap here.
It’s a gap between those who access these
images — and whose views on the war
may or may not change resultantly -
and those who don’t.

During the Vietnam War, a credibili-
ty gap arose between what was reported

and what wasn’t, which caused many to
question the United States’ role there.
Whether images were not shown because
the media was exercising discretion, or
underreporting, people felt that they were
not getting the full story. ‘
 Falluj a, however, is not like V1etnarn.-
Rather than plastering the front page with
images, media outlets can put them on
the Internet, which, in this case, is a
workable medium between underreport-
ing and being disrespectful towards the
families of the victims. On the
Washington Post’s Web site, for instance,
a slideshow of images from Falluja
comes with the warning that some
images might be violent or disturbing to
viewers. . _

Falluja is also being compared to the
events in Mogadishu, Somalia, in which
18 U.S. troops were killed during a
humanitarian operation. Footage of this
may have swayed the Clinton administra-
tion into pulling troops from Somalia and
from subsequent actions.

Now, however, the Bush administra-
tion has dedicated itself to staying the
course, with the chief U.S. military
spokesman calling the attacks, “bestial,”
according to The Washington Post.

How the images of these attacks will
affect the Iraqi occupation, and the pub-
lic’s opinion of it, remains to be seen. For
now, at least, the media seems to be

‘bridging the credibility gap.

Resurrecting deadatheists not Christian

My eyes went to the top of my e-mail
account: “A plea,” sent by someone from
my church. I didr1’t know the person well,
and I could tell the message wo1Ild have an
air of activism about it, but I couldn’t resist

about the ghastly deeds of one woman who,
apparently, has set out to destroy
Christianity. She is ‘—— gasp —— an atheist.

“Madeline Murray O’Hare [sic], an
atheist, successfully managed to eliminate
the use of Bible reading from public schools
a few years ago,” the letter informed me.

broadcasting religious material, of any reli-
gion, is still a right  by the First
Amendment, which requires the govern-
ment “to observe a stance of neutrality
toward religion, acting neitherto promote

rim to inhibit religion,” according to the .

FCC’s regulatory interpretation of it.

But just because the First Amendment
is there doesn’t always mean we’ll follow it,
so I.thought I’d turn my questions to the
most reputable source of information avail-
able: the Internet.

At first, it seemed my fears werein line.

I found a number of petitions,

psimilartothe oneinmye-mail
box, that described ﬂie atro-
cious acts of religious persecu-
tion performed by O’Hare.

’ little prompt from my search
engine, which asked me if, per-
haps, I mean “Madelyn Murray
O’Hair.”

Perhaps the sly woman
was trying to stamp out

the way to stop the reading of
the gospel of our:Lord and Savior, on the air-
waves of America.” ' V '
The scoundrell
'Asajoumalist—andaplainold

American citizen — I’m raﬂier fond of my '

rights. Free speech is pretty nice. Of course,
free speech that challenges my beliefs might
be a little questionable, but that’s not the
point. I’m a Christian. ‘What would I do if it

church, and I couldn’t tune in to my local,
religiously aﬁiliated cable station and watch

‘a worship service on television?

My little ﬁngers moved to sign the peti-
tion at the bottom of the letter, which would
show the FCC and the Federal govemment
that we Christians deserve rights, whether
they’re constitutional or not But before I

could get there, I had a thought.

These rights are constitutional. School

prayer and the posting of the < Ten

Commandments might be up for contention,
and Howard Stem may have been dropped

1 by  of his’ previous aﬂiliates. But

Christianity by using a variety
of similar aliases?

Searching the new name,-I found dra-
matically different results. O’Hair is dead.
Her remains were found in a shallow grave
outside San Antonio, along with the remains
of her son and grandson; The three disap-
peared in 1995. This informalionrbaﬂled me.
An atheist, who devoted her life to letting the
world know that Christians were nuts with

‘unrealistic hopes, hadrisenfromthe deadto

continue her battle against religion. I thought

that right was reserved for faithful believers. ‘

But then, I found more. In December of

1974, two men did ask the FCC to “inquire -

into the operating practices of religious orga-
nizations’ stations,” according to the FCC’s
Web site. This petition ——- which was
assigned the moniker RM-2493 — was
turned down in 1975, and the FCC
explained that “must treat religious and sec-
ular organizations alike in determining their
eligibility for broadcasting channe .”

FCC, CAA should recognize that adults can say what they damn well please

Finals are approaching rapidly, and for
students living in close quarters, this means
one thing — it’s almost time for the ﬁnals
primal scream. The scream, for the unir1itiat-
ed, starts somewhere in the lower lung, and
ricochets-upward, ﬁnally storming out, only
to echo interminably against the
Quad buildings.

There are a few choice
words that usually accompany
the scream, most of which are
some variation on one or more of 
George Carlin’s famous seven
banned ones. It seems that, across
the pond, the United Kingdom’s
Channel 4 has anticipated the
armual season 0’ swearing and, in
response, produced a commercial detailin
the nuances of banned language. _ I

As part of a series of commercials,
Charmel 4 asked British and American
celebrities personal questions, such as how
often they had sex and what swear word they

said most often, according to a piece Bill,

Griﬂin, head of Channel 4 marketing, wrote
in The Guardian of London.

_ Apparently, Zach Braff, JD from
“Scrubs,” has a really dirty mouth, and Kelly
Os'bourne’s favorite swear word is

“douchebag.” Huh.

Channel 4 then took this celebrity
footage and spliced pieces of it together, so
that the ﬁlm became nothing but swearing,
and plarmed to show it at screenings of ‘.‘ Kill
Bill Volume 2,” ﬁguring that if people liked
violence, tl1ey’d probably also go
for dirty words. Unfortunately,
the Cinema Advertisers
Association barmed the ad for
_ being offensive, even though the
British Board of Film
Classiﬁcation had given it a green
light, albeit with an 18 certiﬁcate,
so that no one under 18 would
have been permitted to see it
 commented that such
offense was, “not that likely, in our opinion,
as it would have run prior to the most violent
mainstream cinema release of the year, fea-
turing numerous eviscerated corpses and
endless rivers of blood.” Um, ditto. V
Given the recent outrages in the United
States concerning breasts, Howard Stern and

ﬂre possibility that “the children” might be ‘
 harmed by hearing a dirty word or seeing a

piece of the female anatomy, this ban seems
like just another step towards our new,
improved sense of Puritanism.

Offensive or not, the ads would have

been shown to adults — the same chunk of j

the population that can make big decisions,
like voting or whether to buy big, purple dil-
dos. In short, this part of ﬂie population can
make its own decisions. And the ad has been
given enough hype that ﬂiose who wanted to
attend the gore, but abstain from the swear-
ing, could have wandered in a little late.

It’s an adult decision to make, and adults
should have been allowed to make it.

But more than that, people should be
given the option of what they want to see.
What happened to the whole idea of “we’re
all adults here?” Perhaps I’m too entrenched
in laissez faire attitudes toward regulating art

and expression. But in. the era of Federal

Communications Commission overkill,
there seems to be no middle ground between
sensible censorship — if there is such a thing
—— and screeching about the world’s moral
downfall.

I recently got into a debate with some-
one about parenting styles in the United
States. It was‘ my contention that children are
spoiled here, protected and pampered as
God’s little blessed beings, here to be cute
and wear funny hats. In a nation where most
believe that people are born to sin, we sure

do a lot to protect innocence. My opponent’s
contention was that childrenwere precious
little blah, blah, blah. She was probably more
qualiﬁed for the debate, because she actually
has children, while I own a plant But I think
that the idea of protecting vulnerable chil-
dren — even grown—up ones — from swear-
ing, sex and, to a lesser extent, violence, has
gone too far. Adults should be able to hear
swear words. Publicity stunt that Channel 4’s
ﬁlm is, it shouldn’t be barmed simply
because it contains things people don’t want
to hear. Obviously, ’I’m projecting my red-
blooded American values onto the United
Kingdom. But this is just one more example

of adults being denied the right to make their i

own decisions. In short, both the FCC and
the Cinema Advertisers Association should
stop treating adults like children, and inrro—
cent children at that l_et’s return the power
of decision to those who are ﬁt to decide.

And, on this side of the Atlantic, if we
want to hear naughty words, we’re going to
have to lean out our windows come ﬁnals
week.

Whenever I get upset about
not getting my way, my mother
tells me a story. Now, I’m no one’s
mamma, but this little tale will
have to do. In a village not too far

-from here there was a monkey

named Medeea. When Medeea
was just a little monkey, he was ﬁm
to play with. People in the village
learned from Medeea and it was a
resource ‘for the village, much like
the sewage system.

The little monkey grew to be a_

beastallits own; yet, like
the village sewage sys-
tem, it stinks! Medeea
used» to entertain and
inform the children of

it runs rampant through
the village, and villagers such as
Polly Tkin and Advert Eyesin
employ it and teach it strange
tricks. They even dress the monkey

in costumes so villagers will be‘-

confused and no longer recognize
it. Just imagine what this is doing
to ‘the children! One day, Medeea

-escaped the supervision of Polly

Tikin and Advert Eyesin and went
to the river to bathe. (Yes, even

- monkeys named Medeea want to

feel so fresh and so clean.)
_ On the way back, the little
monkey got lost While trying to

ﬁnd its way, it met amoose eating _
r A _, ﬂ 4; .a J. ) . :;,,‘. .',_r 1 __

discolored squashes. The moose

warned the monkey that what he ,

did in his home was his business,
but Medeea, being ﬁorn a squash-
loving village, hunied back to tell
ﬁre villagers of the moose and the
strange fruit. Immediately, rumors
spread throughout the village
about moose and their bizane eat-
ing habits. As if telling the story

was not enough, the monkey ven-A

tured back to the moose’s private
property to steal a mutated squash
and bring it back to the village for
the villagers to see.

There was no reason to violate
the moose’s request for privacy,
and parade its squashes around for
anyone to see. The villagers grew
squash of their own. In fact, it was
a prize-winning squash communi-
ty. Not only was the moose hurt by
Medeea’s actions, but also, a child
ﬁorn the village thought it would
be a grand idea to eat the moose’s
squash. The child got very ill, and
the village blamed the monkey for
what had happened.

Medeea was never trusted
again. The moral of the story is that
little monkeys with a sense of enti-
tlement to information and too
much power are not too far away
ﬁom being community gossips
that steal and endanger the lives of
children Also, it is wrong to steal
squashes — even from moose!

not, in fact, returned ﬁonr the dead.
It seemedthatlwas thevictimofa

More disturbing, however,
were the hundreds of people who
had signed the petition before it
reached me. There are an awful lot
of people out there, it seems, who
areliving infear ofadeadwoman.

Since 1974, the FCC has faced
millions of concerned callers, most
of whom have presumably
received a letter or e-mail resem-
bling mine. O’Hair, it appears, has
consistently been the named source
of the threat How does an irreli—
gious person attain immortality?
By letting people know they’re not
religious. O’Hair was not a partic-
ularly agreeable person. She con-
sistently bashed Christians, and
while some of her complaints were
legitimate — such as her case
against school prayer, which was
consolidated into the 1963
Abington vs. Schenrpp decision
that banned prayer in schools —
hergreaterbeefseernedtobewith
Christianity in general.
Considering that she was also a
rather overweight, homely woman
with an unpleasant disposition and
a propensity for arguing, she was
an easy target

But O’Hair was not an aver-

. age atheist, and there’s something

wrong with the hatred and con-
tempt for her that propagates these

. rumor‘s—+andrr.1ay have1es1.t9.h9r .

‘s. It. fit v ‘ll/3 -tr. _-,:_ -,, ._. i=_,.il, -a

suspicious death. Christians are
supposed to show compassion for
everyone, and, while most atheists
really don’t really want the pity that
some religious people want to heap
on them, they probably have even
less desire for death threats and
personal attacks.

O’Hair — or at least her leg-
end -—. is alive and kicking,
because many Christians want
someone to hate and fear. It’s not
easy to dislike the ﬁiendly, non-
churchgoing neighbor next door,
so some people tum instead to less
appealing, easier targets, like
O’Hair.

Holding beliefs of any nature
will be challenging at times,
because the nature of beliefs
implies that therewill be those who
disagree. Being an upstanding,
proud Christian can seem tough at
times, but the same applies to peo-
ple holding any other religious
identity, as well as any political,
social, sexual or racial identities.

I understand that most of the
people who signed the petition I

received are not atlreist-haters — or .

anyone—haters — but simply peo-
ple concerned about their rights,
and the rights of others. But I think
this petition originated out of peo-
ple’s fears, not of losing their civil
rights, but of beliefs they don’t ﬁnd
very palatable.

Art exhif

 

Through April 18 A 1 .
Carnegie Me||on’s Regina Gouger Miller .
Gallery ' v ' '
(412) 268-361 8

Some of the best art today makes you re-think,
your relationship to objects, events or places with
which you have regular contact. It presents some-

thing “ordinary” in a new way and begs you to con-' --

sider ideas that are not immediately accessible, but
are so intriguing that you can’t help wrestling with

Such is the case with the works of “Shock and
Awesome,” the MFA thesis" exhibition cur-
rently at Carnegie Mellon University.

Cassandra Jones’s ﬁve-minute photo
animation loop, “Eventide,” is one of
these thought-provoking pieces. It con-
sists of 1,391 photographs shown in
order to recreate the time’-based event
of a sunset. The sun slowly glides
down the wall on which the installa-
tion is projected, never changing in
shape, size or hue. The scene
around it ﬂips rapidly from image
to image, about four per second,
ﬂashing deserts, mountains,
oceans,'cities, lovers and friends
from all over the globe in front of
the same evening sun.

“Eventide” invokes ideas
about the dually universal and
personal nature of the sunset. It
presents sunsets, or “the sunset,”
with every imaginable person,
scene and landscape. Rarely do
we recognize sunsets as a com-
mon link among, all people of the
globe, but “Eventide” brings this
inherent connection to the surface.
Photos in the installation that fea-
ture weddings or vacation scenes
point to the personal meanings a sun-
set can have, too. “Eventide-” points
out deeper t emes in an everyday ’
occurrence that most have probably
never consciously considered before,
though we have seen innumerable sunsets.

In this vein, too, are the worksof Ruth
Stanford, which approach ideas of death from ,
new angles. Like Jones, she asks viewers to see . V
everyday objects and events "in an unfamiliar‘
way.

death and ‘rebirth by having grass grow out of the
headstone.‘ The ‘chairs indicate that everyone. is a
daily witness to and part of this cycle, perhaps not

thinking about it any more than we do when we rou-

tinelysit toeat dinner. The use of writing slates as

eventually rise, leaving the chairs empty or the
slates clean.

Although‘ this piece and those by the other
artists in the exhibition are quite challenging, itvis

the work of Fereshteh Toosi that creates the most ;

“shock and awe.” Using everyday materials, Toosi’s i

works take the theme of questioning normative con-
ceptions to the next level. Her pieces also question
western understandings of Eastern culture. In her
artist statement, Toosi writes, “I initiate absurd
investigations to examine the myopia of human
understanding.” . ' A
The ﬁrst installation serves as the coda for the

works that will do just that, giving thein a loose con‘-'

text. American media artifacts that have to do with
the genies, lamps and magic carpet rides stand rev-
erentially on wooden shelves. Complete from
tapes of “I Dream of Jeannie” to books like
“Grover’s- Magic Carpet Ride,”
piece seems to survey, in its stereotypically
depicted cartoons and illustrations on book
covers and package labels, the ‘narrow
nature of Western understanding about
the culture from which such ‘ stories
arose. ' '

those "descriptors by questioning
something more serious. Perhaps,
as an absurd manifestation of a
probably non-existent structure type,
“Nomadic boudoir” tries to point out
the ridiculous nature of foreign cul-
' ture stereotypes. It asks us to question
ourconceptions of other ‘cultures-— as
. in, do we really think such crazy struc-
tures exist, and if so, that they lookthis

way?‘
Toosi’s other installations are just’ as
puzzling and complex. And additional works
by Jones and Stanford, plus those by artists
- Lilith-Bailey Kroll, Shana Moulton and Sioban
- Rigg, are likewise intriguing works that ask you
to re-think -your relationship to the world

It's hard to describe the kind of
music Good Brother Earl plays. It’s a
little bit of rock, a little bit of country
and a little bit of jam, all mixed togeth-

combination of music is hard to com-
pare to any other music released today.

indicative of the style of his songs —
Keb’s lyrics are simple, pure expres-

by no means plain and simple. Each

ranging from country to coffee house

more upbeat than most blues. Some,

Find Prince Charming anda happy ending in “The Prince and Me”

“The Prince and Me”

Starring Julia Stiles, Luke Mably

Directed by Martha Coolidge

I s2n1‘.v1/2

A "fairy tale for the real world,
“The Prince and Me” is an every-
girl fantasy in which the girl from
the farm meets a royal prince who
doesn’t resemble a frog at all. As far

as this fantasy goes, the story is set
— prince meets girl, girl likes
prince, everyone lives happily ever
after. Thankfully, this movie throws
a few obstacles in_to7 the path of
romantic happy endings.’

" Paige Morgan" (Julia-‘ Stiles) is
the typical over-achieving college
studentwho is determined to stick
to her life plan of being a doctor and
traveling the world. ‘ She doesn’t

 

COURTESY POUNT PICTURES

have time to be in a serious relation-
ship, unlike most of her friends,
who are getting, married. Eddie
(Luke Mably) is a dashing, bad-boy
prince from Denmark who travels to
attend Paige’s school in Wisconsin,
posing as a regular student, and ends
up doing a lot more than asking girls
to take off their tops.

Once Paige and Eddie have
finally admitted their true feelings
for each other, it’s time for Eddie to
reveal his lie —— that he is actually a

‘ Prince. Now, Paige must ‘decide if

she is willing to give up her dreams
for what may be the love of her life.
The acting style and the chem-
istry of Julia Stiles-and Luke Mably
help make this film more original
and enjoyable than it could have
been with the familiar plot that is
the framework for the action. Stiles
plays her character convincingly
and with consistency, allowing the
audience to relate to her dilemma
about what to do about falling in
love with a prince. The-transforma-
tion that Mably brings to his charac-
ter, from rebel prince to regal king
of Denmark, is believable and well-
constructed throughout the movie.
Other characters add to the
humor of the film, which is never
lacking. Although the portrayal of
college life is rather idealistic, some
situations —— such as Eddie’s sloppy

roommate — are a perfect opportu-
nity to display the comedic skills of
all the actors in the movie. Without
these funny moments, the already
long movie seems even longer. Time
isn’t handled very well. While some
scenes last too ' long, other major
parts of the development of the plot
are glossed over, and as the charac-
ters go through their lives, it’s hard
to know exactly how much time had
gone by since the last major revela-
tion.

Elaborate sets and costumes
required to make this royal family
real addito the fun of “The Prince
and Me.” The setting of the royal
palace is beautifuland the perfect
background for some of the most
dramatic scenes in the movie. Most

:,of the dramatic scenes are pre-
“dictable, but with the good acting

and interesting sets, this can "almost
be overlooked.

“The'Prince and Me” is a cute
romantic comedy that will appeal to
most people wishing for their Prince
Charming. The realism of the story
and the charisma of most of the
actors save the movie from blending
into all the other movies that have
been similar in the past. For anyone
looking to achieve a warm-and-
fuzzy feeling, “The Prince and Me”
is a good bet.

At the beginning of the Penguins’ season, I appeared
in this space and extolled the virtues of the 82 games that
lied ahead. “Don’t underestimate these -kids,” I said.
“They’re not going to be as bad as everyone thinks,” I
claimed. “Just watch; come April, you’ll be all over the

. _ Penguins bandwagon when they make it to the playoffs.”

I’m not above saying I was wrong. Dead wrong. 21
wins and 54 points (as of April 1 at 4:15 p.m.) wrong.

Wrong to the tune of the Pens maybe getting the first V
_ pick in the next draft.

The Penguins’ season went so horribly awry that
even those “in the know” are shocked by their perfor-
mance — lowlighted by their abysmal losing streak a
couple months ago. It’s a sad state of affairs when a
hockey team can be as bad as setting the league mark for
losses a little over ten years -after setting the NHL record
for consecutive wins. OK, the loss record isn’t techni-
cally ‘accurate because they had one overtime loss, still

’ giving them. a point. But'c’mon, a loss is a loss, whether

it happens during regular play or ‘in overtime.
And now here we are, two games remaining in the

somewhat respectable — even if that level of
respectability is on par with the Pirates’ armual “This is
the year, guys! We’re going to hit .500!”?

-No way. There’s a whole other battle happening —-
the one for Lord Basement’s Pick. If the Penguins ﬁnish
strongly weak, solidifying their position as the worst in
the‘NI-IL, their chances increase dramatically in ‘getting
the first pick in an entry‘ draft weighted to favor the
worst team of the season. ‘

Usually, this isn’t a mark of distinction. "Go ask
Florida and Columbus how well they’ve fared with the
No. 1. pick.’ For that matter, track down Marc-Andre
Fleury, wasting away in the minors somewhere and: see
how being the No.- 1 pick has worked for him. - 

But this year’s different. This (year, the best pick
since some French-Canadian Lernieux kid is up‘ for
grabs. And if the Penguins win the losing battle, they’re
all but a lock to secure ‘Russian phenom Alexander
Ovechkin. ‘ -

If the Penguins ﬁnish with only 21 wins — even
though they should pick up one more win, ‘against either

‘ Atlanta or Washington .— their season will not be a total

loss. Hopefully. This is a weighted draft, after all. So,
even if they ﬁnish horribly,,there are no guarantees that
they’ll get the No. 1 pick and the coveted Ovechkin. .

' Even if it doesn’t happen, though, this has salvaged‘

Pens’ season, and they’ve finally found some soi=t- of - - — - - - - -_ - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - Sports.Vfew, page-13 --

Weather  
continues to

keep Softball  

off the field),

JIMMY JOHNSON ’
Staff Writer

Another day of rain in Pittsburgh kept
the Pitt softball team away from the dia-
mond, and with the precipitation forecasted
to continue throughout the weekend, the
Panthers are wondering when they will
open at home this season.

“Always something . we have to deal
with here in Pittsburgh,” head coach
Michelle Phalen said about the weather.

The Panthers (13-17) were scheduled to
have their home opener against Youngstown
State on Tuesday, but the home opener was
pushed back to yesterday against Robert
Morris. More rain prevented that from hap-
pening.

Now, after having the week off, Pitt will
now look to its weekend games against Big
East rivals Villanova and Rutgers. The lay-
off should not affect the Panthers, as
they’ve played a tough schedule to date and
could use the rest.

Today’s double-header against
Villanova has been moved to tomorrow at
noon, when the Panthers hope to ﬁnally
open their ‘home "schedule. It would also

mark the opening of their Big East sched-

ule.

“I’m happy we’re opening up at home
[against Big East teams],” Phalen said.

However, opening against Villanova
(11-12, 2-0 Big East) is going to be a test for
Pitt. Villanova went 34-15-1 last season,
and lost in the Big East Tournament
Championship game to Notre Dame.

“Villanova is traditionally one of the
better teams in the conference,” Phalen
said. “[But] we competed éwith them very
well.”

The Panthers played two very close
games against Villanova last year, but ended
up getting swept by scores of 6-3 and 4-2.

Second baseman Francesca DiMaria hit
a home run in each contest last year. She
ﬁnished the day 3-for-6 at the plate with
ﬁve RBIs and two stolen bases.

Pitt is scheduled to play Rutgers (14-15,
0-2) on Sunday at 12 p.m. The Panthers
split last year’s two-garne series with the
Scarlet Knights, winning the, second game

Pitt’s Zeffiro excited despite
going without her team

 

Today’s trivia question: who is arguably the best ath-
lete on Pitt’s campus right now?
No, it’s not Larry Fitzgerald, although that’s a
good guess. It’s not Julius Page or Carl Krauser, either.
Give up? It’s Alyse Zeﬁro, a senior gymnast who
will be competing m the NCAA Regionals this week-

‘ end at Penn State.

All Zefﬁro has done this season is record the ﬁrst
two perfect 10s in Pitt history, lead the team in scor-
ing on the vault and ﬂoor exercise, and help the
Panthers to their highest win total (13) since the 2000

to this point is that her team won’t be competing with
her on Saturday.
Teams are chosen for the NCAAs based on the

. number of points they score d11ring the season, not on

how they ﬁnish in their conference or how many wins
they have. '

But since she was the top performer on both the
vault and the ﬂoor exercise among gymnasts whose
teams weren’t invited, Zefﬁro will get to compete in
her two _ best events. On Saturday, while she’ll no
doubt feel excited about getting to compete one more
time, there will be a part of her that wishes her team-
mates were as well. ’

“It is a little discouraging to not to have them
there,” she said. “I said that throughout the season; I
don’t want to go to regionals without my team with
me. It was hard to take. We put in a lot of hard work
and accomplished a lot of great things. But they’ll all
be in the stands supporting me.”

If Zefﬁro performs like she has all season, she’

may not need much support from anyone. She won

    

SCBSOII.

Probably the only thing that could sour her season

Pitt Baseball prepares for weekend series with BC

J OE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

ThePittbaseballteamwillopenup a

‘ three-game series with Big East rival Boston

College tomorrow at Trees Field. Well, at
least that’s what the schedule says.

VV1th the continued rain that has been
battering Pittsburgh and the surrounding
areas during the past week, Mother Nature
may end up changing the Panthers’ plans.

Earlier this week, the team had a game
at Cleveland State canceled, and their game
against Kent State on Wednesday only last-

ing out

ed ﬁve innings. The schedule changing has
been even harder on the softball team, wash-

Youngstown State on Tuesday and Robert
Morris on Thursday. . _ .

_ Should the games go on as scheduled,
Pitt’s (15-4 overall, 3-0 Big East) batters will
' face a tough task trying
to hit the Eagles’ (7-14)
starting pitchers,
according to ‘Pitt head
coach Joe Jordano.

“Boston College
has three outstanding
pitchers,” he said.
jected to be a ﬁrst-round
pick. He pitches about
95 or 96.”

- Lambert is sec-
ond in the Big East in
earned nm average, giv-
ing up 219 runs every
nine innings, although
his record is only 1-2 on
the season.‘ i‘ The
Panthers will also most
likely face ' Boston
College starters Kevin

O’Donnell.

While the trio
led a staﬂ that posted a
3.66 ERA last season,
. Shepard and O’Donnell
haven’t putup numbers

season with .a 3.72

Shepard and _ Matt v

 

ERA, while O’Donnell is 2-2 with a 5.28
ERA. P

_ Part of the problemhasbeen the Eagles’
lack of offense. Boston College is_1ast in the
Big East, in batiing average (.246), runs

scored (94), home runs (ﬁve), hits (162) and

next to last in runs batted in, with .86.
. On the other side, Pitt is ﬁrst in the con-

ference in hitting with a ‘.326 average. The
v Panthers are led by PJ. I-Iiser, who leads the «

Big East with a .433 average and nine home
runs, including the garne-Winner against
Kent State. ’

I-Iiser is also 2-0 on the mound, with a
3.96 ERA. He will pitch against Boston

College along with Nick Evangelista and ..
p Andrew Kuss. A —

The. key that Jordano feels his team
needs to focus on is its hitting. .

“We have to take care of our at-bats,” h
said. “We have to be ready for their pitchers
and hit their mistakes. That’s what we did at

. Virginia Tech, which is a very good team.”

For Pitt to be successful, center ﬁelder
Ben Copeland and second baseman Jim
Negrych will have to continue to hit.
Copeland leads theteam with 34.hits, 27
runs and 10 stolen bases and is hitting at a
.410 clip. Negrych has an 11-garne hitting
streak, and is batting .403 with eight doubles

and 17 RBIs.

2004 gymnastics season one of best ever for Zeffiro, Panthers

Madness, page 18

the East Atlantic Gymnastic League title
on the vault -_—— only the third Panﬂier to
ever win an EAGL title and the ﬁrst on the
vault —— and her two 10s came in each
event against West Virginia and James
Madison on March 9. l

A goal that she set at the beginning of
her college career, scoring those perfect
10s, nearly didn’t happen. After coming
close in earlier events this year, Zefﬁro
ﬁnally reached perfection with only two
meets remaining in the season.

Determined and conﬁdent, Zefﬁro
never doubted her ability to do it and never
thought it wasn’t going to happen.

“Coming off [a meet against‘ George
Washington], I didn’t do so well,” said
Zefﬁro. “Competing two days later, I was
extremely determined. I wasn’t worried
that it wasn’t going to happen. I’m a ﬁrm
believer [that] if you put your mind
towards something, it’s going to happen.”

If only that worked out for other ath- _

letes at Pitt. It’s a shame that so much
emphasis is placed on revenue sports,
while the smaller sports —— some of which
had better seasons — have championship-

‘ caliber athletes who have led their teams to

incredible feats.

That’s not something that’s lost on the
athletes on non—revenue sports teams,
either.

“A lot of sports go unnoticed,” Zefﬁro
said. “I mean, men’s swimming has won
the Big East how many times in a row?
Volleyball just won the Big East, too.
Everybody’s doing great things.”

If things go as plarmed, not only will
Zefﬁro do a few great things this weekend,
but also beyond. L

A sociology major, Zefﬁro has already
been accepted to Pitt’s graduate school for
education with the hope of someday

_ becoming a kindergarten or ﬁrst grade

teacher. Since she’ll still be around cam-
pus, Zefﬁro looks forward to having a
chance to help out the team next season in
any way she can. '

As for now, the best way to go into

Saturday’s events is to treat them like any
other meet this season.

“I’m not going to change my mindset
at all, because if I start thinking things 
I’ll get too crazy about it,” Zefﬁro said
with a laugh. “The main thing I tell myself
is to get out there and do it and have faith
in your abilities and not to doubt any-
thing.” I

No need to change what has worked
to this point, and no need to question
Zefﬁro’s conﬁdence, nor her standing in
the Pitt history books.

Pitt News, and he’d like to try the balance

the Pens’ season. Fans of the team are
used to tight stretch runs. Usually

.they’re for first place in the division

or the eighth spot on the playoff ros-
ter. But. the past couple seasons
haven’t afforded Penguins fans any
such luxury. What’s there to root for, a

speedy recovery for the ailing hip”of -

Mario Lemieux?

The race for last place and the No.
1 pick has given Pens’ fans some
glimmer of hope, both for the season
— despite it being a morbid hope —
and the future of the team. And
wouldn’t it be great if next season

results in a lockout and a salary cap in -—

the NHL? Penguins fans everywhere

should dance in the streets.

Competitive team, here we come!
But let’s not think about that now.

Instead, let’s focus on the task at hand '

.— securing the N o. 1 pick in the draft,

“as much as that’s possible. It should

be an easy thing to do, with the
Rangers and Capitals in the hunt for
that pick, and Ovechkin. Cheering for

‘and Watching the Pens beat down on

those two teams — despite their bloat-
ed payrolls —- is one of the best things
about being a Penguins fan.

Pitt defensive tackle Vince Crochunis pounces on the opponent. Crochunis is one
of three returning starters from last season’s defensive line.

Experienced defensive line dominates
less experienced offensive line

Football, page 17 ’

the starting position, but neither he nor
the other running backs played very
well on Thursday.

’ “ [The running backs] are not run-
ning very good; they didn’t run very
hard. They didn’t turn it up, they ran to
the boundary, and they have been very
hesitant,” Harris continued, “When that
happens, we get nothing out of the run-
ning game.”

Perhaps the reason for the strug-
gling offensive line is the experienced
defense. On the defensive line, only one
of last year’s starters is departing —
Claude Harriott, who may be drafted at
the end of April in the National Football
League draft. Returning are the other
three starters on the defensive line, Dan
Stephens, Vince Crochunis and Thomas
Smith. Those three, along with a back
seven that has received signiﬁcantly
more playing time than the young
offense, can make for an unlevel playing

' ﬁeld.

On Thursday, the defense dominat-
ed most of the short scrimmage and held
the offense to "three ﬁeld goal attempts.
Two of the ﬁeld goal attempts were
good, and the third was blocked. The
only big play that the offense was able

to muster was a 60-yard bomb from
quarterback Luke Getsy to wide receiv-
er Greg Lee. The play set up the first
ﬁeld goal attempt, which was blocked
by defensive back Josh Lay.

The defensive line seems to make
the difference by controlling the line of
scrimmage. “It is still hard to tell where

the defensive line is; they are doing a “

disruptive job. Yet they have not been
tested by the offense,” Harris said.

The defensive line was helped by a
linebacking corps that is improving
every day. After losing Lewis Moore to
graduation, the other two starters,
Malcolm Postell and Brian Bennett,
remain. Besides those two players, two
others started and played a signiﬁcant
time at linebacker, J .J . Home and H.B.
Blades. This returning crew, accompa-
nied by Clint Sessions,has been playing
extremely well this spring. “They are
playing better, but need to keep working
on their technique, yet theoffense is still

not testing these guys either,” Harris‘

said.

The Panthers return to practice
today at 3:40 p.m., and will also practice
on Saturday at 10 a.m. They will then be
off till next Tuesday, which all leads up
to the spring game Saturday, April 10th!
at 1 p.m. at Heinz Field.
