Raising A bar since 1906

VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 71

ERIK ARROYO
The Pitt News»

Two years ago, the National Security Commission
warned that Americans would endure a devastating
tragedy ontheir own soil. ‘ . _

Henry S. Scharpenberg, former chief of staﬂ for the
recently disbanded U.S. Commission on National

e Security/21st Century, said that the commission was

right.
At a lecture on national security yesterday in the

Masonic Temple, Scharpenberg discussed the key ﬁnd-.

ings, objectives and recommendations of the corr1Inis-
sion. The council separated in July, when a federal gov-
ernment provision allowing for its formation expired.
Scharpenberg said that the national security commis-
sion focused on three primary goals: to describe the world
in societal, technological and economic terms, to deﬁne

an appropriate national security strategy and to assess 0

existing security structures and recommend changes.
a He said that the key findings of the group — origi-

nally disregarded by government oﬂicials — now have L

become essential to terrorism prevention. .
“Not many people listened in 1999,” he said. “But
after Sept. 11, government is looking for us to elaborate
on what was said two years prior.” ‘ , .
The commission warned that America would be
increasingly vulnerable to hostile attacks and that

advances in information and biotechnologies would .cre- ’

ate those vulnerabilities, Scharpenberg said. The mem-
bers also said that the sovereignty of the states would be
tested and that it would endure.

Scharpenberg outlined the commission’s objectives,

cohesion, economic competitiveness and military
strength, and promote dynamism of a new global econo-
my. He said, “the number one goal was to defend the
United States.” ..

4- According to Scharpenberg, the commission’s
researchers discovered a false sense of security in the
nation’s public.

“Few us of had a sense of concern, anxiety and stress
before Sept. 11,” he said. “But it is present now. It’s not
something that should govern our lives, but it is some-
thing we should be aware of.”

Scharpenberg said that before Americans place their

conﬁdence in the homeland defense’ system, changes

must occur. , .

“Gov. Ridge was appointed to the Ofﬁce of
Homeland Security,” he said. “He has a staff of 100, but
in effect, he controls nothing.” ' ‘

He said that there is “no central‘ authority giving $2
billion to provide prevention against bioterrorism, or
$200 billion to provide against cyberterrorism. Right
now, a lot of different people are doing a lot of diﬂerent
things.”

‘Scharpenberg said he would like to see better com-
munication between defense departments and more
appropriate allocation of resources. The comrnission’s
recommendations for an improved homeland security
system called for clear strategic direction, the establish-
ment codes of responsibility and the preservation of
Constitutional freedom. ‘

“Someone has to be in charge,” he said. “They’ve got
to ﬁgure out what the threat. is, where the appropriate
response investment should be placed, and how to estab-
lish lines of communications.”

On Sept. 9, 2000, a ‘bomb
exploded at a Downtown trolley
stop. -- *

No, not terrorism, but a drill.

There was no bomb. No one was

' hurt and Pittsburgh was able to mea-

sure its preparedness for an attack
involving mass casualties.

A small group of people gath-
ered last night in the Assembly
Room in the William Pitt Union to
find out if Pittsburgh is ready for a
disaster. Emergency Operations
Supervisor for the City of
Pittsburgh, Ray DeMich-ei, spoke
about what Pittsburgh hasldone to

Pittsburgh has done to prepare for
an incident involving-mass casual-
ties.

After two years of planning with
the federal government, Pittsburgh
conducted the September 2000 drill,

a simulation of a terrorist attack at a‘

Downtown.“T” stop. -

According to DeMichei, a few
of the main objectives of the simu-
lation were to asses the alert and
notification process for emergency
workers, asses the ability of hospi-
tals to manage mass disaster casual-
ties, and to demonstrate knowledge
of mass destruction contamination

control.

The drill began at 9 a.m. when
the simulated bomb exploded at the

medical services, fire, and haz-

ardous materials crews responded to-
the scene. DeMichei said that in.

order to avoid traffic accidents and
other hazards created by the many
rescue crews rushinglthrough the
streets, the crews used a simulated
response instead of a real -time
response. Cre_ws waited nearby and
were released gradually after the
initial notification. '
When respondents arrived at the
scene they found approximately 150
victim actors scattered, on the
ground and running through the
streets. Finding the actors proved

the biggest challenge, according to

DeMichei.

Pitt Club dinner theater

hosts 1940s-

MELANIE DONAHOO
Staff Writer

A man was beaten to death with a
decorative candy cane on Friday night

But it was all part of the show.

Mystery’s Most Wanted, a Pittsburgh-
based interactive dinner theater company,
performed its 1940s-era murder mystery
thriller, “Sleigh Bells Over Broadway,” at
the Pitt Club on Friday night. According to

Pitt Club Manager Madeline Gamble, the V

troupe was brought back this year because
of the feedback she received after last
year’s show.

“They performed here last year and
everyone wanted to know when tl1ey’d be
back,” she said. “The audience enjoyed
the theme [of Christmas] and how the

. actors worked it into the show.” -

At a cost of $14 for dinner and the
show, alumni, faculty and staff were treat-

_ed to a detective thriller, complete with a‘

fedora—wearing private eye and a Viva-
cious, "leggy lounge singer.

The play centered on Elliot Brick,
“private dick,” and Annie Motts, his girl
Friday.

“Through my door danced a deli-
cious—looking dame,” Brick said. “She
had legs all the way up to her hips.”

That’s Dame Loretta La Diva to be ‘

exact. Once the queen of the stage and
screen, her career has been on the skids for

the last 10 years thanks to her agent,’

Ebenezer Screw. 1

La Diva hires Brick to ﬁnd the dirt on
Screw so she can get out of her contract.
To ﬁnd out more, Brick pays a visit to the
Sherbert Theater, home of . Screw
Productions. There he meets Candy Cane,
a singer who “put the ‘Va’ in Va-voom.”

“Watching Miss _Cane sing and dance
made me realize how much ﬁm it is to be
a man,” Brick said. “And how important it
is to have a notebook on your lap at all
times.” ‘

era mystery

But Miss Cane has problems of her
own. Posing as Annie Motts to earn extra
money for her dead sister’s children, she
also would like to get out of her contract
with Screw.

Enter Sir John Feelgood, a closeted

British homosexual who is blackmailed '

into signing his contract with Screw.°
Embarrassed by the poor roles Screw has
given him, he too would like to see the
man dead.

“Screw, you are an evil, diabolical,
poopyhead,” Feelgood said.

Given all the people who hate him,
it’s no surprise when Screw turns up dead,
a victim of a giant prop candy cane from
his own show. ’

After much ﬁnger pointing, it was up
to the audience to solve this mystery. The
characters gave a short question and
answer session in which the gumshoes
tried to get the dirt on the players.

Kevin Oprishko, who works at the
Pitt Club, said that although he was too
busy waiting on people to catch the whole
show, he didn’t miss the sexual innuendo.

“When _you’re not paying attention
it’s amusing to hear these things ﬂying
around,” he said. “Like the guy who kept
saying, ‘private dic .”’

Brick’s reply to the audience’s laugh- a
ter at the mention of his profession was,
“Get your mind out of the gutter.”

Audience members wrote down
whom they suspected and the reason why
on papers thatwere collected and mocked
by the players. '

Eventually the mystery was solved,
the murderer captured and all was well for
the remaining characters. The troupe gave
prizes to audience members for “dumbest
answer” and “most interesting answer.”
But the “super sleuth” of the night
received a certiﬁcate and trophy. '

“Congratulations,” Brick said, hand-
ing the winner her trophy. “We’ H need that
back after the show.”

“No nation is more vulnerable, or has
more to lose, than the U.S.,” he said.
“We’ve heard a lot about bioterrorism.
But what happens if a very proﬁcient
hacker shuts down the air trafﬁc control
system of the entire nation on a foggy
morning? I think you’ll have more serious

actions to one another.

DeMichei said the exercise
proved to him that though
Pittsburgh did fairly well “more
exercises are needed of this type.”

Communication of all sorts was
one of the largest problems during
the exercise.

“We do not have a good alert
system anywhere for a city,”
DeMichei said, stressing that if
there is a disaster, it might take
longer than necessary to notify both

rescue workers and the public.

DeMichei said that a few years
ago companies considered the idea
of placing a chip in televisions to
help notify people in the event of a
disaster. The chip would be-
installed in the television and would
turn it on whenever a radio alert is
issued.

City officials have also tossed
around the idea of a radio that
would act like a smoke detector,
remaining inactive unless -a warning
was issued. a -

Neither the chip nor the
advanced radio system is in place at
thistime.

The plan for the future is to’ho1d
another drill similar to the simulat-
ed bombing. But first the city must
devise solutions to the previous
problems and see if they work.

DeMichei said that one positive
consequence of the recent attacks is
that the city realizes the importance
of funding more drills to measure
emergency response preparedness.

‘ “I was worried about funding
but not anymore,” DeMichei said.
“Since Sept. 11 there is more
money to throw at it.” ‘

increase. ,

He said Americans “must give gov-
ernment the capability to monitor what
goes on” daily, but that the government
must resist “bureaucratic inertia,” a move-
ment that pushes for institutional reforms
in the wake of a national tragedy.

He said that if the necessary changes I

are made, and a commitment is made to
stand by those changes, national security
will improve and continue to do so.

. “If we coordinate and plan and com-
municate,” he said, “we can tie them
together and make the best use of our

- resources to respond to current and future '

terrorist threats.”

Remembering neighbors A
during the holiday season

Thanksgiving is traditionally a time
to count the things for which we are
thankful — our families, friends and
other blessings. It is also traditional to
express thankfulness and holiday cheer
by giving time and funds to charities.

The giving season started early this
year as a result of the Sept. 11 tragedies.
Since then, Americans have been espe-
cially generous, donating large amounts
of money, time and blood to the national
cause. But we must not neglect local
need, particularly in the holiday season.

Much of the money that people might
have normally allocated to local charities
has been diverted to national organiza-
tions for Sept. 11 relief. This has left the
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food
Bank with its greatest need since the local
steel industry collapse, according to Joyce
Rothennel, the food bank’s executive

director, according to a story in‘

Saturday’s Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.
Whereas the warehouse at‘ the food
bank’s headquarters in Duquesne usually
holds a tl1ree—month supply, the supply on
hand is currently only enough for one
month.

The food bank distributes a million
pounds of food a month, through 350
food panties and related organizations, to
138,000 households in 11 counties in
Southwestern Pennsylvania.

Take a minute and consider how
many people the food bank helps to feed.
Also remember that a lot of the people
receiving aid are not who you. might
expect. Many are children under 17 years
old. Many are the working poor, people
between jobs or single—parent households.

Sodexho, Pitt’s campus dining ser-
vices provider, is to be applauded for con-
tinuing its food drive efforts again this
year. From Nov. 12 through Dec. 12,
Sodexho is sponsoring two programs that
allow students to help give to the hungry.
Caring Cans allows students to deposit
non-perishable food items in receptacles
located in campus eateries. And rather
than stockpiling cases of fruit juice with
their remaining blocks, students can
donate them to Hunger Blocks.

Campus organizations and individual
students should be similarly encouraged.
Campus groups can organize canned food
drives and collect funds for the food bank.
Also, students can utilize options provid-
ed by Sodexho or Student Volunteer
Outreach, which ‘often sponsors trips to
volunteer at the food bank.

So as you gather with friends and
family in the upcoming weeks, be grate-
ful for your blessings and be glad that
you’ve done your part to help fellow
community members have a joyful holi-
day season. *

Defining sexuality and power

Power. It’s a word that shouts from
headlines and resonates in eardrums. It
connotes authority, control and that ever-
elusive allure that draws people to some-
one, that vague and indeﬁnite attraction
that makes legends out of leaders and
myths out of mortals. Power’s appeal is
that many clamor after it, but few can
achieve it.

We all want a piece of the power pie. If
we don’t want to be the one in power, then

cleanliness. (Upon hearing this, my ﬁrst
thought was to scour the streets for the
dirty, dumb and ugly. Or not.)

This example implies that women
have more control over sex than men, but it

does not constitute a fonn of power.

Because women, who’ve been denied sta-
tus in the ﬁelds listed above, could not use

’ whether it was simply factual-

  tribunals deny civil rights,  

principles of the American justice system

Our justice system is based on several
important principles. When you are accused
of a crinre, you are innocent until proven
guilty. You have the right to confront all wit-
nesses against you. You have the right to a
public trial so that the community can mon-
itor its goverr1rnent’s actions. You have the
right to a trial by a jury of your peers. You
have the right to have counsel assist in your
defense.

The defendants would come from a list
of suspected terrorists approved by the pres-
ident.

New York Times columnist William
Saﬁre, known‘ for his conservative views,
rightly calls these tribunals “military kanga-
roo courts.” They will be conducted sepa-
rately ﬁom the judicial branch, with the pres-
ident having ﬁnal authority. To quote Saﬁre

would receive “a fair trial,” but
that, at the same time, they

Bush signed an executive
order authorizing the creation
of military tribunals to try terrorism suspects
-— but only those who are non-citizens.

In doing so, he, like other leaders
throughout the world who suspended basic
civil liberties at one time or another, cited
national security as a reason. .

While the United States conducted tri-
bunals during wars, this is the ﬁrst time that
it could use a tribunal for crimes committed
during what is technically peacetime. For
example, they could try Osama bin Laden
for the Sept. 11 attacks as well as ones that
took place before that.

They would be conducted differently
from normal criminal trials. They would
likely take place outside the United States.

They also would deny the accused the
basic rights we take for granted. They would
call for a lesser burden of proof ——_- the pros-
ecution would not have to prove guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt.

While normal criminal trials require a
unanimous jury vote to convict, the tribunals
would require only a two-thirds vote of the

. judges for convictions and death sentences.

They would have less strict rules of evi-
dence. Even hearsay, typically inadmissible
in normal American court proceedings,
would be admissible. The accused would
also not have the ability to confront the evi-
dence against him or her. V

The trials would happen in secret, away
from the scrutiny of the public or the media.

mal judicial process.”
In other words, Cheney

deﬁnes a fair trial dilferently than our justice '

system does. _ '

Defenders of the tribunals argue that
civilian juries in the United States would
face unnecessary danger in terrorist trials.
They are right.

But convening military tribunals is not
the solution to this problem. Rather, an inter-
national tribunal would both’ protect
American juries and the interests of justice.

Opponents of this idea would argue that
the crimes were committed against the
United States and so American courts should
conduct the trials.

Butthe crimes were against humanity,
on the level of mass murders in the Balkans
in the last decade. Many of those cases,
including against former Yugoslav President

Slobodan Milosevic, are now pending

before an international, United Nations-
created panel in The Hague, Netherlands.

One could easily argue that
Milosevic’s crimes were . ,,
against Bosnians, Croats H
and Kosovars and, as such, 3 ,
he should face trial in those ,
places. But the international 5 _ _
community says they are ' 
crimes against huma_nity.

An international tri-
bunal, with all the legal safeguards,
would be warranted here as well. If
Osarrra bin Laden were tried in secret, the

-

American public would not have the satis-
faction of seeing its tonnentor humbled as a
prisoner.

Israel provides a ﬁne example of tem-
pering the sword of vengeance. The coun-
try’s laws allow capital punishment only for
Nazi war  It has passed down two
death sentences in its 53-year history and
only carried out one. A

In 1962, Israel executed Adolf
Eichmann for his role as mastermind of the
Final Solution -— but only after a nine-
month trial. The state afforded him all the
protections a defendant should receive,
including the right to counsel of his choice at

_ Israel’s expense, the right to confront the wit— '

nesses against him and the right to a public
trial.

Eight years ago, it did the same in the
case of John Demjanuk. In 1986, the United
States extradited the Ukrainian man to -Israel
to face trial as the notorious Treblinka death
camp guard “Ivan the Terrible.” He was con-
victed and sentenced todeath in 1988. But

‘Israel allowed him to appeal, and in the end

its Supreme Court ruled that reasonable
doubt existed that Demj anuk was ‘ ‘Ivan” and
thus released  I

In both cases, the Jewish State was will-
ing to stayits lust to avenge the deaths of 
million Jews to allow justice to take its
course.

Why can’t the United States do the  

same?

Localband deals with
the Pagewater “curse”  

JENNIFER MATSON
Staff Writer

One by one, the clubs where the band
Pagewater regularly played closed —— ﬁrst
Pluto’s, then Graﬂiti and then the Beehive.
The lead singer got beaten up and mugged.
A light bulb broke during a’-performance at
Nick’s Fat City. And then there were audio
problems. -

“We have the Pagewater curse,” gui-

‘ tarist Steven Stiller said, “Undoubtedly,

something drastically will go wrong.”

But setbacks havenot bro-
ken the local band up even after
six years of playing together.
Nor have they stopped faithful
listeners from  to their
shows. Twice a month, Pagewater performs
at Nick’s Fat.City. ’

“It’s hard to be a startup band. There’s‘ a
lot of interest, but the industry is taken up by
dance clubs, and rock bands-have suffered;”
Stiller said .

Enrique wants to be your hero

Escape
Enrique Iglesias
Interscope

CLARE PERRETTA
Contributing Editor -

Enrique Iglesias fancies himself quite the sex machine.

In thetitlettrack of his newest album Escape, he brags, -
“You can run/you can hide/but you can’t escape my love.”
The fourth track and first single, “Hero,” queries, “Would
you tremble if I touched your lips?” and boasts, “I can be
your hero, baby.” He demonstrates how manly and sensi-
tive he is in “One Night Stand” when even though “She left
her underwear and her perfume,” he’s “trying hard not to
feel rejected.” He gets a little sadomasochistic in the George
Michael-inﬂuenced “Love to See You Cry” when he

swoons, “The sweetest pleasure is pain.”

So why does he complain in the press material for
Escape that the “Latin lover” tag. is “tackyand embarrass-

o

mg?”

Besides Stiller, a Pitt graduate, the band
members, including vocalist and guitarist
Kevin Facer, bassist and vocalist Evan
Davies and drummer Jason Godek see

themselves as self-sufficient. Pagewater is in-

charge of everything ﬁom creating its own
Web site to setting up its own sound system.

Each of the songs on the, band’s latest,
three-track EP Potential Energy is adrena-
line-charged. It serves as a‘prelude to their
upcoming album Kinetic that’s to be
released next spring. The sound is heavy,'but
Stiller explained, “It’s optimistic. Our band
is not a dark band. [Facer, the lyricist] takes
a story that bothers him and gives a message
of hope.”

In the song “. . .And I Reply,” a heavy
drum beat and cymbals combine with bass
and electric guitar to produce a rock song

minus a pop inﬂuence. Facer’s
' voice is in tune, deep and pas-

sionate, but strained from belt-

ing out the lyrics. “Better Than
- This” contains some cool guitar
rifts and interesting lyrics. It sounds deep
and disturbed, but not scary. “Catalyst” starts
off slow, too. But during the refrain, drums
roll aroundtocreatearhythmthatismore
likelytomakeheadsbobtothebeatthan
“Better Than This.”

would think he would exer-

cise more creative control
over an album of songs —
all penned by Iglesias —
that are a testament to his
super-suave image.

_ If you ignore the evi-
dent hypocrisy, Iglesias’s
new album is full of fun,
sexy songs with musical ref-
erences ranging from arena
rock to disco to the bleeps
and boops of electronica.

' In the second song,
“Don’tTum Off the Lights,”
whichhasbizarreriﬁs remi-
niscent of Whitesnake’s
magnum opus “Here I Go
Again” running through it, a
charming acoustic guitar
intro makes way for a slew
of Casio keyboard-synthe-
sized heavy-metal chords.
Despite the Freddie
Mercury;esque shrieks in

the outro, it’s the album’s most compelling track.

Just as the album title suggests,
Pagewater has a lot of potential. Those who
enjoy upbeat, surmy songs shouldn’t count
on ﬁnding any at Pagewater’s shows.

I But for those who like ‘mosh pits and

solid rock, be certain to pay Pagewater a
visit. According to Stiller, playing live for an

\

audience is his favorite part of being in a
band. v

“When you see people singing along,”
he said, “when someone comes up to you
and says, ‘we enjoy coming to your shows
and we get what you’re saying’... there’s
nothing like winning people over like that.”

Since Iglesitasassurned the role of executive producer reason. Asyrupy ballad, full of lush string arrangements and
on this — his ‘second English-language release —— one introspective pianoand guitar, Iglesias’ voice runs from a

whimpered “I just want to hold you”
to Wembley Stadium dynamics on
his big line, ‘ﬁnd I willlstand by
you/forever.” It’s truly more impres-
sive when he sings it than written on
the page.

' The video for “Hero” also
deserves to be mentioned. Joseph
Kahn, who directed Brandy and
Monica’s ‘The Boy is ,Mine,” for
which he won a-MTV Video Music
Award, directs an unintentionally
hilarious clip that stars Jemrifer Love
Hewitt as Iglesias’ blushing bride and
partner in crime. Mickey Rourke,
ﬂreir patmchy antagonist, roughs up
Iglesias outside the -dusty desert
church at which he. and Hewitt
declare their eternal -love. It’s like a
Latin-ﬂavored version of R. Ke1ly’s
classic “Down Low.”

Escape is not a particularly good
album. It is neither ‘a technical mas-
terpiece nor  it emotionally pro-
found. But what he lacks in depth,

Iglesias more than  up for in enthusiasm: his sincere
‘- err)” is the ﬁrst single from Escape. By now, you’ve desire that he would like-to sing songs for you and

He’s done it again. Give R. L.
“Burnside a rhythm guitar, a bottle of
whiskey and an open mic and he’ll
explode your sense of the blues.

R. L. Bumside’s ﬁrst live album,
Burnside. on Burnside, was released
Oct. 23‘ on the Oxford, Mississippi-
based Fat Possum Records. The album,
recorded at Portland, Ore.’s famous

Crystal Ballroom on Burnside Street in .

January, gives devoted fans that have
not seen the dynamic blues man per-
form live a taste of Burnsidefs down-
home energy onstage.

Burnside, whose career spans ﬁve
decades, has seen and heard it all. While
listening to the 12-track album, you can
almost picture Burnside even if you’ve
never seen a photograph‘ of the blues
legend. He’s the wrinkled’ old man in

the comer of a shady Mississippi juke.

joint, a bottle of the sauce in onephand
and a sweet-smelling woman on his lap.
He’s the man with the one—liners and
raunchy stories of the good ol’ days in
the Southern backwoods. He‘ can be
witty, he can be smart, and he can play
the guitar like nobody’s business.

The 74-year-old Burnside isn’t
stuck in the past, though. His gritty
tunes often have a contemporary ﬂair.
Beck’s producer re-mixed Bumside’s
Come On In album, MTV aired his
radio hit, “Let My Baby Ride,” on “l20
Minutes,” and HBO’s “The Sopranos”
included two of Bumside’s tunes on the
series’ -soundtrack.

ment and smoothness of a studio album,

tiness that only a blues album can get
away with. , _ . V.  I

In. between -traditional songs like
“Rollin’_ and Tumblin”? and “Walkin’
Blues,” Burnside sprinkles some of the
best’ songs from his extensive reper-
toire. Highlights include the album’s
foot-stomping opening track, “Shake
‘Em On Down” and “Alice Mae,” a
song written about Bumside’s wife of
more than 50 years.

Listeners also get a taste of
Bumside’s blunt humor and onstage
commentary. After the track, “Long-
Haired Doney,” Burnside tells the audi-
ence, “Something is kinda hot under
these lights; Gonna bring me up a little
tomato juice, you know, to kind of cool
off. “Cause after tonight, I’m not gonna
drink anymore unless I’m by myself or
either with somebody.” ~

Bumside’s voice is like a steamboat
—— loud and powerful. He controls his
whistling and howling guitar like he’s
steering through the muddy waters of
the. Mississippi. He can make it whine

‘one minute and swoon the next.

The I live_ album also features

Lit- down 

The sophomore jinx can be a killer. Since hardly
anyone has heard ‘of their ﬁrst album, Tripping the
Light Fantastic, most will regard Atomic as Lit’s sec-
ond because their last release was so popular.
Regardless, the sophomore jinx is alive and well here
because 1999’s A Place in the Sun is a really tough act
to follow. Strangely, Lit only has itself to blame. Sun
was too good. ' V V

Not everyone gets to be on a soundtrack. Lit got
to do more than-that. The band practically wrote the
soundtrack to the summer of 1999. “My Own Worst
Enemy” rode high on the airwaves for months-..and
“Zip—Lock,” “Miserable” and “Four” got to grab its
coattails. ' ~

Now the fall release of Atomic leaves a little more
to be desired. Sun was a smooth summer marvel.

stocked on shelves next to Halloween decorations.
The songs don-’t snap, crackle and pop like Lit’s pre-
vious hits. . - . .
The ﬁrst single, “Lipstick and Bruises,” is the
purest radio hit on the album and it doesn’t even have
the power of the third single from Sun. The problem
with Atomic isn’t so much that it’s bad, it’s just that
it’s a letdown.‘ Finding your place in the sun was
apparently a lot harder than it looked two years ago.

Despite the fact that ‘it’s inferior, Atomic still gets

to rock out on a few tracks. Two of them used major

motion pictures as springboards. “American Pie 2” ’

used “The’First Time Again” as background music
and “Over My Head” appeared incommercials for the
ﬁlm “Titan,A.E.” The fact that the first two movies
provided hype for those songs will help their familiar-
ity levels. “Everything’s Cool” best captures Lit’s

‘ ability to make smart and catchy hooks and is remi-

niscent of Sun material. I v A
Unfortunately, most of Atomic’s other offerings

sound a little too much like ﬁller in between its good

songs. They try a few of the lyrical tricks that made

Sun _so good, but they don’t work as well here. Sun_

really shined.Atomic just seems a bit too dim.

LISTEN

Everything is everything

  People Are Moving

Everything ’
Full Tube Records
viksik

A band that calls itself Everything has
chutzpah. One would expect a band with
this name to do everything —- play a zillion
instruments (expertly of course), tap every
musical genre and hybrid in existence, and
throw out insightful, witty lyrics about,
well, everything.

The four mainmembers of Everything
have mastered the part about the zillion
instruments. In addition to the usual guitars,

. bass and drums, the band also plays with

Mellotron and Casio synthesizers, key-
boards, samplers, congas, Saxophones,
piano and organ, mostly courtesy of multi-
instrumentalist Steve Van Dam. Even string
arrangements and a brass section ﬁnd their
way into Everything’s newest release,
People Are Moving,

Surprisingly, this wild assortment of
instruments rarely translates into memo-
rable moments. The band is quite good at
harmnering out a danceable mid—tempo
rhythm, but they neglect to provide any

'~ exciting backdrop to the beats. Other than

the folksy ballad “Chime” and the excellent

1 action and good times” and “When you start

‘ ments than a typical Top 40_band Their

drurn—and—bass ﬂavored “No End to Loving .
Days,” no other track stands out. The lack of _
change throughout People Are Moving is
disappointing compared to their catchier
and more varied 1998 album Super
Natural.

The lack of variation extends to the
lyrics as well. Song titles like “People Are
Moving,” “Wheels of Steel,” and “Get Your
Groove On” should dispel any doubts as to
what vocalist Craig Honeycutt likes to sing
about: dancing, club—hopping, relationships
and more dancing. Digging further into his
words yields cliches like “Looking for some

your falling down/I’ll be holding on.”

Everything even recycles some of
the lyrics and music from opening song “To
the Lust of the Light” into a sample on “Sir
Nasty,” almost midway through the album.
Maybe Everything really wants to know if
you are as “nasty as you wanna be” —_ or
maybe they just ran out of ideas.

At the core, Everything is just a
pop group that can play a few more iI1stru-

feel-‘good lyrics and harmless, overpro-
duced “mainstream sound” practically
guarantee the band a spot in the next block-
buster movie soundtrack. But look beneath
the surface of their music and Everything is
nothing but groove. .

sort of underlying message serving as motivation. This
ranges from preaching for the end of the commercial
destruction of the Rocky Mountains to existing as a

correctness. Intense themes such as these are seldom
approached in this musical era and for many listeners
could provide a welcome outlet from pop entertainers

 

Veterans of the small concert venue, New York
band Freeloader emerges onto the music scene with
the release of its debut album Custom/I0. With their
original and thoughtful lyrics, combined with an
earthy, old-school style, Custom/I0 should earn
Freeloader a valid chance to open for bigger name
rock bands in the future. ,

Although most of the songs on CustonV10 lack
musical diversity, greener pastures are not unforesee-
able in the future as the band generates more experi-
ence relating to their target audience, and if they are
offered a contract with a popular record label. Unlike
most other bands that strive for recognition,
Freeloader possesses the rare potential to mature into
a rock band among the likes of "The Clarks or
Collective Soul. '

The majority of Custom/10's songs carry some

like Destiny’s Child or the Backstreet Boys.

As he was growing up, Freeloader’s lead singer,
Scott‘ Sinclair, was strongly inﬂuenced by jazz music.
Sinclair, who considers legendary jazz musician Miles
Davis the primary inﬂuence in his music, incorporates
this relaxed, timeless style throughout the tracks on
Custom/I0. j

Sinclair, a graduate of the University of Virginia
and Stanford, .forrned Freeloader in April 1999. A
model of dedication, Sinclair even left his job as .a
media analyst in order to devote his time to helping his
band generate more recognition.

Despite the burden of inexperience, Freeloader is

a solid band whose music should not be overlooked. "

Freeloader exhibits great potential to succeed with
their debut album. , ‘ -

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

Pitt gearing up for
Backyard Brawl  

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Two years ago West Virginia destroyed
the Panthers’ bowl bid with a 52-51 win in
Morgantown. 1

Last year, the Panthers clinched a berth
in the Insightcom Bowl with a win, 38-28

over the Mountaineers at Three Rivers
_ Stadium.

This year, the Panthers go to
Mountaineer Field with a chance to keep
their bowl bid alive and get back to .500.

This is a rivalry. This is the Backyard
Brawl.

‘They hate us, we hate them. Plain and
simple,” defensive end Bryan Knight said.

On Saturday, the 94th meeting
between Pitt and West Virginia will take
place at Mountaineer Field in Morgantown,

WVa. Pitt holds a slight edge r57—33—3‘
against the Mountaineers all time. This will "

be the 59th consecutive year these two
teams will play, and it is the longest lasting
rivalry game in the Big East Conference.
Both teams will be coming into
Saturday’s game on a different roller coast-
er of emotions. The Mountaineers, after
going 7-4 last year, are off to a 3-7 start and

lost to Temple 17-14 at home, last week-
end.

“We just didn’-t play well,” West
Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez said.
“I hope we refocus this week for our 18
seniors, for their senior day.”

_ On the other side, the Panthers have
won three games in a row over Temple,
Virginia Tech and Rutgers, and, in order to

keep their bowl hopes alive, they have to

beat West Virginia Saturday. In those three
games, the Panthers outscored their oppo-
nents 113-14. Last weekend, the Panthers
received a bye week. The week off was a

(double-edged sword.

.“[The bye week has] been good
because we got healthier,” Harris said.
“But; it’s been no good because we didn’t
play last week We were playing well, and
there is no guarantee we will keep playing
weH.” A

West Virginia enters the Backyard
Brawl with one of the nation’s elite running
backs in Avon Coboume. Coboume ranks
113th in the nation and second in the'Big
East in rushing (123.4 yards per game.)

While the Panthers go into Saturday

ond best passing game (220 yards per
game), the Mountaineers respond with the

nation’s best pass defense, allowing only .

122.2 yards per’garne in the air.

The hot hand sizzling into
Mountaineer Stadium is Pitt wide receiver
Antonio Bryant, who has 10 catches for
200 yards and ﬁve touchdowns over the
Panthers three-game win streak.

This Backyard Brawl is Rodriguez’
ﬁrst as head coach. Rodriguez was an assis-
tant behind former Mountaineer coach Don

Nehlen and also played for West Virginia in -

the l98(ls. For Rodriguez, this game brings 1

back lots of memories.

“As a player weplayed this game early ,

in the season,” Rodriguez recalls. “There
were bonﬁres, and  It was a red-letter
game. When I played, each game was on

national television because Pitt had Dan L

Marino.” . ,
Saturday’s game begins at noon and is

“They are our main rival now,” Harris
said. “It adds even more excitement to the

rivalry.”

 

Men’s team stays undefeated over weekend

If you stopped by Trees Hall last weekend, you may
have heard some hissin’ and growlin’ coming from the
pool area. . -

At the Pittsburgh Invitational the Missouri Tigers
proved to be the toughest competition for the Panthers’
swimming and diving teams. The men’s team won the
invitational, beating the second-place Missouri team by
522 points, but the Tigers had the upper hand with the
Panther women, who came in second, by a margin of 527
points.

Overall, the Panthers had an exceptional meet with a
number of season- and lifetime-best swims. Two Pitt team
records also fell at Trees Pool, achieved by sophomore
Carolyne Savini in the 200-yard backstroke, with a time of

Along with her ﬁrst place ﬁnish in the 100 breast
stroke, Redman joined her teammates Savini, Kelli
Tielking, and Jenny Livingstone, to the 200-yard
medley relay (1 :43.96). The same group placed second in
the 400-yard medley relay.

Panthers tie up Virginia Military Institute  

Tuesday, November 20, 2001

~ KEVIN NASH j 1 , ‘

Staff Writer

Takedowns and controlling the match
from the neutral position proved to be the
key to Pitt’s success against Virginia
Military Institute.

Starting at Shawn Amistade’s match
and through Mike May’s match, all of the
Panthers who were victorious dominated
their opponents in the neutral position.

Amistade started the Panthers off
with an 8-2 decision over the Keydets’
Oliver Ruiz.

“We needed somebody to go out and
win for us,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. ‘

The Keydets came right back with
Mark DiSalvo decisioning Blaise Mucci.
DiSalvo dominated the match in the neu-
tral position.

The Panthers recaptured the lead on
one of the better matches of the night.
Pitt’s Rich Boden was losing to VMI’s
Mike Parsons 4—l going into the third peri-
od, but two takedowns in the ﬁnal minute
of the period sent the match into overtime.
VV1th three seconds left in overtime Boden
got a takedown to win the match.

Boden was one of three wrestlers ﬁll-
ing in at weight classes for the night. Rob
Blackiﬁlled in for Matt Catullo at 174
pounds and Donald Rush ﬁlled in for
Zach Doll at 157 pounds.

“All of the ﬁll—ins did great, especial-
ly Boden winning in the last three seconds
of overtime,” Stottlemyer said. “I felt it
changed the momentum [of the match].”

The score was tied at six going into
the l57—pound match, where Adam Britt
of V1VlI defeated Rush 5-2.

The Panthers again reclaimed the lead
on a Carl Fronhofer 12-4 major decision
over the Keydets’ Shannon Meehan, but

the Keydets came right back and tied it at
10 with a Matt Erwin major decision over
Black.

The seesaw battle continued as the
Panthers again took the lead, after Dan
Stine’s 12-3 major decision over VMI’s
Jason Cox, which was followed by three
consecutive major decisions over the
Keydets by David Sandberg, Jacob
Lining, and May.

May, who is now 2-0 in his career in
dual meets, major decisioned VMI’s Juan
Sanchez, who pinned May last season.
May’s ﬁrst career dual meet win came
against Lehigh’s No. 12-ranked Mario
Stuart. ‘

“He [Mike] beat a returning All-
American,” Stottlemyer said. “He is a

mature kid and I think he will be focused
at the end of the year.”

The Panthers suffered a 29-6 loss to
No. 8—ranked Lehigh last Thursday night,
in the team’s opener. The meet led with
the heavyweights; Lininger faced off with
Lehigh’s Joe Sahl. Lininger pulled out a 9-
6 victory over Sahl.

May extended Pitt’s short-lived lead
with the 4-3 upset over~Stuart.

After May’s victory, it was downhill
for the Panthers as the Mountain Hawks’
Dan Hyman upset Amistade, by a score of
3-1. Amistade was ranked 18th going into
the match.

Lehigh’s Tommy Rohn major deci-
sioned Mucci, followed by his teammate
Mike Pirozzola’s pinning of Jim Mangan,

who was filling in at 149 pounds for the
injured NCAA qualiﬁer Justin Giovinco.

The Mountain Hawks’ 157—pound
Nate Cote gave his team a comfortable 10
point lead with his 9-4 decision over
Rush. .

The premiere match of the night was
at 165 pounds. Lehigh’s No. 4-ranked
Chris Vitale wrestled Pitt’s No. 9—ranked
Fronhofer. It was a close match as
promised, with Vitale edging Fronhofer 7-
5. Lehigh continued its dominance in the
last three matches, in which they had all
ranked wrestlers. ' A

“We improved from the other
[Thursday] night,” said Stottlemyer. “It
wasn’t a big step but a deﬁnite improve-
ment.” '

Women place second to Missouri at weekend meet 1

Wet Win, page 12

The men’s team as a whole showed remarkable

the 200 IM.

Limkemarm took his usual ﬁrst place spot in the 500

 

strength, winning all ﬁve relays and a number of individ-
ual events. The Panthers swam the 200 freestyle relay and
the 800 freestyle relay with times that ranked them ﬁrst in
the nation in both events.

The 200 freestyle relay team swam a time of 1:21.15
and was made up of Michael Demos, Max von Bodungen,
Adam Webber and Miah Heath. The 800 freestyle relay
team, who won the event with a time of 6:42.09, was com-
prised of Heath, Eric Limkemarm, Webber and Von
Bodungen.

Von Bodungen led the pack with individual wins in
the 100 freestyle (45.50) and 200 freestyle; his time of
1:38.97 in the 200-free earned him NCAA consideration.
Von Bodungen also placed second in the 200-yard butter-
ﬂy and 500 freestyle.

Randy Gertenbach had good early season swims in

’ the 100 breast stroke (56.49) and 200-yard breast stnoke

(2201.92) winning both events. He also placed second in

freestyle and 1650 freestyle events with times of 4:28.71
and 15:30.71 respectively. Limkemann also placed second
in the 400 M. .

In the 50-yard freestyle, Heath beat Demos by just 3
hundredths of a second and Steve Siler helped his fellow
Panthers with a win in the 200 backstroke (1:47.83). -

Head coach Chuck Knoles said he felt much more
prepared for the invitational than against Rutgers last
weekend, mainly because the team had rested for a few
days.

“Everyone is after us because of how well we are
rankedinthe country andItl1inktheteamdoesanespe-
cially good job of consistently swimming well under that
kind of pressure,” Knoles said.

Both men’s and women’s teams get back into their
regular workout schedule until January, when the women
host Harvard Jan. 5 and both teams travel to Morgantown,
W.Va., to take on the Mountaineers Jan. 12.
