New health insurance contract “weeks away”

itt is. still “a couple ’
of weeks away” -from
signing a new contract

- for employee health‘insurance,

according to Vice Chancellor
for Human‘ Resources Ronald
W. Frisch. ‘

“The negotiations [with
health insurers] have been going
slowly this year, the ‘slowest I’ve

i ever seen,” Frisch said this week.
“We keep pushing and pushing,
but we’re not there yet.”

Pitt’s exclusive contract with
UPMC Health Plan expiresJune
30. The University must sign a
new contract soon if it hopes to
distribute enrollment forms to
employees and get those forms_
returnfed-by the end of April.

“In previous years, we’ve sent
forms out in mid—March. Now
we’re pushing it to April,” Frisch

said. “We have to catch the faculty

said, but he wouldn’t identify
them. However, UPMC Health
Plan spokesperson Bill Sawchak
said his company is one of the

Neither Frisch nor Sawchak
would give any hints as to how
high Pitt’s premiums might jump

' Economics professor .Her—
bert Chesler, who serves on a
committee that is advising Pittls
administration‘ during the con-
tract negotiations, told Faculty

A Assembly last week; “We will

have a set of options, each with
hefty cost increases. We haven’t

any of these plans.

“There will be increases in
co-payments, ” Chesler said. “Our
prescription plan will change. It’s
going to cost us more, substan-
tially more.”

Chesler also told Faculty
Assembly that Pitt will drop
its Comprehensive‘ plan. Frisch
would not conﬁrm this, although
he noted that the Comprehen-
sive plan duplicates coverage
available under the University’s
current Point—of—Service plan for
subscribers who go outside the
plan’s physicians network,

Members of the advisory com-

they’ve been let A in on many

University Planning and Budget-

 Will lean year prompt creativity
in faculty & staff compensation?

hould the highest percent— -
age pay raises at Pitt next

year goto the University’s

lowest-paid employees (as they‘

did in 1996)? _

’ Would employees be better
off if Pitt paid a larger share of
their health insurance costs, in
lieu of salary increases?

Questions such as those are
expected to come up at meetings
of the University Planning and
Budgeting Committee (UPBC),
a group of faculty, staff and
administrators that advises Pitt’s
senior administration asit plans‘
each year’s budget.

VV1th Pitt bracing for another ,

lean budget year beginning July
1 — exacerbated by anticipated,
hefty hikes in the University’s
health insurance premiums
— some professors and staff are
suggesting that Pitt get more cre-
ative in allocatingwhat’s expected
to be a shallow pool of dollars for
compensation increases.

University Senate President
James Cassing Said, “I’m sure that
the issue of differential raises will
come up at UPBC as we get closer
to deciding how we’re going to
divvy up what meager amount of
salary raise money Pitt will have
to work with. There’s no reason
we can’t look at more creative
ways of spreading the money
around.”

Rich Colwell, the StaffAsso-

ciation Council’s vice president

for steering, said SAC members '

have been polling staff in their
units about compensation prefer-
ences for next year. “I told them

to look at everything as a whole: —

salaries, health care beneﬁts, to
see if staff want higher raises or
lower health care premiums,”
Colwell said. A

. Last fall, Colwell charged two
SAC committees with exploring
ideas for a “cafeteria—style” ben-

_ eﬁts plan that would give staff

more choice in selecting among
Pitt’s fringe beneﬁts.

Chancellor Mark A. N orden-
berg said it would be premature
for him to comment on such
notions until UPBC has vetted
them. But he noted: “Clearly,
there is going to be tension
between the dollars that we invest
for health care and the dollars that
are made available for the salary
increase pool. I think everybody
understands that. It’s going to
be an issue that we’ll have to
discuss.

“In terms of other unconven-
tional approaches [to compensa-

tion], nothing has bubbled up to -

me yet,” Nordenberg added. “To
my knowledge, there has not
yet been any serious consider-
ation of any different kinds of
approaches.”

At the Feb. 4 FacultyAssembly
meeting, the University Senate’s

immediate past president argued
for using a portion of next year’s

- salary funds to offset, ifnecessary,

increases in employees’ share of
health insurance costs. ‘
~ Nathan Hershey said such a

, move would help lower-income

employees in particular. “If
our health premiums were to

The group said it would draft

including recent staff layoffs,

staff, and instances of staff not

governance groups such as the

ing Committee, the University
Senate’s benefits and welfare
committee (which Chesler co-
chairs) and the Senate’s budget
policies committee have been
“kept in the dark about the likely
shape of things to come in Pitt
health insurance.

“And yet, somebody must be
very close to making decisions, if
they haven’t already been made,”

Chesler said. “_Come April 1, we’ll .

have the packages in our hands,
with the costs and with knowledge
of what our premiums will be for
the options that we select.”
Chesler emphasized that he
wasn’t criticizing negotiators
from Human Resources or Pitt’s

, health insurance consultants,

“who have been working very
hard and doing an excellent job
on behalf of the University.”

iAccording to Chesler, the
indicating that UPMC Health
Plan lost money on its current
deal with Pitt. “All of the projec-
tions [UPMC Health Plan] made

 

. turned out to be wrong,” Chesler

said. “It’s pretty clear from what’s
‘been presented to us that the cost
to UPMC —— that is, the claims

I that the health plan paid — has

far exceeded the premiums that
Pitt has paid.” P .

‘ Health Plan spokesperson
Sawchak said: “UPMC :Health

ness matters associated with any of

overall ﬁscal performance for the

To the editor:

Given recent events, it is
important to underline a few key
facts about the ongoing same-sex
partner beneﬁts debacle.

First, the University lectures
that litigation is not the appro-
priate way to resolve the issue.
VVhat it fails to note is that the
ACLU’s latest brief is a defensive
move. It responds to Pitt’s action
to have the temporary injunction
of Henson et al. vs. Uiziversity of
Pittsburg/9 made permanent.
Pitt’s aggressive tactics, further-
more, include a challenge to the
city’s very authority to legislate

To the editor:

Robert PerlofPs and Fred Bry-
ant’s pious defense of “diversity”
as opposed to “afﬁrmative action”
in the last issue (Jan. 23, 2003) of
the University Times (“...afﬁrma—
tive action is in effect znﬁrmative
action, an action that disenfran-
chises some white people, is not
fair, just or democratic”), ignores
the fact that white males in par-
ticular have been the beneﬁ-
ciaries of a massive afﬁrmative
action program that has been in
effect for centuries rather than
decades. It is called American
History, and it features the politi-
cal disenfranchisement ofwomen
until less than a century ago; the
dispossession, destruction or
forced relocation —— we would
call it today “ethnic cleansing”
—— of the indigenous peoples of
the continent; plantation slavery
followed by more than a century
of Jim Crow laws after the Civil
War; the conquest and reduction
to second—class citizenship of the
extensive pre-1848 population of
the Hispanic Southwest and Cali-
fornia; anti-immigrant prejudice,
then and now, directed against
Italians, Irish, Poles, Jews,
Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos,
Mexicans, Arab Americans...
(see Scorsese’s “Gangs of New
York). Universities, even private
ones, consume massive amounts
of public revenue. It is only
“fair” in that regard that they

A second confusion is about
the cost of awarding full ben-
eﬁts. An estimate of $1 million
ﬂoats about. However, Pitt’s
own internal estimates not long
ago were $25,000—$50,000 per
year (that is, in the range of the
chancellor’s recent raise). Higher
ﬁgures are about the cost across
several years. All of this, in any
case, is beside the point: The real-
life ﬁnancial cost to universities
that have made this commitment
to their employees has been, by
their own reporting, negligible.

However, $1 million is not an

provide those revenues. Hispan-
ics, according to the latest census,
constitute almost 14 percent of
the population of this country
(and perhaps 7 percent of the pop-
ulation of Pennsylvania), yet less
than 2 percent of the faculty at
Pitt are U.S. Hispanics. Despite
decades of initiatives, women are
still seriously underrepresented
in the ranks of tenured faculty, '
particularly in the natural sci-
ences. A little more afﬁrmative
action in these areas might not be
such a bad idea, it seems to me.
Perhaps “diversity” -— if it is to
be more than tokenism (“we have
one of them”) — in fact requires
“afﬁrmative action.”

VVilfried W. Daehnick, pro-
fessor emeritus in the Depart-
ment of Physics and Astronomy,
diedJan. 24, 2003. He was 74.

A distinguished experimental
nuclear physicist, Daehnick’s ear-
liest work used nuclear reactions
to decipher the orbital motion
of neutrons and protons, and
the orbit—changing collisions
between them, in atomic nuclei.
The bulk of this effort was done
at Pitt’s cyclotron and Van de
Graaf accelerators in the 19605
and 1970s, and he continued it
brieﬂy at higher energies at the
Indiana University cyclotron in
the early 1980s.

He also developed experi-
ments to study “weak interac-
tion,” one of the four funda-
mental interactions in nature.
Later, he led the effort by Pitt
and Indiana physicists to study the
production of pions (contributors
to the forces between neutrons
and protons) at extremely low
energies. Daehnick continued
to work on that problem until a
few weeks before his death.

Daehnick worked as a
research associate and instruc-
tor at Princeton University from
195 9 to 1962, prior to coming to
Pitt as assistant professor. He was
appointed associate professor in
1965 and professor in 1969. He
was named professor emeritus in
1996 upon his retirement from
Pitt. He also served as director
of Pitt’s Scaife Nuclear Physics
Laboratory, 1978-1979.

In addition to his duties as
a professor of physics and a
researcher, Daehnick served on
a number of University com.-
mittees. He was chairman of the

executive committee of Pitt’s

unreasonable estimate of what it
has cost Pitt to defend its refusal
to offer the beneﬁts, in violation
of municipal civil rights law, in
the last seven years.
The current situation is not
a matter of the big, bad ACLU
attacking the defenseless Univer-
sity. Nor is the refusal to offer
beneﬁts really about cost. I no
longer know what it’s about.

UNIVERSITY SI\IATE

IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

Most readers have read or heard statements
such as “information is power” or “knowledge is
power.” There is abundant evidence it is true. The
struggle over access to’ information is present in
a myriad of contexts.

Congress adopted the Freedom of Information
Act years ago in response to public pressure for
access to information in the federal governments
. a hands. It provides for disclosure of considerable
information but does not require release of other information,
such as that dealing with aspects of criminal law enforcement.
States also have adopted FOIAs.

There is also federal privacy legislation that limits disclosure
of personal information in the governments possession about
individuals. Regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act deal speciﬁcally with patient
information and impose a variety of requirements related to the
security and privacy of health information held by health care
providers, healthplans and certain other entities. 1

It sufﬁces to say itis clear that some federal and state law
directly relates either to making available or to keeping conﬁ-
dential certain Pitt-held data. - ‘

My interest in the information issue stems from reports of
difﬁculty encountered by members of the University community
in obtaining information from the University administration,
speciﬁc schools and their own departments. The issue of access
to information has been raised at Faculty Assembly and Senate
Council meetings. I refer here to information notrequired by
law to be maintained as conﬁdential, such as certain information
regarding students, absent authorization for disclosure from the
student, as well as infonnation the University is under no legal
obligation to provide. I

All organizations undoubtedly have information they desire
to keep secret; for some organizations secrecy is an obsession.
An astute observer recently said that secrecy prevents access to
information about conduct that is illegal, unethical or embarrass-
ing; that explains why much information is kept secret.

VV1th respect to Pitt, much of the information that appears
difﬁcult to obtain, atworst, might be embarrassing. My guess is
that some information sought and not obtained doesn’t even exist
in any recorded form. Sometimes the nature of the information

 

not, doneby the University, or a speciﬁc University official.

Apparently many administrators here, based on some of their’
actions, agree that information is power. Because they fear sharing
power, despite their public expressions of support for collegiality,
faculty and staff involvement, and the like, theywithhold informa-
tion or provide information in ways that obscure its meaning.

A wealth of information is made available through the Public
Affairs ofﬁce of the University. Take a look at Pitt Magazine,
the content of the Pitt Chronicle, and Research Notes in _the
UniversityTimes. The information selectively provided is almost
uniformly favorable; a good bit of it concerns research dollars”
coming to the University. But other information, not found in
releases from Public Affairs, seems to be closely guarded.

The response to requests of mine for information has often
been, “VVhy do you want it?” That may be a legitimate question
in some contexts. Should the “acceptability” of the reason for the
request be left solely to-an administrator who will be deciding
whether to permit access to infonnation he/ she controls? Arefusal
to provide information to a member of the University community
should be supported by a legitimate reason _— a reason indicating
the interest or values that come into play, and the potential harm T
the release of the information might create.

1 Sometimes no response to a request for information is made,
probably in the hope that the request will not be pursued. The
ENRON and other corporate debacles, and the mishandling of
large sums of money in the wake of 9/11 by charitable organiza-
tions such as the Red Cross, have prompted much talk, and a little
action, aimed at bringing about more transparency with respect
to information availability and comprehensibility.

, Refusal to give information is a stimulus to some to press
harder to obtain it, with-the expectation that whoever is block-
ing access to the information has something to hide. Of course,
a refusal often is not contested and the matter dies. '

, While law may not require that information be given, absence
of a legal requirement should not necessarily be determinative of

tion should be disclosed. Assuming no law governs the availability
of the information sought, a choice needs to be made between two
points of departure in framing a response. One is that requested
information should be disclosed, unless there is a good reason
not to disclose; the other is to disclose nothing, unless there is a
good reason to disclose. By good reason I mean that an important
societal or personal interest or value is involved.

Perhaps it is time for those in Pitt’s administration who control
information to review their policies, both formal and informal.
They might consider whether the point of departure they now use
in addressing information disclosure issues remains appropriate,
in light of the potential negative impact of refusals to disclose and
failures to respond to requests, without apparent justiﬁcation.l

Pitt denies making lst move in
re-opemng same-sex beneﬁt case

ontraryto claims byACLU
attorneys’ and others seek-
ing to force Pitt through

the courts to extend health
beneﬁts to employees’ same—sex

partners, the University has never ‘

Counsel Alan A. Garﬁnkel reiter-

“Our position has always

as amended in 1990 to prohibit
discrimination based on sexual
orientation, does not require
employers to offer health ben-
eﬁts to their employees’ same-
sex domestic partners,” Garﬁnkel
said. ,

Pitt re-stated that position in
a brief ﬁled in Allegheny County
Common Pleas Court last month,
askingJudge Robert Gallo to per-
manently bar the city’s Human
Rights Commission (HRC)
from hearing ‘ a discrimination
case against Pitt by seven cur-
rent and former employees.

the city ordinance by denying.

Gallo concluded then that “the
denial of health beneﬁts to Pitt
employees is based upon marital
status, not sexual orientation.”
Garﬁnkel said Pitt’s admin-
istration has no intention of
complying with a recent Faculty
Assembly resolution that asks the
administration “to instruct Uni-
versity attorneys to withdraw the
part of [last month’s] brief. . .that
attacks the validity of the Human
Rights Ordinance of 1990.”
Garﬁnkel said, “Our oppo-

nents would have us give the

benefits and follow the city

ordinance, which is in many
respects inconsistent with state
law.” He referred to a 1999 law
that exempts Pennsylvania’s state-
related universities from munici-
pal ordinances requiring them to
provide health beneﬁts.

In aJan; 21 response to Pitt’s
most recent brief, ACLU. attor-
neys representing the plaintiffs
said the state law amounted to
“stealth legislation” that was
enacted in a manner violating
Pennsylvania’s constitution. See

role as an administrator. “He was
no-nonsense and focused, and he
always had the best interests of
the University at heart. He will
be missed.”

Daehnick enjoyed both roles,

he told the University Times in

October 1994 after he decided ’

to step away from administra-
tion and return to the -physics
department as a full—time faculty
member.

“Let me say that I have had a
good time as an administrator,”
he said at that time. “I love both
administration and research, but
I love research more. I decided

that ﬁve years of reduced research '
. activity was more than is‘ safe in

a ﬁeld like physics. .
“Do I regret anything? Not
really,” Daehnick said. “If I had

' not tried my hand at being an

administrator, I think I would
be saying to myself today, ‘Well,
Daehnick, you always complain
about things not being done right
at this University. VVhy don’t you
do anything about it?’”

The Berlin—born Daehnick

received his B.S in physics with

a minor in electrical engineering
from the Technical University in
Munich in 1951. He earned an
M.S. in physicswith a minor
in mathematics from the Uni-
versity of Hamburg, Germany,
in 1955. A Ph.D. in nuclear

orientation, the city itself did not
feel compelled to award health
beneﬁts to city employees’ gay
and lesbian partners.

“The city never awarded
health benefits to same—sex
partners until 1999, when they
passed an amendment to the ordi-
nance, speciﬁcally requiring the
city to provide those beneﬁts,”
Garﬁnkel said. “VVhy would the
city need to amend its ordinance
in 1999 to provide these [same-
sex] beneﬁts if the original ‘sexual
orientation’ language of 1990
mandated it? ”

Attorneys from Pitt and the
ACLU have taken turns blam-
ing each other for breaking a 20-
month moratorium on litigation
in the same-sex beneﬁts case.

In May 2001, both sides had
agreed to a truce while a Uni-
versity committee made up of
trustees, administrators, faculty,
staff and students examined the
question of extending health
coverage to employees’ unmar-
ried partners. In June 2002, the
committee issued areport recom-
mending that Pitt eventuallyjoin
the growing number of employ-
ers offering health beneﬁts to
domestic partners — but that
it “would not ‘be prudent”. to
do so in the near future, partly

because of opposition among
state lawmakers.

According to Garfinkel,
it was the plaintiffs and their
ACLU lawyers who re-opened
litigation by trying to get the case
reassigned from Judge Gallo to
another Common Pleas judge,
Anthony Wettick.

“We resisted. Judge Wettick
agreed, and sent it back to Judge
Gallo, who set a schedule for
submitting briefs,” said Garﬁn-
kel. “Because Pitt had originally
initiated the case in Common
Pleas Court, we had to ﬁle our
brief ﬁrst. But it was never our
goal to re-open the case. We have
never believed that litigation was
the way to resolve this issue.”

The University Times could
not reach plaintiffs’ attorneys for
comment late yesterday.

Responding to criticism such

as one Faculty Assembly mem-

ber’s suggestion that Pitt’s legal
strategy “may be good lawyering,
but it’s bad ethics,” Garﬁnkel said:

“It’s a little difﬁcult to be called
‘morally bankrupt’ and ‘bigots’
in the newspapers by our oppo-
nents. I’ve been at Pitt for three
and a half years, and I must say
that I am surrounded by people
here who are anything but mor-
ally bankrupt and bigoted.”

He emphasized, “We are in
a defensive posture in this case.

We keep being painted as the V’

people who brought this legal
action, but we are the ones who
are being sued. We are the ones
who negotiated the moratorium
on litigation.”

Instead of suing the Uni-
versity, proponents of same-sex
beneﬁts at Pitt should lobby for
change in Harrisburg, Garﬁnkel
said.

Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg “has made exhaustive efforts
to work with his colleagues at the
other state—related universities, in
an effort to get a united front,”
said Garﬁnkel.

Assembly tables resolution
critical of Board of Trustees

in the Jan. 24 Pittsburgh

Post—Gazette, Pennsylvania
Supreme Court Chief Justice
Ralph J. Cappy defended the
compensation packages that he
and_other Pitt trustees recently
awarded to the University’s senior
administrators.

Cappy wrote that Chancellor
MarkA. Nordenberg himself had
argued eloquently, year afteryear,
against such substantial raises and

In an op-ed piece published

 V 

fear that they could be “miscon-
strued and damage important
campus relationships that had
been established over the course
of many years.”

But trustees overruled Nor-
denberg, according to Cappy.

Picking up on Cappy’s article,
Faculty Assembly onJan. 28 dis-
cussed—-but ultimatelyvoted 7-6
to table until its next meeting— a
resolution urging Pitt trustees to
“give greater heed in the future
to the chancellor’s concerns, as
reported in the media, about
very large increases to himself
and other top University ofﬁ-
cers in a time of severe campus
budgetary problems.”

As originally drafted by dental
medicine professor John Baker,
the resolution called on Faculty
Assembly to “censure” the trust-
ees, but other Assembly members
said that was going too far.

“The word ‘censure’ should
be reserved for very serious and
weighty matters,” said English
professor Phil VV1on.

Assembly members consid-
ered alternative verbs—“admon—
ish,” “decry,” “criticize” —before_
agreeing to the ﬁnal wording
written by Nathan Hershey of
the Graduate School of Public
Health.

Baker said he didn’t begrudge
Pitt ofﬁcers their 5.4’

to 13.9 percent salary raises
and $50,000—$75,000 annual
bonuses for remaining at the
University. “But the trustees’
letters justifying these increases
don’t bear up to scrutiny,” Baker
maintained.

Based on Nordenberg’s
total compensation of $377,720
(including base salary and other
compensation) for the 2 001 ﬁscal

year, Pitt’s chancellor ranked 2 3 rd
in the latest Chronicle of Higher
Education survey of chief execu-
tives’ compensation at 131 U.S.
public research universities,
noted Baker.

“For most of the chief execu-
tives included in that survey, the
Chronicle used 2002-03 com-
pensation, but for Chancellor
Nordenbergitwas 2000-01 data.
His new compensation package
moves him up to No. 7,” Baker

§iifd:‘~*“I”l51‘iiig’fﬁis’-ﬁﬁ‘l5E§é3i’ii§éf5”i‘If§*’ ‘—‘7"’3*”“

Board of Trustees said that one
of their reasons [for boosting the
chancellor’s compensation] was
that Chancellor Nordenbergwas
falling behind his peers.”

In recent letters to the
University Times and other
publications, Pitt trustees and
administrators reported that,
despite the fact that Pitt’s salary
increase pool was just 3 .5 percent
this year, 246 faculty received
raises greater than 10 percent and
149 got raises of greater than 15
percent; 880 staff members got
raises of 5 percent or more and
238 staff received increases of 10
percent or more.

“The problem with those
numbers is, they don’t tell you
what the base salary was for those
employees who received the high
percentage raise,” Baker said. “It’s
very easy to give a high percent-

_ age raise to someone wholhas a

low salary to begin with. But our
top executives were already very
well paid.”

Wion, who chairs the Uni-
versity Senate’s budget policies
committee, pointed out that
the numbers of employees who
received double—digit raises
included people who got pro-
motions — and who therefore
should have received gubstantial
raises commensurate to their new
titles, ranks and duties.

. With Pitt facing a hefty
increase in its health insurance
premiums and level funding, at
best, from the state, “we’re told

it’s going to be a very bad year,” .

Baker said. “But who’s the year
bad for? It’s not a bad year for our
top executives. We already know
they’re doing extremely well. It’s
a bad year for the rest of us.”

City planning okays BST3 plans

The Pittsburgh City Plan-
ning commission gave
Pitt the okay last week to
construct the Biomedical Science
Tower 3 (BST3), officials said.

The $188 million project,
approved by Pitt’s Board of
Trustees last October, had been
delayed by the City Planning
commission at a]an. 14 meeting,
when commissioners wanted to
study further the project’s park-
ing implications, according to
Director of City Planning Susan
Golomb.

“We had department staff
look at the parking situation
there,” Golomb said, referring
to the construction site at Fifth
Avenue between Lothrop and
Darragh streets, the site of the
razed Lhormer Building. “The
University said that [BST3]
would house 5 00 researchers and
scientists, and somecommission—
ers wanted to see if parking would
be adequate in the area.” A

Golomb said the internal
City Planning review eased the
concerns of the commissioners,
who gave their ‘ﬁnal approval
Jan. 28. ‘

“There will be. 100 speciﬁed
spaces in the Victoria Building
garage for [BST3 tenants], and
overall, of the 500 occupants

only about 200 or 250 will be
new to Oakland,” Golomb said.
She added that the UPMC plan
to move Children’s Hospital to
the former St. Francis Hospital
location in Lawrenceville would
alleviate trafﬁc congestion and
free up more parking in existing
garages over the next few years.

BST3 will be a l0-storylime—
stone and glass building housing
about 50 research groups in
about 330,000 gross square feet
of space. Pitt’s plan includes con-
structing connecting pedestrian
bridges from BST3 to Victoria
Hall and to the Biomedical Sci-
ence Tower.

Funding sources for the BST3
include: $62 million in gift funds;
$80 million in debt ﬁnancing;
$45 .4 million in University funds,
and $62 9,000 in commonwealth
funds, according to information
provided by the Board ofTrustees
property and facilities committee,
which authorized the project.

According to Ana Guzman,
associate vice chancellor for
Facilities Management, the
delay is a small bump in the
road. “The two—week delay did
not have any impact on the over-
all project schedule or budget for

the building,” Guzman said. “We L

plan to start mobilizing for con-

struction in early spring of this
year, have partial occupancy of
the building (lower ﬂoors) in the
spring of 2005 and completion
of construction in December of
2005.”

Guzman acknowledged that
staging issues for the BST3
construction still need to be
ironed out and submitted for
City Planning department staff
approval. “We may also, for
example, discuss with [the Port
Authority] about moving the

bus stop in that area during the
construction to help our staging,”
she said.

Planning department staff
member Bob Reppe said the
University still must submit:
detailed building drawings and
a ‘description of all materials;
a construction management
plan, which includes proposed
truck routes for the delivery of
materials, where the construc-
tion trailers will park and the
workers’ hours of operation; a
landscape plan, and a signage
proposal for the post-construc-
tion site. “These are all typical
conditions the department puts

on construction projects for the
staff to review,” Reppe said.

“We don’t normally require
submitting a construction man-
agement plan at the time of the
commission’s approval of the
project,” City Planning Director
Golomb said, “but the University
will have to come back to [depart-
ment staff] with that when those
details are worked out.”

The BST3 project does not
require Pittsburgh City Council
approval, Golomb said, because
it was approved by council as
part of the University’s revised
master plan.

Provost's Ad Hoc Committee 11 Academic Freedom

January 30, 2003

Open Meeting of Committee

The Provost recently convened an ad hoc Committee to advise him with
respect to the manner in which recent changes in the academic environment
(especially new instructional practices and changing budgetary support for
programs) may challenge traditional concepts of academic freedom and how
academic governance structures respond to such challenges.

The Committee has solicited input from Deans and representatives
of academic units throughout the University and has met with Deans and
representatives from many units, especially those with academic programs that
take instruction outside the traditional classroom/library/laboratory setting. _

To ensure that we have heard from all concerned faculty, the Committee
would like to invite all University of Pittsburgh faculty to an open meeting of
the Committee to be held on Monday, February 10, from 4:00-5:00 pm, in
Room 2P56 Posvar Hall. It would be helpful if individuals wishing to send
written statements to the Committee, or to make formal presentations to the
Committee (10 minutes maximum), would Contact Mrs. Linda Wykoff (Staff
Support to the Committee; Ofﬁce of the Provost; phone: 412-624-5750 or

UPMC setsup call center to
assist elderly, their families

To assist the elderly and their
families through the health care
and ﬁnance maze, the Institute on
Aging, a collaboration of Pitt and
UPMC Health System, has estab-
lished a toll-free call center.

The 24-hour non—emergency
number, l-866/430-8742, will
help callers access services,
information and resources both
within and outside of UPMC
Health System. _

The institute also launched a
web site, www.aging.upmc.com;
and access by e—mail is available
through aging@upmc.edu.

“The opening of this call
center comes at a time when the
demand for care of the elderly is
increasing,” said Neil Resnick,
director of the institute and pro-
fessor of medicine and chief of the
Division of Geriatric Medicine
and Gerontology at Pitt. _

Some 13 percent of Ameri-
cans today are over age 65.
But in western Pennsylvania,

_ nearly 18 percent of the region’s

population is 65 or older. Older
Americans represent the fastest
growing segment of the popula-
tion. According to the National
Institute on Aging, by 2030 the

‘number of people ages 65 and

older will double to reach 70.3
million, constituting 20 percent

of the U.S. population.

By contacting the call center,
the public can. acquire informa-
tion on a variety of subjects
impacting the elderly. These

include specialized clinical care, 3

home care, long-term care,
respite and other topics. Patient
educationmaterial also is avail-

able. .
A caller may be referred to any

of three UPMC Health System

geriatric assessment centers.

The toll-free telephone
and web site service can help
people:

' ﬁnd a physician specializing
in geriatrics and treatment pro-
grams and schedule appoint-
ments;

° learn about speciﬁc diseases 5

and treatment options;

° identify research studies and
clinical trials;

° identify community re-
sources for social services, insur-
ance, housing, transportation and
other concerns; _

° learn about programs that
provide caregiver support and
care coordination for older
adults.

The call center also can help
a person living elsewhere coor-

dinate care for a parent living in ;

western Pennsylvania.

Will lean year prompt creativity
in faculty & staff compensation?

CONTINUED FROM PAGE I
quite likely be a number of
lower-paid Pitt employees who
would ﬁnd themselves forced
to give up health insurance
beneﬁts —— single mothers with
children, for example,” Hershey
said. “I think this social concern
ought to enter into the faculty’s
assessment of policy with regard
to this particular allocation.”
Both Pitt and its employees
get “more bang for their bucks”
when the University allocates
compensation dollars to ben-
eﬁts rather than salary, Hershey

. maintained.

About 24 cents of every dollar
in salary earned by a city resident
in the lowest federal income tax
bracketgoes to pay city, state and
federal taxes, Hershey calculated.
The University itself pays Social
Security taxes on cash wages, in
addition to contributing to work-

ers comp and unemployment 2

insurance. -
, No such deductions are taken
out of dollars allocated for health
beneﬁts, Hershey noted.
Hershey serves on the plan-
ning and budget policies com-
mittee of the Graduate School of

. Public Health (GSPH) Council,

which recently endorsed the con-
cept of healthbeneﬁts—in—lieu—of—
salary, at least for next year.

But Hershey’s fellow Faculty

Assembly members weren’t sold

on the idea.

“As you hold down salaries,
there’s a compounding effect,”
said LewisJacobson of biological
sciences. With health insurance
costs increasing faster each year
than the Consumer Price Index
rate of inﬂation, Pitt salary
increases would fall increasingly
behind the CPI if Pitt adopted a
policy of absorbing health care
premiums at the expense of sala-
ries, said Jacobson. A

(Hershey replied that he
wasn’t recommending more
than a one—year change in Pitt7s
salary policy.)

“This University competes in
a national and, in some senses,
an international market for fac-
ulty, ”Jacobson added. “I strongly
suspect thatmost candidates for
faculty positions at this Univer-
sity do not, in fact, investigate in
detail the allocations of Univer-
sity money between fringe ben-

eﬁts and salaries. What are always -

published are salary rankings.”
Clark Muenzer, who chairs

the Germanic languages and lit—_

eratures department, noted that
employees’ tax—sheltered con-
tributions to TIAA—CREF and
Vanguard retirement annuities
come out of their salaries, not
their total compensation.

Thus, a health beneﬁts-in-

lieu-o_f—salary plan would not

appeal to higher—paid employees
who choose to have the maximum
of 8 percent withheld from-their
salaries for TIAA—CREF and] or
Vanguard — especially with
Pitt kicking in a matching, tax-
sheltered contribution of 12
percent.

Nor would such a plan be
advantageous for employees
who get health insurance through
their spouses’ policies, Assembly
members noted, although it
would be ﬁnancially beneﬁcial
for many single parents and/or
lower-paid employees (who are
less likely to participate in TIAA—

‘CREF/Vanguard or to have the
maximum contribution withheld ,

from their paychecks).

“Making a one—size-ﬁts-all
recommendation [for employee
compensation] will not be easy,”
said English professor Phil VV1on,
an Assembly member who chairs
the University Senate’s budget
policies committee and serves
on UPBC. A '

“Nonetheless, I think it’s very
important that this year, unlike
some years in the past, the UPBC
and Senate committees_get
involved in the decision about
the relative allocation between
salary and fringe beneﬁts, well

J in advance of the decision being

made,” Wion said.
In recentyears, Pitt’s adminis-

 

  

   

  

tration has invested more heavily
in campus construction, lab and
classroom renovations, and proj-
ects aimed at improving quality
of life for undergraduates, among
other areas, said Wion. “All of
this has helped to improve the
University, yes. But the tradeoffs
may need to go more toward com-
pensation this year.”

Foreseeing big hikes in Pitt’s.
health insurance premiums
in July 2003, the University
administration allocated $6
million of the current year’s
operating budget for one-time
expenses rather than continuing
expenses, VV1on noted.

“This was done precisely so
that that $6 million would be
available in the future for ‘con-
tinuing expenses,” he said. “It’s
money that is already in our
base budget and which could be
devoted to continuing expenses
next year such as health insurance
premiums.” I

VV1on pointed out that Pitt’s
salary budget increased by 3.5
percent last year; 1 percent was
centrally allocated to high-prior-
ity units, primarily to fund raises
for higher—paid faculty and staff

who are most in demand.
“Having taken care of the
better paid and the more for-
tunate,” Wion said, “this would
be a particularly good year to
really focus our attention on
those among us, especially staff,
who are poorly paid, relatively,
and who will be most severely
impacted by huge increases in our
health insurance premiums.”
There’s a precedent for award-
ing higher raises to lower-paid
employees under Pitt’s current
administration: In January
1996, then—Interim Chancellor
Nordenberg (who had inher-
ited a University-wide salary
freeze) approved a plan that
awarded raises to continuing
staff and faculty who were earn-
ing $35,000 or less and whose
supervisors gave them _satisfac-
tory job evaluations.
Increases, retroactive to the
previous July, ranged from 0.99

percent ($348) for employees

earning between $34,001 and
$35,000, to 2.35 percent ($540)
for those making $23,000 or less.
The previous year’s inflation rate
had been 2.7 percent.

Taking a look at school desegregation:
LRDC scientist discusses research as
part of new race center lecture series

Pitt’s new Center on Race
and Social Problems (CRSP), an
interdisciplinary center housed in
the School of Social I/Vork, was
established recently to promote
scholarship where racial issues are
at the intellectual core.

_7anet I/Vard Schoﬁeld, professor
of psychology and senior scientist at
Pitt’sLearningResearch and Devel-
opment Center, spo/ee last month on
“School Desegregation and Inter-
group Relations: Looking Back and
LookingForward”aspartofCRSP3r
inaugural lecture series.

Schoﬁeld has published exten-
sively on school desegregation,
including her study on “Black and
White in School: Trust, Tension or
Tolerance?” which won the 1983
Allport Intergroup Relations Prize
from the Society ﬁor the Psychological
Study of Social Issues.

Schoﬁeld is a member of the
board of the advisory committee on
Race and Ethnic Relations Among
I/buth at the National Academy of
Sciences. She also has served on the
National Advisory Panel on School
Desegregation Research.

Her lecture focused on 1978-
1983 research at a then—new
northeastern United States middle
school (grades 6, 7and 8) with 1,200

students; roughly halfwere white and '

halfwere A ﬁ‘ican American. In her
lecture she referred to the school 

th-e.~pseudonym-I/Vexler.-'‘ ' ..  

Sc/Joﬁe/d3" current work focuses
on school desegregation and inter-
group relations, as well as the eﬁfect
of computers on classroom social
processes. She is preparing a grant
proposal to do a ﬁ)llow—up research
study on the I/I/Iexler students she
interviewedfbr her original study.

CI

_]anet Schofield’s study of
Wexler middle school in the late
1970s focused on three topics:
how well the prevailing theory
for examining intergroup rela-
tions applied to the "school; the
differences in both structure and
function of intergroup relations
in a school environment, and the
ways racial and gender groups
view interaction, including how
observable stereotyping played a
role in intergroup relations.

“In examining the published
research at that time, I found
that most of it focused on a
very simple question: What is"
the effect of desegregation on
intergroup relations?” Schoﬁeld
said. “Unfortunately, the answer
to that question was extremely
unclear,” despite a fair amount
of research on the topic. “In fact,
there were a couple of reviews
that concluded the most striking
characteristic [of the research]
was its inconclusiveness.”

In examining the inconclusive
research, Schoﬁeld found two
recurring flaws. ‘

“VVhen I struggled to ﬁgure
out why research seemed incon-
clusive, I found that itwas due to a
very serious conceptual problem,
which was that researchers tooka
political term and in some cases a
legal term —— school desegrega-
tion —— and treated it as if it were

an independent variable that had
one particular meaning,” she said.
“But, in fact, desegregation is a

6

social situation with an incredible
variety of meanings at the school
and classroom level.”

Schoolswere deﬁned as deseg-
regatediwhether the percentage
of African American students was
5 percent or 70 percent.

“So you have a huge difference
in the makeup of student bodies,
and you also had a huge difference
in how the schools were struc-
tured and how they function,”
Schoﬁeld said. “Some schools had
major amounts of re—segregation
within classrooms, while others
made much more effort to have
heterogeneous classrooms.”

The second research ﬂaw
was the failure to maintain the

tion, that is, a situation in which

backgrounds attended the same

additional conditions, she said.

ronment.

“In Wexler’s 6th and 7th
grade, things came pretty close
to Allport’s contact conditions,”
Schoﬁeld said. “But in sharp con-
trast, in the 8th grade, there was
a formalization of very unequal
contact between African Ameri-
can and white kids,” because the
students were divided based on
test scores into an accelerated

: program where roughly 80 per-

cent of the students were white,
and the regular program, were 80
percent were African American.
The 8th grade also published
honor rolls, which was not the
case in the 6th and 7th grades.
“So, in the 8th grade, you had
a situation where differences in
achievement, which were no
doubt related to differences in
socio—economic background
of the students in the school,
were formalized in a way that

created unequal status for the’

theory.

Moreover, she said, the effect
of increased intergroup relations
among 7th graders carried over
to the following year when the
students got to the more struc-
tured 8th grade. “We found that
in almost every case kids sat next
to each other more than the kids
of the previous year’s 8th grade.
And these differences were sta-
tistically signiﬁcant.”

‘ Schoﬁeld’s team did parallel »

studies of the role of gender
in intergroup behavior and in
developing friendships.

“In all grades, girls showed
more clustering by race than
boys,” she said. Other observa-
tional studies in the classroom

netted the same result: There V

was always more mixing of races
among boys than girls.

Delving deeper, Schoﬁeld
then conducted a series of inter-
views which revealed that boys
and girls viewed friendship quite
differently.

“With girls you have what
might be called a family model
of friendship. They have a rela-
tively small number of friends,
and what‘ they did was to talk
about things, what affected

them, what they were worried .

“In all grades, girls showed

more clusterin b race than bo   s.”

“The theory that was best
suited to looking in this direc-
tion at the time I began work
was Gordon ‘Allport’s ‘contact
theory,’ which strongly inﬂu-
enced my efforts.”

What Allport, a promi-

nent educational researcher in
intergroup relations, suggested,
Schoﬁeld said, was that contact
between previously separate
and often hostile groups has the
potential to improve relation-
ships between them, but only
under certain circumstances:
equal status within the contact
situation, cooperation toward
mutually shared goals and the
support of the relevant authori-
ties for building relationships.
She felt Wexler was close
to the ideal place to study this
theory: It was a new school,

roughly half white and half

African American, where the :

administration was committed
to promoting a colorblind envi-

African Americans and the
white students. But this gave
us an opportunity to compare
the intergroup relations” from
separate perspectives.

Schoﬁeld and her research
team tracked the impact of con-
tact conditions, particularly the
impact on the voluntary inter-
racial association of students, by
measuring changes in lunchroom
seating patterns over time. (They
discounted the 6th graders for

this part of the study, because in.

a disciplinary move, an adminis-
trator mandated seating for those
students in the lunchroom.)

“We looked at inter-racial’

‘adjacencies,’ students voluntarily
sitting either next to or across
from each other. We predicted
there would be a decline in 8th
graders’ adjacencies over time
and an increase in 7th graders’.
The indices acted exactly as we
had predicted,” she said, verify-
ing some of the tenets of contact

about. There was a lot of self-
disclosure,” Schoﬁeld said.

~ I Boys, on the other hand, were
more activity-oriented. “They
did things with their friends,
rather than talking about feelings.
And many of the things they did
required lots of people, including
games and sports,” she said.

The implications along racial
lines included “that girls tended
to "stick more closely to those
with whom they felt the most
comfort, which in this case, was
racial membership,” Schoﬁeld
said. “Boys were interested in
creating a ‘dominance hierarchy’:
VVho is on top? And if that’s of
interest to you, you have to
include everybody. It helps create
interaction between white and
African American kids.”

The same interviews explored
how children’s interpretations
were inﬂuenced by stereotypes
and expectations; in particular,

whether children would interpret V

an ambiguously aggressive act as
more threatening when the per-
petrator was African American
than when he was white.

“For example, we noticed that
both whites and African Ameri-
cans shared the stereotype of
African Americans as ‘noticeably
tougher,’ which is consistent with
other research in adult popula-
tions where you ﬁnd the same
stereotypes, especially in white
populations,” Schoﬁeld said.

The researchers used artists’
depictions of students bumping
into other students in school
hallways.

“Our hypothesis was con-
ﬁrmed, comparing the reactions
of 40 6th grade white boys and
40 6th grade African American
boys using all combinations of
[the race of] the actors and per-
petrators: Kids rated behaviors as
more mean and threatening when
African American kids were the
perpetrators than when white

_ kids were. In other words, kids ’

interpreted the same behaviors
differently depending on the
skin color of the perpetrator,”
she said.

“Because the artist—drawn
scenarios were identical, except
for hair and skin coloration‘, there
was no way we could have created
that phenomenon. You can see
that there are a number of poten-
tial problems where one group
sees behavior as friendly and
others don’t. It opens up room
for misinterpretation, and there’s
room for a lot of friction.”

Schoﬁeld said this led her

- research team to certain con-

clusions’ and cautions‘ about

I the .effectiveness of -a. colorblind

perspective based on how it func-
tioned in Wexler.

“People in the school strongly
endorsed the idea of having a col-
orblirid perspective, both black
and white teachers and admin-
istrators,” Schofield pointed
out. “VVhen you see reactions
to invidious distinctions that are
made on the basis of race, you
can see why the colorblind per-
spective was looked on as helpful.
And, inthe short term, it did often
avoid conﬂict controversy.”

However, she said, their.

research suggested potential
negative consequences of a col-
orblind perspective, including:

’ The perspective made much
less salient the importance of
examining modes of instruc-
tion, _curriculum content and
disciplinary practices to ensure
that needs of children from dif-
ferent backgrounds were met. “In
fact, at Wexler, suspension rates
between whites and African
Americans were quite different,
and when discussions about that
came up, administrators said, ‘We
treat people as individuals, so we
don’t even need to look at this.’
It’s a perspective that keeps one
from thinkingabout potentially
serious institutional issues,”
Schoﬁeld said. ,

0 A colorblind perspective

can lead people to be complacent

regarding re-segregation. “Ifyou
don’t see color, then large groups

clustered together by race doesn’t
really matter, because you can’t
‘see’ that. That’s potentially
a serious problem in a school‘
designed to try to improve rela-

tions, especially if you believe in

the model that suggests contact
is important in developing inter-

group relationships.”

FEBRUARY 6, 2003

New immigration laws affect faculty, staff as well as students

he_ terrorist attacks of

Sept. ll, 2001, have

spawned unprecedented
changes in U.S. immigration
laws and regulations, which
are directly affecting the lives
— both academic and personal
— of foreign nationals at Pitt,
including approximately 1,100
faculty and staff members and

V their dependents.

A few examples, as described
during a Feb. 3 “Immigration
Law Update” town meeting
sponsored by Pitt’s Ofﬁce of
International Services (OIS):

° New guidelines under the
National Security Entry—Exit
Registration System require
males born on or before Novem-
ber 1986, and who are nationals
or citizens from a growing list
of countries, to register at U.S.
ports of entry or Immigration and
Naturalization Service ofﬁces.
(Pittsburgh’s designated office is
at 1000 LibertyAve., Downtown.
No appointment isrequired for
registering.) Listed countries
currently include Afghanistan,
Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh,-
Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran,

Committee

named for

AD search

Chancellor Mark A. Nor-

gdenbergbthis week an_nounced

the appointment of Ta commit-
tee to. launch a national search
for a new athletics director.
Former AD Steve Pederson
resigned in December to assume
a similar post at the University of
Nebraska. _

FollowingPederson’sresigna-
tion, Marc Boehm was. named
interim director of athletics.
Boehm had been associate ath-
letics director since 1997.

Members of the committee
are: Susan Albrecht, associate
dean in the School of Nursing and
the University’s faculty represen-
tative to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA);
Brian Beinecke, former line-
backer on the Panthers football
team who is now a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Health and
Rehabilitation Sciences; Thomas
Bi gley, retired managing partner
of Ernst & Young and immedi-
ate past chair of the Pitt Board
of Trustees athletics committee;
Kirk Bruce, Pitt’s assistant athlet-
ics director for Olympic sports
and former" women’s basketball
coach; Jerome Cochran, Pitt’s
executive vice chancellor; John
Conomikes, chair of _the execu-
tive committee of Hearst Argyle
Television Inc. and chair of the
Pitt Board of Trustees athletics
committee; John Elliot, director
of Internal Audit and chair of the
University’s NCAA certiﬁcation
steering committee, and Donna
Sanft, Pitt’s associate athletics
director for student life and
compliance.

Cochran will chair the com-
mittee. He was chair of the
University’s last search com-
mittee for an athletics director
in 1996. Albrecht, Bigley and

. Conomikes also served on that

-earlier committee. I

Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Libya, Morocco, North Korea,
Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,
Tunisia, United Arab Emirates
and Yemen. Registration is not
required for U.S. lawful perma-
nent residents and those who have
applied for and/ or been granted
asylum.

° By Aug. 1, all current inter-
national students and scholars at
Pitt must be registered, through
OIS, in the new Student and
Exchange Visitor Information
System (SEVIS), a computerized
tracking system. International
students and scholars also must
submit information about their
dependents on separate forms.
SEVIS was created to meet
requirements of the Enhanced
Border Security and Visa Entry
Reform Act of 2 002 and the 2002

, USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.

' Beginning March 1, the
U.S. Immigration and Natu-

ralization Service (INS) will be

dissolved and its functions reas-
signed to two bureaus within the
new Department of Homeland
Security. The new bureaus will
have the authority to reverse visa

approvals made by State Depart— ‘

ment consular ofﬁcers. Consular

ofﬁcers will be required to record ,

in a database detailed informa-
tion about every applicant denied
a visa.

According to Pitt OIS direc-
tor David Bryan‘ Clubb, these
changes probably will slow pro-
cessing time for visas and “create

.an..em:irQr1m.ent .where.,tI;_<ayisa_. . ,_

issuance process is no longer
concernedwith customer service,
nor sympathetic to the needs of
businesses and/or universities
in both obtaining visas quickly
for critical personnel or having
certainty in the timeframe of the
visa issuance process.” ' -
Addressing international stu-

dents and scholars in the Wil- »

liam Pitt Union audience, OIS
associate director Linda Gentile
said: “If you have any doubts or
questions related to your status
and what you can or cannot do,
please ask. We’d much rather
answer the question in advance

than tell you later that there’s a
problem that we may or may not
be able to ﬁx.”

Chancellor Nordenberg sent
letters to the winners, citing some
of their accomplishments.

Teaching  
° The me ical school’s Wil-
liam de Groat was recognized by
the chancellor for contributions
to teaching pharmacology in

diverse settings within and out- p

side the school over 35 years.
Nordenberg wrote that de
Groat excelled at exploring the
link between basic and clinical
settings using a problem-solv-
ing approach and incorporat-
ing historical context, research
’ and personal
experience
to stimulate
students.
His ba-
sic science
course in
m e d i ea 1
pharmacol-

 

- theatre over

ogy, the chancellor wrote, is
“highly valued by first—year
medical students, who appreciate
your expertly organized lectures,
interactive course format and the
respect you show them.”

De Groat’s teaching success
extends to second-year and
graduate courses as well as to
the mentoring of undergradu-
ates and pre- and post-doctoral
fellows in the laboratory, the
chancellor wrote.

De Groat is a prior winner of
the Chancellor’s Distinguished
Research Award.

°Johnstown theatre professor
Rodney Eatman was acknowl-
edged’ by " '
Nordenberg
for teaching
and mentor-
ing majors
and non-
majors in all
aspects of

    

a 24-year
career at UPJ, using a demand-
ing yet nurturing and encourag-
ing approach.

The chancellor cited Eatrnan
as a talented actor, director,
keyboard artist and playwright,
who pushes students “to stretch
their imaginative and creative
muscles” through careful and

tactful feedback.

“Almost single—handedly,” '

the chancellor wrote, “you have
been the heart and driving force
of the theatre department over
the years, and your campus has
beneﬁted greatly from your dedi-
cated and skillful teaching.”
0 Joseph Grabowski was
praised for his innovative teach-
.  ing oforganic
chemistry
and pioneer-
ing contri-
butions to
"education in
the chemis-
try depart-
ment, as well
as for his inﬂuential articles in the
Journal of Chemical Education
and national presentations on
teaching innovation.

 

“You enrich your meticulous

PowerPoint'.lectures with a vari-
ety ofcreative materials, including
web—based animations, practice
problems, group projects, peer-
led team learning groups, web-5
based self—assessments and your
Jeopardy! game,” Nordenberg
wrote. “Your high expectations
motivate your students, and you
create a learning environment
that incorporates their diversity
of learning styles.”

The chancellor also praised
Grabowski for promoting
experientia-1 learning outside
the classroom through directed
summer research opportunities
for undergraduates. Norden-
berg wrote that departmental
colleagues. have beneﬁted from
Grabowski’s leadership in sharing
applied technology in the class-
room, his efforts at curriculum
revision and his monthly teaching

V seminars.

’ ° John Kreit was cited by
Nordenberg for his dedication as
a clinical educator who has been
recognized by colleagues and by
second-year medical students,

“who awarded Kreit the school’s

 

 

outstanding teaching award for
the past two years.

“Residents have selected you
to receive their clinical teaching
award numer— 
ous - times,
praising your
p a t 1 e n c e ,
enthusiasm,
unique bed-
side teach-
ing skill and .
intellectual 
curiosity,” Nordenberg wrote.

He also cited Kreit for enrich-
ing the education of fourth-year
students, residents and fellows in
the clinical care setting through
formal’ and informal lectures,
close supervision and research
training. '

° Deborah Studen—Pavlov-
ich of dental medicine was cited
byNordenberg as a role model, “a
teacher whose attention to detail,
organization and integration of
clinical cases and self-study
units make the classroom come
alive, and whose nurturing of,

  
   

~ and respect for, students enrich

their preclinical and clinical
experiences.” ‘
The chancellor praised her

for developing, implementing
' and administering the .pediat—

ric dentistry
p r o g r a m ,
and for her
teaching
the didactic,
preclinical
-. .'an;x:L.;clvinical
components
of the curriculum.

P “You sing1e—handedly have
created a thorough and well-inte-
grated program and you impart

your dedication andpassion for v

the profession in your numerous»

teaching, advising and mentoring _

activities,” Nordenberg wrote.
The chancellor pointed
out that Studen—Pavlovich
was selected by the American
Dental Association as one of the
25 “dental visionaries” for the
21st century, whose work will

help shape the future of Ameri-

can dentistry.

Research

° Senior scholar Isabel Beck
of the education school was cited
for her research contributions
to the study of reading instruc-

.. tion. “You
effectively
combine a
theoretical '
approach
based on the

v C o gni tive
theory A of
reading with
experience and awareness of
classroom instruction,” Norden-
berg wrote. He also pointed to

.Beck’s awards from the National

Reading Conference and the
International Reading Associa-
tion, as well as her membership
in the reading association’s Hall of
Fame. “Your outstanding record
of research and scholarship adds
to the distinction of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh,” Nordenberg
wrote.

° Of chemistry's Kay Brum-
mond Nordenberg wrote, “You
have made seminal contributions
in your ﬁeld through the devel-
opment of novel synthetic meth-

 

ods,.focusing
speciﬁcally
on organo—
m e t all i c
processes
and their
application
to the syn-
thesis of bio-
logically rel-
evant molecules.” Junior scholar
Brummond also invented an new
variant of the Pauson-Khand
reaction to create a complex
natural. product, Nordenberg
added. “This work is widely
recognized as one of the most
visible synthetic achievements
in the last few years.”
' Junior scholar Jeffrey
I Lawrence

of biologi-

enjoys an
international
reputation in
the burgeon-

 

microbial
genome evolution, which has
attracted research associates as

well as students to a thriving‘

laboratory environment at Pitt,
Nordenberg pointed out. “Of
particular note are your bioin-
formatics and computational
approaches to understanding
genome evolution, which you
have used to calculate the fre-
quencies and mechanisms by
which horizontal gene exchange

. in bacterial evolution operate_s,”

N ordenberg wrote.

- ° Anthropology’s’ Jeffrey

the senior
scholar. “Your colleagues
describe you as an imaginative
and highly original thinkerwhose
work is innovative and inspiring
——appropriate descriptors for one

    

-of the world’s leading experts on

human and_non-human primate
evolution,” Nordenberg wrote.
He added that Schwartz’s book

ser-ies, “The Human Fossil

Record,” is the single most a

important reference on the sub-
ject. “It’s little wonder than even
those who disagree with some of
your ideas believe that these ideas
cannot be ignored.”

0 Senior scholar Craig
Wilcox of chemistry was praised
by the chancellor for his seminal
work in physical organic chem-
istry, molecular recognition and
combinatorial chemistry. “You
introduced Trogler’s base, which,
along with a few other ‘select
molecules, is recognized as one
of the eneral motifs of molecular
recogni_tion,”

facilities and insurers could save
millions of dollars each year,
while still giving many couples
an answer for their losses, said
W. Allen Hogge, professor of
obstetrics, gynecology and repro-
ductive sciences and associate
professor of human genetics at
Pitt’s School of Medicine.
Hogge, who also is a clinical
investigator at Magee-Womens
Research Institute and medical

. director of genetics at Magee-
Womens Hospital, presented his T

ﬁndings Jan. 27 at the annual
meeting of the South Atlantic
Association of Obstetricians

and Gynecologists. Results of
the study also will be published
in an upcoming issue of the
American Journal of Obstetrics
and Gynecology.

“Recurrent miscarriage is
deﬁned clinically as three con-
secutive pregnancy losses,” said
Hogge. “But even an extensive
work-up will fail to find a rec-
ognizable cause in up to half of
these cases.”

Hogge and his colleagues ana-
lyzed the results of karyotyping
tests to determine the chromo-
somal characteristics of cells on
517 tissue samples from miscar-
riages gathered over nearly ﬁve
years at Magee-Womens Hos-

pital. Overall, nearly 56 percent
were found to have chromosomal
abnormalities, with even higher
rates of abnormalities when
adjusted for maternal age. More
than 82 percent of miscarriages
were found to be chromosom-
ally abnormal in women age 35
or over.

“Because 50 percent to 70
percent of miscarriages can
be attributed to chromosomal
abnormalities, and one in ﬁve
pregnancies ends in miscarriage,
many second and third miscar-
riages are likely to be simply
by chance alone. In addition,
other studies have shown that

these couples have a 70 percent

chance of having a successful"

subsequent pregnancy,” Hogge
said. ‘‘If there is a chromosomal
abnormality, there’s no reason to
do more extensive — and expen-
sive — testing.”

Hogge and his colleagues rec-
ommend that karyotyping tests
be pursued regularly after the
second loss, with more advanced
diagnostic tests ordered for both
parents only when no genetic
abnormality is found. “Having
an explanation for the loss
often removes signiﬁcant guilt
regarding whether the couple
‘did something wrong to cause
the miscarriage,”’ he said.

recovery of
high school
athletes from
mild cases of
concussion

High school athletes who
sustained even mild concussions
showed signiﬁcant decline in
memory processing and other
symptoms within one week post-
injury, in a study conducted by
researchers at the UPMC Sports
Medicine Concussion Program.

     

Recruiting Healthy Children
for Research Studies

The study, published in the
February Journal of Neuro-
surgery, is the ﬁrst to evaluate
recovery from mild concussion
in high school athletes and the
ﬁrst to show that even mild
concussions can have signiﬁcant
effects, suggesting the need for
more cautious return-to-play
guidelines. A

“ Our ﬁndings underscore the
need for more careful on—the—
ﬁeld evaluation of even seemingly
mild concussions,” said principal
investigator Mark Lovell, who is
a neuropsychologist and director
of the UPMC Sports Medicine
Concussion Program. “Fur—
thermore, our study results may
lead to a suggestion that any high
school athlete with a suspected
concussion of any severity be kept
out of that particular game and
not return to play until further
neurocognitive testing can be
done,” he said.

Currentretum—to—playguide—
lines commonlyused nationwide
stipulate that a mildly concussed
athlete whose on-the-ﬁeld symp-
toms. disappearwithin 15 minutes
may be allowed to return to play
in that particular game. .

study results suggest an urgency
for more research into the effects
of concussion in high school
athletes, as well as the access to
formal neurocognitive testing at
the high school level,” Lovell
added.

“There are 1.25 million high
school athletes playing contact
sports, which represents the
population with the highest
participation in contact sports
and the highest risk for sports-
related concussion. An estimated
63,000 concussions occur in this
group each year,” he said.

“Mild concussion is the most
frequently occurring type of
concussion. Because on—the—ﬁeld
symptoms disappear within a few
minutes and the athlete reports
he or she is ﬁne and appears to
the sports medicine team to be
ﬁne, mild concussions often are
unrecognized, overlooked’ or
considered a trivial injury, and
often the athlete is allowed to
return to play,” said Michael
Collins, study investigator
and neuropsychologist who is
assistant director of the UPMC
program. '

“We are concerned about
returning a concussed athlete to
play too soon before the brain has
had time to heal because previous
research has shown that once an
athlete sustains an initial concus-
sion, he is more susceptible to
further, more serious damage,”
said Collins, who also was prin-
cipal investigator for a recent

. UPMC study, proving t_‘hat_the

effects of mu1£ip1e‘=5anéussi61i§‘

in high school athletes can be
cumulative. T »
Concussion occurs when the
brain is violently rocked back
and forth inside _of the skull due_
to a blow to the head or upper
body. p
“Most athletes who sustain
an initial concussion can recover
completely as long as they are not
returned to contact sports too
soon,” said study investigator
Joseph Maroon, professor of
neurological surgery at UPMC.
“However, the concern is that
concussion symptoms are not
always straightforward and not
always reported by the athlete.
On—the'-ﬁeld evaluation of the
inju1y’s effects and knowingwhen
it is safe to return the athlete to
play can be difﬁcult to objectively

measure.”

The UPMC team studied the
recovery of 64 male and female
high school athletes through-
out the country who sustained
concussions during the 2000-
2001 school year. The athletes

who sustained mild concussions

were those whose symptoms
disappeared within 15 minutes
of injury. They were evaluated
on the ﬁeld by a certiﬁed athletic
trainer or team physician, who
documented the injury details.
The athletes were then evalu-
ated at 36 hours post—injury, four
days post-injury and seven days
post—injury. ‘

Athletes with mild concus-
sions demonstrated signiﬁcant
declines in memory processes
that were still evident at four
and seven days post-injury.
Other self—reported symptoms
-— including headaches, dizzi-
ness and nausea —— resolved by
day four.

,The mild concussion group

Hormone leads
to increase in
bone mineral
density

Large doses of a bone anabolic
hormone called parathyroid hor-
mone-related protein, PTHrP,
increases spine bone mineral
density in post—menopausal
women by almost 5 percent in
only three months, according
to a Pitt study published in the
February issue of the Journal
of 5 Clinical Endocrinology and
Metabolism.

“Our study results were
remarkable since PTHrP was
found to produce significant
results in only three months when
it would normally take as much as
one to three years for this much
of an increase to occur using most
currently available treatments,”
said Mara Horwitz, assistant
professor of clinical medicine
in the Division of Endocrinol-
ogy and Metabolism and lead
investigator in the study. “Even
though this was a small study, this
research takes us one step further
in identifying an anabolic agent
that can be effective even in the
short term.”

The double blind, placebo
controlled randomized clinical
study enrolled 16 postmeno-
pausal women with osteoporo-
sis between the ages of 50 and
75. All had been on hormone
replacement‘ therapy for an
average of eight years and still
had osteoporosis. Women who
had been taking any other type
of osteoporosis medication
were excluded from the study.
Half of the participants received
a self—administered injection
of PTHrP and the other half
received a placebo. The patients
were followed for three months.
Despite the large dose of PTHrP
as compared to other osteopo-
rosis medications, participants

tolerated the treatment without '

developing hypercalcemia, hypo-
tension, nausea, ﬂushing or other
adverse effects.

“The rate of bone mineral

Stewart, chief of the Division of
Endocrinology and Metabolism
at Pitt and senior author of the
study. “Increases of this~mag—_
nitude have not been reported
using calcitonin or raloxifene
even when they are used for as
long as three years. They com-
pare very favorably to the recently
approved parathyroid hormone
(PTH), a very exciting newly
FDA-approved bone anabolic
agent for osteoporosis.”

Even though the study was
designed as a pilot, the results
were surprisingly more favor-
able than expected, according
to Stewart. Because of the small
number of participants, a larger

study will be needed to conﬁrm
the results. Also, he added, no
data are available on the PT HrP ’s
ability to prevent fractures.
PTHrP is one of several
normal hormones that regulate
calcium metabolism. It was dis-
covered by several investigators
including Stewart in 1987 and is
responsible for hypercalcemia
in cancer patients. Since that
time, Stewart’s research has led
to the puriﬁcation, sequencing
and synthesis of PTHrP. Based
on the results of this study,
Stewart has formeda company,
Ostotrophin, L.L.C., to enable
large-scale" studies of PTHrP for
commercialization.

Study finds
cost-effective
treatment for
severe sepsis
The only FDA-approved
drug for the treatment of severe
sepsis, drotrecogin alfa (acti-
vated) (Xigris), is a cost—effective

treatment and has a cost~beneﬁt -

ratio superior or similar to'that
of many widely used medical

V treatments, according to a Pitt-

led study published in thejanuary
issue of _the journal Critical Care
Medicine .“

In -“Cost-effectiveness of
Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) in
the Treatment of Severe Sepsis,”
researchers led byDerekAngus,
a Pitt associate professor of criti-
cal care medicine, also report that
the drug is ’ signiﬁcantly more

join us for a delicious brunc/rand

- severe sepsis patients at highest

risk of death, and that the drug
saves lives without signiﬁcantly
increasing short—term costs or
use of medical resources. ‘

“Our study shows that the
cost—effectiveness of drotreco-
gin alfa (activated) is in line with
many other life—saving medical
interventions,” Angus said.
“Cost—effectiveness, rather than
price alone, is the true measure
of a drug’s value, and ought ‘to
be our bottom line when making
critical treatment decisions in
severe sepsis and other serious
conditions.”

Irnportantly, the study also
looked at the effect of drotreco-
gin alfa (activated) on the costs
of other aspects of care. *

The authors found that there
was no signiﬁcant change in other
hospital or short—terrn costs of
care: the sole economic impact
on hospitals was the acquisition
cost for the drug, and there
was no effect on other hospital
costs, such as duration of ICU
care. Previous studies have shown

a that drotrecogin alfa (activated)

improved patients’ short— and
long-term survival, and that the
majority of survivors are dis-
charged directly to home rather
than requiring care at another
institution. .

“Hospitals and pharmacies
are certainly faced with painful
choices in today’s cost—contain—
ment environment and, from
a practical standpoint, need to

Angus. “The recent commitment
from Medicare to offset costs
should be seen as a great help i
this regard.” ‘

The Medicare, Medicaid
SCI-IIP Beneﬁts Improvement
and Protection Act of 2000 is
designed to address the increased
cost to hospitals of new treat-
ments by providing additional
payments to hospitals that pro-
vide new technologies or services
that substantially improve patient
outcomes.

The Centers ofMedicare and
Medicaid Services determined
that drotrecogin alfa (activated)
meets the required criteria and,
since Oct. 1, 2 002, hospitals have
been eligible for additional com-
pensation when using the drug
for Medicare patients.

Computer
modeling can
evaluate
rupture
potential of
abdominal
aortic

I aneurysms .

Scientists at Pitt’s McGowan
Institute for Regenerative Medi-
cine have developed a computa-
tional tool to predict the rupture
potential for individual abdomi-
nal aortic aneurysms (AAA), an
advance that could positively
impact the lives of thousands of
patients a year. A .

Aneurysms result when the
wall of a blood vessel becomes

9.::.,...<.1,fs1..r.rr1.'-.1s.'e.s.1,, ,.Qv.9r_  ,

the constant pressure of blood
ﬂowing through the weakened
vessel can cause a section of it to
slowly enlarge, creating a bulge.
The majority of aneurysms are
called AAAs because they are
located in the abdominal aorta,
a large blood vessel leading from
the heart through the abdomen.
Others can occur in the brain.
These are called cerebral aneu-
rysms.

The popular view is that aneu-
rysms strike rarely, suddenly and
unpredictably. In fact, most lethal
AAAs are easy to diagnose with
an inexpensive ultrasound test,
and can usually be Heated. The
question is when.

“Until now, all abdominal
aortic aneurysms have been
treated more or less the same
way in that they are surgically
repaired when the maximum

diameter reaches a certain size-

— usually ﬁve centimeters,” said
David Vorp, assistant professor
of surgery and bioengineering
at Pitt’s School of Medicine and
director of the Vascular Bio-
mechanics and Vascular Tissue
Engineering Research laborato-
ries at the McGowan Institute.

“We are looking at AAA in
a more biomechanical way; that
is to say that material failure, or
a rupture, will occur when the
stress at any point exceeds the
strength of the material.”

Vorp presented these ﬁndings

‘last week at “Bringing Basic Sci-

ence Into Clinical Practice,” the
2003 Congress on Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysms, an interna-
tionalsymposium sponsored by

the vascular surgery department
at the Karolinska Instituteand.

Hospital. The symposium is
designed for vascular surgeons,
radiologists, researchers and
other professionals interested in
AAA treatment. ,

U.S. surgeons repair about
50,000 AAAs yearly, typically
replacing the bulging area with
a plastic or fabric tube. Some now
use a less-invasive procedure that
threads a tubular device called a
stent—graft into the weakened
area.

“But because surgical repair
carries its own risks, being able
to pinpointwhen an AAAis likely
to rupture gives surgeons a valu-
able tool,” said Elena DiMar-
tino, a research associate in Pitt’s
Department of Surgery who is
a member of Vorp’s team and
worked on the study.

“We know at a certain point
that the aneurysm will rupture,”
she said. “We are trying to predict
when.”

Only follow—up clinical stud-
ies can help to validate this new
technology, Vorp and DiMartino
said. While additional studies are
planned soon, a clinical trial in
patients is a more long—term
project.

Over the last 20 years, the
number of intact AAAs diag-
nosed in the United States has
tripled to about 200,000 a year,
partly because of the increased
use of computed tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging
and other diagnostic scans.
Most, however, are never diag-
nosed, resulting in the deaths of
about 18,000 Americans a year
of rupture — more than AIDS
or brain cancer, and four times
as many as cervical cancer. - . I
